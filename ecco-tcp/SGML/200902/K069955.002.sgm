<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. TO THE HONOURABLE MRS. B.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Helveot&s;luice&punc;</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not think we can enter on the SECOND SHFAF of our GLEANINGS better, than attending to what a traveller is mo&s;t embar|ra&s;&s;ed about on his fir&s;t landing&mdash;the be&s;t and cheape&s;t mode of proceeding on his journey: &s;ince it is but too certain, that all the informa|tion which he can get from books, on this &s;ub|ject, is very in&s;ufficient.&mdash;The tour-makers, indeed, have hurried on, as deeming the fir&s;t port too trifling to merit their notice: and, either di&s;gu&s;ted with, what they have called, impo&s;itions, fatigued with their voyage, or wi&s;hing to "ru&s;h into the mid&s;t of things" all at once, they have made a &s;ort of <HI>running &s;ight,</HI> from whom they conceive to be enemies of their pur&s;es, and &s;it down "in the &s;ick &s;it," to give &s;plenetic accounts of their &s;kirmi&s;hes
<PB N="2" REF="17">with boatmen, porters, and waggoners, <HI>currente calamo.</HI></P>
<P>In all this, there happens nothing but what mu&s;t be expected from &s;o much ha&s;te, namely, folly and ignorance. The direct rever&s;e of &s;uch conduct would be knowledge and truth: the effects would alter with the cau&s;es.</P>
<P>So far from the <HI>place of landing,</HI> in <HI>any</HI> coun|try, being unimportant, it &s;hould be looked upon as the key to every other, by who&s;e aid alone we can open the cabinet of its curio&s;i|ties, and become acquainted with its &s;ecrets. A general may as well affect to &s;light a frontier town, as a traveller his port of arrival; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, in both ca&s;es, is of the fir&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Under this a&s;&s;urance, I &s;hall take it for granted, neither you, nor any per&s;on, into who&s;e hands the&s;e papers may fall, will deem the time mi&s;u&s;ed which is to be occupied in giving full in&s;tructions on this nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub|ject; and you &s;hall judge, from what follows, whether travellers have not left more <HI>Gleanings</HI> than they ought to have done at the port of Helveot&s;luice.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="18">For the &s;ake of a thorough intelligence, let us &s;toop a little to take up the &s;ubject in the out&s;et. On <HI>your</HI> &s;ide of the water, a common London Directory will in&s;truct tho&s;e, who can|not plea&s;antly afford the luxury of a chai&s;e, that the coach goes to Harwich every mail|day, at &s;even in the morning, from the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch-&s;treet, and arrives in time to give the pa&s;&s;engers refre&s;hment before the packet &s;ails, as well as to get the pa&s;s from the king's agent in that town. This pa&s;&s;port co&s;ts twelve &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, on pay|ment of which there is u&s;ually a demur on the part of my countrymen, to a&s;k <HI>what it is paid for?</HI> when this an&s;wer as u&s;ually en&s;ues&mdash;<HI>for the King!</HI> Hereupon follow, commonly, the <HI>whys and wherefores,</HI> by the reverberation and multiplication of which, &s;omething, even more valuable than money, is lo&s;t&mdash;time and tem|per; and after <HI>they</HI> are gone, the &s;aid twelve &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence mu&s;t neverthele&s;s ac|tually be paid. A man about to be decapi|tated, may as well rea&s;on with the axe, while his head is laid upon the block by the &s;trong hand of the law, as di&s;pute with an agent of government about the payment of a tax; and yet, I fear, &s;carcely one traveller, out of one hundred, but comes away growling at the
<PB N="4" REF="19">&s;hameful impo&s;ition of the legi&s;lature, at <HI>this &s;ine for quitting the country.</HI>&mdash;Thus, my poor, dear, argumentative countrymen are put out of humour, even on the edges of England.&mdash; I wi&s;h, therefore, to <HI>prepare</HI> them for this grand event; and, moreover, to a&s;&s;ure them, that, if they are in wrath with the Mini&s;ter, who <HI>impo&s;es</HI> the tax, they ought to be &s;o with the agent who <HI>receives</HI> it, only in the propor|tionate ratio of <HI>eleven &s;hillings to eighteen-pence,</HI> as the <HI>latter</HI> pittance is, truly, the whole of the &s;um, on each pa&s;&s;port, that finds its way into the &s;aid agent's pocket&mdash;But, that my an|gry friends may know the whole of their mis|fortunes at once, (which is always &s;omething) I will be generous enough to apprize them, that they will have the <HI>&s;ame</HI> taxation to pay for <HI>returning</HI> to their native country&mdash;&s;o that, upon the whole, unle&s;s each per&s;on, can, well and duly, make up his mind to the <HI>entire</HI> lo&s;s of five-and-twenty-&s;hillings, LAWFUL money of Great Britain, (principal and intere&s;t for ever) I really think he, &s;he, or they, had better &s;tay at home, by which, not only this, but a number of other difficulties travel "is heir to," will be avoided. But, I give warning, there is no other alternative.&mdash;A very long acquaintance with the curious debates which I have heard on
<PB N="5" REF="20">this topic, on both &s;ides of the water, has made me deem it worth <HI>gleaning</HI> thus circum&s;tantially.</P>
<P>So now to the re&s;t of <HI>inevitable</HI> expences. A guinea mu&s;t be given al&s;o to the captain of the packet-boat for the accommodation of a very good bed, and generally, as good behaviour, and one may certainly add, for the comfort of knowing you are under the protection of good &s;ailors, it being no le&s;s remarkable, than true, that, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, the cour&s;e of which is environed with diffi|culties, there has never been a &s;ingle wreck, or accident that threatened it, although their nece&s;&s;ity of braving <HI>all weathers,</HI> with the mail, has expo&s;ed them to every violence of winds and of waves. They are about ninety tons burthen, have a complement of &s;ixteen able|bodied &s;eamen, and are con&s;tructed to an&s;wer the double purpo&s;es of &s;peed and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>In moderate weather, the pa&s;&s;age is about &s;ixteen hours, with a fair wind; if contrary, forty-eight.&mdash;I have, however, many times known it performed from port to port in thir|teen or fourteen. The pacquets can accom|modate twenty-five per&s;ons in the cabin, and &s;tate-rooms; and &s;hould a female wi&s;h, what
<PB N="6" REF="21">delicacy often &s;ugge&s;ts, a place to her&s;elf, the Captain re&s;igns his own room, where &s;he is as much &s;ecluded, from the re&s;t of the company, as if &s;he was in her own apartment. If any per&s;on chu&s;es to appropriate the <HI>whole</HI> cabin, he pays the captain ten guineas, and a &s;ine for every carriage.</P>
<P>Each pa&s;&s;enger takes his own provi&s;ions, with plenty of which the inns, on both &s;ides, are furni&s;hed, and have little ba&s;kets ready to pack them up. But, as the &s;ea u&s;ually takes away the appetite of fre&s;h-water &s;ailors, in the degree that it renders men &s;ea&s;oned to that element voracious, ten &s;icken at the <HI>&s;ight</HI> of that, which the experienced mariner delights to <HI>bebold;</HI> and it is a &s;ettled cu&s;tom, which cannot well be di&s;pen&s;ed with, to leave the ba&s;kets (full or empty) as a little perqui&s;ite to the &s;hip's &s;teward, who (if a pa&s;&s;enger can make u&s;e of them) will provide plates, di&s;hes, gla&s;&s;es, knives, forks, &amp;c. &amp;c. dre&s;s the meat, warm up &s;oup or broth; and if none of the&s;e are wanted, he &s;upplies you with all the little aids that this mi&s;erable &s;ickne&s;s &s;tands in need of; on all which &s;cores, <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t be a churli&s;h pa&s;&s;enger who refu&s;es to leave that recompence which can be of no &s;ervice to
<PB N="7" REF="22">him&s;elf; for who can drag a ba&s;ket of &s;tale victuals to an inn? or carry it on the road? and yet I have not &s;eldom heard hone&s;t <HI>John Bull</HI> quarrel with this cu&s;tom, as
<Q>"More honour'd in the breach, than the ob&s;ervance."</Q> but, as it is only adding the acid of ill-nature to avarice, and after all, as the thing <HI>mu&s;t be done,</HI> I hope this conde&s;cen&s;ion, on my part, to enter into the u&s;eful minutiae will be graci|ou&s;ly received.</P>
<P>If you arrive on the Tue&s;day or Friday at Harwich, which is generally the wi&s;e&s;t way, there is time for all the&s;e little preliminaries; but if you do not&mdash;that is, if you get there on the Wedne&s;day or Saturday, be careful you are not too late. The pacquet &s;ails as &s;oon after the arrival of the mail as po&s;&s;ible, and it is frequently out at &s;ea early in the afternoon of tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>There are porters who take your baggage to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, to pa&s;s the <HI>ceremony</HI> of be|ing in&s;pected; and as one good turn <HI>always</HI> de&s;erves another, it is at a pa&s;&s;enger's option, whether he <HI>choo&s;es</HI> to have his things di&s;placed
<PB N="8" REF="23">or not. The <HI>&s;tipulated</HI> &s;ee for the <HI>examination</HI> is very tri&s;ling&mdash;the compliment for <HI>indulgence</HI> is no object of conte&s;t. One point is certain; the caviller and niggard is &s;ure, in all ca&s;es, to di&s;|appoint his own intentions.</P>
<P>The pacquet lies a little off in the &s;tream, for being rowed to which, including property and per&s;on, you pay one &s;hilling your&s;elf, and &s;ix-pence for each trunk, box, or parcel&mdash;a charge &s;o ab&s;olutely pre-&s;ettled by the com|mi&s;&s;ioner, that, though at the water's edge you were to begin tho&s;e adjurations which continue to your reaching the &s;ide of your ve&s;&s;el (as is often enough the ca&s;e) all you will get for it is, that on board that ve&s;&s;el you <HI>can|not be put</HI> till the uttermo&s;t farthing is paid.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Helveot&s;luice.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FOR my own ea&s;e, as well as your's, I <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e
<Q><L>"The favouring winds,</L>
<L>"Have ki&s;s'd your &s;ails to make your ve&s;&s;el numble;"</L></Q> and that, on your gaining this town, however you may find your&s;elf <HI>&s;ick,</HI> you cannot com|pleat the proverb by being <HI>&s;orry.</HI></P>
<P>Should it be high water, the pacquet will convey you into the center of the town, &s;o that you &s;tep on the quay, and from thence into either of the inns, of which there are &s;everal, but none better, either for treatment or accom|modation, than that of the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> the landlord of which is a &s;on to a captain of one of the packets, which bears the &s;ame name, and which is certainly a very noble ve&s;|&s;el, as indeed they are all&mdash;only, if you will &s;uffer me, for this once, to <HI>pun</HI> on the com|mander's
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Bridge.</NOTE> name, which is "obnoxious to pun|ning," I &s;hould ob&s;erve, that having made
<PB N="11" REF="26">my&s;elf &s;ome pro&s;perous voyages in this Prince of Orange packet, it is but grateful to &s;peak well of the BRIDGE THAT HAS CARRIED ONE WELL OVER, at the &s;ame time it were unju&s;t not to ob&s;erve the re&s;t of the packets are ex|cellent. Remember I di&s;arm your critici&s;m by pleading <HI>guilty</HI> to this pun; but it lay in my path, and I could not <HI>help gleaning</HI> it. If you find it chaff, winnow it from the wheat, and let us go on.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly on your getting on &s;hore, the porters of the place apply to take your baggage to the inn. For each parcel, &s;up|po&s;ing your own &s;ervant does not carry them, you pay, according to the &s;ize, a price &s;tipu|lated by the commi&s;&s;ary, who&s;e printed or &s;igned order they produce in ca&s;e of a di&s;pute. A large trunk is &s;ettled at four
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pence.</NOTE> &s;tivers, a &s;mall one, or portmanteau, at three.</P>
<P>Should you wi&s;h to proceed immediately, without taking any repo&s;e or refre&s;hment; though, by the bye, the environs of this town are very well worth &s;urveying, it will be be&s;t to order your baggage to the com|mi&s;&s;ary's at once, where it will be perfectly
<PB N="12" REF="27">&s;afe, otherwi&s;e you have to pay porterage a &s;econd time, as it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go to the Commi&s;&s;ary's prior to your &s;etting off; the carriage in which you are conveyed being obliged to &s;et off from that officer's door.</P>
<P>There are a few other ceremonies to be at|tended to, before you are in actual progre&s;s. You mu&s;t, if in an hurry to be gone, &s;end to have the bell rung for a waggon; as it is a bu|&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>long half hour,</HI> as they call it here, to a&s;&s;emble the drivers, who ca&s;t lots for the ho|nour of conducting you. The ringing the bell is &s;ix &s;tivers; the charge of the waggon is a commi&s;&s;ary regulation; the compliment to the driver, &s;omething, or nothing, at your option; but, u&s;ually, a &s;kelling, (&s;ixpence) or &s;e&s;thalf (&s;ivepence halfpenny.)</P>
<P>Should the packet arrive <HI>after &s;un&s;et,</HI> there is an additional charge for pa&s;&s;ing the gates, till ten o'clock in Summer, each per&s;on pays a &s;tiver; after which, three guilders, a perqui|&s;ite to the &s;oldiers on guard. As the differ|ence is great you ought to be prepared.</P>
<P>From a perfect knowledge of my good countrymen, who have, for the mo&s;t part,
<PB N="13" REF="28">a &s;ufficient portion of national prejudice, to la&s;t them &s;ome thou&s;ands of miles good tra|velling, I feel it here nece&s;&s;ary, to enter a caveat again&s;t their taking <HI>offence,</HI> at many &s;trange matters they will now meet with. I would, if po&s;&s;ible, <HI>glean the way before them,</HI> by clearing it of all impediments, which may <HI>actually</HI> lie in it, or which are only the work of their own <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> fancies.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, as to the ringing for this <HI>waggon.</HI> A waggon it literally is, though bepainted and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igured all over, &s;o as to "&s;eem the thing it is not." Helveot&s;luice, however, affords no other conveyance either in wet or dry, winter or &s;ummer; and in this conveyance, if you do not walk&mdash;you really <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go in all weathers, &s;ome &s;ix or &s;even miles, generally, at a very flow pace; becau&s;e the roads, except in a very dry &s;ea&s;on of the year, levy &s;uch a heavy tax on your wheels, that neither man or bea&s;t can turn them round fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, a finer opportunity never offered it&s;elf, to try the patience of a mere Engli&s;h|man, who comes from the fine&s;t public roads, and carriages, perhaps, in the whole world, to&mdash; as it will by compari&s;on to him appear&mdash;an

<Q>"Laugh at the whirlwind, and enjoy the &s;torm."</Q></P>
<P>This will not &s;uit the expectations of men, about, perhaps, to make the <HI>grand tour,</HI> and in the habit of running, perhaps, at the rate of
<PB N="15" REF="34">from ten to &s;ixteen miles in the hour. Whereas, in Holland, either by land or water, your movement is <HI>pre-&s;ettled at three;</HI> in&s;omuch, that the di&s;tance from place to place, is mea|&s;ured by &s;o many hours; each hour implying a league.</P>
<P>Tire&s;ome enough <HI>you</HI> will &s;ay!&mdash;unle&s;s you happen to be a <HI>deliberate</HI> traveller, which is, always, ten to one, that a traveller is <HI>not.</HI> Yes, to what end does a per&s;on travel at all: but to &s;ue the DEFFERENCE of manners and cu&s;toms?

Were all things ordered as they are in England, you would have no object of travel.

<P>Among&s;t the <HI>pains</HI> of a re&s;identiary Briti&s;h traveller, are to be reckoned tho&s;e which he derives from being a &s;pectator of the <HI>prejudices</HI>

Does &s;he not add &s;corn and ridicule to tho&s;e impo&s;itions? Can any &s;ingularity in dre&s;s, air, manner, or language, e&s;cape her critici&s;m? and, though, happily, the&s;e outrages on national urbanity are practi&s;ed only by the <HI>mob,</HI> or the giddy and <HI>worthle&s;s</HI> part of the wealthy, they cer|tainly

<P>As a very little candour, and fellow feeling, will rather lighten your baggage than make it heavier; as it will even be a &s;ort of letter of credit, through all the countries you mean to traver&s;e, I &s;trongly advi&s;e you to take a little of it with you; becau&s;e, the omitting to do which, will be attended with two of the wor&s;t con&s;equences, viz. render <HI>you di&s;&s;atisfied with every body, and every body di&s;&s;atisfied with you.</HI> Be &s;ure, therefore, you find room for it, as one of your <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> articles: with which piece of good council, I bid tho&s;e farewell, for who&s;e u&s;e it is intended.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I have got thus far into the &s;tyle of <HI>compagnon de voyage,</HI> (albeit the office of <HI>guide along the dykes,</HI> is not a bad tran&s;lation for this country) I will e'en go <HI>humbly</HI> on, till I have, like an hone&s;t Gleaner, enabled you to pick your way, till you have got a firm footing: for (as a &s;tranger) I mu&s;t con&s;ider you at pre|&s;ent as going over <HI>trembling</HI> ground.</P>
<P>If, after what has been &s;aid, you are neither reconciled to the bad roads, nor wor&s;e vehicles that go over them, your only alternative is walking; which, in Summer, is really plea|&s;ant; and, in all &s;ea&s;ons, is preferable to an healthy per&s;on; as you have a little village at which you can pau&s;e midway, betwixt this town and the Brielle, and go upon a path of powdered cockle-&s;hells, all the way; for the mo&s;t part as firm and well bound, as if it was of Engli&s;h gravel. Should your baggage con|&s;ift of a &s;mall trunk, portmanteau, or travelling
<PB N="19" REF="38">bag, a man may be hired to take it, unle&s;s there be &s;everal in company; in which ca&s;e, the better way will be to have one waggon for the baggage&mdash;clubbing the expence; and all pro|ceed on foot to the Brielle, which is preci&s;ely &s;even Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>That the better&mdash;fairer, at lea&s;t, part of your|&s;elves, (&s;hould you travel with ladies,) may not exclaim at this di&s;tance (though in a party of plea&s;ure, where a woman enters into the true &s;pirit of a ramble, &s;he makes, perhaps, &s;ewer difficulties than men)&mdash;I mu&s;t not forget to tell them, there <HI>is</HI> a &s;ort of thing, fa&s;hioned coach-wi&s;e, covered, at lea&s;t, in which they may go dry, and as Apollo &s;ays in Midas, will have "no bones broke, though &s;orely peppered." When the roads are at their be&s;t, (which is, indeed, the only times the&s;e &s;light machines are to be tru&s;ted; &s;o that when <HI>mo&s;t wanted they are u&s;ele&s;s,</HI>) the novelty, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. renders an experiment in them not unplea&s;ant. They have curtains of leather, but no gla&s;&s;es; are wholly open before, and far from being well &s;hut behind.</P>
<P>Having now got you through the very wor&s;t part of your journey, and gleaned off the di&s;|agreeables
<PB N="20" REF="39">of it, as much as I could; you are to be informed, that there are two ways of your going from the Brielle to any part of the provinces.</P>
<P>There are public boats called &s;chuyts, go every Monday and Wedne&s;day, from the Brielle to Rotterdam. If in a hurry, you may leave your luggage to follow you by tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>And here, let me recommend it to all tho&s;e, who propo&s;e to make a vi&s;it of curio&s;ity, (&s;im|ply to perform the tour of the Provinces and return) to bring over as <HI>little luggage as po&s;&s;ible;</HI> as every trunk, not only co&s;ts nearly as much as a pa&s;&s;enger, but, on account of the almo&s;t con&s;tant tran&s;itions, by land and water, makes it exce&s;&s;ively trouble&s;ome; and the porters are allowed as much for carrying half a &s;core yards as a mile. I will not take upon me to &s;ay, how for Yorick's &s;ix &s;hirts, and provi&s;ion|ary pair of breeches, may an&s;wer to <HI>other</HI> tra|vellers; but, as I am &s;ure, a per&s;on who does not &s;quander his time, may &s;atisfy GENERAL curio&s;ity very &s;peedily; &s;o far as relates to the&s;e Provinces, I &s;hould think a &s;ack or bag made of plu&s;h or carpetting, and lined with leather, known in France by the name of a <HI>&s;ac de nuit,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="40">and very much in u&s;age here, becau&s;e it pays nothing, being con&s;idered as an ab&s;olutely <HI>nece&s;|&s;ary part of the pa&s;&s;enger,</HI> might do extremely well. In Summer, tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to get to Rotterdam the mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly, may hire a waggon, or a waggon-<HI>chai&s;e,</HI> and go to a place oppo&s;ite Rotterdam, where they cro&s;s the ferry, and are there in a &s;hort time: the price is &s;ixteen guilders (from Helvoet&s;luys.)</P>
<P>But, &s;hould they wi&s;h to go at their ea&s;e, and as cheap as po&s;&s;ible, they mu&s;t go in the man|ner before mentioned; fir&s;t to the Brielle. and from thence, at low water, in one of the &s;chuyts, which goes every Monday and Friday; each pa&s;&s;enger only paying thirty &s;tivers, (two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence Engli&s;h,) and a propor|tionate price for their baggage.</P>
<P>Or, &s;hould they not arrive at the Brielle, in time for the <HI>public</HI> &s;ailing days, a <HI>private</HI> boat may be always hired for &s;ix guilders, and &s;ome &s;tivers, and ten people may go in it; but when the &s;chuyt is ordered, always have the precau|tion to take it as for <HI>ten;</HI> becau&s;e, if you &s;ay two or three, and &s;hould afterwards wi&s;h to admit a fourth, he mu&s;t pay &s;ix florins. The
<PB N="22" REF="41">Dutch, you &s;ee, are very <HI>exact</HI> dealers; you mu&s;t, therefore,
<Q>"Speak by the card, or equivocation will undo you."</Q> With a fair wind, you are at Rotterdam in le&s;s than three hours; otherwi&s;e, in about five. But, as there are, in different parts of the year, ob&s;tructions to this mode, &s;uch as high &s;eas, (waters at lea&s;t) ice, &amp;c. &amp;c. and you are &s;till pre&s;&s;ed to proceed; you de&s;ire the landlord of the inn at the Brielle, to take your baggage to the <HI>heads,</HI> from whence you cro&s;s to the ferry|hou&s;e in the i&s;land. When you are <HI>half over</HI> the water in your way to this ferry-hou&s;e, if you do not mean to walk acro&s;s the i&s;land; (the &s;pace exactly of a league) and if your &s;ervant cannot carry your baggage; you reque&s;t the boatman to call a waggon, which is generally got ready by the time you arrive, and for your conveyance in which, if only one per&s;on, you are charged eight &s;tivers; more in proportion to the numbers. Luggage is <HI>always</HI> in this country a &s;eparate article remember.</P>
<P>You will be &s;truck with two awkward no|velties in this bu&s;ine&s;s of cro&s;&s;ing the water. &mdash;The fir&s;t is, that when you direct the boat|man to order, while on the water, a waggon to
<PB N="23" REF="42">go over the i&s;land, he holds up a <HI>mop</HI> as a &s;ig|nal to the waggoner. If <HI>two</HI> waggons are wanted, <HI>two</HI> mops are hoi&s;ted, and &s;o on to any number of per&s;ons in the boat, which will carry over fifty per&s;ons; and all the time he is elevating the&s;e &s;igns, he bawls to the extent of his voice till his breath in&s;i&s;ts upon quarter. I once ventured to &s;ugge&s;t, that a trumpet, or French-horn, giving as many di&s;tinct vollies as might be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the number of waggons wanted, would be a great relief to his own lungs, and to the ears of the company; but this hint was thrown out too much in the &s;pirit of an <HI>impatient</HI> traveller, and before I had thoroughly gleaned the Dutch character, which is in all things uncompliant,
<Q>"Stubborn in wrong, inflexible in right."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;econd <HI>Gaucherie</HI> is, that when the boat has arrived on the other &s;ide, and a fre&s;h freight waits its return, an ugly old hamper is drawn up to a long pole to give notice. I could not help <HI>thinking,</HI> but did not hazard a remark, that a flag, or any other &s;imple article that could be di&s;tingui&s;hed, would have a better look&mdash;but adherence to a cu&s;tom is &s;o <HI>inve|terate</HI> here, that I am per&s;uaded the&s;e mops and ba&s;kets would not have been yielded for
<PB N="24" REF="43">the fine&s;t French-horn in the Prince's band, nor the be&s;t pair of colours in his armies.</P>
<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, you pa&s;s a &s;econd ferry to Mae&s;land&s;luice; I ought previou&s;ly to have told you&mdash;as no circum&s;tance which is conciliatory in this part of your tour (which is certainly the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable) &s;hould be forgotten, that there is a very good po&s;t-coach to be had, which will take four per&s;ons at the ferry-hou&s;e&mdash;if you prefer it to walking, or waggoning it over the i&s;land. At Mae&s;land|&s;luice, (which is a very large, but pretty fi&s;h|ing town,) you will find good accommoda|tions, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> at the <HI>Moreain,</HI> or Black|moor's Head, from whence you can take your route in &s;chuyt, or land carriages, to any part of the provinces.</P>
<P>You may depend upon the following being the exact order for the boats to <HI>Delft,</HI> which is your fir&s;t &s;tage, whether you go to the Hague, Rotterdam, or any other place; and as water|travelling is by far the mo&s;t agreeable and rea|&s;onable mode of making your excur&s;ion, you will probably adopt it. The &s;tatement of this order, therefore, will be very generally u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="44">In Summer, at half pa&s;t five in the morn|ing&mdash;again at eight&mdash;at half pa&s;t eleven&mdash;at two in the afternoon&mdash;at four, and at &s;ix.</P>
<P>In the Winter, at eight, and at twelve&mdash;in the evening, at one, three, and five. The price to each pa&s;&s;enger in the <HI>roof,</HI> as it is called, eight &s;tivers, exclu&s;ive of luggage.</P>
<P>Although I have more to &s;ay of the&s;e Trecht|&s;chuyts hereafter, being indebted to them for &s;ome picture&s;que and characteri&s;tick Gleanings, I will here ob&s;erve, generally, that they are large pa&s;&s;age boats, drawn by one hor&s;e, like our coal, and other common traffick barges.&mdash; They are divided into two compartments, the large&s;t of which, of inferior price, as of infe|rior accommodation, is for all &s;orts of pa&s;&s;en|gers, of which each boat will hold from 50 to 70 per&s;ons, allowing even for the tremendous trowzers of the men, and the prepo&s;terous pet|ticoats of the women. The &s;econd divi&s;ion is appropriate to whoever choo&s;es to pay accord|ingly. It will hold from &s;ix to eight people with ea&s;e&mdash;but as the admi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle Dutchman would fill it with &s;moke (a pipe be|ing always &s;uppo&s;ed welcome, in&s;omuch that <HI>Love me love my pipe</HI> is a Dutch proverb, an|&s;wering
<PB N="26" REF="45">to <HI>Love me love my dog</HI> in our country) it will be always the &s;afe&s;t way to <HI>hire the roof,</HI> that is the whole cabin&mdash;for which you apply to the Commi&s;&s;ary, who lets it to you, if not taken, for an expence well worth incurring, till you are thoroughly <HI>&s;moke-dried</HI>&mdash;which, if you become, as I am, a re&s;identiary traveller, you will &s;oon be, and no more regard a whiff of tobacco &s;hot at you than a &s;ea-breeze. The force of habit is omnipotent; and it was from a thorough know|ledge of its power that Shak&s;peare made Othello &s;ay,
<Q><L>"Cu&s;tom, mo&s;t grave &s;eigneurs,</L>
<L>"Has made my flinty and &s;teel couch of war</L>
<L>"A thrice-driven bed of down.</L></Q></P>
<P>You remember, I dare &s;ay, the &s;tory men|tioned by Dr. Plot, and retailed by the Specta|tor, of an ideot, who chancing to live within &s;ound of a clock, and always amu&s;ing him&s;elf with counting the hour of the day, whenever the clock &s;truck; but this in&s;trument of his en|tertainment being &s;poiled by &s;ome accident, the ideot continued to &s;trike, and count the hour, without the help of it, in the &s;ame man|ner he had done when it was entire. And Bacon ob&s;erves, in his Natural Philo&s;ophy, that our ta&s;te is never better plea&s;ed than with tho&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="46">things, which at fir&s;t created our di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;a re|mark which Mr. Addi&s;on illu&s;trates by inform|ing us, that one of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es this age has produced, (and who had been trained up in all the polite &s;tudies of antiquity), upon his being obliged to &s;earch into &s;everal rolls and records, confe&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an employment was at fir&s;t very dry and irk&s;ome to him, he at la&s;t took an incredible plea&s;ure in it, and preferred it even to the reading of Virgil and Cicero.</P>
<P>Now, though I cannot &s;uppo&s;e this mecha|nical effect can render the violent fumes of to|bacco half &s;o agreeable as a di&s;h of tea or coffee, taken in unob&s;tructed air, were you even to &s;it enveloped in a Dutch boat till you were black|ened and &s;ea&s;oned like a ham upon a hook in a kitchen chimney, I have not a doubt, but a lit|tle time will reconcile you to bear, and &s;carcely to notice, this really univer&s;al practice in Hol|land, and in Germany. Brats of eight or nine years old will take out their pipes with as much formality, and whiff it out in a few minutes. In the great department of the boat, fifty are &s;itting on oppo&s;ite benches, their pipes al|mo&s;t touching each other, and puffing vollies of &s;moke from their mouths and no&s;trils, as if
<PB N="28" REF="47">they were in the mid&s;t of an engagement at clo&s;e quarters. In the coffee-hou&s;es of Rotter|dam, Am&s;terdam, and the other great towns, or cities, where it is cu&s;tomary for the mer|chants to meet before and after change, there are &s;ometimes five hundred &s;mokers at once; amid&s;t the cloudy atmo&s;phere of whom, I, who found it almo&s;t &s;uffocating, a&s;&s;imilated to it &s;o tolerably by the force of habit, that, though I believe I could go through a &s;treet on fire &s;ooner than &s;moke a &s;ingle pipe, I wrote out &s;ome of my plea&s;ante&s;t gleanings in the mid&s;t of the &s;mokers.</P>
<P>Not, however, to run the ri&s;k of being over|whelmed all at once, make your&s;elf ma&s;ter of the roof, if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;and, if not po&s;&s;ible, peradventure a pipe or two &s;hould be levelled at you, think of the ideot and his clock, and the philo&s;opher with his rolls and records.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, think of any thing but &s;uppo&s;ing (whatever be your rank and &s;tation, character, or &s;ex&mdash;a great man, or even a beautiful wo|man) think not, I &s;ay, a true Dutchman&mdash;un|travelled&mdash;will cea&s;e levelling at your eyes and no&s;e till he has &s;hot the contents of his mouth|gun full at you. And then&mdash;thank God!&mdash;yes,
<PB N="29" REF="48">thank God that you are, (by the way your boat has made, &s;ince that <HI>fir&s;t</HI> pipe was &s;moking) &s;o much nearer the end of your &s;tage&mdash;for every &s;moker is &s;upplied with a &s;tove and generally an enormous box of ammunition, and fills and empties with almo&s;t as much dexterity, and more per&s;everance, than a &s;oldier charges and fires.</P>
<P>Not that a Dutchman wants good manners or civility, but that his whole family, and all his connexions, male and female, are &s;o entirely in the habit of this practice, that it never enters into his imagination it can be offen&s;ive to any body el&s;e. Indeed the offer of a pipe is as common a mark of courte&s;y in this country, as the offer of a chair in our's; and, in ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e pre&s;ents it as an in|troduction to ho&s;pitality. You are not, how|ever, to judge from hence, that in the polite hou&s;es this cu&s;tom equally prevails: there are no &s;et of people who conduct an entertainment with more good breeding, if you allow for a few pomps and ceremonies, &s;uch as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention as we pa&s;s on.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we mu&s;t return to our Trecht&s;chuyt, out of the cabin of which, if you are a rapid
<PB N="30" REF="49">traveller, you will, perhaps, think I have de|tained you with matter irrelevant to nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubjects, un&s;ea&s;onably long. Yet this will be a little ungrateful in you too, becau&s;e I have been at &s;ome pains to fortify you again&s;t fire and &s;moke, and arm you, cap-a-pee, for the day of battle; and have, moreover, been a mere <HI>matter of fact gleaner,</HI> intent only in bring|ing you forward, at the lea&s;t charge and incon|venience&mdash;not to lay any &s;tre&s;s on my exam|ples from the Spectator. And to fall out with me by the way, for interweaving a few remarks on cu&s;toms and ideas, that if you do not &s;tay long enough with the natives, you may never know, would be churli&s;h indeed to a guide &s;o friendly.</P>
<P>I have prepared you again&s;t the wor&s;t, but I will rather &s;uppo&s;e you are lucky enough to meet the be&s;t, by hire of the roof, and that you are &s;ole monarch, for the time being, of that &s;nug little apartment, which moves upon the face of the waters, without your being &s;en&s;ible of the motion, permitting you to feel your&s;elf as if in one of your &s;mall parlours, or cabinets, at home: and giving equal freedom to think, read, talk, write, or work, or even repair your dre&s;s, if it is deranged; for this gliding room
<PB N="31" REF="50">which is extremely clean, well fa&s;hed, and cu&s;hioned, is provided with a table, looking|gla&s;s, and every other convenience:&mdash;if you wi&s;h to take wine, you are &s;upplied with gob|lets and gla&s;&s;es&mdash;if tea or coffee, the cups, &s;au|cers, and warm water, like Edwy's Fairy Banquet,
<Q><L>"Come with a wi&s;h,</L>
<L>"And with a wi&s;h retire."</L></Q></P>
<P>This, without all doubt, is, in Summer, the mo&s;t agreeable method of making the tour of the Provinces, as it not only affords you an op|portunity of &s;urveying the mo&s;t beautiful villas, gardens, and plea&s;ure-grounds, (mo&s;t of the&s;e being near the banks of the canals) as, like|wi&s;e of the voluptuous pa&s;tures, and of the fine herds that graze on them; but of &s;taying any number of hours, or days, you choo&s;e in the towns, cities, or villages, that mo&s;t plea&s;e you, with the advantage of quitting one re&s;ting-&s;pot for another almo&s;t every hour of the day.</P>
<P>At entering each town of de&s;tination, your luggage is committed to the care of one of the porter men or women, for the inn, if you de&s;ire to &s;top&mdash;to the Commi&s;&s;ary, &s;hould it be your
<PB N="32" REF="51">de&s;ire to proceed&mdash;and the boat-ma&s;ters have contrived that &s;oon after your arrival at one place, a &s;chuyt is ready to &s;et off for another; &s;o that you are never detained by any wheedling landlord, unle&s;s at your own option. In a word, the pa&s;&s;age boats here form a chain, of which each &s;chuyt is a link, by who&s;e connexion with the re&s;t, you make, with as little trouble as po&s;&s;ible, the circuit of the Provinces.</P>
<P>At Delft, for in&s;tance, where I will now &s;up|po&s;e you landed, there are &s;chuyts, which carry you to Rotterdam, by one canal; to the Hague, by another. That to Rotterdam &s;ets off every hour in the Summer, nearly from &s;umri&s;e, till long after &s;un&s;etting; and in Win|ter from eight in the morning to &s;even o'clock at night; in the roof, the price is eight &s;tivers; in the other part five;&mdash;boxes and trunks, nearly as much as your&s;elf. If your de&s;tination be the Hague, there is a barque goes every half hour in the Summer, and its &s;tarting is an|nounced here, as el&s;ewhere, by the tingling of a bell.</P>
<P>Should your route be Am&s;terdam, and you prefer going, at once, by water, you will find at Delft, a barque that goes every day at three
<PB N="33" REF="52">in the afternoon, during the Summer; and ar|rives at half pa&s;t &s;ix the next morning. In winter&mdash;January and February, at lea&s;t&mdash;they &s;et off only three times in the week, Mondays, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays; returning al&s;o, on the &s;ame days from Am&s;terdam. The&s;e barques are very commodious; take large freights of goods for the trade&s;men; have an excellent cabin, in which are good beds, where you &s;leep as in your own chamber; and the expence is only three guilders three &s;tivers each per|&s;on. If you take the whole roof, which ac|commodates &s;ix per&s;ons and &s;ix beds, fifteen guilders mu&s;t be paid, and fifteen &s;tivers; but, if the captain is not excluded, the price is only twelve guilders twelve &s;tivers; &s;ome|thing more than the u&s;ual charge of a guinea.</P>
<P>Taking with you a ba&s;ket of provi&s;ion, and a bottle or two of wine, this is an excellent way of getting to the capital of Holland, if you can reconcile your&s;elf to pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>night,</HI> &s;ome of the intermediate ornaments and labours of the country. You &s;ave, however, the trouble of pa&s;&s;ing from &s;chuyt to &s;chuyt, and &s;hifting luggage, as by Leyden, Haerlem, &amp;c. but then again, you mi&s;s the &s;urvey of tho&s;e beautiful towns, unle&s;s you take them on your return.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="53">Thus, gentle traveller, having conducted you to Delft, which is a centrical point in the &s;even Provinces, I might con&s;ider the dues of urbanity and compatrioti&s;m fairly performed, and leave you to your&s;elf, wi&s;hing, that what|ever be your tract, &s;atisfaction may be the re&s;ult. But before we part, I have other &s;ervices to render you:&mdash;the fir&s;t of which &s;hall be to &s;et you right, with re&s;pect to the <HI>money</HI> of the country; a ta&s;k which has not yet been ac|curately performed.</P>
<P>This, however, mu&s;t be the object of another letter. The pre&s;ent has carried you over &s;o many difficulties, I think you will readily allow me a re&s;pite; and, po&s;&s;ibly, if you really happen to have encountered them on the day you peru&s;e this advice, you may be glad of a little repo&s;e your&s;elf: for of all kinds of fatigue, that which is attendant on the eager pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, wearies us the mo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>IN the de&s;cription of the different mo|nies u&s;ed in the United States, I propo&s;e as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, to give you an e&s;timate of their value in Engli&s;h currency.</P>

<P><HI>A Doyt.</HI> Is about half a farthing.</P>
<P><HI>A Stiver.</HI> Something more than a penny at <HI>par.</HI> For in&s;tance, twelve &s;tivers are equal to a &s;hilling: at many places, however, they will not give more than ten &s;tivers for a &s;hilling; therefore, the le&s;s a per&s;on brings of &s;ilver coin from England the better.

<P><HI>Dubbeltje.</HI> This &s;ilver coin, of the &s;ame metal, is exactly double the value, and is ex|tremely handy in &s;mall change. I, therefore, recommend the traveller to get about five &s;hil|lings

<P><HI>Five Stiver Piece, or Quarter Guelder.</HI> Of the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion as the guilder; but very rare. You mu&s;t occa&s;ionally, however, meet with it.</P>
<P><HI>A Ze&s;thalven, or five Stivers and four Doyts,</HI> Is a piece of ba&s;e metal, and equal to an Eng|li&s;h &s;ixpence in value. The more of the&s;e you can get the better; becau&s;e the preci&s;e value being known, you can better judge of what you are paying in your little bargains, the &s;ettling which is very embarra&s;&s;ing at fir&s;t.

<P><HI>Six Stiver and one-half Piece.</HI> Is a &s;ilver piece, a little larger than an Engli&s;h &s;ixpence, and the eight part of a rix dolder.</P>

Its cur|rency is univer&s;al; the general value five guilders, five &s;tivers; but being of the pure&s;t gold, is caught at eagerly by the Jews, and not to be got back out of their hands, or even the banker's, without paying them two or three &s;tivers profit on each ducat. But though this appears an impo&s;ition, when you get beyond the Provinces, into Germany, Pru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c. they increa&s;e &s;o much in value, that your general

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL employ this letter on a &s;ubject which can &s;carcely be comprehended under the article <HI>Gleanings,</HI> becau&s;e I do not remember to have &s;een a &s;yllable &s;aid upon it by any touri&s;t, trippi&s;t, or traveller, what&s;oever; though, from experience, I am convinced, as mu&s;t every one who has been on this part of the continent, it is one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and for every &s;tranger to be prepared in. I allude to the &s;imilarity of the Engli&s;h and Dutch languages, and the u&s;e of being &s;upplied with a few que&s;tions and an|&s;wers in the latter for daily exerci&s;e, which, in &s;ome parts of Germany, and even of Hol|land, is as nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;tranger as his daily bread. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to perceive, almo&s;t immediately, not even to <HI>feel</HI> the general re|&s;emblance of the Low Dutch and the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The words, in any language, which a tra|veller picks up, and tries to get a knowledge of, are, of cour&s;e, tho&s;e which enable him to
<PB N="42" REF="61">a&s;k for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and among&s;t the&s;e he will find, when his ear is a little ac|cu&s;tomed to the difference of accent, &s;o great a &s;imilitude betwixt the words which are u&s;ed at home and abroad (I include Germany in this remark) that he will &s;oon under&s;tand the general <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of conver&s;ation among&s;t the na|tives; and if he mixes with them in their or|dinary &s;ocieties a &s;hort time, will be able to take his &s;hare in them. There is, indeed, &s;carce a &s;entence in which the manufacturers of language, whether Dutch or Engli&s;h, have not borrowed from one another. The rights of etymology it is not my place to &s;ettle. Suffice it to ob&s;erve to you, that in taking the circuit of Holland or Germany, an Engli&s;hman mu&s;t return &s;atisfied that there exi&s;ts a very great degree of verbal re&s;emblance.&mdash;Certain words indeed, &s;o approximate, even in pronoun|ciation, e&s;pecially in Freezland, that they have a proverb in that country, which purports,
<Q><L>"Good bread and good chee&s;e,</L>
<L>"Is good Engli&s;h and good freeze;"</L></Q> of which truth, though told in rhyme, I &s;hall, in its place, pre&s;ent you with a plea&s;ant ex|ample.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="62">The re&s;ult of a great deal of ob&s;ervation then is, that &s;uch of my countrymen as po&s;&s;e&s;s a vagrant &s;pirit, and who meditate the tour of Northern Europe, would do well to equip them&s;elves with a few que&s;tion and an&s;wer phrazes, peculiar to the country or province they intend to traver&s;e or to re&s;ide in: for, although a common knowledge of the French language is certainly a very u&s;eful and <HI>general</HI> pa&s;&s;port through all parts of cultivated Europe; and is &s;poken much more among&s;t <HI>all</HI> ranks of people in other countries, than in our's, it is, as I have found, by no means <HI>univer&s;al</HI> enough to guard you again&s;t very uncouth accidents; &s;ince there are <HI>very many</HI> &s;mall, and even great, towns, both in Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, and other parts of Germany, well worth being vi&s;ited, where, if a &s;tranger had not lei&s;ure to go in <HI>&s;earch</HI> of &s;omebody who could &s;peak French, or &s;hould not be fortunate enough to take up his lodging at a public table, <HI>(table d'hote)</HI> he would experience great inconvenience.</P>
<P>In one of the large&s;t and be&s;t inns, for ex|ample, in the circle of We&s;tphalia, even in its capital (Cleves, concerning which, I &s;hall, in due time, expatiate) had I not, during my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> re&s;idence in Holland, picked up a little of
<PB N="44" REF="63">&s;omething <HI>like</HI> Dutch, I might as well have been thrown upon Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe's i&s;land, after it was evacuated. Not a creature in the hou&s;e, filled as it was with &s;ervants, could &s;peak either French or Engli&s;h, and for the fir&s;t day or two after my arrival, notwith&s;tand|ing the little mongrel Dutch with which I was fortified, as neither the ma&s;ter nor his &s;ervants were ingenious enough to make two or three ill pronounced words into an intelli|gible &s;entence (although a Frenchman would have interpreted the wor&s;t French I could have made u&s;e of, and accommodated me at <HI>half</HI> a word) my entertainment was in pantomime, and was amu&s;ing enough, after a few rehear&s;als.</P>
<P>This little extemporaneous drama was &s;up|ported, indeed, by a very few characters, the principal of which were my&s;elf and an hone&s;t Swi&s;s boy, appointed to attend me, and who, really, had all the good-humoured foolery, and whim&s;ical trick of a &s;caramouch. When I wi&s;hed for breakfa&s;t, dinner, or &s;upper, I open|ed my mouth, then &s;hut it, then opened it again, putting my finger backward and for|ward, to imitate the action of eating. When I wi&s;hed for drink, I held up my head, and &s;eemed (gla&s;s in hand) to be pouring its con|tents
<PB N="45" REF="64">down my throat. The Swi&s;s boy incon|tinently did the &s;ame, nodded his head, and went laughing down &s;tairs; very &s;oon &s;hewing he under&s;tood me. Every thing el&s;e that I wanted was expre&s;&s;ed in dumb &s;hew, which &s;o amu&s;ed the Swi&s;s, that I &s;u&s;pect he was much di&s;appointed when this mode of communi|cating broke off. Thus, as I could not "&s;uit the word to the action," I &s;ub&s;tituted the ac|tion <HI>for</HI> the word. We certainly might have gone on in this manner for a twelvemonth, and I &s;hould have been well &s;erved; illu&s;trating all the time the Roman's a&s;&s;ertion, that the three grand principles and powers of oratory con&s;i&s;t in action; but, as Gay's monkey, who was al&s;o a traveller, and had made the grand tour, and was as eloquent on &s;uch occa&s;ions, doubtle&s;s, as either me or my young Swi&s;s, I mu&s;t own I felt my&s;elf rather ambitious to make u&s;e again of that faculty, of which, with all his ingenuity, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed pug is a poor imitator; and, moreover, I mu&s;t re|peat, that my &s;caramouch <HI>would</HI> not un|der&s;tand many expre&s;&s;ions, on purpo&s;e that he might prolong the pantomime.</P>
<P>Some days after, changing my abode to an hotel, where I found a good <HI>table d'hote,</HI> I
<PB N="46" REF="65">amu&s;ed the company with this &s;cene, and an Engli&s;h gentleman pre&s;ent informed me, that in North Holland he was put very often to the like difficulty, &s;moothed only by the like means: to prevent which, in future, he had thought of an expedient, which was; on his return to Am&s;terdam, to form &s;uch que&s;tions and an&s;wers, as were hourly occurring, rela|tive to culinary, chamber, and other dome&s;tic matters, and to get them put not only into good, but to bad Dutch; that is to &s;ay, fir&s;t, as <HI>properly</HI> &s;pelled; &s;econdly, as pro|nounced without any attention to the <HI>&s;pelling;</HI> thereby preparing him&s;elf as well for tho&s;e who could NOT read, as for tho&s;e who <HI>could.</HI> He added, that his bu&s;ine&s;s calling him into &s;e|veral of the &s;ame towns about a fortnight af|ter, he took no guide but his new-made tablets, re&s;olved to try their u&s;e, and went through the very places at which he had be|fore been embarra&s;&s;ed, perfectly at his ea&s;e, creating, by the way, a great deal of harmle&s;s merriment among&s;t the people with whom he communicated, particularly in one family (the ma&s;ter of whom had been churli&s;h in the gentleman's fir&s;t vi&s;it): It was a &s;mall inn, kept by a &s;urly pur&s;e-proud Dutchman, who had &s;aid (rudely, but not without point) if he was
<PB N="47" REF="66">to find <HI>language,</HI> as well as other things, he mu&s;t <HI>charge it in the bill.</HI></P>
<P>The gentleman had not forgot this rapid &s;troke of Dutch traffic, and by way of retalia|tion, determined to go to the man's hou&s;e again, prepared, however, with this fir&s;t que&s;|tion and remark&mdash;<HI>"Will you an&s;wer me now?"</HI> I &s;hall point to what I want of you, without deigning to &s;peak to you, marking the article de&s;ired by very good Dutch. If you do not an&s;wer it immediately, I &s;hall di&s;cover you are as ignorant as you were in&s;olent.</P>
<P><Q>Now it really happened, (&s;aid the gentle|man) that this fellow could neither write or read, upon which I bur&s;t out into a laugh of triumph; and after expo&s;ing him to a good deal of company, who happened to be a&s;|&s;embled, I left his hou&s;e, and was very well under&s;tood in another. I u&s;ually &s;ported my <HI>bad</HI> Dutch, which was generally com|prehended, and where it was not, I pointed to my tablets, in which might be read the good; and am convinced, that by adop|tion of the &s;ame plan, (accommodating my que&s;tions to different languages) I could
<PB N="48" REF="67">make my way through Europe with no actual &s;kill in <HI>any</HI> language but my own.</Q></P>
<P>I was much taken with this devi&s;e, and, al|though I had predetermined to po&s;&s;e&s;s my&s;elf with enough of the language of <HI>every</HI> country through which I meaned to pa&s;s, to expre&s;s my wants and wi&s;hes, and to <HI>&s;top long enough</HI> at a place to render this practicable, (a plan which included a &s;ufficient re&s;idence to <HI>glean,</HI> not <HI>only</HI> a little of language, but a great deal of the manners, and of the cu&s;toms of tho&s;e to whom &s;uch language was natal&mdash;) I deter|mined, likewi&s;e, to follow up this gentleman's plan, by way of <HI>immediate &s;upply.</HI> Accordingly, I put together a number of &s;uch que&s;tions as I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> a&s;k, the replies to which required, in general, nothing more than obedience to the orders they implied, and I found it of &s;uch infinite u&s;e, that I &s;trongly recommend others to do the &s;ame, merely as a <HI>&s;uccedaneum,</HI> till they can make &s;ome progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, I con&s;ider &s;ome knowledge of this kind &s;o e&s;&s;ential to common comfort and ac|commodation, that a traveller &s;hould acquire it, <HI>&s;e defendendo.</HI> He will, otherwi&s;e, find him&s;elf, like a man unarmed in the field of battle, ob|noxious
<PB N="49" REF="68">to every di&s;gui&s;ed and every open at|tack of impo&s;ition, again&s;t an enemy, too, ac|couter'd at all points again&s;t his pocket. The countle&s;s number of guides, tours, journeys, &amp;c. &amp;c. collected, would form (fill at lea&s;t) a library, with which a man cannot po&s;&s;ibly emigrate; and I am really a&s;toni&s;hed, that among&s;t all &s;uch of the&s;e, as have fallen under my in&s;pection, there has not been one traveller who has thought it worth his while to give a &s;ingle dialogue, in common interrogatory and reply, on &s;ubjects that are as nece&s;&s;ary to be a&s;ked, and an&s;wered, as it is to do tho&s;e offices to which they lead, <HI>viz.</HI> eat, drink, and &s;leep. Dialogues of this kind (or rather the que&s;tions and an&s;wers that form a part of them) may, it is true, be found &s;cattered up and down the different grammars, but be&s;ides that the things wanted lie too widely di&s;per&s;ed, it im|plies a nece&s;&s;ity of taking a library with you, and, after that is done, hunting about from page to page for the thing wanted, in&s;tead of having them brought together, clo&s;e under your eye, and within compa&s;s. To have done this, might po&s;&s;ibly deduct from the dignity of a travel writer, but would add importantly to his u&s;e. It &s;eems, however, to be a ta&s;k very
<PB N="50" REF="69">proper for a Gleaner who is re&s;erved
<Q>"to pick up the refu&s;e of tho&s;e <HI>harve&s;t</HI> fields,"</Q> the lofty-minded travellers have gone over with nobler views: namely, to conduct their readers to pictures, palaces, temples, turrets, mountains, and other pieces of magnificence; which, after all, a common <HI>valet de place,</HI> a &s;ixpenny catalogue, or the per&s;ons appointed to &s;hew the&s;e fine &s;ights&mdash;the&s;e &s;uperb <HI>national lions,</HI> would de&s;cribe full as well, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by your own ocular evidence at the &s;ame time. But even the&s;e augu&s;t Journali&s;ts mu&s;t confe&s;s the u&s;e of that information they have di&s;dained to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Conformably, therefore, to the una&s;piring humility of the character I have adopted in this work, I &s;hall, by way of Appendix in the la&s;t volume, before I bring my Gleanings to a <HI>final</HI> clo&s;e, offer a couple of colloquial let|ters, con&s;i&s;ting of Dutch, German, (that is, Low Dutch, High Dutch) and Engli&s;h, con|taining, neither more nor le&s;s than a &s;et (&s;eries) of tho&s;e <HI>orders, que&s;tions,</HI> and <HI>commands,</HI> which every traveller, who is not <HI>immortal,</HI> and I have never heard of any preternatural ones, &s;ince the excur&s;ion of Jupiter and Mercury to
<PB N="51" REF="70">old Baucis and Philemon) mu&s;t give, a&s;k, and receive, every day, and almo&s;t every hour of his life: and I will take care to place them, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, in &s;uch diurnal arrange|ment, beginning with the ri&s;ing, and fini&s;hing with the repo&s;ing hour, that it mu&s;t be a &s;tranger's own fault if he &s;tands in need of the ordinary comforts or conveniencies: becau&s;e, if there is a being in the hou&s;e where he &s;o|journs, who can read, he has but to point to the object de&s;ired, and, if attainable, to get it; or, if he &s;hould meet with a whole family of ignorants, he may follow the <HI>accented</HI> rule of <HI>properly pronounced, but badly &s;pelled,</HI> order, que&s;tion, command, &amp;c. which will be put <HI>immediately below</HI> the &s;ame que&s;tion in its <HI>proper</HI> orthography, and his own ear mu&s;t be very defective if he cannot &s;o expre&s;s him&s;elf, as to be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, which is the &s;ole aim of this very humble endeavour and experiment, the good effect of which I have tried my&s;elf before I recommend it to others. Neither let the erudite critic frown on it. Should it ever be his fortune, to come into tho&s;e parts of the Continent, armed as he may be with all the &s;acred knowledge of the ancient world, and the more refined graces of the modern one (by which, I would be under&s;tood to mean
<PB N="52" REF="71">the polite languages of France and Italy) I am well convinced, even he would relax of his lettered gravity, and not only &s;mile upon, but derive great benefit from this, certainly doggrel and whim&s;ical, mode of <HI>making him&s;elf in|telligible;</HI> &s;ince all the wi&s;dom of the fathers could not effect it half &s;o well. Without, therefore, making any <HI>apologies</HI> (what has been hitherto &s;aid I con&s;ider as nece&s;&s;ary explana|tions) for a good-natured intention, certainly not very amu&s;ing to the writer; I here pro|mi&s;e to execute it (in the be&s;t manner I am able) in its due time and place.</P>
<P>One thing, while it is in my memory, let me warn you about. The common Dutch inn|keepers, porters, boatmen, and that cla&s;s of people, are as great go&s;&s;ips and babillards as any in France, in our own country, or in any other upon the earth, and will talk "about it god|de&s;s, and about it," on the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant occa&s;ions, for an hour together, while minutes might &s;ettle all they can have to &s;ay to, or to do for, you. Never therefore &s;eem to li&s;ten. Fix to your point&mdash;point to your order, or your que&s;tion, or el&s;e pronounce it, and &s;tick there&mdash;hold him to it, as to the one thing needful; and if he flies off into irrelevancies,
<PB N="53" REF="72">bring him back to the point by the aid of the remark I will put into your mouth. This will &s;ave you the hearing "an infinite deal of nothing," and &s;ave <HI>time,</HI> as well as <HI>patience,</HI> for much better u&s;es.</P>
<P>I will at pre&s;ent put an end to this very ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;ubject, with one general remark on the Dutch language, viz. when a per&s;on &s;peaks very bad, broad, and coar&s;e Engli&s;h, it will, for the mo&s;t part, (&s;even words out of ten) be good, pure Dutch. But, of this, the pronunciations I mean to &s;et down for you will &s;ufficiently con|vince you. And were the natives to &s;peak &s;low, (every language to a per&s;on ignorant of it <HI>&s;eems to be &s;poken fa&s;t</HI>) an Engli&s;hman, though he might be at fault as to particular words, would be <HI>au fait</HI> as to the general topic, and the turn it was taking; which reminds me that you will derive a double advantage from my little vocabulary:&mdash;while you are trying to make out meanings by <HI>fal&s;e</HI> orthography, you will in&s;en&s;ibly get into the <HI>true;</HI> and thus accom|modate the wants of the pre&s;ent and future: with which encouraging hint we will relea&s;e one another from this &s;chool-boy's exerci&s;e, and get to &s;omething more entertaining to us both: for you cannot &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e &s;chool|ma&s;ter
<PB N="54" REF="73">le&s;&s;ons have been very delightful to their author. What I promi&s;e in an appendix &s;hall &s;erve as a pocket companion re&s;pecting &s;ome points nece&s;&s;ary to be immediately known to the traveller: it may be all-&s;ufficient to &s;uch purpo&s;e&mdash;which a&s;&s;uredly has not been effected by any guide, trip, or four hitherto made pub|lic. I propo&s;e to annex it to my Gleanings.</P>
<P>And now, courteous &s;tranger, the Seven Provinces are, <Q>all before you which to choo&s;e.</Q> In the&s;e primary pages you will find the needful for your &s;afe guidance. Sup|po&s;ing this and the two promi&s;ed, que&s;tion and an&s;wer, dialogues to become a <HI>&s;eparate &s;heaf</HI> from my general Gleanings, I am here to bid you farewell. On the contrary, if you de&s;ire to &s;ee objects, and read of circum&s;tances, as they &s;truck me, in a &s;urvey of them at different times and &s;ea&s;ons, (among&s;t which, I tru&s;t, many will be not unplea&s;ant, and, not a few, u&s;eful, particularly if you pa&s;s beyond the li|mits of the republick, into other countries) we &s;hall &s;till, in a manner, be conver&s;ing together, and the whole of my Gleanings will be a part of your company. In this ca&s;e, I repeat, we &s;hall &s;till <HI>travel together.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="74">But, at all events, from YOU, my friend, and <HI>your</HI> dear circle, whom I more <HI>particularly</HI> addre&s;s, and from whom, if I &s;eem to deviate a little to admoni&s;h others, it is but in imita|tion and adoption of that bounty, which has in|duced you &s;o often of late to tell me our cor|re&s;pondence, by being occa&s;ionally broadened in its application, may become more exten&s;ively u&s;eful and amu&s;ing. From you and your's, I &s;ay, I am &s;ure of finding a hearty good will, let me wander about with you where I li&s;t, and &s;hift the &s;cene upon you as irregularly, and rapidly, (taking you backwards and forwards) as I think proper. Under &s;uch encourage|ments, we will now take a trip to the Hague, which, indeed, I have already thrice vi&s;ited, &s;ince my quitting that fire-&s;ide, where I have always found "a ready chair," and, &s;o long as circum&s;tances permitted, a delightful home. "May eternal ble&s;&s;ings crown" the owners of it!&mdash;a prayer of &s;uch "earne&s;t heart," that I will not &s;uffer it to be "mixed with ba&s;er matter."&mdash;Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Hague.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT the fir&s;t blu&s;h, the following fact, my dear loved friend, may &s;eem &s;trange. There is far more diligence of attention required of a Gleaner, to pick up any thing worth carrying to his &s;heaf in great and populous towns and cities, than in the undi&s;tingui&s;hed villages, and "&s;till &s;mall" rece&s;&s;es, where the broad and common <HI>highway, thoroughfare, traveller</HI> &s;eldom goes; and where, though the violet perfumes the air, and the fre&s;h gra&s;s &s;prings up in the beautiful paths, tho&s;e "gari&s;h beauties of the world" are wanting, that are alone gratifying to a heart devoted to the publick. For al|though, in this latter &s;cene, every thing is in motion before you, or &s;tanding fixed, in proud but mute magnificence, for your in&s;pection&mdash; as if almo&s;t to in&s;i&s;t on your pa&s;&s;ing homage; they have yielded up their charms to &s;o many &s;trangers, that, like one of our fair drudges of fa&s;hion, who&s;e face has been &s;o long in pub|lick
<PB N="57" REF="76">exhibition, it is become "familiar as one's garter;" and to give <HI>another</HI> de&s;cription of it would be to <HI>force</HI> on you what memory would perhaps turn from with di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Ah! my friend, what honours&mdash;what mines of wealth would roll into the coffers of the man, who, when the objects of this variable life have lo&s;t their wonted power of giving plea&s;ure, but, by change of circum&s;tances, have acquired, unexpectedly, the power of giving pain&mdash;what, of riches and fame, I &s;ay, would <HI>he</HI> de&s;erve, who could command our once-dear, but now &s;lighted, objects, to quit tho&s;e cells in the brain, where they have not only,
<Q>"A local habitation, and a name,"</Q> but a fixed lodging&mdash;and&mdash;(bitterly again&s;t our will) are become tenants for life therein? We &s;ee, we admire, we love, we po&s;&s;e&s;s: our fe|licity &s;eems entire. Alas! an idea, an opi|nion, a di&s;pute, the &s;atisfying power of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, the frequency of &s;eeing, of en|joying, a new fancy, a new object, fir&s;t dimi|ni&s;hes, and, at la&s;t, de&s;troys, the eager delight with which we beheld our fine&s;t parks, gardens, pictures, and all our earthly paradi&s;es, as ima|gination,
<PB N="58" REF="77">in her fine&s;t ardours, is wont to call them.</P>
<P>The&s;e, neverthele&s;s, remain the &s;ame; the verdure is as refre&s;hing, the flowers as &s;weet; the hand of time, mellowing the tints, has even thrown new graces on the canva&s;s&mdash;and yet we are weary of them. What fault can they have committed? "What committed?" The greate&s;t. They are our own, and they have "outlived our liking."</P>
<P>Shall I a&s;cend from inanimate objects, to &s;uch as have life? to &s;uch as bound them&s;elves even like a charm round our necks&mdash;round our hearts&mdash;but which <HI>now</HI> (perhaps more truly filled with enchantment to all the world be|&s;ides) are nothing to us, or wor&s;e than nothing, a mill-&s;tone round our necks&mdash;a galling chain round our feet? He who could make us, at the word of command, forget even the&s;e, or rather the keen rebuke with which con&s;cience employs memory, over whom &s;he has control, to puni&s;h our frivolous and in&s;atiable incon|&s;tancy&mdash;what would we not offer him?</P>

So that, every way, I take it for granted, you have had, or will have, more than enough of intelligence touching the&s;e o&s;ten&s;ible objects.</P>
<P>My intention is, and has all along been, to mention, to you, from every place tho&s;e, things, which it is mo&s;t likely, neither your fixture, nor your walking guides, will ever think of &s;hewing you; or if &s;ome of them are &s;et down in the books, you mu&s;t lo&s;e a greater propor|tion of time in hunting them up, through the hiding places of &s;everal hundred pages, about <HI>le plus beau, et la plus belle</HI> (the nau&s;ea of every panegyric.
<Q>"Where pure de&s;cription holds the place of &s;en&s;e.")</Q> before you can get at them; like a &s;quirrel running through a wilderne&s;s for a kernel, when
<PB N="65" REF="84">there is &s;carcely a nut tree in an acre of ground. Now having done all this my&s;elf, I am willing to &s;pare you the trouble; for which courte&s;y I have only to de&s;ire, that in imitation of the abovenamed ingenious and plea&s;ant little ani|mal, when I lay before you any literary nut, which has not an&s;wered to you the pains of cracking, throw it a&s;ide, and depend on the next; or peradventure, the next after that, be|ing more to your ta&s;te; and remember, too, that even that which di&s;plea&s;ed you, and which you condemned as in&s;ipid, may exactly &s;uit the palate of whoever picks it up after you, and think it even a <HI>bonne bouche</HI> gleaning.</P>
<P>I have one general remark to make upon all the books, in the way of guides, which have ever fallen under my examination; and I have had the fortitude, in all countries, to &s;truggle through all &s;orts and &s;izes. You will note, that I &s;peak only of &s;uch as are written by the na|tives, or foreigners re&s;ident, or rather e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; till they are, as it were, naturalized&mdash; to the place they de&s;cribe.&mdash;Their accounts of kings, queens, palaces, theatres, churches, charity hou&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c. walks, and public entertainments are, doubtle&s;s, for the mo&s;t part, ju&s;t; as may be tho&s;e of laws, govern|ment,
<PB N="66" REF="85">police, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;As far as it goes, this intelligence is &s;atisfactory; and the le&s;s it is clogged with remark, or encumbered with &s;entiment, the better; but a very great num|ber of tho&s;e objects mo&s;t intere&s;ting to a &s;tranger, they totally pa&s;s over; and a&s;&s;uredly for a good, and (to them) &s;ufficient, rea&s;on; becau&s;e, they cannot &s;uppo&s;e the manners, cu&s;toms, and peculiarities which &s;trike travel|lers, <HI>can</HI> be intere&s;ting; &s;ince, being among&s;t the mo&s;t ordinary occurrences; in the mid&s;t of which they were born, they cannot even imagine them to be &s;ingular.</P>
<Q>"What can we rea&s;on but from what we know."</Q>
<P>And as &s;uch authors &s;eldom leave their own country; the very articles which di&s;criminate that from every other, they mu&s;t be in total ignorance of.&mdash;This reflection is &s;o exten&s;ively true, that I will venture to &s;ay, there is &s;carcely a book written by a native hi&s;torian of the Hague, or of other towns, who has noticed any one of tho&s;e peculiarities, that would fa&s;ten <HI>principally</HI> on an Engli&s;h traveller's ob&s;ervation; &s;uppo&s;ing him not to be inveterately attached to brick and mortar. For in&s;tance, a Dutch author would&mdash;all commercial as is his coun|try&mdash;never think of telling you that the very
<PB N="67" REF="86"><HI>dogs of Holland,</HI> are con&s;trained to promote the trade of the Republic; in&s;omuch, that &s;ave the Great Dogs of fa&s;hion and &s;tate, which run before or after their lords and ladies equipages; and, in imitation often of their betters, are above being of any u&s;e; there is not an <HI>idle</HI> dog of any &s;ize in the &s;even Provinces. You &s;ee them in harne&s;s, at all parts of the Hague, and &s;ome other towns, tugging at barrows, and little carts, with their tongues almo&s;t &s;weeping the ground, and their poor hearts almo&s;t ready to beat through their &s;ides. Frequently three, four, five, and &s;ometimes &s;ix abrea&s;t, carrying men and merchandi&s;e, with the &s;peed of little hor&s;es. And in your walk from the Hague Gate to Scheveling, (where we will pre&s;ently make an excur&s;ion,) you encounter, at all hours of the day, an incredible number loaded with fi&s;h <HI>and</HI> men, under the burden of which, they run off at a long trot, and &s;ometimes (when driven by young men, or boys) at full gallop, the whole mile and an half, which is the di&s;tance from gate to gate; nor, on their return, are they &s;uffered to come empty, being filled not only with the afore&s;aid men or boys, (for almo&s;t every Dutchman hates walking when he can ride, though half a mile); but with &s;uch commodities as cannot be had at the
<PB N="68" REF="87">village.&mdash;I have &s;een the&s;e poor brutes, in the middle of &s;ummer, urged beyond their force, 'till they have dropped on the road to gather &s;trength; which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, however, except when they have the misfor|tune to fall under the management of boys; for the Dutch are the farthe&s;t from being cruel to their dome&s;tic, dumb animals, of any peo|ple in the world; on the contrary, an Hol|lander, of whatever rank, is &s;o merciful unto his bea&s;t; whether hor&s;e, dog, cow, &amp;c. that they are the objects of his marked attention, as &s;leek &s;kins, happy faces, and plump &s;ides, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate. The cows, and oxen for draft, they rub down; curry, and clean till they are as glo&s;&s;y as the mo&s;t pampered &s;teed in England. Nay, you frequently &s;ee them with a light fancy dre&s;s, to guard them from the flies, and other annoying animalcula, in the meadows, which are the fine&s;t in the world, and in a warmer &s;uit of cloaths during the winter; even the&s;e canine &s;laves look hale and well, as to condition, and being habituated to labour, feel little hard&s;hip in it. Happy, however, thrice happy, is the dog, who has the luck to be born of humbler and lowly parents, and is &s;acred, by his in&s;ignificance, from labour. Like many a man, who, having nei|ther
<PB N="69" REF="88">talents nor &s;ize for a hero, derives many a &s;nug enjoyment from his unfitne&s;s to take an active part in the toils of ambition. But dogs of this de&s;cription, have yet greater privileges in Holland, than you may imagine. Like other <HI>little</HI> things, they are held precious, and &s;o fondled and patted, that either a lapdog, or a lover in England, where tho&s;e animals, you know, are &s;ometimes neglected, as, indeed, in that country, are all favourites, might envy them; for if you think a Dutch woman, and a beautiful woman, are incompatible, you are mi&s;taken, as I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to &s;hew.</P>
<P>In my fir&s;t vi&s;it (a winter one) to the Hague, I entered into the intere&s;ts of the&s;e poor day-labouring dogs &s;o truly, that I wondered they did not go mad, or that I did not hear of the canine di&s;traction more in this country, than in ours; and on being told there were certain times (the dog days) when a heavy fine was to be paid upon any dog being &s;een in the &s;treet, I &s;uppo&s;ed this <HI>was</HI> the ca&s;e, till the &s;ummer following, being at this delightful &s;ea|&s;ide village of Scheveling, I ob&s;erved, &s;everal times in the day, the&s;e draft dogs, brought down to the beach, and bathed; a practice;
<PB N="70" REF="89">which no doubt equally prevented them from this dreadful di&s;order before-mentioned, and gave them &s;trength to go through their work.</P>
<P>It is fortunate, al&s;o, that Holland is a country &s;omewhat prone to be &s;trict in the ceremonies of religion, by ob&s;ervance of which the dogs, like their ma&s;ters, find the &s;eventh a day of unbroken re&s;t: for "Sunday &s;hines a Sabbath day to them." The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion (which is allowed a grand point, you know) being much in favour of the&s;e indu&s;trious creatures, I had an eye on them, as well in the hours of their repo&s;e, as toil; and felt my heart warm to &s;ee &s;everal, whom I had ob&s;erved very heavily laden on the Saturday, taking a &s;ound nap, out &s;tretched and happy at their ma&s;ters doors, on the day in which their lei&s;ure is even an al|lotment and bounty of heaven. All the morn|ing and afternoon, they have remained, ba&s;king in the &s;un, or in the &s;hade, in profound tran|quillity, while a number of unthinking whelps, and lazy puppies, who had been pa&s;&s;ing their time in idlene&s;s all the week, were playing their gambols in the &s;treet, not without a vain at|tempt to wake the &s;eniors, and make them join in their amu&s;ement. Towards evening, I have,
<PB N="71" REF="90">in my &s;un&s;etting rounds, been much plea&s;ed to notice the hone&s;t creatures, &s;it at their re|&s;pective thre&s;holds, looking quite refre&s;hed, giving occa&s;ionally into a momentary frolic, and the next morning returning to the labours of the week ab&s;olutely renewed.</P>
<P>Reader&mdash;Stranger&mdash;art thou too proud of heart&mdash;or too full of the dignity of human nature&mdash;to enter into the&s;e brute concerns? Pa&s;s on then, and pity my weakne&s;s, but not without remembering that

<L>"Ne'er fawn on any that they love not;</L>
<L>"And, I'm a friend to dogs. They</L>
<L>"Ne'er betray their ma&s;ters."</L></Q> If therefore thou ha&s;t no feeling for their &s;ufferings, re&s;pect at lea&s;t their virtues:

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have thus ha&s;tily, and almo&s;t im|perceptibly, run with you out of the Hague, and got into the environs, indeed, into one of the mo&s;t ju&s;tly celebrated parts of them, (the Scheveling-Road)&mdash;let us e'en take our way to that village before we return.</P>
<P>I have already called this walk beautiful. It is &s;o in a very high degree, indeed: and has not, by the mo&s;t lavi&s;h de&s;cribers, been over-prai&s;ed. The plan of this walk, is &s;aid to have been laid by Con&s;tantine Huygens, in 1653. Its length from the Banicre, to the entrance of Scheveling, is computed at 590 fathom; from the bridge at the Hague, to the Scheveling beach it is 916.&mdash;Its breadth is 18 fathom. It is divided into three <HI>obvious</HI> paths, and two concealed:&mdash;Of the former, a &s;pacious one in the middle is for carriages; one on the right &s;ide for hor&s;es of plea&s;ure; and one on the left for foot pa&s;&s;engers. The whole are in a &s;traight line; &s;o that the center path &s;hews you, on entrance of the avenue, at exactly half a league's di&s;tance, the &s;pire of Scheveling
<PB N="74" REF="93">church; forming a vi&s;ta; and the extreme end, on either &s;ide, forms an opening, Gothic-fa&s;hion, not unlike the entrance of an hermitage, the effect of which (a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the frequent gloom of the &s;urrounding trees, which form a canopy all the way) is very &s;triking.</P>
<P>Of this &s;oliage, as, indeed, of all other in Holland, the Republic is with good rea&s;on, extremely jealous. Con&s;ider, but the time and labour nece&s;&s;ary to procure it, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, and you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, when I tell you that, as you pa&s;s along their "allies green," you will ob&s;erve idle boys, and others, corrected in effigie, or in paintings, and &s;tuck up in <HI>terrorem,</HI> to warn them of the penalties attendant on the lea&s;t depredation of this con|&s;ecrated verdure.</P>
<P>You are told, with great truth, by the guides, that every body comes to &s;ee this walk.&mdash;It is plea&s;ant at all times of the year; becau&s;e it is a defence equally from the &s;ummer's &s;un, and the winter's &s;torm. You pay a farthing for en|tering, and a farthing for returning, and un|le&s;s you have a &s;ettled antipathy to &s;cenes of this kind, would think your money advantage|ou&s;ly laid out, had it been ten times the &s;um. On the working days, it is little frequented ex|cept
<PB N="75" REF="94">by the fi&s;hwomen, who run through it in &s;hoals, with turbot, cod, &s;oles, and &s;hrimps, all the morning, &s;ome hundreds together; their heads loaded enough to break their necks; and returning after market hours, loaded with other things&mdash;wood, groceries, hardware, vegeta|bles, and other little nece&s;&s;aries, which they have taken in barter, or purcha&s;ed out of their profits; not unfrequently hand in hand, or arm in arm, half a dozen at a time, &s;inging <HI>out</HI> of tune, but perfectly <HI>in</HI> temper, with fi&s;h-looking forms, and &s;ea-bright countenances. "It is a recreation to be by," and hear their artle&s;s merriment, &s;peaking to every body they encounter, which is a very general fa&s;hion in Holland; a good-morrow, a good-night, and a bow, or a curt&s;ey, you get from every body; &s;ometimes, even to tediou&s;ne&s;s, of which here|after. The pa&s;&s;ing of the&s;e people along the different allies, a&s;&s;i&s;ts the beauty of the per|&s;pective; blended too, as it is, towards the evenings, with the gentry and burghers of the Hague; and on a fine Sunday, it is truly a Dutch Jubilee. The throng is prodigious.&mdash; The picture&s;que &s;ingularity of the dre&s;&s;es, the huge hats of the pea&s;ant women, projecting li|terally more than a yard from their heads; their enormous earings dropping on their &s;houlders;
<PB N="76" REF="95">fi&s;hermen loaded with &s;ilver buttons, each larger than a crown piece; a felt bonnet on his head, a pipe in every mouth&mdash;the people of fa&s;hion in carriages, three or four deep, to the extent of the walk; the carts and waggons of the country people, full almo&s;t to overflowing, all in motion at once, under the umbrage of the fine&s;t oaks, limes, and beech trees I ever &s;aw; all this cannot be an unintere&s;ting picture to the mo&s;t ill-tempered per&s;on breathing.&mdash; To a good natured one&mdash;to you, my friend, it would be&mdash;
<Q>"A fea&s;t of rea&s;on, and a flow of &s;oul."</Q></P>
<P>You would &s;ee, though in a &s;tranger's land, the beauty of vegetation: you would &s;ee human felicity pourtrayed in a thou&s;and, good, round, unthinking faces, and to u&s;e the words of poor, dear, Gold&s;mith, you would
<Q>"Gather bli&s;s to &s;ee your fellows ble&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I have mentioned &s;inging&mdash;It is almo&s;t the con&s;tant practice of the lower &s;ort of people in Holland.

<P>I mu&s;t own, my dear friend, I am of the &s;ame opinion. The Dutch phlegm &s;peaking of it as a characteri&s;tic, I con|ceive to exi&s;t, rather in their exterior than interior, moins dans leur &s;ang &amp; dans leur phy&s;ique que dans leurs moeurs et dans leurs mani&egrave;res. Why are the per&s;ons of condition in this country more light, ea&s;y, and unre&s;trained, than tho&s;e who have not relieved the bu&s;y cares of commerce by the refining blandi&s;hments of &s;ociety? Why do we ob&s;erve the children here as lively, alert, trickful, and plea&s;antly mi&s;chievous, as in England or France! I have &s;een the little &s;eminaries of learn|ing emptied on a holiday, every hour of which has been de|voted to as active joys as if they were the "playful children ju&s;t let loo&s;e" from the &s;chools of Great Britain: like tho&s;e, I have &s;tood with a rapture, that rolled back upon my memory the days of youth, to &s;ee them illu&s;trate all the delicious imagery of that Great Britain's Pindar, who fills the mind with plea&s;ure at a fiftieth reading. The little Hollanders have brought un|der my eye all that ever he could have ob&s;erved among&s;t the youths of Eton:
<Q><L>"While &s;ome on earne&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s bent,</L>
<L>"Their murmuring labours ply</L>

<L>"They heard a voice in every wind,</L>

<P>I &s;peak of well-educated youth. Why I &s;ay are the&s;e &s;o different from the children of pea&s;ants or trade's people? Is it not as the French would expre&s;s it, <Q>que les uns &s;ont eleves dans des mai&s;ons ou toute re&s;pire une joye aimable, une libert&eacute; d&eacute;cente, et que les autres ne voyent, chez eux, qu'une gravit&eacute; froide et taciturne, qui pa&s;&s;e pour une pru|dente &s;age&s;&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Ah! how often have I had rea&s;on to deplore the want of candour in the e&s;timate which one nation makes of another! a want which is not compen&s;ated by either talents or virtues. In effect, candour is but another name for charity, without which a character, though it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every other quality, is deficient. De&s;titute of this, another, its oppo&s;ite (Detraction) paints every thing in di&s;temper. It is in the &s;pirit of this malign principle, we are told, that the courage of a Dutchman is nothing but patience, his intrepidity phlegm, his per&s;eve|rance ob&s;tinacy, his &s;implicity of manners, a tenacity of his own &s;entiments&mdash;his indu&s;try, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and his wealth, the fruit of his avarice. Surely nothing more amiable than national want of candour, infecting even men of &s;cience, could induce &s;everal re&s;pectable authors of our own country, to hazard what follows:</P>
<P>The cardinal virtue of an Hollander, &s;ays one of them, is <HI>prepret&eacute;,</HI> his only divinities Mercury and Plutus; but as for Apollo, and his nine mu&s;es, they never heard even of their names: antiquity is a thing held in utter contempt by them, and if an arti&s;t &s;hould dare to copy the ancient ma&s;ters with a &s;ublime and emulative p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cil, he would die of hunger. I have &s;een in France, idle, wicked, fallacious men, as in England, or el&s;ewhere; but for Holland, how &s;hall I find a national charac|ter, &s;ince an individual cannot be &s;aid to give it; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have &s;een <HI>one</HI> amiable Dutchman.</P>
<P>The travels of the author (Martin Sherlock,) are not among&s;t the volumes of my portable library; I may, therefore, forget the expre&s;&s;ion; but I grieve to remember, that this is the &s;en&s;e. I grieve, becau&s;e I value the author, and have long loved the man, whom I know to be as worthy as ingenious, but he was a <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> traveller, and I am per&s;uaded would have given a truer de&s;cription, had he been, like me, a deliberate Gleaner.</P>
<P>But a whole &s;ociety of literary men have offended again&s;t truth and candour in the &s;ame way, and again&s;t the &s;ame peo|ple. No le&s;s than the authors of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, have a&s;&s;ured us, that the Dutch are cold, phlegmatic, brutal, and without invention. They per&s;i&s;t indefatigably in every thing they begin, and fini&s;h the mo&s;t laborious, painful undertaking, without a &s;hadow of ta&s;te, freedom, reflection, or fore&s;ight. A dull, &s;ordid, kind of patience, have enabled them to make &s;ome &s;mall progre&s;s in arts and &s;ciences. Holland, it mu&s;t be owned, has produced poets, painters and &s;culptors; but it ap|pears to have been contrary to the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, like vines in Siberia; and, like comets, appear once in an age, by way of phaenomina. In general, whatever appears to have pa&s;&s;ion, or emotion, is dead among&s;t them; the pa&s;&s;ion for gain alone excepted. We never hear of a quarrel, but when the effect of drunkenne&s;s; and how &s;hall we hear of jealou&s;y in a nation that never yet felt the power of love? Gluttony and in&s;en&s;ibility, were the epithets which the ancients gave to the old Batavians: their de&s;cendents are not le&s;s known among&s;t the moderns, by their apathy, &s;tupidity, and phlegm. The reader, may form his judgment of this people, by a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation of Sir William Temple, who recounts the hi&s;tory of a man, who &s;pent twenty-four years in making a globe; and thirty to inlay a table. I tru&s;t, you will find them honourably re&s;cued from the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions; for a&s;per&s;ions they are&mdash;in the cour&s;e of the&s;e Gleanings &s;acred to candour and to you, which is another name to expre&s;s the &s;ame thing.</P></NOTE> &s;inging &s;ort of people.</P>

Moreover, the whole figure of the groupe is &s;omewhat unweildy, and the fi&s;her|men in their boat-dre&s;&s;es, and in glee, like bears rampant; and though I have &s;een them pa&s;s fifty times in full chorus along the delicious avenues afore&s;aid, I mu&s;t own, I ne|ver beheld any Orphean miracle likely to re&s;ult from the utmo&s;t exertion of their vocal powers. Not a tree walked after them; not even a &s;hrub bowed its head towards them, except when moved by the magic of the wind. But I &s;aw, as ob&s;erved already, what you would like much better to &s;ee&mdash;a great number of
<PB N="82" REF="101">hard-working human beings, extremely charm|ed with them&s;elves, and with each other. Ah! are there not in the higher walks of life, many refined and elegant a&s;&s;emblies of men and women, the equals of the&s;e humble child|ren of nature&mdash;perhaps the &s;uperiors, in point of number, but mi&s;erably their inferiors in health, inoffen&s;ivene&s;s, and joy?</P>
<P>The waggons, in which they go tho&s;e excur|&s;ions, are the &s;ame as tho&s;e in which their ge|neral bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on, and u&s;ually have &s;ome quaint devices painted behind, on a board that fa&s;tens them, at the bottom of which is frequently a line, couplet, or &s;tanza, "&s;pelled by the unlettered mu&s;e," &s;acred to Toil and Plea&s;ure. But the burghers and &s;ervants of the Hague, a little town-&s;truck, commonly club for a &s;ort of chai&s;e, which will hold about a dozen on three &s;eats, and thus they come &s;ing|ing down to Scheveling "as merry as the day is long!"</P>
<P>But you are prepared to take a view of all the&s;e different &s;orts of people on the beach. There, however, you would not &s;ee them, were you to be fixed in front of it, like one of the hou&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ing that hou&s;e animated, and
<PB N="83" REF="102">every window of it an eye, which by the bye would make it an Argus; for the Dutch, not paying (upon earth for the light of heaven) any &s;uch tax as our's, the hou&s;e is bewindowed from top to bottom.</P>
<P>Strange as it may &s;eem, it is the Dutch cu&s;|tom to drive from the Hague, and other parts of Holland to the Beach Head, there &s;top a little, and drive back again. Nay, tho&s;e va|letudinarians (Dutch I mean) who take an airing to the &s;ea-&s;ide for health, do ju&s;t the &s;ame, with the additional &s;ingularity of re|maining in the carriages, the gla&s;&s;es drawn down, then clo&s;ed; then half opened, for about an hour&mdash;but I do a&s;&s;ure you, out of more than a thou&s;and different vehicles, which I have &s;een, from the apartment I occupied, pa&s;s to the Beach Head, I never ob&s;erved a &s;ingle carriage, but the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador's go upon the &s;ands, though they extend a league at low water to right and left, as firmly bound as a gravel walk in a garden, and as level as a bowling green.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to let &s;uch a phenomenon of &s;ingularity, as it appeared to me, e&s;cape ungleaned. On enquiry, I was told, and on
<PB N="84" REF="103">the be&s;t authority, that of three different me|dical gentlemen, that one of the favourite and almo&s;t univer&s;al opinions of Great Britain, is totally &s;couted in Holland, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;alubrity of the &s;ea air, or water.&mdash;The Dutch, almo&s;t to a man, nay to a Doctor, contend, that it is the mo&s;t "pe&s;tilent congregation of vapours" a man can po&s;&s;ibly breathe, that it is &s;it only for a mad dog. And one of their guide|writers very &s;eriou&s;ly tells you, in a book of 340 pages, about the Hague only, that <Q>very fortunately the &s;outhern a&s;pect is &s;kreened by a chain of &s;andy mountains, and inter|mediate meadows, which <HI>protects</HI> the beauti|ful Hague from the <HI>malign exhalations of the</HI> &s;ea</Q> And in another place he a&s;&s;ures his readers, that <Q>the air of the Hague is pure and whole&s;ome&mdash;<HI>malgr&eacute; la proximit&eacute; de la Mer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, without pretending to enter the li&s;ts of medical controver&s;y with the&s;e learned gentlemen, if it could po&s;&s;ibly have been done, without getting into a di&s;qui&s;ition (which on all &s;ubjects is my dread, becau&s;e it u&s;ually tends only to "words, words, words," as Ham|let &s;ays) I &s;hould have been glad to a&s;k them, to what the &s;uperior health of the inhabitants
<PB N="85" REF="104">of the Hague, the Brielle, and other Dutch towns in the neighbourhood of the &s;ea, is to be attributed, <HI>but to this very circum&s;tance?</HI> Yet the whole nation have &s;et their faces again&s;t it, in my opinion, very ungratefully; &s;o I &s;hall not attempt vindicating what they are &s;o &s;tur|dily bent upon con&s;idering as an enemy&mdash; though con&s;idering both their trade and their &s;ituation, the ocean is &s;carcely more a friend to one of its own fi&s;hes, than to a Dutchman:
<Q>"Who &s;hall decide when doctors di&s;agree?"</Q></P>

Pray what may this be for? They con&s;ider air, as well as water, unwhole&s;ome, and the &s;un, for&s;ooth, is unfriendly to furni|ture.

<P>But to e&s;cape from the&s;e Dutch wags, and conver&s;e with you my friend&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="109"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following anecdote re&s;pecting this village, is worth gleaning. The Dutch were &s;aved here in 1612 by an extra|ordinary circum&s;tance. When Louis the Fourteenth came down upon them, he propo&s;ed to enter the province of Holland by land, that his fleet, in conjunction with that of Great Britain might make a de&s;cent on the &s;ide of the Hague by the &s;ea. When the united fleets came up within &s;ight of Scheveling, and were preparing to land, the tide changed its u&s;ual cour&s;e, and &s;topped for &s;everal hours, though, at other times, very regular. The inhabitants were amazed. The next morning De Ruyter, the brave Dutch Admiral, came up, and the Engli&s;h and French fleets were di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm.
<P>Of this fact, which is unque&s;tionable, we are pre&s;ented with &s;ome moral animadver&s;ions, by tho&s;e who attribute it to the immediate interpo&s;ition of Providence, while others, who "hate miracles," &s;ays the morali&s;t, pretend that it happened at a great ebb. But then, adds the advocate for miracles, was not this very ebb in it&s;elf a Providence, as the terrible de&s;cent which mu&s;t have exterminated the Republick, was to happen punctually at that, and no other time? Indeed, one of our own writers (Bi&s;hop Burnet) &s;eems to favor the then general opinion of its being among&s;t the peculiar protections of a &s;u|perior power. In his Hi&s;tory of his own Times, we find the following pa&s;&s;age, confirming the truth of the event; though po&s;&s;ibly, with &s;ome others, you may not con&s;ider the te&s;timony of our wonder-loving prelate, as adding much &s;trength to a modern miracle. <Q>Soon after the Engli&s;h fleet had refitted them&s;elves, (&s;ays his lord&s;hip), they appeared in &s;ight of Scheveling, making up to the &s;hore. The tide turned, but they reckoned, that with the next flood, they would certainly land the forces that were on board, where they were like to make no re&s;i&s;tance. The States &s;ent to the Prince for &s;ome regiments to hinder the de&s;cent, but he could not &s;pare many men, having the French near him. So between the two the country was given up for lo&s;t, unle&s;s De Ruyter &s;hould come up: the flood returned, which the people thought was to end in their ruin; but, to all their amazement, after it had flowed two or three hours, an ebb of many hours &s;uc|ceeded, which carried the fleet again to &s;ea; and before that was &s;pent, De Ruyter came in view. This they reckoned a miracle wrought for their pre&s;ervation.</Q></P>
<P>You are not ignorant, that, &s;ome years prior to this event, our King Charles, during his long exile, embarked twice at Scheveling.</P></NOTE> The village of Scheveling con&s;i&s;ts of one very long, pretty &s;treet, and two or three &s;mal|ler

<PB N="93" REF="112">for &s;ingle men at the Hague) he conducted us to a cat-hole of a place, where the cat would have panted for breath, without any hope of getting it; and in this curious cabinet, in the darke&s;t corner, was crowded a &s;omething by way of bed, ten times more di&s;ordered than that which held the unfortunate Villers Duke of Buckingham. "Will it do?" a&s;ked the Dutch|man, with a gravity provokingly inflexible. <HI>"Do!</HI> (&s;aid I) DO?" <Q>What you do not ap|prove of it then? There's no harm done,</Q> quoth the Dutchman, &s;hutting it up, and walk|ing off; <Q>an old friend of mine, however, and who once &s;aved my life, has &s;lept on it &s;ome years; and, if it was good enough for him, it might &s;erve your turn, I &s;hould think, who are a &s;tranger I never &s;aw before.</Q></P>
<P>I really was indignant <HI>beyond</HI> &s;peaking. We had now gained the &s;treet-door; a huge Po|meranian <HI>dog</HI> lay at it: "O, <HI>here</HI> he is," ex|claimed the Dutchman; <Q>what do you think, my poor old <HI>Pomm?</HI> this <HI>heer</HI> (gentleman) though a perfect &s;tranger, a&s;ked me for a bed, and I was ju&s;t going to let him have your's; but luckily he did not accept it; and I am glad on it, for I &s;hould have been an ungrateful fellow, to have turned you out of
<PB N="94" REF="113">your bed, for a man I never &s;aw before in my life.&mdash;Poor old <HI>Pomm!</HI> do you remember what you did for me off the Doggerbank, when I was wa&s;hed over-board? Do you re|member how you pulled me, and held me by the nape of the neck, till my me&s;&s;mates got me out of the water. You left your marks on me. Look here Pomm; and while this is in my fle&s;h, &s;hall I turn thee out of thy bed? No, d&mdash;n me, Pomm&mdash;not for all the <HI>heers</HI> (gentlemen) of Chri&s;tendom!</Q></P>
<P>My companion a&s;&s;ured me this was as nearly a literal tran&s;lation as po&s;&s;ible: and from my knowledge of the Dutch language &s;ince, and of the impre&s;&s;ion made of the &s;ounds on my me|mory at the time, I find it was &s;o. But there were other &s;igns of the fidelity of the tran&s;lation, but the action which accompanied the words, the care&s;&s;es which the Dutchman lavi&s;hed on his dog, the rebuke with which he loaded him&s;elf, and the tears which fell from his eyes&mdash;not u&s;ed to weep&mdash;when he &s;hewed to the pre&s;erver of his life, the marks in his neck, were ante|cedent, and &s;uperior to all the language yet &s;poken by human beings.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="114">I was di&s;armed. I &s;aw very plainly, that the Dutchman, yielding to my importunities, which were very earne&s;t, had no way of putting an end to them, but by a &s;troke of waggery, and <HI>apparent</HI> extortion, which he was &s;atisfied I could not give into, and his &s;tratagem &s;uc|ceeded. I con&s;idered poor old <HI>Pomm</HI> as a be|nefactor, and the Dutchman as a grateful fel|low&mdash;though I &s;till think old <HI>Pomm</HI> might have been better lodged.</P>
<P>Touch my affections, and do what you will with me; but excite my di&s;gu&s;t, by cold, de|&s;igned impo&s;ition, neither enlivened by fro|lick, nor recompen&s;ed by humanity&mdash;I revolt at, and whenever I am able, puni&s;h it.</P>
<P>Of this kind is the behaviour of a fellow in the village, which has yielded the&s;e little ad|ventures. His hou&s;e is &s;ituated &s;o commo|diou&s;ly to the &s;ea, of which it has the entire command, as it has of every thing, within many leagues, moving on the face of the wa|ters, that it would <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> a moderate &s;hare of impo&s;ition, and I am &s;orry to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of letting you know this man indulges in &s;uch an unrea&s;onable extortion, that neither
<PB N="96" REF="115">you, or any of my countrymen, &s;hall become his victims, <HI>if I can help it.</HI></P>
<P>Wearied with &s;auntering along the beach, I &s;at my&s;elf down at this man's hou&s;e to repo&s;e; after which I followed the example of a Dutch gentleman, then in the &s;ame room, and whom I had ju&s;t ob&s;erved pay <HI>four</HI> &s;tivers (four pence) for a gla&s;s of milk and geneva, and a plate of &s;hrimps&mdash;a common refre&s;hment here, and to be had in great perfection.</P>

<P>What is that to you?&mdash;he is a cu&s;tomer; he often comes to my hou&s;e; he is a Dutchman! Do you think I can afford to treat &s;trangers as I do my own countrymen?&mdash;a man, from God knows where, like a gentleman who lives at the Hague&mdash;and who is a magi&s;trate?</P>

<P>On getting down &s;tairs, he de&s;ired to &s;ee no more of me. O were all commands as ea&s;y to be obeyed! On enquiry, and repre&s;entation of this fact at the <HI>table d'hote,</HI> where I that day dined, I found &s;everal gentlemen had met the &s;ame extravagance, accompanied by the &s;ame in&s;olence. As well, therefore, in ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment, as in patriot good will to the Engli&s;h publick in general, and to you, my friend, in particular, I have <HI>marked</HI> this man, and his hou&s;e
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems as if extortion was hereditary here; for we find it recorded, that this very hou&s;e, which had been an inn half a century ago, &s;tood empty a number of years, on account of the impo&s;ing charges of the inn-keepers. <Q>The man that kept it la&s;t, (&s;ays an authentick traveller) broke. He tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed grievou&s;ly on the &s;tranger's pocket; and, in con&s;equence, came to nothing, unlamented, after having made his rapacity &s;ufficiently known, to drive every body from his hou&s;e, not|with&s;tanding the beauty of its &s;ituation.</Q> But notwith&s;tand|ing this example before his eyes, mine ho&s;t has not profited of it. If my friend and reader takes warning, that will be &s;uffi|cient.</NOTE>; and farther inform you that the name
<PB N="99" REF="118">of the former is Grevers, and the &s;ign of the latter, the Heeren Logement.</P>
<P>Beware; it is a duty we owe our&s;elves, and &s;ociety, not to be the dupe of an impo&s;ition in <HI>any</HI> country. I &s;hould not have even known to what a degree this was one, had I not been pre&s;ent at the Dutch gentleman's payment for preci&s;ely the &s;ame articles; though common experience mu&s;t have con&s;idered it as in&s;uffera|ble, being within two &s;tivers (two pence) ex|actly what you give at the <HI>table d'hote</HI> of the Mare&s;chal de Turenne, for as good a dinner con&s;i&s;ting of two excellent cour&s;es, and a libe|ral de&s;ert) as you can have in any part of Lon|don, for half a crown a-head. As the fir&s;t part of this adventure then, &s;erves as a warn|ing for the Schevelin inn, let this conclu&s;ion of it operate as a recommendation to the hotel at the Hague.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="119">But judge not, from the&s;e individual in|&s;tances, either way, or at either place, that all is fair dealing at the Hague, or all extortion at Schevelin. I have very pointed in&s;tances in re&s;erve, where you will &s;ee an exact inver&s;ion of the exceptions, viz. abominable extortion at the Hague, and excellent behaviour, com|bined with a rea&s;onable charge, at Schevelin.</P>
<P>And, as I am &s;ure I &s;hall do a more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the Briti&s;h traveller, by occa&s;ionally (as they occur in my path) gleaning for him the&s;e remarks for the government of his pur&s;e, and per&s;on, than if I were to pre&s;ent him with the name of every painter, and the hi&s;tory of every painting, with the natural hi&s;tory of every butterfly, and bug, in the Prince's mu&s;eum; I &s;hall, in the proper times and places, remem|ber to hold out to him, hints of both the&s;e examples.</P>
<P>At the pre&s;ent moment, if you plea&s;e, we will amu&s;e our&s;elves on the beach, where you will &s;ee upwards of 100 large fi&s;hing boats, Dutch-built of cour&s;e, drawn up in array, equi|di&s;tant from each other, their nets &s;pread for drying to the &s;un, the colours of their pro|vinces flying; their &s;ails, yellow and deep brown, drying al&s;o; and making, thus a&s;&s;o|ciated,
<PB N="101" REF="120">and arranged, a very agreeable ap|pearance.</P>
<P>During the &s;hort vacation which the tide al|lows, it is curious to ob&s;erve the employments, and pa&s;times, carried on by the&s;e &s;ons and daughters of indu&s;try, who not only live <HI>by,</HI> but almo&s;t <HI>on,</HI> that various element, with which they are encompa&s;&s;ed. Football, cricket, quoits, races, by men, women, and children, the aged and the young; dances on the &s;and, the fi&s;h-carriers and the fi&s;hermen becoming part|ners, joining hands, &s;ome of them apparently joining hearts, (cheeks and lips very often); boys bathing the draft dogs, girls tho&s;e happier puppies doomed to favouriti&s;m; little creatures without &s;hoes or &s;tockings &s;wimming and div|ing like the fi&s;hes, among&s;t which they live; &s;ome, as if the &s;ea &s;ervice was an innate idea, (though it is more like imitation) converting their very hats and &s;abots into boats, and their &s;hirts into &s;ails, &s;wim out with them in tow &s;o far into the &s;ea, that an Engli&s;h mother would tremble to behold them. The &s;etting the boats off, when the tide &s;erves, is, likewi&s;e, another plea&s;ant pro&s;pect. They are all in ex|treme good fellow&s;hip, and &s;tart, as nearly as may be, all at once; then &s;pread, and &s;eparate,
<PB N="102" REF="121">which is a fre&s;h marine picture; and when the weather is fine is truly amu&s;ing; the more &s;o, as, on account of the different figure, fa&s;hion, &s;ails, colours, and cour&s;es of the boats, the appearance is very di&s;tinct from what we ob|&s;erve on the &s;ea coa&s;ts in the Engli&s;h fi&s;hery. While they are gone, the &s;ports, though by the ab&s;ence of the &s;ailors&mdash;
<Q>"Maim'd of half their joys."</Q> are re&s;umed. The incredible &s;hoals of children in this little town, begin to make me think it was with good rea&s;on, the ancient poets made the queen of love &s;pring from the &s;ea; and it is an ob&s;ervation, that I fancy every coa&s;t town corroborates. But <HI>this</HI> exceeds all I ever be|held; though, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, few of them &s;eem to have been the de&s;cendants of Venus; for a more abhorrent &s;et of little naked cupids, never wa&s;hed them&s;elves in their parent waves. Yet, they are all healthy, and all happy. The <HI>return</HI> of the boats is a &s;cene of bu&s;y expectation. Hundreds of ba&s;ket-women, barrow-men, and barrow dogs, are &s;tretched along the beach, even to the edge of the waters, but no farther; for none of the&s;e women, or very few, go un|&s;hod, or un&s;tockinged. On the contrary, they
<PB N="103" REF="122">are remarkably neat in their blue wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and &s;lippers; and, however, many of the former may &s;hew the marks of hou&s;e|wifry, an hole in them is not only extraordinary, but &s;candalous: nor are the&s;e girls, or women, in any re&s;pect indecent. They nod, &s;mile on, je&s;t with, every pa&s;&s;enger they meet, (all through Holland, unle&s;s you obviou&s;ly &s;hun their harmle&s;s familiarity;) but never pa&s;s this bound; it is a kind of courte&s;y here, be|longing to this cla&s;s of people; and is, per|haps, a better way than having to pull your hat off every other moment, (which is the ca&s;e in their great towns) in exchange of the trouble|&s;ome civility of the citizens and gentry.&mdash; Even the female <HI>children</HI> are only permitted to dabble without their &s;tockings, while the boys a&s;&s;ert, very early, the privileges of the hardy &s;ex, and grow adventurous by pre&s;cription. On the unlading of the boats, every barrow, and ba&s;ket is filled to the brim, &s;ometimes by &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and dogs, boys, men, and women, &s;et "doggedly to work," as Dr. John&s;on &s;trangely expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and run, or rather trot to the Hague market with earne&s;t activity. This &s;huts up the amu&s;e|ments of the beach; &s;o with your permi&s;&s;ion, after a pau&s;e, we will return al&s;o.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>YES, my friend, we will return, but not exactly by the &s;ame way we came, enchanting as it was. After you have taken a peep, at our re-entrance of the before de&s;cribed walks, to &s;urvey the moving picture (and a very &s;ingu|lar one it is) of the &s;warms of fi&s;h-boys, fi&s;h-men, fi&s;h-girls, fi&s;h-dogs, and fi&s;h alive, filling every path in the long avenues; &s;triving which &s;hall arrive with their loads fir&s;t to market. I beg to take you by the hand, and conduct you as entirely out of the &s;ight of the&s;e, and <HI>all other</HI> public objects, as if you were in the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of Wind&s;or, or any le&s;s fa&s;hionable, fore&s;t. You gue&s;s, already, I allude to what I called the <HI>concealed</HI> walks, in the out&s;et of my de&s;cription.&mdash;Yes, let us glide into one of the&s;e&mdash;both are of equal beauty&mdash;and&mdash;
<Q>"The world forgetting, by the world forgot;"</Q> let us have this little green regalia wholly to our&s;elves. In this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot of half a league; &s;ituated, as it is, in a land, which may
<PB N="105" REF="124">almo&s;t be con&s;idered as "in the flat &s;ea &s;unk," &mdash;even in Holland; and within a few furlongs of that very &s;ea&mdash;we &s;hall be pre&s;ented with as verdant paths, as redundant foliage, as imper|vious glooms, as agreeable openings to the &s;un, and as rich a variety of objects in <HI>keeping</HI> with &s;uch &s;cenery, as in the mo&s;t happy woodlands of our own country; even in that delightful part of it (Wales,) which occupied &s;o large a &s;hare of our earlier corre&s;pondence. <HI>There,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, Nature is a volunteer. Here, &s;he has been pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice: in Cambria, &s;he has "fixed her &s;eats of deare&s;t re&s;idence;" &s;he is a native.&mdash;In Holland, &s;he is an exotic, dragged reluctantly from home, and made to e&s;tabli&s;h in a foreign &s;oil. In Great Britain, &s;he con&s;ents willingly to yield up her blooming beauty, and is en|amoured of the clime. In Italy, yet more; &mdash;there &s;he luxuriates. In Holland, the vegetable godde&s;s, like many of her &s;ex, has been &s;o long, and &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly wooed, that, after unavailing re&s;i&s;tance and refu&s;al, &s;he gives up the point to her per&s;evering lover, and makes him happy to get rid of his importunity. And in this country &s;he has been &s;o care&s;&s;ed, invited, and cheri&s;hed,&mdash;the whole Republic have, indeed, paid &s;uch homage to her, &s;ince

<P>The &s;pot we are &s;urveying is, indeed, pre|eminently favoured. Our path, you ob&s;erve, is on the &s;urface of a fine terrace, wide enough to admit half a dozen per&s;ons abrea&s;t in &s;ome places, and narrowing, imperceptibly, in others, &s;o as to admit only, what is u&s;ually more agreeable in &s;uch &s;ort of walks&mdash;a <HI>t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te.</HI> Nay, one &s;ide, (the left, returning to the Hague)&mdash;runs off into a variety of woody re|ce&s;&s;es, the footway of which is adapted only to a &s;oliloquy&mdash;&s;uch, as &s;ome few minds know how to turn to even &s;ocial advantage &mdash;&s;uch as yours, my friend.</P>
<Q><L>"Thou who art fitted,</L>
<L>"Or in Courts to &s;hine,</L>
<L>"With unaffected grace, or walk the plain;</L>
<L>"With innocence and meditation join'd,</L>
<L>"In &s;oft a&s;&s;emblage."</L></Q>
<P>It would employ more time than we have to &s;pare, were we to turn into any one of the&s;e winding walks, and &s;uffer our&s;elves to be led
<PB N="107" REF="126">away by its &s;educing deviations.&mdash;It is invol|ved in &s;o many vernal labyrinths, that I can only recommend them to you, when Solitude, and her companions, Poe&s;y, and let me add, Philo&s;ophy, concur, with lei&s;ure, to devote a morning, or evening to &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates. Keep|ing the terrace, we &s;hall, for the time that is on our hands, be &s;ufficiently gratified. As we go along, you, who are new to the &s;cene, will be &s;truck with rural objects, not often to be found in any country in the vicinity of the ocean; and of one of the mo&s;t <HI>populous,</HI> as well as <HI>po|pular</HI> towns in Europe. Among the&s;e, the &s;ound of that ocean, at fir&s;t loud and pa&s;|&s;ionate, moderating its wrath as we go far|ther on, till at length it &s;oftens, as if into &s;ounds of regret at having, in its anger, &s;ent us away, and per&s;ua&s;ively murmuring to invite our return. How ea&s;ily, without &s;training the allu&s;ion, may one apply this to the wayward, little animo&s;ities of this little life! in which, how often does the violence of rage&mdash;the mo&s;t foaming di&s;&s;onance, melt into the whi&s;pers of love! On the right hand of us, but many a foot beneath, for the terrace is extremely ele|vated, you perceive, the <HI>obvious</HI> roads; you catch a glimp&s;e of them, and of the pa&s;&s;engers; and, but a glimp&s;e, the next three or four
<PB N="108" REF="127">&s;teps &s;huts up the view, and you are again under covert of what Milton has called "a verdant wall." But were the public paths <HI>filled</HI> with <HI>living</HI> beauties, we might &s;uffer this ex|clu&s;ion from them (your pardon, fair ones, our exclu&s;ion is very temporary,) while "on &s;uch a night as this;" (for I <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to have the even|ing we are taking this walk a very fine one) added to the diver&s;ified &s;ounds of the &s;ea, we have the &s;ong of the nightingale, the note of the cuckoo, (who&s;e very hoar&s;ene&s;s has a charm for us; we are in the education, you know, of loving his voice to the la&s;t;) the concert of the &s;mall birds to amu&s;e the ear&mdash;the perfume of the wild-flowers, which are here in profu|&s;ion; the magnificence of the trees, many of which are, "of the fir&s;t order of &s;izes;" the oaks, for example, which are even of Druidi|cal dignity; the beaches, the American poplar, and a very luxuriant growth of underwood. The traveller, who has but a reli&s;h of the charms of verdure in him, cannot be weary of admiring the&s;e, and many other objects; though, (when he reflects on the general cha|racter, and, indeed, general &s;urface of Hol|land), he will be apt to wonder
<Q>"How the devil they got here."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="128">You &s;oon arrive at the barrier, from whence, to your &s;urpri&s;e, and it may happen in &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions of mind, to your di&s;like, you find your&s;elf in the &s;treets of the Hague; a rapid tran&s;ition from umbrage &s;o profound, might induce you to fancy your&s;elf, "in depth of woods embraced;" and then by another &s;troke of magic conveyed to a large town, which is the re&s;idence of courtiers, and the &s;eat of the Dutch government. Before we wholly lo&s;e &s;ight of this charming promenade, let us take a retro|&s;pective view of it from the barrier, which &s;hews us the per&s;pective of Scheveling church, as a terminating object; and which leads me to &s;ay a few parting words of the village.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torians of the place all &s;ay, that this little town is extremely ancient; and that it was more than double the &s;ize it now is. In 1470, the &s;ea, (which I have &s;ometimes &s;een more terrible here than a roaring lion; and in a very few hours after, it might have been likened to the &s;leeping lamb;) not only car|ried away one of its churches, but inundated more than two thou&s;and paces beyond it; and carried de&s;olation, and ruin in its cour&s;e. In 1530, the re&s;idue of the village, and
<PB N="110" REF="129">the villagers, very narrowly e&s;caped being &s;wallowed up, in the middle of the night. And, notwith&s;tanding the extreme height of the banks, formed by the &s;and|downs, the furious element, in di&s;dain of controul, broke over them, and deluged half the town &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the years 1538-46-51, and above all in 1570, on the day of All-Saints. On that fatal day one hundred and twenty hou&s;es, were either buried under the &s;ands, or dragged into the main, and the other church, which &s;tood in the heart of the village, was now le&s;t almo&s;t upon the beach, in which &s;ituation, it &s;tands at this moment, a &s;acred but &s;olitary monument of the &s;torm; and looks, to fancy's eye, as if it &s;till mourned the event. Since that time, however, the ocean has flowed within its bounds; the vil|lage is, in part, rebuilt. It is inhabited en|tirely by fi&s;hers, and publicans; the fir&s;t confine them&s;elves to the markets of Rot|terdam and the Hague; the la&s;t depend chiefly on the parties of plea&s;ure, which re|&s;ort to it in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. Such a thing as a private family building a pavi|lion in its neighbourhood, nor &s;carcely a lodger, except the old lady who boiled in
<PB N="111" REF="130">the tub, and my&s;elf, I really believe has not been heard or thought of the&s;e two hun|dred years; but then, you know, it is too near the <HI>"noxious vapours of the &s;ea."</HI> O, un|grateful Holland! thus to turn your back on your be&s;t friend! notwith&s;tanding he has &s;wal|lowed up &s;o many of your fi&s;hermen's hou&s;es, ye ought to build a temple to Neptune in every town of the Republic; and in tho&s;e within reach of his purifying breath, ye ought to erect one in every &s;treet! and on the portals,

<P>But I have mentioned my&s;elf as a lodger; one of tho&s;e beings, who, as I ob&s;erved before, the boiled lady excepted, never ap|peared on the coa&s;t: and being a &s;olitary wan|derer on the &s;hore, and moreover, a &s;elf-talker,

<P>Some &s;ummers ago, being on a vi&s;it to the excellent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. Potter, Prebendary of Norwich.</NOTE> poet and venerable man, on who&s;e recommendation, I bought the poor old hor&s;e, of who&s;e &s;tory, I gave you the Gleanings in a former letter. It was "my cu&s;tom always in the afternoon," to go forth into the fields, cottages, farm hou&s;es, while my friend was at his &s;tudies; he being at that time fini&s;hing his third and la&s;t tran&s;lation of the
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;chilus, Euripides, and Sophocles.</NOTE> three great fathers of ancient poetry. One day our di&s;|cour&s;es fell on our Engli&s;h Pindar, who&s;e noble ode founded on the pathetic tradition of the ma&s;&s;acre of the Welch bards, my friend re|cited &s;o as to divide the glory of the &s;ong, be|twixt the reader and the author: and, after this, he &s;tood forth the champion of this &s;ub|lime compo&s;ition; and entered into a warm, and ju&s;t vindication, of his favourite poet, who had been attacked with &s;uch barbarous fury by Dr. John&s;on: this manly defence is now in the hands of the public: it is, therefore, unnece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="115" REF="134">to mention its energy, its eloquence, or its ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Full of the &s;ubject, I &s;et off, on the even|ing of the day on which it was brought upon our &s;ocial carpet, as replete with materials for a long and loud &s;oliloquy, as any hero could de|&s;ire even on the French theatre; where he takes a whole &s;cene to him&s;elf, that he may ex|patiate at large on tho&s;e <HI>&s;ecret con&s;piracies,</HI> which he communicates to pit, boxes, and gal|lery. Every thing <HI>withoul,</HI> al&s;o, con&s;pired to aggravate the &s;tate of feeling <HI>within:</HI> the even|ing was lovely, was drawing to its clo&s;e; and really brought into effect, and clo&s;e under the eye, and into the heart, many of the objects &s;o exqui&s;itely de&s;cribed by this enchanting poet; literally, therefore, I was
<Q>"Wrapt in &s;ome &s;train of pen&s;ive Gray."</Q> It was at Scarning, near Dereham, in Norfolk, from which la&s;t mentioned place, &s;oon after I had got into the environs of the former, I <HI>heard</HI>
<Q>"The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day."</Q> I <HI>&s;aw</HI> too, at the &s;ame time,
<Q>"The lowing herd wind &s;lowly o'er the lea,"</Q>
<Q><PB N="116" REF="135">And ob&s;erved,

<Q><L>"Now fades the glimmering land&s;cape on the &s;ight,</L>

<Q>"Soothe the gloomy habit of my &s;oul."</Q> fly over my head, and after wheeling about a little, take up her lodging in preci&s;ely &s;uch an
<PB N="117" REF="136">"ivy-mantled tower," as that immortali&s;ed by the poet: &s;ome children, who &s;eeing her alight, threw up their hats after her; for which, though angry with them at fir&s;t, I felt much obliged, as very &s;oon after, &s;he hooted away mo&s;t delightfully; and as the moon now began to &s;hew her&s;elf, and the brats kept an|noying the ivytree, I had every rea&s;on in the world, you know, to con&s;ider my owl was

<L>"Mole&s;t her ancient, &s;olitary reign.</L></Q> In high good humour, to find every line <HI>tell</HI> in this manner, I pa&s;&s;ed on, quickening my pace, as mo&s;t people put into high &s;pirits &s;ud|denly, when they are walking, generally do: This, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the audience of pea&s;ants, might increa&s;e the ridicule, and the cau&s;e of it; for on turning my back on them, and &s;triding away, they changed their object from the owl to me, whom they hooted in much louder notes than the owl had hooted the moon; but, I be|lieve verily, had they <HI>pelted</HI> me at that moment, I &s;hould have forgiven them.</P>
<P>Yet, I was now too much warmed to con|tent my&s;elf with the Elegiac Mu&s;e&mdash;My

<Q><L>"Ruin &s;eize thee ruthle&s;s king!</L>

<P>I went home, when the fit was over, by ano|ther road, and &s;aw no more of my pity-&s;truck dame; but on my relating it at &s;upper to my friend, what was my &s;urpri&s;e to find that the identical old lady, had ju&s;t left the kitchen, having out of pure humanity enquired me out, come to know if I had got &s;afe back, as &s;he had "a parlous fear, I &s;hould lay violent hands on my&s;elf by the way."&mdash;The night turned out cloudy, and the poor creature was both lame and aged; neither of which circum&s;tances could withhold her from an office of di&s;in|tere&s;ted compa&s;&s;ion; for, among&s;t other mat|ters, &s;he told my friend's &s;ervants, that I had put a &s;hilling into her hands, which being a thing that never happened to her before, all the years &s;he had been at the gate, mu&s;t, for <HI>certain &s;ure,</HI> be a mi&s;take; and therefore, &s;he would have &s;urrendered it as a given evidence of the unfound &s;tate of my mind; of which &s;he would not, for even five &s;hillings, take any advantage! and it was not without difficulty, the dome&s;tics reconciled her to the keeping it,
<PB N="121" REF="140">ob&s;erving to her that its being returned, <HI>would make me wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>For more than a week after this, &s;he came, un&s;een by the parlour people, to know how I went on; and on being told, by my friend's footman, who had an arch &s;ort of gravity about him, that, upon the whole, I continued much the &s;ame; if any thing, <HI>rather wor&s;e;</HI> my worthy old dame &s;hook her head, and expre&s;&s;ed her hopes, and declared I &s;hould not want her prayers, that I might, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, keep out of <HI>chains,</HI> and <HI>a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat;</HI> and then &s;he hobbled away with tears in her eyes.</P>
<P>But pity is communicative; the u&s;ual way of confidence; this anecdote reached the men and women who were &s;itting round the tree; it then &s;pread to theowl and the ivy-bu&s;h; arrived at the green, where I &s;o deported my&s;elf, as to be hooted off the premi&s;es; putting all which to|gether, and adjoining the affair of purcha&s;ing the &s;uperannuated hor&s;e, that had I been in liti|gation with any man in that neighbourhood, for any thing worth an attempt to prove me <HI>non compos,</HI> there is not an old man, or woman, boy, or girl, within half a dozen miles of Scar|ning,

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Hague,</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE imperceptibly "beguiled the way" to your hotel, my friend, which I will &s;uppo&s;e you to regain ju&s;t in time for the Dutch theatre, which is among&s;t tho&s;e objects of curio&s;ity, that no traveller, who has but a reli&s;h of literature in him, would, as one would imagine, pa&s;s <HI>ungleaned;</HI> and yet I cannot find that any of our numerous Trippi&s;ts have deem|ed a critique of the &s;tage, or drama, of this country, worth their trouble. Unwilling, how|ever, to impute this negligence to national prejudice, or to a &s;upercilious opinion of our own theatre, I will pre&s;ume the authors who have vi&s;ited this country, either had not lei&s;ure to partake the amu&s;ement, or that they were in Holland during the rece&s;&s;es of dramatic ex|hibitions.</P>
<P>In this re&s;pect, therefore, I am to account my&s;elf more fortunate; and &s;uppo&s;ing you at my &s;ide, will expect you to join me in the gratula|tion.
<PB N="124" REF="143">&mdash;But I feel the nece&s;&s;ity of becoming <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> on this occa&s;ion; you &s;ee my wi&s;h to be <HI>&s;ocial</HI> has led me into &s;ome confu&s;ion by run|ning the fir&s;t and &s;econd <HI>per&s;ons</HI> into one an|other, and by perplexing the &s;ingular and plural <HI>numbers.</HI></P>
<P>Shrinking, therefore, into <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I proceed to inform you, that my fir&s;t vi&s;it to the play|hou&s;e here, was on the evening when the tra|gedy of Hamlet, and the character of the Queen, by a celebrated actre&s;s, held out a double attraction.</P>
<P>The Dutch Hamlet is, almo&s;t, a literal tran|&s;lation of the German, but differs, importantly, from the Engli&s;h in fable and character.</P>
<P>The &s;tory is &s;imply this&mdash;The King of Den|mark has been poi&s;oned by a favourite of the Queen; and that Prince&s;s, in the headlong vi|olence of her pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;ented to the death of her hu&s;band, and promi&s;ed to reward his murderer with her hand and crown. The piece opens immediately after the commi&s;&s;ion of this bloody deed; and the fir&s;t &s;cene is al|lotted to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and a friend, who is con|fidential, and indeed an accomplice in the
<PB N="125" REF="144">villainy. In the &s;econd &s;cene, a di&s;covery of the murder is made to the Queen by the lover, who claims his recompence, which, from the "compunctuous vi&s;itings of nature," is refu&s;ed. Many high-wrought &s;entiments are given by the royal, &s;elf-made widow, to ju&s;|tify a breach of her wicked promi&s;e, and to determine on throwing the whole regal power into the hands of her &s;on Hamlet. This re|&s;olution &s;he maintains &s;o &s;teadily, that her lover (Clodius) the murderer, is converted into her mo&s;t inveterate enemy.</P>
<P>Various &s;cenes of &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s en&s;ue. An interview takes place betwixt young Hamlet and his mother, in which the con&s;cience of the latter impells her to relate her &s;hare in the death of her hu&s;band, to the former, who has been apprized by his father's gho&s;t, of the hor|rid deed.&mdash;This gho&s;t is <HI>&s;aid</HI> to haunt him every where, but does not make its public ap|pearance.</P>
<P>The Dutch Ophelia is the daughter of the murderer, Clodius&mdash;of cour&s;e, the &s;ame prin|ciple that prevents the Queen mother from an union with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of her hu&s;band, de&s;troys the intended nuptials betwixt Ophelia and
<PB N="126" REF="145">Hamlet. Hereupon, the virtuous &s;acrifices of pa&s;&s;ion to principle produce &s;everal very tender and affecting &s;cenes. The filial piety of Ham|let, and the con&s;titutional melancholy &s;o ex|qui&s;itely touched by Shak&s;peare, is, by no means, feebly &s;upported by the German poet, or by the Dutch tran&s;lator. The introduction of a &s;acred va&s;e, in which are depo&s;ited the a&s;hes of the poi&s;oned monarch, is very hap|pily brought on, and the addre&s;&s;es of the pi|ous and heart-wounded &s;on to it, pre&s;s clo&s;e on the &s;ofte&s;t and be&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of our nature. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es of Hamlet to the a&s;hes of his father, the Queen enters, and her &s;on, wrought to agony, goes up to her, and with the outraged feelings of a &s;on &s;o &s;ituated, a&s;ks&mdash;<HI>Where is my father?</HI> on her refu&s;ing to an&s;wer which que&s;tion, he leads her to the urn, and in the &s;ame &s;tyle of eloquent brevity exclaims&mdash;See, mother&mdash;here is <HI>all you have left me of him!</HI></P>
<P>This calls forth all the pa&s;&s;ions of a &s;on, and all the penitence of a mother. The lat|ter implores her death, the former attempts it; the dagger is pointed at her bo&s;om; the parent kneels to receive, the child to give the blow; but, by a powerful working of
<PB N="127" REF="146">nature, the &s;on falls into the embraces of his mother, wholly di&s;armed. They ri&s;e together, and Hamlet, unable to execute his purpo&s;e, ru&s;hes away, exclaiming&mdash;"The wife has killed her hu&s;band, and my father, it is true; but the mother mu&s;t not be murdered by the &s;on!"</P>
<P>The fate of this unhappy prince&s;s is, with more <HI>natural</HI> ju&s;tice con&s;igned, by the Au&s;trian bard, to the hand of her lover, the guilty Clodius, who, failing in the attempt to de&s;troy Hamlet, is him&s;elf &s;tabbed by that prince, and the piece concludes with Hamlet's re&s;olution, to prefer life to death for the &s;ake of virtue, and the good of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, then, that the Queen is here a fair penitent, and con&s;equently appears on the Dutch and German &s;tages in a much more amiable light than on the Briti&s;h theatre; and judging her, even on Shak&s;peare's own rule, is to be preferred to Gertrude; &s;ince,
<Q><L>"The wicked, compar'd with the <HI>more</HI> wicked,</L>
<L>"Seem beautiful; and not to be the wor&s;t,</L>
<L>"Stands in &s;ome rank of prai&s;e."</L></Q> But, of the two Ophelia's, that of Shak&s;peare has every claim to pre-eminence. We &s;ee
<PB N="128" REF="147">nothing of the gentle Ro&s;encrantz, or Gilden|&s;tern, nor of Polonius, or of his &s;on Laertes. And it is, indeed, no great matter; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf Gothic enough to have felt much chagrined at the exclu&s;ion of the hone&s;t grave-diggers, who, in their way, are certainly "fellows of infinite je&s;t," and have often amu&s;ed me. The gho&s;t, as I have al|ready ob&s;erved, never comes on the &s;tage. A gentleman of our party told me, it had made its <HI>entr&eacute;</HI> la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, but, at the in&s;tance of &s;ome of the burgoma&s;ters wives, though it was not confined to its pri&s;on-hou&s;e, it was now forbid to <HI>walk in &s;ight.</HI> This inhibition mu&s;t certainly be regarded as a &s;ingular piece of gallantry in the Dutch magi&s;trates; but I do not clearly enter into the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of it. To make me &s;en&s;ible of which, however, the gentleman informed me, it was thought danger|ous for ladies in <HI>certain &s;ituations.</HI> Yet, unle&s;s the Dutch women could contrive to mark their offspring with the <HI>&s;hadow of a &s;hade,</HI> I cannot &s;till &s;ee any thing <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> in their complaint again&s;t this poor &s;pectre; and I mu&s;t own to you, Sir, (continued I to the gentleman,) that it is with regret I perceive my old friend For|tinbra&s;s is bani&s;hed from your &s;tage; and can a&s;&s;ure you, that the bulk of our Engli&s;h audi|ences
<PB N="129" REF="148">would &s;ooner give up the Prince of Denmark him&s;elf, than the apparition of his father. The fact, replied the gentleman, may be, that our wives in Holland are, in effect, the <HI>magi&s;trates;</HI> and would, perhaps, (inter|rupted I, in the words of Shak&s;peare) "make a gho&s;t of him who &s;hould dare to di&s;obey."</P>
<P>But look, (exclaimed my companion) Ham|let SEEMS to &s;ee the &s;pirit of his father now. I was convinced, from the ge&s;ticulation of the actor on this occa&s;ion, that the gho&s;t could not be exiled without injury; for, in con&s;equence of this bani&s;hment, in courte&s;y to the female part of the auditory, the attempt of SEEMING TO SEE produced &s;uch di&s;tortions as were truly di&s;gu&s;ting. The actor &s;o turned up the &s;ight, that we could catch only the white of his eyes, thereby, I &s;uppo&s;e, in&s;inuating, that he beheld the gho&s;t of his father in his "mind's eye" only; but even, then, we are to conclude the Dutch mind to take up her lodging very far in the back part of the &s;cull, for the performers eyes were trying to hide them&s;elves in that direction. Indeed, Prior tells us, that
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Alma, they &s;trenuou&s;ly maintain,</L>
<L>"Sits cockhor&s;e on her throne the brain,</L>
<L>"And from that &s;eat of thought di&s;pen&s;es</L>
<L>"Her &s;ov'reign plea&s;ure to the &s;en&s;es."</L></Q></NOTE> "Alma
<PB N="130" REF="149">(the &s;oul) has her principal palace in the brain:" if this be true, the actor was right.</P>
<P>But letting this pa&s;s, there are many very pathetic touches in the play that would not have di&s;honoured Shak&s;peare him&s;elf; and, notwith&s;tanding my love of that great poet, and my admiration of this his mo&s;t philo|&s;ophical drama, I was highly gratified with as much of the Dutch Hamlet as I could under|&s;tand. With regard to the repre&s;entation, I &s;hould be guilty of a mo&s;t invidious hypercri|tici&s;m, were I to cavil at what my feelings a&s;|&s;ured me was &s;trong, natural, and impre&s;&s;ive. The Queen was a very fine piece of acting throughout. &mdash; Mademoi&s;elle Wattier is the Siddons of the Am&s;terdam &s;tage. Before I went to the theatre, &s;he was &s;o overprai&s;ed (as it appeared) by the party with whom I dined, that the panegyric had the effect of making me enter the hou&s;e almo&s;t with a prejudice; for &s;uch hyperbole, be&s;ides that it is very un|wi&s;e, is, in general, very untrue. This was, however, a very happy exception, as Made|moi&s;elle Wattier really beggared the loftie&s;t rhap&s;ody of her admirers. She has all the grace and energy of Mrs. Siddons's move|ment, with equal powers of face and of figure:
<PB N="131" REF="150">her eyes are of the &s;ame colour, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no le&s;s fire, no le&s;s &s;oftne&s;s; and every turn of her per&s;on, in the variety of the pa&s;&s;ion to be expre&s;&s;ed, would, &s;till Siddons like, have formed the &s;ubject of a ma&s;terly painter, could he have caught the emotions as they ro&s;e. Her abhorrence of her lover, af|ter he had a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated her hu&s;band&mdash;her &s;corn|ful rejection of his bloody hand&mdash;her indigna|tion again&s;t her&s;elf, at having promi&s;ed to accept it on &s;uch conditions, and her triumph on the breach of her ra&s;h vow, are all &s;trokes highly favourable to the di&s;play of tragic ta|lents, and were given by this great performer in the noble&s;t &s;tyle of that &s;ublime &s;implicity for which our own Enchantre&s;s of the Briti&s;h Drama is &s;o worthily celebrated.</P>
<P>Nor was the part of the Prince of Denmark ill &s;u&s;tained. I could not, however, but take notice, that the flowing trains and robes are on the Dutch, as on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, of infinite u&s;e to the performers; each of whom were <HI>au fait</HI> to this tragic auxiliary, in the bye|play and trick of the &s;cene&mdash;little arts that are known to have their effect every where&mdash; they might be thought the works of &s;upe|rogation.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="151">A few nights after, the announce of Elfrida drew me again to the theatre. Of this per|formance, as of the other, I &s;hall pre&s;ent you with a comparative view, becau&s;e this appears to me the be&s;t way of marking the variations and &s;imilitudes which characterize the re&s;pec|tive &s;tages; and the Dutch theatre, like the language and inhabitants, has been &s;o gene|rally ridiculed for its <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed lethargy and inele|gance,</HI> that it will be quite a novelty in a foreigner, and e&s;pecially an Engli&s;h one, to do it hone&s;t, or even neighbourly ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The &s;tories of Elfrida are nearly the &s;ame in the Engli&s;h and Au&s;train plays; and that which I &s;aw repre&s;ented at the Hague is nearly a literal tran&s;lation from the German; but one very marking difference is immediately ma|nife&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that with all the charms of Ma|&s;on's poetry, and with the &s;uperadded magic of the mu&s;ic, with all the pomps of proce&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. &amp;c. an Engli&s;h audience <HI>almo&s;t</HI> &s;leeps, and <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> gapes, over the Engli&s;h Elfrida; whereas the Dutch&mdash;pray forgive me, my dear national friends&mdash;the Dutch Elfrida, keeps every eye open, and every heart throbbing at the "cunning of the &s;cene," which at once ex|cites the hope and fear of the &s;pectator.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="152">There is, however, one very unnatural inci|dent. After Edgar had detected the fal&s;hood of Athelwold, as to his de&s;cription of Elfrida's beauty, he challenged him to &s;ingle combat, as the only manly way left to decide who&s;e wife &s;he &s;hould be. Athelwold falls, and his body is brought on the &s;tage; but even while Elfrida, in the di&s;traction of her mind, is weeping over it&mdash;the &s;anguine mark of Edgar's &s;abre full in her view, Earl Orgar, her ambi|tious father, comes to try all his powers of threat and intreaty in favour of her hu&s;band's recent murderer; and this prepo&s;terous idea is afterwards, while
<Q>"The memory of her lov'd Lord is green,"</Q> followed up by Edgar him&s;elf, who pre&s;&s;es the &s;uit, and &s;eems to think it very hard he is not immediately &s;ucce&s;sful. I have &s;eldom &s;een, even on the &s;tage, a more gro&s;s violation of nature: a murderer making love to the wife of a tenderly beloved hu&s;band, who&s;e corp&s;e, mangled by that very murderer, is lying in the &s;ame room, &s;till bleeding, and &s;carcely cold from the wound. Yet even the&s;e circum|&s;tances were forgotten, amid&s;t the overpower|ing excellence of Mademoi&s;elle Wattier. Mrs. Siddons could not more completely have anni|hilated them.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="153">The unfortunate Elfrida has no way of e&s;|caping this &s;econd marriage, even before the
<Q><L>&mdash;"funeral bak'd meats</L>
<L>"Could coldly furni&s;h forth the marriage table,"</L></Q> but by e&s;caping from life, which &s;he effects by &s;tabbing her&s;elf, and dies, gra&s;ping the hand of Athelwold. The la&s;t act, which falls almo&s;t wholly to Athelwold's widow, is, in point of words, the &s;horte&s;t, and, in point of matter, the longe&s;t I ever &s;aw, and is acted by Mademoi&s;elle Wattier up to nature in her bolde&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t powers. Human ge|nius and feeling, aided by human art, &s;el|dom have gone higher. I have the tears, the terrors, the aweful &s;ilence, and the aggra|gated bur&s;t of admiration in an whole audi|ence, in evidence of this a&s;&s;ertion. Her &s;upplicatory addre&s;&s;es, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to &s;ave her Athelwold; her delight on receiving Edgar's in&s;idious promi&s;e, that he &s;hould be forgiven the offence of honourable love; her expre&s;&s;ion of unutterable grief at receiving the news of his death; her tender &s;ervices over his body; her attempts to &s;oothe her fa|ther from his cruel purpo&s;e of hurrying her into an unnatural marriage; her increa&s;ing re|&s;olution to avoid it; her gradual lo&s;s of
<PB N="135" REF="154">&s;en&s;e; her momentary returns of intellect; her affecting relap&s;es; the manner of her drawing the dagger, &s;miling upon, and ardently ki&s;&s;ing it, as the guardian of her decea&s;ed hu&s;|band's honour; the lucid intervals of her rea&s;on and con&s;cience, even after &s;he has point|ed the dagger at her bo&s;om; the &s;udden vio|lence with which con&s;cience and rea&s;on are hurled from their throne at the &s;ight of Athel|wold's wounds; her &s;econd attempts on her|&s;elf; and in that in&s;tant the manner of her falling on her knees, to look the prayer &s;he could not utter, every feature importuning the Merciful for pardon and pity; the air of &s;a|tisfaction with which &s;he then plunged the poignard in her brea&s;t, as if certain her prayer had been granted; the imitated movements of her death; the agony at vainly trying to find the hand of Athelwold; her joy on finding it at la&s;t, though the King of Terrors &s;eemed to pull back her own; and her expiring groan, were repre&s;ented in a manner &s;o ju&s;t, ani|mated, and bold, that "take it for all in all," I truly think I have never &s;een eloquence of ac|tion, unborrowed of the tongue, imitated with more energy. After &s;he fell, there was a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes, the &s;ilence that might have been felt. It &s;urely could not have been more pro|found,
<PB N="136" REF="155">more impre&s;&s;ive, had a &s;eries of tho&s;e calamitous incidents which had been imagined, actually happened. The audience, indeed, were too deeply moved to expre&s;s them&s;elves in the ordinary way of noi&s;y acclamation; mo&s;t of them left the hou&s;e before the laugh of the farce had weakened the force of their &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>And now, my friend, having done an act of ju&s;tice, and no more than ju&s;tice, to the per|formers, let me dare to extend the principle of equity to the audiences of Holland, from who&s;e hearts, as it were, by the common con|&s;ent of nations, pity, pa&s;&s;ion, and every <HI>capa|city</HI> of <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> has been excluded; other countries proudly and &s;elfi&s;hly deeming them heavy as their atmo&s;phere, and torpid as their lakes. This imputed apathy has pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb, in&s;omuch that when any remarkable &s;tupor attaches to a man's character in any other country, he is pronounced, by way of &s;tigma, <HI>as dull as a Dutchman.</HI></P>
<P>That there is a general appearance, and that there may be a general languor and lethargy in this people, till &s;trongly excited, is cer|tain; but when the proper objects of the
<PB N="137" REF="156">powerful emotions are called forth, either by real or fancied events, I have never &s;een, in any country, heads or hearts more replete with &s;ound &s;en&s;e or good feeling; nor did there ever &s;it, at the theatric phaenomena of our &s;tage &mdash;Mrs. Siddons, Mr. Garrick, or Mon&s;ieur Le Kain&mdash;an auditory who &s;eemed to have a better &s;en&s;e of what was &s;ublime, or a finer touch of what was beautiful, than the audiences of Am&s;terdam and the Hague, whenever I have been a &s;pectator. In truth, the Dutch have, on the &s;core of in&s;en&s;bility, been &s;o much the deri&s;ion of other nations, that they may very fairly apply the words of Shak&s;peare's celebrated Jew, and &s;ay to in&s;ulting foreigners, <Q>Hath not a Dutchman eyes? Hath not a Dutchman hands, organs, dimen&s;ions, &s;en&s;es, affections, pa&s;&s;ions? fed with the &s;ame food? hurt with the &s;ame weapons, &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es, healed by the &s;ame means, warmed and cooled by the &s;ame winter and &s;ummer, as an Engli&s;hman, French|man, or Spaniard is? If you prick him, does he not bleed? if you tickle him, does he not laugh? if you poi&s;on him, does he not die?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="157">And in good truth, when we perceive how very little the &s;pirit of candour influences one nation in its judgment of another, we may farther ju&s;tify the Venetian merchant in his ex|clamation&mdash;
<Q>"O Father Abraham, what the&s;e Chri&s;tians are!"</Q> &s;ince a very &s;mall proportion of Chri&s;tian cha|rity would lead us to &s;uppo&s;e,
<Q><L>"There may be &s;ome virtue,</L>
<L>"Ev'n among&s;t Saracens."</L></Q> What apology, then, &s;hall be found for men of travel, who not only bring over with them, but take back the narrowe&s;t prejudices again&s;t every other people? None can be offered; and we can only avoid cen&s;ure by &s;ilence&mdash;a &s;uffi|cient proof, you will allow, that I have not re|commended candour, without feeling its be|nign influence. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prince, Prince&s;s, and whole Hou&s;e of Orange, always attend the theatre, but without any pomp, and altogether as re|publicans. Indeed, the &s;ombrous a&s;pect of the playhou&s;e, from that almo&s;t univer&s;al com|plaint, want of light, gives them to the au|dience only in &s;hadow: there is, literally, but half a pound of candles to illume the royal box, and amid&s;t this darkne&s;s vi&s;ible, they &s;it &s;o much incog. as &s;carcely to be di&s;|tingui&s;hable from the chairs they &s;it on. Two maids of honour, and two pages form their playhou&s;e &s;uite, and they make their exits and their entrances with very few marks of a&s;&s;ent or di&s;approbation. Round the body of the hou&s;e are hung about a dozen reflecting lamps, which emit rather a glare than a plea&s;ant light. The &s;tage it&s;elf, however, is &s;ufficiently lumi|nous, which is certainly of the mo&s;t con&s;e|quence to that part of the audience who come to <HI>&s;ee;</HI> and I only mention it as a defect, as
<PB N="140" REF="159">it ob&s;cures tho&s;e who come to be <HI>&s;een.</HI> And Holland is by no means without its votaries, who wi&s;h to be admired; yea, and can boa&s;t its coquettes of both-&s;exes. Not that the&s;e make the theatre a frequent &s;cene of their vi&s;itation. It is rather &s;acred to a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> than a public exhibition, though it is more u&s;ually the re|&s;ort of people who go &s;imply to be amu&s;ed. Ju&s;t while I have opportunity, let me re&s;cue the characters of the Dutch beaux, (I will a&s;|&s;ure you "&s;uch things are") from the want of what would be looked upon in the city of Am|&s;terdam as at London, an unpardonable defi|ciency. Know then there are many fair ladies
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French fa&s;hion word for keeping.</NOTE> <HI>entreteniar'd</HI> in a very high &s;tyle of magnifi|cence. Many young Hollanders, yea and old ones too, are fa&s;hionable enough to have, and to take care it &s;hould be <HI>known</HI> that they have, a female of as great expence as beauty in their train, and all <HI>commercant</HI> as they are, contrive to &s;trike a bargain between bu&s;ine&s;s and plea|&s;ure, erecting a temple, as well to Venus as to Plutus. Some there are who, contented with the <HI>reputation</HI> of keeping the mi&s;tre&s;s, and the <HI>eclat</HI> of divorcing the wife, never vi&s;it the for|mer but in public, by way of <HI>exhibition;</HI> and though, by habit or pa&s;&s;ion, attached to the latter, dare not hazard the lo&s;s of character,
<PB N="141" REF="160">except by private interview, which, by taking the air of an intrigue, makes even a conjugal <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> as it were, by <HI>&s;tealth,</HI> at once dra|matick and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this general gloom of the play-hou&s;es, the Dutch, (albeit unu&s;ed to pay homage to mere rank or titles, of which there is abundance, the bulk of an audience being frequently compo&s;ed of the Repre&s;entatives of Emperors and Kings) are by no means in&s;en|&s;ible to merit, nor &s;low in affording it the warme&s;t tokens of their re&s;pect and admiration, a very &s;triking example of which I had an op|portunity of gleaning in their publick recep|tion of the Count de Boetzlaer, the gallant veteran who commanded, and &s;o bravely de|fended the fortre&s;s of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During the attack of Dumourier.</NOTE> William&s;tadt. I had the fortune to be pre&s;ent at the fir&s;t public appear|ance of this glorious and faithful &s;oldier, after his &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance, and other favouring circum&s;tances had driven back the French army into their own territories: and to grace his tri|umph, and render it more complete, it was at a time when another General was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been le&s;s &s;teady in the cau&s;e of his coun|try. The Count de Boetzlaer came late into the theatre, when a very affecting &s;cene in a
<PB N="142" REF="161">favourite tragedy, the chief character of which was performed by a popular actre&s;s, had very &s;trongly engaged the general attention, and when the entrance of all the Kings, Queens, or Potentates of the earth, under le&s;s powerful circum&s;tances, would have been thought a &s;e|condary attraction. But, in this in&s;tance, it was otherwi&s;e; and, for &s;everal minutes, the &s;tage, "and all that it inherits," was nothing worth. The Count came in, &s;upported by his two blooming daughters, each of whom had already been the well-&s;elected object of national gratitude, the States General, and the Stadt|holder having accorded them a very liberal pen&s;ion for life. Few things could have been a more flattering mark of their father's valour, than the&s;e rewards of his well-earned laurels; and yet I was near enough to <HI>&s;ee</HI> that the uni|ver&s;al &s;houts of a crowded theatre, among&s;t which were mingled the plaudits of the Prince, his family, and the Ladies, not of the Court only, but of every part of the hou&s;e, were cir|cum&s;tances of greater victory than their inde|pendence. Believe me, my friend, it was not a merely <HI>&s;entimental</HI> tear, which tender fancy had <HI>made</HI> for the occa&s;ion, but it was the ge|nuine drop of bli&s;s, derived from the fullne&s;s of the filial heart, that I actually ob&s;erved upon
<PB N="143" REF="162">the cheek of one of the daughters, and the other caught hold of the General's arm, and was hardly withheld by the forms of life, from embracing her father; and it was, as I &s;aid, a con&s;iderable time before the audience had any eyes, ears, or hands, for other entertainment. With re&s;pect to the General him&s;elf, without affecting to be elated beyond the due bound of a &s;en&s;ible mind, he received the incen&s;e thus offered him with a proper &s;en&s;e of what he owed to his own bravery, and to the publick, who were proud to di&s;tingui&s;h it. His exit from the theatre was more &s;plendid than his entrance, and I could not help making a re|flection, drawn from the place where it was &s;ugge&s;ted, the truth of which I will &s;ubmit to your deci&s;ion. The hero of the tragedy was a noble &s;oldier, whom the poet had drawn as de|&s;erving and receiving his country's applau&s;e, (whether on that night repre&s;ented in compli|ment to Boetzlaer I cannot tell;) the actor, who performed this part, was honoured, and ju&s;tly, with &s;trong tokens of publick favour, and, as he &s;eemed to ri&s;e in excellence, as he ro&s;e in fame, it is to be pre&s;umed his plea&s;ure was in proportion to his prai&s;e. The &s;ame, no doubt, was true as to the real General; but what an important difference, neverthele&s;s, in
<PB N="144" REF="163">the comparative feelings of the two per&s;onages, even as great as that betwixt fact and fancy; the &s;atisfaction of the actor being that of a man repre&s;enting, for the time being, the archieve|ments of another <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> character, mu&s;t have been tran&s;ient. When he had &s;trutted his hour out, there was an end of his glory, and even the acclamation, which his imitation excited, would give way to the fatigue of acting a long and laborious part, and he would &s;eek, in repo&s;e, a willing oblivion of his &s;hort-lived greatne&s;s, doomed, perhaps, on the morrow to a&s;&s;ume another character&mdash;the <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of that he played the night before&mdash;the vile&s;t tyrant or the meane&s;t &s;lave; and be the aver&s;ion of the very audience, who had &s;o lately wor&s;hipped him. The <HI>real</HI> General, on the contrary, I doubt not, returned home to a &s;eries of thoughts and emo|tions, which would be the &s;ame during the re|&s;idue of his life, and &s;weeten its late&s;t moments. He had repelled a foreign enemy, and awed a dome&s;tick foe. He had retired in the fulne&s;s of honour, and of years. He had received the ju&s;tice of the Republick for his &s;ervices in a period of its greate&s;t difficulty and danger. His children, his friends, his Prince, and "a whole nation's voice," informed him, what he had done was not followed by the pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="145" REF="164">glories of an evening, but that his name, his memory, the fortunes and the character of his family, would be trea&s;ured up among&s;t the proude&s;t archives of the Provinces.</P>
<P>On going to my hotel, I met with a very glean-worthy circum&s;tance. It had rained the whole of the evening, and might now be &s;aid to pour. I was a mile di&s;tant from that part of the Hague where I lodged, and I was then a &s;tranger to the town. A Dutoh gentleman, of whom I enquired my way, undertook to be my guide, with an air and voice of courte&s;y &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that in the dim &s;urvey I had of the per&s;on to whom they appertained, I took it for granted I &s;hould <HI>pay for the civility,</HI> and &s;o, without much ceremony, or compliment, ac|cepted it. My director was furni&s;hed with an umbrella, which he &s;hared with me, and held it over our heads. Still thinking I had en|countered a man, who would con&s;ider a few &s;ti|vers a &s;ufficient recompen&s;e for the &s;ervice, I &s;aid no hand&s;ome things on the occa&s;ion, and entered only into conver&s;ation about the weather. The violence of the rain continued, and even augmented, when, &s;o far from yield|ing any part of the benefit of the umbrella, I de&s;ired my guide to give me more than my
<PB N="146" REF="165">&s;hare, to which, very much to his annoyance, he a&s;&s;ented, by almo&s;t leaving his own per&s;on undefended. I felt &s;ome reproof of heart on this; but rather from a &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice, than any idea of rudene&s;s. We quickened our pace, and at length gained the point of my de&s;ti|nation, at the end of which the conductor would have made his bow, I find, and taken his leave, had I not &s;een the landlord at the door, who bowed to him with the mo&s;t pro|found re&s;pect, and begged him to walk in till the &s;hower was over, or at lea&s;t to accept of a great coat, of which offer, having availed him&s;elf, he renewed his farewel, and left me, with the be&s;t nature imaginable, to &s;ettle my behaviour as I could.&mdash;I now perceived I had been indebted to a gentleman of one of the fir&s;t families in Holland for this urbanity, who, &s;eeing me a&s;tray, and benighted in a &s;trange land, walked through a tempe&s;t to guide me on my way, and looking upon me, no doubt, as a &s;tranger, ignorant of cu&s;toms, pa&s;&s;ed over my incivility, without relaxing his own kind|ne&s;s. He was di&s;covered to me ju&s;t in time to prevent receiving from me the in&s;ult of a couple of <HI>&s;e&s;thalfs,</HI> which I &s;hould have thought, deeming him the per&s;on I had at fir&s;t
<PB N="147" REF="166">dubbed him, an hand&s;ome gratuity, <HI>as money goes in Holland,</HI> for a good wetting.</P>
<P>You are too penetrating not to &s;ee, that I have detailed this nocturnal adventure, which you have, ju&s;t as it happened, to &s;ome better end than telling a tale. I wi&s;h it to &s;erve as introductory to my vindication of the Dutch, from another ill-grounded charge, brought by neighbouring nations again&s;t them, <HI>viz.</HI> their imputed want of urbanity to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I am aware, my loved friend, that it would be as <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to make <HI>you,</HI> as it would be <HI>difficult,</HI> to make the bulk of my hone&s;t countrymen believe, that the current civilities are &s;hewn to foreigners in general, and Engli&s;hmen in par|ticular, with a liberality worthy the adoption of people&mdash;(their cen&s;urers for in&s;tance)&mdash;who have more <HI>reputation</HI> for tho&s;e curte&s;ies which &s;mooth the path of the traveller, and far le&s;s hone&s;t claim. But, from a citizen of the world, and a man of a candid &s;pirit, we ex|pect and find better things. We ea&s;ily credit others for tho&s;e virtues which form a part of our own character; we are even apt to &s;uppo&s;e them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, where they really are not&mdash;ju&s;t as we impute our favourite foibles to our

<P>The &s;ingle example I have recited above, did it &s;tand alone in the travels of an indi|vidual, would, or ought to be, &s;ufficient to re&s;|cue the nation from the &s;tigma under which they labour.&mdash;But, among&s;t the Dutch, did every traveller tell <HI>all</HI> the truth, he mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that the little urbanities he met with in a tour through the provinces, (were he not him&s;elf too proud or too churli&s;h to accept gentle offices) afforded him not <HI>Gleanings</HI> only, but a rea&s;onable harve&s;t; and yet &s;o genial is the &s;oil, this barren &s;oil, &s;aid to be unfruitful of every thing but what is &s;old, and &s;old on u&s;ury, that every new gue&s;t may, if he pro|perly cultivates it, go "filled with good things," away.</P>
<P>In my own ca&s;e, I by no means rely on the &s;olitary in&s;tance with which I have pre&s;ented you. It is a&s;&s;ociated with many others, where frequently "I turn the leaf of gratitude" to read them. Accept one or two more. I had lo&s;t my|&s;elf in following my mental, rather than my cor|poreal eye&mdash;no uncommon event in this world.
<PB N="149" REF="168">I was arou&s;ed from my reverie in a part of Holland, which exactly an&s;wered to a line of Gold&s;mith's Hermit&mdash;it was
<Q>"Where wilds immea&s;urably &s;pread;"</Q> and I was half buried in a bog before I di&s;co|vered this. On looking round, I perceived a mill at about fifty paces di&s;tant, and a man running down the ladder, and then making towards me with his utmo&s;t &s;peed, calling out, and making &s;igns for me to attempt no farther my own extrication. This, as I afterwards found, was a very nece&s;&s;ary caution, for my plunging involved me yet deeper in the bog; and when the almo&s;t breathle&s;s miller came to my aid, I literally ro&s;e
<Q>"in all the maje&s;ty of mud."</Q></P>
<P>My pre&s;erver informed me, I had got into a country where the &s;olid and rotten ground were &s;o mixed, that it had been the grave of men and bea&s;ts time immemorial, and that even a per&s;on, born among&s;t the&s;e treacherous quagmires, found it &s;ometimes difficult to pa&s;s them in &s;afety. With great good-nature he conducted me to a &s;ecure path which led to the village from whence I had rambled; but to effect this was a walk of more than twenty
<PB N="150" REF="169">minutes; and &s;eeing &s;ome long gra&s;s growing be&s;ide a dyke we had to go over, he plucked a copious handful, and made me a little more fit to enter the abode of human beings. When the town-gate appeared before me in a direct line, he bid me farewel, and went back to his mill.</P>
<P>During the whole of this &s;cene, I believe, my pre&s;erver did not &s;peak more than twice&mdash;once to warn me of my danger, and once to bid me adieu, when he had got me out of it. Could the fo&s;ter courte&s;y of more poli&s;hed nations have better effected di&s;intere&s;ted good will?</P>
<P>And the &s;econd &s;ervice was like unto the fir&s;t. It happened at the little village of Scheveling. I had u&s;ed all my paper, to wrap up my Gleanings, and a morning's excur&s;ion had crouded my mind with fre&s;h matter. Not a &s;crap of paper remained, &s;ave the backs of two letters, which I had loaded to the very edges. My heart is very faithful to its feelings, but the <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of them always &s;uffers, if I tru&s;t long to my memory.&mdash;It is hence that I have ever been de&s;irous to write "warm from that heart," becau&s;e, then it is, that my pen is "faithful to its fires."&mdash;What was to
<PB N="151" REF="170">be done?&mdash;My landlord had not a &s;ingle &s;heet of paper in the hou&s;e. I re&s;orted to the only &s;hop in the village, where there was any hope of my want being &s;upplied. Could any thing be &s;o unlucky? he was out of paper; but ex|pected &s;ome from the Hague in the evening! E'er that, perchance, the images which are now &s;o lively, will be lo&s;t among&s;t other oc|currences, and "leave not a trace behind." I <HI>thought</HI> this, and the little &s;hopkeeper &s;eemed to tran&s;late that thought; for running up &s;tairs, and returning with the &s;ame &s;peed, after hav|ing ha&s;tily &s;aid&mdash;I no doubt wanted to write a letter to &s;ome friend by the po&s;t of the day&mdash; he pre&s;ented me with a whole quire, which, he told me, had been put up in his &s;on's box, to go with him back to &s;chool after the holi|days; but to accommodate you, Sir, &s;aid the father, a &s;heet or two, more or le&s;s, is of no con&s;equence. He &s;hewed me into a little &s;itting-room at the end of his &s;hop, furni&s;hed me with a new pen, &s;ome good ink, opened a bureau, placed me a chair, and, taking out his watch, told me I had barely half an hour before the po&s;tman would &s;et off, he &s;hut the door, de&s;iring me, as he clo&s;ed it between us, to make the be&s;t u&s;e of my time.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="171">Though I was really not in &s;o violent a hurry, I thought it would be a di&s;appointment to the hone&s;t man not to profit of his urbanity, which I therefore did, in a two-fold manner; fir&s;t, by writing down the heads of tho&s;e things which I had <HI>gleaned;</HI> and, &s;econdly, making a memorandum of the urbanity it&s;elf, as a ju&s;t object of future <HI>gleaning;</HI> and the better to gratify mine ho&s;t, (for when a kind|ne&s;s is intended, one likes to give it its whole weight in the &s;cale of gratitude) I folded up my ob&s;ervations in the form of a letter, which I appeared to have ju&s;t fini&s;hed as the &s;hop|keeper came in to apprize me he heard the po&s;t-horn, offering, at the &s;ame time, to &s;tep with it <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> Bowing only, as an an&s;wer to this, I laid a two &s;tiver piece on the counter; but the good man in&s;i&s;ted on my not paying for a &s;heet or two of paper, which was properly his &s;on's, and could not be &s;old&mdash;you are a &s;tranger (&s;aid the father) and though I keep a &s;hop, I know what belongs to the &s;tranger; and I hope this boy (&s;peaking to his &s;on, who now came in from his diver&s;ions) will do the &s;ame&mdash;Peter (added the father) I have given this gentleman &s;ome of your paper, becau&s;e he wanted to write a letter to a friend&mdash;take off

<P>Should there be any of my readers, who&s;e lofty thoughts out&s;oar this humble benevolence, let them be taught, that the violet which flings its fragrance from the valley, is &s;ome|times &s;weeter than the perfume of the cedar, and that a &s;till, &s;mall, action, like that of the poor Scheveling &s;hopkeeper, in his gift of the &s;heet of paper, marks the bounty of the indi|vidual donor, and ought to &s;erve as a trait of national ho&s;pitality, no le&s;s, truly, than the mo&s;t o&s;ten&s;ible deed that the courtly Hague it&s;elf has to boa&s;t.&mdash;It is neither the giver nor the gift, my friend, but the manner and motive that &s;hould determine its value, as well as the richne&s;s or poverty of the <HI>&s;oul</HI> from whence it proceeds.</P>
<P>But, if any of the &s;aid <HI>&s;ublime</HI> readers de&s;ire to have a proof of Dutch urbanity drawn from higher life, I can accommodate him even there, and will a&s;k his opinion of that merchant's
<PB N="154" REF="173">heart, which, in a mere dealing of money, could act its part in the following ca&s;e:</P>
<P>A. is in Holland, and di&s;appointed of remit|tances: B. a <HI>Dutch</HI> merchant, (to whom he introduces <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as an Engli&s;h gentleman) offers to &s;upply him with what may be wanted. A. draws a bill on the &s;aid B. for 50 l. on London: B. even before its acceptance, or knowing whether it be good, or good for no|thing, de&s;ires A. may take its amount, <HI>en ar|gent comptant.</HI>&mdash;This is, at fir&s;t, declined, and, afterwards, accepted in part; for the bill, through an accident, is left unpaid &s;ome weeks. A. unable to account for the demur, apolo|gizes. B. an&s;wers by &s;ending one of his clerks with the whole fifty pounds, a&s;&s;erting confi|dently that the delay mu&s;t have been unavoid|able. The delay however continues, and B. &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in his offers, A. almo&s;t trem|blingly, receives a quarter of the bill. An|other fortnight's &s;ilence en&s;ues.&mdash;A. is per|plexed; but though living at the time out of the merchant's &s;ight, B. neither calls, or &s;ends, about the money. The per&s;on who &s;hould have honoured it recovers from a violent in|di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="155" REF="174">and the bill is paid. The mer|chant &s;ends word of this; and in&s;tead of pay|ing only the balance, would have withheld his own claim, to a future better convenience, had it been nece&s;&s;ary; on calling upon him to take leave, A. could not but expre&s;s very &s;trongly his &s;en&s;e of his candour. He &s;aid it was his duty.</P>
<P>Tell me, ye &s;ticklers for <HI>Old England,</HI> could the mo&s;t liberal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> merchant deport him|&s;elf more generou&s;ly towards any &s;tranger &s;o circum&s;tanced? and to be quite hone&s;t, &s;ay, would not the majority think they did full enough, by paying the ca&s;h, when they re|ceived advice the equivalent was &s;afe with their corre&s;pondent abroad? And, in the way of trade, &s;uch, indeed, would be fair dealing; but let us &s;tep a little beyond the <HI>laws of the ledger and counting-hou&s;e,</HI> to relieve "the &s;tranger that is within our gates," at lea&s;t, if indi&s;po&s;ed to "do as we have been done by," in like ca&s;es, let us admit, that the &s;everal good offices, here recorded, ought to &s;et down the people of Holland, (in place of what they HAVE been &s;et down), a kind-hearted and obliging race, neither avaricious, u&s;urious, or
<PB N="156" REF="175">cold, where it behoves them to &s;hew that they are men.</P>
<P>In contra&s;t to the impo&s;itions of the Schevel|ing landlord, who charged me the price of a &s;umptuous entertainment, for my &s;hrimps and milk, as related in a former letter, I promi&s;ed you, I think, an account of better report, in the conduct of my <HI>other</HI> landlord of the &s;ame village. This is the preci&s;e place for it, and will, aptly, bring to a period, the&s;e little vindi|cations of a nation that ought to fill a greater &s;pace in the map of philanthropy.</P>
<P>At the time I warned you of the knavi&s;h part that was played upon me, at the Heeren Logement, you may remember, I glanced at the excellent behaviour of a publican, who&s;e hou&s;e I &s;hould, therefore, very &s;trongly recommend to the Briti&s;h pa&s;&s;enger, as well in compatrioti&s;m to the one, as ju&s;tice to the other.</P>
<P>The name of this publican is MULY, at who&s;e plea&s;ant hou&s;e, I went <HI>perfectly un|known,</HI> and as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> con&s;equently &s;up|po&s;ed to be able, and probably willing, (&s;uch
<PB N="157" REF="176">is the general rea&s;oning) to bear any impo&s;ing extravagancy. I had, moreover, the thought|le&s;sne&s;s to follow my &s;eelings, rather than my intere&s;t, by running into a rhap&s;ody on the beauty of the &s;ituation, the goodne&s;s of the air, the neathe&s;s of the apartment, &amp;c. thereby giving him the hint, to make me pay for my being <HI>&s;o well plea&s;ed.</HI> But none of the&s;e temp|tations, allured him into exaction. That he might want, however, no encouragements I could give him, I addre&s;&s;ed him to this effect. <Q>I wi&s;h, friend, to be furni&s;hed with board and lodging, with the advantage of be|ing near the &s;ea; you, and your hou&s;e equally plea&s;e me:&mdash;I like to live well, but without parade; I hate trouble, &s;o mu&s;t look to you, and your family for every accommodation&mdash;what mu&s;t I give you per week?</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t con&s;ult my wife, quoth the publican; and making his bow, di&s;appeared. While the hu&s;band, and his helpmate, were laying their heads together, to make, as one would have thought, <HI>the mo&s;t of me,</HI> in driving a good bargain, I did, what I &s;uppo&s;e, is the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="158" REF="177">of every man in the &s;ame &s;ituation; anticipated the demand, which I &s;uppo&s;ed would be made. Forming my judgment on &s;ome experience, and ALLOWING for a certain mea&s;ure of cheat|ing, as a matter of cour&s;e, I made my e&s;timate, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, very little in favor of the peo|ple, with whom I was about to deal; in which calculation I injured them, and &s;hould have done better, had I acted up to the good old principle; "think every man hone&s;t till you find him a rogue," in&s;tead of inverting the maxim. Sir, &s;aid my landlord on returning, we have determined that to give you con|tent in your breakfa&s;t, dinner, and &s;upper, your tea in an afternoon, a good &s;leeping, and a good &s;itting room; we cannot re|ceive a le&s;s &s;um than twelve florins; it is a great deal of money to be &s;ure, Sir, but we know how an Engli&s;hman &s;hould be &s;erved, and fear, therefore, without lo&s;s to our&s;elves, we could not make our demand more rea&s;onable. Stop, however, a moment, if you plea&s;e, Sir.</P>
<P>He now ran down to his fellow councellor, a &s;econd time, leaving me to reproach my&s;elf, for having thought wor&s;e of him than he de|&s;erved; but then, &s;aid I, by way of making
<PB N="159" REF="178">my peace with my&s;elf, it mu&s;t be &s;till con|fe&s;&s;ed that "for a man to be hone&s;t as this world goes, is to be one picked out of a thou|&s;and;" at lea&s;t, if he be a publican, and the per&s;on, with whom I am now in treaty, is ra|ther to be con&s;idered as an exception than a general rule.</P>
<P>While I was thus &s;oftening away my own errour of judgement, my landlord came back to &s;ay, that the only alteration he <HI>could</HI> make in his original charge, would be to deduct &s;o much per breakfa&s;t, dinner, or &s;upper, or per day, or night, provided I was ab&s;ent at any, or all of the&s;e in my excur&s;ions to the Hague, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have often felt, that the high plea&s;ure we derive from the worthy conduct of another, is not &s;o much for the individual <HI>advantage,</HI> that occurs from it, as from the gratifying &s;en&s;e we have of whatever redounds to the honour, or elevation of human nature. Surely, therefore, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> impre&s;&s;ion of delight is <HI>not</HI> &s;elfi&s;h, but &s;ocial; and all the &s;ubtlety of Rochfaucault, cannot over&s;et this impregnable truth, any more than that which contra&s;ts it; namely,
<PB N="160" REF="179">that the pain we undergo on witne&s;&s;ing any mean, or atrocious, behaviour, proceeds, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, rather from the due &s;ympathy and re&s;pect we have for the degradation of humanity, than for the per&s;onal di&s;credit it reflects on our&s;elves. Man, is very &s;ublimely placed in the &s;cale of created beings, and he appears to drop below the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of his &s;pecies, when he acts beneath the augu&s;t idea he has been taught to look up to as the chief glory of him&s;elf, as a rational creature, and of his Creator. However fal&s;e or corrupt, &s;ays a noble author, the human mind be within it&s;elf, it finds the difference as to beauty, between one heart and another, and accordingly, in all oa&s;es, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> approve, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, what is natural and hone&s;t, and di&s;approve of what is di&s;hone&s;t and corrupt. Pardon me for deducing &s;o grave a reflection from &s;o, apparently, &s;light an occa|&s;ion; but, the great cau&s;e of morality is con|nected with the minute&s;t parts of character and conduct; ju&s;t as the ocean is dependent on the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable &s;tream that runs into its embraces. It is, indeed, the drops that <HI>form</HI> that ocean, immen&s;e as is the one, and &s;mall as are the other, and virtue is con&s;tituted in like
<PB N="161" REF="180">manner of <HI>&s;eemingly</HI> in&s;ignificant parts collected into a whole.</P>
<P>From this after thought of my landlord, or as he is in the Dutch language, called Ca&s;teline, I could derive but a very trifling benefit, even were I to take my bed and board in other places, twice or thrice in the week; but I was more touched with the unque&s;tionable inte|grity of the propo&s;al, than if he had lodged and &s;erved me for nothing. I told him I was perfectly &s;atisfied; and would con&s;ider my&s;elf as his gue&s;t <HI>from that very hour.</HI></P>
<P>Every other part of this man's conduct was uniform, and I lived with him in perfect good will. The whole range of his hou&s;e was ac|corded to me; when tea drinking parties, too much &s;un, or wind, vi&s;ited one apartment, I &s;hifted to another. My bed and table would, con&s;idering time and place, (I mean the &s;ea &s;ide, and the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on), have warranted treble the charge at any town or village in England. My bad Dutch was interpreted in the be&s;t, as well as be&s;t <HI>natured,</HI> manner: my very looks became language; and the &s;ervants, who u&s;ually take the bent of their behaviour from their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, contributed
<PB N="162" REF="181">all in their power to make my &s;ituation de|lightful. And &s;o it would have been, had my health permitted; but even my &s;ickne&s;s found, from the di&s;po&s;itional kindne&s;s of this man, and of his family, numberle&s;s con&s;olements. With|out a&s;king, they admini&s;tered what they &s;up|po&s;ed would do me good&mdash;the be&s;t fruits, ve|getables, &amp;c. The richer fi&s;h&mdash;&s;uch as &s;al|mon, carp, turbot, &amp;c. which daily came from the &s;ea to my table, while I was in an apparent &s;tate to reli&s;h them, were now changed for &s;melts, and other &s;imple dwellers of the ocean. So of meats&mdash;there was the &s;ame friendly di&s;tinction in my de&s;ert, which, in my health, con&s;i&s;ted of dried fruits, con&s;erves, &amp;c. but in my &s;ickne&s;s, of &s;trawberries, and other delicacies, which at that period of the year, and in the <HI>Hague market,</HI> from whence they were brought, mu&s;t have co&s;t more than the price I gave could ju&s;tify. And &s;o far from tireing of this conduct, it went on from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t hour of my re&s;idence, without intermi&s;&s;ion; and I am convinced would have done &s;o for a twelvemonth together, had it &s;uited me to have remained a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>You would have been much amu&s;ed, as I was, to hear the good man of the hou&s;e, labouring at
<PB N="163" REF="182">my meanings, and calling in not only his wife and &s;ervants, but that of any other per&s;on who might be taking refre&s;hment, as auxiliaries. The Engli&s;h <HI>heer,</HI> (gentleman) he would &s;ay, mu&s;t certainly mean &s;uch, or &s;uch a thing. He would then repeat my bad Dutch; the com|ments of the company on which, were &s;ome|times pretty curious: according to the different con&s;tructions, the hone&s;t fellow has come up fir&s;t with the &s;ubject of one interpretation then another; &s;miling only at the frequent mi&s;|takes in the tran&s;lations, and &s;haring in an hearty laugh, which was choru&s;ed by his friends below &s;tairs, when the thing de&s;ired has been hit upon.</P>
<P>All this, you mu&s;t own, demon&s;trates the perfection of good will, as well as of good na|ture, and I did not take leave of the authors of it, without wi&s;hing the entertainment I had found, as well for the body as the mind, might be enjoyed by other travellers on the road of life, which &s;uch as have lei&s;ure and inclination to vi&s;it, or &s;ojourn with my friend and cor|re&s;pondent a&s;&s;uredly will: to which end, no le&s;s than to di&s;charge a debt of gratitude and equity, I have pre&s;ented you and the public with this <HI>Gleaning,</HI> and with which al&s;o, I &s;hall terminate my letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>PUBLIC ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered, I be|lieve, in the Provinces, with a very impartial, but, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a very my&s;terious hand. In common affairs, the accu&s;ed is tried, and if not immediately acquitted, he is reconducted to his pri&s;on, without knowing when his &s;en|tence will be pa&s;&s;ed, or of what nature it is to be. At the plea&s;ure of the magi&s;trates, he is &s;ummoned to make his &s;econd appearance, and then receives &s;entence: after the hearing which, he is carried again to his confinement, from whence he is brought out only on the day it is to be executed: of this, he has only a few hours notice, whether the puni&s;hment be capi|tal, or otherwi&s;e. He is then delivered over as a public &s;pectacle, and his offence made known, in a &s;ummary way, to the people.</P>
<P>The &s;tate trials are conducted with great &s;ecre&s;y. A <HI>marked</HI> per&s;on is picked up, in a manner, almo&s;t imperceptibly. He is tried, condemned, and executed, without the public
<PB N="165" REF="184">&s;u&s;pecting any thing of the matter. If the offender be a per&s;on of de&s;cent, who&s;e family would be di&s;graced by an ignominious death, he is brought into a certain apartment in the &s;eats of ju&s;tice, where he perceives a goblet &s;tanding on a table; and on one &s;ide of it the figure of a woman, called the MAIDEN, larger than life; but of exqui&s;ite beauty and proportion: the per&s;on who&s;e office it is to attend, gives the criminal the choice of the&s;e, either of which is an inevitable fate. If to drink the contents of the goblet be his election, he has no &s;ooner taken the potion, than the officer makes him a bow, and informs him he is at full liberty to go where he plea&s;es. Of cour&s;e he makes the be&s;t of his way home; but the poi&s;on he has &s;wallowed is of &s;o active a nature, that he takes his death along with him; and has no other con&s;olation, than that of yielding up his life amid&s;t his friends. If the other be his choice, he advances to the figure, who&s;e arms are, by &s;ecret &s;prings, extended to receive him; and ju&s;t as he has reached the lips of this treacher|ous MAIDEN, he finds de&s;truction in her em|brace; he is locked fa&s;t in her gripe, and feels innumerable lancets &s;triking at his heart and vitals.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="185">An involuntary horrour &s;eized me at the re|lation of this figure; not becau&s;e I deem, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, a &s;udden death &s;o terrible as the apparatus and &s;hame of a public execution, but as it is abundantly more aweful. I, likewi&s;e, regretted that this formidable in&s;trument of ju&s;tice &s;hould be repre&s;ented under the form of a beautiful <HI>female.</HI> Although it &s;truck me, afterwards, as a pretty clo&s;e &s;ymbol of the un&s;u&s;pected mi&s;chiefs, which are in|&s;idiou&s;ly &s;tored up by that faithle&s;s part of the &s;ex, who convey, even with their endear|ments, a dagger into the heart; more perni|cious in its effects, though more &s;low, than the lancets of the MAIDEN, or venom of the GOBLET.</P>
<P>I will embrace this opportunity of offering you a few Gleanings re&s;pecting the govern|ment of Holland, as well as of the provinces that appertain to it; from whence, I tru&s;t, you will acquire a competent general idea of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, of which I have given you the above particular in&s;tance.

<PB N="167" REF="186">or totally to &s;ubvert that government, and that ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Before the &s;even Provinces, which are the ob|jects of our con&s;ideration, acceded to the union of Utrecht, they were under the government of their particular States. Although the e&s;&s;ential parts of the government are &s;till the &s;ame, there is &s;ome variation in the form. Agreeable to the primitive order e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Low Coun|tries, the States of each province acknowledged a &s;overeign; but the union above-mentioned totally aboli&s;hed monarchy in the Seven Pro|vinces. According to the ancient &s;y&s;tem, the States were compo&s;ed of the three orders fol|lowing,&mdash;the clergy, nobility, and the people, repre&s;ented by the deputies of each town. But the Calvini&s;tical religion no &s;ooner became predominant, than the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order was excluded from any rank in the States; the power of the nobles was greatly dimini&s;hed, and the principal &s;hare of the authority devolved on the people; an arrangement which cut up the kingly power by the root: pre&s;ently the government became &s;ub&s;tantially democratic, retaining, neverthele&s;s, the &s;hadow of ari&s;to|cracy. At pre&s;ent the government of the
<PB N="168" REF="187">whole Republic is &s;aid to be ve&s;ted in the States-General and under them, the Council of State.</P>
<P>The&s;e Provinces form, therefore, one Re|public, which is thus governed; the States of Guelderland have the fir&s;t voice, tho&s;e of Holland the &s;econd, of Zealand the third, of Utrecht the fourth, of Friezland the fifth, of Overy&s;&s;el the &s;ixth, and of Groningen the &s;eventh. All the authors who have written on their polity, agree, that they &s;end as many de|puties as they plea&s;e to the States-General, but the deputies of each Province have but one voice; and each pre&s;ides weekly in its turn in order to maintain its re&s;pective equality. The per&s;on be&s;t qualified is cho&s;en pre&s;ident, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> out of the deputies, as was ob&s;erved, of each province. This a&s;&s;embly, &s;ays Carter, declares war, makes peace, gives audience to foreign mini&s;ters, and nominates amba&s;&s;adors to the &s;everal courts of Europe; but none of the&s;e things are done, till the deputies have fir&s;t con&s;ulted the &s;tates of their different Provinces, and received their order.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the nece&s;&s;ity of thus waiting for unanimous con&s;ent to every
<PB N="169" REF="188">mea&s;ure, frequently cau&s;es an inconvenient de|lay in the progre&s;s, and conclu&s;ion of what calls for di&s;patch; e&s;pecially as the demur, or di&s;&s;ent, of any one Province, however incon&s;iderable, is &s;ufficient to put a &s;top to the mo&s;t important affairs; even though the fafety of the whole Re|public was depending. If we con&s;ider that there are no le&s;s than &s;ix and fifty towns in the Seven Provinces, who&s;e &s;anction is to be ob|tained; be&s;ides that of the nobles, di&s;per&s;ed at unequal di&s;tances; and that each of the&s;e towns has a right to &s;end any given number of de|puties, we &s;hall not &s;o much wonder at the tar|dine&s;s of a Dutch negociation, as that it is <HI>ever brought to a conclu&s;ion.</HI> Their treaty of Treves, for in&s;tance, with the Arch-Duke Albert, was impeded till no le&s;s than eight hundred de|puties had performed their mi&s;&s;ion. Yet there is &s;o much &s;tre&s;s laid on this priviledge, that the States-General them&s;elves, can neither make peace, or declare war; nor put an end to the mo&s;t trifling treaty with foreign powers, till every nece&s;&s;ary and unnece&s;&s;ary doubt is removed in the &s;everal Provinces; whether the object of government be to rai&s;e men or money, to make laws or regulations, the people mu&s;t be <HI>all of one mind.</HI> The member who &s;hould pre&s;ume to act on his own un&s;upported
<PB N="170" REF="189">judgement, would, unque&s;tionably, fall a victim to his temerity. Sir William Temple ob&s;erves, that this fundamental article was never vio|lated, except in 1688, when he him&s;elf pre|vailed on the States-General, to conclude <HI>three treaties in five days,</HI> without having recour&s;e to the Provinces: But this was for the pre&s;erva|tion of Flanders, when much of it had been conquered by France, and being looked on as an indi&s;pen&s;ible mea&s;ure of &s;tate <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> re|ceived the thanks of every Province; though had any one di&s;approved it as a daring breach of priviledge, the States-General mu&s;t have paid the forfeit with their heads; &s;o that, it is with great propriety, this a&s;&s;embly, which is called &s;overeign, only <HI>repre&s;ents</HI> the &s;overeignty, and e&s;&s;entially differs from the parliament of Great Britain, of which the members are in a manner principals, and may act independently in the counties that deputed them; their only puni&s;hment, when <HI>they</HI> act uncon&s;titutionally being the di&s;grace they &s;uffer on the part of their con&s;tituents, or being thrown out at the next election. Our happier legi&s;lation, in this point, admits of more &s;peedy deci&s;ions. Not that this &s;low method of proceeding in the Republic is without &s;ome advantages. It af|fords full lei&s;ure for deliberation and for cau|tion,
<PB N="171" REF="190">as one of its advocates has remarked, and it is, &s;ometimes, a very good pretext for gain|ing time, and waiting events.</P>
<P>The council of State is compo&s;ed of deputies, which a&s;&s;i&s;t in the name of each Province. It is this council which regulates military affairs, and finance. Here the Trea&s;urer General and a deputy from the nobility have a &s;eat and voice. It al&s;o puts the re&s;olutions of the States General, and propo&s;es to them the mo&s;t expedient means for rai&s;ing troops and money: gives out pa&s;s|ports, di&s;po&s;es of the revenues, &s;uperintends the army, works, and fortre&s;&s;es, as al&s;o, the go|vernment, and affairs of all the conquered places in Flanders and Brabant. Towards the end of every year, this council form an e&s;timate of the expences they think nece&s;&s;ary for the year following; the money for defraying which is rai&s;ed by quotas, in the proportion, as an approved writer informs us, of aliquot parts of one hundred pounds &s;terling; and, it &s;eems, there has not been any alteration made in the quotas, of the &s;everal Provinces, &s;ince the year 1668. From that date to this, before us, they have &s;tood thus:

<P>To the&s;e two &s;overeign councils of the Re|public, may be added a third, that of the Ad|miralty, which is &s;ubdivided into five courts; each of which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even deputies. Great Britain has but one Court of Admiralty; the maritime Provinces of the Republic, have each of them one, as a mark of their &s;overeignty, and, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, of their independency of each other; and yet all the&s;e &s;overeignties and independencies mu&s;t, like &s;o many links, be clo&s;e riveted by uncompelled connection, form|ing one &s;olid political chain, before either civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or religious affairs can be effective. Hence it is evident, &s;ays one of their mo&s;t partial <HI>admirers,</HI> that the real &s;overeignty of the commonwealth re&s;ts, where one would lea&s;t expect to find it; that is, neither in the States General, nor Provincial; but in the town or people. This has been deemed, and, perhaps, ju&s;tly, an <HI>enormous defect</HI> in their con|&s;titution; for, at pre&s;ent, the corruption, or perver&s;ene&s;s of any one &s;mall town may put
<PB N="173" REF="192">public affairs into great and even fatal di&s;order. The Seven Provinces, therefore, are, in effect, my friend, &s;o many little Republics. The Bur|go-ma&s;ters, and Senate, compo&s;e the &s;o|vereignty; and on a vacancy by death, a Burgo|ma&s;ter, would be highly offended if any petty burgher, pre&s;umed to murmur at his filling it up with one of his own &s;ons, relations, or friends: and &s;o great is the awe of the magi|&s;trate in this imputed <HI>free</HI> country, that the citizens, either in their private, or collective capacities, do not care to hazard any innova|tions; &s;o that the boa&s;ted liberty of the Dutch is not to be under&s;tood in the general and ab|&s;olute &s;en&s;e, but <HI>cum grano &s;alis;</HI> and Carter, has, therefore, well called it, not a Common|wealth, but a <HI>confederacy</HI> of &s;even &s;overeign powers, for their mutual defence; leagued to|gether by provincial compacts for their com|mon intere&s;t and &s;ecurity. The &s;ame writer ob&s;erves, that this Republican confederacy has a near re&s;emblance to the Archaean League, which, you know, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal little in|dependent &s;tates and cities allied together for general &s;afety. Each of them had been govern|ed by &s;ingle per&s;ons, who having abu&s;ed their power, were degraded and exiled. Tho&s;e cities then formed them&s;elves into &s;o many
<PB N="174" REF="193">Common-wealths, and entered into a league to &s;trengthen them&s;elves. This new &s;tate, which had, at lea&s;t, the face of liberty, became the common a&s;ylum of its neighbours, and im|mediately grew rich, powerful, and populous. They had a fixed place, where the deputies of the cities a&s;&s;embled to deliberate on the affairs of the league. They al&s;o cho&s;e a chief, whom they called Praetor; who governed conform|ably to the re&s;olutions taken in the a&s;&s;embly of the allies, and was, at that time, their Captain|General. Their Praetor, indeed, was only an|nual; in which &s;ingle circum&s;tance, the re|&s;emblance between the Confederate States of Greece, and the United Provinces, does not hold good; the office and authority of the Stadtholder, (the Captain-General of this Republic) being perpetual and hereditary. Which ob&s;ervation brings me to the place, where it may be proper to &s;ay &s;omething of the Stadtholderate.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the early propen&s;ity which the Dutch di&s;covered for a democratic form of government, they inclined to <HI>blend with it</HI> &s;ome|thing of monarchy. This was manife&s;ted by their voluntary creation of the Stadtholders, who, though not altogether inve&s;ted with &s;o|vereign power, were entru&s;ted with no incon|&s;iderable
<PB N="175" REF="194">&s;hare of authority. The power of this chief magi&s;trate is at once limited and ex|ten&s;ive; and he was originally cho&s;en by the people, and placed at their head on this maxim of their &s;tate, which pa&s;&s;ed into a &s;olemn and unanimous declaration in 1672&mdash;we <HI>feel fully convinced we are in want of a centre of union, that may give grace, &s;trength, and harmony to our Con&s;titution:</HI> and, accordingly, in the year 1747, Charles Henry Fri&s;o, who had been cho&s;en by the people of Guelderland, under the name of William the Fourth, was appointed Stadt|holder of the Seven Provinces, and the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion made hereditary in his family.</P>
<P>The functions and priviledges a&s;&s;igned to this great officer of the Republic were origi|nally from the States-General, and the Pro|vinces. He enjoys the title and power of a Captain-General, and Admiral, of all the forces of the Republic by &s;ea and by land. The States of Holland, ob&s;erves a very able writer on the Revolution of 1787, having declared that the Republic <HI>cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor is there <HI>any</HI> Republic on earth; which can call that chief King, Pre&s;ident, Protector, or what el&s;e you will. 'Tis ju&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary as the head to the body.</NOTE> without a chief, we are, it &s;eems, to con&s;ider the Stadtholder, as an e&s;&s;ential part of the con&s;titution; and
<PB N="176" REF="195">that he is not an immaterial part of it, will appear by an enumeration of his priviledges.</P>
<P>In Guelderland, Holland, and Utrecht, he participates the &s;overeignty, as pre&s;ident of their bodies of nobles; and in Zealand, as the only noble of the Province; and he has a right of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, though not of voting, at the delibe|rations of the States-General. In his executive capacity, he is principal member of the Coun|cil of State, which, in military affairs, is almo&s;t entirely under his direction. He pre&s;ides in all courts of ju&s;tice; and has a right of par|doning criminals. He di&s;po&s;es of the <HI>patents,</HI> or written orders, for marching the troops, although the&s;e patents ought to be accom|panied by what is called a <HI>Lettre d'Attache,</HI> or permi&s;&s;ion from the towns, through which the troops are to march. He has the means of &s;ta|tioning the army as he plea&s;es. He publi&s;hes all military ordinances, he names all Colonels and inferior officers, by virtue of the right which was made over to him from the differ|ent Provinces; and, as the &s;uperior officers are con&s;tantly appointed by the States-General, in conformity to his wi&s;hes, he virtually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the <HI>whole patronage of the army.</HI> He names all Vice-Admirals, and Captains of the navy,
<PB N="177" REF="196">in&s;titutes all Court-Martials, and pre&s;ides in the different Admiralties.</P>
<P>In the three Provinces, <HI>aux Reglemens,</HI> he ap|points to all offices whatever; and in Holland and Zealand, he annually elects the greater part of the magi&s;trates, from a double number of candidates, pre&s;ented by the towns. He choo&s;es from a nomination of three candidates, every officer in the department of the States of Holland, and of their chamber of accounts, and all the members of the College of the Heem|raden, or &s;uperintendants of the dykes. He di&s;po&s;es of all the po&s;ts in the nomination of the Council of State, and of the Council of Deputies. He is Governor-General, and &s;u|preme Director of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t India Companies, with a right of choo&s;ing all the other directors, from a double number of can|didates, named by the company: in &s;hort, his influence pervades every department of the State.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Stadtholder claims the right of appointing a military tribunal, called the <HI>High Council of War.</HI> This was e&s;tabli&s;hed by William the Third: as it tended to &s;helter the military from the common courts of ju&s;tice,
<PB N="178" REF="197">it was thought dangerous, but was neither li|mited in 1747, nor at the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Stadtholder in 1766: though it was reformed by the patriots in 1781, and may, po&s;&s;ibly, never be revived. Moreover, by the commi&s;&s;ion from the States-General, to the late Prince of Orange, dated 12th of May, 1747, he was inve&s;ted with full powers to command the whole forces of the Republic, for the pur|po&s;es, (among&s;t others) of "maintaining and pre&s;erving the union, and of &s;upporting the pre&s;ent form of government."</P>
<P>To this ample li&s;t of princely privileges, may be added, his influence in the choice of envoys and amba&s;&s;adors: his right to re&s;pite, or &s;ave &s;uch criminals, as come from Brabant, to &s;ettle at the Hague. In Utrecht, he not only changes the magi&s;trates yearly, but his approbation is nece&s;&s;ary in the nomination of the deputies propo&s;ed by the General A&s;&s;embly of that Province; in Friezland, he di&s;tributes all military honours, and employments, names the Councellors in the courts of ju&s;tice, the Receiver-General, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In Overy&s;&s;el, he is the fir&s;t member of the Province; nor can any litigations, or civil, military, or even religious di&s;pute, be terminated, but by his deciding
<PB N="179" REF="198">voice and judgement. In Groningen, the &s;ame privileges he enjoys in Holland, are &s;ecured to him. In Guelderland, his prerogative is yet more extended; and to what has been already ob&s;erved of his &s;way in Holland, it may be added, he can <HI>there</HI> a&s;&s;emble the States-General, convene the Council of Deputies, and is, in his own per&s;on, exempt from all charge.</P>
<P>Such, my friend, and &s;o great, is the authority and the nature, of the Stadtholderian govern|ment, concerning which, there have, at all times, been very different opinions, and &s;ometimes, &s;o
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Revolution, which was plotting while the Gleaner was collecting his &s;heaves, and which has &s;ince been brought about, is but one out of many proofs. <HI>Les Etats Unis</HI> &s;eem to agree in nothing but to <HI>di&s;agree.</HI></NOTE> diametrically oppo&s;ed to each other, as to create in the Republic, the mo&s;t dreadful in|&s;urrections and di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The author, to whom I am indebted for &s;ome of the above ob&s;ervations, conceives it might be happier for the republic, if the Stadtholder, who&s;e office is intended to connect and a&s;&s;imilate the jarring elements of this complicated con&s;titution, were inve&s;ted with more power and le&s;s influence. Preroga|tive, it mu&s;t be owned, is u&s;ually odious in a free country, but when exactly defined, it is
<PB N="180" REF="199">&s;urely le&s;s dangerous than influence. The mo&s;t <HI>timid</HI> Stadtholder would not he&s;itate to employ powers expre&s;sly granted him to &s;uppre&s;s faction, and the <HI>bolde&s;t</HI> could not &s;afely exceed them. At pre&s;ent, the Stadt|holder, though he has very little &s;hare in the &s;overeignty, has the right of choo&s;ing the &s;overeigns of the republic; becau&s;e the depu|ties to the provincial &s;tates are nece&s;&s;arily ma|gi&s;trates, and the magi&s;trates are, in general, cho&s;en by the Stadtholder. It &s;eems, indeed, probable, that the influence ari&s;ing from hence, and from the whole patronage of the army, might ea&s;ily be converted into power, and that an artful and ambitious governor might be|come ab&s;olute, without the danger u&s;ually at|tendant on arbitrary power, becau&s;e he would reign under the <HI>forms of a free government.</HI> Wil|liam the Fir&s;t, we know, was on the point of becoming ma&s;ter of the Republic. Maurice was able to bring
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>John d'Olden Barneveldt, Advocate General of the States of Holland, acquired the e&s;teem of the Republic and of Foreign Powers for his addre&s;s, both in his negociations and emba&s;&s;ies: in&s;omuch that he may be con&s;idered among&s;t the founders of the States. Henry the Fourth, and Queen Elizabeth, held him in high re&s;pect. Barneveldt, wi&s;hing to re&s;train the prero|gatives of Maurice of Orange, oppo&s;ed the Armenians to the Gommari&s;ts, which la&s;t were the partizans of this Prince. Maurice, to revenge this outrage, a&s;&s;embled a &s;ynod at Dor|drecht, compo&s;ed of Deputies from all the Calvini&s;t churches in Europe, except tho&s;e of France, in 1618-19; and this a&s;&s;embly treated the Armenians with as much rigour as if they had not been of the &s;ame communion; and as if tho&s;e of the reformed religion had not taken from the church the right of deciding the&s;e controver&s;ies. Barneveldt, adjudged by twenty-&s;ix Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, had his head &s;truck off in 1619, under pretext of a de&s;ign to deliver up his country to Spain. Thus fell the man, who had pa&s;t his whole life in reiterated endeavours to prevent his country from becoming &s;ubject to this very power. They &s;ent to him the mini&s;ter Walacus, to prepare him for death, who found Barneveldt writing to his wife. On the entrance of Walacus, Barneveldt told him that he had all his life long been in preparation for leaving this world, and that therefore his attendance might be di&s;pen&s;ed with. Walacus in&s;i&s;ted on performing the duties of his mi&s;&s;ion. Sir down then till I have fini&s;hed my letter. Walacus took a chair; and now, Sir, &s;aid Barneveldt, calmly folding up what he had written&mdash;pray who are you? On being told, Barneveldt enter|ed into a religious controver&s;y, and di&s;puted many points in|&s;i&s;ted on by the other, all along prote&s;ting his perfect innocence as to the crime for which he was about to die. Upon &s;ome re|pre&s;entations of Walacus, he &s;aid, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How applicable to tho&s;e who have lately fallen victims to the times be|fore us.</NOTE>When I was in power, I go|verned, according to the maxims of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> times, and was ho|noured, and to-day I am to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> after the maxims of <HI>the&s;e."</HI> His two &s;ons, Ren&egrave; and William, having formed a re&s;olution to revenge the death of their father, entered into a con&s;piracy, which was, however, di&s;covered. William &s;aved him&s;elf by flight, but Ren&egrave; was taken and condemned to death. His il|lu&s;trious mother demanded his pardon of Prince Maurice, who an&s;wered her petition in the&s;e words.&mdash;<Q>It appears &s;trange, that you do that for your &s;on, which you refu&s;ed to do for your hu&s;band.</Q> The lady, worthy to be the wife of Bar|neveldt, an&s;wered, <Q>I did not a&s;k pardon for my hu&s;band, becau&s;e he was innocent: I a&s;k it for my &s;on, becau&s;e he is guilty.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The fate and hi&s;tory of the De Witts, is, al&s;o, worth reviving in your memory, as another in&s;tance of that danger which is annexed to high &s;tation. Among&s;t the numerous accounts of the&s;e &s;ingular and unfortunate victims, the following is the be&s;t, and, I find on enquiry, the true&s;t gleaning.</P>
<P>A barber-&s;urgeon came to the camp of the Prince of Orange, and informed him, that Cornelius De Witts, burgoma&s;ter of Dort, and brother to the great pen&s;ionary, had given him mo|ney to make away with the Prince; becau&s;e, as he &s;aid, the Republic could not otherwi&s;e pre&s;erve her liberty. Upon this &s;lender intelligence, the court of Holland committed De Witts to pri&s;on, and on no &s;tronger evidence condemned him to lo&s;e all his offices and employments, bani&s;hing him from Holland and We&s;t Frie&s;land for ever. The people, who believed they were betrayed by De Witt to the King of France, looked upon this rather as a de&s;ign to get him out of the way, than as a &s;entence of puni&s;hment. However, De Witt's wife and friends pre&s;ented &s;everal petitions and remon&s;trances to the Court in his vindication. They in&s;i&s;ted upon the well-known &s;ervices he had done the State for many years, that he was but ju&s;t returned from on board the fleet, where his very enemies, and among&s;t them Admiral De Ruyter, could atte&s;t his con|duct and loyalty. They alledged, al&s;o, the whole tenor of his life and conver&s;ation; and even referred to the records of &s;eve|ral other courts, wherein the barber, his accu&s;er, had been convicted of perjury. His &s;entence, neverthele&s;s, which was adapted rather to the conjuncture, than to the rules of ju&s;tice, was confirmed, the barber &s;urgeon &s;et at liberty, and the mob inflamed by his repre&s;entations, became clamorous at the doors of the pri&s;on. In the mid&s;t of this gathering tumult, the Pen|&s;ionary very imprudently came in his own coach, to carry his brother out of town, which looked like a triumph over the &s;entence: but as he was conducting him to the outer Gate, the populace interpo&s;ed; upon which the Pen&s;ionary &s;poke to them with &s;ome violence: ill di&s;po&s;ed to bear any irritation, the mob forced both the brothers back into the pri&s;on. The tumult in|crea&s;ing, three troops of hor&s;e, who then lay at the Hague, &s;tood to their arms, but the rabble mounted to the tops of the hou&s;es, to &s;ee that neither of the brothers e&s;caped. At length, demanding vengeance, mob-like, they knew not why, broke open the pri&s;on doors, with &s;miths' hammers, mu&s;kets, &amp;c. then went into the chamber, where the De Witts, were found embracing each other&mdash;a Bible was on the table before them. The Pen&s;ionary a&s;ked, with great tranquillity, what they &s;ought, and why they raged? For you we &s;eek, and for your lives we rage, they replied. Cornelius De Witt, took his brother by the hand, and on going down &s;tairs, the latter was wounded in the eye with a pike, and immediately after hurried away by the mob, to the very place, where his life had been attempted two months before, and there murdered; his brother in the next in&s;tant &s;hared his fate. Thus fell a &s;acrifice to public fury, and private faction, two of the mo&s;t eminent, and, perhaps, worthy members of the Republic; though Burnet, and &s;ome other hi&s;torians ob&s;erve, that the Great Pen&s;ionary had, in a manner, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Council of State, and taken the whole manage|ment of affairs on him&s;elf, which, &s;ays the Bi&s;hop, excited much de&s;erved indignation again&s;t him, and Sir William Temple, &s;eems to have been of the &s;ame opinion; but they are &s;till the &s;ubject of as much eulogy as cen&s;ure at the Hague. I was curious enough to vi&s;it the hou&s;es where they lived, the pri&s;on where they were confined, and the place where they died, and each had its appropriate reflection in my mind; the whole tending to convince me, my dear friend, that the po&s;t of hap|pine&s;s and &s;ecurity is, "the private &s;tation." Notwith&s;tand|ing which, ambition has &s;till its votaries, and its intrigues, and men, in general, contend as violently for public honours and employments, as if they were ro&s;es without thorns: alas! they are more frequently thorns without ro&s;es!</P></NOTE> Barneveldt to the block. Accident alone prevented William the Second
<PB N="181" REF="200">from e&s;tabli&s;hing a military government within the walls of Am&s;terdam. William the Third
<PB N="182" REF="201">was certainly as much a Sovereign, in fact, at the Hague as at London. On the other hand,
<PB N="183" REF="202">a long minority would, probably, be again fa|tal to the Stadtholder, and produce a De Witt
<PB N="184" REF="203">or a Van Berkel. During the infancy of the Stadtholder, the influence and patronage mu&s;t be transferred &s;omewhere, and it is difficult to transfer them with &s;afety. Every thing might fall into confu&s;ion, until de&s;pair, or the inter|ference of &s;ome neighbouring nation, &s;hould incite the people to take the government into their own hands, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the con&s;titu|tion: po&s;&s;ibly this might be more full of peril than all the re&s;t: at lea&s;t very lamentable in|&s;tances are before us.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="204">Many, however, are &s;till advocates for the ple|nitude of the Stadtholderian authority. St. Evremond, who lived four years in Holland, and who employed that penetration and &s;agacity for which he was &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, to di&s;co|ver the true genius and character of the people, and, e&s;pecially, to gather their undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;entiments on con&s;titutional &s;ubjects as Repub|licans, &s;peaks of them as follows: <Q>I remem|ber often to have told the great pen&s;ionary, that the real character of the Dutch is mi&s;|conceived. They have not much of that pride which &s;upports the <HI>dignity</HI> of an inde|pendent character. The pride they <HI>do</HI> pro|fe&s;s, is more for their property than per&s;ons. They apprehend, that an avaricious prince would appropriate their wealth, and that a violent one might commit outrages to the injury of their commerce; but, tho&s;e great points &s;ecure, they accommodate to the de|gree of &s;way nece&s;&s;ary to their Stadtholder with plea&s;ure. If they are attached to the re|publican form, it is chiefly on account of its being favourable to their traffic; and if the magi&s;trates value their independence, as far as it goes, it is partly for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and partly for the &s;atisfaction of governing tho&s;e who are dependent: yet the people
<PB N="186" REF="205">had rather acknowledge the authority of a prince than a magi&s;trate; and on the whole, they are rather devoted to the Hou&s;e of Orange, than to tho&s;e who in the name of patrioti&s;m would &s;ubvert it. Many revo|lutions have been agitated; much blood has been &s;hed.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Evremond &s;aw with a prophet's eye: there are tho&s;e who agree with him in his conclu&s;ive opinion, even at this cri&s;is.</NOTE> More political convul&s;ions may be expected; but, I &s;u&s;pect, after all the&s;e extraordinary &s;trokes of wantonne&s;s, idlene&s;s, zeal, or infatuation, the power of the Stadt|holder will rather be increa&s;ed than dimi|ni&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps this learned writer thought, that the &s;overeignty of the &s;tates of each province &s;erved as a counterpoi&s;e to the &s;overeignty of the Stadtholder, and the authority of the Stadt|holder <HI>un point de raillement</HI> for that multitude of petty &s;overeignties, which, upon account of their occa&s;ional oppo&s;ition and difference, re|quire &s;uch a <HI>conciliating</HI> power as the mediator and centre of their union.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the various revolutions, which have been, at different times, oppo&s;ed to the authority of the Stadtholder, you will expect of me a cur&s;ory account of the cau&s;es that led to the&s;e commotions, and the effects
<PB N="187" REF="206">wrought thereby. The <HI>harve&s;t</HI> of the&s;e facts has been long &s;ince got in, and have been col|lected from tho&s;e wide fields of ob&s;ervation, which rebellion, <HI>under the form of patrioti&s;m,</HI> always yields, when oppo&s;ed to royal or prince|ly rights, <HI>under the form of prerogative.</HI> I &s;hall, a&s;&s;uredly, lay before you &s;ome Gleanings on the&s;e eventful &s;ubjects, &s;imply &s;tating the cir|cum&s;tances on <HI>both &s;ides,</HI> and leave the infe|rences to your own judgment: but this mu&s;t be the object of a future letter, when we have breathed a little from politics: otherwi&s;e, you may exclaim with Hamlet, "&s;omewhat too much of this."&mdash;For the pre&s;ent, then, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, in the words of a &s;en&s;ible traveller, that, whether the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed government of this Republic be capa|ble of reform or not&mdash;whether, according to the opinion of &s;ome, liberty &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no more <HI>here than in Turkey;</HI> or, according to others, that it is the <HI>be&s;t ordered government now in the world,</HI> it is certain (in de&s;pite of tho&s;e male|contents, whom not even the adoption of their <HI>own</HI> &s;y&s;tems would long keep from a re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of innovation) the United Provinces di&s;play a more wonderful &s;cene to a per&s;on of any reflection, than Rome her&s;elf in her &s;acred pageantry, and all the magnificence of her
<PB N="188" REF="207">triumphal arches, baths, obeli&s;ks, columns, grottoes, amphitheatres, and catacombs; her maje&s;tic temples, &s;plendid altars, and pompous proce&s;&s;ions. For, if we con&s;ider the Roman and the Belgic commonwealths, we perceive the latter making greater advances towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her opulence and gran|deur in <HI>a few years,</HI> than the other was able to do in <HI>&s;everal ages.</HI> In Holland, a whole na|tion &s;eems to have been born at once, and a beautiful, well-cultivated region, like the Cre|ation in the Phoenician &s;y&s;tem, ri&s;ing out of the bo&s;om of the deep. The wi&s;e&s;t nations of Europe &s;tand amazed at the &s;cene, and can find no parallel (taken for all in all) in the annals of the world.&mdash;An handful of oppre&s;&s;ed, un|happy men, make head again&s;t four mighty tyrants, of whom, each has, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, cau&s;ed not only nations, but all Europe to humble; and after obtaining glorious victories over them all, at length e&s;tabli&s;h their rights and liberties, and tran&s;mit tho&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings to their po&s;terity. One cannot reflect on their &s;hort, but intere&s;ting hi&s;tory, without a veneration for tho&s;e nobles who &s;ought in defence of the people, and, be the imperfections of govern|ment what they may in other re&s;pects, that very people owe a very &s;incere gratitude to the
<PB N="189" REF="208">Princes of Na&s;&s;au Orange, who, by their wi&s;|dom and valour, animated both the people and nobility; and, in founding a great Republic, de&s;ired, in return, that they, and their de&s;cend|ants, &s;hould be con&s;idered as the friends, de|fenders, and protectors of that Republic they had formed.</P>
<P>If it has been found nece&s;&s;ary for the peo|ple to contribute a certain quota, and a pretty large one, for the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, they are to con|&s;ider, likewi&s;e, that they &s;ee the money &s;o con|tributed laid out on works of real u&s;e and emolument to them&s;elves. In Rome, both old and new, the citizens were cru&s;hed under a load of taxations, to aggrandi&s;e a few, and enable tho&s;e few to lay &s;till more oppre&s;&s;ive bur|thens on their &s;ometimes yielding and &s;ome|times re&s;i&s;ting &s;houlders. In&s;tead of circu&s;&s;es, and amphitheatres, erected for the cruel delight of de&s;troying the human &s;pecies, the Dutch dykes, and &s;luices, repre&s;ent public works of no le&s;s art and grandeur, for general &s;afety and pre&s;ervation. Rome, amid&s;t <HI>&s;ome</HI> better examples, exhibited a race, generally &s;unk in ferocity, &s;loth, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and poverty: Holland of ingenuity, diligence, application, and public energy.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="209">Such is the language and the &s;entiment of <HI>one</HI> party. The <HI>other,</HI> of cour&s;e, is its con|tra&s;t, in every particular; but we will here take leave of both, till a more convenient &s;ea&s;on. Meanwhile, if the provinces were as firmly united in good fellow&s;hip and alliance with one another, as you and I, my dear-loved friend, are, in kindne&s;s of affection, their Re|public would be the mo&s;t enviable and lea&s;t interrupted &s;tate upon earth.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Hague.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BY way of interlude, permit me to conduct you to the Hague <HI>fair,</HI> where, though &s;ome circum&s;tances of public tumult, of which in their place, have deducted &s;omething from the u&s;ual <HI>agremens,</HI> we &s;hall find, not a few plea&s;ant gleanings. You perceive, that I write this letter at the time that the &s;ages of the Ba|tavian &s;tate thought it proper to impede the cour&s;e of plea&s;ure, as well as of commerce. The Hague fair felt this check mo&s;t &s;everely; for their High Mightine&s;&s;es i&s;&s;ued an immiti|gable decree again&s;t the French, German, and even Dutch theatres, nay more again&s;t <HI>les Grands Jeux,</HI> and <HI>les Petits Jeux,</HI> thereby leav|ing this celebrated Fair only its carca&s;e, and taking away its &s;pirit a mere &s;keleton with|out fle&s;h or feathers. But then, in lieu of all this, though the burgoma&s;ters had &s;tripped the body, they had by no means neglected the &s;oul; for who&s;e banquet they had ordered all hands, once a week, at a &s;tated hour, to prayer; the object of which was, to return thanks to
<PB N="192" REF="211">the Almighty Leader of Armies, for having enabled them, and their good allies, to drive the French patriots back to their own territories, and &s;o ran the &s;upplication <HI>to keep them there.</HI> I was much &s;urpri&s;ed, on my re-entrance into this town, after a &s;hort ab&s;ence, to find all the fair|folks &s;hutting up their &s;hops and booths betwixt three and four o'clock in the afternoon; but I was told, there was an order, that not a &s;tiver's worth of any thing &s;hould be &s;old, till after divine &s;ervice: yet if, Sir, &s;aid my informer, (having an eye to this world, as well as the next, in de&s;pite of magi&s;tracy) if, Sir, after the clock has &s;truck &s;ix, being <HI>obliged</HI> to pray till then, you &s;hould want any thing in my way, nobody &s;hall u&s;e you better, the moment I can get rid of the church.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fair</HI> de&s;erted was a new object; and I took an almo&s;t &s;olitary &s;urvey of it; for the booths and walks were nearly emptied into the churches; and to &s;hew me that the magi&s;trates are very much in earne&s;t, I ob&s;erved a party of &s;oldiers take into cu&s;tody a &s;hopman, who, &s;etting his affection more on things <HI>below</HI> than <HI>above,</HI> had the temerity to re-open his &s;tores &s;ome moments &s;ooner than the moment pre|&s;cribed:
<PB N="193" REF="212">an offence for which his &s;hop re|mained &s;hut during the fair.</P>
<P>It is worth noting to you, that on the return of the good people from their devotions, they worked double tides, and at lea&s;t brought with them that part of &s;cripture which admo|ni&s;hes every man to be diligent in his calling.</P>
<P>And now, the whole range of &s;hops, from being in the &s;olitary &s;tate I have de&s;cribed, were di&s;played with an almo&s;t incredible rapi|dity: the play, trim, fine&s;&s;e, and trick of the gainful arti&s;t, who deems every thing which the <HI>law cannot lay its long hands on,</HI> as fair, were once more put in motion; and, as if they had re&s;olved to be no lo&s;ers on earth for what they reluctantly, I fear, &s;acrificed to heaven, they did not again clo&s;e their booths till after midnight!</P>
<P>And, believe me, &s;uch a fair as that of the Hague, even in its <HI>maimed</HI> &s;tate, when viewed by moon-light, accompanied as it was when I &s;aw it by innumerable &s;tars above, and lamps below&mdash;(pardon this anti-climax) was a &s;ight well meriting any traveller's ob&s;ervation. Se|veral of the &s;treets are near a mile in length,
<PB N="194" REF="213">and the &s;quares extremely &s;pacious. The &s;hops were placed either along or around the mo&s;t exten&s;ive of the&s;e, di&s;covering, in a &s;ort of rivalry of each other, the magnificence, and the variety of their articles, as well as an in|credible number of people, of all nations, and of all de&s;criptions, parading backwards and forwards&mdash;&s;erenaded by bands of itinerant mu&s;icians, of all nations likewi&s;e, and an appa|rent oblivion of all care and di&s;a&s;ter; and, though amid&s;t all this, a thoughtful mind may now and then be tempted to exclaim, with the ancient philo&s;opher&mdash;what an infinite va|riety of idle things are here that I do <HI>not</HI> want! one cannot but be highly plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve &s;o many of the arts of life, whether u&s;eful or ornamental, thus brought into one point of view, for the accommodation, grace, and amu&s;ement of &s;ociety, reflecting, at the &s;ame time, that the mo&s;t unimportant article has been the work of indu&s;try, &s;kill, and talents, all, or each of which, even when employed on the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant toy (an infant's rattle) is better engaged than in &s;quandering the like mea&s;ure of time in idle occupation, or wicked plea&s;ures; and I mu&s;t own I took my noctur|nal rounds with my full &s;hare of &s;atisfaction, happy to <HI>forget</HI> that "midnight &s;hews" are
<PB N="195" REF="214">not among&s;t the diver&s;ions my health u&s;ually permits me to partake.</P>
<P>On my return home, about one in the morn|ing, I encountered my old friend, Mr. Punch, "a fellow of infinite je&s;t," if not of wit, for whom I have always had a mo&s;t &s;incere regard, deeming an hearty laugh&mdash;(pardon me, ye vo|taries of the never-&s;miling, grace-loving Lord of Che&s;terfield) a real acqui&s;ition, and he who can innocently rai&s;e it, a <HI>benefactor to mankind.</HI> It &s;eems, the harmle&s;s buffoonery of this cele|brated per&s;onage e&s;caped the pro&s;cription of the magi&s;tracy, though I &s;u&s;pect it was upon promi&s;e of good behaviour; for, be&s;ides, that his di&s;cour&s;e to his wife, the prie&s;t, and the people, was an inveterate panegyric on the States General, and the Stadtholder, and an abu&s;e of the French patriots, &s;ome of whom he belaboured furiou&s;ly, he had decorated him|&s;elf, and the whole of his little drama, with orange-coloured ribbons: he had an orange in his hand, &s;queezed the contents of it into his throat, and knocked down a figure, repre&s;ent|ing one of the National Convention with the rind, and was, in &s;hort, perhaps the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubject of the Hou&s;e of Orange in the whole Fair.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="215">I have mentioned the &s;trolling mu&s;icians. The&s;e gentry come from Upper Saxony, Bra|bant, Tyrole, and other countries on the con|tinent, in bands of eight or ten per&s;ons of both &s;exes, to attend the Dutch fairs. They ply the <HI>table d'botes,</HI> private hou&s;es, &amp;c. and are
<Q>"Happy to catch you ju&s;t at dinner-time!"</Q> and they are as regularly &s;een at your meals as the di&s;hes, or the waiters. The Hague fair this year received &s;trong reinforcements from the French emigrants, all trades and profe&s;|&s;ions, as well as nobles, making an e&s;cape from that unhappy country, and carrying their indu&s;try and ingenuity into others. They carry with them, al&s;o, their re&s;entments and prin|ciples, a curious in&s;tance of which pre&s;ented it&s;elf in a quarrel which took place in the &s;treet between two of the&s;e mu&s;ical parties; the one German, the other French: but they both broke all the laws of harmony, and kept no mea&s;ure with each other, the words Demo|crate and Ari&s;tocrate, (with &s;uitable epithets) being liberally di&s;pen&s;ed, till they were both taken into cu&s;tody, to &s;ettle their di&s;putes be|fore a magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="216">Many of the&s;e people &s;ing and play ex|tremely well, &s;ome with con&s;iderable ta&s;te; and each band being habited in the dre&s;&s;es, and armed with the in&s;truments of their country, throw an air of joyou&s;ne&s;s over the fairs of Holland, which, with all their richne&s;s and re|&s;ort, they would otherwi&s;e want.</P>
<P>You have, doubtle&s;s, heard of Dutch toys. How they came to be <HI>famous,</HI> I am yet to learn. They are remarkable only for the &s;trangene&s;s of their invention, the clum&s;ine&s;s of their execution, and the general indecency of their appearance. Among&s;t the mo&s;t po|pular, are wooden and <HI>brazen</HI> (pray allow the pun) men and women, voiding ducats, or vo|miting florins. But this, whether intended by the Dutch wits as a &s;atire on the &s;uppo&s;ed love of money of the Dutch, or only as a whim, is nothing to the objects <HI>in the &s;ome &s;tyle,</HI> which are exhibited publicly at the fairs of Holland.</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, very little account is made of the <HI>per&s;onal decencies,</HI> if I may u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion, either here or in other parts of the Con|tinent. There is nothing more common than to &s;ee, not only pea&s;ants and country people,
<PB N="198" REF="217">of <HI>both</HI> &s;exes, upon the road, but very well dre&s;&s;ed men and women, in the be&s;t towns, and in capital &s;treets of them, do tho&s;e things in pub|lic, almo&s;t <HI>o&s;tentatiou&s;ly,</HI> which, in every quarter of Great-Britai is concealed with a care that borders on a <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ing</HI> con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the im|perfections of nature, if tho&s;e things, which attach to human beings can or ought to be &s;o called. There is no occa&s;ion, however, me|thinks to &s;hew our&s;elves remarkably <HI>proud</HI> of them, as actually &s;eems to be the ca&s;e in the&s;e countries. What el&s;e can make females, young and old, <HI>choo&s;e</HI> the mo&s;t obvious places, with|out any regard to pa&s;&s;engers, for the &s;ettle|ment of little affairs that are undoubtedly among&s;t the things, which, even in a religious &s;en&s;e (according to the maxim, "cleanline&s;s is holine&s;s") <HI>ought</HI> to be done in a corner. But, through every part of the Republic, the rever&s;e of this is &s;o true, and &s;o <HI>common,</HI> that the mo&s;t rapid traveller, in an hour's tour of any one town or village may ob&s;erve it. It is certainly a "cu&s;tom more honoured in the breach, than the ob&s;ervance;" and I cannot but wi&s;h the good people on the Continent would "reform it altogether;" which, never|thele&s;s, cannot be expected, while there does not &s;eem to be even a &s;en&s;e or idea of inde|cency
<PB N="199" REF="218">attached to it; of which I will give you a memorable in&s;tance in its place. The di&s;|gu&s;t one feels on the&s;e occa&s;ions is &s;omewhat covered by other &s;en&s;ations, when any thing highly ridiculous blends with it: as in a cir|cum&s;tance which I &s;aw at an hotel in one of the large&s;t towns of the Republic. Two very little apartments were made in the centre of a pa&s;&s;age that extended the length of the whole hou&s;e, and were placed in &s;o neighbourly a way as almo&s;t to join, being parted off only by a &s;light boarded partition. Being con&s;e|crated to different &s;exes, the proprietor was very nice in his di&s;tinctions, by affixing over the door of the one, "Ladies Secret;" and the other, "Gentlemen's;" but, le&s;t a po&s;&s;ible mi&s;take &s;hould <HI>&s;till</HI> happen, he had cau&s;ed the <HI>figures</HI> of a lady and gentleman to be painted in rather whim&s;ical &s;ituations in the centre of the different doors, by way of a&s;certaining right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. After what I have a&s;&s;erted, you will think it "nothing &s;trange," that both the&s;e little tenements &s;hould be very often occupied, at the &s;ame in|&s;tant of time, by per&s;ons of different &s;exes, but of <HI>all &s;orts of quality;</HI> and the entrances and exits, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are &s;o far from being made, as with us, by <HI>&s;tealth,</HI> that the performers appear to expect as much applau&s;e as an
<PB N="200" REF="219">actor, who has played his part highly to the &s;atisfaction of his audience.</P>
<P>Le&s;t, however, you &s;hould call out for "an ounce of civet to &s;weeten your imagination," I &s;ummon your attention to what was, at the time it happened, a very general object of cu|rio&s;ity&mdash;no le&s;s than a public di&s;play of the Prince, Prince&s;s, and family of Orange, in a walk round the Fair, with the annual ceremo|nies of that exhibition, and its effects.</P>
<P>This great event took place at the Hague, on, or about, twelve minutes pa&s;t three o'clock, an hour at which the <HI>public</HI> have returned from their dinners; and the <HI>world,</HI> by which are meant the few for who&s;e pride and plea|&s;ure they think it was made, have ju&s;t fini&s;hed their toilette. The truth of the time, when this walking pageant happened, lay preci&s;ely betwixt the third and fourth hour: a circum|&s;tance about which I am particular for the u&s;e of &s;ome future hi&s;torian who may think fit to record it for the benefit of future po&s;terity. We have &s;een, you will allow, the chrono|logy of equally important actions &s;ettled with no le&s;s &s;olemnity, for which precious mor&s;els of biographical accuracy, if po&s;terity are
<PB N="201" REF="220">thankle&s;s, their ingratitude be upon their heads. Authors can only de&s;cribe illu&s;trious deeds, but cannot be re&s;pon&s;ible for their impre&s;&s;ions. On &s;uch a day, then, at &s;uch a point of time, and on a day, which, no doubt, was "&s;ent as if meant t'invite the world abroad," their Royal Highne&s;&s;es the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange, &s;urrounded by their &s;plendid &s;uites, the lords and ladies of the court, and in their gala &s;miles and habits, came forth from their palace, or rather plea&s;ure-hou&s;e in the wood, to be &s;tared at by the mob.</P>
<P>The &s;aid mob received them in the u&s;ual manner, crowded about them, followed their heels, half &s;mothered them with the du&s;t, which curio&s;ity always rai&s;es on &s;uch occa|&s;ions&mdash;devoured them with their eyes, or &s;uf|focated them with their breath. Rather an heavy tax, which little folks levy on great ones! but which the&s;e latter pay, well plea&s;ed, for admiration from the former, and think them|&s;elves gainers! But, in the in&s;tance before us, policy, more than the love of fame, was the active agent.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They all concentred in the Revolution which has &s;ince hap|pened&mdash;again, perhaps, to be revived.</NOTE> internal di&s;|orders, concerning which, I &s;hall in due time expatiate; and the Orange party, though hap|pily fixed more &s;trongly than before, were anxious to attempt the nece&s;&s;ary rigour which had been in certain ca&s;es found nece&s;&s;ary, with &s;ome after acts of conde&s;cen&s;ion. And this was no bad opportunity. You &s;hall hear how their Highne&s;&s;es profited of it. The Prince and Prince&s;s made a pau&s;e at every &s;hop, pur|cha&s;ing, at each, a great variety of articles, &s;ome of which they took as fir&s;t coming to hand, and others they &s;elected. The&s;e articles were given fir&s;t to the pages, then the other &s;ubordi|nate officers of the &s;uite, and then, for the want of more than two hands a piece, to the other courtiers without exception, till every lord or lady in the train was labouring, in an exce&s;&s;ive hot day, with his or her load, like a parcel of footmen lacquying a modern fine lady on a &s;hopping day. It was curious to &s;ee what heavy burthens your true court-bred ladies and gentlemen can bear in the &s;ervice of their prince, aye and bear &s;milingly. All this time their <HI>chapeaus</HI> were under their arms; their pockets &s;tuck out with fairings, like an a&s;s's panniers, and
<PB N="203" REF="222">like that enduring animal they appeared to be &s;o familiar with &s;lavery, that they took patiently what nothing but a bea&s;t of burthen would deign to carry. The high blood of a gene|rous hor&s;e would have lifted up his heel, at the attempt of &s;uch an in&s;ult; a filly foal would have &s;norted di&s;dain, and the very forehor&s;e of a team would have rung his bells with indig|nation. As Benedict &s;ays, "an oak with but one green leaf on it, would have refu&s;ed" to fetch and carry in this cur or courtier-like manner.</P>
<P>But an oak is not the proper emblem of the&s;e ob&s;equious per&s;onages. They rather re|&s;emble the o&s;ier, who&s;e pliability
<Q><L>"Can turn, and turn again,</L>
<L>"And be obedient"</L></Q> to every &s;lavi&s;h purpo&s;e. I do not know I ever felt my blood more thoroughly chafed; and yet the &s;en&s;ation was not without that &s;ort of plea&s;ure which is derived from a triumphant ridicule&mdash;to &s;ee tho&s;e <HI>&s;ervants in office</HI> &s;tep|ping forward, officiou&s;ly, as if zealous to di&s;|tingui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;hewing who could be&s;t do the mo&s;t abject work of it, who, neverthe|le&s;s, would not carry the weight of a penny loaf half a mile to keep a poor wretch from &s;tarving, and would think a reque&s;t of the

For more than an hour they took the rounds of this exten&s;ive fair with their re|&s;pective leads; one, a jar of &s;weetmeats; an|other of pickles; a third, a box of ribbons; a fourth, a box of perfumes; a fifth, a piece of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k; a &s;ixth of &s;ilver; a &s;eventh, a ba&s;ket of toys; an eighth, a ba&s;ket of artificial flowers.

<P>Pry'thee tell me, my friend, you who have looked at, and into, human nature with no common eye!

Is it from a too powerful &s;en&s;e of the value of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which are beyond our gra&s;p? or from the contagion of example? or from our own mode&s;ty? or, la&s;tly, is it from a certain fa&s;cination which we conceive to be inherent in greatne&s;s?

A patron, however, is found to our poet's wi&s;h,
<Q>"Be&s;prent with titles, and hung round with &s;trings."</Q> See! there is a &s;tar on his brea&s;t, and a ribbon acro&s;s his &s;houlder: aweful circum&s;tances! The bard approaches.

<PB N="208" REF="227">this arbitrary de&s;pot, who &s;aves or damns, like Antony and Lepidus, with a da&s;h&mdash;even with a dip of ink&mdash;feels as &s;incere a joy at get|ting out of his great man's great hou&s;e, as if he had e&s;caped from the dark hole at Calcutta into his garret.</P>
<P>No wonder, therefore, that the makers of wooden or gingerbread Kings and Queens &s;hould feel the like &s;en&s;ations in their very oc|ca&s;ional, per&s;onal intercour&s;e with the higher powers of fle&s;h and blood. The little traders, indeed, at the Hague, who gave ri&s;e to the&s;e remarks, &s;eemed to have forgot they <HI>were</HI> of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> fle&s;h and blood; for, as the princely vi&s;itors &s;topped at their booths, the articles offered, trembled in their hands, and like the afore&s;aid author, they recommended their re|&s;pective goods with the wor&s;t grace in the world. A perfumer emptied a bottle of <HI>eau de luce</HI> on the &s;leeve of his Royal Highne&s;s's coat, and a milliner pre&s;ented a cap and fea|thers to one of the courtiers, in&s;tead of the Prince&s;s of Orange.

<P><PB N="209" REF="228">But the thing that principally delighted the congregated mob happened at the booth of a confectioner, where the royal progre&s;&s;ers not only bought, but actually ate &s;everal little ar|ticles. To &s;ee a Prince and Prince&s;s <HI>eat</HI> was in it&s;elf a fea&s;t, at which hundreds of the &s;pectators had never banqueted before; and, indeed, the anxious curio&s;ity that pur&s;ued every mor&s;el of cake or bi&s;cuit, as well as every drop of orgeat or liqueur, not only in the road to their Highne&s;s's mouths, but as far as could be down their throats, each pea&s;ant at the &s;ame time, opening his own mouth, as if it was expected by &s;ome preternatural means, the mor&s;el &s;o eaten would make its &s;econd appearance, and find its way into their own mouths.&mdash;This, I &s;ay, would ju&s;tify my &s;up|po&s;ing that many deemed it &s;trange &s;uch great people, and fine folks, &s;hould eat or drink at all. In which cafe (and therefore it is to be wi&s;hed, among&s;t other modern inventions, this could not be brought about) the homage which the Great receive from the Little would be better founded. Men and women, reduced to the <HI>vulgar</HI> nece&s;&s;ity of continuing life by con&s;tant &s;upplies of gro&s;s and common ani|mal food, are, whether kings or beggars, no objects of particular veneration, becau&s;e there
<PB N="210" REF="229">is no pre-eminence, unle&s;s we &s;hould concur to pay &s;uperior homage to &s;uperior appetite; on which &s;core the beggar would often de&s;erve the &s;overeignty; but if tho&s;e who, even in the act of eating and drinking, can engage the at|tention of &s;o many beings, which beings can do the &s;ame things to the full as well, how much more would be the gaze, the wonder, and the wor&s;hip of the little world, could the great ones luckily contrive to di&s;pen&s;e with tho&s;e levelling offices of ordinary nature, which does away all rea&s;onable per&s;onal di&s;tinctions at lea&s;t among&s;t men. At this Fair, for in&s;tance, had the&s;e augu&s;t per&s;onages above mentioned, to have &s;hewn them&s;elves to the people, under the <HI>elevating</HI> circum&s;tances of having arrived at &s;uch a period of their lives, without ever having ta&s;ted any common <HI>vulgar</HI> &s;u&s;tenance, fed, as it were, by a &s;ublime con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own dignity, and looking with benign pity on their poor eating and drinking &s;ubjects, how noble would that have been! It would have been a &s;ubject, not only au|thorizing the abject &s;en&s;ations with which the mob &s;urveyed the&s;e Princes and Prince&s;&s;es at their dirty employment of chewing cakes, and &s;wallowing &s;pirits, but would throw the gazing multitudes at &s;uch an aweful di&s;tance, as to
<PB N="211" REF="230">make them a&s;hamed of their own modes of exi&s;tence. A country bumpkin's exclaiming (to his wife or friend) Look! if a Prince or Prince&s;s, King or Queen, does not eat and drink! &s;hould be con&s;idered rather as a dimi|nution of that dignity, of which &s;o many are ambitious; but, on any of the&s;e augu&s;t per|&s;onages coming into public among&s;t the in&s;e|rior orders of mankind, to have it &s;aid&mdash;Ob|&s;erve tho&s;e are beings far above our vulgar natures; they are &s;upported by the excellency of their own pre-eminent &s;ituations.

But you remember the compliment that the late Mr. Garrick the king of the &s;tage, paid <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> when it was &s;ugge&s;ted that his appearance at a benefit play, though only to &s;hew him&s;elf, and walk off, would fill the hou&s;e. "Yes (&s;aid the actor) I know very well that my good friends, the Gods (meaning the mob of the galleries) would fill their benches, and &s;et the theatre in a roar, were I only to come on to <HI>be &s;haved."</HI></P>
<P>I am very far from entering into the &s;pirit of that undi&s;tingui&s;hing non&s;en&s;e to which hot-hearted and light-headed innovators have,
<PB N="212" REF="231">of late, given the ab&s;urd name of <HI>natural equality;</HI> becau&s;e, I am thoroughly convinced, Nature her&s;elf (who is an all-wi&s;e politician) has di&s;criminated in all things with admirable order, and did never yet &s;anction &s;uch non|&s;en&s;e; but I could wi&s;h the homage which the lower pay to the higher powers, was le&s;s to their extrin&s;ic, and more to their internal me|rit; and yet, as happine&s;s is &s;aid to be our "being's only end and aim"; and as I am cer|tain the hundreds who amu&s;ed them&s;elves at the above royal <HI>cramming</HI> &s;cene, were to the full as happy as the crammers, the &s;y&s;tem had, perhaps, better &s;tand as it is, with re&s;pect to the little people; only, it might be as well, if the great were at lea&s;t as anxious to be ad|mired for a good head and a good heart, as for a good &s;uit of cloaths, and a good appetite; for, after all, my friend, it will be found

<P>Perhaps, this la&s;t quality is a principal cau&s;e of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which he has been expo&s;ed, as Duke Lewis, who wi&s;hed to obtain an exclu&s;ive influence over his pupil, appears to have &s;tudiou&s;ly encouraged in him a diffidence in his own judge|ment, and a di&s;tru&s;t of all tho&s;e who &s;urrounded him. Hence, though always firm in his adherence to the general line of con|duct, which he thought e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;ts of his country, he was frequently wavering and undetermined in the choice of the means, &s;o that his character was for &s;ome time con|&s;idered as a mixture of per&s;onal courage and political irre&s;o|lution. But, on his being deprived of Duke Lewis, and abandoned to his own efforts, the energy of his mind was found to increa&s;e in proportion to the pre&s;&s;ure of his mis&s;or|tunes; and his conduct during tho&s;e calamitous times, which immediately preceded the revolution, would not have di&s;graced the able&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P><PB N="214" REF="233">I was &s;o lucky as to be pre&s;ent at the review of the militia, which, when embodied, always takes place on the day after the fair, of cour&s;e much company &s;tays in town to attend this &s;pectacle, and it is really very &s;plendid. The whole company of militia men were a&s;&s;embled on the parade, under my chamber windows; they were ranged under &s;helter of &s;ome of the fine&s;t trees in the world, which extend by va|rious rows from the Voorhout to the wood. The men were dre&s;&s;ed extremely well, and for the en&s;igns of loyalty in the <HI>national</HI> colour, they &s;eemed to have &s;tripped all the branches of all the orangeries in the Republic; every &s;oldier having as large a bunch of orange in
<PB N="215" REF="234">his hat, as is worn by my lady's footman in his be&s;t livery, by way of bouquet.&mdash;Orange al&s;o were the cockades&mdash;orange the fa&s;hes&mdash;orange the &s;word-knots, and orange the flags.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock, being all gathered toge|ther, they marched to a noble &s;quare in the wood, where they performed their exerci&s;e, and their manoeuvres, in a very re&s;pectable manner. The Princ eand Prince&s;s came in &s;tate coaches; each drawn by &s;ix cream coloured hor&s;es, and followed by twelve other coaches and four. Their tents were truly magnificent both within and without, and every well dre&s;&s;ed per&s;on, had a priviledge to enter and partake the collations. The &s;ucceeding day there was a review of &s;uch of the regulars, as were not on actual &s;ervice, and a repetition of the &s;ame proce&s;&s;ions and pageantries.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the forces of the Re|public, we are told, that after the treaty in 1697, the States kept 44,992 men in pay; formerly, in time of peace, they u&s;ually employed thirty or forty men of war in con|voys. At the beginning of the la&s;t general war, the States by treaty, furni&s;hed in the Nether|lands 102,000 men, viz. 42,000 for garri&s;ons,
<PB N="216" REF="235">and 60,000 for the field. Great Britain only 40,000. By &s;ub&s;equent treaties the quotas of both powers were augmented according to the exigencies of affairs: that of the States to 129,488 &s;oldiers, and that of England to 72,197, deducting the &s;maller number from the greater, the remainder is, 57,261; &s;o that the Dutch ought to have had in Flanders 57,261 fighting men, more than the Engli&s;h. The States were at the expence of all the powder and ball expended in the many &s;ieges laid by the Duke of Marlborough, during nine campaigns: an enormous &s;um! and not ea&s;ily computed. It was at their co&s;t, likewi&s;e, that the fortifications of the town, then taken, were repaired, and their magazines filled up! Amaz|ing efforts for &s;o &s;mall a State! the whole Seven Provinces, not exceeding five or fix of our &s;malle&s;t Engli&s;h counties, and not more than one or two of our mo&s;t
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of York is &s;aid to be, &s;ingly, as large as the Seven Provinces united.</NOTE> con&s;iderable!</P>
<P>In 1740, the States had 36,000 men on foot, including 12,000 in the barrier towns. The e&s;timate of more modern times, both with re|gard to their army and navy, are more imme|diately
<PB N="217" REF="236">in the view; and, therefore, I &s;hall not mention it.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, &s;ays Carter, that almo&s;t the whole army of the States are foreigners. The rea&s;on is obvious, other countries abound with &s;uperfluous people, Holland wants men. On account of this &s;carcity, one would think it very difficult to rai&s;e &s;oldiers: the majority be|ing employed in trade, manufactures, or &s;ea &s;ervice; and yet the States are &s;eldom at a lo&s;s. A Dutch officer no &s;ooner beats up for recruits, than numbers flock to him, for very good rea|&s;on: Fir&s;t, the pay is good, and exact; &s;econd|ly, their High Mightine&s;&s;es, punctually keep their words with them: the &s;oldier li&s;ts for what number of months, or years he plea&s;es; at the expiration of which term, were there ever &s;o hot a war, he has his di&s;charge on de|mand. And, thirdly, the officers are very humane. They have been &s;o accu&s;tomed to u&s;e their dome&s;tic &s;ervants well, <HI>according to the laws of Holland,</HI> that, luckily, they cannot get the better of that habit, but extend it to the &s;oldiery. It has been ob&s;erved, and I have been re&s;ident long enough, to confirm the truth of it, that in the United Provinces there is a kind of rational, not frantic, equality,
<PB N="218" REF="237">natural, indeed, to well ordered Republics, that prevails between all orders of the people, who live in an humble friend&s;hip, by no means obtru&s;ive, or unplea&s;ant with their &s;uperiors. By con&s;equence, there is better &s;ervice, and more willingne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is, however, univer&s;ally admitted, that the greate&s;t &s;trength of the United Provinces, is in their &s;ituation, a natural &s;ecurity &s;o potent, that nothing but treachery and di&s;&s;ention among&s;t them&s;elves could, or can ever &s;ubdue it. On the we&s;t and north they have the ocean: on the &s;outh are canals, large rivers, and arms of the &s;ea, &s;o as to be ab&s;olutely inacce&s;&s;ible: on the ea&s;t lies We&s;tphalia, and on the &s;outh ea&s;t Juliers and Cleves; and were all the&s;e to fail, they can, as it were, convert their towns into arks, and their country into a world of waters; where, as in a deluge, their enemies would be di&s;mayed or drowned.</P>
<P>There has been, you know, a recent nece&s;|&s;ity for flying to their <HI>Dernier re&s;orte,</HI> in which, however, as I &s;hall in the cour&s;e of our cor|re&s;pondence &s;hew you, the Republicans were by no means unanimous.

The Hague is, ju&s;tly, allowed to be, in point of fa&s;hion and <HI>agr&eacute;mens,</HI> of every kind, the London and Paris of Holland, and this wood is, as I have ob&s;erved, its Hyde and St. James's Park, and its Tuilleries al&s;o, being, like tho&s;e, in the centre of the town. It is barely an Engli&s;h mile and an half in length, and little more than half a mile broad. Travellers, who come fre&s;h from old England, with all old England's prejudices (among&s;t which are the ideas re&s;pecting old England's oaks) would, were not prejudice <HI>an incurable malady,</HI> be con|vinced, that old England had not monopo|li&s;ed
<PB N="220" REF="239">all the maje&s;ty, or beauty of vegetable nature. The oaks of Holland, and of this identical wood, have as &s;overeign an air, and are of as venerable an age, and (the circuit of ground con&s;idered) flouri&s;h in as great abundance, as any in the proude&s;t fore&s;ts of the &s;aid old England. A thorough home-bred, untravelled &s;on of our i&s;le, would be apt to wonder how they could have emi|grated from tho&s;e fore&s;ts, not believing it po&s;&s;ible they could be natives of the &s;oil. Na|tives, however, they are, and nature has been venerated as &s;he ought to be, in the liberty of their growth, for, except in the grand avenues that form the malls, and a few other pro|menades, which are cut through them, not a branch has been "curtailed of its fair pro|portions," for centuries, except in ca&s;es of the <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> exigence. Even in times of private, or of public, rapacity, when the mo&s;t innocent and lovely parts of nature are &s;acrificed to the mo&s;t dreadful art, that of war, this wood has been &s;pared. In the great war with Spain, for in&s;tance, Philip II. it appears, ordered, that not a twig &s;hould &s;uffer, and the &s;oldiers who were in the habit of hewing down all before them, re&s;pected this command. The common people, who have &s;eldom any high ta&s;te for
<PB N="221" REF="240">rural graces, entertain a more than &s;uper&s;titious regard for this wood: their High Mightine&s;&s;es, however, in the year 1576, to &s;upply a State nece&s;&s;ity, had &s;at in Council upon it, and pro|nounced the &s;entence of de&s;truction. The burghers a&s;&s;embled, remon&s;trated, and, un|der&s;tanding the Republic required &s;uch a &s;acrifice, (alledging the &s;ale of the timber would yield &s;uch a &s;um)&mdash;that &s;um, then re|joined the Citizens, &s;hall be mo&s;t willingly paid to ran&s;om our favourite wood, and the money we rai&s;e, may be appropriated to the &s;ervice of the &s;tate. This was accordingly done, and &s;ince that time, (upwards of two hundred years) there have not been a dozen trees devoted to the axe:&mdash;&s;o jealous, in|deed, are the Dutch of pre&s;erving them, that the death of an hare or partridge in England, is not more revenged by a country ju&s;tice, (who happens him&s;elf to be a &s;port&s;man, on a poor fellow who happens to be a &s;port&s;man al&s;o) as are tho&s;e men or boys, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to do any injury to a &s;ingle bough of this beau|tiful wood.</P>
<P>This vigilance and attention on the part of the magi&s;trates, is very di&s;intere&s;ted, in pro|portion, as that of the common people is &s;el|fi&s;h;
<PB N="222" REF="241">for the Dutch gentry are, by no means, fond of wood walks, or, indeed, <HI>any</HI> walks, while they can either &s;tay at home, or be car|ried abroad; preferring any conveyance, (even one of their cart-coaches), to that of their own legs. All attractive as this wood appears to be, you rarely &s;ee, except on a Sunday when great folks exhibit them&s;elves, as well as little ones, a dozen per&s;ons in the whole tour of its mo&s;t public walks; and if you encounter one man in a week's vi&s;itation of the private paths; (I mean one Dutchman)&mdash;you &s;tare at him as a curio&s;ity. For my own part, I can &s;ay with Comus,
<Q><L>"I know each lane, and every alley green,</L>
<L>"Dingle, or bu&s;hy dell of this fair wood,</L>
<L>"And ev'ry bo&s;ky bourne from &s;ide to &s;ide,</L>

<L>"And if one &s;tray attendant there was lodg'd,</L>
<L>"Or &s;hrouded in its limits, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee him."</L></Q></P>
<P>Since the di&s;a&s;ters, or &s;hall we call them triumphs of France, I have now and then met a &s;olitary emigrant, with his book, according to the cu&s;tom of his nation, read|ing, or &s;eeming to read, but, in general, the whole range of the wood, has been left "to nature and to me." Ancient authors, however, inform us, that it was once
<PB N="223" REF="242">u&s;ual for the foreign mini&s;ters or others, to give concerts alternately thro' the &s;ummer, when the wood was crouded with the fa&s;hion of the town and country, as well as the citi|zens and pea&s;antry. The mu&s;ic was a mixture of the rural and martial kinds, con&s;i&s;ting, prin|cipally, of drums, trumpets, and French horns; and care was taken not only to keep the per|formers at a proper di&s;tance, but out of the &s;ight of the company. But, though this addi|tional charm might be very agreeable, none is wanting to the true lover of nature in &s;uch a wood as this, where, &s;carce a mile removed, from the "bu&s;y hum of men."

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I had the plea&s;ure to addre&s;s you la&s;t, it has occurred to me that in&s;tead of apologizing for yielding a little to the magic of the mu&s;e, I &s;hould have claimed your atten|tion to the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation, and enquiry into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Dutch <HI>poe&s;y;</HI> which would be to you, and ought to be to every traveller, a ju&s;t object of con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>It would, indeed, be an unpardonable omi&s;|&s;ion not to appri&s;e you, that, as a &s;tranger, you will be welcomed to
<Q>"A Fea&s;t of rea&s;on and a flow of &s;oul."</Q> given by &s;everal private gentlemen who meet, by turns, weekly, at each other's hou&s;es, in this town, to di&s;cour&s;e, in a friendly, but not formal, manner on the arts and &s;ciences; and you will, no doubt, become a member of the poetical &s;ociety, which was in&s;tituted here &s;ome years
<PB N="225" REF="244">&s;ince, for the purpo&s;e of bringing to greater poli&s;h the production of the Dutch mu&s;e. This &s;ociety is held in one of the be&s;t apartments of Prince Maurice's palace.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged, even by the Dutch them&s;elves, that the little handful of watery earth, which belongs to them, unknown even to the re&s;t of Europe till the abdication of Charles the Fifth, and getting fir&s;t into repu|tation of a martial kind, by the courage of its inhabitants again&s;t the u&s;urpations of Spain, &s;eemed, for ages, unde&s;erving the notice of the <HI>literary</HI> world.</P>
<P>Even at this day, when the torch of every mu&s;e &s;eems to flame over every other part of Europe, the light which is emitted from the poets of the Dutch hemi&s;phere, is like that of a taper ju&s;t glimmering through the Provinces. The names of Hooft, Vondel, and Antonides, are &s;carce known beyond tho&s;e narrow limits, while every minor author in the boa&s;ted age of Louis XIV. every puny whip&s;ter of the mu&s;e; the author of an epigram, or an acro&s;tic, is familiar to every reader, down even to tho&s;e pettyfogging quarrels among&s;t them&s;elves, that are a di&s;grace to letters, and
<PB N="226" REF="245">ought to be remembered only with &s;hame. Thus the wor&s;t poetry of France, has a more exten&s;ive character than the be&s;t of Holland.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this is very well, and truly ac|counted for by a writer of the la&s;t mentioned country. This inju&s;tice, &s;ays he, is derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, as that which &s;o long impeded the reputation of Dryden, Milton, and Shak&s;peare of England; namely, the ge|neral ignorance of foreigners, in the Dutch and Briti&s;h languages. The Dutch idiom though more rich, and powerful than the French, is not, never was, and probably never will be, either by fortune or by choice, a language of fa&s;hion. That of France, on the contrary, like the Greek and Latin formerly, is the univer&s;al language of courts, and in mo&s;t countries a marked object of education; ri&s;ing, partly, from the famous revocation of the edict of Nantes, in that &s;warm of emigrants, who were con&s;trained to fly from their native land in 1685. Ba&s;ne&s;e, Bau&s;obre, Bayle, Le Clerk, and very many other illu&s;trious philo|logi&s;ts, hence became known to the re&s;t of the world. And the more recent flight which this ingenious people have been compelled to tak|ing, (and are continuing to take at this
<PB N="227" REF="246">moment) will give the influence of their gay and amiable language a yet wider range. Cer|tainly, there is no one would attempt to com|pare with the literary &s;atellites that formed the French glory of the 17th age, and of poetry in particular, (for it was that age which added Corneille, Moliere, Boileau, Fontaine, and Racine, to the con&s;tellation) the few bards who have illumined the horizon of Holland. This country has never yet given birth to a poet, who ro&s;e above the merits of Reynard; and he can &s;carce be e&s;timated be|yond the la&s;t form of the &s;econd, or perhaps, the fir&s;t bench of the third. Neverthele&s;s, Holland has produced men of genius and learning, who, in every art and &s;cience, have de&s;erved well, not only of their own country, but of all Europe; yet, if we except a very few individuals, &s;uch as, Leuenhoch, Huygens, Grave&s;zande, Boerhaave, and Vandoveren, in phy&s;ic; Voct in juri&s;prudence, and Burman and Gronovius in general literature, there is &s;carce an author who&s;e <HI>fame</HI> has reached his <HI>next neighbours, on the other &s;ide the water.</HI></P>
<P>Why, a&s;ks a &s;en&s;ible Dutchman, are our poets, philo&s;ophers, and hi&s;torians, &s;o little popular among&s;t &s;urrounding nations? Why
<PB N="228" REF="247">are not the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of their writings, at lea&s;t, as well known as the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e of other countries, the very tra&s;h of who&s;e pre&s;&s;es we tran&s;late? Surely, it is a <HI>&s;ettled point</HI> with others to neglect us? Were it not &s;o, our <HI>Little Republic</HI> would not confine its character to trade and commerce, but a&s;&s;ert its rights to fame in the <HI>Great Republic of Letters.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutch have &s;ucceeded chiefly in the Epic; of their power in which &s;pecies of poetry, they have exhibited three examples, one by Antonides, one by Rotzans, and an epic poem, called the Hi&s;tory of Abraham, the Patriarch; in Dutch, Abraham de Aart&s;vader. To &s;hew that the Dutch are not deficient in point of <HI>quantity,</HI> they have filled two con&s;iderable volumes with the names and hi&s;tories of their authors, among&s;t whom very re&s;pectable mention is made of the above epic poets. By way of &s;pecimen as to the <HI>quality,</HI> I will pre&s;ent you with a &s;hort account of the lives and writings of the&s;e favourite bards.</P>
<P>Antonides van der Goes, was a native of Zealand, born in the year 1648, and died in 1684. His genius is characteri&s;ed by its ea&s;e, boldne&s;s, and fire: and his be&s;t poem is
<PB N="229" REF="248">that which celebrates the river Y, on which the city of Am&s;terdam is erected.</P>
<P>This poem is divided into four Cantos: and the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Am&s;terdam, &s;ituated on the Y furni&s;hed the author with his &s;ubject. It is thus conducted; the fir&s;t canto is employed in celebrating every thing remarkable on the banks, or on the bo&s;om of the river. The de&s;criptive parts are here a little too redund|ant; the common fault of de&s;criptive poetry. The bridge, called the <HI>Pont Neuf</HI> (New Bridge) is repre&s;ented as the re&s;idence of fame, on which &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have erected a temple, dedicated to plea&s;ure and commerce, the par|ticular objects of which are painted with great truth and energy. A part of the city, which is called the New I&s;land, gives our author a fair opportunity to celebrate Admiral Ruyter, who&s;e hou&s;e &s;tood in that quarter.</P>
<P><Q>At the name of that hero, exclaims the 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who&s;e expre&s;&s;ions I have tran&s;lated <HI>literally.</HI></NOTE> poet, the river &s;wells under my view, as with pride: I behold the delighted waves advance to the foot of his palace, as if to bathe and &s;anctify the &s;pot with gratitude and admiration. 'Twas thus the Tyber overflowed its banks to te&s;tify its joy at the
<PB N="230" REF="249">triumph of Octavius Caefar. O, Ruyter! thy name is more de&s;erving the epithet of Great, than that of Egypt's Conqueror, no wonder then if the con&s;cious Neptune and all his watery train, &s;hew thee a more pro|found homage!</Q></P>
<P>Now, although, my dear friend, I fear, the&s;e &s;ame Y. waters cared as little for the &s;pot where the admiral was born, as for that where the author purcha&s;ed the quill with which he wrote the de&s;cription, or for the goo&s;e on who&s;e wing it originally grew; though I am apprehen&s;ive, this &s;ympathi&s;ing river
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Gleaner's "Poem of Sympathy."&mdash;Pardon the <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> quotation.</NOTE> "Nor gave one bubble le&s;s, one murmur more,"</Q> on the occa&s;ion, we mu&s;t either allow the&s;e poetical <HI>imaginings,</HI> or take away from the mu&s;e, altogether, her mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential priviledge; invention, and all her creative powers&mdash;
<Q>"Tho&s;e painted clouds that beautify her <HI>lays."</HI></Q> and you are to remember that a man of genius "looks round on nature and on life, with the eye which nature only be&s;tows on genius."&mdash;the eye that di&s;tingui&s;hes in every thing pre&s;ented to
<PB N="231" REF="250">its view, whatever there is on which imagina|tion can delight to be detained. Poets of all countries have claimed them, and when &s;o many Engli&s;h and French epics have made <HI>their</HI> rivers <HI>&s;peak, &s;ing, dance,</HI> and exhibit a great many other pretty conceits, it will be hard, indeed, if the river Y may not be allowed to pay a few pa&s;&s;ing compliments to one of the heroes who &s;o bravely di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf <HI>as a Son of the Waves.</HI> It was this Admiral Ruyter, you know, who had &s;o many "hair breadth e&s;capes," particularly in gain|ing his de&s;tined port, in the Sale Roads, in defiance of five Algerine pirates, who lay in wait for, and pur&s;ued him: the Moors who from the town were &s;pectators of this action, pre&s;ented him with a Barbary hor&s;e, richly capari&s;oned, on which he was invited to make a triumphal entry, followed by the five pirate Captains in chains. WE have rea&s;on to re|member this great naval officer on our own &s;core; for it was he who, in conjunction with Van Tromp, commanded the fleet again&s;t us, and with &s;o much honour in 1653. It was he who took the famous renegado Amand de Dias, whom he hung at the yard's arm. In the three ob&s;tinate engagements, between the Dutch, Engli&s;h, and French fleets, at the mouth
<PB N="232" REF="251">of the Texel, Ruyter conducted him&s;elf in &s;o gallant a manner, that Vice Admiral D'E&s;trees, in a letter to Colbert, &s;aid, "I &s;hould be very willing to purcha&s;e with my life, the glory which Ruyter has acquired in the&s;e de&s;perate actions." The patents for his dukedom were pre&s;ented, after his death, to his family, but preferring the title of <HI>De&s;cendants of a good Citizen,</HI> they declined every other honour; and I have always thought it one of the few <HI>real</HI> in&s;tances, among&s;t the many <HI>imputed</HI> ones, of greatne&s;s of mind in Louis XIV. when, on being congratulated on the death of this noble mariner, he exclaimed, "that he him|&s;elf &s;hould be unworthy of life, were he not to regret, &s;incerely, the lo&s;s of &s;uch a man as De Ruyter to his country, and to the world!"</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;idered, it was &s;urely the lea&s;t, the river Y. could do, to make the hou&s;e in which he had lived a bow, as it flowed by; and the man that cannot per&s;uade his rea&s;on to &s;mile on this image of <HI>poetical ju&s;tice,</HI> de&s;erves to go dull rounds of a mill hor&s;e, for the re&s;t of his life.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Canto, after having given a &s;plendid panegyric on navigation, the poet pays
<PB N="233" REF="252">due attention to the grand fleet, then lying in the river, and celebrates the atchievements of particular &s;hips of war, at that moment an|choring in the &s;tream. He next de&s;cants on the different articles of the Dutch trade, brought by their merchantmen into the port of Am&s;terdam, from all quarters of the globe.</P>
<P>Book the third, is taken up with an epi&s;ode; the poet then carries his readers to the <HI>bottom</HI> of the Y. where we are invited to partake of a FETE MARINE, which the grateful river prepares to celebrate the marriage of Thetis and Peleus. The author, arriving at the bottom, is con|ducted by one of the water godde&s;&s;es, who gives him the hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t celebrated rivers; &s;ee'&s;t thou, &s;ays the godde&s;s, &s;ee'&s;t thou <HI>that</HI> noble river, who&s;e long tre&s;&s;es re&s;emble the poplar of Hercules? That is Eridanus. Thus was it called before thy fatal enterprize, pre|&s;umptuous Phaeton, ere angry Jove precipi|tated thee, (even in the &s;plendid car that con|tained thee) to the bottom of the waves; but, in pity to thy unhappy &s;ire the name has been changed to that of the Po. At fir&s;t, thou per|ceive&s;t, that the impri&s;oned waters are hid un|der the giant &s;houlders of the Alps, but, &s;oon regaining their liberty, they quench the burn|ing
<PB N="234" REF="253">thir&s;t of panting Italy, and rambling on|ward, lo&s;e them&s;elves at length in the Adriatic. Li&s;tening, in days of yore, to the &s;trains of Ho|race, they &s;u&s;pended their cour&s;e, to hear the poet celebrate his Lydia, and her &s;portive airs; or, while he &s;ung of Chloe, prai&s;ing her mode&s;ty; or addre&s;&s;ed his Maecenas. And then, favourite of Apollo, divine &s;on of Maro, thou frequente&s;t often the banks of this cla&s;&s;ic river. It &s;wells to greet thee, and with proud atten|tion li&s;tens to thy &s;ong, during who&s;e enchant|ment it cannot flow: it even commands its waves to keep the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence. Its &s;ubject Naids hear thee with admiration; and when thou &s;aved&s;t Aeneas from falling Ilion, and led him to rich Au&s;onia, each wave ap|peared to do thee reverence, and dwelt with rapture on thy &s;train!</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age, which cannot but appear like "pro&s;e run mad" in a literal tran&s;lation, has great beauty in the original, as well for the imagery as the ver&s;ification, the latter of which is remarkably harmonious and energic.</P>
<P>By order of Neptune, the Y is placed above its fellows, and takes rank as &s;overeign. If any true Briton &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed at this,
<PB N="235" REF="254">let him con&s;ider he has no right to monopo|lize the <HI>prejudices</HI> of nations; and, &s;urely, he &s;hould not be offended at &s;haring one of <HI>his</HI> mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed imperfections with a neigh|bour. Methinks, he ought rather to rejoice, that &s;uch prejudices and imperfections are not peculiar to him&s;elf. Indeed, the Dutch bard &s;eems con&s;cious that this pre-eminence given to his own river gods will occa&s;ion a &s;pla&s;hing among&s;t tho&s;e of other countries; for that which is &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide over the Seine is very much irritated: the Baltic is by no means &s;atisfied, and the Thames is in a ter|rible pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e troubled waters da&s;h their foam at each other, through half a &s;core pages, each contending for the &s;uperiority, which is at length given by the monarch of the &s;ea to the Y and the other rivers are obliged to give up the point; though they do not give it up without a great deal of muttering, as they rowl back di&s;graced to their own banks.</P>
<P>The la&s;t canto furni&s;hing &s;cant matter, and that little of a rather dry nature, a meagre de&s;cription of the Y our poet takes refuge from this &s;terility of his &s;ubject, in his own prolific fancy. He introduces a &s;ybil, who pre&s;ents us with a magnificent painting of all
<PB N="236" REF="255">the evils and misfortunes which the Batavians &s;uffered <HI>before</HI> they enjoyed that degree of power and glory which they now boa&s;t. This may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of poetical hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the Republic; and our author has contrived to render it one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of his work. He concludes with an addre&s;s to the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, to who&s;e wi&s;dom and government he attributes, in great mea&s;ure, the wealth and pro&s;perity of the city.</P>
<P>If the critics &s;hould refu&s;e this work the rank of an Epic, it certainly may command a di&s;|tingui&s;hed place among&s;t the be&s;t de&s;criptive poems, and were there no other &s;pecimen, &s;hould redeem Holland from the &s;tigma of never having given birth to a truly poetical production.</P>
<P>The general te&s;timony borne to the merit of the author of this work corre&s;ponds with the above. He is con&s;idered as a poet of a rich and &s;ublime genius; and his Poem on the Y as a very noble performance. After what this bard has &s;ung of that river, and our Denham of the Thames, tho&s;e celebrated waters need not envy the Tiber his poets.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="256">The Great pen&s;ionary Cotts, is, al&s;o, allowed to be de&s;erving of the prai&s;es which Carter and his own countrymen be&s;tow on him. Correct, copious, affecting, and for his delicacy and harmony, ju&s;tly &s;tyled the Dutch Ovid. His ver&s;es have in them &s;omething that intere&s;ts and attaches: uniting a profound knowledge of the human heart, and the characters of men, with a &s;plendid fancy, he paints with truth, force, and vivacity. His diction is pure and natural, his thoughts delicately conceived, and happily delivered, and his de&s;criptions, to other charms, have tho&s;e of novelty.</P>
<P>This ingenious writer was, likewi&s;e, a &s;aga|cious &s;tate&s;man; he was Lord Keeper of the Seals of Holland and We&s;t-Friezeland, and Stadtholder of the Fiefs; but he withdrew him|&s;elf at an early period of his life, while in the blo&s;&s;om of public favour, from all political bu|&s;ine&s;s, to indulge his love of poe&s;y: in which, as well as in the general ea&s;e and grace of his ver&s;es, he re&s;embles our favourite Prior, who like|wi&s;e was, you know, both poet and politician. De Cotts, however, was never per&s;uaded to quit his retreat, but at the in&s;tance of their High Mightine&s;&s;es, who once <HI>borrowed him from the mu&s;es,</HI> and the &s;hades where they delight to
<PB N="238" REF="257">dwell, to undertake a diplomatic character, as Amba&s;&s;ador of the States to England, in tho&s;e &s;tormy days, when Cromwell, with a daring hand, governed our helm. The pen&s;ionary was received among&s;t us with the di&s;tinction his talents commanded, as a wit and a man of bu&s;ine&s;s; but his emba&s;&s;y being honourably compleated, he returned to his native coun|try, and to one of the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered parts of it, where he had an e&s;tate, on which he lived, and on which he died, the latter event happening &s;ome time in the year 1660.</P>
<P>The Dutch are extremely proud of this poet. His works have been &s;ent forth in every po&s;|&s;ible &s;ize and form: the la&s;t edition appeared very &s;plendidly, in two volumes in folio, in 1726.</P>
<P>The Dutch theatre depends very much on that of every other country, particularly the Engli&s;h, German, and French, who&s;e plays they give in tran&s;lation with great &s;ucce&s;s. At Am&s;terdam I once &s;aw the tran&s;lation of an Engli&s;h tragedy, a German interlude, and a French farce, acted on the &s;ame night.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="258">The objection brought by the critics again&s;t the dramatic, e&s;pecially the tragic writers, of Holland, is, that they are incorrect, and &s;o far from con&s;ulting Ari&s;totle, &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e both him and his laws. They have, however, one tragic writer of con&s;iderable eminence, and who&s;e pieces are, what is technically, called <HI>&s;tock,</HI> being repre&s;ented in their turn every &s;ea|&s;on. He certainly has a mixture of great faults and beauties. His mo&s;t popular drama is Gi&s;bert of Am&s;tel, or the &s;iege of Am&s;ter|dam. I &s;hould give you but little plea&s;ure, and do the author le&s;s credit, were I to offer you an analy&s;is of this piece, which is a &s;trange jumble of good and bad, &s;ublime and ab&s;urd; though it is performed every &s;ea&s;on, amid&s;t thunders of applau&s;e; which it owes chiefly to the beauty of the &s;eenery and pageantry of the decorations. I cannot forbear giving you one in&s;tance, out of many, of its a&s;toni&s;hing ab|&s;urdity. The cata&s;trophe is thus &s;ettled. Gi&s;|bert, the hero, after the &s;urrender of Am&s;ter|dam, determines to &s;end away his wife and children to avoid the rapacity of the conque|ror. His wife, on the other hand, re&s;olved not to be outdone in tenderne&s;s, de&s;ires to &s;tay with her captive lord, and &s;hare his fate. This brings on between them a conte&s;t of affection,
<PB N="240" REF="259">in which each maintains a generous idea, with the u&s;ual force of di&s;intere&s;ted love. In the mid&s;t of this &s;trife a very unlooked-for vi&s;itor comes on the &s;tage, no le&s;s than the angel Raphael, who pops down from heaven in a cloudy chariot, on purpo&s;e to put an end to this di&s;pute betwixt man and wife. He very dexterou&s;ly makes u&s;e of the &s;aid cloudy cha|riot, to &s;kreen them from their enemies, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts both in fairly running away. Under &s;uch a &s;eraphic guard, no wonder that they got &s;afe out of the garri&s;on; for they were wrapped up &s;nug (together with their children) in the be|fore-mentioned chariot, and &s;eemed to the &s;entinels, &s;ays the bard, a <HI>pa&s;&s;ing cloud.</HI> Raphael conducts them to a &s;afe rece&s;s in the domi|nions of Pru&s;&s;ia, and in their way thither bids them be of good cheer, for that it is the <HI>inten|tion of fate</HI> to make Am&s;terdam one of the noble&s;t cities of Europe, and that he can fore|&s;ee, there will ri&s;e up to future times a Dutch bard, who &s;hall make the misfortunes of Gi&s;|bert and his family, the &s;ubject of a tragedy, which &s;hall be performed with great &s;ucce&s;s on the Dutch &s;tage.</P>
<P>Did ever author contrive, in a more novel way, to pay him&s;elf, and his hero, a compli|ment?
<PB N="241" REF="260">Or, did our Raphael employ him&s;elf in &s;uch a comical bu&s;ine&s;s as he appears to have undertaken in this very comical <HI>d&eacute;noue|ment</HI> of a deep tragedy? One would think that the poet meant to fini&s;h his tragedy by a bur|le&s;que; in which &s;pecies of writing the Dutch greatly excel; their principal author in which &s;tyle is Foquembrog, who is the Scarron of Holland.</P>
<P>Nor are they without tho&s;e &s;elf-taught bards, who an&s;wer to our Stephen Duck's, Wood|hou&s;e's, and the Milkmaid of Bri&s;tol. Of this cla&s;s, Hubert Poot, of Delft, the &s;on of a pea|&s;ant, who flouri&s;hed about a century ago, is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed. We are informed that he had no education, little or no reading, and never &s;uffered his pa&s;&s;ion for making ver&s;es to inter|rupt his duty as a day-labourer: notwith&s;tand|ing which, he is the father of the pa&s;toral and elegiac poetry of his country. His addre&s;s to Ga|latea, and his Idyls, particularly that entituled Diana and Endymion, contain &s;ome very beauti|ful images, and melodious ver&s;ification. <HI>Poeta na&s;citur non fit,</HI> is, you know, an old remark, and POOT's is a very remarkable illu&s;tration of it. You will find the be&s;t edition of his works, in three volumes quarto, with pretty
<PB N="242" REF="261">vignettes, printed at Delft, in 1734. He died in 1733, the year preceding. He is &s;aid to have &s;old his watch, and &s;hoe-buckles, and ring, to purcha&s;e books, deeming the one lux|uries, and the other nece&s;&s;aries. I have paid a vi&s;it to his cottage and his grave; and after having read his works, felt the emotions of a friend at both.</P>
<P>I have gleaned the&s;e literary &s;ketches as a fre&s;h encouragement for the re&s;identiary tra|veller, to attain &s;ome knowledge of the Dutch language; which will enable him to peru&s;e many good poets, of a country which is too commonly thought never to have produced them. I need not remind you, that Era&s;mus, Grotius, and Boerhaave, are to be numbered among&s;t their mi&s;cellaneous writers; a trium|virate, it has been ob&s;erved, not to be excelled by three per&s;ons of any other nation where&s;o|ever the light of learning has been diffu&s;ed. Dryden has properly given to three countries an honour which he deems &s;ufficient to im|mortalize each, you know,
<Q><L>"Three poets, in three di&s;tant ages born,</L>
<L>"Greece, Italy, and England, did adorn;</L>
<L>"The fir&s;t in loftine&s;s of thought &s;urpa&s;t,</L>
<L>"The next in maje&s;ty, in both the la&s;t."</L></Q>
<PB N="243" REF="262">The&s;e little provinces have given birth to three writers, who would have con&s;tituted the glory of any three nations of the world. To Era&s;|mus the whole commonwealth of letters is in|debted for its re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, and a new aera of its glory; and Grotius did honour, not only to his country, but to human nature; and the pride with which the Dutch contemplate their Boerhaave may be gathered from what has been &s;aid of him by John&s;on: <Q>A man formed by nature for great de&s;igns, and guided by religion, in the exertion of his abilities: determined to lo&s;e none of his hours, when he had attained one &s;cience, he attempted another: he added phy&s;ic to di|vinity; chemi&s;try to the mathematics; and anatomy to botany. He recommended truth by his elegance, and embelli&s;hed the philo|&s;opher with polite literature: yet his know|ledge, however uncommon, holds in his cha|racter but the &s;econd place, for his virtue was more uncommon than his learning. He a&s;cribed all his abilities to the bounty, and all his goodne&s;s to the grace, of his God. May tho&s;e who &s;tudy his writings imitate his life! and tho&s;e who endeavour after his knowledge, a&s;pire, likewi&s;e, to his piety!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="263">Neither has the Republic wanted, as Carter ob&s;erves, able hi&s;torians or civilians. Brandt's Hi&s;tory of the Reformation of the Low Coun|tries is a piece &s;o much admired, that one of the pen&s;ionaries u&s;ed to &s;ay, the Dutch lan|guage de&s;erved to be learned by foreigners, if it were only for the plea&s;ure of reading that hi&s;torian; and it is certain that there is no univer&s;ity in Europe where the civil law is taught with &s;o much dignity as at Leyden and Utrecht. Vinnius, and Voet, the fir&s;t upon the In&s;titutes, and the latter upon the Pandects, have been pronounced the &s;tandards of that law. It is not without rea&s;on their law-writers in general, like their pleaders, are accu&s;ed of prolixity; they overwhelm us with a deluge of words, and make us lo&s;e fight of the main point by the multiplicity with which they en|tangle and &s;urround it.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, the &s;ame imputation will lie again&s;t the Dutch divines, the prolixity of who&s;e writings no human patience can &s;upport. They will write a volume on an Hebrew word, and another, by way of &s;upplement, on the pronunciation of that word. I would not, however, urge this too far again&s;t a very re|&s;pectable body; being convinced, no le&s;s than
<PB N="245" REF="264">the author of the Pre&s;ent State of the Pro|vinces, that, if a profound knowledge of the originals of the Bible, and other learned lan|guages, if being well read in the be&s;t com|mentators, and &s;acred critics, a good ta&s;te of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, and controver&s;ies, joined with a laborious di&s;charge of the pa&s;toral duty, be e&s;teemed e&s;&s;ential qualities in forming good clergymen, there are few churches in the world better provided with able mini&s;ters than that of Holland.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I &s;poke of the nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>&s;e defendendo,</HI> of acquiring &s;ome knowledge of the Dutch language, and I noticed, in general terms, the &s;triking re&s;emblance between it and our own tongue. At the time of making this re|mark, I did not know it had been made be|fore; I now find it has; and &s;o good a &s;pe|cimen offered to <HI>prove</HI> that re&s;emblance, that I &s;hall, by way of &s;upplement to what has been previou&s;ly ob&s;erved, tran&s;cribe it, as it lies ready to my purpo&s;e; ju&s;t premi&s;ing, that the Briti&s;h nation are very apt to cen&s;ure and deride that language, without knowing, or at lea&s;t con&s;idering, that the compound them&s;elves &s;peak is little more than the Low Dutch. If we have &s;oftened a few of the terms by Engli&s;h
<PB N="246" REF="265">refinements, and by naturalizing abundance of the French and Latin, the difference is not &s;o great as to make us lo&s;e &s;ight of that upon which it is founded, and which is certainly our parent tongue. Sir William Temple &s;ays, that part of the Saxons who conquered Eng|land came from Friezeland, which is very pro|bable, as that province lies nearer to Saxony than the other two maritime powers, Holland and Zeeland. Numbers of the Saxons came down from the North of Germany at different times into the Low Countries. After having made &s;ome &s;ettlements, they pa&s;&s;ed over into the &s;outh part of Britain, with a mixture no doubt of the natives of the provinces from whence they &s;et out. They, however, &s;till re|tained the names of their nation and di&s;trict, <HI>viz.</HI> of Saxons and Engles. The fir&s;t, in pro|ce&s;s of time, had the good fortune to parcel the country out into &s;even di&s;tinct Saxon king|doms; and the latter, though no very con|&s;iderable part of their own country, had the honour to unite tho&s;e kingdoms into one un|der Egbert, one of their de&s;cendants, about the year 800. Thus the rea&s;on is manife&s;t, why the Low Dutch, properly &s;o called, is &s;poken at this day in England, preferably to Saxon or the High Dutch; and thus, too, we
<PB N="247" REF="266">may account for the general &s;imilarity betwixt the Low Dutch and the Engli&s;h, the latter of which has all the leading features of the for|mer, "more delicately touch'd," as for ex|ample:</P>

<P>If the above proof of affinity be added to tho&s;e already promi&s;ed to be given at the clo&s;e of our Gleanings, it will be manife&s;t that the language now in u&s;age through Great Britain, is, in good mea&s;ure, the &s;ame as that &s;poken in Holland,

<OPENER><DATELINE>Rotterdam.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SEE the uncomfortable di&s;tance of the date of your la&s;t received letter, and of my power to an&s;wer it&mdash;an interval of more than twenty days! Such is the tyranny of winds and waves; and &s;uch the &s;olicitudes of an ab|&s;ent friend.</P>
<P>But, according to the proverb, "ill blows the wind which brings not good to &s;omebody." In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, though it has been to me inau&s;picious, I tru&s;t it has to you been fa|vourable; and that the very cau&s;es which have delayed your letters, have accelerated mine. You will then be &s;atisfied, that my regard keeps pace with your's in the frequency of written evidence.</P>
<P>Yet how different, at this moment, is the face of things in this country from that you have &s;o deliciou&s;ly de&s;cribed! Winter has for|got
<PB N="251" REF="270">his time, and come back into Holland, a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er on the rights of &s;pring. So far from feeling or &s;eeing the blooming approaches of the latter, we are embraced by the utmo&s;t ri|gours of the former: this very morning, though otherwi&s;e bright and fair, being one of the colde&s;t I ever felt in my whole life. Your &s;weet and captivating land&s;capes are inverted. In&s;tead of the earth covered with &s;now-drops, it is covered with heaps of &s;now only; and in lieu of watching the opening buds, thirty or forty &s;kippers are digging in the canals to open the ice; and I can di&s;cover, over my head, only the white-encru&s;ted branches frozen from top to bottom. Yet I cannot, by any means, &s;ay, this &s;ort of &s;cenery is void of at|traction. To a Briti&s;h traveller it is intere&s;t|ing from its novelty; for though a world of white does not &s;eem to admit of much variety, whether viewed in one country or in another, a deep fall of &s;now and hard fro&s;t is certainly very different in its general appearance in Hol|land and England. What it is in the latter you have &s;een and felt: what it is here will be more plea&s;ant, perhaps, in my de&s;cription, than from the evidence of your own feelings.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="271">Rotterdam is in it&s;elf, you know, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and beautiful towns of Holland. It is watered by the Rotte, from whence it borrows its name, and by the junc|tion of that river with the Meu&s;e, and the proximity of both to the &s;ea, is equally well &s;ituated for commerce and navigation. The Engli&s;h ear is caught by its accu&s;tomed &s;ounds in every &s;treet, and almo&s;t in every hou&s;e; for trade has made our language a &s;ettler in this place; the Engli&s;h merchandi&s;e, and the Eng|li&s;h merchant being among&s;t the &s;taple com|modities of Rotterdam, which has long been con&s;idered as the fir&s;t object of intercour&s;e that the Briti&s;h nation has upon the Continent of Europe. The canals, which run into the heart of the city, are &s;o broad and profound, that ve&s;&s;els of a noble &s;ize and of equal burthen, enter into it abrea&s;t, The&s;e canals are &s;ur|rounded by the mo&s;t beautiful &s;treets, each of which is adorned by a row of very fine trees.</P>
<P>Imagine &s;uch trees, &s;uch &s;treets, and &s;uch canals, with all their inhabitants, combining to form a winter piece! Repre&s;ent to your&s;elf the hou&s;es, almo&s;t all windows, and of the cleare&s;t gla&s;s, daily and almo&s;t hourly wa&s;hed, &s;parkling to the &s;un in all the radiance of a
<PB N="253" REF="272">fro&s;ty atmo&s;phere; the canals are a &s;olid floor of thick-ribbed ice, on which a thou&s;and pair of &s;cates, u&s;ed with inconceivable adroitne&s;s, are gliding in as many directions. The ve&s;&s;els of plea&s;ure and bu&s;ine&s;s, of almo&s;t all nations, particularly our own, wedged clo&s;e together, and anchored at the very doors of the proprie|tors: the &s;hips and barges, indeed, are as firm|ly bound as if they were chained to a world of rock; the rigging, ma&s;ts, and even pen|nants, loaded with coagulated &s;now; the trees candied over in the &s;ame manner; but, to|wards the middle of the day, dropping into fleeces by the warmth of the &s;un, as if it was new falling &s;now.</P>
<P>Except it be that our tour-loving country|men &s;eldom indulge the emigrating pa&s;&s;ion in winter, I know not, my dear friend, how it has happened that we &s;o very &s;eldom have been pre&s;ented with, (in <HI>de&s;cription</HI>) a Dutch winter|piece: &s;uch as every one of their capital towns exhibit at this very in&s;tant. The&s;e cold|weather amu&s;ements are u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed over, though they are picture&s;que and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>It has been ju&s;tly remarked, that the deade&s;t &s;ea&s;on in other countries is the mo&s;t lively in
<PB N="254" REF="273">Holland. While this little watry world is fro&s;t-locked, which it is &s;ometimes for three months together, it is a kind of univer&s;al fair or jubilee. Booths are erected upon the ice, with good fires in them. Hor&s;es, rough-&s;hod to the element, run races. Coaches glide over the &s;mooth expan&s;e, like plea&s;ure barges. Men, women, and children, are equally expert. The pea&s;ant &s;cates to town with his panniers, the country girl with her milk pails, and many merchants take their longe&s;t journies du|ring the &s;ea&s;on of the ice. You may &s;ome|times &s;ee a &s;tring of twenty or thirty young people, of both &s;exes, holding each other by the handkerchief, and &s;hoot away almo&s;t with the rapidity of lightning.</P>
<P>This is illu&s;trated at the pre&s;ent moment, as well upon the land as water. Hundreds of little hand &s;ledges, variou&s;ly decorated, and filled with children, covered to their very no&s;es in rugs and furs, pa&s;s to and fro, through the &s;treets, and a no le&s;s number of hor&s;e-&s;ledges, gay and gaudy, drawn by prancing, &s;leek-&s;ided &s;teeds, with long manes and tails, guided by a gentleman, and containing a lady, are flying along in the&s;e fro&s;t-chariots. The&s;e have no wheels, but are moved on an iron rounded
<PB N="255" REF="274">at the ends, and they go &s;ometimes at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles within the hour: the &s;treets, mean while, crouded with &s;pec|tators, gathered together in a kind of happy compo&s;ure, which &s;eems to &s;et at defiance all the inclemencies of the &s;ea&s;on. I mu&s;t not forget the windows, which are all thrown wide open, and &s;tuck with happy and even healthy faces from top to bottom, though it &s;hould &s;now into the apartments; every individual, of whatever rank, entering into the &s;pirit of the entertainment; and it is really curious to &s;ee, when there is a &s;top put to bu&s;ine&s;s, how the people of this, and &s;ome other more nor|thern countries, convert the very rigours of the clime into &s;ources of plea&s;ure and exer|ci&s;e. A native of the more &s;outhern airs would almo&s;t congeal to ice at the bare view of &s;uch a &s;cene as that before me: but cu&s;tom, you know, my friend,
<Q><L>"Will make the flinty and &s;teel couch of war</L>
<L>"A thrice-driv'n bed of down."</L></Q></P>
<P>At all the Imperial, Saxon, and other northern courts, I find the&s;e ice and &s;now di|ver&s;ions are exactly what travellers have de|&s;cribed, and of a very pompous kind. Many of their machines are con&s;tructed in the &s;hape
<PB N="256" REF="275">of lions, &s;wans, dolphins, peacocks well|carved, painted, and gilt. The northern Fair &s;its in one of the&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed in velvet, lined with furs, and decorated with lace and jewels, with a velvet cap on her head, faced and lined with &s;ables: the hor&s;e is finely capari&s;oned, and &s;et off with feathers and ribbons: bells hanging about him, and a &s;tag's horns on his head. One or more pages on hor&s;eback, ride on each &s;ide with torches in their hands, and in this manner, they perform the cour&s;e upon the frozen &s;now, about the &s;treets of Dre&s;den and Vienna, driving full &s;peed after one another in the middle of the darke&s;t night; or &s;ometimes when the moon and her attendant &s;tars are in their fulle&s;t lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>As you know my general aver&s;ion to hi&s;tories of brick, mortar, and fair free&s;tone, you will not expect me to give you any fine de&s;crip|tions of the fine buildings, or other fine places of this fine town, when the &s;aid fine &s;ights are unaccompanied by more intere&s;ting particu|lars: &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as appertain to the &s;outh church (Zuider Kerk.) This was for|merly the place where &s;tood the old Dutch playhou&s;e: after the Revolution the play|hou&s;e was pulled down, and a Scotch church built upon the &s;pot, and now Dutch
<PB N="257" REF="276">&s;ervice is performed; but between the time of its being a theatre and a place of wor&s;hip, fifty other occupations were carried on.</P>
<P>The fro&s;t and &s;now &s;o lock me up on all &s;ides, that till the relenting weather opens the roads, I can neither travel by land or by water; but my inqui&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition leads me among&s;t men and books, and wherever either of the&s;e pre&s;ent me with any thing worthy notice, I will not fail to pick it up for your entertain|ment, or in&s;truction. Take, for the pre&s;ent, a few mi&s;cellaneous remarks de&s;criptive of place and people.</P>
<P>The Dutch are, no doubt, imagined to be great feeders on fle&s;h, and as great drinkers of gin. They are neither. They eat very &s;paringly of animal food, and &s;wallow far le&s;s of &s;pirituous liquors than the Engli&s;h. One of our porters will con&s;ume more Hollands in a day, than an Hollander in a week. The common drink of the country is beer, tea, and coffee: of the two latter, they drink &s;ix or &s;even times in a day; a drunken Dutchman is a rare character.</P>
<P>All ranks of people <HI>&s;hake their heads,</HI> when they di&s;cour&s;e, or even when they li&s;ten.&mdash;
<PB N="258" REF="277">They have a &s;hake of a&s;&s;ent, a &s;hake of objection, an angry &s;hake, a friendly &s;hake, and a loving &s;hake, but to meet with a Dutch man or woman, who does <HI>not</HI> &s;hake the head, is what I have never yet ob&s;erved. In the heat of conver&s;ation this practice is &s;o remarkable, that in a public place, where there are many &s;peakers at a time; in the coffee-hou&s;es, for in&s;tance, the heads <HI>all go together,</HI> as if moved on &s;wivels, and are as ludicrous to any traveller, who&s;e head is firmer on his &s;houlders, as the figures of a parcel of Mandarines on a chimney piece. A Dutch|man might be known from a native of any other country, by this national, and almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;hake. I mentioned this to &s;ome of the people, who mu&s;t have &s;haken them&s;elves out of all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; for of eleven whom I addre&s;&s;ed, nine a&s;&s;ured me, while they &s;hook their heads at me mo&s;t violently, the remark was <HI>not</HI> ju&s;t; and the other two, &s;hakingly, &s;aid, why we &s;hake our heads thus, heaven only knows.</P>
<P>The Dutch women, in general, de&s;erve not the cen&s;ure which other nations have pa&s;t on their <HI>legs.</HI> It is the cu&s;tom of the country, among&s;t all &s;uch as adhere to the habits of it, to di&s;play the leg <HI>more</HI> than midway. The female pea&s;ant &s;hews it nearly to the garter:
<PB N="259" REF="278">and though not often very delicately, the legs are for the mo&s;t part far from clum&s;ily made. They all wear &s;lippers, even in winter; and are, moreover, perpetually dabbling in water; yet are remarkable for being &s;een with a clean pair of &s;tockings, which are almo&s;t univer&s;ally of blue or grey wor&s;ted. In compari&s;on of their general form, their legs are even &s;lender. Their limbs are coar&s;e and heavy, and rendered yet more &s;o by their dre&s;s; e&s;pecially about the hips, which they &s;well out with more than &s;even-fold petticoats, to an even ab&s;urd cir|cumference. They &s;ometimes cover them|&s;elves up with huge black cloth cloaks, and yet you will &s;ee them in the mo&s;t rigorous &s;ea&s;ons of the year, going about without either hats or bonnets. The practice of &s;ticking on a black patch, about the &s;ize of half, &s;ometimes a whole crown-piece, on each of their temples, is al|mo&s;t univer&s;al among&s;t the middle and lower orders of the women. The women them&s;elves tell you, this is as a charm for the headach; the men in&s;i&s;t, it is de&s;igned as a charm of ano|ther kind, and as much a mark of &s;elf admira|tion and coquetry, as the little patches, which were formerly worn by the fair enchantre&s;&s;es of our own country.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="279">I think I have already &s;ent you word that the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, which centre in one man's hands in England, viz. hairdre&s;&s;ing and &s;hav|ing, are in Holland &s;plit into two trades as di&s;tinct as hu&s;bandry and &s;hipbuilding; your chin being committed to a &s;worn &s;urgeon, and your head to a fri&s;&s;eur.

A redbrea&s;t is trotring over my carpet as I write; a poor fro&s;t-nipped chaffinch is ne&s;tling almo&s;t in the a&s;hes of my buzaglio; and a &s;parrow who had, after warming him|&s;elf, a&s;cended my table, is within the length of his beak of the paper, on which I am writi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid in the la&s;t letter, you will conclude that the &s;pirit of plea&s;ure is by no means an inactive one in this country: the &s;pirit of ho&s;pitality is, on the &s;lighte&s;t recommendation, no le&s;s vigorous, or lively; although, in both ca&s;es, mo&s;t other parts of the Continent have a more popular character for courte&s;y and urbanity: but, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that &s;uch character is generally given <HI>by</HI> them&s;elves <HI>of</HI> them&s;elves, or by &s;uch <HI>confederating</HI> nations, as erect their own good name, on the ruins of their le&s;s im|po&s;ing neighbours. An Engli&s;h &s;tranger who vi&s;its Holland, from either curio&s;ity, or misfor|tune, will find, even in the <HI>motives</HI> of his re&s;idence, as much courte&s;y and compa&s;&s;ion, as he could meet with in any other part of the earth: in re&s;pect of the former, a &s;ingle letter of introduction, to any re&s;pectable indivi|dual, will be a pa&s;&s;port to the be&s;t families in that individual's line of connection; and in
<PB N="265" REF="284">regard to the latter, di&s;tre&s;s, in whatever &s;hape, or however brought about, is not le&s;s venerated or relieved by the Hollander than the Engli&s;hman. I was a witne&s;s to many illu&s;trative in&s;tances. Take one.&mdash;A French gentleman, from being di&s;appointed of all re|mittances was (after di&s;po&s;ing of his nece&s;|&s;aries, for current expences) unable to pay his account at his hotel, and &s;o reduced as to throw him&s;elf on the genero&s;ity of his ho&s;t, who not only reque&s;ted him to feel at his ea&s;e, as to the pa&s;t, but at his home as to the future, continuing to lodge and board at the hotel, as many weeks or months, as might &s;uit his con|venience: in addition to which liberality, the landlord begged he might &s;upply him with pocket money, while he &s;taid with him, and with &s;uch a &s;um, as might an&s;wer his purpo&s;es when he departed. All this was done on no po&s;&s;ible idea of intere&s;t; for the gentleman thus kindly treated, thought he could not deal too candidly in return; therefore, laid before his ho&s;t, previou&s;ly to farther &s;ervices, a true &s;tate of his affairs, which exhibited the near pro&s;pect rather of de&s;pair than hope. Since which di&s;|covery the bounty of the landlord, did not alter its a&s;pect, but rather wore a more be|nignant &s;mile, accompanied by deportment,
<PB N="266" REF="285">that mingled reverence with kindne&s;s. And believe me, this &s;pirit of philanthropy is not confined to in&s;tances like tho&s;e, &s;elected with difficulty, or by the accuracy of <HI>diligent</HI> Glean|ing, but is really, and truly, the liberal and genial growth of this country, in as fair an abundance as that of any other, of whom we &s;peak more vauntingly.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of trade keeps pace then, but does not <HI>out&s;trip</HI> that of courte&s;y. It is incon|ceivable, to tho&s;e who have not been eye wit|ne&s;&s;es, with what unabated energy men of bu&s;ine&s;s traver&s;e this and other commercial parts of Europe. Our Engli&s;h riders, as they are called who travel over Great Britain, &s;eem inert and dead, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e who cro&s;s the water as factors and agents. The unwearied a&s;&s;iduity, with which they attend to all the my&s;teries of trade, the ardour with which they cultivate corre&s;pondence, and en|large the connection of their re&s;pective hou&s;es, the exactne&s;s and di&s;patch, with which they execute orders, the zeal with which they urge gainful enquiry, and the vigour with which they improve every profitable occurrence, every <HI>"golden</HI> opportunity" cannot but attract the notice of a traveller, the mo&s;t di&s;engaged from
<PB N="267" REF="286">public affairs. Viewed only as objects of &s;pe|culative curio&s;ity, this is intere&s;ting, &s;ince, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;troll into any of the public coffee-hou&s;es, walk along the canals, vi&s;it their exchange, or &s;it down at any of the table d'Hotes, of this bu&s;y town, in particular, without being exceedingly &s;truck at the effect, and going into &s;ome enquiry of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Some &s;entiments on this &s;ubject are &s;o appo&s;ite to this cau&s;e, and this effect, on general prin|ciples, that I cannot but apply them in this place, &s;o far as my memory accommodates me, either with them or the language in which they were given to the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. But you &s;hould previou&s;ly under&s;tand, that what the member offered as de&s;criptive of the Briti&s;h empire, I con&s;ider as equally influencing <HI>all</HI> the trading parts of Europe, and in a more e&s;pecial manner the United Provinces.</P>
<P>When we thus &s;ee the revenue, and the trade of every country increa&s;ing, it is natural to enquire into the cau&s;es. Of the&s;e the fir&s;t is undoubtedly the indu&s;try and energy of a country, but there mu&s;t be &s;econdary cau&s;es to give to this its effect, &s;aid one, who
<PB N="268" REF="287">who is not in the habit, as many honourable members are, of &s;acrificing truth to decla|mation. The increa&s;e of &s;kill in artizans and manufacturers, the great improvements in the application of machinery, and the various ways, by which labour is &s;aved, &s;ubdivided, and expedited by ingenuity, have done much in all countries: the facility of credit ari&s;ing from confidence in the public faith, give great advantage to manufactures at <HI>home,</HI> and, by enabling the merchant to extend his credit <HI>abroad,</HI> give no le&s;s advantage in the foreign market, and thus operate in a double ratio.</P>
<P>This is, certainly, fir&s;t the &s;ign, and then the cau&s;e, of national pro&s;perity. The enter|prize of commercial men, pu&s;h adventure, and judicious &s;peculations wherever a market is to be found, or created, and the liberal policy of a more unre&s;trained commerce between nations, have greatly contributed: but more than all other cau&s;es have operated the accumulation of capital, the effects of which were never fully under&s;tood till a philo&s;opher of our own coun|try, the celebrated author of the "wealth of na|tions," with a depth and clearne&s;s of inve&s;ti|gation, fitted to enlighten, and direct, the in|ternal policy of any &s;tate, di&s;covered and
<PB N="269" REF="288">pointed them out. This accumulation operates with all the effect of compound intere&s;t, every addition to it is the immediate cau&s;e of ano|ther, and its force increa&s;es in an accelerated ratio through its progre&s;s.
<Q>"Mobilitate viget, vire&s;que acquiret eundo."</Q> And the&s;e combining cau&s;es, are, mo&s;t indi&s;|putably, productive of tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing effects, which pour not only through our own coun|try, but every other in the trading world, the graces, the riches of each other, in greater abundance, at this very hour, than at any former period of, at lea&s;t modern, and, per|haps, of ancient times.</P>
<P>Of what <HI>farther</HI> it is &s;u&s;ceptible, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;ay: becau&s;e the perfection of National commerce, that bound which it may reach, but may not pa&s;s, cannot ea&s;ily be a&s;certained; but we may fairly a&s;k, if &s;uch are the effects of &s;uch cau&s;es <HI>already,</HI> what, in the progre&s;s of indu&s;try, genius and emulation, may not be expected from them in future! In pro&s;perity <HI>no</HI> limit can be &s;et to national vigour; and in the hour of difficulty, di&s;tre&s;s or danger, as &s;uch vigour is the only mitigation of national evil, it will be exerted in proportion. Far,
<PB N="270" REF="289">therefore, from having reached a point at which it is likely to &s;top, the national pro&s;|perity of a country flowing out of its com|merce, admits yet of encrea&s;e, and though the cau&s;es mu&s;t be permanent, the effects may be progre&s;&s;ive; for, while human &s;kill, in any branch of commodity, is <HI>capable</HI> of improve|ment, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay to what a pitch of wealth and pro&s;perity any trading nation may arrive, by its own energy of advancing.</P>
<P>Holland, it is true, has had at different pe|riods of her hi&s;tory, very heavy drawbacks, as well from within as from without, from the enemy in her own bowels, as from a public invader. Often have the fruits of her genius and indu&s;try been &s;wept away by rebellion and war: often has &s;he been drenched in her own blood: but with all the&s;e depre&s;&s;ions, her efforts re&s;r&s;ted the&s;e calamities, and repaired them &s;o well, that at this very hour, &s;he may &s;tand, perhaps, foremo&s;t among&s;t nations, as an example of human indu&s;try producing hu|man pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of Alexandria, by an an|cient author, has been applied, and ju&s;tly, to this Republic, particularly its capital.
<PB N="271" REF="290">"Rich and opulent Provinces that abound with every thing, and where nobody <HI>can</HI> be idle. The very lame and blind have their exerci&s;es, and u&s;eful occupations, and even tho&s;e who have the gout in their hands, are not &s;uffered to be u&s;ele&s;s. This is &s;o true of Am&s;terdam, that, in almo&s;t every corner of it amazing examples of indu&s;try are to be &s;een, even in tho&s;e who&s;e age, &s;ickne&s;s, and bodily infirmities would obtain a di&s;pen|&s;ation from work, <HI>any where el&s;e.</HI> Tho&s;e who think, therefore, that the Dutch have more of matter than &s;pirit in their com|po&s;ition, may undeceive them&s;elves. Other cities of Europe have had the models of mo&s;t of their u&s;eful contrivances, and ma|chines of various &s;orts from the towns of this Republic.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Rotterdam.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been among&s;t the objects of the&s;e Gleanings, to re&s;cue the inhabitants of the dif|ferent countries in which I &s;ojourn from the undue mea&s;ure of cen&s;ure ca&s;t on them, and to &s;ettle them, without prejudice on the one hand, or partiality on the other, in every candid mind, ju&s;t as they are,
<Q><L>"Nothing extenuated,</L>
<L>"Nor ought &s;et down in malice."</L></Q></P>
<P>The Welch, being part of our&s;elves, &s;uffer little from us on the &s;core of prejudice; and therefore little was left for a liberal traveller to do away. But the Dutch demanded a <HI>&s;turdy</HI> champion, and yet one, who in the zeal of admini&s;t'ring ju&s;tice, avoided flattery. In va|rious in&s;tances, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the Gleaner has approved him&s;elf this even-handed advocate. I tru&s;t he has defended them, where they were defen&s;ible, and blamed them where
<PB N="273" REF="292">they de&s;erved reproach. In the &s;pirit of this principle he began, and will have the hone&s;ty and the fortitude to maintain it unto the end.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other a&s;per&s;ions from which it has been his office to exonerate the people of this country, is their imputed <HI>in&s;en&s;ibility;</HI> an a&s;per|&s;ion which very generally prevails. You find the Gleaner has &s;een their hearts and minds in the operation of various events, as well happy as di&s;a&s;trous. He has had an eye on them, when a man le&s;s impre&s;&s;ed with conviction of the im|portance of <HI>little</HI> things to a&s;certain the great ones of character and principles, would have <HI>overlooked</HI> their feelings. He has ob&s;erved them too, when <HI>great</HI> occurrences called forth their &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, or their mo&s;t &s;ubtle hypo|cri&s;y. In both ca&s;es he has found their affec|tions as powerful, as fervid, as expre&s;&s;ive of upright principles, and of tender emotions, as any of our own.</P>
<P>There are, you know, certain occa&s;ions &s;o ab&s;olutely demon&s;trative of real heart and &s;oul, that the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;embler would find it impo&s;&s;ible to keep <HI>on</HI> his ma&s;k, however ne|ce&s;&s;ary it might be to his intere&s;t, his fame, or even his life. Of this omnipotent cla&s;s of in|cidents
<PB N="274" REF="293">is the <HI>peru&s;al of letters,</HI> the contents of which, as to general &s;en&s;ation, whether of pain or plea&s;ure, is as clearly read by the &s;pectator as by the party concerned: I mean of cour&s;e &s;uch letters as are read in company <HI>immediately</HI> on their being received. Something beyond the power of human re&s;i&s;tance urges a man al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally to open the letters that are brought him by the po&s;t; nay, we often break the &s;eal in&s;en&s;ibly; and the utmo&s;t forbearance which good breeding enjoins, &s;carce ever ex|tends to the putting them <HI>quietly</HI> into our pocket, when, from a recognition of the hand|writing, we expect any thing of heart, or even when we are &s;trangers to the characters of the &s;uper&s;cription. Curio&s;ity &s;eizes us in the one ca&s;e, and more than curio&s;ity in the other. If therefore we <HI>do</HI> gain this degree of good man|ners, it is by a painful exertion, which often makes us wi&s;h our company were at home; though, induced by a &s;ort of fellow-feeling, they often prevent this wi&s;h, by di&s;pen&s;ing with eti|quette, and enjoin the reading our letters.

<PB N="275" REF="294"><HI>Then it is,</HI> that we are perfidious to our tru&s;t, without any other accu&s;ers, any other language than what is furni&s;hed by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our being trick&s;ters, fools, or traitors: &s;o inge|nuous is our <HI>invi&s;ible, bo&s;om</HI> judge, &s;o all-power|ful is con&s;cience; though guilt fir&s;t fa&s;tened her with chains, that very guilt only waits for a fit opportunity to break them a&s;under, and forces the culprit to avow his crime, even to tho&s;e who are &s;ure to puni&s;h it. It is thus that in the act of reading any written mi&s;chief, done, or to be done, con&s;cience flies into the face of the delinquent, &s;eizes every limb of his body, and, by a &s;trange power, renders that countenance <HI>really</HI> hone&s;t, which had be|fore only <HI>appeared</HI> to be &s;o. A young man, for in&s;tance, long lo&s;t to fame and fortune, &s;ud|denly reads of his di&s;inheritance when he ex|pected a remittance&mdash;a broker, of a pro&s;ecution for u&s;ury when he looked for an invitation to meet the party to receive the premium&mdash;the libertine, of di&s;covery by a parent or brother, who &s;ends a challenge, when his heart beat high with
<Q>"expectation of the coming joy."</Q> to be derived from his long-planned &s;e|duction.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="295">But the&s;e examples are, you will &s;ay, &s;o &s;trong, that he who runs may read <HI>them.</HI> Be|lieve me, the &s;ubordinate foibles, and vices are no le&s;s under the dominion of the letters, which, unawares, de&s;cribe their cau&s;es and their effects: in like manner, the <HI>better</HI> parts of our nature are, al&s;o, developed with equal truth and ac|curacy by the &s;ame faithful reporters; and without being endowed with the &s;agacity of Lavater, a quiet ob&s;erver mu&s;t want that de|gree of common &s;en&s;e, in which few are de|ficient, not to a&s;certain the actual &s;tate and &s;trength of tho&s;e natural feelings, the viva|city of that fancy, the &s;en&s;ibility of that heart, which are exhibited by the peru&s;al of letters. The pa&s;&s;ions and emotions are not &s;imply called forth by their proper objects, they are, whe|ther reluctantly or by a&s;&s;ent, placed before our view, by that imperial, and, not &s;eldom, im|perious <HI>law in our &s;ouls,</HI> which is &s;upreme, in|di&s;pen&s;ible, and incorruptible. Hence it is that vice has, in de&s;pite of her&s;elf, and which &s;he &s;hews, perforce, to the innocence &s;he would de&s;troy, and to the Judge who will condemn, her di&s;ordered eye, her livid cheek, her &s;haking joints. And hence too, that virtue &s;hews us her mo&s;t affecting &s;mile, her true&s;t, tendere&s;t tear, her mo&s;t touching blu&s;h, and her noble&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="296">glow of courage, or of benevolence. All is genuine.</P>
<P>To exhibit an in&s;tance of the former&mdash;of <HI>vice betrayed</HI>&mdash;would be irk&s;ome to you, my friend, and to me: to pre&s;ent one of the latter, of <HI>virtue di&s;covered</HI>&mdash;will be alike plea&s;ing to us both.</P>
<P>I have fixed my&s;elf, for the &s;ake of &s;ociety, at the be&s;t inn here, to the intent that while I am &s;hut in by the weather, I may beguile the time I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s within doors, in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant manner, and be at lea&s;t in the <HI>way</HI> of a glean-worthy occurrence. The hou&s;e is, at pre&s;ent, filled by travellers nearly in my own &s;ituation, and glad to find, like my|&s;elf, &s;uch re&s;ources as are within reach. La&s;t night brought us the acqui&s;ition of a lady and gentleman, man and wi&s;e, from Am&s;terdam. They came, at all hazards, on a con&s;iderable emergence, by land. We breakfa&s;ted in the &s;ame party, and &s;eeming to a&s;&s;imilate, with even le&s;s than the u&s;ual &s;light punctilios of a public room, were getting into a cordial con|ver&s;ation, before the forms of the world, in a more private apartment, would have warranted, &s;o tyrannous is cu&s;tom, the opening our lips.
<PB N="278" REF="297">Our di&s;cour&s;e had thawed the very idea of an hard fro&s;t, and of a bad fire, and was, in de|&s;pite of the ice without doors, flowing in full vigour, when the &s;ervant entered from the po&s;t|hou&s;e with <HI>letters,</HI> the very &s;ight of which "checked the genial current" of our conver&s;e. The general pacquet which was addre&s;&s;ed to the hu&s;band, contained &s;everal others, two of which were given immediately to the wife, who, &s;eeing they came from her children, whom &s;he had left, by the bye, only the day before, opened them with an emotion that a man of the dulle&s;t mind mu&s;t have pronounced it a dome&s;tick and maternal emotion. The gra|dations of that colouring which nature painted in her cheeks, as &s;he read, and the eloquence of that &s;ilent felicity which illumined her countenance in the progre&s;s of the peru&s;al of her papers, manife&s;ted that they came from parties very near, and dear to her heart; and to you, who love to look at the happy, would have furni&s;hed &s;uch a regale, that I wi&s;hed then, and cannot help wi&s;hing &s;till, you had partaken of our breakfa&s;t. The letters were from two daughters, the one written in pro&s;e, and the other in ver&s;e; but both expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame duty and affection, and both upon the &s;ame intere&s;ting &s;ubject&mdash;the gratulation of children
<PB N="279" REF="298">on the anniver&s;ary of their mother's birth, a day which had u&s;ually been celebrated at home in pre&s;ence of the whole family, but which the&s;e worthy parts of it were re&s;olved &s;hould not pa&s;s without at lea&s;t &s;uch marks of tribu|tary honour as they could confer in ab&s;ence. Happine&s;s is communicative: in the overflow of the heart, the mother detailed, with a pro|lixity natural to parents, and even to felicity, the cau&s;es of her joy. She ju&s;tified therein the effects; but after all, &s;he could only give me the particulars of bli&s;s, the general &s;ubject of which &s;he had before &s;o well di&s;covered by a language unborrowed of the tongue.</P>
<P>Her &s;tory was a fre&s;h proof of my po&s;ition, viz. that the moments of receiving and reading a corre&s;pondence of the affections, <HI>whether good or bad,</HI> are the moments in which the characters of the &s;oul are to be peru&s;ed, and e&s;timated. The lady entered upon her &s;ubject <HI>con amore, et con &s;pirito,</HI> telling me, with all a mother's glow, that both her daughters were the be&s;t girls in the world, but that the author of the anniver&s;ary addre&s;s had the &s;en&s;e of an angel; and &s;he wi&s;hed, with all her heart, I under&s;tood &s;ufficiently the Dutch language to read the ver&s;es&mdash;<Q>and the other dear creature, though
<PB N="280" REF="299">no poet, is no le&s;s clever, no le&s;s good; here now, &s;ir, is a letter written with the &s;olidity and correctne&s;s that would do honour to my elde&s;t &s;on, whom, every body &s;ays, is a won|der for his age.</Q></P>
<P>The hu&s;band's looks corroborated the eulogy of the wife; and the breakfa&s;t, which had been impeded by this letter-reading &s;cene, now went on. Before the po&s;tman appeared, they &s;eemed to have a reli&s;h for the repa&s;t; but &s;udden emo|tions, purely of the mind, whether of pain or of plea&s;ure, are, for the moment, no way fa|vourable to the common bodily appetites. The toa&s;t which I had made for them <HI>in the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion</HI>&mdash;a rarity here&mdash;and which was thought delicious, had now lo&s;t its charm, or, rather, had given place to a much more potent en|chantment; the free will offering of the duti|ful daughter had introduced a much more agreeable banquet. <Q>I have (&s;aid this fond mother) been in many re&s;pects, and I am &s;till in &s;ome, a mo&s;t fortunate parent; but, in one in&s;tance, O my God, how mi&s;erable! That rapacious tyrant, the &s;mall-pox, &s;natched from me a girl who&mdash;parental tenderne&s;s apart, or allowed for in its fulle&s;t extent&mdash; was not only the pride, the glory of our fond
<PB N="281" REF="300">bo&s;oms&mdash;(<HI>here the hu&s;band began to cough</HI>)&mdash;but the delight of all who knew her: full of goodne&s;s, of talents, and of beauty, &s;he was the very boa&s;t of our whole city; yet we were bereaved of her in le&s;s than a fortnight after we had celebrated, in an a&s;&s;embly of all her little friends, the day at which &s;he gained her fifteenth year.</Q></P>
<P>"Our only con&s;olation," &s;aid the hu&s;band, (filling up a pau&s;e, which &s;orrow made in the account of his wife&mdash;yet filling it up with a voice that faultered)&mdash;<Q>our only con&s;olation is, that the la&s;t moments of her un&s;ullied life were employed in acts of filial love. Her death, &s;ir, which it almo&s;t kills me to think on, her death, happened in the middle of the night. The chamber had been darkened at her reque&s;t &s;ome time before; but &s;he now felt the fa&s;t approaches of her di&s;&s;olution, and de&s;ired the light might be brought into the room. When it came&mdash;pray bring it nearer, &s;aid the poor thing&mdash;nearer &s;till&mdash;my eyes grow more dim every in&s;tant, and ere they quite fail me, I would wi&s;h their la&s;t office might be to &s;hew me their ever-deare&s;t objects, my parents and &s;i&s;ters; I grieve that
<PB N="282" REF="301">ab&s;ence prevents them from once more be|holding my brother.</Q></P>
<P>Here the hu&s;band lo&s;t his voice in &s;oftne&s;s; and the wi&s;e took up the &s;orrow-moving tale, by exclaiming, <Q>O dreadful, yet dear, mo|ment! when my dying Anna found that &s;he &s;till wanted light to di&s;tingui&s;h us, &s;he begged the candle might be put into her own trem|bling hand, and after &s;he had looked a little while mo&s;t earne&s;tly in our faces, wiping away the tears that were running along her poor father's cheeks, and then ki&s;&s;ing us all &s;everal times, &s;he returned the candle, &s;aying&mdash;I am now &s;atisfied, and am on the edge of the everla&s;ting man&s;ions of my Father which is in heaven&mdash;the only parent whom I <HI>could</HI> go to with gain, after the lo&s;s of tho&s;e I am now leaving.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Do you remember her look while &s;he ut|tered this?</Q> &s;aid the wife to the hu&s;band.&mdash; "Remember it! O God!" exclaimed the lat|ter, in a bur&s;t of angui&s;h that atte&s;ted the too|faithful integrity of his recollection&mdash;<Q>Were not her hands, her eyes lifted up towards heaven?&mdash;the doors of which were opened, &s;he a&s;&s;ured us, to receive her? Seraphs, cried
<PB N="283" REF="302">the <HI>almo&s;t</HI> cherubim, are thronging to give me welcome, and Almighty God him&s;elf invites me to enter.</Q></P>
<P>"It was, at this aweful cri&s;is," &s;aid the mother in great agitation, <Q>that my departed Anna, conflicted with the powers of death, to rai&s;e her&s;elf on her knees, in the attempt of which &s;he fell, and under our &s;upport, invoked a ble&s;&s;ing on us both! In our very arms &s;he expired, and we thought the &s;pot where &s;he yielded up her innocent being, would have been the general death-bed of the family!</Q></P>
<P>The hu&s;band covered his face with his hands; the wife, after looking &s;teadfa&s;tly at the fire, without, perhaps, &s;eeing it&mdash;ejaculated at length "God's will be done!" and left the room.</P>
<P>When alone, I repeated aloud a ver&s;e which I had often felt, in reading that part of our Night Thoughts which mourns Narci&s;&s;a, but had never before &s;een occa&s;ion &s;o forcibly to apply it:&mdash;
<Q>"Ye, that e'er lo&s;t an angel, pity <HI>them!"</HI></Q></P>
<P>Never did hearts, in the warme&s;t country, under the mo&s;t unclouded &s;ky, beat higher&mdash;
<PB N="284" REF="303">never did eyes more copiou&s;ly &s;tream in token of that grief which "pa&s;&s;eth &s;hew." Away with di&s;tinctions! with appropriations! and all the offspring of &s;elf love!&mdash;Education, cu&s;tom, example, may do much&mdash;climate may have its power&mdash;the &s;un may animate&mdash;the ice may chill&mdash;but there are, in <HI>all</HI> countries, mo|ments and events, which render <HI>all</HI> good be|ings the &s;ame, and prove us, through all the zones, allied clo&s;ely to one another!</P>
<P>With re&s;pect, however, to the <HI>countenances</HI> of the Dutch, they are certainly not, generally, lively indexes of tho&s;e affections which they frequently cover. Tho&s;e affections are, in their &s;till life, often extremely hid from ob&s;erva|tion, and you will &s;ee fifty or an hundred men, with pipes in their mouths, and as many women &s;tewing over their &s;toves, pa&s;s hours away in one another's company, with &s;carce the utterance of a &s;yllable, change of a po&s;|ture, or variation of a feature; yet, in a &s;e|ries of remarks, I have followed &s;everal of the&s;e very per&s;ons into their dome&s;tic circles, and have <HI>there</HI> &s;een, as in the ca&s;e above cited, the kinde&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t emotions, of which the human heart is capable, fly out, according to circum&s;tances and occurrences, with an
<PB N="285" REF="304">energy, a vivacity, an eloquence, of which, from general appearances and &s;peculations, not even the pervading eye of Lavater could have any pre&s;cience.</P>
<P>We will now advert to a few more of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, among&s;t which mu&s;t be reckoned the travelling <HI>expences,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the table d'hotes.</P>
<P>The&s;e have been very erroneou&s;ly &s;tated. The mo&s;t diligent in&s;pection has enabled me to offer you the following table of charges, which, with a variation not worth noticing in a few hou&s;es, may be depended upon as your <HI>general directory</HI> in the tour of the Provinces.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Rotterdam.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>STILL under double lock, as it were, of fro&s;t and &s;now, I &s;ee not how I can &s;o u&s;e|fully employ the lei&s;ure which the&s;e impedi|ments have thrown into my hands, as offering you a &s;ummary account of the provinces that con&s;titute the&s;e celebrated States, in which &s;ummary, I tru&s;t, you will gain a di&s;tinct idea of the divi&s;ions, privileges, and re&s;pective powers of the Republic; the connection of the parts, with the whole; and whatever el&s;e it befits a traveller, who has any laudable cu|rio&s;ity, to know.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, by &s;ketches of their ancient and modern hi&s;tory, in the cour&s;e of our fir&s;t &s;heaf, that the indu&s;try and labours of the inhabitants of the States have been united and ince&s;&s;ant; that if, upon the whole, they breathe a more heavy air, or tread, and dre&s;s, a more difficult &s;oil&mdash;if their exterior is more rude, le&s;s brilliant, le&s;s gay, than that of
<PB N="288" REF="307">their neighbours farther &s;outh, nature has en|dowed them with the more &s;olid, and, perhaps, more de&s;ireable, certainly more u&s;eful, powers of con&s;tancy and application.&mdash;If they have been, at all times, &s;low in taking their be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures, they have the faculty of holding to them, when taken, more re&s;olutely than quicker minds; and to this unrelaxing per&s;everance, this characteri&s;tic &s;teadine&s;s, we owe the almo&s;t miracles they have performed in agriculture, arms, and arts, without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, from tho&s;e &s;prightly talents which have been &s;o much relied upon in other countries.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to agriculture, without que&s;|tion, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary art of human life, they have arrived at a wonderful degree of per|fection; in which prai&s;e we are to include, not only the &s;even provinces, and their ap|pendages, but the ten others which con&s;titute the whole of the Netherlands, who&s;e farmers and hu&s;bandmen, of every de&s;cription, may vie with tho&s;e of any country in the world. In various other parts of Europe, the &s;oil is more genial, and in every re&s;pect more highly fa|voured by nature, but in none is it better cul|tivaited by art: indeed, it may be ob&s;erved,
<PB N="289" REF="308">that in every part of the earth where the lea&s;t labour is required, the natives, either from that very rea&s;on, or from the influence of &s;often air, and inten&s;er &s;uns, are le&s;s inclined to, and, perhaps, le&s;s capable of toil: whereas, tho&s;e who are the growth of a land to which na|ture has denied the&s;e indulgencies, are endow|ed with a good con&s;titution, and a good will to &s;upply the deficiencies, by dint of that la|bour which contributes at once to their pro&s;|perity, and the &s;trength by which it is gained. In Gleaning the lands belonging to the Dutch, I have often pa&s;&s;ed over places now blooming with culture, or gay with the magnificence of palaces; &s;o indeed may whole &s;treets in &s;ome of the great towns be called, I have trod on ground, at <HI>this</HI> time waving in plenty, which nature her&s;elf &s;eemed to con&s;ider unworthy to be the re&s;idence of her lea&s;t valued produc|tions, having &s;unk whole leagues either in bogs or quick&s;ands, a dark and &s;terile tract, where the very weeds refu&s;ed to grow&mdash;nay, their fir&s;t and mo&s;t important city, which may now be called one of the grand &s;tore-hou&s;es of the univer&s;e. Am&s;terdam it&s;elf was once a mere quagmire, the abode only of the mo&s;t loath|&s;ome animals.&mdash;In a word, there never was, perhaps, a &s;oil &s;o barren, &s;o ungrateful, as that
<PB N="290" REF="309">which hath been &s;ubdued by the Hollander, wherever he has laid his indefatigable and pa|tient hand.</P>
<P>Of their prowe&s;s in <HI>arms</HI> every country is con&s;cious. Their <HI>literature</HI> is not contemp|tible, and their <HI>commerce</HI>&mdash;another proof of their inflexible diligence&mdash;&s;urpa&s;&s;es that of Ve|nice, or any Republic on the face of the globe. What &s;ea hath not been, and is not &s;till, co|vered with their &s;ails? Into what country have they not penetrated? Where is it, that they have not e&s;tabli&s;hed a factory, or a connexion? What &s;ort of trade is unknown, or untried by them? Is there a climate, or a corner of the univer&s;e, which, in &s;ome &s;ort, is not, or has not been, obliged to pay tribute to their indu&s;try? What a countle&s;s number of ve&s;&s;els touch at, or are a part of, the property of their ports? Have they not intere&s;ts, and intercour&s;e, with nations who affect to de&s;pi&s;e them? and who yet take refuge in their indu&s;try, to be fur|ni&s;hed with what their own idlene&s;s and effe|minacy denies?</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the &s;acred love of free|dom, is there, has there ever been, a people on earth, in whom the pa&s;&s;ion for liberty was
<PB N="291" REF="310">more con&s;picuous? It is with rea&s;on that they have been accu&s;ed of having often carried the <HI>amor patriae</HI> too far, and not &s;eldom of having mi&s;taken it: but, even their misfortunes and mi&s;takes, proceeding from their many public or private wars, could never vanqui&s;h the un|conquerable &s;pirit of indu&s;try. In common with their Flemi&s;h neighbours, their little &s;peck of watery land, has, for ages, been fought for; and whenever the ravages of u&s;urpation, trea&s;on, or other cau&s;es, have laid their cities low, and their country wa&s;te, they have rebuilt the one, and repleni&s;hed the other, with a de|gree of re&s;olute determination not to be &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed in the arts of indu&s;try, whatever they may be in the arts of de&s;truction.&mdash;In a word, my dear-loved corre&s;pondent, &s;ince my re&s;idence in, and rambles about, this curious country, &s;o little indebted to nature, and &s;o un&s;peakably obliged to art, I have, times beyond number|ing, reflected on tho&s;e delightful lines of our delicious Thom&s;on, where the effects of that very power (by which no le&s;s in our own country, than in the&s;e provinces, &s;uch wonders have been atchieved) are traced with &s;o ma&s;|terly a hand. Let me beg of you to accept them, not only with a view to their exact ap|plication to the people we have been treating
<PB N="292" REF="311">of, but to give you that plea&s;ure which a man of your ju&s;t ta&s;te mu&s;t derive from every fre&s;h view of exqui&s;ite painting. I by no means wi&s;h to rob England of its original right to the de&s;cription; but, whoever vi&s;its Holland, will have rea&s;on to confe&s;s that every line has its force, its beauty, and its truth, as applied to what will there be met with.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="313">Of the &s;even counties, that of Holland is the mo&s;t powerful and flouri&s;hing; and accord|ingly the &s;ingle city of Am&s;terdam contributes for the &s;upport of the States more than &s;ixteen millions of florins yearly. Notwith&s;tanding which, it holds only the fifth rank in the A&s;|&s;embly of their High Mightine&s;&s;es, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed only by the privilege of &s;ending two deputies more than any of the other towns. So much has been &s;aid of this particular pro|vince in my general Gleanings, of what re|lated to the Stadtholder and States General, that we may pa&s;s on to the next in order, after we have noticed two points that were omitted in our former de&s;criptions&mdash;the taxes and the &s;tate of religion.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it is certain there is <HI>not a country in the world</HI> more heavily charged with impo&s;ts than that of the Dutch, e&s;pecially in the province of Holland. Bread, wine, beer, fi&s;h, fle&s;h, fowl, fruits, vegetables, fire, and in &s;hort almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary of life, are all onerated, and with a rigour as if they were &s;o many luxuries. The&s;e taxes amount to a third of the value of the commodity, to be paid by tho&s;e who &s;ell, and con&s;equently by tho&s;e who buy, as the &s;eller rai&s;es the price of each ar|ticle
<PB N="295" REF="314">in proportion. If among&s;t the cavils which were made again&s;t Old England, we are to reckon tho&s;e which proceed from taxations, it may afford the murmurers &s;ome con&s;olation to under&s;tand that their near neighbours are burthened yet more &s;everely than them&s;elves, and that it would be difficult to mention a &s;ingle article which has e&s;caped&mdash;&s;alt, &s;oap, TOBACCO, one of <HI>their</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;aries,&mdash; tea, coffee, chocolate, ma&s;ters, &s;ervants, carts, coaches, hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, hou&s;e, and land, all go to the maintenance of the Republic, on a principle of literally, <HI>&s;tate nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> The tax on hou&s;es augments, or dimini&s;hes, according to their &s;ituation, their magnificence, and the date of their erection.</P>
<P>In any great emergence, their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es levy the hundredth, or the two hundredth, part on the whole property of the inhabitants given on the oath of each individual. The duty on all &s;tamps is, in it&s;elf, a very great re|venue, and &s;o &s;trictly guarded, that neither fa|vour nor fine&s;&s;e can find a loop-hole to creep out, and all contracts, public or private, not made upon &s;tampt paper, are not only void, but the offenders puni&s;hed with all the rigours
<PB N="296" REF="315">of the law, which rigours, by the bye, are fre|quently put in force.</P>
<P>The duties on Holland, as the mo&s;t opulent province, con&s;titutes the half of what is pro|duced to government by the whole of the Re|public: and after Holland, the mo&s;t burthened is Friezeland, then Zealand. We have been told, that during the war with England, in 1665, they rai&s;ed double the ordinary revenue, which is allowed to be near two millions &s;ter|ling; and it has been &s;aid, that on the occa|&s;ion of the la&s;t general war, which began in 1702, and ended in 1713, they rai&s;ed near five millions &s;terling every year, which the finan|ciers of the country a&s;&s;ert is the utmo&s;t &s;um of which the States are capable. The proportion between this Republic, and England, is calcu|lated as five to &s;even; that is, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ubject equally burthened.</P>
<P>But they have favoured their great &s;ource of trade as much as po&s;&s;ible, rai&s;ing rather by ex|ci&s;es than cu&s;toms, for fear, &s;ays Carter, of driving &s;o un&s;table a traveller into other coun|tries. This indulgence &s;hewn to what may, properly, be called their &s;taple commodity, (commerce) is according to a maxim of two
<PB N="297" REF="316">of their mo&s;t illu&s;trious Republicans. "In Hollandia et Zelandia, etiam nuptiis tri|butum impo&s;itum; &s;ed me mori quidem ibi licet impune," &s;ays BYNHERSHOECK.</P>
<P>Some articles, &s;uch as &s;alt, is taxed <HI>whether con&s;umed or not.</HI> All &s;ales of moveables, com|prehending grain, cattle, and all produce of land, pay the 80th penny; hor&s;es the 12th; immovables the 40th.</P>
<P>A very ingenious writer, by way <HI>al&s;o</HI> of con|&s;oling the Engli&s;h reader, has detailed, and with great accuracy, &s;ome of the taxes I have not hitherto noticed.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance. The land-tax is two florins &s;ixteen &s;tivers per acre; the dykes two florins three &s;tivers and rent about 20s. per acre.</P>
<P>Hou&s;es pay as far as 40l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>One of their mo&s;t &s;ingular impo&s;ts is what they call a <HI>collateral tax,</HI> which is a levy on in|heritants out of the direct line, laid in the pro|vince where the <HI>property,</HI> not the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> of the decea&s;ed was lodged. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to bring,
<PB N="298" REF="317">in the cour&s;e of a few generations, all private property into the coffers of the public.</P>
<P>There is a tax of 2l. per cent. <HI>on every man's income,</HI> &s;tated on oath. Wine pays an exci&s;e of 3l. per hog&s;head. Small beer 50 per cent. another of 2 per cent. on the revenue of all offices, excepting tho&s;e in the army. This is called <HI>Acmpt Geldt;</HI> that on income, <HI>Famille Geldt.</HI></P>
<P>Every man, appointed to an office, mu&s;t buy &s;tocks to a certain amount, and tear the bonds, which renders offices a kind of annuity, yield|ing to the purcha&s;er about 12 or 14 l. per cent. This tax is named <HI>Aempt Obligaties,</HI> or recog|nitions.</P>
<P>All manufactures, u&s;ed in the country, pay exorbitant charges, to &s;pare tho&s;e levied by the &s;everal admiralties; and the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company pays, as a compen&s;ation for its charter, about 36,000l. &s;terling annually: but, in addition, each &s;hare of 6000 florins pays 480 florins annually, whether there is a dividend or not.</P>
<P>The revenues, therefore, if we include what is paid to the &s;everal towns and corporations, may be e&s;timated at about 24 <HI>millions of florins,</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="318">levied on a population of about 800,000 <HI>&s;ouls:</HI> &s;o that, on an average, each per&s;on contri|butes about thirty florins, or two guineas and an half Engli&s;h, when exchange is mo&s;t in our favour. An immen&s;e &s;um, if we con&s;ider place and people; yet the Republic not only &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts, and moves, but <HI>flouri&s;hes</HI>&mdash;not, however, without heavy

Inveterately &s;ixed in general habits and opinions; in politicks they are capricious and changeable.</NOTE> murmuring, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently. The lo&s;&s;es, we are told, &s;u&s;tained by their Ea&s;t India Company, &s;ince the year 1780, in con&s;equence of the rupture with England, amounted to about &s;eventy millions of florins, equal to about &s;ix millions, one hundred and twenty-five pounds &s;terling, reckoning the florin at its u&s;ual rate.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the different reports that are made of the <HI>religion</HI> of the States, whether e&s;tabli&s;hed or permitted, I find the following account to be the be&s;t, becau&s;e the true&s;t.</P>
<P>The prevailing religion, is, you know, that of Calvin, though every other &s;ect is tolerated. Jews, Lutherans, Anabapti&s;ts, &amp;c. hold their a&s;&s;emblies, without any interruption from the
<PB N="300" REF="319">Dutch government. Tho&s;e of the Catholic religion are the lea&s;t favoured, not that they are di&s;turbed in the exerci&s;e of their particular faith, but that they have few privileges, and tho&s;e few at the option, &s;ometimes at the ca|price of the magi&s;trates, who, more than &s;el|dom, exerci&s;e their authority with tyranny. In the little province of Drenthe, for in&s;tance, if a Catholic prie&s;t &s;tays longer than one night at any one place, it is at the ri&s;que of his life, &s;o that he is obliged to hurry over his reli|gious duties, and admini&s;ter the &s;acramental elements with more ha&s;te than is con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of &s;uch pious ceremonies. Even in Am&s;terdam, where the Roman Catho|lics are in prodigious numbers, they are obliged to perform their religious exerci&s;es in private hou&s;es, having no public churches or chapels appropriated to their u&s;e in that great city, although, when they did, it is permitted for them to have burial in the ground apper|taining to the reformed churches. It either is, or looks rigorous in a Republic, avow|ing univer&s;al toleration, that, in &s;ome towns, the people of different per&s;ua&s;ions are obliged to pay a <HI>very heavy tax</HI> for the free con|fe&s;&s;ion of their faith, and even in the pro|vinces, where they are treated with the lea&s;t
<PB N="301" REF="320">a&s;perity, the Dutch have an eye upon them as per&s;ons rather &s;uffered than de&s;ired. The Ca|tholic prie&s;ts are con&s;trained, moreover, to wear a &s;ecular dre&s;s. In &s;piritual affairs they had been a long while governed by an apo&s;tolic vicar, &s;ent by the Pope, with permi&s;&s;ion, or ra|ther as you may gather from what has been &s;aid, with the toleration, and <HI>endurance</HI> of the States-General. The la&s;t of the&s;e vicars, was John Van Bylvelt, appointed by Pope Clement the XI. but &s;ince his decea&s;e, which happened in 1727, they have been under the juri&s;diction of a Cardinal, or an Inter-Nuncio, who is not a little put to it frequently, to &s;ettle the differ|ences which &s;ub&s;i&s;t either among&s;t them&s;elves, or the Dutch prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Prote&s;tant clergy of the Provinces, they are without any &s;ort of autho|rity in the Republic. All the mini&s;ters among&s;t them are equal, and wholly independent on each other. Neither at their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical meetings, is there any &s;ort of precedence, ex|cept that of &s;eniority; in which ca&s;e, young divines &s;ettled in the great towns, however popular they may be in other re&s;pects, are obliged to give place to the poore&s;t curate of the poore&s;t village, who is of longer &s;tanding
<PB N="302" REF="321">in the church. They know nothing of the titular di&s;tinctions of bi&s;hop, &s;uperintendant, or director-general, in u&s;age among&s;t other Prote&s;tant countries. Their appointments are fixed at &s;mall &s;alaries, the greate&s;t not exceed|ing two thou&s;and florins, but they are paid with &s;crupulous exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the United Provinces are admitted four Eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, the names of which are, the Con&s;i&s;tory, the Cla&s;&s;es, the Provincial Synod, and the National Synod. The three fir&s;t con&s;titute the Ordinary A&s;&s;embly, and the fourth is the Extraordinary; which is, there|fore, never held but on great occa&s;ions and emergencies. But even in the direction of all the&s;e, the magi&s;trates of each town have very con&s;iderable influence, whenever they think fit to a&s;&s;ert it. This, of cour&s;e, as magi&s;trates have always the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ometimes the weakne&s;&s;es of common men, is con&s;idered as another grievance, incon&s;i&s;tent with that free|dom of con&s;cience, of which every whole&s;ome &s;tate, particularly one founded on Republican principles, ought to be jealous; le&s;t, therefore, you &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e from the intermeddling, or u&s;urpation, or authority, of the&s;e powerful civil magi&s;trates, more de&s;poti&s;m than is prac|ti&s;ed;
<PB N="303" REF="322">I will &s;et down the character given them, by Saint Evremond; becau&s;e, after very dili|gently watching their conduct, I can a&s;&s;ure you, it is not more candid than ju&s;t. I have, in a former letter, ob&s;erved to you, that this writer took refuge, and became re&s;identiary in Holland, to avoid the Ba&s;tile, with who&s;e pains and penalties he was threatened.</P>
<P>"After having lived, &s;ays he, in the con|&s;traint of courts, I feel plea&s;ed at the thought of ending my days in the liberty of a Republic; where, if I have nothing to hope, I have no|thing to fear. The magi&s;trates here, de&s;erve what I &s;hall &s;ay of them. You do not &s;ee among&s;t them tho&s;e hateful di&s;tinctions which are &s;o wounding to an hone&s;t mind, con&s;cious of its own dignity; no u&s;ele&s;s pomps and va|nities of exterior which are di&s;advantageous to the true ideas of liberty, without advancing fortune. The magi&s;trates here, &s;ecure to us the repo&s;e of a wi&s;e police, without expecting that mi&s;erable pro&s;tration, which &s;ullies the benefits we receive from many other govern|ments, which, indeed, &s;ullies our own nature. We pay even too dearly for liberty, at lea&s;t for &s;ecurity, when we purcha&s;e it at the price of our manly principles. This is rarely the
<PB N="304" REF="323">ca&s;e with the people in power here. In the internal legi&s;lation they are &s;trict even to &s;e|verity; they are proud in their treaties with other countries; but it is a pride founded on the ba&s;is of Republican dignity; but they do bu&s;ine&s;s with each other, and enter into the various intere&s;ts of their fellow citizens, with|out any ab&s;urd parade, or idle expectations of &s;uperfluous homage."</P>
<P>It hence appears, that they maintain the very difficult art of blending power with equality; an art by which, thus managed, authority may be a&s;&s;erted without in&s;olence, and the prerogative of magi&s;tracy &s;upported without trenching on the hone&s;t privileges of the people. Every thing beyond this is con|fu&s;ion, tyranny, and fraud, whether exerci&s;ed by people, or magi&s;trate. The world is filled with in&s;tances, which, are, indeed, co-eval almo&s;t with the world it&s;elf; and yet, my friend, notwith&s;tanding them all, the dreadful times before us, &s;hew, that neither the magi&s;trates, nor the people of Holland, or of France, have profited &s;o much as they might have done from &s;uch multitude of examples: or, at lea&s;t, have been able to prevent tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which cer|tain daring &s;pirits, mixing with a mob, are
<PB N="305" REF="324">daily introducing. The truth is, there is not &s;uch a mon&s;ter in created Nature, as he who <HI>mi&s;takes the true</HI> and adopts the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> ideas of <HI>liberty;</HI> nor one &s;o capable of doing mi&s;chief to others and to him&s;elf. Of this hereafter. Zealand, now commands our attention. Its extent is only &s;ixty miles, yet, within that narrow &s;pace, is contained eight capital towns, and above an hundred villages, without count|ing the many, which, at different times, were de&s;troyed, and &s;wallowed by inundations. The government is on the footing with that of Hol|land. The States of Zealand a&s;&s;emble at Middlebourg, the capital. Tho&s;e States are compo&s;ed of the deputies of &s;ix principal towns: but, though one would think they were competent to try civil cau&s;es belonging to their own Province, all &s;uch are judged at the Hague: yet they have what is called the Council of Flanders, compo&s;ed of nine Coun&s;ellors, a Pre&s;ident, a Fi&s;cal, a Collector, and a Greffier, or Secretary of the Province, re&s;iding at Middlebourg. In times pa&s;t, the Zealanders di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the wars with Spain, and in various naval engagements. They are, now, no le&s;s remarkable for their maritime commerce, and are a very indu&s;trious, as well as brave people. In the i&s;les of this Province,
<PB N="306" REF="325">&s;tood, formerly, the town of Rommer&s;wael, the very traces of which have been buried, long &s;ince, in a watery grave. Between the years 1551, and 1563, it was &s;ix times laid under water by the furious inroads of the &s;ea, who&s;e waves have been known to ri&s;e twelve feet above the highe&s;t ground, whereon the church was built. The town hou&s;e was, by the&s;e re|peated inundations, wholly undermined. In 1634, the States of Zealand, which had, from time to time, advanced large &s;ums, by way of loan, to this unfortunate town, (again&s;t which the ocean had &s;o <HI>often</HI> declared war) con&s;idered it as in a &s;tate of bankruptcy; and, however ridiculous it may &s;eem, took out a bill of in|&s;olvency again&s;t its mi&s;erable wreck; for they converted the very &s;tones of the &s;treets, and a few &s;eattered ruins into a &s;um of money, which they appropriated as creditors; although it amounted only to 540 florins, 18 &s;tivers, about eight and forty pounds; a &s;lender dividend among&s;t &s;o many rapacious claimants!</P>
<P>The celebrated little port of <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> is &s;ituated in this county. A beautiful arm of the &s;ea flows through the whole town, which is, therefore, rich and agreeable; for &s;hips of burthen &s;ail with their freights to the very door
<PB N="307" REF="326">of the merchant. The hi&s;tory of its revolution having little more than what has been the fate of almo&s;t every other place worth quarrelling for, I &s;hall pa&s;s over, but that you may be no lo&s;er, &s;hall dwell with fonder delay, on what will more intere&s;t you than a meagre account of victory and defeat.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hing is the birth place of Admiral de Ruyter, of whom I have already had oc|ca&s;ion to make honourable mention. Have you ever met with the following epigram written &s;oon after his death, which happened at Syracu&s;e, in con&s;equence of the wounds he received in an engagement with the French, under command of the famous Abraham du Que&s;ne, before the town of Aou&s;te in Sicily?
<Q><L>TERRUI in Oceano jam &s;olo nomine cla&s;&s;es:</L>
<L>TER nunc in Slculo TERRITUS ip&s;e RUI</L>
<L>Si vera inver&s;um quondam dedit omina nomen</L>
<L>Nunc RUI-TER nomen verius omen habet.</L></Q> Of Abraham du Que&s;ne, who had the honour of conquering De Ruyter, there is a curious anecdote that de&s;erves mention. He was a Norman gentleman, and a Prote&s;tant, but had, neverthele&s;s, greater claims on Louis the Four|teenth, whom he &s;erved, than mo&s;t of the
<PB N="308" REF="327">Catholic Admirals of France. The number and magnitude of his &s;ervices ju&s;tly <HI>entitled</HI> him to the patronage of his king, of whom he &s;ollicited the dignity of Mare&s;chal of France. Your religion, &s;aid Louis, &s;tands in the way of your appointment to that office. What! Sire, an&s;wered the Admiral, I find then, that though my religion did not hinder me from giving your maje&s;ty my &s;ervices, yours prevents you from <HI>rewarding</HI> them.</P>
<P>As a &s;alvo, the king pre&s;ented him with a very fine e&s;tate in one of the faire&s;t parts of his kingdom, and which was rai&s;ed &s;oon after to a marqui&s;ate, bearing the name of Du Que&s;ne.</P>
<P>The remains of the hou&s;e where De Ruyter was born, is pre&s;erved with care, and &s;hewn to the traveller with triumph.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome very pretty &s;cenery in Zea|land, that might furni&s;h the poets, or the painters, with good land&s;capes,
<Q>"Live in de&s;cription, and look green in &s;ong."</Q> There are, al&s;o, &s;ome very fine churches and town halls, the be&s;t of which are tho&s;e of Middleburg, Trevor, and Flu&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="328">The next Province in rank is Utrecht, and though one of the &s;malle&s;t, was, formerly, of &s;uch con&s;equence, as to rai&s;e, and maintain, an army of forty thou&s;and able men. In that pui&s;&s;ant period of its hi&s;tory, the Bi&s;hops of Utrecht had it in domination, and called them&s;elves the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. This &s;overeignty was given to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, by Charlemagne, the Emperor, as a reward for their having laboured the conver&s;ion of the In&s;idels. The rapacious, or if you will, the victorious, Louis XIV. at the head of an hun|dred thou&s;and men, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole of this Province, and of the greater part of Overy&s;&s;el, Guelderland, and Holland, in 1672, in le&s;s than a month; which gave ri&s;e to the following couplet.</P>

I offer it to you only to &s;hew how the poets of France, as well as tho&s;e of our own country, can pro&s;titute their art at the &s;hrine of greatne&s;s; and furthermore, to ob&s;erve, how delighted greatne&s;s &s;ometimes is with little things! It is &s;aid the flattered monarch ap|pointed the author of the&s;e adulatory lines to a place in his hou&s;ehold, worth three thou&s;and livres a-year! The ver&s;es are not worth three &s;ols.</P>
<P>But, what yet more &s;trongly exhibits the va|nity of conque&s;t, and the ambitious avarice of conquerors, all the&s;e places &s;o rapidly &s;ub|dued, were as rapidly, given up, after the &s;overeign had done all the mi&s;chief he could by demoli&s;hing the fortifications and impo|veri&s;hing the people! Thus it is, that the rage of plunder &s;ucceeds to that of blood, and that what is begun by ambition, continued by avarice, and clo&s;ed in robbery, forms an hero, and obtains immortal honour, in <HI>military</HI> affairs, although in <HI>civil</HI> ones, any one of them would conduct a man to the gallows; and gibbet his name and memory, to after times, as an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and a thief!</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330">With re&s;pect to the capital of this Province, (which is in the beaten road of almo&s;t <HI>all</HI> travellers, and which has been written about by &s;o many) you have, doubtle&s;s, often read, and heard, that, though it has not one remarkable &s;tructure, except the &s;teeple of the Cathedral, of which I &s;end you an engraving; it has the reputation, and, perhaps, de&s;ervedly, of being one of the mo&s;t beautiful cities of modern Europe; that it is larger than the Hague, and di&s;putes with it the palm of fa&s;hion and ele|gance, that it commands, from &s;ome of its eminences, fifty-one walled towns, all being within a day's journey, that it has to boa&s;t an univer&s;ity, out of which have been given to the world &s;ome of its mo&s;t u&s;eful and ornamental members; that it was the re&s;idence of the learned, pious, and humble Pope Adrian, who has, ju&s;tly, been called the worthie&s;t Pontiff that ever graced the See of Rome; and who was deemed by the emperor Maximilian, the only fit per&s;on to be tru&s;ted with the edu|cation of his grand&s;on, Charles the Fifth. Nor can you be ignorant, that this city will for ever be execrated by Britons, on account of the <HI>Barrier Treaty;</HI> and no le&s;s reverenced by, at lea&s;t, <HI>one</HI> party of Dutchmen for the ce|lebrated <HI>union.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="331">Of the fir&s;t, our Engli&s;h hi&s;tories are too full for any thing to be added, and perhaps it is among&s;t the IMPOLICIES of government, which it would be as well to forget, &s;ince it is not without rea&s;on, politicians, of all countries, have attributed to this treaty many of the di&s;|graceful difficulties Great Britain has &s;ince groaned under, and many which are probably in advance.</P>
<P>Of the latter, though not le&s;s known with re&s;pect to its <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI> I &s;hall refre&s;h your me|mory with a few of the mo&s;t important <HI>parti|culars,</HI> becau&s;e they may be nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;|trate &s;ome of tho&s;e cau&s;es of the famous revo|lution which was attempted at this time, and who&s;e grand object was to &s;ubvert every prin|ciple on which the union had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, with a view <Q>to dimini&s;h, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the power of the States General, to attach the privileges of the Stadtholder, to a&s;&s;ert, on all occa&s;ions, the independence of the States of Holland, and to di&s;regard the op|po&s;ition of &s;uch Members of the Union as they &s;hould be unable to draw over to their intere&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>In One Thou&s;and Five Hundred and Seventy|nine, the Seven Provinces, harra&s;&s;ed, galled,
<PB N="313" REF="332">and worn out with perpetual tyrannies, put an end to the deliberations of this far-famed treaty, which contained the fundamental laws of the Republic, and may be con&s;idered as the origin of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>By one of the articles it was &s;tipulated, that no truce &s;hall be accorded, no peace made, no war entered upon, nor any tax, or impo&s;t of any kind levied, without the unanimous con|&s;ent of the Provinces.</P>
<P>By another, that no Province, or City &s;hall be empowered to enter into any confederation, nor form any alliance with the neighbour|ing nations, or their &s;overeigns, without the like univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent of all the States of the Republic.</P>
<P>They were, moreover, to aid, and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in all ca&s;es again&s;t a foreign invader or enemy; they were to be allowed the freedom of a difference in their religious ceremonies, conformably to the pacification of Gand; equal admini&s;tration of impartial ju&s;tice to &s;trangers, as to natives of the country; to pay equal taxes according to the powers of each Province
<PB N="314" REF="333">at that time &s;ettled, on fair equipoi&s;e of divi|&s;ion, and not to alter any of the articles of the &s;aid creaty without the &s;olemn concurrence of <HI>all</HI> the States a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The friends to the Hou&s;e of Orange con&s;i|der the treaty, out of which I have taken the&s;e prominent features, as the &s;acred portrait of the public wealth and happine&s;s: as that ble&s;&s;ed heptarchy, which, &s;o far from degenerating into anarchy, orders and &s;trengthens the links in the well-compacted chain of the Republic.</P>
<P>The Dutch patriots, neverthele&s;s, frequently di&s;&s;atisfied, at la&s;t projected, and had very nearly carried into execution, their <HI>favourite</HI> alterations&mdash;the mo&s;t important of which were "That the <HI>forms</HI> of the pre&s;ent Government &s;hould continue to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but that the States &s;hould become, in every re&s;pect, completely independent of the Stadtholder, and that for this purpo&s;e, he &s;hould no longer enjoy a &s;eat in any of the colleges of the Republic. That the <HI>Reglemens</HI> &s;hould be aboli&s;hed. That the Stadtholder's right of recommending candi|dates for the vacant magi&s;tracies in the towns of Holland, &s;hould cea&s;e. That the charges of the Stadtholder, and Captain-General, &s;hould,
<PB N="315" REF="334">if po&s;&s;ible, be &s;eparated, and conferred on dif|ferent per&s;ons; or that, at lea&s;t, the titles only &s;hould be re&s;erved to the Prince of Orange; and the offices be executed as in the time of the De Witts, by Deputies cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e. In general, that the Stadtholder &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch powers <HI>only</HI> as might enable him to execute the <HI>orders of the State</HI>&mdash;a &s;ort of upper &s;ervant of the Republic! That the hereditary Stadt|holderate &s;hould continue in the Prince of Orange, <HI>on his acceptance of the&s;e terms,</HI> but that, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al, the different States &s;hould be at liberty to elect another Stadt|holder.</P>
<P>Of what this plan was productive at the time it was formed, and what it mediated yet more recently we &s;hall &s;ee in their places.</P>
<P>Ah my friend, how difficult it is to pre&s;cribe proper bounds to freedom! or rather, how ea&s;y it is to pre&s;cribe, and how difficult to follow the rules, where men are determined to exact more, or &s;ubmit to le&s;s, than their na|tural rights. Rea&s;on, religion, and ju&s;tice, ought certainly to be the active agents of all human government&mdash;"their ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all their paths are peace;"
<PB N="316" REF="335">nor does any thing more &s;eem requi&s;ite to ob|tain all the ble&s;&s;ings of their gentle and bene|volent &s;way than to draw the true line of di&s;|tinction betwixt liberty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. It would be well for all per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to cavil with their Governors, or with Government, to con&s;ider what an able politician has &s;ubmit|ted to their con&s;ideration. <Q>As war, (&s;ays he) is one of the heavie&s;t of evils, a calamity which involves every &s;pecies of mi&s;ery; as it &s;ets the general &s;afety to hazard; as it &s;u&s;|pends commerce, and de&s;olates the country; as it expo&s;es great numbers to hard&s;hips, cap|tivity, and death; no man, who de&s;ires pub|lic pro&s;perity, will inflame general re&s;entment by aggravating minute injuries, or enforcing di&s;putable rights of little importance;</Q> and with re&s;pect to <HI>Liberty,</HI> it is not, as my learned and excellent friend, Mr. Potter, ob&s;erves, <Q>a &s;ickly exotic, rai&s;ed in a foreign hotbed of &s;edition, and watered with human blood; but like our oak, a native of our i&s;land, rooted in its &s;oil, rai&s;ed to its magnificent growth by the genial air of the climate, and pre&s;erved in everla&s;ting vigour by our free con&s;titu|tion.</Q> Nor can I, in this place, refu&s;e to join the virtuous &s;entiments of the great and good man from whom I have gleaned this beau|tiful
<PB N="317" REF="336">image; and mo&s;t heartily rejoice with him that the public &s;pirit is now rou&s;ed, not only to defend the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings at home, but to re|&s;tore them abroad. The public faith is now engaged to protect, not only our allies, but our enemies (even tho&s;e who bear us an almo&s;t hereditary hate) again&s;t the in&s;idious artifices, and ho&s;tile attacks of atheti&s;tical, ferocious, and &s;anguinary ruffians, who have violated every law human and divine, and declared war again&s;t all mankind:
<Q>"Havock, and &s;poil, and ruin are their gain."</Q> But happily the "&s;cientific principle," which hath been held out as the "polar &s;tar," by which the ve&s;&s;el of the State was to be guided in a bolder navigation, to di&s;cover, in unexplored regions, the trea&s;ures of public felicity, is found to be a meteor who&s;e baleful glare has led the&s;e wretched pilots to da&s;h it again&s;t a rock in a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea, where it mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h, without God him&s;elf delivers it from the danger&mdash;the God of armies, who&s;e red right arm this unhappy people &s;eem particu|larly to have called forth. What other atro|cious deeds are de&s;tined to fill up the mea&s;ure of their guilt, we mu&s;t leave to that Almighty Power, who, as in the dreadful example be|fore
<PB N="318" REF="337">us, "ari&s;eth to &s;hake terribly the earth;" and whether it is by pe&s;tilence, by earthquakes, by &s;torm and tempe&s;t, or by the &s;word and fiercene&s;s of man, we mu&s;t adopt the creed of this degraded nation, ere we can cea&s;e to be|lieve all the&s;e are delegated by an offended God: but how far the commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy extends, we cannot know. The French ap|pear almo&s;t to have exhau&s;ted the wide and capacious powers of human invention to do evil.</P>
<P>But all this is anticipation. How have I been led into it? Again&s;t my own purpo&s;ed intent too&mdash;of re&s;erving what I have to offer on the&s;e &s;ubjects to a more convenient &s;ea&s;on, af|ter I have done with themes of peace. It is, indeed, difficult to do this in the mid&s;t of con|tinual alarms, which threaten not only the in|fatuated people to whom the&s;e ob&s;ervations are more immediately applicable, but every other government, and all tho&s;e well-ordered e&s;ta|bli&s;hments among&s;t men, which the wi&s;dom, labour, and patrioti&s;m of ages have in&s;tituted. Return with me to the Province of Utrecht; there, at the tombs of the learned and wi&s;e, the great and good, let us get knowledge and un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="338">The town of Utrecht, you know, was either the birth or burial place of many illu&s;trious men, particularly the two Burmans, Graevius and Graenovius; of all whom &s;trangers are here &s;hewn the &s;eats, where "nobly pen&s;ive they &s;at and thought;" the places where they lived, and where they now &s;leep the &s;leep of death. Graevius, of whom the real name was Graew, taught politicks, eloquence, and hi&s;tory, in this univer&s;ity upwards of forty years. His great work (the "Trea&s;ures of Ancient Rome, its Antiquities, &amp;c.") is an immen&s;e collection of different pieces upon the laws, cu&s;toms, and manners of the Romans, in thirteen volumes folio, and written in conjunction with Grae|novius, Profe&s;&s;or of Belles Lettres and Geo|graphy. Of the&s;e great men, as well as of their friend and &s;cholar Peter Burman, our Literary Atlas, Samuel John&s;on, has &s;poken in high terms. One of the qualities, &s;ays the Doctor, which contributed eminently to qua|lify Graevius for an in&s;tructor of youth was the &s;agacity by which he readily di&s;covered the predominant faculty of each pupil, and the pe|culiar de&s;ignation by which nature had allotted him to any &s;pecies of literature, and by which he was &s;oon able to determine that Peter Bur|man was remarkably adapted to cla&s;&s;ical &s;tu|dies,
<PB N="320" REF="339">and to predict the great advances he would make by indu&s;triou&s;ly pur&s;uing the direction of his genius. On the other hand, animated by the encouragement of a tutor, &s;o celebrated as Graevius, Peter Burman, by continuing the vigour of his application, fulfilled his ma&s;ter's prophecy; and it has been a&s;&s;erted that he had pa&s;&s;ed honourably and fairly through the cla&s;&s;es, and was admitted into the univer&s;ity, at the age of thirteen. His biographer allows this to be &s;o &s;tupendous a progre&s;s as to &s;urpa&s;s the li|mits of all probability; of which, indeed, every man mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, who con&s;iders that it is not uncommon for the highe&s;t genius in our country to be entangled for ten years in tho&s;e thorny paths of literature which Burman is repre&s;ented to have pa&s;&s;ed in le&s;s than two. But this prodigy has been cleared up very &s;a|tisfactorily by the following ob&s;ervation. In the univer&s;ities of foreign countries, they have profe&s;&s;ors of philology or humanity, who&s;e employment is to in&s;truct the younger cla&s;&s;es in grammar, rhetoric, and languages; nor do they engage in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, till they have pa&s;&s;ed through a cour&s;e of philo|logical lectures and exerci&s;es, to which, in &s;ome places, two years are commonly allotted. Whereas the Engli&s;h &s;cheme of education,
<PB N="321" REF="340">which, with regard to academical &s;tudies, is more vigorous, and &s;ets literary honours at a higher price than that of any other country, exacts from the youth, who are initiated in our colleges, a degree of philological knowledge, &s;ufficient to qualify them for lectures in phi|lo&s;ophy, which are read to them in Latin, and to enable them to proceed in other &s;tudies without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that it may be conjec|tured that Burman, at his entrance into the univer&s;ity of Leyden, had no &s;uch &s;kill in languages, nor &s;uch ability of compo&s;ition as are frequently to be met with in the higher cla&s;&s;es of an Engli&s;h &s;chool; nor was, perhaps, at that time, more than moderately &s;killed in Latin, and taught the fir&s;t rudiments of Greek.</P>
<P>The next object is Friezeland, which has always maintained a kind of rival&s;hip with the province la&s;t con&s;idered. It is a &s;eigneurie, containing a circuit of five-and-forty leagues. The inhabitants have been, at all times, war|like and jealous of their liberties. Originally they had a Roman education, which may ac|count for this ardent <HI>amor patriae,</HI> having &s;erved under the emperors Tiberius and Nero, both
<PB N="322" REF="341">of whom looked on them as the be&s;t and brave&s;t &s;oldiers of Germany.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that their early hi&s;tory, like that of mo&s;t other nations, is involved in fables; and they trace their princes in pretended and pompous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from the time of Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>Their name is derived from their fir&s;t prince, Fri&s;on, who came from A&s;ia three hundred and thirty years before the birth of our Saviour.</P>
<P>This province was afterwards erected into a monarchy, and then under the &s;way of go|vernors. It afterwards came, by right of con|que&s;t, to a brother of a Prince of Orange; and two years after the famous pacification of Ghent, in 1572, it was annexed, by a kind of union re&s;embling that of England and Scot|land, to the States of Holland. The fir&s;t Stadtholder of this province was a brother of William, the celebrated founder of the Re|public.</P>
<P>Friezeland is out of the beaten and popular track of travellers, although there is not any of the &s;even provinces, my friend, which has
<PB N="323" REF="342">more claim to their curio&s;ity. An Engli&s;hman in particular will here find him&s;elf at home. The face of the country, the general manners of the people, their modes of living, and their very language a&s;&s;imilates to Great Britain.</P>
<P>The meadow grounds, and pretty inclo&s;ures, perpetually remind an Engli&s;h traveller of his native grounds; and the arable land is &s;o fa|vourable to the gifts of Ceres, that what, in the&s;e iron days, &s;eems a poetical figure, is a li|teral truth in Friezeland,
<Q>"Where ev'ry rood of ground maintains his man."</Q> The &s;oil is &s;o grateful to the labour of the hu&s;|bandman, that it returns his corn, e&s;pecially his wheat an hundred fold; and it is not more re|markable for quantity than quality. The oats are al&s;o admirable; to which may, perhaps, be imputed the peculiar growth and &s;trength of the hor&s;es that are bred and nouri&s;hed here.</P>
<P>I was gleaning this province, when warlike preparations were making for the pre&s;ent di&s;|pute, betwixt France and the re&s;t of the uni|ver&s;e; and an order of the States for five hun|dred hor&s;e was executed, to the &s;atisfaction of
<PB N="324" REF="343">the Commi&s;&s;ioner, in eight-and-forty hours. The Friezelanders live in the mo&s;t perfect good fellow&s;hip with each other, and having good hou&s;es, good hor&s;es, good property, and good|nature, are at once healthy, happy, and &s;ocial; and what in a province of Holland, or, now|a-days in any country, is not le&s;s remarkable, they are wholly exempt from tythes.</P>
<P>When you vi&s;it this province, let me direct your &s;teps to <HI>Staverin,</HI> the mo&s;t ancient town of Friezeland, and &s;aid to be built a year after the birth of Chri&s;t. It is indebted for its name to the idol Stavon, and is very curiou&s;ly &s;itu|ated upon a point of the gulph of the Zuyder|&s;ea, oppo&s;ite to Holland. Innumerable &s;and|banks inve&s;t the coa&s;t, ina&s;much, that when the &s;ea is at ebb, many of them are vi&s;ible; e&s;|pecially one, concerning which there is an anecdote, that I &s;hall commit to your credu|lity. This bank is called <HI>l'Vrouwenland</HI> (wi|dow's land) becau&s;e the &s;uper&s;tition goes that a rich widow threw into this place a great quan|tity of corn, which &s;he had avariciou&s;ly fore|&s;talled, and heaped up in a time of general &s;carcity, and which &s;he wanted the genero&s;ity to give, or even the ju&s;tice to &s;ell to her &s;tarving neighbours. Now, although the grain
<PB N="325" REF="344">thus &s;quandered away was de&s;troyed, it was not, it &s;eems, &s;uffered to be di&s;&s;ipated, even by the devouring waves; but was ordered by the power, who "rules old Ocean, and directs the &s;torm," to remain a monument of his wrath, and embarra&s;s the haven, where this guilty ac|tion was committed; &s;erving, at the &s;ame time, as a le&s;&s;on to the hard-hearted!</P>
<P>About three miles from Staveren is Mol|quern, where they &s;peak a jargon &s;carce intel|ligible to the mo&s;texpert lingui&s;ts of Friezeland, and where the hou&s;es are &s;eparated from each other in a manner &s;o truly whim&s;ical, that a &s;tranger finds him&s;elf more in want of a clue, than if he were threading the mazes of Ro&s;amond's bower. On your entrance into the town, you will be vi&s;ited by a guide, who will conduct you through the windings of this meandering town. The dre&s;s of the people, and the architecture of the place, leads one to &s;uppo&s;e they are of Saxon origin.</P>
<P>The province of Over-y&s;&s;el, follows, in order, that of Friezeland. There is a tradition that the Salique law was fir&s;t in&s;tituted in that part of Over-y&s;&s;el called Zallant,&mdash;agreeable to which preten&s;ion, one of the mo&s;t important
<PB N="326" REF="345">articles of that law, re&s;pecting fiefs and land|tenures, is &s;till &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that e&s;tates of the above de&s;cription are always en|tailed upon heirs male, to the exclu&s;ion of females.</P>
<P>I cannot recommend to you many things in this province, either curious or beautiful; but if you pay it a pa&s;&s;ing vi&s;it, you will not fail to make the town of Zwol among&s;t your ex|cur&s;ions, becau&s;e near it the virtuous Thomas &agrave; Kempis lived and died. I was a&s;&s;ured that he there wrote his ju&s;tly valued Imitation of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1718, was con|ducted into Zwol a wild girl, who was found in the woods of Cranenbourg. She was about eighteen years of age, and, except a tru&s;s of &s;traw round her wai&s;t, was entirely naked. She &s;poke a jargon, which neither the learned men of the province, nor the pea&s;ants under&s;tood. Her nouri&s;hment, even after civilization, was herbs, roots, and leaves of trees. She was di&s;covered by the country people many months before &s;he was caught, as &s;he ran with incre|dible &s;peed, and took refuge, in the rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t, the moment &s;he was pur&s;ued, and was
<PB N="327" REF="346">at la&s;t taken only by &s;tratagem. Nets and traps were laid and &s;et for her, and in one of the&s;e &s;he was entangled. When caught, &s;he manife&s;ted a gentle and docile di&s;po&s;ition, and recommended her&s;elf &s;o much to the per&s;ons who had her in charge, that the magi&s;trates of Zwol became intere&s;ted for her; and in the hope of throwing &s;ome light on her hi&s;tory, adverti&s;ed her &s;hape, features, &amp;c. with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that it came out a widow woman of Antwerp had lo&s;t her only child, a daughter, who&s;e per&s;on and age an&s;wered to that of the wild girl of the woods. Struck with the &s;imi|litude, the widow ha&s;tened to Zwol, and at the fir&s;t glance recognized her offspring, who te&s;|tified, on her part, no le&s;s natural affection to|wards her mother, to who&s;e protection &s;he was delivered, and with whom &s;he pa&s;&s;ed many years in filial piety, the wonder and pity of innumerable witne&s;&s;es to her &s;ingular fate, and as &s;ingular good qualities&mdash;the growth only of &s;imple nature.</P>
<P>The Seigneurie of Groninguen was anciently a part of Friezeland, from which it is now di|vided, both with re&s;pect to government and laws. Con&s;idered as a &s;eparate province, it is of no great extent, comprehending in its terri|tory
<PB N="328" REF="347">only the land lying between the rivers Een and Lawer. This is &s;ufficiently fertile, and the chief town, which gives a name to the whole county, is rich, large, and flouri&s;hing; in which de&s;cription, indeed, may be com|pri&s;ed the general character of the towns of Friezeland, to which may very truly be added, the beauty of the women, it being difficult to meet a Friezelander female, who has not &s;ome claim to admiration on the &s;core of her per|&s;onal attractions, which perhaps derive &s;ome advantages from a picture&s;que manner of head|dre&s;s, calculated to give an effect to an inno|cent and delicate countenance.</P>
<P>We come now to a very di&s;tingui&s;hed part of the United States&mdash;namely, the beautiful and valuable province of Guelderland.</P>
<P>Geographers in&s;i&s;t that this is the country formerly inhabited by the people whom Julius Cae&s;ar, in his Commentaries, has mentioned, under the names of the Merapii, U&s;ipetes, Gugerni, and Sicambri. Be&s;ides the county of Zutphen, Guelderland con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-two con&s;iderable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wns, and more than three hun|dred villages. It has already been under the
<PB N="329" REF="348">government of Signiors, Counts, Dukes, and Chancellors.</P>
<P>In point of air, water, and elevation of country, it lifts it&s;elf pre-eminently above any of the United Provinces; and a traveller, after re&s;iding at the re&s;t, will regale him&s;elf in Guelderland, and gratulate him&s;elf on the ex|change. I have trod and re-trod, at different times, every part of it with plea&s;ure, and am again preparing to pay it a vi&s;it; the particu|lars of which &s;hall be in due place imparted to you.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Guelderland is connected with the county of Zuphen, as dependencies of the States General. Although, as I have before ob&s;erved, the province of Holland is the mo&s;t powerful, that of Guelderland is con&s;idered as de&s;erving to take the lead, as to elegance, health, and fertility, or rather imagery of coun|try. The capital towns are Arnheim and Nimeguen, of both which my promi&s;ed future accounts will include a de&s;cription.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the weather relents, the world of ice yields to a genial thaw that has been gently
<PB N="330" REF="349">unbinding the fro&s;t for &s;ome days; the &s;luices once more open a pa&s;&s;age for the Trech&s;cuyts, in one of which I &s;hall to-morrow morning &s;et off for Leyden, but not before I have ex|pre&s;&s;ed my hopes, that my &s;tay at Rotterdam has been productive of &s;ome amu&s;ement and information. The po&s;t awaits my pacquet, and I mu&s;t &s;ay adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Leyden.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER being &s;o long weather-bound in a town, I found a trip by water quite a re|lief, which was, perhaps, not a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the companions of my voyage; for the &s;chuyt was fertile of characters, among&s;t which was a Dutch lady, who, having at lea&s;t twice doubled the matrimonial Cape of Good Hope, and ju&s;t e&s;caped the rocks of de&s;perate virgi|nity, was going to be&s;tow her hand on a per|&s;on who &s;till thought either it, or the weight of <HI>gelt</HI> (money) it brought, an object of e&s;|pou&s;al. She re&s;ided at a village in the way to Leyden, and had been at Rotterdam to pur|cha&s;e finery for her bridals. The company were &s;oon amu&s;ed with a &s;ight of the articles, which &s;he di&s;played with an o&s;tentation that &s;hewed her vanity both as to property and per|&s;on; and it is often lucky for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, that vanity, like love, is blind, otherwi&s;e this good lady would have &s;een, that neither her per&s;on or property were ju&s;t objects of critical ob&s;erva|tion;
<PB N="332" REF="351">the one being coar&s;e, and the other paltry. It would have highly delighted you, who have a correct ta&s;te, to have been an eye|witne&s;s of this &s;plendid vulgarity. The im|men&s;e bracelets, the ponderous ear-rings, the &s;even-fold necklaces, be&s;tudded with huge &s;hining &s;tones of many colours, indeed of <HI>all</HI> hues but the gentle, mode&s;t, and retiring ones. But far above the re&s;t, "&s;uperior land alone," on a head made into a thick pa&s;te, with pow|der and pomatum, &s;hone forth a ma&s;&s;y hair|pin, of ro&s;e diamonds, which, in&s;tead of being airily fa&s;tened, &s;eemed nailed to her fore|head, on each &s;ide of which &s;tuck a couple of new coquet-temple-patches, "round as a &s;hield," of the &s;ize of an Engli&s;h half-crown, and &s;preading to the very eye-brow.</P>
<P>When you have &s;ufficiently admired the&s;e, I will call your attention to four tawdry rings, ornamenting four ugly brown fingers, which the amiable owner of them di&s;played as if they had been &s;haped by the godde&s;s of &s;ymmetry. It is not ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee a wer&s;e a&s;&s;orted &s;uite of decorations upon a more inelegant form; and &s;till more difficult would it be for any body to have a better opinion of either that form, or of tho&s;e decorations, than the fair ob|ject
<PB N="333" REF="352">to whom they belonged. How fortu|nately it is ordered, that our very awkwardne&s;&s;es are thus converted into objects of happine&s;s, by our &s;elf-love, and that nothing more &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the felicity of the inelegant, than that (whatever may be another's idea of their ta&s;te or attractions) they &s;hould be upon the be&s;t terms with them&s;elves. Hence what you may contemn as vulgar, and regret as unfit for the fa&s;hion of the hour, is appreciated by con|ceit, and thought to be both beautiful and becoming. A well-bred per&s;on, on the con|trary, is, for the &s;ake of his a&s;&s;ociates, often obliged to &s;acrifice even his vanity; at lea&s;t his vanity depends more on others than on him&s;elf, and cannot be gratified without the approbation of the refined part of the world; concerning which hone&s;t ill bred vulgarity is altogether carele&s;s, unle&s;s the applau&s;es of the world happen to concur with the e&s;timate it forms of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our Dutch virgin, however, in her own adornment, did not forget to accommodate her intended bridegroom, who&s;e ta&s;te, &s;he a&s;&s;ured us, &s;he had con&s;ulted no le&s;s than her own (a lucky &s;imilarity you will &s;ay) in the choice of her decorations. But to demon&s;trate in a
<PB N="334" REF="353">more particular manner, her loving kindne&s;s towards him, &s;he now &s;hewed her fellow-pa&s;|&s;engers a curious tobacco-pipe, of the fine&s;t porcelain, on which was bepainted, in glaring colours, a dowdy Venus, and a &s;quabby pair of Cupids, the one taking &s;nuff, and the others &s;ending their whiffs at one another. Of this in&s;trument the &s;topper was &s;ilver, and the chain, to which it was attached, of the &s;ame metal: and that the gift might be complete, our ancient maiden had bought a china &s;pit|ting ba&s;on, on which al&s;o was depicted certain emblems of her delicate pa&s;&s;ion. How few of our Engli&s;h maidens would have thus admi|ni&s;tered to the accompli&s;hments of their lovers. A tobacco-pipe and &s;pitting-box as a nuptial gift! Profit, ye votaries of the belle pa&s;&s;ion, by the example.</P>
<P>A droll fellow, who &s;at on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, malignly a&s;&s;ured me, that about a twelvemonth ago, he had, under the favour of Providence, got rid of the halter with which the fair Hol|lander was about to hang her&s;elf. All this time, two Dutchmen, who embraced each other at their fir&s;t entrance into the boat, and, in token of good fellow&s;hip, lighted their pipes by joining the bowls, and whiffing at each
<PB N="335" REF="354">other, &s;et in for &s;erious &s;moking, while two elderly women regaled their no&s;trils with a no le&s;s &s;olid and &s;olemn &s;nuffing match. I do not believe a dozen words were &s;poken among&s;t the four during the whole voyage.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw the&s;e mutes into conver&s;ation, I tried them on every &s;ub|ject I thought mo&s;t likely to lead them into di&s;cour&s;e; but, as if it were a pre-determined thing neither to &s;peak to each other, nor any body el&s;e, all I &s;aid to the two &s;mokers only produced a more than ordinary whiff in my face; and in return for my courte&s;y to the fe|males, I received only the effluvia of a fre&s;h pinch of &s;nuff, which &s;et me a &s;neezing. I was therefore glad to let them take their own way, and indeed found their mute &s;tate more &s;upportable than their conver&s;ation and its ac|companiments. We reached Leyden at the &s;tated hour, and took different ways, perhaps, mutually di&s;&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting this town, it is &s;o much among&s;t the common objects of de&s;cription, that I &s;hall refer you to any one of the many books which have treated of it for the <HI>brick and mortar par|ticulars,</HI> as I &s;hall tho&s;e of the &s;till greater city
<PB N="336" REF="355">of Am&s;terdam. The literary and itinerant &s;hewmen of our own country have, however, left behind them rather carele&s;sly &s;ome things which the foreign travellers have <HI>gleaned,</HI> and which, deeming them worth the pains, I &s;hall borrow for our &s;heaf. My rule has all along been to pre&s;ent you with as much of my own wheat as I could gather; but whenever I have been able to enrich my little harve&s;t-home, by a few good grains, I have made no &s;cruple of tran&s;porting them to my native &s;oil.</P>
<P>Leyden, which is certainly a very elegant city, (and, I think, a &s;triking re&s;emblance of Oxford, but wanting its life and motion) has been rendered famous in hi&s;tory by the courage of its citizens, who, in 1574, &s;u&s;tained a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate&s;iege, attended with all the evils of war, famine, and di&s;ea&s;e, and purely to pre&s;erve their liberties. It is a&s;toni&s;hing none of the Briti&s;h travellers have given their countrymen the detail of this memorable tran&s;action. Had it happened in their own country, or in any other but Holland, which has, as I have fre|quently ob&s;erved, been very unju&s;tly &s;lighted, an hundred biographers would have embla|zoned every day's prowe&s;s during the five months that the &s;iege continued.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="356">The Spaniards having been obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Alcmaer, turned their arms again&s;t Leyden, from whence they were driven by Count Louis, of Na&s;&s;au, brother to the then Prince of Orange. Some time afterwards, however, they returned, under a &s;trong reinforcement, to the attack. The Spani&s;h general (Francis Valdey) finding it impo&s;&s;ible to take the town by force, re&s;olved to attempt the more power|ful means of famine. No pen can de&s;cribe what the citizens &s;uffered from this blockade. Reduced to the mo&s;t dreadful extremity, they retained their heroi&s;m, even when there was &s;carce any thing left to &s;u&s;tain it. They drew lots for each other, which &s;hould become the victim of the day, to give &s;u&s;tenance to the re&s;t; and many thinking it a more glorious act of patrioti&s;m, voluntarily offered them&s;elves up, and &s;upplicated for the preference of death, to nouri&s;h with their bodies their fellow-&s;ol|diers or citizens. Even the women, as well tho&s;e of di&s;tinction as others, mounted the ramparts, fired the cannon, and expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to all the dangers and drudgery of mi|litary life, in imitation of a &s;econd Boadicea, named Kennava, who led them on. The be&s;iegers were &s;truck with the regular, not rio|tous, intrepidity of this troop of female war|riors.
<PB N="338" REF="357">Even they too, as if jealous of the bra|very of the men, petitioned that they might be accepted as &s;acrifices to feed the now almo&s;t fami&s;hed garri&s;on and citizens, many thou&s;ands of whom peri&s;hed for want, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;upplies of human fle&s;h. The Spaniards having learned their &s;ituation, once more &s;um|moned them to &s;urrender, and granted them the truce of an hour to con&s;ider of it. They employed this &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities to gather the general &s;en&s;e of the people, as well &s;oldiers as inhabitants, and this was their reply. "Tell your haughty general, we can never be &s;aid to want the means of life, or of continu|ing the &s;iege; while a <HI>left arm</HI> remains upon any of our &s;houlders: our <HI>right</HI> we &s;hall re&s;erve to fight for our liberties."</P>
<P>To the dire nece&s;&s;ity of living upon each other, they had, indeed, been long reduced; and the moment after the herald had departed, four of the burghers, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation with each other, pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the gar|ri&s;on; and after fighting vigorou&s;ly, on the ramparts, for &s;everal hours, turned their bay|onets upon them&s;elves, and piercing their own bo&s;oms, exclaimed, as the life-blood
<PB N="339" REF="358">flowed from them&mdash;"Behold, my valiant friends, your provi&s;ion for the re&s;t of the day."</P>
<P>The famine, however, hourly increa&s;ing, &s;ome of the burghers voted for a &s;urrender of the place. It was on this occa&s;ion that Adrian Van Werf, the chief magi&s;trate of the city, &s;et an example of con&s;tancy and courage, which would have merited a fir&s;t place in the records of human magnanimity, had it not been for the above-mentioned heroi&s;m of the four citizens. &mdash;"My friends," cried he, <Q>I deem it infi|nitely more &s;atisfying to die for you, than for the enemy. Let me then be your next victim. Cut this body in pieces, and in &s;haring it among&s;t you, remember it is to give you &s;trength to continue the &s;iege:&mdash;the many wounds I have received make me no longer able to take an active part. Let me not become wa&s;te by lingering in tho&s;e wounds. While I can yet be of &s;ervice, take me to your&s;elves, and may Leyden be victorious and immortal.</Q> Amid&s;t the&s;e &s;ore di&s;a&s;ters of battle, the news of their &s;peedy relief was brought by &s;ome pigeons, to who&s;e feet were tied &s;talks of corn and hemp, in the tubes of which were letters. I mu&s;t not omit to tell
<PB N="340" REF="359">you, that the&s;e pigeons are &s;till pre&s;erved, em|balmed, and to be &s;een in the town-hou&s;e."</P>
<P>On the 3d of October, the banks of the Meu&s;e, and the Y&s;&s;el, being cut, Louis Bri&s;&s;ot, Admiral of Zealand, poured in to the relief of the be&s;ieged a great number of flat-bottomed boats, armed from helm to &s;tern. The Spa|niards, panic-&s;truck by this unexpected rein|forcement, abandoned their works, and made the be&s;t of their way into their own frontiers.</P>
<P>The anniver&s;ary of this memorable day is &s;till celebrated at Leyden. The clergy are obliged to recapitulate the &s;tory of the &s;iege, and the almo&s;t miracle of the deliverance of the town. It is, perhaps, to be wi&s;hed, that the memory of &s;imilar events were revived by &s;imilar ceremonies, &s;ince every epoch, which commemorates the well-directed fortitude of men, or the interpo&s;ition of Providence, can|not be too exten&s;ively known: in which, in|deed, both religion and policy are alike con|cerned. We faithfully keep alive the darke&s;t tran&s;actions&mdash;&s;uch as the gunpowder plot, the revocation of the edict of Nantes, the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew, and various other inci|dents that &s;tain the annals of hi&s;tory, and
<PB N="341" REF="360">which it is for the credit of human nature to obliviate, while we neglect tho&s;e happy events, and ble&s;&s;ed &s;udden revolutions, which manife&s;t a divine power, a&s;&s;i&s;ting mortal endeavours. Methinks, &s;uch memorials are calculated to in&s;pire a noble emulation in the citizens to imitate their ance&s;tors: for virtue, like vice, is certainly epidemic. William, Prince of Orange, although, at the time, labouring under a dangerous malady, ordered him&s;elf to be carried, in a litter, to Leyden, to return thanks, in per&s;on, to the citizens, for their generous a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. By way of recompence, he granted to the town many privileges and immunities, and laid, with his own hand, the foundation of its celebrated univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>This famous &s;eminary may properly be &s;aid to be erected by Gratitude, and dedicated to the courage and intrepidity of the &s;ons of freedom. Many truly valuable members of &s;ociety have been &s;ent into the world from hence. Among&s;t others, the celebrated Her|man Boerhaave, of whom I made honourable mention in a former letter. His reputation, as a phy&s;ician, was &s;o great, that a letter &s;ent to him from Turkey, in A&s;ia, was addre&s;&s;ed to Dr. Boerhaave in Europe; his family have
<PB N="342" REF="361">lately erected a monument, which I ye&s;terday vi&s;ited. It is in the &s;pacious and beautiful church of St. Peter, where he was buried. The monument it&s;elf is a &s;imple pede&s;tal of black marble, on the &s;urface of which is engraved, immediately under a bu&s;t of the Doctor, the&s;e words: <HI>"Simplex &s;igillum veri."</HI> On the re|ver&s;e &s;ide is this emphatic expre&s;&s;ion: <HI>"Salu|tifero Boerhavii genio &s;acrum."</HI></P>
<P>Leyden has to boa&s;t al&s;o the birth of Rem|brant, with who&s;e life, as an arti&s;t, we are &s;uf|ficiently acquainted by hi&s;tory: but I do not remember to have &s;een the following anecdotes of his private life and character. His ava|rice (rarely the vice of genius) was &s;o exce&s;|&s;ive, that it led him frequently to fell his own paintings, in an underhand manner, &s;everal times over: nay, he &s;ometimes made his own &s;on di&s;po&s;e of them, and by way of ex|cu&s;ing his deception, when found out, pretend|ed his &s;on had &s;tolen them.</P>
<P>It is reported of this painter, that, being one day employed upon a family piece, in which every individual was to be exhibited, news be|ing brought to him that his favourite monkey was dead, he in&s;i&s;ted upon the animal being
<PB N="343" REF="362">immediately laid before him, and drew him as a principal figure of the groupe: refu&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, to expunge the monkey, al|though he lo&s;t the &s;ale of the picture, and al|though he loved money better than any thing but the monkey and his own caprices. That money was in the next degree precious to him, may likewi&s;e be evinced from a trick that was played on him by one of his &s;cholars, who, knowing the di&s;po&s;ition of his ma&s;ter, painted an apparently large &s;um of money, in different coins, upon a pack of cards, cut into &s;uitable pieces. The&s;e the di&s;ciple di&s;tributed on the painter's table, when Rembrant was from home. On his return, he no &s;ooner &s;aw the counterfeits, than &s;uppo&s;ing it the price of &s;ome pictures &s;old in his ab&s;ence, he ran to pick it up, and when he found him&s;elf di&s;appointed, forgave the &s;tratagem for the &s;ake of the ingenuity of the imitation: for though he loved gold immoderately, he could not but be attached to genius.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary per&s;onage, which the town of Leyden has produced, is the cele|brated fanatic, commonly called John of Ley|den, the true name of whom is <HI>Bucold,</HI> who&s;e &s;to|ry is really curious. From the lowe&s;t extraction
<PB N="344" REF="363">he a&s;pired to the highe&s;t honours; and though born of the humble&s;t parents, and intended, by his father, for a taylor, gave out very early among&s;t his young companions, that &s;o far from &s;ucceeding to his father's contemptible occupa|tion, he was re&s;olved to live, and die, a king. Let us &s;ee in what manner he contrived to keep his word. He &s;oon broke from the &s;hop|board, uncro&s;&s;ed his legs, and, a&s;&s;ociating with &s;ome itinerant comedians, commenced actor, and, determined on royalty, made his fir&s;t ap|pearance in a princely character. His next connection was with a man as lowly born, and as highly minded as him&s;elf, namely with a baker of Am&s;terdam, who declared that he was an amba&s;&s;ador of God, to enlighten the dark|ne&s;s of his fellow-creatures, and erect a new Jeru&s;alem. This daring &s;pirit a&s;&s;umed the name of the town in which he received his birth, <HI>viz.</HI> Thomas Mun&s;ter, who had infected a great number of Germans with his contagi|ous doctrines, in oppo&s;ition to the efforts of Luther, previous to his acquaintance with John of Leyden; and as religious &s;editions are always the mo&s;t violent, it was, at length, found nece&s;&s;ary to take up arms again&s;t this fanatic faction, every hour gaining &s;trength. Of all epidemics, that of a wild, but new
<PB N="345" REF="364">&s;ectary, is the mo&s;t rapid and fatal. The Elec|tor of Saxony, the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and the Duke of Brun&s;wick, entered into a con|federacy, to quell the&s;e in&s;urgents, whom they often routed, but whom they found a great difficulty wholly to &s;ubdue. Mun&s;ter was him|&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, and in&s;tantly beheaded. But this tragic event, &s;o far from di&s;piriting the party, appeared only to animate it with a more inveterate zeal and oppo&s;ition. John of Leyden, commanding a troop of ferocious zea|lots, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the town of Mun&s;ter; where, after he had exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t horrible cruelties, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be cho&s;en and proclaimed King.</P>
<P>His prediction, as to mock-maje&s;ty, was now fulfilled; but not the mea&s;ure, either of his ambition or his crimes. No &s;ooner had he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in his new government, than he i&s;&s;ued edicts, and enacted laws. He permit|ted polygamy, and &s;et the example, by taking unto him&s;elf twenty wives. Some authors limit the number to fourteen. He pulled down all the churches, and totally changed the admini&s;tration. He next in&s;tituted a re|gular court, and in&s;i&s;ted on receiving all the homage of royalty. A faithful hi&s;torian of
<PB N="346" REF="365">his times, a&s;&s;ures us, that he had all the abilities e&s;&s;ential to wife and ju&s;t legi&s;lation; but that his headlong pa&s;&s;ions, and natural barbarity, hurried him into all the practices of a lawle&s;s and unprincipled u&s;urper. Covering his &s;a|crilege with a veil of piety, he denominated his pretended monarchy the new kingdom of I&s;rael, and him&s;elf not only the political &s;ove|reign, but the religious high-prie&s;t and chief mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, in the new temple of the living God. One of his wives had, by her evil communication, imbibed &s;o much of his impious &s;pirit, as to think her&s;elf in&s;pired; and deeming it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h her cha|racter by &s;omething worthy of &s;uch a hu&s;|band, intimated her de&s;ign of following the example of Judith, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the Bi&s;hop of Waldeck. She was, however, &s;eized in the attempt, by the good prelate him&s;elf, who wrenched the &s;word from her hand, ju&s;t as &s;he was about to &s;trike, and was puni&s;hed on the &s;pot with the &s;ame weapon. Another of John's wives was &s;lain by his own hand, for a &s;light he&s;itation to obey his orders. His coronation, of which the ceremony was performed in the mid&s;t of his enormities, was accompanied by all the pomps of the ea&s;tern world. He always wore a crown on his head, when he pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="347" REF="366">the &s;treets on hor&s;eback. An hundred youths prepared the way, out of which was driven every living thing; yet he expected, that at due and awful di&s;tance, the &s;ides &s;hould be crouded by the pro&s;trate populace. In one hand he carried a &s;word, in another the Old Te&s;tament. For any per&s;on to be &s;een &s;tanding, or covered, in his pre&s;ence, was an offence beyond pardon, and always puni&s;hed with death.</P>
<P>So many horrors and abominations, however, did not fail, in the end, to involve their author in de&s;truction. The Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter &s;at down before the town, and determined on a regular &s;iege, during which, John's party was reduced to the mo&s;t dreadful extremities, in the &s;ore pre&s;&s;ure of which &s;ome of his faction voted for a &s;urrender. Forty-&s;even per&s;ons were be|headed, by their chief, as the forfeit of this propo&s;ition. All this time they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on cats, dogs, and, la&s;tly, one another. A wound|ed, or reluctant man was immediately &s;lain and eaten. The ferocity of the faction, and particularly of John, &s;eemed to gather force by this dreadful nouri&s;hment, and the town was at la&s;t taken by &s;tratagem. This phan|tom of maje&s;ty, who had, however, exerci&s;ed
<PB N="348" REF="367">more than kingly power, was taken alive, with many of his companions. When this de&s;pe|rate ruffian was conducted before the victorious prelate, who reproached him with his trea&s;on and profanation, he replied to the charges with an audacity &s;carce paralleled in the hi&s;tory of fallen villainy. "Spare your advice, (which is lo&s;t upon me) and li&s;ten to mine, which is of more value. You have made me your pri&s;oner. I have co&s;t you both money and blood. I have drained your trea&s;uries, and depopulated your country. Having thus been your greate&s;t enemy, I will now put you in the way of making me your be&s;t friend. My death would be a lo&s;s to you: my life may be a gain. Put me into an iron cage, carry me thus inclo&s;ed through Europe, and let a price be &s;et on the &s;ight of me. The injuries I have done your &s;tate will then be repaired, and I &s;hall, by comparing your gain with your lo&s;s, have a right to be con&s;idered, in the end, as your benefactor."</P>
<P>Part of his plan was adopted, but not that part which would, with all its ignominy, have been the mo&s;t acceptable to him, the pre&s;erva|tion of his life. As the principal author of the di&s;orders and iniquities, this was ju&s;tly for|&s;eited;
<PB N="349" REF="368">but the manner in which John's, of Leyden, was taken away, is almo&s;t too &s;hock|ing for a virtuous conqueror, con&s;idering him, too, as an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, to inflict, even, upon an impious traitor. The Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter or|dered the culprit to be fa&s;tened to a &s;take, and two executioners to tear a&s;under, &s;lowly, fir&s;t the fle&s;h, and then the members, with burning pincers; to let the operation be very delibe|rate&mdash;to avoid, for a given time, invading the vital parts, and la&s;tly, but not 'till him&s;elf, and the a&s;&s;embled multitudes, had been &s;pec|tators of more agony than human beings ought, perhaps, to look on, for the &s;ake of example, he was pierced with a &s;pear to the heart, and then his mangled body was thrown into a cage of iron, in which it hung, at the top of St. Lambert's &s;teeple, 'till time, which de&s;troys every monument of this world, whether erected to vice or virtue, mouldered it away. His accomplices &s;uffered the &s;ame fate, except that they were not caged after death, and this &s;ect expired with its chiefs. Some fruitle&s;s at|tempts have been made at Am&s;terdam to re|vive it. A party, calling them&s;elves Memno|nites, (from Memno Simons, a prie&s;t of Frieze|land, who preached this doctrine in 1536) hold in abhorrence the atrocities of Mun&s;ter, and
<PB N="350" REF="369">if certain of the&s;e Memnonites entertain &s;imilar tenets on the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m and oaths, they renounce that &s;pirit of &s;edition, fanati|ci&s;m, and revolt, which di&s;graced the adhe|rents of John of Leyden, and I am told are very peaceful, good, citizens. You will be &s;hewn, among&s;t the curio&s;ities of Leyden, the &s;hop|board on which this &s;elf-made &s;overeign worked at his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In your vi&s;it to this town, I wi&s;h to prepare you for two matters you ought to know; the one is a &s;ettled and indi&s;pen&s;ible ceremony of pulling off your hat, in an&s;wer to a mo&s;t trouble&s;ome civility you will receive from every pa&s;&s;enger of every de&s;cription; it being a cu&s;|tom throughout Holland, in general, and Ley|den, in particular, to make a very profound obei&s;ance to every &s;tranger, and to expect the &s;ame in return: in&s;omuch that a traveller ought to lay his account for a hat extraordi|nary, in making a tour of the &s;even provinces. In the great &s;treet of Leyden, which is an Engli&s;h mile long, I have been obliged to bow my&s;elf out of half my hat, and all my pa|tience; and what is the more provoking, if you meet the &s;ame people twenty times in a walk, the like ceremony is inflicted upon you,
<PB N="351" REF="370">without any compromi&s;e being made for for|mer civility. "Booing, booing, booing, boo|ing," as Macklin's "Man of the World" &s;ays, all day long. Add to which, a Dutch bow is in it&s;elf a ridiculous and di&s;gu&s;ting piece of formality. The hand is lifted to the head, and the hat held up at arm's length and height, and replaced with &s;o much deliberation, that you may walk fifty paces during the operation; and this is &s;o frequently repeated, that the hat has &s;carce time to regain its u&s;ual place before a fre&s;h pa&s;&s;enger &s;ends it off again. But the whole of this is performed with &s;uch ineffable <HI>&s;ang-froid,</HI> that the head &s;eems as in&s;en&s;ible as the hat. Not a fearure appears con&s;cious of the &s;alutation; not a mu&s;cle moves in corre&s;|pondence with the greeting&mdash;it is altogether a mechanical act, and you have nothing for it but to take off and put on your hat, and go about your bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;econd article, not le&s;s vexatious, is the importunate intru&s;ion of a pack of fellows who call them&s;elves porters, who almo&s;t pluck your baggage, though but a &s;mall parcel in your handkerchief, out of your hand, and are more trouble&s;ome to get rid off than Horace's Impertinent. If you refu&s;e their &s;ervices, they are &s;aucy. If you accept them, they are ob&s;equious, even to fawning.
<PB N="352" REF="371">Thus, almo&s;t every body in this town, when they intend to be polite, are

<P>The French, it has been &s;een and felt, are capable of every thing great, every thing little; but after all, if they do not continue to mend on them&s;elves, they will do nothing but make a dire gap in creation, and fill it up with blood.

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Leyden.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AMONGST the plea&s;ant events of my Dutch excur&s;ion, is to be enumerated my meeting with a friend,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Pinckard, of Great Ru&s;&s;el-Street, Bloom&s;bury.</NOTE> who&s;e &s;ocial manners, and intellectual qualities, without taking his profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill into the account, though to <HI>that</HI> I am indebted for the pre&s;erva|tion of my health, would have made me quit the &s;cene of our rencontre with regret, had it been even in Siberia, if the &s;eparation had not been &s;olaced by the hope of, again, meet|ing in England. To this accompli&s;hed man, who, you know, has, &s;ince his &s;tudies, and tra+vels, were fini&s;hed, "bettered this report," to his own honour, I am indebted for &s;ome valu|able hints, re&s;pecting the Leyden univer&s;ity. They will be found in the clo&s;e of this letter, but I will fir&s;t glean his remarks, on the Dutch, in general; therein, fairly, giving you both &s;ides
<PB N="355" REF="374">of the picture; for our features of the coun|try, and people, are not exactly alike.</P>
<P><Q>Your laudable attempt to re&s;cue the am|phibia of this aqueous region, from the charge of <HI>inho&s;pitality,</HI></Q> &s;aid the Doctor, af|ter having read my account, <Q>will, at all events, be a novelty. In the execution of it, you will, &s;urely, fall under no &s;u&s;picion of plagiari&s;m. The intent is prai&s;e-worthy, and in perfect uni&s;on with your charitable mind. Prejudice, I am ready to allow, is a &s;ad bane; and its operation, on the minds of Engli&s;h touri&s;ts, but too general: yet, there are, I would hope, among our country|men, &s;ome who have removed this moth from their eyes. The&s;e, however, &s;till join the throng in one common opinion of this race of aquatics.</Q> I admitted the <HI>opinion;</HI> but not its validity, unle&s;s with very large ex|ceptions.</P>
<P><Q>For my own part, although not yet enough a citizen of the world, to think <HI>any</HI> other country equal to our happy i&s;le,</Q> continued my friend, <Q>nor &s;o much a &s;tay-at-home tra|veller, as to build my faith, wholly, on the reports of ha&s;ty journali&s;ts; yet I cannot but
<PB N="356" REF="375">confe&s;s, after a long re&s;idence among them, that I have felt my&s;elf inclined to enli&s;t with the multitude, re&s;pecting this prominent feature, in the character of the Dutch people. Many in&s;tances could I relate to you, that have come within my own ob&s;ervation, which would militate, &s;trongly, again&s;t the defence your benevolence induces you to plead in their behalf. On the other hand, it were but ju&s;t to acknowledge that I have experi|enced &s;ome &s;ignal marks of ho&s;pitality in the&s;e provinces: but I fear you will, inflex|ibly, cla&s;s me among the &s;tay-at-home&mdash;the prejudiced&mdash;the ill-humoured part of our countrymen, when I tell you, that it has, only, been in &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> families, who&s;e na|ture has not changed with their change of abode.</Q> "You have been out of luck, my dear Doctor," &s;aid I. "And you," an&s;wered he, <Q>have, &s;urely, been peculiarly happy, in the &s;ociety you have found, &s;ince your arrival here, that the excellent fruit, which others have &s;ought in vain, &s;hould &s;eem to pre&s;ent it&s;elf, to you, as the common harve&s;t of the country.</Q> Not as the harve&s;t, but very good pickings, indeed, for a Gleaner, Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="376"><Q>Some, I fear, &s;till firm in their faith, may be uncharitable enough to &s;u&s;pect,</Q> re&s;umed he, <Q>that the kind <HI>Mynheers,</HI> and their <HI>Vrowes,</HI> with whom you a&s;&s;ociate, had received pri|vate intimation, that &s;o able, and benevolent, an advocate had journied hither <HI>to glean them.</HI> Others, alike adhering to their former opinion, &s;peculating on the title of your in|tended work, will, perhaps, contend that the numerous cla&s;s, who have preceded you, have brought to market the real crop of the country; whil&s;t a Gleaner, alone, from bend|ing, and looking nearer to the &s;oil, and re+maining, from the very nature of his labours, longer upon it, hath been enabled to collect the few blades of ho&s;pitality, &s;o thinly &s;cat|tered over the land&mdash;and which, having picked up, you, &s;o joyfully, bind in your valuable &s;heaves.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;miled, bowed, and &s;uffered my ingenious friend to proceed.</P>
<P><Q>A friend of mine, who has &s;pent more time in Holland than has yet fallen to the lot, either of you, or my&s;elf, has, &s;ometimes, &s;aid to me, he could almo&s;t imagine, that, like their ha|bits, the language of the Dutch did not admit
<PB N="358" REF="377">of any term &s;ynonimous to, what is generally under&s;tood by, the Engli&s;h word <HI>ho&s;pitality;</HI> and this being the only part of your work I cannot &s;ub&s;cribe to, I may confe&s;s to you, that from the general want of candour and liberality in their dealings, and the repeated in&s;tances of penury and avarice, which I have witne&s;&s;ed, &s;ince the time of my be|coming a re&s;ident among them, I have, more than once, been half inclined to think &s;o too.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At the metropolis, of the&s;e &s;tates, you will find a certain portion of the city appropriated to the re&s;idence of the Jews. This part is called the Jew's quarter of Am&s;terdam. Were we to judge from their u&s;ual dealings, and mode of traffick, with equal propriety might we term the whole country of the Hol|landers, <HI>the Jewi&s;h quarter of Europe.</HI> Even <HI>you,</HI> I fear, friendly as you are di&s;po&s;ed to|wards them, cannot but acknowledge, that, to deal with a Dutchman, it behoves every one, to con&s;ider him&s;elf encountering a Jew, who will, not only, contend as ob&s;tinately for the la&s;t doight, as old Shylock for the pound of fle&s;h, but who will, certainly, impo&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, and take every unfair advantage.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="378">Ju&s;t as in England, with an Engli&s;hman, my dear friend; but individual vice, or vir|tue, has nothing to do with national character, &s;aid I.</P>
<P><Q>I have been &s;orry to learn, that among the Engli&s;h, who have migrated to this coun|try,</Q> ob&s;erved the Doctor, pur&s;uing his point, <Q>the common reported Dutch principle often proves rapidly contagious, and that, from breathing the &s;ame air, they &s;oon im|bibe the infection, and degenerate into the amphibious &s;ons of penury and avarice.&mdash; Of the&s;e Dutchified Britons, &s;ome &s;pecimens have come under my own ob&s;ervation.</Q></P>
<P>Why truly, an&s;wered I, if I did not "eat in <HI>memory</HI> the cu&s;tard of ye&s;terday," I partook at your table, I &s;hould think &s;o too.</P>
<P>"As to Leyden," rejoined my friend, <Q>I am much intere&s;ted in wi&s;hing it may abound in Gleanings. Prepare your&s;elf for a long vi&s;it; and remember, that, in the intervals, between your gleaning hours, I &s;hall hope to enjoy the lea&s;ings of your &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The tedious and methodic &s;y&s;tem of bowing, for which the inhabitants of this city have a peculiar fondne&s;s, will furni&s;h an ear or two
<PB N="360" REF="379">for your &s;tore-hou&s;e. In de&s;cription, touched by the comic quill, it would afford a facetious mor&s;el for <HI>John Bull.</HI> To &s;uch an ab&s;urd degree do they carry this cu&s;tom, that it is common to &s;ee them bowing to the window, where an acquaintance, occa&s;ionally, &s;its, when no per&s;on is near it; or to a friend's coach, as it pa&s;&s;es them in the &s;treet, al|though no one be in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Neat and clean as are all the towns in Hol|land, Leyden exceeds, perhaps, the whole of them. Its &s;treets&mdash;its buildings&mdash;its canals, all combine to give it the pre-eminence. It is a place well adapted to &s;tudy, for, although a large city, it is &s;o &s;till and quiet, that we feel our&s;elves in perfect retirement. Its uni|ver&s;ity, &s;o much renowned, you will, pro|bably, find to have been &s;o clo&s;ely <HI>mowed, reaped, and raked over and over,</HI> that, in this particular, it offers but a &s;canty &s;upply to a Gleaner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>High as the fame of this &s;chool was rai&s;ed by the uncommon talents of the celebrated Boerhaave, it is but little wonderful that the doctrines of that great man &s;hould be &s;low in their decline. In the eyes of the pre&s;ent
<PB N="361" REF="380">profe&s;&s;ors, they have not lo&s;t their charms. The humoral pathology has &s;till its ad|mirers&mdash;&s;pontaneous gluten, lentor, and acrimony of the fluids, yet boa&s;t their advo|cates. In Holland, innovations in medicine are thought more dangerous, than in politics: political opinions, indeed, excepted, the Dutch have a known dread at every &s;pecies of change or reform: their perver&s;e and ob|&s;tinate nature compels them to plod over the old ta&s;k, coldly refu&s;ing all the benefits of new di&s;coveries. To an <HI>el&egrave;ve</HI> of the Briti&s;h &s;chools it is matter of &s;urpri&s;e to hear a learned profe&s;&s;or &s;upporting, with his ut|mo&s;t eloquence, theories which <HI>he</HI> has been taught to con&s;ider as old and exploded, and which have been proved hypothetical and ab&s;urd.</Q></P>
<P>Talk thus, my friend, &s;aid I, and you will meet no interruption, from the Gleaner, I pro|mi&s;e you.</P>
<P><Q>It &s;eems within the natural cour&s;e of re|volutions, that this celebrated univer&s;ity," &s;aid the Doctor, "&s;hould now yield the palm to Edinburgh; which, from the great abili|ties, and ingenuity, of the profe&s;&s;ors, together
<PB N="362" REF="381">with the excellent regulations, and arrange|ments, for the improvement of the &s;tudents, is, at this period, beyond all doubt, the fir&s;t medical &s;chool in Europe.</Q> I bowed a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>"In Leyden," continued my friend, <Q>the different branches of natural hi&s;tory are taught with great preci&s;ion, and with much atten|tion, to methodical, and &s;y&s;tematic, arrange|ment. The botanic garden is, perhaps, un|rivalled. It is a mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition to the &s;tudents, being a very exten&s;ive, and u&s;eful, collection of plants, admirably, and methodically, arranged, according to the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The mode of graduation, at this univer&s;ity, may, perhaps, &s;upply a few ears to an indu&s;|trious Gleaner.</Q> I pray you add them to my &s;tore, &s;aid I. "Mo&s;t gladly," replied the Doctor. "It has, by &s;ome, been &s;aid," rejoin|ed he, <Q>that a &s;tudent offering him&s;elf a candidate for a degree, at Leyden, finds little difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing his examinations. This may be very true, provided he be well pre|pared, but not otherwi&s;e; and, thus, the ob|&s;ervation applies, equally, to every <HI>other</HI> &s;chool. The tryals, to which the candidate
<PB N="363" REF="382">mu&s;t &s;ubmit, previous to obtaining his de|gree, are, perhaps, at no univer&s;ity more &s;e|vere, certainly, at none more general, and u&s;eful, than at Leyden. It may be ob&s;erved, that the examinations, to which, in any &s;chool, a &s;tudent is &s;ubjected, on his &s;eeking literary honours, are, like all &s;ubjects, of which we can form no di&s;tinct idea, very much magnified by anticipation. He knows not what he has to undergo; but he knows, and feels, powerfully, the po&s;&s;ibility of fai|lure, and of being &s;ent back, in di&s;grace, to his &s;tudies. This is fully &s;ufficient to mul|tiply the magnitude of the ta&s;k, in his mind, to a &s;omething tremendous&mdash;to a &s;omething that he feels a kind of terror at meeting. To this it is, probably, owing, that, afterwards, when the tryal is over, and he has nothing further to apprehend, he reduces it, below what he actually found it, and is led to join tho&s;e who have gone before him, in &s;peaking of the examination, he has pa&s;&s;ed, as &s;light or trivial. That this is the fact would &s;eem, indeed, to be proved, by his not being able to impre&s;s the next that follows him with the&s;e feelings&mdash;nor to maintain them, him|&s;elf, when again called to tryal.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="383"><Q>As this routine has come under my own eye, and has been the &s;ubject of my frequent ob&s;ervation, I will, if you plea&s;e, undertake to glean it for you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The fir&s;t &s;tep, towards a graduation at Ley|den, is the &s;tudent pre&s;enting him&s;elf before the Rector Magnificus, to have his name re|gi&s;tered on the books of the college. This done, he is called to an examination before the Dean; which is a long tryal, and of more general, and u&s;eful, tendency than is com|monly pa&s;&s;ed in other &s;chools. You under|&s;tand that I am &s;peaking of a graduate in medicine. If his re&s;pon&s;es are &s;atisfactory, and the Dean thinks him eligible, he is now admitted a candidate for his degree. After a few days, he is called before the Faculty of Medicine. At this meeting, the que&s;tions are, u&s;ually, confined to &s;ome particular vi&s;|cus of the body, and relate to its &s;ituation, &s;tructure, and functions; the di&s;ea&s;es pecu|liar to it; and the method of curing &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es. If the replies are approved by the Faculty, the candidate is next pre&s;ented with two aphori&s;ms, on which he is to write com|mentaries, and to appear, with them, at the college; on the following day, at noon, when he undergoes a third examination, by
<PB N="365" REF="384">defending the expo&s;itions he has written, again&s;t the objections of the faculty. It is not until after this third tryal, that he can have the &s;atisfaction of knowing whether he will obtain his degree. If, in his an&s;wers, he has given proof of his abilities, and his cen&s;ors think him &s;ufficiently qualified, he has next to produce a di&s;&s;ertation, on &s;ome medical or philo&s;ophical &s;ubject, to be ap|proved by the per&s;on, whom, the Dean ap|points his promoter. Such approbation be|ing &s;ignified to the candidate, he has the pri|vilege of fixing the period of his fourth or final examination; when he is required to defend his di&s;&s;ertation, in public, before the whole Senatus Academicus. The commen|taries, and the di&s;&s;ertation, are written, and the whole of the examinations pa&s;&s;ed, in the Latin language.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The number of &s;tudents educated at this univer&s;ity, has much decrea&s;ed &s;ince the days of Boerhaave, but is &s;till &s;ufficient to add, materially, to the trade, and to the riches, of the city. They are not re&s;tricted to any re|gulations, or college rules, as in Oxford and Cambridge, but, as at Edinburgh, are left to their own indu&s;try, and emulation, in the pro|&s;ecution of their &s;tudies.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="385"><Q>Many of the inhabitants, at Leyden, have apartments which are kept expre&s;sly for the &s;tudents. The&s;e are, commonly, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by a piece of board, hung at the window, on which is written <HI>cubicula locanda,</HI></Q></P>
<P>A thou&s;and thanks, my dear Doctor, &s;aid I, for the&s;e e&s;timable remarks, about which we agree entirely; and as we only are in conten|tion about the &s;ubject of the <HI>ho&s;pitality</HI> of the country, you &s;hall, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, give me another good dinner, and each of your <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> families another, by way of proving to me how far the imputed avarice of the land has been epidemic among&s;t the Briti&s;h re&s;i|dents; and, in return, I will take you, by the hand, to as many <HI>Dutch</HI> hou&s;es, dinner for dinner, bottle for bottle, and, then, we will, at the clo&s;e of the account, &s;ee how &s;tands the balance of good-fellow&s;hip, and civility. "Agreed," exclaimed the Doctor, <Q>and, after all, we &s;hall, mo&s;t likely, maintain our pre|&s;ent opinions.</Q> No doubt, &s;aid I, then, all that can be &s;aid, is, that I have been, in this re&s;pect, a fortunate&mdash;you, a luckle&s;s, traveller.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Holland.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you, my friend, for the box of Engli&s;h new&s;papers. They are the "brief chronicles of the times," and an acceptable pre&s;ent to a Briti&s;h traveller, who feels an anxi|ous de&s;ire to know what is doing at home, while he is roaming abroad: and who, be his &s;ituation what it may, ca&s;ts
<Q>"Many a longing, lingering, look behind."</Q></P>
<P>Indeed a man cannot traver&s;e any part of the Continent of Europe, without, almo&s;t imme|diately, pronouncing our country to be the mo&s;t new&s;paper-loving nation in the world. Yet it appears to be a mere national prejudice, to tell a &s;tranger the city of London publi&s;hes more papers in a week, than the re&s;t of Europe in a year. On my a&s;&s;erting, at what is called a <HI>&s;ociet&egrave;,</HI> (club) while at Am&s;terdam, that the metropolis of England could di&s;po&s;e of near twenty papers of a day, on an average of fif|teen
<PB N="368" REF="387">hundred each, that the Morning Herald, St. James's Chronicle, and &s;everal others, were productive of &s;ome thou&s;and pounds a-year, net money, to the proprietors; be&s;ides yield|ing a large &s;um to the revenue; I was looked on as giving my country a pretty hand&s;ome puff. A &s;ly, old man, who was &s;moking his pipe in the corner of a coffee-hou&s;e, where I had made this a&s;&s;ertion, ob&s;erved, as he took his pipe out of his mouth, "Your countrymen ought to be great politicians." He then re|capitulated all I had &s;aid on the &s;ubject, then re&s;orted again to his pipe, &s;till pre&s;erving the &s;ame incredulous &s;et of tones and features, marking his di&s;belief of every &s;entence with a whiff, &s;ignifying that it was &s;moke. "And &s;o you &s;ay, Mr. Engli&s;hman, your city of London can &s;ell &s;o many thou&s;and prints of a day!" Yes. "Whew!" replied he, "And &s;ome of your citizens net a thou&s;and, or two, of Engli&s;h guineas, independently of royal impo&s;ts!" More. In an&s;wer to this, a drawing in of the breath, and a whiff full in my face; that &s;uc|ceeded by another, as if intended to blind, or &s;uffocate, me for the lie direct.</P>
<P>In de&s;pite of this, however, I went on. But our new&s;papers are not le&s;s the vehicles of
<PB N="369" REF="388">politics, than of fa&s;hion: they are equally adapted to the cabinet of a mini&s;ter, as to the tea-table of a lady. (The &s;moker &s;tared, and again drew in). They are the repo&s;itories of our dre&s;&s;es, amu&s;ements and amours. (The breath &s;till &s;ucked in &s;trongly.) 'Tis a &s;ort of &s;oleci&s;m in politene&s;s, not to have one, at lea&s;t, &s;erved up with breakfa&s;t; the afore&s;aid Morn|ing Herald, the Oracle, Morning Chronicle, Star, Sun, Moon, Diary, Public Adverti&s;er, Gazetteer, or &s;ome other. And each co&s;ts three &s;tivers, or I believe, &s;ince the la&s;t re|gulations, four: but I am convinced if they co&s;t fourteen, the curio&s;ity of the Engli&s;h nation would pay up to their price, and when taken fre&s;h at breakfa&s;t, not a Dutch break|fa&s;t, without tea-&s;poons, or &s;ugar, or bread, but with all the luxuries of the tea equipage, an Engli&s;hman, "has &s;tomach for them all!" <HI>"Ugh!"</HI> &s;aid the Dutchman betwixt a &s;igh and &s;uck! "Four &s;tivers!" Yes, and per&s;ons of condition mu&s;t have &s;everal. In &s;ome families, as many as there are cups and &s;aucers: though they never la&s;t longer than the hour of break|fa&s;t, which furni&s;hes by the help of the&s;e hi&s;torians of the morning, plenty of &s;light or &s;ub&s;tantial topics, for the re&s;t of the day. Love, hate, an enemy to be cen&s;ured, a friend
<PB N="370" REF="389">to be prai&s;ed, a beauty to be &s;et off, a rival to be decried, a mini&s;ter to be &s;couted, an op|po&s;itioni&s;t to be put into his place: a &s;candal a&s;&s;erted, denied, re-a&s;&s;erted, re-denied. In &s;hort, an Engli&s;h new&s;paper is a book of uni|ver&s;al u&s;e, knowledge, and information, and is as nece&s;&s;ary to a man or woman, of any pre|ten&s;ion to ta&s;te, as powder in the hair, or a watch in the pocket. The man of &s;moke had by this time gathered a mouthful; his cheeks inflated; and he looked as if he was taking aim.</P>
<P>Not continued I, carele&s;sly, that they are univer&s;ally read. In private hou&s;es, there are on an average, five overlookers to one ex|aminer. The females of a family only &s;kim the &s;candal and amu&s;ements, mixing a little of both with each di&s;h of tea&mdash;a kind of &s;enti|mental cream, which is &s;aid to give a mo&s;t de|lightful flavor to the repa&s;t: the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion, betwixt every piece of bread and butter, lays a &s;lice of politics, more reli&s;hing to him than the bread and butter it&s;elf, and fre&s;h made from that prolific milch-cow, the public: and although when &s;he has yielded a brimming pail, in one column, &s;he frequently kicks it down in the next, till the &s;weete&s;t intelligence,
<PB N="371" REF="390">(whether for or again&s;t the mini&s;try) all turns four on the &s;tomach, the good man would find &s;omething wanting were he not to &s;ee a fre&s;h &s;upply &s;erved up the next morning. Thou|&s;ands read only the price of &s;tocks, which though contained generally in an inch of news, (here a grand puff at me) is chearfully paid for in the &s;um of three or four &s;tivers. Thou&s;ands divert them&s;elves only with the robberies, mur|ders, deaths, and marriages, all of which might be packed in a walnut &s;hell, and leave room almo&s;t for the bankruptcies. When I had gained this &s;entence, through fire and &s;moke, all that my principal auditor had collected into his mouth, during the relation, was di&s;charged in my face, which it enveloped in clouds. And, pray, interrogated the puffer, where do you find room for your long hi&s;tory of pick|pockets and highwaymen, for I am told, you have as many rogues in a day as new&s;papers! What do you take us for, Mr. Traveller: do you recollect that we are too near neighbours, to &s;wallow all this! (&s;wallowing a large quan|tity of &s;moke, as if to imitate the action) I in&s;i&s;ted upon the truth of my a&s;&s;ertions, which made my &s;moker &s;eriou&s;ly angry: he &s;hook &s;ome of the fire from his pipe, then mouthed it again; and as he walked backwards, and for|wards,
<PB N="372" REF="391">whiffed off &s;everal puffs in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in&s;i&s;ting that the number of papers publi&s;hed in Am&s;terdam, did not exceed a paper a day, or two at mo&s;t, and that they contained all that was nece&s;&s;ary; adding, as to amu&s;ements, &s;candal, &amp;c. he looked on them only as &s;kim milk; and the latter &s;till wor&s;e&mdash;&s;kim milk turned &s;our. But you Engli&s;hmen, as all the world knows, are great <HI>travellers,</HI> and ever ready to take advantage of us, poor, &s;tay-at|home people&mdash;he, he, he!! The empha&s;is on the word <HI>travellers,</HI> and the bitter irony in the laugh, aggravated by the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tic &s;et of &s;nuff-coloured features, in turn, vexed <HI>me,</HI> and, knowing that a fellow of this ca&s;t is be&s;t pu|ni&s;hed by him&s;elf, I rai&s;ed my voice a pitch higher, to inform him, that every &s;yllable I had uttered, re&s;pecting the quantity, and quality of Engli&s;h new&s;papers was true, and that more|over there were tens of thou&s;ands, in the city of London, and its environs, who took in, and paid yearly for one or more of the &s;aid papers, without reading a paragraph in a month.</P>
<P>This, though, as you know, my friend, literally true, was a great deal too much for my &s;moke|dried veteran, who, throwing down his pipe, and the price of the coffee, with which he had
<PB N="373" REF="392">moi&s;tened it, and then throwing an old thread|bare blue cloak acro&s;s his &s;houlders, took off his hat with the mo&s;t ludicrous &s;olemnity, and hobbled off thanking me for my BRUSSELS <HI>Gazette Extraordinary.</HI> When he was gone &s;ome German gentlemen ob&s;erved, that they &s;aw I was re&s;olved to play on the old fellow, and that he de&s;erved it for his rudene&s;s; and, indeed for his not &s;eeing more clearly, I was in je&s;t; for, added they, we live in a very large town in Germany, where the Engli&s;h paper comes from London, and had been told it was the be&s;t of the three to be had in that city.</P>
<P>Such are the prejudices of nations. But I perceive among&s;t the bundles you have &s;ent me, is a Gazette Extraordinary <HI>indeed.</HI> You have marked one paragraph therein with your pen|cil, and archly underwrote this brief epitaph, <HI>Alas, poor Gleaner!</HI> In the very in&s;tant that I thus &s;port with the pen, holding it lightly be|tween my fingers, corre&s;ponding to the light|ne&s;s of my heart, which bounds with plea&s;ure on the receipt of your letter and parcel; and at the novelty of unclouded &s;pirits, after the depre&s;&s;ions of &s;ickne&s;s, <HI>I &s;ee that I am dead.</HI> I breathed my la&s;t, it &s;eems at Coblentz. As I purpo&s;e Gleaning that city in due time, I
<PB N="374" REF="393">intend to pay due re&s;pect to the &s;pot where I was buried, vi&s;it my own grave, and write my own epitaph. Though you humourou&s;ly in|form me that has been already done for me in a very hand&s;ome manner, by my friends, in Eng|land. This is the third time in the cour&s;e of my life, that I have been put to death, in the new&s;papers, without my con&s;ent or know|ledge.
<Q>"Thrice they &s;lew the &s;lain."</Q> And, let me a&s;&s;ure you,
<Q>"Thrice have I liv'd again."</Q> True, indeed, I was taken out of the world &s;uddenly, and once went off after a lingering &s;ickne&s;s. But to &s;hew that the principle of charity &s;till &s;urvives in me, I forgive all tho&s;e who have had a hand in my death, with all my heart; and really, at this good natured moment, feel a &s;ort of reluctance, at the im|po&s;&s;ibility of giving my friends this public &s;atis|faction of knowing I am in the land of the living, without, at the &s;ame time, di&s;appointing tho&s;e, if any &s;uch there be, who have derived any &s;atisfaction in numbering me with the dead. By way of con&s;olation, however, I will have the kindne&s;s to inform them that, notwith&s;tanding,
<Q><PB N="375" REF="394">
<L>"In all my wanderings round this world of care,</L>
<L>"In all my griefs, and God has giv'n my &s;hare."</L></Q> I am ju&s;t now in general good &s;pirits and health, they may expect in &s;omething le&s;s than a hundred years, to have the plea&s;ant intel|ligence confirmed. Meantime, I heartily wi&s;h them, and you, my friends and enemies, the comfort of being killed only upon paper, for many years to come; with the additional <HI>agr&eacute;|ment</HI> of revi&s;iting the country where they died as often as they plea&s;e! If it contains the lovely &s;cenery which blooms round Coblentz, where I have been &s;o long entombed; and which &s;cenery I have in &s;tore for you; their happy gho&s;ts, mi&s;taking it, perhaps, for the Ely&s;ian Fields, might not "be fond to re&s;ign it."</P>
<P>But, gracious Providence! what will not <HI>we bear,</HI> and <HI>l'on dit,</HI> tho&s;e two well-informed per&s;onages, who know every thing that has, and has <HI>not</HI> happened, &s;ay? Since I have been upon the Continent, I have been a&s;&s;ured of &s;o many events having taken place to my&s;elf and others, not one of which ever did, will, or can happen, in politics, in civil, or in <HI>uncivil</HI> matters, that, methinks it would be a plea&s;ant work to bring under one point of view, a col|lection
<PB N="376" REF="395">of <HI>l'on dits,</HI> and <HI>we hears,</HI> or the rumour book of <HI>what was &s;aid to be,</HI> which was not, for the new-year. It might be publi&s;hed, you know, with the almanacks, and, I que&s;tion, whether even Mr. Newberry ever yet offered his little or great readers, a book half &s;o full of pretty and wonderful <HI>&s;tories.</HI></P>
<P>But in another of the papers you have &s;ent me, I di&s;cover a &s;econd pencil mark, accom|panied by reque&s;ts thus expre&s;&s;ed: "This mu&s;t be Gleaned." You remember, it is oppo|&s;ite the little funeral tribute I paid to the death|devoted hor&s;e, of my beloved friend

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Haarlem.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING my avowed and inveterate quarrel with brick and mortar, I &s;hould be &s;trongly tempted to woo the de|&s;criptive Mu&s;e, and make a long pau&s;e in this charming town, till &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to &s;ing the various beauties of Mr. Hope's delightful villa, but, for a rea&s;on &s;tronger than the temptation, and yet the mo&s;t &s;imple that can be imagined, namely, becau&s;e it truly <HI>"beggars</HI> de&s;cription."</P>
<P>Into this little Paradi&s;e the worthy proprietor has contrived to bring every thing that the arts, or their happie&s;t votaries could furni&s;h, that fortune could procure, or ta&s;te arrange. Could we &s;uppo&s;e a man of the fine&s;t fortune to be at the &s;ame time a man of the fine&s;t ta&s;te, which is, by the bye, &s;uppo&s;ing a very rare a&s;&s;emblage, and which the Gods who made him poetical commonly refu&s;e; and
<PB N="383" REF="402">could we even to the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions adjoin the mo&s;t correct judgement, the hou&s;e at Haarlem would be the exact re&s;idence of &s;o adorned a proprietor; &s;ince it actually contains and il|lu&s;trates whatever
<Q><L>"Painting can expre&s;s,</L>
<L>"Or youthful poets fancy when they love."</L></Q> It contains al&s;o, my friend, what is far better than either poetry or painting&mdash;an highly e&s;ti|mable character, being, indeed, but one thing more elegant and beautiful than this villa, and that is, the heart of its owner, which is among&s;t "the noble&s;t works of God." Every per&s;on of every de&s;cription is the hi&s;torian of Mr. Hope; and he is one of the very rare excep|tions of being &s;poken well of by every body, and de&s;erving it. The&s;e univer&s;ally-prai&s;ed characters being, I have ob&s;erved, nine times out of ten, the objects of determined panegy|ric, nobody knows why or wherefore; ju&s;t in like proportion as tho&s;e whom this &s;ame every body has &s;elected as a mark,
<Q>"for &s;corn to point the moving finger at,"</Q> is de&s;erving better report. I have, at this moment, the honour, and it is my pride al&s;o,
<PB N="384" REF="403">to know a man of whom all po&s;&s;ible ill has been publickly &s;poken, and who merits a character where thou&s;ands, whom he has melted by his charity, animated by his affection, or informed by his wi&s;dom, have written it&mdash;in their heart's core&mdash;where, long &s;ince, I have written your's, my friend: and this mo&s;t excellent and mo&s;t abu&s;ed man is &s;till labouring under a load of accu&s;ations that a fiend would blu&s;h at.</P>
<P>The trial of Warren Ha&s;tings is as much the conver&s;ation abroad as at home, and it is uni|formly &s;poken of with wonder, generally with indignation, as the darke&s;t ingratitude of his countrymen for pre&s;erving their country! a recompen&s;e too often attending the publick benefactor of <HI>every</HI> country.</P>
<P>Although, in point of <HI>corre&s;pondence,</HI> I have now brought you, my e&s;timable friend, no far|ther than Haarlem; in point of <HI>travel,</HI> I have therein mingled the remarks of &s;ome years, and you will, all along, under&s;tand that whatever I offer is the re&s;ult of my frequent vi&s;its or re|&s;idence as well in Holland, as other countries. The reflections, therefore, which I pre&s;ent to you, are rarely the con&s;equence of immediate notice at the moment of writing to you, but are &s;trong confirmations of what has been &s;een
<PB N="385" REF="404">and felt during the cour&s;e of tho&s;e re&s;idences and vi&s;its, fully re&s;olved to exemplify what the valuable Dr. Moore (who&s;e ob&s;ervations are not more &s;prightly than &s;olid) has &s;aid on this very &s;ubject, viz. "truly to know people and places it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ide in, and among&s;t them, a con&s;iderable time."</P>
<P>It is then, after having, in a tour of &s;ome years, round and acro&s;s many countries (which a rapid trippi&s;t would have &s;kimmed with a dizzy kind of &s;peed, that &s;ees nothing di&s;tinctly, and which certainly a right-on traveller might pa&s;s in a few weeks,) that I will now give you the collected evidence of different countries, gleaned at different opportunities, on the &s;ub|ject of the pro&s;ecution &s;till, as you inform me, carrying on in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</P>
<P>No man, who has not been abroad, can conceive the degree of a&s;toni&s;hment, which accompanies the &s;lighte&s;t mention of this matter to foreigners. They a&s;ked the Gleaner for an explanation of paradoxes. <Q>Why do you bring to a tribunal of public ju&s;tice a public be|nefactor? Why are you making him poor, who hath made you rich? Why do the In|dians uniformly &s;ing the prai&s;es of the man,
<PB N="386" REF="405">whom the Engli&s;h have &s;elected for cen&s;ure, on the pretence of his having dealt cruelly by tho&s;e very Indians, who are the loude&s;t in his panegyric?</Q> The Gleaner tells them, that the like que&s;tions are continually made (without receiving any &s;atisfactory reply) by the people of England. He owns him&s;elf to be one of the thou&s;ands who want &s;agacity to &s;olve the mo&s;t palpable contradictions; and that, therefore, he is bewildered, like them|&s;elves, to account for the &s;uppo&s;ed union of the darke&s;t vices, and brighte&s;t virtues, in the &s;ame mind: or how the mo&s;t melting charity and &s;avage, hard-hearted avarice, the &s;ofte&s;t affections, and mo&s;t de&s;potic exerci&s;e of the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t boundle&s;s genero&s;ity, with the mo&s;t &s;ordid exaction, can a&s;&s;emble in the &s;ame bo&s;om. But, &s;ay they, we under|&s;tand that the chief conductor of the&s;e contra|dictions is a man of &s;plendid talents and vir|tues, and that he has brought him&s;elf to be|lieve his accu&s;ations well-founded, although he cannot but know that the exce&s;&s;es of virtue and vice in the &s;ame character are incompa|tible. That the be&s;t men have frailties we all admit; and that the wor&s;t have &s;ome qualities le&s;s pernicious and dete&s;table than others, is no le&s;s unque&s;tionable; but to be at once emi|nently
<PB N="387" REF="406">di&s;tingui&s;hed for tenderne&s;s, and rigour, for bounty and rapacity, for honourable deal|ing, and for di&s;graceful tricking, are contra|rieties that nature her&s;elf forbids to meet: <Q>And yet your nation has &s;ound them to co|here in the brea&s;t of Mr. Ha&s;tings,</Q> ob&s;erve they, <Q>&s;ince we do not find that the mo&s;t virulent of tho&s;e who are brought in evidence again&s;t him, deny him this &s;trange mixture of qualities. Tell us the fact?</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg, returned the Gleaner, to de|cline involving my&s;elf and you in the labyrinths of this que&s;tion, the an&s;wers to which have, for more than three years pa&s;t filled the pre&s;&s;es of Great Britain; and the puzzle remains. But of the man thus accu&s;ed of every thing ba&s;e, on the one hand, and to whom has been attributed every thing great and good on the other, I will give you a little anecdote, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t you, perhaps, more than all that has been written, to form your own judg|ment. It is, indeed, a very minute incident, yet of great account as to that part of your que&s;tion which enquires after general di&s;po|&s;ition and character. I &s;hall only pre&s;ume that the truth of the circum&s;tance is indubitable.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="407"><Q>This mo&s;t injured and mo&s;t excellent man, (&s;ays the recorder of the anecdote) was walk|ing at early day in his plea&s;ure grounds, near Wind&s;or, when were exhibited the follow|ing traits of a heart replete with the noble&s;t virtues, though charged with the foule&s;t crimes.</Q></P>
<P>"As an un&s;een &s;pectator," continues the re|later, <Q>I beheld Warren Ha&s;tings going along a narrow path-way, in a zig-zag kind of manner, &s;ometimes &s;topping &s;uddenly, &s;ome|times cautiou&s;ly &s;etting his foot forward, retrograde, and &s;ideway, as if he trod with fear and trembling: and this circum&s;pect movement he continued till he was lo&s;t to my view amid&s;t the windings of the walk. So &s;trange a procedure, however, &s;trongly excited my curio&s;ity, and I left the chamber in which I was then &s;itting, to explore the cau&s;e. On reaching the &s;pot, I perceived an emmet's ne&s;t on one &s;ide of the walk, and the indu&s;trious proprietors of it called forth by the warmth of the morning, had &s;pread them&s;elves over the path-way. The de&s;ign of the de&s;troyer of &s;o many thou&s;ands of the human race was &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid doing any injury to the&s;e poor ants. I traced, with a
<PB N="389" REF="408">kind of benevolent joy, the Governor-Ge|neral's foot&s;teps, in which crooked, irregu|lar, and broken, as they were, I could plainly perceive the impre&s;&s;ions of the tendere&s;t heart, who&s;e very in&s;tincts were bountiful. It would have touched, warmed, and melted a philanthropi&s;t, to trace the marks of &s;uch genuine humanity along the &s;and. In one place, where I had ob&s;erved Mr. Ha&s;tings to &s;toop down, he had been at the trouble to repair with his hands the depredations of his feet, by rebuilding the little populated hil|lock, who&s;e &s;ides he had inadvertently da|maged; and at another part, where I had noticed him to make a large &s;tride, the bu&s;y creatures were gathered together in a kind of foraging party, which, but for that gene|rous &s;tride, he mu&s;t have exterminated. The feeling this gave penetrated my whole frame: but as I am of an ardent temper, I &s;hould have &s;et down &s;ome part of my emotion to tho&s;e con&s;titutional propen&s;ities, had not my recital, deare&s;t friend, of this little anec|dote to all orders of people, friends and ene|mies of the man, convinced me the feeling produced in all other minds was the &s;ame, and ari&s;ing from the &s;ame cau&s;e. The heart a&s;ked &s;pontaneou&s;ly, whether he who could thus act
<PB N="390" REF="409">towards a hillock of poor ants would trample under foot all the laws of humanity, and prove the &s;courge of his fellow-creatures, over who&s;e lives and properties he had equal power of do|ing good or evil?</Q> The heart thus que&s;tioning does not receive a reply &s;olely from the affec|tions, for rea&s;on her&s;elf gives in an an&s;wer. Rigorous as &s;he is in her judgments, &s;ome|times, where the &s;ympathi&s;ing affections are mo&s;t indulgent, &s;he he&s;itates not on this oc|ca&s;ion, to pronounce, that the per&s;on capable of &s;uch an un&s;een, uno&s;ten&s;ible action is con|&s;titutionally and habitually incapable of tho&s;e cruelties, with which he &s;tands impeached. I have here u&s;ed the word <HI>con&s;titutionally,</HI> as implicating a <HI>natural</HI> incapacity to act con|trary to the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the man, who&s;e forbearance to commit acts of barbarity may be con&s;idered rather as an in&s;tinct than a vir|tue; and I &s;hould think Warren Ha&s;tings might be found innocent of <HI>cruelties</HI> on the &s;imple argument of moral and phy&s;ical impo&s;|&s;ibility to act the part of a tyrant. Do not, at the &s;ame time, &s;uppo&s;e I am ignorant of the &s;neer with which certain profound criticks would, and will, treat the important inferences drawn from the&s;e premi&s;es. Tho&s;e who judge of the bias of the human mind only from <HI>great
<PB N="391" REF="410">events,</HI> will &s;mile at the conceit of honourably acquitting a State criminal on the evidence of his forbearing to cru&s;h a ne&s;t of in&s;ects, who&s;e death or pre&s;ervation, &s;ay they, weighs nothing in the &s;cale of human offences. In an&s;wer to all which, I &s;hall only beg to refer all &s;uch lovers of the &s;ublime to an hone&s;t &s;crutiny into their <HI>own hearts,</HI> where, if they have found, when alone, a di&s;po&s;ition to exerci&s;e undue authority over their birds, dome&s;tic animals, or even the flies that are &s;porting on their window, in &s;hort, to vex or hara&s;s any thing within their power, or under their protection, (I mean when they were even in that early &s;tage of life, when rea&s;on and natural tenderne&s;s, or natural cruelty, for I fear &s;uch things are began in their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> di&s;plays and exerci&s;es) they will have a clear conviction of the importance of tho&s;e apparent trifles in the judgment which they enable us to form of human hearts, and cha|racters, during the re&s;t of life: &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ince our vices like our virtues,
<Q>"Grow with our growth, and &s;trengthen with our &s;trength."</Q> And my ob&s;ervations have never yet been able to accommodate me with an exception, to this very broad general rule, viz. as a tender hearted youth (I &s;peak not of an infant) never, even by
<PB N="392" REF="411">the force of ill influence and example, makes a hard-hearted man, without fir&s;t &s;uffering many "compunctious vi&s;itings of nature," &s;o a cruel di&s;po&s;ition, manife&s;ted in our <HI>fir&s;t</HI> child|hood, is carried on to our <HI>&s;econd,</HI> changing its objects, but not its tyranny.</P>
<P>Of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, you are your|&s;elf, my invaluable friend, an example, in re|&s;pect to the fir&s;t part. I have attended the pro|gre&s;s of your being from its earlie&s;t dawn to its pre&s;ent full meridian. Every thing com|mitted to your care was the happier for it.&mdash; While yet in your babyhood, this natural be|nignity di&s;covered it&s;elf. Was a lamb to be dome&s;ticated? a chicken, &s;traying from its mother, or too weak to bear the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on, to be fo&s;tered? I remember well you were appointed the nur&s;e, and were to be entru&s;ted with its life or death. From that hour humanity marked you for her own: and you have honoured her adoption. The objects of your benevolence have of cour&s;e varied. To the lamb, which was to be of your hou&s;ehold, and to the chicken, which had wandered from its parent, &s;ucceeded the helple&s;s being, who had not wherewithal to make its bed, or find a &s;helter from the &s;torm. The monarch, Pa&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="393" REF="412">ripened into a monarch, Principle; and if in the cour&s;e of my long, long ab&s;ence from your loved &s;ociety, I was to hear that you had been impeached for numberle&s;s high crimes and mi&s;demeanours, of which the ba&s;is was <HI>inhuma|nity,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, that if your &s;en&s;es remain|ed, your kind-heartedne&s;s remained al&s;o; and that, although con&s;idering the imperfection of our being, you might be &s;educed into many frailties, weakne&s;&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c. you mu&s;t have been born again, and with diametrically a contra&s;ted di&s;po&s;ition, before you <HI>could</HI> be in|human. And on this principle I would an&s;wer for your innocence, or that of any man, with my life. Thus, in ca&s;es of tender-heartedne&s;s and tyranny,
<Q><L>"Trifles light as air,</L>
<L>"Are confirmations &s;trong</L>
<L>"As proofs of Holy Writ."</L></Q> Your mind will not &s;imply pardon, but reve|rence this digre&s;&s;ion, and return with me to Mr. Hope's villa.</P>
<P>To this beautiful place every re&s;pectable traveller may gain admittance. Since nothing but the living eye can do it ju&s;tice, I tru&s;t you will profit of this urbanity in the proprietor. In the mu&s;ic-room there is a pretty invention
<PB N="394" REF="413">for receiving the &s;ounds, without &s;eeing the in&s;truments, by which means you may &s;uppo&s;e them to be aerial; and, indeed, when this &s;a|loon is filled with beautiful women below, and harmonious in&s;truments above, as is often the ca&s;e on public nights, it requires very little enthu&s;ia&s;m, to feel, and exclaim, it is heavenly.</P>
<P>Four objects of very different kinds will excite the curio&s;ity of a &s;tranger in the neigh|bourhood and town of Haarlem, <HI>viz.</HI> the beauty of the flowers, the whitene&s;s of the linen, the almo&s;t cele&s;tial &s;ounds of the celebrated organ, and the fir&s;t &s;pecimens of Laurence Co&s;ter, in the art of printing.</P>
<P>In regard to the fir&s;t, a flori&s;t may &s;ee his favourite pa&s;&s;ion carried to the greate&s;t exce&s;s and perfection, no le&s;s a &s;um than 5000l. being given for a tulip root; and there is &s;uch a rivalry in the amateurs, that a per&s;on has been known to de&s;troy him&s;elf, on finding the tulip of a neighbour more beautifully &s;treaked or blown than his own.</P>
<P>The linen bleacheries of Haarlem are an object of real curio&s;ity. The &s;uperior whitene&s;s of the cambricks, threads, &amp;c. manufactured
<PB N="395" REF="414">here, has been attributed to the &s;limy water of the Meer, a va&s;t lake in this neighbourhood. However that be, it is certain, the pure&s;t lily, in their gardens, mu&s;t yield in colour to the linen that covers their tables. Indeed, through|out Holland, the article of beautiful linen, both at bed and board, is a luxury we &s;hall in vain look for in every other country. The mo&s;t ordinary inn, the cottages of the pea&s;antry, and even the cabins of the public boats, exhibit &s;uch &s;heets, towels, and table-cloths, that, if we connect with the&s;e, the exce&s;&s;ive cleanline&s;s of the floors, furniture, and kitchen uten&s;ils, we &s;hould not he&s;itate to pronounce in a <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> gleaning, that the Dutch were the neate&s;t peo|ple upon earth. I &s;ay, in an <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> gleaning, becau&s;e in going over the &s;ame ground, and its appurtenances, a &s;econd time, &s;ome things, &s;o much the rever&s;e of neatne&s;s, will be found, that the Dutch are brought upon the whole to a level with the mo&s;t dirty nation on the face of the globe: but as every man, who &s;tays long enough, will &s;ee, feelingly, this truth, I will pa&s;s over the particulars, except &s;uch &s;peci|mens as I gave in a former letter.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to printing, Stra&s;bourg di&s;putes with Haarlem the honour of that u&s;eful, and
<PB N="396" REF="415">beautiful, invention; but on comparing the pre|ten&s;ions, tho&s;e of Haarlem appear to be the be&s;t founded. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to remind you, that Co&s;ter, who is &s;aid to be the di&s;coverer of this noble art, hit upon it as he was walking in the wood adjoining the town. For want of other amu&s;ement, he cut the letters of his name on the bark of a tree, then &s;tampt them upon paper as a &s;eal, and that being &s;truck with the impre&s;&s;ion, he conceived he could render it more lively by engraving the &s;ame letters on lead. This al&s;o &s;ucceeding, he made a third e&s;&s;ay on pewter, and erected a printing-office in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>To Haarlem then we owe the birth of a man whom literature mu&s;t con&s;ider as its chief benefactor and parent. After &s;o many ages pa&s;&s;ed in the darkne&s;s of incommunicable igno|rance, the torch of &s;cience was then kindled. Genius, wi&s;dom, and the affections, had a wider range, and at once the book, and the light of knowledge was diffu&s;ed over the world.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;pecimens of the art being given by Co&s;ter, Etiennes &s;oon &s;pread it with im|provements through France; Manutius (the inventor of the Italic characters) through Italy,
<PB N="397" REF="416">and the Plantins through the Netherlands. Of Plantin's high degree of perfection in the art, the famous Poliglotte, of Antwerp, is a &s;ufficient proof.</P>
<P>Lawrence Co&s;ter is one of the very few to who&s;e talents public gratitude has erected a memorial. His &s;tatue is in the Botanic garden of this town. I have ju&s;t vi&s;ited the hou&s;e he inhabited, over the door of which I glean the following in&s;cription, engraved in golden let|ters: had they been of diamond, his fame de&s;erves them. <Q>Memoriae &s;acrum. Typographia, ars artium con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er|vatio: nunc primum inventa circa annum 1440.</Q> Every man of great talents or atchievements makes an infinite number of poets, good, bad, and indifferent. I have been &s;hewn a volume &s;acred to the inventor of printing, and truly I am able to glean only the follow|ing couplet, de&s;erving your peru&s;al:
<Q><L>"Illius arte artes omnes, linguaeque renatae</L>
<L>"Et &s;par&s;a in medi&acirc; lux nova nocte &s;uit."</L></Q></P>
<P>The Catholic religion is tolerated here, and its votaries are &s;o numerous, that each Catho|lic family is obliged to put on the door of
<PB N="398" REF="417">the hou&s;e, the letter C. that the mini&s;ters of the reformed church, in making their vi&s;its <HI>ex of|ficio,</HI> &s;hould know their own flocks, and not &s;tray into another man's fold.</P>
<P>Haarlem Meer is as dreary a body of water as can well be looked on; it is not always pa&s;&s;ed without hazard: of which one might glean numberle&s;s in&s;tances. Among&s;t others that which follows.</P>
<P>The King of Bohemia having been dethroned, and driven out of the palatinate by the Empe|ror, took &s;anctuary in Holland. He left Haar|lem, &s;ays the anecdote, towards evening, in the month of December. The night proved very dark, and the lake tempe&s;tuous, when a boat falling foul of that in which he was &s;ailing, &s;unk it directly. The King &s;aved him&s;elf by &s;wimming; but his elde&s;t &s;on, who had been the companion and &s;olace of his exile, was drowned. It is added, that the la&s;t words of the young prince, were&mdash;<Q>Ah! &s;ave me, dear father, &s;ave your &s;on:</Q> and that tho&s;e of the King, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, almo&s;t at the moment of his death, were a repetition of this pathetic, but unavailing reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="418">A man, &s;ays Carter, can hardly go through a &s;treet of Haarlem, without &s;eeing &s;ome ob|jects that remind him of the hi&s;tory of the country. This is a truth which few travellers have allowed them&s;elves time to be acquainted with, as Haarlem is generally looked upon to be a mere thoroughfare to Am&s;terdam, which is complimented with notice ju&s;t in the degree that this town is &s;lighted.</P>
<P>The ruins of the old ca&s;tle here, wherein the burghers be&s;ieged the Lord of the place for his tyranny, are &s;till to be &s;een. This &s;iege would have co&s;t him his life, if his lady had not capitulated to &s;urrender, on condition that &s;he &s;hould be allowed to bring out of the ca&s;tle as much of the valuable goods as &s;he could carry on her back. This article being agreed to, &s;he took her hu&s;band on her &s;houlders, pre&s;erving him in this manner from their fury, and left the place to their mercy; which by the bye they were well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew, on account of the plea&s;ant device which had &s;aved her lord, and put the enemy into a good humour.</P>
<P>There was a notable wife for you. Perhaps, wicked wits, the &s;landerers of the lovely &s;ex,
<PB N="400" REF="419">who, as Pope &s;ays, "libel all the fair," would in&s;inuate that many of our modern married dames would content them&s;elves with carrying out their jewel box, and leave their hu&s;bands behind them. But wicked wits may a&s;&s;ert what they plea&s;e; I am &s;o far from a&s;&s;i&s;ting their &s;candal, that I can never &s;u&s;pect this to happen, unle&s;s in the general hurry of &s;ecuring No. 1, No. 2 &s;hould be forgotten: as who can an&s;wer for the effects of fear upon the memory; and at &s;uch a time too, when you know the fir&s;t law of nature pre&s;&s;es for obedi|ence. No! depend on it, &s;hould a hu&s;band be overlooked in a lady's treaty of &s;afety, it could only proceed from a little inadvertence, or a very laudable de&s;ign, to leave behind what was not worth carrying away. Such opportunities, you know, do not happen often:
<Q><L>"There is a tide in the affairs of women,</L>

<P>But Haarlem, it &s;eems, was at all times po|pular for its gallant females. Hi&s;torians men|tion almo&s;t as many heroines as heroes, who defended the town in the memorable fiege of 1573. Strada tells us, that, making u&s;e of the
<PB N="401" REF="420">invention peculiar to them, in the <HI>moment critique,</HI> they conver&s;ed with the Prince of Orange by pigeons as couriers, but which, be|ing di&s;covered, by one of them &s;ettling upon a tent of the Spani&s;h camp, the enemy &s;hot all the&s;e winged expre&s;&s;es about the town, and put an end to the winged intercour&s;e. During the &s;iege of this ca&s;tle, the &s;oldiers who fought for it within, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to receive any &s;uccours from without, were compelled at la&s;t to &s;urrender, after being reduced to eat leather, gra&s;s, and every other thing that could prevent them from either being &s;tarved or vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>More than three centuries back, there has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, a tradition, which has the &s;uffrage of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive hi&s;torians, but of which the modern reader may believe as much as he plea&s;es, that a mermaid was ca&s;t a&s;hore by a &s;torm near this town, and was brought to eat bread and milk, and to &s;pin, and in &s;hort to become a very u&s;eful &s;ervant in the hou&s;e where &s;he was nouri&s;hed. It is &s;aid &s;he would fre|quently pull off her clothes without many re|&s;erves, as to where or before whom &s;he <HI>unmade her toilette,</HI> and run towards the water, her old element, but that &s;he would return to her new one, after having taken a &s;wim for an hour or two and
<PB N="402" REF="421">&s;een what her friends were about at the bottom of Haarlem Lake. By way, however, of keeping this aquatic dam&s;el, and her biographers, in countenance, authors mention a male of the &s;ame &s;pecies to have been taken in England about the &s;ame time. But then this young gentle|man was by no means of &s;o gracious a di&s;po|&s;ition as the young lady, being very &s;ulky, feeding only on fi&s;h&mdash;"a mo&s;t &s;curvy mon&s;ter," as Trinculo &s;ays, &s;o his keeper finding him <HI>intractable,</HI> left him to his own &s;ullen de|vices, upon which he &s;tole off again to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This &s;tory is told with great gravity, aye, and to this hour with great gravity be|lieved too, by the good Haarlemites.&mdash;But, <Q>by this good light, he mu&s;t be a very &s;hallow, a very credulous mon&s;ter,</Q> that be|lieves it, without &s;ome grains of allowance.</P>
<P>Yet this is nothing, my dear friend, either in point of marvel or of evidence, to a &s;tory that prevails in Holland, re&s;pecting a Counte&s;s of Hennenberg, daughter of Florence the IVth, one of the ancient Counts of Zealand. This curious event, which has the antiquity and credit of more than five hundred years upon
<PB N="403" REF="422">it, happened at a little village about four miles from the Hague.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s meeting one day a woman with twins in her arms, upbraided her as un|cha&s;te, becau&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, people may &s;ay what they plea&s;e, but I &s;hall never be brought to believe a woman can have two children at once by one man. Hereupon the counte&s;s re|fu&s;ed her charity; when the good woman hearing her&s;elf not only denied the alms &s;he &s;olicited, but reproached at the &s;ame time for incontinency, wi&s;hed that her lady&s;hip, who was then pregnant, might have as many chil|dren as there were days in the year. This malediction was fulfilled upon the uncharitable Margaret, who was delivered exactly of three hundred and &s;ixty-five children, who were all baptized by Guido, &s;uffragan of Utrecht. All the males were named John; and all the fe|males Elizabeth; and to make the prophecy tell better, it is roundly a&s;&s;erted, that all died the &s;ame day, with their mother. Now, that tho&s;e who are of little faith, may be put into the way of enlarging it, we are informed, that one of the&s;e children is &s;till to be &s;een in the Mu&s;aeum Regium, at Copenhagen, where the curious, who are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;earch into this
<PB N="404" REF="423">prodigy, may &s;atisfy them&s;elves, whether it be true or fal&s;e; and as curio&s;ity is &s;el|dom any thing more than another name for <HI>bu&s;y idlene&s;s,</HI> I cannot but think a journey of this kind to the full as laudable as that which carries a man to Grand Cairo, to mea&s;ure a pyramid, or to any other modern re&s;ort of tra|vellers on modern motives.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t tell you, Era&s;mus relates, and &s;eems to give credence to this event: &s;o do four other authors of di&s;tinction. In the village church there is a board fixed to the wall, with a long in&s;cription, giving an ac|count of the whole matter, and al&s;o the two bra&s;s ba&s;ons, in which the children were bap|tized with this di&s;tich under them:
<Q><L>En tibi mon&s;tro&s;um nimis et memorabile factum,</L>
<L>Quale nec a mundi conditione datum.</L></Q></P>
<P>The tradition however &s;erves a moral pur|po&s;e; for the event being con&s;idered by the common people e&s;pecially, as a judgment upon pride, uncharitablene&s;s, and contempt of the poor, I am told there has not been known a go&s;&s;ip, male or female, who has <HI>&s;aid</HI> a &s;candalous thing of a neighbour the&s;e hundred years,
<PB N="405" REF="424">though the pari&s;h regi&s;ter gives a yearly li&s;t of births, exceeding the marriages in a <HI>ratio</HI> of five to one.</P>
<P>After all, I allow the arguments of an ad|vocate for this mon&s;trous birth, when he &s;ays, prodigies do &s;ometimes happen: and that an eminent modern writer is wrong is a&s;&s;erting ab&s;olutely, <HI>Hunc partum po&s;t aliquot &s;ecula confictum, ad fabulas pertinere aniles, placiti&s;que phy&s;icorum repugnare.</HI> The origin of the pre&s;ent royal family of Great Britain from the Dukes of Bavaria and Saxony is remarkable enough: and its verity is in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>Germentrude, Counte&s;s of Altorf, in Swabia, having accu&s;ed a poor woman of adultery, and cau&s;ed her to be puni&s;hed for having twelve children at a birth, was &s;oon after delivered of twelve &s;ons her&s;elf: Her hu&s;band, Count I&s;enberg, being then ab&s;ent, to avoid the &s;ame &s;candal, &s;he ordered the midwi&s;e to carry out of the hou&s;e eleven, and put them to death: The Count, however, happening to come home at that in&s;tant, a&s;ked the midwife what &s;he had in her apron; and &s;he an&s;wered <HI>woelpen,</HI> that is, puppies, or <HI>whelps.</HI> Hereupon, in&s;i&s;ting to &s;ee them, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the whole affair, and
<PB N="406" REF="425">the Count, in con&s;equence, enjoining &s;ecrecy, had them put out to nur&s;e. Six years after he invited mo&s;t of his own and his wife's relations to a banquet, and in the mid&s;t of their jollity, brought out his eleven &s;ons all dre&s;&s;ed alike. The Counte&s;s owned her fault, and the Count was in too good an humour not to forgive her, but in remembrance of this &s;ingular pre&s;erva|tion he ordered the children to be called <HI>Guelphs.</HI> From the elde&s;t of the&s;e de&s;cended Henry Guelph, Count of Altorf, whom the Emperor, Conrad II. afterwards made Duke of Bavaria.</P>
<P>I ju&s;t now recollect the well-atte&s;ted account of a third &s;ea-mon&s;ter, which appeared on the coa&s;t of Martinico, in the year 1671, and which may be con&s;idered as a very good match for the Haarlem Mermaid. He had the figure of a man from the head to the wai&s;t, a good &s;hape, large eyes and no&s;e, a full face, and long hair, which flowed over his &s;houlders, with a very good complexion. The lower parts re&s;embled tho&s;e of a fi&s;h. He &s;hewed him&s;elf above the waves, for the fir&s;t time, about an hour before &s;un&s;et, and &s;wam to &s;hore. He then walked along the beach, and did not go again into the water till night fall. Tho&s;e who di&s;|covered him,
<PB N="407" REF="426">a&s;&s;ert, that he &s;eemed to be ex|tremely gentle, and &s;tood looking at them for &s;ome time, without any &s;igns of apprehen&s;ion as might have been expected. Another of the &s;ame kind appeared, the &s;ame year, near Belle-i&s;le.</P>
<P>But enough of mon&s;ters; the bell-boat in|forms me, the &s;chuyts are &s;etting off for Am|&s;terdam, and were it not &s;o, it is time to bring this long Letter to a conclu&s;ion, and bid you very affectionately Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Am&s;terdam.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT has but ju&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to me, that I have &s;ent you now more than two large volumes of letters, principally without dates. This would certainly be a mortal offence in commercial corre&s;pondence, but I do not, by any means, think it unpardonable in an inter|cour&s;e, &s;uch as ours.</P>
<P>You know the <HI>places</HI> at which I am re&s;ident. The known di&s;tance of the&s;e, and the no le&s;s known progre&s;s of the po&s;ts and mails, allow|ing for <HI>"moving</HI> accidents by flood and field," are in them&s;elves an explanation of dates, as to weeks and months, and as to the <HI>day</HI> of the week, or the hour of the day, on which I begin to write, it is as little material, as if I was to &s;end you a critical account of the time I take in writing my letter by a &s;top watch. Be&s;ides all this whenever I &s;it down to addre&s;s a friend, my heart is &s;o full of affection, and throbs &s;o &s;trongly to pour forth its effu&s;ions,
<PB N="409" REF="428">with all the ardour and rapidity of Nature, that, in the out&s;et, I cannot &s;top to &s;ettle the chrono|logy of my corre&s;pondence, and really as often forget the day of the month, as I remember it, and even when the latter happens to be the ca&s;e, there is &s;o little of mere mechanical author&s;hip in my letters to you, that it is fre|quently a wonder that I allow my&s;elf time to tell you, by any other way than the &s;ubjects of the letter, where I am; and I dare &s;ay, it may have happened that you have received &s;ome of my communications without any other intelli|gence whence they came, than you have been able to <HI>glean</HI> from the marter treated of.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I have always been di&s;gu&s;ted with your over-exact journal travellers, the half of who&s;e books are taken up with the very in|tere&s;ting news of their day's journey. At &s;ix o'clock, in very fine or very foul weather, they left England. A &s;weet or a &s;our ride down to Harwich or Dover; a very &s;ick and &s;orry pa&s;|&s;age over the water; very hungry on getting to the inn; are heartily, or could not touch a mor&s;el; reached the &s;hore exactly at three quarters and three &s;econds after four in the evening; &s;at down to dinner ju&s;t as the clock had given warning to &s;trike &s;ix; po&s;t-hor&s;es
<PB N="410" REF="429">were ordered preci&s;ely at &s;even, but did not come to the door till thirty-two minutes, five &s;econds, and one-fourth of a moment, before eight; got to the next &s;tage at half-pa&s;t eleven; hurried &s;upper, which came on at twelve, and was over before half after; people &s;aucy; victuals bad; wor&s;e dre&s;&s;ed; bills high; beds execrable; and &s;at down to write the&s;e ob&s;er|vations on the manners and cu&s;toms, as &s;oon as I reached my chamber, betwixt &s;leeping and waking; &s;hall put this into the po&s;t-office to go by the returning mail; and will <HI>continue</HI> to give you an account of every thing I hear and &s;ee as I go along.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Helveot&s;luice.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Calais, Sept.</HI> 18, 179&mdash;2, 3, 4.</L>
<L>Sixteen minutes, 2 &s;econds pa&s;t 1, P. M.</L></Q>
<P>Here is, to be &s;ure, a little exaggeration, into which the &s;pirit of burle&s;que imitation naturally hurries one; but the colouring is not very &s;trong; and I have a thou&s;and times been made &s;ick, with the like nau&s;eating &s;crupulo&s;ity. What is it better than the tedious logbook of a land&s;man, in which every thing of no mo|ment is recorded, and all that affects, intere&s;ts, touches, or informs, is omitted!</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="430">Very proper certainly for the counting-hou&s;e, and the courts of ju&s;tice, and for all the litera|ture of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum.</HI> But what is it to my private friends, (&s;uppo&s;ing them &s;atisfied that I am not in want of the&s;e daily comforts) or what is it to the public at large, whether I got into the coach at &s;ix, or at twelve; reached the boat in the morning, or in the evening; &s;at down to dinner at &s;even or eight; or began to write a journal about nothing at one hour or at ano|ther? Away with &s;uch minute chronologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I ob&s;erve at lei&s;ure, and write in ha&s;te&mdash;I glean, ear by ear, what lies in my path, or on either &s;ide, I &s;toop with patient diligence, and gather whatever I think may give plea&s;ure or information to my bo&s;om's friend. The intervals of weeks and months, it is true, often &s;eparate one letter from ano|ther; but all that time I am a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, though &s;ilently, proceeding; and while (either from the richer &s;heaves of <HI>another,</HI> I &s;elect what is mo&s;t valuable, from the ma&s;s of what appears to me of no account, or to my <HI>own,</HI> I give arrange|ment and &s;pirit) I am &s;o occupied I ap|pear to be in a manner conver&s;ing, with you in particular, and in general with all I love and have left behind. Every particular friend, in|deed,
<PB N="412" REF="431">has his character of mind and plea&s;ure di&s;tinct and appropriate. In the &s;ecret of his habits, I feel frequently gratifying them as I go on. Such as delight in the repo&s;e of &s;olitude, and &s;uch as appreciate the clamour of the world take their turn in my thoughts, as I paint the &s;cenes and places, (or lay up mate|rials for them in my note-book), which dif|ferently affect them. Does Nature &s;pread her blooms before me, as I pa&s;s or &s;ojourn in a far country&mdash;Is the eye regaled by pro&s;pects, or the ear by melodies, before un&s;een and un|heard&mdash;I &s;oftly whi&s;per to my&s;elf, as I take out my tablets, this is imagery, which will exactly &s;uit the fancy of one friend. Are my affec|tions a&s;&s;ailed by a touch of genuine nature as &s;he works in the human brea&s;t&mdash;I &s;trike my pen&s;ive bo&s;om, and &s;ay, this is a Gleaning that will reach the heart of another. Is my &s;oul agitated by the &s;ublime, or torn by the tender exhibitions of finely imitated nature on a foreign theatre&mdash;How, exclaim I, will a third friend &s;ympathize with <HI>this</HI> Gleaning.&mdash;In a word, all the time (though months in|tervene) that I am going over the country, or the town, "with pen&s;ive &s;teps and &s;low," I am holding "communion high and dear, with tho&s;e whom no ab&s;ence can obliterte;
<PB N="423" REF="432">nor, even, any e&s;trangements can make me think of without the &s;igh of an ab&s;ent friend, who cannot but remember they have afforded him many a delightful conver&s;ation, and many a bli&s;sful idea &s;ince they parted." And though, perhaps, it is a parting to meet no more&mdash;the memory
<Q><L>"That &s;uch things were,</L>
<L>"And were mo&s;t precious to me, is bli&s;aful &s;till.</L></Q></P>
<P>But &s;ee how my heart has run away with my hand. I &s;et out &s;imply with an apology, or rather ju&s;tification for neglect of dates&mdash; but
<Q><L>"With thee conver&s;ing, I forget all time,</L>
<L>"All &s;ea&s;ons, and their change."</L></Q> I forget that I am writing from one of the mo&s;t clamorous cities in the whole world; and that, at this very moment, cars, coaches, wheel|barrows, and their more noi&s;y attendants, are pa&s;&s;ing by the window at which I write; yet, &s;o veritable is every word of what I have hitherto &s;et in this letter, &s;o &s;uperior is the rapid progre&s;s of animating nature, to all the mechanical feelings, and impediments of art, that I have &s;carcely heard the din. Wonder not, therefore, that I overlook dates. I over|look in the flow of my affections, much more nece&s;&s;ary things. With &s;uch energy is my
<PB N="414" REF="433">heart filled, and &s;o powerfully does it ha&s;ten to give up its effu&s;ions, when once the pen is in my hand, that when that pen, unable to keep pace with the impetuo&s;ity of my affec|tions, grows weary, or is worn out, with marking them upon paper, I do not believe, (though I have never tried), I could bring my&s;elf to the mechani&s;m of tearing my&s;elf from you, to look for another, or mend that my ardour has tired, on any con&s;ideration. And this mu&s;t account to you for the illegibility of mo&s;t part of my corre&s;pondence. I mention this not &s;o much in the way of excu&s;e for bad writing, as to exemplify the motives of it, which are really tho&s;e of &s;incere affection. For I repeat to you, that though I glean my materials of corre&s;pondence deliberately, I write at the fulle&s;t &s;peed of the heart, when tho&s;e materials are to be put down, and I always know the degree of love I bear a per&s;on, by the general handwriting of the letter I am about to tran&s;mit. Take then the&s;e almo&s;t undecypherable hieroglyphics, as &s;o many in&s;tances of the energy and vivid powers of my friend&s;hip. If I loved you le&s;s, you &s;hould have better writing. Every page &s;hould carry all the formal ceremonies of polite indiffer|ence, all the freezing regularities of a cor|re&s;pondence
<PB N="415" REF="434">that gives and receives letter for letter: and the debt of our epi&s;tolary inter|cour&s;e &s;hould be &s;ettled with the preci&s;ion, and with the apathy of a &s;teward in the balance, and bu&s;ine&s;s of pounds, &s;hillings, and pence, with the accur&aacute;cy (mind I &s;peak of a <HI>faithful</HI> &s;teward) of Cocker's Arithmetic. Nay, every &s;yllable &s;hould be as fair to your eyes, and as cold to your heart as &s;now. Methinks I hear you exclaim, ah, continue to give me what the heart dictates, though you mark to me its ge|nuine movements, with a &s;kewer or a pot|hook! Well, be it &s;o; for after the above hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of my &s;crawlings, I know you would not forgive me were I to check the "genial current of the &s;oul," by the chilling operation of mending a pen, though I thereby might &s;end you a letter, (for I really can write legibly though you may not think it) fairer than copper-plate.</P>
<P>So now for Am&s;terdam. But having brought my&s;elf to a breathing place, and being too late for this day's po&s;t, I will, when I continue my letter, &s;it down with a new pen; for this now in my hand, has faultered and tripped under my work, like a jaded hor&s;e, panting to reach its goal, but almo&s;t de&s;pairing to do &s;o, and
<PB N="416" REF="435">ju&s;t ready to die upon the cour&s;e. With un|fatigued regard, a while, Adieu.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;atisfied my&s;elf that I may con|tinue to enjoy the perfect freedom of obeying the motions of my own mind rather than be obliged to con&s;train it to the mercantile rules of letter-writing, I proceed to give you my Gleanings of Am&s;terdam, of that magni|ficent and opulent city, which, lifting its head above the waters, a&s;&s;erts its preten&s;ions to a rank in the map of the world, with what Paris once was, and what London has the triumph to be at this moment. Suffer me to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence tho&s;e &s;trong &s;mells, which certainly take a traveller by the no&s;e, the in&s;tant he enters the gates, and which do not let go their hold till he is &s;ea&s;oned to the &s;cent. Peace to their contagious canals, and mantling pools. Numberle&s;s are the multitudes that prefer the&s;e, from habit and from gain, to the Citron Groves of Mexico, and the Spice I&s;lands of the Orient.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam, indeed, is, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, an a&s;toni&s;hing city, and as a reflecting man walks along, he may well exclaim, Is it credible that this huge pile of buildings with
<PB N="417" REF="436">all its bu&s;y inhabitants, &s;hould have been &s;up|ported for &s;o many hundred years on a fore&s;t &s;tanding in a river; that in the neighbourhood of the roaring ocean, that river &s;hould by the aid of human indu&s;try command that ocean to know its bound? Even though, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the ocean was robbed of its ancient rights, to form the river and to rear the city, which re&s;ts upon it,
<Q>"A new creation re&s;cu'd from his reign."</Q></P>
<P>On recollection, this image has before &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf to me, and been communicated to you in a former letter; but it occurs to me at almo&s;t every view I take; and though, like you, my friend, and every per&s;on of reading, the &s;treets, buildings, bu&s;ine&s;s, and intere&s;ts of this mighty ma&s;s of wood and water, have been familiar to me, ever &s;ince I became a traveller, even in books, and though I have actually compared the city it&s;elf with the various de&s;criptions of it, it is the only place I ever read about and vi&s;ited, of which the impre&s;&s;ions of a&s;toni&s;hment remain unimpaired; not &s;o much on account of its wealth, or beauty, but for its origin, progre&s;s, and &s;ituation. Con&s;ider what it is for millions of living things, to have exi&s;ted for centuries in, as it were, one
<PB N="418" REF="437">immen&s;e &s;hip of merchandize! to which an hundred fore&s;ts mu&s;t have contributed the timber, and miriads of hands the workman|&s;hip!&mdash;Shops, hou&s;es, temples, &amp;c. in an abundance, that &s;eems to a&s;k the mo&s;t &s;olid foundations on the drie&s;t hills, or harde&s;t rocks, &s;u&s;tained by huge planks, which are driven into a trembling bog! And in a country, where at the time of erecting the city, the <HI>car|riage</HI> of materials was more difficult to be pro|cured, than the materials them&s;elves? The Hotel de Ville it&s;elf, repo&s;es on more than thirty thou&s;and &s;takes, or rather trees. A va&s;t ark at anchor! containing almo&s;t countle&s;s beings, the greater part of which are engaged in the mo&s;t laborious and heavy employments! Is the architecture of Am&s;terdam ma&s;&s;ive? are the edifices rude, clum&s;y, and inelegant? are the ornaments awkward, and without ta&s;te? Admitted. But, what does this prove? No|thing more than that the grand de&s;ign was to build a warehou&s;e for the world; of which the original proprietors did not &s;o much con&s;ider decoration as u&s;e. A light, airy city, might, perhaps, have been &s;upported with all its fea|thered, dancing inhabitants, on the twigs of tho&s;e enormous trees, which were to &s;u&s;tain this va&s;t fabric of bu&s;ine&s;s! but would &s;uch
<PB N="419" REF="438">an airy city have an&s;wered the &s;olid purpo&s;es for which that &s;torehou&s;e of the world was at fir&s;t con&s;tructed? No. And even could it have been rai&s;ed to its pre&s;ent &s;ize, on &s;lighter prin|ciples, the trea&s;uries of "either Ind," which now re&s;t &s;afe and dry, would tumble in the water, and the airy city, with all its airy people, peri&s;h along with them, and
<Q>"Leave <HI>but</HI> a wreck <HI>behind."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet this great mart of commerce is not without its votaries, and man&s;ions, of the ele|gant arts. It boa&s;ts a theatre con&s;tructed and conducted on far more polite and liberal prin|ciples than any play-hou&s;e more flouri&s;hing in our &s;tage-&s;truck Britain. It is &s;upported by the voluntary contribution of, comparatively, a few individuals, for the benefit of the public; that is to &s;ay, every &s;ub&s;criber is entitled to &s;uch a number of tickets as gives him the power to amu&s;e <HI>many</HI> of his friends, and thus the hou&s;e is filled every evening by friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity, with as brilliant and numerous an audience as I ever &s;aw in any part of the world. Every per&s;on is at full liberty to take the range of the hou&s;e, which is large and beau|tiful. Travellers have but to &s;end, announcing their names and country, and tickets will be
<PB N="420" REF="439">pre&s;ented to them, in proportion to the party that &s;olicits.</P>
<P>Delightful England&mdash;thou to whom I owe the balancing joys of a thou&s;and &s;orrows, and of whom I would, and do &s;peak with grateful and ju&s;t eulogy, pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, whenever, and wherever, I can; put not the "frontlet on," if I thus dare to do ju&s;tice to other peo|ple, whether in a land of friends or foes, of trade or elegance. And thou, John Bull, for who&s;e rough hone&s;ty and bounty I have as great a reverence as any of thy mo&s;t &s;turdy a&s;&s;ociates, &s;purn not my book, which only <Q>"Laughs where it mu&s;t, and is candid where it can."</Q> Confe&s;s then that though, on a proper occa|&s;ion, thou woulde&s;t give thy box ticket to the &s;tranger that is within thy gates, and mount thy&s;elf to the one &s;hilling gallery, &s;o aba&s;ing thy&s;elf, that thou maye&s;t be exalted; confe&s;s that the&s;e Dutch neighbours of thine, living in Am&s;terdam, have an in&s;titution, the adop|tion of which would not at all di&s;grace thy beloved London: the more e&s;pecially, as thou maye&s;t have heard, and art to be informed if thou ha&s;t not, that charity, as well as plea&s;ure and genero&s;ity, attends on this theatre. The magi&s;trates receive the money, defray the
<PB N="421" REF="440">charges, and pay the actors very &s;ufficient &s;a|laries. The re&s;idue is applied to the poor, and to the &s;upport of the different ho&s;pitals, among&s;t which latter is one &s;acred to all poor <HI>travellers,</HI> without di&s;tinction, who are lodged, nur&s;ed, and entertained for three nights.</P>
<P>If one could &s;ee all that was under Am&s;ter|dam, &s;ays Carter, a greater fore&s;t could hardly be found on the face of the earth. Old Era&s;|mus facetiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, on his fir&s;t vi&s;it to this place, that he was arrived in a city, the inhabitants of which lived upon the tops of trees; and another wag tells us, that Am&s;ter|dam, like Venice, has wooden legs.</P>
<P>But the <HI>public lions</HI> of this mighty city, of fore&s;t-growth, <HI>viz.</HI> the churches, &s;yna|gogues, ho&s;pitals, ga&s;thou&s;es, dolhou&s;es, ra&s;p|hou&s;es, and &s;pin-hou&s;es; that is to &s;ay, recep|tacles for the &s;ick, in&s;ane, wild, or wicked, I &s;hall &s;pare you the repetition of, as your me|mory mu&s;t be full of them, in tours upon tours, and travels upon travels. But a few particulars that lie more out of the beaten tract of ob&s;ervation, I will glean for you next po&s;t. <HI>En attendant,</HI> may your felicity be pro|portioned to your merit; and then&mdash;how happy will you be!</P>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved of this place, that none of the inhabitants are idle. This is &s;o true, that an indolent per&s;on might traver&s;e the city in all its parts without finding a compa|nion. He would thus be driven, by the very nature and mi&s;carriage of his &s;earch, into ac|tion him&s;elf. Nay, he would &s;ee every eye &s;o bu&s;y, every foot &s;o hard at work, and every head <HI>&s;eem</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o full, that, forgetting his natural torpidity, or remembering it with re|proach, he would catch the &s;pirit of objects before him, and feel that it is at lea&s;t as good and natural for man to be in motion as at re&s;t. The city of Am&s;terdam is a hive where all the inhabitants are collecting honey from one end of the year to the other, (excepting only the repo&s;e of every &s;eventh day) and where a drone dares not &s;hew his head. If, in &s;o large a Re|public, large with re&s;pect to its population, as this &s;ingle city is computed at 300,000 per|&s;ons, there &s;hould be any unworthy members of that de&s;cription, they are con&s;trained to lurk
<PB N="423" REF="442">in holes and corners, indulging their dormou&s;e di&s;po&s;itions apart from the &s;cenes of almo&s;t univer&s;al indu&s;try, where wealthy &s;tores are ac|cumulating by ince&s;&s;ant attention, and where an unwhole&s;ome &s;oil is &s;o meliorated by the exerci&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch accumulation, that the air and water, which would almo&s;t &s;uffocate a lazy fi&s;h, is found very little to invade the powers of health: for it is more an ill name than a fact, that the pre&s;idents of this city are the victims of avarice, which leads them to dig for gold in a &s;oil that produces it, amid&s;t the dro&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es. The florid vigour, which glows in the cheeks, and braces the limbs of the inhabitants of other places in Holland, Rotterdam, and the Brielle, more e&s;pecially, is not, certainly, &s;een &s;o commonly in the Am&s;ter|damians, but there is good general health among&s;t them; and therefore, as there is no de|nying the atmo&s;phere is in it&s;elf "a &s;oul and pe&s;tilent congregation of vapours," it is ma|nife&s;t that indu&s;try &s;upplies what nature has refu&s;ed&mdash;no &s;mall motive to labour diligently in one's calling this. In like manner, it is no le&s;s true, that &s;tagnant indolence will create a di&s;temper, fatal to the &s;pirits, the &s;trength, and the under&s;tanding, where nature has been the mo&s;t prodigal of her bounties, and every
<PB N="424" REF="443">day convinces us, that, as at Am&s;terdam, while men grow rich, healthy, and happy, amid&s;t the toils of life in the mo&s;t noxious &s;ituation, tho&s;e who neither toil nor &s;pin, and who, cur&s;ed with the inverted ble&s;&s;ing of an unwieldy fortune, and with either the apathy or the pa&s;&s;ions, which too often are in the train of hereditary wealth, con&s;ume their beings in u&s;e|le&s;s inaction, and wa&s;te them&s;elves by indul|gence, though they breathe in the pure&s;t air, and &s;lumber on beds the &s;ofte&s;t luxury has pre|pared, amid&s;t flowers and fragrance:
<Q>"Die of a ro&s;e in aromatic pain;"</Q> Or live only to prove, that exerci&s;e alone can give it a whole&s;ome perfume.</P>
<P>Thus, if labour is its own reward, indolence is its own proper puni&s;hment, according to the maxim of the ancients, "that acute (which to the indu&s;trious are rare) di&s;ea&s;es are from heaven, and chronic from our&s;elves;" and in the whole circle of human trui&s;ms, there is not one, my dear friend, more incontrover|tible than this, that almo&s;t every occupation, however inconvenient, or formidable, is happier and &s;afer than a life of &s;loth. Diligence, &s;ays Addi&s;on, makes more la&s;ting acqui&s;itions than
<PB N="425" REF="444">walour, and &s;loth has ruined more nations than the &s;word.</P>
<P>It would have diverted you extremely to have been an eye-witne&s;s to my progre&s;s through the &s;treets of Am&s;terdam: any indif|ferent &s;pectator, indeed, unacquainted with my habits of &s;auntering, at &s;ome moments, and quickening my pace, almo&s;t into a run, at others, would have imputed my irregular motions and pau&s;es to a di&s;po&s;ition equally partaking the vice of idlene&s;s, and the virtue of in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>I &s;allied forth on a fair morning, with gleaning de&s;igns, to make a tour of the town. Convinced by experience, that at almo&s;t every &s;tep a diligent man, who will take time to look about him, may find &s;omething to carry to his &s;heaf, I &s;topped almo&s;t at every &s;hop, looked into every face as long as it remained in view; and if by good luck I could catch a knot of men of bu&s;ine&s;s, gathered together upon a bridge, by the fide of a quay, or at a &s;hop-door, I broke &s;hort my own &s;tep, and &s;tood fixed as a &s;etting dog, while they &s;taid. If in any of the party I &s;aw a face I was inte|re&s;ted about more than the re&s;t, that I fol|lowed,
<PB N="426" REF="445">and &s;tuck to it, till it was lo&s;t in the coffee-hou&s;es, or at the exchange. The&s;e ge|neral re&s;orts I often entered, and there lo&s;t <HI>my&s;elf</HI> in the croud of various affairs and na|tions: but even here, when it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;ingle out a particular object, who&s;e di&s;cour&s;e, manner, or appearance were in&s;tructive or in|tere&s;ting, I &s;topped to glean him. In any other city of the world, perhaps, this would have been noted as ridiculous, at lea&s;t &s;ingular. A polite mob would have &s;et it down as an offence, and corrected it as impertinence; as, in effect, though not in de&s;ign, it might be, but at Am&s;terdam, either becau&s;e an apparent|ly &s;aucy fellow, who has nothing better to do, was deemed too in&s;ignificant for remark; or be|cau&s;e the people were really too &s;eriou&s;ly en|gaged in their own bu&s;ine&s;s, to attend to another man's idlene&s;s, they never noticed me. They took their no&s;es almo&s;t out of my ears, where I had (to come within <HI>gleaning</HI> di&s;tance) planted them, the hurried off on the full trot to their different concerns. I trod upon a merchant's toes, and by my anxious look, &s;uppo&s;ing he had return|ed the compliment with intere&s;t, he took off his hat, begged my pardon, and bu&s;tled away. With re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, it was uniform, with a &s;ingle exception. During two
<PB N="427" REF="446">hours I &s;tening, if for every repetition of the words ducat, guilder, and &s;tiver, that &s;truck my ear, I could have gathered in a tax of a doit (half a farthing) on each, I might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter to liquidate the national debt. But the exception took quite another turn: I was &s;etting a couple of mer|chants, in the heat of conver&s;ation, with a knot of the &s;ons of I&s;rael, (one of whom was warmly defending the price that he demanded for his commodity) I will not give you the money you a&s;k: it would be throwing it into one of the canals, and I never threw away a &s;tiver &s;ince I came into the world, and hope I &s;hall not while I live in it. The Jew per&s;i&s;ted in his price, and the merchant left him to the other chapman. A very poor and &s;ick looking creature, who had all the time been leaning (for &s;upport more than idlene&s;s) again&s;t one of the pillars of the exchange, and who had heard this la&s;t unpromi&s;ing &s;entence for a man that de&s;igned to a&s;k a merchant to give away his money, now &s;tepped forward, and took hold of the &s;kirt of the merchant's coat; when the following dialogue literally, and, as near as tran&s;lation allows, unornamentedly pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>

</SP>
<P>The petitioner took the &s;ack, and ran one way: the merchant another, and, though ap|parently always active, with more than wonted activity, for never was a point more obvious than that the pace of the fir&s;t was quickened by the lively impre&s;&s;ions of grateful joy, and of the la&s;t by happy genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Le&s;t, however, tho&s;e who feel within them|&s;elves a promptitude, for certain rea&s;ons, to di&s;|believe there is &s;uch a thing, in the world, as happy genero&s;ity, and lea&s;t even you, my vir|tuous friend, who live in the daily practice of it, &s;hould be led to &s;uppo&s;e I have dre&s;&s;ed this worthy fact in the borrowed plumage of ima|gination,
<PB N="430" REF="449">from the circum&s;tance of the mer|chant's giving his unfortunate tenant a <HI>&s;ack</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> money, it is proper, you, and they, &s;hould be informed, if peradventure ye already know it not, that bills of exchange, drafts, &amp;c. &amp;c. are paid for the mo&s;t part in &s;ilver of different &s;orts and &s;izes; that five and twenty pounds &s;terling, of Engli&s;h money, thus converted into Dutch coins, returns you a very re&s;pon&s;i|ble looking bag, and that the double of this is, if paid in &s;mall pieces, as much as a man can well carry; and it is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee people carrying off a &s;um which would, by virtue of an Engli&s;h bank bill, lie &s;nug in a nut&s;hell, but which, thus <HI>Dutchified,</HI> fills a wheel-barrow. So that if the good merchant's &s;ack contained fifteen or twenty Engli&s;h pounds, which I pre|&s;ume it might, it would, though lightly borne by a man in di&s;tre&s;s, be a very dead weight to a modern beau of the&s;e degenerate days, unu&s;ed to feel either the pre&s;&s;ure of want, or the bli&s;s of &s;udden relief from it. Whatever might be the value of the &s;um in &s;ilver, it was more worth, in the eye of humanity, than the gold of Ophir; and you will join me, heartily, in a prayer, that it may be returned into the worthy donor's coffers, even in this world, a million fold, and that it may add to tho&s;e
<PB N="431" REF="450">trea&s;ures, which we are a&s;&s;ured, are lent to the Lord, and &s;hall be paid again! Of this heavenly recompen&s;e, you will think the gives yet more entitled, when you learn farther, that when he parted from the per&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted, there were the tears of benevolence gu&s;hing fa&s;t to his cheek, which he hurried away to conceal.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e things, I gather that the men of bu&s;ine&s;s in Am&s;terdam, may, many of them, be men of feeling at the &s;ame time; and that they are, though generally, too intently fixedon their grand objects to be diverted from pur&s;uing them, by an apparently idle &s;pectator, like your friend, &s;taring them in the face, they have eyes to &s;ee, ears to hear, and hearts to feel for the unfortunate. Tell me, whether in an a&s;&s;em|bly of the gay and fa&s;hionable, whether a &s;up|pliant, circum&s;tanced like our poor Frieze|lander, would have had, in the polite&s;t coun|try, a better chance of having his wants re|lieved than he found at Am&s;terdam, in a coun|try where gain is &s;aid to be the Aaron's &s;erpent, which &s;wallows up all other con&s;iderations, and particularly in the public Exchange, a place dedicated immediately to the God of riches? But a &s;uperior God, to whom mere riches are but as the dro&s;s of the earth, had
<PB N="432" REF="451">rai&s;ed a temple to benevolence, and the charities, in the bo&s;om of this merchant, who, therefore, found time to make his offerings of compa&s;&s;ion
<Q>"Ev'n there, where merchants mo&s;t do congregate."</Q> Yea, and &s;uffered his
<Q>"Bargains and his well-earn'd thrift,"</Q> to wait till this devotion of his heart was per|formed.</P>
<P>This great mart of commerce, from whence I &s;end you the&s;e Gleanings, was little more than a circum&s;cribed hamlet, before the thirteenth century. It ro&s;e to the dignity of a con&s;iderable fi&s;hing town by &s;low degrees, and it was not till towards the end of the four|teenth, that commerce &s;pread her more ex|panded &s;ails, and &s;ought it as her port. But after this it grew rapidly into a city, and in due time &s;urmounted all ob&s;tructions, and ro&s;e to the power, wealth, and grandeur, in which we now behold it, in&s;omuch that it is with great propriety it is called the Storehou&s;e of Europe, into which are brought the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful, and beautiful productions of the four quarters of the globe. I have traced the powers of its trade, with an attentive and a&s;toni&s;hed eye.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="452">There anchor at this moment at the quays of Am&s;terdam, a va&s;t number of ve&s;&s;els which have &s;ailed hither from every point of the compa&s;s; for there blows not a wind that does not prove favourable to &s;ome adventurer who &s;teers for this celebrated haven: Ru&s;&s;ia, Nor|wegia, Denmark, Sweden, Pomerania, Livonia, and the Baltic, with the commerce of the Elbe, the We&s;er, and the Meu&s;e, Great Britain, and its fair appendages, Spain, Por|tugal, Italy, contribute to the immen&s;e navi|gation of Holland.</P>
<P>As to the trade of the Levant, it was not till the year 1613, that the Dutch &s;ettled any in|tercour&s;e with the territory of the Grand Seignior. It pro&s;pered beyond expectation, after the treaty was once e&s;tabli&s;hed between them. The Levant merchandize con&s;i&s;ts prin|cipally of tea, cocoa, ginger, and thread: of Dutch, Iri&s;h and Engli&s;h cloths. In the Me|diterranean trade, e&s;pecially Smyrna, the Hol|lander has his &s;hare. His broad bottomed ve&s;&s;els are yearly fraught with &s;tores, which he takes in exchange for the profitable luxuries that are brought by the Carevanzeras of Per&s;ia; nor does the commercial &s;pirit limit it&s;elf to the&s;e countries; but &s;tretches onward
<PB N="434" REF="453">to Con&s;tantinople and Cairo; nor &s;uffers its ambitious enterprize to be bounded by any thing but tho&s;e parts of the globe, which navi|gation has not yet explored.</P>
<P>But there is yet &s;omething, and of a very liberal kind, no le&s;s exten&s;ive at Am&s;terdam, than its commerce. Its perfect freedom of con&s;cience and ceremonies in the great article of religion. The various modes of wor&s;hip which prevail among&s;t mankind, not only find here &s;ocial indulgence, but religious union; and it may be &s;aid, that wherever Holland has erected the &s;tandard of trade, &s;he has rai&s;ed al&s;o the &s;ignals of toleration, and invited the piou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed of all countries to her capital, that their &s;ecular and &s;acred, their temporal and eternal, intere&s;ts may be equally cultivated and protected.</P>
<P>Here it is, my friend, and perhaps only here, that, in matters of faith, all men are indeed free: and, as in Rome, during the liberal government of the Antonines and of Trajan, when <HI>her</HI> provinces were united by laws, and adorned by art, and when <HI>her</HI> capital was filled with &s;ubjects and &s;trangers, from every part of the world; the United Provinces
<PB N="435" REF="454">of Holland, hold out <HI>her</HI> capital as a temple &s;acred to the &s;pirit of univer&s;al concord, and though fixed on principles of everla&s;ting &s;teadi|ne&s;s, as to their own tenets, they offer to the re&s;t of the earth a fanctuary to adore, according to their different per&s;ua&s;ions, that God
<Q><L>"Who&s;e temple is all &s;pace,</L>
<L>"Who&s;e altar, earth, &s;ea, &s;kies!</L></Q> In return for this toleration, it is but fair to acknowledge that the &s;pirit of religious peace, that high, and, alas! rare ble&s;&s;ing, has been le&s;s hurt by the indulgence of the States, than from the jarring hi&s;tory of the world on this &s;ubject, might be expected. On the contrary it has been demon&s;trated that much of the horrible blood&s;hed which has been produced in other countries, and particularly in our own, by religious per&s;ecution, might have been pre|vented, had the charitable accommodation which di&s;tingui&s;hes this Republic been more generally practi&s;ed. The public &s;afety of the commonwealth, and the happine&s;s of each in|dividual, has rarely been found incompatible with the liberty of mind and opinion at Am|&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Nothing, indeed, that I can offer, can &s;hew &s;o fully the exten&s;ivene&s;s of this liberty, as ob|&s;erving
<PB N="436" REF="455">to you that, although there are neither convents, friars, nor abbe&s;&s;es, in the real mona&s;tic form, to be &s;een in Holland, there are, in this city, more than twenty churches, where the Roman Catholic religion is publicly tolerated. One of the&s;e, called Mo&s;es and Aaron, is a very beautiful edifice, and magni|ficently ornamented. There are two orders, however, of per&s;ons combined in religious a&s;&s;ociation, that you may, perhaps, con&s;ider as a &s;ort of exception to my a&s;&s;ertion of there being no conventual a&s;&s;emblies. I allude to the Society of Beguines. Of whom the fol|lowing is, out of many, the mo&s;t faithful Gleaning.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e appropriated to this order is built like a little di&s;tinct town, with a wall and ditch round it, and a church within, where the Beguines are obliged to attend divine &s;er|vice, "at &s;tated hours of prayer." They wear a habit of dark brown, not unlike the hermit weeds, in which we are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee pil|grims on the Engli&s;h theatre; they receive and pay vi&s;its, and may quit the convent, and marry, when they plea&s;e. They are either unmarried women or widows, who have no children; and need no other recommendation
<PB N="437" REF="456">for being admitted, but a certificate of their good behaviour, and that they have a compe|tency to live upon, either by them&s;elves, or in &s;ociety with the other &s;i&s;ters as they think fit.</P>
<P>In Roman Catholic countries, you know, there are many &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments. Their life is a kind of medium, between a &s;ecular and religious a&s;&s;ociation; and is, in effect, no more than a &s;ocial retirement, for regular people. There were, and I believe are &s;till, two hou&s;es of this kind, which I vi&s;ited &s;ome years ago in Flanders. They are about a mile in circum|ference, and con&s;i&s;t of neat little &s;treets, &s;o that they de&s;erve the name rather of &s;mall towns than religious hou&s;es. The church or chapel is always in the centre. Every Beguine has her apartment and garden. They have a chaplain; but take no vows of celibacy, &amp;c. The Beguines of Ghent and Bru&s;&s;els, wear black with a particular kind of round cover on their heads, plaited in the form of a ro&s;e, and about a foot in diameter. The re&s;t of their head-dre&s;s is of cambrick. Whenever they marry, as being &s;uppo&s;ed no longer to want &s;ociety, they quit the order. In great e&s;tabli&s;h|ments of this kind, the ladies have their car|riages; and, in &s;hort, Beguine is another
<PB N="438" REF="457">name for a woman to do whatever &s;he plea&s;es, and I do not know what female, who is not a very happy wi&s;e, might not wi&s;h to become a Beguine.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;ect, to be found in this all-tolerating city, is, that of the Rhyns|burgains, &s;o called becau&s;e the a&s;&s;embly of the per&s;ons, belonging to the above &s;ect, is held at the village of Rhyn&s;burg, near Leyden; and the three pea&s;ants who were the founders of the Rhyn&s;burgian religion lived there.</P>
<P>Their names were John, Adrian, and Gil|bert Van Code, each of whom was a rare example not only of &s;kill and diligence as farmers, but of erudition as lingui&s;ts, having as perfect a knowledge of languages as of agriculture, and cultivating both without &s;a|crificing the one to the other. A fourth brother, (William,) aro&s;e to the di&s;tinction, (certainly not without de&s;erving it) of Pro|fe&s;&s;or of the Oriental languages in the Uni|ver&s;ity of Leyden. Tho&s;e above-named, con|tinued to divide their labours betwixt the duties of the &s;pade, and the &s;tudy of divinity, and while yet in the flower of their age, be|came &s;o celebrated as to receive vi&s;its from
<PB N="439" REF="458">Prince Maurice, and Mon&s;ieur Du Maurier, the then Envoy of France. Maurice, who was him&s;elf a &s;cholar, conver&s;ed with the&s;e &s;elf|taught countrymen in Latin, Greek, Italian and French, in each of which tongues they replied with a &s;pirit and readine&s;s, (wanting only what, every body, not natal to them mu&s;t more or le&s;s want, correct pronunciation) that a&s;toni&s;hed their auditors.</P>
<P>The remon&s;trant clergy, being bani&s;hed in 1619, left their churches without a pa&s;tor: this determined our three brothers, who were of that &s;ect, to &s;upply the deficiency, under|taking to expound the Scriptures to the people. They admini&s;tered bapti&s;m, in the manner of the primitive Chri&s;tians; and &s;ettled their modes of wor&s;hip, on particular pa&s;&s;ages of the holy writings, e&s;pecially the fourteenth chapter of St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corin|thians. The e&s;&s;ential difference betwixt this and other Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;ociations, is not a little honorable to their community, viz. its tolera|tion of every other, every per&s;on being at full liberty to adore God, according to his own forms of faith. Every per&s;on admitted to their meetings, delivers in turn his &s;entiments, and offers up his prayers, without re&s;erve, on the
<PB N="440" REF="459">given text of the day, and a perfect equality prevails: the Bible is their &s;ole guide. They a&s;&s;emble on the Saturday, and enter into cer|tain preliminary di&s;cour&s;es, by way of pre|paration for the Sabbath, when one of the brothers di&s;tributes the bread and wine, humbly declaring him&s;elf as little worthy of that honour as the other communicants. On the Sunday evening they meet to enumerate the many motives of gratitude, which every mem|ber of the fraternity, has to return thanks to the &s;ountain of all good, and on the Monday morning, they take leave of each other, with the mo&s;t &s;ervent exhortations, to per&s;evere in virtue and religion; and in that per&s;everance to be uniform, whatever di&s;&s;imilarities may variegate their external ceremonies: for it is not uncommon for people of <HI>all</HI> modes of faith, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Rhyn&s;burgian A&s;|&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Religion and trade, however, are not the only things in this great town wherein there is unbounded freedom. They tolerate vice as well as virtue; the number of common brothels, licen&s;ed by the States, in almo&s;t every large town, is enormous. They are known by the name of Mu&s;ic-hou&s;es, of
<PB N="441" REF="460">which there are not le&s;s than five and twenty in Am&s;terdam. Strange as it may &s;eem to you, they are no le&s;s the repo&s;itories of guilt and &s;hame, than the re&s;orts of innocence and curi|o&s;ity, as per&s;ons of the be&s;t characters, and of both &s;exes, are to be &s;een in them, almo&s;t every evening. The Mu&s;ic-Hou&s;e, is among&s;t the public places, vi&s;ited by almo&s;t every &s;tranger: but you are to under&s;tand that the &s;cenes thus ex|hibited to travellers, are no otherwi&s;e gro&s;s, than as they excite ideas in&s;eparably connected with the &s;ight of &s;uch a number of females, devoted by avowed profe&s;&s;ion to a life of impurity. The Mu&s;ic-Hou&s;e has always one very &s;pacious apartment, where all per&s;ons are admitted on paying at entrance, the price of a bottle of wine. Two benches, the whole length of the room, are placed for the reception of inhabi|tants and vi&s;itors. There are &s;eldom le&s;s than twenty women belonging to one hou&s;e. The&s;e a&s;&s;emble about eleven at night, dre&s;&s;ed, or rather undre&s;&s;ed, in all the di&s;gu&s;ting di&s;plays of their trade; an enormous pad to &s;well out the hips, a flaming red petticoat, which &s;carce reaches the calf of the leg, an immen&s;e pair of &s;hoe-buckles, which nearly cover the foot, two broad black patches, the &s;ize of half-a-crown
<PB N="442" REF="461">piece, on the temples, and uncovered bo|&s;oms. This, indeed, excepting only the bo&s;oms, is the ordinary Dutch woman's &s;tyle dre&s;s. A mi&s;erable pair of fidlers are &s;craping in a corner of the room, which is flaringly lighted up with tallow candles; the men are, mo&s;t of them, &s;moking on the benches, and the women dancing in the middle. Some of the dances are curious enough: one in particular, where the man turns the woman round on tip|toe, &s;everal hundred times together, without the &s;malle&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion, with one hand encircling her wai&s;t, and elevating the other above the head, to meet her hand. The incre|dible rapidity with which this whirling is performed, and the length of time it continues, turns the &s;pectator giddy, but &s;eems to have no effect on the parties engaged in the dance. And while one couple are performing this roundabout, it is not uncommon for ten or a dozen others, to leap from their &s;eats, pipes in hand, and &s;eizing the girls, join in the twirl, like &s;o many <HI>te-to-tums,</HI> or rather &s;leep|ing tops; for, notwith&s;tanding their activity of limbs, there &s;eemsin their countenances, and even in their movements, a &s;ort of torpor, which the &s;prightlie&s;t plea&s;ure cannot di&s;&s;ipate: although it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the Dutch
<PB N="443" REF="462">are much addicted to dancing, and albeit, they beat the ground with the foot, rather of a giant than a fairy, they appear to derive from their unwieldy, and &s;ometimes ungraceful motions, &s;uch &s;olid happine&s;s, that a good natured &s;pectator, cannot but be him&s;elf happy, on the principle of general benevolence, to &s;ee an Hollander rampant.</P>
<P>Carter tells us, the&s;e Mu&s;ic-Hou&s;es have undergone diver&s;ity of fortune. Sometimes they have ample toleration: now and then they have in&s;pectors, to &s;ee that no indecencies are committed. At other times, in con&s;equence of great di&s;orders, they are &s;hut up, and perform a kind of quarantine, before the magi&s;trates &s;uffer them again to be open for the reception of company. In point of number, privileges, and enormities, they certainly exceed any thing of the kind, even in Rome it&s;elf. What the State offers in its own defence, on this head, amounts to the &s;tale maxim, that
<Q>"Private Vices are public Benefits."</Q></P>
<P>On the night I made this curious a&s;&s;embly my Gleaning vi&s;it, it was crouded with people of all countries: for it was during the time of the fair, and the humours of the Mu&s;ic-Hou&s;e, were con&s;idered as one of the fine &s;ights of the
<PB N="444" REF="463">fair. Among&s;t the &s;ets of &s;trangers that attracted my notice more particularly, was a groupe of female Friezeland pea&s;ants, dre&s;&s;ed in the picture&s;que habits of their Province. Bonnets made umbrella fa&s;hion, and not much le&s;s as to &s;ize; the linings of flowered linen, of a more flaring pattern than the out of date printed cotton, for bed-furniture, and window curtains: but at the extremity of the&s;e, were &s;nugly depo&s;ited &s;ome of the faire&s;t faces I ever beheld, which, coloured by mode&s;ty at the blu&s;hing &s;ight of &s;o many young creatures, who di&s;dained covering of almo&s;t any &s;ort, appeared yet more beautiful&mdash;the beauty of virtue&mdash; from the powerful advantage of immediate contra&s;t, with the deformity of vice.&mdash;In the lovely eyes of one, I gleaned the tear of innocence, pitying guilt, and at the &s;ame time, vindicating her &s;ex. This gentle drop was hid from the company in general. A young man, po&s;&s;ibly her lover, on who&s;e arm &s;he hung, &s;aw and felt it, for I perceived him pre&s;s her hand, and whi&s;per &s;omething that increa&s;ed the crim|&s;on in her face, and yet checked the tear upon her cheek, where it fixed midway, like a dew drop on the ro&s;e-bud.</P>
<P>Of the mu&s;ic-girls, many are pretty featured, but carry in every lineament, the &s;igns of
<PB N="445" REF="464">their lamentable vocation: &s;odden complexions, feebly glo&s;&s;ed over by artificial daubings of the wor&s;t colour; eyes that are commanded to attempt exciting pa&s;&s;ion, but which, in the very attempt, &s;eem di&s;obediently to &s;hrink into the &s;ockets; and con&s;trained merriment, which &s;ub&s;titutes a noi&s;y and di&s;cordant laugh, and childi&s;h anticks, for the notes of genuine mirth and unharra&s;&s;ed &s;pirits. How different, my friend, the powers of mode&s;ty, and the blu&s;hing honours in its train&mdash;how different from the blamele&s;s beings I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed for you&mdash;breathing health, and blooming in beauty, the ble&s;&s;ed effects of pure manners, air, and habitudes!</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the licen&s;ed hou&s;es of Am&s;terdam are, indeed, more unfortunately &s;ituated than any of their &s;adly merry &s;i&s;terhood of London. They are never &s;uffered to pa&s;s the doors, which are guarded by three or four ill-looking fellows, who literally con&s;ider them as private property. The&s;e keepers of their pri&s;on-hou&s;e (for it is not le&s;s &s;o, though with le&s;s accommodation) ab&s;olutely purcha&s;e them in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. The buyer finds them in the haunts of the la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and many are
<PB N="446" REF="465">&s;educed by the hope of an e&s;cape from famine, and the idlene&s;s which produced it, to accede to almo&s;t any terms. For a few weeks, they are &s;upplied, even to profu&s;ion, with not only nece&s;&s;ary comforts, but with tho&s;e meretricious and flaring decorations, which at once di&s;cover their trade and their ta&s;te. Little do they &s;u&s;|pect that this bounty is a trap to catch them; that it is intended only to plunge them beyond redemption deep in guilt and &s;lavery, &s;erving the double purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing out the victim, and binding the pri&s;oner in chains&mdash;though they &s;eem of &s;ilk&mdash;of &s;in and mi&s;ery, and di&s;ea&s;e and death.</P>
<P>They have not united them&s;elves to the wretched &s;ociety of the mu&s;ic hou&s;e a &s;ingle month e'er they find them&s;elves involved in unpayable debts, &s;ome of three, others of five hundred guilders, for tho&s;e very articles, which at once increa&s;e the revenue of their tyrants, and aggravate their own poverty and guilt. They have literally nothing to offer but per|&s;onal &s;ecurity, and as it rarely happens a gal|lant can be found to pay the price of their ran|&s;om, they remain &s;laves for life, &s;ubject to ri|gours, to which no other &s;laves are liable.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="466">After I had been a &s;ilent &s;pectator of this female jail, the harde&s;t to which any culprit <HI>can</HI> be condemned, I perceived many of the pri|&s;oners, jaded with mu&s;ic and dancing, for the charms of which they could have no reli&s;h, fallen into a profound &s;leep, out of which their cruel owners arou&s;ed them by the mo&s;t brutal language, and even by blows.</P>
<P>Certain di&s;ciplinarians have thought that a &s;ight of the hateful portraits of vice do but recommend tho&s;e of virtue. So far as that is true, a vi&s;it to the mu&s;ic-hou&s;es of Am&s;terdam may conduce to the intere&s;ts of morality. Un|que&s;tionably a youth who has been trained in the principles of a pure education, and known the endearments of &s;ociety; when refined and &s;oftened by innocent women, could &s;uffer no permanent &s;tain by a review of &s;cenes from which, indeed, a man of the lea&s;t touch of pity, or &s;en&s;e of what is due to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of even the wor&s;t of the &s;ex, would turn with revolt, or ob&s;erve only with commi&s;eration. And hence it is, that I am inclined to think the ten|dere&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, or the mo&s;t faithful wife would have little to fear from a lover's or hu&s;band's in&s;pection of the&s;e di&s;graceful and di&s;gu&s;ting receptacles. What could they exhibit but the
<PB N="448" REF="467">exce&s;&s;es of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, oppo&s;ed to the perfec|tion of the mo&s;t delicate pa&s;&s;ion? And, after allowing for the po&s;&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion of a tran|&s;ient view, and the effect it might have on hu|man frailty, I &s;hould venture to believe that the un&s;ullied charms of a virtuous woman mu&s;t gain fre&s;h honours and triumphs from the <HI>de&s;cent</HI> of their admirers into the&s;e regions of indecency, intere&s;t, and loathing, where all is glaring, forced, and unnatural.</P>
<P>A far more dangerous &s;ituation, my friend, is that, where, to the blandi&s;hments of &s;eduction, are joined the &s;emblances of virtue. Where female libertini&s;m arrays her&s;elf in the robes of apparent innocence, and where the relenting heart is taken captive by temptations that almo&s;t per&s;uade it, that it is yielding it&s;elf up, rather a votary to virtue, than a victim to vice.</P>
<P>But I am upon trembling ground; and will go lightly off, while I may yet e&s;cape tho&s;e over-nice morali&s;ts, who are &s;o wonderfully apt to mi&s;-interpret a pa&s;&s;ing reflection into a re|commendation or encouragement of error. By what I have thrown out on this &s;ubject, I give only the re&s;ult of my own feelings, which have always a&s;&s;ured me that there is not more poetry
<PB N="449" REF="468">than truth (and particularly in applying them to women) in the&s;e well-known ver&s;es,
<Q><L>"Vice is a mon&s;ter of &s;o frightful mien,</L>
<L>"As to be hated needs but to be &s;een."</L></Q> And, though the &s;ub&s;equent lines
<Q><L>"Yet &s;een too oft, familiar with her face,</L>
<L>"We fir&s;t endure, then pity, then embrace,"</L></Q> may be al&s;o true, in a general &s;en&s;e, it may be con&s;idered &s;o far as an exception here, ina&s;much as the embrace it&s;elf is &s;ucceeded by an hatred of vice, and a return to virtue.</P>
<P>It is time, however, we take our leave of this great and populous city. You will allow it is well entitled to the latter epithet, when you are reminded that at a medium for fifteen years nine thou&s;and per&s;ons have died in it annually. In Paris, for the like term of years, twice that number have de&s;cended to the tomb. I &s;peak of the time of the deaths of nature, ere the introduction of the dreadful guillotine&mdash;of who&s;e deva&s;tations I am &s;oon to &s;peak.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand that the bills of mortality in London, for the like &s;pace, give in a calcula|tion of twenty-four thou&s;and. I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and would be nearer the truth, if we include the villages and detached hou&s;es.
<PB N="450" REF="469">The pre&s;ent averaged number, therefore, of the inhabitants of the&s;e three capitals of Europe, according to the u&s;ual e&s;timate by deaths, &s;tands thus: Am&s;terdam upwards of 230,000; Paris, 500,000; and London, about 700,000. At Rome, no public regi&s;ters of chri&s;tenings, or burials, are kept; but in 1683, M. Augout computed the inhabitants at about 125,000. In 1714, Pope Clement II. cau&s;ed an exact ac|count to be taken by S. Carraccioli, which he made to be 104,300 &s;ouls, including &s;trangers, who are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be 20,000.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted by Carter, however, that the inhabitants of the two Provinces of Holland, and Zealand, do not con&s;i&s;t of more than one million and a half, that is, little more than half an acre for every head.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Am&s;terdam has been ju&s;tly called the modern Tyre, for beauty, opulence, and accommodation of every kind: and the government of the city is &s;o well regulated, that in five years there are not five malefactors ex|ecuted. In &s;hort, whatever is the particular bent of a traveller's di&s;po&s;ition; whether trade, or plea&s;ure be the object, he explores, he may find wherewithal to gratify him&s;elf in this city,
<PB N="451" REF="470">to which we will now bid adieu, as I wi&s;h now to conduct you to one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities either in this or in any other country; I mean North Holland, where I have pa&s;&s;ed fome of the mo&s;t agreeable days of my life, and where every thing one &s;ees is &s;o appropriate and di|&s;tinct, that in a quick tran&s;ition from Am&s;ter|dam, the contra&s;t is almo&s;t as great as if one were to be &s;uddenly tran&s;ported into a new world.&mdash;My friend, farewell.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I have ju&s;t recollected a pa&s;&s;age of the great author of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, on the &s;ubject of Roman popu|lation, which far exceeded the e&s;timate I have ju&s;t mentioned. The number of &s;ubjects who acknowledged the laws of Rome, of citizens, provincials, and &s;laves, cannot now be fixed with &s;uch a degree of accuracy as the import|ance of the object would de&s;erve. We are informed that when the Emperor Claudius exerci&s;ed the office of Cen&s;or, he took an account of &s;ix millions nine hundred and forty|five thou&s;and citizens, who, with the propor|tion of women and children, mu&s;t have amounted to about twenty millions of &s;ouls. But, after weighing, with attention, every cir|cum&s;tance which could influence the balance,
<PB N="452" REF="471">it &s;eems probable that there exi&s;ted, in the time of Claudius, about twice as many provincials as there were citizens, of either &s;ex, and of every age; and that the &s;laves were, at lea&s;t, equal in number to the free inhabitants of the Roman world. The total amount then of this important calculation would ri&s;e to about one hundred and twenty millions of per&s;ons: <Q>a degree of population (&s;ays Gibbon) which po&s;|&s;ibly exceeds that of modern Europe, and forms the mo&s;t numerous &s;ociety, that has ever been admitted, or united under the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of government.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER L. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>North Holland.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEYOND di&s;pute, the little country from whence I date this letter, is the mo&s;t de|&s;erving to be in&s;pected, as a curio&s;ity, of any, not only in the Seven, but in the Seventeen Provinces; and yet, like many other de&s;erving objects in this perver&s;e world of our's, is the lea&s;t vi&s;ited by tho&s;e who have even no other motive of travel than to gratify curio&s;ity. Sa|tisfied with &s;eeing the capital, which they run over as if that time which they throw away, were really precious to them, they &s;hift the &s;cene with the rapidity of our ancient play|wrights, who, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle act, which takes half an hour in the repre&s;entation, carry us from one quarter of the globe to ano|ther, leaping the &s;pace between, though "whole oceans roll," to &s;top them, with as much ea&s;e as if they were &s;tepping over a gutter. In&s;o|much that a thorough-paced traveller will breakfa&s;t in Helvoet&s;luice, dine at Rotterdam, take &s;upper at Am&s;terdam, return the next
<PB N="454" REF="473">morning to breakfa&s;t at the Hague; and write a tour, through Holland, of what he has not &s;een, in good time for the returning packet. But more &s;edate per&s;ons, as has been well ob&s;erved, by one who deplored it, rarely vi&s;it the province of North Holland, but turn their backs on the country, as &s;oon as they have &s;een Am&s;terdam; thereby lo&s;ing a view of one of the mo&s;t beautifully romantic &s;pots in the whole world.</P>
<P>I will proceed, my friend, to ju&s;tify this a&s;&s;ertion, by gleaning for you what, on com|paring the given de&s;criptions with the eye|witne&s;&s;ed facts, I find to be the mo&s;t faithful.</P>
<P><HI>North</HI> Holland is another name for <HI>We&s;t</HI> Frie&s;land, paradoxical as that may &s;ound. Formerly, it was a mar&s;h compo&s;ed of many great lakes, &s;eparated from each other only by high roads or dikes; but now nothing remains of them, except their names and dimen&s;ions in maps. With incredible toil, they have been entirely drained, and changed into the delicious place I have ju&s;t mentioned. Even Sir William Temple, who was not apt to &s;peak too kindly of Holland, ob&s;erved, that a once rotten mar&s;h, the draining of which was the ince&s;&s;ant labour
<PB N="455" REF="474">of four years; a &s;pace, including highways and dikes, of no more than ten thou&s;and acres, is &s;o well planted with gardens, orchards, and maje&s;tic rows of trees, as to form the mo&s;t plea&s;ant land&s;cape he ever &s;aw. <Q>It was here, &s;ays Temple, that I met with a curio&s;ity yet greater than the place it&s;elf&mdash;a poor fellow in an ho&s;pital (a &s;uperannuated &s;eaman) who proved to be the only rich man I ever &s;aw in my life: for, on offering him a crown, as a reward for the trouble of &s;hewing me the ho&s;pital, and giving me with the hi&s;tory of the place, the hi&s;tory of him&s;elf, as one of its mo&s;t veteran members, in a very plea&s;ant manner, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed my money, &s;aying he <HI>could</HI> have no u&s;e for it, being plen|tifully &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;&s;ary in the ho&s;pital.</Q></P>
<P>The manners and cu&s;toms of North Holland are &s;aid to differ e&s;&s;entially from tho&s;e in the South; but I could trace the di&s;&s;imilitude only in the articles of dre&s;s, and &s;uperior neatne&s;s: for though all the Provinces are clean on the &s;urface, this of We&s;t Frie&s;land is &s;o even to a painful affectation. Saardam, Alkmaar, Hoorn, Enkhui&s;m, Edam, Monnikendam, Broek, Me|denbik, and Parmerende are the principal towns.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="475">The fir&s;t is a village, where, in&s;tead of a gleaning, a traveller of curio&s;ity may gather an harve&s;t. The &s;ingle article of windmills and woodmills would afford him a &s;heaf. The number of each is really incredible. There are not le&s;s than two hundred and fifty of the mills to cut wood into planks, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hip-building, of which the proce&s;s will prove a morning's entertainment to any man, and of which the invention is due to Corn|neille Van Uitgu&s;t. I have never &s;een them even in our naval i&s;land, where, a&s;&s;uredly, they would prove a powerful auxiliary; or am I mi&s;taken? Have they been adopted by our ingenious countrymen? I recommend them, at all events to every traveller, who, like my|&s;elf, hath never &s;een them before. Saardam, like the other towns of North Holland, is al|mo&s;t entirely of wood, painted on the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> with as much care, as to colour and figures, as our choice&s;t apartments on the <HI>in&s;ide.</HI> Be|fore and behind every hou&s;e, even in this bu&s;y, populous, and commercial town, which con|tains many thou&s;and inhabitants, are little gardens, the eighth, tenth, and even twentieth of an acre, where flowers, vegetables, &s;hrubs, gra&s;s-plots, and cockle-&s;hell walks, are ar|ranged in &s;o &s;ingular a manner, that they &s;eem
<PB N="457" REF="476">rather the property, and indeed the work of fairy fingers and fairy people, than of a hardy, heavy looking, &s;et of men and women, who&s;e lighte&s;t tread or touch might &s;eem to throw them into irretrievable di&s;order. You cannot look at a tree of a year's growth, but its bark is painted of all hues, figures, and fancies; nor can you &s;it down on a bench, without pre&s;&s;ing under you blue tigers, red wolves, green foxes, yellow rabbits, and white ravens. Ta&s;te is ab&s;olutely forbid to enter North Hol|land; but in lieu of it, whim is privileged to play whatever pranks he thinks proper, &s;o as he makes no dirt. They almo&s;t quarrel with nature, whom they welcome during the &s;pring and &s;ummer, for dropping her leaves upon their &s;hell-walks in autumn. But of this more in its place.</P>
<P>The paper-mills of Saardam are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Holland: for, while Louis the XIVth was making an irruption in 1672, many of the mo&s;t ingenious paper-makers took refuge in this town, carrying with them their families, and the art by which they were &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>Indu&s;try becomes &s;tationary, where mo&s;t fa|voured, and at Saardam the encouragements
<PB N="458" REF="477">were too great to permit a &s;econd emigration. Near an hundred thou&s;and reams of po&s;t pa|per are annually fabricatedat Sardaam; and a like proportion of grey and blue.</P>
<P>The Saardam ve&s;&s;els are al&s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, and here it was that Peter the Great, of Ru&s;|&s;ia, gained his elementary knowledge of &s;hip|building. It is afferted, perhaps with &s;ome boa&s;t, that a &s;ingle &s;hip-carpenter &s;et a navy of twenty con&s;iderable ve&s;&s;els on float.</P>
<P>But Saardam has yet other attractions, and which &s;ome travellers may think greater ob|jects of curio&s;ity, in a country where the Cy|prian godde&s;s is not reputed to keep her faire&s;t court, than any I have yet mentioned. The women of this town are generally hand&s;ome; and, notwith&s;tanding, on a fir&s;t acquaintance, there is an air of di&s;tance, re&s;erve, and even coldne&s;s, they are all, as well as men, replete with an anxious de&s;ire to <HI>break the ice,</HI> and when broken, make up lo&s;t time by &s;uch a flow of que&s;tions, and with &s;uch rapidity, that you mu&s;t be gifted with uncommon &s;peed your&s;elf not to be overborne by the torrent, which hur|ries away with your an&s;wers almo&s;t before they can get them out of your mouth. This
<PB N="459" REF="478">loquacious character is, indeed, a characteri&s;tic mark of a Dutch woman; and yet none but a re&s;identiary Gleaner can di&s;cover it. A fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, and even fourth vi&s;it, does not often &s;erve to thaw the inveterate and chilling air which &s;eems to bind up their tongues. They hear you, at length, with a fixed, doll-like &s;tare, and an&s;wer you in &s;hort, exchanging a mono|&s;yllable for a &s;peech, or more frequently giving only &s;ome nods, of which they are all prodi|gal, for half an hour's conver&s;ation. But when you can once make them a&s;&s;imilate, which the habit of &s;eeing you will effect, by degrees, a knot of Dutch women over their &s;toves, equal, if they do not &s;urpa&s;s, in &s;port, chit-chat, and plea&s;antry, with due propor|tions of tittle-tattle, any female convention over their tea-tables, and even that which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be appropriate to the tea-table, and indeed a part of its equipage, namely, good, &s;olid detraction.</P>
<P>The entrance of a &s;tranger, however, has the power of &s;topping them in mid career. The merrie&s;t of the circle would forego her je&s;t; and even the mo&s;t malicious would let her neighbour's reputation, when &s;he had ju&s;t got it between her teeth, fall from her lips. I
<PB N="460" REF="479">had an opportunity to glean an in&s;tance of this. Some frolick&s;ome Dutch girls &s;tarted in a conver&s;ation, where, as a dome&s;tic friend, I was permitted to mingle, the character of a young woman, who was &s;u&s;pected of growing more &s;uddenly corpulent, than in the way of general <HI>en-bon-point,</HI> &s;he ought to do. The whole party followed the trail, and joined in the cry again&s;t this poor ab&s;entee, who, by the bye, was a native of this very town of Saar|dam. Never was any mi&s;erable hare more hardly hunted than this luckle&s;s girl's charac|ter. It was fairly, or rather unfairly, worried by the young and the old. At la&s;t, a lady, who had been hitherto the lea&s;t violent of the pack, caught it from her next neighbour, who had been giving it &s;ome hearty &s;hakes her&s;elf, and de|termined upon tearing it all in tatters, exclaim|ed in the mo&s;t vehement Dutch I ever heard uttered&mdash;'tis a terrible language for anger&mdash; <Q>take it from me, ladies, this girl, as &s;ure as I am putting this fire under my petticoats, is, and always was, a mo&s;t de&s;igning, for|ward, good-for-nothing hu&s;&s;ey; and if &s;he is not now big with child, I, that am the ho|ne&s;t mother of two-and-twenty, am a maid&mdash; yes, take it from me, &s;he is a vile &s;trum&mdash;</Q>
<PB N="461" REF="480">&mdash;Strum-pet &s;he would have &s;aid, but the hu&s;band of one of the party leading in a &s;tranger, cut off the la&s;t &s;yllable, which fell to the ground with the remains of the mangled reputation.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger remained till the party broke up, but, whether from the &s;everity of the di&s;|appointment, or any other cau&s;e, the loude&s;t and the mo&s;t voluble groupe that &s;lander ever gathered together, became the mo&s;t taciturne and &s;ullen: in&s;omuch that the &s;tranger, whom I met the next day at the coffee-hou&s;e, a&s;ked me, if I had ever &s;een &s;uch an horrid &s;ilent meeting, a&s;&s;uring me, at the &s;ame time, that he had employed all his morning in &s;ending to his friends in England a true picture of a vi&s;it to a Dutch family, where nothing was either looked or &s;aid for &s;everal hours, though there were near a dozen females in company!</P>
<P>I contented my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that if he remained in the country long enough to be|come dome&s;tic in the family, he might po&s;&s;ibly collect materials for a letter of a very different ca&s;t: in the mean while, his friends would doubtle&s;s be much entertained.</P>
<P>"Long enough in the country," no, cried the gentleman! <Q>I have had enough, and do not
<PB N="462" REF="481">mean to repeat my vi&s;it, I thank you. I love &s;ociety, and mu&s;t hear a little conver&s;ation, as well as &s;ee a good deal of beauty, which, I own, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I ob&s;erved, amid&s;t the &s;till-life of la&s;t night. No, Sir, I have had enough of Dutch ladies, and &s;hall go into a country where women can &s;peak, as well as hold their tongues, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>As it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to remove the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, I let them pa&s;s; for it would have been in vain to a&s;&s;ure this <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> traveller, that the fair Hollanders he had thus accu&s;ed of being dumb, were they to exert their powers, could talk him deaf; add to which, the tradi|tion goes, that a Dutch wife is always the head of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Their general complexion is clear and fine, as to a proper quantum of white and red, but the effect is lo&s;t by the immoveable fixture of both. A &s;tranger to the &s;ettled colours would pronounce, them artificial: the red forms one &s;trong circle in each cheek, and yields, no, not for a moment, to occurrences or to pa&s;&s;ions. In rage, in jealou&s;y, in love, in &s;urpri&s;e, and even in fear, this rubied hue neither increa&s;es nor dimini&s;hes; the &s;ame
<PB N="463" REF="482">inflexibility holds good as to the white, which gives their countenances the air of wax-work painted. The&s;e &s;teady colourings are &s;carcely removed by age: I have &s;een a great many women who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them unmixed, and un|impaired, to their &s;eventieth year. The old women of Liege are the only part of the &s;ex, who are, almo&s;t without an exception, of the wor&s;t colours, forms, and features; in&s;omuch that had not male gallantry long &s;ince &s;et it down among&s;t the inviolable etiquettes, that a female cannot be ugly, I &s;hould not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that at Liege a race of women might be found, who re&s;embled rather Vulcan than Venus, both in &s;hape and hue. This &s;trength of allu&s;ion, however, being inhibited, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that all ranks of the &s;ex are, in the part of Germany above-mentioned, le&s;s likely to make a man &s;hoot him&s;elf through the head, after being &s;hot through the heart, than in any other country I have yet vi&s;ited. In my fir&s;t tour through Flanders, I wi&s;hed, out of the &s;pirit of candour that is in me, added to a &s;incere love and admira|tion of the &s;ex, to vindicate the females of this town from this cen&s;ure. To which end I &s;allied forth on knight-errant principles, to do the dam&s;els and the dames ju&s;tice. The morning was fine, the weather was warm, and
<PB N="464" REF="483">the &s;un had drawn every body abroad. How a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, how generou&s;ly, did I follow every petticoat, and meet every apron, to di&s;cover pretty features and a good complexion: yea, and often di&s;appointed as I was, I &s;till che|ri&s;hed the hope of finding, in the next comer or goer, a face that might ran&s;om the re&s;t. I could, returning at du&s;k, only glean a few hand&s;ome eyes, more to be admired, for their blackne&s;s than the teeth, which &s;eemed to vie with them, as a&s;&s;erting the charms of a finer jett. Of Liege, you know, it has been &s;aid, that it is the hell of women, becau&s;e the poor of that &s;ex do the work of our coal-heavers. I could not help a&s;&s;igning another rea&s;on for this appellation, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e both rich and poor
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not peculiar to Liege&mdash;but is al&s;o cu&s;tomary at <HI>Lei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> near Edinburgh.</NOTE> of that large, and ancient town were &mdash;fill up the blank, my dear friend; for it cannot be expected I &s;hould &s;o little re&s;pect the laws of <HI>pre-determined</HI> politene&s;s, as to in&s;inuate any thing about ugly as the deuce. The hell of women it is &s;till called, be the rea&s;on what it may: al&s;o the purgatory of men, becau&s;e they are almo&s;t all governed by their wives, their &s;appho-faced partners,&mdash;and the paradi&s;e of monks, becau&s;e of the rich bene|fices. The latter, however, is ju&s;t now a little out of repair, as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical fruits have
<PB N="465" REF="484">been more than once &s;eized upon by the &s;poiler.</P>
<P>The village of Alkmaar is &s;o environed by gardens, orchards, canals, avenues, and mea|dows, that, if we include the beautiful little wood in its neighbourhood, it may be pro|nounced one of the mo&s;t highly cultivated and blooming &s;pots in the world. Many Chri&s;tian communities a&s;&s;emble here; and you are &s;hewn a &s;et of buildings &s;acred to age, known in Holland under the name of <HI>Hofje,</HI> the hou&s;es of elderly women.</P>
<P>It is an article of admittance into this place, that the party entering renounces marriage for the re&s;t of her life, whether ancient virgin, or widow, and to break all &s;ort of intercour&s;e with mankind. This vow re&s;embles not a little that of the mona&s;tery, but, then, it is a little ea&s;ier to be ob&s;erved, &s;ince it is not im|po&s;ed till age it&s;elf has made it a matter of no great difficulty.</P>
<P>Fruits and flowers, and groves, and fair mea|dows, in Holland! methinks I hear you ex|claim. Yes, truly, my dear friend; albeit thorough-fare travellers have a&s;&s;ured us, 'tis only a collection of dykes and ditches, with a few huge rows of trees, where half the plat|form
<PB N="466" REF="485">ju&s;t reflects the other, I again and again a&s;&s;ort, that in this &s;eque&s;tered village of Alk|maar, and in very many other &s;weet nooks and corners, where travellers of the above de&s;crip|tion di&s;dain to go, there is very beautiful &s;cenery, and worth a vi&s;it, were there no other attraction, becau&s;e the ornaments, the di&s;po|&s;ition of the ground, the arrangement of the flowers, and the novelty of the walks, are cu|rious and original.</P>
<P>In the next town, which is a con&s;iderable &s;ea-port on the banks of the Zuyder Sea, (Hoorn) the meadow grounds are delicious. The pub|lic walks are extremely fine, and to variegate the pro&s;pect of eight or ten thou&s;and indu&s;tri|ous people at work in the docks and ve&s;&s;els, you have, clo&s;e under your eye, upwards of four hundred gardens, in which a weed would be looked upon as an offence &s;carce le&s;s heinous than a mor&s;el of dirt in any part of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Enkhuizen, Edam, and Monnikendam, have the &s;ame &s;ort of beauties in the &s;ame abun|dance; nor is Mendenbik or Purmerind un|worthy notice. But the beautiful and &s;ingular village of Broek will command a more parti|cular de&s;cription. Mr. Peckham has with
<PB N="467" REF="486">great ju&s;tice called it one of the prettie&s;t little towns in the world. A journey of a thou&s;and miles would be repaid with plea&s;ure, were there no other objects than &s;uch as a&s;&s;emble in the village of Broek. The whole of it is a cabinet of curio&s;ities, on which one can &s;carce gaze, without trembling, le&s;t &s;ome injury &s;hould be done them even by our homage. My pen &s;eems not &s;ufficiently delicate to de&s;cribe them. There is but one &s;treet through which carriages of any kind are permitted to pa&s;s; and that, as if profaned, is but thinly furni&s;hed with inhabitants. Every part of every hou&s;e, within and without, is painted with the mo&s;t co&s;tly colours; and though &s;e|parately examined, the figures and ornaments would be found to violate all laws of propor|tion, the general effect is really charming. Every &s;treet (the one above excepted, is, in every part, clean beyond all compari&s;on, and little gardens, where perennial verdure and bloom &s;eems to pre&s;ide, (for not a blade of gra&s;s, nor a withered leaf, is &s;uffered to re&s;t on the ground) extend from one end of the &s;treet to the other; each man's proper bounds being di&s;tingui&s;hed by fences of every &s;ort and kind, but all ornamented with a care that makes one rather afraid to touch them. The hou&s;es are roofed with tiles &s;o glo&s;&s;y, that in
<PB N="468" REF="487">the &s;un-&s;hine they glitter like &s;par. The pavement of the &s;treet is inlay-work, of beautifully &s;mall pebbles of various forms and colours, &s;quared or diamonded, cro&s;|&s;ed and intercro&s;&s;ed, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, agreeable to the ta&s;te or fancy of the proprietors. Shells, pieces of glazed brick, marbles, gla&s;s beads, &amp;c. are called in as auxiliaries. To tread upon them &s;eems not only profanation, but perill; and indeed the in|habitants &s;eem to be of the &s;ame opinion; for the greater part tread with a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing caution, and look critically at the &s;hoes of every pa&s;&s;enger. In &s;hort, were not the age of enchantment pa&s;t, even from the fairy land of fiction, and could one reduce the &s;olid limbs and unwieldy forms of the owners of this wonder-working village, a traveller coming into it, from the city of Am&s;terdam, might fancy him&s;elf tran&s;ported by &s;ome magician into a region of fairies.</P>
<P>As the fact is, it &s;eems, on a compari&s;on of the <HI>place</HI> with the people, that the natives of Brobdignag have here e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in a town of Lilliput.</P>
<P>Broek is divided and &s;ubdivided by number|le&s;s little rivulets that &s;erpentine by the &s;ides
<PB N="469" REF="488">the hou&s;es; the paintings and ornaments on the out&s;ide of every hou&s;e look &s;o vivid, as to the colours, as to &s;eem but ju&s;t fini&s;hed; yet they have, mo&s;t of them, &s;tood the tyranny of wind and weather three or four years. In &s;uch pretty baby-hou&s;es for grown, and, I am &s;ure, I may &s;ay <HI>full</HI> grown ladies and gentle|men, there reigns more &s;implicity than you would &s;uppo&s;e. I &s;peak of the interior of the&s;e little paradi&s;es, where, by the bye, it is not very ea&s;y for a traveller to gain admittance. The North Hollanders are exce&s;&s;ively &s;hy at fir&s;t &s;ight&mdash;at Broek more particularly&mdash;and "of &s;omewhat a jealous complexion;" for if a &s;tranger of a wild air, and rude manner, ap|pears among&s;t them, they return his behaviour in kine, by &s;hutting their doors in his face; and as a farther proof of di&s;like or fear, order their wives and daughters into the mo&s;t retired apartments, where they remain pri&s;oners, till they have a&s;&s;urance of the intruder having left the place. It is, however, only <HI>impertinent</HI> cu|rio&s;ity, or that air of rude command, which too often accompanies a &s;tranger who refu&s;es to make allowances, that is thus di&s;appointed. While I was drinking coffee with a family at Broek, two &s;trangers pa&s;&s;ed the window in a di&s;orderly manner, peeped into the room, and were ru&s;hing forward without any other notice.
<PB N="470" REF="489">Two very pretty daughters and their mother, were put to flight in&s;tantly, and the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e ran to fa&s;ten his door, after which he came and took my hand, ob&s;erving that although he did not keep an inn for every &s;aucy or lazy fellow to come and do what he thought proper, he knew what was due to a quiet and well-di&s;po&s;ed gue&s;t, &s;aying which, he took the opportunity of the ladies ab&s;ence to walk over the apartments, all of which, and particu|larly that which held his be&s;t bed, were, he a&s;&s;ured me, entirely at my &s;ervice, &s;o long as I thought proper to make u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>In Broek, there is a great deal of female agreeablene&s;s, among&s;t the people of higher ranks; but the pea&s;ant girls who inhabit the environs, are of a complexion &s;o delicate, and the white and red &s;o &s;weetly diffu&s;ed, and in &s;uch ju&s;t proportions, that it is worth any per|&s;on's while to deport him&s;elf peaceably, were it only for the &s;ake of getting a &s;ight of them; which certainly would not be done by an hurry-&s;curry traveller, were he to remain in the town, for a twelve-month. The Dutch women &s;eldom &s;tir abroad, and &s;carce ever to take a walk as it is called.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="490">Peckham tells us of a &s;ingular cu&s;tom re|tained in North Holland, of having a door in every hou&s;e, which is never opened, but when a corp&s;e is carried out: he &s;hould have added the information of this door's being opened only on <HI>two</HI> occa&s;ions&mdash;the <HI>marriage</HI> or death of &s;ome one of the family. There is &s;omething very &s;olemn in the cu&s;tom, and may conduce, perhaps, to &s;ome dome&s;tic morality. It is the great door in the centre of the hou&s;e. A &s;maller one, on the left hand &s;ide, is that which &s;erves for ordinary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Brock are chiefly per&s;ons who have retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, or who are connected with &s;ome commercial hou&s;es in Am&s;terdam. They are extremely rich; and it is here that the practice &s;till prevails among&s;t the wealthy pea&s;antry of di&s;po&s;ing of their children in marriage by weight of metal. A countryman dre&s;&s;ed in a coar&s;e blue doublet is the father of a young man, who is to be &s;old in wedlock: he meets the buyer, another country|man, who is the parent of the girl, that is to be bought. While the parties thus to be di&s;po&s;ed of, are trying to become agreeable to one another, or, at lea&s;t, to accommodate, the old folks are making the bargain for them, over a pipe of tobacco.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="491">Will you give your &s;on to my daughter with &s;o many barrels of gold?</P>
<P>I cannot.</P>
<P>She cannot be afforded for le&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, I will give it.</P>
<P>Then take her.&mdash;I will cart the ca&s;h to|morrow.</P>
<P>Done. A match.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s is done, and they are as happy, at lea&s;t, as money can make them.</P>
<P>The painful neatne&s;s of the hou&s;es within, and the &s;treets without, have been productive of the following anecdote. The ancient Vicar of Broek being dead, and much lamented, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or tried every method that a worthy prie&s;t could think of, to repair the lo&s;s, not only as to his pa&s;toral duty, but as to &s;ociety. "I would fain gain your good will and con|ciliate your e&s;teem, my dear pari&s;hioners," &s;aid he, "How is it I fail?"</P>
<P>The want of confidence in the inhabitants, made the new Vicar unhappy: and yet for many months, he could get no one to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for it. At length, an old man, one of his congregation, after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;poke as follows: "I will tell you, Mr. Vicar. You are a fine &s;cholar: you talk Greek and Latin:
<PB N="473" REF="492">your di&s;cour&s;es are very learned; but you mount the reading de&s;k and pulpit in your &s;hoes, after having walked through the &s;treet. Your predece&s;&s;or always put on a pair of &s;lip|pers, which are &s;till left for your u&s;e in the con&s;i&s;tory. You know, now, the cau&s;e of the &s;hyne&s;s and di&s;affection of the pari&s;h: and you know, al&s;o, the way to remove it."</P>
<P>The Vicar took the hint, and ever after adopting the &s;lippers, very &s;oon became as great a favourite as the good man he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Peckham has noticed very exactly, the curio&s;ity of the head-dre&s;s of the women of North Holland. A little hair cut very &s;hort and thin, which is combed down on the fore|head, and powdered. The cap &s;ticks clo&s;e to their ears, and under it are two pieces of &s;ilver or gold, which appear at each temple, and a broad piece is under the cap on the back part of the head.</P>
<P>Of the &s;aw-mill, his de&s;cription is the mo&s;t accurate that can be given. Forty boards can be &s;awed at the &s;ame time. The flies of the mill are fixed to a large beam, which turns on an axis; in the centre of the beam, is the grand wheel, which puts in motion another
<PB N="474" REF="493">immediately below it; this is likewi&s;e fixed on the middle of a piece of timber, which hangs on an axis; and to which four perpendicular &s;aws, ten in each compartment, are fa&s;tened; which, as the wheel goes round, are elevated, and again thru&s;t down. At the end of this beam are too iron hooks, which catch a wheel, and each time the &s;aw goes up and down, it moves this wheel one cog, that wheel moves another, which catches into a piece of iron, and draws it towards it&s;elf. At the end of this iron is a cro&s;s bar, which pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the end of the tree, while the other end is &s;aw|ing, and pu&s;hes it on to the teeth of the &s;aw, with a motion proportionate to the di&s;patch of the &s;aws.</P>
<P>When you compare, my friend, the effect of all this with the tedious proce&s;s of our com|mon Engli&s;h &s;aw-pit, you will wi&s;h with me, that &s;uch of our timber merchants as are ignorant of it, would take the hint, and con|de&s;cend to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>The oil and tobacco-mills are equally curious, but as their con&s;truction is more generally known, I &s;hall not take up your time in de&s;cribing them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole the village of Broek, is one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities of the United
<PB N="475" REF="494">Provinces; and, indeed, North-Holland, gene|rally, will be found to ju&s;tify, even more than has been &s;aid in its favour.</P>
<P>The village of Medemblic, which I have not yet mentioned, and which, before the building of Encheu&s;on and Hoorn, was the capital of North-Holland, is &s;till remarkable for its immen&s;e Dams, which have re&s;i&s;ted the violence of the turbulent Zuder Sea &s;o many centuries. The water is here much higher than the land, and in tempe&s;tuous weather threatens to overflow the banks, enormous as they are; by which the country would be in|&s;tantly deluged. To prevent this dreadful event, the inhabitants cover the banks with many folds of &s;ail-cloth, which &s;imple as it ap|pears, checks the fury of the waves in their mo&s;t violent career. A million of human beings tru&s;t their lives to this &s;eemingly &s;light inven|tion. The above adventurous little town looks, as you approach it, to be ju&s;t ri&s;ing out of the ocean: the &s;avage roaring of the waves vainly menace it every moment. When they &s;well be&s;ide the banks, mountain high, ladies are to be &s;een walking and children at play: while the bolde&s;t &s;tranger would tremble for their &s;afety and his own. So reconciling is the power of cu&s;tom. All that you have ever &s;een in your
<PB N="476" REF="495">own country of &s;ublime pier-heads, moles, &amp;c. though they may &s;urpa&s;s in maje&s;ty, fall infinitely &s;hort of the Dam of Medemblic, in point of the terrible, and the indu&s;trious. I have looked down from the heights of Shak|&s;peare's cliff, and from tho&s;e
<Q>"Where huge Plinlimmon lifts his awful head."</Q> but the &s;en&s;ation was in neither in&s;tance &s;o full of tremendous imagery. And the contra&s;t, from the &s;miling and peaceful retirements of Broek, made it more impre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The character of the North Hollander, is that of phlegm and even apathy: He is certainly more &s;aturnine than his countrymen farther &s;outh. Slow in deci&s;ion, per&s;evering in opinion, but un&s;haken, as the banks of Medemblic, in a re&s;olve when taken. They are al&s;o more mu&s;cular in their forms, and of a &s;uperior &s;ize, but neither clum&s;ily put together, nor coar&s;e in their feature. The beauty of the women as to their grand articles of red and white of nature's own putting on (though &s;he mixes them better in &s;ome countries) I have already &s;poken. I have, therefore, only to add, a grace which has been in and out of fa&s;hion, many times on your &s;ide of the water; I mean a very high forehead. The North Holland Ladies con&s;ider
<PB N="477" REF="496">this as &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ible, that they pre&s;s down, and even eradicate the hair, bind it with rib|bons and &s;illets, and u&s;e every other art to expand the brows. A low forehead, and an abundance of hair, near the temples is, of cour&s;e, deemed a grand per&s;onal defect. The females of North Holland, have al&s;o a beauty, which the other Provinces rarely &s;hew us; that of good teeth, which is, in any of the great towns, a rarity in either &s;ex, and &s;eemingly one but little de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Their complexion is almo&s;t invariably fair. A Dutch Brunette, is &s;carce to be &s;een, and when &s;een, not either envied by one &s;ex, or admired by the other. They partake, however, in a very high degree, the defects as well as beauty of that fine colouring&mdash;extreme in|dolence.</P>
<P>We are told that lovers are more con&s;tant, hu&s;bands more ob&s;equious in North Holland, than in any other part of the Republic, which even in general has the reputation of being under the government of the petticoat. This mu&s;t be under&s;tood to extend only to hou&s;e|hold affairs: In matters of public concern, the North Hollander is the mo&s;t independent a&s;&s;erter of his rights, and the Amor Patriae is
<PB N="478" REF="497">here more vitally felt, and has been more &s;trenuou&s;ly maintained, than in any other parts of the Provinces.</P>
<P>Enough, has now been &s;aid to induce every reader of the&s;e our Gleanings, to make the tour of this very &s;ingular and beautiful little Province.</P>
<P>Adieu, my loved friend. Here and every where may ble&s;&s;ings attend you.</P>

<P>Grief, is not more various, my friend, in its cau&s;es, than in its effects upon the minds of different &s;ufferers. There are many who en|dure in a &s;ilence, at once dreadful and pro|found, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tages of their di&s;tre&s;s, and bur&s;t forth into the loude&s;t paroxy&s;ms in the <HI>&s;econd.</HI> And there are others, who <HI>begin</HI> with violence and clamour, which, &s;o far from not remaining in force, decrea&s;es only in &s;ound, but &s;ettles afterwards into a tremendous calm, which remains &s;ixed, for the re&s;t of life, in the melancholy angui&s;h of un&s;peakable de&s;pair. This, I know, inverts the popular idea, that the deepne&s;s of grief, like that of waters,
<PB N="480" REF="499">"makes the lea&s;t noi&s;e," but there is no a&s;cer|taining by a &s;tandard the diver&s;ified effects of agony or joy. Every human being mu&s;t feel in his own way; and, perhaps, no two ever yet felt exactly alike, even the &s;ame pain or plea|&s;ure; becau&s;e temper, con&s;titution, age, &s;ex, or circum&s;tance, with miriads of combina|tions, will make an alteration, &s;ome where or other, in the occa&s;ion, or in the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>I have gleaned the heart of man in many countries, my friend, and though every where, it is true,
<Q><L>"The fle&s;h will quiver where the pincers tear,</L>
<L>"And &s;ighs and tears by nature grow on pain;"</L></Q> as well as that happine&s;s has its general cha|racteri&s;ticks, I do not remember ever, yet, to have found the effects of either&mdash;no, not even when the cau&s;es have been preci&s;ely the &s;ame&mdash; exactly, or even, nearly, &s;imilar, as to the man|ner of receiving them, at fir&s;t, or bearing them afterwards, in any two human creatures.</P>
<P>For my own part, I have been a thou&s;and times &s;atisfied, that our minds are yet more di&s;tinct and appropriate than our per&s;ons, and that no man ever re&s;embled his neighbour &s;o much in the former as the latter. Something
<PB N="481" REF="500">renders each being original; and though we are all of one &s;pecies, were the di&s;&s;imilarities of each individual to be laid open, in a candid hi&s;tory of his peculiar &s;en&s;ations, they would be, perhaps, numerous enough for every mortal to exclaim&mdash;<Q>Although I am of the &s;ame kind, and re&s;emble you, neighbour, in &s;ome things, I differ from you &s;o e&s;&s;entially in others, that 'I am my&s;elf alone': nor do I deny that you may lay claim to like original traits.</Q></P>
<P>I believe, with re&s;pect to the ordinary effects of plea&s;ure and pain, (I am &s;peaking of neither in their extremes) it is common for the fir&s;t to render men voluble, and the latter &s;ilent. I confine my&s;elf to mental, not bodily pain. The rever&s;e happens to my&s;elf. In plea&s;ure, e&s;pe|cially if it be &s;udden, I hardly know what to do with my&s;elf&mdash;a letter which de&s;cribes the health or wealth of an ab&s;ent friend, the conciliation of an enemy, or of any thing <HI>like</HI> conciliation of the latter, the view of a happy countenance, the &s;ound of a happy voice, the &s;miling face of general nature in the &s;pring, diffu&s;ing general felicity, on animal as well as human life, the &s;ight, or even the relation of a generous action, the &s;oft remembrance of kindne&s;s re|ceived in years long pa&s;t, the recollection even of places where I have &s;een, or conver&s;ed with,
<PB N="482" REF="501">tho&s;e whom, though, <HI>perhaps,</HI> I may conver&s;e with, and &s;ee no more, perhaps, I <HI>may:</HI>&mdash;all the&s;e, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and other things, work them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly into the frame of my heart and &s;oul, that I am for a con&s;iderable time ble&s;&s;ed <HI>beyond talking,</HI> and am as re&s;tle&s;s and &s;ilent, as if I was &s;peechle&s;s from di&s;tre&s;s. As the plea&s;urable idea takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, I am driven about in a manner and with a rapidity, that a &s;pectator, ignorant of my habits, would &s;et me down as an unhappy fellow, vainly trying to run away from his mi&s;ery. I cannot &s;it in my chair, nor keep out of it. I even turn from the object (if it be near) from which I derive my felicity. But I turn away frequently with a heart &s;o full of tender gratitude that, even when the object is ina|nimate, (a fine expan&s;e of water or of wood, or a &s;mall rivulet, or a little path way, near, or along which I have wandered, or to which I owe an agreeable image, for my mu&s;e, or for my friend) tho&s;e tears which come from the &s;pring of plea&s;ure gu&s;h to my eyes. It is cer|tainly great happine&s;s, but I can neither tell, nor, at the moment, write about it.</P>
<Q><L>"Mine is the <HI>harve&s;t</HI> dancing in the gale,</L>
<L>"Whatever crowns the hill, or &s;miles along the vale."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="483" REF="502">
Yet till the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;ided, I could not put into the &s;heaf of our corre&s;pondence a &s;ingle wheat-ear.</P>
<P>How different is the influence of plea&s;ure on many whom I have had the delight to &s;ee happy, How has their felicity poured it&s;elf forth in ex|pre&s;&s;ion. How has it made tho&s;e &s;peak, who, in le&s;s fortunate hours, were &s;o profoundly &s;ilent, that
<Q>"they quite dete&s;ted talk."</Q></P>
<P>In grief alone it is, that I am loquacious and yet tranquil. I remain for &s;ome hours fixed, as if &s;tatue-&s;truck, to the &s;pot, where the misfor|tune fell upon me; but, if a friend appears, on that &s;ofte&s;t pillow for an aching heart, I lean for comfort, and explain my feelings without re&s;erve. If no re&s;ource of this kind is at hand, I can, even while the angui&s;h is upon my mind, force it, or, rather &s;hall I &s;ay, indulge it, the only mode of communication which ab&s;ence allows.
<Q>"Heav'n fir&s;t taught letters for &s;ome wretch's aid."</Q> Or I derive con&s;olement from the mu&s;e, and have proved, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, that "flowing numbers" <HI>are</HI> very &s;uitable "with a bleeding heart." If I have ever had the power of intere&s;ting the affections of my reader, in de&s;cribing any imagined &s;orrow, it has always
<PB N="484" REF="503">been when I felt the puncture of &s;ome actual di&s;tre&s;s. And if I have at any time had the happine&s;s to &s;atisfy others, by any &s;train or &s;tory, which painted fancied, or real, felicity, it has been the production of &s;ub&s;equent memory rather than of immediate &s;en&s;ation. I am made happy: the in&s;tant effect does what it will with me, and for &s;ome hours it keeps me in perpetual motion. I think and feel volumes; but I could no more u&s;e a pen than the gander, or goo&s;e, on who&s;e wing it once grew. As the matter &s;ettles a little, I am equal to conver&s;e, or corre&s;pondence: the fitne&s;s for which I fir&s;t gather from perceiving within me the power of talking to my&s;elf. With the return of my &s;o|liloquies, returns al&s;o my colloquial abilities; and, after a few di&s;coveries to my&s;elf, or think|ings aloud, I open upon every per&s;on I meet, chat with every cottager, enter almo&s;t every hut; and, though I am not &s;o violently happy as I was, am, perhaps, more comfortable: to others I certainly am; for during my whirligig, outrageous &s;tate, a cottager would be frightened at me, and a hut &s;carce hold me. Yes, my friend, it is then that I mu&s;t
<Q>"Have ample room and verge enough."</Q></P>
<P>But what am I about? Much of this you know, and have humoured me both when the fit has been on and off, Into what length of
<PB N="485" REF="504">&s;elfi&s;h delineation has the introduction of a little melancholy &s;ong betrayed me? Yet may it not have thrown &s;ome general light on &s;ome commonly received opinions? and, were it only a particular portrait of my own way of feel|ing, &s;urely I may be indulged in a few pages, &s;acred to a friend, who will pardon my egoti&s;m, and &s;mile on my peculiarities.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly they are not the peculiarities of any other man, and therefore can expect to find favour only in the eyes of a friend; unle&s;s every other man would remember, that they too have peculiarities of &s;ome &s;ort, and, perhaps, not many &s;o plea&s;ant to them&s;elves, or &s;o harmle&s;s to other people, as the Gleaner's.</P>
<P>It is thus, that the joyful tidings which open the lips, and put in motion the pens of others, clo&s;e and lay a&s;ide mine. I talk and write, not when I am le&s;s happy, but, when I am in the be&s;t condition to relate: in other words, when I can &s;it &s;till. Not a thought, not an image, however, is impaired. It is even more vivid, and a&s;ks the brighte&s;t colour of language, as well as the &s;peed with which the words that compo&s;e &s;uch language, demand. This letter, dedicated &s;olely to her, who could alone read it, marked as it is with the hurry
<PB N="486" REF="505">that illu&s;trates what I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, &s;hall clo&s;e with a truth that can never change, <HI>viz.</HI> that in every &s;tate of my mind and its feelings; whether I am &s;truck dumb with happine&s;s, or impelled to loquacity, by &s;orrow, I am, with equal affection and fidelity, it's deare&s;t attributes, your's.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Am&s;terdam.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FROM North Holland you return to this city in one of the public barges. It is a pa&s;&s;age of a few hours, at the end of which you revi&s;it tho&s;e &s;cenes of bu&s;tling activity, which are in &s;uch wonderful contra&s;t to tho&s;e images of general repo&s;e, that it &s;eems almo&s;t as if the great ferryman of the Heathens had taken you back in his boat from Ely&s;ium to this nether world. I allude only to the more tran|quil parts of North Holland; &s;uch, for in|&s;tance, as Broek.</P>
<P>In and about that lovely village I have for|got the re&s;idue of the cold weather weeks, and their blu&s;tering attendants, and awaited the
<PB N="487" REF="506">arrival of the &s;pring, who&s;e harbingers have long &s;ince recompen&s;ed the fondne&s;s of expec|tation. I have almo&s;t a month breathed among&s;t all that April has in this country to offer, from the opened violet to the unfolded ro&s;ebud: the tendere&s;t green covers the whole village, which appears almo&s;t to vegetate and blo&s;&s;om. I &s;aid to it ye&s;terday, adieu, and ye&s;terday was one of April's mo&s;t delightful offerings;
<Q><L>"Forth flew the tepid airs, and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>"Unbinding earth, the moving &s;oftne&s;s &s;tray'd."</L></Q></P>
<P>There had been four-and-twenty hours of unu&s;ual warmth, and at length one of tho&s;e &s;howers fell on the earth, which &s;eem to &s;prinkle over it the balms of heaven. One might almo&s;t, without a figure, &s;ay
<Q>"Cele&s;tial odours breath'd around."</Q></P>
<P>On regaining this capital, I could not help exclaiming, in the vigorous language of a mo|dern poet, who &s;eems to have had the true&s;t reli&s;h of nature,
<Q>"God made the country, and man made the town!"</Q></P>
<P>The genial &s;hower above-mentioned, that over&s;pread Brook with flowers and fragrance, had not even quieted the du&s;t of the traffic|trodden city. Man and bea&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the eternal operations of the mop and &s;crub|bing-bru&s;h
<PB N="488" REF="507">in this country, were "be&s;prent." But the clangor of indu&s;try, and the a&s;&s;embled powers of gain, per&s;onified, rendered the change intere&s;ting to the &s;pectator. It is a&s;to|ni&s;hing how the pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e bards of our poetical land, with who&s;e writings I have pa&s;&s;ed my early days, recur to my memory, and break into quotation as occa&s;ions apply them. In an in&s;tant, the appo&s;ite ver&s;es ru&s;h to my lips, whatever be the &s;ubject, and I feel new love and admiration for the author, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting me to illu&s;trate affecting objects with more vivid language than I could my&s;elf &s;upply. As I pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets of Am&s;terdam, from the quay to my lodgings, a pa&s;&s;age from the poet of Nature, who painted the &s;ea&s;ons of the year in colours, inferior only to tho&s;e of nature her&s;elf, broke from me.
<Q><L>"Then would a &s;plendid city ri&s;e to view,</L>
<L>"With cars and carts, and coaches roaring all;</L>
<L>"Wide pour'd abroad, behold the bu&s;tling crew,</L>
<L>"See how they da&s;h along from wall to wall!"</L></Q> But &s;carce had I uttered the&s;e lines ere others, no le&s;s appo&s;ite, from the inexhau&s;tible &s;tores of the &s;ame author, followed them. They exactly characteri&s;e the provinces in general.
<Q><L>"Gay plains extend, where mar&s;hes &s;lept before,</L>
<L>"O'er recent meads th' exulting &s;treamers fly;</L>
<L>"Dark frowning bogs grow bright with Ceres &s;tore,</L>
<L>"And woods embrown the &s;teep, or wave along the &s;hore."</L></Q>
<PB N="489" REF="508">Excu&s;e the variation of a word or two, which brings the picture nearer the truth and the life.</P>
<P>On my going to dine at the Table D'Hote, I met with a circum&s;tance which is too noto|rious not to de&s;erve cen&s;ure, and which, ne|verthele&s;s, Engli&s;h travel-writers have been plea&s;ed, whether from national prejudice, or fal&s;e kindne&s;s, I cannot tell, to pa&s;s over. I &s;peak of the &s;hameful, but very general, prac|tice in &s;trangers, of defaming the country, and the government, and the people, by which they are protected, and with whom they a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>At the public ordinary ju&s;t mentioned, there might be gathered together about forty per|&s;ons of different countries. Not le&s;s than twelve of the&s;e were Engli&s;hmen, chiefly young men e&s;tabli&s;hed in good commercial hou&s;es, for the &s;ake of a reputable connexion in bu&s;ine&s;s, and for a trade-education.</P>
<P>I love my countrymen, for I love my coun|try. But I e&s;teem the one no longer than they do credit to the other. It is at the end of &s;e|veral years patient and &s;ilent ob&s;ervation and di&s;gu&s;t, that I now re&s;olve to mention, with
<PB N="490" REF="509">the mo&s;t marked indignation, a <HI>characteri&s;tic,</HI> and, I am afraid, incorrigible offence to &s;ocial manners, and common decency, perpetually in the practice of <HI>this</HI> cla&s;s of Engli&s;h re&s;idents, in whatever parts of the Continent they are placed.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. They are, beyond compari&s;on, the mo&s;t overbearing part of the company, when they conde&s;cend to talk; and the mo&s;t di&s;obligingly &s;ullen, when they are &s;ilent.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. They get into groupes; and tru&s;ting to the ignorance of the re&s;t of the company in our language, u&s;e it as a &s;ort of ma&s;ked bat|tery, to play off the mo&s;t illiberal ob&s;ervations on the per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;ingled out for the ri|dicule of the hour.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Whatever is the &s;ubject of table-talk, Engli&s;h men, Engli&s;h women, Engli&s;h porter, Engli&s;h punch, Engli&s;h air, fire or water, is &s;uperior to any thing to be found in any other place; and yet by a &s;trange ver&s;atility, when the&s;e very eulogi&s;ts get back into the country they have &s;o beprai&s;ed abroad, they find out that it &s;carce contains any object fit to be borne by a per&s;on who has lived &s;o long in foreign climes. The women are in&s;ipid, the men in|&s;ufferable,
<PB N="491" REF="510">the porter &s;tupifying, the punch vulgar, the air heavy, the fire dull, and the water wor&s;e than that of a canal.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Where a traveller of any other coun|try gets into a &s;crape once, the Engli&s;h youths are under a dozen unplea&s;ant dilemmas, from indecent or intemperate behaviour. Are the Dutch &s;poken of by the&s;e great &s;atiri&s;ts: They are a pack of intere&s;ted, grubbing, heavy|headed &s;coundrels.&mdash;The French: (I &s;peak of France as it u&s;ed to be). They are the mo&s;t faithle&s;s, fawning &s;ycophants.</P>
<P>The Italians: They are dark a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The Spaniards: Proud, poor, ba&s;e, and idle. Thus, catching the popular character (which is com|monly the vulgar error) of each nation, and pre-determined to find the old threadbare &s;lander that &s;ome jaundiced &s;plenetic fir&s;t gave out, they root in them&s;elves the habits of abu&s;e, and &s;acrifice the re&s;t of the univer&s;e to that very old England, which, when they inhabit it, is &s;acrificed, in its turn, to other nations.</P>
<P>It is really afflicting to &s;ee, my dear friend, with what boyi&s;h tricks, and unmanly, as well as ungrateful a&s;per&s;ions, our ex-countrymen
<PB N="492" REF="511">of this order entertain each other. I &s;at op|po&s;ite to &s;ome of this de&s;cription this day, and had the mortification to hear what follows: A French gentleman offered his &s;nuff-box to his next neighbour, a young Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>"Dirty dog!" cried the latter, in a <HI>&s;tage</HI> whi&s;per to his next neighbour, <Q>I won't touch it. The French monkey may want to poi&s;on me for aught I can tell.</Q></P>
<P>A Portugue&s;e gentleman under&s;tanding an Engli&s;h youth, pre&s;ent, had ju&s;t come from Hanover, begged to know the route&mdash; "D&mdash;n the yellow-faced fellow's imperti|nence," cried the Briti&s;h hero to his comrade, <Q>I know he can't &s;peak a word of Engli&s;h, and &s;o I won't under&s;tand him.</Q> This ami|able ob&s;ervation produced a loud laugh among&s;t the Engli&s;hmen, and the Portugue&s;e was put out of countenance, but not out of manners. "I pre&s;ume," &s;aid he, bowing, <Q>that Mon&s;ieur does not under&s;tand my bad Engli&s;h; and as I have not the honour to &s;peak good French, I can only regret that I mu&s;t lo&s;e the benefit of his information.</Q> Hereupon the gentleman left the room, and the Engli&s;h|men laughed louder than before.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="512">Is it not very uncomfortable to &s;ee our&s;elves thus generally outdone in all the conciliating courte&s;ies of life? On my honour, I adhere to the &s;imple&s;t facts, when I again a&s;&s;ert, that a native of this, and of almo&s;t every country I have pa&s;&s;ed, will attend to every que&s;tion you plea&s;e to a&s;k&mdash;an&s;wer it the mo&s;t &s;atisfactorily in his power,&mdash;li&s;ten to the mo&s;t irrelevant and prolix conver&s;ations, in which you choo&s;e to addre&s;s him; go out of his own path to &s;et you right in your's; hear the feeble&s;t attempts to explain your&s;elf in his language; and &s;o far from ridiculing your deficiency, try to &s;upply, by gue&s;&s;ing your wi&s;hes, through all the defects of your expre&s;&s;ion, and be your air, manner, motions, or dre&s;s, the mo&s;t obnoxious to ridicule in the world, you will never &s;ee or hear any odious compari&s;ons, or national triumphs.</P>
<P>You know me too perfectly to believe I would in&s;inuate, that the rever&s;e of this de|meanour is univer&s;ally prevailing in Briti&s;h travellers abroad, or re&s;idents at home, but it is lamentably general; and I have felt my cheek burn with indignation and &s;hame at it, in various countries.</P>
<P>"Reform it altogether," I beg of you, my young countrymen; &s;ince although the good
<PB N="494" REF="513">breeding of tho&s;e you treat thus ungenerou&s;ly prevents them from recriminating, they &s;e|cretly feel all the contempt for you which &s;uch conduct excites, and it impre&s;&s;es on their minds an indelible idea of the coar&s;ene&s;s, buf|foonery, and inho&s;pitality of the Briti&s;h nation.
<Q>"What can they rea&s;on but from what they know."</Q> And as they may never go into England to vin|dicate it from the&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and may perhaps avoid mixing with mere Engli&s;h tra|vellers, after the fir&s;t in&s;ults have been re|ceived, you are in effect a depreciator of your country, and &s;candalize it in the eyes and in the e&s;timate of every other!</P>
<P>But enough of this: and enough of Am&s;ter|dam. The lovely &s;ea&s;on invites me to range abroad, farther a-field, and in my irregular, but, I hope, not unplea&s;ant way, to glean other places. My purpo&s;e is now to go once again higher up the country; again to traver&s;e the-plea&s;ant regions of Guelderland; to circle We&s;tphalia, to penetrate into Germany, and, in all, to
<Q>"Try what the open, what the coverts yield,"</Q> I invite you to accompany me with my whole affectionate heart.</P>
<P>Come then, my friend, my genius, come along, and may every good and plea&s;ant thing attend us on the way.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AND the way is literally &s;trewed over with flowers. A journey through Holland in that part of the year, when
<Q><L>"Nature all</L>
<L>"Is blooming and benevolent like thee."</L></Q> is a journey, or rather a voyage, for you go by water, by the &s;ide of a garden, in which nature has done all the &s;oil allows, and art has &s;upplied her deficiencies as far as it is po&s;&s;ible. But it is a very curious, and glean-worthy matter, to &s;ee as you go on higher land, how art declines, and nature a&s;&s;erts her&s;elf; I mean as to vegetable beauties. Indu&s;try and toil, who&s;e &s;trong and ingenious hands have wrought &s;uch wonders in the Provinces of Holland, Utrecht, &amp;c. appear to be mere lookers on in neighbouring places. The flat but flouri&s;hing lowland, gradually ri&s;es to an hillock, the hillock &s;wells to a hill, and the hill &s;preads, as you pa&s;s onward, to a mountain; the regular alley of trees yields to the luxuriant hedge rows, the&s;e give place to the &s;ublimer woodland, and that is &s;ucceeded by the almo&s;t immea&s;urable fore&s;ts: the &s;low
<PB N="496" REF="515">&s;mooth canals of Holland improve into the running brooks of Guelderland, the&s;e expand to the ample lakes of the adjoining countries, and the various &s;cene is clo&s;ed by the &s;tupendous cataracts of Switzerland. Different pro&s;pects! and a different people! but a Supreme Being pre&s;ides over each, and has extended his benignity to all. Let us then
<Q>"Etch the pro&s;pect as it lies."</Q></P>
<P>Re&s;pecting Dordrecht, Gorcum, Breda, Bergen-op-zoom, &amp;c. I mu&s;t beg leave to refer you to the numerous books, in which they are very ju&s;tly de&s;cribed, and in none better than in Peckam. I am anxious to go on with you, to the faire&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Dutch Republic, over and acro&s;s which, I am com|petent to be your guide, on the ground of long experience, having traver&s;ed the country of Guelderland&mdash;certainly entitled to the epithet of the faire&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;&s;everal times, and at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year.</P>
<P>We will ju&s;t &s;top by the way, to glean an anecdote from Dordht. At that town, is a very curious, and I believe, hitherto unpubli&s;hed cu&s;tom, in regard to the German timber-mer|chants. The&s;e men having prepared and &s;ea&s;oned their wood, come down upon it along
<PB N="497" REF="516">bo&s;oms of the Rhine and Mai&s;e. It forms a train of immen&s;e rafts, &s;imply tied together, and on the &s;urface of the&s;e planks, they erect temporary habitations for the accommodation of them&s;elves and families. Thus they &s;wim down from the high to the low countries, to &s;ell their timber; for which, on their arrival at Dort, they have a certain market. This traffic is an amu&s;ing novelty; for, in defiance of wind, waves, or weather, all ages and &s;exes from the cradled infants to the great grand|fathers, are on float. But the be&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is, that the&s;e itinerant Germans, hav|ing vended their &s;tores and converted their rafts into good Dutch ducats, &s;eem to for|get they have any other habitation or country, &s;ince they generally continue to idle about till tho&s;e ducats, in&s;tead of making the tour of Germany, remain, by the medium of inn|keepers, in Dutch land, as if unwilling to emi|grate from their native country, or to tarry with the German timber-merchants, many of whom, having &s;pent the la&s;t &s;tiver in this &s;trolling way, often repair them&s;elves by marrying &s;ome pretty Dutch-woman who can pay their pa&s;&s;age back to the German fore&s;ts; where they hew timber with great indu&s;try, till the &s;ea&s;on of idlene&s;s again arrives.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="517">Of the Duchy of Guelderland I have in a former letter given you a general character. But our particular attention is due to its prin|cipal towns; the&s;e are Arnheim and Nimeguen, who&s;e environs and appertaining villages will employ the lovers of natural and artificial beauties, with many a day of plea&s;ant ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The interior parts of this very agreeable Duchy, are among&s;t the many things &s;lighted by po&s;t-ha&s;te travellers. Nimeguen, indeed, one of its capitals, as being in the direct route of We&s;tphalia and Germany, forces it&s;elf upon the notice of the mo&s;t rapid traveller, who, <HI>therefore,</HI> informs you that it is a rich, ancient, and populous town; that the market-place, and &s;treet to which it belongs, is remarkable for its extent, and the elegance of the &s;urrounding buildings, e&s;pecially the church towers and &s;teeples of St. Etienne, by which it is termi|nated. The town-hou&s;e, al&s;o, being among&s;t the palpable objects, is de&s;cribed, by the heroes of the whip and &s;pur, as a magnificent &s;tructure, ornamented with the &s;tatues of the emperors; and la&s;tly, we gather from the &s;ame ha&s;ty authors, that the garri&s;on is in con&s;iderable force, in the be&s;t repair, and that it is worth a &s;tranger's while, who has time to &s;pare, and is
<PB N="499" REF="518">not fatigued with his journey, to take a &s;troll round the bulwarks, while the kettle is boiling, or the beef-&s;teak dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I can witne&s;s the truth of all this, but he who mounts his hor&s;e, or throws him&s;elf into his carriage, with having &s;een only the&s;e &s;taring objects, and then da&s;hing right on without turning to the right or to the left, enriched as both &s;ides are, with charming little villages and countries, will lo&s;e what is well worth looking for. Of the&s;e, however, in their place.</P>
<P>Nimeguen is celebrated in the hi&s;tory of modern Europe, for being the place where the Congre&s;s of Plenipotentiaries a&s;&s;embled to conclude the treaty of peace, in 1678, between Spain, France, and the United Provinces, Augu&s;t 10th; and between the Empire and France, and the Empire and Sweden, on the 3d of Feb. 1679. The mediators on the part of the Pope and Great Britain, were Moi&s;e Bevilagua, Patriarch of Alexandria, Lord Berkley and Temple. The amba&s;&s;adors of the Emperor were the Count de Goes, Bi&s;hop of Gurck; and the Counts de Kin&s;ki and Straetman. Tho&s;e of Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, and the United States, were men of equal rank and abilities.
<PB N="500" REF="519">We find the eminent name of Colbert among&s;t the repre&s;entatives of France.</P>
<P>The Nimeguens, in con&s;equence of this meet|ing, had the addre&s;s to procure for their town more &s;olid advantages than are derived from the empty di&s;tinction of the &s;igning a treaty of peace, even though of importance to Europe. The States-General contrived to ratify the &s;aid treaty by &s;etting on foot a &s;ub&s;cription, which was &s;oon filled by the a&s;&s;embled parties, to repair the injuries they had contributed to bring upon the town, at the &s;iege which it &s;u&s;tained a few years before. By this means, a demand of fifty-five million of florins, which this town mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have paid by &s;tipu|lation to the French, was done away.</P>
<P>Numerous are the readers who would be &s;urprized, were I to a&s;&s;ure them, that the part of the Dutch territory, known by the name of Guelderland, is replete with not only the beau|tiful, but the &s;ublime of nature, that the lovelie&s;t vallies are under &s;helter of the mo&s;t magnificent hills, that the&s;e extend in a chain which &s;ome|times is bathed in the clouds, from one end of the Province to the other; the mo&s;t romantic foliage and &s;cenery luxuriating above, and a delicious branch of the Meu&s;e, or of the Rhine,
<PB N="501" REF="520">flowing beneath&mdash;the intermediate vallies and plains, on a dry, elevated, and plentiful &s;oil, filled with flocks, herds, and game, and en|riched by towns, villas, ca&s;tles, and hamlets, that, to a well-tempered traveller, would give the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, to perceive, with what an equal hand, the God of Nature has been the God of all; and to even a grudging traveller mu&s;t extort a confe&s;&s;ion, that it is not for Pro|vidence to copy the vices of &s;elfi&s;h mortals, but for &s;elfi&s;h mortals to imitate the bounties of Providence. For my own part, I confe&s;s to you, I never look at the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed on my fellow creatures in a foreign land, without feel|ing my heart at once enlarged and bettered by the view. I have a feeling on this &s;ubject, I anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h I could de&s;cribe to you, but the &s;en&s;ation is too &s;trong for language; at lea&s;t for my powers of de&s;cription. In traver&s;ing a new country, as its beauties ri&s;e to my view, I con&s;ider each of tho&s;e beauties as &s;o many fre&s;h arguments for my admiration of the great and good be&s;tower: I con&s;ider a traveller as having even better opportunities than other men to become conver&s;ant with his beneficent works. Warmed with this idea, I have looked at with ardent eyes, and felt with an adoring heart, the &s;urrounding &s;cenes. I have all my life read and heard of the high enjoyment derived from
<PB N="502" REF="521">the idea of property; &s;imply, and indepen|dently, of the real comforts, or benefits, which &s;uch property affords. I have been told of the exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction, with which a man walks over a &s;pacious garden, or an exten&s;ive mea|dow, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their being upon his own ground; and I have been informed, likewi&s;e, that the human heart warms with more chearing influence among&s;t the flowers, fruits, and other rural charms, that are di&s;played in that &s;oil where it fir&s;t began to beat, than in any other clime. Of the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, I know nothing. I have never been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fine fields, or gardens, except as a mere yearly renter; and, therefore, cannot &s;peak to the wonderful delights, that are &s;aid to proceed from the commanding idea, that I was Lord of the land, the fruits, the flowers, the herds, the flocks, &amp;c. &amp;c. Nor have I re&s;ted long enough in the place, or nation that gave me birth; nor been &s;ufficiently happy in it, to make me think with &s;ome, (I &s;u&s;pect affected) patriots, that even mi&s;ery and inconvenience at home, are better than comfort and accom|modation abroad. Yet I am not in&s;en&s;ible, on general principles, to the plea&s;ing reflection that my countrymen re&s;ide in a fair land, that it is ju&s;tly celebrated for arts and arms, and protected by whole&s;ome laws. Neither, on
<PB N="503" REF="522">particular principles, am I without a fond con|&s;olation, that the friends, from whom fate or fortune &s;eparates me, enjoy all the above privileges, added to the fame and di&s;tinction which their own talents or virtues &s;ecure. But this is too broad a &s;atisfaction to give me the &s;en&s;ation of having a landed intere&s;t in that country, and luxuriating in the idea that I am the proprietor of &s;o many thou&s;and of its acres. I fear, unle&s;s I were to <HI>liberalize</HI> this &s;en&s;ation, by &s;uppo&s;ing it aro&s;e chiefly from the idea &s;uch ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions gave of a&s;&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e who had more cau&s;e to thank nature than fortune&mdash; I fear, I &s;ay, my dear friend, that unle&s;s I were to &s;uppo&s;e this, which I doubt would be &s;omewhat too candid, that to de&s;cend to the feeling of valuing a tree, a park, a garden, or any other natural beauty, becau&s;e, by purcha&s;e or birth-right, it was my <HI>own,</HI> I mu&s;t very much <HI>narrow</HI> my pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations. As it is, I a&s;cend the mountains at home or abroad, and &s;ee from them, with real joy, the &s;miles of nature, the riches of indu&s;try, or wonders of art, which, I hope, render tens of thou&s;ands as happy as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>If half of them are as plea&s;ed with the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion as I with the pro&s;pect they are delighted indeed. It never enters into my mind&mdash;<HI>the&s;e
<PB N="504" REF="523">are not mine</HI>&mdash;a thought which is enough to darken the &s;un, and envelope the whole &s;cene. I even derive gratification from knowing that the view which at the moment regales me, is only a &s;peck, a &s;pan, in the great &s;y&s;tem of human felicity, or, at lea&s;t, the materials of felicity. I pa&s;s the boundary of this ample pro&s;pect, but find no boundary to the felicity. Other &s;cenes, another people to enjoy them, but an equal abundance of the materials. I expand my re&s;earch yet further, and find &s;till rea&s;on to congratulate human nature, and my&s;elf as &s;pectator of the various good appointed for it. I look into a fine territory, and hail the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of it. I &s;urvey a maje&s;tic wood, and &s;o far from appropriating a &s;ingle twig or leaf of it, I am grateful to the owner, for cultivating it. I love it for it&s;elf, and I love it for the God that made it &s;o fair. If imagination &s;ome|times creates a fore&s;t, or a flower of her own, or builds me up a man&s;ion, or (as I have &s;omewhere el&s;e &s;aid) places me a cottage in any country I am gleaning, and puts into it what furniture and what inhabitants &s;he knows her votary be&s;t approves, that is quite another matter, and that is certainly poetical <HI>property;</HI> but for coveting other men's goods, in any other way, or in any other place, through all the works of created nature, I never did, nor
<PB N="505" REF="524">ever &s;hall. And I do not believe I could walk in the grounds of an enemy, &s;ee his flowers in bloom, or his fruits in bearing, without pluck|ing a canker from the one, or a &s;lug from the other, if I found them in my way.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be your <HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI> in Guelderland, my friend. If the vapours of Holland, and her low lands &s;hould have relaxed your frame, or &s;eized your &s;pirits, here you may brace theone, and in|vigorate the other. Deviate into the &s;eque&s;tered paths and you will be delighted with clu&s;tering villages that make directly to the heart, by the medium of peculiar neatne&s;s and &s;implicity; for here nature begins to re&s;ume her&s;elf; in Holland &s;he was often obliged to yield to art. If you keep the direct roads, they will guide you to many noble towns, and highly orna|mented countries. In either path, I repeat, ble&s;&s;ed may you be.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the main roads will take you to Arnheim; a town which rivals Nimeguen in beauty, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es it in &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="506" REF="525">It is a pretty curious fact, that a &s;tranger cannot come into this place, or go out of it, without paying for his exit and entrance. In the &s;pace of half a league, there are half a dozen bridges rai&s;ed over as many canals. At each of the&s;e you pay pa&s;&s;age money; the fir&s;t takes a half-penny, the &s;econd a penny, and &s;o on in a ri&s;ing &s;eries; the &s;ixth payment carries you to the great gate, at which you are &s;topped by a worthy per&s;on who has another demand on you: and whether on foot, or on hor&s;eback, or in a carriage, you mu&s;t pay your quota. As this was the fir&s;t time I had been a&s;ked to pay for the u&s;e of my legs, I thought it worth while to glean the rea&s;on, and was told that I had the honour to pay at all the&s;e bridges, for the good of the Republic, and by order of the States. I bowed and pa&s;&s;ed on to my hotel, where I had &s;carce time to felicitate my&s;elf on having contributed my mite to the Republic ere mine ho&s;t of the Golden Eagle, (the be&s;t inn of Arnheim), pre&s;ented me with a book and pen, to announce my name, quality, object of travel, how long I purpo&s;ed to remain in town, and which of its inhabitants could &s;peak to my character. By the bye, all the&s;e demands are made in Dutch, and if your landlord can|not interpret, you mu&s;t make it out as you can,
<PB N="507" REF="526">for your an&s;wer to every que&s;tion mu&s;t be given in to the magi&s;trates, early the next morning. The interrogatories here are.</P>
<P>De Naam?</P>
<P>Woonplaats?</P>
<P>Qualiteit of Beroep?</P>
<P>Van waar gekoomen?</P>
<P>Hoe lang blyve?</P>
<P>By wie hier of Elders in de Provintie bekend?</P>
<P>This being a pretty general cu&s;tom on the Continent, I &s;hould not have noticed it but for the abruptne&s;s with which it was done; and being &s;omewhat weary, I wi&s;hed to get a quiet di&s;h of tea, before I wrote down my hi&s;tory; unle&s;s, &s;aid I to the landlord, you &s;hould be of opinion it may be for the good of the Republic, and the States-General, that I &s;hould give an account of my&s;elf before. The Republic, an&s;wered mine ho&s;t, is always happy to receive &s;trangers, and to know who they are, what they come for, how long they remain, and where they are going; and the &s;ooner the chief magi&s;trates are made acquainted with all this the better. Then my information &s;hall be conci&s;e, complete, and immediate. I come to pick up what I can find in other countries, and carry it off to my own. I have already gone
<PB N="508" REF="527">half the world over with the like view; and, before I get home, &s;hall perhaps traver&s;e the other half. There was &s;omething in this ac|count which my landlord did not like. He fa&s;tened a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion on the declaration, that I was come to pick up and carry off what I could find. But in the cour&s;e of the evening, a gentleman of the place, to whom I was known, cleared me up to the good man's &s;ati&s;|faction, and he afterwards made ample amends for his over-ha&s;ty &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>He told me what was worthy of remark, both in his town and neighbourhood. He ad|verti&s;ed me of a book, in which were &s;et down and printed the prices of baggage, carriages, boats, and po&s;t-hor&s;es, by which extortion was rendered impo&s;&s;ible. He told me I was within a day's walk or morning ride of &s;everal very beautiful villas, and he ordered his little &s;on to write me down, as well a direction to, as a de&s;cription of the&s;e: <Q>When you have got out of the town-gate,</Q> &s;aid the little fellow, <Q><HI>you will &s;ee</HI> a long avenue of trees, which you mu&s;t walk under, and <HI>when you get</HI> to the end of this long avenue, <HI>you will &s;ee</HI> two roads, you mu&s;t take the left, and <HI>when you have</HI> walked another quarter of an hour, you will &s;ee a fine inn, and on the other
<PB N="509" REF="528">&s;ide of this fine inn <HI>you will &s;ee</HI> Claarembeck, and then another quarter of an hour, and <HI>you will &s;ee</HI> Angle&s;tein; and <HI>when you have got</HI> to Angle&s;tein, then go &s;traight forward till you come to Ron&s;indale, where there is another good inn, from whence you have but a &s;hort walk to Belljoen; and when you &s;ee Belljoen, you &s;hould go to the inn called the Brouverye, and there you will learn the way to Backheu&s;en, which is the mo&s;t beau|tiful of all.</Q> My in&s;tructor was but eight years old; and though his account was &s;ome|thing like, "Walk in, gentlemen, <HI>and &s;ee what you &s;hall &s;ee,"</HI> it was done with &s;o hearty a good|will, and &s;o many apologies for bad French, and &s;o well-natured an offer of his little &s;elf, to prevent my &s;uffering by his ignorance, that it abundantly atoned for the behaviour of his father on my fir&s;t coming into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My young director, however, who had more of the French courte&s;y (I &s;peak of France when it was a nation) than of the French lan|guage, made a &s;mall mi&s;take in putting the word <HI>gauche,</HI> where he &s;hould have written <HI>droit,</HI> by which I was carried a good hour's walk out of my track, and for which I return him my hearty thanks, being thereby con|ducted into &s;ome of the mo&s;t delightful bye|walks,
<PB N="510" REF="529">nooks, and corners of nature. I might have driven along the main road for a month together, without &s;o much as &s;u&s;pecting tho&s;e &s;weetly-&s;eque&s;tered beauties were &s;o near at hand.</P>
<P>And now, my good reader, if, peradventure, thou art, like my&s;elf, ma&s;ter of thy time, and a deliberate traveller, let me &s;ugge&s;t to thee the &s;upreme &s;atisfaction of now and then lo&s;ing thy way; &s;ince to &s;uch accidents thou wilt &s;ometimes find, at every devious &s;tep, a rich reward for thy wanderings. Indeed I would advi&s;e thee (where the general cour&s;e, &s;itua|tion, and pro&s;pect of a country in&s;ures thee a beauty of nature go were thou wilt) to ride or walk, contrary to the in&s;tructions thou maye&s;t have received, incontinently turning to the right when thou art de&s;ired to keep the left, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> If thou ha&s;t never tried, there is no convincing thee of the enchanting &s;cenes which a dull regular right-on journey makes thee pa&s;s. For my own part, being, as thou ha&s;t &s;een, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e gleanings, in the habit of holding long and audible conver|&s;ations with my&s;elf, when perhaps there is neither an human creature, nor the habitation of one within a league of me, and when warmly engaged in the que&s;tion and an&s;wer of &s;uch
<PB N="511" REF="530">&s;elf-&s;u&s;tained dialogues, I often take the left for right, and the right without knowing it. My di&s;cour&s;e, however, being u&s;ually on the beauties of nature, I lo&s;e none of them by the&s;e errors, but am upon the whole a gainer. It is true I have frequently been benighted, but then I have found an inn, a public hou&s;e, or a private one, or a cot, and all the&s;e have commonly been prolific of adventures either for good or evil, or a mixture of both: new &s;cenes have pre&s;ented them&s;elves; new charac|ters; in the cour&s;e of the next day I have got by &s;ome other cut (which is another novelty) into the main road. I glean every inch of the way, and on coming home, add &s;omething to my &s;heaf: Or, if you &s;hould &s;tray <HI>very</HI> far out of the beaten path, you will always meet &s;ome|body good-natured enough to &s;hew you the way back. For in&s;tance: by the mi&s;direction of my little guide, I deviated a league. I heard the &s;ound of an axe in the middle of a fore&s;t, ju&s;t at the opening of four different great roads cut through the &s;aid fore&s;t. I took that from whence the &s;ound &s;eemed to come. But the &s;ound &s;oon led me through numberle&s;s verdant difficulties, and lea&s;y la|byrinths, which, though far from being un|plea&s;ant, conveyed me to the thicke&s;t parts of
<PB N="512" REF="531">the wood. On a &s;udden, the &s;ound of the axe cea&s;ed, and I was without any guide at all;
<Q><L>"Where woods immea&s;urably &s;pread</L>
<L>"Seem'd length'ning as I went."</L></Q> I wandered about for &s;ome time, before I re|collected that could I occa&s;ion a &s;ound, as well as the axe. I rai&s;ed my voice to its extent. Had I whi&s;pered, it mu&s;t have been heard, for, within a few paces, the woodman who had been felling timber was &s;itting upon a tree he had ju&s;t cut down; and converting it both into a &s;eat and table, was eating his mid-day meal: this con&s;i&s;ted of very dark brown bread, a bunch of radi&s;hes, and a lump of chee&s;e; of all which he invited me to partake, and in a manner that to refu&s;e would have been churli&s;h. Be&s;ides, I had rambled about, like the babes of the wood, till I was hungry. After my repa&s;t, the ho&s;pitable forre&s;ter, with an urbanity that would have thrown lu&s;tre on the dweller in a palace, conducted me to the &s;ide of the wood; and there, not having &s;ufficient confidence in his explanations, or in the &s;pecimens I gave of a knowledge in his language, he took my cane, (which, however, he returned with a bow almo&s;t in the &s;ame moment, as if &s;en&s;ible he had, in a manner, committed an outrage on his former courte&s;y) then u&s;ing his fingers as
<PB N="513" REF="532">a compa&s;s, he drew a correct map of my route upon the &s;and; by means of which I was as perfect a ma&s;ter of the geography of my in|tended excur&s;ion, as if Cooke, Kitchen, or Sanby, tho&s;e celebrated mappi&s;ts, had made out my chart.</P>
<P>There was &s;o much natural good-will, and good-breeding in the &s;ervices of this man of the woods, that as he drew the lines of direc|tion, my heart warmed towards him. I gave my hand to rai&s;e him from the ground, on which he kneeled to draw his in&s;tructions; and as I bade him adieu, I felt that comfort|le&s;s &s;en&s;ation which has &s;o often accompanied me in my journey through the world, when I have taken leave of the kind and courteous, whom accident has thrown into my path, but whom the chances are again&s;t my ever meet|ing again. The longe&s;t pa&s;&s;age of life is &s;hort, and one &s;ees, in travelling it, many objects, and catch glimp&s;es of many per&s;ons, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> to who&s;e countenances, conver&s;e, and other charms, we mu&s;t bid, mo&s;t likely an eternal, farewell, ju&s;t as they begin to intere&s;t and de|light us. But the plea&s;ure of &s;uch encounters, tran&s;itory as they are, have a &s;weetne&s;s that &s;oftens the regret of our not being able to
<PB N="514" REF="533">enjoy it long. My advice, therefore, is, in ca&s;es of travel, the rever&s;e of that given in ca&s;es of morality. In the latter, we are very properly admoni&s;hed to reject the crooked paths which lead to vice, even though &s;trewed with ro&s;es, and to per&s;i&s;t in the &s;traight road which conducts to virtue, though &s;urrounded by thorns. But in a journey purely to &s;ee the world, "and all that it inherits," my exhor|tation is, that you quit the broad right-on way, and take the winding one. For in&s;tance, had&s;t thou, my friend, in the deviations of half a day, met nothing more than the man of the wood, would he not have more than paid thee for thy wanderings.</P>
<P>Certainly I have, in my perambulations of this day, received as much vernal plea&s;ure, and in as great variety, as the mo&s;t ardent lover of nature could defire. I performed the tour, my obliging little guide had de&s;cribed, infinitely to my &s;atisfaction; and, on my regaining Arnheim, was ju&s;t as fatigued as is con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;ound and quiet re&s;t.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e with all the fre&s;hne&s;s of the morning; and yet I feel my&s;elf at a lo&s;s how to make you a partaker of my gratified heart; having,
<PB N="515" REF="534">as you know, a &s;ettled di&s;like to all formal ac|counts: 
<Q>"Where pure de&s;cription holds the place of &s;en&s;e."</Q> And yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s over a &s;eries of very beautiful &s;cenery, without &s;aying &s;ome|thing.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, however, you are to ob&s;erve, that the country it&s;elf (I mean this part of Guelder|land) does not admit of tho&s;e elevations or de&s;cents which character the land betwixt Nimeguen and Utrecht. You meet, in the en|virons of Arnheim, no cataracts, which, im|patient of controul, bur&s;t their way through a thou&s;and fi&s;&s;ures of the rocks: you perceive no mountains which give you all the changing &s;ea&s;ons as you a&s;cend them. At their ba&s;e, the &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;pring, in their centre a glowing &s;ummer, and on their &s;ummit a rigo|rous winter. But you have abundance of tho&s;e graceful ri&s;ings and fallings, that, by the help of a little art, afford you many charming land&s;capes. Travellers of every de&s;cription will, in the walk I have taken, find amu&s;ement and delight, from the ri&s;ing even to the &s;etting of the &s;un: here are pictures for the painter and the bard. In each of the places is the happie&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of the evergreens, and the whole view is enriched by cottages, convents,
<PB N="516" REF="535">churches, mills, and turrets: hu&s;bandmen and women at work; children &s;pread over the ground in &s;port, &s;heep at pa&s;ture: blo&s;&s;oms of all colours, flowers of all fragrance; the Rhine flowing on one &s;ide, the Mae&s;e on the other, with numberle&s;s intermediate &s;treams, brooks, and rivulets, meandring through the verdure. To the&s;e the poet would be able to de&s;cribe, in his numbers, what cannot be &s;o forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by the ma&s;ter of the pencil; the harmony of nightingales, which are even in flights throughout Guelderland. Indeed, they are here too numerous for poetry; for they echo each other in &s;uch rapid re&s;pon&s;es, and the charm is &s;o ince&s;&s;ant, that a young votary of the mu&s;e would have more Philomelas than he knew well how to manage. Indeed they are, in this country, in too great quantity for a pro&s;eman; for the note of one runs into that of a &s;econd, the &s;econd into a third, and &s;o on, that they put each other out of tune, and produce rather a clamour than a concord. I think, verily, I heard in this little tour as many of the&s;e cele|brated &s;ong&s;ters, as would have added a nightingale to half the groves of Great Britain. Nor would travellers, of a tender complexion, fail to find &s;omething in keeping with their feeling. There are bowers of mo&s;s, arbours of the thicke&s;t verdure, and hermitage of the
<PB N="517" REF="536">profounde&s;t &s;eque&s;tration: and if, peradven|ture, as in parties of plea&s;ure &s;uch painful things occur, any two per&s;ons, whether of the &s;ame or of a different &s;ex, whether &s;ingle or married, wi&s;h for the relief of a little ab&s;ence from each other, it is but taking the right path, when the other goes to the left, (for they are very artfully connected, &s;o as to render the &s;eparation unperceived) and I will en&s;ure to both the felicity of at lea&s;t an hour's re&s;pite from the &s;malle&s;t hazard of their coming near each other.</P>
<P>In this general de&s;cription I include the general beauties of the &s;everal places, already mentioned as the objects of my ambulation, <HI>viz.</HI> Clarembec, Ro&s;indale, Belljoin, and Bac|heu&s;en. A few particulars mu&s;t, however, be noted. The dwelling-hou&s;e of Ro&s;indale (who&s;e other beauties are &s;o manyfold, and in &s;uch good ta&s;te) has its foundation in water, not a running &s;tream, not a flowing river, but a filthy, di&s;coloured, &s;tanding pool&mdash;a fault common to the very be&s;t hou&s;es, and even pa|laces of the Republic: and what is &s;tranger &s;till, con&s;idered as an advantage. I might mention, too, as a counterpart to this, the mi&s;|&s;hapen and <HI>outr&eacute;</HI> paintings of gods and god|de&s;&s;es, fi&s;h and game, fruit and &s;hell-work, in
<PB N="518" REF="537">one of the mo&s;t &s;pacious pavilions of the &s;aid Ro&s;indale. This pavilion is al&s;o ornamented, or, if you plea&s;e, onerated with urns and va&s;es, and &s;tatues &s;o ill afforted, and &s;o clo&s;e together, that it has rather the air of a &s;tone-ma&s;on's or &s;tatuary's &s;hop and warehou&s;e, than of a nobleman's &s;ummer-hou&s;e. But, indeed, all Dutch embelli&s;hments exhibit a fal&s;e ta&s;te and clum&s;y genius. At Bacheu&s;en, however, are objects that would find their way to your "heart of hearts." From a path almo&s;t open to an exten&s;ive country, you enter into a grove of evergreens, which, by a very &s;kilful gradation, take a deeper hue in your progre&s;s. The fir&s;t five or &s;ix hundred yards the foliage is of young fir, which gives a tender kind of &s;hade, at the end of which the path begins to darken, the trees (which are &s;till of fir, but of greater age) being more lofty and venerable. Pre|&s;ently you come to a double, then a treble, row of the&s;e on each &s;ide. About a quarter of a mile farther on, the &s;hade becomes &s;o thick, that twilight overtakes you. You are alarmed; your &s;tep is awed; you li&s;ten. The wind blowing through the firs, in &s;uch a place, gives the &s;ound of heavy, human &s;ighing, when, urged by a wi&s;h to regain the day, and pre&s;&s;ing onward, you are precipitated into an aby&s;s &s;o profound, and are &s;urrounded by &s;uch
<PB N="519" REF="538">melancholy foliage, as wraps you in almo&s;t utter darkne&s;s, even in the noon of day. The trees, in this part, are cypre&s;s, the growth of &s;everal centuries, and the underwood below is of the dunne&s;t &s;hrubs, &s;o interwoven, as to ex|clude the light. You are thus in "the dark|ne&s;s that may be <HI>felt,"</HI> from which, however, a few minutes walking relieves you. You come into a path, where the &s;ame artful ar|rangement of foliage, which had excluded the &s;un-beams, is u&s;ed to re&s;tore them. The greens are at fir&s;t only <HI>&s;omewhat</HI> le&s;s dark, the livelier &s;hades &s;ucceed&mdash;the tints &s;often apace, the day returns, and you are touched by an emotion too mighty and &s;ingular for the pen, at lea&s;t for that of your affectionate friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>TO the beauteous country, which in|cludes the&s;e attracting &s;pots, I &s;hould tell you, that you may be conducted by land or water, each of which has its peculiar charm. Your route by the former is Harwick, Helveot&s;luice, Rotter|dam, and Nimeguen. By the latter, you em|bark
<PB N="520" REF="539">at Rotterdam, and are carried on the bo&s;om of the Mae&s;e, even to the places de|&s;cribed; your pa&s;&s;age to which in the &s;ummer|time is replete with beautiful &s;cenery: but let me apprize you of the nece&s;&s;ity there is to go by the public barges, and not in one of the private bye-trading boats. It is the more e&s;|&s;ential for you to know this, as there are per|&s;ons at the water's edge lying in wait to lite|rally <HI>take you in,</HI> under pretence of their &s;ailing directly. Your being &s;educed, by this appear|ance of accommodation, may &s;ubject you to numberle&s;s inconveniences; be&s;ides paying for them double the money, which, in the vulgar boats, would be demanded of you for the be&s;t treatment.</P>
<P>Having mentioned Rotterdam, I will here offer you two circum&s;tances, which, though gleaned long &s;ince, were omitted, when I gave you a particular account of that populous place.</P>
<P>I was there on the 8th of March, the day which is commemorated as the anniver&s;ary of the Stadtholder's birth. If external &s;igns were always expre&s;&s;ive of the fact, a tra|veller would pre&s;ume that the Prince of Orange is beloved of his people beyond any other potentate of the earth, taking the
<PB N="521" REF="540">&s;hew of his natal day as a proof of it. For, be&s;ides the common ceremonies of firing guns, and other compliments of cour&s;e, civil or military emblems of loyalty were di&s;played, wherever invention, and even whim, could hang them out. All the ve&s;&s;els were full dre&s;&s;ed, fore, aft, and mid&s;hip, in their holiday finery: the fe&s;tival literally went off with fly|ing colours. The orange ribbon was not only in every hat, cap, and bonnet of his Highne&s;s's human &s;ubjects, but extended to all the bea&s;tial train that have the honour to breathe in his and their High Mightine&s;&s;es Republic. The hor&s;es' heads, tails, manes, che&s;ts, and fet|locks, were decorated with it; nay, the figure of the Prince is crammed in little, into the buttons of the coats, and flags are hoi&s;ted on every &s;teeple: even the venerable figure of Era&s;mus, which &s;tands in the market-place, is mo&s;t ridicuiou&s;ly be-oranged. A filleting of that colour is wreathed round his hat, or rather cap, and fa&s;tened by an orange-&s;tring under his no&s;e, into the no&s;trils of which is &s;tuffed orange-peeling: the &s;a&s;h that ties the robe is fringed with it; the very &s;leeves of his gown are filled with real oranges, and his &s;hoe|&s;trings are drawn into orange-bows. Some|body, either out of zeal or waggery, has &s;topped up the &s;age's mouth with more of the
<PB N="522" REF="541">orange-peeling, and a capacious offering of that fruit covers the opened folio book which he holds in his hands: Whether it is that vo|lume of his works which contains the cele|brated treati&s;e on <HI>Folly,</HI> I am not able to inform you; but, whatever may be due to the honours of the day, it would be a pity &s;o noble a &s;tatue &s;hould be thus caricatured more than once in the year.</P>
<P>It is, however, a plea&s;ant &s;ight, to &s;urvey from the water in a tour round the canals, the barges of plea&s;ure, and tho&s;e of trade, all dre&s;|&s;ed in their be&s;t array: the arms and emblems of the Republic, and the colours of the Pro|vinces that con&s;titute it, brought under one point of view; many of the pendants reaching from the top gallant ma&s;t head to the river.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e appearances are real indica|tions of an happy or contented people, is not now the que&s;tion: Permit me yet a little while to amu&s;e you with more peaceable &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>To return to Dutch Guelderland.&mdash;No one but an humble Gleaner would &s;toop to pick up an ob&s;ervation on a <HI>warming-pan,</HI> and yet two different kinds of the&s;e in the two different
<PB N="523" REF="542">provinces of Utrecht and Guelderland, have entertained me more than any thing in which the affections are not engaged, &s;ince I left England.</P>
<P>In the former place as in the latter, the &s;e|vere weather which gloomed on my fir&s;t vi&s;it to the&s;e fine Provinces, made a warm bed among&s;t the nece&s;&s;aries of life: but a warming|bed-pan in the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion was not in general u&s;age, and the &s;ub&s;titute was whim&s;ical enough &mdash;an open earthen pan, full of living a&s;hes, was placed in an earthen platter, this again put into a large wicker cover, ba&s;ket form, not unlike a magpye's cage. This complicated machinery was placed in the bed, where it remained about twenty minutes, during which I was to freeze in expectation. A &s;imple warming-pan would have an&s;wered a better end in half a dozen turns; for the pertinacity of in&s;i&s;ting on its &s;taying its u&s;ual time, again&s;t all the arguments I could u&s;e with the chamberlain, was puni&s;hed by his &s;corching the &s;heets, which induced mine ho&s;te&s;s of Utrecht to give in to that mon&s;trous machine, as &s;he called it, an Engli&s;h warming-pan.</P>
<P>Farther up the country I was treated with a yet greater curio&s;ity; this was no other than a
<PB N="524" REF="543">Seltzer water-bottle filled with boiling mate|rials: What was to be done with this, do&s;t thou &s;uppo&s;e, my ingenious reader? Why it was to make the tour of the bed in a very regular progre&s;s, beginning at the head, and ending at the feet: an operation that took up at lea&s;t twenty minutes al&s;o, and with good attendance, for the bottle was to re&s;t little and be rolled much. The night following, in the hope of &s;hortening the labour, I ordered three warming|bottles, and the chambermaid being a good|natured girl, complied &s;milingly with my de|mand. One was placed at the head, a &s;econd in the middle, and a third at the feet. I was going to exult over the ignorance and barbarity in which the country had been &s;o long involved, when the middle warmer, which happened to be a common wine bottle, lo&s;t its cork, which dire event not being perceived till I had &s;ent away the maid, telling her I &s;hould be &s;ome time undre&s;&s;ing, and would carefully take out the bottles, when they had done their duty, my|&s;elf. By this manoeuvre the bed was inundated ju&s;t as I &s;tepped into it, with the additional <HI>agr&eacute;ment</HI> of my being in the dark; for that nothing might interrupt the repo&s;e I promi&s;ed my&s;elf, I had previou&s;ly put out my candle. This was a wor&s;e calamity, to me, at lea&s;t, than the &s;corched &s;heets; but putting both together,
<PB N="525" REF="544">you feel the difficulty which a traveller from the comfortable realm of Great Britain has to prevent being burned or drowned in his bed; &s;ince he is thus nightly in danger betwixt fire and water.</P>
<P>But the beds them&s;elves are objects of as humorous &s;peculation, as the machines by which they are warmed. There is a &s;cale of incon|venience and ab&s;urdity in them. In Holland they are indifferent, in Guelderland they are wor&s;e, in We&s;tphalia they are very hard upon you, and in Pru&s;&s;ia they are not to be endured, &s;carcely even by tho&s;e who
<Q><L>"Have made the flinty and rough couch of war</L>
<L>"Their thrice-driven bed of down."</L></Q> Aid me, ye powers, who pity aching bones, to de&s;cribe them! Be&s;ides the delightful cu&s;tom of frequently cramming a family, with the agreeable circum&s;tance of now and then intro|ducing a &s;tranger to keep you company in the &s;ame room, (this is really frequent in Ger|many, and you may think your&s;elf well off if they do not put a being you never &s;aw before into your bed), and that room &s;eldom a large one; it is no abu&s;e of a traveller's privileges to a&s;&s;ure you, that three of their beds put together do not more than make up what in England
<PB N="526" REF="545">would be con&s;idered as a decent bed for a man and his wife. Matter of fact will &s;anction me to de&s;ire you will read <HI>four</HI> in&s;tead of three, if you penetrate far into the Au&s;trian country. Nor is their breadth le&s;s &s;canty than their length. So far from being at your ea&s;e, &s;tretched out into your natural dimen&s;ions and proportions, that you mu&s;t contract your&s;elf into one half of your natural &s;ize, and &s;ometimes to curl your|&s;elf up like the curs of the country. In the Palatinate, I was once ab&s;olutely thru&s;t into &s;uch a crib that a well grown cat would have been only hand&s;omely accommodated: and for me, I was compelled to fold my&s;elf up like an eel; or if I were even to lie lengthways, from &s;ide to &s;ide, the matter would not have been much better, as even in that ca&s;e I mu&s;t have tucked my&s;elf into a double, as if tied neck and heels for execution: you flounce again&s;t the foot or &s;ideboards at every turn; and if, to be relieved from committing this outrage and a&s;&s;ault on your&s;elf, you take away either of the&s;e bar|barous pieces of wood, which &s;lide up and down, you incontinently fall out of bed: And that all the paraphernalia of the bed may be uniformly uncomfortable, the quilts, blankets, and &s;heets, are neither broad or long enough to keep you decently covered through the night, except you bundle and pack your&s;elf up in the
<PB N="527" REF="546">afore&s;aid manner, and are be&s;ides a very &s;ound and quiet &s;leeper indeed; the lea&s;t re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, though but in a dream, would de&s;troy the whole oeconomy of your bed, and on waking you would find your&s;elf in a &s;tate of nature, though in &s;leep you had &s;uppo&s;ed your&s;elf arrayed in a birthday &s;uit.</P>
<P>You have it, neverthele&s;s, in mind, that I &s;peak generally of Table D'Hotes, Taverns, and what in the&s;e countries are, with too much compliment, called good private lodgings. In private hou&s;es you occa&s;ionally find in the&s;e countries, as in others, good rooms, good fare, good beds, and good company. But tho&s;e are not properly &s;o much the objects of information to a traveller, who requires pa&s;&s;ing accommodations, at the public-inns, and private lodgings. The&s;e merit the cha|racter I have given them. Indeed, in all which are ju&s;tly called the <HI>comforts</HI> of life, Holland, Guelderland, Pru&s;&s;ia, Germany, and other countries, are &s;o many hundred years behind us, that we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to be at once proud and grateful: proud of our happy i&s;land, and grateful for the benign government, under which it flouri&s;hes. But more of this in its place.</P>
<P><PB N="528" REF="547">I &s;hould entertain you very much about the <HI>&s;torks</HI> to be &s;een in the United States of Hol|land, as <HI>that how</HI> they are lovers of Republics, and to be &s;een only in countries where freedom is enjoyed, and, <HI>as how,</HI> they are even there, only birds of pa&s;&s;age; vi&s;itors, not natives: and, <HI>as how,</HI> they hold con&s;ultations with one another throughout all the Republic, having as many deputies as the re&s;pective Provinces; and, <HI>as how,</HI> it is &s;ettled at a &s;olemn Synod, that the&s;e winged <HI>high</HI> mightine&s;&s;es, (for when erect they will mea&s;ure to the &s;tature almo&s;t of a man), are to quit Holland, on a certain day and hour, of a certain month, when the &s;torks of each Province, a&s;&s;i&s;t at the general a&s;&s;embly, held on &s;ome palace barn, or church &s;teeple, previous to their departure; <HI>and how,</HI> the invalids, and &s;uperannuated parts of the flocks of the&s;e liberty-birds, being unable to travel, and again&s;t the laws of the long-legged convention that they &s;hould be left behind, are very heroically, but unmercifully, put to death, by their fellow-creatures, and by them left unnaturally (&s;o cruel a thing is a too great love of freedom,) to moulder in a foreign land, while their murderers &s;et off, and go the Lord knows whither; and, <HI>as how,</HI> in the la&s;t place, the&s;e &s;agacious tribes, make their flight back, after a few months ab&s;ence, and e&s;tabli&s;h the
<PB N="529" REF="548">hour and moment of their return, by the &s;ame decrees and formalities, ju&s;t as if their town hou&s;es were in one Republic, and their country ones in another. Of all the&s;e things, I &s;ay, and a great many more, which many redoubted travellers have in&s;i&s;ted on, I &s;hould certainly give you my confirmation, but for one of the &s;imple&s;t rea&s;ons: &s;uch <HI>as how,</HI> there is as much truth as will lie in a nut&s;hell, and more fal&s;ehoods than could be crouded into a bu&s;hel, re&s;pecting the&s;e feathered gentry: The fact is, &s;ome go out of Holland, and &s;ome &s;tay in it all their lives. As a proof of the latter part of my po&s;ition, I refer you to the confe&s;&s;ion of half a dozen of the&s;e learned per&s;onages, who, (if they are as hone&s;t as good Republicans &s;hould be) will tell you have never left the Hague; nor, perhaps, that part of it y'clept the fi&s;h|market the&s;e many years: in that &s;pot I have &s;een them &s;wallow down their long ugly throats, as good a &s;mall fry as would have &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted a family: for the&s;e are among&s;t the &s;everal birds protected by &s;uper&s;tition in Holland. I have, likewi&s;e, &s;een the &s;aid Re|public-loving birds in Pru&s;&s;ia, and in other de&s;potic &s;tates, and even in &s;ome, where they are knocked on the head with as little cere|mony
<PB N="530" REF="549">as crows and &s;parrows. I had, more|over, an intimate acquaintance with a whole family of them, in one of the little German territories, governed by a petty Prince, who was as inveterate a tyrant, both to man, fi&s;h, and fowl, as was ever
<Q>"Dre&s;&s;ed in a petty, brief authority."</Q></P>
<P>Another cla&s;s of the privileged birds of Holland are the quails. The&s;e, more e&s;pecially in Guelderland, are pre&s;erved with even a reli|gious care: there is one or more, in almo&s;t every family, but by no means in Republican &s;itua|tions. They are caged, and hung at the &s;ides of the hou&s;es, where they tweedle their plain|tive notes, not as Thomp&s;on calls them to their <HI>"running</HI> mates," but to their &s;lavi&s;h fellow pri&s;oners, rather as if they mourned the lo&s;s of their freedom, than as if they &s;ung the Io Paeans of Liberty.</P>
<P>A yet more favoured tribe are the &s;wans, to kill or even maim which, is not only an offence of a private kind, but of public cognizance. A &s;wan fea&s;t, &s;uch as is partaken now and then in England, would by the magi&s;trates be deemed trea&s;on, and by the mob &s;acrilege; and here it is that this proud bird might,
<PB N="531" REF="550">indeed, &s;ing while dying, according to poetical fiction, to think that he had pa&s;t &s;o comfortable a life.</P>
<P>But of all the race that wing the air, a Nimeguen raven is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed. In that town, this croaking creature is of mighty importance to the inhabitants, who hold their very charter on a &s;ingular cu&s;tom concerning it. It is nece&s;&s;ary, for one or more of the&s;e ravenous birds to be maintained at pub|lick expence in great luxury. They are placed in a large wooden cage, which is but the outlet or balcony of a more &s;pa|cious inner apartment, &s;ituated on the quay, which faces that part of the Mai&s;e that looks to Arnheim. You never pa&s;s without &s;eeing &s;ome very nice fowls hung up for their repa&s;t, and picked for them as clean as if it had been for the table of the Burgoma&s;ter. I mu&s;t own, I have often wi&s;hed &s;ome of this good fare would have fallen down at the feet of many a poor, pulletle&s;s, wretch, whom I have &s;een ca&s;t up a longing look at the cage;&mdash;but all this luxury is to be eaten in an eternal pri&s;on, in the mid&s;t of a Republic that is boa&s;ting of its freedom. Did the charter-ravens know, however, what blood and mi&s;ery the &s;truggles for this freedom have co&s;t the people of Holland,

<PB N="532" REF="553">and what mi&s;ery and blood may yet flow to maintain it, they would have more occa|&s;ion to congratulate them&s;elves, perhaps, on being pri&s;oners for life, than to CROAK, like many of the Citizens of the Republic, after more liberty. Adieu.</P>

<P>WITH regard to the general hi&s;tory of this country, for many revolving ages, it re&s;embles the general hi&s;tory, alas, of almo&s;t every other nation in the habitable globe; a rubric picture of battles lo&s;t and gained, cities &s;acked or be&s;ieged, villages buried, burned, or de&s;olated, the fury of man contending with man, and the di&s;a&s;ters of human nature, aggra|vated by the ambition and weakne&s;s of human creatures.</P>
<P>From the very foundation of the Republic, to the year 1715, the &s;tory of Holland, and its beautiful dependencies, is nothing but a ti&s;&s;ue of difficulties and di&s;putes, foreign or dome&s;tic.
<PB N="533" REF="554">The inhabitants had &s;carcely time to breathe from one battle, and bind up its wounds, or bury its dead, ere another called them to the field. A war of years again&s;t Spain, for &s;ecur|ing the independence of the States, was &s;u&s;pended by a twelve years truce, it is true, but it was partial, and did not extend to their Indian po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The peace obtained in 1648, la&s;ted only four years, after terrible blood&s;hed. The fir&s;t war with Great Britain, continued to 1654. And ju&s;t as they began to reli&s;h the &s;weets of peace, they had to cope with three great powers at the &s;ame time, viz. Denmark, Portugal, and Sweden. Their ho&s;tilities in the North continued to 1660, and in the South to 1661. Then began their &s;econd conte&s;t with Great Britain, and did not end till their pacification treaty at Breda, in 1667, and the very next in&s;tant, they were invaded by Louis the XIVth. of France. A deceitful &s;ort of calm then took place for three years, when they were attacked unpreparedly, (indeed they appear never to have been prepared) by &s;ea and land, by the formidable and united forces of France and England. It was not till after a carnage of &s;ix years more, that the peace of Nimeguen, was concluded in 1678. Even that was not enjoyed without alloy; for Louis,
<PB N="534" REF="555">among&s;t other exactions, in&s;i&s;ted on their fur|ni&s;hing troops again&s;t Spain. This was the epoch, when the liberty, endangered by James the Second, invited the Prince of Orange, as an auxiliary for freedom. This memorable expedition was undertaken in 1688, and what|ever were its effects to Great Britain, involved the Dutch in a war, that la&s;ted within a year of that of the &s;iege of Troy. The peace of Ry&s;wick, was &s;carce concluded, when the di&s;putes about the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion opened another &s;cene of combat. This war even &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed in duration that of the Trojans, la&s;ting eleven years. The peace of Utrecht, indeed, gave the government time to lay down, or rather re&s;t on its arms. But as if this little Republic was fated to have no undi&s;turbed repo&s;e, fre|quent and bloody ruptures broke out betwixt the Dutch and the African Cor&s;airs, which made it nece&s;&s;ary for the former to keep a &s;trong armament in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>Thus, my friend, you &s;ee that in a cour&s;e of 147 years, which revolved from their fir&s;t taking up arms in 1566, to the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the inhabitants of this&mdash; what &s;hall I call it? little floating i&s;land&mdash;this molehill of land in a world of waters, did not enjoy, in pacific intervals, more than thirty
<PB N="535" REF="556">years And when all the&s;e public ho&s;tilities were at an end, and in re&s;pect of foreign tumults, the Republic was ble&s;&s;ed with a more &s;olid tranquillity, than it had ever known &s;ince its political exi&s;tence, their di&s;putes, quarrels, and Revolutions among&s;t <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> again involved them in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of troubles, triumphs, &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and mi&s;carriages, which filled up the re&s;t of their time, and which, con|tinue, in a great degree, to this very day.</P>
