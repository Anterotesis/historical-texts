<HEAD>TO JOHN FONBLANQUE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>COMMON place &s;atire, and panegyrick, &s;hould be enumerated among&s;t the VULGAR ERRORS, which, more or le&s;s, disfigure the good-&s;en&s;e and candour of every country. A number of the&s;e, more e&s;pecially of the former, attach to our own: and of all com|mon place cen&s;ure, that which is thrown, in the lump, upon profe&s;&s;ional men, is the mo&s;t illiberal and pernicious. The very names of Prie&s;t and Lawyer&mdash;the one ordained to in|culcate divine and eternal laws&mdash;the other ap|pointed to admini&s;ter a code of human ju&s;tice founded upon tho&s;e&mdash;can &s;carcely be men|tioned without affixing thereto unmanly epi|thets. The&s;e are extended even to modes of faith; concerning which men are divided in opinion: and as chri&s;tian dog, hypocritical catholick, heretick prote&s;tant, are retorted on the one hand; knavi&s;h Ifraelite, &s;en&s;ual
<PB N="vi" REF="4">mahomedan, are recriminated on the other. The generous will look on it all as the dark &s;hadow of prejudice; the illu&s;trious will di&s;|pel it as a vapour di&s;&s;olved by the &s;un. Yet popular ideas are a kind of moral epidemies; they may be cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the catching di&s;orders of our childhood. The cradle is &s;carcely exempt. The nur&s;ery breathes the contagion; mixing with all that we &s;ee, and hear, and ta&s;te. We imbibe fal&s;e opinions, even with our maternal nouri&s;hment: the tender parent, while &s;upporting the life &s;he gave, infu&s;es them with her ki&s;s. The in|fant li&s;ps in prejudice; and voice no &s;ooner forms it&s;elf into language, than it begins to expre&s;s that prejudice. In the parlour it gains &s;trength; and de&s;cending into the kitchen, grows into a &s;ize &s;o enormous, that neither the di&s;cipline of &s;chools, nor the pre|cepts of the written page, can wholly root it out. It is thus that the infant mind goes di&s;tem|pered into the world, and collecting force as it goes, from the power of habit and of example, the &s;preading malady has infected the world it&s;elf. Hence prejudices are to be
<PB N="vii" REF="5">ranked in the number of our FIRST IMPRES|SIONS; and like mo&s;t of tho&s;e, are indelible: for if intellect matured, and &s;entiment libe|ralized, efface &s;ome, others will remain. The parrot, the pie, and other imitative birds, may be ea&s;ily brought to run the routine of vulgar abu&s;e,&mdash;and, with as little difficulty they may learn a chime of virtuous epithets, but who &s;hall teach them to forget either the one or the other? The bad, and the good, mix in their &s;en&s;ele&s;s vocabulary, yet form idioms and language nearly as wi&s;e and generous, as tho&s;e which are adopted by the chattering echoes of &s;ociety, who call knave and fool on a like <HI>parroted</HI> principle.</P>
<P>In &s;incere hope, that &s;omething may be added to the arguments again&s;t the unfair practice of involving large bodies of re&s;pectable men in the crimes of individual members, the author has endeavoured to paint the virtues of men of different per&s;ua&s;ions and pur&s;uits, giv|ing to each the force of a living in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Of the three brothers, who&s;e characters are among&s;t the mo&s;t prominent objects of this
<PB N="viii" REF="6">work, one, has been di&s;criminated by integrity, firmne&s;s, and philo&s;ophick energy of mind; accompanied with tenderne&s;s of heart. An|other, by the aid of &s;terling talents and all|&s;ubduing per&s;everance, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for found principles, a &s;ound under&s;tanding, and as a &s;ound lawyer.</P>
<P>As a member of that dignified profe&s;&s;ion, which defines and maintains the rights of &s;ocial beings, and as a man&mdash;his private friends and the publick are fully competent to decide, how far the Gentleman, who&s;e name appears at the head of this volume, is properly cho&s;en to illu&s;trate the above-men|tioned traits in the characters of John and James Fitzorton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;tant he departed, Patty la|boured to convince Sir Gui&s;e, that her father had been blaming him&s;elf without cau&s;e, though the Baronet had mo&s;t likely &s;omething within, that overturned all her pious argu|ments on that &s;ubject; &s;he then told him, "that as their lodger would not be at home till late in the day, her mother thought it might be more agreeable to &s;it in the room above &s;tairs, which," &s;aid Patty, "is more plea|&s;ant, as it looks into the &s;treet, and if Sir Gui&s;e plea&s;ed, &s;he would &s;hew him the way," adding, "that even if their lodger &s;hould happen to arrive, he was &s;o good a gentle|man, &s;he was &s;ure he would not be di&s;|plea&s;ed."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e having few re&s;ources within him|&s;elf to which he could apply with any hope
<PB N="2" REF="12">of con&s;olation, accepted the propo&s;al, and followed his amiable guide into a &s;pacious dining apartment which opened into a drawing room, and that again into a more exten&s;ive bedroom, than the front of the hou&s;e &s;eemed to promi&s;e; "nor is this the be&s;t part either, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "for beyond this chamber there is another apartment as large again as this, but our gentleman&mdash;'tis all his own furniture you mu&s;t know&mdash;has filled it &s;o with goods of one &s;ort or another, that it is never u&s;ed, and I often &s;ay to my|&s;elf, what a pity it is &s;uch beautiful, grand things as are in that room, &s;hould be put out of &s;ight:&mdash;It is generally locked, but I &s;ee the key is now in the door."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, feeling his curio&s;ity excited by this eulogium, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to look at what had been &s;o favourably de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Patty ran ha&s;tily to open the door, and begged he would walk in. The Baronet entered; but in the next moment, abruptly receded with every mark of horror, as at the &s;ight of &s;ome dreadful apparition. Of dreadful apparitions, indeed, we have been
<PB N="3" REF="13">told with all the aweful pageantry of cir|cum&s;tances; and tho&s;e who have wi&s;hed to affect our imaginations or agitate our pa&s;&s;ions, by making us wi&s;h, yet dread to approach the phantoms they have conjured up, have at la&s;t wound up our hopes and fears to the expectation of &s;omething tremendous: but without u&s;ing any of the&s;e arts of heightening, never &s;urely, has the human eye been &s;truck with a &s;ight, nor the human &s;oul appalled with a &s;en&s;ation more terrible, than Sir Gui&s;e Stuart experienced on beholding the objects now di&s;played to his view.</P>
<P>In the apartment from which the Baro|net drew back, were placed tho&s;e very arti|cles, which, we have already ob&s;erved, were &s;aved from the general wreck of the abbey &s;ale: and Sir Gui&s;e &s;aw a &s;pacious room crouded with objects, which, though inani|mate, might rive the harde&s;t heart. Here was the bridal-bed, which admitted him as an unworthy partner, when the good and beautiful Matilda became his wedded vic|tim. Here al&s;o was depo&s;ited the family|piece that contained the portraits of her
<PB N="4" REF="14">parents, wreathing around her virgin form garlands of flowers; ah! little &s;u&s;pecting then, they were ever to be di&s;placed by thorny fetters; the &s;acred couch too, where|on, after the points of tho&s;e thorns fe&s;tered in her heart, &s;he breathed her la&s;t;&mdash;even the cradle which lulled awhile the cares that were in &s;tore for her unhappy children, the ill-treated Charles and Caroline. "How?&mdash; how came the&s;e here?" a&s;ked Sir Gui&s;e, in a voice that communicated the terrors it expre&s;&s;ed to the trembling Patty.</P>
<P>"I know not, an plea&s;e your honour," &s;he replied. "I was at &s;chool far away when they were brought, and I never a&s;ked or heard where they came from: but, as they belong to our lodger, my mother, I dare &s;ay, can tell."</P>
<P>"Who then is your lodger?"</P>
<P>"Sir John Fitzorton, plea&s;e your honour, is his honour's name."</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as it was po&s;&s;ible to augment the emotions of Sir Gui&s;e, they were in|crea&s;ed by this intelligence. "John Fitz|orton!" reiterated he in faultering accents,
<PB N="5" REF="15">"is he the owner of the&s;e goods, and the occupier of the&s;e apartments? and where is he? when does he come? perhaps he may be even now in his way hither:&mdash;hark! hark! child! there is a knock at the door; doubtle&s;s it is him&mdash;he mu&s;t not &s;ee me go out; open the window; O if it be him! where can I go? will he &s;tay long? is there any other way out of the hou&s;e? O hide, O hide me from the eye of John Fitz|orton!"</P>
<P>As he uttered the&s;e que&s;tions, he was run|ning wild as it were with dread about the rooms; and it was in vain that Patty a&s;&s;ured him, "it was only her father come back;" but this information, Sir Gui&s;e &s;eemed not even to hear. He continued to traver&s;e the apartments, and had got into the &s;tore-room with an idea of &s;eeking a hiding place; but there, yet more afflicting images &s;mote his view, and again drove him back in con&s;ter|nation, and he exclaimed, "Oh God! tho&s;e objects are more terrible, even than John Fitzorton! I had rather brave the &s;ight of
<PB N="6" REF="16">him, his whole family, and hell it&s;elf, than be clo&s;ed in that place!"</P>
<P>Without attending to the a&s;toni&s;hed Patty, who &s;uppo&s;ed that the madne&s;s he had ex|hibited the night before had returned, he precipitated him&s;elf down &s;tairs; ru&s;hed in a di&s;ordered manner by Robert and his wife, and &s;taring wildly at them without &s;peaking, got into the &s;treet.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;urpri&s;e which behaviour of this kind produces in the &s;pectators, takes off for a while all power of action; and Sir Gui&s;e had gained the pavement and was running along it at full &s;peed, like a man dreading pur&s;uit, before either the hu&s;band or wife could impart their &s;u&s;picions to each other. Both however agreed, when they recovered &s;peech, that his raving fits had returned; and when the daughter came, with an air &s;carcely le&s;s di&s;traught than his own, to give in her evidence, by relating his &s;trange de|meanour in the rooms above, they were
<PB N="7" REF="17">unanimous not only in their &s;entiments, but in their commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>"And no wonder," cried Robert Irwin: "what that poor man has upon his mind, is enough to drive the devil him&s;elf out of his wits, and if he had &s;een what I did ju&s;t now in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, he would have been madder &s;till. Behold ye, when I got there, his &s;ine lady-madam, had but ju&s;t got into bed, and &s;ome of the ringleaders of her gang were keeping it up over the dice-boxes, and the be&s;t wines out of poor Sir Gui&s;e's cellar; the porter, whom I waked out of his great chair, and, who is the only man I knew, told me that the &s;ervants, men and women, were a&s;leep, or dead drunk on chairs and &s;ophas and carpets in the dif|ferent rooms, lying among one another pig fa&s;hion.&mdash;O what a cur&s;ed thing it is to be a bad man, e&s;pecially a wicked father, my Patty!"</P>
<P>"Poor gentleman, how I pity him!" &s;aid Patty.</P>
<P>"But you have got &s;omething there, for his honour," ob&s;erved the wife.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="18">"You &s;hall hear," re&s;umed Irwin; "as nobody but the porter could &s;peak, he told me, he was &s;orry for his ma&s;ter's misfortunes, but it was more than that place was worth, to di&s;turb her lady&s;hip &s;o &s;oon after &s;he was gone to re&s;t: and to tell you the truth," whi&s;pered he, "a little bit of a rumpus hap|pened in cour&s;e of our grand doing la&s;t night, between our Squire Vally, as we call him, and a new Spark madam has ju&s;t taken a fancy to; and &s;o Vally, who is a de&s;peratious man, gave his rival, who is a bit of a lord too, they &s;ay, a box on the ear: whereupon, the Lord talked pretty much about &s;words and guns. Ma&s;ter Nicky Dabble, who is mo&s;tly here of late, &s;eemed to think that lawyering him a little would be be&s;t; but &s;ome how, they hu&s;sled Nick out of the hou&s;e, and as my lord,&mdash;what a plague is his name!&mdash;is a new vi&s;itor, and ju&s;t come to his e&s;tate,&mdash;you under&s;tand me, Robert: there was a confabulation betwixt Vall and our madam Tempe&s;t, as we call her; and the up&s;hot of it was, that &s;he wheedled, and he begged pardon; and I fancy, my Lord
<PB N="9" REF="19">and my Lady agreed to &s;ettle the difference above &s;tairs, and Vally and Nick are as merry as grigs below. There, you may hear them laughing away now."</P>
<P>"Well, I am glad they have made it up, however," ob&s;erved Patty, with the utmo&s;t innocence of thought, "only I wi&s;h her poor di&s;turbed hu&s;band had been there when the quarrel was made up; that he might have &s;hared it too."&mdash;"That might not have been quite &s;o well, mayhap," replied Robert, wink|ing at Margaret.&mdash;"But to fini&s;h my &s;tory; the porter advi&s;ed me to go as I came: for mo&s;t folks, Robert, &s;aid he, laughing, go away empty from this hou&s;e, even if they come into it loaded."&mdash;"No matter for that," &s;aid I; "then I'll &s;ee if I can't make a bit of a change in the old place: I &s;uppo&s;e the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e has got a corner of it above or below where he puts his things; now as he wants &s;ome of them, and has fallen into a bit of a &s;crape, I &s;hall thank you to &s;hew me where it is." "Why how you talk, Rob|ert!" &s;aid the porter, "this is not Sir Gui&s;e's hou&s;e, nor madam Tempe&s;t's neither, no,
<PB N="10" REF="20">nor Vally's, 'tis in &s;hort, nobody's hou&s;e, and every body's;&mdash;properly to &s;peak, it belongs," added he, laughing, "to one King Faro, harder than his name-&s;ake of old; for Tempe&s;t, and Vally, and Nick, and the Ot|leys, who are now at the top of the tree, and fifty others, are only his &s;ubjects, and he plays the deuce with 'em all &s;ometimes: and as to Sir Gui&s;e, he has been at peep-bo with his and my lady's creditors &s;ome time; and, except a &s;mall bundle which was brought here late la&s;t night, by one of Nick Dabble's chaps, &s;aying it belonged to Sir Gui&s;e, who had given his chum the &s;lip, I don't think he has a rag belonging to him in the hou&s;e: if you think that will be of any &s;ervice, you may take it, as nobody but I have &s;een it, for they were all drinking, dancing, diceing, and ma&s;querading when the chap brought it for Nick, and I think it is as well &s;aved out of old Nick's hands as not;" whereupon, the porter went to a clo&s;et in the great pa&s;&s;age, took out the bundle and gave it me; and here it is wife, and that's all I got for it: &s;o I came running off as fa&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="21">as my legs could carry me, ju&s;t as if I had e&s;caped from a den of thieves."</P>
<P>"I never heard &s;uch &s;hocking doings in my life," &s;ighed Patty; "but indeed, father, I cannot think but that Mr. Dabble, as you call him, tells things that are not true of his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s;&mdash;but all this time, poor Sir Gui&s;e is running di&s;tracted through the &s;treets." "That's true child," &s;aid Robert, "here, take this till I ju&s;t &s;tep into the par|lour; Margey, give me the key of the bu|reau, I mu&s;t take a little ca&s;h with me for fear of accidents."</P>

<P>WHEN Robert had ha&s;tily furni&s;hed him&s;elf, he &s;aluted his wife and daughter, bid them "get &s;omething good and comfort|ing for dinner," and taking the bundle, pro|mi&s;ed to return as &s;oon as he could.</P>
<P>Two hours did poor Robert Irwin, from the pure&s;t principles of compa&s;&s;ion, unin&s;pired by one grain of e&s;teem, &s;earch in vain for his object: at length, &s;lackening his pace, and
<PB N="12" REF="22">returning home with dejected looks and di&s;ap|pointed face, the &s;houts of a mob attracted his attention; and advancing to explore the cau&s;e, he perceived a man harranguing the croud with the utmo&s;t violence, while he held another man by the collar, and bawling forth, that "he would take his oath to the per&s;on being the one who had e&s;caped from his brother officer the day before, and that he was therefore his pri&s;oner, becau&s;e they were in partner&s;hip; and he would for that rea&s;on, as &s;oon part with his right hand as with the man;&mdash;for to tell you the truth, I &s;u&s;pect there has been a kind of collu&s;ion betwixt partner and pri&s;oner, aye, for aught I know, ma&s;ter Ju&s;tice too, and d&mdash;n me if I find them out, if I don't hang them all like &s;o many onions on a &s;tring: for if they cheat me, they have but another to cheat; I had a right to my thirds and never took a farthing."</P>
<P>The face of the pri&s;oner thus a&s;&s;ailed, was covered by his &s;pread hands, and the re&s;t of his body was &s;o encircled by the crowd, that very few of tho&s;e whom curio&s;ity had drawn, could di&s;cern their object. At length a
<PB N="13" REF="23">voice from the multitude, called aloud, "who owns this velvet cap?" which the per&s;on &s;peaking had placed at the end of a &s;tick elevated above the heads of the people; "I do," an&s;wered Robert Irwin, working his way through the crowd:&mdash;"I own it, at lea&s;t I know the head it was upon a little while ago: aye, and there is part of the head now in that fellow's hands."</P>
<P>Irwin elbowed on, and recognized Sir Gui&s;e Stuart. The mob, who had &s;ided with the latter from the time the a&s;&s;ailant had talked of collu&s;ion, his thirds, &amp;c. &amp;c. now began to take an active part in favour of the party a&s;&s;ailed, and &s;oon di&s;engaged the Baro|net's hair from the gripe of the enemy: while they were doing this, Robert held down the head of the a&s;&s;ailant by a manoeuvre of the &s;ame kind, rendering thereby the relea&s;e of Sir Gui&s;e le&s;s difficult, the a&s;&s;ailant having &s;oon enough to do to attend to his own head.</P>
<P>Meanwhile a gentleman riding through the &s;treet, where the mob had gathered together, &s;topped his hor&s;e, and de&s;ired to know the
<PB N="14" REF="24">nature of the affray? The per&s;on of whom he made the enquiry an&s;wered, "Why we hardly know what to make of it, Sir; but it &s;eems to be a fal&s;e arre&s;t, and upon the per&s;on of a poor man out of his &s;en&s;es." With great earne&s;tne&s;s and a voice of command, the gentleman &s;ignified that he was a magi&s;|trate, and ordered the croud to make way. The pri&s;oner fir&s;t caught his eye, and imme|diately muffled him&s;elf up in the flap of his coat, with a trembling caution that would have ju&s;tly marked him with &s;u&s;picion had the action been generally ob&s;erved. "By what authority fellow," que&s;tioned the gentleman, "do you hold that per&s;on in cu&s;tody?"&mdash; "By that of the law; I have a writ again&s;t him at the &s;uit of Mr. Nicholas Dabble, the attorney."&mdash;The gentleman &s;tarted, and &s;eemed ready to leap from his hor&s;e: "Let me look at the writ."&mdash;"Partner has it, but I knows my man, and I'll have him to lock|up-hou&s;e in Shire-lane, and then to Newgate, if he do not pay the money, and moreover clear up another little affair." At this in&s;tant Irwin &s;eemed de&s;irous to conceal him&s;elf al&s;o,
<PB N="15" REF="25">and going up as by &s;tealth to Sir Gui&s;e, he put the bundle into the Baronet's hand, &s;ay|ing, in a whi&s;per, "Take this, Sir, it will bring you off, but don't &s;ay any thing about Robert." After this, Irwin mixed in the thicke&s;t of the croud.</P>
<P>The gentleman now alighted from his hor&s;e, went clo&s;er to the parties; in his way to whom a general whi&s;per had circulated, touch|ing the name and authority of the magi&s;|trate. This whi&s;per &s;oon caught the bailiff. The late furious a&s;&s;ailant would have relin|qui&s;hed his prey, con&s;cious he could not legally hold it, and gone quietly off, but the gentleman, who had an eye upon all his movements, commanded him to tell his name and addre&s;s, together with that of his partner. &mdash;Now the commands of this gentleman, though depending very little on the &s;ofter arts of per&s;ua&s;ion, were the lea&s;t refu&s;able in the world. The trembling catch-pole obeyed, attaching to his obedience this curious de|fen&s;e, on which he relied for future favour, "I am &s;ure your honour, if my partner in this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould turn out a rogue, and if
<PB N="16" REF="26">Mr. Nicholas Dabble &s;hould prove he has outwitted him&s;elf, I mu&s;t be an hone&s;t man: I was looking for a coach while partner took hu&s;h-money of the pri&s;oner, and boa&s;ted of it to my face. Yes, and I went and left a bundle I had the care of at the pri&s;oner's hou&s;e, though I did not get a farthing of my dues out of the hu&s;h-money; for, thought I, if I can get the pri&s;oner to &s;wear bribery to partner, betwixt us both, partner may be hanged for taking money not to &s;ee, and cheating me into the bargain. Thus your wor&s;hip ob&s;erves plainly what &s;ort of an hone&s;t man I mu&s;t be."</P>
<P>"I do," an&s;wered the gentleman, "and you may go about your bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation the pri&s;oner ne&s;tled him&s;elf, as well and as long as he could, among&s;t the mob; but the gentleman, who had hitherto con&s;idered the aggre&s;&s;or in this affray as the principal object, had now lei&s;ure to advert to the aggrieved, in whom he &s;oon di&s;covered the per&s;on of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="27">Many, we tru&s;t, are the readers who, judging from them&s;elves, will be able to conjecture, what mu&s;t have been the feelings of an hone&s;t man, &s;uch as John Fitzorton&mdash; for he was the magi&s;trate, on this di&s;covery: Few, we hope, judging from them&s;elves, will know how to form any adequate idea of the &s;en&s;ations of the per&s;on di&s;covered.&mdash; They were, however, &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed in his behaviour. Concealment no longer po&s;&s;ible, humiliated by pre&s;ent, and degraded by pa&s;t circum&s;tances, all of which came with an overwhelming force upon his memory, he bowed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his protector as to the acknowledged virtue of a &s;uperior being. He bent his eyes to the ground, and, as if dreading to be &s;een by tho&s;e of John Fitzorton, he held the bundle which Robert had put into his hand, before his face, and then &s;lunk away.</P>
<P>John Fitzorton, after he had received his hor&s;e from the per&s;on, who had been walking him about, re-mounted and rode on.</P>
<P>Robert Irwin, believing he had e&s;caped un&s;een, ha&s;tened home almo&s;t immediately after
<PB N="18" REF="28">he had given the parcel to Sir Gui&s;e, and on reaching his hou&s;e, related the adventure in the &s;treet to his wife and daughter, ob&s;erving, that though his honour Sir John would not be di&s;plea&s;ed at him for going of a me&s;&s;age for an unfortunate man, yet to be &s;een with Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, after the &s;hocking thing that had happened at the ca&s;tle, might offend his honour. "Heaven forbid!" ejaculated his-wife. "Surely," ob&s;erved the daughter, innocently, "if people knew what the world &s;uffered from bad actions, they would try very hard to be good: but, thank God, father, people who have been bad may live to be good again."</P>
<P>"I hope I &s;hall be a proof of that Patty," &s;aid Irwin, with tears in his eyes: "all things they &s;ay are for the be&s;t, love; and, perhaps, Sir Gui&s;e having come to our hou&s;e in this manner, and &s;eeing the judgment that is upon him may make me better all the re&s;t of my life; I am &s;ure I will try, Patty: I will, indeed, love."</P>
<P>Here Robert mo&s;t affectionately renew|ed his endearments; and Patty returned
<PB N="19" REF="29">them. "Yes," &s;aid her mother, who&s;e apron had been to her eyes &s;ome time, "'tis a long lane that has no turning; you have but one fault in the world, Robert, and as to that, if you, when you are in your pa&s;|&s;ions, would &s;trike me, and not hurt my child, I &s;hould think nothing of it."</P>
<P>"I'll not &s;trike either, and do nothing but love and cheri&s;h you both for the time to come, as I do now in this manner"&mdash;"d&mdash;n me, if I do!" &s;aid Robert, with increa&s;ed emotion, "and poor dear Patty's hu&s;band &s;hall &s;leep in her arms to night."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as this peace-re&s;toring di&s;cour&s;e ended, John Fitzorton reached his lodgings, and without di&s;covering any thing particular in his air, or manner of &s;peaking, went up to his apartments. Our little family, therefore, were completely happy, in which &s;tate we will leave them to ta&s;te the joys of dome&s;tic reconciliation, the crowning of which was the enlargement of Patty's hu&s;band.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now follow the &s;teps of one who knew no &s;uch comforts, and who, alas! had no hope ever to enjoy them.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e Stuart was thrown into &s;uch additional di&s;order by the unexpected &s;ight of the man, who&s;e eye, even in the proude&s;t period of his life, he mo&s;t &s;ought to avoid, and who&s;e family he had &s;o irreparably in|jured, that, to meet him under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, and to receive that &s;ervice from his equity which could not have been expected from any other motive, &s;unk deeper into his mind, and &s;eemed harder to bear than any thing that had attended him &s;ince he became an outca&s;t. His re&s;cue from the gripe of the law, &s;o much wi&s;hed before, was now but a &s;econdary object of felicitation: it dwindled even to nothing in compari&s;on of the grand e&s;cape from John Fitzorton, who, indeed, was armed with terrors no villainy could brave or endure.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="31">After long wandering about without any &s;ettled direction, he found him&s;elf in Mon|mouth-&s;treet, and as he &s;urveyed the dif|ferent dre&s;&s;es there hung out at every door, a &s;udden thought induced him to accept the eager invitation of one of the traders to walk into a &s;hop. The trader &s;eeing a bun|dle under his arm which, more mechanically than from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, he had &s;till carried, &s;uppo&s;ed he was come rather to &s;ell than to buy, and de&s;ired to &s;ee his goods.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, thinking it might promote his plan, favoured the motion; and in&s;tead of bartering his watch for &s;omething he wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e, he untied the bundle, which he knew was the &s;ame that he had ha&s;tily packed at his lodgings in the Minories, and he &s;up|po&s;ed Robert Irwin had taken it from the bailiff; it contained a change of tho&s;e things of which Sir Gui&s;e &s;tood much in need: but on the parcel being opened, a &s;mall pacquet loo&s;ely wrapt emptied its contents on the floor.&mdash;"Good heavens!" exclaimed our Baronet, "how came this money here?" Now this exclamation, and the di&s;ordered
<PB N="22" REF="32">&s;urprize with which it was made, and the general air, as well as the particular look of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, and more than all his ap|pearing without any covering on his head, his velvet cap having been &s;omehow purloined after Robert owned it, did not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the trade&s;man in his favour. Indeed he ima|gined them to be neither more nor le&s;s than &s;tolen goods, which the thief wi&s;hed to turn into money, and that the money it&s;elf was among&s;t the plunder. A few que&s;tions, and particularly one, touching his bare head, and &s;lipper'd feet, produced confirmations of this &s;u&s;picion. Whereupon being a man of very nice honour, as to &s;tolen articles in ca&s;es where the odds were again&s;t his holding them with any &s;ecurity, he &s;aid, "he &s;aw plainly how that bundle had been obtained, and unle&s;s a better account was given than had yet been offered, he &s;hould feel him&s;elf called upon, as an hone&s;t man, to apprehend him as a rogue&mdash; for, pray, how came you to be &s;o much &s;urprized to find tho&s;e five guineas, if they were your property?"</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="33">"Becau&s;e," &s;aid the Baronet, very truly, "I knew no more of them than you did."</P>
<P>"That is rather &s;ingular too," ob&s;erved the clothier, "how they &s;hould get into an hone&s;t man's bundle without his knowledge. Secondly, be &s;o good to tell me where you came from? and, thirdly, who you are?"</P>
<P>To neither of the&s;e que&s;tions could Sir Gui&s;e give any &s;atisfactory reply. In truth, he did not even attempt it, and his &s;ilence was interpreted into a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of his villainy.&mdash;"Well, come," &s;aid the trader, "there is &s;ome &s;hame in you however, and as you may live to &s;ee your error I will let it pa&s;s. As to the linen in that parcel 'tis out of my line, nor &s;hould I choo&s;e to buy it if it were not. 'Tis a di&s;agreeable thing to put things forth, and have them owned, but if you wi&s;h to purcha&s;e any articles you &s;ee in the &s;hop or at the door"&mdash;here the trader ca&s;t a longing eye at the five guineas which Sir Gui&s;e had picked up&mdash;"why I will deal with you as if you were as hone&s;t a man as my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e wanted not &s;agacity to perceive that the laying out part, at lea&s;t, of the money
<PB N="24" REF="34">which had thus, unexpectedly, crept into his bundle, would be the only thing to &s;ave him, and he was glad the matter had taken that turn.&mdash;"I came into your &s;hop, Sir, not to fell but to purcha&s;e, and though you have wronged me by your &s;u&s;picions I will deal with you. I have a particular occa&s;ion for a drab coloured coat and wai&s;tcoat, I noticed hanging at your door, and the broad brimmed hat I perceived on a peg over it." "Here they are, but here is a &s;nug brown bob goes with them&mdash;better have that, and you'll be all of a piece," &s;aid the dealer, who did not doubt but our adventurer was going to take refuge from his pur&s;uers for the late or former of|fen&s;es, in the dre&s;s of a quaker. Sir Gui&s;e approved of the wig extremely, "and what think you of the&s;e brown wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and as to &s;hoes I can fit you in a trice&mdash;there, Sir, I'll be bound for their fitting as well as if they were made for you&mdash;but, perhaps, you had rather have boots," ob&s;erved the trader, who had now got into the &s;pirit of trade&mdash;"I can &s;uit you there too&mdash;I call my &s;hop every body's warehou&s;e&mdash;Lookee, Sir,
<PB N="25" REF="35">and here's a curious pair of &s;tocking breeches ju&s;t of the colour&mdash;and now you are &s;et up&mdash; unle&s;s you &s;hould like this hor&s;eman's coat, which, you perceive, is ju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tyle."</P>
<P>The Baronet agreed to the whole lot,&mdash; "well then," &s;aid the proprietor, "I'll be at a word&mdash;for I never make two prices&mdash; they are your's for the five guineas which &s;o much &s;urprized you ju&s;t now."</P>
<P>"You may put them up," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, "but I do not &s;ee how I &s;hall carry them&mdash; could I not get &s;omebody to take them as far as&mdash;" "O, yes, any where," in|terpo&s;ed the dealer&mdash;"there's a fellow going by the door who will I dare &s;ay be glad of the job&mdash;&s;hall I call him?" "If you plea&s;e," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e. The man expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to attend the gentleman; he &s;aid he was very poor, and had been looking in vain all the day for employment. The goods were &s;oon packed &s;o as to go into the bundle, except the brimmed beaver, which the dealer, facetiou&s;ly &s;aid, would be mo&s;t ea&s;ily carried on the new owner's head,
<PB N="26" REF="36">"where," added he &s;miling, and thinking he might take any freedom with a gentleman as hone&s;t as him&s;elf, "where I perceive there is a peg for it." The five miraculous guineas being paid into the long opened palm of the dealer the porter took up his load, and the purcha&s;er de&s;iring him to follow, the bu&s;ine&s;s ended not a little to the &s;atisfac|tion of all parties.</P>
<P>Thus Sir Gui&s;e, who within a few hours, had been taken for a madman and a thief, e&s;caped by good luck from being carried into cu&s;tody in either of tho&s;e characters: yet the la&s;t &s;ix and thirty hours had been the mo&s;t di&s;|a&s;trous of his life. They were the fir&s;t he had ever pa&s;t in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, where he was taught the rudiments of what, to &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, is only to be learned in that academy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE intere&s;ting objects which our ad|venturer &s;aw at the ho&s;pitable Robert Irwin's, and the different impediments he had met
<PB N="27" REF="37">with in his way, had con&s;umed &s;o much time that the &s;econd day of his wanderings was far &s;pent before he found him&s;elf extricated from the &s;everal ills which had annoyed and threatened him.</P>
<P>At length the world was once more free before him: yet he was no le&s;s perplexed, and uncertain what road to take, or what plan to pur&s;ue, than at the fir&s;t moment of his emigration. In truth, his embarra&s;&s;ment had con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. In each of the di&s;a&s;ters that had overtaken him, he col|lected &s;omething of the general and hone&s;t &s;en&s;e of mankind re&s;pecting his character. This might be gathered from the di&s;cour&s;e of the rabble at lady Tempe&s;t's fa&s;hionable rout, and even from the reflections of the &s;ons and daughters of riot in a common night-hou&s;e. Even the bounty of his old &s;ervants, the Irwins, was but the alms of charitable natures who&s;e pity was excited, on general principles, while the impre&s;&s;ion of their abhorrence of him, as an individual, re|mained in full force. In the neglect and malignity that he experienced from the friends
<PB N="28" REF="38">and partners of his mi&s;deeds, he felt that vice cannot be faithful even to its cho&s;en a&s;&s;ociates; and in the accidental good office which had been afforded him by the &s;uperb John Fitz|orton, he could not but perceive that the &s;ervice rendered by the magi&s;trate was di&s;|tinct from the &s;entiment entertained by the man, and that while the ju&s;tice of the one be|&s;towed official relief, the other exhibited, even in his &s;ilence, the profound of contempt.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, under this accumulated con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own unworthine&s;s, thus &s;ucce&s;&s;ively forced upon him, that he went into the &s;econd-hand cloaths &s;hop, the direct|ing idea being &s;imply to purcha&s;e &s;ome dre&s;s that might &s;erve as a &s;creen to veil him from general obloquy. Shame, fear, and, we will hope, &s;omething like regenration of virtuous emotion, even though that emotion had been in a manner wrung from him, went to the formation of this idea.</P>
<P>Behold then our Baronet followed by his temporary &s;quire, &s;allying forth with as little arrangement what point of the compa&s;s to &s;teer by, as the &s;quire or knight of Cervantes.
<PB N="29" REF="39">In woefulne&s;s of countenance, indeed, there was &s;ome real re&s;emblance betwixt the im|mortal Quixote, and our forlorn Baronet, but, alas! none either in their di&s;po&s;itions, or motives of enterprize. Sir Gui&s;e Stuart had neither the knight of la Mancha's extrava|gance of honour, nor his wi&s;h of acquiring fame by heroic deeds: by the re&s;cue of in|nocence oppre&s;&s;ed, or the voluntary encounter of dangers and of death. Indeed, our Baronet's &s;ole de&s;ign, in the purcha&s;ing his coat of mail, was to e&s;cape the wounding eyes of tho&s;e whom he him&s;elf had outraged: and had the hone&s;t, the mi&s;guided, hero of the Spani&s;h &s;tory, met him in his career, and been previou&s;ly made acquainted with his cour&s;e of life, he would have been thought a giant of guilt and necromancy, more de|&s;erving of the avenging lance than any mon&s;ter he had contended with in the pro|gre&s;s of his adventures.</P>
<P>His attendant &s;quire, indeed, had no trace of the merry-hearted Sancho; but followed the &s;teps of his employer with gloomy fide|lity, from one place to another, till the
<PB N="30" REF="40">&s;hades of evening, and &s;ome more powerful circum&s;tances induced him to a&s;k our hero whither he was going? This que&s;tion re|ceived no an&s;wer, becau&s;e it was found un|an&s;werable: Sir Gui&s;e had been long rumi|nating what he &s;hould do with him&s;elf. The adherent ventured, at length, what follows: "Po&s;&s;ibly, Sir, you have lo&s;t your way, or may be you overheard what the man &s;aid to me in the &s;hop about you, and &s;o don't like to go into your old haunt, wherever it may be, le&s;t I &s;hould run back and tell him. Now if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e I will tell you a &s;ecret. I am a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed bit of a gentle|man my&s;elf, and when an odd thing lies in my way, &s;uch as a &s;tray bundle, a few loo&s;e guineas, or what not, why I have no objec|tion to it, and for all I am in &s;uch a pickle now, am as keen a fellow as you can be. In a word, I am one of the &s;ort&mdash;and, therefore, you have nothing to fear from me: For all that perhaps you don't like we &s;hould join forces&mdash;&s;ome, in our line, like doing bu&s;ine&s;s alone; others are for partner&s;hip.&mdash;If you prefer the latter we mu&s;t take a loving pot,
<PB N="31" REF="41">or bottle together, and &s;ay good luck to one another. We are near to the &s;ign of the Hand-in-hand, where &s;ome of the &s;ort meet; it lies ju&s;t cleverly for the great we&s;t road, has good &s;tabling, a knowing o&s;tler, and a|man may be in town or country, hor&s;eback or on foot, in five minutes."</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e might have terrified a &s;touter heart than that of Sir Gui&s;e, not, perhaps, on account of the thing it&s;elf, for he had long a&s;&s;ociated with probably more guilty pe&s;ts of &s;ociety than the poor rogue then at his elbow. Indeed had our Baronet been made of more courageous materials it is not impo&s;&s;ible but that the &s;light hold which con&s;cience yet had of him, and an al|mo&s;t de&s;pairing &s;ituation, might have then united him with the &s;ociety to which his a&s;&s;ociate alluded: but a certain dread that &s;eized his joints, and the fa&s;ting and fatigue, which weighed upon his limbs, extorted from him, in a &s;ort of half uttered, and half re|pre&s;&s;ed way, this heart-riving apo&s;trophe, "O! Sir Gui&s;e, Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, that you &s;hould be brought to all this!"</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="42">To u&s;e the be&s;t and mo&s;t appo&s;ite language of the inmo&s;t de&s;criptions of the pa&s;&s;ions and emotions of nature, "as if that name &s;hot from the deadly level of a gun had mur|dered him,"&mdash;"Great God!" apo&s;trophi&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hed companion! "and is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould again be in the &s;ame place with Sir Gui&s;e Stuart? I thought, indeed, I knew &s;omething of his face, disfigured as it is by time, and by that long beard."&mdash;Indeed the latter was then of three days' growth, being routed by the baili&s;&s;s before the dre&s;&s;ing hour, and having had &s;carce a moment &s;ince, that could be devoted to adornment.&mdash;"Ah! Sir Gui&s;e," continued the follower, "if you are really he who had the great hall, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, where I knew you, and are owner of the abbey in the we&s;t of England, you are the bittere&s;t enemy I ever had in the world, and have brought me to this pa&s;s&mdash; but, as it appears you have brought your&s;elf to nearly as bad, I won't&mdash;no&mdash;d&mdash;n me, I won't &s;ay any more&mdash;we mu&s;t now both of us live as we can."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="43">"And who are you?" faultered out Sir Gui&s;e, &s;carcely articulating.</P>
<P>"See," replied the other, "how things come about&mdash;Don't you remember Giles Smith, though that's not the name I go by now&mdash;Don't you remember the combu&s;tible bu&s;ine&s;s that brought to the ground old ma&s;ter Atwood's hou&s;e? and don't you re|member &s;muggling off his daughter Jenny? a d&mdash;mn'd affair that&mdash;my fir&s;t devil's work as I may &s;ay for you&mdash;and though you gave me all the work of the hall&mdash;I was a ma&s;on too you know in the next pari&s;h&mdash;I never throve &s;ince, but took to thieving, and if I &s;how my face again at the Old-Bailey 'twill go hard with me. I did but ju&s;t nick it la&s;t time. Take care how you get there, Sir Gui&s;e, if you have been at the bar before. They mark their men out of a &s;et, as &s;port&s;|men do a bird out of a whole covey. They had winged me before&mdash;but mum&mdash;I won't do you any harm&mdash;Walls have ears, and this is a notorious part of the town we have got into.&mdash;But what am I to call you? you don't go by your own name of cour&s;e.&mdash;The
<PB N="34" REF="44">&s;hopman whi&s;pered he would make it worth my while if I would call, and let him know where you took me to, but I'd be d&mdash;d fir&s;t&mdash;though you have been my ruin&mdash;for as I &s;ee you are one of us&mdash;and upon the &s;hift&mdash; I'll not be the man to bring you up before your time. If we can't be true to one another 'tis very hard.

But you &s;ee the condition I am in, and if you can help me to a trifle for back and belly I hope you will; for, to tell you the truth, I am as poor as a rat, and as tired as a dog, and what is wor&s;e have not broke my fa&s;t to day."</P>
<P>"Nor have I &s;carcely," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, "and if you have any place where we can &s;top, without any danger of being di&s;turbed, I will," added he with a heavy &s;igh, "do what little I can for you."</P>
<P>"As to that," ob&s;erved Smith, "we can't be better than at the Hand-in-hand at
<PB N="35" REF="45">pre&s;ent. 'Tis ju&s;t between the hours: tho&s;e who are for the country are off; and the town chaps won't meet till midnight, after all the public places are &s;hut.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>EXHAUSTED by what he had already undergone in body and mind, Sir Gui&s;e felt for a moment, an indifference to what be|came of him, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led into the hou&s;e. The ragged condition of the one, and the &s;habby gentility of the other, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the broad brimmed hat, a&s;&s;orted well enough with the different appearances a&s;&s;umed by the nimble-fingered race, and on calling for a bottle of port with bi&s;cuits and ru&s;ks, they were &s;hown into a private room. When the wine was brought, its price was to be paid on the &s;pot; "a rule, which may perhaps, &s;urprize you," &s;aid Smith to Sir
<PB N="36" REF="46">Gui&s;e, when the waiter was gone; "but if you con&s;ider the precarious &s;ituation of the cu&s;tomers who frequent this hou&s;e, many of whom are taken away to pri&s;on without a moment's warning"&mdash;</P>
<P>"To pri&s;on!" repeated Sir Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>"You will not wonder," continued Smith, "that every thing here is for ready money only." "Are there no per&s;ons that frequent it but of the de&s;cription you allude to?" a&s;ked the alarmed Sir Gui&s;e. "O yes," an|&s;wered Smith, "but it is a rule of the hou&s;e, to &s;et down every man as a rogue whether he be &s;uch or not; but don't alarm your&s;elf, for at any rate we are &s;afe; I am an old cu&s;tomer, and was once a leading member of a club held in the room above, and you will of cour&s;e, be taken for my friend." "I &s;ee," cried Sir Gui&s;e, "that circum&s;tances have rendered me obnoxious to mi&s;takes, where|ever I go, I a&s;&s;ure you, Smith." "P&s;haw, don't vex your&s;elf about that," interrupted Smith, who was &s;ettled in his faith about Sir Gui&s;e, and had begun on the wine and bi&s;|cuits,
<PB N="37" REF="47">with great diligence; "we are liable to mi&s;takes: come, come, do as I do."</P>
<P>While the Baronet &s;teeped his ru&s;k in &s;ome wine, Smith adverted again to the contents of the bundle, and a&s;ked, "for what purpo&s;e he had made a purcha&s;e of the quaker-&s;uit of cloaths, and the drab riding-coat? Come, Sir Gui&s;e, open your heart at once," added he; "you were always a cautious man: a &s;hy cock, as we &s;ay, you know&mdash;whatever prank you have played, that dre&s;s will bring you through, ha! ha! ha!&mdash;a good thought &mdash;who will &s;u&s;pect a prim quaker to be a bundle-&s;tealer?"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e not reli&s;hing this &s;u&s;picion, told Smith the adventures of the la&s;t eight and forty hours.</P>
<P>"Curious," &s;aid his comrade, "a very curious &s;tory: yes, I always thought what would come of your marrying that terma|gant." Another &s;upply of wine and bi&s;cuit was ordered. "Apropos, what &s;ay you to a &s;lice of butter? ru&s;ks and bui&s;cuits are dry eating by them&s;elves," &s;aid he. "I &s;ee clearly now what you are upon: you think
<PB N="38" REF="48">you may have better luck in a new dre&s;s; your old one, I gue&s;s, is too well known; to tell you the truth, I &s;hould like to adopt your plan: &s;uppo&s;e therefore," &s;aid he, as &s;oon as the waiter again di&s;appeared, "I ca&s;t this old &s;kin of mine and put on yours, while you make your&s;elf into a Simon Pure.&mdash; Ob&s;erve, I can draw the bolt of the door and it is done in a twinkling."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, who anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed an oppor|tunity to put on his di&s;gui&s;e, agreed to the propo&s;al. "Strip then is the word," &s;aid Smith, fa&s;tening the door and dropping his tatters with a di&s;patch, yet with a compo&s;ure that &s;hewed he was familiar with expedients. But Sir Gui&s;e, though no le&s;s di&s;&s;olute, had moved in the higher paths of di&s;honour; had been accu&s;tomed to more &s;plendid vici&s;&s;i|tudes, and could not ea&s;ily dive&s;t him&s;elf of the external manners of a gentleman. He was therefore, more impeded in his progre&s;s, and not a little embarra&s;&s;ed at making an entire change of apparel before the man, whom in the proud day of authority, he had made a &s;ubordinate in&s;trument in the mo&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="49">atrocious actions. An ob&s;ervation, however, from Smith, on hearing a noi&s;y party coming into the next room, and calling riotou&s;ly for half a dozen bottles from the "good-luck|bin," &s;oon quenched the few blu&s;hes of inge|nuous &s;hame that &s;tood in the way of our Baronet's di&s;patches, and he was equipped in a few minutes at all points fit for the taber|nacle. "I take it," whi&s;pered Smith, "there is one of the early gangs come in, and by their &s;pirits I judge, have been pretty &s;ucce&s;s|ful. &mdash;'Ecod I like my&s;elf &s;o well in this green coat and &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat, that I am half tempted to make a little tour of my own acro&s;s the country. I do think I &s;hould have &s;ome luck in your coat, my old friend, e&s;|pecially, if I &s;tood in your &s;hoes, or &s;lippers, which is the &s;ame thing, and red-morocco will not at all &s;uit your dre&s;s: the&s;e &s;hoes of mine will &s;et you on your legs famou&s;ly; well, what &s;ay you, &s;hall we try our fortunes? Who knows?&mdash;There is no moon.&mdash;Nice and dark: we are ju&s;t off the &s;tones; the lamps are never half lighted at the &s;kirts of the town:&mdash;at any rate, we had better be off
<PB N="40" REF="50">now, unle&s;s you are determined on the third bottle."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e declared, "that he had not any more money, and did not think, till he had rummaged his pockets, he could have found enough to pay for the two former." "No," &s;aid Smith, incredulou&s;ly: "what the deuce &s;hall we do about the waiter?&mdash;O! I have it;&mdash;&s;top, let me do up your parcel:&mdash;there, it will be much lighter for you now.&mdash;Do you &s;tay here, and I will go and &s;peak to Scuttle the waiter, who is a good natured fellow, and when I have &s;ettled it with him, I will come and fetch you: for between our&s;elves, &s;ome of the hue-and-cry gentry will be taking their rounds pre&s;ently."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e felt unea&s;y at the thoughts of being left alone, and as rogues are exactly as &s;u&s;picious as hone&s;t men are confident, he a&s;ked tremulou&s;ly, "why they &s;hould not go and &s;peak to Scuttle together. I will give him one of the handkerchiefs, or cravats out of the bundle: will not that do? &s;aid the Baronet." "No, I will tell you how it &s;hall
<PB N="41" REF="51">be; I &s;hould not have thought of giving that fellow a thing of that value."</P>
<P>Smith opened the door, looked into the pa&s;&s;age, where not &s;eeing any body, he took the hand of Sir Gui&s;e, who had, indeed, taken Smith by the &s;kirts of the coat, and moving quietly, they gained the &s;treet with|out any interruption. "And now," &s;aid Smith, "we mu&s;t determine on &s;omething; do we part, or do we keep together?&mdash;See, people are pouring apace into the Hand-in|hand. Suppo&s;e we cro&s;s over the way, and then we can think. Plaguy dark. Mind how you go; and for fear we &s;hould mi&s;s one another, when you get on the pavement, cry hem."</P>
<P>Being arrived on the other &s;ide, Sir Gui&s;e gave the &s;ignal; pau&s;ed a few minutes, then repeated it to as little purpo&s;e: and after a longer interval hemmed once more. His companion, who had in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, been kind enough to carry the bundle for Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, now carried it for him&s;elf. In a word, Smith in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing over, figured into the very hou&s;e which he affected
<PB N="42" REF="52">to quit by &s;tealth, and left his a&s;&s;ociate from whom he had nothing more to expect, to go where he thought proper: perfectly &s;atisfied he would never either think or dare to look for him, the &s;aid Smith, in the Hand-in-hand hotel.</P>
<P>Thus was Sir Gui&s;e, after having made another di&s;covery of the extent of his wide &s;preading &s;eductions, again driven unpro|tected into the &s;treet. What is far wor&s;e, that con&s;cience, which, had it been clear, might have darted a chearful ray of light from within, told him, his lot though hard, was merited. Incapable of choice, he took the path in the direction it lay, from where he had cro&s;&s;ed; an afflicting &s;ight broke from his heart, and he continued his route in one un|deviating line for many hours, during which, he was &s;o abforbed in an aby&s;s of reflection on the events of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent time, that his fearful nature had no lei&s;ure to yield to any apprehen&s;ions from &s;olitude and dark|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The fate of Sir Armine, the exile of Charles, Caroline, Denni&s;on and the Monk,
<PB N="43" REF="53">the flaming cottage of the Attwoods, the plots upon Jane, the treachery of Miles, Dabble, and their banditti, the tyranny of lady Tempe&s;t, and the &s;corn of John Fitz|orton; all haunted his midnight path, and impelled him forward, almo&s;t without know|ing that his feet were in motion.</P>
<P>At day break, he perceived him&s;elf on a road he had often traver&s;ed, under all the &s;miling au&s;pices of fortune and of power; by mere accident he had &s;truck into the broad high way that led to the county in which &s;tood the abbey.</P>
<P>Yet, to what end &s;hould he go farther in that road? to what purpo&s;e &s;hould he take any other? was there in any part of the town or country a being of either &s;ex, who&s;e eye would gladden, or who&s;e heart would bound to greet him? to whom, either his pro&s;perity would be welcome, or his misfor|tunes endearing? Should he pur&s;ue his pre&s;ent track, even to the abbey, that venerable man&s;ion, he thought, was now a mi&s;erable ruin like him&s;elf, and even that ruin not at his command. Although Henry and Olivia
<PB N="44" REF="54">might be at the ca&s;tle, would they afford him &s;uccour? it was madne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e it. Should they be ab&s;ent, was not an indelible mark &s;et upon him by every member of their hou&s;e|hold? Could he return to the ho&s;pitable hou&s;e of the Irwins? there, the terrifying furniture of his di&s;mantled abbey ro&s;e to his view, and there, yet more tremendous, was John Fitzorton!</P>
<P>Such were the que&s;tions he put to him&s;elf, and &s;uch their replies: while both &s;erved but to point the forlorn &s;tate of his character, and condition. "Whither then &s;hall I go, and what will become of me?" &s;aid he, &s;miting his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>But, all this time, he went rapidly on, and having neither the wi&s;h nor the means to &s;top, he out-travelled in the cour&s;e of the day all that had partially got the &s;tart of him for a while.</P>
<P>Towards evening the we&s;tern coaches pa&s;|&s;ed him, and &s;topped to change hor&s;es, at about an hundred yards after they left him behind. As &s;oon as he came up with them, one of the coachmen as he was going by,
<PB N="45" REF="55">exclaimed, "Egad ma&s;ter, you have got a brave driving coat there which you don't &s;eem to know what to do with." "Have you any inclination for it?" an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, who had found it unwieldy to bear on his back, and intolerable to carry under his arm. "You'll a&s;k too much for my pocket, I fear, but I will tell you what I will do with you, I know you quakers don't u&s;e many words. I will give you his maje&s;lty's picture in gold, and a ride any where on this &s;ide Plymouth, if you are going that way: I have but one pa&s;&s;enger, who I believe is in his fir&s;t &s;leep; what &s;ay you, friend?"</P>
<P>Our adventurous Baronet approved the fir&s;t part of the propo&s;al very well; for though the great coat might at &s;ome future period be u&s;eful, the offered guinea would be &s;o immediately; he did not &s;ee the advantage of the offered ride, and yet it being nece&s;&s;ary to go &s;omewhere, he thought he &s;hould, during that ride, have a better opportu|nity to think, and come to &s;ome conclu&s;ion, e&s;pecially as it was likely to be a &s;tormy night, in a coach than on foot. "Well,
<PB N="46" REF="56">friend," &s;aid the coachman facetiou&s;ly, as he was coming out of the hou&s;e, where he had been taking his dram; "&s;hall thee and I &s;hake hands upon it, a &s;pike and &s;pan new guinea, look'e, and as ea&s;y a coach as ever man &s;lept in: if you have a mind for a nap, you will think your&s;elf &s;winging in a commo|dore's cot." "There is no bed to be had here, &s;ir," &s;aid the landlord of the inn, "we have been obliged to turn &s;ome of our cu&s;to|mers away, and &s;o I think you can't do bet|ter than accept the coachman's offer." "It &s;hall be &s;o then," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, delivering the coat. The driver opened the door, and helped our quaker-&s;eeming hero into the coach, where he was &s;carcely &s;eated, though it was too dark to make any u&s;e of his eyes, when a mo&s;t violent &s;noring a&s;&s;ailed his ears. "Perhaps," &s;aid the landlord, "the gentle|man would like to take &s;omething." "Plea&s;e to bring me a roll, or a cru&s;t of bread, and a gla&s;s of brandy," &s;aid the Baronet; but while they were gone to fetch them, he regretted his having given the order, reflect|ing he had no money to pay for it, and he
<PB N="47" REF="57">could not pre&s;s for the guinea &s;o abruptly; when it was brought, he a&s;ked with &s;ome he&s;itation, "whether the landlord could give him change." "No, d&mdash;n it, don't change for a cru&s;t and a gla&s;s of brandy and water," &s;aid the coachman, "I hate dry bargains: I always think they never thrive with a body;&mdash;&s;et it up to me, landlord." Sir Gui&s;e a&s;ked if he would partake of it. "Enough is as good as a fea&s;t, friend: warm your own in&s;ide with it, and let me warm my out&s;ide by han&s;elling the coat, for it begins to mizzle." While the coach|man folded him&s;elf up in his new purcha&s;e, Sir Gui&s;e fini&s;hed his repa&s;t, which was in truth much wanted; and after the u&s;ual adieus, the vehicle continued its journey.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the fir&s;t three or four miles Sir Gui&s;e thought intently, but the very inten&s;ity of that thought, his former violent exerci&s;e, both of body and mind, and the lulling motion of the coach, di&s;po&s;ed him, at length,
<PB N="48" REF="58">to imitate his unknown fellow-traveller by falling a&s;leep.</P>
<P>How long he remained in this comfortable oblivion of him&s;elf, and of his misfortunes, cannot be known; but, ere it was yet day, a &s;udden jerk of the vehicle &s;hattered one of the &s;ide gla&s;&s;es from the frame, and both our &s;lumberers awoke at the &s;ame in&s;tant. This brought on a &s;hort conver&s;ation between the pa&s;&s;engers, one of whom &s;aid he was happy on waking out of a nap to find he had got a companion; "not," added he, "that I am properly an in&s;ide pa&s;&s;enger, only as there was not any one in the &s;tage, and as I am an ac|quaintance of the coachman's, and 'twas likely to be an ugly night, he gave me a lift; but if you have any objection, Sir, as I am but a &s;ervant, and in a manner, out of my place&mdash;if you'll pardon the joke, I'll turn out, and get upon the box."&mdash;Sir Gui&s;e, whom recent events had taught &s;omething of humility, told his fellow-traveller there was no occa&s;ion; whereupon the former &s;peaker continued: "Going into Devon, I hope, Sir? as I &s;hall then have more of your good com|pany.
<PB N="49" REF="59">I &s;top a few miles on this &s;ide Dart|mouth. If you are of tho&s;e parts I dare &s;ay you may know either me or &s;ome of my ma&s;ters, God ble&s;s their honours, and all the family!&mdash;&s;uch a family as would do your heart and &s;oul good to know them: the Fitzortons, Sir, I mean; a brave old hou&s;e their ca&s;tle; we &s;hall &s;ee it a few miles on this &s;ide Dartmouth: a noble park too, and as fine gardens as you &s;hall wi&s;h to look at; but what are they? nothing!&mdash;not worth thinking about in compari&s;on of the family they belong to. A hou&s;e, park, and a garden, are fine things, and God gave them, and God be prai&s;ed for it; but where they are placed or built there they &s;tand like &s;tocks; but good people, who can move about to find people, who have only a cottage and bit of garden at the end of it, are better to my thoughts than all the gardens and ca&s;tles in the world."</P>
<P>A profound and audible &s;igh now caught the ear of the per&s;on who had been &s;peak|ing, and a pau&s;e en&s;ued on both &s;ides, in the cour&s;e of which, the &s;igh was repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="60">"I don't know why, but it is a &s;hocking thing to hear any body &s;igh," ob&s;erved the other pa&s;&s;enger: "it always makes me &s;igh too. May be your honour may be unea&s;y at &s;omething that is on your mind, and do not like to hear talking. Some do and &s;ome don't. Our Mr. Sir John can't bear to hear a word &s;poken by man, woman, or child, when he is vexed or unea&s;y, but mu&s;t have it all to him&s;elf, though it la&s;ts for a week. If you do but &s;ay a word, he will frown and growl at you, and go and lock him&s;elf up; but Squire Henry, God love his dear tender heart! the more kind things you &s;ay to him the more he loves you, and though he may &s;ometimes be too heart-full to make you any an&s;wer, when he comes to him&s;elf he will &s;peak to you &s;o kindly, and thank you for your love and trouble, that it would make you cry like a child, I am &s;ure it has me a thou&s;and times, to hear him. Now as I don't know which of the&s;e ways is your way, &s;ir, if I offend, or make you wor&s;e by talking, only &s;ay &s;o, and I will not &s;peak another word all the way."</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="61">The generous &s;peaker having waited &s;ome time without receiving any check, imagined conver&s;ation might amu&s;e and relieve his fel|low traveller, on which idea he proceeded; "Ah! good &s;ir, we have all our &s;orrows, and the be&s;t often the mo&s;t, as I dare &s;ay you know by your&s;elf. Why even mo&s;t of our family at the ca&s;tle have had terrible tryals. To begin with Sir Armine, all the world has heard of his goodne&s;s, for all that, he had his enemies, and one who I fear &s;hort|ened his life."</P>
<P>"I fear &s;o too," faultered a voice that &s;tartled the ear of the ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>"You have heard of the &s;tory then, and no doubt," re&s;umed the other &s;peaker, "know many more &s;ad &s;tories that go along with that affair. If &s;o, you can be no &s;tran|ger to the &s;hocking doings among&s;t &s;ome neighbours of ours.&mdash;Thank God Almighty, the &s;torm is pretty well blown over now: but there will be a long account for &s;omebody to &s;ettle by and by. Doubtle&s;s then you know the abbey-family?"</P>
<P>"I do," an&s;wered the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="62">"Aye, I don't wonder at your &s;ighing," ob&s;erved the other, "they have made my heart ach many and many a time. Then I dare &s;ay, you are no &s;tranger to Sir Gui&s;e Stuart:&mdash;there's a mon&s;ter of a man for you! I do not think there is man, woman, or child, in the whole world, that cares whether he is dead or alive."</P>
<P>"O yes, there is," continued the per&s;on, heavily &s;ighing, "more than one."&mdash;"May be you know mi&s;s Caroline, his daughter, &s;ir, as kindly, dutiful, and pretty a creature as ever broke the bread of life. God knows where &s;he is now; and I am acquainted with another as good and hand&s;ome as &s;he, who wi&s;hes this mon&s;ter of a man well: but I find it has all come home to him at la&s;t. Such a &s;tory did I hear of him ye&s;terday in London, at an old &s;ervant's of his, one Robert Irwin, where I went to take orders for the ca&s;tle from our Mr. Sir John, who has lodgings at Robert's:&mdash;&s;uch a &s;tory!&mdash;Ah good &s;ir, the wicked never pro&s;per long together. This very Sir Gui&s;e, is, I find, gone all to ruins, turned out of hou&s;e and home, and with five
<PB N="53" REF="63">guineas, which Robert, out of pure charity, put into his bundle, is now roaming about, God knows where. There is a change for you, &s;ir! yet how could he expect any better?"</P>
<P>"A change indeed!" cried his auditor with pathetic energy.</P>
<P>"Yes, re&s;umed the relater, "I would not have a, a, a,&mdash;friend of mine told of it for the world; nay, I would not wi&s;h any of our family to know of it, '&s;peciou&s;ly Squire Henry; and I am &s;ure, Mr. Sir John will not mention it to him for rea&s;ons good. The wicked man is going about under God's judgments: I &s;hould not at all wonder if we &s;hould hear in a little time he were hanged, &s;hould you, &s;ir?&mdash;And yet," continued the narrator, "poor man, I can't help pitying him. If I had not received orders from my ma&s;ter Mr. Sir John, and you know, &s;ir, when a &s;ervant has got his orders, he has only to do them outright in town or country, I &s;hould have tried to hunt him up; for though I think him the wor&s;t creature that lives, I have my rea&s;ons why I would not let him
<PB N="54" REF="64">want a mouthful of bread, and a drop of drink, and a bed to lie upon, while I had it of my own to give. He is now with the Almighty's angry finger upon him, for it is not us, but he, you know, &s;ir, to puni&s;h people; to my thoughts, &s;uch a wicked man as Sir Gui&s;e Stuart is more to be pitied than an hone&s;t man in the time of his trouble: becau&s;e you know, &s;ir, con&s;cience &s;ays &s;uch comforting things to the one, while the other can find nothing but taunts and torments within and without. And now I'll &s;ay no more about him; for you mu&s;t know, we never mention his name, nor have not done a long while at the ca&s;tle; and for my part, I &s;ometimes wi&s;h the abbey was &s;unk under ground, that none of our folks might look at it, then we might be happier even than we were. Indeed I &s;hould not have run on thus now, for I am no very great talker; but as I heard you &s;igh, and as I think a man had better &s;igh for the di&s;tre&s;s and wickedne&s;s of another man than for his own, and as I imagined you liked to hear rather than &s;peak, I have gone on. See, &s;ir, day is beginning
<PB N="55" REF="65">to break. Come, good &s;ir, we &s;hall have the &s;un up pre&s;ently, and then we &s;hall be able to look about us."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to conceive any mortal man in a more comfortle&s;s &s;ituation than Sir Gui&s;e Stuart during the time this harangue was carrying on by the &s;peaker, with a mo&s;t &s;incere hope of affording him relief. In all the &s;imple truth of an hone&s;t heart, he here heard him&s;elf at once commi&s;erated and de|&s;pi&s;ed. The cau&s;e and effect of all he had &s;uffered was placed in natural order before him, and all this from a man who avowed him&s;elf in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, but whom he knew at the &s;ame time, to be arrayed in all the maje&s;ty of virtues, which made the once lofty Baronet &s;hrink in the compari&s;on. The only favourable circum&s;tance was the dark|ne&s;s, which had veiled him from the eye of his accu&s;er, and that darkne&s;s was pa&s;&s;ing away.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="66">The morn had no &s;ooner rendered objects di&s;tinct, than it appeared to the companion of Sir Gui&s;e, that he had been addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a quaker. This accounted at once for the little that had been &s;aid in reply, and that little expre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much energy of pity for the guilty wanderer; moreover, the di&s;gui&s;e was more friendly than the wearer of it had conjectured, for the harang|uer, even when the deciding beams of the &s;un &s;hone full upon every thing, had not the mo&s;t remote &s;u&s;picion that he was in company with the man he had delineated. The ca&s;e was rever&s;ed with re&s;pect to the delineator, who not having an atom of di&s;gui&s;e about him, body or mind, was in&s;tantly di&s;covered to be True George, who had upon the whole, more rea&s;on to quarrel with the conduct of Sir Gui&s;e, than any of tho&s;e whom its crook|edne&s;s had involved, but who was perhaps, among&s;t tho&s;e that mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionated him.</P>
<P>About an hour after the &s;un had ri&s;en, the vehicle made its u&s;ual &s;top to breakfa&s;t. George opened the door, leaped out, and with the re&s;pectful manners that marked his
<PB N="57" REF="67">character, took off his hat and offered his arm to his companion, then directed a waiter to &s;hew the gentleman into a parlour, and mode&s;tly betook him&s;elf into the kitchen.</P>
<P>Our unfortunate knight now meditated an e&s;cape from his fellow-traveller, by in&s;inua|ting that he was arrived near the end of his journey, and that he would perform the little that remained on foot.</P>
<P>As he was projecting this over the fir&s;t cup of tea, the coachman made his appear|ance with the purcha&s;e-money of the coat, which he laid upon the table, and then &s;aid, pointing to a &s;mall packet of letters tied to|gether, "and I &s;uppo&s;e, friend, the&s;e are your property, at lea&s;t they were found in the great-coat pocket and are of no &s;ervice to me."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e on receiving them, read on the &s;uper&s;cription of the outer letter his own name and addre&s;s, and remembered &s;hifting them from the dre&s;s he gave to Smith at the Hand-in-hand. "Very well," ob&s;erved he with an air of attempted indifference, "you may lay them down there, they are of no
<PB N="58" REF="68">con&s;equence." "That you know be&s;t. Friend George, the young man who rode with you, &s;aid, he thought they were, and talked of coming in to a&s;k you whether you can give him any tidings of the per&s;on they are direct|ed to. You know him no doubt, or el&s;e you would not have &s;o many of his letters to keep. He is but a bad bargain be where he will, and I wonder you quaker-folks &s;hould have any thing to do with him: but that is none of my affair, friend; your &s;ervant, the hor&s;es will &s;oon be ready:&mdash;I will keep my word;&mdash;you may ride as far as you like. I wanted George to read one of the letters to us, but the devil a bit. I don't &s;uppo&s;e that fellow would read a word now of a letter that had not his name at top on it, an' though it were all again&s;t him&s;elf. I never &s;ee'd &s;uch a chap: we'll make ha&s;te wi' breakfa&s;t. We've a long pull yet, and all up hill; &s;o I'll now go and take a &s;up with George, and then jehu!"</P>
<P>The moment the coachman departed, the Baronet, who had been groaning in &s;pirit at the mention of the letters, turned to a large
<PB N="59" REF="69">gla&s;s that hung on one &s;ide of the room, and thought he could place the wig and hat to much greater advantage. To which end he took them ha&s;tily off, and was ju&s;t folding his own hair &s;o as to make it lie &s;moother under the wig, when with nimble, yet re|&s;pectful &s;teps, True George came running in, and &s;aw the very man he was going to make &s;o many enquiries after; &s;o that in&s;tead of a&s;king the &s;uppo&s;ed quaker what was become of Sir Gui&s;e, it would have been more in point to have enquired of Sir Gui&s;e, what he had done with the quaker?</P>
<P>The di&s;may of Sir Gui&s;e was not incon|&s;iderable, but the per&s;on by whom he had been detected, had not talent, or at lea&s;t no reli&s;h for that &s;ort of ridicule which expo&s;es misfortune, however merited; and to inflict pain, was as oppo&s;ite to his nature, as to de&s;erve its infliction on him&s;elf. "Ble&s;s God! then," &s;aid he, "you are found with|out looking for you any further: as to your dre&s;&s;ing like a quaker, &s;ir, I can ea&s;ily gue&s;s you would wi&s;h to be any thing but Sir Gui&s;e: and as to what I have &s;aid of you, &s;ir, I wi&s;h
<PB N="60" REF="70">it was not true with all my heart; but we may as well pretend to &s;ay it is night when it is broad day; truth is truth."</P>
<P>"For God &s;ake leave me!" &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, powerfully moved, "let me &s;top here."</P>
<P>"No, not here: no, no, get into the coach again, and then if I may ride with you, &s;ome|thing may be thought of;&mdash;&s;ee, &s;ir, the hor&s;es are put to, and the coachman will be here in a moment. Come, I will help to put your head to rights again. So,&mdash;that's good, &s;o much for the wig,&mdash;there,&mdash;now for the hat.&mdash;Now you are as good a quaker again as ever you was."</P>
<P>The good-natured fellow had ju&s;t made him up, when the coachman came with his &s;ummons. "Coachee," &s;aid he, "the gen|tleman is &s;o kind as to permit me to keep my &s;eat in the in&s;ide a little longer, and &s;o with your leave, I'll"&mdash;"Aye, that you &s;hall, Mr. George, and welcome, though I were to pay for you an in&s;ide from London to Plymouth." George gave him his hand in thanks; then out of that abundant loving|kindne&s;s with which his blamele&s;s heart
<PB N="61" REF="71">overflowed, he opened the coach-door to Sir Gui&s;e, as he had done before, and got in after him.</P>
<P>Whether attracted unawares by the charm of integrity and worth, as it was con&s;picuous in this e&s;timable young man; or whether urged by motives of de&s;pair ari&s;ing from a &s;urvey of his own &s;ituation, brought about by varied duplicity; or whether his heart was pre&s;&s;ed by a load that impelled him in mere relief to di&s;burthen it&s;elf; Sir Gui&s;e, at length, treated George with a candour to which that heart had long been a &s;tranger. "O! Mr. True," &s;aid he, "after what has pa&s;t it would be vain to conceal my deplora|ble &s;tate any longer; and I will, therefore, in this de&s;olation of my affairs, a&s;k you what cour&s;e you think I can pur&s;ue to &s;ave me from the world and from my&s;elf?"&mdash;He then unfolded the whole of his di&s;a&s;trous adven|tures; and concluded by ob&s;erving, that to undergo again all that he had &s;een, heard, and endured, for the three pa&s;t days, would be wor&s;e than death; &s;ince every moment of that time had proved to him he had not a
<PB N="62" REF="72">friend on the face of the earth, and con|vinced him he did not de&s;erve one.</P>
<P>The degree of &s;elf aba&s;ement to which a human being mu&s;t be reduced before &s;uch a forlorn declaration can be extorted from him, cannot ea&s;ily be imagined. It pre&s;uppo&s;es a condition &s;o de&s;titute, that perhaps before the idea of it can gain admi&s;&s;ion into the mind of man, all that &s;u&s;tains, or elevates his nature, mu&s;t have taken its flight; yet the confe&s;&s;ion could not have been tru&s;ted to a heart more full of good faith and charity, than that of the hone&s;t creature, who heard, and who could not but believe it was as &s;incere in the feeling, as he had but too many rea&s;ons to know it was true as to fact.</P>
<P>A more daring offender, or more properly to expre&s;s our&s;elves, a man with like aban|doned principles, but &s;u&s;tained by more con|&s;titutional audacity than Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, as in the ca&s;e of his compeer Valentine Miles, might have re&s;i&s;ted the rapacious tyranny of a pro&s;titute, exalted into a wife; he might have contended with all the viprous train that envenomed that alliance: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="63" REF="73">of more animal courage, he might have an&s;wered force by force, foiled &s;tratagem by &s;tratagem; and, by uniting the &s;pirit of the tyger with the wiles of the fox, he might have &s;truggled for his rights, &s;uch as they were, and perhaps regained them. But find|ing him&s;elf be&s;et on all hands, and &s;trongly pur&s;ued even by the bea&s;ts of prey that had fed upon his honour, peace, and fortune, his heart died within him and he fled.</P>
<P>True George was for many a mile as taciturne as he had been before loquacious: at length he fervently ejaculated&mdash;"The Lord have mercy upon all mi&s;erable &s;inners! Oh! Sir Gui&s;e, I would not be you for all that is on the face of the earth, or at the bottom of the &s;ea."&mdash;To this another long pau&s;e &s;uc|ceeded, which made Sir Gui&s;e &s;uppo&s;e that even this genuine child of pity had aban|doned him. But the &s;ame principles that in|duced the worthy adherent of the Fitzortons to attempt the relief of a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tranger in di&s;tre&s;s, by conver&s;ation that might be|guile the way, led him to pre&s;erve &s;ilence, now that per&s;on was known, le&s;t he might
<PB N="64" REF="74">advert to any thing which could increa&s;e affliction.</P>
<P>He did not again break &s;ilence till he knew by contiguous objects that he was approach|ing &s;cenes which mu&s;t greatly increa&s;e the &s;hame of his convicted fellow traveller: A little to the left &s;tood the hall of the good Partington, and the comfortable farm-hou&s;e of the bounty-guarded Atwoods&mdash;the fa|mily of the injured Jane were almo&s;t in view.</P>
<P>"I think Sir," ob&s;erved George, drawing a green blind before the window of the coach, at the &s;ide on which the&s;e objects lay&mdash;"I think, Sir, the light may be rather trouble|&s;ome, and the country to your right, ju&s;t where we now are, is more open than this to the left." In this remark the good creature had no view whatever but to prevent the in|fliction of pain to a heart already over|charged; for every lineament of the Baro|net's countenance, the former comeline&s;s of which we have before particularized, de|noted, beyond all que&s;tion, variety of &s;uf|fering. But the de&s;ign of the good-natured
<PB N="65" REF="75">George being thus an&s;wered, another long &s;ilence took place; at length leaping at an idea that made him &s;tand almo&s;t upright in the coach, he exclaimed, "I have it, Sir! I have it!" and then a fourth pau&s;e, as if to &s;hape and arrange this new idea. "Good heaven!" thought George, "and is this poor &s;inful being without hou&s;e, home, money, or friends? and not any body to &s;peak to him but his con&s;cience, which mu&s;t needs be angry with him? Why he has nothing for it but to knock him&s;elf on the head to get out of his own way, and that would not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e either; for he is no more fit to die than to live: yet if he &s;hould lay violent hands on him&s;elf now that all the world frowns on him, as to be &s;ure he de&s;erves, I &s;hould never re&s;t in my bed, nor, perhaps, would &s;omebody el&s;e either; and &s;he might even hate me for letting a poor wretch die in his wickedne&s;s, when by a little chri&s;tian charity I might have made him live to repent."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="66" REF="76">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH were &s;ome of the reflections that occupied the mind of George during tho&s;e &s;tops in conver&s;ation, which the con&s;cience of the per&s;on, who was the cau&s;e of them, tran&s;lated &s;o differently.</P>
<P>But the journey was now almo&s;t performed, and &s;ome deci&s;ive mea&s;ure was to be pur&s;ued. "Sir Gui&s;e," &s;aid George, "it does not &s;ignify talking; while a man is in the world he mu&s;t live, whether he is good or bad; I am but a &s;ervant, and you are a Baronet, but as you don't &s;eem to know what to do with your&s;elf at this pre&s;ent &s;itting, will you be ruled by me?"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e a&s;&s;ured him he would; but that he did not care what happened to him.&mdash; Truly to &s;peak, the Baronet was &s;unk to a degree &s;o extreme, that fear and hope equally for&s;ook him, and he might have been led about at the plea&s;ure of enemy or friend.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner, therefore, had George, who had been watching the mile &s;tones, with his
<PB N="67" REF="77">head out of the window, gained the &s;pot, than he called to the coachman to &s;top, jumped out of the vehicle, hat in hand, as before, and when Sir Gui&s;e had followed him, "Will," &s;ays he to the driver, "I find the quakerly gentleman does not cleverly know the road he is to go, and may lo&s;e his way, except he is with &s;omebody that can help him out a little; we &s;hall go together, and if we &s;trike into the foot path at the end of that lane, we &s;hall &s;ave near two miles; and as the gentleman is rather &s;ick with his ride, a little walking may do us both good: So I wi&s;h you a good journey, Will, and many thanks for your kindne&s;s. Our ca&s;tle has al|ways &s;ome good ale in it you know: Good|day, though it's getting dark enough to &s;ay good-night."</P>
<P>While George was talking to the coach|man, Sir Gui&s;e had an opportunity to look about him, and, however fatigued, it was not without con&s;iderable anxiety, that he per|ceived he was at a point that conducted both hor&s;e and footman by a bridle way, or a cut acro&s;s the fields, either to that pari&s;h which
<PB N="68" REF="78">was once his own, or to that which &s;till ap|pertained to the Fitzortons. His apprehen&s;ive nature caught alarm at this, and he fearfully a&s;ked George if he was going to di&s;cover him? condemning his own ab&s;urd feelings for &s;uffering him to be drawn &s;o near the place in the world he would mo&s;t avoid.</P>
<P>"As to that, Sir," ob&s;erved George, "I take it all places are pretty much alike to you ju&s;t now, only I have my rea&s;ons why I think that where I am going to take you to will be the be&s;t; as to di&s;covering you in that dre&s;s, I don't think that your own poor dear bani&s;hed child, mi&s;s Caroline, nor &s;omebody el&s;e I know in the world, could make you out in that dre&s;s, if you keep your hat and wig on: For," added he, "you are no more like what you was, in any &s;hape, than you are like my &s;quire Henry, God love his heart! and be&s;ides you promi&s;ed me for once you would be ruled by me." "And &s;o I will," &s;ighed out Sir Gui&s;e, following George, who had been getting through the lane all the time he conver&s;ed: "Only one thing I have to ob&s;erve, Sir," re&s;umed George, "as
<PB N="69" REF="79">&s;oon as I have hou&s;ed you, where I mean, you mu&s;t let me run off to deliver Mr. Sir John's orders at the ca&s;tle, and when I have done there, for I am but a &s;ervant as I &s;aid, I will come and &s;ee you &s;ettled better."</P>
<P>"As you think fit," an&s;wered the humi|liated Baronet.&mdash;" Then plea&s;e to take hold of my coat, and pull at it as much as you will I'll get you on.&mdash;Hark! we &s;hall now hear how time goes&mdash;Is that your clock or ours?&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;is that from the abbey or ca&s;tle? But that's no matter. 'Tis &s;ix o'clock you hear. How &s;hort the days get! Another quarter of an hour, and our no&s;es will &s;mell the fire I hope, and &s;ee the faggot &s;parkle, and hear the kettle &s;ing to make us a di&s;h of tea.&mdash;All you have to do is to mind your wig and hat; leave the re&s;t to George. O'd! &s;ave us! if all men that an't &s;o good as they &s;hould be, were to be kicked into the &s;treets to &s;tarve, I don't, for my part, know what would become of the be&s;t of us; the more wicked a man is the more time he wants. God knows very well what he is doing, and throws a man a plank, when the
<PB N="70" REF="80">man him&s;elf thinks he mu&s;t go to the bottom. Mayhap now I may be one of tho&s;e planks, and &s;o catch hold of me Sir Gui&s;e, and let us jog on. One thing is for certain, you can't be wor&s;e off than you are, and you mu&s;t own you may be a great deal better&mdash; Mind that I'll call you&mdash;I'll call you&mdash;what &s;hall I call you? We mu&s;t have no more Sir Gui&s;es at pre&s;ent. And yet what &s;ignifies lying?&mdash;I'll call you nothing only &s;ay, 'Sir,' and the 'quakering gentleman,' who travel|led with me, though 'tis ten to one if we &s;ee any body to-night, but a per&s;on who can't know you, and her &s;ervant-maid who is a new-comer, and who don't know you from our father Adam."</P>
<P>This ambulatory di&s;cour&s;e was accompa|nied by &s;uch encouraging tones, that the drooping &s;pirit of our helple&s;s adventurer could not but be cheared, even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t cutting humiliations.</P>
<P>"There, Sir, now get over this &s;tyle, and you are on your own&mdash;no I beg pardon&mdash;on the abbey ground&mdash;but we mu&s;t leave that and turn more to the right&mdash;Aye, aye, come
<PB N="71" REF="81">out Mrs. Luna, as my &s;quire Henry calls you, though he has many more fine names for you, madam Cynthia, mi&s;s Phoebe, and the like&mdash;He's one of your poet gentlefolks you know, Sir, and &s;o I believe is his lady madam Olivia. Come out then, and we &s;hall &s;ee our path plainer. Keep always to the right&mdash;Look'e the ca&s;tle is all to the right. There's the lights about it&mdash;ble&s;s its old face! I have not been away but four days, and long to &s;ee it again&mdash;Look, look, how the lights are moving about the rooms. Don't you &s;ee them through the dear brave old windows. That yonder is madam my lady's apartment: And that ju&s;t over it is a room where&mdash; where another of the family &s;leeps&mdash;Heigh ho! hark how the dogs begin to bark!&mdash;Don't be afraid, mo&s;t of them are fa&s;t: But if they were all loo&s;e they all love me, ble&s;s you; and, therefore, whoever is along with me, that's George's friend, they'll think, poor fools. By the &s;ame token don't you re|member poor little Fitz? The old ca&s;tle to my thoughts always looks gay at night|time, ju&s;t as if 'twere full of luminations.
<PB N="72" REF="82">But what a &s;ad figure the poor old abbey cuts of late years!&mdash;&s;ee not a farthing candle: &mdash;hang it what am I &s;aying?&mdash;I'm talking like a fool!&mdash;but the &s;ight of home always puts me in &s;uch &s;pirits they run away with me.&mdash;But do you &s;ee a candle through that cop&s;e&mdash;that's blind Goody Brab&s;on's, one of our madam Olivia's father's old &s;ervants, pa&s;t work now.

For my part I as much believe he put it into my head to take you to Goody Brab&s;on for a night or &s;o, till we could turn about, as if I had heard his voice. It does one's heart
<PB N="73" REF="83">good, and '&s;pecially when one lies in bed of a dark night to think you hear God Almighty's voice. I hope you will hear it one time or other. I mean in the way I &s;peak of; not as they &s;ay wicked people often do. O! then a clap of thunder mu&s;t be nothing to it; even though nobody el&s;e can hear it!"</P>

<P>SUCH conver&s;ation carried them over the flowery meads, and along the moon-light paths of Fitzorton, with the u&s;ual expedition of True George, who bore the half-fainting burthen of the pa&s;&s;ive Sir Gui&s;e at his &s;kirts; and they &s;oon arrived at the little neighbour|hood of cottages, which were among&s;t the many good works of Henry and Olivia, to employ their fortune and their time &s;ince their union. That the&s;e cottages might be under the immediate eye of their founders, they had been erected only a quarter of a mile di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle, and received, either from their patron or patrone&s;s, a &s;miling vi&s;it almo&s;t every day.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="84">"This is Goody Brab&s;on's, Sir," whi&s;|pered George; "'twas not her having no eyes, but her having a good old heart, got her here.

O! here is Sally the maid&mdash; &s;o Sally, where's Goody? and how does &s;he?
<PB N="75" REF="85">here's a gentleman travelled down with me who an't &s;o well as he &s;hould be, and can't go farther to night for fear of getting wor&s;e: &s;o I have brought him here to have Goody's &s;pare bed. He can have that, Mr. George; but Goody is in bed, and &s;he has been in bed the&s;e two days. Madam and the &s;quire have been here to &s;ee her but now, and were to &s;end &s;omething which I expect every minute." "Poor Goody, I hope &s;he'll be better to|morrow," &s;aid George. "I mu&s;t go home now with my orders: but I'll be here betimes in the morning."</P>
<P>This whi&s;pering dialogue was held in the pa&s;&s;age, and Sally was ju&s;t de&s;iring the &s;tranger to &s;tep into the parlour while &s;he aired a pair of &s;heets, as the latch of the hou&s;e door was lifted up, and in came two per&s;ons who brought their well-come in their hands; for each bore a ba&s;ket of the good things of this world. As Sally ad|vanced with the light to meet them, the one proved to be a fellow-&s;ervant of True George's, and the other the object of his fir&s;t and la&s;t pure affection, Jenny Atwood.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="86">"O! my good gracious!" exclaimed the latter, re&s;igning her &s;hare of the plea&s;ing bur|then to Sally, "how glad I am to &s;ee you come back!" which a&s;&s;everation was con|firmed by her throwing out both her hands to George, who, on his part, was hurried out of all things el&s;e&mdash;indeed out of him&s;elf; by that a&s;&s;urance, and the &s;udden &s;ight of the &s;ole object of his heart. "But how is it you did not come fir&s;t to the ca&s;tle: what does this mean, hey, Mrs. Sally?" que&s;tioned Jane, &s;miling; "perhaps you can an&s;wer me that que&s;tion&mdash;yes, yes, I &s;ee how it is: Mr. George likes a cottage better than a ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>This playfulne&s;s, which &s;incere and unex|pected &s;atisfaction called forth, was &s;oon checked by &s;ympathizing enquiries after Goody Brab&s;on, for whom, &s;he &s;aid, the lady Olivia had &s;ent a little of every good, and would her&s;elf repeat her vi&s;it in the morning.</P>
<P>All this time George was drawing Jane and her companion nearer the door. "Well, then," &s;aid he, "we had better make the
<PB N="77" REF="87">be&s;t of our way home now, as I have orders to deliver from Mr. Sir John.&mdash;Hope &s;quire Henry and my lady are well, Jenny?"&mdash; "Charmingly," &s;aid the latter, "thank heaven!&mdash;well and happy.&mdash;"God keep them &s;o!" an&s;wered George&mdash;by this time in the garden, Sally following with the light.&mdash; Good-nights were now plentifully exchanged; and after George had de&s;ired Sally to re|member what he had &s;aid to her, and to make things as comfortable as &s;he could for the &s;ick,&mdash;pronouncing the la&s;t words very emphatically&mdash;he &s;et off with the two me&s;|&s;engers of bounty for the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The beams of the moon have &s;eldom &s;hone on three worthier per&s;ons; for the &s;ervant who made the third, was one who had, from his earlie&s;t youth, lived in the family of the Clares, and had been among&s;t the mo&s;t &s;elect of tho&s;e who had been trans|ferred to the ca&s;tle for his good behaviour, on which account there had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a friend&s;hip betwixt him and True George.</P>
<P>When our loving trio, therefore, had gained the &s;tep-ladder kind of &s;tyle, that led
<PB N="78" REF="88">by a back way to the ca&s;tle, "Do you know," &s;aid George, "that the fir&s;t thing I did when I got within &s;ight of our hou&s;e was to give a look at your chamber window, Mrs. Jane; and I could not help &s;aying to&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash; per&s;on that was with me&mdash;"A per&s;on?" que&s;tioned Jane, "you had company then,&mdash; one of the neighbours I &s;uppo&s;e,"&mdash;" no&mdash; no&mdash;yet 'twas a neighbour too&mdash;that is."&mdash; "Hoity toity!" cried Jenny, re&s;uming her &s;portive &s;u&s;picion, "why you &s;eem in a flurry, George&mdash;If poor Goody Brab&s;on had not been &s;ick in bed, I &s;hould have thought that pretty Mrs. Sally had taken a moon &s;hiny walk to meet you."&mdash;George laughed: "Aye, you may laugh, Mr. George," ob&s;erved the fellow-&s;ervant, "but lads, even though they have been in London, like a pretty country la&s;s by the light of the moon, as the &s;ong &s;ays, &s;pecially when they are new faces. But I can tell you friend George, if you go moon-lighting to Goody Brab&s;on's Sally, you'll &s;tray upon my grounds.&mdash;"O, ho! is that the ca&s;e," &s;aid George, repeating his laugh.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="89">The&s;e little rebounds of jocularity, which were rare indeed with Jane Atwood, but which were excited by returning health, &s;omewhat better &s;pirits, the benevolence of her late errand, the unexpected &s;ight of her pre&s;erver, and the continuance of comfort at the ca&s;tle, which they were now approaching. Henry and Olivia Fitzorton, attracted by the mild beauty of the evening, and yet more by the ardour of their generous hearts, had walked forth arm in arm to meet the me&s;|&s;engers of their loving kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Scarcely had the enquiries, re&s;pecting the health of Goody Brab&s;on, been made, and an&s;wered, when a di&s;covery of their-favourite dome&s;tic&mdash;who&s;e return they did not expect for &s;ome weeks, as he had been lent to their brother John for a month&mdash;brought on inter|rogatories &s;even-fold. The&s;e, al&s;o, being an&s;wered with only a little mental re&s;ervation in George, touching his delay&mdash;which was &s;et down by the queri&s;ts to the account of love, though the reader knows it proceeded from a le&s;s &s;elfi&s;h nature&mdash;the whole party went &s;atisfied into the hou&s;e: Henry and Olivia

<P>HOW far the wretched object of our good Samaritan's bounty was capable of en|joying the comforts, thus procured, may be ea&s;ily conjectured, as well as with what emo|tion he mu&s;t have ari&s;en at the return of day. He beheld from the chamber window of the widow womar, that man&s;ion, the very path to which had, by one atrocity or another, been formerly watered with the tears of his vic|tims, and the man&s;ion it&s;elf converted into a hou&s;e of mourning. Nor did the mi&s;ery of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations yield to tho&s;e which mu&s;t &s;courge his heart at the pro&s;pect of his own ruins. Goody Brab&s;on occupying a corner-hou&s;e of the building, her &s;pare bed-room had a remote view of the abbey, particularly of tho&s;e invidious &s;creens of clay, and blank walls, which abject malice had reared, as has been noticed in the early part of this hi&s;tory,
<PB N="81" REF="91">to de&s;troy the pro&s;pect of the worthy dwel|lers of the ca&s;tle. This memorial of his mi&s;erable mind had been left either from neg|lect or inattention, even &s;ince part of the premi&s;es had undergone the benevolent and reforming hand of the excellent Olivia; and the &s;ight of it brought thus morally under his eye, &s;truck him as a monument which his own hand had erected to the di&s;credit of his unmanly character, But, perhaps, the acute&s;t &s;mart he had yet felt from the &s;ting of adver|&s;ity, was the &s;ight of the innocent girl he had attempted to de&s;troy in return for the pure virgin heart &s;he gave him: to &s;ee her too re|covered from his &s;nare, and likely to give happine&s;s to the very man on who&s;e charity her betrayer was thrown for bread.</P>
<P>But while the pro&s;pects of Sir Gui&s;e were thus dark and cloudy, tho&s;e of the compa&s;|&s;ionate youth, who had taken pity on him, were &s;carcely le&s;s perplexed and involved: His night was not le&s;s interrupted than that of Sir Gui&s;e, though from far different cau&s;es; and while his ruminating head yet pre&s;&s;ed his pillow, what, after all, he &s;hould do with the
<PB N="82" REF="92">man to whom he had been induced, by re&s;i&s;t le&s;s circum&s;tances, to promi&s;e protection? was the great que&s;tion. To mention him to any per&s;ons of the pari&s;h, as a proper object of their bounty, would, he knew, be madne&s;s; to di&s;cover him to Henry Fitzorton would be, perhaps, to revive images which it had been the labour of years to keep under: to breathe an accent that &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s Jane Atwood with the &s;ecret, would be wild and ra&s;h: yet, &s;ome active mea&s;ure mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, and that without delay.&mdash;"He cannot remain where he is now," &s;aid George, "more than a few hours." He remembered that Olivia had promi&s;ed Goody Brab&s;on a morning vi&s;it.&mdash; He knew, be&s;ides, that the former was an early ri&s;er, while autumn had a flower to be&s;tow towards the making up her Henry's breakfa&s;t bouquet&mdash;a cu&s;tom &s;he had never for&s;aken, when health and the &s;ea&s;on permitted, &s;ince the exchange of the flowers of Henry's fancy, for tho&s;e of the garden, on the memo|rable anniver&s;ary of her birth.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations drove George from his bed at the dawn of day, by which he
<PB N="83" REF="93">gained nothing more than the being in readi|ne&s;s to follow up any favourable plan that might offer it&s;elf to his revolving mind.&mdash; "The wor&s;t of it is that I could not," &s;aid he, "have picked up and brought home any man but this in all the world, whom our family would not have been willing to keep out of trouble: but for Sir Gui&s;e Stuart!&mdash; I don't know a &s;oul&mdash;except, indeed, one who mu&s;t not know of it&mdash;who would not as &s;oon &s;ee almo&s;t the devil&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;in their hou&s;e as he.&mdash;Heigho! I don't know what's to be done with him, that's the truth of it. And yet one man &s;hould not let another man &s;tarve, or drive him on to more wickedne&s;s neither. There is &s;ome|thing &s;hocking in that."</P>
<P>Here &s;ucceeded a cogitating fit of another hour, when the ca&s;tle clock &s;triking &s;even, &s;tartled him for the condition of Sir Gui&s;e, who would think him&s;elf neglected, and, perhaps, be thrown into de&s;pair. "O! what <HI>&s;hall</HI> I do with him? where &s;hall I hide this poor mi&s;erable &s;inner? Money I could give, and food I could buy, but a hou&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="94">&mdash;What <HI>&s;hall</HI> I do for a hou&s;e to put his head in?"</P>
<P>As he a&s;ked him&s;elf this la&s;t que&s;tion he had &s;at down at his window, from whence he ob&s;erved Olivia already in the garden. It was her cu&s;tom on a beautiful morning, &s;uch as then it was, to glide from her apart|ment without di&s;turbing any body; for the comfort of her whole hou&s;ehold&mdash;in all which that word of the greate&s;t importance in family arrangements, was the point which both &s;he and her hu&s;band de&s;ired to gain&mdash;and is, indeed, one of the mo&s;t rare to be &s;een in the annals of dome&s;tic life&mdash;namely, SUPERIORITY OF STATION, but EQUALITY in HAPPINESS.</P>

<P>AFTER Olivia had taken two or three turns up and down the &s;hrubbery neare&s;t the hou&s;e, and had marked the fragrant objects of her morning-offering, &s;he &s;truck into the path that led to her cottages. George no &s;ooner perceived this, than he left his room, pur&s;ued her &s;teps with incredible &s;peed, and having overtaken her, followed the impul&s;e of the moment, and with fainting eagerne&s;s addre&s;&s;ed her thus. "God knows, my lady, whether I have done right or done wrong."&mdash; "Right, I dare &s;ay, my good fellow," an&s;wered Olivia, a little &s;tartled: "but what is the matter?" "Right or wrong, my lady, it can't be helpt now; I have met with one of my dear ma&s;ter the Squire's enemies, and your lady&s;hip's enemy, and Mr. Sir John's enemy,&mdash;my enemy,&mdash;Jane Atwood's ene|my, and I believe every body's enemy upon earth:&mdash;but I met him, my lady, unawares,&mdash; the &s;ight of him took away my breath, almo&s;t my &s;en&s;es,&mdash;and &s;carcely knowing what
<PB N="86" REF="96">I &s;aid or did, I,&mdash;I,"&mdash;"Heaven's what!" demanded Olivia, "what did you do? not murder him, I hope?" "No, my lady, not murder him: though that I &s;uppo&s;e, is what a true &s;ervant ought to have done;&mdash; in&s;tead of which, I never touched a hair of his head, but contrary-wi&s;e, as I found he was ju&s;t at death's door, no food to eat, nothing to drink, and no bed to lie on;&mdash;all his fortune gone, and his heart ready to break&mdash;that, though I knew him to be one of the wor&s;t wretches that lives, and told him &s;o twenty times over, I could not bear to leave him as I found him,&mdash;and &s;o&mdash;pray, pray, my lady, forgive me. I e'en brought him home with me, got him into a bed; I know he had not been in one for &s;everal night's before; and,&mdash;do pray, forgive me: upon my &s;oul I could not help it,&mdash;I,&mdash;I,&mdash;I have him on the premi&s;es at this moment."</P>
<P>"Thank God, and thank you, my good George for it!&mdash;but who can you mean?&mdash; I have no notion of any of the per&s;ons you have mentioned having an enemy upon earth."</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="97">"Except him, my lady, or his gang, I don't think they have: but, for all that, as I &s;aid before, I have brought him among us, and u&s;ed him as if he was a friend."</P>
<P>"Well then, &s;uch treatment will, I hope, make him one: but you ob&s;erved, he was found in a di&s;tre&s;sful condition, and it could not be wrong to afford him your pity. I will ju&s;tify you by adding mine."</P>
<P>"If he had been the devil, my lady, and I had heard &s;uch &s;ighs and groans as I did, I &s;hould have done as I have. Not that I want to make him a burden to any body. 'Twas I brought him, and I'll take care of him. I only want a little hou&s;e-room &s;omewhere at hand, and nobody to know of it, my lady."</P>
<P>After this exordium, George related, ac|cording to his manner, every circum&s;tance of the ca&s;e, from his fir&s;t meeting with Sir Gui&s;e in the &s;tage-coach, to the introduction of him at Goody Brab&s;on's, with the contin|gent adventures of encountering Jane Atwood. "Therefore, do pray, my lady, excu&s;e my boldne&s;s in taking &s;uch a kind of a per&s;on into your Eden; you may think it is as bad
<PB N="88" REF="98">as the devil thru&s;ting him&s;elf in Eden of old: but God help us, my lady! if all wicked &s;inners were to be hunted from one place to another, and then were to be le&s;t to roam about the world, why they would run at us like mad bulls for want of a re&s;ting-place, and &s;omething to eat&mdash;for 'hunger will break through &s;tone walls:'&mdash;no, no, much better to my thoughts, give them wherewithal to lay their head, and a little victuals to eat: and as they are not &s;it for better company, let them &s;way them&s;elves; and though to be &s;ure, my lady, you can't, as the &s;aying is, make a &s;ilken-pur&s;e out of a &s;ow's-ear: yet, if by a little kindne&s;s, under God's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, we could get but &s;ome of the devil out Sir Gui&s;e before he gives up the gho&s;t, why that would be no &s;mall matter. You know, &s;ome folk who were once a little out of the right path have come into it again. You and I, my lady, know &s;omebody who is now a pattern for any lady in the land to cut out by; heigho!&mdash;and though this wicked, aban|doned &s;inner, whom, I cannot tell you half what I think of, never can be fit to touch the
<PB N="89" REF="99">hem of that &s;omebody's garment,&mdash;you know who I mean, my lady&mdash;he may take up a little, and a chri&s;tian &s;hould try to do good, or el&s;e what &s;ignifies their being chri&s;tians: and we are bid every &s;unday, your lady&s;hip knows, 'to rai&s;e up them that fall.' God knows Sir Gui&s;e is fallen low enough. O do, do then, my lady, let you and I try to rai&s;e old Sir Gui&s;e up without a &s;oul being the wi&s;er; for after all is &s;aid and done, God knows what help the be&s;t of us may want before we go out of the world."</P>
<P>Olivia chilled and glowed at various pa&s;|&s;ages in our child of nature's account, and at the comments his &s;imple and upright heart made on it; and although &s;he did not know all the dark and deadly offences of Sir Gui&s;e, &s;he knew more than &s;ufficient to engrave his name even on her forgiving heart, in charac|ters never to be era&s;ed. Abhorrence of the &s;in, but by no means to the exclu&s;ion of pity for the &s;inner. She therefore a&s;&s;ured George that &s;he &s;o entirely approved of all he had done, not only in regard to the relief he had offered, but in the &s;ecrecy of it, that &s;he
<PB N="90" REF="100">&s;hould readily join him in all his worthy endeavours. "The only matter," ob&s;erved &s;he, "that will dimini&s;h our &s;atisfactions, is the impo&s;&s;ibility of calling in on my part, my beloved Henry, or the amiable Jane on yours; as, though I am convinced they would both a&s;&s;i&s;t, and take delight in a benevolence of this kind; you are &s;en&s;ible there are rea|&s;ons why we mu&s;t at pre&s;ent, refu&s;e our|&s;elves and them this &s;atisfaction, to &s;ee the father of his dear Charles Stuart, and of my Caroline, degraded and reduced, would &s;hock too much my dear hu&s;band's gentle nature: and, alas! you know, though ble&s;&s;ed be God, in general much re&s;tored, he has not &s;trength to bear &s;urprizes of any &s;ort."</P>
<P>"As to that," interrupted George, "I know, my lady, that only the thought of what this wicked creature may one of the&s;e days come to, has often been too much for Mrs. Jane, and if &s;he &s;hould know that day was come already, and that he was but the day before ye&s;terday without a bit of bread in the world, or a bed to lie on, and now on the&s;e premi&s;es, I &s;hould fear wor&s;e would
<PB N="91" REF="101">come of it than even what happened in the wood. Do you know, my lady, if it had not been for &s;taying on my errand, I &s;hould have taken him back to London, where I fir&s;t met with him in this mi&s;erable way, and put him out to board and nur&s;e, ju&s;t as one would a baby; but thinks I, what is to be done with my orders from Mr. Sir John? they may or may not be of con&s;equence: that is nothing to a &s;ervant: an order is an order. It an't his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;top, and if he is &s;ent &s;ometimes on a fool's errand, that is nothing to him, he is not the fool. Had it not been for this, can any body go to think I would have let him come here, betwixt two fires, as a body may &s;ay, the abbey and the ca&s;tle? I am &s;ure when Jane came in with your lady&s;hip's comforts for Goody&mdash;lord love your heart! though I am always &s;o glad, I could cry like a child to &s;ee the face, or to hear the pretty voice of Jane Atwood&mdash;don't you always think &s;he has a nice way of &s;peak|ing, my lady?&mdash;I was frighted almo&s;t out of my wits, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould find out the make|believe &s;ick quaker, for all his brown wig and
<PB N="92" REF="102">&s;louched hat: though to be &s;ure, as I told your lady&s;hip, I could never have hit them off my&s;elf if they had been on: no, not if I had been a year in his company, which, God forbid I ever &s;hould be; for if he could have gone about the world without falling into the clutches of &s;ome of his own gang, even though he had not a farthing in the world, don't think, my lady, I would have brought him even within fifty miles of either the ca&s;tle or the abbey!&mdash;no, my lady, I would have given him what money I had to &s;pare, and kicked him out of my company as I would a football, or a nui&s;ance, or what not."</P>
<P>"My good George," exclaimed Olivia, "your mention of the abbey has put a thought into my head, about a place for this poor wretch: you know the abbey is now ours on lea&s;e, and though Henry and I have made a point of delicacy and feeling, not to go into it, and as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible to walk near it; which could only revive the thoughts of its former &s;tate, when graced by Caro|line and Charles; and though I have ever locked up the key to keep it out of the &s;ight
<PB N="93" REF="103">of the friends who loved tho&s;e dear unhappy wanderers, whom my continual re&s;earches could never find; there were &s;ent, you re|member, &s;ome few beds and other general conveniences into the upper part of the building, by way of temporary ho&s;pital when the &s;mall-pox raged &s;o cruelly in ours and &s;ome neighbouring pari&s;hes; and the par|ticular apartments which were fitted up for our apothecary, the worthy Mr. Burton, whom we engaged to inoculate as many as friends or parents cho&s;e to &s;end, were directed to be proper for the reception of a gentleman. I have an hundred times had it in my mind to order this furniture to be turned to &s;ome u&s;e, had not the dread that attaches to every idea of the unfortunate abbey, made me lay a&s;ide the thought, but I &s;hall now be very glad if you imagine they might an&s;wer our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: for it will be ea&s;y to get one of the cottagers who does not know Sir Gui&s;e, to attend him. I only mean this for a &s;hort time, till we can think and con&s;ult each other about a le&s;s expo&s;ed &s;ituation. My only fear is, that the dreadful change he will find in
<PB N="94" REF="104">every thing from the day, alas! when a good and dutiful family &s;urrounded him, may grievou&s;ly oppre&s;s his heart: yours and mine it would break in a moment; neverthele&s;s, if we are the authors of our mi&s;eries and di&s;|graces, we mu&s;t try to bear them. The matter is, will this temporary abode do?"</P>
<P>"Do, plea&s;e my lady," ejaculated George, who had been &s;having off the exce&s;&s;es of his eager nature upon his nails, buttons, and neckloth, and twitching every thing in his way, &s;ince the idea was &s;tarted. "Do, my lady! yes, it will do wonders! let me have the key&mdash;let me have the key; I'll abbey him, to&s;s up his bed, boil his kettle, throw him on a faggot, open a &s;a&s;h or two, give him the bible and te&s;tament, lock him up again, put the key in my pocket, and &s;o feed him and leave him, and leave him and feed him, ju&s;t as I would an old fox, or a &s;ick kite, or any other wild wicked thing I had picked up, and did not like to knock on the head. As to his finding a great change, that is what he &s;hould do: for if he were to be made as gay and great as he was before, I
<PB N="95" REF="105">&s;hould fear he would get to his old pranks again. No! no! I'll tell him to ble&s;s God and your lady&s;hip it is no wor&s;e, and then if he growls, I'll &s;ay, mend your&s;elf wherever you can, for God knows you want mending bad enough; and even if he &s;hould be &s;een, as I'll always take care to leave him wigged and hatted, quaker-fa&s;hion; why &s;hould he not pa&s;s for a &s;ad, &s;ick, &s;orry, poor man, who has as much occa&s;ion for an ho&s;pital as another? I am &s;ure there will be no &s;tory in all that."</P>
<P>Long before our benevolent dome&s;tic had got to the end of his &s;peech, Olivia had turned her light &s;teps towards the ca&s;tle: George pur&s;uing her track and his remarks, which latter fini&s;hed ju&s;t as the walkers had gained the &s;pacious &s;tone entrance into the great hall. There, de&s;iring George to wait a few moments, Olivia a&s;cended the lofty &s;tair-ca&s;e that led to the upper apartments. Tho&s;e few moments were employed by the Hermes-footed George to collect the hi&s;tory of the morning; he heard that Henry had not yet come down; he &s;aw that Jane
<PB N="96" REF="106">Atwood was plea&s;ingly bu&s;ied in the nur&s;ery with Olivia's children; her own little one, of unfortunate memory, was, perhaps, luckily, among the victims to the ravages of the very di&s;order which occa&s;ioned the con|verting part of the abbey into an ho&s;pital, that was now to become a charity-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He got back into the hall ju&s;t as his lady was coming down &s;tairs, and, &s;milingly de|livering what &s;he went for, wrapt up loo&s;ely in a paper, &s;he begged he would remember her name was not to be on any account men|tioned to the quaker, but whenever nece&s;|&s;ary to be con&s;ulted, &s;he would be ready. "And now," &s;aid &s;he, "I mu&s;t go make up my &s;lowery tribute for the be&s;t and deare&s;t of men." "And I," &s;aid George&mdash;reflect|ing a playful air and &s;entiment from his mi&s;tre&s;s, "mu&s;t go and put out of &s;ight my bundle of weeds: for I think&mdash;an' plea&s;e you, my lady&mdash;&s;o we may call our &s;ham-quaker, whom, to my thoughts, is ju&s;t as bad as Squire Henry is good."</P>
<P>"Pray tell Goody Brab&s;on," &s;aid Olivia, as &s;he and George were &s;eparating, "I will
<PB N="97" REF="107">call on her after breakfa&s;t, and indeed this fair morning, I mean to make the tour of Eden's buildings, and pay a how-do-ye vi&s;it to all my dear cottagers. I hope," added &s;he, "my hu&s;band and our children will accompany me. My Henry looks &s;o very happy when we are on the&s;e &s;trolls, and I wi&s;h to make the little ones as like their father as po&s;&s;ible. Adieu, George. I &s;hall keep Henry and Jane Atwood to my&s;elf, at lea&s;t for an hour to come, &s;o you will have time to put your &s;tray &s;heep into the fold."</P>
<P>The &s;mile with which the &s;peaker accom|panied this, ju&s;t as &s;he took her way again into the flower-gardens, and the tear which the hearer dropped in her path, are two of the many things in this world to be felt, and not de&s;cribed. We can only offer it as our firm belief, that as the one was &s;weeter than the faire&s;t of the flowers Olivia Fitzorton could hope to cull; the other was fo&s;ter than the dews that wait upon and increa&s;e their fragrance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Gui&s;e Stuart, meanwhile, a pri&s;oner in the chamber, was literally a partaker of the widow's mite, which indeed like her's of &s;acred &s;tory, was &s;upplied by a &s;ource that would never &s;uffer her cru&s;e of oil to wa&s;te, nor her mor&s;el to fail. He had for &s;ome hours expe|rienced all the horrors of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and appre|hen&s;ion, &s;uperadded to the mi&s;ery of &s;urround|ing pro&s;pects, and the &s;evere reviews of his own mind upon them. He had &s;een from the we&s;tern window of his apartment True George, and Olivia Fitzorton, the wife of the man who had &s;o many rea&s;ons to execrate his tyranny. They were in earne&s;t conver&s;ation, walking backwards and forwards, with what, to his &s;ickly fancy, appeared angry and complot|ting &s;teps; and having no rule to judge by in the mea&s;ure of generous actions, he did not doubt but that he was to be given up to the malignant triumph of a family, who&s;e hone&s;t di&s;dain he had &s;o often experienced; and he now rebuked his own credulity for
<PB N="99" REF="109">having thus &s;uffered him&s;elf to be trepanned into the cu&s;tody, of even more powerful ene|mies than his wife and her a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e injurious contempla|tions, True George, coming in with a ba&s;ket under his arm, changed their direction from the per&s;ons accu&s;ed to the illiberal accu&s;er: and yet there were &s;ome gleams of returning grace in the latter, ob&s;erving, "I am afraid, Mr. George, I have wronged you." "O yes," replied George, "that you have Sir Gui&s;e, and every body el&s;e in our family often enough, but that is nothing; good for evil, you know, is be&s;t: &s;o if you wi&s;h to have a &s;nug birth in your own hou&s;e that was, and there live quiet, and be &s;een only by me, till we find what can be done, and how matters turn, why you will come along with me;&mdash; hat and wig clo&s;e tho', or we &s;hall have all the pari&s;h about your ears, and about mine too, for bringing you among&s;t them. Nay, now don't &s;tand thinking about it: needs mu&s;t, you know, Sir Gui&s;e, when the devil drives, and I'm &s;ure he is driving you hard enough: and now if I can but put you in the way of
<PB N="100" REF="110">preventing his carrying you clear off to the otherworld, and there ca&s;ting you into a much wor&s;e place than I am going to take you to, why I think I &s;hall have done a pretty tight job. But it gets late, and I mu&s;t hou&s;e you before people are abroad. If you &s;hould once be &s;een it will be all over with us."</P>
<P>Independently of other rea&s;ons, this latter &s;ugge&s;tion was all-&s;ufficient to quicken the Baronet. He repaired his di&s;gui&s;e, while George went down with the lady Olivia's me&s;&s;age to Goody Brab&s;on; who, in an&s;wer to kind enquiries, &s;aid, &s;he was much re|covered; and in a very few minutes after, Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the rich domain through which he was now to pa&s;s, &s;et forward under the patronage of a &s;ervant, and that the &s;ervant of a man he had irrepara|bly injured, for the man&s;ion which, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods of his life, had been the &s;eat of his tyranny and of his di&s;grace, and was now to be his refuge from penury and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t evils, however, the commi&s;e|rating George, notwith&s;tanding, at &s;ome
<PB N="101" REF="111">moments, his hone&s;t indignation at the re|membrance of pa&s;t vice got the better of his pity for pre&s;ent wretchedne&s;s, did all he could to blunt the edge of. On the way, he explained to Sir Gui&s;e as much as he could, without committing Olivia, the arrangement which had been made for his uninterrupted &s;ecurity, and for his &s;up|port. George acquainted him, that though he mu&s;t con&s;ent for the &s;ake of his being &s;afe, to be his &s;ole and ab&s;olute pri&s;o|ner; yet, that by the time he had amu&s;ed him&s;elf with what he had brought in that ba&s;ket, he would be forth coming again. "In a few days, the weather will, I &s;uppo&s;e," cried George, "make us look about us for a good fire, and that you &s;hall not want. You will be lonely to be &s;ure: but then that is better than wicked company, and you know you could not have even that now, if you had all the world before you: &s;o that, in the main, you are, to my thoughts, better here than any where el&s;e: &s;o try, Sir Gui&s;e, to make it &s;it ea&s;y, and as I have a hundred things to call me away, I wi&s;h you good
<PB N="102" REF="112">thoughts till I &s;ee you again; but I mu&s;t not forget to tell you I have put a good book or two in the ba&s;ket."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e alleviations, and the comfort to be derived from a compari&s;on of the pre&s;ent with the pa&s;t, the &s;ituation of Sir Gui&s;e was truly forlorn. He eluded, it is true, the haunts of his robber-wife, and of all her loo&s;e companions; the wiles of the bailiff were no longer to be dreaded, the day no more exhau&s;ted in wandering, or the night &s;pent in the public &s;treets, or in commixture with tho&s;e who infe&s;t them; the apprehen&s;ion of famine, and the terror of meeting in every face a foe, were al&s;o at an end; all the&s;e he had e&s;caped, but his &s;eclu&s;ion from the &s;pecies, offered him full lei&s;ure to become acquainted with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the du&s;k of the evening, George paid his pri&s;oner a &s;econd vi&s;it, and mentioned more particularly the plan of his e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. Being in a hurry, however, he &s;aid little of the internal furniture of the abbey, except to ob&s;erve, that though Sir Gui&s;e would, doubtle&s;s, find great alterations in it, the
<PB N="103" REF="113">whole range of it would be at his command, and what it might want in other re&s;pects would be made up in perfect &s;ecurity. "You are &s;afe," ob&s;erved George, "not only be|cau&s;e I &s;hall always have the key of you in my pocket, but becau&s;e you mu&s;t know there is not a man, woman, or child, in the three pari&s;hes, who could be per&s;uaded to put their heads into this hou&s;e be&s;ides my&s;elf, even if the doors were left wide open: for the &s;tory goes, that the hou&s;e is haunted by the troubled &s;pirit of your dead lady, who comes from the little chapel where &s;he is buried, and walks all over the rooms every night, and has been &s;een go in from the tower at the top, and &s;o get down one of the chimneys; though as to that, they can as ea&s;ily fly in at a key hole, as if the &s;a&s;h was left up on purpo&s;e,&mdash;but that's nothing;&mdash;you would not be afraid of your dead wife, if you were to &s;ee her; &s;he never did you any harm when &s;he were living in this very abbey; and I dare &s;ay, if &s;he might be permitted, for I am told, &s;ir, apparitions have their orders, and may not do always what they
<PB N="104" REF="114">like&mdash;&s;he would, if &s;he were here this mo|ment, rather pity and moan over you, and do &s;omething to &s;hew you &s;he forgave you, and wi&s;hed you well, than to hurt or frighten you. "See, &s;ir," continued George, "I have brought you &s;ome candles, and a tinder-box: we will have a light in a minute;&mdash;aye, and I have a bottle of wine for you, as good as any in Fitzorton cellar: and here's a pair of &s;heets for your bed, as fine as my lady her|&s;elf lies on. I can tell you, I've had a good look out to bring them off without being &s;een. There&mdash;we've got a light, you &s;ee: but the wind does &s;o &s;cud about the&s;e old apart|ments, there is no keeping in a candle. I think it feels dampi&s;h too. To morrow I'll get in &s;ome wood, and you can have a fire; 'tis a blu&s;tring night, is not it, &s;ir? but what is this to the nights you have made Squire Henry and I pa&s;s in the woods about this e&s;tate! Bad as you may think the room where you are, I'd have given ten year's wages to have got my poor ma&s;ter into it, in&s;tead of which, there has he &s;tood for hours in the middle of the night, in hail, rain, or
<PB N="105" REF="115">&s;now, to look at the place where his heart's fir&s;t love was. O, Sir Gui&s;e! Sir Gui&s;e! Sir Gui&s;e!&mdash;but we mu&s;t not think of the&s;e things; he is very happy now, but where is &s;he, poor thing!&mdash;O, Sir Gui&s;e! Sir Gui&s;e! well, I'll &s;ay no more. You look &s;adly pale, do take a gla&s;s of wine, it will chear you up a-bit; there, &s;ir,&mdash;and look'e, here are &s;weet bi&s;cuits: O, if you knew who made them! and a cold fowl, and a neat's-tongue, and in &s;hort, a little of every thing: and a nice clean cloth too. I'll make you up a &s;upper in a minute, and you may either eat it while I go put the &s;heets on the bed, or you may take it after I am gone."</P>
<P>"Stay as long as you can, George," &s;ighed the Baronet, "I will, &s;ir," replied George, "and am &s;orry I can't be oftner with you, or longer at a time; for indeed, Sir Gui&s;e, I am very &s;orry to &s;ee you in this way, and to leave you in it all to your&s;elf: I could hardly keep from crying as I went away from you in the morning; after all, &s;aid I, it mu&s;t go very hard with a gentleman who has lived as he has lived, and had once a hou&s;e full of good
<PB N="106" REF="116">people about him, to come to this!&mdash;but I'll get a good bed ready, that is always a com|fort to a man; have you found one that &s;uits you, &s;ir?"</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e dejectedly, "I have &s;carcely &s;tirred from this room &s;ince you left me."</P>
<P>"There's a good one &s;omewhere I am told, and I'll find him out as &s;oon as I've lighted another candle. But you have not yet drank the wine I poured out, do pray, &s;ir. There&mdash; I know it will do you good, for it is Ma|deira, and older than I am:&mdash;&s;o, now for the bed."</P>
<P>The different movements of Sir Gui&s;e's &s;oul during this di&s;cour&s;e, and the reflec|tions that preceded and followed it, had &s;o de&s;troyed every bodily con&s;ideration, that the unhappy man &s;at ab&s;tracted from all thoughts of &s;u&s;tenance, though for many days pa&s;t, he had not been compo&s;ed enough to enjoy one comfortable meal. On George's return, he &s;aw, for the fir&s;t time, the cheeks of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart bathed in a torrent of tears. His worthy attendant&mdash;forgetting that
<PB N="107" REF="117">the object of his care had ever offended either God or man&mdash;felt his pure heart &s;hake within him at the &s;ight, and as he gazed on the quivering lip, &s;treaming eye, and dimi|ni&s;hed figure of the Baronet, "O, good dear &s;ir," he cried, "don't be ca&s;t down, don't be di&s;heartened, pray, pray, don't. God is very merciful, and bringeth light out of darkne&s;s; only look in that book, &s;ir, I brought you this morning, particularly where he &s;ays that, 'he de&s;ireth not the death of a &s;inner, but rather that he &s;hould turn from his wickedne&s;s and live!' and moreover that, 'the &s;inner who repents, is better than ninety and nine per&s;ons who have never been guilty.' How comfortable that is! Would to heaven, good father Arthur were here now!"</P>
<P>"Have you found any bed?" que&s;tioned Sir Gui&s;e, "I do not feel very well."</P>
<P>"I am afraid, &s;ir, you are very ill; but, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, I hope you will be better to-morrow; perhaps you would like to get into bed before I go, &s;ir."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="118">"If you plea&s;e," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, ri&s;ing with difficulty.</P>
<P>"Take my arm, Sir; but pray one more gla&s;s of wine&mdash;at any rate we'll take the bot|tle with us&mdash;you may wi&s;h for a little in the night. I have got you a decanter of nice water fre&s;h from your own pump; and made out things as well as I could. All this is woman's work you know, Sir. I am but an aukward chamber-man&mdash;But I'll do the be&s;t I can, I will indeed; and will help you to pray to God, with all my &s;oul, to make you better every way."</P>
<P>George had, in the cour&s;e of this &s;peech, and the intermediate pau&s;es which he made, con|ducted, or rather carried Sir Gui&s;e through many apartments to that where he had pre|pared the bed, being the room fitted up for Mr. Burton at the time of the inoculation, and which Olivia had mentioned. At the moment of entrance Sir Gui&s;e drew back.&mdash; "I wi&s;h you had not happened to fix on this chamber," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"None of the others have &s;o good a bed," replied George.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="119">"I &s;hould have preferred them neverthe|le&s;s," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e in broken accents&mdash;"but 'tis no matter."</P>
<P>George retired till the Baronet got into bed; then a&s;ked Sir Gui&s;e if he could do any thing more for him? a&s;&s;uring him that he would remain with him all night, but that it would be noticed at the ca&s;tle, and &s;poil all. He then de&s;ired to know whether he cho&s;e to have the candle left burning, or be put out. "O, put it out," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, "I can change my room to-morrow.</P>
<P>"I will put the &s;heets on another bed if you think you &s;hall &s;leep more comfortably. I think nothing of the trouble," &s;aid George.</P>
<P>"It does not matter for to-night," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, "perhaps it is better as it is."</P>
<P>"Then good re&s;t to you, Sir; and may God hear your prayers, as I hope he will mine. Your name will be in all of them, I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir."</P>
<P>The good creature drew the curtain, re|peating his greeting, but did not leave the chamber, or the hou&s;e, till he had put all things in order&mdash;&s;o that in ca&s;e Sir Gui&s;e
<PB N="110" REF="120">&s;hould ri&s;e before he could return in the morning, he might not want any accommo|dation the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances af|forded.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE apartment hinted at by Sir Gui&s;e, was that in which he had fir&s;t received the blooming form, and la&s;t ob&s;erved the pallid corp&s;e of lady Stuart his wife, and to which the bed and furniture, he had &s;een at Robert Irwin's formerly appertained; and it was the impre&s;&s;ion made by this latter circum&s;tance, a&s;&s;ociated with other affecting ideas, which produced his reluctance to &s;leep there.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and promi&s;cuous and polluting &s;cenes might have pa&s;&s;ed in that apartment &s;ince; when the &s;ons and daughters of di&s;&s;i|pation held their midnight revels at the abbey; but confederate guilt derives confi|dence from example, imitation, and num|bers: the terrors of the individual are &s;ilenced or put to flight by general audacity: far removed from the&s;e, Sir Gui&s;e Stuart was
<PB N="111" REF="121">now thrown upon him&s;elf. In the abode of his former enormities he was left to pa&s;s the night where dreadful &s;ights had been &s;een, and tre|mendous &s;ighs had been heard&mdash;even in that chamber where all that was lovely, and in|tere&s;ting in life, had felt his cruel arm, en|countered his furious eye, and a&s;&s;ailed his unpitying ear.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ympathy of painful as of plea&s;|ing ideas, that with the&s;e &s;eemed to a&s;&s;emble in the mind of Sir Gui&s;e, a thou&s;and others no le&s;s afflicting. Memory brought forward, in terrible array, the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive images of his atrocious hypocri&s;y: and the different, yet dire events of the little chapel of the inn at Ad&s;ell, of Edgecombe-hall, and of the Atwoods, came hurrying into the retro&s;pect&mdash;at once the figures of all tho&s;e whom he had wronged &mdash;a numerous band&mdash;poured upon his affrighted fancy. The wind had ari&s;en, and howled with more than u&s;ual violence through the almo&s;t empty apartments. Sir Gui&s;e re|gretted that the candle had been extingui&s;hed. Heavy pau&s;es of death-like &s;ilence were &s;uc|ceeded by vehement bur&s;ts of the hurricane,
<PB N="112" REF="122">in which the loo&s;ened tiles fell into the areas, the ca&s;ements rattled, and &s;ome of the doors &s;lapped to and fro amid&s;t the chaos of &s;ounds. He imagined he could di&s;tingui&s;h human voices at one moment loud, and menacing, at another in moaning and whi&s;pered complain|ings. To the&s;e his fears, his fancy, and his con&s;cience, gave appropriate per&s;ons. It was now the faultering accent of the dying Matilda; then of the injured Sir Armine; now the groans of Charles; and then again the &s;woonings of Caroline. Exhau&s;ted by continued exertion he &s;unk into a momen|tary doze, out of which he &s;eemed to be arou&s;ed by a legion of furies that bore to his di&s;tempered mind the &s;hapes of Valentine Miles and his colleagues, led on by the furi|ous lady Tempe&s;t. In the mid&s;t of a con|flicting &s;truggle with the&s;e, he thought he di&s;tinctly heard foot&s;teps paceing along an adjoining apartment. Unable to &s;upport the &s;hock of this idea he leaped from his bed, and opening a door, that led from the &s;ound, he ran through the rooms which lay in the ea&s;tern direction of the abbey, where &s;top|ping
<PB N="113" REF="123">awhile, and every noi&s;e &s;eeming to cea&s;e, he &s;ought about for &s;omething whereon to repo&s;e. After traver&s;ing the place in vain &s;everal minutes, he perceived he had got into a part of the abbey which had always been left unfurni&s;hed; but he at la&s;t found a &s;eat which projected from the window, and &s;at down. The wind had much abated, and a heavy &s;hower of rain falling &s;oon after &s;ank it to a perfect calm&mdash;all was &s;till without, and a dreary &s;ilence prevailed within. En|couraged by this, he was ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, in the hope of returning to his bed, when the noi&s;es &s;uddenly were renewed, and to his infinite terror he heard one of the antique folding-doors, of a &s;pacious apartment be|neath, open and clo&s;e. Sinking down again on the bench with affright, he ob&s;erved from the window, which commanded a view of &s;everal of the rooms in the &s;econd &s;tory, a light moving from room to room with a &s;trange celerity that chilled his blood. Such was its &s;peed that, like lightning, it caught his eye only by fla&s;hes. Sir Gui&s;e left the room, and, without knowing what path to
<PB N="114" REF="124">take, ran forward by hazard rather than de|&s;ign; but turning to the left, he recovered the &s;uite of rooms from which he had wandered, Making a trembling pau&s;e, in one of the&s;e, he heard a voice reverberate in hollow echoes one unvaried kind of cry. On lifting his eye to the window, he perceived the &s;ame light going as it were before the voice. The light vani&s;hed, the voice continued&mdash;in a &s;hort time the &s;ounds came evidently nearer, and in their advance rendered them not more loud than di&s;tinct: Sir Gui&s;e &s;oon heard his own name pronounced, and repeated with a vio|lence that denoted at once mi&s;ery and de&s;pair. A heart more intrepid, and le&s;s criminal, than that of our reclu&s;e, might have quaked at this &mdash;a noi&s;e, as of one running di&s;tractedly for|ward, accompanied the voice&mdash;the door of the apartment where Sir Gui&s;e &s;tood, &s;upporting him&s;elf by one of the pillows of the chim|ney, opened abruptly, and the figure of a man, bearing a light, ru&s;hed in, &s;till repeat|ing the name of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart.</P>

<P>THESE terrors, which certainly wanted not the power of guilt to render them more terrible, proceeded only from True George, who, on reaching the ca&s;tle, had an unob|&s;erved opportunity to inform Olivia of the manner in which he had placed, &s;erved, and left their mutual charge.&mdash;"Yet I don't think, my lady, the poor man will get any &s;leep, there does not &s;eem a wink in his eyes, nor indeed any thing el&s;e but tears."&mdash;Olivia expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that before George had gone off with his ba&s;ket, &s;he had thought to have put into it a cordial, which had proved of &s;uch u&s;e to her beloved Henry whenever he &s;uffered for want of &s;leep. "I am &s;ure it would have procured him a good night's re&s;t, which, in any mi&s;ery you know, my good George, is a balm from heaven."&mdash;"It is too late now," continued Olivia, "to-morrow morning, my good George, you &s;hall take it to him."&mdash;"I am &s;orry your lady&s;hip thinks it is too late, for I don't; and when the &s;quire
<PB N="116" REF="126">is gone to bed if you plea&s;e, my lady, to give the good &s;tuff to me, and tell me how much our poor quaker &s;hould have at a do&s;e, I'll &s;tep with it to the abbey; and if I &s;hould find him a&s;leep, as I &s;hall not make much noi&s;e, why I'll leave him as I found him, and it will be ready for another time."</P>
<P>"But you &s;tand in need of re&s;t your&s;elf, my poor fellow," &s;aid Olivia.</P>
<P>"I do &s;o," an&s;wered George, "but to my thoughts I ought never to wake again if I were wicked enough to go to bed till I had carried a poor &s;inful &s;oul, locked up by him|&s;elf in a huge hou&s;e, like a de&s;erted town, &s;omething to give him &s;trength to go on praying God to make him better."</P>
<P>Olivia gave him the cordial with due di|rections, and George &s;et out ju&s;t as the &s;hower began to fall, for a &s;econd nocturnal excur|&s;ion to the abbey. On his arrival he unlocked the great door, and opened every other with the greate&s;t caution, pa&s;&s;ing with &s;tealing &s;teps through the &s;everal long apartments, till he reached that in which he had left the Baro|net: but his con&s;ternation at finding it
<PB N="117" REF="127">empty, aggravating his fears, brought to his mind the condition in which he had parted from his pri&s;oner, e&s;pecially the regret he had expre&s;&s;ed at &s;leeping in that apart|ment, and made him adopt &s;ome of the &s;uper&s;titious, and horrible things &s;uppo&s;ed now to infe&s;t the abbey. He ran through every room in the ca&s;tle, lantern in hand, till he found what he &s;ought in the manner, and condition we have recorded.</P>
<P>Long and reiterated, however, were the efforts of the protector of Sir Gui&s;e, before the latter could be re&s;tored to &s;en&s;e or motion; and it was lucky that the gentle, and con&s;ide|rate Olivia had added a &s;melling bottle of re&s;toratives to the cordial. By the application of the former the wretched man &s;ufficiently recovered to di&s;tingui&s;h the per&s;on who a&s;|&s;i&s;ted him; and this producing confidence, he was, in due time, able to be conducted back to his bed, by the &s;ide of which George &s;at, and having dimini&s;hed fear by gradual expla|nation, his charge was at once compo&s;ed and grateful. "Now then, your Honour, for a little of this good &s;tuff, which a good friend of mine
<PB N="118" REF="128">&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;a per&s;on of my ac|quaintance, who would not hurt a worm&mdash; gave me, and which will make you &s;leep like a top, and &s;o it ought, &s;eeing the time my bringing it has kept you awake."</P>
<P>George mixed up the cordial-draught, ac|cording to rule and mea&s;ure, in half a gla&s;s of the Madeira; and after Sir Gui&s;e had taken it, our good dome&s;tic &s;eated him&s;elf by the bed-&s;ide to watch its operation.&mdash;"I hope there will be no more noi&s;es, Mr. George," &s;aid the Baronet faintly&mdash;"as to noi&s;es, I'll tell you what, I never believed in the&s;e &s;ort of things in my life, till I came and &s;aw you had left your warm bed, which, in the condition you were, I thought nothing but the devil him&s;elf could have per&s;uaded you to do&mdash;and I own when I could neither &s;ee nor hear any thing of you above or be|low, I began to imagine you were really car|ried off; and con&s;idering all things, one could not have wondered at it if you had. But now I have found you again, I come back to my old thoughts, that there are no candles going about without hands of fle&s;h and blood
<PB N="119" REF="129">to carry them, and no noi&s;es by day or night, but what are made by poor mortals, like you or I. A man's con&s;cience, to be &s;ure, will conjure up the&s;e things, and a per&s;on had better be haunted by a whole church-yard of glari&s;h &s;pectres, as &s;quire Henry called them&mdash;yea, though there were to come one or more out of every grave, than be haunted by that:&mdash; Now don't you think &s;o?"</P>
<P>"I do indeed," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, pa|thetically.</P>
<P>"And, therefore, Sir," re&s;umed George, "never mind any other lights or noi&s;es."</P>
<P>"I think," &s;ighed Sir Gui&s;e, "I need not trouble you any longer, at pre&s;ent, as I feel heavy, and might, perhaps, &s;leep if I were alone."</P>
<P>"There then, Sir, is the &s;melling bottle on the chair ju&s;t by you: day is almo&s;t at hand, &s;o a candle will be of no u&s;e&mdash;I'll leave it, however, in the chimney i'the next room. I hope I &s;hall find you fa&s;t when I come again, but I'll not wake you; for to my thoughts 'tis one of the &s;ins to wake any body&mdash;Sleep is &s;uch a nice &s;oft comfortable
<PB N="120" REF="130">thing. Good morning, Sir, for 'tis long enough pa&s;t twelve."</P>
<P>George now again withdrew, but waited in and adjacent room till he had manife&s;t tokens of Sir Gui&s;e being in profound &s;lumber. The good youth, at length, went home, where he &s;ought his own pillow; and if con&s;cious goodne&s;s did not &s;oon after &s;eal his eyes, con|&s;cious goodne&s;s could alone be&s;tow the happy emotions that might keep them open.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>OLIVIA'S cordial draught had its full power on the corporal functions of her patient, for it produced an uninterrupted repo&s;e of many hours; indeed, of nearly the whole of the day&mdash;for the &s;un was gilding with its &s;etting rays the painted figures of his antique window as he aro&s;e from his bed.</P>
<P>But to what did he awake? The never|re&s;ting worm was at length feeding on the brea&s;t which had long defied its envenomed tooth. The hour was come when he could no more deceive him&s;elf or others. Conducted to
<PB N="121" REF="131">the chief &s;cenes of his iniquity,&mdash;the only ones, perhaps, in the whole range of the univer&s;e where con&s;cience could exert her&s;elf on a hard|ened heart: and &s;tretched ince&s;&s;antly on the rack of conviction, he was by degrees humbled by cha&s;ti&s;ement to renounce hypocri&s;y, even while he felt that he had in every other in&s;tance been a hypocrite.</P>
<P>Yet all that could be effected by per|&s;evering goodne&s;s and pity, was done by Olivia Fitzorton and True George; and the forlorn object of their cares had continued under their guardian&s;hip &s;ome months,&mdash;during which no &s;ights were &s;een or voices heard in the abbey, but tho&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion and good will. Yet the health of Sir Gui&s;e declined, and all the &s;ymptoms of a di&s;ea&s;ed mind were noticed in his conduct. He pa&s;&s;ed &s;ud|denly from a violent and tumultuous to a &s;et|tled malady on the &s;pirits. His intellects were no way impaired. His general melan|choly was increa&s;ed, but his raving pa|roxy&s;ms were le&s;s frequent. He roved at in|tervals over every apartment of the hou&s;e, and &s;eemed to live mo&s;t in tho&s;e which at
<PB N="122" REF="132">his fir&s;t &s;eclu&s;ion were avoided as objects of terror. The bed-chamber of lady Stuart, which had &s;everal times been changed for others, became at la&s;t his place of con&s;tant repo&s;e: tho&s;e of Caroline and Charles were vi&s;ited by turns; and in one or other of the&s;e his guardian George would often di&s;cover him bathed in tears.</P>
<P>He was one day found bu&s;ily employed in fa&s;tening up a &s;uite of apartments in the we&s;tern wing of the abbey, and on being a&s;ked the rea&s;on, with a brief a&s;perity that might have rather been expected from John Fitzorton, he an&s;wered&mdash;"becau&s;e they are accur&s;ed! They were my <HI>wicked</HI> wife's:" &s;o he had for &s;ome time pa&s;t called lady Tem|pe&s;t, to di&s;tingui&s;h her from lady Matilda Stuart, whom he termed <HI>ble&s;&s;ed!</HI> But, at length, he moved from the chamber of the former, becau&s;e, he &s;aid, he was unworthy to occupy it.</P>
<P>A report of all the&s;e changes was faith|fully made by George to Olivia: "But for all this my lady," &s;aid George, "the man mu&s;t die, unle&s;s he has &s;ome help be&s;ides
<PB N="123" REF="133">yours and mine. I can &s;ee plainly he wants a doctor; but the wor&s;t of it is we can't pa&s;s him off to any body of that &s;ort as a quaker, becau&s;e 'tis not now one time in twenty that I find him either wigged or hatted: He will &s;it you in the old green &s;ilk wrapper which he found, he &s;ays, in one of the lumber che&s;ts;&mdash;and which, he &s;ays, was &s;omething belonging to his ble&s;&s;ed fir&s;t lady, as he calls her,&mdash;and he has got &s;omething of a &s;a&s;h or girdle about his wai&s;t, that he one day told me he was &s;ure he had &s;een worn by mi&s;s Caroline&mdash;&s;o that whoever goes to attend him mu&s;t know him at once: not by his face neither &s;o much, for that's not like the &s;ame; but he talks about him&s;elf and his wicked|ne&s;s, and calls him&s;elf as great a villain, God knows, as he is! Oh! my lady, if you had heard what he &s;aid la&s;t night about Jane At|wood: &mdash;he &s;aid, &s;he was like an angel of light, and he like a fiend of darkne&s;s&mdash;poor man! I have thought better of him ever &s;ince I heard him &s;ay &s;o&mdash;But for &s;ure, &s;omething in the doctoring way he mu&s;t have, or he'll be gone."</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="134">"You terrify me, George; and why not let the good Mr. Burton go to him? He is hone&s;ty it&s;elf. In him we may confide, and nobody &s;ave him&s;elf will know but that it is one of his patients, afflicted with &s;ome di&s;order that requires he &s;hould be alone, which is, you know, alas! the truth,&mdash; and &s;o has borrowed a room in the abbey to place him within reach:"&mdash;"hey, my lady?" &s;aid George&mdash;"Yes, and even if my dear Henry &s;hould hear of it, for mine and his children's &s;ake, if the apothecary ob&s;erves it may be infectious, he will ea&s;ily be prevailed upon not to indulge his curio&s;ity, and there it will end."&mdash;"The very man, my lady! O! what a clever lady you are to think of him! not a &s;oul will know it from Mr. Doctor Burton I am &s;ure. I'll go to him the fir&s;t time I can &s;lip out for an hour; 'tis but a &s;tep of a few miles&mdash;But then, my lady, &s;hould we not tell Sir Gui&s;e about it? Poor Gentleman, we &s;hould take more care than ever now he's getting good not to throw him back again: Well, I'll take care
<PB N="125" REF="135">of that. Thank you, thank you, my lady, two heads are always better than one."</P>
<P>The point was &s;oon &s;ettled; the worthy apothecary was entru&s;ted, and his patient reconciled to receive his vi&s;its; and, indeed, it would not have been ea&s;y to have found a third per&s;on more fitted to the ta&s;k of con|&s;oling a &s;ick and &s;olitary reclu&s;e, than the good Burton. He was, truly, as the reader has &s;een in the &s;everal glances he has had of his manners and character, one of the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous, affectionate, true-hearted beings in the world, full of pity and forgivene&s;s, and by no means un&s;kilful in his bu&s;ine&s;s. By his own indu&s;try, fo&s;tered by his patrons at the ca&s;tle, he had contrived to bring up his very large family, though but a village apo|thecary, where, as Jonathan ob&s;erved, there were few people to be either &s;ick or &s;orry. Of two-and-twenty children there remained alive fifteen, but of the&s;e only the two daughters, and three of their younge&s;t bro|thers, were on his hands&mdash;the re&s;t of the males had been comfortably di&s;po&s;ed of by John, Henry, or James Fitzorton&mdash;the
<PB N="126" REF="136">females were provided for by Olivia. So that though the apothecary, from long habi|tude and attachment, remained in the little village where he had fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;till carried on bu&s;ine&s;s with his u&s;ual unre|laxed attention, even in the very &s;hop where laxed attention, even in the very &s;hop where Jonathan Arm&s;trong, in his ma&s;querade rags and &s;tumps, paid him a vi&s;it, he was con&s;i|dered as a man ri&s;ing above all dome&s;tic in|cumbrances, and laying by little yearly gifts and gettings for his children:&mdash;yet with a hand &s;o clean, and a heart &s;o open, that no hone&s;t di&s;tre&s;s within his reach, either of body or of mind, but found an advi&s;er and a friend in Mr. Burton of Brixom. And all this progre&s;&s;ive good fortune aro&s;e from the very &s;light beginnings of his interview with the pretended lame beggar, whom he followed to Fitzorton to return a &s;ixpence that was paid by a mi&s;take for the memorable bottle of hart&s;horn.</P>
<P>Slight, and &s;ometimes too nice for in&s;tant ob&s;ervation, are the means which bring about the mo&s;t important ends; as the proude&s;t rivers may have their &s;ource in the humble&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="137">vales, and i&s;&s;ue from the &s;cantie&s;t rills. It is true, that before Jonathan's adventure, our friend Burton was, upon principles of general benevolence, included in the bounty li&s;t of the ca&s;tle, as an oppre&s;&s;ed and &s;truggling man, to be occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted; but the <HI>&s;plendid &s;ixpence</HI> brought his heart into action and notice, and, by a&s;certaining its worth, created an intere&s;t for him in every lover of virtue. The drawing of the man had been looked at tran&s;iently before, it was then placed in an unfavourable light, but it was this &s;imple &s;ixpence that &s;hifted the picture to a &s;pot where its colours could be feen and be appreciated.</P>
<P>Prior to our apothecary's vi&s;iting Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, the diligent George had related to him &s;uch parts of the hi&s;tory of that unhappy outca&s;t as were nece&s;&s;ary to excite his entire commi&s;eration; &s;o that although Burton was among&s;t tho&s;e who had conceived the mo&s;t unqualified dete&s;tation of the Baronet's former practi&s;es, he was by no means prejudiced beyond the power of penitence to change
<PB N="128" REF="138">his &s;entiments in the proportion that the of|fender changed his life.</P>
<P>Although Burton had for &s;ome time pa&s;t been an almo&s;t daily vi&s;itor at the ca&s;tle, his being all at once ob&s;erved to take his ride, or walk, into the pro&s;cribed and de&s;olate abbey, excited general enquiry into his motive, but the rea&s;on hinted at by Olivia to George, and adopted by the apothecary, was &s;o natural, and, in effect, &s;o true, that the apprehen&s;ion of any epidemic malady not only prevented the enquirers from a&s;king any more que&s;tions, but made the &s;wains, and other per&s;ons of the &s;urrounding villages, go to &s;everal places by round-about paths rather than cut through the abbey pa&s;tures, or come within a mile of its &s;uppo&s;ed tainted air.&mdash; Indeed &s;ome thought it not very &s;afe to come into contact with Burton him&s;elf, and we know not whether his attendance on this one patient might not lo&s;e him many others; for the natural gathering of a &s;tory had increa&s;ed the malignity of the abbey invalid from a putrid fever to the &s;potted pe&s;tilence; and the good folks made it a kind of pari&s;h
<PB N="129" REF="139">bu&s;ine&s;s not to &s;end to Burton, if it could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided, till he had done with the man that had got the plague.</P>
<P>George, however, was ob&s;erved to ven|ture in more than once: &s;ome blamed his fool hardine&s;s, and &s;ome prai&s;ed his huma|nity; while others &s;aid, if he regarded not his own health, he had no right to hazard that of his neighbours; and the plague, they had under&s;tood, was a thing that, like a per|&s;on charmed, would kill at a touch,&mdash;nay, and at a mile di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thus then was the abbey under a double pro&s;cription; fir&s;t, on account of the vices of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart; and, &s;econdly, from the di&s;ea&s;es of a contagious man&mdash;perhaps had the country people known the man was that very Sir Gui&s;e Stuart him&s;elf, they would have held the man&s;ion in yet greater dread, and have left the county to &s;ettle beyond reach of the pe&s;t.</P>
<P>Our good apothecary, however, and True George, frequently met at the apart|ments of the Baronet, and took the active management of his health and comforts
<PB N="130" REF="140">between them; while Olivia, like &s;ome re|compen&s;ing, yet invi&s;ible power, &s;uperin|tended their office, and encouraged their zeal. Burton had contrived to fix in the abbey kitchen an old woman, who knew &s;omething of cookery, and who undertook to live in &s;ome of the rooms below, provided the <HI>plaguy</HI> gentleman would promi&s;e not to come near her; and on being &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured by the apothecary that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for her to catch it, while &s;he kept out of his way, and attended only to her own bu&s;ine&s;s, accepted the office. Nothing, however, could induce her to go near him. True George, therefore, continued the office of gentleman of the bed-chamber, and thus the economy of the hou&s;ehold was perfectly well &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The object of their cares, however, often wanted more than bed or board, or than all the drugs the <HI>materia medica</HI> could furni&s;h. His mind was &s;truck! his con&s;cience was in arms! and the &s;pirit of the man was departed from him!&mdash;yetevery chearing, every &s;u&s;taining art was tried, and &s;ometimes not without &s;ucce&s;s.
<PB N="131" REF="141">Now and then the apothecary would &s;educe him into a game of back-gammon, and &s;ome|times a&s;&s;i&s;t him to take half an hour's exerci&s;e in an area of the court yard, that was &s;haded from ob&s;ervation by the abbey wall. George would occa&s;ionally play him a tune on the flute, lead him into momentary &s;ports, tell him a merry tale, and by a thou&s;and ways beguile him from him&s;elf. The Baronet would often &s;peak his thanks by a &s;mile, but oftner by a tear. In general, however, he declined motion, though he found it difficult to re&s;t. He would take his &s;olitary rounds of the ca&s;tle, &s;hift his vi&s;its from the room of his Matilda to that of Caroline or Charles. He would pa&s;s lady Tempe&s;t's door with every mark of &s;corn, and once ventured with Burton to go into what had been the general breakfa&s;ting-room, and from thence into the library; but a &s;udden thought drove him ha&s;tily from both the&s;e, and the re&s;idue of the day on which he had hazarded this experiment, was unu&s;ually melancholy.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>IT was in that breakfa&s;ting-room, the imperious hu&s;band, and cruel father, had fallen upon his knees to CURSE the be&s;t and mo&s;t obedient of wives; and it was in that library, he had impo&s;ed his hard commands on the mo&s;t ob&s;ervant and dutiful of daughters. The bell with which he had &s;ummoned her into his pre&s;ence, was among&s;t the few fix|tures that remained, and as he ca&s;t his eye upwards to &s;urvey it, though the wires were broken, and nothing &s;eemed entire, but the part on which he had pre&s;&s;ed his tyrannic hand, it &s;truck his heart with a &s;ound more aweful than the knell of death. So acute is the memory of guilt when quickened by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But an impre&s;&s;ion more intolerable for him to bear, even than the&s;e, though accompa|nied perhaps, from its profundity, with le&s;s actual violence, proceeded from the unex|pected &s;ight of Jane Atwood at Goody Brab|&s;on's. Attached to this young woman were
<PB N="133" REF="143">&s;o many terrible tran&s;actions; the delu&s;ion of youth! the de&s;ertion of age! the lying lips! and the never-con&s;uming fire! the excellency of True George! who&s;e conduct &s;hone forth in the character of a protector, contra&s;ted with his own hateful behaviour as a &s;educer! Hence a glimp&s;e of the injured Jane, though but momentary, acted upon him as the com|mi&s;&s;ioned lightning acts upon its object, over|whelming the proude&s;t faculties of our nature, and pre&s;erving memory only to torture him with partial recollection of his crimes.</P>
<P>He had been under the infliction of feelings like the&s;e, &s;ome days, when, making his accu&s;tomed call, the apothecary perceived he had been writing, and finding him much agitated, "truly, my good &s;ir," &s;aid he, feeling his pul&s;e, "this will never do. You can do your&s;elf more harm in a &s;ingle hour, than I can do you good in a month: and unle&s;s you will pre&s;cribe a little for your|&s;elf&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir," replied his patient, with a feeble voice, but earne&s;t manner; "you can, on the contrary, contribute more to the
<PB N="134" REF="144">health of my body, and peace of my mind, in one hour, than I can in the re&s;idue of life."</P>
<P>"Then I am &s;ure, if I can, I will," &s;aid the good man ardently, "that is," a little correcting his warmth: "if I imagine what you have to propo&s;e will be really for your good, becau&s;e you know, my good &s;ir, pa|tients are not always the be&s;t judges of their own ca&s;e, nor of the remedies be&s;t adapted to their cure."</P>
<P>"But mine can be effected only one way," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, with augmented emotion. He then took from under his wrapper a written paper, which he read aloud, though in every line it criminated him|&s;elf. Often did he drop the &s;calding tear of &s;harpe&s;t remor&s;e upon the pages, and at length he exclaimed, "Oh! if you would ever wi&s;h me to remain long enough in this world, to make my peace in another, deliver this as it is addre&s;&s;ed. You know the rea&s;ons why I cannot a&s;k this favour of Mr. George: for though there are not any &s;enti|ments that can interrupt the happine&s;s of that
<PB N="135" REF="145">good young man, I have tried, in vain, to mention to him even the name of the injured girl to whom this letter is written: In pity take it, then, and grant my reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"I will, &s;ir," an&s;wered Burton, wiping his eyes and receiving the letter, after the trembling hands of the Baronet had folded it up again, and put under it a wafer. "I expect to &s;ee her this very evening: it is her birth day: we are all to meet on it, and drink to her health."</P>
<P>"Are you?" que&s;tioned Sir Gui&s;e, with quivering lips: "I,&mdash;I,&mdash;will drink it too; alas! alas! Mr. Burton!"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e &s;mote his brea&s;t, and it was a con&s;iderable time before the kind hearted apothecary could compo&s;e him. He re|mained, however, in his pious endeavour till long after the anniver&s;ary-fe&s;tival at the Fitzorton-arms was begun; he had &s;et apart that evening for gaiety and grateful plea&s;ure among&s;t his friends and benefactors; but he could not feel him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to enjoy &s;ociety till he had admini&s;tered to his now intere&s;ting &s;olitary, all the comfort in his
<PB N="136" REF="146">power to be&s;tow. What were the plea&s;ant events and di&s;coveries that awaited his heart, as if to reward him for his worthy deeds, previous to his joining the party, the &s;ympa|thizing reader already knows; and ju&s;t before the company broke up, he performed his promi&s;e, by giving the pacquet to Jane. At|wood: taking care to put it into an envelope, that the hand writing might not immediately be di&s;covered, and as he gave it into her hand, he &s;aid, "this is for your own pretty eyes; it is the ca&s;e of a patient of mine, and a friend of yours, who has long been in a very bad way, and who had been given over: but who, I am in hopes, will do better after all; if you can a&s;&s;i&s;t a little in the cure, I am &s;ure you will."</P>
<P>"From &s;ome of my lady's cottagers, I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Jane, putting the pacquet into her pocket; "I will certainly attend it, Mr. Burton, before I go to bed."</P>

<P>THUS, by a retro&s;pective view, having brought forward &s;ome principal figures, which had been a con&s;iderable time in the back-ground of this our family-picture, we will now carry back the pencil to a groupe, which, we feel a&s;&s;ured, will always be looked at with complacence, whether painted in the deepe&s;t &s;hades of di&s;tre&s;s, or in the gaye&s;t colourings of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The honoured, and, &s;urely we may now be permitted to call her, the honourable Jane Atwood,&mdash;after crowning the long fidelity of her worthy lover with hopes that filled his hone&s;t heart with joy,&mdash;was no &s;ooner left alone, than &s;he took from her pocket the pacquet, concerning which the good apothe|cary had excited her curio&s;ity; nay more, had moved her pity. But what were her emotions, when, on opening the envelope, &s;he &s;aw the well-known characters of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart! Since the hour of her e&s;cape from the ra&s;h action &s;he had committed on
<PB N="138" REF="148">his account, &s;he had never &s;uffered even his name to pa&s;s her lips; and being at length thoroughly convinced of his unworthine&s;s, &s;he had exchanged the &s;ofter &s;entiment in his favour, for as much of di&s;like as was con&s;i&s;tent with a nature &s;o gentle as hers.</P>
<P>But the very addre&s;s of the letter,&mdash;'To the mo&s;t injured, from the mo&s;t penitent,'&mdash; was, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to create very power|ful feelings; this intere&s;ting &s;uper&s;cription, however, did not occa&s;ion a moment's balance in her mind on what to re&s;olve, as to the letter it&s;elf. "I hope," &s;aid &s;he, "from my &s;oul, that it is dictated by penitence; but be the motive of writing it what it may, worlds &s;hould not tempt me now to read it; and &s;urely it was wrong in Mr. Burton, who, alas! is but too well acquainted with our &s;ad &s;tory, to deliver it; and from whence could he receive it? Where is this unhappy&mdash;this ill-fated man? Perhaps he is in the heavi|ne&s;s of &s;ome deep di&s;tre&s;s, or of a dire &s;ick|ne&s;s. Mr. Burton &s;poke of his having been given over, yet mentioned hopes of doing
<PB N="139" REF="149">well. Prai&s;e be to God, he is not fit&mdash;ah, none of us are fit to die!"</P>
<P>Reflections like the&s;e forced their way to her trembling lips; her &s;treaming eyes were fixed on the direction of the letter; and when her apo&s;trophe ended, True George tapped at her door to gratify him&s;elf with one more look before he retired to re&s;t. She was preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation above de&s;cribed, when he entered her apartment; and, &s;eeing a letter in her hand, &s;tood aloof, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;eem to be obtru&s;ive or impertinent; but without a&s;king the cau&s;e, he tried what|ever affection could &s;ugge&s;t to remove the effect. "And I left you, Mrs. Jane, in &s;uch good &s;pirits, ju&s;t before I an&s;wered the Squire's bell!" cried the poor fellow. "George," &s;aid the afflicted girl, holding the letter near enough for the addre&s;s to be read; "I have received a pacquet from&mdash;but, you &s;ee by whom it was written."</P>
<P>"Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, Mrs. Jane, ye&mdash;yes, I&mdash;I do: from Sir&mdash;Gui&mdash;Gui&s;e&mdash;Stu&mdash;Stuart!" replied George in a &s;tammer; after which, and a &s;top to take breath, he added, rather
<PB N="140" REF="150">more connectedly, "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't now won|der then, Mrs. Jane, that you&mdash;you are in the way I &s;ee you; but don't think, Mrs. Jane, I can bear to &s;ee you cry,&mdash;and what|ever may be in that letter to make tho&s;e tears fall &s;o fa&s;t, don't think any kind words Mr. Partington may have forced you to &s;ay, per&mdash;perhaps again&s;t your will, &s;hall make True George hold you to what you &s;poke in his favour. I have often heard what fir&s;t love is, that it goes to the grave with &s;ome folks, let other folks be never &s;o fal&s;e-hearted, heigho! I think it will go to the grave with me: but indeed,&mdash;indeed, Jane, I had rather &s;ee you happy with any body you liked, than unhappy with any body you don't, a thou&s;and thou&s;and times over, though it were my&s;elf, heigho!&mdash;&s;o you are not to think of what Mr. Partington made you promi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Made me!" repeated the deeply penetra|ted Jane: "no, dear and generous George, the promi&s;e I gave was willing and &s;incere; this hand is yours;&mdash;this heart&mdash;would it were more worthy,&mdash;is every moment more
<PB N="141" REF="151">&s;en&s;ible of your unremitted goodne&s;s to me, or if I have de&s;erved any &s;hare of that good|ne&s;s, it is from having kept you from a hand, which, alas! never, never can be again what it was;&mdash;what,&mdash;for your &s;ake as much as my own,&mdash;I wi&s;h it were!"</P>
<P>George uttered not a word, even though the purified and precious hand thus again given had been at his lips &s;ome moments, but &s;oon after the fair and trembling form of all he loved &s;unk into his arms.</P>
<P>"As to the letter," exclaimed Jane, on recovering, "it was my &s;ettled purpo&s;e not to read it; before you came into the room, Mr. Burton delivered it with every mark of caution; but I gather that the un|happy writer of it has been dangerou&s;ly &s;ick. The letter will doubtle&s;s mention particulars.' Thus, giving it to George, &s;he &s;aid, "I here place it in the be&s;t way to &s;erve the unfortunate writer; my deare&s;t George will look over it with a good and merciful eye: offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to&mdash;to the unhappy&mdash;&s;hould it be within his power, and either impart or &s;uppre&s;s its contents to his Jane, as he
<PB N="142" REF="152">judges it right:&mdash;&s;o good night, deare&s;t George."</P>
<P>Jane Atwood had left the room before George could make any reply, but had &s;he remained longer, it is probable her lover would not have felt him&s;elf either willing or able to &s;peak; the three &s;trong &s;pells which in two little words accompanied his name, "<HI>my deare&s;t</HI> George," had bound him &s;o fa&s;t, that he appeared almo&s;t to be fixed in an entire charm on the &s;pot where it was wrought. But when he could &s;ufficiently attend to mortal things, he opened Sir Gui&s;e Stuart's pacquet and read what follows.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>Con&s;cious of having forfeited every claim to your e&s;teem, to your good wi&s;hes and good faith, even to your belief in the repre&s;entation I have now to mention, to what am I reduced? yet, as the generous and honourable man who undertakes to deliver this, can atte&s;t its truth, I will venture to throw my ca&s;e on your com|pa&s;&s;ion.

</LETTER>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments affected the generous heart of True George, &s;carcely le&s;s power|fully than they would have done that of Jane Atwood; and it was the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the former, to make the latter partaker of them, and that with the be&s;t intentions in the world; to place the pre&s;ent repentant &s;tate of Sir Gui&s;e in the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light to the woman he had wronged. But after revolving the matter on his pillow, he thought it his duty to con&s;ult his coad|jutor, Olivia, on the &s;ubject; and was favoured with an opportunity, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame morning, while Henry Fitzorton took a walk with his children: " 'An it plea&s;e you, my lady," &s;aid he, "tho' there was nothing new under the &s;un in king Solomon's time, I think times are altered, and that a miracle, as they call it in the &s;criptures, is at work at the ble&s;&s;ed minute I am talking to my lady." In proof of this a&s;&s;ertion,
<PB N="145" REF="155">the good George, in his way, gave a hi&s;tory of what attached to the Baronet's epi&s;tle, by way of introduction, and then pre&s;ented the epi&s;tle it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The colour varied in the cheeks of Olivia, &s;everal times, during the peru&s;al, as the emotions of pity, regret, and wonder, were excited in her brea&s;t. "We have been &s;ome time preparing our&s;elves for a change of this happy kind you know," &s;aid he. "Poor man! It is never too late to be good my tru&s;ty friend; but, I think, it may be as well not to &s;hew our friend Jane the letter, for the pre&s;ent: I am going to join my deare&s;t hu&s;band and children, who are &s;trolling, this fine morning, &s;omewhere about the park and gardens; and as I walk along, I will think what &s;tep &s;eems mo&s;t di&s;creet for us to take; and if you will come into my dre&s;&s;ing|room, after dear Jane has left me, we will confer."</P>
<P>"Yes, my lady, I always know when Mrs. Jane is coming, before I &s;ee her pretty face," &s;aid George.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="156">"Indeed!" exclaimed Olivia, "how &s;o?"</P>
<P>"By her &s;tep, my lady. I dare &s;ay your lady&s;hip knows the &s;quire's &s;tep from a thou&s;and."</P>
<P>"Then you are within hearing, are you?"</P>
<P>"Your lady&s;hip knows that my little clo&s;et for whips, and &s;purs, and angling rods, and nets, and other little odd gimcracks, is ju&s;t under the great &s;tair-ca&s;e." "And &s;o," ob&s;erved Olivia &s;miling, "you angled for her heart, and then put the poor thing in your net, did you? That is the way you caught her, is it Mr. George? Well, as I'm &s;ure you will u&s;e your captive kindly, I hope you may be in your gimcrack clo&s;et when &s;he next comes down &s;tairs."</P>
<P>"With God's ble&s;&s;ing, my lady, I hope I &s;hall," &s;aid George, making his bow and exit in high &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Olivia again read the penitentials of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart. An idea &s;truck her as &s;he was putting the pacquet in her pocket which agi|tated
<PB N="147" REF="157">her extremely, and at length &s;uffu&s;ed her &s;weet eyes in tears. She &s;at down on a bench in one of the windings of the &s;hrubbery, to recover her&s;elf, but the idea &s;eemed to gain &s;trength. The &s;ound, however, of well known voices, which would at any time have cheared her drooping heart&mdash;for they were tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, &s;on, and daughter&mdash; &s;oon made her &s;pring up, and run, with all the earne&s;tne&s;s of unaffected conjugal and maternal love, to meet them; Henry per|ceiving her, had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the children to hide: the little ones concealed them&s;elves among&s;t the &s;hrubs, while the father &s;tood behind &s;ome laurels; and ju&s;t as Olivia pa&s;t, Henry ran, from this poetical retreat, into the arms of his wife. Soon after, the little John was di&s;covered through the emblematic leaves of a young &s;ir, and his &s;i&s;ter &s;uffered her&s;elf to be e&s;pied, <Q>Half in a &s;hower of clu&s;t'ring ro&s;es lo&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Olivia's tears became, in a moment, &s;ofter than the dew; yet they were &s;till to be &s;een
<PB N="148" REF="158">on her cheek, Henry was the fir&s;t to ob&s;erve them, for he felt them on his lips. "My dear Olivia has been weeping," &s;aid he, "how is this?" Ere &s;he had time to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, which breathed more melody and &s;oftne&s;s than the plaining notes of aerial mu&s;ic&mdash;an innocent &s;trife between the children, demanded the adju&s;tment of their mother. Little Caroline, who, in her walks, was continually in &s;earch of &s;ome|thing beautiful and &s;ingular in its kind, whether animated or vegetable, and who di&s;covered an early ta&s;te and delicacy in the &s;election, had found what &s;he deemed im|portant, and came running with it in her clo&s;ed hand towards her brother, a&s;king, at every &s;tep, "How much he would give for a &s;ight of what &s;he had found?" "No|thing," an&s;wered John; "I can &s;ee it without paying for it, if I thought it worth while." Caroline defying him, John proceeded to actions, which di&s;covered more of re&s;olution than gallantry. Olivia ob&s;erved "he &s;hould never be rude to young ladies, who were objects of protection, not of a&s;&s;ault."
<PB N="149" REF="159">"Be&s;ides," &s;aid Henry, "it is not pretty to <HI>&s;teal</HI> &s;ecrets, when people <HI>offer</HI> to &s;ell them; but, if they did not, a &s;ecret is a thing &s;acred, and it is mean and wicked to pry into it." Before his father had done &s;peaking, John de&s;i&s;ted; and yielding his point,&mdash;ju&s;t as his uncle, on any &s;tronger occa&s;ion, would have yielded,&mdash;he ran to ki&s;s the pretty hand that held the object of contention. Caroline, hereupon, would vo|luntarily have let him into the &s;ecret, which, in truth,&mdash;was only a captive gra&s;hopper,&mdash; had not Henry repeated his remark, as to the &s;anctity of a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was harmony re&s;tored among&s;t the little ones, than Olivia &s;aid with &s;ome vivacity: "You think then, my Henry, that even brothers and &s;i&s;ters, which are, in a manner, parts of one another, may have their little re&s;erves?"&mdash;"Un|doubtedly," replied Henry, "and, as they grow up, their great ones too; &s;ecrets ought to be inviolable. For my part, I know not how to forgive any body, who would in&s;idiou&s;ly rob me of what I judged
<PB N="150" REF="160">right to conceal."&mdash;"But then, I pre&s;ume," ob&s;erved his wife, tremulou&s;ly, "you do not extend this re&s;ervation to married peo|ple: you would not excu&s;e a man or woman, bound by ties &s;o near and dear, to have an uncommunicated action, or even a thought, of any con&s;equence?"</P>
<P>The emphatic manner in which Olivia &s;poke, proceeded from a certain delicate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in her&s;elf, but made Henry, once more, tremble for his <HI>own</HI> &s;ecret, and he he&s;itated; which his lady interpreting again&s;t her&s;elf, ob&s;erved, &s;he felt his an&s;wer in his &s;ilence. It was, in truth, an idea of this kind which had at fir&s;t brought tears into her eyes, and was now &s;tarting them again. "I confe&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "I have, for &s;ome time, treated my Henry with guilty unkindne&s;s, by &s;hutting up, in my own brea&s;t, a certain tran&s;action he had a right to know, and no other excu&s;e have I to offer, than that, as it did not immediately connect with any thing e&s;&s;ential to his repo&s;e, I thought the di&s;covery of it might be made when it would be more &s;atisfactory to him
<PB N="151" REF="161">Pray, pray, forgive me, my deare&s;t love, and you &s;hall have the knowledge and hi&s;tory of it in&s;tantly," continued &s;he with equal &s;weetne&s;s, and was ju&s;t about to draw the explanatory letter of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart from her pocket.</P>
<P>"I will only excu&s;e you," an&s;wered Henry, much relieved by finding the &s;ecret had &s;o well &s;hifted ground, "by your pro|mi&s;ing to nur&s;e, fondle, guard, and enter|tain it in your own bo&s;om, till you think it is in the &s;tate to give both of us, and all whom it may concern, the mo&s;t plea&s;ure; but I would not hear it now for the world."</P>
<P>"Heigho," &s;ighed and &s;miled Olivia, "well, then, as I do &s;till think it may be better by-and-by, I believe I mu&s;t accept your conditions. But I wi&s;h you had a &s;ecret too, Henry; perhaps you have."</P>
<P>Henry was again embarra&s;&s;ed, but as &s;peedily relea&s;ed, by her innocently &s;aying, with a gaiety that cleared every cloud of apprehen&s;ion, "But if you have not got one, I beg you will provide your&s;elf as &s;oon as you can, and not tell me a word of
<PB N="152" REF="162">it; and then, when it is ju&s;t as you wi&s;h it to be, we will make an exchange."</P>
<P>"A bargain," an&s;wered Henry, "and I &s;eal it with a ki&s;s."</P>
<P>"And the&s;e dear things &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es o the compact," exclaimed Olivia, em|bracing her children.</P>
<P>"Yes, and &s;ign and &s;eal it, in like man|ner," &s;aid Henry, catching them from her arms. Thus the little family party were all good friends, though each kept their &s;ecret. The fir&s;t notice was now given by the dinner bell; and the flowery &s;cenes, where the treaty of pacification had been made, and he articles agreed upon, were left for the ca&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING could have fallen out more favourably than the little dome&s;tic occur|rences, above related, for reconciling the truly delicate Olivia to her benevolent plan, and encouraging her to pur&s;ue it. Under the&s;e cheering circum&s;tances, &s;he turned her thoughts towards the unfortunate Ba|ronet's pre&s;ent &s;ituation, with more energy: and gave, to the 'genial current of her &s;oul,' an uninterrupted cour&s;e. She was, however, unu&s;ually re&s;erved, even though uncommonly happy, during the whole time of dre&s;&s;ing. She gave no an&s;wer to Jane's wi&s;h, to know what &s;he would be plea&s;ed to put on. "Have I been unfortunate enough to offend my deare&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s?" que&s;tioned the gentle attendant. "O! no, I have only been in a &s;ort of day-dream, dear Jane," &s;aid her mi&s;tre&s;s, "in which my mind has been &s;o much employed, that I quite forgot my per&s;on; and yet, though I did not chat as u&s;ual, I don't know that I
<PB N="154" REF="164">ever thought of you more, &s;ince I began to love you; and that is, you know, now many years ago." The grateful Jane bowed her head &s;o lowly, that her cheek reached her lady's hand, which &s;he ventured to pre&s;s to her lips. Olivia then fixed on the ornaments of the day, and her toilette being fini&s;hed, ju&s;t as the preparation bell gave the la&s;t &s;um|mons, "I have &s;omething to &s;ay to our good George," &s;aid Olivia, "do &s;tep and tell him I want to &s;peak with him; po&s;&s;ibly you may find him in his watch-box of guns, traps, angles, and other little odd things, underneath the &s;tairs; I have heard of his being there a little before dinner; but be he where he will, I know I cannot make him hap|pier than to &s;end for him by &s;uch a me&s;&s;enger."</P>
<P>Olivia's orders were &s;milingly given, and &s;milingly obeyed; and when George made his appearance, his lady in the &s;ame flow of good &s;pirits, and good humour, informed him, that after be&s;towing on the &s;ubject, in which they were mutually intere&s;ted, all the attention of which &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he could not but confe&s;s there was a difficulty
<PB N="155" REF="165">in it, that inclined her to believe much good might ari&s;e from calling in a third per&s;on as auxiliary; and the only point to &s;ettle was who this &s;hould be&mdash;to Jane, to Henry, to Parlington, or to the apothecary, &s;he had her objections. "In the imme|diate &s;tage of the affair we &s;tand in need of &s;ome one, my good fellow," &s;aid &s;he, "who, by his di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate wi&s;dom, may in&s;truct us how to proceed in a matter which I take to be of real importance; for I cannot but look upon the letter of this wretched man, as the forerunner of &s;omething extraordinary. Now if it were any way po&s;&s;ible, to prevail on my brother John Fitzorton, to hear any thing which relates to one, again&s;t whom his wrath has been &s;o often ju&s;tly kindled, he is the man in the world to be re&s;orted to on this occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>"An plea&s;e you my lady," &s;aid George, "if it was the devil him&s;elf&mdash;God forgive me for &s;peaking of him before your lady|&s;hip&mdash;Mr. Sir John would &s;ee that the devil had his due, though he defied him and all
<PB N="156" REF="166">his works; and if &s;o be my lady as you think we want a little help in this bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Sir John is your man: only we mu&s;t not &s;ay any thing to Sir Gui&s;e about it, as he would be frightened out of his wits, for he has always been mortally afraid of Mr. Sir John."</P>
<P>Olivia &s;aid &s;he would turn the matter in her mind again, de&s;ired he would continue, meanwhile, his attentions to Sir Gui&s;e, and particularly to a&s;&s;ure him that he might de|pend on the prayers of the good Jane.&mdash; "You know, my friend," &s;aid Olivia, "we may very &s;afely promi&s;e him this, e&s;pecially as I will my&s;elf undertake, at a fit time, to make her acquainted with the &s;entiments of his epi&s;tle."</P>
<P>When Henry took his afternoon wood walk, from which Olivia excu&s;ed her&s;elf, &s;he &s;at down to addre&s;s John Fitzorton in behalf of the man on earth he held mo&s;t in con|tempt. The reader, however, will believe that the cau&s;e could not have fallen into better hands, and that it would not have been po&s;|&s;ible for an advocate to have had greater
<PB N="157" REF="167">power with the heart of the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed. But the heart of John Fitzorton, in a ca&s;e of con&s;cience, was not, as we have already &s;een, to be bia&s;&s;ed by love it&s;elf.</P>
<P>While the fair pleader was ruminating what arguments to employ, the good apothe|cary craved audience, to relate a very pathe|tic &s;cene, of which he had ju&s;t been a &s;pec|tator at the abbey. He informed her, that the thick melancholy which had for &s;ome time &s;ettled on Sir Gui&s;e, had, at length, brought on &s;o utter a de&s;olation of &s;pirits, that much of his day pa&s;&s;ed in tears; and when the&s;e refu&s;ed to flow, an angui&s;h little &s;hort of madne&s;s &s;ucceeded: but on every return to rea&s;on he called out on his children, and the injured Fitzortons, and could he live to re|ceive the pardon of the&s;e in this world, his puni&s;hment even in the next would be made more tolerable, and &s;aid if he could conver&s;e but five minutes with Sir John, he would tell him &s;omething for the good of &s;quire Charles, and mi&s;s Caroline.</P>
<P>"Indeed! then tell our good George to be in readine&s;s to take di&s;patches to the po&s;t-hou&s;e;
<PB N="158" REF="168">and do you Mr. Burton draw up the ca&s;e of your unhappy patient, ju&s;t as you have &s;tated it to me. Let us lo&s;e no time my worthy friend&mdash;in the next room we &s;hall find all writing materials."</P>

<P>SUCH a letter then was written, enclo|&s;ing &s;uch a ca&s;e, as brought John with all &s;peed to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"My dear, dear brother!" &s;aid Henry, who happened to be walking in his park as John rode by, "how kind is this vi&s;it! how unexpected! what a treat will it be to my dear Olivia and our children! you cannot think how your little name&s;ake grows, and more like his uncle every day. Ah! may he prove as worthy! I langui&s;hed to tell you how infinitely &s;en&s;ible I am of your goodne&s;s in your di&s;patches brought me by George, and of my wife's incomparable excellencies, and if I am not even yet as happy as&mdash;I ought to be,&mdash;it is the &s;ad infirmity of my nature, and you mu&s;t not chide. Olivia remains
<PB N="159" REF="169">ble&s;&s;ed, our children are healthy and happy: their father is not wretched. No, he is af|fectionately grateful&mdash;and now his dear John is added to the family groupe&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;will be as it &s;hould be."</P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions were uttered with all the accu&s;tomed ardour of the &s;peaker, while he walked by the &s;ide of John's hor&s;e, cla&s;ping his brother's hand: yet John could perceive, even in Henry's account of happine&s;s, the traces of infelicity, but he knew it was like the touches of an old, and, probably, incurable di&s;order, who&s;e virulence being pa&s;t, nothing but a weakne&s;s remained&mdash;he, therefore, heard Henry's effu&s;ions without adverting to the lets and hindrances which accompanied them; congratulating him on the health of the children.</P>
<P>"And here they are," &s;aid Henry, "coming with their dear mother to give their uncle welcome."</P>
<P>The day was pa&s;t amid&s;t dome&s;tic &s;atisfac|tions, which did not allow John any opportu|nity to confer with Olivia, or pur&s;ue the ob|ject of his journey, but at tea he ob&s;erved
<PB N="160" REF="170">that he &s;hould not make his appearance any more till &s;upper, and that he &s;hould have oc|ca&s;ion for George. Having thus &s;ecured the intermediate hours, he &s;et out as &s;oon as it was du&s;k, attended by George, for the abbey; at the gate of which the good apothecary was ju&s;t remounting his hor&s;e, after having paid his evening vi&s;it to his patient: he expre&s;&s;ed infinite &s;atisfaction at the &s;ight of John Fitz|orton, but &s;aid, Sir Gui&s;e's per&s;onal health went much more rapidly to decline than he expected, and that a nervous kind of terror had, &s;ince the evening, &s;eized his mind, which called for &s;omething compo&s;ing, and for that he was going home.</P>
<P>Though John &s;till di&s;tru&s;ted the Baronet's profe&s;&s;ions, and determined to judge for him|&s;elf, he did not prevent Burton from &s;etting off full &s;peed with every mark of alarm and &s;olicitude. George ob&s;erved that he never &s;aw the doctor look more in a fright.</P>
<P>"Let us go into the abbey," &s;aid John, "I know not the way through the&s;e ruins, and you mu&s;t conduct me."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="171">When they had gained the great hall they were acco&s;ted by the woman who had under|taken the office of cook&mdash;"O! Mr. George," exclaimed &s;he, "this poor quaker man is, I fancy, very bad to night. He moans and takes on mo&s;t piteou&s;ly: I never go within &s;ight of him you know, but he made my old heart ake to hear him ju&s;t now.&mdash; However I believe he is &s;afe for the night, as I heard him go into the room where he &s;leeps a little while ago, and &s;ince that, I thought I heard the curtains draw backwards and for|wards, and for my part I think you had better not di&s;turb him to-night, for he does not often get any re&s;t."&mdash;George, receiving a nod from John Fitzorton, continued his way through the apartments till he came to that of the Baronet.</P>
<P>The door of his bed-chamber was left open, and a voice from the bed was di&s;tinctly heard pronouncing the&s;e words:&mdash;"O! my poor, poor children!&mdash;my murdered wife!&mdash;my injured friends!&mdash;why do I yet live to empoi&s;on the air &s;hut up like the gho&s;t of &s;ome murderer in the man&s;ion where my foul
<PB N="162" REF="172">deeds were committed?&mdash;here am I left to be haunted by my own guilty &s;pirits. Would I had died when the generous John Fitzorton fir&s;t avenged his father.&mdash;To what am I re|duced! but how much more to be envied is the corp&s;e of Sir Armine in the honoured tomb of his ance&s;tors, and his pure &s;oul taking its reward in heaven, than the vile body of Sir Gui&s;e, a burthen to him&s;elf, and a &s;tain to his po&s;terity, &s;tretched on this bed of wretch|edne&s;s, and his guilty mind in terror of the hell it merits."</P>
<P>The &s;elf-accu&s;ing &s;pirit, in which every part of this was uttered, the tone that gave energy to every upbraiding, and the deep groans that &s;ucceeded, chilled the very heart of George True, and even awed the mind of John Fitzorton. "Yes, the&s;e are genuine &mdash;even Sir Gui&s;e Stuart no longer deceives. The&s;e demon&s;trations of awakened con&s;cience are to be relied on. Let us advance."</P>
<P>In trembling &s;ilence George obeyed, and was in an in&s;tant by the &s;ide of the Baro|net's bed begging him to be comforted, and to put his tru&s;t in God, for that we were told
<PB N="163" REF="173">he would pardon the wickede&s;t creature that ever lived they if repented.&mdash;"Impo&s;&s;ible! either that God or man can pardon me," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, &s;tarting up. "But, oh! Mr. George, if tho&s;e whom I have mo&s;t wronged could &s;ee me, at this moment, they might well be &s;atisfied&mdash;even John Fitzorton might relent, and while he triumphed in my woes might almo&s;t pity them."</P>
<P>"He does!" exclaimed John, who had gone to the other &s;ide of the bed, where the curtains were clo&s;e drawn, as if unwilling to &s;urprize the wretched man; "John Fitz|orton does relent and almo&s;t pity."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e heard, and took &s;helter in the arms of George; then turning his head towards the place from whence the voice proceeded, and not perceiving the per&s;on to whom it belonged, "O, God!" exclaimed he, in a fearful kind of whi&s;per, "how con&s;cience delights to torture me. I thought George I heard Sir John Fitzorton &s;peak to me as plain as I ever heard him &s;peak in my life, and in a voice of compa&s;&s;ion;&mdash; alas! it was but my di&s;tempered fancy: how
<PB N="164" REF="174">indeed, &s;hould it be any thing el&s;e? He, of all mankind mo&s;t &s;corns"&mdash;</P>
<P>"And perhaps mo&s;t commi&s;erates you," re&s;umed the voice in yet milder accents.</P>
<P>"Again!" cried the Baronet, "but I &s;uppo&s;e you heard nothing."</P>
<P>"Yes I did, &s;ir; I heard Mr. Sir John him&s;elf, who came on purpo&s;e to &s;ee what could be done for you, having heard your melancholy ca&s;e, he is in the room now, but don't tremble &s;o, for pity's &s;ake."</P>
<P>"In my room!" reiterated Sir Gui&s;e, "yet you would not have the heart to deceive me!"</P>
<P>"He deceives you not," &s;aid John, gently moving the curtain, and &s;hewing him&s;elf. "The hand of the Lord God &s;eems now to be upon you, and that of a feeble mortal is no longer nece&s;&s;ary. It would be pre&s;umptive. Your wi&s;h to &s;ee me was a far greater motive of my vi&s;it in this place, than any wi&s;h to &s;ee you in additional afflic|tion."</P>
<P>"O, &s;ir," an&s;wered the now truly peni|tent Baronet, "if any thing could add to it,
<PB N="165" REF="175">it would be this unmerited goodne&s;s from you. Can you, &s;ir, extend your bounty &s;o far as to tell me, whether my offended chil|dren are alive?"</P>
<P>"They are," replied John.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed be God!" exclaimed the Baro|net, "may I a&s;k, &s;ir&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Farther que&s;tions might at this time fatigue you," interpo&s;ed John: "compo&s;e your&s;elf. Mr. Burton will &s;peedily be here to a&s;&s;i&s;t that endeavour, and if it will &s;eem more ea&s;y to you, George &s;hall remain till he arrives."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e was indeed exhau&s;ted, and could hardly articulate his thanks, but begged George might attend his ma&s;ter home.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall probably repeat my vi&s;it &s;hortly," &s;aid John, nothing &s;ternly: "in the mean time I recommend you to cultivate more and more your acquaintance with the Power, who is all-&s;ufficient to re&s;tore the body and the &s;oul whatever be their condition."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e cla&s;ped his hands together in a &s;upplicatory manner, bowed his head, and kept his eyes fixed alternately on John Fitz|orton
<PB N="166" REF="176">and True George, till tho&s;e ine&s;timable men had left the room.</P>

<P>GEORGE had &s;carcely opened his lips during the whole of the preceding &s;cene, nor did he at all pre&s;ume to break &s;ilence while he went home; as he knew, by the length of his &s;teps and violence of his move|ments, that John was hard at work, and would not brook interruption. By an involuntary impul&s;e, however, he exclaimed, "Poor Sir Gui&s;e! a man had better be an innocent dog, than a chri&s;tian &s;inner, when con&s;cience has once got hold of him."</P>
<P>No remark being returned to this bur&s;t, he had nothing more to do than try to keep pace with his ma&s;ter, who &s;trode on furiou&s;ly, and without the utterance of a word, till ju&s;t as the latter a&s;cended the ca&s;tle &s;teps, he &s;aid, "I &s;hall have no farther occa&s;ion for you to-night; I &s;hall not appear at &s;upper; let me not be expected."</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="177">George obeyed with his u&s;ual taciturnity on the&s;e occa&s;ions. John in his philo&s;ophi|cals, as he u&s;ed to call them, he &s;eldom pre|&s;umed to hazard even an opinion: but, in the poeticals of Henry, he frequently re|lieved him&s;elf from this &s;uppre&s;&s;ion by pour|ing out all that was in his mind.</P>
<P>John Fitzorton was extremely &s;truck with the &s;ituation of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart. He came prejudiced again&s;t his penitence, and pre|pared for his hypocri&s;y: but the con&s;cious &s;truggles, mental horror, and bodily decay, in which he found that unhappy culprit, his &s;elf-execrations, his ince&s;&s;ant callings out on the injured, and more than all, his bearing to &s;ee and looking &s;teadily at any of the ever|dreaded Fitzortons, threw him into a train of reflection which la&s;ted almo&s;t till the dawn of day: even in that chamber, which had been the &s;cene of many a powerful contention with him&s;elf, and of many a virtuous re&s;olve. "What, although," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "I hope my life would never have eaten the bread, nor my head repo&s;ed on the pillow of a foe, whom I had wronged; I can conceive
<PB N="168" REF="178">con&s;cience to be &s;uch a puni&s;her, that when once its &s;courge is applied in earne&s;t, the affair is taken out of the hands of man;&mdash; and the &s;entiment of commi&s;eration, the aggrieved then feels for the aggre&s;&s;or, is a part of the attribute of mercy, which God excites in the brea&s;t to attemper his own divine blow."</P>
<P>John ro&s;e to pur&s;ue his mu&s;ings in the &s;hrubbery, on his return from which, he met Olivia. After a little bound of the heart, and flutter of the &s;pirits, which he always felt at the &s;ight of this amiable woman,&mdash; and receding a &s;tep or two, he ha&s;tily ad|vanced, took her hand, and related every circum&s;tance of his abbey adventure, clo&s;ing the whole with a repetition of the &s;entiments, which had formed his &s;oliloquy; "And which may be con&s;idered, my dear Olivia," &s;aid he, "in &s;ome mea&s;ure as a ju&s;tification of what you have done for the man, who has been the pe&s;t of his own family, and the de&s;poiler of ours."</P>
<P>"O, doubt it not, my noble brother: I feel that we have been acting under an influ|ence
<PB N="169" REF="179">mightier than our own," an&s;wered Olivia. "Do you know, la&s;t night I dreamed, that every weed in our garden turned into a flower; the air and &s;kies were as we may fancy tho&s;e of Paradi&s;e; and, while I was yet gazing at the cele&s;tial and unclouded blue, which &s;pread to the extent of the horizon, methought a &s;udden glory &s;hot immediately over my head, and an angel of light, that took the form of a new born babe, held forth a tablet of precious gems, on which the rays of the glory played, and on which I read the&s;e comfortable words.&mdash;'Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy.'&mdash;Then the cherub, who&s;e face had to my imagina|tion, exactly the &s;hape and lineaments of my Henry's, be&s;towed on me a &s;mile that made him look &s;till more like my hu&s;band, and with one hand pointed to heaven, while the other turned the tablet, I &s;aw, on the rever&s;e, engraven in letters of &s;apphire, under a crown of glory&mdash;'I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud thy &s;ins; return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.'&mdash;So that you may be certain
<PB N="170" REF="180">we are not doing any thing di&s;plea&s;ing to the fountain of mercy, by rai&s;ing up &s;uch as are fallen:&mdash;and if I was not afraid you would laugh at my &s;imple notions, I could almo&s;t believe this vi&s;ion had been &s;ent by our angel parents to imitate their forgivene&s;s. &mdash;But, how hard it is, that our Henry is &s;till &s;hut from his &s;hare of what his boun|teous nature is &s;o fitted to enjoy!&mdash;He &s;aid la&s;t night, he thought that you and he had changed characters,&mdash;that he was philo&s;opher Henry, and you poet John, and mu&s;ed and wandered more than him&s;elf;&mdash;What would I have given to have told him my dream! but I thought it be&s;t to &s;ee you fir&s;t, and take your wi&s;dom on it, for you were always, you know, my oracle."</P>
<P>"In the &s;pirit of which," an&s;wered John, much affected with what had been related, and with the manner of the relater, "I mu&s;t &s;trictly enjoin you to a little more forbear|ance, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>True George came at full &s;peed, with the remains of what breath his &s;peed had left him to &s;ay, "Breakfa&s;t, plea&s;e your honours,
<PB N="171" REF="181">will be ready in a few minutes, and the &s;quire is come down; but, O your honours! there is &s;hocking news brought by Mr. Burton of the poor quakeri&s;h gentleman,&mdash;he has &s;at up with him all night, and I thought he would &s;ometimes have gone raving mad, and he &s;aid, 'his poor &s;oul would be in burning hell very &s;hortly, if his children did not come to for|give him.'&mdash;Hu&s;h&mdash;I &s;ee Mr. Henry at the ca&s;tle door, your honours."</P>
<P>George vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>"O! what a cruel thing it is, none of us can di&s;cover where the&s;e dear wanderers have betaken them&s;elves!" &s;ighed Olivia. "What a con&s;olation mu&s;t it be for children to &s;ee and to forgive a truly penitent parent; and what an encouragement for that parent to per&s;evere in well doing! Ah! &s;urely the Almighty will guide us by &s;ome directing ray to the&s;e worthy creatures: they mu&s;t be under his protecting eye. But, alas! what vain trials have I not made to find them! Yet, as their &s;ub&s;titutes, let us per&s;i&s;t in our good offices to &s;ave this dreadful example of divine ven|geance."</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="182">John declared he felt him&s;elf much di&s;|ordered, and a cup of coffee might do him good. Olivia affectionately took his arm, pre&s;&s;ed it to her &s;ide, and led him in to break|fa&s;t.</P>

<P>AMONGST other plea&s;ant con&s;equences that had happened to the good apothecary, growing out of the &s;plendid &s;ixpence, was, his being promoted to the office of family-apothecary to the Fitzortons, on a hand&s;ome yearly &s;tipend&mdash;al&s;o general medical in&s;pector of Olivia's cottages, at a di&s;tinct &s;alary paid out of that lady's privy-pur&s;e, and a de&s;ire that he would con&s;ider the ca&s;tle as his home at bed or board whenever he was on duty, at, or near Fitzorton. Thus, full half of his time was pa&s;&s;ed with Henry and Olivia, and it was as cu&s;tomary for Burton to be &s;een at nine o'clock in the winter, and eight in the &s;um|mer, as for the clock to &s;trike the hour. Indeed, &s;o good humoured and &s;incere a creature had he proved him&s;elf on many
<PB N="173" REF="183">occa&s;ions, that the ma&s;ter, mi&s;tre&s;s, chil|dren, and dome&s;tics of the man&s;ion, &s;eemed to mi&s;s him more when profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;ine&s;s intervened, than if that clock had been carried from the cupola which enclo&s;ed it. He was, at length, become a nece&s;&s;ary part of the ca&s;tle, and went in at the time of the morning repa&s;t as duly as the repa&s;t it&s;elf. Of late, in their own per&s;ons he had little practi&s;e. The Fitzorton family were in the general enjoyment of good health, and what|ever Henry &s;uffered from occa&s;ional &s;inkings too low, or ri&s;ings too high, was imputed to Nerves,&mdash;one of the mo&s;t convenient maladies that ever bore the blame of the head or heart, and in &s;hort, the be&s;t excu&s;e that ever offered it&s;elf to the phy&s;ician, when he cannot find out the complaint of the patient, and to the patient when he does not wi&s;h his ca&s;e &s;hould be di&s;covered by the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Our apothecary, however, always made mechanically a morning tour of every pul&s;e in the room, watch in hand, and ob&s;erved &s;o plea&s;antly on &s;urrounding objects, or contrived by other relations &s;o to intere&s;t the
<PB N="174" REF="184">family, that he was him&s;elf the principal cau&s;e of the irregularity, of too quick or too &s;low; and the pul&s;ation &s;eldom went on, in the orderly way he declared it ought to do, till he had done talking, laughing, or crying; in which pul&s;e-affecting operations &mdash;he had the art of producing univer&s;al &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>He was in the act of counting the throbs of Henry's animated little time-keeper, when John and Olivia came in.</P>
<P>Little John, in ludicrous imitation, was applying his hand to Caroline's wri&s;t; Olivia was in &s;miles till &s;he came near enough to perceive that her hu&s;band was in tears.</P>
<P>"They have been produced by joy, my Olivia," &s;aid Henry, "Mr. Burton has been giving me &s;uch an account of the gra|titude of your cottagers, who have, it &s;eems, agreed among&s;t them&s;elves, on the day that you next ble&s;s me as a father, to have a f&ecirc;te of their own; all your old women, and my old men are to dance together, even though &s;ome of them &s;hould be carried from their bed to their ball-room, which is to be
<PB N="175" REF="185">at Goody Brab&s;on's, who is to be mi&s;tre&s;s of the ceremonies, and who, I am glad to find, has got quite &s;tout again. I am &s;o plea&s;ed with this generous thought, that I and the children will go, the moment we have breakfa&s;ted, and give our hands to every one of them. I mu&s;t not &s;uffer you to venture, my love, the walk is too long; and as to the coach&mdash;no&mdash;you would be too much affected &mdash;and as for our philo&s;opher&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I cannot attend you this morning, it is true," &s;aid John, "becau&s;e I have other employments; but I de&s;ire you will be|&s;peak Goody Brab&s;on my partner; as I am re&s;olved, for the fir&s;t time in my life, to dance on that occa&s;ion al&s;o. And if the founder of the fe&s;tival &s;hould chance to be of Olivia's &s;ex, I intreat that her name may be Angelica, and if of your's, Raphael.</P>
<P>"O' my con&s;cience, 'tis as I &s;aid," ob|&s;erved Henry, &s;miling on Olivia, who had been bound in happy &s;ilence, "my brother has got into my character. Angelica of Raphael! I prote&s;t, I &s;hould &s;ooner have
<PB N="176" REF="186">expected from my brother John, a recom|mendation for Aminadab or Rebecca."</P>
<P>"Why, you are to know, I have heard a dream lately interpreted; and, I think, tho&s;e names would &s;uit &s;ome of the characters in the vi&s;ion," &s;aid John.</P>
<P>Olivia coloured yet more highly&mdash;the allu&s;ion &s;truck her&mdash;"The names are, however, beautiful," &s;aid &s;he, "and our John makes &s;o few reque&s;ts, that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"If we did not grant them," &s;aid Henry, catching a hand of his brother and wife, ki&s;&s;ing, and then joining them, "we &s;hould be mo&s;t unworthy."</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t was no &s;ooner ended, than Henry and the children &s;et out for the cottages. John then begged to be clo&s;eted a few minutes with the apothecary, after which he returned to Olivia, and told her that Burton's account of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart made it, as he conceived, proper to take &s;trong and immediate &s;teps; of which he would undertake the guidance, if &s;he would promi&s;e to follow, unque&s;tioned, the plan he &s;hould lay down. Olivia promi&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="187">"In the fir&s;t place then, and this is the harde&s;t thing to con&s;ent to, you mu&s;t let me di&s;po&s;e of your hu&s;band at Mr. Partington's; and, as I pre&s;ume, it will be as difficult a point to get Henry from you, as you from Henry, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to go my&s;elf to the Bury, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, that I may make Partington confidential; and then an object will not be wanting, on which to found an invitation to the Bury, &s;o pre&s;&s;ing that Henry &s;hall not know well how to refu&s;e; and, if he did, Partington is not the man to take a denial."</P>
<P>"Heigho!" &s;ighed Olivia, "but I am &s;ure 'tis to &s;ome good end&mdash;el&s;e at &s;uch a time as this&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;perhaps in a <HI>few</HI> months&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You may be able to pre&s;ent us with an infant Angelica or Raphael, lovely as that in your vi&s;ion," &s;aid John, very tenderly. "I own matters run very untowardly ju&s;t now&mdash;I could wi&s;h&mdash;in &s;hort, not to deal in my&s;teries beyond the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving them&mdash;know, that the project I
<PB N="178" REF="188">am engaging in, is to bring this, at length, con&s;cience-&s;mitten father to his children," "His children!" repeated Olivia, "but, in Pity's name, how are they to be found?"</P>
<P>"Be that my endeavour," &s;aid John, "as Burton a&s;&s;ures me it would be at the hazard of life and rea&s;on, to move the parent to the children, we mu&s;t try what can be done, that the children may go to the parent. But as Henry has been &s;o long kept out of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the &s;udden appearance of poor Charles Stuart, and the horrors that now hang over the living ruins of the abbey, might be too much for my brother's tender heart to bear."</P>
<P>John ro&s;e and rang the bell, True George appeared. "My hor&s;es," &s;aid John. George di&s;appeared. "In three days expect my return," &s;aid John to Olivia; "tell Henry I give him leave to think what he likes. He has rambled long enough. 'Tis now my turn to be a rover. Let him have his laugh. For you, Olivia, dear good Olivia, for you I promi&s;e I will rob you of
<PB N="179" REF="189">your beloved Henry but a few days. I &s;hall a&s;k but ten, from the day I &s;teal him from you. If, in that &s;pace, I &s;ucceed not in my efforts, he &s;hall be returned to you; and if I &s;hould bring my points to bear, the wor&s;t that can happen, will be your giving an Angelica or Raphael to the world at Part|ington Bury, in&s;tead of Fitzorton ca&s;tle. What matters it where a cherub is born, my friend?"</P>
<P>George entering rapidly, exclaimed "The hor&s;e, your honour." John bade Olivia adieu, with a voice &s;omewhat ob&s;tructed; for &s;he had been heaping ble&s;&s;ings upon him, and his undertaking; called him by the endear|ing names, truly indeed applied, of "guide, philo&s;opher, and friend," and &s;ealed her wi&s;h, for his health, long life, and long happine&s;s, with a pre&s;&s;ure of the hand, that thrilled every fibre of his &s;truggling heart.</P>

<P>A CONSIDERABLE time has elap&s;ed &s;ince any mention has been made of the fugitive part of the abbey family, and yet we feel that Olivia, or even Henry Fitzorton, cannot, upon principles of general good-will, wi&s;h more to hear of their welfare, than &s;uch of our readers as have hearts to follow the fortunes of per&s;ecuted virtue.</P>
<P>On our bidding them a melancholy adieu, indeed, we prepared &s;uch readers for a long ab&s;ence; but the party was formed of too many oppre&s;&s;ed and intere&s;ting beings, to leave the &s;ympathizing mind ultimately with|out a wi&s;h, that in the cour&s;e of the hi&s;tory they might be heard of again. The hints which were thrown out in the la&s;t chapter, however veiled, cannot have failed to reani|mate that hope: for the reader is aware, that John Fitzorton was not a man to rai&s;e expec|tation without endeavouring to gratify it; nor to &s;port in romantic vi&s;ions, or fold him&s;elf up in my&s;terious enterprize, unle&s;s
<PB N="181" REF="191">for &s;ome important end, alike rational and honourable.</P>
<P>Although Olivia had no &s;u&s;picion that her brother-in-law was in the &s;ecret of the re&s;i|dence of tho&s;e wanderers, which her &s;earch could never find, our readers, who are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more family &s;ecrets even than Olivia, have not a doubt but to him they &s;hall look for intelligence on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In truth, father Arthur's little &s;ociety, from almo&s;t their fir&s;t movements to their final e&s;tabli&s;hment, had been governed by John Fitzorton.</P>
<P>Soon after the departure of the good Charles and Caroline Stuart, from the pol|luted abbey, John met them on the way, when introducing Mrs. Herbert, and the young Johanna, he thus addre&s;&s;ed Caroline: "Youth and age now offer them&s;elves to your notice. They have many years been under my immediate protection. I am now ambitious to place them under yours. The itinerant &s;ituation of a &s;oldier, has often made the tru&s;t difficult to me; but, after
<PB N="182" REF="192">much &s;earch, I have found a plea&s;ant a&s;ylum for them, where it is my wi&s;h Johanna &s;hould pa&s;s another year or two of retreat, under the care of Mrs. Herbert, before &s;he &s;teps into the world. The rece&s;s I have cho&s;en appears formed for an in&s;tructive and virtuous, yet &s;ocial &s;olitude. But it is on too large a &s;cale for two females; and I have been puzzling how to bring the abode and e&s;tabli&s;hment within compa&s;s. The Providence which gave to my protection the&s;e two per&s;ons, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, now &s;eems to direct, in the &s;econd, that I &s;hould transfer part of tho&s;e plea&s;ing cares upon you and yours; becau&s;e, I judge, they may mitigate your own, while they alleviate mine. I had thoughts of placing them, with &s;ome of the deare&s;t parts of my own family, at the ca&s;tle; but tho&s;e ideas, on after reflection, have been aban|doned. What &s;ay you then, my friends, will you receive two more unfortunates into your party, and in a flowery unob&s;erved rece&s;s, make a little world of good beings? Driven, unju&s;tly, by a female fiend, out of one paradi&s;e, will you, my worthy exiles, &s;uffer
<PB N="183" REF="193">female innocents to conduct you to an|other?"</P>
<P>Johanna's un&s;ullied looks, and Mrs. Her|bert's engaging deportment, and the know|ledge of John's recommendation, &s;poke the a&s;&s;ent of Caroline, who embraced both the ladies: Arthur and Denni&s;on &s;miled a wel|come.</P>
<P>"I have but one fear," &s;aid Caroline, pre&s;&s;ing the hands of Johanna, and Mrs. Herbert&mdash;"is it quite fair&mdash;is it not, indeed, cruel for us to carry our &s;orrowing hearts into a re&s;idence your virtue has prepared for the happy? or, even if we were inclined to this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, might not yet more troubled &s;pirits detect our privacy, and again expel us from Ely&s;ium?"</P>
<P>"And if they did," &s;aid Johanna, "we &s;hould not be expelled from one another, and methinks, in this &s;ocial retirement, aided by the coun&s;els of my honoured guardian, &s;o he has now permitted me to call him, we could not be unprotected, or unhappy, in any part of the earth."</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="194">"They are my children from this mo|ment, and for ever," exclaimed Arthur.</P>
<P>"And the ever dear friends of Caroline and Charles," &s;aid the afflicted brother and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"And long may they live as the honoured ladies, of a feeble, but, I hope, faithful, old &s;ervant," ejaculated Denni&s;on.</P>
<P>"And Flore&s;co &s;al be their &s;lave, and &s;al get &s;trong great big man to workey till him is older as Mr. Denni&s;ons," exclaimed the little Indian, leaping as he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"Re&s;pecting mona&s;teries, and remote con|tinental excur&s;ions," re&s;umed John, "curio|&s;ity is more at work in the&s;e than nearer home; and I pledge my&s;elf that the &s;e|que&s;tered &s;pot which I have fixed on though not more than two or three days' travel from hence, &s;hall baffle enquiry, and effectually &s;creen you from every wicked obtru&s;ion &s;o long as may be nece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>John's &s;cheme was adopted, and after ad|ju&s;ting military bu&s;ine&s;s at quarters, he gave &s;ome comfortable fini&s;hings to his benevolent
<PB N="185" REF="195">plan, and returned to father Arthur's party, whom, with an adroitne&s;s peculiar to all his de&s;igns when once &s;ettled, he con|ducted to their new abode in the romantic i&s;land of Guern&s;ey. There having &s;taid, to &s;ee that no accommodations were wanting which his power might &s;upply, he pre&s;&s;ed alternatively the hands of each individual of the groupe, and returned to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In John Fitzorton's rece&s;s then, the abbey party remained, not only during the whole period of Henry and Olivia's continental ex|cur&s;ions, without an idea entering into the mind of either that Charles or Caroline Stuart were under his guardian&s;hip. Al|though, in one of their tours, the travellers had pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t within view of the leafy retreat which concealed them.</P>
<P>Their &s;ocial &s;olitude was eventful to &s;ome of its members. In Johanna's gentlene&s;s and improvements, and in Mrs. Herbert's a&s;&s;i|duous good offices, Caroline found &s;ome balm,&mdash;the balm of friend&s;hip,&mdash;for the deep wounds of her di&s;appointed heart. Charles found yet more. The laws of romance are
<PB N="186" REF="196">&s;o frequently at war, not only in the writer's book, but in the reader's mind, with the laws of nature, that we fear &s;ome will think the cha|racter of this young hero much degenerated, when we ob&s;erve that he found his fate extremely &s;oftened by the &s;ociety of the in|tere&s;ting Johanna. The laws of truth, how|ever, demand the information; and the ob|ject was well calculated to lighten the burthens of the wretched.</P>
<P>The party, indeed, all lived in the mo&s;t perfect immaculacy of minds and manners, each contributing a due &s;hare to the &s;tock of general accommodation; imperceptibly &s;oothed the pa&s;t, reconciled the pre&s;ent, and frowned not on the future. The patriarchal goodne&s;s of Arthur, the approved hone&s;ty of Denni&s;on, the experienced wi&s;dom of Mrs. Herbert, the touching &s;implicity of the little Indian, and the charms of Johanna, with the patronage of John, who paid, by &s;tealth, an an|nual vi&s;it, were all called into action, while Charles and Caroline were happily amu&s;ed by the&s;e their friends, or &s;trengthened, by private communication, the virtue of each other; and
<PB N="187" REF="197">thus the time pa&s;&s;ed on, if not without trou|ble, free from tho&s;e paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair, which would have embittered a &s;tate de&s;titute of &s;uch &s;ocial re&s;ources. And, in order to give permanent tranquillity to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, which John had thus generou&s;ly formed, the hou&s;e was taken in the maiden name of Mrs. Herbert, retiring with her fa|mily, on a plan of oeconomy, &s;o exact, that country vi&s;itings, and the in&s;ipid formalities which connect therewith, were all excluded: and here they might have continued unex|plored, undi&s;turbed, even till their graves formed part of the flowers that bloomed about their re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Nor was the prime contriver, and con|ductor of this &s;ocial &s;eque&s;tration, without &s;ome rich con&s;olements&mdash;Alas! none more wanted con&s;olation! Self-bani&s;hed from the &s;ight of her his &s;oul adored, even while he was perpetually invited to remain where he might both &s;ee and hear the object of that adoration, John Fitzorton had proved that nothing but the mo&s;t vigorous exerci&s;e of a determined mind, forcing it&s;elf into deeds
<PB N="188" REF="198">that mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, divide the thoughts, could prevent an indulgence which would mingle &s;hame with &s;orrow. A combination which he, of all human beings, was the lea&s;t able to endure.&mdash;"All I have for it," &s;aid he, on leaving the ca&s;tle, "whether in peace or war, at home or abroad, is occupation: the mere&s;t trifle whereon this can be formed, is better than that &s;olitary indolence of the &s;oul, or what is yet wor&s;e, that ruinous activity of the pa&s;&s;ions, which with the &s;harpne&s;s of unavoidable misfortune blends the turpitude of voluntary guilt."</P>
<P>Reflections like the&s;e were revolving in his mind, when the departure of the de&s;erving children of a worthle&s;s father, and of an in|famous &s;tep-mother was reported to him. He caught at it as one of the occa&s;ions want|ing to his own virtue, and re&s;olved to make it &s;erviceable. The good literally wanted "a local habitation, and a name." He &s;up|plied them with both. They &s;tood in need of tho&s;e &s;ocial aids which the innocently wretched derive from communion with the worthy. Such communion could John afford:
<PB N="189" REF="199">he could enrich the groupe by two beings whom he knew to de&s;erve father Arthur's a&s;&s;ociation. Many things met together to render this arrangement no le&s;s agreeable to the objects of his protection, than to tho&s;e whom their more recent misfortune had re|commended to him.</P>
<P>The blooming daughter of the ill-fated Maria, and the haple&s;s widow of a no le&s;s ill-fated gentleman, had been long remaining at the village where the faithle&s;s mother of Johanna had been buried; but the frequent vi&s;its of John had been marked by curio&s;ity, and mi&s;repre&s;ented by malice; and a certain my&s;tery in the fortunes, both of Mrs. Her|bert and of Johanna, &s;eemed to give colour to &s;u&s;picion, who not being able to move the cloud, drew upon John &s;ome reflections, and upon the objects of his protection yet more.&mdash;"So far as this trumpery re&s;pects my&s;elf," &s;aid John, "I &s;hould laugh it to &s;corn; but the innocent beings I have beck|oned from the &s;torm, one of whom, alas! I have widowed, mu&s;t be no le&s;s defended in their fame than in their fortunes. The flight
<PB N="190" REF="200">of Caroline is an opportunity not to be &s;lighted. I will endeavour to profit of it &s;o as to &s;erve mutually the protectors and the protected. When I promi&s;ed the helple&s;s Johanna, at the foot of her mother's grave, that &s;he &s;hould not want a parent, it was a promi&s;e to &s;tand beyond the date of my life, and to the extent of hers, and poor Herbert's relict is the death-bed legacy of a murdered friend."</P>

<P>WE feel that it would be cruelty to proceed in the hi&s;tory of the Ab&s;entees with|out accounting to our readers for the expre&s;|&s;ion which clo&s;ed the la&s;t chapter, and for another, yet more &s;trange, in the &s;ame page, viz. that John Fitzorton had been the cau&s;e of widowhood to an innocent being, and that Herbert was the legacy of a murdered friend. John was him&s;elf the murderer&mdash;a charge which we will &s;ettle in the words of Mrs. Herbert, who, one day after much &s;olicita|tion, gratified her &s;eque&s;tered friends with a
<PB N="191" REF="201">&s;ummary account of this fatal circum&s;tance. "It is the only &s;ubject on which I tru&s;t I need be &s;olicited," ob&s;erved the widow, "for wherefore &s;hould I grieve tho&s;e whom I love.</P>
<P>"Colonel Herbert was at once my guard|ian, my lover, and my hu&s;band. He had honour in the profe&s;&s;ional part of his charac|ter, and truth, tenderne&s;s, and worth, in every other; but his nature was precipitate, and who in ha&s;te is prudent? He com|manded a regiment, when John Fitzorton,&mdash; to relieve an unea&s;y mind,&mdash;droop not, my Johanna,&mdash;fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the &s;word; but the mind of Mr. Fitzorton, whether happy, or in di&s;tre&s;s, owned no &s;uperior. My dear Herbert felt the high preten&s;ions of the youth, and admitted him of equal rank in the dignity of &s;en&s;e and virtue. The colo|nel and en&s;ign were, therefore, bo&s;om|friends. The man of forty, and the &s;trip|ling of eighteen, were in&s;eparable com|panions. But once, in an evil hour, my Herbert yielding, on &s;ome trifling occa|&s;ion, to &s;udden anger&mdash;the &s;ole error of his noble nature,&mdash;taxed his young companion
<PB N="192" REF="202">with having mi&s;tated a fact.&mdash;A mi&s;tater of facts, &s;aid the en&s;ign, is a lyar.&mdash;Con|&s;true as you may, boy, &s;aid the colonel, you have mi&s;tated a fact, and if that forms a lyar, you may apply it.&mdash;The man who dares to tell me &s;o, retorted the en&s;ign, &s;hall wa&s;h away the &s;tain either with his blood or with mine.&mdash;In one moment their &s;words were drawn, in the next the blade of the en&s;ign's broke in the tendere&s;t of human hearts; but even as life was flowing from it, a per&s;on who had been expected, came into the room to confirm the truth of what the en&s;ign had a&s;&s;erted. My poor Herbert, &s;en&s;ible of his error, in|&s;tantly made voluntary oath before that per&s;on, of his having provoked the en&s;ign beyond the bearing of an officer or a man,&mdash; I was &s;ent for, but alas! entered the room only to receive the la&s;t farewel.&mdash;Amelia, &s;aid the expiring Herbert, yours is the harde&s;t lot; my friend mu&s;t be acquitted with honour; eternal coward mu&s;t have &s;tuck to his name had he tamely borne my ra&s;h re|proaches;&mdash;but what is to become of my
<PB N="193" REF="203">wife?&mdash;all your own fortune went by your own de&s;ire to relieve part of our families:&mdash; mine was that of a &s;oldier, and depended on my life,&mdash;and yet, I have ra&s;hly lived as if I never were to die. Alas! Amelia, I fear when the hone&s;t claims upon me are &s;ettled, and my body put into a decent grave, you will have rea&s;on to cur&s;e the hour you gave your hand to an improvident man who&s;e pro|fu&s;ion has been as unbounded as his love."&mdash; "Oh! I &s;hall ble&s;s it ever as the happie&s;t and mo&s;t honoured moment of my exi&s;tence, &s;aid I."&mdash;"Wretch that I am!" exclaimed the en&s;ign, "let the cur&s;e be directed to me, who have impoveri&s;hed the wife, and murdered the hu&s;band."&mdash;"Fitzorton," &s;aid the unfortunate Herbert, alternately pre&s;&s;ing my hand and that of the en&s;ign, to his quivering lips.&mdash; "It was unavoidable; befriend my widow."&mdash; The pang that took him out of the world immediately followed. The en&s;ign, dropping on his knees, &s;wore he &s;hould in&s;tantly de|liver him&s;elf up to ju&s;tice, but if acquitted, would make all the mi&s;erable reparation in his power.&mdash;And, O my friends! if it were
<PB N="194" REF="204">permitted me to tell you with what &s;anctity he has kept his oath, and how, in my &s;ickne&s;s, my &s;orrow, my almo&s;t in&s;anity, he has &s;aved my rea&s;on, my life, and laboured the good of my remote&s;t relatives as well as tho&s;e of my hu&s;band,&mdash;and if you could hear even &s;till, how often he bemoans the inevitable wound which inexorable honour impo&s;ed, you would, if it could be po&s;&s;ible, honour him yet more."</P>
<P>"That is not po&s;&s;ible," exclaimed the overwhelmed Johanna.</P>
<P>Every body admitted this, yet every body tenderly pitied Mrs. Herbert. Flore&s;co wi&s;hed he had been killed in&s;tead of the colonel. "Ble&s;&s;ed be my hu&s;band, and ble&s;&s;ed be John Fitzorton!" &s;aid the bereaved Amelia, "God orders, it is ours to obey."</P>
<P>She wept and bowed her head.</P>

<P>JUSTIFIED by the inexorable laws of honour, which <Q>Not the firm philo&s;opher may &s;corn;</Q> acquitted, likewi&s;e, by the laws of the land, the author of Colonel Herbert's death was &s;till found guilty before that tribunal, at which he tried, with almo&s;t unexampled &s;e|verity, every action of his life. "Dire and calamitous event," would he often exclaim, as he &s;urveyed her whom he had widowed; "and yet, if the hu&s;band I have robbed you of, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and lives, I mu&s;t have been condemned to hazard a &s;imilar murder upon each, had the offence been repeated a thou&s;and times. So imperious, alas! are the compacts of &s;ocial men! We may deplore, but dare not violate them,"</P>
<P>Unhappy John! yet the angel which blu&s;hed at the death of Herbert, &s;miled on thy adoption of the orphan Johanna, and of
<PB N="196" REF="206">thy protection of the mourning Amelia: nor &s;hall thy generous &s;olicitude for the honour and happine&s;s of Olivia,&mdash;innocent cau&s;e of many a bitter pang to thee,&mdash;be forgotten, where tho&s;e good works which glorify the father, are trea&s;ured up and had in remem|brance!</P>
<P>In truth, the care of Mrs. Herbert, and of Johanna, of Charles and Caroline Stuart, of Henry and Olivia Fitzorton, and the un|wearied attention he paid to their &s;everal nece&s;&s;ities, were the grand remedies which John made u&s;e of to mitigate the various incurable ills which afflicted his mind. They were not only as the cloudy pillar to conceal, even from him&s;elf, the darkne&s;s of his fate, but the pillar of fire, to give him at once light and &s;trength in the way that he &s;hould go, even as if a heavenly-guide had gone before him.</P>
<P>We are, indeed, firmly per&s;uaded, that, could tho&s;e who are under heavy afflictions, from whatever cau&s;e, but e&s;pecially from a &s;trife of the pa&s;&s;ions, imitate John Fitzorton in their adver&s;ity, they would gain a temporary
<PB N="197" REF="207">refuge from them&s;elves; and the return to their own &s;tate would be &s;oftened by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that the time of their trouble has been a period of comfort to tho&s;e, whom, in the &s;ea&s;on of pro&s;perity, they might have neglected. Thus would their &s;ympathy be repaid by the oblivion which the exerci&s;e of &s;ocial virtue throws over &s;elfi&s;h &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Inflexibly fixed to his point, neither the &s;orrows of Henry, nor even the anxious wi&s;hes of Olivia, to explore the haunts of his fugitives, could prevail with John Fitzorton to &s;hare a &s;ecret, on the &s;anctity of which he believed was founded, not only the repo&s;e of his relatives at the ca&s;tle, but of all the other objects of his care. Indeed, a ca&s;e of the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity only, could have tempted him to draw any of the a&s;&s;ociated company from their peaceful retreat. The one which now pre&s;ented it&s;elf he deemed to be of that kind. The unequivocal contrition of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, was he thought, a grand operation of con&s;cience on the &s;oul of man. He marked it as an important in&s;tance of the power of that wonder-working Providence
<PB N="198" REF="208">which can bring the mo&s;t hardened hypo|crite to repentance, break down all the apparently &s;trong holds of pro&s;perous vice, and convert the very &s;hame and ruin of the guilty to the rai&s;ing up of the innocent; and, dete&s;table as the very name of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart had been to John Fitzorton, even from his boyi&s;h days,&mdash;dupe of his di&s;&s;imulations, as he had him&s;elf been, he now felt for him a &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion, and a wi&s;h to &s;ave his life, for the purpo&s;es of more com|pleat reformation; and to deny his children the hone&s;t joy of becoming in&s;trumental in that good work, he thought would be to withold from them the rights of nature and the rewards of virtue.</P>
<P>While he was on his way to the Bury, he put into train a variety of important mea|&s;ures; as a preliminary to which, he re&s;ted at an inn on the road, and wrote as follows, to True George; <Q>The bearer will conduct you to JOHN FITZORTON.</Q> and while the me&s;&s;enger was gone, he em|ployed

<P>NOTHING material for the reader to know happened to either of the travellers till they had reached the place of their re&s;pective de&s;tination. The interview of Colonel Fitzorton with Partington la&s;ted &s;everal hours; for it was by far the mo&s;t arduous part in the plan of the former to convince the latter that any thing like peni|tence could proceed from the heart of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart. Although John &s;aid, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, that if he was him&s;elf con|vinced in that point, every other per&s;on might be. "Depend upon it, you in&s;uffer|able &s;coundrel," &s;aid the &s;quire to John, "Sir Gui&s;e, is &s;till a mo&s;t honourable gen|tleman, and de&s;erving every attention"&mdash; bowing&mdash;"the gallows can be&s;tow; and you are again deceived by appearances, although you have taken it into your head to imagine that he is a good for nothing
<PB N="202" REF="212">&s;coundrel, who means what he &s;ays." At length, however, the colonel painted the forlorn con|dition of the Baronet &s;o much to the heart of Partington, that he was brought to the cri&s;is of the mo&s;t abu&s;ive impatience, and execrated Le Maitre for not putting &s;ome things into his portmanteau, before the lea&s;t mention had been made of a journey: called the groom and po&s;tillions caitiffs of the fir&s;t order, for not coming round with the hor&s;es and carriage before any direc|tions had been &s;ent to the &s;tables, and helping him&s;elf to prepare what he thought nece&s;&s;ary; he in a manner forced refre&s;h|ments down the throat of the colonel, crouded &s;ome wine and fruit into the chai&s;e, and hurrying in John, he de&s;ired the ra&s;cals would make the mo&s;t ha&s;te they could to Fitzorton ca&s;tle: ordering Le Mai|tre to &s;end a &s;ervant with the colonel's jaded hor&s;e, when he had been as well taken care of as his atrocious ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>On their arrival at the abbey, Partington &s;eized upon Henry, after having expre&s;&s;ed his joy at &s;eeing him by a volley of kind
<PB N="203" REF="213">&s;currilities, and then exclaimed, "You are all promi&s;e-breakers, and caitiffs&mdash;men, wo|men, and children&mdash;none of you having kept your word, &s;ince your return from vagabondi&s;m, to make me a vi&s;it at the Bury. I have given you credit, for this debt, too long already, and now arre&s;t the father and daughter, in my own name, and by virtue of my own &s;upreme authority; and when I think fit to relea&s;e them, will have the other two little villains; &s;o take a &s;hort leave of one another, and to pri&s;on with you."</P>
<P>"Egregious John," &s;aid he, "will &s;ettle the re&s;t; and take heed that we are off by break of day&mdash;a few radi&s;hes, mean while, and to bed.</P>
<P>Henry had, indeed, been long in vi&s;iting arrears with the worthy Partington, for whom he continued to feel the mo&s;t &s;incere re&s;pect: and &s;uppo&s;ing that his friend had taken a journey to the Ca&s;tle purely to fetch him, agreed to become his captive, and to be led to the Bury in the chains of friend|&s;hip; and gained the con&s;ent of his wife, to
<PB N="204" REF="214">&s;uffer little Caroline to be his companion; to which, on &s;ome previous hints from the colonel, &s;he acceded. Partington, who con|ducted every project with all the ferment of his di&s;po&s;ition, hardly &s;uffered the dawn to &s;hew it&s;elf, ere he arou&s;ed his culprits, as he called them, declaring, that "if they had not had their nap out, it might as well be fini&s;hed in a chai&s;e as in a bed, with|out lo&s;s of time or hindrance of bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>While Partington was thus conveying away Henry and his daughter, his wife and &s;on were the a&s;&s;ociates of John; the fir&s;t care of whom was to make Olivia acquainted with part of the hi&s;tory of the Abbey Wan|derers, and with True George's emba&s;&s;y to them in their in&s;ulated rece&s;s. She ap|plauded the part of the plot which had been a&s;&s;igned to Partington; and declared that for the high delight, which, &s;he tru&s;ted in hea|ven, would, in the end, be offered to her Henry, in the &s;ight of his bo&s;om friend, &s;he would forego his dear &s;ociety, though it &s;hould continue for a whole week. "But, alas! there will be no time for preparations,
<PB N="205" REF="215">my dear colonel," &s;aid &s;he, "it is impo&s;|&s;ible that the abbey can &s;o &s;oon be fit to receive the lovely Caroline. Could &s;he not be here? The &s;udden &s;ight of her &s;ick unhappy father, even though endeared to her by returning virtue, will be too &s;evere a trial. Let us then contrive how be&s;t to ren|der the&s;e hard ta&s;ks &s;upportable."</P>
<P>"All that will be taken care of," an&s;wered John.</P>
<P>He now in&s;tructed her in &s;ome other par|ticulars of George's mi&s;&s;ion, and of the &s;ecluded party; &s;till &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;hare he had him&s;elf taken in their happy &s;eque&s;|tration.</P>
<P>Olivia's generous heart, bounded with benevolent expectation; and, under the in|fluence of &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed feelings, &s;he gave way to felicity that even called for the relief of tears.</P>
<P>Recollecting the adventure of Caroline's miniature, her joys were, however, da&s;hed by apprehen&s;ions; and as John was about to leave the room, &s;he caught his hand, and, in a &s;ympathi&s;ing voice, demanded
<PB N="206" REF="216">"whether his intrepid heart was armed to meet, unmoved, its mo&s;t precious object?" for &s;uch, ever &s;ince the di&s;covery of the picture, &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;s Stuart. "Pardon me, my dear good friend," &s;aid &s;he, in yet more con&s;oling accents, "for adverting to a circum&s;tance which my &s;elfi&s;h tran&s;ports had before ab&s;orbed; which I had, indeed, pledged my&s;elf no more to renew. But how can any of us be happy, if there exi&s;ts any circum&s;tance whereby you are made wretched? For although, perhaps, you may nobly labour to conceal the cau&s;e, I, who am, you know, in your heart's &s;ecret&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I perceive," an&s;wered John, "you have &s;ettled matters your own way; and &s;o I here take off the embargo I had laid on this &s;ubject; for whatever I might a&s;&s;ert concern|ing it, would probably be u&s;ele&s;s. Admitting the point alluded to po&s;&s;ible, tho', ob&s;erve, I by no means own it, methinks, were it for the good of an object beloved, I could, at lea&s;t I hope I could, live in the daily, hourly, &s;ight of her, and not di&s;cover&mdash;a&mdash;a &s;enti|ment
<PB N="207" REF="217">&mdash;which might, if known, involve her in unavailing &s;orrow, or interrupt the per|formance of her dome&s;tic duties. The ta&s;k, to be &s;ure, would be difficult&mdash;but&mdash; &s;urely&mdash;"</P>
<P>The broken &s;entences, and disjointed arti|culation which embarra&s;&s;ed John's &s;peech, while the very object of &s;uch a &s;entiment was before his eyes, and the ca&s;e actually his own, was naturally enough con&s;trued by Olivia, together with the relea&s;e from her promi&s;e, into the effort of a noble mind &s;truggling with a &s;trong but inhibited pa&s;&s;ion; and, hereupon, feeling a real pity for the &s;ufferer, &s;he exerted every gentle power, of a &s;incere and tender friend&s;hip, to &s;ooth him. She tried to cheer him with the hope of happier times; and at once applauded and honoured his conduct in the mean while.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;oothings, however, encrea&s;ed John's emotions to a degree, that, after various con|flicts with him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes driven almo&s;t into a declaration that Caroline had never ap|proached his heart, he &s;uffered the idea to
<PB N="208" REF="218">proceed; and had, in a manner, but from the worthie&s;t motive, encouraged it; but on Olivia's proceeding al&s;o in what &s;he thought con&s;olations&mdash;offering to his di&s;appointed feelings, every balm that tender amity could devi&s;e&mdash;he became nearly &s;uffocated with the repre&s;&s;ion of his real &s;en&s;ations; and was, at length, obliged to break away from her generous endearments. While &s;he, on the other hand, con&s;idered his emotions as an|other re&s;i&s;tle&s;s proof of his love for Caroline; and, therefore, looked upon him almo&s;t as great an object of her &s;ympathy, as he really was. And in this mutual contention, it was alike difficult for both to nur&s;e their agitated minds into compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>But in a few hours after, John had turned, to &s;o much advantage, one of his mind-re&s;toring &s;eclu&s;ions, that, as the la&s;t notice for dinner was &s;ounded, Olivia ob&s;erved him from her dre&s;&s;ing-room window walking on the terrace, where he was &s;oon after joined by his little nephew, and name&s;ake, who was not more near than dear to him, and whom he
<PB N="209" REF="219">caught up in his arms, in which, the youth playfully &s;truggling, a &s;ort of loving &s;trife en&s;ued. This &s;oon grew into a pitched battle: for the uncle going by retrograde &s;teps, from the gravel path to the green &s;werd, the nephew con&s;idered him as a retreating foe, and the uncle, giving into the fancy, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be overtaken; but though he put him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence, he contrived to fall on receiving the fir&s;t &s;portive blow. He then acknow|ledged him&s;elf completely vanqui&s;hed, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible delight of the little conqueror.</P>
<P>Olivia beheld this amicable contention, and trifling as it was in it&s;elf, &s;he felt it to be full of importance, as it tended to re&s;tore her noble brother and friend to his wonted tranquillity. Availing her&s;elf of the au&s;pi|cious moment, &s;he ha&s;tily fini&s;hed her dre&s;s, and de&s;cending into the garden joined the combatants, even while John the Great was yet &s;tretched on the ground, and John the Little was proudly &s;tanding over him.</P>
<P>"O fie for &s;hame!" exclaimed Olivia,
<PB N="210" REF="220">"What generous victor ever triumphed over the fallen?"</P>
<P>"And a poor unarmed man too," added the uncle.</P>
<P>The nephew &s;eemed to feel the rebuke, in every fibre of his little frame. He blu&s;hed&mdash;held out both his hands&mdash;endea|voured to rai&s;e the captive&mdash;begging his mother's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and when they had mu|tually &s;ucceeded&mdash;the captive lending his &s;ecret endeavour at the &s;ame time&mdash;the con|queror a&s;&s;ured his mother it was all "make|believe &mdash;but for all that," &s;aid he, "if you had but &s;een how my uncle wanted to get the better of me, and when he found he could not&mdash;how he tried to pull me down after him&mdash;you would have &s;aid, that's right Johnny, now you have him make the be&s;t of him."</P>
<P>"This &s;ally carried the frolic to its due point; John took his nephew's hand and ki&s;&s;ed it, in token of his looking on him as a generous foe; and then expre&s;&s;ed his obli|gation to Olivia, for coming to &s;ee fair play."</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="221">Thus the party formed at dinner a much more agreeable and harmonious trio, than the di&s;cordant notes, which had been heard at breakfa&s;t, &s;eemed to promi&s;e.</P>

<P>RESUMING his benevolent employments for others, John again obliviated him&s;elf. There were various points, in bringing his plan to perfection, yet to be gained. The utmo&s;t circum&s;pection was nece&s;&s;ary, to ap|prize the characters of the drama, he was conducting, what each had to perform; le&s;t a mi&s;under&s;tanding in the parts &s;hould con|fu&s;e the whole. And to this end, a kind of general private rehear&s;al of the piece was requi&s;ite. His &s;agacious and active mind pondered on the&s;e matters, and he prepared, without imprudent delay, to take the execu|tive direction.</P>
<P>The abbey emigrants, meanwhile, yielding obedience to the &s;ummons of John, under the &s;anction of father Arthur, in due time reached their fir&s;t projected pau&s;ing place,
<PB N="212" REF="222">viz. the apartments of colonel Fitzorton, in London, where they were mo&s;t dutifully received by their old &s;ervants, the Irwins; a circum&s;tance which found its way to the hearts of their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. And the reciprocated gratulations on this occa&s;ion, &s;haded, as they were, with many &s;ad re|membrances, is more readily to be felt than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But Caroline's anxiety, re&s;pecting her father, broke through all ob&s;tructions, and &s;he &s;oon began to overwhelm Robert and his wife, and daughter, with interrogatories, from the pre&s;&s;ure of which, guarded as they were by a previous le&s;&s;on of caution, they would have found it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, without di&s;co|very of more than was then mature for com|munication, had not the colonel made his appearance, in time to re-enforce their almo&s;t exhau&s;ted eva&s;ions. For True George had no &s;ooner &s;een them &s;afely e&s;corted to the metropolis, than he &s;et off with the news of their arrival to Fitzorton; and the&s;e tidings being imparted, almo&s;t with equal &s;peed, by John to Olivia, the former ha&s;ted in&s;tantly to
<PB N="213" REF="223">the apothecary in the po&s;&s;ible chance of Sir Gui&s;e being &s;ufficiently recovered to be conveyed to his children; "as there are," &s;aid the Colonel, "numberle&s;s good rea&s;ons why it would be more de&s;irable to have the interview in London than in the country: and, indeed, any where rather than at the abbey or the ca&s;tle: in which hope I have landed my groupe near the metropolis rather than the coa&s;t of Devon&s;hire.</P>
<P>But every ray of &s;uch a hope was extin|gui&s;hed by the account which Burton gave of the Baronet's condition. "Alas!" &s;ighed the good man, "the very fiends might com|mi&s;erate him: his voice &s;eems no longer of u&s;e but to groan, nor his eyes but to weep."</P>
<P>"Your own eyes, your own voice," &s;aid John, "too &s;trongly prove the &s;tate you de|&s;cribe. Ha&s;ten then to him. Give him hope that his children may be found&mdash;but proceed with caution, while I endeavour to forward their interview, which mu&s;t be at the abbey, I find, after all. Heaven will di&s;po&s;e the event."</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="224">"Returning to Olivia," he &s;aid, "I have &s;carcely a moment to bid you farewell.&mdash; Perhaps the life or death of our &s;oul|goaded charge depends on my &s;peedy journey to London, and as &s;peedy return."&mdash;"As for you, my poor fellow," &s;aid he to George, who appeared to the &s;ound of the bell, "if you wi&s;h to &s;ee a &s;inful man, in who&s;e return to virtue you have been in&s;trumental, receive pardon from the children he has wronged be|fore he dies, you mu&s;t enable me to begin my journey by taking care my po&s;t-chai&s;e is at the door in half an hour; but as it may &s;eem hard to hurry you away again &s;o &s;oon, you may let any of the other &s;ervants attend me; or, indeed, I can do very well with the driver, and you can follow when able."</P>
<P>Within the &s;pace limited, however, &s;hort as it was, the a&s;&s;iduous lover of Jane, unwearied in good offices, obeyed his orders in regard to the chai&s;e, and had equipped him&s;elf with a clean &s;hirt and boots to attend it; allowing him&s;elf only time to look in upon his Jane;&mdash; to a&s;&s;ure her he was alive, that he loved her, and that although he was, to be &s;ure,
<PB N="215" REF="225">going out again on Mr. Col. Sir John's bu&s;ine&s;s, he would think of her all the way going and coming, till God willing, he might &s;it down and re&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;pace between the ca&s;tle and place of rendezvous being in a manner barren ground, we &s;hall pa&s;s to the latter, and repre&s;ent, as fatisfactorily ae we are able, the meeting of John Fitzorton, and his friends. It had even more of intere&s;t for his heart than he ex|pected; for Mrs. Herbert and Johanna were of the party. The moment he entered, Johanna was at the feet of her &s;econd father, who&s;e honoured hand &s;he impre&s;&s;ed with many a ki&s;s, and bathed with many a tear.&mdash; Caroline would have followed her example, but that &s;he was prevented by the impetuous emotions of Charles, who in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;haring the embraces of their guardian friend. Father Arthur would have bent that knee, which had hitherto bowed only to God, had not the extravagant wildne&s;s of joy that &s;ud|denly &s;eized Flore&s;co, at beholding the man of whom he had con&s;tantly heard &s;o much, divided his attention; while Mrs. Herbert
<PB N="216" REF="226">te&s;tified her &s;en&s;ations, even as the Colonel manife&s;ted his own, by an eloquent &s;ilence that &s;poke the language of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>"Be not &s;urprized, Sir," &s;aid Caroline, who fir&s;t found a voice, "at &s;eeing almo&s;t the whole family. We were twined together too fondly for &s;eparation. It was with diffi|culty we prevailed on the aged Denni&s;on to remain at the rece&s;s, each a&s;&s;erting an equal right to &s;hew their duty and their love."</P>
<P>"Not equally," &s;aid Johanna ardently, as John rai&s;ed her to his arms&mdash;"not equally! Mine &s;urpa&s;&s;es every other claim."</P>
<P>"Ah! can it exceed that of Charles and his &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Caroline, who are to owe to him a renewed father?&mdash;"O! generous, ge|nerous, friend! where is he?&mdash;what is his pre&s;ent &s;tate?&mdash;forgive, forgive, our impa|tience! &mdash;does he live?&mdash;is there a hope?&mdash; dare we tell our terrified, yet delighted, hearts."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Tell them every thing," an&s;wered the Colonel, "that filial love, corrected by devo|tion &s;hould mo&s;t de&s;ire.&mdash;If your father reco|vers he will live I tru&s;t to virtue; and if he
<PB N="217" REF="227">dies, his penitence, though &s;hort and late, will be carried by the angel of truth to the throne of mercy. I revere your eagerne&s;s, &s;weet maid, too much to check it.&mdash;Our friend George, who&s;e heart is in our concerns, and who I have, therefore, admitted into our confidence, will now follow &s;uch in&s;tructions as he received on the road; and tru&s;ting that you will place your&s;elves, with father Ar|thur's permi&s;&s;ion, under my government, I dare to promi&s;e you &s;hall hear the penitent &s;ighs, and feel the con&s;cious tears of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart ere it be long. Dear and &s;ubtle as has been his hypocri&s;y, the hour of truth is come."</P>
<P>"Follow him, in all things, my children," exclaimed Arthur.</P>
<P>The brother and &s;i&s;ter promi&s;ed the mo&s;t implicit obedience. The Indian, who had &s;ometimes on tiptoe-&s;tep advanced clo&s;e to him to devour up every word, and &s;ome|times retreated at aweful di&s;tance, now ha&s;tily approached, and pa&s;&s;ed his trembling hand along the arm of John as if to &s;ee whether he was indeed mortal.&mdash;Johanna could not re|&s;train her frequent homage.&mdash;Mrs. Herbert
<PB N="218" REF="228">ki&s;&s;ed the hand which had made her a mourn|ing widow&mdash;and True George had vani&s;hed like lightning at the fir&s;t hint of his ma&s;ter, wi&s;hing with all his &s;oul, that in&s;tead of af|fixing harne&s;s to the hor&s;es he could have hung wings.</P>
<P>Previous, however, to their departure the Colonel held a conference with Mrs. Irwin and Patty: "May I depend," &s;aid John, "that Robert has &s;trictly ob&s;erved my direc|tions in regard to what was to be done at the abbey, and how the bu&s;ine&s;s was to be con|ducted? I know he received my orders, but did he under&s;tand them?"&mdash;"I am &s;ure," &s;aid Patty, curt&s;eying, "my dear father will do every thing ju&s;t as your honour ordered him; for tears were in his poor eyes at the thoughts of doing any thing again to &s;erve his good young ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>John returned well plea&s;ed to his a&s;&s;o|ciates &mdash;True George &s;oon came to announce the carriages at the door, and when John had filled them as he thought proper, the journey began.</P>

<P>"HAVE you taught our Johanna," que&s;tioned the Colonel, "among&s;t other good things, Mrs. Herbert, the important duty of placing any thing tru&s;ted in the mo&s;t &s;acred foldings of her heart?&mdash;have you &s;trengthened her mind to reject a confidence while it <HI>can</HI> be refu&s;ed?&mdash;to receive it with regret even when it cannot be with-held?&mdash; to retain it with unbetraying &s;anctity when it has been received?"</P>
<P>As Mrs. Herbert was about to reply, John peru&s;ed the countenance of Johanna, and then continued his di&s;cour&s;e:&mdash;"Although I am not in the habit of reading human hearts through human faces, nor, in truth, of be|lieving eyes or lips either, I will, for once, give credit to the honour that &s;eems to mark the features of this young woman."&mdash;"Your place of repo&s;e," ob&s;erved he, "mu&s;t in the fir&s;t in&s;tance be at the ca&s;tle, from which Henry Fitzorton is ab&s;ent.&mdash;Our Olivia will be prepared to receive you.&mdash;Indeed little
<PB N="220" REF="230">preparation will be nece&s;&s;ary; her heart is the a&s;ylum of ready ho&s;pitality&mdash;be&s;ides ye are not altogether &s;trangers to one another, and her gue&s;ts will be her friends. But &s;hould any of our fellow-travellers, either in the &s;pirit of friend&s;hip or folly, have imparted to you, Johanna, any family &s;ecrets, of which you may imagine the knowledge might too much affect or intere&s;t Olivia, I expect you will give me an in&s;tance of your di&s;cretion by guarding them in your own bo&s;om."</P>
<P>"Does my face &s;till an&s;wer for me, my reverend protector, or mu&s;t I u&s;e, another language?"</P>
<P>"I am &s;atisfied with its reply," &s;aid John: "and though I have never taken any man, or any woman's, affirmation on &s;uch tru&s;t &s;ince"&mdash;Here John &s;topped, &s;ighed, and, with tears in his eyes, left a cha&s;m in his &s;entence&mdash;to be filled by every reader with the name of Johanna's mother.&mdash; "Yes," re&s;umed John, "I am as perfectly &s;atisfied, dear girl, as if you had &s;worn a thou&s;and oaths&mdash;as if I had tried your fidelity by the te&s;t of a thou&s;and years." "Your
<PB N="221" REF="231">charge," continued he, addre&s;&s;ing Mrs. Her|bert, "is grown very lovely&mdash;I am of opinion too, with Charles Stuart, that her beauty re&s;embles that of our Olivia&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly the lieutenant may have mentioned this&mdash;Yes, I perceive he has."</P>
<P>As John threw a &s;crutinizing look on Johanna her re&s;pon&s;ive features gave in an evidence &s;o ro&s;y, that he exclaimed&mdash;"For once I have been a true phy&s;iognomi&s;t.&mdash;Un|le&s;s perfectly convenient, Johanna, to your feel|ings, it will henceforth be perfectly unne|ce&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer by words any que&s;tion I may put to you&mdash;they would be mere re|petitions."</P>
<P>"So the lieutenant has often told her," &s;aid Mrs. Herbert.</P>
<P>"Has he?" que&s;tioned John, "well then no more need be &s;aid about it."</P>
<P>John perceived the crim&s;on accumulate in the cheeks of Johanna, and relieving her by ob&s;erving, that he con&s;idered the lieutenant to be, at lea&s;t, as good a phy&s;iognomi&s;t as him&s;elf, changed the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="232">The re&s;idue of the journey was undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed by further matters, requi&s;ite to its hi&s;tory, till they came to the la&s;t &s;tage at a town about fifteen miles from Fitzorton.&mdash; Here John propo&s;ed a change of companions, taking Charles Stuart in the place of Mrs. Herbert and Johanna, with whom he had before a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf. George was now &s;ent forward with a letter to Olivia, announcing her new gue&s;ts&mdash;and while the hor&s;es were changing at the door a waggon &s;topped, and the company &s;oon a&s;certained the waggoner to be Robert Irwin.</P>
<P>"If you are come from the abbey, tell us," exclaimed Caroline, "how you left my father?"</P>
<P>"In as fair a way, my lady, as he can go."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed be God!"</P>
<P>"Yes, ble&s;&s;ed be God indeed! for none but he could have put him there&mdash;I know that by my&s;elf, my lady."</P>
<P>"Put him where, Robert?"</P>
<P>"Why in a fair way of recovery.&mdash;Yes, mi&s;s, of recovering his &s;oul, and mayhap his body al&s;o: though he does not &s;eem much
<PB N="223" REF="233">to care now what becomes of that, &s;o as it will &s;erve to hold his &s;oul in it till he &s;ees your honours."</P>
<P>"Have you &s;een him then?"</P>
<P>"O yes, ble&s;&s;ed be God for that too! I would not but have &s;een him for all the worth of the abbey. He knew me at &s;ight, took me by the hand, and then a&s;ked my pardon, &s;o then I a&s;ked his, and he &s;aid, I had done his &s;oul good, and I told him, he had done mine full as much; &s;o we thanked one another; and if Mr. Burton had not been in a hurry to get me away with this bit of a letter to the colonel Sir John, I &s;hould have talked longer with his honour."</P>
<P>"You have talked too long," &s;aid the coloned, who had been &s;ome time in fear of Robert's loquacity.</P>
<P>"Thank heaven, the hor&s;es are ready," exclaimed Caroline, handing Johanna and Mrs. Herbert into one of the chai&s;es, and hurrying the re&s;t. Seeing John, however, open the letter, &s;he pau&s;ed while a&s;cending the carriage to ca&s;t an enquiring look on the colonel.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="234">"It is from a friend of Sir Gui&s;e," &s;aid John, in reply to the look, "from, indeed, every body's friend;&mdash;our good apothecary, who writes, that all is as well as can be expected."</P>
<P>The travellers, a good deal relieved, pur|&s;ued their journey.</P>
<P>When the colonel and the lieutenant were &s;hut up together, the former &s;pake as follows. "Your forming one of the party is a &s;ufficient reply to the improper doubts of my letter; yet, the frequent &s;ight of an object, of which our frail nature is in danger, and yet, whom a complicated duty places in our view, is a ta&s;k which your virtue has been &s;pared, my friend. But &s;ome per&s;ons who have endured ab&s;ence with philo&s;ophy, have found every energy melt away on a return to the object which had before enthralled them. If you appre|hend this may be your ca&s;e, as much caution &s;hould be ob&s;erved to prevent an inter|view between you and Olivia, as there has been taken to hinder the meeting of Henry and Caroline: and &s;o environed indeed, is
<PB N="225" REF="235">the path we are all going, that could I have brought your repentant, and perhaps, dying parent, to his children, I would have appointed the interview at the di&s;|tance of the poles, rather than on the &s;pot to which we are ha&s;tening. Let not, however, the nece&s;&s;ity I am under, of thus leading you into temptation, be augmented by your own indi&s;cretion. The abbey is &s;ufficiently &s;eparated from the ca&s;tle to &s;tand betwixt your weakne&s;s and your &s;trength, if any of the former remains: and when your duty is fulfilled at the one, the ho|nours you have thereby acquired may be pre&s;erved untarni&s;hed by returning to your rece&s;s, or to more active &s;cenes, which, in truth, you have but too much and too long neglected. We err as fatally, my friend, from having too proud as too humble an opinion of our virtues: and from too great as too little confidence in our&s;elves."</P>
<P>"If," replied the lieutenant, "I have to boa&s;t of any &s;trength on this occa&s;ion, it is not my own;&mdash;and, did I not fear you would accu&s;e me of incon&s;tance, I could

<P>"By the romantic they may," interpo&s;ed John Fitzorton, "yet tho&s;e who are at all conver&s;ant with the powers of circum&s;tance, of time, and chance, operating on humanity, will pronounce the po&s;&s;ibility at lea&s;t of &s;econd impre&s;&s;ions taking firm root in a &s;teady heart: nay, of their being more cogent than the fir&s;t; and although this may trample on the laws which romance has impo&s;ed on caricature-loving fancy, it is within the boundary of nature."</P>
<P>Charles acknowledged that he felt relieved on a &s;ubject he had not dared to open.</P>
<P>"You &s;hould not only have dared to di&s;|clo&s;e, but have &s;ent both your friends at the ca&s;tle, the earlie&s;t confidential accounts of it, and correct; and did I not enter into the mo|tives of your &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, imputing them to a &s;incere, yet fal&s;e pity for Henry and my&s;elf,
<PB N="227" REF="237">I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert you had u&s;ed us mo&s;t un|kindly: &s;ince to with-hold a good example is to with-hold, often, the means of virtue. And yet, po&s;&s;ibly, it might have been lo&s;t on us: for there is no making human beings reach, or attempt to reach, &s;imilar ends by &s;imilar means. I have endeavoured with uncea&s;ing diligence to wean my affections, and have been elaborating a lover's cares for every thing I &s;aw that de&s;erved attention, from the glow-worm at my feet, to the lark at the extent of my vi&s;ion,&mdash;and to divide my heart among&s;t all the gradations of inter|mediate beings, till I could ab&s;orb the one which had &s;o long annihilated the re&s;t; but finding that all other parts of nature had le&s;s congenial magic for my heart, than the attractive particles that con&s;tituted that one, I could at be&s;t only take care that the feveral objects on whom I employed my&s;elf were the better. And thus, were our &s;epa|rate con&s;e&s;&s;ions made known to the world; both our characters would fade in the page of romance: yet without appealing, my friend, either to writers or readers, let us
<PB N="228" REF="238">do ju&s;tice to our&s;elves. It plea&s;ed heaven to &s;et in the eye of your con&s;tant remark, an object &s;ufficiently beautiful and good to draw you imperceptibly to it&s;elf; and though I have not had the &s;ame advantage, the heaven by which you have been favoured, has &s;o far extended its bounty to me, that if I continue to think more highly, perhaps more ten|derly of Olivia, than of any other woman; it is tenderne&s;s I have directed every way to her honour and happine&s;s; and although I admit this furni&s;hes no in&s;tance of victorious energy, it offers to a heart be&s;et by tempta|tions from which it could not e&s;cape, the only innocent mode of con&s;olation; and, O! forgive me, &s;acred &s;ource of my life, if in this de&s;pairing hour,&mdash;after many a year of unavailing effort,&mdash;forgive me, &s;pirit of my father! if I ob&s;erve, but with fond remem|brance of all thy virtues, that the &s;till ago|nized hearts of thy children, &s;upply to pa|rents a le&s;&s;on of aweful caution!"</P>
<P>"With regard to my&s;elf," ob&s;erved the lieutenant, "all merit is precluded by the very circum&s;tances which have enabled me
<PB N="229" REF="239">to transfer an unfortunate to a happy choice. The &s;teady example of my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who, without affecting to have gained a &s;udden or ea&s;y conque&s;t over her&s;elf, pre|&s;erved a &s;ilence, which, in my pre&s;ence, was &s;eldom broken, even by a &s;igh; her patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troying languors which have, as you mu&s;t have noticed, invaded her frame"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I ob&s;erved it," &s;aid the colonel.</P>
<P>"The care &s;he took to extend an example, not of obdurate philo&s;ophy, nor yet of hypo|critical indifference, but of cha&s;te re&s;igna|tion; her unfeigned regrets and prayers for her father, while &s;he knew him unworthy of the name;&mdash;this, my dear colonel, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance endued me with a patience greater than my own. Thus, from a female, and one of the tendere&s;t of her &s;ex, has a &s;oldier learned to &s;uffer. The &s;weet Johanna, meanwhile, at once kept alive, while &s;he was imperceptibly &s;ubduing an unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion. Nature had given to her features a &s;imilitude, which&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="240">"But," interpo&s;ed John, &s;trongly, "un|le&s;s it &s;hould turn out that you can love Johanna for her&s;elf, independent on all com|pari&s;on, &s;he never mu&s;t be yours: for I mu&s;t not have her &s;econdary in her hu&s;band's eyes, even to Olivia."</P>
<P>"Secondary! ah, &s;he is the fir&s;t and deare&s;t to my &s;oul!"</P>
<P>"Perhaps, however," an&s;wered John, "it may be as well after all, that Mrs. Fitzorton and you &s;hould meet; for let romancers &s;ay what they will, I have &s;een many in&s;tances, and experienced one, where a &s;econd love has effaced, improved, and obliviated the fir&s;t: I have likewi&s;e known both men and women imagine them|&s;elves in love much oftener than they are; and Johanna mu&s;t never conde&s;cend to be|come a &s;ub&s;titute; neither am I yet &s;uf|ficiently acquainted with the particulars of the pa&s;&s;ion to &s;anction it; but I love you both."</P>
<P>The lieutenant bowing gratefully, turned the di&s;cour&s;e by making enquiries as to the &s;tate of his friend Henry's affections, "which
<PB N="231" REF="241">I cannot but hope," &s;aid he, "are as com|pletely transferred to Olivia, as are mine to my deare&s;t Johanna."</P>
<P>"His conduct is meritorious," an&s;wered the colonel, "but it will be be&s;t to keep him from unnece&s;&s;ary trials,&mdash;and therefore, when the fate of your father is determined, which, to deal candidly with you, I think an almo&s;t immediate event: the return of your whole party either to your former rece&s;s or to &s;ome other, mu&s;t by no means be retarded. For you, indeed, Charles, whatever may be the i&s;&s;ue of your wi&s;hes towards an alliance with Johanna, I think a more active &s;cene might be adopted. Alas! my friend, both you and our Henry have been too long idle.&mdash; In that re&s;pect, my plan, under at lea&s;t an equal difficulty, has been better con|trived. I have found or made time for the performance of official duties of very dif|ferent kinds: and though, alas! I performed them often amid&s;t the wailings of hu|manity, and the throbbings of my heart, I determined they &s;hould be done, and
<PB N="232" REF="242">that they &s;hould contribute to my private relief, while they effected, I tru&s;t, &s;ome public good. But Charles Stuart is &s;till a &s;ubaltern, and Henry Fitzorton carries about a mind which by long habit of indulged &s;oftne&s;s is unfitted for exertion, and in&s;tead of being eminent as a divine, and celebrated as a poet, his noble&s;t effu&s;ions, even in his occa&s;ional attempts to pre&s;erve the charac|ter of the latter, &s;ink to a querulous elegy that moans his own di&s;appointments, or dwindles to a &s;onnet that veils in an addre&s;s to Delia, or Cleone, his inextingui&s;hable pa&s;&s;ion for the real, though involuntary object of his heart."</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid the lieutenant, "you had pronounced his conduct merito|rious."</P>
<P>"As a hu&s;band, as a father, he is irre|proachable: but as a man, he has no character at all. It has evaporated in &s;ighs and tears. I too have &s;ighed. I too have wept, but I have not forgotten that I had engaged in public employments."</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="243">"Alas!" an&s;wered Charles, "my Henry is not, by nature, endued with the &s;trength of John."</P>
<P>"And what," replied the colonel, "is John's &s;trength? rather &s;ay, that he has taken a le&s;s perilous mode of nur&s;ing his weakne&s;s. Perhaps, my friend, we are all equally wrong to have felt any weakne&s;s at all: and as pa&s;&s;ion wounded us, rea&s;on &s;hould make us whole. But the be&s;t efforts do not always mea&s;ure to duty,&mdash;rather let us utter a prayer that&mdash;"</P>
<P>The colonel was proceeding in the&s;e reflec|tions, when the po&s;tillion &s;topped the chai&s;e to give notice he was within a mile of the place; and while he was &s;peaking, True George came up to "a&s;&s;ure their honours, that the lady Olivia would be ready to receive all the wor&s;hipful good company."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE gate which the colonel had marked as the fir&s;t point of direction, &s;tood on the &s;ide of the road, which all the party mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s; and ju&s;t as the chai&s;es, con|taining the ladies intended to be the ca&s;tle gue&s;ts, were drawing up to it, the midnight moon pre&s;ented to view not only the ca&s;tle it&s;elf, but a much nearer pro&s;pect of its lovely mi&s;tre&s;s. The fair ho&s;te&s;s, anxious to give to ho&s;pitality its mo&s;t attractive grace, had ventured, through the dews of night, near a quarter of a mile, in complete oblivion of her&s;elf, and attended only by the faithful Jane, to offer the warme&s;t welcome of her bounteous heart.</P>
<P>And difficult would it be to find words &s;uitable to the &s;hort, but intere&s;ting, events which her courte&s;y produced. Every gla&s;s was, in a moment, let down&mdash;every door thrown open&mdash;every carriage was emptied&mdash; and every affectionate and grateful expre&s;&s;ion was given and received. "O that I had
<PB N="235" REF="245">power to tell you," exclaimed Olivia, "how welcome you all&mdash;all are! and how I envy my&s;elf the mi&s;erly joy of receiving you, for the pre&s;ent, alone; my dear hu&s;band being, as doubtle&s;s you have heard, from home; but, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall have him among&s;t us &s;oon, and meet to part no more."</P>
<P>While &s;he uttered this addre&s;s, in a voice that mingled the mu&s;ic of an affectionate heart with every word, &s;he di&s;tributed her care&s;&s;ing hands to each of the party. She &s;aid the kinde&s;t things to Charles. Caroline &s;he embraced many times&mdash;and, although this was her fonde&s;t point of friend&s;hip, neither Johanna, nor Mrs. Herbert, nor the good Monk, nor Flore&s;co, had cau&s;e to be jealous of a preference; and &s;he earne&s;tly de&s;ired that the ca&s;tle might be honoured by all pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t for that night."</P>
<P>"This is again&s;t all rules, all plans, all rea&s;on," &s;aid John, "nay all promi&s;es, and what is wor&s;e, the fair promi&s;e-breaker has made it impo&s;&s;ible to chide, even though &s;he is betraying us."</P>
<P>"Ah! forgive&mdash;forgive me, my dear
<PB N="236" REF="246">brother," &s;aid Olivia, "my emotions are too &s;trong to be contained."</P>
<P>Whatever were the particular and appro|priate &s;en&s;ations of each individual, on this &s;udden rencounter, there was no time for explaining them. John hardly allowed op|portunity for the exchange of general cour|te&s;ies: the meeting and &s;eparating were alike abrupt; and under cover of this hurry in their movements, and the &s;hading of the moon light on their features, the &s;ecrets of every heart were commodiou&s;ly veiled.</P>
<P>A &s;hort conver&s;ation now taking plaec, a little farther in the park, betwixt John and Olivia, the former wreathed the arms of Mrs. Herbert and Johanna, within tho&s;e of Mrs. Fitzorton, and de&s;iring George and Jane to take care of one another, that divi|&s;ion of the party went forward to the ca&s;tle, while John's party returned to their carriage and proceeded to the abbey.</P>
<P>The urbanity of Mrs. Fitzorton, however, was felt and acknowledged; after which a profound &s;ilence prevailed; broken only
<PB N="237" REF="247">by an impatient wi&s;h from Caroline that they had gained the end of their journey.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the colonel's in&s;tructions, the carriages &s;topped at a &s;tyle that led through a coppice, to that grand avenue, already &s;o eventful in this hi&s;tory. And while John was charging the po&s;t-boys to remain till the &s;teward, meaning True George, returned; that di&s;patchful youth came, with almo&s;t winged &s;peed, to inform the colonel he had &s;een the ladies &s;afe into the ca&s;tle. "Remain then with your hor&s;es," &s;aid John to the po&s;tillions, "till this young man, who mu&s;t attend us, gets back to you from the place to which we are going. There is a po&s;&s;ibility we all may return with you; but, whether we do or no, I rely on your being found here till you hear from, or &s;ee us again."</P>
<P>The party now pa&s;&s;ed through the grove, led by John Fitzorton, and followed by True George; and they came into the avenue, at the very &s;pot where Henry fir&s;t betrayed his heart. The abbey clock &s;truck one in the morning, and was almo&s;t immediately an|&s;wered
<PB N="238" REF="248">by that of Fitzorton, and the Chapel hou&s;e.</P>
<P>'As if an angel &s;poke they felt the &s;olemn &s;ound.'</P>
<P>Arriving at the lodge, that divided the park from the back garden, over which, as if to welcome, by a light from heaven, the angel-like train returned, the moon ca&s;t a ray &s;o pure and clear that every object became di&s;tinct. Hereupon, &s;everal &s;ighs broke involuntarily from the party, but in &s;o mingled a &s;ound that it would have been difficult to appropriate them. Arthur, how|ever, as he pa&s;&s;ed the portal, which George held open, exclaimed, "Ble&s;&s;ed be our entrance into that well-known man&s;ion!" "Amen," added the little Flore&s;co, drop|ping on his knee and rai&s;ing his arms. Charles and Caroline were &s;upported, indeed almo&s;t carried, by colonel Fitzorton. The brother's feet faultered at every &s;tep; the &s;i&s;ter's trembling limbs claimed the &s;upport
<PB N="239" REF="249">which even the firm frame of John could ill be&s;tow; but the generous Burton, from his appointed &s;tation in the &s;ummer pavilion, marked by many an indelible record, ha&s;t|ened to their relief. "My patient is not yet dead," exclaimed the worthy man, willing to remove a fear which his preci|pitate appearance might occa&s;ion. "Not yet!" exclaimed Caroline, "then he is dying&mdash;!" and without waiting a reply, &s;he ran towards the hou&s;e with a &s;peed as if proceeding from a renovation of nature. Alas! it was but the exertion of one of tho&s;e moments, in which it is &s;ome|times permitted to the immortal &s;oul, to a&s;&s;ert its independence over the mortal body, and to mount with an energy &s;ublime over every exhau&s;ted power of our common nature. At the foot of the abbey door &s;he was &s;aved from falling, in a manner lifele&s;s, on the edge of the marble &s;teps, only by the little Indian; who&s;e ready humanity outflew that of his companions. "Pray, good dear lady, forgive poor ne|gro
<PB N="240" REF="250">boy, for hims boldne&s;s in touching you with black hand&mdash;but only till white ma&s;&s;ers come up." The generous and timid youth re&s;igned her to the arms of her brother and the colonel, the in&s;tant they arrived. True George &s;oftly opened the abbey door, to follow his ma&s;ter's in&s;tructions, and ran to &s;ummon tho&s;e whom the colonel had appointed to receive the gue&s;ts; and when Caroline recovered, &s;he ob&s;erved, in the per&s;ons of the females who had been bu&s;ied in re&s;toring her, two of the &s;ervants who had conducted them&s;elves mo&s;t to her &s;atisfaction, both before and after the death of her mother.</P>

<P>IN vain, however, did the&s;e faithful ad|herents, and the generous John Fitzorton, who had &s;ought for, and provided them&mdash;in vain did the tender Charles, and the pious Arthur, coun&s;el our Briti&s;h daughter to take a few hours of repo&s;e before &s;he had &s;een her
<PB N="241" REF="251">father. It was not without difficulty the good apothecary could prevail on her to go, and &s;ee whether her vi&s;it might be proper&mdash;"It mu&s;t, it mu&s;t, be proper," cried &s;he, "let us go, my brother, the &s;ight of us mu&s;t calm, may perhaps re&s;tore, him." "It may be even dangerous," ob&s;erved John. "Per|chance fatal," added Mr. Burton, and went forward. Caroline turned even paler than before, and remained in terrified &s;u&s;pence till the return of the apothecary, who brought the comforting tidings, that both him&s;elf and the nur&s;e, were in profound repo&s;e. "O! conduct me to him," exclaimed Caroline, catching the reporter's hand&mdash;"my &s;teps, my very breathing &s;hall not be heard&mdash;for pity's &s;ake let me &s;ee the &s;tate he is in, and I will be &s;atisfied&mdash;indeed I will."</P>
<P>Her appeals were not to be with&s;tood&mdash; with the lightne&s;s of the air it&s;elf &s;he no &s;ooner received permi&s;&s;ion, and under&s;tood where her father was repo&s;ing, than &s;he moved to the chamber, the door of which being half open &s;he reached the foot of the bed unper|ceived.
<PB N="242" REF="252">The day had been &s;ultry, and the curtains were undrawn.</P>
<P>Ye who have ever beheld the parent whom ye left in vigorous health of body, though covered with crimes of the &s;oul, and to whom filial piety has brought you, after &s;harp re|mor&s;e has made that mind its victim, and &s;ickne&s;s has almo&s;t devoured that body, ah! recal the &s;en&s;ation of your hearts at the &s;ight of a father under the&s;e circum&s;tances&mdash;then will you have a ju&s;t image of Caroline on the fir&s;t view of the deeply-changed Sir Gui&s;e Stuart! It is true that &s;he &s;aw him &s;leeping, but &s;he &s;aw the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair entrenched in the untimely furrows of a face, colourle&s;s and &s;hrunk as death it&s;elf&mdash;&s;he ob&s;erved the &s;ymptoms of unquiet re&s;t in the catch of the features, and the &s;tarts of the whole frame; his eyes too, opened and clo&s;ed abruptly: but at length, his countenance &s;ettling more regularly, &s;he went round to the &s;ide of the bed, and bending over his pillow remained in that po&s;ture &s;ome moments.</P>
<P>Fearful of di&s;turbing him, and yet more
<PB N="243" REF="253">afraid of the effects of a &s;urprize &s;hould he awake and perceive her unprepared, &s;he tru&s;ted not the meltings of her pitying heart with a voice, &s;carcely with a &s;igh&mdash;but, after having for &s;ome time hung over him, the tears which &s;urcharged her eyes dropt on his pale cheek, and following each other fa&s;t before &s;he was con&s;cious where they had fallen, &s;he was wiping them gently away, when his eye half unfolded met tho&s;e of his daughter.</P>
<P>"O, God! O, God!" groaned he, "there then is one of them&mdash;but it cannot be &s;he&mdash; no&mdash;tho&s;e lips will never return my cur&s;e."&mdash; "Ah, no, no," exclaimed &s;he, dropping on her knees, and folding her uprai&s;ed hands&mdash; "never, never! &s;he is come to ble&s;s you&mdash; to crave <HI>your</HI> ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;to nur&s;e you into health&mdash;into felicity&mdash;into an a&s;&s;urance of eternal duty&mdash;eternal love!&mdash;eternal hap|pine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"And your &s;on is come with her," an|&s;wered Charles.</P>
<P>John Fitzorton, Father Arthur, and the
<PB N="244" REF="254">little Indian, had &s;tolen, under the guidance of the apothecary, un&s;een into the chamber.</P>
<P>"Yes, we are all come, Sir Gui&s;e, to ble&s;s you," &s;aid the Colonel, "becau&s;e we hope and believe you continue to de&s;erve it!"</P>
<P>"And to intercede with the all-merciful to grant you <HI>his</HI> benediction al&s;o," cried Ar|thur, kneeling at the foot of the bed.</P>
<P>Flore&s;co imitated him in a remote corner of the apartment&mdash;George &s;tanding meanwhile at the door, but wrapt in pure&s;t contem|plation.</P>
<P>The &s;ick man laboured to hold him&s;elf half rai&s;ed, while he &s;tretched forth his hand, and bowed his head to John Fitzorton&mdash;&s;aying eagerly, but feebly&mdash;"This, under God! is your work, &s;ir. I&mdash;I&mdash;I thank you. You are ju&s;t come in time, my children, to &s;ee the death, alas! of a &s;inner, but of a peni|tent."</P>
<P>"Yet of that death the all-merciful is not de&s;irous," &s;aid Arthur.</P>
<P>"And if you will try to compo&s;e your|&s;elf, &s;ir," &s;aid Burton, "your children and
<PB N="245" REF="255">friends, after a weary journey, will re&s;t them|&s;elves al&s;o: and when I a&s;&s;ure both them and you, &s;ir, that this is nece&s;&s;ary to your life and their happine&s;s, all parties will, &s;urely, &s;ubmit to my direction."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, unable to &s;peak from the fulne&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, bowed a&s;&s;ent to whatever &s;hould be thought proper: then laid his head on the pillow, but kept his eyes in a fixed gaze on his children.</P>
<P>On a whi&s;pered promi&s;e from the apothe|cary to be again admitted when her father was refre&s;hed, and to be &s;ummoned if any thing &s;hould happen, Caroline was prevailed on to leave the room with the re&s;t of her friends, and afterwards, being indeed worn down with fatigues both of mind and body, and under&s;tanding the re&s;t were properly ac|commodated, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be con|ducted to her &s;leeping-room by the other female attendant: Arthur went to the good apothecary's, accompanied by his Indian; and the lieutenant, though he had hitherto de|ported him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t decorum, &s;eemed doubtful whether he &s;hould go to the
<PB N="246" REF="256">various claims which attracted him at the ca&s;tle, or li&s;ten only to the &s;ingle duty that fa&s;tened upon him at the abbey. John left him to his own election. "You will &s;ay every thing mo&s;t good, mo&s;t dear, for me, Colonel," &s;ighed he after a &s;hort pau&s;e, "where you are going; I feel that I ought to remain here for the night." "I believe you are right," cried John. "It is already near the day; all, I hope, are at re&s;t in the ca&s;tle; and, to tell you the truth, my friend, my thoughts and feelings have been &s;o long upon the &s;tretch, that I &s;hall be glad of a little &s;leep too: you &s;ee matters have turned out &s;o that it would be a heart-breaking effort to drag your &s;i&s;ter from her father &s;o &s;oon, though we leave him &s;o much better than might be expected. We mu&s;t give up, there|fore, the idea of returning to town with the chai&s;es&mdash;George mu&s;t go round, and di&s;po&s;e them, late as it is, at Fitzorton, but with proper cautions, and, in the cour&s;e of to|morrow, or more correctly &s;peaking, of to|day, let us hope all the good propo&s;ed by my long, and your yet longer, journey, may be
<PB N="247" REF="257">accompli&s;hed: we may then get back to London, without hazard of curio&s;ity carry|ing our adventure, at lea&s;t in a &s;u&s;picious &s;hape, to my brother Henry:&mdash;Lieutenant, farewell."</P>
<P>Charles and the Colonel &s;hook hands, and the latter, with the ever-active George, took their circuitous route to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>George had not uttered a &s;ingle word during the &s;acred interview of the father and children, although he had wept and &s;miled, kneeled down, and leapt up, according as grief, or joy, reverence, or activity, ope|rated on his impre&s;&s;ive nature. Finding him|&s;elf now only with the Colonel, or, perhaps, forgetting a moment that he was &s;o, an excla|mation bur&s;t from him, which induced John to a&s;k him what was the matter? "Why I was thinking, your honour, that if poor Sir Gui&s;e went on every day getting a little better and better all ways, he would be good enough in time for one that he has u&s;ed the wor&s;t, though &s;he is one of the be&s;t, to &s;ee him too, and beg of God to ble&s;s him before he dies, as well as the re&s;t. She'll forgive him I'm

Lord help us, your honour, &s;o little while as we be in this world, and &s;o long in another, that is to &s;ay for everla&s;ting, none but a fool, one would think, would be wicked: and yet, for my part, it &s;eems to me that the more &s;en&s;ible the more &s;inful. Lord help us, &s;aving your honour's pre&s;ence, we are all of us a pack of poor little things."</P>
<P>The Colonel took George's arm and put it within his own, and notwith&s;tanding the timid reluctance of Jane's lover, who would reve|rentially have withdrawn it, John walked in that endearing way till he came to the po&s;til|lions, both of whom were &s;hut up fa&s;t a&s;leep in their chai&s;es, while the hor&s;es &s;ilently fol|lowed their drivers' example as to napping, with their heads nodding, and no&s;es bent al|mo&s;t to the ground, only one of them was cropping twigs from the green hedge near which they had drawn up.</P>
<P>Familiar, however, to every &s;udden &s;um|mons, they were ea&s;ily arou&s;ed&mdash;George had brought, out of pure good nature, both man and bea&s;t &s;ome refre&s;hments from &s;table and
<PB N="249" REF="259">pantry, on his return from e&s;corting the ladies, and whi&s;pering that a &s;econd part of the &s;ame tune now awaited them at the ca&s;tle, they were not only awake but on their hor&s;es in an in&s;tant. The Colonel cro&s;&s;ed the corner of the park on foot, leaving the po&s;t-boys to the di&s;cretion of George, and when he heard from the &s;ervant, who &s;at up for him, that the ladies were but ju&s;t gone to their rooms, he tapt at Olivia's chamber door in pa&s;&s;ing to his own, &s;imply to &s;ay all's well, and went into his apartment.</P>
<P>"We are all vi&s;ible," cried Olivia open|ing her door, and tripping into the gallery that parted off the chambers&mdash;"Do pray tell us how you found poor Sir Gui&s;e," ex|claimed Mrs. Herbert, following Olivia's example&mdash;"And how &s;weet Caroline, our Caroline, dear John, how did &s;he bear the meeting?" continued Mrs. Fitzorton.&mdash;"And how did my honoured patron leave the&mdash;the&mdash;the lieutenant?" &s;ighed Johanna&mdash;"but, perhaps, he is come, that is, perhaps,&mdash;'<HI>All well!</HI>' repeated John from his citadel, and then drew another bolt acro&s;s his door.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="260">"I &s;uppo&s;e you know, ladies, that &s;huts out all further arguments," &s;aid Olivia play|fully: "we &s;hall not get another word from him to-night, though we were to die for it&mdash; &s;o as 'all's well' we mu&s;t be contented."</P>
<P>They wi&s;hed John, cordially, a good night, notwith&s;tanding his neglect of minute gallantry, and, embracing each other, re|turned to their chambers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning greetings, however, atoned for the deficiencies of the farewell negative. The Colonel joined them at early breakfa&s;t, and while they were yet partaking, and conver&s;ing over it, with tho&s;e renewed &s;pirits which temporary death returning to blamele&s;s life generally be&s;tows, &s;everal little agreeable events happened in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The indefatigable apothecary paying his morning devoir, and &s;aid that the tru&s;ty Jonathan, who had been the watch of the night, had with giant &s;trides already given in a favourable report of his patient, that Jerom had relieved guard
<PB N="251" REF="261">at the fourth hour, and that therefore the good fellow thought it be&s;t to take the news to Brixham before he went to re&s;t. "You mu&s;t know, ladies," &s;aid Burton, "Jonathan thought we &s;hould all &s;leep the better after it"&mdash;My Sally overheard this account, for the giant has a marvellous good voice, and though &s;he was yet in bed, &s;he cried out to her &s;i&s;ter,&mdash;who is her bed-fellow:&mdash;Do you hear that, He&s;ter? God ble&s;s the bearer. Yes, &s;o &s;ay I, God ble&s;s Jerom for that, cries He&s;ter, waking.</P>
<P>"Aye, you have been dreaming about my Jerom, I &s;uppo&s;e," an&s;wered Sally, "but the news happens to be brought by my Jonathan." "Well, don't quarrel about it," vollied Jonathan, "there's my pretty la&s;&s;es, cou&s;in Jerom &s;hall bring the next account, and then we &s;hall expect a ki&s;s a-piece and double it." This produced a hearty laugh both above and below &s;tairs. I &s;kipped up and made dear oldi&s;h wife laugh too&mdash;the giant then tucked him in a truckle in the back parlour, where, as I may &s;ay, he and Jerom ride and tie in &s;leep, as they take
<PB N="252" REF="262">turn and turn, as Sir Gui&s;e's nur&s;ery men, as I call them;&mdash;the girls got his me&s;s of milk ready by the time he waked, wife took t'other nap, and here am I come for my cup of comfort, and &s;lice of conver&s;ation. But od&s;o, time will not &s;top a moment, although we are often enough obliged to wait years for him,&mdash;that is, for the merry|time,&mdash;&s;o as your faces have declared the &s;tate of your pul&s;es, my good friends&mdash;</P>
<P>"O yes," interpo&s;ed John, as Burton was going round, "as <HI>all's well,</HI> no more need be &s;aid on the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>The ladies interpreted the arch look to which the <HI>all's well</HI> applied, and laugh'd al|mo&s;t as much as the apothecary's daughters, and the giant: and then Burton, the be&s;t natured of living beings, joined in chorus, without having any other rea&s;on for it than the genuine joy he had in &s;eeing his friends joyful. He then &s;et off to vi&s;it Olivia's cottages in his way to the abbey.</P>
<P>The&s;e diurnal journeys were always per|formed on his medical pad, who, as bri&s;k and bonny as him&s;elf, and perfectly ac|quainted
<PB N="253" REF="263">with the doctor's language, trotted, cantered, or &s;et off full gallop, according to the calls of life and death, or only the gentle indi&s;po&s;itions, or the megrims of a patient. Indeed, it was a &s;ort of a pari&s;h-poney, for all the little boys and girls within ten miles of Brixham had been upon its back, and &s;ometimes two or three of them together; when the good man was vi&s;iting a father or mother, the children of the family, or a little neighbour would have a ride on the doctor's pad, &s;o that the poor little fellow had as much employment, and got no more re&s;t than his ma&s;ter. The urchins would take him from the gate, hedge, door, or manger to which he might be fa&s;tened, and hurry away with him &s;ometimes in the middle of a nap; now and then, it mu&s;t be owned, the young&s;ters would lead him into a clover-field, meadow grounds, or con|duct him even into the garden to graze on the &s;ward of the walks, or gra&s;s-plats: and &s;ometimes they would purloin the oats from the corn-bin, and the hay from the &s;tacks, and &s;o reward him for their pa&s;time; while
<PB N="254" REF="264">a few generou&s;ly took delight to &s;ee him at feed, without mounting his back; and &s;ome|times too the apothecary would receive him at their officious hands, wantonly bedecked with flowers wreathed in his mane, or braided into his tail; Burton accu&s;tomed to their &s;port, and always plea&s;ed with it, would then di&s;tribute &s;ome of the nuts, plumbs, or apples, with which his pockets were u&s;ually &s;urcharged, and then man and bea&s;t would &s;et off to the next on the &s;ick li&s;t, whether in town, hamlet, fine hou&s;e, or humble hut.</P>
<P>Scarce had the apothecary reached his fir&s;t pau&s;ing place, ere a pacquet was de|livered to Mrs. Fitzorton, who with extatick accents, cried out, almo&s;t the moment of receiving it,&mdash;"From my dear, dear Hen|ry!"&mdash; She bowed for permi&s;&s;ion to read, and was opening the letter while &s;he bowed. Her &s;atisfied heart panted to communicate, and John auguring from her happine&s;s, that <HI>all was well</HI> too in that quarter, did not check her. "You know all about Henry,&mdash;only
<PB N="255" REF="265">hear," &s;aid &s;he, proceeding immediately with the contents.</P>

<P>"You are, perhaps, unacquainted with Mr. Partington's humour, and might therefore think him," &s;aid Mrs. Fitzorton, "one of

<P>"The gentleman is a humouri&s;t," cried Mrs. Herbert, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"Surely it is very unnatural," &s;aid Johan|na, "to abu&s;e one's be&s;t friends."</P>
<P>"Perhaps, you would think it more &s;o to hear him lavi&s;h prai&s;e on his wor&s;t ene|mies," ob&s;erved Olivia, "which he does invariably."</P>
<P>"That is more unnatural &s;till," ex|claimed Johanna.</P>
<P>"Not, my little wonderer," &s;aid the colonel, "if you were to &s;ee the look, and hear the voice in which he addre&s;&s;es both."</P>
<P>"Still 'tis unnatural," added Johanna.</P>
<P>"Rather &s;ay it is &s;ingular, for 'tis in nature, I a&s;&s;ure you: we are very apt," remarked Olivia, "to call that unnatural, which never came within our ob&s;ervation.&mdash;O, but here's a little nota-bene for you, Colonel."</P>
<P>Being in the letter to Olivia, John knew it might be read aloud. He therefore heard
<PB N="258" REF="268">what follows.&mdash;'Tell the in&s;ufferable Colo|nel John, to take heed&mdash;&s;at: &s;ap:&mdash;a word to fooli&s;h fellows is enough.'</P>
<P>"O, but if you knew," &s;aid John, warmly, "as we know this &s;currilous being!&mdash;if you knew that he hath in his heart no enmity but for vice, no friend&s;hip but for virtue: that his oaths are a&s;pe|rities on the &s;urface, and &s;eem like &s;mall knots on the bark of the oak, mere idle peeling, but the heart is &s;ound and good to the bottom,&mdash;you would think of, and love him as we do."</P>
<P>"I love him in your report," &s;aid Mrs. Herbert.</P>
<P>"Pray, dear &s;ir," que&s;tioned Johanna, "do you think there is any chance that I &s;hall come in for a &s;hare of his &s;currility?"</P>
<P>"If you go on improving, I think you may hope," an&s;wered John.</P>
<P>"O yes, depend on it," ob&s;erved Mrs. Fitzorton, "you will be one of his mo&s;t abominable little caitiffs."</P>
<P>This &s;ort of chat went on for &s;ome time, and tho&s;e who &s;u&s;tained it were thereby more
<PB N="259" REF="269">familiarized and endeared to each other. It was then propo&s;ed that while Olivia with|drew to write to Henry, Little John and Jane Atwood &s;hould &s;hew the park and gardens to her amiable gue&s;ts; the colonel having &s;ignified his intention to ride to the abbey, after he had &s;ettled &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with his privy coun&s;ellor True George.</P>

<DIV2 N="32" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning &s;o generally chearful in the Ca&s;tle, took a different colour at the Abbey: the pa&s;&s;ing hours there had reflected many hues. It was there, indeed, as an April morn, in which a &s;udden but &s;oft &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cloudings, and &s;un-beams&mdash;of light &s;howers, with now a dark &s;hadow, and now a vivid ray, alternately cleared and ob&s;cured the face of things.</P>
<P>Bright, however, was the beam that, at early dawn, vi&s;ited the chamber of Caroline Stuart; for it was u&s;hered in by tidings that her father had pa&s;&s;ed a better night than any he had enjoyed for many weeks:
<PB N="260" REF="270">and that he was &s;till in the arms of &s;leep, guarded by Jerom, the nur&s;e, and one of the female attendants.</P>
<P>Cheared by this intelligence, and not a little renovated by the &s;lumbers into which &s;he had her&s;elf fallen at intervals, &s;he was at lei&s;ure to attend to &s;ome of the other circum&s;tances that accompanied this &s;trange rever&s;e of fortune. Some of the&s;e, indeed, were immediately under her eye: &s;he found her&s;elf once more in the chamber where &s;he her&s;elf fir&s;t opened her eyes, and where her deare&s;t mother's were clo&s;ed for ever. Her brother had reported to her, long &s;ince, that the Abbey was in ruins; that its blooms were all de&s;troyed, and that whatever it contained had been, even like the wreck of an in&s;olvent, variou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed; yet &s;he had been repo&s;ing on, probably, the &s;ame bed, certainly &s;urrounded by the &s;ame fur|niture, even to the &s;lighte&s;t ornaments, which had graced it in her own natal, and in her poor parent's mortal hour. The very portraits of her grandfather, and of her mother lady Matilda, then a child, deco|rated
<PB N="261" REF="271">as before, the chimney-piece. "If the rumour," &s;aid &s;he, "of the &s;ale was not fal&s;e, it mu&s;t &s;urely be magic&mdash;unle&s;s&mdash;perhaps"&mdash;</P>
<P>She hurried from a very tender idea, not at lea&s;t to be encouraged, by going to the window; but from thence a continuation of &s;imilar objects &s;truck her eye, and penetrated her heart. The chamber which both the mother and daughter had alternately occu|pied and re&s;igned, was immediately over the flower garden. This, on her throwing up the &s;a&s;hes, welcomed her return with every fragrance, and regaled her with every florid bloom of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>"How is all this po&s;&s;ible?" &s;ighed &s;he, "I certainly wake&mdash;I certainly &s;peak&mdash;I move&mdash;" One of her women, whom &s;he had enjoined to bring reports from her father's room, entered as &s;he uttered this. Caroline had half begun a que&s;tion, which &s;he broke off by ob&s;erving, "it was of no immediate con&s;equence&mdash;another time, per|haps, &s;he might trouble her with it&mdash;and reque&s;ted to be left a little."</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="272">As her filial terrors began more to &s;ub&s;ide, clo&s;er and acuter recollections thronged to her memory. By a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force, and natural approximation, as well as celerity, her thoughts travelled from the abbey to the ca&s;tle, and back again as fa&s;t.</P>
<P>By nature and by habit firm, &s;elf-denying, and &s;teady to her principles, &s;he had forborn to mention the names, either of Olivia or Henry, to her brother, even though from his new attachment he might po&s;&s;ibly have heard them unmoved. But aware that human &s;trength is baby weakne&s;s, if it inflates us with a daring confidence, or braves tempta|tion, &s;he had avoided every thought, as much as po&s;&s;ible, that led to Henry Fitzorton.</P>
<P>Incapable, however, of change, &s;he could not, like her brother, transfer her feelings, or compromi&s;e with her heart. She retained her &s;entiments of preference, without pro|po&s;ing, thereby, any idea, but that of carry|ing to the grave an original impre&s;&s;ion, unmixt with any image, external or interior, that &s;hould deba&s;e or &s;ully it; to live in a
<PB N="263" REF="273">&s;tate of &s;inglehood and &s;eparation, far from an object who was &s;olemnly and for ever di&s;|po&s;ed of; wi&s;hing both him and the &s;acred being, to whom he was bound, all human good in this world, and all bli&s;s in the next. This comprized the whole plan of her exi&s;tence; if we add only her unwearied prayers for an alteration in the former pur|&s;uits, and con&s;equent practi&s;e, of her father, and her attentive affection to her brother's heart, which, when &s;he found it capable of a change, &s;he conducted by the mo&s;t gentle and generous means, to that of Johanna.</P>
<P>In the performance of the&s;e &s;everal duties, and in ob&s;ervance of the laws &s;he had her|&s;elf in&s;tituted, for the government of her own heart, the rece&s;s in which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t few years, became, &s;he thought, the mo&s;t proper &s;he could have found. So entirely &s;uited, indeed, to her feeling was it, that, &s;weetened by friend&s;hip, and &s;oftened by &s;ympathy, &s;he ardently de&s;ired to remain there, to the remote&s;t period of her days.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="274">Summoned, however, at length, by a voice which &s;he would have followed, though it &s;hould lead from an earthly paradi&s;e to the gloom of a dungeon, the voice even of nature&mdash;breathed from a repentant father&mdash;&s;he had again to approach &s;cenes and objects, over which it had been the &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s of her &s;oul to draw an oblivious veil. She had long &s;een them in retro&s;pect&mdash;every day added to their di&s;|tance. The piety of Arthur, who pointed to higher pro&s;pects&mdash;the re&s;ignation of his &s;able attendant, who caught from his ma&s;|ter's precepts the virtue of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, even to the eternal lo&s;s of her he had left in the Indian world&mdash;and the purity of her own mind, had all a &s;hare in quieting her &s;pirit, and in directing her ideas. But every thing was &s;uddenly and unavoidably brought back. Inanimate and living objects, each intere&s;ting to her heart, encompa&s;&s;ed her about; and John Fitzorton, relying on the force of her character, had not even made the conque&s;t of her former attachment to
<PB N="265" REF="275">his brother Henry a que&s;tion: &s;o that many things, which &s;he could not but &s;ee&mdash;which &s;he could not but feel, were wrapt in clouds of my&s;tery.</P>
<P>Several points, however, were palpable, and to the&s;e her mind, always &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, turned for relief as often as &s;he could draw it from more unea&s;y and perplexing reflec|tions. She again beheld the &s;un gilding the &s;cenes of her youth. She was re&s;tored to her father. Her brother's indignant feelings for him were changed to duteous pity. She had again received the care&s;&s;es of Olivia. A little cho&s;en band from her former hou&s;e|hold &s;miled on her commands, and John Fitzorton, whom &s;he had once &s;uppo&s;ed the greate&s;t foe of her hou&s;e, alas! with but too much cau&s;e, had approved him&s;elf its noble&s;t friend.</P>
<P>Yet even to John Fitzorton, her heart a&s;&s;igned not the honours of pre&s;erving to her the &s;acred reliques, by which &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;urrounded. "Ah!" &s;ighed &s;he, with a &s;oftne&s;s that thrilled her frame, "if the&s;e well-remembered objects have ever
<PB N="266" REF="276">been di&s;lodged&mdash;by whom were they re|placed? My brother, Denni&s;on, Arthur, and our Indian, were far remote&mdash;yet who even knew the particulars, or the appropriate places of all I now &s;ee in this con&s;ecrated apartment? The inventory can have been taken by no carele&s;s hand. Yes, &s;acred image of thy bli&s;sful years!" continued &s;he, lifting up her eyes to the portrait of her mother, "Thou, the prime ornament of all about me&mdash;thou did'&s;t not regain thy &s;tation here by means of one who was a &s;tranger to thy virtues, or to their eternal impre&s;&s;ion on thy children:&mdash;doubtle&s;s, my mother, &s;ome friend to us both it was&mdash;and&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be his name&mdash;for ever."</P>
<P>Turning from contemplations which had been forced upon her, &s;he opened her door and pa&s;&s;ed into &s;everal of the other apart|ments. The naked walls, the half rotted ca&s;ements, &s;haking from their frames&mdash;the damps that had lodged in the ceiling, and chilled the floors&mdash;the dark&s;ome look of mo&s;t of the clo&s;ed windows, acro&s;s which the bars had ru&s;ted&mdash;and the du&s;t which the
<PB N="267" REF="277">winds had beat up, and the fro&s;t hardened upon the &s;a&s;hes which had been left unfa&s;tened&mdash;with the woof of the &s;pider, on which hung ob&s;cenely many a victim, the wily artificer &s;till lying perdue in the centre of his &s;nares:&mdash;the&s;e were all but &s;o many confirmations of her former opinion, with re&s;pect to the care which had been taken of her apartment.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant the lieutenant appeared at the bottom of a &s;tairca&s;e that led to another divi&s;ion of the chambers on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the abbey. Caroline ran to him, ex|pre&s;&s;ing a hope that he was comfortably lodged? "Well lodged, my &s;i&s;ter? yes, in truth, too well for a &s;oldier. But the furniture mu&s;t be from the ca&s;tle; nay, part of it, I think, from colonel Fitzorton's chambers. I'll &s;wear to &s;ome of the articles. How did you find your own?" "Too well furni&s;hed, likewi&s;e, con&s;idering all things," &s;aid Caroline, "but not&mdash;from&mdash; from the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Caroline's he&s;itation incited the lieutenant's curio&s;ity; and, without any more que&s;tions,
<PB N="268" REF="278">he followed his &s;i&s;ter back to her own apartment. No &s;ooner had Charles ca&s;t his eyes around the room, than he exclaimed, "O this can be done only by Henry! I &s;ee him in every circum&s;tance."</P>
<P>In a moment he felt Caroline's hand trem|ble within his own, and a cold palene&s;s came over her face, like that of death&mdash;yet expelled as &s;uddenly by a burning blu&s;h. "Pardon, ah pardon, my cruel ra&s;hne&s;s," cried Charles, "but I thought&mdash;" She pre&s;&s;ed his hand kindly, and, elaborating a &s;mile, hoped he would attend her to Sir Gui&s;e. He obeyed in &s;ilence; yet her agitation both di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed him.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t explain this. Altho' it had been a &s;ettled point with Caroline, never to a&s;&s;i&s;t in reviving the image of Olivia, by men|tion of her name before Charles, even after &s;he had rea&s;on to believe his affections had taken another bent; he had been equally circum&s;pect, only while he felt an equal con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the mighty powers that a&s;&s;ociate with the name of a beloved object. When his gliding heart had once deviated from the
<PB N="269" REF="279">point at which, as is common to all lovers, he thought it would fix for ever, he not only &s;poke of Henry and Olivia, with le&s;s and le&s;s irre&s;olution, but even called Johanna his &s;econd Olivia, either from her real or fancied re&s;emblance to that lady; and as Caroline had never te&s;tified, or at lea&s;t as he had never noticed, any confu&s;ion &s;imilar to what he now ob&s;erved; he pre&s;umed there lay no more danger in the name of Henry, than he him&s;elf found in that of Olivia: &s;o prone are we to judge the &s;eelings of others by our own. Alas, the lieutenant wholly forgot the different conformation of human minds. The young, the delicate, the intere&s;ting Johanna, had taught him, indeed, to forget every thing &s;ave her&s;elf; but had he con&s;ulted the great painter of minds, he would have known, that altho' he had adopted the advice of the merry|hearted Mercutio, by taking 'a new infec|tion to his mind,' by the force of which 'the poi&s;on of the old had died,' his le&s;s mutable &s;i&s;ter, who, though &s;he gave her &s;orrows no voice, nor, at a di&s;tance from
<PB N="270" REF="280">their &s;ource, &s;carce knew her&s;elf how deep|ly that &s;ource was &s;eated;&mdash;might, in a nearer advance to objects long un&s;een&mdash;and &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;hunned&mdash;and at &s;uch a cri&s;is of her &s;oftened thoughts&mdash;feel as if the name of Henry</P>
<P>'Shot from the deadly level of a gun Had murdered her.'</P>
<P>"Finding her agitation increa&s;e, as &s;he walked along, &s;he begged the lieutenant would leave her a few moments to her&s;elf; but catching his hand eagerly, before &s;he &s;uffered him to depart, &s;he exclaimed, "O! let me not be mi&s;taken&mdash;It is the remembrance of a generous and di&s;intere&s;ted heart&mdash;it is the unexpected &s;ight of its bounty, its pity, and its goodne&s;s: it is a combination in which are tho&s;e &s;acred per&s;ons who are above and under the earth; and no object, no image, le&s;s hallowed than the&s;e has over whelmed your Caroline."</P>
<P>The lieutenant embraced her, and being now in an ante-chamber that joined her father's room, he &s;aid he would prepare Sir Gui&s;e to receive her.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="281">She did not, however, remain long after him. He who calms the raging of the &s;ea, can rai&s;e the innocent flower which the &s;torm has beaten down. With him &s;he communed; to him &s;he bent the knee, and offered up the prayer which was accepted.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e tranquillized, and hearing her&s;elf called by a voice which, even when it &s;um|moned har&s;hly, &s;he had never di&s;obeyed; &s;he &s;oon a&s;&s;i&s;ted the pious offices of a recon|ciled &s;on by blending with them tho&s;e of an exemplary daughter.</P>
<P>And now for &s;ome hours they had both the ineffable delight of te&s;tifying the ble&s;&s;ed effects of a contrite &s;pirit. The rock was &s;oftened, and the tears which gu&s;hed from thence, as from a pure &s;ource, were as living waters to clean&s;e the polluted &s;oul. Sir Gui&s;e avowed his crimes, owned his &s;orrow, and his regret&mdash;confe&s;&s;ed that he had erred beyond what the blamele&s;s minds of his children could image of wrong, but that now they were re&s;tored to him he had &s;ome a&s;&s;urance their innocent mediation would be accepted. Avowals like the&s;e he had made
<PB N="272" REF="282">before, and with fraudulent de&s;ign, but the reign of hypocri&s;y was pa&s;t, and con&s;cience had at la&s;t a&s;cended her rightful throne.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>CHEARED by the&s;e appearances, and anxious to improve them, the good brother and &s;i&s;ter &s;at on each &s;ide of their father's bed, and tried every thing mo&s;t likely to continue the happy &s;ymptoms. In an&s;wer to &s;ome kind que&s;tions Sir Gui&s;e had a&s;ked, re|&s;pecting the worthy old Denni&s;on, whom he con&s;idered as among&s;t the fir&s;t on the long li&s;t of tho&s;e he had injured, Caroline pro|duced a letter with which the veteran &s;teward had charged her at parting, and which &s;he promi&s;ed to bring forward when it might mo&s;t gratify the &s;ervant and the ma&s;ter. And this appeared to her the moment that it would &s;et forth, in the &s;implicity of nature, the unaffected good wi&s;hes, and good will of an hone&s;t heart. Of this Caroline, from a long knowledge of the writer, was perfectly a&s;|&s;ured &mdash;but fearing that, in the unfolding the&s;e, there might be &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which a
<PB N="273" REF="283">mind, &s;ore from the wounds it had inflicted on it&s;elf, would feel too pointedly&mdash;&s;he pro|po&s;ed to &s;pare her father the trouble of peru|&s;ing it by con&s;igning it to her brother's read|ing, ob&s;erving, that he might, at &s;ome future early opportunity, either report the &s;ub&s;tance or give the whole. Jerom and Jonathan, who had been keeping watch over the Baro|net, offered to withdraw, but Sir Gui&s;e, with &s;ome energy, &s;aid&mdash;"as his improper beha|viour to that much-wronged old man, and to every other per&s;on, had been public, &s;o &s;hould be his confe&s;&s;ions, his &s;hame, and repentance." "I know," continued he, "my dear child's generous motive, but I mu&s;t entreat to have the letter immediately, and will try to read it my&s;elf. For this pur|po&s;e Sir Gui&s;e rai&s;ed him&s;elf in the bed, and made many ineffectual efforts; but he had taken too wide a mea&s;ure of his corporeal powers, or rather he had mi&s;taken a momen|tary &s;upply of &s;pirits, from &s;everal chearing circum&s;tances, for bodily &s;trength; and unable even to bear the po&s;ture nece&s;&s;ary to trace the characters of the letter, he was con&s;trained
<PB N="274" REF="284">to lie down, and intreat his &s;on to read it; as his de&s;ire to know the contents remained, and was, perhaps, increa&s;ed by the difficulty of procuring them. The lieutenant having broken the &s;eal, and unfolded the paper, began to read, but &s;topt in the middle of the fir&s;t &s;entence. In vain did his father im|portune him to proceed. Caroline gue&s;&s;ing, indeed perceiving, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e, from what &s;he had already heard, now regretted &s;he had mentioned the letter till Sir Gui&s;e had gained a little more &s;trength. He agreed to this, and, feeling him&s;elf ex|hau&s;ted, &s;aid he wi&s;hed to be alone.</P>
<P>The lieutenant and Caroline obeyed, and when they were gone Sir Gui&s;e made another ineffectual trial. "I &s;ee you are main willing, your honour, to hear what daddy Denni&s;on &s;ays," cried Jonathan, who had returned into the chamber with Jerom&mdash;"and I," ex|claimed the latter, "will read it, were it as cramp and crooked as our own." "Aye we'll make him out I warrant," an&s;wered Jerom, "an if it be long, why we can ride and tie you know, cou&s;in. You a bit and I a bit." "Od's zookers, now you are got on the
<PB N="275" REF="285">right &s;ide the po&s;t, your honour &s;han't be on the fidgets for the value of reading a letter; and &s;o as the &s;quire and young lady &s;eem &s;hilly-&s;hally about it, what little book larning we have is at your &s;ervice if you like to have it."</P>
<P>Taking the &s;ilence of the baronet for con|&s;ent, though, in truth, he was &s;ilent becau&s;e he had not recovered him&s;elf enough to &s;peak, Jerom received the letter and began:</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>TO SIR GUISE STUART, BARONET.</P>
<P>By favour of his mo&s;t excellent, and never enough to be loved daughter.</P>
<P>Honoured, and, as I may now &s;ay by God's grace, honourable, Sir&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be God for it: We are told, your honour, that nothing has, for a great while, been new under the &s;un, and that there has been an end put to miracles ever &s;ince the bible times&mdash;now that I take to be&mdash;to be&mdash;to be&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>What is that word Jonathan&mdash;he's as long as my leg.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="286">"And a pretty deal more crooked," an&s;wered Jonathan, looking over his cou&s;in's &s;houlder, "but I have him for all that&mdash; pokrifal, you fool, pokrifal, who's the be&s;t &s;cholar now I wonder?"</P>
<P>Jerom, clapping him on the &s;houlder, &s;aid, "You are a fine old Greecein to be &s;ure," and proceeded: "Now that I take to be pokri|fal &mdash;for fir&s;t it's new to &s;ee, your honour, what I hear, with great joy, you now are beginning to be, that the &s;un, old as he is, mayhap &s;hall hardly &s;hine on the like again&mdash; and, &s;econdly, &s;o bad as you have been many long years, nothing but a marvellous miracle could make a good chri&s;tian man of you again&mdash;for 'tis ea&s;ier for a leopard to change his &s;pots&mdash;you under&s;tand me, your honour&mdash; &s;o I dare &s;ay that, under God's favour, a miracle, and no &s;mall one, has been made on purpo&s;e for your honour."</P>
<P>"Daddy Denni&s;on is a brave, &s;en&s;ical, old youth, an't he coz," &s;aid Jonathan.</P>
<P>"Don't put me out," an&s;wered Jerom&mdash;
<PB N="277" REF="287">"O, &s;ir, were the dear, good, real, lady Stuart, whom you&mdash;you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Better &s;kip the next word, I fancy, coz," &s;aid Jerom, he&s;itating&mdash;" &s;ee here, ju&s;t where I have put my finger."</P>
<P>"It's the devil's own word to be &s;ure," &s;aid Jonathan, "but the &s;teward meant it &s;hould be read, or he would not have put it down, be&s;ides the thing's true, and &s;o what &s;ignifies mincing of it?"</P>
<P>"Read on," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, Jerom con|tinued, "<HI>Real</HI> Lady Stuart, whom you MURDERED, as a body may &s;ay by inches, were &s;he alive to witne&s;s this good turn, &s;he would almo&s;t die again with joy, but for that matter &s;he does &s;ee it where &s;he now is; and my old heart bounds to think there is now a chance you may meet her: how mu&s;t your honour al&s;o feel when you have got a little over the &s;hame on't to have your all|good &s;on and daughter by your &s;ide to forgive you, and to make your bed in your &s;ickne&s;s, as the &s;cripture &s;aith. Your honour &s;hould have old Denni&s;on about you too, but that I am rather dim &s;ighted of late, and moreover
<PB N="278" REF="288">could no otherwi&s;e but by &s;taying behind to keep hou&s;e, and nur&s;e my age, prevail on young ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to go in com|fort. So I thought the only way to &s;hew my love, at this great di&s;tance, would be to indite my thoughts in a letter that your honour might know I was not the lea&s;t glad to find you &s;uch an altered man&mdash;and from being the greate&s;t&mdash;the greate&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>"Here's another word," &s;aid Jerom, checking him&s;elf, "which his honour may not like&mdash;looke."</P>
<P>"Lord you are &s;o &s;queami&s;h&mdash;come I'll fini&s;h it," ob&s;erved Jonathan, taking the let|ter and reading on&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;"And from being the greate&s;t &s;inner, I think, I ever knew, are getting to be the greate&s;t penitent; and heaven can tell it &s;hould be &s;o, el&s;e the one can never be able to &s;et off the other: I mention the&s;e things now out of pure kindne&s;s, that you may not imagine you have repented enough&mdash;for, alas! if your honour &s;hould live to the age of Mathu&s;alem, and go in &s;ack-cloth and
<PB N="279" REF="289">a&s;hes all the time, it would not be too much, &s;eeing what is pa&s;t."</P>
<P>A groan here i&s;&s;ued from the bo&s;om of Sir Gui&s;e. Jonathan whi&s;pered to Jerom, "That the groan was a good omen: but that he was glad he had come almo&s;t to the end of the letter, becau&s;e," &s;aid he, "you &s;ee the poor man's face is covered with tears, and 'tis a pity to whip a hor&s;e to death when he &s;ees his fault, and, after all his freaks, is going the right road. Here's only a bit more to end with, your honour."</P>
<P>"And now honoured, and prai&s;ed be God, as I &s;aid in the beginning,&mdash;honour|able, old,&mdash;and as I may &s;ay&mdash;new ma&s;ter, wi&s;hing you may go on with the good work, &s;o that although your &s;ins have been as &s;carlet, they may become white as &s;now, which we are told in holy writ, &s;hall be the ca&s;e to all true repenters, I am, always, Your old faithful &s;ervant, to command, NESTOR DENNISON."</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="290">
"But there's a po&s;t&s;cript," ob&s;erved Je|rom, "only a few lines though"&mdash;</P>
<P>"We have all, young and old, lived here, as I may &s;ay, like people taken out of a pe&s;t-hou&s;e, and put all at once into a paradi&s;e; but this, your honour, will hear from better hands. All grace to your honour, and no more at pre&s;ent, but love to every thing at the old abbey, and to little old Fitz if alive;&mdash;I dare &s;ay, if little Fitz knew how your honour had mended your&s;elf, he would come and 'tend you too. As to &s;quire Henry, and madam Olivia, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing,&mdash;but heaven make 'em happy.&mdash;Your honour has not a little to repent of in that quar|ter, &mdash;but I have done."</P>
<P>"And its time you had, old boy," &s;aid Jonathan, folding up the letter and return|ing it to the baronet, who had felt the truth of every pa&s;&s;age at his heart, but made no other comment than that which was writ|ten in his &s;ighs and tears: both which
<PB N="281" REF="291">much affected the young kin&s;men, who u&s;ed every means in their power to con&s;ole him, though, in fact, &s;ome of tho&s;e intended con&s;olations, like Denni&s;on's epi&s;tle, probed, to a &s;alutary end indeed, the deep-&s;eated wound.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Charles and Caroline had been trying to con&s;ole one another: as it was a point pre-&s;ettled by the colonel, that they were not to go beyond the walled-garden at the we&s;t-end of the hou&s;e, for fear of being &s;een and known by any of the villagers: they wandered without, perhaps, knowing their feet were in motion, over &s;everal parts of the hou&s;e it&s;elf. In this ramble, they in&s;en&s;ibly came to the room which Caro|line had appropriated in happier hours, for its parallel &s;ituation to the ca&s;tle. The in&s;tant, however, &s;he had &s;et her foot into it &s;he drew back, as from &s;udden recollection, and would have taken another path, but the lieutenant arre&s;ted her &s;tep, by telling her that he &s;aw from the window &s;everal per|&s;ons coming down the grand avenue.&mdash; "Good heaven!" exclaimed Caroline: "per|haps
<PB N="282" REF="292">I mean, heaven forbid that&mdash;did you &s;ay &s;everal per&s;ons, brother?"&mdash;</P>
<P>While &s;he a&s;ked the que&s;tion, &s;he was mechanically moving forward in a direction which would have enabled her to an&s;wer it her&s;elf, for &s;he approached to the window, rapidly caught a view, not only of the walking porter but of &s;everal well known objects. "I fancy, my dear Charles," &s;aid &s;he, trying to di&s;gui&s;e her &s;en&s;ations, "it mu&s;t be &s;ome of the family, with perhaps our own I&s;landers."&mdash;"Yes," an&s;wered the lieutenant, looking eagerly, "I think I can di&s;tingui&s;h at this di&s;tance my mountain|dai&s;y, Johanna."&mdash;"Let us prepare to re|ceive them," ob&s;erved Caroline, repre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh, but taking her brother's hand, and leaving the chamber, which had al&s;o &s;ome pieces of its ancient furniture, and par|ticularly a little cabinet which &s;he had not time to bring away, but which &s;he now took under her arm.</P>
<P>When they had got back to her own apartment, one of the maids came up to inform her that True George was come
<PB N="283" REF="293">with all manner of good things from the ca&s;tle, and with a me&s;&s;age of love from his lady, &s;aying, that &s;he and her friends were coming to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to partake of them. "They are not far off, ma'am," added the maid, "I, and Letty, &s;aw them &s;ome time ago. They left their carriage at the park gates."</P>
<P>The que&s;tion betwixt the brother and &s;i&s;ter now was, where to receive them. "I &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t be in one of the chambers, for none of the lower rooms I under&s;tand have any furni|ture." &mdash;"O yes, &s;ir," an&s;wered the maid, "the little &s;aloon and parlour on the right hand are as nicely fitted up as ever, though not with any thing that was in them before."</P>
<P>New wonders &s;eemed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Charles and Caroline. They exchanged looks, neither &s;poke, but followed the maid down &s;tairs into the &s;aloon, where the lieute|nant recognized many of his old acquaintance of the ca&s;tle, in the articles that adorned it.</P>
<P>But before they had lei&s;ure to form their feelings on the occa&s;ion, into any thing but de&s;ultory exclamations, the party, which
<PB N="284" REF="294">con&s;i&s;ted of Mrs. Fitzorton, Mrs. Herbert, Johanna, the colonel, and little John, were announced as ju&s;t entering the abbey. Each brought &s;ome te&s;timony of loving-kindne&s;s. One a ba&s;ket of flowers, another of fruits. John Fitzorton had loaded his hands and pockets with food for the mind, while his nephew and &s;i&s;ter-in-law carried between them a &s;mall wicker-pannier, which, the moment after their entrance, was laid at the &s;eet of Caroline Stuart. "I wi&s;h I could tell you the happine&s;s I have in rendering up my tru&s;t," &s;aid Olivia, "were my Henry here, he would do it for me,&mdash;he, who has an eloquence proper for every occa&s;ion; but in his ab&s;ence, as none of the&s;e good people &s;eem willing to help me out, I mu&s;t e'en tru&s;t to your known goodne&s;s, &s;weet friend, and &s;ee whether the offering it&s;elf can &s;upply my defects."</P>
<P>Olivia took the peg from the cover of the pannier, and the lid being laid open, upro&s;e to the view of the company, the now almo&s;t withered, but &s;till &s;ilky head of Caroline's favoured &s;paniel, poor old Fitz: his eyes,
<PB N="285" REF="295">like Denni&s;on's, were dim; his deep brown and once redundant ears, the hair of which was wont to curl like a cupid's head, hung languid down, and, although he had &s;hared every delicacy with Henry and Olivia, the wa&s;ting power of time had made his face look meagre, while the other parts of his body, even amid&s;t every &s;ign of care and love, bore the marks of decay. He was &s;till, however, &s;leek: to his protectors he had been intere&s;ting, and the tokens of a good old age were in his countenance. He was received by his long ab&s;ent mi&s;tre&s;s with all the cordiality that attached to him: in|deed, &s;o many were the &s;en&s;ations, that the unexpected &s;ight of him brought into her mind's eye, that her corporeal one could not hold its tears, while the cau&s;e of them him|&s;elf, after being lifted from his downy bed in the pannier, and often pa&s;&s;ing his face over the lovely hand that care&s;&s;ed him, began to &s;hew &s;igns of grateful recognition.</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Caroline, if it had been po&s;&s;ible," cried Mrs. Fitzorton, "I
<PB N="286" REF="296">would have re&s;tored him to you in all the beauty that graced him at your departure, and had you &s;een how anxious Henry has been to keep him from &s;uffering, even by the power of time&mdash;alas! the &s;poiler of us all!&mdash;you would have loved him for it. And the dog loved him for it too&mdash;for I am in favour only when my hu&s;band is ab&s;ent. Yes, Fitz," continued Olivia, "you know, when your ma&s;ter is at home, I am but a kind of &s;econd-be&s;t with you.&mdash;He, who, as one of his favourite bards expre&s;&s;es it, was 'made to engage all hearts' is your fir&s;t love; &s;o he is mine, and yet though you have been my rival I forgive you."</P>
<P>While Olivia thus talked to, and fondled little Fitz, Johanna and Charles had got into a little <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> in another part of the &s;a|loon&mdash; as had the colonel and Mrs. Herbert. With re&s;pect to Caroline, although nothing could be more apparently trivial than what had dropped from Mrs. Fitzorton, on the topic of the four-footed favourite&mdash;an old, decrepid little animal&mdash;&s;he felt it of the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="287" REF="297">importance, and had never known an event in her life that required more manage|ment to prevent its being noticed, that, &s;he paid the circum&s;tance a di&s;proportionate at|tention.</P>
<P>Little John, with that acute remark which belongs to children, a&s;ked his mother, "if the lady was not taken very ill; and I am &s;ure, &s;aid he, 'tis a pity &s;uch pretty eyes &s;hould ever weep&mdash;yet, any body may &s;ee, there are tears in them now.&mdash;Except your|&s;elf, mamma, I think I never &s;aw &s;o hand|&s;ome a lady&mdash;and I dare &s;ay, papa would think &s;o too. I'll write to him about her."</P>
<P>Caroline over-heard part of this: &s;ome of it caught the ear of John Fitzorton, who walk|ed re&s;tle&s;s about the room, then de&s;iring Johanna to join Olivia, he &s;aid to Charles, in a governed voice, "Lieutenant, I fear your &s;i&s;ter is &s;till unhappy! You &s;hould have told me this." "I knew it not my&s;elf," an|&s;wered Charles.</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t appear &s;trange," cried Caroline,
<PB N="288" REF="298">as if con&s;cious &s;he had excited conver&s;ation, "that I &s;hould have be&s;towed on this little brute &s;o much more than is his due, while I am in the pre&s;ence of &s;o many per&s;ons who have higher claims to my grateful attention; but the truth is, I am every way &s;o &s;urround|ed by tho&s;e invaluable claimants, and feel &s;o powerfully the impayable debt I owe them, that I &s;hrink under the con&s;cious weight of unnumbered obligations, and deplore the in|&s;ignificancy of my powers to expre&s;s my feelings."</P>
<P>"Expre&s;s them only, &s;weet Caroline," &s;aid Olivia, "in being happy&mdash;in thinking that you are part of our&s;elves&mdash;in believing that Providence has, at length, heard our mutual prayers&mdash;your's in rendering a parent worthy of your love; our's in bringing you, after many a fruitle&s;s wi&s;h, within reach of friends &s;o very precious to us. I cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed at your pre&s;ent emotions: I know full well they mu&s;t partake equally of pain and plea&s;ure; but the former, I tru&s;t, will hourly decrea&s;e, and the latter receive &s;ome large additions."</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="299">The air of &s;oothing, and the accents of encouragement, with which the admirable Olivia &s;poke this, the genero&s;ity of its mo|tive, and the &s;oft blandi&s;hments which illu&s;|trated, by tender action, every heart-felt word, wrought powerfully on the grateful Caroline, who &s;uffered her&s;elf to be heard: and on Olivia's expre&s;&s;ing a hope that &s;he found Sir Gui&s;e better, and the abbey a little more like its former &s;elf than fame had rumoured it, Caroline &s;aid, &s;milingly, "that &s;he &s;hould have thought it all the work of &s;ome good Genii, had &s;he not long known that a race of beings, &s;uperior in benevolence to every fabled creation, re&s;ided in Fitzorton ca&s;tle, and di&s;per&s;ed their ble&s;&s;ings to all around&mdash; and to &s;uch magicians &s;he attributed the en|chantments which awaited her own, and her brother's return to the abbey.</P>
<P>Thus by a happy and innocent compli|ment to the family in general, did Caroline throw a timely veil over the particular cau&s;e of her late perplexity.</P>
<P>John Fitzorton, however, &s;till appeared anxious, and traver&s;ed from one party to an|other
<PB N="290" REF="300">without fixing near any body long enough to begin di&s;cour&s;e. His di&s;quietude was &s;ilently noticed by Olivia, who, imput|ing it all to tender emotions in the pre&s;ence of his beloved Caroline, &s;tole towards him with an "a&s;&s;urance, that all the&s;e inevitable a&s;perities would in time &s;often, and that though &s;he would not betray his &s;ecret for the world, &s;he could not but think many things which had dropped from Caroline, admitted an interpretation in his favour.&mdash; The&s;e &s;he promi&s;ed to impart when &s;he got home; and as Sir Gui&s;e was now re&s;tored to virtue, &s;he hoped her dear John would not &s;hut up his mind again&s;t any kind impre&s;|&s;ions."</P>
<P>While John was con&s;idering whether it would be be&s;t to let Olivia continue this mi&s;|take, or to correct it in part, Mrs. Herbert came forward to &s;ay, that Caroline had been &s;ugge&s;ting the impo&s;&s;ibility of quitting her father &s;o &s;oon, and had intreated her to in|tercede with the colonel for her and her party remaining &s;ome time longer. "O, by

<P>Johanna and the lieutenant again got to|gether. "Ah! my Charles," exclaimed the former, not in jealous, but in con&s;ciou&s;ly humble accents, "would I had never &s;een the lovely Olivia! your affection for me, you have often &s;aid, was grounded on a fancied re&s;emblance of her, and if &s;o, O how mu&s;t the poor ineffectual copy fade in your eye in a compari&s;on of the original, which, &s;ure|ly, is grace and loveline&s;s it&s;elf!&mdash;I have &s;hrunk, even in my own idea, ever &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw her in this meridian &s;plendour of her charms.

Charles could only reply to this by an ardent glance, and gentle pre&s;&s;ure of the hand, for Arthur, Flore&s;co, and the apothecary came into the room, with a &s;ummons from Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, who under&s;tanding there were &s;ome of the ca&s;tle family below, &s;aid he &s;hould think him&s;elf honoured if any of them would deign to attend his &s;on and daughter into his chamber, that he might pour before them his true thanks for their unbounded goodne&s;s to him and his. Burton &s;aid he believed the vi&s;it would act upon the &s;pirits of his patient, as a richer cordial than any he could pre&s;cribe for him. Arthur in&s;i&s;ted it would be an act of &s;piritual charity. Caro|line pleaded eloquently, without uttering a word. Olivia took the hand of the latter, and &s;aid, &s;he would an&s;wer for the a&s;&s;ent of Johanna and Mrs. Herbert, to every thing
<PB N="293" REF="303">Arthur had pronounced charitable: "John, I am &s;ure," added &s;he, "cannot refu&s;e to promote his own good work." "No," &s;aid his nephew, "though my uncle is a philo&s;o|pher, he can ju&s;t laugh and cry like a little brat, as I am; I have made him often do both my&s;elf&mdash;&s;o has &s;i&s;ter Carry."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides wi&s;hing to do every good he at|tempted, effectually, John de&s;ired to &s;ee how the long-implored, and, at length, granted reque&s;t of Sir Gui&s;e to &s;ee his children, had operated, "if the lieutenant leads," &s;aid he, "the colonel &s;hall follow, although contrary to military etiquette."</P>
<P>"I thought," ob&s;erved Olivia, "that in all the little matters of this great world, we women were the commanding officers, and that wherever the ladies led, not only cap|tains and colonels, but all their armies were proud to follow; however, as we depute lieutenant Charles and colonel John our aid-de-camps on the occa&s;ion, we order them to go forward."</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="304">"If poet papa had been here," cried little John, "I know what he would have called them." "What!" que&s;tioned the colonel, "not aid-de-camps, but gentlemen of the bedchamber, uncle, and if I can get to the room fir&s;t, I &s;hall be the page in waiting, you know."</P>
<P>Little John, bribing the apothecary to accompany him, ran out of the &s;aloon, and if there had before been any difficulty, his apt and playful allu&s;ion would have &s;ettled it: the feelings of the party, which had been &s;omewhat entangled in a labyrinth, by the preceding conver&s;ation, now concentrated in one generous point, and they were conducted by Charles to his father's chamber.</P>

<P>NEITHER little John, however, nor his friend the apothecary, though both nimble-footed beings, were the fir&s;t per&s;ons of the groupe who reached the afore&s;aid apartment.
<PB N="295" REF="305">Arthur's Flore&s;co no &s;ooner under&s;tood, from a whi&s;per of his ma&s;ter, that it was the in|tention of the party to indulge the baronet in his de&s;ire, than he &s;lipped imperceptibly out of the &s;aloon, while the company were &s;ettling the order of their going: he luckily met True George, to whom he imparted the news, and both flew with it to Sir Gui&s;e, who no &s;ooner heard the tidings, than he begged George would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;ome little preparations for their reception. Ex|erting, therefore, all his force, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted not only by George and Flore&s;co, but the egregious letter readers, Jonathan and Je|rom &mdash;the good apothecary, and his young companion, found the valetudinarian faint, from the labours of equipment, or rather of &s;upporting the fatigue of being equipped, but arrayed in one of the comfortable changes of an invalid's wardrobe, which the diligent and pious love of Caroline had purcha&s;ed on her way, in addition to what had been &s;upplied by the con&s;iderate friend&s;hip of co|lonel Fitzorton and Olivia.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="306">The party on entering were plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve Sir Gui&s;e Stuart able to receive them in that manner. He te&s;tified the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of obligation to all in gene|ral, but repeatedly called the colonel the re|&s;torer of his children and him&s;elf. Some&mdash; he ob&s;erved, looking fir&s;t at Olivia, then at George, were ab&s;ent&mdash;whom he dared not expect to &s;ee, but for whom he had poured his daily, hourly prayers.</P>
<P>"He means my beloved Henry, and dear Jane Atwood," whi&s;pered Olivia to Caro|line.</P>
<P>"Yet if all now pre&s;ent will chear my throbbing heart with the &s;ounds of forgive|ne&s;s, unde&s;erved as I feel it is, I may &s;till hope that the pardon of the ab&s;ent, great as have been my offences to them, may in time be added unto me."</P>
<P>He next in&s;i&s;ted upon kneeling under the &s;upport of his children, to receive the for|givene&s;s of the company, and when he was led to True George, that humble creature, unable to &s;ee his &s;uperior in &s;tation in any
<PB N="297" REF="307">po&s;ture that implied conde&s;cen&s;ion, without meeting him on equal terms, bent his knee to the baronet at the &s;ame time, and a&s;&s;ured him in a generous whi&s;per, "that it &s;hould not be long before his forgivene&s;s was &s;ealed by both the certain per&s;ons he had alluded to; mean|while he begged him to believe that, he could an&s;wer for it, neither the one nor the other bore him any malice."</P>
<P>Flore&s;co had thrown him&s;elf into a &s;uppli|cating po&s;ition, in a quiet corner, almo&s;t folded in the bed curtains.</P>
<P>The good Burton was very de&s;irous to &s;horten this &s;cene, which, he ob&s;erved, was becoming much too &s;trong for his patient: but the mo&s;t trying part which the latter had allotted to him&s;elf was yet to be performed. "Grant me, I pray you," &s;aid the almo&s;t exhau&s;ted man, "the indulgence of another moment,&mdash;while in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e I have wronged, I now publickly &s;olicit what has already been privately granted to me, the forgivene&s;s of the two beings I have the mo&s;t injured. O pardon, pardon my children, the author of your lives, as of all the tyrannies,
<PB N="298" REF="308">torments and frauds which have rendered tho&s;e lives intolerable. Pardon him who has deprived you of health, peace, fortune, and, &s;everer than all, of a parent worthy of your loves, good, virtuous, and &s;incere. Pardon him whom you ought to execrate, pray for him whom you ought to de&s;pi&s;e, de&s;ert, and cur&s;e, in return, O God in ju&s;t return, for the cur&s;es he has poured on you!"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e had &s;unk from the arms of his children on his knees, and folded his trem|bling hands, and lifted up his &s;treaming eyes. Finding it in vain to attempt checking the effu&s;ion of his &s;urcharged heart, his &s;on and daughter knelt with him, and by every ten|der evidence their own &s;ituation allowed, &s;trove to convince him he had atoned for every thing. Charles importuned him for pardon on his own impetuous, and perhaps unfilial errors, in&s;tead of imitating his meek and uncomplaining &s;i&s;ter. Caroline, wholly regardle&s;s of &s;o many ob&s;ervers, was only intent to rai&s;e her father from his humiliating po&s;ture; and this being effected by means
<PB N="299" REF="309">of the colonel and True George, Jerom and Jonathan having left the room, he was no &s;ooner replaced on the bed, than Caro|line entreated the company would leave him to compo&s;ure, in the care of her&s;elf and Charles. She then concealed her father from ob&s;ervation, by drawing the curtains round him, knelt by his &s;ide, and while &s;he u&s;ed every &s;oothing power of her ten|der heart, conjured him to believe that he had not only conciliated the re&s;pect of all who had heard, all who had &s;een his di&s;|tre&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her own and her brother's tendere&s;t love; but that he might be con|vinced the angel &s;pirit of his wife, and the &s;pirit of God him&s;elf would be his propi|tiated guardians.</P>
<P>Father Arthur confirmed this in the name of the Almighty.</P>
<P>With great difficulty John got his &s;ympa|thizing friends out of the chamber. Every one offering to be the nur&s;e of the father and a&s;&s;ociate of the child. Burton, however, &s;ugge&s;ting that the very life of &s;ir Gui&s;e, who, he &s;aid, was in a much more perilous
<PB N="300" REF="310">&s;tate than they imagined, depended on their ob&s;erving the wi&s;e and delicate reque&s;t of his daughter, they went down &s;tairs. The company waited in the &s;aloon till the apo|thecary had again vi&s;ited his patient, and as he perceived the only re&s;toratives to be hoped were re&s;t and quiet; he had intere&s;t enough with the party to per&s;uade them to return home, which they did after one of Caroline's women, following the orders of Olivia, had &s;oftly taken up little Fitz into Caroline's own chamber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>IN this exhau&s;ted &s;tate however, the lulling powers of the apothecary's pre&s;crip|tion, and of &s;lumber, gradually re&s;tored &s;ir Gui&s;e, of who&s;e comparative recovery a me&s;&s;age was taken by the worthy Burton him&s;elf to the ca&s;tle, after his evening vi&s;it to the abbey; but the baronet's &s;ituation was pronounced, in an&s;wer to John's &s;till earne&s;t enquiries, too precarious either for his
<PB N="301" REF="311">removal to any other place, or for with|drawing the con&s;olation of his children.</P>
<P>It was, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary for John to &s;end away the carriages, and that the drivers might not commit any blunders by unnece&s;&s;ary go&s;&s;ipings on the road, it was determined that, as True George might be wanted at home, Jerom and Jonathan &s;hould, on pretence of having bu&s;ine&s;s that way, &s;ee them &s;afe back to town: for, although when Irwin recommended them, he &s;aid they were to be tru&s;ted&mdash;the colonel had frequently expre&s;&s;ed regret on the journey, when it was too late to make new arrange|ments, that he had not thought of Jerom and Jonathan, and even Irwin him&s;elf, rather than confide in any per&s;ons more imme|diately out of the family: but, alas! &s;uch is the imperfection of human fore&s;ight even in the mo&s;t &s;agacious minds. The plan, how|ever, of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the chai&s;es, appearing the fir&s;t be&s;t mea&s;ure to be taken, the two tru&s;ty cou&s;ins &s;portingly told their &s;weethearts at Little Brixham, they were going to Lon|don to buy them gingerbread hu&s;bands, and
<PB N="302" REF="312">receiving due in&s;tructions from the colonel, began their journey in the du&s;k of that very evening.</P>
<P>But this mea&s;ure went to the removal of only one, and that an incon&s;iderable perplexity, in the project with which John Fitzorton had embarra&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. Prompted, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by the exhilarating thought of encou|raging penitence, of obtaining a victory over that hate, of which he now thought the remains ought not to harbour in his bo&s;om, again&s;t a puni&s;hed foe, who &s;ought his mercy, anxious to mitigate the dire pangs of two worthy children, who were hiding their heads from an iniquitous parent, and flat|tering him&s;elf that the gratification he wi&s;hed to gain for both parties, might be carried on, and completed without any counteraction of events, he forgot to provide again&s;t many points of which his heart, though u&s;ually provident, had not &s;uffered him to &s;u&s;pect the danger. Henry him&s;elf could not have precipitated a benevolence with a more fervid but perilous rapidity.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="313">The time of Mrs. Fitzorton's confine|ment, from the pro&s;pect of a third child, drew near; the return of her hu&s;band could not, in affection, or in propriety, be long protracted; Olivia grew daily more and more fond of Caroline's &s;ociety, and he him&s;elf became &s;hocked at the idea that he might have led the latter into an inevi|table relap&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility, on the &s;harp point of which, though her principles would remain un&s;haken, her heart might receive an involuntary wound. He knew from him|&s;elf the po&s;&s;ibility, of uniting the weakne&s;s of &s;en&s;ation with the &s;trength of practical vir|tue: and he felt by experience al&s;o, that as a &s;oldier and a man, <HI>retreat</HI> was often the only mea&s;ure of &s;ecurity: and as to the doctrine of annihilating the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul, while their &s;overeign objects were brought clo&s;e under the eye, he allowed the duty of inculcating it, and felt the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;entiment, of daily praying not to be led into temptation: for though every im|pure thought will be expelled, even if, for a moment, it &s;hould dare to approach the
<PB N="304" REF="314">truly virtuous mind, the thought may be pure, while the heart, the very &s;ource of that purity, <Q>May bleed and agonize at every pore.</Q> He was not altogether at ea&s;e with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of the lieutenant's affections; his own had long been under the de&s;poti&s;m of his determined &s;way: he continued a tyrant on him&s;elf, and wrenched the &s;ceptre from each unruly pa&s;&s;ion as it made head again&s;t him. But he &s;oon &s;aw that the ill-&s;mothered affections of Henry, the half-re&s;tored peace of Caroline, and the hitherto well managed happine&s;s of Olivia, were all again at hazard, and made &s;o even by a project of his own.</P>
<P>Reflections of this kind began to hara&s;s him as he returned with his party to the ca&s;tle, after the intere&s;ting &s;cene in the baro|net's chamber.</P>
<P>Every &s;ucceeding day increa&s;ed the appre|hen&s;ion, and there was not one with whom he could &s;hare the confidence, &s;ave the
<PB N="305" REF="315">lieutenant, who, except in his own ca&s;e, &s;aw clearly the danger, but no immediate way of removing it; as his father alternately recovered and relap&s;ed, and though his life would not probably be long, he felt it a kind of parricide to &s;horten it by leaving him.</P>
<P>Olivia al&s;o began to be importunate on the &s;ubject of Henry. She allowed every merit to John's original motive, but &s;aid, that matters at the abbey had taken upon the whole &s;o happy a turn, that &s;he thought it would do her hu&s;band rather good than harm to make him partaker of the general felicity. She &s;ubmitted to John, whether there was not &s;omething cruel in thus &s;hut|ting him out of his &s;hare of joy in the return of Henry's friend? As John did not well know how to get rid of the&s;e rea&s;onings, he remained &s;ilent, which being taken for a &s;pecies of a&s;&s;ent, &s;he followed up her &s;up|po&s;ed advantages, &s;ometimes by the aid of Mrs. Herbert and Johanna, and &s;ometimes Olivia would call in Caroline her&s;elf as an auxiliary; and &s;he attributed the embarra&s;&s;|ment
<PB N="306" REF="316">which &s;he di&s;covered in that young lady to an unwillingne&s;s to oppo&s;e any mea|&s;ure in which John Fitzorton did not &s;eem heartily to concur.</P>
<P>And as if the&s;e entanglements wanted yet another twi&s;t, Olivia hinted to John her perfect a&s;&s;urance that he would find in her hu&s;band the warme&s;t friend his pa&s;&s;ion for Caroline could wi&s;h, and that even upon that account his pre&s;ence was de&s;irable. Although, &s;aid &s;he, the uncertain &s;tate of &s;ir Gui&s;e's health, would make it indelicate and un&s;ea&s;onable to point to &s;ubjects of that kind, I have omitted no occa&s;ion &s;ince her arrival to do ju&s;tice to your merits, of which, indeed, I find her impre&s;&s;ed in a manner the mo&s;t favourable.</P>
<P>This opinion was now &s;o fixed in Mrs. Fitz|orton's imagination, that at every opportu|nity &s;he &s;poke of her brother John's various excellencies&mdash;and although, &s;aid &s;he, "that beloved being, who, I hope, will &s;hortly be among&s;t us, yields to none the palm either of genius or goodne&s;s, and &s;eems every hour to gain new attractions, by a certain peculiar
<PB N="307" REF="317">tenderne&s;s that attaches to all he &s;ays or does&mdash;pardon me, for paying him in ab&s;ence this pa&s;&s;ing tribute which ri&s;es from my full heart.&mdash;I know not any head, or any heart, but tho&s;e of Henry, which can vie with John Fitzorton's."</P>
<P>Glad of a &s;ubject which might give a re|lieving turn to that which Olivia had excited, Caroline fa&s;tened with an eager ha&s;te on the merits of a man who luckily &s;upplied her with abundant &s;ources of eulogy. Finding that Mrs. Fitzorton only knew, partially, the hi&s;tory of the colonel's protective goodne&s;s to her&s;elf and friends, &s;he gave the particu|lars of this patronage in the mo&s;t generous and glowing colours. Warmed by the hone&s;t theme, &s;he ro&s;e above all &s;elfi&s;h emotions, and drew the character of that exalted man, till &s;he affected her fair auditor even to tears; and although Olivia conceived &s;omewhat le&s;s of John's conduct, as to its di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, even than it de&s;erved, thinking the grand agent therein to be love, and allowed le&s;s merit al&s;o to Caroline's encomiums, which,
<PB N="308" REF="318">in&s;tead of confining to gratitude, &s;he im|puted to love al&s;o; &s;he &s;aw clearly her bro|ther's manly hand, and beneficent heart, in various characteri&s;tic di&s;plays. When Caro|line's incen&s;e was paid, Olivia felt her&s;elf called upon by the voice of equity, and of love likewi&s;e, to mention the part which her Henry had taken in the affairs of Caroline and Charles.&mdash;How often we have traced your paths, pau&s;ed in your &s;hades, prai&s;ed your virtues, wept at your misfortunes&mdash;your's, and the lieutenant's!&mdash;abroad and at home, you have mingled in our hopes, our fears&mdash; and although, from a generous apprehen&s;ion that my Henry, who&s;e health and &s;pirits are of late uncertain, might feel too powerfully from the &s;udden &s;ight of friends &s;o long de|&s;paired of, the excellent John has projected a temporary ab&s;ence; doubt not, but when we have prepared him for the joy of &s;uch a meet|ing, Caroline, that his happine&s;s will be &s;upreme. Meanwhile, though I acknow|ledge that our brother has entitled him&s;elf, by more important &s;ervices, to the fir&s;t place,
<PB N="309" REF="319">as E&s;au appropriated the birth-right, my Henry has a claim to the &s;econd: nor mu&s;t I forget to inform you, that a little &s;tranger, who is now with her father, our fir&s;t born, is honoured by bearing your name, and I hope &s;oon to pre&s;ent her.</P>
<P>John Fitzorton joined them abruptly, ju&s;t as Olivia fini&s;hed, and thinking it the mo|ment in which he would appear in lu&s;tre before Caroline, would have left them toge|ther, but that the colonel expre&s;&s;ed a ha&s;ty and eager de&s;ire to confer with Olivia on &s;ome di&s;patches he had received from Par|tington. She therefore took an affectionate leave of Caroline, and attended John home.</P>
<P>On the return of our amiable Caroline into the abbey,&mdash;for the preceding interview had taken place in the flower garden;&mdash; &s;he was acco&s;ted by the good Arthur, who was ju&s;t de&s;cending from the ori&s;ons he had been offering up in the baronet's apartment. The report he made of that unfortunate man's mind was no le&s;s favourable than what the apothecary had been able to &s;end her of his body. "He has had another comfortable
<PB N="310" REF="320">repo&s;e," &s;aid he, "and his piety is uniform even when his health is irregular. And I have received a welcome pre&s;ent this morn|ing, my dear child, upon which I am &s;ure you will congratulate me&mdash;ob&s;erve," conti|nued he, taking a &s;mall parcel from his pocket&mdash;"folded in this careful envelope, and wrapt literally up in cotton&mdash;ob&s;erve, my child, the keys of my chapel-hou&s;e, chapel, and the hallowed &s;anctuary to which it leads: on the out&s;ide of my parcel you &s;ee is written, in fair and legible cha|racters, words that de&s;cribe at once&mdash; benevolence and truth. 'Sacred depo&s;its.' "The hand," exclaimed Caroline, "is"&mdash; "No matter who&s;e the hand," &s;aid father Arthur,&mdash;"the heart that governed it was bountiful, noble&mdash;and re&s;tores to me more than recovered empires. Dear and holy &s;cenes! I will offer the tribute of my thanks to the generous beings who have &s;aved you from prophanation, and although, haply, I may find in you the marks of a de&s;olated, long ab&s;ent friend, thy altered &s;tate &s;hall but the more endear thee to Arthur."</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="321">"And to Caroline," &s;ighed &s;he.</P>
<P>"And poor Flore&s;co &s;hall make thee all as him was u&s;ed," cried the little Indian, who bounded at the thought of once more &s;eeing the &s;cenes of his early care; and as Arthur delivered to him the keys, he pre&s;&s;ed them to his lips, to give them welcomes.</P>
<P>The colonel, who had received them from Olivia, pre&s;ented them to Arthur, only intreating that if they were made u&s;e of, it might be late in an evening, to avoid that di&s;covery which he now found &s;o diffi|cult, yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be prevented. Ca|roline's &s;ecret thoughts, however, had gone to the mo&s;t holy places to which the&s;e keys appertained, almo&s;t immediately on her ar|rival, and though &s;he did not know how to give tho&s;e thoughts a voice, from the fear of &s;eeming to pre&s;s on the colonel's exhortation to keep within the bounds of the immured flower-garden, and abbey, &s;he hailed the pro&s;pect of having her &s;ollicitude on this &s;ubject granted without importunity. Her wi&s;hes being now made known to the good
<PB N="312" REF="322">Arthur, he readily gave his promi&s;e to be her conductor on the very fir&s;t evening &s;he could be &s;pared with &s;atisfaction to her&s;elf from her attendance on Sir Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Arthur him&s;elf, however, re&s;olved to de|dicate the coming night to his ancient abode. It will be be&s;t that I and my little white-hearted black man &s;hould go fir&s;t, and make our little preparations. Flore&s;co embraced, as u&s;ual, his ma&s;ter's robes, at finding him|&s;elf included in the vi&s;it to the &s;pot where he had received the fir&s;t precepts of chri&s;tianity, and the fir&s;t pure idea of a God.</P>

<P>MEANTIME the trials of Caroline accu|mulated from every quarter. They frequently pur&s;ued her into her father's chamber, where, as &s;he watched the too languid or too fervid pul&s;e, or held the now parched, and now humid hand of Sir Gui&s;e, he would fre|quently lament, among&s;t the other cau&s;es of
<PB N="313" REF="323">his regret, the di&s;ingenuous part he had acted, in regard to her&s;elf and Henry Fitzorton; in reply to all which, though &s;he felt the truth of every word, like a poi&s;oned arrow, who&s;e barb had been left to rankle in her heart, &s;he would unmurmuringly "beg him to be comforted on every part of that &s;ubject, as the per&s;on he mentioned, not only con&s;tituted the happine&s;s of one of the mo&s;t amiable of human kind, but was, &s;he tru&s;ted, &s;upremely happy him&s;elf; and when a more particular review of the&s;e afflictive circum&s;tances made it impo&s;&s;ible for her to an&s;wer, &s;he would pour the balms of &s;ilent forgivene&s;s on her &s;elf-execrating parent, by a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he con&s;idered Mrs. Fitz|orton's goodne&s;s, manife&s;ted both at the ca&s;tle and the abbey, as de&s;erving every ble&s;&s;ing heaven could be&s;tow, and that &s;he loved, revered, and honoured her, beyond any woman then living:" in which a&s;&s;u|rance &s;he exceeded not the truth.</P>
<P>On returning to her father's apartment, from her conver&s;ation with Arthur, &s;he had the heart-felt comfort of finding him &s;o
<PB N="314" REF="324">much mended as to conver&s;e on &s;everal to|pics he had never before agitated. He re|quired from his attendant children, the hi&s;tory of their wanderings, and as Caroline ima|gined the knowledge of John Fitzorton's guardian&s;hip of her&s;elf and party, would tend to e&s;tabli&s;h a reconciling &s;entiment, &s;he re|peated to her father what &s;he had told to Olivia. It is not po&s;&s;ible to paint the mingled emotions of admiration and re&s;pect Sir Gui&s;e now felt for the colonel, or the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and &s;elf-aba&s;ement for him&s;elf. At a more compo&s;ed moment, however, of the &s;ame day, he ea&s;ed his now &s;inking and now over-flowing heart, by entering into a detail of the conduct of Olivia and True George towards him, as it had been reported in dif|ferent conver&s;ations by the apothecary.</P>
<P>The brother and &s;i&s;ter now heard all that part of the benevolent &s;tory which appertained to Olivia, and which &s;he had omitted in her own narration; fre&s;h cau&s;es of admiration and of grati|tude to both Olivia and George were hence di&s;|covered, and it was made manife&s;t what mighty
<PB N="315" REF="325">ble&s;&s;ings the&s;e two excellent beings, under the conduct of John Fitzorton, had be&s;towed. The good Burton's own benignity was next the &s;ubject of the baronet's eulogy: the vo|luntary attendance of Jonathan and Jerom had their due &s;hare of his prai&s;e&mdash;and, in fine, from this evening's di&s;cour&s;e, in addi|tion to what &s;he had before gathered from Olivia, a complete hi&s;tory of the tran&s;actions of the abbey and the ca&s;tle, from the time of her departure even unto that moment, was in Caroline's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her whole &s;oul was filled with wonder, and with prai&s;e; and combining the bounty and protection which &s;he and her deare&s;t friends had received from the &s;ame &s;ources, &s;he ro&s;e in pious thought, and as her meditation a&s;cended from &s;inite to infinite, her &s;pirit communed with that power, who out of darkne&s;s and anarchy, natural and moral, can educe light, and bring forth order.&mdash; "Ah, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, my deare&s;t brother, and my honoured father," exclaimed &s;he, "while all of <HI>us</HI> have thus been in the care of heaven's be&s;t creatures, <HI>they</HI> have been
<PB N="316" REF="326">wrought on in our favour by heaven it|&s;elf! all of us were in need of divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and the manner in which the effects have been brought about cannot leave us a doubt of the cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name," ejaculated Sir Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the baronet confe&s;&s;ed he felt much relieved by having paid the debt he thought due to the patrons of his repent|ance: and although the length and interrup|tions of his narrative had wearied his body, his &s;pirits were lighter, and his mind more refre&s;hed than it had been for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>In this tranquil period father Arthur came into the apartment, and entered on the ve&s;|per duties of his office; the&s;e being ended, the baronet declared his wi&s;h to devote the re&s;t of the night to that repo&s;e which he au|gured he &s;hould be&s;t enjoy, if his &s;lumbers were unbroken by the idea that his too diligent children were lo&s;ing their own nece&s;&s;ary re&s;to|ratives: and this being a point in&s;i&s;ted on by the apothecary, who had come in with Ar|thur, Sir Gui&s;e was left in the care of a &s;ingle
<PB N="317" REF="327">attendant, and the re&s;t of the party re|tired.</P>
<P>They retired, but not to &s;leep. Too many aweful images impre&s;&s;ed the bo&s;oms of the brother and &s;i&s;ter to permit them to in|dulge even the thoughts of repo&s;e. Father Arthur too, and his Indian, were wakeful: the former told Caroline, that a &s;udden me&s;&s;age brought by True George from the colonel, who reque&s;ted to have back the keys, put a &s;top to his intended vi&s;it to the chapel-hou&s;e; but that Mr. Burton had now brought word from the ca&s;tle, "if any of the party felt it material for the quiet of their minds to re&s;ort thither, and had no objection to the pre|&s;ent evening, he and George would be their conductors, and guide them by a <HI>&s;ecret way.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the eager|ne&s;s with which the whole party caught at this propo&s;ition. Caroline enquired earne&s;tly after the &s;ecret way which Burton had inti|mated, and when the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age which led from the uninhabited part of the abbey, and which had been in ancient days the ordinary path from thence to the chapel-hou&s;e,
<PB N="318" REF="328">and which all had frequently heard of, they &s;eemed much to wonder it had not occurred in relief of their late embarra&s;&s;ment: forgetting their minds had been engro&s;&s;ed by a multiplicity of ab&s;orbing objects which kept every power in action. True George ob&s;erved to them that his ma&s;ter, Henry, had often pa&s;&s;ed more time than he &s;hould mention in &s;ome of the rece&s;&s;es of that very pa&s;&s;age, and, to his knowledge, gone at midnight all alone, as he thought, by that path to the abbey.</P>
<P>A univer&s;al wi&s;h to profit of the pre&s;ent opportunity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every one, and O let us not lo&s;e a moment! breathed in a deciding whi&s;|per from Caroline to the re&s;t. George placed a fre&s;h candle in the lantern with which he had been conducting Burton. Lead, &s;aid the lieu|tenant. George was in motion: Franci&s;co took the robe of Arthur and followed: Caroline was conducted by her brother and the apo|thecary. The night was dark, but they pa&s;&s;ed along the ruins without any im|pediment, and gained the trap-door which
<PB N="319" REF="329">&s;hut from ob&s;ervation the &s;teps that led by a very deep de&s;cent into the &s;ubterraneous way. George now begged the company to pau&s;e until he lighted a torch, which he &s;aid he had left a &s;tep or two father on. They &s;topt, but what was their &s;urpri&s;e when he re|turned to them &s;aying, that "the torch had been taken from the place where he had put it." 'It mu&s;t have fallen down,' &s;aid Caro|line, 'but the lantern will do, my good friend, perfectly well.' They went forward &s;lowly; the ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone, mortar and fragments that had fallen in the path, in many parts, made it very difficult to pa&s;s; and the light which was afforded by the taper in the lantern but dimly &s;hewed the ob&s;tructions. Cautiou&s;ly, however, pur&s;uing the path, which, though not in the &s;traight line, was &s;uffici|ently broad in general, they came to a &s;tone &s;eat, projecting from the wall, where Arthur propo&s;ed they &s;hould re&s;t a moment. He prevailed on Caroline to &s;it down.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear good young lady, if you knew how often a certain per&s;on had been on that very &s;eat," &s;ighed George! "Pray,
<PB N="320" REF="330">let us go forward," &s;aid Caroline, ri&s;ing, "I am perfectly able to proceed."&mdash;As they came to a curve in the pa&s;&s;age a little farther on, and which George, holding the lantern, had gained fir&s;t, he exclaimed,&mdash;"Good heavens! look, look, there's my torch, as &s;ure as I am alive." Nothing of this, how|ever, appearing to the company, as in the next in&s;tant they turned the angle, it was attributed to fear, or rather fancy; for George had nothing of the former in his nature. Pre&s;ently they came within &s;ight of another rece&s;s, as they approached which, a dark &s;hadow, re&s;embling a human figure, palpa|bly aro&s;e from the &s;eat in view of the whole company, and ran with great &s;peed along the pa&s;&s;age. On referring to one another it was admitted, that every one had &s;een it at the &s;ame moment, and in the &s;ame point of view; but without making any reflection they pre&s;&s;ed onward, and with very little in|terruption arrived at a large circular open|ing within a few paces of the corre&s;pondent trap-door.&mdash;"There is the torch again," cried George,&mdash;"look, it is now going
<PB N="321" REF="331">away through one of the gaps in the wall!"</P>
<P>It was, indeed, vi&s;ible to all for &s;ome mo|ments, and then di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>"It is very &s;trange," &s;aid Arthur; "yet it cannot be an illu&s;ion to us all: neither can it, if not imaginary, be of ill augury to be|ings &s;eeking a place of peace and holine&s;s&mdash; &s;o let us go fearle&s;s on."</P>
<P>"Perhaps," ob&s;erved Franci&s;co, "it may be the evil &s;pirit that once haunted the poor gentleman in the abbey, and is now wander|ing about this dark di&s;mal &s;pot under ground without any body to &s;peak to it, or keep it company, becau&s;e of its wickedne&s;s."</P>
<P>"As &s;ure as can be that is it," a&s;&s;erted True George, "and it may go on walking and wail|ing that way the&s;e thou&s;and years; but as his reverence &s;ays, if it be the devil him&s;elf, it can have nothing to &s;ay to us&mdash;&s;o here we go again." "I rather apprehend it to be," ob|&s;erved Burton, "if it really be not a decep|tion of our &s;en&s;es, &s;ome of the&mdash;" as the apothecary was proceeding in his con|jecture&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="332">"Hark! hu&s;h!" cried the lieutenant, "I certainly heard &s;ome body &s;peak."</P>
<P>They broke &s;hort their &s;teps, but all was &s;till; they walked forward to the trap-door, when a &s;econd noi&s;e of voices, not their own, induced them to li&s;ten, and the word murder di&s;tinctly i&s;&s;ued from one of the cor|ners of the circular opening.</P>
<P>"In the name of God," demanded Ar|thur, advancing,&mdash;"what is your pur|po&s;e?"</P>
<P>By this time George had gained the trap, and opened the door that led to the &s;ecret &s;teps that conducted to the edge of the fore&s;t, near which &s;tood the chapel-hou&s;e. And ju&s;t as Caroline was preparing to a&s;cend the &s;teps, while George held the lantern to clear her path, the figure which had been &s;een &s;oon after they entered the pa&s;&s;age, now more decidedly human, accompanied by two others, flitted along, and though every one followed and attempted to &s;top them, they gained the top, and were lo&s;t in the fore&s;t almo&s;t in|&s;tantly.</P>

<P>BUT the&s;e my&s;terious appearances were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by magic of a different kind, for taking the wood-path, the little gothic gate that &s;eparated the chapel-hou&s;e front garden from the fore&s;t, pre&s;ented the object of their midnight ramble. The monk, pre|ceding the action by a &s;pontaneous effu&s;ion of his truly pious &s;oul, approached the door of his beloved man&s;ion; and after a&s;&s;uring his friends that whatever unhallowed things might be permitted to hover without its walls, he was certain all within was pure, and holy.</P>
<P>The door opened while he was yet &s;peak|ing as if by an invi&s;ible hand; for on enter|ing, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, no one appeared; but in the next in&s;tant fre&s;h &s;cenes of wonder ro&s;e before them. In the fir&s;t compartment of the chapel-hou&s;e the &s;acred lamp was lighted that hung over the <HI>benetiere.</HI> The crucifixes in the <HI>&s;criptorum,</HI> and in every other part, bore &s;hining marks of con&s;tant and even of reverential care. The dormitory could &s;till
<PB N="324" REF="334">boa&s;t its whole&s;ome couch for the Franci&s;can, and the attendant pallet by its &s;ide was in|vitingly &s;pread for the faithful Flore&s;co&mdash;but how &s;hall we duly de&s;cribe what pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our a&s;toni&s;hed gue&s;ts in the <HI>refec|toire?</HI> how repre&s;ent their &s;en&s;ations on be|holding the table covered mode&s;tly, yet abundantly, with every fruit and flowret of the &s;ea&s;on? and while their admiring eyes were fixed on the&s;e, a &s;weet and &s;olemn breathing &s;ound as of a&euml;rial mu&s;ic, accom|panied by a voice of &s;ofte&s;t melody, invited their attention. All &s;eemed enchantment! and the &s;acred &s;pell was yet &s;tronger when they found both the words and the air, were de&s;igned to gratulate the long-ab&s;ent father of the chapel-hou&s;e and his friends to their mode&s;t re&s;ting-place. As they &s;tood, even at the door of the <HI>refectoire,</HI> li&s;tening, and ob&s;erving on the&s;e, forth i&s;&s;ued, from a &s;mall rece&s;s at the bottom of the room, the en|chanters them&s;elves&mdash;Olivia Fitzorton and Jane Atwood.</P>
<P>The &s;urprize and effect of this encounter upon the whole company, at &s;uch a time,
<PB N="325" REF="335">and in &s;uch a place, was extremely affecting. Divine and human &s;entiments &s;eemed to mix. "Do not imagine," exclaimed Olivia, ad|vancing, "that you are under any conjura|tion. Every thing you &s;ee and hear has fallen out quite in the common way. I expected that the return of the keys, and the good apothecary's offer, would immediately bring you hither; we bu&s;ied our&s;elves therefore in making our little preparations: when all was ready, we per&s;uaded the colonel to conduct us, unknown even to Johanna and Mrs. Herbert, for the delight of a little &s;tratagem of this kind is its my&s;tic &s;ecre&s;y; and here have we been ever &s;ince &s;adly afraid that our commander in chief would return to e&s;cort us back before you came. Pray pardon the deception, and enjoy the reality.</P>
<P>"Fair and virtuous lady," &s;aid Arthur, "had I not before had rea&s;on to believe that the veritable author of all good can in&s;pire &s;ome of his creatures to kinder actions than were ever painted by mere human fancy for the fabled Arcadia, I &s;hould, perhaps, believe that I was tran&s;ported into fairy land, and
<PB N="326" REF="336">that you and this fair dam&s;el, were the bene|volent Genii; but I had rather do homage to God's own creations than to the be&s;t and brighte&s;t of mere imagination. It is real ex|cellence, real philanthropy, to which I now bow my knee, and before whom I now pour forth my heart." Every one followed the example, and reiterated the effu&s;ion of the holy father.</P>
<P>But, in pure obedience to heaven-taught feelings, the &s;able child of nature, not con|tented with &s;imple kneeling, fell pro&s;trate at Olivia's feet, then pre&s;&s;ed the hem of her gar|ment to his lips, ki&s;&s;ed the &s;acred earth near which &s;he &s;tood, and, indeed, almo&s;t every well remembered object in the chapel-hou&s;e, running rapidly from one to the other. Jane Atwood took the earlie&s;t opportunity to que&s;tion Caroline how &s;he had left her father, then joined the &s;ide of her True George, well &s;atisfied with the information &s;he had received. Charles was wrapt in &s;ilent admi|ration. Arthur now paid his vi&s;it of greet|ing to other objects dear to recollection&mdash; the &s;toried windows, &s;acred figures, &s;culp|tured
<PB N="327" REF="337">effigies of the virgin and the redeemer, and found them all in the mo&s;t perfect pre|&s;ervation&mdash; the emotions of his innocent heart mounted to his eyes as he made this &s;urvey. Flore&s;co accompanied him, and having in|dulged his fir&s;t ungovernable emotions, fol|lowed the lead of his ma&s;ter in &s;imilar &s;ilence, and with &s;imilar feelings&mdash;the words: "Oh, ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour! oh, hallowed Maria! oh, Lord of earth and of heaven! make us worthy of the&s;e thy benignities," were reiterated at almo&s;t every &s;tep.</P>
<P>Meantime, Olivia again &s;truck the harmo|nious chords, and, by an air yet more &s;olemn, carried the &s;oul &s;till nearer to the &s;kies.&mdash; "Lady," ob&s;erved Arthur, "the words of both the &s;trains, with which you have ho|noured us, &s;eem to me well meriting the melody in which you convey them to our hearts." "Ah, they de&s;erve a far better harmoni&s;t, &s;acred &s;ir," an&s;wered Olivia&mdash; "they are the effu&s;ions of my own Henry's mu&s;e: we had always, as you have already heard, our hopes, that you would again take
<PB N="328" REF="338">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this little &s;anctuary, and in our frequent day-dawning or twilight vi&s;itations, we con&s;ulted one another what would find mo&s;t favour with the owners, and what be mo&s;t worthy of the place&mdash;yet they were not con|&s;ultations, holy &s;age, &s;o much as impul&s;es&mdash; we have &s;ometimes dared to think them in|&s;pirations, and in one&mdash;a very&mdash;very recent one;&mdash;of the&s;e, my hu&s;band, at my urgence, wrote for me the beautiful words to which you have done &s;o much ju&s;tice in your appro|bation&mdash;to the&s;e I attempted the imperfect &s;ounds you have honoured with &s;uch wel|come flattery." "If," continued Olivia, with uncommon fervor of air and accent, "if they have the &s;malle&s;t portion of the poet's fire it was reflected from him, and a &s;incere de&s;ire not to di&s;grace the &s;ubject. Methinks there wants but the &s;ociety of the poet to render it one of the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed points of time that ever hath been, or, in|deed, ever can be expected to happen in mortal life!"</P>
<P>Caroline had left Olivia's chair, behind
<PB N="329" REF="339">which &s;he had placed her&s;elf during the air, and had gone &s;omewhat ha&s;tily to another part of the room&mdash;from thence &s;he moved onward till &s;he reached the private door that communicated with the chapel. Over this door was a projecting arch that formed a &s;mall porch, in which two &s;eats were carved, gothic fa&s;hion, in the &s;tone work. She had moved the curtain which was u&s;ually dropt betwixt the <HI>refectoire</HI> and the entrance of the chapel, and, retiring from ob&s;ervation, had at fir&s;t &s;at her&s;elf down in one of the &s;eats.</P>
<P>The enchantments, which Olivia had been &s;preading, caught every ear and every eye, but the in&s;tant &s;he had cea&s;ed to &s;peak &s;he mi&s;&s;ed Caroline, and found her kneeling at the door of the chapel.</P>
<P>"Ah, my &s;weet &s;uppliant," exclaimed Olivia, &s;uppo&s;ing Caroline to have been pray|ing, "doubt not every wi&s;h, every prayer of your pious &s;oul will, in due time, be granted! The whi&s;pering of angels throng|ing about my own &s;oul a&s;&s;ure me it will be &s;o&mdash;but this night mu&s;t be devoted only to fe&s;tal gladne&s;s: the pen&s;ive plea&s;ures will
<PB N="330" REF="340">have their hour: but let not this, I pray you, be one of them."</P>
<P>Olivia looked round her with much &s;olici|tude. Caroline &s;eemed terrified. Olivia ap|peared anxious to &s;ay &s;omething apart to her, but checked her&s;elf. "O! may her every de&s;ire be followed by obedience like mine," &s;ighed Caroline, ri&s;ing with difficulty under Olivia's &s;upport, and rejoining the wondering party. Olivia, wi&s;hing to give Caroline time to recover her&s;elf, prevailed on her friends to partake of her repa&s;t. Caroline found her terrors abate, but continued agitated.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ation is often too mighty for the mere appetites of nature: and, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, the mind a&s;&s;erts its dominion over our bodily frames. The collation was ble&s;&s;ed, admired, and unta&s;ted&mdash;but the health and happine&s;s of the fair foundre&s;s of the banquet, of the bard, and of the har|moni&s;t&mdash; of all within the domains of the ca&s;tle, and the abbey, were propo&s;ed by the grateful monk, and accepted by all, in a gla&s;s of the Burgundy, which Olivia a&s;&s;ured the company, bending over Caroline, was
<PB N="331" REF="341">part of the re&s;erve which had been made for the anniver&s;ary of the day of her own honoured birth&mdash;when the a&s;&s;embled hou&s;es of Fitzorton and Clare, reiterated their bene|diction on Henry and Olivia. "It has ever," Olivia continued, "been &s;acred to ble&s;t events: always con&s;ecrated to love or to friend&s;hip. It marked the day eternally re&s;pected&mdash;that gave me the hand of Henry Fitzorton. It noted the birth of our dear, dear children, and now it is brought forth to di&s;tingui&s;h the re&s;toration of tho&s;e whom Olivia and her Henry, and their excellent brother, mo&s;t honour, and mo&s;t love." When this irre&s;i&s;tible toa&s;t had gone its round, the door of the <HI>refectoire</HI> was opened by John Fitzorton, who, accompanied by Mrs. Herbert and Johanna, came, he &s;aid, "to reclaim his fugitives;" not without excul|patory hints on his own ra&s;hne&s;s, for allow|ing Olivia to engage in &s;uch undertakings, in the immediate &s;tate of her health. Olivia, however, was too &s;ocially happy to have any fears for her&s;elf, and when Johanna
<PB N="332" REF="342">and Mrs. Herbert &s;portingly arraigned her for keeping them out of her plot, &s;he made her peace by an avowal of her &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and a promi&s;e to be more confidential in future. Johanna then conferred with the lieutenant, and the party were, by this addition, yet more intere&s;tingly blended one with the other. Caroline tried hard to rally. At length John intimated the nece&s;|&s;ity of di&s;per&s;ing, and undertook him&s;elf the arrangement of the &s;eparation. To the ladies who had attended him, were united Olivia and Jane Atwood, and with tho&s;e he &s;ought the ca&s;tle, leaving True George, and the apothecary, to e&s;cort back the inhabitants of the abbey. "Ah! father of &s;pirits," &s;ighed Caroline, &s;ecretly, "if in|deed a vi&s;ion, what a &s;hadow was the la&s;t?"</P>

<P>BUT &s;carcely were the colonel and his friends departed, ere father Arthur &s;ugge&s;ted the duty of returning a general thank&s;giving to the Fountain of all Good, in a le&s;s uninterrupted way, and in a yet more holy place&mdash;even in the chapel. Caroline's my&s;tic terrors were re&s;umed, but &s;he &s;till laboured to conceal them.</P>
<P>They all entered the chapel, prayed, and returned into the <HI>refectoire.</HI> Caroline, who had been much di&s;turbed, petitioned &s;trongly for an exclu&s;ive privilege of pa&s;&s;ing a few moments in it alone, and of paying the homage which had been pre&s;&s;ing on her heart, ever &s;ince &s;he had regained her father's hou&s;e, and her father's love. "O! &s;uffer me, holy Director, to offer the devotion of a daughter, to my long-neglected mother's a&s;hes." "Not exclu&s;ively, deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid the lieutenant, "I mu&s;t put in my equal claim." "On this occa&s;ion we mu&s;t all a&s;&s;ert our privilege of pious love," inter|po&s;ed
<PB N="334" REF="344">the monk, "you mu&s;t allow us all to &s;hare with you this tributary offering, my dear child." The plea was too &s;trong to be rejected, and Arthur leading the way, his party followed to the <HI>cemetery</HI> of the Stuarts.</P>
<P>Here too every aweful object di&s;played the &s;ame hand of tender care, which had exerted it&s;elf in the chapel-hou&s;e, and chapel. The lamp which, like the everla&s;ting fire, depended from the centre of the burial place was lighted; and the coffin of lady Matilda was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by an holy taper, placed on a &s;mall pillar of white marble at its head. This having been erected &s;ince their departure, every ob&s;erver felt, at the &s;ight, an aweful curio&s;ity. As they approached nearer to the pillar, they read, engraved on the marble, the&s;e words in honour of the dead:&mdash;'O, till parents, children, and the friends, who &s;hall be found worthy of them, quitting this troubled earth, meet in the heaven of heavens, farewell! farewell!'</P>
<P>The groupe of friends and relatives now
<PB N="335" REF="345">encircled the coffin, and never, perhaps, a&s;cended to that Power, who alone can read the thoughts of mortals, a more &s;incere or fervent offering. Yet Caroline &s;till looked anxiou&s;ly and carefully around, as if in expectation of the vi&s;ion &s;he had alluded to&mdash; but none appeared.</P>
<P>They ro&s;e&mdash;embraced each other&mdash;and returned into the chapel&mdash;Caroline only lingering behind, and begging again a few moments, went back to the remains of her mother.</P>
<P>Her heart was &s;urcharged with &s;trong emotions&mdash;and there &s;he hoped to relieve them.

Ah! endue me, immortal &s;pirit! with a more perfect gratitude, for the varied and unexpected turns of relenting fortune which have of late attended me!&mdash;Enliven my &s;en&s;e of the mighty ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of being re&s;tored to the affections of a parent!&mdash;O! be&s;eech the &s;ource of every good to give thy Caroline a more unmixt &s;en&s;ibility of the benefits &s;he is hourly receiving from the hand of friend|&s;hip &mdash;to make her more truly thankful, for be&s;towing on her the power of returning to this &s;olemn &s;pot, where &s;he &s;eems to commune with the &s;pirit of her angel parent, &mdash;and for being conducted to it, when every fading power of nature warns her &s;he &s;hall &s;hortly fill the &s;pace, even that whereon &s;he now kneels&mdash;long &s;ince fondly appropriated &mdash;be&s;ide her mother's&mdash;her Matilda's a&s;hes."</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="347">As if by this a&s;piration the powers in|voked had li&s;tened to her prayer and &s;uddenly become vi&s;ible, Caroline lifted up her hands towards heaven as &s;he aro&s;e, and gazing earne&s;tly for &s;ome time, &s;pread out her arms as if to receive the de&s;cending object, while a more than human &s;mile pervaded her own countenance. Then continuing her po&s;ition till &s;he &s;eemed to feel &s;trengthened in the conviction, it was permitted the ma|ternal &s;eraph to impart the heavenly pro|mi&s;e to her child: &s;he bowed her head in acknowledgment, and exclaimed with an exulting voice, "Ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;urance! in its faith will I live and die!"</P>
<P>She joined her friends with a mind renewed, and as &s;he returned thanks for their patient attendance, plainly indicated to father Arthur the pious cau&s;e from whence her complacence had been derived. Recovering gradually the tone of her mind, &s;he communicated her acquie&s;cence to the re&s;t. She pre&s;&s;ed them to partake with her of the repa&s;t: a pious &s;erenity of heart was &s;pread from one to the other, and they returned by the arched
<PB N="338" REF="348">pa&s;&s;age to the abbey, without encountering any more impediments, real, or imaginary. "Perhaps then," &s;aid Caroline, &s;oftly to her own heart, "it was but a phantom of my brain." Jonathan who with Jerom had returned from his journey, was waiting at the abbey door eager to inform them, that when they arrived to re&s;ume their ancient po&s;ition in the &s;ick chamber, they found the Baronet in a &s;tate that appeared to them &s;omething wor&s;e than delirious: and in that condition he had left him in the care of his cou&s;in Jerom, while he &s;hould have gone in &s;earch of the apothecary. The latter part of this intelligence was related while the per&s;ons to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed made the utmo&s;t expedition to the Baronet's chamber, where they di&s;covered Jerom and the old nur&s;e, and both the attendants &s;truggling to hold Sir Gui&s;e in their arms.</P>
<P>On the entrance of his friends, Sir Gui&s;e &s;eemed perfectly to di&s;tingui&s;h them, but in vain attempted to &s;peak, and continued to contend with, and almo&s;t break from, the efforts of Jerom, though now a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="339" REF="349">Jonathan. At length he was exhau&s;ted, and then &s;eemed to have gained the point for which he had contended by covering his head in the bed cloaths. They gathered with difficulty from the broken and feeble expre&s;&s;ion of the nur&s;e, that, about an hour after their departure, as &s;he went down &s;tairs at the Baronet's reque&s;t to prepare &s;ome drink for which he was impatient: &s;he only &s;taid about a quarter of an hour while the drink was warming, and on her return up &s;tairs &s;aw the poor gentleman in &s;trong con|vul&s;ions, but why &s;he could not tell.</P>
<P>The &s;oothing attention of his children and their a&s;&s;ociates, each of whom joined their con&s;olements, at length &s;ucceeded in recover|ing the Baronet &s;o far as to expre&s;s his joy in &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>"O! my dear children," exclaimed he, "I thought never to behold you more. The mo&s;t terrible apparitions, if indeed they were not more terrible realities,&mdash;have affrighted&mdash;afflicted me;&mdash;methought they entered my very chamber, approached my bed, threatened me with the mo&s;t agonizing
<PB N="340" REF="350">death, if I uttered a &s;yllable;&mdash;then, me|thought two of them advanced to the head of my bed on each &s;ide, each planting a naked poniard at my throat, if I refu&s;ed their requi&s;itions.&mdash;I was in total darkne&s;s, but methought, one &s;aid to the other, we may go &s;afely into Caroline's room: we know &s;he is from home. I &s;aw her"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Saw her!" exclaimed Arthur, looking at his friends.</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, "and there|fore they &s;wore it was the time mo&s;t fit|ting." &mdash;"Fitting for what?" demanded Charles.&mdash;"I know not," an&s;wered the Baronet, "but I was, methought, preparing to make &s;ome an&s;wer, when, thank heaven! the two young men with the other attendant you have provided me, came to my &s;uccour. I mu&s;t confe&s;s," added Sir Gui&s;e, "my thoughts had been heavily wandering; it is certain there was no appearance of any body afterwards."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure," &s;aid Jonathan, "his honour was &s;o di&s;tracted mad with fright, that we had all enough to do to look after
<PB N="341" REF="351">him: &s;o that fifty men, or devils, either, might be in the hou&s;e, and we never the wi&s;er; but when I went down &s;tairs and waited ever &s;o long for your honour, I peeked and pottered about the premi&s;es, but &s;aw never a living &s;oul but little old Fitz, who had taken it into his head to come after me."</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the company confirming this, it was conjectured the Baronet had been actually wrought upon, either by a di&s;tem|pered fancy, a fre&s;h attack of his remor&s;eful feelings, or a di&s;ordered &s;leep interrupted by horrid vi&s;ions. Indeed, his weak &s;tate of body, and nerves, and his habitual fearful|ne&s;s, which had &s;till its degree of force, though his mind had of late known an unu&s;ual energy, &s;eemed to give a colour to this &s;up|po&s;ition. The apothecary declared it was phy&s;ically po&s;&s;ible. "As to that," &s;aid Jerom, "don't you remember, cou&s;in Jonathan, when you were one night in the clutches of the night-mare, that you cried out, the furies were hunting you with red|hot-pokers! and, as the pe&s;t would have it,
<PB N="342" REF="352">I was your bed-fellow at that time, and a fine time I had of it; and by the &s;ame token, you gave me &s;uch <HI>kelps</HI> in the &s;tomach, &s;wearing you had hold of one of 'em how|&s;omdever, and would make him pay for the re&s;t.&mdash;Yes, your honours, he took his own innocent cou&s;in for one of the devils that had got into 'un, and &s;o, no wonder Sir Gui&s;e &s;hould think he &s;aw the incarnates who u&s;ed to haunt him, which is natural;&mdash; poor gentleman, he has been hag-ridden long enough broad awake, and has at la&s;t dreamt about it."</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks, with a quaint joke or two from the apothecary, threw over the &s;o|lemnity of the circum&s;tance a ludicrous air, which the apothecary and Arthur thought it be&s;t to encourage, and &s;o well carried on, that Sir Gui&s;e him&s;elf, in the end &s;miled at his own chimera: the &s;ubject was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by George, declaring, that he had heard much of &s;uch devil's works, and believed he had in his time &s;een &s;ome of them: but that he was very &s;ure if all the imps below, with the old one at the
<PB N="343" REF="353">head of them, were to appear before a per&s;on who was re&s;olved to be good, and with the grace of God upon him, he might be ju&s;t as &s;afe among&s;t them, as if they were &s;o many kittens." Jonathan and Jerom, however, for the baronet's more entire &s;atis|faction, determined both to be his life-body|guards the en&s;uing night; and Flore&s;co promi&s;ed to &s;it open-eyed on the out&s;ide of his ma&s;ter Arthur's door, to give notice if any body approached; "Ickle Florrey u&s;ed to be fright at every thing," &s;aid he, "but now only fraid of God." True George and the apothecary now went to their re&s;pective re&s;idences; the lieutenant and Caroline with|drew to their chambers, but not till the latter had tenderly a&s;&s;ured her father &s;he could an&s;wer for the interce&s;&s;ion of his wife being added to that of his friends and children for every good that mortal could enjoy in this world, and angel in the next.</P>
<P>It is however, to be noted, that although none of the abbey party which had returned from the chapel-hou&s;e, made mention to Sir Gui&s;e of any of the &s;trange appearances
<PB N="344" REF="354">they had &s;een or heard in their way thither; nor, indeed, had alluded to any &s;uch fancies or facts to any of their friends of Fitzorton ca&s;tle; being, on the one hand, afraid of increa&s;ing the alarm of the baronet, and on the other, too much wrought upon by the impre&s;&s;ive realities which awaited them in the chapel-hou&s;e: the circum&s;tances could not but recur to them, while that unhappy invalid was de&s;cribing their dreadful influ|ence on his mind and imagination; nor could the whole party help thinking there was a &s;trange yet incongruous analogy betwixt what they had them&s;elves &s;een, and what Sir Gui&s;e had related: and thus, while they imputed much of the overcharged colourings, and con&s;cious per&s;onifications of the one, to a di&s;tempered mind and body, they con|cluded there was more &s;ub&s;tance than &s;hadow in what had a&s;&s;ailed their own eyes and ears.</P>
<P>And in this deduction they were not a little confirmed by the report of the apothe|cary, as they were &s;eparating. "Had not one of the &s;ingular &s;ights, we have &s;een,
<PB N="345" REF="355">put a &s;udden &s;top to my di&s;cour&s;e," &s;aid this worthy man, "I was going to inform you, what I had, indeed, before mentioned to colonel Fitzorton, that notwith&s;tanding all that gentleman's precaution, and my own, to have it &s;uppo&s;ed I was in expectation of more patients, as well as &s;ome kinsfolk of the &s;ick quaker; and although your journey hither was performed with the utmo&s;t pri|vacy, and you arrived at the dead of the night, a very general curio&s;ity, concerning you, had been excited in the neighbourhood. The waggons too, and the appearance of Robert Irwin, and a more frequent re&s;ort to, and return from, the abbey, in the Fitzorton family, particularly the vi&s;its of Olivia, which could not be altogether private, much increa&s;ed the ma&s;s of wild conjecture, which flew from one village to the other. Yet the &s;uper&s;tition of the villagers, covered every thing &s;oon after. Tribes of gyp&s;ies who, as you mu&s;t remember, u&s;ually inhabited the fore&s;t, di&s;appeared &s;oon after their benefactors left the abbey; but of late a new &s;et has been ob&s;erved to lurk about the woods, and
<PB N="346" REF="356">hover near the hou&s;e. Nay &s;ome have, as the report goes, been &s;een to come out of it. Now it &s;trikes me, that the figures we &s;aw moving, about our underground path, were &s;ome of tho&s;e very gyp&s;ies, who may there, occa&s;ionally, take up their lodging, and who were po&s;&s;ibly more alarmed at us than we at them." Caroline &s;hook her head and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;igh.</P>
<P>Arthur inclined to Burton's opinion. The lieutenant &s;aid, "it was more probable that &s;ome of the friendly party at the ca&s;tle, had included tho&s;e &s;eeming apparitions in the general magic of the evening, but rather did not chu&s;e, or forgot, to mention it." "But then," &s;aid Caroline, "how are we to account for my dear father's terrors hap|pening on the &s;ame evening? And almo&s;t at the &s;ame period? And the dreadful word, murder! None of the friends at the ca&s;tle would extend the &s;pirit of a fearful frolic to the &s;ick chamber of him they now &s;uc|cour and protect. On the contrary, they would rather carry into it every amicable and &s;oothing gue&s;t. No &s;pirit of darkne&s;s
<PB N="347" REF="357">could, even in mockery, proceed from them. Doubtle&s;s fancy may greatly deceive by her illu&s;ive creations. Methought I my&s;elf, very lately, &s;aw a &s;pirit of light&mdash;but, alas! it &s;oon flitted away."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now the time for us to explain alarms and appearances, of a different na|ture, which happened, about the &s;ame cri&s;is, at the ca&s;tle, and with which &s;ome of tho&s;e at the abbey are materially connected. When colonel Fitzorton was returning home with Olivia, from her interview with Caroline, thereby breaking up a very intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation, he was extremely thoughtful and &s;poke little; but on gaining the ca&s;tle he informed his fair &s;i&s;ter-in-law, who was always terrified at the &s;ilence of John, that he had received accounts from Partington, by expre&s;s, intimating Henry's re&s;olve to return. When they got into the library, Partington writes thus, &s;aid John, pre&s;enting the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="348" REF="358">
<P>Our impracticable caitiff re&s;i&s;ts all autho|rity. He even mocks at oaths, though I have fulminated at him like an anathema|ti&s;ing pope. But the villain is head&s;trong, a bull of Ba&s;an could not &s;top him. I threaten to put him in double irons&mdash;but he is wife-&s;ick, and whimpers like a great boy to go home. As 'tis plain that our little fair-faced incorrigible Olivia, alone can &s;top his career, I &s;end to de&s;ire &s;he will pronounce &s;entence of obedience and ab&s;ence upon him, for another week or &s;o, as I expect my brother, the doctor, from the Ea&s;t, and have &s;et my heart on his &s;taying to greet him.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Mo&s;t in&s;ufferable, I remain your friend.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"Well," exclaimed Olivia, as &s;he returned the letter, "why may he not return? You mu&s;t own I have been all patience and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. But &s;urely you have apprehended, though from the kinde&s;t motive, more than was nece&s;&s;ary. For my part, as Sir Gui&s;e is &s;o much better, and both his children
<PB N="349" REF="359">among&s;t his nur&s;es, I think the &s;ight of a bo&s;om friend, and of my &s;weet Caroline, mu&s;t be what Henry's heart could mo&s;t wi&s;h, and I augur from it every good to his health, as well as happine&s;s." "And I every ill," an&s;wered John. "I know his nature, and its limit of bearing &s;uddenly any exce&s;s, either of joy or &s;orrow. Grant me another week, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, and if at the end of that term&mdash;" "I yield up," interrupted Olivia, "wholly, my judgment to yours. It &s;hall be &s;o, and I will, though it feels very unnatural, i&s;&s;ue &s;uch mandates as you think nece&s;&s;ary, to keep far from me him, who&s;e pre&s;ence is the &s;upreme joy of my life." "Long may he remain &s;o!" cried John, very tenderly. It is only that his joy may be &s;ecured to him for years, that I deprive him of hours and days." Olivia's eyes &s;hone with grateful tears, and begging pardon for her impatience, marked with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive hand, the &s;entiments which the colonel dictated: he added &s;ome rea&s;ons of his own, confided in a &s;eparate letter to Partington, and the expre&s;s &s;et off. Olivia
<PB N="350" REF="360">then related a plan &s;he had &s;ketched, in concert with Jane Atwood, to make the good Arthur's return to his beloved chapel-hou&s;e, and perhaps that of Charles and their favourite Caroline, a little more fitted for their reception. "Now as all this is &s;ettled in our own minds as to what is to be done, and, indeed, almo&s;t every thing prepared, I do not a&s;k you to take any active part on the occa&s;ion, my dear colonel, but as you know, I can fancy no undertaking of mine, however trifling, goes on well, or as it &s;hould do, till it has your &s;anction on it&mdash;next to the ble&s;&s;ing of my beloved hu&s;band, and my God&mdash; and as you have thought fit to deprive me of my Henry's council, and James is ab&s;ent, you mu&s;t be their repre&s;entative to throw out &s;uch a lure as the party may not be able to re&s;i&s;t." She recapitulated all &s;he had done to obey John, and expected a reward.</P>
<P>John Fitzorton was not the man, with all the a&s;perity we have &s;een on the &s;urface of his character, to refu&s;e virtue its recom|pence; or to chill the &s;pirit of benevolence by a frown. He &s;miled a&s;&s;ent; offered every
<PB N="351" REF="361">a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the apothecary coming to the ca&s;tle, with &s;ome good tidings from the abbey, it was re&s;olved <HI>nem. con.</HI> after he and True George, the ready auxiliary of every good, to call in the two la&s;t mentioned per&s;onages as a&s;&s;i&s;tants. A few more words pa&s;t, as to the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, and the couriers &s;et off. Their conduct on arrival has been already related. But the events that, in the intermediate time, took place at the ca&s;tle are yet to be told.</P>
<P>"When our little project has &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to bring the party together," &s;aid Olivia to John, "and they are all as happy as I &s;incerely hope the arrangement will make them, you can bring dear Johanna and Mrs. Herbert to &s;ee the effect. And thus every thing will be right but the ab&s;ence of our Henry: for after all, it mu&s;t be allowed that, no man living&mdash;no, nor woman either&mdash; could give &s;o much grace and &s;weetne&s;s to a plot of this kind, the &s;ole point of which is to &s;often for a moment, the wounds of the unfortunate and good."</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="362">Scarcely had her ever faithful heart poured forth, audibly and ardently, this tributary effu&s;ion to its fir&s;t and deare&s;t object, ere that object made his appearance. He had been, for &s;ome time, in a cabinet adjoining Olivia's, the library where &s;he and his bro|ther had been conver&s;ing, and of that con|ver&s;ation every &s;yllable had met his a&s;to|ni&s;hed ear; for although the door that communicated with the library was &s;hut, a &s;mall window, which looked into it was open, and only a thin &s;ilk curtain parted the &s;peakers from the hearer. The latter had, indeed, entered the cabinet very &s;oon after the former by another, and, indeed, the u&s;ual door that opened into the library. Henry had, moreover, met the expre&s;s, ju&s;t as he entered the park, received his own letter, and under&s;tood from the courier that John and Olivia were both well, and, indeed, when he was called into the library, to receive his commands, "their honours &s;eemed main merry." As Henry, therefore, met no body either in the &s;tables, or court yard,
<PB N="353" REF="363">but &s;uch &s;ervants as were immediately em|ployed there, he pa&s;t directly from thence into the hou&s;e, and gained the &s;uite of apart|ments that communicated with the library, without being ob&s;erved by any of the family. Not, however, as the reader who has long been intimate with all his feelings, and all his merits, will ea&s;ily believe, with de&s;ign to &s;teal any intelligence, or purloin any &s;ecret by that ignominious method many hu&s;bands, and, perchance, &s;ome wives al&s;o, have thought a fair accommodation betwixt con|&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s and convenience to adopt; but purely to give his return all the plea&s;ure his generous nature would wi&s;h to impart. Hap|pening, however, to gain his &s;tation in the cabinet ju&s;t as his wife began to read Parting|ton's letter a &s;econd time, and aloud, with the ludicrous &s;pirit in which it was written, he &s;at him&s;elf down quietly to hear him&s;elf abu&s;ed; but, &s;oon finding there was going to be formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, he thought it but fair to fortify him&s;elf with as much of his <HI>friendly enemies'</HI> de&s;ign as he could. Yet their de&s;igns were woven with
<PB N="354" REF="364">&s;o many other plots of infinite concern to his feelings, that he was bound to the &s;pot by &s;pells more potent than any the con&s;pira|tors were preparing to throw within the chapel-hou&s;e, or, indeed, any which had vi&s;ited, in their mo&s;t my&s;tic &s;hapes, either the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, or the abbey. Every &s;yllable that reached his ear, and not one could e&s;cape, went immediately to his a&s;to|ni&s;hed heart, and the whole formed a chain of wonders and of miracles, that nothing but the voice of the guilele&s;s being that revealed them, or that of God him&s;elf, could have made him credit.</P>
<P>Irre&s;olute what cour&s;e to take, he remained awhile concealed, after his Olivia had te&s;tified her eternal &s;en&s;ibility of his merit ab&s;ent as pre&s;ent; but that fre&s;h evidence of her gene|rous love called forth a grateful repetition of his vows to live only for her, and with this a&s;&s;urance he opened the library door, and notwith&s;tanding all he had heard ran into her arms. There, to the di&s;may of his brother, and to the delight of his wife, he &s;aid, that he felt him&s;elf &s;o unju&s;t, unkind, wicked, to
<PB N="355" REF="365">be wandering from home when his Olivia was in circum&s;tances that a&s;ked for the care of ALL her friends, that he traver&s;ed the wiles of his dear abu&s;ive Partington to detain him, left the Bury in an adventurous manner in the middle of the night, and left little Caroline in pledge, and a note to &s;ay, "if his friend had not had enough of him, he mu&s;t follow to the abbey." The inexpre&s;&s;i|ble &s;weetne&s;s with which Mrs. Fitzorton re|ceived the&s;e kind motives of the run-a-way; the fondling of little John who-&s;oon came into the room, with the animated tokens of good will that &s;at on the face of every do|me&s;tick, when the my&s;tery of his fir&s;t entry was removed by Olivia's ringing for &s;ome refre&s;hments, and the cordial welcome of John, who, in the mid&s;t of all his embar|ra&s;&s;ments at this &s;udden event, was rejoiced to &s;ee the marks of &s;o tender a meeting, gave to Henry's &s;alutations a more than u&s;ual energy. He felt him&s;elf able to &s;peak of the plots upon him, and to explain the fair &s;tratagems always taken in wars, by which he had di&s;covered them. But when he pro|ceeded
<PB N="356" REF="366">to &s;hew that &s;uch di&s;covery went to ALL the family &s;ecrets they were carrying on at the ca&s;tle, the chapel-hou&s;e, and the abbey, and in dilating all this, that the &s;ame, or rather a more redundant, and unob&s;tructed flow of &s;pirit and expre&s;&s;ion, animated him, to the infinite bli&s;s of Olivia, who conceived it very naturally to be the effect of the &s;everal cau&s;es of her own happine&s;s, from the penitence of Sir Gui&s;e, the re&s;toration of the &s;on and daughter, his olde&s;t friends, the joy of which &s;he had &s;o long wi&s;hed him to partake&mdash;the fears even of the Colonel were, perhaps, for the fir&s;t time, extingui&s;hed by &s;ome bright hopes, that, at length, the reconciling affec|tion of the wife had emancipated the very heart of Henry from all former &s;lavery, as effectually as a newer mi&s;tre&s;s had obtained the freedom, or rather a more lawful capti|vity, for the heart of Charles.</P>
<P>"There can now then be no earthly ob|jection," cried Olivia, "to your brother's taking an active part in our darling plan, my dear Colonel. Nay no philo&s;ophy&mdash;I want poetry, and &s;ong, and mu&s;ic, and all manner
<PB N="357" REF="367">of things from earth and heaven. O, Henry! you could not have come back at a moment in which you and your mu&s;e, were &s;o much wanted. I have myriads of things to tell you&mdash;a long, long, hi&s;tory of all that belongs to the dear per&s;ons who are now among&s;t us, and you &s;hall have it all before we go, but at pre&s;ent Jane and I mu&s;t be&s;tir our|&s;elves, for we have yet &s;omething to do towards our little f&ecirc;te&mdash;I have al&s;o to pre&s;ent &s;ome new friends to you here at the ca&s;tle&mdash; but we will not &s;ay a word to your old ones at the abbey about your return till the exact moment."</P>
<P>Imagining &s;he, &s;aw negatives begin to cloud John's before a&s;&s;enting face, &s;he caught the hand of her &s;on, and Jane Atwood, and left the library.</P>

<P>HENRY and John Fitzorton, were now brought together in the mo&s;t critical period of their dome&s;tick hi&s;tory&mdash;and it was not till after they found they were thus by them&s;elves
<PB N="358" REF="368">that they became fully &s;en&s;ible of it: yet the ardour of the former, in a great degree, &s;till marked his language and his look, and a &s;en|timent that ble&s;&s;ed the innocence, and un|&s;u&s;picious goodne&s;s of Olivia followed the parting &s;teps of his wife. "And thanks to heaven, and to you, &s;he is as happy as &s;he is good," ob&s;erved John. "My dear, dear, brother," cried Henry, &s;miling in tears, "to heaven, and to you would have been truer language&mdash;Let us&mdash;let us&mdash;conver&s;e a little on the almo&s;t incredible events which lead to what I have ju&s;t heard. Give them to me naturally and &s;imply; ju&s;t as they have been; ju&s;t as they are." John managed this requi|&s;ition with admirable addre&s;s; he pa&s;&s;ed lightly over &s;uch parts as would, he knew, have too much intere&s;ted his brother's feel|ings, and detailed, at length, whatever was likely to give energy, or example, to his mind. At the &s;ame time there were few inci|dents of importance with which he did not make him acquainted, &s;o far as re&s;pected the penitence of Sir Gui&s;e, and the amiable con|duct of his &s;on and daughter, in their rela|tive
<PB N="359" REF="369">characters, as children, and in all other particulars. He took blame on him&s;elf for excluding his brothers from the plea&s;ure he was con&s;cious they would have had in join|ing him, in his &s;everal plans, for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of tho&s;e who were certainly no le&s;s objects of pure love and care to them than to him&s;elf: but that, in truth, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as performing the part of guardian for the general good, and in that character thought it would turn out mo&s;t for the advan|tage of his wards to keep them out of the trouble of very difficult and perplexed affairs, till he could &s;ee how far it would be po&s;&s;ible to clear off incumbrances, and deferred lay|ing before them the hi&s;tory of his tru&s;tee&s;hip for their real felicity, till he could deliver with it a correct e&s;timate of what, in &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they were worth. But &s;ince it had turned out, that their worth in the tried virtue of &s;ome of their deare&s;t friends, in the corrected vices of one of their foule&s;t enemies, and above all in the daily, hourly, proof of the love of a &s;i&s;ter and a wife, beyond all price, he hoped he &s;hould be
<PB N="360" REF="370">pardoned. He thence took occa&s;ion to en|large more particularly on the behaviour, and tranfactions of Olivia, as connected with his own in the affairs of the abbey. He &s;hewed her commi&s;eration for the &s;uffering wicked, her honour of the good, her friend&s;hip for the friends of Henry, her forgivene&s;s even of his foes, when they repented them of their enmity, and her love of Henry&mdash;a love, &s;aid he, pure and permanent, blended with every thought, wove into every action, mixed with every object, and joined with almo&s;t every word. In &s;hort, a purer, or more eloquent, appeal for penitent vice&mdash;a more generous offering to per&s;evering virtue, or a more honourable di&s;charge of fraternal duty, amid&s;t private heartfelt di&s;appointments, has rarely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed that which was then paid by John Fitzorton.</P>
<P>Henry Fitzorton had a &s;oul to feel it. He felt it, indeed, in all points but the one which gave lu&s;tre to the re&s;t. Of many touching, and trying features in the character and conduct of his brother, Henry was &s;till ignorant: yet he knew enough to be con|vinced
<PB N="361" REF="371">John Fitzorton was to be ranked among&s;t the fir&s;t of wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and honour|able men, and that to him he &s;tood indebted for the neare&s;t and deare&s;t obligations: and in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, he felt mo&s;t pro|foundly the generous principles on which he had acted, and &s;aw clearly into the motives from which he had &s;poken; and when the narrative clo&s;ed with the eulogy of Olivia, although by a thou&s;and &s;ilent emotions he re&s;ponded to all the preceding particulars, he drew the eulogi&s;t to his bo&s;om with a fervor that after a thrice repeated embrace he dropt from the arms of a brother on his knees to God&mdash;"It is thou, thou only mu&s;t I &s;upplicate, O fountain of all power, to make me more worthy of &s;uch friends&mdash;of &s;uch a brother&mdash;of &s;uch a wife! on each, on all be thy everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;ing!"</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t Henry," &s;aid John, while he rai&s;ed him, "I am beyond all payment in your debt: your conduct is at once my re|buke and my glory. In&s;tead of winding my way from one my&s;tic path to another, with a
<PB N="362" REF="372">caution that might &s;eem leading to the haunts of infamy, rather than to the rece&s;&s;es of innocence, and really trembling from fear of di&s;covery at every opening of my laby|rinths, as much as if I were actually carrying on a plan of fraud, I might have gone on in the &s;traight and direct line of amity and con|fidence, and gained from your copartner&s;hip the &s;ame end, by more expeditious and ea&s;y means. The apology, therefore, that I have already found it nece&s;&s;ary to make to Charles Stuart, I now repeat to Henry Fitz|orton &mdash;for every plea&s;ure your Olivia would have &s;hared with you on the points I have conducted, have been withheld from you by me, and I was even in the act of projecting new concealments, in order to keep you"&mdash; "From old misfortunes," interpo&s;ed Henry.</P>
<P>"It remains with you," re&s;umed John, "to act as your judgment may decide, as to the immediate &s;cheme at the chapel-hou&s;e. It is too late to recal the invitation, and if it were not, there could no &s;trong rea&s;on be given for the cruelty of with-holding the
<PB N="363" REF="373">pious father Arthur from his offerings in the little temple, which his poor heart has con|&s;ecrated; nor for checking Olivia in the glowing career of what <HI>her</HI> poor heart has projected. I think it, however, likely that &s;ome of the abbey family will remain with Sir Gui&s;e, and a ready rea&s;on to be given for your declining to go is"&mdash;"Brother," interpo&s;ed Henry, "I am rejoiced, though &s;urpri&s;ed at my dear Charles's transfer; yet on that &s;ubject there is much to be &s;aid. The transfer to the &s;econd was made in a long ab&s;ence from the fir&s;t object."&mdash; "There, to be &s;ure," an&s;wered John, inter|&s;ecting the di&s;cour&s;e,&mdash;"both you and he have had an advantage over&mdash;over&mdash;many others." The words, 'many others,' were &s;ub&s;tituted for a name that hung trembling on the verge of the &s;peaker's lips. "Ah, my deare&s;t John," ob&s;erved Henry, "had my friend, the lieutenant, been expo&s;ed to the temptation of &s;eeing before his eyes the &s;cenes of his former pa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;had he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed only the faintly imitated, the inanimate likene&s;s of the features that fir&s;t won his
<PB N="364" REF="374">heart"&mdash;"Brother Henry," an&s;wered John, "it is very po&s;&s;ible&mdash;I&mdash;know it is&mdash;a&mdash;a friend of mine was&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;once in a &s;ituation of that &s;ort&mdash;I&mdash;therefore know it is very po&s;&s;ible&mdash;to be in the almo&s;t con&s;tant habit of &s;eeing, and &s;peaking to the originals of &s;uch pictures&mdash;and whether the affections were transferrable or not&mdash;I am certain he never harboured a thought that"&mdash;The ha&s;ty, and lucky entrance of Olivia put a &s;top to John's ob&s;ervations. She came to relate the farther progre&s;s &s;he had made in her project&mdash;but added, &s;he had in&s;tant em|ployment for the mu&s;e of her darling Henry. The reader already knows the nature of that employment&mdash;and ju&s;t as &s;he had placed be|fore him, pen, ink, and paper, and had whi&s;pered the &s;ubjects, de&s;iring John would go down &s;tairs with her, and leave the bard to the in&s;piration of friend&s;hip, Mr. Parting|ton, preceded by a volley of accu&s;ations, &s;et forth in his mo&s;t vehement &s;tyle, bur&s;t into the room, calling out, "An e&s;cape, an e&s;cape! the caitiff has robbed, and plun|dered
<PB N="365" REF="375">me of my trea&s;ure&mdash;taken out of my hou&s;e a thing I cho&s;e to &s;et a value on&mdash;his abominable &s;elf, and tho&s;e who harbour him are as bad as him&s;elf." "My dear railer," &s;aid the colonel, jocularly, "I am afraid I &s;hall be henceforth entitled to your polite|ne&s;s, for I have led you, among&s;t many others, into the&s;e &s;trange round-about mi&s;|takes." John then entered into &s;ome partial explanations, after which, taking the &s;quire by the hand, he exclaimed, "And now, my good friend, if you will accompany me into the &s;hrubbery, and grant half an hour's pa|tience, I will relate to you the re&s;t." Par|tington ea&s;ily &s;aw he had heard as much as could &s;afely be confided in the pre&s;ence of Olivia, and went out with the colonel, ob|&s;erving, as he took off his hat with unu&s;ual civility&mdash;"yes, I begin to think you are one of my worthy gentlemen!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN John Fitzorton had told his friend Partington all that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know, he introduced that gentleman to his <HI>protegees,</HI> Mrs. Herbert, and his Jo|hanna, a&s;&s;uring him they were candidates for his mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed incivility, and that they were as likely as any women he knew to de&s;erve it. "O, I have not the lea&s;t doubt," an&s;wered Partingron, when he was fir&s;t pre&s;ented,&mdash;"but I &s;hall be obliged to &s;et them down in my li&s;t of abominables: I &s;ee it in both their faces." "Indeed, &s;ir," &s;aid Johanna, trembling, betwixt fear and hope, "you cannot think how unea&s;y I have been le&s;t you &s;hould take it into your fancy to be polite to me." "And for my part," ob&s;erved Mrs. Herbert, "I &s;hould look on my&s;elf as a lo&s;t woman were you to pay me a compliment, or make me a bow." Par|tington had long &s;ince heard their general, and &s;ome of their particular misfortunes;
<PB N="367" REF="377">and therefore, though he never &s;aw either of them before, he clapped on his hat, which, in truth, &s;eldom quitted his head, but to ex|pre&s;s his aver&s;ion, and walked off with them into the library, arm in arm, abu&s;ing them all the way, as an earne&s;t of what might far|ther be expected. The colonel followed, and &s;eeing the cabinet door open, they &s;top|ped there.</P>
<P>Henry was &s;itting at his de&s;k with the pen &s;till in his hand, Olivia leaning over, and &s;uiting what he had written to her guitar, alternately running to another part of the library, to try it on her harp.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" whi&s;pered Partington, "we mu&s;t not di&s;turb the ra&s;cals, I &s;uppo&s;e, while they are in that &s;ort of mad fit."</P>
<P>The poet and mu&s;ician proceeded in a &s;ubject that touched every chord of their hearts; perhaps neither of them heard the ob&s;ervations, or &s;aw the ob&s;ervers; yet tears, which by the po&s;ition he who &s;hed them concealed from Olivia, filled the eyes of Henry, and were not ea&s;ily prevented from dropping on the lines he had compo&s;ed:
<PB N="368" REF="378">&s;imilar drops &s;uffu&s;ed the lovely face, and trembled in the voice of Olivia as &s;he adapted them to &s;pontaneous harmony: the genuine poe&s;y of nature animated by the mu&s;ic of a benevolent heart. Olivia, with diffident &s;weetne&s;s, propo&s;ed the adoption of an epi|thet in one of the ver&s;es, as more au&s;picious to &s;ound, but feared the &s;en&s;e would be in|jured: the &s;ound was her own, the &s;en&s;e Henry's; Henry &s;ub&s;tituted, and confe&s;&s;ed the &s;en&s;e was much improved. To the bloom in Olivia's cheek on this compliment, there is no de&s;cription. It was the bloom of gratitude and love. Who can paint it? Henry, in turn, improving on him&s;elf, al|tered a thought, and gave it poetic expre&s;|&s;ion. It occa&s;ioned the change of a whole di&s;tich, and its aim was to prove that the recovery of a lo&s;t trea&s;ure was a richer po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion than if we had never been bereaved. "O, heaven! what an idea," exclaimed his wife, "and &s;o it is&mdash;you mean the recovery of the little chapel-hou&s;e&mdash;the trea&s;ure of Arthur's heart&mdash;it extends al&s;o to the cha|pel it&s;elf, and what is yet more &s;acred, to
<PB N="369" REF="379">the &s;olemn burial-place of the Stuarts&mdash;the trea&s;ure of our Caroline's heart&mdash;Ah, how &s;hall I give &s;ound to this? help, help your de&s;pairing Olivia, my dear, dear Henry: let the poet in&s;pire the mu&s;ician; or, O, ra|ther, let the fountain of every pure and bounteous idea who be&s;towed the thought, a&s;&s;i&s;t its melody: it de&s;erves the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres, and to be &s;ung by its angels."</P>
<P>"Then it &s;hould be &s;ung by Olivia," ex|claimed Henry, ri&s;ing from his chair, and folding her with enthu&s;ia&s;m: "none but an angelic nature can, &s;urely, attribute to every thought, and word, and deed, the be&s;t and pure&s;t motive. By Providence, I &s;wear, every moment of my life convinces me that I can never, never merit thee." "Not merit! O, ingrate to that Providence," an|&s;wered Olivia, "you merit every thing that is good."</P>
<P>The clo&s;eted auditory now came from their rece&s;s. They advanced even to Olivia's harp without &s;peaking, or being &s;poken to. John had been weeping, and was &s;till extremely &s;oft|ened; O, thought he, can it be in nature that
<PB N="370" REF="380">Olivia &s;hould love more tenderly than &s;he is beloved!&mdash;Mrs. Herbert's bo&s;om throbbed at the remembrance of recollected happi|ne&s;s&mdash;her eye in&s;en&s;ibly turned on John; but &s;he &s;uffered it not to tarry. Johanna, almo&s;t &s;hrinking from her&s;elf, timidly &s;ighed to her own heart as &s;he approached Olivia, "Ah! Charles, Charles! how can&s;t thou ever fancy any re&s;emblance betwixt thy poor Johanna and Olivia?" Partington had &s;truggled be|twixt his nature and his habits a con&s;iderable time; and as the one or the other obtained the ma&s;tery, he was now ready with an eja|culation of unmixed tenderne&s;s, or began a ble&s;&s;ing with its inver&s;ing accompanyments&mdash; at length, he got &s;ufficiently into his old hu|mour to exclaim, as he took the hands of Olivia and Henry,&mdash;"I can only &s;ay, that if you do not quite murder me before I get back, I will here grant an act of oblivion to all the abominations that are pa&s;t." Parting|ton demanded a &s;hare in Olivia's plot&mdash; "Unle&s;s," &s;aid John, looking &s;ignificantly at Henry, "you think it be&s;t that you and Partington &s;hould &s;tay and abu&s;e one another
<PB N="371" REF="381">comfortably at home." "Mo&s;t readily," an&s;wered Henry, with generous earne&s;tne&s;s &mdash;"our little gratulatory offerings are ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and then&mdash;" "What! not go to &s;ee and hear the effect of your &s;weet ode, and beautiful hymn?"&mdash;"My brother," &s;aid John, "may be fatigued after his journey, and with his unexpected flight to Parna&s;&s;us: the air for odes, you know, is very far, in|deed, up the poetic mountain, &s;i&s;ter." "And hymns, I &s;hould think," ob&s;erved Parting|ton, "being heavenly, can blow only from the &s;ummit;&mdash;Is'n't it &s;o, you clambering cai|tiff?" "Fatigued!" cried Olivia, re&s;pond|ing to the humour, "O! how little do phi|lo&s;ophers and gentlemen farmers know the unwearied &s;pirit which poe&s;y in&s;pires!&mdash;But I feel the rea&s;on that induces the bard to de|cline honouring us with his company. He is a&s;hamed of his mu&s;ician."&mdash;"A&s;hamed of her!" ejaculated Henry,&mdash;"I would &s;hew her, with pride, to the ho&s;t of heaven!" "I am &s;en&s;ible," re&s;umed Olivia, "that &s;he has by no means done him ju&s;tice&mdash;but, on a meeting of &s;o many dear and unexpected
<PB N="372" REF="382">friends&mdash;methinks, I beg pardon.&mdash;I dare &s;ay, you are all right&mdash;but I had &s;o &s;et my heart on his pre&s;ence&mdash;the very laurel&mdash;yea, the crown of my poor little project, el&s;e, I hope, I &s;hould not have been quite &s;o unrea&s;onable."</P>
<P>And then, perhaps, for the fir&s;t time, in all the years of their&mdash;to her, ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;to him, alas! unhappy marriage! Olivia Fitz|orton dropped on her hu&s;band's hand, which &s;he held to her lips, a tear of di&s;appointment, and Henry was the innocent cau&s;e!&mdash;"Go, brother," whi&s;pered John. "O! ever dear, too tender and too good," cried Henry, "I thought Mr. Partington might want com|pany&mdash; I thought that my &s;udden, and un|expected appearance might, perhaps, in a manner, derange the plan."&mdash;"Or, per|chance," cried Olivia, correcting her&s;elf, "might alarm our beloved friends&mdash;Caro|line is, indeed, much out of health; and her &s;pirits have &s;uffered. You will hardly know her, Henry, I am a&s;hamed not to have thought of this&mdash;forgive my precipitance. It would be wrong&mdash;Yes, I &s;ee it would." At the&s;e words &s;he walked backwards and
<PB N="373" REF="383">forwards in the room, by which &s;he relieved not only her&s;elf but the re&s;t of the company. John's hopes revived, as to Henry's remain|ing at home, and he was collecting arguments and rea&s;ons as to the propriety of that mea|&s;ure, on the ground of Olivia's own re|marks; and Partington was gathering toge|ther a round of &s;currilities to back the colonel; while Henry, with very worthy feelings, &s;at down to the vain attempt of fini&s;hing his poetry&mdash;In the mid&s;t, however, of his employment, which, alas! was rather that of making long, crooked marks, than legible words, he &s;aid to John&mdash;&s;till mark|ing, and the tones of his voice as irregular as the &s;trokes of his pen&mdash;"He hoped Caro|line Stuart was not very ill&mdash;not&mdash;not&mdash;not in any danger?" This was the only time he had mentioned her name to his brother, or any of his friends, or even given an allu&s;ion to it, except when his wife's conver&s;ation made it inevitable, &s;ince the time he inti|mated a wi&s;h, &s;anctioned by Olivia, to have &s;ome of the abbey furniture bought in for the former owners, and even then it was
<PB N="374" REF="384">by letter. John making, therefore, full allowance for a que&s;tion, which tender friend|&s;hip &s;trictly warranted, he pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Henry mo&s;t affectionately, and returned in whi&s;pers a con&s;oling an&s;wer. Olivia, after walking, had &s;at her&s;elf down by the &s;ide of her harp, bending pen&s;ively over it, and now and then drawing from it a &s;addening note. Suddenly, however, &s;he &s;truck the chords to happier &s;ounds, and, looking at her friends through the &s;paces of her harp&s;trings, &s;till enlivening the air, &s;he pau&s;ed to exclaim,&mdash; "I believe there is &s;omething of magic even in an in&s;trument of mu&s;ic. It has, this moment, in&s;pired me with a thought to turn all the jarring of our late objections, as to dear Henry's being of our party, into har|monious concord."</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the company were again thrown out of their arrangements.</P>
<P>"You may rememember," re&s;umed Olivia, &s;pringing up, after pre&s;&s;ing her lips on the harp, and prote&s;ting &s;he loved it dearly as a friend, "you cannot indeed forget the we&s;t door that leads from the little cypre&s;s walk
<PB N="375" REF="385">to the cemetery, and thence a&s;cends by &s;teps to the chapel. Of that door, knowing it is never opened but at the time of &s;epulture, I have not yet delivered the key, but I know where to find it in a moment. Henry and I had occa|&s;ion for it &s;everal times when we were carrying on our monumental labours. There, my Henry, you may &s;ee, yet be un&s;een. I will drop the curtain before the door of the cha|pel-hou&s;e, and as I mean that to be the boundary of the fir&s;t evening's exhibitions to the oblivion of as much as may be of every melancholy thought that lies beyond, there will not be the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on to &s;hut my Henry out of a &s;ight of the hap|pine&s;s to which he has &s;o largely contributed, while we are all &s;hielded from what we were apprehen&s;ive of before. What a lucky thought! Now don't fall into your philo&s;o|phies again, dear John; and pray do you, Mr. In&s;ufferable, &s;tand prepared to join my brother, in e&s;corting the ladies of the ca&s;tle, when 'tis <HI>their</HI> cue to &s;well the &s;cene. The poet I &s;ee has not a di&s;&s;entient word to offer, and &s;o the mu&s;ician will go fetch the &s;acred
<PB N="376" REF="386">key, and &s;ummon Jane to conclude the pre|paratives." She left her a&s;&s;ociates to fini&s;h her generous plan, and left them too with|out a rea&s;on to check her. "That abomi|nable villain," cries Partington, "carries all her points. After all, the lordly oak, man, is but as a &s;witch to that little twig-looking &s;hrub in blo&s;&s;om, called woman. Heigho! I &s;hould not wonder if one of the&s;e days a thing of this kind &s;hould &s;teal the heart out of my tough old trunk. By the bye, where is that Mrs. Herbert gone? From &s;omething I &s;aw, I take that lady to be an arrant &s;coundrel. Well, I'll have no hand in this matter. You are a couple of wife caitiffs, and I leave it between you. Settle it, and let me know; I'm ready for any mi&s;chief you propo&s;e." How &s;hall it be &s;ettled, my very dear and good Henry?" mo&s;t affectionately enquired the colonel, when Partington went out, "you &s;ee our predicament." "Be&s;t of men and of brothers," an&s;wered Henry, "tru&s;t me as far as I will tru&s;t my&s;elf. I am clear, even at this moment in which the pul&s;es of my head and heart beat with a violence I can neither help nor account for, I am clear that it
<PB N="377" REF="387">would not be in the power of any earthly being&mdash;no not the being neare&s;t to omnipo|tence, in potency over my &s;oul&mdash;to draw me from the honour, e&s;teem, reverence, and almo&s;t wor&s;hip, due to my angelic wife, and which it has long been my pride to make happie&s;t of the happy. But I know not, as yet, my weakne&s;s or my &s;trength, whether to con&s;ider the thronging emotions that now flu&s;h my cheek, &s;hake my frame, and po&s;&s;e&s;s my bo&s;om, as &s;ymptoms of terror, or of triumph."</P>
<P>Henry manife&s;ted vehement and tumultu|ous agitations while he &s;poke. "Perhaps the &s;en&s;ations which are now penetrating the central man&s;ions of my &s;oul," re&s;umed he, catching eagerly the the hand of John, "may be the re&s;ult only of too many &s;ur|prizes &s;uddenly accumulated, and mingling together,&mdash;perhaps I only want tranquillity to arrange, &s;elect, and &s;eparate them,&mdash;per|haps&mdash;and O join me in &s;upplicating God that it may,&mdash;perhaps the love, the virtues, the good faith, the guilele&s;s mind, of my dear, dear Olivia, may ri&s;e paramount, the unri|valled
<PB N="378" REF="388">victor, and lawful &s;overeign of my brea&s;t. Perhaps the eye, and voice, and hand, of long lo&s;t friends, will encounter mine, with gentle and &s;alutary greeting, cor|dial to each, to all. Brother, I am deter|mined on the trial, the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible method propo&s;ed is favourable. Fear me not. I will glide with the &s;ilence of death along the well-known man&s;ions of the dead; and if I find that my hour is not yet come, for the only &s;ort of a&s;&s;ociation which the holy peace of my Olivia requires I &s;hould form with any other human creature, and which is alone what I ought to give or to receive, in that moment I will retire unheard, un&s;een, and never again be led into a &s;imilar tempta|tion."</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the fiery wildne&s;s of this &s;peech, the inconceivable rapidity with which part of it was uttered, and the fearful &s;tarts that attended much of the action, there was, on the whole, &s;uch a genuine and generous vir|tue in the idea, and &s;uch connexion in the plan, that John, who had been more depre&s;&s;ed by fear than elevated by hope, now came to
<PB N="379" REF="389">a kind of compromi&s;e with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and thought it be&s;t to let the propo&s;al take place, and tru&s;t the direction of the event to that Providence, which, when human circum&s;pec|tion proves in&s;ufficient, and &s;ometimes, alas! counteracts, as if in mockery, its own too attentive care, can render the dreaded cir|cum&s;tance the cau&s;e of producing the very effect of which &s;hallow plotting, laborious mortals, &s;uppo&s;ed it would be utterly &s;ub|ver&s;ive.</P>

<P>THUS have we explained one of the extraordinary appearances which met the eye of Caroline Stuart; giving at the &s;ame time a view of Henry Fitzorton's return to the ca&s;tle; and we have unfolded the&s;e points and the incidents with which they connect after, rather than before, their taking place, that the reader might enjoy the like impre&s;&s;ion of the magic &s;cenery of the chapel-hou&s;e, unbroken by anticipations. But events, al&s;o, of great moment, happened in the hou&s;e of
<PB N="380" REF="390">Fitzorton after the&s;e chapel-hou&s;e &s;cenes were over; and having &s;ettled tho&s;e tumults of the Stuart family that fell out about the &s;ame period, this is the due place to go on with progre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Caroline Stuart was not the fir&s;t who had bent the knee at the tomb of her mother. Henry Fitzorton had done homage there before her. But that was not his immediate devotion. When the conference betwixt him&s;elf and the colonel ended, he repaired to that hallowed &s;pot where his own pro|genitors lay inurned, and where the ever-friendly Fitzortorns and Clares, united even in death, mingled their &s;acred du&s;t. There, &s;ometimes with Olivia, but oftener alone, had he directed his &s;teps. There, would he recite the &s;truggles of his head and heart, his infirmities, his fortitude. There, con|ceal his tears from the living, and, confide them to the &s;pirits of death. His la&s;t vi&s;it was of a milder &s;ort: he &s;ought the a&s;hes of Sir Armine in &s;miles: for he &s;ought it to pour forth his congratulations; to a&s;&s;ure the aweful inhabitants, which &s;urrounded
<PB N="381" REF="391">him, and chiefly they whom it mo&s;t con|cerned, his honoured parents, that after &s;truggling with &s;olitude and &s;ociety, with the powers of love and of in&s;anity, with the rooted pa&s;&s;ion of his heart, and the hor|rible &s;ugge&s;tions of murder&mdash;&s;elf murder, all, all the &s;ad effects of one dire mi&s;take, the con&s;trained di&s;po&s;al of his hand; the virtues of Olivia, had weaned him from the fell intents of de&s;pair and death, and won him back to rea&s;on and life. He no longer loathed the earth; his heart had become &s;u&s;|ceptible of comfort; he honoured the choice which his father had made for him; he had &s;acrificed his own; he loved his chil|dren; his brothers were parts of his own exi&s;tence; his neighbourhood was dear; and, ble&s;&s;ed be God! he could at la&s;t &s;urvey <HI>all</HI> its objects without terrour. The dark cloud that &s;eemed to cover the heavens and the earth, again admitted &s;ome rays of light, even as if re-created to his eye; it chiefly beamed from the power he &s;till had to ble&s;s his wife; for him&s;elf, the die had been ca&s;t; the bolt would rive where it &s;truck; he was
<PB N="382" REF="392">a wreck, but he had, perhaps, been the plank to &s;ave others from &s;inking: and he was thankful.</P>
<P>Such were Henry's confe&s;&s;ions in the vault of his fathers, when he fir&s;t felt the influence they de&s;cribe. But motives of a &s;till more affecting kind now drew him to tho&s;e man|&s;ions. "O, my father! my father!" cried he, in rapid and earne&s;t &s;upplication, kneel|ing by the coffins that held the relicts of both his parents; "now a&s;&s;i&s;t your &s;on;&mdash;now &s;trengthen your Henry;&mdash;let not the deep &s;car that has &s;eamed the wound, be again torn open. Spare, I conjure you, the &s;on whom your mi&s;guided,&mdash;but ble&s;&s;ed hand, has laid long &s;ince on the altar.&mdash;And you, my mother, who&s;e cold du&s;t, is more precious than the vital power which warms the&s;e cla&s;ping arms, a&s;&s;i&s;t thy hu&s;band's prayer.&mdash;O! let not the victim who has &s;o lately &s;urvived his &s;acrifice be bound again! Driven back on all he loved,&mdash;on all he feared,&mdash;alas! on all he &s;hunned! Oh, ye &s;pirits of heaven! who once inhabited the&s;e holy ruins, do I invoke!&mdash;and thou, O venerable father of
<PB N="383" REF="393">my Olivia! do thou become a &s;uppliant with the God of Power in the cau&s;e of thy beloved child!&mdash;Pray alike for the hu&s;band, and the wife, and all their little ones!"</P>
<P>Having breathed the&s;e a&s;pirations, he returned to the ca&s;tle: there waited for him her, for who&s;e felicity he had importuned the dead, and the &s;pirits that live for ever. Lovely, and &s;carcely le&s;s pure than one of tho&s;e,&mdash;&s;he pre&s;ented to him the fatal key that was to give him once more the view of Caroline Stuart. "All is on my part ready, my Henry," &s;aid Olivia, "but &s;urely you are unwell,&mdash;unquiet,&mdash;the approaching &s;cene will chear you: come, deare&s;t, let love conduct you to friend&s;hip. You mu&s;t not feel the&s;e things too &s;trongly." She led him to the we&s;tern door, then pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily through the place of Sepulture, a&s;cended the chapel, &s;hewed him the man|ner how Jane and &s;he had contrived the curtain &s;o as to give him &s;ight into the chapel-hou&s;e, and a &s;ecurity from others; then after many a tender expre&s;&s;ion, went tound to the other door, accompanied by
<PB N="384" REF="394">her Jane, and with a heart throbbing with benignity, waited to confer happine&s;s, impa|tient of delay, only as it retarded the com|munication. The cau&s;e of that delay on the part of Arthur and his friends, has been made known to the reader. On the part of Mrs. Fitzorton and Jane Atwood, it was filled by rendering their preparatives more ac|ceptable: while Henry gliding with &s;teps now well &s;u&s;tained, and now faltering, cor|re&s;ponding to the ri&s;ings or &s;inkings of his &s;pirit, alternately ruminated in the burial place, at the tomb of lady Matilda, and at the altar of the chapel.</P>
<P>At length, the moment came, and that moment was deci&s;ive. He heard again the &s;ound of Caroline's voice: he &s;aw from his &s;ecret &s;tand her downca&s;t eye, her &s;ainted air, her &s;acred form: and he &s;aw the change which &s;orrow, long-&s;uffering, corroding cares, and perpetual vigils, had cau&s;ed. He ha&s;tily de&s;c ended into the burial place, and concealed his heart-felt groans, and &s;hed his burning tears on her mother's coffin. "Soon, ah! &s;oon, mu&s;t &s;he join
<PB N="385" REF="395">you here, O mouldered beauty!&mdash;but, alas! her figure has already been the prey of the tyrant. The canker of grief, I &s;ee, has eaten into the core of her heart, and with immiti|gable tooth is &s;till devouring her alive!"</P>
<P>He returned to his place of ob&s;ervation. The room was filled with objects dear to his thoughts: yet he fa&s;tened but on one; his trembling eye, now deluged with tears, and now parched by a fever of the &s;oul, fixed on, and followed Caroline. Olivia's mu&s;ic was unheeded: his own poe&s;y extingui&s;hed: all that beauty, love, and benevolence had done to grace the &s;cene, was covered from his view as with the mantle of death.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t &s;uffocated with &s;en&s;ations, and their proper reliefs controuled, he again de&s;cended into the chambers of darkne&s;s: he wept, &s;upplicated, and again returned. Exhau&s;ted, at length, he &s;at down on one of the &s;eats of the porch. Scarce had a minute elap&s;ed, ere the other &s;eat was filled al&s;o: filled by Caroline. The mourner had there attempted to weep and to pray, unob&s;erved by the happy. Her &s;ight was dim, and her
<PB N="386" REF="396">hands cro&s;&s;ed over her eyes. A heavy &s;igh broke from her heart, and penetrated that of Henry. Alas! he was within its breath. An an&s;wering &s;igh heaved his own bo&s;om; and he ro&s;e; Caroline &s;tarted. Henry had moved &s;ome paces, and was half lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s of the chapel; but a &s;aint light from the <HI>refectoire,</HI> by the aperture in the curtain, and the opening which Caroline had left on effecting her concealment, gleamed indi&s;tinctly on the chapel. A figure moved before her more aweful, more affect|ing than all &s;he had &s;een in the &s;ubter|raneous pa&s;&s;age. It had the motion of Henry: but in the next moment it ru&s;hed forward and was &s;een no more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY pau&s;ed awhile in the burial place, to wi&s;h he had been numbered among&s;t its inhabitants, before he had witne&s;&s;ed the &s;cene&mdash;from a farther view of which he was hurrying&mdash;and then pa&s;t on. He reached the ca&s;tle a con&s;iderable time before the re&s;t
<PB N="387" REF="397">of the party&mdash;before, indeed, the colonel and Partington, with the ladies, could have got to the chapel-hou&s;e, in order to e&s;cort Olivia. He luckily, therefore, gained his chamber, which was that his father had u&s;ed, without interruption. The very &s;word with which John had puni&s;hed Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, hung over the chimney piece. Henry looked at it, and traver&s;ed the apartment with wild and irregular &s;teps. On the fla&s;h of a &s;udden thought he clo&s;ed the windows on the in&s;ide&mdash;locked and bolted his door&mdash; He took down the &s;word, drew it from the &s;heath, and examined its point&mdash;"No," &s;aid he, "this&mdash;this&mdash;may not be the in&s;tru|ment. The blood which was &s;hed in defence of a father, &s;hall not be wa&s;hed out by that of a &s;on, even though that father has made life in&s;upportable."&mdash;He replaced the &s;word&mdash;but his &s;en&s;es were &s;till un&s;ettled, and the dire image of &s;elf-de&s;truction appeared &s;till to po&s;&s;e&s;s him. Perceiving a movement about the bed&mdash;he leaped up, and throwing a&s;ide the curtains, demanded furiou&s;ly who dared to interrupt him? "Only little John,
<PB N="388" REF="398">papa," exclaimed a &s;oft voice, "Your own dear little John, who has crept into your bed ju&s;t to get a ki&s;s, and a good night, from you and mamma&mdash;when you came home&mdash;as you all ran away from me, and left me to my&s;elf, a whole&mdash;whole evening, ju&s;t as if I had no papa or mamma at all&mdash; which God forbid&mdash;for what would poor little John, or great John either, or even &s;i&s;ter, with all her beauty, do without them?"</P>
<P>"A voice&mdash;yes, it was a voice from heaven," exclaimed Henry, running to the bed. "Dear, dear boy, you have &s;aved your poor father&mdash;you have &s;aved him from&mdash;" "From what papa? O! how cold you are!&mdash;do come to bed; little John &s;hall warm you in his bo&s;om&mdash;ju&s;t thus," &s;aid the &s;on, carrying his father's hand to his brea&s;t. "Ah! let us warm one another's hearts, papa. And I have not &s;aid my prayers yet&mdash;&s;o we may &s;ay them together."</P>
<P>"And &s;o we will, my ble&s;&s;ed deliverer!" cried Henry, tenderly ki&s;&s;ing the child, and laying down by his &s;ide, "and Johnny &s;hall
<PB N="389" REF="399">beg of God to love&mdash;to forgive his father&mdash;and God will hear him." "Oh, that he will, and you too, papa&mdash;for he hears all good people. I can &s;ay all you &s;et me by heart&mdash;mamma has heard me every night &s;ince you were gone. The belief, the lord's prayer, and the ten commandments, without mi&s;&s;ing a word&mdash;now only hark." Hereupon the innocent prattler repeated tho&s;e holy ordi|nances, in which Henry, with repentant &s;pirit, fervently joined: and when he came to the inhibition of murder, an icy horror &s;hot through his con&s;cious heart, and as he thrice repeated the words&mdash;"O! wretched man!" he cried, "what did thy ra&s;hne&s;s meditate?&mdash;Would&s;t thou have put to death, at one &s;troke, father, wife, children, and friends? and expo&s;ed thy immortal &s;oul to the wrath of the Eternal?" "O! what wicked man would have killed all tho&s;e, papa? Do let us &s;ay over our prayers again &mdash;to beg God Almighty to forgive him too: for, mamma &s;ays, the good &s;hould pray for the naughty, if they be ever &s;o wicked. O! how often have I heard her pray for that
<PB N="390" REF="400">bad&mdash;bad Sir Gui&s;e of the abbey: very often, indeed, but not &s;o often as &s;he has ble&s;&s;ed good papa. Ah! how &s;he does love papa!&mdash; not more than Johnny though."</P>
<P>Saying this, the &s;oother threw his arms fondly round his &s;elf-rebuking parent; drew him, by many a fold, clo&s;er to his little heart, and compo&s;ed the troubled &s;oul to &s;en&s;ations of piety and peace. The inter|ce&s;&s;ion of a &s;potle&s;s child was offered up for the evil thoughts his de&s;pair had induced. And after he had, again and again, &s;uppli|cated the throne of mercy and of grace, the kind re&s;torer of hara&s;&s;ed nature &s;unk him to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>When the company returned, Olivia's fir&s;t enquiries were directed towards her hu&s;|band. Somewhat alarmed at hearing he had not been &s;een, &s;he ran through the rooms it was u&s;ual with him to frequent, and at la&s;t coming into her chamber &s;he found both the father and the &s;on fa&s;t a&s;leep in each other's arms.</P>
<P>Tenderly impre&s;&s;ing a ki&s;s, and breathing a &s;igh of pride and happine&s;s on them both,
<PB N="391" REF="401">&s;he made her report below &s;tairs, to the comfort of the anxious colonel, and to the &s;atisfaction of all.</P>
<P>As Henry awoke he &s;aw his brother John &s;tanding by his &s;ide. "And how fares my dear, and &s;till good, Henry?" enquired he, with generous &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;yet not good. Well&mdash;yet mo&s;t wicked. But que&s;tion me not to-night; in the morning I will unfold my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Shall we not &s;ee you among&s;t us? Will not your ab&s;ence &s;eem &s;trange?" a&s;ked the colonel.</P>
<P>"Let the fatigue of my journey, and &s;ub&s;equent walking, watching, &amp;c. explain and excu&s;e it. I am unequal to company at pre&s;ent; but if Olivia brings me a gla&s;s of wine, after your repa&s;t, I will drink her dear health in it&mdash;but not till the with|drawing hour. Meantime, I will to bed, and this ble&s;&s;ed boy, to whom I owe more than life, mu&s;t be our companion for this one night. I cannot endure the thoughts of his removal now&mdash;do tell his mother &s;o.
<PB N="392" REF="402">See how &s;ound he &s;leeps, brother. Such is the repo&s;e of innocence."</P>
<P>As Henry made the&s;e reflections, he care&s;&s;ed his &s;on&mdash;repeated his obligations to him&mdash;took his little hand from the &s;pot where it was laid&mdash;on his father's brea&s;t&mdash; to pre&s;s it to his lips&mdash;then replaced it; while John, delighted by the effect, without knowing there was any thing a&s;toni&s;hing in the cau&s;e&mdash;Henry being at all times an exem|plary father&mdash;went down &s;tairs, and with faithful plea&s;ure related what he had heard and &s;een.</P>
<P>When Olivia &s;oon after withdrew, &s;he found that her little John and Henry had again fallen a&s;leep, and &s;incerely uttering a prayer for both, including in it her ab&s;ent daughter, and all the friends whom &s;he pre|&s;umed &s;he had made as happy as her&s;elf, &s;he crowned a day of benevolent exertion with a night of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY, when he awoke, complained of an extreme head-ach, and imputed it to the heat of the apartment. Alas! the heat was in him&s;elf: for it was towards the end of October, and the air had been &s;harpened in the night by a fro&s;t. "It is very early, I believe, my &s;weet Olivia," &s;aid he to his wife, who&s;e pure and light &s;lumbers were ea&s;ily cha&s;ed away, although they had been &s;erene, "yet I think," continued he, "that a turn or two in the garden will do me good." "I will ri&s;e and attend you love," an&s;wered Olivia. Henry over-ruled this. "Con&s;ider," &s;aid he, "I &s;tole home to bed long before you, and it is but fair that you &s;hould be even with me: another thing is, I propo&s;e to return pre&s;ently, and be&s;ides the dear boy, you &s;ee, &s;leeps &s;till. Hu&s;h, we &s;hall di&s;turb him, poor fellow. Tell him, if he &s;hould wake before I come back, to remember me in his morning prayers, and ki&s;s him for me a thou&s;and times, for his
<PB N="394" REF="404">evening ones&mdash;and O! tell him too, that I live only for him&s;elf, his &s;i&s;ter, and his mother."</P>
<P>The fonde&s;t, deare&s;t, wi&s;hes of Mrs. Fitzorton being ever included in performing tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, &s;he begged him to guard again&s;t the early air, which however warm it might &s;eem to him in the chamber, would be different out of doors, and then &s;he re&s;igned him tenderly to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the foot of the great &s;tairca&s;e that led into the grand hall, from which there were two doors, the one commanding a view of the woodlands of the abbey, the other lead|ing to the grounds and park of the ca&s;tle through the &s;hrubbery; he &s;tood for a few moments, divided in his thoughts, at which of the doors to go out:&mdash;as if follow|ing the impul&s;e of nature, his fir&s;t movements were towards that which led to the man&s;ion of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart: yet turning from thence abruptly, even while his hand was upon the bar that fa&s;tened it, he hurried to the one which led into his own grounds, as if in obedience to the dictate of duty and rea&s;on.
<PB N="395" REF="405">But he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve, either that &s;ome one of the family had gone forth even &s;ooner than him&s;elf, or that his &s;ervants had been very negligent, for the door was not only unbolted and unlocked, but very &s;lightly clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>He entered the park, cro&s;&s;ed into the &s;hrubbery, and walked up and down the fir&s;t path that pre&s;ented it&s;elf. His mind crouded with thought,&mdash;a mi&s;t blending with the fro&s;t, had rendered objects dreary and indi&s;|tinct. Every drooping &s;hrub, and every flower in the train of autumn were loaded with heavy dew half di&s;&s;olved and half con|gealed. As the ha&s;ty &s;teps of Henry bru&s;hed them away, he exclaimed&mdash;"Yes&mdash;all nature is in tears!" he &s;ighed and pa&s;&s;ed on. The &s;un ro&s;e, and gradually di&s;per&s;ing the fog, di&s;played the later beauties of the year more clearly, but &s;hewed them in their decline. Henry, after exerci&s;e too violent for either felicity or health, &s;tood leaning again&s;t an alcove on the out&s;ide: he &s;aw the withering leaf fall alike from the loftie&s;t tree, and the mo&s;t lowly &s;hrub&mdash;"Such is man!" thought
<PB N="396" REF="406">he, "and &s;uch the equal fate of the ambitious and the humble!" As his eye &s;urveyed the different objects within its reach, and beheld on all the vi&s;ible &s;igns of &s;ickne&s;s and decay: "All nature is dying," cried he aloud&mdash;"&s;ee! even at the point of death! then what is man!"</P>
<P>"Immortal!" an&s;wered a voice imme|diately from behind the place where he &s;tood. It was the voice of John Fitzorton. The brothers embraced. "For once," &s;aid the colonel, "my dear Henry, I am a more early wanderer than your&s;elf. My night was unquiet, but, I tru&s;t, your's was &s;weet: and yet the remarks I heard you ju&s;t now make, or rather the tones in which they were ex|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;eem not the re&s;ult of a refre&s;hing &s;leep."</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t brother," cried Henry, "if &s;leep, which is but for a night, is &s;weet, what mu&s;t be the &s;leep of death?"</P>
<P>"Still &s;weeter," an&s;wered John, "for that is eternal waking&mdash;I have wholly re|covered the tone of my mind, Henry, &s;ince I came into the garden. Ob&s;erve the wide
<PB N="397" REF="407">&s;preading ravage of the vegetable world as it lies around us in ruins."</P>
<P>"I have ob&s;erved it with a &s;inking heart, and it has made me de&s;cend, atom as I am, into a more mode&s;t &s;en&s;e of my own in&s;igni|ficancy, brother," &s;aid Henry, with an air of &s;elf-aba&s;ement.</P>
<P>"And my heart, on the contrary," re|&s;umed John, "it has elevated from this low earth to the heaven of heavens&mdash;from things peri&s;hable to powers that &s;hall never know corruption&mdash;from my decaying body to my everla&s;ting &s;oul. That proud oak, my bro|ther, may, in this poor world, maintain its &s;tation far longer than its lord, even though the honours are now falling from its top, but when its very roots &s;hall be trampled into du&s;t, by the power which putteth all mortal things under his feet, I tru&s;t, in the pardoner of offences, and the recompencer of virtue, that Henry, John, and James, Fitzorton, and all who are dear to them, will be rejoicing in the unfading bli&s;s of eternity. Be proud then, my brother; a&s;cend to the dignity of your|&s;elf
<PB N="398" REF="408">&mdash;ri&s;e to the &s;ublime height of your own nature."</P>
<P>The eyes of Henry were &s;treaming with tears, yet they were rai&s;ed to heaven, and, "O!" he cried, "it is from the pardoner of offence! not the recompen&s;er of virtue! that Henry mu&s;t have hope in death.&mdash;My brother," continued he, "I am weak as childhood&mdash;but, alas! without its innocence! Yet what have I not attempted&mdash;what will I not attempt to fulfill every duty&mdash;to avoid every &s;nare? O thou my brother, and my friend&mdash;thou chri&s;tian&mdash;philo&s;opher&mdash;guide and conduct me back to &s;cenes of le&s;s agoni|&s;ing thought, and keep me there.&mdash;Forbear, ah, &s;till forbear to que&s;tion me. I have kept within the conditions. I a&s;cended from the gloomy repo&s;itories of death, and &s;aw the one created being mo&s;t afflicting, mo&s;t dear to &s;ight&mdash;&s;aw her &s;carce living&mdash;about to be numbered with their cold inhabitants, yet I did not ru&s;h into her pre&s;ence. I felt her heart-&s;ick figh upon my cheek. I &s;aw her &s;ink almo&s;t at my feet&mdash;yet rai&s;ed her not to
<PB N="399" REF="409">my arms&mdash;but left her&mdash;left her on the cold ground, and with &s;avage &s;peed ru&s;hed from her fainting form. You had my promi&s;e, and it has not been broken. So far virtue and my brother are obeyed. But I mu&s;t move again from hence. Beings far, far more valued, more valuable than my&s;elf, demand it&mdash;my wife! my dear wife! my children! my friends!&mdash;yet I know not how, or where&mdash; nor can I think&mdash;O think for me!&mdash;Some|thing, and &s;peedily, mu&s;t be done, or all mu&s;t be lo&s;t&mdash;this throbbing head, this pant|ing heart&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;foretell it!"</P>
<P>He clung round his brother's neck&mdash;then &s;tarted from him, and then again enfolded him&mdash;now incongruous, now coherent, as he &s;poke&mdash;and woman's love, no, not the love of his Olivia, could more fondly return his embraces, &s;oothe his wandering, pity his weakne&s;s, or confirm his hope, than did the rugged John Fitzorton in this trying moment. He ki&s;&s;ed his cheek, wiped away the tears he found upon it, yet bathed it with his own. "Ah, my unhappy Henry, my deare&s;t, and &s;till good, brother&mdash;virtuous even in agony:
<PB N="400" REF="410">yet, O! be comforted, think on the more di&s;a&s;trous wretch&mdash;alone and hopele&s;s&mdash;to who&s;e &s;ad fate I pointed in our late conver|&s;ation, &s;hut for ever from his object, by bonds yet &s;tronger&mdash;bonds which even death could not remove&mdash;yet forbid the privilege of e&s;cape, and condemned by inexorable ne|ce&s;&s;ity&mdash;even by virtue&mdash;&s;trange my&s;terious fate! to &s;ee her for months, for years, the only form that could ever truly enchant his eye, to hear the only voice that was ever mu&s;ic to his ear&mdash;not like the voice of the Syren that once lured and betrayed,&mdash;and to ob&s;erve the only mind which has ever con|veyed to his idea the mo&s;t perfect image of truth and goodne&s;s; ah, think on him&mdash;on him, not culled from fancy's painted &s;tore&mdash;but one, whom I have known, a real victim, and had you known him too, you would have wept his &s;orrows, and if not forgot your own, have owned that they were ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s to his. Indeed you would. Yet never, never &s;hall &s;he know the cau&s;e of his de&s;pair."</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="411">All the powers of wonder and of pity &s;eem|ed &s;uddenly to over&s;pread the face of Henry! and as he examined the countenance of John, with an earne&s;tne&s;s he had never looked into it before, retiring gently from his arms, he appeared to puzzle awhile betwixt conjecture and di&s;covery, and then run again into his brother's embraces.&mdash;"<HI>Shall</HI> &s;he know!" exclaimed the a&s;toni&s;hed Henry! "Is he &s;till exi&s;ting? &s;till one who &s;ees that form, who hears that mu&s;ic, who ob&s;erves the work|ings of that heavenly &s;oul?&mdash;then is he a wretch indeed!

<P>Henry appeared to be &s;inking from his bro|ther's arms, and had bent one knee on the ground as he cea&s;ed &s;peaking:&mdash;even as though he thought his clo&s;ing words applied: but John hurrying him up, as if not uncon&s;cious of his meaning yet more than he expre&s;&s;ed, cried
<PB N="402" REF="412">with a voice of &s;ome trouble, "Hu&s;h, brother, for heaven's &s;ake hu&s;h: we are ob&s;erved!"</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed," &s;aid little John, who came running up the alcove walk, followed by Olivia, "you can come into the garden to hug my uncle, Mr. papa, but leave poor mamma and I to our&s;elves."&mdash;"I am come here, my deare&s;t Henry, to invite you to a di&s;h of coffee, which, on account of your early ri&s;ing and walking, may do you good, &s;o I got up to make it my&s;elf; and if the colonel has been as early a rambler as your|&s;elf, it will be of &s;ervice to him likewi&s;e."&mdash; "Nor &s;hall it be refu&s;ed my ever good Olivia," &s;aid Henry, "I will an&s;wer for us both: and this ble&s;&s;ed boy &s;hall partake,&mdash; yonder too, I &s;ee Partington and his ladies. Let us lo&s;e no time then."</P>
<P>A tranquil, nay, a plea&s;ant breakfa&s;t en|&s;ued, even to the &s;urprize of Olivia her&s;elf, who, from little John's perplexed account, and the la&s;t night's di&s;cour&s;e, and from her own morning ob&s;ervations, had her fears that Henry was again out of health or &s;pirits.
<PB N="403" REF="413">John was at fir&s;t the mo&s;t taciturne on this occa&s;ion of the whole party, but re&s;umed him&s;elf in the cour&s;e of the repa&s;t; and Henry, from whatever motive, was for the whole of that day, more tranquil than he had been at any period &s;ince his la&s;t arrival at the ca&s;tle. Partington, who&s;e &s;pirits were always elated or depre&s;&s;ed by the fair or &s;oul weather of tho&s;e he loved, now found the Fitzortons, who had long been his grand barometers, more calm and temperate, than from the late &s;tormy violences he had rea&s;on to expect; he therefore gave a loo&s;e to his accu&s;tomed &s;currility, mixed with a thou&s;and good humoured turns, with &s;uch effect, as &s;ettled him in the be&s;t opinions of Johanna and Mrs. Herbert, who, on their part, contrived al&s;o, by their endearing behaviour to Olivia, to be &s;et down among&s;t his mo&s;t atrocious incorrigibles.</P>

<P>ON the day following, however, the tempe&s;t, which had thus blown over, re|turned: it had rolled to a di&s;tant quarter, but rolled back to its point. Henry, in great di&s;order, &s;ought a &s;econd conference with John. "My brother," &s;aid the former, "there is no bringing all men's minds, any more than their per&s;ons, to an equal &s;ize, or &s;trength. I honour the greatly good and greatly &s;uffering being, who lives un&s;ub|dued by temptation; but I cannot reach his virtue; I cannot profit by his example. I will not di&s;grace my&s;elf or di&s;tre&s;s you by telling you where the&s;e truant feet, guided by my erring heart would have led me in the twilight of ye&s;terday, when, you remember, I petitioned for, and obtained a &s;olitary hour."</P>
<P>"To the abbey, no doubt," an&s;wered John, much di&s;compo&s;ed. "Fatal was the hour in which my erring heart conducted thither its old inhabitants. You have paid them a
<PB N="405" REF="415">vi&s;it, I pre&s;ume, and in one moment brought to nought the laboured project of many a diligent hour. Shallow thoughted mor|tals! behold, here, another le&s;&s;on to humble the pride of human fore&s;ight! I am fallen with the fabric I rai&s;ed, and &s;hall bury my friends, brother, &s;i&s;ter, and all whom I would have &s;aved, in the ruins!"</P>
<P>"O no, my brother!" an&s;wered Henry, "you have erected a temple to pity, friend|&s;hip, honour, and, I tru&s;t in God, to hap|pine&s;s! I, and I only, feel my&s;elf unworthy to enter its &s;acred gates and do homage there! Mi&s;take me not&mdash;weak, fragile as I am, I have not invaded, by willing ra&s;hne&s;s, the &s;anctuary where your generous hand has placed the penitent and the mourner. But, blu&s;hing I confe&s;s, that I bent my mi&s;guiding &s;teps that way:&mdash;Yes, I took a forbidden path, the one rarely trodden,&mdash;and yet, even there, I met my dear, my long lo&s;t"&mdash; "Caroline!" &s;aid John. "No, her bro|ther," &s;aid Henry. "I am &s;orry for it," ob&s;erved the colonel, "the lieutenant was ra&s;h, and forgot the bounds pre&s;cribed;
<PB N="406" REF="416">the bounds of honour."&mdash;"Within tho&s;e bounds I &s;aw him," an&s;wered Henry. "Then the ra&s;hne&s;s was yours. Yet you &s;aid, you had not intruded." "Nor did I, the rencontre happened in a place where I could expect to meet only the form of melancholy;&mdash;the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age.&mdash; Even there my friend ru&s;hed upon me una|wares from an angle almo&s;t at the cavern's mouth. So far from expecting, he furiou&s;ly &s;eized my throat, demanding the name of the lurking ruffian, the midnight robber he had at la&s;t detected? A drawn &s;word was in his hand,&mdash;and, in the next in&s;tant would have been in my heart, had not the well|known voice and name of Henry Fitzorton arre&s;ted the &s;troke. 'O gracious heaven! I &s;hould have murdered my friend, my dear, dear Henry Fitzorton!' ejaculated he in an agony, and as he &s;poke, a groan.&mdash;No doubt the work of terrified fancy &s;eemed to &s;ound near the place where we &s;tood. He threw down the in&s;trument of death, and pre&s;&s;ed me to his bo&s;om. My friend was in my arms. 'I a&s;k not, O, my Henry!' &s;aid he,
<PB N="407" REF="417">'the &s;tate of your heart,&mdash;you, no doubt, have heard the &s;tate of mine: but if your's be not all Olivia's, or, even if it be, for|bear, I conjure you, to invade my &s;i&s;ter's peace!' He then hurried to other &s;ubjects, talked to me of fearful &s;ights, of frightful founds,&mdash;told me that &s;uch an air of my&s;tery had there inve&s;ted the abbey, both within and without,&mdash;he was him&s;elf that night come forth armed to attempt a di&s;covery, and had encountered &s;trange appearances, which eluded his pur&s;uit. He informed me that Jerom and Jonathan, with the intrepid Arthur and his fearle&s;s Flore&s;co, were al&s;o on the watch in their different &s;tations. He concluded, alas! by giving me credit for virtues I have never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; applauded my con&s;iderate, my god-like benevolence, as he called it, in admini&s;tering comfort to the wretched, my&s;elf un&s;een: and then ended by ob&s;erving, that as the pro&s;perity of his family had been derived from the kindne&s;s of John, &s;o would the peace of his &s;i&s;ter, dearer than all other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, be protected by Henry Fitzorton!&mdash;Ah! my beloved brother, I
<PB N="408" REF="418">could only an&s;wer by ardently &s;training him to my bo&s;om; pouring out my ble&s;|&s;ings on his hou&s;e; on my knees a&s;&s;eve|rating, that if the power were mine, I would watch and combat for years un|wearied to repel its enemies,&mdash;and then, alas! unequal to farther conver&s;e, I ran back with trembling &s;teps from the cavern into the fore&s;ts, di&s;gui&s;ing my agitation in &s;udden illne&s;s, and yet, heaven knows, that was not counterfeit.&mdash;Behold the hi&s;tory of my un&s;ought tre&s;pa&s;s;&mdash;behold, dear John, and prevent its repetition. I have lo&s;t all confidence in my&s;elf; others, therefore, &s;hould not tru&s;t me.&mdash;O! think of &s;ome means to &s;ave me then from my&s;elf. Your plan for that &s;afety &s;hall be mine."</P>
<P>"Generous Charles, and worthy Henry! I tru&s;t a fair reward awaits ye both," cried the colonel.&mdash;"Your narrative, brother, has filled me with various objects for reflection; but the one which more immediately pre&s;&s;es, is that which regards your&s;elf&mdash;the grief of this poor, conflicting bo&s;om." Here John, in his u&s;ual way, &s;at him&s;elf down to &s;olitary
<PB N="409" REF="419">thought, while Henry perceiving his &s;on at &s;port in the garden, went to his little con|&s;oler and pre&s;erver, as now he called him, hoping to gain compo&s;ure enough to bear &s;uch endearing &s;ociety before he returned to his wife.</P>
<P>Although the time advanced more near when Olivia would naturally require and re|ceive the tendere&s;t &s;upport from the atten|tions of her hu&s;band; yet, as it was altoge|ther improper to convey her, at &s;uch a mo|ment, from her comfortable home, where all had been long ready for, perhaps, one of the greate&s;t trials of human nature, even though human kind is thence continued on the earth; yet, as the pre&s;&s;ure of unfore&s;een events and &s;urrounding circum&s;tances, had made the environs of the ca&s;tle and the ab|bey more perilous to all the inhabitants even than they had ever been before; and, as on every po&s;&s;ible ground of di&s;cretion, Henry's virtuous and manly propo&s;ition ought to be adopted, it was &s;ettled by the good colonel, that his brother &s;hould again be &s;tolen by Par|tington&mdash;that little John, in order to be ex|changed
<PB N="410" REF="420">for little Caroline, who was &s;till at Bury, &s;hould be of the runaway party;&mdash; that Mrs. Herbert &s;hould be tru&s;ted with the &s;cheme; and that ju&s;t as it was about to take place&mdash;the coach at the door, and trunks packed&mdash;John &s;hould betray the con&s;piracy, and undertake to bring about Mrs. Fitzorton's con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This arrangement was only part of what was forming in the colonel's mind. He be|lieved that now Sir Gui&s;e was much recover|ed, the whole abbey family might be re|moved, at lea&s;t, beyond the track, and out of the ob&s;ervation of his brother: and this, he thought, would be a wi&s;e mea&s;ure, free of all other con&s;iderations, as it would con|vey them from a &s;pot &s;urrounded with dan|gers. He imagined Henry might then come back, and that while his worthy mind was employed, as he well knew it would be, in the &s;oothing offices of which his Olivia would then &s;tand in need, he &s;hould have no aching void left for the divi&s;ion of a wandering image: and, indeed, he began to think it would be be&s;t for the ca&s;tle family to &s;ettle
<PB N="411" REF="421">el&s;ewhere, when &s;uch a mea&s;ure could &s;fely be propo&s;ed.&mdash;All of this plan, which was then proper for Henry to know, was im|parted. Henry yielded, and was much &s;ooth|ed by the idea of little John being his com|panion &mdash;"and yet, alas! my brother," &s;ighed he, "what have I to hope from the pre&s;ervation of a few days, or months, or even years!"</P>
<P>"Every thing, even from a few hours," an&s;wered John. "The evil which has been growing for half the life of man, may, by the Providence of God, be in a moment removed. Let us rely on that Providence, and, by taking what at lea&s;t appear the be&s;t mea&s;ures, hope, that they will be directed to that end." Henry &s;ighed, and a&s;&s;ented.&mdash; Partington was ductile to every generous aim. All was prepared with &s;ecrecy and di&s;|patch; and while Partington was handing his party into the coach, railing and raving in whi&s;per&mdash;the colonel, who had been con|ducting his impeachment, and detailed his charges, brought round Mrs. Fitzorton to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in apprehending the con&s;pirators.&mdash;
<PB N="412" REF="422">"I &s;eize you ladies and gentlemen," &s;aid John, "in the name of Olivia." "O thou mo&s;t incorrigible good-for-nothing traitor!" exclaimed the Squire, bundling in little John, who enjoyed the &s;cheme at his heart; and &s;eeing Johanna with Olivia, "I have a good mind to have that hand&s;ome hu&s;&s;ey into the bargain." Then &s;hutting the door, after he had leaped in him&s;elf, he flouri&s;hed his hat, crying&mdash;"aha! this is trick for trick! one runaway job for another. Let the ra&s;cal &s;ee if he can e&s;cape again&mdash;I have him now, father and &s;on, old dame Partlet, and the family-coach into the bargain&mdash;Drive on caitiffs&mdash;drive on, and never &s;top till you get to the end of the world."</P>
<P>The po&s;tillions, &s;etting it all down as a new frolic of their old &s;quire, who was a great favourite with them all, obeyed orders, and away they drove. But tears &s;tood in the eyes of Olivia.&mdash;"It is but for a day or two&mdash;and to bring back my &s;weet little niece, and Partington's brother, the phy&s;ician, who is daily expected at the Bury, from the Ea&s;t-Indies, and, in &s;hort, to &s;trengthen and en|liven
<PB N="413" REF="423">our party on the ir return&mdash;and &s;o e'en let them go, deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid the colonel. "Well then," &s;ighingly, an&s;wered Mrs. Fitzorton,&mdash;"we mu&s;t endeavour to do with|out them a little; but &s;till I know not the time when I could &s;o ill &s;pare them."&mdash; "Would to heaven I could any way render the lo&s;s of their &s;ociety le&s;s irk&s;ome," &s;aid the &s;oft and diffident Johanna; "but, per|haps, the good lieutenant, and&mdash;&s;hould the baronet's health permit&mdash;that of Caroline might do much."&mdash;"Truly, &s;weet maid," an&s;wered Mrs. Fitzorton, "if any thing in nature could fill the void which the ab&s;ence of my hu&s;band and children always leaves, the con&s;olations you propo&s;e to me would have their effect; yet, under the mo&s;t gloomy &s;en&s;ations, &s;uch &s;ociety mu&s;t be mo&s;t wel|come to my heart."</P>
<P>"I will my&s;elf go to the abbey," &s;aid the colonel, "and make report how far our &s;ociety may be admi&s;&s;ible."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus, in &s;ome &s;ort, reconciled both the ladies under his protection, John Fitzorton directed his &s;teps to the abbey, where, however, many objects of increa&s;ing difficulty remained to be adju&s;ted. For, al|though the generous conduct of his unhappy brother, the tender di&s;play of the true and mode&s;t feelings of Johanna, and his own &s;till unyielded power of mind, had &s;oftened the pa&s;t &s;cenes, the pro&s;pect of the future ro&s;e to his view, convolved in clouds, the di&s;|per&s;ion or even clearing of which &s;eemed to require an energy greater than any he had yet employed.</P>
<P>To him, therefore, who can bring light out of darkne&s;s, he breathed an earne&s;t prayer as he took the way that led to the abbey: for John Fitzorton was not a con|vert to that weakly proud doctrine which depends wholly on human means; but always thought,&mdash;and as he thought&mdash;he acted, the
<PB N="415" REF="425">philo&s;ophical, enlightened, and ennobled chri&s;tian character. As he proceeded towards the abbey, he encountered Burton upon the back of his little hor&s;e Bu&s;y, po&s;ting to the ca&s;tle. The whole detail of the apothe|cary immediately de&s;cribed the terrors under which his patient laboured, in con&s;equence of the illu&s;ive appearances&mdash;adding thereto an account of tho&s;e which he and his friends had &s;een in their way to the chapel-hou&s;e."&mdash; "I know nothing about &s;uch gho&s;tly fan|cies," cried John; "but the &s;ooner your patient and, indeed, all his family can get from them the better. In a word, my friend, I am projecting a general remove; for as matters have turned I &s;ee no tranquillity either of &s;oul or of body, in this once peace|ful and happy neighbourhood, at pre&s;ent: our fir&s;t operation is on Sir Gui&s;e Stuart; if we can but get him by any means into a travel|ling &s;ituation, I think, I &s;till &s;ee a path out of all our perplexities. Burton declared he had hopes, if no new phanta&s;ms and di&s;|turbances, real or imaginary, fell out, a few more nights' re&s;t would give to his patient,
<PB N="416" REF="426">and to all the family, the degree of &s;trength nece&s;&s;ary to the occa&s;ion."&mdash;"Meanwhile," an&s;wered the colonel, rejoiced at this intelli|gence, "as you mu&s;t know, Henry has been hurried back to the Bury by Partington, the limits of our poor pri&s;oners at the abbey may be enlarged; and to that purpo&s;e am I now going to the abbey; but &s;ince we have met, you, my good friend, will be&s;t &s;ettle this matter, while I return home to make preparations for the general move|ments." The apothecary an&s;wered, that he would lo&s;e no time in &s;etting the cap|tive brother and &s;i&s;ter free, turning round the nimble Bu&s;y, and gallopped back to the abbey.</P>
<P>But neither Charles nor Caroline were in a &s;ituation to enjoy even the ble&s;&s;ings of li|berty. For &s;carce had Henry exchanged the mournful, but affectionate adieus with his friend, in the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, ere the terrified Franci&s;co came to implore the lieutenant to follow his &s;teps; then led him &s;ome paces farther along the cavern, where an object a&s;&s;ailed his eyes, that almo&s;t re|duced
<PB N="417" REF="427">him to the condition of that object. He &s;aw his beloved &s;i&s;ter &s;tretched on the cold ground, and in a &s;woon. Fain would he have numbered that heart-piercing &s;ight al&s;o among&s;t the vi&s;ions that &s;eemed to hover around, but, alas, it was the real Caroline, and the groan which &s;truck the doubtful ears of Charles and Henry, was hers.</P>
<P>Impelled by her apprehen&s;ions on the de|lay of the lieutenant, and auguring ill from his enterprize, &s;he had impul&s;ively explored the winding paths of the cave, and &s;he reached a part near which her brother had taken his &s;tation, even as the words&mdash; "murdered! Henry Fitzorton! my deare&s;t friend!" were bur&s;ting from his lips. She fell lifele&s;s at the &s;ound&mdash;and when &s;omewhat re&s;tored, finding her&s;elf &s;upported by her brother, &s;he exclaimed, "what murdered! dead!"&mdash;her &s;en&s;es &s;till wandering&mdash;"Your friend!&mdash;Henry Fitzorton! murdered him! it was then a warning voice&mdash;a warning &s;hade I heard and &s;aw in the chapel&mdash;O God! O God!"</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="428">The dreadful image again weighed down, and clo&s;ed every faculty, and again &s;he fainted in the lieutenant's arms. She was deaf to all his explanations. Meantime, Flore&s;co had &s;ummoned father Arthur, and his party to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by them &s;he was conveyed, even as if the hand of death were on her, back to the abbey. In vain did the lieutenant a&s;&s;ure her the words &s;he heard were only part of a &s;entence, the ob|ject of which went to congratulate him&s;elf that he had e&s;caped the dire murder which impended. She was beyond all &s;en&s;e of hearing, and remained &s;o for many hours. At length her &s;truggles terminated in &s;leep; finding, when &s;he awoke, that &s;he was in her own chamber, with her kind attendants, to which were now added both the apothe|cary's daughters&mdash;&s;itting round her bed, and the &s;till faithful, &s;till favoured little Fitz re|po&s;ing on his carpet at her &s;ide, and the lieutenant anxiou&s;ly waiting the moment to explain, the whole appeared to have really been the effect of her late di&s;tempered fancy in &s;leep. "Yes, it mu&s;t be a dream," &s;aid
<PB N="419" REF="429">&s;he, "but the mo&s;t terrible that ever fancy teemed with&mdash;has any thing happened my good friends?"</P>
<P>"No, deare&s;t Caroline," an&s;wered Charles, unwilling to hazard more until &s;he was more able to bear even happy tidings&mdash;"And is all well here, and el&s;ewhere?" que&s;tioned &s;he. "All," replied the lieutenant, "our father mends fa&s;t&mdash;we hope to &s;ee him down &s;tairs &s;oon." "Indeed!" &s;aid Caroline, &s;miling, "and are none of our friends, or benefactors come to any thing grievous?" "None," &s;aid the lieutenant&mdash;"What nobody mur|dered?" &mdash;"Heaven forbid!" an&s;wered the lieutenant, and ju&s;t as he was going to unfold the cau&s;e of her fears, &s;he exclaimed, "Then certainly it was a dreadful dream, and I will try to think of it no more." Burton was of opinion that at pre&s;ent it would be be&s;t to let that idea continue; ob&s;erving, that by the time it was cha&s;ed away by a connected recollection of circum&s;tances, more happy effects would be derived from their de|velopement. This plan was, therefore, adopted, and the &s;everal confidants received
<PB N="420" REF="430">a charge from the lieutenant, not to hint the &s;ubject until, if ever that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, it was brought forward by him&s;elf; and even then," &s;aid he, "father Arthur, or I had better relate it."</P>
<P>The connected recollections, however, &s;oon came to the mind of Caroline, when, at her de&s;ire &s;he was left to her&s;elf: every dreadful &s;ound was repeated to her ear, and &s;mote her heart: "Yes," &s;aid &s;he, "it is beyond di&s;pute Henry Fitzorton is murder|ed! &mdash;and, O heaven and earth! his bo&s;om friend!&mdash;my brother! &s;ome dire mi&s;chance! it could not be de&s;ign! my brother has been the murderer&mdash;it was in that place of delu|&s;ion and darkne&s;s!&mdash;O, mo&s;t terrible to thought! yet, alas, there remains not a hope! it could not be a dream, that, agonized by &s;u&s;pen&s;e, I left my father's apartment&mdash; wandered forth into the ruins, and entered the cave of&mdash;death&mdash;of murder&mdash;murder&mdash; of the noble&s;t, be&s;t of beings&mdash;and, alas, ere this, perchance, of thee poor widow, Olivia.&mdash;Ra&s;h, dreadful deed! and the wound will be mortal al&s;o to him who gave it.
<PB N="421" REF="431">Will Charles put Henry to death, and &s;ur|vive the blow? impo&s;&s;ible! let me not re|proach him&mdash;ah, rather let me try to &s;oothe, to comfort, to reconcile him to life&mdash;to life! and can that be made &s;upportable to the murderer of Henry Fitzorton?"</P>
<P>The&s;e images gained &s;trength from reflec|tion, and from after-ob&s;ervations. She per|ceived the lieutenant a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly waiting an opportunity to unfold him&s;elf; &s;he remarked that, on her ob&s;erving him with unwonted &s;crutiny, he appeared to &s;hrink from her in|&s;pection, and yet that he laboured to com|municate. She found that he even began a kind of tale, and then broke it off ab|ruptly; and although this proceeded but from an ob&s;ervance of his own plan, pre&s;ettled betwixt him and Burton, &s;he referred it all to the one point mo&s;t horrible; and there|upon, not doubting but that her brother was the victim of con&s;cious mi&s;ery, &s;he re&s;olved on her part, not to renew the &s;ubject in his pre&s;ence, but, if po&s;&s;ible, to mourn it in &s;e|cret. Accordingly, whenever a word or look from any of her attendants, or from the
<PB N="422" REF="432">lieutenant, e&s;caped, that might tend thereto, &s;he indicated by an immediate change of di&s;|cour&s;e that it was unwelcome to her: and as it was hence &s;uppo&s;ed to be her wi&s;h there &s;hould be no revival of the circum&s;tances, it was agreed upon by her friends never more to advert to them. But what farther e&s;tabli&s;hed Caroline in her full belief, was the never having &s;een any of the Fitzorton family &s;ince the &s;uppo&s;ed event. "Alas," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "they are all deeply mourning the calamity, and &s;hun, more a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly even than before, the&s;e ever ill-fated walls."</P>
<P>Her former di&s;tre&s;&s;es, acute and manifold as they were, the lo&s;s of her father's love, the di&s;appointment of her own heart, even the untimely fate of her ever-honoured, and lamented mother, all &s;eemed le&s;s heavy to her &s;inking &s;oul than the death of Henry Fitzorton.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he did not allow even this bitter aggre&s;&s;ion to interrupt the duties which &s;till called her towards her father; the moment &s;he could ri&s;e from the room to which her fatal
<PB N="423" REF="433">mi&s;conception had confined her, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her time, as u&s;ual, in the chamber of Sir Gui&s;e. Her cares this way, at lea&s;t, were attended with a &s;ucce&s;s that carried a ray of con&s;olation to her heart, even in the zenith of its de&s;pair. Sir Gui&s;e daily gained &s;trength; a time was fixed for his leaving his chamber, and Burton pronounced that he might venture in mid-day to air him&s;elf, under the &s;upport of his &s;on and daughter.</P>
<P>Penetrated by this chearing information, Caroline exerted her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, not to throw a cloud over this pro&s;pect! Sir Gui&s;e had more than once a&s;ked after the miniature of his injured wife, and Caroline took it from her bo&s;om, and he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips. She led him into her own apart|ment at his &s;trong urgence, and when his eye caught the family picture, he kneeled down to it and wept. He recognized in the furniture &s;everal of tho&s;e very objects which had rent his con&s;cious heart at Robert Ir|win's; the &s;ight of them now excited emo|tions le&s;s terrifying, but more &s;alutary. His &s;eelings were &s;till wounded by reflection, but
<PB N="424" REF="434">not harrowed by remor&s;e; yet he was con|veyed back to his apartment in a &s;tate to move the pity of a foe.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the morning found him again refre&s;hed. In this &s;ituation of affairs, the lieutenant, who had received in&s;tructions from colonel Fitzorton to watch the fir&s;t favourable opportunity, told Caroline, not without the difficulty, however, which the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;uch an idea to his &s;i&s;ter, in her circum&s;tances, would excite, that he had &s;ome thoughts of propo&s;ing to Sir Gui&s;e a change of air. "Indeed," &s;aid he, "I am of opinion, we ought all to quit the neighbourhood&mdash;and an occa&s;ion offers, by means of a friend, for its being done almo&s;t immediately, and with the nece&s;&s;ary caution &mdash;and that carriages have been &s;ome time in readine&s;s:"&mdash;"Carriages!" exclaimed Caro|line. "Yes," &s;aid the lieutenant, "&s;o many &s;ad events and &s;trange matters environ, and are hourly happening in this place, that, methinks, we cannot leave it too &s;oon&mdash;and leave it for ever!" "Think of it, my &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid he, and left her.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="435">If there had wanted a confirmation of the murder, this would have &s;upplied it to the trembling Caroline. "He would fly from the &s;pot where the blood was &s;hed," thought &s;he! Her own blood froze in her bo&s;om.&mdash; "But blood calls for blood," exclaimed &s;he. "Alas! perhaps, my brother's own life is in danger!" Rou&s;ed by this thought, &s;he ran to the lieutenant, and eagerly, yet fearfully whi&s;pered, but without confe&s;&s;ing her &s;u&s;pi|cions, "that &s;he would be ready at any hour, but that if it &s;hould be thought more &s;afe for him to go fir&s;t, &s;he would follow with her father the in&s;tant he was able, and a &s;ecure place &s;hould be found. She &s;poke in great di&s;order, and as the lieutenant was going to an&s;wer, came an immediate &s;ummons from Sir Gui&s;e, whom the me&s;&s;enger report|ed to be dying. Every power of Caroline's &s;oul flew to this point: &s;he forgot that &s;he had another cau&s;e for grief in the world.</P>

<P>THE baronet was labouring under an internal malady, notwith&s;tanding all appear|ances, and though it had not, hitherto, &s;top|ped the great functions of life, had been undermining his con&s;titution by a &s;low, but con&s;uming progre&s;s. After a whole day of compo&s;ure, during which his pul&s;e, eye, and appetite gave, to general &s;pectators, every hope of increa&s;ing convale&s;cence, he drop|ped into a lethargic kind of &s;leep, in the mid&s;t of which he rent the air with the mo&s;t piercing &s;hrieks, &s;ucceeded by long heavy groans that terminated in &s;ighs and tears.</P>
<P>The paroxy&s;ms became more and more frequent, impairing at each return, every power of body and of mind. In truth, the con&s;cience of this unhappy man was arou&s;ed beyond the power of being appea&s;ed by the u&s;ual propitiations. It was the never-dying worm which &s;en&s;ibility of crime had, at length, lodged in his bo&s;om&mdash;and in his
<PB N="427" REF="437">moments of reflection &s;o penetrated and de|voured his heart, that he was, perhaps, in the only tolerable &s;tate when every ray of intel|lect was quenched in delirium. In both the&s;e afflicting &s;ituations Caroline remained a mar|tyr to her vigilance, and want of exerci&s;e as well as of repo&s;e; &s;he &s;eemed, indeed, fear|ful that the &s;lighte&s;t movements might di&s;|turb him. She doubled the carpeting&mdash;in|treated that her brother, the apothecary, and every attendant in their going up or down &s;tairs, might &s;tep as lightly as po&s;&s;ible. With her own hand &s;he once more admini&s;tered his medicines, and &s;moothed his pillow, and the lea&s;t creak of the door went jarring to her heart. In a word, every thing which a good and gentle nature could devi&s;e, did this affectionate daughter practi&s;e in her father's &s;ick chamber; though &s;ick her&s;elf almo&s;t unto death.</P>
<P>At Burton's particular reque&s;t and intreaty, a con&s;ultation of two neighbouring phy&s;i|cians was held on Sir Gui&s;e, who&s;e unu&s;ual calm, and apparent tranquillity, had been
<PB N="428" REF="438">more dreaded by the apothecary than the former violences; the latter indicated, at lea&s;t, mu&s;cular force, but the former de|noted exhau&s;ted nature.</P>
<P>With very little variation he continued in this condition four days; in the progre&s;s of which he exhibited, at moments, &s;uch une|quivocal marks of &s;hame, contrition, and &s;elf-aba&s;ement, joining fervidly in the offices of which the pious Arthur made him par|taker, that tho&s;e whom mo&s;t he had wronged would have felt their re&s;entments buried in their charity. Alas! tho&s;e whom he had mo&s;t injured were, indeed, more immediate|ly under his eye, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly en|gaged in offering to comfort him;&mdash;for Charles Stuart, though le&s;s con&s;tant in his attendance than Caroline, was equally ear|ne&s;t in trying every power to conciliate him to him&s;elf, to dimini&s;h his fear, and enlarge his hope.</P>
<P>But one outraged being there was who had not yet met his corporeal eye &s;ince the arrival of his &s;on and daughter, though in mental vi&s;ion he
<PB N="429" REF="439">had nightly, almo&s;t hourly, beheld her, and while he ble&s;&s;ed her name, he execrated his own&mdash;the intere&s;ting, the good, the lovely and all-forgiving Jane Atwood, a &s;incere pe|nitent like him&s;elf, had not yet been &s;een &s;ince his illne&s;s, though thrice that amiable girl, prompted by the true&s;t goodne&s;s, had been conducted by True George to the ante|chamber, from whence, when occa&s;ion fa|voured, &s;he entered the apartment, while the unhappy man repo&s;ed; then, after gaz|ing until &s;he could endure, for pity's &s;ake, to look no longer, &s;he would &s;teal away, le&s;t the &s;ight of her &s;hould encrea&s;e his pangs; but &s;till remained in the ante-chamber, either until he again dropped to &s;leep, or tidings of his health were brought by the lips of Caroline, or her cou&s;ins, or caught by her own li&s;tening ear. At length the hour of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart approached; but it had ad|vanced gradually, and as it came more near, it moved towards him with more tranquil &s;teps. The forlorn &s;tate, above de&s;cribed, had relaxed its horrors, and for &s;ome weeks,
<PB N="430" REF="440">rea&s;on once more vi&s;ited his mind, which, though the animal frame continued to wa&s;te away, permitted the man, covered with con|&s;cious crimes, to feel even in this world the ble&s;&s;ed influence of penitence unfeigned. The deep-toned groans, and heavy elabora|tions of the breath, yielded benignly to the milder &s;orrow of &s;ilent tears, or of &s;ighs, which rather relieved than aggravated his con&s;cious heart. The death of a &s;inner was coming on, and in its progre&s;s furni&s;hed an important example to the wicked, of ju&s;t di&s;tributions both of reward and puni&s;hment, in the pre&s;ent world. As the fir&s;t months of his &s;ickne&s;s and confinement had pa&s;t in the &s;harpe&s;t pains of body and of mind, in the dire&s;t retro&s;pects of the pa&s;t, torments of the pre&s;ent, and tremendous apprehen|&s;ions of the future&mdash;in the returns of rationality, mitigated only by temporary di&s;traction&mdash;in all the agonies of waking con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or in the no le&s;s terrific vi&s;ions of haunted &s;lumber; &s;o when the mini&s;ters of heavenly ju&s;tice had fulfilled the
<PB N="431" REF="441">&s;terner part of their commi&s;&s;ion, and the heart of this modern Pharaoh was no longer hardened, but melted to the degree of duc|tility that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave the &s;oul alive&mdash; then tho&s;e mini&s;ters, like &s;pirits of mercy, wore to his eye a le&s;s vindictive form, breathed into his ear le&s;s de&s;pairing &s;ounds, and on the wounds that yet lacerated his bo&s;om, di&s;tilled &s;ome drops of cele&s;tial balm.</P>
<P>The knowledge of Jane Atwood having been already his vi&s;itor, had been with-held from him only by the tender Caroline, who feared, from his extreme di&s;tre&s;s on the men|tion of her name though &s;o frequently re|peated by him&s;elf, her pre&s;ence might prove too much for him to bear. At his reiterated and earne&s;t intreaty, however, as well to his &s;on and daughter, as to Jonathan, Jerom, and to True George, the latter ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle for his beloved. Jane Atwood &s;oon made her appearance before Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, who had de&s;ired to &s;ee her alone. &mdash;On her entrance he &s;hook violently.
<PB N="432" REF="442">After gazing on her earne&s;tly for &s;ome time, his eyes clo&s;ed in a &s;hudder of his whole frame&mdash;amid&s;t the &s;hock of which, out|&s;tretching his arm, and pointing to heaven, he confu&s;edly uttered the words&mdash;"Injured being, forgive&mdash;forgive&mdash;and pray for me there!"</P>
<P>He remained in that po&s;ition &s;ome mo|ments, when recovering vi&s;ion, and ob&s;erv|ing Jane kneeling at his bed-&s;ide, complying with his reque&s;t by fervent prayers, in which &s;he was joined by all pre&s;ent, he &s;ignified by a movement of his lips, and placing his hand on his brea&s;t, a faint &s;mile atte&s;ting the action, that he was much com|forted.</P>
<P>He then de&s;ired his children might be &s;ummoned: and being told they were both in the room, he turned his view to the other &s;ide of the bed, and there &s;aw them engaged in the &s;ame interce&s;&s;ion. Arthur and his Indian united their &s;upplications. Alarmed by the tidings of George, Olivia, Johanna, and colonel Fitzorton had followed Jane,
<PB N="433" REF="443">they &s;eated them&s;elves awhile in the ante|chamber, and then entered the apartment. Every eye and hand was uprai&s;ed to the throne of the Merciful; Sir Gui&s;e, after many vain efforts to lift his hands to the &s;up|pliant po&s;ture in which he &s;aw theirs, de&s;ired Caroline and Charles to rai&s;e them; at length u&s;ing all the force which parting life allowed, the dying man, amid&s;t almo&s;t whi&s;pered &s;ighs uttered the words&mdash;"Receive, O God, the &s;oul of a penitent!"&mdash;and expired.</P>
<P>A &s;ilence of the mo&s;t &s;olemn kind, not|with&s;tanding the &s;trong and di&s;tinct intere&s;t in which the event was felt by almo&s;t every &s;pectator, di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;cene; even till Sir Gui&s;e had pronounced the &s;entence that terminated his exi&s;tence: and then, as if by an unanimous feeling, that &s;entence, expre&s;&s;ive at once of the prayer of the dead, and the pardon of the living, was repeated by every one pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ence of mind which Caroline di&s;played in the foregoing &s;cene, exhibited al&s;o that rich trait in her character, which has emboldened us to believe &s;he may &s;afely be propo&s;ed as an example to her &s;ex, in what|ever trials they may be called upon to un|dergo in the exerci&s;e of filial virtue. But to the di&s;charge of this la&s;t duty &s;he was &s;ummoned, in a moment of the utmo&s;t &s;eve|rity; her bo&s;om laboured with a &s;en&s;e of the &s;tronge&s;t evils that could perhaps be inflicted on humanity,&mdash;lo&s;s of the only being who had ever touched her heart, reflections on his &s;uppo&s;ed tremendous fate, the terrors &s;he felt for her brother's forfeited life, and the death of her father.&mdash;The expiring moments of &s;ir Gui&s;e, it is true, le&s;s touched the heart than tho&s;e of his blamele&s;s wife, yet, perhaps, the circum&s;tances of a wicked life terminating in a penitent death, has &s;omething more awful in it to the &s;oul, even than the departure of an innocent being. The &s;everal &s;pectators
<PB N="435" REF="445">&s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible of this. The tutored Indian's earne&s;t prayers for him&s;elf, unmixed with tho&s;e which he offered up after the de|cea&s;e of &s;ir Gui&s;e, were prayers that he might not be guilty of wicked deeds. True George found it nece&s;&s;ary, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Jerom and Jonathan, to convey Jane Atwood to the ca&s;tle; and at length Arthur and the lieute|nant conducted Caroline in &s;olemn &s;ilence to her apartment, where Burton and the phy|&s;icians who had attended &s;ir Gui&s;e, reque&s;ted &s;he might be left wholly to her&s;elf: a reque&s;t which, from ob&s;ervations they had made, was particularly enforced, and in which with all the &s;trength that re&s;ted with her &s;he earne&s;tly joined; a&s;&s;uring, however, her brother as he left the room, but &s;till in a fearful whi&s;per, that the only wi&s;h &s;he now had in the world was, to &s;ee him out of danger. "Then &s;he &s;till labours with that cruel apprehen&s;ion," &s;aid Charles, following the apothecary and phy&s;ician to the chamber door. "What apprehen&s;ion?" que&s;tioned the phy&s;ician. "Tell it below &s;tairs," &s;aid the phy&s;ician,
<PB N="436" REF="446">drawing the lieutenant out, and gently clo&s;ing the door.</P>
<P>Meantime reports were made at the ca&s;tle of the la&s;t moments of &s;ir Gui&s;e Stuart, by True George, to the infinite confu&s;ion of John Fitzorton, who&s;e project to move away the abbey family, was now nece&s;&s;arily to ex|perience another perilous delay, if not to be wholly de&s;troyed. He felt the indecency of hurrying away the children from the remains of their late father, while they were yet at the abbey. For &s;ome days pa&s;t al&s;o, Mrs. Fitzorton had been indi&s;po&s;ed, Johanna and Jane Atwood were, of cour&s;e, con|fined by their attendance at the ca&s;tle, and now, again, the &s;ituation in which Jane her|&s;elf was brought home, alike prevented either from the accu&s;tomed divi&s;ion of their cares at the abbey.</P>
<P>All this delay, however, increa&s;ed the alarm, and confirmed the heart-con&s;uming image that had haunted, and which now returned to the bleeding memory of Caroline; and her pious tears fell in mingled &s;treams,
<PB N="437" REF="447">for the death of her father, and the murder of Henry; and her equal prayers were offered up for the &s;ouls of both. "May the long repentance of one," exclaimed &s;he, "fit his altered &s;pirit for the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety of the other! and may it be forgotten in the friend|&s;hip of heaven, there had been any cau&s;e for enmity on earth!"</P>
<P>But whatever be the &s;tretch of our minds, our frames can endure but to a certain point; what that point is, can &s;carcely be known to our&s;elves, till by many a trial &s;u&s;tained <HI>beyond</HI> what it was imagined we could bear, we feel that neither mind nor body can &s;upport more. The unfortunate Caroline had now gained that point, and &s;he fell into a &s;tate at once ble&s;&s;ed and afflictive from its in&s;en&s;ibi|lity. The intervals of &s;en&s;e were &s;o tran&s;ient, that no &s;oothing idea could be received or &s;afely communicated touching the great objects of her momentary thought. She rambled in wild abruptne&s;s from one point of calamity to another; connected and confu&s;ed her ideas; &s;eparated and mixed circum&s;tances, almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant! She combined the differ|ent
<PB N="438" REF="448">de&s;tinies of Henry and &s;ir Gui&s;e, then &s;tretched out her arms to pre&s;erve her bro|ther. She &s;aw, in the troubled region of her fancy, all the forms of death, and beheld the vi&s;ionary coffins and graves of them all! But this forlorn &s;ituation yielded, and was &s;uc|ceeded by a le&s;s troublous condition; and the ever active Burton applied with happy effect tho&s;e oblivious lenitives which alleviate nature in her extremity.</P>
<P>In the mean time the lieutenant, accompa|nied by his friends, paid the la&s;t offices to his unhappy father; the colonel a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and Olivia, from whom the knowledge of Caro|line's illne&s;s could not be altogether con|cealed, and who under&s;tood &s;he was not able to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the funeral, could not be re&s;trained from attending her at the abbey, while the ceremony was performing at the chapel hou&s;e. Indeed, &s;he had long complained of the interdictions which the colonel had laid on her. She even thought them unkind, and it was almo&s;t in direct di&s;obedience to his coun&s;els, which &s;he had u&s;ually thought oracular, that &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her de&s;ign to
<PB N="439" REF="449">make her &s;uffering friend a vi&s;it of condo|lence. "Shall I continue to ab&s;ent my&s;elf at &s;uch a time as this?" &s;he argued! "If my proffered love for her had ever a motive to &s;hew it&s;elf, it is now, my dear brother! and what has been my motive of forbearance, hour after hour, day after day? a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition, in which I have &s;uffered more from &s;ympathy re&s;trained, than any other cau&s;e. Vain and unfeeling apology! and now too, when &s;he will &s;tand more in need of the &s;upports of friend&s;hip, than at any period perhaps of her life."</P>
<P>In truth, John had not a good plea left, which he could di&s;cover, and was there|fore condemned to add the vi&s;it of Olivia to Caroline, to the other innumerable cares and perplexities of the time. No &s;ooner, therefore, had John, Jane Atwood, and True George, departed for the chapel, than Olivia and Johanna, conducted by a &s;ervant, repaired to the abbey. To prevent the tumult of public curio&s;ity and clamour, as well as to conceal the tran&s;action, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from Caroline, the body of &s;ir Gui&s;e Stuart
<PB N="440" REF="450">was conveyed to the place of &s;epulture, through the pa&s;&s;age under ground. For, although every kind of rumour had gone forth, the one, from its incon&s;i&s;tence, de&s;truc|tive of the other; and although in the ab&s;ence of Henry, or rather &s;ince his di&s;covery of the my&s;teries, there no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted any rea&s;on for the concealment of the tran&s;actions at the abbey, yet the lieutenant thought it be&s;t, for his &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake, to have every thing carried on in the mo&s;t private manner. And thus Olivia and her friend Johanna avoided the &s;ight of the burial preparations, but encountered neverthele&s;s an unu&s;ual num|ber of the villagers, whom vague reports and half-explained whi&s;pers of the thickening my&s;teries of the haunted abbey, and the rumoured death of the pretended quaker, had di&s;tributed up and down the different walks, applying to one another with a fearful kind of eagerne&s;s for information.</P>
<P>Olivia however attributed all this to the &s;in|gle event of &s;ir Gui&s;e's death, not &s;uppo&s;ing but that the my&s;tic a&s;&s;umption either of names or per&s;ons had been removed, or at lea&s;t left
<PB N="441" REF="451">unguarded, for &s;ome time before the baro|net's death. The wandering, and indeed wondering groupes, therefore, were little noticed, and &s;he entered the abbey by the grand avenue.</P>
<P>They found Caroline a&s;leep;&mdash;according to the &s;acred phra&s;e, &s;he was &s;leeping from &s;or|row: the daughters of the apothecary, and both the female &s;ervants, attended her. Olivia and Johanna placed them&s;elves on each &s;ide of the bed, and the attendants were ju&s;t beginning a whi&s;pered account of their lady's alarming &s;ituation when &s;he &s;tarted in her &s;lumber and awoke. To break the &s;ur|pri&s;e of their too &s;udden appearance, Johanna and Olivia &s;haded them&s;elves a moment be|hind the curtains: but a little ru&s;tling occa|&s;ioned by this, induced Caroline to throw back the ob&s;tructions, and &s;he di&s;covered her vi&s;i|tors. It would &s;carce have been po&s;&s;ible to give any two per&s;ons a more afflicting ap|pearance than the&s;e good and gentle beings now wore to the terrified eye of Caroline Stuart. From motives of genuine re&s;pect and good will, Olivia had put on a mourning dre&s;s the in&s;tant &s;he heard of the baronet's
<PB N="442" REF="452">decea&s;e, and had worn it ever &s;ince; and from a motive yet more powerful&mdash;an attach|ment to the lieutenant's family&mdash;Johanna had, al&s;o, a&s;&s;umed the deepe&s;t &s;ables. The un|happy Caroline looked on this as &s;o unequi|vocal a confirmation of Henry's being dead, that &s;he &s;prung up in her bed, and cla&s;ping her hands, implored Olivia to forgive the deed. "What deed, my &s;weet friend, oh! con&s;ole your&s;elf I be&s;eech you. Your Johanna and I are come to intreat, that when you find your&s;elf able you would pa&s;s a little time with us at the ca&s;tle." "Ye are &s;pirits of pity then," &s;ighed Caroline, "who are permitted to come in that &s;olemn form to &s;hew us mercy; but, alas! the ca&s;tle!&mdash; "No!" whi&s;pered &s;he to Olivia, "that is not the place for us; the widowed dove had be&s;t come to the abbey; there &s;he &s;hall find &s;uccour; the&s;e poor arms &s;hall be her re|fuge &mdash;fly&mdash;fly thou bereaved bird&mdash;ha&s;te&mdash; ha&s;te to thy ne&s;t. Yes, yes,&mdash;now, now, thou art &s;afe."</P>
<P>With wild yet tender eagerne&s;s &s;he clung to Mrs. Fitzorton as &s;he &s;poke, and folded her pa&s;&s;ionately yet fearfully in her arms,
<PB N="443" REF="453">"Yet, no," continued &s;he quitting, and abruptly receding from Olivia: "the abbey too is rifled, my poor, poor, father! he too is gone; nothing left here but &s;orrow: but there is a place &s;till where we &s;hall find both the truants, and all of us be happy&mdash;yonder, yonder, yonder."</P>
<P>She drew Mrs. Fitzorton again towards her with one hand, and with the other pointed to heaven. At once incongruous, and con|&s;i&s;tent, &s;he proceeded in this manner for &s;ome time, then &s;unk on the pillow. "Alas!" &s;aid Olivia, "her &s;en&s;es are un&s;ettled, my Johanna; the lo&s;s of her father, at &s;uch a period, when &s;he might have hoped &s;o much happine&s;s from his life reformed. "That, my lady," interpo&s;ed the apothecary's daughter, Sally, who was &s;till with her, "is one cau&s;e of her pre&s;ent unhappine&s;s; but there is another: &s;he has taken into her imagination the &s;trange&s;t fancy&mdash;" "Hark! Sally," exclaimed the other daughter, "did you not hear a great noi&s;e?"</P>
<P>Olivia and Johanna were trying to recover, or rather watching the recovery of Caroline,
<PB N="444" REF="454">who had fallen into a &s;woon, and they &s;eemed to have no ear or eye for any other object. "No, Sally, I heard nothing," an&s;wered the other daughter. "There, again!" cried Sally.</P>
<P>"Yes, I heard it then." "Good God! what a &s;hriek!" &s;aid one of the female at|tendants. "Is there any body below?" que&s;tioned Johanna, then fir&s;t hearing the noi&s;e.</P>
<P>"Only my fellow-&s;ervant, who is gone down to the old cook for candles: we &s;hould have fetched them before but that the moon &s;hone &s;o bright, and my lady always bids us let &s;ome of the moon-light come into her chamber, e&s;pecially &s;ince &s;he has been ill; though I always think it is not good for any body, as the moon is but a melancholy com|panion unle&s;s a per&s;on is very happy; and then it's worth all the lights." "Hu&s;h, I &s;urely heard a foot-&s;tep," &s;aid Johanna. "O it is nothing but the dog, mi&s;s, little old Fitz; &s;ee there is his &s;hadow on the wall, he is coming round to his carpet." "All is &s;till now," &s;aid the remaining attendant; "I will
<PB N="445" REF="455">venture to go down. But if one of the &s;trange &s;ights and &s;ounds &s;hould be going about"&mdash;&s;tepping back. "What can that be at one of the windows? this which is left open neare&s;t the bed," a&s;ked Johanna with &s;ome emotion.</P>
<P>Every one but Olivia ob&s;erved the object. It was palpably that of figure looking into the room, from the other &s;ide of the window &mdash;a human face was vi&s;ibly pre&s;&s;ing the gla&s;s &mdash;and after examining the objects in the chamber, for &s;ome time, part of another figure was &s;een at the farther end of the &s;ame window&mdash;the only one not &s;hut to&mdash;and then every ray of light from the moon was in a moment extingui&s;hed. "Heaven!" exclaimed Olivia, turning from Caroline, "What, my dear Johanna, can thus darken the room all of a &s;udden? I can no longer &s;ee a feature of Caroline's face, and, me|thought, her colour was ju&s;t returning." The whole company were too much terri|fied to reply.</P>
<P>"The &s;ervant is now coming with a can|dle," &s;aid Johanna, "all will be well&mdash;do
<PB N="446" REF="456">not &s;eem alarmed&mdash;we &s;hall di&s;turb Caroline." The door of the ante-chamber was left half open, and a light, from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, gleamed from it; but the light did not advance, and the door being &s;uddenly drawn to, almo&s;t &s;hut out of the chamber the faint &s;parks which had appeared. A whi&s;per|ing of different voices en&s;ued&mdash;the voices &s;topped&mdash;the door of the ante-chamber again half opened, and a figure, folded up in a tattered dre&s;s, came gliding into the room, with a light that flung a gha&s;tly hue on the countenance of the per&s;on who bore it, and on the &s;urrounding objects, as from a candle burning in the &s;ocket. With &s;tealing &s;teps the figure paced round the chamber, examin|ing in its way every part of the furniture&mdash; then walked to the head of the bed, holding up the flaring light to every countenance&mdash; it then went back with like care, but with more precipitation; and had &s;carce regained the ante-chamber before the light went out. Olivia, with great &s;trength of mind, had enjoined the attendants to &s;ilence on the fir&s;t appearance of alarm; ob&s;erving, that the
<PB N="447" REF="457">life as well as the rea&s;on of Caroline depended on it; and partly from love&mdash;partly from fear &mdash;they had hitherto obeyed.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this total darkne&s;s, more di&s;tinct &s;ounds, and particularly what follows, a&s;&s;ailed their ears:&mdash;"Now, now&mdash;or never. Our principal mark is in bed fa&s;t a&s;leep."</P>
<P>This changed the terrors which had before been excited on the old notion of the abbey being haunted by evil &s;pirits, into a no le&s;s dread of its being infe&s;ted by robbers. The words which, after a &s;hort pau&s;e &s;ucceeded, appeared to put this opinion beyond a doubt: "The window which was open is covered, and all are &s;ecured below&mdash;I tell you the re&s;t are gone to the chapel. We have brought round two of the hor&s;es into the fore&s;t within a few &s;teps of the lane that goes round to the road. We can wrap the woman in the blankets, and then the way is all clear before us. What a plague are you afraid of then? Here are the other gags. If you dally any longer, I will call up &s;ome of the others." A dreadful &s;ilence remained. In the next in&s;tant it was broken by a &s;udden
<PB N="448" REF="458">uproar of confu&s;ed &s;ounds from below, ac|companied by a cry of "Seize, &s;eize the ruffians&mdash;&s;ecure them for ju&s;tice&mdash;but &s;hed no blood." A number of &s;teps were then heard upon the &s;tairs, and a murmur of voices was re&s;umed in the ante-chamber. Pre&s;ently ru&s;hed two per&s;ons from thence into the bed-room, crying to each other "The window&mdash;the window&mdash;no way but the window&mdash;your cur&s;ed delay has ruined all."</P>
<P>In&s;tantly the ca&s;ement was forced open, the cloth which had been &s;pread over it torn away, and the moon-beams which thence fell on the chamber, di&s;covered the ragged figure they had before &s;een, with his companion in like &s;habby habiliments, de&s;perately attempt|ing to throw them&s;elves out. One &s;ucceeded. Three other per&s;ons coming into the room, one of them ran to the window, and telling the &s;econd fugitive that death would be the con|&s;equence of the lea&s;t noi&s;e, while in that apartment, he was conducted back into the ante-chamber. The other two who had en|tered, went towards the bed, on or near which
<PB N="449" REF="459">every one had remained, in almo&s;t breathle&s;s con&s;ternation. "Fear nothing," whi&s;pered one of the per&s;ons, in accents well calculated to in&s;pire courage, though there was now &s;o violent a tumult of voices from below &s;tairs, the &s;oothing &s;ounds were &s;carcely audi|ble. The per&s;on, however, who had led off the &s;econd culprit, now coming up &s;oftly with a light, di&s;covered, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of every one pre&s;ent, the faces of Partington and Henry Fitzorton, in tho&s;e who had ad|vanced to the bed, and that of Flore&s;co in the bearer of the light. So &s;uddenly, unex|pectedly, momentous, however, and under &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances, did the&s;e make their appearance, that it &s;eemed but a con|tinuation of the former my&s;teries&mdash;a comple|tion, indeed, of the magic by the entrance of &s;ome benign Genii, on the departure of evil &s;pirits. Every thing above &s;tairs, and below, &s;till precluded explanation. Joy, &s;orrow, hope, fear, characterized the mo|ment, and di&s;tingui&s;hed it by all the&s;e blended pa&s;&s;ions, from every other in the lives of either of the parties then in the chamber.
<PB N="450" REF="460">Henry and his friends, guided &s;urely by Pro|vidence, came, like guardian angels, to &s;ave the wife who was folding him in her arms&mdash; the mother of his children&mdash;the betrothed bride of his bo&s;om friend&mdash;and Caroline Stuart!&mdash;from the horrid machinations of midnight ruffians&mdash;the noble-minded, yet humble orphan of a burning &s;oil&mdash;one of the beings whom chri&s;tian ma&s;ters con&s;ider as the bea&s;ts of the field&mdash;as an article of &s;lavery and of &s;ale, was appointed to become an active in&s;trument in this pre&s;ervation by the power, who in a yet more glorious in&s;tance, even the redemption of the world, cloathed the redeemer with humility.</P>
<P>But to Caroline Stuart, how &s;hall even this immediate interpo&s;ition of heaven be extended?</P>
<P>Neither the tumultuous &s;cenes from below, nor the fearful &s;ounds or &s;ights in her own apartment, had reached her ear or unfolded her eye; nor had &s;he, indeed, moved &s;ince &s;he fell into &s;udden &s;leep. "Alas! it is the &s;leep of the grave," &s;ighed Olivia, to whom even her hu&s;band was now, from the fir&s;t mo|ment of her heart's election, the only &s;econd
<PB N="451" REF="461">object of her attention. Every thought and every emotion went to Caroline. "O God! God! &s;he is dead&mdash;&s;he is dead!" ejaculated Henry: his accents at once frantic and im|pa&s;&s;ioned, although demanded by the occa|&s;ion, terrified all pre&s;ent. "Ah! no," ex|claimed Johanna, "ble&s;&s;ed be God, not dead, I felt her breath, this in&s;tant, on my lips." "O heavens! I hear it too," &s;aid Olivia, "hu&s;h&mdash;hu&s;h, my love&mdash;do as I have done. Henry&mdash;thus&mdash;&s;oftly&mdash;and you may hear it too." Olivia guided the ear of Henry, till it pre&s;&s;ed on Caroline's lips, and after the &s;ilence of a moment, in which breath &s;eemed to have for&s;aken the li&s;tening band, "No! no!" groaned Henry, "I hear it not; never &s;hall tho&s;e lips be animated more!" "But an in&s;tant ago there was life on them," &s;aid Johanna: "And &s;o there is now&mdash;again&mdash;again I felt it on mine," cried Olivia. She importuned her hu&s;band to be convinced, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to place his face towards that of Caroline, in the manner &s;he had done her own, he &s;en&s;ibly felt the irre|gular, but palpable breathing of her he
<PB N="452" REF="462">mourned, on his cheek; and while he yet remained in that po&s;ition, the breath gained a little acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength; and, before he changed his po&s;ture, had acquired the force of a &s;igh. "Yes, there can be no doubt of it, &s;he is alive!" cried Henry, enraptured; withdrawing from the bed and falling on his knees, in gratitude to heaven. Little Flore&s;co followed his example, repeating "Him is alive! him is alive! Negro boy was praying God to take hims own poor &s;elf, and put him in grave, and bring back good &s;pirit of good lady, to make all good peoples happy&mdash;but him is alive."</P>
<P>In the highe&s;t fervor of the&s;e extacies of our &s;able &s;on of nature, indeed on the fir&s;t mention of life remaining in Caroline, Part|ington had hurried down &s;tairs, but now re|turned with Burton, John Fitzorton, the lieu|tenant, father Arthur, and &s;everal others whom he met, in his headlong cour&s;e for a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, coming from the chapel.</P>
<P>A new &s;cene of wonders now opened on the eyes of all the la&s;t comers, except Partington, who encountering his friends near the gates of
<PB N="453" REF="463">the ca&s;tle, and &s;urrounded by half the vil|lagers of both pari&s;hes, all in much di&s;order, &s;poke only to the apothecary on the one, then mo&s;t alarming, &s;ubject, Mi&s;s Stuart's illne&s;s; &s;o that to many of them, the colonel in particular, Partington him&s;elf, even before they reached the abbey, was an object of amazement; yet on that object which in a manner annihilated the re&s;t&mdash;on Caroline Stuart&mdash;every other &s;urprize and every other care, while Olivia related the &s;tory of the events &s;ince her arrival with Johanna, which &s;he detailed with afflictive accuracy, became &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P>The apothecary at the end of the narra|tive que&s;tioned his elde&s;t daughter, whether &s;he had attended to his orders in giving the draughts regularly, both as to times and proportions? She a&s;&s;ured him &s;he had ad|mini&s;tered them every two hours, not only before he went to the funeral, but for the whole of the preceding day; that none of them produced the compo&s;ure either of mind or body her father had expected as their re|&s;ult;&mdash;for that his patient had not clo&s;ed her
<PB N="454" REF="464">eyes till after every power of &s;peech and of motion was taken from her, by the vio|lent exertions of both, and that the la&s;t draught having been offered and accepted about a quarter of an hour before &s;he fell a&s;leep, &s;he had apprehended in her own mind, that it had proved too &s;trong for her weakened faculties; "but I dare not di&s;clo&s;e my fears to any one, my dear father," &s;aid &s;he, "becau&s;e, I am &s;ure, let what will come of it, you meant it to do her good."</P>
<P>"No harm can come of it,&mdash;and in the end it will do her good, child," an&s;wered the apothecary, firmly.&mdash;"Its &s;trength has produced on her weakne&s;s, it is true, the alarming effects you have noticed, and in a degree far beyond my expectation, owing to the un&s;ettled &s;tate of her mind and &s;en&s;es, and the &s;ight of per&s;ons and things, which, in that &s;tate, every object aggravates; the medicine was intended to act as anodyne, and I had judged a &s;mall addition to its opiate quality proper to be infu&s;ed on this day, le&s;t any account of, or reflection upon, the &s;olemn duties a&s;&s;igned to this evening,
<PB N="455" REF="465">&s;hould gain acce&s;s to her too feeling heart; &s;he is already in a re&s;u&s;citating &s;tate, though, perhaps, to you imperceptible:&mdash;but the giving her freer air, and, indeed, wholly withdrawing your&s;elves, will be very pro|per."</P>
<P>Every body retired from the bed, and felt the force of the remark: yet no one &s;eemed willing to be the fir&s;t to quit the chamber. They, however, receded towards the door. The apothecary threw back the curtains, and opened one of the windows which had been clo&s;ed. "I knew," &s;aid he, "the force of the medicine was almo&s;t &s;pent; and that the functions of nature were regaining their tone:&mdash;See&mdash;that faint tint|ing in the cheek, is a good &s;ymptom.&mdash;It might be called by Mr. Henry, the ro&s;e-bud of promi&s;ed return to whole&s;ome life:&mdash; look,&mdash;and that &s;oft dew that you &s;ee on the temples, and which will pre&s;ently over|&s;pread the beautiful forehead, &s;hall nouri&s;h it."&mdash;"O! and tho&s;e &s;weet eyes, which, prai&s;ed be the almighty, are opening their gentle beams upon us," &s;aid Mrs. Fitzor|ton,
<PB N="456" REF="466">"&s;hall be as the ble&s;&s;ed Sun to re|animate her heart and to chear ours!" Henry rai&s;ed his wife's hand, even to his lips, but in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tepped nearer to the bed, that he might &s;ee what &s;he had de|&s;cribed. Indeed, every per&s;on in the room, on the apothecary's fir&s;t remark, had ad|vanced.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of recovery from a partial trance, indeed, by means like the&s;e, is not &s;low: and the effect of a &s;ucce&s;sful anodyne is known frequently to produce not only unbroken repo&s;e in &s;leep, but to be&s;tow on the hara&s;&s;ed body and mind, even in the awaking moments, images and ideas, the very rever&s;e of tho&s;e irritable and pain|ful phantoms, which made the application nece&s;&s;ary. Sounds and vi&s;ions of a lulling, and almo&s;t cele&s;tial kind, follow or accom|pany the fir&s;t movements after the &s;pell, that for a time locked up every mortal power, is unbound; and the charm acquires fre&s;h beauty from our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, when &s;en&s;ibility is in a degree re&s;tored. We &s;eem as it were new born, and an inhabi|tant
<PB N="457" REF="467">of a more delightful world, with kind oblivions of whatever was unfortunate; and &s;weet recollections of whatever has been happy in the pa&s;t. Such appeared to have been the temporary trance, and the &s;en&s;ations which &s;ucceeded it in the mind of Caroline. She &s;aw before her eye the forms of all who were mo&s;t dear to her on earth: but they floated as yet before her intellectual vi&s;ion as heavenly &s;hapes, as &s;pirits ble&s;&s;ed. She &s;aw Henry and Olivia &s;ide by &s;ide, and &s;miled tenderly upon both. She gazed ear|ne&s;tly at the former, bent forwards as if to gain a ju&s;ter point of view, pa&s;&s;ed the back of her hand over her own eyes, as if doubtful of their &s;ight: and then, but with timid advances, extended her arm towards Henry, and, at length, touching his &s;houlder, &s;he drew back as if a&s;toni&s;hed to find him embodied; trembling a moment, &s;he again put forth her arm, and reaching the hand of Henry, gave it to Olivia. "There, deare&s;t brother," &s;aid &s;he, with a faint but &s;atisfied tone, "thank heaven!"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="468">Such of the company as knew not the circum&s;tance of her fatal mi&s;conception of the lieutenant's words, in which number were Olivia and Henry, looked upon this as the remains of her delirium; and tho&s;e who were in the &s;ecret of its import, did not judge the pre&s;ent by any means the proper moment to unfold particulars. John and Burton having conferred a moment, the latter renewed his reque&s;t that the &s;ociety would &s;eparate. "I will agree to this," &s;aid Olivia, "if I can obtain dear Caro|line's promi&s;e."&mdash;"No promi&s;es, &s;i&s;ter," cried the colonel, "can be a&s;ked or granted at pre&s;ent! two importunate me&s;&s;ages have already been brought up by the impatient Partington, who had again occa&s;ion to leave us for another party." John now a&s;&s;i&s;ted the apothecary and the lieutenant, gently to enforce obedience: and though as Caroline's fuller &s;en&s;e returned, and objects and cir|cum&s;tances a&s;&s;umed more and more their real &s;ize and po&s;ition, &s;he was nearer rationality, and in her peculiar ca&s;e, alas! farther from felicity&mdash;the dire paroxy&s;ms
<PB N="459" REF="469">were at an end, and expanding her wide|&s;pread arms in token of un&s;peakable grati|tude for the ma&s;s of heart-felt attentions be&s;towed on her, &s;he &s;aw all her friends, except the apothecary and his daughters, quit the room without &s;eeming to pre&s;s at that moment their longer &s;tay. Her eyes, however, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ettled on Henry and Olivia till they could be no more &s;een. But &s;carcely were this amiable pair out of &s;ight, even while the apothecary had required an audience with his daughters in the ante-chamber, than the female attendant who remained with Caroline, perhaps with imprudent, though well-meant zeal, took occa&s;ion to inform her, in a loo&s;e and de&s;ultory way, of the peril they had all been in, even of their lives; and that in Henry Fitzorton, Caroline and all her friends had found a deliverer. To this officious information Caroline made no an&s;wer in words, but &s;he looked the lan|guage which no words have ever yet con|veyed to the ears of mortal man, in the utmo&s;t felicity of eloquence.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="470">It is from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the inade|quacy of words, indeed, to de&s;cribe emotions of a particular kind, that we have forborn to attempt delineating the feelings of Henry in the above &s;cene: &s;hould there be any readers, we a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves there can be very few, who imagine that tho&s;e feelings were de|rogatory to the character of a hu&s;band, a father, or a friend, even in that hour of trial, will neither do him ju&s;tice, nor reflect honour on their own hearts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>BUT &s;urpri&s;es of a very different nature have been waiting our lei&s;ure below &s;tairs: and which mu&s;t needs have excited &s;ome degree of curio&s;ity in the reader's mind, now it can be drawn from more intere&s;ting objects. The woods of Fitzorton, and the abbey fore&s;t, had been, time immemorial, the &s;um|mer re&s;ort of a tribe of the Egyptian wan|derers; and although Sir Armine did not ab|&s;olutely encourage tho&s;e who attached them|&s;elves to the environs of the ca&s;tle, he &s;uf|fered
<PB N="461" REF="471">them to erect their local habitations in the neighbourhood of his man&s;ion; would in|directly contribute a faggot to their fire, and a joint of meat to their pot, to repre&s;s, and, if po&s;&s;ible, reform their pilfering habits: Olivia and Henry were more avowedly their patrons&mdash;the one would not &s;eldom make up a little bundle of comfortables for their hedge-born children, and &s;ometimes allow them to in&s;pect her lovely hands to read the lines of life; while the former would al&s;o, in his early days, con&s;ult them on the &s;ubject of his more difficult de&s;tiny, and among&s;t other romantic plans had once &s;erious thoughts of joining the train as well to favour his love, as to e&s;cape that interruption to which his rambles around the abbey domain &s;o often expo&s;ed him. But True George was the chief protector of the &s;able band which e&s;ta|bli&s;hed them&s;elves in the Fitzorton di&s;trict; for there were two parties, the one calling them|&s;elves the ca&s;tle, and the other the abbey gyp|&s;ies: and what is not a little curious, they were as much in ho&s;tility with one another as the two hou&s;es to which they con&s;idered them|&s;elves
<PB N="462" REF="472">as appropriate. Had Henry put his project of the moment in execution, he would have certainly attached him&s;elf to the tribe of the abbey, not only from its proxi|mity to the &s;acred chamber of the inalienable &s;ubduer of his heart, but becau&s;e the ho&s;tile parties in all their treaties of peace, or &s;u&s;|pen&s;ions of arms, pre&s;cribed a line of demar|cation which the ca&s;tle gyp&s;ies could not pa&s;s without an immediate renewal of war; yet Henry had been always on good terms with both parties, and &s;o of cour&s;e had True George. The &s;ervants of both hou&s;es would alternately re&s;ort to the different tribes to have their fortunes told; although they &s;eemed in general to give their own oracles the pre|ference. Since Sir Armine's death, however, the ca&s;tle prophets, though patronized for a time by Olivia, were routed by John Fitz|orton, and even Henry yielded to his motive. "Depend upon it, my dear brother," &s;aid he, "&s;ome of the&s;e days the&s;e yellow <HI>pro|tegees</HI> of yours will be divulging more than is agreeable: and although we affect incredulity, when an idea which &s;elf-love, or a faithful
<PB N="463" REF="473">heart declares impo&s;&s;ible, is poured into our ears, it is the corner &s;tone &s;ometimes of a fatal edifice, which jealou&s;y can find materials to complete even to the de&s;truction of the peace of innocence&mdash;I am determined to rid the country of them, at lea&s;t our party, and have no objection to being called cruel on the bu&s;ine&s;s." When Henry and Olivia were abroad, John kept his word in the very next &s;ummer, but pa&s;&s;ed them over to Partington, and not without a <HI>douceur</HI> to reconcile them to the change: and they &s;oon thought them|&s;elves gainers by the transfer, for the merry humours of the &s;quire were much reli&s;hed: his civility to the worthle&s;s, and his abu&s;e of the worthy was &s;oon under&s;tood, and his bounty being ever proportioned to de&s;ert in every &s;tation of life, he bowed and abu&s;ed them into &s;omething like principles, at lea&s;t rendered them a le&s;s criminal race of people, and many of them were not only pen&s;ioners on his poor-ra&s;cal-warehou&s;e, but he would &s;ometimes buy up the half-worn dre&s;&s;es of his poor, but good neighbours during the winter, or exchange them for new articles of
<PB N="464" REF="474">the &s;ame kind, on purpo&s;e to lay in a &s;tock for his gyp&s;ey vagabonds again&s;t their &s;um|mer return to the Bury woodlands, by the &s;ides or in which, he had erected an occa|&s;ional hut to mark any di&s;covery he had made of a worthy trait of heart or character in any of the&s;e wanderers; the nature of the action was written over the door of the building, and a key pre&s;ented to the party for who&s;e u&s;e it was intended, by way of en|couragement. It mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be confe&s;&s;ed, that to &s;tand as a monument of any detected ba&s;ene&s;s, he would order his carpenter to run up here and there a gallows, neare&s;t to the place where the foul deed was com|mitted, and if the offending party had the hardine&s;s to return, or was allowed another trial, a rope was thru&s;t into her or his hand, with a label worked into the noo&s;e, holding out the threatning word&mdash;Beware!</P>
<P>With the&s;e Henry Fitzorton, on his &s;econd forced march to Partington's, renewed his acquaintance. They had ju&s;t then re&s;umed their lea&s;y retreats for the &s;ea&s;on. On the evening of his arrival at the Bury, the leader
<PB N="465" REF="475">of them, with impatient earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;olicited the honour of an audience: this being granted, Henry went up into what was always called by the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion, poet's dormitory;&mdash;&s;acred to the lawyer and philo|&s;opher of the Fitzorton family there were other apartments&mdash;when the &s;ub&s;equent con|ver&s;ation pa&s;t betwixt Henry and the per&s;on who followed him up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>"I am now one of the fathers and chiefs of the tribe, an plea&s;e your honour, who for &s;o many years enjoyed the protection of good Sir Armine, and his family: I lived in, and be&s;ide Fitzorton woods and hedge-rows the be&s;t part of my long life, and have been the better for it ever &s;ince: your honour, and madam Olivia, and &s;quire Clare, all u&s;ed to pay me and mine a vi&s;it, and I love Sir John that now is,&mdash;though he &s;ent us away from our old hou&s;ehold trees, as his good father u&s;ed to call them."</P>
<P>"I remember you, my hone&s;t fellow," &s;aid Henry&mdash;"I remember you came from the abbey-party to our's, becau&s;e"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e," interrupted the gyp&s;ey, "I
<PB N="466" REF="476">could not bear to be &s;heltered by the leaves, or fed by the &s;tolen offals of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, after the good father Arthur had put us in the right way&mdash;and after I &s;aw and heard what the wicked baronet was doing again&s;t his lady and children. And our patron, the &s;quire, of late years can hardly find words bad enough to throw at me when he is loading me with good things."</P>
<P>"And what have you at the end of this preface to impart?" a&s;ked Henry.</P>
<P>"I have to be&s;eech your honour to read what is contained in the&s;e papers immediately," an&s;wered the gyp&s;ey, "and to take &s;uch &s;teps as you may judge proper thereupon; I was ju&s;t going to &s;end to our &s;quire for a pa&s;s to Fitzorton ca&s;tle, to deliver them to you or Sir John, when I heard you were come back to the Bury. Here they are, &s;ir. I have nothing to &s;ay more, but to de&s;ire you will beware of gyp&s;ies, but not to think ill of Blondel Gapper, your humble &s;ervant, though he is one of them."</P>
<P>Gapper, of who&s;e fidelity True George had often made fair report, and of who&s;e
<PB N="467" REF="477">kindne&s;s Henry him&s;elf had received te&s;ti|mony, now took his leave, and Henry &s;at down to the peru&s;al of the my&s;terious papers. They were of a nature to call out his utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and apprehen&s;ion. He judged it expedient to make Partington a partaker of the confidence, but it was with very great difficulty he could be prevented from return|ing home before the &s;quire had di&s;covered the cau&s;e of his impatience: the in&s;tant, however, it was di&s;covered, he concurred not only in thinking the impatience warrant|ed, but contributed all his own impetuous powers could &s;upply to give it new force. "We mu&s;t be off again directly," &s;aid Par|tington to Mrs. Herbert&mdash;"I mu&s;t leave the&s;e young villains"&mdash;meaning Carry and little John, "in your care, Mrs. Worthle&s;s, until we come to you again, or &s;end for you to Fitzorton."</P>
<P>Vehement as were the agitations of Henry, they were le&s;s violent than tho&s;e of Parting|ton on this occa&s;ion: though both were &s;o bu&s;ied, hand, foot, and voice&mdash;now in the man&s;ion, now in the &s;table, now in the
<PB N="468" REF="478">out-hou&s;es, driving every &s;ervant before them, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to collect every weapon of attack and defence upon the premi&s;es, from the fire-arms in the life-and-death-room, as the &s;quire had bapti&s;ed it, to the &s;pades and mattocks in the garden-hou&s;e, and crouding them all in Henry's own coach, which &s;till remained, and into all the carriages of the Bury, that a &s;pectator not in their &s;ecret would either have deemed them both &s;eized with &s;udden madne&s;s, or that they were arming to defend an invaded country. Even the &s;ervants, albeit in the practice of flying at the word of command, and inured to extraordinary expeditions, had never &s;een their &s;quire in &s;uch a fury of preparation be|fore. One of them was di&s;patched to the gyp&s;ey chief, to attend at the Bury that moment with the witne&s;s he mentioned; and when they appeared to the &s;ummons, Par|tington abu&s;ed them as if they were two of the plagues of Egypt, ki&s;&s;ed their di&s;colour|ed hands with more devotion than he would have done tho&s;e of Cleopatra, the queen of
<PB N="469" REF="479">their country, and gave Blondel the com|mand of one of the armed chariots, ordered him to &s;hut up the per&s;on who was one of his tribe in the &s;ame vehicle, and then fol|low the lead. Mrs. Herbert alone was made, in part, confidential; and her conduct thereupon &s;o gratified the &s;quire, that he regretted the young knaves, Henry's chil|dren, mu&s;t have a &s;he-thing to &s;uperintend them, ms;ince he was &s;ure, from the manner in which that hu&s;&s;ey, mother Herbert, had put a blunderbu&s;s, and one of the broad-&s;words into the carriage, &s;he would &s;lice off an ho|ne&s;t gentleman's head as neatly as any of tho&s;e old tygre&s;&s;es, Boadicea, Zenobia, or Joan of Arc.</P>
<P>In this manner did they return to Fitz|orton, taking up the turnpike-man by the way. They found the ca&s;tle almo&s;t emptied of its inhabitants. One of the few &s;ervants, however, who remained at home, told them the family were gone to the burial of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart; they therefore continued their route directly to the abbey, for who&s;e late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the chapel bell &s;truck on
<PB N="470" REF="480">their ear as they were pa&s;&s;ing, but their eyes were yet more &s;orcibly impre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ight of tho&s;e villagers whom Olivia and Johanna had &s;een &s;cattered about, but who had di&s;per&s;ed until recalled in greater mul|titudes by the few who dared to penetrate &s;o far as the chapel, into which they pro|te&s;ted they had &s;een enter a coffin, which &s;everal pre&s;ent had a&s;&s;ured them, contained the dead body of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, and that they moreover beheld his &s;on, the lieutenant, and Sir John Fitzorton, True George, and many others whom they knew, walking, all alive, as mourners behind, and good father Arthur, the popi&s;h prie&s;t, before it, with a book in one hand, and a light in the other.</P>
<P>This relation, which was regarded as at the top of all the miraculous things that had over-&s;hadowed the abbey, the fore&s;t, and the whole pari&s;h, re-a&s;&s;embled them; until encouraged by each other, they re&s;olved to &s;ee whether the whole was vi&s;ionary or real: for although the majority determined in fa|vour of the popular &s;uper&s;tition, the credit
<PB N="471" REF="481">given to &s;ome of tho&s;e who made their re|ports from the chapel-hou&s;e, among&s;t whom was the landlord of the Fitzorton arms, who received his intelligence from the young &s;exton, no incon&s;iderable number were of opinion they had all along been deluded by their fears, as to the objects they had them|&s;elves &s;een, or thought they &s;aw. A large body of the ru&s;tics, therefore, were &s;pirited up by the power of numbers, though one among&s;t them, with &s;ome tremor, remarked, that a &s;ingle gho&s;t would put to the route a whole army, though it were but the gho&s;t of a &s;ucking child; and they took courage to move even to the abbey door, which they reached in the very moment that a violent &s;hriek, which was followed by cries of mur|der, were heard by the party within. The blood of tho&s;e who were gathered together without, curdled at the &s;ound: yet terrifying as it was, the &s;hriek was too palpably hu|man, and female, for any that wore the forms of men to fly from: their apprehen|&s;ions for them&s;elves were ab&s;orbed in that great principle of nature, which at once di&s;|tingui&s;hes
<PB N="472" REF="482">and protects humanity: in&s;tead of receding they pu&s;hed onward, and finding the inner doors fa&s;tened, they were in the act of bur&s;ting them open, when Partington and his cavalcade, with Henry Fitzorton, arrived.</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;i&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;t us, my friends!" exclaimed Henry, with a voice almo&s;t of madne&s;s,&mdash; "A&s;&s;i&s;t us in the prevention of dreadful horrors&mdash;of inhuman murders! now, even now, committing within that hou&s;e!" In a moment the furious attack was made by the multitude, led on by Henry and Partington, and the abbey was filled with the defenders of innocence! A gang of infamous ruffians were thus, in an in&s;tant, detected and &s;ecured. It was, at once, the cri&s;is both of danger and of delivery. To reach that cri&s;is, had been the wily labour of con&s;piring villany for many months; but to render the con|&s;piracy abortive, and involve the con&s;pira|tors, even in their own &s;nare, was the at|chievement only of a few minutes. Such is the toil by which human machinations are conducted, and &s;uch the facility with which
<PB N="473" REF="483">the hand of Providence reveals and over|throws them.</P>
<P>As Henry led his wife and Johanna down &s;tairs, Partington was di&s;covered at the head of his myrmidons, &s;tanding over their bound captives; but the conquerors were &s;o numer|ous, that nothing could be &s;een but them|&s;elves. At the &s;ight, however, of the re&s;cued Olivia, and her friends, the victors &s;ent forth an univer&s;al &s;hout of triumph. This gave John an opportunity to thank them for their zeal, but to ob&s;erve, at the &s;ame time, that much of its good effect would be counter|acted if they &s;uffered even their exultation at pre&s;ent to di&s;turb Mi&s;s Caroline Stuart, whom they had helped to defend, intimating, that &s;he was under many alarms already, and not in a &s;tate to hear them accounted for. The very name of Caroline Stuart, combined with ill health, but yet &s;oothing them into the certainty of her being alive and once more at the abbey&mdash;that Caroline, whom they had &s;o often found a mediator, and a friend, to the utmo&s;t extent of her humble power&mdash;
<PB N="474" REF="484">&s;ilenced them like the operation of &s;ome &s;udden charm, and they uttered their hone&s;t wi&s;hes and thank&s;givings only in whi&s;pers. Henry had, in the meanwhile, on a hint from the colonel, placed Olivia and Johanna in his own coach, which had &s;o recently arrived from the Bury, ob&s;erving to his wife, that Partington and John would take care of the banditti whom they had happily di&s;covered, and "it is no time for you, my love," &s;aid he, ordering the coachman to drive home,&mdash; "to hear the particulars of a ne&s;t of ruf|fians." &mdash;"Nor do I wi&s;h it," an&s;wered &s;he; "a thou&s;and thanks for hurrying us away from their &s;ight," an&s;wered Olivia; "no doubt, my Henry, but they will turn out very wicked people, &s;ince they &s;eemed to watch a time when they might &s;ecurely ter|rify, and, perhaps, plunder a &s;et of defence|le&s;s women; and when they knew their de|fenders were, in general, engaged in the mo&s;t holy offices. But, O! how providen|tial your return, my deare&s;t Henry! What an interpo&s;ition!" "How was it brought
<PB N="475" REF="485">about?" reque&s;ted Johanna. "And where is my Mrs. Herbert?" "and our children?" demanded Olivia.</P>
<P>Henry, whom a forced marriage&mdash;in &s;pite of the value of the object&mdash;an enthralled &s;ituation before, had involved in eternal re&s;er|vations, managements, and difficulties, was puzzling and hacking at a reply, when Olivia, mi&s;conceiving the cau&s;e of his he&s;itation, exclaimed&mdash;"Good heaven! &s;urely the alarm did not extend to Mr. Partington's! I hope all is quiet and well at the Bury."&mdash; "Perhaps the dear children and Mrs. Herbert were your fellow-travellers?" &s;aid Johanna. "Perhaps they were &s;et down at the ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>Henry now found it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething; and yet finding it both im|politic and improper to &s;peak to the whole of the machinations which were the &s;ubject of the dreadful papers delivered to him by the gyp&s;ey chief, he affectionately &s;oothed the fears of his wife, by an a&s;&s;urance that both their children were well and happy&mdash;that Partington had deputed Mrs. Herbert and
<PB N="476" REF="486">little Caroline to be his hou&s;ekeepers, and little John the repre&s;entative of the &s;quire him&s;elf, till he &s;hould return to the Bury; and that in &s;hort, having very &s;uddenly re|ceived intelligence of a foul con&s;piracy formed by a party of gyp&s;eys, who had an|noyed the neighbourhood of the ca&s;tle and of the abbey for &s;ome time, and were carry|ing their cepredations to the mo&s;t daring lengths as &s;he mu&s;t have heard; it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to Partington, as well as to him&s;elf, to &s;et out with the utmo&s;t expedition to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the complete mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>After numberle&s;s thanks for her hu&s;|band's goodne&s;s, and many apologies for her own impatience;&mdash;"I know not how it is," &s;aid Mrs. Fitzorton to Jo|hanna; &mdash;"but I find it impo&s;&s;ible to be happy, or even as contented as I ought, when my hu&s;band or either of my children are ab&s;ent; and, I fear, I am unrea&s;onable enough to wi&s;h, that whether they were in pro&s;perity or in perils I might always have them in my view, or ea&s;ily within my reach, even till death &s;hould &s;hut them from my
<PB N="477" REF="487">mental &s;ight." She almo&s;t whi&s;pered this to Johanna, but Henry heard&mdash;"And hence|forward," &s;aid he, forcibly, "that wi&s;h &s;hall be gratified! I here pledge my&s;elf be|fore this fair witne&s;s, that when our children return to us, nothing but that dreadful &s;um|mons &mdash;which heaven keep many &s;miling years from my Olivia!&mdash;&s;hall again divide us from the &s;ociety of each other; nor will I henceforth accept a vi&s;it, or take an ex|cur&s;ion of any kind, from which Olivia &s;hall be excluded."&mdash;"Could I have believed," an&s;wered Olivia, "that one of the mo&s;t terri|fying nights, and which threatened to be even fatal, &s;hould prove one of the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed of my happy life!"</P>
<P>Her full heart could not utter more: the re&s;t was the expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence of felicity.</P>
<P>Nor had Henry in his expre&s;&s;ion gone farther than the truth. He now wi&s;hed be|yond every other good to continue the awe|ful duties of hu&s;band and of father; and that tho&s;e might be unbroken, he thought that her guardian eye, and protecting pre&s;ence, would even counteract whatever future events
<PB N="478" REF="488">might happen. Hence he embraced Olivia's idea of a family union, which might keep them all together, even on the night that he had &s;een the only object in the whole world which could render the plan difficult to be realized&mdash;an object which he had &s;een in a &s;ituation every way more affecting than at any former period of a long and eventful in|tercour&s;e. That &s;ituation had, however, lo&s;t none of its intere&s;t, but he concealed the emotions which he could not conquer: he even &s;truggled with them enough to amu&s;e Olivia and Johanna the re&s;t of their way to the ca&s;tle, with an account of Partington's loading every thing and every body with fire and &s;word for the expedition.</P>
<P>Perhaps, under the veil of night &s;ome tears were &s;hed, and the roll of the coach might &s;ink the &s;ound of &s;ome heart-&s;ick &s;ighs, which mixed with, or followed the narration: but, &s;urely, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice or the compa&s;&s;ion either of earth or of heaven to rebuke him for the&s;e.</P>

<P>JOHN Fitzorton, Partington, father Arthur, the lieutenant, True George, and Flore&s;co, were all this while bu&s;ily employed in the abbey. The fir&s;t, in his mag&s;tratical capacity, exhorted the &s;till clu&s;tering but now only murmuring multitude, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in con|veying the culprits, whom Partington had cau&s;ed to be manacled hand and foot, to &s;ome place at a greater di&s;tance from the apartments of the &s;ick Caroline. True George &s;econded this motion; but, as an amend|ment, propo&s;ed they &s;hould be carried to a &s;nug place he knew of in the out-buildings, which Denni&s;on had formerly told him was the abbey dungeon.&mdash;"I know it well," &s;aid Arthur. "It will only be nece&s;&s;ary," re|joined John, "to put them there for the night, as other mea&s;ures mu&s;t be taken with them in the morning: away with them therefore."</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="490">The word of command found &s;uch ready obedience, that had the captives been pigs of lead, they would have been moved off like &s;o many pounds of feathers. Indeed, Partington him&s;elf, his own friends, and the Bury gyp&s;ey, &s;eemed to feel the force, and do the work of angry elephants. The cri|minals were lifted over the impediments which ruinous time had thrown in their way, the ma&s;&s;y &s;tones, fallen &s;tatues, and half-perfect towers&mdash;until they reached the &s;pot recommended by True George, who bore one of the ringleaders on his &s;houlders. It was, indeed, a place of dreadful &s;ecurity, and fit only for criminals of the mo&s;t heinous kind. It &s;tood in the extreme angle of that part of the uninhabited buildings, near which the unfortunate Sir Gui&s;e took refuge from the pre&s;umed violence of his &s;on: no door covered the abhorrent mouth that gaped for the reception of its prey: it was &s;cooped in the form of a well, into which there was no way of a&s;cent or de&s;cent but by means of a ladder, which not even a climbing animal could hope to a&s;cend, &s;o ab&s;olute was the
<PB N="481" REF="491">perpendicular, and had little hold for the feet&mdash;So had it been repre&s;ented by True George, who had, however, the curio&s;ity and enterprize to explore it with a candle and lantern when a boy. The lieutenant, never|thele&s;s, &s;aid, and in which he was joined by both Jerom, and Jonathan, he had &s;een on one of the nights of his own watch, the figure of a man come out of that place, and had even pur&s;ued him; but another per&s;on com|ing up from the cave, clo&s;e upon him, ex|tingui&s;hed the light, and effected an e&s;cape." "I am glad of it," &s;aid Partington, "as the gentry know this way the better if they have been there before; &s;o what &s;ay you to our throwing the worthy per&s;onages in ju&s;t as they are&mdash;they are exactly tru&s;&s;ed for the occa&s;ion&mdash;and you &s;ee there is no ladder now at hand?"</P>
<P>The mob were delighted with this pro|po&s;al, and would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted its execution, without con&s;ideration of con&s;equences, had not John Fitzorton and Arthur repre&s;ented the danger, and the impropriety of &s;uch a proceeding; Partington, however, had taken
<PB N="482" REF="492">out the gag from the mouth of the per&s;on he him&s;elf was helping to carry, "to know whe|ther he wi&s;hed to be complimented with the fir&s;t to&s;s?" making his u&s;ual bow as he a&s;ked the que&s;tion. The an&s;wer, however, to which was, "that he had rather be thrown into hell-fire than go again into that place." "Again! what you have been in it before, have you then?" &s;aid Partington.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the mute horror that &s;at, indeed, on the countenances of mo&s;t of the other culprits as they approached the aby&s;s. "O, any where but there, under or above ground&mdash;you know not its terrors," &s;aid the wretch, who&s;e tongue was untied. "Nay, then, there are good rea&s;ons which we are &s;till unacquainted with," &s;aid Partington, "why this, of all others, &s;hould be the place: in&mdash;in&mdash;in&mdash;with them, my friends." At this in&s;tant Jonathan and Jerom came running with a ladder which they had gone unbidden to fetch, and in de&s;pite of &s;truggles, &s;uppli|cations, &amp;c. &amp;c. the overpowering multi|tude were forced down; True George a&s;&s;erted on his own knowledge, there was
<PB N="483" REF="493">but the way they went in to get out, and that he propo&s;ed to guard, &s;word in hand, until the morning. "And ickle Florrey &s;hall guard too, and the fir&s;t bad mens &s;hall die that tries to come up till good mens give leave." This propo&s;al was accepted: the whole gang, therefore, were compelled to de&s;cend one by one, or receive the &s;troke, which Partington &s;wore &s;hould &s;ever their amiable heads from their &s;houlders the mo|ment they refu&s;ed. Yet, after all, the matter was effected by every violent mea&s;ure but the one threatened. Several of the village mob were earne&s;t for leave to keep Flore&s;co and True George company, e&s;pecially the turnpike-man, but on the colonel making it a particular reque&s;t, they would return home for the &s;ake of Mrs. Fitzorton and mi&s;s Stuart, and not intermeddle with the affair until he had made farther enquiry, and he had entered into a private examination of the pri&s;oners&mdash;they re&s;pectfully complied with his wi&s;hes. Soon after, the lieutenant with Burton and Arthur went back to the abbey, while John, Partington, the turnpike-man,
<PB N="484" REF="494">the gyp&s;ey chief and his a&s;&s;ociate repaired to the ca&s;tle. But early next morning &s;uch ad|ditional di&s;coveries were made, and of &s;o complicated a nature, that John Fitzorton found it expedient to con&s;ult higher judicial powers than his own. All farther conceal|ments were, therefore, of nece&s;&s;ity, given up, and the whole gang of con&s;pirators were fully committed to take their trial at the en|&s;uing a&s;&s;izes. Accordingly they were moved under a proper guard to the county jail, and no other charge given to the friends of the abbey, and the ca&s;tle, than to forbear &s;peak|ing on the bu&s;ine&s;s in the hearing, either of Olivia or Caroline.</P>

<P>MEANTIME, the recovery of mi&s;s Stu|art went favourably on, and by gentle acce&s;|&s;ions of bodily and mental &s;trength &s;he came to a re&s;olution of no longer &s;uffering her&s;elf to puzzle betwixt vi&s;ionary and exi&s;ting ob|jects.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="495">Indi&s;tinct and impre&s;&s;ive forms&mdash;tho&s;e to which &s;he had awaked, &s;till moved before her mind's eye, and &s;he at length demanded of her brother an unequivocal an&s;wer to a few &s;hort and &s;imple que&s;tions. "My deare&s;t Charles, you are not now to learn that my nature always &s;uffers more from conjecture of evil than from the evil it&s;elf; or, rather, conjecture is the greate&s;t evil I can feel. I per|ceive, and I am &s;ure with the kinde&s;t motive, you have all hid from me the one thing need|ful for me to be informed of, yet I have not brought forward the enquiry my&s;elf till I felt, as now I do, the power of &s;upporting its re|&s;ult, be it what it may. Tell me then, without more re&s;erve, whether by any tre|mendous hazard, you have or have not lo&s;t your friend? is the noble Olivia a mourning widow&mdash;or a happy wife?"</P>
<P>"The latter, Oh! ble&s;&s;ed be God! the latter," an&s;wered Charles. He then entered into the explanations he had &s;o long and ar|dently de&s;ired, and which had been &s;o per|petually in check. Caroline fervently paid her acknowledgments to heaven, and chang|ed
<PB N="486" REF="496">the &s;ubject; but the moment of receiving this &s;oul-relieving intelligence, was, likewi&s;e, the moment of deciding on the line of con|duct &s;he &s;hould pur&s;ue. Her doubts were di&s;pelled as to the only point &s;he would allow her&s;elf to a&s;k. The horrible idea of Henry Fitzorton's death, and by the hand of Charles Stuart, was removed. He lived!&mdash;his wife was happy!&mdash;without farther inve&s;tigation as to the &s;tate of his affections&mdash;whether he &s;till loved, or had forgot Caroline;&mdash;what were his looks, or what his words&mdash;how great his firmne&s;s&mdash;or how little his fortitude&mdash;&s;he knew there was but one cour&s;e for her to take. The &s;ickne&s;s of a father, had &s;um|moned her to the place &s;he had long avoid|ed; &mdash;his death terminated every duty which attached to that &s;pot. Henry was married&mdash; Olivia had be&s;towed her pity, love, and bounty on her parent, on her brother, and on her&s;elf. Following, therefore, the &s;acred impul&s;e of an unaffectedly pure and ju&s;t mind, which, when again re&s;tored to it&s;elf, combined pa&s;t and pre&s;ent circum&s;tances&mdash; without proudly or ra&s;hly &s;training it&s;elf to
<PB N="487" REF="497">&s;ee what in heroic conflict it might be &s;crewed to&mdash;an experiment which it is, at all times, rather vanity than virtue to attempt&mdash; without too much confidence, or too much &s;u&s;picion of others, or of her&s;elf, &s;he mo|de&s;tly re&s;olved upon taking the paths which might lead her out of temptation&mdash;the paths which to gain, and to keep, forms the daily prayer of&mdash;alas! daily-erring mortals.</P>
<P>Caroline had not a doubt but to her that peace would be more &s;urely found in the track that led to the &s;oft rece&s;s from which &s;he had &s;o lately been called; and in a con|ference &s;he held with the holy Arthur, the day following that &s;he had with her brother; &s;he explained to him her intentions. She explained them in the &s;acred moment of her religious confe&s;&s;ion; a duty &s;he had po&s;t|poned, till the faculties of her mind were &s;o far recovered, as to perceive, clearly, every object of offence and of rectitude. The monk entered her chamber, and found her in preparation to receive him. In the heart of Caroline Stuart, religion
<PB N="488" REF="498">wore none of her trappings; pure and holy, and &s;imple, it there re&s;ided as in its proper &s;hrine. The tinkling bell&mdash;the illumined taper&mdash;the &s;olemn pealing of the organ&mdash;the my&s;tic murmurs of the prie&s;thood &mdash;and the breath of the frankincen&s;e, had there no &s;anctuary. She rejected not the public ceremonies of her faith, but the per|fumes of her incen&s;e a&s;cended from an un&s;ul|lied heart. That heart required the &s;olace and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one whom &s;he knew to be a &s;incere mini&s;ter of God; and aided by him, her &s;pirit thir&s;ted to commune with God him&s;elf. Yet to the one what had &s;he to confe&s;s, that might not be humbly offered to the other? Before HIM then, who is the prime &s;ource of every other power, &s;he poured forth her &s;oul in acknowledgment&mdash;for the ble&s;&s;ings which, &s;he felt a&s;&s;ured, would crown the death of her father&mdash;for the pre|&s;ervation of her benefactor's life&mdash;for the recovery of his happine&s;s, &s;hould it be yet incomplete&mdash;for the long and unclouded days of Olivia, and of her children&mdash;and
<PB N="489" REF="499">la&s;tly, for heavenly aid in the future govern|ment of her own heart.</P>
<P>Animated, yet tranquillized, by the&s;e effu|&s;ions, &s;he delineated to Arthur her de&s;ign and its motives; but &s;he conceived her return to the a&s;ylum, of which John Fitzorton was the patron, made it matter of right his per|mi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be fir&s;t obtained.</P>
<P>The monk &s;aw into all her motives, im|plied or expre&s;&s;ed, and imparted them to John, with re&s;ervation only of &s;ome ideas that he thought it no way material for the colonel to hear, but which were, in truth, &s;imilar to tho&s;e that lay in the rece&s;&s;es of John's brea&s;t; yet, which in his opinion, as in that of the holy confe&s;&s;or, rather exalted than humbled the character of the con|fe&s;&s;ed. Without dwelling on the &s;ubject, John a&s;&s;ured father Arthur that he would un|dertake to give proper rea&s;ons at the ca&s;tle, while the arrangements were making at the abbey. In truth, the whirl of circum&s;tances had again brought back upon John, perilous &s;ubjects he had &s;o ince&s;&s;antly laboured to keep at a di&s;tance, and he was not &s;orry to &s;ee one
<PB N="490" REF="500">occa&s;ion more pre&s;ent it&s;elf, that carried with it, at lea&s;t, the a&s;pect of pre&s;erving the peace of his family and of his friends.</P>
<P>Accordingly, John contrived for &s;ome days to repre&s;ent the abbey as improper for Olivia's farther vi&s;its; and Burton continu|ed to a&s;&s;ure her that her favourite Caroline was daily more and more convale&s;cent, by which means Arthur had the better oppor|tunity to prepare for the journey, of which him&s;elf and his Indian were to be the com|panions.</P>
<P>The&s;e preparations, however, were not a little ob&s;tructed by per&s;ons of all de&s;criptions flocking to the abbey, to make their heart|felt enquiries after the health of mi&s;s Stuart, and to pay their vi&s;it of re&s;pect to the lieute|nant: tho&s;e pen&s;ioners, in particular who had been bequeathed, by lady Matilda, to her daughter, many of whom were &s;till alive, and the objects of Caroline's undimini&s;hed bounty, could not be re&s;trained from telling their daily, almo&s;t hourly, tales of gratitude, to their benefactre&s;s; and among&s;t the&s;e garrul|ous &s;tories, &s;he found out, what but for them
<PB N="491" REF="501">&s;he never could have known,&mdash;that ever &s;ince her ab&s;ence it had been the cu&s;tom of Henry Fitzorton, to make the tour of the Abbey pari&s;h, on the fir&s;t day of every new month,&mdash;in the manner lady Matilda and Caroline, he knew, had been accu&s;tomed to do,&mdash;whenever he was down at the ca&s;tle; and that the apothecary repre&s;ented him in his ab&s;ence; and when any of the pen&s;ioners were ill, or unhappy, Henry would always bring them comfort, and come and &s;it by, and nur&s;e, and talk to them, till they cried for joy.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, from the unfortunate, but nece&s;|&s;ary, moment of Caroline Stuart's fir&s;t depar|ture, Henry had con&s;idered her poor, as his poor, devolved upon his heart, by a kind of natural inheritance. And while his Olivia employed her&s;elf, in making happy her cottagers, he would take his rounds of benevolence, on the like principle, as the agent of Caroline: and for this to be di&s;co|vered thus unexpectedly, by the very objects of the bounty, was at once delightful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to Caroline. The reports of the
<PB N="492" REF="502">death and penitence of Sir Gui&s;e, and the re|turn of his &s;on and daughter, flew, through the whole country, with the &s;peed of thought; and the tributary marks of loving-kindne&s;s &s;hewn to the &s;urvivors, by all ranks and &s;exes, and orders of religion, retarded the execution of Caroline's de&s;ign: and thus was the ab|bey &mdash;which folly and vice had brought into di&s;repute, and de&s;ertion, and which had been &s;hunned even by the ru&s;tic, who&s;e half-thatch|ed &s;hed was expo&s;ed to all the winds of heaven&mdash;redeemed by the return of wi&s;dom and virtue.</P>
<P>At length, however, a favourable moment occurred; and Caroline with her &s;uite took her &s;econd leave of the abbey; and by the contrivance of colonel Fitzorton, they per|formed their journey in one of tho&s;e carriages which Partington and Henry had loaded for her defence. But it had &s;till been found ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Caroline to begin her fatigues, after others had begun their repo&s;e;&mdash;after Olivia, and, perhaps, Henry him&s;elf, were in the arms of &s;leep.&mdash;Yet, amid&s;t the cloudings of an unquiet night, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the dimly
<PB N="493" REF="503">di&s;covered turrets of the ca&s;tle&mdash;ah! let not the mo&s;t rigid virtue chide the &s;igh, the parting &s;igh, which mixed in her ble&s;&s;ing on the inhabitants! for it was pure, and almo&s;t as &s;ilent as the tear which cour&s;ed along her cheek, when &s;he breathed an adieu to the chapel, where now both her parents were entombed!&mdash;There appeared to her mind little di&s;tinction as to the duration of the farewell, for till her lifele&s;s corp&s;e &s;hould be conveyed to the one, &s;he never meant to ap|proach the other:&mdash;"Never, oh! never more &s;hall I pa&s;s the&s;e &s;acred towers&mdash;that holy vault&mdash;but when I am enclo&s;ed in the uncon&s;cious hear&s;e. Farewell. Oh! &s;cenes of angui&s;h and of bli&s;s&mdash;farewell."</P>

<P>THUS was the ill-fated abbey once more left de&s;olate, although Charles Stuart intended to remain till the family ruins could be put into a &s;omewhat clearer &s;tate, than they were left by his unhappy father; and till he &s;aw what might be the event of a trial, in which his curio&s;ity was &s;ingularly
<PB N="494" REF="504">intere&s;ted. He purpo&s;ed al&s;o, at a proper time after the decea&s;e of his father, to invite the hand of Johanna from the colonel, her adopted father; and, in the mean time, when that amiable girl, and Mrs. Herbert, could be &s;pared by Olivia, his further plan was, to return with them to their in&s;ulated retreat, with a view of affording his &s;i&s;ter the con&s;oling &s;ociety of her accu&s;tomed friends, while he &s;hould avail him&s;elf of John's &s;alutary re|proof in regard to his long-neglected military duties.</P>
<P>If, however, returning clouds hung over the abbey, unu&s;ual brightne&s;s again beamed on the ca&s;tle. Sacred to his promi&s;e, and at length con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, Henry re&s;igned the care of Caroline to the brother and friends who &s;urrounded her, and dedicated him&s;elf entirely to dome&s;tic concerns and to Olivia. Whatever yet remained of his un|conquered thoughts, &s;uch were his actions. In this interval, the hope which his tender and happy wife had promi&s;ed was fulfilled by the birth of a third child, and being a female infant, the mother re&s;olved it &s;hould be
<PB N="495" REF="505">bapti&s;ed Angelica. "You &s;ee," cried John, rejoicing in the event of Olivia's &s;afety, "it was not, my dear Henry, to be a Ra|phael." At a more confirmed moment of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law's health, this was repeated to Olivia, who thus expounded her dream to Henry, mixing in the detail, by &s;uffrage of John, all that related to their &s;ecret tran|&s;actions at the abbey, and their motives, &s;o far as they were known to her&s;elf. Previous to the ceremony of chri&s;tening, Mrs. Herbert and the children were to be &s;ent for from the Bury, and that all might be compleat, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a hope that her favourite Caroline would honour a &s;ecret wi&s;h &s;he had formed, to become godmother of the young Ange|lica.</P>
<P>As the departure of Caroline took place &s;o &s;hort a time before Olivia's confinement, and as the latter knew &s;he was not in a &s;tate of health or &s;pirits to a&s;&s;i&s;t her friend in a moment of &s;uch trial, it had not been deemed proper by Burton to di&s;compo&s;e Mrs. Fitz|orton, by any mention of her friend's depar|ture; but as Henry now looked to the
<PB N="496" REF="506">colonel for the materials of an an&s;wer to his wife's requi&s;ition, John informed her that a change of air and of objects had made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to move from the abbey. "I have a me&s;&s;age to deliver on that &s;ubject, from my &s;i&s;ter," interpo&s;ed Charles, who was pre&s;ent, though Henry was not then in the room; "I will give it you in her words: for indeed it concerns us all."&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;"We are &s;afely arrived at our place of refuge, my deare&s;t brother, and found the worthy Denni&s;on in the perfect enjoyment of his good old age. The rapture of Flore&s;co, is never, you know, to be de&s;cribed, when his &s;imple heart is moved by nature's pow|erful hand. And &s;he touched him mo&s;t ten|derly at the &s;ight of his ancient friend, who was not le&s;s affectionately though le&s;s tu|multuou&s;ly happy. Another ancient friend was gladdened at the view, ob&s;cured as it was, of our good old man&mdash;poor little Fitz: who bore his long journey pa&s;&s;ing well. Father Arthur has &s;pared our veteran the particulars of that heavy event, to which, I feel, I am not as re&s;igned as, I know, it is
<PB N="497" REF="507">my duty to be. Alas! my brother."&mdash;Here the lieutenant pa&s;&s;ed over &s;ome &s;entences in a little confu&s;ion, but &s;oon recovered him&s;elf and went on.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t charge you, my deare&s;t Charles, with an&s;wers to the enquiries, which, I cannot but believe, will be made concerning me at the ca&s;tle, and to explain my wanderings. Let not, I conjure you, the ever-dear and re&s;pected Mrs. Fitzorton, nor good Mrs. Herbert, nor my &s;weet Johanna, attribute my flight to any thing ungrateful or un|friendly. Ah! it has been from far other motives. So far as you know, let me im|plore you to explain them, and exculpate your &s;i&s;ter and your friend."</P>
<P>"It is enough," &s;aid Olivia, "I am ever too &s;elfi&s;h. I ought to repine at what has grieved me, but on the &s;ubject of my friends I confe&s;s my&s;elf a very mi&s;er. I know that the health, &s;pirits and happine&s;s of my Caroline, required a temporary removal from hence, and I yield. Ble&s;&s;ed be her ab&s;ence! ble&s;&s;ed be her return!</P>

<P>IT is become nece&s;&s;ary for us to quit again the innocent, and look back upon the guilty. The time of trial for the gang, which had been fully committed, being arrived, they were brought from the county pri&s;on where they had been &s;ome weeks con|fined in &s;eparate dungeons; and deeds of foule&s;t darkne&s;s, as well as their perpetrators were, at length, to &s;ee the light.</P>
<P>The crimes of this banditti were of a nature &s;o complicated, and private wrongs &s;o mixed with public offences, that there &s;eems no other mode of detailing them with any clearne&s;s, but by adopting the mea&s;ures, and in &s;ome degree the language of the per&s;ons who conducted the pro&s;e|cution, &s;ub&s;tantiated the charges, or brought the trial to i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>"The bill on which the pri&s;oners were indicted," &s;aid the coun&s;el who opened the ca&s;e, "branches into &s;everal counts, mo&s;t of which, taken &s;eparately, are capital, but the leading feature of offence may be divided
<PB N="499" REF="509">into three parts, viz. con&s;piracy, forgery, and murder!"</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecutors and witne&s;&s;es called in &s;upport of the&s;e heinous offences, were &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable men in the county; the per&s;ons accu&s;ed were &s;ome of the mo&s;t daring and infamous that ever di&s;|graced humanity. Among&s;t the fir&s;t, were Mr. Partington, John Fitzorton, Charles Stuart, True George, and &s;everal worthy dome&s;tics from their re&s;pective families; and the gentlemen to who&s;e lot it fell, progre&s;&s;ively to di&s;cu&s;s, and legally to de|termine upon the evidence which &s;hould be offered, were of integrity &s;o unwarped, that, had a friend, or brother, unfortunately violated the laws, and been brought before them, the mo&s;t impartial ju&s;tice would have been admini&s;tered, although their inward hearts might have bled at the award which that ju&s;tice impelled.</P>
<P>The leading coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecution was Mr. Morgan, the honourable man who had been &s;ollicitor to the Fitzortons many years, now advanced to the bar, and whom
<PB N="500" REF="510">the colonel had already employed to puni&s;h &s;ome of the enemies, and to reward &s;ome of the friends of &s;ociety: and the judge who happened at that time to be on the we&s;tern circuit, was James Fitzorton, then arrived at the highe&s;t honour and tru&s;t of the judicial character.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on called upon by Mr. Mor|gan, to give evidence, was Colonel John Fitzorton, who depo&s;ed, that the day after the pri&s;oners were apprehended, he was in|duced to explore the place where it had been found expedient to &s;ecure them. On arriving at the mouth of the dungeon, one of the witne&s;&s;es, Jonathan Arm&s;trong, who had kept watch through the night, made report, that almo&s;t immediately after the raging multi|tude, and the ca&s;tle party, had left the &s;pot, an indi&s;tinct kind of noi&s;e a&s;cended from the cave as of many per&s;ons whi&s;pering, and groaning faintly; but though the groaning kind of &s;ounds remained, the voices were &s;oon more low and muttering, as if per&s;ons had moved to a greater di&s;tance&mdash;that, while the voices were loud he looked down into
<PB N="501" REF="511">the dungeon, and &s;aw a fla&s;hing vapoury kind of light as if in the mid&s;t of a fog, but when the groans grew fainter the fla&s;hing was gone, and only a few mi&s;ty &s;parks were left; that very &s;oon after, all was thick darkne&s;s, and a dreadful dumb kind of &s;ilence has continued ever &s;ince. True George, another of the night-guards, corroborated this ac|count; and added, that as he thru&s;t his body downwards into the cell, he was annoyed by a &s;tench as if of &s;ulphur and other combu&s;ti|ble matter, from which i&s;&s;ued fire and &s;moke; and the muttering groans, which the former deponent &s;poke of, &s;eemed to come from the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and other reports, which had been previou&s;ly made, John Fitzorton further depo&s;ed, that &s;u&s;pecting &s;omething of a cri|minal nature was yet to be di&s;covered, he &s;elected half a dozen of his friends, and de&s;cended armed into the dungeon; &s;everal of the villagers following in de&s;pite of all remon&s;trance: that he was prepared to find, from witne&s;s, brought by Gapper, the bot|tom of the gulph much wider than George
<PB N="502" REF="512">had de&s;cribed it, yet on gaining the bottom, he was amazed to perceive every one of the culprits, who had been thru&s;t into the cave bound, had di&s;appeared. Conducted, however, by Gapper's witne&s;s, who&s;e evi|dence was material, he proceeded further into the cavern, which grew broader at every &s;tep. It was vaulted above and below, but every whole&s;ome breeze ab&s;orbed by a noxious mi&s;t, which clu&s;tered &s;o thick around the lights, and hung &s;uch heavy damps upon the gla&s;s, and horn of the lan|terns, or threw &s;uch an infectious &s;team about the torches, that the guide was often at a lo&s;s how to direct their &s;teps; that &s;topping to li&s;ten, all was &s;ilent; but after moving on a few paces, and then making another pau&s;e, a con|fu&s;ed murmur of voices a&s;&s;ailed his ears&mdash;the &s;ounds &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from different parts of the aby&s;s; when moving onward &s;uch &s;cenes pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the view as augmented the horrors. The objects of his &s;earch were found di&s;tributed in various forms of mi&s;ery. Some had crawled beneath a grating which had been made at the top of
<PB N="503" REF="513">the dome, into which the effluvia of a &s;tag|nant bed of waters, that brooded above, mingled with the polluted air, and rather increa&s;ed than di&s;pelled the poi&s;ons of the dungeon below, by blending therewith the miriads of infectious animalcula that fed on the vapours of the pool. Other wretches, farther on, were extended on the &s;lippery ground, or &s;upporting them&s;elves again&s;t the &s;limy walls, which, in many parts, were covered with concretions of &s;altpetre.&mdash; "We ha&s;ted," &s;aid the deponent, "to re|lieve the victims as &s;oon as we di&s;covered their &s;ituation, but how great was our amaze|ment to find every one of them unbound. Irre&s;olute what to do, we were &s;oon invaded by a &s;tench &s;o deadly that it was with difficulty we could &s;ave our&s;elves from falling; and perceiving that it increa&s;ed as we advanced in that direction, we were bending our cour&s;e another way, when a hollow kind of yell re|called our attention: alarm gave us force, and we again moved forward. The yell now rather &s;ounded like the collected moans of &s;everal per&s;ons dying in agony, and became
<PB N="504" REF="514">more audible. The tremendous &s;mells too augmented, but two of the witne&s;&s;es, Flo|re&s;co and True George, who had fearle&s;sly ru&s;hed forward on the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of the groans, returned with marks of horror that ab&s;orbed the &s;en&s;e of danger: our female guide too had been earne&s;t with us to pene|trate yet deeper into the precipice&mdash;pointing at the &s;ame time to a jutting wall that &s;eemed to be only at a few paces. We gained the wall with difficulty, and it appeared to bound the pri&s;on. Our conductors, however, &s;till pointed forward. The wall was low, and above it a&s;cended a column of &s;moke mingled with &s;parks of fire. The moaning was again heard. Flore&s;co and George con|ducted us by an opening which &s;helved from the wall, and in an in&s;tant we found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of another di&s;tinct narrow dun|geon, but the &s;moke increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree as to &s;mother even the flame that attempted to labour through it, yet a refre&s;hing air &s;uddenly bur&s;t upon our &s;en&s;es, and ju&s;t as we began to inhale it, a ha&s;ty &s;tep was heard, and a voice exclaimed, but as if
<PB N="505" REF="515">ga&s;ping for life&mdash;the pa&s;&s;age is at la&s;t broke, and if we can breathe a few minutes longer we may e&s;cape &s;till. No per&s;on could be &s;een, but one of our friends had darted through all ob&s;tructions; and a &s;hriek, in the next in&s;tant from the exclaimer, announced that the latter was &s;afe in the gripe of Jona|than Arm&s;trong. All ru&s;hed onwards. The gu&s;hing winds di&s;per&s;ed the &s;moke, and blew up the flames.</P>
<P>"But more and yet greater horrors," continued the pro&s;ecutor, "awaited us." A number of per&s;ons were di&s;covered either lying on the ground, or near the fire, as if recovering from almo&s;t a &s;tate of &s;uffocation. Many of them, however, on perceiving us feebly rai&s;ed them&s;elves, and attempted to e&s;cape through the pa&s;&s;age door which had been forced; but George and Flore&s;co ran forward, guided by the draughts of the wind, and intercepted them. Others were too much overwhelmed to attend even to the con&s;equence of detection. One alone among&s;t them, with dreadful intrepidity, &s;at unawed before the &s;ulphurous flame, which, &s;ince the
<PB N="506" REF="516">ru&s;hing in of the air, &s;urmounted all ob&s;truc|tion, and illuminated the horrors of the cell. Among&s;t tho&s;e horrors we had to enumerate the putrid reliques of a human body, over which the flame threw a livid glare, that not only di&s;covered tho&s;e relicts, but al&s;o other mutilated members which were yet con|&s;uming in the fire, and the daring wretch, who &s;eemed to pre&s;ide over the whole, was, at the moment of di&s;covery, preparing to ca&s;t another limb into the flames, and to complete our a&s;toni&s;hment, this fury was a woman. "Alas! it is even as I told your honours," then ejaculated the witne&s;s, who had been our chief guide, and who was likewi&s;e a female. "I knew he mu&s;t die, and now his murderers are trying to conceal the murder." "In&s;tantly," proceeded the deponent; "every attendant &s;ecured one or other of the fugitives, we &s;eized a variety of offen&s;ive weapons, and other in&s;truments which lay be&s;ide them, and &s;urrounded the principal fiend. She ro&s;e undaunted, &s;tood fixed, and &s;eeing us advance kept us a moment at bay, uttering horrible execrations that reverberated through all the windings of
<PB N="507" REF="517">the dungeon. Overpowered, however, by numbers, &s;he yielded in contemptuous &s;ilence: Meantime, one of the banditti&mdash;who was try|ing to e&s;cape, and endeavouring to make terms of mercy with George, Jonathan and Flo|re&s;co, after he was caught, attempted his pre&s;ervation by informing them "the &s;ecret door which they were guarding led to the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, and as he was in the &s;ecret of all its labyrinths, he would have the honour to conduct all their honours, not doubting but they would &s;peak a good word for him &s;hould their honours think it worth while to take any further notice of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s." But the indignant George &s;purning the offer, left the trembling wretch in the cu&s;tody of Jonathan, while he ha&s;ted with the intelligence to our party. Mea&s;ures were hereupon taken to profit by the information; and the re&s;toring air, having, by this time, in &s;ome degree, purged the atmo&s;phere of its deadly ob&s;tructions, time was given us to collect, ama&s;s, and carry off tho&s;e more annoying objects, alive and dead, which, fouler than
<PB N="508" REF="518">the breath of pe&s;tilence, had polluted the dungeon.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances being fully corro|borated by the other witne&s;&s;es, who&s;e depo|&s;itions were &s;everally taken, the learned coun&s;el then brought forward a body of evi|dence that e&s;tabli&s;hed a variety of facts, by which, in &s;ub&s;tance, it "appeared that the of|fenders, who had been long engaged in a cour&s;e of nefarious practi&s;es, and in alliance with each other, had formed them&s;elves into a body, under the a&s;&s;umed name and garb of tho&s;e itinerant cheats called gyp&s;ies, the more &s;ecurely and effectually to carry on an accumulation of delinquency, in every part of which the per&s;ons forming the confede|racy, had a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate intere&s;t&mdash; the whole body being &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to each other, that, although in point of &s;ituation, many members of the gang had been ac|cu&s;tomed to perpetrate their atrocities in the higher, and others in the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of mankind&mdash;a &s;ort of &s;ocial compact was main|tained on the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; for although each wi&s;hed all the re&s;t hanged,
<PB N="509" REF="519">not wilfully to hang one another was an act of policy, &s;ince any attempt to &s;nap or &s;horten the chain which united them, would be but to convert the indignant links into &s;o many halters for their own necks."</P>
<P>But what was the indignation of the court, and of the a&s;&s;embled multitude, when they &s;aw&mdash;and what will be that of the worthy reader, when he finds, that this excavated gang was chiefly formed of tho&s;e depredators and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who were once a&s;&s;ociated with the late Sir Gui&s;e Stuart?&mdash;that the wretch who would have e&s;caped from ju&s;tice, by impeaching others in the moment of detec|tion, was the execrable Nicholas Dabble? and that the chief female fiend, who was found in the bowels of the earth at her infernal rites, was the daring lady Tempe&s;t. "I will take upon me to create a world to-morrow," &s;ays an accurate ob&s;erver, "if to-day I can give rectitude of heart to one pettifogging attorney." And the ob&s;ervation applies no le&s;s to one &s;hamele&s;s woman, when criminal habits and pa&s;&s;ions have wholly extingui&s;hed the moral principle. Yet, even in characters like
<PB N="510" REF="520">the&s;e, the moral principle is not ea&s;ily anni|hilated: its de&s;truction is u&s;ually the effect of gradual crimes. Sometimes, even after a long and dreadful progre&s;&s;ion, the keen and avenging &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, a&s;&s;erts its long in&s;ulted power, and arou&s;es to &s;hame and remor&s;e; &s;ometimes, with accu|mulating turpitude, by continuing in di&s;&s;olute &s;ociety, the internal guard of our nature is &s;o far &s;ubdued, as to want the force of ren|dering either an abandoned life, or ignomi|nious death, terrible to the offender. Of the former part of this aweful truth, the ca&s;e of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart has already furni&s;hed an ex|ample: and the latter will be but too clearly illu&s;trated in the conduct and de&s;tiny of the culprits now under the eye of the reader.</P>
<P>We have briefly to unfold the cau&s;e of this horrid confederacy. Valentine Miles, and lady Tempe&s;t Stuart, di&s;appointed, di&s;graced, and traver&s;ed in many of their important machinations at the abbey, and at the ca&s;tle, their hate for &s;ome of the inhabitants, and their burning de&s;ire for others, &s;urvived all their mi&s;carriages, mortifications, and even
<PB N="511" REF="521">puni&s;hments, &s;o effectually, that &s;oon after her lady&s;hip had &s;haken off her hu&s;band, &s;he boldly and avowedly e&s;tabli&s;hed her hazard, and <HI>rouge et noir</HI> tables, and her pharo bank:&mdash;where contribution &s;uppers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide A treati&s;e on the Police of the Metropolis.</NOTE> and the choice&s;t wines were provided at fifty pounds a route; and &s;he ranked among&s;t her cu&s;tom|ers, and &s;ub&s;cribers, an indi&s;criminate mixture of both &s;exes, from the fini&s;hed &s;harper to the raw inexperienced youth! But, amid&s;t all the &s;plendid plunder of the day, and the &s;till more gorgeous ruins of the night, the flames of vengeance and of de&s;ire conflagrated her bo&s;om: the &s;tinging thoughts of Olivia's marriage with Henry, and of Caroline's decided pa&s;&s;ion for him alone, &s;upplied fuel to the one pa&s;&s;ion; and reflections on her innumerable degradations fed the rage of the other. Her Valentine &s;ecretly &s;ympathized in both: they brought into one point of view what they had &s;uffered, from the fir&s;t outrage to the la&s;t.&mdash;Miles recurred to the bullet of John Fitzorton, who&s;e mark he yet carried in his neck:&mdash;his di&s;graces at the Ad&s;ell
<PB N="512" REF="522">a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination&mdash;the &s;corn with which Caroline received his vows of love&mdash;and the &s;napping of Henry's fingers in the apartments of lady Stuart&mdash;then Mrs. Tempe&s;t&mdash;where he &s;wore that the deare&s;t blood of the offender's heart &s;hould one day repay the in&s;ult&mdash;all tended to accumulate the venom in his brea&s;t. Lady Tempe&s;t, al&s;o, brooded over the contumely &s;he had endured, as well on &s;ome of the above, as on various other account. Foiled in every attempt to embitter the happine&s;s of Olivia:&mdash;her letters intercepted&mdash;her feeble &s;tratagems rendered abortive either by True George, or John Fitzorton, and driven by reiterated di&s;appointments to de&s;pair:&mdash;more particularly &s;ince the colonel's conduct and menaces, at the abbey carou&s;als&mdash;the col|lected poi&s;ons of her fury far out&s;tript even that of Miles; and the &s;avage pa&s;&s;ion &s;he yet felt for Henry, mixt &s;trangely with her un|quenchable and now maddening thir&s;t of revenge, which burnt the fiercer for being long unappea&s;ed. The mo&s;t dire intents, indeed, had been accumulating in the minds of both Valentine and lady Tempe&s;t, before either
<PB N="513" REF="523">dared to confide with the other their foul de&s;igns. But the moment at la&s;t arrived. Both perceived they might communicate. The exchange of one &s;anguinary look con|veyed from eye to eye, and from heart to heart, the dreadful &s;ympathy! An oath of union pa&s;t, as by &s;ecret intelligence, between them, and they read in every feature, without utterance of a word, that the compact &s;hould be cemented by blood. They &s;natched the hand of each other, and, in that moment, the murder of John and Henry Fitzorton, &mdash;and wor&s;e then, the murder of Caroline and Olivia,&mdash;were determined.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret council of blood broke up after pa&s;&s;ing the following re&s;olutions: To remove every ob&s;truction in the way of compa&s;&s;ing the grand de&s;ideratum:&mdash;To con&s;ider every other lo&s;s, gain, intere&s;t, or difficulty, or danger, as &s;ubordinate, till &s;ome of the victims were &s;truggling in their arms, and others laid dead at their feet. In pur&s;uit of the&s;e demoniac ends, the means were propor|tionate. The co&s;t, indeed, would be enor|mous; but avarice was now a &s;econdary pa&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="514" REF="524">Be&s;ides which, the lady's <HI>banks</HI> had literally overflowed of late to &s;uch a degree, that the golden tides of half her ruined friends and vanqui&s;hed enemies, had rolled their trea&s;ures into her hand: and Valentine, in|dependent of his &s;hare in tho&s;e more obvious frauds, had learned the &s;cience of money-mak|ing another way: for with a noble ambition of calling into action all his ver&s;atile powers, and &s;hewing they were alike adapted for the bu&s;ine&s;s of one part, as for the plea&s;ures of the other part of the metropolis, he had recently engaged in no le&s;s than five of the coinages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Police of the Metropolis.</NOTE>, out of near half a hundred, that are almo&s;t con&s;tantly employed in London; and the&s;e private mints had been &s;o produc|tive, as often to have yielded him a thou&s;and pounds a week: many of his fabricators creating, and giving currency <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> to fifty pounds a day, intrin&s;ically not worth fifty &s;hillings. Nay to &s;uch a point of perfection had he ar|rived in this line, that he &s;ometimes pro|cured from the coiners, who worked for him,
<PB N="515" REF="525">from 300l. to 500l. for country orders in the cour&s;e of the week. Mutually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch re&s;ources, the means of accompli&s;hing almo&s;t any evil end were thus thrown into the hands of lady Tempe&s;t Stuart and her compeer. And though their long-conceived hatred, envy, and jealou&s;y of each other, were by no means abated, a common villany now again held them together more firmly than before; and the amicable way in which they carried it on, might have led &s;uper|ficial ob&s;ervers to believe they had always been, and then were, the very be&s;t friends in the world. Dabble, on the other hand, from a run of adver&s;ity in a new branch of atrocity, had found more than u&s;ual ex|erci&s;e for his little niceties.</P>
<P>In&s;atiable avarice was the grand vice of this man's character, and to gratify this in every way, and by every mode, of enter|prize and exaction, had been the ince&s;&s;ant toil of life. But he had been unfortunate &s;ince we la&s;t &s;aw him&mdash;unfortunate in the lottery&mdash;from having been the invi&s;ible pro|prietor of &s;ome in&s;urance offices, for the
<PB N="516" REF="526">o&s;ten&s;ible men of &s;traw, in the &s;hape of receivers and payers, having filled their pockets with the &s;poil, imitated their em|ployer's great example, and became invi&s;i|ble al&s;o. Unfortunate likewi&s;e, in ad|vancing money upon bonds, title deeds, and e&s;tates in rever&s;ion, in hopes of u&s;urious intere&s;t&mdash;and all this hope broke &s;uddenly under him&mdash;then the courts were open only to i&s;&s;ue out warrants for apprehending him, and &s;hut again&s;t him for ever as a practi&s;ing attorney: and la&s;tly, with the&s;e &s;trokes of ill-luck, he had lo&s;t his con&s;equence and cre|dit with my lady and Valentine. Yet the time was now come round when his daily profe&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t as daily rejected, &s;er|vices were again acceptable. Various infe|rior in&s;truments, and &s;ubordinate wheels in the grand machine of the ca&s;tle and abbey con&s;piracy, were now wanted, and Mr. Nicholas Dabble was employed to collect the&s;e. The bu&s;ine&s;s was opened with very little ceremony; and the terms &s;ettled with|out difficulty. He undertook the thing on &s;peculation, and with unwearied alacrity&mdash;
<PB N="517" REF="527">and, indeed, in le&s;s time than it would co&s;t an hone&s;t man to pick up a &s;ingle rogue; or, indeed, reconcile his feelings to look for one, this active gentleman had a&s;cended and de&s;cended into the haunts of as many under|takers as would make hone&s;t men wonder how they pa&s;t a &s;ingle day or night, with|out being a&s;&s;aulted or robbed, wounded or murdered. A cho&s;en band of his old ac|quaintance, to whom he had before given jobs, and whom he knew to be ready for all vicious occa&s;ions at a moment's warning, were mu&s;tered, di&s;ciplined, and trained to action. The troop was rai&s;ed from the fol|lowing per&s;onages, mo&s;t of whom it is pro|bable have a mark &s;et upon them in the reader's memory.&mdash;Fir&s;t, the &s;tump-maker and chum, who &s;ince their bargain with Jonathan and Jerom, had found their ac|count in a&s;&s;uming their own legs, to run away with parcels of which they tricked boys, &s;hopmen, or per&s;ons coming from the country.&mdash;Secondly, the ingenious Mr. Smith, who conducted Sir Gui&s;e to the
<PB N="518" REF="528">hand-in-hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the ill-regulated public hou&s;es, where fraudu|lent per&s;ons find an a&s;ylum to con&s;ult how and where they are to commit depredations on the public, and of which there are 1000 in London.</NOTE>, and who had recently been advanced from &s;tealing goods, as a petty pil|ferer, to opening a hou&s;e for receiving &s;uch goods, knowing them to be &s;tolen.&mdash; Thirdly, Mr. Scuttle, late the waiter at the hand-in-hand, now one of the fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons computed to pur&s;ue gaming as a trade in London daily.&mdash;Fourthly, the lady who acted as foil to the widow, on the memo|rable night of Henry's vi&s;it to the theatre, but who a little before ranked only as one of the fifty thou&s;and females of the metropolis, who are e&s;timated to pur&s;ue publickly their abandoned trade.&mdash;Fifthly, the two loving brothers, David and Gamaliel Otley, who had been in perpetual &s;trife for the palm of roguery; and who had never been able to &s;ettle the point to their own &s;atisfaction, or to any other per&s;on's, &s;o nearly equal were their preten&s;ions: each having with the
<PB N="519" REF="529">mo&s;t laudable emulation laboured to excel in his vocation, till at length both had a&s;cended the climax, from the theft of a nail, a &s;kewer, a key, or a gla&s;s bottle, up to the mo&s;t valuable articles. There were, al&s;o, added to the phalanx, one of the per&s;ons known to belong to the fraternity of thieves, who&s;e depredations are calculated to amount to the enormous &s;um of &s;even hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds a year. There was, likewi&s;e, a profe&s;&s;ional bludgeon man, and an armed ruffian, who are to be hired for any haz|ardous enterprize; the terms regulated by the degrees of danger, expected oppo&s;ition, &amp;c. but who, at other times, a&s;&s;ume the trade of hawkers and pedlars, &amp;c. in which character they only cheat and pilfer, but in their former capacity they are to be let out by their proprietors, of which Mr. Dabble was &s;till one, at &s;o much per head, from &s;im|ple a&s;&s;ault to determined a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. And to clo&s;e the whole, Mr. Scuttle, the new hand-in-hand landlord, who&s;e fitne&s;s for any mi&s;chief that might be coining in tho&s;e
<PB N="520" REF="530">mints of wickedne&s;s, the heads of Miles and my lady Stuart, will not be que&s;tioned, when the reader is informed, that the lottery in&s;urance committee, both agents and clerks, amounting to near two thou&s;and, met twice a week at his hou&s;e; and that the bludgeon e&s;tabli&s;hment had there its monthly club.</P>
<P>But while Mr. Dabble was collecting his daring and &s;trong minded bravoes to cover the retreat, or in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;t|ance to proceed to the la&s;t extremities, Dabble him&s;elf conducting the &s;ecret ex|pedition as general of the banditti, under the command of field-mar&s;hal Valentine Miles and his a&s;&s;ociate, the latter was not idle. One of the fir&s;t loves of lady Stuart was Mr. Thomas, whom &s;he &s;till con|&s;idered as an old friend, and who had been part of her e&s;tabli&s;hment while &s;he re&s;ided at the abbey. He there became ac|quainted with an under groom of the manor-hou&s;e, of &s;uch promi&s;ing talents, that he took on him&s;elf the trouble of training him to rob his ma&s;ter, and mo&s;t of his
<PB N="521" REF="531">fellow-&s;ervants of &s;undry articles, which Mr. Thomas &s;aid he would purcha&s;e; but when the theft was made, and the &s;poil pre&s;ented, he thought proper all at once to &s;cruple&mdash;&s;eized upon the young delin|quent, and &s;wore he would produce wit|ne&s;&s;es to prove&mdash;though no per&s;on had been pre&s;ent at the time,&mdash;that he had offered the &s;tolen goods to him, but that he refu&s;ed to receive them, and only had them in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion like an hone&s;t man, to make di&s;|covery. Terrified at this, being then young in crime, the boy &s;upplicated for mercy, which the tender-hearted Mr. Thomas granted on certain conditions;&mdash;to wit,&mdash; that he &s;hould undertake to tran&s;act any bu&s;ine&s;s he might be tru&s;ted with for any part of the ca&s;tle or manor-hou&s;e families, and as that tru&s;t was faithfully, or unfaith|fully di&s;charged, mercy or ju&s;tice &s;hould be admini&s;tered. The trembling culprit pro|mi&s;ed, and was almo&s;t immediately em|ployed to deliver a letter to Olivia from lady Tempe&s;t, which had it fallen into the hands of the former, would have torn
<PB N="522" REF="532">up the happine&s;s, perhaps, of her whole life by the roots; for it &s;truck a dagger at the faith, honour, and tenderne&s;s of Henry Fitzorton in every line. The letter carrier meeting, however, with True George while he was watching his opportunity, Olivia then being at the ca&s;tle, &s;ome &s;u&s;|picious circum&s;tances en&s;ued, which brought on a di&s;covery; and with this, George hur|ried &mdash;the boy in his gripe&mdash;to John Fitzor|ton, who affected to chide George for &s;topping a &s;ervant in di&s;charge of his duty, &s;aid the letter &s;hould be taken care of, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the boy, only de&s;iring him to deliver future pre&s;ents either to him or George, and that for every &s;uch pacquet he &s;hould receive a gratuity. The boy pro|mi&s;ed, and kept his word, being well paid by both parties, without &s;aying a word of his double dealing to either. George thought it &s;trange, till the colonel explained; and thus was Olivia's peace pre&s;erved from a train of evils, with jealou&s;y, the hydra, at their head. But this boy advanced too rapidly in the furtive profe&s;&s;ion which Mr.
<PB N="523" REF="533">Thomas had taught him, and was &s;ent away in di&s;grace. Mr. Thomas him&s;elf was expel|led &s;oon after, when the abbey arrange|ments broke up; but he was fated to great preferment, as keeper of a Regi&s;ter-office, and there his old friend the &s;table-boy came, after many other di&s;graces, to look for a place. The banditti plan was then beginning to form. Thomas &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing he had the boy on the hip, recommended him to lady Tempe&s;t; he was &s;oon after enrolled among&s;t the con|&s;pirators, for his brilliant &s;ugge&s;tions of the gyp&s;ey plan,&mdash;the &s;ubterraneous cavern,&mdash; and an a&s;&s;ertion that he knew &s;ome of tho&s;e who had really been among&s;t the abbey tribe. "They are now clippers and coiners," &s;aid the boy; "no longer ago than ye&s;terday, one of them told me my fortune, which was, that I &s;hould &s;oon again &s;ee the old abbey,&mdash;and ecod, if we go upon this expedition the fortune will come true, you know, Mr. Thomas." In pur&s;uance of his promi&s;e, he introduced the <HI>ci-divant</HI> gyp&s;ies to Miles and my lady, the
<PB N="524" REF="534">former of whom recognized five of his money-makers, four of whom were delighted at the thought of another frolic to the abbey, a&s;&s;erting that they could carry on part of their new employment as well in one place as another,&mdash;under ground as above ground,&mdash;in town or country,&mdash;and that they would undertake not only to bring back the gyp&s;ey complexion into their own faces, but to tinge every other, as well as dre&s;s up all the characters in the true gyp&s;ey &s;tyle, &s;o as to make it impo&s;&s;ible for parents to know their children, or children their parents, be&s;ides teaching the occult &s;cience, and all the cant of the profe&s;&s;ion, concluding with the following declaration:&mdash;"That they owed John Fitzorton and True George a grudge for &s;ome rigorous acts of the former, con&s;equent on the reports of the latter, and would a&s;&s;i&s;t in the de&s;truction of both with all their hearts and &s;ouls." The fifth was a very young creature, and followed her a&s;&s;ociates reluctantly.</P>
<P>The full complement of con&s;pirators was now obtained, and with the different im|plements
<PB N="525" REF="535">of their different trades and &s;tra|tagems, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the very &s;econd|hand cloathes-merchant who &s;upplied Sir Gui&s;e Stuart with his quaker apparel, and properly &s;tained, they &s;et forward. They &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the abbey-woods without oppo&s;ition. They had previou&s;ly gained intelligence of Sir Gui&s;e and the return of the whole abbey party, and found means to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the exact &s;tate of affairs at the ca&s;tle and chapel-hou&s;e. The fiend-like pre&s;ident, in her tenfold di&s;gui&s;e, often &s;hot her dire and death-like glances at the victims &s;he had marked as &s;he paced her rounds of the ca&s;tle, the abbey, and the chapel-hou&s;e; &s;he felt a horrid joy as &s;he caught a glance at Henry, her&s;elf un&s;een; the pangs of de&s;ire agonized her heart, even while &s;he meditated the murther of the object. John Fitzorton, True George, Olivia, Caroline, Charles, and father Arthur, alternately a&s;&s;ailed her view as &s;he prowled the wood paths; lighted her fire of withered leaves, or came laden like the re&s;t of her &s;able companions, with the fallen branches, or with the alms, which for the &s;ake of
<PB N="526" REF="536">pre&s;erving her a&s;&s;umed character, &s;he con|de&s;cended to collect. Her glut of venge|ance, indeed, made her forego all claims, and forget all ideas of former &s;elf-love. She &s;et the example of hardihood and a di&s;dain of difficulty to the re&s;t. She ab|&s;tained from every exce&s;s, though their rags, and moving furniture, and habitation concealed, were enriched by the choice&s;t fare. The&s;e &s;he di&s;tributed prudently to the re&s;t, but practi&s;ed a &s;tern &s;elf-denial on her own habits of luxury. Her profu&s;e tre&s;&s;es were darkened by art, and tucked within a dirty coif; and while her grim a&s;&s;ociates &s;tretched along the woods, or &s;lumbered in the caverns, &s;he &s;till held watch, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in gloomy vigilance, intent upon her prey. Miles was no le&s;s diligent. Dabble, was alternately in every quarter. Every evil &s;pirit was either on guard, or on the &s;cout; thrice was that part of their plan, which re&s;pected Henry and John, on the edge of being effected by the &s;ilent operation of poi&s;ons, but was of nece&s;&s;ity &s;u&s;pended. The death of Sir Gui&s;e
<PB N="527" REF="537">alone prevented his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the night of his funeral was at length judged to be mo&s;t apt for the grand bur&s;t of vengeance; but it was broken off by a quarrel among&s;t them&s;elves. The brother Otleys were &s;till at &s;trife about &s;uperiority, but now Gamaliel was endued with a tru&s;t more confidential and more intrepid than that of David. To him was al|lotted the di&s;tinction of taking vengeance on John Fitzorton, and a cho&s;en band was appointed him for that enterprize. David expo&s;tulated, and threatened to go him&s;elf in&s;tantly to the ca&s;tle, and make di&s;covery of the whole plot. He was directly &s;eized by the furious tribe, and till his fare could be determined, the dungeon of the abbey was his pri&s;on-hou&s;e; there they &s;uffered him, either through re&s;entment, or the ab&s;orbing image of revenge on others, to die of famine. One of the females, however, le&s;s callous than the re&s;t, and who had in a former gyp&s;ey expedition attached her&s;elf to a youth of the <HI>legitimate</HI> tribe, as tho&s;e at the ca&s;tle were called, even with the &s;on of the chief, took pity on his &s;ufferings, and relieved him, but found him almo&s;t ga&s;|ping
<PB N="528" REF="538">for breath. "I die," &s;aid he, "but let it not be unrevenged on tho&s;e who have murdered me,&mdash;fly this in&s;tant,&mdash;take with you this bundle of rags, which hold the &s;ecret fates of the noble&s;t men,&mdash;the lovelie&s;t women,&mdash;my ancient ma&s;ters,&mdash;my be&s;t friends,&mdash;all I have wronged,&mdash;all who are marked for an almo&s;t immediate and dread|ful death,&mdash;if you would e&s;cape the hell that now burns within me, and haply &s;hall burn for ever,&mdash;lo&s;e not a moment,&mdash;away! I die!" The wretch with a de&s;pairing hand, &s;eized part of the food which &s;he had brought, and expired devouring it. The terrified Jeputha, &s;o was &s;he called, ru&s;hed from the cavern by the &s;ecret door, which &s;he had explored, and gaining the woods that united with the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age unperceived, and favoured by the night, &s;he followed an impul&s;e &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t, not to make her reports at the ca&s;tle; but accelerated both by horror and affright &s;he travelled onward, nor re&s;ted her &s;tep till &s;he gained the Bury, where, &s;eeking the tribe who were protected by Partington, &s;he gave

<P>To the puni&s;hment and ignominy of the vicious, however, &s;ucceeded an event of the mo&s;t unexpected kind, from the relation of which the virtuous mu&s;t feel a pang.</P>
<P>Olivia Fitzorton had re&s;i&s;ted every per&s;ua|&s;ion of her friend the apothecary, in regard to nouri&s;hing her child at her own brea&s;t, on account of a pectoral complaint, the only one from which, per&s;onally &s;peaking, &s;he had ever felt inconvenience in her whole
<PB N="532" REF="542">life. She argued, that the infant which drew its fir&s;t and pure&s;t nouri&s;hment from the bo&s;om of a &s;tranger, was, in effect, but half its mother's child: &s;he hence deemed it a practice &s;o unnatural, as to be but one re|move from a &s;ucking babe being turned out of doors by its mother, without any nouri&s;h|ment at all: and "if it be true," would &s;he &s;ay, "that any part of the di&s;po&s;ition of the fo&s;ter parent be infu&s;ed with the milk, the fa&s;hion of the times can only be ju&s;tified when the natural nur&s;e, con&s;cious of a bad con&s;titution, or of a wor&s;e heart, trembles at the thought of entailing upon her offspring, her own infirmities of body or of mind; but, even in that ca&s;e, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted, that the utmo&s;t inve&s;tigation &s;hould be made into the health and morals of the woman to whom the child was to be entru&s;ted, otherwi&s;e, &s;he con|ceived, that the real mother was as re&s;pon|&s;ible for the future &s;orrows, &s;ins, and &s;ickly, or tainted habits of her infant, as if they were more immediately derived from her&s;elf. And as to the circum&s;tance of a &s;poiled
<PB N="533" REF="543">&s;hape, or any other cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned by ambi|tious beauty, or negligent fa&s;hion, for the transfer of their offspring to a hireling, &s;he would have blu&s;hed with &s;hame, or wept with grief, could any one have judged her capable of covering the vanity of a wife and a parent under &s;o unfeeling an apology."</P>
<P>It is, however, certain, that in a few pul|monary ca&s;es, a mother cannot po&s;&s;ibly in|dulge in a more fatal tenderne&s;s than to &s;uckle her own child: and an injury which Olivia had in very early youth received, was unfortunately of that kind.</P>
<P>She owned, however, that it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, be wrong, as &s;he did not feel her&s;elf quite &s;o &s;tout as u&s;ual, but the cu&s;tom was &s;o natural in gene|ral, that &s;he could not allow her&s;elf to be an exception. The infant Angelica, was, there|fore, fed from its morther's brea&s;t, and exhi|bited every &s;ign of good health, during the fir&s;t month: the &s;olemnity, and fe&s;tival of the chri&s;tening, at which, on account of Caroline's ab&s;ence, Johanna became &s;pon&s;or, was performed, and ob&s;erved with all the
<PB N="534" REF="544">innocent mirth that affection, decorum, and gratitude could &s;upply. The conduct of her Henry, and of every friend, was all, in ef|fect, that love it&s;elf, could, in its fonde&s;t &s;olicitude, perform. The child continued thriving to its eighth month, when the hooping-cough weakened it to a degree, that the tender mother was induced to keep it at the brea&s;t long after Mr. Burton, and, indeed, the parent's own health had given warning it ought to be weaned: the ravaging di&s;order, on arriving at its cri&s;is, induced convul&s;ions, which put an end to the life of the babe on the day that it had accompli&s;hed its fir&s;t year. The phy&s;ician who had at|tended, Partington's brother, apprehended that a degree of putridity accompanied in|flammation in the la&s;t week of the child's di&s;order, and was earne&s;t with Olivia to &s;u&s;|pend her attendance; with this requi&s;ition being &s;econded by Henry, &s;he complied, as he in&s;i&s;ted on remaining with her in the apartment, and as he &s;hared the love, to &s;hare the danger of a parent. On the fir&s;t favourable &s;ymptom of abating heat, how|ever
<PB N="535" REF="545">reported with caution by the good apothecary, the mother flew to the cradle, where &s;eeing lu&s;tre in the eye, and bloom on the cheek of her child, although the&s;e were but the in&s;idious flu&s;hings, and flame, of the malady&mdash;&s;he care&s;&s;ed her little Angelica with a mother's ardent &s;incerity&mdash;but, alas, &s;he at the &s;ame time drew venom from its lips&mdash; Olivia was her&s;elf &s;eized with a fever the &s;ucceeding evening, which made &s;uch de|vouring progre&s;s as to baffle every human aid, and Olivia and her babe, the former almo&s;t as free from the tinge of the world as the latter, expired within a few hours of each other.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picion that her di&s;order was in|fectious, prevailed neither on Henry nor John Fitzorton to withhold their attendance: the prayers and tears of Olivia could avail no|thing with the former&mdash;nor was the latter ever ab&s;ent, but when it was inevitable.&mdash; Neither could Johanna or Mrs. Herbert, who had long been returned from the Bury, be deterred from admini&s;tering to their friend&mdash;
<PB N="536" REF="546">the children alone were re&s;trained, and the&s;e only becau&s;e Partington had literally run away with them to the Bury, on the fir&s;t mention of danger, but came back him&s;elf to the ca&s;tle, and was one of the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in attempting the pre&s;ervation of its faire&s;t in|habitant. "Ah! deny us not&mdash;deny not your Henry, at lea&s;t!&mdash;O mo&s;t good&mdash;mo&s;t excellent&mdash;his claims in all you hope, in all you fear!" &s;aid he.&mdash;"As I have long lived for you, &s;o I &s;wear to you, be&s;t of wives, and parents&mdash;would I die!"</P>
<P>But the angel of death had its mandate, and Olivia obeyed. Yet &s;he was in the fulle&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and almo&s;t in the enjoyment, of her rea&s;on till within a few minutes of her being removed to regions, where the proude&s;t reach of human thought is as infant feeble|ne&s;s. Her late&s;t powers of mind were em|ployed in a&s;&s;uring her &s;urrounding family&mdash; and &s;he de&s;ired tho&s;e who loved her, which, was, in truth, all who knew her, might be a&s;&s;ured, al&s;o, that, as &s;he had long lived, &s;o was &s;he now dying, the happie&s;t of the happy!
<PB N="537" REF="547">She tenderly embraced all pre&s;ent in their turn. She joined the hands of Johanna and the lieutenant&mdash;of True George, and of her gentle Jane; the latter of whom &s;he em|braced twice, and whi&s;pered, as if it were the whi&s;pering of cherubim, a certainty of &s;ee|ing, knowing, and loving her, where the &s;ociety of the good is eternal. Then as the overwhelmed Henry and John approach|ed&mdash;&s;he exerted that fortitude, which the faith alone that in&s;pires it can be&s;tow.&mdash; "O, unutterably loved and honoured! this would be the moment of hopele&s;s de&s;ola|tion&mdash; the moment in which I &s;hould quit my being in de&s;pair, could I &s;uppo&s;e it was that which was to &s;eparate me for ever from Henry."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed; and John, who had hitherto borne his agony well, by turns advancing and receding, and as often &s;tanding aloof, or &s;heltered from ob&s;ervation by the croud, at length came forward.</P>
<P>"And thou, O pride and patron of all my happy days!" &s;aid Olivia, extending her hand;&mdash;"thou art another cau&s;e, why I
<PB N="538" REF="548">&s;hould have hope in death&mdash;My little ones&mdash; ble&s;s, ble&s;s them, O God!&mdash;will have two parents&mdash;two&mdash;ah! I know not how many good beings will extend towards them a parent's love!&mdash;Can they ever want a mo|ther's care, while the&s;e kind, generous friends, and my dear ab&s;ent Caroline, remain on earth?&mdash;Ah! my Henry! tell her, whom in dawning life I loved, that with my la&s;t re|mains of breath I ble&s;s her&mdash;and tell her too," continued &s;he, exerting her&s;elf to be|come di&s;tinct, "that did I not believe her affections were placed in a bo&s;om too wi&s;e, too noble to &s;uffer the external forms of de|votion, to prove an impediment, now pray|er, and penitence, and death, have removed the more &s;ub&s;tantial ob&s;tacle."</P>
<P>Olivia looked at John, and then proceed|ed&mdash; "My &s;pirit would not fly even to the regions of happine&s;s, in perfect joy but for this, till I had bequeathed her to the father of my children&mdash;my deare&s;t, deare&s;t Henry."</P>
<P>A few minutes only prior to her di&s;&s;olu|tion, her mind &s;eemed to vibrate betwixt rea&s;on and delirium, during which &s;he &s;up|plicated
<PB N="539" REF="549">that her dead infant might be brought to her. "Poor love! it can do me no harm now," &s;aid &s;he. Her life, indeed, was ebbing fa&s;t away, and her phy&s;ician de&s;ired &s;he might be gratified in her reque&s;t. Ac|cordingly her hu&s;band brought the little An|gelica, but &s;tood with it at &s;ome di&s;tance, as if &s;till in fear of its infection. When Olivia perceived a complacent &s;mile on her infant's face, and declared that "her dream was out&mdash;it has certainly a likene&s;s of Hen|ry," &s;aid &s;he, "and it will be my guide to happine&s;s eternal&mdash;yes, my vi&s;ion is come to pa&s;s. See&mdash;&s;ee John&mdash;the very lineaments of your brother&mdash;even as I told you;&mdash;the child &s;hall convey its happy mother to hea|ven&mdash;already the crown of glory is en|circling me, and now in the blazing &s;apphire I read&mdash;'Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful!'&mdash;you know the re&s;t."</P>
<P>She uttered this with a mixture of wild|ne&s;s and coherence, &s;hifting her looks, alter|nately, from the child to its father, and then to heaven. She beckoned Henry to come nearer.</P>
<P><PB N="540" REF="550">"There can be no longer any thing to fear or to hope," &s;aid the phy&s;ician: "in|dulge her." Henry advanced with the corp&s;e of his late&s;t born. The eyes of Olivia &s;eemed to &s;ettle on both, as if from &s;en&s;ations of joy&mdash;then bending towards them, &s;he &s;tretch|ed forth her hands as to receive her child, &s;oftly &s;aying&mdash;"you will follow us;" and, in the &s;ucceeding in&s;tant, &s;he yielded up her innocent life in her hu&s;band's arms.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LV.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER, perhaps, has there been &s;ince the beginning of time, a death more &s;erene, if we except the few wandering moments that preceded it, and even tho&s;e &s;eemed to blend the &s;light &s;igh of parting life, with a foreta&s;te of heavenly tran&s;port; never had there been a life more free from malady or woe: never has there been, nor &s;hall there ever be, a death more generally, or more de&s;ervedly, lamented; although, perhaps, after a life &s;o free from evil, and replete with
<PB N="541" REF="551">good, it is a &s;pecies of &s;elf-love, even if it be not of &s;infulne&s;s, to grieve that &s;uch a &s;pirit is gone to enjoy the fulne&s;s of its re|compen&s;e.</P>
<P>Humanity, however, long and poignantly bewailed its lo&s;s; for not only kindred vir|tue, but every other that deigns to vi&s;it mortals, were votaries at the &s;hrine of Olivia fitzorton. And, among&s;t tho&s;e votaries, none were more &s;incere than Henry, who not only in the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, but for many months after, &s;eemed &s;o ab&s;tracted from him|&s;elf, as to have not even a thought that di|vided him from the memory of her, to who&s;e happine&s;s, for the greater part of his life, he had been a generous martyr.</P>
<P>But friend&s;hip, gratitude, pity, and all that incites to acts of ju&s;tice founded on the&s;e, demand, that the &s;acred &s;orrows of John Fitzorton &s;hould not be overlooked.</P>
<P>While the &s;ole being, who had ever truly touched his heart, was taking an eternal leave of him, and the world, not a tear was &s;een upon his cheek, not a &s;igh was heard from his bo&s;om, and he was the fir&s;t to quit the
<PB N="542" REF="552">chamber of death, when that being was no more. Henry, on the contrary, remained be&s;ide the body, with one arm &s;till cla&s;ping his dead child, in de&s;pite of all argument&mdash; long after Dr. Partington, and the apothe|cary, had, in a manner, forced every other per&s;on, even the faithful True George, out of the room; but when the phy&s;ician de|manded a conference with the colonel on that &s;ubject, John went back into the cham|ber, and by gentle, yet cogent, accents of per&s;ua&s;ion&mdash;and a&s;king if he had deter|mined to leave his &s;urviving children with|out any parent, when they mo&s;t wanted a father's care? Henry &s;prung from the bed on which he had thrown him&s;elf betwixt his decea&s;ed wife and babe, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be conducted into his own apartment.</P>
<P>He had expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign to remain there for the re&s;t of the night; but True George, who re&s;olved to &s;it up with him, had by an inadvertent expre&s;&s;ion changed his purpo&s;e. "When do they talk," que&s;tioned Henry, "of taking the remains of my wife and child from me?" "Alas! to-morrow,
<PB N="543" REF="553">your honour," an&s;wered the afflicted George, "becau&s;e, as it is thought they died of &s;omething that was catching, Dr. Partington, and Mr. Burton, &s;ay it will not be right for them to &s;tay long in the ca&s;tle&mdash;but, for my part, if it was not for your honour, and another per&s;on or two, I &s;hould wi&s;h to catch the malady that I might die too! for I don't find any thing a per&s;on gets by living here in this world but &s;eeing people one loves go, one after another, out of it."</P>
<P>Henry, who had not taken off his cloaths, &s;carcely &s;taid long enough to hear the whole of George's reflections, but attending chiefly to the information which preceded them&mdash; he declared his wi&s;h to take his la&s;t leave of the remains of Olivia, and her little one&mdash; "and there can be no opportunity &s;o favour|able as the moment before us," &s;aid he: Henry went into Olivia's chamber attended by George, whom, however, he beckoned to &s;top at the door, which being partly opened, Henry moved forward with cau|tious and trembling &s;teps, as if fearful of di&s;turbing tho&s;e who were in the &s;leep of
<PB N="544" REF="554">death. As he was approaching the bed, he beheld John bending over it on the &s;ide he had him&s;elf entered. Checked by &s;urpri&s;e and awe, he &s;u&s;pended his &s;tep, and di&s;tinctly heard the words which his brother was uttering.</P>
<P>They breathed over the dead body of Olivia the fir&s;t declaration of love. They recapitulated the conduct which that love had urged, to pre&s;erve the peace of its object unbroken to the la&s;t moment of her life. "And if, O! &s;acred &s;pirit," &s;aid the lover, addre&s;&s;ing the corp&s;e, of which he had taken up one of the lifele&s;s hands, and laid it on his bo&s;om&mdash;"if in the unen|couraged but re&s;i&s;tle&s;s feelings, a &s;entiment more tender than brother ever felt&mdash;perhaps ever can feel,&mdash;has &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ailed my heart, and aught of blame &s;hould &s;till attach, to eternally combated, and involuntary emo|tion, let thy now angel prayers intercede with the be&s;tower of that heart to ab&s;olve my frailty! yet how can errour mix with a principle which at this moment that I am beholding thee a breathle&s;s corp&s;e ha&s;tening
<PB N="545" REF="555">to decay, making that corp&s;e more wel|come to my eye, more precious to my &s;oul, than all thou ha&s;t left behind thee to bloom in health, and youth, and beauty? Ah, no! like the &s;oul it&s;elf my affection &s;hall be eter|nal, attend me as in thy life time here, and follow thee to other worlds."</P>
<P>John. had turned his head, &s;omewhat &s;tartled; for Henry, impelled by his feel|ings, came onward. The Colonel had &s;till retained one of Olivia's hands. "Henry," &s;aid he, "you have di&s;covered my pa&s;&s;ion: you now perceive that a wretch, more di&s;|a&s;trous than your&s;elf, had really being.&mdash; Behold the victim! behold too the object of his affection. But &s;he is no more thy wife, my brother: death hath di&s;&s;olved the bond that made her fond and faithful hand appropriate to Henry. Alas! it is mouldring into nought. The a&s;cended &s;pirit, therefore, which has left it, is now our object&mdash;that too is free of human ties except by heavenly &s;ympathy; and tho&s;e who &s;till love her mu&s;t &s;hare with myriads, with all the ho&s;t of heaven."</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="556">The brothers tenderly embraced. John pre&s;&s;ed Olivia's hand yet more fondly, and gently replacing it by her &s;ide, withdrew from the bed to the window, turning his eyes on the body as he walked from it. He lingered a moment, pa&s;&s;ed the chamber, and di&s;appeared, then re-entered&mdash;receded again, and again advanced. Henry kneeled down by the &s;ide of the bed, and care&s;&s;ed by turns Olivia and Angelica, then put one of the infant's arms within the cla&s;p of its mother's in the po&s;ition he had found it. "Forgive me! angel &s;oul of her," &s;aid he, "who once gave almo&s;t matchle&s;s beauty to this lifele&s;s form.&mdash;O! forgive me, if I was le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e wondrous graces than they de&s;erved! thou now art, haply, con&s;cious of the motive, and will pardon what con|&s;tancy to former vows, and unconquerable love of their object alone could cau&s;e. Had tho&s;e vows been thine the boa&s;ted beauties of the earth&mdash;the earth it&s;elf would have wanted power to draw me deliberately from thee."</P>
<P><PB N="547" REF="557">John, who had a &s;econd time returned, heard in turn this declaration, and when it was clo&s;ed ran ha&s;tily to his brother, pre&s;&s;ed him with the utmo&s;t affection to his bo&s;om, and wept. They left the &s;acred chamber together, turning at every &s;tep, but when John had ordered the attendants, who were waiting without, to return into Olivia's apartment to watch the bodies, and had con|ducted Henry into his own chamber, at the door of which the unwearied George was waiting his ma&s;ter's return&mdash;"Brother," &s;aid he, "I feel an a&s;&s;urance, not of this world, that our prayers are heard, our penitence ac|cepted! for the re&s;t our weakne&s;s mu&s;t have way&mdash;and our pillow may be &s;teeped in the tears of our frailty, becau&s;e we are &s;till of the earth&mdash;but happy as was our Olivia, how faint, how feeble, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed moments of that felicity to the bli&s;s &s;he now enjoys! Let us part in peace. If John Fitz|orton can reconcile him&s;elf to her lo&s;s it ought to be &s;upportable to Henry."</P>
<P>On the evening, however, of the &s;ucceed|ing day Henry &s;hewed &s;igns of the di&s;order
<PB N="548" REF="558">we have alluded to, and Dr. Partington's brother, the phy&s;ician, as well as the good apothecary, determined it to be the re&s;ult of incautious attendance in Olivia's apartment. John, and the re&s;t of the family, and its friends, e&s;caped, but the more irritable Henry caught the malady, and was its prey for &s;everal months&mdash;during which not one of his friends of the Abbey, Bury, or Ca&s;tle, could be per&s;uaded by any warnings of dan|ger to leave him. He remained almo&s;t a year with alternations of weakne&s;s and &s;trength, and when his body might be called convale&s;cent his mind appeared &s;till to &s;uffer from an incurable wound. Charles Stuart, the almo&s;t con&s;tant attendant of his pillow, ob&s;erved this, and imparted it to the colonel, who, watching by his bed-&s;ide a favourable interval, kindly took his hand, and thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him:&mdash;</P>
<P>"I have attended with plea&s;ure, my dear Henry, to the progre&s;s of your returning health; but that plea&s;ure has been, and is &s;till, checked by what I have ob&s;erved&mdash;a &s;olicitude&mdash;a mi&s;ery, not the effect of the
<PB N="549" REF="559">weakne&s;s which mere illne&s;s leaves behind, &s;till bends you to the earth. My brother, we are left to the &s;upport and con&s;olation of each other; con&s;ide to me the cau&s;e, and let me &s;ee if it cannot be removed&mdash;perhaps the incapacitating powers of a &s;evere and tedi|ous malady have too long robbed you of the &s;olace of your accu&s;tomed employments&mdash; infirmity doth &s;till neglect all office: from the &s;ick pillow, even the mu&s;e will take her flight&mdash;the friend and in&s;pirer of our gayer hours, and of our youthful enthu&s;ia&s;ms, our play of fancy, and our flow of &s;pirit&mdash;yes, &s;he, like other faithle&s;s mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, often leaves her votaries when they can no longer admini&s;ter to her vanity, or &s;oothe her with melodious adulations. I &s;ay not this in mockery of her art; for I have long cea&s;ed to attack even the vulnerable parts of her magic, &s;ince the day that I &s;aw my brother wounded in &s;pirit, beyond the reach of &s;por|tive ridicule or &s;erious remon&s;trance&mdash;&s;ince I &s;aw that he was not &s;imply the victim of that dire &s;y&s;tem of &s;entimental in&s;anity, which men of feveri&s;h imaginations have oppo&s;ed

He has a heart to feel that one real charity &s;hewn to the lowe&s;t of the &s;ons of men, in the mo&s;t de&s;olate corner of the earth, though it were but to carry into a hut the comfort of a &s;ingle mor&s;el, when that mor&s;el was wanted, and de&s;erved, returns to the re&s;torer a tran&s;port more &s;incere, and pre&s;ents to him an image more re&s;plendent, than all the pic|rures of bounty which the elect of Apollo ever painted, or, &s;hall I &s;ay, that realizes the painting and poe&s;y of the mo&s;t happy and benevolent mu&s;e, who&s;e be&s;t fount of &s;u&s;pi|ration is a generous heart; the cottages, and
<PB N="551" REF="561">the cottagers of our now angel friend&mdash;we &s;hould learn to &s;peak of her, as we do of heaven it&s;elf&mdash;with cha&s;tened plea&s;ure&mdash;yet devoid of grief," continued John, &s;ighing&mdash; "I &s;ay, my brother, the&s;e cottagers&mdash;and, perhaps, more than the&s;e&mdash;are devolved on you&mdash;it would gladden your heart to hear their daily, hourly, enquiries&mdash;to &s;ee the confirmations of their grateful love&mdash;and a continuance of all their joys &s;hall again be yours."</P>
<P>"My dear, deare&s;t brother!" exclaimed Henry, embracing him.&mdash;"But even the exerci&s;e of bounty," continued John, "rich as it is in happine&s;s, cannot wholly occupy an active mind. Short as life is, it will be found too long for every man who wants employment proportioned to his powers. How &s;hall I again bring forward what has &s;o often been un&s;ucce&s;sfully propo&s;ed to you? how &s;hall I remind you that&mdash;while you have generou&s;ly obeyed our ble&s;&s;ed fa|ther in, perhaps, a hard command, you &s;till are di&s;obedient in regard to another not &s;o rigorous?" "I obeyed him according to
<PB N="552" REF="562">my promi&s;e," an&s;wered Henry, "in all that was po&s;&s;ible; I re&s;i&s;ted only that which, even, at the time of the command, was be|yond the reach of my obedience&mdash;el&s;e, &s;o aweful was the moment, at which I received his la&s;t commands, and &s;o little power had I to advert to my&s;elf when I beheld him leav|ing me for ever, that had a thou&s;and more &s;acrifices been exacted, I &s;hould have pro|mi&s;ed to become the victim of them all." "I do not comprehend you," &s;aid John.&mdash; "It could not be beyond your power to enter into that profe&s;&s;ion for which you had been de&s;igned; and although we all ob&s;erved a negligence in your preparations, I have, for my own part, always imputed it to your former perplexed &s;ituation, and a too vigor|ous pur&s;uit of other &s;tudies. There was, in|deed, a time when I could not but think your devotion to the mu&s;e interrupted devo|tion of a higher kind." "Never! God forbid!" an&s;wered Henry. "I tru&s;t," re|&s;umed John, "you did not withdraw from the &s;acred path in which your father walked with &s;o much honour, to compliment the
<PB N="553" REF="563">faith of any other per&s;on, however dear the object."</P>
<P>Henry &s;prung up in his bed, withdrawing his hand with &s;ome force from the cla&s;p of his brother. "Compliment away my faith! fie, fie!&mdash;no, &s;ir!&mdash;no, John!" &s;aid he,&mdash; "nor would the object to whom you alluded have accepted&mdash;&s;he would have &s;purned the compliment&mdash;&s;corned the man who could in&s;ult her with the offer." John was ex|tremely moved. "Forgive, dear Henry, forgive me," &s;aid he; "my har&s;h qualities you perceive are not yet all &s;ubdued. Let us proceed like brothers, you know the rea|&s;ons which have clo&s;ed my lips on &s;ubjects that I knew were of deep concern to you: but I did not clo&s;e my eyes. I have not pa&s;&s;ed over Caroline Stuart, among&s;t un|heeded things. I have ob&s;erved her in the hours of varied trial, of hard temptation&mdash;I have noticed her often willing to yield her life, but never to &s;werve from any of its du|ties&mdash; I have beheld that life &s;inking gradu|ally away, again&s;t all her exerted powers to pre&s;erve it, becau&s;e its pre&s;ervantion was the
<PB N="554" REF="564">command of God; even while, for her&s;elf, exi&s;tence wanted every comfort of health, and every relief of hope&mdash;when, indeed, &s;he repelled hope, becau&s;e it was errour to harbour, and crime to encourage it." The colonel perceiving his brother much agitated, be&s;eeched him to hear what he had farther to offer with patience. "In a thou&s;and points, my Henry," continued he, "this has been the victim which has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed us all in &s;uf|fering, and in &s;uffering well; and I have, for &s;ome time, cea&s;ed to wonder at your attach|ment, taking into con&s;ideration the early impre&s;&s;ion by which it was formed: but it was again&s;t all order, all rectitude, all &s;acred laws that I &s;hould tell you &s;o before."</P>
<P>Here, embracing Henry, he proceeded to inform him how he had contemplated this &s;ubject&mdash;"Thus have I argued," &s;aid John, "I have not been unfaithful even to my &s;e|cond impre&s;&s;ions, why &s;hould my brother be incon&s;tant to his fir&s;t? and what has a difference of religious belief to do with reli|gion it&s;elf? when I thought oppo&s;itely to this, did I not think narrowly? did I not
<PB N="555" REF="565">think wrong? have I not &s;ince found the e&s;&s;ence of devotion the &s;ame in the catholic father Arthur, and the prote&s;tant Sir Ar|mine? and was not the latter heavily mi&s;|taken in this objection? &s;urely, had this been the only one it might have yielded to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of rea&s;on and truth. But there were, alas, &s;o many others&mdash;and &s;ome &s;o horrible"&mdash;</P>
<P>"O, my ever generous and good pro|tector," interrupted Henry, "it has been my fate through life to be entangled in the mazes of involuntary &s;ecrets, inevitable my&s;|teries, another is yet behind, and that had been &s;hut up for ever in the few hearts to which it has been confided, had the cau&s;e continued which made it at fir&s;t, and for &s;o many years continued it a private concern to that heart alone. We have all of us had, perhaps, in &s;ome points, too little dome&s;tic confidence. The &s;ecrets of our family have been al&s;o, &s;ecrets to our&s;elves, and exacted from us by events. Re&s;erves beget re&s;erve: though in our perplexed &s;tate of general counteraction, the mo&s;t unbounded confi|dence
<PB N="556" REF="566">would have little availed. No, I did not compliment away my religion, but the faith of her I loved&mdash;became MINE."</P>
<P>"Brother!" ejaculated John. "Mine," re&s;umed Henry, "on contemplation&mdash;on choice,&mdash;I adopted it in the very conviction of my heart&mdash;I ob&s;erved it operate on the age of father Arthur&mdash;on the youth of Caroline&mdash; and, although, I &s;aw the &s;ame &s;pirit, differ|ing in a few ceremonials, influence the no le&s;s pious life of my venerable father, and &s;hed grace divine on the conduct of Olivia&mdash; I was affected even by the forms which the prote&s;tant church rejects, and on the day that Caroline Stuart heard my vows of love, I made with my own heart tho&s;e vows which even to this day &s;he has not heard, that our religion &s;hould be one. Hence my long po&s;tponement&mdash;again&s;t all remon&s;trance&mdash;du|ring the life-time of my father, of carrying into effect one part of his plan for me, although I did not deem it right&mdash;when I found communication would only have em|bittered the remains of his life&mdash;to betray my &s;ecret."</P>
<P><PB N="557" REF="567">"Then you are catholic," &s;aid John, "and by whom may you have been pro&s;e|lited?" "By no one," an&s;wered Henry. "To one alone I imparted my feelings." "Father Arthur, I pre&s;ume," exclaimed John, &s;cornfully. "I am eager for his re|ply." "It was brief," cried Henry. "He told me it would violate the &s;anctity of his own belief in things mo&s;t holy, were he to di&s;&s;uade; and it would trench on his conduct as a neighbour, and a friend of Sir Armine Fitzorton, a di&s;tingui&s;hed member of the church of England, to countenance what I had confided: 'Your confidence in me is &s;afe,' &s;aid he, 'but I can give no council." "I had my fears," cried John. "I am glad I wronged him. O, if you thought him acce&s;&s;ary to my re&s;olves, you did, in|deed, wrong him." an&s;wered Henry&mdash;"I urged him to tell me if he thought I was proceeding in the right path?" 'I tru&s;t in God we are all doing &s;o,' he an&s;wered. "I importuned him to admit me to his chapel at his hours of prayer. 'You pre&s;s me hardly, youth,' &s;aid he. 'I will not invite: I dare
<PB N="558" REF="568">not exclude. The temple in which your pious father adores the Almighty, would not be &s;hut again&s;t a catholic &s;upplicant, who might wi&s;h to enter. Can I clo&s;e the door of mine upon a prote&s;tant votary?"</P>
<P>"Noble Arthur, Then you are not in verity a papi&s;t?" que&s;tioned John.</P>
<P>"In verity?" an&s;wered Henry, "what call you truth? Is it not from within? What mean you by vows? Do the words and external &s;igns by which they are ex|pre&s;&s;ed, make them bonds, or give them &s;anctity?"</P>
<P>Henry took from under his pillow a cruci|fix, and then re&s;umed his que&s;tions.</P>
<P>"Derive tho&s;e vows any hallowed potency from this frail image of him, to who&s;e real e&s;&s;ence they were offered? Are they not all con&s;ecrated by the heart? As I was not ab&s;olutely bani&s;hed from the chapel I at|tended, though, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, by &s;tealth, both its matin and ve&s;per duties. The monk one day demanded, If I had yet con&s;ulted with Sir Armine? I owned that I knew his &s;teadine&s;s of faith too well to
<PB N="559" REF="569">dare communicate. "I dare," an&s;wered the monk. But on my promi&s;ing, that before I again joined his congregation in that way, my father's con&s;ent &s;hould be attain|ed, or I would bring proof it &s;hould be no longer expedient to &s;olicit it: he was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. I withdrew, however, from all public forms, and communed only with my&s;elf. My nuptials, no longer to be po&s;t|poned, and impo&s;&s;ible to be prevented, took place. I yielded up every thing in that hour&mdash;that moment&mdash;but what I could not change&mdash;my love and my religion. Tho&s;e were in the &s;anctuary of my own heart. Excu&s;e, brother, this prolixity: the occa|&s;ion claims it&mdash;and it unfolds to you a thou|&s;and my&s;teries in my conduct. Re&s;pect my &s;incerity, &s;hould you blame my election: I am no example to others, but I am true to my own belief.</P>
<P>"God knows," replied John, "which of us is mo&s;t in the right: but it is clear to me, that, although I give you full credit for your feelings&mdash;and pity from my &s;oul
<PB N="560" REF="570">all you mu&s;t have &s;uffered to conceal them, it appears very clear, that had Caroline Stuart been a prote&s;tant, you would never have been a catholic. We will not, how|ever, di&s;cu&s;s the point farther; for I am brought round to what I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to mention, by a very circuitous way. It has plea&s;ed the Omnipotent, my brother, to remove many apparently in&s;uperable im|pediments; and the mo&s;t inau&s;picious pa&s;&s;ion that, perhaps, the human heart ever &s;et out with; as its only hope in the morning of life, has ri&s;en above &s;everal of the darke&s;t clouds in the noon of your days. There is every rea&s;on to believe a renewal of your affections, now they may be innocently of|fered, would not be unacceptable to her, for whom, doubtle&s;s, your love can ea&s;ily be revived."&mdash;"Revived," exclaimed Henry,</P>
<P>"I will have one of my &s;olitary think|ings on this matter," re&s;umed John, &s;mil|ing, but his face pallid, and care upon his brow. "Meantime be a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall not allow you to &s;uffer any pain, or forego
<PB N="561" REF="571">any plea&s;ure, when it is con&s;i&s;tent, and within my power to prevent the one and pro|mote the other."</P>
<P>By &s;uch means was Henry relieved from the la&s;t, and one of the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome my&s;teries that had ever hung upon his heart; and thus too, were again opened pro&s;pects, on which he had not even dared to ca&s;t his eyes, or voluntarily fix his thoughts, for many years.</P>
<P>It was among&s;t his brother John's max|ims, never to hint a promi&s;e without good likelihood of its being in his power to per|form it, and as the re&s;ult of his meditation on the above &s;ubject, was a belief that Henry Fitzorton and Caroline Stuart, after all their &s;acrifices and &s;ufferings, de&s;erved to come together; and as their union no longer &s;eemed to oppo&s;e any other duty, could not, he hoped, be offen&s;ive even to the &s;pirits of his father, or of Olivia, which if con|&s;cious of the projecting de&s;ign, were con|&s;cious, al&s;o, of the long reverence &s;hewn to, and, at length, the honourable removal of, every former barrier. As the la&s;t balm,
<PB N="562" REF="572">therefore, which could be poured over his own wounds, John &s;et on foot a treaty, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lieutenant, that might at length heal tho&s;e of his brother and friend.</P>

<P>IN pur&s;uance of this plan, he wrote to father Arthur a letter, of which Charles Stuart him&s;elf promi&s;ed to be the bearer:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR AND REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The important&mdash;I will not, &s;ince they were the de&s;ignations of heaven, call them unfortunate events, which have hap|pened in our family &s;ince your departure, have, probably, been de&s;cribed to you by our Johanna, or &s;ome other of our friends: they will be more particularly letter; which is to tell you that I no longer &s;ee any rea&s;on to prevent Henry Fitzorton and Caroline Stuart from be|coming man and wife; nor have I now any objection to their being united, ac|cording
<PB N="563" REF="573">to the forms and ceremonies of the catholic church. This declaration will &s;erve to &s;hew that I am in the confi|dence both of the love and religion of my brother, and cha&s;tened as both have been, by almo&s;t every &s;pecies of trial, from the &s;acred hand of God him&s;elf, I &s;hall no more pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e my|&s;elf to either: and in doing this, not|with&s;tanding all pa&s;t horrors, I humbly tru&s;t that I &s;hall offend neither the living nor the dead. Implacability is incon&s;i&s;tent with divine natures; and if penitence can receive pardon from God, it &s;hould &s;urely be &s;ufficient to the forgivene&s;s of men made angels: and that the recompen&s;e we are preparing for long-&s;uffering worth, will be plea&s;ing to the &s;pirits of peace. The reward which is now preparing for the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts have been proved, mu&s;t owe much to your manner of repre&s;enting to mi&s;s Stuart, the &s;everal my&s;terious truths&mdash;my&s;terious, alas! to mortals&mdash;but of ea&s;y proce&s;s to that heavenly director, who conducts the
<PB N="564" REF="574">apparently irreconcilable intere&s;ts of un|numbered worlds. To your wi&s;dom and loving-kindne&s;s, I &s;ubmit the furtherance of the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed. Our worthy Charles will readily be your auxiliary; and he is, moreover, charged with &s;ome propo&s;ed arrangements, as well regarding his own plans of e&s;tabli&s;hment, as that of his friends.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The generous writer of this epi&s;tle looked upon the object it was intended to accom|pli&s;h, as &s;o nearly a good obtained, that he could not withhold its contents from Henry, becau&s;e they would, in effect, con|vey his own &s;entiments, while they &s;anc|tioned tho&s;e of his brother. The lieute|nant was, therefore, di&s;patched to Henry's room; and after the two friends had con|ferred, no time was lo&s;t in preparations, or in performance of the journey. True George, now &s;eeing his ma&s;ter make rapid advances towards health, &s;upplicated to be
<PB N="565" REF="575">the lieutenant's attendant, and the next morning they &s;et out.</P>
<P>But while the hou&s;e of Fitzorton had been, alternately, the re&s;idence of hope and fear, and every extreme of &s;orrow and of joy; in the refuge of Arthur&mdash;in an ob&s;cure nook of the world&mdash;the mo&s;t &s;erious and important events had taken place. Alas! where is that corner of the globe exempt from changes of which the globe it&s;elf is the victim?</P>
<P>On the arrival of the lieutenant and True George at the i&s;land rece&s;s, to which they pa&s;&s;ed immediately from Dartmouth, nei|ther Arthur nor Caroline were to be found. The landlord had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e; and from him, our a&s;toni&s;hed tra|vellers under&s;tood that "his reverence, and the family, had left the i&s;land finally, about &s;ix weeks ago. That the lady Caro|line had departed a month before, but that the monk came to fetch his young black, and his old &s;teward, and the little old dog, they all made &s;o much of; and to give up the hou&s;e, paying, however, the rent to the
<PB N="566" REF="576">uttermo&s;t farthing." "And whither are they gone?" que&s;tioned the lieutenant.&mdash; "Why, your honour," an&s;wered the land|lord, taking a &s;lip of paper from his poc|ket-book, this is the place, where I was, as occa&s;ion &s;erved, to &s;end letters; but though all them, pointing to a pacquet in the parlour window, have arrived, no op|portunity of forwarding them has happened &s;ince his reverence went la&s;t away." The lieutenant now &s;aw letters in the characters of Mrs. Herbert and Johanna, and read with increa&s;ed amazement, the following addre&s;s, in the monk's own hand-writing: 'Pere Arthur, mai&s;on de po&s;te a Coutance, Bas Normandie.' While Charles was reflect|ing what could po&s;&s;ibly be the motive that directed them to that part of the world, and without having confided in any of their mutual friends, or in him&s;elf as a brother, a letter, which had ju&s;t come in by the Engli&s;h packet, was delivered to him containing the&s;e words:</P>

<PB N="567" REF="577">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The enclo&s;ed reached the ca&s;tle within an hour after you had left it. It is mani|fe&s;tly the hand writing of father Arthur, but the foreign po&s;t marks, and the route by which it appears to have come has puzzled us.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>The word <HI>di&s;patch</HI> was written in the po&s;t&s;cript by Henry.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The enclo&s;ure alluded to conveyed intel|ligence which required di&s;patch indeed. It informed the lieutenant of a circum&s;tance the very date of which &s;hook his whole frame on the fir&s;t glance, and when he had ha&s;tily put it under a cover for the ca&s;tle, to go by the returning mail, he en|quired on the quay after the po&s;&s;ible means of getting to the coa&s;t of France? A ve&s;&s;el which had come in a few days before from St. Malo's, was to return by way of Coutance when the wind would permit, but it was not till after waiting ten
<PB N="568" REF="578">days&mdash;ten fatal days&mdash;in the mo&s;t anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e that the ve&s;&s;el could get out of the harbour; a favourable breeze, however, at length, &s;prung up, and they got to &s;ea, and the gale increa&s;ing, they gained the long de&s;ired port.</P>
<P>The moment after Charles and his attend|ant had reached the land, they de&s;ired one of the porters whom they &s;aw on the beach, to conduct them to the Po&s;t-office in the direction, which corre&s;ponded with what was given in the letter, and after a few minutes' walking they came to the Priory-hou&s;e, where they found the &s;till blamele&s;s Prie&s;t with his Indian, and old Denni&s;on &s;itting be&s;ide him. "My &s;on," &s;aid father Arthur, "I expected you would follow our letter, and I am glad at heart to find by your appearing among&s;t us, it has been received." "I will not," ob&s;erved the agitated Charles, "I come not, to que&s;|tion your judgment or your wi&s;dom,&mdash;I come only to a&s;k, why you have withheld from me a circum&s;tance, or any previous knowledge, on which the happine&s;s of a
<PB N="569" REF="579">&s;i&s;ter, and perhaps the life of my bo&s;om-friend entirely depend? But there is no time for words: let me implore you by whatever is mo&s;t holy, to &s;top your ra&s;h proceedings!"&mdash;"What you call ra&s;hne&s;s," exclaimed Arthur, "is in it&s;elf mo&s;t holy, and temerity would con&s;i&s;t in the conduct you recommend. I thought your &s;i&s;ter had &s;tated her duty, yours, and my own, in the letter which you acknowledge to have re|ceived, &mdash;&s;he there told you under what authority I acted,&mdash;I am &s;orry to find you di&s;pute it."&mdash;"Talk not to me of authori|ties, &s;ir!" demanded the lieutenant, yielding to the impetuo&s;ity of his character, and forgetting for a moment to whom he &s;poke&mdash; "Where is my &s;i&s;ter?"&mdash;"She is under protection," replied Arthur.&mdash;"I thought, &s;ir, I was her only natural protector!" re|&s;umed Charles, "under whom could &s;he be more &s;ecure?"&mdash;"Under his whom &s;he has &s;ought," returned the Monk, "under that of her God. Slightly mu&s;t you have peru&s;ed what either &s;he or I have written, or el&s;e
<PB N="570" REF="580">you would blu&s;h, would tremble to a&s;k that que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"How could I hear of my &s;i&s;ter's having clande&s;tinely, and by your connivance, &s;hut her&s;elf up within the walls of a cloy&s;ter?&mdash; from thence was her cruel letter dated. I had not patience to read the dire particu|lars; &mdash;at &s;uch a moment too,&mdash;mi&s;guided girl! when, but for this abhorred &s;eclu&s;ion, we might all have been happy."&mdash;"I under|&s;tand you not," &s;aid Arthur, "what moment, and what happine&s;s? I a&s;&s;ert, young man, that had you paid due re&s;pect to my greet|ing, it would have made known to you the aweful calls upon me, to accompany your &s;i&s;ter from the place of her former refuge to one yet more &s;acred, you would there have been taught to pay more re&s;pect to her motives of devoting her&s;elf, and to mine in conducting her to the cloy&s;ter; but there &s;he mu&s;t remain. I know my duty, and will maintain it."</P>
<P>The door of the hou&s;e had been left un|clo&s;ed on entrance of the lieutenant, while the father, with an expo&s;tulating, deter|mined,
<PB N="571" REF="581">and &s;omewhat of a rebuking voice, was pronouncing the la&s;t &s;entence, another voice, which was in an in&s;tant known to be that of Henry Fitzorton, ejaculated&mdash; "Cloy&s;ter!"&mdash;"O, holy man!" interpo&s;ed a third voice, which proceeded from the colonel, "tho&s;e motives are re&s;pected,&mdash; re&s;pected even by this, my poor di&s;ea&s;ed, di&s;tracted brother, even though he is, alas! their &s;acrifice."&mdash;"Cloy&s;ter! Is &s;he then already entombed?" reiterated Henry, who now fell into the arms of True George, while Denni&s;on and Flore&s;co, Charles, the colonel and the apothecary, and father Arthur, ha&s;ted to his relief. "Alas!" &s;aid the colonel, "from your anxiety, Charles, to convey the tidings of Caroline's de&s;tiny, to your friends at Fitzorton, you directed your pacquet to Henry in&s;tead of John, and all was abruptly di&s;covered; my poor brother was then &s;truggling with the rem|nant of his di&s;order, but per&s;i&s;ted on taking an immediate journey and voyage to this place, and in relief of his de&s;pair, we have all followed. Alas! his pre&s;ent &s;ituation too
<PB N="572" REF="582">plainly proves our efforts have been vain." &mdash;"My dear ma&s;ter revives," cried True George, interrupting John's relation.&mdash; "She is lo&s;t then!" &s;aid Henry, "even in the moment when miracles appeared to have been wrought to &s;ave us both!" His paroxy&s;m now returned, and at the in&s;tance of Mr. Burton he was conducted by the attendants to Denni&s;on's own bed, while the afflicted colonel proceeded to in|form Arthur, that no entreaties could di&s;|&s;uade his brother Henry from coming over, that he was even frantic at oppo&s;ition, prote&s;t|ing that if he arrived too late, his death near the wall where Caroline had &s;hut her&s;elf eter|nally from him, would be his whole wi&s;h, and if he was pro&s;perous in his journey, that pro&s;perity would be his cure. "There was no rea&s;oning with an in&s;ane, who &s;et his life at naught," &s;aid the colonel, "I &s;aw him de&s;perate, and to avoid &s;omething more immediately fatal, I was engaged by our good apothecary's coun&s;el in an act of de&s;pera|tion. We hurried to the proper port, where finding no ve&s;&s;el de&s;tined for France,
<PB N="573" REF="583">we hired a fi&s;hing-boat, and like de&s;pairing adventurers, we tru&s;ted our&s;elves to a troub|led &s;ea under no one au&s;pices of happy for|tune, but that the wind, though turbulent, was fair:&mdash;and we are come &s;afe,&mdash;alas! to what end?&mdash;Caroline is in her cell!"&mdash;"It is indeed true," an&s;wered the wondering Arthur, "Caroline has devoted her&s;elf; and when &s;he entered her convent I did not think, &s;ir, that any po&s;&s;ible event of this world would make me heave a &s;igh at what &s;he has felt it right to do; and, although I grieve, even from my utmo&s;t &s;oul, that my ever-re&s;pected Henry &s;hould be thus wrought upon,&mdash;the whole ma&s;s of things I &s;ee and hear, with re&s;pect to his happine&s;s with Caroline Stuart,&mdash;your coun|tenance of that connexion,&mdash;the intempe|rate, &mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the indecent rage of the lieutenant, are &s;o &s;trange, new, incon&s;i&s;tent, and apparently impo&s;&s;ible, that a more extraordinary my&s;tery than has ever yet involved us, is now before my eyes."</P>
<P><PB N="574" REF="584">"Our letters mu&s;t &s;urely have informed you," &s;aid John.</P>
<P>"I have received &s;ome from the ca&s;tle," interpo&s;ed the monk, "and &s;o has the de|voted Caroline; but when her re&s;olution was once formed, I deemed it prudent, not to intrude upon her any thing of a nature too intere&s;ting in regard to the world, of which &s;he de&s;ired to take an eternal leave, &s;o that for many of the pa&s;t months, we are both utterly ignorant of every occurrence which may have taken place either at the abbey or the ca&s;tle."&mdash; "Gracious heaven!" exclaimed John,&mdash; "then you know not, perhaps, that Olivia&mdash;"</P>
<P>The lieutenant came into the room &s;aying, his friend was more compo&s;ed, and wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to confer with father Arthur in his chamber; "but I cannot," &s;aid Charles, "&s;uffer him to depart until I have thus in the humble&s;t manner &s;upplicated forgivene&s;s for my late ungoverned rage." "That rage has cha&s;ti&s;ed it&s;elf," &s;aid the holy man, &s;tretch|ing forth his hands to receive the folded ones
<PB N="575" REF="585">of Charles; "&s;hall not a loving father forgive his child an offence which &s;orrow and affection cau&s;ed?" They embraced, and the lieutenant delivered the letters he had brought from the rece&s;s. "Oh! had I received the&s;e, and read &s;ome former ones &s;ooner," ob&s;erved Arthur, &s;ighing, "&s;ome|thing might have been avoided. Still all is my&s;tery. Return to your &s;uffering friend, my child, and tell him I will peru&s;e my letters, and attend him. It were wicked to deceive, and therefore touch not the theme that may lead him to delu&s;ion. I crave your promi&s;e, colonel, &s;omewhat longer, to guide me through a labyrinth to who&s;e mazes I have yet no clue." "I will but accompany the lieutenant into my brother's room, and return," &s;aid the colonel. But the papers delivered, &s;oon dilated the train of incidents. The my&s;teries were explained, but the regrets were multiplied. John Fitzorton came back. "Alas!" &s;aid Ar|thur, "what combination has been formed again&s;t us! or rather, my friend, how &s;hort is the fore&s;ight? how frail the wi&s;dom
<PB N="576" REF="586">of mortals to pronounce what is mo&s;t for their happine&s;s! I &s;igh, &s;ir; mine eyes have wept at what I have already &s;een,&mdash; my heart &s;wells while I &s;peak, yet I know not how I may offend the all-di&s;po&s;er, by thus lamenting his heavenly will;&mdash;ah! who &s;hall dare to &s;ay that the &s;eemingly agonizing turns of life, the heavie&s;t depri|vations of death, the early a&s;cen&s;ion of Olivia to heaven, and the eternal retire|ment of Caroline from the world, are not ble&s;&s;ings at which we &s;hould rejoice, and at which it is impious to repine?"</P>
<P>Henry had de&s;ired True George, and the lieutenant, to lead him to Arthur immediately on the colonel's leaving the room, &s;o that he came into the parlour time enough to hear great part of what the holy father had &s;aid. He attempted not to controvert the rea&s;on|ing; he di&s;puted not the piety of the re|flections, but faint, weak, and de&s;pairing, he implored Arthur to &s;ave him if it were yet within his power&mdash;"And if it be not," exclaimed the unfortunate, "I have a thought which I hope, without outrage to God or
<PB N="577" REF="587">man, I may indulge&mdash;'tis my only alterna|tive: yet it &s;hall be done. Father I am re&s;olved."</P>
<P>This was uttered betwixt wildne&s;s, and collected &s;olemnity, but the effect was awe|ful. "Hear me with fortitude and patience," &s;aid Arthur, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Henry, after a profound pau&s;e&mdash;"all that I can I will. There is but one being whom I would &s;erve and obey with more willingne&s;s than Henry Fitzorton. The meek and pious Caroline Stuart, for the rea&s;ons &s;he has a&s;|&s;igned, has withdrawn her&s;elf from the world: &s;he has nearly performed her novi|tiate. Her year of probation expires on the morrow." "The morrow!" exclaimed Henry&mdash;"Even &s;o my child&mdash;we are in the eve of everla&s;ting &s;eclu&s;ion," &s;aid Arthur. "O God!" cried Henry&mdash; "She has already &s;ignified her &s;olemn intention to take the veil, and is upon the point of pronouncing her vows." Henry could &s;carcely be held from &s;inking to the ground, though Denni&s;on and Flore&s;co were a&s;&s;i&s;ting True George to &s;upport him: for the lieutenant was hardly
<PB N="578" REF="588">able to &s;u&s;tain him&s;elf: and John was un|u&s;ually di&s;turbed. "This night, however, at the twelfth hour I am to meet her in the con|fe&s;&s;ional after midnight prayers: I have here a copy of her profe&s;&s;ion of faith. Indulge not the&s;e fal&s;e hopes, &s;hould &s;he &s;tand &s;olemnly fixed to her purpo&s;e. I will not, dare not, inter|rupt it." Henry chilled with horror. "But there are yet &s;ome hours betwixt the prepa|ration and the act," &s;aid the monk: "the choice of becoming a reclu&s;e, or of return|ing to the world is &s;till left her; and although it is unu&s;ually late to place even in the view of a devotee any temporal &s;cenes or ob|jects, that may lead her back to &s;ublunary feelings&mdash;and &s;till more uncommon for her confe&s;&s;or to bring them under her eyes, I &s;till hold it innocent to let her know that great and extraordinary events have taken place at Fitzorton ca&s;tle.&mdash;Nay, I will offer her the peru&s;al of her benefactor the colonel's letter, and then leave her &s;pirit free to act upon the whole of the circum&s;tances. It is a ca&s;e of affliction and of love, my children, apart from all others I have known, and I
<PB N="579" REF="589">will &s;hew it peculiar indulgence. But I mu&s;t inhibit all effu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion, and expect you will all remain unob&s;erved, and undi&s;|covered, in this hou&s;e, which I have bor|rowed of my ancient friend, the abbot of the priory. Yet remember Caroline Stuart has, for twelve hard-tried months, conformed to an order not lenient, though not rigorous: &s;he is preparing to embrace yet more au&s;teri|ties. She is even now to be looked upon as a being nearly out of the pale of terre&s;trial things. I mu&s;t not have her &s;en&s;ibility &s;educed. One &s;trong and deciding que&s;tion &s;hall be put to her, even in this the mo&s;t holy, and aweful moment of her life; if &s;he an&s;wers in favour of the world, &s;he &s;hall re|ceive no di&s;countenance; if &s;he has &s;o &s;ettled her &s;teadfa&s;t &s;oul that all earthly objects&mdash; even tho&s;e once mo&s;t precious&mdash;have receded from her&mdash;and &s;uch in&s;tances are not rare&mdash; even in the reign of beauty and of youth I have &s;een them fade away, and become ex|tingui&s;hed &mdash;&s;hould that be the ca&s;e with the devoted Caroline, not one per&s;ua&s;ive word &s;hall be u&s;ed by me to over-rule her election. I can
<PB N="580" REF="590">no more, my love, my gratitude, and my compa&s;&s;ion, will have done their utmo&s;t."</P>
<P>"Hark!" exclaimed Arthur, "that is the clock of her convent. It is only a few paces di&s;tant from this hou&s;e, a door of the priory opens on it. Li&s;ten. It is the twelfth hour. &mdash;I mu&s;t obey its &s;ummons. Caroline is exact."</P>
<P>The &s;ounds entered the &s;oul of every hearer&mdash;and the pious man, after a&s;&s;uring his friends he would return to them with a faith|ful report, and exhorting them to believe, that whatever direction it might take would be ultimately the be&s;t, he commended their &s;pirits to the angel of peace, and pa&s;&s;ing from the abbot's hou&s;e into the priory, en|tered the convent of vi&s;itation where Caro|line was enclo&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE terrors of &s;u&s;pence have been ju&s;tly numbered among&s;t the lea&s;t &s;upport|able of the mi&s;eries of life. Never could they have been felt more acutely than they
<PB N="581" REF="591">were by the &s;orrowful &s;ociety which now filled the hou&s;e which Arthur had borrowed of his epi&s;copal friend. Nor could any member of that &s;ociety offer &s;ub&s;tantial con&s;olation to the other. The aged Denni&s;on knew that Caroline, had &s;he not been his attendant, nay his nur&s;e, during a &s;ickne&s;s which he him&s;elf had &s;uffered, would have &s;ecluded her&s;elf &s;ome weeks &s;ooner: Flore&s;co's hone&s;t nature could only lead him, in this in&s;tance, to &s;ilent prayer&mdash;for he had li&s;tened to his ma&s;ter's words, which &s;unk into his heart as the words of him who&s;e law they expounded: the apothecary and John Fitzorton, were too well acquainted with the con&s;tancy of Caro|line Stuart to ground a rea&s;onable hope, or, indeed, almo&s;t to &s;uffer any hope, that her confe&s;&s;or would repre&s;ent the change of affairs, with &s;uch moving circum&s;tances, as to war|rant any change in his devotee. The lieute|nant was &s;ilent, and aba&s;hed, from a &s;en&s;e of his own former irreverent behaviour:&mdash;and Henry, who had long &s;ince believed no inci|dent of the future could exceed, or even equal, the pa&s;t in that &s;ickne&s;s of conjecture
<PB N="582" REF="592">and of dread, which uncertainty occa&s;ions, now found that the interval betwixt the de|parture and the return of the confe&s;&s;or from the convent of the confe&s;&s;ed, was the mo&s;t tremendous point of time in his life. The &s;olemn pau&s;e was variou&s;ly filled up by the expectants. The colonel retired to a remote corner of the room, covered his eyes with his hands, and, except now and then &s;tarting up to pre&s;s the hand of his brother, remained fixed in thought. Denni&s;on and Flore&s;co, &s;omewhat relieved them&s;elves by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the &s;ervant of the hou&s;e to prepare refre&s;hments. Henry walked backwards and forwards, or &s;at abruptly down&mdash;now uplifted, and now wrung his hands&mdash;but when the table was covered, and he had taken a chair near it to re&s;t upon one of his arms, he heard a feeble &s;ound, yet rather of joy than &s;adne&s;s, come from under the table, and in the next in&s;tant he felt the tongue of the animal, from whom the &s;ound had i&s;&s;ued, licking his hand. "Is it po&s;&s;ible," exclaimed Henry, &s;tarting up, "that I &s;hould again embrace thee, little Fitz?
<PB N="583" REF="593">art thou &s;till alive!&mdash;O welcome, welcome! be it a good omen!"</P>
<P>"Yes, him's is alive, poor ickle ting," &s;aid Flore&s;co,&mdash;"him only come from mi&s;|&s;ey's convent the other day&mdash;&s;ee&mdash;good &s;ir &s;quire, that is him's ickle bed&mdash;all &s;atin, and cotton, and wool, as &s;oft as him's own ickle old head&mdash;do but feel him's; and, lookee, &s;ir &s;quire, him's bed is made by him's lady's&mdash;own lady&mdash;and him's was brought here in it by ma&s;ter, our good, good father Arthur, under him's cloak."</P>
<P>As Flore&s;co brought forward a light to in|&s;pect the &s;paniel's bed, Henry knew it to be the &s;ame which he had &s;een in early days&mdash;a device of the dove and the olive, emblems of love and peace, and the initial letters H and C, twined, and yet cautiou&s;ly involved in well-wrought laurel leaves, had, at once, noted and concealed their true hearts' my&s;|tery. Henry held the candle clo&s;e to ex|amine &mdash;"Alas! they are almo&s;t worn out! See brother&mdash;&s;ee my good old Denni&s;on, the initials are divided&mdash;the H is faintly &s;ha|dowed. Look, it hangs only by a few trem|bling
<PB N="584" REF="594">threads&mdash;even like the hope&mdash;the life&mdash; of him whom it repre&s;ents&mdash;and the once enwreathed C, is gone for ever! Behold! not a trace remains. And why, poor Fitz, wert thou brought hither? Surely, thou woulde&s;t have been a &s;olace&mdash;even a dear companion of thy cloy&s;tered mi&s;tre&s;s."&mdash; "Alas! for that very rea&s;on," &s;aid Den|ni&s;on, "was he re&s;igned! He too much reminded her of the world&mdash;&s;he had made it her duty to forget; and &s;he knew he would here both live and die in peace." Henry was too much affected by the motive of &s;end|ing the dog out of the convent to attend to any thing more on that &s;ubject; but another drew all his attention. Denni&s;on had di&s;|appeared at the end of his la&s;t &s;peech, but returned in a few minutes bringing under his arm a &s;mall box, on which were written the words&mdash; <HI>'Things precious.'</HI> "This, my good and dear ma&s;ters, contains what I would it were po&s;&s;ible to return to her who has de|po&s;ited them; but &s;hould the great and good director of all determine otherwi&s;e, they are to be di&s;po&s;ed of according to my lady
<PB N="585" REF="595">Caroline's written reque&s;ts within." Henry eagerly, yet fearfully opened the lid&mdash;and as well as agitation, too big for words, would permit, he in&s;pected the contents; &s;ome of which&mdash;for all, were &s;eparate and appropri|ated &mdash;were directed to her brother, among&s;t the&s;e were the miniature gifts of her mother, mentioned in a former part of this hi&s;tory, and &s;ome other reliques of her family. Some were addre&s;&s;ed to Mrs. Herbert, &s;ome to Johanna&mdash;&s;ome to Olivia, others to Arthur, to be di&s;po&s;ed of for the u&s;e of her pen&s;ion|ers, a &s;mall packet to each of the apothe|cary's family; her watch to Jane Atwood&mdash; To John Fitzorton an emblematical de&s;ign of her own painting, repre&s;enting the Angel of Forgivene&s;s receiving from the Angel of Peni|tence a &s;croll, on which the words&mdash;'Pardon and Friend&s;hip' were curiou&s;ly tinted, and un|derneath the illu&s;tration of two figures with hands joined, repre&s;enting their two fathers. At the bottom of the box was found a pacquet &s;uper&s;cribed&mdash;"Henry's." He had begun to fear that, among&s;t the&s;e &s;olemn arrange|ments,
<PB N="586" REF="596">he &s;hould find no memorial for him|&s;elf; and though it is but a melancholy evidence of good will to receive on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the heart feels an aggravation of its woe to be left without its tribute. He opened it in ha&s;te, and perceived very &s;triking re&s;emblances of Olivia and both his children cut out with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, from a remembrance, and a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of their features&mdash;a few lines were written in the envelope, which covered this little gift.&mdash; "May the be&s;t of men live long to ble&s;s the be&s;t of women, and of wives! the lovelie&s;t of children!&mdash;the noble&s;t of brothers!&mdash; &s;uch &s;hall uncea&s;ingly be the prayer of the heaven-devoted Caroline Stuart!" "But, I fear, I have done what I ought not," &s;aid Denni&s;on&mdash;"the&s;e were not to be forwarded to any of the parties concerned till after to|morrow:" &mdash;"To-morrow!" cried Henry,&mdash; "when my lady Caroline had pa&s;&s;ed her vow," re&s;umed Denni&s;on,&mdash;"then, too, I was to have &s;ent to my dear ma&s;ter, the lieu|tenant, his &s;i&s;ter's la&s;t will and te&s;tament,
<PB N="587" REF="597">wherein &s;he has done all things worthy of her; and though &s;he has appointed her brother to &s;ee her general loving kindne&s;s fulfilled, &s;he has named &s;quire Henry, and madam Olivia, to di&s;tribute her bounty to her pen&s;ioners; and, as I cannot expect, indeed, as I do not wi&s;h," &s;aid the veteran, "to live long in the world after &s;he has bid it farewell, if that &s;hould be God's good plea&s;ure, I mean that my little <HI>modicums</HI> &s;hould go in the &s;ame channel, plea&s;e your honours&mdash;yet I wi&s;h I had not mentioned the&s;e things now, as I &s;ee it has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed us, though I thought, while his reverence was gone to know our fate, it might make us le&s;s &s;orrowful to ob&s;erve how my lady, whom we all know and love, has ordered every thing for her friends in the world, even as if her convent was her cof|fin, and, to be &s;ure, it is pretty much the &s;ame &s;ort of matter." It is certain, Denni&s;on could not have related a more unlikely &s;et of occurrences to exhilarate the &s;pirits of his drooping friends, as, indeed, the tremblings which &s;eized his own aged limbs, and the tears which fell from his old eyes, might te&s;|tify,
<PB N="588" REF="598">yet he meant it all in love. "There's not a doubt remaining," &s;aid Henry, "all is over!&mdash;the&s;e are proofs." "And if they be, we mu&s;t learn to re&s;ign," an&s;wered John Fitzorton. "We mu&s;t not be unworthy the example of a tender, &s;olitary, &s;elf-&s;u&s;taining young woman&mdash;arou&s;e, my brother: let us again examine, and with the minds of men and of chri&s;tians, the arguments of her whom we thus mourn after and arraign. Her own explanations of her&s;elf have not even yet been duly attended to. We received them in the hour of confu&s;ion, and read them in that of terrour and de&s;pair." The colonel, conceiving the peru&s;al of Caroline's letter might now produce a good effect on them all, read it aloud, holding his dejected brother by the hand. It was addre&s;&s;ed to&mdash;</P>

I have even to the good and holy Arthur only &s;ignified my intentions, and call|ed on him to give me, not advice, but a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance: that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which to have refu&s;ed, would have rendered him unworthy any longer to be my &s;piritual guide, and have compelled me to &s;eek another. My de&s;igns were formed in &s;ilent thought, and eloquence or remon&s;trance would have alike been vain, had he attempted to u&s;e them as weapons again&s;t my re&s;olves.

<P>According to the ceremonies of our faith I have entered the&s;e walls&mdash;and finding many rea&s;ons to be &s;atisfied with my election, and not one to counterpoi&s;e it,&mdash;my purpo&s;e is to cover my&s;elf meekly with the eternal veil, <HI>before</HI> the time of your receiving the&s;e informations.

<P>The withdrawing my&s;elf from the a&s;y|lum which the pure&s;t benevolence &s;o long afforded me, every circum&s;tance attaching to which I loved, could only be excu&s;ed by the fear that my own weak &s;tate, yet

<P>MEANTIME the good father Arthur joined fervently in the midnight prayers of the convent, fitting his &s;oul for every pious work. He &s;upplicated for that power of impartial judgment, and of equal mini&s;tra|tion, that, while it removes the mi&s;ts of &s;en&s;e, and elevates the &s;pirit beyond the &s;eduction of mortal things, extingui&s;hes not the prin|ciple of humanity, which even in the bo&s;om of holine&s;s, reminds us we are men: and after remaining in the chapel till the nuns and &s;i&s;ters were gone, each to her humble cham|ber, he repaired to the confe&s;&s;ional.</P>
<P>Caroline was already there kneeling before figures of the Virgin, and of her immortal Son. Her countenance was marked by awe, mingled with &s;erenity. She appeared to have &s;ubdued tho&s;e heavy conflicts of the &s;oul, which u&s;ually precede the &s;olemn act of re|nouncing the world, while we are con&s;cious there remains in it many objects precious to

<P>She ro&s;e to receive Arthur, when &s;he had clo&s;ed her meditation. "My dear, my vir|tuous, my ever, ever-beloved child," &s;aid the &s;acred man&mdash;"the great and deci&s;ive moment of your exi&s;tence is at hand: I will not a&s;k if you are fitted to meet it, for your life has been one of voluntary di&s;cipline, and
<PB N="595" REF="605">earne&s;t preparation." "I hope it has, and I look forward to the ceremony which is this morning to take place, with a complacence that augments as that hour comes nearer." The father began to confe&s;s her, and finding in all her re&s;pon&s;es and avowals, as to the ordi|nary que&s;tions, he began to fulfil the pro|mi&s;e he had made to the friends he had left at the priory. "All this is well," ob&s;erved Arthur, "but tell me, daughter, if the mo|tives, laudable as they were, which led thee to the refuge of the&s;e &s;heltering walls, were removed"&mdash;"Ought my &s;acred friend," interrupted Caroline, "to propo&s;e a que&s;tion which revives &s;uch themes, at &s;uch a mo|ment? father, my motives remain, and the re&s;olves formed upon them are, even like them, immovable."</P>
<P>"But if," proceeded Arthur, "they were all removed, by him to whom the &s;teadfa&s;t mountain is as the bending &s;hrub that trembles at its ba&s;e&mdash;if that power by whom the fabric of the univer&s;e changes its place, or di&s;&s;olves to the touch&mdash;if he &s;hould have prepared for my daughter, that peace

<P>"Olivia dead!" ejaculated Caroline.</P>
<P>"To expre&s;s," continued Arthur, "that circum&s;tances would allow her children to find a &s;econd mother in her friend"&mdash;</P>
<P>"O, they will find her in many friends!" cried Caroline.&mdash;"And that friend was de|&s;cribed to be Caroline Stuart," ob&s;erved the father&mdash;"how then would &s;he determine?"</P>
<P>"According to the principles of her own un&s;haken faith, which never would inter|rupt tho&s;e of the prote&s;tant father of pro|te&s;tant children.

<P>"Be it &s;o, my child, retire to thy place of repo&s;e, and of meditation, there examine the great and momentous truths which the&s;e papers will convey&mdash;there commune with thine own heart&mdash;and if on the evidence of tho&s;e truths, it no longer appears a mea&s;ure of wi&s;dom or of piety to circum&s;cribe thy powers of conferring happine&s;s, and of doing good, to the narrow bounds of this holy place, thou wilt order its gates to unclo&s;e, and either meet me at the priory hou&s;e, where I will abide thy coming, or &s;end to me the &s;ummons to attend the ceremony of thy eternal vows."</P>
<P>The blamele&s;s father led her out of the confe&s;&s;ional into the convent, and feeling that he had no power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting her choice, he ble&s;&s;ed her, and departed.</P>

<P>WHEN father Arthur returned to his friends, he found that none of them had re|tired to re&s;t, nor even &s;at down to any re|fre&s;hment; but that every one was wound up by expectation and &s;olicitude to the high|e&s;t pitch of tho&s;e corroding powers: he &s;aluted them with his wonted benignity, but, alas! he was inve&s;ted with no authority to put an end to their &s;u&s;pence. He offered, however, in relief of it, a faithful detail of what had pa&s;t in the confe&s;&s;ional: with firmne&s;s, he gave the feelings of the reclu&s;e, and concluded by ob&s;erving, that he had left in her hands, not only the letter which had been brought by the lieutenant from the colonel, but all the other pacquets which had been collecting, whether kept back by di&s;cretion, or retarded by accident; "in &s;hort," &s;aid the pious father, "I have deli|vered to her contemplation all that it was proper for her to know, and concealed only
<PB N="599" REF="609">what might have unduly influenced her elec|tion." As he fini&s;hed his account, there was &s;till left &s;ufficient to torture and to ap|pea&s;e conjecture; &s;olemn &s;ilence, invaded only by the &s;ighs of Henry, prevailed throughout the a&s;&s;embly. Arthur threw a beam of &s;un-&s;hine over the pro&s;pect, by ob|&s;erving, that though in no degree receding from her point, &s;he gave her utmo&s;t atten|tion to all he had to report, and that while &s;he pre&s;erved unwarped the &s;obriety of her mind, &s;he di&s;played and made no attempt to repel the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart: and in that ju&s;t poi&s;e of faculty and feeling&mdash;the mo&s;t to be de&s;ired, when an aweful deci&s;ion is to be made,&mdash;he &s;aid, he left her.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time &s;ince his entrance into the abbot's hou&s;e, Henry &s;miled, as if he caught a pa&s;&s;ing ray from that far di&s;tant, yet cheering hope: the good father ven|tured to clear the pro&s;pect yet more: the generous Denni&s;on whi&s;pered Henry, that his honour &s;hould con&s;ider that fir&s;t love was not &s;oon forgotten. The kind Flore&s;co, al|mo&s;t imperceptibly approaching the only
<PB N="600" REF="610">di&s;engaged ear of Henry, Denni&s;on remaining at the other&mdash;humbly remarked "that the good God had taken away poor ickle negro|man's dear heart&mdash;dear Loraida, and yet good father Arthur had made him tink God is good God &s;till, &s;o ickle negroman only tries to make him's &s;oul like white chri&s;tian man's &s;oul, that him may &s;ee hims only love in happy place."&mdash;The lieutenant held one of the hands of his friend, and often pre&s;&s;ed it to his bo&s;om. The colonel took the other, from time to time whi&s;pering&mdash;"Let what will be the i&s;&s;ue, remember me!" Thus partly by remon&s;trance, and partly by hope, though each was &s;light yet, as the &s;park if nur&s;ed cautiou&s;ly, and &s;upplied, will afford &s;ome warmth, and &s;ome light, even if it baffles all care in the end, Henry &s;uf|fered him&s;elf awhile to be comforted; in&s;o|much that Arthur per&s;uaded him to &s;et his friends a &s;ocial example by &s;itting down to the humble repa&s;t.</P>
<P>The morning hours, however, cha&s;ed one another away without producing any &s;ort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reply from the devotee; the day had already
<PB N="601" REF="611">dawned. Every vigilant eye and watchful ear of Arthur's party remained unclo&s;ed. Even the good father him&s;elf, who&s;e attem|pered &s;pirit had been long armed again&s;t the power of the general invaders of our brief life's tranquillity, was too &s;incerely intere&s;ted in the event of Caroline's deci&s;ion, to court that repo&s;e, or indeed, to partake of that re|fre&s;hment, which health and virtue rarely denied him: and although he had ble&s;&s;ed the board, and he regarded as his children all that were a&s;&s;embled, the viands were &s;erved, but unta&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the meantime, the fair devout was em|ployed in contemplations of the highe&s;t im|port. When &s;he had reached her cell&mdash;and never did ve&s;tal enter with a purer &s;pirit, and &s;omewhat re&s;umed her&s;elf, &s;he &s;at down by her lamp, not di&s;compo&s;ed, nor yet di&s;|ordered. She opened the papers which Ar|thur had left with her, not with an un&s;teady hand, yet not without &s;omething of tremor. Pre&s;&s;ing her cro&s;s, and bending to her cruci|fix, &s;he ro&s;e ha&s;tily, and kneeling down, &s;ought &s;upport from him who alone can give
<PB N="602" REF="612">it. She returned to her &s;eat, and unfolding all the letters without he&s;itation, took up one at hazard; it happened to be that which John had entru&s;ted to the conveyance of her bro|ther, a peru&s;al of which, indeed, rendered the re&s;t iterative and &s;uperfluous. As we tru&s;t that it has not left the reader's memory, we &s;hall only note that after having read it thrice, &s;he &s;at ruminating on the varied wonders it contained.</P>
<P>She re&s;umed once more the &s;ame letter, and although generally impre&s;&s;ive, one pa&s;|&s;age was particularly dwelt upon, and when &s;he had paid it more attention than the re&s;t, though, in truth, the point which &s;o much engaged her con&s;i&s;ted but of a &s;ingle word, &s;he imagined her lamp grew unu&s;ually dim, but after trimming it, &s;he perceived the ob|&s;truction of light came from her own eyes, for one of their tears had fallen upon that very word. Almo&s;t, in&s;tantly, on her di&s;|covery of this, &s;he folded up the letter with a re&s;olved hand, and although &s;he acknow|ledged in the &s;uper&s;cription of the others the well-known characters of her long-lo&s;t
<PB N="603" REF="613">companions, Mrs. Herbert and Johanna, and one from Charles, her much-loved brother, &s;he wrapt them in the general cover, under which &s;he had received them, and left her cell.</P>
<P>The indeci&s;ive anxieties had &s;o accumulated in the minds of the &s;ociety at the priory, as the broad day came on, that each individual examined the almo&s;t hopele&s;s countenance of the others for relief, and found it not. The eighth hour was &s;ounded from the convent, and that it had been under&s;tood was the time appointed for the ceremony. Henry ru&s;hed out, as he &s;aw &s;ome lay &s;i&s;ters pa&s;&s;ing from one of the &s;treets with &s;mall ba&s;kets in their hands: Hurrying towards them as they were ringing at the outer gate of the con|vent, he ob&s;erved that the ba&s;kets were filled with the flowers of the &s;ea&s;on, to &s;trew the floor of the ve&s;tal as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed to the altar.&mdash; He &s;eized one of the ba&s;kets, and gra&s;ping what it contained in &s;ilent but profound de|&s;pair, threw them again into the ba&s;ket, which he returned to the a&s;toni&s;hed &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="604" REF="614">"They are to cover then, eternally, the corp&s;e of Caroline," exclaimed he. The trem|bling &s;i&s;ter took refuge within the half-opened gate, which was clo&s;ed again in a moment.</P>
<P>Smiting his brea&s;t, the forlorn Henry turn|ed again towards the door of the hou&s;e, and perceived him&s;elf &s;urrounded by his &s;ympa|thizing friends; but the maje&s;tic Arthur ex|horted him to re&s;pect the decrees of the Omnipotent, whatever they might &s;ugge&s;t to the per&s;on he bewailed; ob&s;erving, that if his pa&s;&s;ion was virtuous it would not &s;hrink from the trials of virtue; and if the happine&s;s of Caroline was precious, he would be content to let her pur&s;ue it according to the dictate of her own con&s;cience. "Brother, remember me!" reiterated John. Henry returned into the abbot's hou&s;e, and endea|voured to compo&s;e him&s;elf&mdash;&s;trode along the apartment&mdash;took up the poor &s;paniel, which had attempted, in vain, to follow his ma&s;ter's irregular movements&mdash;and then Henry &s;ighing over him, placed him on his
<PB N="605" REF="615">lap&mdash;Seeing Denni&s;on weep, he dried his tears&mdash;a&s;&s;ured him he was perfectly recon|ciled &mdash;and &s;at him&s;elf down, and &s;obbed with grief. A number of per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ing by the window &s;oon caught his attention; throwing open the window, he perceived them dre&s;&s;ed as for the &s;olemnity&mdash;and moving towards the convent.&mdash;Again, Henry ru&s;hed forth, he que&s;tioned one of the a&s;&s;embly&mdash;they were friends or kindred of the &s;i&s;ters, or nuns, who have permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the ceremony of a novitiate, who is to take the vows&mdash;and were fearful of being too late. Some of the vi&s;itors had gained admittance, while the per&s;on interrogated was &s;peaking. Others were hurrying in. Henry ran forward to the gate of the convent, while it was yet receiv|ing the invited gue&s;ts. The notes of the organ, mingling with the chant of &s;ome prie&s;ts who were ju&s;t arrived in the cloy&s;ters of the convent, &s;truck like thunder on the ear of Henry&mdash;he attempted to precipitate him&s;elf within the portals, but they had received all who were to pa&s;s&mdash;and were &s;hut a &s;econd time again&s;t him. He &s;truggled to the bell,
<PB N="606" REF="616">and rung it&mdash;in vain: the moment was pa&s;&s;|ed &mdash;His &s;urrounding friends, and the gather|ing multitude, &s;aved him from da&s;hing him|&s;elf with de&s;perate rage again&s;t the ma&s;&s;y nails that projected from the convent gate.&mdash; "Hark! hark!" &s;aid he,&mdash;"the bell tolls; it is the funeral of the barbarous Caroline Stuart!"</P>
<P>While his friends, who had all followed, were conveying him from the a&s;toni&s;hed croud, the gate of the convent was again opened by the portere&s;s, and a monk i&s;&s;uing forth, de&s;ired to be conducted to father Arthur; but &s;oon perceiving him; he advanced towards him, exclaiming with a loud voice&mdash;"Father, your pre&s;ence is immediately demanded in the convent of the vi&s;itation: not a moment may be lo&s;t." Arthur in&s;tantly accompanied the monk, and the de&s;pairing Henry, who in|di&s;tinctly heard the &s;ummons, was too much over-come even to &s;truggle any longer, and was carried, as if &s;tiffened by death, into the abbot's hou&s;e.</P>

<P>No &s;ooner had father Arthur gained the interior of the convent, than he found the &s;i&s;ters, the nuns, the chief prie&s;t, and St. Seraphina, the &s;uperior, &s;tanding con|fu&s;ed, and in di&s;order, in the chapel: every thing was in preparation for the ceremony: the floor &s;trewed, the carpet on which, ac|cording to cu&s;tom, the newly-con&s;ecrated nun was to fall; the neck and head-dre&s;s to change from the novitiate white veil to the black, appointed to be worn by the nuns of the order, were ready. The belt and beads were placed on the altar, one of the &s;i&s;ters was tolling the bell, to give warning to the votary, that the holy a&s;&s;ociation were wait|ing to hear, and to record her vows. As &s;oon as Arthur made his appearance, the principal abbe&s;s came forward to inform him that his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary, to enforce the obedience of the novice, whom he had recommended to her convent, a&s;&s;erting, that
<PB N="608" REF="618">&s;he had come forward with objections when it was too late to admit them, and that &s;he had re&s;i&s;ted every holy authority, and re|pelled every &s;acred exhortation with a pride and confidence utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with a ve&s;tal, and with the meek and unobtru&s;ive demeanour &s;he had ob&s;erved during her whole novitiate. "She has refu&s;ed even to make her appearance," &s;aid the abbe&s;s. As Arthur was about to reply, Caroline her&s;elf entered the chapel, and bending with unaf|fected reverence to the altar, and with due regard to the &s;anctity of the place, declared "that &s;he felt the mo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled &s;orrow that the conduct of one &s;he had &s;o long re|verenced, and whom &s;till &s;he loved and ho|noured, had rendered it nece&s;&s;ary," &s;he &s;aid, "to obtrude her&s;elf, at &s;uch a moment, and in &s;uch a pre&s;ence, on the judgment of the a&s;&s;embly." After this exordium, &s;he informed Arthur, that having peru&s;ed &s;ome of the papers he had left for her meditation, &s;he had repaired, even &s;o early as the fourth hour, to the chamber of Saint Seraphina, whom &s;he found &s;till at her devotions; that
<PB N="609" REF="619">&s;he had &s;tated with candour the unexpected motives which made it nece&s;&s;ary to clo&s;e the terms of her conventual life with the mo|ment that clo&s;ed her novitiate&mdash;even the moment in which &s;he was making the decla|ration &mdash;and at the &s;ame time informed the &s;uperior, that although many of the circum|&s;tances which formed the&s;e motives, being wholly of a dome&s;tic and private nature, were too delicate for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;he re|ferred her to father Arthur for her ju&s;tifi|cation, in demanding the privilege of with|holding her vows, and of quitting the &s;i&s;terhood, under his holy protection: hum|bly expre&s;&s;ing a hope that &s;he might leave her embrace and ble&s;&s;ing with every re&s;pect|ed individual of the community. The preparations were, however, &s;uffered to proceed, the right of election was di&s;puted, and the good and beneficent St. Seraphina, who had been to me," &s;aid Caroline, "till that moment, as a friend and a parent, taxed me with caprice, irreverence and impiety."</P>
<P>"It was but her grief," &s;aid Arthur, be|nignly, "her grief to part from you, my
<PB N="610" REF="620">daughter: &s;he felt that &s;he found in your &s;ociety the endearment of a child, and to be &s;uddenly bereaved of it, even in the hour that &s;he had told her heart you would re|main with her for the re&s;t of your life, gave to her zeal, prompted by her affection, an earne&s;tne&s;s for which your love and re&s;pect mu&s;t allow&mdash;but &s;i&s;ter Seraphina can require only a moment's recollection of her&s;elf to know that forced vows are unacceptable to the power to whom they are offered&mdash;that faith con&s;trained encourages hypocri&s;y, and that every act that chains the mind is impious: our &s;i&s;ter is not to learn be&s;ides, that freedom of choice during the year of experiment and probation gives to every votary the power of returning to &s;ociety, or of remaining &s;ecluded; and it has often hap|pened, as in the ca&s;e before us, that a change of circum&s;tances warrants a change of conduct; all the virtues, it is true, are like God him&s;elf, who is their fountain, in|variable and eternal; but the &s;ame principles which, at one time, conduct a novice to the cloy&s;ter may lead her again into the world.
<PB N="611" REF="621">I am here to vouch, my &s;i&s;ter, that many &s;uch circum&s;tances have ari&s;en to determine our virtuous daughter to leave this holy man&s;ion: but, in leaving it, &s;he departs not from the ble&s;&s;ed power to whom it is dedi|cated. Si&s;ter Seraphina is not among&s;t tho&s;e mi&s;guided zealots of our per&s;ua&s;ion, or of any other, who believe that the omnipre&s;ent deity can be &s;erved only within the pale of their own convents, or in that of the catholic or prote&s;tant church. Happier if every wor|&s;hipper has acce&s;s to his prop&eacute;r temple; but true religion, my &s;i&s;ter knows, like the &s;ublime &s;pirit that in&s;pires it, is not to be circum|&s;cribed: the veritable God is to be found, and a temple may be rai&s;ed to him, in every part of his univer&s;e. Let us not narrow his &s;acred pre&s;ence, even to that bound, &s;ince, pa&s;&s;ing the limit of our contracted globe, in&s;ufficient, alas! to fill even our finite idea of the unmea&s;ured authority and government of his power, his benevolence, and his wi&s;dom, he &s;preads him&s;elf over other worlds as incalculable in number, as impartial in the diffu&s;ion of his holy &s;pirit:
<PB N="612" REF="622">and doubtle&s;s, in every part of the&s;e regions, the votary may, with equal &s;incerity, and with equal certainty of being heard, erect his altar and offer up his prayer.&mdash;This, our daughter," added Arthur, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, "I pledge my&s;elf, can always be happy in th a&s;&s;urance that &s;he is every where in the guard, and under the &s;acred eye of her Creator. She has rai&s;ed to his glory a &s;hrine in her heart, and were &s;he &s;hut out from every other &s;anc|tuary, and bereft of the &s;ight of all tho&s;e holy emblems, figures, and ceremonies, which we humbly tru&s;t are &s;ymbols as innocent as we find them impre&s;&s;ive&mdash;although, God for|bid! we &s;hould impo&s;e them as fetters on our brethren, who have rejected them!&mdash;were, I &s;ay, the good daughter who is &s;eparating her&s;elf from this community, to be &s;eparated for ever from the view, al&s;o, of the&s;e;&mdash;be a&s;&s;ured, O &s;i&s;ter in the faith, &s;he would &s;till be con&s;cious of being in the pre&s;ence of the maje&s;ty of heaven, even as &s;he is at this moment, and her adoration would be every where the &s;ame."</P>
<P><PB N="613" REF="623">The &s;urrounding a&s;&s;embly were much awed, and &s;uch as were too bigotted or prejudiced to yield to the matter, were affected by the manner of his harangue. The abbe&s;s for &s;ome moments remained &s;ilent, then going up to Caroline, took her by the hand, and led her to the venerable Franci&s;can. "Bro|ther," &s;aid &s;he, "in re&s;igning this child to your di&s;po&s;al, I give up one of the pure&s;t trea&s;ures of my heart: a trea&s;ure, which if I have attempted to pre&s;erve, it is becau&s;e I could not but deem it too precious to be expo&s;ed again to the perils of the world; haply my &s;elf-love may have, alas! mixed with this motive, for &s;he has taught me to feel that a mother's tenderne&s;s may fill the heart of the patrone&s;s of a cloy&s;ter,&mdash;even as the&s;e human, and I hope, forgiven tears have filled her eyes."</P>
<P>Touched to the rece&s;&s;es of her gentle bo&s;om, Caroline folded her arms in the robes of St. Seraphina, as &s;he bent her knee even to the ground; and then moving to the altar, on which were laid the &s;everal em|blems of ve&s;tal con&s;ecration, &s;he pro&s;trated her&s;elf before the crucifix, and taking up
<PB N="614" REF="624">the pall which was &s;ymbolically to have been thrown over her while &s;he was renouncing the world, "O! till an eternal veil like this," exclaimed &s;he, "&s;hall cover my frame, every holy precept I owe to this pious community &s;hall form the practice of my life:&mdash;and the&s;e, thou honoured pre|ceptor! &mdash;and ye, my beloved &s;i&s;terhood! &s;hall be joined in every prayer, and min|gle in every hope of our everla&s;ting re|union!

<PB N="615" REF="625">had been &s;pread over the carpet, to &s;trew them in the path that again led her into the world.

<P>ARTHUR had deemed it one of the fair and nece&s;&s;ary re&s;erves he had conditioned for, to conceal from Caroline every circum|&s;tance which might bias her deci&s;ion, or practi&s;e on her heart; con&s;equently &s;he had as yet no idea that either her brother or any of her friends were &s;o near at hand; and con&s;cious as he was of the afflicting, but inevitable &s;tate in which he had left tho&s;e, he was anxious to prevent any abrupt di&s;|covery of the important i&s;&s;ue of his return to the convent. She was &s;till in her noviti|ate
<PB N="616" REF="626">dre&s;s, but as Arthur led her by the priory door, he had opportunity to convey his charge into an interior apartment, of which he always kept the keys; beyond which was a &s;mall book-room &s;acred to his own con|templations, and thither he now re&s;orted with Caroline.</P>
<P>Seating him&s;elf be&s;ide her, and in the mo&s;t affectionate manner addre&s;&s;ing her, he briefly but cautiou&s;ly acquainted her with the &s;everal things he had judged it proper to conceal, and when he had carried his conver&s;ation through the &s;everal circum&s;tances that related to her brother's journey and voyage of fra|ternal affection, and the nature and import of his emba&s;&s;y from the ca&s;tle, of the pious death of Olivia, and her la&s;t me&s;&s;age of love mingled with wi&s;hes re&s;pecting the di&s;po&s;al of her hu&s;band and children, he was proceeding to bring down the intelligence nearer to the moment before them, when Caroline inter|po&s;ing, ob&s;erved, that &s;he found all he had been relating, mentioned at length, and with many additional circum&s;tances in the pacquets with which he had pre&s;ented her;
<PB N="617" REF="627">confe&s;&s;ing to him that on the &s;trong oppo|&s;ition of the &s;uperior, and the urgence of &s;everal of the &s;i&s;ters, that &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer the &s;olemnities of the day to proceed, arguing, amid&s;t &s;ighs and tears, that it was an offence to heaven to &s;top them; &s;he had gone back to her cell, and in the profounde&s;t &s;olitude not only read the letter, which had before thrice pa&s;&s;ed her eye, and which till then &s;eemed all-commanding as to the &s;teps &s;he ought to take, but that &s;he peru&s;ed and re-peru&s;ed every other paper, to the intent, &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;acredly of confe&s;&s;ing the er|rour of her deci&s;ion, and blending &s;uch confe&s;&s;ion in her vows, or of being farther convinced her determination to withhold tho&s;e vows, was &s;anctioned by every duty upon earth. "But," &s;aid Caroline,&mdash; "&s;trengthened by all I read, by all I thought, in the belief that I had decided ju&s;tly, I hope it de&s;erves a fairer name than the &s;elf-willed tenacity which had been imputed to me,&mdash; if my re&s;olve then took a form of re&s;i&s;tance which would not have given way to either argument or &s;upplication. I was returning
<PB N="618" REF="628">to the &s;i&s;terhood to repeat my intentions with renovated force, when I &s;aw with the comfort which always attends me in his pre|&s;ence, the friend and guide of my life. You know the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"Then you are &s;ufficiently prepared to hear that the lieutenant, though he did not give you tho&s;e letters, was the bearer of them; that he traced us from our rece&s;s in the happy i&s;le, to our &s;anctuary here; and that finally, he is in this very hou&s;e, attended by your humble, but ever faithful friend, True George."</P>
<P>Although the reader has rea&s;on to know that, yet, with the name of True George, a&s;&s;ociated another name &s;o very powerful, at this &s;ingular moment, that &s;he could not help a&s;king whether &s;he had di&s;tinctly heard what he &s;aid as to her brother's fellow-traveller? "Yes, True George came over with him," replied Arthur, "and &s;ome others."&mdash; "Others!" &s;aid Caroline; "Yes, our pro|tector the colonel &s;oon followed him."&mdash; "John Fitzorton!" exclaimed Caroline, dwelling emphatically on the word&mdash;John!
<PB N="619" REF="629">"how generous, how good, how like him&s;elf! I hope," &s;aid &s;he, he&s;itating, "he left all his friends, all his family well:&mdash;as well, alas! as they can be!" Rightly &s;ugge&s;ting that a managed di&s;covery of the grand deci&s;ion might be no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to Henry than to Caroline, the monk ha&s;tened to the room where the ca&s;tle party had been a&s;&s;embled. He encountered Flore&s;co in his way up &s;tairs. "Ma&s;&s;er a-bed," exclaimed the youth, fear|fully. The monk a&s;cended, and &s;aw his friends &s;urrounding a bed on which they had laid the de&s;pairing Henry, who had manife&s;ted &s;ymp|toms which made them for &s;ome time appre|hend the lo&s;s of his &s;en&s;es; but he &s;oon became more compo&s;ed, and was &s;peaking coherent|ly, when Arthur entered.&mdash;"Fear not, my friends," &s;aid he, "I perceive a path yet left to &s;ave me,&mdash;one which none of you can blame." He lay &s;ome time revolving this new image in his mind, or rather recurring to a preconceived de&s;ign, now to be matured. His tranquillity returned in proportion as he made progre&s;s in his purpo&s;ed plan. At length, with re&s;olution, he ro&s;e from the
<PB N="620" REF="630">bed, and walked backwards and forwards in the room, from time to time a&s;&s;uring his friends he was regaining his peace. "I am &s;ettling my mind," &s;aid he, with di&s;ordered accents; he alternately took the hands of his brother and his friend Charles; as he pa&s;&s;ed to and fro, his countenance became more and more &s;erene, yet tears fell from his eyes, and he &s;ighed as he lay down again on the bed. But, at length, recognizing Arthur, he again ro&s;e impetuou&s;ly. "It is unnece&s;&s;ary to make any report of the event," exclaimed he,&mdash; "I will &s;pare you the particulars. Caroline Stuart has devoted her&s;elf&mdash;yes, your delay&mdash; your &s;ilence&mdash;all which I have &s;een&mdash;heard&mdash; felt&mdash;pronounce my doom. Attend therefore to my &s;olemn determinations; nay, interrupt me not,&mdash;&s;peak not, I implore you, till I have done. I &s;hall want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but it is nothing in which your pure &s;pirit may not engage; and it is the only point that remains to re&s;tore my happine&s;s,&mdash;to recon|cile my &s;oul,&mdash;hear then,&mdash;I conjure you, to hear me!"&mdash;"I will," an&s;wered the worthy prie&s;t with energy, as if anticipating Henry's
<PB N="621" REF="631">ideas; "but, perhaps, it &s;hould be heard with le&s;s hazard of interruption."</P>
<P>The party would have left the room&mdash; "No," cried the monk, "your pre&s;ence may be requi&s;ite, but as we &s;hall be le&s;s di&s;|turbed in one of the lower apartments, I would advi&s;e if my &s;on feels him&s;elf &s;trong enough"&mdash;"Strong enough for every thing," an&s;wered Henry, wildly&mdash;"behold I can walk un&s;upported." "This way then my &s;on, and the re&s;t of our friends will follow." They now de&s;cended into the gothick apart|ment fronting the &s;treet, where they had be|fore a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>"I have a pre&s;entiment of what revolves in your mind, my &s;on," continued the friar, "and will return in a few moments pre|pared to give you audience." While Arthur ab&s;ented him&s;elf, Henry's whole &s;oul &s;eemed to be employed.</P>
<P>The Franci&s;can meanwhile returned to Caroline, and found her again peru&s;ing the pacquets, and &s;ome of that colour which paints the human affections, but which an habitual repre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e affections, and a
<PB N="622" REF="632">life &s;evere to it&s;elf, expels gradually, even from the heart, had returned into her cheek.</P>
<P>Arthur judged this to be the moment in which more animating tidings might be &s;afely communicated&mdash;he extended the plea&s;ing news, by informing her that he could now promi&s;e her an interview with her brother, and the humble George, as well as with her friend, John Fitzorton, whenever &s;he was pre|pared to admit them. "What preparation can be nece&s;&s;ary, my good father? I entreat of you to let me this moment attend them&mdash; I have ob&s;erved in you an apparent wi&s;h to procra&s;tinate, that alarms me:&mdash;You replied not to my former apprehen&s;ion as to the health of others of our friends. Neither have I been quite candid. Wherefore &s;hould I deal, my good father, with you re&s;ervedly&mdash; the motives, cogent and manifold, which have drawn me from the cloy&s;ter ought to be, and are, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify all the move|ments of my heart&mdash;wherefore then have I &s;o long forborne a more direct enquiry after Henry Fitzorton? I entreat of you to &s;atisfy my &s;olicitude about his health&mdash;but, perhaps,
<PB N="623" REF="633">you wi&s;h the tidings to come to me from his brother or from the colonel?" "I wi&s;h it, my deare&s;t child, to come in a manner the mo&s;t acceptable, and to that end only have I procra&s;tinated. Henry Fitzorton accom|panied the colonel, he too is in the abbot's hou&s;e&mdash;his health, perhaps his rea&s;on, and his life, depend upon his happine&s;s&mdash;his hap|pine&s;s is, I tru&s;t, not remote: he is very near us. I will place you where you &s;hall hear what I have told you confirmed; but whatever you may ob&s;erve I call on that obedience which has, invariably, di&s;tingui&s;hed the conduct of my deare&s;t daughter, to re|tain her &s;tation, unheard, un&s;een, till I give the &s;ignal, and that &s;ignal I pledge my&s;elf &s;hall not be delayed beyond the moment even of her own atte&s;ted &s;atisfaction." The father re-conducted her from the little book-room to the apartment which joined it, and which was divided from the front parlour where Henry and his friends were a&s;&s;embled, only by a &s;light partition, from whence there was a door of communication, and the half of that door was of gla&s;s &s;haded to the extent
<PB N="624" REF="634">of the glazing by a curtain that run upon rings. "Be this your point of unob|&s;erved ob&s;ervation," whi&s;pered the monk, to the agitated Caroline, as he drew a chair im|mediately be&s;ide the curtain. He then went back into the parlour.</P>
<P>Henry had been working up his &s;everal faculties to the bent of his re&s;olve, and he imagined them to be all in &s;o firm a &s;tate, that advancing to Arthur on his entrance, he declared aloud his &s;teadfa&s;t purpo&s;e. "Now then, friend, and holy father, I call upon you in your profe&s;&s;ional office for that aid which it would be derogatory to your character to refu&s;e me. In the fir&s;t place, I bequeath the education of my dear children to tho&s;e I love be&s;t in the world&mdash;&s;ave one who has this cruel morn precipitated her&s;elf out of that world&mdash;my duty to their angel mother, at whatever price, has been fulfilled&mdash;my bo&s;om friend has by a new election regained the path of happine&s;s&mdash;my dear brothers I feel a&s;&s;ured will remain to &s;u&s;tain the honour of my family, to comfort our poor, and become joint guardians of my little ones&mdash;I re&s;olve then
<PB N="625" REF="635">to follow the example of Caroline Stuart &s;o far as to dedicate the re&s;t of my days to mona&s;tic &s;eque&s;tration; and as the faith I have adopted takes no change from the colour of my deep di&s;appointments, but will, I tru&s;t, in time, enable me to &s;upport and &s;ur|vive them&mdash;to &s;urmount them is beyond my hope, beyond even my wi&s;h,&mdash;I determine to join my&s;elf to the fraternity of which you, my reverend father, are a member, even to the holy brotherhood of St. Francis. I am not to learn that a neighbouring mona&s;tery, even in Coutance, is &s;acred to that thrice|ble&s;&s;ed &s;aint; and it will &s;oothe me to be near my Caroline, although the eternal walls, even when heaven it&s;elf which had &s;et us free, &s;hall then again throw over us inextricable chains. Seek not, O my brother and my friends, to oppo&s;e me in this immovable re&s;olve &mdash;place not as ob&s;tacles before its execution the dear, dear objects of my paternal love&mdash; objects which are even new incentives to pro&s;ecute my de&s;ign&mdash;were I de&s;titute of John and James Fitzorton I might &s;truggle &s;till in the weary pilgrimage of the world,
<PB N="626" REF="636">but to them I can confide my trea&s;ures, and, alas! I feel that neither by precept nor ex|ample, could their ill-fated parent any longer a&s;&s;i&s;t their youth; and the affection of their uncles &s;hall &s;oon obliviate all memory of their unhappy father."</P>
<P>Perceiving the colonel had been throwing over the whole of this propo&s;ition the mo&s;t formidable frown, and that he was coming forward with arguments which would de&s;troy his project, "Brother," continued the con|&s;cious Henry, "I &s;ee that you di&s;approve my plan, and that other of my friends de|plore it, but in this one point behold me in|exorable. Receive, then, as &s;olemn pledges of my con&s;idence in you, the &s;on and daughter of a man re&s;olved to quit the world&mdash;you cannot, dare not, refu&s;e me. Guard for them my fortunes. Everla&s;tingly &s;hall they and their protectors, and all pre&s;ent, and all ab|&s;ent, who have a claim on my heart, be in|cluded in my prayers!" An audible and ex|clamatory &s;igh broke from the oppo&s;ite room: &s;uch of the company as heard it looked &s;ome|what &s;tartled on each other. Henry had
<PB N="627" REF="637">pau&s;ed, and ri&s;en from his &s;eat as if uncer|tain of the found, but not again hearing it, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf more immediately to Arthur. "And now father," &s;aid he, "having witne&s;&s;ed my immovable re&s;olu|tion to devote the re&s;t of my days to a &s;eclu|&s;ion, not le&s;s ab&s;olute than that of Caro|line Stuart, who alone could have made the world delightful to me&mdash;now that &s;he, for whom &s;o many years of my life have been pa&s;t in faithful &s;orrow&mdash;now that &s;he has removed her&s;elf for ever&mdash;I call upon you to grant &s;anctuary to a breaking heart&mdash;to afford it a place of refuge. Voluntary has been the profe&s;&s;ion of my faith: voluntary &s;hall be the offering of my&s;elf up to the church which cheri&s;hes it. O ha&s;te me, father, that I may be received into its bo&s;om: and confirm, even now before this a&s;&s;embly of my friends, my holy election."</P>
<P>"I con&s;ent," replied Arthur, who had in vain attempted to &s;peak, "I con&s;ent that Henry Fitzorton, in con&s;ideration of his &s;uf|ferings, and his con&s;tancy for Caroline Stuart, and of his many and hard trials in the years
<PB N="628" REF="638">of his youth, even unto this day, &s;hall follow her example."</P>
<P>The company were amazed. John was ri&s;en to prote&s;t again&s;t the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I con&s;ent," reiterated the Franci&s;can, "and will give my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the render|ing his re&s;olve not le&s;s ab&s;olute than hers, and in de&s;pite of all oppo&s;ition I here pledge my&s;elf, even before the altar, which in the adjoining chapel of the priory has often re|ceived my bending knee, and before the &s;a|cred figures that &s;urround the &s;hrine, and every other witne&s;s who is here pre&s;ent, or within hearing of my voice&mdash;yes, by all the&s;e, I pledge my&s;elf to hear, and to record the vows of Henry, even as I have heard, and recorded tho&s;e of Caroline."</P>
<P>"It may not be," a&s;&s;erted John; "my brother has duties in the world&mdash;the duties of a father, which during that father's life no &s;ub&s;titute can&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e duties &s;hall not &s;uffer by the vows I am determined to &s;anction," rejoined the monk. "Proceed we to the altar: this key will open the door which leads to the chapel."
<PB N="629" REF="639">"I prote&s;t again&s;t the deed," an&s;wered John: "I will not pronounce on the conduct of Caroline, but in my brother a &s;imilar act would be impious."</P>
<P>"And I too wholly di&s;approve it in my &s;i&s;ter," exclaimed the lieutenant: "Are the children of Olivia to be thus neglected?&mdash;are they to be ba&s;ely de&s;erted by their father?" cried John in aweful whi&s;pers&mdash;"O! &s;ainted &s;pirit of the tendere&s;t mother! are thy little ones to become orphans?"</P>
<P>Henry &s;tood irre&s;olute&mdash;Denni&s;on and Flore&s;co wept and prayed&mdash;The apothecary began to plead&mdash;True George had been in balance, whether he &s;hould pur&s;ue the long|trodden &s;teps of his beloved ma&s;ter, or retrace the paths that led to his plighted mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Meantime the key had done its office&mdash; and the monk, firm in his purpo&s;e, had caught one of Henry's hands: John forci|bly &s;eized the other, and began to drag it in an oppo&s;ite direction&mdash;"And is the far-famed father Arthur, like the meane&s;t bigot of his tribe, a man who trades in
<PB N="630" REF="640">conver&s;ion&mdash;an impo&s;er of his faith on the mi&s;guided?&mdash;I am now ju&s;tified in believing my brother has been pro&s;elyted in another point&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Son," an&s;wered the monk, "when a proof of your charge appears, I will ac|knowledge its force; till then no earthly power&mdash;not your's&mdash;whom mo&s;t on earth I venerate&mdash;&s;hall impede my progre&s;s."</P>
<P>"Father aid me to pour forth my un&s;haken intents before the &s;hrine you &s;peak of, as a &s;olemn earne&s;t of my future con&s;ecration; and I &s;hall then feel my&s;elf beyond the reach of this unfair controul. I am re&s;olved."</P>
<P>John, with &s;trong indignation, flung back his brother's hand, and Arthur threw open the folding doors, from which Caroline Stuart, in the almo&s;t in&s;upportable agitation of her feelings and of her frame, had, however, receded. The whole company followed the monk and Henry into the apartment, trembling at every &s;tep. John came after them, with movements that marked his deeply-di&s;turbed mind.</P>
<P>"The chapel is at the end of the&s;e
<PB N="631" REF="641">&s;mall apartments," &s;aid Arthur. He led Henry along, &s;till followed by the re&s;t. They, at length, entered the chapel of the priory: the altar was placed between two broad columns, on each of which were painted, at full length, two &s;acred figures, the one of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, the other of the redeemer of the world. Henry fell on his knees the in&s;tant he came within view of the &s;hrine. Arthur looked around with &s;urpri&s;e, but as he was preparing to &s;peak, a part of Caroline's &s;acred ve&s;tment re|lieved him, and approaching the altar and kneeling al&s;o, he exclaimed, "Now, may the vows of my pious &s;on be no le&s;s ac|ceptable to heaven than tho&s;e of my vir|tuous daughter!"</P>
<P>In&s;tantly from behind that column, which repre&s;ented the virgin, proceeded another &s;igh, &s;o penetrating, &s;o audible, that Henry again &s;tarted up, and &s;tood fixed. "Ble&s;t, yet overwhelming moment!" cried a voice. Henry ran forward, and, in the &s;ucceeding moment, &s;he, from whom the melodious
<PB N="632" REF="642">&s;ounds i&s;&s;ued, &s;prung to &s;ight, and Caroline Stuart &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Unable to &s;upport her various &s;en&s;ations, on hearing the key turning within the lock, and, as the hand of the reverend Arthur was pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the door, &s;he had &s;tarted from her &s;eat, which, as the expre&s;&s;ions &s;he had heard governed her movements, &s;he had alternately left and revi&s;ited.&mdash; Uncon&s;cious of motion, &s;he had continued her retreat from the one apartment to the other: &s;he gained the &s;acred column, and with difficulty &s;upported her&s;elf behind it, overcome with exce&s;s of pure felicity.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment and joy fixed the whole a&s;&s;embly, &s;ave Arthur, in the &s;ame &s;tatue-like po&s;itions. It &s;eemed as if the wand of an enchanter, even with the force of an electric communication, had in that in&s;tant completed its &s;pell: and, indeed, it was magic of the highe&s;t kind, and from the mo&s;t potent hand,&mdash;a touch etherial that chained them for &s;ome minutes to their attitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="633" REF="643">At length Henry called for the aid of John; and the lieutenant ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t the failing &s;teps of his &s;i&s;ter Caroline. But never had there yet been a period, in the life of either, &s;o intere&s;ting, &s;o in&s;upport|able, as that in which Caroline Stuart and Henry Fitzorton were conducted, by their brothers, into the arms of each other!&mdash; Truth, con&s;tancy, approved love, &s;miling pity, con&s;enting virtue, and rewarding piety, mingled in that embrace!&mdash;In one moment the brui&s;ed reed was made whole, and the almo&s;t quenched flax, purged of all its va|pour, kindled into a flame, which burnt pure for ever.</P>
<P>"O! heaven of heavens!" exclaimed Henry, "and thou its pure&s;t pattern upon earth, in&s;pire me with gratitude equal to my tran&s;port&mdash;and with fortitude to en|dure it!" "There, there, my children!" &s;aid the exulting Arthur, pointing to the altar, "mu&s;t you invoke the in&s;piring power." "Yes, he is the &s;ource!" cried Caroline, pre&s;&s;ing her ro&s;ary with one hand,
<PB N="634" REF="644">and with the other leading Henry forward, then kneeling down with all humility, but with returning force, as if be&s;towed from above:&mdash;"HE IS THE SOURCE!" repeated &s;he, "from whence every evil has been averted, or &s;u&s;tained&mdash;and from whence every good has been derived." "Ble&s;&s;ed and adored be that &s;ource for ever!" ex|claimed the monk, cro&s;&s;ing his hands upon his bo&s;om, as he pro&s;trated him&s;elf, and bowing before the &s;hrine with the mo&s;t pro|found reverence; the auditors did the &s;ame, repeating his words: "It is in this &s;acred place then&mdash;in this &s;acred attitude, that the &s;ub&s;tituted vows of Caroline &s;hall be heard and &s;anctified," exclaimed the monk. Then Arthur laid his hand on their heads, breathing over each of them a prayer, which was not without a power derived from the &s;ource he &s;upplicated. In that moment John Fitzorton, and Charles Stuart, who had placed them&s;elves on each &s;ide of the chief objects of the benediction, ro&s;e up&mdash;advanced yet nearer the altar,
<PB N="635" REF="645">and joined the hands of Caroline and Henry; ble&s;&s;ing both and uniting them for ever.</P>
<P>But in the good old Denni&s;on, the youthful Flore&s;co, and the worthy apothe|cary, it was an event that annihilated all words in &s;en&s;ation, even as it had operated in the bli&s;sful &s;ilence of the lovers. In True George its effects were accompanied by emotions &s;o &s;trong, that had they not found mitigation in a &s;hower of tears, which came to his relief as the brothers pronounced the ble&s;&s;ing, he might have fallen a martyr to genuine, but in&s;upport|able joy.</P>
<P>By the friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the bi&s;hop of Cherbourg, and the pious father Arthur, the cu&s;tomary term of re&s;i|dence was &s;hortened, and the marriage &s;olemnized, with all the forms of the catholic religion.</P>

<P>ON returning from the church, where the ceremony was performed, Partington, with Mrs. Herbert, and Johanna, who had been apprized of all the circum&s;tances, by letters from the lieutenant, arrived in time to receive the bride and bridegroom at the door of the abbot's hou&s;e, and a meeting of more genuine &s;atisfaction can never have been witne&s;&s;ed in the annals of mankind. But in happine&s;s, as in grief, the additi|onal drops which may be poured into the cup when we &s;uppo&s;e it incapable of hold|ing more, fully prove how incompetent mortals are to decide upon the power of human minds; or to mea&s;ure the propor|tions they may be called upon, either to enjoy or to endure.</P>
<P>A conference with father Arthur had ex|cited in the bi&s;hop of Coutance, his anci|ent friend, &s;o warm an intere&s;t in the hap|pine&s;s and future fortune of Henry and
<PB N="637" REF="647">Caroline, that to te&s;tify his re&s;pect for their &s;ufferings and their rewards, he expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to receive them at his palace, accompanied by the re&s;t of their party. The prelate's wi&s;hes were conveyed by the monk, who&s;e virtues have &s;o much enriched this hi&s;tory, and the happy, yet grateful Henry, not knowing how far a vi&s;it to a catholic bi&s;hop might be agree|able to the prote&s;tant part of his com|pany, nor pre&s;uming to make his own conver&s;ion a rule of faith to others, looked to his brother for a reply. "I tru&s;t," &s;aid John, kindly an&s;wering to Henry's look, "we can have but one opinion as to the invitation of a venerable man, who &s;eeks to increa&s;e the accumulating honours of that virtue, which has been tried and found faithful&mdash;a man who is al&s;o the friend of father Arthur: whom, indeed," added the colonel, "my unju&s;t &s;u&s;picion has again &s;o wronged, that I can hardly deem my&s;elf a fit a&s;&s;ociate; and &s;hould feel that I ought to bani&s;h my&s;elf from being of the party, did I not know, that I &s;hould thereby
<PB N="638" REF="648">rob &s;o revered, though &s;o outraged, a friend of half the plea&s;ures of a forgiving &s;pirit." John bowed with true humility, and blu&s;hed with generous con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. "My &s;on! my benefactor!" an&s;wered Arthur, "your con|jectures were highly coloured by circum|&s;tance, and your re&s;i&s;tance to apparently undue authority exerci&s;ed on the will of your brother, in two the mo&s;t important concerns of his life&mdash;his affection, and his faith&mdash;was even a fraternal duty. With the la&s;t aweful concern I have nothing to do: with the former I &s;hould not, perhaps, have &s;o long delayed &s;tating the ground on which I &s;tood. I &s;hould have removed your apprehen|&s;ions as to the nature of your brother's vows, and without equivoque have told you, that in imitating tho&s;e which his Caroline had form|ed, he would act under your own &s;anction, of which a written proof had been &s;o recently received from you."</P>
<Q><L>For modes of faith let zealous bigots fight,</L>
<L>His can't be wrong who&s;e life is in the right.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="639" REF="649">
Thus quoted Henry. "I think I have often heard you &s;ay, you fine old caitiff," cried Partington, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Arthur, "that this &s;coundrel of a bi&s;hop, is much &s;uch another fellow as your&s;elf. Let us go to his palace in a body, and &s;end &s;omebody to bid him expect our whole gang."</P>
<P>The invitation was accepted. And in or|der to render the homage to real virtue, which had pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal, more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, the prelate had added to the party many of his own particular friends, yet had not the vi&s;it been marked by &s;omething of yet greater import, to the honour and hap|pine&s;s of the Fitzortons, it would have had no record in the&s;e pages.</P>
<P>After a repa&s;t which ho&s;pitality had pre|pared, and temperance had ble&s;t, the prelate invited his gue&s;ts to a walk in the gardens of his palace; the &s;cenery was of high natural beauty, and cultured with exqui&s;ite ta&s;te; &s;everal per&s;ons were employed in watering the flowers&mdash;but they were as yet at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance, and their features indi&s;tinct. As the party drew &s;omewhat nearer, they
<PB N="640" REF="650">heard the per&s;ons at work &s;inging.&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid the good bi&s;hop to Henry and Caro|line, who happened to be the neare&s;t to him, "that is their u&s;ual way of &s;weetening bu&s;i|ne&s;s with plea&s;ure."&mdash;"Which &s;hews their labours to be light," interpo&s;ed Henry. "I hope &s;o," &s;aid the prelate, "but there is an exception to this general rule of happy indu&s;try, among my pea&s;ants. One of them, and dearer to me than the re&s;t, has never been known to rai&s;e her voice to &s;ongs of vivacity; although her notes of &s;adne&s;s might vie with tho&s;e which grace the woes of &s;orrow's bird. Yet &s;he toils&mdash;I wi&s;h her not to toil&mdash;more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, and with more content than any of the re&s;t: but, alas! &s;he too often waters the plants with her tears, and I know not why." "And a female!" &s;aid Caroline, drawing the back of her hand acro&s;s her own eyes. "And, I fear, an un|happy one," an&s;wered the bi&s;hop. "She came recommended to me by a brother, who is no more. Some my&s;tery, however, involves her. It is about a year and half ago, that &s;he was bequeathed to my care. Her
<PB N="641" REF="651">mind &s;eems to require employment, and I, therefore, have &s;uffered her to bu&s;y her&s;elf among&s;t the flowers. I wi&s;hed it, indeed, to be amu&s;ement; &s;he makes it labour. In all things &s;he has diligence and ta&s;te: yet &s;he has capacities for higher culture: a &s;en&s;e&mdash; a natural &s;en&s;e and &s;en&s;ibility too, of virtue and of religion. I &s;u&s;pect &s;he has lo&s;t a relation, or, perhaps, mourns my brother, who was a prototype of benevolence&mdash;or &s;he laments, perchance, her ab&s;ence from her country. She is continually heaping the flower beds into hillocks, like graves, and then covers them with the flowers new &s;et. But &s;he has now made &s;ome progre&s;s towards clear per|ceptions of life and death, and holine&s;s and truth; yet her melancholy, though &s;oftened, is not di&s;pelled. She has of late been touched by the example of the nuns, and wi&s;hes for a conventual life. She is no way gloomy, or &s;ullen; but I have never been able to trace a &s;mile on her countenance; and, if her grief continues, I have thoughts of indulging her as a novitiate in the con|vent of which my friend St. Seraphina is the
<PB N="642" REF="652">&s;uperior. That is the young woman now bending over the farther bed of ro&s;es, and tying &s;ome of them up." "Alas! &s;he wants &s;upport her&s;elf&mdash;her &s;pirits are &s;unk to the earth," &s;ighed Caroline. "She is not of Europe, you will perceive. But I cannot di&s;cover her my&s;tery," &s;aid the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>While he was giving the&s;e additional traits, and the company advanced nearer the object, a loud and piercing &s;hriek bur&s;t from Arthur's Indian, and another &s;cream from the female labourer, &s;o loud and piercing it rent the air. In the next moment, the names of Flore&s;co and Zoraida were reverberated from the one to the other, with every mark of wild and ungovernable joy. They em|braced&mdash;they pro&s;trated them&s;elves on the earth&mdash;they lifted up their hands towards heaven&mdash;they ki&s;&s;ed the feet of the &s;pec|tators&mdash;kneeled down with humility&mdash; &s;prung up in extacy&mdash;and again embraced.&mdash; It was, indeed, Zoraida, the innocent idol and never-fading image of Flore&s;co's heart.</P>
<P>"My brother," &s;aid the prelate, "re|turning from the we&s;tern plantations, where
<PB N="643" REF="653">he had ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable fortune, had brought over three natives of the country in his &s;uite, two of the&s;e died upon the pa&s;&s;age, with many others of the &s;able race belonging to the captain him&s;elf, an epidemy raging in the ve&s;&s;el from the heat of the weather, and the cruel method of crowding &s;o many human beings together in &s;o narrow a &s;pace. My poor brother him&s;elf lived only a few hours after his arrival; he yielded up his breath even before I could &s;ee him; his corp&s;e, with the re&s;t of his property, and this Indian girl, were conveyed to Coutance, and when I could acquire fortitude to attend to common affairs, I found among&s;t the papers of the decea&s;ed the following note addre&s;&s;ed to my&s;elf:&mdash;'Faithful to me in &s;ervitude, attentive to me in &s;ickne&s;s, even to the ex|piring hour at which I write this, receive among&s;t my be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions the bearer hereof, the orphan Zoraida.'</P>
<P>"I can add little to this account, except that the mo&s;t docile and gentle manners, and a &s;omething of &s;adne&s;s, which her want of our language prevents her yet from explaining,
<PB N="644" REF="654">had given me a &s;incere intere&s;t to &s;ee her more happy." "They will explain them|&s;elves," exclaimed Arthur, "&s;ee they are already telling to each other their &s;hort but faithful hi&s;tory! Gracious Providence! how alike in their fates, their fortunes, and their feelings!&mdash;alike be their felicity! Leave them, I pray you, good my lord, a little to them|&s;elves &mdash;they are of the &s;ame country, the &s;ame village, the &s;ame affection, and I am even more intere&s;ted for them than your&s;elf." "We are all intere&s;ted," interpo&s;ed the re&s;t of the party, "and if Zoraida be as valuable as Flore&s;co," &s;aid the lieutenant to the bi&s;hop, "your brother has bequeathed to you a trea&s;ure indeed." Father Arthur then recited the brief &s;tory of his &s;able <HI>protege&eacute;,</HI> which was &s;o exact a counterpart of the good prelate's adopted, that although the different friends of the abbey and ca&s;tle, were thus drawn for a while out of them&s;elves, and they could hear only a repetition of a well|known tale, the new intere&s;t which the di&s;|covery had created, made them li&s;ten to every circum&s;tance with the eagerne&s;s of affection.</P>
<P><PB N="645" REF="655">Although Arthur had moved with his friends only a few paces, the &s;able lovers ap|peared to have no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any thing but of them&s;elves. In the language of the heart, however, they had been abundant, pouring forth and exchanging that way every image and &s;entiment of bli&s;s and rapture, with an ardour that caught the view not only of the bi&s;hop and his gue&s;ts, but of the pea|&s;ants who had gathered near; at length Flo|re&s;co drew from a pocket-book, with which True George had pre&s;ented him, the work of Jane Atwood's own hands&mdash;not only the remains of his beloved's letter with all its fond repairs, even tho&s;e precious pieces which had been victims to his tenderne&s;s, and had been mended by Denni&s;on, but he pre&s;ented her with an an&s;wer written with his own hand&mdash;the achievement of many a toil&s;ome hour, and interrupted by a thou&s;and occupa|tions, a thou&s;and protracting incidents. Zo|raida received it with joy, and gave to it a re&s;idence neare&s;t to her palpitating heart. The &s;acred piece of &s;hawl, another trea&s;ured memorial, was next produced, and delivered
<PB N="646" REF="656">to her who&s;e bo&s;om it had once warmed and guarded&mdash;on that faithful &s;hrine it now again was placed, and tears of extacy fell fa&s;t upon it. Children of nature! their wonder, and their bli&s;s, were alike un&s;peakable. But who that &s;aw them would have wi&s;hed for, or wanted words to explain that their eloquent and common mother had never given life or love to any of her offspring more true to her emotions?</P>
<P>When utterance was re&s;tored, they conver&s;ed in their own native tongue, and their di&s;|cour&s;e ran thus: "Deare&s;t Zoraida lives for her Flore&s;co."&mdash;"And Flore&s;co for Zorai|da," an&s;wered the enraptured maid; then taking each other by the hand, they ran as if in&s;pired by one idea, to the place where their patrons were grouped, and pro&s;trating them|&s;elves before the bi&s;hop and the monk, cro&s;&s;ed their hands on their bo&s;oms, ki&s;&s;ed the ground near which their benefactors &s;tood, and &s;hewed every &s;ign of gratitude.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop and his friends were extremely moved at this meeting of the lovers, and we tru&s;t that our readers, in good will to poor Flo|re&s;co,
<PB N="647" REF="657">will not deem the time lo&s;t which they have be&s;towed on him and his Zoraida.&mdash; Even Henry and Caroline received from it an increa&s;e of that happine&s;s which &s;till warmed the centre of their hearts from the no le&s;s unexpected recovery of one another&mdash;a hap|pine&s;s which nothing but &s;uch an event could po&s;&s;ibly have augmented.</P>
<P>Father Arthur, who for rea&s;ons formerly &s;tated, believed the partner of his beloved dome&s;tic's heart was no more&mdash;felt even a paternal joy, as at the return of a daughter to his arms. He expre&s;&s;ed this to his mitred friend, of whom, before he left the palace, he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to number Zoraida among&s;t his children. "Be it &s;o," an&s;wered the bi&s;hop,&mdash;"I confide her to your care: were &s;he, indeed, my daughter, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to place her under &s;uch protection&mdash; aware as I am that her virtue now, and her reward hereafter, will &s;uffer nothing by in|ve&s;ting him at the &s;ame time with full powers to di&s;po&s;e of her as he thinks proper. In this too I &s;hall fulfill part of my dear brother's dying reque&s;t, in granting an a&s;ylum to the
<PB N="648" REF="658">orphan Zoraida; for thus &s;hall I provide for her a father, and a hu&s;band. But," con|tinued the bi&s;hop, "another part of my duty to her, and to my brother, &s;till remains. Had it plea&s;ed heaven to allow time for a more regular di&s;tribution of his fortunes, this object of his regard would have had her &s;hare: his benevolence would have com|pleted what his pity began. Look then to me for the arrangement of her worldly good, and you, my venerable Arthur, &s;hall be in|&s;tructed as to my de&s;igns on this head, in which the late happy incident has made no &s;ort of alteration."</P>
<P>While this treaty of loving kindne&s;s was negociating betwixt the bi&s;hop and the monk, on their return into the hou&s;e, Henry and Caroline, Johanna and Charles, were made &s;pectators of a &s;cene not le&s;s intere&s;ting. Partington and the apothecary had informed the a&s;&s;ociates of Zoraida of her happy ren|contre, and its probable con&s;equence, and unwilling that her companions &s;hould be no way the better, or the merrier on the occa|&s;ion, Partington, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, &s;et
<PB N="649" REF="659">them all dancing upon the green; he him|&s;elf opening the ru&s;tic gambols. They had received general orders to pre&s;ent no&s;egays to the bi&s;hop's gue&s;ts on their'leaving the gar|den, and had been gathering the choice&s;t flowers of the &s;ea&s;on for their ma&s;ter's pre&s;ent company. The&s;e the merry-hearted &s;quire di&s;tributed with &s;ome judgment, giving, for in&s;tance, laurels to Henry, and myrtle to Caroline&mdash;and, running with Flore&s;co and Zoraida to another part of the garden, de|manded the aid of True George to &s;tick that &s;till exulting and ardent couple in the mid&s;t of a groupe of &s;un-flowers: at length not making them comprehend the &s;pirit of his amicable abu&s;e, which, however, he was too happy to re&s;train, he fini&s;hed his frolic by gliding money into every palm while he was &s;haking hands, and then with the delighted apothecary, who&s;e heart always reflected the joy of others, returned into the palace: where, indeed, the re&s;t of the party had gone &s;ome time before. John Fitzorton alone re|mained. He had placed him&s;elf, not in &s;ullen &s;olitude to avoid the &s;ight or the &s;ound of the
<PB N="650" REF="660">happy, but where both his eye and ear might be gladdened: yet great and manifold revo|lutions had pa&s;&s;ed his mind: he was &s;ome|times forced upon the thought of the&s;e, even in the gaye&s;t moments of the &s;ocial joy, or &s;oft endearment of tho&s;e he loved: and not to ca&s;t even a pa&s;&s;ing cloud on the&s;e, he would &s;tep a&s;ide without &s;eeming to part company, &s;hade him&s;elf awhile from the too inten&s;e ob&s;ervation of others, and if a &s;igh or a tear from reflection forced their way, it heaved unheard, and fell un&s;een, and generally in the next moment he joined his friends, and all was well. He had &s;elected on this occa|&s;ion his own bouquet, as he &s;aw others gather|ing &mdash;and following an innocent thought, drawn from times long pa&s;t, but fre&s;h in his recol|lection, he made up as nearly as the flowers would allow &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage as had been pre&s;ented to Olivia on the anniver&s;ary of her birth. He pau&s;ed a few minutes to place them as they then were arranged, and as again he &s;lowly moved on he pre&s;&s;ed them on his bo&s;om&mdash;but as he reached the palace door at which Henry and Caroline were &s;tand|ing
<PB N="651" REF="661">with joined hands, he held the flowers in a po&s;ition &s;o as to prevent any notice of their arrangement as he pa&s;&s;ed, and then di&s;po&s;ed of them to his &s;atisfaction&mdash;for they were that night &s;trewed on his pillow.</P>
<P>Yet none of the company had received more heart-felt delight from the meeting of the Indian lovers than John Fitzorton. The evening was pa&s;&s;ed at the palace with the highe&s;t &s;ocial enjoyment: when the gue&s;ts were parted, Zoraida was clo&s;etted with the bi&s;hop, from whom &s;he received permi&s;&s;ion to accompany the protector of her faithful admirer; and the next morning he delivered her, with his own hand, to her new guar|dian &mdash;having previou&s;ly explained all his generous de&s;igns. He then embraced the whole party, and bade them farewell.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LXIII.</HEAD>
<P>WE feel our&s;elves called upon, how|ever, at this cri&s;is, to take a &s;ummary view of the conduct of Caroline Stuart in the late
<PB N="652" REF="662">tran&s;actions at the convent. The votary of eternal retreat had returned to &s;ociety: &s;he had returned almo&s;t from the altar of immor|tal love, to the altar of human pa&s;&s;ion; and it was CAROLINE STUART who had done this. Her ju&s;tification mu&s;t be &s;anctioned by every aweful power; and it behoves us to take care that, by our inadvertence, we do not leave her expo&s;ed to the cen&s;ure either of having lightly &s;ought, or lightly left, her &s;acred a&s;ylum.&mdash;She quitted not human &s;ociety in di&s;gu&s;t, nor with a de&s;ign to bury her&s;elf in the gloomy caverns of inacce&s;&s;ible &s;olitude; forgetful, or affecting to forget, that the world &s;till held objects de&s;erving her love. The paths &s;he had de&s;erted had innumerable flowers, mixed with countle&s;s thorns: all the former &s;he had endeavoured to twine into wreaths for her deare&s;t friends; but, le&s;t one of the latter &s;hould find its way into their bo|&s;oms, &s;he gathered them all in her own&mdash;all that, alas, &s;he could remove&mdash;and fled with them, where they might no more be heard,&mdash; no more be &s;een; yet, even in the bo&s;om of &s;o|litude, &s;tern and eternal, and with many of the
<PB N="653" REF="663">&s;harpe&s;t of the&s;e thorns in her own heart, &s;he taught the cloi&s;ter to bloom. During her noviciate, her regularity, her gentlene&s;s, her wi&s;dom, her talents, had &s;oftened the unne|ce&s;&s;ary rigours of a mona&s;tick in&s;titution.&mdash; Her harp, her lute, her voice, had been the &s;olace of the &s;orrowful, and had elevated the joy of the happy. The nuns, the &s;i&s;ters, the &s;uperiors re&s;orted to her for fortitude, for comfort, for occupation; and though the &s;acred hymn &s;ucceeded to the &s;ong, the har|mony of Caroline lo&s;t nothing by the a&s;cen|&s;ion of her notes from earth to heaven. In fine, &s;he had communicated joy to all around her: a purer piety, a firmer faith, a meeker re&s;ignation reflected from her example; &s;he had made content a re&s;ident of the con|vent, and in bidding farewell to her cloi&s;ter, &s;he had obeyed the &s;ame voice which &s;um|moned her to enter it,&mdash;the voice of faith, of virtue, and of God!</P>
<P>There now remained nothing to be adju&s;ted at Coutance, but the parting vi&s;it of father Arthur to the convents. Caroline &s;eemed to wi&s;h &s;he might be permitted to accompany
<PB N="654" REF="664">him to the Vi&s;itation, but in this, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be over-ruled by the tender and tran&s;ported Henry. The monk, therefore, blended her kinde&s;t wi&s;nes to the abbe&s;s, and to the nuns, with his own, and brought back in return the mo&s;t cordial felicitations to their favourite Caroline, and her whole party. On the evening of the &s;ame day, be|ing informed that a ve&s;&s;el, with good accom|modations, might be hired for England, the happy groupe took their leave of Normandy; and without meeting any thing to interrupt their too-often thwarted enterprizes, they re|gained the coa&s;t of Albion, and proceeded to their family-man&s;ions, where the re&s;t of their friends had fondly been expecting them.</P>
<P>Thus, after all their trials, and, we tru&s;t, as irreproachable conduct under them as mor|tals, in this mixed and imperfect &s;tate, can hope to attain, were Henry Fitzorton and Caroline Stuart brought together. Yet, &s;eve|ral of the events that led to their union were &s;o di&s;a&s;trous, and one in particular, the death of Olivia, &s;o &s;incerely regretted, even by the parties to whom it gave the freedom of
<PB N="655" REF="665">choice, that nothing but &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of great and unexpected ble&s;&s;ings could have produced the felicity which was, at length, e&s;tabli&s;hed, as well in the per&s;ons of Caroline and Henry, as in the mutual friends and rela|tives of both. Time, however, who has been ju&s;tly repre&s;ented by a great writer as having a wallet at his back, in which he puts &s;craps for oblivion, by degrees &s;o&s;tened away the memory of pa&s;t images of di&s;tre&s;s, leaving only impre&s;&s;ions which the mind either con|templates with a melancholy plea&s;ure, or a moral advantage.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pended ideas of happine&s;s to &s;ome, and of re&s;ignation to others, of the families and friends of the abbey and of the ca&s;tle, at length returned. The remaining enemies of both hou&s;es had all been properly di&s;po&s;ed of. The treachery of the elder Otley was &s;everely puni&s;hed, as we have &s;een, by a tremendous death, and by the hands of tho&s;e who cor|rupted him. His corrupters, Valentine Miles, Nicholas Dabble, the younger Otley, with &s;everal of their accomplices, male and female, were, in pur&s;uance of their &s;entence, duly
<PB N="656" REF="666">executed. The reader may remember that John Fitzorton, to appea&s;e the di&s;appointed multitude, predicted that the next gathering together of the &s;ame culprits would probably be at the gallows. The prophecy was at la&s;t fulfilled to very general &s;atisfaction. Of the turnpike-man and his wife the joy was com|plete; and, indeed, &s;everal of the banditti found a certain con&s;olation derived from their mutual hate, even when they were on the &s;caffold, to perceive their de&s;tiny the &s;ame. The ingenious Mr. Skuttle, the landlord of the Hand-in-hand, and &s;everal of his a&s;&s;oci|ates were, for the fir&s;t time of their lives, devoted to the &s;ervice of their country. Ju&s;|tice Barhim flouri&s;hed a &s;hort time longer, and was, at length, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by &s;ome of tho&s;e very rogues of whom he was &s;o tena|cious; but the indignant and ferocious lady Tempe&s;t, rather from rage than &s;hame, effected her own de&s;truction. On the morn|ing of execution, &s;he was found dead in her cell. Re&s;ulting from the&s;e terrible, but ju&s;t puni&s;hments of vice, the property and hap|pine&s;s of virtue were more effectually &s;ecured.
<PB N="657" REF="667">In the hou&s;es, offices, and hiding places, above and under ground, in various parts of the va&s;t metropolis, appertaining to one or other of the delinquents, the indefatigable pro&s;ecutor, his judicial brother, and his learned friend, di&s;covered divers fal&s;e and extorted &s;ecurities and in&s;truments, which, though they had pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal polluted channels, reverted at length to the fir&s;t principal, and came back puri|fied, to their proper &s;ource. Mr. Thomas, one of her lady&s;hip's fir&s;t loves, in proce&s;s of time, amu&s;ed him&s;elf by an evening ride upon the road, and in an attempt to pillage and murder a fellow-traveller, was him&s;elf &s;hot through the head. But to Jeputha, by who&s;e means the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the ban|ditti was made to Partington and his friends, who, as we have ob&s;erved, was of manners le&s;s abandoned, and who had been forced into her criminal employments, and de&s;erted them in terror, his maje&s;ty's pardon was ex|tended.</P>
<P>Partington, who had for &s;ome time &s;u&s;|pended his abu&s;ive habits, in the &s;erious and

Of the former, Mrs. Her|bert had become one of his mo&s;t marked ob|jects: her alacrity in carrying the broad|&s;word and loaded gun to the coach, and her other heroic achievements for the gyp&s;ey expedition, made the fir&s;t forcible impre&s;|&s;ion, for he averred that he did not at all doubt the fair caitiff would cut his old head from his &s;houlders, if he had the honour to be worthy thereof; and &s;ince that, the hi&s;|tory of her attentions to the young Johanna, and what farther he had ob&s;erved of her conduct during the &s;ickne&s;s of Mrs. Fitz|orton, confirmed her conque&s;t; and as &s;he was no le&s;s taken with the &s;quire&mdash;who&s;e mind &s;he could read, even through the di&s;|gui&s;e of his humours and &s;ingularities,&mdash;it was agreed, that on condition the younger varlets con&s;ented to make a general marrying day, the middle-aged Amelia, and old Ba&s;il Parting|ton &s;hould form the fir&s;t couple. In due time this actually did take place, with a
<PB N="659" REF="669">provi&s;o, only, on the part of John, which will pre&s;ently be &s;tated.</P>
<P>True George was at length rewarded with the hand of his lovely Jane, and although the latter, even to the term of a long and re&s;pectable life, &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to pen|&s;ive plea&s;ures, which &s;eemed to &s;pring rather from impre&s;&s;ion of early misfortune, than from con&s;titutional gravity, it no way inter|rupted her being uniformly an endearing wife, and, in the general, a happy woman: both &s;he and her hu&s;band, however, re|&s;olved, on principles of real affection, to remain with Henry and Caroline; neither could any per&s;ua&s;ion prevail with george to a&s;&s;ume the title, although he accepted the office and labours of &s;teward, while the good old Denni&s;on was alive: and it was with no better &s;ucce&s;s that an attempt was made to elevate the latter to a more ab&s;olute inde|pendency: "As a &s;teward he had lived, as a &s;teward, God willing, he would die."</P>
<P>Partington perceiving a longer delay was likely to happen than he now thought nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="660" REF="670">determined to &s;ettle every thing after his own fa&s;hion; "The caitiffs," exclaimed he, "will at this rate wa&s;te their lives in preparing for its e&s;tabli&s;hment." He therefore &s;um|moned every body, above and below &s;tairs, into the large hall of the Bury, but &s;carcely large enough to contain the vi&s;itors, and as &s;oon as they were got together&mdash;"Good," &s;aid he, "and now you &s;hall &s;ee that I will pair ye off, ye &s;hilly-&s;hally vagabonds, as ea&s;ily as I couple my terriers. This ble&s;&s;ed day I have determined, that as I mean my&s;elf to become a &s;lave to this oldi&s;h ra&s;cal, none of ye &s;hall be left at liberty to laugh at me." Here he tucked the arm of Mrs. Herbert, under his own, and &s;allied with her round the room, True George and Jane Atwood, Charles and Johanna, Flore&s;co and Zoraida, Goody Brab&s;on's Sally and William, Jerom and Jonathan, with the apothecary's two fair daughters&mdash;al&s;o, the &s;on of the gyp&s;ey chief, and the pardoned penitent Jeputha, and, not|with&s;tanding a little re&s;i&s;tance on the part of the dam&s;el, and a &s;ly look at True George,
<PB N="661" REF="671">Rachael, and the young Sexton&mdash;"And if any more in&s;ufferables," cried he, "of this our pari&s;h of Partington, or any &s;pin&s;ters and bachelors from the vicinity of the ca&s;tle, or the abbey, who are now our gue&s;ts, wi&s;h to do as we do, this is their opportunity&mdash;but there is no time left to think about it, for to tell you the truth, we are waited for in the church, even while we are now &s;peaking."</P>
<P>In real truth, the &s;quire had waggi&s;hly preconcerted the whole &s;ubject with the rector of his pari&s;h, as to both the day and hour, and had cau&s;ed it to be in&s;inuated, not only about his own pari&s;h, but into tho&s;e above-mentioned, proclaiming, that tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to pay due re&s;pect to Henry Fitzorton and Caroline Stuart,&mdash;of who&s;e rencontre on the continent, and happy union, they were at the &s;ame time apprized,&mdash;would do well to repair to the Bury, where &s;uch as were di&s;po&s;ed to marry, and were found to be right and true vagabonds to one another, would find a wedding dinner, and the charge of the &s;pecial licen&s;es defrayed by their &s;ove|reign
<PB N="662" REF="672">liege &s;coundrel, the &s;aid Partington, This edict brought together not only all the young, but all &s;uch of the old as could endure the labours of the journey; for as it &s;erved not only as an information of the union of Henry with the only lady whom they deemed fit to &s;ucceed Olivia, but gave them an opportunity to pay their, perhaps, la&s;t duty to tho&s;e they mo&s;t loved and ho|noured &mdash;mo&s;t of Olivia's cottagers, and all Caroline's pen&s;ioners embraced an occa&s;ion &s;o gratifying to their hearts; and with re|&s;pect to the younger part, the &s;quire had given out that none but &s;uch as were di&s;|po&s;ed to follow his example in regard to marriage, would be deemed &s;ufficiently qua|lified for the invitation, and it would there|fore be expected of all lovers to bring wedding rings in their pockets, and to put an end to all quarrels about &s;ighs, cruelty, &amp;c. by going fairly and openly to church. It is incredible what numbers a&s;&s;embled; &s;o ma|ny, indeed, that the fea&s;t intended for dinner did not take place until the &s;upper hour.
<PB N="663" REF="673">Partington led the way to the church, and was among&s;t the fir&s;t of tho&s;e who approach|ed the altar, although he remained the la&s;t, pre&s;erving throughout the ceremony a reve|rence of demeanour &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, and wholly different from his u&s;ual beha|viour. On their return from the altar, they were introduced to Henry and Caroline, who received and returned the mo&s;t heart|felt homage, and although at the particular reque&s;t of Caroline, much of that gleeful merriment which Partington had plotted, was given up, an evening of more general, or genuine &s;atisfaction and felicity has &s;eldom been &s;een in this jarring world.</P>
<P>The pen&s;ioners and cottagers were conti|nued on the li&s;t of Henry and Caroline; but as it was intended by that amiable pair, as well as Charles and Johanna, to re&s;ide for &s;ome time abroad, and as the colonel had &s;ignified his intention to return to the field, the care of all the&s;e objects of bounty de|volved upon the good old Denni&s;on, who returned to the abbey; and True George
<PB N="664" REF="674">and Jane Atwood, during the ab&s;ence of the family, were the guardians of the ca&s;tle: little Fitz al&s;o, was to have a &s;oft cu&s;hion in both the&s;e eventful man&s;ions. Father Arthur with Flore&s;co, and Zoraida, whom the good man had united, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chapel-hou&s;e, with a re&s;erve of rooms for them in both the ca&s;tle and abbey, as fancy might direct. And while the&s;e points were &s;ettling, Partington prote&s;ted "that he was &s;o much in the habit of living with his old caitiffs, that if his beloved &s;coundrel of a bride," affectionately care&s;&s;ing her, "was of his way of thinking, &s;he would e'en join the vagabond party, and leave the old Bury to that grey-headed caitiff, Le Maitre, with the u&s;e of the woods and hedges to Blondel Gapper."</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition being agreed to, arrange|ments were made accordingly, and Henry Fitzorton with his Caroline, little John and Carry, Charles and his Johanna, Partington and his Amelia, embarked for the continent, with intent to pa&s;s the re&s;idue of the &s;ummer
<PB N="665" REF="675">at Paris, the winter in the &s;outhern parts of France, and the whole of the following year in Italy.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, re&s;igning with manly grace to di&s;pen&s;ations, the wi&s;dom and benevolence of which he pre&s;umed not to que&s;tion, John &s;ettled mo&s;t of his worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the manner he had all along intended, on his Johanna, and on the children of Olivia, di&s;|po&s;ing of the re&s;t &s;o as to te&s;tify his remem|brance of the worthy in whatever &s;tation of life. He once more girded on his &s;word, from the mingled motives that had already &s;o often urged him to the field. A war with Spain, when &s;ome of our i&s;lands were threat|ened with inva&s;ion, afforded the opportunity; and a braver or more experienced officer could not have been entru&s;ted with the wealth or glory of his country: victorious alike in the &s;enate and the camp. He was promoted to the rank of General, in the direct line of a&s;cent; for none other would John Fitzorton have accepted.</P>
<P>No le&s;s active, nor of le&s;s &s;ervice to his country, the re&s;pectable James had yearly
<PB N="666" REF="676">continued to illu&s;trate the important advan|tages derived both to the individual and to the community, by pre&s;erving the <HI>golden mean.</HI> In one &s;teady tenour of principles, of integrity, and of per&s;everance, he &s;till main|tained the peace and order of his own mind, and of &s;ociety. Happy from di&s;po&s;ition and from events, he had effected this without having &s;uffered any peculiar misfortune of body or of mind, without being impeded in his progre&s;s to fame, fortune, or felicity, by any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which frequently extin|gui&s;h the de&s;ire, and &s;ometimes annihilate the principle, that leads us to be of u&s;e either to our&s;elves or others. He neither encoun|tered nor created one incident that Henry would have called an adventure, or John looked upon as an object of conflict; and yet he wooed, and yet he won. In that part of the human day, which, lying preci&s;ely betwixt its blooming morn and fading eve, may truly be called its noon, James Fitzorton, as if de&s;tined in all things to be the medium, &s;ought and &s;ecured the affections of a very amiable woman,&mdash;the daughter of a brother
<PB N="667" REF="677">judge,&mdash;with whom he lived in a &s;tate of uninterrupted confidence and tranquillity: a &s;tate which we are neverthele&s;s aware, few of our heroic readers will envy, many will think in|&s;ipid, and upon which, every lover of adventure will look down from the &s;ummit of a roman|tic heart with the mo&s;t chivalric &s;corn; yet in &s;pite of all the&s;e grand di&s;dains, the lofty cha|racter of a &s;afeguard of the public, to whom is confided the property and lives of his fel|low-citizens, and the endearing offices of neighbour, friend, and brother, hu&s;band, father, and chri&s;tian, have never been &s;u&s;|tained with more unvarying rectitude; and if the rectitude of his illu&s;trious brothers was pre&s;erved under temptations more numerous and &s;evere; if a keener feeling of joy, from more acute &s;en&s;ation, &s;ometimes attached to the character of Henry, were not the moments of &s;uperior felicity purcha&s;ed by days and nights of agonizing &s;orrow?&mdash;and did it not call for a philo&s;ophy and a life of bo&s;om-con|tention, rigorous as that of John, to keep rea&s;on on her throne? Yet &s;o variou&s;ly are
<PB N="668" REF="678">we formed, that whoever holds his principles uncorrupt, will, probably, like <HI>all</HI> the&s;e brothers, have a more equal &s;hare of happi|ne&s;s, however unequally dealt out, and cer|tainly be all entitled to the veneration and love of their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>At length, Henry and Caroline, with their attendant friends, after having pa&s;&s;ed four years, two more than they intended, from home, arrived at Fitzorton ca&s;tle, where the brothers, John and James, with the bride of the latter, were a&s;&s;embled to receive them, and where they intended to pa&s;s the &s;ummer. The tender &s;en&s;e of times pa&s;t remained; yet, as the General now felt di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days in the bo&s;om of retirement, and as there was no longer a wall of &s;eparation between the abbey and the ca&s;tle, Henry and Caroline re&s;ided at the former, and the Gene|ral and Olivia's children at the latter. The lieutenant &s;till intended to re&s;ume his long|neglected profe&s;&s;ion, but, as his Johanna felt her&s;elf more at home under the protection of her guardian and friends during her hu&s;band's
<PB N="669" REF="679">ab&s;ence, &s;he agreed to pa&s;s part of her time at the abbey, and part at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The return of Henry and Caroline was celebrated with univer&s;al joy; and that &s;hare of merriment which was repre&s;&s;ed at the Bury, on the general wedding day, now bur&s;t forth; the abbey had re&s;umed its former dignity; it was re&s;tored to magnificence, and purified by virtue; the feet which had receded ran towards it; the eye that had &s;urveyed it with abhorrence as the carou&s;al of vice, or with alarm, as the haunt of ob&s;cene &s;pectres, now again gazed upon it as a place redeemed;&mdash;as a &s;anctuary con&s;ecrated anew. Father Ar|thur, his Indian pair, Denni&s;on, and all but little Fitz, who had breathed his la&s;t in a good old age, were found even happier and healthier than they had been left. Old Gaffer and Gammer Atwood were alive, and were on a vi&s;it to their daughter, and her happy hu&s;band, when Henry came home.&mdash; The turnpike-man, hone&s;t Blondel, and all of whom the reader of this hi&s;tory can wi&s;h to hear plea&s;ant tidings, were in health, and
<PB N="670" REF="680">di&s;tributed &s;ome at the ca&s;tle, &s;ome at the abbey, &s;ome at the manor-hou&s;e, and the re&s;t at the Fitzorton arms. The jubilee continued &s;everal days,&mdash;and a great evening, in which all were to a&s;&s;emble previous to &s;eparation, was ap|pointed. This, al&s;o, was to be conducted by Partington, who declared he was happier than he had ever been in his life. The an|cient hall of the abbey was the place of meet|ing &mdash;and although Henry, Caroline, Charles, and Johanna, appeared, only becau&s;e gratitude demanded their pre&s;ence for a moment, they withdrew to &s;cenes of le&s;s noi&s;y joy; they were, indeed, ble&s;t in their fonde&s;t wi&s;hes, but they felt a pious decency that at once cha&s;tened, and attempered their &s;atisfaction, while they remained &s;o near the &s;pots where &s;uch a variety of aweful events had happened to them&s;elves and their connexions: indeed, after the trial of a few months, they medi|tated an exchange of the abbey or manor-hou&s;e, with Partington, for the Bury as a ge|neral re&s;idence, and only came down in future once a year. The General's principal ar|rangements were as follow:&mdash;to indulging
<PB N="671" REF="681">him&s;elf in the &s;ociety of Johanna, and the education of Henry's &s;on and daughter, the fir&s;t of whom was given up to his affectionate care, while young Caroline, who pre&s;ented to him an image of her ever-remembered mo|ther, was con&s;igned to his Johanna. They were both trained to, and confirmed by, the church of England; while the children of Henry and Caroline, &s;hould any be the re&s;ult of their union, were to be cultured in the tenets of their lovely mother, and which the father had thought proper to adopt. The&s;e divi&s;ions of faith in families are, indeed, al|ways, more or le&s;s, to be regretted: but when they proceed from principles, not from pa&s;&s;ions; from &s;teady faith, not from capri|cious change, and produce a life pure and holy, differing only in the modes of that faith, who &s;hall pre&s;ume to boa&s;t of exclu&s;ive rectitude?</P>
<P>The day after the general rejoicings, the happy gue&s;ts departed for their &s;everal places of abode in the very content of their &s;ouls. Mr. and Mrs. Partington, for the pre&s;ent, returned to the Bury; Gaffer and Gammer
<PB N="672" REF="682">Atwood to their untroubled cottage; Jerom and Jonathan, with their brides, to farms on the &s;quire's e&s;tate: who continued to appro|priate all the Atwoods except Jane, and &s;he,&mdash;&s;o &s;trange are the revolutions of life,&mdash; became, at length, a re&s;ident with Henry and Caroline,&mdash;a no le&s;s &s;ingular event,&mdash;at Gui&s;e abbey. The lieutenant and Johanna pa&s;t a month with the General, who de&s;ired to &s;ettle &s;ome matters for their future good&mdash;and True George had &s;o much to engage him for &s;ome time at both hou&s;es, that he was alter|nately an inmate of one and the other.</P>
<P>For a &s;hort time, therefore, Henry and Caroline, Jane and Denni&s;on, were left to them&s;elves; and happy as they were in each other, and in the love and friend&s;hip of all who &s;urrounded them&mdash;they did not feel it in|con&s;i&s;tent with that happine&s;s to pa&s;s much of the day that &s;ucceeded their grand fe&s;tival,&mdash; the fir&s;t of their tranquillity,&mdash;not with the living but the dead. The church of Fitz|orton, and the chapel-hou&s;e of the abbey, had a &s;acred claim on the affections of all: but when Henry left his companions for
<PB N="673" REF="683">a while in the latter, and entered the former alone, he was at once plea&s;ed and moved to &s;ee John already bending over the urn of Olivia. The brothers did homage at the tomb of virtue, and were &s;oon joined by the votaries from the chapel: and as they ro&s;e from their devotions it was to embrace each other&mdash;"My Caroline," &s;aid Henry, as they were returning home, "wherefore &s;hould we again quit the&s;e &s;cenes?&mdash;have not the&s;e pen&s;ive &s;weets every part of our felicity? we are here, methinks, under the immediate mini&s;try, and protection of kindred cheru|bim! Let us believe that we are in their charge, and they our guardians." "Ah! be the re&s;t of our lives pa&s;t under their heavenly guidance," &s;aid Caroline!&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;|ed thought," cried Jane. "Do, dear your honours, let us live and die here," exclaimed Denni&s;on, "even where our friends were made angels."</P>
<P>The idea of departed friends changed into guardian &s;pirits, was innocently adopted; the very air and earth were con&s;ecrated; from that moment new &s;ources of happine&s;s opened.
<PB N="674" REF="684">Thus the ca&s;tle, and the abbey became holy ground; nor did they ever leave it more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LXIV.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who have fairly peru&s;ed this hi&s;tory, will, we tru&s;t, have progre&s;&s;ively traced its de&s;ign; yet, it may not be ami&s;s to add, in this clo&s;ing chapter, a recapitu|lation of its moral. In point of intere&s;t with the heart, and effect upon the conduct of the reader, it has been our endeavour to render con&s;picuous, and impre&s;&s;ive, &s;everal of the mo&s;t important objects in literature, in mo|rality, and in dome&s;tic life; with examples and warnings appropriate to each.</P>
<P>In one of the per&s;onages, the character of a prote&s;tant clergyman, and father of a family, of an honourable mind, &s;haded by human errour, and &s;omewhat warped by reli|gious tenacity, has been contra&s;ted with the character and conduct of a man, who is exhi|bited in the perpetration, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, per|&s;everance, puni&s;hment, and repentance, of
<PB N="675" REF="685">progre&s;&s;ive crimes. And as the life and death of the former of the&s;e per&s;ons give the example of a good man, in the &s;everal moral divi&s;ions of a divine, friend, neigh|bour, citizen, parent, and hu&s;band, through every period of a wi&s;e and active life, even till he quits the world, with the above exception; &s;o does the behaviour of the other, hold out the warning of a vicious being, placed in no le&s;s pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, even till he is overwhelmed by a &s;en&s;e of his own enor|mity; bringing the death-bed of the wicked clo&s;e under the eye, in contra&s;t to the death|bed of the righteous.</P>
<P>In a third character, has been pourtrayed a venerable &s;upporter of virtue, in a catholic clergyman, in all the trying in&s;tances of a difficult &s;tation, to act as a corrective on that intolerant of &s;entiment, which influenced the opinions of the prote&s;tant divine.</P>
<P>A fourth endeavour has been to di&s;play, in the dome&s;tic hi&s;tory of three young men, brothers, the two great extremes of philo&s;ophic energy, and poetic &s;oftne&s;s of character, with the &s;afety of the middle man
<PB N="676" REF="686">between both, &s;hewing, however, in the conduct of the two former, the po&s;&s;ibility of pre&s;erving all the virtues of the latter, even when the practice of tho&s;e virtues are ex|po&s;ed by habit, temper, and pur&s;uit, to more arduous trials.</P>
<P>The power of filial piety has al&s;o been given, in the delineation of a mind that pre&s;erved its mode&s;t dignity, amid&s;t the harde&s;t ordeals, to which a child can ever be called upon, in her relative &s;ituation, to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth portrait is that of a candid, and perfectly un&s;u&s;picious character, in all the relations of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh di&s;covers the good produced to an unfortunate woman from &s;ome merciful treatment, received from the fortunate of her own &s;ex: for the want of which many a vio|lated form, but un&s;ullied mind, langui&s;hes in the &s;hades of ob&s;curity, or crouds our &s;treets with irreclaimable victims.</P>

<PB N="679" REF="689">though the hand is pre&s;ented to beauty, ele|gance, and virtue: &s;ince nothing can be more certain, than that more mi&s;chief may re&s;ult from one unhappy marriage, than from an army of men intent on de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Such are &s;ome of the great aims propo&s;ed to be accompli&s;hed by this work as a whole; from a due contemplation of which, with the parts, mu&s;t be collected its energy and colour, its ornament and utility. From the intention, we can with confidence claim &s;ome prai&s;e, for it has been &s;incere;&mdash;from the execution we can derive nothing but hope. The labour has not been light, nor yet unattended by con&s;olation; but if <HI>half a long life</HI> could bring the great moral and do|me&s;tic truths to the point de&s;ired, we &s;hould exult in the means by which the ends were attained.</P>
