<HEAD>THE RESOLUTION RESOLVED UPON.</HEAD>
<P>VIVACITY is contagious.</P>
<P>"You are certainly right (&s;aid I), Amelia. I once more feel that I have looked at my object in the wronge&s;t point of view. It de&s;erves a fairer &s;ituation; and I am now re&s;olved to place it in a lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral

light. The health which you have prayed for, I anticipate joyfully, and with it I expect the ro&s;y cheek, the &s;parkling eye, and that chearful alacrity, which runs unfatigued through the amu&s;ements or bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. In your eulogy on the capital of France, I forget the phlegm of a &s;tudious, gloomy, Engli&s;hman, and drive in the airy chariot of fancy, over the rugged pavement of a crouded city, plea&s;ed at the &s;ight of &s;o many thou&s;and new faces, and not at all di&s;gu&s;ted either with the rattle of fa&s;hion, or the tumult of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="15">See, my dear Amelia! &s;ee, in the&s;e &s;udden alterations, the true nature of the heart!"</P>
<P>There pa&s;&s;ed over my cheek, at this in&s;tant, one of tho&s;e tran&s;ient burnings, which makes nature blu&s;h for &s;hame at her own incon&s;i&s;tency: but I would not give a &s;ixpence for an author who produces not &s;ome|thing for the heart, even in a com|ment upon its weakne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"P&s;haw (&s;aid I) what a misfor|tune is it to be hypochondriacal: or rather what an hypochondriac is man, take him even at the &s;ounde&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="16">
period of his health. Set but his pa&s;&s;ions afloat; give but the loo&s;e rein to his de&s;ires, or let him but walk in the way of his &s;y&s;tem, and the varying wind, the arrant moon, and the &s;hifting cloud, are all &s;ta|bilities in the compari&s;on: how peevi&s;h, how playful, how irre&s;o|lute, how re&s;olved; without rea&s;on di&s;gu&s;ted, and with as little cau&s;e put again into humour."</P>
<P>"And can all the&s;e changes (ex|claims the calm &s;tander-by); can all the&s;e changes take place in travelling &s;omewhat &s;lower than a foot-pace, only from London to Dover?"</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="17">Ah, cen&s;urer, have a care! Be|ware lea&s;t the accu&s;ation be brought home to your&s;elf. How would the &s;tory run, if thou wert here, with faithful Biography, to &s;et down the particulars of thy own day? De|pend on it the journal of thy heart, in its journey through every &s;ix hours of life, is too full of Quixoti&s;m, phanta&s;m and vagary; and too well &s;tored either with light or &s;erious innovations, to a&s;&s;ert a &s;uperior claim to con&s;tancy: and, even &s;hould there be the meane&s;t &s;on of merchandi&s;e, that ever traded hard for the turn of the penny, on thy own &s;ide of the &s;cale, &s;till I in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="18">
upon it thou can&s;t not have any right to ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone.</P>
<P>The thread of this remon&s;trance is cut &s;hort by almo&s;t a page, in order to bring forward a circum|&s;tance which it is con&s;onant to the &s;y&s;tem of the&s;e travels, in this very place and in no other, to admit.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was beginning to wonder how I could find &s;o many argu|ments pro and con, in regard to this journey to France, and be&s;tow|ing a &s;mile upon the heart, which, &s;ince it beat in the Hotel at Dover, had &s;hifted from one point to another, much often than the
<PB N="7" REF="19">
&s;treamer, which, at the head of the ma&s;t was &s;till inclined the &s;ame way, a &s;pecimen of France, in the &s;hape of a nimble-footed arti&s;t for the modern human face, entered my room, with three &s;kips of courte&s;y, and (being pre-invited) proceeded to give my chin the &s;mirkne&s;s of the pre&s;ent ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The mechanical drudgery of &s;having, however, was by no means his bu&s;ine&s;s, and I &s;oon found the taking off my beard was purely an urbanity, which, being the fir&s;t I ever received from a French hair|dre&s;&s;er, and done with due regard
<PB N="8" REF="20">
to <HI>the graces,</HI> I, the more readily, entered into conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"You have been in France (&s;aid I), young man?"</P>
<P>"I am there at this <HI>in&s;tant</HI> Mon&s;ieur;" replied he.</P>
<P>"The duce you are! (&s;aid I). How long is it, then, &s;ince Dover was added to the dominions of Louis? Perhaps you will be plea&s;ed to al|low too, that I am your pri&s;oner at this in&s;tant!"</P>
<P><HI>"Sans doute,</HI> Mon&s;ieur, while under my hands: but that hits not off;
<PB N="9" REF="21">
my meaning the be&s;t part of me&mdash; <HI>my heart</HI> is certainly at this ble&s;&s;ed moment in Paris."</P>
<P>"In what <HI>part</HI> of it, prithee, is this trea&s;ure depo&s;ited?"</P>
<P>"Ah <HI>mon Dieu</HI> (&s;aid the lad), what a que&s;tion? It beats Mon&s;ieur, up five pair of &s;tairs in the Faux|bourgs St. Marceau, in the beautiful bo&s;om of <HI>Felicity.</HI> A very lofty lodging, perhaps, you may think; but I like it the better for that. It is thereby &s;o much the nearer to the Heavens, to which <HI>Felicity</HI> belongs."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="22">Another &s;uch an enigma as this, would have occa&s;ioned an emotion which might untie the knot of it to &s;ome purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially as the Frenchman was now beginning to flouri&s;h his razor under my throat.</P>
<P><HI>"Felicity!</HI> (&s;aid I, putting back his hand, as if to ward off the razor till my curio&s;ity was &s;atis|fied); I am afraid, friend, you are addicted to that contemptible &s;pe|cies of wit, which in England, we call the Conundrum."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="23">"What I tell you, Mon&s;ieur, is &s;imply and &s;olemnly true: my heart is in the bo&s;om of <HI>my Felicity,</HI> who, in the very quarter I told you, occupies one little cabinet which is to me more decent than the palace of Ver&s;ailles; and as to <HI>wit,</HI> in good faith Mon&s;ieur, the &s;tory of Felicity is too tender and too &s;ad to permit any thing like it."</P>
<P>Though the &s;y&s;tem of &s;ome tra|vellers might, at &s;uch a time as this, lead them into the bedcham|ber, to make the mo&s;t of the two or three hours which remained,
<PB N="12" REF="24">
before the &s;ailing of the packet-boat, yet was it agreeably to <HI>my</HI> &s;y&s;tem, to li&s;ten attentively to the &s;tory of the French Barber's <HI>un|happy Felicity!</HI> To &s;ay the truth, there was every thing in the air and manner of this paradox, to keep awake the curio&s;ity both of Amelia and my&s;elf; &s;o I de&s;ired the &s;upper, which had been ordered, might be kept back a little, that we might have him and his Felicity all to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>"If you will draw your comb lei&s;urely through my hair, young man (&s;aid I), and if there is not, in the relation, &s;omething too
<PB N="13" REF="25">
painful to be repeated, I could wi&s;h to know&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ah Mon&s;ieur (replied the lad interrupting me, and pointing his razor to his own throat, having now done with mine); the pain which <HI>this</HI> could give, by &s;ending me of a &s;udden, into the grave of my fathers (who were all entitled to wear a ribbon in their button-holes, of no mean or undi&s;tingui&s;hed order) would be a mere bagatelle to the very <HI>thought</HI> of relating my &s;ufferings! Upon that intolerable &s;ubject therefore <HI>vous aurez l&aacute; bont&egrave; de me pardonner."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="26">Though my <HI>curio&s;ity</HI> was more heightened, my <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> got the better of it, and I only a&s;ked the <HI>name</HI> of this unfortunate.</P>
<P>He bowed very re&s;pectfully, and repeated his la&s;t &s;entence.</P>
<P>This was as much as any man could decently bear, and I think Amelia exerted the utmo&s;t fortitude of female philo&s;ophy, that &s;he contented her&s;elf with a &s;hort ejacu|lation!</P>
<P>"My good and great God!" &s;aid the.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="27">The Frenchman was, by this time, putting into order the left &s;ide lock, and I felt the comb, as he brought it backwards and forwards, tremble under his hand. In the bended attitude in which he &s;tood to dre&s;s me, my eye was, of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, confined to the top part of his wai&s;tcoat, which being thrown open, I di&s;covered, through the aperture of his &s;hirt-bo&s;om, the cro&s;s of a catholic, and a &s;mall oval <HI>&s;ome|thing,</HI> hanging together.</P>
<P>This &s;omething could certainly be made nothing of, while, as was now the ca&s;e, it remained on
<PB N="16" REF="28">
the wrong &s;ide. My heart was again at the end of my fingers, and I would have given the univer&s;e to untwi&s;t it. Luckily for Amelia it was out of her &s;ight, and &s;o from pure regard to her quiet, I kept the torment all to my&s;elf: twice I made advances towards the in&s;erted oval, and twice I drew back my hand at the check of &s;ighs which were heaved from the heart of a Frenchman. Had the gate of Paradi&s;e been clo&s;ed full in my face, it could not have thrown me into greater perplexity!
<Q><L>"Trifles light as air</L>
<L>Are, to the <HI>curious,</HI> confirmations &s;trong</L>
<L>As proofs of holy writ."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="29">"You are very young?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t old enough to be acquainted with mi&s;ery: (cried the barber); for, till three weeks ago, I danced through every &s;treet of Paris, and was at once the merrie&s;t and the happie&s;t man in the city&mdash;Yes, be my witne&s;s, <HI>mon bon Dieu,</HI> I was the happie&s;t of men!"</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be the poor fellow's heart for dictating this a&s;&s;everation! for, in making it, he pre&s;&s;ed his hand, with the warme&s;t veneration, upon the cro&s;s, and turned the oval.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="30">It proved to be a little varni&s;hed piece of ro&s;e-coloured compo&s;ition, &s;tudded with &s;parkling &s;tones, with the miniature of a female, having the be&s;t-natured &s;et of features in the world, in the centre of it.</P>
<P>At this critical moment, guided by my ill &s;tars, which were re&s;olved to teaze me, the youth left my &s;ide locks, and withdrew to tho&s;e which were behind. With what ineffable fervor did I then wi&s;h that every villainous hair which had contri|buted to my di&s;appointment, might in&s;tantly fall from the head, upon
<PB N="19" REF="31">
which they were unworthy to hang.</P>
<P>Be the reader ever &s;o angry, I cannot, in ju&s;tice to <HI>the heart,</HI> which is fully concerned in every <HI>&s;yllable</HI> of this &s;tory, get on with it fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>When circum&s;tances which en|gage the heart, are playing at cro&s;s-purpo&s;es with it, and every faculty of the brain is on the &s;tretch for accommodation of our wi&s;hes, how often <HI>that</HI> accommo|dation is brought about to the hearth's ab&s;olute content, by &s;ome &s;light manoeuvre, of all others the lea&s;t expected!</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="32">"A mighty pretty picture that Mon&s;ieur!" &s;aid Amelia. I turned &s;hort about with inconceivable quick|ne&s;s, as if the expedient was hit off by a miracle.</P>
<P>Surely the very Devil him&s;elf delayed me in this bu&s;ine&s;s. I had &s;carce turned about, before the Frenchman turned him&s;elf round al&s;o, and was &s;tanding with his back towards me, while he held down his head.</P>
<P>"Was ever man &s;o tormented?" &s;aid I."</P>
<P>"Gracious Heaven!" &s;aid Amelia.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="33"><HI>"Oh Ciell"</HI> (exclaimed the French|man. He &s;till kept his attitude: but, &s;oon recovering him&s;elf, he again begged my pardon, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing Amelia with a he&s;itating voice&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes, Madam, this picture&mdash; this picture &mdash; this &mdash; this &mdash; this &mdash; pic&mdash;pic&mdash;pict&mdash;ure (here his heart de&s;troyed his language), this pic&mdash; ture&mdash;I &s;ay, is the picture of my <HI>unfortunate Felicity!"</HI></P>
<P>"A <HI>woman,</HI> after all!" cried Ame|lia, &s;triking her hands together!</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="34">"And <HI>in di&s;tre&s;s!"</HI> &s;aid I, looking at the lad.</P>
<P>"Even &s;o, (&s;aid the Frenchman, <HI>pre&s;&s;ing</HI> the cro&s;s and <HI>ki&s;&s;ing</HI> the picture); even &s;o".</P>
<P>Where the heart is affected by &s;orrows of a &s;oft and &s;ocial kind, it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to be long &s;ilent. Such &s;orrows bur&s;t of their own accord into language, and are always &s;oothed by being tru&s;ted to the &s;ympathy of tho&s;e about us.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="35">The Frenchman was now touch|ed &s;o thoroughly, that, as he pro|ceeded to fini&s;h my hair, he hummed a &s;ort of &s;onnet under pretence of &s;hewing us that all was well again; by which piece of fine&s;&s;e, his anxiety became, in reality, too big to be contained, and the &s;tory ran thus:</P>
<P>"Certainly, Mon&s;ieur, this is the picture of my Felicity, and I am bani&s;hed from the pre&s;ence of the dear creature, by a couple of accidents which, as I hope to be &s;aved, could not be helped. Felicity, you mu&s;t know, is cur&s;ed with a
<PB N="24" REF="36">
cruel father who drudges all day in his garret for gold, and &s;o is an enemy to every thing but money. I was, for &s;ome time, his apprentice; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee his fair daughter pa&s;s backwards and for|wards by our work-&s;hop, without de&s;pi&s;ing gold, and admiring her beauty. Our hearts were ju&s;t of the &s;ame &s;ort, as they were of the &s;ame age; and we both lo&s;t all our French &s;pirits, and grew as melancholy as your Engli&s;h people &mdash;you will pardon me Mon&s;ieur&mdash; about the &s;ame time. I had wit enough to know, that &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a change in us, could be wrought by nothing but love. We were
<PB N="25" REF="37">
both convinced of this, when we were mightily delighted by &s;tealing a look, or a touch, or a &s;oft ki&s;s, while the old gold-beater's back was turned: but the bare truth of our mutual pa&s;&s;ion was, alas! put out of all doubt, when my ma&s;ter &s;uffered us to pa&s;s a fine day at Marly; that is, if we were inclined <HI>to treat o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>The idea was &s;o charming, that I &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l never, no, never &s;hall I forget it. I had &s;aved up money to the amount of near thirty livres, and &s;o I thought I was laying it out to the heart's be&s;t advantage, by hiring a hand&s;ome cabriolet
<PB N="26" REF="38">
for the whole day. I put my hair into order, hung on my &s;word, and walked forth with Felicity early in the morning, under pretence of having time to amu&s;e her. Cer|tainly, we could have gone by a cheaper conveyance, but then there would, I fore&s;aw, be inconveniences, equal to the cheapne&s;s. A common &s;tage is often crouded with di&s;a|greeable pa&s;&s;engers, and, as Felicity is a fair creature, I thought it be&s;t to enjoy her company alone. Better had it been, however, if the ca|briolet had been at Paris, and I in my ma&s;ter's &s;hop; for, as I told you before, a couple of accidents hap|pened,
<PB N="27" REF="39">
which, though they could not be avoided, turned out very fatally.</P>
<P>In the gardens of our beloved monarch at Marly, every body knows, there are lovers walks with|out number: the trees are &s;o green, the &s;treams are &s;o clear, and there are &s;o many fair figures of both &s;exes, in &s;o many po&s;tures in dif|ferent places, tempting us in marble, (which &s;carce &s;eem to want breath) that it is very wrong for two young French people, that love one ano|ther, to tru&s;t them&s;elves among&s;t them. We got &s;afe out of them, at the co&s;t only of about a thou&s;and
<PB N="28" REF="40">
&s;ighs, and one or two tears of confe&s;&s;ion, which &s;tole down the crim&s;oned cheek of Felicity, till I ki&s;&s;ed it off. Neither was that ki&s;s well timed; for it carried the crim|&s;on, which was before confined to the face, quite down to the neck, till its flu&s;hing de&s;cended even to the bo&s;om. Oh what a &s;ummer-night's &s;un &s;hone upon our pro&s;pect, as we were returning. We had no interrupting dome&s;tic behind our carriage. The hor&s;es were ex|tremely gentle, and I drove them my&s;elf. Ah! that a coachman had been &s;eated before us! What mi&s;ery might have been prevented!</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="41">As fortune, however, would have it, I was, by &s;ome means, in|duced to take a &s;udden turn through a delightful lane (though I confe&s;s it was not upon the road to Paris), and, while I left the hor&s;es to graze upon the herbage that fertilized the banks, Felicity and I got down, with no other view in the world, than to pick out a bouquet of field-flowers, which grew among&s;t the corn. Ah fatal excur&s;ion! Let no two people, who have hearts, indulge them&s;elves in picking flowers out of a corn-field! 'How <HI>fruitful</HI> is this charming &s;oil!' &s;aid I, &s;ighing.</P>

<P>'Good God (&s;aid Felicity), if this high corn is not enough to throw one down.'</P>

<P>I put it into the box of my cabriolet and &s;et forwards. How little did I &s;upect that either this accident, or any other that might precede it, was overlooked! But alas! our very rout was watched, and we were doged to the door of the gold-beater, who was informed of a circum&s;tance which put his daughter under lock and key, and

The lattice of the clo&s;et opened upon the lead-work of a neighbouring-hou&s;e.

<P>THE poor barber had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed a &s;tory, which di&s;covered &s;o much of his own heart, and that of his country, than our ears were &s;aluted with the full bold tones of a voice, i&s;&s;uing from the adjoining room, to the tune of, <HI>O the roa&s;t Beef of Old England;</HI> and, when that voice had done, up &s;prung another in a &s;harper and &s;hriller key, &s;inging forth, in a &s;ort of exta&s;y, <HI>The &s;upreme Plea&s;ures of Paris.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="39" REF="51">Here he bowed, re&s;pectfully, fir&s;t to Amelia, then to me; and, after once more a&s;&s;uring me, that he thanked me for my promi&s;e to keep his &s;ecret, and that if I ever walked into the Fauxbourgs St. Marceau, and would direct my eyes upwards, they might &s;tand the chance of being hand&s;omely rewarded.

<P>Upon the whole, my temper was now thoroughly &s;weetened. The picture of the human heart, in various attitudes and po&s;itions, had been exhibited before me.

I beheld, al&s;o, the uniform operations of pain and plea&s;ure, upon every &s;on and daughter of Adam, in every dif|ferent country. The hi&s;tory of the unfortunate Felicity convinced me, &s;till more fully, of this cardinal truth, namely, that, although cu&s;|toms may throw a different colour|ing over the character of nations, there is one &s;ilent language, uni|ver&s;ally under&s;tood, and univer&s;ally the &s;ame&mdash;the language of pa&s;&s;ion, and of the affections.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="54">In &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e I pa&s;&s;ed another half-hour; and I venerate the memory of the poor barber for having led me into the train of them.

No longer did I imagine it wrong to pa&s;s the boundaries of my own country, to vi&s;it my neighbours on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Amelia adopted the &s;ame &s;entiment upon the &s;ame principles.

He was dre&s;&s;ed in all that decent and undecorated &s;implicity upon which Engli&s;hmen particularly pique them&s;elves.

he admini&s;tered to him, but with|out &s;peaking, in his &s;ickne&s;s: he applied the hart&s;horn, &s;ummoned the coxcomb's &s;ervants, and held their conceited ma&s;ter by the arm, when he was plea&s;ed to be in a fit.

<P>In &s;hort, I had &s;een enough to convince me that, he who hath one &s;ingle particle of prejudice, lurking in any one corner of his heart, or who judges of the whole, from a part, &s;hould be contented to &s;it in the &s;moke of his own chimney corner, and never look farther into the world, than he can &s;ee from his window.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="68">Yet it is travel only which can make us citizens of the world: and it is impo&s;&s;ible for any thing upon the face of the globe (but a fool of quality) who hath gone far into different nations, to put his tru&s;t, either in the colour of a coat, the turn of an ancle, or the &s;hrug of a &s;houlder.

<P><PB N="57" REF="69">Dre&s;s and &s;ize of body, may however, &s;ometimes lead to a &s;mall pa&s;&s;age that looks into the heart which is beating beneath them; but one unguarded action, and one &s;entence, apparently too little to &s;hew much, is worth a thou&s;and &s;uch external &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>In the centre of the cabin, lolled, in &s;eparate chairs, but with hands generally united, two young Eng|li&s;hmen, who&s;e travelling hats cockaded it in the face of midnight; and who, pouring out bumpers of a cordial (which they brought with them) into very &s;izeable gla&s;&s;es,
<PB N="58" REF="70">
threw an arch eye at the moon whom they &s;aw through a hatch-way that opened on the deck, and drank her health: after which, in the &s;ame &s;train of facetiou&s;ne&s;s, they de&s;ired, that &s;he would have the civility to betake her&s;elf to bed, and that &s;he would pre&s;ent their compliments to her ma&s;ter the &s;un, telling him that they &s;hould think his wor&s;hip a very impudent &s;coun|drel, and very ill-mannered, &s;eeing that he &s;lept that night &s;o near Paris, if he did not immediately put on his breeches.</P>
<P>At this &s;ally of wit the different pa&s;&s;engers were differently affected.

<P>The gentleman, whom I pro|nounced to be an Engli&s;hman, forced a courteous &s;imper into his face, in order to &s;often the &s;en&s;e of our hero's mi&s;ery; and, with the &s;ame activity by which he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted Amelia, went upon the deck, and &s;hut the coxcomb's &s;uperdamnable &s;kylight.</P>
<P>The German, with the Iri&s;h legs, was dropping into an agreeable

<P>And yet I appeal to the reader if this &s;ingle action of our young je&s;ters', and the different air with which it was received by the com|pany, doth not afford, a more cer|tain clue to the <HI>heart,</HI> than any

judgment that could po&s;&s;ibly be formed, from a paltry &s;peculation upon legs and &s;houlders, coats and wai&s;tcoats, the clock of a &s;tocking, or the buckling of a &s;hoe.

<P>The&s;e mi&s;takes, however, ori|ginate from our dramatic writers, who deceive us in drawing their characters. The Frenchman of the Engli&s;h theatre, and the Engli&s;h|man upon the &s;tage of Paris, are perfect caracaturas. It is the &s;ame

<P>Before I &s;et out for France, I collected mo&s;t of the volumes which have been written upon it; and I was &s;o perfectly convinced that, as far as the matter of cu&s;toms and country went, the &s;ubject was wholly pre-occupied, and that all remarks, in a &s;imilar track, would be repetition, that I was fully re|&s;olved to turn my ob&s;ervations into

<P>It is a conception equally fal&s;e we entertain, of the nece&s;&s;ity an Engli&s;hman of ta&s;te is under, to equip him&s;elf, on his arrival at Paris, with cloaths of a mere fanta&s;tical cut and colour, a la Francoi&s;e, the plain truth being neither more nor le&s;s than this, that there never was any place where all &s;orts of people

enjoyed, in the greate&s;t degrees, all &s;orts of liberties in dre&s;s, and that, if a per&s;on would wi&s;h to adopt the very pink of the pre&s;ent ta&s;te at Paris, he would array him&s;elf in the dre&s;s he brings with him, as Engli&s;h fa&s;hions are, at this period, followed, both by men and women, almo&s;t to as great an exce&s;s of af|fectation, as French fa&s;hions at London: &s;o that neither country can &s;ay one is more ridiculous than the other in that re&s;pect.</P>

<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE two young jokers hap|pened to go to the &s;ame hotel that I did. The coxcomb in the wrap|ping cloaths, was carried gently off in a chair to Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein's, and the <HI>real</HI> French gentleman bowed politely to the whole com|pany, and walked away to a private hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Without choo&s;ing to enter into any more jokes at pre&s;ent, I with|drew to my chamber; and, what perhaps your chimney-corner cha|racters
<PB N="76" REF="88">
will not give credit to, &s;lept as &s;oundly, as &s;oftly, and as much to my heart's content, in the bed and in the land of an enemy, as if my apartment was under the protection of my natural &s;overeign. The &s;un too, beamed benignity and brightne&s;s into my chamber, in the morning, as if to welcome me, and tempt me to pur&s;ue my journey without further interruptions.</P>
<P>I accepted his radiant invitation and aro&s;e. Amelia breakfa&s;ted with me and the jokers, for whom I am indebted for &s;ome admirable hints, touching the origin of what is
<PB N="77" REF="89">
called the impo&s;ition of French inn|keepers.</P>
<P>It is common enough for travellers, on the &s;ame road, to communicate their bu&s;ine&s;s the one to the other. But the twin je&s;ters were remark|ably re&s;erved upon this &s;ubject, owing, very probably, to the <HI>im|po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;peaking about it; for where men have really the true no-meaning in &s;etting out for a long journey, it is truly difficult to di&s;|clo&s;e their motives. The mo&s;t unde&s;igning nothingne&s;s brought our youths from London to Calais, and the &s;ame unde&s;igning nothing|ne&s;s will, I doubt not, carry them
<PB N="78" REF="90">
back again. After looking at them, however, very intently almo&s;t half an hour, and turning their hearts on all &s;ides, I di&s;covered that, if they had any ray of plot in this excur&s;ion, it was that which might lead foreigners to think very de&s;picably of Engli&s;h prudence, and to do their native country, and all future travellers an injury, by acting like madmen at every &s;tage.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P>One of them took a glittering pur&s;e from his <HI>wai&s;tcoat,</HI> pocket and, with too uncompre&s;&s;ed and liberal a hand, &s;hook it at the ear of his
<PB N="79" REF="91">
companion as much as to &s;ay, "Here it is my friend, here it is: the golden key which &s;hall unlock all the curio&s;ities, toys, and cabinets of France. This will we dedicate my lad to plea&s;ure, politene&s;s, and Paris!"</P>
<P>Here Amelia was obliged to hem and gingle her coffee-cup to pre|vent the ri&s;ings of a virtuous in|dignation.</P>
<P>The youth who was in all the glory of his triumph, ob&s;erved, by this time, &s;ome poor aged creatures of both &s;exes, who pick their &s;canty livelihood from the bounty
<PB N="80" REF="92">
of travellers, curt&s;ying and bow|ing, with petitioning eyes and bending heads, at the windows of the hotel.</P>
<P>The opportunity of joking never e&s;capes the man who&s;e heart lieth in wait for it; and he hath the art of extracting a joke very often from a tale of mi&s;ery, or an incident that would afflict the tender fools of nature with the agonies of grief. The je&s;ter, with the pur&s;e, ran to the window, near which was a large table upon which he &s;pread out, in tempting array, &s;everal guineas, to the tune, perhaps, of about two hundred. The hearts
<PB N="81" REF="93">
of every mendicant flew up in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly into his face. A &s;oft &s;uffu&s;ion of blood coloured, for a moment, the countenance of age; hope &s;parkled in the eye of De&s;pair, and every hand &s;hook even to pal&s;y with expectation.</P>
<P>I was fool enough to imagine that all this preparation indicated a generous action; and Amelia was &s;o perfectly per&s;uaded of it that &s;he &s;et down her cup, and opened the window, that even &s;o tran&s;parent an ob&s;tacle as a few panes of gla&s;s, might not lie in the way of the young gentleman's libe|rality.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="94">Alas! this was nothing more than the ceremony which preceded a joke. Our hero &s;et the table at <HI>two</HI> yards di&s;tance, and de&s;ired them to take what they fairly could by &s;tretching forth their arms from the window.</P>
<P>The poor creatures &s;hook their heads at the impo&s;&s;ibility of the thing. A little boy, half naked, de|clared that he would &s;tand on his head and tumble a whole hour for a &s;ingle &s;ous.</P>
<P>The je&s;ter wittily &s;aid, that he would give him neither a <HI>&s;ow</HI> nor
<PB N="83" REF="95">
a <HI>pig,</HI> unle&s;s he could reach it. Finding no one attempted this, he put the money again into the pur&s;e, and walked with it to the window.</P>
<P>"Now (&s;aid Amelia) I hope you will pay the hone&s;t people for the anxiety you have given them."</P>
<P>"Certainly madam (cried the youth); you &s;hall now &s;ee that I can do a genteel thing to the ho|nour of England, which is, after all, the only England in the whole world."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="96">Saying this, he opened the pur&s;e and bade the little boy put in his head and eat guineas till his belly was full of them; but the joke of this circum&s;tance laid, in an endeavour to pinch the poor child's <HI>no&s;e,</HI> by tightening the &s;trings when he had made an effort to &s;ucceed. A &s;econd &s;troke of wit, con&s;i&s;ted in offering one, who looked like a Jew, a guinea, if he would &s;uffer our hero to cut off his beard; and one je&s;t of &s;uperlative brightne&s;s was re&s;erved for an in&s;ult upon a woman bent double by age, and who&s;e cheeks were ploughed by the fur|row of time into wrinkles. Our
<PB N="85" REF="97">
generous young gentleman pro|mi&s;ed to give her an ortolon if &s;he would promi&s;e to <HI>chew</HI> it. Here the je&s;t lay in the poor creature's having lo&s;t all her teeth. He then propo&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould have, for her own u&s;e, as many livres as he could put into her wrinkles, provided that &s;he hobbled off with them to her own hou&s;e without letting them drop, in which ca&s;e they were to be his who &s;hould find them. The famine-&s;truck wretch, urged by the pleadings of nature, under&s;tood enough of his bad French to com|prehend this &s;trange propo&s;al, and &s;aid &s;he complied with it, and I do actually believe he would have
<PB N="86" REF="98">
gone on with the joke till he had lined her face with &s;ilver, though he had &s;tuck every livre into her cheek, at the price of her pain and blood. This, I &s;ay, he mo&s;t likely would have done, had not the tender|hearted Amelia run again to the window, while the colour of true &s;hame for her countrymen came into her face, and, out of her own pocket, di&s;pen&s;ed to every petitioner a trifle, and advi&s;ed them to depart in peace.</P>
<P>This action interrupted the cour&s;e of my countryman's humour, and, by way of polite revenge, he put his hand pa&s;&s;ionately into his pur&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="99">
and di&s;charged &s;everal guineas at the heads of the mendicants as they were departing. Thus, for once, a very excellent circum&s;tance of joy to the unfortunate, aro&s;e out of an action in which the heart had no &s;hare.</P>
<P>For my own part, I &s;allied out into the &s;treet, and &s;tood guard while the &s;cramble was over; for I did not doubt but when the &s;quan|derer cooled, he would be mean enough to ca&s;t a longing, lingering look after that money, which he had lavi&s;hed while he was warm.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="100">Amelia's heart &s;miled in her face upon this occa&s;ion, and the bucks con&s;oled them&s;elves, with ob&s;erv|ing, that the lady might laugh, but &s;he had been the means of &s;poiling a good joke for all that.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, thought I&mdash;the rea&s;on is plain&mdash;it is to &s;uch lovers of plea&s;ure and polite&s;&s;e as the&s;e we may attribute tho&s;e impo&s;itions, of which &s;ober and &s;en&s;ible travellers complain. Such &s;triplings who are inclined to wander, and cur&s;ed with a fortune which allows the means of doing it, having no &s;ettled plan either of acting or thinking, come
<PB N="89" REF="101">
into a foreign country, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by the &s;plendor of mi&s;chief. They can find a ravi&s;h|ing plea&s;ure in taking out a bag full of Louis when they want only a livre. They are pitiful enough to imagine there is a dignity in the di&s;play of money, and &s;o let every man look into the bottom of the pocket at once. They have the plea&s;ure al&s;o to exert the &s;pirit of an Engli&s;hman as they term it, at every inn upon the road, and the &s;till &s;mall reque&s;t would make the waiter tender his &s;ervices full as well, yet Engli&s;hmen of &s;pirit deal their commands vociferou&s;ly about them, and i&s;&s;ue their ridiculous
<PB N="90" REF="102">
orders at the utmo&s;t extent of the voice. The&s;e bri&s;k young gentle|men, al&s;o, concentre the &s;ublime of their delight, in the clatter of carriage-wheels, the crack of whip|cord, and the delicious clatter of a couple of dozen iron &s;hoes, &s;truck forcibly by half a dozen hor&s;es again&s;t a rugged pavement, and I am in doubt whether the circum|&s;tance of the French roads being &s;toney, hath not, as much as any thing el&s;e, contributed to render them popular, in the e&s;timation of the <HI>helter-&s;helter</HI> race of travellers: for every body, who is acquainted with the ambition of our Engli&s;h youths, can tell, that, it's la&s;t ma&s;ter-&s;troke
<PB N="91" REF="103">
con&s;i&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing rapidly, within the breadth of a barley-corn, <HI>by</HI> another carriage; and he who can turn a corner quicker, and &s;horter, than an hackney-coachman, hath arrived at &s;uch an excellence, as entitles him to inconte&s;ted &s;upe|riority.</P>
<P>Men of &s;pirit too we have among&s;t us, in whom &s;hoots up the &s;pirit of travel, who feel the po|lite&s;&s;e in all its poignancy, from &s;eeing a couple of po&s;tillions in their laced jackets, with half a dozen brutes, have the honour to enter a city before the men of &s;pirit them|&s;elves, and they take to them&s;elves
<PB N="92" REF="104">
all that &s;tare and admiration which is paid to the number of hor&s;es, and to the ornaments of the equi|page. The joy of &s;uch too, ari&s;es from doing the very action of which a rational traveller would be a|&s;hamed; for they admire the poli|te&s;&s;e of paying &s;o re&s;pectable a piece of money as a French crown, becau&s;e an Engli&s;hman, for&s;ooth, ought, for the honour of his country, to de&s;pi&s;e all connection with &s;uch mor&s;els of money, as pa&s;s in ex|change of a &s;ingle livre upon the Continent.</P>
<P>The innkeeper &s;ees all the&s;e prodigalities, and hath generally
<PB N="93" REF="105">
enough of the world about him, to make out his bill according to the conduct of his cu&s;tomers. He per|ceives that every Engli&s;h booby, who is broke from &s;chool, or the apron-&s;tring of his mother, gets a weak father's con&s;ent to make up a pur&s;e, with which he is to make him&s;elf more exten&s;ively ridiculous. Hence it is, that the di&s;grace of prodi|gality is marked as the characteri&s;tic of our country; from which im|putation the hone&s;t travellers, who are contented with a pair of hor&s;es, and a decent dinner, decently or|dered in a quiet articulation, which be&s;peaks us at peace with all men; hence, I &s;ay, it is, that tho&s;e tra|vellers
<PB N="94" REF="106">
who are low-thoughted enough, to &s;eparate the gold from the &s;ilver, and the &s;ilver from the copper, can, with difficulty, re&s;cue them&s;elves from ignominy.</P>
<P>Amelia was &s;urveying our heroes with one of tho&s;e looks, which denote the di&s;plea&s;ure of the heart, when the <HI>younge&s;t</HI> &s;tarted up with that &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of agility, which is u&s;ually the characteri&s;tic of people, who&s;e heels and heads are equally light, &s;wearing that it thundered as if Heaven and earth were coming, by mutual con&s;ent, together! The waiter appearing, decided a wager of fifty guineas (that were &s;taked
<PB N="95" REF="107">
on the table by the&s;e Briti&s;h di&s;|putants) one of whom a&s;&s;erted it was the noi&s;e of a waggon, and the other, as hath been ob&s;erved, that it was thunder. It proved to be neither; for the real cau&s;e of the &s;ound &s;hewed it&s;elf in a few mi|nutes, and proved to be the &s;tage|coach or diligence from Calais to Paris, which, at that in&s;tant, was, as I imagined, about to &s;et off for the city. The appearance of this ve|hicle was a &s;ource of infinite wit to our jokers, one of which in&s;i&s;ted that he had won his wager, for that it was, to all intents and purpo&s;es, a waggon, and a very ugly, ill-contrived waggon into the
<PB N="96" REF="108">
bargain: the other wit maintained that he al&s;o was willing to abide by his bargain, &s;ince he would be judged by me, Amelia, and the whole world, whether the thing, which now darkened the window, and half the &s;treet, was not a great deal more like a cloud, out of who&s;e womb i&s;&s;ued thunder, than either a &s;tage-coach or a waggon?</P>
<P>"This (&s;aid I to Amelia) is the lucky moment! We &s;hall now get rid of our trouble&s;ome countrymen. You may be a&s;&s;ured they have too much Engli&s;h blood in their veins to be dragged to Paris in this &s;tage|coach, this waggon, or this thun|der;
<PB N="97" REF="109">
while they, therefore, are di&s;|puting what to call it, let us go and &s;ecure &s;eats in this very ma|chine, however unweildy, and, if po&s;&s;ible, pay our quota unnoticed, and be gone.</P>
<P>There is a good degree of hazard in obeying, implicitly, the fir&s;t im|pul&s;es; and, except in ca&s;es of pity and kindne&s;s, where a worthy object is waiting for one's liberality, I &s;carce know a &s;ingle in&s;tance, in which it is not be&s;t to wait, for the &s;uffrage of &s;econd thoughts. A man, however, is &s;o plaguely fond of a fre&s;h idea, the moment it is &s;tarted, that he dances about with
<PB N="98" REF="110">
it, as a fond mother might be &s;up|po&s;ed to gad about with the fir&s;t|born, for the pride of &s;hewing the little idol to her friends.</P>
<P>I went incontinently into the &s;treet, followed by the ma&s;ter of the hotel; and, finding that two places were to be had, and only <HI>two,</HI> I caught at them with the greate&s;t avidity, paid down my money chearfully, without paying any regard to the clum&s;y con&s;truc|tion of the conveyance, and &s;haped into the parlour again, as having fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s charmingly.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="111">One trip generally brings on another; and I have ob&s;erved that, when either man or hor&s;e is &s;et in for &s;tumbling, it is well if he does not come to the ground. "I have ju&s;t hit it Amelia (&s;aid I), and, as good luck will have it, there were but two places vacant."</P>
<P>Two words, mal-a-propos, &s;et the heart totally wrong. I be|trayed the whole project; for the Engli&s;h wits &s;aw that I wanted to quit their company.</P>
<P>"But two places! (echoed they); then will we ride upon the coach-box."
<PB N="100" REF="112">
Upon hearing there was no coach-box, to a French &s;tage-coach, "Then (&s;aid they) will we ride in the ba&s;ket; for travel from Calais to Paris, in &s;ome part or other of that mon&s;trous machine, we a&s;&s;uredly will, even though we were to mount each of us a mi&s;erable &s;teed behind tho&s;e mi&s;erable po&s;tilions."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was determined upon, that the&s;e bundles of Briti&s;h wit were to be part of our luggage, I heartily repented of my ha&s;ty en|gagement; but it was too late, and too awkward a cri&s;is to retract: &s;o I whi&s;pered Amelia that I did not doubt, but that, even this incon|venience
<PB N="101" REF="113">
might have its counter|balance of amu&s;ement &s;ome way.</P>
<P>"All for the be&s;t:" &s;aid Amelia.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h &s;triplings now ex|hibited another &s;pecimen of Engli&s;h prudence, in the <HI>manner</HI> of di&s;|charging their bill. They had many jocular &s;trokes to make upon the &s;ize, form, figure, and variety of the French coin, none of which had the good fortune to e&s;cape a joke and a cen&s;ure: a Louis, they &s;aid was, when compared with a guinea, a mean, pitiful piece that looked French in every line, and mark of the impre&s;&s;ion. They
<PB N="102" REF="114">
had the &s;agacity to find out, that the fulne&s;s and plenitude of fle&s;h, re|pre&s;ented on the guinea, was per|fectly characteri&s;tic of King George, and his dominions; while, in the profile of Louis, as well as in the arms of that young monarch, they di&s;covered <HI>&s;omething,</HI> they could not exactly tell what, which belonged to the French nation. The French crown, they confe&s;&s;ed, was noble-&s;ized, did it not re&s;emble, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the uncouthne&s;s of the diligence, nor had they any ob|jection to the &s;mall &s;ilver coins, except that they were palpably mere copies of the good, hone&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ixpence. As to the copper coins,
<PB N="103" REF="115">
they wholly renounced and exe|crated the whole groupe, &s;wearing that they were fit for no earthly thing in the univer&s;e, unle&s;s to drive into the head of an impertinent waiter, who &s;hould have the au|dacity to &s;hew that he was a man, after he had been treated as a brute.</P>
<P>During this &s;cene of wit, Amelia was dealing forth her charity to a poor Franci&s;can, who was addre&s;&s;ing her heart through the window: turning &s;hort, therefore, to the jokers, &s;he pointed with her finger to the friar: "And can you not conceive, gentlemen (&s;aid &s;he, in a very tender
<PB N="104" REF="116">
tone and turn of countenance); can you not conceive &s;ome good and amiable u&s;e, to which even the &s;malle&s;t of the pieces of money you &s;o much abu&s;e might be put? Behold, gentlemen, how tho&s;e two windows are &s;urrounded by the &s;ons and daughters of Poverty! Your hearts are there &s;olicited, in every form, and in every attitude! Can you po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvey tho&s;e ob|jects, and &s;ay the French money is inconvenient? For my part, I can conceive every thing that is excel|lent of that monarch, or that man, who fir&s;t divided a &s;ingle half crown, into &s;o many parts, each of which are &s;o extremely commodious to
<PB N="105" REF="117">
the purpo&s;es of benevolence! Ah, gentlemen, have you not yet tra|velled far enough in the world, to know that, what is to you a trifle, may, to your neighbours, be a matter of importance? The journey of life, (if you will admit, for a moment, a woman's allegory) is made &s;teep by a thou&s;and hills, dangerous by a thou&s;and declivities, and rugged by as many narrow, or de&s;ert pa&s;&s;ages. What a variety of travellers are wearied, worn, and harra&s;&s;ed upon the road! Is your pur&s;e &s;tored with French <HI>&s;mall pieces</HI> of money, what a favourable moment to &s;hew the largene&s;s of the heart! Great circum&s;tances &s;hall &s;pring from

&s;mall beginnings; and half a &s;ous, and even a liard, &s;hall, &s;ometimes, bind up the wounds of the &s;oul, and be, as it were, a crutch to help the enfeeled invalid upon his way."</P>
<P>The jokers, as &s;oon as Amelia had done, thanked her for her very excellent di&s;cour&s;e, as they termed it, upon Poverty, French Coin, and Charity; and, when they paid their bill, directed the waiter to carry a few &s;ous to the gentleman with the bald head and bare feet, to go a little way, towards buying him a night cap and &s;lippers.</P>

<P>THERE was a mi&s;take at the bottom of all this hurry: the machine was not to &s;et out till the next morning early, and it was now but ju&s;t arrived from Paris; &s;o that we had three parts of a day upon our hands, and it was the contrivance of our hearts, to em|ploy it apart from the men of wit; but this was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

The Franci&s;can bent the knee, and pre&s;&s;ed the bo&s;om, as he pa&s;&s;ed the crucifixes, which were in &s;everal parts of the church: the wits fol|lowed his example in every thing, but the appearance at lea&s;t of &s;in|cerity. The friar unlocked a large range of drawers, out of which he took the robes, ro&s;es, and other or|naments, which are made u&s;e of at the altar, on days which are &s;et apart for extraordinary ceremonies. The Franci&s;can held the&s;e with a cautious hand: Amelia looked at them with the reverence and di&s;cretion which decency requires upon every religi|ous occa&s;ion.

The Franci&s;can next took us, by a narow flight of &s;teps, into a long gallery, on each &s;ide of which were the humble lodgings of his fraternity. He opened a little door which led into his own, and pointed, with a meek and patient action of the fin|ger, to his couch of &s;traw. The ca&s;ement of the window (half over which clung &s;lips of ivy) might be about the &s;ize of a &s;ingle pane of a modern &s;a&s;h, and it was defended by bars of iron.

<P>Here, to the increa&s;e of my di|&s;tre&s;s, I found Amelia in a warm ar|gument with our young gentlemen, upon the &s;ubject of a decent deport|ment at places of public wor&s;hip.

Engli&s;hman in&s;i&s;ted, that, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;uch circum&s;tance took place, a cru|cifix was no fit object for female in|&s;pection; he, therefore, humbly made a motion, that the company would unanimou&s;ly enter into a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription, to make up &s;uch a &s;um, as would purcha&s;e a compleat &s;uit of cloaths (not forgetting a little &s;parkle of tin&s;el in the French &s;tyle) that the Deity might, in future, appear in the dre&s;s of a gentleman.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this vein of ridicule, the youth was ju&s;t holding his hat to Amelia for her &s;ub&s;cription, as we came into the room, and Amelia was parrying off the &s;troke, partly

She had no time to go on: the rage of the Fran|ci&s;can, at the &s;ight of the crucifix, over which the wit had thrown his pocket-handkerchief, was worked into a pious enthu&s;ia&s;m, and his heart dictated to our &s;triplings a very &s;evere and &s;ea&s;onable le&s;&s;on.</P>

<P>WE all prepared to depart; and, in pa&s;&s;ing through the body of the church, the heart of Amelia was caught by the appearance of many females di&s;tributed in different parts, at their devotions.

The cheek of the per&s;on, who offered the pre&s;ent, was coloured by a reproach which bore its commi&s;&s;ion from the heart: the face of the Franci&s;can was tinged by that natural paint of virtue, which always mounts at the offer of a bribe. He had forgiven the whole
<PB N="133" REF="145">
matter before, but this offer recalled the tran&s;action; and, although a twentieth part of the &s;um would have been acceptable &s;ome time be|fore, there were now many in&s;uper|able objections. The noble inde|pendency of his late eloquence was not the lea&s;t of the&s;e: in&s;tead, there|fore, of receiving it, he tarried a|while till the heart beat pacifically, and then declined it with a good grace. The interval, however, be|twixt the making of the offer, and the final rejection, was beautifully intere&s;ting to lovers of nature.

about two or three minutes. The blu&s;h of di&s;grace is deeper and more durable than the blu&s;h of virtue.

<P>There was a mixture of good and bad in this intelligence; though Amelia, by her &s;mile, &s;eemed to &s;ay, it was a good without any alloy. Their taking advantage of our ab|&s;ence,
<PB N="170" REF="184">
to &s;ave the pride of the heart any farther mortification at our re|turn, was a &s;ymptom of &s;en&s;ibility, and might, in time, bring about de|&s;ireable improvements; but their re&s;olution to travel night and day, till they got to Paris, denoted a vio|lent relap&s;e.</P>
<P>Few events, however, are there in life, which, though in the one hand they bring evil, always carry, in the other, &s;ome portion of plea&s;ure or convenience.</P>
<P>As to the matter of convenience, nothing ever happened half &s;o apro|pos to any mortal breathing, as this

&s;udden exit of the jokers, to the poor barber. It facilitated al&s;o my &s;cheme of getting him to the Fauxbourgs St. Marceau without the drudgery, incon&s;i&s;tent with the delicacy of his pa&s;&s;ion, of &s;ticking his comb into any locks but his own.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall travel &s;nug in the ba&s;|ket of the diligence, my good fel|low (&s;aid I to the barber, who was now tripping up to the door of the hotel where I &s;tood); there may thou and thy tender &s;ecrets be as &s;ecure as thou would&s;t de&s;ire them."</P>
<P>He put his hand into his pouch, and pulling out the lining of his breeches pocket, looked as he were

looking at a dead blank: but the French &s;oon recover them&s;elves, and he is no true lover in any country, who is without &s;ome expedient, however retrogade, to vi&s;it his mi&s;|tre&s;s; e&s;pecially, if there was a proper &s;hare of danger or of diffi|culty to quicken him. Luckily for the barber, he had &s;ome ounces of romance wrought up with him, and the&s;e, with the prompting &s;pirit of love to &s;et them at work, will &s;end a man upon the full run, from one end of the earth to the other, in de|fiance of fatigue: the &s;u&s;taining idea of an imaginary godde&s;s, to &s;oothe him when the journey is over, will carry him through it.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="187">The barber, I &s;ay, had romance enough in his con&s;titution, to dre&s;s up his deity in the Fauxbourgs St. Marceau in the be&s;t manner.

Judge then how his heart mu&s;t have throbbed with exta&s;y at the propo&s;al of the ba&s;ket, till he felt into his forlorn pouch, and drew out the lining in de&s;pair.

<P>Short as was this debate, it was a little too long; for the landlord came bowing a million pardons for the rudene&s;s of the Engli&s;h noble|man's &s;ervant, who had, it &s;eems, laid his unmerciful hands upon all the be&s;t cattle. "Ah wretch with|out a con&s;cience! (&s;aid mine ho&s;t): he hath &s;eized upon the flower of

I have &s;een one brave Frenchman &s;oundly thra&s;h one brave Engli&s;hman, who fought upon the pre&s;umption of his &s;ubduing three; and the plain truth is, that man oppo&s;ed to man, in both countries, are nearly equal. True it is, that, the &s;overeign of this country hath almo&s;t unlimited power; but, on the &s;tricted enquiry, you will find that, although he is in the prime of his youth, when power is apt to be mo&s;t wanton, there is not yet upon record one &s;ingle cruelty, or &s;everity, or inequity, to &s;tain the pre&s;ent purity of the royal ermine: and, what adds not a little to his lu&s;tre, his throne hath not been &s;potted by one drop of

ho&s;tile blood; for he is at peace with all men. With re&s;pect to verdure, I pre&s;ume you have been a delighted witne&s;s that the vegeta|tion of France pre&s;ents a pro&s;pect of luxury, not inferior to the mo&s;t fertile parts of England. With re|&s;pect to bodily endowments, the farther you travel into the king|dom, the more readily will you allow that the French are by no means under&s;ized; but a grateful, well-formed &s;et of people; rather inclining (contrary to the common opinion) to height and bulkine&s;s, than to diminutivene&s;s, and to thin|ne&s;s. Upon the whole the inha|bitants of both countries have equal

rea&s;on to imagine that the provi|dence under which they are govern|ed, is ju&s;t and equal. With &s;uch an idea I hope, you, Madam, will now &s;et off for the capital of France, where you will meet with a thou|&s;and things to entertain you; and I hope you will likewi&s;e pardon the freedom of the&s;e &s;entiments, which your own ob&s;ervations brought upon you. I admire France, Ma|dam, but I love England. To the one I pay only a vi&s;it, but the other, as the &s;ong &s;ays, is my home."</P>

<HEAD>THE HEART CONCLUDES THE SECOND VOLUME.</HEAD>
<P>THE heart has now travelled, at its lei&s;ure, from London to Paris, and here it is beating at the plea&s;ing recollection of a delightful journey, in the hotel de York, which is &s;itu|ated in the Rue Jacob. It is the bu|&s;ine&s;s of memory to repre&s;ent, faith|fully, the images which are pa&s;t; and I was preparing to <HI>retrace</HI> every thing I had &s;een in the cour&s;e of my journey, &s;tep by &s;tep, in order to draw from the whole &s;urvey, the concluding &s;entiments of the heart,
<PB N="229" REF="243">
when the cherub philanthropy, who &s;poke from the lips of Amelia, per|ceived my de&s;ign; and, laying her finger upon my bo&s;om to command attention, &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>"We have now left behind us the capital of England, more than two hundred miles: we have tra|ver&s;ed a fruitful and excellent coun|try: we have met ho&s;pitality on the way. Sometimes we have met impo&s;ition; but for <HI>that,</HI> we are in|debted to the folly of our own coun|trymen. We have brought our excur&s;ion to a temporary period: we are in the capital of France. Here, we &s;hall pau&s;e, at lea&s;t till we
<PB N="230" REF="244">
have gratified our curio&s;ity by a view of all that is fair and captivating in a new city. In the mean time, &s;urely, the heart may be allowed to yield to the &s;entiments, which it ad|duces from a recapitulation of the whole matter. Having reached the metropolis, it &s;eems to be the proper cri&s;is for us to &s;etttle <HI>our opinions upon</HI> the nation, &s;o far as we are able. Will you permit, for once, a woman's heart to &s;peak upon this &s;ubject? Will you permit her to wi&s;h, that two countries, which are &s;uch near <HI>neighbours,</HI> might very long continue tender <HI>friends?</HI> From &s;uch an alliance, maintained on both &s;ides with reciprocated integrity,
<PB N="231" REF="245">
every thing that is u&s;eful, and beau|tiful, mu&s;t be inevitable! Ah, what a delightful a&s;&s;emblage of ble&s;&s;ings have I now kindled in my fancy upon this occa&s;ion! Methinks I &s;ee the fair form of <HI>Peace</HI> breathing her wi&s;hes in the mo&s;t animating elo|quence of language!</P>
<P>Too long, &s;he &s;ays, infinitely too long, hath the demon of Battle in&s;pired rival kings, with an avarice of conque&s;t; and, in the din of war, there is no lei&s;ure to reflect that every conque&s;t mu&s;t be procured at the price of general deva&s;tation. If, on one &s;ide, the victor returns loaded with &s;poils and laurels, into the arms
<PB N="232" REF="246">
of an expecting wife; the other &s;ide pre&s;ents a picture of angui&s;h, from which, victory it&s;elf might turn weeping away. A train of little children are without a father; and &s;he who was ye&s;terday exulting in the hope that &s;he is &s;till a wife, finds, to day, that &s;he is a defence|le&s;s widow; a widow too, over who&s;e wounds the oppo&s;ite party are rejoicing! How richly culti|vated are the lands of Britain and of France! but how &s;oon might the ambition of victory di&s;poil them of every beauty, and of every fertility. The &s;miling robe of verdure with which &s;pring covers the earth, the blo&s;&s;om which &s;heds perfume over
<PB N="333" REF="247">
every valley, and the fore&s;ts, which afford a &s;hade to the &s;hep|herd and to the philo&s;opher, with every other &s;cene that is now wav|ing in the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of &s;um|mer plenty, might, ere they were gilded by the beams of to-morrow's &s;un, be utterly extirpated. The rapacious genius of battle, attend|ed by his horrid in&s;truments of human carnage, inverts every joy, and every elegance of nature. Ca&s;t an eye over the foodful earth: ob&s;erve what large tracts of preg|nant territory are ripening for the &s;ickle: alas! they might all yield &s;uddenly to the &s;word of an in|&s;atiate conqueror. Admit into the
<PB N="234" REF="248">
&s;weet &s;cene which you are con|templating, the various &s;treams that take their &s;ilver circuit through the vallies; a thou&s;and flocks, the property of a thou&s;and &s;wains, are cropping the living herbs that em|broider the &s;ides of them: the harve&s;t is expected, and all is ho|liday in the heart of the hu&s;band|man, whether he is ma&s;ter of his acres in the country of England, or in that of France. Methinks I &s;ee, ea&s;t of the&s;e, ju&s;t mounted upon the &s;ummit of two hills, &s;ituated, the one on <HI>this,</HI> the other on <HI>that</HI> &s;ide the water, in order to gladden their hopes of the coming plenty! The affections
<PB N="235" REF="249">

The&s;e labourious &s;ervants of the &s;oil have both the &s;ame wi&s;hes: their cheeks are flu&s;hed with equal expectation: their hearts pant with equal ardour. The golden pro&s;pect on either hand, enters into the very &s;oul. Tru&s;ting in the mercy of one common Father who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed beam of ma|turating favour, is proportioned to the nece&s;&s;ities of univer&s;al vegeta|tion, they have neither of them the weight of a &s;ingle fear upon their bo&s;oms. The one, protected by a generous young king, and by the laws of his country, not

le&s;s protective, rejoices that he was born a Briton! The other protected by a young monarch (who&s;e heart is humanized to every virtue that can add lu&s;tre to his dignity, though all the laws, even to the law of life are in his hand) rejoices that he is a native of France!</P>
<P>Both are happy, and philan|thropy breathes forth a fervent prayer, that <HI>they,</HI> as well as all the millions, <HI>on either &s;ide of the &s;hore,</HI> who are now happy upon the <HI>&s;ame principle,</HI> may long con|tinue &s;o!"</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="251">And were I as powerful as one of tho&s;e monarchs, I &s;hould join in this &s;upplication Amelia (&s;aid I, interrupting her): you have made Philanthropy talk like her&s;elf. Never was there drawn more de|lightful pictures from the pro&s;pects we have &s;een in our journey. Here &s;top my dear traveller.</P>
<P>We are here in one of the mo&s;t bu&s;tling hotels in Paris! Though we are three &s;tories from the &s;treet, the clatter of the city, and the confu&s;ion of the bu&s;y and merry world is heard plainly! Go not a &s;ingle &s;entence farther: for if you
<PB N="238" REF="252">
were to ca&s;t but a &s;ingle glance either above, below, or on any &s;ide, the tide of your eloquence, which hath hitherto run clear as your own complexion, would be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, or &s;tained, or mixed, or ob&s;tructed. It is the place, the page, the leaf, the line, the letter in the world, to bring the Travels of the Heart (&s;o far as they relate to a journey from We&s;tmin&s;ter Bridge, to the Pont Neuf) to a <HI>conclu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>We will leave the &s;entiments of Amelia's philanthropy, to operate kindly upon the generous reader, and, when the pen is taken up
<PB N="239" REF="253">
again, upon this &s;ubject, his heart &s;hall be invited to &s;cenes which will be drawn from human nature, as &s;he exhibits her&s;elf in Paris.</P>
