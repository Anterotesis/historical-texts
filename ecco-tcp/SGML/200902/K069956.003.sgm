<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ladies were &s;oon at a fit di&s;tance for Sir Armine's purpo&s;e. He loitered behind, complained that the relics of the gout &s;till enfeebled him, "And, alas! my beloved, my favorite and mo&s;t favored &s;on," &s;aid he, "I li|terally &s;tand in need of a &s;upport; a dear and tender child is the be&s;t crutch on which a parent can lean; it is one which Providence be&s;towed in the days of his youth, to &s;u&s;tain and to comfort his age."</P>
<P>Here Sir Armine took hold of Henry's arm.</P>
<P>They were both &s;ilent for &s;ome paces. "Whata reliance is this!" re&s;umed Sir Armine, leaning on Henry; "it is a pillar that &s;u&s;tains the &s;oul as well as the body! At this ble&s;t moment I feel my&s;elf as firmly <HI>protected</HI> as if the vigour of my own &s;pring-time of life
<PB N="2" REF="11">were returned. The plant I reared repays my care. It is become the mo&s;t goodly tree of my little garden."&mdash;He pau&s;ed a moment to pre&s;s on Henry's arm yet more forcibly. "And though," continued he, "I am now grown weaker than the &s;hrub that the next rude bla&s;t may level with the du&s;t, this filial &s;up|port &s;hall prove a better dependance than the branches of the proude&s;t oak! yea, were they formed into crutches lined with the down of the cygnet's bo&s;om! nay, in the conflict of my la&s;t hour, which, you know, my Henry, <HI>cannot</HI> be remote, this prop"&mdash;lifting up his &s;on's wreathed arm to his lips&mdash;"&s;hall attemper the &s;torm of death, and give me, on the verge of the world, a foreta&s;te of what awaits an honoured Parent and an ex|piring Chri&s;tian in Heaven&mdash;a perfect reli|ance on the <HI>heavenly</HI> Father."</P>
<P>Henry's pre&s;ent emotions excited by this di&s;cour&s;e annihilated the pa&s;t; and in remem|bering he was a &s;on, he even forgot he was a lover. Returning his father's embraces with tearful rapture, he conjured him, in a voice that the union of love and duty only
<PB N="3" REF="12">can in&s;pire&mdash;he conjured him to lean the whole weight of that body and of that &s;oul Sir Armine had mentioned entirely upon him.&mdash;"The &s;trength of my affection is equal to it all," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"I believe, hope, and feel it, Henry," re|turned Sir Armine, "and the trial that is pre|paring will but confirm the a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;He pau&s;ed and wept.&mdash;The life or death of his father is in the hands of his &s;on! Henry, you mu&s;t prepare early to-morrow to begin a journey, in company with Mr. Clare, his daughter, and my&s;elf: a journey, my &s;on, at the end of which, if youth, beauty, and inno|cence; if fame, fortune, and love unbounded; if that religion, of which I hope &s;oon to &s;ee you&mdash;with all humility be it &s;poken&mdash;a wor|thy mini&s;ter; if all the&s;e, in ble&s;&s;ed union, can render a human being happy, you will be the happie&s;t of mankind."</P>
<P>Henry, upon whom was now forced a re|membrance of him&s;elf, was about to reply, when Sir Armine, &s;eeing &s;omething of re&s;i&s;t|ance and agitation in his air, pre&s;&s;ed more eagerly his hand, and &s;aid&mdash;"Name not to me
<PB N="4" REF="13">your bo&s;om prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Ina&s;much as you conquer them for the &s;ake of what you owe to duty and religion, that is, to me and to God, you will be meritorious. The matter lies in a narrow compa&s;s," continued Sir Ar|mine, rai&s;ing his voice awfully, and dropping Henry's hand&mdash;"you &s;elfi&s;hly unite your&s;elf to the daughter of your father's enemy; ENEMY to his per&s;on, family, and faith, whatever glo&s;s he may, I fear for no virtuous rea&s;on, now put upon it, or to the daughter of your father's FRIEND, in all things that can give a title to that &s;acred character: and in one word, in&s;tead of my dying thanks, my ex|piring reproaches will attend you as your de|termination pro&s;pers or oppo&s;es this great ob|ject of my bane or ble&s;&s;ing. It is &s;uperfluous for me to &s;ay more; and I will expect your an&s;wer in your conduct, not your words. With me, when my opinion is formed, they are only wa&s;te of time, you know."</P>
<P>Without waiting for reply of any kind, Sir Armine ha&s;tened, un&s;upported, to the ca&s;tle, dreading more the pain of a &s;peech that might thwart his favourite purpo&s;e, than the pangs
<PB N="5" REF="14">of his gout; or, perhaps, he lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the latter in the greater apprehen&s;ion of the former.</P>
<P>They were indeed within a few paces of the ca&s;tle, as Henry was a&s;cending, in di&s;ordered &s;ilence, the &s;teps at which Olivia and Lady Fitzorton pre&s;ented them&s;elves to view. The former had tript down the long flight of &s;tairs to give her arm to Sir Armine; and as &s;he was conducting the old gentleman in this manner, Henry took notice of a circum&s;tance, which added, not a little, to his confu&s;ion. He perceived that Olivia had quitted her mourn|ing, and was, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the death of a relation of the family, in colours. Lady Fitzorton perceiving he ob&s;erved this, whi&s;|pered to him to follow the example, &s;ince the white hours, &s;aid &s;he, ble&s;&s;ed be God! are at la&s;t returned. Well might he have replied in the language of Hamlet&mdash;
<Q><L>'Tis not alone this inky cloak, good mother,</L>
<L>Nor cu&s;tomary &s;uits of &s;olemn black,</L>
<L>That can denote me truly.</L></Q>
The embarra&s;&s;ment, however, of any reply was taken off by the appearance of the good
<PB N="6" REF="15">old Mr. Clare, who coming up to Henry, with an air and a&s;pect of ineffable benignity, exclaimed, but it was plain to be &s;een he had been weeping, "At length, Henry, I am about to entru&s;t you with a trea&s;ure, which, were I not a&s;&s;ured you know how to prize even ac|cording to its value, I would not, for all the wealth of all the worlds that pay homage to their god below or above, put you in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of! But, at pre&s;ent, I mu&s;t borrow her a few minutes even from you, having occa&s;ion for her &s;ervices."</P>
<P>Olivia and her father left the room. Hen|ry's heart &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t with variety of agonies &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and uttering a terrify|ing groan, he flung him&s;elf fir&s;t into a chair, and then at Sir Armine's feet, pa&s;&s;ionately embracing his knees with one hand, and Lady Fitzorton's arm with the other.</P>
<P>His parents rai&s;ed him from his pro&s;trate po&s;ture, and each taking hold of him&mdash;"Son," &s;aid Sir Armine, "nothing truly great or noble was ever done without exertion. The &s;ub|lime duties demand, and de&s;erve it. You are tru&s;ted with all my motives. You are in the
<PB N="7" REF="16">confidence of my &s;ituation: a confidence de|nied to the re&s;t of my children&mdash;for I have neither told John nor James of my misfor|tune, nor of the genero&s;ity that removed it. To you I would owe the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of your family! After the appeals which have been made to your con&s;cience on the points of filial Duty and Religion, it were needle&s;s to add more rea&s;ons for your ready obedi|ence; but I am this day permitted to inform you that Sir Rowland Firtzorton, allied equal|ly to our family and to that of the Clares, has left the Ad&s;ell e&s;tate, which yields &s;even thou&s;and pounds a year, to Olivia, on condi|tion <HI>only</HI> of her marrying one of our name and blood; and the fortune goes out of both families to public u&s;es, &s;pecified in his whim|&s;ical will, in ca&s;e &s;he fulfils not the obligation. By way of generous &s;urpri&s;e to your heart, which &s;he has all along believed wanted no inducement in its love, it has been Olivia's prayer to her father, that this circum&s;tance &s;hould be re&s;erved to the hour at which the day of marriage might be fixed; and though my friend and I have faithfully kept promi&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="17">it has been with much difficulty &s;he has ad|hered to her own re&s;olves, on the idea of its being cruel to withhold from you any good."&mdash;"Generous even to cruelty!" &s;ighed Henry.</P>
<P>"Among&s;t other &s;ingularities of the te&s;tator, he has &s;tipulated," re&s;umed Sir Armine, "to have the marriage ceremony&mdash;for &s;hame, my &s;on, be more firm, at what do you tremble? to have, I &s;ay, the marriage ceremony per|formed at the altar of the chapel where he him&s;elf was united to his Lady, and that the wedding &s;hould be kept holy in the room which was his own bridal apartment, giving, as a rea&s;on for this, a &s;uper&s;titious, but yet tender prophecy, that the young couple would be the happier from celebrating their nuptials in the place which confirmed his own felicity with the lovelie&s;t and be&s;t of women."</P>
<P>"Surely, my beloved child," &s;aid Lady Fitz|orton, gently pre&s;&s;ing his hand to her bo&s;om, "the&s;e accumulated motives might reconcile a heart like yours to forego a partiality, which, whatever may be the merit of the object, neither duty to your parents, your friends, nor your&s;elf, permits you to cheri&s;h; I might
<PB N="9" REF="18">have added, duty to your God; for though you have of late neglected all offices, all &s;tudies, you cannot but feel that a &s;acred pro|fe&s;&s;ion &s;hould again be cultivated."</P>
<P>Sir Armine perceiving Henry &s;till agitated, and divided what part to take, his embraces te&s;tifying the de&s;ire he had to obey, and his tears manife&s;ting his pa&s;&s;ion for Caroline; "Henry," &s;aid Sir Armine, "no good man <HI>can</HI> be mi&s;erable with Olivia Clare! and no good man, under like circum&s;tances, could be happy with Caroline Stuart!"</P>
<P>Henry &s;till &s;huddered at the name, and he &s;eemed to think, that if it was intended he &s;hould profit by good coun&s;el, this was not a time to couple Olivia with Caroline in any admonition.</P>
<P>Sir Armine pointed to Lady Fitzorton, and &s;aid, "Behold an illu&s;trious example for you to follow. This beloved woman was the object of my affectionate e&s;teem, not of my youthful enthu&s;ia&s;m. A great and commanding duty fir&s;t united me; I did not romantically love, but I did mor. I revered, I honoured; on that honour, that reverence, I made her my
<PB N="10" REF="19">wife; &s;ince which, more than half a century has gone &s;miling by, and in all that time, &s;he has been as my own &s;oul. Henry, prove your&s;elf worthy of us. Make us proud&mdash;or, farther out&s;tripping us in the glorious career of filial piety&mdash;humble thy father and thy mother, which the Lord thy God has given thee."</P>
<P>He led Lady Fitzorton out of the apart|ment, &s;aying to her&mdash;"Madam, the honour and happine&s;s of your family is &s;afe. To-morrow will our filial pre&s;erver prepare his hand and his heart."</P>
<P>"To-morrow, Sir! Good Heaven!" que&s;|tioned and ejaculated Henry, and once more he fell at his father's feet; but Sir Armine, di&s;engaging from his embrace, hurried away, firmly &s;aying to Lady Fitzorton&mdash;"There is but a moment on this &s;ide my de&s;truction and your favourite &s;on's di&s;grace, Madam: if you would prevent both, a&s;&s;i&s;t me in making our e&s;cape." Then, turning to Henry, he ex|claimed&mdash;"To-morrow, at fix o'clock of the morning, I &s;hall find my &s;on prepared!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Pale as the gho&s;t, that by the gleaming moon</L>
<L>Withdraws the curtains of the murderer's bed,</L>
<L>So pale and cold at heart, he look'd around!</L></Q>
<P>SUCH was preci&s;ely the &s;ituation of Henry. He &s;at for &s;ome time motionle&s;s, then attempted to examine his condition. There is &s;carce an emotion of which the human heart is capable, but took its turn to tyrannize. At one time, his di&s;tempered &s;ancy painted the ruin, and even the poverty of his parents, brought about by the indul|gence of his fatal pa&s;&s;ion. He thought he &s;aw them &s;tretched on their dying beds, with their la&s;t breath accu&s;ing him as the cau&s;e of their de&s;truction. His filial heart &s;hrunk as from the crime of parricide. He re&s;olved, in that afflicting moment, to &s;acrifice his love to his duty; but in the next in&s;tant his imagination &s;ugge&s;ting his vows to Caroline, and the mi|&s;eries he &s;hould entail on him&s;elf, and perhaps on the innocent Olivia, made that offence more foul to his foul than the mo&s;t deter|mined
<PB N="12" REF="21">di&s;obedience. "This," cried he, &s;miting his brea&s;t, "would be wor&s;e than &s;elf-murder&mdash;wor&s;e than that impiety, again&s;t which the 'Omnipotent has &s;et his &s;eal.' Alas, Ca|roline! though Fortune were to remain my cruel per&s;ecutor for years to come, &s;hould not this hand be re&s;erved even to the end of life for thee; and were it never permitted to be united to thine, could my devoted heart, my violated con&s;cience, offer it to another without trea&s;on to honour, to tenderne&s;s, and to truth! And, lea&s;t of all, can I pre&s;ent it to thy brother's adored Olivia! Does filial duty require me to violate the &s;acred laws of Love and Friend&s;hip? Shame on &s;uch virtue! It is unnatural. I renounce it!"</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;truggles he retired to his chamber, whither he was accompanied by True George, who, &s;eeing his ma&s;ter agi|tated, and thinking re&s;t would be the mo&s;t likely means of re&s;toring him, began, as u&s;ual, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. He intreated his Honour would plea&s;e to go to bed; ob&s;erving, that a little &s;leep would do him good&mdash;"Sleep!" exclaimed Henry, throwing him&s;elf on the bed; "O that
<PB N="13" REF="22">it were my everla&s;ting one!"&mdash;The poorfellow &s;hook at hearing this ejaculation, accompa|nied as it was with the mo&s;t extravagant voice and ge&s;ture, as if his own la&s;t hour had been at hand.&mdash;"George," cried Henry, "thou art, thou ha&s;t been proved faithful, and of that fidelity I mu&s;t now make another trial." The countenance of the hone&s;t dome&s;tic bright|ened in an in&s;tant, and without lo&s;ing any time in profe&s;&s;ions, or offers of &s;ervice, except by giving a&s;&s;ent at almo&s;t every word his ma&s;ter uttered, he &s;tood eagerly waiting for the word of command.&mdash;"My dear parents," con|tinued Henry, "are going to make me the mo&s;t infamous and mi&s;erable of human kind; my brothers, my whole family, and even the Clares, are in the plot again&s;t my peace. I have no dependance, no hope, but from thee!"&mdash;George's whole frame quivered with impati|ence.&mdash;"To-morrow I am, by their joint con|trivance, to be ruined; to-morrow they have determined I &s;hall break my mo&s;t &s;acred pro|mi&s;es, my mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths; to-morrow, therefore, my heart al&s;o will be broken, if I am not pre&s;erved from the impending &s;troke
<PB N="14" REF="23">to-night!"&mdash;George traver&s;ed the room at a &s;tride, and ejaculated, "To-morrow, to-night! to-night, to-morrow!"&mdash;A ca&s;e of pi&s;tols hung over the chimney-piece in Henry's chamber; and George, as if by an involuntary impul&s;e, ha&s;tily took them down, and held one in each trembling hand, intimating, though he &s;poke not a word, that he was now doubly armed, and only wanted the orders of his &s;uperior to &s;hoot any body and every body through the head, that &s;hould &s;tand in the way of effecting his ma&s;ter's e&s;cape from this terrifying cata|logue of ills.</P>
<P>"O Heavens!" cried Henry, at the unex|pected &s;ight of the pi&s;tols. An often &s;ugge&s;ted and de&s;perate idea &s;eemed to re&s;ume its do|minion.&mdash;"Gracious Heaven! I thank thee, good fellow, for the hint."&mdash;"The hint, Sir?" que&s;tioned the trembling George&mdash;"what hint?" "Alas!" exclaimed Henry; "how many ea&s;y ways are there of e&s;caping the tyranny of friends or foes! By the help of one of the&s;e friendly in|&s;truments," continued he, catching &s;uddenly at one of the pi&s;tols, "I might, in one moment, avoid, perhaps, a long life of mi&s;ery!"&mdash;"But
<PB N="15" REF="24">what will become of you after?" cried George. "And can this be a crime?" re&s;umed Henry. "A terrible one, your honour," interpo&s;ed George; "the Lord gives, and the Lord only can take away."&mdash;"Or," continued Henry, not attending, "if a crime, can it be &s;o atrocious, &s;o immitigable, &s;o beyond God's forgivene&s;s or man's &s;alvation, as that which pro&s;titutes for gold the &s;anctity of the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows made in the pre&s;ence of that God, and fal&s;ify the mo&s;t awful engagements? If both are evils, both iniquities; is not that the lea&s;t, which, to prevent the ruin of <HI>many,</HI> de&s;troys but one?"</P>
<P>While Henry was entering into the latter part of this &s;elf-debate, too often di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame way, George, who &s;till trembled from head to foot, &s;ub&s;tituted action for words, by wrenching the pi&s;tol from his hand, and di&s;|appearing amid&s;t a profu&s;ion of bows. Henry had &s;carce time to reflect on what had been done, before George came again bowing into the apartment, without any deadly weapon, and making a number of &s;ilent apologies for the liberty he had taken; at length, perceiv|ing
<PB N="16" REF="25">a frown gathering on his ma&s;ter's brow&mdash;"I hope your honour will not be offended at my obeying your honour's commands."&mdash;"Di&s;obeying them, you mean," an&s;wered Hen|ry.&mdash;"No," replied George, "you told me you &s;hould be ruined to-morrow, if not pre&s;erved to-night. Providence &s;ent me to your ho|nour's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for I don't &s;ee how a man is to ruin him&s;elf, if another man takes out of his hand all <HI>ruinating</HI> weapons; at lea&s;t he mu&s;t thereby get time to think better of it; &s;o you may now go into a comfortable bed, and to-morrow may come as &s;oon as God plea&s;es to give it us. Ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord!"</P>
<P>The fervid devotion and humility with which George uttered this, bowing his head and folding his hands each time he &s;poke that name, which claims the reverence of all creation, di&s;armed the ri&s;ing re&s;entment of Henry, who extended his hand in te&s;timony of forgivene&s;s, and &s;eeming to acquie&s;ce in what had been &s;aid, went to his chamber, and de&s;ired to be left to his repo&s;e. George, who was now ea&s;ed of his terrible apprehen&s;ions,
<PB N="17" REF="26">departed; but the poor fellow returning on tiptoe, and gently opening the door, about an hour after, to &s;ee that all was well, having perhaps &s;till &s;ome fears, found Henry had ri&s;en from his bed, and by the glimmering light of the lamp had been writing a letter. He was fold|ing it up as George came in. "This is the trial I &s;poke of, George," &s;aid Henry, as he wafered the letter. "It is to Lieutenant Stuart, and re|quires an immediate reply. He is at the ab|bey. Denni&s;on will take it to his apartment; and as the old man, you know, &s;leeps apart from the family, it may be managed without alarm."</P>
<P>The latter part of the&s;e directions were lo&s;t in air; for George was at the bottom of the &s;tairs, and making his rapid way, but with in|audible &s;teps, to the &s;treet-door, before they were uttered, &s;etting off at full &s;peed with the words&mdash;<HI>immediate reply.</HI></P>
<P>Henry now betook him&s;elf again to his bed; but it might be truly &s;aid, Caroline had "murdered &s;leep;" or rather, &s;he, in com|bination with many more, con&s;pired to bani&s;h that lenient power from &s;hedding balms on
<PB N="18" REF="27">his pillow. The morrow began to dawn, and he anticipated all the horrors of a marriage, into which even tender parents plunged him; and while they knew his heart to be utterly aver&s;e, and on which, therefore, a train of mi&s;chie&s;s threatened to attend their beloved, their favourite &s;on, and his po&s;terity, "even to the la&s;t &s;yllable of recorded time." The motives of the parents were undoubtedly ma|nifold and mighty; but the &s;ingle objection of the child, declared, and un&s;haken by all tho&s;e motives, each of which he felt and acknow|ledged, &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have re&s;erved to him the right of withholding his hand from an object of his indifference, if it could not be given to that of his choice. Yet how many, in all otherre&s;pects excellent parents, are there, who refu&s;e the darlings of their hearts this comparatively happy alternative! Should any of this de&s;cription peru&s;e the&s;e annals, let the natural con&s;equences of &s;imilar error prevent them from carrying their de&s;igns into effect.</P>

<P>WHILE the intended victim of the Fitz|ortons was anticipating the &s;acrifice of all his happine&s;s, how differently pa&s;&s;ed away the hours in the apartments of Olivia!&mdash;Virtuous love, in like circum&s;tances, has ten thou&s;and times been felt by virtuous women, but has never, perhaps, been de&s;cribed even by them&s;elves without an injury to that feeling. And, in|deed, the combined &s;en&s;ations of love, firmly believed to be fondly reciprocated, of inno|cent pa&s;&s;ion, and of virgin mode&s;ty, &s;eem too bold for the contracted powers of language;&mdash;the language of love it&s;elf. The truly ami|able young creature, whom the Reader, long ere this, we tru&s;t, both loves and pities by turns, experienced the &s;weet <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of all tho&s;e bitter emotions which were afflicting the mind of her beloved Henry.</P>
<P>As the clock &s;truck five, &s;he ro&s;e. It was in verity an April morn, both of life and na|ture. Olivia &s;miled and wept; and the ele|ment &s;howered and &s;hone at the &s;ame mo|ment.
<PB N="20" REF="29">the &s;ummons of preparation was con|&s;igned to Jenny Atwood, whom gratitude and her own di&s;appointed, but alas! not har|dened heart, kept wakeful. On entering the apartment, &s;he found Olivia almo&s;t dre&s;&s;ed. They greeted each other kindly, but on Olivia's face had &s;ettled one of the tears, and another, in its "cry&s;tal &s;ource," &s;tood ready; yet her cheeks glowed, and her eye looked the more bright from the lu&s;tre of that pre|cious drop, but it trembled like early dew upon the ro&s;e-bud gli&s;tening in a &s;un-beam.</P>
<P>Meantime, the unfortunate Henry was &s;till to&s;&s;ing on the bed, &s;ometimes traver&s;ing the room, and &s;ometimes in a profound reverie, debating, but unable to determine, what cour&s;e he &s;hould take. At one time he re&s;olved to yield him&s;elf up the victim of filial piety, and prepare for the ceremony; at another, he re|jected this idea with di&s;dain, and re&s;olved to ab&s;cond, attended only by True George. He even formed the outline of a plan to carry off Caroline by force, and gain over Charles to the con&s;piracy, that Olivia might make her e&s;cape at the &s;ame time; by which &s;tratagem,
<PB N="21" REF="30">his di&s;ordered fancy repre&s;ented the happine&s;s of both him&s;elf and friend, each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the object of his affection. But this thought was pre&s;ently abandoned, as the height of imprac|ticability and of madne&s;s. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e conflicts, he heard, with horror, the &s;triking of that very clock who&s;e &s;ound vibrated the tendere&s;t joys to the bo&s;om of Olivia. It an|nounced the &s;ixth hour. Terrible was it to his ear, as if it had been the knell of a friend's death! To Olivia, it was the mu&s;ic of the &s;phere. Re&s;olving and re-re&s;olving, but &s;till unre&s;olved, he ro&s;e abruptly, packed and un|packed, filled and emptied a trunk &s;everal times, and after having, at length, determined to hazard temporal and eternal mi&s;ery, rather than pro&s;titute his heart by yielding a reluct|ant, alienated, betrothed hand, be the con&s;e|quence what it might&mdash;here he pre&s;&s;ed Caro|line's miniature, with almo&s;t a convul&s;ed emo|tion, to his bo&s;om&mdash;he &s;at down with the com|po&s;ure which a man always feels, when, after deep agitation, his fluctuating opinions be|come fixed. But this calm la&s;ted only while
<PB N="22" REF="31">his imagination again took wing, which was in the &s;ucceeding moment.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is the faithful George returned from the abbey almo&s;t breathle&s;s with ha&s;te; and informed Henry, that the Lieutenant had left the abbey within an hour after his ho|nour; that he &s;et off without any &s;ervant, and left word for his &s;i&s;ter, that he &s;hould not re|turn till late in the next day.&mdash;"Left the ab|bey," exclaimed Henry, "&s;o &s;udden! Did you &s;ee Denni&s;on?" "O yes, your honour, and I know not what is the matter; but I&mdash; I fear from the young 'Squire's &s;etting off in the night-time, all alone, &s;ome har&s;h words have pa&s;&s;ed between the old gentleman and his honour; for Sir Gui&s;e is gone too." Before Henry could reply to this extraordi|nary intelligence, a me&s;&s;enger, on hor&s;eback, de&s;ired to &s;peak to True George, who &s;etting off at full &s;peed, pre&s;ently returned at full &s;peed al&s;o, and delivered a packet to his ma&s;|ter, &s;aying&mdash;"I under&s;tand it is from the Lieu|tenant, Sir: the hor&s;e that brought it is all in a foam."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32">To Henry Fitzorton, E&s;q.</P>
<P>"Seeing, O my beloved friend! we are both hovering on the extreme&s;t verge of de|&s;truction, I have been &s;ome hours on my hor&s;e, to prevent a marriage which, if <HI>not</HI> prevented, will be the precipice that mu&s;t whelm us both into in&s;tant ruin. Henry, beware! Let no|thing urge you to an action which will heap havoc and horror on both, and on all that belong to us. The &s;ecret of your love of my &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t one day or another reach the ear and pierce the heart of Olivia. I have re|flected, and find it is neither duty, honour, love, friend&s;hip, nor religion, to make your friend, your&s;elf, the woman you love, and even the woman you wed, <HI>irreparably mi|&s;erable.</HI> It is the fal&s;e doctrine of your father's prejudice, not of his good mind and fine un|der&s;tanding&mdash;not even of his nature or his faith; and it will be virtue in you to &s;ave both him and your&s;elf. You have no alter|native but flight&mdash;in&s;tant flight! Something may happen in your ab&s;ence favourable to all our loves; at any rate, the prevention of your marriage with Olivia will be an al|mighty
<PB N="24" REF="33">ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince it mu&s;t avert an om|nipotent cur&s;e&mdash;the cur&s;e of loathing her you mu&s;t &s;wear to love. I have, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend, devi&s;ed a way to make your flight look like a matter of nece&s;&s;ity. But the de|tail would take up the precious moments. Thinking me, therefore, as your guardian friend, attend to my in&s;tructions. Proceed in your preparations&mdash;be ready at your father's call&mdash;&s;eem to enter into the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of his views&mdash;begin the dreadful de&s;tined journey with alacrity, and at the edge of Ad&s;ell Fore&s;t, which you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s in your way to the hall, expect to meet a DELIVERER!"</P>
<P>So great was Henry's perturbation on read|ing this, that though he ordered True George to prepare every thing, without knowing he &s;poke, and dre&s;&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch; and though he determined to follow his friend's advice, he was by no means in a &s;tate of mind to conjecture, or indeed to connect thought on what could be intended by the promi&s;e of deliverance. The very idea, however, of e&s;caping a marriage with Olivia, and of the bare po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;erving
<PB N="25" REF="34">his hand for Caroline, gave him &s;uch alacrity in preparation, that he was the fir&s;t of the groupe to &s;alute the intended bride, whom he met, arrayed in tho&s;e bridal ve&s;tments which Lady Fitzorton's a&s;&s;iduity and ta&s;te had pre|pared. At the &s;ight of her now almo&s;t hu&s;|band, &s;he was covered from her forehead to her bo&s;om with the true "ro&s;y red" of na|tive mode&s;ty, and might literally be &s;aid to blu&s;h and breathe ten thou&s;and graces. Lady Fitzorton, and both the fathers, had be&s;tirred them&s;elves, and were bu&s;tling to get the car|riages to the door. Henry, animated by the hope which his friend Charles had in&s;pired, had a&s;&s;umed, all at once, &s;o vivid an appear|ance, not only from that hope, but from the flu&s;h of hurrying employments and emotions, that Sir Armine thought his parting words had taken effect. Lady Fitzorton wept, and Mr. Clare forgot his age, and danced for joy. For Olivia's felicity there are no words; and if it was &s;till dre&s;&s;ed "like April's &s;uns in &s;howers," it was thence only the more bright and delicious.</P>

<P>As the carriages were driving up, Mr. Partington, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the whole party, rode up on the full gallop. "Why, heydey! you abominable good-for-nothing ra&s;cals!" &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing them all; "and &s;o you thought to have &s;tolen not only a march but a match upon me, without knowing whether I forbid the banns, or give con&s;ent, did you? But I was not," added he, in the &s;ame plea&s;ant vein, "to be outgeneralled by a parcel of &s;hallow vagabonds like you. My tru&s;ty &s;couts appri&s;ed me of your operations, and brought me a full account of the enemy's motions long before the official letters of Father Fitzorton arrived at head-quarters. But, to &s;hew that I do not mean to puni&s;h you for di&s;obeying orders, I will be &s;o far from intercepting you in your expedition, that I propo&s;e to be your leader, and now give you the word of command to proceed on your march like a pack of &s;ad poltroons, as you are. To the right about! Make ready! March! Fire away!&mdash;at full trot&mdash;you &s;orry, fore-footed caitiffs!" rejoined
<PB N="27" REF="36">he, turning round the hor&s;es' heads with one hand, and performing part of the military ex|erci&s;e with the other&mdash;the huge crab&s;tick with which he always rode or walked &s;erving him for a mu&s;ket.</P>
<P>The company, accu&s;tomed to his mode of addre&s;s, took all in good part, and were made happy at the unexpected rencontre. Henry performed the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the ladies to their carriages, with an agility which was &s;till mi&s;taken by &s;ome pre&s;ent for the impatience of a lover's tenderne&s;s; and having made his bow to Lady Fitzorton and Olivia, he ordered the po&s;tillion to drive on, ob&s;erving, that he and Mr. Partington would lead the way.</P>
<P>"Now, that is as it &s;hould be; &s;o off we go, infantry and cavalry, to be&s;iege your grand|father's, old Sir Rowland's, ca&s;tle&mdash;hey, my boy!" exclaimed the bu&s;tling Partington, who appeared to be as well in&s;tructed, and as much intere&s;ted in the conduct, motives, and di&s;|patch of the journey, as if he only had the ordering of the arrangements, had fixed the day, and was going him&s;elf to be married to Olivia,</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37">The party in motion con&s;i&s;ted of Sir Ar|mine and his Lady, Olivia and Mr. Clare in the family coach, followed by Jenny Atwood and True George, in the po&s;t chariot, at Oli|via's particular reque&s;t; Partington and Henry on hor&s;eback; a &s;uit of dome&s;tics following. In this order they &s;et forward, on one of the lovelie&s;t mornings of the lovelie&s;t part of the year, and all appeared in &s;pirits &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They purpo&s;ed dividing the journey into two equal parts; &s;topping to re&s;t, the fir&s;t night, at Ad&s;ell, where they had previou&s;ly be&s;poke accommodations at an excellent inn on the we&s;tern road; and to reach the pri|ory early enough on the &s;econd day to fini&s;h the great object of their tour.</P>
<P>Nothing worthy to be recorded in this hi&s;|tory took place till, almo&s;t after the whole of the fir&s;t day's travel, they arrived at the &s;kirts of the fore&s;t bordering on the village of Ad|&s;ell, when, ju&s;t as they were de&s;cending a deep valley, enriched by a &s;tream that took its way through the woods, Partington ex|claimed, joco&s;ely&mdash;"Now, if we have any of
<PB N="29" REF="38">us our de&s;erts, we &s;hall be plundered by &s;ome of the robbers that infe&s;t this part of the fo|re&s;t! to prevent which," added he, "as the night draws on, and that pale-faced hu&s;&s;y, the moon, holds a dark lanthorn to the ho|ne&s;t gentlemen of the bullet, aiding and abet|ting, rather than di&s;covering them, let us pu&s;h on till we get clear of this plaguy wilderne&s;s, which is ab&s;olutely an encouragement to the amiable a&s;&s;ociates of the halter." Rather in &s;port than in apprehen&s;ion, Henry humoured his whim&s;ical fellow-traveller; and they had not proceeded above a couple of hundred paces farther, ere Partington, checking his own hor&s;e, and pulling the rein of Henry's, cried out, "Wo-ho&mdash;&s;top, you abominable good-for-nothing vagabond, we are ju&s;t at the &s;pot where you are to be robbed, &s;trip|ped, murdered, and ravi&s;hed!&mdash;Let me &s;ee;&mdash;Aye! this is the very place. Prepare your|&s;elf; your time is come."&mdash;He had &s;carce ut|tered this, when four &s;tout men on foot, pre|ceded by one on hor&s;eback, with vizors on their faces, ru&s;hed from behind a clu&s;ter of thick elms that, forming an angle, came ju&s;|ting
<PB N="30" REF="39">into the road. They &s;urrounded Henry, crying out&mdash;"Yield, you are among&s;t <HI>friends!</HI>"&mdash;The hor&s;eman now came up to Henry, and taking off his vizor, exclaimed, "Behold one of your DELIVERERS!"&mdash;"Charles Stuart!" exclaimed Henry.&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid Partington, "my plot is now mature; you are to be delivered&mdash;delivered, I find, from a forced marriage!&mdash;I will allow no &s;coundrel to force another. But we mu&s;t wait the arrival of the coach, becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary the old gentleman &s;hould &s;ee you carried off. You may as well &s;eem to re&s;i&s;t a little though, and I will appear to help you&mdash;but we mu&s;t both cleverly &s;uffer our|&s;elves to be overcome&mdash;and while I am mak|ing my e&s;cape, with proper difficulty, you &s;hall be carried to a place of &s;afety&mdash;namely, to my own hou&s;e, where I de&s;ire you will re|main a clo&s;e pri&s;oner." partington conducted the whole of this attack with too much rapi|dity to admit of more than &s;ilent &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;but at this moment a violent &s;hriek arre&s;ted the general attention. "Hey-dey!" cried Par|tington, &s;eeing the coach &s;urrounded by armed men, and even &s;ome of the company dragged
<PB N="31" REF="40">out, "here are more rogues than we bargained for, Stuart." Hereupon, &s;etting &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and ordering the men to follow, blud|geons in hand, Henry, and the fir&s;t body of a&s;&s;ailants, with Charles at their head, were ha&s;tening to inquire into the de&s;igns of the &s;econd, which were &s;oon di&s;covered to be of a far more ho&s;tile nature. For, notwith&s;tand|ing the di&s;patch of Partington, and his cohort, the villains had bur&s;t open the door of the carriage, and while the women were trembling and be&s;eeching mercy, two of the banditti were belabouring Sir Armine and Mr. Clare with bludgeons, which would &s;oon have put an end to their exi&s;tence, had not Partington, Henry, and the ma&s;ked men, one with the fury of an old, and the re&s;t of two young lions, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;cue. But this was not ef|fected before Sir Armine, who received a blow in his temple after he was otherwi&s;e much hurt, had fallen on the ground. While Henry and Partington were endeavouring to rai&s;e him up, the re&s;t were employed in pur|&s;uing and &s;ecuring the ruffians. True George had fa&s;tened upon the collar of one, and the
<PB N="32" REF="41">neck of another was nailed to the earth by his feet. The villain that was ob&s;erved to &s;trike Sir Armine after he was on the ground, was the prize of the victorious Charles, who, con&s;idering him as devoid even of the com|mon compa&s;&s;ion of an highwayman, in treat|ing a venerable and helple&s;s man with &s;o much barbarity, returned every blow he had inflicted on Sir Armine with tenfold intere&s;t. Nor were Partington and True George's myr|midons le&s;s liberal in <HI>their</HI> rewards of the re&s;t of the banditti, which con&s;i&s;ted of two per|&s;ons be&s;ides tho&s;e in George's cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>By this time the tender and a&s;&s;iduous Henry, who totally forgot all idea of his own e&s;|cape in the apprehen&s;ion and terror he felt for others, had &s;o far compo&s;ed the ladies, that he was at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t in lifting Mr. Clare and Sir Armine, who were both wound|ed, into the carriage. Meantime, the victors pur&s;ued their triumphant blows over the van|qui&s;hed: but villainy, though done "i'th' centre," will &s;peak, and great di&s;coveries are brought about by &s;lender means. Little Fitz, who, in the general ran&s;ack of the com|pany,
<PB N="33" REF="42">had left the coach, and was too active a &s;pectator to remount, ran to the per&s;on whom Jonathan Arm&s;trong was putting an end to, and expre&s;&s;ed more &s;igns of &s;ympathy than a &s;tranger and a ruffian had a right to claim.&mdash;Fitz, however, either from indigna|tion or &s;ome other motive, leaped on the per|&s;onage above de&s;cribed; and the moon coming from under her cloud, what could equal the &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation of the whole com|pany, when, in pro&s;ecuting their cha&s;ti&s;ement, one of George's captives turned out to be the infamous David Otley, Sir Armine's favou|rite &s;ervant, who had been tru&s;ted with or|dering the accommodations at Ad&s;ell, and who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;till in waiting there to receive the family; the other, Mr. Va|lentine Miles! and, to complete the climax of a&s;toni&s;hment, the per&s;onage under the &s;e|vere di&s;cipline of Jonathan, about who&s;e &s;ate or de&s;truction little Fitz appeared to be &s;o intere&s;ted, proved to be Sir Gui&s;e Stuart!&mdash;while Valentine Miles had been the victim of Henry and Charles alternately! The&s;e ex|traordinary di&s;coveries were made &s;o near to
<PB N="34" REF="43">the coach, that every body within, capable of &s;ight or &s;peech, exclaimed, "How! Sir Gui&s;e Stuart! David Otley! Valentine Miles!"&mdash;Sir Armine alone wanted power to know the prime offender, being utterly &s;tunned by the back-handed &s;troke he received from that implacable wretch.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE rage, grief, and &s;hame of the in|genuous Charles at this detection is not to be de&s;cribed: it was in&s;upportable to him&mdash;and giving way to a re&s;entment which &s;hook his frame almo&s;t to di&s;&s;olution, and annihilated all &s;en&s;e of affinity, he addre&s;&s;ed the trem|bling Sir Gui&s;e with an oath, by which he &s;wore, that he would &s;ee ju&s;tice executed upon him, and be him&s;elf his principal evidence, even though the public di&s;grace of an igno|minious death &s;hould be the con&s;equence. "O thou &mdash; polluter of a family which never knew a &s;tain, till in an evil hour its honour was committed to thy charge, for what &s;in, committed or yet to be perpetrated, am I condemned to think the life which thou
<PB N="35" REF="44">ha&s;t di&s;honoured was be&s;towed by thee?&mdash;As for you, wretch!" &s;aid he, turning to Miles, "and thou, his meane&s;t in&s;trument, if my cor|rection towards thee knows any bounds, it is only in the hope that the re&s;idue of your puni&s;hment will be more &s;ure and exemplary in the hands of my country, than in tho&s;e of an individual. I require, Mr. Partington, that you and your friends a&s;&s;i&s;t in conducting the&s;e offenders to the next town, where they &s;hall remain clo&s;e pri&s;oners till I can properly di&s;|po&s;e them; and do not think, abandoned a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the names of &s;on or father, from which my &s;oul alive, as it would be to every de&s;erving tie, turns with horror, &s;hall &s;creen ye from the in&s;ulted laws of your country or your God!" Partington, who deemed this no time for di&s;cour&s;e, proceeded to immediate action: he therefore arranged his men, and placed his pri&s;oners in the mid&s;t of them, in the manner of de&s;erters, taken up and moving to a court-martial. He then took the lead, and de&s;ired Charles to guard and bring up the rear.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="45">In this manner was the long-fo&s;tered re|venge of Sir Gui&s;e and his mercenaries de|feated by the very per&s;ons whom his amiable but unhappy &s;on had convened to re&s;cue his friend from a forced marriage.</P>
<P>The e&s;cort of pri&s;oners arrived at Ad&s;ell, which was about two miles from the place of attack, &s;ooner than the coach; but the inde|fatigable George and his colleagues, which were no other than Jerom and his cou&s;in Jo|nathan, for Henry had never left the &s;ide of the coach, had rode at full &s;peed, and had brought a rural &s;urgeon to the inn-gate, where he waited the coming of the carriage. The inn-yard, and &s;treet adjoining, were &s;oon crowded with &s;pectators; for, be&s;ides that, George had given the alarm, village curi|o&s;ity, who had the eyes of Argus, opened all her vi&s;ual powers to &s;ee the wonderful phaenomena of a gang of ruffians, who always afford an holiday to the vulgar, as well when they are taken to pri&s;on, as when they are &s;ent out of the world.</P>
<P>More than an hour elap&s;ed in arranging the two different parties, in &s;eparate apart|ments,
<PB N="37" REF="46">which were with difficulty procured; for David Otley had attended only to the accommodations at the fore&s;t, and neglected tho&s;e he was to have prepared at the inn, which having much company, who purpo&s;ed &s;taying all night, the ho&s;te&s;s was driven to her be&s;t management to provide beds, even for Mr. Clare, her landlord, and his friends. As to Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, and his fellow a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, Mr. Partington and Charles di&s;po&s;ed of them with very little apparatus, in conve|nient out-hou&s;es adjoining, where they were put without ceremony, under lock and key, and the tru&s;ty George &s;et over as guard, relieved occa&s;ionally by Jonathan or Jerom.</P>
<P>With equal politene&s;s and humanity, how|ever, the party that occupied the be&s;t apart|ments hearing that a gentleman and his family were brought in wounded by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, whom they had taken, offered to re&s;ign their claims as fir&s;t-comers, and to mount or de&s;cend into whatever &s;leeping-rooms the landlady could provide for them. By this civility Sir Armine was accommodated with a comfortable &s;uite
<PB N="38" REF="47">of rooms, where he might be &s;urrounded by Olivia, Lady Fitzorton, Henry, Jenny At|wood, and his attendants.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner put into a warm bed, than the &s;urgeon, who, contrary to what books u&s;ually repre&s;ent gentlemen of the faculty re|&s;ident in the country to be, was a &s;kilful and &s;en&s;ible man, de&s;ired to be left alone with the patient, whom he immediately blooded; and, finding the brui&s;es le&s;s violent than he at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected, gently fomented the parts affected with a &s;uitable embrocation; then, admini&s;ter|ing an anodyne, a&s;&s;ured the company they would &s;hew their affection in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential manner by leaving the patient to repo&s;e; "after which," &s;aid the &s;urgeon, "I do not doubt but we &s;hall find him materially re|fre&s;hed:"&mdash;And promi&s;ing to call again be|fore bedtime, and to attend early in the morn|ing, he bowed and took his leave.</P>
<P>Somewhat comforted by this favourable report, the &s;hattered party had lei&s;ure and &s;pirits to inquire about each other. Mr. Clare felt him&s;elf much recovered, having e&s;caped with only two or three blows, and
<PB N="39" REF="48">tho&s;e on no vital part. Olivia and Lady Fitzorton, who had &s;uffered only in &s;ympathy for the &s;ufferings of others, and from the na|tural terrors of &s;o &s;udden an attack, &s;eemed to revive in proportion as Mr. Clare and Sir Armine were pronounced to be out of dan|ger. Henry could not be prevailed on to quit Sir Armine's bed&s;ide, at which, begging his mother to &s;leep in another apartment with Olivia, he kept watch the whole night. On the return of the good &s;urgeon, finding the favourable &s;ymptoms continue, the re&s;t of the party felt them&s;elves &s;ufficiently at their ea&s;e to take &s;ome &s;light refre&s;hment; and after each had paid a tiptoed vi&s;it to the chamber of Sir Armine, whom the vigilant Henry &s;ig|nified, rather by ge&s;tures than by &s;peech, to be in a do&s;e, they withdrew to their apartments in order to follow &s;o good an example.</P>
<P>It &s;hould not be omitted, to the honour of his race, that little Fitz, who&s;e various good actions entitle him to be now con&s;idered as a per&s;onage of &s;ome con&s;equence in this hi&s;tory, kept watch over Sir Armine at the feet of Henry; and, except that on the en|trance
<PB N="40" REF="49">of Olivia, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ing care&s;&s;es he acknowledged, he remained there till the morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;everal characters at the inn in the be&s;t manner that the circum&s;tances admitted, it &s;eems a fit opportunity to &s;ettle a running account, not only with hi&s;toric con&s;i&s;tency, in regard to the cau&s;es which gave ri&s;e to all this mi&s;chief, but to acquit our&s;elves of the claim which is &s;o infinitely due to John Fitzorton. We left that &s;ingular young man &s;itting down to the plea&s;ing and painful ta&s;k of fini&s;hing his draw|ing of Olivia Clare. He had ju&s;t taken his pencil from retouching the well-imitated fea|tures, over which he heaved many a &s;igh, when Lieutenant Stuart was announced. John ro&s;e and ran to the door with expanded arms to receive him; but willing to pa&s;s over the &s;ubject of his promotion, which he knew might lead to what would di&s;concert the ami|cable convention &s;ettled betwixt him and Henry on that matter, he exclaimed, "I am
<PB N="41" REF="50">appri&s;ed, my good Charles, of all that gives me the &s;incere &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing you, and having you among&s;t us; but, as I &s;ee a great deal of your enthu&s;ia&s;tic friend Henry is mounting into your face, I mu&s;t cut &s;hort all unnece&s;&s;ary effu&s;ions. At a word, I think you do honour to any man's election, and I wi&s;h you the farther promotion you merit with all my heart. Are you come to remain with us now altogether?"&mdash;"No," replied Charles, "I have &s;ome affairs to adju&s;t at home before I can have the honour of a&s;&s;ociating, but thought it a fir&s;t duty to make my bow to my new Captain and Colonel, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant.</HI>" "Then you are ju&s;t in time to take letters for me to the ca&s;tle; and may I trouble you to convey a &s;mall parcel to our Olivia."&mdash;"Our Olivia!" cried Charles, reddening; "Ah! Captain Fitzorton, you know not how far nor through what perils I would go, had I a thou&s;and lives at &s;take, to render the mo&s;t trifling &s;ervice to that dear angelic girl!" "Indeed!" &s;aid John, employing all the powers of his &s;crutinizing eyes upon Charles's face, as if at the fir&s;t idea of a new di&s;covery&mdash;"Indeed!"</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51">There are moments, it is well known, which defeat the circum&s;pection of years. This was one of them. At the time, Charles intended nothing le&s;s than the unfolding of his heart to John; neither was there any thing in the occa&s;ion it&s;elf that &s;hould draw forth his confe&s;&s;ion; &s;o we can only &s;uppo&s;e this was to be the period, according to the pre|de&s;tinarians in love, ordained by the god of that pa&s;&s;ion or the godde&s;s of Fortune, for John Fitzorton to become acquainted with <HI>another</HI> of Olivia's military admirers. The &s;teady gaze with which John pur&s;ued his ob|ject, deepened the tacit declaration in the cheek of Charles, and either by reflection, or by &s;ome other cour&s;e, John felt an uncom|mon glow in his own countenance. On the repetition of the ejaculatory word, <HI>indeed!</HI> Charles found out that he had betrayed him|&s;elf, and became yet more embarra&s;&s;ed: John was di&s;compo&s;ed, and each continued to confu&s;e the other; till both &s;ought relief by turning their eyes another way. John, who of all men was the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of &s;hame, and who the mo&s;t laboured with &s;elf-reproach,
<PB N="43" REF="52">&s;oon left the room, and gave Charles oppor|tunity for one of tho&s;e painful &s;oliloquies which u&s;ually bur&s;t from a man after he has di&s;covered the &s;ecret he would conceal.</P>
<P>"And have I," &s;aid he, "after cautiou&s;ly guarding the cruel &s;ecret in my own tormented brea&s;t, and after we had agreed &s;o to &s;hut up the fatal &s;ecret till happier times&mdash;perhaps for ever&mdash;have I divulged it to the man who, of all the Fitzorton family, would be the lea&s;t likely to forgive my pa&s;&s;ion? even to John? who, noble-natured as he is, will con&s;ider my unfortunate attachment to Olivia&mdash;for, am I not a &s;on of the offending Sir Gui&s;e?&mdash;as the height of madne&s;s and pre&s;umption&mdash;nay more, I mu&s;t appear to him as the rival of his brother, my deare&s;t friend&mdash;nor can I clear my&s;elf from this idea by explaining the &s;ituation of Henry, not knowing how far affairs at the ca&s;tle may, at the pre&s;ent mo|ment, make this eligible. Doubtle&s;s, John is gone away di&s;plea&s;ed, or po&s;&s;ibly my fears may interpret fal&s;ely&mdash;he may have been &s;tartled at the warmth of the expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;and yet perhaps&mdash;perhaps no preci&s;e di&s;covery
<PB N="44" REF="53">has been made." In the mid&s;t of the&s;e rumi|nations John re-entered, and cordially taking Charles by the hand, inquired when he would wi&s;h to &s;et out for the abbey. "As &s;oon," &s;aid Charles, "as I have paid my re&s;pects to my new Colonel, and obtained his permi&s;&s;ion of ab&s;ence, which, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is a little un|rea&s;onable to begin with." "By no means," &s;aid John, generou&s;ly, "I engage to procure you both immediately. Come, my friend, di&s;|patch, you know, is the &s;oul of bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>John took hold of Charles's arm, and walked away with him &s;o readily, that the latter really believed his la&s;t reflection went to the truth; namely, that his expre&s;&s;ion had not extended to the di&s;covery of his affection for Olivia. The Colonel being found at head-quarters, John Fitzorton pre&s;ented Charles Stuart in the following manner:&mdash;"This, Sir, is the youth for whom Colonel Forbes has a friend&s;hip, of which the ba&s;is is not favour, but merit. I need not &s;ay more in his behalf to make Colonel Warren con|&s;ider him as an acqui&s;ition to the regiment; but I mu&s;t add, from my own knowledge of
<PB N="45" REF="54">his virtues, and per&s;onal bravery, that if I &s;hould be found as worthy to occupy the po&s;t of the lamented La&s;celles, as I will pledge my&s;elf this young man will approve him&s;elf of the &s;tation my promotion leaves open, and which one of my family has pre&s;ented to him, under your au&s;pices, Sir, you will have rea&s;on to be doubly &s;atisfied; and, what has rarely happened to me in any occurrence of life, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied with my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Colonel Warren received his new Lieu|tenant as &s;uch an introduction gave claim to. "But," continued John, "the youth is de&s;irous to owe to his new Colonel an indulgence on <HI>advance,</HI> even before he has done any duty. He has a lovely &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e &s;ituation re|quires a brother's immediate councils and con|&s;olation; other family affairs likewi&s;e &s;um|mon his attention; and though the diffidence which connects with high and genuine pre|ten&s;ions induces him to &s;hrink from the &s;oli|citation, I have taken upon me, on the &s;urety of your character, Sir, to come forward on the occa&s;ion."&mdash;"Young gentleman," &s;aid the Colonel, turning to Charles, "the &s;ooner
<PB N="46" REF="55">nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s is done the better; we expect &s;tirring work in the military line in another month or two&mdash;my advices of the day are pretty &s;trong&mdash;this then is the time you can be&s;t be &s;pared from the &s;ervices my regiment may expect from a man who comes into it thus <HI>doubly armed,</HI> with the recom|mendation of Captain Fitzorton and Colonel Forbes. Adieu! therefore&mdash;you will return as &s;peedily as circum&s;tances admit."</P>
<P>Proper acknowledgments being given and received, John conducted the Lieutenant to the different officers of the regiment; and after dining at the me&s;s, by way of giving to the initiatory vi&s;it all its advantages in favour of the Lieutenant, he left to the choice of that gentleman either to defer his intended jour|ney to the morning, or to &s;et out immediately. "I rather think, my dear Sir," &s;aid Charles, "that&mdash;that&mdash;that it will be expected I am now on the road;&mdash;and as&mdash;as&mdash;as you know the Colonel intimated I might be wanted in my place in a &s;hort time, it will, perhaps, be better to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;pray, what do you think your&s;elf?" John, perceiving the Lieutenant
<PB N="47" REF="56">was getting into a fre&s;h dilemma, rang the bell before the he&s;itation in the Lieutenant's &s;peech grew wor&s;e, and on the &s;ervant's ap|pearing, &s;aid, "You will make ready, and bring round to the door, this gentleman's hor&s;e:" then, turning to Charles, he added, &s;miling, "Let me be your commanding officer at pre&s;ent, in giving marching or|ders." Immediately after which he ad|verted to more general &s;ubjects, in order to take off the too keen &s;en&s;e of that particu|lar one on which he &s;aw Charles was irritable. A &s;oldier of the regiment, who attended John, &s;oon came to &s;ay, "The gentleman's hor&s;e was at the door." On which Charles, after more impediments than the &s;imple que&s;|tion &s;eemed to demand, had it not been preceded by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of little &s;tumbling blocks, ventured to a&s;k, "If the letters for Fitzorton Ca&s;tle, and the parcel for&mdash;for&mdash;for Olivia Clare, were ready?"&mdash;No," ob&s;erved John, "I find, on reflection, I mu&s;t have a little more time to make them up, and a few days more or le&s;s can make no material dif|ference."&mdash;Charles ro&s;e to take his leave.
<PB N="48" REF="57">John advanced towards him, and opened the door with one hand, while he cordially offered the other to Charles. "Lieutenant," &s;aid he, "you de&s;erve honour for your own good qualities, and generous compa&s;&s;ion for the bad ones; but I will not wound you&mdash;you are, moreover, the cho&s;en friend of our Henry Fitzorton:&mdash;for all the&s;e rea&s;ons, and for numberle&s;s others, I &s;incerely wi&s;h your hap|pine&s;s. I &s;u&s;pect, al&s;o, you are &s;omewhat too &s;en&s;ible of the charming powers of our Oli|via. Alas! do not &s;hrink from the ob&s;erva|tion; if it is unfounded, happier is it for your|&s;elf; if it goes to the fact, ah! my friend, it is no way unnatural that you &s;hould love what is mo&s;t lovely: I, you, or any other man might have been carried beyond our powers&mdash;but have a care&mdash;you have not a heart to endure the thought of breaking in upon the plan of two of the mo&s;t venerable men that ever gave lu&s;tre to the character of parent; nor could you bear to enchain an ali|enated woman, even if &s;he &s;hould be brought to &s;acrifice her&s;elf to your arms. Alas! it is with rea&s;on we make a petition again&s;t being
<PB N="49" REF="58">led into temptation, a part of our daily prayer. That changeful cheek and averted eye &s;eem to &s;ay you are going into the mid&s;t of it. My dear brother-officer, the &s;tronge&s;t of the &s;ons of men can often be &s;aved only by determined retreat. Oh, beware! You had better be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of the wretched, <HI>alone</HI> and <HI>unob&s;erved,</HI> than call in another who cannot love you, to <HI>&s;hare</HI> your fate. Ha&s;ten then your journey; but &s;hould you, at the end of it, find your &s;orrow greater than your joy, return to your appointment here, and a&s;&s;uring your&s;elf that the only remedy for the di&s;ap|pointments of life is <HI>employment,</HI> let even your calamity have the liberal effect of occupying you in &s;ome active virtue: &s;o &s;hall you, in a manner, remember others till you forget your|&s;elf.&mdash;Give my love to the family, and fare|well."</P>
<P>It was not unlucky for Charles that John precluded reply by leading him to his hor&s;e, which, having mounted, he rode away, at|tempting many &s;ilent acknowledgments, and looking as many promi&s;es&mdash;all of which, he remembered, with a predetermination to
<PB N="50" REF="59">fulfil them till he &s;aw Olivia Clare; or rather, till he &s;aw her likene&s;s in that very picture which John was fini&s;hing on his arrival, and of which it was fir&s;t intended to make him the bearer; but, after the &s;u&s;picious effu&s;ions which e&s;caped the Lieutenant, John thought this would be making him&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary in the temptation he would wi&s;h him to avoid; and though John was too generous to throw any impediments, that might &s;avour of the jealous lover, in this young man's way, he would not do any thing that might promote his unfor|tunate pa&s;&s;ion. When Charles had departed, John Fitzorton &s;at, as was u&s;ual with him in any new difficulty, in &s;ilent thought, his hands folded over his face.&mdash;"Ill-fated Charles!" &s;aid he, when he could articulate; "it is hard upon us both. We have been attracted by uncommon beauty and uncommon virtue; yet there is no quarrelling with the Creator for having made &s;uch a creature, nor with our beloved Henry for being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of happier powers to make her his own. I am very wretched, but methinks I love him the more, at lea&s;t I think the more exaltedly of his vir|tues,
<PB N="51" REF="60">for the very charm that has wrought my de&s;pair; for I am convinced that Olivia is not a woman to prefer one man to another on caprice, or the eye's ab&s;urd vanity of call|ing a hand&s;ome man her own. No, Charles, our Henry, depend on it, has endowments of <HI>mind</HI> as well as per&s;on, which we do not po&s;|&s;e&s;s, that have given him this di&s;tinction over us both."</P>
<P>John turned the point many ways without coming to any thing &s;atisfactory; and at the end of his &s;oliloquies he took the miniature from his pocket, where he had placed it on the entrance of Charles, and after gazing on it with more true admiration than Pigmalion be&s;towed on the adored ma&s;terpiece of his art, he confe&s;&s;ed he was yielding to great weakne&s;s, even though un&s;een of the world, and then, pre&s;&s;ing the miniature to his lips, retired with it to his bed-chamber. His waking thoughts were pointed again&s;t human frailty, and a very energetic philippic followed on the weakne&s;s of man and the &s;trength of woman; during which he found the re&s;em|blance of Olivia had, &s;omehow, found its way
<PB N="52" REF="61">to his pillow; but after he had ri&s;en he ex|claimed, "I &s;ee plainly little of voluntary virtue is to be expected from incorrigible mortals; all is to be done by main force&mdash;the &s;courge, the wheel, the pri&s;on, and the gibbet, are all nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments of terror! A Damocle&s;ian &s;word mu&s;t always hang over the human head! I have no &s;uperior merit to Charles, except that I am playing the fool by <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and I fear he is gone to expo&s;e him&s;elf before company."&mdash;At the clo&s;e of the&s;e re|flections, John paid his parting adorations to the picture; for by an opportunity, which happened in the cour&s;e of the following day, he &s;ent it to the fair Olivia, to prevent farther mi&s;chief to him&s;elf, and in di&s;charge of his promi&s;e. The u&s;e which that enchanting girl made of it was &s;uch as the reader has &s;een, and &s;uch as the truly generous John had fore|&s;een al&s;o.</P>
<P>The next occurrence that happened to John was one of the mo&s;t trying of his whole life, in the information which reached him by means of his father, who wrote to him in this manner:&mdash;</P>

<P>The reader perceives this epi&s;tle arrived when Henry, wholly &s;ubdued by the paternal ble&s;&s;ing on his head, had promi&s;ed to become obedient to his father's wi&s;hes, and Sir Armine took advantage of that moment to hurry off an account and invitation to his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>

<P>This an&s;wer was addre&s;&s;ed to Sir Armine, at Ad&s;ell Hall, and there met him on his ar|rival, after the di&s;a&s;trous events at the fore&s;t: but it was earne&s;tly reque&s;ted by Sir Armine, nay, and even made a condition by the apo|thecary, that Mr. John Fitzorton &s;hould not be made acquainted with tho&s;e events, nor any thing that had allu&s;ion to them, till Sir Armine judged proper, even were death to be the i&s;&s;ue; "for I fore&s;ee," &s;aid the reve|rend &s;ufferer, "that wor&s;e than death would be the con&s;equence of John's hearing of this fre&s;h outrage of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart." Sir Ar|mine bound his whole family, by an oath of honour, to profound &s;ilence, and all readily joined in it.

<P>After two days &s;ilent &s;uffering, in this man|ner, he nur&s;ed his mind into &s;ufficient com|po&s;ure to attend to the common duties of his life and &s;ituation; the heavine&s;s of the &s;torm was pa&s;t&mdash;a calm &s;ucceeded&mdash;and as he did not receive any accounts from Ad&s;ell, or the ca&s;tle, for a con&s;iderable time, he attributed their &s;ilence to their fe&s;tivity, and rather dreaded than hoped the arrivals of the po&s;t.</P>

<P>THE reader has been already appri&s;ed, that Sir Gui&s;e Stuart meditated an effectual revenge, and was prepared to expect &s;ome violent but cautious mea&s;ures; and he now &s;ees that this affray was intended to &s;atiate his evil de&s;igns; but there are various particulars which, as they cannot be known but by our explication, &s;hall now be developed. Per|haps there are &s;ome impatient &s;pirits who have already condemned us for not &s;atisfying them &s;ooner; not con&s;idering that divers are the events of life, which, whatever pain and inconvenience they give, cannot be explained till after we have &s;uffered from them, and that we often feel the blow before we di&s;cover the hand from whence it comes.</P>
<P>To untie, therefore, the &s;everal knotty points in order, as they lie before us, we mu&s;t fir&s;t u&s;e the privilege of a victor, by &s;tripping the vanqui&s;hed of whatever we deem valuable. In the pillage of the ingenious David Otley's pocket, we find the following letter from his prime &s;educer, Mr. Valentine Miles:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="60" REF="69">
<HEAD>To David Otley.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend David,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your intelligence has been communi|cated to Sir Gui&s;e and Mrs. Tempe&s;t, and is mo&s;t welcome to all of us. We are of opinion, the former plan which we had in preparation &s;hould be renounced as tedious in its proce&s;s, and uncertain in its i&s;&s;ue. The wedding jour|ney promi&s;es a more immediate, as well as a more &s;ecure way of paying off old &s;cores; for you are not to be told that all parties who join in the plot have been gro&s;sly injured; but, as there is not, I &s;ee, a moment to be lo&s;t, this is only to de&s;ire you will take the abbey in your way to Ad&s;ell, in order to re|ceive our final in&s;tructions.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful V. MILES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>From this ingenious epi&s;tle the reader learns, that Otley was wholly in the intere&s;t of Miles, to whom he communicated the fir&s;t news of the intended nuptials, time, place, &amp;c.; and being a confidential dome&s;tic, he was
<PB N="61" REF="70">employed to make a very early report at the abbey of what was in contemplation at the ca&s;tle. In the next place, we find hereby, that Mrs. Tempe&s;t entered into the my&s;teries of this confederacy; urged indeed &s;imply by the &s;pirit of a di&s;appointed woman's venge|ance; for, as to the in&s;ults which either Sir Gui&s;e or Miles had received, &s;he would, pro|bably, have &s;at with the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical patience to have &s;een either or both of them mount the &s;caffold. But the affronts they had received, &s;erved very well to cover the revenge &s;he re&s;olved to take on her own account. In truth, her de&s;igns were more deeply vindictive than the Baronet's: they went to the blood not only of the offending Henry, but of his whole family; and her hate, like her love, was a conflagration that con&s;umed almo&s;t her own life, and made it extremely difficult for her to &s;upport the ne|ce&s;&s;ary ripening of her own purpo&s;es. Her joy, therefore, was exce&s;&s;ive on the news of this promi&s;ing journey, and her impetuous fancy out&s;tripping that of her compeers, &s;ug|ge&s;ted the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination,
<PB N="62" REF="71">and had furni&s;hed "all appliances and means to boot" before either of her colleagues, fer|tile as each was in mi&s;chievous expedients, had &s;een any advantage to be derived from Otley's communication. By the&s;e means, the work of a few hours made &s;o good, or rather &s;o bad progre&s;s, that all things were arranged before &s;unri&s;e; and never, perhaps, &s;allied forth a troop of murderers more determined than the heroine Mrs. Tempe&s;t, her generals Sir Gui&s;e Stuart and Miles, and her aid de camp the renegade David Otley, and three other cho&s;en men who had been picked from the ma&s;s of their dependents, and bought up to the mo&s;t hazardous enterpri&s;e. The chief delay aro&s;e on the part of the Baronet, who, though he heartily de&s;ired to promote the work of vengeance, apprehended it might prove a &s;ervice of much danger, notwith|&s;tanding all the precautions he meant to take; and he would have been contented to &s;tay at home, and hear from his agents a hi&s;tory of the attack and its &s;ucce&s;s, without taking an active part in it. But Mrs. Tempe&s;t &s;o ex|cited him by her daring arguments and biting
<PB N="63" REF="72">reproofs, that he le&s;s dreaded to join in the attack of the common enemy, than encounter her virulent upbraidings &s;ingly. And though the &s;uperaddition of Miles's terrifying con|ver&s;ation was not wanting, it wound up his fears to a pitch that prepared him for the de|&s;truction of all the travellers. Thus, partly from &s;hame, and partly from cowardice, but, more than all, the a&s;&s;urances he received of there being little or no hazard, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to join the banditti, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in per|&s;on.&mdash;His conduct and caution afterwards in the action are already unfolded.</P>
<P>The gang were ready to &s;et out from Mrs. Tempe&s;t's lodge, where the plot was laid, as Mr. Otley arrived, &s;aying he had been de|layed by Sir Armine, but that there was not a &s;ingle moment to lo&s;e, as the Fitzorton party would be in their carriages, and on their hor&s;es, at &s;ix. "It is now," he ob&s;erved, "on the &s;troke of four, and if we make pro|per u&s;e of our time, &s;hall have the advantage of two hours." "Which will be all we can de&s;ire," &s;aid Miles; "but let us not &s;et out in a body: that will look &s;u&s;picious." After a
<PB N="64" REF="73">few more arrangements, they began their march by the contrary road to that which the Fitzortons were to take; for Otley, having been con&s;ulted on this &s;ubject by his old ma&s;|ter, with whom his advice in all &s;uch matters was looked on as oracular, told his own party how they might avoid a premature rencontre; "as," &s;aid he, "I found no difficulty in per|&s;uading Sir Armine, that the way I wi&s;hed him to go was that he ought to take." In &s;nort, he &s;ettled the geography of the route, and marked the &s;pot at which the attack &s;hould be made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the&s;e tran&s;actions were in pre|paration at the abbey, a con&s;piracy of a very different kind was laid by the ill-&s;tarr'd Charles Stuart, who immediately, on the receipt of the letters that intimated the wedding-day, and the intended particulars of its celebration, fell into a &s;tate &s;o near di&s;traction, that a thou|&s;and plans to prevent the nuptials were form|ed, approved, and renounced almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant. Several of the&s;e, indeed, were
<PB N="65" REF="74">&s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to enter into the brain of any but a man agitated by the extremes of love and of de&s;pair. Rather, however, than &s;uf|fer the hated ceremony betwixt Olivia and Henry to take place, he determined, think|ing, perhaps, with Othello, &s;uch murders would be heavenly, that the death of friend and mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould be crowned by his own. But, to avoid this tragic cata&s;trophe, he re|&s;olved on a project, which, to him, appeared capable of producing the end de&s;ired. The idea of Partington's re&s;olute &s;pirit; his love of doing what men, not daring to act for them|&s;elves, would be afraid to think on; his in|defatigable per&s;everance in whatever he en|gaged; and, amid&s;t all his &s;ingularities, his uncorrupted integrity;&mdash;all the&s;e, forming one grand idea, ru&s;hed upon his fancy &s;o &s;trongly, that without preci&s;ely knowing what good might re&s;ult from it, and feeling that the bad was nearly at the wor&s;t, he a&s;&s;umed a compo&s;ure which lulled even the penetrating Caroline, who now but ill-di&s;gui&s;ed her own &s;orrows. The Lieutenant gave out that he would make a vi&s;it to a brother officer at
<PB N="66" REF="75">&s;ome miles di&s;tance, and try if change of &s;cene, and of company, could not re&s;tore him to that tranquillity which he had lo&s;t. The hou&s;e at which Mr. Partington was then re&s;ident &s;tood at the di&s;tance of a very long day's journey from the abbey, yet, literally travelling on the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion, Charles reached it ju&s;t as Partington was &s;itting down to dinner. The company at table con&s;i&s;ted of the whole family of the Atwoods, at lea&s;t all that part of it which had been taken under Partington's protection&mdash;Jenny being, as the Reader well knows, happily &s;ituated with the Fitzortons.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of a &s;tranger they all ro&s;e; upon which Partington, calling them a &s;et of vile &s;coundrelly good-for-nothing vagabonds, in&s;i&s;ted upon each re&s;itting in the &s;eat, and pulled the Lieutenant down into a chair, at the &s;ame time ordering him to partake of the family fare, and feel him&s;elf as much at home as if he were the &s;on of a friend. "But," &s;aid Partington, "I know how to make di&s;tinc|tions between an infamous ra&s;cal like Charles Stuart, and his all-glorious father, Sir Gui&s;e!"
<PB N="67" REF="76">While Partington made this ob&s;ervation, in his own extraordinary manner, he was heap|ing Charles's plate with what he conceived to be the rarity of the table.</P>
<P>At the name of Stuart, the blood in a tide of the mo&s;t violent crim&s;on covered the coun|tenance of young Atwood; and at the words father Sir Gui&s;e, the youth could hardly conceal or contain an indignation which ro&s;e from his full heart, till a repetition of the Baronet's name quivered on his lips, and died upon his tongue.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t be friends," cried Partington, noticing the young man's emotion. "The Lieutenant here is as great a vagabond as your&s;elf: he has, like me, the highe&s;t re&s;pect for his exalted &s;ire; but I &s;hall think you young&s;ters le&s;s good for nothing than I could wi&s;h, if you do not, like me, know how to make di&s;tinctions." So &s;aying, he put the hand of Charles into that of young Atwood, who would have &s;hrunk back from the &s;lighte&s;t contact with the &s;on of the man who had di&s;honoured his family&mdash;but Partington ex|claimed, "I tell you, &s;tripling, this is as good
<PB N="68" REF="77">for nothing a &s;coundrel as any I know, and therefore you mu&s;t be friends."</P>
<P>Charles, however, made a &s;hew of eating, without reli&s;hing a mor&s;el; and immediately on the cloth being removed, Partington, per|ceiving his di&s;tre&s;s, forcibly led, or rather carried him into another apartment, where Charles, eagerly catching Partington by the hand, exclaimed, "The nuptials of Olivia Clare and Henry Fitzorton are to take place within twenty-four hours. <HI>He loves her not.</HI> It will be a &s;acrifice. <HI>I adore her.</HI> Our de&s;|tiny will be determined. The effect will be dreadful. Sir Armine is not to be per&s;uaded. O! Mr. Partington, is there no &s;tratagem&mdash;no miracle to &s;ave us all? Accumulated will be the horrors that mu&s;t en&s;ue, if this forced alliance takes place. O! pardon the folly, the madne&s;s of this incoherence&mdash;this journey&mdash;the la&s;t effort of a de&s;perate man!&mdash;Farewell! Something terrible is at hand&mdash;for, at the hazard of ten thou&s;and lives, Olivia Clare &s;hall not give her hand to Henry Fitz|orton."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="78">"And when is this forced alliance, as you call it, threatened?" que&s;tioned Partington. "To-morrow begins the accur&s;ed journey, and on the following day my doom is to be &s;ealed. Farewell!"&mdash;"Hold! you head&s;trong vagabond!" &s;aid Partington, detaining him; "let us return to the company&mdash;not an|other word."&mdash;He then hurried back the pa&s;&s;ive Charles into the dining-room, and with yet greater vehemence than he had pre|cipitated him out of it. And ere he had well opened the door he ejaculated, "Avaunt, ye lazy, good-for-nothing devils; here is a world of work to be performed.&mdash;Young man," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Atwood, junior, "your benefactor's favourite child, young Fitzorton, and your &s;i&s;ter's patrone&s;s, demand your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Yet more, you vagabond, <HI>your enemy's &s;on,</HI> but <HI>my friend,</HI> is to be re&s;cued from de&s;pair&mdash;even the &s;on of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart."&mdash;Atwood gave his hand to Charles. "Aye!" &s;aid Partington, "you are the caitiff I thought ye, &s;o take home the&s;e old vagabonds, your father and mother, who would be u&s;ele&s;s lumber in this expedition to
<PB N="70" REF="79">their farm: and if none of us return alive, for dire are our de&s;igns, take care of your&s;elves as well as you can. For you, Charles, mount your hor&s;e:&mdash;no&mdash;fir&s;t write a few lines to Henry, ordering him to be of good cheer&mdash;to &s;mile&mdash;to&mdash;in &s;hort, I will give you final in&s;tructions what is to be &s;aid to the vagabond as &s;oon as I have adju&s;ted a little preliminary with that old &s;coundrel my &s;teward."</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s with Le Maitre, the &s;teward, was to furni&s;h a &s;tout &s;taff and &s;uitable di&s;|gui&s;e for each per&s;on intended to act a part in Partington's drama.</P>
<P>"Di&s;gui&s;es, weapons offen&s;ive and defen|&s;ve, you old vagabond!" were all the orders Le Maitre received: obedient to which, in &s;ome|thing le&s;s than half an hour, Le Maitre had got together &s;uch habiliments and accoutre|ments as would have equipped a pillaging party in the days of Robin Hood. Young Atwood &s;oon returned from the farm attended by two hu&s;bandmen, who, he &s;aid, were to be tru&s;ted. The means of conveyance were ready, a &s;ervant was di&s;patched with the letter to Henry, and on the road were unfolded the
<PB N="71" REF="80">particulars of the enterpri&s;e. The whole groupe, more e&s;pecially young Atwood, who was of an affectionate di&s;po&s;ition, entered into it with ardour and alacrity. "Olivia," &s;aid Partington, "is an abominable &s;coundrel, and mu&s;t be &s;aved even from the man &s;he loves, becau&s;e he does not love her, it &s;eems&mdash;but the ra&s;cal cannot help that. Yet, take notice, Charles, I will prevent forced matches, but I will not be a match-maker: &s;o you and the wench mu&s;t &s;ettle it as well as you can af|terwards&mdash;though I will own to you I &s;hould engage with &s;ome good will in any project that might favour the e&s;cape of a vile ugly young &s;coundrel like your &s;i&s;ter, from &s;uch a noble-minded, brave, generous gentleman as your father! So that when we have, by the plot now rolling in my head, prevented Olivia from running into the arms of Henry, I &s;hall be ready, provided the girl be willing, to aid and abet Henry to run into the arms of Ca|roline; and as for Olivia, get you but the con&s;ent of that little villain, and you &s;hall have mine; and after that, a fig for the oppo&s;ition of fathers and mothers!&mdash;the hand&s;ome ra&s;cal
<PB N="72" REF="81">will be the dearer after &s;he has put you to a good deal of trouble. For my part, I know of but one natural or rea&s;onable impediment to a man's marrying the la&s;s he fancies, and that is, her fancying another; or not fancy|ing him. So now for our expedition&mdash;to relea&s;e a love-&s;ick knight from a dam&s;el who is &s;allying forth to have him whether he will or not!"</P>
<P>In this &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e did Partington and his companions &s;horten their way to Ad&s;ell fore&s;t: what followed their arrival at the ap|pointed place has been circum&s;tantially re|lated from the fir&s;t and &s;econd attack, even to the cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Now, &s;hould the reader, in a retro&s;pect of his own life, be unable to trace any wild pro|ject of love or revenge; if, in a &s;urvey of his antipathies, and of his affections, he &s;hould di&s;cover no ideas conceived, nor &s;chemes exe|cuted, as little &s;en&s;ate as tho&s;e which in&s;ti|gated Sir Gui&s;e to vengeance, Mrs. Tempe&s;t to jealou&s;y, Miles to &s;tudy at once his intere&s;t and revenge, and the traitor David Otley to prefer a golden bribe to the duty he owed
<PB N="73" REF="82">his tru&s;ting ma&s;ter, we <HI>congratulate</HI> him on his exemption from the darker &s;hades in the human character. On the other hand, &s;hould he, in the afore&s;aid examination of him&s;elf, happen upon none of tho&s;e generous exce&s;&s;es in his own feelings which corre&s;pond to the feelings of Partington, nor any which urge him to love Olivia, and to be&s;tow his pity on Henry and Charles; if, moreover, he finds no congenial touch that &s;ends the &s;orrows of Caro|line Stuart thrilling through his blood, nor any glow of approbation at the defeat of villainy, as it was di&s;covered and puni&s;hed at the edge of Ad&s;ell Fore&s;t, we <HI>commi&s;erate</HI> him for that he is incapable of pa&s;&s;ing any manner of judg|ment on the fair, the beautiful, and the good of human nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE night was pa&s;t at the inn with more compo&s;ure than the fatigues of the day, and di&s;a&s;ters of the evening, gave rea&s;on to ex|pect. Even the &s;lumbers of Sir Armine were unbroken till towards the break of day,
<PB N="74" REF="83">when, &s;eeing the &s;till wakeful Henry at his bed-&s;ide, he affectionately &s;aid to him, "I feel in le&s;s particular pain, and am &s;o gene|rally refre&s;hed, that, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall be able, about mid-day, to proceed in our journey. Meantime, my beloved child, you require re&s;t your&s;elf, which I intreat you to take while I make trial to &s;leep again. Ble&s;s you for ever!"</P>
<P>At this moment little Fitz &s;uddenly &s;tarted from his light &s;lumbers, leaped upon the bed in dumb but expre&s;&s;ive eloquence of fond care&s;&s;es&mdash;made with tho&s;e timid advances and mode&s;t tremblings, creeping betwixt hope and fear&mdash;which &s;eemed to purport&mdash;"I am the dog of an enemy, and my humble gratulations may not only be unwelcome, but &s;u&s;pected." This was, a&s;&s;uredly, Sir Armine's idea, if not the dog's, for no &s;ooner did that venerable man perceive the poor little fellow, than, with an encouraging be|nignity, he cried, while he patted the &s;mooth head, and &s;troked the &s;ilken ears&mdash;"I have no quarrel with thee, &s;impleton; and I thank thine hone&s;t love for the&s;e te&s;timonies of thy good
<PB N="75" REF="84">wi&s;hes." Little Fitz li&s;tened to the kind voice, and fondled, in turn, the care&s;&s;ing hand, then gently retired to Henry's lap, where he had pa&s;t the night. Yet &s;uch was the entire love that Henry bore his father, and &s;o wholly was he engro&s;&s;ed by the injuries that good man had received, that he never adverted once to the dog's belonging to his beloved Caroline, till his father's notice of the animal, and the vi&s;ible progre&s;s he made towards recovery, had ea&s;ed his heart of terrors for a life dearer than his own. He now received the dog with a ten|derne&s;s which indicated feelings that attached them&s;elves to the minute&s;t thing living or dead, with which the object of the ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion has, or can, by the magic power of fancy and the heart, be made to connect.</P>
<P>Sir Armine dropt again to &s;leep, and con|tinued to doze till the &s;urgeon came to exa|mine the wounds. Lady Fitzorton, Olivia, Mr. Clare, Jenny Atwood, her brother, and True George&mdash;the latter had, unbidden, kept watch on the out&s;ide his old ma&s;ter's chamber door&mdash;were all ready to overwhelm the &s;ur|geon with que&s;tions on Sir Armine's recovery.
<PB N="76" REF="85">How great then was their wonder! their ec|&s;tacy! to hear this intelligent di&s;ciple of Ae&s;culapius exclaim to the whole a&s;&s;embled party,&mdash;"The patient, methinks, cannot do better than get his breakfa&s;t in bed, about an hour after which, if the &s;un continues his fair promi&s;es, it will be his own fault, or yours, ladies and gentlemen, not Nature's, if he is not again in his carriage, &s;o as to eat his din|ner at the place of your de&s;tination."</P>
<P>The general rapture into which the whole family were thrown by the&s;e tidings, pro|duced the very delays that each individual de&s;ired to avoid. Lady Fitzorton and Olivia, neither of whom had clo&s;ed their eyes through the night, could have embraced the &s;urgeon; the venerable Clare &s;hook his hand heartily; and Henry, emptying his pur&s;e into the &s;ur|geon's not-refu&s;ing palm, leaped about with all the demon&s;trations of an extravagant tran&s;|port, which wholly obliviated the idea, that, with the recovery he &s;o hailed, would end his every hope, and revive his ab&s;olute de&s;pair. Jenny's tender heart dropt tears on her bro|ther's bo&s;om, and ha&s;ted to prepare breakfa&s;t.
<PB N="77" REF="86">But hone&s;t George had always, like Denni&s;on, the art of being extremely happy, and u&s;eful at the &s;ame time; and, with the lightning's &s;peed, he had flown into the kitchen imme|diately on the utterance of the &s;urgeon's hint, that his old ma&s;ter would be in a &s;ituation to travel, if not the fault of him&s;elf or &s;ome one of the family. He re&s;olved, at any rate, the fault, if any, &s;hould not lie with him: though he would have been extremely ready to take the blame of it from any other.</P>
<P>While the&s;e matters were tran&s;acting above in the hou&s;e, Partington and <HI>his</HI> corps were not idle below in the &s;table, where the de|graded Sir Gui&s;e and his a&s;&s;ociates were &s;till under the guard of young Atwood. About midnight, Partington betook him&s;elf to a tru&s;s of clean &s;traw, as nothing could prevail on him to repair to any other bed: he had &s;worn not to quit &s;ight of &s;o honourable a per&s;onage as Sir Gui&s;e Stuart till he had the &s;upreme felicity of &s;eeing him fully com|mitted. He made this ob&s;ervation with a profound bow; and, indeed, through the
<PB N="78" REF="87">whole night treated the Baronet with an ex|ternal re&s;pect, which he would have refu&s;ed to any but one for whom he felt the mo&s;t &s;overeign indignation.</P>
<P>"Be &s;ure, you young, good-for-nothing &s;coundrel," &s;aid he to the worthy Atwood, "that you do not &s;uffer <HI>your</HI> eyes to clo&s;e, &s;hould mine be caught napping; for I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt but that noble, ge|nerous, magnanimous gentleman in the &s;traw"&mdash;three re&s;pectful bows&mdash;"would try to e&s;cape, by which I &s;hould lo&s;e the heartfelt &s;ati&s;|faction I promi&s;e my&s;elf, in &s;eeing him dun|geoned, if not hanged"&mdash;two more bows.</P>
<P>At the end of this &s;arca&s;tic &s;peech Partington cro&s;&s;ed his arms, and ne&s;tling in the &s;traw, &s;oon enjoyed the repo&s;e he courted, and which did not refu&s;e to vi&s;it him in his lowly bed. Atwood gra&s;ped his crab&s;tick, and in manly &s;ilence waved it over the head of the pri&s;oners, not conde&s;cending to &s;peak during the whole night.</P>

<P>BY this time it had gone forth, that the &s;aid pri&s;oners were not actually highwaymen, but wanton a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who had maliciou&s;ly plotted again&s;t the lives of Mr. Clare, Sir Armine Fitzorton, and their families, to gratify their private revenge.</P>
<P>This hint was no &s;ooner &s;pread abroad, than the inhabitants of Ad&s;ell were up in arms; for the whole of that pari&s;h was in the manor&s;hip of Olivia, and almo&s;t every hou&s;e in the village, and mo&s;t of the land that &s;miled around it, was, by virtue of her grand|father's will, the property of that young lady. An e&s;tate of Sir Gui&s;e, or rather of Mrs. Tempe&s;t, lay within the di&s;tance of a few miles in the &s;ame county, &s;o that both parties were well known at Ad&s;ell. In con&s;equence of which, the yard adjoining to the barn wherein Sir Gui&s;e and Co. were depo&s;ited, was crowd|ed by people of both &s;exes, who would have made it unnece&s;&s;ary for young Atwood to &s;tand centinel any longer, as they would cer|tainly have knocked the Baronet and his
<PB N="80" REF="89">illu&s;trious companions on the head, had not Partington di&s;per&s;ed the populace before he betook him&s;elf to re&s;t, and pacified them by an a&s;&s;urance, that they &s;hould have timely no|tice of the execution of the honourable gen|tleman, who, he made no doubt, would &s;uffer to their hearts content, in a very little time.</P>
<P>In this hope they departed to their &s;everal hou&s;es; and it was about the third hour of the morning, when all was quiet in the inn and its environs. But ju&s;t as young Atwood had traver&s;ed the out&s;ide of the barn, the court adjoining, and returned to his &s;tation within,&mdash;it was at this tempting moment, "the very witching time o' th' night," that a whi&s;pering, &s;ucceeded by a &s;oft, fearful tread of per&s;ons, was heard moving towards the barn. A &s;mall lanthern, which one of them held, di&s;covered a man and a woman, the latter led by the former, and each, by turns, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Young Atwood did not doubt but &s;ome kind of treachery was on foot, as the fir&s;t words that reached his ear were touching the liberation of Sir Gui&s;e; he retired, therefore,
<PB N="81" REF="90">a few paces, that he might gain more inform|ation. The per&s;ons advanced, and ob&s;erving the barn door half open, they entered cau|tiou&s;ly; and, after walking on tiptoe a few &s;teps, one of them &s;aid, "All is &s;till; the guard and the guarded are equally overcome by &s;leep&mdash;I have thus far performed my pro|mi&s;e&mdash;you de&s;ired only to &s;ee the vile author of your ruin, and to warn him, that he may leave off his wicked cour&s;es before it be too late. I have con&s;ented to this, becau&s;e it is what a Chri&s;tian &s;hould do; but as for this Sir Gui&s;e, he ought to wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of his own &s;oul, that he &s;hould have time to re|pent, and then be hanged out of the way, for the good of mankind. So, as this is the la&s;t time, I hope, the wicked man can be &s;een on this &s;ide the gallows. Take fa&s;t hold of my hand and follow me, for by the ru&s;tling of the &s;traw we mu&s;t be near the pri&s;oners." Say|ing this, the per&s;on who &s;poke &s;tepped for|ward, holding up the lanthern, by who&s;e light the object he and his companion were in &s;earch of pre&s;ented it&s;elf to view, lying in an abject
<PB N="82" REF="91">po&s;ture, his hands and legs bound, and his a&s;&s;ociates in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Young Atwood receded as the night-walk|ers advanced, de&s;irous to &s;ee the real motive and end of their enterpri&s;e. One of the ad|venturers now held the lanthern to the face of Sir Gui&s;e, the mi&s;erable palene&s;s of which, and every other &s;ign of guilt and fear, cau&s;ed the per&s;on who had not yet &s;poken to ex|claim, in a piteous tone&mdash;"Alas! unhappy man! did I ever think your conduct would bring you to this? and that the woman you have mo&s;t injured &s;hould live to &s;ee it?"&mdash;Then, turning to her companion, &s;he ex|claimed, "Wicked as he is, I cannot bear to &s;ee him in this &s;ad po&s;ture, tied like a crimi|nal, and thrown, as it were, into a dungeon! If," added the &s;peaker, falling on her knees to her companion&mdash;"Oh! if there is any compa&s;&s;ion in your heart; if it has a &s;park of the love you profe&s;s to feel for me, &s;uffer me, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me, to loo&s;e the&s;e cruel cords. I a&s;k no more."&mdash;"Loo&s;e the cords!" returned the other&mdash;"No! were I never to &s;ee you
<PB N="83" REF="92">more, although you are dear to my &s;oul, and I now tell you &s;o all at once, as my heart to my body, I would neither a&s;&s;i&s;t, nor &s;uffer you to give that mon&s;ter liberty of hand or foot. Had I thought Mrs. Jenny could have de&s;ired &s;uch a thing, not all the world&mdash;no, not my love for you, which I feel will be all the world to George, &s;hould have made me &s;hew you the place! What would your good brother &s;ay to this? If poor dear Jerom had his eye on us now, only think how angry he would be!"</P>
<P>At the names Jenny and George, young Atwood ru&s;hed forward, and cried out in a terrible voice, even before he was &s;een, "O wicked! wicked girl! would you &s;et at liberty the wretch who has undone you; who had well nigh brought your poor father and mother with &s;orrow to the grave; and who has almo&s;t murdered your be&s;t friend and benefactor&mdash;for who&s;e &s;ake, and for his other numberle&s;s &s;ins, he is de&s;tined to meet his de&s;erts at la&s;t?&mdash;Yes, vile &s;inner," added he, turning to Sir Gui&s;e, "you will be hanged, you and all your accomplices: but alas! what are your lives, or
<PB N="84" REF="93">the lives of ten thou&s;and thou&s;and &s;uch vil|lains, to the finger-ache of &s;uch a noble gen|tleman as Sir Armine Fitzorton; or the in|nocence of this poor, wicked, unhappy girl, whom you have ruined, and who is &s;till &s;inful enough to wi&s;h you were free? As for you, George," continued he, "I am not angry with&mdash;;I know your love for my &s;i&s;ter, and am &s;orry for you. I know you would have died &s;ooner than con&s;ent to let him e&s;cape; and you only came here with the girl, out of pure good will, becau&s;e &s;he pretended &s;he wanted to rebuke her &s;educer. Rebuke him! why, you could not &s;ay an angry word to him; you know you could not, Jenny. Surely the girls are di&s;tracted mad, George! they love the &s;coundrels who undo them better than the men who would &s;ooner lo&s;e their lives than do them a wrong!"</P>
<P>The poor Jane, overwhelmed with her agi|tations, at being thus in the pre&s;ence of her brother, lover, and betrayer, could &s;carcely &s;tand under the &s;upport of the two former&mdash;"Would to God I were dead!" &s;aid &s;he: "but you wrong me, brother; I did not
<PB N="85" REF="94">mean to make Mr. George guilty of ingrati|tude to his ma&s;ter by relea&s;ing Sir Gui&s;e, I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;only wi&s;hed him not to be&mdash;be&mdash;bound in that manner."&mdash;Here her tears choaked her utterance, and &s;he wept aloud.</P>
<P>Her &s;orrows awakened Partington, who no &s;ooner heard the &s;tory from the hone&s;t lips of George, than he called Jenny a good-for-no|thing little vagabond, &s;haking her mo&s;t kindly by the hand all the time, and de&s;ired George and Jerom to lead her back to the hou&s;e, commanding them to &s;ay nothing of her ad|venture to any of the Fitzortons, and in&s;i&s;t|ing the pretty young &s;coundrel &s;hould no more be &s;colded.&mdash;"Scolded, your honour!" re|plied George; "I would not let her own brother, nor even your honour &s;cold her, if I could help it, without knocking out both your brains; only I thought"&mdash;"The thought of knocking out our brains is good, and might in that ca&s;e be ju&s;tifiable, perhaps," cries Partington; "but thinking is lo&s;s of time, you ra&s;cal.&mdash;Here, both of you give her a ki&s;s, and do as I ordered, while I relieve guard over this all-worthy gentleman"&mdash;
<PB N="86" REF="95">a profound bow to Sir Gui&s;e&mdash;"and his two veteran a&s;&s;ociates,"&mdash;a bow to each, till his head almo&s;t touched the &s;traw.</P>
<P>Jenny went away &s;omewhat pacified, but could not help ca&s;ting more than one look behind. For though, perhaps, even Parting|ton did not more thoroughly de&s;pi&s;e the ac|tions of the Baronet, nor more execrate his principles, than did this virtuou&s;ly-di&s;po&s;ed young woman&mdash;&s;he felt for him involuntary emotions of pity and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The good Partington &s;aw this midnight enterpri&s;e, as, in truth, he did mo&s;t other things, in the proper light; and his know|ledge of the human heart joined the pity he felt in his own, to determine it was a matter to be hu&s;hed up. On the return, therefore, of the young men, he took each of them by the hand and de&s;ired them to be of good cheer, &s;ince they had every rea&s;on to believe that "when that amiable gentleman"&mdash;a pro|found reverence to Sir Gui&s;e&mdash;"had hung his hour, the grand enemy to the girl's peace of mind would be removed; and he did not doubt but he &s;hould &s;ee Jenny as good-for-nothing
<PB N="87" REF="96">a &s;i&s;ter to Jerom, and as infamous a wife to George, as any happy little varlet could de&s;ire to be."</P>
<P>This inverted mode of compliment being well under&s;tood, the youths were made again comfortable, and the whole affair ended by Jerom's taking George by the hand, &s;aying, "If &s;o be things went that way, there was not a man in the world he would &s;o &s;oon wi&s;h to call his brother, provided the affair with that vile mon&s;ter could be put up with&mdash;but, for his part, he would not marry a duche&s;s, no, not the queen's maje&s;ty her&s;elf, if he knew &s;he had been mi&s;s to another man, though it were a king on his throne."&mdash;"Jerom, Je|rom! you talk like a hector and a fool!" &s;aid Partington.&mdash;"He talks," &s;aid George, "a'nt plea&s;e your honour, like a young fellow who has never been in love; true love forgives every thing that happens before wedlock, and mo&s;t things that happen after. And as to Jenny, I think her the mode&s;te&s;t girl in the whole world, and I love her the be&s;t, though I never told her &s;o till to-day; and when Sir Gui&s;e is dead, I think all will be well between Jenny
<PB N="88" REF="97">and me; though I had rather he &s;hould live fifty years, and keep me out of Jenny's heart for ever, than that any harm &s;hould betide my dear good old ma&s;ter, or any of my honoured young ones, or any of the family, not forget|ting Mr. and Mi&s;s Clare."</P>
<P>"George," &s;aid Partington, affecting to cough, "you are one of the mo&s;t un&s;upport|able young ra&s;cals I ever knew&mdash;give me your hand. But take this for your comfort; whether Sir Armine lives or dies, Atwood's &s;i&s;ter &s;hall be your wife, and this right-worthy old youth"&mdash;another bow&mdash;"&s;hall &s;wing with both his excellent friends, becau&s;e it would be a &s;in to part them."&mdash;Here he rolled the Ba|ronet and his a&s;&s;ociates about, and heaped the &s;traw over them as if they were &s;o many pigs.</P>

<P>THE provi&s;ions which the youth or|dered to be brought into the barn were now re&s;orted to, and the exulting trio &s;at down to the repa&s;t, &s;pread upon a winnowing machine,
<PB N="89" REF="98">turned the wrong &s;ide, with as high &s;pirits, and as hearty an appetite, as they ever en|joyed; particularly as one of the waiters en|tered with a billet to Partington, containing the following words:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Ba&s;il Partington, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>My poor father is in a &s;ound repo&s;e.&mdash;Reque&s;t my unhappy friend Charles to come to the bed which is prepared for him; and do you, dear Sir, take quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of yours. I cannot quit my po&s;t, but hope to relate good tidings in the morning.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Partington having read this note, and fold|ed it up, he handed it about, fir&s;t penciling on the back of it the&s;e words&mdash;"Read, but let not the worthy Sir Gui&s;e &s;u&s;pect it brings any good news."&mdash;He gave it to George, who opened it, and &s;carcely able to conceal his joy, put it in the hands of Jerom.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;erable intelligence!" &s;aid Partington, with great gravity:&mdash;"No hopes you &s;ee;&mdash;
<PB N="90" REF="99">the &s;urgeon, no doubt, gives it up as a lo&s;t ca&s;e.&mdash;Heigho!&mdash;let us rai&s;e our &s;pirits with a gla&s;s of that wine. Fill, George.

<P>"It would be a compliment, gentlemen, to offer you any refre&s;hment; indeed, &s;eeing you have &s;o &s;hort time to live, it would be throw|ing good things away upon almo&s;t dead car|ca&s;es; and I hate to be extravagant:&mdash;&s;o, wi&s;h|ing, with all our &s;ouls, that the hangman may do ju&s;tice to all three of you, we have the honour to drink your good health in all Chri&s;tian charity!"</P>
<P>The bitter &s;arca&s;m of tone, ge&s;ture, and action, which characteri&s;ed the &s;corn of Par|tington, cannot be conveyed in language.</P>
<P>The bottle was emptied, and the repa&s;t fini&s;hed, in the like &s;pirit of biting ridicule, which often extorted an oath from the daring

<P>One of the waiters now brought a letter into the barn, &s;aying, it came by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, who was then waiting a reply in the kitchen. It contained what follows:</P>

<P>Forgive my having deceived you. In|&s;tead of retiring to my bed, the pretence with which I left you, I fled from the mo&s;t horrid of all human &s;ights&mdash;the pre&s;ence of a father who hath made his &s;on cur&s;e the hour of his own birth, and wi&s;h for death to cover his &s;hame. But how &s;hall I e&s;cape my&s;elf? And, alas! my poor &s;i&s;ter! how &s;hall I &s;helter thee from the di&s;grace which is thus brought upon thee? If Henry can endure my hated name, tell him I &s;hall feel horrors not to be borne till I know the &s;tate of his injured pa|rent. I have other griefs &s;ettling in my &s;oul, but may not give them vent. As for him&mdash;the atrocious! the unnatural!&mdash;I yield him to con&s;cience and ju&s;tice;&mdash;and yet, alas! he is

</LETTER>
<P>In the progre&s;s of peru&s;ing this letter, the colours of compa&s;&s;ion and indignation alter|nately mounted, and &s;ometimes mixed in Par|tington's cheek. The&s;e were &s;ucceeded by tears that gu&s;hed from his eyes, and that al|mo&s;t to the drowning of his voice. "In&s;uffer|able young villain!" &s;aid he, "this is not to be endured!"&mdash;Then darting a look of rage and contempt&mdash;which no features could more for|cibly expre&s;s than Partington's, &s;harpened by that ironical a&s;perity which was edged at every word and intonation with the mo&s;t cut|ting energies&mdash;"Here," cried Partington, "li&s;ten to the &s;entiments of that &s;coundrel of a &s;on who has run away from his amiable &s;ire in his la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and left him in confine|ment in his way to an ignominious death."&mdash;He then read the letter aloud, &s;inking only
<PB N="93" REF="102">the la&s;t &s;entence, mentioning Sir Gui&s;e's being &s;uffered to e&s;cape; thundering in the ear of Sir Gui&s;e every expre&s;&s;ion that manife&s;ted the deep &s;en&s;e which Charles had of his father's villainy. And at the end, &s;eeing him un|moved, or, if moved, only from the impul&s;es of fear, "Behold," &s;aid Partington, "how the good Baronet's tender heart bleeds at the wounds which his ungracious boy has inflicted! What &s;en&s;ibility! What affliction! What exqui|&s;ite feeling! Hone&s;t, con&s;cientious gentleman! He will hardly &s;urvive &s;o unfilial an attack. It will go with him to the gallows!"</P>
<P>The reverences which Partington made, during this addre&s;s, were repeated at every &s;entence, till, at la&s;t, they arrived at almo&s;t Per&s;ian pro&s;tration. Then, de&s;iring the Ba|ronet and his two friends would be kind enough to ri&s;e from the &s;traw, and hold them|&s;elves in readine&s;s to be tried, condemned, and executed, he left them in the charge of young Atwood, ordering True George to follow him into the hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE good Partington, to the infinite joy of his hone&s;t heart, found the Fitzorton family &s;till rejoicing at the unexpectedly rapid recovery of Sir Armine. Olivia had ju&s;t prepared for him the third cup of tea, and was going to place it on a waiter to be con|veyed by a &s;ervant, when this &s;ingular man &s;natched it from her hand, declaring, "&s;he was an infamous little villain to &s;uppo&s;e any other per&s;on &s;hould carry it the old ra&s;cal but him|&s;elf, when he was within reach of him."</P>
<P>"That trouble is unnece&s;&s;ary," &s;aid Lady Fitzorton; "Sir Armine feels him&s;elf quite &s;tout enough to fini&s;h his breakfa&s;t be|low; and that you, Olivia, may be out of pain as completely as our&s;elves, your good father gently turned me out of his apartment ju&s;t now, &s;aying, he would be my &s;ub&s;titute. Hark! I hear them coming." The door was opened, and di&s;covered the truly reverend and honourable Sir Armine walking into the room with a not infirm &s;tep, and rather affec|tionately embracing, than leaning upon his
<PB N="95" REF="104">friendly &s;upporters, Henry and Mr. Clare. "There," &s;aid the old gentleman, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his attendants by &s;preading his arms to their extent, "Armine's him&s;elf again!" Then taking every one by the hand, he acknow|ledged their tender care, a&s;&s;uring them of his freedom from pain, except a kind of confu&s;ion in his head from the &s;evere blow he had there been &s;aluted with, probably by the hand of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart.</P>
<P>"No doubt!" exclaimed Partington, "your obligations to that very worthy gentleman are &s;o great, that I hope you will have no objec|tion to attend him and his brace of myrmidons to the Ju&s;tice, who, I find, re&s;ides three miles on our road to Ad&s;ell Hall, &s;carcely a fur|long out of your way,&mdash;though, I tru&s;t, you have enough of Chri&s;tian &s;pirit in that old abominable body to travel to a court of equity as far as the Alps, in order to do your coun|try the &s;ervice of committing &s;o very de|&s;erving and amiable a per&s;onage to the halter. Indeed, as you are al&s;o in the commi&s;&s;ion, I do not &s;ee why you &s;hould not pa&s;s &s;entence on the gentleman your&s;elf:&mdash;but, perhaps, you may think it right to pay your brother ju&s;tice
<PB N="96" REF="105">the compliment of hanging an hone&s;t man found in his di&s;trict. I expect, at any rate, that you will be well enough to &s;ee him &s;wing; for, although you have given the death de&s;igned for you the &s;lip, there is, I think, malice prepen&s;e enough in the attack to hang the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and, to tell you the truth, if I did not think &s;o, I &s;hould &s;carcely forgive you for recovering;&mdash;and if you are of a different opinion, I mu&s;t really beg the favour of you to die off as fa&s;t as you can, that ju&s;tice may be &s;atisfied.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e," added he, "you know that the worthy trio are under my cu&s;tody, and re|fre&s;hing them&s;elves at this moment in an un|roofed barn, with &s;ome unpeppered, un&s;alted, and unbuttered water-gruel, ready to march at the word of command."</P>
<P>All the time Partington was &s;peaking, poor Jane Atwood then happening to be in the room and behind Olivia's chair, was obliged to hold it fa&s;t to &s;upport her&s;elf from falling. Henry, from contrary cau&s;es, but productive of the &s;ame effects, was in a &s;carce better con|dition. They were all, however, &s;oon relieved by Sir Armine, who, taking a paper from his
<PB N="97" REF="106">pocket, at the &s;ight of which Olivia's cheeks took the hue of the deepe&s;t crim&s;on, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed his friends:&mdash;"I will read a paper of propo&s;als to you, my friends, and mu&s;t own it has wholly decided me as to what &s;hould be done with the pri&s;oners. I need not inform you that it was drawn up by that blu&s;hing little girl of ours, and, as I believe, placed by Lady Fitzorton upon my pillow."</P>
<P>"Why, what wickedne&s;s has the little ra&s;|cal been at now?" quoth Partington.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall hear," replied Sir Armine; and then putting the paper into Lady Fitzorton's hand, de&s;ired her to read it for the good of the company, which, while Olivia &s;at between the palpitating Henry and Mr. Clare, &s;he did as follows:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Armine Fitzorton, Bart.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearly valued friend, and almo&s;t father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>But that the news, the heartfelt news, of your being recovered;&mdash;but that the a&s;&s;u|rances of my &s;oul-elected Henry, promi&s;e us the &s;ight of you in a few hours; I &s;hould neither have the will nor the power to write
<PB N="98" REF="107">to you on the propo&s;ed &s;ubject of this paper, which is in behalf of your bittere&s;t enemy! not for his own &s;ake, you will readily believe, but as his public di&s;grace mu&s;t, inevitably, be connected with the public character and pri|vate feelings of far more worthy per&s;ons."</P>
<P>"There's a little villain for you," &s;aid Par|tington, drawing the back of his hand acro&s;s his eyes.&mdash;Lady Fitzorton went on:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Had any thing fatal happened from the mercile&s;s being for whom I now plead, Heaven only knows how any of tho&s;e per&s;ons would have borne the blow! Surely, it would have broken all our hearts."</P>
<P>"Dear angelic girl!" cried old Clare, pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om&mdash;"were any thing to break thine, the &s;trings of mine would crack, I'm &s;ure!"&mdash;Lady Fitzorton proceed|ed:&mdash;</P>
<P>"But, as it has plea&s;ed the great Re&s;torer, in pity and in love, to give you to us, certain I am, that the only re&s;entment your all-noble nature is capable of feeling again&s;t the cruel author of your &s;ufferings, will be confined to him&s;elf alone, and no way extend to the in|nocent,
<PB N="99" REF="108">becau&s;e they happen to be his off|&s;pring."</P>
<P>"Sweet Olivia!" &s;aid Lady Fitzorton, taking one of her hands.</P>
<P>She is <HI>my</HI> child! my own dear daughter!" cried Mr. Clare, proudly. "Think of that!" eagerly &s;natching the other hand&mdash;"Thanks be to God that gave her to me:&mdash;&s;he is <HI>my</HI> daughter!"</P>
<P>"Go on with the letter," &s;aid Sir Armine, coughing to conceal his emotions.</P>
<P>"On this principle I dare to &s;ue even for Sir Gui&s;e Stuart;&mdash;&s;ince the &s;hame and &s;or|row of his children,&mdash;the excellent Caroline, and her amiable brother,&mdash;would be doubly heaped upon them. Were you to carry even your ju&s;t vengeance again&s;t this mi&s;guided man, I tremble for the effect of a public pro|&s;ecution on <HI>their</HI> minds."</P>
<P>"Good and gracious Heaven!" ejaculated Henry; "is it po&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Ah! permit me, deare&s;t Sir Armine, to place my&s;elf in their &s;ituation while I plead their cau&s;e. I feel, that the reflected infamy of Him who gave <HI>me</HI> being would kill me!"</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="109">"My child! thy father &s;hall never di&s;ho|nour thee," &s;aid Mr. Clare, the proude&s;t chords of his heart finely touched,&mdash;"never! never!"</P>

<P>"He mu&s;t be more than human that can," cried Henry.</P>
<P>"As I am neither more or le&s;s than human, I'll hear no more of the vile hu&s;&s;ey's non&s;en&s;e, unle&s;s the letter is read on without &s;toppings," &s;aid Partington, blowing his no&s;e violently.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>When Lady Fitzorton was preparing to read, Olivia would have quitted the room,
<PB N="102" REF="111">and &s;tarting up, had got to the door; but Partington caught hold of her and exclaimed, "Stop! you in&s;ufferable &s;coundrel! &s;top!&mdash;I knew you had done &s;omething to be a&s;hamed of, but there's no e&s;caping. I am an excel|lent hand to catch a thief, and to keep him too:&mdash;witne&s;s Sir Gui&s;e and Co.!"</P>
<P>For &s;ome time Henry had manife&s;ted emo|tions almo&s;t beyond his nature to endure. Genero&s;ity, goodne&s;s, compa&s;&s;ion, and every other quality that exalts Humanity, in tho&s;e happy moments, when every principle is alive, and every pa&s;&s;ion moving to virtuous impul&s;e, reflected from the conduct of Olivia, &s;truck on his heart, well fitted to receive &s;uch di&s;tin|gui&s;hed gue&s;ts; at length, dropping on his knees, "O teach me!" he exclaimed, "teach me how I can de&s;erve &s;uch excellence?"</P>
<P>Olivia, who had not till that moment rai&s;ed her head, which alternately repo&s;ed on her father's and Henry's arm, as the proper &s;up|ports of her blooming merit, now ventured to look up, &s;ummoned by a voice to her <HI>indeed</HI> "&s;weet as the &s;hepherd's pipe upon the moun|tains," and tenderly returning the embrace
<PB N="103" REF="112">of her Enthu&s;ia&s;t, &s;he declared, "that although the whole company had, out of all bounds, over-rated common &s;entiments of Chri&s;tian charity, &s;he felt her&s;elf rejoiced not to have offended; and if there was any merit, it was all borrowed from con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation with tho&s;e who&s;e conduct was at once her emu|lation and her example."</P>
<P>"Then, I &s;uppo&s;e, the worthy Baronet is not to be hanged this time?" &s;aid Parting|ton.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Sir Armine; "I think I &s;ee my&s;elf &s;o well, and &s;o &s;atisfied, that I &s;hal take Olivia's advice."</P>
<P>"Why, for that matter," rejoined Parting|ton, "I mu&s;t own, I too have a letter to be read which &s;eems to &s;trengthen an idea of that &s;ort; and as I plainly perceive my vote to break the hone&s;t man's neck will pa&s;s for nothing, where a pack of abominable good-for-nothing &s;coundrels are re&s;olved to &s;ave him,&mdash;here, Henry, do you give us the con|tents of this:"&mdash;pre&s;enting him with that letter from Charles which was before offered to the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="113">It was with great labour that Henry, after many &s;tops, lets, and hindrances, from the overflowings of his own heart and that of the company, fini&s;hed this epi&s;tle. All the pa&s;|&s;ions of his nature had been up in arms for a con&s;iderable time. In this la&s;t letter, there were &s;ome hard lines which pierced him, and him only of the party, to the quick.&mdash;The forlorn &s;ituation of Caroline, wondering, per|haps, at the ab&s;ence of her father; the tender goodne&s;s of Olivia, the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of Sir Armine, and the dire heart-rending condition of his friend Charles, formed, in his bo&s;om, &s;uch a ma&s;s of contrary and conflicting pa&s;&s;ions and principles, de&s;ires and duties, hopes and fears, that Henry Fitzorton's &s;itua|tion at this cri&s;is was, perhaps, as truly to be commi&s;erated as at any period, not of his individual, but of the human hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"Do you, Henry," &s;aid Sir Armine, "for I know you will do it in the be&s;t manner, an|&s;wer your friend's letter&mdash;Partington will only interlard it with vagabonds and &s;coundrels.&mdash;No&mdash;it will be better, dear boy, in your hands:&mdash;You will a&s;&s;ure your friend of my
<PB N="105" REF="114">continued e&s;teem for <HI>him;</HI> and that while you are telling him &s;o, his father will be &s;et at liberty."</P>
<P>Jane Atwood here quitted the room very ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"And add, my Henry," cried Sir Armine, "that it &s;hall be by no fault of mine, or my family, or my friends, if the cruel and unpro|voked a&s;&s;ault is ever divulged to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;his&mdash;to Mi&s;s&mdash;"</P>
<P>Sir Armine he&s;itated, &s;eeing &s;ome paper which had lain on the table tremble in Henry's hand, to pronounce the name of Caroline or Stuart. He therefore only added, in an un|der tone, heard only by Henry&mdash;"you know who I mean, Henry."</P>
<P>"And while Harry is thus employed, you, my dear Sir Armine," ob&s;erved Lady Fitz|orton, "you may go with me, if you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>They did &s;o, and while they were ab&s;ent, Partington, being now left alone with Henry, exclaimed, "What, you vagabond! is to be done now? Our plan, you &s;ee, has been over|turned, and there is no time for another. You cannot be carried off again. This forced
<PB N="106" REF="115">match, I fear, after all, mu&s;t take place: yet who, but &s;uch a fellow as you, would re|quire <HI>force</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a darling little vil|lain as Olivia? What do you intend?"</P>
<P>"Would I were dead, and buried!" ejacu|lated Henry, "or would I had never &s;een!&mdash;Indulge me, dear Mr. Partington, by leaving me alone a little. I will endeavour to do what I ought&mdash;what is right. Order the car|riages as de&s;ired.&mdash;Some delay will, of cour&s;e, happen after this accident&mdash;at lea&s;t, one day! and if I gain another day, I &s;hall have time to think and to decide."</P>
<P>Partington, who, amid&s;t all his &s;ingularities, was never trouble&s;ome, and who, indeed, knew not how to advi&s;e Henry, whom he &s;incerely loved, left the room, &s;aying only, with vi&s;ible &s;igns of anxiety&mdash;"All I know of a certainty is, that you are one of the mo&s;t atrocious young &s;coundrels I ever &s;aw; and, therefore, I wi&s;h with all my &s;oul I could &s;ee you happy, without &s;eeing others who are as great vagabonds as your&s;elf mi|&s;erable."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE letter which Henry, after he had recovered him&s;elf, wrote to Charles, contained all the generous &s;entiments his father dictated, with every grace they could receive from elo|quent expre&s;&s;ion; but they were mingled with others that betrayed a di&s;ordered and almo&s;t di&s;tracted mind, but which would become in|telligible to Charles, in addition to his father's kind commands. He told his friend, that nothing but rocks and precipices were before him; that all the powers of gratitude, duty, love, friend&s;hip, honour, pity, hope, and de&s;|pair, were at once warring in his brea&s;t; that whichever way he moved, &s;ome of the&s;e were his con&s;tant attendants in oppo&s;ition to each other, with regard to his power of reconciling them with his peace, and agreed only in one de|termined point&mdash;a general confederacy again&s;t his happine&s;s; for that even Hope her&s;elf, which, in any other man's &s;ituation, would bring heal|ing on her wings, &s;eemed to make her vi&s;its of a moment to <HI>him,</HI> only to &s;hew his &s;tate was &s;o forlorn, &s;o de&s;titute, there was no re&s;t|ing-place
<PB N="108" REF="117">whereon &s;he could &s;et her foot; and that &s;he was compelled to leave him to De&s;pair.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear! dear friend! and partner in grief!" ob&s;erved the unhappy Henry, "the firebrands of hate and animo&s;ity, which our af|fectionate care, joined to the goodne&s;s of Sir Armine's heart, had almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, are by this baneful rencontre and its effects kin|dled afre&s;h, and mu&s;t con&s;ume you and your beloved Olivia, Henry and his adored Caro|line in a&s;hes."</P>
<P>He then implored the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Charles, without the &s;lighte&s;t expectation that either could be availing! He ran on to &s;ome length in a &s;tate of incoherence that en|tangled the de&s;ign, and ob&s;cured the &s;en&s;e with which he began; and, in fine, di&s;covered that his enthu&s;ia&s;m threatened to hurl Rea&s;on from her throne! He then recurred to that la&s;t dire refuge of the de&s;perate, and argued the point of life and death by his own hand, with a ca&s;ui&s;try &s;o &s;ubtle that he had almo&s;t per&s;uaded him&s;elf &s;uicide was the only virtue left him to perform.&mdash;"This way only," &s;aid he, "can Olivia e&s;cape a man, who&s;e heart
<PB N="109" REF="118">is for ever alienated&mdash;for ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by another! This way alone can my friend avoid the mi&s;ery of &s;eeing the woman he adores in the arms of another.&mdash;This way, too, &s;hall he be di&s;&s;olved from his everla&s;ting oath, and die faithful to the vows of his heart."</P>
<P>After a long indulgence of this phrenzy, he took the path which led to the contrary extreme, where duty to his father, and ad|miration of the tender virtues, as well as ten|der pity for the affection of Olivia, convinced him, though his days were to exceed tho&s;e of the longe&s;t liver upon earth, he ought &s;till to wi&s;h their prolongation, that he might reward &s;o much benevolence, beauty, and goodne&s;s. He concluded the epi&s;tle by confe&s;&s;ing, his whole &s;oul was in the &s;tate of this globe of earth, when all its materials were di&s;cordant atoms, and not having &s;uffered his pa&s;&s;ions or his imagination, intemperate as they were, to extingui&s;h, for more than a moment, tho&s;e heavenly &s;parks which his principles had lighted up, and which his education had fo&s;|tered in his &s;oul, he ended with a prayer, that the Power who called into order a world, and
<PB N="110" REF="119">perhaps myriads of worlds, from anarchy, would deign to bring his deeply-di&s;tracted mind from its pre&s;ent chaos!</P>
<P>The unfortunate writer of this farrago hav|ing addre&s;&s;ed, &s;ealed, and di&s;patched it, felt an impul&s;e, he could not but indulge, to join the party now a&s;&s;embled in the barn. He there found Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton, Olivia and Mr. Clare, who had been inter|rupted in their way thereto by a little adven|ture of Jane Atwood's.</P>
<P>The reader may recollect the latter of the&s;e per&s;ons left the room &s;uddenly, the occa&s;ion of which was this:&mdash;Finding, through the benevolence of Olivia and Sir Armine, that her &s;till too kindly-remembered Sir Gui&s;e would receive no farther hard&s;hips, and conjecturing &s;he &s;hould incur no cen&s;ure by a little antici|pation of the intended clemency, the poor girl, obeying the &s;oftne&s;s of her heart, which told her, that Nature in&s;i&s;ted on her dues of daily bread, as well in her guilty as inno|cent &s;ubjects, had ventured to gain one of the waiters over to her wi&s;hes of admini&s;tering &s;omething to eat and drink more nutritious
<PB N="111" REF="120">than the bread and water which that vigilant di&s;ciplinarian, Mr. Partington, had permitted to be &s;et before them &s;ince their captivity. Having &s;een her brother, therefore, &s;afe at his own breakfa&s;t, and True George, who&s;e heart, on this &s;ide a breach of duty, could deny her nothing, fixed as his &s;ub&s;titute, &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t centinel, namely the afore&s;aid George, and had got with her ba&s;ket of provi&s;ions to the barn door, and was ju&s;t giving orders to the waiter to take it to the pri&s;oners, when Sir Armine and the re&s;t caught her in the fact.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conjecture the ingenuous di&s;tre&s;s and embarra&s;&s;ment of Jane Atwood. She entered upon her defence in &s;o very lame a manner, that her offence would have been extremely aggravated had &s;he not found a better advocate in Olivia, who, with hone&s;t energy, declared, &s;he &s;hould have done the &s;ame, or wor&s;e, had &s;he reflected on the cir|cum&s;tances of the poor wretches; "for I do not think," &s;aid &s;he, "I could know the wickede&s;t creature upon the earth; no, not my father's murderer&mdash;though the very thought of
<PB N="112" REF="121">him would nearly murder me too&mdash;no; I am po&s;itive I could not let even him die of fa|mine while I had charge of his life, and power to admini&s;ter to tho&s;e bitter wants which would make him incapable even of repent|ance in his la&s;t moments."</P>
<P>"Take that ba&s;ket, George," &s;aid Sir Armine, "and carry it to the party who are in need of its contents&mdash;or no&mdash;&s;top," conti|nued he, "I have a thought may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e better.&mdash;Here, Jane, do you carry this into the hou&s;e, and in a room apart from that which we occupy, order a proper repa&s;t to be prepared for the per&s;ons you intended to relieve; and &s;ee, good girl, that it be done immediately."</P>
<P>Jane, bur&s;ting into tears, could an&s;wer to this kindne&s;s only by them, and &s;everal bows which George made for her, &s;aying, "Their honours &s;aw the young woman was not well." George then took hold of her arm, and conducted her into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It was at this moment that Henry arrived. Sir Armine undertook the explanation &s;o much to Olivia's honour, that Henry, ince&s;|&s;antly
<PB N="113" REF="122">warmed by in&s;tances of her excellent di&s;po&s;ition, felt it was, if not the conquering, the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s moment, and with violence prote&s;ted he was &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t be an angel. "No," replied Olivia, putting her face clo&s;e to that of Henry; "alas! no angel, but a mere mortal, who con&s;iders that the poor wretch, bad as he is, gave birth to Charles and Caroline, of who&s;e ine&s;timable value we are both con&s;cious."</P>
<P>Thus perpetually did Olivia promote the cau&s;e of others, and counteract her deare&s;t intere&s;ts! At the di&s;plays of her character and conduct, Henry often glowed with &s;uch admiration and gratitude, that he could have been proud to have flown with her to the al|tar; but then her conver&s;ation &s;o frequently brought back the image and virtues of Caro|line to his mind, that &s;he was, in a manner, acce&s;&s;ary to his looking on that altar as the place where, &s;hould he yield his hand to Oli|via, he mu&s;t at the &s;ame time &s;acrifice his love, his fame, his friend, his honour, and his virtue!</P>

<P>SIR ARMINE, with his family, now en|tered the place where the proud, cre&s;t-fallen Sir Gui&s;e, and his infamous accomplices, were degraded; and, advancing within a few paces, &s;topped &s;hort.</P>
<P>For a moment we too mu&s;t pau&s;e, good reader, to conver&s;e in a friendly manner with one another. Peradventure thou ha&s;t formed great expectations of this meeting of the two Baronets: thou maye&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the in|jured Sir Armine, after much triumph over the captive Sir Gui&s;e, will di&s;mi&s;s him with all the pride of a conqueror. If thou art of a &s;anguine complexion, thou wilt prepare for the grand &s;ublime of &s;ome great action, ac|companied by all its verbal pageantries; and if of a phlegmatic turn, thou wilt be di&s;&s;atisfied if any thing be &s;aid or done beyond the barren limit of thy own cold nature. Either way, if thou art deeply read in fa&s;tidious learning, thou wilt be di&s;appointed in this tran&s;action, which con&s;i&s;ted&mdash;after a moment's delay to beg Lady
<PB N="115" REF="124">Fitzorton and Olivia would apprehend nothing&mdash;in the offended party going up to the grand offender, and with his own hand unbinding his legs and arms, beckoning to George and his &s;on Henry to do the &s;ame for Miles and David Otley.</P>
<P>The contra&s;t exhibited in the two Baronets at this in&s;tant was &s;uch, as a delineator of the human character has &s;eldom an opportunity to ob&s;erve. The awful and &s;uperior maje&s;ty of an in&s;ulted and innocent man giving liberty to a ba&s;e clande&s;tine enemy, who, though nearly dead to the exce&s;&s;es of con&s;cious infamy, &s;eemed almo&s;t to wi&s;h that the cords thus loo&s;ened were drawn tight, even to &s;trangu|lation, round his neck.</P>
<P>Sir Armine pointed to the door, and &s;igni|fied, by &s;ufficient tokens, that the path to the Abbey, or wherever el&s;e he might de&s;ire to take his way, would not be ob&s;tructed: but Sir Armine uttered not a word till he gained the court-yard, that led from the barn to the hou&s;e, and then, in a voice that penetrated the heart of every hearer, he &s;aid&mdash;"Attri|bute, thou Implacable! thy unde&s;erved en|largement
<PB N="116" REF="125">to thy children and mine, who&s;e virtues are a balance&mdash;and &s;urely higher prai&s;e cannot be given them&mdash;for vices &s;uch as thine!"</P>
<P>Di&s;daining to ca&s;t a look on the &s;ubordi|nate engines of ba&s;ene&s;s, Sir Armine, with his a&s;&s;ociates, went into the hou&s;e, but he had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed his foot over the thre&s;hold be|fore Jane Atwood and True George came running into the pa&s;&s;age, by another door, to &s;ay, that "an armed multitude were marching on from the neighbouring villages to revenge the injuries committed again&s;t their re&s;pected patron, Sir Armine, by their dete&s;ted tyrant Sir Gui&s;e."</P>
<P>"He mu&s;t be protected," &s;aid Sir Armine. George flew to his protection &s;wift as the word. Young Atwood, who was at hand, did the &s;ame. His &s;i&s;ter repeated Sir Ar|mine's orders till Ad&s;ell woods re-echoed&mdash;"Sir Gui&s;e mu&s;t be protected." Henry Fitzorton for&s;ook, for a moment, the &s;ide of Olivia to attempt the re&s;cue of the father of Caroline. But the mob, who now poured into the inn-yard, covering the
<PB N="117" REF="126">fields adjacent, were at fir&s;t too clamorous to be oppo&s;ed&mdash;they had heard the &s;tory of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination with all the extravagant addi|tions of a travelling tale; and here, as at the abbey and ca&s;tle, Sir Gui&s;e being an object of general hatred, and Sir Armine of as ge|neral love, even the entreaties, explanations, promi&s;es, and threats of the latter, could not prevent the enraged multitude from hooting, pelting, hi&s;&s;ing, hu&s;tling, buffeting, and beating the former out of the inn|yard; and in de&s;pite of Henry, Partington, young Atwood, George and Jane, who fol|lowed the rabble from one end of the pa|ri&s;h to the other, their unmitigated fury was pur&s;ued by the a&s;&s;ailants even to that part of Ad&s;ell fore&s;t where the po&s;tillion told them the attack was made. At that memorable place, had not the &s;hrieks and at length the &s;woons of Jane Atwood, like a guardian genius, broke the raging pa&s;&s;ions, by exciting the general pity and humanity of the mob to re&s;tore a beautiful young wo|man whom &s;ome of them &s;uppo&s;ed was the Baronet's daughter, Sir Gui&s;e, Otley,
<PB N="118" REF="127">and Miles, would have breathed their la&s;t on the identical &s;pot where they had begun the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Thus implored, they &s;uffered at length the mi&s;creant and his minions to e&s;cape, and the mob turned all their attention to the young woman, who,&mdash;after recovering, and being a&s;&s;ured, by the generous George, in a ten|der whi&s;per, that Sir Gui&s;e had got off alive,&mdash;was carried by the people &s;afe back to the inn. Here they met Sir Armine, Mr. Clare, and the ladies, coming in con&s;ternation to know what had been the re&s;ult of the affray. Olivia &s;eeing Henry, for whom &s;he had felt terrors not to be de&s;cribed, fell into a &s;tate &s;carce le&s;s pitiable than that of Jane. But at length the adventure of the running fight was explained, the company took &s;ome more refre&s;hment, and the good &s;urgeon telling Sir Armine, the &s;ooner he left the &s;cene of agitation, and got to his own quiet home, the better, Partington ordered the hor&s;es and carriages to be brought out, and Sir Armine, his friends and familty left the eventful inn.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="128">But they had not yet arrived at the land of peace; for the &s;ame multitude which had di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed Sir Gui&s;e with &s;o many marks of di&s;|approbation, would not part with Sir Armine without greetings of as violent applau&s;e; they hung on the wheels of his coach, took off the hor&s;es, and drew him along in triumph; they ran after him for &s;ome miles, crying out "God ble&s;s Sir Armine!" and at la&s;t &s;top|ped the carriages and hor&s;es, in&s;i&s;ting that Partington, Henry, and all the retinue, &s;hould join them in three cheers, to the honour of Sir Armine. After which they gave a univer&s;al huzza, and &s;uffered the vehicles and hor&s;emen to proceed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;t of the journey was performed without any farther interruptions, except that towards the end of it Sir Armine complained of unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations in his &s;tomach, which, he &s;aid, he was apprehen&s;ive were the forebod|ings of his old con&s;titutional enemy, the gout.</P>
<P>At length, however, the antique towers and gothic avenues of Ad&s;ell Hall appeared in
<PB N="120" REF="129">view, and the evening &s;un was playing its beams on the romantic &s;cenery around, at the pro&s;pects of which different &s;entiments were produced in the minds of &s;ome of the com|pany.</P>
<P>In the fine eyes and complexion of Olivia, were written all tho&s;e tender perturbations, hopes, and fears, which till now the late occurrences had bani&s;hed from her gentle bo|&s;om, but &s;he &s;aid nothing. "It was at the altar of that old chapel, my child," ob&s;erved Mr. Clare, "that your grandfather was made the happie&s;t of mankind.&mdash;O may the heirs to his fortune, the fair domain that is now opening upon us, &s;ucceed to that richer po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, his un&s;peakable felicity! for I know by my own heart&mdash;widower as it is, and <HI>wholly</HI> bereaved as it would be but for thee, Olivia," the old gentleman tenderly drew his daughter towards him, "I know there is no earthly trea&s;ure &s;o invaluable as a cha&s;te and virtuous companion&mdash;&s;uch as, alas! I have lo&s;t!" Mr. Clare brought his daughter's hand from his bo&s;om to his lips, and impre&s;&s;ed it with a ki&s;s that was moi&s;tened with a
<PB N="121" REF="130">tear, while Olivia gently lifted her other hand to the old man's cheek, and wreathing her arm by degrees round his neck, repaid the precious drops which he had &s;hed with ten|fold intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Meantime, Sir Armine forgot every for|mer pain in the &s;upremely happy reflection of &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the excellent Lady Fitz|orton, whom having viewed for &s;ome mo|ments with con&s;cious pride, he exclaimed, with an energy that &s;poke the &s;oul&mdash;"The years of that lovely girl almo&s;t thrice num|bered," pointing to Olivia, "ha&s;t thou been the ble&s;&s;ing of my life!"</P>
<P>The coachman was ordered to &s;top at the top of the hill, from whence Ad&s;ell Hall park and chapel were di&s;covered, and where the&s;e little pictures of family happine&s;s were drawn. Henry and Partington had rode on one &s;ide of the road, keeping even with the coach; and the po&s;t-chariot, in which were George and Jane, to whom her brother was now added, drew up on the other, more in appre|hen&s;ion of Sir Armine's returning &s;ickne&s;s,
<PB N="122" REF="131">than in expectance of tho&s;e &s;weetly tearful &s;en&s;ations which welcome the pains, if pains they may be called, of a tender heart. The whole group, therefore, characteri&s;tically felt the &s;cene. Henry, who had witne&s;&s;ed it from the time of Mr. Clare's paternal prayer to Sir Armine's la&s;t reflection, and to whom the &s;ight of the chapel brought back every ago|ni&s;ing anticipation, counterfeited but ill the &s;mile he gave to Mr. Clare when that good man wi&s;hed him all the bli&s;s that both their hou&s;es had experienced in marriage. Henry bowed acknowledgment, but, ob&s;erving the evening dews were falling, advi&s;ed his father to avoid them by &s;uffering him to order the coachman and po&s;tillion to drive bri&s;kly to the Hall. By this manoeuvre he e&s;caped the &s;everity of any farther trial of his feelings. True George wept and laughed by turns; young Atwood bore him company; but Jane was &s;o overwhelmed with the con|flicts which preceded, that, when the car|riages were again in motion, &s;he felt relieved. Some minutes before, Partington, who&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="132">&s;en&s;ibility had been variou&s;ly excited, turned his hor&s;e from the coach again into the road, &s;wearing, "that Sir Gui&s;e and his worthy pair of friends were archangels to Sir Armine and his family, who, he plainly &s;aw"&mdash;here he rubbed his eyes, which were not dry&mdash;"had a de&s;ire to blind him fir&s;t, and then to break his heart; for which, among&s;t a multitude of other obliging favours, he con&s;idered the whole body, men and women, as a &s;et of d****d good-for-nothing a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inating caitiffs and &s;coundrels."</P>
<P>At length they arrived at the place of de&s;tination. The &s;un had ju&s;t made "a golden &s;et;" the villagers were a&s;&s;embled on the green which neighboured the hall, to pay their fir&s;t &s;alutations; and the rural bells joined merrily in chorus to the notes of univer&s;al welcome. It was, indeed, con&s;idered by the inhabitants of the &s;urrounding pari&s;hes as a jubilee, which had been expected by the pea&s;antry and hu&s;bandmen for many years: Their lovely patrone&s;s was now come among&s;t them, not only to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
<PB N="124" REF="133">ample inheritance, but to &s;hare it, as they had often heard, with a youth generous as her&s;elf, and from who&s;e liberal regulations they ex|pected to derive all the benefits of hone&s;t indu&s;try, and of ea&s;y &s;ervitude; for it had been given out that if the young '&s;quire and his lady liked Ad&s;ell-Hall, they were to fit it up for their general re&s;idence; a point of the utmo&s;t importance to the &s;ons and daughters of poverty. That nothing on their parts, therefore, might be wanting, whatever could demon&s;trate re&s;pect, gratitude, and zeal, were now to be &s;een and heard.</P>
<P>A village poet, who&s;e metre was looked upon, by the ru&s;tics, as the &s;ublime&s;t effort of human genius, pre&s;ented a gratulatory ode, in the la&s;t &s;tanza of which he promi&s;ed an epithalamium when the young couple &s;hould attend the altar of Hymen. A rural mu|&s;ician, who&s;e untutored melody was at lea&s;t a match for the uncouth rhime of the afore|&s;aid bard, compo&s;ed a cantata, which was to be rehear&s;ed the evening of the arrival, but to be played to a full band, immediately
<PB N="125" REF="134">after the ceremony&mdash;the barber having pro|mi&s;ed his flute, the hunt&s;man of a neigh|bouring '&s;quire, his horn, and the clerk of an attorney from the next market-town, his fiddle, the compo&s;er him&s;elf literally <HI>execut|ing</HI> harmony on the ba&s;&s;oon. Six of the village maids were &s;elected, by &s;age matrons, to twine chaplets of je&s;&s;amine and ro&s;es; cudgel-playing, &s;ingle-&s;tick and cricket were al&s;o in preparation, and a variety of other honorary tokens of duty, good-will, and ho|mage, were de&s;igned to celebrate the nuptials of Henry Fitzorton and the blooming lady of the manor.</P>
<P>The&s;e innocent te&s;timonies of ru&s;tic &s;ati&s;|faction were highly acceptable to all but Henry, who, having now had lei&s;ure for retro&s;pect, looked upon every preparation as a garland to decorate a grand &s;acrifice, of which <HI>he</HI> was to be the principal victim. And yet matters had now gone to &s;uch length, he &s;aw no way to e&s;cape. His obligations to Olivia, who&s;e virtues were ever under his eyes, multiplied every hour. His ob&s;tacles to the hand of Caroline were
<PB N="126" REF="135">increa&s;ed tenfold within the la&s;t two days; even though, before, they did not &s;eem to admit of augmentation. All that could be expected was a little delay, that his father might recover his late fatigue before he entered on a fre&s;h cour&s;e of tumultuary hap|pine&s;s; and even this, Sir Armine determined, &s;hould po&s;tpone the fe&s;tivity only twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>There was a rough hone&s;ty in the good Partington, who, albeit, unu&s;ed to the &s;oft parts of &s;peech, had as much nicety in feel|ing, as bluntne&s;s in expre&s;&s;ion. He was often on the point of at once extricating Henry by unfolding his &s;ituation to Mr. Clare, or even to Olivia her&s;elf; for he en|tered into the &s;pirit of Henry's objections; and though he did not &s;ee the lea&s;t po&s;|&s;ibility of his friend being united to the woman he loved&mdash;the daughter of the villain, or, as Partington him&s;elf called him, the worthy gentleman who would have murdered Sir Armine&mdash;he could look for nothing but grief and di&s;appointment in marrying one whom he did <HI>not</HI> love,
<PB N="127" REF="136">even though it was the charming Olivia. But the bu&s;ine&s;s of interference was difficult and delicate; and after long deliberation, he once more took Henry a&s;ide to &s;ay, "My dear &s;coundrel, I can do you no good, and I do not choo&s;e to run the hazard of doing you any harm; &s;o to-morrow morning I &s;hall take my&s;elf back into my own country, attended by young Atwood, who&s;e family are now in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about him. All I have to ob&s;erve is, that if you have no better means than a &s;econd elopement, and wi&s;h for an a&s;ylum, I can lock you up in my cellar; in de&s;cending to which there is a well-&s;tored pantry, and there you may remain, you unhap|py villain, till you have drunk and eat me out: for I mu&s;t confe&s;s, as love is not on <HI>your</HI> &s;ide of the que&s;tion, you would do better to live with "toads in the vapour of a dun|geon," as that incomparable old &s;coundrel Will Shake&s;peare expre&s;&s;es it, than with the faire&s;t and fine&s;t girl in the world in a palace; for in that ca&s;e, to my firm thoughts, Olivia is no better than an oy&s;ter-wench."</P>
<P>With this &s;entiment he left Henry, forlorn and undecided, and would have made ready
<PB N="128" REF="137">for his journey, but for one of tho&s;e un|fore&s;een interventions which, in this world of changes, baffles the limited fore&s;ight of man, and &s;ometimes, at a moment's warning, &s;ometimes without it, levels emperors and empires, and every laboured edifice of their power, fancy, and ambition, in that common du&s;t of nature, out of which they, and all that they create or inherit, were formed; proving at once the &s;trength and weakne&s;s of mortality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>ON the evening of the day preceding the intended nuptials, Sir Armine felt him|&s;elf unexpectedly faint, accompanied by a &s;light return of his pains in different parts of the body, but particularly in that where he had received the ruffian's la&s;t da&s;tardly blow. He withdrew to his chamber, before the u&s;ual hour, convinced him&s;elf, and convincing others, that a few hours re&s;t, which he felt he &s;hould enjoy, would make him ri&s;e more alert in the morning than either the intended
<PB N="129" REF="138">bride or bridegroom. Re&s;i&s;ting all offers to have anybody &s;it up with him, and it having been &s;ettled, before he was taken ill, that on this, the la&s;t night of Olivia's &s;ingle &s;tate, Lady Fitzorton was to be the partner of her bed, he went up &s;tairs, peremptorily refu&s;ing company or a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and as Lady Fitz|orton &s;aw he was not in a temper of mind to be controlled, &s;he vexed him not with importunity.</P>
<P>But growing wor&s;e in the night, he re&s;orted to, as he thought, a bottle of lau|danum, in who&s;e powers he had always too much faith; and although in much agony, he was unwilling to di&s;turb any of the family, thinking the di&s;order would pa&s;s away in the profoundne&s;s of that &s;leep which the &s;uppo&s;ed laudanum, his favourite panacea, would procure. He went &s;o ha&s;tily to the clo&s;et, where, the day before, he had locked up all his medicines, that the lamp went out; and in this &s;tate of darkne&s;s and uncertainty, as he was in &s;earch of &s;omething to hold the laudanum, he unfortunately laid his hand on a cup in which had been mixed up, and
<PB N="130" REF="139">incautiou&s;ly left by the hou&s;e &s;teward, a pre|paration of ar&s;enic and other poi&s;onous drugs, to de&s;troy &s;ome rats which had infe&s;ted &s;everal parts of the dilapidated man&s;ion. Anxious to remove the malady which he felt every minute increa&s;ing, he re&s;orted again to the medicine-che&s;t, and poured a double proportion of his favourite anodyne upon the dregs, which having drunk, he re|turned to his bed.</P>
<P>The deadly quality of the poi&s;on was for &s;ome time overborne by the balmy power of the anodyne, and poor Sir Armine en|joyed a temporary repo&s;e; out of which, alas! he was rou&s;ed at the dawn of the day by &s;en&s;ations of mi&s;ery that raged through his whole frame. The family were alarmed: they found Sir Armine in &s;peechle&s;s agony; at a tran&s;ient interval of which, he with difficulty exclaimed,&mdash;"The laudanum! the laudanum! &s;ome dire mi&s;take!"&mdash;A &s;hriek from the wife of the hou&s;e &s;teward, who had taken up the cup out of which Sir Armine had drank the fatal potion, now augmented the con&s;ternation by wildly crying out&mdash;
<PB N="131" REF="140">"O! why did not my hu&s;band remove this cruel, cruel cup? His Honour, ladies, has &s;wallowed poi&s;on!&mdash;This cup, alas! this cup!"&mdash;Incapable of fini&s;hing the &s;entence, &s;he fell on the floor.&mdash;"Poi&s;oned! Sir Ar|mine poi&s;oned!" ejaculated every one pre|&s;ent; "the God of heaven and earth for|bid!"</P>
<P>On the arrival of the very &s;urgeon who attended Sir Armine at Ad&s;ell, and whom True George, almo&s;t with the rapidity of wings, had fetched from thence, medicines were admini&s;tered, which, after a violent operation of &s;ome hours, gave gleams of hope that Sir Armine might be re&s;tored, &s;o far as human means could recover him. On the fourth day, by judicious treatment, he could bear to &s;it up, and &s;aw, by turns, every one of his family in his chamber: Henry was &s;till his con&s;tant attendant, and rarely left the bed-&s;ide. His beloved hand&mdash;for in &s;ickne&s;s as in health he was his darling&mdash;admini&s;tered the cordials, and they &s;eemed to acquire new energies from
<PB N="132" REF="141">&s;uch mini&s;tration. The gentle Olivia too was often at the door, even when it was impo&s;|&s;ible to gain entrance. The &s;olicitous inquiries of the villagers, after their venerable and reverend pa&s;tor and patron, were ince&s;&s;ant. In the end, the poi&s;on &s;eemed wholly ex|pelled by the antidotes, but had left his ge|neral health &s;o much invaded, his frame, even to its &s;tamina, &s;o &s;haken, his &s;tomach was &s;o torn by his old malignant enemy, and, perhaps even yet, &s;ome internal pains from tho&s;e brui&s;es which a more inveterate foe had inflicted, that the effects of all the&s;e evils brought on a complication of ills, for which perhaps, in the mo&s;t vigorous bloom of man's life, there could have been no e&s;tabli&s;hed cure, but which mu&s;t inevitably, even in the firme&s;t con&s;titution, and &s;uch Sir Armine had been ble&s;t with, have ter|minated in a manner the mo&s;t fatal.</P>
<P>The dreaded &s;troke which was to &s;eparate this venerable man therefore from his family came on "with &s;olemn &s;teps, and &s;low;" but, alas! they were not le&s;s certain than if the dire
<PB N="133" REF="142">power of the poi&s;on had continued to rage: he was in a manner dying daily under their eyes, but happily his pangs were le&s;s and le&s;s acute. Thus he regained comparative ea&s;e of body and tranquillity of mind; and though a&s;&s;ured of death's approaches for &s;ome weeks before the "fatal arrow &s;ped," he di&s;played to all around a rare example of paternal tenderne&s;s, patience, and every chri&s;tian virtue.</P>
<P>When Sir Armine felt his hour at hand, which he expected more than a week before it arrived, he expre&s;&s;ed wi&s;hes to her who&s;e delight had ever been to obey them, that he might breathe his la&s;t at Fitzorton Ca&s;tle. Thither, therefore, he was removed by &s;low degrees, and &s;eemed much the better both for the air and exerci&s;e of the journey.</P>
<P>What a &s;educer is the heart! It again de|ceived all the Fitzortons and Clares with a fal&s;e but &s;oothing hope, that Sir Armine might yet be &s;pared to them. And when the&s;e fond expectations were imparted to their object, he received them with a &s;mile,
<PB N="134" REF="143">which &s;hewed his reluctance to damp an in|nocent delu&s;ion which he &s;aw gave them plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The di&s;order, neverthele&s;s, in &s;ilent depreda|tion went on; and in the evening of the fatal night in which its victim departed, he de&s;ired &s;uch of the family as were then in his room to leave him. "All of you," &s;aid Sir Armine, holding Henry by the hand, "but this young man, with whom I wi&s;h to confer; and when I ring the bell, let it, I pray, be con&s;idered as a &s;ummons for your return to me."&mdash;They obeyed.</P>
<P>"O! thou the neare&s;t to my heart!" &s;aid he to Henry, "in this its la&s;t hour of motion&mdash;for the hand of death is out&s;tretched, I &s;ee it hovering over my pillow&mdash;Thou! for whom it throbs with tenderne&s;s unutter|able&mdash;I charge thee with my expiring breath, and by my parting &s;oul's eternal hope, as &s;oon after my decea&s;e as the decent forms of the world allow, not to delay fulfilling the purpo&s;e for which the journey that will produce my di&s;&s;olution was undertaken; for
<PB N="135" REF="144">were all other motives annihilated,&mdash;and I have pardoned all men&mdash;even as I hope to be pardoned&mdash;all motives, I &s;ay, but tho&s;e which are due to the be&s;t of the aged, and of the young&mdash;to my earlie&s;t friend, and to his child, tho&s;e are all &s;ufficient. My own immediate death is not more inevitable, than would be theirs on your refu&s;al. Perhaps, my dear Hen|ry, this point of union has been pre&s;&s;ed on my part with too fond a &s;olicitude&mdash;beyond a parent's authority. It is my only pang in death. You mu&s;t place it among&s;t the faults of my long life; but it is, alas! now too late to avail your&s;elf of this error. Guard then with the mo&s;t religious care from the father, and the child, who&s;e fate is in your hand, the remote&s;t thought of it ever having been nece&s;&s;ary for me to <HI>urge</HI> this &s;ubject, and con|ceal yet more religiou&s;ly the &s;ecret attach|ment you have unadvi&s;edly once entertained for any other woman, more particularly for the daughter of the man who&mdash;but I will not in&s;ult you by farther mention of that Im|placable, who&s;e conduct you mu&s;t deprecate.
<PB N="136" REF="145">Think that my late&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, even if not withheld, cannot be de&s;erved&mdash;if&mdash;."</P>
<P>"O! I will be the victim of a thou&s;and &s;acrifices, die a thou&s;and deaths," exclaimed Henry, in an agony, "to de&s;erve and to re|ceive that ble&s;&s;ing."</P>
<P>"Receive it mo&s;t certainly thou &s;halt," &s;aid Sir Armine, "even if it be not de&s;erved: It will be my duty to give, but it re&s;ts with my &s;on to be&s;tow, or to refu&s;e, what will im|part to that duty all its &s;weetne&s;s. My &s;on, decide; thy father's life hangs by a thread, which the next breath may &s;ever."</P>
<P>Henry was &s;o utterly ab&s;orbed as &s;carce to hear his father's thrice repeated command, to ring the bell; when, however, he obeyed, the family re-appeared.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e, we have to number John Fitzorton, who had been, at length, informed of Sir Armine's extremity, the cau&s;e of which however was to be imputed to the accident of the poi&s;on. Every one, but e&s;pecially Sir Armine, trembled at the con&s;equences, &s;hould the part that Sir Gui&s;e had taken be made
<PB N="137" REF="146">known. From the vow of &s;ilence, therefore, which Sir Armine impo&s;ed, the family was only in part relea&s;ed. John had rode almo&s;t at full &s;peed two days and nights, to take his everla&s;ting leave of a parent whom he loved with a &s;trength and ardour not infe|rior to that which was borne him by Henry or James, and this ardour in&s;pired him with a &s;peed that even out&s;tripped the rapidities of the former.</P>
<P>But his father's exhau&s;ted appearance, the depredation that had been made in his maje&s;tic form, the &s;inking voice, the faded eye, the trembling hand, and the various wrecks of a deathbed &s;ickne&s;s, &s;truck the heart of John with a di&s;may far beyond the powers of &s;peech; but though &s;ilence enchained his tongue, the friend, the &s;on, the man, &s;poke in every feature, flowed, when he <HI>could</HI> weep, in every tear, and agoni&s;ed in every groan.</P>
<P>"Thou art in good time, my ine&s;timable John," &s;aid his father, "to receive my warme&s;t ble&s;&s;ing! my warme&s;t gratitude! Thou art in time, al&s;o, to witne&s;s the hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="138" REF="147">with which a chri&s;tian can leave this world! plea&s;ed, and proud, at the thought of bequeathing to it, in his own family, &s;ome of its noble&s;t ornaments and examples."</P>
<P>John Fitzorton uttered not a &s;entence, yet &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;uffocated from the powers of &s;peech refu&s;ed&mdash;the relief, even of a &s;ingle tear, was long denied him. After his fir&s;t &s;urvey of his father's &s;ituation, he had hurried round to the left &s;ide of the bed, fell on his knees, put his father's hand into his bo&s;om, there held it, and looked &s;teadily at Sir Armine's countenance.</P>
<P>The object of his care here &s;pread forth his arms, as if to illu&s;trate his eulogy by en|circling his family, Mr. Clare, and Olivia. In the intermediate &s;pace betwixt his life and death, as Henry was leaning over his pillow, a whi&s;pered que&s;tion and reply pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Armine and his younge&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>"Is my ble&s;&s;ing to be de&s;erved?"</P>
<P>"O! in all things now left within my power."</P>
<P>"All I require is in your power," &s;aid Sir Armine.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="148">Henry &s;eemed eager to &s;ay &s;omething in reply, but his father prevented, by invoking upon his <HI>obedient</HI> &s;on the la&s;t benediction of a dying parent. He then cla&s;ped Henry in his arms, beckoning to Olivia to receive him from an expiring father as her future guardian and hu&s;band. Then taking up a Bible which he had been frequently reading, and which at all times, in &s;ickne&s;s and in health was laid behind his pillow, he pre&s;&s;ed it with fervour to his lips, emphatically re|peating&mdash;"The everla&s;ting benediction of a father be upon ye both!" He then delivered the book to Henry, &s;aying, after an earne&s;t gaze, who&s;e meaning could not be mi&s;taken, "Do thou likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>Henry, the victim of a thou&s;and emotions, ki&s;&s;ed the &s;acred volume with an ardour, as if he hoped, from its holy power, the in&s;pira|tion of fortitude greater than his own; and, in a voice &s;uited to &s;uch expected &s;uccour, exclaimed, "On the holy bond of the&s;e awe|ful leaves do I &s;wear to ratify the commands of a dying parent."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="149">"Enough," &s;aid Sir Armine: "I die in peace."</P>
<P>Sir Armine &s;urvived this &s;peech only a few hours; but the reader will permit us to conduct him ha&s;tily from the &s;acred apart|ment, and quit for a while the melancholy ca&s;tle of Fitzorton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WE were con&s;trained to leave the un|happy Caroline in various di&s;tre&s;s, occa&s;ion|ed by the receipt of Olivia's letter, which, as the reader remembers, threw the whole party whom it concerned&mdash;and it involved the de&s;tiny of &s;everal per&s;ons&mdash;into per|plexities, out of which there appeared no friendly clue.</P>
<P>To this, on the part of Caroline, &s;uc|ceeded the &s;ecret departure of her brother and father, with an air of my&s;tery which foreboded fre&s;h calamities. In this &s;olitary &s;tate, while &s;he was wandering in the thorny labyrinths of conjecture, one of her maids came into
<PB N="141" REF="150">her chamber, and officiou&s;ly related the news which had been brought by a tenant who had pa&s;&s;ed through Ad&s;ell, and was come to &s;ettle his yearly accounts at the ab|bey.</P>
<P>This man had told Denni&s;on, in the heed|le&s;s girl's hearing, the hi&s;tory of the affray as he had picked it up in the kitchen of the inn, where truth was &s;o far from being the hi&s;torian, that every fact was di&s;torted; and by the time the good farmer had travelled with it to the abbey, for he made a &s;top at every public hou&s;e in his way, it had grown to &s;uch a frightful &s;ize, that even at Ad&s;ell, had it been carried back again in the &s;tate it was delivered to Caroline, or at lea&s;t as related to her by the maid-&s;ervant, it would &s;carce have been known to be the &s;tory of Sir Gui&s;e's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and of Sir Armine's con&s;equent malady.</P>
<P>The farmer recorded, "That his wor&s;hipful reverend Honour of Fitzorton was at the point of death; that all the company, men and women, even to the coachman on his box, were beaten almo&s;t to mummies; and that,
<PB N="142" REF="151">in&s;tead of marriage, there was, God willing, in all likelihood, to be a burial ceremony of them all.&mdash;That his honorable's di&s;hone&s;t landlord Sir Gui&s;e, his unhonorable madam, who 'tis thought is lurking hard by, and his hanger-on Miles, as pure a limb of the devil as you &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee, and another ill-looked fellow, all jumped out of a wood at once, &s;napped their blunderbu&s;&s;es, drew their broad&s;words, and went de&s;perateou&s;ly to work; and being taken by one 'Squire Bart|ington or Partington, were thru&s;t into an old barn till Sir Armine was dead, then to go before ju&s;tice, who, it was thought, would order them all for gaol, then to the gallows." To this intelligence the farmer added, "that the young Captain Stuart, brave as a lion's whelp, ran for it, le&s;t he &s;hould be hanged too, as one of the accompli&s;hes, though he had no hand in it; but like father like &s;on, they &s;ay you know; yet he took Sir Armine's part again&s;t his own father, whom he thra&s;hed heartily: good that; but, thought I, he &s;hould have got another thra&s;her. I had &s;ome notion, Ma&s;ter Denni&s;on, of a&s;king to &s;ee
<PB N="143" REF="152">the wicked old gentleman after he had got into Lob's Pound, &s;o &s;ave my&s;elf the trouble of this journey, by paying my rent to him|&s;elf," &s;aid the farmer; "for though he's an old rogue, under favour, it's no rea&s;on I &s;hould be one too; but on &s;econd thoughts, I remembered to have read in a book, that a pri&s;oner's bond is no bond, a nulli|fication, as they &s;ay; &s;o, thought I, what &s;ignifies his Honour's receipt to I, now, &s;eeing his body is the lawyer's, and his hand-writing, by the &s;ame token, a nullification: another rea|&s;on was, that I did not like to be &s;een in com|pany with his Honour after he was a &s;a&s;&s;in|ator, for thought I&mdash;I am, you know, Mr. Denni&s;on, a pretty bit of a thinker&mdash;yes, thought I to I, I may be had up as a wit|ne&s;s, or &s;ummut or other, and law work often takes a man from bu&s;ine&s;s: and moreover, I had my thoughts about me after another fa&s;hion: I did not like to give &s;o much money into the hands of a man who was in a hanging condition, &s;eeing as mayhap his family had a better right to it than Mr. John Catch; and moreover there's no knowing,
<PB N="144" REF="153">thought I, to what &s;traits a great gentleman like Sir Gui&s;e may be driven to, before he takes to the highway: and who knows, thought I&mdash;a keen one, an't I&mdash;but if I pay this rent of mine to Ma&s;ter Denni&s;on, who I know to be an hone&s;t man, but Mi&s;s or the Captain may be the better for it&mdash;an hone&s;t one too, you &s;ee&mdash;&s;o thought I, I will e'en &s;eem to take no notice; but after baiting my bea&s;t, and lunching a bit my&s;elf, I will jog on and let 'em know how matters are here at Ad&s;ell; for, thought I, mayhap poor Mi&s;s at home knows nothing of what rogues tricks her father has been doing in tho&s;e um' parts there: So, Mr. Denni&s;on, here I am, here's my money, and here's the long and &s;hort of the &s;tory."</P>
<P>Had not Denni&s;on been too much occu|pied by the circum&s;tances to attend whether there had been any auditors in the room but him&s;elf, he would, doubtle&s;s, have attempted to &s;et the &s;eal of &s;ecrecy on the lips of the loquacious maid; but &s;he happened to have ju&s;t returned from &s;weeping Denni&s;on's little parlour, when the farmer came; and as the
<PB N="145" REF="154">door was left on the jar, the girl &s;tood with open eyes and ears, &s;u&s;pended on her bru&s;h, devouring every &s;yllable, and the moment the tale-bearer had ended, &s;he ran, without wait|ing to hear Denni&s;on's comments, to make a report of even more than the whole; fir&s;t to her young lady, and then to every one of her fellow &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the terror and a&s;toni&s;h|ment which the&s;e tidings produced in the mind of Caroline, &s;he &s;aw that much was magnified by the fears of the maid, and al|lowed for the natural progre&s;s of a malicious tale; yet enough of the probable remained, after all rea&s;onable deductions, to excite ap|prehen&s;ions that &s;omething dreadful had hap|pened, and that almo&s;t every per&s;on mo&s;t near and dear to her was concerned. She would have gone down to the farmer and que&s;tioned him her&s;elf, but that another of the maid &s;ervants at that time came to the apartment with Denni&s;on's dutiful de&s;ire, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, to hold &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with her. The object of this interview was to conceal with much care every thing that
<PB N="146" REF="155">had been already divulged, and at the &s;ame time to frame &s;ome excu&s;e for his (Denni|&s;on's) journey to Ad&s;ell, where the good &s;teward &s;aid he had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e his pre|&s;ence might be &s;erviceable on a little matter of bu&s;ine&s;s. "Farmer Spedman has been here, Mi&s;s," &s;aid the good old man, under great emotion which he laboured to hide; "and I find by him all matters, re&s;pecting his honour's e&s;tates which lie in that county, are not to his honour's liking; and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;as&mdash;perhaps&mdash;his honour, and young ma&s;ter, and the re&s;t, he had rea&s;ons to &s;uppo&s;e, were detained there&mdash;or&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;and perhaps did not choo&s;e to let your lady&s;hip know, becau&s;e it might vex your lady&s;hip, I&mdash;I&mdash;I think&mdash;it may be right for me to &s;et off and &s;ee what can be done&mdash;&s;o I de&s;ired the farmer to go before, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Denni&s;on," &s;aid Caroline, "I &s;ee your di&s;tre&s;s; but I have heard as much of the &s;ad &s;tory brought by Farmer Spedman as your|&s;elf, and am &s;o far from di&s;approving your journey to Ad&s;ell&mdash;for there I under&s;tand the unfortunates are a&s;&s;embled&mdash;that I am deter|mined

Then turning to the maid &s;ervant, and &s;aying, "Betty, I &s;hall want your a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance," was ha&s;tening out of the room. Den|ni&s;on, who apprehended more than Caroline, or at lea&s;t than &s;he thought fit to expre&s;s, tried many ways to gain permi&s;&s;ion for his undertaking the journey alone; ob&s;erving, "that if any thing wor&s;e than he hoped had happened&mdash;"</P>

<PB N="148" REF="157">&s;econd time, her brother the Lieutenant made his appearance. The happine&s;s of &s;eeing one of the per&s;ons deare&s;t to her &s;oul return alive, gave cheerful pre&s;age of the re&s;t, and &s;he was opening her arms to receive him, when that afflicted youth, after violently &s;tamping on the ground to expre&s;s contrary emotions, too &s;trong for utterance, &s;taggered to a chair and bur&s;t into a flood of tears; pre&s;ently, &s;eeing only the confidential Denni&s;on with his &s;i&s;ter, the maid &s;ervant being gone out of the room, "My dear Caroline," &s;aid Charles, "pre|pare to leave this pe&s;t-hou&s;e immediately&mdash;It is the &s;eat of contagion, di&s;grace, and &s;hame. It has covered us with blu&s;hes&mdash;Fly with your unhappy brother this moment."</P>
<P>"I was going to quit it," replied the trem|bling Caroline; "but wherefore do I &s;ee you thus agitated? Where is my father? Alas! I have heard in part; and I &s;ee in your terror-&s;triking looks, your trembling lips, and &s;haking frame, the dreadful news&mdash;Yes, let us fly this in&s;tant to his re&s;cue."</P>
<P>"His re&s;cue!" cried Charles, "the re&s;cue of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in! a common cut-throat! a mur|derer! Would&s;t thou fly to re&s;cue him?
<PB N="149" REF="158">No; it is to e&s;cape his pre&s;ence&mdash;to avoid him for ever. Ah! my unhappy, beloved &s;i&s;ter, let us hide our di&s;graceful heads in &s;ome unthought-of corner; for that I am come; and but for the love of thee, no earthly power &s;hould have brought me to the accur&s;ed &s;pot, which returns on my me|mory the author of our injuries."</P>
<P>Denni&s;on &s;aw this was no time to rea&s;on down the rage, and almo&s;t phrenzy of Charles, or to enter into a detail of que&s;tions; falling, therefore, on his knees, while the big drops of &s;ympathy flowed down his cheeks, he im|plored to be partner of his young ma&s;ter's and lady's fortunes whither&s;oever they led. While he was yet kneeling, the good father Arthur entered, like a patriarch bearing a commi&s;&s;ion from the God of gods.</P>
<P>"Rather implore my brother, good old man," cried Caroline, "in the &s;upplicatory po&s;ture you are now in, not to defert <HI>him,</HI> to whom, whatever are his frailties, or even his vices, he owes his exi&s;tence, and lea&s;t of all to leave him in mi&s;ery, and wretchedne&s;s, and &s;hame, if &s;uch are to be his fate. No!
<PB N="150" REF="159">my deare&s;t, deare&s;t brother; you will not for|&s;ake your father at &s;uch a de&s;olate moment. If he is mo&s;t guilty, he is mo&s;t pitiable; if he is in a pri&s;on, his &s;oul and body equally call upon us by the voice of Nature to mini&s;ter calm to his de&s;pair. His con&s;cience&mdash;nay, his very crimes invite us to him. O! holy monk! convince my brother of this. Sir Gui&s;e, it &s;eems, has, in the furious extreme of &s;ome unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion to which his nature, alas! is &s;ubject, done a de&s;perate deed, which threatens his life. Exert, I conjure you," continued &s;he, falling at Arthur's feet, and catching one of his hands, as Denni&s;on had done the other&mdash;"exert, I conjure you, your pious eloquence to penetrate the filial heart of this good youth with a due &s;en&s;e of what he owes even to an erring parent&mdash;convince him that a father <HI>cannot</HI> be guilty beyond the reach of a child's commi&s;eration."</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e, deare&s;t Caroline; I <HI>am</HI> convinced that thou art as good and virtuous as he is vicious and unworthy. But collect your&s;elf, my worthy friend," &s;aid Arthur, "and be not too ra&s;h in deciding any offence beyond the

<P>Charles incoherently related all the facts as they had happened, a&s;&s;erting, they ought no to be concealed.</P>
<P>Her father's barbarity, and calm, deter|mined rancour, Sir Armine's &s;ufferings and ennobled humanity, her brother's wounded &s;pi|rit, from the bleeding arrows of hopele&s;s love, lacerated friend&s;hip, and a parent's vices, all &s;hot into the bo&s;om of Caroline at once; and, alas! not the lea&s;t hard to bear, the filial, ever-active vigilance of Henry, &s;o like her own, the agonizing &s;truggle betwixt uncon|querable love, his con&s;ideration for Olivia, affection for his di&s;appointed friends, and duty to an injured father, who, by &s;aving the al|mo&s;t-forfeited life of Sir Gui&s;e, had new claims on his &s;on's obedience;&mdash;all the&s;e, and a thou|&s;and other piercing reflections bore down her &s;pirits to the earth, on which &s;he fell, with a wi&s;h, that it were indeed the mea&s;ure of her grave. She recovered from the&s;e accumulated
<PB N="152" REF="161">&s;hocks, only to feel new pangs, for Charles read the letter &s;ent him by Henry from Ad&s;ell Inn.</P>
<P>Denni&s;on and Arthur, ab&s;orbed almo&s;t be|yond &s;en&s;e of Caroline's &s;ituation, lifted up their hands in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment; and the latter, on reviewing the wonder-working powers of Providence, thus making the very means that Sir Gui&s;e Stuart had u&s;ed to de|&s;troy others de&s;tructive of their ends, bur&s;t out&mdash;"Yes, it cannot be di&s;puted; the Poet is right&mdash;
<Q>All chance direction, which we cannot &s;ee!</Q></P>
<P>Caroline now again &s;ignified her un&s;haken re&s;olve to &s;eek her father, and follow him where&s;oever di&s;tre&s;s might pur&s;ue him, en|joining her brother, by all the laws of nature and of blood, to do the &s;ame. Here a vio|lent noi&s;e, as of many voices &s;houting within and without the hou&s;e, arre&s;ted every one's attention, but before any conjecture as to the cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned, the tumult increa&s;ed to a degree that baffled all inquiry, and, in|deed, rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary; for Denni&s;on had &s;carce opened the door, when every &s;er|vant
<PB N="153" REF="162">in the abbey, with a number of tho&s;e from the ca&s;tle, filled the room with the con|trary cries of&mdash;"Spare him! &s;pare his life!&mdash;Kill him! kill him! he has murdered my poor ma&s;ter.&mdash;Help! help! I &s;hall be de|&s;troyed in my own hou&s;e!&mdash;The la&s;t excla|mation was &s;oon known to proceed from the mi&s;erable Sir Gui&s;e, at the &s;udden &s;ight of whom Caroline and Charles &s;tood like &s;ta|tues, motionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e. The buffeting of the multitude, however, filling all the rooms and pa&s;&s;ages, made it nece&s;&s;ary that an active part &s;hould be taken by &s;omebody, unle&s;s a wor&s;e fate was &s;uffered to overtake Sir Gui&s;e at the abbey than that he had e&s;caped at Ad&s;ell.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the good father Arthur and Denni&s;on&mdash;Charles having forced him&s;elf from the ri&s;ing &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion at the &s;ight of Sir Gui&s;e to leave the hou&s;e&mdash;&s;o powerfully exert|ed them&s;elves, and produced a calm, chiefly by an ob&s;ervation from father Arthur, on the im|propriety indecency, and impiety of &s;uch out|rage before a fair and equitable trial had con|demned a man, however deeply accu&s;ed, ex|horting them to remember they were Engli&s;h|men,
<PB N="154" REF="163">and, of cour&s;e, the &s;upports of that grand charter of their country&mdash;A BRITISH JURY.</P>
<P>National vanity, whether well or ill found|ed, is &s;eldom flattered in vain. Arthur's po|pular bait was in&s;tantly &s;wallowed, and antici|pating that univer&s;al holiday when Sir Gui&s;e &s;hould be hanged, the mob di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, and from the &s;ame motive, that influenced the in&s;urgents at Ad&s;ell. He was re&s;cued, however, barely on this &s;ide death, and Otley was left without any vi&s;ible &s;igns that there remained any life in his worthle&s;s body.</P>
<P>But a trial more awful was at hand&mdash;the Baronet had yet to pa&s;s the ordeal of an in|dignant &s;on's re&s;entment; indeed, had not the populace driven Sir Gui&s;e into this &s;nare he would have avoided it, and had taken pre|caution once more to that effect, his intention being to pa&s;s the fir&s;t night at Mrs. Tempe&s;t's lodge in the fore&s;t, where &s;he her&s;elf had lain perdue, and to remain there till he &s;hould learn whether the coa&s;t was clear at the abbey. His hope was, that his &s;on would remain with
<PB N="155" REF="164">the Fitzortons, and either not return home for &s;ome time, or, as he thought more likely, wholly give him up in &s;ilent contempt, which he could have far better &s;upported, and with him the eternal ab&s;ence of the only being he loved, than thus meet him in the height of his fury. Happy was it for Sir Gui&s;e&mdash;if di&s;|graceful life can in any po&s;ition be called hap|pine&s;s&mdash;that, as u&s;ual, the &s;weet and merciful Caroline, the humane Denni&s;on, and that man of peace and of every virtue, father Arthur, were at hand to attemper the rage of the Lieutenant;&mdash;happy, in this cri&s;is of his fate, was even the hypocri&s;y of this worthle&s;s &s;ire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now briefly to unravel the mazes by which Sir Gui&s;e Stuart and Mr. David Otley encountered the dangers exhi|bited in the la&s;t chapter.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner, then, was the Baronet and his two a&s;&s;ociates relea&s;ed from the fury of the exa&s;pe|rated rabble, whom the reader will recollect were pur&s;uing the culprits after they had receiv|ed their freedom from Sir Armine's clemency, than the redoubted Valentine, having &s;ecured a hor&s;e, the other conveyances being &s;till at the inn, &s;et off as precur&s;or for the re&s;idence of his dulcinea, Mrs. Tempe&s;t, and where the Knight of, by this time, the Woeful Counte|nance, with his tru&s;ty, but le&s;s &s;orrowful 'Squire David Otley, might have arrived without any fre&s;h enterpri&s;e or di&s;a&s;ter, had not Sir Gui&s;e's evil genius &s;ugge&s;ted the policy of getting into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion certain dangerous written te&s;ti|monies of his own and his mercenaries com|bination to do mi&s;chief. He therefore, in an unfortunate hour, advi&s;ed Otley to go, now
<PB N="159" REF="168">that the Fitzortons were ab&s;ent, to take &s;ome moveables out of the ca&s;tle; but particularly a &s;mall box, containing a &s;ecret corre&s;pond|ence on &s;everal &s;ubjects, which neither of the writers were de&s;irous &s;hould fall into the hands of Sir Armine, or any of the Fitz|ortons.</P>
<P>As to what had pa&s;&s;ed at Ad&s;ell, he &s;up|po&s;ed the time was yet too recent for the par|ticulars of their atchievements to have reached the ca&s;tle, as Sir Gui&s;e and his colleagues lo&s;t no time in returning from the &s;cene of action, after Sir Armine had permitted them to be &s;et free, and the hi&s;&s;ing delays which &s;aluted them on the road were pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Now it fell out, to the confu&s;ion of Otley's calculations, that the identical farmer Sped|man, who brought the news to the abbey&mdash;where the alarm he &s;pread prevented the good cheer which better tidings or better opportu|nity would have produced from the ho&s;pitable &s;teward&mdash;did not make all the allowances that might have been expected for the di&s;tre&s;s he occa&s;ioned; and &s;eeing him&s;elf neglected, after di&s;charging him&s;elf of &s;o much good money,
<PB N="160" REF="169">and &s;o much important intelligence, he re|pented him that he had brought either news or money. Taking, therefore, his hor&s;e, no better treated than him&s;elf, out of the &s;table, he jogged on much out of humour, and finding him&s;elf moreover, both hungry and thir&s;ty, he &s;topped at the village of Fitzorton, at the &s;ign of the Fitzorton Arms, re&s;olving to con&s;ole him&s;elf, where he was &s;ure to meet a hearty welcome for &s;ome of the ca&s;h that &s;till remained in the yellow canvas rent-bag.</P>
<P>Scarce had he &s;eated him&s;elf by the kitchen fire, all the other rooms in the little inn being engaged, and lighted his pipe&mdash;which has ever been con&s;idered a con&s;olatory as well as companionable in&s;trument, and which, when pipes were the mode angry gentlemen re&s;orted to, as angry ladies do their &s;nuff-boxes, for compo&s;ure&mdash;&s;carce, then, had &s;he hone&s;t farmer puffed away the fir&s;t whiff of his chagrin, when a general huzza, after three di&s;tinct cheers, to the health of the new married couple, a&s;&s;ailed his ears. The landlord coming at that in&s;tant from the company into the kitchen, was que&s;tioned
<PB N="161" REF="170">by our hu&s;bandman, touching the jovial &s;ounds he had ju&s;t heard.</P>
<P>"Sounds, farmer? why you mu&s;t know that Sir Armine Fitzorton, our great gen|tleman of the ca&s;tle, has a &s;on, the Lord love him! who is this day, or to-morrow, or was ye&s;terday, married to the <HI>famu&s;t</HI> heire&s;s, Mi&s;s Clare, of the&s;e parts. So the young lady's father (by Mi&s;&s;es de&s;ire) ordered the &s;ervants and neighbours to make merry on the occa&s;ion&mdash;and merry we are, you hear, and you &s;hall be &s;o too! for all comers are welcome to-night at the Fitzorton Arms!&mdash;Huzza! huzza! Fitzorton for ever!" The half-fuddled landlord now carried off the farmer, "nothing loth," to the company, a&s;&s;uring them, he &s;aw he was a fine old Grecian and a lover of the family, and would drink Fitzorton for ever, and no Stuart, and hour longer than he could &s;tand."&mdash;"Would he?" &s;aid one of the party a&s;|&s;embled,&mdash;"D&mdash;mme&mdash;then he is one of us, my boy&mdash;come&mdash;'tis a nem. con. bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Charge (all filled),&mdash;pre&s;ent (all lifted their gla&s;&s;es to their lips),&mdash;&s;ire (all drank)!"
<PB N="162" REF="171">"But what think you, gentlemen," &s;aid the landlord, who had an eye to profit as well as plea&s;ure, "to our following this up with an|other bumper?" "Aye, aye, come, a &s;enti|ment,&mdash;d&mdash;mme, I love a &s;entiment! a &s;enti|ment is the &s;oul of drinking,&mdash;May the ca&s;tle &s;tand and the abbey fall! What &s;ay you to that, gentlemen?" "I &s;ay," &s;aid the landlord, "it mu&s;t be drank."&mdash;"Drank, yes,&mdash;but how?" &s;aid one: "Marry, out of our hats! upon our knees!" "With all our hearts," cried one of the grooms;&mdash;"Charge, gentlemen."&mdash;"No, no," &s;aid one of Mr. Clare's footmen,&mdash;"No hats, but pint ba&s;ons,&mdash;Landlord&mdash;bring in all your cargo of crockery&mdash;leap, fly, you brave old youth," &s;aid the landlord, thumping him on the back. "I am flying," &s;aid the ho&s;t, and ran out. The farmer &s;wore that he would drink the health of every hone&s;t man, and the confu&s;ion of every rogue on the face of the earth, e&s;pecially the confu&s;ion of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, whom he believed to be the greate&s;t rogue, under favour, as yet unhanged:" Upon which declaration a half-pint rummer of punch was poured out by one of the &s;ervants, who,
<PB N="163" REF="172">giving for his toa&s;t,&mdash;"May every rogue have a halter!" &s;ubmitted it to the company, "Whether &s;uch a &s;entiment, as in a par|ticular manner applicable to Sir Gui&s;e, &s;hould not be a <HI>&s;wimmer</HI> as well as a brimmer? So, away &s;ome of us for that dear ro&s;y gilled ancient boy, who is gone for the crockery&mdash;" The landlord, while the man was yet &s;peak|ing, returned with his wife, maid &s;ervant, and waiter, loaded with punch-bowls, &s;ugar-ba&s;ons, and ale-pots: The toa&s;t was repeated and drank, every man kneeling and joining hands with his neighbour. To this &s;ucceeded more drinking, a great deal of plea&s;antry, and as much wit as &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations, whether in low or high life, generally furni&s;h: But the &s;incere love of the families they &s;erved was manife&s;ted both by the dome&s;tics of the Fitzortons and Clares, and an equal degree of univer&s;al execration of Sir Gui&s;e, but with re&s;ervo's in favour of Charles and Caroline, the good &s;on and daughter.</P>
<P>Hitherto, farmer Spedman had no po&s;&s;ible opportunity,&mdash;for there had been no rece&s;s from hard drinking,&mdash;to mention the &s;orrowful tidings
<PB N="164" REF="173">he had related at the abbey; and the good man, now &s;oftened by happine&s;s and ho&s;pitality, felt really a reluctance to damp it by unwel|come news; particularly as he had an in|timation the female &s;ervants of both the friendly hou&s;es were expected to a &s;upper, which was about to enter. And the farmer thought bad news would arrive too &s;oon, even if kept till after &s;upper. Making up his mind, therefore, to the maxim, that bad luck never <HI>can</HI> come too late; hone&s;t Sped|man &s;et in for a full and complete atonement with his new friends at the ca&s;tle, for the ill-u&s;age he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf to have met with at the abbey. With this idea, he joined in the general &s;pirit of the occa&s;ion, &s;hook hands with the landlord, and all the &s;ervants, as if they had been bred up together, in the &s;ame kitchen; he received the ladies with a &s;alute as they came in, and &s;elected one of the prettie&s;t as a partner; and when his recollection had wholly left him, begged the lady's pardon, and fell a&s;leep on one of the benches, to the infinite diver&s;ion of the whole company. His na&s;al organ gave &s;o|norous
<PB N="165" REF="174">evidence of &s;olid repo&s;e, till the peep of day appri&s;ed the party-coloured a&s;&s;embly it was time to break up. The butler ob&s;erved to the landlord, who would not him&s;elf have made the remark, had they drank out the week, even had they drank dry his cellar, "that there was rea&s;on in every thing, and that though their ma&s;ters were ab&s;ent, &s;ervants &s;hould be merry and wi&s;e." The morality of this &s;entiment al&s;o being agreed to nem. con. &s;ave and except the afore&s;aid landlord, who would have &s;upported a very different doctrine, while he could have &s;upported him&s;elf&mdash;the &s;nor|ing farmer was rou&s;ed, and reminded of the hour.&mdash;"So farewell, my brave old blade," &s;aid the butler, "you have been as welcome to whatever fare and fun you have found here among us, aye, and your good nap of a brace of hours into the bargain; and &s;o one &s;weep&s;takes, one parting bowl to the young couple before we bid good bye; and then to our &s;everal dwellings."</P>
<P>The bowl was brought, and &s;oon emptied, and &s;o thoroughly had the whole company
<PB N="166" REF="175">entered into the &s;pirit of keeping it up, that there is no conjecturing with how many more good wi&s;hes the &s;uppo&s;ed nuptials would have been celebrated in flowing, indeed overflowing cups, had not the farmer, between the extremes of &s;leep, intoxication, forgetfulne&s;s, and memory, ju&s;t found enough of the latter to tell the long concealed in|telligence, in nearly the &s;ub&s;tance he gave it to Denni&s;on, attaching, however, many bitter epithets to the name of Sir Gui&s;e, and as many hyperbolical encomiums whenever that of Sir Armine was mentioned. It was not without many interruptions they heard him to the end of his tale, and, at la&s;t, they all fell upon him for keeping them &s;o long ignorant of their honoured ma&s;ter's de&s;tiny: indeed had it not been for the protection of the women, the farmer, who made his e&s;cape under their au&s;pices, would have paid dear for his good fea&s;ting and mental re&s;ervation of the ill tidings.</P>
<P>The dete&s;tation they bore to Sir Gui&s;e, was now augmented tenfold; but the &s;en|timent of rage they conceived for Miles, and
<PB N="167" REF="176">more than all for David Otley, the betrayer of Family Secrets, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all de&s;cription. It could be equalled by nothing but their love, pity, and regret, for the fate of Sir Armine, on recollection of who&s;e de&s;tiny, their late univer&s;al joy was changed into as univer&s;al &s;orrow, and they &s;ought the now di&s;mantled ca&s;tle in the hone&s;t angui&s;h of their &s;ouls. So genuine is love and hate in the bo&s;oms of the genuine children of na|ture, and &s;o true is the love or hate of do|me&s;tics, the criterion of the virtue or vice of the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s. Otley's ingra|titude forms but the exception which be|longs to a general rule.</P>

<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>As the Fitzorton &s;ervants were en|tering the ca&s;tle gates, they perceived the apo&s;tate Otley coming with his letter box, out of the hou&s;e, and &s;uffering him to move a few paces, they beheld the ever-droop|ing Sir Gui&s;e, who was waiting near one
<PB N="168" REF="177">of the out-hou&s;es to join him. The whole pack opened at once, calling out&mdash;"There they are&mdash;there are the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators of our dear, dear&mdash;perhaps dead ma&s;ter, e&s;caped from pri&s;on! It is both law and ju&s;tice to &s;lay them&mdash;they ought to be torn piece-meal!" And piece-meal they would have been in&s;tantly torn, had the feet of rage been as rapid as tho&s;e of fear. The fugitives were however over-taken in the abbey-yard, and driven into the hou&s;e brui&s;ed and beaten almo&s;t to death, as we have de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable and da&s;tardly heart of Sir Gui&s;e, however, permitted him not to re&s;t, even when he was withdrawn to his chamber, where the filial Caroline carried him, and admini&s;tered with her own hand, every com|fort that &s;he was con&s;cious he did not de|&s;erve, nor did &s;he forget to di&s;patch off a me&s;&s;enger for the family phy&s;ician. Charles, once &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of Sir Gui&s;e, was now become the grand impedi|ment; for he knew what heavy weights might yet be impo&s;ed on the feelings of the un|complaining
<PB N="169" REF="178">Caroline, and he had &s;uffered of late &s;o many pains and penalties from the re&s;i&s;ting virtues of his &s;on, that a grand revolution was working in his heart, that is to &s;ay, the change of his inordinate affections to|wards Charles into as extravagant an anti|pathy: yet as this could not be evinced by any of the open cruelties he exerci&s;ed upon his daughter, he adopted a more &s;ecure yet no le&s;s effectual mode of manife&s;ting his hate, viz. in giving it the &s;moothe&s;t appear|ance&mdash;even the appearance of love.</P>
<P>He would have been be&s;t plea&s;ed, indeed, to have made his e&s;cape from the abbey, but as every body had now an eye upon him, and as the additional odium he incurred really rendered it un&s;afe for him to be &s;een abroad while his late unwarrantable a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of a man univer&s;ally beloved was recent in every memory, he fore&s;aw that he would be better accommodated in his own hou&s;e than in that even of Mrs. Tempe&s;t, as it was by no means certain what the popular mad|ne&s;s might effect on the property of a woman or her paramour, or their agents, who were
<PB N="170" REF="179">con&s;idered as in&s;trumental in &s;uch villany; though it mu&s;t be owned he was impelled thereto by the artful practice of Miles; but if any mi&s;chief &s;hould re&s;ult from it, Sir Gui&s;e rather wi&s;hed it might happen during his ab&s;ence; for the de&s;truction of the whole world was an object of no figure in his mind, compared with the &s;lighte&s;t ill that could befal him&s;elf. That the abbey, therefore, might be, while he was thus con&s;trained to do penance in it, a place of tolerable cap|tivity, he cau&s;ed it to be given out that he felt him&s;elf &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, which was by accident the truth, and it would be be nece&s;&s;ary for him to keep his chamber, and even to avoid company, as he found it rather oppre&s;&s;ive to &s;peak.</P>
<P>His object herein was to e&s;cape his &s;on Charles, the &s;hot of who&s;e angry eye he dared not encounter. But this did not avail him, for though it is true he was ill enough in body, and hara&s;&s;ed enough in &s;pirit, to keep his chamber, that very indi&s;po&s;ition was a motive with the virtuous Caroline to attend him in his hour of languor; nay more, judging
<PB N="171" REF="180">from the goodne&s;s of her own heart, that it would be a cordial to his&mdash;the mo&s;t com|fortable, indeed, he could receive&mdash;to &s;ee his darling &s;on, this duteous daughter, by ince&s;|&s;ant entreaties, and filial arguments, contrived &s;o far to pacify Charles, as to gain his a&s;&s;ent to an interview with his father; and that this &s;uppo&s;ed cordial might have the greater effect, &s;he introduced Charles imperceptibly, drop|ping on her knee, at the in&s;tant of &s;uch intro|duction, a&s;&s;erting at the &s;ame time that the ble&s;&s;ing of everla&s;ting con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s would at|tend him, if he offered the reconciling hand to his &s;ick and unhappy father.</P>
<P>The reader mu&s;t have noticed it was a fixed maxim of this truly exemplary daughter, that the duty from child to parent can never end, but with the being he gave, or with its own; although &s;he could make a clear di&s;tinction in her mind betwixt the offender and the offence. Her duty to the one, being a parent, was by this pious di&s;tinction as invariable and eternal as her ab|horrence of the other; and &s;he maintained that the father's throwing off either the vir|tues
<PB N="172" REF="181">of the manly or of the paternal character, was no good warrant for renouncing tho&s;e of the filial. On the contrary&mdash;"I will not allow," would &s;he &s;ay to her brother, con|te&s;ting this point during Sir Gui&s;e's &s;ickne&s;s, "I cannot allow, my deare&s;t Charles, that either my &s;ervices or yours admit one mo|ment's relaxation in the whole cour&s;e of our lives. We may deplore, we may avoid, we may even &s;hudder at the conduct of the un|happy parent now brought by that conduct to the &s;ick and &s;orrowing bed. Our filial mini|&s;trations may lo&s;e the &s;weet bloom which u&s;ed to embalm them, while we believed the au|thor of our lives was good, and ju&s;t, and worthy; but a duty is not to die or even to langui&s;h, becau&s;e part of its acompanying delights are taken away. No, Charles&mdash;it &s;hould &s;urvive the grave, and when almo&s;t all our hopes are buried, we &s;hould have a faith|ful memory of our impayable obligations to tho&s;e who &s;upported us in the years of infancy. How often mu&s;t I repeat, that his great guilt &s;hould excite our compa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="173" REF="182">even if it robs us of our tenderne&s;s? and we &s;hould continue from pity what we began from love."</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ometimes by &s;trength and &s;ometimes by &s;oftne&s;s, but ever with &s;incerity, did the charming Caroline plead her own ju&s;tifica|tion, her father's cau&s;e, and win over to his &s;ide even his wor&s;t enemies; at the &s;ame time, after many attempts &s;econded by the good father Arthur, &s;he re&s;i&s;ted the re&s;olves even of the firm Charles, who had fully determined never to &s;ee or hold intercour&s;e with Sir Gui&s;e any more, and who&s;e mind was like his unhappy &s;i&s;ter's, torn by parental di&s;grace, lacerated friend&s;hip, and di&s;appointed love. She found means, however, as we have &s;een, to &s;often the &s;terne&s;t re&s;olutions of Charles; who, partly by her eloquence, partly by the pious remon&s;trances of Arthur, and partly by the natural compa&s;&s;ion of his own heart, was brought, fir&s;t to promi&s;e he would not quit the hou&s;e till his father was in a condition to leave the chamber, then to bear the mention of his name, and la&s;tly to endure the thought of an interview.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="183">But though Caroline had done the very thing Sir Gui&s;e wi&s;hed to have avoided, the latter dared not to &s;hew any repugnance; he therefore attempted to make the be&s;t of a very bad matter. A tale was to be told, and a point gained thereby, which brooked not delay, and this appeared to him a favourable, at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ible, opportunity.</P>
<P>Thus, therefore, the baronet began to ma|nceuvre, "This is more than I expected&mdash;more, perhaps, than I de&s;erve, my children; for you know not the extent of my offences. Great as is your duty, I fear my impru|dence, in one in&s;tance, goes beyond your power to forgive. Know that I have done a deed,&mdash;"&mdash;here a profound &s;igh, mo&s;t likely from his heart&mdash;"a deed!&mdash;how &s;hall I &s;peak of it?" (Another pau&s;e and another &s;igh, heavy almo&s;t to groaning, and not le&s;s &s;incere.) Caroline turned pale, and Arthur, who had followed Charles into the chamber, cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf.&mdash;Charles trembled. "I &s;ay," re&s;umed Sir Gui&s;e, "I have been for &s;ome time&mdash;<HI>&s;ecretly</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e I knew it would di&s;|plea&s;e my children&mdash;."</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="184">"In the name of God! what?" cried Charles.</P>
<P>"Married!" replied Sir Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>"Is that the offence?" quoth Arthur.</P>
<P>"To whom?" que&s;tioned Charles, in terror.</P>
<P>"Since it mu&s;t be known&mdash;nay &s;ince this very hou&s;e, which was in the hour of my weakne&s;s given to my widow for her life&mdash;and as being a woman of a high temper,&mdash;&s;he may in&s;i&s;t on re&s;idence&mdash;"</P>
<P>"This hou&s;e!&mdash;a high temper!&mdash;in&s;i&s;t on re&s;idence!&mdash;Do not di&s;tract me," &s;aid Charles, "but &s;peak."</P>
<P>"Whom&s;oever you have thought fit to make your wife, will of cour&s;e de&s;erve and receive the re&s;pect of your children," &s;aid the trembling Caroline; "for Heaven's &s;ake then, Sir, make us acquainted with the name of the lady we are to con&s;ider as&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;"</P>
<P>The remembrance of her amiable mother impeded her utterance, and it was long be|fore &s;he could fini&s;h her que&s;tion by repeat|ing&mdash;"Whom, &s;ir, are we to con&s;ider as Lady Stuart?"</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="185">"Mrs. TEMPEST," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e.&mdash;He then took &s;helter from the rage that might be expected to follow &s;uch thunder-&s;triking in|telligence under the bed clothes, in which he &s;o muffled him&s;elf, that had the a&s;toni&s;hment and anger of Charles, and the con&s;ternation of Caroline and Arthur, been expre&s;&s;ed with the voice of a lion, they could &s;carcely have been heard.</P>
<P>Caroline was &s;tunned, and Arthur &s;hocked, but both tried to pacify and reconcile Charles to this irremediable circum&s;tance. "Ac|cur&s;ed is he," ob&s;erved the good monk, "who putteth a&s;under man and wife; and although it might be wi&s;hed the&s;e per&s;ons had never come together in holy matrimony, they were now bound by a divine obligation, and it behoved all per&s;ons&mdash;but a &s;on and a daughter in particular&mdash;to&mdash;"</P>
<P>The good man was proceeding in his ha|rangue, every word of which Sir Gui&s;e con|trived to hear, when a vehement clamour a&s;|&s;ailed the ears of the company, as of a per&s;on ru&s;hing up the &s;tairs and exclaiming at every
<PB N="177" REF="186">&s;tep&mdash;"Where, where is he? I will be &s;hut out of my own hou&s;e no longer; tell not me of lieutenants or captains, or &s;ons or daughters; are <HI>their</HI> claims &s;uperior to <HI>mine?</HI> Alas! too long have ye withheld him from me. I will &s;ee him though the congregated earth were to oppo&s;e me. Beat, brui&s;ed, and in bed! Good Heaven!"</P>
<P>And now this vociferous per&s;onage, in de|&s;pite of the remon&s;trances and almo&s;t &s;trength of Denni&s;on, made a forcible entry into the chamber, flew to the bed-&s;ide, caught hold of the &s;ick man's hand, and in a violence which rather overacted the character, called out in all the rant of dramatic affectation, "My love! my life! my hu&s;band!"</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e of &s;o &s;udden an appearance, attended by &s;uch concomitants, did not per|mit the company immediately to recogni&s;e the &s;peaker; and the a&s;toni&s;hment was as much increa&s;ed as it could be, when at la&s;t they per|ceived the new Lady Stuart, who continued to perform her conjugal duties in the &s;ame magnanimous &s;tyle, without &s;eeming to know any third per&s;on was in the room. "How
<PB N="178" REF="187">do you find your&s;elf, my dear hu&s;band? Why did you &s;uffer a fal&s;e delicacy, perhaps, I may call it, an unkind fear of your children, &s;o long to bani&s;h your wife? While you were well, I &s;ubmitted to my hard de&s;tiny, and kept aloof, even immured; I bore the imputation of being a wicked woman, rather than &s;ubject you to cen&s;ure from a &s;on and daughter, who you taught me to believe would treat the woman to whom you gave your hand in holy wedlock, with undutiful &s;everity; but now that I find your precious health is in danger, I bur&s;t through all idle ceremonies, and &s;etting the whole univer&s;e at naught, when in oppo&s;ition to my love and duty, I am come to in&s;i&s;t that you permit me to re|main here, and to offer my &s;hare in your comforts. No; never, never will I quit this roof, this bed, this hand, till you promi&s;e to receive all the &s;ervices I can give; no power on earth &s;hall tear you from me! nor bolts, nor bars, nor chains of iron! I am your wife, Sir Gui&s;e, yes, Sir Gui&s;e, your wedded wife, your true and lawful lady, and who &s;hall dare to bar her way? De&s;truction's in the thought.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="188">She then proceeded to &s;tring rhap&s;odies, collected from different tragedies, with which her memory furni&s;hed her; and, perhaps, Sir Gui&s;e him&s;elf began to think &s;he carried it a little too far, for he emphatically de&s;ired her to &s;top, declaring "&s;he had given him &s;omewhat too much of this.&mdash;"My dear," &s;aid he to Mrs. Tempe&s;t, "meet my be|loved children half-way;" then catching his &s;on's eye, he popped his head again under the clothes.</P>
<P>As in duty bound, his gentle &s;pou&s;e obeyed. She begged pardon for her apparent over|&s;ight, but was convinced her new relatives would make allowances for that overwhelm|ing &s;orrow which they them&s;elves &s;hared too deeply not to account for.</P>
<P>Next, with all po&s;&s;ible conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;he advanced towards Charles and Caroline, and made an offer to embrace them. Father Arthur, in the goodne&s;s of his heart, ear|ne&s;tly promoting it as a fit preliminary of that dome&s;tic harmony he &s;o anxiou&s;ly de|&s;ired to &s;ee take palce: "Embrace, my worthy friends, embrace one another."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="189">The worthy Caroline was &s;o tortured be|tween one &s;en&s;ation and another, that half-willing and half-reluctant, &s;he was ju&s;t &s;tep|ping forward to own Mrs. Tempe&s;t as her father's &s;econd wife, when Charles forcibly pulled her back, grinding between his teeth &s;omething which, in the ears of the lady, &s;ounded like the words&mdash;abandoned woman! touch her not.</P>
<P>"Abandoned!" repeated my Lady, in a thundering accent, which, did we not know the power of &s;udden rage, we &s;hould have thought rather too violent for a lady under her circum&s;tances: "Abandoned!"</P>
<P>"Be not too &s;evere upon the &s;inner," &s;aid Arthur: "I have not the lea&s;t doubt but that now the lady is become the wife of a baronet, and is by this unexpected &s;troke of good fortune brought into a re&s;pectable fa|mily and innocent connections, which is more than &s;he could rea&s;onably have expected&mdash;&s;he will not only quit for ever her former vile way of life, but be wrought to &s;o thorough a &s;en&s;e of that decency and mode&s;ty which be|comes her &s;ex, the pure-minded Mi&s;s Stuart
<PB N="181" REF="190">her&s;elf would not have any more rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of her."</P>
<P>A &s;pectator, le&s;s intere&s;ted in the &s;cene than any of the parties then pre&s;ent, would have been variou&s;ly amu&s;ed at the winks and nods of Sir Gui&s;e, who now peeped from the bed-clothes, to keep down the &s;trong &s;pirit which he &s;aw working in his Lady; and at his &s;igns to Arthur, to hold his peace; but his bride di&s;dained all con&s;iderations and con&s;equences. Rowe has &s;o exactly de&s;cribed her &s;ituation, that you mu&s;t &s;uffer me to bor|row it for your more perfect idea.</P>
<Q><L>At fir&s;t her rage was dumb, and wanted words,</L>

<P>Any attempt to de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of the party, con&s;equent on this harangue, would be pre&s;umptuous ab&s;urdity&mdash;becau&s;e, the tears of Caroline, and the agony of her brother's &s;truggling pa&s;&s;ions, and the foaming madne&s;s of the &s;peaker, and the choaking indignation of father Arthur, and, above all, the unutterable fears of Sir Gui&s;e, who&s;e teeth chattered in his head, would baffle the united talents of Shake&s;peare and Hogarth, and of all the painters and the poets in the world.</P>
<P>Arthur, who fir&s;t recovered &s;peech, declared, after thrice cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, that &s;he was certainly the devil him&s;elf, &s;ent into this world in female &s;hape to puni&s;h Sir Gui&s;e, as a dreadful example to all wicked hypocrites, and that he did not doubt but her feet were cloven.</P>
<P>"Would that my hands were &s;o!" cried &s;he, furiou&s;ly aiming a claw at his ears, which were luckily buried in the bu&s;hine&s;s of his
<PB N="184" REF="193">wig,&mdash;"then," &s;aid &s;he, "there might be &s;ome hope that they would cleave in twain that impudent &s;kull." But, before he had time to reply to this &s;alutation, Charles, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were too often ungovernable, had &s;eized hold of Sir Gui&s;e's arm&mdash;the only part of him that was vi&s;ible, the re&s;t being hid under the bed-clothes&mdash;and beginning to drag him forcibly, exclaimed, in a voice broken with exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;"O thou!&mdash;mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s!&mdash;mo&s;t pitile&s;s!&mdash;Why, why am I and this unhappy girl ince&s;&s;antly to be thus di&s;honoured? And why is it not piety and virtue in a &s;on to relieve his family and the world of &s;uch a &s;courge?"</P>
<P>In a moment Lady Tempe&s;t, Arthur, Ca|roline, and Denni&s;on, whom the clamour had brought into the room, were all employed. The fir&s;t, without any re&s;pect of &s;ex, acted the Amazon, and, oppo&s;ing force to force, tried to di&s;engage the &s;on from the father.</P>
<P>Caroline entreated, yet was &s;o much &s;truck, that her &s;upplications were feeble, and &s;he went weeping out of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="194">Denni&s;on and Arthur drew off Charles by main force into another apartment; and the whole bu&s;ine&s;s concluded by leaving Sir Gui&s;e and his Lady to a conjugal <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te,</HI> which was equally &s;hort and deci&s;ive. It was, how|ever, a curio&s;ity in its kind, and mu&s;t there|fore be recorded.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, Sir Gui&s;e ventured to emerge.</P>
<P>"Aye, you may creep out of your hole, poor trembling wretch&mdash;and a fine hand you have made of it.&mdash;Did not I tell you &s;o?&mdash;You have nothing now but to die in good earne&s;t."</P>
<P>"If you come to that, who was it that over&s;et my plan? But for your damn'd un|rea&s;onable pa&s;&s;ion, and impetuous temper, I had brought you into the hou&s;e, reconciled all parties to you, and we &s;hould have had the abbey to our&s;elves; for the old prie&s;t would have per&s;uaded Charles and the girl to leave us&mdash;in&s;tead of which, I am now in a wor&s;e condition than ever."</P>
<P>"Whatever may be your condition, mine is that of a woman who has the misfortune to
<PB N="186" REF="195">be married to a poltroon, who is afraid to de|fend him&s;elf, or avow his wife! However, here I am, and here I will remain, let who will go or &s;tay, live or die; d&mdash;n me if I don't."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>THE heroic lady having &s;aid this, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon Sir Gui&s;e's getting up and dre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf, ill as he really was&mdash;"yes, and give orders like <HI>a man,</HI>" &s;aid his gentle lady, "to your &s;ervants for the proper reception of, and obedience to your wife." Her yet more gentle lord was too well experienced in his &s;pou&s;e's tempe&s;tuous talents to di&s;pute her commands, and his late mi&s;carriages had &s;o &s;unk his authority, even in his own eyes, that, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing to her the power of the &s;uppo&s;ed lord of the creation, he re&s;igned him|&s;elf, in the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h humility, to what cen|&s;urers have called the weaker ve&s;&s;el&mdash;ju&s;t add|ing, therefore, to his habiliments a pair of &s;tockings and &s;lippers, he ro&s;e out of his &s;ick bed, and almo&s;t lamented, now, with his dear
<PB N="187" REF="196">wife, that it had not proved his dying one. How|ever, he &s;hook him&s;elf, and his rumpled robes, two or three times on feeling him&s;elf once more on <HI>terra firma,</HI> and actually reeled with weakne&s;s and affright. He had, moreover, &s;uffered, from &s;heer di&s;may, his beard to grow to a great length: his hair had been long ne|glected, &s;o that his face was pallid and cada|verous; and he exhibited, at the end of the &s;cene, a haggard, rueful-looking wretch in|deed.</P>
<P>Lady Tempe&s;t, for &s;o, henceforth, though with the greate&s;t reluctance, we are con|&s;trained, by the rights of a <HI>femme covert,</HI> to call her, deemed this no fit object of his be|&s;tirring him&s;elf to the ordering of her lady|&s;hip's arrangements, without any hope of obe|dience following command. She therefore rang the bell, and directed the &s;ervant who an&s;wered it, to &s;end the valet with warm water, and the re&s;t of the Adonizing paraphernalia, taking care to &s;ay it was for the immediate u&s;e of her <HI>hu&s;band</HI> Sir Gui&s;e, who, &s;he &s;aid, was now well enough, thank God! to ri&s;e, and would &s;oon be down &s;tairs. Not any rumour
<PB N="188" REF="197">of the baronet's marriage having reached the abbey kitchen, or indeed any part of the hou&s;e, the &s;ervant who received this me&s;&s;age was &s;carce le&s;s the victim of a&s;toni&s;hment than had been every body above &s;tairs; for neither Charles, Arthur, or Denni&s;on had, as yet, revealed the fre&s;h di&s;grace which the Baronet had brought into the family.</P>
<P>Yielding, therefore, to &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e, who&s;e nature is to &s;tand &s;till, the a&s;toni&s;hed dome&s;tic, who happened to be thus taken unawares, remained fixed at the wonderful word <HI>hu&s;band!</HI> Whereupon, the lady re|peated the orders, with an empha&s;is &s;o thoroughly convincing, that, if &s;he was not the wife, &s;he would henceforward let him know &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e&mdash;the poor fellow took to his heels, &s;carce giving him&s;elf time, or finding breath to &s;tammer out in his exit&mdash;"ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;my mad&mdash;madam."</P>
<P>A &s;econd delay happened in the &s;ervant's hall, where the lady-&s;truck dome&s;tic no &s;ooner arrived, than the threw him&s;elf into the &s;tew|ard's great chair, by way of recovering;
<PB N="189" REF="198">after which he &s;ummoned every adherent of the family, from the under-butler (Denni&s;on being otherwi&s;e employed) to the under|&s;cullion girl, prefacing the news he had to communicate by a &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance, "that it would make every one of them run mad." Then, &s;eeing their mouths all opened wide to &s;wallow the threatened in&s;anity, "Sir Gui&s;e, is mar&mdash;mar&mdash;mar&mdash;married to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to that ra&s;cal Valentine Miles's con&mdash;con&mdash;concu&mdash;concubine! think of that, fellow-&s;ervants!&mdash;and has, more&mdash;moreover, brought his harlot of a wife into the hou&s;e!" "Who?" an&s;wered the corps culinary,&mdash;"that whore of Babylon, Mrs. Tempe&s;t, who &s;educed my dear young lady's young gentleman 'Squire Henry, and gave up her wicked &s;elf to Sir Gui&s;e, and that Valentine, and perhaps half a thou&s;and others?&mdash;Is &s;he to be our mi&s;tre&s;s, and take the place of the good, virtuous, dear, dead and buried lady whom we all followed to the grave, with our hearts ready to break, and willing to do &s;o that we <HI>might</HI> follow her?"</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="199">The grievous reflections which followed the&s;e que&s;tionary exclamations, produced &s;o univer&s;al a groan of the &s;pirit, that it re-echoed through all the dreary and &s;ubter|raneous abodes, and a&s;cended even to the central cupola of the abbey.</P>
<P>Meantime, Lady Tempe&s;t, exa&s;perated at the delay in the performance of her fir&s;t con|jugal commands, re&s;orted to the bell again, with a vehemence that broke part of the wires, and left the ta&s;&s;el in her hand. The ince&s;&s;ant vibrations which preceded this ac|cident had <HI>more</HI> than the de&s;ired effect, for it brought up, not only Sir Gui&s;e's valet, but Denni&s;on and Caroline, who, from habits rather of duty than reflection or &s;entiment, now followed the idea of his being really at his la&s;t ga&s;p. They were &s;oon undeceived, by &s;eeing Sir Gui&s;e walking backwards and forwards about the chamber, and his lady in&s;i&s;ting that every body &s;hould go about their bu&s;ine&s;s, except her hu&s;band's valet. Seeing him among&s;t the crowd that had mechanically obeyed, &s;he drew him towards
<PB N="191" REF="200">her by the profu&s;e neckcloth and chitterling, calling him at the &s;ame time, "a creeping, lazy ra&s;cal;" &s;lapping the door in the faces of the re&s;t, who were thus agreeably repul&s;ed, and were again left to their re|flections on the pro&s;pect of dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>In a word, their &s;orrows at the entrance of their new mi&s;tre&s;s into the abbey almo&s;t equalled that which they felt for the untimely exit of their fir&s;t lady out of it. Indeed, the marriage of the one could be exceeded in cala|mity, only by the burial of the other; and look|ing, as very truly they might, upon Sir Gui&s;e Stuart as the wicked cau&s;e of both mi&s;|fortunes, the &s;ervants came, after &s;ome far|ther con&s;ultation among&s;t one another, to an hone&s;t re&s;olve to &s;ave their character&mdash;that common nece&s;&s;ary of a &s;ervant&mdash;by giving warning, before they could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have received any taint of corrup|tion that might di&s;qualify them for more reputable places. This combination being entered into with &s;pirit, <HI>nem. con.,</HI> many of the dome&s;tics &s;acrificed their month's wages
<PB N="192" REF="201">and took them&s;elves away on the in&s;tant, others dropt off occa&s;ionally, and at the end of the month, the kitchen was emptied even down to a poor limping dwarf, who acted under the &s;cullion as a &s;ort of human turn&s;pit; but who, being a&s;&s;ured that his good name, and of cour&s;e his good bread, was in imminent danger, hopped away with his brown paper bundle of property, to &s;ave his reputation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mover of all this was Robert Irwin the cook, and his wife the dairy-woman. The troubled valet having fini&s;hed his part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;embruting his ma&s;ter, and certain other ablutions being performed, Sir Gui&s;e, in the cour&s;e of two hours, was humanized, and the &s;uits and ceremonies of &s;ickne&s;s, pain and death, being thrown a&s;ide, though he had really &s;uffered &s;everely in body and in mind, yet he was &s;till much better in health than any other of his family.</P>
<P>The unhappy Caroline and her brother pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in the company of the good Arthur and the con&s;oling Denni&s;on, but they were in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery too &s;evere to decide what cour&s;e to take. In a retro&s;pect of her
<PB N="193" REF="202">father's cour&s;e of life, which the late occur|rences had more e&s;pecially forced upon her, Caroline &s;aw a dreadful hi&s;tory of the pa&s;t, and an in&s;upportable pro&s;pect of the future. Her uncorrupted nature &s;huddered at the view. So far was &s;he from &s;uffering de&s;truc|tion of that moral principle, which not only guided her actions, but governed her very thoughts, that &s;he admitted not the &s;lighte&s;t deprivation of it in her&s;elf, nor could her penetrating mind di&s;cover it in another, though but an acquaintance, without great pain. How aggravated then mu&s;t have been this nice &s;en&s;e of rectitude, when &s;he re|flected upon the utter extinction of every thing like a moral principle in her father; who&s;e conduct had &s;o often covered her in|nocent cheek with blu&s;hes, as if her own pure heart had, unwittingly, done &s;omething which produced and de&s;erved the di&s;grace of her family?</P>
<P>Charles thought, in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs, it would be a right mea&s;ure, to expel the ba&s;e intruder who had trepanned their father into a marriage&mdash;but this was overruled
<PB N="194" REF="203">both by Caroline and Arthur, who in&s;i&s;ted, that no man living could, with a &s;afe con|&s;cience, divide man and wife, while they con&s;ented to live together.</P>
<P>Caroline propo&s;ed that the abbey &s;hould be left to the unhappy couple, and &s;ome place of e&s;cape be &s;ought for us, "no matter where," cried &s;he, with a trembling voice&mdash;"Alas! I have done with choice, &s;ave that I feel it nece&s;|&s;ary to remove hence, &s;ince the thoughts of another Lady Stuart, even were &s;he better en|titled to that precious, regretted name, than my father's pre&s;ent wife&mdash;would be too much, with other deep loads, upon my heart;&mdash;O, it would be too much for me to bear&mdash;as I ought."&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;poke, or rather &s;obbed out the la&s;t words on her tender brother's bo&s;om. While the virtuous youth feeling the &s;tring jarred, on which hung his own mi&s;ery, too much like his &s;i&s;ter's, in nature as in degree, em|braced her with all the &s;ympathies of affec|tion and of woe. Denni&s;on held down his dejected head and ki&s;&s;ed their hands, with mi&s;ery inferior only to their own; and the pious, gentle-hearted Arthur called upon
<PB N="195" REF="204">the protection of that Power he adored &s;o truly, and wept aloud; after which, circling his arms around them, as if to afford a &s;helter, he cried out, "There is a good and ju&s;t Providence, my children, who will take care of us all."</P>
<P>Charles however, re&s;olving that neither him&s;elf nor his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould pa&s;s another night under the &s;ame roof with Sir Gui&s;e and his con&s;ort, the monk, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, exclaimed in a rapture, as at the acqui&s;ition of a lucky idea&mdash;"Ye may &s;ojourn at the chapel-hou&s;e, my children, for a few days, till we &s;ee what is be&s;t to be done. There is room for four quiet people who love each other; I include friend Denni&s;on in the number&mdash;yes, there is &s;pace enough to be happy, and though we fare not as the dwellers at the abbey, in what are called the good things of life, we &s;hall there e&s;cape abundance of the wor&s;t, the &s;trife and di&s;content, which will &s;urely be found among&s;t the inmates of tho&s;e we leave be|hind us in this lordly man&s;ion&mdash;and as to
<PB N="196" REF="205">attendants, fear not our being tolerably &s;erved. I am my&s;elf not a bad cook, and my Indian boy is both diligent and know|ing."</P>
<P>"As to that matter," quoth Denni&s;on, &s;eeming as if &s;uddenly to have recovered his youth, "my young lady and ma&s;ter and your reverence can tell I can be&s;tir my&s;elf upon occa&s;ion, and do not doubt but I &s;hall have every thing prepared in the little chapel-hou&s;e and in &s;uch good order, that the old furniture &s;hall give a &s;hining welcome, before we have been twenty-four hours its inhabitants."</P>
<P>While they were di&s;cour&s;ing thus, a &s;er|vant brought down word from the new mi&s;|tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, that Sir Gui&s;e and her Lady&s;hip de&s;ired to dine private that day, and to pa&s;s the evening by them&s;elves, pre|vious to certain family arrangements which they intended in future to make, and which, when properly dige&s;ted, &s;hould be pre&s;ented to them, to the end, that, whatever rules the <HI>principal</HI> thought fit to lay down, might
<PB N="197" REF="206">be adopted, and pa&s;s unque&s;tioned into do|me&s;tic laws. Charles and Caroline were therefore to give orders for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This imperious me&s;&s;age, which every one of the family &s;ervants refu&s;ed to carry, was brought by one of her Lady&s;hip's own do|me&s;tics, who, within the la&s;t hour, had called with di&s;patches from Valentine Miles.</P>
<P>Father Arthur, impo&s;ing &s;ilence on Charles, returned for an&s;wer, that neither he, nor his children, for &s;o he often called Charles and Caroline, were &s;urprized at the de&s;ire expre&s;&s;ed by Sir Gui&s;e to keep out of &s;ight, and that as it was probable certain arrange|ments below &s;tairs&mdash;meaning tho&s;e of his own party at the chapel-hou&s;e&mdash;would take place before tho&s;e in agitation above; he, for his part, would advi&s;e them to turn their &s;tudies from the laws of eating and drinking to tho&s;e of fa&s;ting and prayer, and all the other laws in&s;tituted and appointed for the u&s;e and performance of wicked &s;in|ners who were de&s;irous to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant was &s;carce departed, before the monk pre&s;ented one hand to Caroline,
<PB N="198" REF="207">the other to Charles, beckoning Denni&s;on, with a &s;mile, to bring up the rear.</P>
<P>"Come, my dear children, let us remove with all convenient di&s;patch out of the ha|bitation of guilt, mi&s;ery, and hardened in&s;o|lence, and &s;eek refuge in that decent, un|obtru&s;ive abode, where peace, honour, inno|cence, and the merits of a life pure and un|defiled, await to receive us."</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition was accepted by Charles, becau&s;e he felt that his longer continuance at the abbey would probably be attended by events too dire to name; by Caroline, be|cau&s;e her poor heart was bowed by &s;orrows too manifold and mighty to re&s;i&s;t or to make any lection for her&s;elf; and by Denni&s;on, becau&s;e the good old man, as he lived at the abbey only to be of &s;ervice to his young lady and ma&s;ter, &s;o he wi&s;hed to pa&s;s the re&s;idue of his blamele&s;s days where&s;oever their fate or fortune, their happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, &s;hould carry them. Orders being, therefore, given to Charles's man and Caroline's woman to pack up, and bring their different trunks and other baggage after them&mdash;they &s;et out
<PB N="199" REF="208">in the manner above de&s;cribed, for their &s;mall but comfortable dwelling.</P>
<P>They had gone about half way, when Ca|roline &s;topped &s;uddenly, and declared &s;he had left &s;omething, which none of the keys given to her woman could di&s;clo&s;e, and which as none but her&s;elf could find, &s;he mu&s;t beg the delay of a few minutes while &s;he returned for it, ob&s;erving that &s;he &s;hould be wretched in the extreme to know it was in the abbey after her bani&s;hment! Without waiting any reply, &s;he ran back as fa&s;t as her delicate limbs could carry her, and in about a quar|ter of an hour returned, breathle&s;s, and bathed in tears, yet with a &s;miling countenance, de|claring, that &s;he was much ea&s;ier for what &s;he had brought out of the hou&s;e, though &s;he had the misfortune to meet the &s;trange lady in her way, and heard her a&s;k &s;ome|body, ju&s;t as &s;he entered, whether Mi&s;s too was of the run-away party? "Yet, do not think, my dear Charles, it was an improper or trifling errand that could make me detain you thus long on the road. No; it was
<PB N="200" REF="209">for what my brother will e&s;teem no le&s;s than my&s;elf&mdash;this precious&mdash;precious picture of her&mdash;who&mdash;O! my God! what a change! what an alteration has this &s;econd marriage made in that abbey, which could once boa&s;t of the angel whom this little miniature&mdash;in her mortality, &s;carcely mortal&mdash;re&s;embled! and on who&s;e honoured head the&s;e tre&s;&s;es once grew!"</P>
<P>Turning the picture&mdash;&s;he exclaimed, "O! my ever beloved and ever lamented mother! how wilt thou forgive him this la&s;t, this greate&s;t of his offences?"</P>
<P>As if jealous and fearful of again parting with it, even for a moment, and to a loving brother who yet &s;eemed wi&s;hing to pay it homage, &s;he took it from her own lips warmed with the &s;en&s;ations of her filial heart, and pre&s;&s;ed it upon his: while Arthur, who never &s;uffered the mourner to &s;orrow alone when he was at hand, broke forth into tho&s;e moving &s;entiments of Hamlet &s;o truly ap|plying to the pre&s;ent picture;
<Q>That it &s;hould come to this!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="210">The&s;e and other reflections, in the &s;ame train of &s;olemn thought, were interrupted, ju&s;t as the little chapel-hou&s;e appeared in view. It was opened by Irwin the cook, the footmen, and all the maid and men &s;ervants of the family, who, under&s;tanding from the young lady's woman, left in care of the baggage, that Charles and his &s;i&s;ter, with the old &s;teward, were leaving the abbey, and as the woman told them, never to return, but to live at the chapel-hou&s;e till they could &s;uit them&s;elves, had come, in a body, like volunteers, to offer their poor but hone&s;t &s;ervices to their honoured young ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. They prote&s;ted their humble love and duty with a fervour that denoted their &s;incerity. One declared, he would &s;erve their worthy honours and the good Mr. Denni&s;on by night and by day, far and near, all the world over.&mdash;"Nay as to that," &s;aid another "you know, William, we had rather a thou&s;and times pa&s;s our whole lives with &s;ome good gentry in hard labour, without fee or reward, than with Sir
<PB N="202" REF="211">Gui&s;e and his good-for-nothing Madam for half his fortune." They then, with one voice, &s;upplicated to be received; declaring, that they had all a little modicum hoarded up and got in their late good Lady's days, and which would keep them in comfort, without wages, till it plea&s;ed God to bring things about a little; "and for that matter, we had all of us," exclaimed Irwin, "re|&s;olved among&s;t our&s;elves, to leave our pre|&s;ent place before we knew of your worthy honours quitting the abbey; but now we have nothing left there to make us amends for what we &s;uffer&mdash;our poor, dear, true, and virtuous Lady Stuart is dead and gone, and another woman, not fit to be named with her, or with any Chri&s;tian woman, is put into our poor Lady's place, the abbey is no ab|bey for us, and we will not &s;tay to do ano|ther hand's turn!&mdash;So pray, good, dear your honours, let us follow and abide with you, go where you may. Do, your Reverence, and Mr. Denni&s;on," continued Irwin, "&s;peak a word for us&mdash;pray, pray do, and bid young
<PB N="203" REF="212">my Lady and the "Squire con&s;ider, that we were all in the family when the true Lady Stuart was alive, and followed her to the grave when &s;he was dead, and we are &s;ure her &s;oul would not re&s;t in heaven, where for certain it is gone, if &s;he knew the doings that were now at the abbey, and that her poor old &s;ervants &s;taid in the hou&s;e when her ble&s;&s;ed &s;on and daughter were in a manner turned out of it."</P>
<P>The voice of natural eloquence &s;eldom pleads in vain, for it generally is exerted in the cau&s;e of genuine and unaffected good|ne&s;s. This unexpected appeal, however, pro|duced &s;ome generous embarra&s;&s;ment. The affections were &s;trongly touched, but the little chapel-hou&s;e would &s;carce have held the &s;upplicants, and as that, in the pre&s;ent moment of indeci&s;ion, was literally to be the re&s;ting place, &s;uch a retinue would be in|con&s;i&s;tent with their decent and unobtru&s;ive plan of life; father Arthur, therefore, putting on the arch &s;mile which reconciled every thing in a moment, ob&s;erved, that the cha|pel it&s;elf would be barely &s;ufficient to the
<PB N="204" REF="213">purpo&s;es of the accommodation of his own little family, though he would readily give up his monk's bed to them, as a reward for the honourable feelings, which mu&s;t have dictated their offer of &s;ervice.&mdash;"And me woud give mine, ma&s;&s;er," cried Flore&s;co, his Indian boy, who had joined the company as he &s;aw them gathered together&mdash;"yes, ma&s;&s;er, me would give my ickle bed, and make up anoder wis my warm blankey and &s;hawl, I brought out of my country, if ma&s;|&s;er will let good hearts peoples come and live wis us, and we'll be &s;o merry and &s;o glad."</P>
<P>"Aye, my noble child of the &s;un, which, I &s;ee, has taught your heart to glow like his own beams, but here is a whole congrega|tion you &s;ee."&mdash;</P>
<P>Charles was greatly moved, Caroline ex|perienced emotions peculiar to her charac|ter&mdash;they were compo&s;ed of the tenderne&s;s of her heart and the firmne&s;s of her &s;oul&mdash;and &s;he &s;ettled the bu&s;ine&s;s, by a&s;&s;uring the petitioners, that if they went back to the abbey, and gave proper notice of their in|tentions
<PB N="205" REF="214">to quit their &s;ervice, but without en|tering into any improper explanations, &s;o that all might be done with decency and or|der, they would probably find her at the chapel hou&s;e; at lea&s;t obtain her addre&s;s there, &s;hould &s;he have left it; and they might de|pend on her be&s;t &s;ervices and tho&s;e of her brother to &s;ettle them reputably and com|fortably in new &s;ituations. Father Arthur, Charles, and Denni&s;on, giving their fulle&s;t &s;anction to this mea&s;ure, the groupe were per&s;uaded to turn back, after receiving the honour to &s;hake the hand of the gentleman, and to ki&s;s that of the young lady. The next morning, however, Robert Irwin contrived to &s;end his &s;weetheart, Margaret, one of the chamber-maids, with a ba&s;ket with the be&s;t things of his larder, and though all the&s;e were rejected and returned, as coming from the abbey, the motive with which they were ten|dered was not forgotten.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE a&s;&s;iduous Flore&s;co opened the chapel-hou&s;e door; and Arthur, who to the gravity of a monk adjoined the courte&s;y of a man fa&s;hioned by courts, with a ho&s;pitable &s;mile gave that &s;mile in welcome, and by the endearing names of friends and children, had entreated his little train to enter in and be at peace.</P>
<P>But one of the dome&s;tics returned in ha&s;te, and pre&s;ented a little packet to Caroline: "I fancy, Mi&s;s, this mu&s;t have been dropt by your Lady&s;hip, as this &s;lip of a card was found with it, and William the footman, who is a &s;cholar, &s;ays he knows it is a <HI>piegram</HI> or <HI>cro&s;s &s;tick,</HI> which means rhyming ver&s;es made upon letters in ladies' names, or &s;ome &s;uch <HI>gonundrum;</HI> and &s;ee, Mi&s;s, it begins with C, and ends, lookee, with E, which William &s;ays makes out Caroline, which to be &s;ure is your Lady&s;hip, God ble&s;s you, and plea&s;e your honour; there it is, Mi&s;s&mdash;and I will now go to fellow-&s;ervants, who are a waiting for me o' the wood-&s;ide."</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="216">Caroline had begun to outglow the ri|band that bound the packet, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, and the hue of confe&s;&s;ion increa&s;ed and &s;pread to &s;uch a degree before the &s;ervant had done &s;peaking, that when &s;he received it, her whole frame atte&s;ted it was a matter of great importance, coming at &s;uch a moment: "'Tis nothing but a&mdash;nothing," &s;aid &s;he, "but a&mdash;&s;mall&mdash;little bit&mdash;of&mdash;paper&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;a&mdash;kind of&mdash;and&mdash;a&mdash;which you,&mdash;brother,&mdash;you know&mdash;de&s;ired me&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to take care of for you."</P>
<P>As Caroline's head, heart, and voice, con|federated to betray, were all fluttering at once, the di&s;covery of her &s;ituation was threefold; for while her delicate fingers were, as &s;he thought, tightening the riband round the paper, they, in reality, were loo&s;ening it at every turn, and being thus detached, a little engine of mighty power, in ca&s;es of affection, known by the name of a locket, dropt from the paper, and was caught on its way to the ground by Charles, who in&s;tantly recogni&s;ed what it was, to whom it belonged, and from whence it came.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="217">That the reader may be in the &s;ecret al&s;o, he is to under&s;tand, that this locket, contain|ing a braid of Henry's hair, was, in the hap|pier days of Henry and Caroline's intercour&s;e, and yet when there had happened one of tho&s;e &s;light yet delicious differences which &s;weeten agreement, given to their mutual friend Charles; to the end that it &s;hould find its way, by that medium, into Caroline's bo&s;om, where the kind Charles took care it &s;hould repo&s;e &s;hortly after; and he watched his op|portunity &s;o well, that he procured for it that enviable re&s;ting-place in the cour&s;e of the very day it was pre&s;ented, and could it have known its happine&s;s, "right proud would it have been of its lodging." It was a token of reconcilement; and as Caroline, then un|der the influence of tho&s;e hopes, which an innocent pa&s;&s;ion, and the fir&s;t of the heart, believed, as all lovers do, every thing po&s;&s;i|ble, or more truly &s;peaking to the &s;weet ex|travagance of the affections, impo&s;&s;ibilities probable, &s;he <HI>looked a vow</HI> as &s;he tied that very riband round her neck, which had lately bound the paper, then fa&s;tened to the locket,
<PB N="209" REF="218">that neither time, nor chance, nor aught but the di&s;&s;olving power of death, &s;hould rob her of that tali&s;manic offering.</P>
<P>A cruel combination of circum&s;tances, inexorable as death it&s;elf, ever &s;ince that fatal hour, which extingui&s;hed every tender hope, had made her take it, with a trem|bling hand, from its lovely man&s;ion: Yet tenderne&s;s like hers &s;urvives even the ex|tinction of hope, and manife&s;ts it&s;elf, perhaps mo&s;t firmly, in the moment of de&s;pair. Her ultimate de&s;ign was to return it by the medium &s;he received it; in the meantime &s;he looked upon it as a &s;acred property in tru&s;t, and deemed it worthy a place in the little &s;anctuary where her mother's picture and other reliques of the heart were depo&s;ited. Nay, &s;he had carefully put them not only into the &s;ame drawer, but bound them to|gether in the &s;ame paper, as fit companions for each other, &s;eparating them only &s;ince &s;he brought them from the abbey, perhaps to avoid the di&s;covery, which, putting them as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed in different pockets, pro|duced.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="219">As the locket remained in the hand of Charles, Caroline ca&s;t a look fir&s;t upon it, and then upon her brother, which was clearly under&s;tood by both; and perhaps by the whole company, to imply, "Alas! It is ours no longer. It is the property of Olivia, and mu&s;t be re&s;igned to the donor, with a &s;ecret injunction, to remember the friend&s;hip of Charles, but to forget the love of Caro|line!" Some &s;uch &s;ympathy mu&s;t have &s;truck the brother and &s;i&s;ter at this cri&s;is, for, as if &s;uffering on the &s;ame &s;entiment, they ran into each other's embraces, con&s;oling and commi&s;erating one another.</P>
<P>Arthur &s;aw the dilemma was of a &s;ingular kind, but had yet no clear idea of its cau&s;e: Charles, unwilling to deprive his &s;i&s;ter of the locket, and Caroline reluctant to part with, yet re&s;olved not to keep it longer in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a train of objections having by this time mu&s;tered them&s;elves; Arthur ex|claimed, "My dear children, entru&s;t this to my charge, till it &s;uits with the time to re|claim or re&s;tore it. It &s;hall be pre&s;erved as a relique of innocence, &s;en&s;ibility, and
<PB N="211" REF="220">adver&s;ity; the &s;evere, but &s;alutary &s;chool in which tho&s;e gifts of heaven are be&s;t taught."</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een the gentle Caroline, earne&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of a &s;mall unorna|mented miniature of her mother, and of a &s;imple braid of Henry's hair, and to re&s;cue them from the &s;acrilege of that plunder which might be expected from the new Lady Stuart; and, in &s;hort, jealous in her care of two precious trifles of nothing worth to the un|feeling heart, while &s;he abandoned her pearls, jewels, and other attractive ornaments, which have charms for many of her &s;ex, without be&s;towing a thought on what might become of them; and this would have been the ca&s;e had every drawer been filled with gems of Golconda.</P>
<P>And now they all entered the chapel-hou&s;e, where, by the &s;oothing attentions of Denni|&s;on father Arthur, and his good little "white-hearted blackamoor," as he u&s;ed to call him, in the cour&s;e of the evening they recovered a more con&s;iderable portion of their tranquil|lity, in the habitation of a poor monk, than
<PB N="212" REF="221">could have been expected, in the mo&s;t &s;pendid apartments of the lofty man&s;ion from who&s;e vicious influence their virtue had e&s;caped.</P>

<P>THEY had remained at the chapel-hou&s;e &s;ome days, and, by the mingled powers of &s;ympathy, holy friend&s;hip, and unaffected communications with the Author of comfort, by the medium of his zealous and upright mini&s;ter father Arthur, had found relief, when one evening, ju&s;t as they had fini&s;hed a twilight conver&s;ation, the purport of which was their yet-undetermined &s;cheme of life, the bell of death, from the church of Fitzorton, a&s;&s;ailed their ears&mdash;</P>

<P><PB N="213" REF="222">True George, with a countenance like that which drew "old Priam's curtains in the dead of night," came charged with a letter to Charles, containing the following words&mdash;</P>
<P>"O Charles! my father is no more!&mdash;His &s;oul has taken with him to heaven my oath&mdash;an oath ratified by my lips on the book of life, and given in the dying moment of the be&s;t of fathers&mdash;to become the hu&s;band of Oli|via. Yes, dear, unhappy one! to marry her, &s;o &s;oon as the decent forms of &s;epulture will permit. My rebel heart delayed giving this fatal bond till he appeared to be in the la&s;t extremity. I could not endure to embitter a period &s;o agonizing and awful. I gave up my&s;elf, you, and even Caroline, to the ea&s;e of an expiring parent. Alas! my friend, the Author of my being &s;poke to me, methought, on the border of eternity: he appeared to me, then, &s;carcely an inhabitant of this earth, and the voice with which he implored a &s;on to ble&s;s a dying father, &s;ounded as if it came from heaven. Trembling, I gave the fatal affirmation;&mdash;I dared, in that deep moment of lacerated nature, in which my &s;oul &s;eemed,
<PB N="214" REF="223">like Sir Armine's, prepared to leave this world, and all its hopes and fears&mdash;I dared to promi&s;e that I would give my pro&s;ti|tute hand to the beloved of my friend, and prove a traitor to my heart's former vows to &mdash;. Oh! fill up the &s;pace with the name of one precious to thy friend as Olivia is to thee; and tell me how this double duty, or this double violation&mdash;this infidelity to one, and hypocri&s;y to another&mdash;an hypocri&s;y, too, which is to la&s;t for life,&mdash;ah! it may be a long, mi&s;erable, mournful life&mdash;are to be re|conciled! To you only I can, I dare appeal. John is more awful than &mdash;. Forget that thou art the &s;on of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, and &s;peak to me as the friend of my youth, the partner of my few joys, the depo&s;it of my many &s;orrows. Dying, my father &s;eparated your name from the name of him that gave it you; and reque&s;ted the good Charles might be told he knew how to love and pity him. Olivia too, dear, un&s;u&s;picious girl, then kneel|ing at the &s;ide of his bed, intreated he would extend his ble&s;&s;ing, his pity, and his love, to one no le&s;s de&s;erving of them.&mdash;'O thou
<PB N="215" REF="224">be&s;t of innocents,' cried Sir Armine, pre&s;&s;ing her &s;oliciting hands to his quivering lip, and ca&s;ting at me a look which my bleeding heart interpreted, 'I do bequeath Caroline Stuart all thou require&s;t, and, next to thy&s;elf, the report of her virtues are neare&s;t to me. Cir|cum&s;tances, my dear child, may &s;o fall out&mdash;for the world I am leaving teems with hourly revolution&mdash;that one day thou maye&s;t contrive to impart to her my benediction without pain to thy&s;elf or others.' Another interpretable look was here addre&s;&s;ed to me; and the artle&s;s Olivia, who, without being able to con&s;true it, fervently exclaimed, 'She hoped he would live to be him&s;elf the bearer of his ble&s;&s;ing, and that, for her part, &s;he did not believe even Henry's &s;ociety could make her quite happy without that of the &s;uffering Caroline. 'But,' added &s;he, taking my hand, 'I am &s;ure his own heart will incline to indulge me in this in&s;tance. Will you not, my deare&s;t Henry, promi&s;e Sir Armine that you will imitate his father's almo&s;t divine goodne&s;s in making di|&s;tinctions betwixt the wicked and virtuous of the &s;ame family?' One may better &s;upport
<PB N="216" REF="225">undue &s;everity than an exce&s;s of unmerited kindne&s;s. Why do not the never-ending vir|tues of this exalted woman &s;often my &s;oul-felt e&s;teem to heart-felt fondne&s;s? O thou re|cently-departed &s;pirit of my dear father! in|tercede with thy now a&s;&s;ociate angels; yea, with thy God, to infu&s;e new love into my heart; or, intercede with that Fountain of Love, to relea&s;e me from an oath which fal&s;i|fies the pa&s;&s;ion that feeds upon my life! How can I &s;upport this pitile&s;s &s;torm, which rages on every &s;ide? How could that dear parent give it birth?&mdash;O! my friend, the tyranny of Olivia's virtues oppre&s;s me almo&s;t to mad|ne&s;s. They touch me with enthu&s;ia&s;m&mdash;they animate my whole frame,&mdash;they throb at every pul&s;e, and every nerve of my &s;oul atte&s;ts their power. But the heart, my friend, the heart, in the mid&s;t of all this, is cold, in&s;en|&s;ible, uninfluenced, unin&s;pired. Alas! it is another's!&mdash;O! did&s;t thou know this, my Olivia, thou would&s;t more than pardon&mdash;thou would&s;t pity me, and, &s;o well do I know thy tender nature, would&s;t become a willing &s;a|crifice.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="226">"The continued excellence, Charles, of this young woman, to my father, to me, and to all of us, &s;trengthens her claims, and adds to the infinity of my de&s;pair&mdash;for my heart is &s;till undivided, uncontrolled, and &s;till is Ca|roline unrivalled there. Behold me at once the victim of gratitude and love.</P>
<P>"To detail the &s;cenes I have pa&s;t &s;ince la&s;t I wrote would be impo&s;&s;ible. Have you any thing to propo&s;e by which I may e&s;cape an event, that, though chained by the mo&s;t &s;olemn but coercive bonds, I dare not think upon?

Why did I ever behold her?&mdash;Yet I ble&s;s my de&s;troyer! How &s;hall I commit my dear fa|ther's body to the grave? The bell at this moment tells the rich, the poor, and all who have heard his name, and felt the influence
<PB N="218" REF="227">of his virtues, that their companion, bene|factor, patron, and common parent, is this very night to be clo&s;ed in the cold vault.</P>
<P>"A cruel accident was the immediate cau&s;e of his death! But Sir Gui&s;e&mdash;O that he were not the father of my friend! I will add no more!&mdash;Olivia, my agonized brothers, my afflicted James, and the &s;ubdued John, death-like in looks, as in &s;ilence, yet &s;oft as love when tho&s;e looks are directed to us, and Partington, forgetful of all his &s;ingularities, and weeping like a &s;tricken babe, are gathered together around the venerable corp&s;e, &s;urvey|ing his lifele&s;s face.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t as I was about to quit the room, I thought I beheld the &s;mile which my, alas! ex|torted obedience impre&s;&s;ed on every feature, and made him die happy. How am I involved in the depths of mi&s;ery! and what a calamity is even my re&s;pite from the&s;e oath-bound nuptials? For is it not derived from the death of the noble&s;t of men, and deare&s;t, be&s;t of fathers? I write in this de&s;olate hour to &s;ave my&s;elf from, perhaps, greater de&s;olation.

<P>EVERY pa&s;&s;ion of his friend's &s;oul was arou&s;ed by the peru&s;al of this letter; which having read, he put into the trembling hand of his &s;i&s;ter, exclaiming, "Our ordeal is not yet over&mdash;Sir Armine Fitzorton is pa&s;&s;ing from the ca&s;tle to the tomb."</P>
<P>He then conferred apart with the bearer of the letter, and informed Arthur and Den|ni&s;on with the contents; while Caroline was left the victim of &s;ome inde&s;cribable emo|tions, excited by every &s;entence&mdash;for every &s;entence had its appropriate pang.&mdash;She often pau&s;ed, and every pau&s;e was filled with the di&s;mal bell that &s;till rang out for the father of her &s;oul-beloved Henry.

She walked with Charles by the light of the moon, and, in&s;en&s;ibly taking the path which led from the chapel-hou&s;e to the chapel, &s;he &s;topped at the porch of the latter.</P>
<P>"Sole &s;upport of our fallen family!" &s;aid &s;he, "and only hope of an unhappy &s;i&s;ter! honour me in this heart-&s;earching cri&s;is of both our lives with your attention.

I blu&s;h not, O thou that ha&s;t adorned the being I love with every virtue of the human heart, and every grace of the human form! I blu&s;h not before thee to avow the affection which thou ha&s;t thy&s;elf in&s;pired; and I withdraw my&s;elf, under thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance, only to promote his good, prevent the evil which my abiding longer in his
<PB N="225" REF="234">&s;ight would bring upon him, and, in the humble hope that my uncea&s;ing prayers for his temporal and eternal happine&s;s will be heard."</P>
<P>During this ejaculation, Charles paid the tribute of a tear to the virtuous di&s;tre&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter, of whom his heart was proud, and of whom he determined to prove him&s;elf worthy. He interrupted not her pious rhap&s;ody, but when &s;he had ended it, gently pre&s;&s;ed her hand, as they walked on, &s;ilently meditating the important ta&s;k they had undertaken. The moon &s;uddenly became clouded, yet they continued to walk arm wreathed in arm, as if to bring their de&s;igns into arrange|ment.</P>
<P>They were in that profound occupation of the mind, whereof the body has no &s;hare, whereof, indeed, even the faculties of the mind are excluded, &s;ave the one godlike faculty of virtuous fortitude, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed, in a ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent, to emulate two young people, &s;ummoned on a great occa|&s;ion to yield up the deare&s;t part of them&s;elves to another, and to confirm the mutual &s;acri|fice,
<PB N="226" REF="235">by &s;ome act which &s;hall put it beyond their <HI>own</HI> power to retract their engagement, &s;hould even the &s;educing weakne&s;s of the heart at any time convene the relap&s;ing pa&s;|&s;ions to repent of what they had done. Un|der &s;uch ab&s;orbing employment of the &s;oul, the motions of the body are wholly mechani|cal; we are carried we know not whither, for neither time, nor &s;pace, can then be mea|&s;ured. In this &s;ituation were Caroline and Charles; their feet had wandered from the track, and followed a direct contrary path; they found them&s;elves, at length, in that which led to Fitzorton church. The moment that &s;ucceeded this di&s;covery, pre&s;ented to their view the &s;olemn light of funeral torches, and ere they were aware of it, they perceived them&s;elves at the gate of the church-yard, where the hear&s;e had &s;topped, and its &s;acred depo&s;it, Sir Armine's corp&s;e, was ju&s;t lifted on the &s;houlders of &s;ix of his &s;ervants, as he had ordered. "O gracious Heaven!" whi&s;|pered Caroline; "whither, Charles, have our devious &s;teps beguiled us? Alas! to the grave of Sir Armine."&mdash;"Even &s;o," an|&s;wered
<PB N="227" REF="236">Charles, retreating &s;ome few paces. They ha&s;tily walked into a remote path of the church-yard, while the proce&s;&s;ion kept its way to the burial-place of the Fitzortons. "Ah God!" exclaimed Caroline to Charles, "I di&s;cover Henry among&s;t the mourners:" "And there, clo&s;e at his &s;ide," replied Charles, "is Olivia, &s;upporting her weeping father with one hand, and receiving the &s;upport of Henry with the other, leaning for his help."&mdash;In one moment they both forgot they had been making re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>As the bearers gained the porch of the church, and the multitude followed in decent &s;orrow, Charles and Caroline pa&s;&s;ed in the train undi&s;tingui&s;hed, and were as &s;incere mourners as any of the a&s;&s;embly. They felt them&s;elves involved in the public calamity, to which they had &s;till their &s;u&s;picions that their own father had been acce&s;&s;ary. Hold|ing down their humiliated heads from the oppo&s;ite pre&s;&s;ures of grief, &s;hame, and fear of di&s;covery, they went with the lamenting multitude into the church. Forgetting all modes of faith, they joined with the fervour of
<PB N="228" REF="237">devotion in that &s;ublime form of prayer ap|pointed in the prote&s;tant &s;ervice for the burial of the dead.</P>
<P>The widowed matron, the venerable Clare, the &s;weet and mourning Olivia, and the three heart-united brothers, were arranged on one &s;ide of the body; Partington with the whole family of the poor Atwoods on the other. The hou&s;ehold &s;ervants, the gentry of the neighbourhood, and all the trade&s;men and tenants of the decea&s;ed, were gathered into di&s;tinct groupes within view of the coffin, and a mixed multitude filled not only every other part of the church, but the church-yard, &s;o that every grave and tomb-&s;tone was loaded with living &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The vault of the Fitzortons lay in the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the church, bordering the &s;teps of the altar. The coffin was &s;lowly mov|ing towards it, when Caroline, carried forci|bly along by the pre&s;s of the too eager mul|titude, lo&s;t the hitherto protecting arm of her brother, and was driven forward even within &s;ight of the chief mourners. The &s;olemn re&s;ignation of du&s;t to du&s;t was at
<PB N="229" REF="238">this in&s;tant pronouncing by the prie&s;t; the &s;exton proceeded to clo&s;e the vault, and the a&s;&s;embly di&s;per&s;ed&mdash;Henry remained&mdash;"Stop, for pity's &s;ake, &s;top one moment," exclaimed he, "di&s;regard me not, good friends, but as you honoured the dead, and love the living, I conjure you leave me to my&s;elf."&mdash;Then finding him&s;elf obeyed, and the &s;exton &s;u&s;|pending his office, he kneeled down, bowing his head to the vault, and cla&s;ping his hands forcibly together, remained mute. Olivia and Lady Fitzorton, overwhelmed by exce&s;s of grief, had been led away, by Partington and Mr. Clare, from the &s;cene they could no longer &s;upport.</P>
<P>An action &s;o characteri&s;tic of the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of Henry had a too powerful effect on Caroline, who&s;e tenderne&s;s and terror of heart proved, in this one in&s;tance, too pow|ful for the firmne&s;s of her &s;oul. She &s;prang forward, exclaiming, "O God! O God!" as &s;he pronounced which words &s;he perceived Henry Fitzorton. He &s;tarted at the well-known &s;ound of her voice, and caught her in his arms. Her face being concealed by her
<PB N="230" REF="239">po&s;ture, and mo&s;t of the congregation being by this time di&s;per&s;ed and in di&s;order, little notice was taken by the &s;exton of a circum|&s;tance which might naturally happen at a funeral in two of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ame family. After Henry and Caroline, both deprived of utterance, had been in this &s;ituation the &s;pace of a minute, Charles, who had followed Olivia un&s;een, only for the melancholy &s;a|tisfaction of a la&s;t look, came up, and find|ing Caroline in the attitude above de&s;cribed, kneeled down by the &s;ide of his &s;i&s;ter and friend, and, in a &s;uppre&s;&s;ed voice, exclaimed, "O Heaven! Is it po&s;&s;ible? whom do I &s;ee? Caroline and Henry!"</P>
<P>Charles took Caroline by the hand, and they walked out of the church by the chan|cel door, e&s;caping thus the general ob|&s;ervation. Henry followed, and did not &s;peak till they had reached the grand ave|nue of afflicting memory, and which led equally to the abbey and ca&s;tle. "I know not," &s;aid Caroline "how to account for this, otherwi&s;e than an event brought about without the con&s;ent, or, I might almo&s;t
<PB N="231" REF="240">&s;ay, the knowledge of either me or my bro|ther. The wi&s;dom of Providence worked by ways in&s;crutable. The &s;tory of our wan|derings at this awful hour is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, but deeming it of heavenly direc|tion, I &s;hall u&s;e it to acknowlege that your letter found its way into our &s;ouls, and that it is our joint de&s;ire and &s;upplication that you ob&s;erve your oath, and obey your fa|ther and your God."</P>
<P>Caroline trembled as &s;he &s;poke; the ef|fort to be firm, and to recover her&s;elf, did but the more plainly &s;hew the exce&s;&s;es of her agitation.</P>
<P>Henry looked at Charles, who tenderly taking his hand, entered into a brief explana|tion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed in their di&s;cour&s;e at the porch of the chapel, which preceded their meeting at the funeral. He ended with the determination of his &s;i&s;ter, if the monk ap|proved. "And for my part," added Charles, "I have come to re&s;olves which will render it no le&s;s impo&s;&s;ible for me to ob&s;truct your union with Olivia, whom it is my &s;olemn intreaty"&mdash;here Charles pau&s;ed&mdash;"my &s;o|lemn
<PB N="232" REF="241">intreaty&mdash;alas! my earne&s;t &s;upplication&mdash;that you &s;hould&mdash;O! Henry, Henry&mdash;you know the re&s;t." Caroline, in a &s;tate of equal trouble, undertook to apologize for her bro|ther's want of words to expre&s;s the act on which he was not the le&s;s re&s;olved&mdash;and en|deavouring to make up the deficiency, &s;he fell into language &s;o incoherent, ob&s;tructed, and inaudible, that relieving her&s;elf by a violent bur&s;t of tears, &s;he declared it was a &s;ubject which defied the power of words and depended on deeds only&mdash;what tho&s;e deeds were to be, had been in part explained, and this, alas! was no time to enlarge.</P>
<P>"Brother," &s;aid Caroline, "we mu&s;t cro&s;s yonder part of the fore&s;t to the chapel."</P>
<P>"And not one token of eternal remem|brance, at an eternal parting!" cried Henry, whom extremity of &s;en&s;ation had hitherto kept &s;ilent. "Remembrance," replied Ca|roline, "O! it &s;hall, it mu&s;t be indeed eternal, and for an eternity of ble&s;&s;ings upon thee, if we now leave each other to our re|&s;pective duties, the performance of which may, and, alas! mu&s;t, give us mi&s;ery, but of
<PB N="233" REF="242">which the omi&s;&s;ion would be &s;hame, horror, and de&s;pair! I &s;peak," added &s;he, "with &s;olemn reference to the living and the dead! Deare&s;t and be&s;t of men! farewell&mdash;fare|well&mdash;for ever!"</P>
<P>Henry, plunged in unutterable angui&s;h, pre&s;&s;ed her extended hand to his lips&mdash;and copious were the burning tears that bathed it.</P>
<P>Caroline turned away her head.</P>
<P>Charles &s;poke not, but clung round Henry's neck. Nature could carry the &s;en|&s;ation no farther. They &s;eparated in dreadful &s;ilence; Henry taking the road to the ca&s;tle, and the brother and &s;i&s;ter returned to the chapel-hou&s;e.</P>

<P>THEY had &s;carce reached the fore&s;t path, when they &s;aw a light advancing to|wards them, and heard the &s;ound of voices which they knew to proceed from Denni&s;on and father Arthur. "My dear children,"
<PB N="234" REF="243">exclaimed the latter, running towards them, "you have alarmed us by your untimely ab&s;ence; whither have you been wandering?" "Explanations mu&s;t be deferred," &s;aid Charles; "let us make the be&s;t of our way to the chapel-hou&s;e, for our minds and bodies equally demand repo&s;e."&mdash;"Lend Charles your arm, my good Denni&s;on, and mine &s;hall be the &s;upport of this dear young lady," cried Arthur, "and I command you both not to add to your fatigues by another word till we regain our peace-re&s;toring abode; and then you &s;hall &s;ilently partake of the refre&s;h|ment we have prepared for you, and the word <HI>farewell</HI> &s;hall be all that pa&s;&s;es between us till the morning."</P>
<P>This truly excellent monk was, on the next day, made acquainted with all that had happened&mdash;from the conver&s;ation at the chapel-hou&s;e to the rencontre at the church.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee, I &s;ee the Almighty hand in it all," &s;aid Arthur. "By what un&s;earchable means is the will of Heaven fulfilled! Your re&s;olves are the re&s;ult of virtue, &s;trongly proved, and for every tear you &s;hed in her cau&s;e, a &s;mile from
<PB N="235" REF="244">that heaven &s;hall await you. Your temporal &s;ufferings have been indeed extreme, but eternity is before you, and I fore&s;ee, with a prophet's eye, that even in this world you &s;hall have an earne&s;t of your reward in that which is to come. Nay, you have it at this hour, my children. Look into your own pure hearts, and tell me, if you would ex|change the con&s;cious reflections which are there lodged, for all that is heaping up in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who now inhabit the abbey? Is your lo&s;s infinite? So &s;hall be your gain. He who trieth the very heart and reins hath tried you; but O! my dear, dear children, he hath examined and proved you, and made your way acceptable to him. What a con|&s;olation! what a victory! to be acquitted with honour by&mdash;nay to claim the approba|tion of your con&s;cience and your God! Tell me, doth it not deprive adver&s;ity of her &s;ting, enlarge every generous affection of the &s;oul, and cru&s;h every &s;elfi&s;h thought? It doth, it doth, my children, and it will give to returning pro&s;perity, come when it may, more delightful charms! and be&s;ides
<PB N="236" REF="245">extracting thorns from the pre&s;ent, &s;hall con|fer more &s;weets than he perfume of the flowers of Paradi&s;e on the future. Yes, my children, when you re&s;t this night on your pillow, if your eyes &s;hould overflow at the retro&s;pect of your &s;ufferings and di&s;appoint|ments, reflect but for one moment that you have gained the applau&s;e of him whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, and you will &s;lumber in peace and wake in triumph."</P>
<P>There was no profe&s;&s;ional pedantry, no unmeaning prie&s;tcraft in the character of fa|ther Arthur. He &s;eldom held down his friends to long di&s;&s;ertations; but when he did a&s;&s;ert the dignity of his office, his eloquence touched at once the under&s;tanding, the fancy, and the heart: while he &s;poke, the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to die away, and the hearer thought it folly and delu&s;ion to di&s;quiet him&s;elf about any pur&s;uits le&s;s exalted than tho&s;e which fill up the highe&s;t capacities of our nature. From his venerable lips the auditor became intimate with the lofty character of his being, and the &s;ublime ends of his mind; the pa&s;&s;ions were purified, the de&s;ires elevated, and every fa|culty
<PB N="237" REF="246">of the &s;oul a&s;&s;umed new energy and ex|tent, as he painted the joys of con&s;cience, and the bright recompence of the crown that "pa&s;&s;eth not away."</P>
<P>He deemed this the fit opportunity to in|vigorate and encourage &s;uffering virtue. He entered, feelingly, into the variety of &s;orrows which be&s;et two amiable per&s;ons. His bene|volent heart melted at the &s;cenes of woe they had undergone, and at all they might yet have to endure. Their di&s;appointments in whatever was mo&s;t dear to the human heart, called forth all his compa&s;&s;ion, all his powers, and giving vent to his bounteous feelings, he addre&s;&s;ed to them the &s;entiments we have here recorded.</P>
<P>Every word had its due force, and they al|ternately embraced the good man when he had done, as if they were indeed his children.</P>
<P>Such rea&s;onings are not lo&s;t on worthy minds; they had their effect on Charles and Caroline, who appeared on the following day endued with new vigour to conduct them with patience and honour through the &s;trong duties they had to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247">The admonition of father Arthur, re&s;|pecting the affair of the convent, was con&s;i&s;t|ent with the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s that per|vaded his councils; and after a private con|ference with Caroline, whom he prevailed upon to put the entire management of the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as &s;eeking out a fit place for her reception, and fit a&s;&s;ociations, where and with whom to begin her pious offices, he convened his little auditory, con&s;i&s;ting of Ca|roline and Charles, Denni&s;on and his Indian boy, and &s;miling upon them all, begged their attention to a few ob&s;ervations which pre&s;&s;ed on his mind, in a &s;urvey he had taken of the late occurrences.</P>
<P>"My dear children and friends," &s;aid he, "it is worthy your notice, that in the petty &s;pace of a few weeks have fallen out a variety of events, which mu&s;t &s;ink deep into the re|flecting mind. In the degradation of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, and in the circum&s;tances that preceded and followed it, we have &s;een the pageantry of power, and the pride of fortune, unable to &s;hield the hypocrite&mdash;pardon me
<PB N="239" REF="248">for the u&s;e of &s;trong words to paint &s;trong truths&mdash;the hypocrite, I &s;ay, from detection, mi&s;ery, and &s;hame; we have &s;een him de|&s;erted by his own &s;ervants. They fled from the contagion of vice to the protection of virtue; they left with an hone&s;t di&s;dain the lordly man&s;ion, and &s;ought the cottage of piety and re&s;ignation. My dear children, doth not this point out the &s;ublime authority and protection of virtue, even when &s;he is depre&s;&s;ed by misfortunes, and bowed down with or rather elevated by &s;orrows? At the lea&s;t fear of Sir Armine's danger, did not the atte&s;ting country manife&s;t in its woe the in|e&s;timable value of a good man's life? did not the heart-&s;woln grief of friends, neigh|bours, children, illu&s;trate the importance and the maje&s;ty of virtue? and when it plea&s;ed him who liveth from eternity to eternity, to call the good man to the inheritance of the ju&s;t, did it not &s;eem, by the attend|ance, the tears, the groans, of the count|le&s;s multitude, as if each &s;pectator was fol|lowing a father to the grave; did not you your&s;elves feel as if you were <HI>his</HI> children?"</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="249">"O that it had plea&s;ed Heaven to have made us &s;uch!" exclaimed Charles. The tears of Caroline began to flow; the hoary cheek of Denni&s;on was not dry, and the In|dian child of nature crowded clo&s;e to Arthur, touched his robe with pious awe, and doubted whether man or angel had &s;poken. "But," re&s;umed Arthur, "when it was but rumoured that Sir Gui&s;e was on the bed of death, did it not rather &s;eem to be the approach of &s;ome happy and unexpected revolution in favour of mankind, at but the di&s;tant pro&s;pect of being emancipated from &s;ome de&s;potic tyrant, who&s;e life was obnoxious, and who&s;e di&s;&s;olu|tion was implored? and had <HI>his</HI> death fol|lowed, is there a &s;igh which would have been heaved, &s;ave tho&s;e of mercy and terror for his departing &s;oul, or a tear &s;hed by one of all the congratulating thou&s;ands on his hear&s;e?" "O yes, a thou&s;and &s;ighs&mdash;a thou&s;and tears," exclaimed Caroline, &s;ighing and weeping in proof.&mdash;"My deare&s;t child," rejoined Ar|thur, taking her hand, "pardon my having forcibly touched a wounding &s;ubject; the All-good is of long patience, and of eternal
<PB N="241" REF="250">kindne&s;s! thy father may be yet pre&s;erved as an example of penitence, as con&s;tant as his crimes have hitherto been la&s;ting."</P>
<P>Caroline dropt on her knee, elevating her hands, and &s;eemed to offer up a prayer which the&s;e chearing words had excited in her &s;oul. Denni&s;on and Charles lifted their eyes to heaven, and the Indian boy rai&s;ed up Caro|line, &s;aying, "Young lady was &s;o pretty and &s;o good, that good God would make her father good yet for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake."</P>
<P>"We have &s;een too in your&s;elves, my children," concluded Arthur, "the up|right finding favour and honour, followed by the prayers of the living, nay the per&s;ecu|tors them&s;elves, in de&s;pite of the inveteracy of habit, or natural hardne&s;s of heart, feel the awful powers of per&s;i&s;ting innocence; and, perhaps, the deepe&s;t re&s;entment of the bad again&s;t the good ari&s;es from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that even the happie&s;t triumphs of vice are le&s;s to be envied than the mi&s;eries of &s;uffering virtue, which we are told, and ble&s;&s;ed be the great Rewarder, we <HI>know,</HI> "Is but more re|li&s;hed as the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed." Witne&s;s for
<PB N="242" REF="251">me, O recompen&s;ing Power, how &s;incerely I weep at the griefs and di&s;a&s;ters of this afflicted brother and &s;i&s;ter! How my heart glows at the fidelity of this good old man, how it beats with a paternal tenderne&s;s towards this poor artle&s;s youth, who&s;e untutored mind is filled with natural goodne&s;s! Witne&s;s all this! and witne&s;s at the &s;ame time, that I ex|perience more &s;oul-felt &s;atisfaction in &s;uffering with them, in affording them my humble pro|tection and encouragement, in &s;hewing to this enlightened pair the benevolence of Heaven <HI>made manife&s;t even in their adver&s;ity,</HI> in pointing to the &s;ure rewards that await this venerable man, and in opening upon the dawning rea&s;on of this boy tho&s;e &s;ublime truths which may convince him not only that his God is "to be &s;een in clouds and heard in winds," but that his creative, protective, and &s;u&s;taining power, embraces all climes and encircles all nature; and la&s;tly, that whatever may be the di&s;tinctions of partial man, the Maker of us all acts under influence of no &s;uch prejudices&mdash;but attending only to the complection of the heart, hath allotted a place
<PB N="243" REF="252">of happine&s;s and glory to all that wear the forms of men, whether born under the blaze of the &s;un or placed beyond the reach of his beams!"</P>
<P>While father Arthur made this apo&s;trophe, his eyes &s;parkled, his cheeks glowed, and the &s;incerity of his heart was vi&s;ible in his features.</P>
<P>"Ma&s;&s;er," &s;aid Flore&s;co, "me could hear you talk all times, and me am better boy, and better good chri&s;tian black every time, and me &s;hall go to good place like white man, and live all times with good peoples and good Ma&s;&s;er, and be in God's heaven, though Ne|gro boy!"</P>

<PB N="246" REF="255">boldne&s;s, it is not fit he &s;hould; I hope the good '&s;quire will think what will betide every thing at the old abbey, if the new fangled &s;trange woman&mdash;I can't for the heart of me call her my lady&mdash;is left to have every thing her own way; and if the lawful heir is away, and your honour &s;hut up, who is to prevent the&s;e doings? If an humble &s;ervant, therefore, may be &s;o bold to advi&s;e, it is this, that your honour will be &s;o kind as to make u&s;e of the above 1100l. &s;eeing it belongs to the family, by your lady&s;hip's &s;ide, and as the chapel-hou&s;e is, as I may &s;ay, in a &s;traight between two, the abbey and the ca&s;tle, both being too near neighbours, &s;eeing they are not friends, and mu&s;t be, as circum&s;tances now are, eye|&s;ores to your honour and the '&s;quire, my bro|ther Ned's farm has a topping good hou&s;e up|on it&mdash;and as I know &s;omething of the bu|&s;ine&s;s, I could carry on the farming, and your honours might live upon the &s;ame, and with his reverence and his good little black, we might be happy, in an humble way, con&s;ider|ing what your honours have been u&s;ed to, till God &s;ees good time to re&s;tore you to
<PB N="247" REF="256">your own; and as his reverence &s;ays we carry our own heaven or hell about us; &s;o our heaven upon earth may as well be at Ned's farm, as any where el&s;e, till we all get into your heavens above. Such is your humble &s;ervant's good coun&s;el; but if it &s;o be it be not taken, and your honours prefer a London town life, or the like of this public way, Ned's farm might be turned into hard money, for as to carrying it on again&s;t your honour's good will, or your honours to live in one place, and Denni&s;on in another, it is not to be reckoned upon, &s;eeing it cannot be; for as it is &s;aid in the holy bible, u&s;ed in churches, "where&s;oever you lodge will I lodge," and &s;o on. The lea&s;e, and the &s;tock, and the hou&s;e|holds, would make up a roundi&s;h-like &s;um, and your honour's 1100l. might go thereto, and together we might live bobbi&s;hly. Now do not, my good lady mi&s;s, think my humble de&s;igns, hereby, to hurt you, the &s;quire, or his reverence, by making a mighty matter of the afore&s;aid, in the way of vain-glory, which is a &s;in forbidden, and if it were not, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of, for if a man's heart goes to
<PB N="248" REF="257">the thing that &s;hould not be, what are laws and go&s;pels, in churches and chapels, your honour?

</LETTER>
<P>To write this epi&s;tle was Denni&s;on's em|ployment, after he had withdrawn for the night, and it took him up &s;ome hours; after which he laid him&s;elf on the bed, without undre&s;&s;ing, and enjoyed the mo&s;t &s;weet re|po&s;e till the u&s;ual hour of ri&s;ing, when going into the chamber of the little Indian, who he found had been at his pen and ink al&s;o, borrowing from &s;leep what he gave to his &s;tudies; Denni&s;on put the letter into his hand, de&s;iring it might be laid on the break|fa&s;t table, neare&s;t the lady Caroline's &s;eat, and covered over with the&s;e &s;weet flowers, which I have fre&s;h gathered&mdash;"But &s;tay," &s;ays Denni&s;on, "my good boy, we mu&s;t bru&s;h off this morning dew, or it will wet the paper, and I would not for all the flowers i' the field, have that happen." Here he &s;hook them gently, and dried them one by one, then gave them to Flore&s;co, who artle&s;sly
<PB N="250" REF="259">&s;aid: "Me gue&s;s who that letter comes from&mdash;'tis from &s;omebody that loves mi&s;|&s;ey." "You are right, boy," replied Denni|&s;on, "it is from one that loves her dearly." "Aye, I tought &s;o; but why you put pinks, ro&s;es, and &s;uch'um like over dat? Mi&s;&s;ey will tink dere is no &s;weet but de &s;weet words of him him loves. Ah! me knows dat, though Negro boy. Looke you, dis ickle letter come from mine own Zoraida in mine own coun|try; it is dear as mine own heart, and it make me cry, and it make me laugh; but &s;ee 'tis almo&s;t gone into bits and &s;craps, with &s;hut|ting and opening; for I have a peep at it every times I am by my&s;elf&mdash;but ma&s;&s;er is almo&s;t makey me write de nice words, and I learn de fa&s;ter that I may &s;end to my own heart's dear Zoraida for another letter, as dis is almo&s;t wear out; &s;ee, I have been writin A, B, C, D, and E, and tink me &s;hall pick my own Zoraida's name out by and bye; but I mu&s;t make him hold together till dat you know. I wi&s;h him was as fre&s;h as dis to mi&s;&s;ey."</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="260">Previous to this ob&s;ervation, the poor boy took out of his pocket-book a little lea|thern ca&s;e, from which he produced a parcel wrapt in &s;everal papers, and la&s;tly a piece of &s;hawl made its appearance, in which was guarded Zoraida's epi&s;tle, that was &s;ent to him after he had been &s;old, but now terribly torn in the foldings, and, indeed, almo&s;t in tatters. After &s;hewing it Denni&s;on with a di&s;con&s;olate look, he ki&s;&s;ed it &s;omewhat too devoutly; for two of the pieces, incapable of bearing the ardour of the &s;alutation, fell to the ground. His di&s;tre&s;s is not ea&s;ily de|&s;cribed, at the di&s;covery of this di&s;a&s;ter: it was expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ort of &s;hriek, at the end of which he exclaimed, &s;tooping down, "Oh! mine heart&mdash;mine poor heart&mdash;is drop in bits, and I no write yet to get him fre&s;h."</P>
<P>He then gathered up the pieces, in which Denni&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted, promi&s;ing to write a letter to Zoraida for him, and in the mean time to contrive &s;ome means of patching up the old one.</P>
<P>This compromi&s;ed the matter; and the grateful boy, putting up the precious reliques,
<PB N="252" REF="261">with the &s;ame care he had taken them out, went to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;teward's packet, according to the orders he had received.</P>
<P>The company &s;oon appeared at their morning repa&s;t; and the letter was di&s;covered under the flowers, by the lovely eyes for who&s;e peru&s;al it was intended. They dropt many a lucid te&s;timony, to denote that the contents were intere&s;ting to the affections, while they pau&s;ed on the &s;entiments; and "Good, dear, excellent old man!" exclaimed &s;he, at the conclu&s;ion, "were our misfor|tunes to an&s;wer no greater end than calling forth &s;uch virtues as thine, we &s;hould not &s;uffer in vain!" The letter was then given to Charles, who, with equal emotions, read it aloud. "Not that any part of the hone&s;t creature's offer can po&s;&s;ibly be accepted," &s;aid Charles; "but it is honorary to the human &s;oul to be in friend&s;hip with &s;uch a man!" "True," &s;aid Arthur; "but to con&s;ider our&s;elves worthy to be followed by &s;uch a man, from the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting into that of mourning, is a triumph which is re&s;erved only for the good."</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="262">Flore&s;co, who had li&s;tened to every &s;yl|lable with the utmo&s;t attention, &s;truggled with his &s;en&s;ations &s;ome time, and at la&s;t bur&s;t into tears; amid&s;t the flow of which he exclaimed, "O! make me, ma&s;&s;er, like Mr. Denni&s;on; but me am poor Negro boy, and no money; but me give ickle to poor beg|garman, and would diggey and workey all day, all night, all life, for feel as him feels."</P>
<P>But Denni&s;on him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed not the&s;e tender effects of his letter. On the contrary, he purpo&s;ely ab&s;ented him&s;elf, and was mi&s;|&s;ing the whole morning. Oh, Reader, what is in the human heart, when it has either done any thing remarkably meritorious or ba&s;e, to avoid the eyes, while the action is recent, of the benefitted or wronged? Is it the hone&s;t internal &s;hame which con&s;cience dictates, on one hand, and the ingenuous mode&s;ty, and delicate fear of wounding the feelings of the object whom we have &s;erved, on the other? Both produce blu&s;hes, but as different in their effect, as in their cau&s;e. When Denni&s;on at la&s;t made his reluctant appearance, he could not have ca&s;t down his eyes, nor di&s;covered a
<PB N="254" REF="263">more glowing cheek, or tumultuous voice, had he been detected in robbing the parties of the &s;um he had offered to lend them. But his generous di&s;tre&s;s was &s;oon lo&s;t in the embraces of his friends.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My &s;till and for ever beloved Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is now that I am to confirm, in the name of my&s;elf and &s;i&s;ter, her re&s;olves, and my own, to put it out of the power of either of us to do you or your much-injured family any further wrong. Humiliated to the very du&s;t, and overwhelmed with confu&s;ion, I turn back my view on the evils which have been brought upon your hou&s;e by the animo&s;ity of mine: nor do I think I could bear the angui&s;h
<PB N="255" REF="264">of the&s;e reflexions, were I not in&s;tantly, on my part, to make all the atonement in <HI>my</HI> power; at the &s;ame time my almo&s;t angel &s;i&s;ter equals the &s;acrifice on <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>Know then, my friend, that we, like you, have now our &s;olemn vows regi&s;tered in heaven. We concur in giving up our eternal hopes to the vows made to your dying father, and to the happine&s;s of Olivia Clare. We have long &s;truggled with impo&s;&s;ibilities. Such were the preten&s;ions of us all. We yield. And if we did not, &s;uch has been the horror of pa&s;t occurrences, that were even our former affections to take their bent, the greate&s;t im|po&s;&s;ibility would be, to reconcile, even with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our darling objects, tho&s;e deep wounds in the memory, which mu&s;t for ever open wide, and &s;tream with the blood of Sir Armine, &s;hed by Sir Gui&s;e! Neither Olivia nor Henry, with all their magic, could de|moli&s;h this everla&s;ting barrier to our repo&s;e. The father ri&s;ing again&s;t the father, and the broken oath of a friend, and the breaking heart of an adorable woman&mdash;perhaps her hate &s;uperadded&mdash;Oh! in&s;upportable addi|tion!
<PB N="256" REF="265">&mdash;and all this as a judgment on our violations&mdash;would mix in every thought, and empoi&s;on felicity, even in the arms of love. Think, O think, my friend, what mu&s;t be the &s;tate of my feelings, or of Caroline's; pier|cingly tender, alas! as they ever were, when con&s;cience tells us, we ought to felicitate our&s;elves on a mutual e&s;cape from the only injuries which Sir Gui&s;e has left in the power of his children to do the children of Sir Armine: yet felicitate our&s;elves we cannot; for our lo&s;s is infinite and eternal; but that we may become the victims of a &s;tern and ab&s;o|lute law of honour and of con&s;cience, we have, in the mo&s;t awful manner, and in a &s;ituation the mo&s;t &s;olemn, even kneeling at the tomb of our &s;ainted mother, mutually &s;worn. You will not even receive this letter, till no earthly power could change our re&s;olves. My &s;i&s;ter joins me in wi&s;hing you all the good that can be thought, and far more than can be ex|pre&s;&s;ed. She unites too in the firm per&s;ua|&s;ion and belief, that the graces and virtues of&mdash;O &s;tubborn heart! why do&s;t thou throb with a violence that makes the un&s;teady hand

Notwith&s;tanding which, I dare not confe&s;s, even to my gentle &s;i&s;ter, the&s;e marks of di&s;tracting, hopele&s;s, yet tyrannizing affection, which I have blended with the &s;imple expre&s;&s;ion of our re&s;olves and good wi&s;hes, that I undertook to communicate.

<P>The above packet was di&s;patched by the tru&s;ty Denni&s;on, who was made acquainted with &s;o much of its contents as to convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity of its being delivered to Henry Fitzorton's own hand, and in private, without waiting any replies.</P>
<P>Olivia was walking with Henry in a back avenue of the ca&s;tle as Denni&s;on rode up to the hou&s;e, and by a concealment of the trees, which were there thicker than ordinary, to &s;erve as a &s;creen from the north-ea&s;t wind, he did not perceive either Henry or the young lady till they were too clo&s;e for any retreat. And this would have been rendered
<PB N="261" REF="270">yet more difficult, as little Fitz&mdash;who, as u&s;ual, was the attendant on Henry and Olivia&mdash;happening to wander, on the hunt, into the path that Denni&s;on had taken&mdash;announced, by cries of gladne&s;s, that one of the abbey family was at hand. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iver&s;al tremor &s;eized Henry. Denni&s;on had always been the faithful medium of his affections, and &s;ilently &s;hared in his regrets and di&s;appoint|ments. Denni&s;on was him&s;elf greatly moved at this &s;udden encounter, and the mutual en|deavour of both to conceal it from Olivia, more effectually betrayed them. Far, how|ever, far as tender &s;ympathy is from jealous &s;u&s;picion, was that &s;pirit of candour from conjecturing that the real cau&s;e was &s;eated in the de&s;pairing Henry's heart, or that the good old man was in its fulle&s;t confidence. Attri|buting the whole to &s;ome untold calamity which had happened in a family, in who&s;e mi&s;|fortunes they were all, in a manner, involved, and the &s;ufferings of her ever-remembered Caroline fir&s;t exciting her &s;ympathy, "Alas!" exclaimed &s;he, "I fear &s;ome fre&s;h di&s;tre&s;s has fallen out at the abbey. Tell me, &s;ir, is Mi&s;s
<PB N="262" REF="271">Stuart, or the good Charles, in any new di|&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;What le&s;s can be the cau&s;e of the&s;e emotions?"&mdash;Denni&s;on an&s;wered only by a heavy &s;igh and &s;hake of the head. On re|covering him&s;elf, he &s;aid he was charged with a commi&s;&s;ion from his young ma&s;ter to '&s;quire Henry, which mu&s;t be deferred till he re|gained his &s;trength and &s;pirits. "I am a poor, infirm creature, Mi&s;s, and a little mat|ter over&s;ets me."</P>
<P>Olivia, who was, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, one of the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting of human beings, de&s;ired Henry to a&s;&s;i&s;t the old &s;teward into the hou&s;e, where they had no &s;ooner arrived, than, receiving a &s;ummons from her father, &s;he left Henry and Denni&s;on together.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Denni&s;on, "I fear me much, the weakne&s;s I have been guilty of has well nigh di&s;covered what my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s enjoined me to conceal. But your honour and madam took me unwares&mdash;I was not in the be&s;t &s;pirits before.&mdash;I have lo&s;t my re&s;t of &s;ome nights.&mdash;Sleep is an old man's friend.&mdash;I did not think to &s;ee your honour &s;o much changed&mdash;and I forgot you were all in black;
<PB N="263" REF="272">and poor little Fitz's love put me in mind of former times; and I had ju&s;t left one &s;et of &s;orrowfuls to meet another&mdash;&s;o that it was too much for an old creature, and I doubt the young lady's &s;u&s;picion&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ah! &s;he hath not an atom in her di&s;po|&s;ition!" cried Henry; "but for pity's &s;ake, thou to whom I owe eternal gratitude&mdash;gra|titude which even de&s;pair cannot extingui&s;h, tell me the me&s;&s;age you have brought from the abbey?"</P>
<P>"Not from the abbey, but the chapel-hou&s;e," &s;ighed forth Denni&s;on. He then took out Charles's packet, which, having put into one of Henry's hands, he pre&s;&s;ed the other to his aged bo&s;om, ki&s;&s;ed it, then wi&s;hed him all God's choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, &s;aying, "If that lovely young lady was to be his bride, &s;he mu&s;t be a happy one, even though he thereby lo&s;t Mi&s;s Caroline. I cannot, mu&s;t not &s;tay, my dear, honoured '&s;quire; but upon earth and in heaven I &s;hall remember, love, and ble&s;s you!"</P>
<P>The tears of an old white-headed man, who&s;e hone&s;ty we have long known, and
<PB N="264" REF="273">who&s;e affection we have often proved, &s;hed over us at probably an eternal parting, are, at <HI>all</HI> times, affecting; but in Henry's ca&s;e&mdash;combined, as it was, with the mo&s;t touching circum&s;tances of gratitude, doubt, terror, and tenderne&s;s&mdash;it is no wonder that he &s;uffered Denni&s;on to leave the ca&s;tle without the ut|terance of another word.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a con&s;iderable time before he had &s;ufficient &s;trength to open the eventful packet, of which his inmo&s;t &s;oul felt at once the virtue, the energy, and the irremediable nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;"Excellent Charles! divine Ca|roline!" &s;aid he. "Yes, your Henry &s;hall be added to &s;well the &s;acrifice of &s;elf-devoted victims; and our oaths &s;hall be re&s;pect|ed!"</P>
<P>By degrees his mind &s;oftened to a &s;ort of pious acquie&s;cence, and &s;eeing him&s;elf hem|med round by innumerable duties at the ca&s;|tle, and in&s;urmountable difficulties at the ab|bey, a new oath a&s;cended &s;ilently from his lips to that Heaven which had received his former, and, kneeling down, he cried out in a loud voice, thrice repeating it, "Here
<PB N="265" REF="274">then, again I &s;wear to devote my hand to Olivia! Witne&s;s the oath, O God!"</P>
<P>Olivia, re-entering, di&s;tinctly overheard Henry pronounce this &s;olemn a&s;&s;everation. He was yet on his knees. Olivia rai&s;ed him into her innocent arms.&mdash;"Join, join my fer|vent and humble prayer," &s;aid &s;he, "to the atte&s;ting God, that I may de&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ing tho&s;e vows impart!" Henry reiterated them in her embrace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE they were thus &s;ituated, John Fitzorton came into the apartment to witne&s;s this. Olivia, to ea&s;e the overflowing of her heart, which had now felt the fir&s;t returns of joy &s;ince the death of Sir Armine, could not
<PB N="266" REF="275">forbear de&s;cribing to John the circum&s;tance which had given birth to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Henry delivered to his brother the letter which had been addre&s;&s;ed to his care; and John, after ha&s;tily reading it, went out of the room.</P>
<P>Henry and Olivia, being again left toge|ther, fell into a train of reflections, which, in|&s;en&s;ibly, brought round the conver&s;ation to the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs at the abbey.</P>
<P>"Alas!" cried Olivia, "I dread, yet wi&s;h to hear what are tho&s;e &s;ad events which have the power to affect not only the &s;ympathi&s;ing heart of my beloved Henry, but to move the firm temper of John. It was, I &s;ee, not with|out difficulty he re&s;trained his tears. But did you notice the affecting turn of his powerful eyes as he directed them to us? The more I &s;ee of him, the &s;tronger is my veneration. How gratifying to the inmo&s;t &s;oul to po&s;&s;e&s;s his approbation; but, good Heaven! how in|&s;upportable would be his anger!"</P>
<P>Although this was an hour in which Olivia gained extremely on Henry, he had pre&s;ence of mind enough to communicate only &s;uch
<PB N="267" REF="276">parts of the chapel-hou&s;e packet as might &s;atisfy the &s;olicitude which he &s;aw it had rai&s;ed: to have told her all he knew, would only have de&s;troyed her happine&s;s, and augmented his own infelicity; and he had now firmly re&s;olved to re&s;ign him&s;elf to the inevitable de&s;tiny of his life. He informed her, therefore, of the Baronet's indi&s;creet mar|riage; of the open rupture which had hap|pened in con&s;equence of making &s;uch a wife the mi&s;tre&s;s of his family; of the impo&s;&s;ibility there was, that Caroline, or her brother, &s;hould remain longer at the abbey; of their departure thence; of their pre&s;ent re&s;idence with the venerable father Arthur, and their dome&s;tic, the good Denni&s;on; of their forlorn &s;tate of mind and fortunes; and of their future de|&s;tination, bound by oaths, which, "from my acquaintance with both," &s;aid Henry, with a trembling voice, "I know to be irrevocable as fate it&s;elf."</P>
<P>Olivia not only gave him full credit for the tender feelings of friend&s;hip, but countenanced them by generous te&s;timonies of her own, and a&s;ked, with the mo&s;t fa&s;cinating &s;impli|city
<PB N="268" REF="277">and ardour, "whether it were not po&s;&s;i|ble e&s;&s;entially to &s;erve the&s;e excellent per&s;ons without wounding their delicacy? My be|loved Henry will not &s;uppo&s;e that I involve their virtues in the faults of their father; or that I do not as fervently wi&s;h, and intend to &s;ue for, the revived friend&s;hip and &s;ociety of Caroline. And if I have been withheld from the like avowals, it has been in con|formity to the melancholy, which mu&s;t, alas! long hang over our hou&s;e, and which &s;u&s;pends every promi&s;e of the heart. But, indeed, Henry, I have a faithful memory, and think it is a &s;olemn duty, incumbent on us both, to con&s;ult each other, till we &s;trike upon &s;ome expedient by which your friend Charles and my Caroline &s;hould be reconciled to the felicity we &s;hould feel in rendering them happy."</P>
<P>"Generous creature!" cried Henry, "it is impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>John re-entered, and read the letter he had received from Charles; "becau&s;e," he &s;aid, "it was to the honour of the human race that &s;uch an action &s;hould be known."</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="278">"Where," &s;aid Olivia, "where mu&s;t be the heart of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, that it catches not &s;ome &s;parks of virtue from &s;uch a &s;on!"</P>
<P>"And how irrefragable mu&s;t be that &s;on's virtue," added John, "which receives no foul tints from the contagious example of &s;uch a father!"</P>
<P>Henry &s;ighed in the heavine&s;s of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>"Something might, &s;urely, be contrived notwith&s;tanding," whi&s;pered Olivia.</P>
<P>Henry, fully &s;en&s;ible of her excellence, begged the &s;ubject might drop for the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Olivia, however, took an early oppor|tunity of renewing it, little imagining that &s;he was labouring the very point which kept alive the only &s;ubject it was her intere&s;t to annihilate, in&s;tead of &s;uffering it to die &s;ilently away. Henry, after &s;trong repetitions of his a&s;&s;urances, that nothing <HI>could</HI> be devi&s;ed, again put an end to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It occurred to Olivia, that Henry might be deterred from &s;erving his friend, on con|&s;ideration, that, as the power of conferring pecuniary obligations to any very con&s;ider|able
<PB N="270" REF="279">amount, would originate from her, &s;he thought that &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly give him a more graceful in&s;tance of her affection, and at the &s;ame time effectually indulge her own bounteous di&s;po&s;ition, than by entering pri|vately, and without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, into &s;uch arrangements as might an&s;wer the ends pro|po&s;ed. She could not ea&s;ily &s;ettle on a plan, but &s;he felt in every fibre of her heart, that &s;he would adopt any one that might be likely to promote an object, which, by tender prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for, and long meditation upon, was become, in addition to the a&s;&s;ured af|fection of Henry, the one thing nece&s;&s;ary to her happine&s;s. Day and night did &s;he revolve the point in her fancy; but ap|prehen&s;ive that either Charles or Ca|roline would put their &s;cheme into exe|cution before her own &s;hould be matured, or even engendered, &s;he formed the re&s;o|lution of paying a vi&s;it to Caroline; con|vinced, that when they got once together, &s;omething might be done which &s;hould fa|cilitate the happine&s;s of all.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="280">A pur&s;uit of this kind, in which all the generous affections are convened to a&s;&s;i&s;t, is among the highe&s;t delights of a young and animated mind; the agitation which attends, and the &s;ecrecy with which it is conducted, are parts of its happine&s;s. Olivia&mdash;who&s;e whole life was too innocent for the di&s;gui&s;es or concealments of an action or a thought&mdash;in|tended, that Henry, her father, and every|body concerned, &s;hould be, at a fit &s;ea&s;on, in confidence of her de&s;igns, but &s;he wi&s;hed to give them &s;omething like "form and pre&s;&s;ure," before they were revealed; and this &s;ecret interview with Caroline was de|&s;igned as the general outline. She knew, that two women, of warm imaginations, could do more towards the advancement of a favourite project, by one hour's conver|&s;ation, than by an age of &s;olitary thinking; and &s;he was <HI>pre-determined</HI> to believe, that her mind was &s;o exactly in &s;ympathy with that of Charles's &s;i&s;ter, that their wits would be in immediate uni&s;on, and that &s;omething would be &s;truck out&mdash;from this colli&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;which would
<PB N="272" REF="281">make her return to her &s;oul-beloved Henry, doubly happy, from the di&s;covered power of enlarging the &s;phere of his enjoyment; the grand point in which were concentered all the hopes and endeavours of her life.</P>
<P>While &s;he was yet in &s;earch of an o&s;ten&s;i|ble motive for her vi&s;it&mdash;at lea&s;t &s;uch a one as could be rea&s;onably a&s;&s;igned&mdash;and while &s;he began to feel &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed at the difficulty, Caroline's &s;paniel&mdash;which had been for &s;ome time a&s;leep at her feet&mdash;&s;tarted in &s;lumber as if dreaming of the cha&s;e, then barked as if, after long puzzling at the &s;cent, he had hit it off, and, after running it at full cry, awoke. Courting his new mi&s;tre&s;s's care&s;|&s;es, he leaped into her lap; and at the &s;elf-&s;ame in&s;tant leaped into Olivia's mind, which had, al&s;o, been on the hunt, an idea that he would be a fit in&s;trument of her operations on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. "The mo&s;t proper and natural apology in the world, dear, little creature," exclaimed &s;he, &s;moothing his vel|vet ears, and patting his downy &s;ides: "The keeping thee, agreeable as thou art, &s;o long from thy poor mi&s;tre&s;s, has lain on my con|&s;cience,
<PB N="273" REF="282">and now that &s;he is under affliction, thy &s;ociety, and various endearing ways, may, haply, beguile her of her grief, and &s;teal her &s;ometimes from her&s;elf. Thou wilt &s;oon di&s;cover, dear, &s;en&s;ible, &s;agacious little being, that &s;he wants every relief which an old friend can afford, and wilt, therefore, double thy fondne&s;s. Nor &s;hall &s;he have cau&s;e to think thou ha&s;t been unfaithful, by volun|tary de&s;ertion. Albeit, thy fir&s;t ramblings di&s;covered the little truant of an hour, they were intended only that thy neighbouring friends &s;hould &s;hare thy company, and thou woulde&s;t have returned to her who owned thee&mdash;I know thou woulde&s;t&mdash;had not thy &s;ympathy for our &s;orrows, and my &s;eductions, kept thee from thy own hou&s;e. All this &s;hall thy lovely owner be told, and if there be ought of blame, it &s;hall light on Olivia; or, to clear thy fame from ingratitude, as rare in thy race as common in ours, even my Henry &s;hall be made a partner in the tre&s;pa&s;s we have committed; and thy lady &s;hall under&s;tand the arts <HI>he,</HI> too, u&s;ed to make thee &s;en&s;ible his at|tentions were never paid in vain. And yet, tru&s;t
<PB N="274" REF="283">me, kind-hearted creature, nothing but a &s;en&s;e of thy duty and mine own hone&s;ty &s;hould induce me to part with thee&mdash;but it will not be for ever; &s;ince I tell my affections, thy be&s;t friends &s;hall be mine, and thou, who art now to be an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the plan, wilt be entitled to part of its felicity."</P>
<P>Ah, reader! what arguments the inventive heart can find when it wants their aid! All this was very true, and it would have been no le&s;s &s;o had it been thought of many days before: but a feeble &s;paniel was now a tower of &s;trength to a favourite plan of ope|rations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING now remained to perfect Olivia's enterprize, but a fit opportunity of &s;allying forth, and this &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf. John had de&s;ired of Henry a morning's private conference; Lady Fitzorton was em|ployed in her own apartment; Mr. Clare was going his u&s;ual ride. Thus favoured by circum&s;tances, &s;he gave out, that as the day invited, &s;he &s;hould live in the air, and wander
<PB N="275" REF="284">about like one of its feathered inhabitants. "But," &s;aid &s;he to her father as he was mounting his hor&s;e, "I &s;hall only make a cir|cular flight of it, and at the &s;ound of the dre&s;|&s;ing bell return to my ne&s;t." She &s;oon &s;um|moned her four-footed a&s;&s;ociate, who &s;eemed to take the hint, and with a bounding &s;tep and beating heart &s;he &s;et forward toward the chapel-hou&s;e. It was an enterprize that more than emulated the &s;pirit of older times; it put the flower of knighthood to the blu&s;h. It had the pure&s;t motive, and propo&s;ed the noble&s;t end. There were dangers to be pa&s;t, and difficulties to be &s;ubdued; but the&s;e all yielded to youthful hope and imagination, tho&s;e generous Quixotes in the chivalric ad|ventures of the human heart.</P>
<P>There is, a&s;&s;uredly, an exultation &s;eldom felt, and never to be de&s;cribed, attendant upon the performance of every hard and dif|ficult duty. Charles and Caroline Stuart were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this, after they had performed the &s;acrifices with an account of which Denni&s;on had been charged. And while that hone&s;t creature was on his com|mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="276" REF="285">the brother and &s;i&s;ter wept and &s;miled in the fullne&s;s of their hearts, &s;en&s;ible of their forlorn condition, yet proud to &s;uf|fer with the dignity of virtue, what virtue required. In this tearful triumph they re|lated what they had done to father Arthur, who&s;e reflection on their conduct produced the &s;ub&s;equent remark. "My children," &s;aid he, "the maje&s;ty, or the meanne&s;s, yet more than the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the &s;oul, is only to be a&s;certained by an occa&s;ion like this. The <HI>mean</HI> will temporize; the <HI>ma|je&s;tic</HI> will &s;toop to no accommodation &s;hort of the point which honour pre&s;cribes. The mean will &s;hift about for an eva&s;ion; me|thinks I &s;ee him trembling at the approach of a duty which menaces the deprivation of what he has long cheri&s;hed. His con&s;cience and his pa&s;&s;ions are at war within him. The in&s;urrection of the little invi&s;ible world is hot and ob&s;tinate, but his &s;pirit is abject. Virtue, with a frown, demands her &s;acrifice. He arms again&s;t her all his forces. She is immortal, and he arms in vain. 'Such a point mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be yielded,' &s;aith &s;he
<PB N="277" REF="286">&s;omewhat au&s;terely, he &s;till re&s;i&s;ts, and calls in his auxiliaries,&mdash;&s;ophi&s;try, prevarica|tion, and delay. They prevail not, for his own con&s;cience, another divinity, goes over to the &s;ide of virtue, even when every one of his pa&s;&s;ions keep the field. Behold, how he waits, to the la&s;t moment, in a mi&s;erable balance betwixt the di&s;grace of the mo&s;t vile and the glory of the mo&s;t virtuous action! Every hope and fear upon the &s;cout, to hunt for po&s;&s;ibilities of an e&s;cape, till pu&s;hed by circum&s;tances, he at la&s;t gives way only to an arbitrary nece&s;&s;ity; to that he yields without any impul&s;e from the moral prin|ciple, and repines for the re&s;t of his life. The maje&s;tic, on the other hand, not le&s;s &s;en|&s;ible of what is dear to keep, and difficult to part from, obeys, for a while, the dictate of human nature. He &s;ees the advancing power, that is to di&s;mantle his brea&s;t of a cheri&s;hed joy; he receives him with a &s;acred awe that wants a name, di&s;daining to hold in equipoi&s;e the choice of good and evil; or, when a great and po&s;itive duty, arrayed,
<PB N="278" REF="287">it may be, in terrors, and pronouncing what is fitting to be done&mdash;in the &s;till &s;mall voice of con&s;cience, who&s;e whi&s;pers are, to &s;uch minds, more loud and alarming than the thunder&mdash;the maje&s;tic, I &s;ay, my dear chil|dren, your recent experience tells you, takes the trea&s;ure which had been long enthroned on the heart of hearts, out of the bo&s;om, where it was lodged and treated as a gue&s;t from Heaven,&mdash;innocent affection is &s;uch&mdash;and, like the patriarch offering up his only &s;on at the command of God, prepares to &s;acri|fice; the maje&s;tic weeps and trembles at the altar as he binds the beloved victim&mdash;the blood of the heart &s;eems to blend with his tears, but they are the tears neither of weak|ne&s;s, nor of rebellion: They are not the bitter waters of repining on having made that &s;acrifice, but a &s;acred &s;tream flowing from a tender heart, which mingles the feel|ings of a man with the duties of a chri&s;tian. My children, he who made us 'trem|blingly alive,' &s;anctions the feeling which the agonizing yet bli&s;sful &s;en&s;ibility he gave,
<PB N="279" REF="288">creates. Even I, who have had my heart educated in the pale cloi&s;ter, there labouring early to govern the pa&s;&s;ions of nature, he|&s;itate not do declare, &s;uch &s;orrow is, <HI>indeed,</HI> heavenly!"</P>
<P>The whole of the time that Arthur was uttering this &s;peech, the brother and &s;i&s;ter illu&s;trated it by example; and, perhaps, with|out hearing one half of it, continued to &s;mile and weep as if their &s;en&s;ations were beyond the reach of declamation or eloquence. The proude&s;t forms of words are, indeed, wretched mediums to paint any of the grander movements of the &s;oul, and particularly the &s;truggles of honour and affection. The&s;e are un&s;peakable: and when Arthur had pau&s;ed, it was, perhaps, &s;ome relief to the afflicted friends whom he addre&s;&s;ed, that he was prevented from going on by the unexpect|ed &s;ight of the little animal lately mentioned. He had often roved away, and often returned for care&s;s, yet gained the chapel-hou&s;e be|fore Olivia; nay he had made his be&s;t apo|logies there for ab&s;ence, and by every te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="280" REF="289">of tenderne&s;s, had conciliated the fa|vour of Caroline; while Olivia, though the generous purpo&s;e of her vi&s;it ha&s;tened her &s;teps, was &s;carce midway.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e the human heart, good reader; if thou ha&s;t any knowledge of it, thou wilt: Excu&s;e, too, the truly virtuous and re&s;olved Charles and his &s;i&s;ter, if the &s;light &s;urprize of &s;uddenly ob&s;erving a poor truant dog re|turn to his friends, renewed a train of tender &s;orrows which would have at the moment been too powerful for a folio of moralities, even from father Arthur,
<Q>Tho' truths divine come mended from his tongue.</Q></P>
<P>But, what will to thee appear a yet greater weakne&s;s&mdash;if indeed thou art not a delineator&mdash;father Arthur, knowing and feel|ing as he did the hi&s;tory of this quadruped, di&s;mounted in an in&s;tant from his vaulting &s;teed of eloquence, and when Caroline exclaimed, "Ah my poor, poor Fitz! and art thou come to be of the chapel-hou&s;e party&mdash;or did my&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;did&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Henry&mdash;Fitz&mdash;orton
<PB N="281" REF="290">&s;end thee to comfort us?"&mdash;Father Arthur forgot to rea&s;on, but remembered to feel. To him, to Denni&s;on, and to them&s;elves, yea and even to Flore&s;co, it was in a moment di&s;covered, that Olivia was as dear to Charles, and Henry to Caroline, as at any period of their lives; and had any corre&s;ponding te&s;timony been wanting, the following mi&s;|cellaneous conver&s;e would have ari&s;en in proof. "Happy little creature, how &s;leek and &s;mooth he looks!" &s;aid Caroline, con|tinuing her care&s;&s;es; "and have they been very tender to thee, poor fellow?"</P>
<P>"Si&s;ter," &s;aid Charles, as his hand fol|lowed Caroline's along the dog's glo&s;&s;y back, "Henry has told me &s;uch in&s;tances of my Olivia's&mdash;hem&mdash;hem&mdash;of Mi&s;s Clare's par|tial fondne&s;s for this little animal, that I am almo&s;t &s;orry he has quitted her, and yet is it not comfortable to look at any thing which has found favour in the eyes of tho&s;e we love?"</P>
<P>Caroline blu&s;hed a&s;&s;ent. "I am per&s;uad|ed," cried the lieutenant, "the fair hand of
<PB N="282" REF="291">that &s;weet girl has honoured him in this man|ner a thou&s;and times!"</P>
<P>"He &s;tept in Henry's bed-chamber," &s;aid Caroline.&mdash;</P>
<P>"The '&s;quire and young madam were fondling him by turns, even while I was at the ca&s;tle," interpo&s;ed Denni&s;on, "and me|thought the dog, when he lay down and whined piteou&s;ly at my feet&mdash;which he did&mdash;&s;eemed aware that all was not as it &s;hould be." Caroline drew her cheek acro&s;s the dog's forehead, and Flore&s;co went and brought him a &s;weet cake of his own pre|paring, then kneeling down to feed him, told him, whi&s;peringly, "you no &s;peak, ickle ting&mdash;you no &s;peak&mdash;but young lady and ma&s;&s;er '&s;quire love &s;omebody's that you loves, and that loves you dearly.&mdash;I &s;ee dat as plainer than you ickle ting."</P>
<P>While the good Flore&s;co was thus em|ployed, Olivia made her appearance at the chapel-hou&s;e. She &s;tood on the thre&s;hold of the door, which was open, and &s;upporting her&s;elf with one hand by the door-handle,
<PB N="283" REF="292">which trembled as &s;he held it, &s;he pointed with the other to the &s;paniel, as an apology for her intru&s;ion. Then &s;lightly curte&s;ying, &s;he ventured to &s;tep over the thre&s;hold, and with accents of hyblean &s;weetne&s;s, the bloom of a generous heart mounting into her cheek, &s;he a&s;&s;ured Caroline, "that the detention of her favourite lay upon her con&s;cience, and &s;he thought nothing could make her pardon po&s;|&s;ible, but coming her&s;elf to &s;urrender him at its mi&s;tre&s;s's feet. It had the wicked feeling of robbing you of his little faithful heart, and what is there among&s;t the wide circuit of crimes &s;o bad as to &s;teal away the object of one's affections? But he is now re&s;tored, and you mu&s;t try to forgive me."</P>
<P>Caroline felt the very angui&s;h of a truth which reached a deeper &s;entiment than the lo&s;s or even the death of her &s;paniel could create. But to form any idea of the &s;tate into which Charles and his &s;i&s;ter were thrown by this unlooked-for interview, with the cau&s;e of all their admiration and agony, you mu&s;t have a heart, friend, that can enter
<PB N="284" REF="293">into their &s;everal &s;ituations as well in times pa&s;t as pre&s;ent. So that, unle&s;s &s;uch internal evidence is at your command, this whole incident, which might otherwi&s;e have come quite home to "the bu&s;ine&s;s of your bo&s;om," mu&s;t be found mi&s;erably wanting. All that we can do for you, is, to de&s;cribe the mere matters of fact, without a thou&s;andth part of the appertaining emotions and pa&s;&s;ions, and if you have neither fancy or feeling to &s;upply the&s;e, it is not our fault.</P>

<P>NEITHER Charles nor Caroline were able to mark their welcome by a &s;ingle word. They bowed, trembled, blu&s;hed, turned pale; endeavoured to reach a chair, attempted ut|terance, and failed in both: Denni&s;on and father Arthur were &s;carcely more collected, and had it not been for the happy alertne&s;s and urbanity of Flore&s;co, the ho&s;pitalities would have de&s;erted the chapel-hou&s;e on the fir&s;t entrance of its lovely gue&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="294">Olivia, by a very natural con&s;truction, at|tributed this general confu&s;ion, partly to the variety of embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two families, and partly to the &s;ituation in which &s;he found Charles and Caroline at the chapel-hou&s;e, where &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed they felt them&s;elves as exiles almo&s;t within &s;ight of the paternal home from whence they had been driven. In pur|&s;uance of which opinion, &s;he begged to &s;peak a few words to them apart.

<P>"Rob us, I &s;ay, of our inalienable pro|perty in your <HI>&s;ociety,</HI>" re&s;umed Olivia, to the infinite comfort of her hearers, who felt relieved pa&s;t utterance; "I am come, there|fore," &s;he added, "not only to re&s;tore your favourite, but, as a friend, to claim the intere&s;t which you, Mr. Stuart, promi&s;ed to create for me in Caroline's affections; nay I come to a&s;&s;ert my&s;elf tho&s;e claims of &s;ympathy&mdash;of childhood&mdash;of &s;ofte&s;t, tendere&s;t hours&mdash;and if they meet any congenial advocate in your bo&s;oms, will be in&s;tantly rewarded with an
<PB N="287" REF="296">a&s;&s;urance, that this cruel convent &s;cheme&mdash;for there begins your confederacy again&s;t us&mdash;will be wholly laid a&s;ide&mdash;and a more &s;ocial plan, which has been &s;ome time forming in my mind&mdash;adopted; a plan, my <HI>dear</HI> friends,&mdash;you mu&s;t allow me to call you &s;o,&mdash;which includes the felicity of all; and, though it is not yet mature, I can make no farther progre&s;s in it, till you here promi&s;e me you will not throw an in&s;urmountable bar in my way, by putting your plot upon our peace in execution, and &s;o throw down my new rai&s;ed edifice, and bury the happine&s;s of Henry and Olivia in its ruins.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort," continued Olivia, glowing as &s;he proceeded, "my heart, dear and &s;uffering friends, is in the hi&s;tory of all your unmerited misfortunes and di&s;appointments; and I truly con&s;ider them as much my own, as if I even had created them, and am as &s;incerely inte|re&s;ted in their removal."</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and puzzling kind of per|plexed a&s;toni&s;hment, which &s;eized on Charles and his &s;i&s;ter, became again inexpre&s;&s;ible. The words &s;eemed to involve much more "than met the ear;" and although Olivia
<PB N="288" REF="297">intended them to expre&s;s, with the mo&s;t li|beral &s;implicity, her general knowledge of the abbey calamities, the auditors believed they included even a di&s;covery of their unfortunate loves, to which they &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;judging from them&s;elves&mdash;that Olivia had determined to become a martyr.</P>
<P>"It is decreed, by all the powers of ho|nour and tenderne&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "that the ca&s;tle mu&s;t make reparation to the abbey; and, by a union of fortunes, fates, and affections, be for ever of one family."</P>
<P>The equivoque increa&s;ed. "And why this trembling re&s;erve?" &s;aid Olivia. "I will prove to you, &s;weet Caroline," &s;aid &s;he, car|rying her hand to her heart, and gently hold|ing that of Charles&mdash;"I will prove to you both, that this is to be done con&s;i&s;tently with the nice&s;t feelings and duties to &s;uffering friends below, and pitying angels above."</P>
<P>The Gordian knot was now to the appre|hen&s;ion of Charles and Caroline le&s;s difficult to untie.</P>
<P>"After this confe&s;&s;ion," continued Olivia, "it remains with you to &s;end me back to the
<PB N="289" REF="298">ea&s;tle the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful or the mo&s;t di&s;ap|pointed of human beings. I ought to tell you, however, that your compliance will enable me to make our friend Henry of hu|man beings the happie&s;t, and it will be ac|companied by the &s;weete&s;t &s;urpri&s;e in the world; for though I know, and you cannot be ignorant, that it is the neare&s;t wi&s;h and de&s;ign of his heart, that ample atonement &s;hould be made to you for all the pangs you mu&s;t have undergone, before, alas! you were driven to this extremity, the di&s;tre&s;s into which the news of your intention to &s;teal your|&s;elves away from us, has &s;o di&s;ordered him, as well it might, that he can think upon no|thing deci&s;ive, and my proud heart, a&s;piring to gain the conque&s;t of your promi&s;e not to leave us, and my earne&s;t de&s;ire to carry the tidings of my victory to him my&s;elf, has made me dare to undertake the whole matter with|out his knowing or even &s;u&s;pecting it; &s;o that I have my plot too, you &s;ee. Judge, there|fore, what a generous occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf for your exalting me in his e&s;teem. If you permit me in this great in&s;tance to a&s;&s;ure him
<PB N="290" REF="299">of your friend&s;hip, and it can be done in no other way, than by &s;uch a family compact as I have &s;ugge&s;ted, you will thereby rai&s;e the va|lue of mine, and my obligations to you will be everla&s;ting."</P>
<P>What was to be &s;aid? what done by Caro|line or Charles? Even what was done and &s;aid;&mdash;Nothing. The my&s;tery was inextri|cable, yet a &s;trange opening of trembling light, of hope and of happine&s;s, all which had been yielded to the influence of de&s;pair, &s;eemed to break in upon them like a vi&s;ion, or rather day-dream which they knew not how to en|courage or di&s;pel.</P>
<P>"All I at pre&s;ent &s;olicit," rejoined Olivia, earne&s;tly, "is your promi&s;e to adopt no fatal mea&s;ure, that may put it even beyond your own power to make us and your&s;elves, I tru&s;t, happy. O! grant me this, and I will fly with the wing of affection to mature my project: but why do I talk of your granting what neither of you can in con&s;cience refu&s;e? You owe it to your&s;elves&mdash;you owe it to Henry Fitzorton&mdash;you owe it to me. Be|twixt Henry and you, Charles, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="291" REF="300">even a brotherly affection; and my beating heart tells me, it is not wholly without a kin|dred emotion in the bo&s;om of Caroline. I anticipate then your full compliance, and will now therefore go on with my darling &s;cheme, of which you &s;hall have the particulars at my next vi&s;it. But remember, you have both looked a complete a&s;&s;urance, that we have no more to fear from your former in&s;ufferable &s;cheme."</P>
<P>Though it might be &s;incerely &s;aid, that du|ring the delivery of the&s;e &s;entiments,
<Q><L>Soft as the dew from heaven di&s;tills,</L>
<L>Her gentle accents fell;</L></Q>
the di&s;order, &s;urprize, and a thou&s;and &s;en&s;a|tions, known only to the minds which feel them, wholly took from Charles and his &s;i&s;ter the power of &s;peech. Olivia &s;aw a variety of &s;ymptoms, part of which &s;he thought au&s;pi|cious, and part &s;he feared were unfavourable to her de&s;igns. Interpreting, however, their &s;ilence into a kind of mode&s;t a&s;&s;ent, &s;he would have now hurried out of the apartment, had not Charles, with a melancholy but deter|mined
<PB N="292" REF="301">air, a&s;&s;ured her there were invincible rea&s;ons, which, he feared, mu&s;t for ever inter|rupt her benevolent endeavours to unite the families of Fitzorton and Stuart.</P>
<P>"I know every one of tho&s;e rea&s;ons," rejoined Olivia, maintaining her point; "but they are all to be reconciled, my good &s;ir; they are all to be reconciled." The riddle appeared now re&s;olved. The generous ani|mation with which Olivia repeated this a&s;&s;u|rance, brought into the mind of Charles the mo&s;t delicious of all human delu&s;ions. His fancy had been achieving wonders all the time; and now he even &s;uppo&s;ed (what cannot the tender heart?) that Henry had, like him&s;elf, forgot every thing but love, and had told the &s;tory of all their haple&s;s pa&s;&s;ion to Olivia, who had determined, at whatever ri&s;k, to &s;ave them all from the threatened de&s;pair. "O! thou unheard-of excellence! Is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid he, throwing him&s;elf at her feet. "Shall we then owe to thy unparalleled &s;weetne&s;s the mighty ble&s;&s;ing?"</P>
<P>Olivia, believing his rapture proceeded from the pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored again-to
<PB N="293" REF="302">the arms of his friend, replied, with an ardour &s;carcely inferior to his own, "That &s;he was &s;atisfied there was not a wi&s;h, which he, or his enchanting &s;i&s;ter, could form, but the propo|&s;al &s;he &s;hould &s;peedily make would gratify, to its utmo&s;t height.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of this expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eeming to di&s;pel all that remained of the my&s;tery, moved the firm &s;pirit even of Caroline, who, in her turn, cea&s;ed for an in&s;tant to remember her &s;cheme of &s;eque&s;tration, and all the re&s;olves &s;he had made to bid the world an eternal farewell.</P>
<P>But, alas! it was the rhap&s;ody only of a few bli&s;sful moments; yet tho&s;e, who have hearts to feel, might weigh tho&s;e moments again&s;t a thou&s;and in&s;ipid years, and find, in all the dull and freezing truths of the latter, nothing to balance the &s;hort-lived, but heartfelt tran&s;|ports of this delu&s;ive joy.</P>
<P>Obtrude not upon the&s;e children of ima|gination thy more &s;ober rea&s;onings, &s;age read|er, in this their delirium. As well mighte&s;t thou argue with a fever, or declaim again&s;t the fury of a whirlwind. Avaunt thy cata|logue
<PB N="294" REF="303">of cold interrogations.&mdash;"Have they forgot," &s;ay&s;t thou, in the &s;pirit of a man, &s;u|pinely &s;tretching in the elbow-chair of apathy; "have they forgot the long epi&s;tle of victo|rious virtue which they &s;ent, in the conviction of their &s;ouls, to the ca&s;tle of Fitzorton? Has the upright Charles, and the correct Caro|line, &s;o &s;oon annihilated what appeared to be engraven on their heart of hearts? Where is their heroi&s;m, their fortitude, their philo&s;ophy, and that nice internal &s;en&s;e which their parading hi&s;torian would have per&s;uaded us had prompted the glorious &s;acrifice, which virtue demanded?" Yes, redoubted queri&s;t, all the&s;e things were, for the moment, as if they had never been. En&s;laved by a delicious impo&s;&s;ibility, which the heart, inly &s;tirred, made practicable as the plaine&s;t point in na|ture, fancy and affection opened to them the gates of hope, and moved, with more than the lightning's celerity, tho&s;e bars which their own rea&s;on&mdash;peradventure, with all its pliability, &s;trong as thine&mdash;had &s;o &s;olemnly, and &s;o recently, declared were more immoveable than the everla&s;ting hills. In a word, their
<PB N="295" REF="304">heroi&s;m, fortitude, and philo&s;ophy, were what thine would have been, even if thou art more intrepid than Achilles, more gigantic than Ajax, and a better rea&s;oner than Ne&s;tor.</P>

<P>"ALAS!" exclaimed Caroline, "what|ever de&s;tiny intends for us, we mu&s;t be lo&s;t to every thing that is good and lovely in human nature, before we are unmindful of Olivia's kindne&s;s; and her friendly wi&s;hes will be in the nature of ble&s;&s;ings to us, go where we may."</P>
<P>They had by this time reached the other apartment; and Olivia, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had gained ground, proceeded to pur&s;ue her ad|vantages, then in&s;en&s;ibly &s;lid to the door of the chapel-hou&s;e, and was &s;tealing off without &s;eeming to move away. Charles and Caro|line as in&s;en&s;ibly followed. "We were all formed to be of one family," &s;aid Olivia! "Surely your hearts mu&s;t convince you of this! How happy &s;hall we be, when our arrangements are made! Can any thing
<PB N="296" REF="305">interrupt it! Methinks I &s;ee, as in a mirror, the times to come. We are all &s;eated by our fire-&s;ide; the arts, the plea&s;ures, and the affections, &s;miling before us. We &s;hall be all in alliance, in friend&s;hip, in love."</P>
<P>They were now in the path that led from the chapel-hou&s;e to the ca&s;tle, Charles, per|haps without knowing it, pre&s;&s;ed one of Oli|via's hands to his lips, and the other was thrown round the wai&s;t of Caroline. In this manner they walked on, colouring the fairy paradi&s;e of their fancy more highly at every &s;tep. Ah! that it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for Rea&s;on to advance with a frown, and di&s;&s;olve the charm! Yet, how quickly is it done? Under influence of any vehement affection of the heart, the &s;tep is quick, and almo&s;t keeps pace with the emotion. It is incre|dible how &s;oon our three friends were within the bounds of Fitzorton. Olivia had now placed her&s;elf in the middle, wreathing her lovely arms within tho&s;e of Charles and Caroline. Had a &s;entiment, &s;oft as that which Charles might wi&s;h to in&s;pire, animated her bo&s;om, its effects would have been de|mo&s;trated
<PB N="297" REF="306">nearly in the &s;ame way in which &s;he now proved the loving-kindne&s;s, com|pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ympathy of her gentle heart, which all the time felt only what &s;uch feelings allowed; nor had it one throb of a tenderer pa&s;&s;ion for any mortal but her Henry.</P>
<P>The &s;paniel led the way.&mdash;"See," &s;aid Olivia, &s;miling, "that dear thing certainly knows our convention; I find our George calls him Little Fitz. The time, I tru&s;t, is not far off when every one of us &s;hall a&s;&s;ert our &s;hare of property in that worthy little fel|low. Nay, and I predict, that the pro&s;pect from the ca&s;tle to the abbey, will, one day, be as clear and bright as it is now ob&s;cure and cloudy. Methinks half the grand ave|nue, even to the little &s;ide alcove, which is never to be forgotten, looks full of promi&s;e already."</P>
<P>Here was a &s;troke of recollection, which, though intended by Olivia as a memento of her affecting &s;cene with Henry, brought back to Caroline's heart ten thou&s;and feelings, of which Olivia had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="307">Such conver&s;e brought them ab&s;olutely within a few paces of the ca&s;tle gates; at which all three, who had &s;een and heard nothing but them&s;elves, expre&s;&s;ed equal &s;urpri&s;e.&mdash;"O!" cried Olivia, "that the moment were now come in which we might all be pre&s;ented to one another, hand and heart, in the way each be&s;t de&s;ires.&mdash;And why not? It is but an|ticipating the event, and in &s;uch a cau&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>Olivia's hand was upon the gate bell, and a &s;ingle &s;ound was given, ju&s;t as Caroline, from &s;ome &s;ecret impul&s;e, trembled, and begged her to &s;top.</P>
<P>It was a tumultuous and indefinable, as well as inde&s;cribable moment. Charles and Ca|roline Stuart, conducted by Olivia Clare, were at the gate of that ca&s;tle which they intended never more to approach.</P>
<P>A new and unexpected hope, naturally ari&s;ing out of a chain of mi&s;conceptions, as naturally corre&s;ponding to their wi&s;hes, &s;ud|denly expelled de&s;pair. Every pa&s;&s;ion, which was before refu&s;ed admittance, re-entered the bo&s;om, an almo&s;t-invited gue&s;t, and even Rea&s;on &s;eemed, at length, to nod a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="308">"I have a thought," &s;aid Olivia, "how it may even now be contrived;" and, without farther warning, &s;he rung the bell with a force which that thought &s;eemed to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>"Heavens! what have you done?" ex|claimed Caroline, attempting to &s;top the &s;ound, the vibrations trembling from her di&s;|ordered pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Away with re&s;erves!" &s;aid Olivia.&mdash;"My long-promi&s;ed, long-po&s;tponed hand will be given to my beloved Henry when&mdash;O, my heart! there he is!&mdash;you may &s;ee him through the iron work of the gate&mdash;how rejoiced will he be to &s;ee you!&mdash;<HI>I</HI> will undertake to ex|plain.&mdash;Stop&mdash;hide your&s;elves a moment;&mdash;&s;tand behind me, that his &s;urpri&s;e may be the greater."</P>
<P>Charles and Caroline were &s;hot through and through by the &s;econd &s;entence: that &s;entence, like de&s;pair and death, di&s;&s;olved their fairy dream in a moment; they had no ear for more. Their delu&s;ion, their weak|ne&s;s, their affection, their di&s;appointment, their mi&s;ery, were by tho&s;e few words made palpable; and had the gate of the ca&s;tle, and
<PB N="300" REF="309">the ca&s;tle it&s;elf fallen upon them, it would have been deemed a tender mercy. Luckily for them, Olivia was too much bu&s;ied to no|tice their con&s;ternation, in what &s;he had now, at a moment's warning, to &s;ay and to do; and too much taken up with the approach of Henry, who, catching a glimp&s;e of Olivia, ran to receive her, exclaiming&mdash;"My &s;weet Olivia, I have been watching here this hour! We thought we had lo&s;t the trea&s;ure of the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>According to Olivia's arrangements, Charles and Caroline were &s;o &s;ituated that Henry could not &s;ee them in his advance; &s;he heard, therefore, the tender greeting, which was in &s;trict conformity to Henry's wi&s;h to love, and oath, to live for her alone.</P>
<P>Henry opened the gate&mdash;Olivia immedi|ately pre&s;ented her friends. They had re|treated &s;everal paces. Henry &s;aw, and be|came, in an in&s;tant, a &s;tatue of a&s;toni&s;hment! Olivia ran, and, taking their hands, would have advanced. "His joy, you &s;ee, is too great," &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;"I will for ever love and ble&s;s you, Olivia," replied Caroline&mdash;exerting
<PB N="301" REF="310">her&s;elf&mdash;"if you will go with Henry to the ca&s;tle, and &s;uffer us to return to the chapel-hou&s;e. It is for the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of all that this be done! But it mu&s;t be in|&s;tantaneous; for I &s;ee not only Mr. Fitz|orton, but all the family and &s;ervants are pouring upon us, and we &s;hall be di&s;graced and expo&s;ed beyond the pardon even of Olivia."</P>
<P>This petition was made in a manner, and in a voice, that rendered compliance nece&s;|&s;ary. Olivia believing the di&s;grace and ex|po&s;ure alluded to, &s;ugge&s;ted by a too deep, though delicate &s;en&s;e of their &s;ituation as ex|iled children from the abbey, and the beha|viour of their father at the ca&s;tle, an&s;wered&mdash;"You &s;hall be obeyed&mdash;Heaven forbid I &s;hould violate your worthy feelings! Go, then, but remember your promi&s;e; and be prepared to expect the fulfilling of mine.&mdash;You mu&s;t leave our beloved friends to their own plans at pre&s;ent, and hear mine,"&mdash;&s;aid &s;he to Henry, who was now clo&s;e behind her, and who&s;e eyes followed Charles and Caro|line, now turning &s;adly into the path they
<PB N="302" REF="311">had &s;o chearily trod a few minutes before;&mdash;"you mu&s;t not pur&s;ue them, for my word is given. The &s;eries of my&s;teries &s;hall, in due time, be explained." There was not oppor|tunity for &s;aying more; as John, Lady Fitz|orton, and Mr. Clare, with &s;everal of the &s;ervants &s;ummoned by the bell, were gather|ing about Olivia.</P>
<P>She had out&s;taid her time more than two hours, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that dinner was over, or rather had been &s;ent away un|ta&s;ted, each individual wondering what had become of the fair truant. She gratified their curio&s;ity without betraying either her own de&s;igns or the emotions of her chapel-hou&s;e friends, laying the whole blame on her&s;elf for having neglected to take her watch&mdash;"that is, to wind it up," added &s;he, as &s;he per|ceived her father putting it to his ear, de|clared it ticked.&mdash;"Really?" &s;aid &s;he, "does it, indeed? None of my excu&s;es then will do, it &s;eems: well, then, I mu&s;t own my&s;elf a truant, and beg pardon." She &s;upplicated and was forgiven. And cold mu&s;t be the reader who is not convinced &s;he would
<PB N="303" REF="312">have had neither eye or ear to time had a thou&s;and clocks reminded her that dinners of ortolan and de&s;erts of paradi&s;e waited her re|turn.</P>
<P>Charles and Caroline, &s;ave by ejaculations, &s;pake not till they regained the chapel-hou&s;e; and then de&s;iring to pa&s;s an uninterrupted hour in their &s;eparate apartments, they retired to compo&s;e afflicted hearts, in the be&s;t manner they could.</P>

<P>WHEN Henry had an opportunity to conver&s;e with Olivia alone&mdash;an opportunity which he &s;ought with unu&s;ual diligence, for his thoughts fa&s;tened on the foregoing &s;cene with an eagerne&s;s, that, had Olivia been en|dued with one particle of &s;u&s;picion, or been furni&s;hed with any clue to it, would have di&s;|covered the cau&s;e to lie deeper in his bo&s;om than the intere&s;ts of friend&s;hip.&mdash;"I &s;ee," &s;aid Olivia, "you are earne&s;t to know the hi&s;tory of my rencontre with your friend and
<PB N="304" REF="313">mine, my Henry; and though a train of little untimely events have gone blundering on, to the di&s;order of the whole &s;cheme, which I in|tended to have kept a profound &s;ecret, even from you, till all was ripe for di&s;covery, I cannot now but let you into the whole mat|ter; for indeed, Henry, I would not give you the pain of one moment's &s;u&s;pen&s;e for all the &s;chemes upon earth, and even this was plotted for your felicity."</P>
<P>Hereupon &s;he related all the circum&s;tances, from each of which the goodne&s;s of her mind and the tenderne&s;s of her heart were di&s;played &s;o clearly, and with &s;uch force, that penetrated as Henry was to the quick, with the unex|pected &s;ight and as &s;udden departure of Ca|roline, the very glimp&s;e of whom conjured up myriads of ideas which aro&s;e like the &s;pec|tres of departed joy, as from their tombs, in his bo&s;om, he embraced her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and &s;wore &s;he was too generous, too good, and that he was utterly unworthy of her. "But though the plan is impo&s;&s;ible," added he, "your kind wi&s;hes can, in this in|&s;tance,
<PB N="305" REF="314">be accompli&s;hed:&mdash;I &s;hall for ever cheri&s;h a remembrance of them in my grate|ful heart."</P>
<P>"Why do you talk of impo&s;&s;ibilities?" re&s;umed Olivia; "Charles held the &s;ame lan|guage; he, too, &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible! Where, pray, is the difficulty of our making two of the be&s;t people in the world a part of us? I &s;hould blu&s;h with &s;hame for us if I thought we could di&s;po&s;e of more than a third of our income on our&s;elves, and I know of but one difficulty in appropriating &s;ome of the &s;urplus, and that is in reconciling the ac|ceptance of it to minds as proud and noble as our own. But this we mu&s;t meditate upon. I have gained, meanwhile, the one thing need|ful&mdash;Charles and Caroline's implied, though not expre&s;&s;ed promi&s;e, not to leave the cha|pel-hou&s;e till you or I vi&s;it them again."</P>
<P>Henry, the more he heard, the more he admired the generous &s;peaker; but with an agitation that rather &s;eemed to proceed from a tenacity of opinion, than any thing el&s;e in the judgment of Olivia, &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the impracticability of the thing.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="315">"I prote&s;t," exclaimed Olivia, warmly, "you do not enter into my views with half the &s;pirit, my dear Henry, I might have ex|pected, from your friend&s;hip to the Stuarts, and your love to me. I could almo&s;t call you unkind&mdash;for is not Charles your friend, and is not Caroline his &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;By-the-bye, Henry, I am a&s;toni&s;hed how you have guarded your heart again&s;t the&mdash;I &s;hould have thought&mdash;<HI>unerring</HI> darts of this all-conquering girl. Though the deep &s;hades of melancholy are ca&s;t about her, one di&s;covers &s;uch ineffable &s;weetne&s;s, grace, and beauty, through their veils, that I really could not help thinking, as I beheld her, nothing but the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or prejudice of old habits&mdash;&s;uch as our being born, bred, reared, and educated together&mdash;could ac|count for it;&mdash;and although I verily believe my heart would break, and my death en&s;ue&mdash;Heaven knows, I hope it would&mdash;on the lo&s;s, or the &s;lighte&s;t abatement of your tenderne&s;s for me, I &s;hould have enough of candour in the mid&s;t of my de&s;pair almo&s;t to ju&s;tify the infidelity that would, nay, that ought&mdash;for how is the lo&s;s of Henry Fitzorton to be re|paired?&mdash;
<PB N="307" REF="316">yes that <HI>ought</HI> to &s;horten my days! Your affection has taught me to be ambitious, Henry.

<P>In this artle&s;s and animated addre&s;s, as there were &s;o many points to wound, and &s;o many to heal, Henry &s;truck a kind of balance be|tween both; and in the compromi&s;e, his gratitude and admiration of Olivia &s;eemed almo&s;t to outweigh his love of Caroline, and made it even more impo&s;&s;ible than it had ever been before, to declare in who&s;e favour the trepidations of the &s;cale preponderated.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation ended with Henry's de|&s;iring to know the particulars of Olivia's plan.</P>
<P>"The particulars," replied Olivia, "would run into too much length for the time allowed us to detail it; but the &s;ub&s;tance is&mdash;if it met your approbation&mdash;to make Charles and Ca|roline

<PB N="309" REF="318">they were dear to the man &s;he loved? If thy heart be as the unmelting &s;nows on the mountains of Scandinavia, thaws it not at the contemplation of &s;uch good|ne&s;s?

<PB N="310" REF="319">of his doating heart, ju&s;t torn from his longing arms and &s;training eyes.</P>
<P>But the generous romance of Olivia's ad|venture increa&s;ed the griefs &s;he intended to heal, or rather tore open again tho&s;e deep-mouthed wounds which &s;he little &s;uppo&s;ed had bled &s;o long; much le&s;s did &s;he imagine her virtuous &s;elf the innocent cau&s;e. On this &s;ubject, her "ignorance was a&s;&s;uredly her bli&s;s," and it would not have been "folly" only, but wickedne&s;s in the extreme, to have "made her wi&s;e."</P>
<P>Henry, to do him ju&s;tice, now concealed from her with the mo&s;t generous and tender care, &s;o &s;oon as he found no di&s;covery had taken place at the chapel-hou&s;e, all that could lead to a fact, which he every hour received &s;ome fre&s;h conviction, would, were it but &s;urmi&s;ed, plant an eternal thorn in the brea&s;t of the woman he had &s;worn to a dying fa|ther, who took his oath to the "regi&s;tering angel," that he would make his wife, and whom even in the &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion which &s;hook his heart, he felt had claims upon him independent of all bonds.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="320">Yet, Olivia made this nece&s;&s;ary conceal|ment of Henry's emotions the more difficult; &s;he imputed the occa&s;ional cloud that, in de|&s;pite of his utmo&s;t caution, over&s;hadowed his brow, and the involuntary &s;igh that &s;tole from his bo&s;om, &s;olely to the lo&s;s of his father Sir Armine, and the ab&s;ence of his beloved friend Charles; a day &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed without her reminding him that the virtues of the former en&s;ured him that heaven to which his &s;oul had a&s;cended, and from whence it looked be|nignly down, and ble&s;&s;ed that forgiving &s;pirit which led his beloved Henry to &s;uccour the children of his mortal foe, who&s;e vices ren|dered tho&s;e children the more perfect ob|jects of pardon and of love.</P>
<P>"Certain I am," would &s;he &s;ay, lifting her beautiful eyes to heaven, "Sir Armine approves all we may or <HI>can</HI> do for tho&s;e af|flicted and deeply injured beings. His &s;acred form was before my mind's eye, as I entered the chapel-hou&s;e&mdash;he &s;miled, methought, as I ro&s;e above the &s;hrinking diffidence of my own timid nature, and the fancy that he did &s;o, gave me confidence in what I &s;poke. As
<PB N="312" REF="321">I came back, &s;uch a glow &s;pread over my heart, that I have &s;ince con&s;idered it as an emanation &s;ent from the bright region in which he now re&s;ides, to &s;ignify that even God him&s;elf, in who&s;e &s;acred pre&s;ence he now moves, pronounced what I had under|taken was good. Your image too, deare&s;t Henry, came in with its encouragements. Henry will be &s;o &s;urprized&mdash;&s;o plea&s;ed, thought I&mdash;O my little offering of good will is abundantly overpaid! Why, Henry, will not every body do kind things! &s;ince the &s;malle&s;t urbanity is &s;ure to be returned in bli&s;s a thou&s;and fold! Virtue &s;eems to me to be common intere&s;t, my friend, and all the powers of earth and heaven reward it with happy feelings even to u&s;ury. Sweet, de|jected, drooping Caroline! noble-hearted, ge|nerous Charles! how infinitely am I already indebted to ye! How can I repay my ob|ligations?"</P>
<P>Indeed, every object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf was productive of &s;omething de&s;igned to cre|ate the felicity of that heart which it kept in continual agitation. As &s;he ended the above
<PB N="313" REF="322">effu&s;ions, which were poured forth on the very evening of the eventful day that &s;he arrived from the chapel-hou&s;e, &s;he ca&s;t her eyes on that little adherent who has already been &s;o fruitful of adventure in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory.&mdash;"As I live," &s;aid &s;he, "this dear little Fitz is with us again! He already anticipates the time when we &s;hall all be of one hou&s;e, and even now con&s;iders him&s;elf as one of the family. But, methinks, he ought to have gone back with his &s;weet mi&s;tre&s;s too, now &s;he is unhappy."</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for Henry not to be at once di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and delighted by the&s;e kind revivals of what it was for the happine&s;s of both Olivia and him&s;elf to forget.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>MEANTIME the amiable brother and &s;i&s;ter, whom we &s;o lately reconducted to the chapel-hou&s;e, had a conference with father Arthur as &s;oon as they were able to appear before him. The &s;ubject was, their prepara|tions
<PB N="314" REF="323">to leave the neighbourhood. They in|genuou&s;ly related to him the particulars of their di&s;cour&s;e with Olivia, nor did they con|ceal the &s;trong emotions of their hearts.</P>
<P>"It is time to make an e&s;cape from our|&s;elves," &s;aid Charles. "Our hearts are not to be tru&s;ted. Every hour we continue here is replete with pain and peril; and the very air we breathe is full of temptation. I cannot an&s;wer for my&s;elf if I remain any longer in this &s;trait betwixt Scylla and Carybdis&mdash;the abbey and the ca&s;tle; and my &s;i&s;ter concurs with me in thinking, that when &s;he is pro|perly and honourably placed, &s;omething may be determined as to my&s;elf. Let us then lo&s;e no time, for I will hone&s;tly confe&s;s, a &s;econd vi&s;it from Olivia, which &s;he has given us rea&s;on to expect, would perhaps prove too &s;trong for all that rea&s;on, piety, or prayer could urge."</P>
<P>"A &s;econd rencontre of that kind would, at lea&s;t, afflict us both, to no good end," &s;aid Caroline; "and as my fixed and &s;olemn purpo&s;e is to go, the &s;ooner that purpo&s;e is fulfilled the better."</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="324">Caroline uttered the&s;e few words with much delay and difficulty. The &s;ight of Henry Fitzorton, and the conte&s;t it produced in her gentle bo&s;om, had thrown her into &s;uch a &s;tate of agony, that &s;he remained &s;everal hours &s;peechle&s;s in her chamber.</P>
<P>Late on the following day &s;he aro&s;e and came into the hall of the chapel-hou&s;e, pale almo&s;t as if &s;he were indeed in her &s;hrowd, and feeble even to &s;taggering. But her principles knew no weakne&s;s; and what was due to virtue &s;he &s;till re&s;olved to pay, without one appeal from the rigours of ju&s;tice to the &s;oftne&s;s of love.&mdash;"O father Arthur!" &s;aid &s;he, "We have confided with you our hearts&mdash;di&s;po&s;e of us before any di&s;covery takes place which may make the angel-hearted Olivia as wretch|ed as our&s;elves. Perhaps, already &s;omething has tran&s;pired from the late fatal interview. We rely on your in&s;tant &s;ervices. To your moral guidance, O dear adopted parent, we commit our&s;elves."</P>
<P>Denni&s;on, who was within the hearing of this, threw him&s;elf upon his aged knees, and embracing by turns tho&s;e of Charles and
<PB N="316" REF="325">father Arthur, and then taking the hand of Caroline, humbly entreated, that &s;ince his dear young mi&s;tre&s;s was re&s;olved on retiring from the world, that it might be in &s;ome a&s;ylum where the attendance of an old and faithful &s;ervant would be admitted;&mdash;de|claring, that if he were denied this, he would build him&s;elf a hut, at the gate of the con|vent that inclo&s;ed her, and live and die near the daughter of his dear lady, to who&s;e family he had &s;worn the dedication of him&s;elf while life remained.&mdash;"So it will be in vain to &s;hut me out," cried the old man; "remember Mi&s;s, remember young 'Squire, what I &s;aid in my letter,&mdash;'where &s;he lives there will I live; where &s;he lodges there will I lodge.'&mdash;I know what the true Lady Stuart, as &s;he lay dying, &s;aid,&mdash;I &s;hall never forget it&mdash;'Denni&s;on,' &s;aid &s;he, 'poor Denni&s;on, you are an old &s;tandard of my dear father's family, and mu&s;t needs love my children;' and then &s;he whi&s;pered &s;omething about what might come to pa&s;s&mdash;what, alas! has happened&mdash;&s;ure &s;he was a prophete&s;s! I am &s;ure &s;he is a &s;aint, and a &s;pirit in heaven, at the right hand
<PB N="317" REF="326">of the Lord God, as &s;ure as I am now &s;peak|ing upon earth.&mdash;Reverend Sir, do not think of letting me leave my young lady. If you part me from her, my heart will break, and my death &s;hall be upon your head&mdash;aye, I would &s;ay &s;o, if you were my father by blood."</P>
<P>"We will all go, my hone&s;t fellow," ex|claimed Arthur, melted with his earne&s;t and &s;imple eloquence, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting Charles and Caroline to rai&s;e him up:&mdash;"I have already been turning the matter in my mind, and think it behoves all of us to depart, for a time at lea&s;t, from a place which is, as you &s;ay, my dear child, be&s;et with danger. The day may arrive when &s;ome of us may return to it with joy. Be that as it may, I tru&s;t you will put your&s;elves wholly under my guidance; and convincing your&s;elves that I have your be&s;t intere&s;t, temporal and eternal, in view, I mu&s;t have your promi&s;e to &s;ubmit unque&s;tioned, however my&s;terious may be my &s;eemings, to what I &s;hall propo&s;e, and to follow wherever I &s;hall lead."</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="327">Having vowed the mo&s;t implicit and unli|mited obedience, and Denni&s;on's worthy mind being made ea&s;y, the re&s;t remained with the good Arthur, who told them, that on the third day, counting from that in which he &s;poke, their route &s;hould be fixed, and their journey might begin on the morning of the fourth. In truth, the &s;agacious mona&s;tic had already made his arrangements; for he &s;oon perceived the chapel-hou&s;e would be no re&s;t|ing-place; and as well read in the weakne&s;s of the human heart, as in its &s;trength, he thought it fool-hardine&s;s to &s;et virtue too &s;evere a ta&s;k, or impo&s;e on her approved votaries mere trials of &s;trength&mdash;a &s;aving knowledge this, which our &s;piritual guides do not always know, &s;ince numberle&s;s are the misfortunes and the crimes which have ari&s;en from ex|perimenting upon the principles, and as it were &s;crewing them up "to the top of their bent," to &s;ee what degree of ten&s;ion they can bear, and laying in their way unnece&s;&s;ary dif|ficulties. He had little to apprehend from the e&s;tabli&s;hed rectitude of tho&s;e whom he called and loved as his children; but now that
<PB N="319" REF="328">he was more completely in the &s;ecret of their hearts, he &s;aid they were &s;urrounded by &s;nares which virtue her&s;elf had &s;et, and that their own &s;en&s;ibility was lying in ambu&s;h to entrap them; a &s;peedy refuge was, therefore, expe|dient, and his hone&s;t heart had been and was &s;till diligent to prepare it.</P>
<P>But, &s;hort as was the &s;pace betwixt the de|termination and the departure of this little party, it was filled with incidents of great ac|count to each individual.</P>
<P>The point was &s;carce agreed on, as to the time of &s;etting out, ere True George, in that &s;ort of ha&s;te which made him blow as if he was labouring with an a&s;thma, and in which indeed he performed all his commi&s;&s;ions, de|livered a packet to Charles&mdash;gave &s;everal re|verential bows, with like rapidity in di&s;tinct re&s;pect, to every one pre&s;ent&mdash;apportioning his bend to the degree of claim which each had on his affections, and then &s;et off with the &s;ame &s;peed he entered.</P>
<P>The billet contained the&s;e few words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>That you may not &s;uffer by &s;urpri&s;e, ex|pect,
<PB N="320" REF="329">within an hour from your receipt of this, a friendly call from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOHN FITZORTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Though the &s;urpri&s;e was broken by this note of annunciation, the curio&s;ity which it excited, as to what might be the motive of the vi&s;it, was extreme.</P>
<P>Charles read the billet aloud to his friends, and the expectation of &s;omething extraordi|nary became general. They knew, indeed, that the writer of it would &s;ay nothing with|out a meaning, and that his meaning was al|ways characteri&s;tic of him&s;elf, appo&s;ite to &s;ome point that he believed to be &s;trong and momentous. They laid no &s;tre&s;s on the me&s;|&s;enger's bu&s;tling addre&s;s, for as it was a maxim of old Denni&s;on's to do bu&s;ine&s;s a round trot, &s;o was it young George's to fetch and carry me&s;&s;ages at full gallop; but with this line of variation between the two, that Denni&s;on ge|nerally, as has been noted, conver&s;ed with him&s;elf or others all the way going and coming, and George &s;eldom &s;poke any &s;entence but that which made up his me&s;&s;age, which he would in repetition mutter to him&s;elf, le&s;t he
<PB N="321" REF="330">&s;hould drop a &s;yllable on the road, for miles together; and if the errand had nothing verbal in it, he would conduct him&s;elf exactly as he did at the chapel-hou&s;e, on the delivery of John's billet.</P>
<P>From the hurry-&s;curry of George, there|fore, nothing could be gathered by tho&s;e who were acquainted with his paces, although the&s;e alone, to any one who knew him not, would have been &s;ufficiently alarming to denote an affair of life or death; whereas, in fact, he would bring you a toothpick or a challenge with equal di&s;patch.</P>
<P>Yet no one at the chapel-hou&s;e, except Charles, had &s;een John Fitzorton &s;ince the death of Sir Armine, or the con&s;piracy of Sir Gui&s;e. Charles &s;ilently interpreted the interview, partly to his delay in returning to the regiment, and partly to di&s;regard of the captain's admonitions. Caroline, knowing John's high &s;en&s;e of honour and in&s;ult, had her &s;ilent fears al&s;o.</P>
<P>While they were involved in the labyrinth of the&s;e conjectures, the object of them ap|peared, to the moment of his appointment;
<PB N="322" REF="331">and after a more re&s;pectful bow than it was his practice to give, and which was a deference he paid &s;ometimes to real misfortunes, but never to the affectation of them, nor indeed to fal&s;e preten&s;ions of any kind, he de&s;ired to exchange a few words with Mr. Stuart, and they went out together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>"LIEUTENANT," &s;aid John, "I hate letter-writing&mdash;not the trouble, but the vexa|tious inefficiency of it. It multiplies words, and embarra&s;&s;es meaning; to explain which, we run into replies and rejoinders, till we imperceptibly involve our&s;elves in a corre|&s;pondence. The chaos of ob&s;curity is then complete. I come, therefore, to an&s;wer your re&s;ignation per&s;onally: I accept that re&s;ignation: I think I &s;hould have acted as you have done, in your &s;ituation. You have done nothing to di&s;honour the commi&s;&s;ion you received; but I do not &s;ee how you could have publicly held it to the &s;atisfaction of your private feel|ings,
<PB N="323" REF="332">which are not only the be&s;t judges, but the &s;ure&s;t rewards and puni&s;hments of a man's actions."</P>
<P>Charles's cheek began to glow.</P>
<P>John pau&s;ed, and extended his hand, which Charles met half way.</P>
<P>"It would be tyranny," continued John, "to impo&s;e on the &s;on of the wretched and pe&s;tilent man, who has contributed to murder my father, any thing that has the air or weight of an obligation."</P>
<P>"O, in&s;upportable!" &s;aid Charles, &s;tretch|ing out both his arms to their utmo&s;t width, as if to figure the immea&s;urable burden removing from his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Your lieutenancy is, therefore, el&s;ewhere di&s;po&s;ed," proceeded John; "and of your father's attempt on the &s;acred life of mine&mdash;but let me hurry from the dreadful circum|&s;tance! Alas! not millions of &s;uch lives as&mdash;but I will not name him to you&mdash;could atone even for imagining the death of Sir Armine Fitzorton. Why is there not a law, my friend, that the parent &s;hould con&s;ign to immediate death a thankle&s;s child, and the
<PB N="324" REF="333">di&s;honoured child be the &s;anctioned execu|tioner of an unnatural father."</P>
<P>"What le&s;s can expunge the &s;pot which infamy entails on a family to all po&s;terity!" ejaculated Charles.</P>
<P>"Po&s;terity it&s;elf," replied John, "and the example of children like my friend Charles&mdash;but all that was in the power of Sir Gui&s;e has, reluctantly, been done. This packet,"&mdash;here John took &s;ome papers from his pocket, and de&s;ired Charles would depo&s;it them in his own,&mdash;"this packet will explain every thing, I tru&s;t, to your &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e it is both to me and to you an act of ju&s;tice, and not of obligation. I am, as haply you &s;u&s;pect, put, by your own lips, and from my own ob|&s;ervation, in the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;orrows of your heart. They are profound&mdash;they are pitiable&mdash;but&mdash;they are not without a parallel."</P>
<P>"Alas! no!" &s;aid Charles; "they find one no le&s;s bitter in the bo&s;om of&mdash;" Charles was ju&s;t about to pronounce the name of his &s;i&s;ter, when, checking him&s;elf, he left the &s;entence unfini&s;hed. He thought it unne|ce&s;&s;ary to commit or involve Caroline, the
<PB N="325" REF="334">knowledge of who&s;e &s;imilar di&s;appointments could lead to no good effect; &s;ince, like his own, her pa&s;&s;ion was hopele&s;s. It was one of the maxims &s;ettled by John's noble di&s;po|&s;ition, as a rule of conduct, never to make a good mind betray it&s;elf; nor, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;uffer a bad one to e&s;cape its own &s;nare. In the latter ca&s;e, he would hurry on a rogue to confe&s;&s;ion of villainy by every terrifying power. In the former, he would prevent confe&s;&s;ion by all the kind interventions that offered. He &s;aw the worthy Charles embar|ra&s;&s;ed; and without pu&s;hing the generous &s;oul into painful declaration, or waiting to gratify curio&s;ity, he relieved him, by &s;aying, "Yes, dear Charles; they find another where po&s;&s;ibly you little expected&mdash;in the bo&s;om of a friend&mdash;even in him who now gives you the hand of &s;ympathy," &s;aid John.</P>
<P>"In your's!" exclaimed Charles, with all the empha&s;is of amazement.</P>
<P>"Even &s;o," re&s;ponded John. "You are among&s;t the number of tho&s;e who impute to the coldne&s;s of my nature what proceeds from the vigour of my di&s;cipline. Imitate that
<PB N="326" REF="335">vigour&mdash;emulate that di&s;cipline. To &s;uch an end I di&s;clo&s;e and confide it with you. I have been, for eleven years, perhaps I am &s;till, as much devoted to Olivia as your&s;elf, or as Henry, I now find, is to Caroline. Had I not di&s;covered her affection for my brother Henry, I would have tried the fortune of my rougher heart, or at lea&s;t ruder manners, and might po&s;&s;ibly have been your rival. But her whole &s;oul was anticipated; and had you, my friend, or had even an enemy of worth and honour, pre-engaged it, I would have acted as I have done&mdash;<HI>promoted her happine&s;s with the object of her affection.</HI> This, my friend, is not the &s;ally of a hero, but the common duty of an hone&s;t man; for though it were to be wi&s;hed &s;he could have in&s;pired the man of her choice with an equal pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he had better wed a man of honour whom &s;he tenderly loves, than one to whom &s;he is wholly indifferent; which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e, had &s;he fallen to the lot of either you or me, my friend. To &s;truggle honourably, and &s;ilently," con|tinued John, "to convert unavailing hope, and unwarranted jealou&s;y, into an hone&s;t endea|vour
<PB N="327" REF="336">to &s;erve her with the man of her heart, was all that remained."</P>
<P>Charles admitted the fact, but gave a heavy &s;igh at the words "wholly indifferent;" for though he knew the&s;e words de&s;cribed the truth of his own ca&s;e, and had re&s;olved never to &s;ee Olivia again, he could not hear that truth without an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Any other conduct, you are aware," re&s;umed John, "would have aggravated my di&s;appointment, and driven Olivia to the nece&s;&s;ity of refu&s;ing me; the di&s;tre&s;s of which to her, and the di&s;grace to me, would have been equal."</P>
<P>Charles con&s;idered this inference as incon|trovertible, yet could not help thinking the worthy &s;peaker more a hero than a lover.</P>
<P>"I therefore pro&s;ecuted my plan," con|tinued John,&mdash;"a &s;evere &s;y&s;tem of &s;elf-denial: but do not think that I &s;uffered le&s;s on that account. I have an aver&s;ion to confidences in &s;orrow, whether from pride, or a better motive, I know not; but mi&s;erable feelings are be&s;t kept to one's &s;elf, methinks, though I will communicate matter that is comfortable
<PB N="328" REF="337">with any man. The&s;e remarks are &s;uper|fluous, as it is impo&s;&s;ible either you or I can indulge a farther hope of Olivia, who is now little le&s;s than my brother's&mdash;wife."</P>
<P>Betwixt the utterance of the words "bro|ther" and "wife," there was a long line of circumvallation drawn by John's heart, which now began vi&s;ibly to &s;ound the alarm.</P>
<P>"Ah! my friend," ejaculated he, "that Henry were as &s;en&s;ible to her merits as either you or I!&mdash;but &s;he cannot make him mi|&s;erable! Alas! if &s;he &s;hould, in the end, be &s;o her&s;elf! that would be a hard &s;troke on us both." John took out his handker|chief, and applied it to that part of his face which demanded it not, violently prote&s;ting at the &s;ame time, that the cold in his head&mdash;then fir&s;t di&s;covered&mdash;almo&s;t di&s;tracted him.</P>
<P>"As&mdash;I&mdash;&s;ay&mdash;as," continued John; "excu&s;e me, Charles&mdash;I am, as you mu&s;t perceive, getting quite hoar&s;e&mdash;I &s;hall not be able to &s;peak!&mdash;In &s;hort, let us remember&mdash;let us never forget&mdash;let us have it eternally in recollection&mdash;In &s;hort, you &s;ee clearly&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I do, alas! I do, mo&s;t clearly," &s;aid Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="338">"The&s;e keen ea&s;terly winds, my friend, force the water from one's eyes," exclaimed John.</P>
<P>Charles, looking on the weather-cock of the chapel, which &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the &s;pot where they di&s;cour&s;ed, and &s;eeing it point due we&s;t, whi&s;pered to his own heart, that John was no more of a philo&s;opher than him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But John tried again&mdash;"Let us remem|ber," taking Charles by the hand, "that we are brother-&s;ufferers&mdash;brother-&s;oldiers&mdash;and men of honour. You &s;ee how I bear it, my friend,&mdash;bear it as&mdash;"</P>
<P>Three hems&mdash;ending in as many coughs&mdash;could not &s;tifle John's &s;en&s;ations; for the tears, as if in perfect de&s;pite of his efforts to conceal them, &s;treamed along his face; and it was in vain that he pretended, in this extre|mity, to &s;ub&s;titute a weakne&s;s in the eyes as the cau&s;e of that effu&s;ion which flowed from the tenderne&s;s of his heart. Perceiving this,&mdash;"Behold," &s;aid he, "one of the many cur&s;es of what is called &s;ocial &s;orrow. I have had ten thou&s;and of the&s;e momentary infir|mities
<PB N="330" REF="339">in my &s;olitary walks&mdash;in my chamber&mdash;in my tent&mdash;and even in the field of battle, where public duty prevented private ob&s;erva|tion; yet &s;till it was an affair of the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> heart that involved none but my&s;elf, and did not expo&s;e the mind that agonized. Not that I ought to be a&s;hamed of it," continued John, re&s;uming him&s;elf; "for with this hand will I give away, at the altar, that of Olivia, to him only whom &s;he can love; and in order, my friend, to prove, that you and I love her &s;till, love her as we ought to do, let us take every opportunity to make her hu&s;band&mdash;"</P>
<P>John declared a fly had got into his throat.</P>
<P>"Her hu&s;band as proud of&mdash;of&mdash;of po&s;&mdash;po&s;&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her&mdash;"</P>
<P>The fly had &s;omehow leapt from his throat again into his eyes.</P>
<P>"As&mdash;happy, I &s;ay, as&mdash;had it plea&s;ed Heaven to have inclined her heart to either of us&mdash;we&mdash;&s;hould have been&mdash;"</P>
<P>The latter part of this &s;entence, in point of tone and empha&s;is, was many degrees lower than the former. One was in uni&s;on with the loftie&s;t &s;entiment of the human mind, the
<PB N="331" REF="340">other attuned to the trembling vibrations of the human heart. But it was the &s;ame noble compo&s;ition of nature in all her grand and tender movements.</P>
<P>John rallied, and was re-a&s;&s;uming the philo&s;opher, when ob&s;erving Charles &s;hake his head, "I will yield the point," exclaimed John&mdash;an&s;wering to that &s;ignificant &s;hake. "We have talked each other into this con|dition. Another ble&s;&s;ed effect of confidence! I told you what would come of it. I prote&s;t to you, Charles, more words have been wa&s;ted and more weakne&s;s di&s;played in this &s;hort interview, than in my eleven years of &s;ilent forbearance; and yet I confided only that you might not think your &s;ufferings and &s;ituation unexampled. You are right, my friend, this is no moment to be magnani|mous; yet our being men of &s;en&s;ibility, in|volved in &s;imilar di&s;appointment, prevents not our being men of honour. We are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other's misfortune, and may &s;ecretly re&s;ort to one another for &s;upport and &s;ympathy, &s;hould the approaching event require greater &s;trength than our own."</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="341">John perceived that Charles's heart was full, but his arms open. He run into tho&s;e with an ardency that was returned with an ingenuous zeal. The friends then bade each other farewell. John ha&s;tened back to the ca&s;tle, fir&s;t a&s;&s;uring Charles, "that he had but half performed his errand, and that he &s;hould &s;ee him and his party again, on &s;ome momentous bu&s;ine&s;s he could not then &s;tay to impart."</P>
<P>"Noble, high-feeling, and high-thoughted man!" &s;aid Charles, apo&s;trophizing in &s;olilo|quy as he pa&s;&s;ed on: "What a moment has he cho&s;en for the di&s;covery! He knew my do|me&s;tic &s;orrows to be deep and mighty, the ruins of my fortune to be complete, the di&s;|grace of my family to be de&s;olating&mdash;and the agonies of my heart to &s;well almo&s;t to bur&s;t|ing; then, then it was that he came to &s;eparate the &s;ufferer from the offender, to embrace me as an unfortunate friend, &s;hew me that we were involved in one common calamity, and taught me to bear it&mdash;not by the &s;tubborn example of the cynic's virtue, which is but another word for affectation or
<PB N="333" REF="342">&s;tupidity, but by convincing me he &s;truggled with a di&s;appointment mighty as my own!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the time that John Fitzorton had received the re&s;ignation of the lieuten|ancy, he was truly anxious to atone for the lo&s;s which that unfortunate young &s;oldier, whom he at once loved and pitied, &s;u&s;tained by an action which he felt to be the con&s;equence of a brave, delicate, and independent &s;pirit. And on conver&s;ing with Henry, he found his brother officer labouring under the various ills and injuries which Charles him&s;elf re|capitulated in this &s;oliloquy. John, therefore, without wa&s;ting time or words, in barren and o&s;tentatious compa&s;&s;ion, or &s;peaking to Henry a &s;ingle word about tender di&s;appoint|ments, &s;eriou&s;ly, although &s;ilently meditated how he might e&s;&s;entially &s;erve this young man, and his no le&s;s meritorious, no le&s;s &s;uffering &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Indeed, his attachment to their virtues had all along been as &s;incere as the dete&s;tation
<PB N="334" REF="343">he had borne to the vices of their father; nor had any in&s;ults which he had him&s;elf &s;u&s;|tained from the one, the power to affect his unprejudiced and clear-judging mind from what was due to the others. Not even the outrage of Sir Gui&s;e at Ad&s;ell fore&s;t &s;hook his impartiality, although the interdicted par|ticulars of that outrage, all fatal as they were, had come to his knowledge. No immediate opportunity, however, pre&s;ented it&s;elf: it was a point of delicacy and difficulty; and John not only rejected confidence in his &s;orrows but his benevolence, whenever it could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided; and till the hour of giving them effect, his mo&s;t generous de&s;igns lay hid in his bo&s;om. But the mi&s;carriage of one, two, three, or three-and-twenty efforts, did not di&s;cour|age him from going on till he &s;ucceeded; his maxim <HI>then</HI> was to impart the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of his lucky endeavours, con&s;idering the re&s;t as irrelevant. He would however much oftener pre&s;ent the happy piece of fortune he had procured to the per&s;on de&s;erving it, without annexing to it any hi&s;tory at all, which he u&s;ually con&s;idered as a bait for applau&s;e, on
<PB N="335" REF="344">which he looked down with all the pride of a magnificent &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Several days elap&s;ed before John could &s;a|tisfy him&s;elf as to the mode of redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of his two friends at the chapel-hou&s;e, although he was early determined that the chief author of the calamity &s;hould be in&s;trumental in its relief.</P>
<P>At length, an accident brought about, without any difficulty, what had co&s;t the per|&s;evering John &s;o much labour in thought, and &s;o much of that labour in vain.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory mu&s;t look back a little. Our companions in this work will not have for|gotten that the per&s;on fixed on by John to carry his billet to Charles was True George.</P>
<P>That faithful fellow who had, in his heart, the very &s;implicity and &s;incerity of goodne&s;s, was acce&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;perity which was now about to gild the chapel-hou&s;e. He had, with un&s;peakable a&s;&s;iduity, &s;ought to wean the affections of Jenny Atwood from the unworthy object who too long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, and place them in his own hone&s;t bo&s;om; and though he made &s;low progre&s;s,
<PB N="336" REF="345">he had <HI>begun an impre&s;&s;ion;</HI> the fir&s;t vi&s;ible mark of which was her &s;uffering him to mention the baronet's name with a part of the indignation it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Indeed, the vile and abject &s;pirit of her quondam lover, manife&s;ted both before and after the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-&s;cheme, the ba&s;e in|ju&s;tice practi&s;ed again&s;t the re&s;pectable Fitz|ortons, and his own children, and more e&s;|pecially the marriage with Mrs. Tempe&s;t, and which was not like poor Jane's a mock, but <HI>bona fide</HI> a real wedding, after a time worked together for George's good. She began to find a kind of <HI>relief</HI> in his com|pany, which had before been burden&s;ome. She &s;uffered his little attentions, which for|merly &s;he had declared were intolerable; and always in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her good-will and e&s;teem for his virtues, &s;he by degrees, and in&s;en&s;ibly, encouraged his flame, not that &s;he could yet be &s;aid to return his love.</P>
<P>She had &s;till a child which had been the fruit of her former ill-requited and unfortu|nate pa&s;&s;ion, and by that tenure the faithle&s;s &s;educer had &s;ome hold on her maternal &s;en|&s;ibility:
<PB N="337" REF="346">yet, &s;he was plea&s;ed to merit the daily increa&s;ing tenderne&s;s of a worthy man.</P>
<P>One evening as George returned from an errand his ma&s;ter Henry had &s;ent him on, Jenny perceived his eyes were filled with tears, which he in vain attempted to conceal. "What is the matter, George?" &s;aid &s;he in a voice &s;ofter than &s;he had ever before ad|dre&s;&s;ed him, putting her handkerchief at the &s;ame time up to his face. Unable to make any reply, he &s;at for &s;ome moments rocking him&s;elf in a chair, and then broke forth into the following exclamation, interrupted by a torrent of grief, which had its foun|tain in his generous heart: "I do not like, Mrs. Jenny, to bring up the name of that Sir&mdash;Somebody in your hear|ing, becau&s;e I would not have you think I di&s;parage <HI>him</HI> to make you have a better liking to <HI>me;</HI> but I would not have what he did no longer ago than ye&s;terday to an&s;wer for, if I might have the whole world! no! not to have you."</P>
<P>"Ye&s;terday!" repeated Jenny.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="347">"But I may as well &s;peak of it as ano|ther," &s;aid George. "The unnatural&mdash;gen|tleman&mdash;no &s;ooner brought home the madam, whom he had married, than he picked a quarrel with the poor Lieutenant and Mi&s;s Stuart, and <HI>turned them out of doors!</HI> and the worthy po|pi&s;h doctor you have heard &s;o much of, took them into his little chapel-hou&s;e, where they now are almo&s;t di&s;tracted; for thus runs the rumour in the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>"The hard-hearted&mdash;per&s;on," continued George, &s;till &s;inking the name, "even re|fu&s;ed &s;ending their wearing apparel; this, al&s;o, was reported; and if it had not been," proceeded George, "for my ma&s;ter, and good Mr. Denni&s;on, they might have wanted a mor&s;el of bread."</P>
<P>"Mor&s;el of bread!" &s;aid Jenny. "Gra|cious God!&mdash;Why, have not they 500l. a|year each, left to them by Sir Marmaduke Stuart, their relation, in the We&s;t Indies?"</P>
<P>"Not they, poor &s;ouls! nor five hundred farthings; and as for Sir Marmaduke, I ne|ver heard of him before, nor I don't believe
<PB N="339" REF="348">they either. I thought my ma&s;ter Henry would have gone raving di&s;tracted mad, while he was &s;peaking of them, though I found, thank God, he did not know the wor&s;t, which you may be &s;ure, Mrs. Jenny,&mdash;I wi&s;h I might call you Jane, as I find, Sir&mdash;Some|body called you Mrs. Jenny&mdash;I did not, I &s;ay, tell my ma&s;ter the wor&s;t, and &s;o, poor gen|tleman, he got up into his own chamber, that none of the family might &s;ee the trouble he was in&mdash;Ah, Jenny!"&mdash;"I thought you were to call me Jane, Mr. George," &s;ighed &s;he&mdash;"Thank ye, Mrs. Jane," an&s;wered George, bowing; "Ah! dear Mrs. Jane, there is a great deal of trouble that nobody but God Almighty &s;ees&mdash;and Mr. Henry is a great &s;uf|ferer, for all he is &s;o kind &s;poken. 'George,' &s;aid his honour to me, 'is the door fa&s;t?' I went and locked it, trembling all the way, but &s;aying never a word&mdash;'George, if you would &s;ave me from dipping my hands in blood&mdash;in the blood of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart&mdash;take this pur&s;e, and give it to old Denni&s;on, whom you will find at the chapel-hou&s;e, and for your life &s;peak not a word either to
<PB N="340" REF="349">Charles or Caroline.' As he pronounced the&s;e names, I thought his heart would have broke&mdash;'Speak not a &s;yllable to any body, George.' Well, I was at the chapel-hou&s;e, and back almo&s;t directly, and by good luck only &s;aw Mr. Denni&s;on&mdash;though <HI>he</HI> looked almo&s;t as bad as my ma&s;ter. I did not open my lips, but Mr. Denni&s;on whi&s;pered&mdash;he feared it was all over with his young ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>"You a&s;toni&s;h me," &s;aid Jane, "more and more at every word; certainly, unle&s;s Sir Marmaduke's will is good for nothing, by there being one of a later date, the &s;on and daughter of a&mdash;a&mdash;certain per&s;on are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of 500l. a-year each&mdash;for I &s;aw the will with my own eyes, but in the calamities that fell &s;o thick on each other about that time, perhaps, Sir&mdash;Sir&mdash;Gui&s;e forgot the circum&s;tance."</P>
<P>"What circum&s;tance?" demanded George, eagerly.</P>
<P>"Why the will I ju&s;t now &s;poke of; and if it be &s;o, how fortunate &s;hall I think my&s;elf in not having de&s;troyed or lo&s;t it; and you
<PB N="341" REF="350">mu&s;t know, my good George, that while I was living&mdash;alas! I then thought as innocently as happily&mdash;in London, I had occa&s;ion to look into a kind of travelling che&s;t which belonged to Sir Gui&s;e, and which Mr. Valentine Miles's man brought, &s;aying it was full of old papers, it mu&s;t be put into a careful place, as &s;ome of the papers might be of con&s;equence, and were to be &s;orted; and I remember on the after|noon Mr. Dabble the attorney had &s;ettled &s;ome law bu&s;ine&s;s, I ob&s;erved Sir Gui&s;e throw &s;everal packets into that che&s;t, telling me he would have a fire lighted the next time he came, and could &s;pare an hour to overlook and burn mo&s;t of that trumpery; but this was forgotten, and as the baronet was then in a great hurry to go out, the key was forgot al&s;o, which I my&s;elf put into my pocket, with an intention to give it Sir Gui&s;e the next time he came, but it went out of my head, and as the lodgings were &s;canty of drawers and &s;uch conveniencies, I put into it any thing that would otherwi&s;e have laid littering about; in tumbling over the&s;e, I mi&s;placed &s;ome of the papers which Sir Gui&s;e had thrown in for
<PB N="342" REF="351">burning, and was &s;truck with the&s;e words on the back of one of them: 'Copy of Sir Marmaduke's will.' I don't know what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me to look into it, and though I could not very well make it out, I read &s;uf|ficient to &s;ee it was much in favour of the ba|ronet's children."</P>
<P>"But you have got the papers yet, you &s;ay," cried George; "with the ble&s;&s;ing of God we may &s;till recover their property. I have a thought, Mrs. Jane; you mu&s;t be ruled by me."</P>
<P>"If no harm is intended Sir Gui&s;e, who, I am &s;ure, cannot be to blame in this, I con&s;ent, George," exclaimed &s;he.</P>
<P>"I dare not tell my ma&s;ter, Mr. Henry Fitzorton, of this, becau&s;e I know the con&s;e|quence; but you mu&s;t let me mention it to his brother, Mr. Sir John&mdash;" &s;o he u&s;ually call|ed him &s;ince Sir Armine's death; "Mr. Sir John," &s;aid he, "is as firm as a rock, and as &s;tout-hearted as a lion, yet goes quietly about a thing."</P>
<P>"Do any thing you like," &s;aid the agitated girl, "&s;o as you re&s;cue the poor injured
<PB N="343" REF="352">creatures rights, though I fear it is too late; only do not let any harm come to Sir Gui&s;e, who was made to do whatever tho&s;e lawyers thought proper; if any body has been to blame in this affair, it re&s;ts with me in not &s;peaking of it before, which was only from thinking it of no con&s;equence; for I recollect once mentioning it to Sir Gui&s;e, who &s;aid the bu&s;ine&s;s was taken care of, and I dare &s;ay he thought &s;o; not that I pretend to under&s;tand the&s;e matters, nor I &s;uppo&s;e he neither."</P>
<P>"May be &s;o," cried George; "but I know who does as well as any lawyer in the land; &s;o do you go and get the papers ready, dear Mrs. Jane, and leave the re&s;t to me; but not a word to any living &s;oul, and as to harm&mdash;God help us, we only want to do what is right, and would not wrong any body."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>THIS affectionate conduct on the part of George, during the di&s;clo&s;ure of a hi&s;tory
<PB N="344" REF="353">from which reproaches were expected, won extremely on the grateful heart of the timid Jane Atwood, who, on taking leave, recom|pen&s;ed him with a look that richly paid the cordial he had be&s;towed on her wounded &s;pirit; and this was the fir&s;t moment he dared to tell him&s;elf&mdash;I am not indifferent to her.</P>
<P>But the hi&s;tory, and the hi&s;torian, as well as the new &s;en&s;ation which filled his heart, did not allow of his going to &s;leep, or even to bed. The morning beginning to dawn, he waited John's hour of ri&s;ing with the utmo&s;t impatience; at length it came, and as John had pa&s;t the night in fruitle&s;s meditations upon the mode of extorting &s;ome provi&s;ion for poor Charles and his &s;i&s;ter out of the father's daily di&s;&s;ipated finances, it was the cri&s;is mo&s;t favourable to the tidings that the worthy do|me&s;tic had to communicate. To render all things pliant, John, weary with cogitations, adopting an idea this minute and rejecting it the next, had left his chamber at &s;un-ri&s;e and taken a meditative walk round a &s;hrubbery that was fenced in by the park paling on one &s;ide, and by a quick&s;et of hawthorns on the
<PB N="345" REF="354">other, running about a mile circularly from each wing of the hou&s;e.&mdash;George triumphed in this opportunity, and de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to unfold to his honour a &s;cene of villainy as bad as that of Guy Faukes&mdash;&s;eeing it was again&s;t one of the be&s;t young gentlemen and gentle-women in the country, aye in the world&mdash;Captain and Mi&s;s Stuart.</P>
<P>A man, already debating on a &s;ubject which intere&s;ts his affections, eagerly catches at every thing that applies. John&mdash;we &s;hould ere this have marked his right of inheritance by calling him Sir John, but that, in his &s;trong way, he forbid every one of the family to u&s;e any title that reminded them or him of &s;o irreparable a lo&s;s as the death of Sir Armine Fitzorton; and whenever any one annexed to his name the title which that lo&s;s conferred on him, he would check the ob&s;ervance of that mark of re&s;pect with as &s;tern a frown as new-made Honourables generally give to tho&s;e who pre&s;ume to neglect it: But the dignity of John Fitzorton depended on nothing ex|ternal&mdash;He ordered George to follow him into a &s;ummer-hou&s;e at the &s;outh corner of the
<PB N="346" REF="355">&s;hrubbery, where the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>"Relate every circum&s;tance, George."</P>
<P>"Only your honour will take it into con&s;i|deration, that poor Mrs. Jane Atwood, who is the cau&s;e of the plot being di&s;covered, comes to no harm; but indeed your honour will &s;ee &s;he de&s;erves none: and I have pa&s;&s;ed my word, afore God and Mrs. Jane, that &s;hould Sir Gui&s;e Stuart be found to have any hand in the matter, not to 'peach &s;o as to get him hanged, as to be &s;ure he ought to have been long agone."</P>
<P>John nodded a&s;&s;ent. George related all that Jane had told him about the will, &s;aying, at the clo&s;e of his narrative, "I am glad at heart to &s;ee your honour takes it &s;o well. I knew you would not fly out into hurry-&s;curry&mdash;Lord love his honour&mdash;as Mr. Henry would&mdash;but take your mea&s;ures to get back what belongs to poor Captain and Mi&s;s Caroline more coolly and cunningly, an't plea&s;e your honour: and it was therefore, I thought to my&s;elf, &s;ays I, 'George, you had better tell 'Squire Sir John than 'Squire Henry, about
<PB N="347" REF="356">this will.' And as to my Jane&mdash;that is&mdash;our Jane Atwood&mdash;I've done Jennying her, by permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;your honour &s;ees &s;he is as harmle&s;s in the affair as the new-born baby; and per|haps &s;o is Sir Gui&s;e: but if it had not been for Jane, the thing might have been <HI>&s;mu&s;hed</HI> up for ever&mdash;at lea&s;t in this world."</P>
<P>John did not interrupt this &s;tory by a &s;ingle que&s;tion. What George called <HI>taking it &s;o well,</HI> aro&s;e from the magnitude of the emo|tion. At &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the narrative, torrents of blood ru&s;hed into his cheeks, which the next moment were left of as death|like a pale as if there had not been one drop of that blood remaining in his body. He threw open the window, and thru&s;t his head out for air&mdash;a common habit with him in de&s;perate ca&s;es&mdash;and left it open till he was as often obliged to &s;hut it, his teeth chattering and his hands &s;haking, as if the chills of death had come &s;uddenly upon him. At length, col|lecting all his powers of &s;elf-controllment, he conferred an unu&s;ual mark of di&s;tinction on George, whom he &s;hook by the hand&mdash;an honour never before granted to any do|me&s;tic;

<P>Henry, on the other hand, was apt to conde&s;cend a little too much: it produced affection, but it &s;ometimes engendered al&s;o undue familiarity, and relaxed the well-poi&s;ed authority &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;erved invio|late.

<P>There was in John's &s;peech, or in the manner of uttering it, &s;omething &s;o affecting to True George, that he bowed and looked, looked and bowed him&s;elf out of the room. Silent obedience, however, in &s;ervants was ever a charm in the eyes of John.</P>
<P>But Jane Atwood's lover did not &s;uffer even love it&s;elf to delay carrying the bundle of papers &s;he gave him, but &s;till with the injunctions as to Sir Gui&s;e.</P>

<P>NOTHING, &s;urely, but the de&s;ignation of that Providence, which gives to its direc|tion the form of ca&s;ualty, could make the timid and apprehen&s;ive Sir Gui&s;e Stuart either
<PB N="351" REF="360">&s;o negligent or &s;o forgetful, as to leave the credentials of his intended fraud&mdash;for we will ea&s;e the reader &s;o far as to tell him it had not been completely perpetrated&mdash;upon his chil|dren to the mercy of whom&s;oever might find them. But thus it is that the crafty is en|trapped by his own &s;nare; thus, too, is there often to be &s;een, even in this world, in earne&s;t of that which is to come, a ju&s;t di&s;tribution of puni&s;hments and rewards.</P>
<P>From the written te&s;timonies it appeared, that Sir Marmaduke Stuart, a fir&s;t cou&s;in to Sir Gui&s;e, had made a will, though Sir Gui&s;e had given out he died inte&s;tate, in con&s;e|quence of which, Sir Gui&s;e, being heir at law, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his property, which, though not very con&s;iderable, was &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the te&s;tator's debts, and an&s;wer the &s;everal beque&s;ts, among&s;t which were life-annuities to the children of Sir Gui&s;e of five hundred pounds each, to be paid into a cer|tain &s;pecified government fund one twelve-month and a day after his decea&s;e, and the intere&s;t to accumulate until the parties came of age, but both intere&s;t and principal to be
<PB N="352" REF="361">delivered up at their arriving at that period. It was likewi&s;e manife&s;t that this will had been duly executed, but the &s;ignatures were torn off; and Sir Gui&s;e made up his con|&s;cience to the enjoying the fruit of his deceit. But unluckily for the Baronet, Sir Marma|duke's &s;olicitor, who was obliged to go &s;ud|denly and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome property in the We&s;t Indies, where he afterwards e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, &s;ent over to Sir Gui&s;e a &s;econd will, the date of which revoked all others, and in this deci&s;ive one Charles and Caroline were mentioned with no le&s;s marks of di&s;tinction. Before, however, the end of the &s;ame year an account arrived from Jamaica of the attor|ney's death, an event which &s;till promi&s;ed &s;e|cre&s;y to the de&s;igns of Sir Gui&s;e, who, finding his own e&s;tates begin to ebb apace, felt a &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;upply them from Sir Marmaduke's re&s;ervoir. To which end he &s;till gave out to his &s;on and daughter, that they had not been remembered&mdash;he &s;uppo&s;ed becau&s;e Sir Marmaduke knew the property would devolve to them as effectually after their tender father's death as if it had
<PB N="353" REF="362">been devi&s;ed. Charles and Caroline being then very young, and very generous, and, of cour&s;e, very un&s;u&s;pecting, re&s;ted &s;atisfied with this account, and taking its truth for granted, never renewed, or perhaps never thought on the &s;ubject. They had never &s;een Sir Marma|duke, who chiefly lived abroad, and left &s;o large a portion of his fortune to his cou&s;in's children, merely becau&s;e he did not wi&s;h to give it out of the family; and yet did not choo&s;e to bequeath it to Sir Gui&s;e, whom he never e&s;teemed, and to whom he left only fifty pounds, with the&s;e remarkable words:&mdash;"I give and bequeath the &s;um of fifty pounds to my kin&s;man Sir Gui&s;e Stuart in token of my contempt." This mark of ignominy, however, Sir Gui&s;e pocketed, as he did every other affront, even when it was not gilded like the pre&s;ent. Matters remained in this undivulged way, to the infinite content of Sir Gui&s;e, till he di&s;covered that at the time the attorney &s;ent over to him a copy of the will, the original, &s;ent by the &s;ame conveyance, had been depo&s;ited in Doctors' Commons, but which, Sir Gui&s;e was informed, had been
<PB N="354" REF="363">de&s;troyed. This thundering intelligence ar|rived at the time of the Baronet's mature&s;t aver&s;ion to the fir&s;t Lady Stuart, and to Ca|roline, and when his affections to Charles were in the decline. All the&s;e were motives to run any hazards rather than make a con|fe&s;&s;ion of the fact to the parties concerned. But there was yet a more important induce|ment to hu&s;h up the bu&s;ine&s;s. We mu&s;t make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion to &s;tate the nature of it.</P>
<P>The finances of Sir Gui&s;e had even then been &s;ome time under the pupillage of Mrs. Tempe&s;t and her paramour Miles. The Ba|ronet's unconquerable love of the dice, and his complete ignorance with their con&s;um|mate &s;kill, gave them both the be&s;t pretence of plundering him in an honourable way. One fatal evening, therefore, when he was literally &s;tript even from his diamond &s;hirt-buckle to his watch, and downward to his &s;hoe-buckles, at a <HI>friendly</HI> party, compo&s;ed of Mrs. Tem|pe&s;t, Valentine Miles, a common companion of theirs, and him&s;elf, he grew frantic with his ill luck, and, execrating Fortune, re&s;olved on complete redemption or utter ruin at a
<PB N="355" REF="364">&s;troke. Mrs. Tempe&s;t had, in a few hours, won &s;everal thou&s;and pounds; Valentine no le&s;s. The friend abovementioned, whom Mrs. Tempe&s;t called cou&s;in, had &s;ingly net|ted a draft for 8000 l. Claret, Burgundy, Champaigne, and la&s;t of all "imperial To|kay," had been called in to &s;upport the droop|ing heart, aching head, and trembling hand. The di&s;appointed rage of Sir Gui&s;e, till it was put to flight by fear, was always phrenzy without the inflammations of the bottle; but the&s;e being adjoined, raving madne&s;s is a phra&s;e &s;omewhat too temperate to expre&s;s the non-de&s;cript di&s;traction of this memorable hour. He over&s;et the dice-table, threw one of the boxes into the fire, tore and &s;tamped upon &s;ome of the cards, gna&s;hed others be|tween his teeth, piled one chair upon an|other, &s;lapped his forehead, and at length, being worked up to the proper ferment, he leaped upon the table, and propo&s;ed "Double or quits. Damnation! I in&s;i&s;t on re&s;titution or ruin!" The bet was taken, amounting to a &s;um of forty thou&s;and pounds, which had been the aggregate winnings of the friendly
<PB N="356" REF="365">trio during the night. The ignorance and in&s;anity of Sir Gui&s;e had no chance with the dexterity and double dealings of three expert gamblers! He &s;oon ro&s;e, therefore, the above &s;um wor&s;e for that &s;ingle throw, and at one &s;itting became debtor to the three friends in the &s;um of eighty thou&s;and pounds!</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e now declared him&s;elf a ruined man, and muttered &s;omething about packed cards and loaded dice; whereupon Valentine Mills &s;trutted up to him, a&s;&s;uming the man of nice honour, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;atisfaction. The bodily fear of Sir Gui&s;e always brought him to his &s;en&s;es, whether he was deliriou&s;ly intoxicated with wine, or lo&s;&s;es, or in&s;ults. In a tone wholly altered, he declared he had been &s;trangely mi&s;conceived, but it was plaguy hard to have &s;uch a cur&s;ed run in one night. Mrs. Tempe&s;t &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure her dear Baronet meant nothing per&s;onal; the friend prote&s;ted, for his part he thought peo|ple in luck ought to do an hand&s;ome thing to the lo&s;ing party, &s;wearing that he would accept only Sir Gui&s;e's note at his own time for ten thou&s;and, and cry quits. The cue
<PB N="357" REF="366">was no &s;ooner given, than the other perform|ers acted their parts to perfection. Miles a&s;&s;everated that he had as great a regard for Sir Gui&s;e as for any man in the world, and would let him off ea&s;ily, and "I will an&s;wer for the lady's liberality." "Aye, he knows my weak part too well," &s;ighed Mrs. Tempe&s;t. "Do what you will with me, gentlemen," an&s;wered the Baronet: "If you think fit to &s;ave me from ruin, it is more than I de&s;erve." Thus they parted, and the next day Sir Gui&s;e being wholly out of ca&s;h, as the trio very well knew, a mortgage was given on the abbey e&s;tate for ten thou&s;and pound to the friend, and the foundation was laid for the approbation and &s;ale of poor Charles and Caroline's annuities to &s;atisfy the two other moderate claims of Mrs. Tempe&s;t and her Valentine.</P>
<P>Ver&s;atile to the numberle&s;s meanders of the town, Mr. Miles &s;oon adju&s;ted the &s;ale of the property in Mr. Dabble, the man in the world to make or mar a thou&s;and la&s;t wills and te&s;taments. The &s;ub&s;equent curious epi&s;tle which fell into John's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion will

<P>At the fini&s;hing of this eloquent mor&s;el, which was among&s;t the papers delivered by Jane Atwood, John worked the letter into a twi&s;t in his clenched hand, preci&s;ely as he would have twi&s;ted the neck of the writer had he been pre&s;ent; and then, per&s;onifying the innocent paper, be&s;towed upon it all tho&s;e opprobrious names which were due to Mr. Nicholas Dabble, but of which the &s;aid pa|per was to the full as &s;en&s;ible in point of con&s;cience as the afore&s;aid Nicholas, who had lived in the city of London a practi&s;ing doer of all dirty works eight and thirty-years, with|out once committing an action, even by mi&s;|take, which did not de&s;erve the halter. He had been the bo&s;om friend of Mr. Miles and Mrs. Tempe&s;t half their lives, during which time he had got both of them out of as many hang-worthy e&s;capes as he had got every per&s;on they connected with into them. And, indeed, few Judges had ordered more guilty per&s;ons from the pri&s;on to the gallows than Nicholas had prepared innocent ones for
<PB N="360" REF="369">both. But, as Mr. Dabble will turn out by no means like one of tho&s;e heroes who "&s;trut their hour upon the &s;tage, and then are heard no more," we will re&s;erve what may further be proper to &s;ay of him to his &s;econd ap|pearance, convinced that his fir&s;t has fixed an impre&s;&s;ion of his character in the mind of the reader not &s;peedily to be effaced.</P>
<P>John &s;oon recollecting him&s;elf, deemed the epi&s;tolary philippic of this pro&s;titutor of the law of too high value to de&s;troy, and therefore re&s;cued it, almo&s;t griped a&s;under, to as nearly its pri&s;tine &s;tate as he could, in the con&s;olatory hope, that, like the hand|writing on the wall, it might, one day, be given in evidence again&s;t the author. Meanwhile, he carefully folded it up, and having &s;at a full hour in the profound thought that u&s;ually preceded his deeds of moment, he ro&s;e from his chair indignant and deter|mined. His plan was mature, and he lo&s;t not an in&s;tant in its execution.</P>

<P>BY a per&s;everance which unea&s;ine&s;s of mind rather rendered more inten&s;e than ob&s;tructed, John had by this time &s;ecured his &s;eat in parliament, where the independent di&s;play of his talents and principles had gain|ed him the re&s;pect of all parties; as his at|tention to military duty, at home and abroad, had rendered him honourable in the opinion of friends and enemies: but, in the intervals of peace, it was always a lucky circum&s;tance to favour any of John's &s;ecret manoeuvres, or in retreating from any chagrin or bo&s;om &s;er|vice at the ca&s;tle, to gain the regiment; and whenever the colonel, the colonel's hor&s;e, or groom were not to be found, which was often the ca&s;e, it was concluded he was gone to quarters: And when his own &s;ervant was indi&s;po&s;ed, he would, without ceremony, borrow True George from Henry, for an hour, a day, or a week. For in&s;tance, the colonel's &s;ervants being otherwi&s;e employed,
<PB N="362" REF="371">or thought le&s;s proper for the bu&s;ine&s;s, George was now ordered to have hor&s;es &s;addled at five the next morning. The colonel only &s;aying to him over-night, "You mu&s;t leave your ma&s;ter, aye, and your mi&s;|tre&s;s too, George, to accompany me at five to-morrow, on the matter we &s;poke about in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e." George bounded, rather than ran, out of the room, and on that oc|ca&s;ion would have left even the arms of his Jane, had they been enfolding him in the bridal hour,
<Q>Punctual as lovers to the moment &s;worn.</Q>
therefore John Fitzorton and True George kept their a&s;&s;ignation in the &s;table. The morning was heavy with clouds, which, as the colonel mounted his &s;teed, broke in deluges of rain: Neither of our heroes appeared at all di&s;|po&s;ed to advert to the circum&s;tance, nor in|deed to be &s;en&s;ible of it. The 'tempe&s;t in their minds,' as the great dramatic delineator &s;ays, 'took from them all feeling el&s;e.' They had cleared the park, and got about a mile on the road, when George recollected that
<PB N="363" REF="372">the Colonel's great coat was belted to his back; and the Colonel, &s;o far from feeling the want of it, was jogging on at a gentle trot, with his eyes fixed on the pummel of the &s;addle, as if he were counting the drops that fell from the &s;pout of his hat, which, having the cock military, filled like a re&s;ervoir, and, from the down|ward bend of his head, flowed like a fountain.</P>
<P>George, however, having unbuckled the great coat, rode up to the &s;ide of John Fitz|orton, but &s;eeing his po&s;ition, (for George critically under&s;tood all the family attitudes,) he feared to interrupt his mind by an un&s;ea&s;onable care of his body, which, he knew, was always &s;econdary in Colonel Sir John's cogibundu&s;&s;es. After due delibera|tion, therefore, what, in &s;o difficult a ca&s;e, was proper to be done, he pa&s;&s;ed by John a &s;ew paces, holding the great coat at arm's length, &s;o that it might &s;trike in the mo&s;t favourable point of view, and thereby re|commend it&s;elf; but this not &s;ucceeding, and the &s;hower not only increa&s;ing, but driving with the wind full in their faces, George drew in his own &s;teed, and gently
<PB N="364" REF="373">threw the coat on John's &s;houlders. This arou&s;ing the latter, who had been all that time making Sir Gui&s;e, his new married lady, her gallant Mr. Miles, their agent Mr. Nick Dabble, and even the purcha&s;er of annuities, dance the tight rope from one &s;caffold, had the de&s;ired effect; the colonel, throwing the bridle on his hor&s;e's neck, took up the great coat, and put it on &s;lightly, &s;ay|ing to George, who &s;tood at the hor&s;e's head, "And I advi&s;e you to follow the ex|ample;" which the obedient George would certainly have taken even had the dog&s;tar raged&mdash;&s;o implicit was he as to the word of command&mdash;but for a trifling impediment&mdash;that is to &s;ay, he had no great coat to put on; for when he unbuckled John's, he for|got to &s;ave his own, which, therefore, dropt for the u&s;e of the next traveller who might wi&s;h for &s;uch a convenience. Upon this di&s;covery, however, George contented his hone&s;t heart with gently condemning and &s;triking his own head, kept his &s;tation behind, and only &s;aid to him&s;elf, 'What a &s;illy Simon! 'tis well it was not Mr. Sir John's, though.'</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="374">The Colonel pu&s;hed on, much increa&s;ing his pace&mdash;not becau&s;e the morning continued &s;howery, but becau&s;e he had, perhaps, &s;a|tisfied his imagination with &s;eeing the parties &s;wing their hour in his fancy, and he &s;eemed riding-po&s;t to take the news to his friends. The Colonel and his attendant had travelled up|wards of twenty-four miles ere George had hazarded a conjecture where they might be going, for John had not &s;aid a &s;yllable as to that particular, nor, indeed, would George have made an inquiry had he been journey|ing to the world's end; but that feeling a mi&s;giving they were wrong, he &s;uppo&s;ed matters had better be &s;et right; he conceived John was at lea&s;t two-and-twenty miles out of the road. He was therefore on the very rim of a que&s;tion, the rare&s;t of all things with George, when John, pulling in his &s;teed, &s;ignified his intention to &s;top at the next market-town, and if the weather did not clear, go po&s;t the re&s;t of the way, "for," add|ed he, "I am, as I &s;uppo&s;e you may gue&s;s, going to Mr. Partington's."&mdash;"Ble&s;s us! your
<PB N="366" REF="375">honour," replied George, "I wi&s;h I had known that before, becau&s;e I could have gone &s;everal miles nearer acro&s;s the country. We &s;hould have left the London road, which your honour knows we are &s;till upon, at the two mile-&s;tone, and gone over the heaths." "And pray how happens it thou art &s;o well ac|quainted with this road?" interrogated John, "'tis quite out of Henry's beat, pro&s;aic or poetical, and Partington is but recently &s;ettled in the&s;e parts."&mdash;"Your honour knows I have been backwards and forwards on one bu&s;ine&s;s or t'other ever &s;ince&mdash;"&mdash;"Ever &s;ince&mdash;Jenny Atwood's father, I &s;uppo&s;e, was put by Partington into a farm in his neighbourhood. Hey George? What, you went for his vote and intere&s;t I &s;uppo&s;e?" George blu&s;hed, and took in a copious mouthful of rain; he then &s;aid, "We mu&s;t now go right an end, plea&s;e your honour, then take the road &s;lip-&s;ide of the town, which will bring us to&mdash;to the farmer's, your honour." While George was accurately de&s;cribing the geography of the road to Partington's, a man on hor&s;eback rode by at a full trot, when George immediately
<PB N="367" REF="376">exclaimed&mdash;"Your honour, there's my great coat! if your honour will give me leave, I'll have it off that fellow's back in <HI>a jiffy.</HI>"&mdash;John a&s;&s;enting to this, the dripping George gallopped after the man, who, believing him&s;elf pur&s;ued, and who&s;e hor&s;e having the &s;peed of George's, would, perhaps, have e&s;cap|ed with the &s;urtout after all, had not &s;ome little altercation at the turnpike taken place, and occa&s;ioned a delay which brought the pur&s;uer near enough to catch the arm of the man pur&s;ued, and to &s;ay&mdash;"This is mine, Sir; I'll make affidavy of it before a ju&s;tice of peace; and there's one ju&s;t behind, who is a'&s;quire, and a barrow night, and a colonel, and a parliament-man, at the &s;ame time, and who knows the coat as well as I do." The word ju&s;tice, &s;ounded more ominou&s;ly in the ears of the party accu&s;ed than all the other titles of his wor&s;hip, had they out-pedigreed Cadwallader; he therefore owned the fact, &s;aying, "Though I found it in the king's highway, friend, and could, therefore, keep it by law, I will &s;urrender it, if the pikeman will open the gate and let me through, as I am
<PB N="368" REF="377">in a very great hurry." This ha&s;te produced a &s;u&s;picion in the mind of the toll-receiver, who &s;wore he would detain him as a thief on his own confe&s;&s;ion, the goods being found upon him. "And as to your finding a good great coat on the road &s;uch a morning as this," &s;aid the man, &s;neeringly, "'tis a likely &s;tory, indeed! &s;eeing that there is not &s;uch a ninny in the world to throw away the be&s;t friend to a man's back in &s;uch a ducibus of a day as here is!" For the proof of which a&s;|&s;ertion he appealed to George him&s;elf, putting it to <HI>him,</HI> whether &s;uch a nincompoop igno|ramus was ever known in King George's dominions! He then added, "I &s;uppo&s;e, young man, this fellow has robbed both you and your ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"I believe," &s;aid George, "he <HI>might</HI> find it, for I was fool enough to let it drop; but &s;till it is my coat, and I mu&s;t have it." All this time the &s;tranger re&s;i&s;ted, for fear of &s;ome wor&s;e di&s;|covery; and while he was labouring to muffle up his face in the &s;aid coat, which had now become nece&s;&s;ary as a di&s;gui&s;e, George laboured to un|ca&s;e him, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the tollman, and indeed by

At the &s;ight of John Fitzorton his u&s;ual pre&s;ence of mind, which in a ca&s;e of &s;tratagem was &s;carcely inferior to that of the Swedi&s;h monarch, wholly for&s;ook him, and he fell upon his knees, a&s;&s;uring every one pre&s;ent, that&mdash;though he knew he was a very infamous ra&s;cal, greater ra&s;cals than he had made him &s;o; and particularly the love of gold, the root of all evil, and which he verily thought was the greate&s;t ra&s;cal-maker in the world, and would, &s;ooner or later, bring him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a number of his friends to the gallows. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t indeed, your honour, my con&s;cience has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> done what I thought would never come to pa&s;s, worked a miracle upon me, for I am

<P>John could &s;carcely help unbending his mu&s;cles, braced up as they had long been to thoughts of vengeance; and, indeed, he al|mo&s;t &s;miled at the place which Otley had cho&s;en for the &s;cene of his reformation. How|ever, commanding George to take his pro|perty, the youth had no &s;ooner obeyed, than feeling &s;omething hard and heavy in the poc|kets, he took out from thence a brace of pi&s;|tols, which in an in&s;tant George di&s;covered to be loaded.</P>
<P>"As <HI>our</HI> pi&s;tols, your honour, are in their ca&s;es on the &s;addles, the&s;e cannot be they," &s;aid George, &s;ignificantly.</P>
<P>"And are the&s;e the books, &s;irrah, from which you &s;tudy the art of penitence?" que&s;|tioned the Colonel, &s;ternly. "Tie him on the hor&s;e, George, and bring him away."&mdash;Jane's lover performed this with &s;urpri&s;ing agility.

<PB N="371" REF="380">before him, trotted off with him calf-fa&s;hion, with as much ea&s;e as if he had been carrying his ma&s;ter's portmanteau.</P>
<P>The turnpike-man, who was an arch fel|low, and a great lover of &s;eeing thieves taken, tried, and executed, begged a holiday of his wife.&mdash;"Now do oblige me, my dear love, by letting one of your pretty eyes look to the gate, and your two pretty hands take the toll, ju&s;t while I &s;ee this gentleman limbo'd. 'Tis for the good of my country to lend a lift to hang off its rogues; and next to you I love my country, you know."&mdash;The wife, plea&s;ed with the wording of her hu&s;band's petition, charitably and lovingly replied, "Well&mdash;but mind you bring me back news the fellow is to be hanged at our next &s;i&s;es, becau&s;e then I &s;hall have a go&s;&s;iping as well as you, and limping Beck will &s;ee to the gate; and I <HI>know,</HI> hu&s;band, that is a villain, becau&s;e the young man &s;ays he went from 'Squire Clare's family to that of &s;ir Gui&s;e.

<P>Thus authori&s;ed, the turnpike-man, jump|ing up behind George, reached his colonel
<PB N="372" REF="381">and the town, which was but a &s;hort mile from the turnpike, at the &s;ame time. They &s;topt at the &s;ign which bore the name of George, with the addition of Saint, for the prowe&s;s of conquering the dragon; but per|haps the reader will pre&s;ently be of opinion, as great honours ought to be adjudged to our modern George for his atchievements in bring|ing to condign puni&s;hment an animal more baneful to &s;ociety than the dragon which fable a&s;&s;erts, or all the actual wild bea&s;ts of the earth; for what troop of them can cau&s;e half the mi&s;chief that has often been produced by one di&s;hone&s;t man?</P>
<P>The culprit being unbound, to ob&s;erve which a greater concour&s;e of &s;pectators had gathered, than &s;uited the colonel's purpo&s;e, he took in his hand Otley's pi&s;tols, and went with him into a room, and &s;at on him in his judicial capacity, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or, by right of elder&s;hip, as well as nomination in the commi&s;|&s;ion of the peace. A&s;&s;uming, therefore, his terrible graces, he told David, in a very &s;uc|cinct manner, that he was appri&s;ed of enough of <HI>his</HI> villany, as well as that of his employers,
<PB N="373" REF="382">to hang the whole gang. "But as you know me, Otley," &s;aid John, "few words are nece&s;|&s;ary; an&s;wer, then, the que&s;tions I &s;hall put to you;&mdash;fir&s;t, whither are you going?"&mdash;"To London, &s;ir, as I hope to be &s;pared," an|&s;wered the trembler.&mdash;"To London! for what?"&mdash;"To&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;"&mdash;"Have a care! if your affectation of penitence was not in it|&s;elf an ample ground of my &s;u&s;picion, the thorough knowledge of you and your a&s;&s;o|ciates warrants my in&s;i&s;ting upon&mdash;." "Sir, your honour, I &s;ee, knows me as well as I know my&s;elf," interrupted the quivering wretch; "I am only going, &s;ir&mdash;am going, a going&mdash;I am going, an't plea&s;e your ho|nour&mdash;I am only going&mdash;" "Where, ra&s;|cal?"&mdash;"To town, on a little bu&s;ine&s;s to Sir Gui&s;e and Mr. Miles's attorney, &s;ir."&mdash;"His attorney!" exclaimed John, &s;taring wildly. "What is that attorney's name, &s;irrah?&mdash;"His name, an't plea&s;e your honour&mdash;his name is&mdash;that is to &s;ay the name he does bu|&s;ine&s;s in, is&mdash;is&mdash;" "Is what, abominable caitiff," que&s;tioned the terrible John, lo&s;ing all temper. "The name he does <HI>&s;ome</HI> of
<PB N="374" REF="383">his bu&s;ine&s;&s;es in, plea&s;e your hon&mdash;hon&mdash;hon&mdash;hon&mdash;our," replied Otley, cutting the word exactly in twain between his chattering teeth, "is N.

Lord! your honour! &s;ave me, I am but a &s;ervant; a &s;econd-handed little per&s;onage, as it were, and obliged to do as I am bid. But I &s;ee your honour knows all; yes, I &s;ee I &s;hall &s;uffer yet. I told my|&s;elf &s;o years agone! both at the manor-hou&s;e and ca&s;tle. David, (&s;aid I,) depend upon it, my friend, the abbey will, &s;ooner or later, take you to Tyburn."</P>
<P>"The abbey, for once, told truth," &s;aid John.</P>
<P>Here David dropped on his knees implor|ing mercy, and prote&s;ting he would from that moment be an hone&s;t man, and give in&s;tant proof of it, by 'peaching his ma&s;ter, mi&s;tre&s;s, and Miles, and the lawyer, and his clerk; and,
<PB N="375" REF="384">in &s;hort, bring all their necks into the noo&s;e, if his wor&s;hip would but promi&s;e to let his own &s;lip out of it.</P>
<P>John, in&s;tead of making any promi&s;e, held one of the pi&s;tols to each ear of the mi&s;erable petitioner, till he confe&s;&s;ed that he was going to Mr. Dabble's chambers to meet the fa|mily.</P>
<P>"What family?" interpo&s;ed John.</P>
<P>"Sir Gui&s;e, and the new Lady Stuart, and Mr. Miles, your honour, will be there pre|&s;ently, having &s;et off before day-light from the abbey; only they come into the open road by back ways, and are going to &s;ettle &s;ome little affair with a gentleman who lives in this very place, and then for London, to Mr. Dabble's and&mdash;and there has been a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</P>
<P>"WHAT?" &s;aid John, in thundering ac|cents. "A little bit of a <HI>rumbu&s;tion</HI> at the abbey, and Mr. Dabble is to commodate.&mdash;He's a va&s;t commodater, your wor&s;hip&mdash;and I am a party&mdash;&s;omething about a little bit of an affair of honour between Mr. Miles and my lady.&mdash;And this&mdash;this&mdash;is the whole
<PB N="376" REF="385">truth, as we are all wicked &s;inners, an plea&s;e your wor&s;hipful, merciful honour."</P>
<P>What further que&s;tions John would have put to the captive is uncertain; for True George tapped at the door of the chamber of examination, and, &s;peaking through the key|hole, &s;aid, "the mob was &s;o great, they would not leave the inn-yard till they knew what was to be done with the rogue." John, by the &s;ame mode of communication, de&s;ired them to be told, that the man had given &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to all his que&s;tions; and that, as the great coat had been actually found, and re&s;tored, the pri&s;oner mu&s;t be acquitted, in ca&s;e he cleared up &s;ome other points, for which he mu&s;t proceed with him to London. The multitude, though they appeared much di&s;contented with the&s;e tidings, di&s;per&s;ed, le&s;t they them&s;elves &s;hould become re&s;pon&s;ible to ju&s;tice. The turnpike-man, in particular, was mortified, and began to fear it was de|creed for him to return home to his wife without his welcome, having pledged him&s;elf, at parting, to bring the good news &s;he ex|pected, as to the thief's being committed to
<PB N="377" REF="386">pri&s;on, and in a fair way of the gallows. And, indeed, &s;everal of the mob now &s;hifted their cen&s;ure from the thief to the ju&s;tice, whom, in a general muttering, they accu&s;ed of undue &s;everity, in taking a poor hone&s;t man up, and packing him upon a hor&s;e, as if he was a bea&s;t. Nay, one of the bye-&s;tanders ob|&s;erved, "that ju&s;tices of the peace ought to be <HI>&s;ure</HI> what they are about, before they go &s;uch lengths; otherwi&s;e, nobody is &s;afe," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e neare&s;t to him; "and you or I may be clapt into pri&s;on when we are as innocent as the child unborn; and as to the coat's being dropt&mdash;I don't doubt but that was de&s;igned as a trick upon travellers, all done for the purpo&s;e. I have been in the law my&s;elf, and wi&s;h every gentleman of the faculty"&mdash;"You mean, of the profe&s;&s;ion, per|haps," &s;aid his next-hand neighbour. "Well," re&s;umed the other, "it is the &s;ame thing, faculty or profe&s;&s;ion, in the Greek; and I &s;ay again, what I meant to &s;ay before&mdash;I wi&s;h all gentlemen were of my opinion; then &s;ome|body would be ducked, or &s;o, for trying to <HI>make</HI> rogues of hone&s;t men&mdash;ju&s;tice or no
<PB N="378" REF="387">ju&s;tice." George, who, though in regard to his own intere&s;ts, he was the mo&s;t peaceable young fellow in the world, had a &s;pirit of vindictive fire that mounted into flame the moment any of his ma&s;ter's friends or favour|ites were accu&s;ed. Having heard, therefore, the&s;e reflections on ju&s;tice, he caught hold of the profe&s;&s;ional gentleman of the faculty, &s;wearing, that his ma&s;ter was the be&s;t ju&s;tice in all the country, as well as one of the be&s;t men in all the world; and if every man had his de&s;erts, he did not doubt but the ra&s;cal that dared to &s;ay any thing to the contrary ought to &s;wing under the gallows. "My ma&s;ter's name, the ju&s;tice of peace now in that room," cried George aloud, and with triumph, "is Co|lonel Mr. Sir John Fitzorton, who is the &s;on of Sir Armine Fitzorton; and &s;hall &s;uch a fellow as this here, that I am &s;haking by the collar, and who, I dare &s;ay, is no more a lawyer than I am&mdash;&s;hall the &s;on, I &s;ay, of Sir Armine"&mdash;&s;everal of the populace, to whom the name of Sir Armine was not only known, but held in reverence, would not permit George to fini&s;h what he intended to &s;ay; but, levelling their
<PB N="379" REF="388">re&s;entment at its proper mark, they took the accu&s;er of ju&s;tice from the gra&s;p of George into their own hands, and were proceeding with him to a copious pond at the bottom of the inn back-yard, when a female voice exclaimed, "Stop, &s;top thief!&mdash;there's my handkerchief &s;ticking out of the corner of that man's pocket&mdash;give it me, gentlemen&mdash;I'll &s;wear to my property!" This exclamation produced a &s;earch; the con&s;equence of which was, a redemption, not only of the handker|chief in que&s;tion, but of &s;everal others, all of which were owned by different claimants; among&s;t whom was George him&s;elf, who &s;aid he would &s;wear to a &s;ilk India handker|chief which the thief had thru&s;t into his bo&s;om. "'Tis marked in the corner," exclaimed George, vehemently, "with J. A. and I would not take all the handkerchiefs that ever was born for it." Indeed, it was that which Jane Atwood had, with her own fair hand, tied round his neck the very morning before he &s;et out on the pre&s;ent expedition: in our ha&s;te to prepare for which, we forgot to tell the reader, this affectionate
<PB N="380" REF="389">girl had ri&s;en, notwith&s;tanding the un&s;ea&s;on|ablene&s;s of the hour, to make George, for whom her regard grew apace, a comforting di&s;h of tea, before he went into the cold air.</P>
<P>The worthy gentleman, who&s;e morality, touching the &s;ubject of ju&s;tice, had been &s;o violent, turned out a pickpocket, and, as the reader will perhaps, hereafter, be of opinion, &s;omething wor&s;e. Thus there was fre&s;h bu&s;i|ne&s;s for Ju&s;tice John, before whom, in&s;tead of the hor&s;epond, it was thought expedient to &s;ecure the arraigner of ra&s;h ju&s;tices of the peace, with all his credentials of moral &s;enti|ment about him, &s;ave and except that precious mark of Jane's attachment, which George declared he would &s;hew to the ju&s;tice <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> but that he would not let it be polluted by touching &s;uch a fellow's neck.</P>

<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE clamour in the yard had induced John to open the door, fir&s;t commanding the &s;till-trembling Otley, on pain of death, neither
<PB N="381" REF="390">to &s;peak or &s;tir. In le&s;s than two minutes the room of ju&s;tice was filled with people of all de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The two pri&s;oners, that is to &s;ay, Mr. David Otley and the pickpocket morali&s;t, no &s;ooner &s;aw each other, than, in de&s;pite of the penitence of the one, and the morality of the other, an involuntary recognition took place, in a very curious way&mdash;to wit, in a determina|tion not to own each other; but the &s;truggle, on either &s;ide, to effect the concealment, pro|duced the di&s;covery: a di&s;covery, dear reader, of their being not only brothers in iniquity, according to the vulgar but expre&s;&s;ive phra&s;e, but brothers in blood. It is a nice point in feeling, and certainly a de&s;perate ca&s;e in politics, when two &s;uch per&s;onages are, by a &s;udden and unthought-of rencontre, &s;o tho|roughly a&s;hamed of their relation&s;hip, that each deeming the other the greater &s;coundrel, both re&s;olve on di&s;avowal. Nature, how|ever, &s;ometimes &s;eizes upon men unawares, to the total overthrow of their be&s;t-concerted de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="391">Now the di&s;covery of brotherhood in the ca&s;e of the Otleys, was a &s;troke of that ab&s;o|lute nature treated of by John him&s;elf in one of the Fitzorton conver&s;ations, and of Nature too, in one of her mo&s;t determined moments to prove nearne&s;s of kin. After John had heard the depo&s;itions of &s;everal of the witne&s;&s;es, with George's account of the theft of Jane Atwood's handkerchief, about which George &s;till &s;tormed like another Othello, the ju&s;tice was &s;truck with &s;omething very particular in the behaviour of his two criminals, who, hap|pening to &s;tand parallel to each other, were biting their lips, gna&s;hing their teeth, and making many other grimaces, which they &s;uppo&s;ed were not noticed; for, hitherto, the noi&s;e and confu&s;ion of relating the thefts, and of a&s;&s;erting claim to the &s;everal properties, were favourable to &s;uch deportment. At length, being "perplexed in the extreme," by this demon&s;tration of vengeance in dumb &s;hew, the morali&s;t, exa&s;perated, probably by &s;ome ge&s;ture in the penitent too provoking to be borne, broke through the laws of pan|tomime, by exclaiming&mdash;"What, brother
<PB N="383" REF="392">Davy! you &s;coundrel, are you unhanged yet?" Yes, brother Gam," an&s;wered the pe|nitent, with an overflow of malicious &s;pleen, that forgot all con&s;equences&mdash;"Yes, brother Gam, you villain, I know my duty, and &s;taid on purpo&s;e to &s;ee my elder brother &s;wing fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"Scoundrels!" interpo&s;ed John; "I make no doubt, however, the precedency may be adju&s;ted, but you will both die the &s;ame ho|nourable death; my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent is to direct you the neare&s;t way to the accompli&s;h|ment of your fraternal wi&s;hes&mdash;for which purpo&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>While John was &s;peaking, a noi&s;e was heard at the door, of "Make way, make way for Ju&s;tice Barhim," and in the next minute the &s;aid ju&s;tice, and his attendant, having by dint of fi&s;t and elbows made an avenue through the &s;pectators, his egregious wor&s;hip appeared in view, di&s;covering thus his great abilities and good manners: "Mr. Thingum&mdash;Thang|um&mdash;" &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to John Fitzorton&mdash;"I under&s;tand you have taken upon you to examine, to harbour, and detain
<PB N="384" REF="393">in durance, my thief, thieves, or what not&mdash;the which is neither law, nor go&s;pel, nor like one gentleman to another; thief taken on my juri&s;diction, is as much my thief, as game taken on my manor is my game. Perhaps, Mr. Thingum, you don't know any more who I am than I know or cares who be you; but I mu&s;t tell you, if you be a ju&s;tice, this here town&s;hip has rights; and I, thereby, take up, whip, &s;tock, pound, pillar, cage, bind over, or bind down, or what not, in my own right, &s;o that whoever takes up, whips, &s;tocks, pounds, pillars, cages, &amp;c. &amp;c. in my bounds, commits a tre&s;pa&s;s on my rights, and is thereby guilty of a breach, and an action will &s;tand, go, and lie, again&s;t him. You will do well, therefore, to &s;urrender my thief, thieves, or what not, and look after your own, for there's enow in rea&s;on in every man's pa|ri&s;h, if a gentleman will look after 'um; therefore&mdash;which are the pri&s;oners? what are their offences? and where be they going?"</P>
<P>He now vaulted into the &s;eat of ju&s;tice, &s;quatting down on a chair by the &s;ide of ju&s;tice John, when there pa&s;t a &s;cene of dumb
<PB N="385" REF="394">eloquence betwixt John Fitzorton and his brother of the quorum, not inferior to that which had been acted by the morali&s;t and penitent; for nowith&s;tanding his pretended ignorance, as to per&s;onal identity, the ob|truding magi&s;trate as thoroughly knew John, as John knew him, and they bore to each other an aver&s;ion not le&s;s inveterate than that born by the brother pri&s;oners, though very different in kind; for John Fitzorton de&s;|pi&s;ed Mr. Barhim, becau&s;e he con&s;idered him abundantly more mi&s;chievous than either of the &s;coundrels in cu&s;tody; and Barhim hated John, becau&s;e he was con&s;cious the &s;aid con|tempt was founded on &s;uch knowledge; in &s;hort, the antipathy on either &s;ide was no more than that which an hone&s;t man feels to|wards a rogue, and a rogue towards an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>The mob had now fre&s;h objects of &s;ur|pri&s;e and curio&s;ity before them; John Fitz|orton declared he by no means wi&s;hed to di&s;|pute with Barhim his natural or inherent right to any or to all the vagabonds and villains of the land, ina&s;much as he believed no man had
<PB N="386" REF="395">&s;o ju&s;t a claim on the villain who had a fel|low feeling in the villainy; and that &s;o far from di&s;puting preten&s;ions with Mr. Barhim to a property in the pri&s;oners now before him, that he thought it a pity two jails &s;hould part them; for which rea&s;on, unle&s;s a certain mi&s;demeanor be atoned for, committed &s;ome years &s;ince by the &s;aid Barhim on the per&s;on of the late Sir Armine Fitzorton&mdash;"<HI>my</HI> father, Sir," &s;aid John, exalting his voice, "I &s;hall include three of the greate&s;t &s;coun|drels that ever came before a magi&s;trate to the &s;ame place of confinement."</P>
<P>Before the great man accu&s;ed had opportu|nity to make any reply to this in&s;inuation, which, indeed, it is more than probable he would not have attempted, for it had a vi&s;ible effect upon him, a chariot and four, followed by two &s;ervants, drove into the inn-yard, and the words&mdash;"This way, my lady, this way, an't plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip&mdash;the ju&s;tices and a couple of thieves are in the Angel&mdash;hope your lady&s;hip and his honour, therefore, will put up with the Devil for a moment till they are gone."&mdash;"Thieves," exclaimed
<PB N="387" REF="396">the lady, "I am glad they are taken; we might have been robbed perhaps."&mdash;"I hate pettyfogging, way-laying thieves of all things; I have a great fancy to &s;ee the fellows," ob&s;erved one of the two gentlemen who came out of the coach; "and &s;o have I," &s;aid the other. "Let us go into the room then," &s;aid the lady: "but pray," added &s;he, "has not &s;ome gentleman been here to a&s;k for&mdash;though of cour&s;e <HI>he</HI> is one of the ju&s;tices, &s;o lead on to the thieves."</P>
<P>The reader who has been, in &s;ome &s;ort, pre|pared for the company of Sir Gui&s;e, Lady Tempe&s;t Stuart, and Mr. Valentine, by their courier, Mr. David Otley the penitent, will not be &s;urpri&s;ed by any means in the degree that the &s;aid good company were, when, on entering the apartment of equity, they beheld their own confidential &s;ervant in one of the pri&s;oners&mdash;his brother, who had been of no le&s;s u&s;e in their affairs, in the other, and the two magi&s;trates&mdash;equally known to them&mdash;John Fitzorton, the avowed and indignant enemy of their vices, and Mr. Barhim, as their mercenary and time-&s;erving friend.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="397">But great as was the my&s;tery and amaze|ment in which the mi&s;cellaneous groupe now gathered together in the room of ju&s;tice were involved, de&s;tiny, fortune, or &s;ome &s;uperior power that controls the&s;e, had pre-ordained to thicken the plot, by making it impo&s;&s;ible for any of the parties to go into explanation; and though the reader &s;hould wonder "how the devil the &s;aid parties came there," we are our&s;elves at this moment &s;o full of bu&s;ine&s;s, that he mu&s;t wait for elucidation to a more convenient &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Another arrival this in&s;tant demands our attention, even as it did, at the time it hap|pened, that of the landlord and landlady of the inn, and every &s;ervant who had, from time to time, run to the door of the Angel, then taken a mouthful of ju&s;tice between one &s;ummons and another; crying, "coming, coming, Gemmin," as the different bells rang, then from the Angel to the Devil, from the Star to the Bear, and from the Red Lion to the Fox.

<P>The &s;tage coachman, however, happened to have as great a thir&s;t for glory as the po&s;tillions, and giving his hor&s;es the encou|raging word and the commanding whip, had almo&s;t gained the entrance, when the po&s;til|lions taking each a &s;ide, made a vigorous pu&s;h which carried them all three into the mouth of the gateway at the &s;ame moment, by which manoeuvre all the wheels were locked together, and the axle-trees of the carriage &s;o wedged that they could have but one movement, even as if they had been one body. Seeing which, the high blooded drivers, by this time, like all great &s;ouls, in the heart of action, &s;uperior to con&s;equences,
<PB N="390" REF="399">plied the la&s;h when they ought to have pulled the reins, and by driving forward when they &s;hould have backed, the heavier body, namely the &s;tage coach, di&s;engaged it&s;elf from the lighter one, and carrying all, before it worked its victorious way into the yard, where it broke down with one grand jump upon the &s;tones, almo&s;t &s;hivering its two petty rivals in its fall!</P>
<P>The &s;cream of the pa&s;&s;engers, who were to&s;&s;ed or tumbled out in heaps from all the vehicles, were drowned in the louder cries of the &s;pectators within and without the gate|way; but even the&s;e ejaculations were lo&s;t in the di&s;&s;onant tones and trembling oaths of the &s;tage coachman and the two po&s;tillions, who with no le&s;s than four men, who were jerked from the top of the coach, and as many of the in&s;ide pa&s;&s;engers as could reco|ver their fall and con&s;ternation, were all in arms at one and the &s;ame moment. The ju&s;tice room was emptied even fa&s;ter than it had filled, and the inhabitants of the Angel would have run to the Devil, had not one of the combatants, who appeared, by a handful
<PB N="391" REF="400">of hair which he held in triumph, to have been the mo&s;t active in the affray, cried out, in as loud a voice as a mouth filling with the blood of his own no&s;e would permit&mdash;"Stop, &s;top thief&mdash;&s;top the worthy gentleman to whom this head of hair belongs." Without uttering more, the exclaimer darted among&s;t the croud in &s;earch of the fugitive. Alarmed at this, John Fitzorton and True George, &s;uppo&s;ing the thief who had &s;tolen away was one of their own pri&s;oners, looked about and &s;aw both of them &s;ecured, the one in the cu&s;tody of a &s;tout young man, which hap|pened to be Jonathan Arm&s;trong, Jane Atwood's cou&s;in, the other in that of as &s;turdy a young and as hearty an old one, being no other than the two Atwoods, father and &s;on. The colonel's aim, therefore, was to recover his brother ju&s;tice, who, taking advantage of the new di&s;turbances, had di&s;|creetly withdrawn him&s;elf, as did Me&s;&s;rs. Miles, Sir Gui&s;e, and his amiable &s;pou&s;e, but, by the vigilance of George, they were reco|vered, and will be forthcoming when their re-appearance may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="401">Still raged the battle in the Inn yard with unabated fury, and in le&s;s than half an hour, &s;uch a collection of the halt and blind, of brui&s;ed and bloodied, of teeth di&s;placed, heads broken, women crying, children bawl|ing, and men &s;wearing, were &s;urely never before brought together out of an ho&s;pital, or indeed out of Bedlam. The two po&s;til|lions lay to all appearance defunct upon the pavement, a pair of as mi&s;erable carca&s;es as ever were dragged at the chariot wheels of any of the &s;tage coachmen of former times, when heroes, gods, and godde&s;&s;es delighted to tear their mortal victims with immortal rage, limb from limb, and indeed &s;ometimes to tear them&s;elves. The coachman him&s;elf was a man of rags, every pa&s;&s;enger having had a pull at him for obtaining a victory too dear, even at the expen&s;e of many wounds and much blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the female &s;ufferers al&s;o, all the hy&s;terical re&s;toratives, and pocket me|dicines were at work. My landlord was holding hart&s;horn to the no&s;e of one lady, my landlady chaffing the temples of another,
<PB N="393" REF="402">the chamber-maids and waiters were running again&s;t each other, and an apothecary was applying &s;alts, opodildoc, brown paper plai&s;ters &s;teeped in thieves' vinegar, volatile lineaments, &amp;c. &amp;c. while another party comforted them&s;elves with ample do&s;es of cherry-bounce, un&s;ophi&s;ticated brandy, or ho|ne&s;t hollands.</P>
<P>Meantime, the gentleman who had, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, given the alarm, as to the e&s;cape of a thief, returned, conducting that per&s;on|age by the collar, declaring, as he held the honours of his head in his hand, "that he was &s;ure of his man, for that what he had borrowed from the &s;calp would fit it to an <HI>hair.</HI> Come, gentlemen," &s;aid the hero to his three attendants, who were at the heels of the pri&s;oner, "help to e&s;cort him into a place of &s;afety." They accordingly took him into the room, which the baronet and his lady and her friend had vacated; the at|tendants followed; and as the gentleman was him&s;elf about to enter, True George plucked him gently by the coat, &s;aying, "Ble&s;s me, 'Squire Partington! is it you! as I live, Sir,
<PB N="394" REF="403">here's my ma&s;ter's parliament brother Mr.&mdash;Sir John the colonel&mdash;and we have had &s;uch a to do&mdash;but Mr.&mdash;Sir John will be &s;o glad to &s;ee you, Sir, for he was going to your honour's hou&s;e, only he was &s;topt on the way by a thief or two.</P>
<P>Partington immediately conferred on George, who was a &s;ingular favourite, the high and di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of his mo&s;t coar&s;e abu&s;e, and exclaimed in high &s;pirits, "Why then all the ra&s;cals are got together! for look you, there are the two Atwoods com|ing, with, as I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>your</HI> friends, for <HI>mine</HI> is gone into this room, with three as hone&s;t per&s;onages as him&s;elf."</P>
<P>At the name of the two Atwoods, George, &s;eeing John coming up to Partington, left them together, to enter into further explan|ations, and running to his Jane's father and brother, who had the Otleys &s;till in their gripe, he gave them a hearty welcome, and had their hands been at liberty, would have demon&s;trated his &s;incerity by the u&s;ual token. But &s;carce a moment's opportunity was given for care&s;s or conver&s;ation, as Partington
<PB N="395" REF="404">beckoned the Atwoods to advance with their pri&s;oners; and as they pa&s;&s;ed him, Partington bowed very re&s;pectfully, telling them, as he thru&s;t them into the room, where his own party were inclo&s;ed, "that they would there probably meet with an old acquaintance."</P>
<P>He now locked the door, put the key into his pocket, and clapping his own cudgel into George's hand, &s;aying, "You mu&s;t &s;tand cen|tinel here, you &s;coundrel, as you did at the inn at Ad&s;ell." He then gave his arm to John, and de&s;iring the Atwoods to follow, they &s;hut them&s;elves into the apartment, which had been before, and as the reader will pre&s;ently find was &s;till decreed, by the powers that ruled on this eventful day, to be the room of ju&s;tice. It may not, meantime, be improper to ob|&s;erve, that True George, previou&s;ly to the&s;e arrangements, had di&s;patched the turnpike man to the place where the angry ju&s;tice and his friends had betaken them&s;elves, with a &s;trict charge to have an eye on all their mo|tions, and that they might not &s;teal out of town before they had Mr.&mdash;Sir John's &s;anc|tion &s;o to do. George had, in the bu&s;tle of
<PB N="396" REF="405">affairs, taken care to order the landlord of the inn, the only one where po&s;t-chai&s;es were to be had, not to put hor&s;es to the carriage of Sir Gui&s;e, or any other, without giving him the &s;aid George notice. The turnpike man was too well plea&s;ed to find the mi&s;chiefs in which he &s;o much delighted, multiply upon him&mdash;and to think that he &s;hould not go home with an empty budget&mdash;not to execute the commands of George on this occa&s;ion with as much vigilance as if his own property and life were at &s;take.&mdash;So indefatigable are &s;ome men in the bu&s;ine&s;s of others, and &s;o offi|ciou&s;ly do they engage in puni&s;hing the follies and vices of their neighbours to the utter oblivion of their own!</P>
<P>And now, reader, having cleared the ob|&s;tructed path, which literally blocked up every loop-hole to explanation; having taken two thieves into cu&s;tody, who little expected to find a brother in that &s;pot; having conveyed, to the &s;ame &s;cene, Sir Gui&s;e and Lady Stu|art, and Valentine Miles, in a coach and four; pre&s;ented to your view two of his maje&s;ty's ju&s;tices of the peace, and &s;et them together

<PB N="398" REF="407">but veritable character of Partington <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author might have added the word <HI>exi&s;ting;</HI> for the original of this copy &s;till lives, to the delight of his friends.</NOTE>, who, under the mo&s;t unornamented leaf, con|cealed the faire&s;t fruit, and within the roughe&s;t hu&s;k &s;hut up the riche&s;t kernel. In &s;hort, he was, like John Fitzorton, earne&s;t and inde|fatigable in &s;earching out mi&s;ery and misfor|tune, of every &s;ize and of every &s;ort, purely for the &s;atisfaction of relieving it; and like John al&s;o, though utterly different in the means of effecting the &s;ame ends, he was no le&s;s per&s;evering in his re&s;earches after fraud and villainy, for the gratification of expo&s;ing it to &s;corn and infamy. His hale con&s;titu|tion, lofty courage, and ample fortune, were all knit together to produce the&s;e effects. The means, indeed, were, as ju&s;t ob&s;erved, not only di&s;&s;imilar to his friend, the Colonel's, but &s;uch as &s;carcely any other man would think of u&s;ing, but in the way of counteraction and contra|riety; yet, never did a human being more infinitely love an hone&s;t, nor more abundantly
<PB N="399" REF="408">hate a di&s;hone&s;t man&mdash;never would human being go farther, or try harder, to &s;ave the one, and hang the other.</P>
<P>The moment that he returned from taking an eternal leave of his ine&s;timable friend &s;ir Armine, which was not till almo&s;t the expir|ing hour, he hurried to his hou&s;e in London, and after bringing the whole of Sir Gui&s;e Stu|art's character into a point, he concluded it would be a meritorious thing, as well to the family in particular, as to human &s;ociety in general, to bring the noble Baronet to the gallows!</P>
<P>"The focus of that hone&s;t gentleman," &s;aid he, "pre&s;ents to my view halters by the thou&s;and; now, the &s;ummit of my ambition would be to twi&s;t them all together with my own hand, and tie them about his neck; for I can a&s;&s;ert with the Moor&mdash;
<Q>My great revenge has &s;tomach for them all.</Q>
But as this &s;upreme happine&s;s is denied me, he mu&s;t, I fancy, be put out of the world the ordinary way, and with that, I mu&s;t try to be
<PB N="400" REF="409">content. I mu&s;t learn &s;ome of my friend John's philo&s;ophy."</P>
<P>While he was in the &s;pirit of this &s;oliloquy, which he pronounced on his arrival from London&mdash;even as he was ju&s;t &s;etting down to a di&s;h of tea after his journey&mdash;the two At|woods, and their kin&s;man Jonathan Arm|&s;trong, whom he had &s;ituated in the com|fortable and independant way the reader has been informed of, came running in to know whether their patron had returned, and, to their infinite &s;atisfaction, hearing that he had ju&s;t drawn off his boots, they followed the agitated feelings which impelled them, and ru&s;hed, without a&s;king the u&s;ual que&s;tions, into his pre&s;ence. "Tell me, you dear, good-for-nothing &s;coundrels; tell me," &s;aid Parting|ton, the in&s;tant they entered&mdash;pu&s;hing them down by their &s;houlders till they were &s;eated in chairs&mdash;"which of you has gratitude and religion enough in your hearts to a&s;&s;i&s;t a &s;coundrel like your&s;elves, even my magnani|mous &s;elf, in a plan that I am forming to hang an hone&s;t man? But, before you deter|mine,
<PB N="401" REF="410">remember that you owe &s;omething to Providence, and that one good turn de&s;erves another."</P>
<P>"As <HI>your</HI> hone&s;t man, plea&s;e your honour, I have ob&s;erved, is always a rogue," replied Atwood the father, trying to conceal his di&s;|turbance of mind, "I think I may &s;afely pro|mi&s;e you my poor efforts, and I fancy I can an&s;wer for tho&s;e of my boy and his coz." Young Atwood fervently, but rather more fuddled than affrighted, declared, he would knock all the hone&s;t men in the kingdom on the head, and no que&s;tions a&s;ked, which his honour &s;hould think ought to be put to death. "But as to that," added the high-mettled youth, with increa&s;ed impetuo&s;ity, "father and I are come to wait on your honour about, as I take it, another hanging or knocking down matter: whether the party be over|hone&s;t your honour will be the be&s;t judge when you have heard the &s;tory."</P>
<P>"Tell it, you in&s;ufferable caitiff!" ex|claimed Partington.</P>
<P>"Why, then, there is a good-for-nothing rogue of a lawyer, an't plea&s;e your honour," &s;aid young Atwood.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="411">"Out upon you!" vociferated Partington "What's that you &s;ay, &s;irrah?"</P>
<P>"I a&s;k your honour's pardon," replied the youth, very gravely correcting his mi&s;take, "under favour, there is one of your honour's hone&s;te&s;t men, by trade a lawyer, who has &s;ent two ill-looking fellows into our farm, &s;wearing we owe him above two hundred pounds, though we never clapped eyes on him before; and then they to&s;&s;ed about our things, and rum|maged our boxes and drawers, and almo&s;t frightened poor mother out of her wits; whereupon I thought, your honour, it was time for me to begin&mdash;e&s;pecially as they got father by the collar, and mother &s;et up a roar, and there was no time to run for neigh|bours, and your honour's ju&s;tice&s;hip was, as I thought, from home; &s;o with that, cou&s;in Jonathan here and I, made bold to trip up one of the law-men's heels, and knock down t'other &s;mack, your honour, with back|handed &s;troke, this fa&s;hion. So we down'd with 'em both; then, wi' a couple of halters cou&s;in Jonathan, who was with us at farm, had bought at market i' th' morning"&mdash;"Yes, I had been to market, and got rather mellow,
<PB N="403" REF="412">your honour," &s;aid Jonathan, "and was in order, as I may &s;ay, for any thing; and cou&s;in Jerom is in the &s;ame way; &s;o I tied un till they &s;queak'd, and then rowl'd un into back|hou&s;e, &s;lip &s;ide kitchen, and icod, there they be now, your honour; and they took it as kindly, as thof they had been us'd to it, only one o'um gave a bit of a growle, and &s;aid &s;ummut about <HI>Sir Gui&s;e Stuart</HI> &s;hould pay for his bloody no&s;e yet!&mdash;&s;ure enough his no&s;e &s;pouted finely&mdash;&s;o thought I, as &s;ure as a gun, that &s;on of a&mdash;gentleman, Sir Gui&s;e, is at the bottom of all this: but I did not &s;tay to ax que&s;tions, thinking to get neighbours, and your honour's &s;ervants&mdash;glad enough are we your honour's come home your&s;elf, ju&s;t in the nick."</P>
<P>"Fine fellows!" in a kind of gulp, and giving a &s;ort of hy&s;terical catch at the name of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart; "Fine fellows!" &s;aid Par|tington; then doubling his fi&s;t at young At|wood and Arm&s;trong, &s;wore the &s;coundrel, meaning Atwood, &s;hould die upon the &s;pot, if he &s;topt to breathe till he had given his old ra&s;cal of a father a bumper of brandy, and
<PB N="404" REF="413">taken another him&s;elf; and made Jonathan then &s;wallow a third.</P>
<P>This command the &s;on obeyed with great di&s;patch and dexterity, declaring, when he had &s;wallowed one half of his allowance, he &s;hould now be a match for all the rogues. "I beg pardon, your honour, I mean, for all the hone&s;t gentlemen who take a fancy to come into other people's hou&s;es in Chri&s;tendom. O! but I &s;hould have told your honour," &s;aid Jonathan, "one of the&s;e genu&s;&s;es, when he fir&s;t came in, ju&s;t as uncle, aunt, and cou|&s;in, were keeping out the cold of this biting night from our &s;tomachs, and drinking to your honour's health&mdash;which we do every night, as &s;ure as the night comes, after &s;upper"&mdash;"And as I do now, God ble&s;s your honour, in the re&s;t of this brandy," interpo&s;ed Jerom, taking up the &s;tory&mdash;"one of the genu&s;&s;es &s;aid, 'We had better let'um do things quietly, and let'um take account of goods and chattels, as we could not pay money: for that lawyer him&s;elf would be down &s;hortly, and then, &s;aid he, You'll all go to pot."</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this narrative, Partington &s;napped his fingers, rubbed his hands, and
<PB N="405" REF="414">danced about the room, as if he had been hearing the extrication, in&s;tead of the involve|ment of the family in que&s;tion. "Charm|ing! noble! exhilarating! delightful! and triumphant!" exclaimed Partington, putting on his gloves and great coat, and taking his hat, and gra&s;ping the cudgel which we have celebrated in this hi&s;tory, and then leaping by bounds, rather than long &s;teps, out of the hou&s;e, the elder Atwood in one arm, and ordering Jonathan and Jerom to follow, but never &s;lackening his pace till he gained At|wood's farm, nor aught abating his demon|&s;trations of joy in his way thither, exclaiming, however, almo&s;t at every &s;tride, "It &s;hall be&mdash;it mu&s;t be&mdash;it can be no other than Sir Gui&s;e, who &s;et this amiable pair at work. I know him by his marks&mdash;I will &s;wear to his noble deeds out of a thou&s;and."</P>
<P>After &s;haking Goody Atwood, as he u&s;ually called her, by the hand, and a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he was a &s;illy good-for-nothing old woman, to whimper at her pre&s;ent unexpected good fortune, he ordered the &s;on to unlock the door of the pri&s;on-room, which being done, he
<PB N="406" REF="415">ran to the pri&s;oners, whom he found bound hand and foot, by tho&s;e halters which, had they been fa&s;tened by the hand of ju&s;tice, would have been placed in a more elevated part of the human body. "Gentlemen," &s;aid Partington, bowing him&s;elf almo&s;t to the ground, "teach me how to thank you;" here he began to draw the ropes harder in their knots; "teach me, I pray, how to expre&s;s my thanks&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;&s;incere&mdash;e&s;t&mdash;thanks"&mdash;(here three pulls and three bows)&mdash;"for making me the&mdash;happie&s;t&mdash;of mankind. But the load which you have taken from my mind is &s;o heavy&mdash;&s;o&mdash;heavy&mdash;I &s;ay"&mdash;four pulls and as many bows&mdash;"&s;o&mdash;very heavy&mdash;that I can never hope to make a &s;uitable return"&mdash;a grand jerk of the halters&mdash;"&s;uitable&mdash;return&mdash;unle&s;s it were within my power to &s;ave your necks"&mdash;here many &s;trong tugs, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, at the ropes, his foot on the body of one of the pri&s;oners&mdash;"to &s;ave&mdash;I &s;ay, your necks&mdash;for the opportunity you will give me of &s;tretching tho&s;e of the worthy&mdash;very worthy&mdash;gentleman, who &s;ent you hither. I &s;uppo&s;e you have the honour to know Sir
<PB N="407" REF="416">GUISE&mdash;STUART"&mdash;at pronoucing the name, three enormous bends and pulls.&mdash;"Yes, we do," &s;aid one of the men&mdash;"that is, we have heard of &s;uch a gentleman."&mdash;"Aye&mdash;I thought &s;o," replied Partington&mdash;"which binds me to you"&mdash;here he pulled the halters with redoubled force&mdash;"binds me to you&mdash;for ever."</P>
<P>"Take care, ma&s;ter, that your own neck is not &s;tretched, for your outrage of his ma|je&s;ty's officers, in the di&s;charge of their bounden duty," &s;aid the other captive, almo&s;t gagged, and &s;truggling like a lion in the toils; then lifting up the only eye which &s;ome former conte&s;t had left in his head, young Atwood would certainly have deprived him of this, had not Partington interpo&s;ed, by in&s;i&s;ting on the hone&s;t gentleman's being permitted to <HI>&s;ee</HI> his way to the gallows.</P>
<P>Further remarks were interrupted by the appearance of the great per&s;onage, who had &s;et the&s;e &s;ubordinate in&s;truments to work, namely, the lawyer him&s;elf. He had come po&s;t ha&s;te from London, for many great and important purpo&s;es; among&s;t which, not the
<PB N="408" REF="417">lea&s;t in "his dear love," was the pure and laudable de&s;ign of turning a whole innocent family into the &s;treets, in the bittere&s;t weather that a rigorous December ever inflicted&mdash;and that upon a mock execution in&s;tituted again&s;t them, and to be &s;erved, unle&s;s he could ob|tain a certain &s;ecurity, which was, indeed, the great object he came in &s;earch of, and of which the reader &s;hall not die in ignorance, unle&s;s his death be very &s;udden indeed. This pe&s;t of the laws of England began to exhibit a &s;pecimen of the goodne&s;s of his heart the moment he entered, by demanding, whether the di&s;tre&s;s had been made, and the goods inventoried? ob&s;erving, that he had not a &s;ingle moment to &s;pare; and unle&s;s he had &s;atisfaction, mu&s;t take them all into cu&s;tody that very night: then &s;eeing the in&s;truments of his office bound, he ca&s;t his eyes about in a wild &s;ort of &s;urprize, and, in &s;o doing, threw them on Partington and his a&s;&s;ociates, whom till then he had not noticed, and at the &s;ight of whom, though he did not per&s;onally know either, his hone&s;t con&s;cience, the only thing which even rogues cannot always bring over
<PB N="409" REF="418">as parties a&s;&s;enting&mdash;his hone&s;t con&s;cience &s;u&s;pected, perhaps in&s;tinctively, were no friends to his cau&s;e. Partington, without &s;peaking one &s;yllable, and even without making his bow, a rare omi&s;&s;ion in his dealings with a knave of di&s;tinction, gave the cue to the Atwoods and Co. and zealou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, fir&s;t in tripping up the heels, then in pinioning the arms, and, finally, in fettering the legs, of the principal, even as the legs and arms of the petty agents had been fettered and pinioned&punc; with a &s;light difference only in the materials of bondage&mdash;&s;ub&s;tituting for ropes, the handker|chiefs tied together, and the garters&mdash;which were loo&s;ened in a moment&mdash;even of the afore|&s;aid agents and principals. While this cere|mony was performing, Partington &s;ugge&s;ted a trifling alteration, which he thought might be an improvement, in the article of fa&s;tening&mdash;to wit, tying the pri&s;oners neck and heels <HI>together,</HI> and then arranging them &s;o clo&s;e that they might enjoy the benefits of a conver&s;ation, "which, no doubt," &s;aid he, "mu&s;t be inte|re&s;ting, while you and I, ye &s;coundrels, and this old good-for-nothing whimpering wo|man,"
<PB N="410" REF="419">&s;aid Partington, pointing to Mrs. Atwood, "retire to the Bury, and con&s;ult about their future promotion. Meantime, worthy gentlemen," continued Partington, "I will, by virtue of mine office, perform the duty of &s;earching your pockets, convinced, that I &s;hall find nothing therein but the mo&s;t unequivocal te&s;timonies of your virtue and humanity!"</P>
<P>Partington's hands were ran&s;acking the pockets of the pri&s;oner in chief, and the At|woods and Jonathan tho&s;e of the &s;ubalterns in captivity, all the time they were thus &s;peak|ing: then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the &s;poil, the parties, thus <HI>literally bound</HI> over to their better behaviour, were packed in the way Partington propo&s;ed. The windows were made fa&s;t, neither fire or candle allowed, every article of furniture moved out of the room, a comfortable cold brick floor was their bed; the key of the &s;treet door was then turned upon the vanqui&s;hed, and the con|querors marched away, taking Goody At|wood in protection to head-quarters, at Par|tington-Bury.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="420">Here, over a bottle of the be&s;t wine which Partington's cellar afforded, the victorious party examined the plunder which they had taken from the enemy. It con&s;i&s;ted of the following intere&s;ting particulars, a commen|tary on which would call for a hundred pens, each of them better at de&s;cription than ours, and yet, which any &s;ingle per&s;on, with a heart as hone&s;t as that of Partington, Jonathan Arm&s;trong, or the Atwoods, may furni&s;h, as he reads. But the&s;e particulars are of too great con&s;equence not to be given in an ap|propriate Chapter, nay, they &s;hall even have the honour, on account of the <HI>di&s;coveries</HI> they unfolded, to open the Fourth Volume of our FAMILY SECRETS.</P>
