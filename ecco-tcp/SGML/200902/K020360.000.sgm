<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE title page announces the termination of my authorial exi&s;tence, which took place on <HI>March</HI> 1&s;t, 1791. Since that period, I have glided through the globe a harmle&s;s &s;prite; have pervaded the continents of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and de&s;cribed them with the &s;ame authenticity as <HI>Gemelli Careri,</HI> or many other tra|vellers, ideal or real, who are to this day read with avi|dity, and quoted with faith. My great change is not per|ceived by mortal eyes. I &s;till haunt the bench of ju&s;|tices. I am now active in ha&s;tening levies of our generous <HI>Britons</HI> into the field. However unequal, I &s;till retain the &s;ame zeal in the &s;ervices of my country; and twice &s;ince my departure, have experienced human pa&s;&s;ions, and have grown indignant at injuries offered to my native land; or have incited a vigorous defence again&s;t the lunatic de&s;igns of enthu&s;ia&s;tic tyranny, or the pre&s;umptuous plans of fanatical athei&s;ts to &s;pread their reign and force their tenets on the contented moral part of their fellow creatures. May I remain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
<PB REF="4">the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions till the great EXORCIST lays me for ever. The two la&s;t numbers in the following pages are my po&s;t-exi&s;tent performances. Surviving friends, &s;mile on the attempts! Surviving enemy, if any I can NOW have, forgive my errors!</P>

<Q>VIXI ET QUEM DEDERAT CURSUM FORTUNA PEREGI.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ORIGINAL CAUSE OF MY STUDIES.</NOTE> A PRESENT of the ornithology of <HI>Francis Willughby,</HI> e&s;q. made to me, when I was about the age of twelve, by my kin&s;man the late <HI>John Sali&s;bury,</HI>e&s;q. of <HI>Bachegraig,</HI> in the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> father of the fair and celebrated writer Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> fir&s;t gave me a ta&s;te for that &s;tudy, and incidentally a love for that of natural hi&s;tory in general, which I have &s;ince pur&s;ued with my con&s;titutional ardor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A TOUR IN CORNWAL, 1746 OR 7.</NOTE> A TOUR I made into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> from <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the year 1746 or 1747, gave me a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for minerals and fo&s;&s;ils, in which I was greatly encouraged by that able and worthy man, the late reverend doctor <HI>William Borla&s;e</HI> of <HI>Ludgvan,</HI> who, in the kinde&s;t manner, communicated to me every thing worthy my notice.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing of mine which appeared in print was in&s;erted unknown to me; an ab&s;tract of a letter I had written to my ever venerated friend and uncle <HI>James Mytton,</HI>e&s;q. on an earth|quake which was felt at <HI>Downing, April</HI> the 2d, 1750. This, with &s;everal &s;imilar te&s;timonies, may be &s;een in the xth volume of the Abridgment of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, p. 511.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9"><NOTE PLACE="marg">ELECTED FEL|LOW OF THE SO|CIETY OF ANTI|QUARIES.</NOTE> HAVING an inclination to the &s;tudy of antiquities, I was, on <HI>November</HI> the 21&s;t, 1754, elected a fellow of the &s;ociety of an|tiquaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RESIGN.</NOTE> THIS honor I re&s;igned about the year 1760. I had married a mo&s;t amiable woman; my circum&s;tances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happine&s;s would have been permanent, and that I never &s;hould have been called again from my retirement to amu&s;e my&s;elf in town, or to be of u&s;e to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VISIT IRELAND IN 1754.</NOTE> IN the &s;ummer of 1754 I vi&s;ited the ho&s;pitable kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and travelled from <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Balli-Ca&s;tle,</HI> the <HI>Giants-Cau&s;e|way, Colraine,</HI> the extremity of the county of <HI>Donegal, London-Derry, Strabone, Innis-killen, Galway, Limcrick,</HI> the lake of <HI>Kil|larney, Kin&s;ale, Cork, Ca&s;hel, Waterford, Kilkenny, Dublin.</HI> But &s;uch was the conviviality of the country, that my journal proved as <HI>maigre</HI> as my entertainment was <HI>gras,</HI> &s;o it never was a di&s;h fit to be offered to the public.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ACCOUNT OF SOME CORAL|LOIDS, 1756.</NOTE> In the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of 1756, vol. xlix. p. 513, is a trifling paper of mine, on &s;everal coralloid bodies, I had collected at <HI>Coal brook-dale,</HI> in <HI>Shrop&s;hire.</HI> It is accompanied by a plate engraven from &s;ome drawings by <HI>Watkin Williams,</HI> a per&s;on who at that time was an humble companion of my father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IN 1757 ELECTED OF THE R. S. AT UPSAL.</NOTE> On <HI>February,</HI> 1757, I received the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of my literary honors. I value my&s;elf the more on its being con|ferred on me, at the in&s;tance of <HI>Linnaeus</HI> him&s;elf, with whom I had began a corre&s;pondence in 1755. I had &s;ent him an account of a recent <HI>concha anomia,</HI> which I found adhering to a &s;ea-plant of the <HI>Norwegian</HI> &s;eas, &s;ent to me by bi&s;hop <HI>Pontoppi|dan.
<PB N="3" REF="10">Hanc,</HI> &s;ays the great naturali&s;t, <HI>recitavi in &s;ocietatis regiae Up&s;alien&s;is, publico con&s;e&s;&s;u,</HI> 1757, <HI>d.</HI> 17 <HI>Februarii, quam collegae et &s;ocii omnes avidi&s;&s;im&egrave; excipiebant et mirati &s;unt; te quoque codem die membrum praefatae &s;ocietatis unanimo con&s;en&s;u elegere omnes, et mibi in mandatis dedere hoc tibi &s;ignificandi; prob&egrave; per&s;ua&s;i te excep|turum hoc eorum officium benevol&egrave;, ob amorem quem &s;ers in &s;cientias et omnia quae u&s;ui publico in&s;erviant.</HI> My corre&s;pondence conti|nued with this illu&s;trious per&s;onage till age and infirmities obliged him to de&s;i&s;t. He did me the honor of accepting all my labors publi&s;hed before the year 1774. He &s;poke of them in terms too favorable for me to repeat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOLIO EDITION OF THE BRITISH ZOOLOGY, 1761.</NOTE> About the year 1761 I began my <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology,</HI> which, when completed, con&s;i&s;ted of cxxxii plates on imperial paper. They were all engraven by Mr. <HI>Peter Mazel,</HI> now living, and of who&s;e &s;kill and integrity I had always occa&s;ion to &s;peak well. The painter was Mr. <HI>Peter Pallou,</HI> an excellent arti&s;t, but too fond of giving gaudy colours to his &s;ubjects. He painted, for my hall, at <HI>Downing,</HI> &s;everal pictures of birds and animals, at|tended with &s;uitable land&s;capes. Four were intended to re|pre&s;ent the climates. The frigid zone, and an <HI>European</HI> &s;cene of a farm-yard, are particularly well done; all have their merit, but occa&s;ion me to lament his conviviality, which affected his circum&s;tances and abridged his days.</P>
<P>THE worthy and ingenious <HI>George Edwards,</HI> that admirable ornithologi&s;t, at fir&s;t conceived a little jealou&s;y on my attempt: but it very &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided. We became very intimate, and he continued to his dying day ready and earne&s;t to promote all my labors. He pre&s;ented me, as a proof of his friend&s;hip, with numbers of the original drawings from which his etchings had
<PB N="4" REF="11">been formed. The&s;e I keep, not only in re&s;pect to his me|mory, but as curious te&s;timonies of his faithful and elegant pencil.</P>
<P>I dedicated the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology</HI> to the benefit of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> &s;chool, near <HI>Gray's-inn-lane, London,</HI> and &s;upported the far greater part of the expence. I lo&s;t con&s;iderably by it, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal gentlemen contributed. My agent was that very hone&s;t man, Mr. <HI>Richard Morris,</HI> of the navy office. His widow was left in narrow circum&s;tances, I therefore permitted her to keep the plates, and make what advantage &s;he could of them. I was, at the time of undertaking this work, unexperienced in the&s;e affairs, and was ill-advi&s;ed to publi&s;h on &s;uch large paper; had it been originally in quarto, the &s;chool would have been con&s;iderably benefited by it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">JOURNEY TO THE CONTINENT, 1765.</NOTE> THIS work was for a time left unfini&s;hed, by rea&s;on of a &s;hort tour I made to the continent. I le&s;t <HI>London</HI> on <HI>February</HI> the 19th, 1765, pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>St. Omer, Aire, Arras, Perron,</HI> and acro&s;s the great fore&s;t to <HI>Chantilli,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Paris.</HI> I made &s;ome &s;tay at that capital, and was during the time made happy in the company of the celebrated naturali&s;t <HI>Le Comte de Buffon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LE COMTE DE BUFFON.</NOTE> with whom I pa&s;&s;ed much of the time. He was &s;ati&s;|fied with my proficiency in natural hi&s;tory, and publickly ac|knowleged his favorable &s;entiments of my &s;tudies in the fif|teenth volume of his <HI>Hi&s;toire Naturelle.</HI> Unfortunately, long before I had any thoughts of enjoying the honor of his ac|quaintance, I had, in my <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology,</HI> made a compari&s;on between the free-thinking philo&s;opher and our great and re|ligious countryman Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> much to the advantage of the lat|ter. The &s;ubject was a Mole, really too ridiculous to have been
<PB N="5" REF="12">noticed; but &s;uch was his irritability, that, in the fir&s;t volume of his <HI>Hi&s;toire Naturelle des Oi&s;eaux,</HI> he fell on me mo&s;t unmer|cifully, but happily often without rea&s;on. He probably relented, for in the following volumes he frequently made u&s;e of my au|thority, which fully atoned for a ha&s;ty and mi&s;guided fit of pa&s;|&s;ion. I did not wi&s;h to quarrel with a gentleman I truly e&s;|teemed, yet, unwilling to remain quite pa&s;&s;ive, in my Index to his admirable works, and the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;cs,</HI> I did venture to repel his principal charge, and, <HI>con amore,</HI> to retaliate on my illu&s;trious a&s;&s;ailant. Our blows were light, and I hope that nei|ther of us felt any material injury.</P>
<P>I MUST blame the <HI>Comte</HI> for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his acknowlegement of &s;everal communications of animals which I &s;ent to him for the illu&s;tration of his <HI>Hi&s;tcire Naturelle.</HI> One was his <HI>Conguar Noir,</HI> Suppl. iii. 223. tab. lxii; my <HI>Jaguar</HI> or <HI>Black Tiger,</HI> Hi&s;t. Quadr. 1. N^o 190. Another was the drawing of his <HI>I&s;atis,</HI> Suppl. iii. tab. xvii. which he attributes to good <HI>Peter Collin&s;on.</HI> The third was his <HI>Chacal Adive</HI> of the &s;ame work, p. 112. tab. xvi; and my <HI>Barbary</HI> Fox, Hi&s;t. Quadr. 1. N^o 171, of which I furni&s;hed him with the de&s;igns. The&s;e are no great matters: I lament them only as &s;mall defects in a great character.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">AT MONBARD.</NOTE> I took the u&s;ual road to <HI>Lyon,</HI> excepting a &s;mall digre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in compliance with the friendly invitation of the <HI>Comte,</HI> to pa&s;s a few days with him in his &s;eat at <HI>Monbard.</HI> His hou&s;e was built at the foot of a hill crowned with a ruined ca&s;tle: he had converted the ca&s;tle-yard into a garden, and fitted up one of the towers into a &s;tudy. To that place he re|tired every morning, about &s;even o'clock, to compo&s;e his ex|cellent works, free from all interruption. He continued there
<PB N="6" REF="13">till between one and two, when he returned, dined with his fa|mily, and gave up the whole remainder of the day to them and his friends, whom he entertained with the mo&s;t agreeable and rational conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLTAIRE.</NOTE> AT <HI>Ferney,</HI> in the extremity of the &s;ame province, I vi&s;ited that wicked wit <HI>Voltaire;</HI> he happened to be in good-humour, and was very entertaining; but, in his attempt to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;atisfied us that he was perfect ma&s;ter of our oaths and our cur&s;es.</P>
<P>THE forenoon was not the proper time to vi&s;it <HI>Voltaire;</HI> he could not bear to have his hours of &s;tudy interrupted; this alone was enough to put him in bad humour, and not without rea&s;on. Le&s;&s;er people may have the &s;ame cau&s;e of complaint, when a lounger, who has no one thing to do, breaks on their hours of writing, e&s;timates the value of their time by his own, and di|verts their attention in the mo&s;t pretious hours of the rural morning.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lyon</HI> I went to <HI>Grenoble</HI> and the <HI>Grand Chartreu&s;e, Cham|berri,</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> and from thence over the greate&s;t part of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland.</HI> At <HI>Bern</HI> I commenced acquaintance with that excellent man the late baron <HI>Haller,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BARON HALLER.</NOTE> who, on every occa&s;ion, &s;hewed the utmo&s;t alacrity to promote my pur&s;uits. At <HI>Zurich</HI> with the two <HI>Ge&s;ners,</HI> the poet and the naturali&s;t; the la&s;t the de&s;cendant of the great <HI>Conrad Ge&s;ner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ulm</HI> and <HI>Aug&s;burg</HI> were the fir&s;t cities I vi&s;ited in <HI>Germany. Donawert, Nurenberg, Erlang, Bamberg,</HI> and <HI>Frankfort</HI> on the <HI>Maine</HI> &s;ucceeded. At the declining city of <HI>Nurenberg</HI> I vi&s;ited doctor <HI>Trew,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">DOCTOR TREW.</NOTE> a venerable patron of natural hi&s;tory. At <HI>Mentz</HI> I embarked on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and fell down that magnificent river
<PB N="7" REF="14">as low as <HI>Cologne.</HI> From <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp</HI> I went to <HI>Xanten,</HI> and from thence reached <HI>Holland;</HI> few parts of which I left unvi&s;ited.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DOCTOR PALLAS.</NOTE> I e&s;teem my meeting with doctor <HI>Pallas,</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> a momentous affair, for it gave ri&s;e to my <HI>Synop&s;is of Quadrupeds,</HI> and the &s;econd edition, under the name of the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Quadru|peds;</HI> a work received by the naturali&s;ts of different parts of <HI>Europe</HI> in a manner uncommonly favorable. This and the fol|lowing year, doctor <HI>Pallas</HI> re&s;ided at the <HI>Hague.</HI> From conge|niality of di&s;po&s;ition we &s;oon became &s;trongly attached. Our conver&s;ation rolled chiefly on natural hi&s;tory, and, as we were both enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers of our great <HI>Ray,</HI> I propo&s;ed his un|dertaking a hi&s;tory of quadrupeds on the &s;y&s;tem of our illu&s;|trious countryman a little reformed. He a&s;&s;ented to my plan, and, on <HI>January</HI> the 18th, 1766, he wrote to me a long letter, in which he &s;ent an outline of his de&s;ign, and his re&s;olution to pur&s;ue it with all the expedition con&s;i&s;tent with his other en|gagements. But this work was fated to be accompli&s;hed by an inferior genius. In the next year he returned to <HI>Berlin,</HI> his native place; his abilities began to be highly celebrated; his fame reached the court of <HI>Peter&s;burgh,</HI> and the empre&s;s, not more to her own honor than that of my friend, invited him into her &s;ervice, and in 1768 placed him at the head of one of the philo&s;ophical expeditions projected for di&s;covery in the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of her va&s;t dominions. This was an expedition worthy of <HI>Pallas;</HI> it began in <HI>June</HI> 1768, and was concluded on the 30th of <HI>July</HI> 1774. It unfolded all his great talents, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his fame equal at left to the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers of the age. He was lo&s;t to me during that period. On hear|ing of his return I wrote to him at <HI>Peter&s;burgh,</HI> and &s;ent to
<PB N="8" REF="15">him all the works I had publi&s;hed &s;ince our &s;eparation; he re|ceived them with the candor which only great minds po&s;&s;e&s;s at the fight of the &s;ucce&s;sful labors of others. On <HI>November</HI> the 4th, 1777, I received from him the fir&s;t letter of our renewed corre&s;pondence, which continued &s;everal years, to my great in|&s;truction. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed nothing that could be of &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of literature, nor did he de&s;i&s;t, till, overpowered with bu&s;ine&s;s, he dropt all epi&s;tolary duties except tho&s;e which were official. To this day he convinces me of his friend&s;hip by con|&s;tant pre&s;ents of the productions of his celebrated pen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. GRONOVIUS.</NOTE> AT <HI>Leyden</HI> I had the plea&s;ure of making a per&s;onal acquaint|ance with my worthy corre&s;pondent doctor <HI>Lawrence Theodore Gronovius,</HI> de&s;cended from a race celebrated for their immen&s;e erudition; his own labors will remain la&s;ting proofs of his be|ing an undegenerated &s;on.</P>
<P>On <HI>February</HI> the 26th, 1767, I was elected Fellow of our Royal Society.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRITISH ZOOLOCY, SECOND EDITION, 1768.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Benjamin White,</HI> book&s;eller, propo&s;ed to me the republi|cation of the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology,</HI> which was done in 1768, in two volumes, octavo, illu&s;trated with xvii plates; he payed me &pound;.100 for my permi&s;&s;ion, which I immediately ve&s;ted in the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> charity &s;chool. I may here ob&s;erve, that <HI>M. de Murre,</HI> of <HI>Nurenbergh,</HI> tran&s;lated the folio edition into <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and publi&s;hed it in that &s;ize, with the plates copied and colored by the ingenious arti&s;ts of that city.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>May</HI> of this year I met Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Banks,</HI> then Mr. <HI>Banks,</HI> at <HI>Reve&s;by Abby,</HI> his &s;eat in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire;</HI> during my &s;tay I made many ob&s;ervations on the zoology of the country, and mu&s;t acknowlege the various obligations I lie under to that
<PB N="9" REF="16">gentleman for his liberal communications re&s;ulting from the uncommon extent of his travels.</P>
<P>I MAY here mention, that our fir&s;t acquaintance commenced on <HI>March</HI> 19th, 1766, when he called on me at my lodgings in <HI>St. James's Street,</HI> and pre&s;ented me with that &s;carce book <HI>Turner de Avibus,</HI> &amp;c. a gift I retain as a valuable proof of his e&s;teem. An unhappy interruption of our friend&s;hip once took place, but it recommenced, I tru&s;t, to the content of both par|ties, in a fortunate moment, in <HI>March</HI> 1790.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A THIRD VO|LUME OF FISHES, &amp;c. 1769.</NOTE> IN 1769 I added to the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology</HI> a third volume in, octavo, on the reptiles and fi&s;hes of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> This was illu&s;trated with xvii plates.</P>
<P>IN the preceding year &s;ir JOSEPH BANKS communicated to me a new &s;pecies of <HI>Pinguin,</HI> brought by captain <HI>Machride</HI> from the <HI>Falkland</HI> i&s;lands. I drew up an account of it, and of all the other &s;pecies then known, and laid it before the <HI>Royal Society.</HI> They were plea&s;ed to direct that it &s;hould be publi&s;hed, which was done in this year, in the lviiith volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI> It was accompanied by a figure. It is not a good one, the &s;kin having been too much di&s;tended: but in the &s;econd edition of my <HI>Genera of Birds</HI> a mo&s;t faithful repre&s;enta|tion is given, taken from the life by doctor <HI>Reinhold For&s;ter.</HI> I named it <HI>Patagonian,</HI> not only on account of the &s;ize, but be|cau&s;e it is very common in the neighborhood of that race of tall men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">INDIAN ZOOLO|GY, 1769.</NOTE> MY mind was always in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate, it never could &s;tagnate; this carried me farther than the limits of our i&s;land, and made me de&s;irous of forming a zoology of &s;ome di&s;tant country, by which I might relieve my pen by the plea&s;ure of

He offered to me the u&s;e of them, in a manner that &s;hewed his liberal turn. Twelve plates, in &s;mall folio, were engraven at the joint ex|pence of &s;ir <HI>Jo&s;eph Banks,</HI> Mr. <HI>Loten,</HI> and my&s;elf; to which I added de&s;criptions and little e&s;&s;ays. I forget how the work cea&s;ed to proceed; but remember that, at my per&s;ua&s;ion, the plates were be&s;towed on doctor <HI>John Reinhold For&s;ter,</HI> together with three more engraven at my own expence. The&s;e he took with him into <HI>Germany,</HI> faithfully tran&s;lated the letter-pre&s;s into <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>German,</HI> and added a mo&s;t ingenious differtation on the climate, winds, and &s;oil of <HI>India,</HI> and another on the birds of <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> all which he publi&s;hed at <HI>Halle,</HI> in <HI>Saxony,</HI> in 1781.</P>

In every tour I made I kept a regular journal, all which are placed apart in my libra|ry; the&s;e I wi&s;h never to be made public, as they may contain inaccuracies, either from ha&s;te or mi&s;information: yet, as they contain many de&s;criptions of buildings, and accounts of places in the &s;tate they were at the time they were made, they ought not totally to be neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es Griffiths</HI> made numbers of drawings: my ingenious friend Mr. <HI>Gro&s;e</HI> honored me with u&s;ing &s;everal for his fine work of the Antiquities of <HI>England;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. HUTCHIN|SON.</NOTE> and I believe Mr. <HI>Hut|chin&s;on,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="26">of <HI>Bernard Ca&s;tle,</HI> will do the &s;ame in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Durbam.</HI></P>
<P>I COMMENCED a friend&s;hip with that gentleman in this jour|ney, in a mo&s;t &s;ingular manner: I was mounted on the famous &s;tones in the church-yard of <HI>Penrith,</HI> to take a nearer view of them, and &s;ee whether the drawing I had procured, done by the rev. doctor <HI>Tod,</HI> had the le&s;t foundation in truth. Thus en|gaged, a per&s;on of good appearance, looking up at me, ob&s;erved "what fine work Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> had made with tho&s;e &s;tones!" I &s;aw he had got into a horrible &s;crape; &s;o, unwilling to make bad wor&s;e, de&s;cended, laid hold of his button, and told him, "I am the man!" After his confu&s;ion was over, I made a &s;hort de|fence, &s;hook him by the hand, and we became from that moment fa&s;t friends.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of part of this journey will be found among my po&s;thumous works, fairly tran&s;cribed, neatly bound in vellum, and richly illu&s;trated with drawings by <HI>Mo&s;es Griffith,</HI> and with prints. This will take in the &s;pace from <HI>Downing</HI> to <HI>Orford,</HI> the &s;eat of my worthy and venerable friend the late <HI>John Blackburne,</HI>e&s;q. From thence to <HI>Know&s;ly, Sephton, Orm&s;kirk, Latham,</HI> and (cro&s;&s;ing the country) to <HI>Blackborn, Whalley-abby, Ribche&s;ter, Mitton, Waddington-hall,</HI> and <HI>Clithero,</HI> mo&s;t of them in the county of <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> In that of <HI>York,</HI> I vi&s;ited <HI>Sally-abby, Bolton-hall, Malham Coves, Settle, Giggle&s;wick,</HI> and <HI>Ingleton.</HI></P>
<P>I THEN cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Lune</HI> to <HI>Kirkby Lon&s;dale,</HI> and vi&s;ited all the parts of <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> omitted in my printed tours of 1769 and 1772: and finally I fini&s;hed this M.S. vo|lume at <HI>Al&s;ton,</HI> near the borders of <HI>Durham.</HI> For a more full

<P>IN <HI>May</HI> 1784, I had the di&s;tingui&s;hed honor of being elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Stock|holm.</HI> In <HI>Sweden</HI> I am favored with the corre&s;pondence of doctor <HI>Thunberg</HI> of <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> doctor <HI>Sparman</HI> of <HI>Stockholm,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wilcke</HI> of the &s;ame city, and Mr. <HI>Odman</HI> of <HI>Wormden,</HI> not re|mote from <HI>Stockholm.</HI> I mu&s;t not forget a grateful tribute to the memory of departed friends, to that of baron de <HI>Geer,</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;or <HI>Wallerius,</HI> and above all doctor <HI>Solander;</HI> the la&s;t &s;o di&s;|tingui&s;hed by urbanity of manners, and liberality of communi|cation of the infinite knowlege he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Jan.</HI> the 3d, 1785, I was elected honorary member of the &s;ociety at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for promoting of natural know|ledge.</P>
<P>ON <HI>March</HI> the 5th I received the &s;ame honor from the So|ciety of Antiquaries at <HI>Perth.</HI></P>
<P>AND on <HI>December</HI> the 24th was honored by being elected member of the Agriculture Society, at <HI>Odiham,</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUPPLEMENT TO THE ARCTIC ZOOLOGY.</NOTE> IN 1787 I gave a Supplement to the <HI>Arctic Zoology;</HI> it con|tains &s;everal additions and corrections, which I owe to the friend|&s;hip of my &s;everal northern corre&s;pondents, and a &s;y&s;tematic
<PB N="31" REF="40">account of the reptiles and fi&s;hes of <HI>North America,</HI> together with two very beautiful maps of the countries I had treated of in the introduction, (corrected &s;ince the fir&s;t publication) en|graven by that excellent arti&s;t Mr. <HI>William Palmer.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOUR TO THE LAND'S END.</NOTE> EVER &s;ince the year 1777 I had quite lo&s;t my &s;pirit of ram|bling. Another happy nuptial connection &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every de&s;ire to leave my fire-&s;ide. But in the &s;pring of this year I was induced once more to renew my journies. My &s;on had returned from his fir&s;t tour to the continent, &s;o much to my &s;atisfaction, that I was determined to give him every advan|tage that might qualify him for a &s;econd, which he was on the point of taking over the kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I wi&s;hed him to make a compari&s;on of the naval &s;trength and commercial advantages and di&s;advantages of our i&s;land, with tho&s;e of her two powerful rivals; I attended him down the <HI>Thames;</HI> vi&s;ited all our docks; and by land (from <HI>Dartford</HI>) followed the whole coa&s;t to the very <HI>Land's End.</HI> On his re|turn from his &s;econd tour, I had great rea&s;on to boa&s;t that this excur&s;ion was not thrown away; as to my&s;elf it was a painful one; long ab&s;ence from my family was &s;o new to me, that I may &s;incerely &s;ay it ca&s;t an anxiety over the whole journey.</P>
<P>THESE were my greater labors. I, at &s;everal times, gave to the public &s;ome trifles, which were not ill-received; but few knew the author. The&s;e I collected &s;ome years ago, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MISCELLANIES.</NOTE> and printed, for the amu&s;ement of a few friends, thirty copies, by the friendly pre&s;s of <HI>George Allan,</HI> e&s;q. at <HI>Darlington.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HISTORY OF THE PATAGONIANS.</NOTE> THE principal was my hi&s;tory of the <HI>Patagonians,</HI> collected from the account given by father <HI>Faulkner,</HI> in 1771, and from the &s;everal hi&s;tories of tho&s;e people by various writers. I believe
<PB N="32" REF="41">that the authenticity of the &s;everal relaters is now very well e&s;tabli&s;hed. This was printed at the &s;ame pre&s;s, in 1788.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e may be added, the <HI>ode on indifference,</HI> and the ver&s;es on the lady being cho&s;en patrone&s;s of a hunt and book-club in the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>AN e&s;&s;ay on the improper behaviour of married ladies to|wards our &s;ex, 1774.</P>
<P>A RIDICULE on the bold and ma&s;culine fa&s;hion of the ladies wearing riding-habits at all times of the day; which was republi&s;hed, in 1781, by Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> with a good mezzotinto of a modern toilet.</P>
<P>AMERICAN annals, an incitement to parlement-men to inquire into the conduct of our commanders in the <HI>American</HI> war. I omit this paper, unwilling to revive the memory of the mo&s;t deplorable event in all the annals of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> petition. The di&s;contents of the year 1779 were grown to &s;uch a height, that the county of <HI>Flint</HI> took &s;hare in the attempt to produce a redre&s;s of grievances. I wi&s;hed to allay the popular fury as far as in me lay; becau&s;e num|bers of the complaints were excited by that bane of this king|dom in all ages, pretended patriots. I formed a &s;peech, which I had not courage enough to &s;peak, &s;o printed the lenitive in|tention, as certainly it could do me no di&s;credit. The event &s;hewed that impo&s;&s;ibilities were attempted, and that &s;oon as the patriots got into power, no more was thought of the plan once urged with much violence.</P>
<P>AN in&s;cription over the entrance of the new gaol at <HI>Flint</HI> is printed in Mr. <HI>Howard</HI>'s account of the principal <HI>Lazarettos</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THE following grateful epitaph, in memory of my faithful
<PB N="33" REF="42">&s;ervant and friend, <HI>Louis Gold,</HI> may be &s;een on a &s;mall bra&s;s plate in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church, clo&s;e to which he was interred, <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 22d, 1785.</P>
<Q>This &s;mall Monument of e&s;teem was erected by his lamenting Ma&s;ter in Memory of LOUIS GOLD, a Norman by Birth, and above twenty years the faithful Servant and Friend of THOMAS PENNANT, E&s;q. of Downing. In his various &s;ervices he made con&s;iderable &s;avings, which he di&s;po&s;ed of by his la&s;t will (having no relations of his own) with affection to his friends and to his fellow-&s;ervants, with unmerited gratitude to his Ma&s;ter and his family, and with piety to the poor. Every duty of his humble &s;tation, and every duty of life, he di&s;charged &s;o fully, That when the day &s;hall come which levels all di&s;tinction of ranks, He may, By the favour of our ble&s;&s;ed Mediator. hear the&s;e joyful words,
<PB N="34" REF="43">"Well done, thou good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." He was born at St. Hermes de Rouvelle, in Normandy, Augu&s;t 22, 1717; died at Downing, Augu&s;t 20, 1785; and was interred in the Church-yard near this wall on the 22d of the &s;ame month.</Q>
<P>PREVIOUS to this I could not, in the warmth of my heart, re|&s;i&s;t giving, in one of the <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> papers, the following paragraph as a notification of his death.</P>
<P><Q>SATURDAY &s;e'nnight, in the morning, died, at <HI>Downing,</HI> in <HI>Flint&s;hire, Louis Gold,</HI> a <HI>Norman</HI> by birth, and above twenty years the faithful &s;ervant and friend of <HI>Thomas Pennant,</HI> of that place, e&s;q.. He left the &s;avings of his different &s;ervices, which were very con&s;iderable, to &s;everal of his friends, his fellow-&s;ervants, and to the poor; and bequeathed to his lamenting ma&s;ter, and his four children, hand&s;ome remembrances of his affection for them: the remainder to be applied, at the di&s;cretion of his ex|ecutor, to charitable u&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1790. ACCOUNT OF LONDON.</NOTE> THIS &s;pring I publi&s;hed an account of our capital. I had &s;o often walked about the &s;everal parts of <HI>London,</HI> with my note|book in my hand, that I could not help forming con&s;iderable collections of materials. The public received this work with the utmo&s;t avidity. It went through three large impre&s;&s;ions in about two years and a half. The fir&s;t, in <HI>April</HI> 1790; the &s;econd, in <HI>January</HI> 1791; and the third, in the latter end of the la&s;t year.

<P>IN this year Mr. <HI>White</HI> &s;ent into the world a fifth edition of my <HI>Tours in Scotland,</HI> with &s;everal additions and corrections.</P>
<P>I AM often a&s;toni&s;hed at the multiplicity of my publications, e&s;pecially when I reflect on the various duties it has fallen to my lot to di&s;charge. As father of a family, landlord of a &s;mall but very numerous tenantry, and a not inactive magi&s;trate. I had a great &s;hare of health during the literary part of my days, much of this was owing to the riding exerci&s;e of my exten&s;ive tours, to my manner of living, and to my temperance. I go to re&s;t at ten; and ri&s;e winter and &s;ummer at &s;even, and &s;have re|gular at the &s;ame hour, being a true <HI>mi&s;opogon.</HI> I avoid the meal of exce&s;s, a &s;upper; and my &s;oul ri&s;es with vigour to its employs, and (I tru&s;t) does not di&s;appoint the end of its Creator.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DOCTOR JOHN REINHOLD FOR|STER.</NOTE> I, VERY early after the arrival of doctor <HI>John Reinhold For&s;ter,</HI> had opportunity of introducing him to &s;everal of my friends, which proved of no &s;mall &s;ervice to him during his re&s;idence in this kingdom. At my per&s;ua&s;ion, and by my encouragement, he tran&s;lated <HI>Kalm's Voyage into North America,</HI> which was publi&s;hed in 1770, in three volumes octavo.</P>
<P>IN 1771 he publi&s;hed <HI>O&s;beck's Voyage to China,</HI> with that of <HI>Torcen,</HI> and <HI>Eckberg</HI>'s account of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> hu&s;bandry, in two volumes.</P>

<P>I PUBLISHED, at much expence, in 1777, the <HI>Flora Scotica,</HI> in two volumes, octavo, with xxxvii plates. This was the elabo|rate work of my worthy friend, and fellow traveller, the rev.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">REV.

I publi&s;hed his journal, entitled, <HI>Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland,</HI> at my own hazard. It is illu&s;trated with xxii plates, taken from drawings by the &s;kilful pencil of that ingenious traveller. The work &s;ucceeded.

<P>NUMBERS of other &s;ubjects of antiquities, views, and natural hi&s;tory, are now in publication by the &s;ame gentleman.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">REV. GEORGE LOW.</NOTE> I WAS actuated by the &s;ame zeal in re&s;pect to the extreme i&s;lands of the &s;ame parts of our kingdom. In the reverend Mr. <HI>George Low,</HI> mini&s;ter of <HI>Bir&s;a</HI> in the <HI>Orknies,</HI> I met with a gentleman willing to undertake the vi&s;itation of tho&s;e i&s;lands, and of the <HI>Schetlands,</HI> and to communicate to me his ob&s;erva|tions of every thing he imagined would be of u&s;e to the king|dom, or afford me plea&s;ure. His &s;urveys were made in the years 1774 and 1778, and he favored me with a mo&s;t in&s;truc|tive journal, and &s;everal drawings. It was my wi&s;h to publi&s;h his voyages, as I had the travels of Mr. <HI>Cordiner;</HI> but certain rea&s;ons di&s;couraged me. This ought not to be con&s;idered as
<PB N="38" REF="47">any reflection on the performance. Mr. <HI>Low</HI> gives a good ac|count of the natural hi&s;tory and antiquities of the &s;everal i&s;lands; enters deeply into their fi&s;heries and commercial concerns; and on the whole is highly worthy the attention of the public.</P>

<P>NONE of my acquaintance will deny that I write a mo&s;t ille|gible hand.

<P>A FEW years ago I grew fond of imaginary tours, and de|termined on one to climes more &s;uited to my years, more ge|nial than that to the frozen north.

From <HI>London</HI> I follow the coa&s;ts &s;outhern to part of our i&s;land, and from <HI>Calais,</HI> along the oceanic &s;hores of <HI>Europe, Africa,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> till I have attained tho&s;e of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> Re&s;pecting the&s;e, I have collected every informa|tion po&s;&s;ible, from books antient and modern: from the mo&s;t authentic, and from living travellers of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable cha|racters of my time. I mingle hi&s;tory, natural hi&s;tory, accounts of the coa&s;ts, climates, and every thing which I thought could in&s;truct or amu&s;e. They are written on imperial quarto, and when bound, make a folio of no incon&s;iderable &s;ize; and are illu&s;trated, at a va&s;t expence, by prints taken from books, or
<PB N="41" REF="50">by charts and maps, and by drawings by the &s;kilful hand of <HI>Mo&s;es Griffith,</HI> and by pre&s;ents from friends.

<HEAD>TO THE HONORABLE DAINES BARRINGTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW execute the promi&s;e I made in town &s;ome time ago, of communicating to you the re&s;ult of my vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>Falk|ener,</HI> an antient je&s;uit, who had pa&s;&s;ed thirty-eight years of his life in the &s;outhern part of <HI>South America,</HI> between the river <HI>la Plata</HI> and the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> Let me endeavor to pre|judice you in favor of my new friend, by a&s;&s;uring you, that by his long intercour&s;e with the inhabitants of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> he &s;eems to have lo&s;t all <HI>European</HI> guile, and to have acquired all the &s;im|plicity, and hone&s;t impetuo&s;ity, of the people he has been &s;o long conver&s;ant with. I venture to give you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for the authenticity of; which con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch facts as he was eye-witne&s;s to, and &s;uch as will (I be|lieve) e&s;tabli&s;h pa&s;t contradiction the veracity of our late circum|navigators,
<PB N="48" REF="56">navigators, and give new lights into the manners of this &s;ingular race of men: it will not, I flatter my&s;elf, be deemed imperti|nent to lay before you a chronological mention of the &s;everal evidences that will tend to prove the exi&s;tence of a people of a &s;upernatural height inhabiting the &s;outhern tract. You will find that the majority of voyagers, who have touched on that coa&s;t, have &s;een them, and made reports of their &s;ize, that will very well keep in countenance the verbal account given by Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and the printed by Mr. <HI>Clarke:</HI> you will ob&s;erve, that if the old voyagers did exaggerate, it was through the novelty and amazement at &s;o &s;ingular a &s;ight; but the latter, forewarned by the preceding accounts, &s;eem to have made their remarks with coolne&s;s, and confirmed them by the experiment of mea&s;ure|ment.</P>
<P>A. D. 1519. The fir&s;t who &s;aw the&s;e people was the great <HI>Magellan;</HI> one of them ju&s;t made his appearance on the banks of the river <HI>la Plata,</HI> and then made his retreat: but during <HI>Magel|lan</HI>'s long &s;tay at <HI>Port St. Julian,</HI> he was vi&s;ited by numbers of this tall race. The fir&s;t approached him, &s;inging, and flinging the du&s;t over his head; and &s;hewed all &s;igns of a mild and peaceable di&s;po&s;ition: his vi&s;age was painted; his garment the &s;kin of &s;ome animal neatly &s;ewed; his arms a &s;tout and thick bow, a quiver of long arrows feathered at one end, and armed at the other with flint. The height of the&s;e people was about &s;even feet, <HI>(French)</HI> but they were not &s;o tall as the per&s;on who approached them fir&s;t, who is repre&s;ented to have been of &s;o gigantic a &s;ize, that <HI>Magellan</HI>'s men did not with their heads reach as high as the wai&s;t of this <HI>Patagonian.</HI> They had with them bea&s;ts of burden, on which they placed their wives; by
<PB N="49" REF="57"><HI>Magellan</HI>'s de&s;cription of them, they appear to have been the animals now known by the name of <HI>Llama.</HI></P>
<P>THESE interviews ended with the captivating two of the people, who were carried away in two different &s;hips; but as &s;oon as they arrived in the hot climate each of them died.</P>
<P>I DWELL the longer on this account, as it appears extremely de&s;erving of credit; as the courage of <HI>Magellan</HI> made him in|capable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence of &s;ear: nor could there be any mi&s;take about the height, as he had not only a long intercour&s;e with them, but the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two, for a very con&s;iderable &s;pace of time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Ramu&s;ios</HI> Coll. Voyages, <HI>Venice</HI> 1550; al&s;o the letter of <HI>Maximilian Tran&s;ylvanus,</HI> Sec. to <HI>Charles</HI> V. and in the 1&s;t vol. p. 376. A. and B.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was <HI>Magellan</HI> who fir&s;t gave them the name of <HI>Patagons,</HI> becau&s;e they wore a &s;ort of &s;lipper made of the &s;kin of animals: <HI>Tellement,</HI> &s;ays <HI>M. de Bro&s;&s;e</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This account (as well as the others where I do not quote my authority) are taken from that judicious writer <HI>M. de Bro&s;&s;e.</HI></NOTE>, quils, <HI>paroi&s;&s;oit avoir des pattes de B&ecirc;tes.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1525, <HI>Garcia de Loui&s;a</HI> &s;aw, within the &s;treights of <HI>Magel|lan,</HI> &s;avages of a very great &s;tature, but he does not particulari&s;e their height.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> the &s;ame &s;treights were pa&s;&s;ed in 1535 by <HI>Simon de Alcazova,</HI> and attempted in 1540, by <HI>Alphon&s;o de Camargo,</HI> but without being vi&s;ited by our tall people.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame happened to our countryman &s;ir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> but, becau&s;e it was not the fortune of that able and popular &s;eaman
<PB N="50" REF="58">to meet with the&s;e gigantic people, his contemporaries con&s;i|dered the report as the invention of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1579, <HI>Pedro Sarmiento</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that tho&s;e he &s;aw were three ells high. This is a writer I would never venture to quote &s;ingly, for he de&s;troys his own credibility by &s;aying, the &s;avage he made pri&s;oner was an errant <HI>Cyclops:</HI> I only cite him to prove that he had fell in with a tall race, though he mixes fable with truth.</P>
<P>IN 1586, our countryman, &s;ir <HI>Thomas Cavendi&s;h,</HI> in his voyage, had only opportunity of mea&s;uring one of their foot&s;teps, which was eighteen inches long: he al&s;o found their graves, and men|tions their cu&s;toms of burying near the &s;hore. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, <HI>i. 58.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>IN 1591, <HI>Anthony Knevet,</HI> who &s;ailed with &s;ir <HI>Thomas Caven|di&s;h</HI> in his &s;econd voyage, relates, that he &s;aw, at <HI>Port De&s;ire,</HI> men fifteen or &s;ixteen &s;pans high, and that he mea&s;ured the bo|dies of two that had been recently buried, which were fourteen &s;pans long. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Purchas, <HI>i. 1232.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>1599.&mdash;<HI>Sebald de Veert,</HI> who &s;ailed with admiral <HI>de Cordes,</HI> was attacked in the &s;treight <HI>Magellan</HI> by &s;avages whom he thought to be ten or eleven feet high: he adds, that they were of reddi&s;h color, and had long hair. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col.

<P>MR. <HI>Falkener</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, that formerly there exi&s;ted a race of <HI>Patagonians</HI> &s;uperior to the&s;e in &s;ize; for &s;keletons are often found of far greater dimen&s;ions, particularly about the river <HI>Texeira.</HI> Perhaps he may have heard of the old tradition of the natives mentioned by, <HI>Cieza</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Seventeen years travels of <HI>Peter de Cieza,</HI> 138.</NOTE> and repeated from him by <HI>Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Tran&s;lated by <HI>Ricaut,</HI> p. 263.</NOTE>, of certain giants having come by &s;ea, and landed near the <HI>Cape of St. Helena,</HI> many ages before the arrival of the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>1618.&mdash;<HI>Gracias de Nodal,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> commander, in the cour&s;e of his voyage, was informed by <HI>John Moore,</HI> one of his crew, who landed between <HI>Cape St. E&s;prit,</HI> and <HI>Cape St. Arenas,</HI> on the &s;outh &s;ide of the &s;treights, that he trafficked with a race of men taller, by the head, than the <HI>Europeans.</HI> This, and the next, are the only in&s;tances I ever met with of the tall race being found on that &s;ide of the &s;treights.</P>
<P>1642.&mdash;<HI>Henry Brewer,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> admiral, ob&s;erved in the &s;treights <HI>le Maire,</HI> the foot&s;teps of men which mea&s;ured eighteen inches, this is the la&s;t evidence in the 17th century of the ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="52" REF="60">of the&s;e tall people: but let it be ob&s;erved, that out of the fifteen fir&s;t voyagers who pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Magellanic</HI> &s;treights, not &s;ewer than nine are undeniable witne&s;&s;es of the fact we would e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent century I can produce but two evidences of the exi&s;tence of the tall <HI>Patagonians.</HI> The one in 1704, when the crew of a &s;hip belonging to <HI>St. Maloes,</HI> commanded by captain <HI>Harrington,</HI> &s;aw &s;even of the&s;e giants in <HI>Gregory</HI> bay.

<P>BUT as it was not the fortune of the four other voyagers, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sir</HI> John Narborough, <HI>in 1670;</HI> Bartholomew Sharp, <HI>in 1680;</HI> De Gennes, <HI>in 1696; and</HI> Beauche&s;ne Gouin, <HI>in 1699.</HI></NOTE> who &s;ailed through the &s;treights in the 17th century, to fall in with any of this tall race, it became a fa&s;hion to treat as fabu|lous the account of the preceding nine, and to hold this lofty race as the mere creation of a warm imagination.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a temper was the public, on the return of Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> from his circumnavigation, in the year 1766. I had not the honor of having per&s;onal conference with that gentleman, therefore will not repeat the accounts I have been informed he had given to &s;everal of his friends; I rather chu&s;e to recapitulate that given by Mr. <HI>Clarke,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This able officer commanded the <HI>Di&s;covery</HI> in captain <HI>Cook</HI>'s la&s;t voyage, and died off <HI>Kamt&s;chatka, Augu&s;t</HI> 22, 1779.</NOTE> in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> for 1767, p. 75. Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> was officer in Mr. <HI>Byron</HI>'s &s;hip, landed with him in the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and had for two
<PB N="53" REF="61">hours an opportunity of &s;tanding within a few yards of this race, and &s;eeing them examined and mea&s;ured by Mr. <HI>Byron.</HI> He re|pre&s;ents them in general as &s;tout and well proportioned, and a&s;&s;ures us, that none of the men were lower than eight feet, and that &s;ome even exceeded nine; and that the women were from &s;even feet and an half to eight feet. He &s;aw Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> mea&s;ure one of the men, and, notwith&s;tanding the commodore was near &s;ix feet high, he could, when on tip-toe, but ju&s;t reach with his hand the top of the <HI>Patagonian</HI>'s head; and Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> is cer|tain, that there were &s;everal taller than him on whom the ex|periment was made, for there were about five hundred men, women, and children. They &s;eemed very happy at the landing of our people, and expre&s;&s;ed their joy by a rude &s;ort of &s;inging. They were of a copper color, and had long lank hair, and faces hideou&s;ly painted; both &s;exes were covered with &s;kins, and &s;ome appeared on hor&s;eback and others on foot.</P>
<P><HI>M. de Premontel</HI> makes this an object of ridicule, as if the &s;ize of the hor&s;es were unequal to the burden of the riders. Our navigators tell us, that the hor&s;es were fifteen or &s;ixteen hands high. It is well known, that a mill-hor&s;e has been known to carry nine hundred and ten pounds, a weight probably beyon that of any <HI>Patagonian</HI> they &s;aw.</P>
<P>A FEW had on their legs a &s;ort of boot, with a &s;harp-pointed &s;tick at the heel in&s;tead of a &s;pur. Their bridles were made of thong, the bit wood; the &s;addle as artle&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, and without &s;tirrups. The introduction of hor&s;es into the&s;e parts by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> introduced likewi&s;e the only &s;pecies of ma|nufacture they appear to be acquainted with. All their &s;kill &s;eems to extend no farther than the&s;e rude e&s;&s;ays at a harne&s;s;
<PB N="54" REF="62">and to equip them&s;elves for <HI>Cavaliers.</HI> In other re&s;pects they would be in the &s;ame &s;tate as our fir&s;t parents ju&s;t turned out of paradi&s;e, cloathed in coats of &s;kins; or at be&s;t in the &s;ame con|dition in which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> found the ancient <HI>Britons;</HI> for their dre&s;s was &s;imilar, their hair long, and their bodies, like tho&s;e of our ance&s;tors, made terrific by wild painting. The&s;e people, by &s;ome means or other, had acquired a few beads and bracelets; otherwi&s;e not a &s;ingle article of <HI>European</HI> fabric appeared among them. The&s;e they mu&s;t have gotten by the intercour&s;e with the other <HI>Indian</HI> tribes: for had they had any intercour&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they never would have neglected procuring knives, the &s;tirrups, and other conveniences which the people &s;een by Mr. <HI>Wallis</HI> had.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have been glad to have clo&s;ed, in this place, the relations of this &s;tupendous race of mankind; becau&s;e the two following accounts given by gentlemen of character and abilities &s;eem to contradict great part of what had been before advanced, or at le&s;t &s;erve to give &s;coffers room to &s;ay, that the preceding navigators had &s;een the&s;e people through the medium of mag|nifying gla&s;&s;es, in&s;tead of the &s;ober eye of ob&s;ervation: but be|fore I make my remarks on what has been before related, I &s;hall proceed with the other navigators, and then attempt to re|concile the different accounts.

That their arms were &s;lings formed of two round balls, fa&s;tened one to each end of a cord, which they fling with great force and dexterity. He adds, they hold one ball in their hand, and &s;wing the other at the full length of the cord round their head, by which it acquires a prodigious velocity: they will fling it to a great di&s;tance, and with &s;uch exactne&s;s, as to &s;trike a very &s;mall object. The&s;e people were al&s;o mounted on hor&s;es; their &s;addles, bridles, &amp;c. were of their own making; &s;ome had iron, and others me|tal bits to their bridles, and one had a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> broad &s;word; but whether the la&s;t articles were taken by war, or procurred by commerce, is uncertain; but the la&s;t is mo&s;t probable. It &s;eems evident that they had intercour&s;e with <HI>Europeans,</HI> and had even adopted &s;ome of their fa&s;hions; for many had cut their dre&s;s into form of <HI>Spani&s;h Punchos,</HI> or a &s;quare piece of cloth with a hole cut for the head, the re&s;t hanging loo&s;e as low as the knees. They al&s;o wore drawers; &s;o the&s;e people had at|tained a few &s;teps farther towards civili&s;ation than their gigan|tic neighbors; others again will appear to have made a far greater advance; for the&s;e &s;till devoured their meat raw, and drank nothing but water.</P>
<P><HI>M. Bougainville,</HI> in the &s;ame year, &s;aw another party of the natives of <HI>Patagonia:</HI> he mea&s;ured &s;everal of them, and declares that none were lower than five feet five inches, <HI>French,</HI> or taller than five feet ten; <HI>i. e.</HI> five feet ten, or &s;ix feet three, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mea&s;ure. He concludes his account with &s;aying, that he after|wards
<PB N="56" REF="64">met with a taller people in the South Sea, but I do not re|collect that he mentions the place.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry to be obliged to remark, in the&s;e voyages, a very illiberal propen&s;ity to cavil at and invalidate the account given by Mr. <HI>Byron:</HI> but at the &s;ame time exult in having had an opportu|nity given me by that gentleman of vindicating his and the national honor. <HI>M. Bougainville,</HI> in order to prove he fell in with the identical people that Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> conver&s;ed with, a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;aw numbers of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of knives of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manu|factory, certainly given them by Mr. <HI>Byron;</HI> but he &s;hould have con&s;idered that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing, that the commerce between <HI>Sheffield</HI> and <HI>South America,</HI> through the port of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> is mo&s;t uncommonly large; and that his <HI>Indians</HI> might have got their knives from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at the &s;ame time that they got their gilt nails and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> harne&s;s: but for farther &s;atisfaction on this &s;ubject, I have liberty to &s;ay, from Mr. <HI>Byron</HI>'s authority, that he never gave a &s;ingle knife to the people he &s;aw; that he had not one at that time about him; that, excepting the pre&s;ents given with his own hands, and the tobacco brought by lieutenant <HI>Cummins,</HI> not the le&s;t trifle was be&s;towed. I am furni&s;hed with one other proof, that the&s;e le&s;&s;er <HI>Indians,</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Wallis</HI> &s;aw, were not the &s;ame with tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> as has been in&s;inuated: for the fir&s;t had with him &s;ome officers who had been with him on the pre|ceding voyage, and who bear witne&s;s, not only to the difference of &s;ize, but declare that the&s;e people had not a &s;ingle article among them given by Mr. <HI>Byron.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Byron</HI>'s letter at the end.</NOTE>. It is extremely probable
<PB N="57" REF="65">that the&s;e were the <HI>Indians</HI> that Mr. <HI>Bougainville</HI> fell in with; for they were furni&s;hed with bits, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;cymeter, and bra&s;s &s;tir|rups as before mentioned.</P>
<P>My la&s;t evidence of the&s;e gigantic <HI>Americans</HI> is that which I received from Mr. <HI>Falkener;</HI> he acquainted me, that about the year 1742 he was &s;ent on a mi&s;&s;ion to the va&s;t plains of <HI>Pampas,</HI> which, if I recollect right, lie to the &s;outh-we&s;t of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and extend near a thou&s;and miles towards the <HI>Andes.</HI> In the&s;e plains he fir&s;t met with &s;ome tribes of the&s;e people, and was taken under the protection of one of the <HI>Caziques.</HI> The remarks he made on their &s;ize were as follows; that the talle&s;t, which he mea&s;ured in the &s;ame manner that Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> did, was &s;even feet eight inches high; that the common height, or middle &s;ize, was &s;ix feet; that there were numbers that were even &s;horter; and that the talle&s;t women did not exceed &s;ix feet. That they were &s;cattered from the foot of the <HI>Andes,</HI> over that va&s;t tract which extends to the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> and are found as far as the <HI>Red River</HI> at <HI>Bay Anagada,</HI> lat. 40. 1; below that the land is too barren to be habitable, and none are found, except accidental migrants, till you arrive at the river <HI>Gallego,</HI> near the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan.</HI></P>
<P>THEY are &s;uppo&s;ed to be a race derived from the <HI>Chilian In|dians,</HI> the <HI>Puelches</HI> who inhabited the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the <HI>Andes,</HI> the &s;ame brave nation who defeated and de&s;troyed the avari|cious <HI>Spaniard Baldivia,</HI> but after that were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;eat.</P>
<P>THEY dwell in large tents covered with the hides of mares, and divided within into apartments, for the different ranks of the family, by a &s;ort of blanketing. They are a mo&s;t migratory
<PB N="58" REF="66">people, and often &s;hift their quarters; when the women &s;trike the tents, a&s;&s;i&s;t in putting them on their hor&s;es, and, like the fe|males of all &s;avage countries, undergo all the laborious work.</P>
<P>THEY have two motives for &s;hifting their quarters; one, for the &s;ake of getting &s;alt, which they find incru&s;ted in the &s;hallow pools near the &s;ea &s;ide.</P>
<P>THE other inducement is the &s;uper&s;tition they have of bury|ing their dead within a certain di&s;tance of the ocean. And I may certainly add a third, that of the nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t lie under of &s;eeking fre&s;h quarters on account of the chace, which is their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>THOSE who deny the exi&s;tence of the&s;e great people, never con&s;ider the migratory nature of the inhabitants of this prodi|gious tract, and never reflect that the tribes who may have been &s;een this month on the coa&s;t, may the next be &s;ome hun|dreds of miles inland, and their place occupied by a tribe or nation totally different. The&s;e gentlemen &s;eem to lay down as a certain po&s;ition, that <HI>Patagonia</HI> is peopled by only a &s;ingle na|tion; and from that fal&s;e principle they draw their arguments, &s;neer, in&s;ult, and even gro&s;sly abu&s;e all that differ in opinion. Among the mo&s;t illiberal of the&s;e writers is <HI>M. de Premontal,</HI> who, with the rapid ingenuity of his country, mounts on his head&s;trong cour&s;er PREJUDICE, &s;ets off full &s;peed, rides over all the hone&s;t fellows that would inform him of his road, and &s;purns even Truth her&s;elf, though &s;he offers to be his guide: but truth is unadorned, and hated by this fanta&s;tic writer; it would &s;poil him of all the flowers of fiction, and tropes of abu&s;e, again&s;t a rival country; and would teach him facts that would ruin his argument,
<PB N="59" REF="67">and reduce his eloquent <HI>memoire</HI> to a &s;ingle narrative of un|conte&s;ted veracity.</P>
<P>THEIR food is (almo&s;t entirely) animal: the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, oxen, guanacoes, and o&s;triches, all of which they eat roa&s;ted or boiled. Their drink is water, except in the &s;ea&s;on when cer|tain &s;pecies of fruit are ripe, for of tho&s;e they make a &s;ort of fermenting liquor called <HI>Chucha,</HI> common to many parts of <HI>South America.</HI> One kind is made of a podded fruit called <HI>Al|garrova,</HI> which &s;mells like a bug, and when brui&s;ed in water becomes an inebriating liquor. The &s;ame fruit is al&s;o eaten as bread. The other <HI>Chucha</HI> is made of the <HI>Molie,</HI> a &s;mall fruit, hot and &s;weet in the mouth: both the&s;e cau&s;e a deep drunken|ne&s;s, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, which excites a phrenetic inebriation, and a wildne&s;s of eyes, which la&s;ts two or three days.</P>
<P>THE cloathing of the&s;e people is either a mantle of &s;kins, or of a woollen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Puelches</HI> have no &s;heep but what they purcha&s;e from the <HI>Voluches,</HI> who inhabit the <HI>Andes,</HI> cultivate &s;heep, and rai&s;e corn; the wool is equally fine with that of <HI>Old Spain.</HI></NOTE> cloth manufactured by them&s;elves; &s;ome is &s;o &s;trong and compact as even to hold water: the color is various, for &s;ome are &s;triped and dyed with the riche&s;t red, made of cochineal and certain roots. They wear a &s;hort apron before, which is tucked between the legs, and pre&s;erves a mode&s;t ap|pearance. They never wear feathered ornaments, except in their dances. Their hair is long, and tied up with a fillet. They have naturally beards <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>M. Premontal</HI> roundly a&s;&s;erts that they have no beards.</NOTE>, but they generally pluck up the hairs; not but &s;ome leave mu&s;taches, as was ob&s;erved by Mr. <HI>Carteret</HI> and <HI>M. Bougainville.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="68">WHEN they go to war, they wear a fourfold coat, of the &s;kin of the <HI>Tapiir,</HI> a cap of bull's hide doubled, and a broad target of the &s;ame. Their offen&s;ive weapons are bows and arrows, the la&s;t headed with bone, lances headed with iron, and broad &s;words, both which they procure from the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> but their native weapons are &s;lings; of the&s;e they have two kinds; one for war, which con&s;i&s;ts of a thong, headed with &s;tone at only one end; and during their campaigns they carry numbers of the&s;e wrapped about their bodies.</P>
<P>THE &s;lings which they u&s;e in the chace of hor&s;es, cattle, or o&s;triches, have a &s;tone fixed to each end; and &s;ometimes another thong, with a third &s;tone, is fa&s;tened to the middle of the other: the&s;e, with amazing dexterity, they fling round the ob|jects of the chace, be they bea&s;ts or o&s;triches, which entangle them &s;o that they cannot &s;tir. The <HI>Indians</HI> leave them, I may &s;ay thus tied neck and heels, and go on in pur&s;uit of fre&s;h game; and, having fini&s;hed their &s;port, return to the animals they left &s;ecured in the &s;lings.</P>
<P>THEIR wars are chiefly with the other <HI>Indians,</HI> for <HI>Patagonia</HI> is inhabited by variety of people, not a &s;ingle nation. They have a great deal of intercour&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and often come down to <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> to trade for iron, bugles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS commerce with the <HI>Europeans</HI> has corrupted them greatly, taught them the vice of dram-drinking, and been a dreadful ob&s;tacle to their moral improvement. Mr. <HI>Falkener</HI> informed me, that he once prevaled on about five hundred to form a reduction, but that they grew unruly and ungovern|able as &s;oon as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> traders got among them.</P>
<P>THEIR war and their chace are carried on on hor&s;eback, for
<PB N="61" REF="69">they are mo&s;t expert riders, and have multitudes of hor&s;es, with which the country is perfectly over-run, for they go in herds of thou&s;ands. The price of a hor&s;e at pre&s;ent is two dollars, or 9s. and 2d. provided it has been broken. About the year 1554 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Garcila&s;&s;e de la Vega, <HI>377,</HI> Engl. <HI>tran&s;lation.</HI></NOTE> near the time of the conque&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> the common price of one was from four to &s;ix thou&s;and to ten thou&s;and <HI>Pe&s;os</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pe&s;os</HI> in the original; perhaps <HI>Pe&s;os duros,</HI> which makes the above &s;um.</NOTE>, or from &pound;.1350 to &pound;.2250 <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>THE venereal di&s;temper is common among them. They do not &s;peak of it as an exotic di&s;order, &s;o probably it is abo|riginal.</P>
<P>IN re&s;pect to religion, they allow two principles, a good and a bad <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>M. de Premontal</HI> is clear they have no &s;ort of religion.</NOTE> The good they call, the Creator of all things; but con&s;ider him as one that, after that, never &s;olicits him&s;elf about them. He is &s;tyled by &s;ome <HI>Soucha,</HI> or chief in the land of &s;trong drink; by others <HI>Gauyara-cunnee,</HI> or Lord of the dead. The evil principle is called <HI>Hueccovoe,</HI> or the wanderer without. Sometimes the&s;e (for there are &s;everal) are &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide over particular per&s;ons, protect their own people, or injure others. The&s;e are likewi&s;e called <HI>Valichu,</HI> or dwellers in the air.</P>
<P>THEY have prie&s;ts and prie&s;te&s;&s;es, who&s;e office is to mediate with the&s;e beings in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s or any di&s;tre&s;s; by the in|tervention of the prie&s;t they are con&s;ulted about future events; at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons the prie&s;t &s;huts him&s;elf up, and falls into a phre|netic
<PB N="62" REF="70">extacy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pretenders to &s;econd &s;ight, in the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> and the <HI>Awenyddion,</HI> or the <HI>In&s;pired,</HI> among the <HI>Welch,</HI> are &s;eized with the &s;ame exta&s;ies.</NOTE> and appears epileptic.

At the&s;e times the great people a&s;&s;emble about the cabin, from whence the oracle is to be delivered, waiting its re|port with great anxiety.</P>
<P>IF a <HI>Cazique</HI> dies, or any public calamity happens; for exam|ple, in particular, when the &s;mall-pox had made great ravages among the tribes, the prie&s;ts are &s;ure to &s;uffer, for the misfor|tune is pre&s;umed to have happened through their neglect in not deprecating the evil; in the&s;e ca&s;es they have no other method of &s;aving them&s;elves, but by laying the blame on others of their brethren.</P>
<P>PRIESTS are cho&s;en from among the young people, the mo&s;t effeminate they can find; but tho&s;e that are epileptic have al|ways the preference, and the&s;e dre&s;s in a female habit.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Puelches</HI> have a notion of a future &s;tate, and imagine that after death they are to be tran&s;ported to a country, where the fruits of inebriation are eternal, there to live in immortal drunk|enne&s;s or the perpetual chace of the o&s;trich.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on of eminence dies, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable wo|man in the place goes into the tent, clears the body of all the inte&s;tines, and &s;crapes off as much of the fle&s;h from the bones as po&s;&s;ible, and then burns very carefully both that and the en|trails: when that is done, the bones are buried till the re&s;t of the fle&s;h is quite decayed; they are taken up within a year;
<PB N="63" REF="71">and if any of the bones drop out of their places they are refixed and tied together, and the whole formed into a perfect &s;keleton. Thus complete, it is packed up in a hide, put on the back of a favorite hor&s;e of the decea&s;ed, and then tran&s;lated to the tomb of his ance&s;tor, perhaps 300 miles di&s;tant, and always within a &s;mall &s;pace from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>THE &s;keleton is then taken out, and, decked in its be&s;t robes, and adorned with plumes and beads, is placed &s;itting in a deep &s;quare pit, parallel with tho&s;e buried before, with &s;word, lance, and other weapons placed by them; and the &s;kins of their hor&s;es, &s;tuffed, and &s;upported by &s;takes, al&s;o accompany them. The top of the pit is then covered with turf, placed on tran&s;ver&s;e beams.</P>
<P>A MATRON is appointed to attend the&s;e &s;epulchres, who&s;e office it is to keep the &s;keletons clean, and to new-clothe them annually <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account agrees with tho&s;e given by <HI>Lafitau</HI> in mo&s;t particulars; vide <HI>Moeurs des Sauvages,</HI> xi. 438.</NOTE> I forgot to add, that, on depo&s;iting a &s;keleton in its tomb, the <HI>Puelches</HI> make a libation of <HI>Chucha,</HI> and, like what I have heard of an hone&s;t <HI>Spaniard,</HI> drink <HI>Viva el morte,</HI> Long live the dead.</P>
<P>THEY allow polygamy, and marry promi&s;cuou&s;ly among other <HI>Americans;</HI> they are allowed as many as three wives apiece, but if any take more than that number, he is e&s;teemed a libertine, and held in very little e&s;teem.</P>
<P>WIDOWS black their faces for a year after their hu&s;bands decea&s;e.</P>
<P>IN re&s;pect to government, the <HI>Caziques</HI> are hereditary, it is
<PB N="64" REF="72">their bu&s;ine&s;s to protect the property of their people, and they have power of life and death: the office is far from being eli|gible; many reject it, becau&s;e they are obliged to pay all their people for their &s;ervices, who may at plea&s;ure change their <HI>Caziques,</HI> &s;o that &s;everal refu&s;e to accept new va&s;&s;als, who may offer them&s;elves; for it is not allowed any <HI>Indian</HI> to live out of the protection of &s;ome <HI>Cazique:</HI> in &s;uch a ca&s;e he would cer|tainly be looked on as an outlaw.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE is in high e&s;teem with them. If a <HI>Cazique</HI> wants that talent, he keeps an orator; ju&s;t as leaders in oppo&s;ition have been known to do among us.</P>
<P>THIS clo&s;es the hi&s;tory Mr. <HI>Falkener</HI> favored me with; but I mu&s;t not quit that gentleman without informing you, that he returned to <HI>Europe</HI> with a &s;uit of <HI>Patagonian</HI> cloth, a cup of horn, and a little pot made of <HI>Chilian</HI> copper; the whole fruits the <HI>Spaniards</HI> left him, after the labors of a thirty-eight years mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>FROM the preceding account it appears, that the country, which goes under the name of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> extending from the river <HI>la Plata,</HI> lat. 35, to the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> lat. 53 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>M. de Premontal</HI> will compare <HI>Patagonia</HI> to the &s;pace between the <HI>Rivicre des Sardines</HI> and the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan.</HI></NOTE>, and we&s;tward as far as the <HI>Andes,</HI> is inhabited by men who may be divided into three different cla&s;&s;es; and to them may be added a fourth, a combination or mixture of others.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is a race of men of common &s;ize, who have been &s;een by numbers, and who&s;e exi&s;tence is indi&s;putable. The&s;e often are &s;een on the northern &s;ide of the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="73">and oftener on the <HI>Terra del Fuego</HI> &s;ide, even as low as oppo&s;ite to <HI>Cape Horn.</HI> The&s;e are frequently an exiled race, unhappy fugitives, drove by their enemies to take &s;helter from their fury, in tho&s;e di&s;tant parts; for &s;uch is the information Mr. <HI>Falkener</HI> received from &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> he met with in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> and this will account for the &s;ettled melancholy of the people ob&s;erved by the navigators in <HI>Terra del Fuego.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;econd cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who (in general) exceed the common height of <HI>Europeans</HI> by a few inches, or perhaps the head; &s;uch were tho&s;e who were &s;een by <HI>John Moore,</HI> who &s;ailed with <HI>Gracias de Nodal,</HI> in 1618; by Mr. <HI>Carteret,</HI> in 1767, and by <HI>M. Bougainville,</HI> in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>THE third cla&s;s is compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who&s;e height is &s;o extra|ordinary as to occa&s;ion &s;o great a di&s;belief of the accounts of voyagers; and yet they are indi&s;putably an exi&s;tent people; they have been &s;een by <HI>Magellan,</HI> and &s;ix others, in the 16th century, and by two if not three in the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE fourth cla&s;s is a mixed race, who, carele&s;s about pre|&s;erving their generous and exalted breed pure and undegenerate, have degraded them&s;elves by intermixing with the puny tribes of the country, and from that intercour&s;e have produced a mon|grel breed of every &s;ize, except that of the original &s;tandard; &s;ome few, as if by accident, &s;eem to a&s;pire to the height of their ance&s;tors, but are checked in their growth, and &s;top at the &s;ta|ture of &s;even feet eight inches, &s;carce the middle &s;ize of the ge|nuine breed. But another rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned for the dege|neracy and inequality of &s;ize in this cla&s;s: they live within the neighborhood of <HI>Europeans,</HI> they have intercour&s;e with them, and from them they have acquired the vice of dram-drinking,
<PB N="66" REF="74">and all its horrible con&s;equences; this alone is &s;ufficient to make a nation of giants dwindle into pygmies.</P>
<P>A THIRD rea&s;on may &s;till be a&s;&s;igned, viz. the introduc|tion of manufactories among them. Tho&s;e people, who de|pended on the &s;poils of the chace for their habiliments, were certain of pre&s;erving their full vigor, their &s;trength of con&s;titu|tion, and fulne&s;s of habit; while tho&s;e who are confined to the loom grow enervate, and lo&s;e much of the force of their bodily faculties. They al&s;o live in tents lined with woollen manu|facture, which doubtle&s;sly are much more delicate, luxurious, and warm, than the dwellings of the third undegenerate cla&s;s. We are unacquainted with the form of their tents, but we know that they &s;till cloath them&s;elves with the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and that, among tho&s;e Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> &s;aw, there was not the le&s;t appear|ance of manufactury, excepting what related to their hor&s;e fur|niture. The&s;e &s;eem to have been the genuine remains of the free race; the conquerors of <HI>Pedro de Baldivia;</HI> the <HI>Puelches,</HI> who&s;e original &s;tation was among the <HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Chiloe,</HI> in about latitude 43, and almo&s;t due ea&s;t of the i&s;le of <HI>Chiloe.</HI> The&s;e were the de&s;cendants of the <HI>Indians</HI> who retreated to the &s;outh, far out of the common track of <HI>Europeans,</HI> and who retain their primeval grandeur of &s;ize; the others, who fled north-ea&s;t, for|getful of their original magnificent &s;tature, lo&s;t in general that noble di&s;tinction by un&s;uitable alliances, and the u&s;e of &s;pirits, while the fir&s;t probably only marry among them&s;elves, and cer|tainly have all &s;trong liquor in abhorrence: &s;ome of this tall race &s;eem &s;till to inhabit the &s;tations of their ance&s;tors, or &s;ome not very remote from them; for <HI>M.

<Q><P>THE people I &s;aw, upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> were not the &s;ame that was &s;een the &s;econd voyage.

<HEAD>FREE THOUGHTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a time in which you feel the di&s;tre&s;&s;es in common with the re&s;t of the nation, it behoves every one of you to be made acquainted with the laws, in order (as much as is po&s;&s;ible) to ea&s;e your&s;elves of the burdens under which you labor, and legally to re&s;i&s;t every oppre&s;&s;ion which may be attempted again&s;t you.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t grievous load which you now feel (next to the poor's rate) is that which ari&s;es from the taxes to &s;upport the militia. The laws relating to it are the mo&s;t numerous, and the puni&s;hments attending the breach of them are &s;o hard, that for fear that any of you &s;hould offend, by rea&s;on of ignorance, I &s;hall, in the briefe&s;t manner, &s;et before you a few points which concern per&s;ons in every &s;tation of life. If I &s;hould chance to &s;peak of any piece of hi&s;tory, or touch on any thing beyond the apprehen&s;ions of any of you, your mini&s;ter is, I tru&s;t, re&s;ident among you, and ready to expound any diffi|culty.</P>
<P>THE militia has been of very long &s;tanding in this kingdom; &s;everal &s;tatutes were from very old times enacted for its regula|tion, which in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. were revi&s;ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">13, 14 Ch. II. c. 3. Stat. L. iii. 219. Dige&s;t 1.</NOTE> and a new body of laws framed. The&s;e were continued almo&s;t to the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty; <NOTE PLACE="marg">30 G. II. c. 25. Stat. L. viii. 80.</NOTE> for after they had undergone &s;eve|ral alterations in the latter part of his grandfather's time, they
<PB N="74" REF="81">were totally repealed, and the laws under which we now act were made in their place; but many of the clau&s;es of the pre|ceding &s;tatute were re&s;tored. The former is called the <HI>Old Militia.</HI> It certainly was of very little u&s;e as it then &s;tood; but it had one advantage over the pre&s;ent; <NOTE PLACE="marg">13, 14 Ch. II. L. iii. &s;. 3.</NOTE> for the expence of rai&s;ing the men was founded on the true&s;t ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e who had great e&s;tates, palaces, and rich furniture to defend, were charged accordingly. The gentlemen of le&s;&s;er fortune, and free|holders, were charged le&s;s; and the hone&s;t farmer, who had nothing but his rick-yard, the hard fruit of his labor! his poor dwelling, and his coar&s;e bed, to care about, was only obliged to pay according to &s;uch private agreement as might be made between him and his landlord; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame, &s;. 29. Dige&s;t, p. 8.</NOTE> and all this was done in the ar|bitrary reign of a <HI>Stuart!</HI> But at pre&s;ent there is, in one in|&s;tance, a more levelling principle. The poor laborer is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. &s;. 42. Stat. L. viii. 622. Dige&s;t 6.</NOTE> obliged to contribute ten pounds (if he can rai&s;e it) towards the defence of the kingdom; and the greate&s;t &s;quire in the principality is not bound to give a farthing more.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Old Militia,</HI> all bu&s;ine&s;s relating to the charging the &s;ubject with finding &s;oldiers, was committed to the lieutenant of the county and his deputies, or to the major part of tho&s;e pre&s;ent; <NOTE PLACE="marg">13, 14 Ch. II. c. 3. &s;. 3. Stat. L. iii. 219. Dige&s;t 3.</NOTE> or, in the ab&s;ence of the lieutenant, to the major part of the deputy lieutenants then pre&s;ent; which major part was to be <HI>three at le&s;t.</HI> I am &s;orry to remark, that even at the fir&s;t framing of the new militia, this important &s;ecurity of the in|tere&s;ts of the poor &s;ubject was weakened: <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. &s;. 58. Stat. L. viii. 624.</NOTE> for the powers were in that act entru&s;ted to three deputy lieutenants or ju&s;tices only; and &s;ince that time, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 G. III. c. 59. &s;. 11. Stat. L. xiii. 288. Dige&s;t 47.</NOTE> the number (when the militia is in actual &s;ervice) is reduced to two only.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="82">THIS has been a mo&s;t dangerous and imprudent alteration. Every one knows the hazard of tru&s;ting power in few hands. Friend&s;hip, relation&s;hip, or an unfortunate congenial turn of mind, may be found in two, which will hardly be met with in a greater number. In fact, two may become but as one, and this reduction be productive of the mo&s;t &s;hameful abu&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT if it were po&s;&s;ible, that a gentleman &s;hould &s;o far forget the duty he owes to his country, as to adopt a &s;y&s;tem, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant view productive of a military government; &s;hould he, through mi&s;taken friend&s;hip, promote or &s;econd any illega|lity of proceeding; Heaven have mercy upon poor <HI>Britain!</HI> Not the increa&s;ing power of the crown; not the machinations of a faction; not the corruption of a parlement, will half &s;o effec|tually ruin its con&s;titution. Not the force of man can overturn it, if the civil powers are true to their tru&s;t: nor le&s;s than the intervention of Heaven pre&s;erve it, if they are fal&s;e.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent perhaps no danger is to be apprehended; but, for the &s;ake of po&s;terity, let us guard again&s;t events; and remember, that <Q>an attack by &s;torm may be repul&s;ed, but an un&s;u&s;pected &s;ap is &s;ure in the end to overturn the &s;tronge&s;t works.</Q></P>
<P>Is the militia at pre&s;ent that pure a&s;&s;emblage of men of rank, fortune, and independence, as it was in the beginning? It may con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons of equal integrity. But is it not po&s;&s;ible that a few may have crept in, de&s;titute of qualification, or de&s;titute of heads &s;teady enough to bear the great trial of power? Are there no in&s;tances of their carrying the controul of the camp into pri|vate life; none, of their ruffling the tranquillity of the &s;ocial hour, clouding the bright moments of the gay a&s;&s;embly; or pre|
<PB N="76" REF="83">venting the impending nap of the quiet magi&s;trate, who dared to differ in opinion with them?</P>
<P>I SHALL make no remarks on the method of ballotting, except this: that a power is given to the deputy lieutenants and ju&s;|tices to order a fre&s;h ballot, in ca&s;e the lot falls on any per&s;on who, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 G. III. c. 14 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abridged, and part of the clau&s;e omitted, in Mr. <HI>Ruf&s;head</HI>'s edition. See vol. xiii. 181.</NOTE>. Dige&s;t, ed. 1778. p. 52.</NOTE> by rea&s;on of infirmity, or want of &s;ize, is unfit to &s;erve. This is extremely ju&s;t: yet &s;trict attention &s;hould be paid to this power; lea&s;t through too great nicety in the gentlemen, or too great favor to the commanding officer, they &s;hould be in|duced to reject tho&s;e to whom nothing but the mo&s;t trivial, or perhaps affected objections could be made. Be&s;ides, it mo&s;t commonly happens, that on the day of appeal the li&s;ts are en|tirely cleared from all objectionable per&s;ons. For the &s;ake of the people therefore, a &s;evere penalty &s;hould be enacted, as a guard again&s;t the abu&s;e of this power.</P>
<P>IF any of you who are ballotted, do not chu&s;e to &s;erve, you have liberty of offering a &s;ub&s;titute; and that &s;ub&s;titute mu&s;t be five feet four inches high, and fit for &s;ervice. You mu&s;t offer none but &s;uch who are active in body and &s;ound in mind: who can fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they are called out, that of defending our wives, children, and property. You mu&s;t offer &s;uch who will not &s;hame you in di&s;tant counties, or give needle&s;s trouble to the gentlemen who command them, and who have, in many in&s;tances, for all our &s;akes, given up for a time every comfort of a dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="84">IF you happen to be &s;ix feet high, and formed as perfect as man can be, the magi&s;trates ought not to refu&s;e a &s;ub&s;titute in|ferior to you in tho&s;e advantages; it may be your good (or I may &s;ay in this ca&s;e) your ill fortune to be &s;o made: but &s;till they ought not to refu&s;e any one you offer, who comes within the above de&s;cription. Two deputy lieutenants, or one deputy lieutenant and one ju&s;tice, have power to accept or refu&s;e them. If the&s;e two are re&s;olved to plague you, by the refu&s;al of proper &s;ub&s;titutes, look about the room, and &s;ee if there are any others pre&s;ent, and p&eacute;rhaps by their interference the former may be &s;hamed into compliance; for there are none but have eyes as well as they, to di&s;cern whether a man is five feet four, and proper to be accepted; and &s;en&s;e enough to know (in ca&s;es where a &s;ub&s;titute is accepted) that a &s;ingle man will be le&s;s burden&s;ome to a pari&s;h than a married man. A merciful ma|gi&s;trate will &s;urely never he&s;itate to prefer the former?</P>
<P>THE po&s;&s;ible abu&s;e of the power of rejection, or acceptance of &s;ub&s;titutes, when lodged in two only, &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;uming the antient mode, and of enlarging the number. At pre&s;ent, let the power be ever &s;o much abu&s;ed, you are left help|le&s;s in this act, for there is no puni&s;hment for tho&s;e who make &s;o wanton an exertion of it.</P>
<P>BUT remember, that in ca&s;e you are at length teized, by the refu&s;al of &s;everal &s;tout &s;ub&s;titutes, into the payment of ten pounds (which, properly &s;peaking, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 42. Stat. L. viii. 622.</NOTE> is only to be levied in ca&s;e you refu&s;e or neglect to provide a man in your room) remember, I &s;ay, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. s;. 51. Stat. L. viii. 624. Dige&s;t 57.</NOTE> that you are to pay the money into the hands of the church-wardens and over&s;eers of your re&s;pective pari&s;hes only, who are al&s;o the only per&s;ons appointed by law to receive and pay the
<PB N="78" REF="85">ten pounds, or to agree or contract for any &s;ub&s;titutes, unle&s;s you &s;hould chu&s;e to do it your&s;elves, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 52. Dige&s;t 58.</NOTE> or &s;hould chu&s;e to employ any friend to do it for you.</P>
<P>AND ob&s;erve, that in ca&s;e any of the deputies or ju&s;tices, or even the lord lieutenant him&s;elf, &s;hould offend in any article of the above clau&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 51. Stat. L. viii. 624. Dige&s;t 57, 58.</NOTE> you may lay an information again&s;t him, and he is liable to be fined <HI>one hundred pounds:</HI> half of which is to be paid to the pro&s;ecutor, and half to the poor of the pari&s;h in which the offence was committed; and you may recover it in any of his maje&s;ty's courts of record.</P>
<P>IF any deputy or ju&s;tice demands and gets from you more than ten pounds, the offence becomes the dirty crime of extor|tion. Will not the world &s;ay, that the offender &s;inks the cha|racter of the generous <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> gentleman, or brave officer, into that of the recruiting &s;erjeant; and that he forfeits the confidence of his poor countrymen, who look up to him for protection from every wrong? But you may have more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ati&s;|faction; you may bring an action again&s;t him, expo&s;e him in a court of ju&s;tice, and recover full damages. This may atone for the private injury: but the public wrong is of that moment, as only to be expiated before one of our highe&s;t tribunals; and with all the &s;olemnity of public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THERE is not one of your fellow-&s;ubjects, let him be ever &s;o great, that can levy on you a farthing more than the law allows. One of our kings lo&s;t his head for trying to rai&s;e money without con&s;ent of parlement. Surely you have more &s;pirit than to &s;uffer any private man to tax you of his own authority? At the &s;ame time you mu&s;t pay quietly the ten pounds penalty; but only in ca&s;e you have by law incurred it. But remember, that
<PB N="79" REF="86">this payment does not exempt you from &s;erving again at the end of the three years, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 42. Stat. L. viii. 622.</NOTE> or from providing a &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>THE militia is our great and con&s;titutional &s;ecurity: it is the intere&s;t of us all to pre&s;erve this bulwark of our freedom; but let us all take care that, what was &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly intended to be the guardian of our liberties, become not the in&s;trument of our &s;lavery, in the hands of men who know not the true u&s;e of power.</P>
<P>IF it was po&s;&s;ible that any deputy or ju&s;tice &s;hould refu&s;e your &s;ub&s;titutes, and immediately after take tho&s;e very men in the room of other ballotted people, let his &s;hame be his puni&s;h|ment, for I fear that the act provides none. But as the preci&s;e de&s;cription of fit or unfit is quite un&s;ettled, you will, in &s;uch an in&s;tance, have the comfort of being a&s;&s;ured by the very magi|&s;trates them&s;elves, that you never wi&s;hed to affront them by the offer of in&s;ufficient people.</P>
<P>IF a poor man is made de&s;perate by the rejection of &s;everal fit &s;ub&s;titutes, and by the inability of paying the ten pounds, and afterwards ab&s;conds, he is liable to a more &s;evere puni&s;h|ment: how far it may exceed the offence, I &s;ubmit to public judgment. At fir&s;t the law provided one which &s;eemed equal to the fault, which was a fine of ten pounds, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 42, 128. Stat. L. viii. 621, 637.</NOTE> or for want of di&s;tre&s;s, impri&s;onment in the common jail, there to live for three months among felons, and &s;tarve; for I &s;u&s;pect that he is in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than them, not being comprehended within the king's or county allowance, which the vile&s;t of felons are en|titled to.</P>
<P>THIS clau&s;e was repealed, and the unhappy wretch is, in time of actual &s;ervice, liable to be &s;eized, his name entered on the
<PB N="80" REF="87">roll, be delivered to an officer of the corps he was ballotted for, torn from his family, hand-cuffed, and marched perhaps two hundred miles acro&s;s the country; <NOTE PLACE="marg">19 G. III. c. 72. &s;. 22. Stat. L. xiii. 485, Dige&s;t 62.</NOTE> then to &s;erve three years un|der perhaps an irritated commander: and &s;hould he again ab|&s;cond, be liable to the infamy of whipping, or to be &s;hot like the mo&s;t profligate de&s;erter. In the name of Heaven! let this clau&s;e be for ever blotted from our &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>THIS merits the more attention, becau&s;e nothing is ea&s;ier to a mercile&s;s magi&s;trate, than to bring a man within this clau&s;e. A poor creature may be able to rai&s;e &s;ix or &s;even pounds to give to the &s;ub&s;titute whom he has engaged, and yet, with all his endeavours, not be able to rai&s;e ten pounds. The magi|&s;trates refu&s;e his &s;ub&s;titutes, and finding neither money or effects to the value of ten pounds, in&s;tantly convict him of the crime of poverty, and he &s;uffers accordingly. Or, he may not be a hou&s;eholder, yet be able to pay the ten pounds; but through indignation at the treatment he has received, by the rejection of his &s;ub&s;titutes, refu&s;es to depo&s;it the money, and having no effects, is in like manner &s;ubject to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;e any militia man is di&s;approved by the commanding officer, <NOTE PLACE="marg">19 G. III. c. 72. &s;. 23. Stat. L. xiii. 485. Dige&s;t 55, 56.</NOTE> after being enrolled, it is lawful for the officer to di&s;|charge him; but he mu&s;t give his rea&s;ons in writing, and be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two deputy lieutenants: &s;o attentive, in this in&s;tance, have our law-givers been to the prevention of abu&s;e in the mili|tary power! Why have they been &s;o remi&s;s in the former far more important matter?</P>
<P>PLEASE to ob&s;erve, that throughout the militia act, the com|manding officer is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the civil power, or the
<PB N="81" REF="88">deputy lieutenants and ju&s;tices of the peace. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 28. Stat. L. viii. 618. Dige&s;t 36.</NOTE> The lord lieu|tenant alone is permitted to act as colonel: he alone is per|mitted to unite the civil and military characters, becau&s;e he can delegate his powers &s;o that his ab&s;ence may be di&s;pen&s;ed with. In every other in&s;tance, they are &s;o very carefully &s;eparated, as never to appear acting together; except in the in&s;tance of the di&s;charge of a man, in which they have a &s;hort corre&s;pondence. The law plainly de&s;igns, that no per&s;on inferior to the lord lieu|tenant, &s;hould act in both capacities; much le&s;s to pre&s;ide at the meetings, and brow-beat the deputy lieutenants or ju&s;tices in the di&s;charge of their duty. <Q>A prince, therefore, never &s;hould give to military men a civil employment: on the contrary, they ought to be checked by the civil magi&s;trate, that the &s;ame per&s;ons may not have the confidence of the people, and the power to abu&s;e it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE civil power is the &s;oul which is to animate the military machine, and put it in motion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 95. Stat. L. xiii. 631. Dige&s;t 72.</NOTE> The civil power forms the men into regiments, or in &s;mall counties into companies; a&s;|&s;embles men in convenient &s;tations, and even po&s;ts to each company its proper officers.</P>
<P>THE time of training and exerci&s;ing the men, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 99. Stat. L. viii. 632. Dige&s;t 74.</NOTE> and the place of rendezvous, is al&s;o entirely in the power of the lieutenant and two deputies; or, in the ab&s;ence of the lieutenant, in that of three deputy lieutenants: <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G.

<P><PB N="82" REF="89">IN a few words; it does not appear that the commanding officer has &s;carcely any part to perform till he takes the field: the ballotting, the approving, and the rejecting of volunteers or &s;ub&s;titutes, re&s;ting entirely in the civil magi&s;trates. The power of the commandant does not commence till, at &s;oone&s;t, the time of enrolling; for within a month after that, he is at liberty to correct the choice of the deputy lieutenants, and to di&s;charge any man whom they have &s;uffered to pa&s;s mu&s;ter, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G.

<P>GOOD manners, and even prudence, &s;hould induce the magi|&s;trates to invite any di&s;creet officer of the corps to attend the meeting for accepting of &s;ub&s;titutes: or, if the corps is too re|mote, prudence &s;hould urge them to do the &s;ame to any fit offi|cer of a neighboring corps, be it regular or militia. They ought not; they cannot be partakers of the power entru&s;ted to the civil magi&s;trates: but they may be u&s;efully con&s;ulted on any ca&s;es of acceptance, in which the magi&s;trates may have doubts. Every officer is equally a citizen of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and I dare to &s;ay, on this occa&s;ion would, in his advice, not forget that mo&s;t important character.</P>
<P>THE power given to the commandant, of di&s;charging any man he di&s;likes in one month after enrolling, &s;hews, that it is not &s;uppo&s;ed he could be pre&s;ent at the ballot, or could have any concern in approving of the &s;ub&s;titutes; otherwi&s;e, he could not po&s;&s;ibly receive improper men one week, in order to di&s;|charge them the next.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 128. Stat. L. viii. 637. Dige&s;t 61.</NOTE> I SHALL clo&s;e this &s;u&s;picion of the probability of the com|manding officer's being excluded from all concern in the rai&s;ing
<PB N="83" REF="90">of the militia, with this remark, that the overplus of the penalty of ten pounds, if any remains, is to be paid by the deputy lieu|tenants and ju&s;tices to the clerk of the regiment or battalion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the by, an omi&s;&s;ion in the Dige&s;t.</NOTE>, who is to account for it to the colonel or commanding officer; a direction which &s;ufficiently points out the difference of cha|racter and di&s;tinction of the department.</P>
<P>MANY of you, in order to ea&s;e your&s;elves of expence, have formed clubs, in which every per&s;on liable to be ballotted &s;ub|&s;cribed a &s;mall &s;um, and rai&s;ed &s;ufficient to find a &s;ub&s;titute, in ca&s;e the lot fell on any one of the members. By this means you prevented a heavy load from falling on all &s;uch, who by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, or any other infirmity, were excepted from &s;erving; but not from the taxes attendant on the militia. This you did freely: and in ca&s;e the lot fell upon any one of you who cho&s;e to &s;erve, you made u&s;e of the club-money, and &s;corned to put your poor neighbors (for whom you were going to fight) to any more expence than the &s;upport of your families.</P>
<P>THE law, by a very particular clau&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 53. Stat. L. viii. 624. Dige&s;t 58.</NOTE> encourages the u&s;e of the&s;e clubs, and as it were, renders optional the u&s;e of a fore|going clau&s;e; and prevents it from being made burden&s;ome to any pari&s;hes, except tho&s;e which have been imprudent enough not to form the&s;e clubs, in ea&s;e to them&s;elves. But to levy the tax of half the price of a volunteer, as that clau&s;e directs, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 47. 19 G. III. c. 72. Dige&s;t 101. Stat. L. viii. 623. xiii. 483.</NOTE> is a mere wanton exertion of power, in all places where clubs have been e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="91">HALF the price of a volunteer has been generally fixed at four guineas, or four and a half: yet I have known, in the very week in which ten or twelve guineas have been prodigally be|&s;towed on a &s;ub&s;titute, men equally good have been inli&s;ted in the regulars for four; and within five weeks after enrolling, a militia &s;ub&s;titute to &s;upply a vacancy has been got by one of the pari&s;hes for four only.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;e half the price of a volunteer is to be rai&s;ed on the country, you have an indulgence of deferring the payment one whole month. Among other rea&s;ons, is this; it gives time to the over&s;eers of the poor, who are charged with the payment, to collect the money from their poor brethren, it being well known that many who are thus taxed are wor&s;e off than tho&s;e for who&s;e u&s;e the money is rai&s;ed. Perhaps almo&s;t the whole month may be required for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed tenant to get in a little money, notwith&s;tanding all the trouble and ill-will the over&s;eer has in di&s;charge of his office.</P>
<P>BUT our law-makers had another rea&s;on for giving you a month's time for the payment; becau&s;e (as I &s;aid before) the commanding officer has power to di&s;charge any man he di&s;|likes within one month after enrolling, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame, Sect. 48 in one, 14 in the o|ther.</NOTE> and then no &s;uch money is to be paid to that per&s;on, but to the next cho&s;en by lot in his &s;tead. Now it may happen, that if you pay it to the fir&s;t per|&s;on on, or &s;oon after the day of enrolling, he may die within the month, or he may be di&s;charged, and in the la&s;t ca&s;e mo&s;t pro|bably may have &s;pent the money; in &s;o much that the pari&s;h mu&s;t pay the &s;ame &s;um over again to the next per&s;on, who is as liable to be di&s;charged within a day or two, as the other, and the pari&s;h
<PB N="85" REF="92">put, without remedy, to fre&s;h expences. Never, therefore, pay the money till the end of the month, and you will be on the &s;ure &s;ide, and within the meaning of the law.</P>
<P>YOU need not fear being put to the expence of maintaining the wives or children of the &s;erjeants. In one of your counties, two well-meaning magi&s;trates made the trial, but when their order came to the clerk of the peace, who is a very hone&s;t fel|low, he took it, and the matter was totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 114. Dige&s;t 84. St. L. viii. 634. 2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 38. Dige&s;t 38. Stat. L. viii. 619. 2 G. III. c. 20. &s;. 39. Dige&s;t 39.</NOTE> One &s;hould have thought it impo&s;&s;ible that they could mi&s;take a non|commi&s;&s;ion officer for a common man, or not have read, that &s;erjeants were appointed from among the common men, and were, on any mi&s;conduct, liable to be reduced to the rank of common men.</P>
<P>THE above is the only per&s;onal allu&s;ion in this little piece: but I hope I may make free with my&s;elf, and thus with &s;hame and contrition perform my <HI>amende honorable.</HI></P>
<P>IF any of you are oppre&s;&s;ed in any manner what&s;oever, do not de&s;pair of relief. Remember you live in a free country, where ju&s;tice is open to the poor as well as the rich. It is not many years ago &s;ince a great lord, a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, made the &s;ame mi&s;take as mo&s;t country ju&s;tices have done, and i&s;&s;ued a general warrant again&s;t a private gentleman; who had &s;pirit to take the law of his lord&s;hip, and recovered four thou|&s;and pounds damage. And I remember a cobler near <HI>London,</HI> who went to law with a former king for a foot-path, and ca&s;t his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>BUT let the law be your la&s;t re&s;ource. I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of &s;etting you and the gentry at variance. They
<PB N="86" REF="93">are bound to give you protection by the duties of humanity: by their duty as magi&s;trates. They are bound by their oaths <Q><HI>to do equal ju&s;tice to the poor and to the rich, after their cunning wit and power, and after the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm, and the &s;tatutes thereof made.</HI></Q> You are bound to pay to them a manly re&s;pect; for on their integrity, knowlege, and power, YOUR OWN SAFETY DEPENDS. <HI>In our &s;everal &s;tations we are</HI> ALL BOUND TO BE PROTECTIONS <HI>one to the other.</HI> If any of them, through heat, or forgetfulne&s;s of the law, &s;hould have injured you, apply for redre&s;s in a private manner. I tru&s;t that there are in every <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> county &s;ome worthy gentlemen who will undertake your cau&s;e, and perform the ble&s;&s;ed office of peace|makers. Tho&s;e who may have wronged you, need not be a&s;hamed of making the poore&s;t of you amends. Reparation of an injury does honor to the offender, and wipes away the offence. The greate&s;t man in <HI>England</HI> may glory in the opportunity.</P>
<P>IN di&s;tracted times, &s;uch as the pre&s;ent, petty tyrants are apt to ari&s;e, who think they can act &s;ecure in the rage of the &s;torm, The watchman is not to be blamed who, in &s;u&s;picious &s;ea&s;ons, gives the alarm on the &s;ight of the ri&s;ing of a di&s;tant du&s;t. I hope, therefore, it will not be thought pre&s;umptuous in me, unbidden, to take the office. Internal impul&s;es to prevent evils, ought not to be re&s;i&s;ted. I am not a fir&s;t-rate man among you: but a pygmy armed by ju&s;tice goes forth a giant. Within the county in which I am de&s;tined to act, I am in a particular manner bound to befriend you; to befriend you in a good cau&s;e: but if you are wrong, and ob&s;tinately wrong, my utmo&s;t endea|vours &s;hall be u&s;ed to inflict on you every puni&s;hment in the power of the law.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="94">BUT I hope that peace and mutual confidence will ever reign among us; and that rich and poor will, as is their joint intere&s;t, endeavour to promote, to the utmo&s;t of their abilities, RESPECT TO THE LAWS, AND RESPECT TO TRUE LIBERTY. Such,</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A <HI>WELSH FREEHOLDER</HI> TO HIS REPRESENTATIVE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE><HI>February</HI> 10, 1784.</DATE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM obliged to you for your favor of <HI>January</HI> 24th, and &s;hould have been extremely happy to have received an an&s;wer a little more &s;atisfactory. I am mo&s;t willing to believe that your de|&s;igns may at this time be pure, that you have no thought to eradicate monarchy, no more than hundreds of great characters had in the beginning of the troubles of the la&s;t century, but by the artifices of the popular leaders, they were drawn from vio|lence to violence, till their retreat became impracticable; and when they made the attempt, they were overwhelmed by the ty|ranny which they unwittingly had helped to e&s;tabli&s;h, and
<PB N="92" REF="98">which &s;oon after totally &s;ubverted the con&s;titution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fimilar in&s;tance unhappily may be given in our times, when numbers of the fir&s;t national a&s;&s;embly of <HI>France</HI> have been ma&s;&s;acred by the very people they labored to free from one of the wor&s;t of governments!</NOTE>. You &s;eem &s;hocked at the idea, and are ready to &s;ay with <HI>Hazael,</HI> "Is thy &s;er|vant a dog, that he &s;hould do the&s;e things?" What is the govern|ment of our kingdom, but the wi&s;e mixture of King, Lords, and Commons, each one de&s;igned to be a check on the ill-conduct of the others: if you de&s;troy the powers of any one, and the others &s;hould unite, you e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, for you take away the &s;alutary control of the third. Your &s;aying that the pre&s;ent majority is not anti-monarchial is &s;aying nothing; for if you deprive the King of the power of chu&s;ing his own &s;ervants, or of the other great executive privilege of appointing to places, you make him merely nominal; an arrant King Log.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e two months the above has been (as yet happily) in vain attempted; fir&s;t in the endeavour to place in the Com|mons the di&s;po&s;ition of places in <HI>India</HI> and all its va&s;t depen|dencies; &s;econdly, in the interference of Lord ****, in the di&s;po|&s;al of the dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> thirdly, in the pre&s;ent attempt to wre&s;t from Maje&s;ty the undoubted right of chu&s;ing his own mi|ni&s;ters: let the&s;e points be gained by the Commons, and mo|narchy falls. Have your leaders informed you what govern|ment they mean to e&s;tabli&s;h? If prerogative is de&s;troyed, this cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for I think the King will never &s;ubmit to be brought from his pri&s;on at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, with the pageantry of maje&s;ty, to give his a&s;&s;ent to acts &s;ignified by the plea&s;ure of the Commons. I tru&s;t that we both look with equal horror on a
<PB N="93" REF="99">King without Commons, as Commons without King. The pernicious re&s;olutions of <HI>January</HI> the twelfth are without prece|dent, becau&s;e unprovoked; the cau&s;e ought to have been of the fir&s;t magnitude to have produced &s;uch effects, which involve all ranks in their de&s;tructive con&s;equence. They are like a &s;word which pa&s;&s;es undi&s;tingui&s;hed between innocent and guilty. Your con&s;tituents feel their &s;hare. All bu&s;ine&s;s is ob&s;tructed, and po&s;|&s;ibly in a few days the whole army is to be let loo&s;e on their fel|low &s;ubjects. What crime has maje&s;ty or mini&s;ters committed, to bring on them and our country &s;uch calamities? Has not year after year the King quietly a&s;&s;ented to every bill pa&s;&s;ed by the two other branches of legi&s;lature for the weakening of his own power? Had he had ill de&s;igns, his own prerogative might have checked the abridgement of his authority. I in&s;tance only the act for taking away the vote of revenue officers, and that for the abolition of the board of trade. The county of **** with great zeal petitioned for the taking away of u&s;ele&s;s places. Had the inciters of tho&s;e petitions, when they came into power, pur&s;ued the de&s;ign with the &s;ame &s;incerity with which they were &s;upported by the duped counties, they would not have le&s;t room to &s;u&s;pect that the de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the emoluments of Lord <HI>North</HI>'s ad|mini&s;tration was not the chief end by them propo&s;ed. Let me name another merit of this reign, for the &s;ecurity of our liberties, in which the Commons had no &s;hare, I mean the &s;pontaneous act of the crown which has made the judges independent of the King by giving them their places for life.</P>
<P>To the&s;e merits of the King, let me oppo&s;e one glaring deme|rit of the Commons. Did not the repre&s;entatives of the people, in 1716, betray their rights by the &s;eptennial act, and ve&s;t in
<PB N="94" REF="100">them&s;elves four years more of power than the con&s;titution or their con&s;tituents ever intended? I will not enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the eventual good or evil. The charge ought to be &s;ubject of deep con&s;ideration with electors and elected. But if it was wrong, is not the pre&s;ent majority <HI>particeps criminis,</HI> by permitting it to continue unrepealed? But does there not appear the greater probability of its de&s;ign of a&s;&s;uming a far longer continuance of its own power, &s;hould it not be appalled by the warning voice of the people? I cannot give it a grain of credit for any one act of forbearance, any pretended moderation, &s;ince the awful &s;ound begins to roll over its head.</P>
<P>THE King has lately dared to make u&s;e of his prerogative, in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his late &s;ervants, for uncon&s;titutionally trying to divert into another branch of the legi&s;lature his great prerogative of the di&s;po&s;al of places. Plea&s;e to apprehend <HI>that</HI> to be the only part of Mr. <HI>Fox's India</HI> bill to which I make any objection. I &s;hould hold chartered rights mo&s;t &s;acred; but not &s;uch which have affec|ted the lives and properties of millions, in the manner in which the abu&s;e of power is pretended to have done in our <HI>Indian</HI> empire.</P>
<P>IN place of the mini&s;try di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, his maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to put at the head of the new one a youth endued, I may &s;ay, with miraculous abilities; one in whom malice can find as few defects as can be found in human nature. When I had the honor of &s;peaking to you on the &s;ubject of his virtues, in the &s;hort conver&s;ation I had with you in your way to town, you &s;eemed to have had no objection to him. Has his &s;hort admi|ni&s;tration been marked by any flagitious deed? Would it not have been fair to have given the man of the King's choice a &s;hort trial? Or, is it not becau&s;e he is the man of the King's
<PB N="95" REF="101">choice that the majority of mouths are open again&s;t him? I hope his virtues are not the object of jealou&s;y, and that the eloquence of <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> is not to bear down the virtues of <HI>Ari&s;tides!</HI> &s;urely the majority do not &s;ign the &s;hell becau&s;e they are angry at every body calling <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> ju&s;t?</P>
<P>CERTAINLY there are &s;trong contra&s;ts to his character, who unite their force to pull him down. Why &s;hould the affairs of the whole nation be &s;topped at the in&s;tance of &s;uch per&s;ons? Could you not &s;uffer the bu&s;ine&s;s to go on, with only the proper objections to what was wrong? Surely the taxes might have pa&s;&s;ed, in order to prevent what may po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue, univer&s;al bankruptcy. But moderation mu&s;t not be adopted; it will &s;uit neither the views nor intere&s;ts of a &s;et of men, whom po|verty and ambition have made nearly de&s;perate. The non&s;en|&s;ical exploded cry of &s;ecret influence is for private ends again revived.</P>
<P>EXCUSE me for reminding you (but remind you I mu&s;t) of the declaration you made at the la&s;t general election, that you would enli&s;t under no party, follow no &s;et of men; the per|formance is far from impracticable; many illu&s;trious charac|ters, who ob&s;erve tho&s;e excellent rules, exi&s;t at this very time. Your con&s;tituents wi&s;h you to do the &s;ame. They wi&s;h to prevale on you to compare your &s;entiments with theirs; the &s;ooner it is done, the le&s;s will be the violence of the alteration. I fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the communication of our &s;entiments, and from my model (&s;uch as is inclo&s;ed) is drawn the declaration which I apprehend has by this time been &s;ent to you from the gentle|men of ****, with the approbation of many re&s;pected charac|ters in this end of the county. You need not &s;tart at the te&s;t offered to you. It is not de&s;igned to bind you to any party,
<PB N="96" REF="102">to any &s;et of men. It contains only con&s;titutional fundamentals, &s;uch as you might &s;ub&s;cribe without any derogation from your honor. If the name offends, change it to 'in&s;tructions,' and the offence is done away. Why &s;hould the majority be alarmed at &s;ub&s;cribing to undeniable duties, who are daily offering to their Sovereign the mo&s;t mortifying covenants? This &s;quea|mi&s;h nicety reminds me of the giant in <HI>Rabelais,</HI> who daily &s;wal|lowed wind-mills for his breakfa&s;t, and at la&s;t was choaked with a lump of butter before the mouth of a warm oven.</P>
<P>To conclude: there is not a wi&s;h to change our repre&s;entative, provided he acts con&s;onant to our principles; but none of us ought to give up principle for affection. I tru&s;t that your an|&s;wer will be clear and decided; &s;o that in &s;upporting you we &s;hall &s;upport the dictates of our own con&s;ciences. The great majority of your con&s;tituents are firm friends to the legal prero|gative. They will re-elect you; yet how mu&s;t they blu&s;h at their incon&s;i&s;tency if you take an adver&s;e part! I have been your friend, and I &s;hall be &s;orry to withdraw my intere&s;t from you. Excu&s;e me again if I &s;ay, with the &s;pirit of a freeman, this mu&s;t re&s;t in your&s;elf. If we differ in &s;entiments, there ought to be mutual forgivene&s;s, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to expect from either &s;ide a criminal compliment. I have never yet deceived you; nor will I begin in this late period of life. If we are &s;o unhappy to di&s;agree in opinion, I will not vote again&s;t you: but cannot vote for you.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE EDITOR OF THE GENERAL EVENING POST.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE><HI>Havod y lom, Feb.</HI> 1781.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE long been very &s;en&s;ible of the &s;everal improvements which the military &s;pirit, &s;o prevalent in the&s;e kingdoms, and the frequent incampments, have introduced into the mo&s;t di&s;|tant counties. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall forbear mentioning the happy effects they have had on the morals of the male part of the com|munity, and confine my&s;elf to that &s;ex to which we are indebted for every thing which renders life endurable. I was always its &s;incere admirer; and am happy to find any occa&s;ion of pointing out what&s;oever may add to their charms, or extend their con|que&s;ts.</P>
<P>I WAS la&s;t &s;ummer in a gentleman's family in the inland part of <HI>England,</HI> with whom I had a long and intimate acquaintance. I happened to reach the place in the dog-days; and finding the
<PB N="98" REF="104">ladies &s;itting in an alcove in their cloth riding habits, in&s;tead of their cool chintzes, I expre&s;&s;ed my fear that I prevented them from taking their morning ride. They a&s;&s;ured me, they did not mean to &s;tir out; and one of them, clapping on a va&s;t hat with a cockade, declared &s;he would only go for her work, and &s;it down for the re&s;t of the morning. On turning round, how was my ru&s;ticity &s;urprized to &s;ee her hair clubbed behind! ano|ther gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing a whi&s;king queue; and a third a grea&s;y braid, hanging down and dabbing the &s;hining cape!</P>
<P>AFTER the morning was far &s;pent, Mi&s;s <HI>Dorothy</HI> (for, in imi|tation of the quality, there are now no &s;uch things as <HI>Dollies, Mollies,</HI> and <HI>Betties</HI>) with a great yawn flung her arms over her head, and her legs a yard before her, and informed us, it was dre&s;|&s;ing time: then pulling her watch out of (I believe) a tight lea|thern breeches, acquainted us, that it was half pa&s;t two; and re|turned it to its place with a mo&s;t officer-like air.</P>
<P>I SAW the countenance of my good old friend change. As &s;oon as the ladies had left the place, he gave vent to his di&s;con|tent in the following terms: "My dear <HI>Jack,"</HI> &s;ays he, <Q>what an alteration is there in the manners of this hou&s;e &s;ince I la&s;t had the happine&s;s of your company! A cur&s;ed vi&s;it to <HI>Coxheath</HI> hath infected my poor girls to a degree that gives me the keene&s;t concern. The cha&s;te and elegant dre&s;s, which was once their characteri&s;tic, is now converted into what you have ju&s;t &s;een. Female delicacy is changed into ma&s;culine cou|rage, and as much of the garb a&s;&s;umed as at fir&s;t view almo&s;t leaves the difference of &s;ex undi&s;tingui&s;hable. The manly habit is put on with the morning, and, as you will &s;ee pre|&s;ently, only changed for another of the &s;ame kind. The
<PB N="99" REF="105">watch too has al&s;o quitted its mode&s;t &s;tation, and the fair wearer, in&s;tead of con&s;ulting the hour with the former grace|ful recline of the head, now boldly lugs out the oracle, and a&s;terwards thru&s;ts it&mdash;the lord knows where! My niece <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> in defence of this new mode, &s;ays, that its motions are con&s;iderably altered &s;ince it had experienced a new &s;itua|tion. No wonder, &s;ince it had quitted the temperate for the torrid zone. A long &s;tring, with all the ma&s;culine load of &s;eals, &amp;c. now affectedly hangs down the center of the fair frame; &s;ometimes it is formed of hair, ending with a &s;trange fringe of the &s;ame. A celebrated antiquarian a&s;&s;ured me that this was the true love-lock. And a wicked rogue added, that it was an excellent conductor of amorous ideas to our &s;ex, a remembrancer to our &s;lack youth, and, like a &s;trange peculiarity in the dre&s;s of the ladies of <HI>Siam,</HI> which &s;erves as a whet to the depraved appetites of their copper-coloured gallants. In&s;tead of&mdash;</Q> I could no longer bear his pro&s;|ing, &s;o diverted the di&s;cour&s;e: but not without giving internal a&s;&s;ent to part of his reflections, even tinctured as they were by the fooli&s;h prejudices of old age. Laudable as a due attention is to fa&s;hion in young people, yet I was brought to confe&s;s that there were indecencies in tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent year, which are the di&s;gu&s;t of the grave, the &s;coff of the licentious; are marks of a light mind, or bring under &s;u&s;picion of levity the pure&s;t heart, which thoughtle&s;sly adopts the un&s;uitable manners or ha|bit of our &s;ex.</P>

<OPENER><DATE><HI>Old Bond-&s;treet, Augu&s;t</HI> 10, 1774.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS the other day in a coffee-hou&s;e filled with (not the fir&s;t rate) company of this great town, where I long &s;ate indig|nant at the topic which employed every tongue. I could have born with patience the common &s;ubjects of politics, the mere offspring of ignorance and rancour; but when I found their licentious mouths filled with the mo&s;t infamous inferences, drawn from the unhappy conduct of a lady not le&s;s eminent for her rank than her beauty, I flung down my penny in a rage, and retired to my apartments full of reflections on &s;ome events unfortunately at this time too well known.</P>
<P>THE love of fame in either &s;ex is a principle implanted in us for the mo&s;t noble purpo&s;es, and is often of it&s;elf productive of the mo&s;t important and generous effects. The character of the tender part of the creation confines them to a narrower &s;phere of action: but their duties are not le&s;s con&s;equential than tho&s;e of our &s;ex, which make more eclat; and are attended with all the rewards that public merit can claim. If it is the lot of the fair to become wives and parents, a virtuous di&s;charge of the duties of tho&s;e relations &s;hould be the &s;um of their ambition. But if
<PB N="101" REF="107">it be their fortune to remain &s;ingle, an equal fame will attend them by that delicacy and ea&s;e of behaviour towards the men, which form the genuine characteri&s;tics of virtue. If once this hone&s;t &s;pecies of ambition for&s;akes them, and an anxiety after foreign admiration &s;eizes them, they become the mark of every profligate wretch, or fluttering in&s;ect; who may perhaps &s;inge his wings, but at the &s;ame time is &s;ure to impair the brightne&s;s of the luminary. Every &s;oft look, and every little levity, be|comes encouragement; and the enduring of one free action is &s;ure to lay a foundation for another. The man of gallantry pre&s;umes on appearances, mi&s;takes culpable vanity for vitious inclinations, and in the end, mo&s;t de&s;ervedly, &s;uffers for his er|ror: he is di&s;gracefully driven from the chateau by in&s;ulting do|me&s;tics; or &s;uffers &s;till more marked mortifications, at the com|mand of the in&s;ulted fair. She di&s;tre&s;&s;es her poor hu&s;band with her complaints: &s;he wonders at the fellow's impudence. Alas! what can the unhappy &s;pou&s;e reply, but what mu&s;t add to her and his own mi&s;ery? He may (but it is more likely his &s;u&s;picions may take an unhappy turn at the &s;ame time) he may, I &s;ay, allow her to be innocent at the bottom; but he will re|proach her with having given the gallant every rea&s;on to expect an ea&s;y conque&s;t: he may al&s;o unju&s;tly conceive a jealou&s;y that there may have been, or that there &s;till may be, moments when poor virtue may be caught napping, and the &s;um of female di&s;|honour effected. His peace of mind is gone; and mutual wretchedne&s;s becomes the price of the mere moments of levity, or the love of tran&s;ient admiration.</P>
<P>EVERY attempt for that purpo&s;e becomes criminal; &s;ince the conclu&s;ion is often as uncertain as it is unexpected. To call
<PB N="102" REF="108">aloud in public to men of gaiety; to &s;uffer an unmeaning whi&s;|per; or to retire to a remote &s;eat; are acts which bring with them the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t cruel &s;candal. In private company to force your&s;elf at table almo&s;t on the lap of your favorite; to rivet your eye on his; to catch frequently at his hand, or every now and then to place your's on his knee; or mutually to dan|gle your hands over the elbow chair, that they may come un|perceived in contact, give as great di&s;gu&s;t to the company as they do &s;olid injury to the reputation of the fair offender, whe|ther &s;he is married or whether &s;he is &s;ingle. If the object of attraction be a married man, how aggravated is the offence: how pitiable is the &s;ituation of the poor injured &s;pou&s;e! And yet this &s;pecies of conduct is very frequent, but never is pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed: the encouragement either brings unhappine&s;s on the thoughtle&s;s fair; or bu&s;y &s;candal fixes on her an indelible blot: a cruel penalty! yet &s;he falls unpitied, as it is brought on her by a criminal or in&s;olent inattention to appearances.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">MISCELLANIES. FLINTSHIRE PETITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE clamors rai&s;ed in the year 1779, and the apparent di&s;contents grew to &s;uch a height, that I thought it pru|dent
that the county of <HI>Flint</HI> &s;hould add its weight to the pe|tition, &s;o that by prevaling on government to le&s;&s;en every un|nece&s;&s;ary burden, the minds of the people might be ea&s;ed, and all ill con&s;equences prevented, for civil war was almo&s;t threat|ened. I at all times profe&s;&s;ed my abhorrence of committees and a&s;&s;ociations. Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn</HI> advi&s;ed me to write to &s;ome of our principal gentlemen to inform them of the terms on which I undertook to excite the county to petition, &s;o that they might decline &s;ub&s;cribing to the requi&s;ition, in ca&s;e they di&s;liked my plan: or if they did &s;ign it, &s;upport me to its full extent. None to whom I wrote appeared at the meeting. Mr. <HI>Yonge,</HI> one of the friends to whom I wrote, di&s;liked the petition, and declined &s;igning the requi&s;ition. Sir <HI>Stephen Glynn,</HI> bart. and <HI>Philip Lloyd Fletcher,</HI> e&s;q. approved my plan, and promi&s;ed it every &s;upport, and to adhere to the very letter of it. Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> al&s;o
<PB N="104" REF="110">&s;ent my letter along with the requi&s;ition to the gentlemen of his neighborhood, that they might not mi&s;take the terms on which they were to &s;ign. I came to the meeting in a full re|liance on the faith of my countrymen: but the dean of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> burning after the glory of chairman of a committee, and backed by friends he brought with him, propo&s;ed a committee, and carried his point.</P>
<P>I DID intend to deliver the following &s;peech, but my &s;pirits failed me.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>BEING totally unu&s;ed to &s;peak in public, I beg leave, in faultering words, to lay before you the motives which induced me to promote this meeting.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the times are too evident to admit of con|tradiction. To have recour&s;e to any legal method of alleviating our &s;ufferings is extremely natural. The only one which pre|&s;ents it&s;elf is, 'by petition to the high court of parliament,' a pri|vilege pre&s;erved to us by the BILL of RIGHTS, and which can never be exerted with more propriety than at pre&s;ent, provided re&s;pect and moderation attend it.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid by an able &s;peaker on the &s;ide of oppo&s;ition, 'that 300,000l. may be annually &s;aved by retrenching the emoluments of offices, and aboli&s;hing the long train of u&s;ele&s;s placemen and pen&s;ioners.' As I make no doubt but this gen|tleman can &s;upport his a&s;&s;ertion, let me ob&s;erve, that the above &s;um will, at the rate of five per cent. pay the intere&s;t of more than &s;ix millions of money; and of cour&s;e, in the next year, ea&s;e the all-&s;upporting landlord and tenant from a burden equal to that &s;um.</P>
<P>THIS alone, in the nece&s;&s;itous &s;tate of our country (which
<PB N="105" REF="111">from the nature of its trade &s;uffers more in proportion than others) ought to determine us to make u&s;e of the propo&s;ed me|thod of relief, leaving it to the wi&s;dom of parlement &s;everely to &s;crutinize into the nature of our grievances, and to rectify every one which may be di&s;covered to exi&s;t. It is ju&s;t to enquire before we condemn. Let the accu&s;ed, if guilty, &s;uffer the penalty of their neglect; if innocent, acquitted with honor. But let the minds of the people be ea&s;ed, by a proper enquiry into the foundation of the national di&s;content.</P>
<P>THAT invaluable compilation the <HI>Red-book</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edition 1779, pages 39, 122.</NOTE> furni&s;hes me with a very &s;ingular in&s;tance of a place of little moment, attend|ed with a high &s;alary. I cannot but &s;mile at &s;eeing the repre|&s;entative of one of our fir&s;t cities, and one of the lords commi&s;|&s;ioners of the admiralty, unite with that important charge the po&s;t of <HI>letter-carrier</HI> to the court, with the lavi&s;h &s;alary of 730l. a year. The duty might perhaps be performed (if any there is) by a le&s;s re&s;pectable per&s;on, for 2s. 6d. a day; and I will not pay a very worthy gentleman &s;o bad a compliment, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that his principles will be in the le&s;t altered by being free from &s;uch a degrading office.</P>
<P>MANY &s;imilar in&s;tances may probably be found, all worthy of being lopped off: but let me do the times the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that few of them are of recent formation; they are the antient marks of regal &s;tate, created in pro&s;perous days. In the progre&s;s of enquiry, it will be worthy to remark the periods when they cea&s;ed to be ornaments to the crown, and became the in&s;tru|ments of corruption.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112">THE affair of contracts is beyond my power to &s;peak to. It will be our wi&s;h that parlement would guard again&s;t the abu&s;e of them, and examine whether the princely &s;tate in which our contractors live, ari&s;es from any thing beyond the fair profits of their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN attending to the report of any party on that &s;ubject, or any other, we ought to take particular care not to be too credu|lous. I &s;ay this becau&s;e of the alarm that has (I tru&s;t cau&s;ele&s;sly) ari&s;en among <HI>us,</HI> of a de&s;ign of altering the courts of ju&s;tice in the principality in a manner grievous to the <HI>Welch:</HI> let us wait with patience till the honorable member has laid open his de&s;ign; and if it is then found to be a grievance, let us re&s;i&s;t it with the &s;ame firmne&s;s as we did the trea&s;ury warrant. I hereby de|clare, not only in my own name, but in that of many re&s;pectable friends, great and &s;mall freeholders, that we do not, by &s;igning the petition before us, exclude our&s;elves from &s;eeking legal re|dre&s;s from any innovation, which may appear unju&s;t and burden|&s;ome, let it come from any quarter what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE body of us petitioners con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;tupendous multi|tude of per&s;ons, actuated with very different objects. I believe I may &s;ay with confidence, that there is not an individual in this a&s;&s;embly who has not the mo&s;t laudable motives in view, ab|&s;tracted from every party &s;pirit what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THERE are many very worthy and well-meaning gentlemen who think we have cho&s;en an improper &s;ea&s;on for petitioning, amid&s;t the rage of war. But let it be ob&s;erved, that the &s;trength of government con&s;i&s;ts in the variety of its re&s;ources, and if we are able to point out a mo&s;t important one, we rather accelerate than impede its motion. In the peaceable times to refu&s;e &s;up|plies
<PB N="107" REF="113">would be a proper in&s;ult to an ob&s;tinate mini&s;ter; but NOW! in the moment of RETURNING VICTORY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Rodney</HI>'s defeat of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;leet, <HI>January</HI> 16th, 1780.</NOTE>! it would be a mea|&s;ure fraught with certain danger and po&s;&s;ible parricide.</P>
<P>I AM not of con&s;equence enough to trouble you with pro|fe&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially as I have no other object than to add my mite to &s;erve my country; I &s;hall only detain you, while I ac|quaint you with the &s;teps I took after I had formed the re&s;olution of exciting the county to a&s;&s;emble on this occa&s;ion. I drew up the requi&s;ition to the &s;heriff: I &s;ent it, accompanied with a letter, exper&s;&s;ive of my &s;entiments, to the three worthy gentle|men before mentioned. That I did not &s;end it to more, was for want of time, not of re&s;pect. From my letter, and from the &s;ub&s;tance of a petition I &s;ent with it, they might judge of the utmo&s;t limits of my intentions, that in ca&s;e they di&s;approved of my de&s;ign, they might decline &s;ub&s;cribing to my requi&s;ition. It was returned to me, &s;igned by an ample number, to whom I beg leave to return thanks for the compliment they were plea&s;ed to pay me.</P>
<P>I objected in that letter, and I do now in the &s;tronge&s;t manner object, to all party-a&s;&s;ociations, and for my&s;elf decline the honors of committee-man.</P>
<P>THE former may end in combinations injurious to our peace, and perhaps fatal at the la&s;t to tho&s;e who embark in them. We MUST not &s;end our repre&s;entative to the hou&s;e with our prayer in one hand, and a dagger in the other. We MUST not attempt to intimidate the hou&s;e from freedom of debate, at the time we are &s;triving to wre&s;t from men of power the pe&s;tilential baits
<PB N="108" REF="114">of corruption: we MUST not wound when we wi&s;h to amend the di&s;ea&s;es of our con&s;titution: we MUST be con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves. The parlement will &s;uffer a civil death in le&s;s than a twelvemonth; it will be the fault of the people if they chu&s;e another compo&s;ed of members with whom they are at pre&s;ent &s;o di&s;contented. They will, when that period arrives, have an opportunity of legally rejecting tho&s;e candidates whom they di&s;approve, and &s;electing tho&s;e only worthy of their confi|dence.</P></Q>
<P>MY mention of petitioning with a dagger in one hand gave great offence; but I thought my&s;elf vindicated by the indecent language of &s;ome of the petitioners, of which the following is a &s;pecimen.</P>
<Q>SUCH were the people who agreed to the petition on which I now lean. Oeconomy in the expenditure of the public money is all they a&s;k. Will any man vote for rejecting &s;o mode&s;t, &s;o rea&s;onable a reque&s;t? I hope not. Will any man vote that this petition be not brought up? No man, I tru&s;t, will dare do it. The mini&s;ter will not dare do it, becau&s;e he knows he ought not to dare it. But there is another thing al&s;o which he ought not to dare; and that is, to attempt to defeat the object of it. If the mini&s;ter is &s;o inclined, with the turn of his finger he may de&s;troy it: but let him beware how he directs his influence again&s;t it. Let me advi&s;e him to be|ware how he in&s;titutes an enquiry into the merits of the peti|tion: it &s;peaks for it&s;elf; and the petitioners will look upon &s;uch an enquiry as a mockery, as a parlementary or mini|&s;terial trick to put an indirect negative upon their petition. When they met to draw it up they were unarmed; they had
<PB N="109" REF="115">neither mu&s;kets nor &s;taves; but if you mock them, they will &mdash; I'll leave blanks for the &s;agacity of the hou&s;e to fill up.</Q>
<P>LORD <HI>Ongly</HI> reprobated the idea of threats, notwith&s;tanding he was a petitioner, and voted in this in&s;tance with the mi|nority.</P>
<Q>LORD <HI>Ongly</HI> reprobated, in &s;evere terms, the connection that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the petition and county a&s;&s;ociations. Threats had been hinted, and more than hinted, if the prayer of this and of other &s;imilar petitions &s;hould be rejected. This alone, in his lord&s;hip's opinion, was &s;ufficient to damn the petition. It puts me in mind, &s;aid he, of the man who went about robbing, under pretence of &s;elling rabbits. He held out the rabbits in one hand, and a pi&s;tol in the other, and very civilly a&s;ked tho&s;e he chanced to meet, whether they cho&s;e to buy any rabbits. Such is the conduct of the peti|tioners in the different counties; a conduct, which, if it is not checked in the bud, may be productive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to the liberty and happine&s;s of this country.</Q>
<P>THE clamor continued. I was attacked in the papers, and I put an end to the war by the following an&s;wer.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much obliged to you for your favor of the 5th in&s;tant. I pay &s;uch deference to your opinion, that I entirely lay a&s;ide all thoughts of troubling your honorable hou&s;e with the affair of repealing the act of exemption of mail-coaches from the payment of tolls. I would avoid every adventure which does not promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;hould be much mortified to be unhor&s;ed and laid &s;prawling on the <HI>arena</HI> of <HI>St. Stephen</HI>'s.</P>
<P>YET I &s;hall be extremely &s;orry that any member of your hou&s;e &s;hould, through any quickne&s;s of mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, wilful or natural, imagine me to be &s;o wild as to think of an attempt that was not founded on rea&s;onable and hone&s;t principles.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that the exemption of the mails from the pay|ment of tolls commenced very early: I think, fir&s;t by an act of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which was afterwards repeated in &s;everal others, till it was oppre&s;&s;ively confirmed by that of the 25th <HI>Geo.</HI> III.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;econd-&s;ighted of your hou&s;e could never have fore|&s;een that the u&s;age of the &s;ingle hor&s;e and po&s;t-boy, afterwards in many parts converted into the light mail-cart drawn by one hor&s;e, would be &s;uper&s;eded by a <HI>royal</HI> carriage drawn by four hor&s;es, and filled by pa&s;&s;engers, who before rode in the common &s;tages, and contributed to &s;upport the roads which they pa&s;&s;ed over. This unfortunate change proceeded
<PB N="114" REF="119">from an extent of prerogative, repined at only when perverted to the injury of the &s;ubject; as this mo&s;t inconte&s;tably mu&s;t be allowed to have done.</P>
<P>UNDER the &s;anction of the fir&s;t act, turnpike gates were erect|ed, and immen&s;e &s;ums of money lent on the national faith. For a long time the &s;ecurity was e&s;teemed good; and in <HI>Wales,</HI> where five per cent. was given, people at fir&s;t were happy to place their money on mortgages they imagined &s;o &s;afe. The transfer was then ea&s;y, and the public re&s;ted perfectly content. The commi&s;&s;ioners did their duty fully: they laid out the money to the be&s;t advantage; nor did they de&s;i&s;t till the lower|ing of the tolls, by the fatal change of the mode of conveyance, had taken place.</P>
<P>I WILL exemplify the hard&s;hips only in the country I live. Other places equally remote from the capital mu&s;t come in for their &s;hare of the grievance: but they will fall under the com|mon de&s;cription.</P>
<P>BEFORE the in&s;titution of mail-coaches, two &s;tage-coaches ran through the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> And, were it not for an eva&s;ion, the change of hor&s;es between gate and gate in the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;|trict, one of the di&s;tricts principally aggrieved, each would have paid forty pounds a year. This unhappily was left unguarded in the act. By the help of that eva&s;ion both together only paid that &s;um: and even that &s;um, had we not been deprived of it, would have enabled us to take up 800l. more; and given us the power of repairing every part of the road which was not unexceptionably good.</P>
<P>MANY parts may have been allowed to have been indifferent; but they were adequate to the u&s;es of the country, not only for
<PB N="115" REF="120">the u&s;e of the farmers and the carriers, but al&s;o for the luxury of carriages.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate they were found at the introduction of mail|coaches. The&s;e &s;oon occa&s;ioned the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the common &s;tages, and deprived us at once of forty pounds of annual in|come. In the year 1789, a per&s;on was &s;ent from the general po&s;t-office to &s;urvey the roads. From his report, and by the orders of the po&s;t-office, indictments were preferred at the great &s;e&s;&s;ions at <HI>Mold,</HI> again&s;t the whole extent of road in the narrow but long county of <HI>Flint.</HI> In &s;ome in&s;tances, I fear the grand jury made a &s;train of their con&s;ciences in finding the bills; for &s;ome of the indicted places were in mo&s;t admirable repair. But we were unwilling to ob&s;truct any thing that tended to promote the public good.</P>
<P>FINES to the amount of 1200 l. were impo&s;ed on the &s;everal town&s;hips, many of which were very &s;mall, and the inhabitants compo&s;ed of &s;mall farmers, and laborers, poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e town&s;hips had a great extent of road, and only a few labourers, and a few mi&s;erable teams, to perform their &s;ta|tute duty. One of the&s;e town&s;hips, terrified with the pro&s;pect of ruin, by the execution of the <HI>&s;ummum jus,</HI> performed twenty-two days duty upon the road. The other town&s;hip had only a &s;ingle farmer living in it, who performed a duty of twenty-eight days.</P>
<P>THE va&s;t expences which the commi&s;&s;ioners had been at in the repairs of the roads, had almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the credit, in &s;ome totally; &s;o that at pre&s;ent 50 l. cannot be obtained for 400l. worth of our parchment &s;ecurities.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="121">AT this period I was moved with compa&s;&s;ion at the complaint and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor. This induced me to write my circu|lar letter to the &s;everal grand juries of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> in order to induce them to unite in a common cau&s;e. I blu&s;h at my want of &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;ulting from either ignorance of, or indif|ference to, the fir&s;t principles of &s;ecurity of property. I was &s;imple enough to think that the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e would have in&s;ured an approbation of my plan. In&s;tead of that, I am told, that in &s;ome places it was even treated with rudene&s;s and con|tempt. I ventured even to write to two gentlemen with whom I was not per&s;onally acquainted: they never paid the le&s;t atten|tion to my letter: they forgot my character, and they forgot their own.</P>
<P>I TOOK the liberty of getting my circular letter conveyed to a third gentleman high in office, with whom I was acquainted. It was returned with (written on a corner of it) "Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> is in the wrong, and I will have no concern in the affair." The gentleman may be politically right; but I am confident that Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> is not morally wrong.</P>
<P>THERE has certainly been a &s;trong mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of my meaning. I did not intend the abolition of mail-coaches: they have their objections; whether we con&s;ider the barbarity with which the poor hor&s;es are treated, or the very frequent de&s;truc|tion of the pa&s;&s;engers&mdash;our old <HI>Jehus</HI> may have &s;lain their thou|&s;ands; our modern, their tens of thou&s;ands. I only wi&s;hed that they might not prove oppre&s;&s;ive to many of our counties, by cau&s;es I have before mentioned. True it is, that, in my fir&s;t circular letter, I did mo&s;t ra&s;hly and unadvi&s;edly hint, that they might, without injury, be converted into the mail-cart.
<PB N="117" REF="122">The gentlemen of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> who, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, did ad|mit that &s;omething &s;hould be done for us, very ju&s;tly fired on the idea of &s;ending their <HI>The&s;pis</HI> again into his cart. A worthy friend of mine of that county warmly but kindly expo&s;tulated with me on the &s;ubject: but I hope this my declaration of re|pentance will be admitted, and atone for my error.</P>
<P>THE grand juries of <HI>Che&s;hire, Berk&s;hire, Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>North Wales,</HI> united in the &s;upport of my de&s;ign. The re&s;t of the counties proved to me the truth of the remark of <HI>Swift,</HI><Q>That he never knew any per&s;on who did not bear the misfortunes of another perfectly like a Chri&s;tian!</Q></P>
<P>FAR the majority of the roads in <HI>England</HI> have great revenues, ari&s;ing from the multitude of &s;tage-coaches that keep their ground in defiance of mails. Our &s;tages the obliged to de&s;i&s;t from travelling, and give the former a mo&s;t unju&s;t and oppre&s;|&s;ive monopoly. The counties intere&s;ted in them feel not our unhappine&s;s, and want genero&s;ity to contribute to the allevia|tion of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es we &s;uffer.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould have made a claim on the ju&s;tice of the hou&s;e, had we had the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. We are now in the ca&s;e of creditors defrauded by the &s;uperior cunning of an artful debtor. Had an individual received an adequate mort|gage on his e&s;tate, and had afterwards the dexterity to le&s;&s;en the income, what name would he have de&s;erved? The highe&s;t term of reproach; but &s;uch a one that could never be applied the mo&s;t remotely to any member of your honorable hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS affair has never yet been &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered. Good men, I tru&s;t, will now awake as from a &s;leep; and &s;tand amazed and confu&s;ed at the &s;ad delu&s;ion they di&s;covered that they had labored under. Favourite &s;y&s;tems run away with mankind,
<PB N="118" REF="123">and totally annihilate all attention to the inconveniences they occa&s;ion. The act was obtained late in the &s;e&s;&s;ions, hurried through a very thin hou&s;e, and with the &s;lighte&s;t oppo&s;ition. The legi&s;lature obliges a certain time of notice to be given be|fore the introduction of a common turnpike bill. Let me a&s;k. Should not at le&s;t the interval of a &s;e&s;&s;ion have been given for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;o &s;trange and unequal a taxation?</P>
<P>WHAT, may I a&s;k, could make the individual liable to cen|&s;ure; and the actions of the collective body be pa&s;&s;ed over without blame? Either the numbers defend, or &s;ome daemon, like the gho&s;tly father of <HI>Charles</HI> I. has whi&s;pered in your ears, Have a double con&s;cience! one that is to make you con&s;ult the plain dictates of hone&s;ty: the other telling you to &s;upport &s;ome fancied public good, at the expence of a certain number of per&s;ons, who, in times not very remote, had tru&s;ted their money to the &s;ecurity of the public faith.</P>
<P>OR may you not hold the &s;ame doctrine as the nuns in <HI>Tri&s;|tram Shandy;</HI> that the divi&s;ibility of &s;in may enable you to fritter it away into almo&s;t nothing?&mdash;You certainly have the advan|tage, The nuns were but two, you are five hundred and fifty-two to bear the feather-weight of the wrong deci&s;ion, you had mo&s;t unwarily been induced to make.</P>
<P>LET me now a&s;k, Are there no in&s;tances of repeal of acts on far le&s;s important occa&s;ions? I well recollect two. The fir&s;t is the <HI>Jew Act,</HI> which had in fact no con&s;equences to be feared, religious or political. The other was the cyder tax, e&s;teemed like ours a partial grievance; and yet its overthrow was ea&s;ily effected. I reflect on the&s;e two acts repeated without cau&s;e, and on our oppre&s;&s;ions continued in defiance of every principle of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124">SINCE your honorable hou&s;e was determined to weaken our &s;ecurities, ought it not to have fir&s;t paid off every turnpike mortgage? and then you might have had full liberty of doing what you plea&s;ed with the income of the gates.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to lay before you a ca&s;e in which your hou&s;e once &s;hewed a mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention to the rights of creditors. That was by the repeal of a clau&s;e in the <HI>King&s;land</HI> turnpike act. Part of it leads from <HI>Shoreditch</HI> to <HI>Ware,</HI> and this part was cro&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Newmarket</HI> road, and tolls were taken by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Ware</HI> road, from all travellers to and from that &s;eminary of virtue, merely for cro&s;&s;ing the road. On the re|newing of the <HI>King&s;land</HI> turnpike act, the <HI>Newmarket</HI> people in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould pa&s;s free of tolls. A clau&s;e was in|&s;erted in the new act for that purpo&s;e, and the cro&s;s-gates were pulled down. The creditors of the <HI>King&s;land</HI> turnpike peti|tioned to the hou&s;e of commons for redre&s;s; they &s;ucceeded, and the cro&s;s-gates were again erected, and the tolls taken till the whole of the creditors were paid.</P>

<P><PB N="120" REF="125">I IMAGINE that there is not a member of the hou&s;e who has not acted as a commi&s;&s;ioner of the turnpikes. Let me reque&s;t him to call to mind, whether he has not in that character, or in the character of a magi&s;trate, treated with a har&s;h &s;everity the delinquent who, through poverty, has defrauded the gate of nine-pence. What pleas of con&s;cience have not the commi&s;&s;ioners urged for maintaining the intere&s;ts of the gates, and di&s;charging their tru&s;t like men of honor? Is there not a <HI>Lethean</HI> atmo|&s;phere in the chapel of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> &s;o &s;uddenly to efface all me|mory of tran&s;actions in the common air of the world? I tru&s;t that there is: otherwi&s;e the individual who, in one place and in one character, had been &s;o &s;trenuous to &s;ave a poor nine-pence, &s;hould in another place, and in another character, vote as a per|qui&s;ite to the comptroller-general of the po&s;t-office, an exemp|tion of the mails from toll, a &s;um amounting to not le&s;s than 90,000l. a year, on which he has a mo&s;t con&s;iderable poundage, be&s;ides &s;ome very good pickings from other articles. This I am a&s;&s;ured of by a worthy member of your hou&s;e. I think his &s;alary is but 1500l. per ann. What a mon&s;trous quantity of &s;ack is allowed to his halfpennyworth of bread!</P>
<P>So liberally &s;upplied as the comptroller has been with the means, cannot &s;omething be deducted to relieve our complaint? If the honorable hou&s;e does not choo&s;e this mode, a &s;mall, a very &s;mall tax on the pa&s;&s;engers, and on the immen&s;e &s;ums got by the carriage of parcels, would compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of exemption of tolls. The rich <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> di&s;tricts would be above taking advantage of this diminution of revenue to the comp|troller-general. It is only for the poor <HI>Welch</HI> di&s;tricts, and a few others like circum&s;tanced, for which it is humbly a&s;ked.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="126">I HAVE a re&s;pect for the plan of the mail-coaches, and for the inventor; but I never could think of applying to him as the <HI>ni|zam al muluc,</HI> the regulator of the po&s;ting-empire. There ought not to be in our con&s;titution &s;uch a mon&s;ter as a comptroller un|controllable by his legi&s;lature, or his &s;uperiors in office: legi&s;la|ture mu&s;t now &s;ee its imprudence in permitting a latitude of &s;o dangerous a nature. I, an individual, never could bear the thought: I looked for redre&s;s to the po&s;t-ma&s;ter general, or to the three e&s;tates of the kingdom.</P>
<P>I FEAR too great a veneration has been paid to this new-created office, and mode of conveying the mail. I always wi&s;h to pay every individual and every office a due re&s;pect; but in this ca&s;e I mu&s;t pre&s;erve the independent and u&s;eful man, and endeavour to correct every abu&s;e that falls within my &s;phere as a provincial magi&s;trate. What I am going to &s;ay may be deemed foreign to a legi&s;lative friend; yet as it may prove u&s;eful to many who be|hold the&s;e new vehicles with a kind of veneration, I &s;hall men|tion an affair which happened in our county in the la&s;t autumn. Let me premi&s;e, that tho&s;e protectors of the mail, the guards, relying on the name of royalty, had in the cour&s;e of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> road through <HI>North Wales,</HI> committed great exce&s;&s;es. One, on a trifling quarrel, &s;hot dead a poor old gate-keeper: a coroner's jury was huddled up; and, in defiance of the tears of the widow, no judicial notice has been taken of the affair to this very day. In <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> another of the&s;e guards di&s;charged his pi&s;tol wan|tonly in the face of a chai&s;e hor&s;e, drawing his ma&s;ter, the Rev. <HI>John Bulkely,</HI> who was flung out, and died either on the &s;pot or &s;oon a&s;ter. The&s;e guards &s;hoot at dogs, hogs, &s;heep and poultry,
<PB N="122" REF="127">as they pa&s;s the road, and even in towns, to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants. I determined to put a &s;top to the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, and &s;oon had an opportunity.</P>
<P>A NEIGHBORING gate-keeper laid before me a complaint, that one of the guards had threatened to blow his brains out; and had actually &s;hot a dog that had offended him by his barking. I i&s;&s;ued out my warrant, had the guard &s;eized, and brought before me. He was a man who, for his great beauty and elegant per|&s;on, was called the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales.</HI> I did not he&s;itate to play the Judge <HI>Ga&s;coigne;</HI> but from the goodne&s;s of his appearance, and the propriety of his behaviour, I did not go quite the length that famous magi&s;trate did. I took bail for his appearance at our quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions. He appeared before us, when, by the permi&s;&s;ion of the chairman, I took the lead in &s;peaking. I repre&s;ented to the audience, that the guards were intru&s;ted with arms merely for the protection of the mail and the pa&s;&s;engers, not for the terror of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; that a mail-coach was no &s;anctuary; that the bailiff might drag the debtor out of it; the con&s;table, the felon; the exci&s;eman might rummage it for contraband goods, and that with as little ceremony as if it had been a higler's cart. I far|ther added, had the driver been the offender, as the guard was, he &s;hould have been taken into cu&s;tody, and the po&s;t-ma&s;ter of the di&s;trict left to provide another to convey the mail to the next &s;tage. The behaviour of the delinquent was &s;o becoming his &s;ituation, that by the leave of the court I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the offender with &s;uch a reprimand as became the high &s;tation of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ju&s;tice of the peace: an office in dignity and con&s;titutional utility inferior to none in the land. Young men of the age, early initiate your&s;elves into that great character!</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="128">I BEG pardon for detaining you &s;o long, but &s;o much I thought was due to my&s;elf and to the public. A few papers I have &s;ubjoined will fling &s;ome farther light on the &s;ubject, as well as on my proceedings from the beginning. I remain, with much regard,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much indebted to you for your late favor, with an official letter inclo&s;ed. I have no kind of doubt but that the comp|troller general will, on cool re-con&s;ideration of his de&s;ign of altering the cour&s;e of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> mail, be induced to lay it totally a&s;ide. He will admit the importance of the county of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> in its ancient &s;taple of the chee&s;e, on which our fleets and armies &s;o greatly depend. The city it&s;elf (if I may judge by the fre|quent adverti&s;ements) is about to enter deeply on the fu&s;tian manufacture. The great remittances of taxes from the county, and from great part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and the remittances to and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by the great biennial linen fairs, mu&s;t be flung into the &s;cale.</P>
<P>THE port of <HI>Park-Gate</HI> has of late years ri&s;en into much con|&s;equence. It at pre&s;ent maintains four &s;tout pacquets, which un|interruptedly ply between that port and <HI>Dublin.</HI> The corre&s;pon|dencies of the numbers of pa&s;&s;engers embarking or di&s;embark|ing, and the great remittances through this channel, are of no &s;mall moment, and of great general concern.</P>
<P>THE county of <HI>Flint</HI> (little as it is of it&s;elf), thanks to you and other companies, &s;ettling among us, is now ri&s;ing into an amazing &s;tate of opulence: few perhaps can rival it. Our an|cient
<PB N="125" REF="130">cient lead trade was always con&s;iderable; but by the introduction of the copper and cotton bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Holywell,</HI> its environs, and their dependencies, may boa&s;t of commercial property, proba|bly to the amount of a million &s;terling.</P>
<P>I HAVE always con&s;idered Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI>'s plan as u&s;eful to his country, and an honor to him&s;elf, except in one article. I can never &s;uppo&s;e that he will per&s;i&s;t in deviating from the utility of his &s;cheme, by diverting the mail from &s;uch a country as I have de&s;cribed. <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> has already its mail; after <HI>O&s;we&s;try</HI> is pa&s;t, the greate&s;t part of the road to <HI>Conwy</HI> is mountainous, poor, and half depopulated.</P>
<P>IT gives me concern to find our intere&s;ts cla&s;h with tho&s;e of the county of <HI>Salop.</HI> I mu&s;t allow the excellency of the great &s;taples of its capital, brawn and rich cakes; but &s;till we have the balance in our favor; for on the mo&s;t exact and impartial calculation, I do not find that at pre&s;ent the annual con&s;umption (of both to|gether) can po&s;&s;ibly exceed the &s;um of 152,341l. 16s. 9&frac34;d.</P>
<P>THE exceptionable article I allude to is the exemption of the mail-coaches from tolls. This falls heavy on the le&s;&s;er di&s;tricts: po&s;&s;ibly we might have endured even that, had we not been in|&s;ulted with indictments, and compelled to repairs beyond the real wants of the country. That is now over; we only wi&s;h the re&s;toration of our lo&s;t tolls, to enable us to &s;upport the roads in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and to take away all future grounds of com|plaint from every quarter. This will induce me to per&s;i&s;t in my de&s;ign of applying to parlement for redre&s;s of the grievance that affects the gates from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Conwy,</HI> let the rich <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> di&s;tricts take what &s;hare they plea&s;e in their own concerns. There is one difficulty in <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> in re&s;pect to the road it&s;elf&mdash;I mean
<PB N="126" REF="131"><HI>Rhiallt Hill;</HI> the alteration is beyond the power of the poor pa|ri&s;h it lies in, and beyond the power of the poor <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict to effect. Po&s;&s;ibly the improvement may co&s;t from 300l. to 400l. a &s;um adequate to the e&s;timate has been rai&s;ed by the vo|luntary &s;ub&s;cription of the neighboring gentlemen: and the placo mo&s;tly complained of, has been mo&s;t nobly improved, at the ex|pence of 221l. 18s. 3d. I wi&s;h a &s;mall &s;um might be got from parlement, for that and the relief of a few other poor town&s;hips. I cannot bear to drive over roads &s;moothed by the bread of the poor pea&s;antry. If the mail will be permanent, I will cheerfully &s;ub&s;cribe fifty guineas towards that improvement. I &s;hall con|clude with &s;aying, that a &s;mall addition to the fare of pa&s;&s;engers between <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Conwy,</HI> will indemnify the coach from the lo&s;s by toll. Let Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> who cannot but be fertile in expedi|ents, con&s;ider of the matter. My earne&s;t wi&s;h is to have har|mony re&s;tored, and the &s;tronge&s;t mutual efforts made for the general good.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI><DATE><HI>January</HI> 23, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> two letters were laid by Mr. <HI>Smalley</HI> before the commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Flint, Holywell,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;tricts, &s;igned <HI>D. Smith,</HI> and <HI>G. Boulton;</HI> in which our attention was reque&s;ted to the repair of the roads which lay in our county in the cour&s;e of the mail. It falls to my lot to de&s;ire you to com|municate to your re&s;pectable corporation, what the commi&s;&s;ion|ers have done, and what they intend to do of their own proper motions, not from the fear of any of the very unbecoming me|naces &s;ent forth.</P>
<P>ON the road from <HI>Holywell</HI> to the extremity of the di&s;trict (which is called the <HI>Flint),</HI> has been laid out, within two years, 953l. in the &s;pace of five miles: great part of which, long be|fore the indictments, was in mo&s;t admirable repair.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict begins at the we&s;tern end of the <HI>Flint:</HI> much of it is in very good order: part is very indifferent, owing to the impoveri&s;hed &s;tate of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict, and to the in|ability of the poor inhabitants of the town&s;hip in which <HI>Rhiallt-hill</HI> lies, to repair that part, which is bad by nature. I propo&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription: you &s;ee my offer in the inclo&s;ed. We look up to the city of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as both are engaged in a common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Holywell</HI> di&s;trict is, excepting near <HI>Halkin,</HI> in excellent
<PB N="128" REF="133">repair. The part complained of will be attended to at the next meeting at <HI>Holywell,</HI> at eleven o'clock on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 8th of <HI>February.</HI> We &s;hall be happy to &s;ee any gentlemen on the part of your city.</P>
<P>EXCUSE me if I remind the city of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the county, and al&s;o the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> that our importance is &s;uch, that our de|mand of a mail is a matter of right; not a petition for favor. How &s;uperior is the ju&s;tice of our claim to that of <HI>Salop,</HI> which had long &s;ince its independent mail!</P>
<P>IN re&s;pect to my particular actings, I never will per&s;i&s;t in any thing that is wrong; nor de&s;i&s;t from any thing that is right. Our clame for aboli&s;hing the exemption from tolls is founded on common hone&s;ty. My &s;eizing on the guard was the act of an attentive magi&s;trate, to prevent future murders. Two, if not three, had been committed: one near <HI>Conwy;</HI> another in <HI>An|gle&s;ey:</HI> be&s;ides the terror &s;pread along the whole road by the wanton conduct of the profligate guards. I brought the affair before our quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ion; more to &s;et it in the true light than to puni&s;h the offender. I was a&s;per&s;ed in your city; but the examination wiped away the dirty paragraph.</P>

<P>I REQUEST you to lay before the public the following adverti&s;ement, addre&s;&s;ed by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> turnpike di&s;trict, in order to avert in future the hard&s;hips &s;eve|ral of the town&s;hips of the county of <HI>Flint</HI> labor under in the repairs of the roads. The adverti&s;ement it&s;elf relates to the greater part of the grievances. It was &s;ent to the paper too late to inform the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> circuits, but has been approved by the grand juries of <HI>Che&s;hire, Denbigh&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> at the Spring a&s;&s;izes, and by that of <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> being the Autumn a&s;&s;izes. Let me here inform you, that, by in|dictments from the General Po&s;t-Office, fines to the amount of 1200l. have been laid on the &s;everal town&s;hips lying in the cour&s;e of the po&s;t-roads in the little county of <HI>Flint,</HI> many of which are very &s;mall, and labour under the greate&s;t poverty. One in particular has a va&s;t extent of road to repair, and only a few labourers, and four mi&s;erable teams to perform their &s;tatute labor. Under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, terrified with the pro&s;pect of ruin, they performed twenty-two days &s;tatute duty. The French <HI>corv&eacute;es,</HI> now &s;o rea&s;onably aboli&s;hed, were introduced on Briti&s;h ground, yet in vain; for a fine of 82l. 10s. was im|po&s;ed on the poor people. So little intere&s;ted were they, and
<PB N="130" REF="135">numbers of others of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> town&s;hips, in the pa&s;&s;age of the mail-coach, that po&s;&s;ibly they do not receive a letter in a year; yet the&s;e town&s;hips mu&s;t &s;uffer equally with the mo&s;t opulent and commercial towns. Many of the roads were unexceptionably repaired; the re&s;t were in &s;ufficient repair for the u&s;es of the farmer, for the u&s;es of the gentlemen's carriages, and for the u&s;es of the mail, before the late unguarded innovations. We are, like the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> required to make brick without &s;traw. The means of repair are taken from us, and we are fined for not performing impo&s;&s;ibilities. A po&s;t-road is a national con|cern; that to a neighboring kingdom doubly &s;o: and certainly that con&s;ideration &s;hould induce legi&s;lature to afford an aid in &s;uch ca&s;es in which it is found nece&s;&s;ary; and if a road mu&s;t be fini&s;hed with finical perfection, the expence ought never to fall on tho&s;e who are totally unintere&s;ted in it. Ju&s;tice can never require that the poor &s;hould keep pace with the innovations made for the benefit of commerce or luxury. Much of the road-laws calls loudly for a reform: in all laws there &s;hould be a point of limitation. The attention of the grand juries is reque&s;ted at the en&s;uing a&s;&s;izes. It is hoped that they will direct their repre&s;entatives to make the mail-coaches liable to tolls. We mean no injury to Mr. <HI>Palmer:</HI> let him, before the meeting of parlement, &s;ugge&s;t any remedy for the evil, and we &s;hall re&s;t content. They will certainly do away the great parlementary opprobrium of the act pa&s;&s;ed by their pre|dece&s;&s;ors; which le&s;&s;ens a &s;ecurity granted on the faith of par|lement. And much more may be &s;aid on this &s;ubject; but the detail is re&s;erved for another occa&s;ion; you may be again
<PB N="131" REF="136">troubled with my complaints, as well as &s;ome account of a town&s;hip grievance, brought on it by tho&s;e who&s;e peculiar office it was to have guarded again&s;t the deceptions which im|po&s;ed on their judgment, and brought on a mo&s;t erroneous and di&s;graceful adjudication.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL TURNPIKE CONCERN.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AT a meeting of the tru&s;tees of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> turnpike, held at the hou&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph Roberts,</HI> at the <HI>Blue Bell,</HI> on <HI>Saturday, July</HI> 30, 1791, the &s;tate of the roads was taken into con|&s;ideration:</P>
<P N="2">2. WHEN it appeared, that parts of the coal-road were greatly out of repair; the trade in which was the original foun|dation of this turnpike.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT the pre&s;ent annual tolls are very inadequate to remedy the evil.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT the failure of the tolls does not ari&s;e from any decay of trade in the country, but from the exemption granted by parliament, by the 25th <HI>Geo.</HI> III. c. 57, to the mail-coaches from the payment of any tolls.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT, by &s;uch exemption, the common &s;tage-coaches have been obliged to de&s;i&s;t from travelling, by rea&s;on of the burthen they are &s;ingly to &s;u&s;tain, and which the mail-coaches are freed from, and now in many places monopolize the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. THAT the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict alone &s;uffers a lo&s;s of 40l. a year, which is the intere&s;t of 800l. the lo&s;s of which prevents the tru&s;tees from the repairing of road equal to the expenditure of &s;uch a &s;um.</P>
<P N="7">7. THAT the clau&s;e of exemption in favor of the mail-coaches
<PB N="133" REF="138">is highly detrimental to the credit of the tolls, and the fecurity of the lenders, who had lent their money under the pledge of parliamentary faith.</P>
<P N="8">8. ORDERED, That the expediency of petitioning parliament on this &s;ubject be farther taken into con&s;ideration, and that the&s;e re&s;olutions be publi&s;hed in the next <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> paper, as they are public concerns; every po&s;t-road, and its &s;everal creditors, be|ing intere&s;ted therein.</P>
<P N="9">9. THAT the &s;um of ten guineas be paid into the hands of the &s;olicitor, towards the expences of the propo&s;ed bill, for re|pealing the exemption of tolls of the mail-coaches, and for &s;ub|jecting them to tolls, in ca&s;e &s;uch bill be brought into parlia|ment: and that the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;everal turnpike di&s;|tricts in <HI>Great Britain</HI> be invited to corre&s;pond, by their trea|&s;urers, on the &s;ubject, with <HI>Samuel Small,</HI> trea&s;urer of the <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Holywell</HI> di&s;tricts, and <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tant trea&s;urer of that of <HI>Mo&s;tyn.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. THAT the thanks of the commi&s;&s;ioners be given to the foremen and grand juries of the counties of <HI>Che&s;hire, Denbigh|&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> for their liberal concurrence with the re&s;olu|tions of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict.</P>
<P N="11">11. THAT it is reque&s;ted of the gentlemen of this county to attend at <HI>Mold,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 9th of <HI>April,</HI> to give a &s;anction to this propo&s;al, and to prepare one or more petitions, or to give nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction to the repre&s;enta|tives of the county and borough, &amp;c. as may then be thought proper.</P>
<P N="12">12. AND, in order to give force to this rea&s;onable clame
<PB N="134" REF="139">on parliament, it is recommended to the gentlemen of neigh|boring counties, who may attend the duty of their country on the en&s;uing grand juries, to take the above into con&s;ideration, and add their weight to the common cau&s;e.</P>

<P>IN THE COUNTY OF FLINT, Held at the <HI>Antelope,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Holywell,</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 20th day of <HI>December,</HI> 1792;</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly,</HI></P>
<P>THAT it is the opinion of this meeting, that a&s;&s;ociations of all per&s;ons enjoying the unexampled benefits of the happy and envied con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> are at this time highly expedient and nece&s;&s;ary, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pre&s;erving the e&s;tabli&s;hed liberties and growing pro&s;perity of our country.</P>
<P>We do therefore a&s;&s;ociate our&s;elves;&mdash;and do profe&s;s and de|clare our unalienable attachment to the Con&s;titution, our firm and inviolable allegiance to our gracious Sovereign, under who&s;e mild and beneficent reign we po&s;&s;e&s;s all the advantages of good
<PB N="138" REF="143">government; our obedience to the laws, and our anxious wi&s;hes for peace and good order in &s;ociety, which it is our determined re&s;olution to u&s;e all our exertions to pre&s;erve; and we do expre&s;s our abhorrence of every attempt made to deprive us of the in|valuable ble&s;&s;ings we now enjoy.</P>
<P>Thus a&s;&s;ociated, we feel it our duty to point out, and we re|que&s;t all orders of men in this country to reflect on, the ine&s;ti|mable benefits of our excellent con&s;titution.</P>
<P>We are governed by known laws, that are ju&s;t and equal, and re&s;pect not per&s;ons; they alike re&s;train oppre&s;&s;ion and curb licentiou&s;ne&s;s: <HI>The highe&s;t</HI> (as hath been well ob&s;erved) <HI>are within their reach, and the lowe&s;t have their full protection.</HI></P>
<P>All the arts, farming, manufactures, trade, and every employ|ment and labour of man, are encouraged, and flouri&s;h beyond any thing known in any former period, or in any country; every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in &s;ecurity the fruit of his labour. Talents and in|du&s;try are &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, and may, as we daily &s;ee, ri&s;e to wealth and honor.</P>
<P>We enjoy, and have long enjoyed, the perfection of civil liberty in our per&s;ons, our property, and our hone&s;t opinions: and it is the glory of <HI>Britain,</HI> that of all the nations of <HI>Europe&mdash;HERE ONLY ALL MEN ARE FREE.</HI></P>
<P>It is then our duty, and we &s;olemnly pledge our&s;elves, collec|tively and individually, to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavors to pre&s;erve the&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, by a firm and zealous attachment to our King and Con&s;titution, a ready and &s;trenuous &s;upport of the magi&s;tracy, and the mo&s;t active and unremitted vigilance to &s;up|pre&s;s and prevent all tumult, di&s;order, and &s;editious meetings and publications.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="144"><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the thanks of this meeting be given to THO|MAS PENNANT, E&s;q. chairman, for his activity and zeal in pro|moting this bu&s;ine&s;s, and his ready acceptance of the chair.</P>
