Of cour&s;e, our religion has been the &s;ame from the beginning of the world. Men have ever acknowledged the &s;ame God as the Creator, and the &s;ame Chri&s;t as the Saviour of the world. But this ac|knowledgment was not &s;ufficient to &s;ave mankind before the coming of our Saviour. Men found it nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e <HI>natural</HI> religion, before the introduction of <HI>revealed;</HI> that is to &s;ay, to &s;ubmit to the principles of right and equity, which God had engraved upon their hearts, before he thought proper to give them any di|rections on that head. They did as they would be done by, and acted in conformity to con&s;cience and to rea&s;on. Such was the religion of Adam and his po&s;terity. To render it however more venerable, and te&s;tify their de|pendance on the &s;overeign maje&s;ty of God, they made u&s;e of ceremonies, and an outward form of wor&s;hip; they
<PB N="2" REF="7">erected altars and &s;acrificed, on tho&s;e altars, certain ani|mals and fruits of the earth, as emblematical of the great &s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in after-times. <HI>Then</HI> the di&s;tinction of prie&s;t and people was unknown.

<HEAD>THE FIRST EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t then of the &s;ix epochs or periods is that, which begins with the world and ends with the deluge,
<PB N="3" REF="8">and comprehends the occurrences of 1656 years, that is to &s;ay, from Adam to Noah.</P>
<P>Not long after the fall of our fir&s;t parents they had two &s;ons, CAIN and ABEL. The di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e two brothers were of a contrary ca&s;t. Cain was of an ava|ricious, proud, impious turn of mind, whereas Abel was all meekne&s;s, humility and genero&s;ity; now as the &s;a|crifices, or homage offered to God, by the one, was more acceptable to him, than tho&s;e of the other, it occa&s;ioned &s;uch a jealou&s;y and hatred in Cain, that he &s;ought an opportunity to murder his brother.</P>
<P>The death of Abel armed the vengeance of the Lord again&s;t his murderer, and God to puni&s;h him, gave him over to the bittere&s;t remor&s;e. A man's con&s;cience, when keen, is a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for almo&s;t any crime. To this con&s;cience Cain was committed, and we are told that his &s;in &s;o afflicted him, that it was <Q>more than he was able to bear.</Q> He was driven out from &s;ociety, and thus agitated by his fears, &s;at about building the fir&s;t city, as an a&s;ylum from the hatred and per&s;ecution of mankind.</P>
<P>Adam was con&s;oled for the lo&s;s of Abel and the de|pravity of Cain by the birth of Seth, who was the &s;e|cond patriarch, or head of a family, before the de|luge.</P>
<P>The family of this man was virtuous and religious, whil&s;t that of Cain was the contrary; and it was not till the time of Enos, the third patriarch and &s;on of Seth, that the true wor&s;hip of God took place in the family of Cain. This was about 325 years after the creation.</P>
<P>The great great-grand&s;on of Enos, was Enoch the father of Methu&s;elah, he who was the longe&s;t liver, and died at the age of 969. This Enoch was taken up into heaven in a miraculous manner, &s;oon after the death of Adam, who dying, at the age of 930, plunged mankind into a general nourning.</P>
<P>The death of Adam, the taking up of Enoch, and the old age of the other patriarchs, who till now, &s;eemed to have kept men within certain bounds, gave a loo&s;e to univer&s;al corruption. Nothing could check it.
<PB N="4" REF="9">The virtuous fell in with the depravity of the vicious; in a word, impiety grew to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that God, in equity of judgment, determined to extirpate this criminal race of men from the earth.</P>
<P>Among the whole there was only one good man. This was the patriarch Noah, the grand&s;on of Methu|&s;aleh and of the tenth generation from Adam, by his &s;on Seth: him God was plea&s;ed to favour and reveal to his de&s;ign of de&s;troying the world by an univer&s;al deluge, and that 120 years before it happened. In order to &s;ave this man and his family, he directed him to build a large ve&s;&s;el, which we call an <HI>Ark.</HI></P>
<P>During this interval, Noah denounced to &s;inners the terrible event that threatened them; but, they &s;hut their ears to his &s;alutary admonitions, and laughed at the dreadful account he held forth to them, till the horrible event took place. Noah alone, his wife, his three &s;ons and their wives, with a male and female of every animal then living were re&s;erved to re-people and re-&s;tock the earth. This happened in the year of the world 1656, when Noah was about 600 years old.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard the long lives of people living before the flood di&s;puted, and that that which we call a year, was a period of much &s;horter duration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such things <HI>have</HI> been advanced, but merely on conjecture. In the early ages of the world, when fa|milies on the earth were few, it was perhaps nece&s;&s;ary, or at lea&s;t not attended with any inconvenience, that men &s;hould live and beget children for eight or nine hundred years, in order to people the globe; but, was mankind to live now as long, it is evident from the po|pulou&s;ne&s;s of every country, that the earth would be over-&s;tocked, and not large enough to provide for man|kind. On this account, Providence has wi&s;ely &s;hortened our days and ordered that, there &s;hall be no more inha|bitants than the earth is capable of maintaining. Be|&s;ides, God might then have thought proper to extend the lives of men to a very great age, in order to hand down to po&s;terity the wonders of his power and his
<PB N="5" REF="10">goodne&s;s, which, as printing was then unknown, could not be otherwi&s;e done than by tradition.</P>
<P>The ten patriarchs, that lived before the flood, namely, Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methu&s;elah, Lamech, and Noah, (each of which was the &s;on of the per&s;on preceding him.) were the de|po&s;itaries of the holy law, before it was publi&s;hed on Mount Sinai; and of the&s;e ten, Adam lived 56 years after Lamech was born, and Lamech lived till Noah was 595 years old, that is, till within &s;ix years of the deluge; and as Noah lived 350 years afterwards, it is plain, that the hi&s;tory of above 2000 years was within the memory of three per&s;ons; the accounts given therefore by the&s;e three men, corroborating the a&s;&s;ertions of the other &s;even patriarchs, leave no room to doubt the ve|racity of their traditions.</P>
<P>So again of the ten patriarchs after the flood. Shem, the fir&s;t patriarch, the &s;on of Noah, lived 150 years after the birth of Abraham the tenth patriarch, who&s;e &s;on I&s;aac was a cotemporay to Levi, the father, or grand|father of Mo&s;es. Hence it follows, that Mo&s;es wrote nothing but that was in the memory of man; &s;ince he was not more than four or five generations removed from Abraham; and, Abraham being alive with many who had &s;een Noah and the deluge, and Noah with many that had &s;een Adam and the fir&s;t ages of the world; it follows, that Adam could not be unknown to Noah and his &s;on Shem, nor the&s;e, to Abraham or Jacob; nor Jacob to Mo&s;es; particularly at a time, when this tra|dition concerned their own family, and was the only hi&s;|tory fathers could teach their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have followed you, Sir, with attention, and &s;ee clearly that the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t ages of the world, have pa&s;&s;ed through too few hands to be altered, in the days of Mo&s;es; not more than &s;even or eight per|&s;ons from Adams to Mo&s;es, a period of near 2500 years. &mdash;But, Sir, there is a new difficulty which &s;trikes me, and which I wi&s;h to have cleared up, and that is how &s;o great a multitude of animals, as two of each &s;pecies, which covered the earth, could be contained in the ark,
<PB N="6" REF="11">&s;o long as a year; which I under&s;tand the deluge conti|nued!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that, according to the dimen&s;ions of the ark given us in &s;crip|ture, it was four times as large as a fir&s;t-rate man of war, which is capable of containing &s;even or eight hundred men, with as many troops, with nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for &s;ix months, and at the &s;ame time loaded with rigging, one hundred pieces of heavy cannon, and their proper ammunition; whereas, in the ark, were only eight per|&s;ons, be&s;ides the animals and their provi&s;ions for a year.</P>
<P>In the next place, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that the ori|ginal &s;pecies of animals were not &s;o numerous as have been thought. All the &s;pecies of dogs, for example, may have ari&s;en from one &s;pecies, as all the &s;pecies of pears may have &s;prung from the fir&s;t pear-tree; or the different &s;pecies of men from the &s;ame original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, is it natural to conclude that men of different complexions, white, &s;warthy, copper-colour|ed and black, &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Our exterior varieties are &s;ubject to change. We no way re&s;emble the ancient Britons of this country. This race of people has cea&s;ed by mixing with others. The Arabians, who lived a long time in Spain, and who were originally of a black ca&s;t, have now retired to Morocco and Tunis. The natives of the we&s;tern part of Africa are <HI>blacker</HI> than they formerly were, tho&s;e about Tunis <HI>whiter.</HI> Where there is no mix|ture of people, the &s;ame colour has continued, but one alteration is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy our conclu&s;ions, that men of different complexions <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;pring from different &s;tocks.</P>
<P>No animal produced by two animals of a different kind, ever breeds: that is, mongrels never perpetuate their &s;pecies; but, a bitch produced by a greyhound and a terrier will have young; of cour&s;e, a greyhound and a terrier are, in fact, of the &s;ame &s;pecies; we may &s;ay the &s;ame of a child born of a negro-woman and a white man. But let us continue the hi&s;tory of religion.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P>Soon after the deluge, change of living, and <HI>animal</HI> food being &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of <HI>vegetable,</HI> with other cau&s;es, brought on a decrea&s;e in length of life. Some precepts were given to Noah; the confu&s;ion of tongues happened at the tower of Babel in the year of the world 1878, which was the fir&s;t monument of the pride and wickedne&s;s of men; and the allotment of di&s;trict to the three children of Noah, was the fir&s;t di&s;tribution of land.</P>
<P>An account of the&s;e fir&s;t three founders of nations is &s;till pre&s;erved. From Japhet, the elde&s;t &s;on of Noah, &s;prung the inhabitants of the north of Europe and A&s;ia, as well as tho&s;e of the we&s;t; from Shem came the people of the ea&s;t, as al&s;o the Jews; and, from Ham and his &s;on Canaan, de&s;cended the Canaanites, Phili&s;tines, Egypti|ans, and the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Africa.</P>
<P>A little after this fir&s;t divi&s;ion of territory, that is about 1879 of the world, Nimrod, a man of &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition, became the fir&s;t of conquerors, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his king|dom at Babylon. He was the father of Ninus, who found|ed the A&s;&s;yrian monarchy.</P>
<P>Every thing had a beginning; there is no hi&s;tory &s;o an|cient that has not ve&s;tiges of the infancy of the world. We have &s;een laws e&s;tabli&s;hed, manners become poli&s;hed, and empires formed; men have ri&s;en by degrees from a &s;tate of ignorance; experience has improved them, and arts have multiplied and grown to perfection under their hands. In proportion as mankind encrea&s;ed, mountains were pa&s;&s;ed, rivers and &s;eas were traver&s;ed, and new ha|bitations were e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The earth, which in the beginning was merely an im|men&s;e fore&s;t, took on a new form. Woods grubbed up, gave place to fields, to meadows, to villages and towns; men employed them&s;elves in taking animals, taming them and making them u&s;eful. Meeting with oppo&s;ition they fir&s;t began their conte&s;t with wild bea&s;ts. They next invented arms, then turned tho&s;e arms again&s;t each other, and took pride in war. Nimrod, the fir&s;t war|rior and the fir&s;t conqueror, is called in &s;cripture, <Q>A
<PB N="8" REF="13">great hunter.</Q> Afterwards, men found out the art of cultivation; converted metals to their u&s;e, and turned every article in nature to &s;ome advantage.</P>
<P>But though men enriched &s;ociety by the invention and improvement of arts, they on the other hand di&s;honoured it by the greate&s;t exce&s;&s;es, till in the end, they drew upon them the vengeance of the Lord. In vain did the world, &s;till dripping as it were, with the waters of the deluge, in vain did the &s;triking decrea&s;e in the duration of human life, in vain did the overthrow of nature, &s;till pre&s;ent dreadful monuments of the ju&s;tice of an irritated Creator. The knowledge of a Supreme Being was effa|ced from the memory of man; ancient traditions were ob&s;cured and forgotten, and fables took their place. In&s;tead of paying that tribute of adoration to the <HI>Mo&s;t-High</HI> which was due from all that breathed. they pro&s;ti|tuted a &s;acrilegious incen&s;e to animals, and by an in|conceivable depravity, even kings fell down before them and wor&s;hipped them. Scarce was found a family faith|ful to the God of Adam and of Noah; in&s;omuch, that the Father of nature, weary of threatning, waiting, and puni&s;hing, abandoned mankind and left them to their perver&s;ene&s;s.&mdash;Such was the unhappy progre&s;s of &s;in in the &s;hort &s;pace of 426 years, the duration of this &s;econd epoch.</P>

<HEAD>THE THIRD EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e crimes which &s;ullied the world, God, ever watchful for the pre&s;ervation of religion, perceived one ju&s;t man of the family of Shem, and
<PB N="9" REF="14">through him determined to &s;eparate the true wor&s;hippers, from the re&s;t of mankind. This was Abraham, and he was cho&s;en to be the &s;tock and father of the faithful. This was in the year of the world 2108.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;t-High called him into a country inhabited by the po&s;terity of Canaan, determining to e&s;tabli&s;h there his wor&s;hip and the children of this patriarch, whom he had re&s;olved to multiply as the &s;tars of heaven and as the &s;and of the &s;ea. To the promi&s;e he made him of giving this land to his de&s;cendants, he added a more illu&s;trious good, namely, that great ble&s;&s;ing he be&s;towed through him on all the human race; for, of Abraham's family Je&s;us Chri&s;t was born.</P>
<P>From Jacob, the grand&s;on, of Abraham, and whom I&s;aac his father ble&s;&s;ed in preference to his elder brother E&s;au, (thus executing the will of God, though he was apparently deceived into it) &s;prang the I&s;raelites or Jews, &s;o called from <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the name given him from his wre&s;tling with an angel, in the year of the world 2296.</P>
<P>After the death of Jacob, (who&s;e &s;on Jo&s;eph had made &s;uch a figure in the court of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and the admini&s;tration of his government,) the hou&s;e of Abraham became a great people, and multiplied &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, as to excite the jealou&s;y of the Egyptians. The I&s;raelites or Hebrews faithful to their God, were in the very centre of the mo&s;t mon&s;trous and ab&s;urd ido|latry, unju&s;tly hated, and unmercifully per&s;ecuted. But the Lord rai&s;ed up Mo&s;es as their protector and de|liverer; having &s;aved him from the waters of the Nile, where, by an order of the king, all the male children of the I&s;raelites were thrown, with a de&s;ign to defeat a prophecy, that one &s;hould then be born, that &s;hould re&s;cue the I&s;raelites from their &s;ervitude. From the waters of the Nile, to which Mo&s;es, then an infant, was committed, in the year of the world 2464, he fell under the notice of Pharaoh's daughter, there walking, who re&s;cued him from a watery grave, and brought him up as her own &s;on.</P>
<P>For forty years, Mo&s;es de&s;pi&s;ed the riches of the court of Egypt; and, moved with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his brother
<PB N="10" REF="15">I&s;raelites, whom Pharaoh continued to per&s;ecute, com|bated every danger to comfort them. But they, far from profiting by his zeal and his re&s;olution, expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the fury of Pharaoh, who was determined on their ruin. Mo&s;es &s;aved him&s;elf by flight; he fled into Arabia, where he pa&s;&s;ed forty years as a &s;hepherd; at the end of which time, he &s;aw the burning bu&s;h, from the mid&s;t of which God &s;pake to him and directed him to return to Egypt, and free his brethren from their &s;lavery.</P>
<P>The pains he took to effect this, his remon&s;trances with Pharaoh, his puni&s;hment of that king, by bringing on his country the many plagues it endured, his con|ducting the I&s;raelites acro&s;s the red &s;ea, where the water miraculou&s;ly divided to the right and left, to &s;uffer them to pa&s;s through and united again, to drown Pharaoh and all his ho&s;t, attempting to follow them, in order to force them back, you are too well acquainted with, to need a repetition here. All that is nece&s;&s;ary to know is, that Mo&s;es through the interference of God, became the de|liverer of the Jewi&s;h nation, after more than two ages of &s;ervitude, and 430 years after the calling of Abra|ham. This was in the year of the world 2544; or, 1510 years before the birth of Chri&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE FOURTH EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P>God having freed his people from the tyranny of the Egyptians, to conduct them to a land which he had pro|mi&s;ed to their father, laid down the law which he would have them to follow.</P>
<P>In the journey of the&s;e I&s;raelites (in number 600,000, be&s;ides old men, women and children) God provided for them miraculou&s;ly; he rained down manna, a kind of bread, from Heaven, and water gu&s;hed out from rocks, at the command of their leader; nor did their cloaths wear out, but fitted them and their children during their whole journey, which took up the &s;pace of forty years.</P>
<P>They no &s;ooner had pa&s;&s;ed the red &s;ea, and were free from the pur&s;uit of the Egyptians, than God directed Mo&s;es to a&s;cend Mount Sinai occa&s;ionally, (the I&s;raelites continuing at the foot of it,)where he delivered into his
<PB N="11" REF="16">hands two tables of &s;tone, on which he had engraved the decalogue, or ten commandments; and, at times, gave him &s;uch other in&s;tructions as he thought nece&s;&s;ary. This decalogue was by no means a new law, but that which God had written in the hearts of all men, long before; it containing only the fir&s;t principles of man's duty to God and to his neighbour. His renewal of this law, and giving it in writing was becau&s;e the ignorance and pa&s;&s;i|ons of men had almo&s;t effaced it from their memory. In one of his vi&s;its to the top of Sinai he continued forty days, during which the I&s;raelites murmured, and fancy|ing Mo&s;es had de&s;erted them, made a golden calf and fell down and wor&s;hipped it. Mo&s;es, on his return, to puni&s;h the guilty, called the children of Levi and ordered them to put the idolaters to death, which they did to the number of three thou&s;and.</P>
<P>After God had delivered the commandments to Mo&s;es, he gave him other precepts, which he was to con&s;ider as an explanation of the written law. He ordered him to build a temple or tabernacle to depo&s;it this law in; to erect an altar and &s;tabli&s;h a prie&s;thood. To this office Mo&s;es appointed his brother Aaron. Thus did God e&s;ta|bli&s;h ceremonies and an outward form of wor&s;hip, and the Levites, the grand-children of Jacob by their father Levi, were con&s;ecrated to &s;erve at the altars.</P>
<P>After the&s;e great e&s;tabli&s;hments they pur&s;ued their jour|ney into the de&s;arts of Arabia. Before the completion of which Mo&s;es died, and God appointed Jo&s;hua his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who ordered this hi&s;tory, which Mo&s;es had begun, to be continued.</P>

<P>HAVING given you, my dear Eugenius, &s;ome account of Sacred Hi&s;tory, I will now endeavour to give you &s;ome light into that of our own country.</P>

<P>The Hi&s;tory of England may be divided into three periods. The fir&s;t from the commencement of our knowledge of this country to it's conque&s;t by the Normans; the &s;econd, from that conque&s;t to the alteration of the con|&s;titution, by the beheading of King Charles; and the la&s;t, from King Charles's death to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Before the Romans entered this i&s;land, which was fifty four years before the birth of Chri&s;t, the country was po|pulous, and &s;tored with great plenty of animals, &s;avage and dome&s;tic. Towns were few and hou&s;e were meanly built and &s;cattered up and down. The ancient Britons lived upon milk and fle&s;h, procured by hunting, and went al|mo&s;t naked, painting their bodies with different colours; the only garments they wore were the &s;kins of bea&s;ts thrown over their &s;houlders, and another round their wai&s;ts.</P>

<P>What government they had, con&s;i&s;ted of petty principalities, who united in ca&s;es of common danger, and cho&s;e a leader by general con&s;ent. In &s;hort, the people were little better than &s;avages.</P>

<P>They had a fraternity among them known by the name of Druids, who were maje&s;trates as well as prie&s;ts, and who taught a morality which principally con&s;i&s;ited in ju&s;|tice
<PB N="19" REF="24"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce and fortitude; they lived in woods and caverns and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollow trees, and their food was acorns and wild berries. It was in the &s;pirit of conque&s;t that Julius Cae&s;ar invaded his country, from Gaul, (now France) in order to add it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Roman territories. He appeared off the coa&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;&s;ex, and though the Britons made the brave&s;t opo&s;ition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade good his landing and in a very littel time completed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is conque&s;t; for the Briti&s;h forces laid down their arms and acknowledged the Roman power. Julius Cae&s;ar made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o long &s;tay in this i&s;land, but, having laid the Britons un|der tribute, returned to Gaul.</P>
<P>The &s;econd expedition of the Romans into Britain, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ander Claudius, in the year 50. Caractacus their King, made a brave defence, but was at la&s;t defeated and taken pri&s;oner. From this time the Romans continued in Britain and mixed with the natives; but their troubles at home obliging the Roman emperor to call back his forces from this country, in the year 410, the Britons were once more le&s;t to them&s;elves; and &s;uch were the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of this people among them&s;elves, that forty years afterwards they were driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to the Romans for re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ief again&s;t the inroads of the Picts and Scots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who were the&s;e Picts?.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were part of the natives of Britain, who had been driven by the Romans into the North of England, and who were always ravaging the Southern parts, whenever they had an opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the Romans afford them any &s;uccour?.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>None; they were too much engaged in quieting ho&s;tilities in their own country, to think of a people at &s;o great a di&s;tance; the con&s;equence of which was, that the Britons invited over the Saxons who were then &s;ettled in Germany.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were the Saxons as &s;avage as the Britons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; the Saxons were a more poli&s;hed peo|ple, but not &s;o refined as the Romans, and they dre&s;&s;ed with a degree of elegance.&mdash;The women wore linen gar|ments trimmed and &s;triped with purple, and their hair fell in ringlets on their &s;houlders; no part of their bodies was
<PB N="20" REF="25">expo&s;ed to the weather but their faces, their arms and their bo&s;oms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the Saxons come over?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>On this invitation in the year 449, great numbers came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Britons, with Hen|gift and Hor&s;a, two brothers, at their head. They marched in conjunction with the Briti&s;h arms again&s;t the Picts, and obliged them to retire into Scotland; and, finding them|&s;elves very powerful, &s;ent over for more forces, turned their arms upon the Britons, and in one century &s;ubdued all England, and e&s;tabli&s;hed here &s;even different kindgoms, known by the name of the Saxon <HI>Heptarchy.</HI> This took place about 548.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What became of the Britons after this?.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many went over to France, and &s;ettled in that part now called <HI>Britany;</HI> many of the fell in a variety of engagements; many were ma&s;&s;acred, and the few of &s;pirit that remained to e&s;cape the fury of their conquerors, retired to the mountainous parts of Wales and Cornwall. Such as cho&s;e to continue among the Saxons, became &s;laves to this people; turning their hands to agriculture, and holding their lands at the will and plea&s;ure of their landlords. The children of the&s;e mi&s;erable Britons, be|longed to the &s;oil they tilled, like the re&s;t of the &s;tock or cattle on it, and were the property of their owners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pre&s;ame this is what is under&s;tood by <HI>Villenage?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. A horrid cu&s;tom, originally borrowed from the Romans, and adopted by the Saxons by vicious imitation.</P>
<P>The Saxons now finding no enemies to &s;ubdue, began to fight with each other. The princes of the &s;even king|doms which they had erected, namely, <HI>Kent, South, We&s;t</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t Saxony, Northumberland, Ea&s;t Angles</HI> and <HI>Mer|cia,</HI> began mutually to rival and envy each other, and for the &s;pace of above 200 years, all the mi&s;ery that ambi|tion, treachery, or war could bring upon a kingdom, was the con&s;equence of their animo&s;ity; till, at la&s;t, in the year 800, Egbert, de&s;cended from the We&s;t Saxon kings, partly by conque&s;t, and partly by inheritance, became
<PB N="21" REF="26"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fir&s;t &s;ole monarch of England, the &s;even kingdoms be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in him united into one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was called England then at that time?.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It then fir&s;t took this name, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the principality of Wales, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the an|cient Britons, and from that part now called Scotland, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Picts and Scots.</P>
<P>No cu&s;toms, truly Briti&s;h or Roman, were now to be &s;een. The language of the country, which had been either Latin or Celtic, was di&s;continued, and the Saxon, that is Engli&s;h, only was &s;poken. The kingdom was di|vided into counties or &s;hires, and the Engli&s;h, if com|pared to the naked Britons at the inva&s;ion of Cae&s;ar, might be con&s;idered as polite. Hou&s;es, furniture, cloaths and other luxuries were as general then as at pre&s;ent. They were only incapable of &s;entimental plea&s;ure; all the learning of the times was centred in the clergy, who were over-run with ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, I pre&s;ume, had not found a footing here?</P>
<P>Au&s;tin, the monk, had been &s;ent over by the Pope, in 597, in order to preach chri&s;tianity, and was made the fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. He made many converts, but this little improved their manners.</P>
<P>Egbert was &s;carce &s;ettled on his throne, than the whole kingdom was alarmed by the approach of an unexpected enemy. A &s;warm of tho&s;e nations that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the countries bordering on the Baltic, began, under the names of Danes and Normans, to infe&s;t the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Europe, plundering tho&s;e very people who, &s;ome centuries before, had invaded the places where they were now &s;et|tled, and driven out the inhabitants. The Normans fell upon the Northern coa&s;ts of France; the Danes, on the Southern parts of England.</P>
<P>A. D. 832. The people of this i&s;land had been too much exhau&s;ted in civil war to make much oppo&s;ition. Some battles were fought, but the Danes kept their foot|ing, fortified po&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ages, and built ca&s;tles for their defence; of which there are many remains at this day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did the Saxons reli&s;h this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="27">
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Danes and Saxons were originally from the &s;ame country, of cour&s;e their &s;imilitude of language, laws and manners, &s;oon produced an intercour&s;e between both nations; and though they were &s;till enemies, the Danes gradually mingled with the people of England, and &s;ubmitted to it's government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were they of the &s;ame religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The Engli&s;h were chri&s;tians, and the Danes, Pagans; of cour&s;e, though the Engli&s;h in &s;ome mea&s;ure admitted them, yet they &s;ecretly hated them; this produced frequent conten&s;ts, and frequently laid the country in blood.</P>
<P>In this period of cruelty, jealou&s;y and de&s;olation; a man &s;eemed rai&s;ed up to defend the rights of his bleeding coun|try, and improve the age in which he lived. This was Alfred, the fourth &s;on of Ethelwolf, king of England, and grand&s;on of Egbert, who, on the death of his brother Ethelred, was called to the Engli&s;h crown, of which he was put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion only nominally, the country being over-run by the Danes.</P>
<P>His reign began with wars, and his fir&s;t battles were fought with &s;uccee&s;s; but, being at length overpowered, he was obliged to &s;ave him&s;elf by flight. He retired to the cottage of a cow-herd, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and lived &s;ix months there, as a &s;ervant; no one being privy to this re|treat of his but his friend the Earl of Devon&s;hire.</P>

<P>His natural &s;on Athel&s;tan, in 924, under who&s;e au&s;pices the bible was tran&s;lated into Saxon, and the thri&s;tian religion gained ground. His &s;on, Edmund the fir&s;t, was his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in 941; who&s;e reign is no otherwi&s;e re|markable, than by his in&s;tituting the fir&s;t capital puni&s;hment, having ordained that, in gangs of robbers, when taken, the olde&s;t &s;hould be hanged. He lo&s;t his life in a very extra|ordinary manner, after a reign of &s;even years. Solemniz|ing a fe&s;tival, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and ob&s;erving a fellow, who had been bani&s;hed the kingdom for his crimes, fitting at one of the tables in the hall where he dined; he was &s;o offended at his in&s;olence, that he ordered him to be appre|hended; and, perceiving the villain drawing a dagger, in order to defend him&s;elf, the king &s;tarted up, and, catching him by the hair, dragged him our of the hall; but, in doing this he met his death, for the ruffian, in the &s;cuffle, &s;tab|bed him to the heart.</P>
<P>Edred, his brother, &s;ucceeded him, and was &s;o weak a prince, that under him the monks gained great influence, and had the chief direction of affairs. He died in 955; left &s;everal &s;ons, but being very young they were &s;et a&s;ide, and Edwy, his elde&s;t brother's &s;on, was placed on the throne. At this time, the crown appears to have been elective, and tho&s;e elections wholly influenced by the cler|gy.

<P>She was the daughter of the Earl of Devon|&s;hire, and Edgar, unwilling to credit the great report of her beauty, &s;ent Ethelwolfe, a friend to &s;ee her that he might be better &s;atisfied, de&s;igning, if report &s;poke truth, to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her. This friend no &s;ooner &s;aw her than he became de&s;perately in love with her, and forgetting his errand, made propo&s;als to her him&s;elf; his hand was ac|cepted and they were privately married: returning, how|ever, to court and a&s;&s;uring the king, that &s;he was &s;o far from hand&s;ome that he wondered the world could &s;peak of her, Edgar thought no more of her. Sometime afterwards he repre&s;ented to the king, that though the fortune of the Earl of Devon&s;hire's daughter would be trifting to a monarch, yet it would be an immen&s;e &s;um to a needy &s;ubject, and &s;o|licited his permi&s;&s;ion to pay his court to her. Edgar con|&s;enting, Ethelwolfe returned to his wife, and their nupti|als were publickly &s;olemnized.

<P>Though good fortune &s;eemed to mark his reign thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, the decline of it was interrupted with dome&s;tic quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|els.

<P>William did not live many years after this, he invaded France in the year 1088, with an Engli&s;h army, and leaping a ditch, the pummel of his &s;addle hurt him, and occa&s;ioned a rupture, of which he died, leaving to his &s;on Robert the dukedom of Normandy, and the crown of England, to his &s;on William.</P>
<P>William II. on a&s;cending the Engli&s;h throne, had two very powerful parties to oppo&s;e; the nobility, who &s;till a&s;pired to the &s;ame freedom they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the Saxon kings, and the clergy, who wi&s;hed to erect them&s;elves into a di&s;tinct government.</P>
<P>Odo, his own uncle, took upon him to di&s;pute his title, and being &s;upported in this by his brother Robert, Wil|liam waged war with Robert, and carried it on with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s. Henry, the third brother, was al&s;o involved in this war, having taken up arms for not being

Bare-headed and bare-footed, therefore, in the &s;pirit of &s;u|per&s;tition, he travelled from court to court, preaching as he went, and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people. Pope Urban II. him&s;elf preached the nece&s;&s;ity of this holy war, and numberle&s;s per&s;ons of all degrees and na|tions ardently embraced the cau&s;e, and put on the red|cro&s;s, the badge of their profe&s;&s;ion. Among this number was Robert, duke of Normandy. In order to &s;upply money for this expen&s;ive undertaking, he offered to mortgage his dukedom to his brother William, for a &s;ti|pulated &s;um. William, eagerly embraced the propo&s;al. He rai&s;ed the money upon the clergy of this kingdom, and when his brother was gone, took peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dukedom.</P>

<P>There were now two competitors for the Throne, Robert, who was engaged in the holy war, and Henry the younge&s;t brother, who remained at home. Henry, however, took po&s;&s;e&s;ion of it, and endeavoured to &s;ecure that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by gaining the affections of the people. He therefore once more confirmed the Saxon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aws, and indulged the clergy, in all their former privi|leges.</P>
<P>On Robert's return from the holy land, where he re|fu&s;ed to be crowned king of Jeru&s;alem, he found him&s;elf deprived of a kingdom, which, as elder brother to Wil|liam, he con&s;idered as his birth-right. He could not, however, recover it, nor his dukedom of Normandy; but in his attempt was taken pri&s;oner, and confined twen|ty &s;ix years in Cardiff-ca&s;tle, in Wales, where he died.</P>
<P>To defend his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Normandy, Henry was obliged to wage war with France, and during one of the engagements a French cavalier per&s;onally attacked the king, and &s;truck him twice on the head, with &s;uch force that all his armour &s;treamed with blood. Henry, however, no way intimidated, continued the &s;ingle combat with re|&s;olution, and, &s;ummoning all his &s;trength, levelled &s;uch a blow at his antagoni&s;t as threw him from his hor&s;e, and the king took him pri&s;oner. This decided the victory, in favour of the Engli&s;h, and ha&s;tened a peace.</P>
<P>Henry now returning victorious from abroad, brought with him a numerous retinue of the nobility. In one of the ve&s;&s;els of the fleet, his only &s;on and &s;everal young noblemen, his companions, went together to render the voyage more agreeable. The young prince, de&s;irous to be fir&s;t a-&s;hore, promi&s;ed the &s;eamen a reward, if they came in foremo&s;t. This emulation was fatal to them all; the pilot ran the &s;hip upon a rock, and immediately &s;he

The prince, however, was put in|to a boat, and would have e&s;caped, had he not been called back by the cries of Matilda, his &s;i&s;ter, who was married to the emperor of Germany, Henry V. and who was ther in the &s;ame &s;hip; he prevailed upon the &s;ailors to row back to take her in; and the approach of &s;ave their lives, &s;everal leaped in, &s;o that the boat was over-loaded, and all except one, went to the bottom.

The king obliged the nobility to take an oath to &s;upport his daughter on the throne, after his decea&s;e, which they did, by ob&s;erved it no longer than whil&s;t they were obliged to obey. Hen|ry did not long &s;urvive this, but died in the year 1135.</P>
<P>During the reign of Henry, the barons and the clergy were growing into power. each was a petty tyrant over tho&s;e who held under him. In order, therefore, to con|firm privileges &s;o lately acquired, they joined in electing a king, who might owe his &s;ceptre to them. They fixed on Stephen, nephew to the decea&s;ed king; and as for their oaths to Matilda, (or Maude, as &s;he was called,) the bi&s;hops gave them an ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>The kingdom now began to wear the face of ari&s;toracy, in which the barons and clergy might be &s;aid to command. They built ca&s;tles, fortified and garri&s;oned them with their own troops, from whence, when offended, they would bid their monarch defiance.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="40">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Arundel, in Su&s;&s;ex. A civil war was the con&s;equence, a victory was obtained again&s;t the king; and though he fought with a party of the enemy with the utmo&s;t intrepidity, performing more than could be expected from a &s;ingle arm, his &s;word flying in pieces he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf a pri&s;oner.

<P>Matilda was now proclaimed queen but as &s;he di&s;dain|ed to accept the &s;hadow of royalty, and the barons and clergy intending to grant no more, offence was &s;oon given. Matilda was obliged to quit England again, Stephen was relea&s;ed and once more placed upon the throne.</P>
<P>Stephen, like Matilda, not caring to &s;ubmit to the dic|tates of his &s;ubjects; the barons invited over Henry, Ma|tilda's &s;on, then twenty one years of age, who had been long acknowledged as duke of Normandy.

<P>He demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tles, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all foreign troops, re&s;umed the crown lands, and enacted &s;ome laws by which the people became, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, indepen|dent of the barons. He chartered &s;everal towns, and laid the ground-work of Engli&s;h liberty. Having thus dimi|ni&s;hed the power of the barons, by enlarging that of the people, he undertook to humble the clergy. He propo|&s;ed, that the bi&s;hops &s;hould not be permitted to go to Rome; that no &s;ubject &s;hould appeal to the Pope; that no officer of the crown, &s;hould be excommunicated, or &s;u&s;pended by the clergy; and, that the clergy them&s;elves &s;hould be &s;ubject to the temporal judge. The&s;e propo|&s;itions
<PB N="36" REF="41">were agreed to; Becket, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, however, a powerful and haughty man, not caring to &s;ubmit, was condemned as a traitor; but, e&s;caped puni&s;hment, by flying his country.</P>
<P>The Pope (Alexander III.) e&s;pou&s;ed Becket's quarrel; and, after a variety of conferences and negociations; with threats and excommunications on the part of the Pope, which continued &s;ome years, Henry thought proper to acquie&s;ce and pardon him. The archbi&s;hop then made his way into London, amid&s;t the exclamations of the peo|ple. He was no &s;ooner however re-in&s;tated in his power, than he excommunicated two of the nobility, and &s;u&s;pended &s;everal of the bi&s;hops who had been his enemies. Com|plaint was made to the king, then in Normandy, and four gentlemen at the in&s;tance of Henry, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, under|took to curb his in&s;olence: they ha&s;tened to England, entered the cathedral of Canterbury, where he was offici|ating, and with a few attendants, beat out his brains, with clubs, at the foot of the altar.</P>
<P>His death confirmed tho&s;e privileges to the clergy, which his oppo&s;ition could not do. He was con&s;idered as a martyr to his cau&s;e, and to have fallen by the hand of Henry.</P>
<P>In order to dive&s;t the attention of the public from &s;u&s;|picions of this nature, Henry undertook the conque&s;t of Ireland; a project formed &s;ome years before, but deferred on account of his long-protracted quarrel with Becket. The more readily to gain the Pope's con&s;ent to this, (for nothing then could be done without the &s;anction of Rome) he made oath, that he was no way concerned in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation of this archbi&s;hop, and made a &s;olemn vow, to go bare-footed to Becket's tomb, and there receive the chi&s;cipline of the church; he kept his vow, and &s;ometime after was whipped by the Monks accordingly.</P>
<P>Having abtained the Pope's con&s;ent, he &s;ubdued Ire|land with a rapidity equal to his wi&s;hes; but the happine&s;s he received from this new acce&s;&s;ion of power, was &s;oon allayed, by a con&s;piracy in his own family.

<P>A power the Pope formerly claimed of depriv|ing a per&s;on of the benefit of the laws of his country, ex|cluding him from the bo&s;om of the church: the eccle&s;ia|tical court retains the &s;ame power now, and denounces it on particular offenders.

<P>What the Pope had formerly done, the barons thought proper to do now; they offered the crown of England to France, and Philip accepted it with joy; but, fearing the Pope's di&s;plea&s;ure, he prevailed on the Engli&s;h barons to elect his &s;on Louis. In this they agreed, and the city of London lent it's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>It was a &s;cheme of the queen dowager's to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Henry of the crown; for which, &s;he was con|fined in a mona&s;tery, where &s;he remained many year till &s;he died. To get rid however of this impo&s;ture, Henry
<PB N="57" REF="62"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rdered the earl of Warwick, who was &s;till a pri&s;oner in the tower, to be led publickly through the &s;treets of Lon|don, to convince the people of the deception. But this did not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; Simnel being joined by &s;ome of the di&s;contented party came over to England, and marched to York. The people here did not join him, and the king giving him battle, Simnel's party was de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eated, and he him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner. Henry had too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch greatne&s;s of mind, to put him to death, but ap|pointed him to a mean office in his &s;ervice, in which po&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e died. As for the prie&s;t his in&s;tructor, he was made a pri&s;oner for life.</P>
<P>All things being thus adju&s;ted, Henry, laid a de&s;ign of recovering his French dominions, by an attack upon France, and the parliament furni&s;hed him with &s;upplies for that purpo&s;e; but, when the money came to be col|lected, it occa&s;ioned a new in&s;urrection, and the earl of Northumberland, in attempting to enforce obedience to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he laws, was killed by the mob in York&s;hire. The mu|tineers did not &s;top here, but, by the advice of one John|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-Chambre, marched towards London, to give the king battle; and the con&s;equence was a defeat and the death of their ring-leader, who was executed upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Scarce was this matter ended, but the old duche&s;s of Burgundy, &s;i&s;ter to Edward IV. &s;et on foot another im|po&s;tor. She fir&s;t &s;pread a report that the duke of York, Edward IVth's &s;econd &s;on, was not murdered in the tow|er, as was &s;aid, but was &s;till alive; and then pitched upon a genteel young man, the &s;on of a Flemi&s;h Jew, to per&s;onate him. At the de&s;ire of the duche&s;s, the king of France received him, but afterwards at Henry's re|que&s;t di&s;countenanced him.</P>
<P>Henry took &s;ome pains to &s;hew the people the fallacy of this, by proving that the duke of York was dead, and puni&s;hing his murderers, and by tracing the impo&s;tor, who&s;e name was Perkin Warbeck, to his original ob&s;cu|rity; but &s;o determined was the king's enemies to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s him of the crown, that nothing could interrupt their de&s;ign.

<P>But this &s;tone which I touch with my foot equally dumb and immoveable, and yet it is neither tree nor a plant. Learn then the principal difference between a brute, a plant, and a &s;tone.

<P>True, my friend: you enter perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto my ideas.

Nothing is more impor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant than to think of one's latter end. St. Bernard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed frequently to &s;ay to him&s;elf, "Bernard, for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd did you come into the world?"

Yes, my dear Eugenius, to live, as if we were not to die, or as if we had nothing after death either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o hope or to fear, is the height of blindne&s;s; it is to forget that we are men; it is, in &s;hort, to deba&s;e our|&s;elves below the brute creation.

This is chiefly acquired by reading, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t on this &s;ubject, let me recom|mend you to a book I have publi&s;hed for the pur|po&s;e, it points out THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORDS ESTEEMED SYNONIMOUS in the Engli&s;h lan|guage, and will be found of u&s;e to &s;uch as wi&s;h to &s;peak or write with propriety and elegance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sold by <HI>R.

<P>A Univer&s;ity is a &s;eminary, or &s;chool, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earned men, and &s;uch as every wi&s;e government thinks right to e&s;tabli&s;h within their dominions. Some coun|tries have many, &s;ome fewer. England has two, Oxford and Cambridge; Scotland has four, Edin|burgh, Gla&s;gow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews; and Ireland has one, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Dublin. Each of the&s;e Univer&s;ities con&s;i&s;ts of one or more colleges, with cer|tain endowments. Government having granted them charters, with certain privileges, large &s;ums of money have been given from time to time by well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, to found certain hou&s;es or colleges in tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owns. In Oxford there are twenty colleges, in Cam|bridge &s;ixteen, in Dublin but one. Each of the&s;e col|leges are, through noble contributions of the rich, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of e&s;tates &s;ufficient to maintain a certain number of per&s;ons called Fellows, who live together in &s;ociety, and who employ them&s;elves in educating young men, either in law, phy&s;ic, or divinity. Such as go there for &s;tudy, pay for their education, and to en|courage per&s;ons to &s;end their &s;ons to the&s;e places, there are certain privileges annexed to tho&s;e on whom the Univer&s;ities &s;hall be plea&s;ed to confer a degree or mark of di&s;tinction. A clergyman cannot hold two livings unle&s;s he has taken the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts, or Batchelor of Laws, in one of our Univer&s;ities; nor can he be made a bi&s;hop, until he has taken a Doctor's degree; &s;o likewi&s;e in phy&s;ic. A phy&s;ician cannot practice as &s;uch, until he has taken the degree of a Doctor of phy&s;ic. And before the&s;e degrees are given, the candidates for tho&s;e honours are examined as to their proficiency in the &s;cience they profe&s;s.</P>

<P>You do not know then that wheat is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all merchandi&s;e, being the fir&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary?

<P>Certainly: The better a market is &s;erved, the greater the variety; we can then have &s;uch cattle as we want, and &s;uch as plea&s;e us be&s;t.

<P>To accommodate the people in all towns is the rea&s;on of e&s;tabli&s;hing markets once or twice a week; and be&s;ides the&s;e &s;tated days weekly, there are particular markets at certain times of the year, called Fairs: The&s;e fairs are authori&s;ed by government, and are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the benefit of the neighbourhood where they are held, and for the convenience of &s;elling that merchan|di&s;e that is produced in the places round about.

<P>It was. A &s;ingle river, which nature alone has formed, is not, in general, &s;o &s;trait nor &s;o conve|nient for the pa&s;&s;age of boats. Rivers generally wind a great deal, and have a number of &s;hallow places that are difficult to pa&s;s; be&s;ides, rivers do not always run from town to town as the&s;e canals are made to do. Here the banks are made for the purpo&s;e of hor&s;es to draw the barges along, and with wharfs for the convenience of loading and unloading them. See how the merchandi&s;e is ranged in different places; timber, firewood, bricks, paving &s;tones, &s;and, coals, and other things which are here to be conveyed away in waggons to the places they are going to.</P>

<P>A certain company of gentlemen. Suppo&s;e, for example, one hundred join one thou&s;and pounds a-piece, that is, one hundred thou&s;and pounds; this done they apply to parliament for leave to make the canal, and when parliament have pa&s;&s;ed an act for that purpo&s;e, allowing them to take pa&s;&s;es-on it, they carry their plan into execution. So that each of the&s;e gen|tlemen have one hundredth &s;hare in &s;uch canal, and the profit ari&s;ing from the toll, after the expences of keep|ing the banks, &amp;c. in repair, is divided among them, in proportion to their &s;hares. By which means they get often a large intere&s;t for the u&s;e of the money &s;o advanced; and they can &s;ell their &s;hares at any time. Turnpike roads are made by the &s;ame means, and the toll paid at the gates is the property of the per&s;ons who contribute to make the road. Before turnpikes were made, the roads were impa&s;&s;ible; no one there|fore &s;hould grudge a few pence for the convenience of good roads. Turnpikes are now made from town to town all over the kingdom, and, in proce&s;s of time, canals will be as general.

<P>The longitude of any place is its di&s;tance, ea&s;t or we&s;t from the port we &s;ail. And to find this out, we calculate by the pace or rate that the &s;hip goes at. Knowing how far di&s;tant the place is to which the &s;hip is going, &s;eamen take notice, at &s;everal periods through the day and night, how fa&s;t the ve&s;&s;el &s;ails, as whether &s;he goes &s;ix, &s;even, or eight miles an hour, more or le&s;s. This is found by throwing what is called the log line, which is a line with a knot at certain di&s;tances, wound off a reel into the water at the &s;hips &s;ide, by a minute gla&s;s, and in proportion as the &s;hip runs from the knots in this line, each of which is a mile,

<P>The Ea&s;t India Company, is a number of people in partner&s;hip together for the purpo&s;e of trading to the Ea&s;t Indies.

<P>And how is this accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e we are not &s;en&s;ible of our own mo|tion. You mu&s;t have taken notice, that when we were in a boat, the &s;hore we looked at and every thing upon that &s;hore, &s;eemed to move the contrary way to that we were going; for &s;uch is the wi&s;e direction of Providence, that partaking of the motion of the earth in common with the earth, we are not &s;en&s;ible of its moving, and of cour&s;e are led to &s;uppo&s;e that the objects move, on which we look. The earth whirls round at the rate of 900 miles an hour, and were we to be &s;en&s;ible of its motion the con&s;equences would be very bad. Indeed, every thing upon it, partakes of the common motion of the globe it&s;elf, and is not any way affected by that mo|tion, in the &s;ame manner as no alteration takes place in any thing on board a &s;hip, let the &s;hip move as fa&s;t as it will. A bottle of water, for example, hung up, or board a ve&s;&s;el, to empty it&s;elf, drop by drop, into ano|ther bottle placed under it, with a narrow neck, the drops will all fall directly into the bottle, though the &s;hip &s;hall have run many inches whil&s;t the drop was in the air.</P>

<P>As the hours and days are accounted for by the motion of the earth round its axis; &s;o are the months and &s;ea&s;ons by its revolution round the &s;un&punc; It makes its great circuit once in twelve months. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as the &s;un is not immediately in the centre of that great circle which the earth de&s;cribes, it mu&s;t happen, that in its cour&s;e, it is at one time of the year nearer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;un than at another.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that po&s;&s;ible? The nearer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> earth is to the &s;un, one would &s;uppo&s;e, the more it mu&s;t feel its heat; now we feel le&s;s of its heat in winter than in &s;ummer?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This ari&s;es from the po&s;ition the earth
<PB N="57" REF="138"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with re&s;pect to the &s;un. When the &s;un is farthe&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom the earth, as in &s;ummer, it is over our heads, and its rays fall down perpendicularly upon us, and in that direction, a great many more rays fall on any par|ricular &s;pot, than when they fall on us in an oblique direction, or come upon us &s;ideways, as they do in win|ter, the &s;un being then apparently lower in the hea|vens. Be&s;ides, in &s;ummer, then &s;un though further off, is more hours with us, every day than in winter; of cour&s;e the longer it &s;hines on us, though perhaps not &s;o hot, the more it warms the earth, than a greater heat would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o in winter in fewer hours.</P>
<P>Therefore, as the earth is round, it is plain to &s;ee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom its daily and annual motions, that the &s;ea&s;on, and the days and nights, mu&s;t vary on the different parts of the globe.

In &s;ome parts of the globe, there is only one night and one day throughout the year, that is, the &s;un is &s;een for &s;ix months in the year, and is not &s;een for the other &s;ix; in the&s;e places, the &s;un never ri&s;es very high, but yet &s;ets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot during the whole &s;ix months, but &s;eems to go round and round us; during the other &s;ix months it never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;es. The Greenlanders are in this &s;ituation, who ge|nerally quit the i&s;land when the &s;un leaves it.</P>

<P>The I will explain it to you. Though ge|nerally &s;peaking, we &s;ay, that the earth takes a year to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake her circuit round the &s;un, yet the exact time &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">akes is 365 days 6 hours, wanting &s;ome minutes; now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s our year is divided into 365 days, in four years we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould lo&s;e nearly a day, if we did not add it occa|&s;ionally to the calendar. To remedy this, every fourth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, in the &s;horte&s;t month, February, we add a day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aking it to con&s;i&s;t of twenty-nine days in&s;tead of twenty-eight, and this fourth year is called leap-year; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut by this occa&s;ional addition of a day, we gain forty-four
<PB N="58" REF="139">minutes every year; which in 133 years amount to one day, and in a greater number of years we had gained eleven days; government, therefore, in order to retrench the time &s;o gained, to prevent any change of &s;ea&s;ons by &s;uch acqui&s;ition, and to regulate our year by that of other countries, who had before take the &s;ame &s;tep, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to throw out the eleven days from the ca|lendar in September 1752, and to call the next day af|ter the &s;econd, the fourteenth.

<P>If you remember, you promi&s;ed, when you had explained the earth's motion, to give me an ac|count of the time-keeper for a&s;certaining the Longitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did; and I cannot do it at a better time than now.</P>
<P>The earth's &s;urface is divided into 360 equal parts, by imaginary lines drawn from north to &s;outh, which are called <HI>degrees of longitude.</HI> The earth's daily revo|lution round its axis ea&s;tward, as I told you, is per|formed in twenty-four hours, con&s;equently, in that time the places under each of tho&s;e imaginary lines or de|grees, become in turn oppo&s;ite to the &s;un, that is, the &s;un is, as it were, over the heads of per&s;ons dwelling or being in tho&s;e places, and it is then noon or twelve o'clock at &s;uch places. Now from the time any one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tho&s;e lines pa&s;&s;es the &s;un, till the next line pa&s;&s;es, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be ju&s;t four minutes; for twenty-four hours, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1440 minutes, divided by 360, will give four minutes &s;o that for every degree of longitude we &s;ail to the ea&s;t we, as it were, meet the &s;un, and noon will be four mi|nutes &s;ooner than it would have been, had we continues where we were; and, on the contrary, if we &s;ail we&s;t|ward, we, as it were, retire from the &s;un, and noon will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four minutes later.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have explained it very clearly. Now, Sir, for the Latitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Latitude is the di&s;tance of any one place from the Equator, or a &s;uppo&s;ed line, drawn round the globe of the earth, in the middle between the two poles or ends; that is, the di&s;tance from north to &s;outh. To have a proper idea of this, you mu&s;t con&s;ider the earth as round or globular, and that there is a fixed &s;tar in the north part of the heavens, called the Pole-&s;tar. When we are at the Equator, or middle of the earth, this pole-&s;tar appears level with the ground we &s;tand on; but as we travel towards it, that is, to the north, this &s;tar is ob&s;erved to ri&s;e higher in the heavens; but were we to turn our backs upon it and travel to the &s;outhward, that is, from it, we &s;hould &s;oon lo&s;e &s;ight of it, as the roundne&s;s or &s;well of the earth would hide it from our view. In this ca&s;e we &s;hould &s;ee a variety of &s;tars, that, in our pre&s;ent northern hemi&s;phere or &s;ituation, we can never &s;ee; and the more we continued our journey &s;outhwards, the more new &s;tars would ari&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n view; but on our return towards the north, we &s;hould lo&s;e them again. Now, as when placed in the Equator or the middle of the earth, the pole-&s;tar appears on a level with the ground we &s;tand on, &s;o as we travel northward, or towards it, it appears to ri&s;e higher in the heavens, and by mea&s;uring its height, which is done by an in&s;trument made for that purpo&s;e, called a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uadrant,</HI> we can tell exactly how far we have travelled northward, for every degree the pole-&s;tar is ri&s;en in the heavens, we have travelled &s;ixty miles from the Equator, &s;o that when we arrive in England, and mea&s;ure the height of this &s;tar, and find it fifty-one degrees and a half; which is the height of the pole-&s;tar with us, we know that we are about 3100 miles di&s;tant from the middle of the earth.</P>
<P>I will endeavour to explain this better by compari&s;on. Suppo&s;e the weathercock on a church-&s;teeple to be &s;een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t above the top of a hill; as we ri&s;e the hill, part of
<PB N="60" REF="141">the &s;teeple will appear, and the weather-cock will ap|parently ri&s;e higher. In like manner, the higher we get and the more we get over the hill, the higher will the weather-cock appear, as the body of the church will he then &s;een under it. Let the weather-cock be now the north or pole-&s;tar, and the hill, the &s;well or rotundity of the earth, as the further we advance upon the hill, and travel towards the weather-cock, the higher it &s;eems to be, &s;o the further we travel towards the &s;tar, and ri&s;e over the rotundity of the earth, the higher will the pole-&s;tar appear in the heavens, and of cour&s;e, the height of the &s;tar will mea&s;ure the length of way we have travelled.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The compari&s;on is a very ju&s;t one, and an|&s;wers the purpo&s;e you de&s;igned by it. You &s;aid, Sir, that the Moon was a &s;econdary planet to the earth, and not only revolved round it, but continued &s;o re|volving, during the earth's whole revolution round the &s;un?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Moon is an opake, &s;olid body like the earth, and all the other planets.

<P>This phenomenon is an effect &s;o extraor|dinary in the nature of Water, that the be&s;t natural philo&s;ophers, have not yet able to pa&s;s more than &s;ome rational conjectures on its true cau&s;e. It &s;eems as if it plea&s;ed God to conceal this among a number of other &s;ecrets of nature, which are impenetrable to the human mind. However, the general opinion is, that the &s;un, and particularly the moon, are mo&s;tly con|cerned in the flux and reflux of the &s;ea. The waters of the &s;ea in the flux, flow or are gently drawn from &s;outh to north for the &s;pace of &s;ix hours; in the reflux, they employ the &s;ame time in returning from north to &s;outh: re&s;ting about a quarter of an hour between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ebb and flow, and the flow and ebb.

<P>The&s;e tides are of great u&s;e when there is little or no wind, in carrying ve&s;&s;els up certain rivers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n their flow, and conveying them back again in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me of ebb: they are of &s;imilar u&s;e about the coa&s;ts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd carry &s;hips at the rate of about five miles an hour.

<P>Is the moon's power of attraction; always the &s;ame in the &s;ame parts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No; it has a greater attraction at new and full moon, than at the fir&s;t or third quarter; for the &s;ituation of the moon, with the re&s;pect to the &s;un, at the new and full, is &s;uch, that the &s;un con&s;pires with the moon at tho&s;e times to attract the waters, and cau&s;es a higher tide, than when the moon is in the fir&s;t or third quarters. At new and full moon, the tides are called <HI>&s;pring-tides,</HI> and ri&s;e nine or ten feet above the le|vel of the water, at low-water mark. When the moon is in the fir&s;t and third quarter, the water does not ri&s;e &s;o high, and the tides are then called <HI>neap-tides.</HI> From the time of neap-tide to that of &s;pring-tide, the water ri&s;e every tide more and more; till they get to the highe&s;t; from &s;pring-tide to neap-tide, they gradually fall more and more.</P>

Do not imagine that the &s;alt it contains is u&s;ele&s;s. Providence has made nothing in vain.

<P>The nature of the mariner's compa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This owes its origin to the load-&s;tone; a ferruginous &s;tone found in iron mines, which has the power of attracting iron. The virtue of this &s;tone was known to the ancients. Pliny &s;ays, it was di&s;covered by chance, from a &s;hepherd's finding that the nails of his &s;hoes, and the iron ferule of his &s;taff, clung to a load|&s;tone, over which he walked, but they were ignorant of that &s;ingular property it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of turning towards the poles. We do not know to whom to attribute this important di&s;covery. The invention of the compa&s;s is given to a Dutchman, in the year 1229. It is an iron needle or hand, like the hand of a clock, fixed on a point, &s;o as to run round; and one end being touched by the load&s;tone, which communicates its virtues to it, makes it always turn to the north. Thus a mariner, knowing what way he is to go, is always directed, though he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es no land. And what revolutions in things has the load&s;tone produced! It has made us acquainted with the new world: before this invention, &s;eamen never ventured out of &s;ight of land; but now they have tra|ver&s;ed the whole globe. It is to this we are indebted to,
<PB N="84" REF="165">not only for the di&s;covery of new countries, but for the rich mines of gold and &s;ilver, which the&s;e coun|tries produce, and which would have been lo&s;t to us, if we had never reached tho&s;e &s;hores.</P>

<P>The earth is divided by the &s;ea into four great quar|ters, Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America. The&s;e dif|ferent parts of the world are very different in &s;ize, form, climate, and productions.

<P>I could name many, for example, the Ca&s;|&s;iowary, one of the talle&s;t and large&s;t birds in India. I have &s;een one in the king of France's Mu&s;eum, more than five feet high. The Ca&s;&s;iowary is remarkable for its long black &s;hining feathers, that re&s;emble hair; but of all birds, the talle&s;t is the O&s;trich, common in Africa, although its body is rather &s;mall. The O&s;trich, like the Ca&s;&s;iowary, does not fly; but both are &s;o &s;wift of foot, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is difficult to keep up with them, even on the fleete&s;t hor&s;es. O&s;trich feathers are large and beautiful. We dye them of various colours, and u&s;e them for ornament: its down or hair &s;erves to make hats or bonnets. This bird, like many others, will &s;wallow iron, flint, and other hard &s;ub&s;tances, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, but they do not dige&s;t it, as people have &s;uppo&s;ed. They &s;ay al&s;o, erroneou&s;ly, that the imprudent O&s;trich depo&s;its its eggs in the &s;and, and leaves them to the care of the &s;un; when it is certain that they &s;it on them in the night, though they leave them in the day, knowing that burning heat of the climate is &s;ufficient to hatch them.</P>

<P>Certainly. It is, perhaps, the mo&s;t won|derful bird in the world. Not only for the beauty of its feathers, but its faculty of imitating the human voice. This is a native of America. They reckon more than fifty &s;pecies of Parrots, different in figure, in &s;ize, and in colour. They fly in flocks, and live in the fore&s;ts.

<P>Nothing is more wonderful than the manner in which the Creator has peopled the univer&s;e, with animals of all kinds: and we may &s;ay, that In&s;ects, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> vile as they may appear, are one of the principal pro+ductions of nature.

<P>That is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ilk-worm?</P>

<P>You are right. You know that it is from this, we draw, that mo&s;t delicated thread, that compo&s;e our fine&s;t &s;ilks. The &s;ilk-worm was brought into Eu|rope from the Ea&s;t Indies, about the year 550, its la+bour is very curious.

<P>You have no doubt, taken notice of the Ant. It gives us an example of indu&s;try. Ants will a&s;&s;emble many together to draw a little piece of wood, or a grain of corn to the bottom of their &s;ubterraneous granaries. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that they hoard it up in magazines, to feed them&s;elves in winter; but we have known that they remain benumbed, and without eating all this &s;ea|&s;on, heaped up upon one another in an ant-hill.

<P>And the Bees, Sir, is not their indu&s;try and labour very remarkable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very; a hive of Bees has been compared to a republick, where each &s;ubject labours for the com|mon good, and where all things are kept in good order. There is in all hives the mother Bee, which is called the queen, &s;he is larger, longer, and brighter coloured than the re&s;t. This mother lays all the eggs, from which the whole hive of Bees are hatched. She is &s;o fruitful, that in the cour&s;e of a year, &s;he will &s;ometimes give life to more than 40,000 Bees. The Bees have &s;uch an at|tachment to their queen or common parent, that was &s;he to die, they would di&s;per&s;e or &s;uffer them&s;elves to peri&s;h. Wherever &s;he goes, they will follow her. Some men have &s;earched for this queen Bee and having found it, placed it on their arm, and the whole &s;warm have there followed it. They will not &s;ting, unle&s;s rudely treated or roughly handled. When the hive it too full of Bees, the young ones will &s;warm out and e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in &s;ome other place.

<P>It is only in great heat of weather, that Glow-worms throw out this light; but there are &s;till more luminous in&s;ects in America.

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there any other reptiles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and very dangerous ones, e&s;pecially Serpents. Different countries have different &s;pecies of Serpents: there are &s;ome which we have no rea&s;on to dread, they are &s;o familiar. Some are winged, others amphibious. There are &s;ome more than twenty feet long, which attack and de&s;troy the large&s;t Quadrupeds; there are water Serpents, and Serpents of the &s;ea, of a prodigious &s;ize, and very formidable to &s;eamen. Among other Serpents we reckon the Rattle-&s;nake as one, &s;o dangerous, and yet &s;o common in America. In Nu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nidia many per&s;ons have been de&s;troyed by the bite of Serpents. The Viper, a kind of Adder, is viviparous, whereas all other Adders are oviparous. The A&s;p is another &s;pecies of &s;erpent which the ancients con&s;idered is one of the mo&s;t venemous. They &s;ay it throws the per&s;on they bite into a lethargic &s;tate, and thus de&s;troys
<PB N="106" REF="187">him. Hi&s;tory &s;ays, it was thus Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, put an end to her exi&s;tence, that &s;he might not fall under the power of Augu&s;tus. We hardly know now to what &s;pecies of Serpents to give the name of A&s;p; but that which we call the A&s;p in Europe, and which re&s;embles the Viper, is not venemous. Be&s;ides we never fail of remedies abain&s;t the venom of Ser|pents.

We cure the wound made by many animals, by brui&s;ing them upon the wound. Viper oil is a cure for the bite of a Viper. In &s;hort, there is none, even to the toad, that is not of u&s;e in medicine.

I would add, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a micro&s;cope, which is an in&s;trument that magnifies exceedingly, it has been found, that there is an infinity of living animals &s;wimming in all liquors, floating in the air, and &s;warming in the earth, much &s;maller than a hand-worm, which the eye can &s;carcely di&s;cern. Would you believe, that in a drop of the in|fu&s;ion of an herb, of vinegar, or of blood, we di&s;cover by a gla&s;s, a multitude of animalcula or &s;mall animals of different kinds, which move with great agility. Millions of in&s;ects are &s;pread thoughout the air, where they are invi&s;ible, and the eggs which they depo&s;it in liquors, are hatched there by fermentation. In &s;hort, when we come to con&s;ider that every one of the&s;e living atoms has eyes, and the different parts of an organized body, that there are in the&s;e &s;everal parts, mu&s;cles, nerves, veins, blood, and all things of which an animal body con&s;i&s;ts, and almo&s;t imperceptible; what are we to think of the &s;upreme arti&s;t that formed them!</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is natural &s;o to do. Among the&s;e you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible we owe the fir&s;t rank to horned bea&s;ts, and tho&s;e which furni&s;h us with wool. How great is this benefit to man! If a hen is a little trea&s;ure to him, by laying, as &s;ome will, 300 eggs in a year, a cow is a great one, &s;he &s;upplies us with milk, with butter, and with chee&s;e, and gives us each year a calf. What a
<PB N="108" REF="189">con&s;umption is there at our tables of beef and veal! What is more healthy or more nouri&s;hing! If we are in want of hor&s;es to cultivate the land, or draw heavy burthens, the ox comes to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is em|ployed in draught in many countries. Though &s;lower, it is capable of more fatigue than a hor&s;e, and is fed at le&s;s expence. After he has worked &s;ome years, he is fatted and killed, and his fle&s;h is brought to market. Neither do his &s;ervices end with his life, his &s;kin tanned is va|luable; this gives leather. In &s;hort, the gall, the blood, the fat, the bones, the horns, the guts, the hair, and even the dung of this animal, is converted to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>A agree with you as to &s;ervices of &s;trength; but in every other re&s;pect, this animal &s;o timid and which &s;eems &s;o pitiful in it&s;elf, is very valuable to man, &s;ince it &s;upplies us, at the &s;ame time, with food and raiment, not to mention the other advantages we draw from its tallow, its &s;kin, its guts, and its bones. The fle&s;h of mutton is light, &s;ucculent, and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. The milk of the &s;heep is &s;weet and whole&s;ome; be|fides, we know that the wool is one of the greate&s;t ob|jects of commerce, and how much its u&s;e is extended. It is different in quality, and Sheep them&s;elves vary very much in different climates; we call the male of the Sheep, a Ram. Many Sheep have horns upon their heads; &s;ome are covered with hair in&s;tead of wool. In Spain the wool is much finer than with us, and our be&s;t cloths are made of Spani&s;h wool. The Tails of the Sheep at the Cape of Good Hope, weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, and are broad enough to turn back and cover their whole backs. In Tartary &s;uch tails have weighed near eighty pounds.</P>

<P>The A&s;s does not de&s;erve the contempt it meets with. His long ears perhaps is one cau&s;e. This animal in however very u&s;eful, it lives upon little, and can bear a great deal of fatigue; and the milk of the female is reckoned very &s;alutary to con&s;umptive habits. In &s;ome countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es the A&s;s is &s;wift-footed. In &s;ome parts of France they run po&s;t with A&s;&s;es, as they do in Spain with Mules.

<P>Mules are a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, they are engendered be|tween an A&s;s and a Mare. As Mules are of two natures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nited, they are very rare, for they never breed them|&s;elves.

<P>What a wonderful act in a bea&s;t! It mu&s;t be allowed, Sir, that animals frequently &s;et us examples of a good di&s;po&s;ition, which we do not follow &s;o clo&s;ely as they do. You &s;aid the Lion was the &s;tronge&s;t animal. Is not the Elephant &s;tronger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but then it is much larger. It is the talle&s;t and bigge&s;t of all animals. It is a living colo&s;&s;us. They have been &s;een more then fifteen feet high. There are many Elephants in A&s;ia and Africa, but tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t Indies are the large&s;t. The figure of an Elephant is unlike that of every other quadruped. It is a heavy ma&s;s, without proportion. It has two great teeth on each &s;ide of its mouth, which are its weapons of de|fence. Be&s;ides this, it has a long no&s;e like a tube, with which it takes up its food, and which it u&s;es as a hand. The Elephant eats a great deal, though it can &s;tay &s;even or eight days without eating or drinking. Although very heavy, it is &s;wift of foot, and can gallop, but it does not turn readily. This animal, though wild, is very docile, being ea&s;ily tamed. There is nothing to fear from it, but when it is irritated. We derive great &s;ervices from the prodigious &s;trength of the Elephat. It will carry more than 3000 pounds. Formerly they were u&s;ed in war. Towers full of bowmen and archers were placed upon their backs, and they pu&s;hed on among the thicke&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atallions: men, hor&s;es, machines, all give way to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">normous weight. The greate&s;t enemy of the Elephant, is the Tiger, the Lion, the Rhinoceros, Serpents, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pecially Man, by the various means he makes u&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o kill him or to tame him. There are various ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">king them. Hunting the Elephant is one of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ea&s;ures of A&s;iatic princes. The Africans, who take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im only for what he produces, dig in their way holes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich they cover over lightly, and in which they fre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uently fall.

<PB N="112" REF="193">qualities are the cau&s;e of the great veneration the Ele|phant is held in by many people. At Siam, 100 officers are employed in the &s;ervice of a white Elephant. He is lodged in a magnificent pavilion, walks under a ca|nopy, and is &s;erved in ve&s;&s;els of gold. Ea&s;tern nations are fooli&s;h enough to believe that the &s;oul of their em|perors pa&s;s after their death into the body of an Ele|phant. I &s;hall clo&s;e this long account with telling you that it is a long-lived animal, and that its great teeth yield the ivory, of which &s;o much u&s;e is made.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros, is the mo&s;t curious, and after the Elephant, one of the large&s;t quadrupeds. It is more than &s;ix feet high and twelve long, and is &s;aid to grow fifteen years, and live a hundred. It carries upon it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no&s;e a long, &s;trong horn, which is &s;ometimes double, and with this it attacks and throwns down the Elephant.

<P>To enter into all the di&s;tinctions, would take up a great deal of time.

Quakers, admit of no preachers, but &s;uch as think them&s;elves in&s;pired; they are called Quakers, from their affecting to quake, when the Spirit a &s;uppoted to give them utterance, at other times they are &s;ilent at their meetings; and as to the Methodi&s;ts, they pretend to profe&s;s purer doctrines than tho&s;e of the church of England; but they are all Prote&s;tants not|with&s;tanding, and deny the authority of the Pope and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e church of Rome.</P>

<P>Becau&s;e tho&s;e States will not &s;uffer it; but it is one of the ble&s;&s;ing of our con&s;titution to be in|dulged in a liberty of con&s;cience. All religions are allowed here, even the Roman Catholic in private chapels, and under certain re&s;trictions, and this general indulgence is called <HI>Toleration,</HI> from their being here tolerated. But we are wandering from the &s;ubject we were upon, that of the duty and privileges of the King of England. His duty I told you. His privi|leges are as follow.</P>
<P>The King is the chief and &s;ole magi&s;trate of the na|tion, can of his own authority, reject any act of Par|liament pre&s;ented to him for &s;igning, and in &s;uch ca&s;es, it never pa&s;&s;es into a law; he can make any treaty with foreign powers, create any Peers, and pardon any of|fence, except where the con&s;titution interferes. The King can al&s;o make war and peace, without the con&s;ent of his Parliament; but though he can declare war, he cannot carry it on without money, and this money he cannot get without the people's con&s;ent; this therefore obliges him never to make war but with the approbation of Parliament. He has the appointment of Amba&s;|&s;adors to foreign Courts, who repre&s;ent the King that &s;ends them, and protect their countrymen when oc|ca&s;ion requires it.</P>

<P>The Sheriff of the county then is the fir&s;t. His office is that of Chief Gaoler and he has the cu&s;tody of all criminals and delinquents in the di&s;trict within his command. Though I call him Chief Goaler, he is, by virtue of his office for the time being, the fir&s;t man in the county, and ranks before every nobleman therein. There is one pre&s;iding over every county, and is ap|pointed by the King, out of the gentlemen re&s;ident in that county. The county pri&s;on, and the keeper of that pri&s;on are under his controul, and it is his duty to execute the &s;entence of the law upon all criminals, him&s;elf, or to find one to do it for him, though that &s;en|tence extend even to death. Mo&s;t gentlemen a&s;pire to the office of Sheriff, though it is attended with the ex|pence of 5 or 600 pounds for the year they &s;erve. There are two Sheriffs for the City of London, cho&s;en by the City.</P>
<P>The next officer to the Sheriff is the Coroner. Every county has more than one. Some have four, &s;ome &s;ix, according to the extend of the county. He is cho&s;en by the freeholders, and his office is for life, though he may be removed for mi&s;conduct. His duty is to en|quire into the death of &s;uch as are killed, die &s;uddenly, or in pri&s;on; he has fees upon the occa&s;ion, &s;o that his place is a place of emolument.</P>

<P>You have frequently mentioned <HI>rank,</HI> is it of any u&s;e to a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of great u&s;e. Precedence in rank is more attended to by great people then you are aware of. Precedence generally takes place in the following order. Princes, Archbi&s;hops, Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;|counts, Bi&s;hops, Barons, Knights of the Garter, Privy Coun&s;ellors, Judges, Baronets, Knights of the Bath, Knights, Doctors, E&s;quires, and Gentlemen. The no|bility are very particular to pre&s;erve their rank on all public occa&s;ions: and you will find a title re&s;pected every where. Be&s;ides, if there are any offices of profit in government, the church, the army, or the navy, the nobility can procure them for them&s;elves or their rela|tions in preference to other people; and all the depart|ments about the King are commonly filled with them. And add to this, they have a number of privileges. A Peer, like a Member in the Hou&s;e of Commons, cannot be arre&s;ted and thrown into pri&s;on for debt; they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll their po&s;t letters free of expence, and can frank or free the letters of others. A peer, if guilty of a cri|minal act, is tried always by the Hou&s;e of Lords, and can command an audience of the King at any time, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, can &s;ee him and &s;peak to him, without fearing to be
<PB N="128" REF="207">refu&s;ed admittance: and they, as well as Clergymen, re|ceiving the benefit of clergy, are not burnt in the hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I do not comprehend what you mean by Benefit of Clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is called <HI>Benefit of Clergy,</HI> had its ri&s;e in the pious reverence of chri&s;tian princes for the church in its infant &s;tate, being an in&s;titution to exempt the Clergy from being criminally proceeded again&s;t by &s;ecular or lay judges. Popi&s;h excle&s;ia&s;tics &s;oon made an ill u&s;e of this, for they afterwards claimed this indul|gence, not only for them&s;elves, but for all attendants upon the church, whether they were Clergymen or not; and in length of time, this exemption grew gene|ral, and all who could read had the &s;ame indulgence, reading being a great mark of learning in tho&s;e days of ignorance, till an act of Parliament of Henry VII. made a di&s;tinction between Lay-men and Clergymen, &s;ubjecting the former for certain crimes de&s;erving death, to be burnt with a hot iron on the left thumb, and deny|ing them this privilege a &s;econd time, and they are now not even required to read, but the indulgence is gene|rally granted to all per&s;ons both men and women. Clergymen, however, if found guilty of &s;uch offences as claim this benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand, but immediately di&s;charged, and this as often as they offend; whereas others &s;uffer death for the &s;econd of|fence: and as to Peers when found guilty, they are di&s;|charged without burning in the hand, but if condemned for the &s;ame offence of &s;econd time, will, like other lay|men &s;uffer death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do per&s;ons procure title?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By intere&s;t, that is to &s;ay, by their influ|ence with the King or the Mini&s;ters of State; and &s;ome|times by &s;ervices which they have done the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what kind is this influence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many Gentlemen from their exten&s;ive pro|perty can command the votes of freeholders, and free|men of towns, which &s;end members to parliament, of cour&s;e, they can appoint &s;uch members, and the&s;e mem|bers will naturally give their vote as the per&s;on &s;hall direct, to whom they owe their &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The King therefore will often be&s;tow a
<PB N="129" REF="208">title upon the Gentleman who appoints tho&s;e members, in order to obtain <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> votes; but titles are frequently given for &s;ervices done to the State, for example, to great State&s;men, Generals, Admirals, and men learned in the Law. The Chancellor is always made a Peer, which generally adds two or three to the Hou&s;e of Lords every reign, and &s;ometimes the Judges are made Peers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not at all wonder then, that men of great fortune are ambi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious to be created Peers, if &s;o much re&s;pect is due to their rank. Are there any more public offices be&s;ides tho&s;e you have named?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but the next are of lower order; I think the next is the <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> of which there are two degrees, High and Petty: High Con&s;tables are appoint|ed by the Bench of Ju&s;tices at the Quarterly Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, which are held quarterly at the principal town in the county, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in matters of &s;mall concern. They pre&s;ide over a di&s;|trict called a hundred, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal pari&s;hes. Petty Con&s;tables are inferior officers in every town and pari&s;h, &s;elected by the High Con&s;tables from the Pari|&s;hioners, and are &s;ubordinate to the High Con&s;tables. They are appointed by two Ju&s;tices to &s;erve one year: the duty of a Con&s;table is to keep good order in the pari&s;h, and for this purpo&s;e he can take up di&s;orderly per&s;ons, confine them and carry them before a Magi|&s;trate. This office is not held very reputable; and fre|quently tho&s;e that are appointed, for all mu&s;t &s;erve in their turn, will pay a fine or &s;um of money to be ex|cu&s;ed &s;erving; in this ca&s;e another takes the office.</P>
<P>The next public officers are the Surveyors of the High-way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every pari&s;h is bound to keep the High Roads through it in repair, except the Turnpike Roads; and Surveyors are appointed to &s;ee this bu&s;ine&s;s pro|perly done. There are generally two in every pari&s;h, appointed out of the &s;ub&s;tantial inhabitants, by two neighbouring Ju&s;tices of the Peace.</P>
<P>The la&s;t officers I &s;hall now mention are the Over|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of the Poor. Till the reign of Henry VIII. the

Their duty is to rai&s;e money in the pari&s;h, by collecting from every one, in proportion to the rent of the hou&s;e lives in, for the relief of their own Poor, who are not able to work, and to provide work for &s;uch as <HI>are</HI> able, and cannot get employ.</P>

What are called Gip&s;ies now are a &s;et of vagabond poor, who live in the open air, wandering about in companies, from one part of the country to ano|ther, pretending to tell &s;illy people their fortunes, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting wholly upon plunder: they are liable by our laws to be taken up, and if they have cheated any one of money, to be hanged.</P>

<P>England is divided into two provinces, over each of which pre&s;ides an Archbi&s;hop. Three of the Bi&s;hopricks, Durham, Che&s;ter and Carli&s;le, are &s;ubject to the Bi&s;hop of York, and the other twenty-one to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. An Archbi&s;hop is the head of the Clergy in his whole province, and governs the Bi&s;hops as well as the inferior Clergy. At the com|mand of the King, he calls the Bi&s;hops and Clergy of his province to meet in convocation. All the Bi&s;hops have &s;ome livings more or le&s;s to give away among the Clergy, and when a Clergyman of any pari&s;h dies, of which the Church is in the gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the Bi&s;hop, if the Bi&s;hop does not di&s;po&s;e of it in &s;ix months, the Archbi&s;hop has the giving of it away; he can grant a licence to a Clergyman, that is a ma&s;ter of Arts, in one of our Uni|ver&s;ities, to hold two livings, and he can grant &s;pecial li|cences to marry at any place or at any time; he has al&s;o the privilege of conferring a Doctor's or other degree in the &s;ame manner as do the Univer&s;ities.</P>

<P>A Bi&s;hop, as well as an Archbi&s;hop, be&s;ides the power of ordaining Clergymen and other holy ordinances, has authority to in&s;pect the manners of the Laity as well as of the Clergy, and puni&s;h delinquents by eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures; to this end, they hold courts of Civil Law.</P>

<P>Bi&s;hops and Archbi&s;hops are cho&s;en by the Chapter of their Cathedrals, that is, by the Dean and Prebendaries belonging to the Cathedral; but they are obliged to choo&s;e &s;uch per&s;ons as the Kind recommends. Their revenues ari&s;e from the great tithes of &s;everal Vicarages in their gift, and from lands appropriated to the bi&s;hoprick.</P>

<P>What are the&s;e tithes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tithes are the tenth part of the produce of the lands lying in each pari&s;h, which time out of mind have been the property of the Rector or Par&s;on of the pari&s;h, but for the maintenance of the Bi&s;hops, &s;everal of the&s;e Rectories have been converted into Vicarages, that is, the tithes have been divided, and the great tithes, as corn, hay, and &s;uch things as are mo&s;t valuable, have been appropriated to the u&s;e of the Bi&s;hops, and the &s;maller tithes, as milk, fruit, &amp;c. have been &s;ettled on the Clergymen who &s;erved the Church, and whom the Bi&s;hop appoints; &s;uch Clergymen are called <HI>Vicars.</HI> Whereas &s;uch as have all the tithes of a pari&s;h, both
<PB N="133" REF="212">great and &s;mall, are called <HI>Rectors</HI> or Par&s;on. Rectors al&s;o have generally &s;ome land annexed to their hou&s;es, the Vicars little or none; of cour&s;e rectories are of great annual value, from forty pounds a-year, to 2000 hundred pounds a-year, and often not &s;o much as twenty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You tell me that the great tithes of a pari&s;h are the property of the Rector, how is it then that &s;ome have fallen into Lay hands? for I have a relation who gives away the living to a Clergyman, but who receives the great tithes him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This originated among the Friars before the Reformation, when there were &s;ocieties of Roman Catholic Clergymen living together in one hou&s;e, called <HI>Convents,</HI> as many now do in France and Spain, and other countries, in the &s;ame manner as I have told you the Fellows live together in the &s;everal Colleges in our Univer&s;ities. By con&s;ent of the King they begged and bought all the Church livings within their reach, ap|propriating the tithes to the u&s;e of them&s;elves, and giving a Prie&s;t &s;ome &s;mall &s;tipend, or the &s;mall tithes for &s;erving the Church, who was thence called a Vicar, which means a &s;ub&s;titute. Now at the Reformation, when the Popi&s;h religion was aboli&s;hed, the mona&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eries were di&s;&s;olved or broken up, and the&s;e appro|priations or great tithes ve&s;ted in the King, who afterwards granted them to private per&s;ons, not Clergy|men, who have from time to time &s;old them or di&s;|po&s;ed of them to whom they thought proper. The&s;e appropriations from being improperly in the hands of Lay-men, are called <HI>Impropriations.</HI> Crown lands and obey lands were ever exempt from paying tithes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch lands therefore to this day continue tithe-free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are fir&s;t-fruits and tenths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fir&s;t fruits of living were the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ofits of the fir&s;t year, according to a rate &s;ettled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">292, and originally paid to the Pope. The tenths were a tenth part of the annual income of each living <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame valuation. At the Reformation the
y were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nexed to the Crown, and that valuation made, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich the Clergy are now rated; but by the bounty of
<PB N="134" REF="213">Queen Ann, all livings under fifty pounds a-year are di&s;charged of the&s;e payments, and what others pay is ve&s;ted in Tru&s;tees for ever, as a perpetual fund for the augmentation of poor livings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like to know how it happened that &s;everal noblemen and gentlemen have one or more liv|ings in their gift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will explain this by and by: to do it now would be breaking in upon the order in which I propo&s;ed to de&s;cribe to you, the &s;everal officers of the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will interrupt you no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before either Rectors or Vicars, I &s;hould have mentioned a Dean and Chapter. The Dean, with the Chapter of the Cathedral Church, (that is the Canons or Prebendaries, which are Clergymen that at|tend the &s;ervice of the Cathedral) are the Bi&s;hop's coun|&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with advice in matters of religion, or the temporal concerns of his bi&s;hoprick; mo&s;t of the Deans are appointed by the King, and &s;ome few by the Bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e. It is the &s;ame with the Preben|daries; &s;ome of whom are nominated by the King, and others by the Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>The next per&s;on to be mentioned is the Archdea|con. This is al&s;o a clerical officer, is &s;ubordinate to the Bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e, and is appointed by the Bi&s;hop, but has a kind of epi&s;copal authority independent of him. It is the province and duty of a Bi&s;hop to hold a vi&s;itation in the &s;everal parts of his dioce&s;e, that is to go round his bi&s;hoprick once in three years, to confirm the children, in&s;pect the manners of the Clergy, &s;o that the churches are kept in order, and that every reli|gious in&s;truction is properly attended. This I &s;ay th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Bi&s;hop does once in three yars, but the Archdeaco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> does it every year, except the year the Bi&s;hop attend. The Archdeacon has al&s;o a court for trying &s;piritu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> offences, and puni&s;hing them with &s;piritual cen&s;ures there are one or more Archdeacons in every bi&s;hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> according to the extent of it.</P>
<P>Rectors and Vicars I have mentioned. The Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> is an officating Mini&s;ter a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Rector or Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for which be is paid a &s;tipend of about fifty pounds year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="135" REF="214">
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a &s;mall &s;alary con&s;idering the great incomes of &s;ome livings. What do the revenues of Bi&s;hops and Deans generally amount to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Archbi&s;hoprick of Canterbury is 10,000 pounds a-year, that of York 8000 pounds; and the &s;everal Bi&s;hops, including livings they &s;ometimes hold, have from 7000 pounds to 2000 pounds. Deaneries are from about 1500 pounds a-year to about 200 pounds, and Prebends from about 700 pounds a-year to 50 pounds. So much then for the Clergy. I have now only to ex|plain the inferior offices of the church, <HI>viz.</HI> Church-Wardens, Pari&s;h Clerks, and Sextons.</P>
<P>There are generally two Church-wardens cho&s;en for every pari&s;h, one by the inhabitants, and one by the Rector or Vicar; the&s;e are the Guardians of the church, and the repre&s;entatives of the body of pa|ri&s;hioners. Their duty is to keep the church in repair, and collect money from the pari&s;hioners in proper pro|portions for that purpo&s;e, and they with the Over&s;eers have al&s;o the management of the poor.</P>
<P>Pari&s;h Clerks are generally appointed by the Rector or Vicar, and are &s;worn into their office by the Arch|deacon; their duty is to attend the Mini&s;ter in the offices of the church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been told that Pari&s;h Clerks are often Clergymen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In pari&s;hes where the office of Clerk is worth a Clergyman's notice, it is &s;ometimes given to per|&s;ons in holy orders; but they never officiate as Clerk, but appoint a deputy to do the duty.</P>
<P>Sextons are per&s;ons that toll the bell, dig the graves, and keep the churches clean and quite during divine &s;ervice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, you have gone through the whole, permit me to remind you of giving me an account, how the gift of livings fell into Lay hands, when I think, they &s;hould be in the di&s;po&s;al of the Bi&s;hop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though Lay-men may be the patrons of livings, that is, have the gift of the church, yet the Bi&s;hop has the examination of the per&s;ons appointed, whether he has &s;ufficient learning, and whether he be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man of good character or not. If he is found to be an
<PB N="136" REF="215">improper per&s;on, the Bi&s;hop can reject him, and Pa|trons mu&s;t nominate another. But now for an an&s;wer to your que&s;tion.</P>
<P>To make you rightly under&s;tand the nature of <HI>Patro|nage,</HI> I mu&s;t fir&s;t acquaint you with the origin of Manors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Manors are as ancient as the Saxon Con&s;ti|tution, which was general in this country before the year 1066, when it was conquered by King William I. A Manor con&s;i&s;ted of a certain di&s;trict or extent of land, (the extent of one or more pari&s;hes, or perhaps but part of one) the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the owner, and &s;ome part of which he kept n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ihis hands for the u&s;e of his family, the re&s;t was di&s;tributed to tenants, who, for the u&s;e of the land, con&s;ented to do whatever the Lord of the Manor commanded him, &s;o that they &s;ometimes went out to war with him and fought for him, &s;ometimes they cultivated the land he kept in his own hands, and did other &s;ervices which he required of him. This was the &s;tate of the <HI>&s;codal</HI> &s;y&s;tem &s;o much &s;poken of in hi&s;tory; men were then at the will of their Lord. Since that time certain indulgencies of Lords of Manors, cer|tain con&s;tructions of law, and certain incroachments of the tenants have made &s;ome alteration in this, and though &s;uch tenants &s;till hold their lands or e&s;tates at the will of the Lord, yet it is &s;uch a will as is agreeable to the cu&s;tom of the Manor, which cu&s;toms are pre|&s;erved in the Court-roll of the Manor, and kept by the Stewards; and tho&s;e tenants who have nothing to &s;hew for their e&s;tates but admi&s;&s;ions in con&s;equence of &s;uch cu&s;toms, witne&s;&s;ed by copies of entries in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion made by the Stewards, are called <HI>Tenants by copy of Court-roll,</HI> and their e&s;tate is thence called a <HI>Copyhold:</HI> for &s;uch e&s;tates they pay a &s;mall annual &s;um by way of acknowledgement, perhaps a few &s;hillings, called qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|rent, and the Lord, when they die, takes generally the be&s;t bea&s;t &s;uch tenant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, this bea&s;t is called a <HI>heriot:</HI> Lords of Manors have it in their power to re|lea&s;e &s;uch e&s;tates from heriots and quit-rent; in which ca&s;e, the e&s;tate is called a Freehold, and the owner <HI>Freeholder,</HI> and the&s;e are the people who elect the Knight
<PB N="137" REF="216">of the &s;hire to &s;erve in Parliament, provided each man's Freehold is not le&s;s than forty &s;hillings a-year.</P>
<P>Now, then, this under&s;tood, you will comprehend the nature of patronage. Great part of the&s;e Manors, as now, con&s;i&s;ted of wa&s;te ground, and as Chri&s;tianity &s;pread, the Lords of the&s;e Manors began to build Churches on their wa&s;tes, for the accommodation of their tenants, and obliged tho&s;e tenants to appropriate their tithes to the &s;upport of one officiating Mini&s;ter, which before, were di&s;tributed among all the Clergy in the dioce&s;e; and this tract or extent of land, the tithes of which were &s;o appropriated was called a pari&s;h: and becau&s;e they built the Church, they were allowed to nominate a Mini&s;ter, &s;ubject to his examination by the Bi&s;hop. This right of nomination is called an <HI>advow&s;on,</HI> and is &s;aleable like an e&s;tate, provided the Rector or Vicar is fir&s;t appointed.</P>

<P>It is very little pay, how do they contrive to live upon it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is with difficulty. Indeed the officers &s;el|dom do, they have generally &s;mall fortunes of their own. The army is a profe&s;&s;ion of honour rather than of profit, and &s;o great is the eagerne&s;s of young men to get into it, that commi&s;&s;ions are oftener purcha&s;ed than given away. 350 pounds is the price given for an En&s;igncy, and the pay is not more than about fifty pounds a year. In time of peace when regiments are quartered or &s;ettled in a country place, an En&s;ign can make &s;hift to live upon his pay, the inns upon the roads are obliged to give him a bed and three good meals a day for one &s;hilling, in which ca&s;e he has two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence left for cloaths and other things: and as to the common Soldiers, the public hou&s;es are obliged by act of parliament to give them a lodging, &s;mall beer, fire, and uten&s;ils to dre&s;s their food, with &s;alt, pepper, and vinegar for nothing, or to find them in victuals for four-pence a day.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e they enter very early into it, and are brought up with high notions of honour, bravery and politene&s;s to each other. There is &s;uch a di&s;cipline in the army that no officer dare contradict, di&s;pute, or di&s;obey the orders of a &s;uperior officer, tho' that officer &s;hall perhaps be only an older Captain, or an older En|&s;ign, on pain of being tried by his brother officers for di&s;obedience of orders, and of being puni&s;hed, broke, and di&s;graced, if found guilty: a lad that is undutiful to his parents or ma&s;ters, will be there &s;oon taught &s;ubordination and obedience; he will learn to live upon &s;ix-pence a day, to bear heat and cold and fatigue, and never to commit a di&s;honourable action.</P>

<P>HAVE you, my dear Eugenius, a right com|prehen&s;ion of the Courts of Law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very far from it; it would give me plea&s;ure to have them properly explained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a minute detail of them; but content my&s;elf with &s;aying only &s;o much as will give you a general idea of the principal of them, which are four; (for there are &s;everal that will be unnece&s;&s;ary to burthen your memory with) we will begin with the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t then is the court of Common Pleas, calcu|lated to redre&s;s injuries, committed by one man upon the property of another, in any part of the: kingdom.
<PB N="150" REF="229">It was e&s;tabli&s;hed in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall by King John, in 1216, where it has continued ever &s;ince. The Judges of this Court are four in number; the Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, and three <HI>pui&s;ne,</HI> or Under Judges, who &s;it every day in Term time, to hear and determine all matters of law, ari&s;ing in civil cau&s;es, real or per&s;onal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is meant by civil cau&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By civil cau&s;es are meant all infringements upon property, carried on or pro&s;ecuted by the per&s;on injured, in contradi&s;tinction to criminal cau&s;es, which are con&s;idered as breaches of the peace, and though commenced by the party aggrieved, are carried on in the King's name, as the chief magi&s;trate and enforcer of the Laws.</P>
<P>The Court of King's Bench is the next (&s;o called, becau&s;e the King u&s;ed to &s;it there in per&s;on) and is the Supreme Court of Common Law, in the kingdom. It has al&s;o four Judges, a Chief Ju&s;tice, and three <HI>pui&s;ne</HI> ones.</P>

<P>He &s;at there, as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to do now, but was not empowered to determine any cau&s;e, but by the mouth of his Judges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the authority of that Court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This has the &s;uperintendance of all Civil Corporations, commands Magi&s;trates and others to do what their duty requires, protects the liberty of the people; hears and determines both in criminal and civil cau&s;es, and is a Court to which we may appeal again&s;t all determinations of the Court of Common Pleas, and other inferior Courts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mentioned Common Law, what it under&s;tood by this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Common Law implies whatever has been cu&s;tomary throughout the kingdom; is perhaps as old as the kingdom it&s;elf, and the term is u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h it from tho&s;e Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed by Act of Parliament, and which are therefore called <HI>Statute</HI> Law.</P>
<P>There is another principal Court of Law, called the Court of Exchequer, which is a Court of Equity too and was e&s;tabli&s;hed originally to recover debts due to the King: people may, however, apply to this Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="151" REF="230">for redre&s;s &s;uch grievances, as they generally apply to the Court of Chancery for. There are four Judges al&s;o of this Court, called Barons of the Exchequer; a Lord Chief Baron, and three others.</P>
<P>But the fourth and la&s;t, is the High Court of Chancery, the mo&s;t important of all in matters of civil property. Here the Lord Chancellor &s;its as Judge, and determines the matter by his own decree; whereas, in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, the matter is heard and determined by a Jury of twelve men. But if a man thinks him&s;elf aggrieved, even by a decree of the Chan|cellor, in the Court of Chancery, he may refer his cau&s;e to the deci&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Lords, where it may be re-heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you mean by a Jury of twelve men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is e&s;teemed one of the greate&s;t privi|leges of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, that of being tried, or having his cau&s;e determined by twelve indifferent per&s;ons, cho&s;en by him out of forty-eight re&s;pectable men, of his own country, who are &s;ummoned for that purpo&s;e; by which means the deci&s;ion is not left to the determination of the Judge alone, who might po&s;&s;ibly be thought partial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you &s;aid the Court of King's Bench had the &s;uperintendance of all Civil Corporations; I wi&s;h to know the nature of a Corporation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Corporations are bodies of man united, by a Charter or Privilege from the Crown, for the purpo&s;e of protecting their own rights, or the rights of the Com|munity to which they belong. They are empowered to make certain laws of regulation among them&s;elves, and to enforce the execution of them, if they be not contrary to the laws of the land. Cities and all Borough towns that &s;end members to Parliament, are towns corporate or little republicks, and the Mayor and Aldermen of &s;uch corporate bodies are generally Magi&s;trates, within the limits of the Corporation.</P>
<P>The Corporation of the City of London, like that of other towns, con&s;i&s;ts of three branches. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council; in imitation of King, Lords, and Commons. The City is divided into twelve wards, and each ward elects an Alderm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.
<PB N="152" REF="231">and a certain number of Common Council. The Alder|men meet by them&s;elves, and &s;o do the Common Council, and thus between them, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Corporation is adju&s;ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why is the Mayor of London called Lord Mayor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a particular privilege, the Mayors of London, York, and Dublin, have the title of Lord for the year they &s;erve; which the Mayors of other towns have not.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are tho&s;e Courts that are held in the Country, I mean the A&s;&s;izes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are a kind of A&s;&s;i&s;tant Courts, &s;ent by the King's Special Commi&s;&s;ion twice a year all round the King's dominions. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to try by a Jury of the re&s;pective counties &s;uch cau&s;es as mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be brought up to We&s;tmin&s;ter. Thus for the ca&s;e of the &s;ubject, ju&s;tice is brought home to every man's door; di&s;puted facts are tried, if required, in the country, by neighbours; and criminals are pro&s;ecuted, where the witne&s;&s;es are near at hand to attend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there no other Courts of con&s;equence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. The Court of Admiralty is one, at which the Lord High Admiral or his Deputy pre&s;ides. This Court is held three or four times a year at the Old Bailey, in London, and one of the Judges generally acts as the Lord Admiral's deputy. It tries all offences committed on the &s;eas, or in parts out of the reach of the Common Law Courts.</P>
<P>There are Courts al&s;o for trying Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and there is the Prerogative Court for the trial of wills the Judge of which is appointed by the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>

<P>Who are the principal people employed in the&s;e Courts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The three chief parties on a trial are the Plaintiff, that is, the complainant; the Defendant, or the party complained again&s;t, and the Judge; but in the principal Courts, there are Attornies and Coun&s;el, as A&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>

<P>What is the office of an Attorney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Attorney at Law, in civil Courts, is as the Proctor in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, a per&s;on whom the Plaintiff or Defendant appoints to appear for him, and manage and conduct his cau&s;e. The&s;e Attorney<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are now formed into a regular body, and when admitted to the execution of their office by the Courts of We&s;t|min&s;ter Hall, are officers of tho&s;e Courts who admit them, and can practi&s;e in no other.</P>
<P>Of Coun&s;el there are two degrees, Barri&s;ters and Serjeants. Barri&s;ters, after they have been admitted five years, in any of the Inns of Court, &s;uch as the Temple, Lincoln's Inn, &amp;c. that is, after five year &s;tanding, are called to the bar: and after &s;ixteen years &s;tanding, they may be called to the degree of Serjeants. The Judges are always admitted Serjeants, before they are made Judges. Out of the&s;e Barri&s;ters of Serjeants, the King's Coun&s;el are u&s;ually &s;elected, the two principal of whom are called his Attorney and Sollicitor-General, who are always Members of Parliament.</P>

<P>It &s;eldom is in the church, and &s;eldom in the army, but almo&s;t always here; they mu&s;t have able men and good &s;peakers for Judges, and for the Attorney and Solicitor-General; but of two able men, he who has mo&s;t intere&s;t, is commonly preferred. From common Barri&s;ters, they are promoted to be King's Coun&s;el, and from King's Coun&s;el, generally to be Ma&s;ters in Chan|cery and Judges. Such of the Coun&s;el, as are appointed to be Solicitor and Attorney-General to the King, generally come to be Chief Ju&s;tices or Lord Chancellor. The Solicitor-General is commonly promoted to the office of Attorney General, and thence to be either Chief Ju&s;tice or Lord Chancellor, which &s;eldom fails to procure him a peerage.

<P>If you plea&s;e?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;iege of Troy, though founded on fact, is &s;o enveloped in fable, that the whole has, by &s;ome, been con&s;idered as fabulous. It is made the &s;ubject of an Heroic Poem, written in Greek, by Homer, the fir&s;t of Poets, who lived nine hundred years before the birth of Chri&s;t. To give you a complete account of it, you &s;hould fir&s;t be acquainted with the Heathen Mytho|logy, or the fabulous Deities of Antiquity. However, I will give you the be&s;t notion of it I can.</P>
<P>The City of Troy was &s;ituated in that part of Phrygia, adjoining the Bo&s;phorus of Thrace, which is now called the Straits of Con&s;tantinople, and flouri&s;hed about one thou&s;and two hundred years before Chri&s;t. We are told that Hecuba, the wife of Priam, King of Troy, when with child of Paris, dreamed that &s;he was brought to bed of a flaming torch, which, being con&s;trued by an Oracle, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have the gift of prophecy, to imply that the child of which &s;he was big, would, one day, be the ruin of his country and his family; her hu&s;band Priam, ordered him, when born, to be put to death; but Hecuba &s;ecreted him, and had him brought up by a &s;hepherd. Many years afterwards, Paris who
<PB N="156" REF="235">was unacquainted with his birth, came to Troy, to con|tend for a prize, which the king propo&s;ed to give among his young nobility, and won it. Hector, the elde&s;t &s;on of Priam, enquiring about this young man, &s;oon found him to be his brother. King Priam received him, ac|knowledged him, and gave him that rank that was his due. Some time after, Paris having been at Sparta to recover his aunt He&s;ione whom Hercules had run away with, took away be force Helena the wife of Menelaus, king of that city, and &s;wore he would never return her till his aunt He&s;ione was returned. The Grecian princes round about, took part with Menelaus, and engaged them&s;elves by oath never to lay down their arms, till they had overthrown the city of Troy.</P>
<P>The Grecian army was conducted by 95 leaders, kings, princes, or heroes much celebrated at that time for &s;ingular atchievements. And Agamemnon, king of Argos and Mycene, was declared commander in chief. Among the Grecian leaders were Ne&s;tor, Achilles, and Patroclus his friend, Ajax, &s;on of Telamon, the other Ajax, Idomeneus, Diomedes, Uly&s;&s;es and Palimedos. Their fleet was compo&s;ed of 2190 ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The &s;uperb city of Troy was defended by the all the princes of A&s;ia, and who to equal the forces of Greece, a&s;&s;embled a very powerful army. They were commanded al&s;o by very valiant princes, and by all the &s;ons of Priam (which were 50 in number) the elde&s;t of which was Hector, who alone could have &s;u&s;tained and re|pul&s;ed all the efforts of the enemy, had fate not de|&s;tined it to the contrary. The Trojans were every where conquerors under this hero; they drove the Greeks from every part, and burnt their fleet, &s;o that they repented of their expedition; for Achilles was offended with Agamemnon, and had with-drawn him|&s;elf, which changed the face of things. In this gene|ral di&s;comfiture, Patroclus the friend of Achilles, anxious to recal their good fortune, took the arms of Achilles, and put him&s;elf at the head of the Grecian army, repul&s;ed the Trojans and challenged Hector to &s;ingle combat. Hector advanced, and Pa|troclus fell a &s;acrifice to his &s;word. Achilles then, ex|a&s;perated
<PB N="157" REF="236">at the death of his friend, forgot the offence of Agamemnon, attacked the Trojan hero, killed him, tied him to his chariot wheels, and dragged him round the walls of Troy and the grave of his friend Patro|clus.</P>
<P>The death of Hector was as great a lo&s;s to the Tro|jans, as the retreat of Achilles had been to the Greeks. Priam demanded a truce or ce&s;&s;ation of arms for &s;ome days, during which time he went with part of his family and &s;ome rich pre&s;ents, to reque&s;t of Achilles the dead body of his &s;on, that he might be&s;tow upon him the la&s;t honours. Achilles, moved with the tears of Po|lixena, Hector's &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e beauty had &s;mitten him, yielded to Priam's reque&s;t. Paris, profited by this cir|cum&s;tance, and revenged his brothers death; he promi&s;ed Achilles to give him his &s;i&s;ter in marriage, and kept his word, and they were &s;carce a&s;&s;embled in the temple to &s;olemnize the marriage, than Paris took an opportunity to murder Achilles.</P>
<P>Enraged at this, Pyrrhus, the &s;on of Achilles, came with a con&s;iderable re-enforcement, and joined the Greeks to revenge the death of his father. But the oracle having declared, that Troy never would be taken whil&s;t it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the <HI>Palladium,</HI> (which was a &s;tatue of Pallas the godde&s;s of war, &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;cended from heaven and to have placed her|&s;elf upon the altar) Diomedes and Uly&s;&s;es took upon them to take it away, which they did with great clever|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Greeks however not being able to make them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city by force, undertook to &s;urpri&s;e it. They pretended that Minerva had puni&s;hed them for taking her from the Palladium, and after ten years &s;iege, in which it had co&s;t them the lives of &s;o many great and illu&s;trious men, they had recour&s;e to this &s;trata|gem. They con&s;tructed a wooden hor&s;e, in the belly of which they &s;hut up a great number of armed &s;oldiers, and concealed it in the i&s;land of Tenedos: they gave but that they built this hor&s;e as an atonement for the injury they had done Minerva. The Trojans, on the Greeks leaving it, crowded round the figure, and &s;e|duced
<PB N="158" REF="237">by a vain hope, which was heightened by one Sinon, whom the Greeks in&s;tructed to &s;ay, that if that hor&s;e was conveyed within the walls of Troy, it would thence forth be impregnable; &s;educed, I &s;ay, by this &s;tory, they in&s;tantly proceeded to make a breach in the walls, and introduced this fatal machine. This day, which was the la&s;t of Troy, became a day of merriment, in which each man gave way to the blind tran&s;ports of folly. Night came on, and when the whole city was at re&s;t, wrapt up in fatal &s;ecurity, the Grecian &s;oldiers opened the &s;ides of the hor&s;e, and under cover of the night, &s;pread them&s;elves in all quarters of the city, to which they &s;et fire, and the flames was a &s;ignal to the enemy, who entered by the breach, and put all to the &s;word. The Trojans made a de&s;perate defence, and did not yield till they were overpowered by num|bers. Pyrrhus in particular committed unheard-of cruelties. He broke into Priam's palace and &s;lew the prince and all his family at the foot of the altar where they had fled for refuge. Polixenes was con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of Achilles's death: her, Pyrrhus &s;acrificed upon the <HI>tumulus</HI> or tomb which the Greeks had rai&s;ed to his memory; Andromache, Hector's wife, had con|cealed her &s;on A&s;lyanax in the tomb of that hero; Uly&s;&s;es found him out, and threw him down from the top of a high tower; Pyrrhus took Andromache to Epirus afterwards and married her.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ad fate of the proud city of Troy, which took place in the year 1180 before, Chri&s;t. She &s;aw peri&s;h before he walls 886,000 Greeks, and within her bo&s;om 670,000 of her own citizens.</P>

<P>By virtue of this act of parliament, no man can be impri&s;oned without knowing the cau&s;e of &s;uch impri&s;onment, and having his ca&s;e fairly argued in a court of ju&s;tice. In all illegal confinements the pri|&s;oner may have a writ of Habeas Corpus, directed to the per&s;on detaining him, and requiring him to take him before a court or before a judge, within 20 days of the writ being delivered: if a judge refu&s;es to grant &s;uch a writ, he forfeits 500l. to the pri&s;oner: if the keeper of a pri&s;on refu&s;es to obey, the forfeits 100l. for the fir&s;t offence, and 200l. for the &s;econd. If when his ca&s;e is argued, he be acquitted, he cannot be impri&s;oned again for the &s;ame offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This certainly is but ju&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is however what no country but this can boa&s;t of. What is your next que&s;tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Navigation Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great Britain being an i&s;land, its whole war|like &s;trength depends upon its marine, or its power by &s;ea. As a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen, therefore, the fi&s;heries were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and every encouragement is given to foreign commerce, and with the &s;ame view the naviga|tion act was pa&s;&s;ed, during the republican government of this kingdom, when the parliament had put king Charles to death. By this act, not merchandize can be imported into England, but in Engli&s;h &s;hips of which
<PB N="160" REF="239">the ma&s;ter and three-fourths of the crew mu&s;t be Eng|li&s;h &s;ubjects; except it be in the &s;hips of that Euro|pean country, of which the merchandize is the growth or manufacture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why was this exception made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To encourage foreigners to trade with us, for it would have been hard to have obliged them to hire Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els to bring here the goods of their own country. All we wi&s;hed to prevent was, that no other nation &s;hould be the carriers of our merchan|dize: it was America chiefly we had an eye to, and the people there, before their independence, could &s;end nothing here but in Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els.&mdash;What is your next que&s;tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The nature of Naturalization.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To naturalize a man is to give him the pri|vilege of a &s;ubject born in this kingdom. Neither a Jew nor a foreigner can purcha&s;e an e&s;tate in this country, nor inherit one from his ance&s;tors; but when he is naturalized he can, and foreigners pay more du|ties on imports and exports than natural born &s;ubjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can all be naturalized that plea&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. If they chu&s;e to be at the expence of an act of parliament, which they cannot be with|out receiving the &s;acrament according to the Church of England, and taking the oaths of &s;upremacy and al|legiance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the&s;e oaths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the oath of allegiance, the man &s;wears loy|alty and fidelity to his King; and by the oath of &s;upre|macy, he abjures the Pope, and acknowledges the King to be the head of the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What in the expence of an act of parlia|ment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>About 300l. To encourage the Jews, who are a very trading people, to &s;ettle with us in prefer|ence to other countries, &s;ome years ago a general na|turalization bill was pa&s;&s;ed to reach to all under certain re&s;trictions; but the people of England were &s;o aver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to it, that had not the parliament immediately re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ealed it, they would have knocked the Jews on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="161" REF="240">head. They went &s;o far as to kill one or two at North|ampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The other things I wi&s;h to know are Mort|gages, Patents, and Pa&s;&s;ports.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ports are letters of &s;afe conduct, granted under the King's &s;eal to &s;ubjects of a foreign power, with whom we are at war; for without &s;uch a pa&s;&s;port, they cannot pa&s;s &s;afely in this country from place to place, nor can they convey their merchandize at &s;ea, from port to port, without its being liable to be &s;eized.</P>
<P>Patents are exclu&s;ive privileges granted by the King to the author of any new invention, to have to fole manufacturing and vending of the &s;aid invention for fourteen years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can any one obtain a Patents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any one the applies for it, on his &s;wearing that he is the original inventor. But it is in the brea&s;t of the King to refu&s;e it, if he thinks proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the expence of obtaining one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>About four&s;core pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, for Mortgages, and I will make my bow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Mortgage is, when a man borrows of another a certain &s;um of money, and grants him an e&s;tate, on condition that if he repays the money on a certain fixed day, the per&s;on holding the e&s;tate &s;hall return it to its former owner. The per&s;on borrowing the money is called the <HI>Mortgagor,</HI> and the per&s;on lend|ing it the <HI>Mortgagee.</HI> There is another article which you have not enquired about, but which is equally nece&s;&s;ary for you to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The nature of the Mortmain Act. When Popery was the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this country, it was cu&s;tomary for the Monks to per&s;uade per&s;ons on their death beds, by alarming arguments, to leave part, if not the whole, of their property, to the convent to which they belonged; and they &s;o often &s;ucceeded, as to become proprietors of very con&s;iderable e&s;tates, which were thus perpetually inherent in one <HI>dead hand.</HI> To prevent this, many laws from time to time have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade; and no per&s;on now can leave, by will any &s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="162" REF="241">of money to a charitable u&s;e, unle&s;s it be bequeathed and enrolled in Chancery twelve months before the death of the te&s;tator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accept my be&s;t thanks for the information you have given, me, and you &s;hall &s;ee that I will profit by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do this, my dear Eugenius, and I am amply gratified.</P>
