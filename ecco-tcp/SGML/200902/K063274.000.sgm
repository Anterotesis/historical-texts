<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>At Sea.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Make no doubt but you have long imagined that all our projected Schemes and plans of a Voyage to Sweden and a Lapland Journey, would come to nothing, and like Shake&s;peare's <HI>"cloud-capt towers and
<PB N="2" REF="18">gorgeous Palaces, leave not a wreck behind."</HI> When you &s;ee this Letter, however, all your doubts will vani&s;h, as we are now embarked upon the wide Ocean, and Favonian breezes are wa&s;ting us to the Shores of Sweden. You, and perhaps our other friends, are &s;miling at our romantic Expedition, you are laying your heads together and con&s;ulting how three mortals, like Sir H. G. L. Mr. B. and my&s;elf, can expect to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon Lapland mountains, or how we ever formed the re&s;olution of un|dertaking &s;o enterprizing a Journey. But, my dear friend, give your&s;elf no trouble about us. We have be|gun our Expedition with good Spirits and undimini&s;hed Courage and hope to fini&s;h it with equal <HI>eclat.</HI> Perhaps you will not believe me when I &s;ay that we are enjoying our&s;elves in our Cabin with our u&s;ual Engli&s;h Cheer, di&s;daining the blu&s;tering of Boreas or the tumult of the waves, with
<Q><L>One wide Ocean all around us,</L>
<L>All above us one black Sky.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is a variety in a &s;hort Voyage very agreeable to a per&s;on accu&s;tomed to live on land, provided he can en&s;ure him&s;elf from Sea-&s;ickne&s;s. The unbounded blue Horizon, the Sun-beam playing upon the waters, the
<PB N="3" REF="19">floating of the Sails, and gay tackling of the Ship, give a brilliancy to the &s;cene that cannot fail to plea&s;e. This is the delightful Pro&s;pect which the Land-man is &s;o apt to paint. But when the melancholy Sailor takes up the pencil, how different is the picture which he draws? He delineates &s;tormy &s;kies and rolling waves, he paints the over-hang|ing rock and foundered &s;hip, and all the hard&s;hips of a Seaman's Life. But, I think, I had better draw a curtain before this Painting, le&s;t, like the Child that dre&s;&s;es up a Giant, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation I &s;hould happen to be afraid of the creature of my own fancy.</P>
<P>When we arrive at Gottenburg, which we hourly ex|pect, I will give you the journal of our Voyage; and, as occa&s;ion offers, will continue my narrative during the re|mainder of our Expedition. Tho', in all probability you will not meet with much novelty, for I pretend not to vie with &s;uch celebrated Travellers as Coxe or Wraxal, yet &s;uch reflections you will meet with as will at lea&s;t &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity, how we executed our agreeable Scheme.</P>
<P>We took our departure from Raven&s;worth-ca&s;tle the Seat of Sir H. G. L. on the 24th. day of May 1786, and
<PB N="4" REF="20">embarked about &s;ix the &s;ame Evening at Shields on board the Gottenburg Merchant Capt. George Fothergill. We got under-way about twelve o'Clock at night, with a bri&s;k Gale at W. N. W.</P>

<P>SAFELY landed on the coa&s;t of Sweden, I have now time to re&s;ume my writing and fulfil my promi&s;e. I engaged my&s;elf to give you a faithful narrative of our proceedings. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to relate every circum&s;tance, with the &s;ame regularity that it happened, from the time that we lo&s;t &s;ight of Tynmouth Ca&s;tle and the Engli&s;h &s;hore. The two fir&s;t days pa&s;&s;ed along with unvaried tranquillity; our Ship &s;ailing gently with a fair wind from four and an half to, &s;ometimes, &s;even and eight knots in an hour. On Saturday the 27th. about &s;ix in the morning, we <HI>made,</HI> in the &s;ailor's language, the Naze, a point of land on the Norway coa&s;t at the Entrance of the Scaggerac, or as it is &s;ometimes called, Cattegat Sea. The country here appears to be very high and mountain|ous. Soon after we came in &s;ight of the Jutland part of the Dani&s;h Territories, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and pa&s;t the Scaw, a light hou&s;e on this coa&s;t, with a fre&s;h breeze, al|mo&s;t increa&s;ing to a Gale of wind. We were obliged to reef our top&s;ails, the &s;ea running &s;o very high. The
<PB N="6" REF="22">weather hazy, and exceeding cold. As our Voyage, however, was almo&s;t over we had no great rea&s;on to com|plain. About eleven in the morning we made Wing's Beacon, which is &s;ituated on an high barren rock not far from the mouth of the River Gotha. In this expo&s;ed &s;itu|ation live the Pilots, braving the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts for the &s;ake of their profe&s;&s;ion, as this commands a fine Sea-view, and &s;hips may be &s;een from hence at a great di&s;tance. When we came near this place we hoi&s;ted a Jack upon the Main-top-ma&s;t-head as a &s;ignal to the Pilots. They &s;oon obeyed the &s;ummons, and the &s;ame afternoon we were &s;afely moored in the Harbour of Gottenburg.</P>
<P>Soon after we landed, we dined at the Engli&s;h Hotel. After dinner the Engli&s;h Con&s;ul's Coach attended us at the Inn, and conducted us to the Hou&s;e of Mr. Smith, a Merchant re&s;ident here, who&s;e attention and civility de|mand our warme&s;t Thanks. We &s;pent the evening with him and were entertained with much ea&s;e and Ho&s;|pitality.</P>
<P>The Town of Gottenburg is neat, clean and well-built; the &s;treets are regular and uniform; the hou&s;es, chiefly of
<PB N="7" REF="23">wood painted &s;o as to re&s;emble brick and &s;tone. Part of the Town &s;tands upon a &s;wampy plain, which like the Dutch towns, is inter&s;ected by Canals, the other part upon the declivity of an hill. The Harbour is commodious and convenient. There are e&s;tabli&s;hments here of &s;everal branches of commerce, particularly an Ea&s;t India company and an Herring Fi&s;hery. From the&s;e two cau&s;es alone this place has increa&s;ed con&s;iderably in the &s;pace of a very few years. The Entrance of the Harbour is guarded by the fort of new Elfsburg which is &s;ituated on a &s;mall rocky I&s;land and garri&s;oned. The Markets here are extremely well &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries and for very moderate prices. The Chief Magi&s;trate here, is the Burgo-ma&s;ter, who regulates the Markets, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the civil direction of the Town, in the &s;ame manner as the Mayor of corporate Towns in England.</P>
<P>You will naturally expect that I &s;hould not be ma|ny hours in Sweden before I &s;hould be able to give &s;ome account of the fairer part of the Creation, who in every quarter of the Globe are entitled to attention.
<PB N="8" REF="24">But I will not be too ra&s;h in delivering my opinion, I am, as yet, but a <HI>young</HI> Swede, and therefore can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had many opportunities of ob&s;ervation. The Ladies, that have hitherto fallen in my way, have generally covered their beauties with a Veil. At lea&s;t I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e there is beauty where I cannot prove the contrary; tho' I own, from their &s;hapes and &s;izes, that Spectator is very complai|&s;ant, who gives them credit for per&s;onal qualifications which certainly do not pre&s;ent them&s;elves before his Eyes.</P>

<P>AS we intend leaving Gottenburg to-morrow, I &s;hall re&s;ume my narrative and give you &s;ome account of our proceedings &s;ince I wrote la&s;t. On the 29th. we accepted an Invitation to dinner from Mr. Hall, a Mer|chant of Eminence in this place, at who&s;e hou&s;e we were elegantly entertained after the Swedi&s;h fa&s;hion. The dinner, as well as &s;upper which followed, con&s;i&s;ted chief|ly of Sweet-meats, Fruits, &amp;c. which were plentifully inter&s;per&s;ed with ornamental Images. But do not ima|gine this was the whole of our Entertainment. Other more &s;ub&s;tantial di&s;hes were placed on the corners of the table. Among&s;t which were a Chader, (a Swedi&s;h bird) a cock of the wood (another great rarity) and a Pike Pudding. The latter di&s;h will require &s;ome explanation. It con&s;i&s;ts of a Pike dre&s;&s;ed &s;o as to re&s;emble the ta&s;te of a cu&s;tard, and yet not lo&s;ing the flavour of a fi&s;h. I thought it rather palatable than otherwi&s;e. The method of conducting them&s;elves at table has a very &s;ingular ap|pearance
<PB N="10" REF="26">to a &s;tranger. Every di&s;h, after being cut up, is handed about in rotation from one to another; every one helps him&s;elf and pa&s;&s;es it to the next. Wine and all other Liquors &s;tand upon the table. The rule is, to help your&s;elves without any kind of ceremony; they drink no healths. The Ladies were particularly a&s;&s;iduous in perpetually filling our gla&s;&s;es. The cloth is not drawn as in England, neither do the Gentlemen &s;it after the Ladies ri&s;e. Each Gentleman conducts a Lady to another &s;uit of apartments where Coffee is ready prepared. Tea about three hours after; then Cards and Mu&s;ic, or a walk 'till Supper. Upon this occa&s;ion &s;everal Officers both of naval and military di&s;tinction were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The day after, we dined with Mr. Smith and were re|ceived by him with great politene&s;s. It is the Etiquette of this country to &s;alute the hand of every Lady you are introduced to; a ceremony you may be a&s;&s;ured we did not forget upon this occa&s;ion. We partook of a mo&s;t elegant dinner con&s;i&s;ting of various &s;light di&s;hes, After Coffee, Mr. Bowes, Mr. Hall junior, and my&s;elf, walked with the Ladies by the &s;ide of a beautiful canal leading
<PB N="11" REF="27">to the country, returned to tea and cards; &s;upped and &s;pent the evening very agreeably. Several Swedi&s;h, French, and Engli&s;h Songs were remarkably well &s;ung. About twelve we returned to our Lodgings.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t. we were accommodated with the Con&s;ul's coach, and made an excur&s;ion of a few miles into the country. The rocks which we pa&s;t were picture&s;que and magnificent: the vallies &s;eemed rich and were cloathed with a fine verdure. We returned to dine at the Engli&s;h tavern, and &s;pent the evening with Mr. Smith.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t. of June we took a view of the Swedi&s;h Ordnance which were then exerci&s;ing for a review. It would be too humiliating to draw a compari&s;on between what we &s;aw, and the Engli&s;h Artillery. The Soldiers, in general, look old and inactive; their regimentals are bad and unbecoming, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Officers which are both whim&s;ical, gaudy, and ridiculou&s;ly ornamented with ribbons, died feathers, &amp;c. It may not be impro|per in this place to ob&s;erve that the forces of Sweden are, properly &s;peaking, a regulated militia. Their armies
<PB N="12" REF="28">con&s;i&s;ted formerly of pea&s;ants who were remarkable only for their courage and numbers. The Cavalry are &s;upport|ed by a rate rai&s;ed upon the nobility and gentry according to their e&s;tates; the Infantry by the pea&s;ants. Every farm of &s;ixty pounds a year is charged with a foot Soldier, who, if he marry, has a hou&s;e built at the charge of the pea&s;ant, who al&s;o mu&s;t furni&s;h him with hay to keep a cow in winter, pa&s;turage in &s;ummer, and mu&s;t plough, &s;ow, and reap for him; and when this Soldier dies, they mu&s;t provide one in his room. The Officers of hor&s;e and foot are maintained by the King, who appoints a certain por|tion of land for that end, &s;o that every Officer has a hou&s;e and land, and the rent of as many farms as make up his pay.</P>
<P>We dined this day with the Con&s;ul, where the Swedi&s;h Admiral, the French Con&s;ul, and many Barons, inve&s;ted with different orders according to the con&s;titution and cu&s;tom of the country, were pre&s;ent. In the afternoon we &s;aw the Artillery fire at a target. The Military per|formances were very indifferent. Returned to the Con&s;ul's and &s;pent the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="29">The next day was agreeably &s;pent in a vi&s;it to Mr. Hall's country &s;eat, which is &s;ituated about five Engli&s;h miles from Gottenburg. The &s;ituation is mo&s;t beautiful and romantic; it is environed with rocks of various &s;hapes, which run in ridges for many miles; below, appears to the view, a fine exten&s;ive Lake, far exceeding tho&s;e of either Cumberland or We&s;tmorland; it abounds in pike, perch, trout and a variety of other fi&s;h. The woods con&s;i&s;t chiefly of oak, hor&s;e-che&s;nut, birch, and mountain-a&s;h, which grow tall but are &s;lender, owing, I imagine, to the very thin &s;urface of &s;oil. The cattle which we &s;aw here were, in general, &s;mall, the &s;heep, few and bad, their cloathing more re&s;embles hair than wool. The hor&s;es are &s;mall, like the welch ponies, but amazingly active; their common po&s;ting is about nine or ten Engli&s;h miles an hour. The drivers are truly ridiculous both in manner and appearance. They have no harne&s;s for their carriages but u&s;e only ropes tied together with knots, which often &s;lip and impede your expedition; otherwi&s;e the velocity would be beyond the traveller's conception.</P>

<P>AT length, after a long and not di&s;agreeable journey, in which we &s;eldom &s;topped longer than nece&s;&s;ity required, we arrived at the Metropolis of the Kingdom of Sweden la&s;t night. That you may travel along with us in idea, I &s;hall continue to mention &s;uch particulars as occur|red on the road.</P>
<P>We left Gottenburg on the afternoon of the 3d. in&s;tant, and &s;lept that night at a &s;mall Village called Vadebaka where we met with very bad accommodations of every kind. Our beds were dirty and uncomfortable, and no kind of victuals were to be got, but what we brought along with us. The roads, however, were remarkably good and the country agreeably variegated with rocks and woods, tillage-land and barren moors. The woods prin|cipally con&s;i&s;t of the &s;pruce and &s;ilver fir, &s;ome few oaks and mountain-a&s;hes. The day following we pur&s;ued our
<PB N="15" REF="31">Journey through a fine country, and, as before, with de|lightful roads. I cannot omit a proper commendation of this attention to travellers. Indeed the advantage mu&s;t be great to every country where &s;o much care is taken of the public roads. Tho' we have no great rea&s;on to complain in England of our public turnpike roads, yet nothing there is comparable to the&s;e; &s;wamps, mora&s;&s;es &amp;c. are all equally made good; and tho&s;e fine woods and gravel roads have &s;o beautiful an effect that the traveller might fre|quently &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf entering the avenue or approach to &s;ome great Man&s;ion. We &s;topped at a very neat town called Lidkioping near the beautiful Lake Wenner which is the large&s;t in Sweden being about one hundred miles long, and &s;eventy-five broad. The river Gotha runs from hence by Gottenburg to the Sea. At Trolhetta there are &s;everal cataracts of great height and magnificence. In one place it falls over a rock &s;ixty feet high with &s;uch a noi&s;e that it is heard at the di&s;tance of two hundred furlongs. The timber that is floated down this river falls over this precipice with &s;uch impetu|o&s;ity that it di&s;appears for a con&s;iderable time before it makes its appearance again. The bed into which this cataract falls has been founded by lines of &s;everal hundred fathom but never di&s;covered. The &s;ame
<PB N="16" REF="32">night we &s;lept at Enebacken; our beds bad and horrid accommodations as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Very early in the morning on the 5th. we took our de|parture and travelled with wonderful velocity to Marie&s;|tadt where we breakfa&s;ted. This is a large town upon the &s;ame beautiful and exten&s;ive Lake. The woods were remarkably fine and thick on each &s;ide of the road, which is good, but mountainous. We found this a long and tedious &s;tage, yet the variety of objects, wood, water, and rocks, beautifully arranged, rendered it agreeable. The woods were &s;o exten&s;ive that we could &s;eldom &s;ee their limits. Of the Feathered tribe which we met with in this country, were the chader, ora, and black cock: of the Quadrupeds, the wolf, the bear, red and fallow deer, foxes, hares, and, it is &s;aid, &s;ome few elks.</P>
<P>This evening we re&s;ted, if it might be &s;o called, at Black&s;ta; beds wor&s;e than before, and as the luxury of &s;heets was not to be had, we &s;lept in our cloaths; and even the&s;e did not protect us from trouble&s;ome companions,
<PB N="17" REF="33">a large &s;pecies of the Flea peculiar to that country.</P>
<P>We continued our Journey the day following and pa&s;|&s;ed through a barren rocky country, very different from the la&s;t &s;tage. There was no entertainment to the eye for many miles 'till we came to Strom&s;holm a Palace be|longing to the King of Sweden; a very poor man&s;ion for Royalty indeed, but delightfully &s;ituated upon the lake Meller, which extends as far as Stockholm. The King's Stables in this place are thought magnificent and worth the traveller's notice, but in my opinion the very contra|ry is the truth. They are little better than our York&s;hire barns. They contain twenty-two hor&s;es which are e&s;teem|ed beautiful in Sweden. No &s;traw is here u&s;ed for bed|ding, but the hor&s;es lie upon boards. So far I mu&s;t acknowledge from my own ob&s;ervation that this method of treating hor&s;es is preferable to our own. Through all Sweden and Denmark you &s;eldom &s;ee a lame or founder|ed hor&s;e, which is not the ca&s;e in England. The rea&s;on undoubtly is, that they are rendered more tender by &s;tand|ing on a hot-bed produced by their own litter.</P>
<P>On the next day we pur&s;ued our Journey to Stockholm
<PB N="18" REF="34">not without hopes that we &s;hould reach our temporary home before night. We travelled the three fir&s;t &s;tages over barren heaths, mora&s;&s;es, &amp;c. A rocky wild &s;cene around us afforded us but little plea&s;ure, as our eye could neither be gratified by a fine pro&s;pect, nor our palate by a &s;atisfaction of a different nature. We were at length agreeably relieved by entering a rich cultivated country; delightful, well watered vallies, lakes ornamented with many trees and beautiful overhanging rocks. At Tibla we were not unplea&s;antly &s;urpri&s;ed with a tolerable dinner, and we arrived the &s;ame evening at Stockholm.</P>
<P>A De&s;cription of this Metropolis I mu&s;t defer 'till I have had an opportunity of examining the &s;cenes around me. Here, however, we are, &s;afe and well; and able to inform you how &s;incerely I remain &amp;c.</P>

<P>THE City of Stockholm is a well built town tho' badly paved. It is &s;urrounded by the Baltic &s;ea and lake Meller at their confluence. It is governed by two Burgo|ma&s;ters and twenty-four Rodmen or Aldermen. The King's Palace is magnificent. The Exchange is al&s;o a good and &s;pacious building, the re&s;ort of many capital merchants. The Churches here are &s;uperbly decorated with a great variety of &s;plendid ornaments. The people &s;hew you much politene&s;s, and dre&s;s in a &s;tile re&s;embling that of the Spaniards. The almo&s;t ob&s;olete French fa&s;hion is &s;till in practice among the men, as they &s;eldom meet but they &s;alute each other.</P>
<P>The day after our arrival we dined at a Tavern, remark|able for dirt and bad accommodation. In the evening we went to the Opera; the hou&s;e is a hand&s;ome building, magnificently lighted up. His Maje&s;ty, the young Prince,
<PB N="20" REF="36">and many of the Nobility, were pre&s;ent. The dre&s;&s;es of the Actors were &s;uperb; the performance, a Swedi&s;h hi&s;|torical piece repre&s;enting Gu&s;tavus I. be&s;ieging the city of Stockholm, and routing the Danes out of the country. A magnificent &s;tatue is erected before the diet-hou&s;e in memory of that Prince whom the Swedes regard at this day as their deliverer from Dani&s;h tyranny.</P>
<P>The next day we waited upon Sir Thomas Wroughton, who is the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter re&s;ident at this court; a Gen|tleman of great politene&s;s and affability, who fills that department with much credit to him&s;elf, and honor to his country.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 10th. we made a party to view the Citadel, an ancient building, where may be &s;een the royal armory, colours, and other trophies worthy of ob|&s;ervation, taken by the military Heroes of the nation. The curio&s;ities which we thought mo&s;t remarka|ble were, Charles the XII's &s;hirt, coat, boots and gloves which he wore at the time when he was killed at the &s;iege of Frederick&s;hall. The regimental coat is of a dark blue colour, with large round gilt buttons, the
<PB N="21" REF="37">wai&s;tcoat and breeches yellow, his &s;hirt fine, but plain, a black plain cravat, his boots very &s;trong and long with &s;quare toes and &s;teel &s;purs, his gloves made of very &s;trong leather, with &s;tiff tops; the hat al&s;o which he wore that day was &s;hot through above the right eye; a &s;hot which killed him upon the &s;pot. Various are the conjectures, even to this day, concerning the fall of that ra&s;h Hero. It is &s;urmi&s;ed with circum&s;tantial probability that he fell by the hand of &s;ome of his own Army. It is certain, blood is &s;till to be &s;een on the gloves, and the mark of his fingers is evident upon his &s;word belt. It &s;eems as if he had put his hand to the wound when &s;hot, and immediate|ly attempted to draw his &s;word to &s;tab, or defend him|&s;elf again&s;t, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Undoubtedly he had involved his country in much debt, and many difficulties; but being of a turbulant &s;pirit (almo&s;t bordering on madne&s;s) would not li&s;ten to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and repeated &s;olicitations of his injured Subjects. His premature death, therefore, may be thus accounted for without any improbability. He fell a martyr to his ambition.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 11th. we went to St. Nicholas's Church. After divine &s;ervice we were &s;hewn many &s;uperb and
<PB N="22" REF="38">co&s;tly ornaments of &s;ilver and gold. As the Lutheran Profe&s;&s;ion is very different from that of the church of Rome, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find the popi&s;h mode of wor&s;hip, with re&s;pect to external &s;plendor, &s;o much adopt|ed in tho&s;e churches. The Prie&s;t, upon approaching the altar, inve&s;ts him&s;elf in a rich embroidered cope, and al&s;o officiates according to many Roman Catholic cu&s;toms. Above the altar-table, the a&s;cen&s;ion of our Saviour is re|pre&s;ented in &s;olid gold, inlaid with &s;ilver of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, well worth the traveller's attention. There were many crucifixes of &s;olid &s;ilver and gold.</P>
<P>Afterwards we were conducted to the church of Rede&s;|holm, where lie interred many of the Swedi&s;h Kings. The &s;epulchre of Charles XII. had been attempted to be open|ed, out of curio&s;ity, when Prince Henry of Pru&s;ia vi&s;ited Stockholm, about twenty years ago, but being of marble and the lid beginning to break, they de&s;i&s;ted. The Lutherans are very rigid in their attendance upon di|vine &s;ervice, but when that is over, as in France and other foreign countries, they go to plays, operas, and all kind of amu&s;ements.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="39">On the 12th. we dined with the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, where a Swedi&s;h Admiral, &s;everal Officers of de&s;tinction, and many Engli&s;h Gentlemen, were pre&s;ent. Sir Tho|mas paid us the compliment of inviting many of our own countrymen to his table that he might give us an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> dinner; but alas! that proved merely nominal, as it all underwent a Swedi&s;h di&s;gui&s;e.</P>

<P>I Take the liberty of continuing in this Letter my mi&s;|cellaneous remarks on this country, which, I expect, you mu&s;t receive with no &s;mall degree of indulgence, as many of them are the re&s;ult of ha&s;ty ob&s;ervation. I would not have it under&s;tood that the Swedi&s;h Ladies, in general, are di&s;gu&s;ting to an Engli&s;h ta&s;te. There are many who&s;e education and accompli&s;hments are as di&s;|tingui&s;hed as their birth, and who&s;e affable temper and di&s;po&s;ition render them perfectly amiable. The&s;e qualifi|cations a &s;tranger to their language cannot always enjoy. They po&s;&s;e&s;s no &s;mall &s;hare of vivacity, wit, and affability, with many other accompli&s;hments; and to the&s;e we mu&s;t add, the greate&s;t delicacy of manners. 'Tis true their mode of dre&s;s appears at fir&s;t &s;ight rather &s;ingular to a &s;tranger, as in &s;ome degree dive&s;ting them of elegance; but that &s;oon wears off and becomes reconciled to us by fa&s;hion, the modern corrector of all ab&s;urdities. In honor and ju&s;tification of the Swedi&s;h Fair, this peculiar merit
<PB N="25" REF="41">mu&s;t certainly be allowed them, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;tability of temper and are by no means prone to frequent and fanta&s;tic changes either of mind or apparel; neither are they &s;ubject to the extremes of decoration but ob&s;erve a &s;trict mediocrity. They are not actuated by that &s;pirit of Emulation which we may ob&s;erve in &s;ome countries that we know, neither do they endeavor to exceed or excel one another in di&s;tinctions of this trifling nature.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic is e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t polite accompli&s;h|ments among the Ladies; it is indeed almo&s;t a general Science in this country. Many of their mu&s;ic Ma&s;ters are held in high repute, and that vocation is thought &s;o honorable as to introduce them to all a&s;&s;emblies, with peo|ple of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. The Church mu&s;ic of the Swedes, in&s;pires the mind with religious awe. It operates, however, often too powerfully on weak minds and pro|duces more the &s;hew than the true &s;pirit of Religion.</P>
<P>It is not my intention, however, to deny the power of Mu&s;ic in di&s;po&s;ing the mind to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and adding to the very &s;pirit of devotion. Milton, who, we all know,
<PB N="26" REF="42">was not over fond of the external decorations of Religion as practi&s;ed in the Church of England, yet allows the power of Harmony in this re&s;pect. After de&s;cribing the <HI>&s;tudious Cloi&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>high embowred roof,</HI> the <HI>antique Pillars</HI> and <HI>&s;toried Windows, ca&s;ting,</HI> as he &s;ays, <HI>a dim religious light;</HI> he adds
<Q><L>There let the pealing organ blow</L>
<L>To the full voic'd quire below,</L>
<L>In Service high and Anthems clear,</L>
<L>As may with &s;weetne&s;s through mine Ear</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;olve me into exta&s;ies</L>
<L>And bring all Heav'n before mine Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>Much credit is due to this nation with re&s;pect to the Education and training up of young people &s;o as to ren|der them u&s;eful members of Society. They are particu|larly attentive to the Education of the inferior cla&s;&s;es of people; for which beneficial purpo&s;e they have in&s;tituted &s;eminaries and &s;chools, which are carefully in&s;pected by the &s;uperior and dignified Clergy. When a youth attains a certain age, &s;o as to be capable either of trade or any profe&s;&s;ional line of life, if he &s;hews any particular marks
<PB N="27" REF="43">of genius, or an uncommon a&s;&s;iduity in any of the walks of Science, the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical directors report him to the King who gives orders, as the reward of his merit, that he may receive an Education &s;uitably adapted to his temper and the bent of his inclination. If he continues his diligence and attention, his promotion his certain. This truly laudable in&s;titution and exemplary pattern may well be thought worthy the imitation of more enlightened nations, as it is certainly productive of much emulation and improvement. To dig the rough diamond from the mine is doubtle&s;s a commendable labor, but to poli&s;h it and make it fit for u&s;e de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;es.</P>

<P>THE Diet of the State, which is &s;itting at this time, con&s;i&s;ts of the King and general E&s;tates of the Kingdom, which are thus divided: Fir&s;t, the Nobility. Secondly, the Clergy. Thirdly, the Burgers. And fourth|ly, the Pea&s;ants. Every military per&s;on of rank, from a General to a Captain, has the privilege of &s;itting in Council and giving his vote. The Clergy elect from their deaneries and &s;eparate pari&s;hes a certain number, who, with the Bi&s;hops and inferior Clergy, repre&s;ent that Body. Every Corporation elects the Burgers to repre|&s;ent them. From Stockholm, as it is the capital, and containing the large&s;t number of Inhabitants they have double the number, which, when united, form a large and con&s;iderable Body. The Pea&s;ants, who chu&s;e one of their own people from every pari&s;h to repre&s;ent them, take al&s;o their &s;eat in Diet.</P>
<P>When the King convenes the Diet, which he generally
<PB N="29" REF="45">does on particular and emergent occa&s;ions, the A&s;&s;embly meet at Stockholm in a very elegant Edifice built for this purpo&s;e. Their method of proceeding is this: His Maje&s;ty informs them by a &s;peech from the throne of the cau&s;e of their convention; they then divide and &s;eparate into four different chambers, the Nobles into a hou&s;e of their own, the Clergy into the cathedral, the Burgers and Pea&s;ants into another building acro&s;s the market-place. In their &s;everal chambers they con&s;ider the matter in que&s;tion and give their a&s;&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent. The vote is carried by a majority. Every chamber has a negative in pa&s;&s;ing a law. After each of the States has come to a determination they return in regular order from the &s;eparate chambers to the Diet-hou&s;e, where the King &s;its and receives their deci|&s;ive votes.</P>
<P>I could not but remark the pomp of their proce&s;&s;ion from the Council chamber to the Diet-hou&s;e. They are arranged in great form and the Town guard turns out un|der arms as they pa&s;s. The fir&s;t Noble, venerable in age and dre&s;&s;ed in the court fa&s;hion, went fir&s;t; the re&s;t of the Nobility in pairs after; then the Archbi&s;hop of Up&s;ala, a
<PB N="30" REF="46">man of a very reverend and apo&s;tolic appearance with a gold chain about his neck; the other Bi&s;hops and Clergy two and two; then the principal Magi&s;trate of Stockholm at the head of the Burgers; and la&s;tly, the poor Pea&s;ants, the &s;ingularity of who&s;e apparel and lank hair formed a remarkable contra&s;t with tho&s;e who went before. Yet, tho' appearances don't favor tho&s;e people, I was well informed that they are far from being deficient in the politics of their own country, and wonderfully &s;killed in the know|ledge of their own national con&s;titution. They are firm in opinion, neither to be bribed or bia&s;&s;ed, but adhere &s;trict|ly to the wellfare and credit of their nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are particularly and mo&s;t vigourou&s;ly at|tentive to the actions and honor of the Senate, which is compo&s;ed of fourteen Senators. Tho' the Pea&s;ants them|&s;elves are excluded from voting for the election of a Senator, yet the Senate is always accountable to the Diet, of which they make a part, for every tran&s;action of its admini&s;tration. So that the Pea&s;ants have the power of checking the irregularity or encroaching power of a pre&s;umptuous Noble. Neither will they admit the mo&s;t tri|&s;ling infringement of any con&s;titutional privilege whatever.
<PB N="31" REF="47">Rights of &s;uch importance, tho' ve&s;ted, as may be im|agined, in an illiterate race of people, produce the good effects of decorum and a well regulated government.</P>
<P>A Senator is appointed as pre&s;ident to every court of ju&s;tice, and a council, to manage and regulate all boards e&s;tabli&s;hed for the u&s;e of public revenues; &s;uch as military offices, marine departments, and all other civil and com|mercial appointments. Their laws are comprized in a &s;mall compa&s;s, and &s;eldom &s;ubject them to the di&s;turbance of litigation; &s;o that the profe&s;&s;ion of the long robe in Sweden is of &s;mall repute.</P>

<P>HIS Maje&s;ty's late animated and enterprizing attempt for a revolution &s;ucceeded to a certain degree, but not &s;o far as to introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h an unlimited mo|narchy. He gained the Soldiers, and many of his Subjects joined his party and took the oaths of allegiance in con|&s;equence of a mo&s;t nervous and &s;pirited addre&s;s which he made to his people. His elocution, affable manner, and great conde&s;cen&s;ion, which indeed was only a&s;&s;umed to &s;erve his turn, rendered him the idol of his country, and what added more to the patriotic zeal which they &s;hewed for him, was, that he was a native of Sweden. His per&s;on is rather low but well made and active. It is very &s;ingular that of one &s;ide of his face does not at all re&s;emble the other. He delights much in military exerci&s;es and forms an annual camp at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Stockholm, where he dedicates his time to military improvements.</P>
<P>The want of population, which is very much the ca&s;e in Sweden, and above all, the want of current coin, will
<PB N="33" REF="49">always give a mo&s;t effectual check to monarchical ambi|bition. Tho' the King maintains, and per&s;onally in&s;pects the mo&s;t minute department of State, and attaches him|&s;elf to every frugal &s;y&s;tem of regal management, yet all is not &s;ufficient to effect his purpo&s;es. Nece&s;&s;ity is a plea which even Kings cannot re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Whether this was the rea&s;on, or whether he &s;u&s;pected &s;ome impo&s;ition in the management of the public revenues, and particulaly in that of di&s;tilled Spirits, or whether he had an eye only to his own private emolument, certain it is, that his Maje&s;ty i&s;&s;ued an edict for di&s;continuing every di&s;tillery of &s;pirituous liquors throughout the King|dom. A &s;econd ordinance was immediately proclaimed for erecting di&s;tilleries of his own in every province and laying a &s;evere penalty on tho&s;e who dared to manufac|ture their own brandy. This Expectation of increa&s;ing wealth &s;oon vani&s;hed and proved but an additional cala|mity. Partly from his own injudicious management, and partly from the impo&s;itions of tho&s;e he employed, he &s;oon found the ill Effects of his Schemes. Doubtle&s;s, from &s;uch a precipitate mi&s;conduct, it was natural to
<PB N="34" REF="50">imagine, that many and great di&s;&s;entions would have ari|&s;en among the People. Such di&s;contents his Maje&s;ty was aware of, and to appea&s;e them ordered a reduction of the price from &s;even Shillings per Gallon to three Shillings and Sixpence. This &s;till had not the de&s;ired effect, but on the contrary proved the con&s;equence of more imme|diate ruin. This want of commercial knowledge plunged him in &s;erious and unfor&s;een dificulties, till at length it determined him to an application to Diet for relief. How far the&s;e ari&s;tocratical people complied with his de&s;ires, how far the exigences of his &s;ituation were relieved, or whether any &s;upply was granted, has not yet tran&s;pired.</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t I gave you an account of the tran&s;actions that have been pa&s;&s;ing between the King and the Diet. I can now inform you that this powerful A&s;&s;embly, men, venerable in office, and ready to oppo&s;e every apparent principle of de&s;poti&s;m, refu&s;ed to comply with a &s;cheme which he laid before them for a general liquidation of the royal debts. A further impropriety of conduct his Ma|je&s;ty was guilty of, in attempting to exact from his Country, a more exorbitant Sum to defray (as he &s;aid) his expences to England. This was equally di&s;approved of by the haughty Swedes, who immediately and em|phatically pronounced a general negative. Further appeals were then unnece&s;&s;ary, and all addre&s;&s;es to his ob&s;tinate Countrymen proved ineffectual.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment was not well reli&s;hed, and indeed incurred the royal di&s;plea&s;ure. Being a man of a warm and impetuous di&s;po&s;ition, his Maje&s;ty di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Diet
<PB N="36" REF="52">with a very &s;pirited Speech cen&s;uring their mea&s;ures and di&s;approving of their oppo&s;ition to him. After this he retired to the Camp and did not return to Stockholm for &s;ome days. This had likely to have terminated in a very &s;erious manner, but by the proper and timely inter|ference of good Mini&s;ters, tranquillity was at length happily re&s;tored to this Court.</P>
<P>Though the imprudence of his Maje&s;ty's conduct may frequently throw a &s;hade over &s;ome parts of his character, yet he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many good qualities which more than counterbalance the&s;e failings, and indeed add a brilliancy to his many di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues. He is firm in friend|&s;hip and always ready mo&s;t liberally to recompen&s;e the fidelity of his Servants, &s;o far as pecuniary ability will permit. When this cannot be done, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, he very judiciou&s;ly confers honors and di&s;|tinctions, titles, &s;tars, and ribbons. The&s;e honors he confers promi&s;cuou&s;ly on all ranks and &s;tations; neither regarding birth or any family di&s;tinction whatever. This Policy, adopted now by the Sovereigns of mo&s;t coun|tries, rewards merit at a &s;mall expence and procures an
<PB N="37" REF="53">additional number of retainers to the Court. He u&s;es the &s;ame means for the encouragement of literature and in promoting the Arts and Sciences. In this country, and a happy di&s;tinction it is, even the lowe&s;t Mechanic is encouraged by a reward, equal to the ingenuity which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. This proper policy cannot fail in the end of producing good effects throughout the Swedi&s;h do|minions, and affords an Example worthy the imitation of the mo&s;t civilized Kingdoms.</P>

<P>THE late Dowager Queen, who was Si&s;ter to his late Maje&s;ty of Pru&s;ia, oppo&s;ed many of the pre&s;ent King's public mea&s;ures, and &s;hewed great di&s;approbation of her Sons partiality to the cu&s;toms and manners of the French; which, as it was likely, did not fail to give the French &s;everal advantages, the con&s;equence of &s;uch delu|&s;ion. That politic people, in this ca&s;e did not omit the improvement of &s;o favorable an opportunity of advancing their intere&s;ts. At length by gradual approaches and un&s;u&s;pected &s;ubtilty they made an invaluable purcha&s;e and became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of a great part of the Harbour of Gottenburg. This &s;o greatly di&s;plea&s;ed the Dowager Queen, that, from that time, &s;he ab&s;ented her&s;elf from the Court and retired to the &s;mall, but beautiful, Palace built in the Garden at Drodenholm.</P>
<P>It would be wrong to pa&s;s over the character of this Lady in &s;ilence. She partook of many of the &s;trong
<PB N="39" REF="55">mental qualities of her Brother. She was not only well &s;kil|led in all the parts of profound literature, but her unlimi|ted knowledge extended through every &s;y&s;tem of politics. Early in life &s;he took much delight in the cultivation of a &s;trong natural under&s;tanding, which &s;he continued to improve to her death. That &s;he might have a retirement proper for this purpo&s;e &s;he built this &s;mall Palace in the Garden at Drodenholm, which is elegant and of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Architecture. The Chine&s;e ta&s;te prevails mo&s;t; there are &s;everal apartments decorated with mandarins, china-va&s;es and various ornaments which highly compli|ment her ta&s;te and judgement. In this retirement &s;he dedicated her time to books, and by inde&s;atigable &s;tudy became a proficient in almo&s;t every language, but parti|cularly in the Latin tongue, which, it is &s;aid, &s;he thoroughly under&s;tood. The library, which is of her own collection and extremely well cho&s;en, is now a &s;tanding te&s;timony of her genius. Her private charac|ter, whatever may have been &s;aid by the tongue of flander, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to inve&s;tigate.</P>
<P>To-morrow we intend to pur&s;ue our Journey to

<P>UPSALA, where we arrived this morning on our road to Lapland, is the fir&s;t Univer&s;ity of eminence and repute in Sweden. Many Foreigners and Students of different nations, even from England, re&s;ort here for Education. The profe&s;&s;ors of &s;cience and language are men of unque&s;tionable abilities, and of great reputation for learning. I had the plea&s;ure of dining with two of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ional Gentlemen. In&s;tead, as I expected, of finding them a formal and preci&s;e people, I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee them &s;et a&s;ide every unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;erve, and with the greate&s;t politene&s;s, freedom, and good hu|mour entertain us with every information which we wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The City of Up&s;ala is a plea&s;ant and healthful &s;ituation: in the lower part of the City there is a fine &s;quare which forms the market-place; on an eminence is the ca&s;tle which con&s;i&s;ts of many beautiful and lofty buildings
<PB N="42" REF="59">chiefly of wood, commanding a di&s;tant but mo&s;t exten|&s;ive view of the Gulf of Bothnia; from hence there is a mo&s;t commodious communication with Stockholm. The much renowned Linaeus fir&s;t formed here his celebrated Botanical Garden. It affords no extraordinary appear|ance to a &s;tranger ignorant of Botany, but is matter of much curio&s;ity to &s;tudents in that Science.</P>
<P>The Fair in this place will not allow them&s;elves to pa&s;s unob&s;erved. I &s;hould not therefore excu&s;e my&s;elf of rudene&s;s, if I were to omit the lea&s;t appearance of re&s;pect. They &s;hew great attention to &s;trangers and a&s;&s;ume a peculiar gaiety which in England might have the appearance of levity. It may not, however, appear &s;o very extraordinary that the&s;e Ladies &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome knowledge of the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, having all the advan|tage of a <HI>College Education.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as a particular want of re&s;pect to the married Ladies of Up&s;ala, if I remark that at this place &s;ome fell under our ob&s;ervation, who&s;e conduct and behaviour, &s;till le&s;s obeyed the rules of decorum, than
<PB N="43" REF="60">the unmarried Fair ones I have already mentioned. I am not the fir&s;t Traveller that has had occa&s;ion to make this remark, not on Sweden only, but on many of the North|ern Kingdoms, particularly Germany. Whatever rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned for this it is certainly true. And it would be well if in more fa&s;hionable countries, the Ma&s;k of Matrimony were not &s;o frequently made u&s;e of, as a covering for Levity and Di&s;&s;ipation, a &s;kreen for the improper Indulgence of licentious Inclinations.</P>
<P>This celebrated City and Univer&s;ity de&s;erves a more particular attention than I am at pre&s;ent able to be&s;tow upon it. When we return, which we &s;hall do, through this place, I will endeavour to give you a better account of its Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>I Write this from a Village on the road that I may not interrupt the narrative of our Journey. I &s;hall re|&s;ume my pen when we become more &s;tationary.</P>
<P>We left Up&s;ala early in the morning on the 14th. of June, and attempted to dine at a dirty Village about noon, but alas! nothing comfortable was to be met with. But tho' our palates this day received no gratification, our eyes certainly did, from pro&s;pects the mo&s;t romantic and entertaining. We travelled for many miles by the &s;ide of a very beautiful and exten&s;ive Lake, and pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t wonderful and picture&s;que cataract called Elkerby fall. In the evening we arrived at Gefle. Gefle is a Seaport &s;ituated on the Gulf of Bothnia an arm of the Baltic Sea. There appeared more indu&s;try in the cul|tivation of Land here, than in any part of this country which we had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed. Leaving behind us the&s;e traces of civilized life we entered into woods that did not terminate for many miles.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="62">The next day we continued our Journey, as before, through almo&s;t endle&s;s woods, and pa&s;&s;ed a variety of Lakes, one of which we were obliged to cro&s;s in a Ferry about half a mile over. The Swedi&s;h Watermen, who are neither expeditious nor expert, greatly impeded our Journey. About eleven at night we arrived at a town called Ig&s;und. We had Letters of recommendation to a Gentleman of that place, by whom we were mo&s;t policely received and ho&s;pitably treated. The town of Igfund tho' in it&s;elf &s;mall, yet very exten&s;ive Ironworks are carried on here, the property of Merchants in Stockholm. After breakfa&s;ting the next morning with our ho&s;pitable friend and his Lady we left Ig&s;und and travelled through a country full of rocks and precipices, deep and heavy &s;ands, with little variety. The Woods, as u&s;ual, were very exten&s;ive. Some &s;mall Villages are &s;cattered upon the borders of the Lakes which are inhabited by Boors who&s;e &s;ole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends upon the fi&s;h they can procure from the Lake on which they live. They have very little corn, and in order to increa&s;e the quantity of food they mix it up and grind it with the thin rind or inward bark of the fir-tree; afterwards they form it into thin large cakes. Tho' their diet is very meagre yet
<PB N="46" REF="63">they are a large, bony, athletic people, capable of bearing much fatigue.</P>
<P>The Woods here are remarkably exten&s;ive and thick, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to harbour more wild bea&s;ts than any other part of Sweden. We were informed of a melan|choly in&s;tance of the ferocity of the&s;e wild animals near a neighbouring Village while we were there. Two un|&s;ortunate Girls, attending their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds in the wood, were both devoured by a ravenous &s;he-bear and her young, which the day before had been &s;een prowling for prey.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night we reached Sunval a Sea-port town upon the &s;ame Gulf. The trade of this place chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the building of Ships, which is very conveni|ent on account of its near &s;ituation to &s;uch exten&s;ive and fine fore&s;ts. It neither imports nor exports any thing, except tar, which they extract from their firs.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 17th. we cro&s;&s;ed two &s;erries and pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t mountainous country. The hills on
<PB N="47" REF="64">every &s;ide were almo&s;t precipices, altogether inacce&s;&s;ible. This day we dined at an in&s;ignificant Village where we unexpectedly met with tolerable accommodations. In the afternoon we cro&s;&s;ed a Lake, a mile and a half long. The country to Dog&s;tau, where we &s;lept, was almo&s;t a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;teep rocks and barren hills, which delayed us much, for which rea&s;on we did not reach that place till two in the morning, where we found accommo|dations of every kind exceeding bad. Here we delayed not long but left Dog&s;tau very early, and pa&s;&s;ed under an exceeding high rock at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance from the town. The &s;ummit of this rock is much re&s;orted to by &s;trangers, to &s;ee the Sun at midnight.</P>
<P>We dined at a neat Village; the hou&s;e was uncom|monly clean, and we were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with un|looked for delicacies, &s;uch as, a variety of wild fowl, eggs, chaders, &amp;c. From hence we made a &s;low progre&s;s in travelling, as the roads were deep and &s;andy, and arrived at Le&s;ver the &s;ame night, a town &s;ituated in a wretched country, the Land producing no corn for three years pa&s;t. This circum&s;tance threatens them with the dreadful con|&s;equences of a general Famine; a calamity too often experienced in this mi&s;erable country.</P>

<P>THIS morning we entered Uma, a beautiful well|built town, &s;ituated upon a fine River of the &s;ame name, where Ships are built of large burthen. The river runs on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town and empties it&s;elf into the Gulf of Bothnia. It gives its name to a part of Swedi&s;h Lapland in which it has its &s;ource, from hence called Uma Lapmark. It is too broad to admit of a bridge which renders the pa&s;&s;age very incommodious, as the ferries are very bad and ill &s;upplied. The Govern|or of We&s;t Bothnia re&s;ides here, which is about two hundred and eighty miles north of Stockholm.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night we arrived at Richlea the fir&s;t town at which we &s;lept in Lapland. The roads here are like tho&s;e we had left with rocks, woods, and, in the height of Summer, burning &s;ands. The town of Richlea vies with, and indeed far &s;urpa&s;&s;es, the towns in the Swedi&s;h territories in dirt and poverty. Beds, there were indeed,
<PB N="49" REF="66">if &s;uch they may be called, which we lay upon, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fatigue contrived to &s;leep till morning. By day we were bit by the Mu&s;queto-fly and during the night by in&s;ects of a nature equally di&s;agreeable to our feelings. Our faces, legs, and bodies were &s;o immode|rately &s;welled as to render us truly pitiable objects. We left that place to free our&s;elves from &s;uch an uncomfort|able &s;ituation, as early as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the next day we arrived very early at a &s;mall Village called Gumboda. Here we were entertained with an Encampment of Swedi&s;h Soldiers which made a very indifferent military appearance. From their awk|wardne&s;s and apparent want of di&s;cipline I took them for &s;ome new rai&s;ed Lapland Militia. We &s;lept that night at Sunana, where we found an excellent Inn. Every thing, much to our &s;urpri&s;e, was uncommonly clean for that country. The Landlady &s;eemed very de&s;irous to plea&s;e; that circum&s;tance could only be gue&s;&s;ed at from her actions, as an entire ignorance of the language of the country rendered any other intercour&s;e impracticable.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="67">Our Journey the next day was much retarded by the wilful negligence of tho&s;e Boors who are obliged to &s;upply all Travellers with hor&s;es. A negligence in this re&s;pect &s;ubjects them either to corporal puni&s;hment or a pecuniary fine. On which account, the Traveller &s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a book which is kept for this purpo&s;e, and at the &s;ame time particularly notes how long he had been detained by their neglect. This book mu&s;t be produced at every quarterly meeting of their Magi&s;trates, who regulate every puni&s;hment according to the de&s;ert of the offender. Were it not for the &s;trictne&s;s of this regulation no foreign+er could commodiou&s;ly travel, but mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the greate&s;t impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>This country abounds in Lakes and Rivers which, though particularly beautiful and romantic, greatly hin|dered the progre&s;s of our Journey, as we were obliged to pa&s;s over many of them. For which rea&s;on we did not arrive at Pithia till five in the afternoon. Here we dined at the Burgo-ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, were genteelly received, and &s;et down to a very <HI>&s;light</HI> dinner which we quickly di&s;|patched. Pithia, like Uma, gives its name to a Province
<PB N="51" REF="68">of Swedi&s;h Lapland, is &s;ituated upon a river of the &s;ame name which ri&s;es in the Lapland mountains, and runs into the Gulf of Bothnia.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;et out for Erna&s;to, where we arrived the &s;ame night, but finding the beds damp we were obliged to &s;leep in our cloaths. From this circum&s;tance you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed that we were very &s;oon ready to pur&s;ue our Journey in the morning. The town of Pithia is perhaps one of the large&s;t and be&s;t built towns in Lapland. It is governed by a Burgo-ma&s;ter and twelve Rodmen. This place has more the appearance, than the reality, of trade, though extremely well &s;ituated for that purpo&s;e. It is &s;urrounded by a fine navigable water which communicates with many Lakes and Rivers. The Inhabitants &s;eem to be an inanimate &s;ort of people, neither de&s;irous to plea&s;e nor giving them&s;elves much trouble to &s;hew their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>AFTER leaving Pithia and pa&s;&s;ing over a large extent of country, very little of which is good, the great|er part, bad, and indifferent, a better pro&s;pect pre&s;ents it&s;elf before us. Here Plenty might have been expected from the apparent good quality of the &s;oil if the people were inclined to indu&s;try. But, alas! on account of their indolence, and ignorance in the art of Agriculture, Poverty, &s;canty Poverty, continues to oppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>After cro&s;&s;ing a very indifferent Ferry we arrived at a &s;mall but neat town called Gambel&s;taden, where it is recorded, that King Charles XI. of Sweden, on his return from Tornao, humourou&s;ly declared, that he had in his tour met with three very extraordinary circum&s;tances; the fir&s;t was, &s;eeing the Sun at midnight at Tornao; the &s;econd, that in cro&s;&s;ing the Ferry, a large Salmon leaped into the boat; and la&s;tly, that when he attended divine
<PB N="53" REF="70">Service at Gambel&s;taden, the pari&s;h Mini&s;ter a&s;cended the ro&s;trum to preach before him, but being overcome by diffidence, and awed by the pre&s;ence of Maje&s;ty, re|turned again to his &s;eat without uttering a word. Here we vi&s;ited the church, which is a &s;pacious building &s;u|perbly ornamented with gaudy grandeur.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night we &s;lept at Grot. The Clergyman of the pari&s;h was the Landlord. Not far from this place we ob&s;erved two criminals &s;tretched upon the Wheel for murder. Capital executions are not common in this country, and indeed are but &s;eldom inflicted, except in ca&s;es of murder. On &s;uch occa&s;ions only they have not yet laid a&s;ide the u&s;e of torture, a proof, among others, that the Government of Sweden has not yet attained that degree of refinement which in more &s;outhern Kingdoms every where prevails.</P>
<P>The morning following, after pa&s;&s;ing a noble river, we en|tered Finland. The country here is deep and &s;andy, and of cour&s;e barren and unfruitful. The Inhabitants are to ap|pearance rough, and their manners uncultivated to a great
<PB N="54" REF="71">degree; but though to a &s;tranger they appear ignorant, yet they are &s;ufficiently knowing where their own intere&s;t is concerned. This day we arrived at Tornao, a beautiful well built town &s;urrounded by a river of the &s;ame name, or rather the river here &s;wells into a &s;pacious Lake. This water produces a great quantity of Salmon of un|common weight and &s;ize. This town is the place of re&s;idence of many capital merchants. The principal trade here con&s;i&s;ts of tar and furs of all kinds, brought down from the high country by the Laplanders, which they barter for cloth, hardware and other merchandize.</P>
<P>At twelve o'clock this night we &s;aw the Sun in full beauty. The Horizon being remarkably clear, gave us a mo&s;t delightful view of that, <HI>to us,</HI> extraordinary &s;ight. Sir H. G. L. has cau&s;ed an engraving to be made of this agreeable Scene.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the fronti&s;piece.</NOTE> The Inhabitants of this climate no doubt reap many advantages from this circum&s;tance during the Summer &s;ea&s;on; but, alas! a long and dreary Winter rever&s;es the &s;cene and involves them in continu|al darkne&s;s. Yet this is not quite &s;o di&s;mal as might be imagined. The aurora borealis appears with peculiar
<PB N="55" REF="72">&s;plendor in all northern countries and &s;upplies in &s;ome degree the place of the Sun. The &s;tars too in their clear fro&s;ty nights &s;hed an agreeable light, and enable them without much impediment to follow many of their or|dinary occupations.</P>

<P>AS we had great need of re&s;t, after a Journey of eight hundred miles through a country de&s;titute of every comfort and convenience of life, it was thought expedi|ent to halt at this place ye&s;terday and to-day. This town is &s;ituated on the confines of Finland. The lan|guages both of the Laplanders and the Finlanders are &s;poken here. Our interpreter being well &s;killed in all the dialects of this country we met with fewer difficulties in the common cour&s;e of things than we had rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="73">This day we attended the Church which &s;tands at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town. It is a &s;mall but neat building, and the benefice about eighty pounds per annum. Few church preferments in this country are of greater value. In the afternoon we received an invitation from the Judge's lady to drink coffee, the Judge him&s;elf then at|tending the Diet at Stockholm. We accepted the invita|tion and were mo&s;t politely received by the lady. Her dre&s;s was very &s;uperb having a gold chain about her neck, a diamond cro&s;s, ear rings, and a variety of preci|ous &s;tones on every finger. Her ve&s;tment was a rich brocade, very &s;hort, after the country fa&s;hion. In the evening we were introduced to a grand ball, where we were much entertained with their peculiar manner of dancing. Soon after, the Judge's Lady made her ap|pearance; when &s;he entered the room the company all ro&s;e and paid her much re&s;pect: from this it may be imagined that &s;he is con&s;idered as a per&s;on of no &s;mall con&s;equence in this place. Though &s;he was not now in the meridian of youth and beauty, &s;he danced minuets, cotillions, and many of their own country dances, with uncommon activity and &s;pirit. The Inhabitants of this place, though living as it were at a great di&s;tance from
<PB N="57" REF="74">poli&s;hed Society, are far from being an unpoli&s;hed People. The ma&s;ter of the ceremonies paid us the utmo&s;t re&s;pect and attention. Being ignorant of their cu&s;toms, we were, according to the Engli&s;h Phra&s;e, going to take a French leave, but were given to under&s;tand that it would be deem|ed the highe&s;t di&s;re&s;pect if we did not particularly &s;alute the Judge's Lady and make a general obei&s;ance to the whole company. With this ceremony, though by no means plea&s;ant to us, we were obliged to comply.</P>
<P>Tornao is the chief town of We&s;t Bothnia, about three hundred and twenty miles north ea&s;t of St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckholm, &s;itua|ted on a river of the &s;ame name, which ri&s;es in Lapland, runs &s;outh ea&s;t, and falls at Tornao into the Gulf of Both|nia.

<P>IT is our fortune to be at Tornao on Mid&s;ummer day&mdash;a day always celebrated with the greate&s;t Fe&s;tivity in Sweden. The Boors flock to this place in great numbers from the &s;urrounding country and endeavour to amu&s;e them&s;elves in various ways. Their curio&s;ity has been very much excited by Sir H. G. L.'s Landaw, which they have viewed with much admiration. They are al&s;o as de&s;irous of &s;eeing us as we can po&s;&s;ibly be of ob&s;erving them. For this purpo&s;e, through ignorance or curio&s;ity, I will not call it impertinence, they are continually &s;taring at us through the windows of our dining room.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now relate an Adventure, though of no great im|portance, yet as it amu&s;ed us, I &s;hall have your pardon for &s;o doing. In the evening a &s;tout Finlander laid his elbows upon the window, and without much ceremony<PB N="59" REF="76">called to us frequently for brandy. We nodded to him as we were drinking our wine, while he continued to re|peat his former reque&s;t in his own language, <HI>Anna ma vino, Hurra Kultana,</HI> "Dear Gentlemen, give me brandy." Sir H. with great good nature complied with his reque&s;t, and gave him two or three gla&s;&s;es which he &s;eemed to enjoy very much, but &s;till he called, <HI>Hurra Kul|tana.</HI> A few gla&s;&s;es more were given him, which made him drop his elbow from the window, and rather grow &s;horter. As his legs would not bear him up, he bent his knees again&s;t the wall, and by the help of his hands he &s;upported him&s;elf, by holding fa&s;t by the window po&s;t; but &s;till he called, <HI>Hurra Kultana.</HI> Two gla&s;&s;es more were given him, till at length he could &s;ay nothing but <HI>Kultana, Kultana,</HI> and gradually &s;unk from the window.</P>
<P>When his countrymen who were &s;tanding around &s;aw him drop, they took him carefully up and carried him away. Word, however, was &s;oon brought that the man was &s;o ill that they expected his throat would &s;oon be on fire, and if he did not recover before the morning, our po&s;t hor&s;es would be &s;topped and our Journey prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="77">Our anxiety was removed in an hour or two's time by the man's appearance once more upon the &s;tage. He came into the yard and began to play &s;everal anticks, and to &s;hew us how the Bear dances in the fields.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock the &s;ame night the much renown|ed Profe&s;&s;or Helands waited on Sir Harry. His counte|nance and appearance &s;hewed that he was a true born &s;on of Lapland. His age about &s;ixty nine. He &s;poke the French language tolerably well, and &s;aid many hand|&s;ome things of the Engli&s;h nation. He informed us how many Engli&s;h Gentlemen had vi&s;ited Tornao in his time, and &s;hewed us Letters he had received from per&s;ons of rank in London.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance concerning him I cannot omit mentioning, to &s;hew the high e&s;timation in which learning is held and the credulity of the common people, as well as the veneration which is paid in unenlightened nations to men of &s;uperior knowledge. We were informed, and I believe the circum&s;tance was entirely cre|dited by the per&s;on who told us, that for his winter
<PB N="61" REF="78">amu&s;ement this learned Profe&s;&s;or had taught a &s;warm of Bees to hunt, and even to kill, mice. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far the minds of the ignorant may be impo&s;ed upon. It is not perhaps many centuries ago that this &s;tory would have found Believers even in England.</P>
<P>We walked in the evening to the &s;ide of the river to &s;ee the Finlanders draw their nets at the Salmon Fi&s;hery. They form an Enclo&s;ure with Poles driven down in the water, the length of which is three hundred yards, the breadth one hundred, with only one entrance for the Sal|mon. Every two hours they draw their net and generally catch about forty or fifty Salmon at a time. The inhabi|tants of this place pickle and &s;alt it in barrels and export it from hence to all parts of Sweden. A large quantity is &s;moked and dried, and &s;old very cheap. Our Landlord the &s;ame evening bought a large Salmon that weighed twen|ty-one pounds for nine dollars copper (about half a crown.) The Pike is a fi&s;h very abundant at Tornao, and in Lapland. The&s;e al&s;o are dried by the natives and &s;old to the mer|chants for exportation. But of all the fi&s;h which their
<PB N="62" REF="79">water can &s;upply, none is to be compared with the Ruda either for goodne&s;s or for flavour. It re&s;embles the Carp in &s;hape, and is equally plea&s;ant to the palate.</P>

<P>THE Laplanders in general are below the middle &s;ta|ture, with flat faces, high cheek bones, long black hair, and their complexions of a mahogany hue. Their habitations are dirty to a great degree, but on account of their un&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed life are portable. They leave an aperture at the top which &s;erves both for window and chimney, and a &s;mall hole on one &s;ide for an entrance. In &s;hort their dwellings are not unlike tho&s;e de&s;cribed in Cook's Voyage of the inhabitants of Kam&s;chatka. The Laplanders are mu&s;cular and active, though at the &s;ame time, which &s;eems to imply a contradiction, they are na|turally idle, but perfectly pacific in their tempers. The Women, likewi&s;e are low, with large broad features, but

<P>The language of the Laplanders is a har&s;h and unintel|ligible Jargon derived from their neighbours, the ancient Inhabitants of Finland. Their voices however are mu&s;ical and they never require much entreaty to oblige. The few &s;pecimens which we po&s;&s;e&s;s of Lapland Poetry, give you a favourable impre&s;&s;ion of their <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> and ta&s;te mo&s;t certainly it is, uncorrupted by foreign Ideas, and entirely the pro|duction of nature.

<P>With re&s;pect to religion I'm affraid the Laplanders have yet much to learn: though like every other quarter of the Globe, Knowledge is making gradual advances even here. The high Laps, as they are called, that is, tho&s;e who inhabit the mountains, have not yet quite forgot their original Pagani&s;m, notwith&s;tanding the great pains which
<PB N="65" REF="82">the Swedes have taken to introduce Chri&s;tianity among&s;t them. Many &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms &s;till remain to pro|claim the darkne&s;s of their minds. Augury and witch|craft make a part of their belief; they &s;till whi&s;per to their Rein-deer when they undertake a Journey, and addre&s;s their ancient Idols for the increa&s;e and &s;afety of their flocks. You have heard no doubt of their conjuring Drums. I met with one in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Prie&s;t at Uma, who had attended a reformed Pagan in his dying moments. His original opinions he had long &s;ince changed, but retained this piece of ancient &s;uper&s;tition to delude the ignorant, and &s;upply his own nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>This In&s;trument is of an oval form, made of the bark of the fir, pine, or birch-tree, one end of which is covered with a &s;ort of parchment dre&s;&s;ed from the Rein-deer &s;kin. This is loaded with bra&s;s rings artfully fa&s;tened to it. The Conjuror then beats it upon his brea&s;t with a variety of frantic po&s;tures. After this he be&s;mears it with blood, and draws upon it rude figures of various kinds. When he has gone through all his manaeuvres, he informs his credulous audience what they wi&s;h to know, which he &s;ays
<PB N="66" REF="83">was communicated to him during the paroxi&s;m of his attitudes. Like other Fortune-tellers, his an&s;wers are generally of a favorable kind, for which he receives pre|&s;ents of brandy, which adds fuel to his frenzy and renders him <HI>mighty wi&s;e.</HI></P>

<P>THE Wealth of the Laplanders con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the Number of Rein-deer. The&s;e draw their Sledges in winter, but in &s;ummer the&s;e animals loo&s;e their vigour and &s;wiftne&s;s, and are ea&s;ily overcome by heat. I have &s;een them reclining in the woods, and apparently &s;o en|feebled, as &s;carcely able to get out of your way. When thus oppre&s;&s;ed they make a noi&s;e re&s;embling the grunt|ing of an hog. Even then the Laplanders make u&s;e of them to tran&s;port their Effects from one &s;tation to another, which they have occa&s;ion to do more frequently in &s;um|mer
<PB REF="84"><FIGURE>
<HEAD>The REIN-DEER.</HEAD>
<P>Drawn from the living Animal</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="67" REF="85">than in winter, as they are then in que&s;t of fertile plains for the maintenance of their numerous flocks.</P>
<P>The Rein-deer is of the &s;hape of a Stag, but rather &s;tronger. The hair light, rather inclining to an a&s;h co|lour. His horns are very long and finely branched. The lower branches, which fall very near the forehead, are &s;aid to be u&s;ed by the animal in breaking the ice, when the waters are frozen over, that he may get drink. His food is &s;hrubs and plants, or mo&s;s and the bark of trees. His legs are very hairy and his hoofs moveable, for he expands and opens them in going. He is an extremely &s;wift, as well as an extremely &s;trong, animal.</P>
<P>After &s;peaking of the rein-deer it is but proper that I &s;hould mention the Sledge which renders them &s;o u&s;eful. The Sledge is formed &s;omething like a boat. Its bottom is convex, of cour&s;e none but a per&s;on well practiced in &s;uch a mode of travelling could pre&s;erve him&s;elf from over&s;etting every moment. It is &s;quare behind, but pro|jecting to a point before. The Traveller is tied in this
<PB N="68" REF="86">Sledge like a child in a cradle. He manages his carriage with great dexterity by means of a &s;tick with a flat end, to remove &s;tones or any ob&s;tructions which he might meet with. In this &s;ituation they travel with great rapidity.</P>
<P>The Laplander is very dexterous in making uten&s;ils of wood. He is his own carpenter and boat-builder. I was not a little &s;urprized, in a tent of wandering Laplanders, to find the chee&s;e which they make of the rein-deer's milk curiou&s;ly impre&s;&s;ed with a wooden in&s;trument &s;uch as is commonly u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h Daries. They fa&s;ten their boards together, when they make their boats or other moveables, with Twigs or the Nerves of the rein-deer. The women al&s;o make u&s;e of the latter as a &s;ub&s;titute for thread in &s;ewing. The female Laplanders &s;hew great in|genuity in embroidering their Garments with bra&s;s-wire, tin, or any other gaudy ornament. They take much de|light in adorning their heads, neck, and &s;houlders with gla&s;s beads, &amp;c. and are very fanciful in their girdles which are embroidered and fringed with large tufts at the two extremes and tied in large knots; this they look upon as the greate&s;t ornament of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="87">The Dre&s;s of Lapland Ladies of &s;uperior rank, &s;uch as are re&s;ident in towns, is equal to their fortunes. This is often very &s;uperb and co&s;tly, whim&s;ically loaded with or|naments, gold and &s;ilver rings, diamonds, and pearls, &amp;c. I have already mentioned the dre&s;s of the Judge's Lady at this place. The ve&s;t of a Lady of Quality is of the riche&s;t brocade &s;ilk, trimmed with ribbons which float round the neck and wai&s;t; the cap, of blue or white &s;atin, wrought with embroidery of various colours. The young women wear a gold ring on the middle finger of the right hand: when they marry it is changed to the left.</P>
<P>There are but very few dogs in Lapland, and the&s;e of a breed peculiar to the country, &s;mall &s;ized, with cur tails and pointed ears, not unlike the wolf dog. They are very u&s;eful to hunters in the woods. They are generally well trained and of wonderful &s;agacity in finding game, particularly the chader and ora. After the bird is &s;prung the dog pur&s;ues and watches its perch, which commonly is upon a high tree. The bird becomes unaccountably fa&s;cinated by the &s;teady po&s;ture and barking of the dog, &s;o that the ma&s;ter has no difficulty in di&s;covering the Object of his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="88">The fi&s;hing Laplanders chu&s;e their habitation upon the &s;hore of one of their Lakes. They are very dexterous in this art: and no wonder, as on this their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends. This however can only be a &s;ummer employ|ment. When the lakes are frozen they are obliged to be|take them&s;elves to their fore&s;ts, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by hunting. The fi&s;h of the&s;e lakes are mo&s;t excellent in quality and flavour, but they know not how to dre&s;s them. The fol|lowing are the names by which the variety of them are known. The Gadda Abborre, Mort, Loyan, Gris, Ruda or Cara&s;&s;ir, a &s;pecies of the carp but much larger: the Stremling, and Negenogon, of the herring kind, but inha|bitants of fre&s;h water; the Lax, (or &s;almon) Skoma-karen, Rudor, Simper and Lake.</P>
<P>When the &s;ea&s;on approaches for curing their fi&s;h for their winter provi&s;ions, they are obliged to take a long and tedious Journey over de&s;erts and mountains to pro|cure Salt at their Sea-port towns. The&s;e Journeys are generally performed in large parties.</P>

<P>FROM the wild appearance of this mountainous region, far from population and cultivated life, the &s;port&s;man may expect the highe&s;t gratification. Wild game indeed of various kinds may be found here in great abundance. It cannot be expected in an excur&s;ion of this kind that I &s;hould give you a complete Natural Hi&s;tory of the coun|tries which I vi&s;it; neither will I pretend to be very accu|rate even in tho&s;e things which I do de&s;cribe. I can only relate what I beheld, and de&s;cribe as well as the circum&s;tances of our &s;ituation would permit.</P>
<P>Among&s;t others, the Kader, or Chader, is a remarkably fine bird, as large as a common turkey. The cock is black: the hen of an orange colour, and not quite &s;o large as the cock. The hen generally lays about eight or ten eggs.
<PB N="72" REF="91">One evening as Sir H. G. L. was out on a &s;hooting party, his dog &s;prung a Chader; upon walking to the place he found her ne&s;t at the foot of a rotten fir-tree with eight eggs in it.&mdash;The Ora nearly re&s;embles our black game in England but larger. But the Hierpe is reckoned the fine&s;t game that can be eaten; in &s;ize it is like a young pigeon; its colour, black, grey and white. <HI>(&s;ee the plate)</HI> The Snoripa is rather larger; for the fir&s;t two years this bird turns white in the winter and grey in the &s;ummer, like the hares in this country. Afterwards it remains al|ways white. This bird makes an extraordinary noi&s;e and particularly at nights. It is not to be found any where but in Lapland, or the neighbouring countries. By &s;ome accident a few years ago this bird happened to make its appearance within an hundred miles of Stockholm, which very much alarmed the common people in the neigh|bourhood where it was found. In &s;hort, from the par|ticular noi&s;e it made at nights a report prevailed among&s;t the vulgar that the wood was haunted by a <HI>Gho&s;t.</HI> So much were they terrified by this invi&s;ible &s;pirit that no|thing could tempt the po&s;t-boys after it was dark to pa&s;s this dreadful wood. This &s;pirit, however, was at la&s;t happily removed by the &s;agacity of &s;ome gentlemen who

The birds I have men|tioned are reckoned great rarities at Stockholm, whither they are &s;ent in the winter and &s;old at very high prices. Be&s;ides the&s;e they have the Moorkulla, Ake&s;hon, Purrhons, Rapphons, Gelenotte, Kneeper, which is a kind of Snipe, and the Yierper.</P>
<P>Woodcocks breed both in Lapland and in Sweden as well as other northern countries. After the breeding Sea&s;on, for a certain time, the woods of Lapland and Fin|land abound with them. The&s;e they call in their language the Sea&s;on-bird, but they neither de&s;troy or eat them, judg|ing them to be unwhole&s;ome food, from the circum&s;tance of their having no crops. It has been an ob&s;ervation in Eng|land that for &s;everal years pa&s;t Woodcocks have become remarkably &s;carce. This may probably be accounted for in the following manner. Sweden like other countries, is making a gradual progre&s;s in the arts of Luxury, among&s;t which the indulgence of the palate takes no undi&s;tingui&s;h|ed place. Wild fowl eggs have of late become a great
<PB N="74" REF="95">delicacy among the inhabitants of that country who en|courage the Boors to &s;ind out their ne&s;ts. The egg of the Woodcock they are particularly fond of, which is about the &s;ize of that of the Plover, and is exceeding rich in fla|vour. I have &s;een the Boors offering large quantities of the&s;e eggs for &s;ale in the market at Stockholm. From this practice it is not improbable but that the Breed of this bird as well as of the Chader, Ora, &amp;c. will be greatly dimini&s;hed, if not at la&s;t totally exterpated. Upon en|quiry, however, I do not find that any alteration in point of quantity has, as yet, been perceived in Lapland.</P>

<P>FROM the number, &s;ize, and retired &s;ituation of the Lapland Lakes it may be imagined that they abound in a variety of aquatic fowls. This po&s;&s;ibly may be the ca&s;e, but in order to be a judge of this it would be nece&s;|&s;ary to take up our abode in the&s;e cold regions during the winter months. There are &s;everal of the Duck &s;pecies to be found here; one I was &s;hewn which had been &s;hot by a boor re&s;embling the Moor-cock in plumage, and which a per&s;on not well ver&s;ed in Natural Hi&s;tory might have mi&s;taken for one, but the bill and feet proved it to be an inhabitant of the waters.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall bird &s;ometimes to be met with in this country and in other northern climates. One of this kind was lately taken near Raven&s;worth ca&s;tle in the
<PB N="76" REF="97">county of Durham, and is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lady Liddell. It is about the &s;ize of a Thru&s;h. This bird is called the Sieben&s;chwantz, or Bohemian Chatterer, a &s;o|litary bird, from whence it is conjectured to have been called the Micro-phoenix. It has a long tail of blue, red and yellow feathers which give it a very glowing appear|ance. On almo&s;t every feather of the wing there is a &s;mall red bright &s;pot, like a drop of red &s;ealing wax. This la&s;t has been particularly ob&s;erved in a bird of the &s;ame &s;ize, though otherwi&s;e le&s;s gaily feathered, in the &s;outhern parts of America. But it &s;eems probable that the&s;e birds are not of the &s;ame kind, as this has a tuft upon its head which does not an&s;wer the de&s;cription of the other. It is not, however, &s;urprizing that birds, who are well provided for long journeys, &s;hould be found in very di&s;tant countries, particularly as it &s;eems within their power to remove from one place to another according to the temperature of different &s;ea&s;ons, or for other rea&s;ons not &s;o evident to men who are unable to judge of their In&s;tincts.</P>
<P>From this country a large quantity of Aedder-down is col|lected
<PB N="77" REF="98">from a duck of that name, to be found only in the northern climes. The Down, is of &s;uch value when in its purity, that it is &s;old for two rix-dollars per pound. It is extremely &s;oft and warm, and &s;o light and apt to ex|pand that two handfulls &s;queezed together are &s;ufficient to fill a Down Quilt, which is a covering like a feather bed u&s;ed in tho&s;e cold countries in&s;tead of a common quilt or blanket.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to mention the Jo-Fugl, a bird re|markable for robbing other birds of their prey, which he is too lazy to look out for him&s;elf. If he cannot intimi|date them by his cry or appearance, he &s;trikes them with his bill &s;o violently on the back, as to cau&s;e them to drop their excrement which he catches as it falls.</P>
<P>The Alk is a bird of the &s;ize of a &s;mall goo&s;e: it will dive twenty fathomas deep in pur&s;uit of herrings, and has &s;ometimes been drawn up by a fi&s;h-hook from that depth.</P>
<P>The Scarv or Loom is a very &s;ingular aquatic bird, about
<PB N="78" REF="99">the &s;ize of a Mu&s;covy duck. The egg after half an hours boiling remains liquid. The boors take the&s;e birds by lighting a fire under the rock where they build. The &s;moke and heat make them giddy, and they drop down in numbers.</P>
<P>Many clu&s;ters of Swallows in their torpid &s;tate, I was cre|dibly informed, are frequently found by &s;i&s;hermen among reeds and bu&s;hes in the Lakes both of Norway and Sweden.</P>
<P>Tho' this country &s;eems to be &s;ituated under an inclem|nent Sky, yet we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that Nature has entire|ly deprived it of the fruits of the Earth. Be&s;ides others which may be found in cold climates the following are the native fruits of Lapland. The A'kerbar, which grows in &s;tony places, and is reckoned a rarity at the fir&s;t Tables in Sweden, it is pre&s;erved and u&s;ed as a de&s;ert, from which al&s;o they make a &s;ort of wine: the Hiortron, which grows in &s;wamps, of the &s;ize of the Ra&s;pberry, is yellow, and ve|ry delicious to the palate: and the Lingon, a fruit not
<PB N="79" REF="100">unlike a Cranbury, but as large again, which is pre&s;erved and generally u&s;ed in Sweden to roa&s;t beef.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts of Lapland produce, in great perfection the &s;pruce and &s;ilver fir. Another &s;pecies has lately been di&s;covered here called the Mazar-tree; it is a tall, thick and u&s;eful timber. The Bole when cut in two is beauti|fully variegated, and hard enough to take an excellent poli&s;h. Tables of great beauty, and other ornamental furniture have been made of this wood, which is pur|cha&s;ed for this purpo&s;e by the Swedes and their northern neighbours.</P>
<P>Lapland too has its flowers, which during its &s;hort &s;ummer flouri&s;h in the vallies. This country in general is very mountainous and barren; the &s;ituations on its Lakes, however, and in the inter&s;tices of its Hills are picture&s;que and beautiful. But there are exten&s;ive for|e&s;ts dark and di&s;mal, long and dreary plains, covered with mo&s;s, and &s;wampy; the pro&s;pect of which cannot but
<PB N="80" REF="101">make the Inhabitant of mo&s;t other countries, truly thank|ful for comforts which the Laplander cannot po&s;&s;ibly enjoy.</P>
<P>Yet even the native of Lapland does not want his Enjoyments.</P>

<P>IT has not been my intention, as it certainly was beyond my ability, to give you a complete Hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Lapland. To do this a long re&s;idence in the country would be required; it would be nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e your&s;elf to the bitter winter bla&s;ts of this incle|ment region, to climb mountains deemed inacce&s;&s;ible to the feet of man, to live in the dark and dirty Huts of the native inhabitants, and to &s;eed upon &s;lender chee&s;e, or the powdered bark of &s;ome neighbouring tree. Now, you know me too well, to imagine that I would be thus liberal of my labours for the benefit of the world. Fatigue and Hunger are but mi&s;erable companions. Yet I will not &s;ay, how far curio&s;ity and the Love of Novelty would carry me, to become better acquainted with this Polar Clime and country. You mu&s;t, however, content your&s;elf with &s;uch ob&s;ervations as I have been able to give you, and that you may not &s;ay I have carried you over &s;o many Lakes and Mountains, through &s;o many fore&s;ts and plains, without
<PB N="82" REF="103">offering one agreeable repa&s;t to your mind, I feel my&s;elf inclined to give you Thomp&s;on's beautiful de&s;cription of the Scenes I have been de&s;cribing. There is another ad|vantage, I intend from this long quotation; and that is, if my reflections do not corroborate the &s;entiments of the Poet, the Poet will at lea&s;t ju&s;tify and illu&s;trate my reflec|tions.

<P>A People that live without exerci&s;ing the Arts of Agri|culture, even the &s;imple ones of ploughing, &s;owing and planting, affords a &s;ingular in&s;tance in the pre&s;ent Hi&s;tory of the World. Such a people are the Natives of Lapland. Ignorant of all the improvements of Life, un|knowing in the &s;everal embelli&s;hments of &s;ociety, they live, in the interior parts of Lapland, as much as po&s;&s;ible in a &s;tate of Nature.</P>
<P>Yet Providence, who always finds a &s;ub&s;titute where full enjoyment is denied, darts a ray of contentment beneath the ra&s;ter of the Laplander. Happy would it be for more poli&s;hed &s;ociety, if, in the mid&s;t of their entertainments, they could meet with the &s;ame con&s;olation! If the native of Lap|land
<PB N="86" REF="107">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not his flocks and his herds, if he &s;ees not a|round him vallies &s;miling with corn, nor his rich pa&s;tures and fine meadows, of this at lea&s;t he is certain, that he has no occa&s;ion for them. His Rein-deer is his ALL. Of all tame animals this is at once the mo&s;t &s;erviceable and provi|ded for with the lea&s;t trouble and inconvenience. I have had occa&s;ion to remark that their u&s;ual food is mo&s;s when they are unable to procure gra&s;s upon the Mountains.</P>
<P>I have before mentioned both the Rein-deer and the Sledge; but as I have an opportunity of &s;ending you a drawing of the latter, which has been purcha&s;ed by Sir H. G. L. for the purpo&s;e of &s;ending home as a curio&s;ity, I &s;hall add a more particular account of it.</P>
<P>The Sledge is &s;haped like a &s;mall boat, with a back-board for the per&s;on to lean again&s;t, who &s;its laced fa&s;t in, and well &s;ecured from the cold. It is peaked before, to which part the leather thong is fixed which yokes the rein-deer to the carri|age. There is a cloth girt around the body of the animal which is fa&s;tened on the back. The bit is a piece of &s;mall leather tacked to the reins of the bridle over the deer's head and neck, and from the brea&s;t a leather &s;trap pa&s;&s;ing under the belly is fa&s;tened to the fore-part of the Sledge which &s;erves in&s;tead of Shafts.</P>

<P>IT may be expected while I am at this place that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of the Inhabitants of the neigh|bouring Province of Swedi&s;h Finland. Tornao, as I have informed you, &s;tands at the very head of the Gulf of Bothnia, the ea&s;tern &s;hore of which is inhabited by the Finlanders, &s;ubjects of the King of Sweden. The other divi&s;ion of Finland lies further to the ea&s;t and owes alle|giance to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Finlanders which fell under our ob&s;ervation at, and near, Tornao, appear to be more uncouth in their figures, le&s;s civilized in their manners, and le&s;s intelli|gible in their language than their neighbours, the natives of Lapland. Like the&s;e, they are low in &s;tature, but &s;tout and active, and from that temperance in&s;eparable from their &s;ituation, live to very great ages. Their
<PB N="88" REF="110">country is of the &s;ame nature with Swedi&s;h Lapland, abounding in mountains, high and rugged, with rich and fertile vales, exten&s;ive and beautiful lakes. Many of the&s;e Lakes are navigable and might be made &s;till more &s;o at a very trifling expence. They communicate with the Gulf of Finland, and might very ea&s;ily be made the &s;eats of a good Trade. Ships are built here of a very large burthen; and Ship building in this place is a trade, which from the cheapne&s;s of materials might be very beneficial. Several French Agents during the late war, vi&s;ited Tornao to purcha&s;e Tar and other naval &s;tores. This in all probability would have turned to great advan|tage, if the &s;uddenne&s;s of the Peace had not put a &s;top to their tran&s;actions. From this circum&s;tance, I was credibly informed, they lo&s;t above a third part of their contract.</P>
<P>At Tornao there is a great annual Fair, frequented by the mountain Laplanders and Finlanders. At that &s;ea&s;on they re&s;ort thither in great companies, and barter furs and other commodities, the produce of their country, for hardware and other nece&s;&s;aries. This Fair continues a week, and is con&s;idered as a &s;ort of Finland Jubilee.
<PB N="89" REF="111">When they depart for their own mountains the arrange|ment of their Deer and loaded Pulchas or Sledges makes a very &s;ingular appearance. They do not travel in a mixed multitude and without order, but with much regularity and method. Precedency is always claimed, and allowed to the Senior. The others follow in rotation, which pre|&s;ents to the Eye a Proce&s;&s;ion of Deer and Sledges; the uncouth figures of men, and uten&s;ils of various kinds and &s;hapes, extending from &s;even to eight or nine miles in length.</P>
<P>The Furs, which are purcha&s;ed by the merchants of Tornao and the other Finland Towns, are made into male and female dre&s;&s;es, and &s;ent to Stockholm and other parts of Sweden.</P>
<P>There is no very e&s;&s;ential difference between this coun|try and tho&s;e of the neighbouring Latitudes. Their fi&s;h, fowl, and wild animals, are much the &s;ame, though prefer|ence has &s;ometimes been given to the Finland Fi&s;h. The Lakes, though of a pacific appearance, and pre&s;enting to
<PB N="90" REF="112">the Eye a tran&s;parent gla&s;&s;y &s;urface, are often turbulent and &s;tormy, &s;o that many in&s;tances have occurred of Ve&s;&s;els, even of large burthens, being &s;hip-wrecked.</P>
<P>The Religion of the Inhabitants of Finland, like tho&s;e of Lapland, is the Lutheran. But, alas! much is &s;till wanting to make them real Chri&s;tians. It would be a charitable action, nay I could go farther and &s;ay, that it is the duty of all the neighbouring Sovereigns to endeavour to inculcate the knowledge of true Chri&s;tianity into this, yet unenlightened, People. They are not &s;eparated by unnavigable Seas, or inacce&s;&s;ible mountains. Their un|der&s;tandings, though unimproved, are not mean: their tempers, though rough and uncivilized, are yet gentle enough to receive In&s;truction. It would be a glorious act to undertake to civilize this ferocious people. I would not here be under&s;tood to mean that this is a general de&s;crip|tion of all ranks of men in this di&s;trict of the Globe. I would confine the&s;e ob&s;ervations to the mountain Inhabi|tants, for the Inhabitants of their large Towns and other places of trade are not far behind the re&s;t of the world in the arts of Life, or in the cultivation of Religion.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t nothern point to which our Journey ex|tended was Tornao, from whence I have endeavour|ed to give you &s;ome account of the Inhabitants of this country. We left that place ye&s;terday, and though our accommodations were not of the mo&s;t agreeable nature, yet they were rendered tolerable by the civility and po|litene&s;s with which we were entertained. We had not travelled far, before we were informed, that we might have an opportunity of ob&s;erving a Laplander and his family who were feeding their herd of Rein-deer at no great di&s;|tance. We got out of the carriage, and walked about the di&s;tance of an Engli&s;h mile through a very thick wood where we found their family in a Tent or Hut. This con&s;i&s;ted of an old man, his wife, a young man and his wife with a very young child, probably about two months old. The infant was mo&s;t curiou&s;ly tru&s;&s;ed up in a cradle

This cradle, which is al&s;o &s;ome|times made of a hollow piece of timber like a &s;mall boat, the Lapland women when they travel, tie with the child in it, to their back. The child is not covered with bed clothes, but with a &s;oft and fine mo&s;s, over which they lay the tender &s;kin of a young Rein-deer. When they rock the child they fa&s;ten the cradle with a rope to the top of the Hut, and to&s;&s;ing it from one &s;ide to the other, lull the child a&s;leep. This Lapland family invited us to their tent and offered us their common, and only, fare which con&s;i&s;ts of deer's milk, and chee&s;e made of the &s;ame milk: occa&s;ionally they eat deer's fle&s;h, but have no kind of bread. We pre&s;ented them in return for their civilities with &s;ome wine which they &s;eemed to reli&s;h very much, but gave us to under&s;tand that Brandy would have been more acceptable.</P>
<P>The Laplanders are a &s;trong featured people, low in
<PB N="93" REF="115">&s;tature, but &s;o con&s;titutionally hard as to bear the &s;everity of the mo&s;t inclement &s;ea&s;on. The&s;e people are gene|rally born-in woods, and are frequently upon the &s;now, and wanderers from their birth to their life's end. Their Huts are formed of pieces of timber or rafters joined to|gether and covered with turf or the branches or bark of pine trees, &s;o that architecture here may be &s;aid to appear in its fir&s;t rudiments. Sometimes coar&s;e cloth makes a part of the covering of their tents. In &s;ome places, we were told, that their hou&s;es were built upon the trunks of trees, rai&s;ed above the &s;urface of the earth, or upon a &s;tone foundation, to prevent, in tho&s;e de&s;olate regions, their be|ing overwhelmed in the enormous drifts of &s;now, or de|voured by wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>In Summer, the Laplanders wear a clo&s;e garment which reaches to the middle of their legs girded clo&s;e about them with a belt. They have no linen, but their clothes are made in general of a coar&s;e wool without dying; their &s;hoes and caps, of the &s;kin of the Rein-deer with the hair outwards. In winter their clothes are of &s;kin with the
<PB N="94" REF="116">
hair inwards. The Women's apparel is not very different from that of the men.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the natives of Lapland are great cowards, and for that rea&s;on, the Swedes never employ them as Sol|diers. How unlike are the&s;e to the brave Highlanders of Scotland, who&s;e courage and intrepidity are as immov|able as their mountains!
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extreme cold has dimini&s;hed the Stature and congealed the faculties of the Laplanders; and the Arctic tribes, alone among the Sons of men, are ignorant of War, and uncon&s;cious of human blood: an happy Ignorance, if rea&s;on and Virtue were the Guardians of their Peace!

<P>WE ordered hor&s;es at four in the morning of the 28th. promi&s;ing our&s;elves &s;ome repa&s;t upon the road, but no refre&s;hment of any kind could be obtained till we arrived at Sunnana about four in the afternoon. The Poverty of the country is beyond any thing you can conceive. We &s;lept the &s;ame night at Burea the re&s;idence of dirt and famine, but quitted it as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;ible.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 29th. we breakfa&s;ted at Gumboda another &s;eat of mi&s;ery and want. Sir H. G. L.'s liberality of three Rix Dollars was here mo&s;t humanely applied and gratefully received by a poor indigent Boor, who had reared a family of &s;even children with hardly any other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than the Bark of the fir-tree. The &s;ight of &s;uch a &s;um, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it al&s;o, almo&s;t overcame
<PB N="97" REF="119">the poor man: his meagre, pen&s;ive and melancholy vi&s;age &s;oon brightened up and changed to joy and gladne&s;s. Thou&s;ands of his countrymen are in the &s;ame mi&s;erable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our Journey this day, after we had pa&s;&s;ed Gumboda, we received an invitation to dine with the Dean of B&ouml;gde. Our empty Stomachs could by no means refu&s;e &s;o well timed an invitation. We were re|ceived at the door by the Dean and his Lady. The Dean was a <HI>portly</HI> good looking elderly Gentleman, his Lady young and rather hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little formal ceremony we were u&s;hered in|to a very hand&s;ome apartment and &s;et down to what we were now quite &s;trangers to, <HI>a good Dinner.</HI> The Dean &s;peaking neither French nor Engli&s;h, acco&s;ted us in Latin.

<P>WE left Uma early on the morning of the 30th. but were detained at Dejecnaboda four hours for want of hor&s;es. Having cro&s;&s;ed many rivers and met with various impediments we did not arrive at the town of An&s;kt till near ten o'clock, where we intended to take a little refre&s;hment, but were obliged to content our&s;elves with <HI>very &s;hort commons.</HI> Here, al&s;o, we propo&s;ed &s;leep|ing; bnt, alas! the want of beds obliged us to travel for the re&s;t of the night.</P>
<P>The next day about noon we arrived at Veda with a &s;trong inclination to dine but were much di&s;appointed; famine and dirt having got a prior po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place. Our mortification was not a little increa&s;ed by being de|tained with &s;uch di&s;agreeable companions. We attempt|ed to cro&s;s a very large lake in a &s;mall boat, but were not
<PB N="100" REF="122">able from the inactivity or inexperience of the watermen who were afraid to take charge of the carriage, the wind blowing rather &s;trong. Ferry boats of a large burthen not being u&s;ed here, we were obliged to la&s;h two &s;mall boats together, by which means, though with no &s;mall difficulty, the carriage got &s;afe over. But our di&s;tre&s;&s;es did not cea&s;e here. Either through the wilful negligence of the boors or indolence of our ho&s;t, no hor&s;es could be pro|cured for &s;even hours; this indeed was a further and unex|pected intru&s;ion on the &s;mall remnant of patience we had left. But time, the &s;urmounter of all difficulties, at length relea&s;ed us, and brought us to the town of Herno&s;and, a beautiful well built Sea-port of much traffic. Here in|deed we fared &s;umtuou&s;ly, which produced (I fear for the fir&s;t time) a grateful thank&s;giving for <HI>what we were going to receive,</HI> &amp;c. Great and due commendations I mu&s;t be&s;tow on the Inn and our Ho&s;t in particular; every thing being neat, clean and good of its kind; the fir&s;t and only compliment I have hitherto had in my power to pay to a Swedi&s;h Publican.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;tay at Herno&s;and we pur&s;ued our Journey
<PB N="101" REF="123">towards Sunval where we arrived very late on the 2d. of July. Having &s;o many rivers to cro&s;s, and to travel over a mountainous country, we found were great impediments to expedition. A very great drought had prevailed for many weeks and we &s;uffered much inconvenience from the heat, but this evening a fine refre&s;hing rain &s;ea&s;onably relieved us. While we were &s;itting at Supper this even|ing we were agreeably entertained by &s;ome Shepherde&s;&s;es who played upon a kind of long trumpet made of the bark of the birch-tree, called in the Swedi&s;h language, Lur. This mu&s;ical In&s;trument is &s;ometimes four yards in length, has a &s;trong and &s;harp &s;ound, and in calm wea|ther can be heard at the di&s;tance of four or five miles. It is generally u&s;ed by the Shepherds in the woods and mountains, and employed by them with much &s;ucce&s;s in frightening away wild animals.</P>

<P>WE &s;et out early in the morning from Sunval and arrived the &s;ame evening at Ig&s;und where we had been &s;o ho&s;pitably entertained on our road to Tornao. The &s;ame Gentleman politely received us again and we &s;lept at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From the neighbourhood of this place were the two Lapland Girls taken, who are intended by Sir H. G. L. to be &s;ent to England, to fulfil a particular Engagement which he had made. As it is my intention afterwards to write you a full account of the&s;e females, I &s;hall pa&s;s over the &s;ubject at pre&s;ent. It will then be in my power to in|form you, how they performed their Journey and Voyage, how they were received and treated in England, and by what means they returned to their native country. Cer|tain it is, we had no difficulty in per&s;uading them to un|dertake
<PB N="103" REF="125">this Enterprize. They immediately accepted our offers and relied with the greate&s;t confidence on our pro|fe&s;&s;ions. As their minds were entirely uncorrupted by the Influence of foreign Intercour&s;e, as they had never travelled beyond their native mountains, as their return was at lea&s;t uncertain, it is very remarkable that they &s;hould &s;o ea&s;ily be prevailed upon to leave their friends and connexions, their Huts and their flocks, to undertake a dangerous, or at lea&s;t a tedious, Journey and Voyage, to vi&s;it a country of which they were ignorant, and re&s;ide among a People who&s;e manners and cu&s;toms they could not know. This probably may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be ac|counted for from the poverty of their own country. Yet &s;till we find in the Hi&s;tory of the human race, an Inclina|tion deeply rooted and &s;trong, towards our native home. There is &s;omething in the very word <HI>Home</HI> that fills us with inexpre&s;&s;ible affection. And if, according to the old Engli&s;h Maxim, it be <HI>ever &s;o homely,</HI> &s;till our wants and our wi&s;hes center there.</P>
<P>From the&s;e thoughts, my friend, you will conclude that my reflections at this moment are turned upon poor
<PB N="104" REF="126">OLD ENGLAND. They are indeed. And while I am viewing the&s;e bleak mountains and barren heaths, while I turn my Eyes upon a large extent of &s;andy de&s;erts or im|mea&s;urable woods, I cannot forbear ca&s;ting one Sigh to|wards a &s;nug retreat amid&s;t the Cleveland Hills, or the rich plains of the Bi&s;hopric of Durham.</P>
<P>Variety, however, renders all Situations agreeable. It will be &s;ome plea&s;ure to me to reflect that I have been in Lapland. Nor can any one de&s;cribe the comfort ari&s;ing from a good dinner and a bottle of hone&s;t Port &s;o well as he who has been in want of both. Such therefore are the con&s;olations that may be drawn from the variety of cir|cum&s;tances with which this world abounds. Such I &s;up|po&s;e were the expectations of the Lapland Girls when they agreed to accompany us to England.</P>
<P>As our time is not always at our own di&s;po&s;al, as we are &s;ometimes governed by winds and waves, &s;ometimes by po&s;t-boys and po&s;t-hor&s;es, you mu&s;t forgive me if my Let|ters do not always reach a rea&s;onable length. But believe

<P>THE Gentleman, who&s;e politene&s;s I have before re|marked, and at who&s;e hou&s;e we were &s;o ho&s;pitably entertained at Ig&s;und, propo&s;ed a fi&s;hing party on the morning of the fourth, on the Lake which is contiguous to his hou&s;e. His Son was &s;o obliging as to make one of our company, and do his utmo&s;t endeavours to entertain us. The Scheme, however, though well intended did not an&s;wer our expectations of plea&s;ure. Our Sport was not good; and therefore we exchanged our Entertainment on the water for a good dinner with our ho&s;pitable ho&s;t.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, with many Expre&s;&s;ions of thanks, we took our leave, and continued our Journey. We did not
<PB N="106" REF="128">halt till we came to Gefle, near one hundred miles di&s;tant from Ig&s;und. By di&s;appointments in procuring hor&s;es, and other impediments, we did not arrive there till the next morning at ten o'clock. After &s;o long and fatiguing a Journey, you may imagine, we were greatly in want of re&s;t. Therefore after taking &s;ome refre&s;hment we retired to bed and &s;lept till four in the afternoon; then dined, and &s;et forwards again a little before one in the morning.</P>
<P>We arrived at Faulund, a town in the province of Dalar|na, remarkable for a great copper mine, about nine o'clock at night; after having been confined to our carriage about twenty-eight hours without any &s;ort of Provi&s;ion what|ever and encountering our u&s;ual difficulties with re&s;pect to po&s;t-hor&s;es. The indolence and unconcern of the in|habitants and people of this place &s;urpa&s;s all conception. After a tedious and tire&s;ome Journey we naturally hoped and looked for &s;ome refre&s;hment, e&s;pecially in &s;o large a town, but our expectations were there defeated by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of additional grievances; &s;uch as, the want of food, a dirty hou&s;e, a drunken landlord, with many other cir|cum&s;tances equally comfortle&s;s and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="129">The town of Faulund is a large, and undoubtedly an opu|lent, town, on account of the circulation of money that mu&s;t naturally accrue from the carrying on &s;o immen&s;e and exten&s;ive a work. The&s;e copper works are undoubt|edly worth the traveller's in&s;pection. The impo&s;itions we met with in Faulund and the many delays upon the road from the wilful ob&s;tinacy and incivility of the people, urged us to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of making a formal complaint again&s;t them to the Burgo-ma&s;ter, as al&s;o to the Commandant. Sir H. G. L. &s;hewed a very proper and nece&s;&s;ary &s;pirit upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 7th. we arrived at Ave&s;tadt where there is a cu|rious copper work, and al&s;o the King's mint for coining copper money. The variety of purifications which that metal undergoes, as well as the various proce&s;&s;es before it comes to the mint, are well worth ob&s;ervation. The Governor of the mint paid us much attention, giving us an invitation to his hou&s;e, and treating us with &s;trong beer, a rare and uncommon beverage in that country! At this place we met the Spani&s;h and Dutch Amba&s;&s;adors on a tour through that country, with a very incon&s;iderable retinue.</P>

<P>WE arrived at Sahla between two and three o'clock on the morning of the 8th. of July. Near this town there is a con&s;iderable Silver mine. The Ore from which the metal is extracted re&s;embles the lead ore in England. Indeed many of the Engli&s;h lead mines yield a large quantity of Silver. As we are only birds of pa&s;|&s;age I had no opportunity of examining the manner of working the&s;e mines, neither can I give you any account of their produce. We were told that the mine we pa&s;&s;ed near this place is about two hundred and twenty &s;ix fathoms in depth.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t divi&s;ion of our Journey we did not travel over inho&s;pitable de&s;erts as before, neither through woods of immea&s;urable length, but through a fine rich cultivated country. In &s;hort the whole of the road from Fauland
<PB N="109" REF="131">to Up&s;ala was plea&s;ant and agreeable. The Tillage|ground appeared to be well wrought and clear of weeds, and to my &s;urprize was judiciou&s;ly trenched. The grain principally cultivated was Rye with a little Barley and &s;ome Wheat. The province of Agriculture is not alto|gether intru&s;ted to men as in England. Women here bear their part, and handle the plough, which on that ac|count is made very light and &s;mall.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we arrived once more at Up&s;ala and lo&s;t no time in viewing this ancient City and Univer&s;ity. This has been a place of Eminence from the earlie&s;t times of the Swedi&s;h Hi&s;tory. All the Kings of Sweden before the reformation were crowned and buried here, and here Queen Chri&s;tina re&s;igned her Crown in the year 1654. The celebrity of this place indeed in the times of Popery was owing, not &s;o much, perhaps, to its being the place of the re&s;idence of their Kings as of the Archbi&s;hop: for the Archbi&s;hops of Up&s;ala frequently made a greater figure than the Kings them&s;elves, and depo&s;ed them according to their own power and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="132">The City of Up&s;ala is &s;ituated upon the banks of the ri|ver Sala which falls into the Lake Encopen and is about thirty miles north we&s;t from Stockholm. There is an old Ca&s;tle here built and fortified after the Gothic manner which &s;tands high and commands the whole City. In for|mer days, this fortre&s;s was a place of great importance. There are many excellent paintings, medals and other curio&s;ities in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Univer&s;ity. Though Up&s;ala has been for many centuries a place of Eminence, yet the Univer&s;ity was not founded till 1476 when Pope Sixtus Quartus gave it all the privileges of the Univer&s;ity of Bononia. King Gu&s;tavus Adolphus was a great Patron of Learning throughout all his Dominions, and among&s;t others was very liberal to this place. He endowed Pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hips in mo&s;t Sciences with tolerable Salaries. The&s;e received an Augmentation from the Piety and Mu|nificence of his daughter the celebrated Chri&s;tina, who&s;e Protection of learned men and Encouragement to every branch of Science is de&s;ervedly extolled. This Prince&s;s was the Patrone&s;s of the learned Grotius whom &s;he called to Sweden, made him one of her coun&s;ellors and &s;ent him Amba&s;&s;ador to Lewis XIII. After he had di&s;charged the
<PB N="111" REF="133">Duties of his Employment he &s;et out from France to give an account of his Emba&s;&s;y to his royal Mi&s;tre&s;s. He met Queen Chri&s;tina at Stockholm, and after he had di&s;|cour&s;ed with her about the affairs he had been entru&s;ted with; he mo&s;t humbly begged of her to grant him his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. This, he had much difficulty to obtain, though this Prince&s;s gave him &s;everal marks of her great E&s;teem for him. She invited Carte&s;ius to Sweden, and was never more happy than in the Promotion of Piety and Learning. So long as Up&s;ala is remembered, Lin|naeus, whom I have once before mentioned, will not be forgotten. The King him&s;elf bore te&s;timony to his merits in a public Speech which he made &s;oon after the Death of that truly celebrated man.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to mention the venerable Cathedral at this place, in which lie entombed the ancient Kings of Sweden. This is a very magnificent Structure. In it is an excellent Organ, very beautifully ornamented; there is al&s;o a Clock very ju&s;tly mentioned by all Hi&s;torians of Up&s;ala, as a particular Curio&s;ity. It &s;hews not only the
<PB N="112" REF="134">day, hour and minute but al&s;o the remarkable motions of the heavenly bodies; and be&s;ides the&s;e, it tells every fe&s;ti|val, whether fixed or moveable, with many other &s;ingu|larly curious operations. Near the Altar the Remains of King Eric &s;tand inclo&s;ed in a Silver gilt box, where they have re&s;ted quietly and undi&s;turbed upwards of three hundred years. Tradition &s;ays he was &s;lain by the Danes, in a battle, upon a Sunday. The Enemy ap|proached Up&s;ala when the King was at his devotions in the Cathedral. He would not move till the Service was over, when he found the greate&s;t part of the City in the hands of the Enemy. He made an a&s;&s;ault, and though he &s;ell, his People were victorious.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY about &s;ix in the morning we re-entered the metropolis of Sweden, not a little rejoiced to find our&s;elves once more in a civilized country. Our fir&s;t care was to enjoy &s;ome of tho&s;e comforts we had been &s;o long deprived of. A refre&s;hing &s;leep, with <HI>clean</HI> &s;heets, were charms not to be re&s;i&s;ted. You will not therefore be &s;urprized that we indulged mo&s;t of that day in bed. In the afternoon, as it was Sunday, we attended divine Service in the King's Chapel, but could not expect much edification from our ignorance of the language. The Preacher &s;eemed very much animated in the delivery of his Sermon which continued almo&s;t an hour.</P>
<P>Our continuance at Stockholm lays us under great ob|ligations to Sir Thomas Wroughton, who has given orders to his Secretary to attend us upon &s;everal Excur&s;ions, particularly to Drottingholm Palace, which is well worth
<PB N="114" REF="136">the &s;tranger's notice. We pa&s;&s;ed the lake Meller in the Admiral's barge, which Sir Thomas had procured us for the occa&s;ion. This Palace is a &s;tately fabric, &s;ituated on the banks of the lake Meller; the Gardens, though exten&s;ive, did not impre&s;s us with the Idea of Royalty. They are very much neglected and laid out in the Dutch ta&s;te, which began to prevail in England in the time of King William. I mu&s;t own I was equally di&s;appointed in the Paintings. Though I pretend not to be any great connoi&s;&s;eur my&s;elf in this agreeable art, yet I could di&s;cern that they were more adapted to an attic &s;tory or lumber garret than to be u&s;ed as the ornamental decorations of a Royal Palace.</P>
<P>There is at this place a very curious collection of An|tiquities by the late Queen Dowager, particularly from the ruins of Herculaneum, with other Roman curio&s;ities. There is al&s;o a well collected Library, which does the royal Foundre&s;s much credit. This Palace is the favorite Summer re&s;idence of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; I was there|fore the more a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;o little attention paid, to render it neat and comfortable.</P>

<P>THE City of Stockholm, though at pre&s;ent the Metro|polis of the Kingdom of Sweden, was, not many centuries ago, a place of no great importance. Indeed we are told, that not much above three hundred years &s;ince, it was only an I&s;land with two or three cottages for Fi&s;h|ermen: but upon building a Ca&s;tle here to watch the motions of their Ru&s;&s;ian neighbours, and afterwards the Court making this a place of re&s;idence, it was rai&s;ed by de|grees to its pre&s;ent &s;tate of Pro&s;perity. This Ca&s;tle was burnt down about a century ago, but has been rebuilt in a more magnificent manner.</P>
<P>The City at pre&s;ent extends it&s;elf over &s;ix I&s;lands, which are connected together by bridges, with very ex|ten&s;ive Suburbs. The rocks, particularly towards the Sea, form a &s;ort of natural fortification. The Harbour
<PB N="116" REF="138">is very large and commodious, and will contain one thou&s;and &s;ail of Ships. But with all its conveniences as a harbour, the utility of its &s;ituation is dimini&s;hed from the difficulty of communication with the Sea. The lake Meller falls from it into the Baltic; but the pa&s;&s;age having &s;o many windings, and the circum&s;tance of there being no tides to a&s;&s;i&s;t the navigation of the Ships, renders it very difficult of acce&s;s. And if to this we add, that for four months at lea&s;t in every year they are frozen up, the&s;e circum&s;tances will be found great impediments to Com|merce. The Population of the capital of Sweden is reckoned at about one hundred thou&s;and Souls. The Ca&s;tle, which is u&s;ed as an ar&s;enal, as well as for the lodgings of the Officers, is a large building, and covered with copper, as &s;everal buildings are in Stockholm, from the many Copper-mines with which this country abounds.</P>
<P>I am unable to inform you of the exact produce of the copper and iron mines of Sweden; doubtle&s;s it mu&s;t be very large both to the proprietors and the King who receives about a fourth part. Yet notwith&s;tanding the large Income of the Crown, it is by no means equal to
<PB N="117" REF="139">the annual Expences of the Government.&mdash;The Market which is held at Stockholm is a circum&s;tance I mu&s;t not omit. The Butcher-meat is &s;old in &s;hambles on the &s;hore, while Vegetables and other marketable commodities are expo&s;ed to &s;ale in boats upon the water. This is at once a &s;ingular and plea&s;ing &s;ight. The moving Shops and va|riety of wares that are pa&s;&s;ing before your eyes, the bu&s;y mixed multitude which croud the &s;urface of the water, render this a very agreeable Scene. Something of this kind may be &s;een in the Thames upon the arrival of a large fleet in the Pool.</P>
<P>In Stockholm, as in other cold countries, the cu&s;tom of drinking Spirits prevails rather too much. Even Ladies, who by no means de&s;erve an improper Epithet, comply with this pernicious cu&s;tom. It is u&s;ual in this country, previous to dinner, for the company to a&s;&s;emble round the Side-board, and to regale them&s;elves with bread, but|ter, chee&s;e, or any thing of that nature, which preface is regularly followed in both &s;exes by a bumper of brandy. This cu&s;tom in the fair &s;ex reminds me of a &s;et of Rules
<PB N="118" REF="140">which I have &s;een for the regulation of a Ru&s;&s;ian A&s;&s;em|bly. It concludes with this remarkable Injunction&mdash;"N. B. Ladies are not to be drunk before ten o'clock."</P>
<P>I had occa&s;ion in a former letter to mention the di&s;til|leries of this kingdom. I cannot omit, though a circum|&s;tance I never before heard of, to inform you that Grain is not the only ingredient u&s;ed in Sweden for the di&s;tilling of Spirits. The low priced Brandies are made from Rye and <HI>Ants,</HI> a &s;pecies of In&s;ect very plentiful in this country. Upon enquiry I find, that "Ants &s;upply a Re&s;in, an Oil and an Acid, which have been deemed of con&s;iderable &s;er|vice in the art of Phy&s;ic."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Cyclopaedia. Word, Ant.</NOTE> The Ant u&s;ed upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions is a remarkably large black In&s;ect, commonly found in &s;mall round hills at the bottom of the fir-tree. It is le&s;s to be wondered that they &s;hould u&s;e the&s;e In&s;ects in their di&s;tilleries than that they &s;hould eat them and con&s;ider them as highly palatable and plea&s;ant. As I was walking with a young Gentleman in a wood near Gotten|burg, I ob&s;erved him &s;it down upon one of the&s;e living hills, which from the nature of its inhabitants I &s;hould ra|ther have avoided, and begin with &s;ome degree of keen|ne&s;s
<PB N="119" REF="141">to devour the&s;e In&s;ects, fir&s;t nipping off their heads and wings. The &s;lavour he declared was of the fine&s;t acid, rather re&s;embling that of a Lemon. My young friend in|treated me much to follow his example, but I could not overcome the antipathy which I felt to &s;uch a kind of food.</P>

<P>WHEN I left this place a month ago, I promi&s;ed, on my return, to lay before you &s;uch reflections as might happen to occur. I &s;hall therefore, like a man of my word, proceed to fulfil that promi&s;e and, as Dogberry &s;ays in the Play, "be&s;tow all my tediou&s;ne&s;s upon you."</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o large a tract of country during the la&s;t few weeks that you will naturally expect to hear &s;ome|thing of the Agriculture of Sweden. If the knowledge of Agriculture could be learned, or by any means attained by the Swedi&s;h Pea&s;ants; and the large and almo&s;t unlim|mited
<PB N="120" REF="142">tracts of ground be unincumbered of wood, which I have no doubt might be effected by time and indu&s;try, what a ble&s;&s;ed change might be wrought in the &s;ace of this country! The quality of the Soil appears in general no way inferior to ours in England; there is no rea&s;on therefore to &s;uppo&s;e but that the common method of Eng|li&s;h hu&s;bandry would equally promote and produce the like vegetation in Sweden.</P>
<P>One day when we were at dinner with Sir Thomas Wroughton, where agriculture and improvements were the topic of conver&s;ation, I could not help regretting that &s;o very large a tract of improvable ground, as I had lately pa&s;&s;ed over, &s;hould be &s;uffered to continue in &s;o rude and uncultivated a &s;tate, which by the hand of the indu&s;trious ploughman might become rich and fertile. It is too true replied a Swedi&s;h Gentleman pre&s;ent, but indolence and inactivity are the con&s;titutional failings of my countrymen, and may probably be a&s;cribed to the &s;everity of the cli|mate in which we live. We enjoy no mediocrity of &s;ea|&s;on; there is here no Spring or natural progre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="121" REF="143">warmth to introduce Summer, neither any Autumn, or gradual decrea&s;e of heat which might temper the habit again&s;t &s;o &s;udden a tran&s;ition to an inclement Winter. Each Sea&s;on from its inten&s;ene&s;s deprives the body of its proper and nece&s;&s;ary exertion. This produces ina|bility and habitual indolence. But though the produc|tions of this country are comparatively &s;o very in&s;ignifi|cant, yet are they more &s;peedy in their growth than perhaps any other part of the world. The Sun is eighteen hours and a half above the horizon for &s;ome weeks. This in a great mea&s;ure excludes night, and the heat of the Sun multiplies in proportion to its duration.</P>

<P>ARCHITECTURE, as well as other arts and &s;ciences, is at this day in Sweden at lea&s;t a century behind England. I mu&s;t not, however, omit ob&s;erving their method of building bridges over their broade&s;t and deep|e&s;t rivers, &s;everal of which we pa&s;&s;ed in our Excur&s;ion to the northern parts of this kingdom. They are undoubt|edly tremendous to the &s;tranger, who might imagine with &s;ome kind of dread that in&s;tead of mea&s;uring the breadth of the waters he is about to cro&s;s, he would fir&s;t be obli|ged to &s;athom the depth. They have no quay or wall on either &s;ide of the river on which to form a ba&s;is for &s;uch a building, it is therefore curiou&s;ly and well con&s;tructed in this manner. The thicke&s;t end of a thick piece of timber, the length and &s;hape of the ma&s;t of a large &s;hip, is fa&s;tened to the rock or mountain, the other end extended on the
<PB N="123" REF="145">water; a &s;econd timber of the &s;ame length is placed upon it, extending a fathom beyond it, and &s;o a third, and &s;ourth, to the middle of the &s;tream, where it meets with another &s;eries of timber-ma&s;ts from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and this without any cement, but merely re&s;ting upon each other; &s;o that in pa&s;&s;ing this, as it were, floating bridge, the ela&s;ticity is &s;ometimes &s;o great that about the middle it appears to &s;wing and the weight of either hor&s;e or car|riage dips it under the &s;urface of the water; a circu&s;tance &s;o tremendous and apparently dangerous, that a per&s;on unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch bridges may well imagine that it will ri&s;e no more. I have frequently &s;een travellers &s;top and water their hor&s;es on the middle of the bridge when they already touch the water from the &s;ub&s;iding of the platform. When freed from the weight of the carriage or pa&s;&s;enger it immediately ri&s;es to its proper height.</P>
<P>Were it not for the inten&s;e cold and drifted &s;now, a pa&s;&s;age over the rivers and lakes in winter would be as much more commodious for the traveller, as it is for the bu&s;ine&s;s and intercour&s;e of the inhabitants, who are &s;afely
<PB N="124" REF="146">conveyed over the ice in &s;ledges at the rate of fifteen Engli&s;h miles an hour.</P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erved in this country, though in &s;o high a northern latitude, e&s;pecially near towns, without even the benefit of manure, a rich natural herbage, from whence it is obvious that gra&s;s and tillage don't de|light both in the &s;ame climate, as there is often very little corn and that of a very inferior quality, where gra&s;s is both plentiful and luxuriant. As for the e&s;culent pro|ductions of Gardens, the&s;e they have neither ta&s;te nor in|du&s;try for, nor even curio&s;ity to promote; except indeed a kind of turnip, which is u&s;eful in their &s;oups, tobacco, and flax, which I have ob&s;erved in &s;mall quantities near huts and cottages. This, I think, is the utmo&s;t extent of their improvements in Agriculture.</P>

<P>IN the northern parts of Sweden fruit-trees &s;eldom or ever arrive at any degree of perfection, but the inex|hau&s;tible Fore&s;ts liberally compen&s;ate that defect. Even the mo&s;t barren mountains are &s;ingularly productive of trees, more particularly of the pine tree, which will &s;hoot from the &s;malle&s;t fi&s;&s;ures of the rocks and thrive much bet|ter than when carefully planted in a good &s;oil. The fir|tree thrives be&s;t in an <HI>independent</HI> &s;ituation (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) when the &s;eeds are &s;cattered abroad by the keen northern bla&s;t. This is the ea&s;ie&s;t method of propagating this tree, and the mo&s;t likely way to make it flouri&s;h. Collect the cones which contain the &s;eed, hang them up till perfectly dry, then commit the &s;eed which is &s;mall and light, to the &s;pontaneous di&s;tribution of the wind. There is a peculiar mo&s;s adherent to tho&s;e trees which in winter and the deepe&s;t &s;nows is a natural provender to the rein-deer: its quality is of the &s;ame nature with that
<PB N="126" REF="148">which grows upon the rocks on the barren &s;ummits of the mountains. For this rea&s;on when the &s;now is impenetra|bly frozen in the &s;evere winter, the boors are obliged to cut down &s;ome thou&s;ands of tho&s;e mo&s;s-cloathed trees for the &s;u&s;tenence of their herds.</P>

<P>IN the Citadel we were &s;hewn a &s;et of &s;mall Ordnance which belonged to King Charles XII. con&s;i&s;ting of four and twenty bra&s;s cannon mounted on their carriages. Very early in Life, before his Love of De&s;truction had occa&s;ioned &s;o many wild adventures, he u&s;ed to amu&s;e him&s;elf with firing at objects with this artillery. Proba|bly it would have been happier for him, as well as his country, if he had been always thus innocently employed. General Stenbork was the Prince's In&s;tructor in this Sci|ence. He had di&s;covered &s;everal Improvements in the art of Gunnery, and got this &s;et of bra&s;s cannon ca&s;t to illu&s;trate his principles to his royal Pupil, for whom he intended them as a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="149">There is an Anecdote related of this Prince which hap|pened at the time of his receiving this pre&s;ent. As it in &s;ome mea&s;ure had an influence on his future conduct to|wards the Ladies, I will tell it you, without, however, vouching for its authenticity. Very early the next morn|ing after he had received this pre&s;ent, before it was light, he waited privately upon the General. After much knock|ing, the door was opened by a Maid Servant and in a few moments the royal vi&s;itor was at the bed-&s;ide of the Ge|neral. After returning thanks for &s;o acceptable a pre&s;ent, and a long di&s;cour&s;e on the General's new plan of &s;ending a cannon ball to its greate&s;t di&s;tance, he took his leave, and was lighted down &s;tairs by the &s;ame maid &s;ervant that introduced him.</P>
<P>Though unaccu&s;tomed to acts of Gallantry, and always upon his guard again&s;t Exce&s;&s;es of this kind, yet for once Charles was &s;urprized by an amourous Inclination. Ob|&s;erving the attendant to be a young and hand&s;ome Girl he attempted to take &s;ome liberties with her which were not agreeable. Being a native of Dahlarna, and not
<PB N="128" REF="150">knowing, or pretending not to know the Prince, &s;he gave him an hearty box on the Ear. From this time, it is &s;aid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e took a di&s;like to the Fair-&s;ex: it is certain that he ne|ver afterwards &s;ought their &s;ociety. Even the beautiful Lady Koning&s;mark, who was reckoned the hand&s;ome&s;t woman of that time, could never make any impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart. When this Lady found her&s;elf &s;lighted by him, &s;he left the Kingdom, and became Mi&s;tre&s;s to the King of Poland.</P>
<P>From that time they never met but once; when that was, I think I will inform you, as I am now in the hu|mour for telling a Story. At the time King Charles XII. laid Siege to War&s;aw, he, with very few attendants, left the camp and rode privately to the City to &s;ee an Opera which was to be repre&s;ented that evening. The Subject probably had attracted him, and he did not always con&s;i|der the con&s;equences of a ra&s;h action; this was the re|pre&s;entation of a Battle between the Poli&s;h and Swedi&s;h Armies, the former of which upon <HI>this</HI> occa&s;ion was cer|tain of &s;ucce&s;s. At the end of the Mock-fight one of
<PB N="129" REF="151">the Swedi&s;h Officers exclaimed "We are undone now": the King replied, "Let the Poles obtain the Battle on the Stage but the Swedes in the Field." His voice was heard by Lady Koning&s;mark, who knew him at once, and with great anxiety di&s;patched a Page to apprize him of his danger. When the King received the Me&s;&s;age he looked towards the Lady, who immediately fainted. The King and his attendants took the hint which had been &s;o kindly given them, and returned to the Camp, before the Poles gained the lea&s;t intelligence that that augu&s;t Per&s;on had been pre&s;ent in the very heart of their City, as an humble Spectator of the defeat of him&s;elf and his Army.</P>

<P>WE left Stockholm on the evening of the 17th. and &s;lept at Soder-telge a &s;mall town two &s;tages from the metropolis. The next morning our road lay through a very fine &s;ertile country with large luxuriant fields of corn and other tillage. They were making hay in the meadows which &s;eemed to yield very plentiful crops. The roads in general are not unlike tho&s;e of Lapland, pa&s;&s;ing through very exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, over rocks and &s;teep hills. We were much delayed by the King's retinue which was then upon the road. All the po&s;t-hor&s;es, &amp;c. were engaged for their conveyance which prevented our arrival at Nordkoping till two in the morning.</P>
<P>This is one of the large&s;t and be&s;t built Towns in the Swedi&s;h dominions, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the banks of a beautiful lake. Notwith&s;tanding which it could not &s;o much
<PB N="131" REF="153">as afford either tolerable provi&s;ion or any comfortable accommodation. Happy were we to find beds, though bad ones; to the&s;e we retired like Philo&s;ophers with the old proverb in our mouths, "What cannot be cured" &amp;c. We took our departure &s;o early the next morning from the famous town of Nordkoping, that I lamented much that we were not able to examine it with more attention, as what I &s;aw in pa&s;&s;ing through appeared truly beautiful.</P>
<P>It &s;tands upon a large &s;pace of ground; a beautiful river runs through the middle of it; though not navigable, yet it has a commercial appearance. Upon enquiry I found it was not remarkable for trade or any particular manufactory. There are many &s;hops and neat well built hou&s;es; the &s;treets are &s;pacious and regular, but like the re&s;t of the Swedi&s;h towns it is ill-paved. The churches are lofty and magnificent.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing through the town, which took up &s;ome time, we entered a mo&s;t delightful country, and were
<PB N="132" REF="154">agreeably &s;urprized to find Pro&s;pects around us which brought to our remembrance Old England. We were treated with many noble views not inferior to tho&s;e of Richmond or Wind&s;or; large fields of luxuriant corn; hills richly cloathed with lofty trees, e&s;pecially oaks of an uncommon &s;ize. The beautiful and large lake Wetter, along the &s;ide of which we travelled, extends it&s;elf for &s;everal miles, with many plea&s;ant villages on its banks. There is in the center of this lake an I&s;land fourteen or fifteen miles long, which forms one complete pari&s;h and is a mo&s;t delightful place of re&s;idence.

<P>ON the 20th. we continued our Journey through a fine country, with delightful views, for near five Swedi&s;h miles; after which we entered woods, with a &s;wampy country on each &s;ide. Our delays have been &s;o frequent for want of hor&s;es that we have been obliged to travel ince&s;|&s;antly night and day, and to compleat our di&s;tre&s;&s;es fre|quently have not been able to procure any refre&s;hment. We were not &s;o provident as other travellers who are ac|quainted with the mi&s;eries of &s;uch a country as this, and carry their provi&s;ion along with them. The next day we pa&s;&s;ed through exten&s;ive woods which continued for ma|ny miles; the oaks in particular &s;eemed to be remarkably fine and of much antiquity. It is &s;omewhat extraordinary that they are not converted to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e, as every oak in Sweden is the property of the King who&s;e poverty frequently demands a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his Subjects.</P>
<P>As many travellers were at this time upon the road, the
<PB N="134" REF="156">provi&s;ions which, at the be&s;t, are but &s;canty, were all con|&s;umed before our arrival at the &s;everal &s;tages, &s;o that from &s;ix on friday morning the 21&s;t. we travelled till &s;aturday morning without food or &s;leep, except a very &s;mall por|tion (accidentally met with) of hard &s;alt Swedi&s;h beef. Delicious mor&s;el! and of great relief after &s;o long a fa&s;t. Our additional troubles were, as u&s;ual, want of hor&s;es as well as want of beds.</P>
<P>About eleven in the morning of Saturday the 2d. we arrived at Hel&s;ingborg a pretty town garri&s;oned by Swe|di&s;h Huzzars and &s;ituated on the &s;ide of the narrow Streight, known by the name of the Sound, on the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite El&s;inore. There is a &s;mall &s;ortified Ca&s;tle at this place, in which, as I was informed, there is a Dungeon an hundred and &s;eventy five feet deep. In this di&s;mal pri&s;on many of the Dani&s;h Nobility were confined and numbers of them &s;uffered to peri&s;h during the long and de&s;tructive Wars between tho&s;e neighbouring Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The Governor very politely waited upon us and gave
<PB N="135" REF="157">us an invitation to his hou&s;e, which time would not per|mit us to accept. After &s;ome &s;mall refre&s;hment we em|barked for Denmark in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, cro&s;&s;ed the Sound and landed at El&s;inore, a place of Trade and garri&s;oned.</P>
<P>There was much &s;uperfluous trouble and parade in ex|amining our pa&s;&s;port as well as baggage. The magnificent Ca&s;tle of Cronenburg &s;tands alone by the Sea, to guard the pa&s;&s;age. It will excite a &s;igh in the Brea&s;t of an Eng|li&s;hman when he views this Ca&s;tle, to reflect that here was confined a few years ago the Si&s;ter of his Sovereign, Ma|tilda, the unfortunate Queen of Denmark. It is now inha|bited by the Queen Dowager of Denmark who generally makes it the place of her Summer re&s;idence. The Pa&s;&s;age of the Sound is about three miles in a direct line between the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of Sweden and Denmark. All Ve&s;&s;els that &s;ail up and down the Baltic pay a toll at this place to the King of Denmark, and lower their top-&s;ails as they pa&s;s the Ca&s;tle of Cronenburg. This tribute is not &s;o much paid from any fear of the cannon of this fortre&s;s, as from immemorial cu&s;tom, and the general Law of Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="158">Having &s;ome Letters of recommendation to Mr. Fen|wick the Con&s;ul's Brother, we dined with him and immedi|ately after &s;et out for Copenhagen where we arrived at nine that night.

<P>THE road from El&s;inore for near five miles is exceed|ingly rough and ill-made, though the be&s;t materials are to be found within half a mile. When you come from the Sea coa&s;t, to, what is called, the King's road, it is remarkably broad and well made, but is in great want of that fine gravel which is a mo&s;t excellent covering to the Swedi&s;h roads. Upon your entering the great road, the Eye &s;eldom or never wants entertainment till you ar|rive at Copenhagen. The di&s;tant and nearer views are equally amu&s;ing. The country is rich, fertile, and lux|uriantly embelli&s;hed with villages, delightful gardens, tea|drinking places, &amp;c. Copenhagen is a hand&s;ome well built town, and notwith&s;tanding its di&s;advantageous &s;itua|tion, which is in a flat mar&s;hy country, yet is there a magnificent appearance in mo&s;t of the &s;tructures. The King's Palace e&s;pecially has a di&s;tingui&s;hing royalty which &s;trikes the &s;tranger's eye. Their Churches are neat
<PB N="138" REF="160">and not quite &s;o gaudily decorated as tho&s;e of the Swedes. The Women are fair, well made, and not unlike the Eng|li&s;h. Not far from Copenhagen is an I&s;land called Amak inhabited by a &s;ingular people, originally Dutch, but now living under the Dani&s;h Government. They were placed here by Elizabeth wi&s;e of Chri&s;tian II. and &s;i&s;ter of the Emperor Charles V. for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying her with vegetables and country fare. They wear one uniform of coar&s;e black cloth. The habits of the women are of the &s;ame colour, with caps of uncommon form and mo&s;t cu|riou&s;ly plaited. They pay a tax to the King for that pe|culiarity of dre&s;s, though it is of their own manufactory. They are a mo&s;t laborious, indu&s;trious and u&s;eful &s;et of people, indefatigable in the culture of Gardens, on which they principally depend for &s;upport. They appear, and wi&s;h to be thought, poor, but from their indu&s;try have become an independent people.</P>
<P>The manners and cu&s;toms of the Danes differ much from their neighbours, though &s;eparated only by the Sound. Denmark greatly exceeds Sweden in the cultivation of land,
<PB N="139" REF="161">their breed of hor&s;es (which are of the Hol&s;tein kind) and in many other advantages which they enjoy. Yet I am told by very good authority (the Con&s;ul of El&s;inore) that they are obliged to the Swedes for the greate&s;t part of their Cattle which they privately &s;muggle. This is very extra|ordinary and could hardly be credited from the appear|once of each country. The&s;e two near neighbours, like other contiguous &s;tates, cordially hate each other. They avoid all kind of intercour&s;e except when Intere&s;t interferes; <HI>that</HI> they pay as much attention to as any Hol|lander whatever. The Danes in general &s;eem of a phlegmatic con&s;titution and are very ob&s;tinate; a quality which we fully experienced in our po&s;ting through that country. The driver indeed is not &s;o much to be blamed as he has the &s;anction of the police to travel only at the rate of five miles an hour, but a wor&s;e privilege is that of &s;topping where and when he plea&s;es, &s;o that you are total|ly at the mercy of an ob&s;tinate drone, whom nothing can enliven but the touch of a dani&s;h ducat. The King is now di&s;qualified from holding the reins of Government, that power is for the mo&s;t part inve&s;ted in the young Prince and Council. The Prince of Denmark is much and
<PB N="140" REF="162">de&s;ervedly re&s;pected by his people. He conducts him&s;elf with great affability and judgement. His chief amu&s;e|ments, and tho&s;e in which he takes great plea&s;ure, are mi|litary Maneuvres. Neither is Literature without a &s;hare in the Attention of this amiable Character. No &s;mall part of his own private Fortune is de&s;tined to the promo|tion of learning and the Encouragement of learned men. This is a &s;ingular In&s;tance in the Hi&s;tory of Nations; and there is great rea&s;on to hope that the beautiful appearance of this ri&s;ing Sun will be &s;ucceeded by a full blaze of meridian Splendor.</P>
<P>The Soldiers in general are well cho&s;en men; the Officers exceedingly polite and well bred; their uni|forms re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, which is al&s;o the ca&s;e in their di&s;cipline.</P>

<P>THE King of Denmark has &s;even different Palaces, but few of them affording a very royal appearance. Co|penhagen is generally his place of winter re&s;idence, Fre|derick&s;burg of his &s;ummer. Since the Prince of Denmark has taken a &s;hare in the Government of this Kingdom, the Queen Dowager has not been allowed to appear at Court, except upon public days. It is &s;aid that when &s;he com|plained of being obliged to re&s;ide in the Ca&s;tle of Cronen|burg, her Grand&s;on replied, <HI>that there had been a time when &s;he did not think it an improper place of re&s;idence for his Mother.</HI></P>
<P>The City of Copenhagen is inter&s;ected by canals, &s;o that merchandize can be brought to the doors of the ware|hou&s;es. Commerce flouri&s;hes here exceedingly, and the Harbour, which is a good one, is generally well filled with Ships.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="164">The reformed religion of Luther is the religion of the State. They are very punctual in the performance of all religious duties, and attend public wor&s;hip with uncommon &s;trictne&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity. The Churches are kept open at particular times, and a Clergyman con&s;tantly in waiting to admini&s;ter the Sacrament to the &s;ick, to give comfort to the afflicted or perform any of the other duties of his function. The Clergy preach extempore and lead very exemplary Lives. Their whole dependence and &s;upport are in the hands of Government; of cour&s;e they often act with too much Servility and pay too much Submi&s;&s;ion to the court. They are held in high veneration by the com|mon people, over whom they &s;ometimes exerci&s;e too great an authority.</P>
<P>The Danes are very &s;trict in their Police, and act with great Severity again&s;t all tho&s;e who are guilty of frauds or mi&s;demeanors. Even the tongue, that unruly member, mu&s;t be guarded with great care, for they will not &s;uffer it to be u&s;ed licentiou&s;ly again&s;t the State, or in any political matter. Murder and Man&s;laughter are puni&s;hed in
<PB N="142" REF="165">Denmark by decapitation. Burglaries and petty thefts are not common; and you may walk the &s;treets at all hours of the night or day, without any mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>Agriculture would flouri&s;h better if it were better en|couraged. The oppre&s;&s;ion, however, which the farmer meets with from the owner of his lands entirely damps the Spirit of Improvement. They &s;ucceed extremely well in the breed of Hor&s;es, which are a contra&s;t to tho&s;e of Sweden, being from &s;ixteen to &s;eventeen hands high.</P>
<P>Literature flouri&s;hes at Copenhagen. There is a very good and well endowed Univer&s;ity, as well as an Academy of Sciences. I mu&s;t not omit to mention the Ob&s;ervatory or round Tower which was built by the order of Chri&s;|tian IV. who laid the fir&s;t &s;tone him&s;elf in 1637. It was fini&s;hed in 1642 and called Uraniburg, being built in&s;tead of that of the &s;ame name belonging to the celebrated A&s;tronomer Tycho Brahe in the I&s;le of Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, which was demoli&s;hed in his reign. The top of this Tower is flat, &s;urrounded with iron rails; the a&s;cent to it is fifteen foot
<PB N="143" REF="166">broad, and &s;o ea&s;y that it is not exaggeration to &s;ay that a coach may go up it. The Danes called it Stelleburg, from the u&s;e for which it was intended. There is a Mu&s;eum here containing many curio&s;ities both of nature and art.</P>
<P>The Government of Denmark is an hereditary Monar|chy. Its military E&s;tabli&s;hment about forty thou&s;and men. The Laws of this kingdom de&s;erve the admiration and imitation of all other States. They are contained in one volume of no great bulk, and are ea&s;ily under&s;tood by the very meane&s;t of the People. Ju&s;tice here is of a very &s;um|mary nature. A man's fortune can neither be dimini&s;hed nor his heart broken by a tedious Law-&s;uit. The deter|mination of no &s;uit, however great its importance, can be protracted beyond one year and a month. For this rea|&s;on the number of Lawyers in this country is but &s;mall. There are three Courts in Denmark: the City or Town court, from whence there lies an appeal to the county, and from that to the high court in Copenhagen where the King is &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide. There is one circum&s;tance however, attending this from which a free People cannot
<PB N="144" REF="167">but revolt, that is, the King, or his coun&s;ellors, can alter or explain any matter of di&s;pute, according to his, or their, plea&s;ure. Better therefore is it, to be &s;ubject to all the Prolixity, as well as Perplexity, of Law, than to have our Property and Per&s;ons dependent on the Nod of, perhaps, a capricious Tyrant, or intere&s;ted Judges.</P>
<P>The Nobility, though they re&s;igned their power to the Crown, &s;till exerci&s;e great authority over the Pea&s;antry, whom they keep in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage. It were to be wi&s;h|ed that this &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion might be entirely explo|ded in all the kingdoms of the continent as it is in our own. The Cultivators of land would then ri&s;e to a proper im|portance in the Scale of Subjects. Then would they feel their con&s;equence; Agriculture would be pur&s;ued with diligence and their toil would be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>AFTER leaving the Dani&s;h territories, which we did on the 28th. we landed at Hel&s;ingborg. Being now once more on Swedi&s;h ground and no longer &s;ubject to the tedious ob&s;tinacy of Dani&s;h po&s;t-boys, we u&s;ed our utmo&s;t exertions to reach Gottenburg, which we accom|pli&s;hed on Saturday the 29th. which compleated our tra|vels by land, after a Journey of three thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and eighty four miles, the greater part of which was over a barren unfrequented tract of country. No little rea&s;on had we to rejoice and be thankful, con&s;idering the many difficulties we had both experienced and &s;urmount|ed, when we found our&s;elves once more placed in a land of ho&s;pitality and comfort without having had a vi&s;itation of Sickne&s;s, or any other material cau&s;e of regret.</P>
<P>From Saturday the 29th. of July to the 12th. of Augu&s;t
<PB N="146" REF="169">we were wind bound at Gottenburg, during which time we experienced a repetition of civilities from our mo&s;t ho&s;pitable friends there. On the 12th. of Augu&s;t we re|embarked on board the Gottenburg-merchant Captain Fothergill, weighed anchor at nine in the morning and dropt down the river, but for want of a fair wind we were obliged to anchor above the ca&s;tle. The next day the wind coming favorable we got under way, put to Sea with a fine breeze and continued our cour&s;e with a fre&s;h gale. The weather being hazy we did not fall in with the Eng|li&s;h land till Thur&s;day morning about twelve, when we made Tynmouth ca&s;tle and got into Shields about &s;ix; &s;et off for Raven&s;worth where we arrived at ten that night.</P>
<P>Thus, my friend, I have brought you back to the point from whence we at fir&s;t &s;et out. I ought here to thank you for the patience with which you have attended to my tedious recital. If I have not added much to the &s;tock of Information, you mu&s;t not be di&s;appointed, as you may remember, I did not promi&s;e a great deal when we &s;et forward. With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, the Journey has
<PB N="147" REF="170">an&s;wered all my Expectations. It has opened a new Scene, and given a variety to pro&s;pects, which, before, I could enjoy only in Idea.</P>
<P>We have beheld human nature under her rude&s;t ap|pearances: we have &s;een her in a State very different from that which appears in cities or at courts, and have been enabled to draw conclu&s;ions from the varieties of Life. Plea&s;ure too, has not been wanting in our Excur&s;ion. Pro&s;pects plea&s;ing and romantic, the roaring cataract and high projecting cliff, the large and beautiful lakes, the mountains &s;tretching to the clouds, and the exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, like the Shifting Scenes in a Theatre, appeared in an agreeable Succe&s;&s;ion before our Eyes. And if we have &s;ometimes encountered dangers, and been deprived of comforts, the Le&s;&s;on we have been taught by this Excur&s;ion is, always to be contented with &s;uch Enjoy|ments as we actually po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>I Made you a promi&s;e, that before I concluded my cor|re&s;pondence, I would &s;end you &s;ome account of the two female Adventurers that accompanied us from Lap|land. It is now my Intention to give you that Intelligence. The motives which induced Sir H. G. L. to bring them &s;o very far from their native home are &s;ufficiently known. His Humanity and particular Attention to them when in England, his great care that they &s;hould meet with no ac|cident in their return, and the comparative opulence with which he &s;ent them back to their native mountains, do credit to that heart which planned the whole Journey. Many unfair and uncharitable cen&s;ures, I know, have been thrown upon the&s;e innocent Laplanders. The voice of bu&s;y rumour is not often &s;ilent upon &s;uch &s;ubjects. An ea&s;y con&s;titutional temper, joined to good Health and good
<PB N="149" REF="173">Spirits, is very apt to be mi&s;-interpreted by the moro&s;e and cen&s;orious. That this was the only foundation for any reflections upon the Lapland Girls, I dare venture to affirm. It is therefore cruel Malevolence to attempt to depreciate Innocence from mere Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>We fir&s;t met with our two female Travellers at Ig&s;und, a &s;mall Town, the Property of Clas Grill, Knight of the order of Va&s;a, and chief Director of the Swedi&s;h Ea&s;t In|dia Company. Their names are Sigree and Anea, and they are natives of Jockmo Lapmark. With re&s;pect to their per|&s;ons, they are low in &s;tature with broad features like the re&s;t of their country-women. We mu&s;t not, however, mea|&s;ure the Beauty of a Laplander by the &s;tandard of other countries. Cu&s;tom, in many re&s;pects an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of a more perfect model. And there is no doubt but a Laplander or a Negro would prefer the &s;ub&s;tantial Beau|ties of the one or the &s;able charms of the other, to the Alaba&s;ter Skin or glowing tints of the mo&s;t celebrated Engli&s;h Belle. That you may have &s;ome Idea, however, both of their Likene&s;s, Dre&s;s and Per&s;ons, a drawing taken in England will accompany this Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="174">We had no great difficulty in per&s;uading them to take this Journey. They &s;eemed &s;o &s;atisfied that our Intentions were good, and relied &s;o entirely upon the Promi&s;e of Sir H. G. L. that he would &s;end them &s;afely back again to their friends and country, that they made very little oppo|&s;ition to his propo&s;als. In all probability the Poverty of the&s;e females, joined to an enterprizing Spirit, occa&s;ioned their ea&s;y acquie&s;cence. They thought that if they return|ed at all, a circum&s;tance they &s;aw no room to doubt, they would not return in the &s;ame &s;tate of Indigence in which they then were.</P>
<P>It is more &s;urprizing that their Parents &s;hould con&s;ent to their undertaking this arduous Journey. They did &s;o, without any bribe or any other con&s;ideration than the faithful promi&s;e of our Baronet. <HI>They dropt,</HI> indeed, <HI>&s;ome natural Tears, but wiped them &s;oon.</HI> From Ig&s;und, they accompanied their Children a part of their Jour|ney, then took an affectionate leave and returned home. How extraordinary was the confidence of the&s;e old Peo|ple! Nothing but the Idea that their daughters would
<PB N="151" REF="175">return loaden with opulence, probably could have tempted them to have parted from them. Though even this is not apparent, as they were not &s;o mercenary as to expect to be bribed into their con&s;ent. Will it be allowed me to rea&s;on from hence, that the nearer we approach to a &s;tate of Nature, the le&s;s the human mind is &s;ubject to Su&s;pi|cions? There are Philo&s;ophers that would pur&s;ue this Idea through all its windings: but as I pretend not to &s;o exalted a Character, I &s;hall, after having &s;tarted the Game, &s;uffer you to pur&s;ue it, according to your own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When our Lapland female friends had determined to undertake the Journey, among other Que&s;tions, they de&s;ired to know whether there were any Churches in England. I know not what Idea they could have form|ed of this country. Probably they imagined that it was &s;omething like their own, and that the Inhabitants con|&s;i&s;ted, partly of Profe&s;&s;ors of the reformed Religion, and partly of Pagans or of tho&s;e who profe&s;s no Religion at all. How far &s;uch an Idea would have been con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="152" REF="176">
with Truth, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. The Lapland Girls, however, were not without their Sentiments of religion. And before they left their own country applied to their Mini&s;ter for a certificate of their fidelity to their own Church.</P>
<P>The female Laplanders, with three more as compa|nions, walked on foot with the five Rein-deer near &s;ix hundred miles by land before they reached Gottenburg, where we met them and embarked altogether for England.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e me if I digre&s;s for one moment on the Subject of the&s;e Rein-deer. The&s;e Animals &s;ince their arrival in England have bred, and are likely to become very prolific. Mon&s;ieur Buffon and other Na|turali&s;ts have affirmed that they will never thrive or breed in any country but Lapland. The Experiment which has been made upon this occa&s;ion will effectually confute this Idea. Few, indeed, have had the &s;ame ad|vantages
<PB N="153" REF="177">in making it as Sir Henry George Liddell, as few can have that convenience and ground for them to walk on that he has at E&s;lington-ca&s;tle, one of his coun|try-&s;eats, &s;ituated in the northern part of the county of Northumberland. Upon the E&s;tate there are &s;everal large Fir Plantations, be&s;ides very exten&s;ive Moors abounding in white Mo&s;s, a &s;ort of food they are par|ticularly fond of: notwith&s;tanding, they will eat good Gra&s;s or Fog. From their pre&s;ent appearance there &s;eems no doubt but that they will become very numer|ous, and amply repay Sir H. G. L. for his great Expence in bringing them to England.</P>
<P>The female Laplanders were received in this country as great curio&s;ities and vi&s;ited by all ranks of People. And probably they were as curious to &s;ee others, as others were to &s;ee them. I have before told you that they were lively and chearful; I may add al&s;o that they were graceful and unaffected. The natural habits and con&s;titutions of the&s;e two females were truly amiable: their tempers &s;teady and unvariable, their happy di&s;po|&s;ition
<PB N="154" REF="178">pictured in their faces. Be&s;ides, they were par|ticularly ea&s;y in their addre&s;s, e&s;pecially Sigree, &s;o much &s;o, that in&s;tead of their Lapland mountains you would have imagined their Education had been in the Drawing room. This ob&s;ervation has been frequently made by Lady L. who&s;e natural Ea&s;e and Politene&s;s give the greate&s;t weight to her Opinion.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome Satisfaction, too, to reflect that during their &s;tay in England they lo&s;t none of tho&s;e natural accom|pli&s;hments which they brought along with them. Though introduced to People of di&s;tinction they lo&s;t none of their Mode&s;ty and Humility; though di&s;tant from their native country, and po&s;&s;ibly uncertain of their return, they lo&s;t none of their Liveline&s;s.</P>
<P>The Time came when they were to return; and the &s;ame friend who brought them into this country was particularly anxious that they &s;hould meet with no acci|dents in returning. They re-embarked in the &s;ame Ship that brought them, and we know for certain that they
<PB N="155" REF="179">&s;afely reached their native land after an ab&s;ence of &s;e|veral months. When our Lapland female Adventurers returned to their native country, we were informed by a corre&s;pondent from Sweden, that, their appearance in that Kingdom and in the City of Stockholm, was not le&s;s attended to as a novelty, than when they fir&s;t arrived in England. The Curio&s;ity of the Swedes was great, and their Interogatories many, concerning the reception they met with in England. To all the&s;e Que&s;tions they were able to give the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. Their ap|parel, and their little &s;tock of riches, te&s;tified the manner in which they had been treated: and they them&s;elves ex|pre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t grateful regard to the ho&s;pitality of Raven&s;worth-ca&s;tle, and the liberal favors they had re|ceived from its worthy owners.</P>
<P>When the King of Sweden's Brother heard of their ar|rival at Stockholm, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee them. They were accordingly u&s;hered into his pre&s;ence. The royal Swede was very particular in enquiring into all the circum&s;tances of their Journey. Their replies, all tended
<PB N="156" REF="180">to the Honor of the Engli&s;h nation, and they did not &s;cruple to inform him of their reluctance to leave that land of Ho&s;pitality,</P>
<P>Though the untutored minds of the&s;e Girls could never have been taught any of the &s;ublime Virtues, or impre&s;&s;ed with a proper Sen&s;e of Gratitude, yet from all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances it is evident that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in all its purity. They lo&s;t no opportunity in England, or in Sweden, and, I doubt not, afterwards in Lapland, of gratefully acknowledging the favors of their munificent Benefactor. When they returned to their native huts, they &s;ound them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Wealth, much &s;uperior to their neighbours: for opulence entirely depends upon compari&s;on. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Engli&s;h Coin fifty pounds, which in the currency of Sweden is equal to one thou&s;and two hundred and fifty Dollars &s;ilver mint, or three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty, copper mint. Nor was this all their riches; they had be&s;ides, many bountiful Pre|&s;ents of Trinkets both valuable and numerous.&mdash;It is one part of the ceremony at a Lapland Wedding to adorn the
<PB N="157" REF="181">Bride with a crown ornamented with a variety of gaudy trinkets, and on the&s;e Occa&s;ions the mo&s;t &s;plendid baubles are generally borrowed of their more opulent Neighbours. In this kind of Gayety and Splendor, our Travellers ex|cel their whole country; and their Engli&s;h trinkets are obtained at a great price to deck out and ornament their Marriage &s;olemnities.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you a general Account of our Tra|vels, and of our Lapland fellow Travellers. You will have much to pardon, and I am afraid not much to com|mend. To make up for my deficiences upon this occa&s;ion, I will conclude the whole with making you this faithful Promi&s;e, that the <HI>next</HI> time I go to Lapland I will endea|vour to furni&s;h you with a better account.</P>
