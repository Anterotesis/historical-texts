<P>Matrimony!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look'e, Landlord, I don't think that twenty years of di&s;&s;ipation will qualify me the better for a hu&s;band: I look on marriage as a &s;ort of partner&s;hip, in which I mean to en|gage whil&s;t I can bring youth, good &s;pirits, and a good con&s;titution, as my &s;hare of the &s;tock in trade: but when a pretty girl finds her&s;elf in|trapp'd into a connection with a bankrupt trader, can he be angry with her for taking mea&s;ures to di&s;&s;olve the partner&s;hip?"</P>
