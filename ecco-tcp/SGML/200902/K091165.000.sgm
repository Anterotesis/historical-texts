<P>I NATURALLY begin this little hi&s;tory with the account of <HI>Tre Eden Owain,</HI> the place where I fir&s;t made my entrance into this bu&s;y world. The principal hou&s;e in this town&s;hip, <HI>Downing,</HI> was built in the year 1627.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOWNING.</NOTE> It certainly had no preten&s;ions to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> name of <HI>Downing,</HI> which doubtle&s;sly was a corruption from <HI>Eden Owain,</HI> the <HI>Tre</HI> or town&s;hip in which it &s;tands. The founder was <HI>John Pennant,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Nicholas Pennant,</HI> a younger &s;on of <HI>Hugh Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Bychton.</HI> He married the heire&s;s of the place, and built a hou&s;e, which was much too large for the e&s;tate. The &s;tones were brought from <HI>Nant-y-bi,</HI> a dingle oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e. There is a tradition, that the &s;tones were rolled along a platform from the top of the quarry, rai&s;ed on an
<PB N="2" REF="10">
inclined plane till they reached the building, and there were ele|vated as the work increa&s;ed in height, till the whole was fini&s;hed. The hou&s;e is in form of a <HI>Roman</HI> H, a mode of architecture very common in <HI>Wales</HI> at that period. On the front is the pious motto frequent on the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> hou&s;es, <HI>Heb Dduw heb ddim, a duw a dig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> which &s;ignifies,
<Q>Without God there is nothing, with God enough.</Q>
There were only four generations of this branch; <HI>Thomas,</HI> the la&s;t, died in 1724, and was buried in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church, on <HI>June</HI> 6th of the &s;ame year. He bequeathed his e&s;tate to my father, who made the hou&s;e his re&s;idence; his own father being living, and the hou&s;e much better than our paternal.</P>

<Q>Ah, you rogue! I remember you when you had not a &s;hirt to your back.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT MODE OF NURSING.</NOTE>I WAS, according to antient cu&s;tom, put out to nur&s;e at a neigh|boring farm-hou&s;e, called <HI>Pentre,</HI> covered with thatch, and which at pre&s;ent would be deemed a cottage. My nur&s;e's maiden name was <HI>Pennant;</HI> and from the time of this great event &s;he re|&s;umed it, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had long u&s;ed that of her hu&s;band, <HI>John Pierce,</HI> a freeholder of above a hundred a year. He and &s;he were fond of this charge, which was ever e&s;teemed a peculiar favor and honor. The affection and connection is &s;till retained in many parts of <HI>Ireland;</HI> but what is unfortunate in more civilized <HI>Wales,</HI> both &s;eem at pre&s;ent almo&s;t extingui&s;hed.</P>

The fidelity of <HI>Robin ap Inko,</HI> fo&s;ter-brother to <HI>Jevan ap Vychan,</HI> of the hou&s;e of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. was a mo&s;t noted one. In a fatal feud between <HI>Jevan</HI> and his brother-in-law <HI>Rys ap Howel,</HI> the latter, expecting a fray, provided a butcher to murder <HI>Jevan</HI> in the confu&s;ion of the battle, and to him he gave orders in the&s;e terms. The butcher not being acquainted with <HI>Jevan, Ap Rys</HI> &s;aid,
<Q>Thou &s;halt &s;oone di&s;cerne him from the re&s;t by his &s;tature, and he will make way before him. There is a fo&s;ter-brother of his, one <HI>Robin ap Inko,</HI> a little fellow, that u&s;eth to match him behind: take heed of him, for be the encountre never &s;oe hot, his eye is ever on his fo&s;ter-brother;</Q>
&mdash;and &s;o it happened. <HI>Robin</HI> &s;u&s;pected the treachery, and &s;eeing the butcher watching his opportunity, came behind him and knocked him on the head in the moment in which he had come behind <HI>Jevan,</HI> and had aimed one at that of his beloved fo&s;ter-brother. The patrimony of his faithful follower was in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llanderfel;</HI> and to this day retains the name of <HI>Tyddin Inko.</HI></P>
<P>IN tho&s;e days there was great competition for the honor of fo&s;tering the children of great men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORRID MURDEN.</NOTE> The par&s;on of <HI>Llanvrothen</HI> near <HI>Traeth-mawr,</HI> had taken a child of <HI>Jevan ap Robert</HI> to nur&s;e. This &s;o grieved the wife of <HI>Rys</HI> (her hu&s;band having more land in the pari&s;h than <HI>Jevan</HI> had) that &s;he determined to have the poor par&s;on put to death. A woman was &s;ent to his hou&s;e, who was kindly taken in. At midnight &s;he &s;et up hideous cries, pre|tending that the par&s;on had attempted to ravi&s;h her. This only was a pretence for revenge: the woman had, as the hi&s;torian &s;ays,
<PB N="4" REF="12">
to her brethren three notable rogues

<P>WHEN I came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Downing,</HI> by the death of my excellent father <HI>David Pennant,</HI> the hou&s;e had partly tran&s;ome, partly &s;a&s;hed windows. By con&s;ulting a drawing of it in that &s;tate, may be known the changes made by my&s;elf. With the e&s;tate, I luckily found a rich mine of lead ore, which enabled me to make the great improvements I did. The grounds were much hurt by a vile road running in front and on one &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and through the middle of the deme&s;ne, to the hamlet called <HI>Gwibnant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GWIBNANT.</NOTE> or <HI>the meandring glen.</HI> The hou&s;e was planted up almo&s;t to the door, which gave it a very melancholy gloom. But I &s;oon laid open the natural beauties of the place, and by the friendly exchange Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn</HI> made with me, enlarged the fine &s;cenery of the broken grounds, the woods, and the com|mand of water. The walks in the near grounds, the fields, and the deep and dark&s;ome dingles, are at left three miles in extent, and the dingle not ill united with the open grounds, by a &s;ubter|raneous pa&s;&s;age under the turnpike road. I am not a little flattered by the admiration of tho&s;e who vi&s;it the place. Mr. <HI>Boydel</HI> has publi&s;hed a fine engraving of the hou&s;e among his <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> feats. I have, as a head-piece to p. 1. of this Work, given it in the prettie&s;t repre&s;entation.</P>

<Q>for he was a prince that loved peace and good order, and that feared God.</Q>
I am &s;orry to deprive our ance&s;tor of his title of earl: the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> had none &s;uch among them. Our great

<P>THE families de&s;cended from this chieftain were exceedingly numerous, but tho&s;e &s;till exi&s;ting in the male line are only the following: <HI>Thomas Trevor Hampden</HI> vi&s;count <HI>Hampden, Richard Pennant</HI> Lord <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,</HI> and the <HI>Mo&s;tyns</HI> of <HI>Bryngwyn,</HI> of <HI>Segrwyd,</HI> branches of his family, and Sir <HI>Pyers Mo&s;tyn, Eytons</HI> of <HI>Eyton, Wynnes</HI> of <HI>Gwerninvawr, Jones's,</HI> of <HI>Llwynon,</HI> and <HI>Jeffries's,</HI> of <HI>Acton,</HI> exi&s;ting in my friend the Rev.

<P>ADJACENT to this wood is my paternal &s;eat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BYCHTON.</NOTE> I may &s;ay the primaeval &s;eat of our family. The date, on a piece of wood over an added window, is 1572.

There was a much more antient date on a beam in the barn, which was inadver|tently de&s;troyed when I new built it.

the act which graced our country with its fair &s;ynonymi&s;t.</P>
<P>I HOPE the reader will not think me too warm, for thus vin|dicating my clame to <HI>birth,</HI> in common with my worthy brother-in-law. I am jealous that the honors which I po&s;&s;e&s;s by means of our marriage with his aunt <HI>Shonet,</HI> ten a&s;cents higher, &s;hould receive any abatement: and I tru&s;t that the lady concerned will, as a <HI>Wel&s;h-woman,</HI> even applaud my warmth on &s;o very intere&s;t|ing an occa&s;ion!</P>
<P>OUR hou&s;e has always been the <HI>Pen-cenedl,</HI> or chief of the name.

<P>THE fir&s;t who branched from us was the ho&s;pitable, the u&s;eful, the valiant <HI>Thomas Pennant,</HI> abbot of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk,</HI> &s;on of <HI>David Pennant ap Tudor,</HI> before mentioned. He flouri&s;hed in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and is highly celebrated by <HI>Guttun Owain,</HI> a bard of the year 1480, who records the ho&s;pitality of the abbot, in a poem printed in the collection of Mr. <HI>Rh&ycirc;s Jones.</HI> The poet is &s;o liberal of his prai&s;e as to &s;ay, <HI>That he gave twice the trea&s;ure of a king in wine.</HI></P>

A good granary on the other &s;ide, a malt-hou&s;e, and a hou&s;e of bricks: which la&s;t was probably a material in building of recent introduction in our country.</P>
<P><HI>Guttun Owain</HI> and <HI>Tudor Aled,</HI> another noted bard, &s;peak not only of his works of utility; of the water and of the wind-mills he erected; of his having enlarged and beautified the abbey, but al&s;o compliment him on his prowe&s;s in battle. Neither is <HI>Guttun</HI> &s;ilent on a &s;ubject, plea&s;ing to every <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> ear, the pedegree of his patron, whom he derives from <HI>Edwyn,</HI> and from <HI>Rh&ycirc;s Sais,</HI> a direct de&s;cendant from <HI>Tudor Trevor.</HI></P>
<P>IT is probable that our abbot di&s;covered that celibacy did not &s;uit his con&s;titution. He quitted his profe&s;&s;ion, and became (in the law term) a monk <HI>deraigne,</HI> and married into the great hou&s;e of <HI>Peurbyn,</HI> a lady of the name of <HI>Angharad.</HI> He became the father of four children. Of them, <HI>Edward</HI> the elde&s;t &s;ucceeded to the fortunes which he &s;eems to have &s;ecured in the pari&s;h of <HI>Holywell. Thomas,</HI> the &s;econd &s;on, became vicar of <HI>Holywell.</HI> And <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the third, in due time abbot of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk;</HI> he was the la&s;t, and became founder of a family, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention. More al&s;o will be &s;aid of the line of <HI>Edward,</HI> who may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t of the hou&s;e of <HI>Bagilt.</HI></P>
<P>WE did not a&s;&s;ume the name of <HI>Pennant,</HI> till the time of <HI>David Pennant ap Tudor,</HI> fifteenth in de&s;cent from <HI>Tudor Trevor;</HI> it is a

I &s;hould blu&s;h if a <HI>Pennant</HI> &s;hould be found, who through lack of public &s;pirit, &s;loth, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;e, could decline that great con&s;titutional office! The fir&s;t &s;heriff of our hou&s;e was <HI>Pyers Pennant,</HI> who di&s;charged that tru&s;t in 1612. He had the lot of marrying the daughter of a family not famed for placidity, or the milder virtues. <HI>Vald&egrave; valde, irritabile genus!</HI> 'And from them, <HI>Tom</HI> (a mo&s;t worthy aunt of mine u&s;ed often to tell me) we got our pa&s;&s;ion;'&mdash;and frequently added the wi&s;e <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> caution, <HI>Beware of a Breed!</HI></P>
<P>THE fruits of this marriage appeared very &s;oon. <HI>Thomas,</HI> the elde&s;t &s;on, in a <HI>furor brevis,</HI> killed his miller: was indicted for the man&s;laughter, tried, and convicted; but received his pardon, dated in the fir&s;t of <HI>Charles</HI> I. or the year 1625. This grace pre&s;erved him from the ignominious part of the &s;entence, and the more important advantage of pre&s;erving his per&s;onality, which would otherwi&s;e have been forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="49">THIS is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that the offence did admit of every palliation; but a &s;tronger proof than that may be drawn from the following honor having been conferred on him, when we find that in eight years afterwards, in 1633, he was intru&s;ted with the care of the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> by having the office of high &s;heriff committed to his charge. He died the next year; <HI>cujus animae propitietur</HI> DEUS!

<Q>to be in a late communication, where a gentleman &s;poke of a hideous thing that happened in <HI>High Holborn;</HI> how one <HI>John Pennant,</HI> a young man of 21, being di&s;&s;ected after his death, there was a kind of &s;erpent, with divers tails, found in the left ventricle of his heart, which you know is the mo&s;t defended part, being thrice thicker than the right, and is the cell which holds the pure&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious liquor, the arterial blood and the vital &s;pirits. The &s;erpent was it &s;eems three years ingen|dring, for &s;o long time he found him&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed in the brea&s;t; and it was ob&s;erved that his eye, in the interim, grew more &s;harp and fiery, like the eye of a cock, which is next the &s;erpent's eye in redne&s;s: &s;o that the &s;ymptom of his in|ward di&s;ea&s;e might have been told by certain exterior rays and &s;ignatures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>GOD pre&s;erve us from public calamities! for &s;erpentine mon&s;ters have been often ill favored pre&s;ages.

<Q>to the renowned peere of this king|dom, <HI>Edward</HI> earle of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI></Q>
the book it&s;elf to Sir <HI>Theodore Maiherne,</HI> knight. In that he lays before him the wonderful ca&s;e. He tells us that he was &s;ent on <HI>October</HI> 7th, 1637, by Lady
<PB N="48" REF="60">
<HI>Herris,</HI> wife to Sir <HI>Francis Herris,</HI> knight, to di&s;&s;ect her nephew <HI>John Pennant,</HI> who had decea&s;ed the night before, to know the cau&s;e of his death. The doctor brought with him Ma&s;ter <HI>Jacob Heyden,</HI> &s;urgeon, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the enquiry. Mr. <HI>Heydon</HI> made in|ci&s;ion into the left ventricle of the heart, which was full of blood. On thorough examination, the mon&s;ter was di&s;covered, the head of which was &s;o like to that of a &s;erpent, that Lady <HI>Herris</HI> &s;hivered to &s;ee it. To judge by the prints, all the upper part of it was cylindrical; towards the lower part bifurcated, and each fork divided into five long and &s;lender fibrillae. I leave to the reader the peru&s;al of the re&s;t of Dr <HI>May</HI>'s mo&s;t curious di&s;|qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>THIS is not the only in&s;tance of &s;imilar appearances in the heart: but we hear no more of &s;erpents; the name was changed to <HI>polypu&s;es,</HI> to which, for their numerous ramifications, they might bear the re&s;emblance. In our Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions are more than one paper on the &s;ubject. In Mr. <HI>Lowthorp</HI>'s Abridg. iii. p. 70, and tab. p. 120, is an account, and the figure of one found in the heart of a man at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and in Mr. <HI>Martyn</HI>'s Abridg. ix. p. 135, is the account of &s;everal di&s;covered in num|bers of &s;ailors who died immediately on their return from the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> This paper was written by the celebrated Dr. <HI>Huxbam;</HI> he quotes <HI>Malpighius, Bartholinus, Tulpius,</HI> and <HI>Pechlin,</HI> as giving inconte&s;tible in&s;tances of the exi&s;tence of polypi in the heart, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. This opinion is now exploded. The only uncommon circum&s;tance (my ingenious friend Dr. <HI>Haygarth</HI> a&s;&s;ures me) is, that the left ventricle of the heart, and probably the <HI>aorta,</HI> which after death are u&s;ually empty, were
<PB N="49" REF="61">
in the&s;e ca&s;es full of blood. The <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> upon coagula|tion, had taken the form of the arteries in which it was con|tained.</P>
<P>I BREAK a little into chronology,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARBAROUS EVENTS.</NOTE> to conclude with an event relative to another of my hou&s;e; of little moment indeed, but merely to give a picture of the barbarous days, even of the be|ginning of the la&s;t century, which I collected from the journal kept by <HI>Peter Roberts,</HI> of <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> before mentioned. He re|cords, that on <HI>July</HI> 22d, 1615, <HI>Hugh Pennant,</HI> brother to <HI>Pyers Pennant,</HI> <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Bychton,</HI> died of a broken head given him at <HI>Denbigh,</HI> by <HI>Pyers Hughes:</HI> That in the year 1626, <HI>Rowland Evan,</HI> a vicar of <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> was killed at an ale-hou&s;e in <HI>Llandrillo Eiderneon:</HI> That on <HI>October</HI> 3d, 1628, Mr. <HI>Richard Thelwal</HI> was &s;lain at his own hou&s;e at <HI>Ruthen:</HI> And that, in 1634, one <HI>Foulkes,</HI> of <HI>Cilowen,</HI> killed his wife, and cut his own throat.</P>
<P>THE mention of ale hou&s;e tempts me to &s;peak of a hou&s;e of mine, by the &s;ea-&s;ide, in the town&s;hip of <HI>Bychton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLETTY GONEST.</NOTE> called <HI>Lletty Gone&s;t,</HI> or the <HI>hone&s;t hou&s;e.</HI> It had been formerly in the highe&s;t repute for its excellent ale, brewed by a good ale-wife yclep'd <HI>Jane,</HI> of <HI>Lletty,</HI> whom I well remember. She acquired both fame and wealth, both of which I may &s;ay &s;he bequeathed to her de&s;cendants; who to this day, by their own indu&s;try, continue to flouri&s;h on the effect of her's.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e was originally built by one <HI>Smith,</HI> from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> partly for the purpo&s;es of di&s;tilling, and partly for a warehou&s;e. I am told, that it occa&s;ionally had &s;erved for the place of con|finement for impre&s;&s;ed men, at the time in which the colliers
<PB N="50" REF="62">
had &s;uch great trade with <HI>Dublin.</HI> The &s;trong bars in the lower windows favor that notion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR HEAD.</NOTE>ABOVE the door is a very &s;ingular &s;culpture, cut in bas-relief, in &s;tone, and let into the wall. One part is a &s;trange chimerical figure of a mon&s;ter with four legs, and the head of an owl, fixing its claws in the &s;ide of a human head. The face is averted, and expre&s;&s;ing much agony. The eye-lids are drawn up, the eyes the &s;ame, the mouth half opened, and the teeth clo&s;ely fixed together. The face is young, but has a pair of whi&s;kers, and is far from being ill cut. It has the character of one of <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ions, article <HI>Pain.</HI> It evidently never was de&s;igned for this place, but &s;eems originally to have been one of tho&s;e fanciful <HI>gothic</HI> &s;culptures be|longing to &s;ome antient church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SMUGGLING.</NOTE>IN the reign of King <HI>William,</HI> this hou&s;e was remarkable for the violent hands laid on a va&s;t &s;eizure of <HI>French</HI> wines, to the amount of &s;ixty pipes, which had been &s;muggled into the great barn at <HI>Trelacre,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llana&s;a,</HI> de&s;tined for the u&s;e of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> gentry in this and the neighboring counties. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in tho&s;e days port-wine was in very little u&s;e in our country. The officers had conveyed this prize with &s;afety as far as <HI>Lletty Gone&s;t,</HI> where they intended to &s;leep that night. At midnight they were alarmed by the entry of multitudes of colliers, who tied every body in the hou&s;e neck and heels. They removed the wine into other carriages, and conveyed it into places &s;o &s;ecure that it never more could be heard of. Many of the colliers were ob&s;erved to have rings on their fingers, and fine linen. In fact numbers of them were the gentlemen intere&s;ted in the wine, and concerned in the re-capture, who mixed with
<PB N="51" REF="63">
the colliers, to direct them in their operations. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out for the di&s;covery of the offenders; but &s;uch was the fidelity of our people, that they were never detected. The poor tap&s;ter, in particular, knew perfectly well who they were, and large rewards were offered to him by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; but nothing could &s;hake his attachment to his friends. He lived long after, &s;upported by the grateful contributions of the neighboring '&s;quires.</P>
<P>HIGH above <HI>Lletty Gone&s;t</HI> &s;tands a &s;ummer-hou&s;e, built by my grandfather, to which he often adjourned with his gue&s;ts, to re|gale them with the delicious beer, brewed by the famous <HI>Jane.</HI> Many years after, when I became ma&s;ter of the e&s;tate, I al&s;o had my adjournment, but it was either to eat &s;hrimps or to drink tea. An hone&s;t vicar of a di&s;tant pari&s;h, who had been a mo&s;t intimate friend of my convivial grandfather, enquired whether I ever went to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e; and was an&s;wered, 'Now and then, to drink tea.' Struck with horror at the de|generacy of the grand&s;on, the good man with indignation ex|clamed,
<Q>DRINK TEA! his grandfather would have SCORNED IT!</Q></P>
<P>THE turnpike road de&s;igned for the enabling the &s;melters and others to convey our coal to the places of its de&s;tination, from the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> and <HI>Bychton</HI> pits, pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Lletty Gone&s;t,</HI> and goes along the &s;hore towards <HI>Holywell.</HI> In the &s;pace of a mile it pa&s;&s;es by three &s;melting-hou&s;es, <HI>Shop-goch,</HI> the property of Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,</HI> and <HI>Pen-y-Ro</HI> and <HI>Llanerch-y-m&ocirc;r,</HI> belonging to me. The la&s;t di&s;putes antiquity with mo&s;t in the county, the late works at <HI>Gadlis</HI> excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="64">ABOVE the la&s;t is the neat hou&s;e of <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> inhabited by my good friend and tenant Mr. <HI>Ralph Richard&s;on,</HI> who for &s;everal years had with great &s;ucce&s;s and integrity carried on the &s;melting bu&s;ine&s;s, with the advantage of &s;hipping the produce from the very &s;pot, after a &s;hort carriage to the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>A SMALL mar&s;h begins a little beyond <HI>Lletty Gone&s;t,</HI> and widens as it extends &s;outhward. It borders on the manor of <HI>Mo&s;tyn:</HI> but it&s;elf owns no lord but the king. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the va|luable remainder, as far as the manor of <HI>Cole&s;hill,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Flint.</HI> The minor of <HI>Greenfield,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Holywell,</HI> was long &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the property of one or other of two clamants, who fell into di&s;pute about the right. The matter was referred to two gentlemen of the law, eminent for their abilities, and not le&s;s &s;o for their probity. After examining all the proofs adduced by the rivals, they adjudged that neither had any clame to the lord&s;hip; &s;o it is now left to the freeholders under our &s;overeign lord the king: a rich tract for future inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> is the end of our pari&s;h on this &s;ide.

<P>ABOUT a mile higher up is <HI>Merton,</HI> the &s;eat of the Reverend Mr. <HI>John Foulkes.</HI> He derives his right to it from <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter and heire&s;s to <HI>Thomas Parry ap William Parry Wynne.</HI> She married <HI>John Foulkes,</HI> of <HI>Pen-yeba <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">luy,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Shy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iog,</HI> great-grandfather to the pre&s;ent owner, who died in <HI>July,</HI> 1667, and was interred in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church-yard.</P>

<P>IT is divided from <HI>Tre Bychton,</HI> in the lower part by the turn|pike road, which extends from the &s;ea-&s;ide to <HI>Henllan,</HI> &s;ixteen miles di&s;tant, originally de&s;igned for the conveyance of coal from the pits of this town&s;hip, and that of <HI>Tre Bychton,</HI> to the great lime-works near <HI>Denbigh.</HI> The fir&s;t act was obtained in 1768, the &s;econd in 1770: before which our roads were &s;carcely pa&s;&s;able. If either Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn</HI>'s family or our own wanted to get to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> we were to reach the &s;ea-&s;ide; then to <HI>Flint</HI> as we could, and from thence at low water cro&s;s the ford of the <HI>Dee,</HI> a way not always unattended with danger.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> gates, on this part of the turnpike road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE RHEWL.</NOTE> is a hamlet, called the <HI>Rhewl, yr Heol, platea,</HI> a way or &s;treet. On each &s;ide are a few hou&s;es. The <HI>Swan,</HI> a &s;mall ale-hou&s;e, my property, was noted for its va&s;t trade about the beginning of this century, when the coal trade was in the height of its pro&s;perity:

<HI>Thomas Edwards,</HI> who &s;everal years was tenant there, edu|cated a family of numbers of children, at no incon&s;iderable expence, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired by the tap at le&s;t fifteen hundred pounds.</P>

On this approach is a mo&s;t venerable avenue, which goes for a
<PB N="54" REF="66">
con&s;iderable way in a direct line; then turns &s;hort, and terminates with a view of the old part of the old man&s;ion. The park is &s;mall, but beautifully broken, and cloathed in various parts with fine oaks, and mo&s;t magnificent beeches; but amid&s;t the trees is &s;uffered to remain rugged with the ve&s;tiges of the antient col|lieries. The ground &s;lopes finely to the &s;ea, facing the North Ea&s;t. The trees grow with vigor clo&s;e to the water, unhurt by the rude winds with which they are affailed.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e is placed about half a mile from the &s;hore. I find &s;ome difficulty in making a de&s;cription. I &s;hall therefore refer the reader to the fir&s;t plate of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> &s;eats, by Mr. <HI>Boydel,</HI> and to my own, as the only method of giving him &s;ome idea of the &s;in|gularity of the &s;tructure.

<P>I CANNOT trace the time of building of this part of the hou&s;e.

The great gloomy hall is furni&s;hed with a <HI>Dais</HI> or elevated upper end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE OLD HALL.</NOTE> and with a long table for the lord and his jovial companions; and another in the &s;ide, the &s;eat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer.

<P>THE adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">KITCHEN.</NOTE> at a period when the odors of the pot and &s;pit were thought no ill &s;avors.

<P>IN the roof to this gallery are numbers of &s;mall roo&s;ting-holes, to which the inferior maidens of the family nightly repair to re&s;t from their labors.</P>
<P>AT one end of the gallery is a great room,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT ROOM.</NOTE> remarkable for a &s;ingular event. During the time that <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> was &s;ecretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed concealed from place to place, in order to form an intere&s;t among the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> who favored his cau&s;e on account of their re|&s;pect to his grandfather <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> their countryman. While
<PB N="58" REF="71">
he was at <HI>Mo&s;tyn,</HI> a party attached to <HI>Richard</HI> III. arrived there to apprehend him. He was then about to dine, but had ju&s;t time to leap out of a back window, and make his e&s;cape through a hole, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY VII.</NOTE> to this day, is called the King's. <HI>Richard ap Howel,</HI> then lord of <HI>Mo&s;tyn,</HI> joined <HI>Henry</HI> at the battle of <HI>Bo&s;worth;</HI> and after the victory, received from the king, in token of gratitude for his pre&s;ervation, the belt and &s;word he wore on that day; he al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Richard</HI> greatly to follow him to court: but he nobly an|&s;wered, like the <HI>Shunamiti&s;h</HI> woman:
<Q>I dwell among mine own people.</Q>
The &s;word and belt were pre&s;erved in the hou&s;e till within the&s;e few years. It is ob&s;ervable that none of our hi&s;to|rians account for a certain period of <HI>Henry</HI>'s life, previous to his acce&s;&s;ion. It is very evident that he pa&s;&s;ed the times when he di&s;appeared from <HI>Bretagny,</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> Many cotemporary bards, by feigned names, record this part of his life, under tho&s;e of the LION, the EAGLE, and the like, which were to re&s;tore the em|pire to the <HI>Britons:</HI> for the in&s;pired favorers of the hou&s;e of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> did not dare to deliver their ver&s;es in other than terms allegorical, for fear of the reigning prince.</P>

<P>IN the year 1631, Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,</HI> knight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW HOUSE, 1631.</NOTE> gave to the hou&s;e a very hand&s;ome addition; a &s;quare ma&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix bed-chambers, a very large eating-room, and a dining-room or drawing-room above, with a large bow-window in the middle of each. In that below are the arms of <HI>Gwynne</HI> and <HI>D'Arcy,</HI> well emblazoned on gla&s;s. The&s;e are complimentary to two great alliances; the one of Sir <HI>Roger</HI> him&s;elf with <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of the famous Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Gwydir;</HI> the other out of re&s;pect to the alliance with <HI>Bridget Savage,</HI> daughter of <HI>D'Arcie Savage,</HI> <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Leighton,</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> by whom the family acquired the great e&s;tates they po&s;&s;e&s;s in that county.

This piece of magnificence gave ri&s;e to a very coar&s;e proverb, applicable to inferior people, ambitious of acting beyond their &s;tation. Round his knees are &s;imilar gir|dles.

His boots are large, and of white leather, turned down at top, and ornamented in the &s;ame finical manner as the cap: &s;uch was the foppery of the times, even in &s;o manly a figure as was our knight of <HI>Mo&s;tyn.</HI> But then he was in full dre&s;s, his &s;purs of fine gold, with va&s;t &s;pur-leathers. His right hand re&s;ts on his &s;tick, his left on a table covered with a carpet mo&s;t ad|mirably painted; on it his hat, broad-brimmed, and with a mo&s;t immoderate crown. The date on his portrait is 1634; his age 67. He died on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 18th, 1642, and was interred at <HI>Whiteford,</HI> on <HI>September</HI> the 1&s;t.</P>
<P>HIS lady's neck (in a picture of the &s;ame date) is ornamented with a large ruff, &s;ingle and elevated; her right hand has in it a fan, and re&s;ts on an elbow-chair; on a finger of her left hand is a ring, tied to her arm by &s;everal black &s;trings.</P>
<P>SHE is dre&s;&s;ed in a hand&s;ome long gown, with a &s;a&s;h up to her very arms, exactly like the no-wai&s;ted fair of the pre&s;ent days.

<P>ON a bra&s;s plate, now covered with the <HI>Downing</HI> &s;eat, is a memorial of <HI>Morris Kyffin,</HI> of <HI>Maenan,</HI> who died (a youth) <HI>June</HI> 2d, 1610, at <HI>Bychton,</HI> on a vi&s;it to his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Jane,</HI> wife to <HI>Pyers Pennant.</HI></P>
<P>THE next town&s;hip to the village is in <HI>Whitford Garn.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GARREG.</NOTE> In this town&s;hip is <HI>Garreg,</HI> or <HI>The Rock,</HI> the highe&s;t land in the pari&s;h; it is a large inclo&s;ed hill, the property of Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn.</HI> Part of it is a fine turf, and excellent &s;heep-walk;

the &s;ummit, and part of the &s;ides, rocky. From <HI>Whiteford</HI> to the top is a continual a&s;cent. From this height the traveller may have an augu&s;t fore&s;ight of the lofty tract of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> from the crooked <HI>Moel Shabog,</HI> at one end, to the towering <HI>Pen|maen-mawr</HI> at the other; of the va&s;t promontory of <HI>Llandudno,</HI> and part of the i&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> with the great bay of <HI>Llanddulas,</HI> forming an exten&s;ive cre&s;cent; the e&s;tuaries of the <HI>Dee</HI> and the <HI>Mer&s;ey;</HI> and to the <HI>North</HI> (at times) the i&s;le of <HI>Man</HI> and the <HI>Cumberland Alps,</HI> the frequent pre&s;ages of bad weather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PHAROS.</NOTE>THE <HI>Romans</HI> took advantage of this elevated &s;ituation, and placed on its &s;ummit a <HI>Pharos,</HI> to conduct the navigators to and from <HI>Deva,</HI> along the difficult channel of the <HI>Seteia Portus.</HI> The building is &s;till remaining. It is tolerably entire; its form is circular; the inner diameter twelve feet and a half; the thickne&s;s of the walls four feet four inches. The doors, or entrances, are oppo&s;ite to each other; over each is a &s;quare funnel, like a chimney, which opens on the out&s;ide, about half-way up the building. On each &s;ide is a window. About four feet from the ground are three circular holes, lined with mortar, as is frequent in <HI>Roman</HI> buildings; and penetrate the whole wall, for purpo&s;es now unknown.</P>
<P>WITHINSIDE are the ve&s;tiges of a &s;tair-ca&s;e, which led to the floors, of which there appear to have been two. Along &s;uch part of the upper, which was con&s;picuous from the channel, are eight &s;mall &s;quare openings, ca&s;ed with free-&s;tone (the re&s;t of the building being of rude lime-&s;tone, bedded in hard mortar) and each of the&s;e were &s;eparated by wooden pannels, placed in deep grooves, the la&s;t &s;till in a perfect &s;tate. In each of the&s;e
<PB REF="134">

partitions were placed the lights, which the <HI>Romans</HI> thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep di&s;tinct, or to prevent from running into one, le&s;t they &s;hould be mi&s;taken by &s;eamen for a &s;tar. <HI>Periculum in corrivatione ignium, ne &s;idus exi&s;timetur.</HI></P>
<P>TO the building is very evidently a broad and rai&s;ed road, pointing from the ea&s;t; and near its upper end are the marks of a trench, which &s;urrounded and gave protection to this u&s;eful edifice. It certainly had in later times been repaired, or perhaps applied to &s;ome other u&s;e, for in one part is a piece of timber which could not have been aboriginal.</P>
<P>THE curious cro&s;s called <HI>Maen Achwynfan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAEN ACHWYN|FAN.</NOTE> or the &s;tone of lamentation, &s;tands in a &s;mall field oppo&s;ite to the gate which opens from the turnpike-road into <HI>Garreg.</HI> It takes its name, in all probability, from the penances, which were often fini&s;hed be|fore &s;uch &s;acred pillars; attended with weeping, and the u&s;ual marks of contrition: for an example, near <HI>Stafford</HI> &s;tood one called the <HI>weeping cro&s;s,</HI> a name analogous to ours. This is of an elegant form and &s;culpture; is twelve feet high, two feet four inches broad at the bottom, and ten inches thick. The ba&s;e is let into another &s;tone. The top is round, and includes, in rai&s;ed work, the form of a <HI>Greek</HI> cro&s;s. Beneath, about the middle, is another, in the form of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s: and under that, a naked figure, with a &s;pear in his hand. Clo&s;e to that, on the &s;ide of the column, is repre&s;ented &s;ome animal. The re&s;t is covered with very beautiful fret-work, like what may be &s;een on other pillars, of antient date, in &s;everal parts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I do not pre&s;ume (after the annotator on <HI>Camden</HI> has given up the point) to attempt a gue&s;s at the age; only mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that
<PB N="114" REF="136">
it mu&s;t have been previous to the reign of gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition among the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> otherwi&s;e the &s;culptor would have employed his chizzel in &s;triking out legendary &s;tories, in&s;tead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the &s;tone.</P>
<P>THOSE, who &s;uppo&s;e it to have been erected in memory of the dead &s;lain in battle on the &s;pot, draw their argument from the number of adjacent tumull, containing human bones, and &s;culls often marked with mortal wounds; but the&s;e earthy &s;e|pulchres are of more antient times than the elegant &s;culpture of this pillar will admit. This likewi&s;e (from the cro&s;&s;es) is evidently a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> monument. The former were only in u&s;e in pagan days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GELLI.</NOTE>THERE is likewi&s;e, near to it, an antient chapel, now a farm|hou&s;e, called <HI>Gelli,</HI> or the <HI>Hazel-grove,</HI> the name of an adjacent tract. This might have relation to the cro&s;s; as well as a place for performance of divine &s;ervice to the abbot of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk,</HI> who had a hou&s;e at no great di&s;tance. This tract (mis-&s;pelt by the <HI>Engli&s;h, Geteley,</HI>) with the wood (at that time on it) was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the abbot and convent, on the tenth of <HI>November,</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> before the death of our la&s;t prince. He al&s;o gave him power to grub up the wood; which by the nakedne&s;s of the place appears to have been done mo&s;t effectually.</P>
<P>FARTHER to the we&s;t is another inclo&s;ed mountain called <HI>Glol.</HI> my own property; part is covered with hazels and large white-thorn trees (perhaps a continuation of the <HI>Gelli,</HI>) part is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cky, part a fine &s;heep-walk. In many places were &s;e|veral druidical circles, which I believe are now injured by the removal of the &s;tones for various u&s;es. In the rougher parts of
<PB N="115" REF="137">
this inclo&s;ure are often &s;een vipers, which always prefer the dry and &s;unny parts of a country.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Sarn-Hwlkin,</HI> a little common to the ea&s;t of <HI>Glol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SARN-HWLKIN.</NOTE> was a very long but low <HI>tumUlus,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed by the vulgar to have been a <HI>giant's grave,</HI> from a tradition that one of our &s;ons of <HI>Anak</HI> had been there interred. It probably did cover the remains of &s;ome <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> heroes of the common &s;ize, who there found their grave, after &s;ome fierce action, I have before &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened before the place.</P>
<P>THE town&s;hip of <HI>Tre'r-Abbot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE'R-ABBOT.</NOTE> one of the eight which compo&s;e our pari&s;h, joins to this part of <HI>Tre-Mo&s;tyn.</HI> In it &s;tands the hou&s;e of the &s;ame name, originally the country-&s;eat of the abbots of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk,</HI> but long &s;ince the property of the <HI>Davies's,</HI> lately &s;old to <HI>Edward Jones,</HI> of <HI>Wepre,</HI> <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> From the proof that gentleman has given of his literary abilities in drawing up the re&s;olutions of the <HI>Holywell</HI> a&s;&s;ociation, in <HI>December</HI> 1792, I mu&s;t lament they are not oftener exerted, the occa&s;ion alone ex|cepted.</P>
<P>THIS town&s;hip was once exempted from the payment of tythes by a <HI>modus,</HI> originally granted by the abbot of <HI>Ba&s;ing|werk,</HI> but which by negligence has been totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e, in Mr. <HI>Miles Davies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MILES DAVIES.</NOTE> produced a very extraordi|nary genius indeed! The talents of this eccentric gentleman were poetical.

<P>HAVING reached the farthe&s;t part of our pari&s;h, to the north-we&s;t, I return along the great heath <HI>Mynydd Tegen,</HI> or <HI>Tegen-Mountain,</HI> which yet pre&s;erves the antient name of <HI>Tegengl,</HI> which comprehended the three modern hundreds of <HI>Cole&s;hill, Pre&s;tatyn,</HI> and <HI>Rudland.</HI> It had been the property of <HI>Edwin,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>Roderick</HI> the Great, and called prince of <HI>Tegengl.</HI> His <HI>Llys,</HI> or royal re&s;idence, was, in 1041, near <HI>Llaneurgan</HI> or <HI>Northop.</HI> This common, for I cannot call it mountain, &s;tretches along the whole of the higher parts of our pari&s;h, and is covered with the <HI>erica vulgaris,</HI> or common heath. It feeds numbers of &s;heep, and is part of the mineral tract of <HI>Flint&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN HELYG.</NOTE>THE manor of <HI>Mo&s;tyn,</HI> of which Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn</HI> is lord, includes the greater part of the mountain, and reaches to the &s;ea. It was derived from the heire&s;s of the hou&s;e, de&s;cended from her ance&s;tor, prince <HI>Edwin.</HI></P>
<P>A LARGE piece of water, now well &s;tocked with fi&s;h, made by Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,</HI> baronet, grandfather to the pre&s;ent owner,

lies near that end of the heath. In the winter it is the re&s;ort of ducks and teal.</P>
<P>ON the ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> pool, in <HI>Tegen</HI> mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAS CAPTAIN.</NOTE> is a grave bounded at each end by a rude &s;tone, above four feet high. It contains the remains of captain <HI>Edward Morgan,</HI> of the adjacent hou&s;e of <HI>Pl&acirc;s Captain,</HI> and of the re&s;pectable family of the <HI>Mor|gans,</HI> of <HI>Gwlgray,</HI> in the adjoining pari&s;h of <HI>Llan A&s;aph.</HI> Some years ago a per&s;on of &s;trange curio&s;ity opened the grave, and found the &s;keleton. On the head was a red cap, I think of velvet, and round his neck a &s;ilk handkerchief. By him lay his &s;word, and his helmet; and beneath the &s;keleton two bullets, which had fallen out of the body on its di&s;&s;olution; all which verify the report of his having been &s;lain in battle, or in &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;h during the civil wars, and that he was interred, according to his wi&s;h, under the &s;pot on which he fell. In a collection of pede|grees lent to me by <HI>Thomas Gryffith,</HI> <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Rhual,</HI> I find this &s;hort memorial of the captain, in the pedegree of his family: 'Capt. <HI>Edward Morgan,</HI> &s;lain at <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> rai&s;e.' If he was &s;lain in that county, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that his body would have been carried &s;o far; nor can I account for this relation, or for the body being found here, unle&s;s that the above is a mi&s;take, and that he fell in &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;h near to his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AT a &s;mall di&s;tance from <HI>Pl&acirc;s Captain,</HI> is <HI>Pl&acirc;s-mawr,</HI> at pre|&s;ent the property of Sir <HI>Edward Price Lloyd,</HI> bart. of <HI>Pengwern,</HI> in right of his worthy grandmother, <HI>Frances,</HI> daughter and heire&s;s to <HI>Bell Jones,</HI> &s;ecretary in the civil board of ordnance in the Tower.

<P>IT is the fir&s;t turnpike known on the <HI>Holyhead</HI> road.

<P>LAPIS CALAMINARIS, or calamine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALAMINE.</NOTE> is found in very great quan|tities almo&s;t the whole way I have mentioned, but increa&s;es in plenty as we advance ea&s;tward.

<P>IT appears that this mineral tract (which is called the <HI>Pant|vein</HI>) has yielded ore from very early times. In the la&s;t century there have been no very rich veins: but then it is almo&s;t always yielding &s;omething, and of later years has been particularly productive of calamine. In the beginning of this century Sir <HI>Thomas Gro&s;venour</HI> had a good mine of lead ore on the &s;ide of the road. My grandfather had another. The benevolent, chari|table Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> of <HI>Brinford,</HI> had another. The Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> of <HI>Celyn,</HI> had another.

<P><Q><HI>William Spencer,</HI> a miner, worked in <HI>Meilwr,</HI> (a mine near <HI>Holywell</HI>) in a clo&s;e confined &s;ituation, and where the ore was of a particular hard nature.

His bowels and abdominal mu&s;cles were much contracted, his pul&s;e feeble and low, he was &s;ubject to cold clammy &s;weats, and an unu&s;ual coldne&s;s of his extremities. In the efforts to vomit, he &s;ome|times

parted with a quantity of bile; and in each evacuation I ob&s;erved a depo&s;ition of a number of particles of lead, by parting with which he found great relief. The co&s;tivene&s;s continued &s;ometimes eight, nine, or ten days, notwith&s;tanding the repeated u&s;e of purgatives, (chiefly ca&s;tor-oil, in large do&s;es, which I found to be the mo&s;t effectual remedy). When this was got the better of, and a &s;tool procured, I ob|&s;erved in each evacuation a quantity of lead, by which, from the relief he obtained, his pul&s;e became better, the contraction of his bowels di&s;appeared, and likewi&s;e the cold clammy &s;weats. In three or four days, and in the two la&s;t attacks, he felt a &s;imilar acute pain in the lower part of his belly, attended with a &s;cantine&s;s, pain, and difficulty in voiding his urine.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNT ROCK.</NOTE>IN the town&s;hip of <HI>Tre Mo&s;tyn,</HI> near the &s;hore, is a cliff of a very &s;ingular appearance, looking like the &s;emi-vitrified lava of a volcano. The &s;tratum is in front univer&s;ally changed in its di&s;po&s;ition, and run into a horrible ma&s;s of red and black; often porous, in all parts very hard. In it is a hollow, a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire, which continued burning by its own <HI>phlogi&s;ton,</HI> (&s;ee Bi&s;hop <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> i. 167, to p. 200.) and cau&s;ed the phenomenon. Its fury chiefly raged
<PB N="137" REF="161">
towards the front, and dimini&s;hed gradually in the internal part of the bed; which, at &s;ome di&s;tance within land, appears only di&s;|colored. The &s;tratum is a &s;and-&s;tone of the common &s;ort (<HI>Da Co&s;ta's Fo&s;&s;ils,</HI> 133.) I am informed, that the&s;e appearances are not uncommon in <HI>Derby&s;hire;</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Ferber,</HI> an ingenious <HI>Swede,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitebur&s;t,</HI> our ingenious countryman, have taken notice of them in their writings.</P>
<P>I SHALL here introduce the mention of damps found in col|lieries, which are not unfrequent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A FIRE-DAMP.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes act with amaz|ing fury, and fatal con&s;equences. There are two &s;pecies, the &s;uffocating, and the fire. The la&s;t is very rare in the lead-mines, unle&s;s in tho&s;e parts where the <HI>&s;hale,</HI> or &s;tone attendant on coal, begins. The fir&s;t kills in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, by its mephitic vapor, and is a di&s;a&s;ter common to neglected vaults, and draw-wells. The other is inflammable, and burns and de&s;troys in a dreadful man|ner, as the colliers, through negligence in not &s;etting fire to the vapor before it gets to a head, do often experience. The mo&s;t tremendous in&s;tance was on <HI>February</HI> 3d, 1675, in a coal-work at <HI>Mo&s;tyn,</HI> which I &s;hall relate from the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions;</HI> and &s;o conclude the account of our mineral concerns.</P>
<P><Q>THE damp had been perceived for &s;ome time before, re|&s;embling fiery blades, darting and cro&s;&s;ing each other from both &s;ides of the pit. The u&s;ual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil. After a ce&s;&s;ation of work for three days, the &s;teward, thinking to fetch a compa&s;s about from the eye of the pit that came from the day, and to bring wind by a &s;ecure way along with him, that, if it bur&s;t again, it may be done without danger of men's lives, went down, and took two men
<PB N="138" REF="162">
along with him, which &s;erved his turn for this purpo&s;e. He was no &s;ooner down, but the re&s;t of the workmen that had wrought there, di&s;daining to be left behind in &s;uch a time of danger, ha&s;ted down after them; and one of them, more indi&s;|creet than the re&s;t, went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp pit, at which the damp immediately catched, and flew up, to and fro, over all the hollows of the work, with a great wind, and a continual fire; and, as it went, keeping a mighty great roaring noi&s;e on all &s;ides.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE men, at fir&s;t appearance of it, had mo&s;t of them fallen upon their faces, and hid them&s;elves as well as they could, in the loo&s;e &s;lack, or &s;mall coal, and under the &s;helter of po&s;ts; yet neverthele&s;s, the damp returning out of the hollows, and drawing towards the eye of the pit, it came up with incredible force; the wind and fire tore mo&s;t of their clothes off their backs, and &s;inged what was left, burning their faces and hands; the bla&s;ts falling &s;o &s;harp on their &s;kin, as if they had been whipt with cords. Some that had le&s;s &s;helter were carried fifteen or &s;ixteen yards from their fir&s;t &s;tation, and beaten again&s;t the roof of the coal, and &s;ides of the po&s;ts, and lay afterwards a good while &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;o that it was long before they could hear or find one another. As it drew up to the day-pit, it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye; and up it comes, with &s;uch a terrible crack, not unlike, but more &s;hrill, than a cannon, that was heard fifteen miles off, with the wind, and &s;uch a pillar of &s;moke as darkened all the &s;ky over-head for a good while. The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high, and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen
<PB N="139" REF="163">
yards long; yet the man's body, and other things from the pit, were &s;een above the tops of the highe&s;t trees, at le&s;t 100 yards. On this pit &s;tood a hor&s;e-engine, of &s;ub&s;tantial timber, and &s;trong iron-work; on which lay a trunk, or barrel, for winding the rope up and down, of above 1000 pounds weight; it was then in motion, one bucket going down, and the other coming up full of water. This trunk was fa&s;tened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron; yet it was thrown up, and carried a good way from the pit; and pieces of it, though bound with iron hoops and &s;trong nails, blown into the woods about; &s;o like|wi&s;e were the two buckets; and the ends of the rope, after the buckets were blown from them, &s;tood awhile upright in the air like pikes, and then came lei&s;urely drilling down. The whole frame of the engine was &s;tirred and moved out of its place; and tho&s;e men's clothes, caps, and hats, that e&s;caped, were afterwards found &s;hattered to pieces, and thrown among&s;t the woods a great way from the pit.</Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER of the&s;e damps happened in the &s;ame lands within my memory. In the year 1751,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANOTHER IN 1751.</NOTE> one man was beat to pieces in the bottom of the pit. Two others were taken up alive, but died &s;oon after; and two others &s;urvived, but were mo&s;t dread|fully burnt: and one who is now living, remains a dreadful evi|dence of the effects of the damp. All his fingers burnt off, and his vi&s;age terribly disfigured.</P>
<P>I SHALL here de&s;cribe agitations of the earth derived from other cau&s;es, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EARTHQUAKES.</NOTE> dreadful as they have been in di&s;tant coun|tries, have here occa&s;ioned little more than a momentary alarm.

<PB N="140" REF="164">
relate their effects, from the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> in which they are recorded. On <HI>April</HI> 2d, 1750, between the hours of ten and eleven at night, I was greatly alarmed with a violent &s;hock of an earthquake. I, who was in bed, was frequently moved up and down; and the bed, having ca&s;tors, was removed &s;ome &s;mall &s;pace from its proper &s;ituation.</P>
<P>DURING the &s;hock, a great noi&s;e was heard in the air; and, &s;ome nights before, lights were &s;een in the &s;ky; &s;uch as were previous to the earthquake in town.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 12, 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is very &s;ingular, that in three days after my return home, I &s;hould be reminded of my promi&s;e by a repetition of the very phenomenon on which I had engaged to write to you: for on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t, between four and five in the evening, we were alarmed with two &s;hocks of an earthquake; a &s;light one, im|mediately followed by another very violent. It &s;eemed to come from the north-ea&s;t, and was preceded by the u&s;ual noi&s;e. At pre&s;ent I cannot trace it farther than <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>THE earthquake preceding this was on the 29th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1780, about a quarter before nine in the morning. I was fore|warned of it by a rumbling noi&s;e, not unlike the coming of a great waggon into my court-yard. Two &s;hocks immediately followed, which were &s;trong enough to terrify us. They came
<PB N="141" REF="165">
from the north-we&s;t; were felt in <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> at <HI>Caernarvon, Llan|rw&s;t,</HI> in the vale of <HI>Clwyd</HI> &s;outh of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> at this hou&s;e, and in <HI>Holywell;</HI> but I could not di&s;cover that their force extended any farther.</P>
<P>THE next, in this retrograde way of enumerating the&s;e pheno|mena, was on the 8th <HI>September,</HI> 1775, about a quarter before ten at night. The noi&s;e was &s;uch as preceded the former; and the &s;hock &s;o violent as to &s;hake the bottles and gla&s;&s;es on the table round which my&s;elf and &s;ome company were &s;itting. This &s;eemed to come from the ea&s;t. I &s;ee in the <HI>Gentleman's Maga|zine</HI> of that year, that this &s;hock extended to <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and quite to <HI>Bath,</HI> and to <HI>Swan&s;ea</HI> in <HI>South Wales.</HI></P>
<P>THE earlie&s;t earthquake I remember here was on the 10th of <HI>April,</HI> 1750. It has the honor of being recorded in the <HI>Philo|&s;ophical Tran&s;actions;</HI> therefore I &s;hall not trouble you with the repetition of what I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to ob&s;erve, that I live near a mineral country, in a &s;ituation between lead-mines and coal-mines; in a &s;ort of neutral tract, about a mile di&s;tant from the fir&s;t, and half a mile from the la&s;t. On the &s;tricte&s;t inquiry I cannot di&s;cover that the miners or colliers were ever &s;en&s;ible of the &s;hocks under ground: nor have they ever perceived, when the &s;hocks in que&s;tion have happened, any falls of the loo&s;e and &s;hattery &s;trata, in which the la&s;t e&s;pecially work; yet, at the &s;ame time, the earthquakes have had violence &s;ufficient to terrify the inha|bitants of the &s;urface.</P>
<P>TO this ob&s;ervation I may add, that no eruptions of water were ever ob&s;erved to follow the &s;hocks; no water from the va&s;t
<PB N="142" REF="166">
re&s;ervoirs of that element, formed in the de&s;erted pits, which have often bur&s;t through the hollow which contained them, and more than once drowned the unhappy colliers who have been working beneath.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;een in prints an ob&s;ervation of &s;ome gentleman learned in earthquakes, that the cau&s;e of tho&s;e I have mentioned, which leave the &s;hattery &s;trata of the coal-mines unaffected, to have been electricity, which in the&s;e in&s;tances moved equally and gently, &s;o as not to cau&s;e any concu&s;&s;ion, or to go perhaps far below the &s;urface, &s;o that they leave the worked depths totally untouched.</P>
<P>NONE of the&s;e earthquakes were local; for, excepting the fir&s;t, all may be traced to very remote parts. The weather was remarkable &s;till at the time of every earthquake I have felt.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Nut-cracker, Br. Zool.</HI> ii. App. tab. iii. <HI>Latham,</HI> i. p. 400, is an accidental vi&s;itant of this i&s;land. One was killed in the gar|den at <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> in 1753.

In &s;ize it is about equal to that bird. Its colour is ru&s;ty brown, prettily marked with triangular &s;pots of pure white. It feeds on nuts (which it breaks with its bill) al&s;o on fir-cones, acorns, ber|ries, and in&s;ects.

<P>I SHALL conclude this mention of the birds with an account of a &s;ingular accident di&s;covered in a turkey which was killed for my table.

<P>I COULD wi&s;h (was it in my power) to add even to the cot|tages of my laborers two or three &s;mall fields, that they might have the comfort of a cow, to &s;upply their families with milk.

<P>BEFORE I take leave of the &s;ubject, let me define the &s;ize of a great and a &s;mall farm in this pari&s;h. Our greate&s;t farm is rented at &pound;. 110 <HI>per ann.</HI> at the rate of about 14 <HI>s. per</HI> acre. Our &s;mall farms have from 20 to 10 acres; and the rent <HI>per</HI> acre from 12 <HI>s.</HI> to 7 <HI>s.</HI> There may be in every pari&s;h in&s;tances of the exorbi|tant rai&s;e of rent: an evil mo&s;t frequently originating in the luxury of the landlord. Our rents are moderate, becau&s;e our gentry would blu&s;h to add one di&s;h to their table at the expence of the tenant. Mr. <HI>Wedge,</HI> in his <HI>Survey of Che&s;hire,</HI> p. 72, &s;peaks humanely and &s;en&s;ibly on the affected maxim of
<Q>high rents being a &s;pur to indu&s;try.</Q>
This (for I mu&s;t help Mr. <HI>Wedge</HI> with a &s;imile) re&s;embles the practice of the prudent planter, who wi&s;hes to quicken the indu&s;try of his negroes by the invigorating appli|cation of the cart-whip to their velvet &s;kin.</P>
<P>IN re&s;pect to lea&s;es, the utility is not perfectly agreed on. In our parts of <HI>North Wales</HI> I have known lea&s;e-tenants of very mo|derate rent continue on their farms their whole term without &s;uc|ce&s;s: and I know in this pari&s;h, and within a &s;mall di&s;tance, &s;eve|ral rack-rent tenants, with large farms, the mo&s;t pro&s;perous of any in the country. They improve boldly, and reap amply the fruits of their indu&s;try. They have confidence in their landlords, nor can they recollect more than one in&s;tance (and that indeed di&s;grace|ful enough <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Survey of North Wales, <HI>article</HI> Denbigh&s;hire, <HI>p. 17.</HI></NOTE>) in which they found it mi&s;placed. They are ma&s;ters
<PB N="166" REF="191">
of the knowlege of the &s;oil, and the nature of the climate of their own country. The appearance of their tenements does them credit. When they heard of a per&s;on &s;ent among them to inculcate the principles of good farming, they &s;miled at the de&s;ign, but &s;poke with gratitude of the kind intent of the <HI>Board of Agriculture. Denbigh&s;hire</HI> has long had its little board, for <HI>North Wales</HI> does not neglect its own intere&s;ts. An agricultural &s;ociety has, for a number of years, been e&s;tabi&s;hed in the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI> None who have vi&s;ited that beautiful tract can deny the general excellency of its culture.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> the antient practice of lea&s;ing is growing fa&s;t out of u&s;e: and agriculture will increa&s;e in that county in proportion.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>George Kay,</HI> of <HI>Leith,</HI> the mi&s;&s;ionary to whom was commit|ted the in&s;pection of every farm in the &s;ix counties of <HI>North Wales,</HI> favored me with a call &s;ome time in the la&s;t &s;ummer, and delivered to me his credentials from Sir <HI>John Sinclair.</HI> I was really at the time out of &s;pirits. At the &s;ame time, a report was circulated, that the object of the mi&s;&s;ion was to a&s;certain the reality of our land-tax; which was much credited by my coun|trymen. I was certain that the report was entirely unfounded; but I did not chu&s;e to trouble my&s;elf with militating again&s;t what I knew mu&s;t &s;peedily become &s;elf-confuted. I treated Mr. <HI>Kay</HI> with all civility. He left me, and I believe, through all his journey, (one place excepted) had no rea&s;on to complain of the reception he met with. Sir <HI>John Sinclair</HI> is a man of honor. He had not the le&s;t occa&s;ion to give him&s;elf the trouble of making to me &s;o earne&s;t an a&s;&s;everation of the purity of his intentions, as he did in his la&s;t favor. He is above taking clande&s;tine means of getting at any kind of information.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="192">WE lament that Mr. <HI>Kay</HI> did not &s;ee, in any one of our &s;ix counties, a &s;ingle cu&s;tom that could be u&s;eful to others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hints for Improvements in North Wales, <HI>p. 40.</HI></NOTE>. From the &s;tate of numbers of our farms, I &s;u&s;pect that we had pre|viou&s;ly adopted many methods of agriculture from <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> coun|ties, which mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned his remark. I would fain pay that compliment to his candour. On the whole, I fear that the mi&s;&s;ion has pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t unprofitably to both <HI>vi&s;itor</HI> and <HI>vi&s;it&egrave;.</HI> Nothing &s;eems to have been learned by the one, and nothing taught by the other.</P>
<P>WE thatch our hay-ricks with admirable neatne&s;s, and in that manner pre&s;erve the hay for years. I do not know a better expedient, even could the landlord afford to every little farm a hay-barn, or give them a moveable canopy, which is liable per|petually to be out of order. Nece&s;&s;ity in every country cau&s;es different modes of oeconomy. Send <HI>Shenkin ap Morgan</HI> on a &s;urvey of <HI>Cathne&s;s,</HI> and he would at fir&s;t &s;tare at the <HI>bykes</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Scotland,</HI> 1769. 3d ed. p. 201.</NOTE>, but would admire the ingenuity of the contrivances, and acknowlege the wi&s;dom of the farmer in the pre&s;ervation of his grain, where other means were wanting.</P>
<P>THERE are, certainly, both beyond the <HI>Tweed,</HI> and beyond the <HI>Dee,</HI> many thou&s;ands of acres, of which a tenant &s;hould be court|ed to attempt the cultivation, and be bribed by lea&s;es to &s;ettle upon them. In <HI>North Britain</HI> the practice is common. In <HI>North Wales,</HI> our mountain landlords rarely grant lea&s;es, po&s;&s;ibly from their not finding the nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>IN all the mineral part of <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> are numbers of &s;mall farms, tenanted by carriers, who entirely &s;upport them&s;elves by the
<PB N="168" REF="193">
carriage of the lead ore, and calamine or coal. The&s;e are reck|oned the mo&s;t &s;lovenly farmers we have. They apply them|&s;elves to carriage to &s;uch a degree, as to neglect their tenements. The minerals are the great natural &s;taple of this, and mo&s;t of the pari&s;hes; &s;o that the&s;e &s;pecies of farms are quite indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>LET not the little farmer, or the cottager, repine at the wealth of the great farmers. It is not many weeks &s;ince their empty &s;tomachs have been filled from the hoards of the latter. Had they not been able to form a &s;tock, or to enable by &s;ale others to do &s;o, what would have become of you? The good, the bene|volent, have been able to purcha&s;e from them the food that has contributed to pre&s;erve, for many months, you and your's from cruel want. The in&s;tances of the recent charities have not been equalled. I may &s;peak of the univer&s;al charities. But I will recal to your minds tho&s;e of your &s;everal neighborhoods. In public calamities little &s;ouls lie &s;quat in their holes: great &s;ouls ari&s;e, and are called forth to action; &s;ome from a generous &s;en&s;ibi|lity, others from &s;elfi&s;h motives. I cannot but confe&s;s my&s;elf to be among the latter. I am &s;elfi&s;h enough to wi&s;h to put out my money at le&s;t on rever&s;ionary intere&s;t, but that on &s;ecurity inconte&s;tible.

<P>THE &s;ame monarch left another &s;pecies of garri&s;on <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI> 208.</NOTE>; for he e&s;tabli&s;hed here a hou&s;e of knights templars, a military order introduced into <HI>England</HI> in the preceding reign.

<P>RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor; for it appears, that before his days the monks had only a chapel here.

<P>HOW the affair ended I cannot learn.

<P>A PIN-MILL was built in 1764, for the u&s;e of <HI>James Eden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PIN-MILL.</NOTE> pin-maker, who occupied it about two years, and then failed.

The&s;e great works are under the firm of the PARYS MINE COMPANY.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PARYS MINE COMPANY.</NOTE> The buildings were completed in the year 1780, and held under lea&s;e from Sir <HI>Pyers Mo&s;tyn,</HI> bart. owner of the whole &s;tream, excepting a &s;mall part. To Mr. <HI>Samuel William&s;on,</HI> chief agent of this part of the works, I am indebted for the account of the works carried on here. The&s;e are entirely confined to the manufacture of copper.</P>
<P>IN this department is a great forge for heating the cakes of copper, previou&s;ly to their being beat into pans, or rolled into &s;heathings, &amp;c. &amp;c. The wheels and machinery are &s;et in motion by the water from a large pool, parallel to the road, which is filled from the &s;tream, and let out by another channel to effect its purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THESE may be called the great magazines for the &s;upply of the royal navy with the various nece&s;&s;aries in copper, &s;uch as &s;heath|ings, bolts, and nails. Some of the bolts are twenty feet long, and &s;o hardened by rolling and battering, as to be capable of being driven almo&s;t to their heads, in the entrance forward, and run abaft of the &s;hips where the beds of timber are the thicke&s;t; which work is facilitated by boring with an anger two-thirds of the length.</P>
<P>SOME of the nails are a foot in length, and from that &s;ize to that of a &s;adler's cack.</P>
<P>RUDDER bands and braces are here made of an enormous

<P>THE number of men employed in the&s;e works is ninety-three. This is intended when they are in full employ: the &s;ame mu&s;t be under&s;tood of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE head of water to this mill is about twenty-one feet and a half, and the &s;uperficial &s;urface of the pool about 112,028 feet.</P>
<P>THE trade of the&s;e works is not confined to the royal navy. The merchant &s;hips are from hence &s;upplied with con&s;iderable quantities of &s;heathing, bolts, and nails, as are many of the &s;hips in the &s;ervice of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>FROM hence braziers are furni&s;hed with copper ve&s;&s;els of all kinds, and the materials for all the copper branches of their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE works on this river are &s;upplied with their copper from the <HI>Parys</HI> mine and <HI>Mona</HI> mine companies; the ore of which is &s;melted chiefly at <HI>Ravenhead,</HI> and <HI>Stanley,</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI></P>

<P>THE water-wheels are of ca&s;t-iron, upon a curious con&s;truction.

<P N="1">1&s;t. IT is a certain fact that the people con&s;tantly employed in the copper-manufactories are as healthy, and arrive to as great an age, as the generality of people employed in other occupations not connected with fire or metal; but they are &s;crupulous ob|&s;ervers of the antient law, which forbade to eat with unwa&s;hen hands; and they find it highly nece&s;&s;ary to perform a careful ab|lution of the whole body at le&s;t once a week, to rub off the cop|per du&s;t, which adheres to their bodies, and occa&s;ions violent eruptions of a green color, evincing, by the tinge, their origin. The pain and &s;ymptoms are ea&s;ily removed by wa&s;hing with clean water; but if that is neglected, the con&s;equences become &s;e|rious, and even to require chirurgical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="2">2d. YOUNG dogs, which have acquired a habit of licking cop|per &s;heets or bars, have never been known to &s;urvive long. The metallic virus by that means conveyed into the inte&s;tines &s;oon de&s;troys the animal by violent purging.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="210" REF="224">3d, YET it may de&s;erve notice, that the writer of the&s;e hints having formerly kept a great number of poultry running about the yard, he ob&s;erved that the fowls preferred drinking the water from a &s;hallow copper pan that lay out of doors, and was generally full of rain-water, tinged of a deep green color, to fre&s;h clear water, of which there was abundance. No ill effect was ever known to have happened to them from the green water, though a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of poultry re&s;orted to it for years.</P>
<P>THE writer of this having been employed on the &s;pot, from the fir&s;t opening of the ground for the foundations of the mill and other buildings, found frequent proofs that the &s;urface of the land had formerly been about fourteen or &s;ixteen feet lower than at the time the buildings were erected. His inducements to form that opinion were,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t.

<P>THE window in this chapel impends a va&s;t height over the bathing well.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL WINDOW.</NOTE> Several per&s;ons (not in their &s;ober &s;en&s;es) have leaped into the water, without receiving any other damage than the &s;mart cau&s;ed by the da&s;hing on the &s;urface from their exalted &s;tation. Within my memory, one <HI>John Blackwall,</HI> of <HI>Llana&s;aph,</HI> took a far more de&s;perate leap into the &s;ame water, from the church-yard wall, almo&s;t adjoining to the chapel.

<P>THE bathing-well is an oblong, 38 feet by 16, with &s;teps for the de&s;cent of the fair-&s;ex, or of invalids.

<P>ON the out&s;ide of the great well, clo&s;e to the road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LITTLE SPRING.</NOTE> is a &s;mall &s;pring, once famed for the cure of weak eyes. The patient made an offering to the nymph of the &s;pring, of a crooked pin, and

<P>THE well is common; for I find by a deci&s;ion of the court of chancery, on a law-&s;uit re&s;pecting the lord&s;hip of <HI>Holywell,</HI> be|tween Sir <HI>John Egerton,</HI> knight, and <HI>John Eldred;</HI> chancellor <HI>Elle&s;mere</HI> decrees,
<Q>That on calling to mind, that within the &s;aid manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory, he doth not think fit that the petitioner, or any other, &s;hould have the property thereof, notwith&s;tanding the general words of the grant of the manor: and therefore his lord&s;hip doth order, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;aid grant, that the well &s;hall-continue as now it is, or heretofore hath been; &s;aving to the petitioner, and his heirs and a&s;&s;igns, the benefit of the &s;tream and watercour&s;e, with the appertainances.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this &s;tream. One party makes it miraculous: the other a&s;&s;erts it to be owing only to natural cau&s;es. The advocates for the fir&s;t, deliver their tale thus:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SAINT WENE|FREDE.</NOTE>IN the &s;eventh century lived a virgin of the name of <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> of noble parents; her father's name was <HI>Thewith,</HI> a potent lord in the parts where <HI>Holywell</HI> now &s;tands; her mother's <HI>Wenlo,</HI> de|&s;cended from an antient family in <HI>Montgomery&s;hire,</HI> and &s;i&s;ter to St. <HI>Beuno. Beuno</HI> a&s;&s;umed the mona&s;tic habit, retired to <HI>Clynnog,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire,</HI> where he built a church and founded a con|vent. After completing this work of piety, he vi&s;ited his rela|tions in <HI>Flint&s;hire;</HI> and obtaining from his brother-in-law a little &s;pot at the foot of the hill on which he re&s;ided, erected on it a church, and took under his care his niece <HI>Wenefrede.</HI> It is pro|bable
<PB N="225" REF="241">
that the &s;aint u&s;ed occa&s;ionally to make &s;ome re&s;idence in this country; for near the entrance of the dingle, oppo&s;ite to the great cotton-work, are two &s;mall fields, called to this day <HI>Gerddi Saint Beuno,</HI> or the gardens of St. <HI>Beuno.</HI></P>
<P>A NEIGHBORING prince of the name of <HI>Cradocus,</HI> &s;on of king <HI>Alen,</HI> was &s;truck with her beauty, and at all events determined to gratify his de&s;ires.

<P>ST. BEUNO took up the head, carried it to the corps, and, offering up his devotions, joined it nicely to the body, which in&s;tantly reunited. The place was vi&s;ible only by a &s;lender white line encircling her neck, in memory of a miracle, which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed far that worked by St. <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> who marched in triumph after decapitation, with his head in his hands, from <HI>Mont martre</HI> to St. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire de l'abbaye de St. <HI>Denys,</HI> 76.</NOTE>; or that of St. <HI>Adelbertus,</HI> who, in like circum&s;tances, &s;wam acro&s;s the <HI>Vi&s;tula.</HI></P>

It originated in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church: but I clear that congregation from being concerned in any part of the orgies; which are, I fear, celebrated by per&s;ons of our own religion only, who flock here on that day for mo&s;t un&s;aintly ends. The day is called <HI>Dydd &s;ul y Saint,</HI> or the <HI>Sunday of the Saints.</HI> I wi&s;h I could trace the primaeval ceremonies, and whether one might not have been the <HI>Druidical</HI> cu&s;tom, the <HI>Dei&s;eal,</HI> or <HI>Dei&s;ol,</HI> or turning from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, according to the cour&s;e of the &s;un.

The T or cro&s;s refers to the church of St. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> within this mona&s;tery. Beneath are probably the arms of the hou&s;e, a &s;word and a key, &s;ymbols of its tutelar apo&s;tles; and round the margin is this in&s;cription:

A bell belonging to the church was al&s;o chri&s;tened in honor of her. I cannot learn the names of the go&s;&s;ips, who, as u&s;ual, were doubtle&s;sly rich per&s;ons. On the ceremony, they all laid hold of the rope; be&s;towed a name on the bell; and the prie&s;t &s;prinkling it with holy water, baptized it in the name of the Father, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stovely</HI>'s Hi&s;t. Churches, 130.</NOTE>. He then clothed it with a fine garment: after this the go&s;&s;ips gave a grand fea&s;t, and made great pre|&s;ents, which the prie&s;t received in behalf of the bell. Thus ble&s;&s;ed, it was endowed with great powers; allayed (on being rung) all &s;torms; diverted the thunder-bolt; drove away evil &s;pi|rits.
<PB N="229" REF="245">
The&s;e con&s;ecrated bells were always in&s;cribed. The in|&s;cription on that in que&s;tion ran thus:

<L>Ut pietate &s;ua, nos &s;ervet ab ho&s;te cruento.</L></Q>
And a little lower was another addre&s;s:
<Q>Protege l'rece pia, quos convoco, virgo <HI>Marta.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AFTER her death, her &s;anctity, &s;ays her hi&s;torian, was proved by numberle&s;s miracles. The waters were almo&s;t as &s;anative as tho&s;e of the pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da:</HI> all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief; the votive crutches, the barrows, and other proofs of cures, to this moment remain as evidences pendent over the well. The &s;aint is equally propitious to Pro|te&s;tants and Catholics; for among the offerings are to be found the&s;e grateful te&s;timonies from the patients of each religion.</P>
<P>THE Holy Father gave all encouragement to the piety of pil|grims to frequent this fountain.

The&s;e give &s;helter to multitudes of <HI>animal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae.</HI> The&s;e, it is probable, eat into the timber, and occa&s;ion the ill &s;ame our river has obtained of having a corro|&s;ive quality. Mr. <HI>William Chambers,</HI> of <HI>Holywell,</HI> has a&s;&s;ured me that he has &s;een the pen&s;tock and contiguous parts, which lie
<PB N="233" REF="249">
always under water, in &s;ome parts pierced with a few holes, in others eaten quite thorough; and that the planks appeared, after the mo&s;s was &s;eparated, as if con&s;uming by the wet rot. He adds, that the mo&s;s fir&s;t adheres to the oaken planks, and then it is that the &s;mall grubs eat into them; and in &s;ome parts quite penetrate, &s;o that the mo&s;s becomes &s;eemingly the nur&s;ery or receptacle of the grubs. The method u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the wheels, was by &s;craping the mo&s;s off annually.</P>
<P>THIS account is corroborated by Mr. <HI>Robert Tart,</HI> a very in|telligent ma&s;ter-carpenter, who &s;ays, that the wheels made of the be&s;t oak are de&s;troyed remarkably &s;oon by the <HI>Holywell</HI> &s;tream. A wheel which ought to have la&s;ted thirty years, has here been known to become unfit for u&s;e in about twelve. Mr. <HI>Tart</HI> recommends wheels made of pine or red deal, and that the &s;urface of the wheels be paid with pitch, tar, and ruddle; but even this has proved ineffectual, for the water occa&s;ions the mixture &s;oon to peel away. Mr. <HI>Donbavand</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the evil, as to &s;ub|&s;titute, in&s;tead of timber, wheels of ca&s;t-iron in the works which he &s;uperintends.</P>
<P>EDWARD DAVIES, an experienced wheel-wright, aged &s;eventy-five, confirms the above; and adds that red deal peri&s;hes in the &s;ame manner, but in a much &s;lower degree, by rea&s;on of its re&s;inous qua|lity. There have been formerly in&s;tances of oaken planks, which had laid long under water, being found as full of holes as if they had been eaten through by <HI>Norway</HI> rats; and were kept as curio&s;ities by the late Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Barker,</HI> of <HI>Brynmadin,</HI> or <HI>Gadlys.</HI></P>
<P>ON examination of the <HI>animalcula</HI> which occa&s;ion this da|mage, we found them to be the <HI>erucae</HI> or caterpillars of a certain

in&s;ect, which depo&s;ite its eggs in the mo&s;s, the <HI>Hyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um riparium, Flora <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cot.</HI> ii. 760. we found them in the &s;tate of <HI>erucae,</HI> about a third of an inch long, and of a whiti&s;h color.</P>
<P>WE found others arrived to the &s;tate of <HI>pupae</HI> or <HI>chry&s;alides,</HI> of the &s;ame length as the caterpillar, and of a deep brown color. Whether the&s;e de&s;tructive in&s;ects are <HI>ephemerae,</HI> or <HI>phryganeae,</HI> of the cla&s;s of in&s;ects which, by a wonderful direction of nature, de|po&s;ite their eggs in waters of different depths, I cannot a&s;certain. It is certain that the&s;e genera, before they a&s;&s;ume the in&s;ect form, remain under the water. They from the egg become cater|pillars; the&s;e caterpillars re&s;t a certain time in &s;hape of <HI>pupae,</HI> then bur&s;t out into flies or in&s;ects, after that in&s;tantly quit the watery element. In a &s;till day they may be ob&s;erved to make their appearance, preceded by a bubble: the in&s;ect immediately follows, and either takes to the air, or runs along the &s;urface of the water, before it ri&s;es into its new habitation.</P>

<P>AN account of the tythes will be given in the Appendix, with tho&s;e of <HI>Whiteford</HI> pari&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS vicarage even wants a globe, unle&s;s we call the garden to the hou&s;e by that name. Neither has it any other endowment, unle&s;s the &s;hare of tithes mentioned in the Appendix, and an ac|qui&s;ition of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s bounty of two hundred pounds. This, in the time of the Rev. <HI>Ellis Price,</HI> vicar, received the ad|dition of two hundred more, which lay at intere&s;t till the la&s;t year, when, on the donation of a hundred and fifty pounds from <HI>Je&s;us College,</HI> the whole was laid out in the purcha&s;e of a portion of the wa&s;te lands in the pari&s;h of <HI>Kilken.</HI> An act had been pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1793, for the purpo&s;e of inclo&s;ing the common, di|viding it among the freeholders, and &s;elling certain portions to defray the expences of the act, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. One part was bought with the above &s;ums, and &s;ettled on the mini&s;ter of <HI>Holywell</HI> and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in addition to their income; and &s;ay the activity of the pre&s;ent vicar, the ground has already been inclo&s;ed, drained, ploughed and &s;own! The other &s;upport of the vicars is the an|tient one,
<Q><HI>oblationes altaris,</HI> among which are reckoned the of|ferings

<P>THE vicarage hou&s;e, about the middle of this century, became &s;o ruinous as to be uninhabitable. In a few years it was rebuilt by the piety of two brothers, <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>John Barker,</HI> of <HI>Bryn|madyn,</HI> agents to the great &s;melting-company at <HI>Gadlys,</HI> who be|queathed to the vicar of <HI>Holywell</HI> 400<HI>l.</HI> for the purpo&s;e of build|ing a new glebe hou&s;e at <HI>Holywell,</HI> for him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, on the &s;ame &s;pot as that on which the old one &s;tood. It was fini&s;hed in the year 1760, and, with the adjacent premi&s;es, has been con|&s;iderably improved by the pre&s;ent vicar, the Reverend <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> and made a mo&s;t comfortable re&s;idence.</P>
<P>NOT far di&s;tant, at the very foot of the hill, above the well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> &s;tands the pari&s;h church, placed in that inconvenient &s;ituation, out of re&s;pect to the guardian &s;aint. It has only one bell, and that not to be heard at any di&s;tance; &s;o that the congregation is a&s;&s;em|bled by a walking &s;teeple, a man with a &s;mall bell, who &s;ounds the notice through every &s;treet.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent church was rebuilt in 1769, on the &s;ite of the old, and of the &s;ame length and breadth, <HI>viz.</HI> the length &s;ixty-eight feet, the breadth fifty-&s;ix. It is difficult to a&s;certain the antient archi|tecture of this church. Near the entrance, at the we&s;t-end, is a door-way, with an obtu&s;e <HI>gothic</HI> arch. The pillars, plain them|&s;elves, and with plain capitals, which &s;upport the gallery on each &s;ide of the nave, are original; and by the &s;pecimens given by Dr. <HI>Ducarel,</HI> in his <HI>Norman Antiquities,</HI> tab. xiii. appear to have
<PB N="238" REF="254">
been in u&s;e among the <HI>Saxons</HI> and the <HI>Normans.</HI> The arches, which might have confirmed my &s;u&s;picion that the church was built in the <HI>Norman</HI> reign, are taken away, but the &s;tyle con|tinued till about the year 1200. The church has a nave and two ailes, over which are two hand&s;ome galleries; and the whole is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain three thou&s;and people. It is plain, neat, and calculated for u&s;e.</P>

<P>IN the town are three places of wor&s;hip be&s;ides the church, two for the <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> and one for di&s;&s;enters. The la&s;t was built on my ground, by lea&s;e dated <HI>April</HI> 16, 1788, and is maintained by voluntary contributions. Of the former, one &s;upports a &s;ecular or pari&s;h prie&s;t. The other a gentleman of the late order of Je&s;uits. Both of their cures are endowed with lands ve&s;ted in tru&s;tees. Each of their hou&s;es had been a &s;pecies of hotel, probably de|&s;igned for the reception of pilgrims of better rank. One was called the <HI>Cro&s;s-keys,</HI> the other the <HI>Star.</HI> I remember at one or other of them <HI>Edward</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and other vi&s;itants of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRYN Y CASTELL.</NOTE>ABOVE the church is a hill called <HI>Bryn y Ca&s;tell,</HI> narrow and very &s;teep on the &s;ides, projecting at the end over the little valley.
<PB N="245" REF="261">
On this might have &s;tood the ca&s;tle of <HI>Treffynnon,</HI> or St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> built by <HI>Randle</HI> III. earl of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> in the year 1210 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 262.</NOTE>. There are not at pre&s;ent any ve&s;tiges left.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ingular that no mention is made in the <HI>Doom&s;day-Book</HI> of either chapel, church, or well; yet town&s;hips now of le&s;s note are named; &s;uch as <HI>Brunford, Caldecote,</HI> and others. Notwith|&s;tanding bi&s;hop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s opinion, I think the legend of St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> was known previous to that &s;urvey; for the very name of <HI>Holywell</HI> is <HI>Saxon,</HI> probably be&s;towed on it before the Conque&s;t, on account of the imputed &s;anctity of the well.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring is certainly one of the fine&s;t in the&s;e kingdoms; and, by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information, is found to fling out about twenty-one tons of water in a minute. It never freezes. In re&s;pect to the equality of the water in droughts, or after the greate&s;t rains, I find I mu&s;t place it among the vulgar errors. From the authority of Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Smalley,</HI> and other re&s;pectable manufacturers on the &s;tream, I di&s;cover that the variation is extremely great, and that there is a decrea&s;e in &s;ummer of more than one-third, and in great droughts of &s;till more, and after violent rains the increa&s;e is in like proportion: &s;ome even &s;ay it is one-half. As long as I remember, the fountain, after heavy falls of wet, became of a wheyey color. This is increa&s;ed to a great degree, grows more turbid, and even depo&s;its a mud upon the &s;tones.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MEI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> AND OTHER MINES.</NOTE>THE next to that, ea&s;tward, is <HI>Caleb Bell,</HI> a north and &s;outh vein, which is traced from the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Pen-y-Bal,</HI> de&s;cends from the mountain, towards the late <HI>John Denman</HI>'s, but as yet has not been traced to the road. This has in old times been very rich in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>THE old vein, or <HI>Pant Ithel,</HI> is another rich vein, which fir&s;t
<PB N="255" REF="271">
appeared in <HI>Panta&s;a,</HI> and yielded great quantities of ore and ca|lamine. From thence cro&s;&s;es <HI>Butler's fields,</HI> and <HI>Pen-y-Bal,</HI> and then to <HI>Coetia fawr;</HI> from thence to <HI>Pant Ithel,</HI> where it de|&s;cends near <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ynford</HI> hou&s;e, and cro&s;&s;es the road into <HI>Highgate</HI> te|nement, the property of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Trelunnian.</HI> It then enters into my tenement called <HI>Meilwr,</HI> and was the fir&s;t place in which ore was found in the level; the lea&s;e of which was granted by my father, on <HI>December</HI> the 20th, 1754.</P>
<P>THE next is the <HI>Highgate</HI> vein, which about <HI>Pi&s;till</HI> had branch|ed into many &s;trings. As they advance from <HI>Pi&s;till</HI> ea&s;tward, they enter <HI>Highgate</HI> tenement, and become very productive, both in Mrs. <HI>Williams</HI>'s land, and al&s;o my own, which for many years poured on me in great abundance its mineral wealth. I never con&s;idered this &s;pecies of riches but of the mo&s;t precarious nature, liable in&s;tantly to fail: I therefore &s;ecured them on the be&s;t of tenures, and purcha&s;ed with them the moiety of the <HI>Bagillt-Hall</HI> e&s;tate, which has turned out to me uncommonly fortunate. I al&s;o was enabled by another part to improve my hou&s;e at <HI>Downing</HI> to what it now is.</P>
<P>EVERY thing has its end. The vein or veins at length grew poorer. A great fire-engine was erected a few years ago, in hopes of clearing the water, and getting at the ore which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left in the &s;oles.</P>
<P>THE level begins at the bottom of the north &s;ide of <HI>Nant|hill-brwc,</HI> and runs &s;outh-we&s;t. How uncertain is mineral know|lege, even among the mo&s;t knowing! The object of the le&s;&s;ees was the working up to a certain rich vein, named the <HI>hard &s;haft,</HI> in the lands belonging to <HI>Brynfordd.</HI> An object that never

yet has been obtained. But in pur&s;uit of that object they mo&s;t unexpectedly met with the veins which produced &s;o much wealth to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and my&s;elf. Perhaps I fall &s;hort in my e&s;timate if I &s;ay, that to le&s;&s;ors and le&s;&s;ees, the total amount mu&s;t have exceeded a hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>THE next vein to the <HI>high-gate,</HI> is a &s;tring within five yards of the <HI>high gate,</HI> which his been very productive. Into the field called <HI>Coetia Y&s;cubor,</HI> the <HI>hard &s;haft</HI> vein is expected to enter, and cro&s;s the whole breadth, into the ground of <HI>Pen y pylle.</HI> And at the very corner of the &s;ame field, another vein cro&s;&s;es into the &s;ame land, and has been tolerably rich.</P>
<P>I NOW quit my mineral territories in this part of the country; and cro&s;s over the road to <HI>Pen y pylle,</HI> the &s;eat of <HI>Hugh Hum|phreys,</HI> e&s;quire, de&s;cended from <HI>Edwyn,</HI> prince of <HI>Tegengl.</HI> That gentleman has had large &s;hare of the mineral wealth. The vein <HI>Re&s;t y cegin</HI> pa&s;&s;es under his very hou&s;e and garden. The mine-hillocks fill the land: but by his judicious walks and plantations, which now cover them, he has turned them into beauties. The vein continues to his grounds, below his hou&s;e, and may probably be a &s;ource of new wealth.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lucky Venture,</HI> is the la&s;t vein I can mention in this pa|ri&s;h, which ranges from the mountain, and cro&s;&s;es the road into a corner of a field of Mr. <HI>Humphreys,</HI> and immediately from thence into the land belonging to <HI>Edward Jones,</HI> e&s;quire, of <HI>Wepre,</HI> in which abundance of ore has been got.

in 1786, and the works were pulled entirely down, after &s;tanding the term of the agreement, which was forty-four years.</P>
<P>THE re&s;pectable company, long known by the name of the <HI>Governor and Company for &s;melting down Lead with Pit Coale and Sea Coale,</HI> by the royal charter, granted in the 4th of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> began bu&s;ine&s;s in this county about the year 1700. They flouri&s;hed with a mo&s;t fair reputation for a great number of years, till their decline, either through want of ore, or other in|evitable cau&s;es, induced them to remove their antient furnaces to &s;ome works, built by the late Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Smedley,</HI> on the bank above <HI>Bagillt.</HI> Tho&s;e they purcha&s;ed; and continued &s;melting, un|der the direction of their agent, Mr. <HI>William Smith</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To whom I am much indebted for information re&s;pecting the <HI>Gadly:</HI> company.</NOTE>, till they &s;old them to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Griffith</HI> and <HI>A&s;tet,</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> This company was often called the <HI>Quakers Company,</HI> from the number of per|&s;ons of that mild per&s;ua&s;ion being of it.</P>
<P>DURING the pro&s;perity of the works (which was very long) they produced va&s;t quantities of lead and bullion; of the latter they extracted from the lead, between the year 1704 and 1744, not le&s;s than 430,604 ounces.

<P><PB N="265" REF="281">AS a hou&s;e of indu&s;try is now in contemplation by the pari&s;h of <HI>Holywell,</HI> is there not a po&s;&s;ibility of allotting certain portions of the wa&s;te lands for &s;ale, to rai&s;e a fund to carry on the work, or to give in mortgage to &s;uch per&s;ons who may be willing to advance money for &s;o &s;alutary a purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>THE town of <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> and I may &s;ay of every manufactur|ing county, have &s;ucceeded to admiration in their attempts, and &s;hould be examples to us. This neighborhood is now filled with men of bu&s;ine&s;s, capable of the conduct of &s;uch works: be&s;ides, the cotton and twi&s;t company have it in their power to expend annually above &pound;. 1800 in the town, in picking the cotton; but from the di&s;like of the poor to that employ, are obliged to &s;end the materials to di&s;tant places (&s;ee p. 216.) whereby the town and neighborhood lo&s;e the expenditure of that great &s;um among them. We &s;quires are le&s;s qualified for operations which require vigor and activity, but we can contribute countenance and power, equally e&s;&s;ential to the &s;up|port of the de&s;ign. I know the poor will be aver&s;e to it at fir&s;t: but when they recollect how long they had &s;tarved under the carele&s;s care of over&s;eers, and that they will be placed under the immediate attention of vi&s;itors con&s;i&s;ting of their neighbors, and that they will not be removed beyond the reach of their friends and relations, whom they may &s;ee at proper times, I tru&s;t they will be &s;atisfied. To bani&s;h the poor from the po&s;&s;ibility of the occa|&s;ional comfort of their deare&s;t relatives, would be un&s;peakable cruelty. I, therefore, mu&s;t ever condemn a county hou&s;e of in|du&s;try, in which that e&s;&s;ential con&s;olation is made difficult or im|po&s;&s;ible, to the inmates from di&s;tant parts.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="282"><NOTE PLACE="marg">VITRIOL-WORKS.</NOTE>ON gaining the &s;ummit of this road, appears a vitriol-work, the property of Mr. <HI>Donbavand,</HI> placed under the care of Mr. <HI>John Jones,</HI> of <HI>Holywell,</HI> an able chymi&s;t. His operations are di|rected to three articles: blue vitriol, or vitriol of copper, which is made by di&s;&s;olving copper in oil of vitriol or acid of &s;ulphur. After the &s;olution has taken place, the produce is di&s;&s;olved in boiling water, evaporated down to a given weight, and put in coolers to evaporate.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of this &s;pecies of vitriol is in dying cottons of a green or olive color, and hats and woollen cloths black; and al&s;o for making green verditer for painting in oil or water-colors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERDITER.</NOTE> by precipitation with whiting.</P>

He is ninth in de&s;cent from the abbot, and third from <HI>Gifford Pennant,</HI> &s;econd &s;on of <HI>Edward Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Bagillt,</HI> by <HI>Catherine,</HI> daughter of <HI>Edward Kyna&s;ton,</HI> of <HI>Otely,</HI> in the county of <HI>Salop.</HI> He went to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in the time of <HI>Oliver Cromwel;</HI> had a grant of lands there <HI>November</HI> 5th, 1665; &s;ettled in the pari&s;h of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and died in 1677. His lord&s;hip's property in that i&s;land is immen&s;e, and his addition to it in the county of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> in this his native i&s;land, is very con&s;iderable, by his marriage with <HI>Anne Su&s;anna,</HI> daughter and heire&s;s of the late general <HI>Warburton,</HI> of <HI>Winnington,</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> With &s;ingular fortune, by this match his lord&s;hip po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> the &s;eat and e&s;tate belonging to the family of <HI>Angbarad,</HI> his di&s;tant ance&s;tre&s;s; from whom lady <HI>Penrhyn</HI> is by her grandmother al&s;o de&s;cended. All the&s;e fortunes they enjoy with dignity, and with utility to their numerous tenantry. I particularly allude to tho&s;e about <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> where he has made
<PB N="271" REF="288">
his va&s;t &s;late-quarries an object of admiration to travellers, pro|fitable to him&s;elf, and the &s;ource of opulence to the &s;urrounding country. I had not, at the publication of my <HI>Wel&s;h Tour,</HI> oppor|tunity of informing my&s;elf about the&s;e important works; I, there|fore, give a brief &s;ketch of their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>WHEN his lord&s;hip came to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fortunes in part of the i&s;land, he found great appearance of neglect and poverty among the tenantry; the &s;late-quarries, one great &s;taple of the country, in a very low &s;tate; and the export of that valuable article did not annually exceed a thou&s;and tons; and there were not four carts on his e&s;tate, and only three in all <HI>Nant-Frankon,</HI> and the roads &s;carcely pa&s;&s;able for a hor&s;e. By his judicious management a happy rever&s;e took place. The carriages have encrea&s;ed to the pre&s;ent time, to rather more than a hundred broad-wheel carts and waggons.</P>
<P>PORT <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> formerly <HI>Aber-cegid,</HI> is now highly improved by quays for the reception of ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that tho&s;e of two hun|dred tons burden can lie clo&s;e to them, and take in their cargo. Ve&s;&s;els of above three hundred tons can enter the port, but cannot get clo&s;e to the quays.</P>
<P>BEFORE the country experienced his lord&s;hip's improving ta|lents, not above a thou&s;and tons have been exported in the year. In 1794 the export amounted to fifteen thou&s;and. In 1795 there was every rea&s;onable hope that it would have increa&s;ed to twenty thou&s;and, but the tax on the &s;lates has given it a check; though it is expected that the return of peace, and a modification of the duty, will re&s;tore the progre&s;s of the trade.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="289">THE &s;tate-quarries are a few miles from the port, near the entrance into <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t-Frankon.</HI> From four to five hundred men are employed in them. They live in very elegant cottages, prettily di&s;po&s;ed in groups. Here is a butcher and a &s;hoe-maker, but no corrupting ale-hou&s;e is permitted. His lord&s;hip has built a mar|ket hou&s;e, &s;o that the workmen need not wander for the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions. Let me not forget that he erected an elegant pa|vilion, called <HI>Ogwen Bank,</HI> with a kitchen, &s;tables, &amp;c. which lord and lady <HI>Penrhyn</HI> often vi&s;it, either to examine into this creation of theirs, or to amu&s;e their gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>HIS lord&s;hip was elected member for <HI>Petersfield,</HI> in the fir&s;t parlement of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty; and in 1767 vacated his &s;eat to be elected for <HI>Leverpool.</HI> He was returned in 1768, 1774, and again in 1784.

Our humble curate is far di&s;tanced by the other two. He remains a drudge in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, <HI>hone&s;t&acirc; pauperie,</HI> re&s;ulting from fraternal affection, in ex|erting every nerve to &s;upport two &s;i&s;ters, who re&s;t on him for the poor pittance he can afford to give.</P>
<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing the turnpike-gate, I find my&s;elf on the conti|nuance of the turnpike-road from <HI>Greenfield</HI> to <HI>Flint.</HI> The di&s;|tance from the <HI>Greenfield</HI> gate to <HI>Flint</HI> is only four miles. Let me add, that within little more than one mile from the fountain of <HI>St. Wenefrede,</HI> at <HI>Holywell,</HI> to the gate ju&s;t mentioned, <HI>Britain</HI> may be challenged to &s;hew, on an equal &s;pace, a &s;imilar a&s;&s;emblage of commercial buildings, or of capitals employed in erecting and in carrying on their &s;everal objects. I refer the reader back to p. 203, for an account of tho&s;e upon the <HI>Holywell</HI> &s;tream. I re|&s;ume the chain of commerce, from the copper-forge, the lowe&s;t link, which reaches to the very road.</P>
<P>A LITTLE to the right of the turnpike-gate, the little rill <HI>Nant-hil-brwe</HI> divides the &s;mall town&s;hip of <HI>Whel&s;tone</HI> from that of <HI>Holywell.</HI> This tract, of which I have the tythes, is one of the portions of <HI>Bagillt</HI> town&s;hip, which is very large, and &s;ubdi|vided into two others, <HI>Bagillt-&s;awr,</HI> and <HI>Bagillt-fechan.</HI></P>

the &s;melting lead-ore. It has the advantage of a &s;mall &s;tream, which improves the operation of the latter.</P>
<P>IT turns two wheels, one of which is twenty-four feet in dia|meter, and from the &s;ize and breadth makes a noble appearance. At each end of the&s;e wheels is a balance-wheel; one of them &s;ets the great refining bellows in motion, the other that of the &s;lag|hearth.</P>
<P>HERE is al&s;o a curious contrivance for &s;aving the calx of the lead-ore, which would otherwi&s;e have gone away in &s;moke. It be&s;ides le&s;&s;ens the bad effects on the grounds above. For this purpo&s;e two brick flues have been con&s;tructed, one from each furnace; each of them is horizontal, and is &s;upported by three arches, and over each is a channel to contain a &s;mall current of water, for the purpo&s;e of turning the wheels, and al&s;o to con|den&s;e the &s;moke in its pa&s;&s;age. The&s;e flues converge, and meet a little beyond the third arch, and terminate in the conden&s;ing room, to the walls of which the calx adheres. This room is opened three times a-year: the calx is taken out, and re-&s;melted with &s;ome profit.</P>
<P>THE two flues, in i&s;&s;uing out of the building, are united in one, and are continued, forming a right angle for a very con&s;iderable way. Out of the end ri&s;es a vertical flue, forty-three feet high, out of which the &s;moke i&s;&s;ues. The length of the horizontal flues which pa&s;s over the arches is fifty-&s;even feet; of the &s;ingle one which pa&s;&s;es from the room which catches the calx, is two hundred and ten feet.</P>

<P>THE collieries near the&s;e works have been very con&s;iderable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLLIERIES.</NOTE> I remember, about forty years ago, there was between twenty and thirty thou&s;and tons of coal upon bank, the greate&s;t quan|tity, perhaps, ever &s;een together. The pits were then worked by the <HI>Gadlys</HI> company. The company had imprudently given
<PB N="276" REF="293">
their agent, one <HI>Lance&s;ter,</HI> an unlimited order for rai&s;ing the coal. This he found &s;o profitable to him&s;elf, that he never de|&s;i&s;ted till the di&s;covery was made of his &s;elfi&s;h views. To ex|pedite the working, he engaged numbers of colliers from <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> and was the fir&s;t in this country who made u&s;e of hor&s;es under ground. The coal might have lain on the bank to this day, if a di&s;pute had not ro&s;e between the city of <HI>Dublin</HI> and the coal-adventurers at <HI>Whitehaven.</HI> This occa&s;ioned the citi|zens of <HI>Dublin</HI> to purcha&s;e this great &s;tock, which was all carried away before the differences were &s;ettled.</P>
<P>FOR a con&s;iderable time after this glut of coal, the collieries declined greatly, and became very low, till they were revived of late years by the &s;pirit and per&s;everance of Mr. <HI>Roger Ellis,</HI> of <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Flint,</HI> who has erected a powerful fire-engine on the road-&s;ide, between <HI>Greenfield</HI> turnpike-gate and <HI>Flint,</HI> and rai&s;es great quantities of that important re|qui&s;ite.</P>

<P>A CRUEL kind of quinzy has of late years infe&s;ted the&s;e pa|ri&s;hes, and others adjacent.

The average lo&s;s was four or five in &s;even. In this vi&s;itation the di&s;ea&s;e did not attack adults; not that in&s;tances are wanting in other places of its attacking grown-up per&s;ons. In <HI>September,</HI> 1771, a Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> his wife and mother, were buried in one vault in <HI>Bunhill-fields.</HI> His daughter fell a victim al&s;o, and made the &s;um of the family, who died at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame malignant di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE name given by the learned to this fatal di&s;ea&s;e, is <HI>angina maligna,</HI> and <HI>cynanche maligna. Cynanche,</HI> becau&s;e the patients are often ob&s;erved to protrude their tongue far out of their mouth, like an over-heated dog.</P>

<P>I CANNOT trace the progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e any farther north|ward than my own country. If it has not made any advances towards the colder climates, it may be deemed a malady of the warm and temperate parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THAT it has found its way to the New World, appears from the following in&s;tances. In 1746 it vi&s;ited many parts of <HI>North America,</HI> from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> and
<PB N="281" REF="298">
with a rage unknown in <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for in <HI>New-England</HI> it depopulated whole villages. And that it either continues on the continent, or has re-vi&s;ited it, is evident from its having appeared in <HI>New York,</HI> in the year 1771.</P>
<P>THE <HI>cynanche trachialis,</HI> or <HI>croup,</HI> has appeared here too fre|quently. A few years ago it de&s;troyed not fewer than &s;ix chil|dren in the family of a re&s;pectable farmer in a neighboring pari&s;h.</P>

There is no limiting the antiquity of the &s;melting-works; for we have proofs of very con&s;iderable ones having been near the town of <HI>Flint,</HI> at a place called <HI>Croes Ati,</HI> which is evident from the quantity of &s;coria of lead, bits of lead-ore, and frag|ments of melted lead, di&s;covered in &s;everal places.

<P>TO return to the works in que&s;tion. They are frequently known by the name of the <HI>&s;alt-works;</HI> which po&s;&s;ibly implies that the &s;ite had been occupied by works of that nature, prior to the exi&s;tence of the &s;melting-works. They have been occu|pied

<P>HERE it may not be improper to mention, that though the tribes are generally con&s;idered as the nobility of <HI>Wales,</HI> yet are there many ancient <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> families of high re&s;pectability, who de|rive not their de&s;cent from any of them.

<HEAD>CORRECTIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> TITLE PAGE to <HI>Whiteford,</HI> the date 1796.&mdash;I reque&s;t that this may be read 1795. It was expected that the whole book would have been printed in that year; but by various delays, too well known to authors, it was not completed till the month of <HI>March</HI> 1796. I therefore beg the reader would con&s;i|der that the &s;everal references which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to relate to 1796 can only intend 1795: for example, p. 161. l. 9. 'next &s;ea&s;on' means the wheat-&s;owing &s;ea&s;on of that year. 'In the next year,' means 1796. The attentive reader will di&s;cover many other reference of that kind.</P>
<P>PAGE 99, after paragraph 2d.&mdash;We retain in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church the decent &s;ervice of praying for the &s;ick, in&s;tead of lazily &s;inking it into the xxixth &s;upplicatlon of the <HI>Litany.</HI> The prayers on that occa&s;ion are &s;o pathetic, &s;o admonitory to the congregation, that I am amazed that any mini&s;ter &s;hould remain in&s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I NOW cannot but mo&s;t earne&s;tly exhort the &s;quires of every pari&s;h to attendance on divine &s;ervice, if it was only to hear the &s;ad catalogue of the mi&s;erable objects which compo&s;e the large&s;t part of tho&s;e for whom the devotions I allude to are intended. It will direct their benevolence to their relief. They may find among them objects of their charity, whom they may never otherwi&s;e have heard of. They may find tenants to whom they ought to be fathers. They certainly will find congenerous beings, to whom every duty of humanity is enjoined by the SA|VIOUR of the world: This I &s;hould hope is thus irre&s;i&s;tibly enforced:</P>
<Q><PB N="324" REF="343"><P>COME, YE BLESSED OF MY FATHER, INHERIT THE KINGDOM PREPARED FOR YOU FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.</P>
<P>FOR I WAS AN HUNGRED, AND YE GAVE ME MEAT; I WAS THIRSTY, AND YE GAVE ME DRINK; I WAS A STRANGER, AND YE TOOK ME IN; NAKED, AND YE CLOATHED ME; I WAS SICK, AND YE VISITED ME; I WAS IN PRISON, AND YE CAME UNTO ME.</P>
<P>THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS ANSWER HIM, SAYING, LORD, WHEN SAW WE THEE AN HUNGRED, AND FED THEE? OR THIRSTY, AND GAVE THEE DRINK?</P>
<P>WHEN SAW WE THEE A STRANGER, AND TOOK THEE IN? OR NAKED, AND CLOTHED THEE?</P>
<P>OR WHEN SAW WE THEE SICK, OR IN PRISON, AND CAME UNTO THEE?</P>
<P>AND THE KING SHALL ANSWER, AND SAY UNTO THEM, VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN, YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME.</P></Q>
<P>To the&s;e benedictory ver&s;es let me add one, in which the penalty, as well as the reward is united. I cannot re&s;i&s;t the im|pul&s;e, as it is &s;o admirably adapted to the times. It &s;hall be followed by an extract from p. 164 of this work, which I com|municated to the public through the channel of the <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> paper, followed by &s;ome declarations to prevent the mi&s;taking of any part. I fervently wi&s;h to promote a friendly agreement between landlord and tenant; between tenant and every poor laborer. The benevolent Duke of BEAUFORT, and I believe others of the benevolent GREAT, have made the attempt; and, to
<PB N="325" REF="344">
the glory of landlord and tenant, are to this moment di&s;pen&s;ing their generous plan to a grateful people. Such an agreement was entered into by the farmers of part of this and a neighbor|ing county; but to their infamy, many of them withdrew from their words and their &s;ignatures. May the landlords become the in&s;truments of compelling them to accept the ble&s;&s;ing offered in the la&s;t part of the line, and to &s;hun the cur&s;e denounced in the fir&s;t! There is one de&s;cription of men, on whom it &s;hould fall in a mo&s;t exemplary manner. The badger, or factor, employed to exhau&s;t the &s;tock of corn and other provi&s;ions, not by fair agreement, but by openly rai&s;ing the price, by offering more than the farmer would have a&s;ked; and even telling them, in open market, 'A&s;k what you will, and we will give it.' The poor, &s;ince the repeal of the 5th and 6th of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. by the 12th of <HI>George</HI> III. are left defencele&s;s. The means of inflicting the pu|ni&s;hment by the &s;tatute is taken away, and they are to &s;eek ju&s;tice through the tedious expen&s;ive labyrinths of the common law.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to convey, through the channel of your paper, a paragraph from a book which is &s;till in the pre&s;s:</P>
<P><Q>I would never grant a lea&s;e to a great corn-tenant. I would pre&s;erve a power over his granary, which legi&s;lature will not, or
<PB N="326" REF="345">
cannot a&s;&s;ume. Should he attempt by exportation to exhau&s;t it in years of &s;carcity, and not leave a &s;ufficient &s;upply for the country which produced the grain; &mdash; &s;hould he attempt a mo|nopoly,&mdash;&s;hould he refu&s;e to carry a proper quantity to the next market;&mdash;or &s;hould he refu&s;e to &s;ell, to the poor who can|not attend the market, corn in &s;mall quantities, I WOULD INSTANTLY ASSUME THE POWER OF THE LANDLORD, AND EXPEL HIM FROM MY ESTATE. A ju&s;t puni&s;hment for the tenant, who, through rapacity, declines to comply with my de&s;ires, excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public.</Q></P>
<P>THE end which we wi&s;h by the above radically to correct, may &s;oon be pa&s;t cure, I therefore commit the extract to your hands. The evil is entirely local; other parts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are po&s;&s;ibly unaffected by it, and have no occa&s;ion to take alarm. We do not wi&s;h the farmers &s;olely to feed the poor; we only re|que&s;t them to re&s;erve in the country corn enough of EVERY kind to enable others to exert their benevolence to their poorer neigh|bors; not by gratu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tous donations, but by &s;elling it at rea&s;onable prices to tho&s;e who are in want; we do not a&s;k it from the farmers at the prices of good times. GOD forbid that we &s;hould deny them FAIR profits, &s;uch as every other dealer has a right to. I wi&s;h to inculcate univer&s;al ju&s;tice; but let us remember that CHARITY begins at home. We &s;hall gladly impart our &s;uper|fluity to our mo&s;t di&s;tant neighbors, even &s;hould we be obliged to pay more for the bare competency we may re&s;erve.</P>
