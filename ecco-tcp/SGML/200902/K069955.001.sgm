But when, according to the &s;tricte&s;t law, not &s;imply of poetical or human, but of divine ju&s;tice, tho&s;e
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader is intreated to pardon the liberty here taken with the &s;acred words of Shak&s;peare, in order to render them more applicable.</NOTE> "Bloody in&s;truments which he taught</L>

<L>"And even-handed Ju&s;tice has commended</L>
<L>"The ingredients of his poi&s;on'd chalice to <HI>his own lips;"</HI></L></Q>
And, when in the fall of that <HI>Hero of Enor|mity,</HI> wherein all his petty in&s;truments were involved&mdash;when, by the bounty of Provi|dence &s;hewn in the &s;alvation of his "taking off," the human race was, in a manner, <HI>again
<PB N="ix" REF="5">redeemed</HI> from the utter de&s;truction his in&s;a|tiate appetite for the blood of man had com|plotted; in &s;hort, when the death of this ty|rant proved the re&s;urrection of humanity, the degree of cen&s;ure mu&s;t dimini&s;h in propor|tion to the diminution of offences.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;uppo&s;e there exi&s;ted a man in Great-Britain, however warmly his affections might glow, and his heart beat in her cau&s;e, who thought that the dete&s;ted &s;y&s;tem of tho&s;e tyrants above-mentioned has not been meliorated by tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were, indeed, the meliorators; and, though there yet remains much to be done, ere a man, who duly poi&s;es civil and political good and evil, &s;hall dare to a&s;&s;ert all that was wrong is done away, it would be as palpable an ab&s;urdity to confound their for|mer with their pre&s;ent conduct, as to com|pare utter darkne&s;s with the manife&s;t rays of returning light.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="6">While the French people were the mo&s;t flagitious among&s;t exi&s;ting mortals, the Gleaner reprobated them as &s;uch; and he wi&s;hes that reprobation may &s;erve the double purpo&s;e of <HI>record and example.</HI> Now that their &s;y&s;tem is reformed, in many of its wor&s;t abu&s;es, he is as earne&s;t to congratu|late, as he had been to condemn. And he dares aver, that every con&s;iderate man in England&mdash;nay more, every con&s;iderate man, who, in loyalty or terror, had &s;ollicited the protection of any <HI>other</HI> country, feels, that the di&s;tinction here made is warranted.</P>
<P>He cannot, in any one feature, &s;often the portrait drawn of the horrors which, to the point of time he held the pencil, deformed a devoted land. Neither can he, with feel|ings that would &s;atisfy his own heart, omit the opportunity of &s;oftening many of the &s;hades, and of expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h, intere&s;ting to every fibre of that heart, and he tru&s;ts of a
<PB N="xi" REF="7">million more, that the picture not only of the bleeding land alluded to, but of every other, over which the &s;word of de&s;olation is yet drawn, may &s;oon exhibit, in the be&s;t light that PEACE WHICH IS MORE GLORI|OUS THAN VICTORY.</P>
<P>The greater part, however, of the&s;e Gleanings, being written on le&s;s local, and, of cour&s;e, more comfortable, becau&s;e more humane &s;ubjects&mdash;the beauties of nature and of art&mdash;will lo&s;e nothing of their intere&s;t, by being thus "mixed with ba&s;er matter;" for &s;uch war mu&s;t ever be con&s;idered, whether flu&s;hed with conque&s;t, or humbled by defeat. The <HI>utility,</HI> indeed, of &s;uch ob&s;ervations, as are de&s;igned to
<Q>"Guide the traveller on <HI>his way,"</HI></Q> and a&s;&s;i&s;t him, in the article of expence, &amp;c. &amp;c. mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be <HI>practically</HI> &s;u&s;|pended, till
<Q>"Grim-vi&s;ag'd War has &s;mooth'd his wrinkled front."</Q>
<PB N="xii" REF="8">For, while every path abroad is clogged with blood, it is to be pre&s;umed that few, even of tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to quarrel with their country, will, uncalled by duty, for&s;ake that happy land, in who&s;e bo&s;om, amid&s;t all their di&s;content, they &s;till find a SECURE AND PEACEFUL HOME.</P>
<P>On a return to that <HI>peaceful home,</HI> after looking for &s;o long a time on its turbulent contra&s;t in other lands, the Gleaner he&s;itates not to confe&s;s, that he felt all the ardour of a Briton, and, amid&s;t the laudable enthu|&s;ia&s;m of that character, woo'd once more the Mu&s;e of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sympathy, a poem.</NOTE> Sympathy, to pay her hone&s;t tribute to the country, which, in compari&s;on of others, he found, literally, what that Mu&s;e had called it,
<Q>Th' a&s;ylum of the &s;uffering earth.</Q></P>
<P>With the &s;acred effu&s;ions then, that, on this conviction, flowed from his grateful heart, he
<PB N="xiii" REF="9">&s;hall open his GLEANINGS&mdash;in the cour&s;e of which he flatters him&s;elf, no narrow prejudices of any kind will be found. On the contrary, prejudices will be &s;trongly combated, whether the growth of his own, or any other country.</P>

<PB N="xxxiv" REF="27">will in due order appear: the contra&s;t was powerful enough for him, or for any man &s;o circum&s;tanced, to have ble&s;t the Briti&s;h &s;hore, honoured the Briti&s;h King, and venerated the Briti&s;h government, had he <HI>not</HI> been born under their au&s;pices, had he even been their <HI>foe!</HI></P>
<P>For the rever&s;e of this picture then, he looked <HI>at home.</HI> In the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t vigorous preparations for war, he felt him&s;elf in the bo&s;om of peace. The &s;ailors were &s;inging, and as it were, fitting out for victory, on the rigging, regulating the top, or guarding the bottom of their ve&s;&s;els. The &s;oldiers were merry in garri&s;on, or &s;miling on their po&s;t. The huzza of <HI>God &s;ave the King,</HI> re-echoed to the waves! French po|litics were &s;couted, and good old Engli&s;h max|ims were recited with hereditary veneration. If even at <HI>that</HI> hour, trea&s;on prophaned the realm, it was con&s;cious of no le&s;s &s;hame
<PB N="xxxv" REF="28">than weakne&s;s, and like other unclean and ravenous bea&s;ts, it &s;hunned the day. If ever the voice of loyalty was general, it then re|&s;ounded thro' comparatively the happie&s;t land. The contra&s;t empowered the Gleaner to feel it in all its force. In pa&s;&s;ing a little high|road village he &s;aw a train of children of both &s;exes, not forced into the &s;ervice of the Convention, at that time a new <HI>Council of Blood,</HI> not carrying in their feeble hands the mangled heads or limbs, of the brother or &s;i&s;ter infants, on whom <HI>they had elaborated a murder;</HI> but a little battalion of boys and girls of Briti&s;h growth, who, catching the &s;pirit of the times, and of the country, formed them&s;elves into <HI>volunteer</HI> bodies, and employed their &s;canty allowance of play hours in a kind of <HI>military</HI> nur&s;ery. Their pocket-money went to purcha&s;e drums, whi&s;tles, wooden &s;words, &s;pears, guns, and other in&s;truments of mimic war. A pair
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="29">of colours &s;eemed to have been bought at the price of a flowered Sabbath-day &s;lip, and Sunday wai&s;tcoat, and a &s;mart martial looking lad, of about ten years of age, was the commanding officer.</P>
<P>Gue&s;s, reader, the nature of the Gleaner's &s;en&s;ations. Con&s;ider the countries he had left, and that to which he returned, and when you are better acquainted with his u&s;ual habits, you will not wonder he forgot, that he had farther to go, and in the warmth of the welcome oblivion, which, though it lo&s;t him a place in the coach, was no deduction to his plea&s;ure, he followed the little troop round the town like a new recruit. When it came to a &s;top, the youth who commanded, made a &s;peech which was a mor&s;el of mo&s;t exemplary loyalty indeed; for it ble&s;&s;ed the king, and then ble&s;&s;ed God, for ble&s;&s;ing the king, at the end of every &s;entence. Though they
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="30">were by no means mercenaries, they &s;olli|cited a little help from the company around, ju&s;t to an&s;wer military exigences. The &s;mall corporal pre&s;ented his cap, to which all the birds of air appeared to have right loyally contributed a feather. The Gleaner's mite was not withheld. Indeed, he was heated enough to have actually en|li&s;ted, had they invited him to join the corps. He left them with reluctance, after they di&s;banded for the night, which he pa&s;s'd at a little public hou&s;e in the village. Here he met with an hone&s;t, kind hearted, &s;lip&s;lop of a landlady, a love&s;ick, pale-faced maiden, who &s;aid <HI>&s;he</HI> hated polities, and a landlord, who &s;aid <HI>he</HI> was a profound politician. He had amu&s;ement, at the moment, in <HI>Glean|ing</HI> them, but as their counterparts are to be &s;een in almo&s;t every public hou&s;e,</P>
<L>"Where news much older than their ale, goes round."</L>
<P>He &s;hall wi&s;h them to be as well as they are
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="31">harmle&s;s, and pa&s;s on. He had intended to revi&s;it London. Some unexpected events determined him to another route, and re|&s;olving to remain in the track of foreign intelligence, he repaired to a place, whither two motives guided him: Fir&s;t, its being a &s;mall &s;pot, near a great pa&s;&s;age-town; and, &s;econdly, in a part of England, he had never vi&s;ited. Having time to &s;pare, and a di&s;po|&s;ition to <HI>Glean,</HI> you &s;hall judge of his &s;a|tisfactions. He will endeavour to make you think you are a &s;pectator of a <HI>day's Gleaning in his native land.</HI> He began to compare all he had viewed in other places, with the &s;weetly varied &s;pots before him, not &s;o much with re&s;pect to their beauty as their &s;ecure tran|quillity. With regard to the &s;urrounding re&s;idents, he was among&s;t &s;trangers, but they were human beings, and his countrymen; or they were happy dome&s;tic creatures, un|der the protection of an ea&s;y government. He knew no one: yet by a certain magic
<PB N="xxxix" REF="32">that works in the heart of every philan|thropi&s;t, and without meriting that charac|ter, he fears, no man can be a patriot, he &s;eemed to be intere&s;ted about every body: and all the objects which his eyes could reach, his heart &s;eemed to embrace. It appeared, on this &s;ingular occa&s;ion, as if he had met with a large part of his own family, whom he had never before encountered: and com|ing from foreign lands, where anarchy and ruin had taken up their dwelling, his heart bounded to behold all tho&s;e who were at length brought &s;o clo&s;e to him, in the fulle&s;t enjoyment of their lives and properties. In other countries, he had often &s;een the hired &s;ervants, the pea&s;ant, and farmers, imperiou&s;ly ordered to leave their own, or their ma&s;ter's affairs, and labour in the plea&s;ure grounds, or palace of &s;ome petty prince, who&s;e whole principality, &s;ometimes does not mea&s;ure to the acres of a good Engli&s;h domain. But in England, the &s;eed, which the hu&s;bandman
<PB N="xl" REF="33">had &s;own, he was preparing to reap, nor is it in the wi&s;h, or the <HI>power,</HI> of a monarch to plunder him of a moment. His toil is his <HI>own,</HI> &s;o are the fruits of it. And while he is getting in the copious harve&s;t, the expec|tations and efforts of the year are, in many other parts of the globe, &s;eized on by lawle&s;s hands, or clotted by gore to prevent it. The carol of the <HI>law-defended &s;ubject,</HI> touched all the chords of the Gleaner's heart; the birds that flew over his head, &s;eemed le&s;s independ|ent, and to have le&s;s of "perfect freedom." A party of haymakers, were at the moment, following the la&s;t well-heaped load, or &s;port|ing on its top, their rakes wreathed with tri|umphant garlands, while a fea&s;t, in the open air, and within view of the fini&s;hed hay&s;tacks, awaited them. Every &s;yllable in the deli|cious de&s;cription <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Now &s;warms the village o'er the jovial mead," &amp;c.</NOTE> of the Briti&s;h Maro, was illu&s;trated.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="34">How different is the jovial &s;cenery in the poet's de&s;cription, from the inhuman yell of <HI>Ca Ira,</HI> in the accur&s;ed times of Rober|&s;pierre, for then was his horrible power in force! oppo&s;ite, even as the &s;ong of rural in|nocence, and the di&s;&s;onant roar of guilt and rapine overrunning the fields! It was a plea|&s;ant, an intere&s;ting &s;ight; it warmed the bo&s;om of the Gleaner to its inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es; he was in humour with every thing; the comfort-looking huts, the ample downs, the &s;heep that fed upon them, the &s;oft and peace|ful-&s;eeming inclo&s;ures, the &s;tretches of wood, water, and garden-grounds, the captivating inter&s;per&s;ed villas, the aweful man&s;ions, and good old halls of ho&s;pitality, the very cluck of the Engli&s;h hou&s;ehold fowl, and the dome&s;tic rookery. He &s;poke to every labourer with the voice of a countryman and friend. The charm was, indeed, heightened by a vi&s;it to the Engli&s;h cottages; the appearance of the &s;turdy &s;wains and blooming dam&s;els, who
<PB N="xlii" REF="35">inhabited them&mdash;&s;o utterly different, in air, dre&s;s, complexion, &s;hapes and language, from the pea&s;antry he had quitted.</P>
<P>Such is the journal of a flowery day's &s;en|&s;ations, in returning to the land, who&s;e &s;cenery, places, and per&s;ons, by a &s;ort of indefinable attachment, not only appears to belong to us, but of which one &s;eems to be a <HI>part.</HI> Perhaps they were not the le&s;s agreeable to the Gleaner for the pains that afflicted his feelings in other countries. How he wandered over, gazed on, and lingered in the &s;cene! He had fled from a repining and oppre&s;&s;ed people, oppre&s;&s;ed beyond any power of re|lief, and took &s;anctuary with the peaceful and contented. All &s;eemed natal. The trees that &s;haded, the &s;un that warmed, the earth that received him, and the air he breathed!</P>
<P>And are there tho&s;e who would reduce all <HI>this</HI> into a wilderne&s;s? Ye Britons, be
<PB N="xliii" REF="36">not deluded into mi&s;ery! Even that, which may be a good cau&s;e to one nation may be a bad one to another.</P>
<Q><L>"Think, O think,</L>
<L>"How good the God of Harve&s;t is to you!</L>
<L>"Who pours abundance o'er your flowing fields!</L></Q>
<P>Had the mo&s;t clamorous, the mo&s;t di&s;|contented, half the opportunities of the Gleaner, they would, even with all its errors, think England the happie&s;t country, and them&s;elves the happie&s;t people now on the face of the globe. As to <HI>faults,</HI> he can only repeat the wi&s;h he has earne&s;tly breathed in the Ode, that they may be
<Q>"NOBLY reformed."</Q></P>
<P>The Gleaner could have wi&s;hed, however, to have found the benevolence of the country, celebrated in the Ode, more <HI>uniform;</HI> and that, while it was holding out the hand of
<PB N="xliv" REF="37">ho&s;pitality to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>aliens,</HI> who had been driven from their homes, that it had cea&s;ed to inflict tyranny and &s;lavery on a yet more numerous body of unfortunates. He grieved to ob&s;erve, even on his &s;econd return, an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Slave Trade.</NOTE> evil which, long before his &s;etting out, was deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with the mild, humane, and, generally &s;peaking, whole&s;ome prin|ciples of the Briti&s;h Government, and which he had heard di&s;cu&s;&s;ed on the Continent with every mark of wonder and reprobation. It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to &s;pecify, that he al|ludes to the immitigable <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> of more than half of the inhabitants of the globe, merely becau&s;e they differ from their <HI>per&s;e|cutors</HI> in complexion.</P>
<P>And yet we rank our&s;elves among&s;t the generous lovers of freedom, and have bled in her &s;acred cau&s;e at every pore. It is &s;ome|what humiliating, however, that the very men we are fighting on the ground of im|puted
<PB N="xlv" REF="38"><HI>barbarity,</HI> and con&s;idering too we have &s;o long debated the &s;ubject in the great a&s;|&s;embly of the nation&mdash;to find that this <HI>&s;a|vage foe,</HI> again&s;t who&s;e ferocity we have rai&s;ed the arm, &s;hould have <HI>done</HI> that gene|rous act in a &s;ingle day, which Britons have been &s;o many years <HI>talking</HI> about. It cannot be denied that the French people have got the &s;tart of us in giving real freedom to that unhappy race of beings, who, though they have unque&s;tionably all the rights of men, are treated as bea&s;ts of the fields, without <HI>any rights at all;</HI> nay, as condemned cri|minals, who have, by the pro&s;oription of crimes, forfeited not only <HI>tho&s;e</HI> rights, but every kindred claim that attaches to <HI>&s;pecies</HI> or even &s;prings from common charity. The Gleaner certainly has been among&s;t the fir&s;t, as will appear on the face of the&s;e Gleanings, to reprobate &s;uch parts of the French mea|&s;ures as ju&s;tice, no le&s;s than philanthropy, mu&s;t reject; but he was one of the fir&s;t to
<PB N="xlvi" REF="39"><HI>honour</HI> them for this part of their conduct. Their plan of Equality <HI>there</HI> was great, glo|rious, and exemplary; and even if it was but intended as a &s;troke of policy, it ought, like Abraham's faith, to be imputed to them as righteou&s;ne&s;s. Strenuou&s;ly has the Gleaner in&s;i&s;ted, and will in&s;i&s;t for ever, becau&s;e on the ground of eternal truth, that,
<Q><L>"THE RIGHTS OF MAN BY NATURE STILL ARE DUE</L>
<L>"TO MEN OF EVERY CLIME, AND EVERY HUE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Humanity, book ii.</NOTE>."</L></Q></P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive, indeed, how the &s;ons of avarice can bring their feeble argu|ments to carry any weight, when, in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, are to be placed all the mo|tives of common hone&s;ty, and every prin|ciple of ju&s;tice, and of rea&s;on. And yet, on coming home, the author of the Poem above|quoted, heard the &s;ame unwarrantable, un|feeling, and &s;ordid arguments for <HI>continuing</HI> this iniquitous tyranny, that had been pol|luting
<PB N="xlvii" REF="40">the <HI>public humanity of the country</HI> &s;o many years. Nay, the truly worthy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wilberforce.</NOTE> mover of the Bill for doing away this enormity, has, it &s;eems, been <HI>harra&s;&s;ed out</HI> with the perpetual checks his benevolent plan received. It has been put off from time to time, till, mo&s;t probably, it will totally die away. And all this in de&s;pite of the mo&s;t liberal &s;upport from men of <HI>all</HI> parties, led on by Pitt, Fox, Sheridan, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No wonder then, that the Lyre has failed to effect what the be&s;t and brighte&s;t Powers of the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;eem to have re|linqui&s;hed <HI>in de&s;pair.</HI> As a la&s;t effort, how|ever, the Gleaner will place his mite once again in the <HI>way</HI> of being &s;een by &s;ome of the advocates of this <HI>unble&s;&s;ed, unchri&s;tian trade;</HI> and &s;hould but <HI>one</HI> purcha&s;er, or &s;ale&s;|man of his &s;pecies, be moved to pity and re|dre&s;s the wrongs of one en&s;laved fellow-crea|ture, he will triumph in having put an end
<PB N="xlviii" REF="41">to the captivity of that one; or, if a nig|gard ta&s;k-ma&s;ter &s;till holds him in bonds, deaf to the voice of nature and con&s;cience, the attempt will have been made, and both con&s;cience and nature &s;hall unite to &s;ooth the di&s;appointment. Bitter, already, has been that di&s;appointment; for he who prai&s;ed the BE|NEVOLENCE of Albion had hoped &s;he would have extended that freedom, which &s;he loves, and which is the ba&s;is of her happine&s;s, be|yond the narrow circle of <HI>her own land;</HI> but, as that is not the ca&s;e, it &s;eems a duty im|po&s;ed by compa&s;&s;ion and ju&s;tice on every man, to awaken the public mind, &s;o far as in him lies, to a &s;en&s;e of what it owes to this important &s;ubject. For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, in&s;tead of republi&s;hing the arguments which have been offered on this topic by the Gleaner, in a &s;eparate form, a new impre&s;&s;ion being called for, tho&s;e arguments &s;hall be pre|&s;ented at the end of the&s;e volumes: &s;o &s;hall the &s;heaves be crowned with a wreathe of HUMANITY.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="42">The introductory parts to our &s;heaves hav|ing hitherto been employed in home-felt &s;ubjects, there will be a &s;ort of propriety in clo&s;ing therewith. On which idea, our pre|liminary matter &s;hall conclude with a Glean|ing of the Engli&s;h Stage, which &s;eems, like many other things, to have undergone a revolutionary &s;hock; and, like &s;ome others, we will not <HI>now</HI> &s;ay <HI>all,</HI> to be by no means the better for it.</P>

IN regard to the <HI>Gleanings</HI> them&s;elves, now to pa&s;s from the clo&s;et of an indulgent circle of private friends, to the public, I have, by the nature and licence of the epi&s;tolary form of writing, been led to &s;ay &s;o much in the fir&s;t per&s;on, that, in &s;o &s;educing a part of &s;peech, I will not tru&s;t my&s;elf to enlarge in this general Introduction; but conclude, with quoting a pa&s;&s;age in the account which has been given in one of the monthly pub|lications, of a "Journey," nearly in the track of the Gleaner, by the author of "the My&s;teries of Udolpho," and &s;everal other very beautiful compo&s;itions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. TO THE HONOURABLE MRS. B.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>South Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I mentioned to a learned and elegant friend my de&s;ign to pa&s;s &s;ome years on the Continent, he cordially took my hand, and thus addre&s;&s;ed me:</P>
<P><Q>You are going to travel: travelling, like love, makes authors; authors make books: men, women, and children, publi&s;h at home, what they have &s;een or heard abroad;&mdash;Ergo, were not you already an author, it would be expected of you to <HI>write a book.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To travel then, and to publi&s;h; are become things of cour&s;e, &s;aid I? <Q>As much &s;o, re|joined my friend, as cau&s;e and effect.</Q> It would be difficult, however, I pre&s;ume, to prove that though they may be equally in order, they are equal in value; for, to multiply <HI>copies of copies of copies,</HI> is &s;urely, adding to the bulk of
<PB N="2" REF="63">an evil that <Q>has increa&s;ed, is &s;till increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimini&s;hed:</Q> I admit your ob&s;ervation, proceeded I, that every body pub|li&s;hes travels, but am in doubt about the u&s;e of the inference; for, if people who leave their own country <HI>predetermined</HI> to make a book out of what they meet with, what they &s;ee, or &s;eem to &s;ee, in others, it either is an argument again&s;t the farther over&s;tock of the literary market, or a proof po&s;itive that the innumerable <HI>travelling bookmakers,</HI> who have "beat the beaten road" the&s;e thou&s;and years, have told us nothing we did not know better before; and, hereupon, a pretty curious que&s;tion ari&s;es: How far tho&s;e who have undertaken to conduct our per&s;ons and pur&s;es through countries, remote or near, have proved them&s;elves true or fal&s;e guides? how far readers who have taken abroad with them &s;uch publications as the Vade Mecums of their re&s;pective tours, have found them&s;elves more or le&s;s perplexed and mi&s;led, than if they had been left to their own ignorance, and to the experience which, however dearly, perhaps more truly, corrects it?</P>
<P><Q>You think then, re&s;umed my friend, that an an&s;wer to the&s;e interrogations would de|termine the propriety of giving, or refu&s;ing to give, another book of travels to tho&s;e al|ready
<PB N="3" REF="64">publi&s;hed: You imagine that a new edition every ten years of the fir&s;t and only original work, marking the fre&s;h modes by way of addenda, would preclude, and render u&s;ele&s;s, all the labours of imitative tra|vellers?</Q></P>
<P>I told him, this would be, perhaps, going too far, but that were the replies to be made by tho&s;e admirable critics the eye and the pocket, we &s;hould <HI>"&s;ee feelingly"</HI> that our knowledge by no means increa&s;es in proportion to the num|ber of our books on the &s;ame &s;ubject.
<Q>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, interpos'd he, that the regions, not of fact, only, but, of fairy land, have been <HI>over-run with travellers:</HI> Every thing, therefore, of either u&s;e, or ornament, might be &s;uppo&s;ed, at this time of day, to
<L>"Live in de&s;cription and look green in &s;ong."</L>
but, the truth is, that much is always left to be found by him who is diligent to &s;eek, and that, of the innumerable travellers who have gone the <HI>&s;ame</HI> roads there are few who have not added <HI>&s;omething</HI> to our &s;tock of in|formation, or amu&s;ement: and, moreover, that every per&s;on of talents <HI>is, in reality, origi|nal,</HI> either in the matter or manner of exerting them; no two people, even of equal abilities,
<PB N="4" REF="65">(employing them on the &s;ame occa&s;ion) &s;ee|ing or feeling the very &s;ame objects, or occur|rences, in the &s;ame way; &s;o that there mu&s;t be, I &s;ay, a degree of novelty in every work not &s;ervilely purloined from what the plagiary had neither candour to avow, nor ingenuity to improve. But, even granting that the greater crop of general ob&s;ervation, has been gathered by others who have made their in|tellectual harve&s;t abroad, and brought it home, <HI>pro bono publico,</HI> let me remind you, by the help of an allu&s;ion borrowed from hu&s;bandry, that the vigilance of the farmer has never yet been able to clear the ground of its produce, &s;o as to leave nothing where|with to reward the indu&s;trious <HI>gleaner:</HI> Some ears of the valuable grain e&s;cape the jealous rake even of avarice it&s;elf, and where the fields are &s;pacious, there mu&s;t always be &s;ome|thing worth &s;tooping for, even where the la|bourers are many.</Q></P>
<P>Plea&s;ed and encouraged by this mode of rea|&s;oning; I exclaimed, Be it &s;o then: another <HI>Book of Travels &s;hall be written,</HI> and, to &s;hew my gratitude for the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation, the work &s;hall owe its title to an idea that is this moment &s;ugge&s;ted by the agricultural images you have &s;o agreeably played with. I will call my book
<PB N="5" REF="66">that is to be, GLEANINGS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> gathering up whatever may be left to humble indu&s;try, or excur&s;ive curio&s;ity, in the path of my wander|ings,&mdash;now and then deviating into the fields of fancy, mixing thus my <HI>wheat</HI> with &s;uch <HI>flowers</HI> as grow in its neighbourhood, whether in hedge rows or gardens, whether the pro|ductions of art or nature.
<Q>Good! cried my friend, rubbing his hands together, and at length you &s;hall bind your collected glean|ings into &s;heaves&mdash;that is, volumes&mdash;and pre&s;ent them, neat as imported from the foreign markets, to your <HI>friends and enemies.</HI> To both of whom, added he &s;milingly, and with a bri&s;ker friction of his hands, they will &s;upply food of a different kind, the one ban|quetting on whatever you &s;et before them with hearty good-will, the other &s;atiating on the be&s;t you can offer, with as hearty malice. Be&s;ides, continued he, you will thus furni&s;h a fea&s;t to your&s;elf, and be entertained while you entertain. <HI>I will have it &s;o</HI>&mdash;Farewell: Be &s;ure you write a book, and do not return to me till you can come volume in hand.</Q></P>
<P>He departed, without &s;uffering me to &s;ay more, a&s;&s;erting that the be&s;t proof of my regard for him would be given in my adoption of his councils.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="67">The councils were whole&s;ome, and I &s;hall fol|low them: Before my leaving London it was &s;ettled, at another conver&s;ation, with the &s;ame friend, that my <HI>Gleanings</HI> were to be di&s;pen&s;ed by parcels to <HI>him,</HI> that he was to put them into the granary&mdash;that is his library&mdash;till their bulk increa&s;ed &s;ufficiently to be of public u&s;e, and not a month was to pa&s;s without a &s;mall <HI>&s;heaf</HI> being &s;ent to him. Alas! it was decreed that ere the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> month was expired this amiable coun&s;ellor and friend &s;hould go
<Q><L>"To that bourne from whence <HI>no traveller</HI> returns."!</L>
<L>"Still drops from life &s;ome withering joy away."</L> (&s;aith our celebrated John&s;on.) The impre&s;&s;ion made upon me by his death, would, perhaps, have induced me to give up an idea, which could not be pur&s;ued without a &s;entiment of re|gret for the lo&s;s of him who in&s;pired it, had I not reflected that there exi&s;ted &s;till <HI>another,</HI> who&s;e mind, no le&s;s than my own, required amu&s;ement; and, at length, to conclude, that the be&s;t mode of te&s;tifying my e&s;teem and ve|neration for the decea&s;ed would be to fulfil <HI>his</HI> wi&s;hes; even while I fulfilled yours, my dear &s;urviving comfort, at the &s;ame time.</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e ends, I now addre&s;s to <HI>you,</HI> from the mo&s;t beautiful part of the Briti&s;h Empire (&mdash;for
<PB N="7" REF="68">&s;uch I think we may fairly call the principality of the ancient Britons&mdash;) the fir&s;t offerings of my Gleanings. An humble employment, per|haps!&mdash;to collect ear by ear, as it were, the <HI>re|fu&s;e</HI> of what others have either <HI>overlooked or ne|glected:</HI> but if, out of this lowly occupation, you and I, my excellent friend, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and my readers, in the &s;econd, when the corn is gathered into &s;heaves, and bound up, &s;hould be able to make that bread which &s;trengtheneth the heart, or pre&s;s from the &s;canty vintage that wine of life, which exhilarates, and gives a cheerful countenance in the drooping moment: &mdash;if it affords the tran&s;ient &s;weets of a foreign &s;hore, when the flowers at home are withered or de&s;poiled, I &s;hall not have &s;tooped in vain.</P>
<P>Adieu, my friend! Our convention is &s;ettled, and you &s;hall &s;oon hear from me again.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>South Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS it behoves a <HI>Gleaner</HI> to be diligent, deliberate, and not hurry over his ground like tho&s;e who come to a <HI>full crop,</HI> and whom abundance makes carele&s;s, I have re&s;olved, not only for your &s;ake, but my own, to &s;tay always &s;ome days, frequently &s;ome weeks, and not &s;el|dom &s;ome months in every town, city, or village, from whence I &s;hall write. A rule which in|verts the general one. In&s;tead of adding to the long li&s;t of <HI>po&s;t-ha&s;te travellers,</HI> I am deter|mined to perform my journies at a foot-pace rather than a full gallop, convinced, from a deal of experience, that, although <Q>he who runs may read,</Q> he who <HI>rides, as it were ex|pre&s;s, through a country,</HI> cannot write any thing worth the attention even of a <HI>running reader</HI>&mdash;At lea&s;t, it becomes a que&s;tion worth an&s;wering, whether the deliberate mode is not more likely to di&s;cover and de&s;cribe what merits communication, than the helter-&s;kelter fa&s;hion of writing on the &s;pur, whip, and wheel, our accounts of people and places? I am of opinion it is; and I have the &s;upport of good old peo|ple,
<PB N="9" REF="70">and good old proverbs in Latin and Eng|li&s;h. "<HI>Fe&s;tine lente,"</HI> &s;ays the one&mdash; <Q><HI>He &s;tumbles who goes fa&s;t,</HI></Q> echoes the other. To believe, therefore, that He who "<HI>moves &s;low, moves &s;ure,"</HI> is a rea&s;onable conclu&s;ion. In|deed, I have wondered, that &s;o very few of my emigrating countrymen have been of this way of thinking. On the contrary, they hurry through the de&s;tined cour&s;e as if they were run|ning a race again&s;t time, and were to perform &s;uch a given portion of it, within the hour by a &s;top watch.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plea&s;antly <HI>fanciful</HI> at lea&s;t, of all modern travellers, in his inimitable "journey," has given us, in his own &s;portive manner, a catalogue of travellers, with the epithets proper to, and characteri&s;tic of, each, &s;uch as the &s;enti|mental, political, idle, diligent, <HI>et caetera;</HI> but he has not, to my recollection, &s;aid any thing about the <HI>deliberate,</HI> or more correctly &s;peak|ing, the <HI>re&s;identiary</HI> traveller, who &s;ets out on a plan of &s;ojourning in the parts of the world he de&s;cribes, and mixes in the &s;ocieties of each long enough to ob&s;erve <HI>accurately</HI> manners, cu&s;toms, and events. The infinitely diver&s;ified modes of the&s;e, mu&s;t be overlooked, &s;een very partially, or not &s;een at all, by the modern <HI>Mercuries</HI> who go at full &s;peed to the grand
<PB N="10" REF="71">point of their de&s;tination&mdash;&s;ome of the capitals &mdash;and &s;carce give time for the hor&s;es to be changed at the intermediate &s;tages: or, if they are under the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to &s;tay a night at any of the&s;e, the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive of them &s;troll thro' the &s;treets, or &s;aunter round the ramparts, <HI>while the &s;upper is preparing;</HI> the re&s;t throw them|&s;elves on chairs and &s;ophas till arous'd by the return of their companions, who generally come back di&s;&s;atisfied with their ramble, and, if they write at all, &s;it down betwixt &s;leeping and waking, and in&s;ert, in the meagre journal of the day, a drow&s;y, yet &s;plenetic, account of what they met with in their walk; depending on the &s;exton as the hi&s;torian of the buildings, and on &s;ome chance pa&s;&s;enger as the intelligencer of the inhabitants, environs, police, &amp;c. &amp;c. At day break the next morning they are off, &s;carce al|lowing time for &s;wallowing a comfortle&s;s di&s;h of coffee, &s;quabbling with their ho&s;t for extor|tion, cur&s;ing the country they are under the im|mediate protection of, and di&s;gracing the man|ners of their own. This done, they continue their expedition <HI>as upon life and death,</HI> and often, &mdash;alas, how much too often! fini&s;h their folly, their fortune, and their tour, at the &s;ame time: for it is not till after their return to their native country that the&s;e <HI>da&s;hing travellers</HI> di&s;cover, that their mo&s;t precious things&mdash;time, money,
<PB N="11" REF="72">and talents&mdash;have been wa&s;ted to receive only contempt, fatigue, and vexation in return&mdash;a &s;ad barter.</P>
<P>But not to circum&s;cribe the inutility of <HI>rapid</HI> travelling to the&s;e cyphers of &s;ociety, who in all countries are in&s;ignificant, the remark, I fear, and the cen&s;ure, involves, in &s;ome degree, per|&s;ons of a different de&s;cription; in as far as the cu&s;tomary method of <HI>writing po&s;t,</HI> on the policy, and practice of nations, mu&s;t be injuri|ous to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable abilities, which can|not intuitively know occurrences, characters, and u&s;ages, that ari&s;e out of <HI>time, place, and cir|cum&s;tance;</HI> and cannot (except to a lucky tra|veller indeed, and to him very occa&s;ionally) happen, while arrangements are making for the accommodation of man and hor&s;e between &s;tage and &s;tage; and when all one can expect to &s;ee are the mo&s;t &s;light and ordinary objects that float, like weeds and offal on the &s;tream, on the &s;urface of the places through which we pa&s;s. Neither is the human mind, whatever be its powers, well di&s;po&s;ed to paint &s;cenes and inci|dents when the body is worn down by the day's travel, and the &s;pirits jaded by the fatigue of motion: yet, if we look at the dating of our modern travels, the avowed objects of which are cu&s;toms and manners, we &s;hall find that mo&s;t of
<PB N="12" REF="73">the ob&s;ervations are the productions of <HI>the mo|ment,</HI> written amid&s;t the du&s;t and hurry of go|ing from the &s;pot de&s;cribed to another, which is, in due time, to be di&s;patched in the &s;ame way. Is it therefore to be wondered at, if we fre|quently find the common effects of an over ha&s;ty judgment&mdash;mi&s;tated facts, and fal&s;e in|ferences.</P>
<P>All the&s;e convictions have &s;trengthened me in the re&s;olution of being a <HI>re&s;identiary</HI> traveller, making a re&s;t in every country which I de&s;ign to <HI>glean.</HI> This, you will &s;ay, my dear friend, is in character, but I &s;cruple not to a&s;&s;ert, on an experience which I hope to make you partaker of, that tour-makers of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, and re&s;pectability, have left many things unnoticed highly worthy their and the public ob&s;ervation, and which could not have e&s;caped, had they &s;uffered their patience to keep pace with their penetration.</P>
<P>The illu&s;tration of this I tru&s;t you will ga|ther as we go along.</P>
<P>The &s;cenery of <HI>Nature,</HI> in a &s;ummer dre&s;s, is a volume open to every eye, and a copious page may be read at a glance: The mo&s;t nimble traveller might luxuriate as he runs by them, and his land&s;cape, though but the etch|ing
<PB N="13" REF="74">of an in&s;tant of time, mu&s;t, if he has &s;kill to "catch the objects as they ri&s;e," and rich|ne&s;s of genius to tint them, be various and delightful. Here, the border of Breck|nock&s;hire, which begins, ju&s;t where what is <HI>now</HI> called England owns its boundary, I was enchanted with the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> view, but di&s;co|vered at a &s;econd, third, fourth, onward to a fortieth, in various excur&s;ions to and fro, during a &s;ix months' re&s;idence, a thou&s;and and ten thou&s;and particular charms which a fir&s;t ge|neral &s;urvey could never afford. I devoted an equal proportion of time to the northern as to the &s;outhern divi&s;ion, of this paradi&s;aical prin|cipality, going to the extreme verge both ways, and traver&s;ing backwards and forwards to look at their beauties in different &s;ea&s;ons of the year; and it is the re&s;ult of the&s;e repeated vi&s;its, which, at the pre&s;ent moment, I give you: I give it you, in the grateful warmth of my heart, for plea&s;ure received, not without an earne&s;t hope, at the &s;ame time, that you, and others who have ta&s;te and affections to reli&s;h the blooms of na|ture, and patrioti&s;m enough to admire them not the wor&s;e for appertaining to their <HI>natal i&s;land,</HI> may be tempted to enjoy the &s;ame &s;cenery.</P>
<P>That Wales hath a claim to pre-eminence on the &s;core of romantic beauty, can only be
<PB N="14" REF="75">doubted by tho&s;e who never have traver&s;ed it, or who, traver&s;ing, rather run a race than make a regular tour. It is certain, that &s;everal detached &s;pots, in &s;everal different Engli&s;h counties, ex|hibit to the eye of the traveller as much of &s;im|plicity, here and there, as much of the &s;ublime, and frequently more of cultivation; but then tho&s;e are to be con&s;idered as pickt and cho&s;en places, and are, therefore, particular: whereas, the natural graces of Wales, the &s;pontaneous fragrance of the wild herbs and flowers, the un|re&s;trained redundance of the foliage, and the unlaboured fertility of the &s;outhern &s;oil, are general. They often expand from one &s;hire to another with &s;ucce&s;&s;ions both of the beauti|ful and &s;ublime, &s;ometimes to the &s;tretch of thirty or forty miles, in the progre&s;s of which the fancy and the heart, the under&s;tanding, and all the higher emotions of the &s;oul are, by turns, regaled and delighted. Hence it is impo&s;&s;ible for a traveller of a ju&s;t ta&s;te not to catch plea&s;ure and in&s;truction from that endle&s;s va|riety of land and water, hill and valley, dizzy a&s;cent, and apparently fathomle&s;s precipice, which, in Merioneth and Carnarvon&s;hire, would &s;trike his eye at almo&s;t every hour's journey|ing. The traveller of imagination would feel an unwonted glow of head and heart, perhaps, in a warmer degree, and of a more fa&s;cinating
<PB N="15" REF="76">kind, than the traveller of merely a ju&s;t ta&s;te. The poetic and pictorial traveller, endued with the enthu&s;ia&s;m proper to tho&s;e characters, would have a more animated plea&s;ure from a &s;urvey of &s;uch &s;ort of beauties, than a per&s;on who has been in the habit of deriving his &s;atisfactions rather from the refined labours of art, than the ea&s;y operations of nature: but all de|grees of under&s;tanding and feeling, nay the &s;oul it&s;elf would be gratified in a tour through Wales, allowing time to do ju&s;tice to nature and them&s;elves: and, indeed, none but the mo&s;t worthle&s;s or di&s;&s;ipated of human kind could ob&s;erve, within the limit of a morning's ride or walk, &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of natural wonders, viewed at any period of the year, without ta&s;ting a plea&s;ure of that moral kind, which, in looking above or below, mu&s;t pro|nounce the objects of divine origin. I have &s;tood gazing on &s;ome&mdash;Snowden and Plin|limmon, the vales of &mdash; and of Cluyn, for in&s;tance, till they &s;eemed of them&s;elves to &s;ay&mdash;Traveller! well maye&s;t thou gaze: we merit your pious admiration&mdash;for we are of God.</P>
<P>But my enthu&s;ia&s;m is running my letter into too much length. Invoking, therefore, the ble&s;&s;ing of that God on you, I bid you for the pre&s;ent&mdash;adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>South Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A YOUNG painter of genius in a &s;ummer tour, from Abergavenny to Milford Haven, South, and from Aberconway to Holyhead, in|cluding the I&s;le of Angle&s;ey, North, taking into his route the intermediate land&s;capes and &s;ea-pieces right and left, and making tho&s;e pau&s;es which are nece&s;&s;ary to exact ob&s;ervation, and tho&s;e deviations from the beaten to the unfrequented tract, where, indeed, the cha&s;ter beauties of nature are to be found, as if they mode&s;tly withdrew from the gaze of every common pa&s;&s;enger, could not fail returning home richly &s;tored with materials for the win|ter exerci&s;e of his fini&s;hing pencil. Or more properly advi&s;ed, and duly ambitious of be|ing ju&s;t to nature as his original, and to him&s;elf as her imitator, were he to employ the winter only in giving to his fir&s;t &s;ketches a more correct form, then to make the &s;ame tour the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer to meliorate and improve, to catch new graces which new ver|dure may po&s;&s;ibly have given them, to be&s;tow that mellowing, which the mo&s;t vigorous mind and brighte&s;t fancy derives from preci&s;ion, without which, indeed, every compo&s;ition of
<PB N="17" REF="78">human art can hope but tran&s;itory fame; were he then to occupy his &s;econd winter to the la&s;t poli&s;hes, then &s;end them to Somer&s;et Hou&s;e, I will venture to &s;ay he would exhibit, to his country, one of the mo&s;t beautiful, one of the mo&s;t valuable collections that had, till then, been &s;een in the mo&s;t &s;elect of her cabinets; accompanied by this peculiar honour and novelty&mdash;namely, that it was taken from an original properly her own: a truth which nineteen out of twenty that had never &s;een that original would be far from &s;u&s;pecting: nay, I am furthermore convinced that even the be&s;t judges, the mo&s;t celebrated arti&s;ts, under the like predicament, would di&s;tribute the differ|ent land&s;capes to as many different countries&mdash; appropriating the &s;cenery of one to Savoy, a &s;econd to Lau&s;anne, a third to the beautiful Pays de Vaud, and &s;o on: for all that charac|teri&s;e the&s;e lovely countries, a&s;&s;emble in the prin|cipality of Wales. The Cambrian excur&s;ion I have here recommended to the young and ingenious arti&s;ts of my country in particular, would, were they to travel pencil in hand, unite the merits of the patriot to the talents of the painter, and be productive of objects no le&s;s worthy the lovers of their art, than the lovers of their country. It is hence, that I would incite tho&s;e who are ble&s;t with abilities,
<PB N="18" REF="79">and who incline to devote them to the mu&s;e of painting, to a journey of <HI>deliberation</HI> through Wales, before they go farther from home, con|vinced, that if the &s;tudy and imitation of nature, only, were, as it obviou&s;ly is, the perfection of their art, a great deal of that time and money, which is expended in getting to the u&s;ual &s;eminaries, and &s;cenery, might be &s;aved; for I repeat, that this little appendage to the crown of England, contains, within it&s;elf, the riche&s;t &s;tores for the pencil, which can be contented with nature or with nature's God.</P>
<P>Does the painter look for the broad and beautiful expan&s;e of the &s;ea, with all its attend|ant rocks, terminating towers, romantic &s;hell|work, and &s;urrounding &s;hores? They await him on the coa&s;t of Wales at innumerable openings. They &s;alute him at the new and old pa&s;&s;age, even as he fir&s;t &s;ets his foot on the Cambrian &s;oil: He meets them again gathering beauties as he goes, in various parts of Caer|marthen&s;hire: they &s;mile on him as he vi&s;its the mouldering ca&s;tle, and romantic &s;cenery of the &s;weet village Laugharne, in that county. &mdash;At Kidwelly and Llanelthy, they again re|gale. Swan&s;ea offers them to him in all the pride of charms, that have drawn the admira|tion of the fa&s;hionable world. They accom|pany,
<PB N="19" REF="80">refre&s;h, and delight him, even to Milford|Haven, where they lo&s;e them&s;elves in un|bounded ocean. Nor are the marine objects le&s;s beautiful in the northern di&s;tricts. At Towyn, Abere&s;twith, Caernarvon, Harleigh, Penmorva, Bangor, Angle&s;ey, Barmouth, &amp;c. they in|crea&s;e in every grace of the grand and minute.</P>
<P>Does the youthful enthu&s;ia&s;t pant after the &s;ublime beauties peculiar to the land? Here are they in the mo&s;t profu&s;e abundance. The mountains are here, who&s;e immen&s;e height illu&s;trates and ju&s;tifies that bold imagery of the Poet, who&s;e de&s;criptions would appear the work of fancy, and of fancy run riot, to all tho&s;e who have never yet look'd at the a&s;piring &s;ub|limities of nature as they pre&s;ent them&s;elves in Merioneth&s;hire, and other northern parts of this i&s;land. The truth and the de&s;cription of it, are thus exactly given in the poetry of Gold&s;mith,
<Q><L>"As &s;ome tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,</L>
<L>"Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the &s;torm;</L>
<L>"Tho' round its brea&s;t the rolling clouds are &s;pread,</L>
<L>"Eternal &s;un&s;hine &s;ettles on its head."</L></Q></P>
<P>The clouds, indeed, &s;eem &s;ometimes to i&s;&s;ue from the feet, and &s;ometimes from the bowels of the&s;e mountains, in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;teaming &s;ides of
<PB N="20" REF="81">which the traveller is, on the brighte&s;t day, in|volved in the thicke&s;t mi&s;t, while the &s;ummit of the mountain, above, and of the valley, be|low are gilded by &s;unbeams, which the vapours have not fullied.</P>
<P>Or, langui&s;hes our child of genius for the mountain Cataract, who&s;e white foam is pre|cipitated, by the torrent, down its romantic, but rugged, &s;ides, till it reaches the di&s;tant vale, where it rolls over the dark rocks, made yet darker by the thick oaks that overhang them; the deepe&s;t green mo&s;s growing on the parts of rock not wa&s;hed by the turbulent, but laved only by the gentle waves that occa&s;ionally overflow them? Would he wi&s;h to hear a beauty that he could not paint, the de&s;cription of which he mu&s;t re&s;ign to the poet, viz. The &s;tunning &s;ound of the &s;ame Cataract, &s;oftening by de|grees into the &s;till, &s;mall, and &s;weet, voice of the rill, which &s;teals gradually out of hearing, along the woody dingle, where it dies away? If his genius leads to the&s;e, they are to be met with in Wales. I have clambered up the mountains, where they were pa&s;&s;able to human a&s;cent; I have followed the &s;ound of the tor|rents, from the fir&s;t deafening impetuo&s;ity, to the la&s;t of its meanders through the valley; and have been paid for my excur&s;ion by innumer|able
<PB N="21" REF="82">beauties, which nature hides, as it were, in her nooks and corners, and denies the &s;ight or &s;cent of to every one who does not deem them worth &s;earching for. It is almo&s;t a par|tiality unwarranted to point at any place in particular, where the&s;e charms, for the true lovers of nature, may be di&s;covered, they are &s;o generally di&s;tributed throughout the princi|pality; but if I am ju&s;tified in giving the preference to any &s;pots, I &s;hould mention Merioneth&s;hire, and the country about Ponti|pool as mo&s;t replete with the&s;e beauties&mdash; the&s;e and a thou&s;and more.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me, indeed, to give ade|quate &s;ketches of the countle&s;s charms a tra|veller of genius will di&s;cover in this route. The mo&s;t vivid de&s;criptions of Gilpin, joined to the &s;olid narratives of Pennant, &s;hould rather animate, than di&s;courage, to the journey. The living eye of &s;uch a traveller &s;hould not be contented with any thing &s;hort of the living volume; in every page and pa&s;&s;age of which, nature will here pre&s;ent him with &s;omething to admire and imitate&mdash;&s;omething, which; though admired and de&s;cribed before, will &s;upply new de&s;cription, new imitation. In truth, the proper objects of genius can here never be exhau&s;ted, nor genius it&s;elf fatigued with re|pre&s;enting
<PB N="22" REF="83">them. So redundant are the &s;ports of nature in this happy &s;oil, that with a &s;light change of your point of view and the &s;ame &s;pot of ground will afford a &s;et of land&s;capes: Taken from the top of the mountain you may &s;ketch the valley apart, and it is &s;ufficiently enriched to fill your canva&s;s, and call your imitative powers into the warme&s;t exertion; taken from the valley you have another &s;eparate picture &mdash;the fir&s;t intere&s;ting, &s;oft, and delicate; the &s;econd noble, animated, and &s;ublime: join their &s;everal beauties by taking them in a middle direction between both, and, reverencing nature and your&s;elf, you will prove the truth of my before repeated a&s;&s;ertion, that it is un|nece&s;&s;ary to quit your native empire, to gain the wreathe of immortality as a painter.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, I beg of you, for thus enlarging on the&s;e beauties, with a view to bringing them upon canva&s;s, but be&s;ides that, I know you both love and cultivate the art in private; many of our mutual friends, among&s;t which is the enchanting De Loutherberg, and the brother of the ingenious Bar&s;ett, worthy the relation|&s;hip, are public ornaments of it. I am per|&s;uaded that if the former of the&s;e arti&s;ts were to vi&s;it the &s;cenes I have here alluded to, his mo&s;t glowing and ju&s;tly celebrated land&s;capes
<PB N="23" REF="84">from Switzerland, which we have &s;o often ad|mired in his de&s;criptions, as well as on his canva&s;s, would have companions of Wel&s;h extraction highly de&s;erving that honour. And I wi&s;h in your next conver&s;ation you would &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e hints.</P>
<P>But it is time to commit my long letter upon paintings&mdash;which you may, perhaps, call an epi&s;tle to painters&mdash;to the po&s;t. Farewell then for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>North Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I have already &s;aid, and what I &s;till wi&s;h to communicate, in regard to this finely romantic country, is, as I before noted, rather the re&s;ult of the remarks I made &s;ome months ago, than what occurs at the pre&s;ent time. My health, as you remember, compell|ing my immediate ab&s;ence from London, and my affairs, neverthele&s;s, requiring &s;ome ar|rangement before I could quit the Engli&s;h ter|ritories, for any length of time likely to do e&s;&s;ential good to my con&s;titution, or to the circum&s;tances that tended to impair it, I ac|cepted, in the mean while, of an occa&s;ion that offered, to make a circuitous tour of Wales. You may be &s;ure that the &s;entimental pictures of Gilpin, and the hi&s;torical accounts of Pen|nant were in my portmanteau.</P>
<P>Both of the above named authors being deli|berate, and even re&s;identiary travellers, nothing was left behind but a few general ob&s;ervations, &s;uch, as I have offered you in the two preceding letters, and &s;ome local particulars of which I
<PB N="25" REF="86">have &s;till to beg your acceptance: but, after &s;o copious an harve&s;t, as has been pre&s;ented by &s;uch labourers, the Gleanings mu&s;t needs be &s;canty, though, I hope, well worth &s;tooping for.</P>
<P>The &s;cenery of Mahuntleth is in the true &s;tile of awful grandeur, &s;tupenduous rocks ri&s;ing above one another in barren &s;ublimity, and forming a natural rampart round the town; in the neighbourhood of which, you ride through one of the mo&s;t lovely vales even <HI>your</HI> imagina|tion can conceive; the more delightful for coming unexpectedly; as, on your fir&s;t leaving the town, you are prepared only for rocks; in&s;tead of which, you enter a lane, about half a mile from the village, which &s;huts you from the farther view of both rocks and village; and conducts you along a green rece&s;s, which con|tinues for many miles, every &s;tep, almo&s;t, of which introduces a fre&s;h beauty. Wood, water, hill and vale, can &s;carce take a form; the &s;ound of &s;treams, the carol of birds, the diver&s;ity of foliage, can hardly be fancied, by the mo&s;t en|thu&s;ia&s;tic lover of nature, which blends not in this &s;hort excur&s;ion. Every thing blooms around you; the mountains vegetate to the top; all the tints and &s;hades of verdure are in your view; neat white cottages, and pretty farm|hou&s;es,
<PB N="26" REF="87">with here and there a modern villa, or ancient man&s;ion, introduce them&s;elves to your eye, as you move on, at &s;uch acceptable di&s;tances, and in &s;uch happy &s;ituations, that even a mat|ter of fact traveller, mu&s;t forget all common|place circum&s;tances, and wi&s;h to be <HI>re&s;identiary.</HI> What then mu&s;t be the effect of &s;uch &s;cenery on the children of fancy? The poetical traveller for in&s;tance? For my own part, I was &s;o rapt and entranced, that, giving my &s;elf up unre&s;erv|edly to the enchantments that &s;urrounded me, I felt a &s;ort of attachment to every object that contributed its beauty to the &s;cene, and was ab&s;olutely in friend&s;hip, in alliance, with the woods, as if I had vegetated with them. A &s;ober citizen, who had &s;een me at this time, would have pronounced me mad; but while he pitied me, I &s;hould have compa&s;&s;ionated him; &s;ince. in this kind of delirium, ari&s;ing from an heart and imagination delighted, and, as it were, carried beyond them&s;elves, by the charms of nature, there is a plea&s;ure, which, what is pro|perly under&s;tood by the words, &s;ober citizen never knew. I have often told you,&mdash;with &s;elf|gratification, and grateful thanks to the bounteous be&s;tower,&mdash;of this my exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility of vegetable beauty: It began from the fir&s;t hour that I could di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt &s;terility and bloom. A garden, a wood, a rill, an immen&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="88">mountain, an almo&s;t untrodden path in a valley, the interminable ocean, the contracted &s;tream, and all that nature inherits, were my delight, when my love of them was rather in&s;tinct than ob&s;ervation. The pa&s;&s;ion <Q>grew with my growth, and &s;trengthened with my &s;trength.</Q>&mdash;It &s;trewed ro&s;es over the years of my youth, and made me often forget the numberle&s;s thorns which environed them.&mdash; The years of manhood that have &s;trengthened my rea&s;on, have in no degree abated my &s;incere&mdash;I had almo&s;t written&mdash;my tender delight in the&s;e charms of the creation.&mdash; And why &s;hould I not feel a tender affec|tion towards them: Do they not lead from things temporal to things eternal? from earth to heaven? from creation to the Crea|tor? Is not, therefore, the adoration I pay to them a virtue? A part of religious wor&s;hip? At the time I was enveloped&mdash;<HI>emparadi&s;ed</HI> let me call it rather, in this bli&s;sful &s;olitude, I felt that it was a time more detached from the dro&s;s of the world, and more pure, than probably the be&s;t &s;ociety could have made it. Will the man of cold &s;en&s;e pronounce all this vi&s;ionary? No. It is &s;ub&s;tantial&mdash;to me at lea&s;t it has been the &s;ource, and, I hope, will continue to be, of the highe&s;t &s;entiments and contemplation.
<PB N="28" REF="89">May I live only while I am &s;en&s;ibly alive to the beauties of nature! For, in the hour this affection quits me, the &s;acred &s;en&s;e of the great Author of the&s;e beauties, which my exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of them kindles in my &s;oul&mdash;which even the lowlie&s;t &s;hrub, or &s;imple&s;t blade of gra&s;s; now in&s;pires, could no more a&s;cend to the power from whom I received this &s;en&s;ibi|lity, than the autumnal leaf, that has withered on the ground, can again mount and flouri&s;h on the tree from which it has fallen.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure, therefore, of which I have been &s;peaking, is among&s;t the few that belong to the poetical mind, in balance of the numberle&s;s evils which are &s;aid to be in&s;eparable from the votaries of the mu&s;e.</P>
<P>But you have been mu&s;e-led too long, and I have to beg your pardon for a digre&s;&s;ion, which offers you rather a de&s;cription of my own &s;en|&s;ations than of the place which excited them. Let us return then to the &s;weet &s;hades, out of which my &s;elfi&s;h fancy flew away with you. I really abhor egoti&s;m, but in letters that mix the hi&s;tory of ones feelings, with that of our wanderings, it is the mo&s;t difficult thing in the world not to be an egoti&s;t. All that can be fairly expected, indeed, in travelling epi&s;tles,
<PB N="29" REF="90">is, to make, as it were, our ab&s;ent corre&s;pondent enjoy what we have enjoyed, profit by his plea|&s;ures, by making them our own, if ever we take the &s;ame route, and e&s;cape the inconveniences, which he warns us to avoid. In this character of a friendly direction-po&s;t I may be u&s;eful: Take courage, therefore, and accompany me once more into the woods of Mahuntleth, and let me in&s;truct you, by the way, that this is a little market town, in northern Cambria, in the road to Abere&s;twith, a town in &s;ome reputation, as a bathing place you know. If you, who, I know, pay an annual vi&s;it to the &s;ea nymphs, &s;hould direct your watery cour&s;e hitherward, I charge you in the name of nature, to make a day's pau&s;e at Mahuntleth, where you will find good accommodation, and dedicate it to wood nymphs, in the &s;ilvan &s;cenes I have been de&s;cribing: re|membering, only, to take the hor&s;e road to Dolgelthy; another place abounding in vege|table beauty. The di&s;tance from Mahuntleth to the la&s;t named town, this bridle way, is &s;carcely &s;even miles, not to be complained of with a &s;teed you have faith in, and even if the hor&s;e had forfeited your confidence fifty times, while your eyes e&s;caped you would forgive him for &s;hewing you &s;o many delicious &s;cenes: what is better, he would annihilate the &s;en&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="91">of danger, by making you forget both his errors, and tho&s;e of every body el&s;e. Do you not perceive that my fancy is again kindling? An hazardous time to re-enter the woods. Is it not to be feared, I &s;hall lo&s;e my&s;elf in them? Suppo&s;e then I allow my&s;elf time to cool be|fore I venture again into this wilderne&s;s of &s;weets? It may be as well perhaps for us both. Adieu then.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>North Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER about two hours riding, in this charming country, you come to a &s;pot &s;o ex|qui&s;itely delightful, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for a poet, or a lover, whether his mi&s;tre&s;s is na|ture, or a pretty woman, or indeed for any tra|veller, who has enough of romance to keep in motion tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which, like whole&s;ome breezes, &s;hould always ventilate to prevent the ma&s;s from &s;tagnating.&mdash;It is in &s;hort, impo&s;&s;ible for any but the &s;ordid worldling, not to pau&s;e in this place, and wi&s;h to pa&s;s the evening of his days in its vicinity:
<Q>"Ducere &s;olicita jucunda oblivia vitae."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="92">It is a part of the valley defended by an im|men&s;e &s;creen of many coloured rocks behind, out of which &s;prings, here and there, a few hardy &s;hrubs and flowers; &s;tupendous crags, which the hurricanes have thrown from a ridge of mountains, who&s;e mutilated heads are &s;till in the clouds: Some of the&s;e crags have been &s;topped midway, where, though they menace a farther de&s;cent, when a&s;&s;ailed by the next &s;torm, they have &s;tood the fiege of the elements, unmoved, for ages: Other va&s;t and mi&s;hapen ma&s;&s;es have found their way to the bottom, and lie at the &s;ide of the road&mdash;to the left of which is a broad &s;tream of water, here foaming into natural ca&s;cades, and there di&s;playing a ba&s;on &s;o untroubled and limpid, that you lan|gui&s;h to bathe in it; which you might very &s;e|curely do, for it is, in many places, &s;o &s;haded, and, if you follow the labyrinths, will guide you to retreats, where, lo&s;ing the foot path, you reach a rece&s;s where the Graces might bathe without alarm. Had Thom&s;on's Mu&s;idora cho&s;en this &s;pot &s;he might have
<Q><L>"Stripp'd her beauteous limbs</L>
<L>"To ta&s;te the lucid coolne&s;s of the flood."</L></Q> without the lea&s;t hazard of being &s;urprized by a Damon&mdash;unle&s;s his re&s;idence, in the neigh|bourhood, gave him knowledge of the &s;ecret
<PB N="32" REF="93">haunt&mdash;or, as in Damon's Ca&s;e, he was remark|ably fortunate. For Damons there are, even here, I can a&s;&s;ure you, and Mu&s;idoras too, among&s;t the pea&s;antry in particular, the &s;wains being as hale, happy a &s;et of round faced, ro&s;y cheeked youths, and the dam&s;els as well featured a race of white toothed, black-eyed, red lipped la&s;&s;es, as in any part of the world.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not omit to tell you, that the natural ca&s;cades, and tran&s;parent baths, before de&s;crib|ed, are &s;o tinted by the refractions of the light and &s;hade, and the variegated rocks, &s;pars, &s;hells, &amp;c. at the bottom, that the water it&s;elf, as well as the flooring, if you will give me leave &s;o to call it, exhibit all the colours of the rainbow, in no le&s;s inimitable dies. This is a natural beauty, I never &s;aw imitated by the painters; perhaps, the imitation of it is im|practicable: indeed, I do not remember ever to have &s;een it, in nature, equally perfect as in this valley. Nor is it le&s;s worthy note, that the foliage of the fine woody mountains that ri&s;e above the&s;e water-works of nature, in nobly &s;ublime contra&s;t of the no le&s;s natural rock-work, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, is not le&s;s di|ver&s;ified than the &s;tream. The vegetation is of every hue of which green is capable;
<PB N="33" REF="94">and an adequate idea of its effect mu&s;t be as difficult for the pen as the pencil. Let it be added, that your eye, be&s;ide the already men|tioned beauties, takes in the celebrated Caer|Idris, one of the loftie&s;t of the Welch moun|tains, the &s;ummit of which, like its famous rivals Snowden and Plinlimmon, is covered with eternal &s;now: while numberle&s;s flocks of &s;heep, who&s;e fleeces, bleached by the wind blowing fre&s;h from the heavens, are &s;carcely le&s;s white than that &s;now&mdash;feed, frolick, and repo&s;e; on its ample &s;ides: The eye aches to view the top of this mountain giant, and the brain turns dizzy as it &s;urveys, by a &s;udden tran&s;ition, the depth of the valley below. Habit, how|ever, familiari&s;es both the&s;e natural wonders; and yet, they &s;eem for ever new.</P>
<P>My imagination was at work, to build ju&s;t &s;uch a comfortable re&s;idence on this &s;pot, as might hold all tho&s;e whom I loved, and who had ta&s;te to &s;hare with me its beauties: among&s;t the&s;e, you, my dear friend, were not forgotten. The above ingenious arti&s;t had already con&s;e|crated an apartment to you, &s;uch as mu&s;t needs have given you content. I had allotted ano|ther, adjoining to yours, to our charming friend, Mrs. L. S. who&s;e &s;pirit &s;o accords with yours; and permit me the flattery of thinking
<PB N="34" REF="95">with my own. This plea&s;ant ca&s;tle in the air went bri&s;kly, though in&s;en&s;ibly, forwards, as I rode on, and the edifice was begun and fini&s;hed, in the mo&s;t commodious manner po&s;&s;ible, with all appurtenances thereto belonging, &s;uch as good fare, good furniture, good wine, and good friends, in about a quarter of an hour: The herds and flocks that grazed on Caer-Idris, I had appropriated; &s;ome fine oxen at feed in the pa&s;tures below, were, with the pa&s;tures them&s;elves, mine al&s;o: in &s;hort, I had fitted up my place fit for the reception of company, and began to exult in the work of my own fancy, when, ca&s;ting my eyes, to the left, from that fixed ground-loving reverie in which they had been involved during the&s;e operations, I di&s;covered exactly &s;uch a man&s;ion ready made to my hands. Con&s;ider the &s;tate, the heat of mind, in which I made this di&s;covery, and wonder not if, in the fir&s;t moment, I fancied I &s;aw only my own edifice.&mdash;It &s;tarted to my view preci&s;ely, when I had given it the la&s;t aerial fini&s;hes; it was embo&s;omed in trees, ju&s;t as I would have it: in a word, it was, to all intents and purpo&s;es, &s;uch as I had been erect|ing, adorning, &amp;c. I need not tell you, who know my &s;oliloquizing way, that I was &s;aunter|ing onward all this while,&mdash;"Sometimes fa&s;t and &s;ometimes &s;low," as the poet &s;ays.&mdash;
<PB N="35" REF="96">Truly, it was a very odd &s;en&s;ation I felt, on being obliged, at la&s;t, to confe&s;s, that it was actually a hou&s;e of more &s;olid materials than imagination commonly works with. How &s;hall I de&s;cribe this to you? I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o pretty a villa, in &s;o happy a &s;ituation, as well as to find that others had ta&s;te as well as my&s;elf; but I was a little mortified&mdash;forgive me&mdash;to perceive any one had, as it were, built upon <HI>my</HI> ground, and &s;uperceded me. Ye rigid people of the world, I pray your pardon. Which of you has not erected his airy ca&s;tle? been delighted while it was in progre&s;s, triumphed in its completion, and mourned its fall?</P>
<P>My chagrin, however, was but of a moment. I had been &s;ufficiently amu&s;ed with the &s;hadow, and was &s;oon in friend&s;hip with the &s;ub&s;tance. I had &s;oon rea&s;on to be &s;o. The proprietor of this man&s;ion, with a child in each hand, was &s;tanding at his gate. He had one of the mo&s;t inviting countenances I ever &s;aw: it en|couraged a &s;tranger to begin conver&s;ation, and to a&s;k any que&s;tions, with an a&s;&s;urance of their being graciou&s;ly an&s;wered. On my fir&s;t greet|ing, he came down to the road &s;ide, and, with an urbanity that would have graced a court, entered with me into di&s;cour&s;e. On hearing my
<PB N="36" REF="97">eulogy on the beauty of the place, and receiv|ing my felicitations on the enviable &s;ituation of his villa, he begged I would con&s;ider my|&s;elf as the ma&s;ter of it, as long as might be agreeable or convenient to me, a&s;&s;uring me of the mo&s;t unfeigned welcome if I could put up with cottagers' fare. To &s;trengthen his invita|tion, he ob&s;erved that the &s;urrounding ob|jects could not, po&s;&s;ibly, be duly &s;een at one view;&mdash;that the colouring of the water, its re|po&s;e, its rapidity, the contra&s;t of the barren and fertile mountains, and of the rocks, had different beauties at different times of the day, and that after a night's refre&s;hment, I &s;hould find them far more intere&s;ting; adding that there were many others, which lay out of the common tract, in the like &s;tyle of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;ublimity, and to which he would be him&s;elf my conductor in the morning, on the condi|tion of my being his gue&s;t that night. This was offered with &s;o frank an air, with &s;o much unque&s;tioned di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, that I intreat of you and your party, if you ever take this tour, to make your be&s;t bows and curt&s;eys to this ho&s;pitable cottager. His villa is about the midway between Mahuntleth, and Dolgelthy; but it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould e&s;cape your no|tice; for without the&s;e memento's, I am &s;ure
<PB N="37" REF="98">here would your foot be fixed, and here your heart would warm.</P>
<P>Nor is this ho&s;pitality rare in this country. It anciently, you know, formed its charac|teri&s;tic. Modern manners have not altogether refined it away. I witne&s;&s;ed its exi&s;tence, during my tour, in a great many in&s;tances. In taking the exerci&s;es of the field for example, every farm, every cottage, is yours, as places of repo&s;e and refre&s;hment, and the bounty ex|tends to your dumb companions as well as to your&s;elf&mdash;milk, butter, chee&s;e, and barakerk, oat-bread, a clean cloth, a platter of hung|beef, a jugg of beer, and a cann of cyder, are placed before you, as matters of cour&s;e, with|out a&s;king for, and your being a &s;tranger is a &s;ufficient recommendation: nay, you would be thought cruel to &s;uffer from fatigue, hunger, or bad weather, while &s;uch &s;helter and enter|tainment was in your reach. As this is among&s;t the facts which a re&s;identiary traveller only could know, and as it is really a truth, that runs through the country, e&s;pecially the northern parts, I feel my&s;elf the more bound to mention it. Nor is it confined to the low and middle ranks only. People of family are every where under a pre&s;criptive nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up certain forms, but with re&s;pect to
<PB N="38" REF="99">Wales, a very &s;light acquaintance with you, would &s;ecure a mo&s;t cordial reception in the hou&s;es of the gentry and nobility: and many of the&s;e live in the &s;olid fa&s;hions, and keep up the good old cu&s;toms of ancient days&mdash;&s;till re|taining their hawker, their harper, their do|me&s;tic bard, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A venerable man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Vaughan, member for Merioneth&s;hire, who, &s;ince this letter was written, is dead.</NOTE>, member for the very county which &s;upplies the &s;cenes I have been de&s;cribing, may be quoted as an in&s;tance. His &s;tate of health has, for &s;ome time, "check'd the genial current of his &s;oul;" but his hou&s;e has been long the temple of good humour, ho&s;pitality, and cheerfulne&s;s, in a &s;tile that might put to the blu&s;h, the proud re&s;erves, and &s;elfi&s;h pomps of up&s;tart greatne&s;s, and mu&s;h|room preten&s;ions to &s;tate and di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>Such, in very general expre&s;&s;ions, are the farmers, pea&s;ants, and gentry, of the country, which gives a title to the Heir Apparent, of one of the mo&s;t valuable crowns, and to one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Princes in the Chri&s;tian world. It were devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that, with equal truth, I could pay an
<PB N="39" REF="100">equal tribute to the pea&s;antry, farmers, and gentry, in England; but I fear the unbought, di&s;intere&s;ted urbanity of the&s;e to &s;trangers, whether of their own country or of any other, mu&s;t be looked upon rather as exceptions than general rules. When I reflect upon the &s;ub|&s;tantial charities, and benevolence of the peo|ple of England, on all great occa&s;ions, I triumph in being, my&s;elf, an Engli&s;hman, but I &s;hall cea&s;e to regret, my friend, that in the &s;ponta|neous courte&s;ies, the little impromptu's of civility, that grow out of the wants and wi&s;hes of the moment, and are to be gratified by di&s;|pen&s;ing with all formal re&s;erves, tedious in|troductions, and &s;u&s;picious balancings, the Welch, the Scotch, the Iri&s;h, the French, and many other people are their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Whence can this take its ri&s;e? Is it pride, di&s;tru&s;t, an apprehen&s;ion of being deluded? Is it an in&s;ular kind of re&s;ervation? A &s;hutting up of the heart till it is woo'd and won? Or is it a mixture of all the&s;e? Whatever be the cau&s;e, the effect is to be deplored: for much plea&s;ure is lo&s;t to him who has too much etiquette, fear, or dignity, to &s;toop to imme|diate occurrences: the opportunity of doing a kindne&s;s is lo&s;t in a moment, and if our doors are to be opened only to receive a friend,
<PB N="40" REF="101">and a &s;tranger mu&s;t bring credentials of his be|ing entitled to the en pa&s;&s;ant benevolence, by being known to &s;ome of our friends or neigh|bours, though unknown to our&s;elves, a thou&s;and urbanities, which might have been &s;hewn mu&s;t be omitted. A temper betwixt the extremes of French officiou&s;ne&s;s, and Engli&s;h phlegm, would form a good middle character. From many ob&s;ervations, daring my late intercour&s;e among&s;t all ranks in this country, I am di&s;po&s;ed to think that Welch courte&s;y is the happy me|dium, &s;o far as goes to the reception of, and good offices &s;hewn to &s;trangers. The fire of the French, at fir&s;t fight, is too hot to la&s;t; the fro&s;t of the Engli&s;h takes too much time in thawing, and though their bounty is but the more &s;olid and effectual, when the ice of their con&s;titutional&mdash;perhaps only atmo&s;pherical&mdash; re&s;erve is di&s;&s;olved, like certain fruits of the earth, after the &s;now that long covered them is melted, the occa&s;ion is pa&s;t away, and the object that &s;tood in need of our temporary exertions, may have gone even be|yond the reach of our be&s;t &s;ervices, while the fires of benevolence are kindling. Not but I know many happy exceptions; among&s;t which I &s;hould not &s;cruple, were I called upon, by way of challenge, to produce a na|tive
<PB N="41" REF="102">of the gloomy i&s;land, as foreigners &s;ome|times call it, who to peculiar tenderne&s;s of the affections, for particular and private friends, unites a large, and indeed univer&s;al philan|thropy, the effect of which extends courte&s;y, gentlene&s;s, and generous actions to people of all nations, di&s;pen&s;ing kind words and good deeds, wherever they are implored, I &s;hould name your&s;elf&mdash;and not without exultation, that I have the honour to be your friend.&mdash; Adieu.</P>
<P>P. S. I &s;hall leave the northern and return to the &s;outhern part of Wales to-morrow, with intent to take a little &s;ea-bathing, before I en|tirely quit the country. I will give you the re&s;t of my Gleanings from the court of Neptune.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Barmouth, North Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE, as the date will &s;hew you, altered my route; to which I have been in|duced by a wi&s;h to pay my parting tribute to the place from which I now addre&s;s you. The road from Mahuntleth to Dolgelthy, I tru&s;t, my la&s;t has made you acquainted with: that from Dolgelthy to Barmouth, a &s;pace only of ten miles, can, like the other, be done full ju&s;tice to only by your own eyes, for its beauties are &s;o manifold and extraordinary, that they literally "beggar de&s;cription." Suppo&s;e your|&s;elf mounted on your hor&s;e, or &s;eated in your carriage on a clear genial day, as able from health, as di&s;po&s;ed from ta&s;te and temper, to enjoy the beauties that offer them&s;elves to your view. Under the&s;e happy circum&s;tances the&s;e ten miles would be the &s;horte&s;t, and the mo&s;t plea&s;ant you have pa&s;t in your whole life. New pa&s;tures of the mo&s;t exuberant &s;ertility, new woods ri&s;ing in the maje&s;ty of foliage, the road it&s;elf curving in numberle&s;s unexpected directions, at one moment &s;hut into a verdant rece&s;s, &s;o contracted that there &s;eems neither
<PB N="43" REF="104">carriage or bridle way out of it; at another the azure expan&s;e of the main ocean filling your eye&mdash;on one &s;ide of you, rocks glittering in all the colours of that beauty, which con&s;ti|tutes the &s;ublime, and of an height that dimi|ni&s;hes the wild herds that brow&s;e, or look down upon you from the &s;ummits, where the large&s;t animal appears in&s;ignificantly minute&mdash;on the other hand plains, villas, cottages, venerable halls, or cop&s;es, with whatever tends to form that milder grace, that belongs to the beautiful. &mdash;Such are &s;ome of the objects you will meet with in your excur&s;ion to Barmouth: on your arrival at which place, &s;o far from your pro&s;pects terminating with your journey, they open upon you fre&s;h attractions, which are as &s;ingular as unexpected.</P>
<P>This little &s;eaport, con&s;i&s;ts of one irregular &s;treet only, one &s;ide of which is built upon the &s;olid, rocky mountain, that is of &s;o &s;tupendous an height, that the fir&s;t view of it, upon the traveller's entrance into the village, or taken from the &s;ea-&s;ide, makes him not only tremble for him&s;elf, but for the aerial inhabitants; out of that mountain rock are their habitations formed, and though the con&s;i&s;tence is rather weak than &s;trong, as, after much drought or rain, it will crumble under your feet as you
<PB N="44" REF="105">tread on it, the hou&s;es are in excellent repair, and &s;eem, like tho&s;e that re&s;ide in them, to &s;et winds and waves at defiance. The villagers are, probably, more hardy than their native mountains&mdash;much more &s;o, I &s;hould judge, than their crumbling rocks, if their weather beaten complexions, and hard hands, which, in my familiar, character-exploring way, I have &s;ometimes &s;haken&mdash;may be con&s;idered as &s;amples. You &s;eem to be care&s;&s;ing a man of iron, and that iron appears to be covered with a leather, that has undergone the proce&s;s, and taken the tan, of the material, with which our Engli&s;h waggon whips are commonly made. The chief food of the pea&s;antry is fi&s;h, which is had in the greate&s;t abundance; and it may be reckoned among&s;t the plea&s;ant objects of the place, to &s;ee the natives in their little fi&s;hing boats, on a fine morning, when the &s;ea is calm. If you look at them from the rocky &s;ide of the village, the boats &s;eem like buoys, and the people that guide them are &s;carcely percepti|ble. The village it&s;elf, viewed on the con|trary, from the ocean, is the mo&s;t picture&s;que you can imagine. On account of the excel|lence of the beach, it is an admirable watering place, and a good bath may be had almo&s;t every day. In tempe&s;tuous weather, the a&s;&s;emblage of objects, are, taken together, the
<PB N="45" REF="106">mo&s;t &s;ublime of any in the principality. The dark &s;hading, and &s;tupendous height of the&s;e rocks, which overhang the ocean, the mountain billows, that, a&s;cending midway, da&s;h again&s;t them, as if di&s;appointed in their ambition to reach the &s;ummit.&mdash;The ve&s;&s;els that &s;eem crouding into the harbour, and almo&s;t taking &s;helter in the hou&s;es upon the beach. The buildings on the rocks, meanwhile, &s;eeming to demand no protection, but to mock the &s;torm&mdash;the in|numerable quantity of &s;ea-birds that enjoy it&mdash; all the&s;e go towards the &s;cenery&mdash;and if thunder and lightning are added to it, which are very frequent accompaniments, the rever|beration of the &s;ound among&s;t the rocks, the terrific charms of the fla&s;hes on the objects, both on &s;ea and &s;hore, with the intermingled roar of the waves, fini&s;h the climax, if I may &s;o call it, of the true &s;ublime. You may, per|haps, a&s;k, if this &s;cenery is not in every mountainous country, near the &s;ea, pretty much the &s;ame? I an&s;wer, certainly in a de|gree: but it is the <HI>&s;uperlative</HI> degree of awful grandeur, you find in this place, and all I have hitherto &s;een of the magnificence of nature, in the time of her trouble, has been compara|tively feeble, to her exhibitions in and about Barmouth.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="107">But it is time, that I bring both you and my&s;elf, &s;afe down from the&s;e Alps of Cambria, where you may, perhaps, think I have &s;taid, with you, too long, particularly when the black mountains were wrapt in &s;torm, and the nature of the &s;urrounding objects made me in danger of becoming poetical, which, is a rock wor&s;e to the &s;ober minded reader, than any I have mentioned; yet on which, too many travellers &s;plit. Neverthele&s;s, I have only cropp'd a few of the flowers, which others failed to gather. In traver&s;ing a &s;pacious garden, even with avowed intent of forming a bouquet, it is im|po&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t a profu&s;ion of &s;weets, be&s;towed in "the prodigality of nature," not to leave or overlook many flowerets, and particular &s;pots of exqui&s;ite beauty and fragrance. To pluck and to examine the&s;e, and occa&s;ionally to borrow from others, what may be honourable to them in the repetition, as authors, and agree|able to you, as a reader, is the "head and front" of my office as a Gleaner.</P>
<P>From the labours of the late Mr. Gro&s;&s;e, you, and every reader of ta&s;te, are &s;o well acquainted with the abbeys, ca&s;tles, and other reliques of that time, and of the time of more de&s;tructive men, in the &s;hapes of Kings, Protectors, &amp;c. who, like death, "put all things under their feet,"
<PB N="47" REF="108">that I &s;hall not attempt to re-conduct you to the&s;e remains of power, prie&s;t-craft, and &s;u|per&s;tition: Indeed, were I inclined to &s;earch diligently, it is doubtful, whether I &s;hould be able to pick up a &s;ingle ruin; that accurate antiquarian having left nothing for my glean|ing. Neither &s;hall I &s;ay any thing of Snowden, &mdash;nor a&s;k you to accompany me to the coun|try, where
<Q>"Huge Plinlimmon rears his cloud topp'd head."</Q> both of which have been introduced to you in the be&s;t manner, by Ma&s;on and Gray, the latter of whom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a genius loftier, and more &s;ublime, than the mountains he de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>A few objects, however, <HI>nearer the ground,</HI> remain for me; and if you will conde&s;cend to accept &s;uch humble offerings, after the giddy heights, and fearful precipices, from which I have ju&s;t let you down, they are at your &s;ervice. A quiet walk in the valley, after clambering hills, and buffeting with &s;torms, may relieve you.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, therefore, by way of &s;hewing you a &s;pecimen of the hardy manner in which the poor natural inhabitants of the&s;e craggy abodes live, you &s;tep with me into a hut belonging to one of the Barmouth pea&s;ants. In point of
<PB N="48" REF="109">&s;ituation it might vie with any hermitage, cot, or palace, that prie&s;t, pea&s;ant, or prince ever fixed on for re&s;idence. A noble beach of the fine&s;t &s;and &s;preads it&s;elf at the bottom; the ocean yet nobler extends in front, with all the &s;cenery that moves on the face of the wa|ters: the cliffs of Cardigan&s;hire bounds the pro&s;pect to the right, to the left are &s;een tho&s;e of Caernarvon&s;hire. Clo&s;e at its foot a rill, which is for ever heard but never &s;een, the &s;hrub wood and weeds of a little half-cultivated piece of garden ground bidding defiance to the mo&s;t narrow in&s;pection; and clo&s;e at its back is part of that immen&s;e and continuous rock on which one half of the village is erect|ed: but as tho&s;e are on the &s;ummit, this is at the bottom. The &s;ides, and far the greater part of this hovel (for it is little better) are &s;o thick with ivy, that, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, nothing but that romantic evergreen is to be di&s;covered. A novel writer, or a lover, or a mi&s;anthrope, could imagine nothing half &s;o congenial to their pen&s;ive di&s;po&s;itions: it belongs to nei|ther of the&s;e per&s;onages. Enter it, and &s;urvey the inhabitants. Perhaps there never was con|tained, in &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, &s;uch a variety of occupations going on at the &s;ame time: nor, probably, &s;uch a number of living beings crouded into one cottage, con&s;i&s;ting not only
<PB N="49" REF="110">of one floor, but one very contracted room. That room was built barn fa&s;hion; had more light from the large gaps in the roof, which was of thatch, than from the window. Its walls are of avowed mud, for not &s;o much as a com|mon white wa&s;h, ever attempted to conceal their real compo&s;ition. The family con&s;i&s;ted of fourteen per&s;ons, of which, three were too young to relieve their poverty, though ju&s;t old enough to &s;mile at, and di&s;regard it&mdash;the re&s;t were, as I &s;aid, bu&s;ily employed. The father of the family was making nets, the mo|ther of it was &s;having one of the innkeepers of the place&mdash;of her more anon&mdash;the elde&s;t &s;on was weaving ribbons&mdash;the elde&s;t daughter weaving cloth&mdash;the &s;econd &s;on was mending a petticoat, that for variety of patch-work, might triumph over Otway's Hag&mdash;the &s;e|cond daughter was attempting to repair, what I gue&s;s, might have been intended for her father's breeches, in his younger days, and was now to be converted into a pair for his heir apparent&mdash;the third daughter (he had but three &s;ons) was combing the head of the fourth, who was, with no le&s;s indu&s;try, knitting a pair of &s;tockings&mdash;the &s;ixth girl was making bread&mdash; the &s;eventh was making broth, that is, a col|lection of potatoes, carrots, and other vege|tables&mdash;and the eighth, and la&s;t, was rocking
<PB N="50" REF="111">the cradle of the younge&s;t child with her foot, and dandling another in her arms&mdash;while the fifth was making fir&s;t experiments at the &s;pinning wheel.</P>
<P>The tatters, which were thrown over the&s;e poor artizans, were even more bare and ragged than the furniture, which con&s;i&s;ted of only three mi&s;erable beds, of which one only had curtains, and tho&s;e of yellow &s;tuff, in &s;o ruin|ous a &s;tate, that (as the Copper Captain &s;ays of the rats)&mdash;the moths, and other vermin, "had in&s;tinctively quitted it."&mdash;There was a fourth bed, of a little dirty looking &s;traw, in a corner of the room, with a covering of old &s;acks. Never, did I &s;ee &s;o much indigence, and &s;o much indu&s;try united; for though the latter was un|remitted, the low price of labour, and the number to be &s;upplied from it, and the tender years of mo&s;t of the labourers, made the &s;ource inadequate to the demand upon it; but neither the indu&s;try, nor the indigence, had bani&s;hed the virtues, or the felicities: They were, in|deed, within this lowly re&s;idence, in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate, than is generally to be found in prouder dwellings. All the varieties, which characteri&s;e happine&s;s, in different minds, and ages, were pre&s;ented before me. The father, while he con&s;tructed his net, taught the alpha|bet
<PB N="51" REF="112">to one of his &s;maller children, who was armed with an hornbook.&mdash;The matron &s;trong|ly recommended the la&s;t piece of cloth of her elde&s;t girl's making, to the innkeeper, who&s;e chin &s;he was reaping; thus contriving to carry on two bargains at the &s;ame time; and it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe to you, the &s;atisfaction with which the good man of the hou&s;e ki&s;&s;ed the dirty face of the child, on her getting through her letters without mi&s;calling, or for|getting, more than &s;ixteen out of the twenty|four; or how the good woman chuckled, when her encomia of the linen, conquered the re|luctance of mine ho&s;t, who not only promi&s;ed to become a purcha&s;er of the cloth, then under hand, but to &s;peak favourably of her daughter's handy-works, to the gentry at his hou&s;e. The joke, however, which was, meanwhile, carry|ing on between the &s;econd &s;on and daughter, about the <HI>inver&s;ion</HI> of their u&s;ual occupations, which was a thing agreed on, out of pure &s;port, &s;upplied a mirth, yet more ardent. The con|vention was, "Si&s;ter, if you will repair my breeches, I will mend your petticoat.&mdash;One good turn de&s;erves another." Accordingly, both went to work, during which, a thou&s;and ru&s;tic repartees, and &s;allies of uncultivated wit, which made up in harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s, what they wanted in brilliancy, pa&s;&s;ed in rebound;&mdash;but
<PB N="52" REF="113">the jet of the joke, lay in a &s;truggle, that hap|pened between them, in the progre&s;s of their bu&s;ine&s;s; the brother declaring, his &s;i&s;ter was a bungler; whereupon, there aro&s;e a plea&s;ant contention, which was of &s;erious con&s;equence to the breeches; for they were torn in twain, and, furthermore, &s;o rent as to be unfit for either father or &s;on: this, though no trifling lo&s;s to a family under &s;uch circum&s;tances, made the je&s;t &s;o much the better, that the fa|ther forgave the misfortune, for the &s;ake of the plea&s;ant manner, with which it was brought about, a&s;&s;uring me, that there was more wit in that girl, who had torn the breeches, and more &s;lyne&s;s in the young dog, that was laughing at it, than I could believe. The mother &s;hook her head, &s;aying, they were always at &s;ome mi&s;chief, and would be the ruin of the family; but patted the girl on the cheek, and clapped the boy on the back, while &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the cen|&s;ure on them. Thus does the tenderne&s;s of nature admini&s;ter equivalents, for the poverty of her meane&s;t offspring. The re&s;t of the fa|mily were no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, in mixing amu&s;e|ment with bu&s;ine&s;s: The little &s;tocking-knitter, was telling to the bread maker, a &s;tory of the lights being &s;een, and the groans heard, when there was no per&s;on to carry the one, or to make the other.&mdash;A &s;uper&s;tition, by the bye,
<PB N="53" REF="114">that is intere&s;ting to children of a larger growth, than tho&s;e who were then li&s;tening to it; of which in its place. The little cradle-rocker, was &s;inging a lullaby to the &s;uckling, which was hugging an half &s;tarved kitten in its arms. Find me a family, at once &s;o happy and numer|ous, my friend. When the innkeeper was gone, I &s;at down in the &s;having chair, and from that day, have never cea&s;ed to wi&s;h, there was at lea&s;t, one female barber in every town I pa&s;&s;ed through. This, however, with another at Mahuntleth, were the only ones, I ever met with, in my life, and both of them beat the men at a beard, all to nothing.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t, that you, who, I know, are delighted with the &s;ight of "happy human faces," wherever they can be &s;een, will not be di&s;|plea&s;ed at my having taken you into this humble abode. It may &s;erve to &s;hew you, as a &s;pecimen, the chearful and ince&s;&s;ant labours of the indu&s;trious poor; for, there are very many of this de&s;cription in Wales; and they are the more meritorious, as, though there is infinite poverty, there is &s;carcely any appearance of it, in the whole principality; it being a general, almo&s;t an univer&s;al, principle of the rich, to take care of the poor&mdash;a principle, which like every other good, is often abu&s;ed. For the
<PB N="54" REF="115">number of common beggars, throughout every part of Wales, is a&s;toni&s;hing: they come in tattered tribes to your doors, from which they never go away, if they have no wor&s;e faults than idlene&s;s and indigence, without being relieved. It would even be thought impious to refu&s;e them. Profiting hereby, there are whole fa|milies, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;olely on the charity of their better &s;upplied neighbours. The begging brotherhood of Saint Francis, are not more vagrant, nor more &s;ucce&s;sful in their mendi|catory pilgrimages: and it is not uncommon for the parents, who happen to have &s;ome compunction, on the &s;core of a&s;king alms, while they are able to procure the means of life by their labour, to &s;end out their children to &s;hift as they can, while they them&s;elves are at work: preferring this ca&s;ual, and di&s;graceful, mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for their children, to the hone&s;t in|du&s;try, by which they procure their own main|tenance. There is, however, as you may &s;up|po&s;e, a material difference, even in the poverty of the indu&s;trious, and that of the idle; the former, as in the example of the barber of Bar|mouth, covering the &s;houlders of his family, with <HI>remnants,</HI> which, although
<Q><L>"Coar&s;ely <HI>patch'd</HI> with different colour'd rags,</L>
<L>"Green, red, blue, white, yellow."</L></Q>
<PB N="55" REF="116">certainly &s;peak "variety of <HI>indu&s;try;"</HI> while the latter, though they are neither a&s;hamed to beg, nor &s;teal, and of cour&s;e get their cloaths, with much le&s;s trouble, &s;uffer them to get into tatters, merely becau&s;e they are too lazy to mend them, before they are irreparable. My friend, the barber, indeed, valued him&s;elf on his true Briti&s;h blood, very &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erting, that notwith&s;tanding his pre&s;ent condition, he was the fir&s;t of his family, that had ever gained his bread, by the &s;weat of the brow, and that his father &s;acrificed the e&s;tate, which ought to have de&s;cended to his po&s;terity, to an act of genero&s;ity to the <HI>unfortunate Prince,</HI> meaning the Pretender, who, he added, point|ing to an almo&s;t worn out print of him, that hung on the wall, was more obliged to his father, and better de&s;erved it, than he dared tell me. Not, continued he, but I am a true friend, and loyal &s;ubject, to his Maje&s;ty King George; but that poor Prince&mdash;again pointing to the print&mdash;was a di&s;appointed out-ca&s;t man, wandering up and down this country, and I am proud that my father opened his door to him, though he let out, at the &s;ame time, what pluckt up the hopes of his family by the roots. Hereby, hangs a &s;orrowful tale, ma&s;ter, &s;aid he, &s;ighing, but it is of no u&s;e to trouble you with it: and as for me, it is but doing &s;ome|thing,
<PB N="56" REF="117">in&s;tead of nothing, for my living, which is all the difference you know, Sir, betwixt a poor man and a gentleman; &s;o work away, my lads and la&s;&s;es, work away old Dame Partlet&mdash; for, as the &s;ong &s;ays,&mdash;
<Q><L>"The world is a well-furni&s;h'd table&mdash;</L>
<L>"Where gue&s;ts are promi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;et."&mdash;</L></Q> &s;ung the mother of the family, continuing the tune,&mdash;
<Q>"We all fare as well as we are able."</Q> carolled the elde&s;t daughter, who had really a fine voice.
<Q>"And &s;cramble for what we can get."</Q> chorus, boys and girls, chorus.&mdash;Here the re&s;t of the labourers took up the burthen, and the "long loud laugh" &s;ucceeded, which not only "&s;poke the vacant," but the happy &s;oul. I joined in it, with all my heart, and re&s;olved to recommend as many cu&s;tomers, as I could, to the independent cottagers. And, I hereby beg they may be had in remembrance, when|ever either you, or your friends emigrate to this part of the world, and &s;hould want either nets; &s;having, in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner; home|&s;pun ribbons; home-knit &s;tockings; petti|coats repaired; or breeches de&s;troyed.

<HEAD>LETTER VII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>South Wales.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now re&s;umed my &s;outhern route, and write to you from Abere&s;twith, in my way to which I met with another little cot|tage enterpri&s;e that is &s;o de&s;criptive of that happine&s;s, in the mo&s;t lowly &s;tations of life, of which people in the affluent or even the middle ranks of this variegated world have no manner of idea, that I cannot but imagine a relation of it will be welcome to <HI>you,</HI> whom I know to delight in viewing all &s;ides of the human pic|ture, particularly &s;uch as repre&s;ent any part of the happine&s;s of human beings.</P>
<P>You are yet to learn that I performed, and am &s;till performing, this Cambrian expedition upon the back of my old faithful &s;teed, now in the twenty-fourth year of his age: a creature the be&s;t calculated of all others for the purpo&s;es of a deliberate and re&s;identiary traveller, hav|ing every di&s;po&s;ition in the world to allow his ma&s;ter time for ob&s;ervation and reflection. His character is very truly given in the words of the good old axiom&mdash;"&s;low and &s;ure." His own hi&s;tory is &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting and event|ful to find a place in a heart like your's; and,
<PB N="58" REF="119">in abridgement, I will here give it you. The whole life of this poor &s;lave, till within the two la&s;t years, has been a continued trial of &s;trength, labour, and patience. He was broken to the bit by a York&s;hire jockey, to be rode, the moment he was fit for &s;ervice, by an Oxo|nian &s;cholar, who, whatever might have been his learning in the ab&s;tru&s;er &s;ciences, was little conver&s;ant in the rudiments of humanity, though they are level with the lowe&s;t under|&s;tanding, and founded on the tender code of that great Lawgiver, who has told us "a ju&s;t man is merciful to his bea&s;t." During the very fir&s;t vacation, this &s;prightly youth &s;o com|pletely outrode the &s;trength of his &s;teed, that he &s;old him, on the &s;ame day that he regained his college, at the recommencement of the term, for two guineas, to one of tho&s;e per&s;ons who keep livery &s;tables, and at the &s;ame time have hor&s;es to let. It was not ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible for a poor wretch, &s;o badly &s;ituated before, to change &s;o much for the wor&s;e: and of all the fates that attend a hackney hor&s;e, that which belongs to the drudge of a public univer&s;ity is the mo&s;t &s;ervere: it is even harder than that of the &s;ervitors of the college. He remained in this &s;ervitude, however, &s;ixteen years, during which he was a thou&s;and times not only prie&s;t|ridden, but pari&s;h ridden, and yet was rarely
<PB N="59" REF="120">known to &s;tumble, and never to fall. Is it not que&s;tionable whether half the pari&s;hioners, or even the prie&s;ts (with reverence be it &s;poken) could &s;ay as much for their <HI>own</HI> travels in the rugged journey of life? His ma&s;ter, rather from policy than compa&s;&s;ion, thought it mo&s;t for his &s;uture intere&s;t to allow his four-footed &s;ervant a &s;hort re&s;pite, and he was accordingly favoured with a month's run in what is called a &s;alt mar&s;h; but, before his furlow was expired, he was <HI>borrowed</HI> by &s;ome &s;mugglers, who then infe&s;ted the coa&s;t, and who made him the receiver of contraband commodities, as well as aider and abetter in practices, which, like many other underhand actions, are be&s;t carried on in the night time. I &s;ay <HI>borrowed,</HI> becau&s;e after a winter's hard work in the company of the&s;e land-pirates, the hor&s;e was thrown up by his temporary employers in the very mar&s;h out of which he had been pre&s;&s;ed into their &s;ervice, and a leathern label, on which was marked this facetious intelligence, fa&s;tened to his fet|lock&mdash;<HI>Owner, I have been &s;muggled.</HI> By the&s;e means he unexpectedly came again into his quondam ma&s;ter's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, out of which, however, he departed, the &s;ummer after in the &s;ociety of an old fellow commoner, who, after many years clo&s;e confinement in the cloi&s;ters, was di&s;po&s;ed to relinqui&s;h them in favour of a
<PB N="60" REF="121">piece of church preferment in Norfolk, which happened to be in the gift of a lady about his own &s;tanding in life, and who in the days of her youth avowed &s;o &s;trong a partiality for this gentleman, that her father, di&s;approving her alliance with a per&s;on who had only the hopes of a curacy before his eyes, thought fit to clog her inheritance, over which he had complete authority, with a formidable condition of for|feiting the whole e&s;tates, &s;hould &s;he marry a &s;on of the church: &s;hutting out, hereby, the whole body of divinity to exclude the afore&s;aid individual member. Faithful, however, to the merits of the man who had won her heart, &s;he was glad to find that the parental tyranny which had tied her hand, had left free her for|tune; &s;he, therefore, took the fir&s;t opportunity to pre&s;ent the object of her early choice with the only piece of &s;ervice in her power&mdash;a pre|&s;entation to the living of which &s;he was become the patrone&s;s, thinking this a better evidence of her &s;till exi&s;ting partiality, than if &s;he had &s;et fortune at defiance, and &s;acrificed not only her own advantages but her lover's, to gratify|ing a pa&s;&s;ion which would have impoveri&s;hed both. An example of tenderne&s;s, this, well worthy the imitation of more romantic minds. It was to be inducted to this living our learned clerk now journeyed on the ancient &s;teed
<PB N="61" REF="122">who&s;e memoirs I am now writing, and as he did not intend to revi&s;it the banks of I&s;is, and had often been &s;ecurely carried to a neighbour|ing chapel, where he officiated, on the back of this identical hor&s;e, he purcha&s;ed him to the intent that he &s;hould get into a good living al&s;o. But the turbulent part of this poor brute's adventures was not yet performed. His patron died without him&s;elf deriving what might have been expected from his benefice; and &s;oon after the decea&s;e of the ma&s;ter, the &s;ervant fell into the hands of a man in the &s;ame pari&s;h, who, to a variety of other endea|vours to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a large and needy family, added that of letting out occa&s;ionally a hor&s;e. Our hero, &s;till unbroken in either knees or con&s;ti|tution, was deemed fit for his purpo&s;e, and being thought of little value, was obtained at an ea&s;y price. His new ma&s;ter removed &s;oon after to Lowe&s;toft, which you know is a con&s;iderable &s;ea-bathing town, in the county of Suffolk, where the toils impo&s;ed by his Oxford tyrant were more than accumulated; for, be&s;ides dragging a cart all the morning with loads of bread (a baker being among&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of his ma&s;ter,) he was, on ac|count of his gentle di&s;po&s;ition, the hor&s;e fixed upon to take a couple of gouty invalids in the bathing machine, after the more vigorous divers
<PB N="62" REF="123">and dippers had fini&s;hed their ablutions. In the afternoon he was harne&s;&s;ed to the London po&s;t-coach, which daily pa&s;t from Lowe&s;toft to Yarmouth. The next morning by day-break he came with the return of the &s;aid coach, and was then ready for the diurnal rotation at home, unle&s;s a more profitable offer happened to take him another way. Four years of his life were pa&s;&s;ed in this mi&s;erable round of labours, and it was at this period of his hi&s;tory he and I be|came acquainted. I was then on a vi&s;it to one of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The venciable tran&s;lator of Sophocles, E&s;chylus, and Euripides.</NOTE> be&s;t &s;cholars and men in the world; and being in want of a little hor&s;e exerci&s;e, my friend mentioned to me this poor but ho|ne&s;t &s;lave, recounting to me, at the &s;ame time, what I have now dilated of his &s;tory: adding, that he did not exactly know in what condition he might be, at that time, but that he could an&s;wer for what was left of him to be good; which is much more than can fairly be &s;aid of a third of tho&s;e who are nearly worn out in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>My affections were engaged, and I was pre|determined to make a pre&s;ent to them of this hor&s;e, for a &s;ight of which I immediately &s;ent my &s;ervant; but when he was led to the door of my friend's hou&s;e, and though my re&s;olution
<PB N="63" REF="124">to mark him for my own grew firmer as I gazed upon his pity-moving carca&s;e, I totally gave up all ideas of his utility. The owner him&s;elf, confe&s;&s;ed he was almo&s;t done up, at which thought a long &s;igh en&s;ued, and a con|fe&s;&s;ion that he had been the chief &s;upport of the family, ob&s;erving, while he patted his neck, that the poor fellow might be &s;aid not only to carry his children's bread to be &s;old, but to make it.&mdash;But it's all over with you now, my old boy&mdash;continued the baker&mdash;you may get me through the autumn, mayhap, and then&mdash; What then, &s;aid I? He mu&s;t hobble away to the kennel&mdash;To the kennel? Even &s;o, ma&s;|ter&mdash;What mu&s;t be, mu&s;t be: I can't afford to let him die by inches; and if I could, I don't &s;ee the humanity of that: better give him to the dogs while they can make a meal of him, and pay me a &s;mall matter for their enter|tainment.&mdash;He will, however, carry your ho|nour this month to come creditably.</P>
<P>Predetermined as I &s;aid to &s;pare the remains of this poor wretch, I bought him on the &s;pot, convinced that it would be difficult to find any other per&s;on who would receive him on any terms. His appearance was &s;uch as would have ju&s;tified Ro&s;inante in refu&s;ing his ac|quaintance on the etiquette of comparative poverty. The a&s;&s;ociation would have di&s;graced
<PB N="64" REF="125">that celebrated &s;pectre; nor did Quixote him&s;elf exhibit &s;o woeful a countenance. If ever, therefore, I could boa&s;t of an action purely di&s;|intere&s;ted, and which had unalloyed compa&s;|&s;ion for its ba&s;is, it was the giving five times more than he was worth, that is to &s;ay, five guineas, for this old hor&s;e; intending only, at the time, that he &s;hould pa&s;s the re&s;idue of his days in peaceful indolence, broke in upon by the infirmities of life, and die a natural death. To this end I obtained him the run of a friend's park, where I con&s;idered him as a re&s;pectable veteran retired on a pen&s;ion. In this verdant ho&s;pital he remained, un&s;ought, un&s;een, a whole year; at the end of which, being invited to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas with the noble and ge|nerous owners of the park afore&s;aid, I paid a vi&s;it al&s;o to my pen&s;ioner, who had grown &s;o much beyond him&s;elf on their unmea|&s;ured bounty, that he &s;eemed to be reno|vated. Do not wonder that I &s;carce knew him in his improvements, for he appeared not to know him&s;elf. The poor fellow's very cha|racter was inverted; the alteration reached from head to heel: he neighed, &s;norted, kick|ed, and frolicked, about the pa&s;ture, on my fir&s;t attempt to &s;top him, with the airs of a filly-foal. I reminded him that he ought to deport more humbly, con&s;idering the melan|choly
<PB N="65" REF="126">&s;ituation, from which he was but re|cently delivered; yet &s;o far from paying any attention, he turned from my morality with another &s;nort of di&s;dain, to&s;&s;ed up his &s;aucy head, and threw up his heels, wholly forget|ting, like other ingrates, his former condition. Like them too he appeared to con&s;ider the world now made for him; and, therefore, be|twixt je&s;t and earne&s;t, I was re&s;olved once more to &s;hew him he was made for the world.</P>
<P>The very next day I cau&s;ed him to be taken from his green rece&s;s, and performed the tour of the environs on his back. More airily, more plea&s;antly, I could not have been carried, nor, towards the end of the ride, more &s;oberly. The &s;pirit which he &s;hewed in the pa&s;tures was but as the levities of a hearty and happy old age in the plenitude of uncurbed lei&s;ure; like the gaiety of a veteran, who, finding him|&s;elf in health, might take it into his head to fini&s;h in a country dance; but the&s;e are &s;allies for a moment. Ah! my friend, how many poor &s;tarving wretches, worn down by their cruel ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, goaded like this hor&s;e by the "whips and &s;purs of the time," and driven out of one hard &s;ervice to another, might, like him, be re&s;cued, in the extremity, at &s;mall ex|pence, and by the hand of bounty be pro|tected
<PB N="66" REF="127">from farther rigours! even till they were renewed for a &s;erviceable, in&s;tead of a di&s;ea&s;ed, old age! How many half-fami&s;hed, hard-rid|den creatures of the human race, I &s;ay, might, in like manner, be repleni&s;hed. Reject not this long &s;tory&mdash;this epi&s;ode&mdash;this heroi-comi|epic if you plea&s;e&mdash;but I cannot allow you to call it a digre&s;&s;ion. You will admit it to be in point when you are given to under&s;tand, that on this very hor&s;e, thus re&s;tored by a little indulgence, I have mea&s;ured a thou&s;and miles, and find my a&s;&s;ociate in &s;ufficient heart to mea&s;ure a thou&s;and more. On the four-and|twentieth year of his age we &s;allied forth; and if the ma&s;ter had in cour&s;e of his travels made as few trips, as few fal&s;e &s;teps, as the &s;ervant, he might be a match for the &s;afe&s;t goer on the road of life.</P>
<P>Should this corre&s;pondence reach the pro|fe&s;&s;ional critics, think you that I &s;hould "&s;cape calumny" for taking up &s;o much of their time about an old hor&s;e? And why &s;hould I not pay an old, faithful, companion, to whom I owe much health, much happine&s;s, this grateful ef|fu&s;ion. If the Ro&s;inante of Cervantes had more wit, the cat of Montaigne more wi&s;dom, and the afs of Yorick more &s;entiment, none of them could be better qualified, as I before told
<PB N="67" REF="128">you, for a deliberate traveller. He was in &s;hort; may he is, being at this very minute at feed before me&mdash;the hor&s;e in the world for a <HI>Gleaner.</HI> A month's clo&s;e connexion and con|ver&s;e, with each other, before I &s;et out on this tour, in little experimental excur&s;ions, gave him &s;uch an in&s;ight into my habits, that we perfectly under&s;tood one another by the time we &s;et out on our northern expedition. He follows me when I wi&s;h to be a foot, waits for me, at a gate or hedge, (without tying) when I imagine there is any thing Glean-worthy, out of the main road; and when, as is my cu&s;tom, I &s;it down to make minutes of my ob&s;ervations, or luxuriate on the &s;cenery around me, al|though he has never di&s;covered any remarkable reli&s;h for the&s;e &s;ort of banquets, he contents him&s;elf with picking a dinner from the gra&s;s on the road &s;ide, or, if this <HI>agr&eacute;ment</HI> is want|ing, he takes a comfortable nap as he &s;tands, and leaves me to my reflections: after which, though often rou&s;ed &s;uddenly, he wakes in the &s;weete&s;t temper in the world, and is per|haps the only companion a traveller of my di&s;po&s;ition could go a long journey with, and not be extremely complained of: I have &s;ome|times &s;et out at early dawn with the intention of travelling, even in my &s;auntering way, at lea&s;t twenty miles, but the beauty of the day,
<PB N="68" REF="129">the abundance of the objects, and a frame of mind to enjoy them, has with diffiendty per|mitted me to reach the fir&s;t village, town, or cottage&mdash;for I &s;top any where, and am at home every where. Where is the man or woman who would find this &s;upportable? Where is even the bea&s;t who would not think it a little trouble&s;ome? I never, however, &s;aw my poor old fellow even look as if he had le&s;s patience or philo&s;ophy than my&s;elf. And &s;hall not &s;uch a hor&s;e, for once in my life, be made the chief &s;ubject of a letter? How many wor&s;e topics have filled folios? Forgive me, my friend. I would not build a palace for him were I as rich as Caligula, but I would, under your au&s;pices, dedicate to him this part of my pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, a&s;&s;uring you, if in my corre&s;|pondence, you find any &s;pirit, novelty, &s;port, or information, as you flatter me you do, the meek pliability of this aged thing had his &s;hare in producing it. As to the critics, &s;hould I come under their la&s;h for the tre&s;pa&s;s, I &s;hall only beg them, as they value their own hobby|hor&s;es, and love to prai&s;e them, to boa&s;t how well they carry, and how much &s;afer and bet|ter they go through this dirty world than their neighbours, to bear, this once, with the hi&s;tory of mine. But I promi&s;ed you another cottage
<PB N="69" REF="130">adventure, which this hi&s;tory has thus long po&s;tponed. You &s;hall have it now.</P>
<P>In effect, it was a reflection on the grote&s;que &s;ituation, to which both man and hor&s;e were reduced, that brought upon you this curious mor&s;el of eque&s;trian biography. I &s;et off from a lone hou&s;e, on a &s;andy heath, very properly called the barren i&s;land, about a mile on the Abere&s;td with &s;ide of Aberavon, where I had pa&s;&s;ed a &s;tormy night, rendered yet more troublous by there being every hour brought to the Ferry-Hou&s;e, the dead bodies of &s;i&s;her|men, who had peri&s;hed in a tempe&s;t, which a few nights before had wrecked a number of ve&s;&s;els on the coa&s;t of Wales. It was the &s;ea|&s;on of the herring fi&s;hery, in progre&s;s of which there are many misfortunes of this &s;ort, and of other kinds; for a bad &s;ea&s;on, or which is tantamount, bad luck, will ruin a whole family, &s;ometimes a whole village, the &s;ole dependence of which are the herrings, the &s;taple commodity of the inhabitants. At the time of my quitting the barren i&s;land the clouds made the faire&s;t promi&s;es, and a beautiful rainbow &s;tretched its arch acro&s;s the heavens to confirm them, but I had not gone a league, before all the&s;e fair promi&s;es were broken, and I was drenched to
<PB N="70" REF="131">the &s;kin, notwith&s;tanding my hor&s;e did the be&s;t in his power, for both our &s;akes, to pre|vent it.</P>
<P>We took &s;helter at a mo&s;t mi&s;erable looking hut, at the &s;ide of the heath, and accepted the protection it offered, with as entire good will, as if it had been an ea&s;tern palace. My hor&s;e was obliged to crawl into a kind of out|hou&s;e, where a &s;wine driver and his pigs had the in&s;tant before taken refuge, and, while I was reconciling my &s;teed to this &s;ociety, a Jew pedlar and his pack, and another traveller with his dog, crouded in. Nece&s;&s;ity, as Shak&s;peare &s;ays, brings one acquainted with &s;trange company: not that the&s;e are the words of that immortal Bard, and of cour&s;e my memory has injured even the &s;entiment: but you, who have literally his works by <HI>heart,</HI> can do him ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A being, &s;carcely human in appearance, invited me to enter the hut. I enter'd.&mdash; Its inhabitants&mdash;How &s;hall I de&s;cribe them? Fancy &s;omething, which a&s;&s;embles the ex|tremes of filth, penury, health and felicity&mdash; per&s;onify the&s;e among&s;t men, women, and children&mdash;give to each of them forms and features, which confer a &s;ort of grace and
<PB N="71" REF="132">beauty, on the hou&s;ehold of the barber of Bar|mouth by compari&s;on. Put all this filth, pe|nury, health, and felicity into motion; and having formed your groupe, imagine that you &s;ee it un&s;hod, un&s;tockinged, uncapped, and nearly unpetticoated and unbreeched. Young and old were bu&s;ied in counting the fine&s;t and fre&s;he&s;t herrings I ever &s;aw, that in&s;tant brought in from the fi&s;hing-boat. The father of the family, to whom the boat belonged, de|clared he had never had &s;o pro&s;perous a voy|age; and, though he was almo&s;t blown away, he would hazard twice as much danger for &s;uch another drag: look what a &s;ize they are of, and how they &s;hine, my boys and girls&mdash; i'faith, they &s;eem'd plaguily afraid of the hur|ricane, and came in &s;hoals to the nets as if they took &s;helter in them&mdash;little thinking, poor fools, that this was a jump from the water to the fire; and now I talk of that, here put half a dozen of them into the pan, for I am deuced hungry, and mayhap this gentleman may be &s;o too; and if &s;o be that he is, he &s;hall be as welcome to a fre&s;h herring and a brown bi&s;cuit as my&s;elf.&mdash;What &s;ay you, my heart of oak, continued he, clapping me as familiarly on the &s;houlder as if I had been his me&s;&s;mate, and indeed treating me as ho&s;pitably as if I had been &s;o, and we had both e&s;caped from a
<PB N="72" REF="133">wreck to his cabin. Perceiving my dripping &s;ituation, he &s;aid, "Come &s;hipmate, doff your jacket, put on this rug, come to an anchor in that corner, warm your &s;hivering timbers with a drop of this dear creature, which will make a dead fi&s;h &s;peak like an orator&mdash;there&mdash;another &s;wig&mdash;don't be afraid of it&mdash;one more&mdash;and now you will do while your rigging and can|va&s;s are drying.</P>
<P>All this time, mine ho&s;t of the hovel &s;tood in his &s;ea-drench'd apparel, on my reminding him of which, he cried out &s;milingly, Ah! you are a fre&s;h-water farlor, I perceive, and would take a deal of &s;ea&s;oning, before you were good for any thing; but for me, all winds and weathers are alike to old Jack, while I can get good fi&s;h abroad, and good fle&s;h at home; &s;o fry away Molly, for the wet has made me as hungry as a &s;nark, and though I have drank like a whale, I &s;hall now eat like a lion&mdash;and I hope, you will do the &s;ame, me&s;&s;-mate. By this time, mine ho&s;te&s;s &s;et before us our di&s;h of herrings, which, with oatmeal cakes, potatoes, and but|termilk, furni&s;hed one of the heartie&s;t dinners I ever ate; after which, the &s;ailor made me partaker of a can of flip&mdash;&s;ung a &s;ong, about the dangers, and hard&s;hips of the &s;ea-faring life; and made me take notice, that he was
<PB N="73" REF="134">the happy father of a cabin full of children, that I might &s;ee another was upon the &s;tocks; and that if it plea&s;ed God, to &s;end him a dozen &s;uch pieces of good fortune every year, for a dozen &s;ea&s;ons, he &s;hould be as able, as he was willing, to procure a &s;nug birth for every one; and meantime, ma&s;ter, we will have another &s;ip of grog, to drink &s;ucce&s;s to the herring fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>Our regale was interrupted by the &s;udden exclamations from without doors, of&mdash;<Q>She's lo&s;t, &s;he's lo&s;t&mdash;&s;he can't weather it&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t go to the bottom&mdash;there is not water enough for her to come in, and the wind blows like the devil in her teeth&mdash;&s;he's &s;inking&mdash;the next &s;ea will fini&s;h her.</Q> All the cottagers ran to the beach, which was within a few paces. I followed in&s;tinctively. The hurricane was again renewed, the &s;eas ran mountain high, and a &s;mall coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el was &s;truggling with them. In a few minutes the &s;trand was covered with &s;pectators, but not idle ones. The whole of the villagers hurried to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Among&s;t the croud, I di&s;|covered both the pig driver, and the pedlar, who&s;e &s;ituation, I had begun to relate to my kind hearted ho&s;t: but the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous, of the whole multitude, was a young woman, who
<PB N="74" REF="135">while the tears ran down her cheeks, was amid&s;t the fir&s;t to leap into a &s;mall boat, which had been anchored on the beach, and in which, the ma&s;ter of our cottage and three others, re|&s;olved to tru&s;t them&s;elves, to offer &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance as was in their power. The wind did not abate of its fury, but &s;hifted a few points more in-&s;hore; this, perhaps, in a ve&s;&s;el of greater burthen, might have been fatal; but was, in &s;ome &s;ort, favourable to the little bark in di&s;tre&s;s. She had, by tacking, gained a &s;ta|tion parallel to a part of the harbour, where &s;he might run a&s;hore, which &s;he did, at length, without much damage: and the only thing now to be apprehended, was the lo&s;s of the boat, that had gone out to her &s;uccour. The people on board the ve&s;&s;el, were almo&s;t in|&s;tantly on land, and one of them being &s;hewn the boat, and told, at the &s;ame time, that &s;he went out to the relief of the crew, was among&s;t the boat, and told, at the &s;ame time, that &s;he went out to the relief of the crew, was among&s;t the mo&s;t active to throw out a rope, and try to return the favour intended him in kind. The &s;ame circum&s;tance, however, which brought in the ve&s;&s;el, pre&s;ently befriended the boat, who venturing to &s;et her &s;ail, was, after a few de&s;perate rolls, impelled over the billows, and driven, as it were, headlong on &s;hore: but not before the &s;ailor, who had been handing out the rope, perceived the female in the boat,
<PB N="75" REF="136">on which he threw him&s;elf to the ground, in the eagerne&s;s of catching her in his arms. You already feel they were lovers: they were more. The bands of matrimony had united them the week before. The very fi&s;hing boat, which was now driven on &s;hore, was the mutual pro|perty of the two fathers, who had agreed to give up each his &s;hare, to their &s;on and daughter, as the wedding portion: two of the men in the little &s;kiff were the fathers: the profits of the herring &s;ea&s;on, were to be the childrens fortune. How thin are the bounds that &s;eparate the extremes of happine&s;s, from the exce&s;&s;es of mi&s;ery. The former, however, were now realized: the ve&s;&s;el brought in a good freight, the fathers were &s;aved, and the children were happy. They all re&s;ided, and were, indeed, natives of the village, but mine ho&s;t, who&s;e hou&s;e was neare&s;t to the place of landing, and had a heart &s;ufficiently expanded to fill a palace with people that &s;tood in need of ho&s;pitality, in&s;i&s;ted, that as &s;oon as the Little Sally and Jack, which, it &s;eems, was the name of the fi&s;hing-boat, could be left for half an hour, they &s;hould pa&s;s it with him: this being agreed to, all hands went to work upon the Little Sally and Jack, and if I had not been apprehen&s;ive that my ignorance in what was to be done, would rather have confu&s;ed
<PB N="76" REF="137">than a&s;&s;i&s;ted, my poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id &s;hould not have been with-hold. Matters being put to rights, and le&s;s mi&s;chief done than might have been ex|pected, the company &s;et off for the hut of my generous ho&s;t, who took a hand of each of the married lovers, walking between them, and told them, he hoped, that as they had &s;o well e&s;caped Davy's Locker this time, they would tumble in a hammock together the&s;e fifty years. A fre&s;h &s;upply of fi&s;h, was immediately ordered into the pan, my landlord, &s;wearing a terrible oath that on this occa&s;ion, (for there was a &s;trict friend&s;hip between him and the parties pre&s;erved) the old &s;aying &s;hould be verified, as to their &s;wimming thrice: accord|ingly, for their &s;econd ocean, it was deter|mined that the bowl, which, &s;ome years before, had commemorated an e&s;cape from a &s;hip|wreck in his own fortunes, &s;hould now be filled to the brim, to celebrate the &s;ucce&s;s of the Little Sally and Jack. I was pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay and take my &s;hare, on pain of being deemed too proud to be happy, among&s;t poor people, and on ob&s;erving, that my &s;teed all this time was in a &s;tate, which reproached me for faring &s;o &s;umptuou&s;ly, he &s;tarted up, declaring, that though he could not ride, he loved a hor&s;e next to a man, and that if mine would put up with a me&s;s of bran, in&s;tead
<PB N="77" REF="138">of hay, of which he had none, and a draught of ale, in&s;tead of water, he &s;hould be as wel|come as his own &s;oul. I took him at his word, and &s;taid to witne&s;s and join in the fe&s;tivities, till there was ju&s;t enough of the evening left to reach Abere&s;tdwith. I would have offered a &s;mall token of acknowledgment, for what I had received, but that I &s;aw a tre|mendous frown gathering on the brow of my ho&s;t, and an oath quivering on his lip, which frightened me from my de&s;ign, and made me only take his hand, with an a&s;&s;urance, that I would never pa&s;s his hou&s;e without &s;topping, to &s;ee if all was well on board, and how the her|ring fi&s;hery &s;ucceeded. This &s;o plea&s;ed him, that he made the bowl go around to my health, and wi&s;hing another gale of wind would blow me into his hovel, as often as I &s;hould come along &s;ide of it; then led out my hor&s;e, held my &s;tirrup while I mounted, and huzza'd me in three hearty cheers, till I was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>My dear friend, how fallacious, how con|tracted, are our judgments on that part of human nature, which we have not had oppor|tunities of &s;eeing, and which, therefore, we too often &s;uppo&s;e does not exi&s;t. We lay much of what are called, the courte&s;ies, civilities, and
<PB N="78" REF="139">intere&s;ting humanities, to the account of edu|cation: we conceive, that to enlarge the human heart, we &s;hould refine it: in &s;hort, we are ex|tremely apt to circum&s;cribe elevated action, to elevated life; or at be&s;t, to con&s;ider the nobler effu&s;ions, when they proceed from low born, and uncultured men, as exceptions to a ge|neral &s;ordidne&s;s, and vulgar way of <HI>feeling,</HI> as well as thinking. You will not &s;u&s;pect me of an overfondne&s;s, for what is termed low com|pany: the error of my life, perhaps, is to have pa&s;t too much of it in the &s;ociety of what is called high company; for what, commonly &s;peaking, does it &s;hew us, but the &s;mooth &s;hil|lings, that Sterne has &s;o finely de&s;cribed, as rubbing out all character and impre&s;&s;ion, in the act of poli&s;hing? I love, however, to mix with, and as it were, blend my&s;elf, in all ranks and orders of men&mdash;to &s;ee, conver&s;e with, and weave my&s;elf into their mo&s;t familiar habi|tudes; and as I never yet could bring any other per&s;on exactly into the &s;ame way of thinking, I have pur&s;ued this inclination for the mo&s;t part <HI>alone,</HI> till, by long u&s;age, &s;olitary travelling, though I tru&s;t you will allow me to be of a &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition, is become agree|able to me. And &s;uffer me to &s;ay, that I think I have derived from this very &s;ingularity, a more thorough in&s;ight into nature, the hearts
<PB N="79" REF="140">and manners of human kind, than if I had gone the grand tour, in what is denominated the <HI>be&s;t company.</HI> By means of my humbler, but le&s;s encumbered, mode of travelling, I am as free to ob&s;erve what is pa&s;&s;ing, as the birds that fly over my head: like them, I &s;top to amu&s;e my&s;elf with a &s;ong, regale my&s;elf with gleaning what I feel to be &s;olid food, but which grew up in places, where another tra|veller would not go to look for it: like them, I enjoy the blazing hearth, and partake the crumbs of the pea&s;ant, or pau&s;e to ob&s;erve upon the magnificence, and luxuries of the prince. I pa&s;s in rapid tran&s;itions, from one to the other. In a circuitous way, revi&s;it the places I have left, renew my acquaintance with particular per&s;ons and places, glean the charac|ters, and hearts, of the poor and the rich, break in upon them unawares, open the path, by no former notices, which gives folks time, to put on the ma&s;k of the world, and receive me in di&s;gui&s;e.&mdash;I love to take them by &s;urprize, and &s;o di&s;cover my welcome. It delights me, to lift the latch of a cottage, (&s;uch, for in&s;tance, as I have been de&s;cribing) towards night-fall, and to &s;ee the hearts of the inhabitants fly out &s;uddenly to greet me. And to treat my friends in higher life, in like manner&mdash;to &s;teal into their familiar, family rooms, unexpectedly,
<PB N="80" REF="141">and almo&s;t un&s;een; at hours they are mo&s;t likely to be gathered together. When a year's ab&s;ence is expected, it delights me to cut it &s;hort; &s;ometimes to cut it in half&mdash;&s;ometimes, even in quarters.&mdash;Can there be any thing more plea&s;ant to the traveller, who has, luckily&mdash;
<Q>"The world before him where to choo&s;e,"</Q> than to &s;ee the countenances of a whole fa|mily, of whatever condition, and of whatever country; for what points or boundaries of earth or water can &s;et limits to a temper that cultivates the kind, the good, and the ingeni|ous, wherever it meets them?&mdash;to &s;ee, I &s;ay, the countenances of &s;uch lighten up at your &s;udden appearance, and each per&s;on contri|buting to your welcome&mdash;one offering "the ready chair," another refre&s;hment, &amp;c. &amp;c. and thus, as I &s;aid, feeling your&s;elf at home with the worthy, and ho&s;pitable, in all countries. I prote&s;t to you that I bear a good-will, bor|dering on friend&s;hip, for even the trees, or hedge-rows, that have formerly afforded me &s;hade in &s;ummer, or &s;helter, &s;uch as they had to be&s;tow, in winter, and I do not pa&s;s them bye, in my returns, without a &s;mile, and &s;ome|times a nod of acknowledgment.</P>

No. You have too much philo&s;ophy, too much toleration, too much affection, about you, not to let every man amu&s;e him&s;elf, in his travels through life, in his own way; and with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, you would be in friend|&s;hip with the mo&s;t inanimate objects&mdash;with a clown that opened the door of his hut to me (but for an hour) amid&s;t the Appenines, to lighten the toils of a&s;cending them, or with the &s;imple&s;t &s;hrubs that &s;aved me, but a minute, from the "pitile&s;s &s;torm" in the de&s;erts of Arabia.</P>

<P>There is a beautiful &s;entiment, &s;omewhere in Shen&s;tone's pro&s;e volume, which purports, that he never ca&s;ts his eye over a &s;pacious map, but he fancies in &s;uch and &s;uch countries are numberle&s;s amiable per&s;ons he would like to know, and concludes, with a &s;igh of regret,
<PB N="84" REF="145">that it is impo&s;&s;ible he ever &s;hould.

Whatever, therefore, you were before, I &s;et you down from this moment, as a convert to re&s;identiary travelling: and, moreover, whenever you next examine your map, to trace the wanderings of your corre&s;pondent, you will be plea&s;ed to know, what you certainly did not know before, that upon the &s;ide of a barren heath, at the edge of a roaring i&s;ea, be|tween Aberavon and Abered&s;twith, there &s;tands a &s;olitary hut, which would open to di&s;tre&s;s, as readily as to pro&s;perity, and afford its im|partial bounty, to who&s;oever is in want of it. Ah, that truth would warrant our &s;aying &s;o much in prai&s;e of half the hou&s;es, that have the mo&s;t room to &s;pare, and the be&s;t accom|modation to be&s;tow, in the great city of Lon|don, or any other great city! but, as Cooper &s;ays, very &s;weetly, though, perhaps, a little quaintly,&mdash;
<Q>"God made the country, and man made the town."</Q>
<PB N="85" REF="146">After all, there are good people every where, if we take the trouble to look for them; and to expect them without trouble, or re&s;earch, in a world like this, is prepo&s;terous.

<HEAD>TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Abered&s;twith.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TRUE, my friend, I plead guilty to your accu&s;ation of &s;ilence: it has been a whole month &s;ince I la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed you; but I under|&s;tood by yours, which came to hand &s;oon after mine was di&s;patched, that you were in your bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and that heavy grief, for the lo&s;s of one of the earlie&s;t adopted, and mo&s;t dearly loved, of your friends occa&s;ioned it. I have the mo&s;t rooted di&s;like to interrupt, or to be interrupted, in the awful duties and inclin|ings of di&s;tre&s;s on the&s;e occa&s;ions. It is u&s;ual, I know, to write a very long epi&s;tle of condo|lence, and con&s;olation on &s;uch ca&s;es: but did not the intention &s;anctify the practice, I &s;hould pronounce it impertinent, if not impious. It is obtruding upon our &s;orrow in its &s;abbath. One whom we have long valued, long conver&s;ed with, will be &s;een by us in this world no more; the day that bereaves us, and the days of mourning that &s;ucceed it, &s;hould be kept holy. It &s;hould be hallowed with our tears. Such tears often "do us good," or, at wor&s;t, they do us le&s;s harm, than an unrea&s;onable attempt to wipe them away. And &s;uch efforts, are al|ways
<PB N="87" REF="148">more or le&s;s ineffectual: the eloquence of Cicero, cloathing the morality of Seneca, would neither reach our hearts, nor convince our un|der&s;tandings, under the recent impre&s;&s;ions of grief, for the death of a long tried, and long loved friend. The ordinary applications are packs of proverbs, and &s;trings of maxims, which tell us what we know to be true, and <HI>impracticable.</HI> Had I in&s;ulted you with any of the&s;e, I &s;hould have di&s;honoured both the liv|ing and the dead. I am not to learn, that you have "the virtue to be moved," and, that her you mourn, had a double claim on your ten|der regret&mdash;her own admirable qualities, and her veneration for yours.</P>
<P>As there is a point, however, beyond which &s;orrow &s;hould not pa&s;s, &s;o is there one that &s;hould bound the &s;alutary &s;ilence of a friend. That point is, methinks, arrived to you, and to my&s;elf. Your favour, by the po&s;t of ye&s;ter|day, convinces me&mdash;
<Q><L>"Di&s;cretion hath &s;o far fought with Nature,</L>
<L>"That you with <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> &s;orrow think on her;</L>
<L>"Together with remembrance of your&s;elf."</L></Q> Your ob&s;ervation, that there was a re&s;emblance betwixt me and the decea&s;ed, in the con&s;truction of our minds, or, at lea&s;t, in the formation of our ta&s;te, is extremely flattering; particularly, in
<PB N="88" REF="149">an hour like this, when you have been, as it were, embalming the qualities, that mo&s;t plea&s;ed you in the latter, with your tears. I remem|ber, you was formerly of this opinion. The difference of our ages made nothing again&s;t the &s;imilitude of our &s;pirits. The few days I pa&s;&s;ed in the company of this &s;econd De l'Enclos, at your hou&s;e, in the winter of &mdash; were among&s;t the few that hurried away from life, without feeling one moment too long. Shall we ever forget the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;ympa|thy, that by an involuntary impul&s;e threw us into each other's embraces, on our di&s;covery, that we both held long conver&s;ations with our|&s;elves, and as regularly went on with que&s;tion and an&s;wer, as if we had been in the heat of debate, in a room full of company? You re|member, likewi&s;e, I tru&s;t, our &s;atisfaction on finding, that we had been both &s;et down, for people out of their wits, by the&mdash;
<Q>"Sly, flow things, with circum&s;pective eyes."</Q> and that we &s;hould both de&s;cend to the grave, with the <HI>reputation</HI> of having been di&s;tracted: that is to &s;ay, having had the power of extract|ing &s;weets, from tho&s;e flowery trifles, which others, who are as plea&s;ed with trifles, not a whit better them&s;elves, reckon among&s;t the weeds of life.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="150">Her journey to the tomb of her grand|mother, from who&s;e bounty &s;he had received many valuable things, and from who&s;e pious conduct in life, the rich legacy of a virtuous example, is never to quit either your memory, or mine, my dear friend. The di&s;tance be|twixt the &s;pot where &s;he her&s;elf liv'd, and that where her venerable ance&s;tor was buried, the difficulties &s;he encountered on the way, and the plea&s;ure of accompli&s;hing her purpo&s;e, were all circum&s;tances to intere&s;t her excellent heart: but, how was this plea&s;ure augmented, by the little adventures &s;he met with in the village, where the bones of this amiable rela|tive were depo&s;ited. Her own eloquent man|ner of relating is nece&s;&s;ary, to give the portrait of both the cau&s;e and effect, on that occa&s;ion. The face and figure, over which, Beauty's great de&s;troyer, Time, could gain but a partial and imperfect victory, &s;hould be before you, to feel the fulne&s;s of her happine&s;s, on her hearing from the whole neighbourhood, who had her in remembrance, a long detail of the worthie&s;t, kinde&s;t actions. She made the tour of the vil|lage, and in almo&s;t every hou&s;e, &s;aw or heard of &s;omething, to make her proud that &s;he &s;prung&mdash;
<Q><L>"From unattainted blood,</L>
<L>"And claim'd a <HI>birthright</HI> to be good."</L></Q>
<PB N="90" REF="151">What, indeed, mu&s;t have been the tran&s;port of a mind like her's, on gathering from one poor family, that to the decea&s;ed, they owed their pre&s;ervation from a pri&s;on; from another, the portion of a daughter; from a third, a timely re&s;cue from the jaws of poverty, and &s;o on in benevolent &s;ucce&s;&s;ions? This village, too, was the abode of her early days. How vivid were the pictures &s;he drew of her revi&s;itation, to the &s;cenes, which had made upon a &s;u&s;ceptible heart, the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and which half a century's ab&s;ence had not power to impair. Like a lover, faithful to his fir&s;t affections, &s;he told us, you know, how &s;he &s;aluted many of the green lanes, allies, and old inhabitants as friends, for whom, though long parted, &s;he re|tained a kind remembrance: &s;he paid parti|cular re&s;pect to the yews that &s;haded her rela|tion's grave, and had a long interview with &s;ome elms, now grown into &s;tately trees, which were of her own planting: &s;he called them her children, and told them, &s;he rejoiced to &s;ee them do well in the world, and pro&s;per.</P>
<P>But that, which had more magic for me on this occa&s;ion, was, I confe&s;s, the very points, which your very &s;ober, &s;en&s;ical people, who are vain of their rationality, would be the lea&s;t &s;atisfied with&mdash;the romantic means &s;he
<PB N="91" REF="152">u&s;ed to bring this journey of her heart to bear. Nothing could favour it more&mdash;even a writer of romances could not, than the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the re&s;ident clergyman of the village, who, in an&s;wer to her letter of enquiry, re&s;pecting the po&s;&s;ibility of a few days accommodation, and de&s;cribing the motives, &s;ent her a pre&s;&s;ing, and, indeed, irre&s;i&s;tible invitation to his own hou&s;e, a&s;&s;uring her at the &s;ame time, that him&s;elf, and every part of his family, entered &s;o cordially into the virtu|ous &s;pirit of her intended adventure, that they were de&s;irous to give it every encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, begging her, withal, to remember, that the moment &s;he entered the Par&s;onage of &mdash;, &s;he was at <HI>home,</HI> becau&s;e, wherever there is <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> there is <HI>natural affection,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, (though per&s;onal &s;trangers before,) they meet on the terms of near relations, whom a wi&s;er and better Director, than Chance, has at la&s;t brought together.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t grand point being thus carried, and &s;o much in her own way, the re&s;t was of no difficult attainment, for though, Mr. L. S. her hu&s;band, is a man of the world, and well knows how to traffic with it, the &s;pirit of trade had not &s;o far ab&s;orbed the &s;pirit of con|jugal love, as to ob&s;truct any innocent di&s;po&s;i|tional
<PB N="92" REF="153">impul&s;e his wife wi&s;hed to follow. The Quixoti&s;m before mentioned, indeed, ap|peared to him carrying the joke too far, and it was no ea&s;y matter, to make him believe the fair Quixote &s;erious. His rea&s;oning upon it was &s;o characteri&s;tic of the man of bu&s;ine&s;s, that it formed the fine&s;t contra&s;t to the ideas, and expectations, of the woman of genius.</P>
<P>What! my dear, take a journey of an hun|dred miles, to vi&s;it the grave of your grand|mother!&mdash;Write a long rig-me-role epi&s;tle, (which, I dare &s;ay, is very fine, and all that,) to a man you never &s;aw! Why, what &s;ort of an&s;wer can you expect? Depend on it, the gentleman will &s;et you down as a mad-wo|man and &s;o write you no an&s;wer at all.</P>
<P>And when the an&s;wer did come, all I can &s;ay is, added Mr. L. S. he is as mad as you. Go by all means, continued he, heartily laugh|ing in a good humoured manner; pray go, wi&s;e, for 'tis pity two hou&s;es &s;hould part you.

<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, my highly endowed and, highly-re|&s;pected friend, I may, all this time, have been forcing <HI>you</HI> out of the path of your contem|plations into mine; but I had a better motive for it than mo&s;t intruders can give; and, I tru&s;t, my de&s;ign is in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered. <HI>Our</HI> de&s;ires and aver&s;ions, you know, are for the mo&s;t part the &s;ame.

<HEAD>LETTER IX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Abere&s;idwith.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS town is neither good nor bad. The &s;treets are beyond compari&s;on the dirtie&s;t I ever &s;aw, a proof of which is their being at this moment indicted by the inhabitants. No wonder, therefore, if &s;trangers complain. In|deed, they mu&s;t be rugged and unplea&s;ant at all times, for the country here is flat, &s;toney, and rugged. The environs are neither barren nor fertile, and the only walks, or in truth <HI>walkable</HI> places, are tho&s;e at the end of the town, round the ruined ca&s;tle, another, round the church-yard, and another, very &s;hort one, by the &s;ide of the harbour. The beach is im|pa&s;&s;able, and the bathing places difficult and unchearful. In fine, it is in almo&s;t all re&s;pects the rever&s;e of Barmouth, except that it has the advantage in the number of hou&s;es, and of cour&s;e in the company. I &s;hould not have thought any thing here worth mentioning, had it not been to give you a few hints by way of directory, not to let the greater popula|rity of this place draw you from the other (Barmouth) where your bath will be more
<PB N="101" REF="162">comfortable, and your <HI>agr&eacute;mens,</HI> from the &s;ur|rounding objects, out of all compari&s;on what|ever.</P>
<P>For want of other allurements, I cho&s;e this place, to throw together the ob&s;ervations that were &s;cattered about my note-book, re&s;pecting certain cu&s;toms, u&s;ages, and a variety of other things, it may be proper for a traveller to be apprized of, particularly the articles of <HI>expen|diture.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it is a &s;ettled u&s;age, and cu&s;tom, throughout the principality, for the trading part of the people to over-reach you in your little marketings, or bargains, with them; that is to &s;ay, they will a&s;k all &s;trangers, of genteel appearance, about a third more than they would a&s;k a native or countryman; but even allowing this, you will have almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;aries, and mo&s;t of the luxuries of life, at lea&s;t, by a third cheaper than (with very few exceptions) the cheape&s;t parts of England: at fir&s;t you may put up with a little extortion, which will dimini&s;h, as you become re&s;identiary. All places, as they get into reputation for any beauty or convenience, and are, therefore, the re&s;orts of people that, &s;ince they can afford to travel, are &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="102" REF="163">be wealthy, grow dear, at fir&s;t imperceptibly, till, in a few years, that commodity, which you could procure for &s;ixpence, is not to be ob|tained for a &s;hilling, and &s;o on in proportion. This is remarkably verified in Wales; ground, hou&s;e-rent, and the nece&s;&s;aries of life, are &s;o much rai&s;ed in price, &s;ince my fir&s;t tour of this country about twelve years ago, that were not the fact univer&s;ally admitted, I &s;hould be afraid you would &s;u&s;pect me of profiting by the licence <HI>expected</HI> to be taken by travellers, were I to mention the comparative difference betwixt that time, and the pre&s;ent, in both North and South Wales.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, a good oeconomi&s;t might, in the family way, even at the pre&s;ent day, make one hundred pounds tell in this country to three hundred in any other belonging, pro|perly, to England: I here &s;peak, however, of comparative prices in the &s;maller towns, and villages; in the cities, the e&s;timate mu&s;t be about two to one in favour of Wales. In Caer|marthen and Caernarvon, for example, the one a principal town to the &s;outhward, the other northward, you get fi&s;h, fowl, butcher's meat, eggs, bacon, and firing, (certainly the grand articles in dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment) on an average, at the following rates:

</TABLE> In little villages higher up the country, both ways, the cheapne&s;s, for want of a market, is &s;till more extraordinary; if we except the re|mote places of England, near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and certain parts of Cornwall and York&s;hire, this &s;tatement, which you may depend on it, is the correct re&s;ult of re&s;identiary remark, will convince you that this principality is not more abundantly &s;upplied with the ornamental than the u&s;eful: and that, as tho&s;e who have ta&s;te, fortune, and talents could not be more gratified in vi&s;iting it on the &s;core of romantic beauty, they, who found it expedient to re|trench, to narrow their e&s;tabli&s;hment, and yet to dimini&s;h none of the comforts to which they
<PB N="104" REF="165">have been accu&s;tomed, could not, any where, find a more peaceful, plentiful, and healthy re|treat: With this additional <HI>agr&eacute;ment,</HI> that al|mo&s;t all places are &s;o &s;urrounded by good neighbours, and there is really a di&s;po&s;itional, as well as hereditary ho&s;pitality, among&s;t the native gentry, that a new &s;ettler never need to be in want of agreeable &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t upon this, the rather, as it is not more the chimera of per&s;ons of genius, going into foreign countries for fine &s;cenery, than it is for people of &s;mall or broken fortunes, to gather the wrecks of their property, and carry them <HI>abroad,</HI> on the fal&s;e &s;uper&s;tition that they may there &s;ooner <HI>repair their ruins,</HI> and, as it were, rebuild them&s;elves and families, than in any parts of the Briti&s;h dominion. I mu&s;t own that, although I have travelled too much, not to have rubbed off all the little, or great, national prejudices, that cling to my hone&s;t friend <HI>John Bull,</HI> and although, I have had abundant rea&s;on to prove, that Providence has been far more equal in its indulgences to all the inhabi|tants of the globe, than &s;tay-at-home people can ever be made to believe, I am Engli&s;hman enough to adopt that &s;entiment of a brother wanderer, which advi&s;es us not to &s;pend more money out of our own country, than is nece&s;|&s;ary.
<PB N="105" REF="166">Methinks, indeed, it is but fair to give our own country the preference, where advan|tages are, at lea&s;t, equal. If, for example, a fa|mily finds an arrangement in London, or any of the provincial towns, no longer &s;upportable, and can accompli&s;h all the objects of a change of place, as well at the end of two hundred, as two thou&s;and miles, I humbly conceive, that the &s;horte&s;t cut to the land of oeconomy is the be&s;t; in which, the good old maxim of choo&s;ing the lea&s;t of two evils, is confirmed by common &s;en&s;e. Should any of your friends, therefore, henceforward, find &s;uch retirements worth looking after, they may be found in almo&s;t any part of the principality, north or &s;outh, two hundred miles from the Briti&s;h capital, and if the other hundred is added, the expence of making it, would, in the end, be well repaid by the beauty of the country, and the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of provi&s;ions. Hou&s;e rent is, likewi&s;e, a very important article. A friend of mine oc|cupied an exceeding large, well furni&s;hed hou&s;e, &s;ufficient for his numerous family, and had more than enough of garden and orchard ground, to &s;upply it with vegetables and fruits, and pa&s;turage for a couple of hor&s;es and a cow, at the yearly rent of 25l. a year, free of taxes. I &s;aw many others on a &s;maller &s;cale at 15l. and 20l. unfurni&s;hed hou&s;es, with
<PB N="106" REF="167">land enough to pay a con&s;iderable part of the rent, and re&s;erves for your own u&s;e, may be had in the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ituations at a pro|portionate rate. You will plea&s;e to note, that this is not meant as a character of partial places, but as general information, with re&s;pect to the whole country.</P>
<P>The exceptions to the rule are made not &s;o much by the people of Wales, as tho&s;e of Eng|land and Ireland; the imprudence of whom I &s;hall enlarge on in its place. At pre&s;ent, I &s;hall content my&s;elf by ob&s;erving, that when they have lo&s;t their e&s;tates, it would be well for them, if they could contrive to lo&s;e the folly by which their in&s;olvency was produced. But, unfortunately, that prodigal &s;pirit which at|tended them in affluent, accompanies them in &s;lender circum&s;tances; and wherever they go for refuge, they carry their expen&s;ive ideas, and habits, along with them, ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ing, they can reconcile their former notions with their pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy, as if, like a per|&s;on in a fever, they imagined a cure could be performed by merely changing their po&s;ture. A great deal more is nece&s;&s;ary in a family re|form, than quitting the haunt of its former fol|lies or misfortunes. They come into a new country, find it rea&s;onable, take the fir&s;t op|portunity
<PB N="107" REF="168">to play off their pride again&s;t their poverty, &s;hew the people they mix with, that they &s;till wi&s;h to be looked on as per&s;onages of di&s;tinction; boa&s;t of what fortunes they have already &s;quandered, and what they can &s;till afford to lavi&s;h; put the natives fir&s;t upon ex|tortion, furni&s;hing them with the <HI>hint</HI> to cheat, and then, but too late, quarrel with them for <HI>taking</HI> it. Thus, deep play, late hours, and every exce&s;s of London and Dublin, are, at the time I am now writing, together with clubs, and other town-bred luxuries, in the <HI>high ton of folly</HI> in many places, where the in|habitants grow rich and rogui&s;h by &s;upplying them. I extremely di&s;like per&s;onality, or could give you no incon&s;iderable catalogue of ru&s;tic gaming hou&s;es, White's, Brookes's, &amp;c. in the very heart of Cambria. In as much, there|fore, as they have degenerated from the &s;im|plicity of ancient manners, and from the ho|ne&s;ty of ancient maxims, into the <HI>refinements</HI> of the world, on which we &s;o much pique our|&s;elves, the fault is originally our own, and we mu&s;t take the con&s;equences. Luxury is a wide &s;preading evil, my friend, and &s;oon pa&s;&s;es from one country to another, making pro&s;elytes as it goes. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf it has travelled into this country, and has its votaries in the moun|tains. They contain more than one farmer,
<PB N="108" REF="169">who, in imitation of his Engli&s;h brothers of the plough, keeps his pair of geldings for the chace, and a &s;ide-&s;addle pad for the lady of the dairy, who feathers her cap with the fine&s;t of the farmers wives and daughters, whom we have &s;een at the rural a&s;&s;emblies &mdash; and &mdash;, acting the characters of duche&s;&s;es, for that night only. Although &s;ome twenty years back, when the town had not quite journeyed &s;o far into the north country Welch-ward, at lea&s;t the&s;e new|made gentry were contented to trudge on foot ten or a dozen miles, after the duties of the morning were over, to a ru&s;tic hop, at the &s;ummons of a blind harper, and the dames and dam&s;els thought them&s;elves well off if they could get into one of the carts, or mount by pairs on the back of one of the cart-hor&s;es, to give the Corydons of the hills the meet|ing. The corruption &s;tops not at amu&s;ement: it extends to bu&s;ine&s;s; the fir&s;t mu&s;t be &s;up|plied by the la&s;t; but, as this cannot be done in the way of ordinary, it mu&s;t be effected by extraordinary means. Supernumerary hor&s;es, dre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. are not to be maintained at the old market profits: the&s;e, though equivalent to the nece&s;&s;aries, are inadequate to the luxu|ries of life; and luxuries once indulged, &s;oon become nece&s;&s;aries; for where is the male &s;wain that having, as it were, <HI>flown</HI> over the
<PB N="109" REF="170">mountains on a hunter, will &s;toop again to <HI>creep</HI> over them on "Dobbin, or the foundered mare?" or the female, who will, for the &s;ake of oeconomy, di&s;mount her feathers, and ex|change again the glaring folly of her &s;hewy at|tire, for her wheel of cottage indu&s;try,
<Q>"and robes of country brown?"</Q> It is out of the nature of plea&s;ingly pernicious effects to expect it: <HI>ergo,</HI> the price of their commodities mu&s;t be rai&s;ed: and it is but rea|&s;onable, that as we occa&s;ioned the folly, we &s;hould contribute to its &s;upport.</P>
<P>As we advance, however, into the interior parts of the country, and the farther from the route of modi&s;h travellers, always the better&mdash; as we get more into tho&s;e unfrequented places, from whence "the &s;ober wi&s;hes" of the inhabi|tants have "not learned to &s;tray," and where none but literary and gleaning travellers delight to explore, we find this hardy and happy race of people rejoicing, like their country, in the &s;imple&s;t charms of nature; and Mr. Gray, who made a philo&s;ophical tour of Wales, you know, mu&s;t have had numberle&s;s living rea&s;ons, in the cour&s;e of it, to exclaim&mdash;
<Q><L>"Since ignorance is bli&s;s,</L>
<L>"'Tis folly to be wi&s;e!"</L></Q>
<PB N="110" REF="171">and to &s;ee the &s;entiment brought to the te&s;t, truth indeed warrants our carrying the &s;entiment much farther; for in this ca&s;e the wi&s;dom of the world is wor&s;e than fooli&s;hne&s;s: it is knavery, and we may rather cry out with Ad|di&s;on&mdash;
<Q><L>"If knowledge of the world mu&s;t make men vicious,</L>
<L>"May pea&s;ants ever live in ignorance!"</L></Q> I have &s;een groupes of poor people in the &s;e|que&s;tered &s;pots of both North and South Wales, &s;porting among&s;t the precipices, or in the glens, with a "content &s;o ab&s;olute," as to look on any objects le&s;s in a &s;tate of nature than them&s;elves as unwelcome: at the &s;ight of an unexpected man of the world, they will run from him into a rocky cavity, like a rabbit into its hole, or plunge into the thicke&s;t &s;hade of the valley, as if they were e&s;caping from a bea&s;t of prey. Were they to know what a &s;naky train of pa&s;|&s;ions are probably folded up in the bo&s;om of that well-dre&s;&s;ed worldling, which never crept into their brea&s;ts, they would often have rea&s;on to believe he was the mo&s;t dangerous mon&s;ter they could encounter, and double their dili|gence to avoid him.</P>
<P>And here, among&s;t the u&s;ages and cu&s;toms, I mu&s;t not omit to inform you, that what you have, perhaps, often heard without believing&mdash;
<PB N="111" REF="172">re&s;pecting the <HI>mode of court&s;hip,</HI> among&s;t the Welch pea&s;ants, is true. The lower order of people, do actually carry on their love affairs in bed, and what would extremely a&s;toni&s;h more poli&s;hed lovers, they are carried on ho|nourably, it being, at lea&s;t, as u&s;ual, for the pa&s;tora's of the mountains to go from the bed of court&s;hip to the bed of marriage, as unpol|luted and maidenly as the Chloes of fa&s;hion; and yet, you are not to conclude this proceeds from their being le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of the <HI>belle pa&s;&s;ion</HI> than their betters: or, that the cold air, which they breathe has "froze the genial cur|rent of their &s;ouls." By no means; if they cannot boa&s;t the voluptuous languors of an Italian &s;ky, they glow with the bracing &s;pirit of a more invigorating atmo&s;phere. I really took &s;ome pains to inve&s;tigate this curious cu&s;tom, and after being a&s;&s;ured by many, of its veracity, had an opportunity of atte&s;ting its ex|i&s;tence with my own eyes. The &s;ervant maid of the family I vi&s;ited in Caernarvon&s;hire, hap|pened to be the object of a young pea&s;ant, who walked eleven long miles every &s;unday morn|ing, to favour his &s;uit, and regularly returned the &s;ame night through all weathers, to be ready for monday's employment in the fields, being &s;imply a day labourer. He u&s;ually ar|rived in time for morning &s;ervice, which he
<PB N="112" REF="173">con&s;tantly attended, after which he e&s;corted his Dulcinea home to the hou&s;e of her ma&s;ter, by who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion they as con&s;tantly pa&s;t the &s;ucceeding hour in bed, according to the cu&s;tom of the country. The&s;e tender &s;abba|tical preliminaries continued without any in|terruption near two years, when the treaty of alliance was &s;olemnized; and &s;o far from any breach of articles happening in the intermediate time, it is mo&s;t likely that it was con&s;idered by both parties as a matter of cour&s;e, without exciting any other idea. On &s;peaking to my friend on the &s;ubject, he ob&s;erved that, though it certainly appeared a dangerous mode of mak|ing love, he had &s;een &s;o few <HI>living</HI> abu&s;es of it, during &s;ix and thirty years re&s;idence in that county, where it, neverthele&s;s, had always, more or le&s;s, prevailed, he mu&s;t con|clude it was as innocent as any other.&mdash; One proof of its being <HI>thought</HI> &s;o by the par|ties, is the perfect ea&s;e and freedom with which it is done, no aukwardne&s;s or confu&s;ion appear|ing on either &s;ide; the mo&s;t well-behaved and decent young women giving into it without a blu&s;h, and they are by no means deficient in mode&s;ty. What is pure in idea is always &s;o in conduct, &s;ince bad actions are the common con&s;equence of ill thoughts; and though the better &s;ort of people treat this ceremony as a
<PB N="113" REF="174">barbari&s;m, it is very much to be doubted whe|ther more <HI>faux pas</HI> have been committed by the Cambrian boors in this <HI>free acce&s;s</HI> to the bed chambers of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, than by more fa&s;hionable Strephons and their nymphs, near
<Q>"Dimpled brook and fountain brim."</Q> in groves and &s;hady bowers. The power of habit is, perhaps, &s;tronger than the power of pa&s;&s;ion, or even than of the charms which in&s;pire it; and it is &s;ufficient, almo&s;t, to &s;ay a thing is the <HI>cu&s;tom of a country</HI> to clear it from any re|proach that would attach to an innovation. Were it the practice of a few only, and to be gratified by &s;tealth, there would, from the &s;trange con&s;truction of human nature, be more cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion; but being ancient, general, and carried on without difficulty, it is, probably as little dangerous as a tete-a-tete in a drawing|room, or in any other full-dre&s;s place, where young people meet to &s;ay &s;oft things to each other. A moon-light walk in Papa's garden, where Mi&s;s &s;teals out to meet her lover <HI>again&s;t the con&s;ent of her parents,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, ex|tremely agreeable to the young people, has ten times the peril.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the cu&s;toms that had peculiar at|tractions for me, was the tender veneration paid, externally at lea&s;t, to the dead; the
<PB N="114" REF="175">church-yards being kept with an attentive decen|cy, we, in vain, look for in many other countries. There is &s;omething extremely &s;imple and plea|&s;ing in the <HI>idea,</HI> as well as in the practice, of &s;trewing flowers and evergreens over the graves of departed friends and relations. Every Sa|turday, &s;ome of the &s;urvivors, perform the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed duty at the family grave. This con|fi&s;ts in clearing it of all weeds, repairing the mould, dre&s;&s;ing the verdure, mending the little fences of white tiles or &s;hells that &s;urround it, and, in &s;hort, putting it in order again&s;t the Sabbath; then the whole pari&s;h are to be eye witne&s;&s;es of the pious cares of each other: I have &s;een graves &s;o diligently cultured, that it has every week been planted with the choice&s;t flowers of the &s;ea&s;on; others have been orna|mented with the more permanent &s;hrubs, and the little hillocks, &s;acred to infants have, lite|rally, be&s;towed on them
<Q>"All the incen&s;e of the breathing Spring."</Q></P>
<P>Several good purpo&s;es are an&s;wered hereby, I will recount &s;ome of them to you in the words of a Pembroke&s;hire widow, whom I lately &s;aw decorating the graves of her hu&s;|band and a child, their fir&s;t born, who died in the &s;ame year. The following is a faithful copy of our conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Your employment mu&s;t be very intere&s;ting to you.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="176">It is our way in the&s;e parts, Sir. Some think it a trouble: I have no plea&s;ure now that equals it, yet I am &s;ure to have wet eyes all the time it is doing.</P>
<P>The relations then, at who&s;e graves you are performing this &s;adly plea&s;ing duty, mu&s;t needs have been very near and dear to you.</P>
<P>They could not be more &s;o. This was the be&s;t hu&s;band, and the mo&s;t hone&s;t man in Wales, and the ro&s;es and violets, which I have ju&s;t been &s;etting at the head and feet of this grave, are not &s;weeter or prettier, than the poor little girl who lies under them. But they are in a better place, and I ought to be happy, and &s;o I am.</P>
<P>Here &s;he wept very bitterly.</P>
<P>I &s;ee yonder, an old man entering the church-yard, with a large bundle of young plants, which he can &s;carce carry.</P>
<P>That man is in his ninety third year, and has buried all his family: the la&s;t was a grand&s;on, to who&s;e grave he is now going, and which he will make like a garden before he leaves it.

<P><PB N="116" REF="177">Then he was the favourite of the family: as the la&s;t and younge&s;t, perhaps, he was the poor old man's Benjamin.</P>
<P>On the contrary, he lov'd him the lea&s;t, and &s;ome think, that an unlucky blow given by the old man was the cau&s;e of the young one's death, but it cannot be proved, &s;o he e&s;capes, but by his care about the poor young fellow's grave, our townfolk imagine his con&s;cience &s;mites him: though, for that matter, we all dre&s;s our dead here, whether we love or hate them, it is quite a &s;candal to let a Sa|turday pa&s;s, without making every grave as clean as our&s;elves for the Sabbath.</P>
<P>It is a very commendable cu&s;tom, and I wi&s;h with all my heart, it were adopted in England, where, too generally &s;peaking, the repo&s;i|taries of the dead are &s;hockingly violated. Hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep, are often &s;uffered to feed upon the grave; nay, the par&s;on him&s;elf frequently turns his pad to fatten on his de|cea&s;ed pari&s;hioners.

<P><PB N="117" REF="178">And as to cleanline&s;s, in other re&s;pects, that article &s;o properly an object of your care, is very rarely attended to with us. The weeds and nettles are permitted to choak up half the graves in a church-yard, and every other &s;pecies of negligence and filth is thrown there, as if, in&s;tead of being the decent receptacle of the forefathers of the village or town to which it belongs, it were the common &s;ewer of the pari&s;h. Some few indeed are kept a little more orderly, becau&s;e they are either public walks, and have therefore a degree of fa&s;hion, or the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e is re&s;identiary there; but even the&s;e exceptions are for the mo&s;t part confined to the path-ways, and the green avenues that &s;hade them, the re&s;t of the &s;pot being left in a condition both &s;hame|le&s;s and indecent. In the northern di&s;trict of &mdash;&s;hire, two church-yards were indicted as nui&s;ances by the pari&s;h, and a third, much nearer the &s;eat of magi&s;tracy &s;upreme, was in &s;o abominable a &s;tate, that the clergyman and over&s;eers, after many fruitle&s;s complaints on the part of the inhabitants, were cited to an|&s;wer accu&s;ations in the Spiritual Court.</P>
<P>Good heaven! we want no over&s;eers, bi|&s;hops, or &s;piritual courts, to make us keep our dead (which &s;urely, Sir, are a part of our&s;elves,
<PB N="118" REF="179">whether above the earth, or under it) as free from &s;uch as we can. If the grave we clean holds a good relation we &s;hew our gratitude in our diligence: if a bad one, our con&s;tant at|tention is a mark, that whatever tre&s;pa&s;&s;es he or &s;he, may have committed again&s;t us, it is forgiven. If a nettle or a weed was to be &s;een to-morrow in this church-yard, the living party to whom it belongs, would be hooted after divine &s;ervice, by the whole congregation. I would part with my la&s;t farthing, rather than &s;ee the&s;e two little heaps go to ruin: nay, ex|cept a few feet of earth I cultivate for u&s;e, I decorate my garden with flowers and &s;hrubs only for my dead, and look upon it to be as much theirs, as if they were both alive.</P>
<P>The good woman here fini&s;hed her di&s;cour&s;e, during the greater part of which, &s;he was up|on her knees, plucking up every thing which was un&s;eemly, fre&s;hning the mould, fa&s;tning the loo&s;e tilework, and forming with a mixture, of maternal and conjugal tenderne&s;s, the ro&s;e|&s;lips and violet roots, into forms expre&s;&s;ive of her affection.</P>

<P>I tru&s;t, my friend, you will long continue your good wi&s;hes to the Pembroke&s;hire widow. It is in this part of Wales that the women dre&s;s their heads in a peculiar manner; they wear a cumbrous gown of dark blue cloth, even in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer; in&s;tead of a cap, a large handkerchief is wrapt over their heads; and tied under the chin: in other places, the women as well as the men, wear large hats with broadbrims, often flapping over their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gleanings, however, in the church|yard, are a little out of place, for when I was
<PB N="120" REF="181">on the &s;ubject of Welch court&s;hips, I ought to have immediately gone to Welch weddings; this being, you know, the natural order; unle&s;s you are of the opinion of not a few, who a&s;&s;ert that marriage and death are pretty much the &s;ame thing, and that the former is, only buy|ing the living in&s;tead of the dead. Many of my fair country women, I fear, think the latter would be a re&s;ource to them.</P>
<P>The ceremonies of the Cambrian pea&s;ants, in the unpoli&s;hed parts of the country, are no le&s;s &s;ingular than tho&s;e at their wooing. The friends and relations of both parties, not only te&s;tify the u&s;ual demon&s;trations of joy during the day-time, but keep it up the whole night, the men vi&s;itors putting to bed the bride|groom, and the females the bride, after which the whole company remain in the chamber, drinking jocund healths to the new married couple, and their po&s;terity, &s;inging &s;ongs, dancing, and giving into every other fe&s;tivity, &s;ometimes for two or three days together.</P>
<P>Prepo&s;terous enough you will &s;ay! but as this, generally &s;peaking, happens to a man and wo|man but once in a life, and gives now and then an holiday, that is, a few hours or days labour to a race of harmle&s;s, hard-toiling creatures,

<HEAD>LETTER X. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I A&s;&s;erted that the lower order of people in this country are &s;uper&s;titious. They were &s;o at all times. Anciently its contagion tinctured the more enlightened. One of the old hi&s;to|rians very gravely recounts numberle&s;s pre|ter-natural in&s;tances of ca&s;ualties, which he con&s;trued into divine judgments. Among&s;t others, he tells us, that in the reign of Ivor, the third prince of Wales, there happened a remarkable earthquake in the I&s;le of Man, which much di&s;turbed and annoyed the inha|bitants, and in the year following that it rained <HI>blood</HI> both in Britain and Ireland; in&s;omuch that the butter and milk re&s;embled the colour of blood. What &s;anguinary torrents, my friend, mu&s;t have fallen to have thus changed the na|ture of the gra&s;s, and literally to make "the green, one red!" He adds, the&s;e accidents of nature might probably pre&s;age &s;ome rumults and di&s;|turbances in the kingdom. The &s;ame author, I remember, a&s;&s;erts that as a progno&s;tic of the death of Elbodius, archbi&s;hop of North Wales, there happened a very &s;evere eclip&s;e of the &s;un,
<PB N="123" REF="184">and the year following there was an eclip&s;e of the moon, and upon Chri&s;tmas day! and the&s;e he confiders as portents that boded no good to the Welch affairs. By way of making out the prediction of the effect of the&s;e fatalities, we are &s;olemnly informed they were followed by a very grievous and general murrain of cattle, which impoveri&s;hed the whole country, and the year preceding, A. D. 808, was mark|ed by the We&s;t Saxons laying the city of St. David's in a&s;hes. Thus it is, my friend, that &s;oothe&s;ayers of every age fir&s;t frame their pro|phecies, and then inveterately fulfil them; for the very next good or evil event that takes place, is brought in evidence of what was foretold, and however ab&s;urd in the nature of things, or contradictory to the point in que&s;tion, at the time is tortured and twi&s;ted, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of illu&s;trating. Hence the mo&s;t im|probable, phy&s;ically &s;peaking, the mo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ble and heterogeneous circum&s;tances, are forced into contact, and effects are traced to cau&s;es with which they have no &s;ort of con|nection.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent de&s;cendants of Cadwallader are true to the faith of their forefathers on this ar|ticle. I &s;aw it operating during my re&s;idence among&s;t them in a thou&s;and ways, but in none
<PB N="124" REF="185">more than in the in&s;tance which follows. In a little village, betwixt Caermarthen and Ha|verfordwe&s;t, beautifully wa&s;hed by the ocean, I walked by the &s;ide of the &s;ea, where a mixed multitude were gathered on the beach. I en|quired the occa&s;ion, and was told, that the peculiar roaring of the waves to the we&s;tward indicated that &s;ome fatal accident would &s;oon befal certain poor creatures out at &s;ea; for that, in the memory of the olde&s;t man living, the billows were never known to make that hide|ous noi&s;e from that quarter, without being &s;ucceeded by either the wreck of a ve&s;&s;el, or the de&s;truction of &s;ome of the crew, or both; that this being the fir&s;t day of the roaring, the di&s;a&s;ter would probably happen in the cour&s;e of two days more, <HI>three</HI> being the u&s;ual term of the&s;e grumbling notices; and therefore they were now come down to the beach, as well to &s;ee whether any ve&s;&s;el had hoi&s;ted &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, or, if too late for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to receive dead, &s;hould any of the bodies be thrown on &s;hore. The time at which this happened was that of the herring &s;ea&s;on, when, pro&s;iting by the previous calm weather, a great many fi&s;hing-boats were out; and it is by no power that I have over language, nor indeed in lan|guage it&s;elf, to give you a ju&s;t idea of the con|&s;ternation of many per&s;ons of both &s;exes now
<PB N="125" REF="186">gathered together, mo&s;t of them being wives, children, ma&s;ters, or relations of tho&s;e who&s;e de&s;tiny was thus denounced by the troubled &s;pirit of the waters. The fi&s;hing-boats, how|ever, in the cour&s;e of the next day and even|ing, all arrived &s;afe, with their crew, and with &s;ingularly good cargoes: &s;ome other ve&s;&s;els, which had &s;tood farther out to &s;ea on coa&s;ting voyages, took &s;helter in the &s;ame harbour, till the &s;torm &s;hould cea&s;e, or rather till the fair weather &s;hould be more confirmed, for it had con&s;iderably cleared and calmed before they pointed their canva&s;s to the &s;hore. All they wanted was a &s;light repairing, which could not be conveniently given at &s;ea. The little fi&s;h|ing-&s;macks performed &s;everal lucky excur&s;ions after this, the other barks proceeded on their re&s;pective voyages, and, though in the mean time, there was not heard any more prophe|tical growlings, the people were not in the lea&s;t &s;taggered in their belief of &s;ome calamity having happened, roundly a&s;&s;erting that the voice of the ocean was always oracular; that its mouth was opened by God; and that it could not therefore utter the thing that was not. Another evidence was, that more than one in&s;tance was within the recollection of every man, woman, and child, in the pari&s;h. About a month after, happening to pa&s;s through
<PB N="126" REF="187">this village in my way back from Milford Haven, I under&s;tood, from the landlord of the inn where I &s;topped, that, notwith&s;tanding my incredulity about the roarings, the &s;ea did not roar <HI>without rea&s;on,</HI> for the bodies of two &s;ailors were floated into the harbour the very day after I went away. This your are to know was above three weeks after the tempe&s;t; but on my venturing to doubt the connection be|twixt the effect and the cau&s;e, on account of the di&s;tance of time, mine ho&s;t grew &s;eriou&s;ly angry, and a&s;ked me whether I was a believer or an heathen? I did not think proper to re|ply to this angry que&s;tion, convinced that a man, <HI>predetermined</HI> either to believe, or di&s;be|lieve,&mdash;whether in politics, religion, or any other matter, hardens his heart again&s;t every thing that does not feed his faith, and is pre|pared again&s;t all arguments, human or di|vine; and, like a cat pent up in a corner, is only more &s;piteful and re&s;olute, as it ap|pears difficult to break away. Ju&s;t as the O&s;tler was leading my hor&s;e to the door, a couple of &s;ailors came to the inn, and, in pre|&s;ence of my landlord, informed me, that they were brother and uncle to the afore&s;aid dead mariners, who had de&s;erted after mutiny, were brought back once, and pardoned: then threw them&s;elves overboard, thinking to &s;wim a&s;hore,
<PB N="127" REF="188">and would have been hanged if they had not been drowned, as 'twas on board a king's &s;hip. Thus you &s;ee the poor &s;ea was made to &s;ympathi&s;e with the&s;e offenders; unle&s;s you can borrow a little of my landlord's faith, and be|lieve that it drowned them in a judgment, and then &s;ent forth its roarings, to &s;hew its &s;en&s;e of &s;uch wickedne&s;s, as a warning to others. There, exclaimed mine ho&s;t, with much exul|tation, is not the thing plain enough now? Was the &s;ea in the right or not? But &s;ome folks will never believe till a judgment falls on them&s;elves! Perceiving a tempe&s;t gather|ing in the countenance of this friend of the roaring &s;ea, I thought it the wi&s;e&s;t way to leave him in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a faith which had certainly the merit of being impregnable to all attacks from within or without.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;uper&s;tition, univer&s;ally prevalent in South Wales, is of a nature no le&s;s extraor|dinary. You will &s;carce meet with a pea&s;ant, or even a manufacturer, who does not pretend to have heard the groan, or &s;igh, of a voice ru&s;h like a &s;udden wind from out of the earth; and &s;ometimes, entering into a very long and &s;o|lemn harangue on the topic, either of this world or the next. Sometimes it a&s;&s;umes the tone of a friend, &s;ometimes of a foe; &s;ome|times
<PB N="128" REF="189">it is the well-known &s;ound of a per&s;on living; but more u&s;ually one that has been in the grave long enough, one &s;hould have thought, to have done with conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>A third object of Cambrian credulity is that of a lighted candle &s;pringing up before you, without a moment's warning, and going the way of your intended walk or ride for a num|ber of miles together, for it perfectly knows the road you are to take; and what is no le&s;s &s;ingular, the candle is carried by &s;ome invi&s;ible agent, who was never known to make his ap|pearance, though &s;ome &s;ay it moves by a power of its own. With re&s;pect to the moral agency of the&s;e, it is generally allowed by the be|lievers, that both the voice, and the light, are &s;ent on "errands full of love." The fir&s;t is thought to be literally a <HI>warning</HI> voice, and the la&s;t, with a little more difficulty, though no|thing is, in the end, too arduous for &s;uper&s;ti|tion, is made to be no le&s;s &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of a faith which even in its exce&s;&s;es leans to virtue.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I have &s;eldom attempted to argue down, or treat lightly, the&s;e and other little traditionary credulities, in con&s;tant circu|lation among&s;t the uneducated part of man|kind;
<PB N="129" REF="190">&s;ince I am per&s;uaded, what they want in philo&s;ophy, they make up by a much better thing; for there is almo&s;t always a &s;en&s;e of religion accompanying the&s;e village legends: a per&s;on who &s;ees, or &s;eems to &s;ee, the&s;e &s;ights, or hear the&s;e &s;ounds, is too &s;en&s;ibly affected by his imaginations to mix immediately in wor&s;e weakne&s;&s;es; the invi&s;ible voice will never ar|gue in favour of a guilty deed, nor the vi|&s;ionary candle conduct the man it attends to &s;cenes of debauchery. On the contrary, the former will more &s;urely &s;ugge&s;t repentance to the erring &s;wain, and the other light him on his way to at lea&s;t harmle&s;s thoughts and ac|tions. Could we, therefore, &s;ay to &s;uper&s;tition, "thus far &s;halt thou go, and no farther," the &s;imple of life and of heart might enjoy tho&s;e little wanderings uncontrouled.</P>
<P>But Super&s;tition like Power is among&s;t the encroachers we dare not tru&s;t. Indulgence makes her bold and un&s;ea&s;onable, till in the end &s;he becomes the parent of the wor&s;t di&s;orders to which the human &s;oul is incident. You will hardly &s;uppo&s;e that the mo&s;t foaming &s;ectaries infe&s;t the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of this country; that methodi&s;ts of all denominations make the mountains reverberate with their fulminations, louder than the anathemas of Rome, and that
<PB N="130" REF="191">there is &s;carce a village, or a dozen &s;cattered hamlets, which receive not twice or thrice a week the effu&s;ions of a &s;trolling preacher.</P>
<P>Something more affecting than curio&s;ity, has made me &s;everal times an auditor of the&s;e flaming di&s;cour&s;es, which are held in barns, &s;tables, or the open fields. It &s;eems incre|dible that half the congregation &s;hould be contained in the villages; but the fact is, that on the preaching days, the people come pour|ing in from all quarters, within the di&s;trict, and vales and mountains give up their inha|bitants. I &s;hall not &s;peak to you of the doc|trine, which is pretty much the &s;ame every where; and England is &s;ufficiently over-run by the&s;e itinerants, to make its jargon familiar to every one, except that both the doctrine, and the way of delivering it, is more vehement and vociferous in Wales than I ever remember to have witne&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere. In &s;peaking of the Lamb of God, the preacher a&s;&s;ured his hearers, that if they were &s;incere believers, they would feel it move, and hear it bleat within their hearts; that, if lifted up by the Holy Spirit, they might &s;ee it; that if they folded up their hands they might reach it, touch it, and embrace it, as he did, under divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at that mo|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="192">Previous to this la&s;t round in the ladder of fanatici&s;m being gained, like the Delphic God "his voice enlarged, and his form was <HI>more</HI> than ruffled;" but, on mounting the climax, his bellowings could be equalled in horror only by his contortions. No bull, driven into madne&s;s by the annoying dogs, and more di&s;tracting men, &s;o flounced or &s;o &s;hifted his attitudes, or roared with &s;o much mingled rage and agony: but if the phrenzy of the preacher could have been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, it would have yield|ed to that of the congregation; the tears, &s;ighs, and yellings of which, accompanied by the extravaganza's of action, really threw at <HI>&s;ober</HI> di&s;tance all that I ever &s;aw, all that I ever heard of human or of bea&s;tial violence.</P>
<P>I do not know whether this intemperate zeal ob&s;tructs or promotes the indu&s;try of the&s;e poor creatures; whether they return to their &s;everal occupations with more or le&s;s a&s;|&s;iduity, after the&s;e ebullitions; but as the preachings begin about noon, and continue &s;ome hours, it mu&s;t ab&s;orb a great deal of that time, which might be pa&s;t in more u&s;eful, though le&s;s violent labour; for I dare venture to &s;ay, the harde&s;t work they were ever put to for a day together, never &s;o wa&s;ted their ani|mal &s;pirits, &s;trained their mu&s;cles, or wearied
<PB N="132" REF="193">limbs, as two hours pa&s;t in this religious fury.</P>
<P>But even this is better than the oppo&s;ite ex|treme of fitting arrogantly loo&s;e to all reli|gions; or, what is wor&s;e, &s;coffing at the faith of others, and affecting to have none one&s;elf. This is among&s;t the errors into which the &s;ons and daughters of &s;implicity rarely fall. It is re&s;erved for the children of refinement, to &s;purn at all things holy, with them religion is a mighty convenient, well-contrived bugbear, to keep the &s;laves of the world in order, ju&s;t as birds are &s;cared by a maukin; but that more enlightened fouls cannot be expected to give into the illu&s;ion: &s;o that the rich, the pro&s;pe|rous, and all tho&s;e who have received the greate&s;t bounties and indulgencies at the hands of Providence, are the only per&s;ons who think them&s;elves exempt from the duty or nece&s;&s;ity of acknowledging it.</P>
<P>My friend, I have lived in the world, and travelled over it, long enough to be convinced, that what &s;uperficial pretenders call philo|&s;ophy, has done more mi&s;chief a thou&s;and times a thou&s;and than either ignorance or &s;u|per&s;tition. Every conceited &s;park that has courage enough to avow him&s;elf an Athei&s;t,
<PB N="133" REF="194">and ju&s;t wit enough to &s;port the old thread|bare arguments in &s;upport of it, is now a philo&s;opher; that is, he can laugh at the je&s;t he breaks on religion, and repeat, with vi|vacity, the bla&s;phemous <HI>bon-mots</HI> that others have made again&s;t the author of it, not reflect|ing, that indecency in wit, like immode&s;ty in beauty, is a ba&s;e pro&s;titution of tho&s;e &s;acred gifts which are truly delightful only in the pro|portion that they are innocently exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>But this irreverence of things holy, is by no means the effect, either of true philo&s;ophy, or true courage: for both the&s;e are friends to piety; and there is as much difference betwixt a common-place Athei&s;t, and a Chri&s;tian phi|lo&s;opher, as betwixt an hero and a coward. Pretenders to infidelity are, indeed, always cow|ards: they are afraid of their own con&s;ciences, the "compunctious vi&s;itings" of which they at|tempt to e&s;cape by a loud laugh, as children and common country people endeavour to di&s;|gui&s;e their terrors in pa&s;&s;ing through a church|yard in the dark, by making a noi&s;e, or whi&s;t|ling as they run.

Look at the modern affecter of philo&s;ophy, that is of infidelity, in his hours of &s;ickne&s;s, or in the moments of death! Did tho&s;e friends or relatives, who are then behind the curtain, ever report &s;atisfactory or con&s;i&s;tent accounts of the philo&s;ophy of the expiring guilty? The in&s;tances are rare, even where the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous <HI>philo&s;opher-athei&s;ts</HI> have died, without ei|ther formally di&s;avowing, or by implication believing their mi&s;erable &s;y&s;tem! As the exce&s;s of wickedne&s;s is certainly the extreme of folly, we may fairly adopt the maxim of our truly Chri&s;tian poet,&mdash;
<Q>"Men may live fools, but fools they cannot die."</Q></P>
<P>Will you not then come into my apology for a village &s;uper&s;tition under certain re&s;trictions? Sacred be the vi&s;ionary candle, and the fancied voice! They may lead perhaps to the para|di&s;e of &s;implicity, but will not &s;educe the ea&s;y of faith into the paradi&s;e of fools.</P>
<P>May faith, philo&s;ophy, and the virtues, which are their offspring, be their guide. Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I Rejoice to hear, by your's, that you are well amu&s;ed with the &s;ubject of my la&s;t, for I have not yet done with it. I have, in re|&s;erve, another Welch &s;uper&s;tition, by way of <HI>Bonne-Bouche;</HI> for, if I can give it to you with any of the impre&s;&s;ions it made on me, you will find it more entertaining than any I have yet recounted.</P>
<P>Contrive to be &s;erious, I beg of you, while, in &s;oberne&s;s, I acquaint you, that queen Mab, and all her El&s;in train, however bani&s;hed out of England, have at all times had both hou&s;e and land in Wales. There is not a more ge|neral received opinion throughout the princi|pality, than that of the exi&s;tence of <HI>fairies.</HI> Among&s;t the commonalty it is, indeed, univer|&s;al, and by no means unfrequently credited by the &s;econd ranks: my in&s;atiable curio&s;ity, in tracing this fact, has enabled me to di&s;cover it in more than one in&s;tance among&s;t the fir&s;t. During my re&s;idence in Glamorgan&s;hire, I was told of a clergyman, who had not only a be|lief in the&s;e little creatures, but who had
<PB N="136" REF="197">written a book, containing a great many of their exploits. The gentleman, who gave me this information, was acquainted with the au|thor, to whom I was introduced, but was ap|prized by my conductor, as we walked along, that he was generally thought to be "a little cracked." As I well know that all &s;orts of people, who follow up any pur&s;uit or pa&s;&s;ion out of the common track of action, or &s;enti|ment, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m nece&s;&s;ary to excel in it, are accounted more or le&s;s out of their minds, and as I have, my&s;elf, been long in the enjoyment of this reputation&mdash;for &s;urely it is a kind of <HI>fame</HI> to &s;uffer in the opinion of the cold and unfeeling for one's warmth of heart&mdash; I laid little &s;tre&s;s upon this part of my guide's information. The &s;ubject which the author had cho&s;en, and the &s;olemn manner in which he treated it, went much more in my mind to impeach his judgment than his intellect; but as every man has his hobby-hor&s;e, a fairy <HI>tale,</HI> is, perhaps, as plea&s;ant to carry one to fairy <HI>land,</HI> as any other; &s;o I made my how to him without prejudice; for, ju&s;t as his friend, my companion, had fini&s;hed this very friendly ac|count of him, we came within view of his par&s;onage, at the door of which he was re|galing him&s;elf with a pipe. We entered into familiar conver&s;ation almo&s;t immediately that
<PB N="137" REF="198">we had changed the civilites of meeting, for he had been appri&s;ed of our coming, and was &s;o full charged with his favourite topic, that he went off like a rocket. The fir&s;t &s;hot being his, I had no opportunity to return it, till he had mo&s;t &s;olemnly atte&s;ted every &s;tory of his book to be apo&s;tolical; he related to me as much &s;upplementary matter, intended to enrich a &s;econd edition, as would have made an eighteen-penny pamphlet of it&s;elf. But our Par&s;on rode his fairy pad &s;o furiou&s;ly, that it not only run away with him, but with our din|ner; and though I have all po&s;&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition to indulge people in the&s;e fallies, hoping for, and in&s;i&s;ting upon, the like complai&s;ance, when I am galloping away on my <HI>own</HI> poney, I felt &s;uch an incorrigible de&s;ire on this occa&s;ion to weigh "&s;olid pudding again&s;t the empty prai&s;e," of the&s;e little imaginary beings in El|fin Land, that I left the good prie&s;t to his "lenten entertainment," and made the be&s;t of my way back, to a more eleemo&s;inary banquet.</P>
<P>Did I not tell you, quoth my introducer, as we went home, that the poor man was mad? though, I think, he was more <HI>compos</HI> to day than I have ever known him. Indeed! replied I, if this is his lucid interval, what mu&s;t be his perfect di&s;traction? O, this is nothing,
<PB N="138" REF="199">an&s;wered his friend, I have known him run on about the fairies, till he has foamed at the mouth like a mad dog, and &s;worn that there were then a thou&s;and in the room with him, vi&s;ible only to him&s;elf, on account of his great re&s;pect for them, and I remember once, one our townsfolk laughing at him, in one of the&s;e &s;airy-fits, he fell into a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, he would make the&s;e little mi&s;chiefs pinch and baunt them by day and night, for their taunt|ings: and, as &s;ure as you are alive, continued my guide, upon two of the company &s;napping their fingers, and &s;aying, they neither cared for him, nor the fairies, he made them both re|pent it: for that very night, and all the next day, the poor men were &s;o tormented by the&s;e little devils, God forgive me, that they were obliged to make intere&s;t with Par&s;on &mdash;, the gentleman we have ju&s;t left, to get them off the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>Then, you believe in their exi&s;tence your|&s;elf?</P>
<P>Heaven forbid! that I &s;hould not. I have been &s;ufferer enough by them, I know, to have my creed well &s;ettled in that re&s;pect. But to tell you the truth, they always had a &s;pite again&s;t me, and my whole family; and, for a
<PB N="139" REF="200">trifle, which would not have put a fly out of temper.</P>
<P>What did you do to vex them?</P>
<P>Only barred up a window, next to the room where you &s;lept la&s;t night.</P>
<P>What objection had they to that?</P>
<P>Why, they u&s;ed to throw up the fa&s;h every night, and &s;teal every thing they could lay their hands on.</P>
<P>Are they &s;uch di&s;hone&s;t brats! The little rouges! Who could have thought it?</P>
<P>The greate&s;t thieves in the world, Sir, little as they are.</P>
<P>Are you &s;erious? Do you really believe in them?</P>
<P>Believe! I wi&s;h you would, to night, &s;leep in the barred room, that's all.</P>
<P>With all my heart.</P>
<P>I would not advi&s;e you. You had better not. I wi&s;h I could throw it out of my hou&s;e, without pulling the whole building to pieces.</P>
<P>I'll venture, however.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="201">No you &s;han't. I won't have your life, nor your limbs to an&s;wer for; be&s;ides, the little toads begin to be tired of hankering about, and if I keep it clo&s;ed another year, I expect they will find another haunt. For they don't fancy any apartment but that.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;imilarity in the faith of you, and your friend on this article, why laugh at him, or con&s;ider him as out of his &s;en&s;es?</P>
<P>Let us call a better &s;ubject, Sir, for, you &s;ee, we have got &s;afe home, and if you are half as hungry as I am, you will think a good &s;pare|rib of pork, which, I expect to find on the table, though betwixt hot and cold, is worth all fairy-land.</P>
<P>Thus it is, my friend, we are accurate cri|ticks, in di&s;covering and expo&s;ing the weak|ne&s;&s;es of others, but are quite blind to our own, <HI>tho' of the &s;ame &s;ize and kind.</HI> How true it was from the beginning! How true it will be to the end! that "we &s;ee the more in the eye of our brother, but di&s;cover not the beam in our own."</P>
<P>Believing that I had fallen, partially, among&s;t the votaries of the fairy legions, by meeting with two men, who, though of different man|ners
<PB N="141" REF="202">and characters, had nearly the &s;ame degree of credulity, the one a wor&s;hipper from fear, the other from reverence, I re&s;olved to &s;ee far|ther into the &s;ubject, before I concluded the opinion, about the&s;e airy &s;prites to be general: for to tell you the truth, I came with a mind little favourable to admit the impre&s;&s;ions, which Camden, and other Cambrian biogra|phers had attempted to make upon it; &s;hall I confe&s;s, that I not only conte&s;ted the fact it&s;elf, as to the agency of the&s;e beings, as &s;incerely as I did tho&s;e gentry of Liliput, about their own &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ize and dimen&s;ions, but I thought the report of the&s;e hi&s;torians, <HI>likewi&s;e</HI> a fiction allowed to travellers as an indul|gence, in the way that we grant a poetical licence to the votaries of the mu&s;es. Having, therefore, an equal degree of lei&s;ure and curi|o&s;ity, I was fixed to make farther enquiries; accordingly, the day following, I accepted the offer of an agreeable, and intelligent compa|nion, who propo&s;ed an excur&s;ion to the hills in the neighbourhood of Pontipool, which had been immemorially celebrated, for the ancient and modern haunts of this tiny people. In this little tour, the beauty of the day, and of the country, rich in whatever could gratify a traveller, I collected abundant living evidence, that the <HI>belief</HI> in the&s;e &s;mall per&s;onages was
<PB N="142" REF="203">&s;olemn and general. Tho&s;e, &s;aid my a&s;&s;ociate, pointing to a chain of &s;tupendous, and even Al|pine hills to the left, tho&s;e, though, I believe it not, are thought to be every night traver&s;ed by thou&s;ands of fairies; the centre part of the mid|dle mountain, is called their table, and on num|berle&s;s green circles, which grow greener under their &s;toot&s;teps, they are &s;aid to revel. We en|tered, with freedom, &s;everal little picture&s;que cottages, &s;cattered round the&s;e delicious hills and vales, and I perceived that on the &s;ubject of fairies, the creed of every pea&s;ant was the &s;ame; in every hut, I found &s;uper&s;tition had a &s;eat: but I found that better, at lea&s;t, more ho&s;pi|table gue&s;ts were al&s;o, the inmates: health, hap|pine&s;s, &s;implicity, indu&s;try, innocence, and pa|ternal love. The heart-echoing ki&s;s, which a labourer gave to his twelfth child, the nur&s;e|ling, while &s;ix others were gathering round him, after a &s;eparation only of a few hours, and while bread is all his utmo&s;t toil could work out of the mountains, was a &s;ight that might have taught wi&s;dom to a philo&s;opher, envy to avarice, and humility to a monarch. It reached my very heart. It will not be remote from yours; but to move, to melt it, in the &s;ame degree, you mu&s;t make a vi&s;it to the fairy mountains, and on &s;uch a day, amid&s;t &s;uch
<PB N="143" REF="204">&s;cenery, have your mind <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> with &s;uch objects, upon the &s;pot where they grow.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, that there are particular places all over this country, where the malign in|fluence of the fairy tribe, has made the people look upon them as under a &s;ort of &s;pell. Thus, if we put the collective accounts together, we &s;hall perceive, that the fairy race are, rather bad than good neighbours: for, you will hardly meet with a Welch pea&s;ant, who is not pro|vided with &s;ome in&s;tances to their di&s;credit, within his own knowledge. It is incredible to what lengths the malice of the&s;e &s;prites will go, if we are to believe the a&s;&s;everations of the &s;wains they live among&s;t: in&s;tead of being in good-fellow&s;hip as might be expected of well|di&s;po&s;ed fairies, they take delight only in cheating and annoying them. There are &s;e|veral hou&s;es, particularly &s;ome antique halls, which have &s;o ill fame for being <HI>haunted</HI> by the fairies, that the poore&s;t per&s;ons in the country, would rather &s;leep un&s;heltered, and
<Q>"Bide the pelting of the pitile&s;s &s;torm,"</Q> than have the fine&s;t apartments therein: I am certain, they would not pa&s;s a &s;ingle night in any of the&s;e <HI>pro&s;cribed</HI> places, for the &s;ee-&s;imple of the e&s;tates thereunto belonging.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="205">The outrages &s;aid to be committed nightly, by the fairy generations, exceed the pranks, of that order of young fellows, or old fellows with young follies, known by the &s;pirited names of bucks and bloods; and their thefts and depredations, about the country, &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of the gyp&s;ey tribes: with this aggravation too, that there is no con&s;table to take them up, nor any ju&s;tice able to make them keep the peace, or commit them to the hou&s;e of correction, or even bind them over to better behaviour. They are above all law, and of cour&s;e, beyond the reach of an act of parlia|ment; which, is certainly, a great hard&s;hip on the Welch pea&s;ants, who, though overrun with them, and put nightly into bodily fear, can neither &s;ue for tre&s;pa&s;s, nor recover damages, nor make them pay for an a&s;&s;ault!</P>
<P>Their malicious devi&s;es, would fill as many folios, as Sir John Hill's Vegetable Sy&s;tem, and their petty larcenies, are as numerous. And the&s;e are not confined to the neighbour|hood of Pontipool, but extend northward to the boundaries of the Principality. I heard of their naughty doings again, in Merioneth|&s;hire, Carnarvon, and Angle&s;ey; not only the firm belief in their exi&s;tence, extending to the&s;e places, but as thorough a conviction,
<PB N="145" REF="206">that they are, with very few exceptions, as er|rant a pack of Little Pickles, as any in the world, and a kitten with a cracker at its tail, or a bird with a &s;tring to its leg, is more likely to re&s;t in the hands of a parcel of &s;choolboys, than a poor &s;wain, or dam&s;el in the clutches of an offended fairy.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible in the&s;e enquiries, not to have often in mind, the many beautiful de|&s;criptions of Shak&s;peare: and my old friends, Puck, Pea&s;eblo&s;&s;om, and Robin Goodfellow, were frequently playing their waggeries in my fancy: but little did I &s;uppo&s;e, when I have been delighted with the&s;e per&s;onages, that there was a part of the world, appertaining to my own country, where a countle&s;s number of really &s;hrewd people, believed as firmly in the exi&s;tence, and potency of the&s;e creations of &s;uper&s;tition, as in that of their God.</P>
<P>I have forborn the relation of a thou&s;and &s;ad, and merry, fairy tales, the re&s;ult of my re&s;earches into this curious &s;ubject, becau&s;e one is as good as a thou&s;and; and that one you &s;hall have here, as a &s;pecimen of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In my way to England, I &s;lept a night in the village of Fe&s;tiniog, and being the only tra|veller,
<PB N="146" REF="207">then in the hou&s;e, had the choice of the bed chambers. I fixed upon that which I thought the mo&s;t commodious, and after I had taken my &s;olitary repa&s;t, was preparing to re|tire, when my landlady made her appearance, and &s;aid, that &s;he could not an&s;wer it to her con&s;cience, to let me go to re&s;t, without tell|ing me, that the apartment I had cho&s;en, though the be&s;t in her hou&s;e, had the misfor|tune to be troubled by the fairies; that had I been an ordinary &s;tranger, &s;he &s;hould not have mentioned it, but being recommended to her hou&s;e, by one of her be&s;t friends and cu&s;tomers, &s;he felt it her duty to appri&s;e me of the cir|cum&s;tance; after which, I might do as I plea&s;ed. She concluded this aweful intel|ligence, by informing me, &s;he had &s;oundly rated the chambermaid, for her carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, in &s;hewing that apartment, the door of which was never opened, but when the inn was full of company, and not another bed to be had.</P>
<P>Whether it proceeded from that queer pro|pen&s;ity in human nature, to do what you are warned not to do, or from a &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;t|ance, to the&s;e &s;implicities of faith, I do not know. I can only tell you, that my landlady's caution, determined me not to profit by it. I thanked her, however, for the hint, and de|&s;ired
<PB N="147" REF="208">to be &s;hewn to the haunted chamber, de|claring to her, at the &s;ame time, that I had been &s;o great an admirer of fairies, ever &s;ince I read one of our great poet's account of them, that I was perfectly &s;atisfied they would rather look on me, as an old acquaintance, than a &s;tranger, and treat me as &s;uch: and furthermore, as it was exce&s;&s;ive cold weather, if fifty, or an hun|dred of the little gentlefolks were di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s the night with me, they would be extremely welcome to part of my bed, and I did not doubt butthat, &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, I &s;hould be able in the morning, to give a very good account of my bedfellows.</P>
<P>For that matter, Sir, &s;aid mine ho&s;te&s;s, one of your great poet-men, and, who was a lord, into the bargain, took a fancy, likewi&s;e, to that very room, where he &s;lept three nights, and pa&s;t his days where you are now &s;itting, after clambering up and down the mountains for hours together.</P>
<P>Well, and did <HI>he</HI> make any complaints of the common di&s;turbers of that chamber?</P>
<P>He was too mild and &s;weet-tempered a gen|tleman, to make complaints about any thing; but on my a&s;king, if he &s;aw or heard more
<PB N="148" REF="209">than he wi&s;hed, or found his window thrown open, or any of his things to&s;s'd about the room, or any pattering of little feet, or, in &s;hort, any fairy work going forward? He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, it was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for a man, he &s;aw plainly, to be in the mo&s;t retired parts of the world, but he would be annoyed with bu&s;y bodies, and im|pertinents that would be a&s;king que&s;tions, and forcing them&s;elves, uncalled, into company.&mdash; This was pretty plain, I think, Sir.</P>
<P>I think &s;o too, and will, therefore, go to bed, landlady, for you have mentioned a rea|&s;on, for my preference of that chamber, that out-weighs all the fairies of Merioneth&s;hire, were they every one, at this moment, making merry in my bed: the great poet you allude to was Lord Lyttleton. I know he was at Fe&s;tiniog, and am glad to find that accident has conducted me to the &s;ame inn, and even into the &s;ame apartment. I have read what he wrote here.</P>
<P>Aye, he was always <HI>&s;cribbling,</HI> poor dear gen|tleman, when he was within doors, and when he was without, he ran up and down hills and dales, in &s;uch a manner, though neither young nor &s;trong, that folks, hereabouts, thought him
<PB N="149" REF="210">a madman; but his <HI>valet de &s;ham,</HI> told us, he was only a poet; and was making a book about us Welch people, and our country: tho' what he could find here worth putting in a printed book, I cannot think; yet, he was quite be&s;ide him&s;elf with joy, and often told my hu&s;band, that we ought to think our&s;elves very happy, as we lived in Paradi&s;e: for that matter, we do not live ami&s;s, con&s;idering a poor, lone place; we get fi&s;h and game of all &s;orts in plenty, and now and then, can &s;hew a joint of meat, with any body, as your honour &s;hall &s;ee, if you &s;hould like to &s;tay with us as long as the Poet Lord.</P>
<P>Finding that the good woman had no other idea of Paradi&s;e than that we &s;hould there be &s;ure of the be&s;t provi&s;ions, and choice&s;t rarities for the palate, (which idea is, by the bye, to the full as refined, as that of numberle&s;s in|habitants in polite cities,) I again bade her good night, and withdrew to the haunted chamber.</P>
<P>I declare to you, that the hone&s;t people who are terrified about the&s;e little fellows, y'clept fairies, never more earne&s;tly wi&s;hed they might be free from their vi&s;itations, than I did for their appearance; at the &s;ame time, that I de|&s;paired
<PB N="150" REF="211">of being honoured by this fairy-favour. Neverthele&s;s, I was kept &s;ome hours from the lea&s;t de&s;ire to &s;leep; the night was piercingly cold, but it was about the third quarter of the moon, who&s;e fro&s;ty clearne&s;s, threw into the apartment, preci&s;ely that &s;ort of elfin-light, which the&s;e little per&s;onages are &s;aid to love; and, certainly, if they have any human &s;en&s;a|tions about them, or are at all &s;en&s;ible to the change of &s;ea&s;ons, on their tiny frames, which, by being &s;o often &s;een in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI> mu&s;t be occa&s;ionally corporeal, a &s;nug birth in a warm bed-chamber, would be pre&s;erable to any thing they could meet with on the &s;nowy mountains, or in icy vallies. I had talked my|&s;elf, and thought my&s;elf neither into expecta|tion or hope; yet who&s;oever follows up an en|quiry of any kind, with undimini&s;hing ardour of curio&s;ity, will be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to &s;lumber, than he who&s;e inve&s;tigations have attained their propo&s;ed end.</P>
<P>As I lay in this wakeful &s;tate, I ran over all the pretty things that have been &s;aid by our Poets on the fairy &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I repeated, aloud, &s;everal of the favourite pa&s;&s;ages, from the beautiful poems of Parnel, in <HI>his</HI> "Fairy Tale," and in the "Ode to In|difference."
<PB N="151" REF="212">I invoked the &s;prites even by the Spirit of Shak&s;peare, which, I cannot but believe, has a potency far &s;uperior to their own; in this mu&s;ing mood I remained till the peep of dawn, when it is admitted, that the&s;e children of darkne&s;s, like all others of that ca&s;t and character, <HI>&s;teal</HI> off. I, therefore, com|po&s;ed my&s;elf to a &s;hort &s;leep, after which, I ro&s;e with an intention to pro&s;ecute my journey.</P>
<P>The very moment I got down &s;tairs, my landlady took notice that I looked very poorly, and no wonder, &s;aid &s;he; I was &s;ure your honour could not &s;leep, for all your <HI>braggado&s;ia:</HI> I heard you, Sir, talk to the fairies for half an hour together; our rooms are parted only by a thin boarded partition. I warrant, you had your room full of them: don't deny it, Sir, becau&s;e I heard you &s;peak to them as plain, and indeed, louder than I now hear my&s;elf: nay, if it had not been for fear, I would have come and knocked at your door, for they can|not bear to be &s;urpri&s;ed at any of their tricks.</P>
<P>It &s;eems I had been taken in the fact of re|citing the ver&s;es, which my landlady interpreted into addre&s;&s;es to the fairies; for as to repeat|ing at &s;uch a time of night, and in &s;uch a chamber, for my own diver&s;ion, it could neither
<PB N="152" REF="213">enter voluntarily, nor be driven coercively, in|to her head, without admitting at the &s;ame moment the mo&s;t thorough conviction of my in&s;anity. Be&s;ides this, there is &s;omething &s;o unwelcome in combating any notion a per&s;on has taken up and is plea&s;ed with, that I con|tented my&s;elf with leaving the matter open to the good woman's interpretation, by &s;aying, in the words of Beatrice: "I confe&s;s nothing, and I deny nothing." It was therefore taken for granted, that I had not only &s;een, but di&s;|cour&s;ed with the fairies all night; that I had intre ted them to be civil; that I had begged pardon for not before having faith in them; and that, if they would &s;pare me only that once, I promi&s;ed to build a temple for them, to ki&s;s their "tiny foot&s;teps, and to wor&s;hip them for ever." To this effect did mine ho&s;te&s;s con&s;true the different recitations; many of which, you, who are ver&s;ant in all that our great bard, and the minor poets, have &s;ung or &s;aid on the &s;ubject, will recollect to be appli|cable to the occa&s;ion, particularly the follow|ing pa&s;&s;ages:
<Q><L>"Ye Elfin &s;prites,</L>
<L>"Come, now a roundel and a fairy &s;ong,</L>
<L>"Come &s;ing me now a&s;leep, then let me re&s;t."</L></Q></P>
<P>This, my landlady &s;aid, was begging what they never granted, for they always broke
<PB N="153" REF="214">people's re&s;t when they got into their bed|chambers.</P>
<P>After I had laid about an hour, without any vi&s;itant, I invoked Queen Mab her&s;elf, and in language which, had &s;he been within hearing, &s;he mu&s;t have an&s;wered in per&s;on, or been looked on as a fairy of no ta&s;te or genius:
<Q><L>"Thou art (I know) a &s;pirit of no common rate,</L>
<L>"Thou can'&s;t give fairies to attend me &s;trait;</L>
<L>"Can'&s;t bid them fetch me jewels from the deep,</L>
<L>"And fing, while I on pre&s;&s;ed flowers do &s;leep.</L>
<L>"Hop in my walks, and gambol in my eyes;</L>
<L>"Feed me with apricots and dewberries,</L>
<L>"With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;</L>
<L>"Steal for me honeybags from humble bees;</L>
<L>"For my night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,</L>
<L>"And light them at the fiery glow-worms eyes,</L>
<L>"And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,</L>
<L>"To fan the moonbeams from my &s;leeping eyes."</L></Q> Yes, yes, quoth mine ho&s;te&s;s, I heard you beg|ging and praying them to fetch you fruit and honey, but the deuce a grape, or a mor&s;el even of bees-wax, you get from them. You &s;oon was of that opinion too, your honour, I fancy, for you gave them their true character &s;oon after. I judge &s;he interpreted the malign pro|perties attributed to them by our great bard in the &s;ub&s;equent lines, which, I remember, I re|peated with a &s;ort of malicious energy, as if,
<PB N="154" REF="215">filled with their &s;ubject, I felt my&s;elf piqued at their refu&s;ing to pay me a vi&s;it. We know a thing is very little likely to happen, and yet we work up our wi&s;hes to a warmth &s;o fairy|like, as to be frequently di&s;plea&s;ed and di&s;ap|pointed, that it does not. Who has not found this unrea&s;onable &s;ally in him&s;elf?</P>
<P>What! will none of you appear ye little tormentors, cried I, in my &s;oliloqui&s;ing way?
<Q><L>"This mu&s;t be the &s;pite,</L>
<L>"Or I mi&s;take, of that &s;hrewd knavi&s;h &s;prite,</L>
<L>"Call'd Robin Goodfellow,</L>
<L>"That frights the maidens of the villagery,</L>
<L>"Skims milk, and &s;ometimes labours in the quem,</L>
<L>"And bootle&s;s makes the breathle&s;s hou&s;wi&s;e churn,</L>
<L>"And &s;ometimes makes the drink to bear no barme,</L>
<L>"Mi&s;lead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm."</L></Q> I have heard of your pranks, my little ma&s;|ters, continued I, and pre&s;ume you are upon &s;ome now. Each mi&s;chievou&s;ly employed, I warrant you:
<Q><L>"Some to kill cankers in the mu&s;k ro&s;ebuds</L>
<L>"Or war with rear-mice for their leathern wings,</L>
<L>"To make them coats!</L></Q> And as for you, Ma&s;ter Puck,
<Q><L>"Up and down then, up and down,</L>
<L>"You are fear'd in field and town;</L>
<L>"Over hill, over dale,</L>
<L>"Through bu&s;h, through briar,</L>
<L>"Orer park, over pale;</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="216">"Through flood, through fire,</L>
<L>"You do wander every where;</L>
<L>"Swifter than the moon's &s;phere,</L>
<L>"You do &s;erve the fairy queen,</L>
<L>"To dew her orbs upon the green."</L></Q> Nay, I have heard you boa&s;t you could
<Q><L>"Put a girdle round about the earth</L>
<L>"In forty minutes.</L></Q></P>
<P>My landlady told me, they were capable of taking all &s;hapes, but &s;he gave into the com|mon notion of their tripping off at day-break. On her a&s;king my opinion of this very gravely, I with no le&s;s &s;olemnity pretended to believe it in the general, but that a very great poet in my country, greater than her friend, Lord Lyttelton, and who had a mighty veneration for all the&s;e little per&s;ons, declared that, al|though many of them
<Q><L>"Wilfully exile them&s;elves from light,</L>
<L>"For fear that day &s;hould look their &s;hames upon;</L>
<L>"Yet there are &s;pirits of another &s;ort,</L>
<L>"Who with the morning light have oft made &s;port;</L>
<L>"Who, like a fore&s;ter, the groves may tread,</L>
<L>"Even till the ea&s;tern gate, all fiery red,</L>
<L>"Opening on Neptune, with far ble&s;&s;ing beams,</L>
<L>"Turns into yellow gold his &s;alt-green &s;treams."</L></Q>
Your fine poetmen &s;eldom &s;peak &s;o as a poor body can under&s;tand them, &s;aid the good wo|man all I know is, our Wel&s;h fairies are &s;een only at night; but I am glad you believe in them, or they would do you an ill turn before
<PB N="156" REF="217">you get home. Now, though I had as much belief in the wall and moon&s;hine of Pyramus and Thi&s;be, I pretended my faith was fixed: I was a convert.</P>
<P>By way of pre&s;ent comfort and future &s;ecu|rity, however, mine ho&s;te&s;s promi&s;ed me, on my expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ign to pa&s;s another night under her roof, to put me into the yellow room, to which, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, the little tormentors had a particular objection. Determined to humour the je&s;t, I affected to be highly &s;atisfied with this, and &s;he then told me the &s;tory of a neighbour who had lo&s;t a che&s;t of drawers, and &s;everal other pieces of furniture, which were found, after many days, above a league off, upon one of the enormous druidical &s;tones, as at the top of an high mountain; where, added &s;he, not an hundred men could drag it, and that, there|fore, it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;prighted</HI> away by fairies. Upon my &s;hewing tokens of &s;urpri&s;e, that the&s;e mi|&s;erable Lilliputians &s;hould be more powerful than an hundred men, my landlady informed me that it was all done by magic, and that they had been known to move trees, and carry away men and hor&s;es out of their warm beds and &s;et them fa&s;t in the middle of a quagmire, or drop them on a bare heath merely by charming&punc; As I wi&s;h'd to &s;ee a little more of
<PB N="157" REF="218">this fairy land than was to be di&s;covered through the windows of my inn, I ended the con|ver&s;ation, by ob&s;erving to my ho&s;te&s;s, that this was carrying the &s;light of hand to a wonder|ful perfection indeed; and it would be highly worth while for Me&s;&s;rs. Jonas, Bre&s;law, and the other pre&s;to pa&s;s gentlemen, who <HI>live by enchanting,</HI> to come and make a few improve|ments in the art of magic, or "delicate decep|tions," as they have been called, by the <HI>profe&s;|&s;ors</HI> in conjuration.</P>
<P>Such a fall of &s;now had happened in the night, in addition to what was on the ground before, that, though the &s;un did the be&s;t that it could for me at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, neither my old hor&s;e, nor his ma&s;ter, were di&s;|po&s;ed to proceed that day any farther, at lea&s;t together; &s;o I made a tour of the mountains and vallies on foot; vehemently refu&s;ing all of|fers of a guide, whom in a ramble of this kind I have all my life con&s;idered as an in&s;up|portable interruption; for it is among&s;t my &s;upreme plea&s;ures to find out the wonders and beauties of nature with my own eyes, to rea|&s;on about them with my own under&s;tanding, and to extract all the knowledge they are able to give me out of them&s;elves, before I a&s;k other people; who officiou&s;ly tell you every thing
<PB N="158" REF="219">before you come to it, and then it is ten to one but their account of the fact, and the fact it&s;elf, is at lea&s;t as wide from each other, as would have been my own una&s;&s;i&s;ted conjec|tures; be&s;ides that it deprives me of the <HI>plea|&s;ures</HI> of conjecture, which are (to an inqui&s;itive mind&mdash;that is to a mind, that likes to an&s;wer its own que&s;tions)&mdash;always &s;omething. More|over, I have found the&s;e common-place hi&s;to|rians of the village, or country, to be not a whit more u&s;eful, though full as learned as tho&s;e biographers in great cities, appointed to explain the wonders of St. Paul's in London, or St. Peter's at Rome; their explanations, being nearly as illu&s;trative of the objects, as the elaborate commentators on the texts of Shak&s;peare, or the Holy Bible. The volumes of Nature and Religion, my friend, rarely re|quire any of the&s;e darkling elucidations; for both are &s;o &s;imple, and &s;o intelligible, that in general, he that runs may read and under|&s;tand them; and, wherever there are difficulties in either, they are, u&s;ually, made wor&s;e and more intricate, by bungling guides, who con|found confu&s;ion. For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, I perambulated the environs of Fe&s;tiniog alone, and thus added another in&s;tance of my ob|&s;tinate adherence to my own plans, which pro|duced
<PB N="159" REF="220">a portentous &s;hake of my landlady's head.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was going out of the door, &s;he hinted that the young pea&s;ant &s;he de&s;igned to accompany me, was thought a good <HI>&s;cholard,</HI> and could talk Engli&s;h by the hour together. Had it been po&s;&s;ible for my former re&s;olution of being a &s;olitary, to have received any acce&s;&s;ions of &s;trength, this intelligence would have the more determined me; for the affectation, of &s;cience among&s;t common people, produces &s;uch in&s;ufferable jargon, that it is even more nau&s;eating, than the pompo&s;ity of pedantry it|&s;elf. Had the guide only &s;poken Welch, or been gifted with ab&s;olute &s;ilence, he might have had his u&s;e, ju&s;t to keep me from two or three pitfalls, into which I tumbled head over heels in cour&s;e of my walk, the &s;now having treacherou&s;ly covered their &s;urfaces. But to e&s;cape the&s;e little ca&s;ualties, at the expence of having one's ears a&s;&s;ailed, by a <HI>good &s;cholard,</HI> while the &s;tupendous works of Nature, were inrolled in volumes before me, by the Divine Author; un&s;ullied volumes that reached almo&s;t to the &s;kies&mdash;would have been bla&s;phemy. For never, &s;urely, in any part of his <HI>creation</HI> did the <HI>Creator</HI> di&s;play him&s;elf with more awful mag|nificence, with more a&s;toni&s;hing grandeur, than
<PB N="160" REF="221">in the precincts of the little village of Fe&s;ti|niog, on the day that I made my &s;urvey of it.</P>
<P>This, you are already appri&s;ed, is the place, the Summer dre&s;s of which, Lord Lyttleton &s;o agreeably de&s;cribes. He tells us, that at the time he vi&s;ited it, it was in the perfection of beauty. From the height of this Merioneth&s;hire village, which is the mo&s;t lovely one my eyes ever be|held, you have, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, a view of the &s;ea; the hills are green, and well &s;haded with wood: there is a delightful rivulet, which winds through the bottom, on each &s;ide are meadows, and above are cornfields, on the de|clivities of the immen&s;e mountains; at each end are mountains &s;till higher, which &s;eem placed there by nature, to guard this charming retreat again&s;t any invaders. With the wo|man one loves, with the friend of one's heart, and a good &s;tudy of books, one may pa&s;s an age there, and think it a day. If one has a mind to live long, and renew his youth, let him come and &s;ettle at Fe&s;tiniog. Not long ago, there died there, an hone&s;t Welch farmer, who was an 105 years of age: by his fir&s;t wife he had thirty children, ten by his &s;econd, and four by his third: his younge&s;t &s;on was eighty|one years younger than his elde&s;t; and eight
<PB N="161" REF="222">hundred per&s;ons de&s;cended from his body, at|tended his funeral.</P>
<P>My &s;econd vi&s;it to this happy vale in the &s;pring, ju&s;tified the above luxurious account. Its a&s;pect, when covered with &s;now, gave to the re&s;pective objects, a &s;ublimity, which <HI>cannot</HI> be done ju&s;tice to, but by the memories of tho&s;e, who have &s;een a country abounding with a&s;pi|ring mountains, and humble glens, and every other grand irregularity of Nature, under the domination of fro&s;t and &s;now. The&s;e, in flat countries, pre&s;ent nothing but one uniform, un|intere&s;ting wa&s;te: amid&s;t the mountains, there is the cataract, which re&s;i&s;ts the powers of ice; the variety of ground, that throws, even the ice it&s;elf, and the &s;now, into a thou&s;and fanta&s;tic forms; the hardy pea&s;ants, that brave the wea|ther in a manner utterly unknown to &s;outhern regions; the adventurous animals, that, im|pelled alike by the element and their ap|petite, dig the &s;hrub on the points of the rocks, hunt for the peri&s;hed herb, through mountains of &s;now piled on the mountains of earth, and an infinity of objects there only to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Full of this kind of imagery, I pa&s;t &s;everal hours of the colde&s;t day; but therewithal, the
<PB N="162" REF="223">brighte&s;t of winter. The &s;now had drizzled for about half an hour, but more radiant &s;un|&s;hine &s;ucceeded; yet the fro&s;t was &s;o much &s;tronger than the thaw, that the flakes encru&s;ted on my hat and cloaths as they fell, and I was as complete an icicle, on my return to the inn, as any of the &s;urrounding objects.</P>
<P>The &s;urrounding objects, indeed, on my re|turn, were in perfect contra&s;t to tho&s;e without doors. The whole pea&s;antry of the village of Fe&s;tiniog, appeared to be got into the public hou&s;e, where the blazing hearth and vacant hilarity, &s;et fro&s;t and &s;now at defiance. The&s;e happy groups are very frequent in North Wales, and particularly in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, when the rigorous elements drive men more upon their internal re&s;ources. This, however, was an extraordinary occa&s;ion. The member for Merioneth, in which county &s;tands this &s;weet village, had given a fat &s;heep, and a barrel of homebrewed to the poor of every pari&s;h within his di&s;trict, to counteract the inclemency of the fro&s;t: and this animal was roa&s;ting whole in the kitchen, while the gue&s;ts were gathered together in bli&s;sful expectation, in a room ad|joining. All that could beat an alarm to ap|petite, or give to appetite gratified its mo&s;t perfect tranquillity, was at work: an harper
<PB N="163" REF="224">played the Triumph of Wales in one corner, a poet &s;ung his own compo&s;itions, in imitation of the ancient bards, in the other, &s;everal Welch dam&s;els joined in chorus; the fir&s;t foaming jug of ale was drank off to the founder of the fea&s;t, the &s;now fell fa&s;t, and was drifted on the windows, and the warmth of heart that reigned within, when the roa&s;ted &s;heep made its appearance, was more than enough to baffle the rigour of a December in Siberia.</P>
<P>You know enough of my di&s;po&s;ition to be certain, I mixed in the&s;e jovial doings with all my heart. Without &s;taying to be a&s;ked, I &s;aw that I was welcome. I was in a land of ho&s;pi|tality, and had I not been &s;o, the company were, at the moment, too replete with fe&s;tivity to be churli&s;h to a &s;tranger. Could one enter the hou&s;e of a mi&s;er, while he was enjoying him&s;elf on the bounty of a friend, he could &s;carcely &s;hut his heart to one that wi&s;hed to be happy al&s;o. Happine&s;s is naturally benevo|lent: and as the poor in their hours of relaxa|tion are, perhaps, the happie&s;t of the happy, &s;o are they, when they have any thing to give, the mo&s;t bountiful of the generous. Many of the&s;e will&mdash;I have known them to do it&mdash;&s;hare their la&s;t &s;hilling, their la&s;t meal, with a good
<PB N="164" REF="225">will, as &s;ervent an urbanity, and as courteous, as if they were only dividing with you, the &s;uper|fluities of their ordinary table. The poor of Wales are, on all fe&s;tive occa&s;ions, the kinde&s;t of the liberal. "I eat, drank, and was merry," and in proce&s;s of the evening, every gambol that health, innocence, ru&s;ticity, and good fellow&s;hip, let loo&s;e from toil, could devi&s;e, took its round. Since the days of Cadwallader, to tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent Prince of Wales, there never was &s;een a more comfortable &s;et of human creatures, on a more &s;tormy night, through which many of them had to &s;eek their way to their habitations, in the different huts, that were &s;cattered in the mountains, or in the valley. But this idea did not break in upon the pre&s;ent moments, which were devoted to joys, that, in &s;weet oblivion, ab&s;orbed the fu|ture. You remember the winter evening of the Engli&s;h pea&s;ants, de&s;cribed by Thom&s;on: It was now realized in Wales. The charming lines came to my memory, as I &s;at at the fe&s;tival; and they again recur at this in&s;tant: they are at the end of my pen. You would not forgive me for driving them back: Here then let them flow on the paper.</P>
<Q><L>"Meantime the village rou&s;es up the fire;</L>
<L>"While well atte&s;ted, and as well believ'd,</L>
<L>"Heard &s;olemn, goes the Goblin-&s;tory round;</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="226">"The rural gambol, and the ru&s;tic mirth;</L>

<L>"Of native mu&s;ic, the re&s;pondent dance.</L>
<L>"Thus jocund fleets with them the winter-night."</L></Q>
<P>After this harmle&s;s merry-making, which was certainly as pa&s;toral, as if it had been the arcadia of primitive times, each departed to his home, and were fenced within, by hilarity and good cheer, again&s;t all annoyance from without, &s;o effectually, that, I &s;u&s;pect, it was neither in the power of fro&s;t, &s;now, or &s;uper|&s;tition, to chill them. Such are, truly, what my friend Gold&s;mith &s;o poetically called,
<Q>"The &s;till &s;mall joys that a&s;k but little room."</Q></P>
<P>I do not know the time, when I pa&s;&s;ed an evening more to my &s;atisfaction; nor when I crowned the night, with a more quiet re&s;t, in de&s;pite of fairies and fairy tales. May your's, my friend, this, and every other night, be as undi&s;turbed, after as plea&s;ant days.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>IF we examine Lord Lyttelton's de|&s;cription of Fe&s;tiniog, &s;hall we not think him a little unrea&s;onable? and, in one or two pa&s;|&s;ages, not quite correct as to &s;entiment? With the woman one loves, the friend of one's heart, and a good &s;tudy of books, there is &s;urely &s;carce a man in the world, who&s;e mind is fitted to reli&s;h them, but would convert Arabia Infelix into a Paradi&s;e. There needs no &s;uch happy vales as that of Fe&s;tiniog, to render a per&s;on &s;o environed with heart-felt re&s;ources, more than content. I argue, that even in ab&s;ence of the&s;e, at lea&s;t, the la&s;t article, many a year might pa&s;s without a weary moment. No. I renounce the thought in the very in&s;tant that I have made it. I feel, that if the &s;tudy of books might be di&s;pen&s;ed with, the &s;ocial, bo&s;om joys, which the two other &s;ources afford, may not be given up. His Lord&s;hip is in the right. The charm of &s;eeing others happy, and being one of the party, made me for a little while forget, that the be&s;t part of their felicity proceeds from dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s. The men were &s;urrounded by their fa|milies,
<PB N="167" REF="228">and &s;uch as were not, I remember, had le&s;s jocund countenances, and &s;eemed "maim|ed of half their joys." On finding that the &s;now continued to fall violently, had you &s;een how the mothers folded up their little ones, and how the fathers forced their great coats on the &s;houlders of the mothers, and almo&s;t &s;trip|ped them&s;elves, to fortify their wives and loves again&s;t the cold; in particular, had you ob|&s;erved, as I did, how a young fellow, after put|ting the handkerchief that tied his own neck, on that of a la&s;s whom he loved, carried her in his arms, to the merriment of the whole com|pany, and de&s;iring every man to do as he did, while in a frolic, betwixt the tenderne&s;s and glee of their hearts, they &s;et off with the wo|men in the &s;ame manner, the mountains re|verberating with the "long loud laugh, &s;incere," you would have &s;tood at the door, as long as I did, and been as little &s;en&s;ible of the cold.</P>
<P>Ah, my friend, there is nothing to be long enjoyed, in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e who are dear to us! I feel that I am renewing the happine&s;s of the &s;cenes, I have been plea&s;ed with in my journeyings, by de&s;cribing them in corre&s;pond|ence to you and other of my friends: nay, I felt while they were pa&s;&s;ing before me, that I
<PB N="168" REF="229">&s;hould again take delight in them, when I pre|pared them for the po&s;t; and I often have amu&s;ed my&s;elf with thinking, as I rode by a beautiful pro&s;pect, met with agreeable people, or gave way to the emanations of a tender di&s;po|&s;ition, how &s;trongly will I point, and recom|mend all the&s;e to the friends of my heart.</P>
<P>Pr'ythee, tell me, does ab&s;ence &s;often the memory of injuries received? Does it take off the edge of that indignation one naturally feels for tho&s;e who have u&s;ed us ungratefully? I have left behind me, now &s;ome hundred miles, more than a few per&s;ons, the recency of who&s;e unkind thoughts and practices towards me ought to prevent my cea&s;ing to think of them: I do not cea&s;e to think; but I think of them every day with le&s;s a&s;perity. My &s;en&s;e of their inju&s;tice is the &s;ame: perhaps it is the more impre&s;&s;ive the oftener it is re|flected upon: but there is &s;omething in my nature, either &s;o exce&s;&s;ively tender or weak, that, without affectation, I a&s;&s;ure you, if, in the particular conduct of an avowed enemy, (one for in&s;tance who has &s;aid and done all that an enemy can or dare do and &s;ay) there is on my recollection a &s;ingle trait of good|will or good-nature &s;hewn to me, prior to the date of his enmity, and I have a memory very
<PB N="169" REF="230">faithful and retentive to kindne&s;s, I fa&s;ten upon <HI>that</HI> trait as a fort of re&s;ource from the <HI>pain</HI> of thinking on the general tenor of his behaviour. Nay, if I have ever pa&s;&s;ed any happy days or hours in the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who have afterwards made me pa&s;s many com|fortle&s;s or bitter ones, it is not ea&s;y to expre&s;s how I feel within me a propen&s;ity to &s;ink the memory of the latter, and take refuge in the former. This I have rea&s;on to believe hath not a reli&s;h of benevolence in it, becau&s;e my ideas of the ill-treatment I may have received are unaltered; of cour&s;e, the per&s;ons of &s;uch as have occa&s;ioned it, are no le&s;s irk&s;ome to thought: but it is a great relief to me, from that very mi&s;ery of dwelling on the dark &s;ide of human nature, where there is but a ray of light to turn it on the other. For this rea&s;on, though it is a &s;elfi&s;h one, perhaps, I am hourly more convinced, that I am not made for long re&s;entments: for to you, and to God, I declare, that, though I have not parted many years from &s;ome who, I have rea&s;on to think, &s;eek to do me an ill turn, for no other cau&s;e that I can recollect, but that they have injured me too greatly ever to forgive me; I cannot pay them in kind, by meditating ill-will, or even ill wi&s;hes; and though, as I ob&s;erved above, there is neither "the milk of human kindne&s;s," nor
<PB N="170" REF="231">any other &s;oftening quality in all this, but to get rid of the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations that accompany even a ju&s;t revenge, or the contemplations which lead to and prepare it, it is at lea&s;t &s;o far a greater felicity in temperature than the bias which di&s;po&s;es a man to brood over his wrongs, and lie in wait, as &s;ome minds have &s;hewn a power of doing, for months, years, half a long life, till opportunity gives effect to accumulated vengeance. To obtain, at the end of only one year, the mo&s;t compleat re|venge over tho&s;e mo&s;t injurious, I would not exchange this con&s;titutional gift of tenderne&s;s, &s;elf-love, or whatever you think fit to denomi|nate this capacity, of preferring plea&s;ant to di&s;|agreeable reflections.</P>
<P>I would claim a much greater degree of merit from the eternally unfading fre&s;hne&s;s with which I remember my ab&s;ent <HI>friends,</HI> did not their virtues, talents, or kindne&s;s to me, preclude all &s;ort of merit even on that &s;ubject, and make that remembrance a &s;imple act of ju&s;tice. But I may at lea&s;t &s;ay, that my memory of them is green and immortal as the laurel, and triumphs over ab&s;ence, adver&s;ity, and even over the more oblivious power that often attends on pro&s;perity. The deliberate traveller mu&s;t either be worthle&s;s him&s;elf, or a&s;&s;ociate only
<PB N="171" REF="232">with tho&s;e that are of that de&s;cription, if in his route, he does not find &s;ome, who have demands on his admiration for their genius, pity for their misfortunes, or friend&s;hip for their good offices. Of all the&s;e I have had my &s;hare, but, believe me, none have, or ever can have, power to impair the &s;entiment with which I retain every impre&s;&s;ion due to tho&s;e from whom I am &s;eparated. My "untravelled heart" turns to them even when &s;ilence has been con&s;trued into neglect, and I appear to have forgotten them. Each of them comes to my memory with a fondne&s;s which often makes my heart ache, that human life, occupation, and events, permit not the power of giving as frequent expre&s;&s;ion to kind wi&s;hes, as they are felt and excited. In years of greater lei&s;ure and fuller health, the delights of corre&s;pondence more than compen&s;ated for the quantity of time em|ployed in &s;u&s;taining it. I neither &s;eemed nor de&s;ired to have any other employment than to receive and reply to the letters of my friends. Every po&s;t brought me the conti|nued hi&s;tory of their joys and &s;orrows, and I gave mine in return with an ardour that doubled the one, and took from the other at lea&s;t half its &s;tings. But, alas! the wants of health, of time, or of happine&s;s,
<Q>"check'd the genial current of the <HI>pen,"</HI></Q>
<PB N="172" REF="233">which is an in&s;trument of "the &s;oul." Deep, heavy, and ince&s;&s;ant too, are the taxes which certain incidents of life levy upon us. Many of the&s;e may make us &s;acrifice the &s;weete&s;t occupations of the heart on the altar of more &s;evere exerci&s;es: but never have the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> vio|lent of the&s;e extingui&s;hed one &s;park of that tenderne&s;s I bear to tho&s;e from whom I am divided; and every hour proves to me, that I recollect the virtues, the talents, and endear|ments of old friends, as affectionately as if this maturity of my life was engaged, like its earlier youth, only in the exchanges of per|&s;onal or epi&s;tolary profe&s;&s;ions. Ah! could my powers keep any pace with, or bear any proportion to, my inclinations on this &s;ubject, a corre&s;pondence, regular as that I keep up with you, my friend, &s;hould attempt the amu&s;ement of every other whom I love. If, by my &s;ilence, I am &s;uffering in the opinion of any on the idea of that &s;ilence being in|duced by motives le&s;s cogent than that depri|vation of health, lei&s;ure, and &s;pirits, which make &s;uch frequent breaks in the lettered in|tercour&s;e I carry on with you, my loved friend, and a very few others, could they look in|to my &s;oul at this moment, could they enter into its thoughts almo&s;t every moment of every day, they would not &s;imply acquit me of
<PB N="173" REF="234">rai&s;ing new friend&s;hips on the ruins of the old, but confe&s;s, that I reflected on their me|rits as warmly, and on their failings (when I thought on <HI>them</HI> at all) as candidly, as in the mo&s;t glo&s;&s;y &s;ea&s;ons of attachment.</P>
<P>How have I rambled into the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h de|velopements? Mu&s;t I needs call them by &s;o har&s;h a name? In ab&s;ence, many delicate ap|prehen&s;ions a&s;&s;ail us. The very phy&s;ician that recommended the exerci&s;es of my pen &s;et very un&s;ocial bounds to them; for he knew, that the very po&s;ture of writing was, if long con|tinued, pernicious to that inveterate pain and malady in my brea&s;t, which has &s;o ince&s;&s;antly vexed me. It &s;tops the progre&s;s of my pub|lic engagements: it continues to limit my private communications; and though my mind and body are relieved when I can in any mea|&s;ure &s;urmount the&s;e bo&s;om-evils, (and I am daily <HI>gleaning</HI> a little more of health as I go along) I am never &s;o churli&s;h as to keep an unbroken hour to my&s;elf, but invariably de|vote the be&s;t part of it to you and to others whom I appreciate; and, in the &s;ea&s;ons that I cannot do this, I at lea&s;t <HI>think</HI> kindly of you.</P>
<P>Accept then the&s;e pages of &s;elf-defence; for I know that the &s;pirit of accu&s;ation has gone
<PB N="174" REF="235">forth again&s;t me on the article of corre&s;pon|dence: and if any thing could induce me to believe your welcome flatteries as to the merit of the&s;e letters, I &s;hould derive the greate&s;t joy from the hope, that, if I adopt the propo&s;al you have made, of publi&s;hing them, I might acquire a &s;en&s;ible gratification by uniting pub|lic with private favour.</P>
<P>Forgive me, and return with me to Fe&s;ti|niog; or rather to my Lord Lyttelton's de|&s;cription of its attractions: among&s;t which he &s;eems to reckon <HI>longevity.</HI> I fear, however, this is a complai&s;ance he was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew the country. Tho&s;e who have long lived in towns, a&s;&s;ume the ideas and feelings of a poet, happy, though but for a few weeks or days, to forget that they are men of the world. Country church-yards are among&s;t the ob|jects mo&s;t travellers vi&s;it tran&s;iently; and when we have ta&s;ted the rural breeze, luxuriated in its pro&s;pects, and been fre&s;hened by a change of air and objects, we naturally enough con|clude that we have left the abodes of di&s;ea&s;e, langour, and untimely old age, and have, at length, found the regions of perpetual health, and of life, equally happy and long. From experience, neverthele&s;s, of the fallacy of &s;uppo&s;ing our "days of nature" are more in
<PB N="175" REF="236">number when pa&s;t in the &s;hade, than amid&s;t the "hum of men," I have regretted, I know not how often, that, in this ca&s;e, as in many others, truth and poe&s;y are &s;o much at variance.</P>
<P>I u&s;ually pa&s;s an hour amid&s;t the man&s;ions of the dead, in every town or village at which I pau&s;e; and I am, you know, a pau&s;ing tra|veller; I always have been &s;uch: but if graves and tomb&s;tones are to be con&s;idered as the faithful regi&s;ters of their re&s;pective pari&s;hes, and, I believe, they are to be pretty much depended upon; for all our little vanities are there u&s;e|le&s;s, and even the buried beauty there con|fe&s;&s;es her age&mdash;the village annals will, I believe, have little to boa&s;t of the antidote of zephirs, or the anodyne of whole&s;ome labour, after undi&s;|turbed repo&s;e. I have more than once had the curio&s;ity, in this country, and in others, both at home and abroad, to compare the dates of life and death, as they are &s;tated in the burial grounds, and if I have, &s;ometimes, been inclined to think the country church-yard, on a calcu|lation of equal inhabitants, the repo&s;itory of fewer young, and of more advanced old age, I have on the general average found, that the a&s;&s;ertion of a celebrated touri&s;t on this &s;ubject, is founded in fact. It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ays he, that life is longer where there are fewer
<PB N="176" REF="237">opportunities of luxury; but a cottager grows old over his oaten cakes, like a citizen at his turtle fea&s;t. A poor man is, indeed, &s;eldom incommoded by corpulence. Poverty pre&s;erves him from &s;inking under the burthen of him|&s;elf, but he e&s;capes no other injury from time. In&s;tances of long life are often related, which tho&s;e who hear them, are more willing to cre|dit than examine. To be told, that any man has attained an hundred years, (as in the ca&s;e Lord Lyttelton has related,) gives hope and comfort to him, who &s;tands trembling on the brink of his own climacteric. Length of life is, indeed, di&s;tributed impartially to very differ|ent modes of life, in very different climates; and the mountains have no greater in&s;tances of age and health, than the low lands, nor can vil|lages, and &s;mall towns, produce more examples, than great cities, on a comparative average. Even in the village-receptacle of the dead at <HI>Fe&s;tiniog,</HI> the infant, the youth, the mature man, and the veteran, lie mixing their a&s;hes together; and the in&s;tance which his Lord&s;hip has recorded, is among&s;t the very few, who have materially exceeded the human &s;pan.</P>
<P>But in this little country there live tho&s;e, whom, for the &s;ake of human kind, a benevolent tra|veller could not but wi&s;h he might continue in
<PB N="177" REF="238">the world, till that world it&s;elf &s;hould be no more. The &s;now-clad mountains of Cambria, my friend, have not affrighted the &s;pirit of philanthrophy, from vi&s;iting their inhabitants; nor has the thick-ribb'd ice, that &s;ometimes places an impa&s;&s;able gulph, betwixt a man and his neighbour,
<Q>"Frozen the genial current of their fouls."</Q> The torrid zone boa&s;ts not more glowing hearts, nor animated natures. It would be an here&s;y committed again&s;t the beauties of the creation, to leave Wales without vi&s;iting the &s;everal delicious domains, that appertain to my Lord Powis and his family; e&s;pecially that part, which is <HI>emparadi&s;ed</HI> by Lord and Lady Clive. I make free with that word, as mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the fact: for the two noble per|&s;ons, la&s;t mentioned, have literally rai&s;ed a paradi&s;e around them: but though you will &s;ee wood, water, hill, and dale, man&s;ion-hou&s;es and cottages, in the mo&s;t enviable abundance, all the&s;e are but &s;econdary to ano|ther kind of beauty, which is here to be &s;een in perfection. Were you, for example, to make a circuit of the towns and villages ad|jacent to the &s;eat of Lord and Lady Clive, and enter every hou&s;e where either indu&s;try, indigence, &s;ickne&s;s, &s;orrow, or misfortune, had entered before you, you would hear the voice,
<PB N="178" REF="239">or &s;ee the tear and &s;mile of gratitude pouring forth the heart-felt prai&s;es of this noble pair. I know not when I have pa&s;t a more delight|ful hour, than that which I &s;pent on the road from Oakley Park to Welch Pool. My eyes were gratified with every grace of nature and art in vegetable beauty; my ears were regaled, yet more voluptuou&s;ly, with a number of vil|lage annals, that have made me think more highly of human nature ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I encountered one of Lord Clive's neigh|bours, and here follow, <HI>verbatim,</HI> the an&s;wers he gave to my enquiries. You are ju&s;t to premi&s;e, that we are jogging on in a very neighbourly way, through his lord&s;hip's park, on a fine day, and in the fine&s;t month of the year; and that having conver&s;ed &s;ufficiently on the only acquaintance-making topic, which renders &s;trangers companionable&mdash;namely, the weather, we &s;truck into other &s;ubjects, drawn, principally, like mo&s;t conver&s;ations on the road, from the &s;urrounding objects.</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," cried my a&s;&s;ociate, in an&s;wer to a remark I had made on the beauty of the park through which we were, as I &s;aid, tak|ing our way,
<Q>It is full of good ground, has &s;ome thou&s;and pounds worth of good tim|ber,
<PB N="179" REF="240">a brave head of deer, and game in abun|dance.&mdash;All the&s;e to be &s;ure are good things, but the folks to whom they belong are bet|ter than all of them. I am not a prejudiced per&s;on, never wanting a favour of lord or lady. I never received one but from my own indu&s;try, &s;ince I was born; I therefore may &s;peak.</Q></P>
<P>'No doubt you are an independent man.'
<Q>As an independent man, then, I inform you, that when either the lady or the lord, to whom this domain belongs, leave this world, all the hearts within a &s;core of miles round them, ought to break for it. As for my lady, it would comfort your &s;oul, and make it better, if it wants mending&mdash;begging your pardon&mdash;to &s;ee &s;o fine, &s;o pretty, and &s;o good a creature go her rounds of loving-kindne&s;s, &s;ometimes on foot, &s;ometimes on hor&s;eback, and &s;topping at every hut and cottage, at|tended by all her children, by way of making them take after her.</Q></P>
<P>'And what is the end of tho&s;e circuits?'
<Q>Nothing on earth but to make the poor rich, the &s;ick well, and the &s;ad merry. I have often thought&mdash;God pardon me&mdash;when I have beheld her lady&s;hip, and four or five of
<PB N="180" REF="241">her young ones, open the door of a mi&s;er|able dwelling, which &s;ome of your great folks would not deign to look at, that it was more like an angel from heaven, and &s;ome little children, who, dying innocent, became cherubims, than human creatures.&mdash;Then they are as affable as if the poor things they make comfortable were their equals; and, in &s;hort, in&s;tead of &s;pending their time at a looking-gla&s;s, as thou&s;ands do, who have not half &s;uch hand&s;ome faces to look at, or their &s;ub&s;tance in the follies of the age, they may fairly be &s;aid to keep a kitchen, cellar, and warehou&s;e, well-&s;tored with good things, for tho&s;e that want them.</Q></P>
<P>That is &s;trange indeed: for commonly &s;peak|ing, to <HI>want</HI> the comforts which a fine hou&s;e can &s;upply, is the only objection, my good friend, for with-holding them: for which rea|&s;on, I pre&s;ume, it is, that the very knockers, on the out&s;ide of the doors of great men's hou&s;es, are held by the iron-headed lion, tiger, or &s;ome other bea&s;t of prey; and that even, if a poor vi&s;itor is &s;o &s;orely impelled by ne|ce&s;&s;ity, as to brave this emblem of &s;everity <HI>without,</HI> and having the hardine&s;s to knock, &s;hould thereby gain admittance <HI>within,</HI> he has generally to encounter another bea&s;t of
<PB N="181" REF="242">prey, in office, who&s;e orders are, to &s;uffer tho&s;e only to gain entrance, or at lea&s;t to pa&s;s, who bring no wants but tho&s;e of which they can pay for the gratification: Nay, our town refine|ments are carried yet higher; for, as if neither the iron or brazen-headed mon&s;ter before the door, nor the Cerberus behind it, were &s;uffici|ent guards to repel the &s;ighings of the &s;or|rowful, or the cries of the indigent, the very hi&s;tory of a man's grievances, either of mind, body, or e&s;tate, are forbidden to obtrude them|&s;elves on the nerves and feelings of the great per&s;onages who inhabit the&s;e great hou&s;es; and, if a letter is not fa&s;hionably folded up, &s;u|per&s;cribed in a &s;tyle of fa&s;hionable illegibility, and impre&s;&s;ed with arms that certify the writer to be a petitioner for nothing but what he can purcha&s;e by &s;ome commodity equivalent to that he receives, whether of courte&s;y or commerce, the letter is thrown out of doors, or referred to a reader of all papers &s;u&s;pected to be filled with the complaints of tho&s;e poor devils who throw them&s;elves on the barren &s;oil of a great man's humanity. All &s;uch pa|pers, being found guilty of containing tales of di&s;tre&s;s, and petitionary repre&s;entations of ca|lamities of any kind, are condemned to lie on the in&s;pector's de&s;k, or be given up to the deri&s;ion of the dome&s;tics, who fatten in the
<PB N="132" REF="243">&s;ervants' hall: but on pain of lo&s;ing their places, the&s;e pauper appeals, and mendicant manu&s;cripts, are kept from the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;ion, who cannot have their delicate &s;en&s;ibilities &s;hocked by the mi&s;eries of their fellow-creatures, and imagine, that when they &s;ub&s;cribe to the public ho&s;pitals, in who&s;e tell-tale books the names of the con|tributors, are pompou&s;ly and o&s;tentatiou&s;ly in|&s;erted, they have fulfilled the whole duty of great men and women.</P>
<P><Q>The great people <HI>I</HI> have been &s;peaking of, (continued my companion) are not of that de&s;cription. I remember a pa&s;&s;age in one of the Spectators, the only books, except the Bible and Common Prayer, I ever read, or ever &s;hall read, that ju&s;t &s;uits them; and as I got it by heart when I was fir&s;t &s;truck with its force, I will repeat it to you&mdash;'If they have not the pomp of a numerous train, they have every day they live, the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s that the widow, the fatherle&s;s, the mourner, and the &s;tranger, ble&s;s them in their prayers: they give up the compliments which people of their own condition could make to them, for the plea&s;ures of helping the af|flicted, &s;upplying the needy, and befriending the neglected. Thus, keeping &s;till to them|&s;elves
<PB N="183" REF="244">more than they want, they give a va&s;t refu&s;e of their &s;uperfluities to purcha&s;e heaven, and by freeing others from the temp|tation of worldly want, carry a retinue with them thither.'&mdash;I could employ twice the time it would take us in getting to Welch Pool, were I to tell you of one-third of the good things that I know to have been done by this noble family. They apprentice out the orphans, give portions to young women in marriage, grant annuities to the widows, put their old &s;ervants into farms on their own e&s;tate, and, though too often impo&s;ed on, are &s;till as bountiful as if they had never met with an ungrateful per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>There was &s;omething in the <HI>manner</HI> of this my fellow-traveller, &s;o illu&s;trative of the <HI>mat|ter,</HI> that both at once co-operating on my heart, brought tears into my eyes; which be|ing perceived, and the cau&s;e mi&s;taken, the ho|ne&s;t hi&s;torian of the place caught hold of my hor&s;e's bridle with one hand, and of my arm with the other, exclaiming&mdash;<Q>Perhaps you one way or other &s;tand in need of the help of this noble couple, for there are decayed gentlemen as well as decayed trade&s;men; and if it be &s;o, I &s;hould be very &s;orry that Lord and Lady C. are both from home at this
<PB N="184" REF="245">time on a vi&s;it to Lord P. I &s;ay, I &s;hould be very &s;orry for this, had not I a toler|able good hou&s;e in the neighbourhood on t'other &s;ide Pool, where you may wait the family's return, which is expected on Satur|day.</Q></P>
<P>The influence of a good great man's ho&s;pi|tality is more exten&s;ive than we imagine, and it is in general a &s;ufficient motive of virtue, that it makes other emulous to "do likewi&s;e." Had time and circum&s;tance permitted, I would have humoured this hone&s;t man's mi&s;concep|tion, and gone home with him. As it hap|pened, I could only very truly a&s;&s;ure him, the tears he ob&s;erved on my cheek were tho&s;e of plea&s;ure; and that, though I was now con|&s;trained to take a different road, if ever I again met him in the journey of life, that plea&s;ure would be increa&s;ed, and in the mean time I had a new &s;ource of mo&s;t agreeable reflections, for which I &s;hould bear an hearty good-will to all the inhabitants of Okely Park, and its en|virons, while I had a being.</P>
<P>Soon after this, he turned up a bye lane, which my companion &s;aid would take him a &s;hort cut acro&s;s the country to his hou&s;e, which, as it did not &s;uit me to make a &s;top at now, would be equally at my &s;ervice another time.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="246">In the direct road, I had about three miles to Pool, from the place at which we parted, and though the &s;cenery merits all that travel|lers have &s;aid of it, even to the luxuriant de|&s;cription, which Lord Lyttelton has given of Powis ca&s;tle, which is the fore-ground object, under your eye all the way, I looked at it <HI>then,</HI> almo&s;t without &s;eeing it, my mind's eye being employed on what excels in loveline&s;s all the ca&s;tles, and pro&s;pects of the earth&mdash;|a good heart engaging it&s;elf in acts of gen|tlene&s;s and mercy, <HI>for the &s;ake of goodne&s;s.</HI> A &s;ingle deed de&s;cribed by my travelling com|panion, in the daily benevolence of Okely Park, is &s;ufficient to over&s;et the &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tems of Rochfaucault, Mandeville, and all the herd of Satiri&s;ts on Human Nature, that ever &s;or|didly narrowed its fair proportions; for after all they can &s;ay, Pope is right, when he in&s;i&s;ts that &s;elf-love and &s;ocial, are the &s;ame. Is not the plea&s;ure you will receive, even from the &s;imple recital of &s;o much real virtue, purely benevolent? Is not the gratification I feel in writing it, a &s;pecies of benevolence al&s;o? and if either of us, in the cour&s;e of our day, &s;hall have added but a mite to the ea&s;e, accommo|dation, or comfort, of any one mortal, of even any one animal, to which we have the power of doing good, will it not &s;trew upon our pillows,

But, I need not pre&s;s this argument in defence of the motives of be|nevolence on you, my dear friend, who&s;e whole life is a refutation of every attack, that has ever yet been made on the <HI>principle,</HI> that go|verns the &s;ocial virtues.

<P>N. B. Whenever you vi&s;it Welch-Pool, you will be called upon by Nature her&s;elf, to vi&s;it Powis ca&s;tle, which is in its vicinity. The noble owner being now frequently the inhabi|tant, and having laid out in improvements, more than the three thou&s;and pounds, which my Lord Lyttelton con&s;idered nece&s;&s;ary, to making it one of the mo&s;t augu&s;t places in the kingdom, it commands the admiration of every traveller, and ju&s;tifies the poetical language, which it has received in the following eulogy. It &s;tands on the &s;ide of a very high hill; be|low lies a vale of incomparable beauty, with the Severn winding through it, and the town of Welch-Pool, terminated with &s;ublime moun|tains: the oppo&s;ite &s;ide is beautifully culti|vated half way up, and green to the top, ex|cept
<PB N="187" REF="248">in one or two hills, who&s;e &s;ummits are rocky, and of grote&s;que &s;hapes that give va|riety, and &s;pirit to the pro&s;pect. Above the ca&s;tle, is a long ridge of hills finely &s;haded, part of which is the park; and &s;till higher is the terrace, up to which you are led through very fine lawns, from whence you have a view that exceeds all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>It will not give a bad fini&s;hing to this faithful, though glowing picture, to under|&s;tand, that Lady Clive, and the Earl of Powis, are of the &s;ame family, and not more nearly allied in blood, than by their virtues.&mdash; As you &s;urvey Powis ca&s;tle, you will think of this, and feel every beauty of the place expand on your heart from the recollection.</P>

<P>YOUR affections are touched: you tell me that you cannot pay due homage to the parks, and ca&s;tles I have de&s;cribed, ju&s;t at pre|&s;ent, but that you would take a pilgrimage to Okely barefoot, and that you would do &s;o were

Your letter of ye&s;terday breaks the truce I had made with your heart, by reque&s;ting me to pro|ceed;&mdash;&s;till in conformity to your wi&s;hes, I will go on; but as you &s;ay, your mind is even yet more open to the charms of philanthropy, than accounts of fine &s;cenery, in which are to be &s;een only the charms of nature, this is the moment, as it is the place, to offer you a little hi&s;tory, which I have often intended to &s;ix upon paper, and which de&s;erves for its intrin|&s;ic worth to be engraven, by the regi&s;tering angel, on leaves of adamant. But in the very out&s;et, I have acted un&s;kilfully, for I have rou&s;ed your expectation, and wound up your curio&s;ity before hand, in&s;tead of taking them by &s;urprize, and thereby have rendered the gra|tification more difficult. Your heart is pre|pared for its impre&s;&s;ion, and to anticipate an emotion, is to weaken it. As an author, I
<PB N="189" REF="250">have done wrong: as a man you will pardon me. I felt the force of the facts I was about to dilate, too &s;en&s;ibly, to be upon my guard. My affections were too much warmed to think of taking your's captive, by any &s;tratagems of cold dexterity. To write my letter over again, would injure the glow that is now animating my bo&s;om, and would be an artifice, &s;omething like practi&s;ing on your &s;en&s;ibility. Accept then the &s;tory, ju&s;t as it ri&s;es from my heart to my pen, and without con&s;idering how much a more adroit arrangement of the incidents might have moved you, take it as an in&s;tance of my love for you, that I &s;tand not upon the ceremonies of compo&s;ition, but give you my corre&s;pondence&mdash;"warm from my heart, and faithful to its fires." I have only further to pro|mi&s;e, that every &s;entence of the en&s;uing &s;cenes, records an unadorned, una&s;&s;i&s;ted truth, and that the only injury they can &s;uffer, will be from the defects of the relation.</P>
<P>A merchant, of con&s;iderable eminence in London, was reduced to the &s;ituation of poor Ba&s;&s;anio, and from preci&s;ely the &s;ame run of ill-luck in his &s;ea adventures,
<Q><L>"The dangerous rocks,</L>
<L>"Touching his gentle ve&s;&s;el's &s;ide</L>
<L>"Had &s;catter'd all his &s;pices on the &s;tream,</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="251">"Enrob'd the roaring waters with his &s;ilks,</L>
<L>"And not one ve&s;&s;el '&s;cap'd the dreadful touch,</L>
<L>"Of merchant marring rocks."</L></Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e mi&s;carriages abroad, were added fimilar calamities at home. Several great hou&s;es broke in his debt, and with the wrecks of his fortune, gathered together, he le&s;t the metropolis, and took refuge in the mountains of Montgomery&s;hire. A little girl, then only nine years of age, his only &s;urviving child, was the &s;ole companion of his retreat, and &s;miled away his misfortunes. The care of her education was his mo&s;t certain relief from the corroding reflections of the pa&s;t, and the cer|tainty of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at his death, &s;ufficient to prevent a good mind from the horrors of dependence, &s;oftened his thoughts of the fu|ture; the pre&s;ent was filled up with the de|lights of &s;eeing her ambition yet humbler than her fortunes, and literally bounded by the ob|jects that &s;urrounded her. To tend the flowers &s;he had &s;et with her own hand, to nur&s;e the &s;hrubs &s;he had planted, to &s;port with and feed the lamb &s;he had dome&s;ticated, to &s;ee it follow her in her rambles, and to li&s;ten to the me|lodies of Nature, as they murmured in the waters, or echoed through the woods, were her chief amu&s;ements without doors, and by a
<PB N="191" REF="252">thou&s;and love-taught duties, to make a father forget that he had ever been unhappy, or unfortunate, her deare&s;t &s;tudy within. Of her per&s;onal attractions I &s;hall &s;ay little: a &s;ingle line of Thom&s;on's gives the true&s;t image of them, and of the unaffected mind, by which they were illumined.</P>
<Q>"Artle&s;s of beauty &s;he was beauty's &s;elf."</Q>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to be wretched in the con&s;tant &s;ociety of perfect innocence: the company of a beautiful child, wholly unpolluted by the world, affords one the idea of angelic a&s;&s;ocia|tion. Its harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s appears to guarantee one from harm: we reflect, nay we &s;ee and hear, almo&s;t every moment, it is climbing our knees, playing at our &s;ide, engaging our at|tentions, or repo&s;ing in our arms, the words and acts of an un&s;potted Being, and one can &s;carce be per&s;uaded, any real ill <HI>can</HI> befal us, while a companion &s;o like a guardian cherub is near. When the babe is our own&mdash;&s;ay, ye parents, how the &s;en&s;ation is then exalted!&mdash; Which of you, having at your option the lo&s;s of the ample&s;t fortune, or of the feeble&s;t infant, would not cleave to the la&s;t, and re&s;ign the former? or, if any of you balanced a moment, would not one li&s;ping word, one
<PB N="192" REF="253">ca&s;ual look, turn the &s;cale in favour of nature, and make you think it a crime to have he&s;itated?</P>
<P>Such were the &s;entiments of the merchant, and under their chearing influence he lived many years, during which, a few mountain pea&s;ants, an old relict of his better days, as a &s;ervant, who had been nur&s;e to the young lady, and his daughter, were the only objects with whom he conver&s;ed. So powerful is habit, that we a&s;&s;imilate to per&s;ons, places, and things, that on our fir&s;t introduction to them, we might ima|gine, neither philo&s;ophy, cu&s;tom, or religion, could make &s;upportable. We are &s;urpri&s;ed to find we attach to them, even to endearment. In time, even our former habits, no le&s;s &s;trong in us, are but &s;lightly remembered, and tho&s;e pur&s;uits, diver&s;ions, and &s;ocieties, without which, it once appeared impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould ever pa&s;s a day, are yielded for others, that it <HI>then</HI> would have been thought as impo&s;&s;ible even to be endured. Our merchant would have deemed the company of a monarch an in|tru&s;ion, and the jargon of the Exchange, which had for &s;o many years been mu&s;ic to his ears, could not now have been borne. I have, here, given you &s;ome of his own expre&s;&s;ions. At length he fell &s;ick. His daughter was then
<PB N="193" REF="254">in her eighteenth year; the di&s;order was of a gradual kind, that threatened to continue life, after one has cea&s;ed to love it, and to clo&s;e in death. He lingered eleven weeks, and, the old dome&s;tic being now &s;uperannuated and al|mo&s;t blind, his daughter was at once his nur&s;e, his cook, his con&s;oler; and might truly be &s;aid to make his bed in his &s;ickne&s;s. She wanted not the world to teach her the filial duties. Her own pure heart &s;upplied them all, and her own gentle hands admini&s;tered them. But now, for the fir&s;t time of her exi&s;tence, &s;he ad|ded to her father's angui&s;h. It almo&s;t kills me to look on you, my only love, cried he, with an empha&s;is of &s;orrow, and bur&s;ting into tears. I am &s;ure, replied &s;he, falling on her knees at his bed&s;ide, it has almo&s;t killed me to hear you &s;ay &s;o, and if it would make my deare&s;t father better, I would kill my&s;elf this mo|ment, and tru&s;t in God's mercy to forgive me. Ah, my child, you mi&s;take the cau&s;e and mo|tive of my regrets, re&s;umed the parent&mdash;the thoughts of leaving you without protection&mdash;|there is the bitterne&s;s&mdash;I am not going to be left, &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, I have a pre&s;age you will be well &s;oon, and I am a great pro|phete&s;s, my beloved father. Be in good &s;pirits, for I am &s;ure, you will recover: I have &s;ent to
<PB N="194" REF="255">Montgomery and Welch Pool, and to-morrow, I am to have the two be&s;t doctors in Wales.</P>
<P>Your goodne&s;s is always a comfort, my darling, replied the de&s;ponding merchant, but two thou&s;and Welch doctors could not &s;et me again on my legs.&mdash;If, indeed, I was in a con|dition to procure&mdash;but that's impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;</P>
<P>Procure what? Whom? Nothing is impo&s;|&s;ible, an&s;wered his daughter with the mo&s;t eager ha&s;te.</P>
<P>I have an idle and romantic faith, in the only man in the whole world, that knows my con&s;titution, and he is as far beyond my reach, as if he were out of exi&s;tence</P>
<P>Good heaven! you mean Dr. ******, ex|claimed the daughter. I have heard you often &s;peak of his having twice before &s;aved your precious life, for which I have had him in my nightly prayers ever &s;ince, and &s;hall go on ble&s;|&s;ing him to the hour of my death. O, that I were a man to fetch him!!</P>
<P>The father pre&s;&s;ed her tenderly in his feeble arms, in acknowledgment of her affection, but told her, that, from a multiplicity of other
<PB N="195" REF="256">claims, it would be as impo&s;&s;ible for the Doctor to get down to Wales, as for him&s;elf to go out of his &s;ick bed to London. Do not, therefore, let us think of it, my child, continued the father; &s;ince it is only the aggravation of a vain wi&s;h to know that it mu&s;t end in di&s;appoint|ment&mdash;I am re&s;igned.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this declaration, the mer|chant receiving no manner of benefit from the Welch Doctors, and being unable, indeed, to pay for their continued attendance, without an injury to that &s;canty fund, out of which he had to draw all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, he often &s;ighed out in a voice of pining, as it were, in|voluntarily, the name of ******. The &s;ound of that voice, langui&s;hing for that which might po&s;&s;ibly change its tone to gladne&s;s, penetrated the &s;oul of his daughter, who needed not &s;o pathetic a memento of her father's wi&s;hes, to make her bitterly regret her inability to gratify them. The poor gentleman grew wor&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire for &s;omething, which he imagined might afford a momentary relief, his Amelia, &s;o was the young lady named, took the fir&s;t opportunity of his being compo&s;ed, to go into the neighbourhood, in &s;earch of a per&s;on to &s;etch it from Montgomery. A
<PB N="196" REF="257">little road-&s;ide public-hou&s;e, about a mile from her father's cottage, appeared the mo&s;t likely place to find a me&s;&s;enger. Thither &s;he repaired, and arrived ju&s;t in time to take &s;helter from a &s;udden &s;torm that fell with great violence. At the moment of her en|trance there were none but the old ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s in the alehou&s;e, but in a very few mi|nutes after, it filled with labourers and pa&s;|&s;engers, who, like her&s;elf, &s;ought protection from the hurricane: during the fury, however, of which, &s;he had too much compa&s;&s;ion to mention her wi&s;hes, for &s;he was among&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e nature would not &s;uffer her to "turn an enemy's dog out of door at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on." This nece&s;&s;ary delay, neverthele&s;s, greatly in|crea&s;ed her unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;he kept watching the rain, and the hoped return of fine wea|ther, at the window. Seeing no pro&s;pect of its clearing, &s;he determined to do that her&s;elf, at all hazards, which &s;he could not a&s;k another to perform:&mdash;namely, to be her&s;elf the me&s;|&s;enger; to which end &s;he de&s;ired to know, whether the road &s;he &s;aw from the window, was the neare&s;t and mo&s;t direct to Montgo|mery, or to any other town, where there was an apothecary's &s;hop, and what might be the di&s;tance to any &s;uch place?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="258">The affecting voice in which the&s;e que&s;tions were demanded, and the prevailing appearance of the &s;peaker, gained her an intere&s;t in every hearer and beholder, &s;everal of whom knew, and acknowledged her for a neighbour, ming|ling their expre&s;&s;ions of good-will, with num|berle&s;s kind enquiries after her &s;ick father, for who&s;e langui&s;hing &s;ituation, they unanimou&s;ly declared their pity and regard, and who&s;e death, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to &s;natch him away, they &s;hould long lament.</P>
<P>This la&s;t ob&s;ervation bringing to mind the image of her father's danger more clo&s;ely, the trembling Amelia lo&s;t all thought of her&s;elf, or of the weather, and thanking every body around her for their civility, while her lovely face was covered with her tears, &s;he had got the latch of the door in her hand, and was pre|paring to hurry out on her commi&s;&s;ion, accord|ing to the directions &s;he had received, when a traveller who had not opened his lips, during the conver&s;ation of the pea&s;ants, but &s;at drying him&s;elf at the fire, ro&s;e up &s;uddenly, and beg|ged permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to her. She went with &s;urprize and tottering &s;teps into an adjoining room where he u&s;ed to her the&s;e very words.</P>
<P>"One of your neighbours, young lady, has told me, you have been for many years, the
<PB N="198" REF="259">be&s;t daughter in the world, to the be&s;t father, who has been once the riche&s;t, though now the poore&s;t man in Wales, con&s;idering you and he are to be &s;upported as gentlefolks. It is plain to &s;ee, there is a great deal of di&s;tre&s;s upon your mind, and it is natural to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of it may be removed. I am not, by any means, a wealthy man, but I have had my &s;hare of evils &s;ufficiently, to make me feel for the unfortunate, and I have always, thank God, a &s;omething to &s;pare for the mitigation of hone&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, in whatever country it is pre&s;ented to my view. I beg you will pre&s;ent this trifle, (giving her a bank bill) with com|pliments, begging the favour of his making u&s;e of it, till it may &s;uit his circum&s;tances to return it.&mdash;I have no manner of occa&s;ion for it, till about this time next year, when I will call to a&s;k after his health, which, I hope, will long ere that be e&s;tabli&s;hed; and if it &s;hould not at that time be convenient to make re&s;ti|tution of the loan, we will put it off till the year after, when I will pay a &s;econd vi&s;it to you; as I purpo&s;e pa&s;&s;ing through this country into Ireland, where I have concerns annually. I am now going to London."</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;entence &s;eemed to annihilate the re&s;t. The very name of London had, at that
<PB N="199" REF="260">in&s;tant, more charms for Amelia, than it could ever boa&s;t of creating in the head of any Mi&s;s in her teens, who had her mamma's promi&s;e to pa&s;s a winter among&s;t the &s;ine folks, and fine &s;ights, with which it abounds. But it drew the attention of Amelia, from &s;uperior mo|tives. It was the re&s;idence of her poor father's phy&s;ician, on who&s;e heart &s;he now re&s;olved to make an attempt, by the medium of the ge|nerous &s;tranger, who &s;he rightly judged, would &s;uffer his bounty to take any direction &s;he might wi&s;h, and to whom &s;he &s;tated the mer|chant's anxious, but hopele&s;s de&s;ires.</P>
<P>You have ju&s;t the &s;oul, my dear friend, to &s;ugge&s;t the extacy of Amelia's, on hearing that this much-wi&s;hed for phy&s;ician, was an intimate acquaintance of the traveller, and all the in|tere&s;ts of an old affection &s;hall be tried with the doctor, exclaimed the &s;tranger, as &s;oon as I get to town, on condition that you will now go home to your father with this pur&s;e, and as an a&s;&s;urance, that although I am an <HI>u&s;urer,</HI> I will receive neither principal, nor intere&s;t, till he is very able to pay both.</P>
<P>He did not give the a&s;toni&s;hed Amelia time to refu&s;e, but &s;eeing the weather inclined to remit its rigours, he put half-a-crown into the
<PB N="200" REF="261">hands of the pea&s;ants, to drink the young lady, and her &s;ick father's health; and order|ing his hor&s;e to the door&mdash;mounted and pro|ceeded on his journey.</P>
<P>Does not your bounding heart a&s;&s;ure you, his feelings would have defended him, from be&s;towing a thought on the peltings of the pitile&s;s &s;torm, had they continued to rage? And does it not al&s;o inform you, that this fair pattern of filial piety was proof again&s;t the war of elements: the &s;un&s;hine of benevolence had, indeed, &s;o animated her, that its &s;udden and inten&s;e rays, might have been too &s;trong for her tender frame, had they not been mode|rated by a &s;hower of tears. She had &s;carcely regained her cottage, indeed, when overcome by her &s;en&s;ations, &s;he fainted in the arms of her aged nur&s;e, who had been mourning her delay.</P>
<P>Alas, my friend, what fragile creatures we are! How much at the di&s;po&s;al of contrary events! How totally the va&s;&s;als of &s;orrow, and of joy! How little able to encounter the ex|tremes of either! But you will not ea&s;ily for|give exclamations that detain you from poor Amelia, whom I left in di&s;tre&s;s to indulge them. My heart is but too often the ma&s;ter
<PB N="201" REF="262">of my pen, and guides it as it li&s;teth. Let me ha&s;ten to make atonement, by informing you, that our lovely &s;ufferer, on her recovery, had the plea&s;ure to find her father had do&s;ed be&s;t part of the morning, and though he mi&s;&s;ed her, from his apartment, when he awoke, he told the nur&s;e, that he hoped &s;he was taking a little nece&s;&s;ary re&s;t in her own room, where he de&s;ired &s;he might remain undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>This gave her opportunity to manage her good fortune, of which &s;he re&s;olved to be &s;o excellent an oeconomi&s;t, that the &s;upply &s;he had received &s;hould an&s;wer the wi&s;e&s;t and hap|pie&s;t purpo&s;es: &s;he recollected that the day before &s;he met the benevolent &s;tranger, her father had received by the po&s;t a Bank-bill, to the amount of the quarterly divi&s;ion of his an|nuity; of cour&s;e a farther reinforcement was not immediately nece&s;&s;ary; on which account &s;he had to regret, that the flurry into which her &s;pirits were thrown, had hindered her from per&s;i&s;ting in her refu&s;al of the loan, to the acceptance of which, however, &s;he was &s;ome|what reconciled, when &s;he reflected on the condition annexed to her borrowing it; and an idea, which ju&s;t then &s;tarted to her imagi|nation, of the manner in which it might be
<PB N="202" REF="263">propriated, completely &s;atisfied her feelings on the occa&s;ion. She con&s;idered the gentleman's bank-bill as the luckie&s;t fund in the world, to &s;erve as the phy&s;ician's &s;ee, in ca&s;e the gene|rous &s;tranger &s;hould prevail on him to come, and to that &s;acred u&s;e her heart devoted it. The &s;um was fifty pounds. A recompence which her ignorance in the price of medical advice in the golden climes of England led her to &s;uppo&s;e would be all-&s;ufficient for a journey down to Wales. Alas! were a regular charge to be made out by Doctors W, R, G, F, L, or any other of the popular &s;ons of E&s;culapius, of London, for &s;uch a tour from the grand mart of cu&s;tom, the 50l. would &s;carcely be thought by tho&s;e me&s;&s;ieurs a more than &s;uffi|cient &s;um to pay travelling expences. In many parts of the continent, indeed, where a &s;hilling value in coin that has le&s;s of &s;ilver in its com|po&s;ition, than would be found in the analy&s;is of a &s;ilver penny, is received as a &s;ettled gra|tuity for running a German mile, 50l. would cut a hand&s;ome figure in phy&s;ic, and go very far towards curing a whole city of an epi|demy &s;o far as pre&s;criptions could a&s;&s;i&s;t in its recovery.</P>
<P>As, however, the vi&s;it of Dr. ****** was a point rather "devoutly to be wi&s;hed," than
<PB N="203" REF="264">expected, it being the middle of a very hard winter, Amelia thought it prudent to conceal the little adventure at the public hou&s;e from her father, who&s;e malady, neverthele&s;s, rather increa&s;ed than abated, and his love of life being in effect his love for his daughter, he could not help ooca&s;ionally regretting his impa&s;&s;able di&s;tance from the only man, by who&s;e aid there might be a chance of re&s;i&s;ting his di&s;ea&s;e. There is, you know, a &s;ort of &s;u|per&s;tition which often runs through a family in favour of its family phy&s;ician. Nor is it altogether without a &s;upport from rea&s;on, &s;ince the per&s;on who has long been in the &s;ecrets of our con&s;titution, and familiar with our ha|bits of living, mu&s;t, in all general ca&s;es, be better able to apply the proper remedies, than he who is called into our bedchambers, when there is a di&s;ea&s;e in it, and when he &s;ees us for the fir&s;t time under its influence: be&s;ides which an old phy&s;ician is commonly an old friend, and unites the lenitives of affection to the cathartics of &s;cience; no wonder, then, that we have faith in him, and faith, you know is a great doctor in it&s;elf, performing a thou|&s;and cures, which the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill has not been able to accompli&s;h without it.</P>
<P>You will readily believe, that the bountiful &s;tranger did not break promi&s;e to Amelia. He
<PB N="204" REF="265">kept it indeed &s;o religiou&s;ly holy, that in le&s;s than ten days from the date of his departure, our pious daughter received a me&s;&s;age, pur|porting that a per&s;on at the public hou&s;e begged to &s;peak with her. You, my friend, who&s;e fancy is ever warmed by your affection|ate heart, will immediately conclude what was concluded by Amelia, that it could be only the much-de&s;ired Doctor, who had thus de|licately, to prevent the ill effect of &s;urprize on the &s;ick merchant, announced his arrival. If &s;o, you are in the right. However incon|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uch a long journey might be, it was perfectly in uni&s;on with the &s;pirit of benevolence by which Dr. ****** was moved, to determine upon it the in&s;tant the ca&s;e was &s;tated to him, and to exe|cute what he had &s;o determined, with all the di&s;patch nece&s;&s;ary to an affair of life and death, and the life and death, moreover, of an old and unfortunate friend. My good little girl, &s;aid he, on the entrance of Amelia, who gliding from her father's bed&s;ide with Sylphid &s;teps, ran with duteous ha&s;te to the village inn&mdash;My good little girl, I am come from &mdash;. Heaven! interrupted Amelia, falling on her knees, you are come from heaven to make my father well.&mdash;Under the au&s;pices of that heaven, I tru&s;t I am, re&s;umed the Doctor. Let
<PB N="205" REF="266">us fly this in&s;tant, exclaimed Amelia, in the animated accents of nature&mdash;let us do all things in order, replied the Doctor, in the language of friendly di&s;cretion, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall do more harm than good.&mdash;I pre&s;ume I am not expected? Amelia bowed a negative. Then my &s;udden appearance would make thy father wor&s;e, child, continued the Doctor. No; go back to him, and by telling him an old friend of his from London, and who has particular bu&s;ine&s;s in that part of Wales which he inha|bits, means to pay him a vi&s;it on the &s;core of ancient amity, and will take cottage fare from him in his chamber. The name of this old London friend will then be a matter of amu&s;e|ing conjecture, in the mid&s;t of which thou, child, may&s;t &s;ugge&s;t that thou &s;hould&s;t not wonder if it were me, telling him as much of the adventure that I find happened at this inn, between thee and the gentleman, who brought me thy me&s;&s;age, and with it the &s;tory of thy virtues and misfortunes, to &s;upport and to relieve which would have brought me ten times as far: but we have no time for profe&s;|&s;ion, I am come here to practi&s;e; &s;o fare thee well, my good little maid.&mdash;All that I have premi&s;ed will be the work only of an hour, at the end of which I will be with thee.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="267">She ki&s;&s;ed his hand &s;ervently, and without &s;peaking a &s;ingle word, &s;prung up, and might rather be &s;aid to fly than run to the cottage, though the paths thereto were lo&s;t in &s;now. Her father was &s;itting up in his bed, &s;upport|ed by pillows, which the aged adherent had made &s;hift to place in the ab&s;ence of his filial nur&s;e, who gently chid the old woman for tak|ing her proper bu&s;ine&s;s out of her hands; but that, if her dear father had found a moment's ea&s;e by this u&s;urpation of her natural rights, &s;he would then forgive the u&s;urper. She then entered on her errand, which &s;he managed &s;o well, as to make the old friend's name, after much plea&s;ant conjecture on both &s;ides, the &s;ubject of a wager; the father ob&s;erving, that if it &s;hould prove to belong to the Doctor, Providence had &s;ent him to reward the virtue of his daughter, who on her part maintained that it would be chiefly owing to the value which heaven it&s;elf would &s;et on her parent's life. This amicable &s;trife had put the invalid into unwonted &s;pirits, and thereby, perhaps, not only prepared the way for the cure of a fever on the nerves, but laid the be&s;t founda|tion of it. The poor gentleman did not dare to lay any &s;tre&s;s on the po&s;&s;ibility of a vi&s;it from the phy&s;ician, and yet a faint blu&s;h of
<PB N="207" REF="268">hope denoted that he &s;hould think him&s;elf mo&s;t happy to lo&s;e his wager.</P>
<P>At this au&s;picious cri&s;is it was, that our Doctor made his entr&egrave;, &s;aying, as he advanced to the bed-&s;ide, "My e&s;teemed friend, I am come to return my per&s;onal thanks to thee, for having me in thy thoughts when thou wert too &s;ick to remember any but tho&s;e who are dear to thee, and of whom thou ha&s;t a good opinion. Give me thy hand, and, without en|tering into long hi&s;tories, let us &s;ee, if in re|turn for thy kindne&s;s, I can make thee well again. Yes, this pul&s;e I fore&s;ee, before I have done with it:
<Q><L>Shall temperately keep time, and beat</L>
<L>More healthful mu&s;ic.</L></Q> Tho&s;e eyes have I &s;ee, &s;till, the &s;pirit of life in them, and this heart &s;hall yet bound with re|novated enjoyments."</P>
<P>The emotions of Amelia during the&s;e fa|vorable progno&s;tications no words can tell you. The merchant was &s;trongly affected. The Doc|tor perceived that his patient was recoverable both in the maladies of body and mind; and as he was no le&s;s a philo&s;opher and philan|thropi&s;t than a phy&s;ician, he could with equal &s;kill pre&s;cribe for each. He was one of the
<PB N="208" REF="269">people called Quakers; and to a perfect know|ledge of the world, of his profe&s;&s;ion, and of the human heart, united all the hone&s;t plainne&s;s of the character. The merchant's di&s;order was, as I have &s;aid, a fever on the &s;pirits, of which the &s;ymptoms were, as u&s;ual, want of apperite, la&s;&s;itude, watchfulne&s;s, and dejection of mind: a pul&s;e &s;low and creeping, difficulty of re&s;piration, and a dread, yet hope, of death.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that in this di&s;ea&s;e the cathartics of the mind, &s;uch as exhilerate, en|liven, and amu&s;e the patient, are the mo&s;t ef|fectual remedies, and &s;uch as were admini&s;tered with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion. In le&s;s than a fortnight, the &s;ick man not only was in a condition to leave his bed, but his chamber, and play his part in the little cottage parlour, in a thou&s;and little frolics that Amelia and the Doctor devi&s;ed to enter|tain him: in the cour&s;e of the third week, he re&s;umed his accu&s;tomed exerci&s;es; and under the cordial &s;upports of his friend and his child, he could a&s;cend the mountains that environed his habitation. In the middle of the fourth week, his &s;pirits and &s;trength were &s;o well re|&s;tored, that in returning home to dinner, after a walk of &s;ome miles, he jocularly propo&s;ed to run again&s;t the Doctor and Amelia for a
<PB N="209" REF="270">wager; which being agreed upon by the other parties, he &s;et off, and beat them both. It was in the afternoon of this victorious day, that the good Doctor intimated the nece&s;&s;ity of his return to town; good-humouredly ob&s;erv|ing, that, although by a lucky arrangement, he had left his &s;ick and wounded in very good hands with a brother phy&s;ician in London, he could not tre&s;pa&s;s any longer, without fear of being &s;et down by the college as a de&s;erter, and he mu&s;t therefore repair to head quarters in the morning.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of this was admitted: yet the merchant &s;ighed, and Amelia wept. The Doctor knew it mu&s;t be done, and he &s;aw that his prophecy, as to his friend's recovery, was fulfilled to his heart's content; but there is a &s;ympathy in generous regret, and his eyes were not more dry than Amelia's. In de&s;pite of exertions, the evening pa&s;t heavily away: the morning did not ri&s;e without ca&s;ting clouds on every countenance. The hour, the almo&s;t in&s;tant, that was to &s;eparate the cottagers from their pre&s;erver, approached.</P>
<P>Friend, &s;aid the Doctor to his patient, as he heard the wheels of his carriage advancing, &s;ince I &s;aw thee la&s;t in the great city, I have
<PB N="210" REF="271">pro&s;pered exceedingly. All tho&s;e families, to whom thou tooke&s;t me by the hand, were, more for thy &s;ake than mine, on <HI>my li&s;t.</HI> Some merit, however, or infinite good fortune, I mu&s;t needs have had, &s;ince, from an yearly gain of one hundred, I have increa&s;ed my income to &s;everal thou&s;ands per annum; and yet, I do not take fees for one in forty of my pre&s;crip|tions.&mdash;My hou&s;e is too large for my family. Wilt thou come once again into the bu&s;y world, with this mountain blo&s;&s;om, and oc|cupy &s;ome of the apartments?&mdash;This as thou wilt&mdash;At pre&s;ent I mu&s;t give thee a few words of parting advice, and mu&s;t rely on this dam|&s;el to &s;ee that it is adopted. Thou art &s;o much thy former &s;elf, friend, that I fear not a relap&s;e; but, to fortify and &s;trengthen thee in my ab&s;ence, I have written, and made up, a pre&s;cription, which, I am convinced, hits thy ca&s;e exactly. Hearing &s;omething of thy maladies from the friend who conveyed to me thy Amelia's me&s;&s;age, and forming a judgment, &s;oberly, thereupon, I brought with me &s;uch drugs as I thought could not be readily pro|cured in thy neighbourhood. They lie, how|ever, in a &s;mall compa&s;s, even in this little box, yet, being compounds of peculiar &s;trength, they will la&s;t you, I judge, for at lea&s;t a year to come, probably more&mdash;if they &s;hould not,
<PB N="211" REF="272">thou knowe&s;t where to addre&s;s the pre&s;criber for a fre&s;h &s;upply. There, friend, take it, but do not open it till you &s;eem to wi&s;h for &s;ome|thing of a <HI>cordial</HI> nature. It will then, I have no doubt, do thee good.</P>
<P>He received their tearful embraces, and de|parted. You are impatient to lift up the lid of the box. When it was opened by the mer|chant and his daughter, they di&s;covered two &s;eparate pieces of paper, each containing a draft, on a different banker, for <HI>one thou&s;and pounds</HI>&mdash;the one, a pre&s;ent from the phy&s;ician, the other from the &s;tranger who had given him an account of this little family. Wrapt round the&s;e drafts was a &s;lip of paper, in the Doctor's hand-writing, containing the&s;e words &mdash;"Tributes, from the friends of filial piety and parental love."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not deny you the gratification of knowing that the father recovered, and the child added to his ble&s;&s;ings, and her own, many years; in the &s;miling cour&s;e of which, the young lady's virtues attracted the affections of a very wealthy and worthy gentleman, who&s;e power and inclinations not only enabled the merchant to make re&s;titution of the genero&s;ity received from the phy&s;ician; but to make al&s;o
<PB N="212" REF="273">the re&s;idue of that man's life, from whom he derived the be&s;t and lovelie&s;t of wives, as happy, in pro&s;perity, as it had been re&s;pectable, in misfortune.</P>
<P>There is an air of romance about this little hi&s;tory, better &s;uited to the &s;pirit of the days of chivalry (when to &s;ally forth in <HI>que&s;t</HI> of the unhappy and of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and to relieve them, was a vital part of the educa|tion&mdash;nay, and even of the religion, of a gentleman) than to the pre&s;ent times, which, though perhaps not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for libe|ral actions, than any age what&s;oever, le&s;s en|courages that <HI>quixoti&s;m</HI> in benevolence, which marked the character of former aeras. On <HI>your</HI> heart I need not pre&s;s my repeated a&s;|&s;urances of the &s;imple truth of the above tran&s;actions. You will ea&s;ily credit words and deeds, of which you are your&s;elf &s;o capable: indeed, to <HI>your</HI> feelings there will be nothing &s;urprizing in all this, for you will follow the good old rule of judging others by your&s;elf. Nay, I am per&s;uaded, that the wonder will cea&s;e, and die away, in every heart you think fit to make partaker of the&s;e <HI>facts,</HI> when given to under&s;tand, that they proceeded from a phy&s;ician who was the means of converting an highwayman, who had <HI>violated</HI> the public
<PB N="213" REF="274">faith, into a man who was afterwards cho&s;en to <HI>guard</HI> the public faith, by holding a place of the highe&s;t <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in one of the public trea|&s;uries of his country; and that the Doctor's colleague in the bounty, &s;hewn to our merchant and his Amelia, was no le&s;s a benefactor to human kind, than the late Mr. HOWARD, who happened, on the day that he was driven for &s;helter into the village inn, which was then graced with the pre&s;ence of Amelia, to be re|turning to England from one of his u&s;ual <HI>tours of benevolence,</HI> to the different pri&s;ons of Ire|land and Wales. My friend, farewell.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XIV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>SINGULAR indeed! that you &s;hould be peru&s;ing the account of the death of the philanthropi&s;t mentioned in my la&s;t, at the moment that you received my letter, and that on the morning of the &s;ame day you &s;hould have fallen in company with Dr. ******, of who&s;e tour of loving kindne&s;s I had prepared for you &s;o ample a detail.</P>
<P>Things of this &s;ort are occa&s;ionally &s;o well|timed, that there &s;eems more in them than our
<PB N="214" REF="275">philo&s;ophy can find out. It is impo&s;&s;ible to hear that the King of Terrors has taken out of the world one of the be&s;t that ever entered it, for &s;uch Mr. John Howard unque&s;tionably was, without quitting one's &s;ubject, what&s;o|ever it might be at the time of receiving &s;uch intelligence, and fa&s;tening upon that which adds a fre&s;h proof to the certainty of that hour which is appointed for our own di&s;&s;olution. The lo&s;s of the deare&s;t objects, one by one, as they drop from us, makes, perhaps, the ap|proaches of that hour le&s;s formidable, ina&s;|much as we thereby feel our ties to life dimi|ni&s;hed. The friendly intercour&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, betwixt me and the good Howard, is among&s;t tho&s;e plea&s;ures of reflection, which, though at the pre&s;ent moment, da&s;hed by painful re|grets, will be cheri&s;hed for ever. I picked up many things re&s;pecting him well worthy of my gleaning hand in the cour&s;e of our conver|&s;ations: &s;ome of which I &s;hould &s;end you, were I not certain that there will be more than a plenty of biographers follow fa&s;t upon his funeral; and more lives, like more la&s;t dying &s;peeches, is an evil that is levied on every great man's a&s;hes. A few only of his particu|lar habits, as they occur at the moment, &s;hall wait upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="276">Howard had many &s;ingularities, but very few affectations. It was &s;ingular for mere mortal man to go about doing good for the &s;ake of doing it: to devote his fortune, and his life, to explore the mo&s;t neglected, and the mo&s;t forlorn of the wretched, and to re|lieve them "according to their &s;everal nece&s;|&s;ities"&mdash;to <HI>begin</HI> the work of benevolence, where other people's bounty commonly <HI>ends</HI> it&mdash; in a pri&s;on. All this, I &s;ay, was very &s;ingular, but wholly pure of affectation. Further, it was &s;ingular, de&s;erving that word, indeed, in|a&s;much as in human hi&s;tory&mdash;it is without a parallel&mdash;to put him&s;elf to the greate&s;t per|&s;onal inconveniences, and to encounter the greate&s;t dangers, often of life it&s;elf, to accom|pli&s;h the propo&s;ed ends of his philanthropy, &s;ince it is notorious that he traver&s;ed the earth, without any con&s;ideration of political di&s;tinc|tions, or the nature of climate, in &s;earch of his objects, by which per&s;everance and intre|pidity of re&s;olution, he overcame all impedi|ments that would have deterred many excellent per&s;ons from attempting the like enterprizes; and made even tho&s;e faint by the way, who, with like good hearts, but with le&s;s firm minds, would have found them&s;elves unequal to like undertakings: yet in Howard this was alto|gether unaffected: and before any man &s;ets
<PB N="216" REF="277">down any part of it to a love of being particu|lar, or to a love of &s;ame, ari&s;ing therefrom, let him well and truly examine his own heart, his own di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ee that he is not hunting about for an excu&s;e to his own <HI>want</HI> of benevolence, or to his own <HI>vanities,</HI> in being bountiful, by lowering the <HI>principle</HI> of benevolence in another. Let it not be imputed to John Howard, as a di&s;honour, that he had enemies, who while they could not but applaud the ble&s;&s;ed effects of his virtue, laboured to depreciate the cau&s;e: the Saviour of the whole world, whom, perhaps, of human creatures he mo&s;t correctly imitated, had the &s;ame, and to re&s;emble his divine example, even in the wrongs that were heaped on his &s;acred head, is rather glory than &s;hame.</P>
<P>He was &s;ingular in many of the common habits of life: for in&s;tance, he preferred damp &s;heets, linen, and cloaths, to dry ones, and both ri&s;ing and going to bed &s;wathed him&s;elf with coar&s;e towels dipped in the colde&s;t water he could get; in that &s;tate he remained half an hour, and then threw them off, fre&s;hened and invigorated, as he &s;aid, beyond mea&s;ure. He never put on a great coat in the colde&s;t coun|tries; nor had been a minute under or over the time of an appointment, &s;o far as it depended on him|&s;elf,
<PB N="217" REF="278">for &s;ix and twenty years. He never con|tinued at a place, or with a per&s;on, a &s;ingle day beyond the period prefixed for going, in his whole life; and he had not for the la&s;t &s;ixteen years of his exi&s;tence are any fi&s;h, fle&s;h, or fowl; nor &s;at down to his &s;imple fare of tea, milk, and ru&s;ks, all that time. His journeys were continued from pri&s;on to pri&s;on, from one groupe of wretched beings to another, night and day, and where he could not go with a carriage he would ride, and where that was hazardous he would walk. Such a thing as an ob&s;truction was out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e who, con&s;cious of want|ing in them&s;elves what they envy in others, brand this victorious determination of &s;uffer|ing no let, or hindrance, to &s;top him from keeping on in the right way, as madne&s;s. Ah, my friend, how much better would it be for their neighbours, and for &s;ociety, were they half as mad. Di&s;tractions they doubtle&s;s have, but it is to be feared, not half &s;o friendly to the intere&s;ts of human kind. But, indeed, all en|thu&s;ia&s;m of virtue is deemed romantic excen|tricity, by the cold hearted.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Mr. Howard's per&s;onal &s;in|gularities above de&s;cribed, though they were,
<PB N="218" REF="279">certainly, hazardous experiments, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, it was not u&s;ele&s;s for a man, who had pre-re&s;olved to &s;et his face again&s;t wind and weather, and after pa&s;&s;ing all &s;orts of unhealthy climes, to de&s;cend into the realms of di&s;ea&s;e and death, to make them.</P>
<P>Some days after his fir&s;t return from an at|tempt to mitigate the fury of the plague in Con&s;tantinople, he favoured me with a morn|ing vi&s;it in London; the weather was &s;o very terrible, that I had forgot his inveterate exact|ne&s;s, and had yielded up even the hope, for his own &s;ake, of expecting him. Twelve at noon was the hour, and exactly as the clock, in my room, &s;truck it, he entered; the wet, for it rained torrents, dripping from every part of his dre&s;s, like water from a &s;heep ju&s;t landed from its wa&s;hing. He would not even have attend|ed to his &s;ituation, having &s;at him&s;elf down with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, and begun conver&s;ation, had I not made an offer of dry cloaths, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>Yes, &s;aid he, &s;miling, I had my fears, as I knocked at your door, that we &s;hould go over the old bu&s;ine&s;s of apprehen&s;ions, about a little rain water, which though it does not run from off my back, as it does from that of a duck, goo&s;e, or any other aquatic bird,
<PB N="219" REF="280">it does me as little injury; and after a long drought is &s;carcely le&s;s refre&s;hing. The coat I have now on has been as often wetted through, as any duck's in the world, and, in|deed, gets no other &s;ort of cleaning. I do a&s;&s;ure you, a good &s;oaking &s;hower is the be&s;t bru&s;h for broad cloath, in the univer&s;e. You, like the re&s;t of my friends, throw away your pity upon my &s;uppo&s;ed hard&s;hips with ju&s;t as much rea&s;on, as you commi&s;erate the common beggars, who, being familiar with &s;torms and hurricanes, nece&s;&s;ity and naked|ne&s;s, are a thou&s;and times, &s;o forcible is habit, le&s;s to be compa&s;&s;ionated than the &s;ons and daughters of Ea&s;e and Luxury, who, ac|cu&s;tomed to all the enfeebling refinements of feathers by night, and fires by day, are taught to feel like the puny creature &s;tig|mati&s;ed by Pope, who &s;hivered at a breeze. All this is the work of art, my good friend; nature is more independent of external cir|cum&s;tances. Nature is intrepid, hardy, and adventurous; but it is a practice to &s;poil her, with indulgencies, from the moment we come into the world&mdash;a &s;oft dre&s;s, and &s;oft cradle, begin our education in luxuries, and we do not grow more manly the more we are grati|fied: on the contrary, our feet mu&s;t be wrapt in wool or &s;ilk, we mu&s;t tread upon carpets,
<PB N="220" REF="281">breathe, as it were, in fire, avoid a tempe&s;t, which &s;weetens the air, as we would a bla&s;t that putrifies it, and guarding every crevice from an unwhole&s;ome breeze, when it is the mo&s;t ela&s;tic and bracing, lie down upon a bed of feathers, that relax the &s;y&s;tem more than a night's lodging upon flint &s;tones.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;mile, added Mr. Howard, after a pau&s;e, but I am a living in&s;tance of the truths I in&s;i&s;t on. A more 'puny whip&s;ter' than my&s;elf, in the days of my youth, was never &s;een. I could not walk out an even|ing without wrapping up: if I got wet in the feet a cold &s;ucceeded, I could not put on my &s;hirt without its being aired, I was, politely, enfeebled enough to have delicate nerves, and was, occa&s;ionally, troubled with a very genteel hectic. To be &s;erious, I am convinced what ema&s;culates the body, debi|litates the mind, and renders both unfit for tho&s;e exertions, which are of &s;uch u&s;e to us as &s;ocial beings. I, therefore, entered upon a reform of my con&s;titution, and have &s;uc|ceeded in &s;uch a degree, that I have neither had a cough, cold, the vapors, nor any more alarming di&s;order, &s;ince I &s;urmounted the &s;ea&s;oning. Prior to this, I u&s;ed to be a
<PB N="221" REF="282">mi&s;erable dependent on wind and weather; a little too much of either would po&s;tpone, and frequently prevent&mdash;not only my amu&s;e|ments, but my duties; and every one knows that a plea&s;ure, or a duty, deferred, is often de&s;troyed. Procra&s;tination you very ju&s;tly called the Thief of Time. And if, pre&s;&s;ed by my affections, or by the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs, I did venture forth in de&s;pite of the elements, the con&s;equences were equally ab&s;urd, and incommodious, not &s;eldom afflictive. I muffled up even to my no&s;trils; a crack in the gla&s;s of my chai&s;e was &s;ufficient to di&s;tre&s;s me, a &s;udden &s;lope of the wheels to the right or left, &s;et me a trembling, a jolt &s;eemed like di&s;location, and the &s;ight of a bank or precipice, near which my hor&s;e, or carriage, was to pa&s;s, would di&s;order me &s;o much, that I would order the driver to &s;top, that I might get out and walk by the dif|ficult places. Mulled wines, &s;pirituous cor|dials, and great fires, were to comfort me, and keep out the cold, as it is called, at every &s;tage, and if I felt the lea&s;t damp in my feet, or other parts of my body, dry &s;tockings, linen, &amp;c. were to be in&s;tantly put on, the perils of the day were to be baffled by &s;ome|thing taken hot going to bed, and before I pur&s;ued my journey, the next morning, a
<PB N="222" REF="283">dram was to be &s;wallowed down to fortify the &s;tomach. In a word, I lived, moved, and had my being, &s;o much by rule, that the &s;lighte&s;t deviation was a di&s;ea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Every man, continued Mr. Howard, mu&s;t, in the&s;e ca&s;es, be his own phy&s;ician. He mu&s;t pre&s;cribe for, and practi&s;e on, him&s;elf. I did this by a very &s;imple, but as you will think, very &s;evere regimen; namely, by deny|ing my&s;elf almo&s;t every thing in which I had long indulged. But as it is always much harder to get rid of a bad habit, than to contract it, I entered on my reform gradu|ally; that is to &s;ay, I began to dimini&s;h my u&s;ual indulgencies by degrees. I found that a heavy meal, or a hearty one, as it is termed, and a chearful gla&s;s, that is to &s;ay, one more than does you good, made me inca|pable, or at be&s;t, di&s;inclined to any u&s;eful exertions, for &s;ome hours after dinner; and if the diluting powers of tea, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the work of a di&s;turbed dige&s;tion, &s;o far as to re&s;tore my faculties, a luxurious &s;upper comes &s;o clo&s;e upon it, that I was fit for nothing but di&s;&s;ipation, till I went to a lux|urious bed, where I fini&s;hed the enervating practices, by &s;leeping eight, ten, and &s;ome|times a dozen of hours on the &s;tretch.&mdash;You
<PB N="223" REF="284">will not wonder, that I ro&s;e the next morn|ing with the &s;olids relaxed, the nerves un|&s;trung, the juices thickened, and the con&s;ti|tution weakened. To remedy all this, I ate a little le&s;s at every meal, and reduced my drink in proportion. It is really wonderful to con&s;ider, how imperceptibly a &s;ingle mor&s;el of animal food, and a tea-&s;poonful of liquor deducted from the u&s;ual quantity daily, will re&s;tore the mental functions, with|out any injury to the corporeal: nay, with increa&s;e of vigour to both. I brought my|&s;elf, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, from dining upon many di&s;hes, to dining on a few, and then to being &s;atisfied with one; in like manner, in&s;tead of drinking a variety of wines, I made my election of a &s;ingle &s;ort, and adhered to it alone.</Q></P>
<P>"In the next place&mdash;but I &s;hall tire you."</P>
<P>I intreated him to go on till I either &s;hewed by words, or actions, that I was weary.</P>
<P>He proceeded thus:&mdash;<Q>My next bu&s;ine&s;s was to eat and drink &s;paringly of that adopted di&s;h and bottle. My ea&s;e, vivacity, and &s;pirits, augmented. My cloathing, &amp;c. underwent a &s;imilar reform, the effect of all which is, and has been for many years, that
<PB N="224" REF="285">I am neither affected by &s;eeing my carriage dragged up a mountain, or driven down a valley. If an accident happens, I am pre|pared for it, I mean &s;o far as re&s;pects unnece&s;|&s;ary terrors; and I am proof again&s;t all changes in the atmo&s;phere, wet cloaths, wet feet, night air, damp beds, damp hou&s;es, tran&s;itions from heat to cold, and the long train of hypochondriac affections.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Believe me, we are too apt to invert the re|medies, which we ought to pre&s;cribe to our|&s;elves&mdash;for in&s;tance, we are for ever giving hot things, when we &s;hould admini&s;ter cold. On my going down to my hou&s;e la&s;t week in Bedford&s;hire, the over&s;eer of my grounds met me with a pail full of comfortable things, as he called them, which he was carrying to one of my cows, which was afflicted &s;orely with, as he called it, a <HI>racketty</HI> complaint in her bowels. I ordered him to throw away his pail of comforts, and take to the poor bea&s;t, a pail of cold water. Cold water, your honour, exclaimed the man, with every mark of con&s;ternation! Would you kill the poor dumb creature? Why, &s;he is in &s;uch <HI>de&s;perations</HI> pain, that I don't think a bucket of &s;heer brandy, would have any more effect upon her, than if I were to pour
<PB N="225" REF="286">it again&s;t a dead wall. No matter for that, &s;aid I, take her a pail of water! Suppo&s;e, hone&s;t friend, &s;he had all her life run wild in a fore&s;t, and fell into the &s;ickne&s;s under which &s;he now labours, do&s;t thou think that nature would ever carry her the hot com|forts you have got in that pail? Nature, your honour, but with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, nature mu&s;t, when either man or bea&s;t is &s;ick, be clapped on the back a little: if not, nature will let them die. Not &s;he, truly; if they are recoverable, &s;he will, on the contrary, make them well. Depend upon it, &s;he is the be&s;t phy&s;ician in the world, though &s;he has not taken her degrees in the college; and &s;o make ha&s;te to throw away what is now in your pail, and fill it as I directed; for whe|ther my cow die or live, &s;he &s;hall have no|thing but gra&s;s and cold water. Though the poor fellow dared not any longer re&s;i&s;t, I could &s;ee plainly that he put me down, as having lo&s;t not only my &s;en&s;es, but my hu|manity. However, the cure did very well, and I am &s;atisfied, that if we were to tru&s;t more to nature, and &s;uffer her to &s;upply her own remedies, to cure her own di&s;ea&s;es, the formidable catalogue of human maladies would be reduced to a third of their pre&s;ent
<PB N="226" REF="287">number. Dr. Sydenham, I think, reckons &s;ixty different kinds of &s;evers, for example; of the&s;e I cannot &s;uppo&s;e le&s;s than fifty are either brought about, or rendered wor&s;e by mi&s;application of improper remedies, or by our own violation of the laws of nature. And the &s;ame, I take it, may be &s;aid of other di&s;orders.</Q></P>
<P>He now pulled out his watch, telling me he had an engagement at half pa&s;t one, that he had about three quarters of a mile to walk to it, that as he could do this in twenty minutes, and as it then wanted &s;even minutes and almo&s;t an half of one, he had exactly time enough &s;till to &s;pare, to &s;tate the object of his vi&s;it to me&mdash;<Q>Which is to thank you very &s;incerely, &s;aid he, taking my hand, for the honour you have done me in your ver&s;es: I read them merely as a compo&s;ition in which the poetical licence had been u&s;ed to the utmo&s;t: poets, you know, my dear Sir, always &s;ucceed be&s;t in fiction.</Q></P>
<P>You will &s;ee by this conver&s;ation, that it was about the time when the Engli&s;h nation had been emulous of commemorating their re&s;pect for this great and good man, by erect|ing a &s;tatue, towards which, I had contributed
<PB N="227" REF="288">my mite, by devoting to the fund the profits of my little Poem, called "The Triumph of Benevolence;" and while I am touched very &s;en&s;ibly with even the recollection of the public favour, which crowned this little work, I very &s;incerely attribute a great deal of its &s;ucce&s;s to the popularity of a &s;ubject in which every lover of humanity took &s;uch an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In reply to Mr. Howard, I a&s;&s;ured him, that he ought to be, and doubtle&s;s was, con|&s;cious, the liberty allowed a poet, was never more unnece&s;&s;ary, or le&s;s made u&s;e of than on the occa&s;ion alluded to, and that if an agree|able fiction was any te&s;t of the poetical art, I could pretend to none from having very clo&s;ely, as his heart could not but at that mo|ment tell him, adherred to truth: and that I a&s;&s;ured my&s;elf he would admit that truth was the &s;ame, whether expre&s;&s;ed in pro&s;e or ver&s;e. I added, it was my earne&s;t hope, there was no ground for an idea that had gone forth of his refu&s;ing the offering of gratitude, which his country were preparing for him.</P>
<P><Q>Indeed, but there is, an&s;wered he, with the mo&s;t lively earne&s;tne&s;s, I was never more &s;erious than in my refu&s;al of any and every
<PB N="228" REF="289">&s;uch offering, and for the &s;imple&s;t rea&s;on in the world; namely, my having no manner of claim to it. What I do, have done, or may hereafter do, is, has been, and will always be, matter of inclination, the gratifying which always pays it&s;elf, and I have no more merit in employing my time and money in the way I am known to do, than another man in other occupations. In&s;tead of taking plea|&s;ure in a pack of hounds, in &s;ocial entertain|ments, in a fine &s;tud of hor&s;es, and in many other &s;imilar &s;atisfactions, I have made my election of different pur&s;uits; and being fully per&s;uaded a man's own gratifications are always, more or le&s;s, involved in other people's, I feel no de&s;ire to change with any man, and yet I can &s;ee no manner of preten|&s;ion, whereon to erect a &s;tatue; be&s;ide all which, I have a mo&s;t inconquerable aver&s;ion, and ever had, to have public exhibitions made of me, in&s;omuch, that I prote&s;t to you, it has co&s;t me a great deal of trouble, and &s;ome money, to make this in&s;ignificant form and ugly face, e&s;cape a pack of draft&s;men, painters, &amp;c. that are lying in wait for me.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Unle&s;s you had per&s;onally known Mr. Howard, it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould have the &s;malle&s;t idea of the plea&s;ant manner with
<PB N="229" REF="290">which he &s;poke on his own per&s;onal &s;ubject.&mdash;
<Q>I have detected a fellow at work upon this face of mine, ugly as it is, &s;aid he, even as I have been walking in the &s;treets of Lon|don; and if a hackney-coach has been within call, I have popped into it, drawn up the blinds, and &s;at &s;nug, till I got to my own door, and then I have leaped out, and run into my own hou&s;e, as if I was appre|hen&s;ive a bailiff was at my heels. Nay, I have often had my door it&s;elf infe&s;ted by a lurking arti&s;t, who was literally in wait to take me off. But one day, &s;ince my return, a trick I played one of the&s;e takers off di|verted me exce&s;&s;ively. You mu&s;t know I am a great gaper at the novelties that are continually pre&s;ented at the print-&s;hops in this great city; I was &s;tanding at that of Carrington Bowles, in St. Paul's Church|yard, the other day, to look at &s;ome political caricatures very plea&s;antly executed, when, happening to ca&s;t my eye &s;ide-long, I di&s;co|vered a fellow operating on my phiz with all his might. Perceiving him&s;elf caught in the fact, he lowered his paper, and pretended to be, like my&s;elf and a number of others, looking only at the prints. I was ju&s;t then in the humour to pay off this deception by another, &s;o &s;eeming, like him, to be wholly
<PB N="230" REF="291">engro&s;&s;ed by a figure, called Scotch Oeco|nomy, well calculated to provoke the ri&s;ible mu&s;cles, I threw mine into &s;uch contortions, and gave &s;uch &s;udden changes from one de|formity to another, that had my painter etched any one of my features in its then po|&s;ition, the re&s;emblance betwixt my actual &s;elf and the copy, would have been ju&s;t as &s;trik|ing, as&mdash;I could de&s;ire it to be. The painter, however, at length perceived the &s;tratagem, and &s;miling, as if he gave me credit for it, put his pencil into his pocket and went away. I own I enjoyed the joke, and have &s;ince practi&s;ed it, more than once, with no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>You will, doubtle&s;s, throw the&s;e &s;allies among&s;t his &s;ingularities, my friend, but they are by no means to be &s;tigmatized as affecta|tions. From a very intent ob&s;ervation on Mr. Howard, I am perfectly &s;atisfied, that as he had but few who <HI>acted</HI> like him&s;elf, the proportion of tho&s;e who <HI>felt</HI> in the &s;ame way the ordinary re&s;ults of &s;uch actions were not greater. That he was in&s;en&s;ible to hone&s;t prai&s;e cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, without depriving him of emo|tions which the mo&s;t ingenuous mode&s;ty may indulge, and which are indeed among&s;t the mo&s;t natural plea&s;ures of the human mind; but
<PB N="231" REF="292">to court the <HI>reputation</HI> of benevolence, by &s;uf|fering the lucre of it to mix with any of his motives, or, &s;till wor&s;e, to make it, as alas too many people do, a fir&s;t great cau&s;e of being bountiful, argues an envy or a depravity in tho&s;e who impute to him &s;uch vanities. In a word, if ever a human being could be truly &s;aid to "do good, and blu&s;h to find it fame," it was the late Mr. John Howard.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume you have heard, that, among&s;t his other &s;ingularities, is to be enumerated his generous care of his &s;uperannuated hor&s;es. He had a range of pa&s;tures &s;acred to the old age of tho&s;e who had carried him plea&s;antly, or worked for him hone&s;tly and indu&s;triou&s;ly, till they were no longer fit for &s;ervice. This is the moment when hor&s;es are, in general, either &s;old at an under price to people who are con|&s;trained to allow no touch of pity to predomi|nate over that charity which begins at home, or el&s;e they are de&s;troyed, and given to the dogs, their ma&s;ters alledging that it is an act of humanity. Our Philanthropi&s;t's humanity never leading him to kill an old &s;ervant, he turns his u&s;ele&s;s hor&s;es into the afore&s;aid pa&s;tures, where they remain happy pen&s;ioners on his bounty for the re&s;t of their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="293">I was much delighted on walking over tho&s;e grounds with the generous ma&s;ter of them, to &s;ee twenty or thirty of the&s;e quadruped pen|&s;ioners, enjoying them&s;elves in perfect free|dom from labour, and in full &s;upply of all that old age requires. Each of the fields has a com|fortable &s;hed, where the inhabitants can re&s;ort to in the hard weather, and are &s;ure of finding the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on &s;oftened by a well|furni&s;hed crib of the be&s;t hay, and a manger either of bran, or corn, ground, or &s;ome other nouri&s;hing food. Chel&s;ea ho&s;pital is not better accommodated: the day on which I made the circuit of the pa&s;tures was one of the fine&s;t of Augu&s;t; &s;ome of the pen&s;ioners were renovating in the &s;un, others repo&s;ing in the &s;hade; but on the approach of their benefactor, all of them, actuated by a &s;pirit of gratitude worthy of imitation, that could move with ea&s;e, came towards him, invited his attentions, and &s;eemed very &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation. Some, who&s;e limbs almo&s;t refu&s;ed their offices, put them|&s;elves to no &s;mall difficulties to limp towards him, and even tho&s;e, who, being confined to their hovels, might be fairly &s;aid to be bed|ridden, turned their languid eyes to him, and appeared &s;en&s;ible of his pity, and care&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="294"><Q>The&s;e have been all very faithful creatures, Sir, &s;aid he, and who have &s;trong claims upon me: that poor fellow, who has now &s;carce a leg to &s;tand upon, was the con&s;tant com|panion of my peregrinations for &s;ix and twenty years, and was as proud and prancing, as he is now humble and decrepid; and the iron grey invalid, which you &s;ee yonder, dragging his &s;low length along, was in the days of his youth &s;uch a roving, riotous fellow, that no gate or hedge could keep him within bounds, and it was a day's work &s;ometimes to catch him; nay, when he was caught, it required more addre&s;s and hor&s;eman&s;hip than ever I was ma&s;ter of, to make him under&s;tand, that the philo&s;ophy of a par&s;on's pad, had more charms for me than all the flights of Bucephalus, or even of Pega&s;us him&s;elf. Look at him now. The morality of the contra&s;t is obvious.</Q></P>
<P>In this manner he went on, enumerating the &s;everal qualities, and hi&s;torical anecdotes of the &s;everal pen&s;ioners. The one la&s;t de&s;cribed, he told me,
<Q>was at no time a hor&s;e for him, and would not probably have been among&s;t his pen&s;ioners, but that he had been once rode by a relation of his, a young agreeable rake,
<PB N="234" REF="295">who valued him for the very points that made him u&s;ele&s;s to me, his &s;kitti&s;hne&s;s, and impe|tuo&s;ity; all which he a&s;&s;erted, were the &s;ure marks, both in man and bea&s;t of a generous &s;pirit, high heart, and noble di&s;po&s;ition. Now, as my little frolic-loving cou&s;in was preci&s;ely of this character him&s;elf, and after a mad, but not vicious, career of fifteen years, con&s;olidated into a very good man, I &s;uffered the hor&s;e and his ma&s;ter to reform them&s;elves at lei&s;ure, and wi&s;h with all my &s;oul, that half the reformed rakes about town, had turned out &s;o well, after &s;owing their wild oats, as did this young gentleman, and his favourite &s;teed, who, for the eight la&s;t years of his &s;ervitude, was a pattern of &s;o|briety to hor&s;es and riders.</Q></P>
<P>I do not recollect any other &s;ingularities re|&s;pecting this extraordinary man: but if what I have here &s;et down, gives you a curio&s;ity for more, I have no doubt but it will be amply gratified, as there needs no gho&s;t to foretel us, there will be an hi&s;torian for almo&s;t every anec|dote and incident in his life! Luckily he is one of the &s;ubjects, which can never be exhau&s;ted, and as Dr. John&s;on once &s;aid to me of his friend Gold&s;mith,&mdash;"he was one who cannot be too much prai&s;ed or lamented." And
<PB N="235" REF="296">never, perhaps, was the famous expre&s;&s;ion of Hamlet more applicable, though quoted on ten thou&s;and occa&s;ions, than to Howard&mdash;

<P>IT is a very high &s;atisfaction to give you plea&s;ure, it increa&s;es my obligations to you, for it increa&s;es my happine&s;s. Your la&s;t letter, therefore, wherein you expre&s;s &s;o vivid a &s;en&s;e of the Howardine &s;craps I &s;ent you, could not but be mo&s;t welcome: neither can I refu&s;e the flattering compliment you pay to my mu&s;e, in de&s;iring a copy of the tributary ver&s;es &s;he paid to our Great Philanthropi&s;t, at the time that the Briti&s;h empire, which he &s;o much adorned and dignified, was preparing its memorial of national exultation. You tell me, that you have applied to the book&s;ellers, and to the publi&s;her of that little poem in vain. Had I known your wi&s;hes, I could have prevented your having any trouble to gratify them on this occa&s;ion, having long known the poem was
<PB N="236" REF="297">out of print, and as long been applied to for &s;ending it again to the pre&s;s, but the &s;ale of the former editions, having an&s;wered the end of &s;omething enlarging the fund, which was intended to defray the expences of the &s;tatue, and that de&s;ign being &s;u&s;pended by Mr. Howard's wi&s;h, that it might not be carried into execution, I con&s;idered that the &s;ubject was too local to warrant a re-publication, when that locality was taken away: among&s;t a few partial friends, therefore, I di&s;tributed the copies that remained of the pre&s;ent, which was made me by the committee, who publi&s;hed the poem, and re&s;erving only a &s;ingle copy for my|&s;elf, I thought no more about it. The death, however, of the meritorious man, who was the &s;ubject; the report that prevails of the commit|tee's completing a de&s;ign, which can no longer affect the delicacy of Mr. Howard; the plea&s;ure I take in obeying your commands; and the de|&s;ire I have to pre&s;erve my tribute to this excel|lent character, in my corre&s;pondence with you, united with the confidence which the approba|tion of the world on the original publi&s;hing, gives me, are all motives &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive that to combat with, or to re&s;i&s;t them might appear an affectation more unpardonable than the in|dulgence of my vanity, at a moment, when it is connected with my duty to the dead, my
<PB N="237" REF="298">friend&s;hip for the living, and my gratitude to the public. It is under &s;uch &s;upports and &s;uf|frages, I republi&s;h in this place, my dear friend, "THE TRIUMPH OF BENEVOLENCE," not, however, from the re&s;erved copy I &s;poke of, but from memory, that copy being among&s;t the manu&s;cripts, mi&s;&s;ing or lo&s;t, &s;tolen or &s;trayed, with my trunks, who, as well as my|&s;elf, have been upon their travels, but by a &s;et of <HI>contretems,</HI> have not been my <HI>fellow</HI> travel|lers. I hope, however, as among&s;t other mat|ters, they contain the literary labours of &s;ome years, not yet publi&s;hed, including the mate|rials for "Society," on which the public have a claim, I hope, I &s;ay, we &s;hall meet ere it be long, like old friends, and part no more;&mdash;the rather as &s;ome of the characters in tho&s;e un|fini&s;hed performances, are left in a very forlorn &s;ituation, out of which no hand, but mine, can properly extricate them. A heroine is in a a deep &s;woon, and a hero at his la&s;t ga&s;p, in tragedy, but can neither die, or recover with|out my a&s;&s;i&s;tance: two whole families are thrown into a labyrinth of perplexities, and have no chance of extrication, but from the author, who involved them, but who was "cruel only to be kind." In &s;hort, all the&s;e good people, are wandering in their &s;everal di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and look to me only for con&s;olation:
<PB N="238" REF="299">join with me, therefore, I beg of you, that they may &s;peedily be conducted from the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> roads of life&mdash;pardon the pun, for the &s;ake of having the philo&s;ophy of &s;port with my misfortune&mdash; and, by making u&s;e of the enclo&s;ed clue, help me to &s;et them in the right way.</P>

<P>My friend, I have obeyed you.

How infinitely touching is an idea of this &s;ort of deprivation! How anxiou&s;ly does the &s;oul fly about for &s;uccour on &s;uch occa&s;ions!

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>ANCIENT manners are le&s;s worn away by time, and the varying modes of life in Wales, than in mo&s;t other countries. There is a harper in almo&s;t every village, and more than a bard to every mountain. The poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m has de&s;cended from the earlie&s;t to the late&s;t generation, with no lo&s;s of its origi|nal fervor, at lea&s;t; for the Cambrian poets have monthly meetings and annual fe&s;tivals, on which there is a &s;trife in rhime which makes the very rocks poetical. I received a card of invitation to one of the&s;e, and was much amu&s;ed with the novelty of the cere|mony. About a hundred and thirty bards
<PB N="250" REF="311">a&s;&s;embled at a public hou&s;e, in the village of Penmorva, in Merioneth&s;hire. Twelve judges were appointed to decide of the &s;uperiority of the poems, the &s;ix be&s;t of which were to have prizes, the one an arm-chair, decorated with the en&s;igns of Apollo; a &s;econd a chaplet of laurels be&s;pread with gold leaf, and &s;o on: only five-and-twenty bards were to recite, and each recitation not to exceed twenty minutes. This I &s;oon found was a very proper re&s;tric|tion, for had the poe&s;y been equal to the vehe|mence of delivering it, had the &s;en&s;e echoed to the &s;ound, Phoebus him&s;elf might have been proud of his votaries. It was, however, a very merry a&s;&s;ociation; and though only half a dozen could obtain prizes, every man went away about day-light, well &s;atisfied with others and with him&s;elf; for if each happy candidate was plea&s;ed with pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, each unlucky one was whi&s;pered to by his &s;elf-love, that the next meeting would atone for the di&s;appointment. Thus,
<Q>"Not a vanity is given in vain."</Q> and we are to be convinced of every thing but our want of merit in the art we cultivate. This good opinion of our&s;elves is not only to be reckoned among&s;t the painted clouds that beautify our days, but incites us to indu&s;try and emulation in the &s;cience or occupation we pur&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="312">The bards of old are too famous, and you are too well read in their &s;tory, as it has been given in modern and ancient performances, to &s;tand in need of much information. Old Ca|radoc (Craddock) of Lancarvon, who&s;e book was originally written in Briti&s;h, and <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> in Engli&s;h, by Doctor Powel, as it is quaintly called, has furni&s;hed the be&s;t, as well as the earlie&s;t account of them; and it appears that one of the ancient Princes of Wales, named Gruffydth (Griffith) ap Conan, who died about the year 1136, to the grief and di&s;content of all his &s;ubjects, among&s;t other whole&s;ome laws and &s;tatutes enacted in his time, reformed the di&s;orders and abu&s;es of the Welch min&s;trels.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e min&s;trels there were three &s;orts; the fir&s;t compo&s;ed &s;everal &s;ongs and odes of various mea&s;ure, wherein, &s;ays Craddock, appeared not only the poet's &s;kill, but al&s;o a vein, which the Latins call Furor Poeticus. The&s;e of the fir&s;t order likewi&s;e kept the records of the gentle|men's arms and pedigrees (a very &s;acred tru&s;t among&s;t the&s;e de&s;cendants of Cadwallader in former times) on which account they were held in great veneration both by their brother poets and by the people. The next were &s;uch as played upon in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, chiefly the harp and the crowd, the latter of which
<PB N="252" REF="313">Prince Griffith, who de&s;cended from Iri&s;h pa|rents, and was born in Ireland, brought over with him from that country; and who, not contented with giving his Welch &s;ubjects the in&s;trument, &s;ent over for &s;ome of the be&s;t per|formers upon it; and, although the Welch con|tend for the honour of the invention, it &s;eems to belong principally to tho&s;e very Hibernians. The la&s;t &s;ort of Welch min&s;trels and bards were to &s;ing to an in&s;trument played by another. Each of the&s;e, by the &s;ame &s;tatute, held their &s;everal rewards and encouragements allotted them: their life and behaviour was to be &s;potle&s;s, otherwi&s;e their puni&s;hment was very &s;evere, every one, on proof of a well-founded complaint, having authority to correct them, even to a deprivation of all they had. They were al&s;o interdicted entering any man's hou&s;e, or to compo&s;e any &s;ong upon any one, without the &s;pecial leave and warrant of the party concerned.</P>
<P>The&s;e regulations gave virtue to amu&s;ement, by adding morality to mu&s;ic and poetry. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, although the harmony, as well &s;ocial, as vocal and in&s;trumental, &s;till remains in a certain degree, the morality, &s;o far as &s;obriety and temperance is a part of ethics, is a little the wor&s;e for wear. The or|gies
<PB N="253" REF="314">of Bacchus generally fini&s;h tho&s;e of Apollo at the fe&s;tivals of the modern Welch min&s;trels, who, after the poetic trials of the day, eat and drink like &s;o many aldermen at a turtle fea&s;t. Formerly bard and min&s;trel united in the &s;ame per&s;on, at lea&s;t frequently: at pre&s;ent, the harper and the poet are, for the mo&s;t part, di&s;tinct. The poet, like the harper, is &s;till welcome where&s;oever he goes; they both migrate in a plea&s;ant wandering kind of life, from one place to another, mak|ing &s;ometimes a circuit of their neighbouring hills and vallies, and &s;ometimes of the whole principality. They travel with the harp at their backs, or their works in their pockets. They enter a hou&s;e without invitation, and are con&s;idered as one of the family while they &s;tay, which is &s;eldom le&s;s than a week at a time. If any little dome&s;tic incident happens while they are inmates, it is celebrated on the &s;pot: if the event be fortunate, the bard greets it by a gay and &s;pirited impromptu; and the harper hails it with his mo&s;t lively ditty. If it is di&s;tre&s;sful, they commemorate it by an extemporaneous elegy, and attempt to &s;often it by &s;oothing &s;ounds. The marriage of children, the death or &s;ickne&s;s of parents, a fair pro&s;|pect of harve&s;t, an untimely fro&s;t, and, in &s;hort, almo&s;t every change and chance of hu|man
<PB N="254" REF="315">life is either gratulated or bewailed. This practice is not without its u&s;e; it excites to good neighbourhood; it prevents the indu&s;tri|ous labourer, as well as his employers, from wandering abroad for tho&s;e relaxations and recreations which they find at home. The village hinds and hu&s;bandmen can have a dance and &s;ong at their own cottages and farms, and all the family is regaled, invigo|rated, and amu&s;ed, at a very &s;mall charge, merely that of the occa&s;ional entertainment of the bard and harper: on a &s;cale of comparative expence, how much cheaper, as well as more free from hazard, is this, than the county town balls, to which the high-dre&s;&s;ed farmers daugh|ters repair monthly in chai&s;es, or on their brothers' hunters, in all the extravagance of the late&s;t fa&s;hions ridiculou&s;ly imitated? In a word, tho&s;e mu&s;ico-poetical vagabonds are a very happy and u&s;eful &s;et of people; and it is wonderfully plea&s;ant for a re&s;identiary tra|veller, particularly if he is al&s;o a perambu|lating one, to be &s;ure not only of ho&s;pitable reception, but to be gratified with mu&s;ic and &s;ong into the bargain where&s;oever he makes a pau&s;e; for it may very truly be &s;aid in this country, that "every &s;tranger finds a ready chair." With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I have to render my acknowledgments even to &s;ome of
<PB N="255" REF="316">the untoward accidents of life for carrying me into &s;everal agreeable &s;cenes and adventures: for in&s;tance, a &s;hower, a &s;udden turn of wea|ther from inten&s;e heat to cold, or <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;,</HI> a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from a town or inn; thir&s;t, hunger, or the want of any thing that offers but the &s;hadow of an apology for mak|ing another's hou&s;e my own, has often been matter of felicitation to all parties; and I have &s;ometimes &s;ought the &s;helter of a few mi|nutes, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to quit it for days. The harper always gives a ze&s;t to every meal by a tune; and in the evening, the bard, though often an unlettered votary of the mu&s;e, offers the be&s;t poetry he has to be&s;tow. The bre|vity and di&s;patch are recommendations in the wor&s;t of times, for while a jug of ale or cyder is drinking, the bard will make a &s;tanza of grati|tude for it. While &s;upper is dre&s;&s;ing, he is ready to &s;erve it up with a copy of ver&s;es in prai&s;e of Benevolence. And though it may happen, that neither the mu&s;ic nor the poetry have charms for the fa&s;tidious critic; they are not de&s;titute of attraction for the philanthropi&s;t.</P>
<P>The northern part of the principality is &s;aid to have been the mo&s;t famous, at all times, as it is at pre&s;ent, for the bards. A very cu|rious contention, indeed, is reported to have
<PB N="256" REF="317">taken place, betwixt the North and South poets, in 1176. Lord Rhys (Rice) Prince of South Wales, &s;ays the hi&s;tory, made a very great fea&s;t at Chri&s;tmas, in his ca&s;tle of Aber|trifi, which he cau&s;ed to be proclaimed through all Britain, Ireland, and the i&s;lands adjacent, &s;ome con&s;iderable time before; and according to his invitation, many hundreds of Engli&s;h, Normans, and others, were very honourably received, and courteou&s;ly entertained. Among&s;t other tokens of their welcome, the prince cau&s;ed all the poets throughout all Wales to come to his ca&s;tle, and for a better diver&s;ion to the company, he provided chairs to be &s;et in the hall, in which the bards being &s;eated, they were to an&s;wer each other in rhime; and tho&s;e that overcame the re&s;t in this pitched engagement of poetical repartee, were reward|ed with rich pre&s;ents. The North Wales bards obtained the victory, with the applau&s;e of the whole company; and among&s;t the harpers al&s;o, between whom there was a &s;imilar &s;trife, the prince's own &s;ervants were accounted the mo&s;t expert.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure I did not fail to include, among&s;t the objects of my mo&s;t accurate at|tention, the mo&s;t attractive of all that Cambria in ancient times mo&s;t venerated, the Druids.
<PB N="257" REF="318">In my re&s;earches on this fruitful &s;ubject, though I was very highly gratified, I found nothing &s;ufficiently new to glean. A tour through Angle&s;ea, which I made in the com|pany of a very intelligent man, who, luckily for my purpo&s;e, was mounted on a hor&s;e, that, like my own, had long &s;ince adopted the mode of deliberate travelling, pre&s;ented to me a full view of all the reliques of druidical anti|quity &s;till to be &s;een in the i&s;land. The places of &s;acrifice, where the blood of human vic|tims was devoted, by craft, to &s;uper&s;tition, the enormous pile of rocks, under which they erected their &s;anguinary altars, the now craggy heaths once covered with their temples, and the remains of tho&s;e immen&s;e woods wherein they performed their tremendous rites, were all vi&s;ited with an eagerne&s;s of curio&s;ity which the &s;ubject is &s;o well fitted to in&s;pire. I really felt a &s;acred kind of horror as I traver&s;ed the i&s;le, celebrated for &s;o many ages as the theatre of religious rapine; and although at every &s;tep I was reminded of &s;ome act more cha|racteri&s;tic of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or of a murderous ban|ditti, than of the mini&s;ters of a religion pure and peaceful, at every &s;tep I experienced that &s;olemn &s;en&s;ation which mixes it&s;elf with every object of antiquity, over which poetry has thrown a charm. The power of the mu&s;e
<PB N="238" REF="319">is manife&s;ted, perhaps, more in this than in any thing el&s;e. In that &s;ober &s;tate of the mind which fits us for &s;eeing objects in their natural &s;ize and colour, whether we are read|ing or reflecting, a fact is decided upon by rea&s;on, and pronounced either good or evil, according to its actual tendency. From this deci&s;ion one would &s;uppo&s;e there could be no appeal: pre&s;ently there comes a fair u&s;urper, called Imagination, who, by the &s;lighte&s;t wavering of her wand, hurls rea&s;on from the throne, vaults into it her&s;elf, and governs with a &s;overeignty, at once, &s;o ab&s;olute and agree|able, that we deliver up our&s;elves to her en|chantment, and even a&s;&s;i&s;t her in dragging the lawful monarch at the wheels of her chariot, in which we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be carried over fairy land, the happy &s;laves of her u&s;urped au|thority.</P>
<P>Thus only can we account for the venera|tion we bear towards tho&s;e who&s;e memory is &s;tained by deeds which rea&s;on mu&s;t for ever condemn. I was not to learn that the I&s;le of Angle&s;y was the chief haunt of tho&s;e barba|rous beings, who&s;e de&s;poti&s;m and cruelty &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed the rage of the panther, fami&s;hing for prey; that a more bloody race of ruffians never infe&s;ted humanity than the Druids; that they
<PB N="259" REF="320">covered the mo&s;t horrid enormities with the impenetrable ma&s;k of religion; and yet &s;o ef|fectually had Ma&s;on, and other poets, a&s;&s;i&s;ted our love of antiquity, to make us go over to the &s;ide of imagination, that I honoured the very name of Mona, and looked at the re|liques of the woods and caves, which had &s;o often re&s;ounded with the my&s;terious incan|tations, with a not unplea&s;ing horror. Thus fa&s;cinated,
<Q><L>"Ev'ry old poetic mountain</L>
<L>"In&s;piration breath'd around,</L>
<L>"Ev'ry &s;hade and hallow'd fountain</L>
<L>"Murmur'd deep a &s;olemn &s;ound;"</L></Q> and even in places, where, had the mind been un&s;educed, I &s;hould have &s;huddered at the bare remembrance of the enormities practi&s;ed therein,
<Q><L>"Bright-ey'd fancy, hov'ring o'er,</L>
<L>"Scatter'd from her pictur'd urn,</L>
<L>"Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn."</L></Q> Such are the triumphs over the mu&s;e. We are called rea&s;onable beings, my friend: but how va&s;t is the empire of imagination, and how &s;weet is our captivity! What a pity that it &s;hould &s;o often be fal&s;e and fatal! To you may fancy ever be a friend, and in connection with rea&s;on; or if they ever &s;eparate, be it only like the parting of much-loved a&s;&s;ociates,
<PB N="260" REF="321">who make &s;hort excur&s;ions to different places, but return &s;oon into the arms of each other! or while fancy carries you into adventures, may Mentor ever attend on Telemachus!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>TO the &s;uper&s;tition of the Welch <HI>mountains,</HI> may be added that of their <HI>lakes</HI> and monumental &s;tones. The former are ex|tremely numerous; but a countle&s;s variety of fables mingle in the hi&s;tory of each. The &s;tones are of &s;uch prodigious magnitude, that they are not likely to be moved, but by that commotion which &s;hall &s;ubdue the world it&s;elf; they are of &s;uch incredible bulk, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing by what united power they were at fir&s;t dragged to the cloud-capped hills on which they &s;tand; and have &s;tood for many centuries. A traveller who tells you the &s;ingle &s;tones mea|&s;ured from &s;even, eight, to ten, and &s;ixteen feet high, is mode&s;tly within the truth; and it is al&s;o true, that fifty yoke of oxen could not po&s;&s;ibly move &s;ome of them, much le&s;s climb with them up the fearful a&s;cents, whereon they certainly were originally placed by human art
<PB N="261" REF="322">and labour. No wonder, therefore, that the traditionary account of the pea&s;antry is, that the devil him&s;elf &s;et them up there. And of the mountains them&s;elves, on the very &s;ummit of which the&s;e enormous &s;tones are piled one upon another, it has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, their re&s;emblance is &s;o great to the Alps, that, except the language of the people, a traveller could hardly avoid thinking he is pa&s;&s;ing from Gre|noble to Su&s;a, or through the country of the Gri&s;ons; but with this exception, that in abun|dance of places you have the mo&s;t beautiful val|lies in the world, and &s;ome of them of very great extent, far exceeding tho&s;e &s;o famed among&s;t the mountains of Piedmont and Savoy.</P>
<P>The Welch are of a mo&s;t inqui&s;itive temper. They &s;tare, and flock round a &s;tranger, as if he were the inhabitant of another world, ju&s;t ar|rived among&s;t them. If he makes the &s;lighte&s;t advance to di&s;cour&s;e, they ply him with que&s;|tions, and are never &s;atisfied with an&s;wers, till they unlock every part of his hi&s;tory. At fir&s;t I took this to be confined to a few curious people; but I found, in the end, it was the cu&s;tom of the country. You meet a Welchman on the road, or join him in the chat of a mi|nute at your inn&mdash;"Whence come you? where go you? what is your name? where were you
<PB N="262" REF="323">born? what is the object of your journey? are you in bu&s;ine&s;s? are you out of it? how long have you been from home? how long do you &s;tay abroad? are you a &s;ingle man? have you a family?" are interrogatories that tread on the heels of the fir&s;t &s;alutation; and the&s;e, if re|plied to, are followed by others, more clo&s;e, and, if po&s;&s;ible, more impertinent. Nor have you any way of &s;haking the enquirers off, but by an inveterate &s;ilence, and this they re&s;ent by &s;uch a torrent of fre&s;h queries, that even &s;ilence is no &s;ecurity; and you mu&s;t either bear to hear all they have to a&s;k, or take refuge in retreat. Horace's trouble&s;ome fellow was not more importunate. But all this is without the &s;malle&s;t intention to offend; on the con|trary, it is often with a de&s;ign to be &s;ociable; but chiefly, I believe, has no motive better or wor&s;e than the gratification of &s;imple curio&s;ity. It is, however, very worrying, and has now and then provoked me to an&s;wer &s;harply. At a place called Towy, a man, whom I met, at the inn where I baited, &s;o urged me with que&s;tion upon que&s;tion, that I was malicious enough to put the mo&s;t bitter &s;arca&s;ms into my re&s;pon&s;es. Que&s;tion&mdash;Where did I come from? An&s;wer, The other world. Where was I going?&mdash;Out of hearing. What was my name?&mdash;Namele&s;s. Where was I born?&mdash;In the moon.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="324">Till this an&s;wer the fellow did not &s;eem to feel that I was laughing at him; but it had the effect, for he &s;oon after ended his per&s;ecutions, by &s;aying, come from where I will, I was a merry gentleman, and he wi&s;hed me good day.</P>
<P>If ever you &s;hould be &s;prighted by one of the&s;e Welch queri&s;ts, or by a vexer of this de|&s;cription in any country, my plan may be worth adoption. You might be led to &s;uppo&s;e this over-curious propen&s;ity was in the way of their ho&s;pitable turn of character, but if you can agree with me, that it originates not in any &s;u&s;|picion or fear of deceit, you will place it in the long li&s;t of <HI>incon&s;i&s;tencies,</HI> which blend in human characters, without conceiving it to be a paradox. How often do we meet the mo&s;t apparently, nay ab&s;olutely, incompatible pro|perties compound them&s;elves in the &s;ame mind? avarice with prodigality, pride with hu|mility, charity with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, vanity with diffidence, and a love of the world with pro|found retirement. I could illu&s;trate each of the&s;e apparent contradictions by proofs <HI>per&s;onal</HI> taken from the catalogue of our mutual ac|quaintance, but what better would be inferred than &s;o many fre&s;h convictions of the olde&s;t fact, that the be&s;t people re &s;trange com|pounds,
<PB N="264" REF="325">and that the world is a garden where not only, in a <HI>general</HI> &s;en&s;e,
<Q>"Weeds and flowers promi&s;cuous &s;hoot,"</Q> but where, by the &s;ide of the faire&s;t, &s;weete&s;t, flower, and almo&s;t twi&s;ted round it, grows that weed, which is mo&s;t baneful to it: one would think they could not live, or thrive in the &s;ame &s;oil; yet we perceive they flouri&s;h very neigh|bourly together. Have you never, my dear friend, found the ro&s;e and nettle take root in the &s;ame temper?&mdash;the fragrance and beauty of the one incommoded by the &s;tinging proper|ties of the other? Yes, you reply, but then it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the gardener, Education, to pluck up this ill-a&s;&s;orted a&s;&s;ociate, and to leave the ro&s;e to blo&s;&s;om either in &s;olitude, or better &s;ociety. In vegetable culture, this may always do; in moral gardening, it is to be managed nicely, le&s;t in eradicating a favourite folly, or con&s;titutional weakne&s;s, we injure the native virtue that is near it. No, my friend, we mu&s;t be content rather with meliorating the &s;oil, than de&s;troying its natural productions; if &s;ome of the&s;e are utterly obnoxious to the valuable plants and &s;hrubs, which are the pride and riches of the ground, they <HI>"mu&s;t</HI> be hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire," for <HI>&s;uch</HI> "tares will to|tally choak the wheat; <HI>"&s;uch</HI> weeds will bla&s;t
<PB N="265" REF="326">the ro&s;e wor&s;e than a canker; but if they are le&s;s ambitious of doing mi&s;chief; if they are all but the frailties of our nature, &s;pringing up among&s;t our virtues, let them be con&s;idered as forming the ti&s;&s;ue of the human character; where the coar&s;e and fine, the wor&s;ted, and the &s;ilk, are nece&s;&s;ary to the general &s;trength of the piece:
<Q><L>"When &s;traw-like errors lean to virtue's &s;ide,</L>
<L>"Ah! check ye bigots, check your &s;urious pride,</L>
<L>"Some venial faults, from &s;ordid nature &s;tart,</L>
<L>"And &s;pring up only in the generous heart;</L>
<L>"As florid weeds elude the labourer's toil,</L>
<L>"From too much warmth and richne&s;s of the &s;oil;</L>
<L>"While meaner &s;ouls, like Zembla's hills of &s;now,</L>
<L>"Too barren prove for weeds or flowers to blow."</L>
<BIBL>SYMPATHY.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Your pardon for this &s;elfi&s;h quotation. Is it not in point? It repeats, perhaps, the allu&s;ion, but it &s;eems to gain force by the repetition. It is &s;o exce&s;&s;ively painful to be finding fault with poor human nature, continually, that it is quite a relief to one to plead her cau&s;e, and become her apologi&s;t for tho&s;e tre&s;pa&s;&s;es which are at all defen&s;ible. Heaven knows there are plenty of <HI>faux pas,</HI> where, to attempt her ex|cu&s;e, would be to partake her crimes.</P>
<P>Be &s;atisfied, then, that the con&s;titutional ho&s;pitality of the Welch receives no check
<PB N="266" REF="327">from their con&s;titutional inqui&s;itivene&s;s: the former is, indeed, &s;o very general, that the &s;tory, which a gentleman, who made the tour of Wales in 1774, relates, is not in the lea&s;t to be doubted. It is told to &s;hew that a man may travel, through the whole country, with a con&s;tant &s;uite of recommendations from one ho&s;pitable hou&s;e to another. The &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory is this: a gentleman of the neigh|bourhood of Mahuntleth, a little town in the extreme We&s;t angle of Montgomery&s;hire, and which I de&s;cribed to you in one of my letters, in|troduced him&s;elf politely to the company, and hearing they travelled to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity, civilly offered to gratify it. They a&s;ked him, if there was a good hou&s;e at the next &s;tage? He an&s;wered, there were many; Mr. Lloyd's, Mr. Powell's, Mr. Edward's, &amp;c.&mdash;They &s;till required which was the be&s;t hou&s;e? He re|plied they were all very good. To make him explicit, they per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;king him, whether either of them was as comfortable, and proper, as that in which they were conver&s;ing, mean|ing the village inn.&mdash;Sir, &s;aid he, with a peevi&s;h &s;urprize, &s;hould you take this hou&s;e for a gentleman's? They quickly explained them&s;elves, and begged his pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="328">It would be unju&s;t in me to omit telling you, that the Welch are not only lovers of ho&s;pitality in them&s;elves, but &s;incere admirers of it in others, and if a kindne&s;s has once been &s;hewn them, they never lo&s;e the impre&s;&s;ion of it. One in&s;tance, out of many, I will recount. In the vicinity of Caernarvon, is one of the &s;eats of my Lord Newborough. Pa&s;&s;ing this, one mi&s;erably cold day, when the &s;nows were frozen on the mountains, I could not help ex|claiming, in the hearing of the hone&s;t Welch|man, who was at that time my guide acro&s;s the country&mdash;Would to heaven that hou&s;e were a public one! Ah, Sir, &s;aid my guide, with a &s;igh, and crack of his whip, it <HI>was</HI> one in former days, that is to &s;ay, it was a hou&s;e for the good of the public, as every body who wanted entertainment, either for man or bea&s;t, was welcome. O, there was rare doings at Newborough-Hall, when my Lord &mdash;, God ble&s;s him, was at home: he is abroad now, and has been (the more is the pity, both for rich and poor) many years; but we expect him back &s;oon, which will make &s;uch a joy in Wales, as has &s;carce been known &s;ince that old moun|tain (meaning Snowden, which is vi&s;ible from the hou&s;e) was no bigger than a mole-hill! You mu&s;t know, Sir, I am William Jones, con|tinued this grateful fellow, I am one of his
<PB N="268" REF="329">Lord&s;hip's tenants&mdash;that little farm on the other &s;ide, is rented by me, where if your honour plea&s;es, I will &s;hew you that I have not lived &s;o many years under &s;o good and gener|ous a ma&s;ter, without benefitting by the ex|ample, and though I cannot &s;et out my table like my Lord Newborough, my old dame, will give you a clean cloth, &s;ome new laid eggs, a curious &s;lice or two of bacon, and as brave a mug of ale, or tankard of cyder, with a da&s;h of brandy, as ever was drawn, and we will drink the health and &s;peedy return of my ma&s;ter, to old Wales.&mdash;God knows, I will drink it&mdash;ju&s;t as I wi&s;h it&mdash;with all my life and &s;oul.</P>
<P>He went on to a&s;&s;ure me that as the day of Lord N&mdash;'s departure from this country, was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, &s;o would his return be the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed to his &s;ervants, tenants, friends, and all de&s;criptions of people&mdash;that for his part he felt it a comfort to get his bread on the ground that belonged to &s;o good a ma&s;ter, and even to walk upon his land, and that he never pa&s;&s;ed by the de&s;erted man&s;ion-hou&s;e, without think|ing of the obligations which he and a thou&s;and others had received from the generous owner.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to ju&s;tify, by in&s;tances of goodne&s;s, this exalted character, in the
<PB N="269" REF="330">cour&s;e of his developing which, he di&s;covered a mo&s;t excellent heart, and not uncultured head, belonging to him&s;elf; but di&s;played &s;o many marks of an enlarged benevolence in his ma&s;ter, that before he had half fini&s;hed his eulogy, my affections warmed towards the noble proprietor of Newborough-Hall, and I could not but join the regrets of hone&s;t Will Jones that he was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>The&s;e little road-adventures, which are &s;o frequently ri&s;ing out of &s;urrounding objects, I mu&s;t once more remark, are among&s;t the riche&s;t gratifications that can happen to a tra|veller of my ta&s;te and temper. They are, in|deed, a &s;ource of almo&s;t daily plea&s;ure, and ex|erci&s;e of the &s;ocial principle: they fre&s;hen, as it were, one's whole heart, and &s;o occupy the be&s;t part of our feelings, that if the roads are bad, and the weather &s;evere, we perceive all ruggedne&s;&s;es and rigours &s;moothe off; and if the way is without difficulty, and the weather fine, and the country, through which we pa&s;s, beautiful, the whole is rendered more delicious by a little regaling ca&s;ualty of this &s;ort. De|cember has not often pre&s;ented a more bitter day than that on which I received a delinea|tion of Lord N&mdash; from William Jones, but &s;ome of the traits, created a kind of &s;ummer
<PB N="270" REF="331">in my bo&s;om, and the re&s;t of the journey to Caernarvon was the happier for it. 'Tis even now &s;weet to remembrance, and is regi&s;tered among&s;t the riches of my &s;heaf.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of <HI>character</HI> in this country; and much of that original wit, humour, and oddity, among&s;t the lower ranks, which the late Henry Fielding &s;o much de|lighted to de&s;cribe. Out of abundance I &s;hall glean only two &s;pecimens, each of which have &s;omething &s;o dramatic, that were I about to write a comedy, I &s;hould be &s;trongly tempted to hitch them into the &s;cene; and as I met with them both in the &s;ame day, their portraits &s;hall be drawn in the &s;ame letter.</P>

<P>Ah, poor David, continued &s;he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, &s;eeing me di&s;po&s;ed to hear, but not to an&s;wer.&mdash;"Ah, poor dear David, he u&s;ed to &s;it, Sir, (<HI>curt&s;ey</HI>) in that very arm|chair, Sir, (<HI>curt&s;ey</HI>) where your honour &s;its now; and though I had to lead him up &s;tairs and down&mdash;put him to bed, and take him up&mdash;poor &s;oul, helple&s;s as an infant&mdash;&s;till

<P>(By way of parenthe&s;is, let me hook in the information that, although I do not continue to in&s;ert the curt&s;eys, it is to be noted, that the good widow went as regularly on with her reverences, as with her &s;tory, and that every da&s;h, you meet with, is &s;ub&s;tituted, to prevent interruption, for a curt&s;ey; the long da&s;h be|ing expre&s;&s;ive of an obei&s;ance nine deep, the &s;hort one, of the little drop, or bob minor.)</P>
<P>"We were notorious for being happy, Sir&mdash; and our hou&s;e, Sir&mdash;though thatched, Sir&mdash; is notorious all over the country, Sir&mdash;and if your honour &s;hould be provoked to &s;tay the night, Sir&mdash;you &s;hall have as good a bed as ever was laid on&mdash;poor David died on it, Sir &mdash;we are notorious for our beds&mdash;me and mine have lived here hundreds of years&mdash; the fine&s;t air in the world&mdash;kill all our own meat&mdash;cut all our own garden &s;tuff&mdash;grow all our own wheat&mdash;make all our own bread&mdash; brew all our own beer.&mdash;In &s;hort, do every thing for our&s;elves, without being beholden to
<PB N="273" REF="334">any body.&mdash;Thus, your honour &s;ees, we are the mo&s;t notorious people on the road." &mdash;</P>
<P>The whole of the foregoing &s;elf-de&s;cription, pa&s;&s;ed without the &s;malle&s;t encouragement or reply; my landlady &s;tanding all the while curt|&s;eying, nodding, crying, and laughing; for I &s;hould have ob&s;erved to you, that at every drop of her knees, &s;he gave a nod of her head, and that whenever &s;he mentioned David's in|firmities, &s;he made up her face and voice into a mo&s;t pity-moving whine, which gave way, however, to a more plea&s;ant twi&s;t of her odd little countenance and tones, when &s;he &s;pake of the notoriou&s;ne&s;s of her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My tea, and her talk ended together, when I told her that I was thoroughly convinced, &s;he had not obtained a notorious character without rea&s;on; but that I found her &s;o enter|taining, that as the evening was too far advan|ced to think of pur&s;uing my journey towards Shrew&s;bury, I would avail my&s;elf of the many good things, for which her hou&s;e is notorious, on condition that &s;he would favour me with as much of her company as po&s;&s;ible, and put me into any bed, but that which poor David had
<PB N="274" REF="335">&s;o lately died upon&mdash;the reflection of which circum&s;tance would prevent my taking any repo&s;e.</P>
<P>I gave it this turn to &s;ave the good widow's feelings, and I ventured to invite her, becau&s;e I imagined her hou&s;e affairs would draw her nods and curt&s;eys to &s;everal other travellers, who now came to pa&s;s the night. Unluckily, however, &s;he re&s;olved to compliment me with her dead David's bed, and though I could have wi&s;hed it put upon a longer quarantine, it was impo&s;&s;ible, for &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, (nod and curt&s;ey as u&s;ual) that not only gentry&mdash;but nobility&mdash;not only '&s;quires&mdash;but barrownights &mdash;not only barrownights&mdash;but lords&mdash; not only lords&mdash;but dukes&mdash; (here a nod that threw her head into her bo&s;om, and a curt&s;ey that almo&s;t over&s;et her)&mdash;and that even the Prince&mdash;of the Principality&mdash;(<HI>nod</HI>)&mdash;(<HI>nod</HI>)&mdash;(<HI>nod</HI>)&mdash; the Prince of Wales him&s;elf&mdash; (<HI>curt&s;ey</HI>)&mdash;(<HI>curt&s;ey</HI>)&mdash;(<HI>curt&s;ey</HI>)&mdash; might lie in that bed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Had the corp&s;e of David been &s;tretched &s;till upon the bed, you &s;ee I mu&s;t have taken part of it; I therefore yielded, and the good widow-woman went nodding and curt&s;eying
<PB N="275" REF="336">through the re&s;t of the evening in perfect good-humour. Her manner mu&s;t lo&s;e much in narration, but I am convinced had it been dramati&s;ed, and &s;haped to the talents of one of our comedians it would have &s;et, at lea&s;t, the galleries, and, perhaps, the whole hou&s;e, in a roar.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, none of her other cu&s;tomers, then in the inn, &s;eemed to be &s;truck with what had &s;o much diverted me: one bid her do more and talk le&s;s&mdash;another &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;he looked on her conver&s;ation as part of the entertainment, and would charge it in the bill&mdash;if &s;o, he mu&s;t decline any more of it. The author of this ob&s;ervation was a wag, who, perhaps, thought he was al&s;o a wit; a third could not help wi&s;hing &s;he had as good talents for &s;ilence, as making a noi&s;e. An hundred others might have entered and departed with|out being a whit more amu&s;ed; but as I am convinced the lover of character would not have pa&s;&s;ed my widow-woman without a note of remark, I cannot but believe you, and your friends will excu&s;e, nay thank me, for making her a little more <HI>notorious.</HI></P>
<P>One man only of the company was wholly &s;ilent, and he had the be&s;t rea&s;on for it;
<PB N="276" REF="337">namely, an intoxication, that wholly deprived him of the powers of &s;peech: two of the others ju&s;t mentioned were his a&s;&s;ociates, who had been to Haverford-We&s;t on foot, to &s;ave as much as po&s;&s;ible of that money, which they had appropriated to the relea&s;e of their friend, the drunken man, who had been two years a pri&s;oner for debt, in the jail of the above|named town, and they were all three natives of Wales, working under the &s;ame ma&s;ter at Shrew&s;bury.</P>
<P>As our widow woman's general &s;itting room u&s;ually &s;erved her like the merry cobler's in the ballad, "for parlour, for kitchen, and hall;" there being no fire-places in the other apart|ments, above, or below; we all were of the &s;ame me&s;s, while we were partaking of which, (the late pri&s;oner excepted, who was as incapable of eating as conver&s;ing) one of the travellers&mdash; he who had his fears that my landlady would make him pay for her eloquence&mdash;thus opened upon me.&mdash;</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, Sir," &s;ays he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me as familiarly as if we had been old acquaintance, "the poor fellow who is now &s;noring in the chimney corner, is Davy Morgan, as hone&s;t a little man as any in
<PB N="277" REF="338">Wales, and put into durance vile, for another man's debt; but we have worked him out, and in a few days we &s;hall be able to &s;hew him to all friends round the wrekin: in the mean|time, poor Davy, is gone tip&s;y with the thought of it: but you mu&s;t not think the wor&s;e of him for that; I hope his getting <HI>into</HI> jail, and <HI>out</HI> of it, once in his life, and being a little <HI>bick&s;ius doxius</HI> upon it, (once in his life, I &s;ay) will not make you think the wor&s;e of him. Come little drunken Davy, here is your health, my boy, as you can't drink, I'll drink for you: any thing to &s;erve a friend &s;leeping or wak|ing; &s;o here's to you in a bumper that holds both our portions, my little &s;leeping Taffy.</P>
<P>This bumper was emptied and filled with &s;uch rapidity, that, if there is any truth in a head full of liquor, the account which was now given by both the comrades at &s;upper, of the &s;noring Davy Morgan, did credit to the hearts of all the three. I gathered, from the torrents of information now poured out, much fa&s;ter than even the ale, that Davy Morgan had been bound for a friend, who&s;e treachery had plunged him not only in a pri&s;on, but in the ruin con&s;equent on the lo&s;s of his time; which u&s;ed to be indu&s;triou&s;ly employed&mdash;that his companions had been in the habits of friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="278" REF="339">labour, and diver&s;ion with him, many years; that by his impri&s;onment, they were deprived at once of their playmate and fellow|workman; and that therefore they had a meet|ing one day, to &s;ee what could be done between them, towards getting their friend out of cu&s;|tody. The re&s;ult of their conference was a ge|nerous, but &s;ecret treaty, to u&s;e every means in their power to obtain his liberty: but the &s;um for which he was confined exceeding abun|dantly their finances, (for they were all but journeymen weavers &s;erving under the &s;ame ma&s;ter) they made an attempt on the mercy of the creditor, in the hope of &s;uch a compro|mi&s;e as they might be able to advance, repre|&s;enting to him, that the misfortune of the pri&s;oner was brought upon him wholly by an act of good-nature, and on the faith of the man who had betrayed him; and that, there|fore, in effect, he was puni&s;hed, not only for the vice of another, but for his own virtue.</P>
<P>This appeal, however, failed; and at a &s;e|cond con&s;ultation, &s;till held without the know|ledge of the captive Davy, they entered into a &s;olemn compact, to put by one-third of their weekly wages, till a &s;um, equal to the poor man's enlargement, &s;hould be accumulated. "We were both brother-bachelors, Sir, &s;aid one
<PB N="279" REF="340">of them, and &s;o could do this without pinch|ing any body but our&s;elves&mdash;Will Griffith there, indeed, was to be married when he could afford a &s;et of linen, a wedding dinner, and a weaving loom, and had got a few good pounds &s;nug in the box, which his intended gave him as a token; but the generous-hearted girl, who is an honour to her country&mdash;"</P>
<P>"She is a Welch girl," Sir, exclaimed Mr. Griffith, "and here's her health with all my &s;oul."</P>
<P>"I &s;ay, Sir," re&s;umed the other traveller, "that this brave wench, on hearing the &s;tory of poor Davy, and the plan to relieve him, in|&s;i&s;ted on her not being the hindrance, but the promoter of his liberty, declaring, that &s;he was ready to contribute an equal &s;hare of her little &s;avings towards effecting that good work, and that, by way of encouragement to her lover, Griffith, &s;he would give him the di&s;|po&s;al of her hand as &s;oon after Davy could at|tend at the wedding, as he thought proper to demand it."</P>
<P>"Till the moment after &s;he &s;aid this, Sir," &s;aid Griffith in rapture, "I did not think it
<PB N="280" REF="341">had been po&s;&s;ible to love her more dearly&mdash; here's another bumper to her."</P>
<P>"To make &s;hort of the &s;tory," continued the other, "to work we went, aye, and worked double tides, for double pay, and Kitty Lewis, who worked too, kept the box. Every Sa|turday night we put in our &s;avings, and count|ed at the end of every quarter. Not a &s;yllable of this to Davy; though we took care in the mean time he &s;hould not want, for while the gra&s;s grows, you know, Sir&mdash;Well, thus we went merrily on&mdash;no matter how long&mdash;till we had enough, then, watching for the Pa&s;&s;ion week, when there is no work done, you know, off we &s;et from Old Salop to Haverford, where poor Davy was taken as he was trying to get over to Ireland, and was &s;hut up. Griffith and I, who were born in the country, knew every inch of the ground; and to &s;ave money for better u&s;es than throwing it away upon hor&s;e|fle&s;h, we footed up after the fa&s;hion of our country, carrying our &s;hoes in one pocket, and &s;tockings in another. When we got to the White Hart, which is a very good inn, directly oppo&s;ite to the pri&s;on, we did not &s;tay to re|fre&s;h, till we had paid a vi&s;it to Morgan. Our hearts were at our lips as we cro&s;&s;ed over the way to him. The poor fellow was &s;ucking in
<PB N="281" REF="342">the fre&s;h air, through the grating, which, be|ing on the ground floor, we could &s;ee and &s;peak to one another. I thought Davy would have leaped through his bars to get at us, though he looked pale as death, and his beard was grown like one of your Hermits. He threw out both his hands, which we took hold of, and told him they were cold as clay: but my heart is as warm and as much your's, as ever, my boys, &s;aid he, in a terrible feeble voice; and if I remain here for the re&s;t of my life, as I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall, I will fall down, night and day, on my dirty &s;traw, to ble&s;s Pro|vidence, that it has &s;ent me the only two men I love in the whole world."</P>
<P>"Don't tell me, Davy, &s;aid Griffith&mdash;you remember Will the&s;e were your words&mdash;don't tell me of &s;taying here the re&s;t of your life&mdash; we do not intend you &s;hall remain here another day; if we can help it, not another hour. We come with a &s;trong box, my little Davy, that &s;hall change your dirty &s;traw into clean feathers, and tho&s;e damn'd ugly looking bars into a warm gla&s;s window; but this is wa&s;ting time&mdash;where's the gaoler&mdash;let us do our bu&s;i|ne&s;s fir&s;t, and talk afterwards."</P>
<P>Hereupon Griffith went in &s;earch of the keeper, and I explained matters to Davy, who
<PB N="282" REF="343">was in a &s;urpri&s;e pa&s;t &s;peaking, only he cried like a child, and &s;ometimes laughed again like a madman, though when he came to him&s;elf, he &s;aid he was a&s;hamed to di&s;tre&s;s us, and &s;uch non&s;en&s;e; to which I only an&s;wered, never mind, when we get our old fellow-workman among&s;t us again, we will &s;oon weave it up, I warrant you: and to tell you the truth, Davy, &s;aid I, we have both had a fore lo&s;s of the &s;ongs you u&s;ed to &s;ing at the loom, and neither of us can do any longer without you.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, Sir, Will Griffiths returned with the gaoler, whom, though he &s;eemed a glum, gruff, growling looking fellow, he had con|trived to make &s;mile, as if he was half as good|humoured a fellow as Will him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Aye, money works miracles, you know, Sir&mdash;exclaimed Will, who thus ended the &s;tory.&mdash;A bribe out of my Kitty's amber-box made the keeper of our poor Davy ha&s;ten to his relea&s;e with almo&s;t as much glee as my|&s;elf; and as &s;oon as the law charges, which were, &s;omehow, as heavy as the, debt, though nothing appeared to be &s;aid or done, but clap|ping the poor fellow in pri&s;on, and leaving him there.&mdash;As &s;oon as the&s;e were fettled, I &s;ay, we took the bird out of his cage, and
<PB N="283" REF="344">carried him in triumph to the White Hart, where we pa&s;&s;ed one of the merrie&s;t evenings of our lives. We have kept it up ever &s;ince: as poor Davy's legs had been of no u&s;e to him for &s;o long a time, they refu&s;ed to do much for him, even now that they were untied, as one may &s;ay, &s;o we got him into the &s;tages as far as they went our way, and when we were obliged to cro&s;s the country, we put him upon a hor&s;e, and at la&s;t, after a jovial jour|ney, here we are at the widow Bowyer's, thank God! within half a dozen miles of Shrew&s;|bury, and Kitty Lewis. That being the ca&s;e, we will, if you plea&s;e, Sir, have one more bottle to the health and happine&s;s of all par|ties: the amber-box holds out &s;till, and here it is, at the &s;ervice of any hone&s;t fellow that wants it, though we never &s;aw him before in our lives, and &s;hould never &s;ee him again. As to Kitty, if &s;he takes me without a &s;hilling, &s;he takes me for my&s;elf: unle&s;s we are both &s;ick at the &s;ame time, we can never be in need of bread, becau&s;e the hands of either can earn it; and as to loom and linen, they may be waited for, and what the wedding dinner may want in fineries, it &s;hall make up in good plain fare, and good appetite."</P>
<P>Will Griffiths having fini&s;hed his &s;peech, ki&s;&s;ed the amber-box with great devotion,
<PB N="284" REF="345">&s;wore it &s;hould not be long ere his labours filled it again, and then &s;hook me heartily by the hand, ob&s;erving, that he could fee I liked the hi&s;tory he had been recounting, as it had made me &s;hed tears more than once in the telling; and whenever I am touched to the heart with any thing, &s;aid he, I always cry.</P>
<P>Davy Morgan waked, and was all the better for his nap. His comrades greeted his return to life, as one of them called it, with three cheers, three bumpers of the notorious widow's ale, and three &s;uch flaps on the back, that he mu&s;t have been actually dead not to have &s;hook off all remains of &s;lumber. And now he had one advantage over his friends, who had &s;acrificed to Liberty in &s;o many "pota|tions pottle deep, "that they literally fell mar|tyrs, on the floor, to their, affections, and the excellent home-brew'd of the widow, who ex|hibited, in the cour&s;e of the tale, many in|&s;tances of a good heart, by dropping a very low curt&s;ey at every mark of the generality of the young weavers, giving them a grateful nod at the &s;ame rime; and declaring, that if the widow's mite would be accepted by Davy Morgan, the amber-box &s;hould not be for|gotten.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="346">I really regret that Davy's plea&s;ant compeers were now rendered &s;o incapable, as to re|quire the &s;upports of the good widow, my own, and even tho&s;e of Davy him&s;elf to con|duct them to bed. Davy, on his part, was quite renewed; and, under&s;tanding from Mrs. Bowyer, that I had heard his &s;tory, &s;oon ju&s;ti|&s;ied his departed friends' eulogium, of being a very plea&s;ant, grateful, and good-humoured, as well as ingenious fellows.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, the widow reminding us it was midnight, I intreated to drink a gla&s;s of good wi&s;hes to the company, as well &s;leeping as awake, and then promi&s;ed to retire. One more tankard was therefore drawn; but it was &s;o reli&s;hing to Davy, that he took it nearly off at a draught, not only from love of the liquor, but of his friends. A &s;econd tankard was therefore brought, but unluckily the hearty vi&s;it paid to the other, came too &s;uddenly on Davy's recovery from the former libations, and his &s;ober &s;en&s;es began to relap&s;e. The wi|dow began to wink in her wicker chair&mdash;that line you may think has called in&mdash;
<Q>"apt alliteration's artful aid;"</Q>
but, I a&s;&s;ure you, it was accidental&mdash;the wi|dow fell a&s;leep&mdash;Davy held the tankard in his
<PB N="286" REF="347">hand; and without attending to a third or fourth per&s;on being in the room&mdash;probably without knowing there was any body but him|&s;elf pre&s;ent, indulged, and di&s;played him&s;elf in a &s;oliloquy, which, if you will plea&s;e to advert to time, place, and foregone circum&s;tances, may divert you. I &s;top you from it only while I a&s;&s;ert that
<Q><L>"I &s;hall nought extenuate,</L>
<L>"Nor &s;et down ought in frolic."</L></Q>
A whole year's conver&s;ation could not, to my mind, better have pourtrayed the man.</P>
<P>Now, Davy Morgan, is the time to &s;hew thy&s;elf a great fool, or a &s;en&s;ible little fellow. Twice to-day haft thou been out of thy wits for joy, and art but ju&s;t come into them again enough to be &s;orry for it. Beware the third time. The ale is certainly good&mdash;there's no denying it&mdash;(Here he lifted the tankard almo&s;t to his lips) I could drink every drop of it with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure.&mdash;It is but lifting the tankard half an inch higher, opening my mouth a little wider&mdash;in this manner&mdash;and if would be gone pa&s;t recovery, as King or Prince Denmark &s;ays&mdash;
<Q><L>"To drink, or not to drink?&mdash;that is the que&s;tion;</L>
<L>"Whether 'tis better for thee, Davy, thus to &s;uffer</L>
<L>"The flings and arrows of outrageous thir&s;t,</L>
<L>"Or by thus plunging in a &s;ea of ale,</L>
<L>"Tippling, to end it?&mdash;to drink! and &s;leep</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="348">"No more; and by that &s;leep to end</L>
<L>"The head-ache, and the thou&s;and natural &s;hocks</L>
<L>"That tippling's heir to&mdash;'tis a con&s;ummation</L>
<L>"Devoutly to be wi&s;h'd&mdash;to drink and &s;leep&mdash;</L>
<L>"Perchance be drunk again!&mdash;ah there's the rub!"</L></Q>
No, damn it, Davy, don't make a bea&s;t of thy&s;elf any more to-day, there's a good little fellow. Thou art at pre&s;ent merry and wife. Keep &s;o, my lad, for the honour of Wales, and for the &s;ake of the good fortune that has dragged thee out of thy hole, into the land of freedom&mdash;Down, tempter, down."</P>
<P>Here he lowered the tankard, but with &s;uch ha&s;te, that he &s;pilt part of its contents on his chin, the &s;weet and &s;avory &s;mell of which &s;o quickened appetite, as Milton &s;aid of Eve, when the grand tempter pre&s;ented the forbid|den fruit, that poor Davy Morgan felt the original &s;in was entailed on him. He again held the tankard up to his lips, and could not but ta&s;te. In that perilous in&s;tant he ex|claimed&mdash;Davy, why don't you pull it away with all your might&mdash;(here he began to &s;ip) why don't you &s;ay&mdash;Satan in the &s;hape of a tankard of beer, avaunt&mdash;(here he &s;poke with his head in the mug) why don't you da&s;h it to the ground&mdash;have you no honour&mdash;no re|&s;olution&mdash;no philo&s;ophy&mdash;no con&s;ideration&mdash; no gratitude ?

<P>At this moment, a lamentable cry was heard at the door, accompanied by a loud rapping. On opening it, a poor creature appeared half|fami&s;hed with cold: it was the po&s;t-boy, be|twixt Pool and Shrew&s;bury, who, being &s;eized with the cramp in his &s;tomach, came to get a dram. He had &s;carce time to de&s;cribe the nature of his complaint, before Davy Morgan applied a remedy, by thru&s;ting the poker, which happened to be red-hot, into the tan|kard; and then pouring the ale, thus heated, down the &s;hivering man's throat&mdash;execrating him&s;elf, all the time, as a prodigal who had been wantonly wafting that which might now have been &s;o much better di&s;po&s;ed of.&mdash;See, you ra&s;cal, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, what comes of your guggling&mdash;you de&s;erve to be lent back again to pri&s;on you do.&mdash;</P>
<P>The poor po&s;t-boy &s;oon felt him&s;elf reno|vated, for the widow added a gill of her noto|rious brandy to Davy's burned ale, after which he again mounted his hor&s;e, &s;aying he &s;hould &s;oon fetch up lo&s;t time, and honed God would
<PB N="289" REF="350">always ble&s;s tho&s;e who he &s;wore had &s;aved his life.</P>
<P>Davy Morgan, however, kept abu&s;ing him|&s;elf for &s;ome time after, but I contrived to pa|cify him by a&s;&s;uring him, if he could parody Hamlet's celebrated &s;peech &s;o plea&s;antly, I &s;hould think he de&s;erved to get tip&s;y as often as he cho&s;e, though it were to be with Nectar or Tokay. Begging, therefore, he would for|give him&s;elf this time, we all went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The morning brought us all once more to|gether; and our breakfa&s;t, for I was now one of the party, was a very &s;ober one. In the middle of it there happened an incident, which &s;o accumulated the intere&s;ts of the little drama, that it added another notoriety to the hou&s;e of the courteous widow. This was the entrance of a very hand&s;ome young woman, in a blue riding habit, and &s;traw bonnet, bound tight with a pea-green ribbon, which was fa&s;tened gyp&s;ey fa&s;hion; and di&s;played &s;uch parts of a pretty countenance, as made the &s;pectator de&s;irous to fee the whole. Such a blu&s;h as has a thou&s;and rimes ten thou&s;and been &s;een, and felt, by lovers, but never ju&s;tly de&s;cribed, even by them, for who can paint like Nature? One of the&s;e inde&s;cribable graces of that
<Q><PB N="290" REF="351">
<L>"Eloquent blood,</L>
<L>"Which &s;o di&s;tinctly wrought,</L>
<L>"That you might almo&s;t &s;ay her body thought;"</L></Q> &s;uffu&s;ed it&s;elf over her fine, and by no means inelegant, countenance, at the fight of the man of her heart, &s;eated at table with the cho&s;en friend, towards who&s;e ran&s;om from captivity, &s;he had her&s;elf &s;o generou&s;ly contributed. This young per&s;on was in the &s;ervice of an old lady of fortune, who was blind; a misfortune which this attendant, who, you perceive, was no other than Kitty Lewis, greatly mitigated; for being her&s;elf the daughter of a Mont|gomery&s;hire farmer of &s;ome credit, and a girl of no mean talents; be&s;ides the culture of a good education, &s;he was well calculated to entertain tho&s;e, who could not entertain them&s;elves, and was, therefore, very ju&s;tly con&s;idered by her lady, rather as a friend than &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The moment that Davy Morgan's enlarge|ment was effected, Will Griffith wrote her word of it, and mentioned the time at which he &s;hould regain Shrew&s;bury: but accidents on the road detaining him, Kitty, then for the fir&s;t time, made her Lady confidential. She declined doing &s;o till the object of her lover's journey was attained, willing that the honour of it &s;hould not be &s;hared with any but the trio
<PB N="291" REF="352">that projected it. The old lady, however, was, as Kitty afterwards told me, touched even to tears; nor did &s;he &s;uffer tho&s;e dews of pity to melt away, or dry up without effect.</P>
<P>Kitty had heard from the Pool po&s;t-boy, with whom &s;he was acquainted, that his life had been lo&s;t, but for the humanity of a merry gen|tleman, who&s;e name, he under&s;tood, was David Morgan, then at the widow Bowyer's, from which information, &s;he drew the natural in|ference that her lover had got &s;o far on his journey with his generous companion and li|berated friend; but that &s;topping &s;o near the place of their de&s;tination might proceed from &s;ome little difficulty, that money might re|move. This latter idea was &s;ugge&s;ted by the good old Lady, who was now in the &s;ecret of the amber travelling box, and who in&s;i&s;ted that Kitty &s;hould be her&s;elf the bearer of a re|enforcement; but take care to pre&s;ent her bounty-money in a way that &s;hould not &s;poil the plot, by an appearance of a fourth per&s;on's coming into it, de&s;iring, at the &s;ame time, that the party might, immediately, on their arrival at Shrew&s;bury, repair to her hou&s;e; and that the adventure &s;hould not want a fini&s;h, &s;he permitted Kitty to make the excur&s;ion in a po&s;t chai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="353">Kitty was now &s;eated by her lover's fide; but was far too happy with her errand, and with the view of the objects of it, to partake of our breakfa&s;t; neither did Will Griffith &s;eem to take any food, but that which love and friend&s;hip provided for his hone&s;t and affec|tionate heart. The bill was &s;oon demanded by Kitty Lewis, when the widow declared it was paid. "It is paid," quoth the good wo|man, "by the merrie&s;t night, and happie&s;t morning, I have ever had.&mdash;I will take no money.&mdash;Ye&s;terday and to-day &s;hall be noto|rious. What you have had, you are welcome to&mdash;and a thou&s;and thanks&mdash;into&mdash;the bargain.&mdash;(The&s;e thou&s;and thanks were ex|pre&s;&s;ed by almo&s;t as many nods and curt&s;eys.) You need not take out your amber box, Mr. Griffith&mdash;nor you your pur&s;e, Mi&s;s Kitty&mdash; what's jour name&mdash;I am notorious for telling the truth, and what I &s;ay, I &s;ay&mdash;&s;o God be with you&mdash;(<HI>nod and curt&s;ey</HI>)&mdash;and &s;end you health and wealth, and grace to do well&mdash;and pray none of you pa&s;s the King's Head, with|out calling&mdash;I can do a good turn, as well as another&mdash;&s;ervant&mdash;your &s;ervant&mdash;fare ye well&mdash;good bye&mdash;I wi&s;h ye all a good day&mdash; and a plea&s;ant ride to Shrew&s;bury&mdash;and next market-day, mayhap, you may &s;ee me&mdash;."</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="354">During this &s;peech &s;he was nodding and curt&s;eying off the company&mdash;helping them to hats, &s;ticks, packages, and hurrying them out of her hou&s;e, to prevent them in&s;i&s;ting on the payment of the bill, which Kitty fettled in another room, whither &s;he and the generous widow went to confer. The young woman was diffident about entering the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and Davy Morgan, who had cried for joy, almo&s;t the whole time of breakfa&s;t, was appre|hen&s;ive that the proud Salopians would laugh him to &s;corn, to go from a jail into a carriage; but Kitty gave it as her opinion, that their re|fu&s;al to profit by her Lady's goodne&s;s would be an affront never to be forgiven; ob&s;erving, that as to the &s;corners, <HI>they</HI> mu&s;t have little claim to attention, who did not feel that an hone&s;t man, who had been put into pri&s;on for &s;acri|firing him&s;elf to his friend, was not entitled to go home in the mod honourable manner; and that, for her part, &s;he thought &s;uch a man had better claim to a triumphal entry than Julius Cae&s;ar, Alexander the Great, or any other illu&s;trious butcher of antiquity; in as far, as a friend to mankind is more de&s;erving of honourable di&s;tinctions than an enemy.</P>
<P>This adju&s;ted the difficulty, and after &s;haking hands, all round, the four friends &s;et off for
<PB N="294" REF="355">Shrew&s;bury, where they patted the day in high fe&s;tivity, under the au&s;pices of the good old Lady, who declared, that although Providence had denied her the plea&s;ure of beholding &s;uch happine&s;s, it had not taken away the power of feeling it to the bottom of her heart.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed no longer after them than while I congratulated my&s;elf, and the courteous wi|dow, on the little adventure which had pa&s;&s;ed at her inn, which I a&s;&s;ured her would render it notorious to me for ever; and that I would make the circuit of Wales, in much harder weather than it then was, to obtain &s;uch ano|ther night and morning. You, who are &s;o ver&s;ed in the nooks, corners, and bye-places of my character, will not doubt my u&s;ing a direction I had obtained from the young weavers to pay them my re&s;pects at home. I found them all a&s;&s;embled at the hou&s;e of Will Griffith, who told me with rapture, too great to help it overflowing at his eyes, that Kitty's Lady had in&s;i&s;ted on his not waiting for the happy day, while his labour &s;hould regain a &s;um, equal to what his friendship had &s;o pro|perly di&s;po&s;ed; but that &s;he would her&s;elf ad|vance &s;ufficient to make them happy imme|diately, on condition that Kitty was to con|tinue her &s;ituation, and Will him&s;elf to ac|cept
<PB N="295" REF="356">an apartment in her hou&s;e; declaring, that &s;o many years attention to a poor, old, blind woman, who could not even move from one room to another, without the aid of that wor|thy girl, demanded alt the kindne&s;s &s;he could &s;hew her; ob&s;erving, moreover, that Griffith had, in his late journey, &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o de&s;erv|ing of her, that &s;he was re&s;olved on the &s;atis|faction of knowing they were united before &s;he died; and that &s;he was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the means of bringing them together.</P>
<P>Fortunately, my dear friend, my engage|ments made me re&s;identiary in Shrew&s;bury, a &s;ufficient time to witne&s;s this plea&s;ant event; but, I truly believe, that had no other point detained me, that one would not have &s;uffered me to depart, till I had atte&s;ted the felicity of William and Kitty.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, neverthele&s;s, be confe&s;&s;ed, that were I in the&s;e Gleanings, addre&s;&s;ing only that part of your di&s;po&s;ition, which fits you to "&s;hine in courts," and grace a drawing-room, it would have been &s;inning, pa&s;t forgivene&s;s, to carry you into a common ale-hou&s;e, and in|&s;tead of leaving it after a little refre&s;hment, detaining you there all night, in low company: but when I look on my&s;elf, as making an
<PB N="296" REF="357">appeal to that, part of your character, which bids your beating heart exult in the happine&s;s of your humble&s;t fellow-creatures: among&s;t whom is often found, by tho&s;e who are not too lofty minded to look for them, in lowly dwell|ings, tho&s;e feelings of which the mo&s;t noble born might be proud. I have no &s;upercilious taunt to fear, but the mo&s;t ingenuous thanks to expect, for thus flopping, by the way, when|ever an hone&s;t heart is to be pourtrayed, whe|ther it is the property of a prince or pea&s;ant. Certain I am, that your affections have long &s;ince dropt your tributary guinea into the amber box, with a prayer that it may never be empty; that the notorious, widow has, in your grateful fancy, received your nods of re|&s;pon&s;e and approbation; that poor Davy Mor|gan's tankard has been twice filled with good wi&s;hes, for the comforting draught he gave the half-peri&s;hed po&s;t-boy; that Will Griffith, and his friend have received your homage, for their adventure at the grate of Davy's pri&s;on; that even the blind old Lady has had your ble&s;&s;ing; and that the young couple will be long remembered by your &s;ympathi&s;ing heart. Adventures like the&s;e, my friend, are unim|portant only to tho&s;e magnificent triflers, who think they are wife, when they are only vain; and as much of human comfort proceeds from
<PB N="297" REF="358">humble circum&s;tances, we may ju&s;tly conclude with the poet, in tho&s;e enchanting lines I have &s;o often read to you; and which are the more appreciated, ina&s;much as I loved the author, heard them recited by his own lips, a very few weeks before I lo&s;t him for ever, and know how truly he felt, what, with &s;uch exqui&s;ite beauty, he has de&s;cribed: for Gold&s;mith was one of the very few poets of nature, who wrote only from his fen&s;ations, and did not &s;acrifice the plain hone&s;ty of genuine feelings to decorate his rhimes.</P>

<P>With what energy and enthu&s;ia&s;m did the bard, though by no means a graceful reader, repeat the four la&s;t ver&s;es; and on the evening I heard them delivered, he threw down the ma|nu&s;cript on his writing table, in his abrupt way, &s;aying, "in troth, this is all as true as if it was in pro&s;e," and as I have &s;aid before, and &s;hall continue to &s;ay to the end of my life&mdash;

<HEAD>LETTER XX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>YOU thank me for my poetry, with|out being aware into what a &s;crape your ac|knowledgments have led you. The grant of one reque&s;t paves the way for fre&s;h application, I have a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire to &s;end you more ef|fu&s;ions of the mu&s;e; and &s;o far from being of the general opinion, that a little of ver&s;e &s;hould be relieved by a great deal of pro&s;e, I think the mind is never &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to receive poetic impre&s;&s;ion, or rather, to feel impre&s;&s;ion conti|nued, as when it has been touched and warmed already by the &s;ubjects worthy of the lyre: or, if the emotion already excited &s;hould be found too &s;olemn, the gayer mu&s;e may be permitted to &s;tep in and &s;often, but not de&s;troy, the pathos. For the&s;e rea&s;ons I have cho&s;en this letter for the in&s;ertion of &s;ome &s;pontaneous lines, which have not yet met your eyes, or tho&s;e of the public. You have long &s;ince, I tru&s;t, agreed to accept my corre&s;pondence as a literary ca|binet, in which I am permitted to place, for

What I have now to give, in|deed, is, I confe&s;s, not a little out of time, as you may one day know, but has the advantage of being perfectly in place; for it happened in this very country, in this very town, that I felt the emotions de&s;cribed in the following &s;tanzas. You will con&s;ider me in one of my &s;oliloquy perambulations by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and my mind &s;trongly fa&s;tened on by many of tho&s;e bitter reflections which baffled, at intervals, all the powers I invoked to di&s;pel them.

<P>Ah, my friend! may none of the incidents, to which &s;en&s;ibility is heir, tempt <HI>your</HI> firm mind, beyond its &s;trength, even for a moment; but, if it &s;hould, (as our &s;ouls, no le&s;s than our bodies, are very "fearfully and wonder|fully made,") may the &s;acred order, mention|ed in the concluding &s;tanza of the&s;e &s;ea-&s;ide ver&s;es, impre&s;s <HI>you</HI> al&s;o with an awful &s;en&s;e of their being among&s;t the words &s;poken by
<PB N="304" REF="365">GOD, and give you energies to bear the mi&s;e|ries of life.&mdash;I cannot but take notice of the u&s;e of tho&s;e great truths, which it is the part of education to engrave on our memories, while that regi&s;ter is mo&s;t favorable to im|pre&s;&s;ion. The moral &s;entiments which we re|ceive in childhood "grow with our growth and &s;trength:" they are &s;o many le&s;&s;ons for the government of the heart in which they are fixed; every precept, we are taught to trea|&s;ure up in our memories, in the <HI>earlie&s;t</HI> pe|riods of our lives, comes by degrees into prac|tice, and &s;erves not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t us to &s;ubdue vice, but to animate virtue, till &s;he feels <HI>proud of</HI> her difficulties. And hence, I am &s;eriou&s;ly led to believe, that we derive more real good, real virtue, and real wi&s;dom, from that little &s;y&s;tem of morals, which we gather from the fir&s;t books that are put into our hands (after we lay a&s;ide our horn-books and primers) than from all our elaborate &s;tudies afterwards; and I am per&s;uaded more true heroes, &s;tate&s;|men, and which is far better than either, ho|ne&s;t men, have been formed by Ae&s;op, Phaedrus, Gay, and Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, and by the hi&s;|tories which take only half a day in reading, than were ever modelled by tho&s;e hi&s;tories which demand the &s;tudy of half a life; and it has long been a doubt with me, whether
<PB N="305" REF="366">Jack the Giant Killer has not made more cou|rageous officers, and better generals, (I am &s;ure he has le&s;s mi&s;chievous ones) than Julius Cae&s;ar, or Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I confe&s;s, I am indebted to the poets, who&s;e maxims were imprinted on my in&s;ant mind, for the heightening of every joy, and meliorating every &s;orrow, that has befallen me &s;ince; and I particularly remember, that &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe tended more effectually to &s;ettle my mind to the di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence, on the evening of the day in which I wrote the ver&s;es that ac|company this letter, than, perhaps, it would have been in the power of Seneca, Socrates, or any of the mo&s;t renowned philo&s;ophers, of an|cient or modern days, to afford me.</P>
<P>In fine, my friend&mdash;if we expect plea&s;ure, we mu&s;t make up our minds to pain. They are twins, and Dr. Young is right:
<Q><L>"Complain of grie&s;! complain thou art a man!</L>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may have perceived, my dear friend, that &s;ince I have been taking you out of Wales, we have been gradually taking leave al&s;o of our ob&s;ervations on that principality: in &s;hort, I do not remember any other points which are <HI>gleanable.</HI> With re&s;pect to the an|cient and modern hi&s;tory of the country, it is well known to you: hi&s;tories, indeed, of every country, are &s;o numerous, that a reader is puzzled to make his election. But the fault to be found with almo&s;t all biographical wri|tings, is not more their number than their bulk, which is, for the mo&s;t part, produced by extraneous matter, not more nece&s;&s;ary to the body politic, than an excre&s;cence to the body natural. Hi&s;torians indulge them&s;elves in the&s;e &s;uperfluities from various motives; among&s;t which national prejudice, and the de|fire, the nece&s;&s;ity, or the pride, of becoming, at once, a great folio or quarto author, are not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="368">I have often thought that all the hi&s;tories now extant, with re&s;pect to the facts really nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the productions of art, or nature, or the progre&s;&s;ive ri&s;e and fall of &s;tates, or their &s;udden revolutions, might be com|pre&s;&s;ed, without being crouded into, at mo&s;t, the number of volumes allotted to the hi&s;tory of any particular country, according to the modern fa&s;hion of writing.</P>
<P>By way of example, let us take that of Eng|land. Would it not be better to give the facts in the &s;tronge&s;t and &s;horte&s;t way: offer the inferences in the &s;ame &s;tyle, and leave the re|flections in a great mea&s;ure to the reader? It would at lea&s;t be a decent compliment to his under&s;tanding; and &s;ave him money. If, in|deed, it could be proved, that the reflections made by the hi&s;torian, Mr. A. were deci&s;ive, and would &s;ettle the reader's mind on the &s;ub|ject, it would be mighty well; but unluckily the hi&s;torian, Mr. B. comes upon you with &s;even or eight more volumes of reflections, in which he flatly contradicts the hi&s;torian, Mr. A. and throws the reader in a &s;trait betwixt two. Now, as no man tumbles into a diffi|culty, without accepting any help that is of|fered him to get out of it, the poor reader
<PB N="308" REF="369">&s;eeks the aid of the hi&s;torian, Mr. C. who re|futes the rea&s;oning of the other two with &s;o much good writing, that after the like quantity of good reading, the &s;tudent wi&s;hes to fix his faith on this middle man, in the hope of going &s;afe and &s;ure between the two other extremes.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, however, &s;ome judicious friend or other recommends to him, as a better guide than either of the three, that admirable hi&s;torian, Mr. D. who, with great force of language, gives the lie direct to all that went before him, and either awes or frightens his readers into a belief of him only. And here perhaps he might fix his biographical creed, but that another friend puts into his hand the excellent work of the hi&s;torian, Mr. E. in whom the &s;pirit of contradiction is no le&s;s ful|minating again&s;t the other betrayers of the truth. By the greate&s;t good fortune, however, he meets in the hi&s;torian, Mr. F. a &s;trict conformity of opinion with Me&s;&s;rs. A. and B. di&s;&s;enting only in a few points. He very na|turally wi&s;hes, therefore, to come to a &s;ort of compromi&s;e with the&s;e three hi&s;torians, by dividing his faith between them: but, alas! while he is making up his mind to this, he is told of a production &s;uperior to all that ever
<PB N="309" REF="370">went before, or &s;hall come after&mdash;even the work of that delectable hi&s;torian, Mr. G. an author, he is a&s;&s;ured, who carries the energies of conviction in every page, and who does not merely di&s;tance his competitors in the biographical career, but is to keep them out of the reader's &s;ight for ever. He &s;ets "doggedly down," as John&s;on calls it, to this grand un|dertaking, and reads it with an eagerne&s;s pro|portioned to his expectation of being made ea&s;y for life, on the article of his hi&s;torical faith: he is fa&s;cinated with the &s;tyle, the characters, and the picture&s;que embelli&s;hments, and with a winter's hard reading, gets to the end of the book; but by no means, to the end of his labours; for, in the cour&s;e of the performance, he finds &s;o many rea&s;ons to di&s;believe what he before credited, and to credit what others taught him to di&s;believe, that confu&s;ion is con|founded, and Chaos is, indeed, come again. What &s;hall he do next? Much &s;tudy, and many many authors have made him almo&s;t mad.</P>
<P>But in this di&s;tracted &s;tate he finds relief, only, in trying to eject the ma&s;s of contrary opinions from his head, and to try that &s;cience, no le&s;s hard in literature than in love, to <HI>forget.</HI>
<PB N="310" REF="371">He is reduced to the ridiculous nece&s;&s;ity of making a <HI>memorandum not to remember!</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps, he now gives him&s;elf a &s;ummer's rece&s;s from reading hi&s;tories; but is taken by &s;urpri&s;e in the winter; to enrich which there is put forth in weekly numbers &s;o compleat a hi&s;tory, on an entire new plan, and by a &s;o|ciety of gentlemen, among&s;t whom are tho&s;e well-known hi&s;torians, Me&s;&s;rs. H. I. J. K. L. M. N. O. and &s;everal other illu&s;trious per&s;onages of the Alphabet, that as it is to be paid for imperceptibly, and to an&s;wer the great end of fixing his hi&s;torical belief on an immoveable ba&s;is, he mu&s;t needs become both purcha&s;er and reader. Among&s;t &s;o many coun|&s;ellors it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed there mu&s;t be wi&s;|dom, e&s;pecially as mo&s;t of them are marked out to the public by &s;ome honorary di&s;tinctions; &s;uch as A. M. D. D. LL. D. F. R. S. &amp;c. &amp;c. But before the numbers are half completed, he makes a di&s;covery not a little mortifying to a man who has been at &s;uch pains to get at the truth; namely, that this very gentlemanly a&s;&s;o|ciation are airy nothings, to whom the pub|li&s;her has given a local habitation, and a name to give plau&s;ibility to a catchpenny performance.
<PB N="311" REF="372">And now for the fir&s;t time he makes an ap|proach towards comfort, by feeling his indig|nation excited again&s;t the fabricators of the&s;e &s;plendid nonentities.</P>
<P>At length, having tried all the hi&s;torians from great <HI>A,</HI> to <HI>amper&s;and,</HI> he perceives there is no e&s;caping from the puzzle, but by &s;electing his own facts, forming his own conclu&s;ions, and putting a little tru&s;t in his own rea&s;on and judgment.</P>
<P>For all which con&s;iderations, I &s;hall not pre|tend to point out to you another Hi&s;tory of England and Wales. I &s;hall &s;imply ob&s;erve, that old Carodoc's book, ob&s;olete as now it may be thought, &s;eems to me to have been the grand &s;ource from whence all &s;ucceeding biographers have drawn their mo&s;t u&s;eful in|formation.
<Q>"Truth they &s;ay lies in a well."</Q></P>
<P>Into this hi&s;torical well of Carodoc, authors have let down their empty buckets, for more than a century, and drawn them up full, but though they have drank largely, they have
<PB N="312" REF="373">&s;eldom had the gratitude, or hone&s;ty to confe&s;s to whom they were indebted.</P>
<P>Thus, my valuable friend, we have travelled together, irregularly, indeed, and without any &s;ettled directions, but, I tru&s;t, not un|plea&s;antly; nor wholly unprofitably; and for a con&s;iderable time, over one of the mo&s;t de|lightful countries in the univer&s;e. In our little pour, we have been diligent to add a &s;heaf to the copious harve&s;t already carried home, to the great &s;torehou&s;e of the Briti&s;h empire, who ought to be proud of the bright and beautiful appendage, which we have been <HI>gleaning.</HI> We have picked up &s;omething for the head, and for the heart.
<Q>"Try'd what the open, what the covert yields."</Q> and, I tru&s;t, you would join my regrets in bid|ding Cambria adieu, did you not al&s;o join me in the hope that we &s;hall one day &s;ee the ori|ginal of the picture, who&s;e principal features I have copied, and &s;ee it together. Meantime, I cannot better take my leave of it than by con|firming with the mo&s;t grateful &s;atisfaction the following ju&s;t and &s;ummary account, that the Welch are very ho&s;pitable, and the people in general, very obliging to &s;trangers; that they
<PB N="313" REF="374">are willing to tell every thing that belongs to their country, ready to &s;hew all that is worth &s;eeing, and to give you hearty invitations to refre&s;h you by the way. In a word, they re|ceive you well in their hou&s;es, treat you very hand&s;omely, and leave you nothing to de&s;ire while you are their gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Farewell then to this gentle country, and &mdash;farewell to you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE effect of contra&s;t is univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed, and its power could not be well called forth, more impre&s;&s;ively on the eye, the heart, and the imagination, than by a rapid tran&s;ition, from the beautiful mountains of North and South Wales, to the everla&s;ting flats of Holland; from the exqui&s;ite wood|lands and vallies of Brecknock, and the &s;ub|limities of Snowden and Plinlimmon to the uniform levels of land and water, which &s;o ju&s;tly entitle the greater part of the terri|tory of the Dutch to the epithet amphibi|ous. I write to you amid&s;t pro&s;pects and places &s;o very different from tho&s;e I have re|cently left and de&s;cribed, that it almo&s;t &s;eems as if I was addre&s;&s;ing you from a new world. The pau&s;e, however, which has been allowed to my communications, (more than &s;ix months having elap&s;ed &s;ince I la&s;t wrote) will evince that I do not pre&s;ume to give you new pictures of new people and new places, till I have given time to fini&s;h the drawings, and pre&s;ent them to you tolerable likene&s;&s;es. In a word,
<PB N="315" REF="376">the &s;top that has happened in our corre|&s;pondence, may &s;erve to &s;hew, that I hold my purpo&s;e of continuing to be a re&s;identiary tra|veller here, as well as el&s;ewhere, and that I de&s;ign to glean the Continent in the &s;ame di|ligent and deliberate way, that I have gleaned particular parts of our beautiful i&s;land.</P>
<P>A French touri&s;t gives his readers the fol|lowing curious rea&s;on for not making any re|marks upon Holland. "I can give you," &s;ays he, "very little that is new re&s;pecting a coun|try, which, in truth, has no re&s;emblance to any other; but of which a &s;ufficient knowledge may be gained, without having &s;een it at all, for the little in&s;truction it can &s;upply."</P>
<P>Now this very circum&s;tance, of a country re&s;embling no other, is the mo&s;t convincing one that could be given, that it mu&s;t afford the greate&s;t novelty of ob&s;ervation; and &s;o far from a truth is it, that he who has not &s;een, or read of it, can have a competent idea of it, that I do not believe there is a country in the whole world that is le&s;s to be gue&s;&s;ed at, or that is more fertile of curious, amu&s;ing, or in&s;tructive remarks. Much has certainly been &s;aid of it, much remains to be &s;aid. It
<PB N="316" REF="377">has yielded plentiful crops, but it will &s;till yield no &s;canty gleanings. Remember this is &s;aid on the experience of half a year's re&s;idence in the Republic, before I even begin to write down what I have &s;een, felt, or under&s;tood: and during this &s;pace of time I have examined what others a&s;&s;ert with no le&s;s zeal than indu&s;|try, and with exactly the view that led me to in&s;pect all the publications re&s;pecting Wales, namely, to render my own the better, the wi&s;er, and the more entertaining by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whenever it could be called in to &s;trengthen, enrich, or illu&s;trate&mdash;a view which will guide and govern me to the end of my journeyings, even though I &s;hould pur&s;ue them to the end of the earth.</P>
<P>The ancient hi&s;tory of this country is liable to the complaint I brought again&s;t that of Eng|land, being &s;welled from octavos to quartos, from quartos to folios, and running from five volumes to five and twenty per work. Being firmly per&s;uaded, that the e&s;&s;ence of all this may be con&s;olidated in at <HI>mo&s;t</HI> five and twenty pages, I tru&s;t you will accept of what follows on the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this &s;ingular coun|try, and its original inhabitants. It will, at lea&s;t, &s;ave you a great deal of unprofitable
<PB N="317" REF="378">reading, and give you in a &s;ingle morning, or evening, as much information, as I have been able to collect from a month's &s;tudy. Nor will it, I tru&s;t, prove unamu&s;ing to one who attends &s;o much as you do to the infancy of men and things.</P>
<P>About a century, then, before the common aera, the Cimbrians and Tutons &s;uddenly expa|triated them&s;elves from the Cher&s;one&s;us, now known by the names of Jutland, and the i&s;les of Conan, at pre&s;ent denominated Denmark. A violent and unexpected inundation, as it is &s;aid, but more probably too exce&s;&s;ive a popula|tion for their native country to &s;upport, or per|haps, an ambition to e&s;tabli&s;h in another, in|duced this &s;ingular emigration. Be that as it may, men, women, and children, of all ages and de&s;criptions, bid an everla&s;ting adieu to the places of their birth; and, like a torrent over|flowing its banks, they carried away with them almo&s;t every thing, and every body in their path; for divers other nations incited by their example, and, perhaps, in&s;tigated al&s;o by &s;imi|lar motives, joined them on the way, and &s;peedily a&s;&s;ociating, entered into the &s;pirit of this romantic expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="379">Among&s;t the per&s;ons whom the&s;e rovers met with in their pa&s;&s;age, were the ance&s;tors of the people, in who&s;e country I have now begun to make my hi&s;torical Gleanings.</P>
<P>The old Batavians were the more ready to enter them&s;elves volunteers in this adventure, as their own country, ever more or le&s;s at the mercy of the mighty waters, was, at that par|ticular moment, invaded by an influx of the German ocean, which threatened not only their goods and habitations, but their lives. The Roman hi&s;tory &s;hews us the ravages which the&s;e wandering multitudes committed in Spain and in Gaul, and how, for a length of time, they triumphed over all the generals which the imperial city &s;ent to oppo&s;e them, till that memorable epoch, when Marius exterminated with fire and &s;word the innumerable &s;warms that covered the provinces.</P>
<P>The countries, from whence the&s;e &s;elf-bani&s;h|ed banditti came, remained utterly depopu|lated; nor was it till &s;everal ages after, that another &s;et of emigrants &s;eized the &s;ame coun|try, and ro&s;e, by degrees, a comparatively happy and &s;ucce&s;sful nation, on the very ground where &s;o many thou&s;ands of former adven|turers
<PB N="319" REF="380">had peri&s;hed, the victims of their ambi|tion. The Cymbrian nation, till that period, appeared to be annihilated. Tacitus informs us, that, in his time, there remained only the memory of their enterprize.</P>
<P>The Batavians inhabited the banks of the Adriana, now called the Ader, a river which runs between He&s;&s;e, and the country of Waldec. The&s;e people, long harra&s;&s;ed by their avaricious and ambitious enemies, the Cates, re&s;olved to explore a more peaceable &s;ituation. The great i&s;le of Rhine, as it was then called, and which, as I have already ob|&s;erved, had lo&s;t its inhabitants, was the place to which the&s;e new adventurers directed their &s;teps. Encouraged and conducted by the chiefs of their religion; they landed, under favour of a pro&s;perous voyage, on that part of the i&s;land which had been de&s;erted; and, &s;atisfied with a country that had been for&s;aken by its original inhabitants, they determined upon &s;ettlement. The plan was attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that, although we find, in &s;ub&s;equent ages, various other people fixing there al&s;o, the&s;e new coloni&s;ts, alone, rendered the land they occupied famous, and it was only the&s;e who gave it the name of Batavia.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="381">A &s;hort de&s;cription of this i&s;land of Rhine, as it was anciently called, is nece&s;&s;ary; and the be&s;t I can glean for you is, that it is a country detached from the Continent by the Rhine: the right arm of the river &s;till pre&s;erves its name, and, according to general opinion, rolled its rapid waves into the bo&s;om of the ocean, from the place now called Katwick. The left arm is denominated the Waahl, who&s;e &s;treams pre&s;ently join tho&s;e of the Meu&s;e, which al&s;o finds its way to the &s;ea by another va&s;t opening. Hence it appears, that Batavia, now the United Provinces, extended about twenty-&s;even leagues in length, and &s;even in breadth. Many re&s;pectable authors con|tend for a greater &s;cope. Some in&s;i&s;t, that the left arm of the river, which lo&s;t it&s;elf at Kat|wick, &s;ubdivided into &s;everal other branches, which formed a variety of lakes, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable of which was called Flero, and a clu&s;ter of &s;maller i&s;lands, of which the mo&s;t important was that of Schelling.</P>
<P>It is certain, then, what was anciently called Batavia, included a very great part of the pro|vinces of Guelderland, Holland, and Utrecht. At the &s;ame time it &s;eems to be an opinion, wholly unfounded, that the Batavians were
<PB N="321" REF="382">long content with the circum&s;cribed limits which was bounded by the left arm of the Rhine. They pa&s;&s;ed into what was then called Belgic Gaul, between the Meu&s;e and the Waahl. They &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the whole of Guelderland and Holland, and &s;pread them|&s;elves over the delightful country now deno|minated the dutchy of Cleves. There is rea|&s;on to believe they carried their e&s;tabli&s;hments even as far as Zealand, at lea&s;t &s;o much of it as was then habitable: and, in &s;hort, it is ma|nife&s;t, that the people which the Romans called, perhaps, a little confu&s;edly, Batavians, formed by far the greater part of the ancient inhabi|tants of the United States of Holland.</P>
<P>The people called Freezelanders made their appearance, on the &s;tage, about the &s;ame time, and acted a no le&s;s important &s;cene in the great drama of politics. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the provinces of Freezeland, Overy&s;&s;el, and parts adjacent.</P>
<P>You will join my exclamation about the progre&s;s of this extraordinary race of powers! Originally a horde of mi&s;erable wanderers quitting one inho&s;pitable &s;oil for another; chu&s;ing an apparently impracticable &s;pot, and attaching them&s;elves to it, as if proudly deter|mined to make the barren ground, and a world
<PB N="322" REF="383">under water, fruitful, even to abundance. Is it &s;carcely to be credited the&s;e are the people, who on a trembling quagmire founded a more noble city, in de&s;pite as it were of nature her|&s;elf, than the imperial &mdash;? for who that has &s;een Am&s;terdam, but mu&s;t give it the pre|ference to Peter&s;burgh? There is true &s;ublimity in the idea of &s;upporting one of the mo&s;t mag|nificent cities in Europe, on rafts of timber placed upon an enormous bog! Matter of fact is compelled to borrow &s;trength from imagina|tion, to believe &s;uch a miracle, wrought by the toil, indu&s;try, and per&s;everance of human be|ings! And indeed rea&s;on &s;eems to &s;truggle again&s;t her own conviction, when &s;he &s;anctions every word of the following apo&s;trophe:&mdash; "How wonderful!" &s;ays the author of it, "that in a country without a &s;tone or a pebble, there &s;hould be &s;tone edifices the mo&s;t mag|nificent! without fore&s;ts, or an oak tree (two little woods excepted) the Dutch navy &s;hould be the &s;econd in the world! that without arable land they &s;hould &s;upply half Europe with corn, and with a tract of country &s;carcely larger than an Engli&s;h county, they &s;hould rai&s;e men and money to make them&s;elves of im|porrtance in the eyes of the fir&s;t power in Chri&s;tendom!"</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="384">How often, my friend, when I have &s;een the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, have I called to mind a mo&s;t beautiful remark of the excellent Dr. John&s;on, on the united effects of revolu|tion, indu&s;try, and per&s;everance! "The power of <HI>per&s;i&s;ting</HI> is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing, &s;ince all the performances of human art, at which we look with prai&s;e or wonder, are in&s;tances of the re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s force of per&s;everance. It is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid, and that di&s;tant countries are united by canals. If a man were to compare the fir&s;t effect of a &s;ingle &s;troke of the pick-axe or &s;pade, with the ge|neral de&s;ign and la&s;t effect, he would be over|whelmed by a &s;en&s;e of their di&s;proportion; yet the&s;e petty operations, ince&s;&s;antly continued, at la&s;t &s;urmount the greate&s;t difficulties, and mountains are levelled, and oceans bounded, by the &s;lender force of human beings!"</P>
<P>The people we are con&s;idering &s;trongly illu&s;|trate the&s;e &s;entiments, more particularly where it is con&s;idered, that their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors are almo&s;t the only race now in Europe, who have pre|&s;erved, amid&s;t all the convul&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion and of power, their liberty and their country.</P>
<P>The be&s;t manner in which I have ever known this honourable truth explained, is to recol|lect, that the &s;tate it&s;elf was founded on li|berty
<PB N="324" REF="385">and religion, that it was reared by in|du&s;try and oeconomy, and has flouri&s;hed by its commerce and &s;ituation. The bigotted maxims of Philip the Second, the introduction of the inqui&s;ition, and the erecting fourteen new bi&s;hopricks in the Low Countries; the unrelenting rigour of Cardinal Granville, and the &s;ucceeding cruelty of the Duke of Alva, together with the council of twelve, called the Council of Blood, and the execution of Counts Egmont and Horn, were the cau&s;es which drove the people to throw off the yoke, and gave ri&s;e to the union of Utrecht. <HI>Per&s;e|vering</HI> valour, joined to the political a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other powers, has been the means of pre|&s;erving their independence, while the decline of the Venetian navy has made them the common carriers of Europe, and the wars of Flanders, and &s;ituation of Holland, have con&s;pired to render it what it now is.&mdash; The Dutch, likewi&s;e, by the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms again&s;t the Portugue&s;e in India, and by their treaties with the natives, in proce&s;s of time, drew the whole trade of India from Li&s;|bon, which was before the &s;taple of the trade to the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Holland, moreover, is mo&s;t admirably &s;itutated for the commerce of the Baltic, which includes
<PB N="325" REF="386">Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, and the North coa&s;t of Germany, while they &s;end merchandi&s;e into the interior parts of the empire, and Au&s;trian Netherlands, by tho&s;e watery mines of wealth, to them, the Maes, the Rhine, and the Scheld.&mdash;Thus you perceive the greatne&s;s, and much of the vigour, of this country has ari&s;en from a wonderful concur|rence of favourable circum&s;tances&mdash;from a long cour&s;e of time&mdash;from the confluence of &s;trangers, driven either by per&s;ecution, or in|vited by the credit of their government&mdash;from the cheapne&s;s of carriage, by medium of their canals&mdash;from the low intere&s;t of money, and dearne&s;s of land, which con&s;equently turn &s;pecie into trade&mdash;from particular traffic car|ried on at particular places, each town valuing it&s;elf for &s;ome branch of trade: as for in|&s;tance&mdash;Delft for the Dutch porcelain, Sardam for &s;hip-building, Rotterdam for the Scotch and Engli&s;h trade; Am&s;terdam for that of the Straits, Spain, and the Ea&s;t-Indies; and the whole province for the herring fi&s;hery. They are al&s;o indebted much to their inten&s;e appli|cation to their navy, to the va&s;t nur&s;eries for their &s;ailors, and to their oriental acqui&s;i|tions. Such are the circum&s;tances that have
<PB N="326" REF="387">con&s;pired to make this little Republic the ad|miration of the world.</P>
<P>When I next write to you, we will re&s;ume our &s;ketches of the ancient inhabitants, the founders and forefathers of this &s;ingular coun|try: particularly in their exerci&s;es, cu&s;toms, dre&s;&s;es, and habitations, in all which we &s;hall di&s;cover a much &s;tronger re&s;emblance to our own progenitors, than all our good country|men may be di&s;po&s;ed to allow. A&s;&s;uredly, my worthy compatriots ought to be the mo&s;t grateful people to the Great Fountain of all good things of any upon the face of the earth, for the &s;tay-at-home part of them, which is always the majority, cannot be per&s;uaded that he has imparted the light of his counte|nance, or fed with his repleni&s;hing hand, any of their fellow-creatures, in a nearly equal de|gree. The happy i&s;land they inhabit has alone, they &s;uppo&s;e, enjoyed his favour; and to tell them that there are in any other parts of the univer&s;e, as bright a &s;ky, as generous a &s;oil, whole&s;ome laws, as beauteous pro&s;pects, hearts as brave, hands as ingenious, or heads as wi&s;e, would be con&s;idered as among&s;t tho&s;e liberties, which travellers, like poets, are allowed to take with truth.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>YOU ju&s;tly charge me with a digre&s;&s;ion in my la&s;t letter, and at the &s;ame time honour|ably acquit me. In giving you the hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the commerce, and its cau&s;es, I have a little anticipated that part of my information, which &s;hould have been gleaned afterwards: but the ob&s;ervations appeared appo&s;ite to the place where they are introduced, and I think none of their effects can be lo&s;t by your being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them a few pages &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Let us now take up the tangled thread of the early hi&s;tory of the Batavians. Originally Germans, they partook their cu&s;toms, man|ners, and language, frequently their names, and commonly their intere&s;ts. They were as Yoric would &s;ay of them, "of the fir&s;t order of &s;izes," their limbs mu&s;cular, their &s;houlders broad, their eyes blue; yet their countenances fierce: better able to endure the rigours of cold, than the languors of heat; penury than
<PB N="333" REF="390">care; the fatigues of plea&s;ure in the chace, and the plea&s;ures of ambition, or of plunder in the toils of war, than the labours of agriculture and dome&s;tic oeconomy. They could more ea&s;ily &s;upport famine it&s;elf, than the corrod|ings of &s;orrow, from which, indeed, they were pretty &s;ecure, while there was enough left on the face of the earth to &s;u&s;tain its in|habitants. The old Batavians, like the Arabs, could never want what others could &s;upply. The &s;pontaneous good, which nature refu&s;ed to be&s;tow, ready cut and dried to their hands, in the country they had now made their own, they &s;ought and &s;eized upon without any di&s;tinction of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> in another. And, indeed, whatever could not be had with|out trouble at home, they ravi&s;hed abroad; the law of might overcoming right, being the only one they acknowledged: and I fancy, my friend, this &s;ummary code was pretty univer|&s;ally adopted in all the countries of the globe, till the &s;avage of our own &s;pecies, or man in a &s;tate of nature, and as the ca&s;tle builder, Rou&s;&s;eau, calls it, a &s;tate of equality, was taught a very different le&s;&s;on of juri&s;prudence. Na|tural man, and man <HI>made</HI> &s;ocial, no doubt are different &s;ort of per&s;ons, but with all the boa&s;ted refinements, <HI>civilizations,</HI> and <HI>meliora|tions</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="391">of the latter, what a &s;avage he mu&s;t &s;till be to require &s;o many thou&s;and volumes, acts of parliament, &s;tatutes, at little, and at large, to keep the &s;till un&s;ubdued part of his nature, commonly hone&s;t!! Did ever the wilde&s;t cour&s;er of the woods; did ever bea&s;t of prey require &s;o much training, trammelling, muz|zling, chaining, coaxing, correcting, wheed|ling, &s;purning, whipping, goading and halter|ing! And after all, bound hand and foot, and tongue and teeth as he is, he continues to get loo&s;e from his keepers, the lawyers, and &s;nap, &s;cratch, and bite mo&s;t furiou&s;ly. Is not this &s;o &s;elf evident a truth, that before one man dare tru&s;t another; one friend enter into negocia|tions of any kind with the denizen of his bo|&s;om; though he may have been nouri&s;hed with the &s;ame milk, and been rocked in the &s;ame cradle&mdash;mu&s;t not the afore&s;aid keepers double lock, and bolt, and bar, and chain, every door and crevice of the connexion they are about to form! And how often does one or the other, in de&s;pite of all this caution, find a loop hole to creep out at? Still more can the gentle&s;t of gentle creatures, delightful woman her&s;elf! formed as &s;he is by love, and for love, can even &s;he, who &s;eems to wi&s;h or require only bonds of &s;ilk, and fetters of ro&s;es, thrown
<PB N="335" REF="392">about her by Cupid, as if in &s;port; alas and alas, and alas a thou&s;and times!! can this fair being, with any &s;afety, tru&s;t, or be tru&s;ted, in &s;ettling that tender point, which is to deter|mine, by an honourable union, the weal or woe of her life, till the wrecks of our original nature are tied together by contracts, &s;ettle|ments, provi&s;os, conditions, &amp;c. &amp;c. le&s;t any one of the "nice dependencies," of two e&s;pou&s;ed hands and hearts, &s;hould be invaded broken? A dome&s;ticated tyger, who&s;e nature it is expected may break out, is le&s;s watched, le&s;s dreaded, and le&s;s manacled than a modern fine gentleman, or (but remember, I am whi&s;pering this)&mdash;a modern fine lady.</P>
<P>You will have rea&s;on to accu&s;e me of a &s;econd digre&s;&s;ion. Forgive me. I own the&s;e poor old Batavians are &s;adly interrupted, but you are to con&s;ider a Gleaner is a &s;ad wander|ing being, and always &s;tooping to &s;ee what he can pick up: one ear of corn lying here, ano|ther there, it is impo&s;&s;ible he can go &s;trait for|ward, you know, and I once again warn you not to expect it. Nor is it to be de&s;ired. My &s;heaf, which I mean to interweave, and bind with flowers of all kinds, and of all countries, would want variety, and my Gleanings, only
<PB N="336" REF="393">fit for "Daws to peck at." I am ambitious to add &s;weetne&s;s to its &s;trength. You tell me, in &s;everal of your letters, that I have done &s;o: of cour&s;e, I continue the plan that has been honoured with your approbation, and yet I cannot help now and then &s;topping to make an apology.</P>
<P>Even the &s;ports of the old Batavians partook of their aver&s;ion to labour. Tho&s;e games, which flattered with the hope of being ac|quired with little difficulty, and le&s;s attention, were in conformity to their di&s;po&s;itional indo|lence, which they &s;ometimes &s;uffered to put at hazard the only thing they truly valued&mdash; their liberty. They con&s;umed their exce&s;s of lei&s;ure in fea&s;ts, carou&s;als, and &s;leep&mdash;a long trance of the latter being often nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the effects of the other, as what they u&s;ually began in good fellow&s;hip, ended in blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>How different, I cannot but repeat, from the race of the &s;ame men, in progre&s;&s;ive ages! How different even from tho&s;e who in the age immediately &s;ucceeding the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, be|came, as in our own ancient hi&s;tory, often the formidable enemies, and often the powerful
<PB N="337" REF="394">auxiliaries of Rome! And yet how widely re|moved from their hardy, indu&s;trious, indefa|tigable po&s;terity, the late and pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of all that proportion of the globe which ap|pertains to the Dutch nation!</P>
<P>In taking a comparative view of ancient and modern Holland, we cannot but be &s;truck with great a&s;toni&s;hment at the contra&s;t. When the provinces were in their infancy&mdash;when a little colony of emigrating Batavians made their election of a part of the world often cho&s;en, and as often renounced, as an impracticable &s;oil, the wants of nature were accommodated by nature her&s;elf, with all the facility the&s;e, her indolent children, required. They found the waters teeming with fi&s;h, and the land co|vered with cattle: no cities, and few towns, the ancient Germans, regarding the fir&s;t as large, and the latter as &s;o many &s;mall pri&s;ons. The camp was at once their re&s;idence in peace and war, and a field was luckily, for their &s;upine tempers, covered with temporary habitations, without much toil. They could pitch an hun|dred tents in le&s;s time than they could con|&s;truct one regular hou&s;e, and could moreover move them at will from one province to an|other: while many preferred the bare ground,
<PB N="338" REF="395">who&s;e carpet was &s;pread ready to receive them, to any other dwelling-place, living, like the bea&s;ts they fed on, as commoners of nature,
<Q>"Their foot&s;tool earth, their canopy the &s;kies.'"</Q> Long after their primary &s;ettlement, when there were about ten colonies within and without the i&s;land of the Rhine, each colony can|toned in the impa&s;&s;able moors, rather than be at the fatigue of moving farther. Were it po&s;&s;ible, for their hi&s;torian, Tacitus, to come from that "bourne whence no traveller re|turns," and take a &s;urvey of tho&s;e provinces he wrote about in his life-time, and which I am now gleaning for my friend&mdash;were he to ob|&s;erve the then impa&s;&s;able mora&s;&s;es that extend|ed their dreary wa&s;te from province to pro|vince; and to &s;urvey the then u&s;urping and u&s;ele&s;s waters, which inundated the drooping, the almo&s;t drowning, country, <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> converted into a noble republic, embelli&s;hed with &s;ome of the mo&s;t magnificent towns in Europe, thickly inter&s;per&s;ed with beautiful villages:
<Q><L>"The &s;low canal, the yellow-ble&s;&s;om'd vale,</L>
<L>"The willow-tufred bank, the gliding fail,</L>
<L>"The crouded mart, the cultivated plain."</L></Q>
<PB N="339" REF="396">Were he, my friend, to have been the compa|nion of my journey through Holland, North and South, and traver&s;ed with me the fine country of Gueldres&mdash;of all which I &s;hall write you in their place&mdash;and yet more, were he to behold the&s;e very provinces inhabited by the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e very Batavians, who, though endued with every power to &s;uffer every extremity, and to overcome it, refu&s;ed either to toil or &s;pin, now filled with &s;warm|ing multitudes, who&s;e characteri&s;tic is per&s;e|vering indu&s;try, and who, while they have brought every branch of commerce, perhaps to its highe&s;t perfection, have not been un|mindful of the elegant arts, he would &s;carcely be able to find a trace of <HI>his</HI> Batavians, ex|cept in the unaltered feature of hereditary courage.</P>
<P>In the dre&s;s of the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this country, we find a re&s;emblance to that of the ancient Britons. Children of nature, they de|pended on their common parent to furni&s;h them, as well with raiment as with food; the &s;kin of a bea&s;t fa&s;tened with a wooden peg, or a pointed thorn, was wrapped about them. Their chiefs had, by way of di&s;tinction, a ve&s;t made of the &s;ame, and &s;o right, that they
<PB N="340" REF="397">&s;eemed as if ca&s;ed in iron. The women were di&s;criminated only by the addition of a thin veil, bordered with purple. Mo&s;t of them di&s;covered from bli&s;sful ignorance of harm, what the knowledge of the world, in its po|li&s;hed &s;tate, conceals from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. The arms, neck, and bo&s;om, were always di&s;played. Their hair, though naturally of an ardent brown, was deepened by red ochre. They formed their tre&s;&s;es into &s;everal large braids, fa&s;tened at the top of the head with field flowers, not unlike the pre&s;ent mode, but they &s;ometimes &s;uffered the hair to flow in all the liberty and abundance of nature. The men's beards were permitted to grow till they reached the wai&s;t; but on the downfall of an illu&s;trious enemy, &s;lain by their own hands, they were cut &s;hort both before and behind.</P>
<P>When they began to dome&s;ticate, and could be prevailed on to prefer a fixed re&s;idence to a moving tent, they built a local habitation wherever they found the cleare&s;t fountain, the mo&s;t &s;hady thicket, or mo&s;t fruitful meadow, but always on an eminence, either natural or artificial, to guard them from the inundations common to the country they had cho&s;en. They were, of cour&s;e, long ignorant of the thou|&s;and
<PB N="341" REF="398">arts by which civil &s;ociety is embelli&s;hed and advanced. Even when they began a little to civilize, the care of providing for the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life&mdash;their <HI>only</HI> care&mdash;was left to the &s;laves, the freed men, or the women.</P>
<P>Their education was &s;uited to the &s;implicity of their pur&s;uits. Natural courage was taught as the fir&s;t of virtues that ought to be che|ri&s;hed, and a dextrous defence of the body from the attacks of an enemy, as the be&s;t of arts. Intrepidity in combat, contempt of death, and per&s;onal agility, were the three grand points to be acquired. Their con&s;titu|tions, &s;o &s;luggi&s;h in times of peace, took fire at the very thought of war. They would tra|ver&s;e the deepe&s;t &s;nows, and plunge through the mo&s;t turbulent rivers under arms, without even breaking their ranks. Their hor&s;es were neither &s;wift nor &s;trong; and being accu&s;tom|ed always to run a tilt in the &s;traight line, with|out having the &s;malle&s;t idea of the military evolutions, of &s;o much importance in the mo|dern art of war, their principal force and de|pendence was, of cour&s;e, in their infantry. When they were arranged in regular order of battle, they placed their wives and children in the rear, and always certain groupes of both within
<PB N="342" REF="399">view, as well to &s;u&s;tain and excite the valour of the combatants, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t the wounded, and al&s;o to animate the whole army by inter|mingled &s;houts, cries, and acclamations. It was common to &s;ee wives, mothers, daughters, and lovers, ru&s;h amid&s;t the thicke&s;t dangers of the bloody field, carry off the dead, &s;uccour the dying, and &s;uck the reeking wounds of an hu&s;band, father, lover, or brother. Actions of this kind are mentioned in our own hi&s;tory as great and glorious in&s;tances among&s;t indi|viduals: but in the fir&s;t approaches to the im|portance of this little republic, &s;uch heroic atchievements were common to the &s;ex, and hundreds of Boadicea's and Eleonora's were to be &s;een acting wonders in the &s;ame army: nay, it was a part of their office to pur&s;ue and over|take the fugitives, make them return to the charge, and either contribute to victory, or en|counter death.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily believe, my friend, the ef|fect of &s;uch eye witne&s;&s;es of glory and di&s;grace would be great: you feel the &s;trong and lively intere&s;t it mu&s;t have produced on the minds, both of the timid and the brave; that it mu&s;t have converted cowards into men, men into heroes, heroes into conquerors! And you will,
<PB N="343" REF="400">at the &s;ame time, allow, that we &s;hall in vain look for equal enthu&s;ia&s;m, equal prowe&s;s, among&s;t tho&s;e modern mercenaries, who &s;ell their very blood to an unknown ma&s;ter, in who&s;e &s;ervice they engage with <HI>his</HI> enemies for daily bread. In&s;tead of taking the field, like the bold Batavian, at the command of the ge|nerous, at lea&s;t of the glowing pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;tead of fighting an enemy, and embracing a friend on the &s;ame heart-felt principle, the hired &s;ol|dier moves on mechanically to action, without any other idea than to obey. In this automa|ton &s;tate, he is conducted, by his ma&s;ter, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> to conquer or defeat&mdash;
<Q>"Equal to both, and arm'd for either field!"</Q> Of the former he &s;hares not, neither de&s;ires to &s;hare, the glory; nor of the other does he in|cur, or feel, any part of the infamy. Few are the real, &s;carce any the adequate, rea&s;ons, which ju&s;tify the horrors of public war: but the mercenary is left without the &s;hadow of an apology. It is not a nece&s;&s;ary of his life, be|cau&s;e that might be &s;u&s;tained by converting the &s;trength, which is demanded of him in battle, to the arts of peace: his plunder is but a rob|bery licenced by the articles of war; and the murder which he commits in action, is a but|chery
<PB N="344" REF="401">in cold blood. Neither per&s;on, nor pro|perty, king, nor country, bid him un&s;heath the &s;word, or fire the mu&s;ket, &s;pring the mine, or dig the trenches: he is an inveterate bravo, a common &s;tabber to any man that bids up to his price: that done, his ma&s;ter has but to &s;ay&mdash;"Look, ye &s;laves&mdash;tho&s;e are my enemies, whom I have hired you to ma&s;&s;acre: kill as many of them as you can." On a &s;imilar com|pact, in perhaps the next campaign, he turns his arms again&s;t the &s;ide he before e&s;pou&s;ed, and goes on in this manner, letting him&s;elf out, fir&s;t to one leader, then to another.</P>
<P>In the&s;e reflections, you &s;ee my opinion of mercenary troops. I dare &s;ay it is your's: for you are too much a woman of emotion to ap|prove of a man's &s;tanding to be murdered, or to murder, with no better rea&s;on than that it is his trade, and his bloody work is paid for. War is at be&s;t an Hydra calamity! Every man has &s;ome country, &s;ome chief, &s;ome relatives. If he mu&s;t take up arms, let it be for the&s;e. At any rate let him fight on &s;omething like a principle; but the mercenary's very name points out his infamy. Will you tell me a mercenary troop is often brave. Would it were in a better cau&s;e! Yet how I argue! Were
<PB N="345" REF="402"><HI>your</HI> life endangered, my friend, and were the danger to threaten it in a di&s;tant land, far&mdash;far from your friends&mdash;far from me, I would become a mercenary my&s;elf, and fight for an hundred different pay-ma&s;ters, to re|ward the man who &s;hould &s;ave you! Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>ON the article of marriage I have to inform you, that the ancient Batavians con|&s;idered it as infamous to connect them&s;elves in that &s;tate before each party had reached the twentieth year. The conduct of the court&s;hip, even to its final &s;ettlement, was ever in the pre&s;ence of the principals of the two families about to enter into the alliance. This might make love very moral, but &s;urely not very en|tertaining. In the nuptial offerings, the bride|groom always took the lead. They u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ted of a yoke of oxen, a war-hor&s;e capari&s;oned; a &s;word, a lance, and a buckler:
<PB N="346" REF="403">&s;trange love-gifts you will think for a bridal pre&s;ent! but the&s;e warlike &s;ymbols taught, or were intended to teach, the bride to elevate her&s;elf on every great occa&s;ion above the im|puted weakne&s;s of her &s;ex, to partake the labours and dangers, as well as laurels, of her lord, in war and in peace, in life and in death. Having thus armed the fair warrior, the bride pre&s;ented her offerings, which re&s;embled tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, whom &s;he accout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed for the field with equal gallantry, that each might defend the other. Very Gothic to be &s;ure; but perhaps, after all, nearly as good&mdash; &s;en&s;ical as the modern preliminaries of toys and trinkets, &s;ilks and &s;attins, with which a mo|dern Briti&s;h bride, or even a modern Batavian lady, (of whom in due time) is loaded.</P>
<P>As the new married couple could ea&s;ily pro|cure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in their flock-herds and fruits of the earth, and game of their fore&s;ts, (for part of their territory was then well wooded) be&s;ides their corn-cakes, and a kind of beer, which the Batavians, in the mo&s;t early times, were wont to make from their grain, there was little fear of wanting an healthy offspring, which, however numerous, knew no other brea&s;t than that of their mother. Then, my
<PB N="347" REF="404">friend, Refinement, a very puny and puling babe, and of a very delicate con&s;titution, was but ju&s;t born, and had not, among&s;t other un|natural ideas, &s;ugge&s;ted that of committing the pledges of our love to the bo&s;om of a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Their funerals partook the &s;ame &s;implicity. The corp&s;e of a di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on was burned upon a kind of pyre, always with their arms, (a marriage gift) and very often with the hor&s;e that had carried them to battle. A verdant hillock, a gra&s;&s;y eminence, at once co|vered and marked the &s;pot where their a&s;hes were depo&s;ited. The natural affections, too, were in their &s;implicity&mdash;of cour&s;e in their energy. The women honoured the decea&s;ed with &s;uch tears as refinement &s;eldom &s;heds, and breathed over the grave with &s;uch &s;ighs as fa&s;hion rarely heaves; while the men mourned their dead by more &s;ilent &s;orrow, and no le&s;s profound regret.</P>
<P>In regard to religion, the ancient Bata|vians, and the ancient Briton, had &s;omewhat of &s;imilitude. Through all the deep di&s;gui&s;es of fable, which in barbarous ages have always disfigured the truth, one may di&s;cover, among
<PB N="348" REF="405">the Germans, as among the Celtes and the Gauls, the idea of one God Supreme, the prin|cipal, and the pre&s;ervation, and the provi|dence of all. But, in the mo&s;t remote time, we do not find the&s;e people had either temples or idols, holding it equally pre&s;umptuous, profane, and ab&s;urd, to attempt <HI>repre&s;enting</HI> or <HI>enclo&s;ing</HI> the Deiry. They ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t fore&s;ts, in &s;earch of certain trees they con&s;idered to be &s;acred, under who&s;e &s;hade they &s;lew their victims, and, too frequently, Druid-like, mingled the &s;treams of human blood, with tho&s;e of the animals they &s;acrificed. It does not &s;eem probable, if we except the &s;un, moon, and fire, that they had any of the divinities common to the Romans. Their Woden was different from the Oden of the Scandinavians, who at fir&s;t con&s;idered this fa|mous per&s;onage as a hero, then wor&s;hiped him as a God. Woden, Oden, and God, were, perhaps, names &s;ynonimous to &s;ignify Deity.</P>
<P>Nor had the&s;e people le&s;s veneration than our own forefathers for certain oracles and &s;ooth&s;ayers. The&s;e were con&s;ulted on all oc|ca&s;ions of difficulty and danger, and their an|&s;wers were expected with trembling awe, and heard with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive reverence.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="406">As in the &s;weet country to which I have de|voted mo&s;t of our hitherto corre&s;pondence, the ancient Hollanders al&s;o had their bards, who&s;e office it was to &s;ing and celebrate the heroes of their country; their romances, tran&s;mitted with pious care to their po&s;terity, not only &s;erve to perpetuate their own exploits; but to incite in their de&s;cendants an equal emulation. The prophetic poets were principally re&s;orted to in the day of battle, concerning which &s;o minute was the &s;uper&s;tition, that the pre&s;age of good or bad, of victory or defeat, or the degrees of either, depended on the different modulations with which the&s;e warlike &s;ongs were chanted, the very moment preceding the encounter. Like the Romans, they took al&s;o a fortunate or inau&s;picious omen from the flight of birds, or the neighing of hor&s;es, which were fed in con&s;ecrated woods. The i&s;&s;ue of a &s;ingle combat, between one of their own &s;oldiers and a pri&s;oner of war, brought forth to determine their &s;ucce&s;s, or their mi&s;|carriage, was an omen of the utmo&s;t import|ance.</P>
<P>Of their public &s;pectacles little is to be &s;aid. Their young men, however, frequently exhi|bited
<PB N="350" REF="407">one which you will think pretty extraor|dinary; and yet in conformity with the ferocity of their manners. They would jump naked into the middle of a &s;ort of theatre, encircled with lances, leaving only almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible mazes between them, for the whole arrange|ment formed a labyrinth of &s;pears. The dex|terity con&s;i&s;ted in threading the&s;e meanders, and performing the circuit of the whole nar|row, and almo&s;t indi&s;cernable, path, with in|finite rapidity, and without drawing blood: and they thought them&s;elves &s;ufficiently re|warded, if by the&s;e hazardous feats they amu&s;ed the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>Now, my dear friend, among&s;t all the peril|ous arts, which have been invented by idle people in modern times, to entrap the money of per&s;ons, as idle as them&s;elves; &s;ome by &s;wallowing flint&s;tones, &s;ome fire, &amp;c. I think we have never yet matched this plea&s;ant exer|ci&s;e of the youth of old Batavia; and, there|fore, if the enterpri&s;ing A&s;tley, Hughes, or any other great men, who trade in the mar|velous, could attempt &s;omething of this kind, with the improvement, perhaps, of a little <HI>drapery</HI> to the picture&mdash;&s;etting the tour of the lance-&s;urrounded hero to mu&s;ic, it might give
<PB N="351" REF="408">us all the addre&s;s and agility of their mo&s;t expert tumblers and po&s;ture-ma&s;ters, without any of their abominable di&s;tortion.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you were to give one of them the hint, and when the&s;e letters come into volumes, to make him a pre&s;ent of a copy, doubling down the page. By this act of courte&s;ey, you would, at lea&s;t, gain the free <HI>entr&eacute;</HI> of a winter's run to all the jugglers, trick&s;ters, brutes upon two legs, and brutes upon four! Nay, I know not, but the thing might, with better effect, be brought upon the &s;tage, under the title of Harlequin in Old Holland. Wor&s;e &s;cats have been enacted by the hero of the wooden &s;word and truncheon; and if he could but once dance round this Batavian gauntlet <HI>al fre&s;co,</HI> he might bid defiance to the hackneyed, worn out pur|&s;uits of Panteloon, and fooleries of Scara|mouch.</P>
<P>But to leave &s;porting, and return to our pro|per objects. It remains only to &s;ay a few words on the <HI>ancient</HI> legi&s;lation, and public a&s;&s;emblies of the United States. An account of the <HI>modern</HI> government &s;hall not be for|gotten.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="409">When they began to legi&s;late, which was not till long after their &s;ettlement in this country, the &s;overeignty re&s;ided in a kind of National Convention. It was there, that their freemen and nobles inaugurated their generals and kings: there that they elected their centurions, tribunes, and judges, to di&s;|tribute ju&s;tice, through their colonies: there that their fir&s;t Diet was e&s;tabli&s;hed, either at new or full moon, when all &s;ubjects were di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, and propo&s;itions made for peace or war. The unanimity of the &s;uffrage de|termined the mea&s;ure: if the &s;pectators clap|ped their hands, the ayes had it; and if a tumultuous murmur followed the propo&s;al, the noes carried the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In this little &s;enate's origin, every man ap|peared armed. When the youths had gained a certain age, they were admitted as members, and on the day&mdash;if I may be permitted to u&s;e parliamentary language&mdash;that they took their &s;eats, they were pre&s;ented with a javelin and buckler. They were then to be con&s;idered as connecting the characters of &s;enator and &s;ol|dier, and expected to contribute their &s;ervices to the government, and defence of the &s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="410">With re&s;pect to the monarchy of the rude ages of the Batavian people, the name of king has been too generally confounded with that of chief. Whatever was then his title, his power exceeded not that of the fir&s;t citizen: there was always an appeal, from his authority, to the &s;en&s;e of the public: and if his elevation in&s;pired any &s;entiment, or carried him into any action, that wore but the &s;emblance of tyranny, or that trenched upon tho&s;e to whom he owed his di&s;tinctions, he was, in&s;tantly, marked, and controlled as one who had violated his tru&s;t, and incurred the penalty of &s;uch forfeiture.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature of the country demands a few more ob&s;ervations: for even in the infancy&mdash; the babyhood, of Batavian juri&s;prudence, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome laws were framed, though their code was little more than what was taught by a &s;en&s;e of natural ju&s;tice: and, per|haps, that is con&s;cience at the &s;ame time. The very people who, in their mo&s;t barbarous &s;tate, fed their indolence by inva&s;ion of public and private rights, in proce&s;s of time, began to contemplate with horror, and with &s;hame, a life of lazine&s;s and rapacity. They were indu&s;trious; and on indu&s;try grew the &s;enti|ments
<PB N="344" REF="411">both of property and probity, and they &s;oon enacted laws to tie up them|&s;elves, as well as others, from the farther violation of the&s;e.</P>
<P>They were, however, &s;imple and conci&s;e. The &s;uperior magi&s;trates in the great di&s;tricts, and the inferior ones in the towns and villages, conducted the proce&s;s. It was carried on without any &s;ort of dif|ficulty or delay, and what will equally con|found our modern lawyers, without any ex|pence. The cau&s;e was tried in open court, and invariably ended the <HI>day it was begun,</HI> without a po&s;&s;ibility of farther appeal. Neither written laws, nor printed &s;tatutes, were known, or nece&s;&s;ary to be known. Privileges, rights, and wrongs, when well defended and &s;ettled <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae</HI> remain for ever clear, and were men as hone&s;t as they are artful, would require but one hearing and one deci&s;ion. A twenty, or even a fifth year's &s;uit in Chancery, would have &s;ounded in Batavia, like putting off the final i&s;&s;ue to the day of judgment. But, I am aware that &s;ociety in its highe&s;t &s;tate of population, power, and pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t
<PB N="345" REF="412">have its wrongs mingled with its rights; and they are &s;o twi&s;ted together, by a variety of intere&s;ts, that we mu&s;t take them, ju&s;t as we find them, worked into the piece. So may the <HI>laws</HI> flouri&s;h, and we enjoy their protection, my friend, without either incurring their cen|&s;ure, or wanting their active interference; for, perhaps, as many hone&s;t men have been ruined by their friend&s;hip, as there have been knaves de&s;troyed by their enmity.</P>

<P>HAVING thus taken a tran&s;ient view of "the family canva&s;s," in the long picture gallery of times pa&s;t, we &s;hall be more amu&s;ed to look at, and better able to judge of, the portraits of the lineal de&s;cendants; in fine, we &s;hall, with more profit, and more plea&s;ure, catch the re&s;embling &s;imilitudes, ob&s;erve where the im|pre&s;&s;ion of original character has been pre|&s;erved, or lo&s;t; and from this progre&s;&s;ive &s;urvey inve&s;t our&s;elves with the power of com|paring progenitors with their po&s;terity, in all that regards the principles and pur&s;uits of both.

<P>Meantime, as what I have already exported, will make a pretty con&s;iderable &s;heaf, I &s;hall beg of you, to look upon this letter as the band
<PB N="347" REF="414">to make it up! and, as every harve&s;t-home, is accompanied by &s;igns of &s;atisfaction, that the grain is got in, &s;uch as garlands, &s;ongs, &amp;c. &amp;c. as not even the humble&s;t Gleaner, who has picked her &s;canty portion from day to day, through all the lea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on, but adorns the la&s;t handful with a few field flowers, and carols over them as &s;he bends her way to her cottage, I propo&s;e to crown our little harve&s;t-home, my friend, with a wreath of poetry, to which there appertains a long &s;tory; but which, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, a mind like your's will find &s;hort in the narration, when the time is ripe to "a&s;k your hearing patiently," as the player &s;ays in Hamlet.</P>
<P>Much have I for your fancy, your feelings, your affection; much for your information, and &s;omething for your u&s;e.

<P>I am really concerned to find every where, and about every thing, the repre&s;entations of a truth in many re&s;pects &s;o different, and in
<PB N="349" REF="416">not a few &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the truth it&s;elf. Men, women, places, people, manners, cu&s;toms, are all &s;o drawn into this fal&s;e colouring, and are &s;o thrown out of their due proportions of mind and body, &s;ituation and circum&s;tance; here a caricature, there a figure, &s;o ful&s;omely flattered, that a friend that loves one would be di&s;gu&s;ted; and in &s;hort, things, as they are, &s;o very generally differ from what they are &s;aid to be, that in what&s;oever I can, I am fully re&s;olved to form my opinions on the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es; as, in all human ca&s;es, the only proof po&s;itive, and in whatever falls &s;hort of this oral, and ocular conviction, (&s;till humanly &s;peaking) to believe whatever is of good re|port, as much as I dare; and of evil, no more than I can po&s;&s;ibly help.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the tales of travellers, tho&s;e of the Genii and Fairies, are not more fanciful or fallacious, when they choo&s;e to throw the rein upon the neck of prejudice, or imagina|tion, which they are very often &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to do. The tricks they play on their readers are the more dangerous, when they are expert enough at illu&s;ion, to keep on this &s;ide
<PB N="350" REF="417">of the line of probability, which can neither on, or off the &s;tage be violated, without counter|acting the effect intended to be produced.</P>
<P>What would you think of me, &s;aid a &s;prightly young man, in a letter to his rela|tion, the Barone&s;s De S&mdash;, what would you think of your cou&s;in, and corre&s;pondent, who &s;tops only to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and when re|fre&s;hed, writes to you <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant;</HI> were he in imitation of many travellers, to give him&s;elf the airs of a dictator, and talk of the di&s;po&s;i|tions of a people, the cu&s;toms of a country, their finance, their government, their pa&s;&s;ions, their pur&s;uits, ri&s;quing every thing, fearing nothing; not even the deri&s;ion and contempt of the friend he addre&s;&s;es! How, in fact, is it po&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;ending fal&s;ehoods of one country into another, when running from country to country, as if in a fox-chace, without knowledge of the language, without becoming &s;tationary among&s;t the people, with|out comparing the living volume with the dead letter, with many &s;ocial, and many &s;ilent opportunities, a true <HI>idea,</HI> much le&s;s a faith|ful de&s;cription, of men and things, &s;hould be given. If a traveller <HI>en gallop,</HI> would content him&s;elf with "catching the manners as they
<PB N="351" REF="418">ri&s;e before him at the moment," his etching might often be agreeable, always ju&s;t, as far as it went; but he mu&s;t be an hi&s;torian, a poli|tician, a philo&s;opher, and take up his pen to convince his private friend, and, perhaps, the world, that he knows, or can know no more of the matter than a courier, or a run|ning footman. I touched on this folly before, my dear friend, but I have &s;ince that time, been &s;o mi&s;led by tru&s;ting to fal&s;e guides; have lo&s;t &s;o much of my time, and my money, by their advice about the di&s;tribution of it, that, that&mdash;in fine, that le&s;t I &s;hould lo&s;e my temper into the bargain, I will only re-a&s;&s;ure you it is not without <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> the United Pro|vinces have been often called the compen|dium of the univer&s;e, and that notwith&s;tand|ing a very entertaining traveller has declared, in a kind of epigrammatic tour, that he has publi&s;hed&mdash;Martin Sherlock&mdash;the cardinal vir|tue of a Dutchman is cleanline&s;s; his only Gods, Mercury and Plutus, and as for the Nine Si&s;ters, and Apollo, they were never heard of in the country; notwith&s;tanding, it is in&s;i&s;ted upon in a volume of our univer&s;al hi&s;tory, that the Dutch are cold, phlegmatic, brutal, without a ray of invention, a &s;hadow of

<HEAD>LETTER I. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>ON a &s;urvey of my &s;tores, however, under the article "<HI>Scraps,</HI> or Single Wheat Ears, and Field Flowers, collected in Hol|land, and arranged at the Brielle," the place whence I culled the fragrant Bandeau, which binds the Gleaning I la&s;t &s;ent you, I judge it be&s;t to attach them to this my fir&s;t &s;heaf. You will, therefore, receive them herewith, in &s;ome Supplementary Letters, ju&s;t as you may have ob&s;erved an indu&s;trious day-labourer in
<PB N="358" REF="426">the lea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on, following his gleaning family home, gathering up the ears that may drop from their plea&s;ing burthens, as they bear them to the cottage. And fir&s;t I &s;hall offer to your feelings &s;ome emigrant hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>Even <HI>before</HI> the cloud broke into flame, it was, really, afflicting to &s;ee, in pa&s;&s;ing the Frontiers of Germany, the &s;ituation of the French emigrants, the greater part of whom were of the fir&s;t rank, and reduced, like tho&s;e of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the good faith, and good will, of tho&s;e, in who&s;e towns, and villages, they had taken refuge. But good will, and good faith, like all other things, have their bound; and, like all other things, too, are &s;ubject to contingence. I &s;taid long enough in the different retreats of the&s;e un|happy people, to perceive, that the protection, at fir&s;t offered, was among&s;t the objects of this changeable world, that &s;hew early &s;igns of earthly mutability. Whether tendered, in the beginning, by urbanity, pity, or politics, the warmth of the welcome began to abate. I &s;aw, but too often, the altered air of the ho&s;t cut into the heart of his gue&s;t. The protections were not, indeed, nay are not, even yet, with|drawn; but infinitely different is the being en|dured
<PB N="359" REF="427">and invited, being &s;uffered to remain, and &s;ollicited to continue.</P>
<P>The &s;evere chagrin, which this cau&s;ed in an high-&s;pirited, and high-born &s;et of men, (who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility is always in proportion to rank, habits, and education) may ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed; but their endeavours to <HI>conceal</HI> that chagrin from the people, with whom they have taken refuge, and yet more from the lower orders of their own country, exhibited to the ob&s;erving eye, a picture truly touch|ing. Prior to the breaking out of the war, I was at Neuwied and Coblentz, (at the latter place, you remember, I died), and from the&s;e towns, (notwith&s;tanding my death), I pa&s;&s;ed into many others while ho&s;tilities were pre|paring: and I found, wherever the French emigrants were permitted to have "a local habitation," you might &s;ee this inward &s;truggle betwixt <HI>blood and &s;ituation.</HI> I fre|quently ob&s;erved the expatriated Noble&s;&s;e, gather together towards evening in the &s;uburbs, &s;urrounded by &s;everal hundreds of their ad|herents, not to abu&s;e the time, but to engage in all tho&s;e manly exerci&s;es, which &s;erved a triple purpo&s;e: Fir&s;t, to hide their regret from common &s;pectators: &s;econdly, to obviate, for a
<PB N="360" REF="428">time, the &s;en&s;e of their condition: thirdly, to &s;upport and cultivate that &s;trength of body and mind, which grief and idlene&s;s might impair. I took notice that their &s;words were either at their &s;ides, or lying by them, even in their &s;ports. But <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was lodged in the &s;ame hotel with a number of the&s;e un|happy gentlemen &s;ome months.</NOTE> <HI>after</HI> all this, I have followed them into their private apartments, where their minds, no longer on the &s;tretch, relaxed and yielded to the truth of circum&s;tance. Yet without particularizing, the general &s;urvey was lamentable: Many thou&s;ands of human beings, in the highe&s;t rank, and of the highe&s;t talents, bred to the enjoyment and expenditure of ample fortunes, driven from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the plea&s;ante&s;t, gaye&s;t, and mo&s;t agreeable country of the world, or what very lately was &s;uch, of great natural vivacity, and of habitual elegance, all of them reduced by (what, at lea&s;t, to <HI>them</HI> appears) a virtue in exce&s;s, the love of their king, their country, the maintainance of their hereditary rights, and the recovery of their patrimonial honour. My friend, how|ever the&s;e unfortunates may fare, on your &s;ide of the German Ocean, I have &s;een hundreds of them, on this &s;ide, con&s;trained, like the poor &s;oldier, to take their cold lodging on a bed of &s;traw; their nouri&s;hment coar&s;e as their bed,
<PB N="361" REF="429">far from their friends, their wives, their children; their e&s;tates confi&s;cated, them&s;elves exiled.</P>
<P>Was not all this, and much more, that might, with too much truth be added, enough to break down the highe&s;t &s;pirit, and unbrace the &s;tronge&s;t arm? Stand they not, according to the expre&s;&s;ion of a great Divine, "in the fir&s;t rank of objects of our &s;ympathy, en|titled, not only to relief, but, re&s;pect and vene|ration?" A &s;et of men, born in, and inured to, far le&s;s poli&s;hing, and, as they are u&s;ually thought, more ema&s;culating circum&s;tances, &s;uch as a cold country, a rigorous di&s;cipline, and a le&s;s ardent temperament, might &s;eem wanting to &s;upport this &s;ad rever&s;e. For Frenchmen, and more particularly for French <HI>nobility,</HI> to bear it with an equal mind, (with|out taking into the account, the <HI>rapidity</HI> of a tran&s;ition from the livelie&s;t and mo&s;t abund|ant, to the mo&s;t gloomy and un&s;upplied &s;tate), certainly &s;hews of what the&s;e once airy &s;pirits are capable, when called out by an extraordi|nary occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>From the&s;e primary &s;urveys, I plainly fore|&s;aw, what has &s;ince happened, viz. that when the&s;e wretched wanderers did come into action,
<PB N="362" REF="430">they would maintain their &s;hare in the dreadful day of open rupture, as firmly, and as bravely, as if they had never known a &s;oftne&s;s, or in|dulged a luxury. But <HI>long before</HI> the time was ripe to enter the field of blood, it would have wrung your heart, to have &s;een the unaccom|modated &s;ituation of thou&s;ands, who have &s;ince &s;hed their blood in <HI>la Vend&eacute;e,</HI> a name not to be mentioned without an a&s;&s;ociation of horrors and &s;acrifices, from which every reflecting mind mu&s;t turn with <HI>&s;huddering &s;ympathy:</HI> for, if ever human creatures were devoted on <HI>all &s;ides,</HI> the&s;e are they who mu&s;t everla&s;tingly &s;tand in the fir&s;t rank of victims; and whether their de&s;truction aro&s;e from the cold delays of policy, or from the malice of adver&s;e fortune, the families, the legions, the armies, the almo&s;t <HI>miriads</HI> of per&s;ons who found untimely graves in that ill-&s;tay'd country, are the mo&s;t to be honoured, compa&s;&s;ionated, and deplored. Peace to their a&s;hes, and recompence to their &s;ouls!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD &s;carce entered the Hotel, on my fir&s;t vi&s;it to this town, when the death of the late Emperor was announced by an expre&s;s, who came into the Inn yard, from Vienna, illu&s;trating the expre&s;&s;ion of the Great Engli&s;h Poet, where he tells us a Cavalier had,
<Q>"Spurr'd his proud Cour&s;er hard, and rode in blood."</Q></P>
<P>Although the decea&s;ed was as well beloved of his &s;ubjects, as it is in the nature of things to be, it is amazing with what philo&s;ophical compo&s;ure this event was received, by all who were not per&s;onally, or politically intere&s;ted. Being, my&s;elf, neither the one nor the other, I mention it, but to tell you the &s;urprize of a very large company, on my informing them, while &s;itting at a table d'hote &s;upper, that, as their emperor and king was dead, I &s;hould put on my &s;uit of &s;ables. For what? have you the honour to be related? Related! No: but I pre&s;ume every gentleman who can com|mand
<PB N="364" REF="432">a black coat, will wear it on this occa|&s;ion, at lea&s;t, every gentleman, who re&s;ides in the German dominions.</P>
<P>Not an individual in the whole empire, re|plied my next neighbour, except tho&s;e of the royal family, and its immediate connections; with the officers of the hou&s;ehold.</P>
<P>Very &s;trange, Sir: our Engli&s;h taylors work double tides, to get mourning ready, in time, for the general order.</P>
<P>Order! what are you then commanded?</P>
<P>Yes: both by etiquette and cu&s;tom. Not a gentleman, lady, or decent trader in the realm, will think him&s;elf entitled to appear, among&s;t even his familiar friends, unle&s;s he conforms to the rule, which in our private parties, and public places, is almo&s;t without an exception. Within eight and forty hours after the news gets to England, its inhabitants will all be as black as the Styx, and &s;o remain 'till another edict of the Lord Chamberlain, who is our Grand Ma&s;ter of little ceremonies, tells our &s;ympathy, it may a&s;&s;ume a &s;lighter &s;hade, and fix, at the &s;ame time, the period of our re|gaining our robes of colour.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="433">Mon&s;ieur Anglois, cried a profound per|&s;onage at the farther end of the table, your's is a mighty &s;ympathizing nation truly! but though we love our &s;overeigns, perhaps, more than you, we mourn for them in our hearts, and do not hang the trappings of our &s;orrow on our backs: nor are we &s;ingle in this mat|ter; our neighbours of Holland, will be no blacker next week, than <HI>u&s;ual,</HI> (here our Ger|man wit &s;miled &s;ignificantly) even though, you know, the alliances of the Hou&s;es of Orange, Pru&s;&s;ia, and England, compo&s;e a &s;ort of fa|mily compact.</P>
<P>They told me &s;imply the truth, with re&s;pect to them&s;elves and the Dutch, for, in pa&s;&s;ing back into the United Provinces, a few days after, then returning into Germany, by way of We&s;tphalian Pru&s;&s;ia, I met with but three &s;ets of beings, arrayed in the mourning garb, to wit, &s;ome of the friars, the crows, and the blackbirds. Notwith&s;tanding which, there &s;eems, to me, a dignity, and decorum, in this cu&s;tom, which attaches me to it.</P>
<P>The event it&s;elf, even in the in&s;tant it hap|pened, &s;eemed in no degree to have checked the de&s;igns of the emigrants. No form of
<PB N="366" REF="434">words can paint to you, the vehemence, the in|dignation, the almo&s;t in&s;anity, with which, (in a journey through the different parts of the empire,) I have heard their grievances di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, their wrongs de&s;cribed, their rights a&s;&s;erted, and their ravages anticipated. To the&s;e vio|lences, if there could po&s;&s;ibly be found (in the language of pa&s;&s;ions) a parallel, it would be heard in the phrenzies of the Revolutioni&s;ts. Even at the time of which I am &s;peaking, both parties were in a ferment, beyond the reach of, perhaps, <HI>any</HI> compari&s;on, in ancient or modern hi&s;tory. But what is extremely curious in this di&s;pute, is, that while the Emigrants in&s;i&s;t, that <HI>they them&s;elves,</HI> are made up of gentry, men of property, and nobility; nothing being left in France, except its refu&s;e; the favourers of the Republic aver, that no man has <HI>left</HI> his native land, who was worthy to &s;tay in it: meantime, allowance being made for the&s;e overcharged animo&s;ities on both &s;ides, it was palpable; that when the gathering &s;torm bur&s;t, it would pour down the torrents of human blood, which <HI>have</HI> &s;ince deluged the land.</P>
<P>In regard to the <HI>expatriated</HI> French, I can &s;peak to the claims of &s;everal, to all that ad|miration, or &s;ympathy, can offer, (and they
<PB N="367" REF="435">have given largely &s;ince, e&s;pecially in the Bri|ti&s;h dominions.) About the time that the armies of Dumourier were upon the point of &s;eizing the Republic of Holland, in the &s;um|mer of 1793. I was, as you well remember, among&s;t the number of tho&s;e who did not think it prudent to wait the event of a threat, which was expected with anxiety by every man. But, re&s;olved to wait till the la&s;t, apparently &s;afe, minute, I re&s;orted to the hou&s;e of a friend, which lying in the highway pa&s;&s;age to Helveot|&s;luice, I had an opportunity of Gleaning many hundreds&mdash;I might &s;afely write thou&s;ands of tho&s;e, who were ha&s;tening to England: and, as my friend's hou&s;e, was partly appropriated to the &s;ervice of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, they were obliged to make a &s;top, officially; their pa&s;&s;ports from Holland to the Briti&s;h &s;hore, being attainable only from this quarter. And, farther, my friend, uniting much private worth with his public character, very many of the&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons were &s;o "gaily and &s;milingly pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay," that &s;o long as the danger of the French army was not immediate, they profited of his ho&s;pitality for two or three days together. By the&s;e means princes, ge|nerals, chevaliers, women of quality, and whole bodies of the prie&s;thood, pa&s;&s;ed under my
<PB N="368" REF="436">eye; and I had made my Gleaning of their minds, manners, and preten&s;ions; their mi&s;e|ries at home, and their hard&s;hips abroad, before they had gained our protecting country.</P>
<P>In truth, the hou&s;e above alluded to, gave them a very favourable impre&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h courte&s;y; for, being compo&s;ed of the elegant wife and blooming daughters of my friend, the&s;e children of misfortune met a variety of <HI>agr&eacute;mens,</HI> well &s;uited to their pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances. It would have charmed you to have &s;een as I did, the family endeavours to di&s;&s;ipate the chagrin, too heavy, not to be ob&s;erved, in the countenances, and heard in the &s;ighs, of many of the &s;ufferers.
<Q><L>"Their ge&s;tures &s;ad,</L>
<L>Inve&s;ting lank-lean cheeks, or war-worn coats;</L>
<L>Pre&s;enting them unto the gazing moon,</L>
<L>So many horrid gho&s;ts.</L></Q> It was truly piteous to hear this ruined band de&s;cant on their general, or particular misfor|tunes; the infinite lo&s;&s;es they &s;u&s;tained, before they left their own country; the difficulty and di&s;order in which they quitted it; the extor|tions made upon them, both by land, and by water, in their pa&s;&s;age. A Dutch landlord,
<PB N="369" REF="437">for in&s;tance, had in&s;i&s;ted on a &s;mall party pay|ing <HI>five French crowns</HI> for tea, milk, and a little dry bread!</P>
<P>I was extremely intere&s;ted by three Che|valiers of different orders of merit, who came together, always united by friend&s;hip, and now more &s;trongly knit by the cement of mis|fortune. Of the&s;e, one produced written te&s;timonies of having twice &s;aved the life of Louis XVI. His wife was left in hazard at Paris; his faithful dome&s;tic who followed him to the wars, was taken pri&s;oner, and hanged at Li&s;le. Another had e&s;caped with his lady to Dieppe, but was there con&s;trained to leave her, and the third had been lucky enough to bring away his wife in di&s;gui&s;e; but &s;ince had the misfortune to under&s;tand that his children, who were in one of the Provinces, for education, had been &s;eized upon, and brought to the guillotine, to atone for the crimes of their parents; the crimes of loyalty to their king, and &s;aving them&s;elves from death, tru&s;ting that the innocent children would be no objects of that univer&s;al <HI>edict of blood,</HI> which has &s;ince been i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>The name of the fir&s;t of the&s;e gentlemen was St. Leger; of a noble per&s;on, and a noble
<PB N="370" REF="438">mind; covered over with laurels, and the wounds by which they were acquired. With|out ga&s;conade, he bade me take note of them, as they &s;tood di&s;played in different parts of his body&mdash;&s;ome received at Pondicherry, in a former war; &s;ome in Flanders; mo&s;t of them by <HI>Briti&s;h &s;hot;</HI> but <HI>all,</HI> Sir, exclaimed the Marquis, (&s;uch was his title) in the &s;ervice of <HI>my</HI> &s;overeign, and I am &s;ure that will be a &s;uffi|cient apology to the forgivene&s;s, and a &s;ufficient motive to the protection of <HI>your</HI> &s;overeign.</P>
<P>He renounced the name of Frenchman, he &s;aid, and gloried that he was of Iri&s;h ance&s;try; nor do I renounce only a Frenchman's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;idering him as an officer, and friend to the Prince, who had been his benefactor, we mu&s;t allow him this latitude.</NOTE> <HI>name,</HI> Sir, &s;aid the Marquis, but a Frenchman's <HI>language,</HI> and the very moment I can recover that of England, I &s;hall deem it do&s;loyal, nay a crime, to &s;peak a tongue in common with the traitors of a king, whom I have defended from my earlie&s;t youth, and whom I will continue to love, and honour, to my late&s;t age.</P>
<P>I think my knowledge of the human heart, warrants me, (without too much relying on the
<PB N="371" REF="439">human voice, or human countenance), in a&s;&s;erting, that he &s;poke with &s;incerity, when he &s;aid, farther, that if he could &s;ave his de|voted ma&s;ter, by the lo&s;s of his left hand, or right, (extending both while he a&s;&s;everated) he would offer them up with joy, and ki&s;s the hand of the man appointed to cut them off!</P>
<P>His per&s;onal character of Louis, founded, as he a&s;&s;ured me, on per&s;onal knowledge, differed, e&s;&s;entially from the common received opinion. The Marquis de St. Leger, repre&s;ented him not only as a man of general goodne&s;s, but of ge|neral knowledge, of great reading, ob&s;erva|tion, and courage. Of the latter, he in&s;tanced as follows. When the cannon of the enraged populace were dragged into his palace, and the &s;words of fifty blood thir&s;ty hirelings, were at his throat, and when a&s;ked by the ringleaders, whether LOUIS <HI>was not afraid?</HI> He took hold of one of the grenadiers arms, de&s;iring him to feel whether the heart of Louis palpitated with any of the da&s;tard emotions imputed to it? But he mu&s;t die, Sir, added the Marquis, I fore&s;ee, Sir, that Louis XVI. <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;oon die. It is according to the new &s;y&s;tem, that he &s;hould be de&s;troyed: nor will any part of his
<PB N="372" REF="440">ill-fated family, left in France, fare better than him&s;elf! <HI>They are all pro&s;cribed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;trength of the axiom, &s;elf pre&s;ervation, is the fir&s;t of Nature's laws, we will not a&s;k, why the Marquis, or any other per&s;on, who fore&s;aw the death, and had been benefitted by the life, of Louis XVI. left him to his fate.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>How far this prophecy is fulfilled, my dear friend, you need not be told.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening on which the&s;e conver&s;ations took place, the three Chevaliers took a mea&s;ure, (and, perhaps, an inadequate and partial one) of each other's particular &s;ituation, each admitted a &s;imilitude in <HI>general</HI> calamity, but each thought &s;ome trait of harder, and more difficult fortune was appropriate in particular to him&s;elf! The two who had been compelled to leave their wives in an enemy's land, of cour&s;e con&s;idered <HI>their</HI> Lot as the mo&s;t &s;evere; while the third, who&s;e children had fallen &s;acrifices to their parents &s;ecurity, &s;eemed to think the fate of his two friends more tolerable than his own.</P>
<P>I have the conver&s;ation of the Counte&s;s, my wife, it is true, &s;aid the Count de R&mdash;, and no man can be more &s;en&s;ible of dome&s;tic con&s;ola|tion than I am; but, as there &s;eems-to me no apparent <HI>end,</HI> to the horrors of France, and as
<PB N="373" REF="441">the &s;light means with which we have provided our &s;elves, are already on the decline, I know not whether death it&s;elf would not have been a ble&s;&s;ing to me, rather than living to &s;ee my &s;lender finances dimini&s;h daily, and the beloved of my &s;oul condemned to forget, or remember with angui&s;h, the decent pride of hereditary and habitual independence, or be in danger of &s;tarving under the eyes of a tender hu&s;band. As to the latter grievance, it can <HI>never come to pa&s;s,</HI> ob&s;erved the Counte&s;s, while we have both of us &s;o much youth, health, and affection. And though my inward &s;oul bewails the lo&s;s of our loved children; yet, as their innocent lives mu&s;t have en&s;ured them eternal happine&s;s, there are moments when I <HI>congratulate them and our&s;elves</HI> on their being placed beyond the reach of the tygers, who now infe&s;t our country; and who would have drank their blood.</P>
<P>Yes, dear Count, their lot is no longer to be deplored, and I have almo&s;t cea&s;ed to grieve for them.&mdash;</P>
<P>During every &s;entence of this declaration, her tears fell in abundance, and &s;he exhibited all the agonies of a mother, who had lo&s;t her children, while &s;he talked of re&s;ignation.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="442">The amiable family, under who&s;e ho&s;pitable roof, the&s;e unfortunates were now received, tried the magic of their various accompli&s;h|ments to charm away the no le&s;s various di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their gue&s;ts. The different en|chantments of mu&s;ic, conver&s;e, and cards, were, by turns, put in force, and had their effects: but what &s;eemed mo&s;t to intere&s;t and amu&s;e, was putting together one of the wooden maps of Europe, invented, it is &s;aid, for the improvement of the young and happy, but cal|culated, as it appeared in this in&s;tance, to &s;ooth the wretched, and the mature. As the compo|nent parts of this play-thing were pre&s;ented in di&s;order, the emigrants began to arrange; in progre&s;s of which they had no little difficulty. The Marquis was for throwing <HI>France,</HI> wholly out of the Map, being no longer worthy, he &s;aid, to fill a &s;pace in the Continent of Europe. This was oppo&s;ed by his friend, who fa&s;tened with a tender &s;ort of mi&s;ery on <HI>Dieppe,</HI> where he had la&s;t left his wife, but he agreed partially to eject <HI>Paris:</HI> to this propo&s;al, however, the other, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, objected, for the like rea&s;on, with the additional one of its being &s;till the re&s;idence of his beloved king, who&s;e very pri&s;on hou&s;e was precious. And both the counte&s;s, and her hu&s;band, were for pre&s;erving
<PB N="375" REF="443">all the cities, towns, and villages, which &s;till contained their &s;urviving friends.

<P>In the packet-boat, which (&s;ome time after this little adventure) took me to England, there were not le&s;s than eighty emigrant French, on their pa&s;&s;age to London. I had rea&s;on to know that they left other countries either by com|mand of the Governors, or from terror of an approaching enemy, and that the greater part of them, &s;o far from having wherewith to make London a comfortable re&s;idence, had barely &s;uf|ficient to pay their fare, at an <HI>indulged</HI> price, over the water. Yet meeting with a few per|&s;ons who <HI>had been in Paris,</HI> who de&s;cribed its &s;plendours, its &s;educing elegancies, and its amu&s;ing trifles, they forgot the pre&s;ent in the pa&s;t, and were, by no means, the lea&s;t gay, or merry, of the crew. Half &s;eas over, however, one of the &s;ailors de&s;cried from the ma&s;t a ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="377" REF="445">of an unpromi&s;ing appearance, bearing down upon us, and favoured by the wind. The Cap|tain pronounced it to be a French privateer, and, as far as his gla&s;&s;es could determine, one that would take them captive with a &s;ingle broad&s;ide. At the clo&s;e of this information, he ob&s;erved, that, though it would be a vain effort, it was his duty to clear the &s;hip for fight|ing. This was accordingly done, and the emi|grants were not the lea&s;t alert in the preparation, nor would they, it is likely, have been the lea&s;t vigorous in the action; but, on &s;ome of them the dread of falling into the hands of their im|placable countrymen was &s;o great, that in ca&s;e of defeat, they came to the de&s;perate re&s;olve of becoming their own executioners in the &s;hort interval betwixt the giving up the packet-boat, and the boarding of her by the conquerors. The alarm increa&s;ed as the ve&s;&s;el approached, and the re&s;olution became &s;o &s;olemn, that each man who meant to adopt it, pledged his honour to his friend. Po&s;&s;ibly it might, in a ca&s;e of death, be the lea&s;t evil in point of &s;ufferance and &s;hame, however it might violate the laws of morality and religion. It was, luckily, an unnece&s;&s;ary alternative: for the ve&s;&s;el coming near enough to be &s;atisfied &s;he had been in cha&s;e of an Engli&s;h packet boat, proved her|&s;elf
<PB N="378" REF="446">to be an Engli&s;h frigate; and &s;oon &s;tood off, in the direction &s;he had quitted on fir&s;t ob|&s;erving us. "After all, &s;he's <HI>one of us,"</HI> cried the captain.

<P>Tho&s;e who had the mo&s;t de&s;pairing thoughts had now the gaye&s;t ideas, and &s;uch as had been mo&s;t agile in preparing for war, gave proof of agility in the contrary extreme of preparing for peace, for they leaped, laughed, &s;ung, and even played, as it were, with the edge of the guillo|tine: one facetiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that he fancied his neck (feeling it) was too <HI>&s;hort</HI> to be fitted to the in&s;trument; and another cunningly &s;aid, though he did not think <HI>his</HI> neck too <HI>&s;hort,</HI> he hoped it would be <HI>long enough</HI> before any ex|periment was made upon it, by <HI>Me&s;&s;. les Re|publicains;</HI> while a third gentleman (with a &s;hrug which would have a&s;certained his coun|try, had every other te&s;timony been wanting) remarked, <HI>"Ma foi, c&eacute;tte dame Guillotine e&s;t un per&s;onage bien commode au &s;ervice de ces gueux l&agrave;; mais, pour moi, il ne me conviens pas du tout du tout:"</HI> &mdash;"On my word, that Mr. Guillotine is a mighty convenient gentleman
<PB N="379" REF="447">in the cau&s;e of tho&s;e beggarly patriots: ne|verthele&s;s, it is not at all to my ta&s;te." In &s;hort, my friend, if the immediate circum|&s;tances of the pre&s;ent moment are not ab&s;o|lutely threatening; if good company, good wine, gay conver&s;ation, or any other plea|&s;ant object of the &s;en&s;es, are within the reach, or in the view of the&s;e beings, the pa&s;t and future are forgotten. This is not, I am now convinced, what is generally thought, and as I my&s;elf once &s;uppo&s;ed, the effect of little &s;en|&s;ibility, of much levity, and a total want of &s;olid reflection, but proceeds, in great mea|&s;ure, as I have before ob&s;erved, from con&s;ti|tutional felicity. Yet you are too well &s;killed in the equal laws of nature and providence, to infer from hence, that the French are, from this bias, more ble&s;&s;ed than the re&s;t of man|kind. If they annihilate all that is gone by, and all that may come, when the "Cynthia of the minute" &s;miles before them, they &s;uffer with a bitterne&s;s of de&s;pondence, peculiar to them&s;elves, all that <HI>has</HI> afflicted them, or that <HI>may</HI> afflict, when the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> is but a continuation of their gloom. They then collect all the di&s;|a&s;trous parts of time into one point of mi&s;ery. The pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future &s;eem, through this focus, but as one ma&s;s, accumulated like

In the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and German minds, I think it is different. Amid&s;t the thicke&s;t glooms of their condition, whatever be their degrees of natural feeling, they bear the heavy <HI>collection</HI> of grief with more equanimity. Either their minds are &s;tronger, or their &s;en&s;ibility weaker; and be&s;ides, education, climate, and habits may contribute; but it brings into equipoi&s;e the allotments of heaven, and the di&s;pen&s;ations of nature, who&s;e &s;y&s;tem is, per|haps, the only po&s;&s;ible one in which equality can &s;ub&s;i&s;t&mdash;the equality of human happine&s;s; &s;ince &s;he has made, with very few exceptions, almo&s;t all her children (though not partakers of the &s;ame felicity, proceeding from the &s;ame cau&s;es) nearly the &s;ame in effects. To bring this matter home, to the &s;cene I have been relating, had the&s;e pa&s;&s;engers been un|moved in the degree that a Dutch family felt them&s;elves (the males &s;moking, and the fe|males &s;nuffing all the time upon deck) they would have &s;uffered le&s;s panic at the time of clearing the &s;hip, and, by the &s;ame rule, they would have enjoyed le&s;s when the danger was over.

<P>During one of my former Gleanings, at this Brielle-home, as I u&s;ed to call it, on account of the apartment always &s;acred to my returns, happened the annual vi&s;itation of the Prince Stadtholder, who yearly makes a tour of the States, to in&s;pect his garri&s;ons, and to review his &s;oldiers. Although of an athletic, and &s;omewhat drop&s;ical form, and of a heavy appearance, which, indeed, is u&s;ually attached thereto, the mind of this prince is active; and notwith&s;tanding a con&s;titutional weakne&s;s
<PB N="389" REF="457">in his knees, he is &s;aid to be capable of endur|ing incredible fatigue. Well is it, that he is &s;o, for &s;ome trying ones happened to him on the day above-mentioned: the bu&s;ine&s;s of which included an examination of the forces of the Republic, both at the Brielle and Helveot&s;luice. He arrived at the former about eight in the morning, from his re&s;i|dence at the Hague, which is a di&s;tance of four leagues. Every body expected him in their be&s;t dre&s;&s;es, and, (for that day, at lea&s;t) in their be&s;t looks, the &s;treets were lined with town militia, under arms; and the many-coloured flags of different &s;tates, were waving over the canals, and I do verily think more than two hundred were hoi&s;ted on Poles at the doors of the Burghers: every &s;treet, every avenue, every window, was crouded with the &s;ons, and, in yet greater numbers, with the daughters of curio&s;ity, who&s;e family is to be found, you know, in all countries, and I do a&s;&s;ure you, as many of its branches are re&s;ident amid&s;t the&s;e torpid Dutch dikes, and &s;tanding pools, as near more rapid waters. In his way to the Brielle his highne&s;s had two &s;mall arms of the Mae&s;e to pa&s;s, but he was no &s;ooner de&s;cried on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the fir&s;t, than the u&s;ual demon&s;trations of joy, real or coun|terfeit,
<PB N="390" REF="458">began: cannon were fired from the ramparts, and all the bells, of all the churches, were in tune, to greet him right loyally, before his per&s;on <HI>could be &s;een.</HI> At length appeared his barge, which, by the bye, was mo&s;t curiou&s;ly bepainted and begilt: there was given a general &s;alute of the military (I mean of the regulars) in garri&s;on: to this &s;ucceeded an <HI>apparently</HI> univer&s;al huzza of the people. I particularly remarked one man, who had the &s;ame morning been pointed out to me as "<HI>horriblement patriot,"</HI> who waved his hat higher, and &s;ent forth the voice of gratulation, louder than the re&s;t: but it is the nature of every &s;ort of hypo|cri&s;y to overact its part, and frequently to betray what it <HI>is,</HI> by the very attempt of appearing what it is <HI>not.</HI></P>

It was not Cleopatra meeting Mark Anthony, when &s;he &s;ailed down the Cydnos, in the bark which Shake&s;peare has made immortal; but it was, perhaps, a much better prince, and cer|tainly a much better man, than that Roman, coming to &s;ee that his bulwarks, and their heroes were in a fit &s;tate to defend his &s;ubjects, &s;hould defence be nece&s;&s;ary: as you know, mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary it was, but too &s;oon.</P>

<PB N="392" REF="460">which he did with the mo&s;t magnanimous compo&s;ure, &s;haking the "big, round drops," from his yet rounder face, and &s;acred ears!</P>
<P>In the like re&s;igned way, he &s;et off, brea&s;ting the hurricane, which, in&s;tead of yielding to his patience, made head again&s;t him more violently. He ran the military gauntlet of courte&s;y through all the principal &s;treets, and from thence, to a meadow at the di&s;tance of a mile, where tents were pitched to receive him. I have a very great objection to take long walks in the rain, albeit of a rambling di&s;po|&s;ition; but I made it matter of con&s;cience to expo&s;e my&s;elf to a good wetting on this great occa&s;ion. You would not gue&s;s the grandeur of my &s;oul, in &s;uch a trying hour, were I not to tell you, on the faith of an hi&s;torian, that, although I was armed with an umbrella, I never &s;pread it over my head; by which emulative action, I reduced my&s;elf to the &s;ituation of the prince him&s;elf, except that I had &s;till the ad|vantage of him in the article of the head, upon which I retained my hat, thus gaining in com|fort what I lo&s;t in glory. Indeed, I repented that I had carried the imitation of my &s;uperiors to the other parts of my body, &s;eeing that my apothecary's bill, (the con&s;equence of taking
<PB N="393" REF="461">cold) was neither paid by the States-General, nor the Stadtholder, as in the ca&s;e of the mili|tary, who&s;e pay goes on when they are placed on the &s;ick li&s;t; e&s;pecially, if they become inva|lids, by doing duty: for me, I did not get a &s;ingle &s;tiver to purcha&s;e &s;ugar-candy! and my cold co&s;t me, in that article, and others, the gro&s;s &s;um of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Five &s;hillings.</NOTE> three guilders! But I have purcha&s;ed a cure for my cough, and my am|bition at the &s;ame time; and were great men to &s;wim up to their necks, and little men to follow their example, I &s;hall never more be among&s;t their competitors; being inveterately fixed not to wet my &s;lipper any more, for the &s;ake of ambition: though for that of humanity, I hope I &s;hall ever continue to venture far be|yond my depth, into the mo&s;t <HI>troubled</HI> waters. Many of the officers, among&s;t whom were &s;e|veral pretty fellows, looked as if they would have been glad to take &s;helter in the tents till the hurricane was over; but the Prince re&s;ol|ved heroically to go through the morning bu&s;i|ne&s;s fir&s;t, and da&s;hed through all the manoeuvres with the di&s;po&s;itions of a duck; all his &s;oldiers following his example of cour&s;e; though evi|dently with &s;omewhat of the reluctance of a brood of chickens, unnaturally fathered, or
<PB N="394" REF="462">rather mothered upon the &s;aid duck. Pre&s;ently the air cleared, the &s;un broke out, and the weather became more favourable to the manoeuvres, which were very adroitly per|formed, and gave great &s;atisfaction to the Prince, who was indefatigable in his attention and attendance. He did not fini&s;h at the Brielle till near three in the afternoon: it mu&s;t have been near five before he got to Helveot|fluice, and probably midnight ere he regained his palace. Such are the taxes which govern|ments levy upon the governors; and I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, but that this chief mili|tary commander of the Republic, laid his deluged head that night upon the pillow, heartily weary of pre-eminence, and awoke to the con&s;oling thought that he &s;hould not be condemned to pay &s;o dear a price for a few huzzas, till that time twelve-months.</P>
<P>My friend, men are in the habit of calling kings and emperors tyrants, when mo&s;t of them, at lea&s;t, now a-days, are inve&s;ted with a kind of impotent dignity, and are in a &s;tate of more ince&s;&s;ant &s;lavery, than the meane&s;t &s;ubject of their realms; yet are often envied for tho&s;e &s;plendid vapours, which are but the &s;hin|ing chains and trappings of that very &s;lavery

<HEAD>LETTER III. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE cu&s;tom of marriages, and bu|rials are &s;ingular. Re&s;pecting the fir&s;t, the parties, if of the middling rank, are dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of &s;ables on the nuptial day, either to indicate the &s;olemnity of the bond, or as a <HI>memento mori,</HI> that all hope of conque&s;t &s;hould then be dead and buried, at the foot of the altar.</P>
<P>Funerals are no le&s;s remarkable. A nume|rous body of the burghers, in black gowns, and decent bands, attend the body of every de|cea&s;ed citizen. The prie&s;ts, pa&s;tors, &amp;c. vi&s;it the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed, which, even as if it was wholly evacuated, is &s;hut up, and that with mo&s;t jealous caution, till the morning of the burial; the corp&s;e is brought out by twelve burghers, and carried by them, not on &s;houlders, but by hand, to the grave, where it is depo&s;ited without any prayer whatever, though occa|&s;ionally a &s;ermon is preached. The mourners
<PB N="397" REF="465">look into the yawning earth, that is to hold their relation, or friend, and then depart. They take off the&s;e "&s;eemings of &s;orrow;" or more properly &s;peaking, "the cu&s;tomary &s;uits of common black," and mix in the bu&s;ine&s;s, or diver&s;ions of the world.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the advantages of a re&s;identiary or a deliberate traveller, who &s;tays in a place long enough, or vi&s;its it often enough to Glean its produce, whether natural or accidental, are tho&s;e chances, which throw you into the path of brother wanderers, whether preparing to take the field, or returning home with the har|ve&s;t of ob&s;ervation, from the different quarters of this wide world of enterprize. Several of the&s;e, the Chapter of Accidents, has already pre&s;ented: &s;ome laden with wheat, others only with chaff; many with flowers, and many with weeds; and not a few again, with a mixture of all the&s;e: according to the con&s;titution of Nature, which is compounded of good, bad, and indifferent.</P>
<P>During one of my re&s;idences, alternately at the Hague and the Brielle, I encountered two travellers of very oppo&s;ite powers, making as oppo&s;ite impre&s;&s;ions. The one, whom by way
<PB N="398" REF="466">of characteri&s;tic, I &s;hall call Mr. Blank, is of that order of travellers, who give to every airy unimportance, an inflated grandeur, and de|&s;cribe every trifle with a pomp of words ap|propriate only to that herol-comic burle&s;que, or fal&s;e &s;ublime, which would very well be|come the mice and the frogs in the old &s;able. I &s;oon perceived this &s;elf imagined mountain was always in labour, and brought forth no|thing but &s;ome of the above-named animals; yet, that they were u&s;hered into the world with all the pageantries of ea&s;tern phra&s;eology; as ridiculous and unnece&s;&s;ary as it would be to let off a cannon at a gnat, which might more ea&s;ily be exterminated by a fillip of the finger. This Mr. Blank, (&s;o let me call one of them) has travelled the Lord knows where, and is going, I believe, in my con&s;cience, the Lord knows <HI>not</HI> whither; for he talks of traver&s;ing regions, where human enterprize has never yet directed it&s;elf; of <HI>terrae incognitae,</HI> of which human beings have no preci&s;e ideas of exi&s;tence, but which <HI>be</HI> is &s;ure do exi&s;t, and which it is re|&s;erved for him, and him <HI>alone,</HI> to explore. Ah, bli&s;sful vanity! that can thus amu&s;e thy&s;elf with the &s;hining vapours of thy own &s;elf-love, and thus give
<Q><L>"To airy <HI>nothing,</HI></L>
<L>"A local habitation."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="467">This Mr. Blank travels with his works in his portmanteau; enters an inn, calls for pen and ink, in a violent hurry, to write down his la&s;t thoughts, &s;cribbles at full &s;peed, and notes,
<Q>"Ju&s;t ere it fall, the Cynthia of the minute."</Q> &mdash;He joins the public dining table&mdash;introduces <HI>him&s;elf</HI>&mdash;and, (what he conceives to be the be&s;t part of him) his works, to the company&mdash; <HI>forces</HI> his right and left hand neighbour to be his auditors&mdash;puts <HI>one</HI> mor&s;el of meat into his mouth, and &s;ends out two of pro&s;e or poe&s;y, (to his conceit far more reli&s;hing)&mdash;while the fir&s;t cour&s;e is removing he takes care to fill up the interval with the riche&s;t <HI>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">remet</HI>&mdash;he &s;erves <HI>him&s;elf up again</HI>&mdash;begs the company to hear, or read, &s;ome favourite pa&s;&s;age, which has been admired, copied, and got by heart in every court of Europe; rehear&s;ed by minor emperors, and &s;pouted by queens Dowager! but, in the mid&s;t of reading, being &s;eized with a new idea, he &s;tarts up regardle&s;s of his own appetite, but happily leaving you to the en|joyment of your's, runs out of the room, or to the &s;ide-board, or makes a table of his plate turned top&s;y-turvy, and has &s;crawled half a &s;heet of paper before you can help your&s;elf to a gla&s;s of wine; for, never, &s;urely, did mortal
<PB N="400" REF="468">author produce &s;uch "an infinite deal of nothing," in &s;o little time; and he <HI>talks</HI> non|&s;en&s;e as fa&s;t as he <HI>writes</HI> it. Happy powers! but, beware! during his &s;cribbling moments, make, on your part, the be&s;t u&s;e of them, or your dinner will be again in danger. Our author returns to cram you with food that will add little to your nouri&s;hment; and, unle&s;s you prefer his windy banquet to good animal &s;u&s;tenance, I &s;ee no e&s;cape but hunger and flight from a well-filled table; unle&s;s you fol|low the example of a plea&s;ant gentleman, who, knowing the di&s;po&s;ition of our traveller, de|clared him&s;elf, <HI>deaf and blind;</HI> regretting, at the &s;ame time, in the polite&s;t terms, (on a &s;lip of paper he &s;crawled in a written hint he had received) that he was <HI>thus</HI> prevented the honour and advantage of either reading or li&s;tening to his compo&s;itions. Do not, however, &s;uppo&s;e that a traveller who has encountered &s;o many more difficulties than Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, or Mr. Bruce, is to be di&s;mayed by a few natural im|pediments in any of his auditory: he goes on reciting, with the mo&s;t per&s;evering vehemence; and, as in the above in&s;tance, he fatigues you out of your well-di&s;&s;embled deafne&s;s, he wearies you out of every <HI>other</HI> a&s;&s;umed misfortune, by making you, at lea&s;t, confe&s;s, that though you
<PB N="401" REF="469"><HI>have</HI> eyes you <HI>will not &s;ee,</HI> and though you have ears, you <HI>will not hear.</HI> Thus, you mu&s;t either &s;acrifice your appetite to your politene&s;s, or your politene&s;s to your appetite. Mr. Blank has written de&s;criptions of countries, through which he has never pa&s;&s;ed; held di&s;cour&s;es with the innabitants, who never had habita|tion, having fir&s;t invented, and then conver&s;ed with them; painted &s;ufferings, with which it has not yet plea&s;ed the ju&s;tice of God to re|ward his fal&s;ehood, and incurred many hair|breadth e&s;capes, without his ever having been in danger.</P>
<P>As it is, however, well ob&s;erved, that "no|thing can come of nothing," I &s;hall ha&s;ten to repay you for having made &s;o "much ado" about it by the introduction of another travel|ler, who will make his <HI>entr&egrave;</HI> under every cir|cum&s;tance that can contra&s;t him to Mr. Blank, and whom, therefore, I &s;hall call Mr. Prize, This gentleman comes recommended to your friend&s;hip by all the advantages of good &s;en&s;e, heroi&s;m, mode&s;ty, and misfortune. Mr. Prize is one of the few who was &s;hipwrecked in the South Seas in the Pandora frigate, and he has been pre&s;erved from the general cru&s;h of his
<PB N="402" REF="470">fellow creatures, by encountering difficulties, from the furmounting which, the re&s;idue of his life &s;eems <HI>entitled</HI> to every honour and comfort his country can be&s;tow. But, as in various other ca&s;es, &s;o in this, his misfortunes have been pro|ductive of many intere&s;ting adventures among&s;t a people, concerning whom public curio&s;ity has been &s;o much indebted to the immortal Cap|tain Cooke. Mr. Prize, with equal mode&s;ty and force, related &s;uch a variety of anecdotes, re&s;pecting the inhabitants of Otaheite, that I pa&s;&s;ed from town to town in the public boats, without perceiving the di&s;tances, except to re|gret the &s;tops in the narrative, while we changed our barges, though this, at other times, is a not unwelcome interruption. I was earne&s;t with him to extend the plea&s;ure he had given me, by publi&s;hing his account as a &s;upplement to Cooke. The mode&s;ty with which he declined this, "becau&s;e the ta&s;k had been already better performed," was in perfect contra&s;t to the literary, or rather the illiterate, arrogance with which Mr. Blank had, the day before, roundly a&s;&s;erted, in my hearing, that
<Q>if he was ever again tempted to gratify the curio&s;ity of an ungrateful world, it &s;hould be well paid for;</Q> becau&s;e, added the vain|glorious boa&s;ter,
<Q>I cannot afford to throw
<PB N="403" REF="471">away my time and talents on a work, which, by annihilating all other travellers in the like route, be&s;ides the traver&s;e of unknown realms, will throw a new light and lu&s;tre upon hi&s;tory!</Q></P>
<P>Nothing &s;hort of the plea&s;ure one derives from the unaffected diffidence of a Mr. Prize, adorned with all the blu&s;hing powers of me|rit, (and of genius, uncon&s;cious of tho&s;e powers) could atone for the di&s;gu&s;ting pain one &s;uffers from the &s;welling conceit of a Mr. Blank, who, with the proude&s;t opinions, coupled the mo&s;t impotent abilities; for, as the relation of Mr. Prize was given in the &s;imple&s;t dre&s;s of Truth and Wi&s;dom, &s;o was that of Mr. Blank tricked off in all the meretricious ornaments of abortive labour, panting after the eloquence it could not reach.</P>
<P>Indeed I never, but in one &s;ingle in&s;tance, knew uncommon talents united with undom|mon vanity, and that one exception pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view the very next day after I had been regaled by the &s;ociety of Mr. Prize.</P>
<P>That you may have the&s;e three extraordinary characters brought as clo&s;e together upon pa|per,
<PB N="404" REF="472">as they were in life, you &s;hall now have a gleaning of this third traveller, whom, if you plea&s;e, we will di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of Blank and Prize!</P>
<P>Mr. Blank-and-Prize is a Swi&s;s officer of di&s;tinction in the &s;ervice of the Prince of Orange. He unites the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier, and the manners of a gentleman, to the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of a man of real genius. That genius, indeed, like many of his natal mountains in Switzerland, are &s;ublime without &s;terility; they flower to the very &s;ummits; and, like his natal vallies, are rich and picture&s;que, and "fling their fragrance" into the very bottom of the deepe&s;t glens. He was introduced to me by a party of familiar friends, who take plea|&s;ure in obliging me; but having &s;o lately &s;uf|fered from the obtru&s;ions of Mr. Blank, I did not expect a &s;imilar reparation to that which I had found in Mr. Prize. The fir&s;t appearance of the man, however, was menacing. He had not been announced a minute ere he was at the heels of his announcer. I was introduced to him as a traveller, a man of letters, and an Engli&s;hman. "I have a re&s;pect for all tho&s;e characters," replied Mr. Blank-and-Prize:
<Q>I make my bow to them, even when I meet
<PB N="405" REF="473">with them &s;eparately, but when I &s;ee them combining before me in a &s;ingle character, and concentrating in one per&s;on, as I under|&s;tand is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, I open my arms to receive him in this manner!</Q> (embracing.)</P>
<P>Here he expanded him&s;elf, pulled me into his embraces, and gave me the hug of literary brotherhood.
<Q>I am my&s;elf a traveller, a man of letters, and, though not an Engli&s;hman, &s;peak the language, as you perceive, as per|fectly as the be&s;t educated native,</Q> conti|nued Mr. Blank-and-Prize. <Q>I have traver&s;ed three parts of the earth, and am &s;oon to &s;et off for a tour of the other quarter. I am by birth a Switzer, glory in my country, and hope and believe it will <HI>glory in me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As he pronounced this, a private of our author's regiment, came in with a box of no incon&s;iderable &s;ize, under his arm; he placed it at his commanding officer's feet, and making the <HI>bow military,</HI> marched off in a drill &s;tep.</P>
<P><Q>Aye, here are &s;ome of my works; a &s;hort <HI>&s;pecimen,</HI></Q> &s;ir, &s;aid he." He took out the "key. I trembled. He threw open the lid, "and brought forth as many folio &s;heets of
<PB N="406" REF="474">paper, very clo&s;ely penned, as he could gra&s;p. With a no le&s;s determined hand, he hurried out a &s;econd, and then a third bundle, threat|ening <HI>&s;uch</HI> an attack upon my patience and politene&s;s, as my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and often &s;uffering, nature, almo&s;t &s;unk under: and yet I would go (and have many a time gone) very far <HI>indeed</HI> to let every man and woman have their humour.</P>
<P>The weather was extremely hot, and ill|adapted to any very &s;evere trials of attention. I had ever an aver&s;ion to that cla&s;s of authors, who are <HI>addicted</HI> to read their own works; and to be hedged into an enclo&s;ure, where there is no room for any body <HI>but</HI> the author to move a foot, or a finger (perhaps for &s;everal hours together) to the de&s;truction of my dear &s;un|&s;etting ramble, or twilight &s;tolen vi&s;it to na|ture, or the moon, with whom I have, you know, nightly a&s;&s;ignations. Did not all this threaten too much? Had there been but a loop-hole left for apology, I would have crept out at it. But the meeting was concerted by my friends, on purpo&s;e <HI>pour me faire plai&s;ir,</HI> purely to oblige me. Martyrdom, thought I!</P>
<P>Having rapidly turned over about an hun|dred leaves, Mr. Blank-and-Prize &s;aid <HI>(&s;till
<PB N="407" REF="475">turning)</HI>
<Q>I &s;ee you are impatient for me to begin. I will not keep you on the rack much longer. Come then, come, I will have mercy on you. You &s;hall have a little of my account of Switzerland fir&s;t, then we will trip acro&s;s the &s;eas to America, and then I will bring you back to Europe; after which, if we have time, you &s;hall in&s;pect my book of maps and drawings. Let me &s;ee, we have &s;ix hours good, and if I find you deeply in|tere&s;ted (as I am &s;ure you will be) I will &s;train a point to pa&s;s the whole evening at this hou&s;e (where I am always at home), and where, though I read my works twenty times, they wi&s;h for them twenty more.</Q></P>
<P>Gue&s;s my &s;ituation! A cat pent up in a corner never meditated more fell de&s;igns. I could have &s;topp'd his cruel lips by cramming his own works <HI>down his throat!</HI> A &s;oliloquy broke out in &s;omething betwixt a grumble and a &s;igh. How! am I condemned to <HI>hear</HI> down the &s;ummer's day and night, and make the tour of Europe and America, chained down to this chair! in &s;uch a day as this!</P>
<P>Our hi&s;torian began. I anticipated periods of a mile, and yawnings of a league. I was
<PB N="408" REF="476">mi&s;taken: not only the genuine matter of the compo&s;itions, but the manner in which they were delivered were treats. Albeit I do not boa&s;t much of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;aturnine, or phlegmatic characteri&s;tic of my countrymen, and have po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffered not a little from in|dulging the bias of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition, I do a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>my</HI> mo&s;t headlong &s;allies (even when they have driven me from a plain path, and open country into the entanglements of an untrodden wood, in the which, friend and reader, thou ha&s;t often &s;een me involved) might be deemed cold-hearted apathy to the deport|ment of our literary hero, while in the act of reading his manu&s;cripts!</P>
<P>He fir&s;t took me into Switzerland, and had he kept me there till now, amid&s;t the &s;cenery with which his pen and pencil brought me acquainted, I &s;hould have looked on my&s;elf as a very happy mountaineer, and him as a de|lightful guide! It is as impo&s;&s;ible to read his book without wi&s;hing to vi&s;it his country, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power to feel, and to de|&s;cribe its beauties, with the &s;ame force, as to view the exqui&s;ite and magic &s;cenery of De Loutherbourg.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="477">I cannot repeat the name of the la&s;t-men|tioned gentleman, without &s;ub&s;cribing fully to your eulogium on his talents. He paints to the &s;oul. "The cloud-capt hill," the pro|found valley, the &s;carce-heard rill, the deaf|ning cataract, the proude&s;t &s;ublimities, and all the intere&s;ting minutiae of nature, in her la|bours, in her pa&s;times, in her awful opera|tions, and in her &s;ports, are before you. <HI>He places you on the &s;pots de&s;cribed.</HI> His pencil carries you where its owner plea&s;es; you con|ver&s;e with the per&s;ons; you lo&s;e &s;ight of the painter: you forget he is &s;itting in a chair be|&s;ide you, or even de&s;cribing to you the &s;tory of his piece. He is lo&s;t in the &s;cene he has painted: the objects he groupes, the &s;tory he tells, are in your heart. He per&s;onifies ima|ginary, and annihilates actual beings. In &s;hort, he intere&s;ts you &s;o much for the ab&s;ent, that you neglect or overlook the pre&s;ent. For him|&s;elf, he is frequently out of &s;ight; and we have eyes and ears only for the places and per&s;onages with whom he has brought us acquainted: but when the charm on the canva&s;s is di&s;&s;olved, and De Loutherbourg comes again into view, you recollect that he is not only one of the be&s;t painters, but one of the worthie&s;t men in the world. This combines love of the man with
<PB N="410" REF="478">admiration of the arti&s;t, and your &s;atisfaction is complete.</P>
<P>By a retrograde motion, I &s;hall now conduct you back to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> field of our ob&s;ervation in Holland, (Helvoet&s;luice) in order to carry you progre&s;&s;ively to the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> to the advantage of your pur&s;e, the ea&s;e of your per&s;on, and the amu&s;ement of your mind.</P>
<P>I &s;hould apologi&s;e for the&s;e Gleanings being &s;omewhat out of place, had it not been &s;ettled, in a compact of corre&s;pondence, between us, to take what freedoms I plea&s;ed, with time, and circum&s;tance; to carry you backwards and forwards as &s;eemed be&s;t unto me, taking care to arrange the whole, amid&s;t this "regular confu&s;ion," <HI>&s;o</HI> as to give you the greate&s;t va|riety of entertainment, and information.</P>
