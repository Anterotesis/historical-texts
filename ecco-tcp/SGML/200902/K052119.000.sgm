<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely &s;orry that I am oblig'd, like your evil genius, to meet you with ill news on your arrival; but all the con&s;olation I can afford my dear friend, is an a&s;&s;urance of my &s;i&s;ter's con&s;tancy&mdash;To keep you no longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e&mdash;my father has promis'd her hand to Sir <HI>Geofry Ginkle</HI>&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, <HI>Delamour,</HI> I am no object to be envied, and far from having an a&s;&s;urance of <HI>Florimel's</HI> affections; happy, then, indeed &s;hould I be; but &s;he is &s;till the &s;ame gay, unthink|ing, lovely, witty rogue; if in the mo&s;t un|feign'd rapture I breathe my love, the return is a loud laugh, an opera tune, or a ridiculous &s;imile, which, faith, &s;ometimes makes me look very &s;illy; indeed, in her more &s;erious moments, which are but few, &s;he, perhaps, gives me an hearing, when all at once a crowd of gayer thoughts ru&s;h on, and kill at once the hopes wherewith I was elated a few minutes before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall find me a powerful advocate in your cau&s;e, but excu&s;e me for deviating from the maxims of our modern profe&s;&s;ors of the law; my proceedings in your favour, will not be
<PB N="4" REF="6">
wholly di&s;intere&s;ted; you mu&s;t give me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in your power, to break the mea&s;ures of your father and Sir <HI>Geofry;</HI> but how &s;uch a notion enter'd into his doating brain, is to me amazing. I've often heard him expre&s;s the ut|mo&s;t abhorrence to matrimony; but then, when I reflect upon my <HI>Emily</HI>'s beauty, I can't wonder at his being caught; old goat&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Love is far from being the &s;ole motive of Sir <HI>Geofry</HI>'s addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Emily;</HI> the vain hopes of having an heir of his own beget|ting, to inherit his e&s;tate, (which, you know, is con&s;iderable,) and to mortify his nephew; the&s;e are the &s;purs which prick him on, in the road which has hitherto appear'd &s;o dreadful to him. I dare &s;ay, you know this nephew; as Sir <HI>Geofry</HI> had no children of his own, and intended never to marry, he bred him up under his own care, placed his chief felicity in having him receive tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments, proper for a per&s;on, who (as he was to inherit Sir <HI>Geofry</HI>'s e&s;tate after his decea&s;e) probably might make a figure in the great world; the&s;e accompli&s;hments, join'd to a natural fine genius, a graceful per&s;on, and a beneficent cour|teous di&s;po&s;ition, gain'd him the e&s;teem of all who knew him&mdash;He was the darling of his uncle. But in this happy &s;tate, he, following the dic|tates of love before tho&s;e of his intere&s;t, un|known to his uncle, e&s;pous'd a young lady who&s;e only want was a fortune &s;ufficient to ren|der
<PB N="5" REF="7">
her a match &s;uitable for the heir of Sir <HI>Geofry.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word I commend his notion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Wood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This imprudence of the young gentleman &s;o exa&s;perated the old knight, that, when he heard of it, he &s;wore he &s;hould never be a &s;hilling the better for him; refus'd to &s;ee him; and now this unfortunate couple are oblig'd to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon a &s;mall patrimony, left him by his father, in a remote part of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Del.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your account, I really pity them, and wi&s;h with my &s;oul, for their &s;ake as well as my own, the current of his affections cou'd be turn'd to its former channel.</P>

<P>He's &s;o fix'd on the completion of this marriage, that, to make &s;ure of my father's con&s;ent, he has offer'd to take <HI>Emily</HI> without a portion; there he touch'd the vein; my father, at fir&s;t, &s;hock'd at &s;uch an odd propo&s;ition, gave his old friend very little encouragement; but the mention of no fortune, together with Sir <HI>Geofry</HI>'s great e&s;tate, &s;tifled all parental tender|ne&s;s, and he now exerts all his authority, to
<PB N="6" REF="8">
oblige poor <HI>Emily</HI> to name the day, and, till then, to look upon Sir <HI>Geofry</HI> as a gentleman, whom his prudence has de&s;tin'd her for a hu&s;|band.

<P>Then, &s;ir, &s;ince your &s;agacity's not of a &s;ufficient length to reach the bottom, I mu&s;t give you a line to eke it out, and to right my innocent friend, who has &s;uffered &s;o much in your opinions. Now, Sir <HI>Geofry,</HI> and you, Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> look upon <HI>Emily</HI> in a different light than what you've lately done&mdash;She had a gal|lant, 'tis true, and here he &s;tands, in the cir|cumference of this &s;imple petticoat, to hinder a prepo&s;terous match between Sir <HI>Geofry</HI> and my dear <HI>Emily,</HI> which would render her inevitably mi&s;erable. I wrote you, Sir <HI>Geofry,</HI> that ano|nymous letter, to which you gave &s;o much credit; and in that &s;uit of cloaths, which now my brother wears, I per&s;onated your imaginary rival, dropt the billet of a&s;&s;ignation, which you found and &s;hew'd Sir <HI>Anthony.</HI> The&s;e ma|chinations of mine having had &s;uch happy ef|fects, and as my real motive for deceiving you both, proceeded from my eagerne&s;s to &s;erve my dear <HI>Emily,</HI>&mdash;I hope you'll both forgive me.</P>
