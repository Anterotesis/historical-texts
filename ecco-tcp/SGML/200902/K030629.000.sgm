<HEAD>BETTY BROWN, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BETTY Brown, the Orange Girl, was born no|body knows where, and bred nobody knows how. No girl in all the &s;treets of London could drive a barrow more nimbly, avoid pu&s;hing again&s;t pa&s;&s;engers more dexterou&s;ly, or cry her "Fine China Oranges" in a &s;hriller voice. But then &s;he could neither &s;ow, nor &s;pin, nor knit, nor wa&s;h nor iron, nor read, nor &s;pell. Betty had not been always in &s;o good a &s;ituation as that in which we now de&s;cribe her. She came into the world before &s;o many good gentlemen and ladies began to con|cern them&s;elves &s;o kindly that the poor might have a little learning. There was no charitable Society then, as there is now, to pick up poor friendle&s;s children in the &s;treets, and put them into a good hou&s;e, and give them meat, and drink, and lodg|ing, and learning, and teach them to get their bread in an hone&s;t way into the bargain. Whereas, this now is often the ca&s;e in London, ble&s;&s;ed be God for all his mercies.</P>
<P>The longe&s;t thing that Betty can remember is, that &s;he u&s;ed to crawl up out of a night cellar, &s;troll about the &s;treets, and pick cinders from the &s;cavengers carts. Among the a&s;hes &s;he &s;ometimes found &s;ome ragged gauze and dirty ribbons; with
<PB N="4" REF="3">
the&s;e &s;he u&s;ed to dizen her&s;elf out, and join the merry bands on the fir&s;t of May. This was not however quite fair, as &s;he did not lawfully belong ei|ther to the female dancers who foot it gaily round the garland, or to the &s;ooty tribe, who, on this happy holiday, forget their whole year's toil; &s;he often, however, got a few &s;craps, by appearing to belong to both parties.</P>
<P>Betty was not an idle girl; &s;he always put her&s;elf in the way of doing &s;omething. She would run of errands for the footmen, or &s;weep the door for the maid of any hou&s;e where &s;he was known; &s;he would run and fetch &s;ome porter, and never was once known either to &s;ip a drop or &s;teal the pot. Her quickne&s;s and fidelity in doing little jobs, got her into favour with a lazy cook-maid, who was too apt to give away her ma&s;ter's cold meat and beer, not to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t in want, but to tho&s;e who waited upon her, and did the little things which &s;he ought to have done her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The cook, who found Betty a dextrous girl, &s;oon employed her to &s;ell ends of candles, pieces of meat and chee&s;e, and lumps of butter, or any thing el&s;e &s;he could crib from the hou&s;e. The&s;e were all carried to her friend Mrs. Sponge, who kept a little &s;hop, and a kind of eating-hou&s;e for poor working people, not far from the Seven Dials. She al&s;o bought as well as &s;old many kinds of &s;e|cond hand things, and was not &s;crupulous to know whether what &s;he bought was hone&s;tly come by, provided &s;he could get it for a &s;ixth part of what it was worth. But if the owner pre&s;umed to a&s;k for it's real value, &s;he had &s;udden qualms of con|&s;cience, &s;u&s;pected the things were &s;tolen, and gave her&s;elf airs of hone&s;ty, which often took in poor
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;illy people, and gave her a &s;ort of half-reputation among the needy and the ignorant, who&s;e friend &s;he pretended to be.</P>
<P>To this artful woman Betty carried the cook's pilferings, and as Mrs. Sponge would give no great price for the&s;e in money, the cook was willing to receive payment for her eatables in Mrs. Sponge's drinkables; for &s;he dealt in all kinds of &s;pirits. I &s;hall only ju&s;t remark here, that one receiver, like Mrs. Sponge, makes many pilferers, who are tempted to the&s;e petty thieveries, by knowing how ea&s;y it is to di&s;po&s;e of them at &s;uch iniquitous hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Betty was faithful to both her employers, which is extraordinary, con&s;idering the greatne&s;s of the temptation, and her utter ignorance of good and evil. One day, &s;he ventured to a&s;k Mrs. Sponge if &s;he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t her to get into a more &s;ettled way of life. She told her, that when &s;he ro&s;e in the morning, &s;he never knew where &s;he &s;hould lie at night, nor was &s;he ever &s;ure of a meal before|hand. Mrs. Sponge a&s;ked her what &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;it for. Betty, with fear and tremblings, &s;aid, there was one trade for which &s;he thought her&s;elf qualified, but &s;he had not the ambition to to look &s;o high. It was far above her humble views. This was, to have a barrow, and &s;ell fruit, as &s;e|veral other of Mrs. Sponge's cu&s;tomers did, whom &s;he had often looked at with envy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge was an artful woman. Bad as &s;he was, &s;he was always aiming at &s;omething of a character; this was a great help to her trade. While &s;he watched keenly to make every thing turn to her own profit, &s;he had a fal&s;e fawning way of &s;eeming to do all &s;he did out of pity and kindne&s;s to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and &s;he &s;eldom committed an extortion,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
but &s;he tried to make the per&s;on &s;he cheated be|lieve them&s;elves highly obliged to her kindne&s;s. By thus pretending to be their friend &s;he gained their confidence, and &s;he grew rich her&s;elf while they thought &s;he was only &s;hewing favour to them. Various were the arts &s;he had of getting rich. The money &s;he got by grinding the poor, &s;he &s;pent in the mo&s;t luxurious living; and, while &s;he would haggle with her hungry cu&s;tomers for a farthing, &s;he would &s;pend pounds on the mo&s;t co&s;tly delica|cies for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge, laying a&s;ide that haughty look and voice, well known to &s;uch as had the misfortune to be in her debt, put on the hypocritical &s;mile and &s;oft tone, which &s;he always a&s;&s;umed when &s;he meant to <HI>take in</HI> her dependents. "Betty," &s;aid &s;he, "I am re&s;olved to &s;tand your friend. The&s;e are &s;ad times to be &s;ure. Money is money now. Yet I am re&s;olved to put you into a hand&s;ome way of living. You &s;hall have a barrow, and well furni&s;hed too." Betty could not have felt more joy or gratitude, if &s;he had been told that &s;he &s;hould have a coach. "O, Madam," &s;aid Betty, "it is impo&s;&s;ible. I have not a penny in the world towards helping me to &s;et up." "I will take care of that," &s;aid Mrs. Sponge; "only you mu&s;t do as I bid you. You mu&s;t pay me intere&s;t for my money. And you will of cour&s;e be glad al&s;o to pay &s;o much every night for a nice hot &s;upper which I get ready, quite out of kind|ne&s;s, for a number of poor working people. This will be a great comfort for &s;uch a friendle&s;s girl as you, for my victuals and drink are the be&s;t; and and my company the merrie&s;t of any hou&s;e in all St. Giles's." Betty thought all this only &s;o many more favours, and court&s;eying to the ground, &s;aid,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
"to be &s;ure, Ma'am, and thank you a thou&s;and times into the bargain."</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge knew what &s;he was about. Betty was a lively girl, who had a knack at learning any thing; and &s;o well looking through all her dirt and rags, that there was little doubt &s;he would get cu&s;|tom. A barrow was &s;oon provided, and five &s;hil|lings put into Betty's hands. Mrs. Sponge kindly conde&s;cended to go to &s;hew her how to buy the fruit, for it was a rule with this prudent gentle|woman, and one from which &s;he never departed, that no one &s;hould cheat but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Betty had never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;um before. She grudged to lay it out all at once, and was ready to fancy &s;he could live upon the capital. The crown, however, was laid out to the be&s;t advan|tage. Betty was carefully taught in what manner to cry her Oranges; and received many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons how to get off the bad with the good, and the &s;tale with the fre&s;h. Mrs. Sponge al&s;o lent her a few bad &s;ixpences, for which &s;he ordered her to bring home good ones at night.&mdash;Betty &s;tared. Mrs. Sponge &s;aid, "Betty, tho&s;e who would get money, mu&s;t not be too nice about trifles. Keep one of the&s;e &s;ixpences in your hand, and if an ignorant young cu&s;tomer gives you a good &s;ixpence, do you im|mediately &s;lip it into your other hand, and give him the bad one, declaring, that it is the very one you have ju&s;t received, and that you have not an|other &s;ixpence in the world. You mu&s;t al&s;o learn how to treat different &s;orts of cu&s;tomers. To &s;ome you may put off with &s;afety goods which would be quite un&s;aleable to others. Never offer bad fruit, Betty, to tho&s;e who know better; never wa&s;te the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
good on tho&s;e who may be put off with wor&s;e; put good Oranges at top and the mouldy ones under."</P>
<P>Poor Betty had not a nice con&s;cience, for &s;he had never learnt that grand but &s;imple rule of all moral obligation, "Never do that to another which you would not have another do to you." She &s;et off with her barrow as proud and as happy as if &s;he had been &s;et up in the fine&s;t &s;hop in Covent Garden. Betty had a &s;ort of natural good-nature, which made her unwilling to impo&s;e, but &s;he had no principle which told her it was a &s;in. She had &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s, that, when night came, &s;he had not an Orange left. With a light heart, &s;he drove her empty barrow to Mrs. Sponge's door. She went in with a merry face, and threw down on the Counter every farthing &s;he had taken. "Betty," &s;aid Mrs. Sponge, "I have a right to it all, as it was got by my money. But I am too generous to take it. I will therefore only take &s;ixpence for this day's u&s;e of my five &s;hillings. This is a mo&s;t rea&s;onable intere&s;t, and I will lend you the &s;ame &s;um to trade with to-morrow, and &s;o on; you only paying me &s;ixpence for the u&s;e of it every night, which will be a great bargain to you. You mu&s;t al&s;o pay me my price every night for your &s;upper, and you &s;hall have an excellent lodging above &s;tairs; &s;o you &s;ee every thing will now be provided for you in a gen|teel manner, through my genero&s;ity."</P>
<P>Poor Betty's gratitude blinded her &s;o completely that &s;he forgot to calculate the va&s;t proportion which this generous benefactre&s;s was to receive out of her little gains. She thought her&s;elf a happy creature, and went in to &s;upper with a number of others of her own cla&s;s. For this &s;upper, and for more porter and gin than &s;he ought to have drank,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Betty was forced to pay &s;o high, that it eat up all the profits of the day, which, added to the daily intere&s;t, made Mrs. Sponge a rich return for her five &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Betty was reminded again of the gentility of her new &s;ituation, as &s;he crept up to bed in one of Mrs. Sponge's garrets five &s;tories high. This loft, to be &s;ure, was &s;mall, and had no window, but what it wanted in light was made up in company, as it had three beds, and thrice as many lodgers. Tho&s;e gentry had one night, in a drunken frolic, broke down the door, which happily had never been re|placed; for, &s;ince that time, the lodgers had died much &s;eldomer of infectious di&s;tempers. For this lodging Betty paid twice as much to her good friend as &s;he would have done to a &s;tranger. Thus &s;he continued, with great indu&s;try and a thriving trade, as poor as on the fir&s;t day, and not a bit nearer to &s;aving money enough to buy her even a pair of &s;hoes, though her feet were nearly on the ground.</P>
<P>One day, as Betty was driving her barrow through a &s;treet near Holborn, a lady from a window called out to her that he wanted &s;ome Oranges. While the &s;ervant went to fetch a plate, the lady entered into &s;ome talk with Betty, having been &s;truck with her hone&s;t countenance and civil manner. She que&s;tioned her as to her way of life, and the profits of her trade&mdash;and Betty, who had never been &s;o kindly treated before by &s;o genteel a per&s;on, was very communicative. She told her little hi&s;tory as far as &s;he knew it, and dwelt much on the genero|&s;ity of Mrs. Sponge, in keeping her in her hou&s;e, and tru&s;ting her with &s;o large a capital as five &s;hil|lings. At fir&s;t it &s;ounded like a very good-natured thing, but the lady, who&s;e hu&s;band was one of the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Ju&s;tices of the new Police, happened to know more of Mrs. Sponge than was good, which led her to inquire &s;till further. Betty owned, that to be &s;ure, it was not all clear profit, for that be&s;ides that the high price of the &s;upper and bed ran away with all &s;he got, &s;he paid &s;ixpence a day for the u&s;e of the five &s;hillings. "And how long have you done this, &s;aid the Lady?" "About a year, Madam."</P>
<P>The lady's eyes were at once opened. "My poor girl," &s;aid &s;he, "do you know that you have already paid for that &s;ingle five &s;hillings the enor|mous &s;um of 7l. 10s.? I believe it is the mo&s;t pro|fitable five &s;hillings Mrs. Sponge ever laid out." "O, no Madam," &s;aid the girl, "that good gen|tlewoman does the &s;ame kindne&s;s to ten or twelve other poor friendle&s;s creatures like me." "Does &s;he &s;o?" &s;aid the lady; "then I never heard of a better trade than this woman carries on, under the ma&s;k of charity, at the expence of her poor fellow-|creatures."</P>
<P>"But, Madam," &s;aid Betty, who did not com|prehend this lady's arithmetic, "what can I do? I now contrive to pick up a mor&s;el of bread with|out begging or &s;tealing. Mrs. Sponge has been very good to me, and I don't &s;ee how I can help my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I will tell you," &s;aid the lady. "If you will follow my advice, you may not only maintain your|&s;elf hone&s;tly, but independently. Only oblige your|&s;elf to live hard for a little time, till you have &s;aved five &s;hillings out of your own earnings. Give up that expen&s;ive &s;upper at night, drink only one pint of porter, and no gin at all. As &s;oon as you have &s;craped together the five &s;hillings, carry it back to your fal&s;e friend, and if you are indu&s;trious, you
<PB N="11" REF="10">
will at the end of the year have &s;aved &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings. If you can make a &s;hift to live now, when you have this heavy intere&s;t to pay, judge how things will mend when your capital becomes your own. You will put &s;ome cloaths on your back, and by leaving the u&s;e of &s;pirits, and the company in which you drink them, your health, your morals, and your condition will mend."</P>
<P>The lady did not talk thus to &s;ave her money. She would gladly have given the girl the five &s;hil|lings; but &s;he thought it was beginning at the wrong end. She wanted to try her. Be&s;ides, &s;he knew there was much more plea&s;ure as well as honour in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing five &s;hillings of one's own &s;av|ing than of another's giving. Betty promi&s;ed to obey. She owned &s;he got no good by the company or the liquor at Mrs. Sponge's. She promi&s;ed that very night to begin &s;aving the expence of the &s;up|per, and that &s;he would not ta&s;te a drop of gin till &s;he had the five &s;hillings beforehand. The lady, who knew the power of good habits, was contented with this, thinking, that if the girl could ab&s;tain for a certain time, it would become ea&s;y to her. She therefore at pre&s;ent &s;aid little about the <HI>&s;in</HI> of drinking.</P>
<P>In a very few weeks, Betty had &s;aved up the five &s;hillings. She went to carry back this money with great gratitude to Mrs. Sponge. This kind friend began to abu&s;e her mo&s;t unmercifully. She called her many hard names not fit to repeat, for having for&s;aken the &s;upper, by which &s;he &s;wore &s;he got nothing at all; but as &s;he had the charity to dre&s;s it for &s;uch beggarly wretches, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted they &s;hould pay for it, whether they eat it or not. She al&s;o brought in a heavy &s;core for lodging,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
though Betty had paid for it every night, and given notice of her intending to quit her. By all the&s;e fal&s;e pretences, &s;he got from her not only her own five &s;hillings, but all the little capital with which Betty was going to &s;et up for her&s;elf. As all was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer her demands, &s;he declared &s;he would &s;end her to pri&s;on, but while &s;he went to call a Con&s;table, Betty contrived to make off.</P>
<P>With a light pocket and a heavy heart, &s;he went to the lady, and with many tears told her &s;ad &s;tory. The lady's hu&s;band, the Ju&s;tice, conde|&s;cended to li&s;ten to Betty's tale. He &s;aid Mrs. Sponge had long been upon his books as a receiver of &s;tolen goods. Betty's evidence &s;trengthened his bad opinion of her. "This petty &s;y&s;tem of u&s;ury," &s;aid the gentleman, "may be thought trifling, but it will no longer appear &s;o, if you reflect, that if one of the&s;e female &s;harpers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a capital of &s;eventy &s;hillings, or 3l. 10l. with fourteen &s;teady regular cu&s;tomers, &s;he can realize a fixed income of 100 guineas a year. Add to this the influence &s;uch a loan gives her over the&s;e friendle&s;s crea|tures, by compelling them to eat at her hou&s;e, or lodge, or buy liquors, or by taking their pawns, and you will &s;ee the extent of the evil. I pity the&s;e poor victims: You, Betty, &s;hall point out &s;ome of them to me. I will endeavour to open their eyes on their own bad management. It is one of the greate&s;t acts of kindne&s;s to the poor to mend their oeconomy, and to give them right views of laying out their little money to advantage. The&s;e poor blinded creatures look no farther than to be able to pay this heavy intere&s;t every night, and to ob|tain the &s;ame loan on the &s;ame hard terms the next day. Thus are they kept in poverty and bondage
<PB N="13" REF="12">
all their lives; but I hope as many as hear of this will get on a better plan, and I &s;hall be ready to help any who are willing to help them&s;elves." This worthy Magi&s;trate went directly to Mrs. Sponge's with proper officers, and he got to the bottom of many iniquities. He not only made her refund poor Betty's money, but committed her to pri&s;on for receiving &s;tolen goods, and various other of|fences, which may perhaps make the &s;ubject of an|other hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Betty was now &s;et up in trade to her heart's con|tent. She had found the benefit of leaving off &s;pirits, and &s;he re&s;olved to drink them no more. The fir&s;t fruits of this re&s;olution was that in a fortnight &s;he bought her a new pair of &s;hoes, and as there was now no deduction for intere&s;t or for gin, her earnings became con&s;iderable. The lady made her a pre&s;ent of a gown and a hat, on the ea&s;y condition that &s;he &s;hould go to church. She accepted the terms, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t rather as an act of obedience to the lady, than from a &s;en&s;e of higher duty. But &s;he &s;oon began to go from a better motive. This con&s;tant attend|ance at church, joined to the in&s;tructions of the lady, opened a new world to Betty. She now heard for the fir&s;t time that &s;he was a &s;inner; that God had given a law which was holy, ju&s;t, and good, that &s;he had broken this law, had been a &s;wearer, a &s;abbath-breaker, and had lived without God in the world. All this was &s;ad news to Betty; &s;he knew, indeed, that there were &s;inners, but &s;he thought they were only to be found in the pri&s;ons, or at Botany Bay, or in tho&s;e mournful carts which &s;he had &s;ometimes followed with her barrow, with the unthinking croud to Tyburn.&mdash;She was mo&s;t &s;truck with the great truths revealed in the Scripture,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
which were quite new to her. She was de&s;irous of improvement, and &s;aid, &s;he would give up all the profits of her barrow, and go into the harde&s;t &s;ervice, rather than live in &s;in and ignorance.</P>
<P>"Betty," &s;aid the lady, "I am glad to &s;ee you &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, and will do what I can for you. Your pre&s;ent way of life, to be &s;ure, expo&s;es you to much danger; but the trade is not unlawful in it&s;elf, and we may plea&s;e God in any calling, pro|vided it be not a di&s;hone&s;t one. In this great town there mu&s;t be barrow-women to &s;ell fruit. Do you, then, in&s;tead of for&s;aking your bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;et a good example to tho&s;e in it, and &s;hew them, that though a dangerous trade, it need not be a bad one. Till Providence points out &s;ome &s;afer way of getting your bread, let your companions &s;ee, that it is po&s;&s;ible to be good even in this. Your trade being carried on in the open &s;treet, and your fruit bought in an open &s;hop, you are not &s;o much obliged to keep &s;inful company as may be thought. Take a garret in an hone&s;t hou&s;e, to which you may go home in &s;afety at night. I will give you a bed and a few nece&s;&s;aries to furni&s;h your room; and I will al&s;o give you a con&s;tant Sunday's dinner. A bar|row-woman, ble&s;&s;ed be God and our good laws, is as much her own mi&s;tre&s;s on Sundays as a Duche&s;s; and the Church and the Bible are as much open to her. You may &s;oon learn all that &s;uch as you are expected to know. A barrow-woman may pray as heartily morning and night, and &s;erve God as acceptably all day, while &s;he is carrying on her little trade, as if &s;he had her whole time to &s;pare.</P>

<P>To break the&s;e rules, will be your chief temp|tation. God will mark how you behave under them, and will reward or puni&s;h you accordingly. The&s;e temptations will be as great to you as higher trials are to higher people; but you have the &s;ame God to look to for &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t them as they have. You mu&s;t pray to him to give you this &s;trength. You &s;hall attend a Sunday School, where you will be taught the&s;e good things, and I will promote you as you &s;hall be found to de&s;erve.</P>
