<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE various <HI>Collections</HI> already publi&s;hed and adopted in &s;chools, might &s;eem to ren|der this &s;uperfluous; yet the Editor, unintimidat|ed by that reflection, ventures to offer this little <HI>Selection</HI> to the Public, with a full conviction, that judicious teachers will immediately per|ceive its obvious utility.&mdash;That excellent Collection of moral and in&s;tructive E&s;&s;ays, &amp;c. THE PLEASING INSTRUCTOR, and other popular books of a like kind, have become &s;o familiar in &s;chools, that they pall upon the mind, and boys are inclined to con&s;ider the reading of them as a kind of ta&s;k, and therefore di&s;regard the precepts they contain.&mdash;Since the time of their fir&s;t publication, many excellent authors have added &s;ufficiently to the &s;tock of modern litera|ture to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity for a Compilation that might combine the beauties contained in their works, with tho&s;e we find in Authors that have previou&s;ly been had recour&s;e to.</P>
<P>The Editor's chief purpo&s;e in making this &s;e|lection was, to inculcate in the minds of youth &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of their moral obligations, the danger of the &s;lighte&s;t deviation from the path of virtue, and tho&s;e refined &s;en&s;ibilities of the human mind, which elevate man &s;o infinitely beyond the re&s;t of the creation, and fit him for rational en|lightened &s;ociety.&mdash;The early cultivation of the virtuous, generous, and humane principles of the
<PB N="iv" REF="4">mind, is certainly a matter of the greate&s;t im|portance; therefore he who contributes to exalt and confirm tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, which adorn and ennoble human nature, may &s;urely e&s;cape cen|&s;ure, even if the &s;lightne&s;s of the means he adopts do not entitle him to any high degree of general approbation.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>On the</HI> CONDUCT <HI>of</HI> YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE &s;eems to be a peculiar propriety in addre&s;&s;ing moral precepts to the ri&s;ing generation. Be&s;ides that, like travellers entering on a journey, they want direction, there are circum&s;tances which render it probable, that in&s;truction will be more efficacious in youth than at a maturer period. Long habits of bu&s;i|ne&s;s or plea&s;ure, and an indi&s;criminate intercour&s;e with mankind, often &s;uperinduce a great degree of in&s;en&s;ibility; and the battered veteran at la&s;t con&s;iders the admonitions of the morali&s;t as the vain babbling of a &s;ophi&s;t, and the declamation of a &s;chool-boy. The keen edge of moral perception is blunted by long and reiterated colli&s;ion; and to him who has lo&s;t the finer &s;en&s;ibilities, it is no le&s;s fruitle&s;s to addre&s;s a moral di&s;cour&s;e, than to repre&s;ent to the deaf the charms of melody, or to the blind the beauties of a picture.</P>
<P>But youth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;en&s;ibility in perfection; and unle&s;s education has been totally neglected, or errone|ou&s;ly pur&s;ued, its habits are u&s;ually virtuous. Furni&s;h|ed with a natural &s;u&s;ceptibility, and free from any ac|quired impediment, the mind is then in the mo&s;t fa|vourable &s;tate for the admi&s;&s;ion of in&s;truction, and for learning how to live.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">I will then &s;uppo&s;e a young man pre&s;ent who has pa&s;&s;ed through the forms of a liberal education at &s;chool, and who is ju&s;t entering on the &s;tage of life, to act his part according to his own judgment. I will addre&s;s him with all the affection and &s;incerity of a parent, in the following manner:</P>
<Q><P>You have violent pa&s;&s;ions implanted in you by Nature for the accompli&s;hment of her purpo&s;es; but conclude not, as many have done to their ruin, that becau&s;e they are violent, they are irre&s;i&s;tible. The &s;ame Nature which gave you pa&s;&s;ions, gave you al&s;o rea&s;on and a love of order. Religion, added to the light of Nature and the experience of mankind, has concurred in e&s;tabli&s;hing it as an unque&s;tionable truth, that the irregular or intemperate indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ions is always attended with pain in &s;ome mode or other, which greatly exceeds its plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Your pa&s;&s;ions will be ea&s;ily re&s;trained from enor|mous exce&s;s, if you really with and hone&s;tly endea|vour to re&s;train them. But the greater part of young men &s;tudy to inflame their fury, and give them a degree of force which they po&s;&s;e&s;s not in a &s;tate of nature. They run into temptation, and de|&s;ire not to be delivered from evil They knowingly and willingly &s;acrifice, to momentary gratifications, the comfort of all which &s;hould &s;weeten the remain|der of life. Begin then with mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hing to conquer tho&s;e &s;ubtle and powerful enemies whom you carry in your bo&s;om. Pray for divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Avoid &s;olitude the fir&s;t moment a loo&s;e thought in&s;inuates it&s;elf, and ha&s;ten to the company of tho&s;e whom you re&s;pect. Conver&s;e not on &s;ubjects, which lead to impure ideas.</P>
<P>The perver&s;e ambition of arriving at the character of a man of &s;pirit by vicious audacity, has of rate univer&s;ally prevailed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s ruined the greater part of the Briti&s;h youth. I have known many young men proud of the impure&s;t of di&s;tempers, and boa&s;t|ing
<PB N="3" REF="11">of misfortunes which are attended with the greate&s;t pain and mi&s;ery, and ought to be accom|panied with &s;hame. Far more have taken pains to &s;hine, amid&s;t the little circle of their vicious ac|quaintance, in the character of gay libertines, than to acquire, by u&s;eful qualities, the e&s;teem of the good. From motives of vanity, health and peace are &s;acrificed, fortunes lavi&s;hed without credit or enjoyment, every relative and per&s;onal duty neglect|ed, and religion boldly &s;et at defiance. To be ad|mitted into the company of tho&s;e who di&s;grace the family title which they inherit, thou&s;ands plunge into debauchery without pa&s;&s;ion, into drunkenne&s;s with|out convivial enjoyment, into gaming without the means or inclination for play. Old age rapidly ad|vances. When vanity at length retreats from in&s;ult and from mortification, avarice &s;ucceeds; and mean|ne&s;s, and di&s;ea&s;e, and di&s;grace, and poverty, and di&s;|content, and de&s;pair, diffu&s;e clouds and darkne&s;s over the evening of life. Such is the lot of tho&s;e who glory in their &s;hame, and are a&s;hamed of their glory.</P>
<P>Have &s;en&s;e and re&s;olution enough, therefore, to give up all preten&s;ions to tho&s;e titles, of a fine fel|low, a rake, or whatever vulgar name the temporary cant of the vicious be&s;tows on the di&s;tingui&s;hed liber|tine. Pre&s;erve your principles, and be &s;teady in your conduct. And though your exemplary be|haviour may bring upon you the in&s;ulting and ironical appellation a Saint, a Puritan, or even a Methodi&s;t, per&s;evere in rectitude. It will be in your power &s;oon, not indeed to in&s;ult, but to pity. Have &s;pirit, and di&s;play it. But let it be that &s;ort of &s;pirit which urges you to proceed in the path in which you were placed by the faithful guide of your infancy. Exhibit a noble &s;uperiority in daring to di&s;regard the artful and malicious reproaches of the vain, who labour to make you a convert to folly, in order to
<PB N="4" REF="12">keep them in countenance. They will laugh at fir&s;t, but e&s;teem you in their hearts, even while they laugh, and in the end revere your virtue.</P>
<P>Let that generous courage which con&s;cious recti|tude in&s;pires, enable you to de&s;pi&s;e and neglect the a&s;&s;aults of ridicule. When all other modes of attack have failed, ridicule has &s;ucceeded. The bulwark of virtue, which &s;tood firmly again&s;t the weapons of argument, has tottered on its ba&s;is, or fallen to the ground, on the &s;lighte&s;t tough of magic ridicule. In the &s;chool, in the college, in the world at large, it is the powerful engine which is u&s;ed to level an exalted character. You will infallibly be attacked with it, if you be in any re&s;pect &s;ingular; and &s;ingular in many re&s;pects you mu&s;t be, if you be eminently virtuous.</P>
<P>With all your good qualities, unite the humility of a Chri&s;tian. Be not moro&s;e. Be cautious of overvaluing your&s;elf. Make allowances for the vices and erros which you will daily &s;ee. Remember that all have not had the benefit of moral in&s;truc|tion; that a great part of mankind are in effect or|phans, turned loo&s;e into the wide world, without one faithful friend to give them advice; left to find their own way in a dark and rugged wilderne&s;s, with &s;nares, and quick-&s;ands, and cha&s;ms, around them.</P>
<P>If you follow &s;uch advice as, from the pure mo|tive of &s;erving you mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially, I have given you, I will not indeed promi&s;e that you &s;hall not be un|fortunate, according to the common idea of the word; but I will confidently a&s;&s;ure you, that you &s;hall not be unhappy. I will not promi&s;e you worldly &s;ucce&s;s, but I will engage that you &s;hall de|&s;erve it, and &s;hall know how to bear its ab&s;ence.</P></Q>

<HEAD>On an exce&s;&s;ive and indi&s;criminate <HI>LOVE</HI> of <HI>COMPANY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE love of company and of &s;ocial plea&s;ures is natural to us, and attended with &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t &s;atisfactions of human life; but, like every other love, when it proceeds beyond the limits of mo|deration, it cea&s;es to produce its natural effects, and ter|minates in di&s;gu&s;tful &s;atiety. The foundation-&s;tone and the pillar on which we build the fabric of our fe|licity, mu&s;t be laid in our own hearts. Amu&s;ement, mirth, agreeable variety, and even improvement, may be &s;ometimes &s;ought in the gaiety of mixed company, and in the u&s;ual diver&s;ions of the world; but, if we found our general happine&s;s on the&s;e, we &s;hall do little more than rai&s;e ca&s;tles in the air, or build hou&s;es on the &s;and.</P>
<P>To derive the proper plea&s;ure and improvement from company, it ought to be &s;elect, and to con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons of character, re&s;pectable both for their morals and their under&s;tandings. Mixed and undi&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ociety tends only to di&s;&s;ipate our ideas, and induce a laxity of principles and practice. The plea&s;ure it affords is of a coar&s;e, vulgar, noi&s;y, and rude kind. Indeed, it com|monly ends in wearine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t, as even they are ready to confe&s;s, who yet con&s;tantly pur&s;ue it, as if their chief good con&s;i&s;ted in living in a crowd.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, indeed, who are exempted by their circum&s;tance from profe&s;&s;ional and official employ|ments, and who profe&s;&s;edly devote them&s;elves to a life of plea&s;ure, little el&s;e &s;eems to con&s;titute the idea of it, but and uncea&s;ing &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of company, public or pri|vate. The dre&s;s, and other circum&s;tances preparatory to the enjoyment of this plea&s;ure, &s;carcely leave a mo|ment for reflection. Day after day is &s;pent in the &s;ame
<PB N="6" REF="14">toil&s;ome round, till a habit is formed, which renders di&s;&s;ipation nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;tence. What, indeed, is life or its enjoyments without &s;ettle principles, lauda|ble purpo&s;es, mental exertions, and internal comfort? It is a &s;tate wor&s;e than non-entity, &s;ince it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a re&s;tle&s;s power of action, productive of nothing but mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I very &s;eriou&s;ly recommend, therefore, to all who wi&s;h to enjoy their exi&s;tence, (and who entertains not that wi&s;h?) that they &s;hould acquire not only a power of bearing, but of taking a plea&s;ure in temporary &s;oli|tude. Every one mu&s;t, indeed, &s;ometimes be alone. Let him not repine when he is alone, but learn to &s;et a value on the golden moments. It is then that he is enabled to &s;tudy him&s;elf and the world around him. It is then that he has an opportunity of &s;eeing things as they are, and of removing the deceitful veil, which almo&s;t every thing a&s;&s;umes in the bu&s;y &s;cene of worldly employments. The &s;oul is enabled to retire into her|&s;elf, and to exert tho&s;e energies which are always at|tended with &s;ublime plea&s;ure. She is enabled to &s;ee the dependent, frail, and wretched &s;tate of man as the child of nature, and incited by her di&s;covery to implore grace and protection from the Lord of the univer&s;e. They, indeed, who fly from &s;olitude, can &s;eldom be religious; for religion requires meditation. They may be &s;aid to live without God in the world; not, it is true, from athei&s;tical principles, but from a care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; a truly deplorable &s;tate, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which could not fail to cloud the gaiety of tho&s;e halcyon beings, who &s;port in the &s;un&s;hine of unremitted plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I may, I believe, a&s;&s;ert, that the love of plea&s;ure, the follies of fa&s;hion, and the extravagancies of di&s;&s;ipation, are greater enemies to religion, than all the writers who have endeavoured to attract notice by attacking Chri&s;|tianity. Many, it is to be feared, have lived and died in the regions of gaiety, without ever having felt a &s;en&s;e of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="15">Not only religion, virtue, and prudence, will be pro|moted by occa&s;ional &s;olitude, but a reli&s;h will be given to the rational enjoyment of a plea&s;urable life. Vi|ci&s;&s;itude is e&s;&s;ential to every &s;tate of durable enjoyment. He who has &s;pent a little part of his time in his clo&s;et, or in his groves, will partake of the gaieties of the a&s;|&s;embly with fre&s;h delight, as a man, when he is hungry finds an additional flavour in his daily food.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be remembered, that, in recommending &s;olitude, I mean only occa&s;ional &s;olitude. There is no doubt but man is made for action, and that his duties and plea&s;ures are often mo&s;t numerous and mo&s;t important amid&s;t the "bu&s;y hum of men." Many vices, and many corrupt di&s;po&s;itions, have been fo&s;tered in a &s;olitary life.</P>
<P>But nothing without moderation is durable or wi&s;e. Let there be a &s;weet interchange of retirement and a&s;|&s;ociation, of repo&s;e and activity. A few hours &s;pent every day by the votaries of plea&s;ure in &s;erous medita|tion, would render their plea&s;ure pure, and more un|mixed with mi&s;ery. It would give them knowledge, &s;o that they would &s;ee how far they might advance in their pur&s;uit without danger; and re&s;olution, &s;o that they might retreat when danger approached. It would teach them how to live; a knowledge, which indeed they think they po&s;&s;e&s;s already; and it would al&s;o teach them, what they are often too little &s;olicitous to learn, how to die.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> JOURNEY <HI>of a</HI> DAY, <HI>a</HI> PICTURE <HI>of</HI> HUMAN LIFE; <HI>the</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> OBIDAH.</HEAD>
<P>OBIDAH, the &s;on of Aben&s;ina, left the caravan&s;era early in the morning, and pur&s;ued his journey through the plains of Indo&s;tan. He was fre&s;h and vigorous with re&s;t; he was animated with hope; he was incited by de&s;ire; he walked &s;wiftly forward over the vallies, and &s;aw the hills gradually ri&s;ing before him. As he pa&s;&s;ed along, his ears were delighted with the morning &s;ong of the bird of paradi&s;e; he was fanned by the la&s;t &s;tutters of the &s;inking breeze, and &s;prinkled with dew by groves of &s;pices; he &s;ometimes contem|plated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and &s;ometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primro&s;e, elde&s;t daughter of the &s;pring: All his &s;en&s;es were gratified, and all care was bani&s;hed from the heart.</P>
<P>Thus he went on till the &s;un approached his meridi|an, and the increa&s;ing heat preyed upon his &s;trength; he then looked round about him for &s;ome more com|modious path. He &s;aw, on his right hand, a grove that &s;eemed to wave its &s;hades as a &s;ign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolne&s;s and verdure ir|re&s;i&s;tibly plea&s;ant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling, but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the &s;ame direction with the main road, and was plea&s;ed that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite plea&s;ure with bu&s;ine&s;s, and to gain the rewards of diligence, without &s;uffering its fatigues. He, there|fore, &s;till continued to walk for a time, without the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of his ardour, except that he was &s;ome|times tempted to &s;top by the mu&s;ic of the birds, whom the heat had a&s;&s;embled in the &s;hade, and &s;ometimes
<PB N="9" REF="17">amu&s;ed him&s;elf with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either &s;ide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At la&s;t the green path began to decline from its fir&s;t tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with water falls. Here Obidah pau&s;ed for a time, and be|gan to con&s;ider whether it were longer &s;afe to for&s;ake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greate&s;t violence, and that the plain was du&s;ty and uneven, he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the new path, which he &s;uppo&s;ed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at la&s;t in the common road.</P>
<P>Having thus calmed his &s;olicitude, he renewed his pace, though he &s;u&s;pected that he was not gaining ground. This unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every &s;en&s;ation that might &s;oothe or divert him. He li&s;tened to every echo, he mounted every hill for a fre&s;h pro&s;|pect, he turned a&s;ide to every ca&s;cade, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with tracing the cour&s;e of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolutions. In the&s;e amu&s;e|ments the hours pa&s;&s;ed away unaccounted; his devia|tions had perplexed his memory, and he knew not towards what point to travel. He &s;tood pen&s;ive and confu&s;ed, afraid to go forward left he &s;hould go wrong, yet con&s;cious that the time of loitering was now pa&s;t. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the &s;ky was over&s;pread with clouds, the day vani&s;hed form before him, and a &s;udden tempe&s;t gathered round his head. He was now rou&s;ed by his danger to a quick and pain|ful remembrance of his folly; he now &s;aw how happi|ne&s;s is lo&s;t when ea&s;e is con&s;ulted; he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to &s;eek &s;helter in the grove, and de&s;pi&s;ed the petty curio&s;ity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus re|flecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18">He now re&s;olved to do what remained yet in his power; to tread back the ground which he had pa&s;&s;ed, and try to find &s;ome i&s;&s;ue where the wood might open into the plain. He pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of nature. He ro&s;e with confidence and tranquillity, and pre&s;&s;ed on with his &s;abre in his hand, for the bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expira|tion; all the horrors of darkne&s;s and &s;olitude &s;urround|ed him; the winds roared in the woods, and the tor|rents tumbled from the hills.</P>
<Q><L>Work'd into &s;udden rage by wint'ry &s;howers,</L>
<L>Down the &s;teep hill the roaring torrent pours;</L>
<L>The mountain &s;hepherd hears the di&s;tant noi&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>Thus forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he wandered through the wild without knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to &s;afety or to de&s;truction. At length nor fear but labour be|gan to overcome him; his breath grew &s;hort, his knees trembled, and he was on the point of lying down in re&s;ignation to his fate, when he beheld through the brambles the glimmer of a taper. He advanced to|wards the light, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admi&s;&s;ion. The old man &s;et before him &s;uch provi&s;ions as he had collected for him&s;elf, on which Obidah fed with eagerne&s;s and gratitude.</P>
<P>When the repa&s;t was over, 'Tell me, &s;aid the her|mit, 'by what chance thou ha&s;t been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of this wilderne&s;s, in which I never &s;aw a man before.' Obi|dah then related the occurrences of his journey, with|out any concealment or palliation.</P>
<P>'Son,' &s;aid the hermit, 'let the errors and follies, the dangers and e&s;cape of this day, &s;ink deep into thy heart. Remember, my &s;on, that human life is the journey of a day. We ri&s;e in the morning of youth,
<PB N="11" REF="19">full of vigour and full of expectation; we &s;et forward with &s;pirit and hope, with gaiety and diligence, and travel on a while in the &s;traight road of piety towards the man&s;ions of re&s;t. In a &s;hort time we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find &s;ome mitigation of our duty, and &s;ome more ea&s;y means of obtaining the &s;ame end. We then relax our vigour, and re&s;olve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a di&s;tance, but rely upon our own con&s;tancy, and venture to approach what we re|&s;olve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ea&s;e, and repo&s;e in the &s;hades of &s;ecurity. Here the heart &s;oftens, and vigilance &s;ub&s;ides; we are then wil|ling to enquire whether another advance cannot be made, and whether we may not, at lea&s;t, turn our eyes upon the gardens of plea&s;ure. We approach them with &s;cruple and he&s;itation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pa&s;s through them without lo&s;ing the road of virtue, which we, for a while, keep in our &s;ight, and to which we propo&s;e to return. But temptation &s;ucceeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lo&s;e the happine&s;s of innocence, and &s;olace our di&s;quiet with &s;en&s;ual gratifications. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational de&s;ire. We entangle our&s;elves in bu&s;ine&s;s, immerge our&s;elves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of incon&s;tancy, till the darkne&s;s of old age begins to invade us, and di&s;ea&s;e and anxiety ob&s;truct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with &s;orrow, with repentance; and wi&s;h, but too often vainly wi&s;h, that we had not for&s;aken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my &s;on, who &s;hall learn from the example not to de&s;pair, but &s;hall remember, that though the day is pa&s;t, and their &s;trength is wa&s;ted, there yet remains one e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> to be made; that reformation is never hope|le&s;s, nor &s;incere endeavours ever una&s;&s;i&s;ted; that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he who implores &s;trength and courage from

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not remember to have read any di&s;cour&s;e written expre&s;sly upon the beauty and loveline&s;s of virtue, without con&s;idering it as a duty, and as the means of making us happy both now and hereafter. I de&s;ign therefore this &s;peculation as an e&s;&s;ay upon that &s;ubject, in which I will con&s;ider virtue no farther than as it is in it&s;elf of an amiable nature, after having premi&s;ed, that I under&s;tand by the word <HI>virtue</HI> &s;uch a general notion as is affixed to it by the writers of morality, and which by devout men generally goes under the name of <HI>religion,</HI> and by men of the world under the name of <HI>honour.</HI></P>
<P>Hypocri&s;y it&s;elf does great honour, or rather ju&s;tice, to religion, and tacitly acknowledges it to be an orna|ment to human nature. The hypocrite would not be at &s;o much pains to put on the appearance of virtue, if he did not know it was the mo&s;t proper and effectu|al means to gain the love and e&s;teem of mankind.</P>
<P>We learn from Hierocles, it was a common &s;aying among the heathens, that the wi&s;e man hates nobody, but loves only the virtuous.</P>
<P>Tully has a very beautiful gradation of thoughts to &s;hew how amiable virtue is. We love a virtuous man, &s;ays he, who lives in the remote&s;t parts of the earth, though we are altogether out of the reach of his virtue, and can receive from it no manner of benefit; nay, one who died &s;everal years ago, rai&s;es a &s;ecret fondne&s;s and benevolence for him in our minds, when we read
<PB N="13" REF="21">his &s;tory: Nay what is &s;till more, one who had been the enemy of our country, provided his wars were reg|ulated by ju&s;tice and humanity, as in the in&s;tance of Pyrrhus, whom Tully mentions on this occa&s;ion in op|po&s;ition to Hannibal. Such is the natural beauty and loveline&s;s of virtue!</P>
<P>It is a common ob&s;ervation, that the mo&s;t abandon|ed to all &s;en&s;e of goodne&s;s, are apt to wi&s;h tho&s;e who are related to them to be of a different character; and it is very ob&s;ervable, that none are more &s;truck with the charms of virtue in the fair &s;ex, than tho&s;e who by their very admiration of it are carried to a de&s;ire of ruining it.</P>
<P>A virtuous mind in a fair body is indeed a fine picture in a good light, and therefore it is no wonder that it makes the beautiful &s;ex all over charms.</P>
<P>As virtue in general is of an amiable and lovely na|ture, there are &s;ome particular kinds of it which are more &s;o than others, and the&s;e are &s;uch as di&s;po&s;e us to do good to mankind. Temperance and ab&s;tinence, faith and devotion, are in them&s;elves perhaps as lauda|ble as any other virtues; but tho&s;e which make a man popular and beloved, are ju&s;tice, charity, munificence, and, in &s;hort, all the good qualities that render us be|neficial to each other. For which rea&s;on even an ex|travagant man, who has nothing el&s;e to recommend him but a fal&s;e genero&s;ity, is often more beloved and e&s;teemed than a per&s;on of a much more fini&s;hed character, who is defective in this particular.</P>
<P>The two great ornaments of virtue, which &s;hew her in the mo&s;t advantageous views, and make her altoge|ther lovely, are chearfulne&s;s and good-nature. The&s;e generally go together, as a man cannot be agreeable to others who is not ea&s;y within him&s;elf. They are both very requi&s;ite in a virtuous mind, to keep out melan|choly from the many &s;erious thoughts it is engaged in, and to hinder its natural hatred of vice from &s;ouring in|to &s;everity and cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS <HI>the frequent</HI> CAUSE <HI>of</HI> IMMORAL CONDUCT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all our complaints of the uncertainty of human affairs, it is undoubtedly true, that more mi&s;ery is produced among us by the irregularities of our tempers, than by real misfortunes.</P>
<P>And it is a circum&s;tance particularly unhappy, that the&s;e irregularities of the temper are very apt to di&s;play them&s;elves at our fire-&s;ides, where every thing ought to be tranquil and &s;erene. But the truth is, we are awed by the pre&s;ence of &s;trangers, and are afraid of appearing weak or ill-natured when we act in the &s;ight of the world; and &s;o, very heroically, re&s;erve all our ill-humour for our wives, children, and &s;ervants. We are meek where we might meet with oppo&s;ition, but feel our&s;elves undauntedly bold where we are &s;ure of no effectual re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The perver&s;ion of the be&s;t things converts them to the wor&s;t. Home is certainly well adapted to repo&s;e and &s;olid enjoyment. Among parents and brothers, and all the tender ties of private life, the gentler affec|tions, which are always attended with feelings purely and permanently plea&s;urable, find an ample &s;cope for proper exertion. The experienced have often declared, after wearying them&s;elves in pur&s;uing phantoms, that they have found a &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s in the dome&s;tic circle. Hither they have returned from their wild ex|cur&s;ions in the regions of di&s;&s;ipation; as the bird, after fluttering in the air, de&s;cends into her ne&s;t, to partake and to increa&s;e its genial warmth with her young ones.</P>
<P>Such and &s;o &s;weet are the comforts of home, when it is not perverted by the folly and weakne&s;s of man. Indifference, and a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s on the &s;ubject of plea&s;ing tho&s;e whom it is our be&s;t intere&s;t to plea&s;e, often ren|der it a &s;cene of dulne&s;s and in&s;ipidity. Happy if the
<PB N="15" REF="23">evil extended no farther. But the tran&s;ition from the negative &s;tate of not being plea&s;ed, to po&s;itive ill-hu|mour, is but too ea&s;y. Fretfulne&s;s and peevi&s;hne&s;s ari&s;e, as nettles vegetate, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, where no &s;alu|tary plants are cultivated. One unkind expre&s;&s;ion in|fallibly generates many others. Trifles light as air are able to kindle the blaze of contention. By frequent conflicts and unre&s;erved familiarity, all that mutual re&s;pect which is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve love, even in the mo&s;t intimate connections, is entirely lo&s;t, and the faint affection which remains is too feeble to be felt amid the furious operation of the hateful pa&s;&s;ions. Farewel peace and tranquillity, and cheerful conver&s;e, and all the boa&s;ted comforts of the family circle.</P>
<P>But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on the mi&s;ery of family di&s;&s;en&s;ion. I mean more particularly to &s;ugge&s;t, that family di&s;&s;en&s;ion, be&s;ides all its own immediate evils, is the fruitful parent of immoral conduct.</P>
<P>When the &s;everal parts which compo&s;e a family find them&s;elves unea&s;y in that home which is naturally the feat of mutual enjoyment, they are tempted from the &s;traight road of common prudence, to pur&s;ue their happine&s;s through a devious wild of pa&s;&s;ion and ima|gination. The &s;on, arrived at years of maturity, who is treated har&s;hly at home, will &s;eldom &s;pend his even|ings at the dome&s;tic fire-&s;ide. If he live in the metro|polis, he will fly for refuge to the places of public di|ver&s;ion. There, it is very probable, &s;ome unhappy connection will be formed, which cannot be continued without a plentiful &s;upply of money. Perhaps money cannot be procured hone&s;tly but from the parent; but money mu&s;t at all events be procured. What then re|mains, but to pur&s;ue tho&s;e methods which unprincipled ingenuity has invented, and which, &s;ooner or later, lead to their condign puni&s;hments, pain, &s;hame, and death?</P>
<P>But though the con&s;equences are not always &s;uch as the operation of human laws produces, yet they are al|ways terrible, and de&s;tructive of happine&s;s and virtue. Mi&s;ery is indeed the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of all deviation
<PB N="16" REF="24">from rectitude; but early debauchery, early di&s;ea&s;e, early profligacy of all kinds, are peculiarly fruitful of wretchedne&s;s; as they &s;ow the &s;eeds of mi&s;ery in the &s;pring of life, when all that is &s;own &s;trikes deep root, and buds and blo&s;&s;oms, and brings forth fruit in profu&s;e abundance.</P>
<P>In the di&s;agreements between children and parents, it is certain that the children and u&s;ually mo&s;t culpable. Their violent pa&s;&s;ions and defective experience render them di&s;obedient and undutiful. Their love of plea|&s;ure operates &s;o violently, as often to de&s;troy the force of filial affection. A parent is &s;tung to the heart by the ingratitude of a child. He checks his precipitancy, and perhaps with too little command of temper; for who can always hold the reins? A&s;perity produces a&s;|perity. But the child was the aggre&s;&s;or, and therefore de&s;erves a great part of the mi&s;ery which en&s;ues. It is however certain, that the parent is often imprudent, as well as the child undutiful. He &s;hould endeavour to render home agreeable by gentlene&s;s and rea&s;onable in|dulgence: For man at every age &s;eeks to be plea&s;ed, but more particularly at the juvenile age. He &s;hould indeed maintain his authority; but it &s;hould be like the mild dominion of a limited monarch, and not the iron rule of an au&s;tere tyrant. If home be rendered plea&s;ing, it will not long be de&s;erted. The prodigal will &s;oon return, when his father's hou&s;e is always ready to receive him with joy.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid of the con&s;equences of dome&s;tic di&s;|union to &s;ons, is equally to be applied to daughters. Indeed, as the mi&s;conduct of daughters is more fatal to family peace, though perhaps not more heinous in a moral view, particular care &s;hould be taken to render them attached to the comforts of the family circle. When their home is di&s;agreeable, they will be ready to make any exchange; and will often lo&s;e their cha|racters, virtue, and happine&s;s, in the pur&s;uit of it. In|deed the female character and happine&s;s are &s;o ea&s;ily injured, that no &s;olicitude can be too great in their
<PB N="17" REF="25">pre&s;ervation. But prudence is nece&s;&s;ary in every good cau&s;e, as well as zeal; and it is found by experience, that the gentle&s;t method of government, if it be limited and directed by good &s;en&s;e, is the be&s;t. It ought in|deed to be &s;teady, but not rigid; and every plea&s;ure which is innocent in it&s;elf and in its con&s;equences, ought to be admitted, with a view to render le&s;s di&s;a|greeable that unwinking vigilance which a delicate and &s;en&s;ible father will judge nece&s;&s;ary in the care of a daughter.</P>
<P>To what wickedne&s;s, as well as wretchedne&s;s, ma|trimonial di&s;agreements lead, every day's hi&s;tory will clearly inform us. When the hu&s;band is driven from his home by a termagant, he will &s;eek enjoyment, which is denied him at his own home, in the haunts of vice, and in the riots of intemperance: Nor can female cor|ruption be wondered at, though it mu&s;t be greatly pitied and regretted, when in the heart of a hu&s;band, which love and friend&s;hip &s;hould warm, hatred is found to rankle. Conjugal infelicity not only renders life mo&s;t uncomfortable, but leads to that de&s;perate di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in manners, which terminates in the ruin of health, peace, and fortune. If we may form a judgment from the divorces and &s;eparations which happen in the gay world, we may conclude, that the pre&s;ent manners are highly unfavourable to conjugal fe|licity. And we &s;ee, con&s;i&s;tently with my theory, that the con&s;equence of the&s;e dome&s;tic di&s;agreements is the prevalence of vice in a very predominant degree, as well as of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But it avails little to point out evils without recom|mending a remedy. One of the fir&s;t rules which &s;ug|ge&s;ts it&s;elf is, that families &s;hould endeavour, by often and &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on the &s;ubject, to convince them&s;elves, that not only the enjoyment, but the virtue of every individual, greatly depends on a cordial union. When they are convinced of this, they will endeavour to promote it; and it fortunately happens, that the very wi&s;h and attempt of every individual mu&s;t infalli|bly
<PB N="18" REF="26">&s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s. It may indeed be difficult to re|&s;train the occa&s;ional &s;allies of temper; but where there is, in the more di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate moments, a &s;ettled de&s;ire to pre&s;erve dome&s;tic union, the tran&s;ient violence of pa&s;&s;ion will not often produce a permanent rupture.</P>
<P>It is another mo&s;t excellent rule, to avoid a <HI>gro&s;s fa|miliarity,</HI> even where the connection is mo&s;t intimate. The human heart is &s;o con&s;tituted as to love re&s;pect. It would indeed by unnatural in very intimate friends to behave to each other with &s;tiffne&s;s; but there is a delicacy of manner, and a flattering deference, which tends to pre&s;erve that degree of e&s;teem which is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport affection, and which is lo&s;t in contempt when it deviates into exce&s;&s;ive familiarity. An habitu|al politene&s;s of manners will prevent even indifference from degenerating to hatred. It will refine, exalt, and perpetuate affection.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t and mo&s;t efficacious rule is, that we &s;hould not think our moral and religious duties are on|ly to be practi&s;ed in public, and in the &s;ight of tho&s;e from who&s;e applau&s;e we expect the gratification of our vanity, ambition, or avarice; but that we &s;hould be equally attentive to our behaviour among tho&s;e who can only repay us by reciprocal love. We mu&s;t &s;hew the &s;incerity of our principles and profe&s;&s;ions by acting con&s;i&s;tently with them, not only in the &s;enate, in the field, in the pulpit, at the bar, or in any public a&s;&s;embly, but at the <HI>fire-&s;ide.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> VOYAGE <HI>of</HI> LIFE; <HI>an</HI> ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P>'LIFE,' &s;ays Seneca, 'is a voyage, in the progre&s;s of which we are perpetually changing our &s;cenes: We fir&s;t leave childhood behind us, then youth, then the years of ripened manhood, then the better or more plea&s;ing part of old age.'&mdash;The peru&s;al of this pa&s;&s;age having excited in me a train of reflec|tions on the &s;tate of man, the ince&s;&s;ant fluctuation of his wi&s;hes, the gradual change of his di&s;po&s;ition to all external objects, and the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s with which he floats along the &s;tream of time, I &s;unk into a &s;lum|ber amid&s;t my mediations, and, on a &s;udden, found my ears filled with the tumult of labour, the &s;houts of alacrity, the &s;hrieks of alarm, the whi&s;tle of winds, and the da&s;h of waters.</P>
<P>My a&s;toni&s;hment for a time repre&s;&s;ed my curio&s;ity; but &s;oon recovering my&s;elf &s;o far as to enquire whither we were going, and what was the cau&s;e of &s;uch clamour and confu&s;ion? I was told that we were launching out into the ocean of Life; that we had already pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights of Infancy, in which multitudes had per|i&s;hed, &s;ome by the weakne&s;s and fragility or negligence, of tho&s;e who undertook to &s;teer them; and that we were now on the main &s;ea, abandoned to the winds and billows, without any other means of &s;ecurity than the care of the pilot, whom it was always in our power to chu&s;e, among great numbers that offered their direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I then looked round with anxious eagerne&s;s; and fir&s;t turning my eyes behind me, &s;aw a &s;tream flowing through flowery i&s;lands, which every one that &s;ailed along &s;eemed to behold with plea&s;ure; but no &s;ooner touched, than the current, which though not noi&s;y or turbulent, was yet irre&s;i&s;tible, bore him away. Be|yond the&s;e i&s;lands all was darkne&s;s, nor could any of the pa&s;&s;engers de&s;cribe the &s;hore at which he fir&s;t em|barked.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28">Before me, and on either &s;ide, was an expan&s;e of waters violently agitated, and covered with &s;o thick a mi&s;t, that the mo&s;t per&s;picacious eye could &s;ee but a little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and whirl|pools, for many &s;unk unexpectedly while they were courting the gale with full &s;ails, and in&s;ulting tho&s;e whom they had left behind. So numerous, indeed, were the dangers, and &s;o thick the darkne&s;s, that no caution could confer &s;ecurity. Yet there were many, who, by fal&s;e intelligence, betrayed their followers into whirl|pools, or by violence pu&s;hed tho&s;e whom they found in their way again&s;t the rocks.</P>
<P>The current was invariable and in&s;urmountable; but though it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ail again&s;t it, or to return to the place that was once pa&s;&s;ed, yet it was not &s;o violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity or courage, &s;ince, though none could retreat back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by oblique direc|tion.</P>
<P>It was, however, not very common to &s;teer with much care or prudence; for, by &s;ome univer&s;al infa|tuation, every man appeared to think him&s;elf &s;afe, tho' he &s;aw his con&s;orts every moment &s;inking round him; and no &s;ooner had the waves clo&s;ed over them, than their fate and their mi&s;conduct were forgotten; the voyage was pur&s;ue with the &s;ame jocund confidence; every man congratulated him&s;elf upon the &s;oundne&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el, and believed him&s;elf able to &s;tem the whirl|pool in which his friend was &s;wallowed, or glide over the rocks on which he was da&s;hed: Nor was it often ob&s;erved that the &s;ight of a wreck made any man change his cour&s;e; if he turned for a moment, he &s;oon forgot the rudder, and left him&s;elf again to the di&s;po&s;al of chance.</P>
<P>This negligence did not proceed from indifference, or from wearine&s;s of their pre&s;ent condition; for not one of tho&s;e who thus ru&s;hed upon de&s;truction failed, when he was finking, to call upon his a&s;&s;ociates for that help which could not now be given him: And many
<PB N="21" REF="29">&s;pent their la&s;t moments in cautioning others again&s;t the folly by which they were intercepted in the mid&s;t of their cour&s;e. Their benevolence was &s;ometimes prai&s;ed, but their admonitions were unregarded.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els in which we had embarked, being con|fe&s;&s;edly unequal to the turbulence of the &s;tream of life, were vi&s;ibly impaired in the cour&s;e of the voyage, &s;o that every pa&s;&s;enger was certain, that how long &s;o|ever he might by favourable accidents, or by ince&s;&s;ant vigilance, be pre&s;erved, he mu&s;t &s;ink at la&s;t.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;ity of peri&s;hing might have been expect|ed to &s;adden the gay, and intimidate the daring, at lea&s;t to keep the melancholy and timorous in perpetual tor|ments, and hinder them from any enjoyment of the varieties and gratifications which nature offered them as the &s;olace of their labours; yet in effect none &s;eemed le&s;s to expect de&s;truction than tho&s;e to whom it was mo&s;t dreadful; they all had the art of concealing their danger from them&s;elves; and tho&s;e who knew their in|ability to bear the &s;ight of the terrors that embarra&s;&s;ed their way, took care never to look forward, but found &s;ome amu&s;ement of the pre&s;ent moment, and generally entertained them&s;elves by playing with Hope, who was the con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociate of the Voyage of Life.</P>
<P>Yet all that Hope ventured to promi&s;e, even to tho&s;e whom &s;he favoured mo&s;t, was, not that they &s;hould e&s;cape, but that they &s;hould &s;ink la&s;t; and with this promi&s;e every one was &s;atisfied, though he laughed at the re&s;t for &s;eeming to believe it. Hope, indeed, ap|parently mocked the credulity of her companions; for, in proportion as their ve&s;&s;els grew leaky, &s;he redoubled her a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety; and none were more bu&s;y in making provi&s;ions for a long voyage, than they whom all but them&s;elves &s;aw likely to peri&s;h &s;oon by irrepara|ble decay.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the current of Life was the gulf of Intemperance, a dreadful whirlpool, inter&s;per&s;ed with rocks, of which the pointed crags were concealed under water, and the tops covered with herbage, on which
<PB N="22" REF="30">Ea&s;e &s;pread couches of repo&s;e; and with &s;hades, where Plea&s;ure warbled the &s;ong of invitation. Within fight of the&s;e rocks, all who &s;ailed on the ocean of Life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s. Rea&s;on indeed was always at hand to &s;teer the pa&s;&s;engers through a narrow outlet, by which they might e&s;cape; but very few could, by her intreaties or remon&s;trances, be induced to put the rud|der into her hand, without &s;tipulating that &s;he &s;hould approach &s;o near unto the rocks of Plea&s;ure, that they might &s;olace them&s;elves with a &s;hort enjoyment of that delicious region, after which they always determined to pur&s;ue their cour&s;e without any other deviation.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on was too often prevailed upon &s;o far by the&s;e promi&s;es, as to venture her charge within the eddy of the gulf of Intemperance, where, indeed, the circum|volution was weak, but yet interrupted the cour&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el, and drew it, by in&s;en&s;ible rotations, towards the centre. She then repented her temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to retreat; but the draught of the gulph was generally too &s;trong to be overcome; and the pa&s;&s;enger, having danced in circles with a plea&s;ing and giddy velocity, was at la&s;t overwhelmed and lo&s;t. Tho&s;e few whom Rea&s;on was able to extri|cate, generally &s;uffered &s;o many &s;hocks upon the points which &s;hot out from the rocks of Plea&s;ure, that they were unable to continue their cour&s;e with the &s;ame &s;trength and facility as before, but floated along timor|ou&s;ly and feebly, endangered by every breeze, and &s;hat|tered by every ruffle of the water, till they &s;unk, by &s;low degrees, after long &s;truggles, and innumerable ex|pedients, always repining at their own folly, and warn|ing others again&s;t the gulf of Intemperance.</P>
<P>There were arti&s;ts who profe&s;&s;ed to repair the breaches and &s;top the leaks of the ve&s;&s;els which had been &s;hatter|ed on the rocks of Plea&s;ure. Many appeared to have great confidence in their &s;kill, and &s;ome, indeed, were pre&s;erved by it from &s;inking, who had received only a &s;ingle blow; but I remarked that few ve&s;&s;els la&s;ted long which had been much repaired, nor was it found that
<PB N="23" REF="31">the arti&s;ts them&s;elves continued afloat longer than tho&s;e who had lea&s;t of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The only advantage which, in the Voyage of Life, the cautious had above the negligent, was, that they &s;unk later, and more &s;uddenly; for they pa&s;&s;ed forward till they had &s;ometimes &s;een all tho&s;e in who&s;e company they had i&s;&s;ued from the &s;treights of Infancy, peri&s;h in the way, and at la&s;t were over&s;et by a cro&s;s breeze, without the toil of re&s;i&s;tance, or the angui&s;h of expec|tation. But &s;uch as had often fallen again&s;t the rocks of Plea&s;ure, commonly &s;ub&s;ided by &s;en&s;ible degrees, contended long with the encroaching waters, and har|ra&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by labours that &s;carcely Hope her&s;elf could flatter with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As I was looking upon the various fate of the multi|tude about me, I was &s;uddenly alarmed with an admo|nition from &s;ome unknown power, 'Gaze not idly upon others when thou thy&s;elf and &s;inking. Whence is this thoughtle&s;s tranquillity, when thou and they are equal|ly endangered?' I looked, and &s;eeing the gulf of Intem|perance before me, &s;tarted and awaked.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS <HI>on the</HI> SWIFTNESS <HI>of</HI> TIME.</HEAD>
<P>THE natural advantages which ari&s;e from the po|&s;ition of the earth which we inhabit, with re&s;|pect to the other planets, afford much employment to mathematical &s;peculation, by which it has been di&s;|covered, that no other conformation of the &s;y&s;tem could have given &s;uch commodious di&s;tributions of light and heat, or imparted fertility and plea&s;ure to &s;o great a part of a revolving &s;phere.</P>
<P>It may be perhaps ob&s;erved by the morali&s;t, with e|qual rea&s;on, that our globe &s;eems particularly fitted for the re&s;idence of a being, placed here only for a &s;hort
<PB N="24" REF="32">time, who&s;e ta&s;k is to advance him&s;elf to a higher and happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence, by unremitted vigilance of caution, and activity of virtue.</P>
<P>The duties required of man are &s;uch as human nature does not willingly perform, and &s;uch as tho&s;e are in|clined to delay who yet intend &s;ome time to fulfil them. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that this univer&s;al reluctance &s;hould be counteracted, and the drow&s;ine&s;s of he&s;ita|tion wakened into re&s;olve; that the danger of procraf|tination &s;hould be always in view, and the fallacies of &s;ecurity be hourly detected.</P>
<P>To this end all the appearances of nature uniformly con&s;pire. Whatever we &s;ee on every &s;ide, reminds us of the lap&s;e of time and the flux of life. The day and night &s;ucceed each other; the rotation of &s;ea&s;ons diver|&s;ifies the year; the &s;un ri&s;es, attains the meridian, de|clines and &s;ets; and the moon every night changes its form.</P>
<P>He that is carried forward, however &s;wiftly, by a motion equitable and ea&s;y, perceives not the change of place but by the variation of objects. If the wheel of life, which rolls thus &s;ilently along, pa&s;&s;ed on through undi&s;tingui&s;hable uniformity, we &s;hould never mark its approaches to the end of the cour&s;e. If one hour were like another; if the pa&s;&s;age of the &s;un did not &s;hew that the day is wa&s;ting: if the change of &s;ea&s;ons did not impre&s;s upon us the flight of the year, quantities of duration equal to days and years would glide unob&s;erv|ed. If the parts of time were not variou&s;ly coloured, we &s;hould never di&s;cern their departure of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but &s;hould live thoughtle&s;s of the pa&s;t, and carele&s;s of the future, without will, and perhaps without power, to compute the periods of life, or to compare the time which is alreadly lo&s;t with that which may probably re|main.</P>
<P>Yet it is certain that the&s;e admonitions of nature, however forcible, however importunate, are too often vain; and that many who mark with &s;uch accuracy the cour&s;e of time, appear to have little &s;en&s;ibility of the
<PB N="25" REF="33">decline of life. Every man has &s;omething to do which he neglects; every man has faults to conquer which he delays to combat.</P>
<P>So little do we accu&s;tom our&s;elves to con&s;ider the effects of time, that things nece&s;&s;ary and certain often &s;urpri&s;e us like unexpected contingencies. We leave the beauty in her bloom, and, after an ab&s;ence of twen|ty years, wonder, at our return, to find her faded. We meet tho&s;e whom we left children, and can &s;carcely per&s;uade our&s;elves to treat them as men. The travel|ler vi&s;its in age tho&s;e countries through which he ram|bled in his youth, and hopes for merriment at the old place. The man of bu&s;ine&s;s, wearied with un&s;atisfac|tory pro&s;perity, retires to the town of his nativity, and expects to play away the la&s;t years with the compa|nions of his childhood, and recover youth in the fields where he once was young.</P>
<P>From this inattention, &s;o general and &s;o mi&s;chievous, let it be every man's &s;tudy to exampt him&s;elf. Let him that de&s;ires to &s;ee others happy, make ha&s;te to give while his gift can be enjoyed, and remember, that every moment of delay takes away &s;omething from the value of his benefaction. And let him who &s;eeks his own happine&s;s, reflect, that while he forms his purpo&s;e the day rolls on, 'and the night cometh, when no man can work.'</P>

<P>WHEN you look forward to tho&s;e plans of life, which either your circum&s;tances have &s;ug|ge&s;ted, or your friends have propo&s;ed, you will not he&s;itate to acknowledge, that in order to pur&s;ue them with advantage, &s;ome previous di&s;cipline is requi&s;ite. Be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever is to be your profe&s;&s;ion, no education is more nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;ucce&s;s, than the acquirement of virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and habits. This is the univer&s;al preparation for every character, and every &s;tation of life. Bad as the world is, re&s;pect is always paid to virtue. In the u&s;ual cour&s;e of human affairs it will be found, that a plain under&s;tanding, joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to pro&s;perity than the brighte&s;t parts without probity or honour. Whether &s;cience, or bu&s;ine&s;s, or public life,

It is con|nected with emiuence, in every liberal art; with repu|tation, in every branch of fair and u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s; with di&s;tinction, in every public &s;tation. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight which it adds to character; the generous &s;entiments which it breathes; the undaunted &s;pirit which it in&s;pires, the ardour of diligence which it quickens, the freedom which it procures from pernicious and di&s;honourable avoca|tions, are the foundations of all that is high in fame, or great in &s;ucce&s;s among men. Whatever orna|mental or engaging endowments you now po&s;&s;e&s;s, virtue is a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite, in order to their &s;hining with proper lu&s;tre.

Be&s;ides the guilt which is thereby incurred, nothing gives a more odious appearance of petulance and pre&s;umption to youth, than the affectation of treating religion with levity.
<PB N="29" REF="37">In&s;tead of being an evidence of &s;uperior under&s;tanding, it di&s;covers a pert and &s;hallow mind; which, vain of the fir&s;t &s;matterings of knowledge, pre&s;umes to make light of what the re&s;t of mankind revere. At the &s;ame time, you are not to imagine, that when exhorted to be religious, you are called upon to become more for|mal and &s;olemn in your manners than others of the &s;ame years; or to erect your&s;elves into &s;upercilious re|provers of tho&s;e around you.

As a great part of your happine&s;s is to depend on the connections which you form with others, it is of high importance that you acquire betimes the temper and the manners which will render &s;uch connections comfortable. Let a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice be the foundation of all &s;ocial quali|ties. In your mo&s;t early intercour&s;e with the world, and even in your youthful amu&s;ements, let no unfair|ne&s;s be found. Engrave on your mind that &s;acred rule, of 'doing in all things to others, according as you wi&s;h that they &s;hould do unto you.' For this end, impre&s;s your&s;elves with a deep &s;en&s;e of the original and natu|ral equality of men. Whatever advantages of birth or fortune you po&s;&s;e&s;s, never di&s;play them with an o&s;tentatious &s;uperiority. Leave the &s;ubordinations to rank, to regulate the intercour&s;e of more advanced years. At pre&s;ent it becomes you to act among your companions, as man with man. Remember how un|known to you are the vici&s;&s;itudes of the world; and how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous young men once looked down with &s;corn, have ri&s;en to be their &s;uperiors in future years. Compa&s;&s;ion is
<PB N="31" REF="39">an emotion, of which you never ought to be a&s;hamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of &s;ympathy, and the heart that melts at the tale of woe. Let not ea&s;e and indulgence contract your affections, and wrap you up in &s;elfi&s;h enjoyment. Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to think of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human life; of the &s;olitary cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan. Never &s;port with pain and di&s;tre&s;s, in any of your amu&s;ements; nor treat even the meane&s;t in&s;ect with wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>In order to render your&s;elves amiable in &s;ociety, cor|rect every appearance of har&s;hne&s;s in behaviour. Let that courte&s;y di&s;tingui&s;h your demeanour, which &s;prings not &s;o much from &s;tudied politene&s;s, as from a mild and gentle heart. Follow the cu&s;toms of the world in matters indifferent; but &s;top when they become &s;inful. Let your manners be &s;imple and natural; and of cour&s;e they will be engaging. Affectation is certain deformi|ty. By forming your&s;elves on fanta&s;tic models, and vying with one another in every reigning folly, the young begin with being ridiculous, and end in being vicious.</P>

<HEAD>VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES <HI>once</HI> LOST <HI>cannot be</HI> RECALLED.</HEAD>
<P>LET not any one vainly imagine, that the time and valuable opportunities which are now lo&s;t, can hereafter be recalled at will; or that he who has run out his youthful days in di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure, will have it in his power to &s;top when he plea&s;es, and make a wi&s;er u&s;e of his riper years. Yet this is too general|ly the fallacious hope that flatters the youth in his &s;en|&s;ual indulgences, and leads him in&s;en&s;ibly on in the treacherous ways of vice, till it is too late to return. There are few, who at one plunge &s;o totally immerge in
<PB N="32" REF="40">plea&s;ures, as to drown at once all power of rea&s;on and con&s;cience: They promi&s;e them&s;elves, they can indulge their appetites to &s;uch a point only, and can check and turn them back when they have run their allotted race. I do not indeed &s;ay that there never have been per&s;ons in whom the &s;trong ferment of youthful lu&s;ts may have happily &s;ub&s;ided, and who may have brought forth fruits of amendment, and di&s;|played many eminent virtues. God forbid! that even the mo&s;t licentious vices of youth &s;hould be ab&s;olutely incorrigible. But I may venture to affirm, that the in|&s;tances in this ca&s;e have been &s;o rare, that it is very dangerous for any one to tru&s;t to the experiment, upon a pre&s;umption that he &s;hall add to the number. The only &s;ure way to make any proficiency in a virtuous life, is to &s;et out in it betimes. It is then, when our inclinations are trained up in the way that they &s;hould lead us, that cu&s;tom &s;oon makes the be&s;t habits the mo&s;t agreeable; the ways of wi&s;dom become the ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and every &s;tep we advance, they grow more ea&s;y and more delightful. But, on the contrary, when vicious, head&s;trong appetites are to be reclaimed, and inveterate habits to be corrected, what &s;ecurity can we give our&s;elves, that we &s;hall have either incli|nation, re&s;olution, or power, to &s;top and turn back, and recover the right way from which we have &s;o long and &s;o widely wandered, and enter upon a new life, when perhaps our &s;trength now faileth us, and we know not how near we may be to our journey's end? The&s;e reflections I have &s;ugge&s;ted principally for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, who, allowing them&s;elves in greater in|dulgences than are con&s;i&s;tent with a liberal and virtu|ous education, give evident proofs that they are not &s;ufficiently aware of the dangerous encroachments, and the peculiar deceitfulne&s;s of plea&s;urable &s;in. Happy for them, would they once seriou&s;ly con&s;ider their ways! and no time can be more proper, than when the&s;e &s;olemn &s;ea&s;ons of recollection and religious. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;|cipline &s;hould particularly di&s;po&s;e them to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="41">and thought. They would then di&s;cover, that though they are awhile carried gently and &s;upinely down the &s;mooth &s;tream of plea&s;ure, yet &s;oon the torrent will grow too violent to be &s;temmed; the waves will ari&s;e, and da&s;h them upon rocks, or &s;ink them in whirlpools. It is therefore the part of prudence to &s;top &s;hort while they may, and to divert their cour&s;e into a different channel; which, whatever ob&s;tructions and difficulties they may labour with at fir&s;t, will every day become more practicable and plea&s;ing, and will a&s;&s;uredly carry them to a &s;erene and &s;ecure haven.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> VIRTUE <HI>of</HI> GENTLENESS.</HEAD>
<P>GENTLENESS corrects whatever is offen&s;ive in our manners; and, by a con&s;tant train of hu|mane attentions, &s;tudies to alleviate the burden of com|mon mi&s;ery. Its office, therefore, is exten&s;ive. It is not, like &s;ome other virtues, called forth only on pe|culiar emergencies; but it is continually in action, when we are engaged in intercour&s;e with men. It ought to form our addre&s;s, to regulate our &s;peech, and to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over our whole behaviour.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by &s;ome, that this gentlene&s;s on which we now in&s;i&s;t, regards only tho&s;e &s;maller offices in life, which, in their eyes, are not e&s;|&s;ential to religion and goodne&s;s. Negligent, they con|fe&s;s, on &s;light occa&s;ions, of the government of their temper, or the regulation of their behaviour, they are attentive, as they pretend, to the great duties of bene|ficence; and ready, whenever the opportunity pre|&s;ents, to perform important &s;ervices to their fellow-creatures. But let &s;uch per&s;ons reflect, that the occa|&s;ions of performing tho&s;e important good deeds very rarely occur. Perhaps their &s;ituation in life, or the
<PB N="34" REF="42">nature of their connections, may, in a great mea&s;ure, exclude them from &s;uch opportunites. Great events give &s;cope for great virtues: but the main tenor of hu|man life is compo&s;ed of &s;mall occurrences. Within the round of the&s;e, lie the materials of the happine&s;s of mo&s;t men; the &s;ubjects of their duty, and the trials of their virtue. Virtue mu&s;t be formed and &s;upported, not by unfrequent acts, but by daily and repeated ex|ertions. In order to its becoming either vigorous or u&s;eful, it mu&s;t be habitually active; not breaking forth occa&s;ionally with a tran&s;ient lu&s;tre, like the blaze of the comet; but regular in its returns, like the light of day; not like the aromatic gale, which &s;ometimes fea&s;ts the &s;en&s;e; but, like the ordinary breeze, which puri|fies the air, and renders it healthful.</P>
<P>Years may pa&s;s over our heads, without affording any opportunity for acts of high beneficence, or exten|&s;ive utility. Whereas, not a day pa&s;&s;es, but in the common tran&s;actions of life, and e&s;pecially in the in|tercour&s;e of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, gentlene&s;s finds place for promoting the happine&s;s of others, and for &s;trength|ening in our&s;elves the habit of virtue.</P>
<P>Gentlene&s;s is, in truth, the great avenue to mutual enjoyment. Amidit the &s;trife of interfering intere&s;ts, it tempers the violence of contention, and keeps alive the &s;eeds of harmony.</P>
<P>Whatever ends a good man can be &s;uppo&s;ed to pur|&s;ue, gentlene&s;s will be found to favour them; it pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and wins every heart; it per&s;uades, when every other argument fails; often di&s;arms the fierce, and often melts the &s;tubborn. Whereas, har&s;hne&s;s con|firms the oppo&s;ition it would &s;ubdue; and, of an in|different per&s;on, creates an enemy.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the effect of this virtue on our external condition, its influence on our internal enjoy|ment is certain and powerful. That inward tranquilli|ty which it promotes, is the fir&s;t requi&s;ite to every plea&s;urable feeling. It is the calm and clear atmo&s;|phere, the &s;erenity and &s;un&s;hine of the mind. When
<PB N="35" REF="43">benignity and gentlene&s;s reign within, we are always lea&s;t in hazard of being ruffled from without; every per&s;on, and every occurrence, are beheld in the mo&s;t favourable light. But let &s;ome clouds of di&s;gu&s;t and ill-humour gather on the mind, and immediately the &s;cene changes: Nature &s;eems transformed; and the appearance of all things is blackened to our view. The gentle mind is like the &s;mooth &s;tream, which re|flects every object in its ju&s;t proportion, and in its faire&s;t colours. The violent &s;pirit, like troubled wa|ters, renders back the images of the things di&s;torted and broken; and communicates to them all that di&s;ordered motion which ari&s;es &s;olely from its own agitation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> BALANCE <HI>of</HI> HAPPINESS EQUAL.</HEAD>
<P>AN exten&s;ive contemplation of human affairs, will lead us to this conclu&s;ion, that among the dif|ferent conditions and ranks of men, the balance of happine&s;s is pre&s;erved in a great mea&s;ure equal; and that the high and the low, the rich and the poor, ap|proach, in point of real enjoyment, much near&emacr;r to each other, than is commonly imagined. In the lot of man, mutual compe&s;ations, both of plea&s;ure and of pain, univer&s;ally take place. Providence never intend|ed that any &s;tate here &s;hould be either completely happy, or entirely mi&s;erable. If the feelings of plea|&s;ure are more numerous, and more lively, in the high|er departments of life, &s;uch al&s;o are tho&s;e of pain. If opulence increa&s;es our gratifications, it increa&s;es, in the &s;ame proportion, our de&s;ires and demands. If the poor are confined ot a more narrow circle, yet within that cir|cle lie mo&s;t of tho&s;e natural &s;atisfaction which, after all the refinements of art, are found t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t genuine
<PB N="36" REF="44">and true. In a &s;tate, therfore, where there is neither &s;o much to be coveted on the one hand, nor to be dreaded on the other, as at fi&s;t appears, how &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive ought we to be to the di&s;po&s;al of Providence! How temperate in our de&s;ires and pur&s;uits! How much more attentive to pre&s;erve our virtue, and to improve our minds, than to gain the doubtful and equivocal ad|vantages of worldly pro&s;perity!</P>
<P>When we read the hi&s;tory of nations, what do we read but the hi&s;tory of the follies and crimes of men? We may dignify tho&s;e recorded tran&s;actions, by calling them the intrigues of &s;tate&s;men, and the exploits of conquerors; but they are, in truth, no other than the efforts of di&s;content to e&s;cape from its mi&s;ery, and the &s;truggles of contending pa&s;&s;ions among unhappy men. The hi&s;tory of mankind has ever been a continued tra|gedy; the world, a great theatre, exhibiting the &s;ame repeated &s;cene, of the follies of men &s;hooting forth into guilt, and of their pa&s;&s;ions fermenting, by a quick proce&s;s, into mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But can we believe, that the nature of man came forth in this &s;tate from the hands of its gracious Crea|tor? Did he frame this world, and &s;tore it with inha|bitants, &s;olely that it might be repleni&s;hed with crimes and misfortunes? In the moral, as well as in the na|tural world, we may plainly di&s;cern the &s;igns of &s;ome violent contu&s;ion, which has &s;hattered the original workman&s;hip of the Almighty. Amid&s;t this wreck of human nature, traces &s;till remain which indicate its author. Tho&s;e high powers of con&s;cience and rea&s;on, that capacity for happine&s;s, that ardour of enterprize, that glow of affection, which often break through the gloom of human vanity and guilt, are like the &s;cattered columns, the broken arches, and defaced &s;culptures of &s;ome fallen temple, who&s;e ancient &s;plendour appears a|mid&s;t its ruins. So con&s;picuous in human nature are tho&s;e character<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters"> of a high origin and of a de|graded &s;tate, that, by many religious &s;ects throughout the earth, they have been &s;een and confe&s;&s;ed.

<HEAD><HI>On the</HI> ADVANTAGES <HI>of</HI> CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with much plea&s;ure I look back upon that phi|lo&s;ophical week which I lately enjoyed at &mdash;; as there is no part, perhaps, of &s;ocial life which affords more real &s;atisfaction than tho&s;e hours, which one pa&s;&s;es in rational and unre&s;erved conver&s;ation. The free communication of &s;entiments among&s;t a &s;et of inge|nious and &s;peculative friends, &s;uch as tho&s;e you gave me the opportunity of meeting, throws the mind into the mo&s;t advantageous exerci&s;e, and &s;hews the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of its opinions, with greater force of convic|tion than any other method we can employ.</P>
<P>That "it is not good for man to be alone," is true in more views of our &s;pecies than one; and &s;ociety gives &s;trength to our rea&s;on, as well as poli&s;h to our manners. The &s;oul, when left entirely to her own &s;o|litary contemplations, is in&s;en&s;ibly drawn by a &s;ort of con&s;titutional bias, which generally leads her opinions to the &s;ide of her inclinations. Hence it is that &s;he
<PB N="38" REF="46">contracts tho&s;e peculiarities of rea&s;oning, and little ha|bits of thinking, which &s;o often confirm her in the mo&s;t fanta&s;tical errors. But nothing is more likely to recover the mind from this fal&s;e bent, than the coun|terwarmth of impartial debate. Conver&s;ation opens our views, and gives our faculties a more vigorous play; it puts us upon turning our notions on every &s;ide, and holds them up to a light that di&s;covers tho&s;e latent flaws which would probably have lain concealed in the gloom of unagitated ab&s;traction. Accordingly, one may remark, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e wild doctrines, which have been let loo&s;e upon the world, have generally owed their birth to per&s;ons who&s;e circum&s;tances or di&s;po&s;itions have given them the fewe&s;t opportunities of canva&s;&s;ing their re&s;pective &s;y&s;tems in the way of free and friendly debate. Had the authors of many an extra|vagant hypothe&s;is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed their principles in private circles, ere they had given vent to them in public, the ob&s;ervation of Varro had never, perhaps, been made, (or never, at lea&s;t, with &s;o much ju&s;tice) that <Q>there is no opinion &s;o ab&s;urd, but has &s;ome philo&s;opher or other to produce in its &s;upport.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> GOOD-NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is &s;ubject to innumerable pains and &s;orrows by the very condition of humanity, and yet, as if nature had not &s;own evils enough in life, we are continually adding grief to grief, and aggravating the common calamity by our cruel treatment of one another. Every man's natural weight of afflictions is ftill made more heavy by the envy, malice, treachery, or inju&s;tice of his neighbour. At the &s;ame time that the &s;torm betas upon the whole &s;pecies, we are falling foul upon one another.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="47">Half the mi&s;ery of human life might be extingui&s;hed, would men alleviate the general cur&s;e they lie under, by mutual offices of compa&s;&s;ion, benevolence, and huma|nity. There is nothing therefore which we ought more to encourage in our&s;elves and others, than that di&s;po&s;i|tion of mind which in our language goes under the title of good-nature.</P>
<P>Good-nature is more agreeable in conver&s;ation than wit, and gives a certain air to the countenance which is more amiable than beauty. It &s;hews virtue in the faire&s;t light, takes off in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the de|formity of vice, and makes even folly and impertinence &s;upportable.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ociety or conver&s;ation to be kept up in the world without good-nature, or &s;omething which mu&s;t bear its appearance, and &s;upply its place. For this rea&s;on mankind have been forced to invent a kind of artificial humanity, which is what we expre&s;s by the word <HI>good-breeding.</HI> For if we examine thoroughly the idea of what we call &s;o, we &s;hall find it to be nothing el&s;e but an imitation and mimickry of good-nature, or in other terms, affability, complai&s;ance and ea&s;ine&s;s of temper reduced into an art.</P>
<P>The&s;e exterior &s;hows and appearances of humanity render a man wonderfully popular and beloved when they are founded upon a real good-nature; but without it are like hypocri&s;y in religion, or a bare form of holi|ne&s;s, which when it is di&s;covered, makes a man more dete&s;table than profe&s;&s;ed impiety.</P>
<P>Good-nature is generally born with us: Health, pro&s;|perity and kind treatment from the world are great cheri&s;hers of it where they find it: But nothing is ca|pable of forcing it up, where it does not grow of it&s;elf.

<P>FIDELIA is the only child of a decrepid father, who&s;e life is wound up in hers. This gentleman has u&s;ed Fidelia from her cradle with all the tender|ne&s;s imaginable, and has viewed her growing perfec|tions with the partiality of a parent, that &s;oon thought her accompli&s;hed above the children of all other men, but never thought &s;he was come to the utmo&s;t im|provement of which &s;he was capable. This fond|ne&s;s has had very happy effects upon his own happi|ne&s;s; for &s;he reads, &s;he dances, &s;he &s;ings, u&s;es her &s;pinet and lute to the utmo&s;t perfection: And the lady's u&s;e of all the&s;e excellencies, is to divert the old man in his ea&s;y chair, when he is free from the pangs of a chronical di&s;temper. Fidelia is now in the twenty-third year of her age; but the application of many lovers, her vigorous time of life, her quick &s;en&s;e of all that is truly gallant and elegant in the enjoyment of a plentiful fortune, are not able to draw her from the &s;ide of her good old father. Certain it is, that there is no kind of affection &s;o pure and angelic as that of a father to a daughter. He beholds her both with, and without regard to her &s;ex. In love to our wives there is de&s;ire, to our &s;ons there is ambition; but in that to our daugh|ters, there is &s;omething which there are no words to expre&s;s. Her life is de&s;igned wholly dome&s;tic, and &s;he is &s;o ready a friend a companion, that every thing that pa&s;&s;es about a man is accompanied with the idea of her pre&s;ence. Her &s;ex al&s;o is naturally &s;o much expo|&s;ed to hazard, both as to fortune and innocence, that there is perhaps a new cau&s;e of fondne&s;s ari&s;ing from that con&s;ideration al&s;o. None but fathers can have a true &s;en&s;e of the&s;e &s;ort of plea&s;ures and &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49">Fidelia, on her part, as accompli&s;hed as &s;he is; with all her beauty, wit, air and mien, employs her whole time in care and attendance upon her father. How have I been charmed to &s;ee one of the mo&s;t beautiful women the age has produced on her knees helping on an old man's &s;lipper! Her filial regard to him is what &s;he makes her diver&s;ion, her bu&s;ine&s;s, and her glory. When &s;he was a&s;ked by a friend of her decea&s;ed mother to admit of the court&s;hip of her &s;on, &s;he an&s;wered, That &s;he had a great re&s;pect and gratitude to her for the o|verture in behalf of one &s;o dear to her, but that during here father's life &s;he would admit into her heart no value for any thing that &s;hould interfere with her endeavour to make his remains of life as happy and ea&s;y as could be expected in his circum&s;tance. The lady admoni&s;h|ed her of the prime of life with a &s;mile; which Fide|lia an&s;wered with a frankne&s;s that always attends un|feigned virtue; "It is true, Madam, there are to be &s;ure very great &s;atisfactions to be expected in the com|merce of a man of honour, whom one tenderly loves; but I find &s;o much &s;atisfaction in the reflection, how much I mitigate a good man's pains, who&s;e welfare de|pends upon my a&s;&s;iduity about him, that I willingly ex|clude the loo&s;e gratifications of pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;olid re|fletions of duty. I know not whether any man's wife would be allowed, and (what I &s;till more fear) I know not whether I, a wife, &s;hould be willing to be as offici|ous as I am at pre&s;ent about my my parent." The happy father has her declaration that &s;he will not marry du|ring his life, and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing that re&s;olution not unea&s;y to her. Were one to paint filial affection in its utmo&s;t beauty, he could not have a more lively idea of it than in beholding Fidelia &s;erving her father at his hours of ri&s;ing, meals, and re&s;t.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the general crowd of female youth are con|&s;ulting their gla&s;&s;es, preparing for balls, a&s;&s;emblies, or plays; for a young lady who could be regarded among the foremo&s;t in tho&s;e places either for her per&s;on, wit, fortune, or conver&s;ation, yet to contemn all the&s;e enter|tainments,
<PB N="42" REF="50">to &s;weeten the heavy hours of a decrepid parent, is a re&s;ignation truly heroic. Fidelia performs the duty of a nur&s;e with all the beauty of a bride; nor does &s;he neglect her per&s;on, becau&s;e of her attendance on him, when he is too ill to receive company, to whom &s;he may make an appearance.</P>
<P>What adds to the entertainment of the good old man, is, that Fidelia, where merit and fortune cannot be overlooked by epi&s;tolary lovers, reads over the accounts of her conque&s;ts, plays on her &s;pinet the gaye&s;t airs, (and while &s;he is doing &s;o, you would think her formed only for gallantry) to intimate to him the plea&s;ures &s;he depi&s;es for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who think them&s;elves the pattern of good breeding and gallantry, would be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that in tho&s;e intervals when the old gentleman is at ea&s;e, and can bear company, there are at his hou&s;e in the mo&s;t regular order a&s;&s;emblies of people of the highe&s;s merit; where there is conver&s;ation without mention of the faults of the ab&s;ent, benevolence be|tween men and women without pa&s;&s;ion, and the highe&s;t &s;ubjects of morality treated of as natural and accidental di&s;cour&s;e; all which is owing to the genius of Fidelia, who at once makes her father's way to another world ea&s;y, and her&s;elf capable of being an hounour to his name in this.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="51">the natural bent of their inclinations, and without the di&s;cipline of philo&s;ophy, a&s;pire not to the heights of power and grandeur; who never &s;et their hearts upon a numerous train of clients and dependencies, nor other gay appendages of greatne&s;s; who are contented with a competency, and will not mole&s;t their tranquillity to gain an abundance: But it is not therefore to be con|cluded, that &s;uch a man is not ambitious: His de&s;ires may cut out another channel, and determine him to other pur&s;uits; the motive may be, however, &s;till the &s;ame; and in tho&s;e ca&s;es, likewi&s;e, the man may be equally pu&s;hed on with the de&s;ire of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Though the pure con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of worthy actions, ab&s;tracted from the views of popular applau&s;e, be to a generous mind an ample reward, yet the de&s;ire of di&s;|tinction was doubtle&s;s implanted in our natures as an additional incentive to exert our&s;elves in virtuous ex|cellence.</P>
<P>Ambition, therefore, is not to be confined only to on pa&s;&s;ion or pur&s;uit; for as the &s;ame humours in con&s;titution otherwi&s;e different affect the body after different manners, &s;o the &s;ame a&s;piring principle within us &s;ometimes breaks forth upon one object, &s;ometimes upon another.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but that there is as great a de|&s;ire of glory in a ring of wre&s;tlers or cudgel-players, as in any other more refined competition for &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>It is a known &s;tory of Domitian, that after he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Roman empire, his de&s;ires turned upon catching flies. Active and ma&s;culine &s;pirits, in the vigour of youth, neither can nor ought to remain at re&s;t: If they debar them&s;elves from aiming at a noble object, their de&s;ires will move downwards, and they will feel them&s;elves actuated by &s;ome low and abject pa&s;&s;ion. Thus if you cut off the top branches of a tree, and will not &s;uffer it to grow higher, it will not therefore cea&s;e to grow, but will quickly &s;hoot out at the bottom. The man indeed who goes into the world only with the narrow views of &s;elf-intere&s;t, who catches
<PB N="44" REF="52">at the applau&s;e of an idle multitude, as he can find no &s;olid contentment at the end of his journey, &s;o he de|&s;erves to meet with di&s;appointments in his way: But he who is actuated by a noble principle, who&s;e mind is &s;o far enlarged as to take in the pro&s;pect of his coun|try's good, who is enamoured with that prai&s;e which is one of the fair attendants of virtue, and values not tho&s;e acclamations which are not &s;econded by the im|partial te&s;timony of his own mind; who repines not at the low &s;tation which Providence has at pre&s;ent allotted him, but yet would willingly advance him&s;elf by ju&s;ti|fiable means to a more ri&s;ing and advantageous ground; &s;uch a man is warmed with a generous emulation; it is a virtous movement in him to wi&s;h, and to endea|vour, that his power of doing good may be equal to his will. The man who is fitted out by nature, and &s;ent into the world with great abilities, is capable of doing great good or mi&s;chief in it. It ought therefore to be the care of education, to infu&s;e into the untainted youth early notions of ju&s;tice and honour, that &s;o the po&s;&s;ible advantages of good parts may not take a bad turn, nor be perverted to ba&s;e and unworthy purpo&s;es. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion and philo&s;ophy not &s;o much to extingui&s;h our pa&s;&s;ions, as to regulate and direct them to valuable, well-cho&s;en objects. When the&s;e have pointed out to us which cour&s;e we may lawfully &s;teer, it is no harm to &s;et out all our &s;ail: If the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of adver&s;ity &s;hould ri&s;e upon us, and not &s;uffer us to make the haven where we would be, it will however prove no &s;mall con&s;olation to us in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, that we have neither mi&s;taken our cour&s;e, nor fallen into calamities of our own procuring.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> BETRAYING PRIVATE CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST all the beauties and excellencies of the ancient writers, of which I profe&s;s my&s;elf an admirer, there are none which &s;trike me with more veneration, than the precepts they have delivered to us for our conduct in &s;ociety. The fables of the poets, and the narrations of the hi&s;torians, amu&s;e and delight us with their re&s;pective qualifications; but we feel our&s;elves particularly concerned, when a moral virtue, or a &s;ocial obligation is &s;et before us, the practice of which is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty: And, perhaps, we are more ready to ob&s;erve the&s;e in&s;tructions, or at lea&s;t acquie&s;ce &s;ooner in the propriety of them, as the au|thority of the teacher is unque&s;tionable, the addre&s;s not particularly confined or levelled, and the cen&s;ure con&s;equently le&s;s dogmatical.</P>
<P>Of all the virtues which the ancients po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the zeal and fidelity of their friend&s;hips appear to me as the highe&s;t di&s;tinctions of their characters. Private per&s;ons, and particular affinities among&s;t them, have been long celebrated and admired; and if we examine their conduct as companions, we &s;hall find, that the rites of their religion were not more &s;acred, more &s;trongly ratified, nor more &s;everely pre&s;erved, than their laws of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The table of friend&s;hip, and the altar of &s;acrifice, were equally uncontaminated: The my&s;teries of Bacchus were enveloped with as many leaves as tho&s;e of Ceres; and the profanation of either deity, excluded the offenders from the a&s;&s;emblies of men: The revealer was judged accur&s;ed, and impiety was thought to ac|company his &s;tep.</P>
<P>Without inveighing again&s;t the practice of the pre|&s;ent, times, or comparing it with that of the pa&s;t, I &s;hall
<PB N="46" REF="54">only remark, that if we cannot meet together upon the hone&s;t principles of &s;ocial beings, there is rea&s;on to fear that we are placed in the mo&s;t unfortunate and lament|able aera &s;ince the creation of mankind. It is not the increa&s;e of vices in&s;eparable from humanity that alarms us, the riots of the licentious, or the outrages of the profligate; but it is the ab&s;ence of that integrity, the neglect of that virtue, the contempt of that honour, which by connecting individuals formed &s;ociety, and without which &s;ociety can no longer exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Few men are calculated for that clo&s;e connection, which we di&s;tingui&s;h by the appellation of friend&s;hip; and we well know the difference between a friend and an acquaintance: The acquaintance is in a po&s;t of pro|gre&s;&s;ion; and after having pa&s;&s;ed through a cour&s;e of proper experience, and given &s;ufficient evidence of his merit, takes a new title, and ranks him&s;elf higher. He mu&s;t now be con&s;idered as in a place of con&s;e|quence; in which all the ornaments of our nature are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport him. But the great requi&s;ites, tho&s;e without which all others are u&s;ele&s;s, are fidelity and taciturnity. He mu&s;t not only be &s;uperior to lo|quacious imbecility, he mu&s;t be well able to repre&s;s the attacks of curio&s;ity, and to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e powerful engines that will be employed again&s;t him, wine and re&s;entment. Such are the powers that he mu&s;t con&s;tantly exert, after a tru&s;t is repo&s;ed in him: And that he may not overload him&s;elf, let him not add to his charge, by his own enquiries; let it be a devolved, not an acquired commi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>There are as few in&s;tigations in this country to a breach of confidence, as &s;incerity can rejoice under. The betrayer is for ever &s;hut out from the ways of men, and his di&s;coveries are deemed the effects of ma|lice. We wi&s;ely imagine, he mu&s;t be actuated by other
<PB N="47" REF="55">motives than the promulgation of truth; and we receive his evidence, however we may u&s;e it, with contempt.

<P>AT the &s;iege of Namur by the allies, there were in the ranks of the company commanded by captian Pincent, in colonel Frederic Hamilton's regiment, one Unnion, a corporal, and one Valentine, a private cen|tinel: There happened a di&s;pute between the&s;e two men about an affair of love, which, upon &s;ome aggrava|tions, grew to an irreconcileable hatred.

The centinel bore it without re&s;i&s;t|ance; but frequently &s;aid, he would die to be revenged of that tyrant.

<P>THE &s;oldiers, after the taking of New Carthage, brought before Scipio a young lady of &s;uch di&s;|tingui&s;hed beauty, that &s;he attracted the eyes of all wherever &s;he went. Scipio, by enquiring concerning her country and parents, among other things learned, that &s;he was betrothed to Allucius, prince of the Cel|tiberians. He immediately ordered her parents and bridegroom to be &s;ent for. In the mean time he was informed, that the young prince was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively enamoured of his bride, that he could not &s;urvive the lo&s;s of her. For this rea&s;on, as &s;oon as he appeared, and before he &s;poke to her parents, he took great care to talk with him. "As you and I are both young," &s;aid he, <Q>we can conver&s;e together with greater free|dom. When your bride, who had fallen into the hands of my &s;oldiers, was brought before me, I was informed that you loved her pa&s;&s;ionately; and, in truth, her perfect beauty left me no room to doubt of it. If I were at liberty to indulge a youthful pa&s;&s;ion, I mean honourable and lawful wedlock, and were not &s;olely engro&s;&s;ed by the affairs of my republic, I might have hoped to have been pardoned my exce&s;&s;ive love for &s;o charming a mi&s;tre&s;s. But as I am &s;ituated, and have it in my power, with plea&s;ure I promote you happine&s;s. Your future &s;pou&s;e has met with as civil and mode&s;t treatment from me, as if &s;he had been among&s;t her own pa|rents, who are &s;oon to be your too. I have kept her pure, in order to have it in my power to make you a pre&s;ent worthy of you and of me. The only return I a&s;k of you for this favour is, that you will be a friend to the Roman people; and that if you believe me to be a man of worth, as the &s;tates of

Then the pa|rents and relations of the virgin were called. They had brought a great &s;um of money to ran&s;om her.

<HEAD>ALCANDER <HI>and</HI> SEPTIMIUS.</HEAD>
<P>ATHENS, long after the decline of the Roman empire, &s;till continued the &s;eat of learning, politene&s;s, and wi&s;dom. Theodoric, the O&s;trogoth, re|paired the &s;chools which barbarity was &s;uffering to fall into decay, and continued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septimius were fellow-&s;tudents together. The one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the Lyceum; the other, the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot a friend&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world; for Al|cander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when Alcander, after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of youth in the indolence of philo&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and as a &s;tep pre|vious to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nup|tials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were per|formed; and nothing now remained but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>Alcander's exultation in his own happine&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to in|troduce Hypatia to his fellow &s;tudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equal|ly happy in friend&s;hip and love. But this was an in|terview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septi|mius no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion; and though he u&s;ed every effort
<PB N="54" REF="62">to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and &s;o unju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;i|cians judged incurable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend&s;hip. The &s;aga|city of the phy&s;icians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered that the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; and Alcander being apprized of their di&s;covery, at length extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the con|flict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of Alcan|der on this occa&s;ion; it is enough to &s;ay, that the A|thenians were at that time arrived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his in|tended bride in all her charms to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked for change of fortune wrought as unex|pected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t dignities of the &s;tate, and was con&s;tituted the city-judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alcander not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him by the relations of Hypatia, for having ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to with&s;tand the influ|ence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;t, and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions were confi&s;cated, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the
<PB N="55" REF="63">habit of freedom, expo&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purcha&s;er, Al|cander, with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into that region of de&s;olation and &s;terility. His &s;tated employment was to follow the herds of an im|perious ma&s;ter, and his &s;ucce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he em|braced it with ardour; &s;o that, travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived in Rome. The &s;ame day on which Al|cander arrived, Septimius &s;at admini&s;tering ju&s;tice in the Forum, whither our wanderer came, expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and publicly acknowledged by his former friend. Here he &s;tood the whole day among&s;t the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and ex|pecting to be taken notice of; but he was &s;o much al|tered by along &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he continued unnoticed among&s;t the re&s;t; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found him|&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretchedne&s;s; and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be attended with interruption or danger: In &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty, and de&s;pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries for a while in &s;leep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ea&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers
<PB N="56" REF="64">came to make this their retreat; but happening to di&s;|agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a farther enquiry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined; and Alcander was apprehended, and accu&s;ed of robbery and murder. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appearance confirmed &s;u&s;picion. Misfortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became regardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;ehood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no defence; and, thus lowering with re&s;olution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. As the proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceed|ing to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was &s;oon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;elling his plunder, and, &s;truck with a panic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and acquitted every other per&s;on of any partner&s;hip in his guilt. Al|cander's innocence therefore appeared, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct remained a wonder to the &s;ur|rounding multitude; but their a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till farther encrea&s;ed when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from his tribunal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal: Septi|mius recollected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the &s;equel be related? Alcander was acquitted; &s;hared the friend&s;hip and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived afterwards in happine&s;s and ea&s;e; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circum|&s;tances are &s;o de&s;perate which Providence may not relieve.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> HILL <HI>of</HI> SCIENCE; <HI>a</HI> VISION.</HEAD>
<P>IN that &s;ea&s;on of the year when the &s;erenity of the &s;ky, the various fruits which cover the ground, the di&s;coloured foliage of the trees, and all the &s;weet, but fading graces of in&s;piring autumn, open the mind to benevolence, and di&s;po&s;e it for contemplation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curio&s;ity began to give way to wearine&s;s; and I &s;at me down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with mo&s;s, where the ru&s;tling of the falling leaves, the da&s;h|ing of waters, and the hum of the di&s;tant city, &s;oothed my mind into the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity, and &s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me, as I was indulging the agreea|ble reveries which the objects around me naturally in|&s;pired.</P>
<P>I immediately found my&s;elf in a va&s;t extended plain, in the middle of which aro&s;e a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom pre&s;&s;ed forwards with the livelie&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of ardour in their countenance, though the way was in many places &s;teep and difficult. I ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who had but ju&s;t begun to climb the hill thought them&s;elves not far from the top; but as they proceeded, new hills were continually ri&s;ing to their view, and the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t they could before di&s;cern &s;eemed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to lo&s;e it&s;elf in the clouds. As I was gazing on the&s;e things with a&s;toni&s;hment, my good genius &s;uddenly appear|ed. The mountain before thee, &s;aid he, is the Hill of Science. On the top is the Temple of Truth, who&s;e head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of her votaries; be &s;ilent and attentive.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="66">I &s;aw that the only regular approach to the mountain was by a gate, called the Gate of Languages. It was kept by a woman of a pen&s;ive and thoughtful appear|ance, who&s;e lips were continually moving, as though &s;he repeated &s;omething to her&s;elf. Her name was Memory. On entering this fir&s;t inclo&s;ure, I was &s;tun|ned with a confu&s;ed murmur of jarring voices, and di&s;|&s;onant &s;ounds; which increa&s;ed upon me to &s;uch a de|gree, that I was utterly confounded, and could compare the noi&s;e to nothing but the confu&s;ion of tongues at Babel. The road was al&s;o rough and &s;tony; and ren|dered more difficult by heaps of rubbi&s;h continually tumbled down from the higher parts of the mountain; and broken ruins of ancient buildings, which the tra|vellers were obliged to climb over at every &s;tep; in&s;o|much that many, di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o rough a beginning, turned back, and attempted the mountain no more: While others, having conquered this difficulty, had not &s;pirits to a&s;cend further, and &s;itting down on &s;ome rubbi&s;h, harangued the multitude below with the great|e&s;t marks of importance and &s;elf-complacency.</P>
<P>About half way up the hill, I ob&s;erved on each &s;ide of the path a thick fore&s;t covered with continual fogs, and cut out into labyrinths, cro&s;s alleys, and &s;erpentine walks, entangled with thorns and briars. This was called the Wood of Error; and I heard the voices of many who were lo&s;t up and down in it, calling to one another, and endeavouring in vain to extricate them|&s;elves. The trees in many places &s;hot their boughs over the path, and a thick mi&s;t often re&s;ted on it; yet never &s;o much but that it was di&s;cernible by the light which beamed from the countenance of Truth.</P>
<P>In the plea&s;ante&s;t part of the mountain were placed the bowers of the Mu&s;es, who&s;e office it was to cheer the &s;pirits of the travellers, and encourage their faint|ing &s;teps with &s;ongs from their divine harps.</P>
<P>After I had ob&s;erved the&s;e things, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the &s;teep a&s;cent, and ob&s;erved among&s;t them a youth of a lively
<PB N="59" REF="67">look, a piercing eye, and &s;omething fiery and irregular in all his motions. His name was Genius. He darted like an eagle up the mountain, and left his companions gazing after him with envy and admiration; but his progre&s;s was unequal, and interrupted by a thou&s;and caprices. When Plea&s;ure warbled in the valley, he mingled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious and untried paths; and made &s;o many excur&s;ions from the road, that his feebler com|panions often out&s;tripped him. I ob&s;erved that the Mu&s;es beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned, and turned a&s;ide her face. While Genius was thus wa&s;ting his &s;trength in eccentric flights, I &s;aw a per&s;on of a very different appearance, named Appli|cation. He crept along with a &s;low and unremitting pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patient|ly removing every &s;tone that ob&s;tructed his way, till he &s;aw mo&s;t of tho&s;e below him who had at fir&s;t derided his &s;low and toil&s;ome progre&s;s. Indeed there were few who a&s;cended the hill with equal and uninterrupted &s;teadine&s;s; for, be&s;ide the difficulties of the way, they were continually &s;olicited to turn a&s;ide by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Plea&s;ures, who&s;e im|portunity, when they had once complied with, they became le&s;s and le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t; and though they often returned to the path, the a&s;perities of the road were more &s;everely felt, the hill appeared more &s;teep and rugged, the fruits which were whole&s;ome and re|fre&s;hing &s;eemed har&s;h and ill-ta&s;ted, their &s;ight grew dim, and their feet tript at every little ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;aw, with &s;ome &s;urprize, that the Mu&s;es, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to cheer and encourage tho&s;e who were toiling up the a&s;cent, would often &s;ing in the bowers of Plea&s;ure, and accompany tho&s;e who were enticed away at the call of the Pa&s;&s;ions; they accompanied them however, but a little way, and always for&s;ook them when they lo&s;t &s;ight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives,
<PB N="60" REF="68">and led them away, without re&s;i&s;tance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the man&s;ions of Mi&s;ery. Among&s;t the innumerable &s;educers, who were endeavouring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one &s;o little formidable in her appearance, and &s;o gentle and languid in her attempts, that I &s;hould &s;carcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers &s;he had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. Indo|lence (for &s;o &s;he was called) far from proceeding to open ho&s;tilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented her&s;elf with retarding their pro|gre&s;s; and the purpo&s;e &s;he could not force them to a|bandon, &s;he per&s;uaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which withered the &s;trength of tho&s;e who came within its influence. Her unhappy captives &s;till turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground &s;eemed to &s;lide from beneath their feet, and they found them&s;elves at the bottom, before they &s;u&s;|pected they had changed their place. The placid &s;e|renity which at fir&s;t appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom, as they glided down the &s;tream of In&s;ignificance; a dark and &s;luggi&s;h water which is curled by no breeze, and en|livened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead &s;ea, where the &s;tartled pa&s;&s;engers are awakened by the &s;hock, and the next moment burried in the gulf of Oblivion.</P>
<P>Of all the unhappy de&s;erters from the paths of Sci|ence, none &s;eemed le&s;s able to return than the followers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite and Pa&s;&s;ion could often &s;eize the moment when their tyrants were languid or a&s;leep to e&s;cape from their enchantment; but the dominion of Indolence was con&s;tant and unre|mitted, and &s;eldom re&s;i&s;ted, till re&s;i&s;tance was in vain.</P>
<P>After contemplating the&s;e things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was always pure and exhilarating, the path &s;haded with laurels and other ever-greens, and the effulgence which
<PB N="61" REF="69">beamed from the face of the godde&s;s, &s;eemed to &s;hed a glory round her votaries. Happy, &s;aid I, are they who are permitted to a&s;cend the mountain!&mdash;but while I was pronouncing this exclamation with uncommon ardour, I &s;aw &s;tanding be&s;ide me a form of diviner features and a more benign radiance. Happer, &s;aid &s;he, are tho&s;e whom Virtue conducts to the man&s;ions of Content! What, &s;aid I, does Virtue then re&s;ide in the vale? I am found, &s;aid &s;he, in the vale, and I illu|minate the mountain: I cheer the cottager at his toil, and in&s;pire the &s;age at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities, and ble&s;s the hermit in his cell. I have a temple in every heart that owns my influence; and to him that wi&s;hes for me I am already pre&s;ent. Sci|ence may rai&s;e you to eminence, but I alone can guide you to felicity! While the godde&s;s was thus &s;peaking I &s;tretched out my arms towards her with a vehemence which broke my &s;lumbers. The chill dews were fall|ing around me, and the &s;hades of evening &s;tretched over the land&s;cape. I ha&s;tened homeward, and re|&s;igned the night to &s;ilence and meditation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> CRUELTY <HI>to</HI> ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>MONTAIGNE thinks it &s;ome reflection upon human nature it&s;elf, that few people take de|light in &s;eeing bea&s;ts care&s;s or play together, but almo&s;t every one is plea&s;ed to &s;ee them lacerate and worry one another. I am &s;orry this temper is become al|mo&s;t a di&s;tingui&s;hing character of our own nation, from the ob&s;ervation which is made by foreigners of our beloved pa&s;times, bear-baiting, cock-fighting, and the like. We &s;hould find it hard to vindicate the de&s;|troying any thing that has life, merely out of wan|tonnne&s;s: Yet in this principle our children are bred
<PB N="62" REF="70">up; and one of the fir&s;t plea&s;ures we allow them, is the licence of inflicting pain upon poor animals: Almo&s;t as &s;oon as we are &s;en&s;ible what life is our&s;elves, we make it our &s;port to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good u&s;e might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and in&s;ects. Mr Locke takes notice of a mother who permitted them to her children, but rewarded or puni&s;hed them as they treat|ed them well or ill. This was no other than entering them betimes into a daily exerci&s;e of humanity, and improving their very diver&s;ion to a virtue.</P>
<P>I fancy, too, &s;ome advantage might be taken of the common notion, that 'tis ominous or unlucky to de&s;|troy &s;ome &s;orts of birds, as &s;wallows and martins. This opinion might po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the confidence the&s;e birds &s;eem to put in us by building under our roofs; &s;o that it is a kind of violation of the laws of ho&s;pitality to murder them. As for Robin-red-brea&s;ts in particular, it is not improbable they owe their &s;ecu|rity to the old ballad of "The children in the wood." However it be, I don't know, I &s;ay, why this prejudice, well improved and carried as far as it would go, might not be made to conduce to the pre&s;ervation of many innocent creatures, which are now expo&s;ed to all the wantonne&s;s of an ignorant barbarity.</P>
<P>There are other animals that have the misfortune, for no manner of rea&s;on, to be treated as common ene|mies, wherever found. The conceit that a cat has nine lives, has co&s;t at lea&s;t nine lives in ten of the whole race of them: Scarce a boy in the &s;treet but has, in this point, outdone Hercules him&s;elf, who was famous for killing a mon&s;ter that had but three lives. Whe|ther the unaccountable animo&s;ity again&s;t this u&s;eful dome&s;tic may be any cau&s;e of the general per&s;ecution of owls (who are a &s;ort of feathered cats) or whether it be only an unrea&s;onable pique the moderns have taken to a &s;erious countenance, I &s;hall not determine: Tho' I am inclined to believe the former; &s;ince I ob&s;erve the &s;ole rea&s;on alleged for the de&s;truction of frogs is
<PB N="63" REF="71">becau&s;e they are like toads. Yet, amid&s;t all the mis|fortunes of the&s;e unfriended creatures, 'tis &s;ome hap|pine&s;s that we have not yet taken a fancy to eat them: For &s;hould our countrymen refine upon the French never &s;o little, 'tis not to be conceived to what unheard-of torments, owls, cats, and frogs, may be yet re&s;erved.</P>
<P>When we grow up to men, we have another &s;ucce&s;|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;anguinary &s;ports; in particular, hunting. I dare not attack a diver&s;ion which has &s;uch authority and cu&s;tom to &s;upport it; but mu&s;t have leave to be of opinion, that the agitation of that exerci&s;e, with the example and number of the cha&s;ers, not a little contribute to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e checks, which compa&s;&s;ion would naturally &s;ugge&s;t in behalf of the animal pur&s;u|ed. Nor &s;hall I &s;ay, with Mon&s;ieur Fleury, that this &s;port is a remain of the Gothic barbarity; but I mu&s;t animadvert upon a certain cu&s;tom yet in u&s;e with us, and barbarous enough to be derived from the Goths, or even the Scythians: I mean that &s;avage compliment our hunt&s;men pa&s;t upon ladies of quality, who are pre|&s;ent at the death of a &s;tag, when they put the knife in their hands to cut the throat of a helple&s;s, trembling, and weeping creature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> ENVY.</HEAD>
<P>ENVY is almo&s;t the only vice which is practicable at all times, and in every place; the only pa&s;&s;ion which can never lie quiet for want of irritation; its ef|fects, therefore, are every where di&s;coverable, and its attempts always to be dreaded.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to mention a name, which any ad|vantageous di&s;tinction has made eminent, but &s;ome la|tent animo&s;ity will bur&s;t out. The wealthy trader, however he may ab&s;tract him&s;elf from public affairs,
<PB N="64" REF="72">will never want tho&s;e who hint with Shylock, that &s;hips are but boards, and that no man can properly be term|ed rich who&s;e fortune is at the mercy of the winds. The beauty adorned only with the unambitious graces of innocence and mode&s;ty, provokes, whenever &s;he ap|pears, a thou&s;and murmurs of detraction, and whi&s;pers of &s;u&s;picion. The genius, even when he endeavours only to entertain with plea&s;ing images of nature, or in|&s;truct by unconte&s;ted principles of &s;cience, yet &s;uffers per&s;ecution from innumerable critics, who&s;e acrimony is excited merely by the pain of &s;eeing others plea&s;ed, of hearing applau&s;es which another enjoys.</P>
<P>The frequency of envy makes it &s;o familiar, that it e&s;capes our not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce; nor do we often reflect upon its turpitude or malignity, till we happen to feel its influ|ence. When he that has given no provocation to ma|lice, but by attempting to excel in &s;ome u&s;eful art, finds him&s;elf pur&s;ued, by multitudes whom he never &s;aw, with implacability of per&s;onal re&s;entment; when he perceives clamour and malice let loo&s;e upon him as a public enemy, and incited by every &s;tratagem of defa|mation; when he hears the misfortunes of his family, or the follies of his youth, expo&s;ed to the world; and every failure of conduct, or defect of nature, aggravated and ridiculed; he then learns to abhor tho&s;e artifices at which he only laughed before, and di&s;covers how much the happine&s;s of life would be advanced by the eradication of envy from the human heart.</P>
<P>Envy is, indeed, a &s;tubborn weed of the mind, and &s;eldom yields to the culture of philo&s;ophy. There are, however, con&s;iderations, which, if carefully implanted, and diligently propagated, might in time overpower and repre&s;s it, &s;ince no one can nur&s;e it for the &s;ake of plea&s;ure, as its effects are only &s;hame, angui&s;h, and perturbation.</P>
<P>It is, above all other vices, incon&s;i&s;tent with the cha|racter of a &s;ocial being, becau&s;e it &s;acrifices truth and kindne&s;s to very weak temptations. He that plunders a wealthy neighbour, gains as much as he takes away,
<PB N="56" REF="73">and improves his own condition, in the &s;ame propor|tion as he impairs another's; but he that bla&s;ts a flouri&s;hing reputation, mu&s;t be content with a &s;mall dividend of additional fame, &s;o &s;mall as can afford very little con&s;olation to balance the guilt by which it is obtained.</P>
<P>I have hitherto avoided mentioning that dangerous and empirical morality, which cures one vice by means of another. But envy is &s;o ba&s;e and dete&s;table, &s;o vile in its original, and &s;o pernicious in its effects, that the predominance of almo&s;t any other quality is to be de|&s;ired. It is one of tho&s;e lawle&s;s enemies of &s;ociety, again&s;t which poi&s;oned arrows may hone&s;tly be u&s;ed. Let it it therefore be con&s;tantly remembered, that who|ever envies another, confe&s;&s;es his &s;uperiority; and let tho&s;e be reformed by their pride, who have lo&s;t their virtue.</P>
<P>It is no &s;light aggravation of the injuries which envy incites, that they are committed again&s;t tho&s;e who have given no intentional provocation; and that the &s;ufferer is marked out for ruin, not becau&s;e he has failed in any duty, but becau&s;e he has dared to do more than was required.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every other crime is practi&s;ed by the help of &s;ome quality which might have produced e&s;teem or love, if it had been well employed; but envy is a more unmixed and genuine evil; it pur&s;ues a hateful end by de&s;picable means, and de&s;ires not &s;o much its own hap|pine&s;s as another's mi&s;ery. To avoid depravity like this, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that any one &s;hould a&s;pire to heroi&s;m or &s;anctity; but only, that he &s;hould re&s;olve not to quit the rank which nature a&s;&s;igns, and wi&s;h to maintain the dignity of a human being.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LEARNING</HI> &s;hould be &s;ometimes applied to cultivate our <HI>MORALS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ENVY, curio&s;ity, and our &s;en&s;e of the imperfection of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, inclines us always to e&s;timate the advantages which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others above their real value. Every one mu&s;t have remarked what powers and prerogatives the vulgar imagine to be conferred by learning. A man of &s;cience is expected to excel the unlettered and unenlightened, even on oc|ca&s;ions where literature is of no u&s;e, and among weak minds lo&s;es part of his reverence by di&s;covering no &s;u|periority in tho&s;e parts of life, in which all are una|voidably equal; as when a monarch makes a progre&s;s to the remoter provinces, the ru&s;tics are &s;aid &s;ome|times to wonder that they find him of the &s;ame &s;ize with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e demands of prejudice and folly can never be &s;atisfied, and therefore many of the imputations which learning &s;uffers from di&s;appointed ignorance, are with|out reproach. Yet it cannot be denied, that there are &s;ome failures to which men of &s;tudy are peculiarly ex|po&s;ed. Every condition has its di&s;advantages. The circle of knowledge is too wide for the mo&s;t active and diligent intellect, and while &s;cience is pur&s;ued with ardour, other accompli&s;hments of equal u&s;e are nece&s;|&s;arily neglected; as a &s;mall garri&s;on mu&s;t leave one part of an exten&s;ive fortre&s;s naked, when an alarm calls them to another.</P>
<P>The learned, however, might generally &s;upport their dignity with more &s;ucce&s;s, if they &s;uffered not them|&s;elves to be mi&s;led by &s;uperfluous attainments of quali|fications which few can under&s;tand or value, and by &s;kill which they may &s;ink into the grave without any
<PB N="67" REF="75">con&s;picuous opportunities of exerting. Raphael, in return to Adam's enquiries into the cour&s;es of the &s;tars and the revolutions of heaven, coun&s;els him to with|draw his mind from idle &s;peculations, and, in&s;tead of watching motions which he has no power to regulate, to employ his faculties upon nearer and more intere&s;t|ing objects, the &s;urvey of his pa&s;&s;ions, the knowledge of duties which mu&s;t daily be performed, and the de|tection of dangers which mu&s;t daily be incurred.</P>
<P>This angelic coun&s;el every man of letters &s;hould al|ways have before him. He that devotes him&s;elf whol|ly to retired &s;tudy, naturally &s;inks from omi&s;&s;ion to for|getfulne&s;s of &s;ocial duties, and from which he mu&s;t be &s;ometimes awakened, and recalled to the general con|dition of mankind.</P>
<P>So many hindrances many ob&s;truct the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, that there is little rea&s;on for wondering that it is in a few hands. To the greater part of man|kind the duties of life are incon&s;i&s;tent with much &s;tudy, and the hours which they would &s;pend upon letters mu&s;t be &s;tolen from their occupations and their fami|lies. Many &s;uffer them&s;elves to be lured by more &s;prightly and luxuriant plea&s;ures from the &s;hades of contemplation, where they find &s;eldom more than a calm delight, &s;uch as, though greater than all others, if its certainty and its duration be reckoned with its power of gratification, is yet ea&s;ily quitted for &s;ome ex|temporary joy, which the pre&s;ent moment offers, and another perhaps will put out of reach.</P>
<P>It is the great excellence of learning that it borrows very little from time or place; it is not confined to &s;ea&s;on or climate, to cities or to the country, but may be cultivated and enjoyed where no other plea&s;ure can be obtained. But this quality, which con&s;titutes much of its value, is one occa&s;ion of neglect; what may be done at all times with equal propriety, is deferred from day to day, till the mind is gradually reconciled to the omi&s;&s;ion, and the attention is turned to other objects. Thus habitual idlene&s;s gains too much power to be

<HEAD>The two <HI>BEES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON a fine morning in May, two bees &s;et forward in que&s;t of honey; the one wi&s;e and temperate, the other carele&s;s and extravagant. They &s;oon arrived at a garden enriched with aromatic herbs, the mo&s;t fragrant flowers, and the mo&s;t delicious fruits. They regaled them&s;elves for a time on the various dainties that were &s;pread before them: The one loading his thigh at intervals with provi&s;ions for the hive again&s;t the di&s;tant winter; the other revelling in &s;weets, with|out regard to any thing but his pre&s;ent gratification. At length they found a wide-mouthed phial, that hung beneath the bough of a peach-tree, filled with honey ready tempered, and expo&s;ed to their ta&s;te in the mo&s;t alluring manner. The thoughtle&s;s epicure, &s;pite of all his friend's remon&s;trances, plunged headlong into the ve&s;&s;el, re&s;olving to indulge him&s;elf in all the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;uality. The philo&s;opher, on the other hand, &s;ipped a little with caution; but being &s;u&s;picious of
<PB N="69" REF="77">danger, flew off to fruits and flowers; where by the moderation of his meals, he improved his reli&s;h for the true enjoyment of them. In the evening, however, he called upon his friend, to enquire whether he would return to the hive; but found him &s;urfeited in &s;weets, which he was as unable to leave, as to enjoy. Clogged in his wings, enfeebled in his feet, and his whole frame totally enervated, he was but ju&s;t able to bid his friend adieu, and to lament with his late&s;t breath, that, though a ta&s;te of plea&s;ure might quicken the reli&s;h of life, an unre&s;trained indulgence is inevitable de&s;truction.</P>

<HEAD>On <HI>CRUELTY</HI> to inferior <HI>ANIMALS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAN is that link of the chain of univer&s;al exi&s;t|ence by which &s;piritual and corporeal beings are united: As the numbers and variety of the latter his inferiors are almo&s;t infinite, &s;o probably are tho&s;e of the former his &s;uperiors; and as we &s;ee that the lives and happine&s;s of tho&s;e below us are dependent on our wills, we may rea&s;onably conclude, that our lives and happine&s;s are equally dependent on the wills of tho&s;e above us; accountable, like our&s;elves, for the u&s;e of this power, to the Supreme Creator, and Governor of all things. Should this analogy be well founded, how criminal will our account appear, when laid before that ju&s;t and impartial Judge! How will man, that &s;anguinary tyrant, be able to excu&s;e him&s;elf from the charge of tho&s;e innumerable cruelties inflicted on his unoffending &s;ubjects committed to his care, formed for his benefit, and placed under his authority by their com|mon Father? who&s;e mercy is over all his works, and who expects that his authority &s;hould be exerci&s;ed not only with tenderne&s;s and mercy, but in conformity to the laws of ju&s;tice and gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="78">But to what horrid deviations from the&s;e benevolent intentions are we daily witne&s;&s;es! No &s;mall part of mankind derive their chief amu&s;ements from the deaths and &s;ufferings of inferior animals; a much greater, con&s;ider them only as engines of wood, or iron, u&s;eful in their &s;everal occupations. The carman drives his hor&s;e, and the carpenter his nail, by repeated blows; and &s;o long as the&s;e produce the de&s;ired effect, and they both go, they neither reflect nor care whether either of them have any &s;en&s;e of feeling. The butcher knocks down the &s;tately ox, with no more compa&s;&s;ion than the black&s;mith hammers a hor&s;e-&s;hoe; and plunges his knife into the throat of the innocent lamb, with as little reluctance as the taylor &s;ticks his needle into the collar of a coat.</P>
<P>If there are &s;ome few, who, formed in a &s;ofter mould, view with pity the &s;ufferings of the&s;e defence|le&s;s creatures, there is &s;carce one who entertains the lea&s;t idea, that ju&s;tice or gratitude can be due to their merits, or their &s;ervices. The &s;ocial and friendly dog is hanged without remor&s;e, if, by barking in defence of his ma&s;ter's per&s;on and property, he happens un|knowingly to di&s;turb his re&s;t: The generous hor&s;e, who has carried his ungrateful ma&s;ter for many years with ea&s;e and &s;afety, worn out with age and infirmities, contracted in his &s;ervice, is by him condemned to end his mi&s;erable days in a du&s;t-cart, where the more he exerts his little remains of &s;pirit, the more he is whip|ped, to &s;ave his &s;tupid driver the trouble of whipping &s;ome other le&s;s obedient to the la&s;h. Sometimes, hav|ing been taught the practice of many unnatural and u&s;ele&s;s feats in a riding-hou&s;e, he is at la&s;t turned out, and con&s;igned to the dominion of hackney-coachman, by whom he is every day corrected for performing tho&s;e tricks, which he had learned under &s;o long and &s;evere a di&s;cipline. The &s;luggi&s;h bear, in contradiction to his nature, is taught to dance, for the diver&s;ion of a malignant mob, by placing red-hot irons under his feet: And the maje&s;tic bull is tortured by every mode
<PB N="71" REF="79">which malice can invent, for no offence, but that he is gentle, and unwilling to a&s;&s;ail his diabolical tormentors. The&s;e, with innumerable other acts of cruelty, inju&s;tice, and ingratitude, are every day committed, not only with impunity, but without cen&s;ure, and even without ob&s;ervation; but we may be a&s;&s;ured, that they cannot finally pa&s;s away unnoticed and unretaliated.</P>
<P>The laws of &s;elf-defence undoubtedly ju&s;tify us in de&s;troying tho&s;e animals which would de&s;troy us, who injure our properties, or annoy our per&s;ons; but not even the&s;e, whenever their &s;ituation incapacitates them from hurting us. I know of no right which we have to &s;hoot at a bear on an inacce&s;&s;ible i&s;land of ice, or an eagle on the mountain's top; who&s;e lives cannot injure us, nor deaths procure us any benefit. We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not wantonly to take it away from the meane&s;t in&s;ect, without &s;ufficient rea&s;on; they all receive it from the &s;ame benevolent hand as our&s;elves, and have therefore an equal right to enjoy it.</P>
<P>God has been plea&s;ed to create numberle&s;s animals intended for our &s;u&s;tenance; and that they are &s;o in|tended, the agreeable flavour of their fle&s;h to our palates, and the whole&s;ome nutriment which it admini&s;ters to our &s;tomachs, are &s;ufficient proofs: The&s;e, as they are formed for our u&s;e, propagated by our culture, and fed by our care, we have certainly a right to deprive of life, becau&s;e it is given and pre&s;erved to them on that con|dition; but this &s;hould always be performed with all the tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion which &s;o di&s;agreeable an office will permit; and no circum&s;tances ought to be omitted, which can render their executions as quick and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. For this, Providence has wi&s;ely and benevolently provided, by forming them in &s;uch a manner, that their fle&s;h becomes rancid and unpalata|ble by a painful and lingering death; and has thus compelled us to be merciful without compa&s;&s;ion, and cautious of their &s;uffering, for the &s;ake of our&s;elves: But, if there are any who&s;e ta&s;tes are &s;o vitiated, and
<PB N="72" REF="80">who&s;e hearts are &s;o hardened, as to delight in &s;uch in|human &s;acrifices, and to partake of them without re|mor&s;e, they &s;hould be looked upon as daemons in hu|man &s;hapes, and expect a retaliation of tho&s;e tortures which they have inflicted on the innocent, for the gratification of their own depraved and unnatural ap|petites.</P>
<P>So violent are the pa&s;&s;ions of anger and revenge in the human brea&s;t, that it is not wonderful that men &s;hould per&s;ecute their real or imaginary enemies with cruelty and malevolence; but that there &s;hould exi&s;t in nature a being who can receive plea&s;ure from giving pain, would be totally incredible, if we were not con|vinced, by melancholy experience, that there are not only many, but that this unaccountable di&s;po&s;ition is in &s;ome manner inherent in the nature of man; for, as he cannot be taught by example, nor led to it by temp|tation, or prompted to it by intere&s;t, it mu&s;t be derived from his native con&s;titution; and is a remarkable con|firmation of what revelation &s;o frequently inculcates&mdash;that he brings into the world with him an original de|pravity, the effects of a fallen and degenerate &s;tate; in proof of which we need only ob&s;erve, that the nearer he approaches to a &s;tate of nature, the more predomi|nant this di&s;po&s;ition appears, and the more violently it operates. We &s;ee children laughing at the mi&s;eries which they inflict on every unfortunate animal which comes within their power; all &s;avages are ingenious in contriving, and happy in executing the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures; and the common people of all countries are delighted with nothing &s;o much as bull-baitings, prize-fightings, executions, and all &s;pectacles of cruelty and horror. Though civilization may in &s;ome degree abate this native ferocity, it can never quite extirpate it; the mo&s;t poli&s;hed are not a&s;hamed to be plea&s;ed with &s;cenes of little le&s;s barbarity, and, to the di&s;grace of human nature, to dignify them with the name of &s;ports. They arm cocks with artificial weapons, which nature had kindly denied to their malevolence, and, with &s;houts of
<PB N="73" REF="81">applau&s;e and triumph, &s;ee them plunge them into each other's hearts: They view with delight the trembling deer and defencele&s;s hare, flying for hours in the ut|mo&s;t agonies of terror and de&s;pair, and at la&s;t, &s;inking under fatigue, devoured, by their mercile&s;s pur&s;uers: They &s;ee with joy the beautiful phea&s;ant and harmle&s;s partridge drop from their flight, weltering in their blood, or perhaps peri&s;hing with wounds and hunger, under the cover of &s;ome friendly thicket, to which they have in vain retreated for &s;afety: They triumph over the un&s;u&s;pecting fi&s;h, whom they have decoyed by an in&s;idious pretence of feeding, and drag him from his native element by a hook fixed to and tearing out his entrails: And, to add to all this, they &s;pare neither labour not expence to pre&s;erve and propagate the&s;e in|nocent animals, for no other end but to multiply the objects of their per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>What name &s;hould we be&s;tow on a &s;uperior being, who&s;e whole endeavours were employed, and who&s;e plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted, in terrifying, en&s;naring, tormenting, and de&s;troying mankind? who&s;e &s;uperior faculties were exerted in fomenting animo&s;ities among&s;t them, in contriving engines of de&s;truction, and inciting them to u&s;e them in maiming and murdering each other? who&s;e power over them was employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the rapacious, deceiving the &s;imple, and oppre&s;&s;ing the in|nocent? who, without provocation or advantage, &s;hould continue from day to day, void of all pity and remor&s;e, thus to torment mankind for diver&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time endeavour with his utmo&s;t care to pre&s;erve their lives, and to propagate their &s;pecies, in order to increa&s;e the number of victims devoted to his malevo|lence, and be delighted in proportion to the mi&s;eries he occa&s;ioned? I &s;ay, what name dete&s;table enough could we find for &s;uch a being? yet, if we impartially con&s;ider the ca&s;e, and our intermediate &s;ituation, we mu&s;t acknowledge, that, with regard to inferior ani|mals, ju&s;t &s;uch a being is a &s;port&s;man.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> SIEGE <HI>of</HI> CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD III. after the battle of Cre&s;&s;y, laid &s;iege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in &s;o im|pregnable a manner, that all the efforts of France proved ineffectual to rai&s;e the &s;iege, or throw &s;uccours into the city. The citizens, under Count Vienne, their gallant governor, made an admirable defence. France had now put the &s;ickle into her &s;econd harve&s;t, &s;ince Edward with his victorious army, &s;at down before the town. The eyes of all Europe were intent on the i&s;&s;ue. At length, a famine did more for Edward than arms.&mdash;After &s;uffering unheard-of calamities, they re|&s;olved to attempt the enemy's camp. They boldly &s;al|lied forth: The Engli&s;h joined battle; and, after a long and de&s;perate engagement, Count Vienne was taken pri&s;oner, and the citizens who &s;urvived the &s;laughter retired within their gates. The command devolving upon Eu&s;tace St Pierre, a man of mean birth but of exalted virtue, he offered to capitulate with Edward, provided he permitted them to depart with life and liberty. Edward, to avoid the imputation of cruelty, con&s;ented to &s;pare the bulk of the plebeians, provided they delivered up to him &s;ix of their principal citizens with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that &s;pirit of rebellion with which they had inflamed the vulgar. When his me&s;&s;enger, Sir Walter Mauny, delivered the terms, con&s;ternation and pale di&s;may were impre&s;&s;ed on every countenance. To a long and dead &s;ilence deep &s;ighs and groans &s;uc|ceeded, till Eu&s;tace St Pierre, getting up to a little emi|nence, thus addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly:&mdash;"My friends, we are brought to great &s;traits this day. We mu&s;t either yield to the terms of our cruel and en&s;naring con|queror, or give up our tender infants, our wives, and
<PB N="78" REF="86">daughters, to the bloody and brutal lu&s;ts of the violating &s;oldiers. Is there any expedient left, whereby we may avoid the guilt and infamy of delivering up tho&s;e who have &s;uffered every mi&s;ery with you, on the one hand, or the de&s;olation and horror of a &s;acked city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expedient le&s;t; a gracious, an excellent, a godlike expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life? Let him offer him&s;elf an oblation for the &s;afety of his peo|ple! He &s;hall not fail of a ble&s;&s;ed approbation from that Power, who offered up his only &s;on for the &s;alva|tion of mankind." He &s;poke;&mdash;but an univer&s;al &s;i|lence en&s;ued. Each man looked around for the exam|ple of that virtue and magnanimity which all wi&s;hed to approve in them&s;elves, though they wanted the re&s;olu|tion. At length St Pierre re&s;umed, "I doubt not but there are many here as ready, nay more zealous, of this martyrdom than I can be; though the &s;tation to which I am rai&s;ed by the captivity of Lord Vienne, imparts a right to be the fir&s;t in giving my life for your &s;akes. I give it freely; I give it cheerfully. Who comes next?" "Your &s;on," exclaimed a youth not yet come to maturity.&mdash;"Ah, my child!" cried St Pierre; "I am then twice &s;acrificed.&mdash;But, no: I have rather be|gotten thee a &s;econd time. Thy years are few, but full, my &s;on. The victim of virtue has reached the utmo&s;t purpo&s;e and goal of mortality. Who next, my friends? This is the hour of heroes." "Your kin&s;|man," cried John de Aire. "Your kin&s;man," cried James Wi&s;&s;ant. "Your kin&s;man," cried Peter Wi&s;|&s;ant.&mdash;"Ah!" exclaimed Sir Walter Mauny, bur&s;ting into tears, "why was not I a citizen of Calais!" The &s;ixth victim was &s;till wanting, but was quickly &s;up|plied by lot from numbers who were now emulous of &s;o ennobling an example. The keys of the city were then delivered to Sir Walter. He took the &s;ix pri&s;oners into his cu&s;tody; then ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the re|maining citizens, with their families, through the camp
<PB N="79" REF="87">of the Engli&s;h. Before they departed, however, they de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to take their la&s;t adieu of their de|liverers. What a parting! what a &s;cene! They crowded, with their wives and children, about St Pierre and his fellow-pri&s;oners. They embraced; they clung around; they fell pro&s;trate before them. They groaned; they wept aloud; and the joint clamour of their mourning pa&s;&s;ed the gates of the city, and was heard throughout the Engli&s;h camp. The Engli&s;h, by this time, were appri&s;ed of what pa&s;&s;ed within Calais. They heard the voice of lamentation, and their &s;ouls were touched with compa&s;&s;ion. Each of the &s;oldiers prepared a por|tion of his own victuals to welcome and entertain the half-fami&s;hed inhabitants; and they loaded them with as much as their pre&s;ent weakne&s;s was able to bear, in order to &s;upply them with &s;u&s;tenance by the way. At length St Pierre and his fellow-victims appeared under the conduct of Sir Walter and a guard. All the tents of the Engli&s;h were in&s;tantly emptied. The &s;oldiers poured from all parts, and arranged them&s;elves on each &s;ide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire, this little band of patriots as they pa&s;&s;ed. They bowed down to them on all &s;ides. They murmured their applau&s;e of that virtue, which they could not but revere even in enemies; and they regarded tho&s;e ropes which they had voluntarily a&s;&s;umed about their necks, as en&s;igns of greater dignity than that of the Briti&s;h garter. As &s;oon as they had reached the pre&s;ence, "Mauny," &s;ays the monarch, "are the&s;e the principal inhabitants of Ca|lais?"&mdash;"They are," &s;ays Mauny; "they are not on|ly the principal men of Calais, they are principal men of France, my Lord, if virtue has any &s;hare in the act of ennobling." "Were they delivered peaceably?" &s;ays Edward; "was there no re&s;i&s;tance, no commotion among the people?" "Not in the lea&s;t, my Lord; the people would all have peri&s;hed, rather than have delivered the lea&s;t of the&s;e to your Maje&s;ty. They are &s;elf-delivered, &s;elf-devoted, and come to offer up their ine&s;timable heads as an ample equivalent for the ran|&s;om
<PB N="80" REF="88">of thou&s;ands." Edward was &s;ecretly piqued at this reply of Sir Walter; but he knew the privilege of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment. "Ex|perience," &s;ays he, "has ever &s;hown, that lenity only &s;erves to invite people to new crimes.

<P>At this in&s;tant a &s;ound of triumph was heard through|out the camp. The Queen had ju&s;t arrived with a powerful reinforcement of gallant troops. Sir Walter Mauny flew to receive her Maje&s;ty, and briefly inform|ed her of the particulars re&s;pecting the &s;ix victims.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had been welcomed by Edward and his court, &s;he de&s;ired a private audience.&mdash;"My Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "the que&s;tion I am to enter upon, is not touching the lives of a few mechanics&mdash;it re&s;pects the honour of the Engli&s;h nation; it re&s;pects the glory of my Edward, my hu&s;band, my king.&mdash;You think you have &s;entenced &s;ix of your pri&s;oners to death. No, my Lord, they have &s;entenced them&s;elves; and their exe|cution would be the execution of their own orders, not the orders of Edward. The &s;tage on which they would &s;uffer, would be to them a &s;tage of honour, but a &s;tage of &s;hame to Edward; a reproach to his conque&s;ts; an indelible di&s;grace to his name. Let us rather di&s;appoint the&s;e haughty burghers, who wi&s;h to inve&s;t them&s;elves with glory at our expence. We cannot wholly deprive them of the merit of a &s;acrifice &s;o nobly intended, but we may cut them &s;hort of their de&s;ires; in the place of that death by which their glory would be con&s;um|mate, let us bury them under gifts; let us put them to confu&s;ion with applau&s;es. We &s;hall thereby defeat them of that popular opinion, which never fails to at|tend tho&s;e who &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of virtue." "I am convinced; you have prevailed. Be it &s;o," replied Ed|ward: "Prevent the execution; have them in&s;tantly before us." They came; when the Queen, with an a&s;|pect and accents diffu&s;ing &s;weetne&s;s, thus be&s;poke
<PB N="81" REF="89">them:&mdash;"Natives of France and inhabitants of Calais, ye have put us to a va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure in the recovery of our ju&s;t and natural inheritance: But you have acted up to the be&s;t of an erroneous judg|ment; and we admire and honour in you that valour and virtue, by which we are &s;o long kept out of our rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

You are now free to depart to your kinsfolk, your countrymen, to all tho&s;e who&s;e lives and liberties you have &s;o nobly redeemed, provided you refu&s;e not the tokens of our e&s;teem.

<P>I beheld his body half wa&s;ted away with long expecta|tion and confinement; and felt what kind of &s;ickne&s;s of the heart it is which ari&s;es from hope deferred. Upon looking nearer, I &s;aw him pale and feveri&s;h. In

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER widely the thinking part of mankind may have differed as to the proper mode of con|ducting education, they have always been unanimous in their opinion of its importance. The outward ef|fects of it are ob&s;erved by the mo&s;t inattentive. They know that the clown and the dancing-ma&s;ter are the &s;ame from the hand of nature; and, although a little farther reflection is requi&s;ite to perceive the effects of culture on the internal &s;en&s;es, it cannot be di&s;puted that the mind, like the body, when arrived at firmne&s;s and maturity, retains the impre&s;&s;ions it received in a more pliant and tender age.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of mankind, born to labour for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, are fixed in habits of indu&s;try by the iron hand of nece&s;&s;ity. They have little time or oppor|tunity for the cultivation of the under&s;tanding; the errors and immoralities in their conduct, that flow from the want of tho&s;e &s;entiments which education is in|tended to produce, will, on that account, meet with indulgence from every benevolent mind. But tho&s;e who are placed in a con&s;picuous &s;tation, who&s;e vices become more complicated and de&s;tructive, by the abu&s;e of knowledge, and the mi&s;application of improved ta|lents, have no title to the &s;ame indulgence. Their guilt is heightened by the rank and fortune which protect them from puni&s;hment, and which, in &s;ome degree, pre&s;erve them from that infamy their conduct has merited.</P>
<P>I hold it, then, uncontrovertible, that the higher the rank, the more urgent is the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;toring the mind with the principles, and directing the pa&s;&s;ions to the practice, of public and private virtue.</P>
<P>It will be allowed by all, that the great purpo&s;e of
<PB N="85" REF="93">education is to form the man and the citizen, that he may be virtuous, happy in him&s;elf, and u&s;eful to &s;ocie|ty. To attain this end his education &s;hould begin, as it were, from his birth, and be continued till he arrive at firmne&s;s and maturity of mind, as well as of body. Sincerity, truth, ju&s;tice, and humanity, are to be culti|vated from the fir&s;t dawnings of memory and ob&s;erva|tion. As the powers of the&s;e increa&s;e, the genius and di&s;po&s;ition unfold them&s;elves; it then becomes nece&s;&s;ary to check, in the bud, every propen&s;ity to folly or to vice; to root out every mean, &s;elfi&s;h, and ungenerous &s;enti|ment; to warm and animate the heart in the pur&s;uit of virtue and honour. The experience of ages has hitherto di&s;covered no &s;urer method of giving right im|pre&s;&s;ions to young minds, than by frequently exhibiting to them tho&s;e bright examples which hi&s;tory affords, and, by that means, in&s;piring them with tho&s;e &s;enti|ments of public and private virtue which breathe in the writings of the &s;ages of antiquity.</P>
<P>In this view, I have con&s;idered the acqui&s;ition of the dead languages as a mo&s;t important branch in the edu|cation of a gentleman. The &s;lowne&s;s with which he acquires them, prevents his memory from being loaded with facts fa&s;ter than his growing rea&s;on can compare and di&s;tingui&s;h; he becomes acquainted by degrees with the virtuous characters of ancient times; he admires their ju&s;tice, temperance, fortitude, and public &s;pirit, and burns with a de&s;ire to imitate them. The im|pre&s;&s;ions the&s;e have made, and the re&s;traints to which he has been accu&s;tomed, &s;erve as a check to the many tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions which the ideas of religion alone would, at that age, be unable to controul. Every vic|tory he obtains over him&s;elf &s;erves as a new guard to virtue. When he errs, he becomes &s;en&s;ible of his weak|ne&s;s, which, at the &s;ame time that it teaches him mode|ration, and forgivene&s;s to others, &s;hows the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping a &s;tricter watch over his own actions. Du|ring the&s;e combats, his rea&s;oning faculties expand, his judgment &s;trengthens, and, while he becomes acquaint|ed with the corruptions of the world, he fixes him&s;elf in the practice of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94">A man thus educated, enters upon the theatre of the world with many and great advantages. Accu&s;tomed to reflection, acquainted with human nature, the &s;trength of virtue, and depravity of vice, he can trace actions to their &s;ource, and be enabled, in the affairs of life, to avail him&s;elf of the wi&s;dom and experience of pa&s;t ages.</P>
<P>Very different is the modern plan of education fol|lowed by many, e&s;pecially with the children of per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank. They are introduced into the world almo&s;t from their very infancy. In&s;tead of having their minds &s;tored with the bright examples of antiquity, or tho&s;e of modern times, the fir&s;t knowledge they acquire is of the vices with which they are &s;urrounded; and they learn what mankind are, without ever knowing what they ought to be. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no &s;entiment of virtue, of no &s;ocial affection, they indulge, to the ut|mo&s;t of their ability, the gratification of every &s;elfi&s;h appetite, without any other re&s;traint than what &s;elf-in|tere&s;t dictates. In men thus educated, youth is not the &s;ea&s;on of virtue; they have contracted the cold in|difference and all the vices of age, long before they ar|rive at manhood. Finding no entertainment in their own brea&s;ts, as void of friends as incapable of friend|&s;hip, they &s;ink reflection in a life of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>As many of the bad effects of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of education may be attributed to a premature introduc|tion into the world, I &s;hall conclude by reminding tho&s;e parents and guardians who are &s;o anxious to bring their children and pupils early into public life, that one of the fine&s;t gentlemen, the brighte&s;t geniu&s;es, the mo&s;t u&s;eful and be&s;t informed citizens of which antiquity has left us an example, did not think him&s;elf qualified to appear in public till the age of twenty-&s;ix, and even continued his &s;tudies, for &s;ome years after, under the eminent teachers of Greece and Rome.</P>

<HEAD>ALBERT BANE.</HEAD>
<P>IN treating of the moral duties which apply to differ|ent relations of life, men of humanity and feeling have not omitted tho&s;e which are due from ma&s;ters to &s;ervants. Nothing, indeed, can be more natural than the attachment and regard to which the faithful &s;er|vices of our dome&s;tics are entitled; the connection grows up, like all the other family-charities, in early life, and is only extingui&s;hed by tho&s;e corruptions which blunt the others, by pride, by folly, by di&s;&s;ipa|tion, or by vice.</P>
<P>I hold indeed as the &s;ure &s;ign of a mind not poi&s;ed as it ought to be, if it be in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ures of home, to the little joys and endearments of a family, to the affections of relations, to the fidelity of dome&s;tics. Next to being well with his own con&s;cience, the friend|&s;hip and attachment of a man's family and dependents &s;eems to me one of the mo&s;t comfortable circum&s;tances in his lot.</P>
<P>It appears to me very pernicious mi&s;take, which I have &s;ometimes &s;een parents guilty of in the education of their children, to encourage and incite in them a haughty and de&s;potic behaviour to their &s;ervants; to teach them an early conceit of the difference of their conditions; to accu&s;tom them to con&s;ider the &s;ervices of their attendants as perfectly compen&s;ated by the wages they receive, and as unworthy of any return of kindne&s;s, attention, or complacency.</P>
<P>I was la&s;t autumn at my friend Colonel Cau&s;tic's in Scotland, and &s;aw there, on a vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Cau&s;tic, a young gentleman and his &s;i&s;ter, children of a neighbour of the Colonel's, with who&s;e appearance and manner I was particularly plea&s;ed.&mdash;"The hi&s;tory of their pa|rents," &s;aid my friend, "is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, and I
<PB N="88" REF="96">love to tell it, as I do every thing that is to the honour of our nature. Man is &s;o poor a thing taken in the gro&s;s, that when I meet with an in&s;tance of noblene&s;s in detail, I am glad to re&s;t upon it long, and to recall it often.</P>
<P>"The father of tho&s;e young folks, who&s;e looks you were &s;truck with, was a gentleman of con&s;iderable do|mains and exten&s;ive influence on the northern frontier of our country. In his youth he lived, as it was then more the fa&s;hion than it is now, at the &s;eat of his an|ce&s;tors, &s;urrounded with Gothic grandeur, and com|pa&s;&s;ed with feudal followers and dependents, all of whom could trace their connection, at a period more or le&s;s remote&punc; with the family of their chief. Every dome&s;tic in his hou&s;e bore the family name, and looked on him&s;elf as in a certain degree partaking its dignity, and &s;haring its fortune. Of the&s;e, one was in a parti|cular manner the favourite of his ma&s;ter. Albert Bane had been his companion from his infancy. Of an age &s;o much more advanced as to enable him to be a &s;ort of tutor to his youthful Lord, Albert had early taught him the rural exerci&s;es and rural amu&s;ements, in which he was eminently &s;kilful; he had attended him in the cour&s;e of his education at home, of his travels abroad, and was &s;till the con&s;tant companion of his excur&s;ions, and the a&s;&s;ociate of his &s;ports.</P>
<P>"On one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, a favourite dog of Al|bert's, which he had trained him&s;elf, and of who&s;e qualities he was proud, happened to mar the &s;port which his ma&s;ter expected, who, irritated at the di&s;ap|pointment, and having his gun ready cocked in his hand, &s;ired at the animal, which however, in the vio|lence of his re&s;entment, he mi&s;&s;ed. Albert, to whom the dog (O&s;car) was as a child, remon&s;trated again&s;t the ra&s;hne&s;s of the deed, in a manner rather too warm for his ma&s;ter, ruffled as he was with the accident, and con&s;cious of being in the wrong, to bear. In his pa&s;|&s;ion he &s;truck his faithful attendant; who &s;uffered the indignity in &s;ilence, and retiring, rather in grief than
<PB N="89" REF="97">in anger, left his native country that very night; and when he reached the neare&s;t town, enli&s;ted with a re|cruiting party of a regiment then on foreign &s;ervice. It was in the beginning of the war with France which broke out in 1744, rendered remarkable for the rebel|lion which the policy of the French court excited, in which &s;ome of the fir&s;t families in the Highlands were unfortunately engaged. Among tho&s;e who joined the &s;tandard of Charles, was the ma&s;ter of Albert.</P>
<P>After the battle of Culloden, &s;o fatal to that party, this gentleman, along with others who had e&s;caped the &s;laughter of the field, &s;heltered him&s;elf from the rage of the un&s;paring &s;oldiery, among the di&s;tant rece&s;&s;es of their country. To him his native mountains offered an a&s;ylum; and thither he naturally &s;led for protec|tion. Acquainted, in the pur&s;uits of the chace, with every &s;ecret path and unworn track, he lived for a con|&s;iderable time, like the deer of his fore&s;t, clo&s;e hid all day, and only venturing down at the fall of evening, to obtain from &s;ome of his cottagers, who&s;e fidelity he could tru&s;t, a &s;canty and precarious &s;upport. I have often heard him, for he is one of my olde&s;t acquain|tances, de&s;cribe the &s;cene of his hiding-place, at a later period, when he could recollect it in its &s;ublimity, without its horror."&mdash;"At times," &s;aid he, "when I ventured to the edge of the wood, among &s;ome of tho&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible craggs which you remember a few miles from my hou&s;e, I have heard, in the pau&s;es of the breeze which rolled &s;olemnly through the pines beneath me, the di&s;tant voices of the &s;oldiers, &s;houting in an&s;wer to one another, amid&s;t their inhuman &s;earch. I have heard their &s;hots re-echoed from cliff to cliff, and &s;een re|flected from the deep &s;till lake, the gleam of tho&s;e fires which con&s;umed the cottages of my people. Some|times &s;hame and indignation had nearly overcome my fear, and I have prepared to ru&s;h down the &s;teep, un|armed as I was, and to die at once by the &s;words of my enemies; but the in&s;tinctive love of life prevailed,
<PB N="90" REF="98">and &s;tarting as the roe bounded by me, I have again &s;hrunk back to the &s;helter I had left."</P>
<P>"One day," continued he, "the noi&s;e was nearer than u&s;ual; and at la&s;t, from the cave in which I lay, I heard the parties immediately below &s;o clo&s;e upon me, that I could di&s;tingui&s;h the words they &s;poke. After &s;ome time of horrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the voices grew weaker and more di&s;tant; and at la&s;t I heard them die away at the end of the wood. I ro&s;e and &s;tole to the mouth of the cave; when &s;uddenly a dog met me, and gave that &s;hort, quick bark by which they indicate their prey. Amid&s;t the terror of the circum&s;tance, I was yet ma&s;ter enough of my&s;elf to di&s;cover that the dog was O&s;car; and I own to you I felt his appearance like the retribution of ju&s;tice and of Heaven.&mdash;Stand! cried a threatening voice, and a &s;oldier pre&s;&s;ed through the thicket, with his bayonet charged.&mdash;It was Albert!

Shame, confu&s;ion, and remor&s;e, &s;topped my utterance, and I &s;tood motionle&s;s before him.&mdash;"My ma&s;ter!" &s;aid he, with the &s;tifled voice of wonder and of fear, and threw him&s;elf at my feet. I had recovered my
<PB N="91" REF="99">recollection. "You are revenged," &s;aid I, "and I am your pri&s;oner."&mdash;"Revenged! Alas! you have judged too hardly of me; I have not had one happy day &s;ince that fatal one on which I left my ma&s;ter; but I have lived, I hope, to &s;ave him. The party to which I belong are pa&s;&s;ed; for I lingered behind them among the&s;e woods and rocks which I remembered &s;o well in happier days.&mdash;There is, however, no time to be lo&s;t. In a few hours this wood will blaze, though they do not &s;u&s;pect that it &s;helters you. Take my dre&s;s, which may help your e&s;cape, and I will endeavour to di&s;po&s;e of yours. On the coa&s;t, to the we&s;tward, we have learned there is a &s;mall party of your frends, whom by following the river's track till du&s;k, and then &s;triking over the &s;houlder of the hill, you may join without much danger of di&s;covery."&mdash;"I felt the di&s;grace of owing &s;o much to him I had injured, and remon&s;trated again&s;t expo&s;ing him to &s;uch imminent danger of its being known that he had favoured my e&s;cape, which, from the temper of his commander, I knew would be in&s;tant death. Albert, in an agony of fear and di&s;tre&s;s, be&s;ought me to think only of my own &s;afety.&mdash;"Save us both," &s;aid he, "for if you die, I cannot live. Per|haps we may meet again; but whatever becomes of Albert, may the ble&s;&s;ing of God be with his ma&s;ter!"</P>
<P>Albert's prayer was heard. His ma&s;ter, by the ex|erci&s;e of talents which, though he had always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, adver&s;ity only taught him to u&s;e, acquired abroad a &s;tation of equal honour and emolument; and when the pro&s;criptions of party had cea&s;ed, returned home to his own country, where he found Albert advanced to the rank of a Lieutenant in the army, to which his valour and merit had rai&s;ed him, married to a lady by whom he had acquired &s;ome little fortune, and was the father of an only daughter, for whom nature had done much, and to who&s;e native endowments it was the chief &s;tudy and delight of her parents to add every thing that art could be&s;tow. The gratitude of the chief was only equalled by the happine&s;s of his follower, who&s;e hone&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="100">pride was not long after gratified, by his daughter's be|coming the wife of that ma&s;ter whom his generous fidelity had &s;aved. That ma&s;ter, by the clemency of more indulgent and liberal times, was again re&s;tored to the domain of his ance&s;tors, and had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the grand&s;on of Albert enjoy the hereditary birthright of his race.</P>

He that can only be u&s;eful on great occa&s;ions, may die without exerting his abilities, and &s;tand a helple&s;s &s;pectator of a thou&s;and vexations which fret away happine&s;s, and which nothing is required to remove but a little dex|terity of conduct and readine&s;s of expedient.</P>
<P>No degree of knowledge attainable by man is able to &s;et him above the want of hourly a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or to ex|tingui&s;h the de&s;ire of fond endearments, and tender of|ficiou&s;ne&s;s; and therefore, no one &s;hould think it un|nece&s;&s;ary to learn tho&s;e arts by which friend&s;hip may be gained. Kindne&s;s is pre&s;erved by a con&s;tant recipro|cation of benefits or interchange of plea&s;ures: But &s;uch benefits only can be be&s;towed, as others are capable of receiving, and &s;uch plea&s;ures only imparted, as others are qualified to enjoy.</P>
<P>By this de&s;cent from the pinnacles of art no honour will be lo&s;t; for the conde&s;cen&s;ions of learning are al|ways overpaid by gratitude. An elevated genius em|ployed in little things, appears, to u&s;e the &s;imile of Lon|ginus, like the &s;un in his evening declination: He re|mits his &s;plendour, but retains his magnitude; and plea&s;es more, though he dazzles le&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>NANCY COLLINS.</HEAD>
<P>AS I walked one evening through St Andrew's Square, I ob&s;erved a girl, meanly dre&s;&s;ed, coming along the pavement at a &s;low pace. When I pa&s;&s;ed her, &s;he turned a little towards me, and made a &s;ort of halt; but &s;aid nothing. I went on a few &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> before I turned my eye to ob&s;erve her. She had, by this time, re&s;umed her former pace. I remarked a certain ele|gance in her form, which the poorne&s;s of her garb could not altogether overcome: Her per&s;on was thin and genteel, and there was &s;omething not ungraceful in the &s;toop of her head, and the &s;eeming feeblene&s;s with which &s;he walked. I could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire, which her appearance gave me, of knowing &s;omewhat of her &s;ituation and circum&s;tances: I therefore walked back, and repa&s;&s;ed her with &s;uch a look as might induce her to &s;peak what &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous to &s;ay at fir&s;t. This had the effect I wi&s;hed&mdash;"Pity a poor orphan!" &s;aid &s;he, in a voice tremulous and weak. I &s;topped, and put my hand in my pocket: I had now a better op|portunity of ob&s;erving her. Her face was thin and pale; part of it was &s;haded by her hair, of a light brown colour, which was parted, in a di&s;ordered man|ner, at her forehead, and hung loo&s;e upon her &s;houl|ders; round them was ca&s;t a piece of tattered cloak, which with one hand &s;he held acro&s;s her bo&s;om, while the other was half out&s;tretched to receive the bounty I intended for her. Her large blue eyes were ca&s;t on the ground: She was drawing back her hand as I put a trifle into it; on receiving which &s;he turned them up to me, muttered &s;omething which I could not hear, and then, letting go her cloak, and pre&s;&s;ing her hands together, bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>It was not the action of an ordinary beggar, and my
<PB N="95" REF="103">curio&s;ity was &s;trongly excited by it. I de&s;ired her to fol|low me to the hou&s;e of a friend hard by, who&s;e benefi|cence I have often had occa&s;ion to know. When &s;he arrived there, &s;he was &s;o fatigued and worn out, that it was not till after &s;ome means u&s;ed to re&s;tore her, that &s;he was able to give us an account of her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Her name, &s;he told us, was Collins; the place of her birth one of the northern counties of England. Her father, who had died &s;everal years ago, left her remaining parent with the charge of her, then a child, and one brother, a lad of &s;eventeen. By his indu&s;try, however, joined to that of her mother, they were tolera|bly &s;upported, their father having died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall farm, with the right of pa&s;turage on an adjoining common, from which they obtained a decent livelihood: that, la&s;t &s;ummer, her brother having become acquaint|ed with a recruiting &s;erjeant, who was quartered in a neighbouring village, was by him enticed to enli&s;t as a &s;oldier, and &s;oon after marched off, along with &s;ome other recruits, to join his regiment: That this, &s;he be|lieved, broke her mother's heart, for &s;he had never af|terwards had a day's health, and, at length, had died about three weeks ago: That, immediately after her death, the &s;teward employed by the '&s;quire of whom their farm was held, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ever thing for the arrears of their rent: That, as &s;he had heard her brother's regiment was in Scotland when he enli&s;ted, &s;he had wandered thither in que&s;t of him, as &s;he had no other relation in the world to own her! But &s;he found on arriving there, that the regiment had been embarked &s;everal months before, and was gone a great way off, &s;he could not tell whither.</P>
<P>"This news," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>laid hold of my heart; and I have had &s;omething wrong here,</Q> putting her hand to her bo&s;om, <Q>ever &s;ince. I got a bed and &s;ome victuals in the hou&s;e of a woman here in town, to whom I told my &s;tory, and who &s;eemed to pity me. I had then a little bundle of things, which I had been allowed to take with me after my mother's
<PB N="96" REF="104">death; but the night before la&s;t, &s;omebody &s;tole it from me while I &s;lept; and the woman &s;aid &s;he would keep me no longer, and turned me out into the &s;treet, where I have &s;ince remained, and am almo&s;t dying of want.</Q></P>
<P>She was now in better hands; but our a&s;&s;i&s;tance had come too late. A frame, naturally delicate, had yield|ed to the fatigues of her journey and the hard&s;hips of her &s;ituation. She delined by &s;low but uninterrupted degrees, and ye&s;terday breathed her la&s;t. A &s;hort while before &s;he expired, &s;he a&s;ked to &s;ee me; and taking from her bo&s;om a little &s;ilver locket, which &s;he told me had been her mother's, and which all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es could not make her part with, begged I would keep it for her dear brother, and give it him, if ever he &s;hould return home, as a token of her remembrance.</P>
<P>I felt this poor girl's fate &s;trongly; but I tell not her &s;tory merely to indulge my feelings; I would make the reflections it may excite in my readers, u&s;eful to others who may &s;uffer from &s;imilar cau&s;es. There are many, I fear, from whom their country has called brothers, &s;ons, or fathers, to bleed in her &s;ervice, forlorn, like poor Nancy Collins, with <Q>no relation in the world to own them.</Q> Their &s;ufferings are often unknown, when they are &s;uch as mo&s;t demand compa&s;&s;ion. The mind that cannot obtrude its di&s;tre&s;&s;es on the ear of pity, is formed to feel their poignancy the deepe&s;t.</P>
<P>In our idea of military operations, we are too apt to forget the misfortunes of the people. In defeat, we think of the fall, and in victory, of the glory of com|manders; we &s;eldom allow our&s;elves to con&s;ider how many, in a lower rank, both events make wretched! How many, amid&s;t the acclamations of national triumph, are left to the helple&s;s mi&s;ery of the widow and the orphan, and, while victory celebrates her fe&s;tival, feel, in their di&s;tant hovels, the extremities of want and wretchedne&s;s!</P>

<P>IT was &s;ome time in the &s;ummer of that year in which Dendermond was taken by the allies,&mdash;which was about &s;even years before my father came into the coun|try,&mdash;and about as many, after the time, that my uncle Toby and Trim had privately decamped from my father's hou&s;e in town, in order to lay &s;ome of the fine&s;t &s;ieges to &s;ome of the fine&s;t fortified cities in Europe&mdash;when my uncle Toby was one evening getting his &s;upper, with Trim &s;itting behind him at a &s;mall &s;ideboard;&mdash;The landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand to beg a gla&s;s or two of &s;ack: 'Tis for a poor gentle|man,&mdash;I think, of the army, &s;aid the landlord, who was taken ill at my hou&s;e four days ago, and has never held up his head &s;ince, or had a de&s;ire to ta&s;te any thing, till ju&s;t now, that he has a fancy for a gla&s;s of &s;ack and a thin toa&s;t,&mdash;<HI>I think,</HI> &s;ays he, taking his hand from his forehead, <HI>it would comfort me.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;If I could neither beg, borrow, nor buy &s;uch a thing,&mdash;added the landlord,&mdash;I would almo&s;t &s;teal it for the poor gentleman, he is &s;o ill.&mdash;I hope in God he will &s;till mend, continued he&mdash;we are all of us concerned for him.</P>
<P>Thou art a good-natured &s;oul, I will an&s;wer for thee, cried my uncle Toby; and thou &s;halt drink the poor gentleman's health in a gla&s;s of &s;ack thy&s;elf,&mdash;and take a couple of bottles with my &s;ervice, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.</P>
<P>Though I am per&s;uaded, &s;aid my uncle Toby, as the landlord &s;hut the door, he is a very compa&s;&s;ionate fellow&mdash;Trim,&mdash;yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his gue&s;t too; there mu&s;t be &s;omething more than
<PB N="98" REF="106">common in him, that in &s;o &s;hort a time &s;hould win &s;o much upon the affections of his ho&s;t;&mdash;And of his whole family, added the corporal, for they are all con|cerned for him.&mdash;Step after him, &s;aid my uncle Toby,&mdash;do Trim,&mdash;and a&s;k if he knows his name.</P>
<P>&mdash;I have quite forgot it, truly, &s;aid the landlord, coming back into the parlour, with the corporal,&mdash;but I can a&s;k his &s;on again:&mdash;Has he a &s;on with him then? &s;aid my uncle Toby.&mdash;A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age;&mdash;but the poor creature has ta&s;ted almo&s;t as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day:&mdash;He has not &s;tirred from the bed-&s;ide the&s;e two days.</P>
<P>My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thru&s;t his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and Trim, without being ordered, took away without &s;aying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</P>
<P>&mdash;Stay in the room a little, &s;aid my uncle Toby.&mdash;Trim! &s;aid my uncle Toby, after he had light|ed his pipe and &s;moaked about a dozen whiffs.&mdash;Trim came in front of his ma&s;ter and made his bow;&mdash;my uncle Toby &s;moaked on, and &s;aid no more.&mdash;Corporal! &s;aid my uncle Toby&mdash;the corpo|ral made his bow.&mdash;My uncle Toby proceeded no farther, but fini&s;hed his pipe.</P>
<P>Trim! &s;aid my uncle Toby, I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping my&s;elf up warm in my requelaure, and paying a vi&s;it to this poor gen|tleman.&mdash;Your honour's roquelaure, replied the corporal, has not once been had on, &s;ince the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght before your honour receive your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St Nicholas;&mdash;and be&s;ides it is &s;o cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear &s;o, replied my uncle Toby: But I am
<PB N="99" REF="107">not at re&s;t in my mind, Trim, &s;ince the account the landlord has given me.&mdash;I wi&s;h I had not known &s;o much of this affair,&mdash;added my uncle Toby,&mdash;or that I had known more of it:&mdash;How &s;hall we manage it? Leave it, an't plea&s;e your honour, to me, quoth the corporal;&mdash;I'll take my hat and &s;tick, and go to the hou&s;e and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour.&mdash;Thou &s;halt go, Trim, &s;aid my uncle Toby, and here's a &s;hilling for thee to drink with his &s;ervant.&mdash;I &s;hall get it all out of him, &s;aid the corporal, &s;hutting the door.</P>
<P>My uncle Toby filled his &s;econd pipe; and had it not been, that he now and then wandered from the point, with con&s;idering whether it was not full as well to have the curtain of the tennail a &s;traight line, as a crooked one,&mdash;he might be &s;aid to have thought of nothing el&s;e but poor Le Fevre and his boy the whole time he &s;moaked it.</P>
<P>It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the a&s;hes out of his third pipe, that corporal Trim returned from the inn, and gave him the following account.</P>
<P>I de&s;paired at fir&s;t, &s;aid the corporal, of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelligence con|cerning the poor &s;ick lieutenant&mdash;Is he in the army then? &s;aid my uncle Toby&mdash;He is: &s;aid the corporal&mdash;And in what regiment? &s;aid my uncle Toby&mdash;I'll tell your honour, replied the corporal, every thing &s;traight forwards as I learnt it.&mdash;Then, Trim, I'll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l another pipe, &s;aid my uncle Toby, and not in|terrupt thee till thou ha&s;t done; &s;o &s;it down at thy ea&s;e, Trim, in the window &s;eat, and begin thy &s;tory again. The corporal made his old bow, which generally &s;poke, as plain as a bow could &s;peak it,&mdash;Your honour is good:&mdash;And having done that, he &s;at down, as he was ordered,&mdash;and begun the &s;tory to my uncle Toby over again in pretty near the &s;ame words.</P>
<P>I de&s;paired at fir&s;t, &s;aid the corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour about
<PB N="100" REF="108">the lieutenant and his &s;on; for when I a&s;ked where his &s;ervant was, from whom I made my&s;elf &s;ure of knowing every thing which was proper to be a&s;ked,&mdash;That's a right di&s;tinction, Trim, &s;aid my uncle Toby&mdash;I was an&s;wered, an' plea&s;e your honour, that he had no &s;ervant with him;&mdash;that he had come to the inn with hired hor&s;es, which, upon finding him|&s;elf unable to proceed, (to join, I &s;uppo&s;e, the regi|ment) he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the morning after he came.&mdash;If I get better, my dear, &s;aid he, as he gave his pur&s;e to his &s;on to pay the man,&mdash;we can hire hor&s;es from hence.&mdash;But alas! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, &s;aid the landlady to me,&mdash;for I heard the death-watch all night long;&mdash;and when he dies, the youth, his &s;on, will certainly die with him; for he is broken-hearted already.</P>
<P>I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toa&s;t the landlord &s;poke of;&mdash;but I will do it for my father my&s;elf, &s;aid the youth.&mdash;Pray let me &s;ave you the trouble, young gentleman, &s;aid I, taking up a fork for the purpo&s;e, and offering him my chair to &s;it down upon by the fire, whil&s;t I did it.&mdash;I believe, Sir, &s;aid he, very mode&s;tly, I can plea&s;e him be&s;t my|&s;elf.&mdash;I am &s;ure, &s;aid I, his honour will not like the toa&s;t the wor&s;e for being toa&s;ted by an old &s;oldier.&mdash;The youth took hold of my hand, and in&s;tantly bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;Poor youth! &s;aid my uncle Toby,&mdash;he has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a &s;oldier, Trim, &s;ounded in his ears like the name of a friend;&mdash;I wi&s;h I had him here.</P>

Nothing in the world, Trim, &s;aid my uncle Toby, blowing his no&s;e,&mdash;but that thou art a good-natured fellow.</P>
<P>When I gave him the toa&s;t, continued the corporal, I thought it was proper to tell him I was captain

<P>When the lieutenant had taken his gla&s;s of &s;ack and toa&s;t, he felt him&s;elf a little revived, and &s;ent down into the kitchen, to let me know, that in about ten minutes he &s;hould be glad if I would &s;tep up &s;tairs.&mdash;I believe, &s;aid the landlord, he is going to &s;ay his prayers,&mdash;for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bed &s;ide, and as I &s;hut the door, I &s;aw his &s;on take up a cu&s;hion.&mdash;</P>
<P>I thought, &s;aid the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr Trim, never &s;aid your prayers at all.&mdash;I heard the poor gentleman &s;ay his prayers la&s;t night, &s;aid the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it.&mdash;Are you &s;ure of it? replied the curate.&mdash;A &s;oldier, an' plea&s;e your reverence, &s;aid I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a par&s;on;&mdash;and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for honour too, he has the mo&s;t rea&s;on to pray to God of any one in the whole world.&mdash;'Twas well &s;aid of thee, Trim, &s;aid my uncle Toby.&mdash;But when a &s;oldier, &s;aid I, an' plea&s;e your reverence, has been &s;tanding for twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,&mdash;or engaged, &s;aid I, for months to|gether in long and dangerous marches;&mdash;harra&s;&s;ed perhaps in his rear to-day;&mdash;harra&s;&s;ing others to-mor|row;

<P>&mdash;My uncle Toby went to his bureau,&mdash;put his pur&s;e into his breeches pocket, and having ordered the corporal to go early in the morning for a phy&s;ician,&mdash;he went to bed and fell a&s;leep.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> MOUNTAIN <HI>of</HI> CALAMITY.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a month ago, in returning from a fox|chace on Nimrod, a rolling &s;tone threw him down, and falling with my right leg under him, &s;o brui&s;ed my knee, that I have never &s;ince been able to &s;et my foot to the ground; when the accident fir&s;t happened I was dejected beyond mea&s;ure, not &s;o much from the actual pain I &s;uffered, as from the horrors of being confined many weeks during the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for hunting. I am now almo&s;t free from pain, but the limb is &s;o weak, that I am &s;till confined, and have had, for the la&s;t fortnight pa&s;t, full lei&s;ure to reflect on my various &s;en&s;ations during my impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>You can hardly conceive, Sir, the prodigious revo|lution which has taken place in my mind. Many things now delight which formerly afforded no &s;atisfaction, and I look with indifference on pur&s;uits, which before appeared to me the mo&s;t engaging.</P>
<P>I have lately had recour&s;e to reading, which had previou&s;ly afforded me little amu&s;ement, and was con|&s;equently little pur&s;ued. Ye&s;terday evening, after read|ing the Spectator, where he compares <Q>the evils of this life to rocks and precipices, which appear rugged and barren at a di&s;tance, but at our nearer approach, we find little fruitful &s;pots and refre&s;hing &s;prings, mixed with the har&s;hne&s;s and deformities of nature.</Q></P>
<P>With my mind engaged in this contemplation, I went to re&s;t, when the following dream produced &s;uch vivid imagery to my fancy, that I almo&s;t doubt whether I was a&s;leep, or only mu&s;ing and commenting on the metaphor. I conceived my&s;elf tran&s;ported to a delight|ful country, beautifully variegated with gentle hills and vales, with woods and plains and cultivated fields, which were for ever changing as I pa&s;&s;ed on; for Time, who
<PB N="108" REF="116">was my conductor, never would give me leave to &s;top a minute in a place, except when &s;leep made me in&s;en|&s;ible of his progre&s;&s;ive motion: For then he would gently carry me in his arms to &s;ome &s;pot which com|manded nearly the &s;ame pro&s;pect with that where wearine&s;s had overtaken me; but I would not have you fancy my conductor was an old man with a &s;cythe and an hour gla&s;s, as he is generally repre&s;ented; no, he was continually changing &s;hapes; when I fir&s;t met him he was a healthy playful boy; he taught me many a puerile game, and cheered my fir&s;t &s;teps with pa&s;times and delights; we danced rather than walked the begin|ning of our journey, for all was &s;port and fe&s;tive inno|cence; at length he led me by the hand through Aca|demic Groves, where every &s;tep we took enlarged my pro&s;pects, and increa&s;ed my &s;atisfaction in his company. I had only one cau&s;e of di&s;content, and that was, as I before hinted, that he never would permit me to &s;top a minute in a place, or go back to view the &s;cenes which had given me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; indeed he would &s;ometimes give rea&s;on for his non-compliance, by telling me, <Q>that the delight of every &s;cene con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in its novelty;</Q> and he would &s;ometimes &s;hew me the picture of the places I had vi&s;ited, reflect|ed in the Mirror of Experience, which confirmed the truth of what he &s;aid. On my departure from the A|cademic Grove, I was &s;truck with the appearance of a va&s;t exten&s;ive plain, a fort of heath or common, inter|&s;ected by many roads, but which all &s;eemed to tend towards an object I had never before beheld; it was a di&s;tant mountain, who&s;e bleak and barren a&s;pect at once convinced me that it was the Mountain of Cala|mity; I &s;hrunk from the &s;ight, and would have gladly turned back into the Grove, or at lea&s;t wi&s;hed to &s;top, and re&s;olve which of the roads it were mo&s;t advi&s;eable to take; but my conductor hurried me on, bidding me not direct my eyes to painful objects at a di&s;tance, but look about me; I did &s;o, and was again delighted with the pro&s;pect near at hand; the ground was enamelled
<PB N="109" REF="117">with a thou&s;and flowers, that &s;hed their &s;weets as we pa&s;&s;ed by; I &s;aw before me at a little di&s;tance the mo&s;t delightful objects, through which the &s;everal roads &s;eemed to take their re&s;pective cour&s;es; one led thro' a city, who&s;e palaces glittered with riches, the effect of trade; another led to a &s;plendid Fane, dedicated to Naval and Military Honours; another to a Sacred Grove, where Holy Contemplation &s;eemed to en&s;ure peace and happine&s;s; and others &s;till thro' various in|tere&s;ting &s;cenes; each was &s;urrounded with enchant|ing pro&s;pects, but each was more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to a view of the di&s;tant Mountain; and I ob&s;erved, that in proportion as the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;everal places &s;truggled to a&s;cend to the highe&s;t &s;pots of their &s;itua|tion, they had a more di&s;tinct view of the Mountain which all wi&s;hed to &s;hun: Struck with this reflection, I cho&s;e a road different from any I have mentioned, and pa&s;&s;ed through villages and plea&s;ant farms, where un|expected &s;cenery on every &s;ide delighted me; I could often view detached parts of all the other roads, and &s;ometimes travelled a few miles in each; but though my pro&s;pects on each &s;ide were ever varying, and always plea&s;ant, yet I could not avoid a &s;ight of the fearful Mountain, and this as I approached it nearer, &s;eemed to rob the &s;urrounding land&s;capes of their charms, and by degrees, I found my &s;pirits &s;inking, and became di&s;gu&s;ted with my journey. Sometimes my conductor would bid me take courage, and enjoy with him the nearer pro&s;pects, or look back on the country we had pa&s;&s;ed; there I &s;aw &s;ome hills which I had climbed with ea&s;e, and &s;ome which I had avoided with|out knowing how: I was often plea&s;ed to &s;ee torrents which I had pa&s;&s;ed without danger, and &s;ometimes vexed to perceive objects that I had mi&s;&s;ed, and to which now there was no going back; by thus looking round occa&s;ionally, I in&s;en&s;ibly pre&s;&s;ed forward till I was &s;o near the Mountain, that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to remove it from my eyes; but how was I overwhelm|ed with de&s;pair at the horrors of my way, when on a
<PB N="110" REF="118">&s;udden, a few &s;teps farther pre&s;ented the full pro&s;pect of the River of Death, which &s;wept away thou&s;ands in their pa&s;&s;age to the Mountain; nay, I &s;aw &s;ome volun|tarily plunge into the waves, rather than look forward; but my conductor recommended me to Fortitude, who leading me through the bye-path of Difficulty, I began to a&s;cend the Mountain; and now I perceived it le&s;s barren than I dreaded; the roads were rugged indeed, but the view from thence of the country I had pa&s;&s;ed, was often not unplea&s;ing; the river at the foot of the hill had lo&s;t its terrors, though from the plains of Hap|pine&s;s it was a dreadful object; I could trace its cour&s;e, and &s;aw, with a&s;toni&s;hment, that it wandered through the whole extent of the journey I had taken, and that many who pur&s;ued the &s;everal tracks, were often de&s;troyed by the rapid torrent, in the mo&s;t unexpected part of their progre&s;s to that Mountain, which they &s;aw but never reached. As I was earne&s;tly &s;urveying the many places where I had my&s;elf e&s;caped, I &s;truck my brui&s;|ed knee again&s;t a projecting rock, and awoke with the pain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> ARTS <HI>of</HI> DECEIVING CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ea&s;y for every man, whatever be his character with others, to find rea&s;ons for e&s;teeming him&s;elf; and therefore cen&s;ure, contempt, or conviction of crimes, &s;eldom deprive him of his own favour. Tho&s;e indeed, who can &s;ee only external facts, may look upon him with abhorrence; but when he calls him&s;elf to his own tribunal, he finds every fault, if not ab&s;olutely ef|faces, yet &s;o much palliated, by the goodne&s;s of his in|tention, and the cog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncy of the motive, that very little guilt or turpitude remains; and when he takes a &s;ur|vey of the whole complication of his character, he di&s;|covers
<PB N="111" REF="119">covers &s;o many latent excellencies, &s;o many virtues that want but an opportunity to exert them&s;elves in act, and &s;o many kind wi&s;hes for univer&s;al happine&s;s, that he looks on him&s;elf as &s;uffering unju&s;tly under the in|famy of &s;ingle failings, while the general temper of his mind is unknown or unregarded.</P>
<P>It is natural to mean well, when only ab&s;tracted ideas of virtue are propo&s;ed to the mind, and no particular pa&s;&s;ion turns us a&s;ide from rectitude; and &s;o willing is every man to flatter him&s;elf, that the difference between approving laws and obeying them, is frequently for|gotten; he that acknowledges the obligations of mo|rality, and plea&s;es his vanity with enforcing them to others, concludes him&s;elf zealous in the cau&s;e of virtue, though he has no longer any regard to her precepts, than they conform to his own de&s;ires; and counts him|&s;elf among her warme&s;t lovers, becau&s;e he prai&s;es her beauty, though every rival &s;teals away his heart.</P>
<P>There are, however, great numbers who have little recour&s;e to the refinements of &s;peculation, but who yet live at peace with them&s;elves, by means which require le&s;s under&s;tanding, or le&s;s attention. When their hearts are burthened with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a crime, in&s;tead of &s;eeking for &s;ome remedy within them&s;elves, they look round upon the re&s;t of mankind, to find others tainted with the &s;ame guilt: They plea&s;e them|&s;elves with ob&s;erving, that they have numbers on their &s;ide; and that though they are hunted out from the &s;o|ciety of good men, they are not likely to be condemned to &s;olitude.</P>
<P>No man yet was ever wicked without &s;ecret di&s;con|tent; and according to the different degrees of remain|ing virtue, or unextingui&s;hed rea&s;on, he either endea|vours to reform him&s;elf, or corrupt others; either to regain the &s;tation which he has quitted, or prevail on others to imitate his defection; for as guilt is propaga|ted, the power of reproach is dimini&s;hed; and among numbers equally dete&s;table, every individual may be &s;heltered from &s;hame, though not from con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="120">The man who is branded with cowardice, may, with &s;ome appearance of propriety, turn all his force of ar|gument again&s;t a &s;tupid contempt of life, and ra&s;h pre|cipitation into unnece&s;&s;ary danger. Every rece&s;&s;ion from temerity is an approach towards cowardice; and though it be confe&s;&s;ed that bravery, like other virtues, &s;tands between faults on either hand, yet the place of the middle point may always be di&s;puted; he may therefore often impo&s;e upon carele&s;s under&s;tandings, by turning the attention wholly from him&s;elf, and keeping it fixed invariably on the oppo&s;ite fault; and by &s;hewing how many evils are avoided by his behaviour, he may conceal for a time tho&s;e which are incurred.</P>
<P>It is generally not &s;o much the de&s;ire of men, &s;unk into depravity, to deceive the world, as them&s;elves; for when no particular circum&s;tances make them depend|ent on others, infamy di&s;turbs them little, but as it re|vives their remor&s;e, and is echoed to them from their own hearts.

<HEAD>SELF DELUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be rea&s;onable to e&s;timate the difficulty of any enterpri&s;e by frequent mi&s;carriages, it may ju&s;tly be concluded that it is not ea&s;y for a man to know him&s;elf; for where&s;oever we turn our view, we &s;hall find almo&s;t all with whom we conver&s;e &s;o nearly as to judge of their &s;entiments, indulging more favourable conceptions of their own virtue than they have been able to impre&s;s upon others, and congratulating them|&s;elves upon degrees of excellence, which their fonde&s;t admirers cannot allow them to have attained.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e repre&s;entations of imaginary virtue are gen|erally con&s;idered as arts of hypocri&s;y, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> laid for confidence and prai&s;e. But I believe the &s;u&s;picion often unju&s;t; tho&s;e who thus propagate their own re|putation, only extend the fraud by which they have been them&s;elves deceived; for this failing is incident to n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bers, who &s;eem to live without de&s;igns, competi|tions, or pur&s;uits; it appears on occa&s;ions which pro|mi&s;e no acce&s;&s;ion of honour or of profit, and to per&s;ons from whom very little is to be hoped or &s;cared. It is, indeed, not ea&s;y to tell how far we may be blinded by the love of our&s;elves, when we reflect how much a &s;econdary pa&s;&s;ion can cloud our judgment, and how few faults a man, in the fir&s;t raptures of love, can di&s;|cover in the per&s;on or conduct of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>One &s;ophi&s;m by which men per&s;uade them&s;elves that they have tho&s;e virtues which they really want, is formed by the &s;ub&s;titution of &s;ingle acts for habits. A mi&s;er who once relieved a friend from the danger of a pri&s;on, &s;uffers his imagination to dwell for ever upon his own heroic genero&s;ity; he yields his heart up to in|dignation at tho&s;e who are blind to merit, or in&s;en&s;ible to mi&s;ery, and who can plea&s;e them&s;elves with the en|joyment
<PB N="114" REF="122">of that wealth, which they never permit others to partake. From any cen&s;ures of the world, or re|proaches of his con&s;cience, he has an appeal to action and to knowledge; and though his whole life is a cour&s;e of rapacity and avarice, he concludes him&s;elf to be tender and liberal, becau&s;e he has once performed an act of liberality and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>As a gla&s;s which magnifies objects by the approach of one end to the eye, le&s;&s;ens them by the application of the other, &s;o vices are extenuated by the inver&s;ion of that fallacy, by which virtues are augmented. Tho&s;e faults which we cannot conceal from our own notice, are con&s;idered, however frequent, not as habitual cor|ruptions, or &s;ettled practices, but as ca&s;ual failures, and &s;ingle lap&s;es. A man who has, from year to year, &s;et his country to &s;ale, either for the gratification of his ambition or re&s;entment, confe&s;&s;es that the heat of party now and then betrays the &s;evere&s;t virtue to mea&s;ures that cannot be &s;eriou&s;ly defended. He that &s;pends his days and nights in riot and debauchery, owns that his pa&s;&s;ions oftentimes overpower his re&s;olution. But each comforts him&s;elf that his faults are not with|out precedent, for the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t men have given way to the violence of &s;udden temptations.</P>
<P>There are men who always confound the prai&s;e of goodne&s;s with the practice, and who believe them&s;elves mild and moderate, charitable and faithful, becau&s;e they have exerted their eloquence in commendation of mild|ne&s;s, fidelity, and other virtues. This is an error al|mo&s;t univer&s;al among tho&s;e that conver&s;e much with dependents, with &s;uch who&s;e fear or intere&s;t di&s;po&s;es them to a &s;eeming reverence for any declamation, however enthu&s;ia&s;tic, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any boa&s;t, how|ever arrogant. Having none to recall their attention to their lives, they rate them&s;elves by the goodne&s;s of their opinions, and forget how much more ea&s;ily men may &s;hew their virtue in their talk than in their ac|tions.</P>
<P>The tribe is likewi&s;e very numerous of tho&s;e who
<PB N="115" REF="123">regulate their lives, not by the &s;tandard of religion, but the mea&s;ure of other men's virtue; who lull their own remor&s;e with the remembrance of crimes more atro|cious than their own, and &s;eem to believe that they are not bad while another can be found wor&s;e.</P>
<P>For e&s;caping the&s;e and a thou&s;and other deceits, many expedients have been propo&s;ed. Some have recom|mended the frequent con&s;ultation of a wi&s;e friend, ad|mitted to intimacy, and encouraged to &s;incerity. But this appears a remedy by no means adapted to general u&s;e: for in order to &s;ecure the virtue of one, it pre|&s;uppo&s;es more virtue in two than will generally be found.

<P>Part of the&s;e benefits it is in every man's power to procure to him&s;elf, by a&s;&s;igning proper portions of his life to the examination of the re&s;t, and by putting him|&s;elf frequently in &s;uch a &s;ituation, by retirement and ab&s;traction, as may weaken the influence of external objects.

<P>THERE is &s;carcely among the evils of human life, any &s;o generally dreaded as poverty. Every other &s;pecies of mi&s;ery, tho&s;e, who are not much accu&s;tomed to di&s;turb the pre&s;ent moment with reflection, can ea&s;ily forget, becau&s;e it is not always forced upon their re|gard; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s a day or an hour in the confluxes of men, without &s;eeing how much indi|gence is expo&s;ed to contumely, neglect, and in&s;ult: And in its lowe&s;t &s;tate, to hunger and nakedne&s;s; to injuries again&s;t which every pa&s;&s;ion is in arms, and to wants which nature cannot &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>Again&s;t other evils the heart is often hardened by true or by fal&s;e notions of dignity and reputation: Thus we &s;ee dangers of every kind faced with willing|ne&s;s, becau&s;e bravery, in a good or bad cau&s;e, is never without its encomia&s;ts and admirers. But in the pro&s;|pect of poverty, there is nothing but gloom and melan|choly; the mind and body &s;uffer together; its mi&s;eries bring no alleviations; it is a &s;tate in which every virtue is ob&s;cured, and in which no conduct can avoid re|proach; a &s;tate in which cheerfulne&s;s is in&s;en&s;ibility, and dejection &s;ullenne&s;s; of which the hard&s;hips are without honour, and the labours without reward.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="125">Of the&s;e calamities there &s;eems not to be wanting a general conviction; we hear on every &s;ide the noi&s;e of trade, and &s;ee the &s;treets thronged with numberle&s;s multitudes, who&s;e faces are clouded with anxiety, and who&s;e &s;teps are hurried by precipitation, from no other motive than the hope of gain; and the whole world is put in motion by the de&s;ire of that wealth, which is chief|ly to be valued as it &s;ecures us from poverty; for it is more u&s;eful for defence than acqui&s;ition, and is not &s;o much able to procure good as to exclude evil.</P>
<P>Yet there are always &s;ome who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions or follies lead them to a conduct oppo&s;ite to the general maxims and practice of mankind; &s;ome who &s;eem to ru&s;h upon poverty, with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s with which others a|void it; who &s;ee their revenues hourly le&s;&s;ened, and the e&s;tates which they inherit from their ance&s;tors mouldering away, without re&s;olution to change their cour&s;e of life; who per&s;evere again&s;t all remon&s;trances, and go forward with full career, though they &s;ee before them the precipice of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ate of almo&s;t every pa&s;&s;ion, when it has pa&s;&s;ed the bounds which nature pre&s;cribes, to counter|act its own purpo&s;e. Too much rage hinders the war|rior from circum&s;pection, too much eagerne&s;s of profit hurts the credit of the trader, too much ardour takes away from the lover that ea&s;ine&s;s of addre&s;s with which ladies are delighted. Thus extravagance, though dic|tated by vanity, and incited by voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, &s;eldom procures ultimately either applau&s;e or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If prai&s;e be ju&s;tly e&s;timated by the character of tho&s;e from whom it is received, little &s;atisfaction will be given to the &s;pendthrift by the encomiums which he purcha&s;es. For who are they that animate him in his pur&s;uits, but young men, thoughtle&s;s and abandoned like him&s;elf, unacquainted with all on which the wi&s;|dom of nations has impre&s;&s;ed the &s;tamp of excellence, and devoid alike of knowledge and of virtue? By whom is his profu&s;ion prai&s;ed, but by wretches who con&s;ider him as &s;ub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;es; Sirens
<PB N="118" REF="126">that entice him to &s;hipwreck, and Cyclops that are gaping to devour him?</P>
<P>Every man, who&s;e knowledge or who&s;e virtue can give value to his opinion, looks with &s;corn or pity, neither of which can afford much gratification to pride, on him whom the panders of luxury have drawn into the circle of their influence, and whom he &s;ees parcelled out among the different mini&s;ters of folly, and about to be torn to pieces by taylors and jockies, vintners and attornies, who at once rob and ridicule him, and who are &s;ecretly triumphing over his weakne&s;s, when they pre&s;ent new incitements to his appetite, and heighten his de&s;ires by counterfeited applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Such is the prai&s;e that is purcha&s;ed by prodigality. Even when it is yet no di&s;covered to be fal&s;e, it is the prai&s;e only of tho&s;e whom it is reproachful to plea&s;e, and who&s;e &s;incerity is corrupted by their intere&s;t; men who live by the riots which they encourage, and who know that whenever their pupil grows wi&s;e, they &s;hall lo&s;e their power. Yet with &s;uch flatteries, if they could la&s;t, might the cravings of vanity, which is &s;el|dom very delicate, be &s;atisfied; but the time is always ha&s;tening forward when this triumph, poor as it is, &s;hall vani&s;h, and when tho&s;e who now &s;urround them with ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and compliments, fawn among his equipage, and animate his riots, &s;hall turn upon him with in&s;olence, and reproach him with the vices pro|moted by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And as little preten&s;ions has the man, who &s;quanders his e&s;tate by vain or vicous expences, to greater de|grees of plea&s;ure than are obtained by others. To make any happine&s;s &s;incere, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be|lieve it to be la&s;ting; &s;ince, whatever we &s;uppo&s;e our|&s;elves in danger of lo&s;ing, mu&s;t be enjoyed with &s;olici|tude and unea&s;ine&s;s, and the more value we &s;et upon it, the more mu&s;t the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be embittered. How can he then be envied for his felicity, who knows that its continuance cannot be expected, and who is con&s;cious that a very &s;hort time will give him up to the
<PB N="119" REF="127">gripe of poverty, which will be harder to be borne, as he has given way to more exce&s;&s;es, wantoned in greater abundance, and indulged his appetites with more pro|fu&s;ene&s;s?</P>
<P>It appears evident that frugality is nece&s;&s;ary even to complete the plea&s;ure of expence; for it may be gene|rally remarked of tho&s;e who &s;quander what they know their fortune not &s;ufficient to allow, that in their mo&s;t jovial expence, there always breaks out &s;ome proof of di&s;content and impatience; they either &s;catter with a kind of wild de&s;peration, and affected lavi&s;hne&s;s, as cri|minals brave the gallows when they cannot e&s;cape it, or pay their money with a peevi&s;h anxiety, and endea|vour at once to &s;pend idly, and to &s;ave meanly: Having neither firmne&s;s to deny their pa&s;&s;ions, nor courage to gratify them, they murmur at their own enjoyments, and poi&s;on the bowl of plea&s;ure by reflection on the co&s;t.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e men there is often the vociferation of merriment, but very &s;eldom the tranquillity of cheer|fulne&s;s; they inflame their imaginations to a kind of momentary jollity, by the help of wine and riot, and con&s;ider it as the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the night to &s;tupify recollection, and lay that rea&s;on a&s;leep which di&s;turbs their gaiety, and calls upon them to retreat from ruin.</P>
<P>But this poor broken &s;atisfaction is of &s;hort continu|ance, and mu&s;t be expiated by a long &s;eries of mi&s;ery and regret. In a &s;hort time the creditor grows impa|tient, the la&s;t acre is &s;old, the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites &s;till continue their tyranny, with ince&s;&s;ant calls for their u&s;ual gratifications, and the remainder of life pa&s;&s;es away in vain repentance, or impotent de&s;ire.</P>

<Q><L>Exiles, the proverb &s;ays, &s;ub&s;i&s;t on hope;</L>
<L>Delu&s;ive hope &s;till points to di&s;tant good,</L>
<L>To good that mocks approach.</L></Q>
<P>THERE is no temper &s;o generally indulged as hope; other pa&s;&s;ions operate by &s;tarts, on parti|cular occa&s;ions, or in certain parts of life; but hope begins with the fir&s;t power of comparing our actual with our po&s;&s;ible &s;tate, and attends us through every &s;tage and period, always urging us forward to new ac|qui&s;itions, and holding out &s;ome di&s;tant ble&s;&s;ing to our view, promi&s;ing us either relief from pain, or increa&s;e of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Hope is nece&s;&s;ary in every condition. The mi&s;eries of poverty, of &s;ickne&s;s, of captivity, would, without this comfort, be in&s;upportable; nor does it appear that the happie&s;t lot of terre&s;trial exi&s;tence can &s;et us above the want of this general ble&s;&s;ing; or that life, when the gifts of nature and of fortune are accumulated upon it, would not &s;till be wretched, were it not elevated and delighted by the expectation of &s;ome new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of &s;ome enjoyment yet behind, by which the wi&s;h &s;hall be at la&s;t &s;atisfied, and the heart filled up to its utmo&s;t extent.</P>
<P>Hope is, indeed, very fallacious, and promi&s;es what it &s;eldom gives; but its promi&s;es are more valuable than the gifts of fortune, and it &s;eldom fru&s;trates us without a&s;&s;uring us of recompen&s;ing the delay by a greater bounty.</P>
<P>I was mu&s;ing on this &s;trange inclination which every man feels to deceive him&s;elf, and con&s;idering the ad|vantages and dangers proceeding from this gay pro&s;|pect of futurity, when, falling a&s;leep, on a &s;udden I
<PB N="121" REF="129">found my&s;elf placed in a garden, of which my &s;ight could de&s;cry no limits. Every &s;cene about me was gay and glad&s;ome, light with &s;un&s;hine, and fragrant with perfumes; the ground was painted with all the variety of &s;pring, and all the choir of nature was &s;inging in the groves.</P>
<P>At length I &s;aw an innumerable multitude of every age and &s;ex, who &s;eemed all to partake of &s;ome general felicity; for every cheek was flu&s;hed with confidence, and every eye &s;parkled with eagerne&s;s: yet each ap|peared to have &s;ome particular and &s;ecret plea&s;ure, and very few were willing to communicate their intentions, or extend their concern beyond them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On enquiring, I was informed that I was then in the garden of HOPE, the daughter of DESIRE, and that all tho&s;e whom I &s;aw thus tumultuou&s;ly bu&s;tling round me, were inticed by the promi&s;es of HOPE, and ha&s;ting to &s;eize the gifts which &s;he held in her hand.</P>
<P>I turned my &s;ight upward, and &s;aw a godde&s;s in the bloom of youth, &s;itting on a throne; around her lay all the gifts of fortune, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of life were &s;pread abroad to view; &s;he had a perpetual gaiety of a&s;pect, and every one imagined that her &s;mile, which was impartial and general, was directed to him&s;elf, and triumphed in his own &s;uperiority to others, who had conceived the &s;ame confidence from the &s;ame mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I then mounted an eminence, from which I had a more exten&s;ive view of the whole place, and could with le&s;s perplexity con&s;ider the different conduct of the crowds that filled it. From this &s;tation I ob&s;erved, that the entrance into the garden of HOPE was by two gates, one of which was kept by REASON, and the other by FANCY. REASON was &s;urly and &s;crupulous, and &s;eldom turned the key without many interroga|tories, and long he&s;itation; but FANCY was a kind and gentle portre&s;s, &s;he held her gate wide open, and welcomed all equally to the di&s;trict under her &s;uperin|tendency; &s;o that the pa&s;&s;age was crowded by all tho&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="130">who either feared the examination of REASON, or had been rejected by her.</P>
<P>From the gate of REASON there was a way to the throne of HOPE, by a craggy, &s;lippery, and winding path, called the <HI>Streight of Difficulty,</HI> which tho&s;e who entered with the permi&s;&s;ion of the guard endeavoured to climb. But though they &s;urveyed the way cheerfully before they began to ri&s;e, and marked out the &s;everal &s;tages of their progre&s;s, they commonly found unex|pected ob&s;tacles, and were obliged frequently to &s;top on the &s;udden, where they imagined the way plain and even. A tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;and intricacies embarra&s;&s;ed them, a thou&s;and &s;lips threw them back, and a thou&s;and pitfals impeded their advance. So formidable were the dan|gers, and &s;o frequent the mi&s;carriages, that many re|turned from the fir&s;t attempt, and many fainted in the mid&s;t of the way, and only a very &s;mall number were led up to the &s;ummit of HOPE, by the hand of FOR|TITUDE. Of the&s;e few the greater part, when they had obtained the gift which HOPE had promi&s;ed them, regretted the labour which it co&s;t, and felt in their &s;uc|ce&s;s the regret of di&s;appointment; the re&s;t retired with their prize, and were led by WISDOM to the bowers of CONTENT.</P>
<P>Turning then towards the gate of FANCY, I could find no way to the &s;eat of HOPE; but though &s;he &s;at full in view, and held out her gifts with an air of in|vitation, which filled every heart with rapture, the mountain was, on that &s;ide, inacce&s;&s;ibly &s;teep, but &s;o channelled and &s;haded, that none perceived the im|po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;cending it, but each imagined him&s;elf to have di&s;covered a way to which the re&s;t were &s;tran|gers. Many expedients were indeed tried by this in|du&s;trious tribe, of whom &s;ome were making them&s;elves wings, which others were contriving to actuate by the perpetual motion. But with all their labour, and all their artifices, they never ro&s;e above the ground, or quickly fell back, nor ever approached the throne of HOPE, but continued &s;till to gaze at a di&s;tance, and
<PB N="123" REF="131">laughed at the &s;low progre&s;s of tho&s;e whom they &s;aw toiling in the <HI>Streight of Difficulty.</HI></P>
<P>Part of the favourites of FANCY, when they had entered the garden, without making, like the re&s;t, an at|tempt to climb the mountain, turned immediately to the vale of IDLENESS, a calm and undi&s;turbed retire|ment, from whence they could always have HOPE in pro&s;pect, and to which they plea&s;ed them&s;elves with believing that &s;he intended &s;peedily to de&s;cend. The&s;e were indeed &s;corned by all the re&s;t; but they &s;eemed very little affected by contempt, advice, or reproof, by were re&s;olved to expect at ea&s;e the favour of the godde&s;s.</P>
<P>Among this gay race I was wandering, and found them ready to an&s;wer all my que&s;tions, and willing to communicate their mirth: but turning round I &s;aw two dreadful mon&s;ters entering the vale, one of whom I knew to be AGE, and the other WANT. Sport and revelling were now at an end, and an univer&s;al &s;hriek of affright and di&s;tre&s;s bur&s;t out and awaked me.</P>

<HEAD>On the <HI>IMPORTANCE</HI> of a <HI>GOOD CHARACTER,</HI> con|&s;idered only with <HI>RESPECT</HI> to <HI>INTEREST.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the minds of men are infinitely various, and as they are therefore influenced in the choice of a conduct by different inducements, the morali&s;t mu&s;t omit no motive, however &s;ubordinate in its nature, while it appears likely to lead &s;ome among mankind to a laudable, or even a blamele&s;s behaviour. A regard to ea&s;e, to intere&s;t, and to &s;ucce&s;s, in the u&s;ual pur&s;uits of wealth and ambition, may induce many to pur&s;ue an hone&s;t and honourable conduct, who would not have been influenced by purer motives; but who, after they have once perceived the intrin&s;ic excellence and beauty
<PB N="124" REF="132">of &s;uch a conduct, will probably per&s;evere in it for its own &s;ake, and upon higher con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are to make their own way either to wealth or honours, a good character is u&s;ually no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than addre&s;s and abilities. Though human nature is degenerate, and corrupts it&s;elf &s;till more by its own inventions; yet it u&s;ually retains to the la&s;t an e&s;teem for excellence. But even if we are arrived at &s;uch an extreme degree of depravity as to have lo&s;t our native reverence for virtue; yet a regard to our own intere&s;t and &s;afety, which we &s;eldom lo&s;e, will lead us to apply for aid, in all important tran&s;actions, to men who&s;e integrity if unimpeached. When we chu&s;e an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, a partner, a &s;ervant, our fir&s;t enquiry is con|cerning his character. When we have occa&s;ion for a coun&s;ellor or attorney, a phy&s;ician or apothecary, what|ever we may be our&s;elves, we always chu&s;e to tru&s;t our property and per&s;ons to men of the be&s;t character. When we &s;ix on the trade&s;men who are to &s;upply us with nece&s;&s;aries, we are not determined by the &s;ign of the lamb, or the wolf, or the fox; nor by a &s;hop fitted up in the mo&s;t elegant ta&s;te, but by the faire&s;t reputa|tion. Look into a daily new&s;paper, and you will &s;ee, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t rank, how important the characters of the employed appear to the employers. After the adverti&s;ement has enumerated the qualities required in the per&s;on wanted, there con&s;tantly follows, that none need apply who cannot bring an undeniable character. Offer your&s;elf as a candidate for a &s;eat in parliament, be promoted to honour and emolument, or in any re&s;pect attract the attention of mankind upon your&s;elf, and, if you are vulnerable in your character, you will be deeply wounded. This is a general te&s;ti|mony in favour of hone&s;ty, which no writings and no practices can po&s;&s;ibly refute.</P>
<P>Young men, therefore, who&s;e characters are yet un|fixed, and who, con&s;equently, may render them ju&s;t &s;uch as they wi&s;h, ought to pay great attention to the fir&s;t &s;teps which they take on their entrance into life. They are
<PB N="125" REF="133">u&s;ually carele&s;s and inattentive to this object. They pur&s;ue their own plans with ardour, and neglect the opinions which others entertain of them. By &s;ome thoughtle&s;s action or expre&s;&s;ion, they &s;uffer a mark to be impre&s;&s;ed upon them, which &s;carcely any &s;ub&s;equent merit can entirely era&s;e. Every man will find &s;ome per&s;ons, who, though they are not profe&s;&s;ed enemies, yet view him with an envious or jealous eye; and who will gladly revive any tale to which truth has given the &s;lighte&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>Indeed, all men are &s;o much inclined to flatter their own pride by detracting from the reputation of others, that even if we are able to maintain an immaculate conduct, it would &s;till be difficult to pre&s;erve an imma|culate character. But yet it is wi&s;dom not to furni&s;h this detracting &s;pirit with real &s;ubjects for the exerci&s;e of its activity. While calumny is &s;upported only by ima|gination, or by malice, we may &s;ometimes remove, by contradicting it; but wherever folly or vice have &s;up|plied facts, we can &s;eldom do more than aggravate the evil, by giving it an apparent attention. The malignity of &s;ome among the various di&s;po&s;itions of which man|kind are compo&s;ed, is often highly gratified at the view of injured &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>In this turbulent and confu&s;ed &s;cene, where our words and actions are often mi&s;under&s;tood and oftener mi&s;repre&s;ented, it is indeed difficult even for innocence and integrity to avoid reproach, abu&s;e, contempt, and hatred. The&s;e not only hurt our intere&s;t and impede our advancement in life, but &s;orely afflict the feelings of a tender and delicate mind. It is then the part of wi&s;dom fir&s;t to do every thing in our power to pre&s;erve an irreproachable character, and then to let our happi|ne&s;s depend chiefly on the approbation of our own con|&s;ciences, and on the advancement of our intere&s;t in a world where liars &s;hall not be believed, and where &s;lan|derers &s;hall receive countenance from none but him who, in Greek, is called, by way of eminence, Diabo|lus, or the Calumniator.</P>

<P>YOUR parents have watched over your helple&s;s in|fancy, and conducted you, with many a pang, to an age at which your mind is capable of manly improve|ment. Their &s;olicitude &s;till continues, and no trouble nor expence is &s;pared in giving you all the in&s;tructions and accompli&s;hments which may enable you to act your part in life, as a man of poli&s;hed &s;en&s;e and confirmed virtue. You have, then, already contracted a great debt of gratitude to them. You can pay it by no other method but by u&s;ing the advantages which their good|ne&s;s has afforded you.</P>
<P>If your endeavours are deficient, it is in vain that you have tutors, books, and all the external apparatus of literary pur&s;uits. You mu&s;t love learning, if you in|tend to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. In order to love it, you mu&s;t feel its delights; in order to feel its delights, you mu&s;t apply to it, however irk&s;ome at fir&s;t, clo&s;ely, con&s;tantly, and for a con&s;iderable time. If you have re&s;olution enough to do this; you cannot but love learning; for the mind always loves that to which it has been long, &s;teadily, and voluntarily attached. Habits are formed, which render what was at fir&s;t di&s;agreeable, not only plea&s;ant, but nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ant, indeed, are all the paths which lead to polite and elegant literature. Yours, then, is &s;urely a lot particularly happy. Your education is of &s;uch a &s;ort, that its principal &s;cope is to prepare you to receive a re|fined plea&s;ure during your life. Elegance, or delicacy of ta&s;te, is one of the fir&s;t objects of a cla&s;&s;ical di&s;cipline; and it is this fine quality which opens a new world to the &s;cholar's view. Elegance of ta&s;te has a connection with many virtues, and all of them virtues of the mo&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="135">amiable kind. It tends to render you at once good and agreeable. You mu&s;t therefore be an enemy to your own enjoyments, if you enter on the di&s;cipline which leads to the attainment of a cla&s;&s;ical and liberal education with reluctance. Value duly the opportuni|ties you enjoy, and which are denied to thou&s;ands of your fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>Without exemplary diligence, you will make but a contemptible proficiency. You may indeed pa&s;s through the forms of &s;chools and univer&s;ities, but you will bring nothing away from them of real value The proper &s;ort and degree of diligence you cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s, but by the efforts of your own re&s;olution. Your in&s;tructor may, in|deed, confine you within the walls of a &s;chool, a certain number of hours; he may place books before you, and compel you to fix your eyes upon them; but no autho|rity can chain down your mind. Your thoughts will e&s;cape from every external re&s;traint, and, amid&s;t the mo&s;t &s;erious lectures, may be ranging in the wild pur|&s;uit of trifles or vice. Rules, re&s;traints, commands, and puni&s;hments may, indeed, a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;trengthening your re&s;olution; but, without your own voluntary choice, your diligence will not often conduce to your plea&s;ure or advantage. Though this truth is obvious, yet it &s;eems to be a &s;ecret to tho&s;e parents who expect to find their &s;on's improvement increa&s;e in proportion to the number of tutors and external a&s;&s;i&s;tances, which their opulence has enabled them to provide. The&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, indeed, are &s;ometimes afforded, chiefly that the young heir to a title or e&s;tate may indulge him&s;elf in idlene&s;s and nominal plea&s;ures. The le&s;&s;on is con&s;trued to him, and the exerci&s;e written for him by the private tutor, while the haple&s;s youth is engaged in &s;ome ruinous plea&s;ure, which at the &s;ame time prevents him from learning any thing de&s;irable, and leads to the formation of de&s;tructive habits, which can &s;eldom be removed.</P>
<P>But the principal ob&s;tacle to improvement at your &s;chool, e&s;pecially if you are too plentifully &s;upplied with money, is a perver&s;e ambition of being di&s;tingui&s;hed as
<PB N="128" REF="136">a boy of &s;pirit in mi&s;chievous pranks, in neglecting the ta&s;ks and le&s;&s;ons, and for every vice and irregularity which the puerile age can admit. You will have &s;en&s;e enough, I hope, to di&s;cover, beneath the ma&s;k of gaiety and good-nature, that malignant &s;pirit of detraction, which endeavours to render the boy who applies to books, and to all the duties and proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;chool, ridiculous. You will &s;ee, by the light of your rea&s;on, that the ridicule is mi&s;applied. You will di&s;cover, that the boys who have recour&s;e to ridicule, are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;tupid, unfeeling, ignorant, and vicious. Their noi&s;y folly, their bold confidence, their contempt of learning, and their defiance of authority, are, for the mo&s;t part, the genuine effects of hardened in&s;en&s;ibility. Let not their in&s;ults and ill-treatment di&s;pirit you. If you yield to them with a tame and abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they will not fail to triumph over you with additional in&s;olence. Di&s;play a fortitude in your pur&s;uits, equal in degree to the ob&s;tinacy in which they per&s;i&s;t in theirs. Your fortitude will &s;oon over|come theirs; which is &s;eldom any thing more than the audacity of a bully. Indeed you cannot go through a &s;chool with ea&s;e to your&s;elf, and with &s;ucce&s;s, without a con&s;iderable &s;hare of courage. I do not mean that &s;ort of courage which leads to battles and contentions, but which enables you to have a will of your own, and to pur&s;ue what is right, amid&s;t all the per&s;ecutions of &s;urrounding enviers, dunces, and detractors. Ridicule is the weapon made u&s;e of a &s;chools, as well as in the world, when the fortre&s;&s;es of virtue are to be a&s;&s;ailed. You will effectually repel the attack by a dauntle&s;s &s;pirit and unyielding per&s;everance. Though numbers are again&s;t you, yet, with truth and rectitude on your &s;ide, you may be IPSE AGMEN, though alone, yet equal to an army.</P>
<P>By laying in a &s;tore of u&s;eful knowledge, adorning your mind with elegant literature, improving and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing your conduct by virtuous principles, you cannot fail of being a comfort to tho&s;e friends who have &s;up|ported
<PB N="129" REF="137">you, of being happy within your&s;elf, and of being well received by mankind. Honour and &s;ucce&s;s in life will probably attend you. Under all circum|&s;tances you will have an internal &s;ource of con&s;olation, an entertainment, of which no &s;ublunary vici&s;&s;itude can deprive you. Time &s;hews how much wi&s;er is your choice than that of your idle companions, who would gladly have drawn you into their a&s;&s;ociation, or rather into their con&s;piracy, as it has been called, again&s;t good manners, and again&s;t all that is honourable and u&s;eful. While you appear in &s;ociety as a re&s;pectable and valuable member of it, they have &s;acrificed, at the &s;hrine of vanity, pride, extravagance, and fal&s;e plea&s;ure, their health and their &s;en&s;e, their fortunes and their characters.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>WANT</HI> of <HI>PIETY</HI> ari&s;es from the <HI>WANT</HI> of <HI>SENSIBILITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT appears to me, that the mind of man, when it is free from natural defects and acquired corruption, feels no le&s;s a tendency to the indulgence of devo|tion, than to virtuous love, or to any other of the more refined and elevated affections. But debauchery and exce&s;s contribute greatly to de&s;troy all the &s;u&s;ceptible delicacy with which nature u&s;ually furni&s;hes the heart; and, in the general extinction of our better qualities, it is no wonder that &s;o pure a &s;entiment as that of piety, &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t to expire.</P>
<P>It is certain that the under&s;tanding may be improved in a knowledge of the world, and in the arts of &s;ucceed|ing in it, while the heart, or whatever con&s;titutes the &s;eat of the moral and &s;entimental feelings, is gradually receding from its proper and original perfection. In|deed, experience &s;eems to evince, that it is hardly po&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="130" REF="138">to arrive at the character of a complete man of the world, without lo&s;ing many of the mo&s;t valuable &s;enti|ments of uncorrupted nature. A complete man of the world is an artificial being; he has di&s;carded many of the native and laudable tendencies of his mind, and a|dopted a new &s;y&s;tem of objects and propen&s;ities of his own creation. The&s;e are commonly gro&s;s, coar&s;e, &s;or|did, &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;en&s;ual. All, or either of the&s;e attri|butes, tend directly to blunt the &s;en&s;e of every thing liberal, enlarged, di&s;intere&s;ted; of every thing which participates more of an intellectual than of a &s;en&s;ual nature. When the heart is tied down to the earth by lu&s;t and avarice, it is not extraordinary that the eye &s;hould be &s;eldom lifted up to heaven. To the man who &s;pends his Sunday (becau&s;e he thinks the day fit for lit|tle el&s;e) in the counting-hou&s;e, in travelling, in the ta|vern, or in the brothel, tho&s;e who go to church appear as fools, and the bu&s;ine&s;s they go upon as non&s;en&s;e. He is callous to the feelings of devotion; but he is tremblingly alive to all that gratifies his &s;en&s;es or pro|motes his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been remarked of tho&s;e writers who have at|tacked chri&s;tianity, and repre&s;ented all religions merely as diver&s;ified modes of &s;uper&s;tition, that they were in|deed, for the mo&s;t part, men of a metaphy&s;ical and a di&s;putatious turn of mind, but u&s;ually little di&s;tingui&s;hed for benignity and genero&s;ity. There was, amid&s;t all their preten&s;ions to logical &s;agacity, a cloudine&s;s of ideas, and a coldne&s;s of heart, which rendered them very unfit judges on a que&s;tion in which the heart is chiefly intere&s;ted; in which the language of nature is more expre&s;&s;ive and convincing, than all the dreary &s;ub|tleties of the di&s;mal metaphy&s;icians. Even the rea&s;oning faculty, on which we &s;o greatly value our&s;elves, may be perverted by exce&s;&s;ive refinement; and there is an ab|&s;tru&s;e, but vain and fooli&s;h philo&s;ophy, which philo&s;o|phizes us out of the noble&s;t parts of our noble nature. One of tho&s;e parts of us is our in&s;tinctive &s;en&s;e of re|ligion, of which not one of tho&s;e brutes which the phi|lo&s;ophers
<PB N="131" REF="139">mo&s;t admire, and to who&s;e rank they wi&s;h to reduce us, is found in the &s;lighte&s;t degree to participate.</P>
<P>Such philo&s;ophers may be called, in a double &s;en&s;e, the enemies of mankind. They not only endeavour to entice man from his duty, but to rob him of a mo&s;t exalted and natural plea&s;ure. Such, &s;urely, is the plea&s;ure of devotion. For when the &s;oul ri&s;es above this little orb, and pours its adoration at the throne of cele&s;tial Maje&s;ty, the holy fervour which it fells is it&s;elf a rapturous delight. Neither is this a declamatory re|pre&s;entation, but a truth felt and acknowledged by all the &s;ons of men; except tho&s;e who have been defective in &s;en&s;ibility, or who hoped to gratify the pride or the malignity of their hearts, by &s;ingular and pernicious &s;peculation.</P>
<P>It is however certain, that a devotional ta&s;te and habit are very de&s;irable in them&s;elves, exclu&s;ive of their effects in meliorating the morals and di&s;po&s;ition, and promoting pre&s;ent and future felicity. They add dignity, plea&s;ure, and &s;ecurity to any age: but to old age they are the mo&s;t becoming grace, the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial &s;upport, and the &s;weete&s;t comfort. In order to pre&s;erve them, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve our &s;en&s;ibility; and no|thing will contribute &s;o much to this purpo&s;e as a life of temperance, innocence, and &s;implicity.</P>

<HEAD>On the <HI>GUILT</HI> of <HI>INCURRING DEBTS,</HI> without either a <HI>PROSPECT</HI> or an <HI>INTENTION</HI> of <HI>PAYMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various devices which young men have invented to involve them&s;elves in difficulties and in ruin, none is more frequent than that of in|curring debt without any real nece&s;&s;ity. No &s;ooner his guardian and &s;uperintendants, than he becomes, in
<PB N="132" REF="140">his own idea, a man, and not only &s;o, but a man of con&s;equence, whom it behoves to dre&s;s, and make a figure. To accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e of making a figure, &s;ome expen&s;ive vices are to be affected or practi&s;ed. But as the &s;tipends of young men ju&s;t entering into life are u&s;ually incon&s;iderable, it is nece&s;&s;ary to borrow on the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous terms, or to purcha&s;e the various requi&s;ites of a plea&s;urable life on credit. The debt &s;oon accumulates from &s;mall beginnings to a great &s;um. The young adventurer continues, while his credit is good, in the &s;ame wild career; but adieu to real plea&s;ure, to improvement, to hone&s;t indu&s;try, and to a quiet mind. His peace is wounded. A perpetual load &s;eems to weigh him down; and though his feelings may, by length of time and habit, become too callous to be affected by the mi&s;ery of his &s;ituation, yet he is lo&s;t to all &s;incere enjoyment; and if he fall not a victim to de&s;pair, &s;urvives only to gain a precarious ex|i&s;tence at the gaming-table, to deceive the unwary, and to elude the re&s;earches of per&s;ecuting creditors. Even if he be enabled, by the death of his parents or rich relations, to pay the debts which his youthful folly has contracted; yet has he &s;uffered long and much, and lo&s;t the beginning of life, the &s;ea&s;on of rational delight and &s;olid improvement, in di&s;tre&s;s and fears; in fabri|cating excu&s;es and pretences, and in flying from the eager pur&s;uit of duns and bailiff&s;.</P>
<P>But this folly, however pregnant with mi&s;ery, is en|titled to pity, and may, in &s;ome degree, admit of tho&s;e u&s;ual palliations, youthful ardour, and want of experi|ence. Thou&s;ands, and tens of thou&s;ands, have ruined their fortunes and their happine&s;s by ha&s;tily running into debt before they knew the value of money, or the con|&s;equences of their embarra&s;&s;ment. We pity their mi&s;|fortune, but in the fir&s;t part of their progre&s;s we do not u&s;ually accu&s;e them of di&s;hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>But the habit of incurring debt, though in the earlier periods of life it may originate in thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, com|monly leads to a crime mo&s;t atrocious in it&s;elf, and
<PB N="133" REF="141">injurious to &s;ociety. He who prayed again&s;t poverty, le&s;s he &s;hould be poor and &s;teal, under&s;tood human na|ture. Difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es have a natural tendency to le&s;&s;en the re&s;traints of con&s;cience. The fortre&s;s of honour, when &s;tormed by that &s;ort of poverty which is occa&s;ioned by profligacy, and not defended with &s;ound principles (&s;uch as men of the world do not often po&s;|&s;e&s;s) has for the mo&s;t part yielded at di&s;cretion. He then who began with incurring debt merely becau&s;e he was &s;trongly &s;timulated by pa&s;&s;ion or fancy, and was not able to pay for their gratification, proceeds, when the habit is confirmed, and the fir&s;t &s;cruples di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to contract debt wherever un&s;u&s;pecting confidence will afford him an opportunity.</P>
<P>Many of the per&s;ons who live on the &s;ub&s;tance of others, by borrowing, purcha&s;ing, or employing, with|out intending, and without being able to pay, make a &s;plendid figure, and pa&s;s for gentlemen and men of ho|nour. But however they may felicitate them&s;elves on their &s;ucce&s;s, and in the gratification of their pride and vanity, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to pronounce them more cri|minal and dete&s;table than highwaymen and hou&s;ebreak|ers, becau&s;e, to the crime of actual theft, they add a mo&s;t ungenerous breach of confidence.</P>

<P><PB N="134" REF="142">The young fellow uttered this with an accent and a look &s;o perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I in|&s;tantly made a vow, I would give him a four-and-twenty &s;ous piece, when I got to <HI>Moulins</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;And who is <HI>poor Maria?</HI> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The love and pity of the villages around us; &s;aid the po&s;tillion&mdash;it is but three years ago, that the &s;un did not &s;hine upon &s;o fair, &s;o quick-witted, and amiable a maid; and better fate did <HI>Maria</HI> de&s;erve, than to have her banns forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the pari&s;h who publi&s;hed them&mdash;</P>
<P>He was going on, when Maria, who had made a &s;hort pau&s;e, but the pipe to her mouth, and began the air a|gain&mdash;they were the &s;ame notes,&mdash;yet were ten times &s;weeter: it is the evening &s;ervice to the virgin, &s;aid the young man&mdash;but who has taught her to play it&mdash;or how &s;he came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that Heaven has a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in both; for ever &s;ince &s;he has been un&s;ettled in her mind; it &s;eems her only con|&s;olation&mdash;&s;he was never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that &s;ervice upon it almo&s;t night and day.</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion delivered this with &s;o much di&s;cretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decypher|ing &s;omething in his face above his condition, and &s;hould have &s;ifted our his hi&s;tory, had not poor Maria's taken &s;o full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me.</P>
<P>We had got up by this time almo&s;t to the bank where Maria was &s;itting: &s;he was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two tre&s;&s;es, drawn up into a &s;ilk net, with a few olive leaves twi&s;ted a little fanta&s;tically on one &s;ide&mdash;&s;he was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an hone&s;t heart-ache, it was the moment I &s;aw her&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;God help her! poor dam&s;el: above a hundred ma&s;&s;es, &s;aid the po&s;tillion, have been &s;aid in the &s;everal pari&s;h churches and convents around, for her,&mdash;but without effect; we have &s;till hopes, as &s;he is &s;en&s;ible for &s;hort intervals, that the virgin at la&s;t will re&s;tore
<PB N="135" REF="143">her to her&s;elf; but her parents, who know her be&s;t, are hopele&s;s upon that &s;core, and think her &s;en&s;es are lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>As the po&s;tillion &s;poke this, Maria made a cadence &s;o melancholy, &s;o tender and querulous, that I &s;prung out of the chai&s;e to help her, and found my&s;elf &s;itting betwixt her and her goat before I relap&s;ed from my enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Maria looked &s;o wi&s;tfully for &s;ome time at me, and then at her goat&mdash;and then at me&mdash;and then at the goat a|gain, and &s;o on, alternately&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Well, Maria, &s;aid I &s;oftly&mdash;What re&s;emblance do you find?</P>
<P>I do intreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humble&s;t conviction of what a <HI>bea&s;t</HI> man is,&mdash;that I a&s;ked the que&s;tion; and that I would not have let fallen and un&s;ea&s;onable plea&s;antry in the vene|rable pre&s;ence of mi&s;ery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais &s;cattered&mdash;and yet I own my heart &s;mote me, and that I &s;o &s;marted at the very idea of it, that I &s;wore I would &s;et up for wi&s;dom, and utter grave &s;entences the re&s;t of may days&mdash;and never&mdash;never at|tempt again to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longe&s;t day I had to live.</P>
<P>As for writing non&s;en&s;e to them&mdash;I believe, there was a re&s;erve&mdash;but that I leave to the world.</P>
<P>Adieu, Maria! adieu, poor haple&s;s dam&s;el!&mdash;&s;ome time, but not now, I may heart thy &s;orrows from thy own lips&mdash;but I was deceived: for that moment &s;he took her pipe, and told me &s;uch a tale of woe with it, that I ro&s;e up, and with broken and irregular &s;teps, walked &s;oftly to my chai&s;e.</P>
<P>In may next journey I was prompted to go half a league out of my road to the village where her parents dwelt to enquire after her.</P>
<P>&mdash;The old mother came &s;o the door, her looks told me the &s;tory before the opened her mouth&mdash;She had
<PB N="136" REF="144">lo&s;t her hu&s;band: he had died, &s;he &s;aid, of angui&s;h, for the lo&s;s of Maria's &s;en&s;es about a month before&mdash;She had feared a fir&s;t, &s;he added, that it would have plun|dered her poor girl of what little under&s;tanding was left&mdash;but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to her&s;elf&mdash;&s;till &s;he could not re&s;t&mdash;her poor daughter, &s;he &s;aid, crying, was wandering &s;ome where about the road&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Why does my pul&s;e beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur, who&s;e heart &s;eemed only to be tuned to joy, to pa&s;s the back of his hand twice a|cro&s;s his eyes, as the woman &s;tood and told it? I beckoned to the po&s;tillion to turn back into the road.</P>
<P>When we had got within half a league of Moulins, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I di&s;covered poor Maria &s;itting under a poplar&mdash;&s;he was &s;itting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one &s;ide within her hand&mdash;a &s;mall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</P>
<P>I bid the po&s;tillion go on with the chai&s;e to Moulins&mdash;and La Fleur to be&s;peak my &s;upper&mdash;and that I would walk after him.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;&s;ed in white, and much as my friend de|&s;cribed her, except that her hair hung loo&s;e, which be|fore was twi&s;ted within a &s;ilk net.&mdash;She had, &s;uper|added likewi&s;e to her jacket, a pale green ribband, which fell acro&s;s her &s;houlder to her wai&s;t; at the end of which hung her pipe.&mdash;Her goat had been as faith|le&s;s as her lover; and &s;he had got a little dog in lieu of him, which &s;he had kept tied by a &s;tring to her gir|dle; as I looked at her dog, &s;he drew him towards her with the &s;tring&mdash;"Thou &s;halt not leave me, Sylvio," faid &s;he. I looked in Maria's eyes, and &s;aw &s;he was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat; for as &s;he uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks.</P>
<P>I &s;at down clo&s;e by her; and Maria let me wipe them away as they fell, with my handkerchief.&mdash;I then &s;teeped it in my own&mdash;and then in hers&mdash;and then in
<PB N="137" REF="145">mine&mdash;and then I wiped hers again&mdash;and as I did it, I felt &s;uch inde&s;cribable emotion within me, as I am &s;ure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</P>
<P>I am po&s;itive I have a &s;oul; nor can all the books with which materiali&s;ts have pe&s;tered the world ever convince me of the contrary.</P>
<P>When Maria had come a little to her&s;elf, I a&s;ked her if &s;he remembered a tall thin per&s;on of a man who had fat down betwixt her and her goat about two years be|fore? She &s;aid, &s;he was un&s;ettled much at that time, but remembered it upon two accounts&mdash;that ill as &s;he was, &s;he &s;aw the per&s;on pitied her; and next, and her goat had &s;tolen his handkerchief, and &s;he had beat him for the thieft&mdash;&s;he had wa&s;hed it &s;he &s;aid in the brook, and kept it ever &s;ince in her pocket to re&s;tore it to him in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee him again, which, &s;he added, he had half promi&s;ed her. As &s;he told me this, &s;he took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me &s;ee it; &s;he had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril&mdash;on opening it, I &s;aw an S marked in one of the corners.</P>
<P>She had &s;ince that, &s;he told me, &s;trayed as far as Rome, and walked round St Peter's once&mdash;and return|ed back&mdash;that &s;he found her way alone acro&s;s the A|penines&mdash;had travelled over all Lombardy without mo|ney&mdash;and through the flinty roads of Savoy without &s;hoes&mdash;how &s;he had borne it, and how &s;he had got &s;up|ported, &s;he could not tell&mdash;but <HI>God tempers the wind,</HI> &s;aid Maria, to the &s;horn lamb.</P>
<P>Shorn, indeed! and to the quick, &s;aid I; and was thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it and &s;helter thee: thou &s;hould'&s;t eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup&mdash;I would be kind to thy Sylvio&mdash;in all thy weakne&s;&s;es and wanderings I would &s;eek after thee and bring thee back&mdash;when the &s;un went down I would &s;ay my prayers, and when I had done thou &s;houlde&s;t play the evening &s;ong upon thy pipe, nor would the incen&s;e of my &s;acrifice be wor&s;e
<PB N="138" REF="146">accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Nature melted within me, as I uttered this; and Maria ob&s;erving, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was &s;teeped too much already to be of u&s;e, would needs go wa&s;h it in the &s;tream.&mdash;And where will you dry it, Maria? &s;aid I&mdash;I will dry it in my bo&s;om, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;it will do me good.</P>
<P>And is your heart &s;till &s;o warm, Maria? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>I touched upon the &s;tring on which hung all her &s;or|rows&mdash;&s;he looked with wi&s;tful di&s;order for &s;ome time in my face; and then without &s;aying any thing, took her pipe, and played her &s;ervice to the Virgin.&mdash;The &s;tring I had touched cea&s;ed to vibrate&mdash;in a moment or two Maria turned to her&s;elf&mdash;let her pipe fall&mdash;and ro&s;e up.</P>
<P>And where are you going, Maria? &s;aid I.&mdash;She &s;aid, to Moulins&mdash;Let us go, &s;aid I, together.&mdash;Ma|ria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the &s;tring to let the dog follow&mdash;in that order we entered Mou|lins.</P>
<P>Though I hate &s;alutations and greetings in the mar|ket place, yet when we got into the middle of this, I &s;topped to take my la&s;t look and la&s;t farewell of Maria.</P>
<P>Maria, though not tall, was neverthele&s;s of the fir&s;t order of fine forms&mdash;affliction had touched her looks with &s;omething that was &s;carce earthly&mdash;&s;till &s;he was feminine&mdash;and &s;o much was there about her of all that the heart wi&s;hes, or the eye looks for in wo|man, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, and tho&s;e of Eliza's out of mine, &s;he &s;hould <HI>not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup,</HI> but Maria &s;hould lie in my bo&s;om, and be unto me as a daughter.</P>
<P>Adieu, poor luckle&s;s maiden;&mdash;imbibe the oil and wine which the compa&s;&s;ion of a &s;tranger, as he jour|nieth on his way, now pours into thy wounds&mdash;that Being who has twice brui&s;ed thee, can only bind them up for ever.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> VISION <HI>of</HI> THEODORE, <HI>the</HI> HERMIT <HI>of</HI> TENERIFFE, <HI>found in his</HI> CELL.</HEAD>
<P>SON of per&s;everance, whoever thou art, who&s;e curi|o&s;ity has led thee hither, read and be wi&s;e. He that now calls upon thee is <HI>Theodore,</HI> the hermit of <HI>Te|neriffe,</HI> who, in the fifty-&s;eventh year of his retreat, left this in&s;truction to mankind, le&s;t his &s;olitary hours &s;hould be &s;pent in vain.</P>
<P>I was once what thou art now, a groveller on the earth, and a gazer at the &s;ky; I trafficked and heaped wealth together, I loved and was favoured, I wore the robe of honour and heard the mu&s;ic of adulation; I was ambitious, and ro&s;e to greatne&s;s; I was unhappy, and retired. I &s;ought for &s;ome time what I at length found here, a place where all real wants might be ea&s;ily &s;up|plied, and where I might not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men by the toleration of their follies. Here I &s;aw fruits and herbs and water, and here determined to wait the hand of death, which I hope, when at la&s;t it comes, will fall lightly on me.</P>
<P>Forty-eight years had I now pa&s;&s;ed in forgetfulne&s;s of all mortal cares, and without any inclination to wan|der farther than the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring &s;u&s;tenance required; but as I &s;tood one day beholding the rock that overhangs my cell, I found in my&s;elf a de&s;ire to climb it; and when I was on its top, was in the &s;ame man|ner determined to &s;cale the next, till by degrees I con|ceived a wi&s;h to view the &s;ummit of the mountain, at the foot of which I had &s;o long re&s;ided. This motion of my thoughts I endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s, not be|cau&s;e it appeared criminal, but becau&s;e it was new; and all change not evidently for the better alarms a mind taught by experience to di&s;tru&s;t it&s;elf. I was often afraid that my heart was deceiving me, that my impatience of confinement ro&s;e from &s;ome earthly
<PB N="140" REF="148">pa&s;&s;ion, and that my ardour to &s;urvey the works of na|ture was only a hidden longing to mingle once again in the &s;cenes of life. I therefore endeavoured to &s;et|tle my thoughts into their former &s;tate, but found their di&s;traction every day greater. I was always reproach|ing my&s;elf with the want of happine&s;s within my reach, and at la&s;t began to que&s;tion whether it was not lazi|ne&s;s rather than caution that re&s;trained me from climb|ing to the &s;ummit of <HI>Teneriffe.</HI></P>
<P>I ro&s;e therefore before the day, and began my jour|ney up the &s;teep of the mountain; but I had not ad|vanced far, old as I was and burthened with provi&s;ions, when the day began to &s;hine upon me; the declivities grew more precipitous, and the &s;and &s;liding beneath my feet; at la&s;t, fainting with labour, I arrived at a &s;mall plain almo&s;t inclo&s;ed by rocks, and open only to the ea&s;t. I &s;at down to re&s;t a while, in full per&s;ua&s;ion that when I had recovered my &s;trength I &s;hould proceed on my de&s;ign; but when once I had ta&s;ted ea&s;e, I found many rea&s;ons again&s;t di&s;turbing it. The branches &s;pread a &s;hade over my head, and the gales of &s;pring wafted odours to my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>As I &s;at thus, forming alternately excu&s;es for de|lay, and re&s;olutions to go forward, an irre&s;i&s;tible heavi|ne&s;s &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed me; I laid my head upon the bank, and re&s;igned my&s;elf to &s;leep: when methought I heard the &s;ound as of the flight of eagles, and a being of more than human dignity &s;tood before me. While I was deliberating how to addre&s;s him, he took me by the hand with an air of kindne&s;s, and a&s;ked me &s;olemn|ly, but without &s;everity. <Q><HI>Theodore,</HI> whither art thou going?</Q> I am climbing, an&s;wered I, to the top of the mountain, to enjoy a more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the works of nature. <Q>Attend fir&s;t, &s;aid he, to the pro&s;pect which this place affords, and what thou do&s;t not under&s;tand I will explain. I am one of the be|nevolent beings who watch over the children of the du&s;t, to pre&s;erve them from tho&s;e evils which will not ultimately terminate in good, and which they do
<PB N="141" REF="149">not, by their own faults, bring upon them&s;elves. Look round therefore without fear; ob&s;erve, con|template, and be in&s;tructed.</Q></P>
<P>Encouraged by this a&s;&s;urance, I looked and beheld a mountain higher than <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> to the &s;ummit of which the human eye could never reach; when I had tired my&s;elf with gazing upon its height, I turned my eyes towards its foot, which I could ea&s;ily di&s;cover, but was amazed to find it without foundation, and placed incon|ceivably in emptine&s;s and darkne&s;s. Thus I &s;tood ter|rified and confu&s;ed; above were tracks in&s;crutable, and below was total vacuity. But my protector, with a voice of admonition, cried out, <HI>Theodore,</HI> be not affrighted, but rai&s;e thy eyes again; the <HI>Mountain</HI> of <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> is before thee, &s;urvey it and be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I then looked with more deliberate attention, and ob&s;erved the bottom of the mountain to be of gentle ri&s;e, and over&s;pread with flowers; the middle to be more &s;teep, embarra&s;&s;ed with crags, and interrupted by precipices, over which hung branches loaded with fruits, and among which were &s;cattered palaces and bowers. The tracts which my eye could reach neare&s;t the top were generally barren; but there were among the clefts of the rocks a few hardy evergreens, which, though they did not give much plea&s;ure to the &s;ight or &s;mell, yet &s;eemed to cheer the labour and facilitate the &s;teps of tho&s;e who were clambering among them.</P>
<P>Then, beginning to examine more minutely the dif|ferent parts, I ob&s;erved at a great di&s;tance a multitude of both &s;exes i&s;&s;uing into view from the bottom of the mountain. Their fir&s;t actions I could not accurately di&s;cern; but, as they every moment approached nearer, I found that they amu&s;ed them&s;elves with gathering flowers under the &s;uperintendence of a mode&s;t virgin in a white robe, who &s;eemed not over &s;olicitous to con|fine them to any &s;ettled pace or certain track; for &s;he knew that the whole ground was &s;mooth and &s;olid, and that they could not be ea&s;ily hurt or bewildered. When, as it often happened, they plucked a thi&s;tle for a flower,
<PB N="142" REF="150">INNOCENCE, &s;o was &s;he called, would &s;mile at the mi&s;take. Happy, &s;aid I, are they who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re under &s;o gentle a government, and yet are &s;afe. But I had not opportunity to dwell long on the con&s;ideration of their felicity; for I found that INNOCENCE continued her attendance but a little way, and &s;eemed to con&s;ider only the flowery bottom of the mountain as her proper province. Tho&s;e whom &s;he abandoned &s;carcely knew that they were left, before they perceived them&s;elves in the hands of EDUCATION, a nymph more &s;evere in her a&s;pect and imperious in her commands, who con|fined them to certain paths, in their opinion too nar|row and too rough. The&s;e they were continually &s;o|licited to leave, by APPETITE, whom EDUCATION could never fright away, though &s;he &s;ometimes awed her to &s;uch timidity, that the effects of her pre&s;ence were &s;carcely perceptible. Some went back to the fir&s;t part of the mountain, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of continuing bu&s;ied in plucking flowers, but were no longer guarded by INNOCENCE; and &s;uch as EDUCATION could not force back, proceeded up the mountain by &s;ome miry road, in which they were &s;eldom &s;een, and &s;carcely ever regarded.</P>
<P>As EDUCATION led her troop up the mountain, no|thing was more ob&s;ervable than that &s;he was frequently giving them cautions to beware of HABITS; and was calling out to one or another at every &s;tep, that a HA|BIT was en&s;naring them; that they would be under the dominion of HABIT before they perceived their danger; and that tho&s;e whom HABIT &s;hould once &s;ub|due, had little hope of regaining their liberty.</P>
<P>Of this caution, &s;o frequently repeated, I was very &s;olicitous to know the rea&s;on, when my protector di|rected my regard to a troop of pygmies, which ap|peared to walk &s;ilently before that were climbing the mountain, and each to &s;mooth the way before her follower. I found that I had mi&s;&s;ed the notice of them before, both becau&s;e they were &s;o minute as not ea&s;ily to be di&s;cerned, and becau&s;e they grew every moment
<PB N="143" REF="151">nearer in their colour to the objects with which they were &s;urrounded. As the followers of EDUCATION did not appear &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ence of the&s;e danger|ous a&s;&s;ociates, or, ridiculing their diminutive &s;ize, did not think it po&s;&s;ible that human beings &s;hould ever be brought into &s;ubjection by &s;uch feeble enemies, they generally heard her precepts of vigilance with wonder: and, when they thought her eye withdrawn, treated them with contempt. Nor could I my&s;elf think her cautions &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as her frequent inculcations &s;eem|ed to &s;uppo&s;e, till I ob&s;erved that each of the&s;e petty beings held &s;ecretly a chain in her hand, with which &s;he prepared to bind tho&s;e whom &s;he found within her power. Yet the&s;e HABITS under the eye of EDUCA|TION went quietly forward, and &s;eemed very little to increa&s;e in bulk or &s;trength; for though they were al|ways willing to join with APPETITE, yet when EDU|CATION kept them apart from her, they would very punctually obey command, and make the narrow very in which they were confined ea&s;ier and &s;moother.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;ervable, that their &s;tature was never at a &s;tand, but continually growing or decrea&s;ing, yet not always in the &s;ame proportions: nor could I forbear to expre&s;s my admiration, when I &s;aw in how much le&s;s time they generally gained than lo&s;t bulk. Though they grew &s;lowly in the road of EDUCATION, it might however be perceived that they grew; but if they once deviated at the call of APPETITE, their &s;tature &s;oon became gigantic; and their &s;trength was &s;uch, that EDUCATION pointed out to her tribe many that were led in chains by them, whom &s;he could never more re&s;|cue from their &s;lavery. She pointed them out, but with little effect; for all her pupils appeared confident of their own &s;uperiority to the &s;tronge&s;t HABIT, and &s;ome &s;eemed in &s;ecret to regret that they were hindered from following the triumph of APPETITE.</P>
<P>It was the peculiar artifice of HABIT not to &s;uffer her power to be felt at fir&s;t. Tho&s;e whom &s;he led, &s;he had the addre&s;s of appearing only to attend, but was
<PB N="144" REF="152">continually doubling her chains upon her companions; which were &s;o &s;lender in them&s;elves, and &s;o &s;ilently fa&s;tened, that while the attention was engaged by o|ther objects, they were not ea&s;ily perceived. Each link grew tighter as it had been longer worn; and when by continual additions they became &s;o heavy as to be felt, they were very frequently to &s;trong to be broken.</P>
<P>When EDUCATION had proceeded in this manner to the part of the mountain where the declivity began to be craggy, &s;he re&s;igned her charge to two powers of &s;upe|rior a&s;pect. The meaner of them appeared capable of pre&s;iding in &s;enates, or governing nations, and yet watched the &s;teps of the other with the mo&s;t anxious attention, and was vi&s;ibly confounded and perplexed if ever &s;he &s;uffered her regard to be drawn away. The other &s;eemed to approve her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as plea&s;ing, but with &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion as plainly &s;hewed that &s;he claimed it as due: and indeed &s;o great was her dignity and &s;weetne&s;s, that he who would not reverence, mu&s;t not behold her.</P>
<P><HI>"Theodone,"</HI> &s;aid my protector, <Q>be fearle&s;s, and be wi&s;e; approach the&s;e powers, who&s;e dominion ex|tends to all the remaining part of the <HI>Mountain</HI> of <HI>Exi&s;tence.</HI></Q> I trembled, and ventured to addre&s;s the inferior nymph, who&s;e eyes, though piercing and aw|ful, I was not able to &s;u&s;tain. "Bright power," &s;aid I, <Q> by whatever name it is lawful to addre&s;s thee, tell me, thou who pre&s;ide&s;t here, on what condition thy protection will be granted?</Q> "It will be granted," &s;aid &s;he; <Q>only to obedience. I am REASON, of all &s;ubordinate beings the noble&s;t and the greate&s;t; who, if thou my receive my laws, will regard thee like the re&s;t of my votaries, by conducting thee to RELIGION.</Q> Charmed by her voice and a&s;pect, I profe&s;&s;ed my readine&s;s to follow her. She then pre|&s;ented me to her mi&s;tre&s;s, who looked upon me with tenderne&s;s. I bowed before her, and &s;he &s;miled.</P>
<P>When EDUCATION delivered up tho&s;e for who&s;e happine&s;s &s;he had been &s;o long &s;olicitous, &s;he &s;eemed to expect that they &s;hould expre&s;s &s;ome gratitude for her
<PB N="145" REF="153">care, or &s;ome regret at the lo&s;s of that protection which &s;he had hitherto afforded them. But it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover, by the alacrity which broke out at her de|parture, that her pre&s;ence had been long di&s;plea&s;ing, and that &s;he had been teaching tho&s;e who felt in them|&s;elves no want of in&s;truction. They all agreed in re|joicing that they &s;hould no longer be &s;ubject to her ca|prices, or di&s;turbed by her documents, but &s;hould be now under the direction of REASON, to whom they made no doubt of being able to recommend them&s;elves by a &s;teady adherence to all her precepts. REASON coun&s;elled them, at their fir&s;t entrance upon her pro|vince, to inli&s;t them&s;elves among the votaries of RELI|GION; and informed them, that if they tru&s;ted to her alone, they would find the &s;ame fate with her other admirers, whom &s;he had not been able to &s;ecure again&s;t APPETITE and PASSION, and who, having been &s;eized by HABIT in the regions of DESIRE, had been dragged away to the caverns of DESPAIR. Her ad|monition was vain; the greater number declared again&s;t any other direction, and doubted not but by her &s;u|perintendency they &s;hould climb with &s;afety up the <HI>Mountain</HI> of <HI>Exi&s;tence.</HI> "My power," &s;aid REASON, <Q>is to advi&s;e, not to compel; I have already told you the danger of your choice. The path &s;eems now plain and even, but there are a&s;perities and pitfalls, over which RELIGION only can conduct you. Look upwards, and you will perceive a mi&s;t before you &s;et|tled upon the highe&s;t vi&s;ible part of the mountain; a mi&s;t by which my pro&s;pect is terminated, and which is pierced only by the eyes of RELIGION. Beyond it are the temples of HAPPINESS, in which tho&s;e who climb the precipice by her direction, after the toil of pilgrimage, repo&s;e for ever. I know not the way, and therefore can only conduct you to a better guide. PRIDE has &s;ometimes reproached me with the nar|rowne&s;s of my view, but, when &s;he endeavoured to extend it, could only &s;hew me, below the mi&s;t, the bowers of CONTENT; even they vani&s;hed as I fixed
<PB N="146" REF="154">my eyes upon them; and tho&s;e whom &s;he per&s;uaded to travel towards them were enchained by HABIT, and ingulfed by DESPAIR, a cruel tyrant, who&s;e ca|verns are beyond the darkne&s;s on the right &s;ide and on the left, from who&s;e pri&s;ons none can e&s;cape, and whom I cannot teach you to avoid.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the declaration of REASON to tho&s;e who demanded her protection. Some that recollected the dictates of EDUCATION, finding them now &s;econded by another authority, &s;ubmitted with reluctance to the &s;trict decree, and engaged them&s;elves among the followers of RELIGION, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the uniformity of their march, without appearing to re|gard the pro&s;pects which at every &s;tep courted their attention.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The <HI>VISION</HI> of <HI>THEODORE</HI> continued.</HEAD>
<P>ALL tho&s;e who determined to follow either REA|SON or RELIGION, were continually importuned to for&s;ake the road, &s;ometimes by the PASSIONS, and &s;ometimes by the APPETITES, of whom both had rea|&s;on to boa&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of their artifices; for &s;o many were drawn into by-paths, that any way was more popu|lous than the right. The attacks of the APPETITES were more impetuous, tho&s;e of the PASSIONS longer con|tinued. The APPETITES turned their followers direct|ly from the true way, but the PASSIONS marched at fir&s;t in a path nearly in the &s;ame direction with that of REASON and RELIGION; but deviated by &s;low de|grees, till at la&s;t they entirely changed their cour&s;e.&mdash;APPETITE drew a&s;ide the dull, and PASSION the &s;prightly. Of the APPETITES, LUST was the &s;tronge&s;t; and of the PASSIONS, VANITY. The mo&s;t powerful
<PB N="147" REF="155">a&s;&s;ault was to be feared, when a PASSION and an AP|PETITE joined their enticements; and the path of REASON was be&s;t followed, when a pa&s;&s;ion called to one &s;ide, and an appetite to the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;educers had the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s upon the fol|lowers of REASON, over whom they &s;carcely ever failed to prevail, except when they counteracted one another. They had not the &s;ame triumphs over the votaries of RELIGION; for though they were often led a&s;ide for a time, RELIGION commonly recalled them by her e|mi&s;&s;ary CONSCIENCE, before HABIT had time to en|chain them. But they that profe&s;&s;ed to obey REASON, if once they for&s;ook her, &s;eldom returned; for &s;he had no me&s;&s;enger to &s;ummon them but PRIDE, who generally betrayed her confidence, and employed all her &s;kill to &s;upport PASSION; and if ever &s;he did her duty, was found unable to prevail, if HABIT had interpo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found that the great danger to the followers of RELIGION was only from HABIT; every other power was ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;ted, nor did they find any difficulty when any inadvertently quitted her, to find her again by the direction of CONSCIENCE, unle&s;s they had given time to HABIT to draw her chain behind them, and bar up the way by which they had wandered. Of &s;ome of tho&s;e, the condition was ju&s;tly to be pitied, who turned at every call of CONSCIENCE, and tried, but without effect, to bur&s;t the chains of HABIT: They &s;aw RELIGION walking forward at a di&s;tance, &s;aw her with reverence, and longed to join her; but were, whenever they approached her, with-held by HABIT, and langui&s;hed in &s;ordid bondage, which they could not e&s;cape, though they &s;corned and hated it.</P>
<P>It was evident that the HABITS were &s;o far from growing weaker by the&s;e repeated conte&s;ts, that if they were not totally overcome, every &s;truggle enlarged their bulk and increa&s;ed their &s;trength; and a HABIT, op|po&s;ed and victorious, was more than twice as &s;trong as before the conte&s;t. The manner in which tho&s;e who were weary of their tyranny endeavoured to e&s;cape from
<PB N="148" REF="156">them, appeared by the event to be generally wrong; they tried to loo&s;e their chains one by one, and to re|treat by the &s;ame degrees as they advanced; but before the deliverance was completed, HABIT always threw new chains upon her fugitive: nor did any e&s;cape her but tho&s;e who, by an effort &s;udden and violent, bur&s;t their &s;hackles at once, and left her at a di&s;tance; and even of the&s;e, many, ru&s;hing too precipitately forward, and hindered by their terrors from &s;topping where they were &s;afe, were fatigued with their own vehemence, and re&s;igned them&s;elves again to that power from whom an e&s;cape mu&s;t be &s;o dearly bought, and who&s;e tyranny was little felt, except when it was re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Some however there always were, who, when they found HABIT prevailing over them, called upon REA|SON or RELIGION for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; each of them will|ingly came to the &s;uccour of her &s;uppliant; but neither with the &s;ame &s;trength, nor the &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. HABIT, in&s;olent with her power, would often pre&s;ume to par|ley with REASON, and offer to loo&s;e &s;ome of her chains if the re&s;t might remain. To this REASON, who was never certain of victory, frequently con&s;ented, but al|ways found her conce&s;&s;ion de&s;tructive, and &s;aw the caprice led away by HABIT to his former &s;lavery.&mdash;RELIGION never &s;ubmitted to treaty, but held out her hand with certainty of conque&s;t; and, if the captive to whom &s;he gave it did not quit his hold, always led him in triumph, and placed him in the direct path to the temple of <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> where REASON never failed to congratulate his deliverance, and encourage his adhe|rence to that power to who&s;e timely &s;uccour he was indebted for it.</P>
<P>When the traveller was again placed in the road of <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> I &s;aw HABIT again gliding before him, but reduced to the &s;tate of a dwarf, without &s;trength and without activity; but when the PASSIONS or APPE|TITES, which had before &s;educed him, made their ap|proach, HABIT would on a &s;udden &s;tart into &s;ize, and with unexpected violence pu&s;h him towards them.&mdash;
<PB N="149" REF="157">The wretch, thus impelled on one &s;ide, and allured on the other, too frequently quitted the road of <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> to which, after his &s;econd deviation from it, he rarely returned. But, by a timely call on RELIGION, the force of HABIT was eluded, her attackes grew fainter, and at la&s;t her corre&s;pondence with the enemy was en|tirely de&s;troyed. She then began to employ tho&s;e re&s;t|le&s;s; faculties in compliance with the power which &s;he could not overcome; and as &s;he grew again in &s;tature and in &s;trength, cleared away the a&s;perities of the road of <HI>Happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>From this road I could not ea&s;ily withdraw my atten|tion, becau&s;e all who travelled it appeared chearful and &s;atisfied; and the farther they proceeded, the greater appeared their alacrity, and the &s;tronger their convic|tion of the wi&s;dom of their guide. Some, who had never deviated but by &s;hort excur&s;ions, had HABIT in the middle of their pa&s;&s;age vigorou&s;ly &s;upporting them, and driving off the APPETITES and PASSIONS which attempted to interrupt their progre&s;s. Others, who had entered this road late, or had long for&s;aken it, were toiling on without her help at lea&s;t, and commonly a|gain&s;t her endeavours. But I ob&s;erved, when they ap|proached to the barren top, that few were able to pro|ceed without &s;ome &s;upport from HABIT; and that they, who&s;e HABITS were &s;trong, advanced towards the mi&s;ts with little emotion, and entered them at la&s;t with calmne&s;s and confidence; after which, they were &s;een only by the eye of RELIGION; and though REA|SON looked after them with the mo&s;t earne&s;t curio&s;ity, &s;he could only obtain a faint glimp&s;e, when her mi&s;tre&s;s, to enlarge her pro&s;pect, rai&s;ed her from the ground.&mdash;REASON, however, di&s;cerned that they were &s;afe, but RELIGION &s;aw that they were happy.</P>
<P>"Now, <HI>Theodore,</HI>" &s;aid my protector, <Q>withdraw thy view from the regions of ob&s;curity, and &s;ee the fate of tho&s;e who, when they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by E|DUCATION, would admit no direction but that of REASON. Survey their wanderings, and be wi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="158">I looked then upon the road of REASON, which was indeed, &s;o far as it reached, the &s;ame with that of RE|LIGION, nor had REASON di&s;covered it but by her in|&s;truction. Yet when &s;he had once been taught it, &s;he clearly &s;aw it was right; and PRIDE had &s;ometimes in|cited her to declare that &s;he di&s;covered it her&s;elf, and per&s;uaded her to offer her&s;elf as a guide to RELIGION; whom, after many vain experiments, &s;he found it her highe&s;t privilege to follow. REASON was however at la&s;t well in&s;tructed in part of the way, and appeared to teach it with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, when her precepts were not mi&s;repre&s;ented by PASSION, or her influence overborne by APPETITE. But neither of the&s;e enemies was &s;he able to re&s;i&s;t. When PASSION &s;eized upon her votaries, &s;he &s;eldom attempted oppo&s;ition: &s;he &s;eemed indeed to contend with more vigour again&s;t APPETITE, but was generally overwearied in the conte&s;t; and if either of her opponents had confederated with HABIT, her authority was wholly at an end. When HABIT en|deavoured to captivate the votaries of RELIGION, &s;he grew by &s;low degrees, and gave time to e&s;cape; but in &s;eizing the unhappy followers of REASON, &s;he proceed|ed as one that had nothing to fear, and enlarged her &s;ize, and doubled her chains without intermi&s;&s;ion, and without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who for&s;ook the directions of REASON, &s;ome were led a&s;ide by the whi&s;pers of AMBITION, who was perpetually pointing to &s;tately palaces, &s;ituated on eminences on either &s;ide, recounting the delights of affluence, and boa&s;ting the &s;ecurity of power. They were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to follow her, and HABIT quickly threw her chains upon them; they were &s;oon convinc|ed of the folly of their choice, but few of them at|tempted to return. AMBITION led them forward from precipice to precipice, where many fell and were &s;een no more. Tho&s;e that e&s;caped were, after a long &s;eries of hazards, generally delivered over to TYRANNY, where they continued to heap up gold till their patrons
<PB N="151" REF="159">or their heirs pu&s;hed them headlong at la&s;t in the ca|verns of DESPAIR.</P>
<P>Others were inticed by INTEMPERANCE to ramble in &s;earch of tho&s;e fruits that hung over the rock, and filled the air with their fragrance. I ob&s;erved, that the HABITS which hovered about the&s;e &s;oon grew to an enormous &s;ize, nor were there any who le&s;s attempted to return to REASON, or &s;ooner &s;unk into the gulphs that lay before them. When the&s;e fir&s;t quitted the road, REASON looked after them with a frown of con|tempt, but had little expectations of being able to re|claim them; for the bowl of intoxication was of &s;uch qualities as to make them lo&s;e all regard but for the pre&s;ent moment; neither HOPE nor FEAR could enter their retreats; and HABIT had &s;o ab&s;olute a power, that even CONSCIENCE, if RELIGION had employed her in their favour, would not have been able to force an entrance.</P>
<P>There were others who&s;e crime it was rather to neg|lect REASON than to obey her; and who retreated from the heat and tumult of the way, not to the bow|ers of INTEMPERANCE, but to the maze of INDO|LENCE. They had this peculiarity in their condition, that they were always in &s;ight of the road of REASON, always wi&s;hing for her pre&s;ence, and always re&s;olving to return to-morrow. In the&s;e was mo&s;t eminently con&s;picuous the &s;ubtlety of HABIT, who hung imper|ceptible &s;hackles upon them, and was every moment leading them farther from the road, which they always imagined that they had the power of reaching. They wandered on from one double of the labyrinth to another with the chains of HABIT hanging &s;ecretly upon them, till, as they advanced, the flowers grew paler, and the &s;cents fainter; they proceeded in their dreary march without plea&s;ure in their progre&s;s, yet without power to return; and had this aggravation above all others, that they were criminal but not de|lighted. They drunkard for a time laughed over his wine; the ambitious man triumphed in the mi&s;car|riage
<PB N="152" REF="160">of his rival; but the captives of INDOLENCE had neither &s;uperiority nor merriment. DISCON|TENT lowered in their looks, and SADNESS hovered round their &s;hades; yet they crawled on, reluctant and gloomy, till they arrived at the depth of the rece&s;s, va|ried only with poppies and night&s;hade, where the do|minion of INDOLENCE terminates, and the hopele&s;s wanderer is delivered up to MELANCHOLY: the chains of HABIT are riveted for ever; and MELANCHOLY, having tortured her pri&s;oner for a time, con&s;igns him at la&s;t to the cruelty of DESPAIR.</P>
<P>While I was mu&s;ing on this mi&s;erable &s;cene, my pro|tector called out to me, "Remember, <HI>Theodore,</HI> and be "wi&s;e, and let not HABIT prevail again&s;t thee" I &s;tarted, and beheld my&s;elf &s;urrounded by the rocks of <HI>Teneriffe;</HI> the birds of light were &s;inging in the trees, and the glances of the morning darted upon me.</P>

<HEAD>SIR BERTRAND. <HI>A Fragment.</HI></HEAD>
<P>&mdash;SIR Bertrand turned his &s;teed towards the woulds, hoping to cro&s;s the&s;e dreary moors before the curfew. But ere he had proceeded half his journey, he was bewildered by the different tracks; and not being able, as far as the eye could reach, to e&s;py any object but the brown heath &s;ur|rounding him, he was at length quite uncertain which way he &s;hould direct his cour&s;e. Night overtook him in this &s;ituation. It was one of tho&s;e nights when the moon gives a faint glimmering of light through the thick black clouds of a lowering &s;ky. Now and then &s;he &s;uddenly emerged in full &s;plendour from her veil, and then in&s;tantly retired behind it; having ju&s;t &s;erved to give the forlorn Sir Bertrand a wide extended pro&s;|pect over the de&s;olate wa&s;te. Hope and native cou|rage
<PB N="153" REF="161">awhile urged him to pu&s;h forwards, but at length the increa&s;ing darkne&s;s and fatigue of body and mind overcame him; he dreaded moving from the ground he &s;tood on, for fear of unknown pits and bogs; and alighting from his hor&s;e in de&s;pair, he threw him&s;elf on the ground. He had not long continued in that po&s;ture, when the &s;ullen toll of a di&s;tant bell &s;truck his ears&mdash;he &s;tarted up, and turning towards the &s;ound, di&s;cerned a dim twinkling light. In&s;tantly he &s;eized his hor&s;e's bridle, and with cautious &s;teps advan|ced towards it. After a painful march, he was &s;top|ped by a moated ditch, &s;urrounding the place from whence the light proceeded; and by a momentary glimp&s;e of the moon-light he had a full view of a large antique man&s;ion, with turrets at the corners, and an ample porch in the centre. The injuries of time were &s;trongly marked on every thing about it. The roof in various places was fallen in, the battlements were half demoli&s;hed, and the windows broken and di&s;mantled. A draw-bridge, with a ruinous gate-way at each end, led to the court before the building.&mdash;He entered, and in&s;tantly the light, which proceeded from a window in one of the turrets, glided along and vani&s;hed; at the &s;ame moment the moon &s;unk beneath a black cloud, and the night was darker than ever. All was &s;ilent&mdash;Sir Bertrand fa&s;tened his &s;teed under a &s;hed, and ap|proaching the hou&s;e, traver&s;ed its whole front with light and &s;low foot&s;teps&mdash;All was &s;till as death&mdash;He looked in at the lower windows, but could not di&s;tin|gui&s;h a &s;ingle object through the impenetrable gloom. After a &s;hort parley with him&s;elf, he entered the porch, and &s;eizing a ma&s;&s;y iron knocker at the gate, lifted it up, and he&s;itating, at length &s;truck a loud &s;troke&mdash;the noi&s;e re&s;ounded through the whole man&s;ion with hollow echoes. All was &s;till again&mdash;he repeated the &s;trokes more boldly and louder&mdash;another interval of &s;ilence en&s;ued&mdash;A third time he knocked, and a third time all was &s;till. He then &s;ell back to &s;ome di&s;tance, that he might di&s;cern whether any light could be &s;een
<PB N="154" REF="162">in the whole front&mdash;It again appeared in the &s;ame place, and quickly glided away, as before&mdash;at the &s;ame in&s;tant a deep &s;ullen toll &s;ounded from the turret. Sir Bertrand's heart made a fearful &s;top&mdash;he was a while motionle&s;s; then terror impelled him to make &s;ome ha&s;ty &s;teps towards his &s;teed&mdash;but &s;hame &s;topt his flight; and urged by honour, and a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of fi|ni&s;hing the adventure, he returned to the porch; and working up his &s;oul to a full &s;teadine&s;s of re&s;olution, he drew forth his &s;word with one hand, and with the other lifted up the latch of the gate. The heavy door, creaking upon its hinges, reluctantly yielded to his hand&mdash;he applied his &s;houlder to it, and forced it open&mdash;he quitted it, and &s;tept forward&mdash;the door in&s;tantly &s;hut with a thundering clap. Sir Bertrand's blood was chilled&mdash;he turned back to find the door, and it was long ere his trembling hands could &s;eize it&mdash;but his utmo&s;t &s;trength could not open it again. After &s;e|veral ineffectual attempts, he looked behind him, and beheld, acro&s;s a hall, upon a large &s;tair-ca&s;e, a pale-blui&s;h flame, which ca&s;t a di&s;mal gleam of light around. He again &s;ummoned forth his courage, and advanced towards it&mdash;it retired. He came to the foot of the &s;tairs, and after a moment's deliberation a&s;cended. He went &s;lowly up, the flame retiring before him, till he came to a wide gallery&mdash;The flame proceeded along it, and he followed in &s;ilent horror, treading lightly, for the echoes of his foot&s;teps &s;tartled him. It led him to the foot of another &s;tair-ca&s;e, and then vani&s;hed&mdash;At the &s;ame in&s;tant another toll &s;ounded from the turret&mdash;Sir Bertrand felt it &s;trike upon his heart. He was now in total darkne&s;s, and, with his arms extended, began to a&s;cend the &s;econd &s;tair-ca&s;e. A dead cold hand met his left hand, and firmly gra&s;ped it, drawing him forcibly forwards&mdash;he endeavoured to di&s;engage him&s;elf, but could not&mdash;he made a furious blow with his &s;word, and in&s;tantly a loud &s;hriek pierced his ears, and the dead hand was left powerle&s;s with his&mdash;He dropt it, and ru&s;hed forwards with a de&s;perate valour.
<PB N="155" REF="163">The &s;tairs were narrow and winding, and interrupted by frequent breaches, and loo&s;e fragments of &s;tone. The &s;tair-ca&s;e grew narrower and narrower, and at length terminated in a low iron grate. Sir Bertrand pu&s;hed it open&mdash;it led to an intricate winding pa&s;&s;age, ju&s;t large enough to admit a per&s;on upon his hands and knees. A &s;aint glimmering of light &s;erved to &s;hew the nature of the place&mdash;Sir Bertrand entered&mdash;A deep hollow groan re&s;ounded from a di&s;tance through the vault&mdash;He went forwards, and proceeding beyond the fir&s;t turning, he di&s;cerned the &s;ame blue flame which had before conducted him&mdash;He followed it. The vault, at length, &s;uddenly opened into a lofty gallery, in the mid&s;t of which a figure appeared, compleatly armed, thru&s;ting forwards the bloody &s;tump of a arm, with a terrible frown and menacing ge&s;ture, and bran|di&s;hing a &s;word in his hand. Sir Bertrand undaunted|ly &s;prung forwards; and aiming a fierce blow at the figure, it in&s;tantly vani&s;hed, letting fall a ma&s;&s;y iron key. The flame now re&s;ted upon a pair of ample fold|ing doors at the end of the gallery. Sir Bertrand went up to it, and applied the key to a brazen lock&mdash;with difficulty he turned the bolt&mdash;in&s;tantly the doors flew open, and di&s;covered a large apartment, at the end of which was a coffin re&s;ted upon a bier, with a taper burning on each &s;ide of it. Along the room, on both &s;ides, were gigantic &s;tatues of black marble, attired in the Moori&s;h habit, and holding enormous &s;abres in their right hands. Each of them reared his arm, and advanced one leg forwards, as the knight entered; at the &s;ame moment the lid of the coffin flew open, and the bell tolled. The flame &s;till glided forwards, and Sir Bertrand re&s;olutely followed, till he arrived within &s;ix paces of the coffin. Suddenly a lady in a &s;hroud and black veil ro&s;e up in it, and &s;tretched out her arms towards him&mdash;at the &s;ame time the &s;tatues cla&s;hed their &s;abres and advanced. Sir Bertrand &s;lew to the lady, and cla&s;ped her in his arms&mdash;&s;he threw up her veil, and ki&s;&s;ed his lips; and in&s;tantly the whole building.

Sir Bertrand was thrown into a &s;ud|den trance, and on recovering found him&s;elf &s;eated on a velvet &s;ofa, in the mo&s;t magnificent room he had ever &s;een, lighted with innumerable tapers, in lu&s;tres of pure cry&s;tal. A &s;umptuous banquet was &s;et in the middle. The doors opening to &s;oft mu&s;ic, a lady of incomparable beauty, attired with amazing &s;plendour, entered, &s;urrounded by a troop of gay nymphs more fair than the Graces&mdash;She advanced to the knight, and falling on her knees, thanked him as her deliverer. The nymphs placed a garland of laurel upon his head, and the lady led him by the hand to the banquet, and &s;at be&s;ide him. The nymphs placed them&s;elves at the table, and a numerous train of &s;ervants entering, &s;erved up the fea&s;t: delicious mu&s;ic playing all the time. Sir Bertrand could not &s;peak for a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;he could only return their honours by courteous looks and ge&s;|tures.

<HEAD>Learning &s;hould be &s;ometimes applied to cultivate our Morals.</HEAD>
<P>ENVY, curio&s;ity, and our &s;en&s;e of the imperfection of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, inclines us always to e&s;timate the advantages which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others a|bove
<PB N="157" REF="165">their real value. Every one mu&s;t have remarked what powers and prerogatives the vulgar imagine to be conferred by learning. A man of &s;cience is expect|ed to excel the unlettered and unenlightened, even on occa&s;ions where literature is of no u&s;e, and among weak minds lo&s;es part of his reverence by di&s;covering no &s;uperiority in tho&s;e parts of life, in which all are unavoidably equal; as when a monarch makes a pro|gre&s;s to the remoter provinces, the ru&s;tics are &s;aid &s;ometimes to wonder that they find him of the &s;ame &s;ize with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e demands of prejudice and folly can never be &s;atisfied, and therefore many of the imputations which learning &s;uffers from di&s;appointed ignorance, are with|out reproach. Yet it cannot be denied, that there are &s;ome failures to which men of &s;tudy are peculiarly ex|po&s;ed. Every condition has its di&s;advantages. The circle of knowledge is too wide for the mo&s;t active and diligent intellect, and while &s;cience is pur&s;ued with ardour, other accompli&s;hments of equal u&s;e are nece&s;&s;a|rily neglected; as a &s;mall garri&s;on mu&s;t leave one part of an exten&s;ive fortre&s;s naked, when an alarm calls them to another.</P>
<P>The learned, however, might generally &s;upport their dignity with more &s;ucce&s;s, if they &s;uffered not them|&s;elves to be mi&s;-led by &s;uperfluous attainments of qua|lification which few can under&s;tand or value, and by which they may &s;ink into the grave without any con|&s;picuous opportunities of exerting. Raphael, in re|turn to Adam's enquiries into the cour&s;es of the &s;tars and the revolutions of heaven, coun&s;els him to with|draw his mind from idle &s;peculations, and, in&s;tead of watching motions which he has no power to regulate, to employ his faculties upon nearer and more intere&s;t|ing objects, the &s;urvey of his own life, the &s;ubjection of his pa&s;&s;ions, the knowledge of duties which mu&s;t daily be performed, and the detection of dangers which mu&s;t daily be incurred.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> MELISSA.</HEAD>
<P>THE father of MELISSA was the younger &s;on of a country gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate of a|bout five hundred a year; but as this was to be the in|heritance of the elder brother, and as there were three &s;i&s;ters to be provided for, he was at about &s;ixteen, taken from Eton &s;chool, and apprenticed to a con&s;iderable merchant at Bri&s;tol. The young gentleman, who&s;e imagination had been fired by the exploits of heroes, the victories gained by magnanimous pre&s;umption, and the wonders di&s;covered by daring curio&s;ity, was not di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider the acqui&s;ition of wealth as the limit of his ambition, or the repute of hone&s;t indu&s;try as the total of his fame. He regarded his &s;ituation as &s;ervile and ignominious, as the degradation of his ge|nius, and the preclu&s;ion of his hopes; and longing to go in &s;earch of adventures, he neglected his bu&s;ine&s;s as unworthy of his attention, heard the remon&s;trances of his ma&s;ter with a kind of &s;ullen di&s;dain, and after two years legal &s;lavery, made his e&s;cape, and at the next town enli&s;ted him&s;elf a &s;oldier; not doubting but that, by his military merit and the fortune of war, he &s;hould return a general officer, to the confu&s;ion of tho&s;e who would have buried him in the ob&s;curity of a compting-hou&s;e. He found means effectually to elude the en|quiries of his friends, as it was of the utmo&s;t import|ance
<PB N="159" REF="167">to prevent their officious endeavours to ruin his project and ob&s;truct his advancement.</P>
<P>He was &s;ent with other recruits to London, and &s;oon after quartered with the re&s;t of his company in a part of the country, which was &s;o remote from all with whom he had any connection, that he no longer dread|ed a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>It happened that he went one day to the hou&s;e of a neighbouring gentleman with his comrade, who was become acquainted with the chambermaid, and, by her intere&s;t, admitted into the kitchen. This gentleman, who&s;e age was &s;omething more than &s;ixty, had been about two years married to a &s;econd wife, a young woman who had been well educated and lived in the polite world, but had no fortune. By his fir&s;t wife, who had been dead about ten years, he had &s;everal children; the younge&s;t was a daughter who had ju&s;t entered her &s;eventeenth year; &s;he was very tall for her age, had a fine complexion, good features, and was well &s;haped; but her father, who&s;e affection for her was mere in&s;tinct, as much as that of a brute for its young, utterly neglected her education. It was im|po&s;&s;ible for him, he &s;aid, to live without her; and as he could not afford to have her attended by a governe&s;s and proper ma&s;ters in a place &s;o remote from London, &s;he was &s;uffered to continue illiterate and unpoli&s;hed; &s;he knew no entertainment higher than a game at romps with the &s;ervants; &s;he became their confident, and tru&s;ted them in return, nor did &s;he think her&s;elf happy any where but in the kitchen.</P>
<P>As the capricious fondne&s;s of her father had never conciliated her affection, &s;he perceived it abate upon his marriage without regret. She &s;uffered no new re|&s;traint from her new mother, who ob&s;erved with a &s;e|cret &s;atisfaction, that Mi&s;s had been u&s;ed to hide her|&s;elf from vi&s;itors, as neither knowing how to behave nor being &s;it to be &s;een, and cho&s;e rather to conceal her defects by excluding her from company, than to &s;upply them by putting her to a boarding-&s;chool.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168">Mi&s;s, who had been told by Betty that &s;he expected her &s;weetheart, and that they were to be merry, &s;tole down &s;tairs, and, without any &s;cruple, made one in a party at blindman's buff. The &s;oldier of fortune was &s;truck with her per&s;on, and di&s;covered, or thought he di&s;covered, in the &s;implicity of nature, &s;ome graces which are poli&s;hed away by the labour of art. How|ever, nothing that had the appearance of an adventure could be indifferent to him; and his vanity was flat|tered by the hope of carrying off a young lady under the di&s;gui&s;e of a common &s;oldier, without revealing his birth, or boa&s;ting of his expectations.</P>
<P>In this attempt he became very a&s;&s;iduous, and &s;uc|ceeded. The company being ordered to another place, Betty and her young mi&s;tre&s;s departed early in the morning with their gallants; and there being a privi|leged chapel in the next town, they were married.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, as &s;oon as he was informed that his daughter was mi&s;&s;ing, made &s;o diligent and &s;crupu|lous an enquiry after her, that he learned with whom and which way &s;he was gone: he mounted his hor&s;e, and pur&s;ued her, not without cur&s;es and imprecations; di&s;covering rather the tran&s;ports of rage than the emo|tion of tenderne&s;s, and re&s;enting her offence rather as the rebellion of a &s;lave than the di&s;obedience of a child. He did not, however, overtake them till the marriage had been con&s;ummated; of which, when he was in|formed by the hu&s;band, he turned from him with ex|pre&s;&s;ions of brutality and indignation, &s;wearing never to forgive a fault which he had taken no care to prevent.</P>
<P>The young couple, notwith&s;tanding their union fre|quently doubled their di&s;tre&s;s, &s;till continued fond of each other. The &s;pirit of enterprize and the hope of pre&s;umption, were not yet quelled in the young &s;oldier; and he received orders to attend King William, when he went to the &s;iege of Namur, with exultation and tran&s;port, believing his elevation to independence and di&s;tinction as certain as if he had been going to take
<PB N="161" REF="169">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a title and e&s;tate.&mdash;His wife, who had been &s;ome months pregnant, as &s;he had no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence in his ab&s;ence, procured a pa&s;&s;age with him.&mdash;When &s;he came on &s;hore and mingled with the crowd that followed the camp, wretches, who without com|punction, wade in human blood to &s;trip the dying and the dead, to whom horror is become familiar and com|pa&s;&s;ion impo&s;&s;ible, &s;he was terrified: the di&s;cour&s;e of the women, rude and unpoli&s;hed as &s;he was, covered her with confu&s;ion; and the brutal familiarity of the men filled her with indignation and di&s;gu&s;t: her maid, Betty, who had al&s;o attended her hu&s;band, was the only per&s;on with whom &s;he could conver&s;e, and from whom &s;he could hope the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which &s;he was &s;o &s;oon to &s;tand in need.</P>
<P>In the mean time &s;he found it difficult to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but accidentally hearing the name of an officer, whom &s;he remembered to have vi&s;ited her mother &s;oon after her marriage, &s;he applied to him, told him her name, and reque&s;ted that he would afford her his protection, and permit her to take care of his linen. With this reque&s;t the captain complied; her circum&s;tances be|came le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and her mind more ea&s;y: but new calamity &s;uddenly overtook her; &s;he &s;aw her hu&s;|band march to an engagement in the morning, and &s;aw him brought back de&s;perately wounded at night.&mdash;The next day he was removed in a waggon with many others who were in the &s;ame condition, to a place of greater &s;afety, where proper care might be taken of their wounds. She intreated the captain to let her go in the waggon with him; but to this he could not con&s;ent, becau&s;e the waggon would be filled with tho&s;e who neither were able to walk, nor could be left behind. He promi&s;ed, however, that if &s;he would &s;tay till the next day, he would endeavour to procure her a pa&s;&s;age; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he cho&s;e rather to follow the waggon on foot, than to be ab&s;ent from her hu&s;band. She could not, however, keep pace with it, and &s;he reached the ho&s;|pital but ju&s;t time enough to kneel down by him upon
<PB N="162" REF="170">&s;ome clean &s;traw, to &s;ee him &s;ink under the la&s;t agony, and hear the groan that is repeated no more. The fa|tigue of the journey and the perturbation of her mind, immediately threw her into labour, and &s;he lived but to be delivered to MELISSA, who was thus in the mo&s;t helple&s;s &s;tate, left without father, mother, or friend, in a foreign country, in circum&s;tances which could afford no hope of reward to the tenderne&s;s that &s;hould attempt the pre&s;ervation of her life, and among per&s;ons who were become obdurate and in&s;en&s;ible, by having been long u&s;ed to &s;ee every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In happened that, among tho&s;e whom accident or di&s;tre&s;s had brought together at the birth of MELISSA, there was a young woman, who&s;e hu&s;band had fallen in the late engagement, and who a few days before had lo&s;t a little boy that &s;he &s;uckled. This per&s;on, rather perhaps to relieve her&s;elf from an inconveniency, than in compa&s;&s;ion to the orphan, put it to her brea&s;t: but whatever was her motive, &s;he believed that the affording &s;u&s;tenance to the living, conferred a right to the appa|rel of the dead, of which &s;he therefore took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but in &s;earching her pocket &s;he found only a thimble, the remains of a pocket looking-gla&s;s, about the value of a penny in Dutch money, and the certificate of her marriage. The paper, which &s;he could not read, &s;he gave afterwards to the captain, who was touched with pity at the relation which an enquiry after his laundre&s;s produced. He commended the woman who had pre|&s;erved the infant, and put her into the place of its mo|ther. This encouraged her to continue her care of it till the captain returned to England, with whom &s;he al|&s;o returned and became his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>This gentleman, as &s;oon as he had &s;ettled his imme|diate concerns, &s;ent MELISSA, under the care of her nur&s;e, to her grandfather; and inclo&s;ed the certificate of her mother's marriage in a letter containing an ac|count of her death, and the means by which the infant had been pre&s;erved. He knew that tho&s;e who had been once dear to us, by whatever offence they may have
<PB N="163" REF="171">alienated our affection when living, are generally re|membered with tenderne&s;s when dead; and that after the grave has &s;heltered them from our re&s;entment, and rendered reconciliation impo&s;&s;ible, we often regret as &s;evere that conduct which before we approved as ju&s;t; he therefore, hoped, that the parental fondne&s;s which an old man had once felt for his daughter, would re|vive at the &s;ight of her offspring; that the memory of her fault would be lo&s;t in the &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes; and that he would endeavour to atone for that inexo|rable re&s;entment which produced them, by cheri&s;hing a life to which &s;he had, as it were, transferred her own. But in the&s;e expectations, however rea&s;onable, he was mi&s;taken. The old man, when he was inform|ed by the me&s;&s;enger, that the child &s;he held in her arms was his grand-daughter, whom &s;he was come to put under his protection, refu&s;ed to examine the con|tents of the letter, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with menaces and in&s;ult. The knowledge of every uncommon event &s;oon becomes general in a country town. An uncle of MELISSA'S, who had been rejected by his father for having married his maid, heard this fre&s;h in&s;tance of his brutality with grief and indignation; he &s;ent im|mediately for the child and the letter, and a&s;&s;ured the &s;ervant that his niece &s;hould want nothing which he could be&s;tow: to be&s;tow much, indeed, was not in his power, for his father having ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;entment, his whole &s;upport was a little farm which he rented of the '&s;quire: but as he was a good oecono|mi&s;t, and had no children of his own, he lived decent|ly; nor did he throw away content, becau&s;e his father had denied him affluence.</P>
<P>MELISSA, who was compa&s;&s;ionated for her mother's misfortunes, of which her uncle had been particularly informed by her maid Betty, who had returned a wi|dow to her friends in the country, was not le&s;s beloved for her own good qualities; &s;he was taught to read and write, and work at her needle, as &s;oon as &s;he was able to learn; and &s;he was taken notice of by all the
<PB N="164" REF="172">gentry as the prettie&s;t girl in the place: but her aunt died when &s;he was about eleven years old, and before &s;he was thirteen &s;he lo&s;t her uncle.</P>
<P>She was now again thrown back upon the world, &s;till helple&s;s, though her wants were increa&s;ed, and wretched in proportion as &s;he had known happine&s;s: &s;he looked back with angui&s;h, and forward with di&s;|traction; a fit of crying had ju&s;t afforded her a mo|mentary relief, when the '&s;quire, who had been in|formed of the death of his tenant, &s;ent for her to his hou&s;e. This gentleman had heard her &s;tory from her uncle, and was unwilling that a life which had been pre&s;erved alom&s;t by miracle, &s;hould at la&s;t be abandon|ed to mi&s;ery; he therefore determined to receive her into his family, not as a &s;ervant but as a companion to his daughter, a young lady finely accompli&s;hed, and now about fifteen. The old gentleman was touched with her di&s;tre&s;s, and mi&s;s received her with great ten|derne&s;s and complacency: &s;he wiped away her tears, and of the intolerable angui&s;h of her mind, nothing re|mained but a tender remembrance of her uncle, whom &s;he loved and reverenced as a parent. She had now courage to examine the contents of a little box which he had put into her hand ju&s;t before he expired; &s;he found in it only the certificate of her mother's marriage, enclo&s;ed in the captain's letter, and an account of the events that have been before related, which her uncle had put down as they came to his knowledge: the tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of mournful ideas that now ru&s;hed upon her mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed emotions which, if they could not be &s;up|pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> by rea&s;on, were &s;oon de&s;troyed by their own violence.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> MELISSA <HI>continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this family, which in a few weeks after returned to London, MELISSA &s;oon became a favourite: the good '&s;quire &s;eemed to con&s;ider her as his child, and mi&s;s as her &s;i&s;ter; &s;he was taught dancing and mu&s;ic, introduced to the be&s;t company, elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, and allowed &s;uch &s;ums as were nece&s;&s;ary for trivial expen|ces. Youth &s;eldom &s;uffers the dread of to-morrow to intrude upon the enjoyment of to-day, but rather re|gards pre&s;ent felicity as the pledge of future: MELIS|SA was probably as happy as if &s;he had been in the ac|tual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortune, that, to the ea&s;e and &s;plen|dor which &s;he enjoyed already, would have added &s;ta|bility and independence.</P>
<P>She was now in her eighteenth year, and the only &s;on of her benefactor was ju&s;t come from the univer&s;i|ty to &s;pend the winter with his father in town. He was charmed with her per&s;on, behaviour, and di&s;cour&s;e; and what he could not but admire, he took every op|portunity to commend. She &s;oon perceived that he &s;hewed particular marks of re&s;pect to her, when he thought they would not be perceived by others; and that he endeavoured to recommend him&s;elf by an offi|cious a&s;&s;iduity, and a diligent attention to the mo&s;t mi|nute circum&s;tances that might contribute to her plea|&s;ure. But this behaviour of the young gentleman, however it might gratify her vanity, could not fail to alarm her fear: &s;he fore&s;aw, that if what &s;he had re|marked in his conduct &s;hould be perceived by his father or &s;i&s;ter, the peace of the family would be de|&s;troyed; and that &s;he mu&s;t either be &s;hipwrecked in the &s;torm, or thrown overboard to appea&s;e it. She therefore affected not to perceive, that more than a general complai&s;ance was intended by her lover; and hoped that he would thus be di&s;couraged from making an explicit declaration: but though he was mortified at her di&s;regard of that which he knew &s;he could not
<PB N="166" REF="174">but &s;ee, yet he determined to addre&s;s her in &s;uch terms as &s;hould not leave this provoking neutrality in her power: though he reverenced her virtue, yet he feared too much the anger of his father to think of making her his wife; and he was too deeply enamoured of her beauty, to relinqui&s;h his hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her as a mi&s;tre&s;s. An opportunity for the execution of his purpo&s;e was not long wanting: &s;he received his gene|ral profe&s;&s;ions of love with levity and merriment; but when &s;he perceived that his view was to &s;educe her to pro&s;titution, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and fell back in an agony unable to &s;peak. He was immediately touched with grief and remor&s;e; his tenderne&s;s was alarmed at her di&s;tre&s;s, and his e&s;teem encrea&s;ed by her virtue; he catched her in his arms, and as an atonement for the in&s;ult &s;he had received, be offered her marriage: but as her cha&s;tity would not &s;uffer her to become his mi&s;tre&s;s, neither would her gratitude permit her to be|come his wife; and as &s;oon as &s;he was &s;ufficiently re|collected, &s;he intreated him never more to urge her to violate the obligation &s;he was under either to her&s;elf or to her benefactor:&mdash;"Would not," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>the pre&s;ence of a wretch whom you had &s;educed from innocence and peace to remor&s;e and guilt, perpetu|ally upbraid you; and would you not always fear to be betrayed by a wife, who&s;e fidelity no kindne&s;s could &s;ecure; who had broken all the bands that re&s;train the generous and the good; and who by an act of the mo&s;t flagitious ingratitude, had at once reached the pinnacle of guilt, to which others a&s;cend by imperceptible gradations?</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e objections, though they could neither be ob|viated nor evaded, had yet no tendency to &s;ubdue de|&s;ire: he loved with greater delicacy, but with more ar|dour; and as he could not always forbear expo&s;tula|tions, neither could &s;he always &s;ilence them in &s;uch a manner as might mo&s;t effectually prevent their being repeated. Such was one morning the &s;ituation of the two lovers: he had taken her hand into his, and was
<PB N="167" REF="175">&s;peaking with great eagerne&s;s; while &s;he regarded him with a kind of timorous complacency, and li&s;ten|ed to him with an attention which her heart condemn|ed: his father, in this tender moment, in which their powers of perception were mutually engro&s;&s;ed by each other, came near enough to hear that his heir had made propo&s;als of marriage, and retired without their knowledge.</P>
<P>As he did not dream that &s;uch a propo&s;al could po&s;|&s;ibly be rejected by a girl in MELISSA'S &s;ituation, ima|gining that every woman believed her virtue to be in|violate, if her per&s;on was not pro&s;tituted, he took his mea&s;ures accordingly. It was near the time in which his family had been u&s;ed to remove into the country: he, therefore, gave orders, that every thing &s;hould be immediately prepared for the journey, and that the coach &s;hould be ready at &s;ix the next morning, a man and hor&s;e being di&s;patched in the mean time to give notice of their arrival. The young folks were a little &s;urprized at this &s;udden removal; but though the '&s;quire was a good natured man, yet, as he governed his family with high authority, and as they perceived &s;omething had offended him, they did not enquire the rea&s;on, nor indeed did they &s;u&s;pect it. MELISSA packed up her things as u&s;ual: and in the morning the young gentleman and his &s;i&s;ter having by their fa|ther's orders got into the coach, he called MELISSA into the parlour; where in a few words, but with great acrimony, he reproached her with having formed a de&s;ign to marry his &s;on without his con&s;ent, an act of ingratitude, which he &s;aid, ju&s;tified him in upbraid|ing her with the favours which he had already confer|red upon her, and in a re&s;olution he had taken, that a bank, bill of fifty pounds, which he then put into her hand, &s;hould be the la&s;t: adding, that he expected &s;he &s;hould within one week leave the hou&s;e. To this heavy charge &s;he was not in a condition to reply; nor did he &s;tay to &s;ee whether &s;he would attempt it, but
<PB N="168" REF="176">ha&s;tily got into the coach, which immediately drove from the door.</P>
<P>Thus was MELISSA a third time, by a &s;udden and unexpected de&s;ertion, expo&s;ed to penury and di&s;tre&s;s, with this aggravation, that ea&s;e and affluence were be|come habitual; and that though &s;he was not &s;o help|le&s;s as at the death of her uncle, &s;he was expo&s;ed to yet greater danger; for few that have been u&s;ed to &s;lumber upon down, and wake to fe&s;tivity, and re&s;i&s;t the allurements of vice, who &s;till offers ea&s;e and plenty, when the alternative are a flock bed and a garret, &s;hort meals, coar&s;e apparel, and perpetual labour.</P>
<P>MELISSA, as &s;oon as &s;he had recovered from the &s;tupor which had &s;eized her upon &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing and dreadful a change of fortune, determined not to accept the bounty of a per&s;on who imagined her to be un|worthy of it; nor to attempt her ju&s;tification, while it would render her veracity &s;u&s;pected, and appear to pro|ceed only from the hope of being re&s;tored to a &s;tate of &s;plendid dependence, from which jealou&s;y or caprice might again at any time remove her, without cau&s;e and without notice: &s;he had not, indeed, any hope of being ever able to defend her&s;elf again&s;t her accu&s;er upon equal terms; nor did &s;he know how to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a &s;ingle day, when &s;he had returned his bill and quitted his hou&s;e: yet &s;uch was the dignity of her &s;pirit, that &s;he immediately inclo&s;ed it in a blank cover, directed to him at his country &s;eat, and calling up the maid who had been left to take care of the hou&s;e, &s;ent her imme|diately with it to the po&s;t-office. The tears then bur&s;t out, which the agitation of her mind before re|&s;trained; and when the &s;ervant returned, &s;he told her all that had happened, and a&s;ked her advice what &s;he &s;hould do. The girl, after the fir&s;t emotions of won|der and pity had &s;ub&s;ided, told her that &s;he had a &s;i&s;ter who lodged in a reputable hou&s;e, and took in plain-work, to whom &s;he would be welcome, as &s;he could a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her bu&s;ine&s;s, of which &s;he had often more than &s;he could do; and with whom &s;he might conti|nue
<PB N="169" REF="177">till &s;ome more eligible &s;ituation could be obtained. MELISSA li&s;tened to this propo&s;al as to the voice of Heaven; her mind was &s;uddenly relieved from the mo&s;t tormenting perplexity, from the dread of wan|dering about without money or employment, expo&s;ed to the menaces of a beadle, or the in&s;ults of the rabble: &s;he was in ha&s;te to &s;ecure her good fortune, and felt &s;ome degree of pain le&s;t &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e it by the ear|lier application of another; &s;he therefore went imme|diately with the maid to her &s;i&s;ter, with whom it was &s;oon agreed that MELISSA &s;hould work for her board and lodging; for &s;he would not con&s;ent to accept as a gift, that which &s;he could by any means de&s;erve as a payment.</P>
<P>While MELISSA was a journeywoman to a per&s;on, who but a few weeks before would have regarded her with envy, and approached her with confu&s;ion; it hap|pened that a &s;uit of linen was brought from the mili|ner's wrapped up in a new&s;paper: the linen was put into the work-ba&s;ket, and the paper being thrown care|le&s;sly about, MELISSA at la&s;t catched it up, and was about to read it; but perceiving that it had been pub|li&s;hed a fortnight, was ju&s;t going to put it in the fire, when by an accidental glance, &s;he &s;aw her father's name: this immediately engaged her attention, and with great pertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bation of mind &s;he read an adverti&s;e|ment, in which her father, &s;aid to have left his friends about eighteen years before, and to have entered either into the army or the navy, was directed to apply to a per&s;on in Staples-Inn, who could inform him of &s;ome|thing greatly to his advantage. To this per&s;on ME|LISSA applied with all the ardour of curio&s;ity, and all the tumult of expectation: &s;he was informed that the elder brother of the per&s;on mentioned in the adverti&s;e|ment was lately dead, unmarried; that he was po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of fifteen hundred a-year, five hundred of which had de&s;cended to him from his father, and one thou|&s;and had been left him by an uncle, which upon his death, there being no male heir, had been claimed by
<PB N="170" REF="178">his &s;i&s;ters; but that a mi&s;tre&s;s who had lived with him many years, and who had been treated by the &s;uppo&s;ed heire&s;&s;es with too much &s;everity and contempt, had, in the bitterne&s;s of her re&s;entment, publi&s;hed the adver|ti&s;ement, having heard in the family that there was a younger brother abroad.</P>
<P>The conflict of different pa&s;&s;ions that were at once excited with uncommon violence in the brea&s;t of ME|LISSA, deprived her for a time of the power of reflec|tion; and when &s;he became more calm, &s;he knew not by what method to attempt the recovery of her right: her mind was bewildered amid&s;t a thou&s;and po&s;&s;ibili|ties, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the apprehen&s;ion that all might prove ineffectual. After much thought and many projects, &s;he recollected that the captain, who&s;e &s;er|vant brought her to England, could probably afford her more a&s;&s;i&s;tance than any other per&s;on: as he had been often pointed out to her in public places by the '&s;quire, to whom her &s;tory was well known, &s;he was acquainted with his per&s;on, and knew that within a &s;ew months he was alive: &s;he &s;oon obtained directions to his hou&s;e, and being readily admitted to a confer|ence, &s;he told him with as much pre&s;ence of mind as &s;he could, that &s;he was the per&s;on whom his compa&s;|&s;ion had contributed to pre&s;erve when an infant, in confirmation of which &s;he produced his letter, and the certificate which it inclo&s;ed; that by the death of her father's elder brother, who&s;e family &s;he had never known, &s;he was become entitled to a very con&s;iderable e&s;tate; but that &s;he knew not what evidence would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport her claim, how &s;uch evidence was to be produced, nor with whom to intru&s;t the manage|ment of an affair in which wealth and influence would be employed again&s;t her. The old captain received her with that ea&s;y politene&s;s which is almo&s;t peculiar to his profe&s;&s;ion, and with a warmth of benevolence that is &s;eldom found in any: he congratulated her upon &s;o happy and unexpected an event; and without the parade of o&s;tentatious liberality, without extorting
<PB N="171" REF="179">an explicit confe&s;&s;ion of her indigence, he gave her a letter to his lawyer, in whom he &s;aid &s;he might with the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity confide, and with whom &s;he would have nothing more to do than to tell her &s;tory:&mdash; <Q>And do not,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, for I will be ready to te&s;tify what I know of the affair, whenever I &s;hall be called upon; and the woman who was pre&s;ent at your birth, and brought you over, &s;till lives with me, and upon this occa&s;ion may do you &s;ignal &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P>MELISSA departed, melted with gratitude and elated with hope. The gentleman, to whom the captain's letter was a recommendation, pro&s;ecuted her claim with &s;o much &s;kill and a&s;&s;iduity, that within a few months &s;he was put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her e&s;tate.&mdash;Her fir&s;t care was to wait upon the captain, to whom &s;he now owed not only life but a fortune: he received her acknowledgements with a plea&s;ure, which only tho&s;e who merit it can enjoy; and in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould draw upon him for &s;uch &s;ums as &s;he &s;hould want before her rents became due. She then took very hand&s;ome ready-furni&s;hed lodgings, and determin|ed immediately to ju&s;tify her conduct to the '&s;quire, who&s;e kindne&s;s &s;he &s;till remembered, and who&s;e re|&s;entment &s;he had forgiven. With this view &s;he &s;et out in a chariot and &s;ix, attended by two &s;ervants in livery on hor&s;eback, and proceeded to his country-&s;eat, from whence the family was not returned: &s;he had lain at an inn within &s;ix miles of the place, and when the cha|riot drove up to the door, as it was early in the morn|ing, &s;he could perceive the &s;ervants run to and fro in a hurry, and the young lady and her brother gazing through the window to &s;ee if they knew the livery: &s;he remarked every circum&s;tance which denoted her own importance with exultation; and enjoyed the &s;oli|citude which her pre&s;ence produced among tho&s;e, from who&s;e &s;ociety &s;he had &s;o lately been driven with di&s;dain and indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="180">She now increa&s;ed their wonder, by &s;ending in a &s;ervant to acquaint the old gentleman, that a lady de|&s;ired to &s;peak with him about urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, which would not however long detain him: he courteou&s;ly invited the lady to honour him with her commands, ha&s;ted into his be&s;t parlour, adju&s;ted his wig, and put him&s;elf in the be&s;t order to receive her: &s;he alighted, and di&s;played a very rich undre&s;s, which corre&s;ponded with the elegance of her chariot, and the modi&s;h ap|pearance of her &s;ervants. She contrived to hide her face as &s;he went up the walk, that &s;he might not be known to &s;oon; and was immediately introduced to her old friend, to whom &s;he &s;oon di&s;covered her&s;elf to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, and before he had recovered his pre&s;ence of mind, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed him to this effect,&mdash;<Q>You &s;ee, &s;ir, an orphan who is under the greate&s;t obligations to your bounty, but who has been equal|ly injured by your &s;u&s;picions. When I was a de|pendent upon your liberality, I would not a&s;&s;ert my innocence, becau&s;e I could not bear to be &s;u&s;pected of fal&s;ehood: but I a&s;&s;ert it now I am the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a paternal e&s;tate, becau&s;e I cannot bear to be &s;u&s;pect|ed of ingratitude; that your &s;on pre&s;&s;ed me to marry him, is true; but it is al&s;o true that I refu&s;ed him, becau&s;e I would not di&s;appoint your hopes and im|poveri&s;h your po&s;terity.</Q> The old gentleman's con|fu&s;ion was increa&s;ed by the wonders that crowded upon him: he fir&s;t made &s;ome attempts to apologize for his &s;u&s;picions with aukwardne&s;s and he&s;itation; then doubting the truth of appearance, he broke off abrupt|ly and remained &s;ilent; then reproaching him&s;elf, he began to congratulate her upon her good fortune, and again de&s;i&s;ted before he had fini&s;hed the compliment. MELISSA perceived his perplexity and gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e; &s;he was, therefore, about to account more par|ticularly for the &s;udden change of her circum&s;tances, but Mi&s;s, who&s;e maid had brought her intelligence from the &s;ervants, that the lady's name who was with her papa was MELISSA, and that &s;he was lately come to
<PB N="173" REF="181">a great e&s;tate by the death of her uncle, could not longer re&s;train the impatience of her affection and joy: &s;he ru&s;hed into the room and fell upon her neck, with a tran&s;port that can only be felt by friend&s;hip, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed by tears. When this tender &s;ilence was pa&s;t, the &s;cruples of doubt were &s;oon obviated; the recon|ciliation was reciprocal and &s;incere; the father led out his gue&s;t, and pre&s;ented her to his &s;on with an apology for his conduct to them both.</P>

<HEAD>PARENTAL AFFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE white bear of Greenland and Spitzbergen is con&s;iderably larger than the brown bear of Eu|rope, or the black bear of North America. This ani|mal lives upon fi&s;h and &s;eals, and is not only &s;een upon land in the countries bordering upon the North-Pole, but often on floats of ice, &s;everal leagues at &s;ea. The following relation is extracted from the <HI>"Journal of a Voyage, for making Di&s;coveries towards the North-Pole."</HI></P>
<P>Early in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head gave notice that three bears were making their way very fa&s;t over the ice, and that they were directing their cour&s;e towards the &s;hip. They had, without
<PB N="174" REF="182">que&s;tion, been invited by the &s;cent of the blubber of a &s;ea-hor&s;e, killed a few days before, which the men had &s;et on fire, and which was burning on the ice at the time of their approach. They proved to be a &s;he-bear and her two cubs; but the cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to the fire, and drew out from the flames part of the fle&s;h of the &s;ea-hor&s;e, that remained uncon&s;umed, and ate it voraciou&s;ly&mdash;The crew from the &s;hip threw great lumps of the fle&s;h of the &s;ea-hor&s;e, which they had &s;till left, upon the ice, which the old bear fetched away &s;ingly, laid every lump before her cubs as &s;he brought it, and dividing it, gave each a &s;hare, re&s;erving but a &s;mall portion to her&s;elf. As &s;he was fetching away the la&s;t piece, they levelled their mu&s;kets at the cubs, and &s;hot them both dead; and in her retreat they wounded the dam, but not mortally.</P>
<P>It would have drawn tears of pity from any but un|feeling minds, to have marked the affectionate concern expre&s;&s;ed by this poor bea&s;t, in the la&s;t moments of her expiring young. Though &s;he was &s;orely wounded, and could but ju&s;t crawl to the place where they lay, &s;he carried the lump of fle&s;h &s;he had taken away, as &s;he had done others before, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them; and when &s;he &s;aw that they re|fu&s;ed to eat, &s;he laid her paws fir&s;t upon one, and then upon the other, and endeavoured to rai&s;e them up: all this while it was pitiful to hear her moan. When &s;he found &s;he could not &s;tir them, &s;he went off, and when &s;he had gotten at &s;ome di&s;tance, looked back and moaned; and that not availing her to entice them a|way, &s;he returned, and &s;melling round them, began to lick their wounds. She went off a &s;econd time, as be|fore; and having crawled a few paces, looked again behind her, and for &s;ome time &s;tood moaning. But &s;till her cubs not ri&s;ing to follow her, &s;he returned to them again, and with &s;igns of inexpre&s;&s;ible fondne&s;s, went round one, and round the other, pawing them, and moaning. Finding at la&s;t that they were cold and
<PB N="175" REF="183">lifele&s;s, &s;he rai&s;ed her head towards the &s;hip, and growled a cur&s;e upon the murderers; which they re|turned with a volley of mu&s;ket balls. She fell between her cubs, and died, licking their wounds.</P>
<P>Can you admire the maternal affection of the bear, and not feel in your heart the warme&s;t emotions of gratitude, for the &s;tronger and more permanent ten|derne&s;s, you have &s;o long experienced from your pa|rents?</P>

<HEAD><HI>On the</HI> ADVANTAGES <HI>derivable from</HI> NATIONAL ADVERSITY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very certain, that national pro&s;perity, as it is comprehended in the idea of numerous fleets and armies, of exten&s;ive empire, large revenues, advanta|geous commerce, and a profu&s;ion of money in &s;pecie, is a kind of good by no means nece&s;&s;arily connected with moral good, or with the &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s of individuals. It makes a &s;plendid figure in imagina|tion's eye; but to rea&s;on, it appears in a very que&s;tion|able &s;hape, and experience is able to evince, that it has always diffu&s;ed profligacy and mi&s;ery through the walks of private life; and, by introducing luxury, licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, indolence, and corruption, has at once de&s;troyed all that can render human nature dignified and happy, and precipitated the decline and the downfal of em|pires, while triumphing in fancied glory.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the bodies politic and na|tural bear to each other a remarkable analogy. A hu|man form pampered, bloated, and plethoric, will often have the appearance of &s;trength, as well as magnitude; though no &s;tate of it can be le&s;s adapted to facilitate the animal movements, or in greater danger of a ha&s;ty di&s;&s;olution. The body politic al&s;o lo&s;es in mu&s;cular
<PB N="176" REF="184">force, as much as it acquires of unweildy &s;ize, till, by the gradual decrea&s;e of vigour, and augmentation of weight, it totters on its ba&s;ele&s;s &s;upports, and, at la&s;t, lies level with the du&s;t with Babylon and ancient Rome. Luxury, the inevitable con&s;equence of what is fal&s;ely called national pro&s;perity, becomes the grave of em|pires, and of all that could adorn them, or render their long duration a rational object of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>There is, undoubtedly, a certain degree of magni|tude at which when a &s;tate is arrived, it mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity undergo the alternative, of being purged of its pec|cant humours, or falling into a nervele&s;s languor and con&s;equent decline. Perhaps our own country has al|ready arrived at that degree, and is now, under the ope|ration of Divine Providence, &s;uffering the amputation of its morbid excre&s;cences for the &s;alvation of its health and exi&s;tence. It may lo&s;e &s;ome of its revenues; but it will &s;ave and meliorate its morals and its liberty.&mdash;Mini&s;ters may be &s;haken from their &s;eats, pen&s;ioners and placemen may be reduced to de&s;pair, funds may be annihilated, and e&s;tates brought down to their natural value; but freedom, but virtue, but indu&s;try, but the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, but human nature, &s;hall &s;urvive the wreck, and emerge, like &s;ilver and gold when tried by the fire, with new value and additional lu&s;tre. After a &s;tate of political adver&s;ity, &s;omething may take place in the &s;ociety, &s;imilar to the expected renovation of all things, after the general conflagration of the uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty are known to operate in private life as the &s;purs of diligence. Powers, which would for ever have lain dormant in the halcyon days of ea&s;e and plenty, have been called forth by adver&s;ity, and have advanced their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the mo&s;t enviable heights of virtue, happine&s;s, and glory. Man is natu|rally indolent, and when undi&s;turbed, will ba&s;k and &s;leep in the &s;un&s;hine till the &s;leep of death; but, when rou&s;|ed by the bla&s;t and the thunder, he ri&s;es, &s;trains every &s;inew, and marches on to enterprize. Succe&s;s will al|mo&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="185">mo&s;t infallibly attend great exertions uniformly and re|&s;olutely continued; &s;o that what begun in mi&s;ery ends in triumph, as the &s;un which ro&s;e in a mi&s;t de&s;cends with &s;erenity, and paints the whole horizon with gold and purple.</P>
<P>Public indu&s;try may be excited in the &s;ame manner, and in the &s;ame degree, by public misfortunes. The nation is impoveri&s;hed, or, in other words, its &s;uperflui|ties are retrenched. It is an event devoutly to be wi&s;h|ed. Luxury, with ten thou&s;and evils in her train, is obliged to withdraw, and the humble virtues, whom &s;he had driven by her in&s;olence into exile, cheerfully ad|vance from their concealment. Indu&s;try and frugality take the lead; but to what a degree of vigour mu&s;t every mu&s;cle of the body politic be braced, when every member is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, actuated by indu&s;try and frugality. No man ever yet exerted him&s;elf to the ut|mo&s;t of his &s;trength; nor is it on record, that any &s;tate was ever yet &s;o exhau&s;ted, but that while it enjoyed li|berty, it might draw new re&s;ources from its own vitals. Though the tree is lopped, yet, &s;o long as the root re|mains unhurt, it will throw out a greater luxuriancy of branches, produce fruit of better flavour, and derive fre&s;h vigour from the axe. If one has accidentally di&s;turbed an ant-hill, or broken the fabric of the hive, though the little animals appeared before to have exert|ed their utmo&s;t efforts, yet it is amazing, with what additional diligence they apply them&s;elves to repair the depredation. Not a moment is allowed for de&s;ponden|cy. The earth and the air glow with motion, and the misfortune &s;eems immediately to add to their &s;pirits, and, ultimately, both to their &s;tore and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The beautiful de&s;cription which Virgil has given us of the bu&s;y &s;cene in which the Tyrians are engaged in building Carthage, repre&s;ents, in a mo&s;t lively manner, the alacrity with which human creatures are found to exert them&s;elves, when in&s;tigated by the &s;timulus of nece&s;&s;ity. An emulation of labour &s;eizes every bo&s;om. No murmuring, no complainings in the &s;treet, but
<PB N="178" REF="186">every one feels him&s;elf happy, in proportion as he ren|ders him&s;elf u&s;eful. Men's abilities ri&s;e with the oc|ca&s;ion; and political evil, like other evil, under the con|duct of a merciful Deity, has produced exten&s;ive good, by calling forth &s;ome of the noble&s;t exertions, and mo&s;t perfect characters which have adorned the records of human nature.</P>
<P>There is one beneficial effect of national adver&s;ity, of greater importance than any which I have enumerated. It &s;ubdues the haughty &s;oul elevated with riches, and inebriated with exce&s;s, and turns the attention to the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who from his throne beholds all nations, and bids the &s;ceptre to depart from the wicked to the righteous. It teaches us to rely le&s;s upon our German auxiliaries, our mu&s;quets, our mortars, our cannon, our copper-bottomed men of war, our generals, and our admirals, than on the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</P>
<P>When he fights for us we &s;hall conquer. Without him, we &s;hall in vain put our tru&s;t in a Burgoyne, a Keppel, or a Cornwallis; but <Q>the ball empire &s;hall continue to roll on we&s;tward as it has ever yet done, till it &s;tops in America, a world unknown to the an|cients, and which may &s;ave the tears of &s;ome future Alexander.</Q></P>
<P>If Providence &s;hall have decreed the downfal of Bri|ti&s;h &s;upremacy, happy &s;hould I be to have &s;ugge&s;ted one idea which may &s;timulate the exertions of my country|men, once more to rai&s;e the noble column on the ba&s;is of liberty and virtue; or which may con&s;ole them on its ruins; and teach them, while they &s;it by the waters of bitterne&s;s, and hang their harps on the willow, to think of Him who can make rivers of comfort to flow in the dreary de&s;ert.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> IMPUDENCE <HI>and</HI> MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>I Have always been of opinion, that the complaints again&s;t Providence have been ill-grounded, and that the good or bad qualities of men are the cau&s;es of their good or bad fortune, more than what is generaly ima|gined. There are, no doubt, in&s;tances to the contrary, and pretty numerous ones too; but few in compari&s;on of the in&s;tances we have of a right di&s;tribution of pro&s;|perity and adver&s;ity: nor indeed could it be otherwi&s;e from the common cour&s;e of human affairs. To be endowed with a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, and to love others, will almo&s;t infallibly procure love and e&s;teem; which is the chief circum&s;tance in life, and facilitates every enterprize and undertaking; be&s;ides the &s;atisfac|tion, which immediately re&s;ults from it. The ca&s;e is much the &s;ame with the other virtues. Pro&s;perity is naturally, tho' not nece&s;&s;arily, attached to virtue and merit: and adver&s;ity, in like manner, to vice and folly.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, confe&s;s, that this rule admits of an exception with regard to one moral quality; and that Mode&s;ty has a natural tendency to conceal a man's ta|lents, as Impudence di&s;plays them to the utmo&s;t, and has been the only cau&s;e why many have ri&s;en in the world, under all the di&s;advantages of low birth and lit|tle merit. Such indolence and incapacity is there in the generality of mankind, that they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has a mind to put him&s;elf off for; and admit his over-bearing airs as proofs of that merit which he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf. A decent a&s;&s;u|rance &s;eems to be the natural attendant of virtue; and few men can di&s;tingui&s;h impudence from it: as, on the other hand, diffidence, being the natural re&s;ult of vice and folly, has drawn di&s;grace upon mode&s;ty, which in outward appearance &s;o nearly re&s;embles it.</P>
<P>I was lately lamenting to a fiend of mine, that po|pular applau&s;e &s;hould be be&s;towed with &s;o little judg|ment, and that &s;o many empty forward coxcombs
<PB N="180" REF="188">&s;hould ri&s;e up to a figure in the world: upon which he &s;aid there was nothing &s;urpri&s;ing in the ca&s;e. "Popu|lar fame," &s;ay he, "is nothing but breath or air, and air very naturally pre&s;&s;es into a vacuum."</P>
<P>If any thing can give a mode&s;t man more a&s;&s;urance, it mu&s;t be &s;ome advantages of fortune, which chance procures to him. Riches naturally gain a man a fa|vourable reception in the world, and give merit a dou|ble lu&s;tre, when a per&s;on is endowed with it; and &s;up|ply its place, in a great mea&s;ure, when it is ab&s;ent.&mdash;'Tis wonderful to ob&s;erve what airs of &s;uperiority fools and knaves, with large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, give them&s;elves a|bove men of the greate&s;t merit in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make any &s;trong oppo&s;ition to the&s;e u&s;urpations; or rather &s;eem to favour them by the mode&s;ty of their behaviour. Their good &s;en&s;e and ex|perience make them diffident of their judgment, and cau&s;e them to examine every thing with the greate&s;t accuracy: as, on the other hand, the delicacy of their &s;entiments makes them timorous le&s;t they commit faults, and lo&s;e in the practice of the world, that integ|rity of virtue, of which they are &s;o jealous. To make wi&s;dom agree with confidence, is as difficult as to re|concile vice to mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the reflections that have occurred to me upon this &s;ubject of Impudence and Mode&s;ty; and I hope the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee them wrought into the following allegory:</P>
<P>JUPITER, in the beginning, joined VIRTUE, WIS|DOM, and CONFIDENCE together; and VICE, FOL|LY, and DIFFIDENCE: and in that &s;ociety &s;et them upon the earth. But though he thought he had match|ed them with great judgment, and &s;aid, that Confi|dence was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice de&s;erved to be attended with Diffidence; they had not gone far before di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e among them. Wi&s;dom, who was the guide of the one company, was always accu&s;tomed, before &s;he ventured upon any road, however beaten, to examine it carefully; to enquire
<PB N="181" REF="189">whither it led; what dangers, difficulties, and hindran|ces, might po&s;&s;ibly or probably occur in it. In the&s;e deliberations &s;he u&s;ually con&s;umed &s;ome time; which delay was very di&s;plea&s;ing to Confidence, who was al|ways inclined to hurry on, without much fore-thought or deliberation, in the fir&s;t road he met. Wi&s;dom and Virtue were in&s;eparable: but Confidence one day, following his impetuous nature, advanced a con&s;idera|ble way before his guides and companions; and not feeling any want of their company, he never enquired after them, nor ever met with them more. In like manner, the other &s;ociety, tho' joined by Jupiter, di&s;|agreed and &s;eparated. As Folly &s;aw very little way before her, &s;he had nothing to determine concerning the goodne&s;s of roads, nor could give the preference to one above another; and this want of re&s;olution was encrea&s;ed by Diffidence, who, with her doubts and &s;cruples, always retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays, and was never &s;atisfied without his full career, in whatever his inclination led him to. Folly, he knew, tho' &s;he hearkened to Diffidence, would be ea&s;ily managed when alone; and therefore, as a vicious hor&s;e throws his rider, he openly beat away this controller of all his plea&s;ures, and proceeded in his journey with Folly, from whom he is in&s;epara|ble. Confidence and Diffidence being, after this manner, both thrown loo&s;e from their re&s;pective com|panies, wandered for &s;ome time; till at la&s;t chance led them at the &s;ame time to one village. Confidence went directly up to the great hou&s;e, which belonged to WEALTH, the lord of the village; and without &s;tay|ing for a porter, intruded him&s;elf immediately into the innermo&s;t apartments, where he found Vice and Folly well received before him. He joined the train; recom|mended him&s;elf very quickly to his landlord; and entered into &s;uch familiarity with Vice, that he was en|li&s;ted in the &s;ame company along with Folly. They were frequent gue&s;ts of Wealth, and from that mo|ment
<PB N="182" REF="190">in&s;eparable. Diffidence, in the mean time, not daring to approach the great hou&s;e, accepted of an in|vitation from POVERTY, one of the tenants; and enter|ing the cottage, found Wi&s;dom and Virtue, who being repul&s;ed by the landlord, had retired thither. Virtue took compa&s;&s;ion of her, and Wi&s;dom found, from her temper, that &s;he would ea&s;ily improve: &s;o they admited her into their &s;ociety. Accordingly, by their means, &s;he altered in a little time &s;omewhat of her manner, and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now called by the name of MODESTY. As ill company has a greater effect than good, Confidence, tho' more refractory to coun&s;el and example, degenerated &s;o far by the &s;ociety of Vice and Folly, as to pa&s;s by the name of IMPUDENCE. Mankind, who &s;aw the&s;e &s;ocieties as Jupiter fir&s;t joined them, and knowing nothing of the&s;e mutual de&s;ertions, are led into &s;trange mi&s;takes by tho&s;e means; and wherever they &s;ee Impudence, make ac|count of Virtue and Wi&s;dom; and wherever they ob|&s;erve Mode&s;ty, call her attendants Vice and Folly:</P>

<PB N="183" REF="191">the exhibition of a farce or puppet-&s;how. But, not|with&s;tanding the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of all the&s;e &s;olemnities, we, alas! are doomed to feel that they are no farce, but the concomitant circum&s;tances of a mo&s;t woeful tragedy.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of war are for the mo&s;t part &s;uch as mu&s;t di&s;grace an animal pretending to rationality. Two poor mortals, elevated with the di&s;tinction of a golden bauble on their heads, called a crown, take offence at each other, without any rea&s;on, or with the very bad one of wi&s;hing for an opportunity of aggrandizing them&s;elves, by making reciprocal depredations. The creatures of the court, and the leading men of the na|tion, who are u&s;ually under the influence of the court, re&s;olve (for it is their intere&s;t) to &s;upport their royal ma&s;ter, and are never at a lo&s;s to invent &s;ome coloura|ble pretence for engaging the nation in the horrors of war. Taxes of the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome kind are levied, &s;oldiers are collected &s;o as to leave a paucity of hu&s;|bandmen, reviews and encampments &s;ucceed, and at la&s;t fifteen or twenty thou&s;and men meet on a plain, and coolly &s;hed each other's blood, without the &s;malle&s;t per&s;onal animo&s;ity, or the &s;hadow of a provocation.&mdash;The kings, in the mean time, and the grandees, who have employed the&s;e poor innocent victims to &s;hoot bullets at each other's heads, remain quietly at home, and amu&s;e them&s;elves, in the intervals of balls, hunting &s;chemes, and plea&s;ures of every &s;pecies, with reading at the fire&s;ide, over a cup of chocolate, the di&s;patches from the army, and the news in the Extraordinary Gazette. Old Horace very truly ob&s;erves, that what|ever mad frolics enter into the heads of kings, it is the common people, that is, the hone&s;t arti&s;an, and the in|du&s;trious tribes in the middle ranks, <HI>unoffended</HI> and <HI>un|offending,</HI> who chiefly &s;uffer in the evil con&s;equences. If the king of Pru&s;&s;ia were not at the head of &s;ome of the be&s;t troops in the univer&s;e, he would be judged more worthy of being tried, ca&s;t, and condemned at the Old Bailey, than any &s;hedder of blood who ever
<PB N="184" REF="192">died by a halter. But he is a king; but he is a hero;&mdash;tho&s;e names fa&s;cinate us, and we enrol the butcher of mankind among their benefactors.</P>
<P>When one con&s;iders the dreadful circum&s;tances that attend even victories, one cannot help being a little &s;hocked at the exultation which they occa&s;ion. I have often thought it a laughable &s;cene, if there were not a little too much of the melancholy in it, when a circle of eager politicians have met to congratulate each other on what is called a piece of good news ju&s;t arrived.&mdash;Every eye &s;parkles with delight; every voice is rai&s;ed in announcing the happy event. And what is the cau&s;e of all this joy? and for what are our windows illuminated, bonfires kindled, bells rung, and fea&s;ts celebrated? We have had a &s;ucce&s;sful engagement. We have left a thou&s;and of the enemy dead on the field of battle, and only nine hundred of our countrymen. Charming news! it was a glorious battle! But before you give a loo&s;e to your raptures, pau&s;e a while; and con&s;ider, that to every one of the&s;e nineteen hundred, life was no le&s;s &s;weet than it is to you; that to the far greater part of them there probably were wives, fathers, mothers, &s;ons, daughters, &s;i&s;ters, brothers, and friends, all of whom are at this moment bewailing the event which occa&s;ions your fooli&s;h and brutal triumph.</P>
<P>The whole time of war ought to be a time of general mourning, a mourning in the heart, a mourning much more &s;incere than on the death of one of tho&s;e princes who&s;e cur&s;ed ambition is often the &s;ole cau&s;e of war. Indeed that a whole people &s;hould tamely &s;ubmit to the evils of war, becau&s;e it is the will of a few vain, &s;elfi&s;h, ignorant, though exalted, individuals, is a phenomenon almo&s;t unaccountable. But they are led away by fal&s;e glory, by their pa&s;&s;ions, by their vices. They reflect not; and indeed, if they did reflect, and oppo&s;e, what would avail the oppo&s;ition of unarmed myriads to the mandate of a government &s;upported by a &s;tanding army? Many of the European nations are entirely military;
<PB N="185" REF="193">war is their trade; and when they have no employment at home, or near it, they blu&s;h not to let them&s;elves out to &s;hed any blood, in any cau&s;e of the be&s;t payma&s;ter. Ye bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, no longer allow that man is your &s;uperior, while there is found on the face of the earth &s;uch degeneracy!</P>
<P>Morality and religion forbid war in its motives, con|duct, and con&s;equences; but to many rulers and po|tentates, morality and religion appear as the inventions of politicians to facilitate &s;ubordination. The princi|pal objects of crowned heads, and their minions, are the exten&s;ion of empire, the augmentation of a revenue, or the annihilation of their &s;ubjects' liberty. Their re|&s;traints in the pur&s;uit of the&s;e objects are not tho&s;e of morality and religion; but &s;olely rea&s;ons of &s;tate, and political caution. Plau&s;ible words are u&s;ed, but they are only u&s;ed to hide the deformity of the real princi|ples. Wherever war is deemed de&s;irable in an inte|re&s;ted view, a &s;pecious pretext never yet remained un|found. Morality is as little con&s;idered in the begin|ning, as in the pro&s;ecution of war. The mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties and engagements are violated by the governing part of the nation, with no more &s;cruple than oaths and bonds are broken by a cheat and a villain in the walks of private life. Does the difference of rank and &s;itua|tion make any difference in the atrocity of crimes? If any, it renders a thou&s;and times more criminal than that of a thief, the villany of them, who, by violating every &s;acred obligation between nation and nation, give ri&s;e to mi&s;eries and mi&s;chiefs mo&s;t dreadful in their nature; and to which no human power can &s;ay, Thus far &s;hall ye proceed, and no farther. Are not the na|tural and moral evils of life &s;ufficient, but they mu&s;t be rendered more acute, more numerous, and more embit|tered by artificial means? My heart bleeds over tho&s;e complicated &s;cenes of woe, for which no epithet can be found &s;ufficiently de&s;criptive. Language fails in labouring to expre&s;s the horrors of war amid private
<PB N="186" REF="194">families who are &s;o unfortunate as to be &s;ituated on the &s;eat of it.</P>
<P>War, however, it will be &s;aid, has always been per|mitted by Providence. This is indeed true; but it has been only permitted as a &s;courge. Let a &s;pirit and activity be exerted in regulating the morals of a nation, equal to that with which war, and all its apparatus, are attended to, and mankind will no longer be &s;courged, neither will it be nece&s;&s;ary to evacuate an empire of its members, for none will be &s;uperfluous. Let us, ac|cording to the advice of a pious divine of the pre&s;ent age, think le&s;s of our fleets and armies, and more of our faith and practice. While we are warriors, with all our preten&s;ions to civilization, we are &s;avages.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On the</HI> IMPORTANCE <HI>of</HI> GOVERNING <HI>the</HI> TEMPER.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the many complaints of the calamities of human life, it is certain, that more con&s;tant unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es from ill temper than from ill fortune. In vain has providence be&s;towed every external ble&s;&s;ing, if care has not been taken by our&s;elves to &s;mooth the a&s;perities of the temper. A bad temper embitters every &s;weet, and converts a para|di&s;e into a place of torment.</P>
<P>The government of the temper then, on which the happine&s;s of the human race &s;o greatly depends, can never be too frequently or too forcibly recommended. But as it was found by &s;ome of the ancients one of the mo&s;t efficacious methods of deterring young per&s;ons from any di&s;agreeable or vicious conduct, to point out a living character in which it appeared in all its de|formity, I &s;hall exhibit a picture, in which I hope a bad temper will appear, as it really is, a mo&s;t unamiable object.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="195">It is by no means uncommon to ob&s;erve tho&s;e, who have been flattered for &s;uperficial qualities at a very early age, and engaged in &s;o con&s;tant a &s;eries of di&s;&s;i|pating plea&s;ure, as to leave no time for the culture of the mind, becoming, in the middle and advanced peri|ods of life, melancholy in&s;tances of the mi&s;erable ef|fects re&s;ulting from an ungoverned temper. A certain lady, whom I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of Hi&s;pulla, was celebrated from her infancy for a fine complexion. She had, indeed, no very amiable expre&s;&s;ion in her eyes, but the vermilion of her cheeks did not fail to attract admiration, and &s;he was convinced by her gla&s;s, and by the a&s;&s;everations of the young men, that &s;he was another and a fairer Helen. She had every op|portunity of improving her mind; but as we naturally be&s;tow our fir&s;t care on the quality which we mo&s;t va|lue, &s;he could never give her attention either to books or to oral in&s;truction, and at the age of fifteen or &s;ix|teen could &s;carcely write her name legibly, or read a &s;entence without he&s;itation. Her per&s;onal charms were, however, powerful enough to captivate the heart of a thoughtle&s;s heir, very little older than her&s;elf.&mdash;Her vanity, rather than her love, was gratified by the alliance; and when &s;he found the a&s;&s;iduities of promi&s;|cuous &s;uitors at an end, &s;he found her&s;elf gradually &s;inking in the dead calm of in&s;ipidity. When love was no more, other pa&s;&s;ions &s;prung up with all the luxuriancy of rank weeds, in a &s;oil where no &s;alutary herb had been planted in the vernal &s;ea&s;on&punc; Pride, that fruitful plant, which bears every kind of odious quality in abundance, took root in her heart, and flouri&s;hed like the nettle or the hemlock on the banks of the &s;tag|nant pool.</P>
<P>Her hu&s;band was the fir&s;t to feel its baneful effects. Though the match was greatly to her advantage, &s;he per&s;uaded her&s;elf that &s;he might have done better; and that her good fortune was by no means adequate to the prize which her beauty and merit might have ju&s;tly claimed. With this conviction, and without any habits
<PB N="188" REF="196">or abilities which might lead her to &s;eek amu&s;ement in books, &s;he found no diver&s;ion &s;o congenial to her heart, as the tormenting a good-natured, young, and agreea|ble hu&s;band, who, by marrying, had excluded her from the probability of a title. As a &s;mall compen&s;ation for the injury received, &s;he a&s;&s;umed an ab&s;olute dominion over him, his fortune, and his family. He dur&s;t not differ in opinion from her; for on the &s;lighte&s;t oppo|&s;ition, her eyes dart fire, her cheeks glow with indig|nation, and her tongue utters every bitter word which rage and malice can dictate. The comfort of every meal is poi&s;oned by a quarrel; and an angry vocifera|tion is re-echoed from the parlour to the kitchen, from the cellar to the garret, by night and by day, except in the awful and ominous pau&s;e of a &s;ullen &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>The poor hu&s;band, who, with every amiable di&s;po&s;i|tion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o the virtue of patience, bore the evil as long as human nature could bear it; but as years advanced, and her fury increa&s;ed, he &s;ought a refuge at the tavern, and in the compo&s;ing juice of the grape.&mdash;Exce&s;s and vexation &s;oon laid him in the only &s;ecure a&s;ylum from the &s;tings and arrows of an outrageous temper, the &s;ilent tomb.</P>
<P>The children, after &s;uffering every &s;pecies of per&s;e|cution which an angry, though fooli&s;hly fond mother could inflict, no &s;ooner arrived at maturity, than they began to look for happine&s;s in an e&s;cape from home, where neither peace nor ea&s;e could find a place. The daughters married meanly, unworthily, and wretched|ly, contented to take refuge from the rage of a furious mother in the arms of footmen and hair-dre&s;&s;ers; the &s;ons ran away, and became vagrant and wretched de|bauchees; till, in mere de&s;pair, one of them entered as a &s;oldier in the Ea&s;t-India &s;ervice, and the other put an end to his own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The mother, after &s;hedding a few natural tears, and wiping them &s;oon, began to feel her pride and pa&s;&s;ion amply gratified in an ab&s;olute dominion over an e&s;tate,
<PB N="189" REF="197">a man&s;ion-hou&s;e, and a tribe of &s;ervants, who&s;e de|pendent &s;ituation made them bear her fury with little re&s;i&s;tance. But &s;he enjoyed her reign but a &s;hort time; for as her mind was incapable of re&s;ting on it&s;elf for &s;upport, &s;he &s;ought relief from the bottle of cordial; and, heated one day with a large draught, and a violent pa&s;&s;ion with one of the maids, &s;he bur&s;t a blood-ve&s;&s;el, and expired in a &s;colding fit, her tongue &s;till quivering after her heart had cea&s;ed its pul&s;ation.</P>
<P>I believe the originals of &s;uch a picture as this, are much le&s;s common in the pre&s;ent age, than they were in the la&s;t century. Ladies were then &s;ecluded from the world till marriage, and as they were very &s;uperfi|cially educated in every thing but potting and pre&s;erv|ing, it is no wonder if they became termagants, &s;hrews, or viragos. They had no right ideas of them&s;elves or the world around them, and yielded, without oppo&s;ition, to tho&s;e violent emotions, which ari&s;e perhaps in every mind when it is totally uncultivated.</P>
<P>Culture of the under&s;tanding is, indeed, one of the be&s;t methods of &s;ubduing the heart to &s;oftne&s;s, and re|deeming it from that &s;avage &s;tate in which it too often comes from the hands of nature. The more our rea&s;on is &s;trengthened, the better &s;he is enabled to keep her &s;eat on the throne, and to govern tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which were appointed to be her &s;ubjects; but which too often rebel, and &s;ucceed in their unnatural revolt. But be|&s;ides the effect of mental culture, in calling forth and increa&s;ing the powers of the rea&s;oning faculty, it &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s an influence in humanizing the feelings, and meliorating the native di&s;po&s;ition. Mu&s;ic, painting, and poetry, teach the mind to &s;elect the agreeable parts of tho&s;e objects which &s;urround us, and by habituating it to a pure and permanent delight, gradually &s;uperin|duce an habitual good-homour. It is of infinite im|portance to happine&s;s, that the mind &s;hould be ac|cu&s;tomed from infancy to turn from deformed and pain|ful &s;cenes, and to contemplate whatever can be found of moral and natural beauty. The &s;pirits, under this
<PB N="190" REF="198">benign management, contract a milkine&s;s, and learn to flow all cheerily in their &s;mooth and yielding channels; while, on the contrary, if the young mind is tea&s;ed, fretted, and neglected, the pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;pirits be|come rugged, abrupt, exa&s;perated, and the whole ner|vous &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to acquire an exce&s;&s;ive irritability. The ill treatment of children has not only made them wretched at the time, but wretched for life; tearing the fine contexture of their nerves, and roughening, by example, and by &s;ome &s;ecret and internal influence, the very con&s;titution of their tempers.</P>
<P>So much of the happine&s;s of private life, and the virtues of mothers and daughters in particular, depends on the government of the temper, that the temper ought to be a principal object of regard in a well-con|ducted education. The &s;uffering of children to tyran|ni&s;e, without controul, over &s;ervants and inferiors, is, I am convinced, the ruin of many an amiable di&s;po&s;ition. The virtues of humanity, benevolence, humility, can|not be too early enforced; at the &s;ame time care &s;hould be taken that an infant of two or three years old &s;hould never be beaten or &s;poken to har&s;hly for any offence which it can po&s;&s;ibly commit. In &s;hort, let every method be u&s;ed which rea&s;on, religion, prudence, and experience, can &s;ugge&s;t, to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e of &s;weetening the temper, and bani&s;hing the furies from &s;ociety. May the endeavour be &s;ucce&s;sful; and may we only read, that there have indeed been &s;uch animals as &s;hrews and viragos, but that the breed is extinct in England, like the breed of wolves!</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> DISTRESSES <HI>of a</HI> MODEST MAN.</HEAD>
<P>MY father was a farmer of no great property, and with no other learning than what he had acquired at a charity-&s;chool; but my mother being dead, and I an only child, he determined to give me that advantage, which he fancied would have made him happy, viz. a learned education.&mdash;I was &s;ent to a country grammar-&s;chool, and from thence to the Uni|ver&s;ity, with a view of qualifying for holy orders. Here, having but &s;mall allowance from my father, and being naturally of a timid and ba&s;hful di&s;po&s;ition, I had no opportunity of rubbing off that native awkward|ne&s;s, which is the fatal cau&s;e of all my unhappine&s;s, and which I now begin to fear can never be amended. You mu&s;t know, that in my per&s;on I am tall and thin, with a fair complexion, and light flaxen hair; but of &s;uch extreme &s;u&s;ceptibility of &s;hame, that on the &s;mal|le&s;t &s;ubject of confu&s;ion, by blood all ru&s;hes into my cheeks, and I appear a full-blown ro&s;e. The con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of this unhappy failing made me avoid &s;ociety, and I became enamoured of a college life; particularly when I reflected, that the uncouth manners of my father's family were little calculated to improve my outward conduct; I therefore had re&s;olved on living at the Univer&s;ity and taking pupils, when two unex|pected events greatly altered the po&s;ture of my affairs, viz. my father's death, and the arrival of an uncle from the Indies.</P>
<P>This uncle I had very rarely heard my father men|tion, and it was generally believed that he was long &s;ince dead, when he arrived in England only a week too late to clo&s;e his brother's eyes. I am a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, what I believe has been often experienced by tho&s;e who&s;e education has been better than their pa|rents, that my poor father's ignorance and vulgar lan|guage had often made me blu&s;h to think I was his &s;on; and at his death I was not incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of<PB N="192" REF="200"><HI>that,</HI> which I was not unfrequently a&s;hamed to own. My uncle was but little affected, for he had been &s;epa|rated from his brother more than thirty years, and in that time had acquired a fortune which, he u&s;ed to brag, would make a Nabob happy; in &s;hort, he had brought over with him the enormous &s;um of thirty thou&s;and pounds, and upon this he built his hopes of never-ending happine&s;s. While he was planning &s;chemes of greatne&s;s and delight, whether the change of climate might affect him, or what other cau&s;e I know not, but he was &s;natched from all his dreams of joy by a &s;hort illne&s;s, of which he died, leaving me heir to all his property. And now, Sir, behold me at the age of twenty-five, well &s;tocked with Latin, Greek, and Mathematics, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample fortune, but &s;o awkward and unver&s;ed in every gentleman-like ac|compli&s;hment, that I am pointed at by all who &s;ee me, as the <HI>wealthy learned fool.</HI></P>
<P>I have lately purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in the country, which abounds in (what is called) a fa&s;hionable neigh|bourhood; and when you reflect on my parentage and uncouth manner, you will hardly think how much my company is courted by the &s;urrounding families, (e&s;pe|cially by tho&s;e who have marriageable daughters): From the&s;e gentlemen I have received familiar calls, and the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invitations, and though I wi&s;hed to accept their offered friend&s;hip, I have repeatedly ex|cu&s;ed my&s;elf under the pretence of not being quite &s;ettled; for the truth is, that when I have rode or walked, with full intention to return their &s;everal vi|&s;its, my heart has failed me as I approached their gates, and I have frequently returned homeward, re&s;olving to try again to-morrow.</P>
<P>However, I at length determined to conquer my ti|midity, and, three days ago, accepted of an invitation to dine this day with one, who&s;e open ea&s;y manner left me no room to doubt a cordial welcome. Sir THO|MAS FRIENDLY, who lives about two miles di&s;tant, is a baronet, with about two thou&s;and pounds a year
<PB N="193" REF="201">e&s;tate, joining to that I purcha&s;ed; he has two &s;ons and five daughters, all grown up, and living with their mother and a maiden &s;i&s;ter of Sir THOMAS'S at <HI>Friend|ly-Hall,</HI> dependant on their father. Con&s;cious of my unpoli&s;hed gait, I have, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, taken pri|vate le&s;&s;ons of a <HI>Profe&s;&s;or,</HI> who teaches "grown gen|tlemen to dance;" and though I at fir&s;t found wonder|ous difficulty in the art he taught, my knowledge of the mathematics was of prodigious u&s;e in teaching me the equilibrium of my body, and the due adju&s;tment of the centre of gravity to the five po&s;itions. Having now acquired the art of walking without tottering, and learned to make a bow, I boldly ventured to obey the baronet's invitation to a family dinner; not doubt|ing but my new acquirements would enable me to &s;ee the ladies with tolerable intrepidity: but alas! how vain are all the hopes of <HI>theory</HI> when un&s;upported by habitual <HI>practice&punc;</HI> As I approached the hou&s;e, a dinner-bell alarmed my fears, le&s;t I had &s;poiled the dinner by want of punctuality; impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, I blu&s;h|ed the deepe&s;t crim&s;on, as my name was repeatedly announced by the &s;everal livery &s;ervants, who u&s;hered me into the library, hardly knowing what or whom I &s;aw; at my fir&s;t entrance I &s;ummoned all my forti|tude, and made my new-learned bow to Lady FRIENDLY, but unfortunately, in bringing back my left foot to the third po&s;ition, I trod upon the gouty toe of poor Sir THOMAS, who had followed clo&s;e at my heels to be the Nomenclator of the family. The confu&s;ion this occa&s;ioned in <HI>me</HI> is hardly to be conceiv|ed, &s;ince none but ba&s;hful men <HI>can</HI> judge of my di&s;tre&s;s, and of that de&s;cription the number I believe is very &s;mall. The Baronet's politene&s;s by degrees di&s;&s;ipated my concern; and I was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee how far good breeding could enable him to &s;uppre&s;s his feelings, and to appear with perfect ea&s;e after &s;o painful an ac|cident.</P>
<P>The cheerfulne&s;s of her Lady&s;hip, and the familiar chat of the young ladies, in&s;en&s;ibly led me to throw off
<PB N="194" REF="202">my re&s;erve and &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s, till at length I ventured to join in conver&s;ation, and even to &s;tart fre&s;h &s;ubjects. The library being richly furni&s;hed with books in ele|gant bindings, I conceived Sir THOMAS to be a man of literature, and ventured to give my opinion concern|ing the &s;everal editions of the Greek cla&s;&s;ics, in which the Baronet's opinion exactly coincided with my own. To this &s;ubject I was led by ob&s;erving an edition of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in &s;ixteen volumes, which (as I had never before heard of &s;uch a thing) greatly excited my curio|&s;ity, and I ro&s;e up to examine what it could be: Sir THOMAS &s;aw what I was about, and, (as I &s;uppo&s;e) willing to &s;ave me the trouble, ro&s;e to take down the book, which made me more eager to prevent him, and, ha&s;tily laying my hand on the fir&s;t volume, I pulled it forcibly; but lo! in&s;tead of books, a board, which by leather and gilding had been made to look like &s;ixteen volumes, came tumbling down, and unluckily pitched upon a Wedgewood ink-&s;tand on the table under it.&mdash;In vain did Sir THOMAS a&s;&s;ure me there was no harm; I &s;aw the ink &s;treaming from an inlaid table on the Turkey carpet, and, &s;carce knowing what I did, at|tempted to &s;top its progre&s;s with my cambric handker|chief. In the height of this confu&s;ion we were in|formed that dinner was &s;erved up, and I with joy per|ceived, that the bell which at fir&s;t had &s;o alarmed my fears, was only the half-hour dinner-bell.</P>
<P>In walking through the hall and &s;uite of apartments to the dining-room, I had time to collect my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es, and was de&s;ired to take my &s;eat betwixt Lady FRIENDLY and her elde&s;t daughter at the table.&mdash;Since the fall of the wooden <HI>Xenophon</HI> my face had been continually burning like a fire-brand, and I was ju&s;t beginning to recover my&s;elf, and to feel comforta|bly cool, when an unlooked-for accident rekindled all my heat and blu&s;hes. Having &s;et my plate of &s;oup too near the edge of the table, in bowing to Mi&s;s DINAH, who politely complimented the pattern of my wai&s;t|coat, I tumbled the whole &s;calding contents into my
<PB N="195" REF="203">lap. In &s;pite of an immediate &s;upply of napkins to wipe the &s;urface of my cloaths, my black &s;ilk breeches were not &s;tout enough to &s;ave me from the painful ef|fects of this &s;udden fomentation, and for &s;ome minutes my legs and thighs &s;eemed &s;tewing in a boiling caul|dron; but recollecting how Sir THOMAS had di&s;gui&s;ed his torture when I trod upon his toe, I firmly bore my pain in &s;ilence, and &s;at with my lower extremities par|boiled, amid&s;t the &s;tifled giggling of the ladies and the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>I will not relate the &s;everal blunders which I made during the fir&s;t cour&s;e, or the di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by my being de&s;ired to carve a fowl, or help to various di&s;hes that &s;tood near me, &s;pilling a &s;auce-boat, and knocking down a &s;alt-&s;eller; rather let me ha&s;ten to the &s;econd cour&s;e, "where fre&s;h di&s;a&s;ters overwhelmed me quite."</P>
<P>I had a piece of rich &s;weet pudding on my fork, when Mi&s;s LOUISA FRIENDLY begged to trouble me for a pigeon that &s;tood near me; in my ha&s;te, &s;carce knowing what I did, I whipped the pudding into my mouth, hot as a burning coal; it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal my agony, my eyes were &s;tarting from their &s;ockets. At la&s;t, in &s;pite of &s;hame and re&s;olution, I was obliged to drop the cau&s;e of torment on my plate. Sir THOMAS and the Ladies all compa&s;&s;ionated my misfortune, and each advi&s;ed a different application; one recommended oil, another water, but all agreed that wine was be&s;t for drawing out the fire; and a gla&s;s of &s;herry was brought me from the &s;ide-board, which I &s;natched up with eagerne&s;s: but oh! how &s;hall I tell the &s;equel? whether the butler by accident mi&s;|took, or purpo&s;ely de&s;igned to drive me mad, he gave me the &s;tronge&s;t brandy, with which I filled my mouth, already flea'd and bli&s;tered; totally unu&s;ed to every kind of ardent &s;pirits, with my tongue, throat, and palate, as raw as beef, what could I do? I could not &s;wallow, and clapping my hands upon my mouth, the cur&s;ed liquor &s;quirted through my no&s;e and fingers
<PB N="196" REF="204">like a fountain over all the di&s;hes, and I was cru&s;hed by bur&s;ts of laughter from all quarters. In vain did Sir THOMAS reprimand the &s;ervants, and Lady FRIEND|LY chide her daughters; for the mea&s;ure of my &s;hame and their diver&s;ion was not yet compleat. To relieve me from the intolerable &s;tate of per&s;piration which this accident had cau&s;ed, without con&s;idering what I did, I wiped my face with that ill-fated handkerchief, which was &s;till wet from the con&s;equences of the fall of <HI>Xe|nophon,</HI> and covered all my features with &s;treaks of ink in every direction. The Baronet him&s;elf could not &s;upport this &s;hock, but joined his Lady in the general laugh; while I &s;prung from the table in de&s;pair, ru&s;h|ed out of the hou&s;e, and ran home in an agony of con|fu&s;ion and di&s;grace, which the mo&s;t poignant &s;en&s;e of guilt could not have excited.</P>
<P>Thus, without having deviated from the path of mo|ral rectitude, I am &s;uffering torments like a "goblin damn'd." The lower half of me has been almo&s;t boil|ed, my tongue and mouth grilled, and I bear the mark of CAIN upon my forehead; yet the&s;e are but trifling con&s;iderations to the everla&s;ting &s;hame which I mu&s;t feel whenever this adventure &s;hall be mentioned.</P>

<P>ISRAEL loved Jo&s;eph more than all his children, becau&s;e he was the &s;on of his old age; and he gave him a coat of many colours. But when his brethren &s;aw their father's partiality to him, they hated him, and would not &s;peak peaceably unto him. And Jo|&s;eph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren. Behold, he &s;aid, we were binding &s;heaves in the field; and lo! my &s;heaf aro&s;e and &s;tood upright; and your &s;heaves &s;tood round about, and made obei&s;ance to my
<PB N="197" REF="205">&s;heaf. And his brethren &s;aid unto him, Shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him the more for his dreams, and for his words.</P>
<P>It happened that his brethren went to feed their fa|ther's flock in Dothan. And Jo&s;eph went after his brethren; but, when they &s;aw him afar off, they con|&s;pired again&s;t him to &s;lay him; and they &s;aid one to another, We will tell our father that &s;ome evil bea&s;t hath devoured him. But Reuben wi&s;hed to deliver him out of their hands; and he &s;aid, Let us not kill him, but ca&s;t him into this pit, that is in the wilderne&s;s: And they followed his coun&s;el, and ca&s;t him into a pit, which then contained no water. A company of I&s;h|maelites from Gilead pa&s;&s;ed by, at this time, with their camels, bearing &s;picery, balm, and myrrh, which they were carrying into Egypt. And Judah &s;aid unto his brethren, Let us &s;ell Jo&s;eph to the I&s;hmaelites, and let not our hands be upon him, for he is our brother and our fle&s;h: And Jo&s;eph was &s;old for twenty pieces of &s;ilver. And his brethren killed a kid, and dipt his coat in the blood thereof: And they brought it unto their father, and &s;aid, This have we found.

Thus wept his father for him. But Jo&s;eph was carried into Egypt, and &s;old to Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard. And the Lord was with him, and pro&s;pered him; and he found favour in the &s;ight of his ma&s;ter. But by the wickedne&s;s of Potiphar's wife, he was ca&s;t into the pri&s;on, where the king's pri&s;oners were bound. Here al&s;o the Lord continued to &s;hew him mercy, and gave him favour in the &s;ight of the keeper of the pri&s;on. And all the pri&s;oners were committed to his care; a|mong&s;t whom were two of Pharaoh's officers, the chief of the butlers, and the chief of the bakers. And Jo&s;eph interpreted the dreams of the king's &s;ervants; and his interpretation being true, the chief butler re|commended
<PB N="198" REF="206">him to Pharaoh, who had dreamed a dream, which Jo&s;eph thus &s;hewed unto him. Behold there &s;hall come &s;even years of great plenty, through|out all the land of Egypt: And there &s;hall ari&s;e, after them, &s;even years of famine; and all the plenty &s;hall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine &s;hall con&s;ume the land.</P>
<P>And the king &s;aid unto Jo&s;eph, Fora&s;much as God hath &s;hewn thee all this, thou &s;halt be over mine hou&s;e; and according to thy word &s;hall all my people be ruled. And Jo&s;eph gathered up all the food of the &s;even years, and laid up the food in &s;torehou&s;es. Then the &s;even years of dearth began to come, as Jo&s;eph had foretold. But in all the land of Egypt there was bread; and people from all countries came unto Jo|&s;eph to buy corn, becau&s;e the famine was &s;ore in all the lands. Now, among&s;t tho&s;e that came, were the ten &s;ons of Jacob, from the land of Canaan. And Jo|&s;eph &s;aw his brethren, and he knew them, but made him&s;elf &s;trange unto them, and &s;poke roughly to them, &s;aying, Ye are &s;pies. And they &s;aid, Thy &s;ervants are twelve brethren, the &s;ons of one man in the land of Ca|naan; and behold the younge&s;t is this day with our fa|ther, and one is not.</P>
<P>But Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto them, Ye &s;hall not go forth hence, except your younge&s;t brother come hither.&mdash;Let one of your brethren be bound in pri&s;on, and go ye to carry corn for the famine of your hou&s;es, and bring your younge&s;t brother unto me. And their con&s;ciences reproached them; and they &s;aid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us. And they knew not that Jo&s;eph under&s;tood them, for he &s;pake unto them by an interpreter: And he turned him&s;elf about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them; and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. And they returned unto Jacob their father,
<PB N="199" REF="207">in the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befal|len them. And Jacob, their father, &s;aid unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Jo&s;eph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away al&s;o. But my &s;on &s;hall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: If mi&s;chief befal him in the way in which ye go, then &s;hall ye bring down my grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave. But the famine continued &s;ore in the land; and when they had eaten up the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob &s;aid unto them, Go again, and buy us food: And if it mu&s;t be &s;o, now take al&s;o your brother Benjamin, and ari&s;e and go unto the man. And they brought pre&s;ents unto Jo&s;eph, and bowed them&s;elves to him to the earth. And he a&s;ked them of their welfare; and &s;aid, Is your father well? Is he alive? And he lifted up his eyes, and &s;aw Benjamin his brother; and his bowels did yearn towards his brother; and he &s;ought where to weep, and he entered his chamber and wept there: And he wa&s;hed his face, and went out, and refrained him&s;elf. Then he com|manded the &s;teward of his hou&s;e, &s;aying, Fill the men's &s;acks with food, as much as they can carry; and put my cup, the &s;ilver cup, into the &s;ack of Benjamin, the younge&s;t. And the &s;teward did according to the word that Jo&s;eph had &s;poken. As &s;oon as the morn|ing was light, the men were &s;ent away, they and their a&s;&s;es. But Jo&s;eph commanded his &s;teward to follow them, and to &s;earch their &s;acks, and to bring them back. And when Judah and his brethren were return|ed into the city, Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? The man, in who&s;e hands the cup is found, &s;hall be my &s;ervant; and as for you, get you in peace unto your father. But they &s;aid, Our father will &s;urely die, if he &s;eeth that the lad is not with us; and we &s;hall bring down the grey hairs of thy &s;ervant, our father, with &s;orrow to the grave. Then Jo&s;eph could not refrain him&s;elf before all them that &s;tood by him; and he cried, Cau&s;e every man to
<PB N="200" REF="208">go out from me; and there &s;tood no man with him, whil&s;t Jo&s;eph made him&s;elf known unto his brethren. And he wept aloud, and &s;aid unto his brethren, I am Jo&s;eph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not an&s;wer him, for they were troubled at his pre&s;ence. And Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you; and they came near: And he &s;aid, I am Jo&s;eph your brother, whom ye &s;old into Egypt. Now, therefore, be not grieved, nor angry with your&s;elves, that ye &s;old me hither; for God did &s;end me before you, to &s;ave your lives by a great de|liverance. Ha&s;te you, and go up to my father; and &s;ay unto him, Thus &s;aith thy &s;on Jo&s;eph, God hath made me lord over all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not. And thou &s;halt dwell in the land of Go|&s;hen; and thou &s;halt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou ha&s;t: And there will I nouri&s;h thee; for yet there are five years of famine; le&s;t thou, and thy hou&s;hold, and all that thou ha&s;t, come to poverty. And behold your eyes &s;ee, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which &s;peaketh unto you. And you &s;hall tell my fa|ther of all my glory in Egypt, and all that you have &s;een; and ye &s;hall ha&s;te, and bring down my father hither.</P>
<P>And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover, he ki&s;&s;ed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that, his brethren talked with him. And the &s;ame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's hou&s;e; and it plea&s;ed Pharaoh well, and his &s;ervants. And Pharaoh &s;aid unto Jo&s;eph, Invite hither thy father and his hou&s;hold; and I will give them the good of the land of Egypt; and they &s;hall eat the fat of the land. And the &s;pirit of Jacob was revived, when he heard the&s;e tidings; and he &s;aid, My &s;on is yet alive, I will go and &s;ee him before I die. And he took his journey with all that he had. And Jo&s;eph made ready his chariot,
<PB N="201" REF="209">and went up to meet I&s;rael, his father, to Go&s;hen; and, pre&s;enting him&s;elf unto him, he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck for &s;ome time. And Jo&s;eph placed his father, and his brethren; and gave them a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the land of Egypt, in the be&s;t of the land, as Pharaoh had commanded.</P>
<P>This intere&s;ting &s;tory contains a variety of affecting incidents; is related with the mo&s;t beautiful &s;implicity; and furni&s;hes many important le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction.&mdash;It di&s;plays the mi&s;chiefs of parental partiality; the fa|tal effects of envy, jealou&s;y, and di&s;cord among&s;t breth|ren; the ble&s;&s;ings and honours with which virtue is rewarded; the amiablene&s;s of forgiving injuries; and the tender joys which flow from fraternal love, and fi|lial piety. Different, in other re&s;pects, as your lot may be from that of Jo&s;eph, you have a father, my dear ALEXIS, who feels for you all the affection which I&s;rael felt, and who hopes he has a claim to the &s;ame generous return of gratitude. You have brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who are &s;trangers to hatred, who will cheri&s;h and return your love, and who&s;e happine&s;s is in&s;epara|ble from yours: And you are under the protection and authority of that eternal Being, the God of Abraham, of I&s;aac, and of Jacob, who &s;ees, approves, and will exalt the virtuous.</P>

<P>A Chaldean pea&s;ant was conducting a goat to the city of Bagdat. He was mounted on an a&s;s; and the goat followed him, with a bell &s;u&s;pended from his neck. "I &s;hall &s;ell the&s;e animals," &s;aid he to him|&s;elf, "for thirty pieces of &s;ilver; and with this money I can purcha&s;e a new turban, and a rich ve&s;tment of
<PB N="202" REF="210">taffety, which I will tie with a &s;a&s;h of purple &s;ilk. The young dam&s;els will then &s;mile more favourably upon me; and I &s;hall be the fine&s;t man at the Mo&s;que."&mdash;Whil&s;t the pea&s;ant was thus anticipating, in idea, his future enjoyments, three artful rogues con|certed a &s;tratagem to plunder him of his pre&s;ent trea|&s;ures. As he moved &s;lowly along, one of them &s;lipped off the bell from the neck of the goat; and fa&s;tening it, without being perceived, to the tail of the a&s;s, car|ried away his booty. The man, riding upon the a&s;s and hearing the &s;ound of the bell, continued to mu&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the lo&s;s which he had &s;u&s;tained. Happening, however, a &s;hort while after|wards, to turn about his head, he di&s;covered, with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment, that the animal was gone, which con&s;tituted &s;o con&s;iderable a part of his riches: And he inquired, with the utmo&s;t anxiety, after his goat, of every traveller whom he met.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rogue now acco&s;ted him, and &s;aid, "I have ju&s;t &s;een, in yonder fields, a man in great ha&s;te, dragging along with him a goat." The pea&s;ant di&s;|mounted with precipitation, and reque&s;ted the obliging &s;tranger to hold his a&s;s, that he might lo&s;e no time in overtaking the thief. He in&s;tantly began the pur&s;uit; and, having traver&s;ed in vain the cour&s;e that was point|ed out to him, he came back fatigued and breathle&s;s to the place from whence he &s;et out; where he nei|ther found his a&s;s nor the deceitful informer, to who&s;e care he had entru&s;ted him.</P>
<P>As he walked pen&s;ively onwards, overwhelmed with &s;hame, vexation, and di&s;appointment, his attention was rou&s;ed by the loud complaints and lamentations of a poor man, who &s;at by the &s;ide of a well. He turned out of the way to &s;ympathize with a brother in afflic|tion, recounted his own misfortunes, and enquired the cau&s;e of that violent &s;orrow, which &s;eemed to oppre&s;s him. Alas! &s;aid the poor man, in the mo&s;t piteous tone of voice, as I was re&s;ting here to drink, I dropped into the water a ca&s;ket full of diamonds, which I was
<PB N="203" REF="211">employed to carry to the Caliph at Bagdat; and I &s;hall be put to death, on the &s;u&s;picion of having &s;ecreted &s;o valuable a trea&s;ure. Why do not you jump into the well in &s;earch of the ca&s;ket, cried the pea&s;ant, a&s;toni&s;h|ed at the &s;tupidity of his new acquaintance? Becau&s;e it is deep, replied the man, and I can neither dive nor &s;wim. But will you undertake this kind office for me, and I will reward you with thirty pieces of &s;ilver? The pea&s;ant accepted the offer with exultation; and, whil&s;t he was putting off his ca&s;&s;ock, ve&s;t, and &s;lippers, poured out his &s;oul in thank&s;givings to the holy pro|phet, for this providential &s;uccour. But the moment he plunged into the water, in &s;earch of the pretended ca&s;ket, the man (who was one of the three rogues that had concerted the plan of robbing him) &s;eized upon his garments, and bore them off in &s;ecurity to his comrades.</P>
<P>Thus, through inattention, &s;implicity, and credulity, was the unfortunate Chaldean duped of all his little po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and he ha&s;tened back to his cottage, with no other covering for his nakedne&s;s, than a tattered garment which he borrowed on the road.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>IMPRESSION</HI> of <HI>TRUTH</HI> on the <HI>MIND</HI> when &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;triking <HI>ANALOGY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Charles the V. had re&s;igned the &s;ceptre of Spain, and the imperial crown of Germany, he retired to the mona&s;tery of St Ju&s;tus, near the city of Placentia, in E&s;tremadura. It was &s;eated in a vale, of no great extent, watered by a &s;mall brook, and &s;ur|rounded by ri&s;ing grounds, covered with lofty trees. From the nature of the &s;oil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t healthful and delicious &s;ituation in Spain. Here he cultivated with
<PB N="204" REF="212">his own hands, the plants in his garden; and &s;ome|times he rode out to a neighbouring wood, on a little hor&s;e, attended only by a &s;ingle &s;ervant on foot. When his infirmities confined him to his apartment, and de|prived him of the&s;e more active recreations, he either admitted a few gentlemen, who re&s;ided near the mo|na&s;tery, to vi&s;it him, and entertained them familiarly at his own table; or, he employed him&s;elf in &s;tudying mechanical principles, and in forming works of me|chani&s;m, of which he had always been remarkably fond, and to which his genius was peculiarly turned. He was extremely curious with regard to the con&s;truc|tion of clocks and watches; and having found, after repeated trials, that he could not bring any two of them to go exactly alike, he reflected, with a mixture of &s;urprize as well as regret, on his own folly (as he might al&s;o on his cruelty and inju&s;tice) in having ex|exted him&s;elf, with &s;o much zeal and per&s;everance, in the more vain attempt of bringing mankind to a uni|formity of &s;entiment, concerning the doctrines of reli|gion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Robert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Charles V.</NOTE> Happy would it have been for Europe, if this ju&s;t and &s;triking analogy had occurred to the monarch, during the plenitude of his power!

<P>A Great part of mankind, if they cannot furni&s;h them&s;elves with the courage and genero&s;ity of the lion, think them&s;elves equally happy, and much wi&s;er,
<PB N="205" REF="213">with the pitiful cunning of the fox. Every word they &s;peak, however trivial the &s;ubject, is weighed before it is uttered. A di&s;gu&s;tful &s;ilence is ob&s;erved till &s;ome|body of authority has advanced an opinion, and then, with a civil leer, a doubtful and he&s;itating a&s;&s;ent is given, &s;uch as may not preclude the opportunity of a &s;ub&s;equent retraction. If the conver&s;ation turn only on the common topics of the weather, the news, the play, the opera, they are no le&s;s re&s;erved in uttering their opinion, than if their lives and fortunes depended on the &s;entiment they &s;hould at la&s;t venture to advance, with oracular dignity. Whatever may be their real idea on the &s;ubject, as truth is a trifle compared to the object of plea&s;ing tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, they generally contrive gently to agree with you; unle&s;s it &s;hould appear to them, on mature con&s;ideration, that their opinion (if contingencies to the number of at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and &s;hould take place) may, at the di&s;|tance of half a century, involve them in &s;ome &s;mall danger of giving a little offence, or of incurring a &s;mall embarra&s;&s;ment. They wear a con&s;tant &s;mile on their countenance, and are all goodne&s;s and benevo|lence, if you will believe their profe&s;&s;ions: But be|ware; for their hearts are as dark as the aby&s;&s;es which con&s;titute the abodes of the evil &s;pirit. A man of this character, as Horace &s;ays, is black, and thou, who ju&s;t|ly claime&s;t the title of an hone&s;t Engli&s;hman, be upon thy guard when thine ill fortune introduces thee into his company.</P>
<P>The&s;e crafty animals are even more re&s;erved, cau|tious, timid, and &s;erpentine, in action than in conver|&s;ation. They lay the deepe&s;t &s;chemes, and no con|clave of cardinals, no combination of con&s;pirators, no confederacy of thieves, ever deliberated with more im|penetrable &s;ecrecy. Connections are &s;ought with the mo&s;t painful &s;olicitude. No arts and no a&s;&s;iduities are neglected to obtain the favour of the great. Their hearts pant with the utmo&s;t anxiety to be introduced to a family of di&s;tinction and opulence, not only be|cau&s;e
<PB N="206" REF="214">the connection gratifies their pride, but al&s;o be|cau&s;e, in the wonderful complications and vi&s;&s;icitudes of human affairs, it may one day promote their intere&s;t. Alas! before that day arrives, their perpetual unea&s;i|ne&s;s has often put a period to their ambition, by ter|minating their exi&s;tence. But even if they gain their ends, after a youth and a manhood con&s;umed in con|&s;tant care and &s;ervitude, yet the plea&s;ure is not ade|quate to the pain, nor the advantage to the labour. Every one is ready to complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of life; to &s;pend, therefore, the greate&s;t part of it in perpetual fear, caution, &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and &s;olicitude, mere|ly to accompli&s;h an object of worldly ambition or ava|rice; what is it but the proverbial folly of him who lo&s;es a pound to &s;ave a penny? Give me, O ye pow|ers! an ingenuous man would exclaim, give me health and liberty, with a competence, and I will compa&s;&s;ion|ate the man of a timid and &s;ervile &s;oul, who has at la&s;t crept on hands and knees, through thick and thin, into a &s;tall, and &s;eated his limbs, after they have been pal&s;ied with care, on the bench of judges or of bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>Indeed, the perpetual agitation of &s;pirits, the tor|menting fears, and the ardent hopes, which alternately di&s;order the bo&s;om of the &s;ubtle and &s;u&s;picious world|ling, are more than a counterbalance to all the riches and titular honours which &s;ucce&s;sful cunning can ob|tain. What avail croziers, coronets, fortunes, man|&s;ion hou&s;es, parks, and equipages, when the poor po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of them has worn out his &s;en&s;ibility, ruined his nerves, lo&s;t his eyes, and perhaps &s;tained his honour, and wounded his con&s;cience in the toil&s;ome drudgery of the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude, from his youth up even to the hoary age of feeblene&s;s and decrepitude? When a man has a numerous offspring, it may, indeed, be generous to &s;acrifice his own ea&s;e and happine&s;s to their advancement. He may feel a virtuous plea&s;ure in his conduct, which may &s;oothe him under every cir|cum&s;tance of di&s;agreeable toil or painful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But it is obvious to ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t artful of
<PB N="207" REF="215">men, and the greate&s;t &s;laves to intere&s;t and ambition, are frequently unmarried men; and that they were unmarried, becau&s;e their caution and timidity would never permit them to take a &s;tep which could never be revoked: Them&s;elves, however unamiable, have been the only objects of their love; and the re&s;t of mankind have been made u&s;e of merely as the in&s;truments of their mean purpo&s;es and &s;elfi&s;h gratifications. But the re&s;t of mankind need not envy them, for they inflict on them&s;elves the puni&s;hments they de&s;erve. They are always craving and never &s;atisfied; they &s;uffer a torment which is ju&s;tly repre&s;ented as infernal; that of being perpetually reaching after ble&s;&s;ings which they can never gra&s;p, of being prohibited to ta&s;te the fruit, who&s;e colour appears &s;o charming to the eye, and who&s;e flavour &s;o delicious to the imagination.</P>
<P>How lovely and how happy, on the other hand, an open and ingenuous behaviour! An hone&s;t, un&s;u&s;pici|ous heart diffu&s;es a &s;erenity over life like that of a fine day, when no cloud conceals the blue aether, nor a bla&s;t ruffles the &s;tillne&s;s of the air;&mdash;but a crafty and de|&s;igning bo&s;om is all tumult and darkne&s;s, and may be &s;aid to re&s;emble a mi&s;ty and di&s;ordered atmo&s;phere in the comfortle&s;s climate of the poor Highlander. The one rai&s;es a man almo&s;t to the rank of an angel of light; the other &s;inks him to a level with the powers of dark|ne&s;s.&mdash;The one con&s;titutes a terre&s;trial heaven in the brea&s;t, the other deforms and deba&s;es it till it becomes another hell.</P>
<P>An open and ingenuous di&s;po&s;ition is not only beau|tiful and mo&s;t conducive to private happine&s;s, but pro|ductive of many virtues e&s;&s;ential to the welfare of &s;oci|ety. What is &s;ociety without confidence? But if the &s;elfi&s;h and mean &s;y&s;tem which is e&s;tabli&s;hed and recom|mended among many who&s;e advice and example have weight, &s;hould univer&s;ally prevail, in whom, and in what &s;hall we be able to confide?&mdash;It is already &s;hock|ing to a liberal mind to ob&s;erve what a multitude of papers, parchments, oaths, and &s;olemn engagements is
<PB N="208" REF="216">required, even in a trivial negociation. On the con|trary, how comfortable and how honourable to human nature, if promi&s;es were bonds, and a&s;&s;ertions affidavits! What plea&s;ure and what improvement would be deri|ved from conver&s;ation, if every one would dare to &s;peak his real &s;entiments, with mode&s;ty and decorum indeed, but without any unmanly fear of offending, or &s;ervile de&s;ire to plea&s;e for the &s;ake of intere&s;t? To plea&s;e by hone&s;t means, and from the pure motives of friend&s;hip and philanthropy, is a duty; but they who &s;tudy the art of plea&s;ing merely for their own &s;akes, are, of all characters, tho&s;e which ought lea&s;t to plea&s;e, and which appear, when the ma&s;que is removed, the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t|ful. Truth, and &s;implicity of manners, are not only e&s;&s;ential to virtue and happine&s;s, but, as objects of ta&s;te, truly beautiful. Good minds will always be plea&s;ed with them, and bad minds we need not wi&s;h to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Since cunning and deceit are thus odious in them|&s;elves, and incompatible with real happine&s;s and dig|nity, I cannot help thinking, that tho&s;e in&s;tructors of the ri&s;ing generation, who have in&s;i&s;ted on &s;imulation and di&s;&s;imulation, on the thou&s;and tricks of worldly wi&s;dom, are no le&s;s mi&s;taken in their ideas, than mean, contracted, and illiberal. Li&s;ten not, ye generous young men, who&s;e hearts are yet untainted, li&s;ten not to the delu&s;ive advice of men &s;o deluded or &s;o ba&s;e. Have courage enough to avow the &s;entiments of your &s;ouls, and let your countenance and your tongue be the heralds of your hearts. Plea&s;e, con&s;i&s;tently with truth and honour, or be contented not to plea&s;e. Let ju&s;tice and benevolence fill your bo&s;om, and they will &s;hine &s;pontaneou&s;ly, like the real gem, without the aid of a foil, and with the mo&s;t durable and captivating brilliancy.</P>

<P>But there yet may remain a remedy. Let tho&s;e, who are mi&s;erable among riches and grandeur, leave, for a moment, their elevated rank, and de&s;cend from their palaces to the humble habitations of real and unaffect|ed woe. If their hearts are not de&s;titute of feeling, they will return from the &s;ad &s;cenes to their clo&s;ets, and on their knees pour forth the ejaculations of grati|tude to that univer&s;al Parent, who has given them abundance, and exempted them from the thou&s;and ills, under the pre&s;&s;ure of which the greater part of his children drag the load of life. In&s;tead of &s;pending their hours in brooding over their own imaginary evils, they will devote them to the alleviation of real mi&s;ery among the de&s;titute &s;ons of indigence, in the neglected walks of vulgar life.</P>
<P>That one half of the world knows not how the other half lives, is a common and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation. A fine lady, &s;urrounded with every means of accommodation and luxury, complains, in a moment of dejection, that &s;urely no mortal is &s;o wretched as her&s;elf. Her &s;uffer|ings are too great for her acute &s;en&s;ibility. She ex|pects
<PB N="210" REF="218">pity from all her acquaintance, and plea&s;es her|&s;elf with the idea that &s;he is an example of &s;ingular mi&s;|fortune and remarkable patience. Phy&s;icians attend, and with affected &s;olicitude feel the healthy pul&s;e, which, however, they dare not pronounce healthy, le&s;t they &s;hould give offence by attempting to &s;poil the re|fined luxury of fancied woe. To be &s;uppo&s;ed always ill, and con&s;equently to be always exciting the tender attention and enquiries of all around, is a &s;tate &s;o charming in the ideas of the weak, luxurious, and in|dolent minds of &s;ome fa&s;hionable ladies, that many &s;pend their lives in a perpetual &s;tate of imaginary con|vale&s;cence. There is &s;omething &s;o indelicate in being hale, hearty, and &s;tout, like a ro&s;y milk-maid, that a very fine and very high-bred lady is almo&s;t ready to &s;aint at the idea. From exce&s;&s;ive indulgence, &s;he be|comes at la&s;t in reality, what &s;he at fir&s;t only fancied her&s;elf, a perpetual invalid. By a ju&s;t retribution, &s;he is really puni&s;hed with that wretchedne&s;s of which &s;he ungratefully and unrea&s;onably complained in the mid&s;t of health, ea&s;e, and opulence.</P>
<P>One might a&s;k all the &s;i&s;terhood and fraternity of rich and healthy murmurers, Have you compared your &s;ituation and circum&s;tances with that of tho&s;e of your fellow-creatures who are condemned to labour in the gold mines of Peru? Have you compared your &s;itua|tion with that of tho&s;e of your own country, who have hardly ever &s;een the &s;un, but live confined in tin mines, lead mines, &s;tone quarries, and coal pits? Before you call your&s;elf wretched, take a &s;urvey of the gaols, in which unfortunate and hone&s;t debtors are doomed to pine for life; walk through the wards of an ho&s;pital; think of the hard&s;hips of a common &s;oldier or &s;ailor; think of the galley-&s;lave, the day-labourer; nay, the common &s;ervant in your own hou&s;e; think of your poor neighbour at the next door; and if there were not danger of its being called unpolite and methodi&s;ti|cal, I would add, think of Him who, for your &s;ake, &s;weated, as it were, drops of blood on Calvary.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="219">It is, indeed, a duty to con&s;ider the evils of tho&s;e who are placed beneath us; for the chief purpo&s;e of chri&s;tianity is, to alleviate the mi&s;eries of that part of mankind, whom, indeed, the world de&s;pi&s;es; but whom, He who made them, pities, like as a father pitieth his own children. Their mi&s;eries are not fan|ciful, their complaints are not exaggerated. The cler|gy, when they are called upon to vi&s;it the &s;ick, or to baptize new-born infants, are often &s;pectators of &s;uch &s;cenes as would cure the di&s;contented of every malady. The following repre&s;entation is but too real, and may be paralleled in many of its circum&s;tances in almo&s;t every pari&s;h throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter of a country village was called upon to baptize an infant ju&s;t born. The cottage was &s;ituated on a lonely common, and as it was in the mid&s;t of the winter, and the floods were out, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to wade in water through the lower room to a lad|der, which &s;erved in&s;tead of &s;tairs. The chamber (and it was the only one) was &s;o low, that you could not &s;tand upright in it; there was one window which ad|mitted air as freely as light, for the rags which had been &s;tuffed into the broken panes were now taken out to contribute to the covering of the infant. In a dark corner of the room &s;tood a &s;mall bed&s;tead without fur|niture, and on it lay the dead mother, who had ju&s;t expired in labour for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The father was &s;itting on a little &s;tool by the fire-place, though there was no fire, and endeavouring to keep the infant warm in his bo&s;om. Five of the &s;even children, half naked, were a&s;king their father for a piece of bread, while a fine boy, of about three years old, was &s;tand|ing by his mother at the bed-&s;ide, and crying as he was wont to do, "Take me, take me, mammy!"&mdash;"Mam|my is a&s;leep," &s;aid one of his &s;i&s;ters, with two tears &s;tanding on her cheeks; "mammy is a&s;leep, Johnny, go play with the baby on daddy's knee." The father took him up on his knee, and his grief, which had hitherto kept him dumb, and in a &s;tate of temporary
<PB N="212" REF="220">in&s;en&s;ibility, bur&s;t out in a torrent of tears, and reliev|ed his heart, which &s;eemed ready to break. "Don't cry, pray don't cry," &s;aid the elde&s;t boy, "the nur&s;e is coming up &s;tairs with a two-penny loaf in her hand, and mammy will wake pre&s;ently, and I will carry her the large&s;t piece." Upon this, an old woman, crooked with age, and clothed in tatters, came hobbling on her little &s;tick into the room, and, after heaving a groan, calmly &s;at down, dre&s;&s;ed the child in its rags, then di|vided the loaf as far as it would go, and informed the poor man that the church-wardens, to whom &s;he had gone, would &s;end &s;ome relief, as &s;oon as they had di&s;|patched a naughty baggage to her own pari&s;h, who had delivered her&s;elf of twins in the e&s;quire's hovel. Relief indeed was &s;ent, and a little contribution afterwards rai&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of the mini&s;ter. If he had not &s;een the ca&s;e, it would have pa&s;&s;ed on as a common affair, and a thing of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters and medical practitioners are often witne&s;|&s;es to &s;cenes even more wretched than this; where, to poverty, cold, nakedne&s;s, and death, are added the lan|guors of lingering and loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, and the tor|ments of excruciating pain. A feeling heart, among the rich and the great, who are at the &s;ame time que|rulous without cau&s;e, would learn a le&s;&s;on in many a garret of Broad St. Giles's or Shoreditch, more effica|cious than all the lectures of the moral or divine philo|&s;opher.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> RESIGNATION <HI>of the</HI> EMPEROR CHARLES V.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES re&s;olved to re&s;ign his kingdoms to his &s;on, with a &s;olemnity &s;uitable to the importance of the tran&s;action; and to perform this la&s;t act of &s;overeignty with &s;uch formal pomp, as might leave an indelible impre&s;&s;ion on the minds, not only of his &s;ub|jects, but of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. With this view, he called Philip out of England, where the peevi&s;h temper of his queen, which increa&s;ed with her de&s;pair of having i&s;|&s;ue, rendered him extremely unhappy; and the jea|lou&s;y of the Engli&s;h left him no hopes of obtaining the direction of their affairs. Having a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the Low Countries, at Bru&s;&s;els, on the twenty-fifth of October, one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-five,
<PB N="214" REF="222">Chales &s;eated him&s;elf, for the la&s;t time, in the chair of &s;tate; on one &s;ide of which was placed his &s;on, and on the other his &s;i&s;ter the queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands; with a &s;pendid retinue of the gran|dees of Spain, and princes of the empire, &s;tanding be|hind him. The pre&s;ident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained in a few words, his inten|tion in calling this extraordinary meeting of the &s;tates. He then read the in&s;trument of re&s;ignation, by which Charles &s;urrendered to his &s;on Philip all his territories, juri&s;diction, and authority in the Low Countries; ab|&s;olving his &s;ubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to transfer to Philip, his lawful heir, and to &s;erve him with the &s;ame loyalty and zeal, which they had manife&s;ted, during &s;o long a cour&s;e of years, in &s;upport of his government.</P>
<P>Charles then ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and leaning on the &s;houlder of the prince of Orange, becau&s;e he was una|ble to &s;tand without &s;upport, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the audience, and, from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory, he recounted with dignity, but without o&s;tentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed &s;ince the commencement of his admini&s;tration. He ob&s;erved, that, from the &s;eventeenth year of his age, he had de|dicated all his thoughts and attention to public objects; re&s;erving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his ea&s;e, and very little for the enjoyment of private plea&s;ure: That, either in a pacific or ho&s;tile manner, he had vi&s;ited Germany nine times, Spain &s;ix times, France four times, Italy &s;even times, the Low Coun|tries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by &s;ea: That, while his health permitted him to di&s;charge his duty, and the vigour of his con&s;titution was equal, in any degree, to the ardu|ous office of governing &s;uch exten&s;ive dominions, he had never &s;hunned labour, nor repined under fatigue: That now, when his health was broken, and his vigour exhau&s;ted by the rage of an incurable di&s;temper, his
<PB N="215" REF="223">growing infirmities admoni&s;hed him to retire; nor was he &s;o fond of reigning, as to retain the &s;ceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his &s;ubjects, or to render them happy: That, in&s;tead of a &s;overeign worn out with di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;carcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accu&s;tomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth, all the attention and &s;agacity of maturer years: That if, during the cour&s;e of a long admini&s;tration, he had committed any material error in government; or if, under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o many and great affairs, and amid&s;t the attention which he had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected, or injured any of his &s;ubjects, he now implored their forgivene&s;s: That for his part, he &s;hould ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the remem|brance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation, as well as the be&s;t reward for all his &s;ervices; and, in his la&s;t prayers to Almighty God, would pour forth his ardent wi&s;hes for their wel|fare.</P>
<P>Then, turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees, and ki&s;&s;ed his father's hand, "If," &s;ays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made &s;uch large additions, &s;ome regard would have been ju&s;tly due to my memory on that account: But now, when I voluntarily re&s;ign to you what I might &s;till have retained, I may well expect the warme&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ions of thanks on your part. With the&s;e, how|ever, I di&s;pen&s;e; and &s;hall con&s;ider your concern for the welfare of your &s;ubjects, and your love of them, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t acceptable te&s;timony of your gra|titude to me. It is in your power, by a wi&s;e and vir|tuous admini&s;tration, to ju&s;tify the extraordinary proof which I this day give of my paternal affection; and to demon&s;trate, that you are worthy of the confidence which I repo&s;e in you, pre&s;erve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be &s;acred in your eyes;
<PB N="216" REF="224">encroach not on the rights and privileges of your peo|ple: And, if the time &s;hall ever come, when you &s;hall wi&s;h to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a &s;on endowed with &s;uch qualities, that you can re&s;ign your &s;ceptre to him with as much &s;atisfaction as I give up mine to you!"</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Charles had fini&s;hed this long addre&s;s to his &s;ubjects, and to their new &s;overeign, he &s;unk into the chair exhau&s;ted, and ready to faint with the fatigue of &s;uch an extraordinary effort. During his di&s;cour&s;e, the whole audience melted into tears; &s;ome, from ad|miration of his magnanimity; others, &s;oftened by the expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s towards his &s;on, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow, at lo&s;ing a &s;overeign, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed the Netherlands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</P>
<P>A few weeks afterwards, Charles, in an a&s;&s;embly no le&s;s &s;pendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, re&s;igned to his &s;on the crowns of Spain, with all the territories depending on them, both in the Old and in the New World. Of all the&s;e va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he re|&s;erved nothing to him&s;elf, but an annual pen&s;ion of a hundred thou&s;and crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a &s;mall &s;um for acts of bene|ficence and charity.</P>
<P>The place he had cho&s;en for his retreat, was the mo|na&s;tery of St. Ju&s;tus, in the province of E&s;tremadura. It was &s;eated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a &s;mall brook, and &s;urrounded by ri&s;ing grounds, cover|ed with lofty trees. From the nature of the &s;oil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t healthful and delicious &s;ituation in Spain. Some months before his re&s;ignation, he had &s;ent an architect thither, to add a new apartment to the mo|na&s;tery, for his accommodation; but he gave &s;trict or|ders, that the &s;tyle of building &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;uited his pre&s;ent &s;ituation rather than his former dignity. It con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix rooms; four of them in the form
<PB N="217" REF="225">of friars' cells, with naked walls; the other two, each twenty feet &s;quare, were hung with brown cloth, and furni&s;hed in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one &s;ide, into a garden, of which Charles him&s;elf had given the plan, and which he had filled with various plants, in|tending to cultivate them with his own hands. On the other &s;ide, they communicated with the chapel of the mona&s;tery, in which he was to perform his devo|tions. Into this humble retreat, hardly &s;ufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve dome&s;tics only. He buried there, in &s;olitude and &s;ilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all tho&s;e va&s;t projects which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Eu|rope, filling every kingdom in it, by turns, with the terror of his arms, and the dread of being &s;ubjected to his power.</P>

The misfor|tunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declamation; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble &s;ufferers: The great, under the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity, are con&s;cious of

<P>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing misfor|tunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: Men in &s;uch circum&s;tances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but the who, in the vale of ob|&s;curity, can brave adver&s;ity; who, without friends to pity, or even without hope to alleviate, his misfortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indifference, is truly great; whether pea&s;ant or courtier, he de&s;erves admi|ration, and &s;hould be held up for our imitation and re|&s;pect.</P>

<P>"I was born in Shrop&s;hire; my father was a la|bourer, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born, &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pari&s;h at all; but at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;ol|ved, at lea&s;t, to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the workhou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my la|bour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away; but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me.
<PB N="222" REF="230">I was then bound out to farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re&s;olved to go &s;eek my fortune.</P>
<P>"In this manner I went from town to town, work|ed when I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none: When happening one day to go through a field belonging to a ju&s;tice of the peace, I &s;py'd a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it:&mdash;Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me; he called me a poacher and a villain; and, collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my|&s;elf. I fell upon my knees, begged his wor&s;hip's par|don, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and generation; but, though I gave a very true account, the ju&s;tice &s;aid I could give no ac|count; &s;o I was indicted at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to London to Newgate, in or|der to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>"People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail, but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life. I had my belly-full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent off, with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age, for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remained were &s;ickly enough, God knows. When we came a-&s;hore, we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;ev|en years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to to do.</P>
<P>"When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="223" REF="231">home, and glad was I to &s;ee Old England again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when I could get them.</P>
<P>"I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand.&mdash;They belonged to a pre&s;s-gang: I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier: I cho&s;e the latter; and, in this po&s;t of a gentleman, I &s;erved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battle of Val and Fontenoy, and received but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</P>
<P>"When the peace came on I was di&s;charged; and, as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a landman in the Ea&s;t-India company's &s;ervice. I have fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and I verily believe that, if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a cor|poral. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to re|turn home again with forty pounds in my pocket.&mdash;This was at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money; but the government wanted men, and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor before ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</P>
<P>"The boat&s;wain found me, as he &s;aid, and ob&s;tinate fellow: He &s;wore he knew that I under&s;tood my bu&s;i|ne&s;s well, but that I &s;hammed Abraham, to be idle; but, God knows, I knew nothing of &s;ea-bu&s;ine&s;s, and he beat me, without co&s;idering what he was about. I had &s;till, however, my forty pounds, and that was &s;ome comfort to me under every beating; and the money I
<PB N="224" REF="232">might have had to this day, but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t all.</P>
<P>"Our crew was carried into Bre&s;t, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jail; but, for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea|&s;oned. One night, as I was a&s;leep on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, for I always loved to lie well, I was awakened by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand: 'Jack,' &s;ays he to me, 'will you knock out the French centry's brains?' 'I don't care,' &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake, 'if I lend a hand.' 'Then follow me,' &s;ays he, 'and I hope we &s;hall do bu&s;ine&s;s.' So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French, becau&s;e they are all &s;laves, and wear wooden &s;hoes.</P>
<P>"Though we had no arms, one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries were po&s;ted, and, ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the quay, and &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dor&s;et privateer, who were glad of &s;o many good hands, and we con&s;ented to run our chance. How|ever, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; &s;o to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight la&s;ted for three hours, and I verily believe we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had &s;ome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we lo&s;t all our men ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory.</P>
<P>"I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Bre&s;t; but, by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you
<PB N="225" REF="233">that, in that engagement, I was wounded in two pla|ces; I lo&s;t four &s;ingers off the left hand, and my leg was &s;hot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and u&s;e of my hand on board a king's &s;hip, and not a-board a privateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the re&s;t of my life! But that was not my chance: One man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I enjoy good health, and will for ever love liberty and Old England. Liberty, property, and Old England for ever, huzza!"</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he limped off, leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content; nor could I avoid ac|knowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with mi&s;e|ry, &s;erves better than philo&s;ophy to teach us to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> STORY <HI>of</HI> ABBAS.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;THE &s;un appearing above the horizon, So|lyman pro&s;trated him&s;elf in the profound|e&s;t adoration. When he aro&s;e from his devotions, he advanced towards the Engli&s;h merchant, his fellow-traveller, with a look of kindne&s;s mixed with pity and concern. The merchant under&s;tood him: But as he was unwilling to controvert the principles of his reli|gion, he made no apology for his conduct during the devotions of Solyman.</P>
<P>The mild morning light which was diffu&s;ed over the vallies and &s;treams, the various beauty of the mea|dows, the regular di&s;po&s;ition of blo&s;&s;omed hedge-rows, the &s;oothing murmur of bees at their early labour, and the full concert of the feathered creation, drew their conver&s;ation on the univer&s;al beneficence of nature.&mdash;'I feel,' &s;aid Solyman, 'a delight, which I can neither
<PB N="228" REF="236">account for nor de&s;cribe. The&s;e mountains gilded with the rays of the orient &s;un, tho&s;e painted vallies that &s;hame the rich carpets of Per&s;ia, yon di&s;tant wa|ters which gleam with the &s;hifting effulgence of light, the general bu&s;y voice of joy and activity in the animal creation, con&s;pire to fill my heart with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure.'</P>
<P>'That plea&s;ure,' replied the merchant, 'I believe proceeds from &s;ympathy: It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s you have &s;ome peculiar cau&s;e of mi&s;ery, not to be plea|&s;ed when you &s;ee every thing around you happy. On the contrary, if you go into the man&s;ions of &s;orrow, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the infection of it.&mdash;The God of nature &s;eems to have given us the&s;e &s;ym|pathetic feelings, to link our affections in the great chain of &s;ociety: Hence, &s;ocial virtue is not left to de|pend &s;olely on the moral will, but is founded on the principles of our nature.</P>
<P>'But the object of your adoration is &s;o profu&s;e of his favours, that I &s;hould now be glad to find &s;ome convenient &s;hade. I think, I di&s;cover a cave on the &s;outhern declivity of the mountain; let us retire to it during the heat of they day.'</P>
<P>As they were advancing towards the cave, they per|ceived a beaten path, leading directly from it to a di&s;|tant rivulet: This made them apprehen&s;ive that it might be the habitation of &s;ome wild bea&s;t, that had worn the path by con&s;tantly going to drink at the &s;tream: But their fears were &s;oon removed upon the appearance of an aged hermit, advancing &s;lowly towards the rivulet with an earthen pitcher. At &s;ight of the travellers, he ha&s;ted to his abode with all the feeble precipitancy of age: They agreed not to di&s;turb him, and only took the advantage of the rock which projected over his cell to &s;helter them&s;elves from the &s;un; but they had not long continued in this &s;ituation, before the hermit, perceiving them to be inoffen&s;ive travellers, invited them into his cave.</P>
<P>'You will excu&s;e,' &s;aid the hoary &s;age, 'the cau|tion
<PB N="229" REF="237">of years: The&s;e mountains are not &s;ecure from the ravage of human ferocity; and the&s;e grey hairs would be no defence from the wanton cruelty of man. I have &s;uffered &s;o much from my own &s;pecies, that I have at la&s;t for&s;aken their &s;ociety: I thought it better to give up the conveniences of it, than to bear the evils; and I have long lived in this &s;olitary cave on nothing more than what uncultivated nature would afford me.'&mdash;'Tho&s;e &s;ufferings,' &s;aid Solyman, 'mu&s;t, indeed, have been extraordinary, that could make you give up one of the greate&s;t advantages of life, the &s;oci|al intercour&s;e of your fellow-creatures.'&mdash;'The narra|tives of age,' replied the hermit, 'are &s;eldom agreea|ble to youth; but as in&s;truction can be gained only from experience, you will do wi&s;ely to learn it from the misfortunes of Abbas.</P>
<P>'I was born to a competent fortune in the province of Lure&s;tan: But being early left an orphan, my affairs came under the cognizance of a ju&s;ticiary court, which the members of it call the court of equity; but &s;o equi|table were they with regard to me, that they claimed two parts of my little fortune for their care of the third.'&mdash;'Would to God, that were never the ca&s;e in Great Britain!' interrupted the merchant. 'But pro|ceed.'&mdash;'Though I had &s;uch an early and convincing proof of the treachery and rapacity of mankind; yet, as I had always exerci&s;ed the benevolent virtues my&s;elf, I could not think others totally devoid of them; and at my three and twentieth year being inclined to travel, I without &s;cruple entru&s;ted the remains of my fortune with a per&s;on whom I had long known and re&s;pected; a per&s;on, Holy Allah! who lifted his hands to thee; but I had not been ab&s;ent from Lure&s;tan more than three moons, when he pretended a commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;po&s;e of my effects, and immediately left the place. Upon my return therefore to the province, I found neither friend nor fortune; and being bred to no bu&s;ine&s;s, I was re|duced to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of indigence. I ap|plied, however, not without hopes of redre&s;s or relief,
<PB N="230" REF="238">to a per&s;on of power and eminence, whom I had often heard &s;peak of his friend&s;hip with my father. After long and frequent attendance, I was admitted to an in|terview. I laid open my di&s;tre&s;s to him with that kind of eloquence which the mi&s;eries we &s;uffer from the treachery of others always &s;ugge&s;ts; and which, how|ever unaffecting it may be to indifferent per&s;ons, utters its complaints with dignity and re&s;entment. I was heard half-way through my &s;tory, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the following reply:' "It is not nece&s;&s;ary, young man, to proceed with your complaints; I perceive you have been abu&s;ed, and I am &s;orry for you. But that &s;hall not be the only proof of my regard for you; I will give you a little advice: You &s;hould never depend &s;o much on the benevolence or integrity of any human being, as to tru&s;t him with your fortune or your life." 'Thus ended my hopes from the friend of my father; who&s;e benevolence extended no farther, than to in&s;truct me how to &s;ecure the fortune that was &s;tolen, and to pre&s;erve the life which I wi&s;hed to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>'I had now no choice, but to enter, as a common &s;oldier, into the army of the Sophi. I had always de|lighted in martial exerci&s;es, and was expert in the u&s;e of arms: My dexterity and addre&s;s drew upon me the attention of my officers; and, in a &s;hort time, I obtain|ed a &s;mall commi&s;&s;ion. I had now almo&s;t forgot my mi&s;eries, and embraced my new &s;ituation with chear|fulne&s;s and hope; but fortune, who had for a while cea&s;ed to per&s;ecute me as below her notice, as if &s;he had been indignant at my &s;atisfaction, and jealous of my pro&s;pects, now renewed and redoubled her &s;eve|rity.</P>
<P>'My commanding officer had a daughter of extra|ordinary beauty, and an uncommon capacity. Zara was the object of univer&s;al admiration; but &s;he had &s;et her heart on the unfortunate Abbas. The fir&s;t mo|ment I beheld her, I di&s;covered in her looks the mo&s;t tender and affectionate regard for me, which I imputed to her compa&s;&s;ion for my misfortunes; though at the
<PB N="231" REF="239">&s;ame time I wi&s;hed, without knowing why, that it might proceed from another cau&s;e. She a&s;ked me for the &s;tory of my life: I told it in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t pathetic manner; yet, when I had fini&s;hed, &s;he de&s;ired me to repeat it. From this moment I had done with peace; her infectious tenderne&s;s had &s;uch an influence upon my heart, that I could think of nothing but Zara; without Zara I was mi&s;erable. A thou&s;and times did I flatter my&s;elf, that there was &s;omething more than mere compa&s;&s;ion in her look and manner; and not many days had pa&s;&s;ed, before I was convinced of the dear fatal truth from this letter:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>To</HI> ABBAS.</P>
<P>'YOUR merit and your &s;ufferings have a claim to &s;omething more than compa&s;&s;ion: To e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of Abbas, is to di&s;charge a duty which virtue cannot di&s;pen&s;e with. Meet me on the parade this evening, and you &s;hall know more of the &s;entiments of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ZARA."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>'The emotions I felt on the receipt of this letter, can only be conceived by tho&s;e who, in the mid&s;t of de&s;pairing love, have beheld a gleam of hope. The tu|mult of my heart hurried me to the place appointed, long before the time: I walked backward and forward in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, totally regardle&s;s of every ob|ject about me; &s;ometimes rai&s;ing my hands and eyes in the &s;udden effu&s;ions of tran&s;port, and &s;ometimes &s;mi|ling with the complacency of delight.</P>
<P>'At length the day departed; and Zara came. My heart bounded at her &s;ight: I was unable to &s;peak, and threw my&s;elf at her feet. She was alarmed at my ex|ce&s;&s;ive earne&s;tne&s;s and confu&s;ion; but, commanding me to ri&s;e, "Abbas," &s;aid &s;he, "if your confu&s;ion proceeds from your mode&s;t gratitude, re&s;train it, till you find whether I am able to &s;erve you; if it ari&s;e
<PB N="232" REF="240">from any other cau&s;e, I mu&s;t leave you this moment" 'I entreated &s;he would tell me, to what I was indebted for the happine&s;s of this interview, and I would be calm and attentive?' "My regard for your merit, and my compa&s;&s;ion for your &s;ufferings," &s;aid &s;he, "make me wi&s;h to &s;erve you. Tell me, Abbas, can I a&s;&s;i&s;t you through the intere&s;t of my father?" I faltered out my acknowledgments; telling her, that to her I mu&s;t owe all my hopes of future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>'She left me immediately without reply. The &s;in|gularity of my behaviour on the parade before the coming of Zara, had drawn upon me the attention of an officer who was &s;ecretly her admirer, and who, ei|ther through curio&s;ity or &s;u&s;picion, though unob&s;erved by me, had waited at a convenient di&s;tance to watch my motions. No &s;ooner did he perceive the approach of Zara, than, as well to gratify his revenge, as to in|gratiate him&s;elf with her father, he immediately told him of our interview.</P>
<P>'Zara, ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed, with her u&s;ual freedom and good-nature, began to expre&s;s her-com|pa&s;&s;ion for the misfortunes of Abbas, talked of his me|rits, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee him preferred. The old gene|ral, who was naturally jealous and impetuous, exclaim|ed, with a bur&s;t of indignation, "Yes, I &s;hall prefer him!"

<P>"By &s;ome unlucky circum&s;tance, which I do not now under&s;tand, in&s;tead of promoting you, I have been the cau&s;e of your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.

</LETTER>
<P>'In the angui&s;h and confu&s;ion of my heart, I fol|lowed my guide, without knowing whither he was leading me, or what I was about to do. I vented my grief in broken ejaculations, frequently calling upon the name of Zara, but not once addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to my attendant. By the evening of the &s;econd day, we had advanced forty miles &s;outhward from the province of Lure&s;tan; when&mdash;how &s;hall I relate the la&s;t horrid &s;cene of my mi&s;eries!&mdash;pardon me!&mdash;the&s;e aged eyes have yet a tear left, yet a tear for the memory of Zara!&mdash;we were attacked by a band of robbers. My guide was Zara! in her fright &s;he threw off her ma&s;k, and cried, "Zara!" Love, rage, fear, and vengeance, gave me &s;upernatural &s;trength: Three of the villains fell by my &s;abre; a fourth di&s;armed me; and the re&s;t of the gang carried off Zara.'</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is of his &s;tory, the &s;pirits of the aged her|mit were exhau&s;ted by their own violence; and it was &s;ome time before he could proceed.</P>
<P>'You have now,' continued he, 'heard the com|pletion of my misfortunes. When I was recovered of the wounds I had received, I &s;pent &s;ome months in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch of Zara: At la&s;t, de&s;pairing to gain any intelligence of her, I tran&s;mitted an account of the af|fair to her father; not without hope, that his power, or his wealth, might be a means of finding her out, and redeeming her: But I was deceived; and had &s;oon the mortification to hear, that the unnatural wretch exulted in our misfortunes, and uttered the mo&s;t dreadful im|precations on his only child.</P>
<P>'Deprived of hope, and dejected with melancholy, I could no longer bear the &s;ociety of mankind: I there|fore
<PB N="234" REF="242">betook my&s;elf to the&s;e &s;olitary mountains, where this cell has been my habitation for years, that have pa&s;&s;ed away in unvaried &s;orrow; and where you are the fir&s;t of human beings that have heard me tell my tale.'</P>
<P>Solyman expatiated on the &s;ufferings of Abbas with the mo&s;t tender &s;en&s;ibility, and inveighed again&s;t the ba&s;ene&s;s of mankind with all the rage of hone&s;t re&s;ent|ment. 'Surely,' &s;aid he to the merchant, 'man is the vile&s;t of all creatures! in proportion as he excels them in rea&s;on, he exceeds them in the ability to do mi&s;chief; and being equally cruel, the mi&s;chief he does renders him more dete&s;table. Sacred Mithra! why do&s;t thou lend thy light to the villain and the tyrant? Were it not for the enjoyment of your company, my friend, I &s;hould have few inducements to go farther from the valley of Irwan; for po&s;&s;ibly to &s;ee more of human life, is only to know more of its crimes and mi&s;eries.'</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> GRATEFUL TURK.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time when the Venetians and Turks were at war, one of the &s;hips of the latter was taken and carried into Venice, where the crew were all &s;old for &s;laves. One of the&s;e unhappy people happened to live oppo&s;ite the hou&s;e of a rich Venetian, who had an only &s;on, then in the twelfth year of his age. The little youth u&s;ed frequently to &s;top and gaze at Hamet, for
<PB N="235" REF="243">&s;uch was the name of the &s;lave, and at la&s;t, an acquaint|ance commenced between them.</P>
<P>Though Hamet &s;eemed always delighted with the tender regards of his little friend, yet the latter fre|quently ob&s;erved, that involuntary tears trickled down the cheeks of Hamet. The little youth at la&s;t &s;poke of it to his father, and begged of him, if he could, to make Hamet happy.</P>
<P>Hereupon the father determined to &s;ee the &s;lave, and talk to him him&s;elf. He went to him the next day, and a&s;ked him if he were the Hamet, of whom his &s;on had &s;poken &s;o kindly. He replied, that he was the unfortunate Hamet, who had been three years a cap|tive; and that during that time, his little &s;on was the only per&s;on who had in the lea&s;t pitied his misfortunes. "And I, night and morning," added he, "offer up my prayers to that power, who is equally the God of Turks and Chri&s;tians, to &s;hower down upon his head every ble&s;&s;ing he de&s;erves, and to pre&s;erve him from mi&s;eries like mine."</P>
<P>The Venetian merchant then entered into clo&s;er conver&s;ation with Hamet, and could not help admiring his generous &s;entiments and manly fortitude. He a&s;k|ed him what he would do to regain his liberty. "What would I do?" an&s;wered Hamet, "By the eternal Ma|je&s;ty of Heaven, I would chearfully face every danger, and even death it&s;elf, in whatever &s;hape it might ap|pear!"</P>
<P>The merchant then told him, that the means of his deliverance were in his own hands. "Hear me at|tentively," &s;aid the merchant. "An inveterate foe of mine lives in this city, and has heaped upon me every injury that can &s;ting the heart of man. He is as brave as he is haughty, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that his &s;trength and valour prevent my attempting per&s;onally to revenge my wrongs. Now, Hamet, take this dagger, and as &s;oon as the &s;hade of night &s;hall envelope the city, I will lead you to the place, where you may at once re|venge the injuries of your friends, and regain your own freedom."</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="244">Scorn and contempt now flamed in the eyes of Ha|met, and, as &s;oon as his pa&s;&s;ion had a lattle &s;ub&s;ided, he exclaimed, "O gracious prophet! are the&s;e the wretches by whom you &s;uffer your faithful &s;ervants to be en&s;laved! Go, wicked Chri&s;tian, and be a&s;&s;ured, that Hamet would not become an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in for all the riches of Venice, or to purcha&s;e the freedom of his whole race!" The merchant coolly replied, that he was &s;orry he had offended him, but thought that he prized his freedom at a higher rate; and added, as he turned his back, "You will perhaps change your mind to|morrow, after you &s;hall have more maturely reflected on the matter," and he then left him.</P>
<P>The next day, the merchant, accompanied by his &s;on, returned to Hamet, and was going to renew his for|mer conver&s;ation, when the hone&s;t Turk exclaimed, with a &s;evere and fixed countenance, "Chri&s;tian! cea&s;e to in&s;ult the mi&s;erable with propo&s;als more &s;hock|ing than death it&s;elf! The Chri&s;tian religion may tole|rate &s;uch acts, but to a Mahometan they are an abo|mination!"</P>
<P>Franci&s;co, for &s;uch was the name of the Venetian merchant, now tenderly embraced Hamet, and begged he would forgive the trial to which he put his virtue, a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time, that his &s;oul abhorred all deeds of blood and treachery, as much as Hamet him&s;elf. "From this moment," &s;aid the merchant, "you are free; your ran&s;om is paid, and you are at liberty to go where you plea&s;e. Perhaps, hereafter, when you &s;ee an unhappy Chri&s;tian groaning in Turki&s;h fetters, your genero&s;ity may bring Venice to your re|membrance."</P>
<P>The feelings of Hamet at this unexpected deliverance are not to be de&s;cribed. Franci&s;co put him on board a &s;hip, which was bound to one of the Grecian i&s;lands, and, after taking leave of him in the tendere&s;t manner, forced him to accept of a pur&s;e of gold to pay his ex|pences. Affectionate was the parting of Hamet with
<PB N="237" REF="245">his little friend, whom he embraced in an agony of tenderne&s;s, wept over him, and implored Heaven to grant him all the ble&s;&s;ings of this life.</P>
<P>About &s;ix months afterwards, one morning, while the family were all in bed, Franci&s;co's hou&s;e was di&s;|covered to be on fire, and great part of the hou&s;e was in flames before the family was alarmed. The terrified &s;ervants had but ju&s;t time to awaken Franci&s;co, who was no &s;ooner got into the &s;treet, than the whole &s;tair|ca&s;e gave way, and fell into the flames.</P>
<P>If the merchant thought him&s;elf happy on having &s;aved him&s;elf, it was only for a moment, as he &s;oon recollected, that his beloved &s;on was left behind to the mercy of the flames. He &s;unk into the deepe&s;t de&s;pair, when upon enquiry he found, that his &s;on, who &s;lept in an upper apartment, had been forgotten in the general confu&s;ion. He raved in agonies of grief, and offered half his fortune to any one, who would ri&s;k his life to &s;ave his child. As he was known to be very rich, &s;e|veral ladders were in&s;tantly rai&s;ed by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to obtain the reward; but the violence of the flames drove every one down who attempted it.</P>
<P>The unfortunate youth then appeared on the top of the hou&s;e, extending his arms, and calling out for aid. The unhappy father became motionle&s;s, and remained in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. At this critical moment, a man ru&s;hed through the crowd, and a&s;cended the tal|le&s;t ladder, &s;eemingly determined to re&s;cue the youth, or peri&s;h in the attempt. A &s;udden gu&s;t of flame bur&s;ting forth, led the people to &s;uppo&s;e he was lo&s;t; but he pre&s;ently appeared de&s;cending the ladder with the child in his arms, without receiving any material injury. An univer&s;al &s;hout attended this noble action, and the father, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;upri&s;e, on recover|ing from his &s;woon, found his child in his arms.</P>
<P>After giving vent to the fir&s;t emotions of tenderne&s;s, he enquired after his generous deliverer, who&s;e features were &s;o changed by the &s;moke, that they could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed. Franci&s;co immediately pre&s;ented him
<PB N="238" REF="246">with a pur&s;e of gold, promi&s;ing the next day to give him the reward he offered. The &s;tranger replied, that he &s;hould accept of no reward. Franci&s;co &s;tarted, and thought he knew the voice, when his &s;on flew to the arms of his deliverer, and cried out, "It is my dear Hamet! it is my dear Hamet!"</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment and gratitude of the merchant were equally excited, and, retiring from the crowd, he took Hamet with him to a friend's hou&s;e. As &s;oon as they were alone, Franci&s;co enquired by what means he had been a &s;econd time en&s;laved.</P>
<P>"I will tell you in a few words," &s;aid the generous Turk. "When I was taken by the Venetian gallies, my father &s;hared in my captivity. It was his fate, and not my own, which &s;o often made me &s;hed tho&s;e tears, which fir&s;t attracted the notice of your amiable &s;on.&mdash;As &s;oon as your bounty had &s;et me free, I flew to the Chri&s;tian who had purcha&s;ed my father. I told him, that as I was young and vigorous, and he aged and in|firm, I would be his &s;lave in&s;tead of my father. I add|ed, too, the gold which your bounty had be&s;towed on me, and by the&s;e means I prevailed on the Chri&s;tian to &s;end back my father in that &s;hip you had provided for me, without his knowing the cau&s;e of his freedom.&mdash;Since that time I have &s;taid here a willing &s;lave, and Heaven has been &s;o gracious as to put it into my pow|er to &s;ave the life of that youth, which I value a thou|&s;and times more than my own."</P>
<P>The merchant was a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch an in&s;tance of gratitude and affection, and pre&s;&s;ed Hamet to accept of the half of his fortune, and to &s;ettle in Venice for the remainder of his days. Hamet, however, with a noble magnanimity, refu&s;ed the offer, &s;aying, he had done no more than what every one ought to do in a &s;imilar &s;itu|ation. Though Hamet &s;eemed to under-rate his pa&s;t &s;ervices to the merchant, yet the latter could not &s;uffer things to pa&s;s in this manner. He again purcha&s;ed his freedom, and fitted and &s;hip out on purpo&s;e to take him back to his own country. At parting, they mutually
<PB N="239" REF="247">embraced each other, and, as they thought, took an e|ternal farewel.</P>
<P>After many years had elap&s;ed, and young Franci&s;co was grown up to manhood, beloved and re&s;pected by every one, it &s;o happened, that &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s made it nece&s;&s;ary for him and his father to vi&s;it a neighbouring city on the coa&s;t, and as they &s;uppo&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea would be more expeditious than by land, they em|barked in a Venetian ve&s;&s;el, which was bound to that port, and ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>A favourable gale &s;oon wafted them out of &s;ight, and promi&s;ed them a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age; but unfortunately for them, before they had proceeded half their voyage, they were met by &s;ome Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els, who, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance from the Venetians, boarded them, loaded them with irons, and carried them pri&s;oners to Tunis. There they were expo&s;ed in the market-place in their chains, in order to be &s;old as &s;laves.</P>
<P>At la&s;t a Turk came to the market who &s;eemed to be a man of &s;uperior rank, and after looking over the pri|&s;oners, with an expre&s;&s;ion of compa&s;&s;ion, he fixed his eyes upon young Franci&s;co, and a&s;ked the captain what was the price of that young captive. The captain re|plied, that he would not part with him for le&s;s than five hundred pieces of gold. The Turk con&s;idered that as a very extraordinary price, &s;ince he had &s;een him &s;ell others, that exceeded him in &s;trength and vi|gour, for le&s;s than a fifth part of that money.</P>
<P>"That is true," replied the captain, "but he &s;hall either fetch me a price that will repay me the damage he has occa&s;ioned me, or he &s;hall labour all the re&s;t of his life at the oar." The Turk a&s;ked him, what da|mage he could have done him more than the re&s;t of the crew. "It was he," replied the captain, "who ani|mated the Chri&s;tians to make a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, and thereby proved the de&s;truction of many of my bra|ve&s;t &s;eamen. We three times boarded them with a fury that &s;eemed invincible, and each time did that youth attack us with a cool and determined oppo&s;ition;
<PB N="240" REF="248">&s;o that we were obliged to give up the conte&s;t, till other &s;hips came up to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I will therefore have that price for him, or I will puni&s;h him for life."</P>
<P>The Turk now &s;urveyed young Franci&s;co more at|tentively than before; and the young man, who had hitherto fixed his eyes in &s;ullen &s;ilence on the ground, at length rai&s;ed them up; but he had no &s;ooner beheld the per&s;on who was talking to the captain, than, in a loud voice, he uttered the name of Hamet. The Turk, &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;urveyed him for a moment, and then caught him in his arms.</P>
<P>After a moment's pau&s;e, the generous Hamet lifted up his hands to Heaven, and thanked his God, who had put it in his power to &s;hew his gratitude; but words cannot expre&s;s his feelings, when he found that both father and &s;on were &s;laves. Suffice it to &s;ay, that he in&s;tantly bought their freedom, and conducted them to his magnificent hou&s;e in the city.</P>
<P>They had here full lei&s;ure to di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, when Hamet told his Venetian friends, that after their genero&s;ity had procured him liberty, he became an officer in the Turki&s;h army, and happening to be fortunate in all his enterpri&s;es, he had been gradually promoted, till he arrived at the dignity of ba&s;haw of Tunis. That in this &s;ituation, he found the greate&s;t con&s;olation in alleviating the misfortunes of the Chri&s;tian pri&s;oners, and always attended the &s;ales of tho&s;e unhappy &s;laves, to procure liberty to a certain number of them. "And gracious Allah," added he, "has this day put it in my power, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to return the duties of gratitude."</P>
<P>They continued &s;ome days with Hamet, who did every thing in his power to amu&s;e and divert them; but as he found their de&s;ire was to return to their own country, he told them, that he would not wi&s;h to de|tain them again&s;t their wi&s;hes, and that they &s;hould embark the next day in a &s;hip bound for Venice, which would be furni&s;hed with a pa&s;&s;port to carry them &s;afe there.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="249">The next day he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with every mark of tenderne&s;s and affection, and ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> party of his own guards to attend them to the ve&s;&s;el. They had no &s;ooner got on board, than they found, to their inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e and joy, that they were in the very &s;hip in which they had been taken, and that, by the genero&s;ity of Hamet, not only the &s;hip, but even the whole crew, were redeemed and re&s;tored to freedom. Franci&s;co and his &s;on, after a quick pa&s;&s;age, arrived in their own country, where they lived beloved and re|&s;pected, and endeavoured to convince every one they knew, how great were the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and that God never &s;uffers humanity and genero&s;ity to go unrewarded, here or hereafter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> HISTORY <HI>of the</HI> EMPRESS CATHERINA.</HEAD>
<P>CATHERINA Alexowna, born near Derpat, a lit|tle city in Livonia, was heir to no other inheri|tance than the virtues and frugality of her parents.&mdash;Her father being dead, &s;he lived with her aged mother, in their cottage covered with &s;traw; and both, though very poor, were very contented. Here, retired from the gaze of the world, by the labour of her hands, &s;he &s;upported her parent, who was now incapable of &s;up|porting her&s;elf. While Catherina &s;pun, the old wo|man would &s;it by, and read &s;ome book of devotion; thus when the fatigues of the day were over, both would &s;it down contentedly by their fire&s;ide, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>Though her face and per&s;on were models of perfec|tion, yet her whole attention &s;eemed be&s;towed upon her mind; her mother taught her to read, and an old Lutheran mini&s;ter in&s;tructed her in the maxims and duties of religion. Nature had furni&s;hed her not only
<PB N="242" REF="250">with a ready, but a &s;olid, turn of thought; not only with a &s;trong, but a right, under&s;tanding. Such truly female accompli&s;hments procured her &s;everal &s;olicita|tions of marriage from the pea&s;ants of the country; but their offers were refu&s;ed; for &s;he loved her mother too tenderly to think of a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Catherina was fifteen when her mother died; &s;he now therefore left her cottage, and went to live with the Lutheran mini&s;ter, by whom &s;he had been in&s;truct|ed from her childhood. In his hou&s;e &s;he re&s;ided in quality of governe&s;s to his children; at once reconci|ling in her character unerring prudence with &s;urpri&s;ing vivacity.</P>
<P>The old man, who regarded her as one of his own children, had her in&s;tructed in dancing and mu&s;ic by the ma&s;ters who attended the re&s;t of his family; thus &s;he continued to improve till he died, by which acci|dent &s;he was once more reduced to pri&s;tine poverty.&mdash;The country of Livonia was at this time wa&s;ted by war, and lay in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate of de&s;olation. Tho&s;e calamities are ever mo&s;t heavy upon the poor; where|fore Catherina, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many accompli&s;h|ments, experienced all the mi&s;eries of hopele&s;s indi|gence. Provi&s;ions becoming every day more &s;carce, and her private &s;tock being entirely exhau&s;ted, &s;he re|&s;olved at la&s;t to travel to Marienburgh, a city of greater plenty.</P>
<P>With her &s;canty wardrobe, packed up in a wallet, &s;he &s;et out on her journey on foot: She was to walk through a region mi&s;erable by nature, but rendered &s;till more hideous by the Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians, who, as each happened to become ma&s;ters, plundered it at di&s;|cretion: But hunger had taught her to de&s;pi&s;e the dan|gers and fatigues of the way.</P>
<P>One evening, upon her journey, as &s;he had entered a cottage by the way &s;ide, to take up her lodging for the night, &s;he was in&s;ulted by two Swedi&s;h &s;oldiers, who in&s;i&s;ted upon qualifying her, as they termed it, <HI>to follow the camp.</HI> They might, probably, have carried
<PB N="243" REF="251">their in&s;ults into violence, had not a &s;ubaltern officer, accidentally pa&s;&s;ing by, come in to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Up|on his appearing, the &s;oldiers immediately de&s;i&s;ted; but her thankfulne&s;s was hardly greater than her &s;ur|pri&s;e, when &s;he in&s;tantly recollected in her deliverer, the &s;on of the Lutheran mini&s;ter, her former in&s;truct|or, benefactor, and friend.</P>
<P>This was an happy interview for Catherina: The little &s;tock of money &s;he had brought from home was, by this time, quite exhau&s;ted; her cloaths were gone, piece by piece, in order to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who had enter|tained her in their hou&s;es; her generous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could &s;pare, to buy her cloaths, furni&s;hed her with an hor&s;e, and gave her let|ters of recommendation to Mr Gluck, a faithful friend of his father's, and Superintendant of Marienburgh.</P>
<P>Our beautiful &s;tranger had only to appear to be well received; &s;he was immediately admitted into the Su|perintendant's family as governe&s;s to his two daughters; and though yet but &s;eventeen, &s;hewed her&s;elf capable of in&s;tructing her &s;ex, not only in virtue, but politene&s;s. Such was her good &s;en&s;e and beauty, that her ma&s;ter him&s;elf in a &s;hort time offered her his hand, which, to his great &s;urprize, &s;he thought proper to refu&s;e. Ac|tuated by a principle of gratitude, &s;he was re&s;olved to marry her deliverer only, even though he had lo&s;t an arm, and was otherwi&s;e disfigured by wounds in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent further &s;olicitations from others, as &s;oon as the officer came to town upon duty, &s;he offered him her per&s;on which he accepted with tran&s;port, and their nuptials were &s;olemnized as u&s;ual. But all the lines of her fortune were to be &s;tri|king: The very day on which they were married, the Ru&s;&s;ians laid &s;iege to Marienburgh; the unhappy &s;ol|dier had now no time to enjoy the well-earned plea&s;ures of matrimony; he was called off before con&s;ummation to an attack, from which he was never after &s;een to return.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="252">In the mean time the &s;iege went on with fury, ag|gravated on one &s;ide by ob&s;tinacy, on the other by re|venge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous: The innocent pea|&s;ant and the harmle&s;s virgin often &s;hared the fate of the &s;oldier in arms. Marienburgh was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and &s;uch was the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants, that not only the garri&s;on, but almo&s;t all the inhabitants, men, wo|men, and children, were put to the &s;word; at length when the carnage was pretty well over, Catherina was found hid in an oven.</P>
<P>She had been hitherto poor, but &s;till was free; &s;he was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a &s;lave: In this &s;ituation, however, &s;he be|haved with piety and humility; and though misfor|tunes had abated her vivacity, yet &s;he was chearful.&mdash;The &s;ame of her merit and re&s;ignation reached even Prince Menzikoff, the Ru&s;&s;ian General; he de&s;ired to &s;ee her, was &s;truck with her beauty, bought her from the &s;oldier, her ma&s;ter, and placed her under the direc|tion of his own &s;i&s;ter. Here &s;he was treated with all the re&s;pect which her merit de&s;erved, while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this &s;ituation, when Peter the Great paying the prince a vi&s;it, Catherina happened to come in with &s;ome dry fruits, which &s;he &s;erved round with peculiar mode&s;ty. The mighty monarch &s;aw, and was &s;truck with her beauty&punc; He returned the next day, called for the beautiful &s;lave, a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions, and found her under&s;tanding even more perfect than her per&s;on.</P>
<P>He had been forced, when young, to marry from motives of intere&s;t, he was now re&s;olved to marry pur|&s;uant to his own inclinations. He immediately enquir|ed the hi&s;tory of the fair Livonian, who was not yet eighteen. He traced her through the vale of ob&s;curity, through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of her fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanne&s;s of her birth was no ob&s;truction to his de&s;ign; their nuptials
<PB N="245" REF="253">were &s;olemnized in private: The prince a&s;&s;uring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the propere&s;t ladder to a throne.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee Catherina, from the low mud walled cottage, empre&s;s of the greate&s;t kingdom upon earth. The poor &s;olitary wanderer is now &s;urrounded by thou|&s;ands, who find happine&s;s in her &s;mile. She, who for|merly wanted a meal, is now capable of diffu&s;ing plen|ty upon whole nations. To her fortune &s;he owed a part of this pre-eminence, but to her virtues more.</P>
<P>She ever after retained tho&s;e great qualities which fir&s;t placed her on a throne; and while the extraordi|nary prince, her hu&s;band, laboured for the reformation of his male &s;ubjects, &s;he &s;tudied in her turn the im|provement of her own &s;ex. She altered their dre&s;&s;es, introduced mixed a&s;&s;emblies, in&s;tituted an order of fe|male knighthood, and, at length, when &s;he had great|ly filled all the &s;tations of empre&s;s, friend, wife, and mother, bravely died without regret;&mdash;regretted by all.</P>

<HEAD>FILIAL AFFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>CINNA, the Roman Con&s;ul, who &s;crupled no at|tempt, how villainous &s;oever, which could &s;erve his purpo&s;e, undertook to get Pomponius Strabo mur|dered in his tent; but his &s;on &s;aved his life, which was the fir&s;t remarkable action of Pompey the Great. The treacherous Cinna, by many alluring promi&s;es, had gained over one Terentius, a confidante of Pompey's, to his intere&s;t, and prevailed on him to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the general, and &s;educe his troops. Young Pompey being informed of this de&s;ign a few hours before it was to be put in execution, placed a faithful guard round the praetorium; &s;o that none of the con&s;pirators could come near it. He then watched all the motions of the
<PB N="246" REF="254">camp, and endeavoured to appea&s;e the fury of the &s;ol|diers, who hated the general his father, by &s;uch acts of prudence as were worthy of the olde&s;t commanders. However, &s;ome of the mutineers having forced open one of the gates of the camp, in order to de&s;ert to Cinna, the general's &s;on threw him&s;elf flat on his back in their way, crying out, that they &s;hould not break their oath, and de&s;ert their commander, without tread|ing his body to death. By this means he put a &s;top to their de&s;ertion, and afterwards wrought &s;o effectually upon them by his affecting &s;peeches and engaging car|riage, that he reconciled them to his father.</P>

<LG>
<L>Virtue, the &s;trength and beauty of the &s;oul,</L>

<L>That ne'er encumbers, nor to ba&s;er hands</L>
<L>Can be transferr'd: It is the only good</L>

<L>Are riches worth your care (for Nature's wants</L>
<L>Are few, and without opulence &s;upplied)</L>
<L>This noble end is to produce the Soul:</L>
<L>To &s;hew the virtues in their faire&s;t light;</L>
<L>To make Humanity the Mini&s;ter</L>
