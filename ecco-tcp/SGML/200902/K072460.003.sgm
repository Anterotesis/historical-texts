<HEAD>ROBIN.</HEAD>
<P>ROBIN was about &s;ix years of age. He was not wicked, but his mother let him always have his way; and then his father was afraid that the poor child might cry his eyes out, if he wanted any thing, and &s;hould not get it. Being thus indulged, his whims grew every day more frequent, and they could not always be gratified; for his parents were extremely poor, and li|ved, as the expre&s;&s;ion is, from hand to mouth. He grew at la&s;t quite ob&s;tinate and quarrel&s;ome, in&s;i&s;ted upon hav|ing every thing that he &s;aw, and when he could not get it, would grow &s;ulky, tear his cloaths to &s;how his &s;pite, do nothing that he was bid to do, and often quite the contrary.</P>
<P>His parents were much grieved to &s;ee this behaviour in him, and judged it to proceed from a heart naturally perver&s;e. Alas! cried his mother, I once hoped that our little Robin would in time con&s;ole us under all our griefs, be the joy of our old age, and work for our &s;up|port, when we were pa&s;t our &s;trength, reflecting that we had done &s;o much to feed and bring him up: but, on the contrary, he is our greate&s;t unhappine&s;s. His prin|ciples are quite corrupt, &s;aid the father; every one will hate him utterly, and not a &s;oul a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his need. He will commit &s;ome wicked action, and be puni&s;hed for it by his country. He will live in &s;hame and mi&s;ery. God grant I may be dead before this comes to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e mortifying thoughts would con&s;tantly be upper|mo&s;t within them. They were now no longer cheerful at their daily toil, and had no appetite for their meals. Their &s;orrow had a vi&s;ible effect upon their health; their &s;trength &s;oon failed them; and one morning, being more
<PB N="2" REF="8">depre&s;&s;ed than u&s;ual, they had not &s;ufficient &s;pirits to get up. Not &s;o the little Robin: he was up as u&s;ual, and called for his breakfa&s;t. Robin, &s;aid his mother, I am very ill, and cannot ri&s;e to get it for you. On which he &s;ulked, &s;he wept, and Hutchin&s;on his father &s;ighed. The little urchin waited yet &s;ome time; but &s;eeing neither of them &s;tir, re&s;olved in&s;tantly what to do. He went to a neighbour's hou&s;e for a light, as he de&s;igned to make a fire. A little girl came down to let him in; and &s;eeing Robin, a&s;ked him what he wanted, with a tone of voice that &s;eemed to &s;ay he was not welcome; for &s;he did not like him in the lea&s;t. I want to light my candle, an&s;wer|ed Robin, Well, do &s;o, returned the little girl, as I have let you in: but do not come here again. This way of talking Robin did not much like. He was very ea&s;ily offended; &s;o he went away and did not even light his candle.</P>
<P>After this he vi&s;ited another neighbour, who came down; but &s;eeing Robin through the ca&s;ement, he would not &s;o much as a&s;k him what he wanted, but went up again. Refu&s;ed admittance every where, he came home, put down the candle, and bethought him&s;elf of going to a good old woman's, who formerly u&s;ed to treat him with &s;weet things. He went and a&s;ked her for &s;ome break|fa&s;t. Breakfa&s;t! an&s;wered Frances: why has not your mother let you have &s;ome? She is a-bed, &s;aid Robin. Well, your father then? He likewi&s;e is a-bed. They &s;ay, they are ill. And would you leave them then, and come to me for victuals? Get you gone! I have nothing for you. Had I more than what I want my&s;elf, I would give it to poor children who are fonder of their parents than you are, and make them happy, whereas you every day torment yours.</P>
<P>Robin came away in tears, and walked home very &s;lowly. In the way, he recollected that he him&s;elf had frequently &s;hammed illne&s;s; and &s;uppo&s;ed it not im|po&s;&s;ible that his parents might now be doing the &s;ame. For certainty, he got upon a little chair, held back the curtain, and beheld how pale they were. He &s;aw that they had been crying too. This &s;ight affected him. He put the curtains to again, &s;at down be&s;ide the bed, and held his hands up to his face. Unhappy that I am!
<PB N="3" REF="9">&s;aid he, &s;uppo&s;e my parents were to die, what would become of me? I am refu&s;ed admittance every where, and cannot obtain a bit of bread. I mu&s;t then have been very wicked! my poor mother! how you have at all times loved me! and how have I grieved you! And my father, my dear father&mdash;Who can tell, alas! but they will die?</P>
<P>He &s;at a little longer thinking; and returning after|wards to the hou&s;e where he had been refu&s;ed entrance at fir&s;t, begged for heaven's &s;ake that they would let him have a little bread and milk, to make a breakfa&s;t for his parents. His affliction and the humble tone of voice with which he now addre&s;&s;ed them, ea&s;ily gained him a hearing. Look ye, &s;aid the good man of the cottage, &s;ince you a&s;k me thus, I will not refu&s;e you. Take the half of this brown loaf, with &s;ome of this milk, and warm it for your parents. It is but ju&s;t that you &s;hould prepare their breakfa&s;t, while they are both work|ing &s;o hard for you. He dur&s;t not mention that they were ill, becau&s;e he feared the &s;ame reproaches which Frances had be&s;towed upon him, though he merited them now much le&s;s: on which account his charitable bene|factor did not go him&s;elf to &s;ee them; as he would have done, had he but known their &s;ituation, for he e&s;teemed them greatly.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Robin brought away the bread and milk, came home, made up a fire, and putting on a pipkin, boiled the milk. It was no &s;ooner ready, than he drew a little table towards the bed. His mother heard him move about the chamber. What can Robin be doing? &s;aid his mother. Nothing good, I fear, an&s;wer|ed Hutchin&s;on. She wi&s;hed to know, endeavoured to &s;it up in bed; and looking through the curtains, which were very flim&s;y, &s;aw the little table with two porringers, and Robin, who was cutting bread into them. Upon this, &s;he jogged her hu&s;band. See, &s;aid &s;he, I verily be|lieve he is doing this for us; el&s;e, why two porringers up|on the table? Would to God, &s;aid Hutchin&s;on, he were! I am not hungry, but &s;hould like to be convinced that he is better than we have thought him.</P>
<P>Robin, with his pipkin came at la&s;t; and filling both the porringers approached his parents. Hold, &s;aid he,
<PB N="4" REF="10">dear father; hold dear mother.&mdash;Here's &s;ome breakfa&s;t for you both.&mdash;And is it you that prepared it? &s;aid the father. Who could give you all this bread and milk? It was neighbour &s;uch-a-one, an&s;wered he. The father and the mother bade him put down both the porringers again. Their eyes grew bright with joy. Dear child! come hither, cried they. You are not what we thought you to be; you bring both of us to life again. So &s;aying, they held out their arms: he bent to their em|brace; he wept, as they did likewi&s;e; he de&s;ired for|givene&s;s for the grief which he had occa&s;ioned them; and promi&s;ed that they &s;hould henceforth be rejoiced by his behaviour.</P>
<P>He was &s;till in their arms, when Frances entered with her breakfa&s;t in her hand; which &s;he brought, in order to &s;hare it with her indi&s;po&s;ed good neigh|bours. She was moved at &s;uch a piteous &s;ight, &s;hed tears of joy, and ble&s;&s;ed the little Robin, who, on-his &s;ide, tenderly embraced her al&s;o. They all breakfa&s;ted together, and had never in their lives before enjoyed &s;o &s;weet a meal.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of &s;uch a day &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed this good father, and this loving mother, in their former &s;tate of health. The little boy al&s;o became very happy. He acquired the love of every one that knew him, was care&s;&s;ed with ju&s;tice by his parents and the charita|ble Frances, who rejoiced to do them all the good in her power.</P>

<HEAD>AMELIA.</HEAD>
<P>AMELIA when &s;carcely &s;ix years old, was very fond of her mamma, and wi&s;hed continually to be with her. On a certain day, Amelia's mother wi&s;hed to go to market, and the little girl entreated to accom|pany her thither. You will only be trouble&s;ome to me, child, &s;aid &s;he. No, no; I hope, I &s;hall not be trouble&s;ome to you, &s;aid Amelia; and pre&s;&s;ed &s;o much that her mama at la&s;t con&s;ented to give her leave.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">They &s;et out, therefore, both together. As it chanced, their hou&s;e was in the country, and the paths proved very bad. Amelia frequently was forced to walk behind her mother, when the ruts would not permit them to have hold of one another. They were now come very near the town; and as it chanced, the road was crouded with a multitude of people pa&s;&s;ing every way. The little girl was often &s;eparated from her mother; but this gave her no un|ea&s;ine&s;s, as after two or three &s;uch accidents, &s;he had rejoined her with ea&s;e, but the nearer they approached the market, the more &s;he perceived the crowd to augment. This &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily have made her watchful of the way that her mother went; and yet, a &s;ort of puppet-&s;how which was exhibiting, had charms &s;ufficient to detain her. She &s;topped &s;hort to gaze at Punchinello. In the mid&s;t, how|ever, of her entertainment, &s;he turned round, but could not &s;ee her mother; &s;he ran on, called out, and &s;crambling up a bank, at once looked over all the people's heads: but it was in vain. She could not &s;ee her, could not hear her voice; and now the little maiden, being frightened, dur&s;t not mix among &s;o great a crowd, that jo&s;tled one another. So &s;he got into a corner, called out mammy! mammy! and bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>The people that went by, looked at her. <HI>There is a little girl,</HI> &s;aid one among them, <HI>in a piteous taking! What is the matter with you?</HI> a&s;ked another. <HI>I have lo&s;t my mammy! Oh, never mind it;</HI> an&s;wered he. <HI>You will find her cut again, I warrant you.</HI> A third &s;aid, <HI>Do not cry, my little girl. She will not come to you the &s;ooner for that.</HI> Thus &s;aid many, and they all went on about their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>By good luck, at la&s;t, however, an old woman who &s;old eggs and butter, and was lame and therefore could not walk without a crutch, was going by, but &s;eeing her in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, &s;topped &s;hort and pitied her. <HI>And which way was your mother going, little dear,</HI> &s;aid the woman, <HI>when you lo&s;t her? She was going to the market,</HI> &s;aid Amelia. <HI>Well, be comforted,</HI> replied the fir&s;t; <HI>and come along with me. I will take you to the market. You will find her there, no doubt.</HI> Amelia gave her hand, that moment, to the good old woman, and &s;oon reached the market. As they en|tered, &s;he perceived her mother, gave a cry of joy, and up her mother came immediately. She took the little girl into her arms, and &s;aid, You frightened me exceedingly,
<PB N="6" REF="12">my dear, by wandering from me: and the child, that mo|ment, fell a hugging her, and cried.</P>
<P>She told her of the puppet-&s;how, and that &s;he had &s;topped to look at it; how &s;he called out after her, and how the good old market-woman, and &s;he only, had taken pity of her and brought her through the crowd. Amelia's mother thanked her, bought what eggs and butter &s;he had left, and gave her more than &s;he a&s;ked. Amelia ki&s;&s;ed her ten times over; and while going home, would talk of nothing but the good old market-woman.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t fine weather came, Amelia begged her mother to go &s;ee Dame Dunch, which was the market-woman's name: and &s;he con&s;ented, took a loaf of bread, and half a pound of tea, with &s;ugar in proportion. Dame Dunch's dwelling was a wooden one: it was not large, but very clean and comfortable. In the front, there was a little gra&s;s-plat, &s;haded on every &s;ide by fruit trees; upon which, Amelia danced till evening with a niece of the Dame's who was as kind and good natured as her aunt.</P>
<P>Amelia's mother always bought Dame Dunch's eggs and butter, but complained that &s;he rated them at too low a price; while Dame Dunch would have it that &s;he was paid too much. Amelia and her mother gave the good old woman all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power; and when in <HI>her</HI> turn the old woman could be &s;erviceable to Amelia or her mother, &s;he would put on her cloth apron, take her crutch, and come quite out of breath, but very joyous.</P>
<P>Thus they did each other mutual &s;ervice: but the good old woman had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to rejoice, that &s;he had taken pity on a little girl in trouble. In the act of helping her, &s;he did not think that her good heart would gain her &s;uch a world of happy hours.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect, la&s;t year, how all mama's acquaintance brought us play-things and &s;weet-meats. We had really &s;o much, we knew not where to put them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were &s;pread upon a large &s;quare table, and mama came out to call us with her charming voice. Come, come, &s;aid &s;he, and take the&s;e pre&s;ents. She em|braced us, and &s;hed tears. I never &s;aw her half &s;o happy as that day, when &s;he beheld us jump about the room for joy.</P>

<P>One would have thought that &s;he had received the Chri&s;tmas-boxes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>There mu&s;t con&s;equently be a plea&s;ure, I &s;up|po&s;e, in giving: &s;o I will tell you what we ought to do, Letitia. We are very little, and of cour&s;e have little that we can give. But &s;till we have it in our power to get this plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, pray, Letitia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it wants a fortnight now, you know, of Chri&s;tmas Monday: and we both have money in our pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I have upwards of a crown. What &s;hall we do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You recollect, our fair comes on to-morrow. Well then, we mu&s;t get up early, and work hard, and &s;tudy diligently, and do every part of our bu&s;ine&s;s well, that in the afternoon we may have leave to go and &s;ee the
<PB N="8" REF="14">fair. Now I have more a good deal than nine &s;hillings. We will each take half our money, and go buy the pret|tie&s;t things that we can &s;ee. We will bring them home all cleverly wrapped up, and early upon Chri&s;tmas Mon|day, give them to our gardener's children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but then, Letitia, the poor woman's children, who comes here to work occa&s;ionally, mu&s;t have &s;omething likewi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right; I did not think of them. O, how de|lighted they will be! I fancy the poor little children, in their joy, will &s;ay that they never had a Chri&s;tmas-box before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that ca&s;e, we &s;hall be the fir&s;t to cau&s;e them &s;uch a deal of plea&s;ure.&mdash;O, my dear, dear &s;i&s;ter! I mu&s;t hug you for that thought!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but &s;tay a little. I have another in my head. This money which we de&s;ign to &s;pend&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is ours; and we may lay it out as we think proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is true. But&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had it from mama, you know; it was her pre&s;ent to us, as in general all our money is. Now &s;i&s;ter, if we lay this money out in pre&s;ents for the chil|dren, it will then be mama that has made the&s;e pre&s;ents, and not we.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true indeed; and yet we have no other money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We can, notwith&s;tanding, hit on &s;ome expe|dient for the purpo&s;e, I dare &s;ay. For in the fir&s;t place, I can work indifferently at my needle, and you knit with tolerable ea&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what u&s;e will this be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will not be long before you have knit a pair of garters for papa; and I have been this fortnight at a pair of ruffles, which he does not know. What then hinders, pray, but we may fini&s;h the&s;e two articles a day or two on this &s;ide Chri&s;tmas Monday?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and if we do, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then we can pre&s;ent the garters and the rurfles to papa, who will be glad to buy them of us, and pay thrice as much as they are worth.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>ABEL.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Abel was &s;carce turned of eight years old, when he had the misfortune to lo&s;e his mother. It afflicted him &s;o much, that nothing could re&s;tore him to the gaiety &s;o natural to young children. Mrs. Donald&s;on, his aunt, was forced to take him to her hou&s;e, for fear his &s;adne&s;s &s;hould &s;till aggravate her brother's incon&s;olable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>They went, however, frequently to &s;ee him; and at la&s;t, the time was come for going out of mourning. Abel therefore quitted his; and, though his heart was full of &s;orrow, he endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a lively counte|nance. His father was affected at this &s;en&s;ibility: but alas! it only occa&s;ioned him more &s;orrow, by cau&s;ing him to reflect that he had for ever lo&s;t the mother of this amiable child; and this reflexion, every one remarked, was bringing him with &s;orrow to the grave.</P>
<P>It was a fortnight now, &s;ince Abel had been to &s;ee him as u&s;ual. His aunt always urged &s;ome pretext or other during that time, as often as he wi&s;hed to go. The truth
<PB N="10" REF="16">is, Mr. Donald&s;on was dangerou&s;ly ill. He dur&s;t not a&s;k to &s;ee his child, from apprehen&s;ion that the &s;ight of his condition might too much affect him. The&s;e paternal &s;truggles, joined with the former depre&s;&s;ion of his &s;pirits, &s;o exhau&s;ted him, that very &s;oon there was no hope re|maining of his cure. He died, in fact, upon the day before his birth-day.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Abel, having waked betimes, tor|mented Mrs. Donald&s;on &s;o much for leave to go and wi&s;h his father joy, that &s;he at la&s;t con&s;ented; but he &s;aw his mourning was now to go on again.</P>
<P>And why this ugly black, &s;aid he, to-day, when we are going to papa?&mdash;Who is dead now, aunt?</P>
<P>His aunt was &s;o afflicted, that &s;he could not &s;peak a word.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid Abel, if you will not tell me, I will enquire of my papa.</P>
<P>At this &s;he could no longer refrain from weeping, but bur&s;t out into a flood of tears, and &s;aid, It is he, it is he him&s;elf that is dead.</P>
<P>What, my papa dead! an&s;wered he. O heaven! take pity on me. My mama fir&s;t dead! and now papa! Un|happy as I am, and parentle&s;s! what will become of me? O my papa! mama!</P>
<P>The&s;e words were &s;carcely uttered, when he fell into a &s;woon; nor could his aunt, without much difficulty, bring him to him&s;elf again.</P>
<P>Poor child, &s;aid &s;he, do not be thus afflicted. Your parents are &s;till living.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Donald&s;on.</SPEAKER>
<P>In heaven, with God. They are both happy in that place; and will at all times have an eye upon their child. If you are prudent, diligent, and up|right, they will pray that God may ble&s;s you; and God certainly <HI>will</HI> ble&s;s you. This was the la&s;t prayer that your father uttered ye&s;terday, when dying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye&s;terday! when I was thinking of the plea&s;ure that I &s;hould have in &s;eeing him this morning.&mdash;Ye&s;terday! Then he is not buried yet? O aunt, pray let me &s;ee him! He would not &s;end for me, fearing to afflict me; and perhaps I, on the contrary, &s;hould have afflicted him. But now, as I cannot po&s;&s;ibly give him any pain, I would
<PB N="11" REF="17">once more behold him, for the la&s;t, la&s;t time! Pray let me go and &s;ee him, my dear aunt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Donald&s;on.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, we will go together, if you promi&s;e to be calm. You &s;ee my tears, and how much I am grieved for having lo&s;t my brother. He was always doing me &s;ome good or other: I was poor, and had no maintenance but what his bounty gave me. Notwith|&s;tanding which, I yield my&s;elf, you &s;ee, to Providence that watches over us. Be calm, then, my dear child!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I mu&s;t indeed be calm. But pray, aunt, carry me to my papa, that I may &s;ee at lea&s;t his coffin.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mrs. Donald&s;on then took him by the hand and in|&s;tantly went out: the day was very dark and even foggy. Abel wept as he went on.</P>
<P>When they were come before the hou&s;e, the mutes were at the door, and Mr. Donald&s;on's late friends and neigh|bours were &s;tanding round his coffin. They wept bitterly, and prai&s;ed the integrity of the decea&s;ed. Little Abel ru&s;hed into the hou&s;e, and threw him&s;elf upon the coffin. For &s;ome time he could not &s;peak a word; but at la&s;t rai&s;ed his head a little, crying out, See how your little Abel weeps for having lo&s;t you! When mama died, you con&s;oled me, and yet wept your&s;elf; but now, who will con&s;ole me for your lo&s;s! Oh! my papa! my good papa!</P>
<P>He could utter no more: his &s;orrow almo&s;t &s;trangled him. His mouth was open, and his tongue &s;eemed mo|tionle&s;s. His eyes at one time fixed; and at another, rolling in their &s;ockets, had no tears to &s;hed. His aunt had need of all her &s;trength to pluck him from the coffin. She conducted him to a neighbour's hou&s;e, begging her to keep him till his father's burial was over; for &s;he dur&s;t not think of carrying him to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon the bell was &s;et a tolling. Abel heard it; and the woman to who&s;e care he had been tru&s;ted having quitted the apartment for a moment, he availed him&s;elf of the opportunity, got out, and ran that in&s;tant to the church-yard, whither the funeral was gone. The mi|ni&s;ter had fini&s;hed, and the grave was filling up;&mdash;when, all at once, a cry was heard of, <HI>Bury me with my papa!</HI> and Abel jumped into the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">The mourners were affected at it: Abel was drawn out all pale and &s;peechle&s;s, and, in &s;pite of his re&s;i&s;tance, carried home.</P>
<P>He was for upwards of three days continually fainting; and his aunt could not bring him to be compo&s;ed, even at intervals, except by &s;peaking to him of his dear papa. At length his fir&s;t exce&s;s of angui&s;h was allayed: he wept no longer, but was very &s;orrowful.</P>
<P>A worthy merchant heard of this deplorable affair. He had not been without &s;ome knowledge of the father; therefore he repaired to Mrs. Donald&s;on, that he might &s;ee the little orphan. He was very much affected at his &s;adne&s;s, took him home and was a father to him. Abel &s;oon con&s;idered him&s;elf as really the merchant's &s;on, and every day gained greater ground in his affection. At the age of twenty, he conducted all the bu&s;ine&s;s of his bene|factor with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that in reality the merchant thought it his duty to a&s;&s;ign him half the profits of it for the future; to which recompen&s;e he added his beloved daughter.&mdash;Abel hitherto had maintained his aunt out of the little perqui&s;ites belonging to him; and, by this event, he had the further happine&s;s of making her quite ea&s;y for the remnant of her days. But never did his father's birth-day come about, but he was &s;eized in &s;ome &s;ort with a fever, on recalling to his memory what he once had &s;uffered at that &s;ea&s;on; and to tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations which then affected him did he impute the principles of honour and integrity that he ever afterwards cultivated during the whole of a long life.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMPLIMENT OF THE NEW YEAR.</HEAD>
<P>UPON a certain new-year's day, little Peregrine came into the parlour, ju&s;t before breakfa&s;t was ready. He advanced, and with the greate&s;t gravity &s;a|luting his papa, began as follows, in a &s;olemn tone of voice:</P>
<P>"As formerly the Romans were accu&s;tomed every new-year's day to wi&s;h their friends all happine&s;s; &s;o <HI>I,</HI> thrice honoured father, come&mdash;So <HI>I,</HI> thrice honoured father, come&mdash;come&mdash;come&mdash;"</P>
<P>The little orator at this &s;topped &s;hort. It was in vain; he fretted, rubbed his forehead, and began to fumble in his pocket. The remainder of this excellent harangue was not forth coming. The poor little boy was vexed, and quite in agitation. Mr. Ve&s;ey &s;aw and pitied his embarra&s;&s;ment, embraced him tenderly, and &s;aid as fol|lows: "Truly a mo&s;t elegant oration! You your&s;elf, no doubt, compo&s;ed it?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. papa; you are very good to think &s;o, but I am not half learned enough for &s;uch a ta&s;k. It was my brother that drew it up. You &s;hould have heard the whole. He told me that it was in periods; and the periods, he &s;aid, were rounded off into the bargain. Look ye, I will but run it over once, and you &s;hall hear it then: or would you rather hear mama's? I have <HI>that</HI> perfectly, I am &s;ure. It is extracted from the Grecian Hi&s;tory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Peregrine, it is not nece&s;&s;ary; and your mother and my&s;elf, without it, are as much indebted both to your affection and your brother's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he was a fortnight, I a&s;&s;ure you, at the work; and I employed a deal of time in learning them. What an unlucky thing that I &s;hould now forget, when I
<PB N="14" REF="20">mo&s;t wanted to remember it! No longer ago than la&s;t night, believe me, I delivered the whole &s;peech without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, in the &s;ervant's room, and &s;peaking to your wig-block, if it could but tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was then at &s;tudy in my clo&s;et, and to comfort you, mu&s;t &s;ay, I heard it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(brighteming up:)</STAGE> Did you?&mdash;I am glad of that! and do not you think, papa, that I &s;poke it very well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surpri&s;ingly, I mu&s;t acknowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but it was very fine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, your brother has quite crammed it full of eloquence. And yet, I &s;hould have liked a &s;ingle word or two much better from your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;ure, papa, to &s;ay that I wi&s;h the per&s;on to whom I am &s;peaking a happy new year, and nothing el&s;e, is far too common to give plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but why then nothing el&s;e? as if, in|&s;tead of offering &s;uch a naked compliment, you could not previou&s;ly have thought within your&s;elf, what I wi&s;hed mo&s;t of all to enjoy during the cour&s;e of this new year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that is not difficult. You wi&s;h, no doubt, to have your health, to &s;ee your family, your friends and fortune flouri&s;h, and to enjoy a deal of plea|&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; do not you wi&s;h me all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Reregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>What hinders then, but you could have made me up your&s;elf a charming compliment, without requiring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, I did not think my&s;elf &s;o learned; but it is always thus, when <HI>you</HI> in&s;truct me; &s;ince I find out things which I did not think were in me. I can now make compliments to every one that I know. I need &s;ay nothing but what I have mentioned ju&s;t this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may &s;uit, I mu&s;t acknowledge, many people; but &s;hould certainly be different with re&s;pect to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I under&s;tand you pretty well, papa; but I do not know what the difference &s;hould be; &s;o ex|plain it to me, now we are alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. There are a multitude of what are called good things, that one may wi&s;h any
<PB N="15" REF="21">per&s;on what&s;oever to enjoy; &s;uch as what you mentioned ju&s;t now: there are others, that refer to different indivi|duals according to their &s;ituations, age and duties. For example; one may wi&s;h to a man who is happy already, the long continuation of his happine&s;s; to an unhappy man, the end of his affliction; to a man in office, that God's providence may ble&s;s his labours for the public welfare, give him nece&s;&s;ary penetration, with the gift of per&s;everance to continue in them, and e&s;tabli&s;h the enjoy|ment of felicity among his countrymen, by way of re|compence on his endeavours. To an old man one may wi&s;h a length of life exempt from every inconveniency; to children, on the other hand, the pre&s;ervation of their parents, progre&s;s in their &s;tudies, with a love of arts; to parents, the completion of their hopes, in bringing up their children; every &s;pecies of pro&s;perity to &s;uch as are our benefactors: and the long continuation of their kind|ne&s;s. It is our duty even to bethink us of our enemies, and to pray that God may &s;how them the inju&s;tice of their conduct, and in&s;pire them with a wi&s;h of meriting our friend&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa, how much I thank you! I have now a budget full of compliments for every one. I &s;hall know what &s;ort of wi&s;hes they will expect, and have no occa&s;ion for my brother's rounded periods, as he calls them: but why, as we &s;hould always have the&s;e wi&s;hes in our heart, pray tell me why the fir&s;t day of the year, in preference to any other, &s;hould be pitched upon to publi&s;h them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e our life is, as it were, a ladder, every &s;tep of which is repre&s;ented by a year. It is natural that our friends &s;hould flock together, and make merry with us, when our foot has got in &s;afety on the &s;tep next to <HI>that</HI> which we lately trod, and to expre&s;s their wi&s;h that we &s;hould climb the re&s;t with equal &s;afety. Do you un|der&s;tand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa, quite clearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is however in my power to make this clearer &s;till, by u&s;ing what we call another figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, let us have it, pray, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you remember, then, our going to the top of that fine church in London, called St. Paul's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="22">
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what a charming pro&s;pect from the golden gallery there! Why, you remember we could &s;ee all London and a great deal of the country from it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Greenwich ho&s;pital particularly &s;truck your eye; and as you could not then have any notion of the di&s;tance, you propo&s;ed that we &s;hould the following week go there on foot to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, papa; and did I not, pray, walk the whole long journey like a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, well enough. I had no rea&s;on to find fault with your performance; but remember, I took care, at every mile-&s;tone on the road, to make you &s;it and re&s;t a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you did indeed; and it was in my opi|nion, no bad idea at the fir&s;t, to put up tho&s;e figured &s;tones be&s;ide the road. One knows at any time what di&s;|tance one has walked, how much is &s;till to come, and &s;o regulates one's pace accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this you have your&s;elf explained the ad|vantages which ari&s;e from our dividing life into tho&s;e equal portions that we call years: for every year is &s;ome|thing like a mile-&s;tone in the road of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you. And the &s;ea&s;ons are, per|haps, &s;o many quarter-miles, which tell us that we &s;hall very &s;oon arrive at the next &s;tone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ob&s;ervation is extremely ju&s;t; and I am glad that this little journey is &s;till fre&s;h in your re|membrance. If you take it in a proper point of view, it will exhibit a true picture of life. Remember, if you can, the different circum&s;tances that took place while you were po&s;ting on to Greenwich; tell them in the order in which they fell out, as well as you are able, and I will make the application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould &s;carce remember the whole bu&s;ine&s;s better, had it happened ye&s;terday. At fir&s;t, as I was full of &s;pirits and de&s;ired to let you &s;ee it, I &s;et out upon a trot and made a number of trips; I do not well know how many. You advi&s;ed me to go &s;lowly, as the journey would be rather long. I followed your advice and had no rea&s;on to repent. Upon the way, I a&s;ked for informa|tion at the &s;ight of every thing of which I did not know the meaning, and you were plea&s;ed to tell me. When we happened to go by a bit of gra&s;s, we &s;at down on it, and
<PB N="17" REF="23">you read a &s;tory-book that you had brought out in your pocket to divert me. Then we got upon our feet again; and as we went along, you told me many other things not only u&s;eful but diverting likewi&s;e. In this manner, though the weather was not altogether fine, though we had &s;ometimes rain, and once a hail-&s;torm to encounter, we arrived at Greenwich, I remember, very fre&s;h and hearty, and made afterwards a charming dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very faithfully related, Peregrine! but for &s;ome few circum&s;tances, which, however, I am glad you have not introduced; as for example, your attention to a poor blind man whom you caught by the arm, if you re|member, to prevent him from falling upon a heap of &s;tones that lay before him, and on which he might have broke his legs; the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that you afforded a poor wa&s;her woman's boy, by picking up a handkerchief of linen which had fallen out of the cart; but particularly the alms that you gave to &s;everal people on the road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think, then, papa, that I forgot them? I know that we &s;hould not boa&s;t of any good, that we may have had the opportunity of doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>And on that account, I am greatly plea&s;ed in dwelling on it, as a recompence for &s;o much mode&s;ty. It is ju&s;t that I &s;hould repay you &s;ome &s;mall portion of the joy which you cau&s;ed me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I &s;aw tears rolling in your eye, not once alone, nor twice, but often. I was &s;o delighted! if you knew how much that &s;ight made me forget my weari|ne&s;s! I walked much the better for it. But let me have the application that you ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is as follows, Peregrine. Give me all the attention in your power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing. I will not lo&s;e a &s;yllable, &s;ir, of what you tell me, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>The look, then, which you ca&s;t round you from the golden gallery, all over London, and a great deal, as you mentioned, of the country, is expre&s;&s;ive of the fir&s;t reflexions of a child upon the multitude about him. The long walk that you cho&s;e to Greenwich, is the journey which we propo&s;e to our&s;elves through life. The eagerne&s;s with which you wi&s;hed to hurry on at &s;et|ting out, without con&s;ulting your ability for running, and which co&s;t you &s;uch repeated trips, is the natural
<PB N="18" REF="24">impetuo&s;ity of youth which would excite us to the wor&s;t exce&s;&s;es, if a faithful and experienced friend were not to moderate it. The in&s;truction that you derived, as we were walking on, from reading and conver&s;ing with me, and the actions of good-will and charity that you per|formed, took off from the fatigue of &s;uch a journey; and you fini&s;hed it thereby with &s;atisfaction to your&s;elf, though there had fallen a deal of rain, and even hail. The&s;e circum&s;tances, too, convey in&s;truction; for in life there are no other means than the performance of our duty, to keep off di&s;quietude and to cheri&s;h peace within us, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune which would otherwi&s;e, perhaps, go near to overwhelm us: and the comfortable meal that we made at the conclu&s;ion of our journey is no other than an emblem of the recom|pence which God gives us when we die, to crown tho&s;e virtuous actions that we have laboured to perform while in this world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, papa; all this &s;quares wonderfully well, and I &s;hall have a deal of happine&s;s, I &s;ee before|hand, in the year that is now begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It re&s;ts with your&s;elf alone to make the year quite happy; but once more, let us return to our excur|&s;ion. Do you recollect when in going round, that we might &s;ee a little of the park, we came upon Blackheath? The heavens were then &s;erene, and we could &s;ee behind us all the way that we had been walking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, papa! and I was proud of having walked &s;o far!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>By <HI>proud,</HI> you mean rejoiced. Are you then equally rejoiced at pre&s;ent, while your rea&s;on which now dawns within you, pau&s;es and ca&s;t back a look upon the way that you have already made in life? You entered it quite weak and naked, without any means of making, in the lea&s;t degree, provi&s;ion for your wants. It was your mother who gave you your fir&s;t food, and it is I that have the forethought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t you. How do we de&s;ire you to repay us? We want nothing more, than that you &s;hould your&s;elf endeavour to be happy, by becoming ju&s;t and hone&s;t; by acquiring a due notion of your &s;everal duties; and by &s;eriou&s;ly intending to di&s;charge them. Have you then fulfilled the&s;e few conditions, no le&s;s advantageous to your&s;elf than ea&s;y? Have you fir&s;t of all been grateful
<PB N="19" REF="25">to God's goodne&s;s, who has willed that you &s;hould be born of parents po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing wherewithal to bring you up in ea&s;e and honour? Have you always &s;hewn tho&s;e parents the obedience and re&s;pect that you owe them? Have you paid attention to the precepts of your teachers? Have you never given occa&s;ion for your brothers or your &s;i&s;ters to com|plain of envy or inju&s;tice in you? Have you always treated tho&s;e who wait upon you, with a proper &s;ort of conde|&s;cen&s;ion, and at no time claimed from their inferior &s;itua|tion, what it was their duty to refu&s;e you? In a word, do you po&s;&s;e&s;s that love of ju&s;tice, that equality of con|duct, and that moderation which we, by our in&s;truction and example, are at all times doing what we can to &s;et before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peregrine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, papa, let us not look &s;o much at what is pa&s;t, but to the future. Every thing that I &s;hould have done, I promi&s;e by God's ble&s;&s;ing to do hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ve&s;ey.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is well &s;aid: embrace me, therefore, Peregrine. I accept your promi&s;e, and confine to its per|formance all the wi&s;hes that I need make, on my &s;ide, for your happine&s;s, on this renewal of the year.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO early with us, Ma&s;ter Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Archibald; and what is more, I want to &s;peak with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>With me, &s;ir? What can occa&s;ion me the honour of your vi&s;it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What except the plea&s;ure, Archibald, of &s;ee|ing you? The truth however is, that I am come to know what Chri&s;tmas-boxes you have had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Chri&s;tmas-boxes, do you a&s;k me? If my mother, &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf have but the nece&s;&s;ary things of life, we are content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Mr. Damer, &s;urely, lets you want for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, we are his debtors for whatever we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and he continues in our favour the re&s;pect, as I may call it, that he had for my poor father; and his &s;on, too, has a friend&s;hip for us. Do you &s;ee, &s;ir, this new &s;uit of clothes upon me? it is Edward's pre|&s;ent. It was bought for him, but his papa permitted him to give it me, by way of Chri&s;tmas-box. He has pre|vailed
<PB N="21" REF="27">too on Mi&s;s Veronica to pre&s;ent my &s;i&s;ter with a few of her ca&s;t clothes; and we were la&s;t night very happy in receiving them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e &s;o; but if you talk of Chri&s;tmas|boxes, it is he that has received &s;ome fine ones no doubt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, his father is &s;o rich! and yet, I know not if his plea&s;ure was as great as ours. Fine things are no novelties to him. And what we may receive, whenever we think proper, never gives us &s;o much joy as what <HI>they</HI> feel to whom their benefactors unexpectedly make pre&s;ents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in this: but cannot you tell me what Edward has received? No doubt he has &s;hown you all his pre&s;ents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, that he has indeed: but how &s;hall I remember the whole catalogue? Let me reflect a little. In the fir&s;t place, he has had &s;ome books, a ca&s;e of mathe|matical in&s;truments, a micro&s;cope, &s;ilk &s;tockings, and a &s;et of &s;ilver buttons for a &s;uit of clothes, compleat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tho&s;e are not the things that I mean. What I want to know about, friend Archibald, are the &s;weetmeats and nice things, that generally are pre&s;ented, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, to children of our age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! his papa has given him no &s;uch things: he &s;ays that &s;weetmeats do but rot the teeth; and as for play-things, certainly Edward is too big, to wi&s;h for &s;uch matters. It is only from his aunt that he received trifles of this &s;ort. She, indeed, has given him &s;ome of what you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay! and what for in&s;tance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I remember them? There is in the fir&s;t place, a great cake; a quantity of candied orange peel; &s;ome capillaire; and &s;weetmeats; half-a-dozen companies of French and Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, ca&s;t in lead, and in their uniforms; a draft-board; fi&s;h and counters; and about a dozen china figures made in Derby&s;hire. But rather go and &s;peak to him your&s;elf. He will &s;how you every thing that he has received. Why do you put the&s;e &s;everal que&s;tions to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I know what I am doing. I had my rea&s;ons for interrogating you, before I went up &s;tairs into Edward's room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="28">
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what, pray, are tho&s;e rea&s;ons? May I know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had determined never to reveal them: but, provided you will but be &s;ecret&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am no prater.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me your promi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is my hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I will tell you, as a &s;ecret that I would have you keep, Edward is finely taken in!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Edward finely taken in! my friend? I can|not endure &s;uch language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will tell you nothing. I am &s;till ma&s;|ter of my &s;ecret; you know that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Charles! And can you wrong, then, my dear friend Edward at this rate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! be a&s;&s;ured, I &s;hall not wrong him per&s;on|ally: but I &s;peak of an affair in which we both have come to an agreement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, if taken in, he is deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no: he has deceived him&s;elf entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not under&s;tand a word of this enigma.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will explain the matter to you. We had previou&s;ly agreed to go equal &s;harers in our Chri&s;tmas|boxes, what&s;oever they might be, re&s;pecting every thing that in its nature was divi&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray, and can he lo&s;e by &s;uch a bar|gain? His papa is not &s;o rich as yours. Your Chri&s;tmas|boxes therefore mu&s;t, at lea&s;t in point of value, equal his, and very probably exceed them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, I have received a very hand&s;ome Chri&s;tmas-box. This watch, for in&s;tance; but a watch, you know, cannot be divided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>On your honour, you have had no other pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, I a&s;&s;ure you, but a cake and two &s;mall boxes of pre&s;erves. My father &s;ays, as Mr. Damer does, that &s;weetmeats hurt one. While mama was living it was quite another thing, for then I had &s;uch delicacies in abundance; and Edward knows as much, who &s;aw my la&s;t year's Chri&s;tmas-boxes. It was this that induced him to make &s;uch a bargain with me; and la&s;t week too, we confirmed it on our word. You &s;ee, then&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="29">
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I &s;ee too clearly, that Edward is to be your dupe. He will have only half a cake and &s;ome pre|&s;erves for what he is to give you up. It is true, his aunt has &s;ent him more than he can eat. But is it true then, Ma&s;ter Charles, that you had nothing el&s;e? I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I find it very difficult to credit your a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Difficult to credit my a&s;&s;ertion! Shall I &s;wear, then, to the truth of what I &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Swear! Fye! Should a little gentleman, as you are, think of &s;wearing in this matter? It is entirely your affair; and if you are deceiving my good friend Ed|ward, you will lo&s;e much more than he, Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Archibald, do you know that I do not approve of &s;uch remon&s;trances? It is Edward's bu&s;ine&s;s to reflect on the affair. Suppo&s;e Edward had received no Chri&s;tmas-box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was no fear of that. His friends are generous, and Edward's conduct plea&s;es them. Your Chri&s;tmas-box is &s;uch a trifle! It would be quite unhand|&s;ome in you, to expect that Edward &s;hould have all the di&s;advantage on his &s;ide; and therefore we mu&s;t go and tell him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is done already. Late la&s;t night I &s;ent him half the cake that I received, and part of my pre|&s;erves. I have likewi&s;e written him a little letter on the &s;ubject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you will per&s;i&s;t in your demand upon him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray what would you do, in my &s;itua|tion? You that talk &s;o much!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have nothing from him, having nothing upon my &s;ide to be&s;tow; and therefore quit him of his promi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! your humble &s;ervant! Keep your coun&s;el to your&s;elf. Our bargain is a wager; and when people think of laying wagers, it is that they may win. Next year it &s;hall be as he plea&s;es; but at pre&s;ent, if he does not give me half of every thing that he has received, his cake, his orange-peel, his &s;weetmeats, &s;oldiers, fi&s;h and counters, china ware, and any thing el&s;e that you may have forgot to mention, I will follow him through all the &s;treets, courts, lanes, and every thoroughfare in London, and proclaim him for a cheat. Yes, tell him that from
<PB N="24" REF="30">me, friend Archibald; and, that &s;uch as we &s;hould keep our promi&s;e, after we have &s;worn to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>After you have &s;worn! Fie, fie upon your oaths! I am very poor; and yet, if you would give me all the Chri&s;tmas-boxes that ever you received, not ex|cepting even your fine watch, I would not &s;wear in &s;uch a trifling matter. It &s;hould be a very &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s only that would make me take an oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Archibald, you are a downright &s;im|pleton. Without this &s;wearing, how &s;hould any one be bound to keep his promi&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you a&s;k that &s;eriou&s;ly? His very promi&s;e &s;hould compel him to ob&s;erve it, and the word of hone&s;t people be as &s;acred as an oath. If you judge otherwi&s;e, I do not know what I am to think of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your idea, then, that Edward will be faithful to his promi&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>My idea? Should he break it, in&s;ignificant as I mu&s;t own my&s;elf, I would never look upon him as long as I have breath. But no, he will not break it; and to keep his word, will have no manner of occa&s;ion for an oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we &s;hall &s;ee. However, tell him every thing that I have &s;aid, that he may act accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need tell him nothing. He does not want a monitor to do his duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray add, I wi&s;h him joy that he is &s;o finely taken in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you would in&s;ult, as well as&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but I divert my&s;elf at his expence, as he would do at mine. Let him alone! Another time, if he thinks proper, he may be revenged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; this is the only bu&s;ine&s;s of the kind that ever he will tranfact with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>As he plea&s;es. I have wherewithal, by this day's lucky bu&s;ine&s;s, to con&s;ole my&s;elf.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Archibald,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>alone.</HI>)</STAGE> I could not have imagined Charles &s;o mercenary. If, in truth, he has no more than what he tells me from his father, why then did he not break off the bargain, when he found it likely to pre&s;s &s;o hard upon his friend? What avarice! and what meanne&s;s likewi&s;e! It is Edward's fault, however, and will hardly ruin him. But here he comes.</P>

<P>Have you not the other half &s;till left? Well then, imagine your&s;elf to have received no more; but think particularly how much reputation &s;uch an action will procure you in men's eyes, when they ob&s;erve that you put no value upon what the generality of children &s;o fondly prize, but can &s;corn them when your word is to be kept. As many as are told of your fidelity will love you. Grant|ing Charles de&s;igns to trick you, I am &s;ure, he will never have the courage afterwards to look you in the face; whereas, upon the other hand, you will walk before him with your head up, &s;ure of the e&s;teem of all good people. Yes, my dear Edward, let us always deal uprightly, what|&s;oever price it co&s;ts us. Ah! if I were rich, you &s;hould not have to mourn your lo&s;s a moment upon this occa&s;ion.

<P>My age is the cau&s;e why I have more obli|gation to him than the young ones. I know the Commo|dore, madam, longer than you do. Many a time have I &s;et him a riding upon this very &s;tick. He was not &s;o big as ma&s;ter Con&s;tantine here, when he began to be my be|nefactor. I was poor then, and he had no more than his pocket-money. Well, he found means to relieve me out of many difficulties even with that. It was in vain that I told him only half of my di&s;tre&s;s. He could gue&s;s more than I could hide from him. As &s;oon as he came to his e&s;tate, he made me a pre&s;ent of the cottage that I inhabit, and let me &s;ome lands which are round about it, but on &s;o favourable a lea&s;e that I &s;oon got above the world. Thanks to his friend&s;hip, I have been able to bring up all my children, and to &s;ettle them ea&s;ily in the world, which as I have done through his means, I count them as much his family as mine, and love them the better on that &s;core.</P>

<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible! But I believe it, and it is no more than he ought.

<P>Commodore Freeport, &s;till agitated with the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations that he experienced during the cour&s;e of the day, could not clo&s;e his eyes till long after midnight, when at length a grateful &s;lumber &s;tole upon him, and &s;oft dreams compo&s;ed his agitated bo&s;om. In the morn|ing, the fir&s;t objects that he beheld about him were his children, who had placed them&s;elves around his bed in expectation of his waking. He received their &s;weet ca|re&s;&s;es, cla&s;ped them tenderly him&s;elf, and putting on his clothes as quickly as he could, went down into the garden with them.</P>
<P>The &s;erenity then reigning round about, the plea&s;ure of revi&s;iting tho&s;e places which his own hands had culti|vated in times pa&s;t, and of being once again re&s;tored in &s;afety to his family, when &s;uch an interval of &s;eparation had elap&s;ed, and even the recollection of the dangers to which he had often been expo&s;ed, every thing in&s;pired him with un&s;peakable affection; and his children, &s;en&s;ible of this, employed the opportunity to a&s;k him que&s;tion after que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71">He gave a relation of every thing worth knowing, that had happened to him in his many and perilous voyages, of the &s;torms that had attacked his &s;hips, and the ha|zardous expeditions in which he was concerned.

<P>During his recital, he was careful to remark what &s;ort of feelings it excited in their hearts, and what was the expre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e feelings on their countenances. At the &s;lighte&s;t mention of the dangers that he had encountered, he felt the little girls, by in&s;tinct as it were, pre&s;s tenderly to him: they &s;ighed, and now and then let fall a tear; while Con&s;tantine, his &s;on, was animated, and &s;eemed ready, or at lea&s;t his features &s;poke him ready, to en|counter the &s;ame degree of danger. In particular, at the recital of any warlike action, you might &s;ee his brea&s;t heave, and his eyes &s;parkle like fire.</P>

Ju&s;t &s;o, like|wi&s;e, does the &s;oldier watch the &s;tate, of which he is a member, to &s;uppre&s;s &s;editions that might ri&s;e within it, and repel the inva&s;ion of ambitious nations dwelling round about it.</P>

<P>If I prevail upon my tenants to take arms, and if they can obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a field belonging, as I &s;aid ju&s;t now, to Mr. Marchmont, is it not pretty likely that Mr. Marchmont will give his tenants arms, and beg them to defend that field, which they mu&s;t know is his; and very po&s;&s;ibly encourage them to &s;eize on &s;omething that belongs to me?</P>

<P>If &s;o, then I am plunged into a &s;ea of trou|ble, and mu&s;t always be upon the watch, that I may rob my neighbour, or prevent his robbing me.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Con&s;tantine! it is not on the &s;ize of an e&s;tate that its worth depends, but on the care which one takes to cultivate it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; for only think of Wil&s;don-heath, where Mr. Bramble lives. Why, no one in his &s;en&s;es would give up the fourth part of &s;uch an orchard as we have for all that heath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ea&s;ily believe you. Wil&s;don-heath produces only furze and thorns, while our orchard bears a deal of fruit.</P>
</SP>

<P>But what would hinder you from cultivating all the land that you might have taken from your neigh|bour?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have before hand lo&s;t in the di&s;pute a number of my tenants, and a portion of the re&s;t are &s;till employed in arms, who then will cultivate my fields?

<PB N="68" REF="74">If I impo&s;e upon them, they will leave their farms, and chu&s;e more kind and peaceful landlords than my&s;elf. Of cour&s;e, I &s;hall have none about me but armed tenants. who, if ever they conceive them&s;elves ill treated, will be likely to con&s;pire again&s;t me.</P>

<P>Let us now, on the other hand, &s;uppo&s;e, Con&s;tantine, that in&s;tead of vexing any of the nations round me; for I drop the idea of a landlord and &s;peak as if I were the king of England and alluded to the king of France; &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, that in&s;tead of vexing any of the king of France's &s;ubjects, I &s;hould do my utmo&s;t to attach them to me by a commerce advantageous both to them and my own people, and by being &s;crupulou&s;ly careful to prevent whatever might ocea&s;ion, for the time to come, divi&s;ion and di&s;pute between us; and &s;hould give encou|ragement, within my own dominions, to the arts of agri|culture, &s;o that every one of my &s;ubjects might enjoy, if he thought fit, the &s;weets of peace, and that &s;erenity which always flows from ju&s;tice; &s;hould I not be happier, through the happine&s;s of every one about me, than from any boa&s;t of having conquered? And in that ca&s;e, would not my dominion be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a much more &s;olid ba&s;e than if I had enlarged its limits, when the con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that every part becomes much weaker?</P>

<P>Exactly &s;uch is the pretext a&s;&s;igned in general by all conquerors. But what happened to the little boy? When he had fini&s;hed eating, he grew &s;ick. The aliments that we &s;wallow, being meant to &s;trengthen us, it is very natural to fancy that the more we take the &s;tronger we &s;hall be: &s;o al&s;o it is not unnatural for a child to fancy that a prince, who&s;e territories are increa&s;ed, &s;hould find his power increa&s;ed in proportion. But in reality, it is with a kingdom ju&s;t as with our &s;tomach. Being over|charged, it mu&s;t be out of order. If the little boy had been contented with the piece that he had received, (for you mu&s;t know he was an ailing child, and therefore had not &s;o much as his &s;i&s;ter who was very hearty,) it would have dige&s;ted properly and &s;trengthened him; whereas, by eating more than he could bear, it had the effect upon him which I have ju&s;t now mentioned. If his &s;i&s;ter, fol|lowing the example that he had &s;et her, had proceeded upon this to take away his bit of cake by force, as little as &s;he was, he would not have had &s;ufficient &s;trength to &s;ave it from her.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, perhaps, he would have thought of the inju&s;tice that he had done, and yielded it without a &s;truggle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a genero&s;ity of which the common &s;ort of conquerors are not capable to one another. If they were but &s;o in favour of their &s;ubjects only, how could they reflect upon the multitude of victims which they mu&s;t &s;acrifice upon the altar of their vengeance or ambition, the fir&s;t time they combat with the people whom they have made their enemies, and not be &s;truck with horror at the thought? I &s;hould imagine it would be well, if kings, upon the point of undertaking any war, &s;hould have a picture hung before them, &s;etting forth the horrors of that war, &s;o that their fancies might be ince&s;&s;antly affected with the idea of it; and at midnight, when all nature otherwi&s;e is &s;till about them, might hear the groans of
<PB N="70" REF="76">wounded men reproaching them as the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e pains which they &s;uffer, the de&s;pairing cries of wives and mothers loading them with cur&s;es, and the clamours of a people fami&s;hing for want of bread. Their &s;ouls are &s;ome|times wrought on, by unju&s;t &s;olicitations, to grant crimi|nals their life; and yet they &s;ign, without remor&s;e, what &s;hall condemn to death even thou&s;ands of their unoffend|ing &s;ubjects. A good king employs whole years in medi|tating on a project that may finally prove beneficial to &s;ome portion of his &s;tate, to population, trade, or agriculture. Twenty years &s;hall pa&s;s away before the pro|ject is perfected; while a warlike, that is, cruel king &s;hall, by the re&s;olution of a moment, half exterminate his people, put a &s;top to agriculture, tie up the indu&s;trious hands of artizans, deprive the poor of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by depriving them of daily work, reduce whole families to di&s;&s;olution, and at la&s;t entirely overthrow his realm!</P>

<P>And this is an addition to the evils which it foments; for, not to &s;peak of tho&s;e antipathies which the inequality of wealth produces in the hearts of &s;uch as are each other's neighbours, tho&s;e enormous fortunes cheri&s;h a degree of luxury that cannot but corrupt men's manners to the la&s;t exce&s;s. The pomp with which it is &s;urrounded, the enjoyment which it procures, the &s;hameful deference or re&s;pect which men dare not, if they would, refu&s;e it, &s;timulate the generality of tho&s;e who are upon an equal footing in regard to rank with the luxurious, but le&s;s wealthy, to affect it with the &s;ame indecency, that they may either &s;atisfy their pride or keep up their re&s;pectabi|lity. They wa&s;te their real wealth in keeping up their luxury, that they may gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;hadowy wealth which they fancy they <HI>&s;hall</HI> get. Intimidated by the dread of their approaching ruin, if they do not ha&s;ten to prevent it by unlawful methods, they embark in dan|gerous enterpri&s;es, and expo&s;e not only their own pro|perty, but whatever may be entru&s;ted in their hands by others whom the hope of a fallacious profit will inveigle to be partners in their &s;chemes. Their ruin is at la&s;t an|nounced; but the example will not terrify cupidity which always hopes to pro&s;per more than others, by employing &s;ubtler artifices: and as &s;oon as probity is given up, then
<PB N="71" REF="77">mutual tru&s;t is bani&s;hed, and a nation's commerce peri&s;hes through the exce&s;s of that abundance which it created.</P>

<P>But if any land grows rich by peace, &s;hould we not always have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to fear the &s;ame mi&s;|fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. It is only &s;uddenly made fortunes that intoxicate the minds of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and excite them to abu&s;e their wealth. Fortunes gradually gained, or in the ordinary cour&s;e of commerce, are in con&s;equence of many years con&s;umed in toil. Men hardly ever di&s;&s;i|pate the trea&s;ure which they have laboured hard to ac|quire, but lay it by, to &s;erve them in the weari&s;ome con|dition of old age: be&s;ides, their fortunes are, in that ca&s;e, much more equable, and every one is rich, while no one overflows with wealth. The country, having far le&s;s wants in that &s;erenity with which commerce ble&s;&s;es it, is not under the nece&s;&s;ity of grinding the laborious hu&s;|bandman; but, on the contrary, is able to encourage him in furni&s;hing the trading part of the community with tho&s;e &s;upplies of corn and other fruits of the earth which it re|quires.&mdash;An empire &s;trengthened thus by trade and agri|culture, may give laws to other empires, even on account of its tranquillity. Its neighbours fear it, and in&s;tead of making inroads on a people who mu&s;t be too powerful for them, &s;eek alliance with that people. This alliance draws mankind together, roots out national antipathies, and kindles &s;entiments of unity and concord in their &s;tead. The prince has only to prevent abu&s;es in the &s;tate. A perfect legi&s;lation cau&s;es ju&s;tice and &s;trict order to prevail among his people, and they pa&s;s from individuals to whole &s;tates. Trade, arts, and &s;ciences, may be compared to bridges that extend from one to the other, and on which not only Peace, but Plenty, con&s;tantly walk to and fro, that they may keep inviolate the happine&s;s of tho&s;e whom they have united.</P>

<P>I conceive your meaning pretty clearly: yet, in ca&s;e there be no war, then &s;oldiers are unnece&s;&s;ary, and my regiment mu&s;t be broke before I join it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o fa&s;t, Con&s;tantine; for an undefended &s;tate would be expo&s;ed, by rea&s;on of its riches, to a mul|titude of enemies. It &s;hould keep up a regulated force in peace, if it would have one in the time of war. But then, in&s;tead of looking on an unconcerned &s;pectator,
<PB N="72" REF="78">while the military quench their &s;pirit in debauchery and &s;loth, it &s;hould a&s;&s;ign them labours to keep up their &s;trength, and make them u&s;eful to the &s;tate. They &s;hould be &s;tationed on the public roads, and &s;uch as are employed at pre&s;ent on them never quit the plow and &s;ickle: an additional connexion would, in that ca&s;e, forcibly unite them to their country, in that natural propen&s;ity which men feel to value what their indu&s;try in &s;ome &s;ort has created, and the pride with which they are at all times ready to defend it. The &s;uperior officer, who &s;hould di|rect their labours, would not, we mu&s;t own, ob&s;erve his name recorded in the papers of the day, and no where el&s;e, for trifling enterpri&s;es, &s;uch as hi&s;tory de&s;cends not to perpetuate; but would him&s;elf engrave it on a pillar, rai&s;ed upon the &s;pot where once a&s;cended a high hill that he &s;hould have levelled, on the &s;ide of a canal or po&s;t that he &s;hould have dug, or at the opening of a bridge that he &s;hould have built. The traveller then would come from the remote&s;t part of Europe to con&s;ider the magnificence and boldne&s;s of his toil, his countrymen would ble&s;s the benefits accruing from it, and a generation not then born, would in future time ri&s;e up, and wonder at its durability. The colour of his coat no longer would excite one thought of blood&s;hed, but of gratitude, &s;o ju&s;tly due to benefits, and of re&s;pect invariably paid to the ingenious. His lei|&s;ure moments would be &s;pent in the exten&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;ciences which he had formerly &s;tudied, and in &s;ugge&s;ting plans of policy, re&s;ulting from his ob&s;ervations made in different countries. Retiring in the end, to pa&s;s away the re&s;idue of life on his e&s;tate with honour, in the recol|lection of tho&s;e benefits which he had communicated to his country, his activity would flouri&s;h &s;till in agriculture. I even dare propo&s;e my&s;elf as an example. I am inclined to think that I have been &s;erviceable to my king in India; but &s;hall much more boa&s;t of benefiting for the time to come my native land, by cultivating the inheritance which a father left me, and by giving you, my children, a be|coming education. I &s;hall do my utmo&s;t to atone for any involuntary violence that I may have done humanity, by being henceforth a protector of the needy round about me; and I hope I &s;hall not die without the con&s;cious &s;atisfac|tion which a good citizen enjoys, in having carefully di&s;charged his duty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Com. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Con&s;tantine, but becau&s;e they have un|fortunately been brought up in prejudices, and not had &s;ufficient re&s;olution to correct them? Hitherto, philo&s;o|phers have &s;poken to none but tho&s;e who&s;e under&s;tandings could not &s;ee the truth and beauty of tho&s;e principles which I have happily been taught. Nor is there any hope that men, now come to years of rea&s;on and reflexion, &s;hould be taught to &s;ee them! &s;o that tho&s;e philo&s;ophers mu&s;t get new pupils. In infancy the future man mu&s;t be prepared. By giving him betimes a tincture of inte|grity, beneficence and genero&s;ity, he will obtain, in his maturity, the habit of di&s;playing them in every action of his life; and place his glory in contributing, as far as he is able, to that general revolution &s;o much to be wi&s;hed for in behalf of virtue. A young prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e exalted notions, and per&s;uaded that the ri&s;ing gene|ration have them too, might rationally hope to govern a new &s;ort of people, who would certainly afford a model to all other lands. Congratulate your&s;elves, dear children, on the circum&s;tance of being born in tho&s;e au&s;picious times, when children are, not only here, but univer&s;ally throughout all Europe, the peculiar objects who&s;e feli|city philo&s;ophers are &s;tudying to promote; and not they only, but even women&mdash;women, notwith&s;tanding narrow|mindedne&s;s delights at all times to di&s;parage, as it does, their under&s;tanding. Perhaps for you, and your contem|poraries, is re&s;erved the happine&s;s of &s;eeing the la&s;t traces of inju&s;tice and barbarity effaced among mankind. Thrice happy I, my&s;elf, if giving now the&s;e fir&s;t ideas of a &s;y&s;tem of morality, &s;o &s;imple but &s;ublime, I take but one &s;tep forward in the bu&s;ine&s;s of e&s;tabli&s;hing this &s;y&s;tem in your hearts.

<P>COLONEL Orm&s;by, who by his merit had attained to that high rank, ob&s;erved with great concern that the officers belonging to his regiment gave their time and faculties entirely up to play.

<P>I was no &s;ooner come from college, than my parents bought me an En&s;igney, then vacant in the regiment which I have now the honour to command. The love that I had contracted in my infancy for &s;tudy, made them hope to &s;ee me equally de&s;irous of di&s;charging the duties of my new condition, and of attaining the reputation at which in the confidence of their hope they de&s;tined me one day to arrive.

I could hardly bring my&s;elf to quit the gaming table for an hour, however I might &s;tand in need of re&s;t. In &s;leep, I dreamed of heaps of good and &s;ilver. I was always &s;huffling cards, and a continual noi&s;e of dice was in my ear.</P>
<P>The natural nece&s;&s;ity of eating was become my puni&s;h|ment: I &s;wallowed up my meat in ha&s;te, that I might be as little ab&s;ent from my gambling partners as I could.</P>

I had lo&s;t the night before, not only every thing that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the world my&s;elf, but likewi&s;e the whole &s;um delivered me for this re|cruiting &s;ervice. Think then, gentlemen, what mu&s;t have been my &s;orrow and de&s;pair in &s;uch a &s;ituation! I di&s;patched that moment an expre&s;s to where our regi|ment lay in quarters; and ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ing my mi&s;conduct, begged a brother officer to lend me what I wanted.</P>
<P>How! replied that officer, give up &s;o great a &s;um of money to a profe&s;&s;ed gambler? No; if I mu&s;t either lo&s;e
<PB N="79" REF="85">my property, or give up my connection with a man who&s;e conduct makes his friend&s;hip infamous, I chu&s;e to keep my property.</P>
<P>Immediately on reading this in&s;ulting an&s;wer, I was utterly be&s;ide my&s;elf; and &s;till remember, as what hap|pened ye&s;terday, the dreadful images which all at once came crowding into my imagination: on the one hand, the di&s;tre&s;s and indignation of my father, the di&s;honour that I was fixing on my family, as well as on every one that knew me, and the dread of being broke with in|famy; on the other hand, the briliant pro&s;pect of that promotion which I might have obtained, by an honour|able conduct in my po&s;t: nor did I afterwards recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my under&s;tanding, but to think of perpetra|ting a new crime, that I might be delivered from that ignominy which my fir&s;t would bring upon me. I was ready to go through with &s;uch a de&s;perate re&s;olution, when I &s;aw the very officer come into my apartment, who&s;e reply had hurried me, as I have &s;aid ju&s;t now, into this &s;tate of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t emotion of my rage, I fell upon him like a fiend; but he di&s;armed me very quickly; and while I but little thought of what was to en&s;ue, embraced me, and began as follows. "I replied a little har&s;hly to your letter, as I meant, by &s;uch an an&s;wer, that you &s;hould &s;ee the horror of that &s;ituation into which your ra&s;hne&s;s has pecipitated you; and I perceive what effect it has up|on you. Now therefore that you repent, my property, my life, and every thing that I have, you may command, as you think proper."</P>
<P>"Here," continued he, and threw his pur&s;e upon the table, "here is what will &s;erve to pay your new recruits: and the remainder may &s;upply you at the gaming-table, if you mean to return thither."</P>
<P>Return to the gaming-table! Never, never, an&s;wered I; and cla&s;ped him to my heart.</P>
<P>Since which, I have preci&s;ely kept my word. From that day forward I determined to have done with all expen|&s;ive plea&s;ures, and apply my &s;avings to the purpo&s;e of re|paying what my generous friend had lent me. I employed my lei&s;ure time in &s;tudy. My attention to the &s;ervice recommended me to my &s;uperiors; and to &s;uch a happy
<PB N="80" REF="86">lution in the cour&s;e of my affairs I am indebted for the honour of my pre&s;ent &s;tation in the army.</P>
<P>This recital made &s;o powerful an impre&s;&s;ion on his officers, that every game of hazard cea&s;ed among them, and a noble emulation to arrive at u&s;eful knowledge quenched that low ambition of winning money which was their ruling pa&s;&s;ion before. Such was the good con&s;e|quence re&s;ulting from their prudent colonel's le&s;&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRODIGAL DOUBLY PUNISHED.</HEAD>
<P>A Worthy private gentleman, ob&s;erving with concern his only &s;on upon the point of taking to a &s;pend|thrift way of living, let him do as he thought proper; and it was not long before the &s;on had run him&s;elf behind hand to a great amount. I will pay whatever debt you may contract, &s;aid the father to him, as my honour is much dearer to me than my money; but take notice of what follows: You love joyous living, and I love the poor. I have given away in charity a great deal le&s;s than I was u&s;ed to do before I thought of your e&s;tabli&s;hment. I will think no longer of it; a libertine &s;hould never marry; &s;o indulge your&s;elf as much as you think proper, but on this condition: I declare, that when, at any time, you &s;pend beyond the money which I allow you to keep your&s;elf as a gentleman, &s;ome ho&s;pital, or other charitable in&s;titution, &s;hall receive from me as much as you require to &s;atisfy your debts; and I will begin this very day. Accordingly the money was that moment ordered to a certain charity; and thus the youth, on being doubly puni&s;hed for his pro|digality, was quickly cured of a di&s;ea&s;e which otherwi&s;e would have in&s;ured his ruin.</P>

<P>Alas! what are they?</P>

<P>They cheated you, no doubt. But &s;till there is no great mi&s;chief done; for never play again, and then your lo&s;s will be a gain.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jonathan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is not the whole.

<P>True; but my poor brother, I mu&s;t &s;ay, is innocent, and &s;omewhat credulous: he judges every one to be like him&s;elf. What would become of him, if tho&s;e whom he thinks his friends were what they &s;hould not be? I have remarked, that you do not much approve of Jona|than's intimates.</P>

<P>To &s;ay the truth, my dear young lady, I &s;hould rather wi&s;h that Jonathan would be &s;atisfied with Augu&s;|tine's friend&s;hip. There is one advantage, notwith&s;tand|ing, that his father watches over him, as yours does over Augu&s;tine, and in&s;tructs him what to do.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure, you love your brother tenderly, and therefore hear me; but tell nobody that I mentioned what I am going now to &s;ay. Young Jonathan has pre|vailed upon him, ju&s;t before you entered, to make one with him and his three intimates. They mean to play, no doubt; but do your utmo&s;t to divert your brother from partaking with them. I de&s;igned to wait here for his an|&s;wer, but do not think it proper that I &s;hould carry it. I make no doubt but he will bring it pre&s;ently. Pray do not judge ami&s;s of me that I retire; and think of the ad|vice which my duty, as a friend to Augu&s;tine, bade me give you.</P>

<P>Honoria's remark is not ami&s;s.

<P>With this material difference, that at <HI>one and thirty,</HI> chance alone decides; whereas, in many others, &s;kill is to be &s;hown. In &s;hort, one wants but fingers, and no head for games of chance: and in my thought, &s;uch games are utterly unworthy of a thinking man.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fletcher.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e the love of money makes it &s;o. And as this love of money operates very powerfully, it is a &s;trong temptation for ten thou&s;and rogues to follow gaming as a trade; and therefore un&s;u&s;pecting people ge|nerally are their dupes.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<HEAD>THE MONKEY.</HEAD>
<P>FRANCIS, and his play-mate Lorenzo, were at the window. As it chanced, they heard a pipe and ta|bor. Looking up the &s;treet, they &s;aw a bear approaching &s;ternly, and a man conducting him by a chain to which the creature was fa&s;tened at the other end. I &s;hould be afraid, &s;aid Lozenzo, to &s;tand too near that animal; for do but li&s;ten, Francis: Did you ever hear &s;uch growling? I &s;hould quake if I were by him. Oh, he could not hurt you, an&s;wered Francis; you may &s;ee, he has a muzzle to prevent his biting.</P>
<P>They were talking thus, when Bruin was come exactly oppo&s;ite their window, in his progre&s;s down the &s;treet. Two monkies now took up the little gentlemen's atten|tion. One was light and nimble, but the other not &s;o active. Both were jumping to and fro on Bruin's back, who &s;uffered them to play their tricks as if he did not care about it. They had fruit in plenty thrown them by the mob, which they caught in their paws as &s;oon as it was flung to them, and &s;wallowed almo&s;t in&s;tantly. But what delighted them particularly, were the nuts which the peo|ple threw them. Seated on their breech, and holding them between their two fore-paws, they broke the &s;hells, and picked the kernels out with &s;omething of an air.</P>
<P>It chanced that a very large one came among the re&s;t. The heavy monkey rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his long hind-legs to get it; but the little one darting forward, &s;eized it in the air before it could have time to reach him. Cheated of his prey in this manner by the little one, he gna&s;hed his teeth with rage. His front grew wrinkled, and his eyes fla&s;hed fire: he thru&s;t his claws out, fell upon the little one, and &s;eemed upon the point of tearing him to bits. The bear found it very difficult to &s;ave him.</P>
<P>Do you &s;ee, &s;aid Francis to his little friend, how fright|ful that &s;ame monkey is become &s;ince fir&s;t he fell into a rage, and how he &s;hews his teeth? Oh no, I &s;hould not like to be within his reach! How terrible! I &s;hould be &s;cared to death!</P>
<P>Indeed? &s;aid Lorenzo. Well then, can you imagine it; but ye&s;terday, when you were in a pa&s;&s;ion, you were like
<PB N="107" REF="113">him. Look ye, you had all his wrinkles; you even grinned as he does now; your eyes &s;hewed what a pa&s;&s;ion you were in, and like the monkey, you &s;eemed ready to devour poor little Harry, who had notwith&s;tanding done you no great harm. I only wi&s;hed that I could have got a looking-gla&s;s. Your face was in reality &s;o ugly, it would have frightened you.</P>
<P>Indeed! &s;aid Francis. Is it po&s;&s;ible that I re&s;embled &s;uch an odious bea&s;t? I could not but have been extremely frightful if I did, and mu&s;t endeavour for the future to be never in a pa&s;&s;ion. When I find my&s;elf growing angry, I will then bethink me of the monkey, recollect the ma|lice in his countenance, and that will make me &s;hudder at the thought of being like him. Do you too, my good friend Lorenzo, if I forget this re&s;olution, like a friend remind me of it.</P>
<P>Lorenzo a&s;&s;ured him that he would do &s;o, and was faithful to his promi&s;e. Francis by degrees got rid en|tirely of his wrathful habit, or was very rarely in a pa&s;|&s;ion. He enjoyed the greater happine&s;s, and his indulgent parents were not le&s;s tran&s;ported at his reformation.</P>

<P>THE &s;un was ri&s;ing in the heavens. The dew drops which are &s;een on every leaf &s;o early in the morning, glittered with the colours of the rainbow; and the &s;hadows of the trees were &s;hortening on the ground, when Damon, holding his &s;on, a grown-up lad, by the hand, came out, and &s;at down on his garden terrace, to enjoy the fre&s;hne&s;s of the morning.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t father, &s;aid the &s;on, pray wake me always at this hour; for I am charmed with contemplating &s;uch a &s;cene as I now &s;ee all round me! How delightful the whole pro&s;pect! But perhaps it would be more &s;o, were it not confined by younder mountains, which lift up their &s;nowy tops &s;o high that any one would &s;uppo&s;e them to prop the clouds above them.</P>
<P>I do not think as you do, &s;aid the father. Tho&s;e &s;ame mountains leave us &s;pace enough, and <HI>that</HI> made up of
<PB N="108" REF="114">fields and meadows, to contemplate; and by thus con&s;in|ing, as you &s;ay, the pro&s;pect, help to vary it; and more particularly &s;o at evening, when the &s;un &s;till tips them with a thou&s;and &s;treaks of gold, even after the whole level plain is dark.</P>
<P>When we &s;hall once have vi&s;ited tho&s;e mountains, and con&s;idered its inhabitants, you will be plea&s;ed with con|templating on them, I am certain, &s;ince they cannot but &s;ugge&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>How can men, &s;aid the youth, be fond of living on &s;uch mountains, covered as they are with &s;now?</P>
<P>They do not live there, &s;aid Damon; you will &s;eek in vain to find inhabitants upon the heights: it is at the bot|tom of the mountains that they are &s;ituated. There are charming vallies &s;tretched among them; but before the traveller can obtain them, he di&s;cerns no pro&s;pect &s;ave that of barren rocks. This pro&s;pect being pa&s;&s;ed, he comes to wide extended carpets of the greene&s;t &s;od; he breathes an air embalmed on all &s;ides by ten thou&s;and odoriferous flowers that grow there; and his ear is plea&s;ingly affected by the murmurs of as many &s;treams de&s;cending from the &s;ummit of the hills. The &s;un, by &s;hining on them with his noon day radiance, makes them put on the appearance of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighte&s;t &s;ilver. And among&s;t them, &s;ome, preci|pitated from a rock, re-echo when they reach the bottom, and <HI>there</HI> ri&s;e in clouds, as one may &s;ay, of du&s;t, that yield a trembling kind of light. Their pa&s;&s;age is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a multitude of charming flowers which blo&s;&s;om on the margin; and the flowers, who&s;e &s;talks wave to and fro, obedient to the breeze that agitates them, and the waters that flow in among them, heighten the delightful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Spring is very late, and harve&s;t very early, in this re|gion; whence it happens that the ground brings forth no other &s;ort of grain than what is &s;owed &s;ome little while before the &s;ummer, and grows ripe betimes in autumn: hence, too, it comes that the fields are &s;haded by no other trees than tho&s;e producing cherries, plums, and other early fruit. Here and there the traveller meets with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets; and the hou&s;es being made of wood, are &s;o much blackened by the &s;un, as to afford a very &s;triking contra&s;t with the &s;miling verdure of the little orchards that &s;urround them.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">In tho&s;e hamlets live many innocent and happy families, which for the &s;pace of five or &s;ix long months are almo&s;t buried under &s;now. As long as that &s;ad &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts, they take the greate&s;t care imaginable of their little flocks; at times they vi&s;it one another, &s;pin the flax which they have gathered before hand, and make different articles of furniture in wood, which they either u&s;e them&s;elves, or are &s;ure to fell for money to their neighbours.</P>
<P>As &s;oon towards &s;ummer as the &s;un has melted that va&s;t heap of &s;now which covered all their fields and habi|tations, and the river that flows through their vallies has completely carried off the water with which their lands were overflowed, all the men begin to cultivate their fields or meadows, and the women labour in their gardens. During &s;ummer, the indu&s;trious father of his family re|pairs to other di&s;tricts with the produce of his labours, and brings back, in barter for them, tho&s;e conveniencies of life which are not to be had for money even in his hamlet.</P>
<P>Many travel upon mules, and cro&s;s their craggy hills along &s;uch paths as have been cut through rocks, and tho&s;e, too, over frightful precipices. They tran&s;port to very di&s;tant parts the honey which they have &s;tored in autumn, which is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be excel|lent. They likewi&s;e traffic in the &s;kins of goats, which they entrap while climbing up the rocks, or find among them dead. Another article of merchandize for which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed, is the dormou&s;e. This animal, benumbed by the exce&s;&s;ive cold, retains in holes and cavi|ties, which &s;he digs for her&s;elf to &s;erve by way of habita|tion, and in which &s;he lies rolled up almo&s;t like a ball and on a bed of hay, that heat and life which, with returning &s;pring, the &s;un expands; and a fourth great object of their commerce is the cry&s;tal, which they contrive to quarry in the gaps or cha&s;ms of their highe&s;t rocks. And many, on the other hand, are guides to foreigners who have the curio&s;ity to travel over, and in&s;pect their frozen moun|tains.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf have been upon them, like many others, guided in my way by one of tho&s;e good men.&mdash;I call them good, in oppo&s;ition to the multitudes that live in towns and civilized &s;ociety.&mdash;But yet they have lo&s;t a great deal of their natural &s;implicity by frequent conver&s;e with &s;uch
<PB N="110" REF="116">foreigners as have employed them for guides. I admired the people, and their way of living; therefore, having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity upon the mountains, I determined to remain among them &s;ome few days, that I might gain a better knowledge of their manners.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t let you know what conver&s;ation I heard pa&s;s be|tween the wife and child of <HI>my</HI> conductor while I lived among them.

<P>Yes, yes; I &s;ee him too. What ra&s;hne&s;s! He might &s;lip in &s;pringing, or when over; or he might not po&s;&s;ibly &s;pring far enough, and drop into the gap. He does not take a &s;ingle &s;tep but what he knows, as well as I do, makes my heart &s;ink within me. He &s;hould think that it is not impo&s;&s;ible but I may &s;ee him; he &s;hould argue within him&s;elf, and &s;ay, My wife <HI>does</HI> &s;ee me, and my danger frights her.</P>

<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot. I had rather tremble every mo|ment for his &s;afety, than lo&s;e &s;ight of him, though for a moment only. But where is he? I can &s;ee him now no longer.</P>

<P>My poor child! embrace me. We are now left to our&s;elves, and I have nothing in the world to com|fort me but you. Yes, they have di&s;appeared indeed; and in a moment too! I did but turn away my eyes to fix them upon you, and in that in&s;tant they are vani&s;hed! An aby&s;s perhaps has opened under them as they were going on: perhaps they may be to&s;&s;ing in it, not yet dead, but making unavailing efforts to get out, and calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance with a voice which no one, to their co&s;t, is nigh enough to hear. I will ha&s;ten to the &s;pot: come, follow me, my child! My knees knock one again&s;t another, and will hardly bear my body up; but I &s;hall &s;oon find &s;trength &s;ufficient to go forward. Come; but &s;tay a little!

<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; we &s;hould do as much; but they, on the other hand, &s;eem rich; and I have often heard that &s;uch de&s;pi&s;e the poor.</P>

<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not all; and then, too, they are men, and mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of people's mi&s;ery like others. Would not you &s;tretch forth a hand to help your little dog, were he in danger? Would you leave him una&s;&s;i&s;ited?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed: but why? becau&s;e I love him: and do rich men love the poor? I have had money given me by one rich man to fight my play-mate.&mdash;Ah! I think I &s;ee my father now; yes, there he is! yes, yes, indeed; and, as you &s;aid, behind the gentlemen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I &s;ee him too. Thank God! But &s;till my heart beats grievou&s;ly. I am in a tremble: So let us both &s;it down; we will have our eyes fixed on them till they are &s;afe on this &s;ide of the valley; and by that time, as I hope, my agitation will be calmed. Me|thinks they come on very quick. No doubt they wi&s;h to end their journey before day &s;huts in.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mother, I can &s;ee no longer through the &s;pying-gla&s;s, becau&s;e I cry; and yet I cannot take away my eyes. But now I &s;ee again. Yes, there they are, and they have cleared the precipice, quite cleared it. They are out of danger now: I &s;ee them: they turn back to view the rock under which they have pa&s;&s;ed, perhaps, without knowing at the time what peril they encountered. They lift their arms up; they are talking to each other; they are looking at &s;ome object that a&s;tounds them.</P>

<P>They are out of danger; that is enough for me. I &s;ee them: they have nothing now but level ground remaining. Ki&s;s me, my dear child! and let us both pa&s;s on to meet your father. But at no time in my life &s;hall I forget what I have felt this afternoon. Let us make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and beg that he would no more thus venture into danger. We &s;hall have the little field, in that ca&s;e, &s;omewhat later; or it may be not at all; and it is no matter. We have lived till now without it: our enjoyments have not been on that account the le&s;s; we have in &s;hort been happy, and what more can we de&s;ire? I &s;hall not for the future know that he is returning to tho&s;e frozen regions, without fearing every danger that I know, and &s;uch as I can but gue&s;s. He may, perhaps, be &s;afe feated at his ea&s;e beneath a tree; but I &s;hall fancy that I behold him &s;truggling in a gap, and &s;triving to get out. Whatever money he receives from tho&s;e whom he may conduct,&mdash;if he but loves us, he &s;hould think that he buys it at a price too dear.</P>
</SP>
<P>The mother and the &s;on upon this went forward, and I followed them till they had gained the valley. They pre&s;&s;ed on to meet a hu&s;band, and a father; and at la&s;t, when they ob&s;erved him with the Engli&s;hmen draw near, they dur&s;t not note him. They &s;at down together, let

It was not before they reached their cottage, that the wife and &s;on ran both to Julian, and together &s;unk into his arms. The &s;on related every thing which they had both &s;een and feared. The mother did not &s;peak at fir&s;t; but when &s;he &s;aw her hu&s;band touched by the affectionate behaviour of his &s;on, &s;he once again embraced him and &s;hed tears. He promi&s;ed that he would never more af|fright her by returning to the ice, but cultivate his field in peace.</P>

<HEAD>THE THREE CAKES.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gla&s;&s;ington.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE was a little boy named Henry, about your age. His pa|rents had but lately fixed him at a boarding-&s;chool. He was a &s;pecial boy, for ever at his book, and happened once to get the highe&s;t place at exerci&s;es. His mama was told it. She could no how keep from dreaming of the plea&s;ure; and when morning came, &s;he got up early, &s;ent to &s;peak with the cook, and &s;aid as follows: Cook, you are to make a cake for Henry, who ye&s;terday was very
<PB N="117" REF="123">good at &s;chool. With all my heart, replied the cook, and &s;et immediately about it. It was as big as&mdash;let me &s;ee,&mdash;as big as&mdash;as a hat when flapped. The cook had &s;tuffed it with nice almonds, large Pi&s;tachio nuts, and candied lemon-peel, and iced it over with a coat of &s;ugar, &s;o that it was very &s;mooth, and of a perfect white. The cake no &s;ooner was come home from baking, than the cook put on her things, and carried it to &s;chool. When Henry fir&s;t &s;aw it, he jumped up and down like any Merry An|drew. He was not &s;o patient as to wait 'till they could let him have a knife, but fell upon it tooth and nail.&mdash; He ate and ate 'till &s;chool began, and after &s;chool was over he ate again: at night too it was the &s;ame thing 'till bed-time. Nay, a little fellow that Henry had for a play|mate, told me that he put the cake upon his bol&s;ter when he went to bed, and waked and waked a dozen times, that he might take a bit. I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily believe this la&s;t particular; but then it is very true, at lea&s;t, that on the morrow, when the day was hardly broke, he &s;et about his favourite bu&s;ine&s;s once again, continuing at it all the morn|ing, and by noon had ate it up. The dinner bell now rung, but Henry, as one may fancy, had no &s;tomach, and was vexed to &s;ee how heartily the other children ate. It was, however, wor&s;e than this at five o'clock, when &s;chool was over. His companions a&s;ked him if he would not play at cricket, taw, or kites. Alas! he could not; &s;o they played without him. In the mean time Henry could hardly &s;tand upon his legs; he went and &s;at down in a corner very gloomy, while the children &s;aid one to another, What is the matter with poor Henry, who u&s;ed to &s;kip about, and be &s;o merry? See how pale and &s;or|rowful he is! The ma&s;ter came him&s;elf, and &s;eeing him, was quite alarmed. It was all lo&s;t labour to interrogate him. Henry could not be brought to &s;peak a &s;ingle word. By great good luck, a boy at length came forward in the &s;ecret; and his information was, that Henry's mama had &s;ent him a great cake the day before, which he had &s;wal|lowed in an in&s;tant as it were, and that his pre&s;ent &s;ick|ne&s;s was occa&s;ioned only by his gluttony. On this, the ma&s;ter &s;ent for an apothecary, who &s;oon ordered him a quantity of phy&s;ic, phial after phial. Henry, as one would fancy, found it very nau&s;eous, but was forced to take the whole for fear of dying; which, had he omitted
<PB N="118" REF="124">it, would certainly have been the ca&s;e. When &s;ome few days of phy&s;ic and &s;trict regimen had pa&s;&s;ed, his health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed as before; but his mama prote&s;ted that &s;he would never let him have another cake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did not merit &s;o much as the &s;mell of &s;uch a thing. But this is but one cake, papa; and you in|formed me that there were three, if you remember, in your &s;tory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gla&s;&s;ington.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience! patience! here is another cake in what I am now going to tell.</P>
<P>Henry's ma&s;ter had another &s;cholar who&s;e name was Francis. He had written his mama a very pretty letter, and it had not &s;o much as a blotted &s;troke; in recompence for which &s;he &s;ent him likewi&s;e a great cake, and Francis thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: I will not, like that glutton Henry, eat up my cake at once, and &s;o be fick as he was: no, I will make my plea&s;ure la&s;t a great deal longer. So he took the cake, which he could hardly lift by rea&s;on of its weight, and watched the opportunity of &s;lipping up into his chamber with it, where his box was, and in which he put it under lock and key. At play-time every day he &s;lipped away from his companions, went up &s;tairs a tip-toe, cut a tolerable &s;lice off, &s;wallowed it, put by the re&s;t, and then came down and mixed again with his com|panions. He continued this clande&s;tine bu&s;ine&s;s all the week; and even then the cake was hardly half con&s;umed. But what en&s;ued? At la&s;t the cake grew dry, and quickly after mouldy; nay, the very maggots got into it, and by that means had their &s;hare; on which account it was not then worth eating, and our young curmudgeon was com|pelled to fling the re&s;t away with great reluctance. How|ever, no one grieved for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percival.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; nor I, papa. What, keep a cake locked up &s;even days together, and not give one's friend a bit! That is mon&s;trous! But let us have the other now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gla&s;&s;ington.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was another little gentleman who went to &s;chool with Henry and Francis likewi&s;e, and his name was Gratian. His mama &s;ent <HI>him</HI> a cake one day, becau&s;e &s;he loved him, and indeed he loved her al&s;o very much. It was no &s;ooner come, than Gratian thus addre&s;&s;ed his young companions: Come and look at what mama has &s;ent me; you mu&s;t every one eat with me.
<PB N="119" REF="125">They &s;carce needed &s;uch a welcome piece of information twice, but all got round the cake, as you have doubtle&s;s &s;een the bees re&s;orting to a flower ju&s;t blow. As Gra|tian was provided with a knife, he cut a great piece off, and then divided it into as many &s;hares as he had brought boys together by &s;uch a courteous invitation. Upon this he ranged them in a circle, and beginning with the boy who then &s;tood next him, he went round, di&s;tributing to each his portion, 'till the &s;hares were all di&s;po&s;ed of in this manner. Gratian then took up the re&s;t, and told them that he would eat his piece next day; on which he put it up, and went to play with his companions who were all &s;olicitous to have him chu&s;e whatever game he thought might entertain him mo&s;t.</P>
<P>A quarter of an hour had &s;carcely pa&s;t as they were playing, when a poor old man, who had a fiddle, came into the yard. He had a very long white beard, and being blind, was guided by a little dog who went before him with a collar round his neck. To this a cord was fa&s;tened, which the poor blind man held in his hand. It was noticed with how much dexterity the little dog con|ducted him, and how he &s;hook a bell which, I forgot to &s;ay, hung underneath his collar, when he came near any one, as if he had de&s;igned to &s;ay by &s;uch an action, Do not throw down or run again&s;t my ma&s;ter. Being come into the yard, he &s;at him down upon a &s;tone, and hearing &s;everal children talking round him, May dear little gen|tlemen, &s;aid he, I will play you all the pretty tunes that I know, if you will give me leave. The children wi&s;hed for nothing half &s;o much. He put his violin in tune, and then thrummed over &s;everal jigs, and other &s;craps of mu&s;ic, which it was ea&s;y to conjecture had been new in former times. Little Gratian &s;aw that while he played his merrie&s;t airs, a tear would now and then roll down his cheeks, on which he &s;tooped to a&s;k him why he wept? Becau&s;e, &s;aid the mu&s;ician, I am very hungry. I have no one in the world that will give my dog or me a bit of any thing to eat. I wi&s;h I could but work, and get for both of us a mor&s;el of &s;omething, but I have lo&s;t my &s;trength and &s;ight. Alas! I laboured hard till I was old, and now I want bread. The generous Gratian hearing this, wept too. He did not &s;ay a word; but ran to fetch the cake which he had de&s;igned to eat him&s;elf. He
<PB N="120" REF="126">brought it out with joy, and as he ran along, began. Here, good old man, here is &s;ome cake for you. Where? replied the poor mu&s;ician, feeling with his hands; where is it! for I am blind, and cannot &s;ee you. Gratian put the cake into his hand, when laying down his fiddle on the ground, he wiped his eyes, and then began to eat. At every piece he put into his mouth, he gave his faithful little dog a bit, who came and ate out of his hand; and Gratian, &s;tanding by him, &s;miled with plea|&s;ure at the thought of having fed the poor old man when he was hungry.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUN AND MOON.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a charming evening! Come, Alexis, &s;aid Mr. Wilmot to his little boy; the &s;un is ju&s;t ready to go down. How glorious he appears! We may behold him now. He does not dazzle us &s;o much at pre&s;ent as he did at noon, when he was up &s;o very high. How beautiful, too, the clouds &s;eem round about him! They are of a purple, gold and &s;carlet colour! But behold how &s;wiftly he de&s;cends! Already only half his orb is vi&s;ible. And now he is wholly vani&s;hed. Rarewell &s;un; you have left us for the pre&s;ent till to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>Look, Alexis, towards that quarter of the heavens ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to where the &s;un de&s;cended. What may that be &s;hining &s;o behind the trees? a fire? No, nothing like it, but the moon. How large and red it is! One would &s;up|po&s;e it full of blood! This evening it is quite round, on as they &s;ay, full moon. It will not be quite &s;o round to|morrow evening; le&s;s &s;o the next evening; le&s;s the even|ing after; and &s;o on, decrea&s;ing &s;omething every evening, till at la&s;t it will be in &s;ome &s;ort like a wire bent round into a &s;emicircle, when a fortnight is gone.</P>
<P>It will then be new moon, and from day to day you will ob&s;erve it afterward grow bigger, and &s;eem rounder, till in fourteen days more it will be again full moon, and ri&s;e as it does now behind the trees.</P>
<P>But pray, papa, inform me, how do both the &s;un and moon pre&s;erve their &s;ituations un&s;upported in the air? I always fear they cannot but fall down upon my head.</P>
<P>Fear nothing, dear Alexis: there is no danger. I will explain the rea&s;on why, when you can under&s;tand the matter; &s;o at pre&s;ent only li&s;ten while I mention how the &s;un and moon addre&s;s you.</P>
<P>To begin then with the &s;un: He &s;ays as follows: I am King of day. I ri&s;e, or make my fir&s;t appearance in the Ea&s;t; and what they call Aurora, or the dawn, precedes me, that mankind may know of my approach. I tap &s;oon after at your window with a golden beam of light, to warn you of my pre&s;ence. Ri&s;e, I &s;ay, ri&s;e lazy-boots.
<PB N="124" REF="130">I never &s;hine, that men may lie a bed and &s;nore. I &s;hine that they may wake, get up, aad go to work.</P>
<P>I am the mighty traveller; and I run rejoicing like a giant, quite acro&s;s the heavens, without ever &s;topping; for at no time am I weary.</P>
<P>I have a crown of glorious radiance on my head. I &s;hed this radiance round about me to a va&s;t extent, and even over half the univer&s;e. Wherever I am pre&s;ent, all things are beautiful and bright.</P>
<P>I give heat too, as well as light. It is I who ripen with my beams the fruit in gardens, and the corn that grows in fields. If I &s;hould cea&s;e a moment to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cour&s;e of nature, nothing then could grow, and fami&s;hed men would die of de&s;pair, in all the horrors of that darkne&s;s which you your&s;elf dread &s;o much.</P>
<P>I am higher than the hills and clouds. I &s;hould but need to come down a little towards the earth, and my de|vouring flame would burn it up as &s;oon as you have &s;een the &s;traw con&s;umed which men to&s;s in bundles into a furnace.</P>
<P>What a length of time has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince fir&s;t I gladdened the whole univer&s;e! Alexis, you were hardly in the world &s;ix years ago, but I was. I was in it when your dear papa was born, and many thou&s;and years before; and I am not grown old yet.</P>
<P>At times I lay a&s;ide my crown of radiance, and &s;ur|round my head with &s;ilver clouds. It is not &s;o difficult to view me then; but when I di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e clouds about me, and bur&s;t forth in all my noon-day &s;plendor, you could never bear the blaze: &s;hould you attempt to bear it, I &s;hould blind you. There is but one living creature that can look at me, and that living creature is the eagle, whom the birds confe&s;s their monarch. He can contem|plate my glory with a &s;teady eye wide open, while he views me.</P>
<P>This &s;ame eagle, darting from the &s;ummit of &s;ome ele|vated mountain, &s;hapes his progre&s;s towards me with a towering wing, and &s;oon is lo&s;t amid my beams, through which he darts to pay me homage every minute of the day. The lark, &s;u&s;pended in the air a great deal lower, &s;ings, while I am ri&s;ing, his be&s;t &s;ong, and wakes the other bird, that &s;lumber in ten thou&s;and trees. The cork,
<PB N="125" REF="131">remaining on the ground, proclaims the time of my return to mortals with a piercing voice. But, on the other hand, the bat and owl avoid my pre&s;ence: they fly from me with a plaintive cry, and ha&s;ten to take refuge in the ruins of tho&s;e towers which I once &s;aw proudly ri&s;ing, do|mineering afterward for many ages over &s;pacious countries, and then finking with the burthen of old age.</P>
<P>My empire is not limited, like that of earthly monarchs, to a corner of the world. The univer&s;e at large is my dominion; and be&s;ides, I am the mo&s;t illu&s;trious object that was ever gazed at.</P>
<P>But the moon &s;ays, in the next place, with a voice not half &s;o much exalted as the &s;un's, I am the queen of night. I &s;end my &s;ilver beams to give you light, as often as the &s;un withdraws at evening from the world.</P>
<P>You may keep looking at me without danger; for I am never &s;o re&s;plendent as to dazzle the &s;pectator, much le&s;s do I burn. I am &s;o good natured that I let poor glow|worms blaze among the hedges, which the &s;un, unpitying as he is, will not.</P>
<P>The &s;tars &s;hine round about me; but I my&s;elf am far more luminous than any &s;tar: nay, all the &s;tars together give not &s;o much light as I do: and I &s;eem among their multitude as if I were a fair round pearl, &s;urrounded by ten thou&s;and little diamonds.</P>
<P>When you lie a&s;leep, I dart a beam of &s;ilver brightne&s;s through your curtains; and my words are, Sleep on, lit|tle friend, in &s;afety. You are tired. I will not di&s;turb your &s;lumber.</P>
<P>You have heard the nightingale. <HI>She</HI> &s;ings for me, who &s;ings much better than all other birds. She perches on a &s;pray, and fills the fore&s;t with her mu&s;ic, no le&s;s &s;weet and gentle than my brightne&s;s, while the dew de|&s;cends on every flower, and all is calm and &s;ilent in my empire.</P>

<P>WHO will give me &s;ome nice tree or other for my garden? &s;aid little Frederic one day to his bro|thers Augu&s;tus and Ja&s;per, and his &s;i&s;ter Jemima.</P>
<P>(Their papa had given them each a little bit of ground to &s;ew or plant, as they thought proper.)</P>

<P>Come then, &s;aid the lively Jemima, come and chu&s;e one for your&s;elf. On which &s;he led him to a little &s;pot of ground that &s;he cultivated; and the moment they had en|tered, pointing with her finger to a charming ro&s;e-bu&s;h, told him he had nothing el&s;e to do, than take it up im|mediately.</P>

<P>How, &s;i&s;ter! you have only two, and wi&s;h be|&s;ides to give me up the fine&s;t! No, no; here is the lea&s;t, and ju&s;t &s;uch as I want.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jemima.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not know how much plea&s;ure I &s;hall feel, if you will but take the other, Frederic. This may &s;carce produce you any flowers next &s;ummer; but the other will, I am certain: and you know, I &s;hall be plea&s;ed as much with looking at it el&s;ewhere, when full blown, as if it had continued in my garden.</P>
<P>Frederic overjoyed, approached the ro&s;e-bu&s;h, took it up; and Jemima, much more plea&s;ed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the tran&s;plantation.</P>
<P>It appears that the gardener noticed this &s;urpri&s;ing piece of kindne&s;s in the little girl. Away he ran, &s;elected from a number of young Wind&s;or pear-trees, one which he thought the fine&s;t, and immediately conveyed it into Je|mima's garden, planting it exactly in the &s;pot which the ro&s;e-bu&s;h had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have a churli&s;h nature hardly ever are a&s;&s;i|duous: therefore when the &s;ummer months were come, Ja&s;per and his brother having never attended their ro&s;e
<PB N="127" REF="133">plants, they promi&s;ed no great quantity of flowers; and to increa&s;e their di&s;appointment, the chief part of tho&s;e which they thought were coming, peri&s;hed in the bud; while on the contrary Frederic's ro&s;e-bu&s;h, in con&s;equence of great attention paid it by him&s;elf and Jemima, bore the fine&s;t centfoil ro&s;es that the whole county could boa&s;t; and as long as it remained in flower, the happy Frederic always had a ro&s;e to &s;tick in Jemima's bo&s;om, and another for him&s;elf to &s;mell.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e did the Wind&s;or pear-tree thrive &s;urpri&s;ingly: it &s;cattered a delicious perfume over all the garden, and &s;oon grew &s;o thick and lofty as to yield a tolerable um|brage. Jemima u&s;ed to come and take her &s;eat beneath it, when the &s;un was hotte&s;t; as her father al&s;o did, when he would tell her charming &s;tories, &s;ome of which would make her all at once bur&s;t out a laughing till her &s;ides even ached again; and others produced &s;uch agreeable melancholy in her, that &s;oon after &s;he would &s;mile with plea&s;ure at the recollection of her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Here is one that he told her for her genero&s;ity towards Frederic; by which &s;tory &s;he was thoroughly convinced that &s;uch as we oblige can recompence our genero&s;ity; which circum&s;tance, he &s;aid, without adverting to the &s;a|tisfaction of our hearts, mu&s;t be a &s;trong incentive to kind actions.</P>

<HEAD>THE NOSEGAYS.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Gerald went out one morning with his neighbour Eugene, to divert them&s;elves by gather|ing flowers. Their eagerne&s;s would not allow them to di&s;patch their breakfa&s;t in the hou&s;e: they took it with them in their hands.</P>
<P>They met a beggar-woman in the way, who had a child apparently expiring, as it were, with hunger.</P>
<P>My dear little ma&s;ter, &s;aid the woman, looking upon Gerald, who happened to be fir&s;t, for heaven's &s;ake give my child a mor&s;el of your bread. He has not had a bit of any thing to eat &s;ince ye&s;terday.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="134">It may be &s;o, &s;aid Gerald; but I am very hungry like|wi&s;e, and went forward, munching all the way.</P>
<P>Now what was Eugene's conduct? He was no le&s;s hun|gry, we mu&s;t think, than his companion; but beholding how the poor child cried, he gave up his bread and but|ter; and received a hundred ble&s;&s;ings which God heard in heaven.</P>
<P>But this is not the whole. The little boy, revived by what the charitable Eugene had be&s;towed upon him, in|&s;tantly began to run before his benefactor, brought him to a meadow, where he knew there was a multitude of flowers, and helped to make up &s;o magnificent a bow-pot, that the plea&s;ant &s;mell proceeding from it made him quite forget his trouble.</P>
<P>Eugene, after this, went home and &s;hewed it with a deal of plea&s;ure; for not only was the &s;weetne&s;s of it very grateful, but its &s;ize was &s;uch that he might ea&s;ily have hid his face behind it.</P>
<P>Next day likewi&s;e they went out, and then another little boy, who&s;e name was Watty, met them.</P>
<P>After having taken half a dozen turns with Gerald and Eugene in the meadow, Watty, looking down, perceived his buckle lo&s;t, and begged them both to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;earching for it. Oh, &s;ays Gerald, I cannot &s;pare time enough for that at pre&s;ent, and went on; but Eugene &s;topped immediately, that he might be of &s;ervice to his little friend.</P>
<P>He walked a long while up and down, both &s;tooping all the way, and patting with his hand, to try if he could feel it in the gra&s;s: and had at la&s;t the happine&s;s to find it.</P>
<P>Watty too was happy; and they &s;et about the bu&s;ine&s;s which had brought them thither.</P>
<P>Watty, out of gratitude, be&s;towed the fine&s;t flowers of tho&s;e which he had gathered, upon Eugene; but paid no regard to Gerald, who had refu&s;ed to help him; &s;o that Eugene had that day al&s;o, a finer bow-pot than Gerald, and came back as &s;atisfied as he was di&s;contented.</P>
<P>Gerald &s;uppo&s;ed the third day he might prove more lucky: He preceded Eugene, and defied him to collect a finer bow-pot than he &s;hould. But hardly were they come into the meadow, when behold the little boy who had
<PB N="129" REF="135">been fed by Eugene, came to meet him with a ba&s;ket full of flowers which, it &s;eems, he had gathered that morning.</P>
<P>Gerald would have begun to gather for him&s;elf; but how was he to find the flowers? The little boy had got up earlier by a deal than he; and therefore he had &s;till le&s;s flowers that day than either of the two preceding.</P>
<P>They were going home, but met little Watty.</P>
<P>My dear friend, &s;aid he to Eugene, I have not forgot the &s;ervice that you did me ye&s;terday, and have taken &s;uch a liking to you, that I could wi&s;h to be at all times in your company. Papa too, though he never &s;aw you, has the &s;ame ideas in your favour, and has bid me come and fetch you to his hou&s;e this morning: He de&s;igns to tell us merry &s;tories, and afterwards will play with us.</P>
<P>I will take you to a garden here hard by us, where we are allowed to walk, and there you will find four or five companions of my age to welcome you; when we are all together we will play at whatever game you like.</P>
<P>Eugene in&s;tantly laid hold of Watty's hand, and flew like lightning with him towards the garden. As for Ge|rald, poor fellow! he went home quite melancholy. Watty had not once invited him.</P>
<P>He learned by the&s;e three days adventures, but parti|cularly by the la&s;t, how much one gains by kindne&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance granted to others. He reformed his churli&s;h temper; and would certainly, in time, have &s;hown him|&s;elf as courteous to the full as Eugene, if this la&s;t, by having exerci&s;ed a friendly di&s;po&s;ition from his cradle, had not conferred his favours with a greater grace.</P>

<P>Hearing this, the little lady ki&s;&s;ed her mother's hand with ardour, and immediately ran off to make up half a dozen artificial ro&s;es, with a crim&s;on ribbon which &s;he had by her.

<HEAD>THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER.</HEAD>
<P>A Silly &s;ervant maid had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the imagination of her ma&s;ter's children with a hundred fooli&s;h tales of &s;pirits, and particularly of a black-faced goblin, as &s;he called it.</P>
<P>Antonia, one of the&s;e poor children, for the fir&s;t time in her life, beheld a chimney-&s;weeper knocking at her father's door. She made a lamentable outcry, and betook her&s;elf for refuge to the fir&s;t apartment that &s;he found open, which apartment was the kitchen.</P>
<P>Hardly had &s;he hid her&s;elf behind a table, when the black-faced man came in, as if, in her imagination, he had meant to follow her.</P>
<P>This frightened her a &s;econd time; and up &s;he ran into a pantry, higher than the kitchen floor by half a dozen &s;teps, and not a great way from the fire place: where &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould be &s;afe from danger, in a corner.</P>
<P>She had hardly come, however, to her&s;elf, when &s;ud|denly &s;he heard the frightful fellow &s;inging in the chim|ney; and, with bru&s;h and &s;craper, making all the while a rattling noi&s;e again&s;t the bricks about him.</P>
<P>Being &s;eized with terror, &s;he jumped up, and leaping through a window, which was rather low, into the garden, ran quite breathle&s;s towards an arbour at the bottom of it, where &s;he fell half dead, and almo&s;t void of motion, clo&s;e be&s;ide a tree.</P>
<P>Though &s;he had changed her &s;ituation by &s;o great a di&s;tance, yet hardly did &s;he venture to look about her; when by chance &s;he &s;aw the black-faced man appear again, and wave his bru&s;h about him, at the chimney-top.</P>
<P>On this, Antonia almo&s;t &s;plit her throat with crying out, Help! help!</P>
<P>Her father heard the cry, and running towards the arbour, a&s;ked what ailed her, that &s;he cried out &s;o! An|tonia had not &s;trength &s;ufficient to articulate a &s;ingle word, and therefore, keeping &s;ilence, pointed to the place where Grim was then &s;itting a&s;tride, and flouri&s;hing his bru&s;h.</P>
<P>Her father &s;miled; and to convince her what &s;mall cau&s;e &s;he had for terror, waited till the chimney-&s;weeper
<PB N="133" REF="139">was come down. He then bade him be called, and cleaned a little in Antonia's pre&s;ence; after which, with|out explaining matters any further, he &s;ent up into the hou&s;e to fetch his barber, who, it happened, was then waiting for him, and who con&s;equently had his face all over white with powder.</P>
<P>She was heartily a&s;hamed of having feared &s;o much, without occa&s;ion; and her father took this opportunity of giving her to under&s;tand, that there were whole nations, in a certain quarter of the globe, all over black by nature, but not therefore to be dreaded by white children; &s;ince the&s;e la&s;t were, in another country, generally nur&s;ed by women purcha&s;ed of tho&s;e nations, without lo&s;ing any of their whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>Ever afterwards, Antonia was the fir&s;t to laugh at &s;illy &s;tories, told by &s;illy people, of hobgoblins and the like, to fright her.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHERRIES.</HEAD>
<P>JOHANNA and Felix one day got permi&s;&s;ion, from their dear mama, to take a turn or two about the garden, by them&s;elves: they had de&s;erved this confidence placed in them, by their pa&s;t di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>They amu&s;ed them&s;elves, by playing for a time toge|ther, with that decent gaiety by which it is ea&s;y to di&s;|tingui&s;h young children who have been well brought up.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the garden wall grew many fruit-trees, and among them a young cherry-tree, which had no earlier than the year before been grafted, and was now in fruit. Its fruit indeed was very little; but on that account, per|haps much the finer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dutton, their mother, did not want to gather them, though ripe. She kept them for her hu&s;band's eat|ing, who that very day was to return from York where bu&s;ine&s;s had a long time kept him.</P>
<P>As the children were accu&s;tomed to obedience, and for|bidden once for all to gather any kind of fruit, or pick up even &s;uch as they might find upon the ground, to eat
<PB N="134" REF="140">it, without a&s;king leave, &s;he thought it u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay any thing about this cherry-tree.</P>
<P>When Johanna and Felix were fatigued with running up and down the terrace, Come, &s;aid Felix, let us do &s;omething el&s;e now; upon which they joined their hands, and walked &s;edately towards the bottom of the garden, ca&s;ting every now and then a look of appetite upon the fruit with which the e&s;paliers were loaded.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon come up to this late grafted tree. A little bla&s;t of wind had &s;hook the fine&s;t cherries from it, and they lay upon the ground clo&s;e by. Young Felix was the fir&s;t to &s;ee them. He advanced his foot, &s;tooped down, and picked them up, ate &s;ome, and gave Johanna &s;ome, who are them likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>They had not yet flung the &s;tones away, when as it chanced, Johanna recollected her mama's command to eat no fruit but what &s;he might think fit to give her.</P>
<P>Ah! &s;aid &s;he to Felix, we have di&s;obeyed mama by eat|ing any of the&s;e cherries, and &s;hall make her angry with us, when &s;he comes to know it. What had we be&s;t do?</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE PRATER.</HEAD>
<P>LEONORA was endued with &s;pirit and vivacity. When &s;carcely &s;ix years old, &s;he was exceedingly well practi&s;ed in the art of managing her needle, and could very cleverly employ her &s;ci&s;&s;ars. All the garters that her papa and brothers wore were of her making. She could read with ea&s;e in any book that &s;he happened to take up; her writing was al&s;o extremely neat and fair. She did not huddle great and little letters in one word to|gether, neither did they lean &s;ome this and others that way; and her lines went &s;trait along, not dancing up and down from one &s;ide of her paper to the other, as I have too often &s;een in many children's writing-books, even older by a year or two than Leonora.</P>
<P>Her papa too, and mama, were no le&s;s &s;atisfied with her obedience, than her ma&s;ters with her diligence and &s;tudy. She kept up a perfect union with her &s;i&s;ters, treated every &s;ervant with the greate&s;t affability, and her companions with regard and conde&s;cen&s;ion. All her parents' friends,
<PB N="136" REF="142">and every &s;tranger that came there a vi&s;iting, were equally enchanted with her company and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Who would think, that with &s;o many recommendatory qualities, and &s;o much under&s;tanding, any little girl could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o unfortunate that none, when they grew ac|quainted at the hou&s;e, could bear her? Such was Leonora, notwith&s;tanding; for a &s;ingle fault which &s;he had unhap|pily contracted, was &s;o great as to de&s;troy the effect of all her juvenile accompli&s;hments. The intemperance of her tongue made every one forget the graces of her under|&s;tanding, and the goodne&s;s of her heart. In &s;hort, our Leonora was the greate&s;t prater living.</P>
<P>When, for in&s;tance, &s;he was &s;itting down to work, one might have heard her &s;ay, Oho! I fancy, it is high time that I &s;hould be doing &s;omething! What would my mama &s;ay, &s;hould &s;he find me &s;itting with my arms acro&s;s, a lol|ling on my elbows?&mdash;O my &s;tars! how much I have got to hem here? all this apron! But at wor&s;t, I never let the gra&s;s grow under me when I &s;et out, and I &s;hall &s;oon have done. Ah! there the clock &s;trikes: One, two, three, four, five, &s;ix, &s;even, eight, nine&mdash;Yes, po&s;itively nine o'clock! Well then, I have but two poor hours before I go to mu&s;ic; yet a deal of bu&s;ine&s;s may be done in &s;uch a length of time. Mamma, when &s;he ob&s;erves how diligent I have been, will be &s;ure to give me &s;weetmeats.&mdash;Oh! what plea&s;ure I &s;hall have in looking at them! Nothing do I love like nice cri&s;ped almonds. Not that I do not like egg plumbs pre&s;erved: they are very good too, for papa popped one into my mouth la&s;t Thur&s;day, and then gave me a whole bagfull; but I think cri&s;ped almonds better.&mdash;I &s;hould like to &s;ee Mi&s;s Dolly this morning: I would &s;hew her the fine petticoat that mama has bought me. Dolly is a funny little girl enough! I like her va&s;tly. Oh! but &s;he loves talking, and I do not know how it happens, but one cannot thru&s;t a word in when her clap|per is &s;et a going. Where has my thimble hid it&s;elf? Si&s;ter, have you &s;een my thimble? Patty mu&s;t have &s;urely lo&s;t it for me, when &s;he came to &s;weep the parlour.&mdash;It is &s;o like her! &s;he is always &s;uch a hairbrained creature! Who can work without a thimble? at lea&s;t I never take a &s;titch, if I mi&s;lay it; for the needle pricks one's finger, and one's finger bleeds of cour&s;e; and then, be&s;ides the pain it gives one, how one's work looks when it is &s;potted
<PB N="137" REF="143">with red marks! Why, Patty! Patty! where can you be! Have you &s;een my thimble? Oh, no! here it is; and, ju&s;t as if the matter were contrived on purpo&s;e, at the bot|tom of my work-bag.</P>
<P>Thus the little creature would be always dinning peo|ple's ears who happened to be near her. When her pa|rents were engaged in any intere&s;ting conver&s;ation with each other, &s;he would come and mix in their di&s;cour&s;e, by prating upon twenty different &s;ubjects. And at din|ner, &s;he had hardly ever ended with her meat, before the pie or pudding was on the table. She would really forget to eat and drink, while everla&s;tingly employed in prating.</P>
<P>Her papa would frequently reprove her twenty times a day for this defect; but all reproof was lo&s;t upon her, neither would the greate&s;t puni&s;hment produce a reforma|tion in her conduct. As it was not po&s;&s;ible for any one to hear him&s;elf when &s;he was by, Mi&s;s Chatterbox was often &s;ent to pa&s;s the morning all alone in her apartment. Du|ring dinner, they would put her at a little table by her|&s;elf, as di&s;tant from the company as they could place her. Leonora &s;eemed afflicted at this &s;eparation, but was not a whit the more &s;ilent on that account. She had always &s;ome &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, were it even addre&s;&s;ed only to her|&s;elf, and, neverthele&s;s, &s;he talked &s;o loud every word that &s;he &s;aid was heard; for, it was the &s;ame to her if any bo|dy was or was not by her: and I verily believe, that, ra|ther than be mute, &s;he would have entered into conver&s;a|tion with her knife and fork.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a fooli&s;h habit, what advantage did &s;he ob|tain? The &s;tory tells us, only puni&s;hment and hatred. If you &s;hould not be convinced of this by what I have al|ready mentioned, you will certainly be &s;o when you read what follows:</P>
<P>Once upon a time, her parents were invited to go down into the country for a week or fortnight, by a friend. It was in autumn, the weather was extremely fine, and it is not ea&s;y to conceive what great abundance there was then of every kind of fruit, pears, apples, nectarines and peaches.</P>
<P>Leonora thought it was de&s;igned to make her of the party, but &s;tood very much &s;urpri&s;ed when her papa, di|recting both her &s;i&s;ters to get ready for the journey, told
<PB N="138" REF="144">her that &s;he mu&s;t &s;tay at home. She fell a crying, ran to her mama, and &s;aid, My dear mama, what fault have I committed, that papa &s;hould be &s;o angry with me?&mdash; Your papa, &s;he an&s;wered, is not angry with you; but believe me it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to bear your con&s;tant chatter. You would certainly interrupt our plea&s;ure, and the plea&s;ure of the family that we are now going to vi&s;it; and therefore for the future, when|ever we go abroad, we mu&s;t always leave you behind us.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I never &s;peak, then? an&s;wered Leonora.</P>
<P>That, &s;aid her mama, would be no le&s;s a fault than what we wi&s;h to &s;ee you cured of. You are not to be entirely mute; but then you ought to wait 'till you perceive that your turn for &s;peaking is come round, and not ince&s;&s;antly prevent your parents, and as many as have more experience than your&s;elf, from talking. You &s;hould al&s;o take care how you &s;ay whatever comes into your head. When you de&s;ire to be informed of any thing which it is not improper you &s;hould know, you ought to a&s;k in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, and having any thing to tell, you &s;hould, in that ca&s;e, fir&s;t of all reflect within your&s;elf, if tho&s;e about you would or would not like to hear it.</P>
<P>Leonora, thought &s;he could not rea&s;onably call in que&s;|tion this advice, would not have wanted words to ju&s;tify her prating, if &s;he had not heard that moment her papa call out that every thing was ready; and, in fact, the coach was off that very in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Leonora fell a &s;ighing, and with tears pur&s;ued the car|riage 'till her eye no longer could di&s;cern it. When it was wholly out of &s;ight, &s;he went into a corner, and be|gan to weep mo&s;t bitterly. Ah, babbling go&s;&s;ip! &s;aid &s;he, <STAGE>(<HI>now &s;peaking to her&s;elf,</HI>)</STAGE> it is all owing to my long tongue that I have been thus puni&s;hed. I will take care, that for the future it &s;hall never &s;peak a word more than it ought.</P>
<P>Some few days afterwards they returned. Leonora's &s;i&s;ters brought home with them ba&s;kets full of pears and apples. They were both exceedingly well tempered; therefore Leonora would on no account have gone without her &s;hare, but then the tears that &s;he had been &s;hedding
<PB N="139" REF="145">&s;o completely took away her appetite, that it is not to be wondered if &s;he did not wi&s;h for any. She that moment ran to her papa, imploring his pardon for her fault in having forced him, (as &s;he knew,) much again&s;t his will, to puni&s;h her. We have been both unhappy, added &s;he; but for the future I &s;hall take care, and never &s;peak too much.</P>
<P>Her father tenderly embraced and ki&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Leonora was permitted to &s;it down and take her dinner with the re&s;t. She &s;poke very little, but whatever &s;he did &s;ay was full of grace and mode&s;ty. It is true, it co&s;t her very much to check her tongue, which, through impatience and the itch of talking, rolled, if I may &s;ay &s;o, this and that way in her mouth; but on the following day, this work of checking her propen&s;ity towards talking was le&s;s painful, and the next day &s;till le&s;s &s;o. At length the difficulty, by a gradual diminution, was completely done away. At pre&s;ent &s;he has totally got rid of her bad habit, and &s;he figures in &s;ociety with credit to her&s;elf, and plea&s;ure to her friends, who are no longer vexed with what they were accu&s;tomed to entitle, in deri&s;ion, her <HI>ince&s;&s;ant clack.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE SELF-CORRECTED LIAR.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Griffith was now &s;ix years old, and had never yet told a fal&s;ity. He never had committed any fault, and therefore had no need to hide the truth. When any accident befel him, as to break a pane of gla&s;s, or &s;pot his cloaths, he went immediately and told his father, who would be always &s;o good as to forgive him, with a caution that in future he &s;hould be more careful.</P>
<P>Griffith had a cou&s;in, but a very naughty boy, who&s;e name was Robert. Robert came one day to &s;ee him; and Griffith, by way of &s;hewing his attention to his vi&s;itor, made pro|po&s;als for a game at drafts. His cou&s;in eagerly accepted the propo&s;al, on condition that they &s;hould play for &s;ome|thing. Griffith for a little time refu&s;ed, but in the end was wrought upon by Robert, and in hardly more than thirty minutes, all the money which he had been laying up
<PB N="143" REF="149">many weeks from his allowance was compleatly gone. Affected with his lo&s;s, poor Griffith got into a corner, and began to cry, while Robert fell a laughing, and went home in triumph with his &s;poil.</P>
<P>It was not long before poor Griffith's father, who had been from home, returned. He loved the child, and therefore &s;ent to &s;ee him in the parlour. But what ails you? &s;aid he. And what has happened? Sure you have been crying?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Griffith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, becau&s;e my cou&s;in has been here, and made me play with him at drafts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what of that? I &s;ee no harm done yet; for drafts are a diver&s;ion that I have given you leave to take. But po&s;&s;ibly you played for money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Griffith.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! no, no, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you cry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Griffith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I wi&s;hed to &s;how my cou&s;in how much money I had &s;aved to buy my&s;elf a book. Now I had hid it all behind the great &s;tone po&s;t without, and when I put my hand into the hole, it was gone. Some per&s;on, pa&s;&s;ing by the gate, has &s;tolen it.</P>
<P>Griffith's father, &s;ome how or another, fancied this re|cital to be fal&s;e: but did not mention his &s;u&s;picions then. He went that moment to his brother's, and as &s;oon as he &s;aw little Robert, he forced a &s;mile, and began in this manner:</P>
<P>Well, my child, you have been lucky, have not you, to-day?</P>
<P>Oh! yes, &s;aid Robert, very lucky, &s;ir!</P>
<P>And what did you win?</P>
<P>A &s;hilling, &s;aid the nephew.</P>
<P>What, &s;o much? And did he pay you, Robert?</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, uncle. I have it in my pocket.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Griffith had de&s;erved a grievous pu|ni&s;hment, his father thought it not ami&s;s to pardon this, as being his fir&s;t fal&s;ehood; and therefore only told him, with a &s;cornful tone of voice, that &s;ince he knew that he had a liar in his hou&s;e, he would tell all the &s;ervants never to believe him, what&s;oever he &s;hould &s;ay.</P>
<P>Some few days after, Griffith went in turn to vi&s;it Robert, and pulled out a hand&s;ome pencil-ca&s;e which his &s;i&s;ter had be&s;towed him at Chri&s;tmas. Robert wi&s;hed to have it, and in exchange would have been glad to
<PB N="144" REF="150">give him every one of his playthings, his ball, his top, and rackets; but as Griffith, he ob&s;erved, would not part with it, he began to play the bully, put his arms akimbo, and advanced towards him, &s;aid, "The pencil ca&s;e is mine: I lo&s;t it at your hou&s;e, or el&s;e you &s;tole it." Griffith, to no purpo&s;e, earne&s;tly prote&s;t|ed that it was his &s;i&s;ter's pre&s;ent. Robert quickly let him &s;ee that he meant to force it from him; and as Griffith gra&s;ped it with both hands, he clo&s;ed upon him, threw him down, got over him, and with his double fi&s;t &s;o pomelled Griffith in the face that he was forced to yield the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Poor Griffith, being treated in this manner, po&s;ted home, his no&s;e all over blood, and half his hair pulled off &mdash; "Papa, papa, (&s;aid he, as &s;oon as he was come within his father's hearing,) look how I have been u&s;ed! The naughty Robert has this moment robbed me of my pencil-ca&s;e, and handled me as you &s;ee."</P>
<P>But far from pitying him, his father an&s;wered, "Go, you liar; you have lo&s;t your pencil-ca&s;e at drafts, and to deceive me, &s;meared your no&s;e with mulberry juice, and put your hair into di&s;order." Griffith &s;olemnly prote&s;t|ed, to no purpo&s;e, that he &s;poke only the truth." I can|not credit (&s;aid the father) one who has already proved him&s;elf a liar."</P>
<P>Griffith, quite confounded, went away into his cham|ber, and bewailed mo&s;t bitterly the con&s;equences of his fir&s;t untruth. Next day he begged permi&s;&s;ion to appear before his father, and implored forgivene&s;s. "I acknow|ledge (&s;aid he) how wicked I have been in &s;eeking to deceive you with a fal&s;hood once; but, dear papa, let me entreat you to give up your re&s;olutions of believing me no longer when I even &s;peak the truth!</P>
<P>His father told me the other day that from that moment Griffith had not let the lea&s;t untruth e&s;cape him, and that therefore he had recompenced his &s;on's veracity by tru&s;ting him implicitly. He never looked for prote&s;tations from him: it was &s;ufficient Griffith barely told him any thing, that he &s;hould take it for as great a certainty as if him&s;elf had &s;een it.</P>
<P>What a &s;atisfaction this to be experienced by a tender father, and a &s;on &s;o worthy of him!</P>

<P>Of playing! Never. You &s;hall &s;ee that, mama.</P>
<P>And &s;aying &s;o, the little Laura ran to fetch her play|things. She had got them all together, but was quite alone; for both her &s;i&s;ters were that day to be employed with different ma&s;ters, till the afternoon.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, &s;he played as &s;he thought proper, and was very happy for an hour or thereabout; but, by degrees, the plea&s;ure which &s;he enjoyed began to lo&s;e a little of its power to plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>She had now handled her play-things twenty times, or oftener, and could tell no longer what to do. Her fa|vourite doll was grown quite trouble&s;ome and tedious to her.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired her dear mama to &s;hew her &s;ome new me|thod of diver&s;ion, and to play with her; but unfortunately her mama had very pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s, and could not attend to her, however &s;he might wi&s;h to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Laura, after this, &s;at moping in a corner, till her &s;i&s;ters, had quite fini&s;hed with their ma&s;ters, and were now about to take a little recreation. She ran to them in a melan|choly mood, which was as much as mentioning how long their time of &s;tudy had &s;eemed to her, and with what im|patience &s;he had wi&s;hed to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>They propo&s;ed immediately &s;uch games as they &s;up|po&s;ed mo&s;t entertaining, for they loved her greatly: but, alas! all their &s;olicitude was u&s;ele&s;s. Laura could not but complain that every game which they mentioned had already tired her; nay, in her impatience, &s;he even ven|tured to accu&s;e them of con&s;piring with each other to afford her &s;uch diver&s;ion only as they knew would not amu&s;e her. Upon which Mi&s;s Amelia, her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter,
<PB N="146" REF="152">an extremely &s;en&s;ible young lady ten years old, took Laura by the hand, and with a &s;mile began as follows:</P>

If you, by previous &s;tudy and attention, had obtained an appetite for plea&s;ure, you would certainly have been plea&s;ed as ca&s;ily as we are.</P>
<P>Little Laura, who, however young &s;he was, by no means wanted under&s;tanding, was &s;o &s;truck with the&s;e remarks, as to di&s;cern that every one who would be happy &s;hould take care to mix improving exerci&s;e with plea&s;ing recreation.

<HEAD>THE TULIPS.</HEAD>
<P>LUCETTA had &s;een for two &s;ummers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a bed of tulips in her father's garden, which were &s;treaked with the mo&s;t beautiful colours.</P>
<P>Like the fluttering butterfly, &s;he often roved from flower to flower, being &s;truck merely with their beauty, but never reflecting to what they owed their origin.</P>
<P>La&s;t Autumn, &s;he &s;aw her father amu&s;e him&s;elf with digging up the bed and planting tulip roots. Ah! papa, cried &s;he in a whimpering tone, what are you doing? Will you &s;poil all our fine tulip bed &s;o, and in&s;tead of tho&s;e fine flowers that grew there, put na&s;ty onions in it for the kitchen?</P>
<P>Her father an&s;wered her, that he knew what he was about, and he was going to tell her that from tho&s;e onions would come forth new tulips the following year; but
<PB N="147" REF="153">Lucetta interrupted him by her complaints, and would li&s;ten to nothing.</P>
<P>When her father &s;aw that he could not make her under|&s;tand rea&s;on, he left her to pacify her&s;elf, and continued his work while &s;he retired &s;obbing.</P>
<P>During the Winter, as often as the conver&s;ation turned upon flowers, Lucetta &s;ighed, and thought within her&s;elf how great a pity it was that her father had de&s;troyed the fine&s;t ornament of the garden. Winter fini&s;hed its cour&s;e, and Spring came next to &s;weep the &s;now and ice off the ground.</P>
<P>Lucetta had not entered the garden yet. Indeed it would have been difficult to prevail on her to go in, as it was deprived of her favourite flower. One day, how|ever, &s;he entered without thinking. But what were her tran&s;ports of &s;urprize and joy, when &s;he &s;aw the tulip bed &s;till more beautiful than the preceding year! She &s;tood &s;till at fir&s;t, motionle&s;s and &s;ilent with admiration: at length &s;he threw her&s;elf into her father's arms, crying, Ah! dear papa, I thank you for plucking up tho&s;e na&s;ty onions, and for putting in their place tho&s;e &s;weet flowers that I am &s;o fond of.</P>
<P>Yo owe me no thanks, an&s;wered her father; for the&s;e &s;weet flowers that you are &s;o fond of &s;prung from nothing el&s;e but my na&s;ty onions.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tinate Lucetta would not believe a word of it; upon which her father pulled up carefully one of the fine&s;t tulips, together with the bulbous root (re&s;embling an onion) from which the &s;talk grew, and pre&s;ented it to her.</P>
<P>Lucetta, quite confounded, a&s;ked pardon for having been &s;o unrea&s;onable. I pardon you, my dear child, with all my heart, replied her father, provided you ac|knowledge how ea&s;y it is for children to deceive them|&s;elves, when they attempt to judge, after their ignorance, of the actions of people who have had experience.</P>
<P>Oh! yes, papa, an&s;wered Lucetta, I am convinced of that, and therefore for the future &s;hall di&s;tru&s;t my own eyes; and whenever I &s;hall be tempted to &s;uppo&s;e that I know more of the matter than other people, I will think of the Tulips and the Onions.</P>

<HEAD>THE STRAWBERRIES AND CURRANTS.</HEAD>
<P>ALLAN had frequently heard his father &s;ay, that children were without the lea&s;t degree of knowledge touching what was proper for them; and that all the wi&s;|dom which they could po&s;&s;ibly prove them&s;elves to po&s;&s;e&s;s, lay in following the advice of people older than them&s;elves. And yet he never had &s;incerely wi&s;hed to under&s;tand this doctrine, or perhaps, to &s;peak as favourably as the matter will allow, had forgot it.</P>
<P>His indulgent father had allotted him and Pro&s;pero, his brother, a convenient piece of ground, that each might have a little garden, and di&s;play his indu&s;try and know|ledge in the cultivation of it. And not only this, but they had leave to &s;ow whatever &s;eed they thought proper, or to take any tree-root already growing in their father's garden, and tran&s;plant it.</P>
<P>Pro&s;pero remembered the in&s;truction of his father, went to have a little conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject with Ralph the gardener, and began thus: Pray tell me what I ought to &s;ow at pre&s;ent in my garden, and how &s;et about my work?</P>
<P>The gardener gave him &s;everal roots and &s;eeds adapted to the &s;ea&s;on. Pro&s;pero that moment ran and put them in the ground, and Ralph was &s;o kind as to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the work, and to give him &s;ome in&s;truction.</P>
<P>But Allan, &s;eeing Pro&s;pero's docility, &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders. Ralph, not ob&s;erving this contemptuous action, a&s;ked if he &s;hould give him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;truction likewi&s;e?</P>
<P>Yes, replied Allan, I have great occa&s;ion, to be &s;ure, of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;truction, particularly the la&s;t!</P>
<P>On this, he went into his father's garden; and &s;elect|ing for his own, a quantity of flowers, tran&s;planted them immediately. The gardener let him do as he thought fit.</P>
<P>Next morning, when Allan vi&s;ited his garden, all the flowers which he had &s;o lately planted hung their heads like mourners at a funeral, and, as he &s;aw, were dying. He tran&s;planted others from his father's garden, which the morning after he ob&s;erved, with much vexation, were exactly in the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="155">He was very &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted with this &s;ort of work. It was paying very dear, we mu&s;t acknowledge, for the plea&s;ure of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a few flowers. Of cour&s;e he gave it up, and it was not long before his piece of ground was overrun with weeds and thi&s;tles.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of the Spring, as he was looking at his brother's garden, he &s;aw &s;omething red &s;u&s;pended very near the ground, which, on examination, he di&s;cerned to be &s;trawberries, and found to have an exqui&s;ite degree of flavour.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;aid he, if I had planted &s;trawberries in my garden!</P>
<P>Some time after, likewi&s;e, he &s;aw certain little berries of a milk white colour, that hung down in clu&s;ters from the branches of a bu&s;h; upon examination, they were currants, which to look at only was a banquet.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;aid he again, if I had planted currants in my garden!</P>
<P>Eat as many as you like, &s;aid Pro&s;pero, as if they were your own.</P>
<P>It re&s;ted with your&s;elf and no one el&s;e, remarked the gardener, to have had as good; &s;o never for the future treat with &s;corn the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;truction which any one may offer you, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater knowledge and experience than your&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>OBLIGINGNESS AND COMPLAISANCE.</HEAD>
<P>EMILIA, Victoria, Juliet, and Sophia, had a go|verne&s;s who loved them with the fondne&s;s of a mother. This governe&s;s was called Mademoi&s;elle Beaufoy.</P>
<P>Her greate&s;t wi&s;h was, that her pupils &s;hould be virtuous in order to be happy; that a friend&s;hip for each other &s;hould increa&s;e the plea&s;ures of their childhood; and that they &s;hould ta&s;te tho&s;e plea&s;ures without diminution or anxiety.</P>
<P>A kind indulgence, and exact degree of ju&s;tice towards them, were the con&s;tant motives of her conduct, whether &s;he had any thing to pardon, to reward, or puni&s;h in them.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156">She enjoyed, with infinite delight, the plea&s;ing fruits of her in&s;truction and example.</P>
<P>The four little girls began to be the happie&s;t children upon earth. They told each other of their faults, forgave each other, &s;hared together of each other's joys, and could not live without each other.</P>
<P>Alas! by what fatality do children poi&s;on the &s;ource of their own enjoyments, at the very moment when they begin to ta&s;te its charms; and how great is their hap|pine&s;s when they are placed under the eye of a per&s;on endowed with equal prudence and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>It happened, Mademoi&s;elle Beaufoy was forced to leave her pupils for a time, as certain family concerns obliged her to vi&s;it France. She left them with reluctance, made a &s;acrifice of &s;ome advantages to the de&s;ire of quickly &s;ettling her affairs, and hardly had a month expired when &s;he returned in &s;afety to her little flock.</P>
<P>They all received her with the greate&s;t &s;igns of joy: but, alas! what an unhappy alteration did &s;he very &s;oon perceive in the&s;e poor little children!</P>
<P>If, as frequently it happened, any one among them a&s;ked the &s;lighte&s;t favour of another, the latter ill-naturedly refu&s;ed it, and hence followed di&s;content and quarrels:&mdash; the uncommon gaiety that hitherto had been remarkable in all their little &s;ports, and made their work it&s;elf delight|ful, was now changed to peevi&s;hne&s;s and melancholy; and in&s;tead of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions dictated by peace and friend&s;hip, which were before heard in all their conver&s;a|tions, nothing now prevailed among them but ince&s;&s;ant bickerings. Did either wi&s;h to take an hour's diver&s;ion in the garden? her &s;i&s;ters were &s;ure to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome rea&s;on for remaining in their chamber. And, in &s;hort, it was enough that any thing &s;hould meet the wi&s;h of one among them to di&s;plea&s;e the others.</P>
<P>It particularly chanced one day, that not contented to deny each other every &s;ort of friend&s;hip and obligingne&s;s, they mutually di&s;tre&s;&s;ed each other with reproaches. Mademoi&s;elle Beaufoy, who &s;at as a witne&s;s of this &s;cene&punc; was &s;o affected by it as even to &s;hed tears.</P>
<P>She could not &s;peak a word; and pen&s;ively withdrew into her chamber, that &s;he might the better think upon the means of rendering back to the&s;e unhappy little ones
<PB N="151" REF="157">the plea&s;ures which they had lo&s;t of their former friend&s;hip and reciprocal attachment.</P>
<P>She was &s;till employed in this afflicting ta&s;k when all the four young ladies entered her apartment, with a peevi&s;h and unea&s;y look, complaining that they could be no longer happy in each other's company. There was not one of them but charged the re&s;t with cau&s;ing it; and all toge|ther earne&s;tly de&s;ired their governe&s;s to re&s;tore them, if po&s;&s;ible, to their lo&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The governe&s;s received them in a very &s;erious manner&punc; &s;aying, I ob&s;erve, my children, you ob&s;truct each other in your plea&s;ures; therefore, that this circum&s;tance may never come to pa&s;s again, let each take up her corner in this very room, if &s;he thinks proper, and divert her&s;elf in any way that &s;he likes, but &s;o as not to interfere with either of her &s;i&s;ters. You may have recour&s;e to this new mode of recreation in&s;tantly, as you have leave to play till night; but each (remember) in her corner, as I &s;aid ju&s;t now.</P>
<P>The little girls were charmed with this propo&s;al, took their places, and began to play.</P>
<P>Sophia entered into conver&s;ation with her doll, or rather told her many little &s;tories; but her doll could not reply, and had no &s;tories in her turn to tell. It was in vain to look for any entertainment from her &s;i&s;ters; they were playing, each a&s;under, in their corners.</P>
<P>Juliet took her battledore and &s;huttlecock, yet none applauded her dexterity; be&s;ides, &s;he would gladly have &s;truck it acro&s;s the room, but in that ca&s;e there was no|body to &s;end it back.

<P>And Victoria, who was very &s;kilful as a little hou&s;e|wife, thought how &s;he might give her friends an enter|tainment, and of cour&s;e &s;end out for many things to market. But who was to receive her orders? It was in vain to pitch upon her &s;i&s;ters; they were playing, each a&s;under, in their corners.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158">It was ju&s;t the &s;ame with every other play. All of them &s;uppo&s;ed that it would be compromi&s;ing matters to ap|proach each other, and therefore they di&s;dainfully conti|nued in their &s;olitude. At length the day concluded. They returned again to Mademoi&s;elle Beaufoy, and begged her to &s;hew them a better &s;ort of amu&s;ement than that which &s;he had already recommended.</P>
<P>I can only think of one, my children, an&s;wered &s;he, which you your&s;elves knew very well formerly, but which it &s;eems you have now forgotten. Yet, if you wi&s;h to put it once more into practice, I can ea&s;ily remind you of it.</P>
<P>Oh! we wi&s;h to recollect it with all our hearts, replied they; and &s;tood all attention to &s;eize with ardour the fir&s;t word that their governe&s;s &s;hould utter.</P>
<P>It is, an&s;wered &s;he, that reciprocal obligingne&s;s, that mutual friend&s;hip, which &s;i&s;ters owe to each other. O, my deare&s;t little friends! how mi&s;erable have you con|trived to make your&s;elves and me too, &s;ince you lo&s;t it!</P>
<P>She &s;topped &s;hort when &s;he had uttered the&s;e few words, which yet were interrupted frequently by &s;ighs, while tears of tenderne&s;s ran down her cheeks.</P>
<P>The little girls appeared a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;truck dumb with &s;orrow and confu&s;ion in her pre&s;ence. She held out her arms; they ru&s;hed at once affectionately towards her, and &s;incerely promi&s;ed that they would love each other for the future, and agree as they had done before &s;he left them.</P>
<P>From that moment they betrayed no &s;igns of peevi&s;h|ne&s;s to trouble their harmonious intercour&s;e. In&s;tead of bickerings and di&s;content among&s;t them, nothing now was known but mutual conde&s;cen&s;ions which delighted all who had the opportunity of being with them.</P>
<P>They pre&s;erve this amiable character at pre&s;ent in the world among their friends, of whom they are acknowledged to be the delight and ornament.</P>

When he was nothing but a bailiff, and had &s;carce a coat to wear, I would not lend him money, and it was then that he fir&s;t of all began to hate us. And at length he has compleated his revenge. Our hou&s;e is to be &s;old, and you will not po&s;&s;e&s;s a groat belonging to your father.</P>

<P>If you had but &s;omething to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, I &s;hould not regard my&s;elf. Here is all the money that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.

<P>He will be here this very day.</P>
</SP>

<P>Then I will be &s;ure to tell him &s;omething that may do you good. The king is coming to review our re|giment; &s;o you &s;hall go and tell him your &s;ad &s;ituation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhou&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go tell him! I &s;hould not be able to pro|nounce a word before him. I &s;hould &s;tand &s;tock &s;till, or perhaps run away through fear and terror, were I forced into his pre&s;ence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear: he would return you a kind an|&s;wer. I was once a centinel at Wind&s;or, on the Ter|race, when the king was walking there: it was upon a Sunday evening. I &s;hall never &s;ure forget with what fa|miliarity he &s;poke to people; but that is nothing; for he met one morning with a poor man's child as he was walking through the town, and entering into conver&s;ation, found him &s;uch a clever little fellow, that he ordered him a guinea: when the father heard it, he was ever on the watch to fall in with his maje&s;ty, as he was walking out. He proved at la&s;t &s;o fortunate as to obtain a hearing, when he thanked him for the guinea; upon which the king, would you believe it, ordered him another guinea for his gratitude, as he particularly mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhou&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't tell me &s;o.</P>
</SP>

<P>There cannot be a better. So pray hear what I intend to do; I will get our quarter-ma&s;ter to write me a petition; and though po&s;&s;ibly you &s;hould have twenty miles to walk, no matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moorhou&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what, think you, will the king do for us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell exactly, but we will talk further about it to-morrow. In the mean time, be a&s;&s;ured, dear father, it is much more agreeable to have to do with great than little people. Come, let us take a turn or two to|gether through the village.</P>

Who could keep his temper if he &s;aw his family on the point of being ruined by an ill-natured our of your &s;tamp? We know what &s;tewards are, and how they make fortunes.

<HEAD>THE BED OF DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>DUNCAN, a bricklayer's labourer, living in a di&s;tant country town, had lo&s;t his wife about a quarter of a year before the event we are to write of. The e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pences of a tedious illne&s;s, and the interruption of
<PB N="181" REF="187">his labour by a very rainy &s;ea&s;on, had reduced him to the la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. His children were half naked, and had really no bread to eat. This circum&s;tance was of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently tormenting; but to aggravate the &s;cene, Su|&s;anna, his poor mother, laid upon a little &s;traw in the corner of the cottage, was almo&s;t in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>Duncan, at &s;uch a pro&s;pect round about him, over|whelmed with &s;orrow, took a broken matted chair, and at a little di&s;tance from Su&s;anna's bed &s;at down upon it, having both his hands held up, that he might hide his tears.</P>
<P>His mother turning towards him, with a feeble voice enquired if there was no where in the hou&s;e a rag to put upon her. I cannot make my&s;elf warm, &s;aid &s;he, do what I will.</P>

<P>Do not be frightened thus, my good mother: I am not a &s;ingle farthing in his debt; and for the rent that we owe the '&s;quire at Mid&s;ummer, I will give him all the labour that he requires in harve&s;t.</P>

<P>Duncan went out to know the &s;teward's bu&s;ine&s;s. After he was gone, Su&s;anna fetched a grievous &s;igh, and &s;aid, di&s;cour&s;ing with her&s;elf, Since he was &s;o hard-hearted as to &s;eize upon our goods for rent, I cannot &s;ee or hear him, but my heart revolts at the idea; and at pre&s;ent, in my dying moments, he mu&s;t come and cough at our window. But perhaps the hand of God brings him hither as an admonition for me to di&s;charge my heart of every thing that looks like malice or ill-will again&s;t him, and even pray for mercy on his &s;oul. Well then, my God, I am content to do &s;o. I no longer wi&s;h him any harm. Forgive his &s;in, as I forgive it. <STAGE>(<HI>She hears the &s;teward &s;peaking rather loud.</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<P>Duncan no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words, than he was &s;eized all over with a &s;udden trembling: he took off his hat, fell down upon his knees be&s;ide Su&s;anna's bed, laid hold with ardour of her hand, then lifted up his eyes to heaven, and would fain have &s;poke, but could not: tears and &s;ighs prevented him.</P>
<P>Take comfort, &s;aid Su&s;anna; I am going to a happier life than this, and there will wait your coming. When we once meet there, we &s;hall not part again.</P>
<P>Duncan in &s;ome degree recovering, bowed his head, and craved his mother's ble&s;&s;ing. Ble&s;s me, &s;aid he, my dear mother. I de&s;ire to follow you, when once my chil|dren have no further need of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Su&s;anna opened once again her dying eyes; and with uncommon fervour looking up, pronounced the&s;e words:</P>
<P>Hear me, O heavenly father, and vouch&s;afe the ble&s;|&s;ings of thy grace and favour to my &s;on, the only one that I ever had, and who&s;e affection was the comfort of my life.

<P>Hear me now, my dear Duncan, and carefully ob&s;erve what I &s;hall tell you. Bring your children up in virtue, and accu&s;tom them betimes to a laborious life, that if they &s;hould be poor, they may not, when grown up, lo&s;e courage, and be tempted to do wrong. In&s;truct them to place all their tru&s;t in God, and to live good friends with one another; &s;o that they may find &s;ure con&s;olation in the
<PB N="189" REF="195">evils of this life. Forgive the &s;teward his inju&s;tice. When I am buried, pray inform him that I departed without any malice or ill-will again&s;t him, and be&s;ought of God that he would grant him of his grace to &s;ee the &s;in that he had committed, and repent before he came upon a death-bed. <STAGE>(<HI>She &s;tops a little to take breath, and then goes on.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>Reach me, my good friend, <STAGE>(<HI>to Gertrude</HI>)</STAGE> that book be|hind you; and my dear Duncan, there is a little leather bag in our great che&s;t; I wi&s;h to have it.

<P>They were weeping at a table, whence their father brought them to Su&s;anna, putting them upon their knees be&s;ide her, while &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf a little, &s;o that &s;he might &s;ee them, and began:</P>
<P>My deare&s;t children, I am very &s;orry that I mu&s;t leave you motherle&s;s and poor. Think often of me, my &s;weet babes. I have nothing that I can give you but this book: it has been frequently my con&s;olation, and as often will be yours. When you have learned &s;ufficiently, read in it every evening to your father. It will teach you to be good; and if you are but good, you cannot fail of being happy.</P>
<P>This, Duncan, <STAGE>(<HI>taking out a piece of paper from the leather bag,</HI>)</STAGE> is a certificate which I brought your father of my good behaviour at our marriage. Let it pa&s;s by turns to each of your three daughters, till they marry. It is my la&s;t reque&s;t. And as for you, my &s;on, I have nothing in the world to give you in remembrance of me; but the comfort is, you want none. You will not forget me, I am certain.</P>
<P>Gertrude, &s;hall I reque&s;t one other favour of you, after having pardoned Arthur? When I am dead, &s;ee now and then to the&s;e poor children.&mdash;They have no one friend.&mdash; I recommend you in particular my poor dear Lucy.&mdash;She is the younge&s;t of the three.&mdash;Where is &s;he?&mdash;I can hardly &s;ee.&mdash; <STAGE>(<HI>She &s;tretches out her arm with difficulty.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>Conduct my hand, and let me touch her.&mdash;O my chil|dren! <STAGE>(<HI>&s;he dies.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>After a moment's &s;ilence, Duncan &s;uppo&s;ing her to be fallen a&s;leep, &s;aid &s;oftly to his children, Ri&s;e, and do not di&s;turb her &s;lumber. Might &s;he but recover, after having

What was his di&s;traction then, and that of his helple&s;s family? How they wept and wrung their hands! How they beat upon their brea&s;ts, and tore their hair up by the roots for angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Gertrude, as well as &s;he was able, comforted their &s;or|row, and repeated to Duncan Su&s;anna's parting words, which, in his grief, he had not heard di&s;tinctly.</P>

<HEAD>PASCAL.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dawkins was accu&s;tomed every Saturday to pay his only &s;on, a little boy who&s;e name was Pa&s;cal, an allowance, &s;uch as was &s;ufficient to procure him, the week through, tho&s;e little plea&s;ures and enjoyments which children of his age &s;o naturally pur&s;ue. No le&s;s confident than generous, he never looked for an account from Pa&s;cal of the way in which he laid out what he gave him. He &s;uppo&s;ed his principles to be &s;uch, that he would not abu&s;e his bounty, but remember the in&s;truction which he had &s;o frequently given him upon the &s;ubject. But what lamentable con&s;equences did this too blind credulity pro|duce?</P>
<P>For hardly ever had he touched his weekly payment, but he ran that moment to a &s;hop hard by, and &s;tuffed him&s;elf with pa&s;try and nice things. His pur&s;e, in this fir&s;t on&s;et, underwent &s;o great a diminution, that a very little the next day was &s;ufficient to exhau&s;t it totally: and during the la&s;t part of every week, he never had a far|thing to regale him&s;elf withal; yet he did not, upon that account, the le&s;s hanker after the &s;ame delicacies. Where|fore
<PB N="191" REF="197">being re&s;olved to gratify his palate, he prevailed upon the pa&s;try-cook, at fir&s;t, to give him credit; but when afterwards he found that the boy's allowance was never applied to pay off the&s;e arrears, while on the other hand the debt increa&s;ed, he &s;aw that it was prudent to give in his bill to Mr. Dawkins. Mr. Dawkins was extremely angry with the trade&s;man, reprimanded his improper con|duct, and forbade not only <HI>him,</HI> but every trade&s;man round about, to let his &s;on have any thing for which he could not pay on the &s;pot. This might have been &s;up|po&s;ed a good precaution; and accordingly he thought it could not but become a check on Pa&s;cal's gluttony; whereas it only irritated matters, and the boy, as we &s;hall &s;ee, at any ri&s;que re&s;olved to gratify his palate.</P>
<P>Pa&s;cal's chamber was contiguous to his father's. After having noticed when his father generally &s;lept the &s;ounde&s;t, he once got up &s;oftly, came into his room, and feeling for his breeches, took out half a crown. Emboldened by this fatal &s;ucce&s;s, he frequently repeated his offence, and for a time without detection: but there cannot be a crime, however &s;ecretly committed, which does not come to light at la&s;t.</P>
<P>It chanced that Mr. Dawkins, &s;ome time after Pa&s;cal's fir&s;t offence, in this way, had a law-&s;uit on the following day to be decided. Having thought upon it waking, it is not to be wondered at that it &s;hould take up his attention after he was gone to re&s;t. In fact, he lay quite &s;ilent, ru|minating on the affair, when Pa&s;cal, thinking him a&s;leep, got up as he was wont to do. Unhappily for him, the moon threw light enough into the chamber, that a per&s;on coming in might ea&s;ily be &s;een. Accordingly let any one imagine if he can, what Mr. Dawkins mu&s;t have felt, be|holding his own &s;on thus come and rob him! He for that time &s;tifled his re&s;entment; but before the thief could quit his chamber in the morning, he got up, went to him, and found means to turn the conver&s;ation into &s;uch a channel, as to a&s;k him how much he intended to lay out that day of his allowance. Nothing, an&s;wered Pa&s;cal. I have given all my la&s;t week's money to a poor man in the neighbourhood, and mu&s;t deny my&s;elf a little till next Saturday.</P>
<P>His father could not po&s;&s;ibly re&s;train his indignation any longer, hearing &s;o dete&s;table a lie come from him.
<PB N="192" REF="198">He &s;prung forward, &s;eized him by the collar, for by this time he was dre&s;&s;ed, and found five &s;hillings in his pocket, which was what he had &s;tolen from his father. In pro|portion as he had till now been tender and indulgent to his &s;on, &s;o much the greater was his &s;everity and rigour on this occa&s;ion: for his reprimands were only the pre|amble to a har&s;her treatment, and the wretched Pa&s;cal was obliged to keep his bed for many days, in con&s;equence of the correction that he received.</P>
<P>How difficult it is to extirpate a vice which has once taken root within us! Pa&s;cal was not cured by this cor|rection. Mr. Dawkins left the key of his bureau one evening in the lock, and Pa&s;cal took a model of the wards, and got another made at the &s;mith's. This gave him a convenient opportunity to rob his father whenever he plea&s;ed: who, as he u&s;ually kept a great deal of ca&s;h by him, and as Pa&s;cal was more cunning than to take too much at once, &s;u&s;pected nothing of the affair. He was now fifteen years of age, and could di&s;&s;emble &s;o well, that his parents thought him quite reformed, till his hypocri&s;y was accidentally di&s;covered.</P>
<P>His father had received a piece of foreign coin, among other monies, which he &s;oon remarked, and put it up in the bureau. This piece fell into Pa&s;cal's hands that very night, and Mr. Dawkins mi&s;&s;ing it the next morning, could not but bethink him&s;elf of Pa&s;cal's former inclina|tions, and &s;u&s;pect him. He re&s;olved to &s;atisfy him&s;elf that moment, and examining his pockets, found the piece of money that he had lo&s;t, together with the key, by means of which he had obtained it.</P>
<P>But Pa&s;cal by this time was too big for &s;uch correction as he had received before, and therefore Mr. Dawkins contented him&s;elf with &s;everely upbraiding him for the pre&s;ent, and threatening to withdraw the benefits of his affection from him. He con&s;ulted a few faithful friends that he had, upon the treatment proper to be &s;hewn him: their opinion was in general, that the har&s;he&s;t method of proceeding would mo&s;t tend to his amendment, and ad|vi&s;ed his being &s;ent to &s;chool in York&s;hire, where for years he might not &s;ee his family, but be &s;ubjected to the rigor|ous di&s;cipline and homely fare peculiar to &s;uch in&s;titu|tions, and of cour&s;e have lei&s;ure to repent of his enormity, and be accu&s;tomed to a frugal way of life. This was
<PB N="193" REF="199">their coun&s;el; but the combats of paternal love in Mr. Dawkins's bo&s;om, which was very far, as yet, from being quite extinct, would not permit him to pur&s;ue their &s;alu|tary admonition; he inclined to &s;omething of a gentler nature, and in grief of heart, and as the only moderate method which he could devi&s;e to pre&s;erve him from de|&s;truction, &s;ent that very day to Bri&s;tol for a friend of his, who kept a boarding &s;chool, to who&s;e attention he con|&s;igned, upon the day of his arrival, this unworthy &s;on, with directions to let him have no other money than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his wants. His friend &s;et off on his return immediately, and Pa&s;cal with him.</P>
<P>This was a precaution; but it came, alas! too late: the youth's principles were utterly corrupted. His tutor's table was plain, though very plentiful; for which rea&s;on Pa&s;cal would go out, and at a tavern gratify his palate with the choice&s;t wines and viands, for which he ea&s;ily got credit, as his ho&s;t took care to make enquiry, fir&s;t of all, into his father's circum&s;tances, who, he found, was very rich: nor did he &s;top at this; for to &s;upply that want of money which his tutor would not, he began to play, and practi&s;ed every &s;pecies of deception at a gaming|hou&s;e hard by.</P>
<P>God's providence, as if it interfered particularly to reform him, puni&s;hed all his vices on the &s;pot. Three gamblers, his companions, who detected him endeavour|ing to deceive them with a pack of cards that he had be|forehand &s;orted for the purpo&s;e, fell upon him unawares, and &s;o rough were the effects of their vengeance, that Pa&s;cal was almo&s;t drubbed to death upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>He was carried home with &s;carce the lea&s;t remains of life, and put to bed. His tutor ran to &s;ee him, and af|forded all the &s;uccour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. He waited till he &s;aw him almo&s;t ree&s;tabli&s;hed, to impart &s;uch coun&s;el as might po&s;&s;ibly affect him; which he did with all the &s;oftne&s;s po&s;&s;ible, and pointed out the horrors into which he was plunging him&s;elf. Mi&s;erable youth! &s;aid the tutor, what can have induced you to exce&s;&s;es &s;o di&s;|graceful! You di&s;honour, by your crimes, a name which the probity of tho&s;e before you had exalted, and made really re&s;pectable. You rob your tender parents of tho&s;e hopes which they indulged when fir&s;t they laid the ground|work of your education. When the youth of your ac|quaintance,
<PB N="194" REF="200">who now con&s;ecrate that time to &s;tudy which you con&s;ume in &s;candalous exce&s;&s;es, &s;hall be &s;ought out by their country and employed in elevated &s;tations, you will be con&s;idered as an abject dangerous character. You will be bani&s;hed from all company that have the lea&s;t re|gard or value for their honour, and the meane&s;t cla&s;s of men will &s;corn you.</P>
<P>Pa&s;cal was at fir&s;t affected with this le&s;&s;on. He broke off all commerce with his partners; he was &s;atisfied with his preceptor's table-fare; and &s;eemed as if beginning to imagine that &s;tudy had &s;ome charms to plea&s;e him. But this di&s;po&s;ition was &s;oon done away, and by degrees he relap&s;ed into his former way of life. He &s;old his books; his watch and clothes went afterwards; and he contrived to &s;trip him&s;elf of his apparel &s;o completely, that he could not &s;tir abroad.</P>
<P>On which his creditors came all at once upon him, and receiving a refu&s;al from the tutor to di&s;charge the young man's debts and &s;atiate their avidity, they wrote letters to the father, threatening to arre&s;t him if they were not paid. Let Pa&s;cal's &s;ituation now be imagined. Overwhelmed with the repreaches of his creditors, the indignation of his tutor, the contempt of tho&s;e who waited on him, and his own remor&s;e, he had moreover to dread the maledic|tion of his parents. He was &s;en&s;ible that he had &s;o much neglected to improve his under&s;tanding, that he could not find the lea&s;t re&s;ources again&s;t want in any calling or pro|fe&s;&s;ion. He began to think his &s;ituation de&s;perate. A whole day he pa&s;&s;ed in his apartment violently agitated; every now and then he wrung his hands, tore his hair, and cur&s;ed his vices: but at night, &s;till borne away by his depravity, he went from home to &s;pend the little money that he had left in a tavern.</P>
<P>Accident that evening threw two men into his com|pany who were employed to rai&s;e recruits for India. They remarked upon his countenance the embarra&s;&s;ment with which his &s;oul was agitated, winked to one another, and began to talk of India. They de&s;cribed the beauty of the country, and what pay was given to the &s;oldiery. They &s;poke of the advantages that a youth of family might meet with there, and what a probability there was, that &s;uch a one might make his fortune: nay, they went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert that many, to their knowledge, had from
<PB N="195" REF="201">private &s;oldiers been made officers, and married wealthy widows.</P>
<P>Pa&s;cal heard this conver&s;ation with avidity, joined in the di&s;cour&s;e, and enquired if it was difficult to be en|li&s;ted with the&s;e &s;oldiers. If you wi&s;h to enli&s;t, &s;aid they, we can oblige you, though we have more recruits by many than we want; but you, by your appearance, &s;eem to claim the preference; and thereupon they offered him five guineas if he would enter.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;light &s;truggles, Pa&s;cal took the guineas, and enli&s;ted. The remainder of the night he &s;pent in drinking; and when morning came, was &s;ent to learn his exerci&s;e. He found him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a &s;et of auk|ward ru&s;tics, runaway apprentices, notorious beggars, and convicted thieves, who had enli&s;ted to e&s;cape the gal|lows. He was under the tuition of a &s;urly corporal, who loaded him from time to time with cur&s;es, and &s;everely caned him, when he could not comprehend his meaning.</P>
<P>Pa&s;cal's mi&s;ery went on from day to day encrea&s;ing. All the money that he had lately touched at parting with his freedom, was already gone in riot. He had nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on but the coar&s;e provi&s;ion granted by the com|pany to keep their new recruits together. Lubberkin, who had been a &s;wine-herd, and was then his comrade, was much better off. He had been always u&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ten bread, and therefore thought him&s;elf a prince, when he could get a bit of half-baked meat. But what were Pa&s;cal's feelings, when, partaking of &s;uch coar&s;e pro|vi&s;ions, he reflected on the delicacies of his former repa&s;ts!</P>
<P>Some days after came an order for the &s;oldiers to em|bark. Pa&s;cal heard this news with much more &s;atisfac|tion than the people round about him thought he would have te&s;tified. If once you get to India, &s;aid he to him|&s;elf, as you are young, and of a likely figure, you will make your fortune, as a multitude of Engli&s;hmen have done before you.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all the&s;e brilliant pro&s;pects, Pa&s;cal went on board the ve&s;&s;el de&s;tined to tran&s;port him and his com|rades. He drank down a gla&s;s or two of brandy at the moment of embarking, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;erved to warm hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> head, and to make him utterly forget his parents. He went off with mad huzzas. But then the joy with which he ut|tered the&s;e huzzas continued hardly longer than the
<PB N="196" REF="202">drunkenne&s;s that cau&s;ed them. Tho&s;e on board who were now for the fir&s;t time in their life at &s;ea, began to feel a death-like &s;ickne&s;s. Pa&s;cal, who&s;e intemperance had hurt his in&s;ide much, endured a great deal more than any other. He was &s;everal days in&s;en&s;ible, and nothing &s;taid upon his &s;tomach. Even the &s;ight of food di&s;gu&s;ted him; and when at la&s;t he grew a little better, and was hungry, mouldy pea&s;e, &s;alt beef, and bi&s;cuits full of mag|gots, were the only victuals that he could procure. When he fir&s;t &s;et &s;ail, the &s;oldiers had a pint of beer each allowed them; but by degrees they were deprived of this indul|gence, and compelled to put up with a bare &s;ufficiency of water, and even this they were obliged to &s;train before they could drink it.</P>
<P>After &s;ix long months ince&s;&s;ant &s;uffering, during all which time they were in fear of continual &s;hipwreck, they arrived in India, wearied out with watchings for the mo&s;t part, and a dreadful &s;curvy. Pa&s;cal was marched up the country, with his comrades, to the army: but his heart, embittered by the horror of his &s;ituation, was in&s;en&s;ible of any thing like goodne&s;s. His abandoned cour&s;e of life, the crimes that he was ince&s;&s;antly committing, and his numberle&s;s de&s;ertions, frequently &s;ubjected him to pu|ni&s;hment. He was determined, if he could, to quit the&s;e regions, watched his opportunity, and &s;tealing on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to England, hid him&s;elf below till it had &s;ailed; nor did he quit his hiding place, till the &s;hip was a great way out to &s;ea: he then came &s;orth, and being brought before the captain, promi&s;ed to work his pa&s;&s;age to England; which the captain in the end accepted, as the ve&s;&s;el was in want of men.</P>
<P>What, in the interim, was become of his unhappy pa|rents? They alas! &s;till lived, if people may be &s;aid to live who&s;e &s;ad days are &s;pent in angui&s;h and de&s;pair. The crimes which their &s;on had committed, and with which the neighbourhood all around them rung, had forced them to renounce their place of habitation, and go down and live in Su&s;&s;ex, in a &s;olitary quarter near the &s;ea.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after they were &s;ettled here, the &s;hip, in which Pa&s;cal was, arrived on that very part of the coa&s;t where they had fixed their retirement. For while they were a little way out to &s;ea, Pa&s;cal, a thorough graduate in vice, had con&s;pired with ten or twelve de&s;perate fellows
<PB N="197" REF="203">of the crew, to murder every one on board who would not join in their con&s;piracy, and &s;o obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip. They executed their infernal purpo&s;e; and &s;oon after running the ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore, they hoi&s;ted out their boat at night, that they might come on &s;hore, and pillage the inhabitants.</P>
<P>That very night the unhappy Mr. Dawkins in his hou&s;e was up, and watching by his wife's &s;ick bed. Her grief for Pa&s;cal's wretched fortune had long preyed upon her con&s;titution; and by this time, after having &s;uffered grievou&s;ly, &s;he felt the agonies of death upon her. In the intervals of her delirium, &s;he called out for Pa&s;cal: Where, where are you, &s;aid the dying mother? Come, that I may pre&s;s you to my heart, and pardon you before I die. At this the door is &s;uddenly bur&s;t open, and ten villains ru&s;h into the dwelling. Pa&s;cal, with a hatchet in his hand, was fir&s;t, and led them on. The father comes to meet them with a candle; but before his &s;on could recollect him&mdash;The remainder is too horrid to relate: &s;uffice it, that Pa&s;cal and his gang were apprehended on the &s;pot, and &s;uffered at the gallows.</P>
<P>Children, if when you have read this &s;tory, you dare think of giving way to any vice what&s;oever, tremble at the po&s;&s;ibility of your becoming criminal by degrees, and ending like Pa&s;cal with the crime of parricide!</P>
