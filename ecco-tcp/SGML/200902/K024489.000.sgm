<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>SAMUEL, B. I, C. XX. V. 3.</BIBL> THERE IS BUT A STEP BETWEEN ME AND DEATH.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE, my brethren, are the words of the afflicted David, which he uttered in the deepe&s;t angui&s;h, to his be|loved Jonathan. Saul's anger, which he had unwarily though unde&s;ervedly in|curred, had to the la&s;t degree terrified and alarmed him; he knew the power of his adver&s;ary, and dreaded, not with|out rea&s;on, the warmth of his re&s;entment.
<PB N="10" REF="6">
The danger appear'd &s;o great, and the con&s;equence &s;o unavoidable, that he could not entertain the lea&s;t hope of &s;afety, but gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair: <HI>There is but a &s;tep,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>between me and death.</HI> His &s;ituation indeed, all things con&s;idered, &s;eemed extremely de&s;perate; ruin and de|&s;truction were immediately before him, and there was &s;carce a probability of e&s;|caping it: but what is there which active benevolence and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip will not at tempt, what is there which they cannot perform? Jonathan, who&s;e heart glowed with the tendere&s;t affection for his per&s;ecuted and afflicted friend, &s;oon devi&s;ed the means of unexpected &s;afety, and &s;tepped in between him and death; turned a&s;ide the uplifted dart, and re&s;tor|ed him to peace, honour, and felicity. The manner in which he acted on this occa&s;ion, and the ingenious device which he put in practice to redeem his friend, are de&s;cribed at large in the chapter from whence my text is taken, where the whole intere&s;ting tale is told in that pathetic lan|guage, and with that artle&s;s &s;implicity,
<PB N="11" REF="7">
which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>Leaving therefore the recollection and peru&s;al, with all tho&s;e reflections which will naturally occur to you from the con|&s;ideration of it, to your own lei&s;ure and opportunity, I &s;hall proceed immediately to that obvious application of it, which naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, and to the original of that excel|lent and benevolent in&s;titution which we are here met to commemorate.</P>
<P>The words before us &s;eem to point out and de&s;cribe the general &s;tate of man, and the precarious condition of our frail and tran&s;itory being, &s;o aptly compared in &s;crip|ture to the gra&s;s of the field, which <HI>&s;pring|eth up in the morning, and in the evening is cut down, dried up and withered:</HI> life is in its nature &s;o uncertain, and even at its ut|mo&s;t extent &s;o &s;hort and fleeting, that every one of us might with propriety cry out with David&mdash;<HI>there is but a &s;tep between me and death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="8">
But the exclamation of Jonathan's di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed friend &s;eems peculiarly adapted to the &s;ituation of tho&s;e who&s;e lives are endan|gered on a &s;udden by &s;ome unfore&s;een ac|cident or calamity, which from a &s;tate of perfect &s;afety and happine&s;s reduces them to that of extreme peril, and from which nothing but a change as unhoped for as unexpected can po&s;&s;ibly deliver them: and this, my brethren, is immediately appli|cable to the objects which the Charity I am here endeavouring to recommend is intended to relieve.</P>
<P>Great as the improvements are which in this and other nations have of late years been made in every branch of me|dical knowledge, yet is the inve&s;tigation of our own complicated frame &s;till at|tended with in&s;uperable difficulties: like the re&s;t of the works of God, it mocketh the art of man; we are, as the P&s;almi&s;t long &s;ince ob&s;erved, &s;o <HI>fearfully and won|derfully made,</HI> that we know not with any degree of preci&s;ion where our own ex|i&s;tence either begins or ends, and the re|&s;emblance
<PB N="13" REF="9">
of death is too often mi&s;taken for death it&s;elf: the marks are &s;o equi|vocal as to deceive the nice&s;t judgment, and to mi&s;lead the mo&s;t acute &s;agacity; hence it hath ari&s;en, as the recommenders of this charity have frequently remarked, that before this excellent in&s;titution took place among&s;t us, many, too many, alas! have paid the debt of nature long before it became due unto her, many are lo&s;t in the valley of the &s;hadow of death who might even now have trodden in the chearful paths of life and being.</P>
<P>Simple as the proce&s;s is which we have adopted, plain and obvious as the means are which we have invariably pur&s;ued, it cannot indeed but rai&s;e our a&s;toni&s;hment and wonder that they were not long &s;ince embraced, and univer&s;ally put into prac|tice; but there is perhaps a time appoint|ed by providence for all things that happen in this world, which we can neither anti|cipate nor retard. In the days of bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition an attempt of this nature would have been &s;tiled ra&s;h and pre&s;ump|tuous;
<PB N="14" REF="10">
in the days of ignorance and in|dolence it would have been derided as u&s;ele&s;s and impracticable: even in our own, even in this enlightened aera, it hath been a work of no little toil and labour to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h it. This child of benevolence, fair and well proportioned as it now appears before you, was frowned on at its birth; it had to combat with the fears of the diffident, the oppo&s;ition of the &s;elfi&s;h, the &s;neer of the malevolent, and the reproof of the &s;cornful. But, thanks be to the great in&s;pirer of every good word and work! our little bark hath at length &s;temmed the torrent of prejudice, broke thro' the waves of envy and malice, and is landed &s;afely in the harbour of public approbation. We are &s;urpri&s;ed at what hath been already done, when we con&s;ider how &s;hort a &s;pace hath been employed in the peformance of it; we look back with a&s;toni&s;hment, and forwards with delight and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Not five years, my brethren, have elap&s;ed &s;ince fir&s;t we went forth to &s;ow
<PB N="15" REF="11">
our &s;eed, and &s;ee what noble &s;heaves we have to boa&s;t, and what a plenteous har|ve&s;t. In this &s;hort &s;pace, I am authori&s;ed to inform this a&s;&s;embly, four hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even ca&s;es have been brought before us&mdash;Now, mark, I be&s;eech you, with at|tention what follows&mdash;of the&s;e no le&s;s than two hundred and &s;eventy have been <HI>mi|raculou&s;ly</HI> &s;ucce&s;sful. More than one half of them. Have we not then, my breth|ren, fought nobly with the king of ter|rors? we have dimini&s;hed his conque&s;ts, and abridged his triumphs: we have at lea&s;t divided the &s;poils, and more than poi&s;ed in equal balance the &s;cale of vic|tory.</P>
<P>True Charity, like true beauty, to be admired and embraced needs only to be &s;een and known. It wants no patronage to recommend, no art to emblazon, no eloquence to adorn it. And &s;uch is the happy lot of the in&s;titution now before you, which hath already met with more &s;ucce&s;s than our mo&s;t &s;anguinary hopes could ever have formed an idea of.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="12">
The ble&s;&s;ing which we have been &s;o fortunate as to confer, is of &s;uch a na|ture that it is not confined to the individual who receives it; many a dependant friend, many a thankful relation, many a happy family croud round, and pour forth their grateful acknowledgments for it.</P>
<P>But in ca&s;es of this nature argument mu&s;t ever give way to fact: the tin&s;el of oratory will avail but little, unle&s;s &s;up|ported by the unerring te&s;timony of ex|perience. To this therefore I would wi&s;h to appeal. I would wi&s;h to draw your attention towards &s;ome of tho&s;e intere&s;ting &s;cenes which this in&s;titution hath at various times exhibited and called forth. Permit me to carry you with me but in imagina|tion to one of the mo&s;t tender and affect|ing, and which, if you had heen eye|witne&s;s of, would never have been for|gotten by you. O, for the eloquence of a Demo&s;thenes to de&s;cribe, or the pencil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The little imperfect narrative here given might, I think, furni&s;h matter to &s;ome of our eminent ar|ti&s;ts for an excellent picture; I would therefore recommend it to my friends, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. We&s;t, or that ingenious moral painter Mr. Penny, to try their &s;kill upon it.</NOTE> of a Raphael to delineate it!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="13">
Suppo&s;e your&s;elves then, my brethren, but for a few moments, in your evening walk of rural retirement, on the borders of a delightful &s;tream, imagine your contem|plations interrupted by a &s;trange and un|common appearance. At a little di&s;tance from you behold a bu&s;y bu&s;tling croud of indu&s;trious labourers encircling the body of their haple&s;s companion, whom they have taken, at the hazard of their own lives, out of the neighbouring river, and dragged to the &s;hore without life or motion. Scarce an hour has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the object of their grief and attention had left his little circle of dome&s;tic happine&s;s in all the glow of youth, health, and vigour. And now behold his body &s;wolln, his eyes clo&s;ed and &s;unk, his face pale and livid, his limbs torpid and motionle&s;s: without the lea&s;t &s;igns of life they convey him in hopele&s;s de&s;pondency to his own home. The whole afflicted family, &s;um|moned
<PB N="18" REF="14">
by the dreadful news are gathered together. Fear, de&s;pondency, horror, and a&s;toni&s;hment are &s;pread over every coun|tenance. On one &s;ide behold the aged mother lamenting her lo&s;t child, the prop and &s;upport of her declining years; on the other &s;tands mute and in&s;en&s;ible the af|flicted wife, afraid to look up to the hor|rid &s;pectacle before her; whil&s;t the in|nocent little ones, happy only in not knowing how much they have lo&s;t, look with amazement at the motionle&s;s hands which &s;o lately were &s;tretched out to em|brace them, and wonder at the &s;ilence of him who always &s;o kindly greeted them on his return. Tho&s;e who would mo&s;t gladly take upon them the ta&s;k of re&s;tor|ing him are mo&s;t unable to perform it; their faculties are all ab&s;orbed in grief, their limbs petrified with de&s;pair, and all the precious moments which &s;hould have been employed in the means of his reco|very, are lo&s;t in fruitle&s;s tears and u&s;ele&s;s lamentation. They hang over him in &s;ilent angui&s;h, take their la&s;t farewell in
<PB N="19" REF="15">
the agonies of de&s;pair, and con&s;ign him to the grave.</P>
<P>And now, my brethren, ob&s;erve the change. It chances that one of the &s;ons of humanity, (which is but another name for this in&s;titution) is pa&s;&s;ing by; as &s;oon as he hears of the event, he flies, like the good Samaritan, to the chambers of &s;or|row, he &s;tops the retreating multitude, the idle &s;ons of curio&s;ity who had a&s;&s;em|bled but to gaze at and de&s;ert him, calls on the mo&s;t vigorous and active among&s;t them, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, applies with zeal and alacrity tho&s;e plain and &s;imple means which rea&s;on dictates, as the mo&s;t proper to reanimate, if po&s;&s;ible, the lifele&s;s ma&s;s, and pur&s;ues them with cea&s;ele&s;s toil and unwearied a&s;&s;iduity. Death, yet unwil|ling to quit his hold, or relinqui&s;h his de|voted prey, &s;truggles long and power|fully to detain it: &s;eems to &s;mile, as it were, at the ineffectual labour; till at length &s;ubdued by fortitude and per&s;ever|ance he gives up the conte&s;t. Nature, no longer able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch repeated &s;olicita|tations,
<PB N="20" REF="16">
re&s;umes her &s;u&s;pended powers, and exerts her enlivening influence. A ray of hope breaks in upon the gloom, and lights up every countenance. Behold, at la&s;t, again he moves, he breathes, he lives. What follows is not within the power of language to de&s;cribe; imagination alone can &s;ugge&s;t to you the delightful &s;cene of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, of mutual joy, tran&s;port and felicity.</P>
<P>This, my brethren, is not merely the ideal vi&s;ionary work of creative fancy, but a real and true, however imperfect repre&s;entation of what hath not once but often happened &s;ince the in&s;titution of this benevolent &s;ociety. Had you, who are here a&s;&s;embled, all been pre&s;ent at it, I hope and believe there is not one of you but on his return from it would mo&s;t chearfully contribute towards the &s;upport of &s;uch a charity. Why then &s;hould I not al&s;o hope that even this faint idea and re&s;emblance of &s;uch a &s;cene will &s;trike &s;o forcibly on your minds as to expand them into chearful beneficence?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="17">
But this, my brethren, great as it may &s;eem, is not all which we have to urge in favour of this noble charity, we can boa&s;t of &s;till greater triumphs, and glory in a yet nobler victory, a triumph over de&s;pair, and a victory over &s;in and &s;atan.</P>
<P>If there be a crime that &s;eemeth to pre|clude all hopes of the divine mercy, it is certainly that of &s;elf murther; as it ad|mits not, like all others, either of repara|tion or repentance; it is indeed the highe&s;t and mo&s;t unpardonable offence again&s;t our Almighty Creator, being at the &s;ame time an impious di&s;tru&s;t of his goodne&s;s, and a daring defiance of his power. And yet this horrid practice is become of late years a darling and a fa&s;hionable vice among&s;t us; this <HI>pe&s;tilence</HI> that u&s;ed to <HI>walk in darkne&s;s,</HI> now <HI>&s;talketh in the noon day.</HI></P>
<P>Whether it be owing to that penury and di&s;tre&s;s which are the inevitable con|&s;equence of univer&s;al di&s;&s;ipation and ex|travagance, to the want of true, or the prevalence of fal&s;e religion among&s;t us,
<PB N="22" REF="18">
to the daring confidence of infidelity, or the equally fatal de&s;ponding gloom of methodi&s;m,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed by a gentleman of fortune and undoubted veracity in the country of L&mdash;r, that &s;ince the building of two chapels by a pious Lady of Quality, for the reception of the Methodi&s;ts, there have been repeated in&s;tances of &s;elf-murther, a crime which was &s;carce ever heard of or practi&s;ed in that part of the kingdom, till after the intro|duction and encouragement of tho&s;e pernicious people.</NOTE> we cannot po&s;&s;ibly deter|mine, but certain it is, that not a year, not a month, &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;eth but we have &s;ome melancholy in&s;tances and ex|amples of it: how happy then, my breth|ren, mu&s;t we e&s;teem our&s;elves, in being able to trace the &s;teps of our ble&s;&s;ed re|deemer, and to have contributed towards the &s;aving even a few of our fellow-crea|tures from everla&s;ting mi&s;ery! Without our kind and &s;ea&s;onable a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they would have ru&s;h'd with all their &s;ins into the pre&s;ence of their judge, and <HI>the waters would have gone even over their &s;ouls.</HI> It may be &s;aid, indeed, (and &s;omething is
<PB N="23" REF="19">
always &s;aid by the malevolent and injudi|cious to le&s;&s;en the merit of good works) that tho&s;e who are determined to ru&s;h on death, if they are deprived of one method, will only have re&s;ource to another; and that we &s;hall not therefore by this in&s;titu|tion, much le&s;&s;en the number of &s;elf-de|&s;troyers. But &s;urely, my brethren, if we can turn a&s;ide but one of the arrows of death, if we can &s;hut up one door to eter|nal mi&s;ery and perdition, the trial is wor|thy of all our pains and all our a&s;&s;iduity. Happy, thrice happy are we to add on this occa&s;ion, that not one of tho&s;e who have been prevented by us from executing their horrid purpo&s;e, have from the hour of their deliverance, ever &s;ought for the opportunity of repeating it.</P>
<P>But that the facts here alleged may want no proof to e&s;tabli&s;h or confirm, behold the &s;eal of truth here affixed unto them. Behold a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A number of the happy objects who had been re&s;tored to life, men, women, and children, at|tended divine &s;ervice, and were placed in the gal|lery immediately oppo&s;ite to the preacher.</NOTE> &s;ight that will plead
<PB N="24" REF="20">
more powerfully than all which human eloquence could ever produce. Behold the&s;e living te&s;timonies of human bene|volence, the&s;e &s;peaking monuments of the divine Mercy. Is it in the power of any &s;en&s;ual enjoyment to impart a plea&s;ure equal to that which this glorious &s;pectacle mu&s;t be&s;tow upon you?</P>
<P>What will prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ay to witne&s;&s;es like the&s;e? Send us one from the grave, &s;aid Dives to the Patri|arch, and we will believe. Behold, ye incredulous, not one but many: what Abraham then refu&s;ed is now granted unto you. Behold them, my brethren, a&s;&s;embled in the hou&s;e of God, to return their unfeigned thanks for his unmerited goodne&s;s towards them. Shall I not &s;eize the opportunity to &s;peak to and exhort them?</P>
<P>To you, then, ye favourites of Provi|dence, ye cho&s;en objects of its gracious
<PB N="25" REF="21">
attention, permit me to addre&s;s my&s;elf; permit me to hope that you meet us here with hearts full of gratitude; that ye will not, that ye never can be unmindful of your benefactors; that ye will endeavour to return the obligations conferred on you, by a diligent and punctual di&s;charge of every duty becoming Men and Chri&s;tians. You are peculiarly indebted to Benevo|lence; you owe her a richer &s;acrifice than the re&s;t of mankind, and there is nothing &s;o dear and precious, which you &s;hould not offer up unto her: &s;hew therefore, your regard to tho&s;e who have pre&s;erved you by acts of kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip; not to them, they neither want nor de&s;ire it, but to your fellow-creatures in di&s;tre&s;s; to all tho&s;e who may fall into the like or any other calamity; be ever ready to fly with zeal and alacrity to re&s;cue them from every danger, and relieve them under every affliction.</P>
<P>But above all, my friends, remember that gracious Providence which &s;miled on our endeavours, and ble&s;&s;ed them with
<PB N="26" REF="22">
&s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be all honour and glory.</HI> We are but weak and powerle&s;s in&s;truments in the hands and under the guidance of the Almighty Creator, the great fountain of life and being, even the God of your &s;alvation. <HI>Except the Lord build the hou&s;e, their labour is but vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</HI> To him, therefore, pour forth all your gratitude; to him give the tribute of prai&s;e and adoration. You, my breth|ren, have been graciou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by him who gave you a &s;econd life, and rai&s;ed you to a double being; there is no way for you to repay the ble&s;&s;ing, but by en|deavouring, if po&s;&s;ible, to de&s;erve it. It becometh all men, but above all men it becometh tho&s;e who have been thus mira|culou&s;ly pre&s;erved to take heed unto their ways, to be cautious and circum&s;pect in every word and in every action. If ye are not the mo&s;t diligent and faithful, ye mu&s;t be the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>unprofitable of &s;ervants;</HI> if ye are not the mo&s;t &s;ober,

cha&s;te, the mo&s;t thankful, pious and reli|gious, ye are doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t ungrate|ful and mo&s;t abandoned of men. This, my brethren, we mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and ear|ne&s;tly entreat, this we have an indi&s;putable right to demand of you. Very ungrateful indeed would it be to your benefactors, to &s;pend that life which they have been &s;o fortunate as to re&s;tore in the pur&s;uit of vice and folly, in &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipation, riot, and debauchery. On you it depends, whether we are to con&s;ider the continu|ance of your being as a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e unto you, whether we are to rejoice in our &s;ucce&s;s, or with tears of &s;hame and &s;orrow to repent of it. If your days are but prolonged into guilt, and extended into &s;in and corruption, if you are given back to life only to offend the great Author of it, it were better that the waves had long &s;ince overwhelmed you; <HI>it were better,</HI> as our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>that a mill-&s;tone were hanged about your necks, and that ye were ca&s;t into the &s;ea.</HI></P>

<P>And now, my brethren, to you I re|vert, to you we apply for the further &s;up|port and encouragement of this noble work. The fabric is rai&s;ed, but on you we mu&s;t rely for the &s;upport, and pre&s;er|vation of it. We have already received, with the utmo&s;t gratitude we acknowledge, much kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the generous and humane. But, favoured as we have been by the protection of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter, we wi&s;h &s;till more clo&s;ely to imitate his conduct, and to follow his di|vine Example, <HI>to go about doing good.</HI> There are &s;everal parts of this wide com|mercial kingdom, from their &s;ituation pe|culiarly liable to accidents of this kind, which are at a great di&s;tance from the metropolis, and where con&s;equently the ignorance and indolence joined to the po|verty and di&s;tre&s;s of the inhabitants, &s;tand

Men may talk largely of the virtue, the di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s, and the dignity of human nature, but it will ever be &s;ound, weak, impotent, and vain. God never de&s;igned that this tran&s;itory life &s;hould be a &s;tate of perfec|tion. After all that can be &s;aid, and all that can be done, we mu&s;t take mankind therefore as they are, and not as we would wi&s;h them to be. Happy if we can &s;o

guide their affections, &s;o direct their pa&s;|&s;ions and infirmities as to render them productive of the general good, to make the wants and weakne&s;&s;es of &s;ome continue to the welfare and the happine&s;s of others. Add to this, that many of tho&s;e, who&s;e immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance we frequently &s;tand in need of, are often in &s;uch circum&s;tances and &s;ituations of life as render them un|able to be&s;tow their time and attention without a proper and adequate recom|pen&s;e for it, even though they may in their nature and di&s;po&s;ition be ever &s;o wil|ling, tender, and compa&s;&s;ionate. From &s;uch it would be ungrateful as well as impolitic to withhold it. It mu&s;t on the other hand be acknowledged, and it is a melancholy truth which we are obliged to &s;ub&s;cribe to, that on the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing oc|ca&s;ions, &s;ome are often called in to the relief of the unhappy object, who from education, from habit, from example, from we know not what invi&s;ible cau&s;e, are as unfeeling and in&s;en&s;ible as the element that &s;tifled, and the waves that overwhelm|ed him. Souls thus narrow and contract|ed,

there is but one way to expand, hearts thus hard and callous, there is but one method to &s;often and &s;ubdue; and that we have prudently and &s;ucce&s;sfully put in practice, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time we lament the nece&s;&s;ity of it. But the gra|cious providence of God hath &s;o ordained that out of every evil &s;ome good ari&s;eth; one happy effect of that torpor and in&s;en|&s;ibility which prevaileth among&s;t the poor, the vulgar, and the illiterate, is the oppor|tunity which it be&s;tows on the rich and affluent to be liberal and beneficent. It &s;ecures to you, my brethren, the glorious privilege of contributing, every one of you, as far as your rank and abilities will permit, to one of the mo&s;t humane and benevolent in&s;titutions that was ever &s;up|ported and encouraged in this kingdom. I doubt not, my friends, but you will chearfully adopt, embrace, and rejoice in it.</P>
<P>Let us then, my brethren, if we would <HI>&s;ee many days,</HI> be careful to employ tho&s;e which God hath given us in acts of mercy,
