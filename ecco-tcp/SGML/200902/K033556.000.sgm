<HEAD>HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I HOPE the reader has not forgotten where the third part of this hi&s;tory left off la&s;t month. It fini&s;hed with an account how Jack Brown, by keep|ing idle company, when he &s;hould have been pay|ing his debts, was robbed of his pocket-book while he was a&s;leep on the &s;ettle at the Blue Po&s;ts. It was al&s;o told how, the Landlord not believing one word of his &s;tory, &s;ent him to pri&s;on for debts long due to him.</P>
<P>Brown was no &s;ooner lodged in his doleful ha|bitation, and a little recovered from his fir&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e, than he &s;at down and wrote his friend Stock the whole hi&s;tory of the tran&s;action. Mr. Stock, who had long known the exceeding lightne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation of his mind, did not &s;o utterly di&s;believe the &s;tory as all the other creditors did. To &s;peak the truth, Stock was the only one among them who had good &s;en&s;e enough to know, that a man may be compleatly ruined, both in what relates to his property and his &s;oul, without committing Old
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Bailey Crimes. He well knew that idlene&s;s, vanity, and the love of <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> as it is fal&s;ely called, will bring a man to a mor&s;el of bread, as &s;urely as tho&s;e things which are reckoned much greater &s;ins; and that they undermine his principles as cer|tainly, though not perhaps quite &s;o fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Stock was too angry with what had happened to an&s;wer Brown's letter, or to &s;eem to take the lea&s;t notice of him. However, he kindly and &s;e|cretly undertook a journey to the hard-hearted old Farmer, Brown's father, to intercede with him, and to &s;ee if he would do any thing for his &s;on. Stock did not pretend to excu&s;e Jack, or even to le&s;&s;en his offences; for it was a rule of his never to di&s;|gui&s;e truth or to palliate wickedne&s;s. Sin was &s;till &s;in in his eyes, though it were committed by his be&s;t friend; but though he would not &s;often the &s;in he felt tenderly for the &s;inner. He pleaded with the old Farmer on the ground, that his &s;on's idlene&s;s and other vices would gather fre&s;h &s;trength in a jail. He told him that the loo&s;e and worth|le&s;s company which he would there keep would harden him in vice, and if he was now wicked he might there become irreclaimable.</P>
<P>But all his pleas were urged in vain. The Far|mer was not to be moved. Indeed he argued with &s;ome rea&s;on, that he ought not to make his indu&s;|trious children beggars to &s;ave one rogue from the gallows. Mr. Stock allowed the force of this rea&s;on, though he &s;aw the father was le&s;s influ|enced by this principle of ju&s;tice than by re&s;ent|ment on account of the old &s;tory of Smiler. People,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
indeed, &s;hould take care that what appears in their, conduct to proceed from ju&s;tice does not really proceed from revenge. Better men than Farmer Brown often deceive them&s;elves, and fancy they act on better principles than they really do, for want of looking a little more clo&s;ely into their own hearts, and putting down every action to it's true motive. When we are praying again&s;t deceit we &s;hould not forget to take &s;elf-deceit into the account.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock at length wrote to poor Jack; not to offer him any help, that was quite out of the que&s;tion, but "to exhort him to repent of his evil ways; to lay before him the &s;ins of his pa&s;t life, and to advi&s;e him to convert the pre&s;ent puni&s;h|ment into a benefit, by humbling him&s;elf before GOD." He offered his intere&s;t to get his place of confinement exchanged for one of tho&s;e improved pri&s;ons, where &s;olitude and labour have been made the happy in&s;truments of bringing many to a better way of thinking, and ended by &s;aying, "that if ever he gave any &s;olid &s;igns of real amend|ment he would &s;till be his friend in &s;pite of all that was pa&s;t."</P>
<P>If Mr. Stock had &s;ent him a good &s;um of money to procure his liberty, or even a trifle to make merry with his wretched companions, Jack would have thought him a friend indeed. But to &s;end him nothing but dry advice, and a few words of empty comfort, was, he thought, but a cheap &s;habby way of &s;hewing his kindne&s;s. Unluckily the letter came ju&s;t as he was going to &s;it down to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
one of tho&s;e direful merry-makings which are often carried on with brutal riot within the doleful walls of a jail on the entrance of a new pri&s;oner, who is often expected to give a fea&s;t to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When his companions were heated with gin, "Now," &s;aid Jack, "I'll treat you with a &s;ermon, and a very pretty preachment it is." So &s;aying, he took out Mr. Stock's kind and pious letter, and was de|lighted at the bur&s;ts of laughter it produced. "What a canting dog," &s;aid one! "Repentance, indeed!" cried Tom Crew, "No, no, Jack, tell his hypocritical rogue that if we have lo&s;t our liberty, it is only for having been jolly, hearty follows, and we have more &s;pirit than to repent of that I hope: all the harm we have done is living a little too fa&s;t, like hone&s;t bucks as we are." "Aye, aye," &s;aid Jolly George, "had we been &s;uch &s;neaking mi&s;erly fellows as Stock, we need not have come hither. But if the ill-nature of the laws has clapped up &s;uch fine hearty blades, we are no <HI>felons,</HI> however. We are afraid of no Jack Ketch; and I &s;ee no cau&s;e to repent of any &s;in that's not hanging matter. For tho&s;e who are thru&s;t into the condemned hole indeed, and have but a few hours to live, they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee the Par&s;on, and hear a &s;ermon, and &s;uch &s;tuff. But I do not know what &s;uch &s;tout young fellows as we are have to do with repentance. And &s;o, Jack, let us have that rare new catch which you learnt of the &s;trollers that merry night when you lo&s;t your pocket-book."</P>
<P>Brown &s;oon gave a fre&s;h proof of the power of
<PB N="7" REF="6">
evil company, and of the quick progre&s;s of the heart of a &s;inner from bad to wor&s;e. Brown, who always wanted principle, &s;oon grew to want feeling al&s;o. He joined in the laugh which was rai&s;ed again&s;t Stock, and told many <HI>good &s;tories,</HI> as they were called, in deri&s;ion of the piety, &s;obriety, and &s;elf-denial of his old friend. He lo&s;t every day &s;omewhat of tho&s;e &s;mall remains of &s;hame and de|cency which he had brought with him to the pri&s;on. He even grew reconciled to this wretched way of life, and the want of money &s;eemed to him the heavie&s;t evil in the life of a jail.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock finding, from the gaoler, that his letter was treated with ridicule, would not write to him any more. He did not come to &s;ee him nor &s;end him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, thinking it right to let him &s;uffer that want which his vices had brought upon him. But, as he &s;till hoped that the time might come when he might be brought to a &s;en&s;e of his own evil cour&s;es, he continued to have an eye upon him by means of the gaoler, who was an hone&s;t, kind|hearted man.</P>
<P>Brown &s;pent one part of his time in thoughtle&s;s riot, and the other in gloom and &s;adne&s;s. Com|pany kept up his &s;pirits; with his new friends he contrived to drown thought; but when he was alone he began to find that a <HI>merry fellow,</HI> when deprived of his companions and his liquor, is often a mo&s;t forlorn wretch. Then it is, that even a merry fellow &s;ays of laughter," What is it? and of mirth it is madne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
As he contrived, however, to be as little alone as po&s;&s;ible, his gaiety was commonly uppermo&s;t, till that loath&s;ome di&s;temper, called the Jail Fever, broke out in the pri&s;on. Tom Crew the ringleader in all their evil practices, was fir&s;t &s;eized with it. Jack &s;taid a little while with his comrade to a&s;&s;i&s;t and divert him, but of a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could give little, and the very thought of diver&s;ion was now turned into horror. He &s;oon caught the di&s;temper, and that in &s;o dreadful a degree, that his life was in great danger. Of tho&s;e who remained in health not a &s;oul came near him, though he had &s;hared his la&s;t farthing with them. He had ju&s;t &s;en&s;e enough left to feel this cruelty. Poor fellow! he did not know before that the friend&s;hip of the worldly, is at an end when there is no more drink or diver&s;ion to be had. He lay in the mo&s;t deplorable condi|tion; his body tormented with a dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, and his &s;oul terrified and amazed at the approach of death: that death, which he thought at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and of which his comrades had a&s;&s;ured him that a young fellow of five and twenty was in no danger. Poor Jack! I cannot help feeling for him. Without a &s;hilling! without a friend! with|out one comfort re&s;pecting this world, and, what is far more terrible, without one hope re&s;pecting the next.</P>
<P>Let not the young reader fancy that Brown's mi&s;ery aro&s;e entirely from his altered circum&s;tances. It was not merely becau&s;e he was in want, and &s;ick, and in a pri&s;on, which made his condition &s;o de&s;pe|rate. Many an hone&s;t man unju&s;tly accu&s;ed, many per&s;ecuted Saint, many a holy Martyr has enjoyed
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;ometimes more peace and content in a pri&s;on than wicked men have ever ta&s;ted in the height of their pro&s;perity. But to any &s;uch comforts poor Jack had no right.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian friend generally comes forward at the very time when worldly friends for&s;ake the wretched. The other pri&s;oners would not come near Brown, though he had often entertained and never offended them, even his own father was not moved with his &s;ad condition. When Mr. Stock informed him of it, he an&s;wered, "'tis no more than he de|&s;erves. As he brews &s;o he mu&s;t bake. He has made his own bed, and let him lie in it." The hard old man had ever at his tongue's end &s;ome proverb which he contrived to turn in &s;uch a way as to ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now &s;ee how Mr. Stock behaved. He had his favorite &s;ayings too, but they were chiefly on the &s;ide of kindne&s;s, mercy, or &s;ome other virtue. "I mu&s;t not," &s;aid he, "pretend to call my&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, if I do not requite evil with good." When he received the gaoler's letter with the account of Brown's &s;ad condition, Will Simp|&s;on and Tommy Williams began to compliment him on his own wi&s;dom and prudence, by which he had e&s;caped Brown's misfortunes. He only gravely &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD that I am not in the &s;ame mi&s;ery. It is <HI>He</HI> who has made us to differ. But for <HI>his</HI> grace I might have been in no better con|dition. Now Brown is brought low by the hand of GOD, it is my time to go to him." "What you," &s;aid Will, "whom he cheated of your money?"
<PB N="10" REF="9">
"This is not a time to remember injuries," &s;aid Mr. Stock. "How can I a&s;k forgivene&s;s for my own &s;ins, if I withhold forgivene&s;s from him?" So &s;ay|ing, he ordered his hor&s;e, and &s;et off to &s;ee poor Brown, thus proving that his was a religion not of words but of deeds.</P>
<P>Stock's heart nearly failed him as he pa&s;&s;ed through the pri&s;on. The groans of the &s;ick and dying, and what to &s;uch a heart as his was &s;till more moving, the brutal merriment of the healthy in &s;uch a place, pierced his very &s;oul. Many a &s;ilent prayer did he put up as he pa&s;&s;ed along, that GOD would yet be plea&s;ed to touch their hearts, and that "now (during this infectious &s;ickne&s;s) might be the accepted time." The gaoler ob&s;erved him drop a tear, and a&s;ked the cau&s;e." I cannot forget," &s;aid he, "that the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute of the&s;e is &s;till my fellow-creature. The &s;ame GOD made them; the &s;ame SAVIOUR died for them; how then can I hate the wor&s;t of them? With my advan|tages they might have been much better than I am; without the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD on my good Mini&s;ter's in&s;tructions, I might have been wor&s;e than the wor&s;t of the&s;e. I have no cau&s;e for pride, much for thankfulne&s;s; <HI>let us not be high-minded, but fear."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">

<P>It would have moved a heart of &s;tone to have &s;een poor mi&s;erable Jack Brown lying on his wretched bed, his face &s;o changed by pain, po|verty, dirt and &s;orrow, that he could hardly be known for that "merry &s;oul of a jack boot," as he u&s;ed to be proud to hear him&s;elf called. His groans were &s;o piteous that it made Mr. Stock's heart ach. He kindly took him by the hand, though he knew the di&s;temper was catching. "How do&s;t do Jack?" &s;aid he, "do&s;t know me?" Brown &s;hook his head and &s;aid faintly, "know you? aye, that I do. I am &s;ure I have but one friend in the world who would come to &s;ee me in this woeful condition. O James! what have I brought my&s;elf to? What will become of my poor &s;oul? I dare not look back, for that is all &s;in, nor forward, for that is all mi&s;ery and woe."</P>
<P>Mr. Stock &s;poke kindly to him, but did not at|tempt
<PB N="12" REF="11">
to cheer him with fal&s;e comfort, as is too often done. "I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee you in this dirty place," &s;ays Brown. "As to the place Jack, replied the other, if it has helped to bring you to a &s;en&s;e of your pa&s;t offences, it will be no bad place for you. I am heartily &s;orry for your di&s;tre&s;s and your &s;ickne&s;s; but if it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD by them to open your eyes, and to &s;hew you that &s;in is a greater evil than the pri&s;on to which it has brought you, all may yet be well. I had rather &s;ee you in this humble penitent &s;tate, lying on this dirty bed, in this di&s;mal pri&s;on, than roaring and rioting at the Greyhound, the king of the company, with hand|&s;ome cloaths on your back, and plenty of money in your pocket."</P>
<P>Brown wept bitterly and &s;queezed his hand, but was too weak to &s;ay much. Mr. Stock then de&s;ired the jailor to let him have &s;uch things as were need|ful and he would pay for them. He would not leave the poor fellow till he had given him with his own hands &s;ome broth which the gaoler had got ready for him, and &s;ome medicines which the Doctor had &s;ent. All this kindne&s;s out Brown to the heart. He was ju&s;t able to &s;ob out "my un|natural father leaves me to peri&s;h, and my injured friend is more than a father to me." Stock told him that one proof he mu&s;t give of his repentance was, that he mu&s;t forgive his father, who&s;e provo|cation had been very great. He then &s;aid he would leave him for the pre&s;ent to take &s;ome re&s;t, and de&s;ired him to lift up his heart to GOD for mercy. "Dear James," replied Brown, "do you pray for me? GOD perhaps may hear you, but he will never hear the prayer of &s;uch a &s;inner as I have been," "Take care how you think &s;o," &s;aid
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Stock. "To believe that GOD cannot forgive you would be a &s;till greater &s;in than any you have yet committed again&s;t him." He then explained to him in a few words, as well as he was able, the na|ture of repentance, and forgivene&s;s through a Sa|viour, and warned him earne&s;tly again&s;t unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Poor Jack grew much refre&s;hed in body with the comfortable things he had taken; and a little cheered with Stock's kindne&s;s in coming &s;o far to &s;ee, and to forgive &s;uch a forlorn outca&s;t, &s;ick of an infectious di&s;temper, and locked within the walls of a pri&s;on. "Surely" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "there mu&s;t be &s;ome mighty power in a religion which can lead men to do &s;uch things! things &s;o much again&s;t the grain as to forgive &s;uch an in|jury, and to ri&s;k catching &s;uch a di&s;temper," but he was &s;o weak he could not expre&s;s this in words. He tried to pray, but he could not, at length, over|powered with wearine&s;s, he fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>When Mr. Stock came back, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find him &s;o much better in body; but his ago|nies of mind were dreadful, and he had now got &s;trength to expre&s;s part of the horrors which he felt. "James," &s;aid he, (looking wildly) "it is all over with me. I am a lo&s;t creature. Even your prayers cannot &s;ave me." "Dear Jack," replied Mr. Stock, "I am no mini&s;ter; it does not become me to talk much to thee: but I know I may venture to &s;ay whatever is in the Bible. As ignorant as I am I &s;hall be &s;afe enough while I &s;tick to that." "Aye," &s;aid the &s;ick man, "you u&s;ed to be ready enough to read to me, and I
<PB N="14" REF="13">
would not li&s;ten, or if I did it was only to make fun of what I heard, and now you will not &s;o much as read a bit of a chapter to me."</P>
<P>This was the very point to which Stock longed to bring him. So he took a little Bible out of his pocket, which he always took with him on a jour|ney, and read &s;lowly ver&s;e by ver&s;e, the 55th chapter of I&s;aiah. When he came to the &s;ixth and &s;eventh ver&s;es, poor Jack cried &s;o much that Brown was forced to &s;top. The words were, "Let the wicked man for&s;ake his way, and the unrighte|ous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord." Here Brown &s;topped him, &s;aying "Oh it is too late, too late for me." "Let me fini&s;h the ver&s;e," &s;aid Stock, "and you will &s;ee your error; you will &s;ee that it is never too late." So he read on&mdash;"let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him, and to our GOD, and he will abundantly pardon." Here Brown &s;tarted up, &s;natched the book out of his hand and cried out, "Is that really there? No, no; that's of your own putting in, in order to comfort me; let me look at the words my&s;elf." "No, indeed," &s;aid Stock, "I would not for the world give you un|founded comfort, or put off any notion of my own for a &s;cripture doctrine." "But is it po&s;&s;ible!" cried the &s;ick man, "that GOD may really pardon me? Do'&s;t think he can? Do'&s;t think he will?" "I am &s;ure of it," &s;aid Stock; "I dare not give thee fal&s;e hopes, or, indeed any hopes of my own. But the&s;e are GOD'S own words, and the only difficulty is to know when we are really brought into &s;uch a &s;tate as that the words may be applied to us."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Mr. Stock was afraid of &s;aying more. He would not venture out of his depth; nor, indeed, was poor Brown able to bear more di&s;cour&s;e ju&s;t now. So he made him a pre&s;ent of the Bible, folding down &s;uch places as he thought might be be&s;t &s;uited to his &s;tate, and took his leave, being obliged to return home that night. He left a little money with the gaoler, to add a few comforts to the allowance of the pri&s;on, and promi&s;ed to return in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>When he got home, he de&s;cribed the &s;ufferings and mi&s;ery of Brown in a very moving manner; but Tommy Williams, in&s;tead of being properly affected at it, only &s;aid, "Indeed, Ma&s;ter, I am not very &s;orry; he is rightly &s;erved:" "How, Tommy," &s;aid Mr. Stock, rather &s;ternly, "not &s;orry to &s;ee a fellow-creature brought to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of mi&s;ery? one too whom you have known &s;o pro&s;perous?" "No, Ma&s;ter, I can't &s;ay I am; for Mr. Brown u&s;ed to make fun of you, and laugh at you for being &s;o godly, and reading your Bible."</P>
<P>"Let me &s;ay a few words to you Tommy," &s;aid Mr. Stock. "In the fir&s;t place you &s;hould never watch for the time of a man's bring brought low by trouble to tell of his faults. Next, you &s;hould never rejoice at his trouble, but pity him, and pray for him. La&s;tly, as to his ridiculing me for my religion, if I cannot &s;tand an idle je&s;t, I am not worthy the name of a Chri&s;tian.&mdash;<HI>He that is a&s;hamed of me and my word,</HI> do'&s;t remember what follows, Tommy?" "Yes, Ma&s;ter, 'twas la&s;t Sunday's text,"
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<HI>&mdash;of him &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed when he &s;hall judge the world.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Stock &s;oon went back to the pri&s;on. But he did not go alone. He took with him Mr. Thomas, the worthy Mini&s;ter who had been the guide and in&s;tructor of his youth, who was &s;o kind as to go at his reque&s;t and vi&s;it this forlorn pri&s;oner. When they got to Brown's door, they found him &s;itting up in his bed with the Bible in his hand. This was a joyful &s;ight to Mr. Stock, who &s;ecretly thanked GOD for it. Brown was reading aloud; they li&s;tened; it was the fifteenth of Saint Luke. The circum&s;tances of this beautiful Parable of the Prodigal Son were &s;o much like his own, that the &s;tory pierced him to the &s;oul; and he &s;topped every minute to compare his own ca&s;e with that of the Prodigal. He was ju&s;t got to the eighteenth ver&s;e, <HI>I will ari&s;e and go to my father,</HI>&mdash;at that moment he &s;pied his two friends; joy darted into his eyes. "O dear Jem," &s;aid he, "it is <HI>not</HI> too late, I will ari&s;e and go to my father, my heavenly father, and you, Sir, will &s;hew me the way, won't you?" &s;aid he to Mr. Thomas, whom he recollected. "I am very glad to &s;ee you in &s;o hopeful a di&s;|po&s;ition," &s;aid the good Mini&s;ter. "O, Sir," &s;aid Brown, "what a place is this to receive you in! O, &s;ee to what I have brought my&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Your condition, as to this world, is indeed very low," replied the good Divine. "But what are mines, dungeons, or gallies, to that eternal hopele&s;s pri&s;on to which your unrepented &s;in mu&s;t &s;oon have con&s;igned you. Even in this gloomy

pri&s;on, on this bed of &s;traw, worn down by pain, poverty, and want, for&s;aken by your worldly friends, an object of &s;corn to tho&s;e with whom you u&s;ed to carou&s;e and riot; yet here, I &s;ay, brought thus low, if you have at la&s;t found out your own vilene&s;s, and your utterly undone &s;tate by &s;in, you may &s;till be more an object of favour in the &s;ight of GOD, than when you thought your&s;elf pro&s;perous and happy; when the world &s;miled upon you, and you pa&s;&s;ed your days and nights in envied gaiety and unchri&s;tian riot. If you will but improve the pre&s;ent awful vi&s;itation; if you do but heartily re|nounce and abhor your pre&s;ent evil cour&s;es; if you even now turn to the Lord your Savior with lively faith, deep repentance, and unfeigned obe|dience, I &s;hall &s;till have more hope of you than of many who are going on quite happy, becau&s;e quite in&s;en&s;ible. The heavy laden &s;inner, who has di&s;cover|ed the iniquity of his own heart, and his utter in|ability to help him&s;elf, may be &s;till re&s;tored to GOD'S favour, and become happy, though in a dungeon. And be a&s;&s;ured, that he who from deep and humble contrition dares not &s;o much as lift up his eyes to heaven, when with a hearty faith he &s;ighs out, <HI>Lord be merciful to me a &s;inner,</HI> &s;hall in no wi&s;e be ca&s;t out. The&s;e are the words of him who cannot lie."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;elf-aba&s;ement, the grief, the joy, the &s;hame, the hope, and the fear which filled the mind of this poor man. A dawn of comfort at length &s;hone on his benighted mind. His humility and fear of falling back into his for|mer
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;ins, if he &s;hould ever recover, Mr. Thomas thought were good &s;ymptoms of a found repent|ance. He improved and cheri&s;hed every good di&s;|po&s;ition he &s;aw ari&s;ing in his heart, and particu|larly warned him again&s;t &s;elf-deceit, &s;elf-confidence, and hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>One day, when Mr. Thomas and Mr. Stock came to &s;ee him, they found him more than commonly affected. His face was more gha&s;tly pale than u&s;ual, and his eyes were red with crying. "Oh, Sir," &s;aid he, "what a &s;ight have I ju&s;t &s;een! Jolly George, as we u&s;ed to call him, the ring|leader of all our mirth, who was at the bottom of all the fun, and tricks, and wickedne&s;s that are car|ried on within the&s;e walls, Jolly George is ju&s;t dead of the jail di&s;temper! He taken, and I left! I <HI>would</HI> be carried into his room to &s;peak to him, to beg him to take warning by me, and that I might take warning by him. But what did I &s;ee! what did I hear! not one &s;ign of repentance; not one dawn of hope. Agony of body, bla&s;phemies on his tongue, de&s;pair in his &s;oul, while I am &s;pared and comforted with hopes of mercy and acceptance. Oh, if all my old friends at the Greyhound could but then have &s;een Jolly George! A hundred Ser|mons about Death, Sir, don't &s;peak &s;o home, and cut &s;o deep, as the &s;ight one dying &s;inner.</P>
<P>Brown grew gradually better in his health, that is, the fever mended, but the di&s;temper &s;ettled in his limbs, &s;o that he &s;eemed likely to be a poor, weakly cripple the re&s;t of his life. But as he &s;pent much of his time in prayer, and in reading &s;uch
<PB N="19" REF="18">
parts of the Bible as Mr. Thomas directed, he im|proved every day in knowledge and piety, and of cour&s;e grew more re&s;igned to pain and infirmity.</P>
<P>Some months after this, his hard hearted father, who had never been prevailed upon to &s;ee him, or offer him the lea&s;t relief, was taken off &s;uddenly by a fit of apoplexy; and, after all his threat|enings, he died without a will. He was one of tho&s;e &s;illy, &s;uper&s;titious men, who fancy they &s;hall die the &s;ooner for having made one; and who love the world and the things that are in the world &s;o dearly, that they dread to &s;et about any bu&s;ine&s;s which may put them in mind that they are not al|ways to live in it. As, by this neglect, his father had not fulfilled his threat of cutting him off with a &s;hilling, Jack, of cour&s;e, went &s;hares with his brothers in what their father left. What fell to him proved to be ju&s;t enough to di&s;charge him from pri&s;on, and to pay all his debts, but he had nothing left. His joy at being thus enabled to make re&s;ti|tution was &s;o great, that he thought little of his own wants. He did not de&s;ire to conceal the mo&s;t tri|fling debt, not to keep a &s;hilling for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock undertook to &s;ettle all his affairs. There did not remain money enough, after every creditor was &s;atisfied, even to pay for his removal to his own town. Mr. Stock kindly &s;ent his own cart for him with a bed in it, made as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible, for he was too weak and lame to be removed any other way, and Mr. Stock gave the driver a particular charge to be tender and careful
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of him, and not to drive hard, nor to leave the cart a moment.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock would fain have taken him into his own hou&s;e, at lea&s;t for a time, &s;o convinced was he of his &s;incere reformation both of heart and life; but Brown would not be prevailed on to be further burden&s;ome to this generous friend. He in&s;i&s;ted on being carried to the pari&s;h work-hou&s;e, which he &s;aid was a far better place than he de&s;erved. In this hou&s;e Mr. Stock furni&s;hed a &s;mall room for him, and &s;ent him every day a mor&s;el of meat from his own dinner. Tommy Williams begged that he might always be allowed to carry it, as &s;ome atonement for his having for a moment &s;o far forgotten his duty, as rather to rejoice than &s;ympathize in Brown's misfortunes. He never thought of this fault without &s;orrow, and often thanked his ma&s;ter for the whole&s;ome le&s;&s;on he then gave him, and he was the better for it all his life.</P>
<P>Mrs. Stock often carried poor Brown a bit of tea or a ba&s;on of good broth her&s;elf. He was quite a cripple, and never able to walk out as long as he lived. Mr. Stock, Will Simp&s;on, and Tommy Williams laid their heads together, and contrived a &s;ort of barrow on which he was often carried to Church by &s;ome of his poor neighbours, of which Tommy was always one; and he requited their kindne&s;s, by reading a good book to them when|ever they would call in, or teaching their children to &s;ing P&s;alms or &s;ay the Catechi&s;m.</P>

<P>It was no &s;mall joy to him thus to be enabled to go to church. Whenever he was carried by the Greyhound, he was much moved, and u&s;ed to put up a prayer full of repentance for the pa&s;t, and prai&s;e for the pre&s;ent.</P>
