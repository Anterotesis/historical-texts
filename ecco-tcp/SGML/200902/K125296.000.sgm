<HEAD>A KING or a CONSUL? A NEW SONG to the Tune of <HI>Derry down.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COME all ye brave Engli&s;hmen, li&s;t' to my &s;tory,</L>
<L>You who love peace and freedom, and honor and glory!</L>
<L>No foreign u&s;urper they hither &s;hall bring,</L>
<L>We'll be rul'd by a <HI>native,</HI> our Father and King.</L>
<L>Derry down, down, down, derry down!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Cor&s;ican De&s;pot in England &s;hall rule,</L>
<L>No Di&s;ciple avow'd of the Mu&s;&s;ulman &s;chool;</L>
<L>A Papi&s;t at Rome, and at Cairo a Turk,</L>
<L>Now this thing, now that thing, as be&s;t helps his work.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall Athei&s;ts rule Britons? O never, no never,</L>
<L>Forbid it Religion for ever and ever;</L>
<L>Their heatheni&s;h Con&s;uls then let them not bring,</L>
<L>Our Country is Chri&s;tian, and Chri&s;tian our King!</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In England when wounds are the &s;ailor's &s;ad lot,</L>
<L>Their wounds and their &s;ufferings are never forgot;</L>
<L>To a Palace far nobler our Vet'rans we bring,</L>
<L>Than is kept for him&s;elf by our merciful King.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let any compare, if my &s;aying he blames,</L>
<L>The &s;plendors of Greenwich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A magnificent Ho&s;pital for Sailors.</NOTE> with tho&s;e of St. James.</L>
<L>&mdash;Once <HI>Buoni</HI> trepann'd his poor troops to the Ea&s;t,</L>
<L>O'er de&s;erts too &s;ultry for man or for bea&s;t;</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the battle was over, and hundreds were found,</L>
<L>By the fortune of war ga&s;h'd with many a wound;</L>
<L>Di&s;eas'd and afflicted&mdash;now what do you think</L>
<L>This tender Commander oblig'd them to drink?</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You fancy 'twas grog, or good flip, or good ale;</L>
<L>No, 'twas <HI>poi&s;on,</HI> alas! was the &s;oldiers' regale;</L>
<L>See <HI>Jaffa</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Where French Soldiers were <HI>poi&s;oned</HI> in the Ho&s;pital.</NOTE>&mdash;&s;ee <HI>Ha&s;lar</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Royal Port&s;mouth Ho&s;pital where Engli&s;h Sailors are treated like Princes.</NOTE>&mdash;the diff'rence to prove,</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> poi&s;on, <HI>here</HI> kindne&s;s, <HI>there</HI> murder, <HI>here</HI> love.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And le&s;t we &s;hould publi&s;h his horrible tricks,</L>
<L>With our freedom of printing a quarrel he picks;</L>
<L>But <HI>we</HI> keep no &s;ecrets, each new&s;paper &s;hews it,</L>
<L>And while we act fairly we care not who knows it.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Frenchmen, O Britons, we never will tru&s;t;</L>
<L>Who murder their Monarch can never be ju&s;t;</L>
<L>That freedom we boa&s;t of, the French never &s;aw,</L>
<L>'Tis guarded by order and bounded by law.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That <HI>Buoni</HI>'s invincible, Frenchmen may cry,</L>
<L>Let Sidney the brave give each boa&s;ter the lie;</L>
<L>Tho' the arrows of Europe again&s;t us are hurl'd,</L>
<L>Be true to your&s;elves and you'll conquer the world.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' &s;ome &s;truggles we make, let us never repine,</L>
<L>While we &s;it underneath our own fig-tree and vine;</L>
<L>Our Fig-tree is Freedom, our Vine is Content,</L>
<L>Two ble&s;&s;ings, by nature for Frenchmen not meant.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>French liberty Engli&s;hmen never will &s;uit,</L>
<L><HI>They</HI> have planted the tree, but <HI>we</HI> feed on the fruit;</L>
<L>Then rail not at taxes, altho' they cut deep,</L>
<L>'Tis a heavy In&s;urance to &s;ave the brave Ship.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let narrow-&s;oul'd <HI>party</HI> be bani&s;h'd the land,</L>
<L>And let Engli&s;hmen join with one heart and one hand;</L>
<L>Let each fight for his Wife, for <HI>we</HI> marry but <HI>one,</HI></L>
<L>The French wed &s;o many, they oft care for none.</L>
<L>Derry down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One King did not &s;uit them, three Tyrants they cho&s;e,</L>
<L>And their God they renounce while their King they depo&s;e;</L>
<L>Then we ne'er will &s;ubmit to the Cor&s;ican's rod,</L>
<L>Britons want but one Wife, and one King, and one GOD.</L>
<L>Derry down, down, down, derry down!</L>
