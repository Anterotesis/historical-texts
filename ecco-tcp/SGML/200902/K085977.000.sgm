<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;everal voyages that have been made into the South Seas, have been undertaken with the patronage of different &s;tates, in order to find out whe|ther there is a &s;outhern continent, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;uch a one exi&s;ted. In hopes of effecting this, the following &s;teps have been taken:</P>
<P>In 1519, Ferdinand Magalhaens, a Por|tugue&s;e, commanding five Spani&s;h &s;hips, left Seville, di&s;covered the &s;traits that bear his name, and through them &s;ailed into the Southern Ocean. His &s;hip was the only one, out of the five, that returned to Spain by the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">In September 1577, Sir Francis Drake, an Engli&s;hman, &s;ailed from Plymouth, with five &s;hips, and returned thither with one only, in November 1580.</P>
<P>In July 1586, Sir Thomas Cavendi&s;h, an Engli&s;hman, left Plymouth, with three &s;hips, and returned in September 1588. The&s;e la&s;t two voyages were productive of no di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In July 1598, Oliver Van Noort, a Dutchman, &s;ailed from Rotterdam, with four &s;hips, &s;ailed along the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of America, from whence by the Ladrones, the Moluccas, and the Cape of Good Hope, he returned in Augu&s;t 1601, with one &s;hip, without making any di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1614, George Spilberg, a Dutchman, &s;ailed from Zealand, with &s;ix &s;hips, and returned by the Ladrones and Moluccas, with two &s;hips only, in July 1617, without any di&s;covery.</P>
<P>In June 1615, James Le Maire, and William Cornelius Schouten, &s;ailed from the Texel, with two &s;hips, doubled Cape Horn, di&s;covered &s;everal i&s;lands in the South
<PB N="iii" REF="4">Seas, and returned in two years and ten days. Le Maire died in the voyage.</P>
<P>In 1623, James L'Hermite, a Dutchman, with eleven &s;hips, &s;ailed into the Southern Ocean, by Cape Horn, and made no di&s;|coveries; he died on the pa&s;&s;age, and hard|ly any of the &s;hips but his own, returned by Batavia in July 1626.</P>
<P>In 1683, one Cowley, an Engli&s;hman, &s;ailed from Virginia, doubled Cape Horn, and returned to England by the Cape of Good Hope, in October 1686, without making any di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In 1689, William Dampier, an Engli&s;h|man, &s;ailed round the world and returned in 1691.</P>
<P>Edward Cooke, an Engli&s;hman, made the voyage in 1708 and 1711.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1708, Woodes Rogers, an Engli&s;hman, left Bri&s;tol, doubled Cape Horn, attacked the Spani&s;h coa&s;t up to California, and arrived in the Downs, by the Cape of Good Hope, in October 1711.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">Ten years after, Roggewein, a Dutch|man, left the Texel, with three &s;hips, &s;ailed round Cape Horn, di&s;covered &s;everal i&s;lands in the South Seas, and returned July 1723.</P>
<P>In 1741, Admiral An&s;on made a voyage al&s;o round the world.</P>
<P>In June 1764, Commodore Byron &s;ailed from the Downs, and doubling Cape Horn, returned by the Cape of Good Hope, in May 1766, after having made &s;ome di&s;|coveries.</P>
<P>In July 1766, Captain Wallis &s;ailed from England, with two &s;hips, doubled Cape Horn, and returned by the Cape of Good Hope in May 1768, with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>M. De Bouganville, a Frenchman, &s;ailed from Bre&s;t, in 1766, doubled Cape Horn, and returned by the Cape of Good Hope to St. Maloes, in 1769, with &s;ome di&s;co|veries.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1768, Captain Cooke made the &s;ame voyage with further di&s;coveries, and returned by Batavia in July 1771.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6">In June 1772, Captain Cook made the voyage a &s;econd time, with &s;till greater &s;ucce&s;s, and returned in July 1775. And,</P>
<P>In July 1776, Captain Cook &s;ailed from Plymouth a third time, upon the &s;ame errand.</P>
<P>The Southern Ocean has al&s;o been ex|plored by different people, who did not make a regular voyage round the globe; viz. by one Paulmier de Gonneville, a Frenchman, in 1503 and 1504; by Alfonzo de Salazar, a Spaniard, in 1525; by Alvaro de Saave|dra, in 1526; by Hurtado and Hernando, in 1533; by Ga&euml;tan, in 1542; by Men|doca and Mendana, in 1567; by Menda|na, in 1595; by De Quiros, a Spaniard, in 1605; by Ta&s;man, a Dutchman, in 1642; and others, who all made &s;ome di&s;|coveries, but who have all failed in what they wi&s;hed to find,&mdash;a Southern Continent; &s;o that none now is &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t; for Captain Cook, in his la&s;t voyage, &s;ailed into as high &s;outhern latitude as 71&deg;, and met with nothing but i&s;lands of ice, that inter|rupted his pa&s;&s;age, and obliged him to &s;teer
<PB N="vi" REF="7">northward again. But it &s;till remains for future navigators to continue di&s;coveries in the va&s;t Pacific Ocean; for none of the voyagers already mentioned &s;ailed further north than 10&deg; S. latitude; &s;o that almo&s;t acro&s;s the whole ocean, from the continent of America to New Britain, the &s;pace be|tween 10&deg; S. to near 60&deg; N. latitude, remains &s;till to be explored. The Ru&s;&s;ians, indeed, have di&s;covered &s;ome land in this part of the world, in high northern latitude, to the ea&s;t of Chine&s;e Tartary, called Kam&s;chatka, or Camchatca, of which &s;ome account is given at the end of this work; but whether or not there is any land be|tween that and 10&deg; S. of the line, is yet to be determined.</P>
<P>There are many i&s;lands, even in the Southern Seas, that are not noticed in this work, but they are &s;uch as were merely di&s;|covered in pa&s;&s;age, or barely touched at; of cour&s;e no account has been, or could be given of them, but their &s;ituation will be &s;een in the chart.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8">In order to reduce this work into one vo|lume, that it might be within the reach of every one's pocket, the author has &s;tudied to avoid all &s;orts of digre&s;&s;ion; if, therefore, it is barren of reflections and ob&s;ervations, he begs it may be con&s;idered that his plan was conci&s;ene&s;s, and to pre&s;erve this, he has been under &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity of foregoing any great attention to the beauty of the lan|guage. The pages &s;well with narrative, and narrative only. Facts are what the reader will look for, and in the&s;e he will be abun|dantly gratified. As to reflections and ob|&s;ervations, upon what he is made acquainted with, his own rea&s;on will &s;ugge&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH SEAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;outhern hemi&s;phere having never till now been explored, and affording us as it were a new world, it cannot but be highly agreeable to the public to have a de|&s;criptive account of it. It is true we may pick out &s;uch an account from the journals of the &s;everal voyages that have been made into that part of the world, but it lies &s;o diffu&s;ed amid&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="10">a heap of matter u&s;ele&s;s to the general reader, as to be tedious, unin&s;tructive, and unenter|taining: Be&s;ides, the accounts there given being blended with metereological ob&s;ervations on the weather, temperature of climate, and variation of the compa&s;s, &s;oundings, and bear|ings, nece&s;&s;ary only to a navigator, the pages are &s;o exceedingly voluminous as to be &s;welled to many quarto volumes. It has been the bu&s;i|ne&s;s therefore of the compiler of the pre&s;ent narrative to dige&s;t and range the matter, there found, &s;o as to give &s;ome regular account of each i&s;land, from its fir&s;t di&s;covery to the pre|&s;ent time, and to &s;hew the &s;tate of the inha|bitants, &amp;c. as it fell under the ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e who have there touched. And he has endeavoured to de&s;cribe every thing &s;o particu|larly as to render drawings of them unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It being immaterial which i&s;land is fir&s;t treat|ed of, we will begin with that which is mo&s;t known, the i&s;land of O-Taheitee, as it is called by the natives, or King George the Third's I&s;land, as it was afterwards named by Captain Wallis.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="11">
<HEAD>O-TAHEITEE, OR GEORGE THE THIRD's ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS i&s;land was probably fir&s;t di&s;covered by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, a Spaniard; who &s;ailed from Lima in Peru on Dec. 21, 1605, and made this land on the 10th of February fol|lowing: he called it La Sagittaria. He con|tinued here but two days, leaving it the 12th of the &s;ame month. It was next met with by Captain Wallis on the 18th of June, 1767, who called it George the Third's I&s;land, and continued there about a month. On the 2d of April, 1768, M. de Bouganville, who made this voyage by order of the King of France, arrived at the ea&s;tern part of this i&s;land, and left it on the 13th. Captain Cook was the next per&s;on that vi&s;ited it, coming to anchor here April 13, 1769. He went round the whole i&s;land in a boat, and continued here three months. He made a &s;econd trip to this place, and reached it Augu&s;t the 16th, 1773,
<PB N="4" REF="12">and left it September the 1&s;t following; re|turned April 22, 1774; left it again May the 14th following, and is now upon his pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ame place a fourth time. It lies in 17&deg; 30&prime; &s;outh latitude, and 150&deg; we&s;t longitude; and its S. E. bearing, at about two leagues di&s;tance, re&s;embles a high pyramidical rock: It con&s;i&s;ts as it were of two circular penin&s;ulas, one near as large again as the other, joined by a &s;mall neck of land: and one of the&s;e penin|&s;ulas is called by the natives <HI>Opoureonu</HI> or <HI>O-Taheitee nue,</HI> that is, Great O-Taheitee, and is about nineteen miles acro&s;s; the other <HI>Tiar|rabo</HI> or <HI>O-Taheitee ete,</HI> that is, Le&s;&s;er O-Taheitee, and is about eight miles acro&s;s; the neck of land that joins them is about two miles over, and the whole i&s;land in length is about thirty miles, and in circuit about one hundred and twenty.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Face of the Country.</HEAD>
<P>THE i&s;land in general is &s;urrounded by a reef of coral rocks which forms many excellent bays and harbours, with plenty of room, and depth of water &s;ufficient for the large&s;t &s;hips. The face of the land, except the &s;ea coa&s;ts, is far from level; it ri&s;es in hills quite to the middle of the i&s;land, and there forms
<PB N="5" REF="13">mountains vi&s;ible at twenty leagues di&s;tance, &s;o high that the i&s;land of Huaheine to the we&s;t may be &s;een in a clear day though at the di&s;tance of forty leagues; the only low land is between the &s;ea and the bottom of the hills, which is of various breadths in different parts, but no where more than about a mile and a half, &s;o that each of the penin&s;ula's may be compared to a high crowned hat as it lies with its brim flat upon a table. The &s;oil, except at the very &s;ummit of the hills, is rich and productive, being watered with a number of rivulets, and cloathed with variety of fruit-trees of fine thick foliage and lofty growth, with &s;hrubberries every where of odoriferous flowers. The trees &s;tand &s;o thick, that the country &s;eems one continued wood, and in &s;ome places, even the tops of the hills, though in general bare, being burnt up with the &s;un, are not wholly fruitle&s;s. They are rocky, but woody on the &s;ides, and covered with fern on the tops, and the vallies covered with herbage. From the black rocks of Bi|&s;altes, and the appearance every where of burnt clay and &s;tone, there is very good rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e that the i&s;land has undergone a variety of changes by &s;ubterraneous fires;&mdash;but at pre&s;ent it wears the mo&s;t beautiful appearance, and &s;eems to be a univer&s;al garden.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="14">The flat lands bordering on the &s;ea, and &s;ome few of the vallies, are the only parts where the inhabitants dwell. The hou&s;es are built with|out order, &s;cattered up and down about fifty yards from each other, in the &s;hade of fruit-trees, and each hou&s;e has a little planta|tion of plantain-trees from which they make their cloth. The communications from place to place are by public paths judiciou&s;ly formed, and carefully kept. The number of inha|bitants cannot be a&s;certained with any degree of certainty; but from what could be collected from the natives, and the number of their war canoes, the whole i&s;land cannot contain le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and inhabitants; the &s;tronge&s;t proof of its fertility and the richne&s;s of the &s;pot.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Productions.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief productions of this i&s;land, are the bread-fruit. Ba|nanas, or plantains of thirteen different &s;orts, cocoa-nuts, yams, the cura&s;&s;ol, or cu&s;tard|apple, a tree that produces fruit &s;omething like the pine-apple, plenty of &s;ugar-canes, a &s;pe|cies of wild indigo, a very fine red and yellow &s;ub&s;tance for dying, ginger and turmeric, and many more which &s;erve for food and other pur|po&s;es: but they have no European fruit, vege|tables,
<PB N="7" REF="15">or grain of any kind. The bread-tree grows to near forty feet in height, and its leaves are large and palmated of a deep green colour on the upper &s;ide, and paler on the under, and bears male and female flowers, which &s;hoot out &s;ingle at the bottom of each leaf; the male flower drops off and the female produces the fruit, which, when full grown, is as big as a man's head, weighs three or four pounds, and is, on the out&s;ide, much like a rough melon. It bears fruit a great part of the year, &s;ome fit to pluck at different &s;ea&s;ons. It is generally gathered before it is ripe; and the following is the method of preparing it for u&s;e. Having &s;craped off the rind, they cut it into quarters, lay it between leaves, and bake it for two or three hours, it then appears inviting like a well-baked loaf, and ta&s;tes as if made of flower. It will not keep many days, but they have a method of pre&s;erving it for &s;everal months. They build canoes of the wood of this tree, and make a kind of cloth of the bark.</P>
<P>The cocoa-nut, when half ripe, yields rather more then a pint of delicious liquor; the milk and the kernel is good to eat; of the rind they make a variety of things, as by &s;oaking and beating it it will become a kind of thread; and of the leaves they make bonnets and ba&s;kets.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">M. De Bouganville, when he was there in 1768, per&s;uaded one of the chiefs to enclo&s;e a piece of ground for a garden, had it dug, &s;owed it with wheat, barley, oats, rice, maize, onions, and pot-herbs of all kinds, and gave him to under&s;tand of what great u&s;e they would be to the inhabitants if they were properly attended to; they did not thrive, for Cap|tain Cook, in 1773, neither &s;aw nor heard of any of their product. In May, 1769, Captain Cook &s;owed &s;ome melon &s;eed, and the &s;eed of other plants, but they did not come up; this might indeed have been the fate of the &s;eeds which M. de Bouganville &s;owed. Indeed no Eu|ropean &s;eeds &s;eem to &s;ucceed here but tho&s;e of pumkins, which the natives di&s;like. M. De Bou|ganville al&s;o left a cock and hen turkey, and &s;ome ducks and drakes. The turkeys it is &s;up|po&s;ed died, as there were none in 1774, but it is pre&s;umed the ducks bred, and encrea&s;ed, there being plenty of them at pre&s;ent in the i&s;land. Captain Cook in Augu&s;t, 1773, left a couple of goats, male and female, and on his return, the April following, he found that the &s;he goat had two kids, and was then with kid again, that they looked fleck and well, that their hair was as &s;oft and fine as &s;ilk, and that there was
<PB N="9" REF="17">great pro&s;pect of the i&s;land's being &s;tocked with them. They al&s;o put near twenty cats on &s;hore.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Animals.</HEAD>
<P>OF dome&s;tic animals they have only little hogs of the Chine&s;e breed, &s;mall dogs, and fowls like ours: The dogs are very different from tho&s;e we are ac|quainted with, being a heavy, &s;luggi&s;h animal of little more &s;en&s;ibility then &s;heep. Of wild animals, they have only ducks, turtle-doves of a beautiful green, large pigeons of a deep blue colour, cuckoos, king-fi&s;hers, herons, &amp;c. and paroquets beautifully red and green. They have al&s;o &s;ome few turtles. As to quadrupeds they have no other than rats, which abound here; nor have they any frogs, toads, &s;erpents, or other venemous animals, not even a trou|ble&s;ome in&s;ect, the plague of other tropical countries, except a few ants, and of the&s;e but few.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Climate.</HEAD>
<P>THE climate is a healthy one, and as to its heat, Reaumur's thermometer continued between 18&deg; and 22&deg; in April, and Farenheit's about 90&deg; and 95&deg; in Augu&s;t.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="18">
<HEAD>Per&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of the i&s;land are a &s;tout well-made people; tall, &s;trong, &s;tately, and fine &s;haped: the men are fit models to paint a Hercules or a Mars from, and are generally from five feet &s;even to &s;ix feet high, and &s;ome even taller: the women are remarkably hand&s;ome and beauti|fully made; tho&s;e of di&s;tinction rather taller than the Engli&s;h, tho&s;e of an inferior cla&s;s, rather below us in height. This may po&s;&s;ibly proceed from their early commerce with men. Their natural complexion is a clear <HI>brunette;</HI> their features do not differ from tho&s;e of the Europeans, except that their no&s;es are rather flat, being purpo&s;ely flattened in their infancy; their &s;kin is delicately &s;oft and &s;mooth, their eyes are black, &s;parkling, and full of expre&s;|&s;ion, and &s;ometimes melting with &s;oftne&s;s; though they have no crim&s;on in their cheeks they are delicately clear, their teeth are beau|tifully white and regular, which continue &s;o to old age; and their breath without the lea&s;t de|gree of taint; and it is apprehended that were they le&s;s expo&s;ed to the &s;un and air, they would be as white as our&s;elves: Nay, the &s;kins of &s;ome few were &s;een of a dead white,
<PB N="11" REF="19">like the no&s;e of a white hor&s;e. The&s;e had white hair, eye-brows, and eye-la&s;hes, red and weak eyes, &s;kins &s;curfy, and covered with a &s;ort of down, and were &s;hort-&s;ighted; but it was &s;up|po&s;ed they became &s;o by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Their hair in general is black, which they cut &s;hort round their ears, but &s;ome few have brown hair, and others red and flaxen, though in children it is mo&s;tly flaxen; whereas the ori|ginal natives of A&s;ia, Africa, and America have univer&s;ally black hair: they oil it with cocoa|nut oil, in which they infu&s;e a root that gives it the &s;mell of ro&s;es, and though they have no combs, they dre&s;s it neatly. The men wear their beards in many &s;hapes, plucking out great part of them, but all in general have whi&s;kers, which they keep clean and neat, and permit to grow &s;o as to flow about the &s;houlders, or el&s;e they tie it in a bunch upon the crown of their heads. Both men and women take great pains to take out by the roots every hair that grows in the arm-pits, and &s;eem a&s;toni&s;hed that we are not delicate enough to do the &s;ame. For want of combs they are too apt to be lou&s;y, which the children and common people pick out and eat;&mdash; the only in&s;tance in which they are not cleanly; but tho&s;e who could procure combs from any
<PB N="12" REF="20">of Captain Cook's people, &s;hewed their abhor|rence of this filthine&s;s, by combing their heads till they had totally extirpated the&s;e di&s;agreeable attendants: indeed cleanline&s;s is their chief characteri&s;tic. Both men and women regularly bathe them&s;elves in running water thrice a day; as &s;oon as they ri&s;e, at noon, and before they go to re&s;t. They wa&s;h their mouths at every meal, and not only their mouths but their hands, and this five or &s;ix times in the cour&s;e of the meal, and they keep their clothes without either &s;pot or &s;tain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE people in general, both men and women, are frequently &s;een with|out any other covering than a &s;a&s;h or mantle round their wai&s;t; but the principal people have an additional garment, they wrap them|&s;elves gracefully in a piece of cloth containing many yards, which hangs down as low as the knees. Some of the women wear a piece of cloth, with a hole in the middle through which they put their head, &s;o that it hangs down be|fore and behind below the knees; over this they throw a fine white cloth, like a mantle, which is wound &s;everal times over the body, in elegant turns, below the brea&s;t, forming a kind
<PB N="13" REF="21">of tunic, one turn &s;ometimes falling gracefully acro&s;s the &s;houlders; and they know how to hang this mantle over them, &s;o as to give them|&s;elves an air of elegance and coquetry. The inferior &s;ort of people are known by a le&s;s quantity of cloth about them. Girls under four years of age go quite naked, and boys till they are &s;ix or &s;even. The women of di&s;tinc|tion, in the evening, uncover them&s;elves to the wai&s;t; and the men, though they &s;hall have about their middle as much cloth as would cover nine or ten per&s;ons, will frequently leave the re&s;t of the body quite naked; this cloth is made like paper, of macerated bark, &s;pread out and beaten together. On their heads they occa&s;ionally wear a little bonnet, made of mat|ting, or cocoa-nut leaves, to defend their faces from the &s;un; and the women &s;ometimes wear &s;mall turbans, and &s;ometimes plait their hair in threads, and wind it round their heads, &s;o thick as to produce a very good effect. In this they occa&s;ionally &s;tick flowers and feathers, by way of ornament. Both men and women wear ear-rings in one ear, made of &s;hell, berries, or &s;mall pearls. They likewi&s;e let their finger nails grow, except that of the middle finger on
<PB N="14" REF="22">the right hand, and &s;eem to pride them&s;elves in it.</P>
<P>When De Quiros fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, in 1606, the men were quite naked, and the women covered only from the wai&s;t down|wards with a garment made of the palm-tree; he, indeed, &s;aw one man, who &s;eemed to be a chief, who had on his head a kind of coronet made of &s;mall black feathers, &s;o fine and &s;oft that they re&s;embled &s;ilk, and behind hung down a bunch of red hair &s;omewhat curled, as low as the middle of his back: by which we learn that a century and a half will make &s;ome alterations in the cu&s;toms of the natives of the South Seas as well as in Europeans.</P>
<P>It is a univer&s;al cu&s;tom with the&s;e people, both men and women, to mark their loins and breech, and back part of their thighs, with black or blue lines, in a variety of forms, which they call <HI>Tattowing.</HI> They &s;tain them&s;elves in this manner, by puncturing or pricking the &s;kin till it ju&s;t bleeds, with a &s;harp in&s;trument, &s;ome|thing like a comb, and then rubbing upon the part a grea&s;e made of &s;oot and oil, which con|tinues through life; &s;uch as are marked with deep blue punctures have the parts rubbed with
<PB N="15" REF="23">the juice of a plant that gives that colour. They do not mark their children till they are about thirteen years old; and though it is a painful operation, and &s;everal days before the part is healed, they bear it Stoically, and with great re&s;olution; con&s;idering it as the highe&s;t orna|ment. They are very lavi&s;h of this decoration, e&s;pecially on the breech, and take pride in &s;hewing it when they grow up, either as marks of di&s;tinction, or proofs of their fortitude in un|dergoing the operation.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Food.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR diet is chiefly vegetables &s;uch as bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, plan|tains, yams, a particular kind of apple which the country affords, and other fruits; yet they occa&s;ionally eat pork, poultry, dogs-fle&s;h, and fi&s;h. Their dogs are fed wholly on vegetables, and when killed young, and well dre&s;&s;ed, are very little inferior to lamb. The &s;ea furni&s;hes them with a variety of fi&s;h, and their rivers yields them &s;mall mullet. Small fi&s;h are eaten raw, and for want of &s;alt they dip their meat, as they eat it, into &s;ea water. They are very expert at catching fi&s;h, which they do both by nets and lines, their hooks being made of mo|ther of pearl, and they have a method of in|toxicating
<PB N="16" REF="24">fi&s;h, by the juice of one of their plants, &s;o as to catch them with the hands.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be handed down among them, by tradition, that in early ages, there was upon this i&s;land a race of cannibals, or men-eaters, who were a very &s;turdy, &s;trong people; but this race has been a long time extinct. In the le&s;&s;er penin&s;ula there is &s;carce any bread-fruit, and the people &s;eem wholly to live upon nuts, not unlike a che&s;nut.</P>
<P>Their manner of dre&s;&s;ing their food is very &s;ingular; having procured fire by making a groove in one &s;tick, and rubbing another in that groove, in the &s;ame manner as carpenters whet their chi&s;&s;els, till the &s;mall du&s;t kindles, they dig a hole in the ground about &s;ix inches deep, and eight or nine feet in circuit; this done, they pave the bottom with pebbles, and make a fire in it: they then &s;weep off the a&s;hes, and lay their food upon it, fir&s;t covering it with plantain leaves, and then heaping over it the hot embers&mdash;Here it lies till it is &s;ufficiently baked; and when taken out, it is tender, juicy, and full of gravy. Their chief drink is water, but they &s;ometimes drink the juice of the co|coa-nut. They have an intoxicating juice, which they pre&s;s out from the root of a plant;
<PB N="17" REF="25">but it is &s;eldom made u&s;e of but by the chiefs, and by the&s;e not often; for drunkenne&s;s to them is abominable: their method of procuring this juice is di&s;gu&s;ting, and an exception to their natural cleanline&s;s. The root is chewed by &s;e|veral per&s;ons till it is &s;oft and pulpy, it is then &s;pit out into a ve&s;&s;el, and diluted with water and &s;trained, and in this &s;tate it is drank.</P>
<P>When they &s;it down to meat, it is on the ground, in the manner of the Per&s;ians, with a large quantity of leaves &s;pread by way of a cloth. Their provi&s;ion is brought in ba&s;kets, with two cocoa-nut &s;hells, one containing &s;alt water, the other fre&s;h. No one pre&s;umes to eat, till he has wa&s;hed his hands and mouth, which he does often in the cour&s;e of the meal. They carve their meat with &s;hells, cutting from them, and feed them&s;elves with their fin|gers, and will eat an immoderate quantity, enough to fill five or &s;ix Europeans: but what is remarkable, they always eat alone, not from want of &s;ociablene&s;s, but from a notion that it is right &s;o to do. If a family are to dine, each will have his &s;eparate provi&s;ion, and they will fit them&s;elves down at three or four yards di&s;tance from each other, and turn their faces different
<PB N="18" REF="26">ways, and not a word &s;hall be heard through the whole meal.</P>

<HEAD>Habitations.</HEAD>
<P>THE huts of the&s;e people con&s;i&s;t merely of a roof, &s;up|ported on three rows of pillars, one at each &s;ide, and one in the middle, and thatched with the leaves of the palm-tree; their hou&s;es are form|ed like our hay-ricks, with their roofs &s;loping both ways, the eaves of the roof about three or four feet from the ground; they have &s;eldom any walls, but are open at the &s;ides and ends; &s;ome few are enclo&s;ed with reeds, having only a hole to enter in at, which can be &s;hut up with a board; but the&s;e are the habitations of the principal people. Within, they are very neatly bedded with a kind of &s;traw, or hay, on which they lay mats to &s;leep on; re&s;ting their head on a block, or four-legged &s;tool, by way of pillow. When dark, they burn a kind of candle, made of the kernels of an oily nut, many of which they &s;tick upon a &s;mall piece of &s;tick like a &s;kewer, one over another; when the fir&s;t is burnt down, the one below it takes fire, and &s;o to the bottom. They &s;eldom &s;it up longer than an hour after it is dark; and when
<PB N="19" REF="27">they have any &s;trangers with them they burn a light the whole night; probably, as the whole family &s;leep together, that nothing improper may pa&s;s. Their huts are enclo&s;ed by a low reed fence, and &s;ome of them are &s;urrounded with little plantations. They are principally u&s;ed indeed for &s;leeping in, for unle&s;s the wea|ther is bad they take their meals upon the ground without or under the &s;helter of a neigh|bouring tree. The mantle that clothes them in the day covers them at night, and the whole family &s;leeps upon the &s;ame floor without the lea&s;t partition. The ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion and his wife in the middle, next to them tho&s;e who are married, along &s;ide of tho&s;e the &s;ingle wo|men, and at a little di&s;tance from the&s;e the &s;ingle men. The &s;ervants &s;leep without, unle&s;s it rains, in this ca&s;e they ju&s;t creep beneath the roof.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem &s;trange that a whole family &s;hould thus &s;leep together in common; but when it is con&s;idered that the people of this i&s;land have not the lea&s;t idea of indelicacy, but gratify every pa&s;&s;ion publicly without any &s;en&s;e of impropriety, the wonder will cea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Amu&s;ements.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER meals, and during the heat of the day, elderly per|&s;ons of the better &s;ort lie down to &s;leep: in|deed eating and &s;leeping is their general way of pa&s;&s;ing time, for they have little to do but to procure them&s;elves food, and are a very indo|lent people; &s;o indolent as &s;ometimes not to feed them&s;elves. If they plant a few trees in the cour&s;e of their lives it is all that is expected from them. They are not however without the more &s;prightly amu&s;ements; &s;uch as mu&s;ic, dancing, wre&s;tling, &s;wimming and diving, which they do wonderfully, (both men, women, and children of &s;ix years old) throwing a lance and &s;hooting with a bow. In throwing the lance their ambition is to hit a mark at about twenty yards di&s;tance, and in u&s;ing the bow he is the be&s;t archer that conveys the arrow farthe&s;t; and as their arrows are not feathered, they will often &s;end them two hundred and eighty yards. When they draw the bow they kneel, and drop it as &s;oon as the arrow is delivered.</P>
<P>Their mu&s;ical in&s;truments are flutes only and drums: the flutes are made of the bamboo|cane about twelve inches long, with two holes only which they &s;top with the fir&s;t finger of the
<PB N="21" REF="29">left hand and the middle one of the right. Thus they have only four notes, and of the&s;e they &s;eem to have but one tune, and what is more remarkable, they &s;ound this in&s;trument in the manner of our German flute, by blowing through their no&s;trils.</P>
<P>The drum is cylindrical and formed of a hollow block of wood, &s;olid at one end and co|vered with the &s;kin of a &s;hark at the other. The&s;e they beat with their hands, and can tune them; they have a contrivance al&s;o to tune the flute, which they do by the ear with great ex|actne&s;s.</P>
<P>To the &s;ound of the&s;e in&s;truments they &s;ome|times &s;ing, and &s;ometimes dance. Their &s;ongs are in couplets, and frequently extemporaneous, and from their repeating them, &s;eem to be me|tre though without rhime. At other times they dance, and their way of dancing is not le&s;s &s;in|gular than their mu&s;ic, for they twi&s;t and writhe their bodies into many extravagant and wanton po&s;tures, &s;pread their legs, and &s;et their arms a-kimbo, and at the &s;ame time di&s;tort their faces in a manner which no European can imitate. Much of the cleverne&s;s of the dances &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in the indelicacy of their attitudes, which exceeds all de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30">Wre&s;tling is al&s;o a public diver&s;ion, and is exhibited before the chief and principal people of the i&s;land. The following is a de&s;cription of one. When the &s;pectators are &s;eated round upon the ground, and a ring thus formed, the wre&s;t|lers are introduced, con&s;i&s;ting of eight or ten men &s;tripped all to the &s;a&s;h that &s;urrounds the wai&s;t. The&s;e pace &s;lowly round the area, and by &s;triking their left arm with the right hand, give the general challenge: particular chal|lenges are afterwards given, and each wre&s;tler &s;ingles out his competitor; but the conte&s;t, in|&s;tead of being kept up by &s;kill, &s;eems merely a conte&s;t of &s;trength, each trying to throw the other by catching hold of the thigh, the cloth, the hair, or any other part. When the fall is given, the victor receives a plaudit from the olde&s;t per&s;ons pre&s;ent, and the conque&s;t is crowned by three huzzas. Two only wre&s;tle at a time; and when the conte&s;t of the&s;e are over, other two begin.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o dramatic entertainments, a kind of regular interlude performed by men and women, divided into three or four acts. The&s;e dramatic interludes are called by the i&s;landers <HI>Heava,</HI> and they con&s;i&s;t of dancing and come|dy, and la&s;t near two hours; the &s;ubject matter
<PB N="23" REF="31">of them is of a temporary nature, &s;uch as in|va&s;ions, repre&s;entations of women in labour, and the birth of the child, &amp;c. &amp;c. performed by men, and the child al&s;o by a man, and the dialogue is generally extemporaneous; but from their &s;ingular contortions and oddity of their actions, they are &s;ometimes very laughable. Sometimes the mu&s;icians will travel from one part of the i&s;land to the other, and entertain the inhabitants at their &s;everal hou&s;es, for which they are generally rewarded with &s;uch things as they may want and which the giver has to &s;pare.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal manufacture of this i&s;land is cloth, of which they have three &s;orts made of the bark of three different trees, one better than the other, though manufactured in the &s;ame way, by &s;oak|ing it in water and afterwards beating it out; and it &s;preads very fa&s;t under the beater. This done, it is bleached and often dyed red or yel|low with the juices of particular plants. The cloth thus made is thin, cool, and &s;oft, but like paper is ea&s;ily torn: they have a way how|ever of mending it, by pa&s;ting pieces over the
<PB N="24" REF="32">fracture. They al&s;o make matts by way of &s;um|mer covering.</P>
<P>They are likewi&s;e very ready in making ba&s;kets and wicker-work, which they do very expeditiou&s;ly. They will make ba&s;kets of the cocoa-nut leaves in a few minutes, and al&s;o bon|nets to &s;hade their faces from the &s;un, not &s;uch bonnets as cover the head, but merely a &s;hade over the eyes which they tie round the head.</P>
<P>Of the bark of another tree they make ropes and lines from the &s;ize of a packthread to that of an inch in diameter. Of the&s;e they form their fi&s;hing-nets and tackle, and of the fibres of the cocoa-nut they make thread. The fi&s;h|hooks, as I &s;aid before, are made of mother of pearl; and they make a kind of harpoon of cane, pointing them with hard wood, for they have no metal of any &s;ort.</P>

<HEAD>Tools.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR tools in general are made with &s;hells and &s;tone, and with the&s;e they will erect hou&s;es, build canoes, and after their manner carve images. They make an adze with &s;tone, a chi&s;el of human bone, a ra&s;p of coral, and coral &s;and &s;erves them as a file or poli&s;her.</P>

<HEAD>Boats.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR canoes are of two kinds, one for &s;hort trips called <HI>Ivahah,</HI> and the other for longer voyages called a <HI>Pahie.</HI> The fir&s;t are of various &s;izes, and u&s;ed for various purpo&s;es, fighting, fi&s;hing and travel|ling; their &s;ides are perpendicular, and their bottoms flat, and they are of different breadths, but not proportionable to their length, which is from &s;eventy-two feet to ten. Tho&s;e of ten feet long are about twelve inches wide, and tho&s;e of &s;eventy-two feet in length are about twenty-three inches in width.</P>
<P>The fighting canoe is the longe&s;t; the head and &s;tern are rai&s;ed in a &s;emicircular form with a carved image on the top, &s;eventeen or eighteen feet above the &s;ides of the boat, which are &s;eldom more than about thirty inches in height. Two of the&s;e canoes are always fa&s;tened toge|ther at the di&s;tance of three feet, by &s;trong poles la&s;hed to the &s;ides. Upon the&s;e in the fore-part is erected a &s;tage about eleven or twelve feet long, like the quarter deck of a &s;hip, and rather wider than the canoes, &s;up|ported by pillars about &s;ix feet high. On the&s;e &s;tages &s;tand the warriors, and from hence they throw their lances; their bows and arrows being
<PB N="26" REF="34">u&s;ed only for diver&s;ion. They al&s;o make u&s;e of &s;lings. Below the&s;e &s;tages, which &s;ome|times cover the whole canoe, &s;it the rowers, &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen in number, who paddle on with oars re&s;embling a baker's peel, and the &s;pare men, who when any are wounded on the platform above, exchange places with them. The fi&s;hing canoe is from ten to forty feet in length, and &s;ometimes carries a &s;ail; and the travelling canoes are always u&s;ed in pairs, and have generally a &s;mall hou&s;e &s;ix or &s;even feet &s;quare, built on a &s;tage in the fore-part of them, and &s;ometimes only an awning; for in fine weather they go a plea&s;uring in the&s;e boats, a number together, and make a good appear|ance. At the&s;e times the ve&s;&s;els are decorated with &s;treamers, and the people on board are dre&s;&s;ed; tho&s;e who row and &s;teer are dre&s;&s;ed in white, tho&s;e who &s;it upon the awning and under it, in white and red; and two men mounted on the prow of each canoe, in red only.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pahie</HI> or canoe for longer voyages, is bow &s;ided, and made with a keel at bottom; they are from thirty to &s;ixty feet in length but very narrow, &s;carce two feet wide. The&s;e are &s;ometimes u&s;ed double, and are furni&s;hed with &s;tages for fighting, or other purpo&s;es.
<PB N="27" REF="35">Some of the&s;e have one ma&s;t, and &s;ome two, and have &s;ails of matting pointed at top, &s;quare at bottom, and curved at the &s;ide, re|&s;embling what is called a &s;houlder of mutton &s;ail. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els have been out at &s;ea for eighteen or twenty days together, and might be longer, if they could &s;tow &s;ufficient provi&s;ions. When not in u&s;e they are drawn upon land, and are carefully kept under a covering of thatch, open only at the ends.</P>
<P>When De Quiros touched here in 1606, the &s;ails appeared to be <HI>latine</HI> made of palms, and the &s;eams joined with thongs compo&s;ed of the &s;ame wood.</P>

<P>WHERE food is &s;imple, and there is little debauchery, there can be but few di&s;orders: the principal di&s;|ea&s;es of this i&s;land are cutaneous eruptions, eri|&s;ipelas, ulcers, and a kind of lepro&s;y. Tho&s;e afflicted with the la&s;t, &s;eclude them&s;elves from &s;ociety, and live in a &s;mall hou&s;e alone. Phy|&s;icians they have none. They run to the prie&s;t for cure, who generally makes u&s;e only of a charm and incantation. This ceremony is per|formed till the patient recovers or dies. If he recovers, they attribute it to the prie&s;t, if he dies, to the incurablene&s;s of the di&s;order. In dangerous ca&s;es, the neare&s;t relations a&s;&s;emble in the &s;ick man's hou&s;e, and continue nur&s;ing and watching him, by turns, till he dies or is out of danger. Bleeding is u&s;ed in this i&s;land, but this is done by a prie&s;t, in the <HI>Sagittal</HI> vein on the head, the operation being perform|ed with a &s;harp wooden in&s;trument; when a &s;ufficient quantity of blood is taken away, they tie the head round with a bandage, which clo&s;es the orifice.</P>

<HEAD>Di&s;po&s;al of the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two kinds of depo&s;it for the dead in this i&s;land, one called a <HI>Tupapow,</HI> which is little le&s;s than a &s;hed, under which the fle&s;h is &s;uffered to putrefy; and the other called a <HI>Mo|rai,</HI> a kind of enclo&s;ure, with pyramidical erections of &s;tone, where the bones are after|wards interred; and the chief ambition of the&s;e people &s;eems to be in the magnificence of their <HI>Morai.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as any one dies, the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed is crowded with relations. Such as are neare&s;t of kin, and are truly affected by the lo&s;s are &s;ilent, the re&s;t are clamorous, at one moment with lamentations, and the next with laughing and vociferous talking; for true grief always ties the tongue. Thus is the remainder of the day and &s;ucceeding night &s;pent, and in the morning the body is wrapt in a cloth and
<PB N="31" REF="39">conveyed on a bier to the &s;ea &s;ide, attended by a prie&s;t; there it is &s;et down upon the beach, clo&s;e to the water, and the prie&s;t prays and throws the water with his hands towards the body, but not to touch it. This ceremony is continued long enough till a hou&s;e is built, and a &s;mall &s;pot of ground near it railed in. With|in the rails po&s;ts are &s;et up to &s;upport the bier, under a &s;hed or covering erected for the pur|po&s;e, where the body is left covered with the cloth to putrefy.</P>
<P>The body being thus depo&s;ited, the women a&s;&s;emble, and are conducted to the door of the hou&s;e ju&s;t mentioned by the neare&s;t relation, who wounds her&s;elf in the crown of her head, by pricking it with the tooth of a &s;hark, till it bleeds plentifully, this blood is taken upon a cloth and thrown under the bier; every woman pre&s;ent follows her example, and the ceremony continues two or three days. The tears like|wi&s;e that are &s;hed at the&s;e funeral rites, are wiped upon pieces of cloth, and appropriated to the &s;ame u&s;e, and &s;ome of the young folks cut off their hair, and offer it as oblations, on a pre&s;umption that the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed is hovering round the body, and ob&s;ervant of the love and fidelity of the mourners.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="40">When the women have performed their part, the men begin.

<P>The&s;e proce&s;&s;ions are not dropped till near the expiration of five months, when the remains of the dead body are taken down, and the bones &s;craped, wa&s;hed, and buried within or without
<PB N="33" REF="41">a <HI>Morai,</HI> or place of wor&s;hip, according to the di&s;tinction of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Even after this the prie&s;t continues for &s;ome time to pray for the departed, and is well re|warded by the &s;urviving relations, who, as their grief for the per&s;on decea&s;ed is &s;uppo&s;ed to wear out; &s;till vi&s;it the grave, more or le&s;s, and make occa&s;ional offerings upon the altars, &s;uch as food and bunches of feathers.</P>
<P>They go into mourning likewi&s;e, and call it <HI>Ceva.</HI> Their mourning con&s;i&s;ts of a veil over the face, and a certain head-dre&s;s of feathers. When mourners go abroad, they are preceded by &s;laves, who beat ca&s;tenets before them dolefully, giving notice of their approach to every one, who clears the way for them; but as mo&s;t good cu&s;toms are abu&s;ed, this is no le&s;s &s;o, for clearing the way and wearing a veil gives the married women an opportunity to intrigue, who frequently profit by the occa&s;ion. The whole nation mourns on the death of a &s;overeign, and mourning for a father is continued a length of time. Women mourn for their hu&s;bands, but this compliment is not returned them.</P>

<HEAD>Religion.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE can be &s;aid of their re|ligion, with any certainty, as none of the Europeans who have been there were &s;ufficiently acquainted with their language; in|deed, like the Chine&s;e, they have a different language to expre&s;s their religious my&s;teries by, from what is &s;poken in general. The only thing rightly under&s;tood is, that when the moon, in their eyes, wears a peculiar appear|ance, they &s;ay it is in a &s;tate of war, and at this time they have human &s;acrifices. The per&s;on to be offered up as the victim, is generally a bad man, one who, by his evil actions, becomes obnoxious to &s;ociety; but as the per&s;on thus to &s;uffer is fixed upon by the chief prie&s;t, it often happens that individuals fall a &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of this man, who, no doubt, has oratory &s;ufficient to repre&s;ent him as a villain. When the people a&s;&s;emble upon any &s;olemn occa&s;ion, the prie&s;t enters the <HI>Morai</HI> alone, and after &s;taying there a con&s;iderable time, he comes out and tells the multitude that he has &s;een and conver&s;ed with the &s;upreme Being, that he expects a human &s;acrifice, that &s;uch a one pre&s;ent is the man, and the poor wretch is
<PB N="35" REF="43">immediately beaten to death. At other times they &s;acrifice hogs, dogs, and fowls.</P>
<P>It appears, that the&s;e people conceive that every thing in nature does and did proceed from procreation. That the &s;upreme Deity, by con|junction with a rock, brought forth the year; that the year, by a connection with the Father of all, gave birth to the months, and the&s;e, by a further procreation among them&s;elves, the days. The &s;tars, plants, &amp;c. they &s;uppo&s;e to have obtained their exi&s;tence &s;omewhat in the &s;ame way. Their ridiculous and futile ima|gination leads them to believe that there are certain inferior divinities, whom they call <HI>Ea|tuas,</HI> two of whom fir&s;t inhabited the earth, and were the progenitors of the fir&s;t man, brought forth in the &s;hape of a ball, but moulded into the pre&s;ent form by his mother; that in&s;tinct led this fir&s;t man to beget children upon his mother, which children were females only, &s;o that it was many generations before he could get a &s;on, which at la&s;t he did out of one of his &s;i&s;ters, and thus peopled the earth.</P>
<P>Their inferior divinities, of which they have a great number, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be male and female. The men pay their adoration to the males, and the women to the females, and there
<PB N="36" REF="44">are <HI>Morais,</HI> or places of wor&s;hip, appropriated to both, where prie&s;ts officiate, but the&s;e prie&s;ts are men. Their deities are rather &s;uch as we under&s;tand by genii, of which they have good and bad, and they &s;uppo&s;e that a good or evil genius pre&s;ides over each important action of their lives, deciding its determinations whether it be &s;ucce&s;sful or not. In ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, they &s;eem to rely wholly upon the&s;e genii, and neglect any application for cure but to the prayers of the prie&s;ts, and thus &s;hew them|&s;elves &s;trong prede&s;tinarians.</P>
<P>They &s;o far believe the immortality of the &s;oul, as to &s;uppo&s;e that there are two &s;eparate &s;tates of exi&s;tence hereafter, which they conceive not to be places of rewards and puni&s;hments, but merely receptacles for the different cla&s;&s;es of men; they have no conception that their actions here below can influence their future &s;tate: and, therefore, as their view of immortality tends not to regulate their earthly conduct, their re|ligion mu&s;t be di&s;intere&s;ted, and their adora|tion ri&s;e from an humble &s;en&s;e of their own in|&s;ignificance, when compared to the perfection of their divinities.</P>
<P>The prie&s;thood here is hereditary; prie&s;ts are generally cho&s;en from &s;ome family of di&s;|tinction,
<PB N="37" REF="45">and have the highe&s;t authority, in|ferior only to the chief. They have a &s;uperior knowledge in religious my&s;teries, but that knowledge con&s;i&s;ts in naming and cla&s;&s;ing their deities, and pre&s;erving traditions. They know a little more of a&s;tronomy and navigation in|deed, and to them only is appropriated the office of <HI>tattowing,</HI> or puncturing the &s;kin, and circumci&s;ion, which with them is a &s;litting only of the <HI>prepuce,</HI> and adopted merely from motives of cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>Marriage is celebrated with &s;ome few cere|monies, but &s;eems to be nothing more than the mutual contract of man and woman, which is continued or di&s;&s;olved as the parties &s;hall agree, the prie&s;t having nothing to do with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Morai</HI> is not only a place of burial, but al&s;o, as I &s;aid before, a place of wor&s;hip; and to this place the Indian comes with the greate&s;t humility and reverence, with &s;low &s;teps and a dejected eye, in&s;pired with a &s;en&s;e of his own inferiority, and the exalted excellence of the Divinity he is going to adore; and in this act di&s;graces the generality of Chri&s;tians. Nay, they never pa&s;s a <HI>Morai</HI> but they uncover their &s;houlders as a mark of awful re&s;pect. The floor of this place within is paved; without, an
<PB N="38" REF="46">altar or two, re&s;embling tables, about &s;even feet high, are rai&s;ed pretty near the <HI>Morai,</HI> and both within the walls and without are a number of &s;mall wooden &s;tatues, uncouthly carved up|on the top of a piece of wood, which they &s;tick into the ground. They do not wor&s;hip the&s;e images, for they are by no means idolaters. This and the neighbouring i&s;lands hold parti|cular birds, indeed, in veneration, &s;ome a he|ron, others a king-fi&s;her, &s;omething in the &s;ame manner as we do the robin or the &s;wallow, but they pay not the lea&s;t adoration to them.</P>
<P>When a wor&s;hipper enters the <HI>Morai,</HI> or approaches the altar to make his offering, he &s;trips him&s;elf naked to the wai&s;t, and all his looks and actions declare an awful reverence for the place.</P>

<HEAD>Government.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the natives of O-Taheitee live under no re|gular form of government, yet a kind of feudal &s;y&s;tem &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among them. Each of the pe|nin&s;ulas has an <HI>Earee Rahie</HI> or &s;overeign, and each di&s;trict, of which there are forty-three in the two penin&s;ulas, has an <HI>Earee</HI> or chief, and the&s;e divide the lands within their terri|tories among their va&s;&s;als. The i&s;land former|ly
<PB N="39" REF="47">was under the command of one &s;overeign; the kings of Le&s;&s;er O-Taheitee being &s;prung from tho&s;e of the Greater: the two &s;overeigns at pre&s;ent are nearly related, and that of the former &s;eems as it were a tributary to the lat|ter. Each chief keeps a kind of court, and has a number of officers; and it is ob&s;ervable, that he &s;eldom gives his deci&s;ion in any ca&s;e, without the advice of council. If an of|fence was given at any time to the people by the Europeans that vi&s;ited them, the matter was to be adju&s;ted with the chief before a re|conciliation could be brought about. The male child of a chief, as well as of the &s;overeign, as &s;oon as born, &s;ucceeds to the title of its father, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the parent of all his honours except that of the management of the e&s;tate, &amp;c. and of conducting and carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s till the boy is of age.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of an attack, every di&s;trict furni&s;hes its proportion of fighting men, and the &s;overeign commands the whole. Their weapons are &s;lings, pikes, and clubs; when they fight it is with great ob&s;tinacy, and they give no quarter; but often kill their pri&s;oners, men, women and children, and carry off their jaw-bones as trophies, in like manner as the Indians of North America
<PB N="40" REF="48">do the &s;calps. If a di&s;pute at any time ari&s;es between two chiefs, it is &s;ettled among them|&s;elves. Captain Cook was once pre&s;ent at a naval review, and found it con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of three hundred large canoes completely equip|ped, and manned with near eight thou&s;and men; the chiefs and all tho&s;e on the fighting plat|forms, were habited in their war accoutrements, which con&s;i&s;ted of a great quantity of cloth, turbans, brea&s;t-plates, and unwieldy helmets. The canoes were dre&s;&s;ed with flags and &s;tream|ers. This fleet was de&s;igned to attack a neigh|bouring i&s;land that had thrown off its indepen|dency on O-Taheitee. Some of the troops at Captain Cook's reque&s;t went through their ex|erci&s;e on &s;hore. Two parties fir&s;t began with clubs; the blows of the clubs were aimed at the legs and head, tho&s;e at the legs were evaded by jumping; and tho&s;e at the head by &s;tooping, or leaping a&s;ide: when they proceeded to u&s;e their &s;pears or darts, they parried the pu&s;h or dart by fixing the point of a &s;pear in the ground before them, and directing the other end of it, as they fore&s;aw the aim was made.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch thing as money among them; the fruit of the trees are in common to all; the commerce of the &s;eas is no way re|&s;trained;
<PB N="41" REF="49">and there &s;eems to be few things that can be taken by violence or fraud. In a &s;tate therefore where there is but little oppo&s;i|tion of intere&s;t, every pa&s;&s;ion being &s;o readily gratified, there cannot be many crimes; of cour&s;e a regular di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice will be unnece&s;&s;ary. It is true there are thefts here, but as none among the&s;e people can be much injured or benefited by &s;uch thefts, they are not re&s;trained by any public law, but the puni&s;h|ment of the criminal re&s;ts with the injured per|&s;on. They do not &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to rob one another, but they made no &s;cruple of &s;tealing from the Europeans, whenever they had an op|portunity; even the chiefs would &s;toop to pur|loin a nail or a piece of gla&s;s bottle; but when it is con&s;idered that an Indian among iron and gla&s;s is in the &s;ame &s;tate of temptation with the poore&s;t European among unlocked boxes of jewels and gold, it is not to be wondered at. To rate the virtue of the&s;e people properly, we mu&s;t take a view of their moral &s;y&s;tem, which is ever to conform to what they think right. If they have any notions of right and wrong, they mu&s;t proceed from the mere dictates of na|ture, for le&s;&s;ons they have none on this head; and as theft among them&s;elves is attended but
<PB N="42" REF="50">with little di&s;advantage to the injured per&s;on, they think very little of it. In this light they con&s;idered nails and other things to Captain Cook and his people, and thought no wrong in making free with what they pre&s;umed the per|&s;ons they took them from could not mi&s;s. Adultery is &s;ometimes heard of in this i&s;land; and if the parties are caught in the act, the man perhaps is in&s;tantly &s;lain by the injured hu&s;band, if he is the &s;tronge&s;t of the two, and the wife e&s;capes with a beating: It &s;eldom hap|pens that the chiefs interfere. Murder indeed is &s;ometimes puni&s;hed with death, and the cri|minal in this ca&s;e is hanged.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction of rank pre&s;erved in this i&s;land does not materially affect the happine&s;s of the people. In a country where &s;carce a &s;econd garment is nece&s;&s;ary, where every one can ga|ther fruit from the fir&s;t tree he meets, or is at liberty to take &s;ome in any hou&s;e which he enters; where the nece&s;&s;aries of life can be ea&s;ily obtained; there can be but little envy, but little repining. The upper cla&s;s of people, it is true, enjoy &s;ome dainties which the lower cla&s;s probably cannot get at; this may hurt an individual, but cannot affect a nation at large. The di&s;tinction between the greate&s;t and the
<PB N="43" REF="51">lowe&s;t man in O-Taheitee is not more than between a manufacturer in England and his workman. A chief has the command of life and death over his &s;ervants and &s;laves; but he very &s;eldom exerci&s;es it, and notwith|&s;tanding this, is more beloved than feared; a proof of the mildne&s;s of their government. He alone has power to plant the Babylonian willow before his hou&s;e; for by bending down the branches of this tree, and planting them in the ground, they will &s;hoot afre&s;h; thus the &s;hade may be extended to any di&s;tance, and in any direction. Under the&s;e &s;hady arches the chiefs regale, who&s;e &s;ervants are known by wearing &s;a&s;hes high up under the arms, which others wear only round their middle. When a chief approaches, or pa&s;&s;es, it is cu&s;tomary for all to uncover their &s;houlders as a compli|ment; but this is all: the meane&s;t man in the i&s;land addre&s;&s;es his &s;overeign as freely as he would an equal, and can &s;ee him whenever he plea&s;es: for, not depraved by the empty notions of European greatne&s;s, the king will often amu&s;e him&s;elf with his &s;ubjects, and at times will paddle in his own canoe.</P>

<HEAD>Character and Cu&s;toms.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid of the&s;e peo|ple, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that cha&s;tity here is in much repute. Their natural &s;implicity is &s;o great, that the very conjugal rites are per|formed in public, a whole family or hou&s;hold re&s;ting at night in one room. In more north|ern climates, girls and unmarried women are &s;uppo&s;ed to be ignorant of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the marriage-bed, but here it &s;eems to be the very rever&s;e. Among their dances, where eight or ten young &s;ingle women can be got together, they have one which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch wanton and la&s;civious ge&s;ticulations, accompanied by ob|&s;cene di&s;cour&s;e, that one is led to think that &s;uch ge&s;tures and expre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be taught them at the earlie&s;t age; but they are no &s;ooner married, than they leave off this fooli&s;h prac|tice. Some of the principal women of the i&s;land introduced them&s;elves to Captain Cook, and his officers, by &s;everal times taking up all their garments round them, quite to the wai&s;t; and as where there is no idea of indelicacy with re&s;pect to actions, there can be none in words, their language is gro&s;sly ob&s;cene, and as freely &s;poken by the women as the men.
<PB N="45" REF="53">The women in general are very lively in their conver&s;ation, and very chatty, and they have vivacity and under&s;tanding often to be witty and to play upon words.</P>
<P>To give the reader a &s;till better idea of their want of decency, and to convince him, that it does not ari&s;e from depravity of &s;entiment, but from an innate &s;implicity authorized by cu&s;tom, I need only mention, that when Cap|tain Cook was there in the year 1769, and then on a vi&s;it to the queen of the i&s;land, &s;he entertained him with an exhibition of a very &s;ingular kind, and among the &s;pectators were many women of di&s;tinction. A young man of uncommon &s;tature was directed by her to per|form the rites of Venus, with a little girl about twelve years old, which was done without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of impropriety on either &s;ide; and though the girl &s;eemed to want no in&s;tructions in the office, her Maje&s;ty vouch&s;afed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the ceremony.</P>
<P>But though the unmarried are &s;o little re|&s;erved, they no &s;ooner take a partner for life, than they are as choice of their favours as be|fore they are free of them; and if we con&s;ider the &s;implicity, both of their education and dre&s;s, we cannot ju&s;tly charge them with the crime of
<PB N="46" REF="54">unbounded licentiou&s;ne&s;s. There are &s;ome wo|men of the better &s;ort, and &s;ome few even of the lower cla&s;s, that are in this re&s;pect very re|&s;erved; all I would infer is, that freedoms of the kind I mentioned, are not con&s;idered here as crimes of &s;uch a nature as to preclude them from &s;ociety; and as a further proof of it, it need only be told, that a very re&s;pectable chief offered his wife to Captain Cook, in ex|change for a few red feathers, and &s;he, by the or|ders of her hu&s;band, took &s;ome pains, by a &s;tu|died di&s;play of her charms, though artfully con|cealed, to captivate him. But, to &s;hew that they are delicate in their notions, notwith&s;tand|ing this freedom of conduct, and that it is not every man with whom they will a&s;&s;ort, take the following little anecdote. When Captain Cook was there in 1774, he had on board his ve&s;&s;el a weak &s;corbutic man, with one eye, who, &s;oon after his arrival, gaining a little &s;trength and &s;pirits upon a vegetable diet, paid his addre&s;&s;es to a plea&s;ing O-Taheitean girl, lighted a candle and conducted her from the deck to his birth below; but &s;he no &s;ooner looked in his face, and found that he had lo&s;t an eye, than &s;he refu&s;ed to continue with him, led him upon deck again, introduced him to a one-eyed girl,
<PB N="47" REF="55">at that time there, and gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;he was a more &s;uitable partner for him; for that, for her part, &s;he would not take up with a blind lover.</P>
<P>But as in every country there are &s;ome more di&s;&s;olute than others, &s;o is it in O-Taheitee: there is a &s;ociety formed here of a great number of the principal people of the i&s;land, of both &s;exes, called an <HI>Arreoy;</HI> where, to indulge their pa&s;&s;ions, and keep up their flame by a plea&s;ing variety, every woman is common to every man; and where, in order to &s;timulate de&s;ire, frequent meetings are held among them, at which time the men wre&s;tle, and the women dance, and en|deavour, by the mo&s;t wanton ge&s;tures, to incite tho&s;e amorous pa&s;&s;ions that probably could not be kept alive any other way; and the pa&s;&s;ion once rai&s;ed, is immediately gratified. This cu&s;tom may po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;onant with their peculiar notions; but the &s;equel is horrid. Should any of the&s;e women prove pregant, which does not often happen, the poor infant is &s;mothered as &s;oon as born, that it may be no interruption to tho&s;e diabolical plea&s;ures of the father and mother, who, if the child is pre|&s;erved, are immediately excluded the &s;ociety: and the members of this a&s;&s;ociation, in&s;tead of be|ing
<PB N="48" REF="56">a&s;hamed of the connection, pride them&s;elves in it, and boa&s;t of it as a privilege.</P>
<P>But as the natives of this i&s;land have the ge|neral character of being gentle, generous, ten|der, and affectionate, which cannot be recon|ciled with the murder of their own children; there may be other rea&s;ons than unbounded li|centiou&s;ne&s;s to countenance this &s;ociety: and as all the men who are members of it are warriors, &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation may be political, as it ob|viates the attachments of both wife and child. Be&s;ides, &s;uch a &s;ociety might be in&s;tituted to prevent multiplying the chiefs of the i&s;land, who perhaps once were petty-tyrants, e&s;pecially, as a child brought forth in wedlock is a chief as &s;oon as born; and the members of this a&s;&s;ocia|tion were generally chiefs and are now per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. This &s;ociety may thus have been in&s;tituted in &s;ound policy, and the re&s;pect it is held in, in the i&s;land, &s;eems to favour the notion; but as all in&s;titutions, in cour&s;e of time, are liable to abu&s;e, it may be the ca&s;e here; for the members &s;eem to meet merely to indulge a voluptuous di&s;po&s;i|tion. They fea&s;t on the choice&s;t dainties, and that to exce&s;s; they make a free u&s;e of the in|toxicating plant; they are amu&s;ed with mu&s;ic,
<PB N="49" REF="57">and la&s;civious dancing, and a train of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures &s;urrounds them. But, at the &s;ame time, they are friendly and ho&s;pitable to each other in the highe&s;t degree, and, to &s;often the crime of murder on the part of the mother, it is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that they never give up their children but at the entreaties and per&s;ua|&s;ions of the re&s;t, and where entreaties will not prevail, force is employed, and the murder is committed in &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Polygamy is not allowed among them, ex|cept among the principal people of the i&s;land. Love being the reigning pa&s;&s;ion, a number of wives is the highe&s;t luxury. The women pay a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their hu&s;bands, and though an exception is now and then to be found to the general rule, they would &s;ooner die than be guilty of conjugal infidelity; and &s;o little is jealou&s;y known among them, that when a woman yields to the importunities of a &s;tranger, it is generally by the hu&s;band's per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the reader probably will wi&s;h to know the reception the fir&s;t European ve&s;&s;el met with at this i&s;land, I will relate what happened to Cap|tain Wallis in June 1767, for, till this time, no European &s;hip had touched there, except that of De Quiros in 1606; and he continued there not
<PB N="50" REF="58">more than two days; be&s;ides, it being more than a century and a half ago, the vi&s;it of Cap|tain Wallis may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t which the natives of this i&s;land ever received from a civilized people.</P>
<P>When Captain Wallis's &s;hip brought up clo&s;e under the land, which the depth of water enabled him to do, he was &s;oon &s;urrounded by &s;ome hundreds of canoes, with &s;everal per&s;ons in each. When they came within pi&s;tol &s;hot, they gazed and &s;eemed to hold a council how to act; at la&s;t they paddled round the ve&s;&s;el, ex|hibiting &s;ignals of friend&s;hip, and one of them made a &s;peech. Soon after this, &s;ome few came on board, but one of them being butted by a goat then on deck, and on turnign round &s;ee|ing the goat ri&s;e on his legs, they all jumped over the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el, in the greate&s;t fright, but &s;oon &s;wam round her and returned on board again, and the crew had enough to do to prevent their &s;tealing &s;undry things that lay in their way; one of them &s;natched off a gold|laced hat from an officer's head, leaped over|board, and &s;wam off with it. Upon the Cap|tain's &s;ending out a boat to &s;ound the depth of water, the Indians, to prevent their coming on &s;hore, threw &s;tones into her, and wounded &s;ome
<PB N="51" REF="59">of the men, which made an officer in the boat fire his mu&s;quet, loaded with buck-&s;hot, at the Indian who threw the fir&s;t &s;tone, and wounded him on the &s;houlder. This was an alarm &s;uf|ficient&mdash;it brought together three or four hun|dred canoes, with upwards of two thou&s;and men, armed with &s;lings, and &s;tones, of two pounds weight, who attacked the &s;hip, and hurt &s;ome of the crew, but they were &s;oon quieted and di&s;per&s;ed by firing a few great guns at them, with the lo&s;s only of a few Indians: they pre|pared for a &s;econd attack, but found it in vain; in &s;hort, they became &s;o afraid of a gun, that was a mu&s;quet pointed at them, thou&s;ands would fly before it, like a flock of &s;heep. Indeed, &s;o great was their dread, that when a party of In|dians once attempted to attack an officer, then &s;trolling about on &s;hore by him&s;elf, he put them all to flight, by pre&s;enting his tooth-pick ca&s;e at them, which they conceived to be a little gun. After this the &s;hip's boats went peace|ably to &s;hore, and upon &s;ignals of friend&s;hip made on both &s;ides, a trade was opened with the i&s;landers, which improved every day. The things they valued mo&s;t were nails and hatchets, they having no &s;uch thing as iron among them; and the rates of trafficking were, a &s;pike for a
<PB N="52" REF="60">&s;mall pig, a &s;maller for a fowl, a hatchet for a hog, and a middling-&s;ized nail for twenty co|coa-nuts or bread-fruit. Nay, they trafficked with the &s;hips crew for the per&s;onal favours of their daughters and &s;i&s;ters, whom fathers and brothers brought down to the &s;ea-&s;ide on pur|po&s;e: a nail was generally the price of the&s;e fa|vours, but, to &s;hew that they were not in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;uperiority of charms in one female more than another, the &s;ize of the nail demanded ro&s;e always in proportion to the beauty of the lady; but no nails were current at O-Taheitee under the &s;ize of a forty-penny.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip had been there about three weeks, the Captain was introduced to a woman of di&s;tinction among them. She invited him to her hou&s;e, and taking hold of his hand, made all her attendants, of which there were a great number, both male and female, ki&s;s it.&mdash;When any of the natives meet a friend, whom they have not &s;een for &s;ome time, they affect to cry for joy; but no &s;uch ceremonial pa&s;&s;ed here; they ki&s;&s;ed the Captain's hand. This lady's hou&s;e was merely a roof, thatched with palm leaves, like other habitations in the i&s;land, but covering a &s;pot of ground three hundred and twenty-&s;even feet long, and forty-two feet in
<PB N="53" REF="61">breadth; it was rai&s;ed upon three rows of pillars, thirty-nine on each &s;ide, and fourteen in the middle. The ridge of the hou&s;e within was thirty feet high, and the &s;ides of it, to the eaves of the thatch, twelve feet high. As Captain Wallis and his party entered, &s;he beckoned four girls, by waving her hand downwards, that being the method there, and ordered them to take off the Captain's &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and then directed the girls to rub and chafe their feet between their hands. This is con&s;idered at O-Taheitee, and is in reality the greate&s;t re|fre&s;hment. When the young women had conti|nued this for about half an hour, they dre&s;&s;ed their legs again, and, by the order of their mi&s;|tre&s;s, brought &s;ome bales of cloth, of their own manufacturing, to clothe them in the fa&s;hion of the country, but they declined it. This done, the Queen pre&s;ented them with a &s;ow big with pig, and conducted them to the &s;hore where the boats lay; and, what is remark|able, at every little dirty place they pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he took the Captain up in her arms and lifted him over, with as little difficulty as we would lift a child. During this vi&s;it, one of the gentlemen took off his wig, to wipe his head, having walked till he was warm, which &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed
<PB N="54" REF="62">the Indians, that they could not have been more &s;o, had his limbs been &s;crewed to his body, and he had un&s;crewed them one after another.</P>
<P>As a general character of the&s;e people; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that they are ho&s;pitable, un|ambitious, and far from revengeful. They probably are not &s;o &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, as from appearances might be expected; for they weep upon every little oc|ca&s;ion, and &s;eem to have tears at will; like children they cry for trifles, and like children too their &s;orrows are &s;oon forgotten: but when we reflect, that they have never been taught either to di&s;gui&s;e or &s;uppre&s;s their pa&s;&s;ions, and are not accu&s;tomed to thought, which alone only can recall the pa&s;t and anticipate the future, it is no wonder that their &s;orrows &s;hould be tran&s;ient; they are affected only with the occur|rence of the pa&s;&s;ing minute; and yet they are of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition. Their life re|&s;embles, in a great mea&s;ure, what poets call the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> for they are happy in their &s;im|plicity and innocence; and if the frequent vi|&s;its of Europeans do not corrupt their manners, may continue &s;o to the end of time. Though they have no trade, they have plenty of amu&s;e|ments and employments; manufacturing of
<PB N="55" REF="63">their dre&s;s is an agreeable employ to the wo|men, and building hou&s;es and canoes, with making of tools and arms, &s;ufficient occupa|tion for the men. Mo&s;t of their days are &s;pent in a country where nature has been lavi&s;h of her gifts; where the temperature of the air is warm, but continually refre&s;hed by whole&s;ome breezes; where the atmo&s;phere is con&s;tantly clear and &s;erene, and where the climate and fruits of the land contribute to the &s;trength, the plea&s;ure, and elegance of the natives. In &s;hort, their tempers are unruffled by violent pa&s;&s;ions; they live a life of ea&s;e, equanimity, and content, and are &s;ituated in a delightful country, free from care, and happy in their ignorance; re|&s;embling the paradi&s;e of Mahomet, where the appetites are gratified, without ever being cloyed.</P>
<P>When M. De Bouganville was at O-Taheitee, he met with a native of that i&s;land, about thirty years of age, very de&s;irous of accompanying him to France, and his countrymen &s;eemed to approve the &s;tep. He happened, however, to be a &s;tupid fellow, and in two years &s;tay at Paris, could never get to &s;peak, or even pro|nounce the language; po&s;&s;ibly from &s;ome im|pediment in his &s;peech, yet &s;till, he would go
<PB N="56" REF="64">out into the &s;treets by him&s;elf, and was well acquainted with the town. He frequently made a purcha&s;e, and &s;eldom paid more for it than its value. The principal exhibition that plea&s;ed him was the opera, and particularly the dancing; he con&s;tantly went there by him|&s;elf, paid for his admi&s;&s;ion, and his favourite place was in the &s;eats behind the boxes. Among the great number de&s;irous of &s;eeing him, he knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who were mo&s;t civil, and his grateful heart never forgot them. The Duche&s;s of Choi&s;eul appropriated a &s;um of money for the purpo&s;e of conveying a va|riety of tools to O-Taheitee, and the mini&s;try &s;ent him, in March 1770, to the I&s;le of France, that he might be thence conveyed home; but he never lived to reach his native i&s;le, for having caught the &s;mall-pox, it proved fatal to him. M. De Bouganville allotted one thou|&s;and five hundred pounds, being a third part of his fortune, towards equipping the &s;hip for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>Bolabola lies N.

There is
<PB N="58" REF="66">very little difference in any of the&s;e i&s;lands, re|&s;pecting the cu&s;toms, manners, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the inhabitants: I &s;hall therefore &s;peak only of Huaheine and Ulietea, and that but little.

<P>Some years &s;ince, the Chiefs of O-Taheitee, and other neighbouring i&s;les, bani&s;hed &s;uch as were guilty of thefts and other crimes, not de&s;erving death, to that of Bolabola, which till then was uninhabited.

<HEAD>HUAHEINE, OR HUAHENE</HEAD>
<P>IS &s;ituated in &s;outh latitude, 16&deg; 43&prime;, and 150&deg; 52&prime; we&s;t longitude. It lies thirty-one leagues N. W. of O-Taheitee, and is about &s;even leagues round. The face of it is hilly and uneven, and it has on the we&s;t a &s;afe and commodious harbour. It was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Captain Cook on the 11th of July, 1769.</P>
<P>Huaheine is divided by a deep inlet into two penin&s;ulas, joined by an i&s;tmus which is over|flowed at high water. Its hills are not &s;o lofty as tho&s;e at O-Taheitee, but, like the hills of that i&s;land, they &s;eem to be the remains of a volcano: the top of one has the appearance of a crater, and a kind of lava is very con&s;picuous on one of its &s;ides.</P>
<P>The face of the country is &s;imilar to that of O-Taheitee, but in a le&s;s &s;cale, though it is con&s;iderably more picture&s;que; the &s;ides of the hills being here cultivated, owing to a &s;carcity of level ground. From the principal bay, the i&s;lands of Ulietea, Otaha, and Bola|bola may be &s;een; the la&s;t appears like a coni|cal hill, forked at the top.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="68">The natives &s;peak the &s;ame language, wear the &s;ame habits, and are the &s;ame as the O-Taiheteans, except that they are not &s;o dark|coloured: The women in general are as hand|&s;ome, and both women and men rather &s;touter, larger made, and le&s;s timid; but if any thing they are more indolent and lazy.</P>
<P>The productions likewi&s;e of this i&s;land are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the la&s;t-mentioned, but are about a month forwarder in their growth. They have here indeed mulberry-trees, which are not to be met with at O-Taheitee. Of the cocoa-nuts, the inhabitants make a food, by &s;craping them and mixing them with yams, and eating it, &s;o as to re&s;emble a kind of oily ha&s;ty-pudding. There are a great quantity of ducks, curlews, and &s;nipes, and here are &s;ome in&s;ects and &s;corpions, and the &s;ame animals which are found at O-Taheitee. Notwith|&s;tanding the &s;tupidity of the dogs, they are in high favour with the women, who are &s;o ridi|culou&s;ly fond of them, that they will &s;uckle the puppies at their brea&s;ts. The dogs in general, of the&s;e i&s;lands, are of various &s;izes, from that of a lap-dog to the &s;ize of a large &s;paniel. The head is broad, and pointed at the no&s;e, the eyes are &s;mall, the ears upright,
<PB N="61" REF="69">the hair lank and hard, and the colour mo&s;tly brown and white; and they &s;eldom bark, but often howl and &s;eem to have an aver&s;ion to &s;trangers. Their method of killing them for food, both here and at O-Taheitee, is by &s;tifling them, either by &s;topping their fundament with gra&s;s, and holding their no&s;e and mouth be|tween their hands till they die, or by laying them on their backs and pre&s;&s;ing their throats with a &s;tick till they are choaked.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements and cu&s;toms of this i&s;land are al&s;o the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the la&s;t-men|tioned. They have their <HI>Heava</HI> or dramatic en|tertainments, and al&s;o their <HI>Arreoy,</HI> or licentious &s;ociety; but parents do not here &s;uffer their daughters to follow their own inclinations. A reciprocal changing of names is here a friendly ceremony, and when they accept a pre&s;ent, as they do at O-Taheitee, they lift it always above their heads.</P>
<P>Huaheine is governed al&s;o by chiefs related to tho&s;e at O-Taheitee, and the religious notions of this place, and indeed of all the neighbouring i&s;les, is much the &s;ame as that which has been there de&s;cribed, excepting that each i&s;land as a &s;eparate theogony, calling their deities by dif|ferent names. They believe every man to have
<PB N="62" REF="70">a di&s;tinct being within him, who acts according to the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;en&s;es. This being they &s;uppo&s;e to be immortal, and after the death of the per&s;on they inhabit, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and lodge in, the wooden images that de|corate their <HI>Morai,</HI> or places of burial. They conceive both &s;un and moon to be inhabited by its re&s;pective divinity, and &s;o far pay them adoration, as they &s;uppo&s;e them to have an in|fluence on things below. Their good or evil genii, are addre&s;&s;ed, in proportion to the good or ill they do; the good are &s;upplicated by prayers, and the evil are revered by hi&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>In a word, it would be unju&s;t to their ge|neral character if I did not &s;ay, that, notwith|&s;tanding their errors and cu&s;toms, incon&s;i&s;tent with European nations, they po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t exalted &s;entiments, &s;entiments that do honour to mankind; and though various characters are found among all nations, for one villain in the&s;e i&s;les there are fifty to be found in a civi|lized country. They are friendly and ho&s;pita|ble without &s;eeming to know it, and leave their virtues to be recorded by &s;trangers who vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>When Captain Fourneaux was at this i&s;land in 1773, he at the reque&s;t of a young man at<PB N="63" REF="71">that time there, brought him away, to &s;hew him to the people of England, as M. de Bouganville did a native of O-Taheitee to Paris. This man's name is Omai, a native of Ulietea; he is of the middling cla&s;s of people, and had &s;ome property there, but was plundered of it by the inhabitants of Bolabola. He is far from being a &s;pecimen of the na|tives of the&s;e i&s;lands, they being in general much fairer, much hand&s;omer, and much better made. He is a man however of quick parts, hone&s;t principles, and a good under&s;tanding. He continued two years in England under the patronage of Lord Sandwich, Dr. Solander, and Mr. Banks. While here, he was introduced into the be&s;t company, conducted to every &s;plendid entertainment, and frequently was led to court, and taken uncommon notice of by his Maje&s;ty. He fell in with that elegance and ea&s;e natural to the polite people of the age, and adopted the manners and amu&s;ements of tho&s;e with whom he a&s;&s;ociated. As a proof of his under&s;tanding, he &s;oon became a proficient in the game of che&s;s. No one here attempted to improve his under&s;tanding or his moral cha|racter; the only pains taken was to lead him into a round of fa&s;hionable enjoyments, and fea&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="72">his eyes with daily wonders. During his &s;tay here, he was inoculated for the &s;mall-pox, and when Captain Cook &s;ailed for O-Taheitee again in July 1776, Omai voluntarily went with him, though with manife&s;t regret, at leaving Eng|land. He carried with him a great variety of dre&s;&s;es, and other ornaments, a portable hand|organ, a puppet-&s;how, a coat of mail, a &s;uit of armour, and an electrical machine, which he was taught to u&s;e. Though at years of maturity, his judgmentw as &s;till in its infant &s;tate, and, like children, he coveted every thing he &s;aw: he did not carry with him any in&s;truments of real u&s;e in life; but a variety of dome&s;tic ani|mals, male and female, were put on board, as a pre&s;ent from Captain Cook to the inhabitants of O-Taheitee, and the other South Sea i&s;lands.</P>

<P>The manner of the principal peoples re|ceiving a vi&s;it of ceremony here, is al&s;o differ|end from what has been mentioned el&s;ewhere, which is, being &s;eated within their habitations,
<PB N="66" REF="74">at the end of a long mat, and the party intro|duced by four or five old women weeping, and, as it were, bitterly lamenting, and cutting their heads with in&s;truments made of the teeth of a &s;hark, till the blood runs plentifully down their faces and &s;houlders; before the vi&s;itor en|ters, the&s;e women embrace him, and thus fre|quently be&s;mear him with their blood. This ceremony ended, they go and wa&s;h them&s;elves and immediately appear as chearful as any of the company.</P>
<P>The dances and dramatic entertainments in this i&s;land al&s;o are very &s;ingular; in one hou&s;e, where Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks paid a vi&s;it, by order of the ma&s;ter, a man with a large cy|lindrical piece of wicker-work upon his head, about four feet long, and eight inches in diame|ter, faced with feathers, placed perpendicularly, and edged round with &s;harks teeth, began to dance. In dancing, he often twi&s;ted his head in &s;uch a manner, that the top of the head-dre&s;s de&s;cribed a large circle, and was frequently &s;triking the by-&s;tanders, which never failed to produce a laugh, at the expence of the per&s;on &s;o &s;truck.</P>
<P>Among the comic dances, was one in which the performers, who were all men, were di|vided
<PB N="67" REF="75">into two parties, di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by the colour of their dre&s;s. One was white and the other brown. The brown party repre&s;ented a ma&s;ter and his &s;ervants, and the white a parcel of robbers: the fir&s;t had a ba&s;ket of provi&s;ions given into their care by their ma&s;ter, and the dance of the white con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal expedients to &s;teal it. After a length of time the brown party &s;et their ba&s;ket down on the ground, in the mid&s;t of them, and lean|ing upon it, went to &s;leep; the others, taking advantage of this opportunity, lifted them up, and went off with it: &s;oon after this the &s;leepers awoke, mi&s;&s;ed their ba&s;ket, but without re|garding the lo&s;s, proceeded to dancing. The dramatic action of this dance would have &s;tood the te&s;t of critici&s;m, and per&s;ons of ta&s;te mu&s;t have admired the &s;implicity, unity, and cha&s;te|ne&s;s of the whole.</P>

<P>THE number of inhabitants &s;eems not to exceed &s;ix or &s;even hun|dred; and above two thirds of the&s;e are men. This di&s;proportion can no otherways be accounted for, but by the womens concealing them&s;elves. This might be the ca&s;e, or it might not, for very few children were &s;een, and the behaviour and conduct of tho&s;e women who made their appearance, gave it to be under&s;tood, that they could well di&s;pen&s;e with a plurality of hu&s;|bands. In colour, features, and language, the natives here bear &s;o great an affinity to tho&s;e of the more We&s;tern I&s;les, that they mu&s;t have had the &s;ame origin; but how the people &s;hould &s;pread them&s;elves throughout the whole South Sea, which is not le&s;s than one quarter of the globe, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing. The inhabitants of Ea&s;ter I&s;land are of a middle &s;tature, but &s;len|der, with thin features: their mu&s;cles are hard and rigid, influenced, as mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, by the heat and &s;terility of the country. They are lively, &s;trong, well made, and &s;wift of foot.
<PB N="72" REF="80">Their looks are mild, plea&s;ing, mode&s;t, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. Their complexion, in general, is a che&s;nut brown; but &s;ome few are darker, and &s;ome are quite white, and the bodies of the men are very hairy. Their beards are black and &s;trong, and they wear them clipped &s;hort. The no&s;es, both of men and women, are not very broad, but rather flat between the eyes; their lips, though not &s;o thick as tho&s;e of the negro, are &s;trong, and their hair is black and curling. Their eyes are dark brown, and ra|ther &s;mall, and the whites of them not &s;o clear as in other i&s;lands of the South Seas. The women wear their hair long, and &s;ometimes tie it up on the crown of the head, but the men never &s;uffer theirs to grow more than three inches in length. Both men and women are remarkable for the great length of their ears. They pierce the flaps of them, and &s;tretch the holes, by wearing a leaf in them, rolled up tight like a &s;croll, till they become two or three inches long and reach the &s;houlder. They &s;ometimes turn this &s;lit over the upper part of the ear, and it then looks as if the flap was cut off.</P>
<P>From the Dutch relation of Roggewein's voyage, we are taught to believe, that the &s;a|vages
<PB N="73" REF="81">of this i&s;land, were in 1722, twice as tall and as thick as the large&s;t European; that the men mea&s;ured in general twelve feet in height, and the women from ten to eleven. But this relation cannot be true, as Captain Cook met with none exceeding &s;ix feet high.</P>
<P>They <HI>tattow</HI> or puncture the &s;kin here, as they do at O-Taheitee, and mark them&s;elves from head to foot, face and all, in various fi|gures, nearly alike, but in different directions, as fancy leads. The women are not punctured &s;o much as the men; but they paint their whole faces with a reddi&s;h brown, over which they lay the bright orange of the turmeric root, or ornament them with &s;treaks of white.</P>

<P>THE &s;corching heat of the &s;un ob|liges them to cover their heads, which they do with a round fillet, decorated with fea|thers, and a &s;traw bonnet, &s;omething like a Scotch one. Others wear large bu&s;hy caps, of brown gull feathers, little le&s;s than the wig of an Engli&s;h judge.</P>

Both &s;exes wear on the brea&s;t, &s;u&s;pend|ed by the neck, a flat piece of bone, &s;haped like a laurel leaf; and occa&s;ionally necklaces and ear-rings, made of &s;hells, by way of amulet or charm.</P>

<P>THE con&s;truction of their huts declares the poverty and wretchedne&s;s of the people. They re&s;emble a canoe lying upon the ground, with the keel upwards, are about fifty or &s;ixty feet long, and are built in the following manner. The foun|dations are laid with &s;tone, by paving the ground in two curve lines, converging at the extremities to each other; the di&s;tance, from line to line, in the middle, is about &s;ix feet, and at the ends not more than a foot. In every &s;tone of this line or foundation is made a hole, into which they fix a &s;take, &s;ix feet high in the middle, and di|mini&s;hing proportionably to two feet at the ends: the&s;e &s;takes are drawn together, and fa&s;|tened at the top, and the whole is covered with matting of &s;ugar-cane leaves to the ground. On one
<PB N="75" REF="83">&s;ide is left an opening, eighteen or twenty inches high, by way of entrance, covered with a kind of porch: &s;o that to get in they are obliged to creep upon the hands and knees. In the&s;e huts they only &s;leep, and that on the bare ground. Some have &s;heds made with piles of &s;tone, and &s;ome &s;eem to live in caverns cut in the rocks; but as no admittance could be ob|tained into the&s;e, nothing can be &s;aid about them.</P>

<P>THEY do not appear to have any uten&s;ils, except gourds. Rogge|wein, in 1722, talked of their having earthen pots, but no &s;uch thing was &s;een in 1774. They dre&s;s their victuals in the O-Taheitean fa&s;hion, with hot &s;tones, in an oven, or hole in the ground; and roa&s;t their plantains under fires of &s;traw or dried gra&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Manufactures, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEY make a kind of cloth here of the bark of the paper mulberry, as they do at O-Taheitee; which they quilt with thread to &s;trengthen it, and paint yellow with turmeric. When com|pleted, it is &s;oft to the touch, like &s;ilk, and
<PB N="76" REF="84">they make ba&s;kets, bonnets, &amp;c. of matting, very neat.</P>
<P>Their working tools are very mean and few, made of &s;tone, bone, or &s;hells; but yet they are very ingenious at carving, and &s;hew a ta&s;te for the arts. They carve hu|man figures, about eighteen inches long, with great neatne&s;s and proportion, and poli&s;h them very highly.</P>
<P>In &s;everal places on the coa&s;ts of this i&s;land, are a number of gigantic &s;tone &s;tatues, &s;ome erected in groups, in platforms of ma&s;onry, and others &s;ingle, fixed only in the earth. They re&s;emble a human figure to the wai&s;t, are thirty feet high, more than eight feet acro&s;s the &s;houl|ders, and &s;eemed to be formed each of one &s;ingle &s;tone. The workman&s;hip is rude, and the eyes, no&s;e, and mouth &s;carce marked on an ill-&s;haped head; but the ears quite long, in the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion of the country. On the heads of the&s;e &s;tatues are placed huge round cylinders of &s;tone, five feet in height, and five in diameter, &s;et upright. They &s;eem to have been erected over the graves of &s;ome chiefs, in former days, not being the workman&s;hip of the pre&s;ent inha|bitants, but pre&s;erved now as monuments of antiquity. How the&s;e &s;tones were thus rai&s;ed
<PB N="77" REF="85">one upon another, is as little to be gue&s;&s;ed at as the manner in which tho&s;e at Stonehenge were erected. The i&s;landers do not pay any adoration to them, but hold them in a kind of veneration, and will not &s;uffer any one to tread upon the platforms. They proba|bly may have &s;ome tradition concerning them, but as the Europeans who vi&s;ited the i&s;land, did not continue long enough to learn the language, nothing could be collect|ed with any certainty; except only that they were the burial places of &s;ome former chiefs.</P>
<P>They call the &s;tatues by the following names, <HI>Ko-Tomoa&iuml;, Ko-Tomo&egrave;eree, Ko-H&ograve;o-oo, Morah&egrave;ena, Oomar&egrave;eva, Ween&acirc;boo, Weenap&egrave;.</HI></P>

In one of the&s;e canoes &s;een by Captain Cook was a board &s;ix or eight feet long, fourteen inches broad at one end, and eight at the other.

<HEAD>Religion and Government.</HEAD>
<P>VERY little can be &s;aid of the re|ligion of the&s;e &s;avages, except that they are not idolators and as little can be &s;aid of their go|vernment; whether or not they have one or more chiefs among them. When Roggewein was there, they appeared and &s;poke without di&s;tinction; the government was obviou&s;ly pa|triarchial; the mo&s;t aged had plumes of fea|thers on their heads, and a &s;taff in their hands; and it was ob&s;ervable, that in each hou&s;e or family, the olde&s;t per&s;ons governed and gave the orders. When Captain Cook was there, there &s;eemed to be but little &s;ubordination
<PB N="79" REF="87">among them. The plantations on the i&s;land are evidently private property, but, though he frequently &s;aw the&s;e plantations plundered, no penalty or puni&s;hment was the con&s;equence of the crime.</P>

<HEAD>Character, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the&s;e i&s;landers have weapons of of|fence, they are cowardly and timorous; they &s;tand in great awe of a mu&s;quet, and probably from the ravage that was made among them by Roggewein and his people, who, without any provocations, wantonly fired upon the na|tives and killed a great number of them: but they are harmle&s;s and friendly; have a natural mildne&s;s, fellow-feeling, and good-nature in their di&s;po&s;ition, which prompt them to treat their vi&s;itors kindly, and as ho&s;pitably as their wretched country will admit. They are frugal livers, and good &s;wimmers.</P>
<P>Their ideas of decency are of cour&s;e very different from tho&s;e of nations accu&s;tomed to cloathing. The women are neither re&s;erved nor cha&s;te, but would &s;it down with the Euro|pean &s;eamen, and undre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, would by &s;miles and la&s;civious ge&s;tures, entice them to familiarities; and both men and women, not|with&s;tanding their friendline&s;s, are exceedingly addicted to pilfering.</P>
<P>Whether it be owing to filthine&s;s or clean|line&s;s, I cannot take upon me to &s;ay; but, I

Like tho&s;e of the other South Sea I&s;les, they are addicted to pilfering, and the women almo&s;t as little re&s;erved, being extremely liberal of their favours to the Europeans that vi&s;ited them. They are in general a courteous friendly peo|ple; and though one or two fatally felt the re|&s;entment of the Engli&s;h, when they attempted

<HEAD>LA MAGDALENA</HEAD>
<P>LIES nearly in 10&deg; 25&prime; S. latitude, and 138&deg; 50&prime; W. longitude. It was only &s;een by Captain Cook in 1774, but was touched at by Mendana in 1595. It is from the account of his voyage, therefore, that the following particulars are collected.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is about &s;ix leagues in circuit, and lies ten leagues N. by W. from St. Pedro. It has high &s;teep cliffs to the &s;ea, is mountainous, with vallies, where the Indians dwell, and is very populous. When he drew near the &s;hore, above four hundred of the natives in &s;eventy ve&s;&s;els put off to the &s;hip: &s;ome &s;wam, and others were on floats. They &s;eemed to invite the Spaniards on &s;hore. They brought with them cocoa-nuts, and plantains. Above forty ventured on board, and notwith&s;tanding they were pre&s;ented with a variety of things, they could not help pilfering, and being unwilling to retire when the captain de&s;ired it, a great gun was fired in order to frighten them. On
<PB N="93" REF="101">hearing this they all jumped overboard, &s;wam to their canoes, and put them&s;elves upon their defence. A &s;hell was &s;ounded by way of a|larm, and a volley of &s;tones from &s;lings was im|mediately &s;ent into the &s;hip; and others threat|ened with their lances; but five or &s;ix being killed by mu&s;quet balls, they &s;oon held out boughs as &s;ignals of peace, and all again was quiet.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of La Magdalena are white, and of a gentle di&s;po&s;ition; large, &s;tout-limbed, and &s;o well &s;haped as greatly to exceed the Spaniards; they have beautiful teeth, eyes and mouths, delicate fine hands and feet, long fingers, flowing hair which they tie and plait, and among&s;t them &s;ome of the mo&s;t beau|tiful boys ever &s;een, all of them naked, and without the lea&s;t covering; and many of them were very ruddy: they are of European &s;tature, and they <HI>tattow</HI> or puncture their bo|dies and faces with the figures of fi&s;h and other forms.</P>
<P>Indeed, there is rea&s;on to believe that the na|tives of the Marque&s;as are all of one, and the &s;ame, tribe, and conver&s;e and trade together. What then has been &s;aid of St. Chri&s;tina will hold good with re&s;pect to the re&s;t.</P>

The hills are not higher than tho&s;e of the I&s;le of Wight, and in many places decorated with clumps of trees. Glades are frequently met with, covered with thick gra&s;s, and winding paths, beautiful by nature, leading to every part.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam, or, as it is called by the na|tives, <HI>Tongatabu,</HI> was al&s;o di&s;covered by, and received its name from, Captain Ta&s;man, in January 1642-3: it lies in 21&deg; 7&prime; S. latitude, and 175&deg; W. longitude, is to the northward of Middleburg, and about five leagues from it; it is &s;omething in the form of an I&s;oceles tri|angle, the longe&s;t &s;ides of which are &s;even leagues long, the &s;horte&s;t about four: its di|rection is nearly E.

<HEAD>Per&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>THE natives, both male and fe|male, are in &s;ize like Europeans; their complexion a uniform lighti&s;h copper, their hair in general black. They are well|&s;haped, and elegantly formed, have a regular &s;et of features, mild and plea&s;ing, fine eyes and good teeth; their faces are &s;omewhat different from the inhabitants of O-Taheitee,
<PB N="97" REF="105">being not &s;o round, their no&s;es not &s;o flat, and their lips not &s;o thick.</P>
<P>The hands and arms of the women are full as delicate as tho&s;e of the natives of O-Taheitee; but like them their feet and legs are large in proportion to the body. The men puncture their &s;kin here likewi&s;e, upon the thighs, breech, and hips, but the women do not; the only marks of this kind on them, are about the arms and fingers, and this very &s;paringly.</P>

<P>THE dre&s;s, both of men and women, con&s;i&s;ts of a piece of cloth, or mat|ting, tied round the wai&s;t, &s;o as to hang below the knees: the upper part of the body being ge|nerally naked. This &s;eems to be the dre&s;s of the women only, when Ta&s;man was there in 1643, for the men at that time went quite naked, except a &s;mall covering over their pri|vate parts. The men frequently wear a &s;tring round their necks by which a &s;hell of mother of pearl hangs down on the brea&s;t, and the women, loo&s;e necklaces made of &s;hell, fi&s;h-teeth, and &s;eeds intermixed.

<P><PB N="98" REF="106">Both &s;exes wear their hair &s;hort, and mo&s;t of them comb it upwards; the boys &s;eldom have more than a lock on the crown of their heads, and a little on each &s;ide, and the men &s;have their faces with &s;hells; a deviation from what was cu&s;tomary in 1643, when they wore whi&s;|kers, and let part of their beard grow, &s;o as to be about three or four fingers in breadth, and about a quarter of an inch in length.</P>
<P>They have a cu&s;tom here al&s;o of powdering their hair, with powder of different colours, &s;ome with white, made of a kind of lime, which burns the hair; others with blue, and others with orange colour, made of turmeric.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Habitations.</HEAD>
<P>HERE are no towns or vil|lages; the chief part of the hou&s;es are built in enclo&s;ed plantations, where convenience is more &s;tudied than order. They are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of O-Taheitee, except that the floor is a little rai&s;ed and covered with thick matting, of delicate texture, and beautiful co|lours. They are al&s;o inclo&s;ed on the windward &s;ide with matting, and have within a moveable &s;creen, made of wicker-work, to part off their bed-places. The roof is formed with a number of &s;pars and round &s;ticks, and covered with matting made of banana leaves. Their furni|ture
<PB N="99" REF="107">con&s;i&s;ts only of a few wooden platters, co|coa-nut &s;hells, &s;mall &s;quare cups, made of ba|nana leaves, curiou&s;ly folded, and &s;ome neat wooden &s;tools, on four legs, to re&s;t the head on at night, by way of pillow, when their clothing &s;erves them for a covering. A few pipkins and other earthen ve&s;&s;els were &s;een by Captain Cook in 1773, but he believed them to be the remains of what were pre&s;ented to the natives by Cap|tain Ta&s;man in 1643.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE language of the&s;e i&s;lands is nearly the &s;ame with that of O-Taheitee and the Society I&s;les, the difference not being greater than that between the north|ern and we&s;tern dialects of England; it is not, however, &s;o harmonious, being more replete with con&s;onants.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Animals.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR dome&s;tic animals are hogs only, and fowls. Hogs like tho&s;e of other i&s;les in this &s;ea, but the fowls were remarkably large and fine flavoured, equal if not &s;uperior to European poultry. They have no rats here, nor any quadrupeds, except lizards. Captain Cook left a dog and bitch there in 1773. The land birds are, pidgeons,
<PB N="100" REF="108">doves, parrots, parroquets, owls, blue bald|coots, large bats, that mea&s;ure from three to four feet between the extremities of the wings, when expanded, and a great variety of uncom|mon &s;mall birds.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Manufactures, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEY make the &s;ame kind of cloth here as they do at O-Taheitee, though not of &s;o many &s;orts, nor any near &s;o fine; but they have a way of &s;izing it, &s;o as to keep out the rain. They dye it of various tints, by dyes made from vegetables, black, brown, purple, yellow, and red. They make al&s;o matting of fine texture, which occa|&s;ionally &s;erves for cloathing, and &s;ome of &s;trong|er texture for flooring, and to &s;erve as &s;ails. Of their matting they make a variety of ba&s;|kets, and &s;ome al&s;o from the twi&s;ted fibres of the cocoa-nut, which they &s;tud with beads, formed from &s;hells and bones. They have the neate&s;t ornamental combs ever &s;een, con&s;i&s;ting of a number of little flat &s;ticks, about five inches long, firmly and elegantly connected to|gether by cocoa-nut fibres; and a variety of fi&s;hing-tackle. Their working tools are made of &s;tone, bone, &s;hell, &amp;c. as at the other i&s;lands; and when we &s;ee the work performed by them,
<PB N="101" REF="109">we hardly know which to admire mo&s;t the inge|nuity or the patience of the workman.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Arms.</HEAD>
<P>THE clubs of the&s;e i&s;landers wear a variety of forms, and are in ge|neral &s;o heavy, as not to be managed with one hand; and they are prettily carved and poli&s;hed. They have al&s;o &s;pears and &s;harp-pointed &s;ticks, &s;ome of which are barbed, and bows and ar|rows of a &s;ingular con&s;truction. The bow is &s;ix feet long, about the &s;ize of one's little finger, and when &s;lack forms a curve; the convex part has a groove in it that holds the &s;tring: in drawing the bow, in&s;tead of pulling it &s;o as to encrea&s;e the natural curvature, they draw it the rever&s;e way; &s;o that the &s;pring, to recover its former po&s;ition, gives greater velocity to the arrow, and the recoil never hurts the arm of the bow-man. It is probable that they are often at war with their neighbours, from the great quan|tity of arms in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Boats.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR canoes, in point of neat|ne&s;s and workman&s;hip, exceed every thing of the kind met with in the South Seas. They are con&s;tructed of &s;everal planks &s;ewed together &s;o neatly, that the joints on the out&s;ide
<PB N="102" REF="110">are &s;carcely to be &s;een. Some of their canoes are double, and &s;ome &s;ingle; the &s;ingle ones are from twenty to thirty feet long, about twenty inches wide in the middle, terminating at each end in a point. At the ends are a kind of deck, about ten feet long, &s;o that the canoe is open in the middle; and they frequently decorate their decks with rows of white &s;hells. Some of them have &s;ails, and &s;ome are worked on with paddles. The double canoes are formed of two, fa&s;tened together by &s;trong beams, and a boarded platform is rai&s;ed upon &s;taunchions over them. They are &s;o contrived, that they can be &s;unk under water quite to the platform, without being in any danger of filling; nor can they &s;ink while they hold together. They are in general &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet long, and four or five broad. They have one ma&s;t in the middle, and one &s;ail made of matting. Their rope is exactly like ours, and &s;ome of it four or five inches thick. On this platform is built a little &s;hed to &s;helter the crew from the weather, and they carry on it a moveable fire-hearth to dre&s;s their provi&s;ions, which is a wooden trough filled with &s;tones: the whole canoe, thus con&s;tructed, is as well fini&s;hed and well poli&s;hed, as our be&s;t cabinet-work in England.</P>

<P>IT is not &s;ufficiently known how the&s;e people amu&s;e them&s;elves at their lei&s;ure hours; all that can be &s;aid on this head is, that they frequently &s;ing in parts, and accompany the &s;ong with a &s;napping of their &s;ingers. Their voices are &s;weet and mellow, and they &s;ing in time and tune, much &s;uperior to the natives of the So|ciety I&s;les. They have a large bambo flute, with eight &s;tops, which they &s;ound like a Ger|man flute, but by the no&s;trils; and they have a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, formed of eight or ten reeds, of different lengths, joined together, re|&s;embling the ancient Doric pipe, which they &s;ound by the breath, &s;liding the in&s;trument to and fro along the lips. They have al&s;o a drum, formed of a piece of hollow wood, on the &s;ides of which they beat with &s;ticks, and produce a noi&s;e &s;omething like that which may be pro|duced from an empty ca&s;k.</P>
<P>They are great &s;wimmers and divers, and the women further amu&s;e them&s;elves at times by &s;ling|ing five or &s;ix balls continually into the air, and catching them alternately; and frequently they dance, and their dances are of the dramatic kind.</P>

<P>A leprous di&s;order &s;eems to be general here, and to acquire a great degree of virulence; but let their ulcers be ever &s;o bad, they appear to di&s;regard them. To cure this, or &s;ome other di&s;order, they bli&s;ter upon the cheek-bones, for the&s;e marks are &s;o univer&s;al, that mo&s;t of the i&s;landers mu&s;t have been &s;orely afflicted with di&s;ea&s;e, at one time or other.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Religion.</HEAD>
<P>VERY little is known of their religion: all that can be &s;aid of it is, that they do not &s;eem to be idolaters, nor like the people of O-Taheitee, to hold any par|ticular birds in veneration, but to wor&s;hip a &s;upreme invi&s;ible Being. The religious notions of a people are, indeed, the la&s;t things a &s;tranger becomes acquainted with, who is with them but a few days, owing to an imperfect knowledge of their language; be&s;ides, as I mentioned be|fore, the terms in which the natives of the South Seas expre&s;s their religious my&s;teries are dif|ferent from &s;uch as are in general u&s;e; of cour&s;e, it is difficult to get at them.</P>
<P>As their burying places, or places of wor&s;hip, are different from any thing yet mentioned, I
<PB N="105" REF="113">will de&s;cribe one. They are generally erected upon a green mount rai&s;ed by hand, &s;ixteen or eighteen feet above the level of the com|mon ground, which mount is of an oblong figure, and enclo&s;ed by a &s;tone wall about three feet high. From this wall the mount ri&s;es gradually, and is turfed; on the top of it &s;tands the hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, &s;imilar in figure to the mount on which it &s;tands, about twenty feet long and &s;ixteen broad, and has a gravel walk round it: in the front are two &s;tone &s;teps leading to the top of the wall: the hou&s;e is built like their dwelling-hou&s;es, only it is en|clo&s;ed with &s;trong matting; within, the floor is gravelled; the middle part, eight feet in length, is rai&s;ed about &s;ix inches above it, and paved with pebbles, and, this generally is the grave of &s;ome re&s;pectable per&s;on: a carved image or two &s;tuck up upon poles decorate the walls.</P>
<P>The&s;e buildings are called <HI>A-fia-touca,</HI> and they are generally &s;een where two roads cro&s;s each other. At particular times the prie&s;t ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the&s;e buildings in certain &s;et &s;peeches and prayers; but of what kind I cannot &s;ay.</P>

<HEAD>Government.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what could be col|lected from the natives, the government is much like that of O-Taheitee; that is, under certain chiefs &s;ubordinate to a &s;overeign.

<HEAD>Cu&s;toms.</HEAD>
<P>ONE hundred and thirty years do not &s;eem to have made any change in the cu&s;toms and manners of this peo|ple. What Captain Ta&s;man ob&s;erved in 1643, Captain Cook ob&s;erved in 1773. The mode of &s;aluting each other is by touching or meeting no&s;es; though &s;uch as wi&s;h to expre&s;s a greater regard, will embrace each other and ki&s;s the hands; and the &s;ign of peace to &s;trangers is the di&s;play of white flags; and a &s;till greater te&s;ti|mony of friend&s;hip is a reciprocal exchange of names. Whatever they are plea&s;ed to accept they immediately rai&s;e to their heads, and this grateful acceptance is taught them from their childhood. The intoxicating juice from the pepper-root of which they are very choice, they offer to &s;trangers as a mark of civility.
<PB N="107" REF="115">But the mo&s;t &s;ingular cu&s;tom among them, is the cutting off one or both of their little fin|gers, which they do on the death of a parent or near relation. Many of the i&s;landers carry about with them pidgeons perched on crooked &s;ticks: the&s;e po&s;&s;ibly may be marks or badges of honour; for at Horne I&s;land they are carried by per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in the pre&s;ence of a chief, in the &s;ame manner as falcons formerly were carried by the nobility in Europe.</P>

<HEAD>General character, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE general cha|racter of the natives is that they are friendly, brave, and courteous. The women are mo&s;tly mode&s;t and re&s;erved, particularly the married ones; but as in all countries there are &s;ome of ea&s;y virtue, &s;o are there in the&s;e i&s;lands, women who will invite your embraces by immode&s;t words and ge&s;tures. The women in general are the merrie&s;t creatures in life, they will, if we &s;eem plea&s;ed with it, chatter by one's &s;ide without any invitation, and without con&s;idering whether they are un|der&s;tood or not. But the&s;e as well as the men have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to pilfering. They are far more indu&s;trious here then at O-Taheitee, and this accounts for the regularity of their
<PB N="108" REF="116">plantations, and their nice divi&s;ion of proper|ty. Though their political con&s;titution does not appear favourable to liberty, and ea&s;ine&s;s of mind, yet they pre&s;erve a happine&s;s of tem|per. The climate is very good, between the extremes of heat and cold, and individuals are &s;eldom &s;een to be &s;ick or lame: they feel no wants which they are unable to gratify, and joy and contentment are painted in every face.</P>

It was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Captain Abel Ta&s;man in January 1642-3, and received its name from him; he met with a friendly welcome, and continued there about two days, and it was not vi&s;ited again by any European, till Captain Cook touched there in June 1774.</P>

With re&s;pect to their religion and government, nothing can be particularly &s;aid of it; but, as there is a coin|cidence of cu&s;toms and manners among the&s;e i&s;landers, and their neighbours, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that they imitate them al&s;o in their religious and con&s;titutional policy: though they have no burying places upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The natives &s;eem to be here more afflicted with the lepro&s;y than their neighbours. This

The roof is ridged at the top, &s;o that a &s;ection of the whole would re|&s;emble a pentagon. It is thatched, and the roof &s;preads a good way beyond the &s;loping walls. In one of the long &s;ides, there is an opening like a window, which is the only en|trance into it. Within, are &s;tored quantities of yams, which is probably the chief &s;upport of the natives.

<P>Captain Cook met with a very good recep|tion from the inhabitants; and was no &s;ooner landed than an old woman pre&s;ented a beautiful girl to him, and gave him to under&s;tand that &s;he was at his &s;ervice; indeed a num|ber of women put off to the &s;hip, and ten|dered them&s;elves to the &s;ailors for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The natives who are happy enough to call the rich plantations in this i&s;land their own, are ho&s;pitable and brave; but as they were in 1643 &s;o are they now&mdash;very much addicted to pilfering. The healthy climate, and ex|cellent productions, &s;eem to gratify them in all their wants: their general turn is to be active and indu&s;trious, but their behaviour to &s;trangers is rather polite than cordial.</P>

<P>LIES about eighteen or nineteen days &s;ail N. W. by W. of O-Taheitee, in 10&deg; S. latitude, and 185&deg; E. longitude from London. Its direction is N. and S. and it is about eigh|teen miles round. It was fir&s;t di&s;covered by De Quiros, who touched there in March 1606, and tells us, that notwith&s;tanding the na|tives of this i&s;land are expo&s;ed to the rigour of the &s;un, the air and cold, rea&s;on enough for burning up their &s;kins till they are as black as negroes, yet, they are extremely white and beautiful, particularly the women, and being graceful in their per&s;ons, and mode&s;t in their carriage, would, if cloathed in an European dre&s;s, eclip&s;e the ladies in his country. They are naked, covered only from the wai&s;t down|wards with neat well-made white mats com|po&s;ed of the palm, throwing over their &s;hould|ers occa&s;ionally a mantle of the &s;ame kind. Though a barbarous people, they &s;eem in ge|neral well di&s;po&s;ed: and De Quiros, however,
<PB N="113" REF="121">did not meet with a very friendly reception. Some of the &s;hip's people, in &s;earch of fre&s;h water, were oppo&s;ed by ten or twelve of the Indians, who attacked them with mi&s;&s;ile darts having &s;harp burnt points, and large black clubs; but the men with their &s;words and targets alone &s;oon overcame them. As a proof of their bra|very, however, it mu&s;t be told that a naked &s;avage, armed only with a club, fought more than twenty well-armed &s;oldiers, and &s;tood again&s;t them; and though fatigued, and over|powered with numbers, and &s;pent with the lo&s;s of blood, he dropped dead, biting the earth with revengeful agonies. Their &s;igns of peace are carrying burning torches in their hands, made with &s;ticks dipped in a kind of ro&s;in.</P>

<P>As De Quiros made but a very &s;hort &s;tay here, and it has not been vi&s;ited &s;ince by any European, no farther account of the i&s;land can be given, except what he collected from a na|tive of an i&s;le called Taumaco in the neigh|bourhood, whom he brought with him as far as Acapulco on his return. This i&s;land is
<PB N="114" REF="122">reckoned one thou&s;and two hundred and fifty leagues di&s;tant from Mexico, and is in 10&deg; S. latitude, and about 169&deg; E. longitude from London.

<HEAD>COCOS AND TRAITOR's ISLES</HEAD>
<P>ARE &s;ituated in 15&deg; 53&prime; S. latitude, and 175&deg; 13&prime; W. longitude from Greenwich, and were fir&s;t di&s;covered by Schouten in 1616, and afterwards vi&s;ited by Wallis in July 1767. They are about a league di&s;tant from each other.</P>
<P>Cocos or Bo&s;eawen's I&s;le, as it was called by Captain Wallis in honour of Admiral Bo&s;|cawen, is a high mountain, in appearance like a &s;ugar loaf; it is in 15&deg; 50&prime; S. latitude, and 175&deg; W. longitude: it is nearly circular and three miles over. It was called Cocos I&s;le by Schouten, from its being full of cocoa-nut trees.</P>
<P>When Schouten approached the land, a number of canoes put off from &s;hore with cocoa-nuts and yams, and when they were pret|ty near the &s;hip, the Indians jumped into the water with their provi&s;ions in their hands, for they are excellent &s;wimmers, and coming up the &s;hip's &s;ide, exchanged them for nails and &s;trings of beads. As the &s;hip's boat was going on &s;hore, the natives of Traitor's I&s;le, in canoes, &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="116" REF="124">it, and endeavoured to take it, being armed with &s;taves of hard wood, pointed and burnt at the end; on which the &s;ailors, in de|fence of them&s;elves, fired among&s;t them two or three times but without effect. This they laughed at, but on their leader's being killed at another fire, they di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>Traitor's I&s;le as it was called by Schouten from the reception he met with, or Keppel's I&s;le as it was afterwards named by Wallis in compliment to Admiral Keppel, lies in 15&deg; 55&prime; S. and longitude 174&deg; 33&prime; W. is three miles and a half long, and two miles broad, and is much le&s;s elevated from the &s;ea than Co|cos.</P>
<P>The natives of Traitor's I&s;le are a poor peo|ple, little better than &s;avages, without a chief or conductor. They were cloathed, when Schouten was there, all round with ru&s;hes, having &s;trings about their necks to which hung the &s;hell of a &s;nail or mother of pearl. When Wallis was at Traitor's I&s;le in 1767, the in|habitants were clothed in matting, and were without the fir&s;t joint of their little fingers. Tho&s;e of Cocos are a hand&s;ome robu&s;t well|made people, of large &s;tature. Some wear their hair &s;hort, &s;ome curled, &s;ome long, and
<PB N="117" REF="125">others tied in tre&s;&s;es of various kinds. The flaps of their ears are &s;lit and hang down almo&s;t as low as their &s;houlders: they wear whi&s;kers, and a little beard under the chin, the re&s;t being all &s;haven, and their bodies are marked or <HI>tat|towed</HI> in like manner as the i&s;landers of O|Taheitee.</P>
<P>In 1616, a chief put off from the &s;hore, in a canoe covered with a mat in form of a tent, and accompanied with a number of peo|ple in thirty-five canoes: as they approached Schouten's &s;hip the chief cried out three times with a loud voice; and at the fourth, all his company joined in the cry. He pre&s;ented the captain with a paper dre&s;s, and a fine mat; and he was entertained and received pre&s;ents in his turn. The&s;e people, certainly, had no idea of property, attempting to &s;teal every thing they could lay their hands upon; nay, they tried to draw out the nails from the &s;hip's &s;ide with their teeth, and &s;ome &s;wam under the keel, and attempted to draw the nails from thence; but being fired at, they de&s;i&s;ted. The next day, however, they put off from &s;hore to the number of one thou&s;and, with hogs, ba|nanas, fowls, and cocoa-nuts, of which they have plenty, under a pretence of trading; and
<PB N="118" REF="126">the chief or <HI>Latou,</HI> as he is there called, in a double canoe, giving a &s;ignal, they all &s;hout|ed, and at that in&s;tant threw a volley of &s;tones on board the &s;hip, and the chief was ab&s;urd enough to &s;uppo&s;e that he could run down the &s;hip by &s;ailing again&s;t it with his canoe: he made the ridiculous attempt, and beat the head of his canoe to pieces; this exa&s;perated the Indians, and they reanimated their attack; but, on a di&s;charge of &s;ome mu&s;quets, and a few great guns, they were &s;oon put to flight; and with very little &s;laughter.</P>
<P>The canoes of the&s;e i&s;landers are made of one piece of red wood, flat before, and pointed behind; they dart along very fa&s;t in them, &s;teering them and putting them on with two oars a-&s;tern. They have other canoes that carry a &s;ail, in the middle of which is generally drawn a grey and red cock; and a large piece of wood on the larboard &s;ide, with which they keep the ve&s;&s;el upright: on this wood is a fi&s;h|gig, a kind of prong to &s;trike fi&s;h, always ready for u&s;e.</P>
<P>It is worthy of a remark on the i&s;lands in the&s;e &s;eas, that though no kind of metal was found in them, yet the inhabitants in general, as &s;oon as they got a piece of iron, began to &s;harpen

<HEAD>HORNE, OR HOORN,</HEAD>
<P>LIES in 14&deg; 56&prime; S. latitude, and 179&deg; E. longitude from Greenwich, and was di&s;covered al&s;o in 1616 by Captain William Schouten, who &s;ailed from Holland. It is computed to lie 1660 leagues W. of Peru. When Schou|ten's &s;hip was near the land, the natives put off from the &s;hore in canoes as did the people at Cocos and Traitor's I&s;le, and when on board attempted to &s;teal every thing in their way; on being oppo&s;ed they became unruly; but a &s;hot or two &s;oon quieted the&s;e as it did the others. After this they brought branches of trees, and white flags, as &s;ymbols of peace, and invited the &s;hip's company on &s;hore; which, when ho&s;tages were exchanged on both &s;ides, was complied with.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tages &s;ent from on &s;hore were ap|parently men of di&s;tinction, and accompa|nied to the ve&s;&s;el by two young men their &s;ons, as hand&s;ome, genteel, and well made as one would wi&s;h to &s;ee, with fine open coun|tenances,
<PB N="120" REF="128">good hair, and good eyes. The pur&s;er who went as ho&s;tage from the &s;hip, was received by the chief of the i&s;land, whom they called the <HI>Herico,</HI> with great ceremony and humility, bowing him&s;elf and laying pro&s;trate before him for near half an hour. A man of di&s;tinction near the chief, threw him|&s;elf down al&s;o, weeping like a child, and with the greate&s;t abai&s;ance took the pur&s;er's foot, and laid it upon his own neck. When more of the &s;hip's company went on &s;hore, the chief, and his &s;on the viceroy, took off their crowns and put them on the &s;ailors heads: the&s;e crowns were made of long white feathers tipped with others red and green, tho&s;e of the paroquet. The Indians of di&s;tinction round the chief, carried each a pigeon perched on a little &s;tick. The&s;e pigeons are white above to the wings, the re&s;t black, except on the belly where the feathers are reddi&s;h. They have a fi&s;h here re&s;embling a bat, on account of the largene&s;s of the head and body, &s;mallne&s;s of the tail, and great extent of a pair of fins which re|&s;emble wings: the &s;kin of this fi&s;h is &s;potted like a &s;parrow-hawk.</P>
<P>The men of this i&s;land are tall, large, well made, and &s;trong bodied: they are fa&s;t run|ners,
<PB N="121" REF="129">expert &s;wimmers, and good divers. Their complexion is a yellow brown, and they take great plea&s;ure in dre&s;&s;ing their hair, which is black. Some tie it, others frize it, and others curl it; &s;ome let it grow down to the wai&s;t, and tie it in five or &s;ix tails, and others dre&s;s it right an end, &s;tanding up like hog's bri&s;tles, ten or eleven inches long; but they do not &s;uffer the beard to grow.</P>
<P>The women are very much deformed both in face and body, and are &s;hort. Their brea&s;ts are long, and hang down to their bel|lies like leather bags; of cour&s;e they are very ugly, and at the &s;ame time, they are very im|mode&s;t, performing the rites of Venus in the pre&s;ence of every one, only under a mat. Both men and women go naked, except a piece of covering between their legs; and the women rub their heads and cheeks with &s;omething red.</P>
<P>Their land produces &s;pontaneou&s;ly a great variety of fruits, &s;uch as cocoas, bananas, yams, &amp;c. for they know nothing of cultiva|tion, and at low water the women catch fi&s;h, which is eaten raw. They have al&s;o &s;ome hogs which they cook wretchedly.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="130">They &s;eem to have very little notion of mer|chandize; and no great appearance of reli|gion; though when the chief came on board the &s;hip, he fell on his face, and &s;aid &s;ome|thing like a prayer: but there is a kind of &s;ubordination to &s;uperiors among them; for one of them having &s;tolen a &s;word from on board the &s;hip, on a complaint to the chief, the &s;word was returned, and the man that &s;tole it ba&s;tinadoed, and given to under&s;tand by his king, that if he did &s;o again he &s;hould lo&s;e his head.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es or huts of the natives are erected along the &s;hore as thick as they can &s;tand. They are built with leaves of trees, in form of a hay-cock, about twenty-five feet round, and ten or twelve feet high, with a door &s;o low that they are obliged to &s;toop to get in. They have no furniture within, except a fi&s;h|gig or &s;taff; and in &s;ome a wooden club, which &s;eems to be all the weapon they have; and a little dry gra&s;s like hay to &s;leep on.</P>
<P>The canoes of this i&s;land are made with much &s;kill, and have an outrigger; neither the head nor the &s;tern is rai&s;ed, but there is a kind of deck over each of them, and in the middle of the&s;e is a row of wooden pegs,
<PB N="123" REF="131">with heads like nails, covered with fine white &s;hells. The &s;ail is triangular, compo&s;ed of &s;e|veral matts; two of its &s;ides are bent to two &s;ticks, one of which &s;upports it up along the mat, the other an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of a boom.</P>
<P>The natives are upon the whole a lively peo|ple, and &s;eemed to enjoy dancing with the &s;ail|ors; and &s;ome of Captain Schouten's people found a number of young girls dancing be|fore the chief by moonlight, quite naked, to the &s;ound of an in&s;trument made in form of a pump. I mu&s;t not forget to mention that they have a wonderful way of climbing a rock or tree expeditiou&s;ly, by winding a band round the feet.</P>
<P>While the Europeans were there, the chief of a neighbouring i&s;le came to vi&s;it the chief of Horne, and Captain Schouten was pre&s;ent at the meeting, which he thus de&s;cribes: When the two chiefs approached each other, they threw them&s;elves pro&s;trate on the ground, as in an act of adoration, and clapped their hands; they then ro&s;e up and &s;eated them&s;elves on the ground, under a &s;hed, upon two mats; then a number of the natives, more than three hundred, who brought with them round their wai&s;ts a quantity of a green plant called by
<PB N="124" REF="132">them <HI>Kava,</HI> chewed it and &s;pit it out into a great trough; when they had thus prepared a &s;ufficient quantity of this ma&s;ticated herb, they poured water on it, and mixed it, and &s;queezed it together, &s;training it with tow, and gave it to their chiefs to drink: they next &s;erved up plenty of roa&s;ted yams, and &s;ixteen hogs quite bloody, out of which they had only taken the guts without wa&s;hing them, and put a few hot &s;tones in the bellies to roa&s;t them within; this, with burning the bri&s;tles a little, is what they call cooking: the di&s;hes were carried on the heads of the attendants, who kneeled down, and thus placed them before the chief: nine hundred people were a&s;&s;embled on this occa|&s;ion, and when the chiefs had dined, they fell to upon the remainder.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to animals; as De Quiros's peo|ple were only once on &s;hore, and Captain Cook merely &s;ailed round the i&s;land, it cannot be &s;aid with any certainty that they abound with cattle.

<P>The natives are taller, &s;touter, and better &s;haped than tho&s;e of Mallicolo, to which I mu&s;t refer the reader, and of the &s;ame colour with the Mallicole&s;e. Their hair like theirs al&s;o is black, &s;hort, and frizzled: &s;ome were ob&s;erved to have it long, tied up on the crown of the head, and ornamented with feathers. They go naked, except two long &s;lips of mat|ting five inches broad, hanging down before and behind from the wai&s;t to the knees, and fa&s;tened round the middle by a girdle. Some

<P>They &s;eem to &s;peak a language &s;imilar to that at Anamocka, for they under&s;tood many of the terms of that i&s;land; and their hou&s;es are thatched and low.</P>
<P>Their canoes have triangular &s;ails, but are very indifferently made like tho&s;e of Mallicolo, and they have outriggers.</P>
<P>When De Quiros touched there, &s;ome of his people went on &s;hore and endeavoured to make peace with the Indians; but one among them, apparently a chief, making a line on the ground with a bow, gave a &s;ign that they &s;hould not pa&s;s it, but this not being complied with, the barbarians let fly a volley of arrows, which was returned by a volley of balls that killed &s;ome, particularly the chief, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t.

<P>UPON this i&s;land there are many ponds of &s;tag|nant water, where the natives plant great quan|tities of eddoes.

Se|veral &s;orts of blo&s;&s;oms embelli&s;h the tufted fo|liage, and the mo&s;t beautiful bind-weeds wind like ivy to the tops of the talle&s;t trees, and adorn them with wreathes of blue and purple flowers. There is a hot &s;pring in this i&s;land, coming out of a rock clo&s;e to the edge of the &s;ea, who&s;e degree of heat is &s;uch, that the finger cannot be held in it longer than a &s;ingle &s;e|cond. A thermometer that &s;tood at 78&deg; on board the &s;hip, plunged in this &s;pring, ro&s;e to 191&deg; in the &s;pace of five minutes; and in an|other place to 202 &frac12;&deg;.

<PB N="154" REF="162">They are &s;oon provoked, and when &s;o, are governed by no other law than force, and en|deavour to extirpate their enemies with an un|common degree of rage. Their arms are clubs, &s;pears, or darts, bows and arrows, and &s;tones. The clubs are of three or four &s;orts, from three to five feet long; with the&s;e they parry or ward off the darts of their enemies, much in the &s;ame manner as they do at O-Taheitee. Some of their clubs have a lateral blade, like a far|rier's fleam; &s;ome have great knobs upon them; &s;ome have two &s;harp edges, and others are cy|lindrical, and they are all highly poli&s;hed and kept oiled.

They fix the eye on the fore|finger of the right hand, and the other is hitch|ed round the dart ju&s;t above the hand; then taking the dart between the thumb and fore|finger, they ca&s;t it from the &s;tring, to the di&s;|tance of ten or twelve yards, with &s;uch force and accuracy, that they will hit a mark four inches in diameter, and force it through a board two inches thick. They &s;hoot their ar|rows

<HEAD>EGMONT's ISLE, OR NEW GUERNSEY,</HEAD>
<P>AS it was called by Captain Carteret, or Santa Cruz, as it was before named by Men|dana, who fir&s;t di&s;covered it in 1595, lies in 11&deg; S. latitude, and 164&deg; E. longitude, ninety leagues N. N. W. of E&s;pirito Santo, about
<PB N="161" REF="169">nine hundred E. of Manilla, and one thou&s;and eight-hundred and fifty W. of Lima; and is from ninety to about a hundred leagues in cir|cuit, having many harbours: it is quite cover|ed with woods to the tops of the highe&s;t hills, of which there are many, no place being free from trees, but where the Indians have cleared them away for their plantations. There is a fine open bay, in the north &s;ide of the we&s;tern part of this i&s;land, four leagues and a half in circuit, its mouth half a league, formed by an i&s;le to the we&s;tward, four leagues in circum|ference: this i&s;le was called by Mendana, <HI>La Guerta, i. e.</HI> The Garden, from its beauty and fertility: it was called by Captain Carteret, Trevanion's I&s;le, and was ob&s;erved by him to be exceedingly populous.</P>
<P>When Mendana came near the &s;hore, in 1595, he met with a very unwelcome reception; for the natives put off from the land, and let fly a volley of arrows at the &s;hip, which fortunately did no mi&s;chief: the &s;oldiers on board were ac|cordingly ordered to fire; one Indian was kil|led, many wounded, and they all fled. The next morning, however, a chief, with a train of the natives, ventured on board, exchanged names with the Captain, as a mark of friend&s;hip, and
<PB N="162" REF="170">was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his reception and en|tertainment, that he and his people came to and fro for four days. One day, however, the &s;ame chief, attended with fifty canoes, the men in which having concealed their arms, came along the &s;hip's &s;ide; but a &s;oldier taking up a mu&s;quet, &s;o di&s;|plea&s;ed him, that he in&s;tantly returned to his party, who rowed a&s;hore, and founded an alarm; and on the boat's crew going on &s;hore the next day for water, they were attacked by the In|dians, and war was commenced: forty &s;oldiers, by order of the Captain, landed upon the i&s;land on purpo&s;e to cha&s;ti&s;e them: a party of the Indians flew before them, and took &s;helter in &s;ome hou&s;es, which the &s;oldiers burnt about their ears. Six i&s;landers lo&s;t their lives in this affair; and &s;even of the &s;oldiers were wounded with arrows.</P>
<P>A party of the &s;hip's company, going a&s;hore in another part of the i&s;land, was attacked by five hundred natives, ca&s;ting vollies of arrows, darts, and &s;tones; they fought very loo&s;ely, jumping about, while they perceived no mi&s;|chief from the fire arms; but when they &s;aw two or three killed, and more wounded, they fled. Mendana's de&s;ign was to &s;ettle a colony here, having carried out a number of married people for that purpo&s;e; but his project was
<PB N="163" REF="171">entirely defeated; for, notwith&s;tanding he &s;tay|ed here two months and eight days, they could neither conquer nor bring about a reconciliation with the Indians: the &s;oldiers having malevo|lently killed the chief that fir&s;t came off to them, and notwith&s;tanding the murderers, by the Captain's orders, were beheaded to &s;atisfy the Indians, nothing would effect it; and to add to the misfortune, &s;ickne&s;s took place among the &s;hip's company, and carried off Mendana, &s;everal of his officers, and many of his people.</P>
<P>Captain Carteret's attempt to be upon good terms with the i&s;landers, in 1767, was equally fruitle&s;s; for on the ma&s;ter and &s;ome of the men's going a&s;hore, a &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued between them and the Indians, who followed them brea&s;t high into the water, as they were putting off in the boat; and in this attack, the ma&s;ter and three &s;eamen lo&s;t their lives. The Indians here are well di&s;ciplined, and &s;hoot their arrows in regular platoons. His attempt to land on Trevanion's I&s;le was to as little purpo&s;e; for as &s;oon as the natives &s;aw the boat leave the &s;hip, they &s;ent off &s;everal armed canoes to at|tack her; they returned, however, &s;ecure from a flight of arrows &s;ent after them, having killed
<PB N="164" REF="172">one Indian, and mortally wounded another, by a volley of their &s;mall arms. On &s;ome of the great guns being fired from the &s;hip, with grape &s;hot, they thought proper to retire, leaving the wounded Indian in a canoe by him&s;elf be|hind. This Indian was brought on board, and found to be &s;hot through the head, and to have one of his arms broken; but as the &s;urgeon deem|ed him pa&s;t recovery, he was put into his canoe again, and notwith&s;tanding his condition, he paddled away to &s;hore. From this unwelcome reception, which both the Spaniards and the Engli&s;h met with, no very particular account of this i&s;land and its inhabitants can be given. All that can be &s;aid is as follows.</P>

Their hou&s;es are &s;urrounded by a wall of loo&s;e &s;tones, open at the entrance, in&s;tead of a gate; and the &s;ides and floors within are lined with fine matting. There is in each town a large hou&s;e, probably a temple, and another long hou&s;e, apparently belonging to the community, in which are hung bundles of arrows, in great quantity, ready for u&s;e; and al&s;o a well or two curiou&s;ly made, with &s;teps to go down, and covered with plank. Some of their towns are &s;urrounded with a brea&s;t-work of &s;tone, re|&s;embling a fortification, and gives rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the natives are often troubled with civil wars; and clo&s;e to the &s;ea are &s;ome fi&s;hing weirs fenced with &s;tone.

<P>IS the di&s;covery of Captain Cook, in Sep|tember 1774, and, excepting New Zealand, is perhaps the large&s;t i&s;land in the South Pacific Ocean, extending from the latitude of 19&deg; 37&prime; to 22&deg; 30&prime; S. and from the longitude of 163&deg; 37&prime; to 167&deg; 14&prime; E. Its direction is nearly N.W. half W. and S.E. half E. and it is about eighty|&s;even leagues long. Its breadth does not any where exceed ten leagues; Captain Cook coa&s;t|ed the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, but the &s;outh &s;ide is as yet unexplored. It lies about twelve degrees, or two hundred and forty leagues di&s;tant from New Holland.</P>

<HEAD>Face of the Country, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a country full of hills and vallies, of various extent, both for height and depth. From the&s;e hills &s;pring great numbers of little rivulets, which fertilize the plains, and &s;upply the wants of the inhabitants. The tops of mo&s;t of the hills &s;eem to be barren, though
<PB N="172" REF="180">&s;ome few are covered with trees, as are all the plains and vallies. From the hills, the flat lands which lie along the &s;hore appear to great advantage; the winding &s;treams that meander through them, the plantations, the little &s;trag|gling villages, and the plea&s;ing variety of wood, &s;o chequer the &s;cene, as to render it delightful: notwith&s;tanding this, the thin &s;tratum of poor vegetable &s;oil that covers the plains, the num|berle&s;s &s;wamps on the &s;ea &s;ide, and the dry parched earth every where, ill repay the hu&s;band|man's toils. The natives are indefatigable in their cultivation, or the land would not &s;atisfy their wants. They drain the mora&s;&s;es, and manure their plantations with broken &s;hells and corals. The mountains, and other high &s;pots, are, for the mo&s;t part, incapable of being culti|vated, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of rocks, many of which are full of mundicks. The little &s;oil up|on them is &s;corched with the &s;un and affords little but a few &s;cattered trees, and a quantity of dry gra&s;&s;es, two or three feet high, and this, to a people who have no cattle, is of very little u&s;e. The general way of recruiting land in the South Seas is, by letting it lie u&s;ele&s;s for &s;e|veral years, and burning the weeds and gra&s;s upon it annually.</P>

<HEAD>Product.</HEAD>
<P>THE productions of this i&s;land are figs, &s;ugar-canes, plantains, taro, or eddy root, by &s;ome called yams, cocoa-nut and bread-fruit (the la&s;t two &s;carce), and many Ea&s;t Indian plants. The taro plantations are watered by artificial &s;treams, continually &s;upplied by the main channel at the foot of the mountains. They have two ways of planting this root; &s;ome in &s;quare or oblong patches, &s;unk below the level of the ground, by which means they can let as much water in upon them as is nece&s;&s;ary; others in ridges, three or four feet broad, and two and a half high. On the top of the&s;e ridges is a narrow gutter, through which is conveyed a rill of water that moi&s;tens the whole ridge. Among their trees, are the mangrove, and the caputi-tree, which la&s;t is large and black at the root, having long narrow leaves like willows, of a pale dead green colour, bearing flowers, and a bark perfectly white, &s;oft, and loo&s;e, which often conceals within it beetles, ants, &s;piders, lizards, and &s;corpions, and frequently bur&s;ts off from the wood. In the Ea&s;t Indies they caulk their &s;hips with the bark of this tree, and the natives of the Moluccas make the oil of caputi from the leaves, which are extremely fragrant
<PB N="174" REF="182">and aromatic. Here is al&s;o a new &s;pecies of the pa&s;&s;ion-flower, which is the more extraordi|nary, as no kind of this flower has been &s;up|po&s;ed to grow wild in any part of the world, except America.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Animals.</HEAD>
<P>THEY have no quadrupeds in this i&s;land of any kind, but a va|riety of the feathered tribe, large tame fowls, with bright plumage, ducks, a &s;ort of &s;mall crow tinged with blue, a beautiful &s;pecies of parrot, turtle-doves, fly-catchers, a kind of hawk, boobies, man of war, tropic birds, and others unknown to Europe. Turtles and fi&s;h in plenty, particularly a poi&s;onous fi&s;h, &s;ome|thing like a &s;un-fi&s;h, with a large long ugly head, and which brings on an extraordinary numbne&s;s and giddine&s;s in tho&s;e who eat it. They have al&s;o, as mentioned before, beetles, ants, &s;piders, lizards, &s;corpions, &amp;c. and a flat|tailed water-&s;nake. Captain Cook left with them an O-Taheitean dog and bitch.</P>

<HEAD>Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE having been le&s;s bountiful to New Caledonia than to other tropical i&s;lands in the South Seas, the inhabitants are not very numerous. Captain
<PB N="175" REF="183">Cook computes the number to be about fifty thou&s;and, which, on a &s;ea coa&s;t, of near two hun|dred leagues, is but &s;mall. They are of a dark brown colour, like that of mahogany, and nearly the &s;ame with the people of Tanna, but they have better features, more agreeable counte|nances, and are a much &s;touter race, &s;ome few mea&s;uring &s;ix feet four inches in height. Some indeed have thick lips, flat no&s;es, and full cheeks; and, as they be&s;mear their faces with black pigment, they look like negroes. All are in general well proportioned, but many of the men have &s;welled and ulcerated legs and arms, apparently occa&s;ioned by lepro&s;y, and al&s;o a &s;welling of the &s;crotum.</P>
<P>The &s;tature of the women is middle-&s;ized, &s;ome are tall, and their whole form is very &s;tout, and rather clum&s;y. Their features are coar&s;e, but expre&s;s good-nature: the fore|head high, and the no&s;e broad and flat at the root, and eyes &s;mall, the cheek-bones prominent, and the cheeks plump. Their hair, like that of the men, is black, &s;trong, and frizzled, and in many woolly; both men and women keep it cut &s;hort, &s;o that their heads re&s;emble tho&s;e of negroes; and as it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed frequently to want &s;cratching, they have an excellent in|&s;trument
<PB N="176" REF="184">for this purpo&s;e; a kind of comb, made of &s;ticks of hard wood, from &s;even to ten inches long, and about the thickne&s;s of knitting needles; about twenty of the&s;e are fa&s;tened to|gether at one end, parallel to each other, and about the tenth of an inch a&s;under. The&s;e combs they wear con&s;tantly in their hair, on one &s;ide of their heads. They cut their hair with a piece of mineral, &s;harped like a flint. Some few indeed of the men wear it long, and tye it up on the crown of the head; others &s;uffer only a large lock to grow on each &s;ide, which they tie up in clubs.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE men go quite naked, except a wrapper over their privities, which they fa&s;ten up to their girdle, as they do at Mallicolo, or up to the neck by a &s;tring, and ornament that &s;tring with &s;mall round beads, of a pale green nephritic &s;tone. This wrapper is made of &s;oft bark or leaves, and though it is contrived to conceal what all nations wi&s;h to hide, it has altogether a very indecent appear|ance, and every male looks like a walking fi|gure of the Roman garden-god. They wear on their heads black cylindrical caps, made of &s;tiff coar&s;e matting, open at top, very much
<PB N="177" REF="185">like a hu&s;&s;ar's cap. The chiefs ornament theirs with feathers. They &s;tretch the flaps of their ears to a great length, cut out the whole carti|lage or gri&s;tle, as at Ea&s;ter I&s;land, and hang great numbers of tortoi&s;e-&s;hell rings in them, as they do at Tanna.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the women gives them a thick &s;quat &s;hape, and con&s;i&s;ts of a petticoat re&s;embling fringe, about eight inches long, ju&s;t dropping below the wai&s;t: it is made of filaments, or &s;mall cords, laid thick over one another, and fa&s;tened to a long &s;tring that is wound &s;everal times round the body. The outward filaments of this fringe they dye black; the under ones are of a pale yellow. By way of ornament, they fix on one &s;ide of the petticoat a few pearl oy&s;ter-&s;hells. Both &s;exes wear tortoi&s;e-&s;hell ear|rings, necklaces, and bracelets, above the el|bow. The women <HI>tattow</HI> or puncture them|&s;elves a little in the face, generally in three black &s;trait lines, from the under lip downwards to the chin; and they carry their infants on their backs in a kind of &s;atchel.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Habitations.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of their hou&s;es are circular, &s;omething like a bee|hive, and full as clo&s;e and warm, very much
<PB N="178" REF="186">like tho&s;e at Cocos and Horne I&s;land: the en|trance is by a &s;quare hole, ju&s;t large enough to admit a man upon his hands and knees. The &s;ide walls are about four feet and a half high; but the roof is lofty and peaked at the top, above which is a &s;tick, generally ornamented with carving and &s;hells. The frame of this build|ing con&s;i&s;ts of a number of poles fixed into the ground, drawn together and tied at the top, and connected to each other by twigs, in the manner of hurdles. This is covered with mat|ting, from top to bottom, and the roof thatched with &s;traw. Within, a kind of large table is made upon po&s;ts for convenience: the floor is &s;pread with dry gra&s;s to &s;leep on, and here and there mats for the principal people. Some of the&s;e hou&s;es have two floors, one above the other; but they have no light but what comes through the entrance. In mo&s;t are two fire|places, and commonly a fire burning; and, as there is no vent for the &s;moke but by the door, the whole hut is continually &s;moaky and hot.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Uten&s;ils.</HEAD>
<P>THEY have no great variety of hou&s;hold uten&s;ils. Each family has an earthen pot that will hold four or five
<PB N="179" REF="187">gallons, clum&s;ily &s;haped, with a large belly, and made of a reddi&s;h clay, but perfectly cover|ed, both within and without, with &s;oot. In the&s;e they bake and cook their victuals, on hearths in the open air, rai&s;ing the pot from the fire or embers by three pointed &s;tones, fixed into the ground, and ri&s;ing five or &s;ix inches from it, by way of trivet. The pot, when on the fire, is not &s;et upon its bottom, but laid in|clined on one &s;ide.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Food.</HEAD>
<P>THEY &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on roots and fi&s;h, and the bark of a tree, which they roa&s;t, and are for ever chewing, and which has a &s;weeti&s;h, in&s;ipid ta&s;te. This tree grows in the We&s;t Indies. In barren &s;ea&s;ons they have recour&s;e to fern-roots: and, as to drink, water is their only liquor. Their fi&s;h they catch with nets made of the filaments of the plantain-tree twi&s;ted, and with fi&s;h-gigs, with which they lie in wait upon the reefs, in &s;hoal water, and &s;trike the fi&s;h as they may chance to come in their way.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Tools.</HEAD>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to mention their work|ing tools, they being made of the &s;ame materials, and much in the &s;ame manner,
<PB N="180" REF="188">as at the other i&s;lands. The in&s;trument with which they &s;tir up the &s;oil is indeed different, it being a long, curved and &s;harp-pointed bill, like the bill of a bird fixed upon a handle. They u&s;e this al&s;o occa&s;ionally as a weapon of defence. Their axes, likewi&s;e, are &s;omewhat different, being made of a crooked piece of wood, forming a great knob, with a &s;hort handle, not exceeding &s;ix inches in length: the knob is hollowed out, and a black cutting &s;tone is wedged into the cavity. They carry loads on their back, upon boards &s;lung round the &s;houlders.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Arms.</HEAD>
<P>THE people of New Caledonia are well provided with weapons of of|fence, of cour&s;e they mu&s;t &s;ometimes have wars among them&s;elves, or with their neighbours. The&s;e weapons are, clubs, &s;pears, darts, and &s;lings for ca&s;ting &s;tones. Their clubs are about two feet and a half long, and of different forms; &s;ome like a &s;cythe; others like a mattock; &s;ome have a head like a hawk, and others have knobs at the end; but they are all neatly made and well poli&s;hed. Their darts and &s;pears are ornamented with carved work; but their &s;lings are perfectly &s;imple, being no other than a
<PB N="181" REF="189">&s;lender, round cord, no thicker than packthread, with a ta&s;&s;el at one end, a loop at the other and in the middle. The &s;tones they throw are of a &s;oft &s;oap-rock, rubbed into the form of an egg. The&s;e exactly fit the loop in the middle of the &s;ling, and are kept in a pocket of matting, tied round the wai&s;t for the purpo&s;e. They ca&s;t their darts al&s;o with a &s;hort &s;tring knotted at one end, and looped at the other, as they do at Tanna, called by &s;eamen a Becket, and are very dextrous in throwing them. Their &s;pears are fifteen or twenty feet long, blackened over, and have a prominence near the middle, carved &s;o as to re&s;emble &s;omething like a human face.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Canoes.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR canoes are, in &s;ome &s;ort, like tho&s;e of the Friendly I&s;les; but heavy and clum&s;y. They are, as it were, double, con&s;i&s;ting of two hulls, made out of two large trees, hollowed out, the gunnel rai&s;ed about two inches high, and clo&s;ed at each end with a kind of bulk head of the &s;ame height. The two hulls are &s;ecured to each other, about three feet a&s;under, by &s;everal cro&s;s &s;pars, which project about a foot over each &s;ide: on the&s;e &s;pars is laid a deck or heavy platform, on which
<PB N="182" REF="190">they have a fire-hearth, and generally a fire burning; and they carry a pot to dre&s;s their victuals in. The &s;pace between the two hulls is laid with plank. They are navigated with one or two latteen &s;ails, compo&s;ed of matting; the ropes are made of the filaments of the plan|tain-tree, twi&s;ted into cords of the thickne&s;s of a finger, and three or four more &s;uch cords marled together, &s;erve them for &s;hrouds. When they cannot &s;ail they row them on by paddles, or &s;culls, and for this purpo&s;e there are holes in the boarded deck, through which they put the &s;culls, which are &s;o long, that, when the blade is in the water, the handle is four or five feet above the deck. The per&s;on who works it &s;tands behind it, and with both his hands &s;culls the ve&s;&s;el forward. The canoe is about thirty feet in length, the deck or platform about twen|ty-four, and ten in breadth.</P>

<HEAD>Religion and Government.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN Cook having been at New Caledonia but eight days, little can be &s;aid of their religion. Nothing was ob&s;erved that could be con&s;trued into a religious act; nor was a &s;ingle cu&s;tom remarked that had the lea&s;t colour of &s;uper&s;tition. When a per&s;on dies, they com|mit
<PB N="183" REF="191">his body to the earth and bury it. Their graves are enclo&s;ed with &s;ticks about three feet high, the earth is rai&s;ed a little over them, and generally decorated with &s;pears, darts, paddles, &amp;c. &s;tuck right up in the ground about them.</P>
<P>As little can be &s;aid of their government. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the country is divided into many di&s;tricts, and that each di&s;trict has a chief. Perhaps each family forms a little kingdom of its own, which is directed by its patriarch, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in all infant &s;tates. The wo|men here are kept in the highe&s;t &s;ubordination, not &s;o much e&s;teemed by the men as tho&s;e at Tanna, and &s;eem to be the only per&s;ons who are employed in any laborious bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Language.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR language, if we ex|cept the word <HI>Areekee, i. e.</HI> Chief, and one or two more, has no affinity with any of the various languages of the South Sea i&s;lands. It &s;eems to be uncultivated, and their pronunciation is indi&s;tinct. Though they have but few har&s;h con&s;onants, they have a frequent return of gutturals, and a na&s;al &s;ound unknown but to the Engli&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>Character, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THESE people are &s;trict|ly hone&s;t, and not the lea&s;t addicted to pilfering: they are good &s;wimmers, and fond of &s;inging and dancing. The only mu&s;ical in&s;trument ob&s;erved among them was a whi&s;tle, made of a poli&s;hed piece of brown wood, about two inches long, &s;haped like a bell, though apparently &s;olid, with a rope fixed at the &s;mall end. Two holes were made in it near the ba&s;e, and another near the in&s;ertion of the rope, all which had &s;ome communication with each other, and, by blowing in the upper|mo&s;t, a &s;hrill &s;ound like whi&s;tling was formed at the other. The inhabitants in general may be deemed a friendly, inoffen&s;ive people: they gave Captain Cook and his &s;hip-mates a very welcome and peaceable reception, addre&s;&s;ing him fir&s;t in a &s;hort &s;et &s;peech, and then inviting him a&s;hore; but they are indolent and de&s;titute of curio&s;ity: the greater part of them did not move from their &s;eats when the Europeans pa&s;&s;ed them for the fir&s;t time: they are remark|ably grave, &s;peak always in a &s;erious tone, and laughter &s;eems to be a &s;tranger among them; perhaps their plantations lying remote from each other, are the means of preventing that
<PB N="185" REF="193">familiar intercour&s;e, which would gradually give life to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety. The wo|men are kept, as I &s;aid before, in the greate&s;t &s;ubjection: they &s;eem fearful of offending the men by a look or a ge&s;ture. Their in&s;en&s;ible hu&s;bands &s;eldom deign to look upon them, and continue in a kind of phlegmatic indolence; whil&s;t the women &s;ometimes indulge that &s;ocial chearfulne&s;s, which is the di&s;tingui&s;hing orna|ment of the &s;ex. Con&s;idering the&s;e cruel op|pre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ex, &s;een in a variety of coun|tries, may we not admire the wi&s;dom of the Creator, who has planted that attachment in the female brea&s;t, which &s;tands the te&s;t of every outrage, and patiently ties them to their ty|rants? To the honour likewi&s;e of the women of New Caledonia, as well as tho&s;e of Tanna, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that they are far more cha&s;te than tho&s;e of the more Ea&s;tern I&s;les: they would frequently divert them&s;elves with the European &s;eamen, &s;eemingly li&s;ten to their propo&s;als, beckon them a&s;ide among the bu&s;hes, and, with an air of coquetry, laugh at them for their pains. There was not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of their ever having conde&s;cended to permit any indecent fa|miliarity from an European, during their whole &s;tay.</P>

<P>CONSISTS of two large i&s;lands, divided by a &s;treight four or five leagues broad, and lying nearly north and &s;outh of each other, be|tween 180&deg; 45&prime; and 193&deg; 15&prime; W. longitude, and 34&deg; 24&prime; and 47&deg; 24&prime; S. latitude, and about two thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from O-Taheitee. The northern i&s;land is called by the natives <HI>Ea|hei-nomauwe,</HI> and that to the &s;outh <HI>T'avai Poe|nammeo.</HI> The figure and extent of the&s;e i&s;lands will appear in the chart. They are much the &s;ize of each other, and together are as large as the i&s;land of Great Britain; having many &s;mall i&s;lands about them. They were fir&s;t di&s;covered by Abel Jan&s;en Ta&s;man, a Dutchman, on the thirteenth of December 1642. He coa&s;ted the Ea&s;tern part, from latitude 34&deg; to 43&deg;, and en|tered the &s;treight which divides the two i&s;lands; but, meeting with a di&s;agreeable reception from the natives, as &s;oon as he dropped his anchor, he thought proper to weigh it again without landing. He called the country Staaten Land,
<PB N="187" REF="195">in compliment to the States General; but it is now known by the name of New Zealand. He &s;uppo&s;ed the land to be a continent; but Captain Cook, in 1769 and 1770, traver&s;ed the whole coa&s;t and di&s;covered it to be two i&s;lands, having a number of fine bays and anchoring places.</P>
<P>Captain Cook was &s;ix months coa&s;ting New Zealand, having made the land October 5, 1769, and not leaving it till March 31, 1770. He paid it a &s;econd vi&s;it in October 1773, and a third in October 1774, and it was touched at by M. De Marion, a Frenchman, in 1772.</P>

<HEAD>Face of the Country.</HEAD>
<P><HI>T'AVAI POENAM|MOO</HI> is, in general, a barren country, and a ridge of mountains, tower|ing in many places above the clouds, extends near|ly the whole length of the i&s;land; the tops of which being for ever covered with &s;now, more rude or de&s;olate pro&s;pect from the &s;ea cannot be con|ceived; for as far inland as the eye can reach, nothing but the &s;ummits of rocks appear, which &s;tand &s;o clo&s;e together, that in&s;tead of vallies being between them, there are nothing but fi&s;&s;ures. Further to the north the mountains are more inland, and the &s;ea coa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of
<PB N="188" REF="196">woody hills and vallies, and large plains co|vered with trees.</P>
<P><HI>Eahei-nomauwe</HI> is much more fertile: it is mountainous, indeed, but the mountains are clothed with trees, and every valley is watered with a rivulet. The &s;oil in the vales is light and &s;andy, and the productions of Europe would flouri&s;h here with luxuriance. A va&s;t quantity of pummice &s;tone lies all along the &s;hore, which indicates that there is a volcano in this i&s;land; and that there is iron, is evident from the quan|tities of iron &s;and brought down to the &s;ea coa&s;t by every rivulet. There is a mountain here as high as the Peak of Teneriffe, who&s;e &s;um|mit &s;oars far above the clouds: but what is more remarkable, there are many arched rocks in different places truly grand and romantic, one foot of who&s;e arches &s;tands upon the i&s;land, the other in the &s;ea, and who&s;e arches are large enough to admit a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el beneath them. One of the&s;e arched rocks, &s;tanding inland, has a river running under it.</P>

<HEAD>Climate.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pring begins here with the month of November; the winters are milder than tho&s;e in England; and the &s;um|mer, though more equally warm, is not hot|ter:
<PB N="189" REF="197">&s;o that was this country &s;ettled by Euro|peans, they might &s;oon be richly furni&s;hed, not only with the nece&s;&s;aries, but the luxuries of life.</P>

<HEAD>Productions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>T'AVAI POENAMMOO</HI> is but thinly inhabited, and chiefly by wanderers from one part to another, but <HI>Eahei-nomauwe</HI> is, in many places, highly cul|tivated, and they &s;ave their offal for manure. In their plantations the ground is as well tilled, and the mould as &s;mooth as in our gardens, and every root has its &s;mall hillock ranged by lines in a regular quincunx, and every thing planted with the nice&s;t care and attention: for where the per&s;on that &s;ows is to eat the produce, and where there is little el&s;e to eat, it is natural to expect they &s;hould excell in tillage. Their plantations are of different extent, from one acre to ten: here they grow &s;weet potatoes, co|coas, gourds, and yams. They have excellent celery, and a kind of cre&s;&s;es, with abundance of farinaceous fern-root, which &s;erves them for bread. Gourds are cultivated for the fruit, which furni&s;hes them with ve&s;&s;els for various purpo&s;es. They have a &s;ort of long pepper, very much the ta&s;te of mace; and near four

<P>But, among the vegetable productions of the&s;e i&s;lands, the trees claim no &s;mall con&s;idera|tion.

They are rather too hard and heavy for ma&s;ts; but if they could be lightened by tapping, as it is probable they might, they would make the fine&s;t ma&s;ts for &s;hipping in the world: they are not unlike the pitch-pine. There are &s;ome with a &s;carlet flower, well adapt|ed to the mill-wright. There are many other &s;orts of trees; one like the maple, yielding a whiti&s;h gum, and another giving a deep yellow &s;ub&s;tance fit for dyeing. They have plenty of mangrove trees, and a kind of tree that grows &s;o large and lofty, that they will mea&s;ure, at &s;ixteen inches above the ground, full nineteen feet in girth, and ninety feet, &s;trait as an ar|row, from the root to the fir&s;t branches; many of them will yield three hundred and fifty-&s;ix feet of &s;olid timber, exclu&s;ive of the branches. It bears a narrow leaf like the juniper, is ge|nerally found in low land, and has a dark-co|loured appearance. The natives make their canoes of this tree. There is al&s;o a cabbage
<PB N="191" REF="199">tree here, the &s;tem not thicker than a man's leg, but from ten to twenty feet high. They are of the &s;ame genus with the cocoa-nut tree: the cabbage is the bud, each tree producing but one, and that at the crown, where the leaves &s;pring out, and are enclo&s;ed in the &s;tem: cutting off the cabbage de&s;troys the tree. This vegetable is not only whole&s;ome, but exceeding|ly palatable. Great quantities of &s;upple-jack are found in the woods, and of exceeding great length.</P>
<P>But among all the trees and &s;hrubs, of which there are many, bearing beautiful flowers, and highly aromatic, there is not one that produces fruit; but there is a plant worth them all, &s;erving the natives in&s;tead of hemp and flax. Of this plant there are two &s;pecies; one bearing a deep red flower, the other a yellow. The leaves of both re&s;emble flags, but the blo&s;&s;oms are not &s;o large, and their clu&s;ters are more in number. They make all their clothes of the leaves of this plant, and al&s;o all their &s;trings and cordage, which are at once glo&s;&s;y, ela&s;tic, and &s;o &s;trong, that nothing made of hemp can equal them. From the &s;ame, by another pro|ce&s;s, they draw out long, &s;lender, &s;trong fibres, white as &s;now, and &s;hining as &s;ilk; of the&s;e they
<PB N="192" REF="200">make their better cloth; and, by &s;litting the leaves in proper breaths, and tying them toge|ther, they make their fi&s;hing-nets. This plant &s;eems to grow be&s;t in boggy grounds; there is every rea&s;on to believe that it would thrive well in England, and could we tran&s;port it here, it would be a great acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, when there, ordered &s;ome land to be dug up, in which he &s;owed a variety of European &s;eeds; and, on his return, they ear following, he found almo&s;t all the radi&s;hes and turneps &s;hot into &s;eed, the cabbages and carrots very fine, and abundance of onions and par&s;ley in good order: a proof that the winter was mild; but the peas and beans were almo&s;t lo&s;t, &s;eemingly de&s;troyed by the rats, and no potatoes could be found, probably extirpated by the natives.</P>

<HEAD>Animals.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are no four footed ani|mals in this country, but dogs and rats; the latter are &s;carce, but there are plenty of the former; they are tame, and live with the inha|bitants, who breed them merely for food. Their dogs are of a &s;ulky di&s;po&s;ition, are &s;mall and ugly, with rough long hair, pricked ears, much like the &s;hepherd's cur; their colours are different; &s;ome
<PB N="193" REF="201">are &s;potted, &s;ome black, and others white. They feed as their ma&s;ters do, on fi&s;h and vegetables. Three or four of Captain Cook's people &s;aw a quadruped, when they where out upon the hunt; but as no two of them gave the &s;ame de&s;cription of it, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what it was; probably as no other of the &s;ame kind was &s;een either before or after, they might have mi&s;taken &s;omething el&s;e for it. However, they all agreed, that it was about the &s;ize of a cat, with &s;hort legs and a mou&s;e colour. One &s;aid it had a bu&s;hy tail, and was mo&s;t like a jackall of any animal he knew. Captain Cook left them &s;ome hogs and gee&s;e.</P>
<P>Though quadrupeds are &s;carce, there are birds in endle&s;s variety, exqui&s;itely beautiful, and &s;uch as are unknown to Europeans; hawks, owls, quails, &s;omething like our parrots, wood|pidgeons, and numberle&s;s &s;mall &s;inging birds, infinitely &s;uperior in wild melody, to any yet heard; and, what is mo&s;t remarkable, the birds, like our nightingales, begin to &s;ing at mid|night, and continue their &s;ong till &s;un-ri&s;e, and are &s;ilent all the day. Their parrots are of two &s;orts, one &s;mall and green, the other very large, of a greyi&s;h green, with a reddi&s;h brea&s;t. Among the &s;mall birds, they have three very &s;ingular ones, one with two wattles under its beak, as
<PB N="194" REF="202">large as tho&s;e of a &s;mall dung-hill cock: it is larger than an Engli&s;h blackbird, with a &s;hort and thick bill; its feathers are of a dark lead colour, and its wattles of a dull yellow or orange. The &s;econd is of a fine mazarine blue, except its neck, which is a beautiful &s;ilver grey, and a few white feathers on the pinion joint of the wing. Under its throat hang two little tufts of curled &s;now-white feathers. It has a &s;weet note, and its fle&s;h is delicious. The third may be called a fan-tail, of which there are &s;everal &s;orts; but the mo&s;t remarkable has a body &s;carcely bigger than a large filbert, yet it &s;preads a tail of beautiful feathers, three quar|ters of a &s;emicircle of near five inches deep.</P>
<P>Of the aquatic order, they have ducks, wa|ter-hens, &s;hags, curlieus, gee&s;e and gannets, re|&s;embling ours, and a variety of &s;ea-birds, alba|tro&s;&s;es, &s;heerwaters, pintados, penguins, &amp;c. and a &s;pecies between bird and fi&s;h, who&s;e fea|thers differ little from &s;cales, and who&s;e wings &s;erve only for diving.</P>
<P>Of ducks there are five different kinds, the large&s;t are the &s;ize of Mu&s;covy ducks, beauti|fully feathered and darkly variegated, with a large white &s;pot on each wing. The &s;econd &s;ort are about the &s;ize of an Engli&s;h duck; its
<PB N="195" REF="203">feathers are brown, tipped with a yellowi&s;h white, with bright green feathers in its wings, and bright yellow eyes. The third &s;ort is a blui&s;h-grey whi&s;tling duck, about the &s;ize of a widgeon, with a cartilaginous or gri&s;tly bill; for they live upon worms, which they &s;uck out of the mud. The fourth &s;ort is &s;omething larger than a teal, and all black, except the drake, which has &s;ome white feathers in his wings. The la&s;t &s;ort is rather le&s;s than a teal; its colours are a &s;hining greeni&s;h black above, a dark &s;ooty grey below, a purple ca&s;t on the head, a lead coloured bill and feet, a white bar in the le&s;&s;er quill feathers, and a golden eye.</P>
<P>A few butterflies, beetles, and fle&s;h-flies, like ours, with &s;ome mu&s;quitos and &s;and-flies, make up their whole li&s;t of in&s;ects; and with the la&s;t two they abound. The &s;ting of the &s;and-fly is ex|ceedingly painful; and, when the part &s;tung grows warm, cau&s;es an intolerable itching, which, if &s;cratched, brings on a violent &s;wel|ling, attended with great pain, and &s;ome fever.</P>
<P>Of fi&s;h they have no &s;carcity; every creek &s;warms with them; mackerel, of many kinds, bream, mullet, &s;kate, &s;ting-ray, flounders, eels, congers, lob&s;ters, cray-fi&s;h, clams, cockles, mu&s;cles, and fine oy&s;ters, and they have &s;ome
<PB N="196" REF="204">whales, and plenty of &s;eals. They catch their fi&s;h with cylindrical nets, which they bait and lower down into the water, drawing them up gently, and, when at the &s;urface, taking them out with a jerk.</P>

<P>THE number of inhabitants bears no proportion to the ex|tent of country. <HI>Tavai Poenammoo</HI> is, as I &s;aid before, very thinly peopled, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of wanderers, but <HI>Eahie-nomauwe</HI> is bet|ter populated; though the we&s;tern &s;ide of this i&s;land is quite a de&s;ert, and the interior parts being &s;o mountainous, &s;carce any place is in|habited but the &s;ea coa&s;ts, which, on an extent of four hundred leagues, is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain only about one hundred thou&s;and people.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Per&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tature of the men, in ge|neral, is equal to the large&s;t Euro|pean, tall, but lean, yet exceedingly &s;trong, fle&s;hy and well made, and they are exceedingly active and vigorous, with an uncommon adroit|ne&s;s in every thing they do; but mo&s;t of their legs are &s;lender and bandy, with large knees, owing to the little exerci&s;e they take, and their continually &s;itting cro&s;s-legged in confined ca|noes.
<PB N="197" REF="205">Their complexion is a clear mahogany brown, though they are rather darker in the &s;outhern i&s;land. Their hair is black and curl|ing, and their teeth extremely regular and white. They have good faces, like Europeans, dark eyes, lips rather thick, and aquiline no&s;es. Their voice is rough, they talk loud, and, in general, are more rude and unpoli&s;hed than the natives of O-Taheitee.</P>
<P>The women are plain, and have no great fe|male delicacy; but their voices are remarkably &s;oft and harmonious, and by this they are chief|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed, the dre&s;s of both &s;exes being nearly the &s;ame. They have, like the women of other countries, a cheerfulne&s;s &s;uperior to the men, and a greater flow of animal &s;pirits. Some of them have uncommon long brea&s;ts. They &s;eem to be proud of their &s;ex, and expect to have every thing they wi&s;h from &s;trangers, merely becau&s;e they are women.</P>
<P>They <HI>tattow</HI> them&s;elves here as they do at O|Taheitee, and call it <HI>amoco:</HI> different tribes have different ways of marking them&s;elves: &s;ome cover them&s;elves &s;o much on the breech and thighs with &s;piral lines, that they &s;eem as if they had on black &s;triped breeches; and, as they add &s;omething every new year to the ornaments of
<PB N="198" REF="206">the la&s;t, tho&s;e who are advanced in life are al|mo&s;t covered from head to foot. They have &s;carcely a &s;tain, except on the lips, which all &s;eem to concur in rendering black. Many in|dent their &s;kins, &s;o as to re&s;emble carving, which they do by cutting it with &s;hells. The women are <HI>tattowed</HI> only on the brea&s;ts, necks, and bel|lies, but then they be&s;mear their faces and bo|dies with red oker and oil, which &s;eldom dries, and thus render them&s;elves filthy and na&s;ty; for whoever touches them partakes of their colour|ing. Servants among the men do the &s;ame, but the&s;e u&s;e chiefly dry oker, and &s;ome carry it with them, and as con&s;tantly renew the colour as it rubs or wears off.</P>

<HEAD>Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE general dre&s;s of the men of this country, is merely a wrapper round the body, kept from falling below the wai&s;t by two &s;lips over the &s;houlders, fa&s;tened before and behind with bone bodkins. It is made of flag-leaves, and re&s;embles a &s;haggy door-mat. Some men, on particular occa&s;ions, wear another piece of this matting round the wai&s;t, which reaches almo&s;t to the ground. They tie the prepuce of the penis with a &s;tring over the glands, and fa&s;ten this &s;tring to a girdle
<PB N="199" REF="207">round the body. The glands, indeed, &s;eem to be the only part they wi&s;h to conceal; for they will often throw off every thing, without &s;cruple, but this &s;tring and girdle; which, whenever they were reque&s;ted to untie, they did with re|luctance and confu&s;ion. Some wear &s;houlder|knots made of the &s;kin of the neck of a large &s;ea-fowl, with the feathers on, &s;lit into two pieces lengthways; and &s;ome wear a piece of &s;haggy matting round their &s;houlders, by way of cloak, which has all the appearance of a &s;traw thatch. The dre&s;s of the chiefs, and principal people, con&s;i&s;ts of a cloth jacket, ornamented with &s;tripes of dog-&s;kin, in different parts, or tufts of red feathers, and cloaks trimmed with dogs-fur, of different colours, and often lined with the &s;ame. This cloak is a &s;quare piece, two corners of which are tied on the brea&s;t, the other part hangs down to the calf of the leg, and a belt of matted gra&s;s confines it round the wai&s;t.</P>
<P>The women wear a petticoat and cloak of the &s;ame rough matting, perfume them with &s;ome fragrant plant, and beneath the petticoat before wear a bunch of aromatic leaves, hanging from a girdle between the legs. They wear their hair cropped &s;hort, or flowing about their &s;houlders, ornamenting it with leaves; but the men tie
<PB N="200" REF="208">theirs up in a bunch on the crown of the head, decorate that bunch with feathers, and &s;tick a comb behind it. Their beards they wear cut &s;hort. Both men and women grea&s;e their hair, and frequently wear, upon the crown of their heads, a large bunch of black feathers, tied up round, &s;o as to rai&s;e their head twice its natural height, and almo&s;t to cover it.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes wear a variety of ornaments, ear|rings, necklaces, and anclets. Both men and women bore their ears, and &s;tretch the holes till they will admit a finger; in the&s;e they wear cloth, feathers, bones of large birds, and &s;ome|times pieces of wood &s;tuck through them. The women frequently &s;tuff in the white down of the albatro&s;s, &s;tained with ruddle or oker, which &s;preads before and behind, as large as one's fi&s;t; and, though &s;ingular, has a very good effect. Sometimes they hang to their ears, by &s;trings, chizels, or bodkins, made of talc, and often the nails or teeth of their decea&s;ed relations; bracelets and anclets are made of birds bones, &s;hells, or any other &s;ub&s;tance they can drill a hole through. The men &s;ometimes wear round the neck, &s;u&s;|pended by a &s;tring, a piece of green tran&s;parent tale, or whalebone &s;haped like a laurel leaf, and with the rude figure of a man carved upon it;
<PB N="201" REF="209">and &s;ometimes through the &s;eptum or gri&s;tle that divides the no&s;trils, a long feather, project|ing on each &s;ide over the cheeks; and &s;ome wear a fillet of feathers round their heads.</P>

<HEAD>Food.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief food on which this peo|ple live, is fi&s;h and vegetables. Dogs fle&s;h is very &s;carce. The birds they eat are ge|nerally penguins, albatro&s;&s;es, and a few others, which &s;erve them as delicates. They roa&s;t their birds by hanging them to a &s;mall &s;tick, inclined to the fire, one end of which is &s;tuck into the ground, and bake them by putting them into a hole in the ground, with hot &s;tones, as they do at O-Taheitee. They frequently dry their fi&s;h in order to pre&s;erve them, and &s;moke their eels. As a &s;ub&s;titute for bread, they eat fern-roots, very &s;imilar to ours, which they thus prepare: after &s;corching them over the fire, they beat them with a &s;tick, till the bark and dry out&s;ide fall off; what remains, is a &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, ra|ther clammy and &s;weet, mixed with &s;tringy fi|brous parts, which, after having chewed, they &s;pit out. They are great eaters, will take in pieces &s;ix times as large as we can do, and will drink near a quart at one draught.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="210">Water is their only liquor; and, having no|thing that will intoxicate, they are, in this re|&s;pect, the happie&s;t per&s;ons in the world; but, on the other hand, &s;hould their plantations fail, or an unfavourable &s;ea&s;on happen, and they ac|cidently not be provided with a &s;ufficient dry &s;tock, the di&s;tre&s;s to &s;uch as inhabit the interior parts of the country mu&s;t be dreadful. This will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, account for the fear the&s;e people live in of each other, for the care they take to fortify their villages, and for the hor|rid cu&s;tom of eating tho&s;e whom they kill in battle. The head is the only part they do not eat. They &s;uck the brains, and frequently con|vert the &s;kull to dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, &s;uch as to hold water, &amp;c. The way they di&s;patch their pri&s;oners, is, by knocking them down with their patta-pattoos, and then ripping them up.</P>

<HEAD>Habitations.</HEAD>
<P>THE towns, or <HI>hippahs,</HI> of the&s;e people, are all fortified. Many are built upon eminences near the &s;ea, and &s;ecured on the land &s;ide by a bank and ditch, and a high paling within the ditch; and &s;ome have out-works. Their hou&s;es are built on a ri&s;ing ground, under a tuft of trees, but are little better than dog-kennels, &s;eldom more
<PB N="203" REF="211">than eighteen or twenty feet long, eight or ten broad, and five or &s;ix high, and con&s;i&s;t only of a roof: the pole that runs from one end to the other forms the ridge to the ground. The framing con&s;i&s;ts of &s;lender &s;ticks, tightly put together, and is covered with dry gra&s;s. There is a door at one end, ju&s;t high enough to admit a per&s;on on his hands and knees; near the door is a &s;quare hole, for the double purpo&s;e of giv|ing light and letting out the &s;moke. The roof projects beyond the end walls, about two feet, &s;o as to form a porch, in which there are benches for the family to &s;it on. That part of the floor where the fire-place is (which is generally at the end, in the middle between the two &s;ides), is inclo&s;ed in a hollow &s;quare, by partitions either of wood or &s;tone, and in the mid&s;t the fire is made. The floor within, along the &s;ides, is bedded thick with &s;traw, and on this the family, in bad weather, &s;leep; at other times, they &s;leep abroad in the open air, having no other &s;helter but a few &s;hrubs: the women and children are ranged innermo&s;t; the men lie in a half circle round them, and they &s;et up their arms again&s;t the trees clo&s;e by them.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Amu&s;ements, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR chief amu&s;e|ments are, &s;inging and dancing. Whil&s;t one &s;ings, in a rough man|ner, others will dance and make their ge&s;tures conform to the roughne&s;s or uncouthne&s;s of the &s;ong: they will roll their eyes, loll out their tongues, alternately extend their arms, work them&s;elves up into a kind of frenzy, and, join|ing with the la&s;t chorus of the &s;ong, &s;tamp their feet in a violent and frantic manner. Grey|headed old men will often take part in their dances, and a&s;&s;ume every antic po&s;ture imaginable. Wo|men, when they dance, tie on before them an apron made of their clo&s;e-wrought cloth, orna|mented with red feathers, dog-&s;kin, and ear|&s;hells; but they throw off, as do the men, their &s;haggy cloaks. They &s;ing &s;ometimes, parti|cularly the women, with a degree of ta&s;te un|common among &s;avages; their voices are mel|low and &s;oft, and have a plea&s;ing and tender ef|fect.
<PB N="205" REF="213">Their &s;ongs are frequently in parts; &s;ung by many voices, and in proportionate thirds. Their tunes are generally dirge-like, &s;low and &s;olemn, re&s;embling the chaunt which a popi&s;h prie&s;t u&s;es at ma&s;s, containing many tones and &s;emi-tones, and they accompany their &s;ongs, which &s;eem to have great &s;implicity, and to be a kind of metre without rhyme, with &s;ome corre&s;ponding expre&s;&s;ions of countenance. Their mu&s;ic is far &s;uperior to that of the Society and Friendly I&s;les; and if any nation of the South Sea comes in competition with them, it is only that of Tanna.</P>
<P>They have three &s;ounding in&s;truments, but they can &s;carcely be called mu&s;ical ones. One is a trumpet, made of a &s;hell, which gives a noi&s;e not unlike that which our boys make with a cow's horn. This &s;hell is generally mounted with wood, prettily carved and pierced at the point where the mouth is applied. The &s;econd is a &s;traight wooden tube, about four feet long, five inches in diameter through its whole length, except at the mouth, where it is reduced to two; with this in&s;trument they always &s;ound the &s;ame note, and it makes a very uncouth kind of braying. The third is a &s;mall wooden pipe, re&s;embling a child's nine-pin, but much &s;maller, and yields a noi&s;e &s;omething like a pea-whi&s;tle.
<PB N="206" REF="214">They are &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e in&s;truments are not mu&s;ical, for they never attempt to &s;ing to them, or to produce with them any tones that bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a tune.</P>

<HEAD>Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>TWO or three &s;orts of cloth are made in the&s;e i&s;lands: the &s;haggy &s;ort, mentioned before, re&s;embling a thrummed door-mat, one as coar&s;e as our coar&s;e&s;t canvas, though ten times as &s;trong, and another as glo&s;&s;y as &s;ilk. The &s;haggy &s;ort is made of flag-leaves, &s;plit into three or four &s;lips, and interwoven when dry, leaving a number of ends hanging to it on the out&s;ide, eight or nine inches long; and the glo&s;&s;y &s;ort is formed by many threads lying very clo&s;e one way, and a few cro&s;&s;ing them the other; but the&s;e are about half an inch a&s;under, &s;omewhat like the round pieces of cane matting that are by &s;ome per&s;ons placed under the di&s;hes upon table to &s;ave the cloth. This &s;tuff is prepared &s;o as to &s;hine like &s;ilk, and is often &s;triped. It is made in a frame of the &s;ize of the cloth, about five feet long and four broad, acro&s;s which the long
<PB N="207" REF="215">threads that lie clo&s;e together, or warp, are &s;trained, and the cro&s;s threads, or woof, are worked in by hand. To this la&s;t kind of cloth, they work borders of different colours, and va|rious patterns, in &s;titches like an girl's &s;ampler, and with a degree of neatne&s;s and elegance, which, con&s;idering they have no &s;uch thing as a needle, is &s;urprizing; this is always the work of the women, though it is chiefly worn by the men. They have the cloth-plant here, as well at O-Taheitee, and they make cloth of it, but, being &s;carce, no larger pieces are made than &s;ufficient to hang in their ears, by way of orna|ment.</P>
<P>They have a particular and &s;ingular ta&s;te for carving: they attempt not to imitate any thing in nature, but confine them&s;elves to a volute or &s;piral, which they vary many ways, &s;ingle, double and triple, and with as much regularity as if done from mathematical draughts. They thus ornament their boats, paddles, arms, tools, and almo&s;t every thing they make; though they have very awkward tools to do it with.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;hing nets mu&s;t not be here forgot|ten. The&s;e they make of a kind of gra&s;s, very &s;trong in it's nature, and their principal nets are &s;o large, that they &s;eem to be the joint work
<PB N="208" REF="216">and joint property of a whole town: they are generally about five fathom deep, and from three to four hundred fathom long: they make al&s;o a circular net, extended by two or three hoops, &s;even or eight feet in diameter, which they bait at the bottom, and leave open at the top. In u&s;ing it, it is let down &s;o as to lie on the ground; and, when a &s;ufficient quantity of fi&s;h is &s;uppo&s;ed to be collected over it, they draw it up by a gentle and even motion, &s;o that the fi&s;h are &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of being lifted up in it, till they bring it very near the &s;urface of the water; and then take it out by a &s;udden jerk. They very &s;eldom angle for fi&s;h, but, when they do, their fi&s;h-hooks are made of bone.</P>
<P>Nothing el&s;e, worth mentioning on this head, was &s;een among them, but ba&s;kets of various kinds and dimen&s;ions, very neatly made of wicker-work, for carrying and holding their provi&s;ions, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Tools.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR tools are not many, but an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which they are de&s;igned. They have adzes, axes and chi&s;|&s;els. The chi&s;&s;el &s;erves equally for an auger; they having no contrivance to bore holes. Ha|ving no metal, their axes and adzes are made
<PB N="209" REF="217">of a hard, black &s;tone, and their chizzels of hu|man bone, or pieces of ja&s;per, chipped from a block, like gun-flints. They have a variety of &s;mall tools of ja&s;per for fini&s;hing their neat work, which, when grown blunt, are thrown away, having no method of &s;harpening them.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the in&s;trument with which they till their land, it is a&s;toni&s;hing to think how much work can be done in a little time. This in&s;trument, which &s;erves them both for plough and &s;pade, is nothing more than a long, narrow &s;take, cut to an edge at one end, about three inches broad, with a &s;hort piece fixed tran&s;ver&s;e|ly at a little di&s;tance above it, for the conve|nience of the foot to pre&s;s it down. With this they will turn up pieces of &s;even or eight acres, and with great expedition, the &s;oil being light and &s;andy.</P>
<P>Tillage, weaving, and the other arts of peace, &s;eem to be practi&s;ed in the northern parts of this country; but the arts of war flouri&s;h through the whole.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Arms, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR declarations of ho&s;ti|lities are always accompanied with a war-&s;ong and dance, in which the wo|men
<PB N="210" REF="218">often join: during this exultation, they &s;tamp their feet violently, hideou&s;ly writhe their bodies, roll their eyes, thru&s;t out their tongues, fetch loud and deep &s;ighs, and di&s;tort their faces in the mo&s;t horrid manner; and, when they begin the attack, it is by &s;houting and brandi&s;hing their weapons.</P>
<P>Upon a wi&s;h of Captain Cook's to &s;ee their method of attack and defence, one young man mounted a fighting &s;tage, which is a platform rai&s;ed from the ground, and &s;urrounded with a ditch, of which they have many large ones on the &s;ides of hills; and another went into the ditch: both he that was to defend the place, and he that was to attack it, &s;ung the war-&s;ong, and danced in the frightful manner I have de|&s;cribed, working them&s;elves up into a degree of mechanical rage: this done, they attacked each other with uncommon fury. They fir&s;t pierce with a lance, and then proceed to knock their enemy on the head with a &s;hort club.</P>
<P>The perpetual ho&s;tilities in which the&s;e peo|ple live, owing to there being &s;o little land in a &s;tate of cultivation, have made every village a fort; and they &s;eem to have &s;tudied more the in&s;truments of war than tho&s;e of peace. Had they any kind of order or military di&s;cipline
<PB N="211" REF="219">among them, they would be much more for|midable in arms than they are, for no quarter is given to the enemy.</P>
<P>They have no mi&s;&s;ile weapon but the lance, which is fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed at both ends, and barbed, and &s;ometimes headed with bone; the&s;e are gra&s;ped by the middle and thrown by the hand. They make u&s;e of darts or &s;horter lances at times, and al&s;o of &s;tones; but have no contrivance like the bow to convey their darts, nor any &s;uch thing as a &s;ling. Their other weapons are, battle-axes, a &s;taff about five feet long, broad at one end, like an oar, and pointed at the other, and the <HI>patoo|patoo,</HI> which is generally made of green talc, well poli&s;hed, about a foot long, and thick enough to weigh four or five pounds: it is made like a pointed battledore, with a &s;hort handle and &s;harp edges, well contrived for clo&s;e fight|ing, as it would &s;plit the thicke&s;t &s;cull at a &s;ingle blow. Through the handle of this weapon is a &s;tring, which is twi&s;ted round the hand when u&s;ed. The principal people con&s;ider this in&s;trument as a military ornament, and con&s;tant|ly wear it &s;ticking in their girdles. Their en|gagements, whether in boats or on &s;hore, are generally hand to hand; the &s;laughter of
<PB N="212" REF="220">cour&s;e mu&s;t be dreadful, as a &s;econd blow from their weapons is unnece&s;&s;ary, if the fir&s;t takes place.</P>
<P>The chiefs carry about them a &s;taff of di&s;tinc|tion, generally the rib of a whale, white as &s;now, ornamented round the top with carving, dog-&s;kin and feathers, like our &s;heriffs halberts; but &s;ometimes this &s;taff is merely a &s;tick, about &s;ix feet long, adorned in the &s;ame manner, and inlaid with a &s;hell re&s;embling mother of pearl.</P>

<HEAD>Canoes.</HEAD>
<P>THE ingenuity of the&s;e people appears in nothing more than their canoes: they are of different &s;izes, narrow and long, and re&s;emble very much the New England whale-boat. Some of the larger &s;ort &s;eem to be built chiefly for war, and will contain from forty to near a hundred armed men, being near &s;eventy feet long, though not more than five feet broad, and about three feet and a half in depth. The &s;ides are made &s;trait, of three entire planks, one above another, which reach from end to end, and are &s;ewed together by a &s;tring, made of the flax-plant, and caulked with the woolly &s;ub&s;tance of the reed-mace. The &s;ides being &s;trait, and the bottom &s;harp, they are in form of a wedge. A con&s;iderable
<PB N="213" REF="221">number of thwarts or &s;eats are laid from gun|wale to gunwale, in order to &s;trengthen them, and a profu&s;ion of carved ornaments decorate the head and &s;tern, which project beyond the body, ri&s;ing almo&s;t perpendicularly five or &s;ix feet above it, are pierced through and through in &s;pirals, like fillagree-work, and are adorned with &s;treamers hanging from them. The gun|wales of their be&s;t boats are al&s;o carved in a grote&s;que ta&s;te, and ornamented with tufts of white feathers placed upon a black ground.</P>
<P>The&s;e boats are worked on by eighteen or twenty &s;mall light paddles, about &s;ix feet long, neatly made, having an oval blade, pointed at the bottom, and gradually lo&s;ing its oval form in the handle; and the Indians have &s;uch an adroitne&s;s and manual dexterity in u&s;ing the&s;e paddles, that thirty of them together will keep time &s;o exactly, that one would think the rowers were actuated by one common &s;oul. Sails of matting fixed upright, between two poles, are &s;ometimes made u&s;e of; but they can make no way with the&s;e, except right before the wind.

<HEAD>Religion, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE can be &s;aid of their religion, except that they wor&s;hip a &s;upreme Being, believe in &s;ubordinate deities, and give nearly the &s;ame account of the origin of the world, &amp;c. as they do at O-Ta|heitee.</P>
<P>They make offerings of provi&s;ions occa|&s;ionally to the inferior gods; but what other homage they pay could not be learned, as no place of wor&s;hip was &s;een in the i&s;land, nor any religious ceremonies. They &s;eem to pay a de|gree of veneration to a &s;pecies of creeper, which they call <HI>atuee,</HI> or the bird of the divinity; but they never expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve the life of this bird in preference to any other.</P>
<P>What they do with their dead I cannot take upon me to &s;ay: in the northern parts they told their European vi&s;itors that they buried them in the ground, and in the &s;outhern parts, that they threw them into the &s;ea, with a &s;tone fa&s;|tened to them, to &s;ink them. No &s;uch a thing as a grave was &s;een in the i&s;land, nor any mo|nument, except in one place, where a cro&s;s was erected, ornamented with feathers. This was de&s;igned to perpetuate the memory of &s;ome
<PB N="216" REF="224">friend or relation; but the particulars could not be learned, as they make a my&s;tery of the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>The only ceremony ob&s;erved at the death of a kin&s;man was, that of &s;carifying the body of the &s;urvivors. Women, at the decea&s;e of their hu&s;bands, and men at that of their neare&s;t rela|tions, cut their arms, thighs and faces with &s;harp &s;hells, in a very dreadful manner, and it is a con&s;iderable time before the wounds are healed.</P>

<HEAD>Cu&s;toms.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;mall &s;ocieties in the &s;outh|ern i&s;land have &s;everal things in common, particularly their fine clothes and fi&s;hing-nets. Their fine clothes are pre&s;erved in a place by them&s;elves, in the middle of their towns, and part of their nets are found in al|mo&s;t every hou&s;e; for, when they go out to fi&s;h, they collect the&s;e parts and join them to|gether.</P>
<P>The women here &s;eem to be held in le&s;s e&s;ti|mation than in the other South Sea i&s;lands; they carrying, at New Zealand, all the burdens, and doing all the drudgery. Dr. For&s;ter was an eye witne&s;s of the ferocity of the natives with re|&s;pect to the women. A boy, about &s;ix or &s;even years old, demanded a piece of boiled penguin, which his mother held in her hands, but &s;he not immediately complying, he took up a large &s;tone and threw it at her. Incen&s;ed at this, the woman ran to puni&s;h him; but &s;he had &s;carce given him a blow, before her hu&s;band fell upon her, beat her in an unmerciful manner, da&s;hed her again&s;t the ground, and was very near kil|ling her. Ill treatment of the weaker &s;ex is carried here to exce&s;s; and, contrary to every principle of morality, boys are taught from their
<PB N="218" REF="226">infancy to hold their mothers in contempt. It is the employment of the men to till the ground, catch birds, make nets, and go out to fi&s;h, and that of the women to dig up fern roots, collect lob&s;ters and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, near the beach, cook, and weave their cloth; nay, the women it is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes go out to war, for many were &s;een carrying &s;pears.</P>
<P>The&s;e people have but few cu&s;toms among them but what are common to the other South Sea i&s;lands; addre&s;&s;ing a &s;tranger in a formal &s;peech or oration, while they pre&s;ent a green branch or a white bird's &s;kin, and then putting on their own coat upon him, is a &s;ignal and cere|monial of amity; waving the hand, and crying out <HI>Horomai,</HI> is a token of friend&s;hip; and putting no&s;es together is their mode of &s;aluta|tion.

<HEAD>Character.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition of this people &s;eems to be mild and gentle: they treat each other with great attention and affection, but are implacable towards their enemies, to whom they give no quarter. It may at fir&s;t appear &s;trange, that where conque&s;t
<PB N="219" REF="227">is attended with little advantage, there &s;hould be frequent wars; but if we con&s;ider, that &s;elf|pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of nature; that the principal food of the i&s;landers is fi&s;h, and that this is only to be caught upon the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and in &s;ufficient quantities, at certain times only, and of cour&s;e that the inland tribes, without a con&s;tant look-out to pre&s;erve this food, mu&s;t be in frequent danger of peri&s;hing by famine; I &s;ay, when this is con&s;idered, we may readily account, not only for their fortifying their little towns, but for the horrid cu&s;tom of eat|ing their pri&s;oners of war; for, when a man is pre&s;&s;ed by hunger to take up arms, every natural feeling is lo&s;t, and every &s;entiment that would otherwi&s;e re&s;train him from allaying it with the body of his adver&s;ary is ab&s;orbed. If this account of the origin of feeding on human fle&s;h be admitted as plau&s;ible, the rea&s;on of its continuance will readily be &s;een; for, when the practice has been begun by hunger, it will na|turally be kept alive by revenge; for among tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to eat the dead, death mu&s;t have lo&s;t much of its horror; and where it has lo&s;t much of its horror, there will not be a great repugnance to kill, e&s;pecially when a
<PB N="220" REF="228">de&s;ire to de&s;troy is whetted by an implacable revenge.</P>
<P>Though the New Zealanders are more irra&s;|cible than the other South Sea i&s;landers in ge|neral, they are, however, le&s;s immode&s;t, having &s;ome idea of indecency. They are as decent and re&s;erved in their actions as the polite&s;t per&s;ons in Europe. The women are not im|pregnable, indeed, but their terms and man|ner of compliance do them honour. When an overture is made to any young woman, the party is given to under&s;tand, that the con&s;ent of friends is nece&s;&s;ary; that a &s;uitable pre&s;ent mu&s;t be made; that the con&s;enting female mu&s;t be treated with good manners and delicacy; that no unbecoming liberties mu&s;t be taken, and that the day-light mu&s;t not be a witne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;es between them. An agreement thus made is con&s;idered by them as innocent as a marriage ceremonial in England; many of the women are, however, as great coquets as the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable ladies in Europe, and the young ones are exceedingly &s;kitti&s;h.</P>
<P>The young unmarried women would not have been very liberal of their favours to the European &s;eamen, had it not been often by the compul&s;ion of their fathers and brothers,
<PB N="221" REF="229">who bartered their virtue for iron tools. The idea of female cha&s;tity in New Zealand is very different from ours; for a girl may favour a number of lovers, without any &s;tigma upon her character; but, if &s;he marries, conjugal fidelity is exacted from her with the utmo&s;t rigour.</P>
<P>But if the New Zealanders are more mode&s;t than the natives of O-Taheitee, they are le&s;s cleanly; for the climate being colder, they do not &s;o often bathe. This, however, might be di&s;pen&s;ed with, if they did not render them|&s;elves filthy, by the oil with which they grea&s;e their hair: the better kind of people u&s;e it fre&s;h, but the lower cla&s;s anoint their heads with rancid oil, which makes them &s;mell like a Hottentot; and, add to this, notwith&s;tanding they have combs both of bone and wood, mo&s;t of them are intolerably lou&s;y; nay, the vermin that in|fe&s;t their heads may be often &s;een crawling upon their cloaths, and &s;o lo&s;t are they to cleanline&s;s, that they will occa&s;ionally crack them between their teeth and eat them.</P>
<P>The chief of di&s;ea&s;es taking their ri&s;e from intemperance and want of exerci&s;e, both of which are unknown to the&s;e i&s;landers, it is no matter of wonder that they enjoy perfect and uninterrupted health. Among hundreds of every
<PB N="222" REF="230">age, not an eruption, nor any mark of one, was &s;een upon their &s;kin, nor any bodily complaint. Their wounds heal naturally of them&s;elves, with|out any topical application; and, among a great number of very old men, they were all ob|&s;erved to be chearful, and none of them de|crepid.</P>
<P>While they con&s;idered the Europeans as their enemies, and as coming to make an advantage of them, they did not &s;cruple to plunder them, as opportunity &s;erved, and to de&s;cend to little acts of unfairne&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty: they would receive the price of what they offered to &s;ale, and, when done, pack up the purcha&s;e and pur|cha&s;e money, with great compo&s;ure, and march off with it as lawful plunder; but, when they began to be acquainted with their vi&s;itors, they wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h a mutual confidence, and never pre&s;umed to pilfer any thing.</P>
<P>As the reader may probably wi&s;h to know the reception the fir&s;t Europeans met with, who touched at New Zealand, the following will gratify him:</P>
<P>When Captain Ta&s;man touched at <HI>Eahie-no|mauwe,</HI> in 1642, they would not &s;uffer him, nor any of his people, to go a&s;hore; but attacked the &s;hip's boat and murdered three of his men.
<PB N="223" REF="231">This led him to call the bay where he anchored, <HI>Murderers Bay.</HI> But as they have no tradition of any European ve&s;&s;el paying them a vi&s;it, before that of Captain Cook, in October 1769, his may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t. As &s;oon as he ca&s;t anchor, he, accompanied with a party, put off for the &s;hore, and landed in &s;ight of a number of people a&s;&s;embled on the beach, leaving four boys, with the cock&s;wain, to take care of the boat. As &s;oon as they landed, the people ran away; but, when he had got to &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea &s;ide, four armed men ru&s;hed forward to &s;eize the boat, which was prevented by the boys putting off from the &s;hore, and the cock&s;wain's firing a mu&s;quet and killing one of tho&s;e who attacked him. When this man fell, the other three &s;tood motionle&s;s for &s;ome time, almo&s;t petrified with a&s;toni&s;h|ment; pre&s;ently after, recovering their &s;urprize, they dragged the dead body away with them, and left Captain Cook and his party an oppor|tunity to return. But the next day, taking with him a native of the Society I&s;les, whom he brought with him, and who was under&s;tood by the New Zealanders, the nature of his vi&s;it was explained, and a friendly intercour&s;e took place between them; but not till three or four were
<PB N="224" REF="232">killed by mu&s;quet-balls, for attempting to plunder the &s;hip. Three boys being taken by force on board the ve&s;&s;el, they had no other expectation than to be in&s;tantly put to death; but, when they found them&s;elves treated with ge|nero&s;ity and kindne&s;s, their joy was beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion. They continued on board till the next day, and, being &s;ent on &s;hore, dre&s;&s;ed and de|corated with bracelets and necklaces, they re|pre&s;ented to the natives the kind treatment they had received from the Europeans, and thus e&s;tabli&s;hed a peace between them. They met al&s;o with &s;ome oppo&s;ition in landing at other parts of the i&s;land, and a native or two fell in the di&s;pute; but matters were &s;oon &s;ettled, and an amicable intercour&s;e &s;ucceeded; for tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to fire-arms mu&s;t naturally dread the very thought of them. It was &s;o here; and, when the i&s;landers found them&s;elves not &s;afe from a di&s;charge of the cannon, even at great di&s;tances, they gave up all attempts at oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention, however, a dread|ful affair that happened to Captain Furneaux's people, when in Charlotte Sound, in December 1773. A mid&s;hipman, with nine of the boat's crew, being &s;ent on &s;hore to gather greens, were
<PB N="225" REF="233">taken and put to death, and eaten by the &s;a|vages. It was afterwards learnt, that on one of the natives, &s;tealing a &s;eaman's jacket, the mid|&s;hipman gave orders to fire at them. Thus war commenced between them, and, when they had fired away all their ammunition, they fell a &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of their enemies.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Dufre&s;ne Marion, who had the command of two &s;hips from France, and who put into a bay in di&s;tre&s;s, at the northern i&s;land of New Zealand, in 1772, was, with twenty|eight of his men, murdered by the natives. Having lo&s;t his ma&s;ts, he was obliged to &s;earch the woods of this country for new ones; and, though he had lived upon the be&s;t terms with the i&s;landers for thirty-three days, he, with his men, were &s;urprized and cut off. But not|with&s;tanding the&s;e two tran&s;actions, the New Zealanders mu&s;t be acquitted of either treachery or cruel malevolence; for it is greatly to be &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome umbrage was taken at &s;ome|thing done by the &s;trangers, and that the affair was revenged with that pa&s;&s;ionate fury which hurries on a &s;avage to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>As there is &s;omething very uncommon in part of this bu&s;ine&s;s, I will clo&s;e the account of New Zealand with the relation. The carpenters were
<PB N="226" REF="234">encamped in the woods, under the protection of a M. Crozet, with a &s;mall party, for the pur|po&s;e of making new ma&s;ts, &amp;c. Upon the news, therefore, of Captain Marion and his men being cut off, a corporal and four marines were di&s;patched to M. Crozet to acquaint him with his danger, while &s;everal boats waited to receive him. M. Crozet immediately di&s;po&s;ed every thing, as well as he could, to effect a retreat; but &s;oon found him&s;elf in &s;ight of a prodigious crowd of the natives, led on by &s;everal chiefs. He directed the four marines to be ready to fire at &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;hould point out, if ne|ce&s;&s;ity required it, and then ordered all his party to &s;trike their tents and retire with their tools to the boats, while he advanced up to one of the chiefs. This man told him that M. Marion was killed by another chief, whom he named. At this M. Crozet &s;tuck a &s;take into the ground, ju&s;t before the feet of the chief, and bid him advance no farther. The boldne&s;s of the action &s;tartled the &s;avage, which, being ob&s;erved by M. Crozet, he in&s;i&s;ted on his commanding the croud to &s;it down, which was accordingly com|plied with. He now walked up and down be|fore the natives, till all his men were in the boat: his &s;oldiers were ordered to follow, and
<PB N="227" REF="235">him&s;elf was the la&s;t who embarked. Scarce was the boat put off from the &s;hore, but the &s;avages began their &s;ong of defiance, and threw &s;tones at him; however, by the exertion of his people, he got &s;afe on board. This, however, did not intimidate M. Crozet; for, finding him|&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of procuring new ma&s;ts, he landed again with a party, attacked one of their fortifications, and cut a breach in it; an armed chief in&s;tantly &s;tepped into it, and was &s;hot dead, another &s;tepped on the dead body and occupied his place, he likewi&s;e fell a victim to M. Crozet's heroi&s;m, and in like manner fell eight chiefs, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively defended, and bravely fell upon this po&s;t of honour. The re&s;t, &s;eeing their leaders dead, fled, and many were pur&s;ued and killed. In &s;hort, after this enterprize, M. Crozet completed the repairs of his &s;hip, without interruption, and pro&s;ecuted his voyage, after a &s;tay of &s;ixty-four days.</P>

<HEAD>SALOMON ISLANDS,</HEAD>
<P>NOW known by the name of Nova Bri|tannia, con&s;i&s;t of New Britain, New Ireland, New Hanover, and a number of &s;maller i&s;lands. They lie in the neighbourhood of New Guinea, in about 210&deg; W. longitude, and 5&deg; S. lati|tude, about two thou&s;and five hundred leagues W. from America; were fir&s;t di&s;covered by Mendana, in 1567, and by him called Salomon, and afterwards New Britain, by Dampier, in 1700.</P>
<P>As the&s;e i&s;lands were merely coa&s;ted, little can be &s;aid of the country or the inhabitants: New Ireland is ninety-five leagues long, twenty broad, and above two hundred in circuit, and the face of that i&s;land, as well as New Britain, and their neighbouring i&s;les, is mountainous, beautifully romantic, picture&s;que, and well cloathed with trees of enormous growth. The heat of the climate may be known by Faren|heit's thermometer, which &s;tood at 22&deg; and 23&deg; through the whole month of July. New Ire|land
<PB N="229" REF="237">and New Hanover received their names from Captain Carteret, who touched there in 1766.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are &s;uppo&s;ed to be very popu|lous, from the many thou&s;ands that appeared on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and are fertile in provi&s;ions and cattle. The inhabitants are black and woolly headed, like negroes, but have not the thick lip and flat no&s;e. They go naked, ex|cept covering their privities with a piece of mat, and wearing bracelets and anclets of &s;hells: their ears are generally long, and they bore them to carry earings: their teeth are red, from chewing <HI>betel,</HI> and they powder their hair and beards abundantly with a white powder. They occa&s;ionally wear plumes upon their heads, large, round white plates of &s;hells hanging to their necks, and rings through the cartilages of their no&s;es: and, if we may judge of the people by their mi&s;erable dwellings, they mu&s;t &s;tand low even in the &s;cale of &s;avage life. Their food is cocoa-nuts and roots, though they occa&s;ion|ally eat human fle&s;h: they adore &s;nakes, toads and &s;uch things; are a people who live in &s;mall communities; have frequent wars among them|&s;elves, and make &s;laves of their pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="238">The tide at New Ireland ebbs and flows once in four and twenty hours, and ri&s;es at the &s;pring between eight and nine feet.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of the&s;e i&s;lands is light, and their productions are cocoa-nuts in plenty, betel, the areca, the fine Indian reed, mangle-apples, va|rious &s;pecies of the palm, aloe, canes, bam|boos, rattans, with many trees, &s;hrubs, and plants unknown to Europeans. There are al&s;o the nutmeg and pepper tree; but no e&s;culent vegetable of any kind. The thatch palm was al&s;o &s;een there, and the cabbage tree, the fruit of which is a white, cri&s;p, juicy &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ome|what like a che&s;nut when eaten raw, and, when boiled, &s;uperior to the be&s;t par&s;hip. Among the trees, is one bearing a plumb, with a plea|&s;ant tarti&s;h ta&s;te, not unlike a Jamaica plumb.</P>
<P>Of the animal kind, there are dogs, wild boars, and tiger-cats; turtles, &s;erpents, &s;nakes, &s;cor|pions, centipedes, and a number of in&s;ects of a &s;in|gular &s;ort. One of the&s;e is three or four inches long, covered over with a kind of armour, with &s;ix legs, projecting points on the &s;ides, and a very long tail; another about three inches long, belonging to the Mantis genus: almo&s;t every part of its body is of &s;uch a texture, that it appears like a leaf, even when we are clo&s;ely
<PB N="231" REF="239">examining it: each of its wings is one half of a leaf, which, when clo&s;ed together, &s;eem one entire leaf: the under &s;ide of its body wears the appearance al&s;o of a leaf, but of a more dead colour than the upper one: the creature has two antennae and &s;ix legs, the upper joints of which are al&s;o &s;imilar to parts of leaves.</P>
<P>Of birds there are great variety. European poultry; large pigeons, of great beauty, their plumage, green-gold, their neck and belly of a greyi&s;h white, with a little cre&s;t upon their heads. Another large cre&s;ted pigeon, near as big as a turkey, of azure plumage, called a Crowned Bird in the Moluccas, which has a plaintive note like the cries of men; and another kind who&s;e cry re&s;embles &s;o well the barking of a dog, that every one who hears it, for the fir&s;t time, mu&s;t be deceived by it. There are likewi&s;e turtle-doves, and widow birds, larger than tho&s;e of the Bra&s;ils.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h al&s;o abound upon the coa&s;ts in large quantities, which the natives take with nets. They are not without &s;ome rock oy&s;ters, and very large cockles, &s;o large as to &s;pread five feet between point and point of the &s;hell.</P>
<P>Their canoes are very long and very narrow, with an outrigger: &s;ome of them reach to
<PB N="232" REF="240">ninety feet in length, and yet are formed of a &s;ingle tree. The head and &s;tern are very much rai&s;ed, to &s;helter the people within from arrows, which is done by turning either end of the boat towards the enemy. Their canoes are decorated with carved work, and paddled on by thirty or forty rowers.</P>
<P>The offen&s;ive weapons of the&s;e people are, lances, bows and arrows, &s;lings, and long &s;ticks and poles, like the quarter-&s;taff. They have al&s;o &s;hields to defend them&s;elves. The&s;e of|fen&s;ive and defen&s;ive weapons, their dextrous management of them, and their boldne&s;s in attacking, is a convincing proof that they are almo&s;t con&s;tantly at war.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands being not a great way from New Holland, the cu&s;toms and manners of the natives mu&s;t be, in many re&s;pects, &s;imilar, I &s;hall proceed, therefore, to treat of the latter, being that of which we are be&s;t informed; for though M.

<P>IS an i&s;land of larger extent than any other in the known world.

<P>SOUTH of 33&deg; or 34&deg;, the land in ge|neral is low and level; more to the northward
<PB N="234" REF="242">it is hilly, but not mountainous.

<HEAD>Productions.</HEAD>
<P>OF timber-trees, there are but two &s;orts: the large&s;t is the gum tree, which grows all over the i&s;land: it yields a deep red gum, and the wood is heavy, hard and dark coloured, like the <HI>lignum vitae,</HI> with narrow leaves, like tho&s;e of the willow. The other grows tall and upright, re&s;embling the pine, &s;omething like the live oak of Ame|rica. The wood al&s;o of this tree is hard and heavy. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are trees, having a &s;oft bark, ea&s;ily peeled off, the &s;ame that is u&s;ed for caulking of &s;hips in the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="243">There are palms al&s;o of three different &s;orts; one who&s;e leaves are plaited like a fan, the cab|bages of which are &s;mall, but exceedingly &s;weet; another like the We&s;t India cabbage tree, with large pinnated leaves, like the cocoa|nut, producing large fruit, and a third about ten feet high, with &s;maller pinnated leaves, bear|ing no cabbage, but abundance of nuts, about the &s;ize of che&s;nuts. They have, among other trees, one that bears a fruit, in colour and &s;ize not unlike a cherry, who&s;e juice, indeed, has no great flavour, but an agreeable tartne&s;s. The borders or banks of the bays, of which there are many, are covered with mangroves, and the i&s;land abounds with a number of &s;mall trees and flowering &s;hrubs, unknown to Europeans. There is one tree which produces a &s;ort of fig, but very poor; another that bears a plumb, flat on the &s;ides, like a dried medlar; and a third, that bears a kind of purple apple, in ta&s;te &s;ome|thing like a dama&s;cene.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o a great variety of plants un|known to us, but very few of the e&s;culent kind, except a &s;ort of bean, growing on a &s;talk that creeps along the ground; a kind of par&s;ley and porcelain; two &s;pecies of yams, one &s;haped like a par&s;nip, the other round, and a plant
<PB N="236" REF="244">called Coccos, the leaves of which are little in|ferior to &s;pinnage. I mu&s;t not forget to men|tion here, that the ground is almo&s;t every where covered with a gra&s;s, who&s;e &s;eeds, in the month of May, are very trouble&s;ome to the walker; they are &s;harp and bearded backwards, &s;o that when they &s;tick in one's cloaths, which they do at every &s;tep, they are worked forwards by means of the beard, till they reach the fle&s;h and prick it.</P>

<HEAD>Animals.</HEAD>
<P>OF quadrupeds there are &s;everal that we are unacquainted with; but, as they could not be caught, no de&s;cription can be given of them. They &s;eem to be of the wolf, polecat, and weazel kind. There are goats, but no tame animals, except dogs. They have the opo&s;&s;um, a creature with a membra|nous bag near the &s;tomach, in which it conceals and carries its young, when apprehen&s;ive of danger. They have al&s;o a remarkable animal, about the &s;ize of a &s;heep, called a Kanguroo, &s;ome of which will weigh upwards of eighty pounds, and are not bad eating, re&s;embling the fle&s;h of a hare, but better flavoured. Its body is formed like a goo&s;e, large&s;t behind, and growing taper to the head, which re&s;embles that
<PB N="237" REF="245">of a fawn; it has lips and ears, which it throws back, like a hare's; on the upper jaw it has &s;ix large teeth, on the under one, only two; its neck is &s;hort and &s;mall, near to which are the fore feet, which have five toes, each with nails like a cat. The fore legs are kept clo&s;e to the brea&s;t, and &s;eem, like tho&s;e of a mole, to be u&s;ed only for digging; they are &s;mall, and not more than eight inches long, having no knee joint; but the hind legs have the cu&s;tomary joints of animals, and are twenty-two inches in length. It has a tail tapering to the end, as long as its whole body, which it carries like a grey-hound, and the whole animal is covered with a &s;hort fur, of a dark mou&s;e or grey colour. It &s;ets up on its hinder legs, like a hare in her form, and does not run, like other quadrupeds, but leaps like a hare or deer.</P>
<P>Of birds there are great variety, of exqui&s;ite beauty. Loriquets; fine large black cockatoos, with &s;carlet and orange-coloured feathers in their tails, and &s;ome white &s;pots on each wing, and al&s;o between the beak and ear. The&s;e fly in flocks of &s;cores together. They have al&s;o the goat-&s;ucker, or churn-owl; the bee-eaters; large bats; a &s;mall bird, with wattles of a deep orange red; another with wattles of a fine ultramarine
<PB N="238" REF="246">colour, with black beak and legs; an owl, having the iris of its eyes gold colour, and the pupil of them dark blue; a large black and white gull, with a bright yellow beak, on the gibbous part of which is a &s;carlet &s;pot, the corners of its mouth and irides of its eyes a bright &s;carlet, and its legs and feet a greeni&s;h yellow; a black bird, with a bright red beak, yellow at the point, the iris of its eyes &s;carlet, and the feet and legs a pale yellow; and many other curious &s;mall birds, unknown to Euro|peans. They have, likewi&s;e, quails and crows, re&s;embling ours, a &s;pecies of bu&s;tard, beautiful grey pigeons, with red beaks and reddi&s;h brown cre&s;ts; two &s;orts of doves; two &s;orts of paroquets; pied hawks; black and white kites and eagles.</P>
<P>Of the aquatic kind, herons, whi&s;tling ducks, that perch and roo&s;t on trees, wild gee&s;e, cur|lieus, a bird like a pelican, larger than a &s;wan, and other &s;orts of water-fowl.</P>
<P>Of the tribe of in&s;ects, they have green ca|terpillars, in great numbers, which range them|&s;elves on the mangrove leaves, &s;ide by &s;ide, twenty or thirty together, and who&s;e hair on their bodies &s;ting like a nettle; butterflies in &s;uch quantities, that, for the &s;pace of three or
<PB N="239" REF="247">four acres, the air is often &s;o crowded with them, that millions may be &s;een flying in every direc|tion, while every branch and twig in the neigh|bourhood is covered; ants al&s;o of different kinds, &s;ome white and others black; the black ants will perforate the twigs of the gum-tree, work out the pith, and occupy the pipe that contained it; yet the parts in which the&s;e in|&s;ects form a lodgment, and in which they &s;warm in amazing numbers, bear leaves and flowers, and appear to flouri&s;h as much as tho&s;e that are &s;ound. Upon the branches of the&s;e trees, the ants will often make ne&s;ts of clay as big as a bu&s;hel. There are ants as green as a leaf, that live upon trees, where they build their ne&s;ts of various &s;izes, from that of a man's fi&s;t, to the &s;ize of his head. The&s;e ne&s;ts are curiou&s;ly formed, by bending down &s;everal of the leaves, which are as broad as one's hand, and gluing the points of them together, &s;o as to form a pur&s;e; the glue u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion is an animal vi&s;cus, which nature has provided them with. Thou&s;ands will unite their &s;trength to bend down a leaf, which they do by their weight, while others employ the gluten to prevent its return. If di&s;turbed, they will throw them|&s;elves
<PB N="240" REF="248">upon their enemy and &s;ting him like a bee.</P>
<P>Of fi&s;h, they have &s;ting rays, rock and pearl oy&s;ters in &s;uch quantities, that a pearl fi&s;hery might be there e&s;tabli&s;hed to great advantage; mu&s;cles, and other &s;hell fi&s;h, cockles, &s;ome of which are as much as two men can move, and contain twenty pounds of good meat; crabs of two kinds, one adorned with the fine&s;t hue, equal to the ultramarine, with which all its claws and every joint is deeply tinged, and the under part white, and &s;o exqui&s;itely poli&s;hed, that, in colour and brightne&s;s, it re&s;embles the white of old china; the other kind is marked more &s;paringly with the ultramarine, but its back is beautifully &s;potted with brown. They have al&s;o plenty of turtles and water-&s;nakes, like land ones, except that their tails are broad and flat, which &s;erve them for fins; but among all the fi&s;h &s;een at the i&s;land, none is more remark|able than one that jumps: it is about the &s;ize of a minnow, and has two very &s;trong brea&s;t fins, by which it leaps as nimbly as a frog: it &s;eems not to prefer water more than land, for it will frequently leave the water, and pur&s;ue its way on dry ground.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="249">Of other reptiles they have alligators, &s;erpents, venomous and harmle&s;s, and lizards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>IN proportion to the extent of land, the number of inhabitants appears to be &s;mall; for though Captain Cook was upwards of three months upon the coa&s;t, and it is natural to have expected numbers &s;hould have flocked to the &s;ea-&s;ide, in order to view what mu&s;t &s;eem to them a wooden world, yet he never &s;aw &s;o many as thirty collected together; nor, when they formed a re&s;olution to oppo&s;e the Captain's landing, could they mu&s;ter more than fourteen or fifteen fighting men: neither do they appear to live in &s;ocieties, but, like other animals, to be &s;cattered about along the coa&s;t and in the woods. Nor, indeed, was a &s;pot of ground &s;een in a &s;tate of cultivation in any part of the i&s;land, a further proof of the thinne&s;s of the inhabitants; for where the &s;ea does not con|tribute to feed the inhabitants, the country mu&s;t be de&s;olate.</P>
<P>The complexion of the&s;e people is what is commonly called a Chocolate Colour, though they are &s;o uniformly covered with dirt that it is difficult to &s;ay what their true colour is. Their features are far from di&s;agreeable: their no&s;es
<PB N="242" REF="250">not being flat nor their lips thick: their teeth are white and even, and their hair, though they &s;inge it &s;hort, is naturally long and black, and generally &s;traight with a &s;light curl at bottom. They, &s;ome way or other, keep their hair free from lice, though they &s;eldom comb it, for it is in general matted and grea&s;y, but without oil or grea&s;e.</P>
<P>The beards of the men are of the &s;ame colour with their hair, and al&s;o bu&s;hy and thick, it never being &s;uffered to grow long. Their &s;tature is of the middle &s;ize, but &s;lender, and their bones &s;o &s;mall, that a common hand may &s;pan their an|cles and their arms above their elbows; and in general they are clean-limbed and remarkably vigorous, active and nimble. Their counte|nances are not without expre&s;&s;ion, and their voices are remarkably &s;oft and effeminate.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes go quite naked, without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of indecency; but &s;till they are not without their ornaments, the principal of which is, a bone five or &s;ix inches long, and as thick as a man's finger, which they thru&s;t through the &s;eptum of their no&s;es: it reaches quite acro&s;s the face, and &s;o effectually &s;tops up the no&s;trils, that the wearer, when he &s;peaks, &s;nuffles &s;o as &s;carce to be under&s;tood, and is obliged to keep
<PB N="243" REF="251">his mouth con&s;tantly open, in order to breathe freely. The &s;ailors, in humour, called it their Sprit&s;ail-yard. They wear al&s;o necklaces made of &s;hells, bracelets of &s;mall cord round the up|per part of their arms, and a &s;tring of human hair plaited, tied round the wai&s;t; and &s;ome were &s;een with large gorgets of &s;hells hanging on the brea&s;t, and a few women with feathers in their heads, &s;tuck on with gum. They paint them&s;elves red and white and du&s;t their faces with a white powder. The red is generally laid on in broad patches upon the brea&s;t and &s;houlders, and the white in &s;treaks, one round their thighs, two below their knees, one like a &s;a&s;h over their &s;houlders, and another acro&s;s their foreheads. They have holes al&s;o in their ears, but no ornaments were &s;een in them. On their bodies were noticed large &s;cars in irregular lines, apparently made by &s;ome blunt in&s;tru|ment, probably as memorials of grief for the dead.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Habitations.</HEAD>
<P>LIKE quadrupeds, they &s;eem, as was &s;aid before, not to live in &s;ocieties, but to wander about in the woods; and a farther rea&s;on to confirm this a&s;&s;ertion, is, that, in an extent of near two thou&s;and miles upon
<PB N="244" REF="252">the coa&s;t, nothing like a town or village was to be &s;een. Their huts are merely &s;heds to &s;leep in, &s;carce big enough for a man to &s;it under, and hardly large enough to cover his whole length. They are made with &s;ticks about an inch diameter, in the form of an oven, open at one end, by &s;ticking the two ends in the ground, and covering them with pieces of bark or palm leaves. They frequently make fires in the&s;e hou&s;es, and, as they &s;eldom wa&s;h or clean them|&s;elves, they thus become &s;moke-dried. Under the&s;e &s;heds they &s;leep, with their heads and knees together, &s;o that in this po&s;ition one hut will hold three or four per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The only furniture they have is an oblong ve&s;&s;el made of bark, contrived, by tying up the two ends with a withy, to carry water; and a &s;mall bag, knit like a cabbage-net, which the men carry on their backs by a &s;tring round their heads, for the purpo&s;e of conveying, from place to place, the little trea&s;ure they po&s;&s;e&s;s, generally only a lump or two of paint, a piece of re&s;in, &s;ome lines and fi&s;hing hooks, the bracelets, &amp;c. which they continually wear, and a few points of darts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="245" REF="253">
<HEAD>Food.</HEAD>
<P>EXCEPT the fruits and vegetables of the country, they eat little but fi&s;h: now and then, indeed, they kill the Kan|guroo, and occa&s;ionally a bird or turtle. Though they have no ve&s;&s;el to boil water in, they do not &s;eem to eat animal food raw: they broil it and bake it with hot &s;tones in an oven, in the &s;ame manner they do at O-Taheitee. They were con&s;tantly ob&s;erved chewing a leaf, but of what quality it was could not be learned; all that can be &s;aid is, that it had no vi&s;ible ef|fect upon the teeth or lips.</P>
<P>Having no nets, they catch fi&s;h only by &s;trik|ing it with a fi&s;h-gig, or by hooks and lines, except &s;uch as they find in the hollows of the rocks, and &s;hoals when the water ebbs. Their hooks are very neatly made, and &s;ome of them are exceedingly &s;mall. Their lines are from half an inch to the finene&s;s of a hair, and are made of &s;ome vegetable &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Birds they catch when at roo&s;t, and animals they kill with their lances, when they pa&s;s by a tree, in the branches of which they conceal them&s;elves for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Their method of procuring fire and &s;preading it is worth remarking. To produce it, they take two pieces of &s;oft, dry wood, one a round
<PB N="246" REF="254">&s;tick of about eight or nine inches long, the other piece flat: one end of the round piece they &s;hape into an obtu&s;e point, and make a hole in the flat piece. In this hole they twirl the end of the &s;tick between their hands, as we do a chocolate mill, pre&s;&s;ing it down in the hole, till it fires. By this method they get fire in le&s;s than two minutes, and, from the &s;malle&s;t &s;park, they in|crea&s;e it with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;peed. They will wrap up a &s;park in a little dry gra&s;s, which, by moving, will be fanned into a flame. Thus a man will run on for miles, and, without any vi&s;ible fire in his hands, will, at every fifty or a hundred yards, &s;toop down and leave fire behind him.</P>
<P>One of their methods of annoying their Euro|pean vi&s;itors, whom they con&s;idered as enemies, was, by &s;etting fire to the high gra&s;s in the neigh|bourhood of the place where the tents were fixed; which being dry as &s;tubble, burnt with amazing force and did incredible mi&s;chief.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Arms.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR weapons are &s;pears and lances of different kinds, &s;ome with four prongs, pointed with bone and barbed, the points of which are covered with a hard re|&s;in, which gives them a poli&s;h and facilitates their entrance into what they &s;trike: others
<PB N="247" REF="255">have only one point, with the &s;haft made of a light jointed cane, from eight to fourteen feet long; others are barbed all the way up the &s;haft. They are very dextrous in throwing them, and will convey them forcibly with the hand ten or twenty yards; but if they wi&s;h to convey them further, they make u&s;e of a throwing-&s;tick, which is a plain, &s;mooth piece of hard wood highly poli&s;hed, about two inches broad, half an inch thick and three feet long, with a &s;mall knob or nook at one end, and a cro&s;s piece about three or four inches long at the other. In the &s;haft of the lance, near the point, is made a hollow to receive the knob of the throwing-&s;tick, from which it ea&s;ily &s;lips on being impelled forward. To throw it they lay the lance along upon this in&s;trument and hold it over the &s;houlder; and, after &s;haking, throw both the &s;tick and lance with all their force; but the &s;tick being &s;topped by the cro&s;s piece which comes again&s;t the the &s;houlder with a jerk, the lance flies forward with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, and with &s;uch good aim, that the thrower is more &s;ure of his mark at fifty yards di&s;tance, than a mu&s;queteer is of his ball. They have al&s;o bows and arrows, and an oblong &s;hield three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, made of bark; and a wooden

<HEAD>Canoes.</HEAD>
<P>THE canoes of New Holland are as wretched as their hou&s;es. To the &s;outhward they are made of one piece of bark, about twelve feet long, tied up at the ends, and &s;pread open in the middle by two &s;ticks. In &s;hallow water they pu&s;h them on by a pole, and in deep water by paddles, two of which they u&s;e at a time. More to the northward they are made of the trunk of a tree, fourteen feet long, hol|lowed out by fire. They are in general very narrow, and furni&s;hed with an out-rigger to pre|vent their over&s;etting. They never carry more than four people.</P>

<HEAD>Tools.</HEAD>
<P>The only tools &s;een among them were, an adze made of &s;tone, wedges of the &s;ame, wooden mallets, and a few &s;hells and pieces of coral.

<P>SOME idea of their language may be collected from the fol|lowing li&s;t of words. They articulate plainly, though in &s;peaking they make a great motion with their lips.

<P>THESE people have no idea of traffick, nor could any be given them; for all the &s;igns made to them, de&s;cribing a return for things pre&s;ented to them were fruit|le&s;s: they did not &s;eem to under&s;tand them. This indifference with re&s;pect to buying kept them hone&s;t: they never attempted to purloin any thing, but, if refu&s;ed what they wi&s;hed for, they attempted to take it by force. They &s;eemed to &s;et no value upon any thing that was given them, for, like play-things given to chil|dren, they plea&s;ed only while they were new. Nor do they &s;eem to have any curio&s;ity; for though walking on the &s;ea &s;hore in &s;ight of the &s;hip, a wonderful machine they had never &s;een before,
<PB N="251" REF="259">of numbers that trudged along, &s;carce one ca&s;t an eye towards it.</P>
<P>They introduce &s;trangers into company by their names as they do in England.</P>
<P>Whether they are brave or not cannot truly be a&s;certained: they made &s;ome little oppo&s;ition on the crew's landing, but they were &s;oon inti|midated by the fire arms, as a few pieces fired with &s;mall &s;hot pre&s;ently di&s;per&s;ed them, and, after the fir&s;t conte&s;t, they would never come near enough to parley; &s;o that the Europeans could by no means form the lea&s;t connection with them. How it happens that there are &s;o few inhabitants, is not ea&s;y to devi&s;e: whether they are de&s;troyed by each other in conte&s;ts for food, whether &s;wept off by famine, or their increa&s;e prevented by any particular cau&s;e, can|not be at pre&s;ent determined. That they have wars among&s;t them is evident by their weapons, but what gives ri&s;e to the&s;e wars, or what is the con&s;equence of them, cannot be a&s;certained: the few facts that could be picked up we here give our reader, and he mu&s;t be left to rea&s;on for him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CAMCHATCA, OR KAMSCHATKA,</HEAD>
<P>IS that great penin&s;ula which makes the boundary of A&s;ia to the north ea&s;t, and &s;tretches from north to &s;outh, about 7&deg; 30&prime;. The be|ginning of this penin&s;ula is at the rivers Pu&s;|taia and Anapho, lying in 59&deg; 30&prime; N. latitude. At the&s;e places, the i&s;thmus is &s;o narrow, that, in fair weather, the &s;ea may be &s;een on both &s;ides, from the hills in the middle. The figure of the penin&s;ula is &s;omewhat eliptical, being broader towards the middle, and growing nar|rower towards both ends. The country north of the i&s;thmus, is called Zeno&s;&s;e, and is under the government of Anadir.</P>
<P>Camchatca was long known to the geogra|phers of former times, but it never could be

<P>The &s;outhern part of the penin&s;ula is called Lopatha, and lies in 51&deg; 3&prime; N. latitude; the difference of longitude from Peter&s;burgh is found to be at Ochot&s;koy 112&deg; 53&prime; E.</P>

<P>CAMCHATCA is plentifully furni&s;hed with rivers, but &s;o &s;mall, that none except one is navigable. This will carry ve&s;&s;els two hun|dred ver&s;ts upwards, from its mouth.</P>

<HEAD>Productions.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the banks of the na|vigable river, is found plenty of roots and berries, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply the want of corn. Near the head of this river, both &s;ummer and winter, corn would grow as well as in other places of the &s;ame la|titude, the &s;oil being deep and rich; for though the &s;now falls in very great quantities, yet it thaws early enough, and the &s;pring is not &s;o wet, nor have they &s;uch damps there as in many other places. Several trials of &s;ummer-corn have been made, in which both barley and oats have &s;ucceeded; but it cannot be expected that they &s;hould &s;ow any great quantities, as, for
<PB N="254" REF="262">want of hor&s;es, they are obliged to plough their land with men.</P>
<P>As to vegetables, the mo&s;t &s;ucculent plants produce only leaves and &s;talks: cabbage and lettuce never come to perfection, and peas con|tinue in blo&s;&s;om till late in the harve&s;t, without yielding &s;o much as a pod; but &s;ucculent roots, &s;uch as turneps and radi&s;hes, thrive very well. The gra&s;s runs up near &s;ix feet high, e&s;pecially near the rivers and lakes, and grows &s;o fa&s;t, that it is &s;ometimes mowed three times in a &s;ummer. The cattle, therefore, are large and fat, and give plenty of milk all the year, for the gra&s;s continues full of juice, even to the beginning of winter, and this juice being conden&s;ed by the cold, prevents the gra&s;s from turning hard during that &s;ea&s;on, &s;o that there is feed all the winter. Places where the gra&s;s thus grows, are never &s;o much covered with &s;now as the bogs and &s;wamps, and, on this account, it is diffi|cult to pa&s;s over them in winter. There is plenty of wood in this country, not only for building hou&s;es, but even for &s;hip-build|ing.</P>

<HEAD>Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>THE natives of Camchatca are as wild as the country it&s;elf. Some of them have no fixed habitations, but wander from place to place, with their herds of rein deer; others have &s;ettled dwellings, and re&s;ide upon the banks of the rivers and the &s;ea &s;hores.</P>
<P>They are divided into three nations, the Cam|chatcans, the Koreki and Kuriles. The Cam|chatcans live upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the penin|&s;ula; the Koreki inhabit the northern parts, and round the ea&s;tern ocean, almo&s;t to Anadir; and the Kuriles inhabit the i&s;lands in the ea&s;tern &s;ea, reaching as far as tho&s;e of Japan.</P>
<P>They are of &s;mall &s;tature, &s;warthy, have black hair, broad faces, &s;harp no&s;es, with the eyes falling in, eye-brows &s;mall and thin, hang|ing bellies, and &s;lender legs and arms. They are notorious cowards, great boa&s;ters, and are remarkable for their &s;lavi&s;hne&s;s to people who u&s;e them hardly, and for their ob&s;tinacy and contempt of tho&s;e who treat them with gentle|ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR cloaths are chiefly made of &s;kins of deer, dogs, &s;everal &s;ea and land animals, and even the &s;kins of birds, tho&s;e of different animals being frequently joined in the &s;ame garment. Their upper garment is made after two fa&s;hions, &s;ometimes cutting the &s;kirts all of an equal length, and &s;ometimes leaving them long behind, in form of a train, with wide &s;leeves, long enough to reach down below the knee, and a hood or caul behind, which, in bad weather, they put over their heads below their caps: the opening above is merely large enough to let their heads pa&s;s, and round this opening they &s;ew the &s;kins of dogs feet, with which they cover their faces in cold, &s;tormy weather. Round their &s;kirts and &s;leeves they put a border of white dog's &s;kin; and upon their backs they &s;ew the &s;mall &s;hreds of &s;kins of dif|ferent colours. They commonly wear two coats; the under coat with the hair &s;ide inwards, the other &s;ide being dyed with alder; and the upper with the hair outwards. For the upper garment they choo&s;e black, white, or &s;peckled &s;kins, the hair of which is mo&s;t e&s;teemed for the beauty of its colours.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="265">Men and women, without di&s;tinction, wear the above-mentioned garments, their dre&s;s only differing in their under cloathing, and in the covering of their feet and legs. The women have an under garment, which they commonly wear at home, con&s;i&s;ting of a breeches and wai&s;tcoat &s;ewed together. The breeches are wide, like tho&s;e of the Dutch &s;kippers, and tie below the knee; the wai&s;tcoat is wide above, and drawn round with a &s;tring. Their &s;um|mer habits are made of dre&s;&s;ed &s;kins, without hair, their winter ones of deer, or &s;tone ram &s;kins, with the hair on. The undre&s;s, or hou&s;e|hold habit of the men, is a girdle of leather, with a bag before, and a leather apron to cover them behind: the&s;e girdles are &s;ewed with hair of different colours. They u&s;ed frequently to go a hunting and fi&s;hing, during the &s;ummer, in this dre&s;s; but the fa&s;hion being now changed, they wear linen &s;hirts, which they buy of the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>The covering of their feet and legs is made of &s;kins of different &s;orts. In the &s;ummer time, during the rains, they wear the &s;kins of &s;eals, with the hair outwards; but the mo&s;t common covering is the &s;kin of the legs of the rein deer, and &s;ometimes of the legs of other bea&s;ts, the
<PB N="258" REF="266">&s;haggie&s;t they can find, to pre&s;erve them again&s;t the cold. But the bu&s;kins which both the Co&s;&s;acs and Camchatcans u&s;e in their fine&s;t dre&s;s, are made in the following manner: The &s;ole is a white &s;eal-&s;kin, the upper part of fine white leather, and the hind quarters of white dog|&s;kin: what comes round the legs is of dre&s;&s;ed leather, or dyed &s;eal-&s;kin; the upper parts are embroidered. The&s;e bu&s;kins are looked upon &s;o extraordinary, that if a batchelor wears them, he is immediately concluded to be dre&s;&s;ed for courting.</P>
<P>They wear the &s;ame &s;ort of caps as the people of Jakut&s;ki. In &s;ummer, they tie about their heads a kind of hat, made of birch bark; and the Kuriles, in hot weather, wear caps of platted gra&s;s; but at pre&s;ent, round the Ru&s;s &s;ettle|ments, the fa&s;hion is changed, the women wear|ing &s;hifts, ruffles, wai&s;tcoats, caps and ribbands. The women do all their work in mittins. For|merly they never wa&s;hed their faces, but now they u&s;e both red and white paint. Rotten wood &s;erves them for white paint, and a &s;ea-plant for red, which they boil in &s;eal's fat, and rub their cheeks with, till they are very red. They dre&s;s mo&s;t in winter, e&s;pecially when they either receive or pay vi&s;its.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="267">The common cloaths for a Camchatcan and his family, will not co&s;t him le&s;s than a hun|dred rubles, &s;o dear is every article of dre&s;s.

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Food.</HEAD>
<P>THE Camchatcans divide their fi&s;h into &s;ix parts; the &s;ides and tail are hung up to dry; the back and thinner part of the belly are prepared apart, and generally dried over the fire; the head is laid to &s;our in pits, and is then eaten like &s;alt fi&s;h, and is much e&s;teemed, though it &s;tinks intolerably; the ribs and fle&s;h upon them are hung up and dried, and then pounded for u&s;e: the larger bones are dried and given to the dogs.</P>
<P>Their &s;econd favorite food is <HI>caviar,</HI> or the roes of fi&s;h, which they prepare three different
<PB N="260" REF="268">ways. They dry the roe whole, in the air, or take it out of the &s;kin, which envelopes it, and, &s;preading it upon a bed of gra&s;s, dry it before the fire; or make rolls of it with the leaves of gra&s;s, which they al&s;o dry. They never take a journey, or go a hunting, without dry caviar; and if a Camchatcan has a pound of this, he can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without any other provi&s;ion a great while; for every birch and alder tree furni&s;hes him with bark, which, with his dried caviar, makes him an agreeable meal; but they cannot eat either &s;eparately; for the caviar &s;ticks to the teeth like glue; and it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;wallow the bark by it&s;elf, chew it ever &s;o long. There is &s;till a fourth method, which both the Camchatcans and Koreki u&s;e in preparing their caviar; the fir&s;t, having covered the bottom of a pit with gra&s;s, throw the fre&s;h roes into it, and leave them till they are &s;our; the Koreki tie theirs in bags, and leave them to &s;our: this is e&s;teemed their mo&s;t delicate di&s;h.</P>
<P>There is a third &s;ort of diet, called by the Chamchatcans <HI>Chupriki,</HI> which is thus prepared: In their huts, over the fire-place, they make a bridge of &s;takes, on which they lay a heap of fi&s;h, which remains there till the hut becomes as warm as a bagnio. If there is no great thick|ne&s;s
<PB N="261" REF="269">of fi&s;h, one fire &s;erves to dre&s;s it, but &s;ometimes they are obliged to make two, three, or more fires. Fi&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed in this manner, is half roa&s;ted, and half &s;moaked, but has a very agreeable ta&s;te, and may be reckoned the be&s;t of all the Camchatcan cookery; for the whole juice and fat is prepared with a gradual heat, and kept in by the &s;kin, from which they may, when done enough, be ea&s;ily &s;eparated; and, as &s;oon as it is thus dre&s;&s;ed, they take out the guts and &s;pread the body upon a mat to dry; this they afterwards break &s;mall, and, putting into bags, carry it with them for provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>They have another di&s;h, much e&s;teemed, which they call <HI>Huigul:</HI> it is fi&s;h laid to grow &s;our in pits; and, though the &s;mell of it is in|tolerable, yet the Camchatcans e&s;teem it a per|fume. This fi&s;h &s;ometimes rots &s;o much in the pits, that it cannot be taken out but with ladles; in this ca&s;e, indeed, they give it to their dogs.</P>
<P>As for the fle&s;h of land, and the larger &s;ea|animals, they boil it in their troughs, with &s;e|veral different herbs and roots: the broth they drink out of ladles and bowls, and the meat they take out upon boards, and eat in their hands.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="270">There is a principal di&s;h at all their fea&s;ts, called <HI>Selaga,</HI> made by pounding all &s;orts of roots and berries together, with the addition of caviar and whale's and &s;eal's fat.</P>
<P>Before the conque&s;t by the Ru&s;&s;ians, they &s;eldom drank any thing but plain water, except when they made merry, at which time they drank water, which had &s;tood &s;ome time upon mu&s;hrooms. Now they drink &s;pirits as fa&s;t as the Ru&s;&s;ians. After dinner, they drink water, and at night &s;et a ve&s;&s;el of water by the bed-&s;ide, with the addition of &s;now or ice to keep it cool, and always drink it up before morning. In the winter time, they amu&s;e them&s;elves frequently by throwing handfuls of &s;now into their mouths; and the bridegrooms, who work with the fa|thers of their future brides, find it their harde&s;t ta&s;k to provide &s;now for the family in &s;ummer time; for they mu&s;t bring it from the highe&s;t hills, be the weather what it will, or they never would be forgiven.</P>

<HEAD>Habitations.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the name of <HI>O&s;trog,</HI> is under&s;tood every habitation, con&s;i&s;ting of one or more huts, all &s;urrounded by an earthen wall or pali&s;adoe.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="271">Their huts are built in the following manner: They dig a hole in the earth, about five feet deep, the breadth and length proportioned to the number of people de&s;igned to live in it. In the middle of this hole, they &s;et up four thick, wooden pillars; over the&s;e they lay balks, upon which they form the roof or cieling, leaving in the middle a &s;quare opening, which &s;erves them for a window and chimney: this done, they cover the building with gra&s;s and earth, &s;o that it re&s;embles a round hillock without, but within it is an oblong &s;quare, with the fire-place in one of the long &s;ides: between the pillars, round the walls of their huts, they make benches, upon which each of the family lies &s;eparately; but, on that &s;ide oppo&s;ite the fire, there are no benches, being left for their kitchen furniture. In the&s;e huts, where there are no benches, there are balks laid upon the floor, and covered with mats. They adorn the walls within with gra&s;s mats.</P>
<P>The&s;e huts are entered by ladders, commonly placed near the fire-hearth; &s;o that when they are heating their huts, the &s;teps of the ladder become &s;o hot, and the &s;moke &s;o thick, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;tranger to go up or down without being burnt or &s;tifled to death;
<PB N="264" REF="272">yet the natives find no difficulty in it; and though they can only fix their toes on the &s;teps of the ladder, they mount like &s;quirrels; nor do the women he&s;itate to go through this &s;moke, with the children upon their &s;houlders, though there is another opening, through which the women are allowed to pa&s;s; but if any <HI>man</HI> &s;hould pretend to do the &s;ame, he would be laughed at. The Camchatcans live in the&s;e huts all the winter, after which they go into others, which they call <HI>Balagans.</HI> The&s;e &s;erve them not only to live in during the &s;ummer, but al&s;o for magazines. The balagans are built in the following manner: Nine pillars, about two &s;athom long or more, are fixed in the ground, and bound together with balks laid over them, which they cover with rods, and over all lay gra&s;s, fa&s;tening &s;pars, and a round &s;harp roof at top, which they cover with bramble, and thatch with gra&s;s. They fa&s;ten the lower ends or the &s;pars to the balks with ropes and thongs, and have a door on each &s;ide, one directly oppo&s;ite to the other. They make u&s;e of the &s;ame kind of huts to keep their fi&s;h, &amp;c. till winter comes on, when they can more ea&s;ily remove it; and this without any guard, only taking away the ladders. If the&s;e buildings were
<PB N="265" REF="273">not &s;o high, the wild bea&s;ts would undoubtedly plunder them; for, notwith&s;tanding all their precaution, the bears &s;ometimes climb up and force their way into their magazines, e&s;pecially in harve&s;t time, when fi&s;h and berries begin to grow &s;carce.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern Camchatcans commonly build their villages in thick woods and other places, which are naturally &s;trong, not le&s;s than twenty ver&s;ts from the &s;ea; and their &s;ummer habita|tions are near the mouths of the rivers; but tho&s;e who live upon the Penchin&s;ka &s;ea, and the ea&s;tern ocean, build their villages very near the &s;hore. They look upon that river, near which their village is &s;ituated, as the inheritance of their tribe.</P>

<HEAD>Furniture, Uten&s;ils, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the ar|rival of the Ru&s;&s;ians, the Camchatcans u&s;ed &s;tones and bones in&s;tead of metals, out of which they made their hatchets, &s;pears, arrows, needles and lances. Hatchets were made of the bones of whales and rein deer, and &s;ometimes of agate and flint: they were &s;haped like a wedge, and fa&s;tened to crooked handles. With the&s;e they hollowed out their canoes, bowls, di&s;hes and troughs; which,
<PB N="266" REF="274">with cans of birch-bark, con&s;tituted the whole of their furniture; but with &s;o much ex|pence of trouble and time, that a canoe would be three years in making, and a large bowl one year. On this account, a large canoe or trough was in as great e&s;timation among them as a ve&s;&s;el of the mo&s;t precious metal and fine&s;t workman&s;hip is with us; and the village in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a canoe or trough, valued it&s;elf extremely upon it. In the&s;e bowls they dre&s;s their victuals and heat their broth, by throwing red-hot &s;tones into it.</P>
<P>Their knives were made of a greeni&s;h moun|tain cry&s;tal, &s;harp pointed, and &s;haped like a lancet, which was &s;tuck into a wooden handle. Of &s;uch cry&s;tals were likewi&s;e made their ar|rows, &s;pears, and lancets with which they &s;till continue to let blood. Needles they formed of the bones of &s;ables, with which they not only &s;ewed their cloaths together, but made al&s;o very curious embroidery.</P>
<P>To procure fire, they u&s;e a board of dry wood, with round holes in its &s;ides, and a &s;mall round &s;tick; this they rub in a hole till it takes fire, making u&s;e of dry gra&s;s, beaten &s;oft, by way of tinder. The&s;e in&s;truments are held in &s;uch e&s;teem by the Camchatcans, that they are
<PB N="267" REF="275">never without them, and they value them more than our &s;teels and flints: they are, however, exceedingly fond of other iron in&s;truments, &s;uch as hatchets, knives or needles; nay, at the fir&s;t arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians, a piece of broken iron was looked upon as a great pre&s;ent, and even now they receive it with thankfulne&s;s, finding u&s;e for the lea&s;t fragment, either to point their arrows or make darts, which they do by hammering it out cold between two &s;tones. As &s;ome of them delight in war, the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants are forbidden to &s;ell them any war|like in&s;truments; but they are ingenious enough to make &s;pears and arrows out of the iron pots and kettles, which they buy; and they are &s;o dextrous, when the eye of a needle breaks, as to make a new one, which they will repeat un|til nothing remains but the point.</P>

<HEAD>Boats.</HEAD>
<P>THE Camchatcans make their boats of poplar wood; but the Kuriles not having any wood of their own, make u&s;e of what is thrown on &s;hore by the &s;ea, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to come from the coa&s;ts of Japan, China or America. The northern inhabitants of Camchatca, the &s;ettled Koreki and Chukor&s;|koi, for want of proper timber and plank,
<PB N="268" REF="276">make their boats of the &s;kins of &s;ea animals. They &s;ew the pieces together with whales beards, and caulk them with mo&s;s or nettles beaten &s;mall.</P>
<P>The&s;e boats hold two per&s;ons, one of which &s;its in the prow, and the other in the &s;tern. They pu&s;h them again&s;t the &s;tream with poles, which is attended with great trouble: when the current is &s;trong, they can &s;carely ad|vance two feet in ten minutes; notwith&s;tanding which, they will carry the&s;e boats, full loaded, twenty ver&s;ts, and, when the &s;tream is not very &s;trong, even thirty or forty ver&s;ts.</P>
<P>The larger boats carry thirty or forty pood. When the goods are not very heavy, they lay them upon a float or bridge, re&s;ting upon two boats joined together. They u&s;e this method of conveying their provi&s;ions down the &s;tream, and al&s;o to and from the i&s;lands.</P>

<HEAD>Employments, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;ummer time the men are employed in catching, drying, and carrying fi&s;h to their hou&s;es, in preparing bones and &s;our fi&s;h to feed their dogs: the women, in cleaning the fi&s;h and &s;preading it out to dry; &s;ometimes they go a fi&s;hing with their hu&s;bands. When fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on is over,
<PB N="269" REF="277">they gather in the herbs, roots and berries both for food and medicine.</P>
<P>In harve&s;t, men catch the fi&s;h that appear at that time and kill fowl, &s;uch as gee&s;e, ducks, &s;wans, and the like; teach their dogs to draw carriages, and prepare wood for their &s;ledges and other u&s;es. The women at this time are bu&s;y in pulling up nettles, of which they make their thread; watering, breaking, and peeling them, and laying the hemp of them up in their balagans.</P>
<P>In winter, the men hunt for &s;ables and foxes, weave fi&s;hing-nets, make &s;ledges, fetch wood, and bring home the provi&s;ions which they had prepared in the &s;ummer and could not bring home in harve&s;t. The women at this time are principally employed in &s;preading threads for nets.</P>
<P>In &s;pring, when the rivers begin to thaw, and the fi&s;h which there wintered go towards the &s;ea, the men are bu&s;ied in catching them and the amphibious animals that at this time fre|quent the bays. The people on the ea&s;tern &s;hore catch the &s;ea-beaver. All the women go into the fields, where they gather wild garlick and other young herbs, which they u&s;e not only in a &s;carcity of other provi&s;ion, which often hap|pens
<PB N="270" REF="278">at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, but likewi&s;e out of luxury; for &s;o fond are they of every thing that is green, that, during the whole &s;pring, they are &s;eldom without having &s;ome of it in their mouths; and though they always, bring home a great bundle of greens, it &s;eldom la&s;ts them above a day.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above-mentioned employments, the men are obliged to build their huts and ba|lagans, to heat their huts, dre&s;s victuals, feed their dogs, flay the animals, who&s;e &s;kins are u&s;ed in cloathing, and provide all hou&s;ehold and warlike in&s;truments. The women are the only taylors and &s;hoemakers; for they dre&s;s the &s;kins, make the cloaths, &s;hoes and &s;tockings: it is even a di&s;grace for the men to do any thing of that &s;ort; &s;o that they looked upon the Ru&s;&s;ians who came here fir&s;t, in a very ridi|culous light, when they &s;aw them u&s;e the needle or the awl. The women are likewi&s;e employed in dying &s;kins, in conjuration and curing the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Their method of preparing and dying &s;kins, &s;ewing and joining them is as follows: Skins which they u&s;e for cloaths, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the deer, &s;eal, dog, and beaver, they prepare in the following manner: Fir&s;t they wet and &s;pread
<PB N="271" REF="279">them out, &s;crape of all the pieces of fat or veins that remain after flaying, with &s;tones fixed in pieces of wood; then rubbing it over with fre&s;h or &s;our caviar, they roll it up and tread it with their feet till the hide begins to &s;tink; they again &s;crape and clean it, and continue this till the &s;kin is &s;oft and clean. Such &s;kins as they want to prepare without the hair, they u&s;e at fir&s;t in the &s;ame manner as above; then hang them in the &s;moke for a week, and afterwards &s;oak them in warm water to take the hair off; at la&s;t rubbing them with caviar, by frequent treading, and &s;craping them with &s;tones, they make them clean and &s;oft.</P>
<P>They dye the deer and dog &s;kins, which they u&s;e for cloathing, with alder bark cut and rub|bed very &s;mall. Seal &s;kins they dye in a more curious manner: Having fir&s;t cleaned off the hair, they make a bag of the &s;kins, and, turning the hair &s;ide outwards, they pour into it a &s;trong decoction of alder bark: after it has lain thus &s;ome time, they hang it upon a tree and beat it with a &s;tick. This operation they repeat till the colour is gone quite through the &s;kin; then they rip it open, and, &s;tretching it out, dry it in the air: at la&s;t they rub it till it becomes &s;oft and fit for u&s;e. Such &s;kins are not unlike
<PB N="272" REF="280">dre&s;&s;ed goat &s;kins. They call them <HI>Mendari,</HI> and are worth about three &s;hillings each. The hair of the &s;eals, with which they ornament their cloaths and &s;hoes, is dyed with the juice of the red wortleberry boiled with alder bark, allum, and lac lunae, which makes a very bright colour. They u&s;ed to &s;ew their cloaths and &s;hoes with needles made of bone, and in&s;tead of thread they made u&s;e of the fibres of the deer, &s;plit to the &s;ize or thinne&s;s re|quired.</P>
<P>They make glue of the dried &s;kins of fi&s;hes, and particularly of the whale-&s;kin. A piece of this they wrap up in birch bark, and lay it for a little while in warm a&s;hes, when it becomes fit for u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Method of Travelling, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE dogs of Camchatca dif|fer very little from our common hou&s;e-dogs: they are of a middling &s;ize, and of various co|lours, though there &s;eem to be more white, black, and grey than of any other. In travel|ling they make u&s;e of tho&s;e that are ca&s;trated, and generally yoke four to a &s;ledge.</P>
<P>They drive and direct their dogs with a crook|ed &s;tick, about four feet long, which they &s;ome|times
<PB N="273" REF="281">adorn with different-coloured thongs: this is looked upon as a great piece of finery. They drive their &s;ledges, &s;itting on the right &s;ide, with their feet hanging down; for it would be con&s;idered as a di&s;grace to a man to &s;it down in the bottom of the &s;ledge, or to have a per&s;on to drive him; no one doing this but the women.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to travel in the&s;e &s;ledges; for, unle&s;s a man keeps the exacte&s;t balance, he is liable every moment, from their height and narrowne&s;s, to be overturned: in a rugged road, this would be very dangerous, as the dogs never &s;top till they come to &s;ome hou&s;e, or are en|tangled by &s;omething on the road, e&s;pecially in going down &s;teep hills, when they run with all their force, and are &s;carcely to be kept in; for which rea&s;on, in de&s;cending any great declivity, they unyoke all the dogs except one, and lead them gently down. They likewi&s;e walk up hill; for it is as much as the dogs can do to draw up the empty &s;ledges. After a deep &s;now, before it has been hardened by a fro&s;t, there is no travelling with dogs until a road be made, which is done by a man's going before with &s;now-&s;hoes, whom they call <HI>Brodov&s;hika.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="282">The&s;e &s;now-&s;hoes are made of two thin boards, &s;eparated in the middle, bound together at the ends, and with the fore-part bent a little up|wards. The <HI>Brodov&s;hika</HI> having one upon each foot, leaves the dogs and &s;ledge, and, going on, clears the road for &s;ome way; then returning, leads forward the dogs and &s;ledge &s;o far as the road is made; a method which he mu&s;t continue till he comes to &s;ome dwelling|hou&s;e. This is very laborious, and it happens &s;o often, that no driver ever &s;ets out without his &s;now-&s;hoes.</P>
<P>When a &s;torm of driven-&s;now &s;urprizes them, they are obliged with all ha&s;te to &s;eek the &s;helter of &s;ome wood, and &s;tay there as long as the tempe&s;t la&s;ts, which &s;ometimes is a whole week. If they are a large company, they dig a place for them&s;elves under the &s;now, and cover the entry with wood or brambles. Sometimes they hide them&s;elves in caves or holes in the earth, wrapping them&s;elves up in their furs; and, when thus covered, they move and turn them&s;elves with the greate&s;t caution, lea&s;t they &s;hould throw off the &s;now, for under that they lie as warm as in their common huts: they only require a breathing place, but their cloaths mu&s;t not be
<PB N="275" REF="283">tight or hard girt about them, for then the cold is un&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>Another danger attending travellers is, that, in the &s;evere&s;t fro&s;t, &s;everal rivers are not quite frozen over; and, as the roads, for the mo&s;t part, lie clo&s;e upon the rivers, the banks being very &s;teep, &s;carce a year pa&s;&s;es without many being drowned. A di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance al&s;o to tho&s;e who travel in the&s;e parts, is, their &s;ometimes being obliged to pa&s;s through coppices, where they run the ri&s;k of having their eyes &s;cratched out or their limbs broken; for the dogs always run mo&s;t violently in the wor&s;t roads, and, to free them&s;elves, very often over|turn their driver.</P>
<P>The be&s;t travelling is in the month of March or April, when the &s;now is become hard, or frozen a little at top; however, there is &s;till this in|convenience attending it, that &s;ometimes tra|vellers are obliged to lodge two or three nights in de&s;art places; and it is difficult to prevail upon the Camchatcans to make a fire, either for warming them&s;elves or dre&s;&s;ing their victuals, as they and their dogs eat dried fi&s;h, and find them&s;elves &s;o warm, wrapped up in their furs, that they want none; nay, all the people of this climate bear cold &s;o well, that they &s;leep
<PB N="276" REF="284">in the open air, as &s;ound as others in a warm bed, and awake next morning perfectly refre&s;h|ed and alert. This &s;eems to be &s;o natural to all here, that &s;ome of them have been &s;een to lie down with their backs uncovered again&s;t a fire; and, notwith&s;tanding the fire has been burnt out long before morning, they continued to &s;leep on very comfortably, and without any inconvenience.</P>

<HEAD>Manner of War.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH before the Ru&s;&s;ian conque&s;t, the Cam|chatcans did not &s;eem to have had any ambition of encrea&s;ing their power, or enlarging their terri|tories, yet they had &s;uch frequent quarrels among them&s;elves, that &s;eldom a year pa&s;&s;ed without one village or other being entirely ruin|ed. The de&s;ign of their wars was to make pri|&s;oners, in order to employ them, if males, in their harde&s;t labour; or, if females, to make wives or concubines of them; and &s;ometimes the neighbouring villages went to war for quar|rels that happened among the children, or for neglecting to invite each other to their enter|tainments.</P>
<P>Their wars are carried on more by &s;tratagem than bravery; for they are &s;uch cowards, that
<PB N="277" REF="285">they will not openly attack any one, unle&s;s forced by nece&s;&s;ity: this is the more extraordi|nary, as no people &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e life more than they do, &s;elf-murder being here very frequent. Their manner of attacking is this: In the night time they &s;teal into the enemy's village and &s;ur|prize them, which may ea&s;ily be done, as they keep no watch; thus a &s;mall party may de&s;troy a large village, as they have nothing more to do than to &s;ecure the mouth of a hut, and &s;uffer no body to come out, which one only can do at a time; whoever, therefore, fir&s;t attempts to e&s;|cape, is knocked down, or obliged to &s;ubmit to be bound.</P>
<P>The male pri&s;oners which they take, e&s;peci|ally if they are men of any con&s;equence, are treated with all manner of barbarity, &s;uch as hewing them to pieces, tearing out their bowels when alive, and hanging them up by the feet. This has been the fate of &s;everal Ru&s;&s;ian Co&s;&s;acs, during the di&s;turbances of Camchatca, and their barbarities are exerci&s;ed with great &s;how of tri|umph and rejoicing.</P>
<P>The private differences among them&s;elves were very u&s;eful to the Co&s;&s;acs, in their con|que&s;t of the nation; for, when the natives &s;aw the latter attacking one village, they were &s;o
<PB N="278" REF="286">far from a&s;&s;i&s;ting their countrymen, that they rejoiced at their de&s;truction, not con&s;idering that the &s;ame was to be their fate next.</P>
<P>In their wars with the Co&s;&s;acs, they de&s;troyed more by &s;tratagem than by arms; for, when the Co&s;&s;acs came to any village to demand its tribute, they were received with all marks of friend&s;hip, and not only the tribute was paid, but likewi&s;e great pre&s;ents were made them. Thus the natives having lulled them into a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, they either cut their throats in the night time, or &s;et fire to their huts, and burnt them, with all the Co&s;&s;acs which were within. By &s;uch &s;tratagems, &s;eventy people were de&s;troyed in two places, which, con&s;ider|ing the &s;mall number of Co&s;&s;acs that were there, was a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s; nay, it has &s;ome|times happened, that when they had no oppor|tunity of immediately de&s;troying the Co&s;&s;acs, they have for two years quietly paid the tribute, waiting till they could find an opportunity of doing it. But now the Co&s;&s;acs are more upon their guard, and are particularly afraid of ex|traordinary care&s;&s;es, and always expect &s;ome bad intention, when the women, in the night time, retire from their huts. When the Cam|chatcans pretend to have dreamed of dead
<PB N="279" REF="287">people, or go to di&s;tant villages, there is rea&s;on to dread a general in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>When this happens, they kill all the Co&s;&s;acs which fall in their way, and even the Camchat|cans who will not join in the rebellion. As &s;oon as they hear that troops are coming a|gain&s;t them, in&s;tead of going to oppo&s;e their enemies, they retire to &s;ome high place, which they fortify as &s;trongly as they can, and, build|ing huts there, wait till they are attacked, when they bravely defend them&s;elves with their bows and arrows, and every other method they can think of; but if they ob&s;erve that the enemy is likely to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the fort|re&s;s, they fir&s;t cut the throats of their wives and children, and afterwards either throw them&s;elves down the precipice, or with their arms ru&s;h in upon their enemies, that they may not die unrevenged; this they call 'Making a bed for them&s;elves.' In the year 1740, the rebels threw them&s;elves from a very high hill, upon which they were fortified, into the &s;ea, after murder|ing all their women and children, except a girl, whom they mi&s;&s;ed in their hurry. Notwith|&s;tanding this re&s;olutene&s;s, from the time that Camchatca was &s;ubdued, there have been but
<PB N="280" REF="288">two rebellions which could properly be call|ed &s;o.</P>
<P>Their arms are, bows and arrows, &s;pears, and a coat of mail: their quivers are made of the wood of the larch-tree, glued round with birch|bark: their bow-&s;trings of the blood ve&s;&s;els of the whale, and their arrows are commonly about four feet long, pointed with flint-&s;tones or bone; and though they are but indifferent, yet they are very dangerous, being all poi&s;oned; &s;o that a per&s;on wounded by them generally dies in twenty-four hours, unle&s;s the poi&s;on be &s;ucked out, which is the only remedy known. Their &s;pears are likewi&s;e pointed with flint or bone. Their coats of mail are made of mats, or of the &s;kins of &s;eals or &s;ea-hor&s;es, which they cut into thongs and plait together. They wear them on the left &s;ide, tying them with thongs upon the right: behind is fixed a high board to defend their heads, and another before to guard the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>It is remarkable when they march, two never go abrea&s;t, but follow one another in the &s;ame path, which, by u&s;e, becomes very deep and narrow; &s;o that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for one that is not u&s;ed to it to walk therein; for the&s;e

<HEAD>Trade.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR trade is almo&s;t entirely confined to procuring the immediate nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life.

Their dome&s;tic trade con&s;i&s;ts in dogs, boats, di&s;hes, troughs, nets, hemp, yarn, and provi|&s;ions, and this kind of barter is carried on un|der a great &s;how of friend&s;hip; for when one wants any thing that another has, he goes freely to vi&s;it him, and, without any ceremony, makes known his wants, although perhaps he never had any acquaintance with him before: the ho&s;t is obliged to behave according to the cu&s;tom of the country, and gives his gue&s;t what he has occa&s;ion for: but he may after|wards return the vi&s;it, and mu&s;t be received in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<HEAD>Government, Laws, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the Ru&s;&s;ian conque&s;t, they lived in perfect freedom, having no chief, being &s;ubject to no law, nor paying any taxes;
<PB N="282" REF="290">the old men, or tho&s;e who were remarkable for their bravery, bearing the principal authority in their villages, though none had right to com|mand or inflict puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>If any one kills another, he is to be killed by the relations of the per&s;on &s;lain. They burn the hands of tho&s;e who are frequently caught in theft; but, for the fir&s;t offence, the thief mu&s;t re&s;tore what he hath &s;tolen, and live alone, in &s;olitude, without expecting any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from others. They never have any di&s;putes about their land or their huts, every one having land and water more than &s;ufficient for his wants.</P>
<P>But in every O&s;trog, or large village, now, by order of her Imperial Maje&s;ty, is appointed a chief, who is &s;ole judge in all cau&s;es, except tho&s;e of life and death.</P>
<P>They think them&s;elves, however, the hap|pie&s;t people in the world, and look upon the Ru&s;&s;ians, who are &s;ettled among them, with contempt. But this notion begins to change; for the old people, who are confirmed in their cu&s;toms, drop off, and the young ones, being converted to Chri&s;tianity, adopt the cu&s;toms of the Ru&s;&s;ians, and de&s;pi&s;e the barbarity and &s;u|per&s;tition of their ance&s;tors.</P>

<HEAD>Religion, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Camchatcans, like other barbarous nations, have no notions of a Deity, but what are ab&s;urd, ri|diculous and &s;hocking, to a humani&s;ed mind. They call their God <HI>Kutchu,</HI> but they pay him no religious wor&s;hip; and the only u&s;e they make of his name is, to divert them&s;elves with it: they relate &s;uch &s;candalous &s;tories of him, as one would be a&s;hamed to repeat. Among&s;t other things, they reproach him with having made &s;o many &s;teep hills, &s;o many &s;mall and rapid rivers, &s;o much rain, and &s;o many &s;torms; and, in all the troubles that happen to them, upbraid and bla&s;pheme him. They, however, celebrate always three days in the month of November, hence called the Month of Purifica|tion, after their &s;ummer or harve&s;t labour is over: they look upon it as a &s;in to do any work, or make any vi&s;its, before the&s;e holidays, the breach of which they never &s;uffer to pa&s;s with|out expiation. From hence we may &s;ee, that the ance&s;tors of the&s;e people were accu&s;tomed to offer up the fir&s;t-fruits of their &s;ummer la|bours to God, and at the &s;ame time make merry with one another. Their ceremonies, in the
<PB N="284" REF="292">celebration of their holidays, are extremely &s;illy, and con&s;i&s;t of many ridiculous antics.</P>
<P>They place a pillar upon a large, wide plain, which they bind round with rags. Whenever they pa&s;s this pillar, they throw a piece of fi&s;h or &s;ome other victuals to it; and near it they never gather any berries or kill any bea&s;ts or birds. This offering they think pre&s;erves their lives, which otherwi&s;e would be &s;hortened: however, they offer nothing which can be of u&s;e to them&s;elves, but only the fins and tails of fi&s;h, or &s;uch things as they would be obliged to throw away. In this all the people of A&s;ia agree, offering only &s;uch things as are u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves. Be&s;ides the&s;e pillars, &s;everal other places are reckoned &s;acred, &s;uch as burning and &s;moaking mountains, hot &s;prings, and &s;ome particular woods, which they imagine are in|habited by devils. The world, they believe, is eternal, and the &s;oul immortal, and that it &s;hall be again joined to the body, and live eternally, &s;ubject to fatigues and troubles, as in this pre|&s;ent life, with this difference only, that they &s;hall have greater plenty of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life: even the very &s;malle&s;t animal they ima|gine will ri&s;e again and dwell under the earth.

<PB N="285" REF="293">there is a firmament like ours, and under that firmament another earth, in which when we have &s;ummer, they have winter, and when we have winter, they have &s;ummer. With regard to future rewards and puni&s;hments, they be|lieve that, in the other world, the rich will be poor, and the poor rich.</P>
<P>Their notions of vice and virtue are equally extravagant. They believe every thing lawful that procures them the &s;atisfaction of their wi&s;hes and pa&s;&s;ions; and think that only to be &s;in, from which they apprehend danger or ruin; &s;o that they neither reckon murder, &s;elf-murder, adultery, oppre&s;&s;ion, nor the like, any wicked|ne&s;s: on the contrary, they look upon it to be a mortal &s;in to &s;ave any one that is drowning; becau&s;e, according to their notions, whoever &s;aves him will be &s;oon drowned him&s;elf. They account it, likewi&s;e, a &s;in to bathe in, or drink, hot water, or to go up to the burning moun|tains. They have, be&s;ides the&s;e, innumerable ab&s;urd cu&s;toms, &s;uch as &s;craping the &s;now from their feet with a knife, or whetting their hatchets upon the road. This may, however, be &s;aid, that they are not the only people who have ri|diculous &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="294">Be&s;ides the above-mentioned gods, they pay a religious regard to &s;everal animals, from which they apprehend danger. They offer fire at the holes of &s;ables and foxes: when fi&s;hing, they intreat the whales or &s;ea-hor&s;es not to overturn their boats; and in hunting, be&s;eech the bears and wolves not to hurt them.</P>
<P>They fill almo&s;t every place in Heaven and earth with different &s;pirits, and offer them &s;a|crifices upon every occa&s;ion. Some carry little idols about them, or have them placed in their dwellings; but with regard to God, they not only neglect to wor&s;hip him, but, in ca&s;e of troubles and misfortunes, they cur&s;e and bla&s;|pheme him.</P>
<P>Every old woman is looked upon as a witch, and an interpreter of dreams, and there are per|&s;ons who pretend to conjure. In their conjura|tions, they whi&s;per upon the fins of fi&s;h and &s;ome other things; by which means they think they cure di&s;ea&s;es, divert misfortunes, and fore|tel futurity. They are, in general, great ob|&s;ervers of dreams, which they relate to one an|other as &s;oon as they awake in the morning, judging from thence of their future good or bad fortune; and &s;ome of the&s;e dreams have their interpretation fixed and &s;ettled. Be&s;ides this,
<PB N="287" REF="295">they pretend to chiromancy, and to foretel a man's good or bad fortune, by the lines of his hand; but the rules which they follow are kept a great &s;ecret.</P>
<P>All this ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, however, will &s;oon be rooted out from among&s;t them; chapels of wor&s;hip being built in almo&s;t every village, and &s;chools erected, to which the Cam|chatcans &s;end their children with great plea|&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>Court&s;hips, Marriages, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a Cam|chatcan re&s;olves to marry, he looks about for a bride in &s;ome of the neighbouring villages, &s;eldom in his own; and when he finds one to his mind, he di&s;co|vers his inclination to the parents, de&s;iring that he may have the liberty of &s;erving them for &s;ome time: this permi&s;&s;ion he ea&s;ily obtains, and, during his &s;ervice, he &s;hews an uncommon zeal to &s;atisfy them in whatever he does. The time of his &s;ervice expired, he de&s;ires liberty to &s;eize his bride; and, if he has happened to plea&s;e the parents, his bride, and her relations, his reque&s;t is pre&s;ently granted; but if they di&s;ap|prove of it, they di&s;mi&s;s him with &s;ome &s;mall reward for his &s;ervices. It &s;ometimes happens,
<PB N="288" REF="296">that the&s;e bridegrooms, without di&s;covering any thing of their intention, engage them&s;elves in &s;ervice in &s;ome di&s;tant village; and though every one &s;u&s;pects their de&s;ign, yet no notice is taken of it till they declare it.</P>
<P>When a bridegroom obtains the liberty of &s;eizing his bride, he &s;eeks every opportunity of finding her alone, or in the company of but a few people; for, during this time, all the wo|men in the village are obliged to protect her: be&s;ides, &s;he has two or three different coats, and is &s;o &s;wathed round with fi&s;h-nets and &s;traps, that &s;he has &s;carce more motion than a &s;tatue. If the bridegroom happens to find her alone, or with few in company, he throws him&s;elf upon her, and begins to tear off her cloaths; for to &s;trip the bride naked, con&s;titutes the ceremony of marriage. This is not always an ea&s;y ta&s;k; for though &s;he her&s;elf makes little re&s;i&s;tance (and, indeed, &s;he can make but little), yet, if there happen to be many women near, they all fall upon the bridegroom, without mercy beating and dragging him by the hair, &s;cratch|ing his face, and u&s;ing every other method they can think of to prevent him from accompli&s;h|ing his de&s;ign. If the bridegroom is &s;o happy as to obtain his wi&s;h, he immediately runs from
<PB N="289" REF="297">her, and the bride, as a proof of her being con|quered, calls him back, with a &s;oft and tender voice, and thus the marriage is concluded. This victory is &s;eldom obtained at once, but &s;ome times the conte&s;t la&s;ts a whole year; and, after every attempt, the bridegroom is obliged to take &s;ome time to recover &s;trength, and to cure the wounds he has received. There is an in&s;tance of one, who, after having per&s;evered for &s;even years, in&s;tead of obtaining his bride, was ren|dered quite a cripple, the women having u&s;ed him very barbarou&s;ly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ceremony is over, he is at liberty next night to go to her bed, and, the day fol|lowing, carries her off to his own village. After &s;ome time, the bride and the bridegroom return to the bride's relations, where the marriage fea&s;t is celebrated in the following manner, of which the writer of this account was an eye witne&s;s, in 1739.</P>
<P>The bridegroom, his friends, and wife, vi&s;ited the father-in-law in three boats. All the women were in the boats, and the men, being naked, pu&s;hed them along with poles. About one hun|dered paces from the village to which they were going, they landed, began to &s;ing, and u&s;ed conjurations with tow fa&s;tened upon a rod, mut|tering
<PB N="290" REF="298">&s;omething over a dried fi&s;h's head, which they wrapped in the tow, and gave to an old woman to hold. The conjuration being over, they put upon the bride a coat of &s;heep's &s;kin, and tied four images about her: thus loaded, &s;he had &s;ome difficulty to move. They then re|turned to their boats and came up to the village, where they landed a &s;econd time; at this land|ing-place a boy of the village met them, and, taking the bride by the hand, led her along, all the women following.</P>
<P>When the bride came to the hut, they tied a &s;trap round her, by which &s;he was let down the &s;tairs, the old woman who carried the fi&s;h's head going before her. This head &s;he laid down at the foot of the &s;tairs, where it was trodden upon by the bride and bridegroom and all the people pre&s;ent, and then thrown into the fire.</P>
<P>All the &s;trangers took their places, having fir&s;t &s;tripped the bride of &s;uperfluous ornaments. The bridegroom heated the hut, and dre&s;&s;ed the victuals which they had brought with them, and entertained the inhabitants of the village. The next day, the ma&s;ter of the hut entertained the &s;trangers with great abundance, who on the third day departed; the bride and bridegroom only remained, to work &s;ome time with their
<PB N="291" REF="299">father. The &s;uperfluous part of the bride's dre&s;s, which was taken from her, was di&s;tributed among the relations, who were obliged to return her pre&s;ents of far greater value.</P>
<P>The&s;e ceremonies only relate to a fir&s;t mar|riage; for in the marriage of a widow, the man and woman's agreement is &s;ufficient; but he mu&s;t not take her to him&s;elf before her fins are taken away. This can only be done by &s;ome &s;tranger lying with her once; but as this taking off of &s;in was looked upon by the Camchatcans as very di&s;honourable for the man, it was for|merly difficult to find one to undertake it, &s;o that the poor widows were at a great lo&s;s before the Ru&s;&s;ians came among&s;t them; &s;ince which they have been in no great want of &s;trangers to take away their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Marriage is forbidden only between father and daughter, mother and &s;on; a &s;on-in-law may marry his mother-in-law, and a father-in-law his daughter-in-law, and fir&s;t cou&s;ins marry fre|quently. Their divorce is very ea&s;y, con&s;i&s;ting only in a man's &s;eparating beds from his wife. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the man immediately marries again, and the woman accepts of another hu&s;|band, without any further ceremony.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="300">A Camchatcan hath two or three wives, with whom he &s;leeps by turns. Sometimes he keeps them all in one hut, and &s;ometimes in different huts. With every maid that he marries, he is obliged to go through the above-mentioned cere|monies. Though the&s;e people are fond of wo|men, yet they are not &s;o jealous as the Koreki. In their marriages they do not &s;eem to regard the marks of virginity. Nor are the women more jealous; for two or three wives live with one hu&s;band in all harmony, even though he &s;hould al&s;o keep &s;everal concubines.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Birth of Children. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN general the&s;e people are not fruit|ful; for it does not appear that any one man has had ten children by the &s;ame woman. Their women, as they &s;ay, have commonly very ea&s;y births; for, in a quarter of an hour afterwards, they will appear abroad about their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, and without any change of countenance. They have no profe&s;&s;ed midwives, and for the mo&s;t part, the mother or neare&s;t relation per|forms the office.</P>
<P>Women who de&s;ire to have children, eat &s;piders for that purpo&s;e. To prevent conception, they u&s;e &s;everal herbs and different conjurations.<PB N="293" REF="301">Some of them are &s;uch unnatural wretches, as to de&s;troy their children when they are born, or throw them alive to the dogs. When a woman bears twins, one of them at lea&s;t mu&s;t be de|&s;troyed, and &s;o mu&s;t a child born in very &s;tormy weather, though the la&s;t can be avoided by &s;ome conjurations. After the birth, the women, to recover their &s;trength, eat fi&s;h broth, made with an herb which they call <HI>hale;</HI> and in a few days return to their ordinary diet.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Di&s;ea&s;es and Remedies.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal di|&s;ea&s;es in Camchatca are, the &s;curvy, boils, pal&s;y, cancer, jaundice, and the venereal di&s;temper. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es they think are inflicted upon them by the &s;pirits that inhabit &s;ome particular groves, if ignorantly they happen to out down any of them. Their chief remedies con&s;i&s;t in charms and conjura|tions, but at the &s;ame time they do not neglect the u&s;e of herbs and roots. For the &s;curvy they u&s;e a certain herb, which they rub upon their gums, as al&s;o the leaves of the cranberry and blackberry. The Ru&s;&s;ians cure them&s;elves with decoctions of the tops of cedar, and by eating wild garlic.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="302">Boils are a mo&s;t dangerous di&s;ea&s;e in Cam|chatca, cau&s;ing the death of numbers. The pal&s;y, cancer, and French di&s;ea&s;e, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be incurable; the la&s;t, they &s;ay, was not heard of before the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians. There is likewi&s;e another di&s;temper which they call the <HI>&s;u&s;hutch,</HI> which is a &s;ort of &s;cab that &s;ur|rounds the whole body under the ribs like a gir|dle. When this does not come to &s;uppurate and fall off, it is mortal; and, they &s;ay, every one mu&s;t have this once in his life-time, as we have the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>When they are bitten by a dog or wolf, they lay the brui&s;ed leaves of the ulmaria upon the wound, drinking, at the &s;ame time, a decoction of them: this decoction they al&s;o admini&s;ter in the belly-ach and &s;curvy. The leaves and &s;talks brui&s;ed they u&s;e in burns. The decoction of this herb, mixed with fi&s;h, they u&s;e al&s;o in the tooth-ach, holding it warm in their mouths, and laying a piece of the root upon the affected tooth. They u&s;e a &s;pecies of gentian in the &s;curvy, and almo&s;t again&s;t every di&s;order.</P>
<P>In the jaundice they have a medicine which they con&s;ider as infallible. They take the roots of the iris &s;ylve&s;tris, and, after cleaning them, beat them in warm water, and u&s;e the juice,
<PB N="295" REF="303">which they &s;queeze out, as a cly&s;ter, continuing it for two days, two or three times a day: this produces a purging, and generally gives great relief. After &s;ome time, if the cure is not com|pleted, they repeat it. They neither u&s;e lancets nor cupping-gla&s;&s;es, but, with a pair of wooden pincers, draw up the &s;kin and pierce it with an in&s;trument of cry&s;tal made on purpo&s;e, letting out as much blood as they want.</P>
<P>In pains of the back, they rub the part af|fected before the fire, with a root of the cicuta, being careful not to touch the loins, which they &s;ay would produce &s;pa&s;ms. In pains of the joints, they place upon the part a little pyramid, made of a fungus which grows upon the birch|trees, and &s;et the top of it on fire, letting it burn till it comes to the &s;kin, which then cracks and leaves a wound that yields a great quantity of matter. This wound they cure with the a&s;hes of the fungus, but give them&s;elves no trouble at all about it. The root of the anemonides or ranunculus is made u&s;e of to hurt or poi&s;on their enemies; and they likewi&s;e poi&s;on their ar|rows with it.</P>

<HEAD>Burials.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of burying or laying the dead bodies in &s;ome hole, the Cam|chatcans
<PB N="296" REF="304">bind a &s;trap round the neck of the corp&s;e, draw it out and leave it near the hut, to be devoured by their dogs; for tho&s;e, &s;ay they, who are eaten by dogs, will drive with fine dogs in the other world; and, by leaving them near the hut, they &s;uppo&s;e, that the evil &s;pirits, whom they imagine to have been the occa&s;ion of their death, &s;eeing the dead body, may be &s;atisfied with the mi&s;chief they have done. However, they frequently remove to &s;ome other place, when any one has died in the hut, leaving the corp&s;e behind them in it.</P>
<P>They throw away all the cloaths of the decea&s;ed, not becau&s;e they imagine they &s;hall have occa|&s;ion for them in the other world, but becau&s;e they believe that whoever wears the cloaths of one that is dead, will certainly come to an un|timely end.</P>
<P>After the burial of the dead, they u&s;e the fol|lowing purification: going to the wood, they cut &s;ome rods, of which they make a ring, and, creeping through it twice, they carry it to the wood, and throw it towards the we&s;t. Tho&s;e who dragged out the body are obliged to catch two birds of one &s;ort or other, one of which they burn, and eat the other with the whole fa|mily. The purification is performed on the &s;ame
<PB N="297" REF="305">day; for, before this, they dare not enter any other hut, nor will any one el&s;e enter their's. In commemoration of the dead, the whole fa|mily dine upon a fi&s;h, the fins of which they burn in the fire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE Camchatcans have this particular cu&s;tom, that they en|deavour to give every thing a name in their lan|guage which may expre&s;s the property of it; but if they do not under&s;tand the thing quite well them&s;elves, they then take a name from &s;ome foreign language, which perhaps has no relation to the thing it&s;elf: as, for example, they call a prie&s;t <HI>Bogbog,</HI> becau&s;e probably they hear him u&s;e the word bogbog, God. Bread they call <HI>Brightatin Aug&s;h,</HI> that is, Ru&s;&s;ian root; and thus the &s;everal other words to which their language is a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>It appears likely, that the Camchatcans lived formerly in Mungalia, beyond the river Amur, and made one people with the Mun|gals, which is farther confirmed by the follow|ing ob&s;ervations: &s;uch as the Camchatcans having &s;everal words common to the Mungal Chine&s;e language, as their terminations in <HI>ong, ing, oang, chin, cha, ching, k&s;i, k&s;ung;</HI> it would
<PB N="298" REF="306">be &s;till a greater proof, if we could &s;hew &s;c|veral words and &s;entences the &s;ame in both lan|guages.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Character, Cu&s;toms, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Camchat|cans are remark|able for their cowardice, boa&s;ting, and &s;lavi&s;h|ne&s;s to people who u&s;e them hard, and for their ob&s;tinacy and contempt of tho&s;e who treat them with gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o very far from being a cleanly people; their manner of living is &s;lovenly to the la&s;t degree; they never wa&s;h their hands nor face, nor cut their nails; they eat out of the &s;ame di&s;h with the dogs, which they never wa&s;h; they never comb their heads, but both men and women plait their hair in two locks, binding the ends with &s;mall ropes. When any hair &s;tarts out, they &s;ew it with threads to make it lie clo&s;e; by this means they have &s;uch a quantity of lice, that they can &s;crape them off by handfuls, and they are na&s;ty enough even to eat them. Tho&s;e that have not natural hair &s;ufficient, wear fal&s;e locks, &s;ometimes as much as weigh ten pounds, which makes their heads look like a haycock.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="307">They place their chief happine&s;s in idlene&s;s, and &s;atisfying their natural lu&s;t and appetites; which incline them to &s;inging, dancing, and re|lating of love &s;tories; and think it more eli|gible to die, than to lead a di&s;agreeable life, which opinion frequently leads them to &s;elf|murder. This was &s;o common after the con|que&s;t, that the Ru&s;&s;ians had great difficulty to put a &s;top to it. They have no notion of riches, fame, or honour; therefore, covetou&s;ne&s;s, am|bition and pride are unknown among them. On the other hand, they are carele&s;s, cruel, and lu&s;tful: the&s;e vices occa&s;ion frequent quarrels and wars among them, &s;ometimes with their neighbours, not from a de&s;ire of encrea&s;ing their power, but from &s;ome other cau&s;es; &s;uch as the carrying off their provi&s;ions, or rather their girls, which is frequently practi&s;ed as the mo&s;t &s;ummary method of procuring a wife.</P>
<P>When any man &s;eeks the friend&s;hip of an|other, he invites him to his hut, and for his entertainment dre&s;&s;es as much of his be&s;t vic|tuals as might &s;erve ten people. As &s;oon as the &s;tranger comes into the hut, which is made hot for his reception, both he and the ho&s;t &s;trip
<PB N="300" REF="308">them&s;elves naked; then great plenty of victuals is &s;et before the gue&s;t; and, whil&s;t he is eat|ing, the ho&s;t throws water upon red-hot &s;tones, until he makes the hut in&s;upportably hot. The &s;tranger endeavours all he can to bear this ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat, and to eat up all the victuals, whil&s;t the ho&s;t is &s;till endeavouring to oblige him to complain of the heat, and beg to be excu&s;ed from eating all up. It is reckoned a di&s;honour to the ho&s;t, and a mark of niggard|line&s;s, if he &s;hould not be able to accompli&s;h this. He him&s;elf eats nothing during the whole time, and is allowed to go out of the hut, but the &s;tranger is not &s;uffered to &s;tir, un|til he acknowledges him&s;elf overcome. At the&s;e fea&s;ts, they over eat them&s;elves to &s;uch a degree, that for three days they cannot bear the &s;ight of victuals, and are &s;carce able to move.</P>
<P>When the &s;tranger is gorged, and can no longer endure the heat, he purcha&s;es his di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion with pre&s;ents of dogs, cloaths, or what|ever el&s;e is agreeable to his ho&s;t. This, how|ever, is no injury, but a proof of friend&s;hip; for he expects, in turn, to u&s;e his friend in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="309">In their banquets, they treat their friends much in the &s;ame way, except that they do not torment them with heat, nor expect any pre&s;ents. When they entertain with the fat of &s;eals or whales, they cut it out in &s;lices; and the ho&s;t, kneeling before his company, with one of the&s;e &s;lices in one hand, and a knife in the other, thru&s;ts the fat into their mouths, crying, in a &s;urly tone, <HI>Ta na,</HI> and with his knife cuts off all that hangs out of their mouths, after they are crammed as full as they can hold. Who|ever wants any thing from another, may gene|rally obtain it upon the&s;e occa&s;ions; for it is reckoned di&s;honourable for the gue&s;t to refu&s;e his generous ho&s;t any thing.</P>
<P>It is very diverting to &s;ee them attempt to count above ten; for, having reckoned the fin|gers of both hands, they cla&s;p them together, which &s;ignifies ten; then they begin with their toes and count to twenty; after which they are quite confounded, and cry <HI>Metcha?</HI> that is, 'Where &s;hall I take more?' They reckon ten months in the year, &s;ome of which are longer and &s;ome &s;horter; for they do not divide them by the changes of the moon, but by the order of particular occurrences that happen in tho&s;e regions: they commonly divide our year into
<PB N="302" REF="310">two, &s;o that winter is one year and &s;ummer an|other: the &s;ummer year begins in May, the win|ter in November.</P>
<P>They do not di&s;tingui&s;h the days by any par|ticular appellation, nor form them into weeks or months, nor yet know how many days are in the month or year. They mark their epochs by &s;ome remarkable thing or other, &s;uch as the Arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians, the Great Rebellion, or the Fir&s;t Expedition to Camchatca.</P>
<P>They are ignorant of the cau&s;es of eclip&s;es, but when they happen, they carry fire out of their huts, and pray the luminary eclip&s;ed to &s;hine as formerly. They know only three con|&s;tellations, the Great Bear, the Pleiades, and the three &s;tars in Orion; and give names only to the principal winds.</P>
<P>Such was the general &s;tate of the&s;e people, when the Ru&s;&s;ians fir&s;t came among them; but now, by the care of the Empre&s;s Elizabeth, mi&s;&s;ionaries are appointed to civilize them, and teach them the Chri&s;tian faith. In 1741, a clergyman was &s;ent by the &s;ynod, with a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e, and for building a church, which has been attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that many of them are bap|ti&s;ed, and all, as was &s;aid before, &s;end their
<PB N="303" REF="311">children very readily to the &s;chools opened in many places for their in&s;truction; &s;o that in a few years, we may hope to &s;ee the Chri&s;tian faith planted in all the&s;e northern countries.</P>

<P><HI>Publi&s;hed by</HI> R. BALDWIN, THE PHYSICAL FRIEND; POINTING OUT THE SYMPTOMS Of every DISTEMPER incident to MAN; With tho&s;e in every STAGE of the DISEASE, and what they foretell.</P>
<P>TOGETHER WITH AN ALPHABETICAL INDEX Of the &s;ame SYMPTOMS;</P>
<P>By which the &s;ick Per&s;on, referring to any one that attacks him, may find out his Di&s;order, and his real Situation.</P>
<P>By an occa&s;ional Recour&s;e to this Book, many a tor|menting and expen&s;ive Sickne&s;s may be prevented, and many a Life be &s;aved; for even fatal Di&s;orders are, at fir&s;t, but &s;light Indi&s;po&s;itions; of cour&s;e the &s;ick Per&s;on, not aware of his Danger, has too often delayed &s;eeking for a Remedy, till the Di&s;temper has gained too much Ground to be ea&s;ily overcome, and perhaps has de&s;troyed him, when, by oppo&s;ing it in Time, he might readily have recovered.</P>
<P>In this Work, Phy&s;ical Terms are purpo&s;ely avoided, that it may be under&s;tood by every Reader; being calculated to &s;hew the Danger of particular Di&s;ea&s;es in their fir&s;t Attack; in what Ca&s;es it is nece&s;&s;ary to call in Advice, and in certain Situations what Hopes there are of Recovery.</P>
<P>Carefully collected from the be&s;t Medical Authors, and &s;y&s;tematically arranged, with the Authorities.</P>
