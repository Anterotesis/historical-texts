<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are of an age when the heart opens to the mo&s;t warm and generous impre&s;&s;ions; an age, when all that gives worth and dignity to elevated rank, takes full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bo&s;om. At this bright and unprejudiced cri&s;is of your life, the precepts of Omar and the practice of Hamet, as drawn by Hawke&s;worth, and dramati&s;ed by the author of this tragedy, will win upon your attention; not indeed by the attraction of poetry, but by the natural reverence which un&s;potted youth ever renders, and with delight, to faithful
<PB N="ii" REF="4">repre&s;entations of wi&s;dom and of virtue; the wi&s;dom of the patriot, the virtue of the prince.</P>
<P>That your Royal Highne&s;s may very long reflect ble&s;&s;ings on the people of Eng|land, and prove a di&s;tingui&s;hed honour to the illu&s;trious family who have that gene|rous people in charge, is the zealous prayer, as it is the mo&s;t empa&s;&s;ioned expecta|tion, of</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS tragedy borrows its general &s;tory, and &s;ome of its incidents, with as much of its &s;entiment as could be pre&s;erved, from the very beautiful <HI>"Almoran</HI> and <HI>Hamet"</HI> of Hawke&s;worth. Except that truth and ju&s;tice call for &s;uch acknowledgement, it would on any other &s;core have been unnece&s;&s;ary; for what can be added to the fame of a work univer&s;ally celebrated? The original <HI>machinery</HI> has been rejected, becau&s;e it would have been too daring an attempt to interweave it with the fable of a modern compo&s;ition, and perhaps too mighty a ta&s;k to manage without violating the fir&s;t great law of dramatick probability. At the &s;ame time, it has been the authour's mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous endeavour, to "convert the &s;ententious di&s;|play of ea&s;tern wi&s;dom, as far as character would permit, into the language of pa&s;&s;ion, varied by every motive which might mo&s;t forcibly affect the human mind in the mo&s;t warm and intere&s;ting &s;ituations." The&s;e are the words of a critick, who &s;eems fully to have penetrated the de&s;ign of the author. The lines with inverted com|mas were omitted in the repre&s;entation, to fa|vour the rapidity of the action. They are re|tained
<PB N="8" REF="6">in the printed copy, not more at the in&s;tance of particular friends, than on general experience that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which retard the force of the pa&s;&s;ion on the theatre, are frequently read with mo&s;t &s;atisfaction in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The Play &s;till continuing to be received on the &s;tage with the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s, the author would but half di&s;charge the debt of equity were he to confe&s;s obligations to Hawke&s;|worth only. The liberal, perhaps the unequalled &s;upport which the managers have afforded by the &s;cenery, the intere&s;ting manner in which Mr. Linley has &s;et the Epithalamium, the ta&s;te of Mr. De Loutherberg, and the &s;plendour which the performers have thrown over the characters by their EXCELLENT repre&s;entation, demand and receive the mo&s;t warm and pointed expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. There remains but one tribute of ju&s;tice more, and <HI>that</HI> is due to Mr. Sheridan, who&s;e attention has, on this occa&s;ion, been friend&s;hip, and who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t always be fame.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The following prologue, from an honour-giving mu&s;e, of which it is truly worthy, did not arrive till after Mr. Banni&s;ter was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the excellent poetry which precedes it; and which another ingenious friend had been &s;ollicited to &s;upply. The author of the tragedy, however, thinks Mi&s;s Seward's compo&s;ition too valuable to circulate only in manu&s;cript. Indeed, to keep &s;uch ver&s;es out of print, would not only be a private injury to the piece (which they will adorn) but an unpardonable inju&s;tice to the public.</HI></P>
