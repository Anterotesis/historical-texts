</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE dawn of morning now trembled through the clouds, when the travellers &s;topped at a &s;mall town to change hor&s;es. Theodore entreated Adeline to alight and take &s;ome re|fre&s;hment, and to this &s;he at length con&s;ented. But the people of the inn were not yet up, and it was &s;ome time before the knocking and roar|ing of the po&s;tillion could rou&s;e them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Having taken &s;ome &s;light refre&s;hment, Theo|dore and Adeline returned to the carriage. The only &s;ubject upon which Theodore could have &s;poke with intere&s;t, delicacy forbade him at this time to notice; and after pointing out &s;ome beautiful &s;cenery on the road, and making other efforts to &s;upport a conver&s;ation, he relap&s;ed into &s;ilence. His mind, though &s;till anxious, was now relieved from the apprehen&s;ion that had long oppre&s;&s;ed it. When he fir&s;t &s;aw Ade|line, her loveline&s;s made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his heart: there was a &s;entiment in her beauty, which his mind immediately acknowledged, and the effect of which, her manners and con|ver&s;ation had afterwards confirmed. Her charms appeared to him like tho&s;e &s;ince &s;o finely de&s;|cribed by an Engli&s;h poet:
<Q><LG>
<L>"Oh! have you &s;een, bath' d in the morning dew,</L>
<L>"The budding ro&s;e its infant bloom di&s;play;</L>
<L>"When fir&s;t its virgin tints unfold to view,</L>
<L>"It &s;hrinks and &s;carcely tru&s;ts the blaze of day?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"So &s;oft &s;o delicate, &s;o &s;weet &s;he came,</L>
<L>"Youth's dama&s;k glow ju&s;t dawning on her cheek.</L>
<L>"I gaz'd, I &s;igh'd, I caught the tender flame,</L>
<L>"Felt the fond pang, and droop'd with pa&s;&s;ion weak."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>A knowledge of her de&s;titute condition, and of the dangers with which &s;he was environed, had awakened in his heart the tendere&s;t touch of pity, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the change of admiration into love. The di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered, when com|pelled to leave her expo&s;ed to the&s;e dangers,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
without being able to warn her of them, can on|ly be imagined. During his re&s;idence with his regiment, his mind was the con&s;tant prey of ter|rors, which he &s;aw no means of combating, but by returning to the neighbourhood of the abbey, where he might obtain early intelligence of the Marquis's &s;chemes, and be ready to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Adeline.</P>
<P>Leave of ab&s;ence he could not reque&s;t, with|out betraying his de&s;ign where mo&s;t he dreaded it &s;hould be known, and, at length, with a gene|rous ra&s;hne&s;s, which, though it defied law was impelled by virtue, he &s;ecretly quitted his regiment. The progre&s;s of the Marquis's plan he had ob&s;erved, with trembling anxiety, till, the night that was to decide the fate of Adeline and him&s;elf rou&s;ed all his mind to action, and involved him in a tumult of hope and fear&mdash;hor|ror and expectation.</P>
<P>Never, till the pre&s;ent hour, had he ventured to believe &s;he was in &s;afety. Now the di&s;tance they had gained from the chateau, without per|ceiving any pur&s;uit, increa&s;ed his be&s;t hopes. It was impo&s;&s;ible he could &s;it by the &s;ide of his beloved Adeline, and receive a&s;&s;urances of her gra|titude and e&s;teem, without venturing to hope for her love. He congratulated him&s;elf as her pre&s;er|ver, and anticipated &s;cenes of happine&s;s when &s;he &s;hould be under the protection of his family. The clouds of mi&s;ery and apprehen&s;ion di&s;appear|ed from his mind, and left it to the &s;un&s;hine of joy.
<PB N="6" REF="5">
When a &s;hadow of fear would &s;ometimes return, or when he recollected, with compunction, the circum&s;tances under which he had left his regi|ment, &s;tationed, as it was, upon the frontiers, and in a time of war, he looked at Adeline, and her countenance, with in&s;tantaneous magic, beamed peace upon his heart.</P>
<P>But Adeline had a &s;ubject of anxiety from which Theodore was exempt; the pro&s;pect of her future days was involved in darkne&s;s and uncertainty. Again &s;he was going to claim the bounty of &s;trangers&mdash;again going to en|counter the uncertainty of their kindne&s;s; ex|po&s;ed to the hard&s;hips of dependance, or to the dif|ficulty of earning a precarious livelihood. The&s;e anticipations ob&s;cured the joy occa&s; oned by her e&s;cape, and by the affection which the conduct and avowal of Theodore had exhibited. The delicacy of his behaviour, in forbearing to take advantage of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation to plead his love, increa&s;ed her e&s;teem, and flattered her pride.</P>
<P>Adeline was lo&s;t in meditation upon &s;ubjects like the&s;e, when the po&s;tillion &s;topped the car|riage; and pointing to part of a road, which wound down the &s;ide of a hill they had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;aid there were &s;everal hor&s;emen in pur&s;uit! Theodore immediately ordered him to proceed with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and to &s;trike out of the great road into the fir&s;t ob&s;cure way that offered. The po&s;tillion cracked his whip in the air, and
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;et off as if he was flying for life. In the mean while Theodore endeavoured to re-animate Ade|line, who was &s;inking with terror, and who now thought, if &s;he could only e&s;cape from the Marquis, &s;he could defy the future.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently they &s;truck into a bye lane, &s;creened and over&s;hadowed by thick trees; Theodore again looked from the window, but the clo&s;ing boughs prevented his &s;eeing far enough to deter|mine whether the pur&s;uit continued. For his &s;ake Adeline endeavoured to di&s;gui&s;e her emo|tions. <Q REND="inline">"This lane,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"will certainly lead to a town or village, and then we have nothing to apprehend; for, though my &s;ingle arm could not defend you again&s;t the number of our pur&s;uers, I have no doubt of being a'le to intere&s;t &s;ome of the inhabitants in our behalf."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline appeared to be comforted by the hope this reflection &s;ugge&s;ted, and Theodore aga n looked back, but the windings of the road clo|&s;ed his view, and the rattling of the wheels over|came every other &s;ound. At length he called to the po&s;tillion to &s;top, and having li&s;tened at|tentively, without perceiving any &s;ound of hor|&s;es, he began to hope they were now in &s;afety. <Q REND="inline">"Do you know where this road leads?"</Q> &s;aid he. The po&s;tillion an&s;wered that he did not, but he &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es through the trees at a di&s;tance, and believed it led to them. This was mo&s;t welcome intelligence to Theodore,
<PB N="8" REF="7" MS="y">
who looked forward and perceived the hou&s;es. The po&s;tillion &s;et off, <Q REND="inline">"Fear nothing, my adored Adeline,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you are now &s;afe; I will part with you but with life."</Q> Adeline &s;ighed, not for her&s;elf only, but for the danger to which Theodore might be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>They had continued to travel in this man|ner for near half an hour, when they arrived at a &s;mall village, and &s;oon after &s;topped at an inn, the be&s;t the place afforded. As Theodore lifted Adeline from the chai&s;e, he again entreat|ed her to di&s;mi&s;s her apprehen&s;ions, and &s;poke with a tenderne&s;s, to which &s;he could reply only by a &s;mile that ill concealed her anxiety. After ordering refre&s;hments, he went out to &s;peak with the landlord, but had &s;carcely left the room, when Adeline ob&s;erved a party of hor&s;e|men enter the inn-yard, and &s;he had no doubt the&s;e were the per&s;ons from whom they fled. The faces of two of them only were turned to|wards her, but &s;he thought the figure of one of the others not unlike that of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Her heart was chilled, and for &s;ome moments the powers of rea&s;on for&s;ook her. Her fir&s;t de|&s;ign was to &s;eek concealment; but while &s;he con&s;idered the means, one of the hor&s;emen look|ed up to the window near which &s;he &s;tood, and &s;peaking to his companions, they entered the inn. To quit the room, without being ob&s;er|ved, was impo&s;&s;ible; to remain there, alone and unprotected as &s;he was, would almo&s;t be
<PB N="9" REF="8">
equally dangerous. She paced the room in an ago ny of terror, often &s;ecretly calling on Theodore and often wondering he did not return. The&s;e were moments of inde&s;cribable &s;uffering. A loud and tumultuous &s;ound of voices now aro&s;e from a di&s;tant part of the hou&s;e, and &s;he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed the words of the di&s;putants. <Q REND="inline">"I arre&s;t you in the King's name,"</Q> &s;aid one <Q REND="inline">"and bid You, at your peril, attempt to go from hence, except under a guard."</Q></P>
<P>The next minute Adeline heard the voice of Theodore in reply. <Q REND="inline">"I do not mean to di&s;|pute the King's orders,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and give you my word of honour not to go without you; but fir&s;t unhand me, that I may return to that room; I have a friend there whom I wi&s;h to &s;peak with."</Q> To this propo&s;al they at fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t objected, con&s;idering it merely as an ex|cu&s;e to obtain an opportunity of e&s;caping; but after much altercation and entreaty, his reque&s;t was granted. He &s;prang forwards towards the room where Adeline remained, and while a &s;erjeant and corporal followed him to the door, the two &s;oldiers went out into the yard of the inn, to watch the windows of the apartment.</P>
<P>With an eager hand he unclo&s;ed the door, but Adeline ha&s;tened not to meet him, for &s;he had fainted almo&s;t at the beginning of the di&s;|pute. Theodore called loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn &s;oon appeared with her &s;tock of remedies, which were admini&s;tered
<PB N="10" REF="9">
in vain to Adeline, who remained in&s;en&s;ible, and by breathing alone gave &s;igns of her exi&s;t|ence. The di&s;tre&s;s of Theodore was in the mean time heightened by the appearance of the offi|cers, who, laughing at the di&s;covery of his pretended friend, declared they could wait no longer. Saying this, they would have forced him from the inanimate form of Adeline, over whom he hung in unutterable angui&s;h, when fiercely turning upon them, he drew his &s;word and &s;wore no power on earth &s;hould force him away before the lady recovered.</P>
<P>The men, enraged by the action and the de|termined air of Theodore, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Do you oppo&s;e the King's orders?"</Q> and advanced to &s;eize him, but he pre&s;ented the point of his &s;word, and bid them at their peril approach. One of them immediately drew, Theodore kept his guard, but did not advance. <Q REND="inline">"I demand only to wait here, till the lady recovers,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"you under&s;tand the alternative."</Q> The man, already exa&s;perated by the oppo&s;ition of Theodore, regarded the latter part of his &s;peech as a threat, and became determined not to give up the point; he pre&s;&s;ed forward, and while his comrade called the men from the yard, Theo|dore wounded him &s;lightly in the &s;houlder, and received him&s;elf the &s;troke of a &s;abre on his head.</P>
<P>The blood gu&s;hed furiou&s;ly from the wound; Theodore, &s;taggering to a chair, &s;unk into it, ju&s;t as the remainder of the party entered the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
room, and Adeline unclo&s;ed her eyes to &s;ee him gha&s;tly pale, and covered with blood. She ut|tered an involuntary &s;cream, and exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"they have murdered him,"</Q> nearly relap&s;ed. At the &s;ound of her voice he rai&s;ed his head, and &s;miling held out his hand to her. <Q REND="inline">"I am not much hurt,"</Q> &s;aid he faintly, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;hall &s;oon be better, if indeed you are recovered."</Q> She ha&s;tened towards him, and gave her hand. <Q REND="inline">"Is nobody gone for a &s;urgeon?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, with a look of agony. <Q REND="inline">"Do not be alarmed,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"I am not &s;o ill as you imagine."</Q> The room was now crowded with people, whom the report of the affray had brought together; among the&s;e was a man, who acted as phy&s;i|cian, apothecary, and &s;urgeon to the village, and who now &s;tepped forward to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Theodore.</P>
<P>Having examined the wound, he declined giving his opinion, but ordered the patient to be immediately put to bed, to which the officers objected, alledging that it was their duty to car|ry him to the regiment. <Q REND="inline">"That cannot be done without great danger to his life,"</Q> re|plied the doctor; <Q REND="inline">"and"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Oh! his life,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;erjeant; <Q REND="inline">"we have nothing to do with that, we mu&s;t do our duty."</Q> Adeline, who had hitherto &s;tood in trembling anxiety, could now no longer be &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"Since the &s;urgeon,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"has declared it his opinion, that this gentleman cannot be removed in his pre&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="11">
condition, without endangering his life, you will remember, that if he dies, yours will probably an&s;wer it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> rejoined the &s;urgeon, who was un|willing to relinqui&s;h his patient, <Q REND="inline">"I declare be|fore the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, that he cannot be remov|ed with &s;afety: you will do well, therefore, to con&s;ider the con&s;equences. He has receiv|ed a very dangerous wound, which requires the mo&s;t careful treatment, and the event is even then doubtful; but if he travels, a fever may en&s;ue, and the wound will then be mor|tal."</Q> Theodore heard this &s;entence with compo&s;ure, but Adeline could with difficulty conceal the angui&s;h of her heart: &s;he rou&s;ed all her fortitude to &s;uppre&s;s the tears that &s;truggled in her eyes; and though &s;he wi&s;hed to intere&s;t the humanity, or to awaken the fears of the men, in behalf of their unfortunate pri&s;oner, &s;he dared not to tru&s;t her voice with utterance.</P>
<P>From this internal &s;truggle &s;he was relieved by the compa&s;&s;ion of the people who filled the room, and becoming clamorous in the cau&s;e of Theodore, declared the officers would be guilty of murder if they removed him. <Q REND="inline">"Why he mu&s;t die at any rate,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;erjeant, <Q REND="inline">"for quitting his po&s;t, and drawing upon me in the execution of the King's orders."</Q> A faint &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized the heart of Adeline, and &s;he leaned for &s;upport again&s;t Theodore's chair, who&s;e concern for him&s;elf was for a while &s;u&s;|pended
<PB N="13" REF="12">
in his anxiety for her. He &s;upported her with his arm, and forcing a &s;mile, &s;aid in a low voice, which &s;he only could hear, <Q REND="inline">"This is a mi&s;repre&s;entation; I doubt not, when the affair is inquired into, it will be &s;ettled with|out any &s;erious con&s;equences."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline knew the&s;e words were uttered only to con&s;ole her, and therefore did not give much credit to them, though Theodore continued to give her &s;imilar a&s;&s;urances of his &s;afety. Mean|while the mob, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion for him had been gradually excited by the obduracy of the officer, were now rou&s;ed to pity and indignation by the &s;eeming certainty of his puni&s;hment, and the unfeeling manner, in which it had been denounced. In a &s;hort time they became &s;o much enraged, that, partly from a dread of farther con&s;equences, and partly from the &s;hame which their charges of cruelty occa&s;ioned, the &s;erjeant con&s;ented that he &s;hould be put to bed, till his commanding officer might direct what was to be done. Adeline's joy at this circum|&s;tance overcame for a moment the &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes, and of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>She waited in an adjoining room the &s;entence of the &s;urgeon, who was now engaged in exa|mining the wound; and though the accident would in any other circum&s;tances have &s;everely afflicted her, &s;he now lamented it the more, be|cau&s;e &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as the cau&s;e of it,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
and becau&s;e the misfortune, by illu&s;trating more fully the affection of her lover, drew him clo&s;er to her heart, and &s;eemed, therefore, to &s;harpen the poignancy of her affliction. The dreadful a&s;&s;ertion that Theodore, &s;hould he re|cover, would be puni&s;hed with death, &s;he &s;carce|ly dared to con&s;ider, but endeavoured to believe that it was no more than a cruel exaggeration of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Theodore's pre&s;ent danger, together with the attendant circum&s;tances, awakened all her tenderne&s;s, and di&s;covered to her the true &s;tate of her affections. The grace|ful form, the noble, intelligent countenance, and the engaging manners which &s;he had at fir&s;t admired in Theodore, became afterwards more intere&s;ting by that &s;trength of thought, and ele|gance of &s;entiment, exhibited in his conver&s;ati|on. His conduct, &s;ince her e&s;cape, had excited her warme&s;t gratitude, and the danger which he had now encountered in her behalf, called forth her tenderne&s;s, and heightened it into love. The veil was removed from her heart, and &s;he &s;aw for the fir&s;t time, its genuine emotions.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon at length came out of Theodore's chamber into the room where Adeline was waiting to &s;peak with him. She inquired con|cerning the &s;tate of his wound. <Q REND="inline">"You are a relation of the gentleman's, I pre&s;ume, Ma|dam; his &s;i&s;ter, perhaps"</Q> The que&s;tion vexed and embarra&s;&s;ed her, and, without an|&s;wering
<PB N="15" REF="14">
it, &s;he repeated her inquiry. <Q REND="inline">"Per|haps, Madam, you are more nearly related,"</Q> pur&s;ued the &s;urgeon, &s;eeming al&s;o to di&s;regard her que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"perhaps you are his wife."</Q> Adeline blu&s;hed, and was about to reply, but he continued his &s;peech. <Q REND="inline">"The intere&s;t you take in his welfare is, at lea&s;t, very flattering, and I would almo&s;t con&s;ent to exchange con|ditions with him, were I &s;ure of receiving &s;uch tender compa&s;&s;ion from &s;o charming a lady."</Q> Saying this, he bowed to the ground. Adeline a&s;&s;uming a very re&s;erved air, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now, Sir, that you have concluded your compliment, you will perhaps, attend to my que&s;tion; I hav enquired how you left your patient."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, Madam, is, perhaps, a que&s;tion very difficult to be re&s;olved; and it is likewi&s;e a very di&s;agreeable office to pronounce ill news&mdash;I fear he will die."</Q> The &s;urgeon opened his &s;nuff-box and pre&s;ented it to Adeline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <Q REND="inline">"Die!"</Q> &s;he exclaimed in a faint voice, <Q REND="inline">"Die!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not be alarmed, Madam,"</Q> re&s;umed the &s;urgeon, ob&s;erving her grow pale, <Q REND="inline">"do not be alarmed. It is po&s;&s;ible that the wound may not have reached the &mdash;,"</Q> he &s;tammered; <Q REND="inline">"in that ca&s;e the &mdash;,"</Q> &s;tammering again, <Q REND="inline">"is not affected; and if &s;o, the interior mem|branes of the brain are not touched: in this ca&s;e the wound may, perhaps, e&s;cape inflam|mation,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and the patient may po&s;&s;ibly recover. But if, on the other hand, &mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I be&s;eech you, Sir, to &s;peak intelligibly,"</Q> interrupted Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"and not to trifle with my anxiety. Do you really believe him in danger?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In danger, Madam,"</Q> exclaimed the &s;ur|geon, <Q REND="inline">"in danger! yes, certainly, in very great danger."</Q> Saying this, he walked away with an air of chagrin and di&s;plea&s;ure. Adeline remained for &s;ome moments in the room, in an exce&s;s of &s;orrow, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train, and then drying her tears, and en|deavouring to compo&s;e her countenance, &s;he went to inquire for the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn, to whom &s;he &s;ent a waiter. After expecting her in vain for &s;ome time, &s;he rang the bell, and &s;ent another me&s;&s;age &s;omewhat more pre&s;&s;ing. Still the ho&s;te&s;s did not appear, and Adeline, at length, went her&s;elf down &s;tairs, where &s;he found her, &s;urrounded by a number of people, relating, with a loud voice and va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ious ge&s;ti|culations, the particulars of the late accident. Perceiving Adeline, &s;he called out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! here is Mademoi&s;elle her&s;elf,"</Q> and the eyes of the a&s;&s;embly were immediately turned upon her. Adeline, whom the crowd prevented from approaching the ho&s;te&s;s, now beckoned her, and was going to withdraw, but the land|lady, eager in the pur&s;uit of her &s;tory, di&s;|regarded the &s;ignal. In vain did Adeline en-<PB N="17" REF="16">
endeavour
to catch her eye; it glanced every where but upon her, who was unwilling to attract the farther notice of the crowd by calling out.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is a great pity, to be &s;ure, that he &s;hould be &s;hot,"</Q> &s;aid the landlady, <Q REND="inline">"he's &s;uch a hand&s;ome man; but they &s;ay he certainly will if he recovers. Poor Gentleman! he will very likely not &s;uffer though, for the doctor &s;ays he will never go out of this hou&s;e alive."</Q> Adeline now &s;poke to a man who &s;tood near, and de&s;iring he would tell the ho&s;te&s;s &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak with her, left the place.</P>
<P>In about ten minutes the landlady appeared. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! Madamoi&s;elle,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"your brother is in a &s;ad condition; they fear he won't get over it."</Q> Adeline inquired whether there was any other medical per&s;on in the town than the &s;urgeon whom &s;he had &s;een. <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Madam, this is a rare healthy place; we have little need of <HI>medicine</HI> people here; &s;uch an accident never happened in it before. The doctor has been here ten years, but there's very bad encouragement for his trade, and I believe he's poor enough him&s;elf. One of the &s;ort's quite enough for us."</Q> Adeline interrupted her to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions concern|ing Theodore, whom the ho&s;te's had attended to his chamber. She inquired how he had borne the dre&s;&s;ing of the wound, and whether he ap|peared to be ea&s;ier after the operation; que&s;tions
<PB N="18" REF="17">
to which the ho&s;te&s;s gave no very &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. She now inquired whether there was any &s;urgeon in the neighbourhood of the town, and was told there was not.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s vi&s;ible in Adeline's countenance &s;eemed to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the landlady, who now endeavoured to con&s;ole her in the be&s;t manner &s;he was able. She advi&s;ed her to &s;end for her friends, and offered to procure a me&s;|&s;enger. Adeline &s;ighed and &s;aid it was un|nece&s;&s;ary. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Ma'am&s;elle, what you may think nece&s;&s;ary,"</Q> continued the ho&s;te&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"but I know I &s;hould think it very hard to die in a &s;trange place with no relati|ons near me, and I dare &s;ay the poor gentle|man thinks &s;o him&s;elf; and, be&s;ides, who is to pay for his funeral if he dies?"</Q> Adeline begged &s;he would be &s;ilent, and, de&s;iring that every proper attention might be given, &s;he promi&s;ed her a reward for her trouble, and re|que&s;ted pen and ink immediately. <Q REND="inline">"Ay, to be &s;ure, Ma'am&s;elle, that is the proper way; why your friends would never forgive you if you did not acquaint them; I know it by my|&s;elf. And as for taking care of him, he &s;hall have every thing the hou&s;e affords, and I warrant there is never a better inn in the pro|vince, though the town is none of the big|ge&s;t."</Q> Adeline was obliged to repeat her re|que&s;t for pen and ink, before the loquacious ho&s;te&s;s would quit the room.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
The thought of &s;ending for Theodore's friends had, in the tumult of the late &s;cenes, never oc|curred to her, and &s;he was now &s;omewhat con|&s;oled by the pro&s;pect of comfort which it opened for him. When the pen and ink were brought, &s;he wrote the following note to Theodore.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In your pre&s;ent condition, you have need of every comfort that can be procured you, and &s;urely there is no cordial more valuable in illne&s;s, than the pre&s;ence of a friend: &s;uffer me, therefore to acquaint your family with your &s;ituation; it will be a &s;atisfaction to me, and, I doubt not, a con&s;olation to you."</Q></P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after &s;he had &s;ent the note, &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from Theodore, en|treating mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, but earne&s;tly, to &s;ee her for a few minutes. She immediately went to his chamber, and found her wor&s;t appre|hen&s;ions confirmed, by the languor expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance, while the &s;hock &s;he received, together with her &s;truggle to di&s;gui&s;e her emo|tions, almo&s;t overcame her. <Q REND="inline">"I thank you for this goodne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he, extending his hand which &s;he received, and, &s;itting down by the bed, bur&s;t into a flood of tears. When her agitation had &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;ided, and, remov|ing her handkerchief from her eyes, &s;he again looked on Theodore, a &s;mile of the tendere&s;t love expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;e of the intere&s;t &s;he took in his welfare, and admini&s;tered a temporary relief to her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">

<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not like him,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"but tell me how you find your&s;elf?"</Q> He a&s;&s;ured her that he was now much ea&s;ier than he had yet been, and mentioning her kind note, he led to the &s;ubject, on account of which he had &s;olicited to &s;ee her. <Q REND="inline">"My family,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"re&s;ide at a great di&s;tance from hence, and I well know their affection is &s;uch, that, were they informed of my &s;ituation, no con|&s;ideration, however rea&s;onable, could prevent their coming to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but before they can arrive, their pre&s;ence will probably be unnece&s;&s;ary,"</Q> (Adeline looked earne&s;tly at him) <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould probably be well,"</Q> pur|&s;ued he, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"before a letter could reach them; it would, therefore, occa&s;ion them unnece&s;&s;ary pain, and, moreover, a fruitle&s;s journey. For your &s;ake, Adeline, I could wi&s;h they were here, but a few days will more fully &s;hew the con&s;equences of my wound: let us wait, at lea&s;t, till then, and be directed by circum&s;tances."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline forbore to pre&s;s the &s;ubject farther, and turned to one more immediately inte|re&s;ting.
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<Q REND="inline">"I much wi&s;h,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that you had a more able &s;urgeon; you know the geography of the province better than I do; are we in the neighbourhood ofany town likely to afford you other advice?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and this is an affair of little con&s;equence, for my wound is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that a very moderate &s;hare of &s;kill may &s;uffice to cure it. But why, my beloved Adeline, do you give way to this anxiety? Why &s;uffer your&s;elf to be di&s;turbed by this tendency to forbode the wor&s;t? I am willing, perhaps pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly &s;o, to attribute it to your kindne&s;s, and &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you, that, while it excites my gratitude, it increa&s;es my ten|dere&s;t e&s;teem. O Adeline! &s;ince you wi&s;h my &s;peedy recovery, let me &s;ee you compo&s;|ed: while I believe you to be unhappy I can|not be well."&mdash;</Q>She a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would endeavour to be, at lea&s;t, tranquil, and fearing the conver&s;ation, if prolonged, would be preju|dicial to him, &s;he left him to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;he turned cut of the gallery, &s;he met the ho&s;te&s;s, upon whom certain words of Adeline had operated as a tali&s;man, transforming neglect and impertinence into officious civility. She came to enquire whether the gentleman above &s;tairs had every thing that he liked, for &s;he was &s;ure it was her endeavour that he &s;hould. <Q REND="inline">"I have got him a nur&s;e, Ma'am&s;elle, to attend
<PB N="22" REF="21">
him, and I dare &s;ay &s;he will do very well, but I will look to that, for I &s;hall not mind helping him my&s;elf &s;ome times. Poor gentle|man! how patiently he bears it! One would not think now that he believes he is going to die; yet the doctor told him &s;o him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t as good."</Q> Adeline was extremely &s;hocked at this imprudent conduct of the &s;ur|geon, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the landlady, after ordering a &s;light dinner.</P>
<P>Towards evening the &s;urgeon again made his appearance, and, having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with his patient, returned to the parlour, according to the de&s;ire of Adeline, to inform her of his con|dition. He an&s;wered Adeline's inquiries with great &s;olemnity. <Q REND="inline">"It is impo&s;&s;ible to determine po&s;itively, at pre&s;ent, Madam, but I have rea&s;on to adhere to the opinion I gave you this morning. I am not apt, indeed, to form opinions upon uncertain grounds. I will give you a &s;ingular in&s;tance of this:</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not above a fortnight &s;ince I was &s;ent for to a patient at &s;ome leagues di&s;tance. I was from home when the me&s;&s;enger arrived, and the ca&s;e being urgent, before I could reach the patient, another phy&s;ician was con&s;ulted, who had ordered &s;uch medicines as he thought proper, and the patient had been apparently relieved by them. His friends were con|gratulating them&s;elves upon his improvement when I arrived, and had agreed in opinion
<PB N="23" REF="22">
with the phy&s;ician, that there was no danger in his ca&s;e. Depend upon it, &s;aid I, you are mi&s;taken; the&s;e medicines cannot have relieved him; the patient is in the utmo&s;t danger. The patient groaned, but my bro|ther phy&s;ician per&s;i&s;ted in affirming that the remedies he had pre&s;cribed would not only be certain, but &s;peedy, &s;ome good effect having been already produced by them. Upon this I lo&s;t all patience, and adhering to my opinion, that the&s;e effects were fallacious and the ca&s;e de&s;perate, I a&s;&s;ured the patient him&s;elf that his life was in the utmo&s;t danger. I am not one of tho&s;e, Madam, who deceive their pati|ents to the la&s;t moment; but you &s;hall hear the conclu&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My brother phy&s;ician was, I &s;uppo&s;e, en|raged by the firmne&s;s of my oppo&s;ition, for he a&s;&s;umed a mo&s;t angry look, which did not in the lea&s;t affect me, and turning to the patient, de&s;ired he would decide, upon which of our opinions to rely, for he mu&s;t decline acting with me. The patient did me the honour,"</Q> pur&s;ued the &s;urgeon, with a &s;mile of compla|cency, and &s;moothing his ruffles, <Q REND="inline">"to think more highly of me than, perhaps, I de&s;erved, for he immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my opponent. I could not have believed, &s;aid he, as the phy&s;ician left the room, I could not have believed that a man, who has been &s;o many
<PB N="24" REF="23">
in the profe&s;&s;ion, could be &s;o wholly ignorant of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could not have believed it either, &s;aid I.&mdash;I am a&s;toni&s;hed that he was not aware of my danger, re&s;umed the patient.&mdash;I am a&s;toni&s;hed likewi&s;e, replied I&mdash;I was re&s;olved to do what I could for the pati|ent, for he was a man of under&s;tanding, as you perceive, and I had a regard for him. I, therefore, altered the pre&s;criptions, and my&s;elf admini&s;tered the medicines; but all would not do, my opinion was verified, and he died even before the next morning."&mdash;</Q>Adeline, who had been compelled to li&s;ten to this long &s;tory, &s;ighed at the conclu&s;ion of it. <Q REND="inline">"I don't wonder that you are affected, Madam"</Q> &s;aid the &s;urgeon, <Q REND="inline">"the in&s;tance I have rela|ted is certainly a very affecting one. It di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed me &s;o much, that it was &s;ome time before I could think, or even &s;peak concern|ing it. But you mu&s;t allow, Madam,"</Q> continued he, lowering his voice and bowing with a look of &s;elf congratulation, <Q REND="inline">"that this was a &s;triking in&s;tance of the infallibility of my judgment."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline &s;huddered at the infallibility of his judgment, and made no reply. <Q REND="inline">"It was a &s;hock|ing thing for the poor man,"</Q> re&s;umed the &s;urgeon.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It was, indeed, very &s;hocking,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It affected me a good deal when it happened,"</Q> continued he.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Un|doubtedly, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
<Q REND="inline">"But time wears away the mo&s;t painful impre&s;&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think you mentioned it was about a fortnight &s;ince this happened."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Somewhere thereabouts,"</Q> replied the &s;urgeon, without &s;eeming to under&s;tand the ob&s;ervation.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And will you permit me, Sir, to a&s;k the name of the phy&s;ician, who &s;o ignorantly oppo&s;ed you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, Madam, it is Lafance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He lives in the ob&s;curity he de&s;erves, no doubt"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why no, Madam, he lives in a town of &s;ome note, at about the di&s;tance of four leagues from hence, and affords one in&s;tance, among many others, that the public opinion is generally erroneous. You will hardly believe it, but I a&s;&s;ure you it is a fact, that this man comes into a great deal of practice, while I am &s;uffered to remain here, ne|glected, and, indeed, very little known."</Q></P>
<P>During his narrative, Adeline had been con|&s;idering by what means &s;he could di&s;cover the name of the phy&s;ician, for the in&s;tance that had been produced to prove his <HI>ignorance,</HI> and the <HI>infallibility</HI> of his opponent, had complete|ly &s;ettled her opinion concerning them both. She now, more than ever, wi&s;hed to deliver Theodore from the hands of the &s;urgeon, and was mu&s;ing on the po&s;&s;ibility, when he, with &s;o much &s;elf-&s;ecurity, developed the means.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
She a&s;ked him a few more que&s;tions con|cerning the &s;tate of Theodore's wound, and was told it was much as it had been, but that &s;ome degree of fever had come on. <Q REND="inline">"But I have ordered a fire to be made in the room,"</Q> continued the &s;urgeon, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;ome additional blankets to be laid on the bed; the&s;e, I doubt not, will have a proper ef|fect. In the mean time they mu&s;t be careful to keep from him every kind of li|quid, except &s;ome cordial draughts, which I &s;hall &s;end. He will naturally a&s;k for drink, but it mu&s;t, on no ac|count, be given to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do not approve, then, of the method, which I have &s;omewhere heard of,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"of attending to nature in the&s;e ca&s;es."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nature, Madam!"</Q> pur&s;ued he, <Q REND="inline">"Nature is the mo&s;t improper guide in the world. I always adopt a method directly contrary to what &s;he would &s;ugge&s;t; for what can be the u&s;e of Art, if &s;he is only to follow Nature? This was my fir&s;t opinion on &s;etting out in life, and I have ever &s;ince &s;trict|ly adhered to it. From what I have &s;aid, indeed, Madam, you may, per|haps, perceive that my opinions may be depended on; what they once are they always are, for my mind is not of
<PB N="27" REF="26">
that frivolous kind to be affected by circum|&s;tances."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline was fatigued by this di&s;cour&s;e, and impatient to impart to Theodore her di&s;covery of a phy&s;ician, but the &s;urgeon &s;eemed by no means di&s;po&s;ed to leave her, and was expatiating upon various topics, with new in&s;tances of his &s;urpri&s;ing &s;agacity, when the waiter brought a me&s;&s;age that &s;ome per&s;on de&s;ired to &s;ee him. He was, howe|ver engaged upon too agreeable a topic to be ea&s;ily prevailed upon to quit it, and it was not till after a &s;econd me&s;&s;age was brought that he made his bow to Adeline and left the room. The moment he was gone &s;he &s;ent a note to Theodore, entreating his permi&s;&s;ion to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The conceited manners of the &s;urgeon had by this time given Theodore a very unfa|vourable opinion of his talents, and the la&s;t pre&s;cription had &s;o fully confirmed it, that he now readily con&s;ented to have other advice.</P>
<P>Adeline immediately inquired for a me&s;|&s;enger, but recollecting that the re&s;idence of the phy&s;ician was &s;till a &s;ecret, &s;he applied to the ho&s;te&s;s, who being really ignorant of it, or pretending to be &s;o, gave her no in|formation. What farther inquiries &s;he made were equally ineffectual, and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, while the di&s;order of Theodore rather increa&s;ed than abated.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
When &s;upper appeared, &s;he a&s;ked the boy who waited, if he knew a phy&s;ician of the name of Lafance, in the neighbour|hood. <Q REND="inline">"Not in the neighbourhood, Madam, but I know Doctor Lafance of Chancy, for I come from the town."&mdash;</Q>Ade|line inquired farther, and received very &s;atis|factory an&s;wers. But the town was at &s;ome leagues di&s;tance, and the delay this circum|&s;tance mu&s;t ocea&s;ion again alarmed her; &s;he, however, ordered a me&s;&s;enger to be immedi|ately di&s;patched, and, having &s;ent again to inquire concerning Theodore, retired to her chamber for the night.</P>
<P>The continued fatigue &s;he had &s;uffered for the la&s;t fourteen hours overcame anxiety, and her harra&s;&s;ed &s;pirits &s;unk to repo&s;e. She &s;lept till late in the morning, and was then awakened by the landlady, who came to in|form her that Theodore was much wor&s;e, and to inquire what &s;hould be done. Adeline, find|ing that the phy&s;ician was not arrived, im|mediately aro&s;e, and ha&s;tened to inquire far|ther concerning Theodore. The ho&s;te&s;s in|formed her, that he had pa&s;&s;ed a very di&s;turb|ed night; that he had complained of being very hot, and de&s;ired that the fire in his room might be extingui&s;hed; but that the nur&s;e knew her duty too well to obey him, and had &s;trictly followed the doctor's orders.</P>
<P>She added, that he had taken the cordial draughts regularly, but had, not with&s;tanding,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
continued to grow wor&s;e, and at la&s;t became light-headed. In the mean time the boy, who had been &s;ent for the phy&s;ician, was &s;till ab&s;ent:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And no wonder,"</Q> continued the ho&s;te&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"why only con&s;ider, it's eight leagues off, and the lad had to find the road, bad as it is, in the dark. But, indeed, Ma'am&s;elle, you might as well have tru&s;ted our doctor, for we never want any body el&s;e, not we, in the town here; and if I might &s;peak my mind, Jacques had better have been &s;ent off for the young gentleman's friends than for this &s;trange doctor that no body knows."</Q></P>
<P>After a&s;king &s;ome farther que&s;tions concern|ing Theodore, the an&s;wers to which rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed her alarm, Adeline endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and await in patience the arrival of the phy&s;ician. She was now more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the forlornne&s;s of her own condition, and of the danger of Theodore's, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed that his friends could be informed of his &s;itua|tion; a wi&s;h which could not be gratified, for Theodore, who alone could acquaint her with their place of re&s;idence, was deprived of recollection.</P>
<P>When the &s;urgeon arrived and perceived the &s;ituation of his patient, he expre&s;&s;ed no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urprize; but having a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions, and given a few general directions, he went
<PB N="30" REF="29">
down to Adeline. After paying her his u&s;ual compliments, he &s;uddenly a&s;&s;umed an air of importance, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that it is my office to communicate di&s;a|greeable intelligence, but I wi&s;h you to be prepared for the event, which, I fear, is approaching."</Q> Adeline comprehended his meaning, and though &s;he had hitherto given little faith to his judgment, &s;he could not hear him hint at the immediate danger of Theo|dore without yielding to the influence of fear.</P>
<P>She entreated him to acquaint her with all he apprehended; and he then proceeded to &s;ay, that Theodore was, as he had fore&s;een, much wor&s;e this morning than he had been the pre|ceding night; and the di&s;order having now affected his head, there was every rea&s;on to fear it would prove fatal in a few hours. <Q REND="inline">"The wor&s;t con&s;equences may en&s;ue,"</Q> continued he; <Q REND="inline">"if the wound becomes inflamed, there will be very little chance of his recovery."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline li&s;tened to this &s;entence with a dreadful calmne&s;s, and gave no utterance to grief, either by words or tears. <Q REND="inline">"The gentleman, I &s;uppo&s;e, Madam, has friends, and the &s;ooner you inform them of his condition the better. If they re&s;ide at any di&s;tance, it is indeed too late; but there are other nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;you are ill, Madam."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
Adedeline made an effort to &s;peak, but in vain, and the &s;urgeon now called loudly for a gla&s;s of water; &s;he drank it, and a deep &s;igh that &s;he uttered, &s;eemed &s;omewhat to relieve her oppre&s;&s;ed heart: tears &s;ucceeded. In the mean time, the &s;urgeon perceiving &s;he was better, though not well enough to li&s;ten to his conver&s;ation, took his leave, and promi&s;ed to return in an hour. The phy&s;i|cian was not yet arrived, and Adeline await|ed his appearance with a mixture of fear and anxious hope.</P>
<P>About noon he came, and having been informed of the accident by which the fever was produced, and of the treatment which the &s;urgeon had given it, he a&s;cended to Theodore's chamber: in a quarter of an hour he returned to the room where Adeline expect|ed him. <Q REND="inline">"The gentleman is &s;till delirious,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"but I have ordered him a com|po&s;ing draught."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Is there any hope, Sir?"</Q> inquired Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam, certainly there is hope; the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent is &s;omewhat doubtful, but a few hours may enable me to judge with more certainty. In the mean time, I have directed that he &s;hall be kept quiet, and be allowed to drink freely of &s;ome diluting liquids."</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;carcely, at Adeline's reque&s;t, re|commended a &s;urgeon, in&s;tead of the one at pre&s;ent employed, when the latter gentle|man
<PB N="32" REF="31">
entered the room, and perceiving the phy&s;ician, threw a glance of mingled &s;ur|prize and anger at Adeline, who retired with him to another apartment, where &s;he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him with a politene&s;s, which he did not deign to return, and which he certainly did not de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Early the following morning the &s;urgeon arrived, but either the medicines, or the cri&s;is of the di&s;order, had thrown Theodore into a deep &s;leep, in which he remained for &s;everal hours. The phy&s;ician now gave Adeline rea&s;on to hope for a fevourable i&s;&s;ue, and every pre|caution was taken to prevent his being di&s;|turbed. He awoke perfectly &s;en&s;ible and free from fever, and his fir&s;t words inquired for Adeline, who &s;oon learned that he was out of danger.</P>
<P>In a few days he was &s;ufficiently recover|ed to be removed from his chamber to a room adjoining, where Adeline met him with a joy, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;s; and the ob&s;ervance of this lighted up his countenance with plea&s;ure: indeed Adeline, &s;en&s;ible to the attachment he had &s;o nobly te&s;tified, and &s;oftned by the danger he had encountered, no longer attempted to di&s;gui&s;e the tenderne&s;s of her e&s;teem, and was at length brought to confe&s;s the intere&s;t his fir&s;t appearance had impre&s;&s;ed upon her heart.</P>

After an hour of affecting conver&s;ation, in which the happine&s;s of a young and mu|tual attachment occupied all their minds, and excluded every idea not in uni&s;on with delight, they returned to a &s;en&s;e of their pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments: Adeline recollect|ed that Theodore was arre&s;ted for di&s;obe|dience of orders, and de&s;erting his po&s;t; and Theodore, that he mu&s;t &s;hortly be torn away from Adeline, who would be left expo|&s;ed to all the evils from which he had &s;o lately re&s;cued her. This thought overwhelmed his heart with angui&s;h; and, after a long pau&s;e, he ventured to propo&s;e, what his wi&s;h|es had often &s;ugge&s;ted, a marriage with Adeline before he departed from the village: this was the only means of preveting, per|haps, an eternal &s;aparation; and though he &s;aw the many dangerous inconveniences to which &s;he would be expo&s;ed, by a marriage with a man circum&s;tanced like him&s;elf, yet the&s;e appeared &s;o unequal to tho&s;e &s;he would otherwi&s;e he left to encounter alone, that his rea&s;on could no longer &s;cruple to adopt what his affection had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>Adeline was, for &s;ome time, too much agitated to reply; and though &s;he had little to oppo&s;e to the arguments and pleadings of Theodore; though &s;he had no friends to control, and no contrariety of intere&s;ts to per|plex,
<PB N="34" REF="33">
her &s;he could not bring her&s;elf to con&s;ent thus ha&s;tily to a marriage with a man, of whom &s;he had little knowledge, and to who&s;e fa|mily and connections &s;he had no &s;ort of intro|duction. At length, &s;he entreated he would drop the &s;ubject, and the conver&s;ation for the remainder of the day was more general, yet &s;till intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>That &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and opinion, which had at fir&s;t attracted them, every moment now more fully di&s;clo&s;ed. Their di&s;cour&s;e was enriched by elegant litera|ture, and endeared by mutual regard: Adeline had enjoyed few opportunities of reading, but the books to which &s;he had acce&s;s, operating upon a mind eager for knowledge, and upon a ta&s;te pecu|liarly &s;en&s;ible of the beautiful and the ele|gant, had impre&s;&s;ed all their excellencies upon her under&s;tanding. Theodore had re|ceived from nature many of the qualities of genius, and from education all that it could be&s;tow; to the&s;e were added, a noble inde|pendency of &s;pirit, a feeling heart, and man|ners, which partook of a happy mixture of dignity and &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the evening, one of the officers, who, upon the repre&s;entation of the &s;erjeant, was &s;ent by the per&s;ons employed to pro&s;ecute military criminals, arrived at the village,
<PB N="35" REF="34">
and entering the apartment of Theodore, from which Adeline immediately withdrew, informed him, with an air of infinite impor|tance, that he &s;hould &s;et out on the following day for head-quarters. Theodore an&s;wered, that he was not able to bear the journey, and referred him to his phy&s;ician; but the officer replied that he &s;hould take no &s;uch trouble, it being certain that the phy&s;ician might be in&s;tructed what to &s;ay, and that he &s;hould begin his journey on the morrow. <Q REND="inline">"Here has been delay enough,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"already, and you will have &s;ufficient bu|&s;ine&s;s on your hands when you reach head-quarters; for the &s;erjeant, whom you have &s;everely wounded, intends to appear again&s;t you; and this, with the offence you have committed by de&s;erting your po&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Theodore's eyes fla&s;hed fire, <Q REND="inline">"De&s;ert|ing!"</Q> &s;aid he, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, and darting a look of menace at his ac|cu&s;er, <Q REND="inline">"who dares to brand me with the name of de&s;erter?"</Q> But in&s;tantly re|collecting how much his conduct had ap|peared to ju&s;tify the accu&s;ation, he en|deavoured to &s;tifle his emotions, and, with a firm voice and compo&s;ed manner, &s;aid, that when he reached head-quarters, he &s;hould beready to an&s;wer whatever might be brought again&s;t him, but that till then he
<PB N="36" REF="35">
&s;hould be &s;ilent. The boldne&s;s of the officer was repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;pirit and dignity with which Theodore &s;poke the&s;e words, and mut|tering a reply, that was &s;carcely audible, he left the room.</P>
<P>Theodore &s;at mu&s;ing on the danger of his &s;ituation: he knew that he had much to apprehend from the peculiar circum|&s;tances attending his abrupt departure from his regiment, it having been &s;tationed in a garri&s;on town upon the Spani&s;h fron|tiers; where the di&s;cipline was very &s;evere, and from the power of his colonel, the Marquis de Montalt, whom pride and di&s;ap|pointment would now rou&s;e to vengeance, and, probably, render indefatigable in the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;truction. But his thoughts &s;oon fled from his own danger to that of Adeline, and, in the con&s;ideration of this, all his fortitude for&s;ook him: he could not &s;upport the idea of leaving her ex|po&s;ed to the evils he foreboded, nor, indeed, of a &s;eparation &s;o &s;udden as that which now threatened him; and when &s;he again en|tered the room, he renewed his &s;olicitati|ons for a &s;peedy marriage, with all the arguments that tenderne&s;s and ingenuity could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Adeline, when &s;he learned that he was to depart on the morrow, felt as if bereaved of her la&s;t comfort. All the horrors of his
<PB N="37" REF="36">
&s;ituation aro&s;e to her mind, and &s;he turned from him in unutterable angui&s;h. Con&s;ider|ing her &s;ilence as a favourable pre&s;age, he repeated his entreaties that &s;he would con&s;ent to be his, and thus give him a &s;urety that their &s;eparation &s;hould not be eternal. Ade|line &s;ighed deeply to the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"And who can know that our &s;eparation will <HI>not</HI> be eternal,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"even if I could con&s;ent to the marriage you pro|po&s;e? But while you hear my deter|mination, forbear to accu&s;e me of in|difference, for indifference towards you would, indeed, be a crime, after the &s;ervices you have rendered me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is a cold &s;entiment of gratitude all that I mu&s;t expect from you?"</Q> &s;aid Theodore. <Q REND="inline">"I know that you are going to di&s;tre&s;s me with a proof of your in|difference, which you mi&s;take for the &s;ugge&s;tions of prudence; and that I &s;hall be compelled to look, without reluctance, upon the evils that may &s;hortly await me. Ah, Adeline! if you mean to reject this, perhaps, the la&s;t propo&s;al which I can ever make to you, cea&s;e, at lea&s;t, to deceive your&s;elf with an idea that you love me; that delirium is fading even from my mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you then &s;o &s;oon forg t our con|ver&s;ation of this morning?"</Q> replied
<PB N="38" REF="37">
Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"and can you think &s;o lightly of me as to believe I would profe&s;s a re|gard, which I do not feel? If, indeed, you can believe this, I &s;hall do well to for|get that I ever made &s;uch an acknowledge|ment, and you, that you heard it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Forgive me, Adeline, forgive the doubts and incon&s;i&s;tencies I have be|trayed: let the anxieties of love, and the emergency of my circum&s;tances, plead for me."</Q> Adeline, &s;miling faintly through her tears, held out her hand, which he &s;eized and pre&s;&s;ed to his lips. <Q REND="inline">"Yet do not drive me to de&s;pair by a rejection of my &s;uit,"</Q> continued Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"think what I mu&s;t &s;uffer to leave you here de&s;titute of friends and protection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am thinking how I may avoid a &s;itua|tion &s;o deplorable,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"They &s;ay there is a convent, which receives boarders, within a few miles, and thither I wi&s;h to go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A convent!"</Q> rejoined Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"would you go to a convent? Do you know the per&s;ecutions you would be liable to; and that if the Marquis &s;hould di&s;cover you, there is little probability the &s;uperior would re&s;i&s;t his authority, or, at lea&s;t, his bribes?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All this I have con&s;idered,"</Q> &s;aid
<PB N="39" REF="38">
Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"and am prepared to encounter it, rather than enter into an engagement, which, at this time, can be productive only of mi&s;ery to us both."</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline">"Ah, Adeline! could you think thus, if you truly loved? I &s;ee my&s;elf about to be &s;eparated, and that, perhaps, for ever, from the object of my ten|dere&s;t affections&mdash;and I cannot but expre&s;s all the angui&s;h I feel&mdash;I can|not forbear to repeat every argument that may afford even the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;|&s;ibility of altering your determination. But <HI>you,</HI> Adeline, <HI>you</HI> look with complacency upon a circum&s;tance which tortures <HI>me</HI> with de&s;pair."</Q>
<P>Adeline, who had long &s;trove to &s;upport her &s;pirits in his pre&s;ence, while &s;he adhered to a reolution which rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted, but which the pleadings of her heart powerfully oppo&s;ed, was unable longer to command her di&s;tre&s;s, and bur&s;t into tears. Theodore was in the &s;ame moment convinced of his error, and &s;hocked at the grief he had occa|&s;ioned. He drew his chair towards her, and, taking her hand, again entreated her pardon, and endeavoured in the tendere&s;t accents to &s;oothe and comfort her.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What a wretch was I to cau&s;e you this di&s;tre&s;s, by que&s;|tioning that with regard which I can no longer doubt you honour me! Forgive me,
<PB N="40" REF="39">
Adeline; &s;ay but you forgive me, and, whatever may be the pain of this &s;epara|tion, I will no longer oppo&s;e it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have given me &s;ome pain,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"but you have not offended me."&mdash;</Q>She then mentioned &s;ome farther par|ticulars concerning the convent. Theodore endeavoured to conceal the di&s;tre&s;s which the approaching &s;eparation occa&s;ioned him, and to con&s;ult with her on the&s;e plans with compo&s;ure. His judgment by degrees pre|vailed over his pa&s;&s;ions, and he now per|ceived that the plan &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted would afford her be&s;t chance of &s;ecurity. He con|&s;idered, what in the fir&s;t agitation of his mind had e&s;caped him, that he might be condemned upon the charges brought again&s;t him, and that his death, &s;hould they have been married, would not only deprive her of her protector, but leave her more immediate|ly expo&s;ed to the de&s;igns of the Marquis, who would, doubtle&s;s, attend his trial. A&s;toni&s;hed that he had not noticed this be|fore, and &s;hocked at the unwarine&s;s by which he might have betrayed her into &s;o dangerous a &s;ituation, he became at once reconciled to the idea of leaving her in a convent. He could have wi&s;hed to place her in the a&s;ylum of his own family, but the circum&s;tances under which &s;he mu&s;t be introduced were &s;o awkward and painful,
<PB N="41" REF="40">
and, above all, the di&s;tance at which they re&s;ided, would render a journey &s;o highly dangerous for her, that he forbore to pro|po&s;e it. He entreated only that &s;he would allow him to write to her; but recollecting that his letters might be a means of betray|ing the place of her re&s;idence to the Mar|quis, he checked him&s;elf: <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t deny my&s;elf even this melancholy plea&s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"le&s;t my letters &s;hould di&s;cover your abode; yet how &s;hall I be able to endure the impatience and uncertainty to which prudence condemns me! If you are in danger, I &s;hall be ignorant of it; though, indeed, did I know it,"</Q> &s;aid he with a look of de&s;pair, <Q REND="inline">"I could not fly to &s;ave you. O exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery! 'tis now only I perceive all the horrors of con|finement&mdash;'tis now only that I under|&s;tand all the value of liberty!"</Q></P>
<P>His utterance was interrupted by the violent agitation of his mind; he ro&s;e from his chair, and walked with quick paces about the room. Adeline &s;at, overcome by the de&s;cription which Theodore had given of his approaching &s;ituation, and by the con&s;ideration that &s;he might remain in the mo&s;t terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning his fate. She &s;aw him in a pri|&s;on&mdash;pale&mdash;emaciated, and in chains:&mdash;&s;he &s;aw all the vengeance of the Marquis de&s;|cending upon him; and this for his noble
<PB N="42" REF="41">
exertions in her cau&s;e. Theodore, alarmed by the placid de&s;pair expre&s;&s;ed in her counte|nance, threw him&s;elf into a chair by her's, and, taking her hand, attempted to &s;peak comfort to her, but the words faltered on his lips, and he could only bathe her hand with tears.</P>
<P>This mournful &s;ilence was interrupted by the arrival of the carriage at the inn, and Theodore, ari&s;ing, went to the window that opened into the yard. The darkne&s;s of the night prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing the objects without, but a light now brought from the hou&s;e &s;hewed him a carriage and four, attended by &s;everal &s;ervants. Pre&s;ently he &s;aw a gen|tleman, wrapped up in a roquelaure, alight and enter the inn, and in the next moment he heard the voice of the Marquis.</P>
<P>He had &s;lown to &s;upport Adeline, who was &s;inking with terror, when the door opened, and the Marquis, followed by the officers and &s;everal &s;ervants, entered. Fury fla&s;hed from his eyes, as they glanced upon Theodore, who hung over Adeline with a look of fearful &s;oli|citude&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Seize that traitor,"</Q> &s;aid he, tur|ning to the officers; <Q REND="inline">"why have you &s;uffered him to remain here &s;o long?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am no traitor,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, with a firm voice, and the dignity of con&s;cious worth, <Q REND="inline">"but a defender of innocence, of
<PB N="43" REF="42">
one whom the treacherous Marquis de Montalt would de&s;troy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Obey your orders,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis to the officers. Adeline &s;hrieked, held fa&s;ter by Theodore's arm, and entreated the men not to part them. <Q REND="inline">"Force only can effect it,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, as he looked round for &s;ome in&s;trument of defence, but he could &s;ee none, and in the &s;ame moment they &s;urrounded and &s;eized him. <Q REND="inline">"Dread every thing from my vengeance,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis to Theo|dore, as he caught the hand of Adeline, who had lo&s;t all power of re&s;i&s;tance, and was &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of what pa&s;&s;ed; <Q REND="inline">"dread every thing from my vengeance; you know you have de&s;erved it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I defy your vengeance,"</Q> cried Theo|dore, <Q REND="inline">"and dread only the pangs of con&s;cience, which your power cannot inflict upon me, though your vices con|demn you to its tortures."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Take him in&s;tantly from the room, and &s;ee that he is &s;trongly fettered,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"he &s;hall &s;oon know what a criminal, who adds in&s;olence to guilt, may &s;uffer."&mdash;</Q>Theodore exclaiming. <Q REND="inline">"Oh Adeline! farewell!"</Q> was now forced out of the room; while Adeline, who&s;e tor|pid &s;en&s;es were rou&s;ed by his voice and his la&s;t looks, fell at the feet of the Marquis, and with tears of agony implored compa&s;&s;ion for
<PB N="44" REF="43">
Theodore: but her pleadings for his rival &s;erved only to irritate the pride and exa&s;pe|rate the hatred of the Marquis. He de|nounced vengeance on his head, and im|precations too dreadful for the &s;pirits of Ade|line, whom he compelled to ri&s;e; and then, endeavouring to &s;tifle the emotlons of rage, which the pre&s;ence of Theodore had excit|ed, he began to addre&s;s her with his u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ions of admiration.</P>
<P>The wretched Adeline, who, regardle&s;s of what he &s;aid, &s;till continued to plead for her unhappy lover, was at length alarm|ed by the returning rage which the counte|nance of the Marquis expre&s;&s;ed, and, ex|erting all her remaining &s;trength, &s;he &s;prung from his gra&s;p towards the door of the room; but he &s;eized her hand before &s;he could reach it, and, regardle&s;s of her &s;hrieks, bring|ing her back to her chair, was going to &s;peak, when voices were heard in the pa&s;|&s;age, and immediately the landlord and his wife, whom Adeline's cries had alarmed, entered the apartment. The Marquis, turn|ing furiou&s;ly to them, demanded what they wanted; but not waiting for their an|&s;wer, he bade them attend him, and quit|ting the room, &s;he heard the door locked upon her.</P>
<P>Adeline now ran to the windows, which were unfa&s;tened, and opened into the inn-<PB N="45" REF="44">
yard.
All was dark and &s;ilent. She call|ed aloud for help, but no per&s;on appeared; and the windows were &s;o high, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape una&s;&s;i&s;ted. She walked about the room in an agony of terror and di&s;tre&s;s, now &s;topping to li&s;ten, and fancy|ing &s;he heard voices di&s;puting below, and now quickening her &s;teps, as &s;u&s;pen&s;e in|crea&s;ed the agitation of her mind.</P>
<P>She had continued in this &s;tate for near half an hour, when &s;he &s;uddenly heard a violent noi&s;e in the lower part of the hou&s;e, which increa&s;ed till all was uproar and con|fu&s;ion. People pa&s;&s;ed quickly through the pa&s;&s;ages, and doors were frequently opened and &s;hut. She called, but received no an|&s;wer. It immediately occurred to her, that Theodore, having heard her &s;creams, had attempted to come to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that the bu&s;tle had been occa&s;ioned by the oppo&s;ition of the officers. Knowing their fiercene&s;s and cruelty, &s;he was &s;eized with dreadful apprehen&s;ions for the life of Theo|dore.</P>
<P>A confu&s;ed uproar of voices now &s;ounded from below, and the &s;creams of women convinced her there was fighting; &s;he even thought &s;he heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words; the image of Theodore, dying by the hands of the Marquis, now ro&s;e to her imagina|tion, and the terrors of &s;u&s;pen&s;e became
<PB N="46" REF="45">
almo&s;t in&s;upportable. She made a de&s;perate effort to force the door, and again called for help, but her trembling hands were powerle&s;s, and every per&s;on in the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be too much engaged even to hear her. A loud &s;hriek now pierced her ears, and, amid&s;t the tumult that followed, &s;he clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed deep groans. This confirmation of her fears deprived her of all her remaining &s;pirits, and growing faint, &s;he &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s into a chair near the door. The uproar gradually &s;ub&s;ided till all was &s;till, but nobody returned to her. Soon after &s;he heard voices in the yard, but &s;he had no power to walk acro&s;s the room, even to a&s;k the que&s;tions &s;he wi&s;hed, yet &s;eared, to have an&s;wered.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour elap&s;ed, when the door was unlocked, and the ho&s;te&s;s appeared with a countenanee as pale as death. <Q REND="inline">"For God's &s;ake,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"tell me what has happened? Is he wounded? Is he killed?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is not dead, Ma'am&s;elle, but&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is dying then?&mdash;tell me where he is&mdash;let me go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Stop, Ma'am&s;elle,"</Q> cried the ho&s;te&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"you are to &s;tay here, I only want the hart&s;horn out of that cupboard there."</Q> Adeline tried to e&s;cape by the door, but
<PB N="47" REF="46">
the ho&s;te&s;s, pu&s;hing her a&s;ide, locked it, and went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Adeline's di&s;tre&s;s now entirely overcame her, and &s;he &s;at motionle&s;s, and &s;carcely con&s;cious that &s;he exi&s;ted, till rou&s;ed by a &s;ound of foot&s;teps near the door, which was again opened, and three men, whom &s;he knew to be the Marquis's &s;ervants, entered. She had &s;ufficient recollection to repeat the que&s;tions &s;he had a&s;ked the land|lady, but they an&s;wered only that &s;he mu&s;t come with them, and that a chai&s;e was wait|ing for her at the door. Still &s;he urged her que&s;tions. <Q REND="inline">"Tell me if he lives,"</Q> cried &s;he.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'am&s;elle, he is alive, but he is terribly wounded, and the &s;urgeon is ju&s;t come to him."</Q> As they &s;poke they hurried her along the pa&s;&s;age, and without noticing her entreaties and &s;upplications to know whither &s;he was going, they had reached the foot of the &s;tairs, when her cries brought &s;everal people to the door. To the&s;e the ho&s;te&s;s related, that the lady was the wife of a gentleman ju&s;t arrived, who had overtaken her in her &s;light with a gallant; and account which the Marquis's &s;ervants corroborated. <Q REND="inline">"'Tis the gentleman who has ju&s;t fought the duel,"</Q> added the ho&s;te&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"and it was on her ac|count."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">
Adeline, partly di&s;daining to take any notice of this artful &s;tory, and partly from her de&s;ire to know the particulars of what had happened, contented her&s;elf with repeat|ing her inquiries; to which one of the &s;pectators at la&s;t replied, that the gentleman was de&s;perately wounded. The Marquis's people would now have hurried her into the chai&s;e, but &s;he &s;unk lifele&s;s in their arms, and her condition &s;o intere&s;ted the humanity of the &s;pectators, that, notwith|&s;tanding their belief of what had been &s;aid, they oppo&s;ed the effort made to carry her, &s;en&s;ele&s;s as &s;he was, into the carriage.</P>
<P>She was at length taken into a room, and, by proper applications, re&s;tored to her &s;en&s;es. There &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly be&s;ought an explanation of what had happened, that the ho&s;te&s;s acquainted her with &s;ome par|ticulars of the late rencounter. <Q REND="inline">"When the gentleman that was ill heard your &s;creams, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"he became quite outrageous, as they tell me, and nothing could pacify him. The Marquis, for they &s;ay he is a Marquis, but you know be&s;t, was then in the room with my hu&s;band and I, and when he heard the uproar, he went down to &s;ee what was the matter; and when he came into the room where the Captain was, he found him &s;truggling with the &s;er|jeant.
<PB N="49" REF="48">
Then the Captain was more outrageous than ever; and notwith|&s;tanding he had one leg chained, and no &s;word, he contrived to get the &s;er|jeant's cutla&s;s out of the &s;cabbard, and immediately flew at the Marquis, and wounded him de&s;perately; upon which he was &s;ecured."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"It is the Marquis then who is wounded,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"the other gentleman is not hurt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not he,"</Q> replied the ho&s;te&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"but he will &s;mart for it by and bye, for the Marquis &s;wears he will do for him."</Q> Adeline, for a moment, forgot all her mi&s;|fortunes and all her danger in thankfulne&s;s for the immediate e&s;cape of Theodore; and &s;he was proceeding to make &s;ome farther inquiries concerning him, when the Mar|quis's &s;ervants entered the room, and declar|ed they could wait no longer. Adeline, now awakened to a &s;en&s;e of the evils with which &s;he was threatened, endea|voured to win the pity of the ho&s;te&s;s, who, however, was, or affected to be, convinced of the truth of the Marquis's &s;tory, and, therefore, in&s;en&s;ible to all &s;he could urge. Again &s;he addre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants, but in vain; they would nei|ther &s;uffer her to remain longer at the inn, or inform her whither &s;he was going; but, in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal per&s;ons,

already prejudiced by the injurious a&s;|&s;ertions of the ho&s;te&s;s, Adeline was hur|ried into the chai&s;e, and her conductors mounting their hor&s;es, the whole party was very &s;oon beyond the village.</P>
<P>Thus ended Adeline's &s;hare of an ad|venture, begun with a pro&s;pect not only of &s;ecurity, but of happine&s;s; an ad|venture, which had attached her more clo&s;ely to Theodore, and &s;hewn him to be more worthy of her love; but which, at the &s;ame time, had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her by new di&s;appointment, produced the im|pri&s;onment of her generous and now|adored lover, and delivered both him|&s;elf and her into the power of a rival, irritated by delay, contempt, and oppo|&s;ition.</P>

<P>THE &s;urgeon of the place, having examin|ed the Marquis's wound, gave him an immediate opinion upon it, and ordered
<PB N="51" REF="50">
that he &s;hould be put to bed: but the Mar|quis, ill as he was, had &s;carcely any other apprehen&s;ion than that of lo&s;ing Adeline, and declared he &s;hould be able to begin his journey in a few hours. With this in|tention, he had began to give orders for keeping hor&s;es in readine&s;s, when the &s;urgeon per&s;i&s;ting mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly, and even pa&s;&s;ionately to exclaim, that his life would be the &s;acrifice of his ra&s;hne&s;s, he was carried to a bed-chamber, where his valet alone was permitted to attend him.</P>
<P>This man, the convenient confidant of all his intrigues, had been the chief in&s;trument in a&s;&s;i&s;ting his de&s;igns con|cerning Adeline, and was indeed the very per&s;on who had brought her to the Marquis's villa on the borders of the fore&s;t. To him the Marquis gave his farther directions concerning her; and, fore&s;eeing the inconvenience, as well as the danger of detaining her at the inn, he had ordered him, with &s;everal other &s;ervants, to carry her away immediately in a hired carriage. The valet having gone to execute his orders, the Marquis was left to his own reflections, and to the violence of contending pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The reproaches and continued oppo|&s;ition of Theodore, the favoured lover of Adeline, exa&s;perated his pride, and
<PB N="52" REF="51">
rou&s;ed all his malice. He could not for a moment con&s;ider this oppo&s;ition, which was in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ucce&s;sful, without feeling an exce&s;s of indignation and inveteracy, &s;uch as the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy revenge could alone enable him to &s;upport.</P>
<P>When he had di&s;covered Adeline's e&s;cape from the villa, his &s;urprize at fir&s;t equalled his di&s;appointment; and, after exhau&s;ting the paroxy&s;ms of his rage upon his dome&s;tics, he di&s;patched them all different ways in pur&s;uit of her, going him&s;elf to the abbey, in the faint hope, that, de&s;titute as &s;he was of other &s;uccour, &s;he might have fled thither. La Motte, however, being as much &s;urprized as him&s;elf, and as ignorant of rhe route which Adeline had taken, he returned to the villa, impa|tient of intelligence, and found &s;ome of his &s;ervants arrived, without any news of Adeline, and tho&s;e who came afterwards were as &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A few days after, a letter from the Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment in|formed him, that Theodore had quitted his company, and had been for &s;ome time ab&s;ent, nobody knew where. This in|formation, confirming a &s;u&s;picion which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ad frequently occurred to him, that Theodore, had been by &s;ome means, or
<PB N="53" REF="52">
other, in&s;trumental in the e&s;cape of Adeline, all his other pa&s;&s;ions became for a time &s;ub&s;ervient to his revenge, and he gave or|ders for the immediate pur&s;uit and appre|hen&s;ion of Theodore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> but Theodore, in the mean time, had been overtaken and &s;ecured.</P>
<P>It was in con&s;equence of having formerly ob&s;erved the growing partiality between him and Adeline, and of intelligence received from La Motte, who had noticed their in|terview in the fore&s;t, that the Marquis had re&s;olved to remove a rival &s;o dangerous to his love, and &s;o likely to be informed of his de&s;igns. He had therefore told Theodore, in a manner as plau&s;ible as he could, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to join the re|giment; a notice which affected him only as it related to Adeline, and which &s;eemed the le&s;s extraordinary, as he had already been at the villa a much longer time than was u&s;ual with the officers invited by the Marquis. Theodore, indeed, very well knew the character of the Marquis, and had accepted his invitation rather from an un|willingne&s;s to &s;hew any di&s;re&s;pect to his Colonel by a refu&s;al, than from a &s;anguine expectation of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From the men who had apprehended Theo|dore, the Marquis received the information, which had enabled him to pur&s;ue and
<PB N="54" REF="53">
recover Adeline; but, though he had now ef|fected this, he was internally a prey to the corro&s;ive effects of di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ion and exa&s;perated pride. The angui&s;h of his wound was almo&s;t forgotten in that of his mind, and every pang he felt &s;eemed to encrea&s;e his thir&s;t of revenge, and to recoil with new tor|ture upon his heart. While he was in this &s;tate, he heard the voice of the innocent Adeline imploring protection; but her cries excited in him neither pity or remor&s;e; and when, &s;oon after, the carriage drove away, and he was certain both that &s;he was &s;ecured and Theodore was wretched, he &s;eemed to feel &s;ome ce&s;&s;ation of mental pain.</P>
<P>Theodore, indeed, did &s;uffer all that a vir|tuous mind, labouring under oppre&s;&s;ion &s;o &s;evere, could feel; but he was, at lea&s;t, free from tho&s;e inveterate and malignant pa&s;&s;ions which tore the bo&s;om of the Marquis, and which inflict upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a puni&s;h|ment more &s;evere than any they can prompt him to imagine for another. What indig|nation he might feel towards the Marquis, was at this time &s;econdary to his anxiety for Adeline. His captivity was painful, as it pre|vented his &s;eeking a ju&s;t and honourable re|venge; but it was dreadful, as it withheld him from attempting the re&s;cue of her whom he loved more than life.</P>
<P>When he heard the wheels of the carriage
<PB N="55" REF="54">
that contained her drive off, he felt an agony of de&s;pair which almo&s;t overcame his rea&s;on. Even the &s;tern hearts of the &s;oldiers who at|tended him were not wholly in&s;en&s;ible to his wretchedne&s;s, and by venturing to blame the conduct of the Marquis, they endea|voured to con&s;ole their pri&s;oner. The phy|&s;ician, who was ju&s;t arrived, entered the room during this paroxy&s;m of his di&s;tre&s;s, and, both feeling and expre&s;&s;ing much con|cern at his condition, inquired with &s;trong &s;urprize why he had been thus precipitately removed to a room &s;o very unfit for his re|ception?</P>
<P>Theodore explained to him the rea&s;on of this, of the di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered, and of the chains by which he was di&s;graced; and per|ceiving the phy&s;ician li&s;tened to him with attention and compa&s;&s;ion, he became de&s;i|rous of acquainting him with &s;ome farther particulars, for which purpo&s;e he de&s;ired the &s;oldiers to leave the room. The men, com|plying with his reque&s;t, &s;tationed them&s;elves on the out&s;ide of the door.</P>
<P>He then related all the particulars of the late tran&s;action, and of his connection with the Marquis. The phy&s;ician attended to his narrative with deep concern, and his countenance frequently expre&s;&s;ed &s;trong agita|tion. When Theodore concluded, he remained for &s;ome time &s;ilent and lo&s;t in thought; at
<PB N="56" REF="55">
length, awaking from his reverie, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I fear your &s;ituation is de&s;perate. The character of the Marquis is too well known to &s;uffer him either to be loved or re&s;pected; from &s;uch a man you have nothing to hope, for he has &s;carcely any thing to fear. I wi&s;h it was in my power to &s;erve you, but I &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"my &s;itu|ation is indeed de&s;perate, and&mdash;for that &s;uffering angel"&mdash;</Q>deep &s;obs in|terrupted his voice, and the violence of his agitation would not allow him to proceed. The phy&s;ician could only expre&s;s the &s;ym|pathy he felt for his di&s;tre&s;s, and entreat him to be more calm, when a &s;ervant en|tered the room from the Marquis, who de|&s;ired to &s;ee the phy&s;ician immediately. After &s;ome time he &s;aid he would attend the Marquis, and having endeavoured to attain a degree of compo&s;ure, which he found it difficult to a&s;&s;ume, he wrung the hand of Theodore and quitted the room, pro|mi&s;ing to return before he left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He found the Marquis much agitated both in body and mind, and rather more ap|prehen&s;ive for the con&s;equences of the wound than he had expected. His anxi|ety for Theodore now &s;ugge&s;ted a plan, by the execution of which he hoped he might be able to &s;erve him. Having felt his pa|tient's
<PB N="57" REF="56">
pul&s;e, and a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions, he a&s;&s;umed a very &s;erious look, when the Marquis, who watched every turn of his countenance, de&s;ired he would without he|&s;itation, &s;peak his opinion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry to alarm you, my Lord, but here is &s;ome rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ion: how long is it &s;ince you received the wound?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God! there is danger then!"</Q> cried the Marquis, adding &s;ome bitter execrations again&s;t Theodore.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There certainly <HI>is</HI> danger;"</Q> replied the phy&s;i|cian, <Q REND="inline">"a few hours may enable me to de|termine its degree."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A few hours, Sir!"</Q> interrupted the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"a few hours!"</Q> The phy&s;ician entreated him to be more calm. <Q REND="inline">"Confu&s;ion!"</Q> cried the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"A man in health may, with great compo&s;ure, entreat a dying man to be calm. Theodore will be broke upon the wheel for it, however."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mi&s;take me, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the phy|&s;ician, <Q REND="inline">"if I believe you a dying man, or, indeed, <HI>very</HI> near death, I &s;hould not have &s;poken as I did. But it is of con&s;equence I &s;hould know how long the wound has been inflicted."</Q> The Marquis's terror now began to &s;ub&s;ide, and he gave a circum&s;tantial account of the affray with Theodore, repre&s;enting
<PB N="58" REF="57">
that he had been ba&s;ely u&s;ed in an affair, where his own conduct had been perfectly ju&s;t and humane. The phy&s;ician heard this relation with great coolne&s;s, and when it concluded, without making any comment upon it, told the Marquis he would pre&s;cribe a medicine, which he wi&s;hed him to take im|mediately.</P>
<P>The Marquis, again alarmed by the gra|vity of his manner, entreated he would de|clare mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly, whether he thought him in immediate danger. The phy&s;ician he&s;itated, and the anxiety of the Marquis increa&s;ed: <Q REND="inline">"It is of con&s;equence,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould know my exact &s;itua|tion."</Q> The phy&s;ician then &s;aid, that if he had any worldly affairs to &s;ettle, it would be as well to attend to them, for that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what might be the event.</P>
<P>He then turned the di&s;cour&s;e and &s;aid, he had ju&s;t been with the young officer under arre&s;t, who, he hoped, would not be removed at pre&s;ent, as &s;uch a procedure mu&s;t endanger his life. The Marquis uttered a dreadful oath, and, cur&s;ing Theodore for having brought him to his pre&s;ent condition, &s;aid, he &s;hould depart with the guard that very night. Again&s;t the cruelty of this &s;en|tence, the phy&s;ician ventured to expo&s;tulate; and endeavouring to awaken the Marquis to a &s;en&s;e of humanity, pleaded earne&s;tly for
<PB N="59" REF="58">
Theodore. But the&s;e entreaties and argu|ments &s;eemed, by di&s;playing to the Marquis a part of his own character, to rou&s;e his re|&s;entment, and re-kindle all the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician at length withdrew in de&s;|pondency, after promi&s;ing, at the Marquis's reque&s;t, not to leave the inn. He had hoped, by aggravating his danger, to obtain &s;ome advantages, both for Adeline and Theodore, but the plan had quite a contrary effect; for the apprehen&s;ion of death, &s;o dreadful to the guilty mind of the Marquis, in&s;tead of awaken|ing penitence, increa&s;ed his de&s;ire of ven|geance again&s;t the man, who had brought him to &s;uch a &s;ituation. He determined to have Adeline conveyed, where Theo|dore, &s;hould he by any accident e&s;cape, could never obtain her; and thus to &s;e|cure to him&s;elf, at lea&s;t, &s;ome means of revenge. He knew, however, that when Theodore was once &s;afely conveyed to his regiment, his de&s;truction was certain, for &s;hould he even be acquitted of the inten|tention of de&s;erting, he would be con|demned for having a&s;&s;aulted his &s;uperior officer.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician returned to the room where Theodore was confined. The violence of his di&s;tre&s;s was now &s;ub&s;ided into a &s;tern de&s;|pair, more dreadful than the vehemence
<PB N="60" REF="59">
which had lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him. The guard, in compliance with his reque&s;t, having left the room, the phy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ician repeated to him &s;ome part of his conver&s;ation with the Mar|quis. Theodore, after expre&s;&s;ing his thanks, &s;aid, he had nothing more to hope. For him&s;elf he felt little; it was for his family, and for Adeline he &s;uffered. He enquired what route &s;he had taken, and though he had no pro&s;pect of deriving advantage from the information, de&s;ired the phy&s;ician to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in obtaining it; but the landlord and his wife either were, or affected to be, ignorant of the matter, and it was in vain to apply to any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;erjeant now entered with orders from the Marquis for the immediate departure of Theodore, who heard the me&s;&s;age with com|po&s;ure, though the phy&s;ician could not help expre&s;&s;ing his indignation at this precipitate removal, and his dread of the con&s;equences that might attend it. Theodore had &s;carcely time to declare his gratitude for the kindne&s;s of this valuable friend, before the &s;oldiers entered the room to conduct him to the car|riage in waiting. As he bade him farewell, Theodore &s;lipped his pur&s;e into his hand, and turning abruptly away, told the &s;oldiers to lead on; but the phy&s;ician &s;topped him, and refu&s;ed the pre&s;ent with &s;uch &s;erious warmth, that he was compelled to re&s;ume
<PB N="61" REF="60">
it: he wrung the hand of his new friend, and, being unable to &s;peak, hurried away. The whole party immediately &s;et off, and the unhappy Theodore was left to the remem|brance of his pa&s;t hopes and &s;ufferings, to his anxiety for the fate of Adeline, the contem|plation of his pre&s;ent wretchedne&s;s, and the apprehen&s;ion of what might be re&s;erved for him in future. For him&s;elf, indeed, he &s;aw nothing but de&s;truction, and was only re|lieved from total de&s;pair, by a feeble hope that &s;he, whom he loved better than him&s;elf, might one time enjoy that happine&s;s, of which he did not venture to look for a parti|cipation.</P>

<P>MEANWHILE the per&s;ecuted Adeline continued to travel, with little interruption, all night. Her mind &s;uffered &s;uch a tumult of grief, regret, de&s;pair, and terror, that &s;he could not be &s;aid to think. The Marquis's valet, who had placed him&s;elf in the chai&s;e with her, at fir&s;t &s;eemed inclined to talk, but her inattention &s;oon &s;ilenced him, and left her to the indulgence of her own mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed to travel through ob&s;cure lanes and bye-ways, along which the car|riage drove as furiou&s;ly as the darkne&s;s would
<PB N="63" REF="62">
permit: when the dawn appeared, &s;he per|ceived her&s;elf on the borders of a fore&s;t, and renewed her entreaties to know whither &s;he was going. The man replied, he had no orders to tell, but &s;he would &s;oon &s;ee. Adeline, who had hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed they were carrying her to the villa, now began to doubt it; and as every place appeared le&s;s terrible to her imagination than that, her de&s;pair began to abate, and &s;he thought only of the devoted Theodore, whom &s;he knew to be the victim of malice and revenge.</P>
<P>They now entered upon the fore&s;t, and it occurred to her that &s;he was going to the abbey; for though &s;he had no remembrance of the &s;cenery, through which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, it was not the le&s;s probable that this was the fore&s;t of Fontangville, who&s;e boundaries were by much too exten&s;ive to have come within the circle of her former walks. This con|jecture revived a terror, little inferior to that occa&s;ioned by the idea of going to the villa, for at the abbey &s;he would be equal|ly in the power of the Marquis, and al&s;o in that of her cruel enemy, La Motte. Her mind revolted at the picture her fancy drew, and as the carriage moved under the &s;hades, &s;he threw from the window a look of eager inquiry for &s;ome object which might con|firm, or de&s;troy her pre&s;ent &s;urmi&s;e: &s;he did not long look, before an opening in the
<PB N="64" REF="63">
fore&s;t &s;hewed her the di&s;tant towers of the abbey&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am, indeed lo&s;t then!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon at the foot of the lawn, and Peter was &s;een running to open the gate, at which the carriage &s;topped. When he &s;aw Adeline, he looked &s;urprized and made an effort to &s;peak, but the chai&s;e now drove up to the abbey, where, at the door of the hall, La Motte him&s;elf appeared. As he advanced to take her from the carriage, an univer&s;al trembling &s;eized her; it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty &s;he &s;upported her|&s;elf, and for &s;ome moments &s;he neither ob|&s;erved his countenance, nor heard his voice. He offered his arm to a&s;&s;i&s;t her into the abbey, which &s;he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, but having totter|ed a few paces, was obliged to accept; they then entered the vaulted room, where, &s;inking into a chair, a flood of tears came to her relief. La Motte did not interrupt the &s;ilence, which continued for &s;ome time, but paced the room in &s;eeming agitation. When Adeline was &s;ufficiently recovered to notice external objects, &s;he ob&s;erved his counte|nance, and there read the tumult of his &s;oul, while he was &s;truggling to a&s;&s;ume a firmne&s;s, which his better feelings oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>La Motte now took her hand, and would have led her from the room, but &s;he &s;topped, and, with a kind of de&s;perate courage, made
<PB N="65" REF="64">
an effort to engage him to pity, and to &s;ave her. He interrupted her; <Q REND="inline">"It is not in my power,"</Q> &s;aid he, in a voice of emotion; <Q REND="inline">"I am not ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, or my conduct; inquire no farther&mdash;it is &s;ufficient for you to know that I pity you; more I cannot do."</Q> He gave her no time to re|ply, but, taking her hand, led her to the &s;tairs of the tower, and from thence to the chamber &s;he had formerly occupied.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here you mu&s;t remain for the pre|&s;ent,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"in a confinement, which is, perhaps, almo&s;t as involun|tary on my part as it can be on yours. I am willing to render it as ea&s;y as po&s;|ble, and have, therefore, ordered &s;ome books to be brought you."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline made an effort to &s;peak, but he hurried from the room, &s;eemingly a&s;hamed of the part he had undertaken, and unwil|ling to tru&s;t him&s;elf with her tears. She heard the door of the chamber locked, and then, looking towards the windows, per|ceived they were &s;ecured: the door that led to the other apartments was al&s;o fa&s;tened. Such preparation for &s;ecurity &s;hocked her, and, hopele&s;s as &s;he had long believed her|&s;elf, &s;he now perceived her mind to &s;ink deeper in de&s;pair. When the tears &s;he &s;hed had &s;omewhat relieved her, and her thoughts could turn from the &s;ubjects of
<PB N="66" REF="65">
her immediate concern, &s;he was thankful for the total &s;eclu&s;ion allotted her, &s;ince it would &s;pare her the pain &s;he mu&s;t feel in the pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, and allow the unre&s;trained indul|gence of her own &s;orrow and reflection; reflection which, however di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, was pre&s;erable to the agony inflicted on the mind, when agitated by care and fear, it is ob|liged to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of tranquil|lity.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour, her cham|ber door was unlocked, and Annette appear|ed with refre&s;hments and books: &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing Adeline again, but &s;eemed fearful of &s;peaking, knowing, probably, that it was contrary to the orders of La Motte, who, &s;he &s;aid, was waiting at the bottom of the &s;tairs. When Annette was gone, Adeline took &s;ome refre&s;hment, which was indeed nece&s;&s;ary; for &s;he had ta&s;ted nothing &s;ince &s;he left the inn. She was plea&s;ed, but not &s;urprized, that Ma|dame La Motte did not appear, who, it was evident, &s;hunned her from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own ungenerous conduct, a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, which offered &s;ome pre&s;umption, that &s;he was &s;till not wholly unfriendly to her. She reflected upon the words of La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"I am not ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, or my conduct,"</Q> and though they afforded her no hope, &s;he
<PB N="67" REF="66">
derived &s;ome comfort, poor as it was, from the belief that he pitied her. After &s;ome time &s;pent in mi&s;erable reflection and various conjectures, her long-agitated &s;pirits &s;eem|ed to demand repo&s;e, and &s;he laid down to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Adeline &s;lept quietly for &s;everal hours, and awoke with a mind refre&s;hed and tran|quillized. To prolong this temporary peace, and to prevent, therefore, the intru&s;ion of her own thoughts, &s;he examined the books La Motte had &s;ent her: among the&s;e &s;he found &s;ome that in happier times had elevated her mind and intere&s;ted her heart; their effect was now weakened, they were &s;till, however, able to &s;often for a time the &s;en&s;e of her mi&s;fortunes.</P>
<P>But this Lethean medicine to a wound|ed mind was but a temporary ble&s;&s;ing, the entrance of La Motte di&s;&s;olved the illu&s;ions of the page, and awakened her to a &s;en&s;e of her own &s;ituation. He came with food, and having placed it on the table, left the room without &s;peaking. Again &s;he endea|voured to read, but his appearance had bro|ken the enchantment&mdash;bitter reflection re|turned to her mind, and brought with it the image of Theodore&mdash;of Theodore lo&s;t to her for ever!</P>
<P>La Motte, mean while, experienced all the terrors that could be inflicted by a con|&s;cience
<PB N="68" REF="67">
not wholly hardened to guilt. He had been led on by pa&s;&s;ion to di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;and from di&s;&s;ipation to vice; but having once touched the borders of infamy, the progre&s;|&s;ive &s;teps followed each other fa&s;t, and he now &s;aw him&s;elf the pander of a villain, and the betrayer of an innocent girl, whom every plea of ju&s;tice and humanity called upon him to protect. He contemplated his picture&mdash;he &s;hrunk from it, but he could change its deformity only by an effort too nobly daring for a mind already effeminated by vice. He viewed the dangerous labyrinth into which he was led, and perceived, as if for the fir&s;t time, the progre&s;&s;ion of his guilt; from this labyrinth he weakly imagined far|ther guilt could alone extricate him. In|&s;tead of employing his mind upon the means of &s;aving Adeline from de&s;truction, and him|&s;elf from being in&s;trumental to it, he endea|voured only to lull the pangs of con&s;cience and to per&s;uade him&s;elf into a belief that he mu&s;t proceed in the cour&s;e he had begun. He knew him&s;elf to be in the power of the Marquis, and he dreaded that power more than the &s;ure, though di&s;tant puni&s;hment that awaits upon guilt. The honour of Ade|line and the quiet of his own con&s;cience he con&s;ented to barter for a few years of exi&s;|tence.</P>
<P>He was ignorant of the pre&s;ent illne&s;s of
<PB N="69" REF="68">
the Marquis, or he would have perceived that there was a chance of e&s;caping the threa|tened puni&s;hment at a price le&s;s enormous than infamy, and he would, perhaps, have endeavoured to &s;ave Adeline and him&s;elf by flight. But the Marquis, fore&s;eeing the po&s;|&s;ibility of this, had ordered his &s;ervants carefully to conceal the circum&s;tance which detained him, and to acquaint La Motte that he &s;hould be at the abbey in a few days, at the &s;ame time directing his valet to await him there. Adeline, as he expected, had neither inclination nor opportunity to men|tion it, and thus La Motte remained igno|rant of the circum&s;tance, which might have pre&s;erved him from farther guilt and Adeline from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t unwillingly had La Motte made his wife acquainted with the action, which had made him ab&s;olutely dependent upon the will of the Marquis, but the perturbation of his mind partly betrayed him: frequently in his &s;leep he muttered incoherent &s;entences, and frequently would &s;tart from his &s;lumber, and call, in pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation, upon Adeline. The&s;e in&s;tances of a di&s;turbed mind had alarmed and terrified Madame La Motte, who watched while he &s;lept and &s;oon gathered from his words a confu&s;ed idea of the Marquis's de&s;igns.</P>
<P>She hinted her &s;u&s;picions to La Motte,
<PB N="70" REF="69">
who reproved her for having entertained them, but his manner, in&s;tead of repre&s;|&s;ing, increa&s;ed her fears for Adeline; fears, which the conduct of the Marquis &s;oon confirmed. On the night that he &s;lept at the abbey, it had occurred to her, that whatever &s;cheme was in agitation would now mo&s;t probably be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and anxiety for Adeline made her &s;toop to a meanne&s;s, which, in other circum&s;tances, would have been de&s;picable. She quitted her room, and, concealing her&s;elf in an apartment ad|joining that in which &s;he had left the Marquis and her hu&s;band, li&s;tened to their di&s;cour&s;e. It turned upon the &s;ubject &s;he had expected, and di&s;clo&s;ed to her the full extent of their de&s;igns. Terrified for Adeline, and &s;hocked at the guilty weakne&s;s of La Motte, &s;he was for &s;ome time incapable of thinking, or de|termining how to proceed. She knew her hu&s;band to be under great obligation to the Marquis, who&s;e territory thus afforded him a &s;helter from the world, and that it was in the power of the former to betray him into the hands of his enemies. She believed al&s;o that the Marquis would do this, if provoked, yet &s;he thought, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, La Motte might find &s;ome way ofappea&s;ing the Marquis, without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to di&s;|honour. After &s;ome farther reflection, her mind became more compo&s;ed, and &s;he re|turned
<PB N="71" REF="70">
to her chamber, where La Motte &s;oon followed. Her &s;pirits, however, were not now in a &s;tate to encounter either his di&s;plea&s;ure, or his oppo&s;ition, which &s;he had too much rea&s;on to expect, whenever &s;he &s;hould mention the &s;ubject of her con|cern, and &s;he, therefore, re&s;olved not to notice it till the morrow.</P>
<P>On the morrow, &s;he told La Motte all he had uttered in his dreams, and mention|ed other circum&s;tances, which convinced him it was in vain any longer to deny the truth of her apprehen&s;ions. His wife then repre&s;ented to him how po&s;&s;ible it was to avoid the infamy, into which he was about to plunge, by quitting the territories of the Marquis, and pleaded &s;o warmly for Adeline, that La Motte, in &s;ullen &s;ilence, appeared to meditate upon the plan His thoughts were, however, very differently engaged. He was con&s;cious of having de|&s;erved from the Marquis a dreadful puni&s;h|ment, and knew that if he exa&s;perated him by refu&s;ing to acquie&s;ce with his wi&s;hes, he had little to expect from flight, for the eye of ju&s;tice and revenge would pur&s;ue him with indefatigable re&s;earch.</P>
<P>La Motte meditated how to break this to his wife, for he perceived that there was no other method of counteracting her vir|tuous compa&s;&s;ion for Adeline, and the dan|gerous
<PB N="72" REF="71">
con&s;equences to be expected from it, than by oppo&s;ing it with terror for his &s;afe|ty, and this could be done only by &s;hew|ing her the full extent of the evils that mu&s;t attend the re&s;entment of the Marquis. Vice had not yet &s;o entirely darkened his con|&s;cience, but that the blu&s;h of &s;hame &s;tained his cheek, and his tongue faltered when he would have told his guilt. At length, find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to mention particulars, he told her that, on account of an affair, which no entreaties &s;hould ever induce him to explain, his life was in the power of the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee the alternative,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"take your choice of evils, and, if you can, tell Adeline of her danger, and &s;acrifice my life to &s;ave her from a &s;itu|ation, which many would be ambitious to obtain."&mdash;</Q>Madame La Motte, con|demned to the horrible alternative of per|mitting the &s;eduction of innocence, or of dooming her hu&s;band to de&s;truction, &s;uffer|ed a di&s;traction of thought, which defied all controul. Perceiving, however, that an oppo&s;ition to the de&s;igns of the Marquis would ruin La Motte and avail Adeline little, &s;he determined to yield and endure in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>At the time when Adeline was planning her e&s;cape from the abbey, the &s;ignificant looks of Peter had led La Motte to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="73" REF="72">
the truth and to ob&s;erve them more clo&s;e|ly. He had &s;een them &s;eparate in the hall in apparent confu&s;ion, and had afterwards ob&s;erved them conver&s;ing together in the cloi&s;ters. Circum&s;tances &s;o unu&s;ual left him not a doubt that Adeline had di&s;covered her danger, and was concerting with Peter &s;ome means of e&s;cape. Affecting, there|fore, to be informed of the whole affair, he charged Peter with treachery towards him&s;elf, and threatened him with the ven|geance of the Marquis if he did not di&s;clo&s;e all he knew. The menace intimidated Pe|ter, and, &s;uppo&s;ing that all chance of a&s;|&s;i&s;ting Adeline was gone, he made a cir|cum&s;tantial confe&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to for|bear acquainting Adeline with the di&s;covery of the &s;cheme. In this promi&s;e he was &s;e|conded by inclination, for he feared to meet the di&s;plea&s;ure, which Adeline, believing he had betrayed her, might expre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the evening of the day, on which Adeline's intended e&s;cape was di&s;covered, the Marquis de&s;igned to come to the abbey, and it had been agreed that he &s;hould then take Adeline to his villa. La Motte had immediately perceived the advantage of per|mitting Adeline to repair, in the belief of being undi&s;covered, to the tomb. It would prevent much di&s;turbance and oppo&s;ition, and &s;pare him&s;elf the pain he mu&s;t feel in
<PB N="74" REF="73">
her pre&s;ence, when &s;he &s;hould know that he had betrayed her. A &s;ervant of the Mar|quis might go, at the appointed hour, to the tomb, and wrapt in the di&s;gui&s;e of night, might take her quietly thence in the character of Peter. Thus, without re&s;i&s;|tance, &s;he would be carried to the villa, nor di&s;cover her mi&s;take till it was too late to prevent its con&s;equence.</P>
<P>When the Marquis did arrive, La Motte, who was not &s;o much intoxicated by the wine he had drank, as to forget his pru|dence, informed him of what had happen|ed and what he had planned, and the Mar|quis approving it, his &s;ervant was made ac|quainted with the &s;ignal, which afterwards betrayed Adeline to his power.</P>
<P>A deep con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the unworthy neutrality &s;he had ob&s;erved in Adeline's con|cerns, made Madame La Motte anxiou&s;ly avoid &s;eeing her now that &s;he was again in the abbey. Adeline under&s;tood this conduct, and &s;he rejoiced that &s;he was &s;pared the an|gui&s;h of meeting her as an enemy, whom &s;he had once con&s;idered as a friend. Several days now pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude, in mi&s;erable retro&s;pection, and dreadful expectation. The perilous &s;ituation of Theodore was al|mo&s;t the con&s;tant &s;ubject of her thoughts. Often did &s;he breathe an agonizing wi&s;h for his &s;afety, and often look round the &s;phere
<PB N="75" REF="74">
of po&s;&s;ibility in &s;earch of hope: but hope had almo&s;t left the horizon of her pro&s;pect, and when it did appear, it &s;prung only from the death of the Marquis, who&s;e vengeance threatened mo&s;t certain de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Marquis, mean while, lay at the inn at Baux, in a &s;tate of very doubtful re|covery. The phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, nei|ther of whom he would di&s;mi&s;s, nor &s;uffer to leave the village, proceeded upon con|trary principles, and the good effect of what the one pre&s;cribed, was frequently counter|acted by the injudicious treatment of the other. Humanity alone prevailed on the phy&s;ician to continue his attendance. The malady of the Marquis was al&s;o heightened by the impatience of his temper, the ter|rors of death, and the irritation of his pa&s;|&s;ions. One moment he believed him&s;elf dy|ing, another he could &s;carcely be prevented from attempting to follow Adeline to the abbey. So various were the fluctuations of his mind, and &s;o rapid the &s;chemes that &s;uc|ceeded each other, that his pa&s;&s;ions were in a continual &s;tate of conflict. The phy|&s;ician attempted to per&s;uade him, that his recovery greatly depended upon tranquillity, and to prevail upon him to attempt, at lea&s;t, &s;ome command of his feelings, but he was &s;oon &s;ilenced, in hopele&s;s di&s;gu&s;t, by the impatient an&s;wers of the Marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75">
At length the &s;ervant, who had carried off Adeline, returned, and the Marquis having ordered him into his chamber, a&s;ked &s;o many que&s;tions in a breath, that the man knew not which to an&s;wer. At length he pulled a folded paper from his pocket, which he &s;aid had been dropped in the chai&s;e by Mademoi&s;elle Adeline, and as he thought his lord&s;hip would like to &s;ee it, he had ta|ken care of it. The Marquis &s;tretched forth his hand with eagerne&s;s and received a note addre&s;&s;ed to Theodore. On perceiving the &s;uper&s;cription, the agitation of jealous rage for a moment overcame him, and he held it in his hand unable to open it.</P>
<P>He, however, broke the &s;eal, and found it to be a note of inquiry, written by Adeline to Theodore during his illne&s;s, and which, from &s;ome accident &s;he had been prevented from &s;ending him. The tender &s;olicitude it expre&s;&s;ed for his recovery &s;tung the &s;oul of the Marquis, and drew from him a com|pari&s;on of her feelings on the illne&s;s of his rival and that of him&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"She could be &s;olicitous for his recovery,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"but for mine, &s;he only dreads it."</Q> As if willing to prolong the pain this little billet had excited, he then read it again. Again he cur&s;ed his fate and execrated his rival, giving him&s;elf up, as u&s;ual, to the tran|&s;ports of his pa&s;&s;ion. He was going to
<PB N="77" REF="76">
throw it from him, when his eyes caught the &s;eal, and he looked earne&s;tly at it. His anger &s;eemed now to have &s;ub&s;ided, he de|po&s;ited the note carefully in his pocket book, and was, for &s;ome time, lo&s;t in thought.</P>
<P>After many days of hopes and fears, the &s;trength of his con&s;titution overcame his ill|ne&s;s, and he was well enough to write &s;e|veral letters, one of which he immediately &s;ent off to prepare La Motte for his recep|tion. The &s;ame policy, which had prompt|ed him to conceal his illne&s;s from La Motte, now urged him to &s;ay, what he knew would not happen, that he &s;hould reach the abbey on the day after his &s;ervant. He repeated this injunction, that Adeline &s;hould be &s;trictly guarded, and renewed his pro|mi&s;es of reward for the future &s;ervices of La Motte.</P>
<P>La Motte, to whom each &s;ucceeding day had brought new &s;urprize and perplexity concerning the ab&s;ence of the Marquis, re|ceived this notice with unea&s;ine&s;s, for he had begun to hope that the Marquis had altered his intentions concerning Adeline, being either engaged in &s;ome new adven|ture, or obliged to vi&s;it his e&s;tates in &s;ome di&s;tant province: he would have been wil|ling thus to have got rid of an affair, which was to reflect &s;o much di&s;honour on him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77">
This hope was now vani&s;hed, and he directed Madame to prepare for the re|ception of the Marquis. Adeline pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e days in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which was now cheered by hope, and now darken|ed by de&s;pair. This delay &s;o much ex|ceeding her expectation, &s;eemed to prove that the illne&s;s of the Marquis was danger|rous; and when &s;he looked forward to the con&s;equences of his recovery, &s;he could not be &s;orry that it was &s;o. So odious was the idea of him to her mind, that &s;he would not &s;uffer her lips to pronounce his name, nor make the inquiry of Annette, which was of &s;uch con&s;equence to her peace.</P>
<P>It was about a week after the receipt of the Marquis's letter, that Adeline one day &s;aw from her window a party of hor&s;emen enter the avenue, and knew them to be the Marquis and his attendants. She re|tired from the window in a &s;tate of mind not to be de&s;cribed, and, &s;inking into a chair, was for &s;ome time &s;carcely con&s;cious of the objects around her. When &s;he had recovered from the fir&s;t terror, which his appearance excited, &s;he again tottered to the window; the party was not in &s;ight, but &s;he heard the trampling of hor&s;es, and knew that the Marquis had wound round to the great gate of the abbey. She ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven for &s;upport and
<PB N="79" REF="78">
protection, and her mind being now &s;ome|what compo&s;ed, &s;at down to wait the event.</P>
<P>La Motte received the Marquis with ex|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;urprize at his long ab&s;ence, and the latter, merely &s;aying he had been de|tained by illne&s;s, proceeded to enquire for Adeline. He was told &s;he was in her cham|ber, from whence &s;he might be &s;ummoned if he wi&s;hed to &s;ee her. The Marquis he|&s;itated, and at length excu&s;ed him&s;elf, but de&s;ired &s;he might be &s;trictly watched. <Q REND="inline">"Per|haps, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte &s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ling, <Q REND="inline">"Adeline's ob&s;tinacy has been too powerful for your pa&s;&s;ion; you &s;eem le&s;s intere&s;ted concerning her than formerly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! by no means,"</Q> replied the Mar|quis; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he intere&s;ts me if po&s;&s;ible more than ever; &s;o much, indeed, that I cannot have her too clo&s;ely guarded; and I, therefore, beg La Motte, that you will &s;uffer nobody to attend her, but when you can ob&s;erve them your&s;elf. Is the room where &s;he is confined &s;ufficiently &s;ecure?"</Q> La Motte a&s;&s;ured him it was; but at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h that &s;he was removed to the villa. <Q REND="inline">"If by any means,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he &s;hould contrive to e&s;cape, I know what I mu&s;t expect from your di&s;plea&s;ure; and this reflection keeps my mind in continual anxiety."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This removal cannot be at pre&s;ent,"</Q>
<PB N="80" REF="79">
&s;aid the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is &s;afer here, and you do wrong to di&s;turb your&s;elf with any apprehen&s;ion of her e&s;cape, if her chamber is really &s;o &s;ecure, as you re|pre&s;ent it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can have no motive for deceiving you, my Lord, in this point."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;u&s;pect you of any,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"guard her carefully and tru&s;t me, &s;he will not e&s;cape. I can rely upon my valet, and if you wi&s;h it, he &s;hall re|main here."</Q> La Motte thought there could be no occa&s;ion for him, and it was agreed that the man &s;hould go home.</P>
<P>The Marquis after remaining about half an hour in conver&s;ation with La Motte, left the abbey, and Adeline &s;aw him depart with a mixture of &s;urprize and thankfulne&s;s that almo&s;t overcame her. She had waited in mo|mentary expectation of being &s;ummoned to appear, and had been endeavouring to arm her&s;elf with re&s;olution to &s;upport his pre&s;ence. She had li&s;tened to every voice that &s;ounded from below, and at every &s;tep that cro&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age, her heart had palpitated with dread, left it &s;hould be La Motte coming to lead her to the Marquis. This &s;tate of &s;uffering had been prolonged almo&s;t beyond her power of enduring it, when &s;he heard voices under her window, and ri&s;ing, &s;aw the Marquis ride away. After giving
<PB N="81" REF="80">
way to the joy and thankfulne&s;s that &s;welled her heart, &s;he endeavoured to account for this circum&s;tance, which, con&s;idering what had pa&s;&s;ed, was certainly very &s;trange. It appeared, indeed, wholly inexplicable, and, after much fruitle&s;s inquiry, &s;he quitted the &s;ubject, endeavouring to per&s;uade her&s;elf that it could only portend good.</P>
<P>The time of La Motte's u&s;ual vi&s;itation now drew near, and Adeline expected it in the trembling hope of hearing that the Marquis had cea&s;ed his per&s;ecution; but he was, as u&s;ual, &s;ullen and &s;ilent, and it was not till he was about to quit the room, that Adeline had the courage to inquire, when the Mar|quis was expected again? La Motte, opening the door to depart, replied, <Q REND="inline">"On the following day,"</Q> and Adeline, whom fear and delicacy embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;aw &s;he could obtain no intelligence of Theodore but by a direct que&s;tion; &s;he looked earne&s;tly as if &s;he would have &s;poke, and he &s;topped, but &s;he blu&s;hed and was &s;till &s;ilent, till upon his again attempting to leave the room, &s;he faintly called him back.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would a&s;k,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"after that un|fortunate chevalier who has incurred the re&s;entment of the Marquis by endea|vouring to &s;erve me. Has the Marquis mentioned him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He has,"</Q> replied La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"and
<PB N="82" REF="81">
your indifference towards the Marquis is now fully explained."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Since I mu&s;t feel re&s;entment towards tho&s;e who injure me,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"I may &s;urely be allowed to be grateful to|wards tho&s;e who &s;erve me. Had the Marquis de&s;erved my e&s;teem, he would, probably, have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"this young hero, who, it &s;eems, has been brave enough to lift his arm again&s;t his Co|lonel, is taken care of, and, I doubt not, will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of the value of his quix|oti&s;m."</Q> Indignation, grief, and fear, &s;truggled in the bo&s;om of Adeline; &s;he di&s;|dained to give La Motte an opportunity of again pronouncing the name of Theodore; yet the uncertainty under which &s;he laboured, urged her to inquire, whether the Marquis had heard of him &s;ince he left Caux? <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"he has been &s;afely carried to his regimen, where he is con|fined till the Marquis can attend to appear again&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline had neither power nor inclination to inquire farther, and La Motte quitting the chamber, &s;he was left to the mi&s;ery he had renewed. Though this information contained no new circum&s;tance of misfor|tune, (for &s;he now heard confirmed what &s;he had always expected) a weight of new
<PB N="83" REF="82">
&s;orrow &s;eemed to fall upon her heart, and &s;he perceived that &s;he had uncon&s;ciou&s;ly cheri&s;hed a latent hope of Theodore's e&s;|cape before he reached the place of his de&s;ti|nation. All hope was now, however, gone; he was &s;uffering the mi&s;eries of a pri&s;on, and the tortures of apprehen&s;ion both for his own life and her &s;afety. She pictured to her&s;elf the dark damp dungeon where he lay, loaded with chains, and pale with &s;ick|ne&s;s and grief; &s;he heard him, in a voice that thrilled her heart, call upon her name, and rai&s;e his eyes to Heaven in &s;ilent &s;uppli|cation: &s;he &s;aw the angui&s;h of his counte|nance, the tears that fell &s;lowly on his cheek, and remembering, at the &s;ame time, the generous conduct that had brought him to this aby&s;s of mi&s;ery, and that it was for her &s;ake he &s;uffered, grie&s; re&s;olved it&s;elf into de&s;pair, her tears cea&s;ed to &s;low, and &s;he &s;unk &s;ilently into a &s;tate of dreadful torpor.</P>
<P>On the morrow the Marquis arrived, and departed as before. Several days then elap&s;ed, and he did not appear, till one evening, as La Motte and his wife were in their u&s;ual &s;itting-room, he entered, and conver&s;ed for &s;ometime upon general &s;ubjects, from which, however, he by degrees fell into a reverie, and, after a pau&s;e of &s;ilence, he ro&s;e and drew La Motte to the window. <Q REND="inline">"I would &s;peak with you alone,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<PB N="84" REF="83">
<Q REND="inline">"if you are at lei&s;ure; if not, another time will do."</Q> La Motte, a&s;&s;uring him he was perfectly &s;o, would have conducted him to another room, but the Marquis pro|po&s;ed a walk in the fore&s;t. They went out together, and when they had reached a &s;o|litary glade, where the &s;preading branches of the beech and oak deepened the &s;hades of twilight, and threw a &s;olemn ob&s;curity around, the Marquis turned to La Motte, and addre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your condition, La Motte, is un|happy; this abbey is a melancholy re&s;idence for a man like you fond of &s;ociety, and like you al&s;o qualified to adorn it."</Q> La Motte bowed <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h it was in my power to re&s;tore you to the world,"</Q> continued the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"perhaps, if I knew the particulars of the affair which has driven you from it, I might perceive that my intere&s;t could ef|fectually &s;erve you. I think I have heard you hint it was an affair of honour."</Q> La Motte was &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"I mean not to di&s;tre&s;s you, however; nor is it common curio|&s;ity that prompts this inquiry, but a &s;in|cere de&s;ire to befriend you. You have already informed me of &s;ome particulars of your misfortunes. I think the liberality of your temper led you into expences which you afterwards endeavoured to retrieve by gaming."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="84">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"'tis true that I di&s;&s;ipated the greater part of an affluent fortune in luxurious indulgen|ces, and that I afterwards took unworthy means to recover it: but I wi&s;h to be &s;pared upon this &s;ubject. I would, if po&s;|&s;ible, lo&s;e the remembrance of a tran&s;ac|tion which mu&s;t for ever &s;tain my charac|ter, and the rigorous effect of which, I fear, it is not in your power, my Lord, to &s;often"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may be mi&s;taken on this point,"</Q> replied the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"my intere&s;t at Court is by no means incon&s;iderable. Fear not from me any &s;everity of cen&s;ure; I am not at all inclined to judge har&s;hly of the faults of others. I well know how to allow for the emergency of circum&s;tances; and, I think, La Motte, you have hi|therto found me your friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And when you recollect, that I have forgiven a certain tran&s;action of late date&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is true, my Lord; and allow me to &s;ay, I have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your genero&s;ity. The tran&s;action you allude to is by far the wor&s;t of my life; and what I have to relate cannot, therefore, lower me in your opinion. When I had di&s;&s;ipated the greate&s;t part of my property in habits of
<PB N="86" REF="85">
voluptuous plea&s;ure, I had recour&s;e to gaming to &s;upply the means of continuing them. A run of good luck, for &s;ome time, enabled me to do this, and encourag|ing my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, I conti|nued in the &s;ame career of &s;ucce&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Soon after this a &s;udden turn of fortune de&s;troyed my hopes, and reduced me to the mo&s;t de&s;perate extremity. In one night my money was lowered to the &s;um of two hundred louis. The&s;e I re&s;olv|ed to &s;take al&s;o, and with them my life; for it was my re&s;olution not to &s;urvive their lo&s;s. Never &s;hall I forget the hor|rors of that moment on which hung my fate, nor the deadly angui&s;h that &s;eized my heart when my la&s;t &s;take was gone. I &s;tood for &s;ome time in a &s;tate of &s;tupe|faction, till rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of my mi&s;|fortune, my pa&s;&s;ion made me pour forth execrations on my more fortunate rivals, and act all the frenzy of de&s;pair. Dur|ing this paroxy&s;m of madne&s;s, a gentle|man, who had been a &s;ilent ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;ed, approached me.&mdash;You are unfortunate, Sir, &s;aid he.&mdash;I need not be informed of that, Sir, I replied.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have, perhaps, been ill u&s;ed, re|&s;umed he.&mdash;Yes, Sir, I am ruined, and, therefore, it may be &s;aid, I am ill u&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">
<Q REND="inline">"Do you know the people you have played with?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; but I have met them in the fir&s;t circles.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I am, probably, mi&s;taken, &s;aid he, and walked away. His la&s;t words rou&s;ed me, and rai&s;ed a hope that my mo|ney had not been fairly lo&s;t. Wi&s;hing for farther information, I went in &s;earch of the gentleman, but he had left the rooms; I, however, &s;tifled my tran&s;ports, return|ed to the table where I had lo&s;t my money, placed my&s;elf behind the chair of one of the per&s;ons who had won it, and clo&s;ely watched the game. For &s;ome time I &s;aw nothing that could confirm my &s;u&s;picions, but was at length convinced they were ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When the game was ended I called one of my adver&s;aries out of the room, and telling him what I had ob&s;erved, threatened in&s;tantly to expo&s;e him if he did not re&s;tore my property. The man was, for &s;ome time, as po&s;itive as my&s;elf; and, a&s;&s;uming the bully, threatened me with cha&s;ti&s;ement for my &s;candalous a&s;&s;ertions. I was not, however, in a &s;tate of mind to be frightened, and his manner &s;erved only to exa&s;perate my temper, already &s;ufficiently inflamed by mis&s;ortune. After retorting his threats, I was about to re|turn
<PB N="88" REF="87">
to the apartment we had left, and expo&s;e what had pa&s;&s;ed, when, with an in&s;idious &s;mile and a &s;oftened voice, he begged I would favour him with a few moments attention, and allow him to &s;peak with the gentleman his partner. To the latter part of his reque&s;t I he&s;itated, but, in the mean time, the gentleman him&s;elf entered the room. His partner related to him, in few words, what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and the terror that appeared in his countenance &s;ufficiently declared his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They then drew a&s;ide, and remained a few minutes in conver&s;ation together, after which they approached me with an offer, as they phra&s;ed it, of a compromi&s;e. I declared, however, again&s;t any thing of this kind, and &s;wore, nothing le&s;s than the whole &s;um I had lo&s;t &s;hould content me.&mdash;Is it not po&s;&s;ible, Mon&s;ieur, that you may be offered &s;omething as advan|tageous as the whole?&mdash;I did not under|&s;tand their meaning, but, after they had continued for &s;ome time to give di&s;tant hints of the &s;ame &s;ort, they proceeded to explain.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perceiving their characters wholly in my power, they wi&s;hed to &s;ecure my intere&s;t to their party, and, therefore, informing me, that they belonged to an a&s;&s;ociation
<PB N="89" REF="88">
of per&s;ons, who lived upon the folly and inexperience of others, they offered me a &s;hare in their concern. My fortunes were de&s;perate, and the propo&s;al now made me would not only produce an immediate &s;up|ply, but enable me to return to tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipated plea&s;ure, to which pa&s;&s;ion had at fir&s;t, and long habit after|wards, attached me. I clo&s;ed with the offer, and thus &s;unk from di&s;&s;ipation into infamy."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte pau&s;ed, as if the recollection of the&s;e times filled him with remor&s;e. The Marquis under&s;tood his feelings. <Q REND="inline">"You judge too rigorou&s;ly of your&s;elf,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"there are few per&s;ons, let their appear|ance of hone&s;ty be what it may, who, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, would have acted better than you have done. Had I been in your &s;ituation, I know not how I might have acted. That rigid virtue which &s;hall condemn you, may dignify it&s;elf with the appel ation of wi&s;dom, but I wi&s;h not to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; let it &s;till re&s;ide, where it generally is to be found, in the cold bo&s;oms of tho&s;e, who, wanting feel|ing to be men, dignify them&s;elves with the title of philo&s;ophers. But pray pro|ceed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Our &s;ucce&s;s was for &s;ome time unli|mited, for we held the wheel of fortune,
<PB N="90" REF="89">
and tru&s;ted not to her caprice. Thought|le&s;s and voluptuous by nature, my ex|pences fully kept pace with my income. An unlucky di&s;covery of the practices of our party was at length made by a young no|bleman, which obliged us to act for &s;ome time with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. It would be tedious to relate the particu|lars, which made us at length &s;o &s;u&s;pected, that the di&s;tant civility and cold re&s;erve of our acquaintance rendered the frequenting public a&s;&s;emblies both painful and unprofi|table. We turned our thoughts to other modes o obtaining money, and a &s;windling tran&s;action, in which I engaged, to a very large amount, &s;oon compelled me to leave Paris.

<P><Q REND="inline">"There are certain prejudices attached to the human mind,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis in a &s;low and &s;olemn voice, <Q REND="inline">"which it re|quires

<P><Q REND="inline">"Nature, uncontaminated by fal&s;e re|finement,"</Q> re&s;umed the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"every where acts alike in the great occurrences of life.

Even the poli&s;hed Italian, di&s;tracted by jealou&s;y, or tempted by a &s;trong circum&s;tance of advantage, draws his &s;tilletto, and ac|compli&s;hes his purpo&s;e. It is the fir&s;t

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am attending, my Lord, to your <HI>rea&s;oning.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There are, I repeat it,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"people of minds &s;o weak, as to &s;hrink from acts they have been accu&s;tomed to hold wrong, however advantageous. They never &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be guided by circum&s;tances, but fix for life upon a certain &s;tandard, from which they will, on no account, depart.

<P>He &s;aw him&s;elf entangled in the web which his own crimes had woven. Being in the power of the Marquis, he knew he mu&s;t either con&s;ent to the commi&s;&s;ion of a deed, from the enormity of which, depraved as he was, he &s;hrunk in horror, or &s;acrifice fortune, freedom, probably life it&s;elf, to the refu&s;al.

gradations from folly to vice, till he now &s;aw before him an aby&s;s of guilt which &s;tartled even the con&s;cience that &s;o long had &s;lumber|ed. The means of retreating were de&s;perate&mdash;to proceed was equally &s;o.</P>
<P>When he con&s;idered the innocence and the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of Adeline, her orphan &s;tate, her former affectionate conduct, and her confidence in his protection, his heart melted with compa&s;&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;s he had al|ready occa&s;ioned her, and &s;hrunk in terror from the deed he was urged to commit. But when, on the other hand, he contempla|ted the de&s;truction that threatened him from the vengeance of the Marquis, and then con|&s;idered the advantages that were offered him of favour, freedom, and probably fortune, terror and temptation contributed to over|come the pleadings of humanity, and &s;ilence the voice of con&s;cience. In this &s;tate of tu|multuous uncertainty he continued for &s;ome time &s;ilent, until the voice of the Marquis rou&s;ed him to a conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of at lea&s;t appearing to acquie&s;ce in his de&s;igns.</P>

The doors of her chamber and of the we&s;t tower were to be left open to corroborate this account, and many other circum&s;tances were to be contrived to con|firm the &s;u&s;picion.

<Q REND="inline">"Farewell, then, When we meet a|gain"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When we meet again,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"it will be done."</Q> He followed the Marquis to the Abbey, and having &s;een him mount his hor&s;e and wi&s;hed him a good night, he retired to his chamber, where he &s;hut him|&s;elf up.</P>
<P>Adeline, mean while, in the &s;olitude of her pri&s;on, gave way to the de&s;pair which her condition in&s;pired. She tried to arrange her thoughts, and to argue her&s;elf into &s;ome degree of re&s;ignation; but reflection, by repre&s;enting the pa&s;t, and rea&s;on, by anti|cipating the future, brought before her mind the full picture of her misfortunes, and &s;he &s;unk in de&s;pondency. Of Theodore, who, by a conduct &s;o noble, had te&s;tified his at|tachment and involved him&s;elf in ruin, &s;he thought with a degree of angui&s;h infinitely &s;uperior to any &s;he had felt upon any other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the very exertions which had de|&s;erved all her gratitude, and awakened all her tenderne&s;s, &s;hould be the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction, was a circum&s;tance &s;o much beyond the ordinary bounds of mi&s;ery, that her fortitude &s;unk at once before it. The idea of Theodore &s;uffering&mdash;Theodore dying&mdash;was for ever pre&s;ent to her imagination, and frequently excluding the &s;en&s;e of her
<PB N="103" REF="102">
own danger, made her con&s;cious only of his. Sometimes the hope he had given her of be|ing able to vindicate his conduct, or at lea&s;t to obtain a pardon, would return; but it was like the faint beam of an April morn, tran&s;ient and cheerle&s;s. She knew that the Marquis, &s;tung with jealou&s;y, and exa&s;|perated to revenge, would pur&s;ue him with unrelenting malice.</P>
<P>Again&s;t &s;uch an enemy what could Theo|dore oppo&s;e? Con&s;cious rectitude would not avail him to ward off the blow which di&s;|appointed pa&s;&s;ion and powerful pride directed. Her di&s;tre&s;s was con&s;iderably heightened by reflecting that no intelligence of him could reach her at the Abbey, and that &s;he mu&s;t remain &s;he knew not how long in the mo&s;t dreadful &s;u&s;pence concerning his fate. From the Abbey &s;he &s;aw no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping. She was a pri&s;oner in a chamber inclo&s;ed at every avenue: &s;he had no opportunity of conver&s;ing with any per&s;on who could afford her even a chance of relief; and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf condemned to await in pa&s;&s;ive &s;ilence the impending de&s;tiny, infinitely more dreadful to her immagination than death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, &s;he yielded to the pre&s;&s;ure of her misfortunes, and would &s;it for hours motionle&s;s and given up to thought. <Q REND="inline">"Theodore!"</Q> &s;he would frequently exclaim,
<PB N="104" REF="103">
<Q REND="inline">"you cannot hear my voice, you cannot fly to help me; your&s;elf a pri&s;oner and in chains."</Q> The picture was too horrid. The &s;welling angui&s;h of her heart would &s;ubdue her utterance&mdash;tears bathed her checks&mdash;and &s;he became in&s;en&s;ible to every thing but the mi&s;ery of Theodore.</P>
<P>On this evening her mind had been remarkably tranquil; and as &s;he watched from her window, with a &s;till and melan|choly plea&s;ure, the &s;etting &s;un, the fading &s;plendour of the we&s;tern horizon, and the gardual approach of twilight, her thoughts bore her back to the time when, in happier circum&s;tances, &s;he had watched the &s;ame appearances. She recollected al&s;o the evening of her temporary e&s;cape from the Abbey, when from this &s;ame window &s;he had viewed the declining &s;un&mdash;how anxiou&s;ly &s;he had awaited the fall of twilight&mdash;how much &s;he had endeavoured to anticipate the events of her future life&mdash;with what trembling fear &s;he had de&s;cended from the tower and ven|tured into the fore&s;t. The&s;e reflections pro|duced others that filled her heart with angui&s;h and her eyes with tears.</P>
<P>While &s;he was lo&s;t in her melancholy reverie &s;he &s;aw the Marquis mount his hor&s;e and depart from the gates. The &s;ight of him revived, in all its force, a &s;en&s;e of the mi|&s;ery he inflicted on her beloved Theodore,
<PB N="105" REF="104">
and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evils which more immediately threatened her&s;elf. She with|drew from the window in an agony of tears, which continuing for a con&s;iderable time, her frame was at length, quite exhau&s;ted, and &s;he retired early to re&s;t.</P>
<P>La Motte remained in his chamber till &s;upper obliged him to de&s;cend. At table his wild and haggard countenance, which, in &s;pite of all his endeavours, betrayed the di&s;order of his mind, and his long and fre|quent fits of ab&s;traction &s;urpri&s;ed as well as alarmed Madame La Motte. When Peter left the room &s;he tenderly inquired what had di&s;turbed him, and he with a di&s;torted &s;mile tried to be gay, but the effort was be|yond his art, and he quickly relap&s;ed into &s;ilence; or when Madame La Motte &s;poke, and he &s;trove to conceal the ab&s;ence of his thoughts, he an&s;wered &s;o intirely from the purpo&s;e, that his ab&s;traction became &s;till more apparent. Ob&s;erving this, Madame La Motte appeared to take no notice of his pre&s;ent temper; and they continued to &s;it in uninterrupted &s;ilence till the hour of re&s;t, when they retired to their chamber.</P>
<P>La Motte lay in a &s;tate of di&s;turbed watch|fulne&s;s for &s;ome time, and his frequent &s;tarts awoke Madame, who, however, being pacified by &s;ome trifling excu&s;e, &s;oon went to &s;leep again. This agitation continued
<PB N="106" REF="105">
till near midnight, when, recollecting that the time was now pa&s;&s;ing in idle reflection which ought to be devoted to action, he &s;tole &s;ilently from his bed, wrapped him|&s;elf in his night gown, and, taking the lamp which burned nightly in his cham|ber, pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e. As he went he frequently looked back, and often &s;tarted and li&s;tened to the hollow &s;ighings of the bla&s;t.</P>
<P>His hand &s;hook &s;o violently, when he at|tempted to unlock the door of Adeline's chamber, that he was obliged to &s;et the lamp on the ground, and apply both his hands. The noi&s;e he made with the key induced him to &s;uppo&s;e he mu&s;t have awakened her; but when he opened the door, and perceived the &s;tillne&s;s that reigned within, he was convinced &s;he was a&s;leep. When he approached the bed he heard her gently breathe, and &s;oon after &s;igh&mdash;and he &s;topped; but &s;ilence returning, he again ad|vanced, and then heard her &s;ing in her &s;leep. As he li&s;tened he di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ome notes of a melancholy little air which, in her happier days, &s;he had often &s;ung to him. The low and mournful accent in which &s;he now uttered them expre&s;&s;ed too well the tone of her mind.</P>
<P>La Motte now &s;tepped ha&s;tily towards the bed, when, breathing a deep &s;igh, &s;he was
<PB N="107" REF="106">
again &s;ilent. He undrew the curtain, and &s;aw her lying in a profound &s;leep, her cheek yet wet with tears, re&s;ting upon her arm. He &s;tood a moment looking at her; and as he viewed her innocent and lovely countenance, pale in grief, the light of the lamp, which &s;hone &s;trong upon her eyes, awoke her, and, perceiving a man, &s;he uttered a &s;cream. Her recol|lection returning, &s;he knew him to be La Motte, and it in&s;tantly recurring to her that the Marquis was at hand, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf in bed, and implored pity and pro|tection. La Motte &s;tood looking eagerly at her, but without replying.</P>
<P>The wildne&s;s of his looks and the gloomy &s;ilence he pre&s;erved increa&s;ed her alarm, and with tears of terror &s;he renewed her &s;upplication. <Q REND="inline">"You once &s;aved me from de&s;truction,"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"O &s;ave me now! Have pity upon me&mdash;I have no protector but you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is it you fear?"</Q> &s;aid La Motte in a tone &s;carcely articulate.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O &s;ave me&mdash;&s;ave me from the Marquis!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ri&s;e then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and dre&s;s your&s;elf quickly&mdash;I &s;hall be back again in a few minutes."</Q> He lighted a candle that &s;tood on the table, and left the cham|ber. Adeline immediately aro&s;e and en|deavoured to dre&s;s, but her thoughts were
<PB N="108" REF="107">
&s;o bewildered that &s;he &s;carcely knew what &s;he did, and her whole frame &s;o violently agitated that it was with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty &s;he pre&s;erved her&s;elf from faint|ing. She threw her clothes ha&s;tily on, and then &s;at down to await the return of La Motte. A con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed, yet he did not appear, and, having in vain endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, the pain of &s;u&s;pence at length became &s;o in&s;up|portable, that &s;he opened the door of her chamber, and went to the top of the &s;tair|ca&s;e to li&s;ten. She thought &s;he heard voi|ces below; but, con&s;idering that if the Marquis was there her appearance could only increa&s;e her danger, &s;he checked the &s;tep &s;he had almo&s;t involuntarily taken to de&s;cend. Still &s;he li&s;tened, and &s;till thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed voices. Soon after &s;he heard a door &s;hut, and then foot&s;teps, and &s;he ha&s;tened back to her chamber.</P>
<P>Near a quarter of an hour elap&s;ed and La Motte did not appear. When again &s;he thought &s;he heard a murmur of voices below, and al&s;o pa&s;&s;ing &s;teps, and at length her anxiety not &s;uffering her to remain in her room, &s;he mooved through the pa&s;&s;age that com|municated with the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e; but all was now &s;till. In a few moments, however, a light fla&s;hed acro&s;s the hall, and La Motte appeared at the door of the vaulted room.
<PB N="109" REF="108">
He looked up, and &s;eeing Adeline in the gallery, beckoned her to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated and looked towards her chamber; but La Motte now approached the &s;tairs, and, with faultering &s;teps, &s;he went to meet him. <Q REND="inline">"I fear the Marquis may &s;ee me,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, whi&s;pering; <Q REND="inline">"where is he?"</Q> La Motte took her hand, and led her on, a&s;&s;uring her &s;he had no|thing to fear from the Marquis. The wild|ne&s;s of his looks, however, and the tremb|ling of his hand, &s;eemed to contradict this a&s;&s;urance, and &s;he inquired whither he was leading her. <Q REND="inline">"To the fore&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"that you may e&s;cape from the Abbey&mdash;a hor&s;e waits for you without. I can &s;ave you by no other means."</Q> New terror &s;eized her. She could &s;carcely believe that La Motte, who had hitherto con|&s;pired with the Marquis, and had &s;o clo&s;ely confined her, &s;hould now him&s;elf undertake her e&s;cape, and &s;he at this moment felt a dreadful pre&s;entiment, which it was im|po&s;&s;ible to account for, that he was lead|ding her out to murder her in the fore&s;t. Again &s;hrinking back, &s;he &s;upplicated his mercy. He a&s;&s;ured her he meant only to protect her, and de&s;ired &s;he would not wa&s;te time.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in his manner that &s;poke &s;incerity, and &s;he &s;uffered him
<PB N="110" REF="109">
to conduct her to a &s;ide door that opened into the fore&s;t, where &s;he could ju&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;h through the gloom a man on hor&s;e|back. This brought to her remembrance the night in which &s;he had quutted the tomb, when tru&s;ting to the per&s;on who appeared &s;he had been carried to the Marquis's villa, La Motte called, and was an&s;wered by Peter, who&s;e voice &s;omewhat re-a&s;&s;ured Ade|line.</P>
<P>He then told her that the Marquis would return to the Abbey on the following morn|ing, and that this could be her only oppor|tunity of e&s;caping his de&s;igns; that &s;he might rely upon his (La Motte's) word, that Peter had orders to carry her wherever &s;he cho&s;e; but as he knew the Marquis would be indefa|tigable in &s;earch of her, he advi&s;ed her by all means to leave the kingdom, which &s;he might do with Peter, who was a native of Savoy, and would convey her to the hou&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter. There &s;he might remain till La Motte him&s;elf, who did not now think it would be &s;afe to continue much longer in France, &s;hould join her. He intreat|ed her whatever might happen, never to mention the events which had pa&s;&s;ed at the Abbey. <Q REND="inline">"To &s;ave you, Adeline, I have ri&s;ked my life; do not encrea&s;e my danger and your own by any un|nece&s;&s;ary di&s;coveries. We may never meet
<PB N="111" REF="110">
again, but I hope you will be happy; and remember, when you think of me, that I am not quite &s;o bad as I have been tempted to be."</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he gave her &s;ome money, which he told her would be nece&s;&s;ary to de|fray the expences of her journey. Adeline could no longer doubt his &s;incerity, and her tran&s;ports of joy and gratitude would &s;carcely permit her to thank him. She wi&s;hed to have bid Madame La Motte farewell, and indeed earne&s;tly reque&s;ted it; but he again told her &s;he had no time to lo&s;e, and, having wrapped her in a large cloak, he lifted her upon the hor&s;e. She bade him adieu with tears of gratitude, and Peter &s;et off as fa&s;t as the darkne&s;s would permit.</P>
<P>When they were got &s;ome way, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad with all my heart, Ma'am&s;elle,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ee you again. Who would have thought, after all, that my ma&s;ter him|&s;elf would have bid me take you away!&mdash;Well, to be &s;ure, &s;trange things come to pa&s;s; but I hope we &s;hall have better luck this time."</Q> Adeline, not chu&s;ing to re|proach him with the treachery of which &s;he feared he had been formerly guilty, thanked him for his good wi&s;hes, and &s;aid &s;he hoped they &s;hould be more fortunate; but Peter, in his u&s;ual &s;train of eloquence, proceeded to undeceive her in this point, and to acquaint
<PB N="112" REF="111">
her with every circum&s;tance which his me|mory, and it was naturally a &s;trong one, could furni&s;h:</P>
<P>Peter expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch an artle&s;s intere&s;t in her welfare, and &s;uch a concern for her di&s;appointment, that &s;he could no longer doubt his faithfulne&s;s; and this conviction not only &s;trengthened her confidence in the pre&s;ent undertaking, but made her li&s;ten to his conver&s;ation with kindne&s;s and plea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould never have &s;taid at the Abbey till this time,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"if I could have got away; but my ma&s;ter frighted me &s;o about the Marquis, and I had not money enough to carry me into my own country, &s;o that I was forced to &s;tay. It's well we have got &s;ome &s;olid louis-d'ors now; for I que&s;tion, Ma'am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">elle, whether the peo|ple on the road would have taken tho&s;e trinkets you formerly talked of for money."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Po&s;&s;ibly not,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"I am thankful to Mon&s;ieur La Motte that we have more certain means of procuring con|veniences. What route &s;hall you take when we leave the fore&s;t, Peter?"&mdash;</Q>Peter mentioned very correctly a great part of the road to Lyons: <Q REND="inline">"and then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"we can ea&s;ily get to Savoy, and that will be nothing. My &s;i&s;ter, God ble&s;s her! I hope is living; I have not &s;een her many year; but if &s;he is not, all the people
<PB N="113" REF="112">
will be glad to &s;ee me, and you will ea&s;ily get a lodging, Ma'am&s;elle, and every thing you want."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline re&s;olved to go with him to Savoy. La Motte, who knew the character and de|&s;igns of the Marquis, had advi&s;ed her to leave the kingdom, and had told her, what her fears would have &s;ugge&s;ted, that the Mar|quis would be indefatigable in &s;earch of her. His motive for this advice mu&s;t be a de&s;ire of &s;erving her; why el&s;e, when &s;he was already in his power, &s;hould he remove her to ano|ther place, and even furni&s;h her with money for the expences of a journey?</P>
<P>At Leloncourt, where Peter &s;aid he was well known, &s;he would be mo&s;t likely to meet with protection and comfort, even &s;hould his &s;i&s;ter be dead; and its di&s;tance and &s;olitary &s;ituation were circum&s;tances that plea&s;ed her. The&s;e reflections would have pointed out to her the prudence of pro|ceeding to Savoy, had &s;he been le&s;s de&s;titute of re&s;ources in France; in her pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion they proved it to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>She enquired farther concerning the route they were to take, and whether Peter was &s;ufficiently acquainted with the road.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"When once I get to Thiers, I know it well enough,"</Q> &s;aid Peter, <Q REND="inline">"for I have gone it many a time in my younger days, and any body will tell us the way there."</Q> They
<PB N="114" REF="113">
travelled for &s;everal hours in darkne&s;s and &s;i|lence, and it was not till they emerged from the fore&s;t that Adeline &s;aw the morning light &s;treak the ea&s;tern clouds. The &s;ight cheered and revived her; and as &s;he travell|ed &s;ilently along, her mind revolved the events of the pa&s;t night, and meditated plans for the future. The pre&s;ent kindne&s;s of La Motte appeared &s;o very different from his former conduct, that it a&s;toni&s;hed and per|plexed her, and &s;he could only account for it by attributing it to one of tho&s;e &s;udden im|pul&s;es of humanity which &s;ometimes ope|rate even upon the mo&s;t depraved hearts.</P>
<P>But when &s;he recollected his former words, <Q REND="inline">"that he was not ma&s;ter of him&s;elf,"</Q> &s;he could &s;carcely believe that mere pity could induce him to break the bonds which had hi|therto &s;o &s;trongly held him, and then, con&s;i|dering the altered conduct of the Marquis, &s;he was inclined to think that &s;he owed her liberty to &s;ome change in his &s;entiments to|wards her; yet the advice La Motte had given her o quit the kingdom, and the money with which he had &s;upplied her for that purpo&s;e, &s;eemed to contradict this opinion, and involved her again in doubt.</P>
<P>Peter now got directions to Thiers, which place they reached without any accident, and there &s;topped to refre&s;h them&s;elves. As &s;oon as Peter thought the hor&s;e &s;ufficiently
<PB N="115" REF="114">
re&s;ted, they again &s;et forward, and from the rich plains of the Lyonnois Adeline, for the fir&s;t time, caught a view of the di&s;tant alps, who&s;e maje&s;tic heads, &s;eeming to prop the vault of heaven, filled her mind with &s;ublime emotions.</P>
<P>In a few hours they reached the vale, in which &s;tands the city of Lyons, who&s;e beau|tiful environs, &s;tudded with villas, and rich with cultivation, withdrew Adeline from the melancholy contemplation of her own cir|cum&s;tances, and her more painful anxiety for Theodore.</P>
<P>When they reached that bu&s;y city, her fir&s;t care was to enquire concerning the pa&s;|&s;age of the Rhone; but &s;he forbore to make the&s;e inquiries of the people of the inn, con&s;i|dering that if the Marquis &s;hould trace her thither they might enable him to pur&s;ue her route. She, therefore, &s;ent Peter to the quays to hire a boat, while &s;he her&s;elf took a &s;light repa&s;t, it being her intention to embark immediately. Peter pre&s;ently returned, hav|ing engaged a boat and men to take them up the Rhone to the neare&s;t part of Savoy, from whence they were to proceed by land to the village of Leloncourt.</P>
<P>Having taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, &s;he or|dered him to conduct her to the ve&s;&s;el. A new and &s;triking &s;eene pre&s;ented it&s;elf to Ade|line, who looked with &s;urpri&s;e upon the river
<PB N="116" REF="115">
gay with ve&s;&s;els, and the quay crowded with bu&s;y faces, and felt the contra&s;t which the cheerful objects around bore to her&s;elf&mdash;to her an orphan, de&s;olate, helple&s;s, and flying from per&s;ecution and her country. She &s;poke with the ma&s;ter of the boat, and having &s;ent Peter back to the inn for the hor&s;e, (La Motte's gift to Peter in lieu of &s;ome arrears of wages) they embarked.</P>
<P>As they &s;lowly pa&s;&s;ed up the Rhone, who&s;e &s;teep banks, crowned with mountains, ex|hibited the mo&s;t various, wild, and roman|tic &s;cenery, Adeline &s;at in pen&s;ive reverie. The novelty of the &s;cene through which &s;he floated, now frowning with &s;avage grandeur, and now &s;miling in fertility, and gay with towns and villages, &s;oothed her mind, and her &s;orrow gradually &s;oftened into a gentle and not unplea&s;ing melancholy. She had &s;eated her&s;elf at the head of the boat, where &s;he watched its &s;ides cleave the &s;wift &s;tream, and li&s;tened to the da&s;hing of the waters.</P>
<P>The boat, &s;lowly oppo&s;ing the current, pa&s;&s;ed along for &s;ome hours, and at length the veil of evening was &s;tretched over the land&s;cape. The weather was fine, and Ade|line, regardle&s;s of the dews that now fell, remained in the open air, ob&s;erving the ob|jects darken round her, the gay tints of the horizon fade away, and the &s;tars gradually appear, trembling upon the lucid mirror
<PB N="117" REF="116">
of the waters. The &s;cene was now &s;unk in deep &s;hadow, and the &s;ilence of the hour was broken only by the mea&s;ured da&s;hing of the oars, and now and then by the voice of Peter &s;peaking to the boatmen. Adeline &s;at lo&s;t in thought: the forlornne&s;s of her cir|cum&s;tances came heightened to her imagi|nation.</P>

She pictured to her&s;elf the rage of the Marquis now that he had di&s;co|vered her flight, and though &s;he knew it very unlikely he &s;hould follow her by water, for which rea&s;on &s;he had cho&s;en that manner of travelling, &s;he trembled at the portrait her fancy drew.

<P>When Adeline left the Abbey, La Motte had remained for &s;ome time at the gate, li&s;tening to the &s;teps of the hor&s;e that carried her, till the &s;ound was lo&s;t in di&s;tance; he then turned into the hall with a lightne&s;s of heart to which he had long been a &s;tranger. The &s;atisfaction of having thus pre&s;erved her, as he hoped, from the de&s;igns of the Marquis, overcame for a while all &s;en&s;e of the danger in which this &s;tep mu&s;t involve him. But when he returned intirely to his own &s;ituati|on, the terrors of the Marquis's re&s;entment &s;truck their full force upon his mind, and he con&s;idered how he might be&s;t e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>It was now pa&s;t midnight&mdash;the Marquis
<PB N="119" REF="118">
was expected early on the following day; and in this interval it at fir&s;t appeared pro|bable to him that he might quit the fore&s;t. There was only one hor&s;e; but he con&s;ider|ed whether it would be be&s;t to &s;et off im|mediately for Auboine, where a carriage might be procured to convey his family and his moveables from the Abbey, or quietly to await the arrival of the Marquis, and endea|vour to impo&s;e upon him by a forged &s;tory of Adeline's e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The time which mu&s;t clap&s;e before a car|riage could reach the Abbey would leave him &s;carcely &s;ufficient to e&s;cape from the fore&s;t; what money he had remaining from the Marquis's bounty would not carry him far; and when it was expended he mu&s;t pro|bably be at a lo&s;s for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould he not before then be detected. By remaining at the Abbey it would appear that he was un|con&s;cious of de&s;erving the Marquis's re&s;ent|ment, and though he could not expect to impre&s;s a belief upon him that his orders had been executed, he might make it appear that Peter only had been acce&s;&s;ary to the e&s;cape of Adeline; an account which would &s;eem the more probable from Peter's having been formerly detected in a &s;imilar &s;cheme. He believed al&s;o that if the Marquis &s;hould threat|en to deliver him into the hands of ju&s;tice, he might &s;ave him&s;elf by a menace of di&s;|clo&s;ing
<PB N="120" REF="119">
the crime he had commi&s;&s;ioned him to perpetrate.</P>
<P>Thus arguing La Motte re&s;olved to remain at the Abbey and await the event of the Mar|quis's di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>When the Marquis did arrive, and was informed of Adeline's flight, the &s;trong workings of his &s;oul, which appeared in his countenance, for a while alarmed and terrified La Motte. He cur&s;ed him&s;elf and her in terms of &s;uch coar&s;ene&s;s and vehe|mence as La Motte was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear from a man who&s;e <HI>manners</HI> were generally amiable, whatever might be the violence and criminality of his pa&s;&s;ions. To invent and expre&s;s the&s;e terms &s;eemed to give him not only relief, but delight; yet he appeared more &s;hocked at the circum&s;tance of her e&s;|cape than exa&s;perated at the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of La Motte and recollecting at length that he wa&s;ted time, he left the Abbey, and di&s;|patched &s;everal of his &s;ervants in pur&s;uit of her.</P>
<P>When he was gnoe, La Motte, believing his &s;tory had &s;ucceeded, returned to the plea&s;ure of con&s;idering that he had done his duty, and to the hope that Adeline was now beyond the reach of pur&s;uit. This calm was of &s;hort continuance. In a few hours the Marquis returned, accompanied by the officers of ju&s;tice. The affrighted La Motte,
<PB N="121" REF="120">
perceiving him approach, endeavoured to conceal him&s;elf but was &s;eized and carried to the Marquis, who drew him a&s;ide.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not to be impo&s;ed upon,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"by &s;uch a &s;uperficial &s;tory as you have invented; you know your life is in my hands; tell me in&s;tantly where you have &s;ecreted Adeline, or I will charge you with the crime you have committed again&s;t me; but, upon your di&s;clo&s;ing the place of her conceal|ment, I will di&s;mi&s;s the officers, and, if you wi&s;h it, a&s;&s;i&s;t you to leave the kingdom. You have no time to he&s;itate, and may know that I will not be trifled with."</Q> La Motte attempted to appea&s;e the Marquis, and affirmed that Adeline was really fled he knew not whither. <Q REND="inline">"You will remember, my Lord, that your charac|ter is al&s;o in my power; and that, if you proceed to extremities, you will compel me to reveal in the face of day that you would have made me a mur|derer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And who will believe you?"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"The crimes that bani&s;hed you from &s;ociety will be no te&s;timony of your veracity, and that with which I now charge you will bring with it a &s;ufficient pre&s;umption that your accu&s;ation is malicious. Officers, do your duty."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121">
They entered the room and &s;eized La Motte, whom terror now deprived of all power of re&s;i&s;tance, could re&s;i&s;tance have availed him, and in the perturbation of his mind he informed the Marquis that Adeline had taken the road to Lyons. This di&s;covery, however, was made too late to &s;erve him&s;elf; the Marquis &s;eized the advantage it offered, but the charge had been given, and, with the angui&s;h of knowing that he had expo&s;ed Adeline to danger without benefiting him&s;elf, La Motte &s;ubmitted in &s;ilence to his fate. Scarcely allowing him time to collect what little effects might ea&s;ily be carried with him, the officers conveyed him from the Abbey; but the Marquis, in con&s;ideration of the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of Madame La Motte, directed one of his &s;ervants to procure a carriage from Auboine that &s;he might follow her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The Marquis, in the mean time, now acquainted with the route Adeline had ta|ken, &s;ent forward his faithful valet to trace her to her place of concealment, and re|turn immediately with intelligence to the villa.</P>
<P>Abandoned to de&s;pair, La Motte and his wife quitted the fore&s;t of Fontangville, which had for &s;o many months afforded them an a&s;ylum, and embarked once more upon
<PB N="123" REF="122">
the tumultuous world, where ju&s;tice would meet La Motte in the form of de&s;truction. They had entered the fore&s;t as a refuge, ren|dered nece&s;&s;ary by the former crimes of La Motte, and for &s;ome time found in it the &s;e|curity they &s;ought; but other offences, for even in that &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot there hap|pened to be temptation, &s;oon &s;ucceeded, and his life, already &s;ufficiently marked by the puni&s;hment of vice, now afforded him another in&s;tance of this great truth, <Q REND="inline">"That where guilt is, there peace cannot enter."</Q></P>

<P>ADELINE, mean while, and Peter proceeded on their voyage, without any accident, and landed in Savoy, where Peter placed her upon the hor&s;e, and him&s;elf walk|ed be&s;ide her. When he came within &s;ight of his native mountains, his extravagant joy bur&s;t forth into frequent exclamations, and he would often a&s;k Adeline if &s;he had ever &s;een &s;uch <HI>hills</HI> in France. <Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"the hills there are very well for French hills, but they are not to be named on the &s;ame day with ours."</Q> Adeline, lo&s;t
<PB N="124" REF="123">
in admiration of the a&s;toni&s;hing and tremen|dous &s;cenery around her, a&s;&s;ented very warmly to the truth of Peter's a&s;&s;ertion, which encouraged him to expatiate more largely upon the advantages of his country; its di&s;advantages he totally forgot; and though he gave away his la&s;t &s;ous to the children of the pea&s;antry that run barefooted by the &s;ide of the hor&s;e, he &s;poke of nothing but the happine&s;s and content of the inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>His native village, indeed, was an excep|tion to the general character of the coun|try, and to the u&s;ual effects of an arbitrary government; it was flouri&s;hing, healthy, and happy; and the&s;e advantages it chiefly owed to the activity and attention of the benevolent clergyman who&s;e cure it was:</P>
<P>Adeline, who now began to feel the effects of long anxiety and fatigue, much wi&s;h|ed to arrive at the end of her journey, and inquired impatiently of Peter concerning it. Her &s;pirits, thus weakened, the gloomy grandeur of the &s;cenes which had &s;o lately awakened emotions of delightful &s;ublimity, now awed her into terror; &s;he trembled at the &s;ound of the torrents rolling among the clifts and thundering in the vale below, and &s;hrunk from the view of the precipices, which &s;ometimes overhung the road, and at others appeared beneath it. Fatigued as
<PB N="125" REF="124">
&s;he was, &s;he frequently di&s;mounted to climb on foot the &s;teep flinty road, which &s;he feared to travel on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The day was clo&s;ing when they drew near a &s;mall village at the foot of the Savoy Alps, and the &s;un, in all his evening &s;plendour, now &s;inking behind their &s;ummits, threw a farewell gleam athwart the land&s;cape, &s;o &s;oft and glowing as drew from Adeline, languid as &s;he was, an exclamation of rap|ture.</P>
<P>The romantic &s;ituation of the village next attracted her notice. It &s;tood at the foot of &s;everal &s;tupendous mountains, which formed a chain round a lake at &s;ome little di&s;tance, and the woods that &s;wept from their &s;ummits almo&s;t embo&s;omed the village. The lake, unruffled by the lighte&s;t air, re|flected the vermeil tints of the horizon with the &s;ublime &s;cenery on its borders, darken|ing every in&s;tant with the falling twilight.</P>
<P>When Peter perceived the village, he bur&s;t into a &s;hout of joy. <Q REND="inline">"Thank God,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"we are near home; there is my dear native place. It looks ju&s;t as it did twenty years ago; and there are the &s;ame old trees growing round our cottage yonder, and the huge rock that ri&s;es above it. My poor father died there, Ma'am&s;elle. Pray heaven my &s;i&s;ter be alive; it is a long while &s;ince I &s;aw her."</Q>
<PB N="126" REF="125">
Adeline li&s;tened with a melancholy plea|&s;ure to the&s;e artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of Peter, who, in retracing the &s;cenes of his former days, &s;eemed to live them over again. As they approached the village, he continued to point out various objects of his remembrance. <Q REND="inline">"And there too is the good pa&s;tor's chateau; look, Ma'am&s;elle, that white hou&s;e, with the &s;moke curling, that &s;tands on the edge of the lake yonder. I wonder whe|ther he is alive yet. He was not old when I left the place, and as much be|loved as ever man was; but death &s;pares nobody!"</Q></P>
<P>They had by this time reached the vil|lage which was extremely neat, though it did not promi&s;e much accommodation. Peter had hardly advanced ten &s;teps be|fore he was acco&s;ted by &s;ome of his old acquaintance, who &s;hook hands, and &s;eemed not to know how to part with him. He in|quired for his &s;i&s;ter, and was told &s;he was alive and well. As they pa&s;&s;ed on, &s;o many of his old friends flocked round him, that Adeline became quite weary of the delay. Many whom he had left in the vigour of life were now tottering under the infirmities of age, whiletheir &s;ons and daughters, whom he had known only in the playfulne&s;s of in|fancy, were grown from his remembrance, and in the pride of youth. At length they
<PB N="127" REF="126">
approached the cottage, and were met by his &s;i&s;ter, who, having heard of his ar|rival, came and welcomed him with unfeign|ed joy.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing Adeline, &s;he &s;eemed &s;urprized, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to alight, and conducting her into a &s;mall but neat cottage, received her with a warmth of ready kindne&s;s which would have graced a better &s;ituation. Ade|line de&s;ired to &s;peak with her alone, for the room was now crowded with Peter's friends, and then acquainting her with &s;uch particulars of her circum&s;tances as it was nece&s;&s;ary to communicate, de&s;ired to know if &s;he could be accommodated with lodging in the cottage. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'am&s;elle,"</Q> &s;aid the good woman, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uch as it is, you are hear|tily welcome. I am only &s;orry it is not better. But you &s;eem ill, Ma'am&s;elle; what &s;hall I get you?"</Q></P>
<P>Adeline, who had been long &s;truggling with fatigue and indi&s;po&s;ition, now yielded to their pre&s;&s;ure. She &s;aid &s;he was, indeed, ill; but hoped that re&s;t would re&s;tore her, and de&s;ired a bed might be immediately pre|pared. The good woman went out to obey her, and &s;oon returning, &s;hewed her to a little cabin, where &s;he retired to a bed, who&s;e cleanline&s;s was its only recommen|dation.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="127">
But, notwith&s;tanding her fatigue, &s;he could not &s;leep, and her mind, in &s;pite of all her efforts, returned to the &s;cenes that were pa&s;&s;ed, or pre&s;ented gloomy and imper|fect vi&s;ions of the future.</P>
<P>The difference between her own con|dition and that of other per&s;ons, educa|ted as &s;he had been, &s;truck her forcibly, and &s;he wept. <Q REND="inline">"They,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"have friends and relations, all &s;triving to &s;ave them not only from what may hurt, but what may di&s;plea&s;e them; watching not only for their pre&s;ent &s;afety, but for their future advantage, and preventing them even from injuring them&s;elves. But dur|ing my whole life I have never known a friend; have been in general &s;urrounded by enemies, and very &s;eldom exempt from &s;ome circum&s;tance either of danger or calamity. Yet &s;urely I am not born to be for ever wretched; the time will come when"&mdash;</Q>She began to think &s;he might one time be happy; but recollecting the de&s;|perate &s;ituation of Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I can never hope even for peace!"</Q></P>
<P>Early the following morning the good woman of the hou&s;e came to inquire how &s;he had re&s;ted, and found &s;he had &s;lept little, and was much wor&s;e than on the preceding night. The unea&s;ine&s;s of her mind contributed to heighten the feveri&s;h &s;ypmtoms that attended
<PB N="129" REF="128">
her, and in the cour&s;e of the day her di&s;|order began to a&s;&s;ume a &s;erious a&s;pect. She ob&s;erved its progre&s;s with compo&s;ure, re|&s;igning her&s;elf to the will of God, and feel|ing little to regret in life. Her kind ho&s;te&s;s did every thing in her power to relieve her, and there was neither phy&s;ician nor apo|thecary in the village, &s;o that nature was deprived of none of her advantages. Not|with&s;tanding this, the di&s;order rapidly in|crea&s;ed, and on the third day from its fir&s;t attack &s;he became delirious; after which &s;he &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P>How long &s;he remained in this deplorable condition &s;he knew not; but, on recovering her &s;en&s;es, &s;he found her&s;elf in an apart|ment very different from any &s;he remember|ed. It was &s;pacious and almo&s;t beautiful, the bed and every thing around being in one &s;tile of elegant &s;implicity. For &s;ome mi|nutes &s;he lay in a trance of &s;urpri&s;e, endea|vouring to recollect her &s;cattered ideas of the pa&s;t, and almo&s;t fearing to move, le&s;t the plea&s;ing vi&s;ion &s;hould vani&s;h from her eyes.</P>
<P>At length &s;he ventured to rai&s;e her&s;elf, when &s;he pre&s;ently heard a &s;oft voice &s;peak|ing near her, and the bed curtain on one &s;ide was gently undrawn by a beautiful girl. As &s;he leaned forward over the bed, and with a &s;mile of mingled tenderne&s;s and joy inquired of her patient how &s;he did, Ade|line
<PB N="130" REF="129">
gazed in &s;ilent admiration upon the mo&s;t intere&s;ting female countenance &s;he had ever &s;een, in which the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weet|ne&s;s, united with lively &s;en&s;e and refine|ment, was cha&s;tened by &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Adeline at length recollected her&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently to thank her kind inquirer, and begged to know to whom &s;he was obliged, and where &s;he was? The lovely girl pre&s;&s;|ed her hand, <Q REND="inline">"'Tis we who are obliged,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he. <Q REND="inline">"Oh! how I rejoice to find that you have recovered your recollection."</Q> She &s;aid no more, but flew to the door of the apartment, and di&s;appeared. In a few minutes &s;he returned with an elderly lady, who, approaching the bed with an air of tender intere&s;t, a&s;ked concerning the &s;tate of Adeline; to which the latter replied, as well as the agitation of her &s;pirits would per|mit, and repeated her de&s;ire of knowing to whom &s;he was &s;o greatly obliged. <Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall know that hereafter,"</Q> &s;aid the lady; <Q REND="inline">"at pre&s;ent be a&s;&s;ured that you are with tho&s;e who will think their care much over|paid by your recovery; &s;ubmit, there|fore, to every thing that may conduce to it, and con&s;ent to be kept as quiet as po&s;|&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline gratefully &s;miled, and bowed her head in &s;ilent a&s;&s;ent. The lady now quitted the room for a medicine; having given
<PB N="131" REF="130">
which to Adeline, the curtain was clo&s;ed, and &s;he was left to repo&s;e. But her thoughts were too bu&s;y to &s;uffer her to profit by the opportunity. She contemplated the pa&s;t, and viewed the pre&s;ent, and, when &s;he compared them, the contra&s;t &s;truck her with a&s;toni&s;hment. The whole appeared like one of tho&s;e &s;udden tran&s;itions &s;o frequent in dreams, in which we pa&s;s from grief and de&s;pair, we know not how, to comfort and delight.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he looked forward to the future with a trembling anxiety, that threatened to re|tard her recovery, and which, when &s;he remembered the words of her generous be|nefactre&s;s, &s;he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s. Had &s;he better known the di&s;po&s;ition of the per|&s;ons in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he now was, her anxi|ety, as far as it regarded her&s;elf, mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure have been done away; for La Luc, its owner, was one of tho&s;e rare characters to whom misfortune &s;eldom looks in vain, and who&s;e native goodne&s;s, con|firmed by principle, is uniform and una&s;|&s;uming in its acts. The following little pic|ture of his dome&s;tic life, his family and his manners, will more fully illu&s;trate his cha|racter. It was drawn from the life, and its exactne&s;s will, it is hoped, compen&s;ate for its length.

<P>In the village of Leloncourt, celebrated for its picture&s;que &s;ituation at the foot of the Savoy Alps, lived Arnaud La Luc, a clergyman, de&s;cended from an ancient fa|mily of France, who&s;e decayed fortunes occa&s;ioned them to &s;eek a retreat in Swit|zerland, in an age when the violence of civil commotion &s;eldom &s;pared the conquer|ed. He was mini&s;ter of the village, and equally loved for the piety and benevolence of the Chri&s;tian as re&s;pected for the dignity and elevation of the philo&s;opher. His was the philo&s;ophy of nature, directed by com|mon &s;en&s;e. He de&s;pi&s;ed the jargon o the modern &s;chools and the brilliant ab&s;urdities of &s;y&s;tems, which have dazzled without en|lightening,
<PB N="133" REF="132">
and guided without convincing their di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>His mind was penetrating; his views ex|ten&s;ive; and his &s;y&s;tems, like his religion, were &s;imple, rational, and &s;ublime. The people of his pari&s;h looked up to him as to a father; for while his precepts directed their minds, his example touched their hearts.</P>
<P>In early youth La Luc lo&s;t a wife, whom he tenderly loved. This event threw a tincture of &s;oft and intere&s;ting melancholy over his character, which remained when time had mellowed the remembrance that occa&s;ioned it. Philo&s;ophy had &s;trengthened, not hardened, his heart; it enabled him to re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of affliction, rather than to overcome it.</P>
<P>Calamity taught him to feel with peculiar &s;ympathy the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others. His income from the pari&s;h was &s;mall, and what remain|ed from the divided and reduced e&s;tates of his ance&s;tors did not much increa&s;e it; but though he could not always relieve the nece&s;&s;ities of the indigent, his tender pity and holy conver&s;ation &s;eldom failed in admini&s;tering con&s;olation to the mental &s;ufferer. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the &s;weet and exqui&s;ite emotions of his heart have often induced him to &s;ay, that could the voluptuary be once &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e feelings, he would never after forego
<PB N="134" REF="133">
<Q REND="inline">"the luxury of doing good."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Igno|rance of true plea&s;ure,"</Q> he would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"more frequently than temptation to that which is fal&s;e, leads to vice."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc had one &s;on and a daughter, who were too young, when their mother died, to lament their lo&s;s. He loved them with peculiar tenderne&s;s, as the children of her whom he never cea&s;ed to deplore; and it was for &s;ome time his &s;ole amu&s;ement to ob&s;erve the gradual unfolding of their infant minds, and to bend them to virtue. His was the deep and &s;ilent &s;orrow of the heart; his complaints he never obtruded upon others, and very &s;eldom did he even men|tion his wife. His grief was too &s;acred for the eye of the vulgar. Often he retired to the deep &s;olitude of the mountains, and amid their &s;olemn and tremendous &s;cenery would brood over the remembrance of times pa&s;t, and re&s;ign him&s;elf to the luxury of grief. On his return from the&s;e little ex|cur&s;ions he was always more placid and con|tented. A &s;weet tranquillity, which aro&s;e almo&s;t to happine&s;s, was diffu&s;ed over his mind, and his manners were more than u&s;ually benevolent. As he gazed on his children, and fondly ki&s;&s;ed them, a tear would &s;ometimes &s;teal into his eye, but it was a tear of tender regret, unmingled with
<PB N="135" REF="134">
the darker qualities of &s;orrow, and was mo&s;t precious to his heart.</P>
<P>On the death of his wife he received into his hou&s;e a maiden &s;i&s;ter, a &s;en&s;ible worthy woman, who was deeply intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s of her brother. Her affec|tionate attention and judicious conduct an|ticipated the effect of time in &s;oftening the poignancy of his di&s;tre&s;s, and her unremit|ted care of his children, while it proved the goodne&s;s of her own heart, attracted her more clo&s;ely to his.</P>
<P>It was with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure that he traced in the infant features of Clara the re|&s;emblance of her mother. The &s;ame gen|tlene&s;s of manner and the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon di&s;played them&s;elves, and as &s;he grew up, her actions frequently re|minded him &s;o &s;trongly of his lo&s;t wife as to fix him in reveries, which ab&s;orbed all his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Engaged in the duties of his pari&s;h, the education of his children, and in philo&s;ophic re&s;earch, his years pa&s;&s;ed in tranquillity. The tender melancholy with which afflic|tion had tinctured his mind was, by long indulgence, become dear to him, and he would not have relinqui&s;hed it for the bright|e&s;t dream of airy happine&s;s. When any pa&s;&s;ing incident di&s;turbed him, he retired for con&s;olation to the idea of her he &s;o faith|fully
<PB N="136" REF="135">
loved, and yielding to a gentle, and what the world would call a romantic, &s;ad|ne&s;s, gradually rea&s;&s;umed his compo&s;ure. This was the &s;ecret luxury to which he withdrew from temporary di&s;appointment&mdash;the &s;olitary enjoyment which di&s;&s;ipated the cloud of care, and blunted the &s;ting of vex|ation&mdash;which elevated his mind above this world, and opened to his view the &s;ublimi|ty of another.</P>
<P>The &s;pot he now inhabited, the &s;urround|ing &s;cenery, the romantic beauties of the neighbouring walks, were dear to La Luc, for they had once been loved by Clara; they had been the &s;cenes of her tenderne&s;s, and of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>His chateau &s;tood on the borders of a &s;mall lake that was almo&s;t environed by mountains of &s;tupendous height, which, &s;hooting into a variety of grote&s;que forms, compo&s;ed a &s;cenery &s;ingularly &s;olemn and &s;ublime. Dark woods intermingled with bold projections of rock, &s;ometimes barren, and &s;ometimes covered with the purple bloom of wild flowers, impended over the lake, and were &s;een in the clear mirror of its waters. The wild and alpine heights which ro&s;e above were either crowned with perpetual &s;nows, or exhibited tremendous crags and ma&s;&s;es of &s;olid rock, who&s;e ap|pearance was continually changing as the
<PB N="137" REF="136">
rays of light were variou&s;ly reflected on their &s;urface, and who&s;e &s;ummits were often wrapt in impenetrable mi&s;ts. Some cottages and hamlets, &s;cattered on the margin of the lake, or &s;eated in picture&s;que points of view on the rocks above, were the only objects that reminded the beholder of humanity.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the lake, nearly oppo&s;ite to the chateau, the mountains receded, and a long chain of alps was &s;een &s;tretching in per&s;pective. Their innumerable tints and &s;hades, &s;ome veiled in blue mi&s;ts, &s;ome tinged with rich purple, and others glit|tering in partial light, gave luxurious and magical colouring to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The chateau was not large, but it was convenient, and was characteri&s;ed by an air of elegant &s;implicity and good order. The entrance was a &s;mall hall, which opening by a gla&s;s door into the garden, afforded a view of the lake, with the magnificent &s;cenery exhibited on its bor|ders. On the left of the hall was La Luc's &s;tudy, where he u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed his mornings; and adjoining was a &s;mall room fitted up with chymical apparatus, a&s;tronomical in&s;truments, and other im|plements of &s;cience. On the right was the family parlour, and behind it a room which belonged exclu&s;ively to Madame
<PB N="138" REF="137">
La Luc. Here were depo&s;ited various me|dicines and botanical di&s;tillations, together with the apparatus for preparing them. From this room the whole village was liberally &s;upplied with phy&s;ical comfort; for it was the pride of Madame to believe her&s;elf &s;kilful in relieving the di&s;orders of her neighbours.</P>
<P>Behind the chateau ro&s;e a tuft of pines, and in front a gentle declivity, covered with verdure and flowers, extended to the lake, who&s;e waters flowed even with the gra&s;s, and gave fre&s;hne&s;s to the acacias that waved over its &s;urface. Flowering &s;hrubs, intermingled with mountain a&s;h, cypre&s;s, and ever-green oak, marked the boundary of the garden.</P>
<P>At the return of &s;pring it was Clara's care to direct the young &s;hoots of the plants, to nur&s;e the budding flowers, and to &s;helter them with the luxuriant branches of the &s;hrubs from the cold bla&s;ts that de&s;cended from the mountains. In &s;ummer &s;he u&s;ually ro&s;e with the &s;un, and vi&s;ited her favourite flowers while the dew yet hung glittering on their leaves. The fre&s;hne&s;s of early day, with the glowing colouring which then touched the &s;cenery, gave a pure and exqui&s;ite delight to her innocent heart. Born amid &s;cenes of grandeur and &s;ublimity, &s;he had quickly imbibed a ta&s;te for their charms, which ta&s;te was heightened by the influence
<PB N="139" REF="138">
of a warm imagination. To view the &s;un ri&s;ing above the alps, tinging their &s;nowy heads with light, and &s;uddenly darting his rays over the whole face of nature&mdash;to fee the fiery &s;plendour of the clouds reflected in the laek below, and the ro&s;eate tints fir&s;t &s;teal upon the rocks above&mdash;were among the earlie&s;t plea&s;ures of which Clara was &s;u&s;ceptible. From being delighted with the ob&s;ervance of nature, &s;he grew plea&s;ed with &s;eeing her finely imitated, and &s;oon di&s;played a ta&s;te for poetry and painting. When &s;he was about &s;ixteen &s;he often &s;elected from her father's library tho&s;e of the Italian poets mo&s;t celebrated for picture&s;que beauty, and would &s;pend the fir&s;t hours of morning in reading them under the &s;hade of the acacias that bordered the lake. Here too &s;he would often attempt rude &s;ketches of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery, and at length by repeated efforts, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome in&s;truction from her brother, &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o well as to produce twelve drawings in crayon, which were judged worthy of decorating the parlour of the chateau.</P>
<P>Young La Luc played the flute, and &s;he li&s;tened to him with exqui&s;ite delight, particularly when he &s;tood on the margin of the lake, under her beloved acacias. Her voice was &s;weet and flexible, thought not &s;trong, and &s;he &s;oon learned to modulate
<PB N="140" REF="139">
it to the in&s;trument. She knew nothing of the intricacies of execution; her airs were &s;imple, and her &s;tyle equally &s;o, but &s;he &s;oon gave them a touching expre&s;&s;ion, in&s;pired by the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, which &s;eldom left tho&s;e of her hearers unaffected.</P>
<P>It was the happine&s;s of La Luc to &s;ee his children happy, and in one of his excur&s;ions to Geneva, whither he went to vi&s;it &s;ome relations of his late wife, he bought Clara a lute. She received it with more gratitude than &s;he could expre&s;s; and having learned one air, &s;he ha&s;tened to her favourite acacias, and played it again and again till &s;he forgot every thing be&s;ides. Her little dome&s;tic duties, her books, her drawing, even the hour which her father dedicated to her improvement, when &s;he met her brother in the library, and with him partook of knowledge, even this hour pa&s;&s;ed unheeded by. La Luc &s;uffered it to pa&s;s. Madame was di&s;plea&s;ed that her niece neglected her dome&s;tic duties, and wi&s;hed to reprove her, but La Luc begged &s;he would be &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"Let expe|rience teach her her error,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"precept &s;eldom brings conviction to young minds."</Q></P>
<P>Madame objected that experience was a &s;low teacher. <Q REND="inline">"It is a &s;ure one,"</Q> replied La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"and is not unfrequently the quicke&s;t of all teachers: when it can|not
<PB N="141" REF="140">
lead us into &s;erious evil, it is well to tru&s;t to it."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;econd day pa&s;&s;ed with Clara as the fir&s;t, and the third as the &s;econd. She could now play &s;everal tunes; &s;he came to her father and repeated what &s;he had learnt.</P>
<P>At &s;upper the cream was not dre&s;&s;ed, and there was no fruit on the table. La Luc inquired the rea&s;on; Clara recollected it, and blu&s;hed. She ob&s;erved that her brother was ab&s;ent, but nothing was &s;aid. Toward the conclu&s;ion of the repa&s;t he appeared; his countenance expre&s;&s;ed unu&s;ual &s;atisfaction, but he &s;eated him&s;elf in &s;ilence. Clara inqui|red what had detained him from &s;upper, and learnt that he had been to a &s;ick family in the neighbourhood with the weekly allow|ance which her father gave them. La Luc had entru&s;ted the care of this family to his daughter, and it was her duty to have carried them their little allowance on the preceding day, but &s;he had forgot every thing but mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How did you find the woman?"</Q> &s;aid La Luc to his &s;on. <Q REND="inline">"Wor&s;e, Sir,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"for her medicines had not been regularly given, and the children had had little or no food to-day."</Q></P>
<P>Clara was &s;hocked. <Q REND="inline">"No food to-day!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"and I have been playing all day on my lute, under the aca|cias by the lake!"</Q> Her father did not
<PB N="142" REF="141">
&s;eem to ob&s;erve her emotion, but turned to his &s;on. <Q REND="inline">"I left her better,"</Q> &s;aid the latter; <Q REND="inline">"the medicines I carried ea&s;ed her pain, and I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee her children make a joyful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">pper."</Q></P>
<P>Clara, perhaps for the fir&s;t time in her life, envied him his plea&s;ure; her heart was full, and &s;he &s;at &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"No food to day!"</Q> thought &s;he.</P>
<P>She retired pen&s;ively to her chamber. The &s;weet &s;erenity with which &s;he u&s;ually went to re&s;t was vani&s;hed, for &s;he could no longer reflect on the pa&s;t day with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What a pity,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that what is &s;o plea&s;ing &s;hould be the cau&s;e of &s;o much pain! This lute is my delight, and my torment!"</Q> This reflection occa&s;ioned her much internal debate; but before &s;he could come to any re&s;olution upon the point in que&s;tion, &s;he fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>She awoke very early the next morning, and impatiently watched the progre&s;s of the dawn. The &s;un at lenth appearing, &s;he aro&s;e, and, determined to make all the a|tonement in her power for her former neg|lect, ha&s;tened to the cottage.</P>
<P>Here &s;he remained a con&s;iderable time, and when &s;he returned to the chateau her countenance had recovered all its u&s;ual &s;ere|nity. She re&s;olved, however, not to touch her lute that day.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="142">
Till the hour of breakfa&s;t &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf in binding up the flowers, and pruning the &s;hoots that were too luxuriant, and &s;he at length found her&s;elf, &s;he &s;carcely knew how, beneath her beloved acacias by the &s;ide of the lake. <Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;weetly would the &s;ong I learned ye&s;terday, &s;ound now over the waters!"</Q> But &s;he remembered her determination, and checked the &s;tep &s;he was involuntarily tak|ing towards the chateau.</P>
<P>She attended her father in the library at the u&s;ual hour, and learned, from his di&s;cour&s;e with her brother on what had been read the two preceding days, that &s;he had lo&s;t much entertaining knowledge. She reque&s;t|ed her father would inform her to what this conver&s;ation alluded; but he calmly re|plied, that &s;he had preferred another amu&s;e|ment at the time when the &s;ubject was di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, and mu&s;t therefore content her&s;elf with ignorance. <Q REND="inline">"You would reap the rewards of &s;tudy from the amu&s;ements of idle|ne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"learn to be rea&s;onable&mdash;d not expect to unite incon&s;i&s;tencies."</Q></P>
<P>Clara felt the ju&s;tne&s;s of this rebuke, and remembered her lute. <Q REND="inline">"What mi&s;chief has it occa&s;ioned!"</Q> &s;ighed &s;he. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, I am determined not to touch it at all this day. I will prove that I am able to controul my inclinations when I &s;ee it
<PB N="144" REF="143">
is nece&s;&s;ary &s;o to do."</Q> Thus re&s;olving, &s;he applied her&s;elf to &s;tudy with more than u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>She adhered to her re&s;olution, and to|wards the clo&s;e of day went into the garden to amu&s;e her&s;elf. The evening was &s;till and uncommonly beautiful. Nothing was heard but the faint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing of the leaves, which returned but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ervals, making &s;ilence more &s;olenm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> di&s;tant murmurs of the torrents that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed among the cliffs. As &s;he &s;tood by the lake, and watched the &s;un &s;lowly &s;inking below the alps, who&s;e &s;ummits were tinged with gold and purple; as &s;he &s;aw the la&s;t rays of light gleam upon the waters who&s;e &s;urface was not curled by the lighte&s;t air, &s;he &s;ighed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! how enchanting would be the &s;ound of my lute at this moment, on this &s;pot, and when every thing is &s;o &s;till around me!"</Q></P>
<P>The temptation was too powerful for the re&s;olution of Clara: &s;he ran to the chateau, returned with the in&s;trument to her dear acacias, and beneath their &s;hade continued to play till the &s;urrounding objects faded in in darkne&s;s from her &s;ight. But the moon aro&s;e, and, &s;hedding a trembling lu&s;tre on the lake, made the &s;cene more captivating than ever.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to quit &s;o delightful a &s;pot; Clara repeated her favourite airs again
<PB N="145" REF="144">
and again. The beauty of the hour awaken|ed all her genius; &s;he never played with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion before, and &s;he li&s;tened with in|crea&s;ing rapture to the tones as they langui&s;h|ed over the waters and died away on the di&s;|tant air. She was perfectly enchanted <Q REND="inline">"No! nothing was ever &s;o delightful as to play on the lute beneath her acacias, on the margin of the lake, by moon|light!"</Q></P>
<P>When &s;he returned to the chateau, &s;upper was over. La Luc had ob&s;erved Clara, and would not &s;uffer her to be interrupt|ed.</P>
<P>When the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the hour was pa&s;&s;ed &s;he recollected that &s;he had broken her re&s;olution, and the reflection gave her pain. <Q REND="inline">"I prided my&s;elf on controling my incli|nations,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and I have weakly yielded to their direction. But what evil have I incurred by indulging them this evening? I have neglected no duty, for I had none to perform. Of what then have I to accu&s;e my&s;elf? It would have been ab&s;urd to have kept my re&s;olution, and denied my&s;elf a plea&s;ure when there ap|peared no rea&s;on for this &s;elf-denial."</Q></P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, not quite &s;atisfied with this rea&s;oning. Suddenly re&s;uming her enquiry, <Q REND="inline">"But how,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"am I certain that I &s;hould have re&s;i&s;ted my inclinations if
<PB N="146" REF="145">
there <HI>had</HI> been a rea&s;on for oppo&s;ing them? If the poor family whom I neglected ye&s;|terday had been un&s;upplied to day, I fear I &s;hould again have forgotten them while I played on my lute on the banks of the lake."</Q></P>
<P>She then recollected all that her father had at different times &s;aid on the &s;ub|ject of &s;elf-command, and &s;he felt &s;ome pain.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if I do not con&s;ider that to pre&s;erve a re&s;olution, which I have once &s;olemnly formed, is a &s;ufficient rea|&s;on to control my inclinations, I fear no other motive would long re&s;train me. I &s;eriou&s;ly determined not to touch my lute this whole day, and I have broken my re&s;olution. To-morrow perhaps I may be tempted to neglect &s;ome duty, for I have di&s;covered that I cannot rely on my own prudence. Since I cannot conquer temp|tation, I will fly from it."</Q></P>
<P>On the following morning &s;he brought her lute to La Luc, and begged he would re|ceive it again, and at lea&s;t keep it till &s;he had taught her inclinations to &s;ubmit to con|trol.</P>
<P>The heart of La Luc &s;welled as &s;he &s;poke. <Q REND="inline">"No, Clara,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"it is unnece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould receive your lute; the &s;a|crifice you would make proves you wor|thy
<PB N="147" REF="146">
of my confidence. Take back the in&s;trument; &s;ince you have &s;ufficient re&s;o|lution to re&s;ign it when it leads you from duty, I doubt not that you will be able to control its influence now that it is re&s;tored to you."</Q></P>
<P>Clara felt a degree of plea&s;ure and pride at the&s;e words, &s;uch as &s;he had never before experienced; but &s;he thought, that to de|&s;erve the commendation they be&s;towed, it was nece&s;&s;ary to complete the &s;acrifice &s;he had begun. In the virtuous enthu&s;ia&s;m of the moment the delights of mu&s;ic were forgotten in tho&s;e of a&s;piring to well-earned prai&s;e, and when &s;he refu&s;ed the lute thus offered, &s;he was con&s;cious only of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations. <Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, tears of plea&s;ure &s;welling in her eyes, <Q REND="inline">"allow me to de&s;erve the prai&s;es you be&s;tow, and then I &s;hall indeed be happy."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc thought &s;he had never re&s;embled her mother &s;o much as at this in&s;tant, and, tenderly ki&s;&s;ing her, he for &s;ome moments wept in &s;ilence. When he was able to &s;peak, <Q REND="inline">"You do already de&s;erve my prai&s;es,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and I re&s;tore your lute as a reward for the conduct which excites them."</Q> This &s;cene called back recollections too tender for the heart of La Luc, and giving Clara the in&s;t ument, he abruptly quitted the room.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="147">
La Luc's &s;on, a youth of much promi&s;e, was de&s;igned by his father for the church, and had received from him an excellent edu|cation, which, however, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould fini&s;h at an univer&s;ity. That of Geneva was fixed upon by La Luc. His &s;cheme had been to make his &s;on not a &s;cholar only; he was ambitious that he &s;hould al&s;o be enviable as a man. From early infancy he had accu&s;tomed him to hardihood and endurance, and, as he ad|vanced in youth, he encouraged him in manly exerci&s;es, and acquainted him with the u&s;eful arts as well as with ab&s;tract &s;ci|ence.</P>
<P>He was high &s;pirited and ardent in his temper, but his heart was generous and af|fectionate. He looked forward to Geneva, and to the new world it would di&s;clo&s;e, with the &s;anguine expectations of youth; and in the delight of the&s;e expectations was ab&s;orbed the regret he would otherwi&s;e have felt at a &s;eparation from his family.</P>
<P>A brother of the late Madame La Luc, who was by birth an Engli&s;h woman, re|&s;ided at Geneva with his family. To have been related to his wife was a &s;ufficient claim upon the heart of La Luc, and he had, therefore, always kept up an intercour&s;e with Mr. Audley, though the difference in their characters and manner of thinking would
<PB N="149" REF="148">
never permit this a&s;&s;ociation to advance into friend&s;hip. La Luc now wrote to him, &s;ig|nifying an intention of &s;ending his &s;on to Geneva, and recommending him to his care; to this letter Mr. Audley returned a friendly an&s;wer, and a &s;hort time after an acquain|tance of La Luc's being called to Geneva, he determined that his &s;on &s;hould accompany him. The &s;eparation was painful to La Luc, and almo&s;t in&s;upportable to Clara. Madame was grieved, and took care that he &s;hould have a &s;ufficient quantity of medicines put up in his travelling trunk; &s;he was al&s;o at &s;ome pains to point out their virtues, and the different complaints for which they were requi&s;ite; but &s;he was careful to deli|ver her lecture during the ab&s;ence of her brother.</P>
<P>La Luc, with his daughter, accompanied his &s;on on hor&s;eback to the next town, which was about eight miles from Leloncourt, and there again enforcing all the advice he had formerly given him re&s;pecting his conduct and pur&s;uits, and again yielding to the ten|der weakne&s;s of the father, he bade him farewell. Clara wept, and felt more &s;orrow at this parting than the occa&s;ion could ju&s;ti|fy; but this was almo&s;t the fir&s;t time &s;he had known grief, and &s;he artle&s;sly yielded to its influence.</P>
<P>La Luc and Clara travelled pen&s;ively
<PB N="150" REF="149">
back, and the day was clo&s;ing when they came within view of the lake, and &s;oon after of the chateau. Never had it appeared gloomy till now; but now Clara wandered forlornly through every de&s;erted apartment where &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee her brother, and recollected a thou&s;and little circum&s;tances, which, had he been pre&s;ent, &s;he would have thought immaterial, but on which imagination now &s;tamped a value. the garden, the &s;cenes around, all wore a melancholy a&s;pect, and it was long ere they re&s;umed their natural character and Clara re|covered her vivacity.</P>
<P>Near four years had elap&s;ed &s;ince this &s;eparation when one evening, as Madame La Luc and her niece were &s;itting at work together, in the parlour, a good woman in the neighbourhood de&s;ired to be admitted. She came to a&s;k for &s;ome medicines, and the advice of Madame La Luc. <Q REND="inline">"Here is a &s;ad accident happened at our hou&s;e, Madame,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure my heart aches for the poor young creature."&mdash;</Q>Madame La Luc de&s;ired &s;he would explain her&s;elf, and the woman proceeded to &s;ay, that her brother Peter, whom &s;he had not &s;een for &s;o many years, was arrived, and had brought a young lady to her cottage, who &s;he verily believed was dying. She de&s;cribed her di&s;|order, and acquainted Madame with what

particulars of her mournful &s;tory Peter had related, failing not to exaggerate &s;uch as her compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy &s;tranger and her love of the marvellous prompted.</P>
<P>The account appeared a very extraor|dinary one to Madame; but pity for the forlorn condition of the young &s;ufferer induced her to inquire farther into the af|fair. <Q REND="inline">"Do let me go to her, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid Clara, who had been li&s;tening with ready compa&s;&s;ion to the poor woman's narrative: <Q REND="inline">"do &s;uffer me to go&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t want comforts, and I wi&s;h much to &s;ee how &s;he is."</Q> Madame a&s;ked &s;ome farther que&s;tions concerning her di&s;order, and then, taking off her &s;pectacles, &s;he ro&s;e from her chair and &s;aid &s;he would go her&s;elf. Clara de&s;ired to accompany her. They put on their hats and followed the good woman to the cottage, where, in a very &s;mall, clo&s;e room, on a mi&s;erable bed, lay Adeline, pale, emaciated, and uncon|&s;cious of all around her. Madame turned to the woman, and a&s;ked how long &s;he had been in this way, while Clara went up to the bed, and taking the almo&s;t lifele&s;s hand that lay on the quilt, looked anxiou&s;ly in her face. <Q REND="inline">"She ob&s;erves nothing,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"poor creature! I wi&s;h &s;he was at the chateau, &s;he would be better accom|modated, and I could nur&s;e her there,"</Q>
<PB N="152" REF="151">
The woman told Madame La Luc, that the young lady had lain in that &s;tate for &s;everal hours. Madame examined her pul&s;e, and &s;hook her head. <Q REND="inline">"This room is very clo&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Very clo&s;e indeed,"</Q> cried Clara, eagerly; <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely &s;he would be better at the chateau, if &s;he could be moved."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We will &s;ee you about that,"</Q> &s;aid her aunt. <Q REND="inline">"In the mean time let me &s;peak to Peter; it is &s;ome years &s;ince I &s;aw him."</Q> She went to the outer room, and the woman ran out of the cottage to look for him. When &s;he was gone, <Q REND="inline">"This is a mi&s;erable habitation for the poor &s;tranger,"</Q> &s;aid Clara; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he will never be well here: do, Madam, let her be carried to our hou&s;e; I am &s;ure my father would wi&s;h it. Be&s;ides, there is &s;omething in her features, even inanimate as they now are, that prejudices me in her favour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall I never per&s;uade you to give up that romantic notion of judging people by their faces,"</Q> &s;aid her aunt. <Q REND="inline">"What &s;ort of a face &s;he has, is of very little con&s;equence&mdash;her condition is lamentable, and I am de&s;irous of al|tering it; but I wi&s;h fir&s;t to a&s;k Peter a few que&s;tions concerning her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thank you, my dear aunt,"</Q> &s;aid Clara; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he will be removed then."</Q> Ma|dame
<PB N="153" REF="152">
La Luc was going to reply; but Peter now entered, and, expre&s;&s;ing great joy at &s;eeing her again, inquired how Mon&s;ieur La Luc and Clara did. Clara immediately wel|comed hone&s;t Peter to his native place, and he returned her &s;alutation with many expre&s;|&s;ions of &s;urpri&s;e at finding her <HI>&s;o much grown.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Though I have &s;o often dandled you in my arms, Ma'am&s;elle, I &s;hould never have known you again. Young twigs &s;hoot fa&s;t, as they &s;ay."</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Luc now inquired into the particulars of Adeline's &s;tory, and heard as much as Peter knew of it, being only that his late ma&s;ter found her in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, and that he had him&s;elf brought her from the Abbey to &s;ave her from a French Marquis. The &s;implicity of Peter's manner would not &s;uffer her to que&s;tion his veracity, though &s;ome of the circum&s;tances he re|lated excited all her &s;urpri&s;e, and awaken|ed all her pity. Tears frequently &s;tood in Clara's eyes during the cour&s;e of his narra|tive, and when he concluded, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Dear Madam, I am &s;ure when my father learns the hi&s;tory of this unhappy young woman, he will not refu&s;e to be a parent to her, and I will be her &s;i&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She de&s;erves it all,"</Q> &s;aid Peter, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;he is very good indeed."</Q> He then proceeded in a &s;train of prai&s;e, which was very unu&s;ual
<PB N="154" REF="153">
with him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will go home and con&s;ult with my brother about her,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Luc, ri&s;ing: <Q REND="inline">"&s;he certainly ought to be removed to a more airy room. The chateau is &s;o near, that I think &s;he may be carried thither without much ri&s;k."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven ble&s;s you! Madam,"</Q> cried Pe|ter, rubbing his hands, <Q REND="inline">"for your goodne&s;s to my poor young lady."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc had ju&s;t returned from his evening walk when they reached the chateau. Ma|dame told him where &s;he had been, and re|lated the hi&s;tory of Adeline and her pre&s;ent condition. <Q REND="inline">"By all means have her re|moved hither,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, who&s;e eyes bore te&s;timony to the tenderne&s;s of his heart. <Q REND="inline">"She can be better attended to here than in Su&s;an's cottage."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew you would &s;ay &s;o, my dear father,"</Q> &s;aid Clara: <Q REND="inline">"I will go and order the green bed to be prepared for her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be patient, niece,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Luc: <Q REND="inline">"there is no occa&s;ion for &s;uch ha&s;te: &s;ome things are to be con&s;idered fir&s;t; but you are young and romantic."&mdash;</Q>La Luc &s;miled.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The evening is now clo&s;ed,"</Q> re&s;umed Madame; <Q REND="inline">"it will, therefore, be dangerous to remove her before morning.

which I hope may be of &s;ervice to her."&mdash;</Q>Clara reluctantly a&s;&s;ented to this delay, and Madame La Luc retired to her clo&s;et.</P>
<P>On the following morning Adeline, wrapped in blankets, and &s;heltered as much as po&s;&s;ible from the air, was brought to the chateau, where the good La Luc de&s;ired &s;he might have every attention paid her, and where Clara watched over her with uncea&s;ing anxiety and tenderne&s;s. She remained in a &s;tate of torpor during the greater part of the day, but towards evening &s;he breathed more freely; and Clara, who &s;till watched by her bed, had at length the plea&s;ure of perceiving that her &s;en&s;es were re&s;tored. It was at this moment that &s;he found her&s;elf in the &s;ituation from which we have digre&s;&s;ed to give this ac|count of the venerable La Luc and his family.

<P>ADELINE, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a fine con&s;ti|tution, and the kind at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">entions of her new friends, was in a little more than a week &s;o much recovered as to leave her chamber. She was introduced to La Luc, whom &s;he met with tears of gratitude, and thanked for his goodne&s;s in a manner &s;o warm, yet &s;o artle&s;s, as intere&s;ted him &s;till more in her favour. During the progre&s;s of her recovery, the &s;weetne&s;s of her behaviour had entirely won the heart of Clara, and greatly intere&s;ted that of her aunt, who&s;e re|ports of Adeline, together with the prai&s;es be&s;towed by Clara, had excited both e&s;teem and curio&s;ity in the brea&s;t of La Luc; and he now met her with an expre&s;&s;ion of benig|nity which &s;poke peace and comfort to her heart. She had acquainted Madame La Luc with &s;uch particulars of her &s;tory as Peter, either through ignorance or inattention, had not communicated, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing only, through a fal&s;e delicacy, perhaps, an ac|knowledgement of her attachment to Theo|dore.
<PB N="157" REF="156">
The&s;e circum&s;tances were repeated to La Luc, who, ever &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ufferings of others, was particularly intere&s;ted by the &s;ingular misfortunes of Adeline.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight had elap&s;ed &s;ince her removal to the chateau, when one morning La Luc de&s;ired to &s;peak with her alone. She followed him into his &s;tudy, and then in a manner the mo&s;t delicate he told her, that, as he found &s;he was &s;o unfortunate in her father, he de&s;ired &s;he would henceforth con|&s;ider him as her parent, and his hou&s;e as her home. <Q REND="inline">"You and Clara &s;hall be equally my daughters,"</Q> continued he; <Q REND="inline">"I am rich in having &s;uch children."</Q> The &s;trong emotions of &s;urpri&s;e and gratitude for &s;ome time kept Adeline &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"Do not thank me,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc; <Q REND="inline">"I know all you would &s;ay, and I know al&s;o that I am but doing my duty. I thank God that my duty and my plea&s;ures are generally in uni&s;on."</Q> Adeline wiped away the tears which his goodne&s;s had excited, and was going to &s;peak; but La Luc pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, turning away to conceal his emotion, walked out of the room.</P>
<P>Adeline was now con&s;idered as a part of the family, and in the parental kindne&s;s of La Luc, the &s;i&s;terly affection of Clara, and the &s;teady and uniform regard of Ma|dame, &s;he would have been happy as &s;he was
<PB N="158" REF="157">
thankful, had not uncea&s;ing anxiety for the fate of Theodore, of whom in this &s;olitude &s;he was le&s;s likely than ever to hear, corroded her heart, and embittered every moment of reflection. Even when &s;leep obliterated for a while the memory of the pa&s;t, his image frequently aro&s;e to her fancy, accompanied by all the exaggerations of terror. She &s;aw him in chains, and &s;truggling in the gra&s;p of ruffians, or &s;aw him led, amid&s;t the dread|ful preparations for execution, into the field: &s;he &s;aw the agony of his look, and heard him repeat her name in frantic accents till the horrors of the &s;cene overcame her, and &s;he awoke.</P>
<P>A &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and character at|tached her to Clara, yet the mi&s;ery that preyed upon her heart was of a nature too delicate to be &s;poken of, and &s;he never mentioned Theodore even to her friend. Her illne&s;s had yet left her weak and languid, and the perpetual anxiety of her mind contributed to prolong this &s;tate. She endeavoured, by &s;trong and almo&s;t continual efforts, to ab&s;tract her thoughts from their mournful &s;ubject, and was often &s;ucce&s;sful. La Luc had an excellant library, and the in&s;truction it offered at once gratified her love of knowledge, and withdrew her mind from painful recollections. His con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="159" REF="158">
too afforded her another refuge from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But her chief amu&s;ement was to wander among the &s;ublime &s;cenery of the adjacent country, &s;ometimes with Clara, though often with no other companion than a book. There were indeed times when the conver|&s;ation of her friend impo&s;ed a painful re|&s;traint, and, when given up to reflection &s;he would ramble alone through &s;cenes, who&s;e &s;olitary grandeur a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;oothed the melancholy of her heart. Here &s;he would retrace all the conduct of her beloved Theo|dore, and endeavour to recollect his exact countenance, his air, and manner. Now &s;he would weep at the remembrance and then, &s;uddenly con&s;idering that he had per|haps already &s;uffered an ignominious death for her &s;ake, even in con&s;equence of the very action which had proved his love, a dreadful de&s;pair would &s;eize her, and, arre&s;ting her tears, would threaten to bear down every barrier that fortitude and rea&s;on could oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Fearing longer to tru&s;t her own thoughts, &s;he would hurry home, and by a de&s;perate effort would try to lo&s;e, in the conver&s;a|tion of La Luc, the remembrance of the pa&s;t. Her melancholy, when he ob&s;erved it, La Luc attributed to a &s;en&s;e of the cruel treatment &s;he had received from her
<PB N="160" REF="159">
father; a circum&s;tance which, by exciting his compa&s;&s;ion, endeared her more &s;trongly to his heart; while that love of rational conver&s;ation, which in her calmer hours &s;o frequently appeared, opened to him a new &s;ource of amu&s;ement in the cultivation of a mind eager for knowledge, and, &s;u&s;ceptible of all the energies of genius. She found a melancholy plea&s;ure in li&s;tening to the &s;oft tones of Clara's lute, and would often &s;oothe her mind by attempting to repeat the airs &s;he heard.</P>
<P>The gentlene&s;s of her manners, partaking &s;o much of that pen&s;ive character which marked La Luc's, was &s;oothing to his heart, and tinctured his behaviour with a degree of tenderne&s;s that imparted comfort to her, and gradually won her entire confidence and affection. She &s;aw with extreme concern the declining &s;tate of his health, and united her efforts with tho&s;e of the family to amu&s;e and revive him.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing &s;ociety of which &s;he partook, and the quietne&s;s of the country, at length re&s;tored her mind to a &s;tate of to|lerable compo&s;ure. She was now acquainted with all the wild walks of the neighbouring mountains, and, never tired of viewing their a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenery, &s;he often indulged her&s;elf in traver&s;ing alone their unfrequented paths, where now and then a pea&s;ant from a neigh|bouring
<PB N="161" REF="160">
village was all that interrupted the profound &s;olitude. She generally took with her a book, that if &s;he perceived her thoughts inclined to fix on the one object of her grief, &s;he might force them to a &s;ubject le&s;s danger|ous to her peace. She had become a tolerable proficient in Engli&s;h while at the convent where &s;he received her education, and the in&s;truction of La Luc, who was well ac|quainted with the language, now &s;erved to her. He was partial to the Engli&s;h; he admired their character, and the con&s;ti|tution of their laws, and his library contained a collection of their be&s;t authors, particularly of their philo&s;ophers and poets. Adeline found that no &s;pecies of writing had power &s;o effectually to withdraw her mind from the contemplation of its own mi&s;ery, as the higher kinds of poetry, and in the&s;e her ta&s;te &s;oon taught her to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;upe|riority of the Engli&s;h from that of the French. The genius of the language, more perhaps than the genius of the people, if indeed the di&s;tinction may be allowed, occa&s;ioned this.</P>
<P>She frequently took a volume of Shake|&s;pear or Milton, and, having gained &s;ome wild eminence, would &s;eat her&s;elf benea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h the pines, who&s;e low murmurs &s;oothed her heart, and con&s;pired with the vi&s;ions of the poet to lull her to forgetfulne&s;s of grief.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="161">
One evening, when Clara was en|gaged at home, Adeline wandered alone to a favourite &s;pot among the rocks that bordered the lake. It was an eminence which commanded an entire view of the lake, and of the &s;tupendous mountains that environed it. A few ragged thorns grew from the precipice beneath, which de&s;cended perpendicularly to the water's edge; and above ro&s;e a thick wood of larch, pine, and fir, intermingled with &s;ome che&s;nut and mountain a&s;h. The evening was fine, and the air &s;o &s;till, that it &s;carcely waved the light leaves of the trees around, or rimpled the broad expan&s;e of the waters below. Adeline gazed on the &s;cene with a kind of &s;till rapture, and watched the &s;un &s;inking amid a crim&s;on glow, which tinted the bo&s;om of the lake and the &s;nowy heads of the di&s;tant alps. The delight which the &s;cenery in&s;pired,
<Q><L>"Soothing each gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion into peace,</L>
<L>"All but the &s;wellings of the &s;often'd heart,</L>
<L>"That waken, not di&s;turb, the tranquil mind!"</L></Q>
was now heightened by the tones of a French horn, and, looking on the lake, &s;he perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance a plea&s;ure boat. As it was a &s;pectacle rather un|common in this &s;olitude, &s;he concluded
<PB N="163" REF="162">
the boat contained a party of foreigners come to view the wonderful &s;cenery of the country, or perhaps of Genevois who cho&s;e to amu&s;e them&s;elves on a lake as grand, though much le&s;s exten&s;ive than their own; and the latter conjecture was probably ju&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;he li&s;tened to the mellow and en|chanting tones of the horn, which gra|dually &s;unk away in di&s;tance, the &s;cene appeared more lovely than before, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to forbear attempt|ing to paint in language what was &s;o beautiful in reality, &s;he compo&s;ed the following
<Q><LG TYPE="poem">

<P>La Luc ob&s;erving how much Adeline was charmed with the features of the country, and de&s;irous of amu&s;ing her melancholy, which, notwith&s;tanding her efforts, was often too apparent, wi&s;hed to &s;hew her other &s;cenes than tho&s;e to which her walks was circum&s;cribed. He propo&s;ed a party on hor&s;eback to take a nearer view of the Glaciers; to attempt their a&s;cent was a difficulty and fatigue to which neither La Luc, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of health, nor Adeline, were equal. She had not been accu&s;tomed to ride
<PB N="165" REF="164">
&s;ingle, and the mountainous road they were to pa&s;s made the experiment rather dangerous; but &s;he concealed her fears, and they were not &s;ufficient to make her wi&s;h to forego an enjoyment &s;uch as was now offered her.</P>
<P>The following day was fixed for this excur&s;ion. La Luc and his party aro&s;e at an early hour, and having taken a &s;light breakfa&s;t, they &s;et out towards the Glacier of Montanvert, which lay at a few leagues di&s;tance. Peter carried a &s;mall ba&s;ket of provi&s;ions; and it was their plan to dine on &s;ome plea&s;ant &s;pot in the open air.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the high enthu&s;ia&s;m of Adeline, the more com|placent plea&s;ure of La Luc, and the tran&s;|ports of Clara, as the &s;cenes of this romantic country &s;hifted to their eyes. Now frowning in dark and gloomy grandeur, it exhibited only tremendous rocks, and cataracts rolling from the heights into &s;ome deep and narrow valley, along which their united waters roared and foamed, and bur&s;t away to regions inacce&s;&s;ible to mortal foot: and now the &s;cene aro&s;e le&s;s fiercely wild;
<Q><L>"The pomp of groves and garniture of field's</L></Q>
were intermingled with the ruder features of nature, and while the &s;now froze on the
<PB N="166" REF="165">
&s;ummit of the mountain, the vine blu&s;hed at its foot.</P>
<P>Engaged in intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, and by the admiration which the country excited, they travelled on till noon, when they looked round for a plea&s;ant &s;pot where they might re&s;t and take refre&s;hment. At &s;ome little di&s;tance they perceived the ruins of a fabric which had once been a ca&s;tle; it &s;tood almo&s;t on a point of rock that overhung a deep valley; and its broken turrets ri&s;ing from among the woods that embo&s;omed it, heightened the picture&s;que beauty of the object.</P>
<P>The edifice invited curio&s;ity, and the &s;hades repo&s;e&mdash;La Luc and his party advanced.
<Q><L>"Deep &s;truck with awe, they mark'd the dome o'erthrown,</L>
<L>"Where once the beauty bloom'd, the warrior &s;hone:</L>
<L>"They &s;aw the <HI>ca&s;tle</HI>'s mould'ring towers decay'd,</L>
<L>"The loo&s;e &s;tone tott'ring o'er the trembling &s;hade."</L></Q></P>
<P>They &s;eated them&s;elves on the gra&s;s under the &s;hade of &s;ome high trees near the ruins. An opening in the woods afforded a view of the di&s;tant alps&mdash;the deep &s;ilence of &s;olitude reigned. For &s;ome time they were lo&s;t in meditation. Adeline felt a &s;weet complacency, &s;uch as &s;he had long been a &s;tranger to. Looking at La Luc, &s;he perceived a tear
<PB N="167" REF="166">
&s;tealing down his cheek, while the eleva|tion of his mind was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed on his countenance. He turned on Clara his eyes, which were now filled with tenderne&s;s, and made an effort to recover him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;tillne&s;s and total &s;eclu&s;ion of this &s;cene,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"tho&s;e &s;tu|pendous mountains, the gloomy gran|deur of the&s;e woods, together with that monument of faded glory on which the hand of time is &s;o emphatically impre&s;&s;ed, diffu&s;e a &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m over the mind, and awaken &s;en&s;ations truly &s;ublime."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc was going to &s;peak; but Peter coming forward, de&s;ired to know whe|ther he had not better open the wallet, as he fancied his honour and the young ladies mu&s;t be main hungry, jogging on &s;o far up hill and down before dinner. They acknowledged the truth of hone&s;t Peter's &s;u&s;picion, and accepted his hint.</P>
<P>Refre&s;hments were &s;pread on the gra&s;s, and having &s;eated them&s;elves under the canopy of waving woods, &s;urrounded by the &s;weets of wild flowers, they inhaled the pure breeze of the alps, which might be called &s;pirit of air, and partook of a repa&s;t which the&s;e circum&s;tances rendered delicious.</P>

How delightful would it be to pa&s;s one's life beneath the&s;e &s;hades with the friends who are dear to one!"&mdash;</Q>La Luc &s;miled at the romantic &s;implicity of the idea; but Adeline &s;ighed deeply to the image of felicity, and of Theodore, which it recalled, and turned away to conceal her tears.</P>
<P>They now mounted their hor&s;es, and &s;oon after arrived at the foot of Montanvert. The emotions of Adeline, as &s;he contemplated in various points of view the a&s;toni&s;hing objects around her, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all expre&s;&s;ion; and the feelings of the whole party were too &s;trong to admit of conver&s;ation. The profound &s;tillne&s;s which reigned in the&s;e regions of &s;olitude in&s;pired awe, and heigh|tened the &s;ublimity of the &s;cenery to an ex|qui&s;ite degree</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"as if we were walking over the ruins of the world, and were the only per&s;ons who had &s;urvived the wreck. I can &s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf that we are not left alone on the globe."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The view of the&s;e objects,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"lift the &s;oul to their Great Author, and we contemplate with a feeling almo&s;t too va&s;t for humanity&mdash;the &s;ublimity of his nature in the grandeur of his works."&mdash;</Q>La Luc rai&s;|ed his eyes, filled with tears, to heaven,
<PB N="169" REF="168">
and was for &s;ome moments lo&s;t in &s;ilent adoration.</P>
<P>They quitted the&s;e &s;cenes with extreme reluctance; but the hour of the day, and the appearance of the clouds, which &s;eemed gathering for a &s;torm, made them ha&s;ten their departure. Could &s;he have been &s;heltered from its fury, Adeline almo&s;t wi&s;hed to have witne&s;&s;ed the tremendous effect of a thunder &s;torm in the&s;e regions.</P>
<P>They returned to Leloncourt by a different route, and the &s;hade of the overhanging precipices was deepened by the gloom of the atmo&s;phere. It was evening when they came within view of the lake, which the travellers rejoiced to &s;ee, for the &s;torm &s;o long threatened was now fa&s;t approaching; the thunder murmured among the alps; and the dark vapours that rolled heavily along their &s;ides heightened their dreadful &s;ublimity. La Luc would have quick|ened his pace, but the road winding down the &s;teep &s;ide of a mountain made caution nece&s;&s;ary. The darkening air and the lightnings that now fla&s;hed along the horizon terrified Clara, but &s;he withheld the expre&s;&s;ion of her fear in con&s;ideration of her father. A peal of thunder, which &s;eemed to &s;hake the earth to its founda|tions, and was reverberated in tremendous echoes from the cliffs, bur&s;t over their heads.
<PB N="170" REF="169">
Clara's hor&s;e took fright at the &s;ound, and, &s;etting off, hurried her with amazing velocity down the mountain towards the lake, which wa&s;hed its foot. The agony of La Luc, who viewed her progre&s;s in the horrible expectation of &s;eeing her da&s;hed down the precipice that bordered the road, is not to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Clara kept her &s;eat, but terror had al|mo&s;t deprived her of &s;en&s;e. He efforts to pre&s;erve her&s;elf were mechanical, for &s;he &s;carce|ly knew what &s;he did. The hor&s;e, however, carried her &s;afely almo&s;t to the foot of the mountain, but was making towards the lake, when a gentleman who travelled along the road caught the bridle as the animal endea|voured to pa&s;s. The &s;udden &s;topping of the hor&s;e threw Clara to the ground, and, impatient of re&s;traint, the animal bur&s;t from the hand of the &s;tranger, and plunged into the lake. The violence of the fall deprived her of recollection; but while the &s;tranger endeavoured to &s;upport her, his &s;ervant ran to fetch water.</P>
<P>She &s;oon recovered, and unclo&s;ing her eyes, found her&s;elf in the arms of a che|valier, who appeared to &s;upport her with difficulty. The compa&s;&s;ion expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance, while he inquired how &s;he did, revived her &s;pirits, and &s;he was en|deavouring to thank him for his kindne&s;s
<PB N="171" REF="170">
when La Luc and Adeline came up. The terror impre&s;&s;ed on her father's features was perceived by Clara; languid as &s;he was, &s;he tried to rai&s;e her&s;elf, and &s;aid, with a faint &s;mile, which betrayed, in&s;tead of di&s;gu&s;ing her &s;ufferings, <Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir, I am not hurt."</Q> Her pale countenance and the blood that trickled down her cheek contradicted her words. But La Luc, to whom terror had &s;ugge&s;ted the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible evil, now re|joiced to hear her &s;peak; he recalled &s;ome pre&s;ence of mind, and while Adeline applied her &s;alts, he cha&s;ed her temples.</P>
<P>When &s;he revived &s;he told him how much &s;he was obliged to the &s;tranger. La Luc endeavoured to expre&s;s his gratitude; but the former interrupting him, begged he might be &s;pared the pain of receiving thanks for having followed only an impul&s;e of com|mon humanity.</P>
<P>They were now not far from Leloncourt; but the evening was almo&s;t &s;hut in, and the thunder murmured deeply among the hills. La Luc was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how to convey Clara home.</P>
<P>In endeavouring to rai&s;e her from the ground, the &s;tranger betrayed &s;uch evident &s;ymptoms of pain, that La Luc inquired concerning it. The &s;udden jerk which the hor&s;e had given the arm of the chevalier, in e&s;caping from his hold, had violently
<PB N="172" REF="171">
&s;prained his &s;houlder, and rendered his arm almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s. The pain was exqui&s;ite, and La Luc, who&s;e fears for his daughter were now &s;ub&s;iding, was &s;hocked at the circum|&s;tance, and pre&s;&s;ed the &s;tranger to accom|pany him to the village, where relief might be obtained. He accepted the invitation, and Clara, being at length placed on a hor&s;e led by her father, was conducted to the cha|teau.</P>
<P>When Madame, who had been looking out for La Luc &s;ome time, perceived the cavalcade approaching, &s;he was alarmed, and her apprehen&s;ions were confirmed when &s;he &s;aw the &s;ituation of her niece. Clara was carried into the hou&s;e, and La Luc would have &s;ent for a &s;urgeon, but there was none within &s;everal leagues of the village, neither were there any of the phy&s;ical pro|fe&s;&s;ion within the &s;ame di&s;tance. Clara was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to her chamber by Adeline, and Ma|dame La Luc undertook to examine the wounds. The re&s;ult re&s;tored peace to the family; for though &s;he was much brui&s;ed, &s;he had e&s;caped material injury; a &s;light contu&s;ion on the forehead had occa&s;ioned the blood&s;hed which at fir&s;t alarmed La Luc. Madame undertook to re&s;tore her niece in a few days with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a bal&s;am com|po&s;ed by her&s;elf, on the virtues of which &s;he de&s;canted with great eloquence, till La Luc
<PB N="173" REF="172">
interrupted her by reminding her of the condition of her patient.</P>
<P>Madame having bathed Clara's brui&s;es, and given her a cordial of incomparable efficacy, left her, and Adeline watched in the chamber of her friend till &s;he retired to her own for the night.</P>
<P>La Luc, who&s;e &s;pirits had &s;uffered much perturbation, was now tranquillized by the report his &s;i&s;ter made of Clara. He intro|duced the &s;tranger, and having mentioned the accident he had met with, de&s;ired that he might have immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Ma|dame ha&s;tened to her clo&s;et, and it is per|haps difficulty to determine whether &s;he felt mo&s;t concern for the &s;ufferings of her gue&s;t, or plea&s;ure at the opportunity thus of|fered of di&s;playing her phy&s;ical &s;kill. How|ever this might be, &s;he quitted the room with great alacrity, and very quickly re|turned with a phial containing her ine&s;tima|ble bal&s;am, and having given the nece&s;&s;ary directions for the application of it, &s;he left the &s;tranger to the care of his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>La Luc in&s;i&s;ted that the chevalier, M. Verneuil, &s;hould not leave the chateau that night, and he very readily &s;ubmitted to be detained. His manners during the evening were as frank and engaging as the ho&s;pita|lity and gratitude of La Luc were &s;incere, and they &s;oon entered into intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation.
<PB N="174" REF="173">
M. Verneuil conver&s;ed like a man who had &s;een much, and thought more, and if he di&s;covered any prejudice in his opinions, it was evidently the prejudice of a mind which, &s;eeing objects through the medium of its own goodne&s;s, tinges them with the hue of its predominant quality. La Luc was much plea&s;ed, for in his retired &s;ituation he had not often an opportunity of receiving the plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from a communion of intelligent minds. He found that M. Verneuil had travelled. La Luc having a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions relative to Eng|land, they fell into di&s;cour&s;e concerning the national characters of the French and Eng|li&s;h.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If it is the privilege of wi&s;dom,"</Q> &s;aid M. Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"to look beyond happine&s;s, I own I had rather be without it. When we ob&s;erve the Engli&s;h, their laws, writ|ings, and conver&s;ation, and at the &s;ame time mark their countenances, manners, and the frequency of &s;uicide among them, we are apt to believe that wi&s;dom and happine&s;s are incompatible. If, on the other hand, we turn to their neighbours, the French, and &s;ee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be remembered that this was &s;aid in the &s;e|venteenth century.</NOTE> their wretched po|licy, their &s;parkling, but &s;ophi&s;tical di&s;|cour&s;e,
<PB N="175" REF="174">
frivolous occupations, and, with|al, their gay animated air, we &s;hall be compelled to acknowledge that happine&s;s and folly too often dwell together."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is the end of wi&s;dom,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"to attain happine&s;s, and I can hardly dig|nify that conduct or cour&s;e of thinking which tends to mi&s;ery with the name of wi&s;dom. By this rule, perhaps, the fol|ly, as we term it, of the French de&s;erves, &s;ince its effect is happine&s;s, to be called wi&s;dom. That airy thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which &s;eems alike to contemn reflection and anticipation, produces all the effect of it without reducing its &s;ubjects to the mortification of philo&s;ophy. But in truth wi&s;dom is an exertion of mind to &s;ubdue folly; and as the happine&s;s of the French is le&s;s the con&s;equence of mind than of con&s;titution, it de&s;erves not the honours of wi&s;dom."</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;ing on the variety of opinions that are daily formed on the &s;ame conduct, La Luc ob&s;erved how much that which is commonly called opinion is the re&s;ult of pa&s;&s;ion and temper.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> &s;aid M. Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"there is a tone of thought, as there is a key note in mu&s;ic, that leads all its weaker affections. Thus where the powers of judging may be equal, the di&s;po&s;ition to
<PB N="176" REF="175">
judge is different, and the actions of men are at lea&s;t but too often arraigned by whim and caprice, by partial vanity and the humour of the moment."</Q></P>
<P>Here La Luc took occa&s;ion to reprobate the conduct of tho&s;e writers, who, by &s;hew|ing the dark &s;ide only of human nature, and by dwelling on the evils only which are incident to humanity, have &s;ought to de|grade man in his own eyes, and to make him di&s;contented with life. <Q REND="inline">"What &s;hould we &s;ay of a painter,"</Q> continued La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"who collected in his piece objects of a black hue only, who pre&s;ented you with a black man, a black hor&s;e, a black dog, &amp;c. &amp;c., and tells you that his is a pic|ture of nature, and that nature is black?"&mdash;"'Tis true, you would reply, "the ob|jects you exhibit do exi&s;t in nature, but they form a very &s;mall part of her works. You &s;ay that nature is black, and, to prove it, you have collected on your canva&s;s all the animals of this hue that exi&s;t. But you have forgot to paint the green earth, the blue &s;ky, the white man, and objects of all tho&s;e various hues with which creation abounds, and of which black is a very incon&s;iderable part."</Q></P>
<P>The countenance of M. Verneuil ligh|tened with peculiar animation during the
<PB N="177" REF="176">
di&s;cour&s;e of La Luc.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To think well of his nature,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"is nece&s;&s;ary to the dignity and the happine&s;s of man. There is a decent pride which becomes every mind, and is congenial to virtue. That con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innate dignity, which &s;hews him the glory of his nature, will be his be&s;t protection from the meanne&s;s of vice. Where this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is wanting,"</Q> continued M. Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"there can be no &s;en&s;e of moral honour, and con&s;equently none of the higher prin|ples of action. What can be expected of him who &s;ays it is his nature to be mean and &s;elfi&s;h? Or who can doubt that he who thinks thus, thinks from the ex|perience of his own heart, from the ten|dency of his own inclinations? Let it always be remembered, that he who would per&s;uade men to be good, ought to &s;hew them that they are great."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"with the hone&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m of a virtuous mind; and in obeying the impul&s;e of your heart, you utter the truths of philo&s;ophy: and, tru&s;t me, a bad heart and a <HI>truly</HI> phi|lo&s;ophic head has never yet been united in the &s;ame individual. Vicious inclinati|ons not only corrupt the heart, but the under&s;tanding, and thus lead to fal&s;e rea|&s;oning.
<PB N="178" REF="177">
Virtue only is on the &s;ide of truth."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc and his gue&s;t, mutually plea&s;ed with each other, entered upon the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of &s;ubjects &s;o intere&s;ting to them both, that it was late before they parted for the night.</P>

<P>REPOSE had &s;o much re&s;tored Clara, that when Adeline, anxious to know how &s;he did, went early in the morning to her chamber, &s;he found her already ri&s;en, and ready to attend the family at breakfa&s;t|Mon&s;ieur Verneuil appeared al&s;o, but his looks betrayed a want of re&s;t, and indeed he had &s;uffered during the night a degree of angui&s;h from his arm, which it was an effort
<PB N="179" REF="178">
of &s;ome re&s;olution to endure in &s;ilence. It was now &s;welled and &s;omewhat inflamed, and this might in &s;ome degree be attributed to the effect of Madam La Luc's bal&s;am, who&s;e re&s;torative qualities had for once failed. The whole family &s;ympathi&s;ed with his &s;ufferings, and Madame, at the reque&s;t of M. Verneuil, abandoned her bal&s;am, and &s;ub&s;tituted an emollient fomentation.</P>
<P>From an application of this he, in a &s;hort time, found an abatement of the pain, and returned to the breakfa&s;t table with greater compo&s;ure. The happine&s;s which La Luc felt at &s;eeing his daughter in &s;afety was very apparent, but the warmth of his gratitude towards her pre&s;erver he found it difficult to expre&s;s. Clara &s;poke the genuine emotions of her heart with artle&s;s, but mode&s;t, energy, and te&s;tified &s;incere concern for the &s;ufferings which &s;he had occa&s;ioned M. Verneuil.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure received from the company of his gue&s;t, and the con&s;ideration of the e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervices he had rendered him, co operated with the natural ho&s;pitality of La Luc, and he pre&s;&s;ed M. Verneuil to remain &s;ome time at the chateau&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can never repay the &s;ervices you have done me,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc; <Q REND="inline">"yet I &s;eek to encrea&s;e my obligations to you by reque&s;ting you will prolong your vi&s;it, and thus allow me an opportunity of cultivating your acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="179">
M. Verneuil, who at the time he met La Luc was travelling from Geneva to a di&s;tant part of Savoy, merely for the purpo&s;e of viewing thecountry, being now delighted with his ho&s;t and with every thing around him, willingly accepted the invitation. In this circum&s;tance prudence concurred with inclination, for to have pur&s;ued his journey on hor&s;eback, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, would have been danger|ous, if not impracticable.</P>
<P>The morning was &s;pent in conver&s;ation, in which M. Verneuil di&s;played a mind enriched with ta&s;te, enlightned by &s;cience and enlarged by ob&s;ervation. The &s;ituation of the chateau and the features of the &s;ur|rounding &s;cenery charmed him, and in the eve|ning he found him&s;elf able to walk with La Luc and explore the beauties of this romantic region. As they pa&s;&s;ed through the village, the &s;alutations of the pea&s;ants, in whom love and re&s;pect were equally blended, and their eager inquiries after Clara, bore te&s;timony to the character of La Luc, while his countenance expre&s;&s;ed a &s;erene &s;atisfaction, ari&s;ing from the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their love.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I live &s;urrounded by my children,"</Q> &s;aid he, turning to M. Verneuil, who had no|ticed their eagerne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;uch I con&s;ider my pari&s;hioners. In di&s;charging the duties of my office, I am repaid not only by my own con&s;cience, but by their gratitude. There
<PB N="181" REF="180">
is a luxury in ob&s;erving their &s;imple and hone&s;t love, which I would not exchange for any thing the world calls ble&s;&s;ings."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet the world, Sir, would call the plea&s;ures of which you &s;peak romantic,"</Q> &s;aid M. Verneuil; <Q REND="inline">"for to be &s;en&s;ible of this pure and exqui&s;ite delight exquires a heart untainted with the vicious plea&s;ures of &s;ociety&mdash;plea&s;ures that deaden its fine&s;t feelings and poi&s;on the &s;cource of its true&s;t enjoyments."&mdash;</Q>They pur&s;ued their way along the borders of the lake, &s;ometimes under the &s;hade of hanging woods, and &s;ometimes over hillocks of turf, where the &s;cene opened in all its wild magnificence. M. Verneuil often &s;toped in raptures to ob&s;erve and point out the &s;ingular beauties it exhibited, while La Luc, plea&s;ed with the delight his friend expre&s;&s;ed, &s;urveyed with more than u&s;ual &s;atisfaction the objects which had &s;o often charmed him before. But there was a tender melancholy in the tone of his voice and his countenance, which aro&s;e from the recollection of having often traced tho&s;e &s;cenes, and partook of the plea&s;ure they in&s;pired, with her who had long &s;ince bade them an eternal farewell.</P>
<P>They pre&s;ently quitted the lake, and, winding up a &s;teep a&s;cent between the woods, came after an hour's walk, to a green &s;um|mit, which appeared, among the &s;avage rocks that invironed it, like the blo&s;&s;om on the
<PB N="182" REF="181">
thorn. It was a &s;pot formed for &s;olitary de|light, in&s;piring that &s;oothing tenderne&s;s &s;o dear to the feeling mind, and which calls back to memory the images of pa&s;&s;ed regret, &s;oftened by di&s;tance and endeared by frequent recollection. Wild &s;hrubs grew from the crevices of the rocks beneath, and the high trees of pine and cedar that waved above afforded a melancholy and romantic &s;hade. The &s;ilence of the &s;cene was interrupted only by the breeze as it rolled over the woods, and by the &s;olitary notes of the birds that inhabited the cliffs.</P>
<P>From this point the eye commanded an entire view of tho&s;e maje&s;tic and &s;ublime alps who&s;e a&s;pect fills the &s;oul with emotions of inde&s;cribable awe, and &s;eems to lift it to a nobler nature. The village, and the chateau of La Luc appeared in the bo&s;om of the mountains, a peaceful retreat from the &s;torms that gathered on their tops. All the faculties of M. Verneuil were ab&s;orbed in admiration, and he was for &s;ome time quite &s;ilent; at length, bur&s;ting into a rhap&s;ody, he turned, and would have addre&s;&s;ed La Luc, when he perceived him at a di&s;tance leaning again&s;t a ru&s;tick urn, over which drooped, in beau|tiful luxuriance, the weeping willow.</P>
<P>As he approached, La Luc quitted his po|&s;ition, and advanced to meet him, while M. Verneuil inquired upon what occa&s;ion the
<PB N="183" REF="182">
urn had been erected. La Luc, unable to an&s;wer, pointed to it, and walked &s;ilently away, and M. Verneuil, approaching the urn, read the following in&s;cription.
<Q>TO<LB>THE MEMORY OF CLARA LA LUC.<LB>THIS URN<LB>IS ERECTED ON THE SPOT WHICH SHE LOVED,<LB>IN TESTIMONY OF THE AFFECTION OF<LB>A HUSBAND.</Q></P>
<P>M. Verneuil now comprehended the whole, and, feeling for his friend, was hurt that he had noticed this monument of his grief. He rejoined La Luc, who was &s;tanding on the point of the eminence contemplating the land&s;cape below with an air more placid, and touched with the &s;weet|ne&s;s of piety and re&s;ignation. He perceived that M. Verneuil was &s;ome what di&s;concert|ed, and he &s;ought to remove his unea&s;ine&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"You will con&s;ider it,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"as a mark of my e&s;teem that I have brought you to this &s;pot. It is never prophaned by the pre&s;ence of the unfeeling. They would deride the faithfulne&s;s of an attach|ment which has &s;o long &s;urvived its ob|jects, and which, in their own brea&s;ts, would quickly have been lo&s;t amid&s;t the
<PB N="184" REF="183">
di&s;&s;ipation of general &s;ociety. I have cheri&s;hed in my heart the remembrance of a woman who&s;e virtues claimed all my love: I have cheri&s;hed it as a trea&s;ure to which I could withdraw from temporary cares and vexations, in the certainty of finding a &s;oothing, though melancholy, comfort."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc pau&s;ed. M. Verneuil expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ympathy he felt, but he knew the &s;a|credne&s;s of &s;orrow, and &s;oon relap&s;ed into &s;i|lence. <Q REND="inline">"One of the brighte&s;t hopes of a future &s;tate,"</Q> re&s;umed La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"is, that we &s;hall meet again tho&s;e whom we have loved upon earth. And perhaps our hap|pine&s;s may be permitted to con&s;i&s;t very much in the &s;ociety of our friends, purified from the frailties of mortality, with the finer affections more &s;weetly attuned, and with the faculties of mind infinitely more elevated and enlarged. We &s;hall then be enabled to comprehend &s;ubjects which are too va&s;t for human conception; to com|prehend, perhaps, the &s;ublimity of that Deity who fir&s;t called us into being. The&s;e views of futurity, my friend, elevate us above the evils of this world, and &s;eem to communicate to us a portion of the nature we contemplate"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Call them not the illu&s;ions of a vi&s;ion|ary brain,"</Q> proceeded La Luc: <Q REND="inline">"I tru&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="184">
in their reality. Of this I am certain, that whether they are illu&s;ions or not, a faith in them ought to be cheri&s;hed for the com|fort it brings to the heart, and reverenced for the dignity it imparts to the mind. Such feelings make a happy and an impor|tant part of our belief in a future exi&s;tence: they give energy to virtue, and &s;tability to principle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> &s;aid M Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"is what I have often felt, and what every ingenuous mind mu&s;t acknowledge."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc and M. Verneuil continued in conver&s;ation till the &s;un had left the &s;cene. The mountains, darkened by twilight, a&s;|&s;umed a &s;ublimer a&s;pect, while the tops of &s;ome of the highe&s;t alps were yet illuminated by the &s;un's rays, and formed a &s;triking con|tra&s;t to the &s;hadowy ob&s;curity of the world below. As they de&s;cended through the woods, and traver&s;ed the margin of the lake, the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olemnity of the hour diffu&s;ed a pen&s;ive &s;weetne&s;s over their minds, and &s;unk them into &s;ilence.</P>
<P>They found &s;upper &s;pread, as was u&s;ual, in the hall, of which the windows open|ed upon a garden, where the flowers might be &s;aid to yield their fragrance in gratitude to the refre&s;hing dews. The windows were embowered with eglantine and other &s;weet &s;hrubs, which hung in
<PB N="186" REF="185">
wild luxuriance around, and formed a beautiful and &s;imple decoration. Clara and Adeline loved to pa&s;s the evenings in this hall, where they had acquired the fir&s;t rudi|ments of a&s;tronomy, and from which they had a wide view of the heavens. La Luc pointed out to them the planets and the fixed &s;tars, explained their laws, and from thence taking occa&s;ion to mingle moral with &s;cien|tific in&s;truction, would often a&s;cend to|wards that great fir&s;t cau&s;e, who&s;e nature &s;oars beyond the gra&s;p of human compre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No &s;tudy,"</Q> he would &s;ometimes &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o much enlarges the mind, or impre&s;&s;es it with &s;o &s;ublime an idea of the Deity, as that of a&s;tronomy. When the imaginati|on launches into the regions of &s;pace, and contemplates the innumerable worlds which are &s;cattered through it, we are lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and awe. This globe ap|appears as a ma&s;s of atoms in the im|men&s;ity of the univer&s;e, and man a mere in&s;ect. Yet how wonderful! that man, who&s;e frame is &s;o diminutive in the &s;cale of being, &s;hould have powers which &s;purn the narrow boundaries of time and place, &s;oar beyond the &s;phere of his exi&s;tence, penetrate the &s;ecret laws of nature, and calculate their progre&s;&s;ive effects."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! how expre&s;&s;ively does this prove
<PB N="187" REF="186">
the &s;pirituality of our Being! Let the ma|teriali&s;t con&s;ider it, and blu&s;h that he has ever doubted."</Q></P>
<P>In this hall the whole family now met at &s;upper, and during the remainder of the evening the conver&s;ation turned upon general &s;ubjects, in which Clara joined in mode&s;t and judicious remark. La Luc had taught her to familiarize her mind to rea&s;oning, and had accu&s;tomed her to deliver her &s;entiments freely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he &s;poke them with a &s;implicity extremely engag|ing, and which convinced her hearers that the love of knowledge, not the va|nity of talking, induced her to conver&s;e. M. Verneuil evidently endeavoured to draw forth her &s;entiments, and Clara, in|tere&s;ted by the &s;ubjects he introduced, a &s;tranger to affectation, and plea&s;ed with the opinions he expre&s;&s;ed, an&s;wered them with frankne&s;s and animation. They re|tired mutually plea&s;ed with each other.</P>
<P>M. Verneuil was about &s;ix and thirty; his figure manly, his countenance frank and engaging. A quick penetrating eye, who&s;e fire was &s;oftened by benevolence, di&s;clo&s;ed the chief traits of his character; he was quick to di&s;cern, but generous to excu&s;e, the follies of mankind; and while no one more &s;en&s;ibly felt an injury, none
<PB N="188" REF="187">
more readily accepted the conce&s;&s;ion of an enemy.</P>
<P>He was by birth a Frenchman. A fortune lately devolved to him, had en|abled him to execute the plan, which his active and inqui&s;itive mind had &s;ug|ge&s;ted, of viewing the mo&s;t remarkable parts of the continent. He was pecu|liarly &s;u&s;ceptible of the beautiful and &s;ub|lime in nature To &s;uch a ta&s;te Switzer|land and the adjacent country was, of all others, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting; and he found the &s;cenery it exhibited infinitely &s;urpa&s;|&s;ing all that his glowing imagination had painted; he &s;aw with the eye of a painter, and felt with the rapture of a poet.</P>
<P>In the habitation of La Luc he met with the ho&s;pitality, the frankne&s;s, and the &s;implicity, &s;o characteri&s;tic of the country: in his venerable ho&s;t he &s;aw the &s;trength of philo&s;ophy united with the fine&s;t tenderne&s;s of humanity&mdash;a phi|lo&s;ophy which taught him to correct his feelings, not to annihilate them; in Clara, the bloom of beauty, with the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of heart; and in Ade|line all the charms of elegance and grace, with a genius de&s;erving of the highe&s;t cul|ture. In this family picture the goodne&s;s of Madame La Luc was not unperceived or forgotten. The chearfulne&s;s and harmony
<PB N="189" REF="188">
that reigned within the chateau was de|lightful; but the philanthropy which, flow|ing from the heart of the pa&s;tor, was diffu&s;ed through the whole village, and united the inhabitants in the &s;weet and firm bonds of &s;ocial compact, was divine. The beauty of its &s;ituation con&s;pired with the&s;e circum|&s;tances to make Leloncourt &s;eem almo&s;t a Paradi&s;e. M. Verneuil &s;ighed that he mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon quit it. <Q REND="inline">"I ought to &s;eek no farther,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"for here wi&s;|wi&s;dom and happine&s;s dwell together."</Q></P>
<P>The admiration was reciprocal; La Luc and his family found them&s;elves much intere&s;ted in M. Verneuil, and looked forward to the time of his depar|ture with regret. So warmly they pre&s;|&s;ed him to prolong his vi&s;it, and &s;o pow|erfully his own inclinations &s;econded theirs, that he accepted the invitation. La Luc omitted no circum&s;tance which might con|tribute to the amu&s;ement of his gue&s;t, who, having in a few days recovered the u&s;e of his arm, they made &s;everal excur&s;ions among the mountains. Adeline and Clara, whom the care of Madame had re&s;tored to her u&s;ual health, were generally of the party.</P>
<P>After &s;pending a week at the chateau, M. Verneuil bade adieu to La Luc and his family; they parted with mutual regret, and the former promi&s;ed that when
<PB N="190" REF="189">
he returned to Geneva, he would take Leloncourt in his way. As he &s;aid this, Adeline, who had for &s;ome time ob&s;erved, with much alarm, La Luc's declining health, looked mournfully on his languid countenance, and uttered a &s;ecret prayer that he might live to receive the vi&s;it of M. Verneuil.</P>
<P>Madame was the only per&s;on who did not lament his departure, &s;he &s;aw that the efforts of her brother to entertain his gue&s;t were more than his pre&s;ent &s;tate of health would admit of, and &s;he rejoiced in the quiet that would now return to him.</P>
<P>But this quiet brought La Luc no re|&s;pite from illne&s;s; the fatigue he had &s;uffered in his late excur&s;ions &s;eemed to have encrea&s;ed his di&s;order, which in a &s;hort time a&s;&s;umed the a&s;pect of a con|&s;umption. Yielding to the &s;olicitations of his family, he went to Geneva for ad|vice, and was there recommended to try the air of Nice.</P>
<P>The journey thither, however, was of con&s;iderable length, and believing his life to be very precarious, he he&s;itated whether to go. He was al&s;o unwilling to leave the duty of his pari&s;h unperformed for &s;o long a period as his health might require; but this was an objection which would not have with|held him from Nice, had his faith in the
<PB N="191" REF="190">
climate been equal to that of his phy&s;i|cians.</P>
<P>His pari&s;hioners felt the life of their pa&s;tor to be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to them. It was a general cau&s;e, and they te&s;tified at once his worth, and their &s;en&s;e of it, by going in a body to &s;olicit him to leave them. He was much affected by this in&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of their attachment. Such a proof of regard, joined with the entreaties of his own family, and a con&s;ideration that for their &s;akes it was a duty to endeavour to prolong his life, was too powerful to be with&s;tood, and he determined to &s;et out for Italy.</P>
<P>It was &s;ettled that Clara and Adeline, who&s;e health La Luc thought required change of air and &s;cene, &s;hould accom|pany him, attended by the faithful Peter.</P>
<P>On the morning of his departure, a large body of his pari&s;hioners a&s;&s;embled round the door to bid him farewell. It was an affect|ing &s;cene; they might meet no more. At length, wiping the tears from his eyes, La Luc &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Let us tru&s;t in God, my friends; he has power to heal all di&s;orders both of body and mind. We &s;hall meet again, if not in this world, I hope in a better. Let our conduct be &s;uch as to en&s;ure that better."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;obs of his people prevented any reply. There was &s;carcely a dry eye in
<PB N="192" REF="191">
the village; for there was &s;carcely an inhabitant of it that was not now a&s;&s;em|bled in the pre&s;ence of La Luc. He &s;hook hands with them all, <Q REND="inline">"Farewell, my friends,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hall meet again."</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"God grant we may,"</Q> &s;aid they with one voice of fervent petition.</P>
<P>Having mounted his hor&s;e, and Clara and Adeline being ready, they took a la&s;t leave of Madame La Luc, and quitted the chateau. The people, unwilling to leave La Luc, the greater part of them accompanied him to &s;ome di&s;tance from the village. As he moved &s;lowly on he ca&s;t a la&s;t lingering look at his little home, where he had &s;pent &s;o many peaceful years, and which he now gazed on, per|haps for the la&s;t time, and tears ro&s;e to his eyes; but he checked them. Every &s;cene of the adjacent country called up, as he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ome tender remembrance. He looked towards the &s;pot con&s;ecrated to the memory of his decea&s;ed wife; the dewy vapours of the morning veiled it. La Luc felt the di&s;appointment more deep|ly, perhaps, than rea&s;on could ju&s;tify; but tho&s;e who know from experience how much the imagination loves to dwell on any object, however remotely con|nected with that of our tenderne&s;s, will feel with him. This was an object round
<PB N="193" REF="192">
which the affections of La Luc had &s;ettled them&s;elves; it was a memorial to the eye, and the view of it awakened more forcibly in the memory every tender idea that could a&s;&s;ociate with the primary &s;ubject of his regard. In &s;uch ca&s;es fancy gives to the illu&s;ions of &s;trong affection, the &s;tamp of reality, and they are cheri&s;hed by the heart with romantic fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>His people accompanied him for near a mile from the village, and could &s;carce|ly then be prevailed on to leave him; at length he once more bade them farewell, and went on his way, followed by their prayers and ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>La Luc and his little party travelled &s;lowly on, &s;unk in pen&s;ive &s;ilence&mdash;a &s;i|lence too plea&s;ingly &s;ad to be &s;oon relin|qui&s;hed, and which they indulged with|out fear of interruption. The &s;olitary grandeur of the &s;cenes through which they pa&s;&s;ed, and the &s;oothing murmur of the pines that waved above, aided this &s;oft luxury of meditation.</P>
<P>They proceeded by ea&s;y &s;tages; and after travelling for &s;ome days among the romantic mountains and green vallies of Piedmont, they entered the rich coun|ty of Nice. The gay and luxuriant views which now opened upon the travellers as they wound among the hills, appeared
<PB N="194" REF="193">
like &s;cenes of fairy enchantment, or tho&s;e produced by the lonely vi&s;ions of the Poets. While the &s;piral &s;ummits of the mountains exhibited the &s;nowy &s;everity of winter, the pine, the cypre&s;s, the olive, and the myr|tle &s;haded their &s;ides with the green tints of &s;pring, and groves of orange, lemon, and citron, &s;pread over their feet the full glow of autumn. As they advanced the &s;cenery became &s;till more diver&s;ified; and at length, between the receding heights, Adeline caught a glimp&s;e of the di&s;tant waters of the Mediterranean, fading into the blue and cloudle&s;s horizon. She had never till now &s;een the ocean; and this tran&s;ient view of it rou&s;ed her imagination, and made her watch impatiently for a nearer pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>It was towards the clo&s;e of day when the travellers, winding round an abrupt projection of that range of Alps which crowns the amphitheatre that environs Nice, looked down upon the green hills that &s;tretch to the &s;hores, on the city, and its antient ca&s;tle, and on the wide waters of the Medi|terranean; with the mountains of Cor&s;ica in the farthe&s;t di&s;tance. Such a &s;weep of &s;ea and land, &s;o varied with the gay, the magnificent, and the awful, would have fixed any eye in admiration:&mdash;for Adeline and Clara novelty and enthu&s;ia&s;m added their charms to the pro&s;pect. The &s;oft and
<PB N="195" REF="194">
&s;alubrious air &s;eemed to welcome La Luc to this &s;miling region, and the &s;erene at|mo&s;phere to promi&s;e invariable &s;ummer. They at length de&s;cended upon the little plain where &s;tands the city of Nice, and which was the mo&s;t exten&s;ive piece of level ground they had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince they entered the county. Here, in the bo&s;om of the mountains, &s;heltered from the north and the ea&s;t, where the we&s;tern gales alone &s;eemed to breathe, all the blooms of &s;pring and the riches of autumn were united. Trees of myrtle bordered the road, which wound among groves of orange, lemon, and bergamot, who&s;e delicious fragrance came to the &s;en&s;e mingled with the breath of ro&s;es and carnations that blo&s;&s;omed in their &s;hade. The gently &s;welling hills that ro&s;e from the plain were covered with vines, and crowned with cypre&s;&s;es, olives and date trees; beyond, there appeared the &s;weep of lofty mountains whence the travellers had de&s;cended, and whence ro&s;e the little river Paglion, &s;woln by the &s;nows that melt on their &s;ummits, and which, after meander|ing through the plain, wa&s;hes the walls of Nice, where it falls into the Mediterranean. In this blooming region Adeline ob&s;erved that the countenances of the pea&s;ants, mea|gre and di&s;contented, formed a melancholy contra&s;t to the face of the country, and &s;he
<PB N="196" REF="195">
lamented again the effects of an arbitrary government, where the bounties of nature, which were de&s;igned for all, are monopoliz|ed by a few, and the many are &s;uffered to &s;tarve tantalized by &s;urrounding plenty.</P>
<P>The city lo&s;t much of its enchantment on a nearer approach: its narrow &s;treets and &s;habby hou&s;es but ill an&s;wered the ex|pectation which a di&s;tant view of its ram|parts and its harbour, gay with ve&s;&s;els &s;eemed to authori&s;e. The appearance of the inn at which La Luc now alighted did not contribute to &s;often his di&s;appointment; but if he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;uch indifferent accommodation at the inn of a town cele|brated as the re&s;ort of valetudinarians, he was &s;till more &s;o when he learned the diffi|culty of procuring furni&s;hed lodgings.</P>
<P>After much &s;earch he procured apartments in a &s;mall but plea&s;ant hou&s;e, &s;ituated a lit|tle way out of the town: it had a garden, and a terrace which overlooked the &s;ea, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an air of neatne&s;s very unu&s;ual in the hou&s;es of Nice. He agreed to board with the family, who&s;e table like|wi&s;e accommodated a gentleman and lady, their lodgers, and thus he became a tem|porary inhabitant of this charming climate.</P>
<P>On the following morning Adeline ro&s;e at an early hour, eager to indulge the new and &s;ublime emotion with which a view of
<PB N="197" REF="196">
the ocean in&s;pired her, and walked with Clara toward the hills that afforded a more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. They pur&s;ued their way for &s;ome time between high embowering banks, till they arrived at an eminence, whence
<Q><L>"Heaven, earth, ocean, &s;mil'd!"</L></Q></P>
<P>They &s;at down on a point of rock, over|&s;hadowed by lofty palm-trees, to contem|plate at lei&s;ure the magnificent &s;cene. The &s;un was ju&s;t emerged from the &s;ea, over which his rays &s;hed a flood of light, and darted a thou&s;and brilliant tints on the va|pours that a&s;cended the horizon, and floated there in light clouds, leaving the bo&s;om of the waters below clear as chry&s;tal, except where the white &s;urges were &s;een to beat upon the rocks; and di&s;covering the di&s;|tant &s;ails of the fi&s;hing boats, and the far di&s;tant highlands of Cor&s;ica, tinted with aetherial blue. Clara, after &s;ome time, drew forth her pencil, but threw it a&s;ide in de&s;pair. Adeline, as they returned home through a romantic glen, when her &s;en&s;es were no longer ab&s;orbed in the contempla|tion of this grand &s;cenery, and when its images floated on her memory, only, in &s;oftened colours, repeated the following lines:

<P>La Luc in his walks met with &s;ome &s;en|&s;ible and agreeable companions, who like him&s;elf came to Nice in &s;earch of health. Of the&s;e he &s;oon formed a &s;mall but plea&s;ant &s;ociety, among whom was a Frenchman, who&s;e wild manners, marked with a deep and intere&s;ting melancholy, had particular|ly attracted La Luc. He very &s;eldom men|tioned him&s;elf, or any circum&s;tance that might lead to a knowledge of his family, but on other &s;ubjects conver&s;ed with frankne&s;s
<PB N="199" REF="198">
and much intelligence. La Luc had fre|quently invited him to his lodgings, but he had always declined the invitation, and this in a manner &s;o gentle as to di&s;arm di&s;plea|&s;ure, and convince La Luc that his refu|&s;al was the con&s;equence of a certain dejec|tion of mind which made him reluctant to meet other &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription which La Luc had given of this foreigner had excited the curio&s;ity of Clara; and the &s;ympathy which the un|fortunate feel for each other called forth the commi&s;eration of Adeline; for that he was unfortunate &s;he could not doubt. On their return from an evening walk La Luc point|ed out the chevalier, and quickened his pace to overtake him. Adeline was for a moment impelled to follow, but delicacy checked her &s;teps, &s;he knew how painful the pre&s;ence of a &s;tranger often is to a wounded mind, and forbore to intrude her|&s;elf on his notice for the &s;ake of only &s;atis|fying an idle curio&s;ity. She turned there|fore, into another path; but the delicacy which now prevented the meeting, acci|dent in a few days defeated, and La Luc introduced the &s;tranger. Adeline received him with a &s;oft &s;mile, but endeavoured to re&s;train the expre&s;&s;ion of pity which her features had involuntarily a&s;&s;umed; &s;he wi&s;h|ed
<PB N="200" REF="199">
him not to know that &s;he ob&s;erved he was unhappy.</P>
<P>After this interview he no longer rejected the invitations of La Luc, but made him frequent vi&s;its, and often accompanied Ade|line and Clara in their rambles. The mild and &s;en&s;ible conver&s;ation of the former &s;eem|ed to &s;oothe his mind, and in her pre&s;ence he frequently conver&s;ed with a degree of ani|mation which La Luc till then had not ob|&s;erved in him. Adeline too derived from the &s;imilarity of their ta&s;te, and his in|telligent conver&s;ation, a degree of &s;atisfacti|on which contributed, with the compa&s;&s;ion his dejection in&s;pired, to win her confi|dence, and &s;he conver&s;ed with an ea&s;y frankne&s;s rather unu&s;ual to her.</P>
<P>His vi&s;its &s;oon became more frequent. He walked with La Luc and his family; he attended them on their little excur&s;ions to view tho&s;e magni&s;icent remains of Ro|man antiquity which enrich the neighbour|hood of Nice. When the ladies &s;at at home and worked, he enlivened the hours by reading to them, and they had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve his &s;pirits &s;omewhat relieved from the heavy melancholy that had oppre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>M. Amand was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic. Clara had not forgot to bring her beloved lute: he would &s;ometimes &s;trike the chords
<PB N="201" REF="200">
in the mo&s;t &s;weet and mournful &s;ymphonies, but never could be prevailed on to play. When Adeline or Clara played, he would &s;it in deep reverie, and lo&s;t to every object around him, except when he fixed his eyes in mournful gaze on Adeline, and a &s;igh would &s;ometimes e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>One evening Adeline having excu&s;ed her|&s;elf from accompanying La Luc and Clara in a vi&s;it to a neghbouring family, &s;he re|tired to the terrace of the garden, which overlooked the &s;ea, and as &s;he viewed the tranquil &s;plendour of the &s;etting &s;un, and his glories reflected on the poli&s;hed &s;urface of the waves, &s;he touched the &s;trings of the lute in &s;ofte&s;t harmony, her voice accom|panying it with words which &s;he had one day written after having read that rich ef|fu&s;ion of Shake&s;peare's genius, "A Mid|&s;ummer Night's Dream."

<P>Mon&s;ieur Amand pau&s;ed: he &s;eemed much oppre&s;&s;ed, and at length, bur&s;ting into tears, laid down the in&s;trument and walked ab|ruptly away to the farther end of the terrace. Adeline, without &s;eeming to ob&s;erve his agitation, ro&s;e and leaned upon the wall, below which a group of fi&s;hermen were bu&s;ily employed in drawing a net. In a few moments he returned, with a compo&s;ed and &s;oftened countenance. <Q REND="inline">"Forgive this abrupt conduct,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"I know not how to apologize for it but by owning its cau&s;e.

&s;orrows! &s;he is gone, and never to return! And you, Adeline&mdash;you"&mdash;</Q>He checked his &s;peech; and Adeline, turning on him a look of mournful regard, ob&s;erved a wildne&s;s in his eyes which alarmed her. <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e recollections are too painful,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"in a gentle voice; let us return to the hou&s;e; M La Luc is probably come home"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"O no!"</Q> replied M.

She took up the lute to go, and pa&s;&s;ed her fingers lightly over the chords. The &s;ounds recalled his &s;catter|ed &s;en&s;es: he rai&s;ed his eyes, and fixed them in long un&s;ettled gaze upon hers. <Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t I leave you here?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling, and &s;tanding in an attitude to depart&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I entreat you to play again the air I heard ju&s;t now,"</Q> &s;aid M. Amand, in a hurried voice. <Q REND="inline">"Certainly;"</Q> and &s;he immediately began to play. He leaned again&s;t a palm tree in an attitude of deep attention, and as the &s;ounds langui&s;hed on the air, his features gradually lo&s;t their wild expre&s;&s;ion, and he
<PB N="206" REF="205">
melted into tears. He continued to weep &s;ilently till the &s;ong concluded, and it was &s;ome time before he recovered voice enough to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Adeline, I cannot thank you for this good|ne&s;s. My mind has recovered its bias, you have &s;oothed a broken heart. Increa&s;e the kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn me by pro|mi&s;ing never to mention what you have witne&s;&s;ed this evening, and I will endeavour never again to wound your &s;en&s;ibility by a &s;i|milar offence."&mdash;</Q>Adeline gave the required promi&s;e; and M. Amand, pre&s;&s;ing her hand, with a melancholy &s;mile, hurried from the garden, and &s;he &s;aw him no more that night.</P>
<P>La Luc had been near a fortnight at Nice, and his health, in&s;tead of amending, &s;eemed rather to decline, yet he wi&s;hed to make a longer experiment of the climate. The air, which failed to re&s;tore her venerable friend, revived Adeline, and the variety and novelty of the &s;urrounding &s;cenes amu&s;ed her mind, though, &s;ince they could not obliterate the memory of pa&s;t, or &s;uppre&s;s the pang of pre&s;ent affection, they were ineffectual to di&s;&s;ipate the &s;ick languor of melancholy. Company, by compelling her to withdraw her attention from the &s;ubject of her &s;or|row, afforded her a tran&s;ient relief, but the violence of the exertion generally left her more depre&s;&s;ed. It was in the &s;tillne&s;s of &s;olitude, in the tranquil ob&s;ervance of beau|tiful
<PB N="207" REF="206">
nature, that her mind recovered its tone, and indulging the pen&s;ive inclination now become habitual to it, was &s;oothed and fortified. Of all the grand objects which nature had exhibited, the ocean in&s;pired her with the mo&s;t &s;ublime admiration. She loved to wander alone on its &s;hores, and, when &s;he could e&s;cape &s;o long from the duties or the forms of &s;ociety, &s;he would &s;it for hours on the beach watching the rolling waves, and li&s;tening to their dying mur|mur, till her &s;oftened fancy recalled long lo&s;t &s;cenes, and re&s;tored the image of Theodore, when tears of de&s;pondency too often followed tho&s;e of pity and regret. But the&s;e vi&s;ions of memory, painful as they were, no longer excited that frenzy of grief they formerly awakened in Savoy; the &s;harpne&s;s of mi&s;ery was pa&s;&s;ed, though its heavy influence was not perhaps le&s;s powerful. To the&s;e &s;olitary indulgencies generally &s;ucceeded calmne&s;s, and what Adeline endeavoured to believe was re&s;igna|tion.</P>
<P>She u&s;ually ro&s;e early, and walked down to the &s;hore to enjoy, in the cool and &s;ilent hours of the morning, the cheer|ing beauty of nature, and inhale the pure &s;ea-breeze. Every object then &s;miled in fre&s;h and lively colours. The blue &s;ea, the brilliant &s;ky, the di&s;tant fi&s;hing boats,
<PB N="208" REF="207">
with their white &s;ails, and the voices of the fi&s;hermen borne at intervals on the air, were circum&s;tances which re-animated her &s;pirits, and in one of her rambles, yielding to that ta&s;te for poetry which had &s;eldom for&s;aken her, &s;he repeated the follow|ing lines.

<P>During &s;everal days &s;ucceeding that on which M. Amand had di&s;clo&s;ed the cau&s;e of his melancholy, he did not vi&s;it La Luc. At length Adeline met him in one of her &s;olitary rambles on the &s;hore. He was pale and dejected, and &s;eemed much agitated when he ob&s;erved her; &s;he there|fore endeavoured to avoid him, but he ad|vanced with quickened &s;teps and acco&s;ted her. He &s;aid it was his intention to leave Nice in a few days. <Q REND="inline">"I have found no benefit from the climate,"</Q> added M. Amand; <Q REND="inline">"Alas! what climate can re|lieve the &s;ickne&s;s of the heart! I go to lo&s;e in the varieties of new &s;cenes the re|membrance of pa&s;t happine&s;s; yet the effort is vain; I am every where equally re&s;tle&s;s and unhappy."</Q> Adeline tried to encourage him to hope much from time and change of place. <Q REND="inline">"Time <HI>will</HI> blunt the &s;harpe&s;t edge of &s;orrow,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I know it from experience."</Q> Yet while &s;he &s;poke, the tears in her eyes contradicted the a&s;&s;ertion of
<PB N="211" REF="210">
her lips. <Q REND="inline">"You have been unhappy, Adeline!&mdash;Yes&mdash;I knew it from the fir&s;t. The &s;mile of pity which you gave me, a&s;&s;ured me that you knew what it was to &s;uffer."</Q> The de&s;ponding air with which he &s;poke renewed her apprehen&s;ion of a &s;cene &s;imilar to the one &s;he had lately wit|ne&s;&s;ed, and &s;he changed the &s;ubject, but he &s;oon returned to it. <Q REND="inline">"You bid me hope much from time!&mdash;My wife!&mdash;My dear wife!"&mdash;</Q>his tongue faultered&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is now many months &s;ince I lo&s;t her&mdash;yet the moment of her death &s;eems but as ye&s;terday."</Q> Adeline faintly &s;miled. <Q REND="inline">"You can &s;carcely judge of the effect of time yet, you have much to hope for."</Q> He &s;hook his head. <Q REND="inline">"But I am again intruding my misfortunes on your notice; forgive this perpetual ego|ti&s;m. There is a comfort in the pity of the good &s;uch as nothing el&s;e can impart; this mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e; may you, Adeline, never want it. Ah! tho&s;e tears&mdash;"</Q> Adeline ha&s;tily dried them. M. Amand forbore to pre&s;s the &s;ubject, and immediately began to conver&s;e on indifferent topics. They returned towards the chateau, but La Luc being from home, M. Amand took leave at the door. Adeline retired to her chamber, oppre&s;&s;ed by her
<PB N="212" REF="211">
own &s;orrows and tho&s;e of her amiable friend.</P>
<P>Near three weeks had now elap&s;ed at Nice, during which the di&s;order of La Luc &s;eemed rather to encrea&s;e than to abate, when his phy&s;ician very hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed the little hope he entertained from the climate, and advi&s;ed him to try the effect of a &s;ea voyage, adding, that if the experiment failed, even the air of Montpellier appeared to him more likely to afford relief than that of Nice. La Luc received this di&s;intere&s;ted advice with a mixture of gratitude and di&s;ap|pointment. The circum&s;tances which had made him reluctant to quit Savoy, rendered him yet more &s;o to protract his ab&s;ence, and encrea&s;e his expences; but the ties of affection that bound him to his family, and the love of life, which &s;o &s;eldom leaves us, again prevailed over inferior con&s;iderations, and he determin|ed to coa&s;t the Mediterranean as far as Lan|guedoc, where, if the voyage did not an|&s;wer his expectations, he would land and proceed to Montpellier.</P>
<P>When M. Amand learned that La Luc de&s;igned to quit Nice in a few days, he de|termined not to leave it before him. Dur|ing this interval he had not &s;ufficient re|&s;olution to deny him&s;elf the frequent con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="213" REF="212">
of Adeline, though her pre&s;ence, by reminding him of his lo&s;t wife, gave him more pain than comfort. He was the &s;econd &s;on of a French gentleman of family, and had been married about a year to a lady to whom he had long been attached when &s;he died in her lying-in. The infant &s;oon followed its mother, and left the di&s;|con&s;olate father abandoned to grief, which had preyed &s;o heavily on his health, that his phy&s;ician thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him to Nice. From the air of Nice, however, he had derived no benefit, and he now determined to travel farther into Italy, though he no longer felt any intere&s;t in tho&s;e charming &s;cenes which in happier days, and with her whom he never cea&s;ed to lament, would have afforded him the highe&s;t degree of mental luxury&mdash;now he &s;ought only to e&s;cape from him&s;elf, or rather from the image of her who had once con&s;tituted his true&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>La Luc having laid his plan, hired a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and in a few days embarked, with a &s;ick hope bidding adieu to the &s;hores of Italy and the towering alps, and &s;eeking on a new element the health which had hitherto mocked his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>M. Amand took a melancholy leave of his new friends, whom he attended to the &s;ea &s;ide. When he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Adeline
<PB N="214" REF="213">
on board, his heart was too full to &s;uffer him to &s;ay farewell; but he &s;tood long on the beach pur&s;uing with his eyes her cour&s;e over the waters, and waving his hand, till tears dimmed his &s;ight. The breeze wafted the ve&s;&s;el gently from the coa&s;t, and Adeline &s;aw her&s;elf &s;urround|ed by the undulating waves of the ocean. The &s;hore appeared to recede, its moun|tains to le&s;&s;en, the gay colours of its land&s;cape to melt into each other, and in a &s;hort time the figure of M. Amand was &s;een no more: the town of Nice, with its ca&s;tle and harbour, next faded away in di&s;|tance, and the purple tint of the moun|tains was at length all that remained on the verge of the horizon She &s;ighed as &s;he gazed, and her eyes filled with tears. <Q REND="inline">"So vani&s;hed my pro&s;pect of happi|ne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"and my future view is like the wa&s;te of waters that &s;urround me."</Q> Her heart was full, and &s;he retired from ob&s;ervation to a remote part of the deck, where &s;he in|dulged her tears as &s;he watched the ve&s;|&s;el cut its way through the liquid gla&s;s. The water was &s;o tran&s;parent that &s;he &s;aw the &s;un-beams playing at a con&s;ide|rable depth, and fi&s;h of various colours glance athwart the current. Innumera|ble marine plants &s;pread their vigorous
<PB N="215" REF="214">
leaves on the rocks below, and the rich|ne&s;s of their verdure formed a beautiful contra&s;t to the glowing &s;carlet of the co|ral that branched be&s;ide them.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant coa&s;t, at length, entirely di&s;appeared. Adeline gazed with an emotion the mo&s;t &s;ublime, on the bound|le&s;s expan&s;e of waters that &s;pread on all &s;ides: &s;he &s;eemed as if launched into a new world; the grandeur and immen|&s;ity of the view a&s;toni&s;hed and over|powered her: for a moment &s;he doubted the truth of the compa&s;s, and believed it to be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the ve&s;&s;el to find its way over the pathle&s;s waters to any &s;hore. And when &s;he con&s;idered that a plank alone &s;eparated her from death, a &s;en&s;ation of unmixed terror &s;u|per&s;eded that of &s;ublimity, and &s;he ha&s;|tily turned her eyes from the pro&s;pect, and her thoughts from the &s;ubject.</P>

terrors of the Marquis de Montalt, &s;he &s;o anxiou&s;ly endeavoured to anticipate her future de&s;tiny. She then, as now, had watched the fall of evening and the fading pro&s;pect, and &s;he remembred what a de&s;olate feeling had accompanied the impre&s;&s;ion which tho&s;e objects made. She had then no friends&mdash;no a&s;ylum&mdash;no certainty of e&s;caping the pur&s;uit of her enemy. Now &s;he had found affectionate friends&mdash;a &s;ecure retreat&mdash;and was delivered from the terrors &s;he then &s;uf|fered&mdash;but &s;till &s;he was unhappy. The remembrance of Theodore&mdash;of Theodore who had loved her &s;o truly, who had encountred and &s;uffered &s;o much for her &s;ake, and of who&s;e fate &s;he was now as ignorant as when &s;he traver&s;ed the Rhone, was an ince&s;&s;ant pang to her heart. She &s;eemed to be more remote than ever from the po&s;&s;ibility of hear|ing of him. Sometimes a faint hope cro&s;&s;ed her that he had e&s;caped the malice of his per&s;ecutor; but when &s;he con&s;idered the inveteracy and power of the latter, and the heinous light in which the law regards an a&s;&s;ault upon a &s;uperior officer, even this poor hope vani&s;hed, and left her to tears and an|gui&s;h, &s;uch as this reverie, which began with a &s;en&s;ation of only gentle melancholy, now led to. She continued to mu&s;e till the moon aro&s;e from the bo&s;om of the ocean, and &s;hed her trembling lu&s;tre upon the waves,
<PB N="219" REF="218">
diffu&s;ing peace, and making &s;ilence more &s;olemn; beaming a &s;oft light on thewhite &s;ails, and throwing upon the waters the tall &s;hadow of the ve&s;&s;el, which now &s;eemed to glide along unoppo&s;ed by any current. Her tears had &s;omewhat relieved the angui&s;h of her mind, and &s;he again repo&s;ed in placid me|lancholy, when a &s;train of &s;uch tender and entrancing &s;weetne&s;s &s;tole on the &s;ilence of the hour, that it &s;eemed more like cele&s;tial than mortal mu&s;ick&mdash;&s;o &s;oft, &s;o &s;oothing, it &s;unk upon her ear, that it recalled her from mi&s;ery to hope and love. She wept again&mdash;but the&s;e were tears which &s;he would not have exchanged for mirth and joy. She looked round, but perceived neither &s;hip or boat; and as the undulating &s;ounds &s;welled on the di&s;tant air, &s;he thought they came from the &s;hore. Sometimes the breeze wa&s;ted them away, and again returned them in tones of the mo&s;t langui&s;hing &s;oftne&s;s. The links of the air thus broken, it was mu&s;ic rather than melody that &s;he caught, till, the pilot gradually &s;teering nearer the coa&s;t, &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the notes of a &s;ong familiar to her ear. She endeavoured to recollect where &s;he had heard it, but in vain; yet her heart beat almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly with a &s;omething re|&s;embling hope. Still &s;he li&s;tened, till the breeze again &s;tole the &s;ounds. With regret &s;he now perceived that the ve&s;&s;el was moving
<PB N="220" REF="219">
from them, and at length they trembled faintly on the waves, &s;unk away at di&s;tance, and were heard no more. She remained upon the deck a con&s;iderable time, unwilling to relinqui&s;h the expectation of hearing them again, and their &s;weetne&s;s &s;till vibrating on her fancy, and at length retired to the cabin oppre&s;&s;ed by a degree of di&s;appointment which the occa&s;ion did not appear to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>La Luc grew better during the voyage, his &s;pirits revived, and when the ve&s;&s;el en|tered that part of the Mediterranean called the Gulf of Lyons, he was &s;ufficiently ani|mated to enjoy from the deck the noble pro&s;|pect which the &s;weeping &s;hores of Provence, terminating in the far di&s;tant ones of Lan|guedoc, exhibited. Adeline and Clara, who anxiou&s;ly watched his looks, rejoiced in their amendment; and the fond wi&s;hes of the latter already anticipated his perfect recovery. The expectations of Adeline had been too often checked by di&s;appointment to permit her now to indulge an equal degree of hope with that of her friend, yet &s;he con&s;id|ed much in the effect of this voyage.</P>
<P>La Luc amu&s;ed him&s;elf at intervals with di&s;cour&s;ing, and pointing out the &s;ituations of con&s;iderable ports on the coa&s;t, and the mouths of the rivers that, after wandering through Provence, di&s;embogue them&s;elves into the Mediterranean. The Rhone, how|ever, was the only one of much con&s;equence
<PB N="221" REF="220">
which he pa&s;&s;ed. On this object, though it was &s;o di&s;tant that fancy, perhaps, rather than the &s;en&s;e, beheld it, Clara gazed with peculiar plea&s;ure, for it came from the banks of Savoy; and the wave which &s;he thought &s;he perceived, had wa&s;hed the feet of her dear native mountains. The time pa&s;&s;ed with mingled plea&s;ure and improvement as La Luc de&s;cribed to his attentive pupils the manners and commerce of the different in|habitants of the coa&s;t, and the natural hi&s;tory of the country; or as he traced in ima|gination the remote wanderings of rivers to their &s;ource, and delineated the character|i&s;tic beauties of their &s;cenery.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant voyage of a few days, the &s;hores of Provence receded, and that of Lan|guedoc, which had long bounded the di&s;tance, became the grand object of the &s;cene, and the &s;ailors drew near their port. They land|ed in the afternoon at a &s;mall town &s;ituated at the foot of a woody eminence, on the right overlooking the &s;ea, and on the left the rich plains of Languedoc, gay with the pur|ple vine. La Luc determined to defer his journey till the following day, and was di|rected to a &s;mall inn at the extremity of the town where the accomodation, &s;uch as it was, he endeavoured to be contented with.</P>
<P>In the evening the beauty of the hour, and the de&s;ire of exploring new &s;cenes, invited
<PB N="222" REF="221">
Adeline to walk. La Luc was fatigued, and did not go out, and Clara remained with him. Adeline took her way to the woods that ro&s;e from the margin of the &s;ea, and climbed the wild eminence on which they hung. Often as &s;he went &s;he turned her eyes to catch between the dark foliage the blue waters of the bay, the white &s;ail that flitted by, and the trembling gleam of the &s;etting &s;un. When &s;he reached the &s;um|mit, and looked down over the dark tops of the woods on the wide and various pro&s;pect, &s;he was &s;eized with a kind of &s;till rapture im|po&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tood uncon&s;ci|ous of the flight of time, till the &s;un had left the &s;cene, and twilight threw its &s;olemn &s;hade upon the mountains. The &s;ea alone reflect|ed the fading &s;plendour of the We&s;t; its tran|quil &s;urface was partially di&s;turbed by the low wind that crept in tremulous lines along the waters whence ri&s;ing to the woods, it &s;hivered their light leaves, and died away. Adeline re&s;ining her&s;elf to the luxury of &s;weet and tender emotions, repeated the following lines:

<P><PB N="225" REF="224">
The &s;preading du&s;k at length remind|ed Adeline of her di&s;tance from the inn, and that &s;he had her way to find through a wild and lonely wood: &s;he bade adieu to the &s;yren that had &s;o long detained her, and pur&s;ued the path with quick &s;teps. Having followed it for &s;ome time, &s;he became bewildered among the thickets, and the increa&s;ing darkne&s;s did not allow her to judge of the direction &s;he was in. Her apprehen&s;ions heightened her difficulties: &s;he thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of men at &s;ome little di&s;tance, and &s;he in|crea&s;ed her &s;peed till &s;he found her&s;elf on the &s;ea &s;ands over which the woods impend|ed. Her breath was now exhau&s;ted&mdash;&s;he pau&s;ed a moment to recover her&s;elf, and fearfully li&s;tened; but, in&s;tead of the voices of men, &s;he heard faintly &s;welling in the breeze the notes of mournful mu&s;ic.&mdash;Her heart, ever &s;en&s;ible to the impre&s;|&s;ions of melody, melted with the tones, and her fears were for a moment lulled in &s;weet enchantment. Surpri&s;e was &s;oon mingled with delight when, as the &s;ounds advanced, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the tone of that in&s;trument, and the melody of that well-known air, &s;he had heard a few preceding evenings from the &s;hores of Provence. But &s;he had no time for con|jecture&mdash;foot&s;teps approached, and &s;he
<PB N="226" REF="225">
renewed her &s;peed. She was now emerged from the darkne&s;s of the woods, and the moon, which &s;hone bright, exhibited along the level &s;ands the town and port in the di&s;tance. The &s;teps that had followed now came up with her, and &s;he perceived two men, but they pa&s;&s;ed in conver&s;ation without noticing her, and as they pa&s;&s;ed &s;he was certain &s;he recollected the voice of him who was then &s;peaking. Its tones were &s;o familiar to her ear, that &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed at the imperfect memory which did not &s;uffer her to be a&s;&s;ured by whom they were uttered. Another &s;tep now follow|ed, and a rude voice called to her to &s;top. As &s;he ha&s;tily turned her eyes &s;he &s;aw imperfectly by the moonlight a man in a &s;ailor's habit pur&s;uing, while he renewed the call. Impelled by terror, &s;he fled along the &s;ands, but her &s;teps were &s;hort and trembling&mdash;tho&s;e of her pur&s;uer's &s;trong and quick.</P>
<P>She had ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to reach the men who had before pa&s;&s;ed her, and to implore their protection, when her pur&s;uer came up with them, but &s;ud|denly turned into the woods on the left, and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>She had no breath to an&s;wer the in|quiries of the &s;trangers who &s;upported her, till a &s;udden exclamation, and the
<PB N="227" REF="226">
&s;ound of her own name, drew her eyes attentively upon the per&s;on who uttered them, and in the rays which &s;hone &s;trong upon his features, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed M. Verneuil!&mdash;Mutual &s;atisfaction and ex|planation en&s;ued, and when he learned that La Luc and his daughter were at the inn, he felt an increa&s;ed plea&s;ure in con|ducting her thither. He &s;aid that he had accidentally met with an old friend in Savoy, whom he now introduced by the name of Mauron, and who had pre|vailed on him to change his route and accompany him to the &s;hores of the Me|diterranean. They had embarked from the coa&s;t of Provence only a few prece|ding days, and had that evening landed in Languedoc on the e&s;tate of M. Mau|ron. Adeline had now no doubt that it was the flute of M. Verneuil, and which had &s;o often delighted her at Leloncourt, that &s;he had heard on the &s;ea.</P>
<P>When they reached the inn they found La Luc under great anxiety for Adeline, in &s;earch of whom he had &s;ent &s;everal people. Anxiety yielded to &s;urprize and plea&s;ure, when he perceived her with M. Verneuil, who&s;e eyes beamed with unu&s;ual animation on &s;eeing Clara. Af|ter mutual congratulations, M. Verneuil
<PB N="228" REF="227">
ob&s;erved, and lamented, the very indif|ferent accommodation which the inn af|forded his friends, and M. Mauron im|mediately invited them to his chateau with a warmth of ho&s;pitality that over|came every &s;cruple which delicacy or pride could oppo&s;e. The woods that Adeline had traver&s;ed formed a part of his domain, which extended almo&s;t to the inn; but he in&s;i&s;ted that his carriage &s;hould take his gue&s;ts to the chateau, and departed to give orders for their reception. The pre|&s;ence of M. Verneiul, and the kindne&s;s of his friend, gave La Luc an unu&s;ual flow of &s;pirits; he conver&s;ed with a degree of vigour and liveline&s;s to which he had long been unaccu&s;tomed, and the &s;mile of &s;a|tisfaction that Clara gave to Adeline ex|pre&s;&s;ed how much &s;he thought he was al|ready benefited by the voyage. Adeline an&s;wered her look with a &s;mile of le&s;s con|fidence, for &s;he attributed his pre&s;ent anima|tion to a more temporary cau&s;e.</P>
<P>About half an hour after the departure of M. Mauron, a boy who &s;erved as wai|ter brought a me&s;&s;age from a chevalier then at the inn, reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak with Adeline. The man who had pur&s;ued her along the &s;ands in&s;tantly oc|curred to her, and &s;he &s;carcely doubted that the &s;tranger was &s;ome per&s;on belong|ing
<PB N="229" REF="228">
to the Marquis de Montalt, perhaps the Marquis him&s;elf, thought that he &s;hould have di&s;covered her accidentally, in &s;o ob&s;cure a place, and &s;o immediately upon her arrival, &s;eemed very improbable. With trembling lips, and a countenance pale as death, &s;he inquired the name of the chevalier. The boy was not ac|quainted with it. La Luc a&s;ked what &s;ort of a per&s;on he was; but the boy, who under&s;tood little of the art of de&s;cribing, gave &s;uch a confu&s;ed account of him, that Adeline could only learn he was not large, but of the middle &s;tature. This circum&s;tance, however, convincing her it was not the Marquis de Montalt who de&s;ired to &s;ee her, &s;he a&s;ked whe|ther it would be agreeable to La Luc to have the &s;tranger admitted. La Luc &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"By all means;"</Q> and the waiter withdrew. Adeline &s;at in trembling ex|pectation till the door opened, and Louis de la Motte entered the room. He advanced with an embarra&s;&s;ed and melan|choly air, though his countenance had been enlightened with a momentary plea&s;ure when he fir&s;t beheld Adeline&mdash;Adeline, who was &s;till the idol of his heart. After the fir&s;t &s;alutations were over, all apprehen&s;ions of the Marquis being now
<PB N="230" REF="229">
di&s;&s;ipated, &s;he inquired when Louis had &s;een Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I ought rather to a&s;k you that que&s;|tion,"</Q> &s;aid Louis, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"for I believe you have &s;een them &s;ince I have; and the plea&s;ure of meeting you thus is equalled by my &s;urpri&s;e. I have not heard from my father for &s;ome time, owing probably to my re|giment being removed to new quar|ters."</Q></P>
<P>He looked as if he wi&s;hed to be inform|ed with whom Adeline now was; but as this was a &s;ubject upon which it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he could &s;peak in the pre&s;ence of La Luc, &s;he led the conver&s;ation to general topics, after having &s;aid that Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte were well when &s;he left them. Louis &s;poke little, and often looked anxiou&s;ly at Ade|line, while his mind &s;eemed labouring un|der &s;trong oppre&s;&s;ion. She ob&s;erved this, and recollecting the declaration he had made her on the morning of his departure from the Abbey, &s;he attributed his pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ment to the effect of a pa&s;&s;ion yet un&s;ubdued, and did not appear to no|tice it. After he had &s;at near a quarter of an hour, under a &s;truggle of feelings which he could neither conquer or con|cal, he ro&s;e to leave the room, and as
<PB N="231" REF="230">
he pa&s;&s;ed Adeline, &s;aid, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"Do permit me to &s;peak with you alone for five minutes."</Q> She he&s;itated in &s;ome con|fu&s;ion, and then &s;aying there were none but friends pre&s;ent, begged he would be &s;eated.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Excu&s;e me,"</Q> &s;aid he, in the &s;ame low ac|cent; <Q REND="inline">"What I would &s;ay nearly concerns you, and you only.

<P>Louis &s;at for &s;ome moments &s;ilent, and &s;eemingly in great perturbation of mind. At length he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I know not whether to rejoice or to lament at this unexpected meeting, though, if you are in &s;afe hands, I ought certainly to rejoice, however hard the ta&s;k that now falls to my lot.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Who is it you &s;peak of, Sir!"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, with quickne&s;s. Louis ro&s;e from his chair, and walked about the room. <Q REND="inline">"I would prepare you for what I have to &s;ay,"</Q> he re&s;umed, <Q REND="inline">"but upon my &s;oul I am not equal to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I entreat you to keep me no longer in &s;u&s;pence,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, who had a wild idea that it was Theodore he would &s;peak of.

<P><Q REND="inline">"My unhappy friend!"</Q> exclaimed Louis, <Q REND="inline">"O Theodore!"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Theodore!"</Q> faintly articulated Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"he lives then!"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"He does,"</Q> &s;aid Louis, <Q REND="inline">"but"&mdash;</Q>He &s;topped. <Q REND="inline">"&mdash;But what?"</Q> cried Adeline, trembling violently; <Q REND="inline">"If he is living you cannot tell me wor&s;e than my fears &s;ugge&s;t; I entreat you, therefore, not to he&s;itate."&mdash;</Q>Louis re&s;umed his &s;eat, and endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume a collected air, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He is living, Ma|dam, but he is a pri&s;oner, and&mdash;for why

&s;hould I deceive you? I fear he has little to hope in this world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have long feared &s;o, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Ade|line, in a voice of forced compo&s;ure; <Q REND="inline">"you have &s;omething more terrible than this to relate, and I again intreat you will ex|plain your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He has every thing to apprehend from the Marquis de Montalt,"</Q> &s;aid Louis. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! why do I &s;ay to apprehend? His judgment is already fixed&mdash;he is con|demned to die."</Q></P>
<P>At this confirmation of her fears a death|like palene&s;s diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the counte|nance of Adeline; &s;he &s;at motionle&s;s, and attempted to &s;igh, but &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;uf|focated. Terrified at her &s;ituation, and ex|pecting to &s;ee her faint, Louis would have &s;upported her, but with her hand &s;he waved him from her, and was unable to &s;peak. He now called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and La Luc and Clara, with M. Verneuil, informed of Ade|line's indi&s;po&s;ition, were quickly by her &s;ide.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of their voices &s;he looked up, and &s;eemed to recollect her&s;elf, when utter|ing a heavy &s;igh &s;he bur&s;t into tears. La Luc rejoiced to &s;ee her weep, encouraged her tears, which, after &s;ome time, relieved her, and when &s;he was able to &s;peak, &s;he de&s;ired to go back to La Luc's parlour. Louis attended her thither; when &s;he was better
<PB N="234" REF="233">
he would have withdrawn, but La Luc begged he would &s;tay.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are perhaps a relation of this young lady, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and may have brought news of her father."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o, Sir,"</Q> replied Louis, he&s;itat|ing.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This gentleman,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, who had now recollected her di&s;&s;ipated thoughts, <Q REND="inline">"is the &s;on of the M. La Motte, whom you may have heard me mention."&mdash;</Q>Louis &s;eemed &s;hocked to be declared the &s;on of a man that had once acted &s;o unworthily towards Ade|line, who, in&s;tantly perceiving the pain her words occa&s;ioned, endeavoured to &s;often their effect by &s;aying that La Motte had &s;aved her from imminent danger, and had afforded her an a&s;ylum for many months. Adeline &s;at in a &s;tate of dread|ful &s;olitude to know the particulars of Theodore's &s;ituation, yet could not ac|quire courage to renew the &s;ubject in the pre&s;ence of La Luc; &s;he ventured, how|ever, to a&s;k Louis if his own regiment was quartered in the town.</P>
<P>He replied that his regiment lay at Vaceau, a French town on the frontiers of Spain; that he had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed a part of the Gulph of Lyons, and was on his way to Savoy, whither he &s;hould &s;et out early in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="234">
<Q REND="inline">"We are lately come from thence,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"may I a&s;k to what part of Savoy you are going?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"To Lelon|court,"</Q> he replied.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To Lelon|court!"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, in &s;ome &s;ur|prize.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am a &s;tranger to the country,"</Q> re&s;umed Louis; <Q REND="inline">"but I go to &s;erve my friend. You &s;eem to know Lelon|court."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"I do indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Ade|line.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You probably know then that M. La Luc lives there, and will gue&s;s the motive of my journey."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O heavens! is it po&s;&s;ible?"</Q> exclaim|ed Adeline&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;&s;ible that Theo|dore Peyrou is a relation of M. La Luc!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Theodore! what of my &s;on?"</Q> a&s;k|ed La Luc, in &s;urprize and apprehen|&s;ion.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Your &s;on!"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, in a trembling voice, <Q REND="inline">"your &s;on!"&mdash;</Q>The a&s;toni&s;hment and angui&s;h depictured on her countenance increa&s;ed the apprehen|&s;ions of this unfortunate father, and he renewed his que&s;tion. But Adeline was totally unable to an&s;wer him; and the di&s;tre&s;s of Louis, on thus unexpectedly di&s;covering the father of his unhappy friend, and knowing that it was his ta&s;k to di&s;clo&s;e the fate of his &s;on, deprived him for &s;ome time of all power of utterance, and La Luc and Clara, who&s;e fears were
<PB N="236" REF="235">
every in&s;tant heightened by this dreadful &s;ilence, continued to repeat their que&s;|tions.</P>
<P>At length a &s;en&s;e of th e approaching &s;ufferings of the good La Luc overcoming every other feeling, Adeline recovered &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to try to &s;of|ten the intelligence Louis had to com|municate, and to conduct Clara to ano|ther room. Here &s;he collected re&s;olution to tell her, and with much tender con&s;ide|ration, the circum&s;tances of her brother's &s;ituation, concealing only her knowledge of his &s;entence being already pronoun|ced. This relation nece&s;&s;arily included the mention of their attachment, and in the friend of her heart Clara di&s;covered the innocent cau&s;e of her brother's de|&s;truction. Adeline al&s;o learned the oc|ca&s;ion of that circum&s;tance which had contributed to keep her ignorant of Theodore's relation&s;hip to La Luc; &s;he was told the former had taken the name of Peyrou, with an e&s;tate which had been left him about a year before by a relation of his mother's upon that con|dition. Theodore had been de&s;igned for the church, but his di&s;po&s;ition inclined him to a more active life than the clerical habit would admit of, and on his acce&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="237" REF="236">
to this e&s;tate he had entered into the &s;ervice of the French King.</P>
<P>In the few and interrupted interviews which had been allowed them at Caux, Theodore had mentioned his family to Adeline only in general terms, and thus, when they were &s;o &s;uddenly &s;eparated, had, without de&s;igning it, left her in ignorance of his father's name and place of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The &s;acredne&s;s and delicacy of Ade+line's grief, which had never permitted her to mention the &s;ubject of it even to Clara, had &s;ince contributed to deceive her.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s of Clara, on learning the &s;ituation of her brother, could en|dure no re&s;traint; Adeline, who had commanded her feelings &s;o as to impart this intelligence with tolerable compo|&s;ure, only by a &s;trong effort of mind, was now almo&s;t overwhelmed by her own and Clara's accumulated &s;uffering. While they wept forth the angui&s;h of their hearts, a &s;cene, if po&s;&s;ible, more affecting pa&s;&s;ed be|tween La Luc and Louis, who perceived it was nece&s;&s;ary to inform him, though cautiou&s;ly and by degrees, of the full ex|tent of his calamity. He therefore told La Luc, that though Theodore had been fir&s;t tried for the offence of having quit|ted
<PB N="238" REF="237">
his po&s;t, he was now condemned on a charge of a&s;&s;ault made upon his gene|ral officer, the Marquis de Montalt, who had brought witne&s;&s;es to prove that his life had been endangered by the circum|&s;tance; and who having pur&s;ued the pro|&s;ecution with the mo&s;t bitter rancour, had at length obtained the &s;entence which the law could not withhold, but which every other officer in the regiment de|plored.</P>
<P>Louis added, that the &s;entence was to be executed in le&s;s than a fortnight, and that Theodore being very unhappy at receiving no an&s;wers to the letters he had &s;ent his father, wi&s;hing to &s;ee him once more, and knowing that there was now no time to be lo&s;t, had reque&s;ted him to go to Leloncourt and acquaint his father with his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>La Luc received the account of his &s;on's condition with a di&s;tre&s;s that admit|ted neither of tears or complaint. He a&s;ked whether Theodore was, and de&s;iring to be conducted to him, he thanked Louis for all his kindne&s;s, and ordered po&s;t hor&s;es immediately.</P>
<P>A carriage was &s;oon ready, and this unhappy father, after taking a mournful leave of M. Verneuil, and &s;ending a compliment to M. Mauron, attended by
<PB N="239" REF="238">
his family, &s;et out for the pri&s;on of his &s;on. The journey was a &s;ilent one; each individual of the party endeavoured, in con&s;ideration of each other, to &s;uppre&s;s the expre&s;&s;ion of grief, but was unable to do more. La Luc appeared calm and complacent; he &s;eemed frequently to be engaged in prayer; but a &s;truggle for re&s;ignation and compo&s;ure was &s;ometimes vi&s;ible upon his countenance, notwith&s;tand|ing the efforts of his mind.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE now return to the Marquis de Montalt, who having &s;een La Motte &s;afely lodged in the pri&s;on of D&mdash;y, and learning the trial would not come on immediately, had returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> his villa on the borders of the fore&s;t, where he expected to hear news of Adeline. It had been his intention to follow his &s;ervants to Lyons; but he now deter|mined to wait a few days for letters, and he had little doubt that Adeline, &s;ince her flight had been &s;o quickly pur|&s;ued, would be overtaken, and probably
<PB N="240" REF="239">
before &s;he could reach that city. In this expectation he had been mi&s;erably di&s;|appointed; for his &s;ervants informed him, that though they traced her thither, they had neither been able to follow her route beyond, nor to di&s;cover her at Lyons. This e&s;cape &s;he probably owed to hav|ing embarked on the Rhone, for it does not appear that the Marquis's people thought of &s;eeking her on the cour&s;e of that river.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ence was &s;oon after required at Vaceau, where the court martial was then &s;itting; thither, therefore, he went, with pa&s;&s;ions &s;till more exa&s;perated by his late di&s;appointment, and procured the condemnation of Theodore. The &s;entence was univer&s;ally lamented, for Theodore was much beloved in his regi|ment; and the occa&s;ion of the Marquis's per&s;onal re&s;entment towards him being known, every heart was intere&s;ted in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Louis de la Motte happening at this time to be &s;tationed in the &s;ame town, heard an imperfect account of his &s;tory, and being convinced that the pri&s;oner was the young chevalier whom he had formerly &s;een with the Marquis at the Abbey, he was induced partly from compa&s;&s;ion, and partly with a hope of hearing of his
<PB N="241" REF="240">
parents, to vi&s;it him. The compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ympathy which Louis expre&s;&s;ed, and the zeal with which he tendered his &s;er|vices, affected Theodore, and excited in him a warm return of friend&s;hip. Louis made him frequent vi&s;its, did every thing that kindne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t to alleviate his &s;ufferings, and a mutual e&s;teem and confi|dence en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Theodore at length communicated the chief &s;ubject of his concern to Louis, who di&s;covered with inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, that it was Adeline whom the Marquis had thus cruelly per&s;ecuted, and Adeline for who&s;e &s;ake the generous Theodore was about to &s;uffer. He &s;oon perceived al&s;o that Theodore was his favoured rival; but he generou&s;|ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the jealous pang this di&s;covery occa&s;ioned, and determined that no pre|judice of pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould withdraw him from the duties of humanity and friend&s;hip. He eagerly inquired where Adeline then re&s;ided. <Q REND="inline">"She is yet, I fear, in the power of the Marquis,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, &s;ighing deeply. <Q REND="inline">"O God!&mdash;the&s;e chains!"&mdash;</Q>and he threw an agonizing glance upon them. Louis &s;at &s;ilent and thoughtful; at length &s;tarting from his reverie, he &s;aid he would go to the Marquis, and immediately quitted the pri&s;on. The Marquis was, however, al|ready &s;et off for Paris, where he had been
<PB N="242" REF="241">
&s;ummoned to appear at the approaching trial of La Motte; and Louis, yet ignorant of the late tran&s;actions at the Abbey, re|turned to the pri&s;on, where he endeavoured to forget that Theodore was the favoured rival of his love, and to remember him only as the defender of Adeline. So ear|ne&s;tly he pre&s;&s;ed his offers of &s;ervice, that Theodore, whom the &s;ilence of his father equally &s;urprized and afflicted, and who was very anxious to &s;ee him once again, accepted his propo&s;al of going him&s;elf to Savoy. <Q REND="inline">"My letters I &s;tongly &s;u&s;pect to have been intercepted by the Marquis,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"if &s;o, my poor father will have the whole weight of this ca|lamity to &s;u&s;tain at once, unle&s;s I avail my&s;elf of your kindne&s;s, and I &s;hall nei|ther &s;ee him nor hear from him before I die. Louis! there are moments when my fortitude &s;hrinks from the conflict, and my &s;en&s;es threaten to de&s;ert me."</Q></P>
<P>No time was to be lo&s;t; the warrant for his execution had already received the king's &s;ignature, and Louis immediately &s;et forward for Savoy. The letters of Theodore had indeed been intercepted by order of the Marquis, who, in the hope of di&s;covering the a&s;ylum of Adeline, had opened and afterwards de&s;troyed them.</P>
<P>But to return to La Luc, who now
<PB N="243" REF="242">
drew near Vaceau, and whom his family ob&s;erved to be greatly changed in his looks &s;ince he had heard the late calamitous in|telligence; he uttered no complaint; but it was too obvious that his di&s;order had made a rapid progre&s;s. Louis, who, during the journey, proved the goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition by the delicate attentions he paid this unhappy party, concealed his ob&s;ervation of the decline of La Luc, and, to &s;upport Adeline's &s;pirits, endeavoured to convince her that her apprehen&s;ions on this &s;ubject were groundle&s;s. Her &s;pirits did indeed require &s;upport, for &s;he was now within a few miles of the town that contain|ed Theodore; and while her increa&s;ing perturbation almo&s;t overcome her, &s;he yet tried to appear compo&s;ed. When the carriage entered the town, &s;he ca&s;t a timid and anxious glance from the window in &s;earch of the pri&s;on; but having pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal &s;treets without perceiving any building which corre&s;ponded with her idea of that &s;he looked for, the coach &s;topped at the inn. The frequent changes in La Luc's countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind, and when he attempted to alight, feeble and ex|hau&s;ted, he was compelled to accept the &s;upport of Louis, to whom he &s;aintly &s;aid, as he pa&s;&s;ed to the parlour, <Q REND="inline">"I am indeed &s;ick at heart, but I tru&s;t the pain
<PB N="244" REF="243">
will not be long."</Q> Louis pre&s;&s;ed his hand without &s;peaking, and ha&s;tened back for Adeline and Clara, who were already in the pa&s;&s;age. La Luc wiped the tears from his eyes, (they were the fir&s;t he had &s;hed) as they entered the room. <Q REND="inline">"I would go immediately to my poor boy,"</Q> &s;aid he to Louis; <Q REND="inline">"yours, Sir, is a mournful office.&mdash;be &s;o good as to conduct me to him."</Q> He ro&s;e to go, but, feeble and overcome with grief, again &s;at down. Adeline and Clara united in entreating that he would compo&s;e him&s;elf, and take &s;ome refre&s;hment, and Louis urging the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing Theodore for the in|terview, prevailed with him to delay it till his &s;on &s;hould be informed of his arrival, and immediately quitted the inn for the pri&s;on of his friend. When he was gone, La Luc, as a duty he owed tho&s;e he loved, tried to take &s;ome &s;upport, but the convul|&s;ions of his throat would not &s;uffer him to &s;wallow the wine that he held to his parch|ed lips, and he was now &s;o much di&s;or|dered, that he de&s;ired to retire to his chamber, where alone, and in prayer, he pa&s;&s;ed the dreadful interval of Louis's ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Clara on the bo&s;om of Adeline, who &s;at in calm but deep di&s;tre&s;s, yielded to the violence of her grief. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall lo&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="244">
my dear father too,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee it; I &s;hall lo&s;e my father and my bro|ther together."</Q> Adeline wept with her friend for &s;ome time in &s;ilence; and then attempted to per&s;uade her that La Luc was not &s;o ill as &s;he apprehended.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not mi&s;lead me with hope,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"he will not &s;urvive the &s;hock of this calamity&mdash;I &s;aw it from the fir&s;t."</Q> Adeline knowing that La Luc's di&s;tre&s;s would be heightened by the ob&s;er|vance of his daughter's, and that indulgence would only encrea&s;e its poignancy, endea|voured to arou&s;e her to an exertion of fortitude by urging the nece&s;&s;ity of com|manding her emotion in the pre&s;ence of her father. <Q REND="inline">"This is po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"however painful may be the ef|fort. You mu&s;t know, my dear, that my grief is not inferior to your own, yet I have hitherto been enabled to &s;upport my &s;ufferings in &s;ilence, for M. La Luc I do, indeed, love and reverence as a parent."</Q></P>
<P>Louis meanwhile reached the pri&s;on of Theodore, who received him with an air of mingled &s;urprize and impatience. <Q REND="inline">"What brings you back &s;o &s;oon,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"have you heard news of my father?"</Q> Louis now gradually unfolded the circum|&s;tances of their meeting, and La Luc's
<PB N="246" REF="245">
arrival at Vaceau. A various emotion agi|tated the countenance of Theodore on re|ceiving this intelligence. <Q REND="inline">"My poor fa|ther!"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"he has then followed his &s;on to this ignominious place! Lit|tle did I think when la&s;t we parted he would meet me in a pri&s;on, under con|demnation!"</Q> This reflection rou&s;ed an impetuo&s;ity of grief which deprived him for &s;ome time of &s;peech. <Q REND="inline">"But where is he?"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, recovering him&s;elf; <Q REND="inline">"now he is come, I &s;hrink from the interview I have &s;o much wi&s;hed for. The &s;ight of his di&s;tre&s;s will be dreadful to me. Louis! when I am gone&mdash;comfort my poor father."</Q> His voice was again in|terrupted by &s;obs; and Louis, who had been fearful of acquainting him at the &s;ame time of the arrival of La Luc, and the di&s;|covery of Adeline, now judged it proper to admini&s;ter the cordial of this latter intel|ligence.</P>
<P>The glooms of a pri&s;on, and of calamity, vani&s;hed for a tran&s;ient moment; tho&s;e who had &s;een Theodore would have believed this to be the in&s;tant which gave him life and liberty. When his fir&s;t emotions &s;ub&s;ided, <Q REND="inline">"I will not repine,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince I know that Adeline is pre&s;erved, and that I &s;hall once more &s;ee my father, I will endeavour to die with re&s;ignation."</Q> He
<PB N="247" REF="246">
enquired if La Luc was there in the pri&s;on; and was told he was at the inn with Clara and Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"Adeline! Is Adeline there too!&mdash;This is beyond my hopes. Yet why do I rejoice? I mu&s;t never &s;ee her more: this is no place for Adeline."</Q> Again he relap&s;ed into an agony of di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;and again repeated a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning Adeline, till he was reminded by Louis that his father was impatient to &s;ee him&mdash;when, &s;hocked that he had &s;o long detained his friend, he entreated him to conduct La Luc to the pri&s;on, and en|deavour to recollect fortitude for the ap|proaching interview.</P>
<P>When Louis returned to the inn La Luc was &s;till in his chamber, and Clara quitting the room to call him, Adeline &s;eized with trembling impatience the opportunity to en|quire more particularly concerning Theo|dore, than &s;he cho&s;e to do in the pre&s;ence of his unhappy &s;i&s;ter. Lewis repre&s;ented him to be much more tranquil than he real|ly was: Adeline was &s;omewhat &s;oothed by the account; and her tears, hitherto re|&s;trained, flowed &s;ilently and fa&s;t, till La Luc appeared. His countenance had re|covered its &s;erenity, but was impre&s;&s;ed with a deep and &s;teady &s;orrow, which excited in the beholder a mingled emotion of pity and reverence. <Q REND="inline">"How is my &s;on? &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid
<PB N="248" REF="247">
he as he entered the room. <Q REND="inline">"We will go to him immediately."</Q></P>
<P>Clara renewed the entreaties that had been already rejected, to accompany her father, who per&s;i&s;ted in a refu&s;al. <Q REND="inline">"To|morrow you &s;hall &s;ee him,"</Q> added he; <Q REND="inline">"but our fir&s;t meeting mu&s;t be alone. Stay with your friend, my dear; &s;he has need of con&s;olation."</Q> When La Luc was gone, Adeline, unable longer to &s;trug|gle again&s;t the force of grief, retired to her chamber and her bed.</P>
<P>La Luc walked &s;ilently towards the pri&s;on, re&s;ting on the arm of Lewis. It was now night: a dim lamp that hung above &s;hewed them the gates, and Louis rung a bell; La Luc, almo&s;t overcome with agitation, lean|ed again&s;t the po&s;tern till the porter appear|ed. He enquired for Theodore, and fol|lowed the man.; but when he reached the &s;econd court yard he &s;eemed ready to faint, and again &s;topped. Louis de&s;ired the porter would fetch &s;ome water; but La Luc, re|covering his voice, &s;aid he &s;hould &s;oon be better, and would not &s;uffer him to go. In a few minutes he was able to follow Louis, who led him through &s;everal dark pa&s;&s;ages, and up a flight of &s;teps to a door, which being unbarred, di&s;clo&s;ed to him the pri&s;on of his &s;on. He was &s;eated at a &s;mall table, on which &s;tood a lamp that
<PB N="249" REF="248">
threw a feeble light acro&s;s the place, &s;ufficient only to &s;hew its de&s;olation and wretchedne&s;s. When he perceived La Luc he &s;prung from his chair, and in the next moment was in his arms. <Q REND="inline">"My father!"</Q> &s;aid he in a tremu|lous voice. <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on!"</Q> exclaimed La Luc; and they were for &s;ome time &s;ilent, and locked in each other's embrace. At length Theodore led him to the only chair the room afforded, and &s;eating him&s;elf with Louis at the foot of the bed, had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the ravages which illne&s;s and ca|lamity had made on the features of his pa|rent. La Luc made &s;everal efforts to &s;peak, but unable to articulate, laid his hand upon his brea&s;t and &s;ighed deeply. Fearful of the con&s;equence of &s;o affecting a &s;cene on his &s;hattered frame, Lewis endeavoured to call off his attention from the immediate object of his di&s;tre&s;s, and interrupted the &s;ilence; but La Luc &s;huddering, and complaining he was very cold, &s;unk back in his chair. His condition rou&s;ed Theodore from the &s;tupor of de&s;pair; and while he flew to &s;up|port his father, Louis ran out for other a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;oon be better, Theo|dore,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, unclo&s;ing his eye, <Q REND="inline">"the faintne&s;s is already going off. I have not been well of late; and this &s;ad meet|ing!"</Q> Unable any longer to command him&s;elf, Theodore wrung his hand, and
<PB N="250" REF="249">
the di&s;tre&s;s which had long &s;truggled for utterance bur&s;t in convul&s;ive &s;obs from his brea&s;t. La Luc gradually revived, and ex|erted him&s;elf to calm the tran&s;ports of his &s;on; but the fortitude of the latter had now entirely for&s;aken him, and he could only utter exclamation and complaint. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! little did I think we &s;hould ever meet un|der circum&s;tances &s;o dreadful as the pre|&s;ent! But I have not de&s;erved them, my father! the motives of my conduct have &s;till been ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is my &s;upreme con&s;olation,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"and ought to &s;upport you in this hour of trial. The Almighty God, who is the judge of hearts, will reward you hereafter. Tru&s;t in him, my &s;on; I look to him with no feeble hope, but with a firm reliance on his ju&s;tice!"</Q> La Luc's voice faultered; he rai&s;ed his eyes to hea|ven with an expre&s;&s;ion of meek devotion, while the tears of humanity fell &s;lowly on his cheek.</P>
<P>Still more affected by his la&s;t words, Theodore turned from him, and paced the room with quick &s;teps: the entrance of Louis was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to La Luc, who, taking a cordial he had brought, was &s;oon &s;ufficiently re&s;tored to di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject mo&s;t intere&s;ting to him. Theo|dore tried to attain a command of his feel|ings,

and &s;ucceeded. He conver&s;ed with tolerable compo&s;ure for above an hour, dur|ing which La Luc endeavoured to elevate, by religious hope, the mind of his &s;on, and to enable him to meet with fortitude the aweful hour that approached. But the ap|pearance of re&s;ignation which Theodore at|tained always vani&s;hed, when he reflected that he was going to leave his father a prey to grief, and his beloved Adeline for ever. When La Luc was about to depart, he again mentioned her. <Q REND="inline">"Afflicting as an inter|view mu&s;t be in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear the thought of quitting the world without &s;eeing her once again; yet I know not how to a&s;k her to encounter, for my &s;ake, the mi|&s;ery of a parting &s;cene. Tell her that my thoughts never, for a moment, leave her; that"&mdash;</Q>La Luc interrupted, and a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;ince he &s;o much wi&s;h|ed it, he &s;hould &s;ee her, though a meeting could &s;erve only to heighten the mutual an|gui&s;h of a final &s;eparation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know it&mdash;I know it too well,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"yet I cannot re&s;olve to &s;ee her no more, and thus &s;pare her the pain this interview mu&s;t inflict. O my father! when I think of tho&s;e whom I mu&s;t &s;oon leave for ever, my heart breaks. But I will indeed try to profit by your

precept and example, and &s;hew that your paternal care has not been in vain. My good Louis, go with my father&mdash;he has need of &s;upport. How much I owe this generous friend,"</Q> added Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"you well know, Sir."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"I do in truth,"</Q> replied La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"and can never repay his kindne&s;s to you. He has contributed to &s;upport us all; but you require comfort more than my&s;elf&mdash;he &s;hall remain with you&mdash;I will go alone."</Q></P>
<P>This Theodore would not &s;uffer; and La Luc no longer oppo&s;ing him, they af|fectionately embraced, and &s;eparated for the night.</P>
<P>When they reached the inn, La Luc con|&s;ulted with Louis on the po&s;&s;ibility of ad|dre&s;&s;ing a petition to the &s;overeign, time enough to &s;ave Theodore. His di&s;tance from Paris, and the &s;hort interval before the period fixed for the execution of the &s;en|tence, made this de&s;ign difficult; but be|lieving it was practicable, La Luc, incapa|ble as he appeared of performing &s;o long a journey, determined to attempt it. Louis, thinking that the undertaking would prove fatal to the father, without benefiting the &s;on, endeavoured, though faintly, to di&s;&s;uade him from it&mdash;but his re&s;olution was fixed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If I &s;acrifice the &s;mall remains of my life in the &s;ervice of my child,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<PB N="253" REF="252">
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall lo&s;e little: if I &s;ave him, I &s;hall gain every thing. There is no time to be lo&s;t&mdash;I will &s;et off immediately."</Q></P>
<P>He would have ordered po&s;t hor&s;es, but Louis, and Clara, who was now come from the bed-&s;ide of her friend, urged the nece&s;&s;ity of his taking a few hours repo&s;e: he was at length compelled to acknowledge him&s;elf unequal to the immediate exertion which the parental anxiety prompted, and con&s;ented to &s;eek re&s;t.</P>
<P>When he had retired to his chamber, Clara lamented the condition of her father.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He will not bear the journey,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"he is greatly changed within the&s;e few days."&mdash;</Q>Louis was &s;o entirely of her opinion, that he could not di&s;gui&s;e it, even to flatter her with a hope. She added, what did not contribute to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, that Adeline was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed by her grief for the &s;ituation of Theodore, and the &s;uf|ferings of La Luc, that &s;he dreaded the con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een that the pa&s;&s;ion of young La Motte had &s;uffered no abatement from time or ab&s;ence; on the contrary, the per|&s;ecution and the dangers which had pur|&s;ued Adeline awakened all his tenderne&s;s, and drew her nearer to his heart. When he had di&s;covered that Theodore loved her, and was beloved again, he experienced all
<PB N="254" REF="253">
the angui&s;h of jealou&s;y and di&s;appointment; for though &s;he had forbade him to hope, he found it too painful an effort to obey her, and had &s;ecretly cheri&s;hed the flame which he ought to have &s;tifled. His heart was however, too noble to &s;uffer his zeal for Theodore to abate becau&s;e he was his fa|voured rival, and his mind too &s;trong not to conceal the angui&s;h this certainty occa|&s;ioned. The attachment which Theodore had te&s;tified towards Adeline even endeared him to Louis, when he had recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock of di&s;appointment, and that conque&s;t over jealou&s;y which originated in principle, and was pur&s;ued with difficulty, became afterwards his pride and his glory. When, however, he again &s;aw Adeline&mdash;&s;aw her in the mild dignity of &s;orrow more intere&s;ting than ever&mdash;&s;aw her, though &s;inking beneath its pre&s;&s;ure, yet tender and &s;olicitous to &s;often the afflictions of tho&s;e around her&mdash;it was with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty he pre&s;erved his re&s;olution, and for|bore to expre&s;s the &s;entiments &s;he in&s;pired. When he farther con&s;idered that her acute &s;ufferings aro&s;e from the &s;trength of her affection, he more than ever wi&s;hed him|&s;elf the object of a heart capable of &s;o tender a regard, and Theodore in pri&s;on and in chains was a momentary object of envy.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="254">
In the morning, when La Luc aro&s;e from &s;hort and di&s;turbed &s;lumbers, he found Louis, Clara, and Adeline, whom indi&s;|po&s;ition could not prevent from paying him this te&s;timony of re&s;pect and affection, a&s;|&s;embled in the parlour of the inn to &s;ee him depart.

<P>WE return now to Pierre De la Motte, who, after remaining &s;ome weeks in the pri&s;on of D&mdash;y, was removed to take his
<PB N="256" REF="255">
trial in the courts of Paris, whither the Marquis de Montalt followed to pro&s;ecute the charge. Madame De la Motte accom|panied her hu&s;band to the pri&s;on of the Cha|telet. His mind &s;unk under the weight of his misfortunes; nor could all the efforts of his wife rou&s;e him from the torpidity of de&s;pair which a con&s;ideration of his circum|&s;tances occa&s;ioned. Should he be even ac|quitted of the charge brought again&s;t him by the Marquis, (which was very unlikely) he was now in the &s;cene of his former crimes, and the moment that &s;hould liberate him from the walls of his pri&s;on would pro|bably deliver him again into the hands of offended ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution of the Marquis was too well founded, and its object of a nature too &s;erious, not to ju&s;tify the terror of La Motte. Soon after the latter had &s;ettled at the Abbey of St. Clair, the &s;mall &s;tock of money which the emergency of his circum|&s;tances had left him being nearly exhau&s;t|ed, his mind became corroded with the mo&s;t cruel anxiety concerning the means of his future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. As he was one evening riding alone in a remote part of the fore&s;t, mu&s;ing on his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tan|ces, and meditating plans to relieve the exi|gencies which he &s;aw approaching, he per|ceived among the trees at &s;ome di&s;tance a
<PB N="257" REF="256">
chevalier on hor&s;eback, who was riding de|liberately along, and &s;eemed wholly unat|tended. A thought darted acro&s;s the mind of La Motte, that he might be &s;pared the evils which threatened him by robbing this &s;tranger. His former practices had pa&s;&s;ed the boundary of hone&s;ty&mdash;fraud was in &s;ome degree familiar to him&mdash;and the thought was not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. He he&s;itated&mdash;every moment of he&s;itation increa&s;ed the power of temptation&mdash;the opportunity was &s;uch as might never occur again. He looked round, and as far as the trees open|ed &s;aw no per&s;on but the chevalier, who &s;eemed by his air to be a man of di&s;tinction. Summoning all his courage, La Motte rode forward and attacked him. The Marquis de Montalt, for it was him, was unarmed, but knowing that his attendants were not far off, he refu&s;ed to yield While they were &s;truggling for victory, La Motte &s;aw &s;everal hor&s;emen enter the extremity of the avenue, and, rendered de&s;perate by oppo|&s;ition and delay, he drew from his pocket a pi&s;tol, (which an apprehen&s;ion of ban|ditti made him u&s;ually carry when he rode to a di&s;tance from the Abbey) and fired at the Marquis, who &s;taggered and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. La Motte had time to tear from his coat a brilliant &s;tar, &s;ome diamond rings from his fingers, and to rifle his poc|kets,
<PB N="258" REF="257">
before his attendants came up. In|&s;tead of pur&s;uing the robber, they all, in their fir&s;t confu&s;ion, flew to a&s;&s;i&s;t their lord, and La Motte e&s;caped.</P>
<P>He &s;topped before he reached the Abbey at a little ruin, the tomb formerly mention|ed, to examine his booty. It con&s;i&s;ted of a pur&s;e containing &s;eventy louis d'ors; of a diamond &s;tar, three rings of great value, and a miniature &s;et with brilliants of the Marquis him&s;elf, which he had intended as a pre&s;ent for his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s. To La Motte, who but a few hours before had &s;een him&s;elf nearly de&s;titute, the view of this trea&s;ure excited an almo&s;t ungovern|able tran&s;port; but it was &s;oon checked when he remembered the means he had employed to obtain it, and that he had paid for the wealth he contemplated the price of blood. Naturally violent in his pa&s;|&s;ions, this reflection &s;unk him from the &s;ummit of exultation to the aby&s;s of de&s;|pondency. He con&s;idered him&s;elf a mur|derer, and &s;tartled as one awakened from a dream, would have given half the world, had it been his, to have been as poor, and comparatively, as guiltle&s;s as a few preced|ing hours had &s;een him. On examining the portrait he di&s;covered the re&s;emblance, and believing that his hand had deprived the original of life, he gazed upon the picture
<PB N="259" REF="258">
with unutterable angui&s;h. To the horrors of remor&s;e &s;ucceeded the perplexities of fear. Apprehen&s;ive of he knew not what, he lingered at the tomb, where he at length depo&s;ited his trea&s;ure, believing that if his offence &s;hould awaken ju&s;tice, the Abbey might be &s;earched, and the&s;e jewels betray him. From Madame La Motte it was ea&s;y to conceal his increa&s;e of wealth; for as he had never made her acquainted with the exact &s;tate of his finances, &s;he had not &s;u&s;pected the extreme poverty which menaced him, and as they continued to live as u&s;ual, &s;he believed that their expen|ces were drawn from the u&s;ual &s;upply. But it was not &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;gui&s;e the work|ings of remor&s;e and horror: his manner became gloomy and re&s;erved, and his fre|quent vi&s;its to the tomb, where he went partly to examine his trea&s;ure, but chief|ly to indulge in the dreadful plea&s;ure of contemplating the picture of the Mar|quis, excited curio&s;ity. In the &s;olitude of the fore&s;t, where no variety of objects occurred to renovate his ideas, the horri|ble one of having committed murder was ever pre&s;ent to him.&mdash;When the Marquis arrived at the Abbey, the a&s;to|ni&s;hment and terror of La Motte, for at fir&s;t he &s;carce knew whether he beheld the &s;hadow or the &s;ub&s;tance of a human
<PB N="260" REF="259">
form, were quickly &s;ucceeded by appre|hen&s;ion of the puni&s;hment due to the crime he had really committed When his di&s;tre&s;s had prevailed on the Marquis to retire, he informed him that he was by birth a chevalier: he then touched upon &s;uch parts of his misfortunes as he thought would excite pity, expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch abhor|rence of his guilt, and voluntarily uttered &s;uch a &s;olemn promi&s;e of returning the jewels he had yet in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for he had ventured to di&s;po&s;e only of a &s;mall part, that the Marquis at length li&s;tened to him with &s;ome degree of com|pa&s;&s;ion. This favourable &s;entiment, &s;econd|ed by a &s;elfi&s;h motive, induced the Marquis to compromi&s;e with La Motte. Of quick and inflammable pa&s;&s;ions, he had ob&s;erved the beauty of Adeline with an eye of no common regard, and he re&s;olved to &s;pare the life of La Motte upon no other condition than the &s;acrifice of this unfortunate girl. La Motte had neither re&s;olution or virtue &s;ufficient to reject the terms&mdash;the jewels were re&s;tored, and he con&s;ented to betray the innocent Adeline. But as he was too well acquainted with her heart to believe that &s;he would ea&s;ily be won to the practice of vice, and as he &s;till felt a degree of pity and tenderne&s;s for her, he endeavoured to prevail on the Marquis to forbear precipi|tate
<PB N="261" REF="260">
mea&s;ures, and to attempt gradually to undermine her principles by &s;educing her affections. He approved and adopted this plan: the failure of his fir&s;t &s;cheme in|duced him to employ the &s;tratagems he after|wards pur&s;ued, and thus to multiply the misfortunes of Adeline.</P>
<P>Such were the circum&s;tances which had brought La Motte to his pre&s;ent deplorable &s;ituation. The day of trial was now come, and he was led from pri&s;on into the court, where the Marquis appeared as his accu&s;er. When the charge was delivered, La Motte, as is u&s;ual, pleaded not guilty, and the Advo|cate Nemours, who had undertaken to plead for him, afterwards endeavoured to make it appear that the accu&s;ation, on the part of the Marquis de Montalt, was fal&s;e and malicious. To this purpo&s;e he men|tioned the circum&s;tance of the latter having attempted to per&s;uade his client to the mur|der of Adeline: he farther urged that the Marquis had lived in habits of intimacy with La Motte for &s;everal months immediately preceding his arre&s;t, and that it was not till he had di&s;appointed the de&s;igns of his ac|cu&s;er, by conveying beyond his reach the unhappy object of his vengeance, that the Marquis had thought proper to charge La Motte with the crime for which he &s;tood in|dicted. Nemours urged the improbability of
<PB N="262" REF="261">
one man's keeping up a friendly intercour&s;e with another from whom he had &s;uffered the double injury of a&s;&s;ault and robbery; yet it was certain that the Marquis had ob&s;erved a frequent intercour&s;e with La Motte for &s;ome months following the time &s;pecified for the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime. If the Marquis intended to pro&s;ecute, why was it not immediately after his di&s;covery of La Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">? and if not then, what had in|fluenced him to pro&s;ecute at &s;o di&s;tant a pe|riod?</P>
<P>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">is nothing was replied on the part of the Marquis; for as his conduct on this point had been &s;ub&s;ervient to his de&s;igns on Adeline, he could not ju&s;tify it but by expo&s;ing &s;chemes which would betray the darkne&s;s of his character, and invalidate his cau&s;e. He, therefore, contented him&s;elf with producing &s;everal of his &s;ervants as witne&s;&s;es of the a&s;&s;ault and robbery, who &s;wore without &s;cruple to the per&s;on of La Motte, though not one of them had &s;een him otherwi&s;e than through the gloom of evening and riding off at full &s;peed. On a cro&s;s examination mo&s;t of them contradicted each other; their evidence was of cour&s;e rejected; but as the Marquis had yet two other witne&s;&s;es to produce, who&s;e arrival at Paris had been hourly expected, the event of the trial was po&s;tponed, and the court adjourned.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="262">
La Motte was re-conducted to his pri&s;on under the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ure of de&s;pondency with which he had quitted it. As he walk|ed through one of the avenues he pa&s;&s;ed a man who &s;tood by to let him proceed, and who regarded him with a fixed and ear|ne&s;t eye. La Motte thought he had &s;een him before; but the imperfect view he caught of his features through the du&s;kine&s;s of the place made him uncertain as to this, and his mind was in too perturbed a &s;tate to &s;uffer him to feel an intere&s;t on the &s;ubject. When he was gone, the &s;tranger inquired of the keeper of the pri&s;on, who La Motte was; on being told, and receiving an&s;wers to &s;ome farther que&s;tions he put, he de&s;ired he might be admitted to &s;peak with him. The re|que&s;t, as the man was only a debtor, was granted; but as the doors were now &s;hut for the night, the interview was deferred till the morrow.</P>
<P>La Motte found Madame in his room, where &s;he had been waiting for &s;ome hours to hear the event of the trial. They now wi&s;hed more earne&s;tly than ever to &s;ee their &s;on; but they were, as he had &s;u&s;|pected, ignorant of his change of quarters, owing to the letters which he had, as u&s;ual, addre&s;&s;ed to them under an a&s;&s;umed name, remaining at the po&s;t-hou&s;e of Auboin. This circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned Madame La
<PB N="264" REF="263">
Motte to addre&s;s her letters to the place of her &s;on's late re&s;idence, and he had thus continued ignorant of his father's misfor|tunes and removal. Madame La Motte, &s;urprized at receiving no an&s;wers to her letters, &s;ent off another, containing an ac|count of the trial as far as it had proceeded, and a reque&s;t that her &s;on would obtain leave of ab&s;ence, and &s;et out for Paris in|&s;tantly. As &s;he was &s;till ignorant of the failure of her letters, and had it been other|wi&s;e, would not have known whither to have &s;ent them, &s;he directed this as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mean while his approaching fate was never ab&s;ent for a moment from the mind of La Motte, which, feeble by nature, and &s;till more enervated by habits of in|dulgence, refu&s;ed to &s;upport him at this dread|ful period.</P>
<P>While the&s;e &s;cenes were pa&s;&s;ing at Paris, La Luc arrived there without any accident after performing a journey, during which he had been &s;upported almo&s;t entirely by the &s;pirit of his re&s;olution. He ha&s;tened to throw him&s;elf at the feet of the &s;overeign, and &s;uch was the exce&s;s of his feeling on pre&s;ent|ing the petition which was to decide the fate of his &s;on, that he could only look &s;ilently up, and then fainted. The king received the paper, and giving orders for the unhappy father to be taken care of, pa&s;&s;ed on. He
<PB N="265" REF="264">
was carried back to his hotel, where he awaited the event of this his final effort.</P>
<P>Adeline, mean while, continued at Va|ceau in a &s;tate of anxiety too powerful for her long agitated frame, and the illne&s;s in con&s;equence of this, confined her almo&s;t wholly to her chamber. Sometimes &s;he ventured to flatter her&s;elf with a hope that the journey of La Luc would be &s;ucce&s;sful: but the&s;e &s;hort and illu&s;ive intervals of com|fort &s;erved only to heighten, by contra&s;t, the de&s;pondency that &s;ucceeded, and in the alternate extremes of feeling &s;he experi|enced a &s;tate more torturing than that pro|duced either by the &s;harp &s;ting of unexpected calamity, or the &s;ullen pain of &s;ettled de&s;|pair.</P>
<P>When &s;he was well enough &s;he came down to the parlour to conver&s;e with Louis, who brought her frequent accounts of Theo|dore, and who pa&s;&s;ed every moment he could &s;natch from the duty of his profe&s;&s;ion in endeavours to &s;upport and con&s;ole his af|flicted friends. Adeline and Theodore, both looked to him for the little comfort allotted them, for he brought them intelligence of each other, and whenever he appeared, a tran&s;ient melancholy kind of plea&s;ure played round their hearts. He could not con|ceal from Theodore Adeline's indi&s;po&s;i|tion, &s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary to account for
<PB N="266" REF="265">
her not indulging the earne&s;t wi&s;h he re|peatedly expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee her again. To Adeline he &s;poke chiefly of the fortitude and re&s;ignation of his friend, not how|ever forgetting to mention the tender af|fection he con&s;tantly expre&s;&s;ed for her. Accu&s;tomed to derive her &s;ole con&s;olation from the pre&s;ence of Louis, and to ob|&s;erve his unwearied friend&s;hip towards him whom &s;he &s;o truly loved, &s;he found her e&s;teem for him ripen into gratitude, and her regard daily increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The fortitude with which he had &s;aid Theodore &s;upported his calamities was &s;omewhat exaggerated. He could not &s;uffi|ciently forget tho&s;e ties which bound him to life to meet his fate with firmne&s;s; but though the paroxy&s;ms of grief were acute and frequent, he &s;ought, and often attained in the pre&s;ence of his friends, a manly compo&s;ure. From the event of his father's journey he hoped little, yet that little was &s;ufficient to keep his mind in the torture of &s;u&s;pence till the i&s;&s;ue &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>On the day preceding that fixed for the execution of the &s;entence La Luc reached Vaceau. Adeline was at her chamber win|dow when the carriage drew up to the inn; &s;he &s;aw him alight, and with feeble &s;teps, &s;upported by Peter, enter the hou&s;e. From the languor of his air &s;he drew no favoura|ble
<PB N="267" REF="266">
omen, and, almo&s;t &s;inking under the violence of her emotion, &s;he went to meet him. Clara was already with her father when Adeline entered the room. She ap|proached him, but, dreading  to receive from his lips a confirmation of the misfor|tune his countenance &s;eemed to indicate, &s;he looked expre&s;&s;ively at him and &s;at down, unable to &s;peak the que&s;tion &s;he would have a&s;ked. He held out his hand to her in &s;i|lence, &s;unk back in his chair, and &s;eemed to be fainting under oppre&s;&s;ion of heart. His manner confirmed all her fears; at this dreadful conviction her &s;en&s;es failed her, and &s;he &s;at motionle&s;s and &s;tupified.</P>
<P>La Luc and Clara were too much oc|cupied by their own di&s;tre&s;s to ob&s;erve her &s;ituation; after &s;ome time &s;he breathed a heavy &s;igh, and bur&s;t into tears. Reliev|ed by weeping, her &s;pirits gradually return|ed, and &s;he at length &s;aid to La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"It is unnece&s;&s;ary, Sir, to a&s;k the &s;ucce&s;s of your journey; yet, when you can bear to mention the &s;ubject I wi&s;h"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>La Luc waved his hand&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I have nothing to tell but what you already gue&s;s too well. My poor Theodore!"&mdash;</Q>His voice was convul&s;ed with &s;orrow, and &s;ome moments of unutter|able angui&s;h followed.</P>
<P>Adeline was the fir&s;t who recovered
<PB N="268" REF="267">
&s;ufficient recollection to notice the extreme languor of La Luc, and attend to his &s;upport. She ordered him refre&s;hments, and entreat|ed he would retire to his bed and &s;uffer her to &s;end for a phy&s;ician; adding, that the fatigue he had &s;uffered made repo&s;e ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. <Q REND="inline">"Would that I could find it, my dear child,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"it is not in this world that I mu&s;t look for it, but in a better, and that better, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall &s;oon attain. But where is our good friend, Louis La Motte? He mu&s;t lead me to my &s;on."&mdash;</Q>Grief again in|terrupted his utterance, and the entrance of Louis was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to them all. Their tears explained the que&s;tion he would have a&s;ked; La Luc immediately inquired for his &s;on, and thanking Louis for all his kindne&s;s to him, de&s;ired to be conducted to the pri&s;on. Louis endeavour|ed to per&s;uade him to defer his vi&s;it till the morning, and Adeline and Clara joined their entreaties with his, but La Luc de|termined to go that night.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"His time is &s;hort,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"a few hours and I &s;hall &s;ee him no more, at lea&s;t in this world: let me not neglect the&s;e precious moments. Adeline! I had promi&s;ed my poor boy that he &s;hould &s;ee you once more; you are not now equal to the meeting. I will try to
<PB N="269" REF="268">
reconcile him to the di&s;appointment; but if I fail, and you are better in the morning, I know you will exert your|&s;elf to &s;u&s;tain the interview."&mdash;</Q>Ade|line looked impatient, and attempted to &s;peak. La Luc ro&s;e to depart, but could only reach the door of the room, where, faint and feeble, he &s;at down in a chair. <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"I find I am not able to go farther to-night. Go to him, La Motte, and tell him I am &s;omewhat di&s;ordered by my journey, but that I will be with him early in the morning. Do not flatter him with a hope; prepare him for the wor&s;t."&mdash;</Q>There was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence; La Luc at length recovering him&s;elf, de&s;ired Clara would order his bed to be got ready, and &s;he willingly obeyed. When he withdrew, Adeline told Louis, what was indeed unne|ce&s;&s;ary, the event of La Luc's journey. <Q REND="inline">"I own,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that I had &s;ometimes &s;uffered my&s;elf to hope, and I now feel this calamity with double force. I fear too that M. La Luc will &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ure; he is much al|tered for the wor&s;e &s;ince he &s;et out for Paris. Tell me your opinion &s;incere|ly."</Q></P>
<P>The change was &s;o obvious, that Louis could not deny it, but he endeavoured
<PB N="270" REF="269">
to &s;ooth her apprehen&s;ion by a&s;cribing this alteration, in a great mea&s;ure, to the temporary fatigue of travelling. Ade|line declared her re&s;olution of accom|panying La Luc to take leave of Theo|dore in the morning. <Q REND="inline">"I know not how I &s;hall &s;upport the interview,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"but to &s;ee him once more is a duty I owe both to him and my&s;elf. The re|membrance of having neglected to give him this la&s;t proof of affection would pur|&s;ue me with ince&s;&s;ant remor&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome farther conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject Louis withdrew to the pri&s;on, ruminating on the be&s;t means of impart|ing to his friend the fatal intelligence he had to communicate. Theodore received it with more compo&s;ure than he had expect|ed; but he a&s;ked, with impatience, why he did not &s;ee his father and Adeline, and on being informed that indi&s;po&s;ition with|held them, his imagination &s;eized on the wor&s;t po&s;&s;ibility, and &s;ugge&s;ted that his fa|ther was dead. It was a con&s;iderable time before Louis could convince him of the con|trary, and that Adeline was not dangerou&s;ly ill; when, however, he was a&s;&s;ured that he &s;hould &s;ee them in the morning, he be|came more tranquil. He de&s;ired his friend would not leave him that night. <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are the la&s;t hours we can pa&s;s together,"</Q>
<PB N="271" REF="270">
added he; <Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;leep! Stay with me and lighten their heavy moments. I have need of comfort, Louis. Young as I am, and held by &s;uch &s;trong attach|ments, I cannot quit the world with re|&s;ignation. I know not how to credit tho&s;e &s;tories we hear of philo&s;ophic fortitude; wi&s;dom cannot teach us cheerfully to re|&s;ign a good, and life in my circum&s;tances is &s;urely &s;uch."</Q></P>
<P>The night was pa&s;&s;ed in embarra&s;&s;ed conver&s;ation; &s;ometimes interrupted by long fits of &s;ilence, and &s;ometimes by the paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair; and the morning of that day which was to lead Theodore to death at length dawned through the grates of his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>La Luc mean while pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s and dreadful night. He prayed for for|titude and re&s;ignation both for him&s;elf and Theodore; but the pangs of nature were powerful in his heart, and not to be &s;ubdued. The idea of his lamented wife, and of what &s;he would have &s;uffer|ed had &s;he lived to witne&s;s the ignominious death which awaited her &s;on, frequently oc|curred to him.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as if a de&s;tiny had hung over the life of Theodore, for it is probable that the king might have granted the petition of the unhappy father, had it not happened
<PB N="272" REF="271">
that the Marquis de Montalt was pre&s;ent at court when the paper was pre&s;ented. The appearance and &s;ingular di&s;tre&s;s of the peti|tioner had intere&s;ted the monarch, and, in|&s;tead of putting by the paper, he opened it. As he threw his eyes over it, ob&s;erving that the criminal was of the Marquis de Montalt's regiment: he turned to him and inquired the nature of the offence for which the culprit was about to &s;uffer. The an&s;wer was &s;uch as might have been expected from the Marquis, and the king was convinced that Theodore was not a proper object of mercy.</P>
<P>But to return to La Luc, who was call|ed, according to his order, at a very early hour. Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in prayer, he went down to the parlour, where Louis, punctual to the moment, already waited to conduct him to the pri&s;on. He appeared calm and collected, but his countenance was impre&s;&s;ed with a fixed de&s;pair that &s;en&s;ibly affected his young friend. While they wait|ed for Adeline he &s;poke little, and &s;eemed &s;truggling to attain the fortitude nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport him through the approaching &s;cene. Adeline not appearing, he at length &s;ent to ha&s;ten her, and was told &s;he had been ill, but was recovering. She had indeed pa&s;&s;ed a night of &s;uch agitation, that her frame had &s;unk under it, and &s;he was now endea|vouring to recover &s;trength and compo&s;ure
<PB N="273" REF="272">
&s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain her in this dreadful hour. Every moment that brought her nearer to it had increa&s;ed her emotion, and the ap|prehen&s;ion of being prevented &s;eeing Theo|dore had alone enabled her to &s;truggle again&s;t the united pre&s;&s;ure of illne&s;s and grief.</P>
<P>She now, with Clara, joined La Luc, who advanced as they entered the room, and took a hand of each in &s;ilence. After &s;ome moments he propo&s;ed to go, and they &s;tep|ped into a carriage which conveyed them to the gates of the pri&s;on. The crowd had al|ready began to a&s;&s;emble there, and a confu&s;|ed murmur aro&s;e as the carriage moved for|ward; it was a grievous &s;ight to the friends of Theodore. Louis &s;upported Adeline when &s;he alighted, &s;he was &s;carcely able to walk, and with trembling &s;teps &s;he followed La Luc, whom the keeper led towards that part of the pri&s;on where his &s;on was confined. It was now eight o'clock, the &s;entence was not to be executed till twelve but a guard of &s;oldiers was already placed in the court, and as this unhappy party pa&s;&s;ed along the narrow avenues they were met by &s;everal of|ficers who had been to take a la&s;t farewell of Theodore. As they a&s;cended the &s;tairs that led to his apartment, La Luc's ear caught the clink of chains, and heard him walking above with a quick irregular &s;tep. The unhappy father, overcome by the mo|ment
<PB N="274" REF="273">
which now pre&s;&s;ed upon him, &s;topped, and was obliged to &s;upport him&s;elf by the banni&s;ter. Louis fearing the con&s;equence of his grief might be fatal, &s;hattered as his frame already was, would have gone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but he made a &s;ign to him to &s;tay. <Q REND="inline">"I am better;"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"O God! &s;upport me through this hour!"</Q> and in a few minutes he was able to proceed.</P>
<P>As the warder unlocked the door, the har&s;h grating of the key &s;hocked Adeline, but in the next moment &s;he was in the pre|&s;ence of Theodore, who &s;prung to meet her, and caught her in his arms before &s;he &s;unk to the ground. As her head reclined on his &s;houlder, he again viewed that coun|tenance &s;o dear to him, which had &s;o often lighted rapture in his heart, and which though pale and inanimate as it now was, awakened him to momentary delight. When at length &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, &s;he fixed them in long and mournful gaze upon Theo|dore, who pre&s;&s;ing her to his heart could an&s;wer her only with a &s;mile of mingled ten|derne&s;s and de&s;pair; the tears he endea|voured to re&s;train trembled in his eyes, and he forgot for a time every thing but Adeline. La Luc, who had &s;eated him&s;elf at the foot of the bed, &s;eemed uncon&s;cious of what pa&s;&s;|ed around him, and entirely ab&s;orbed in his own grief; but Clara, as &s;he cla&s;ped the
<PB N="275" REF="274">
hand of her brother, and hung weeping on his arm, expre&s;&s;ed aloud all the angui&s;h of her heart, and at length recalled the atten|tion of Adeline, who in a voice &s;carcely au|dible entreated &s;he would &s;pare her father. Her words rou&s;ed Theodore, and &s;upport|ing Adeline to a chair, he turned to La Luc. <Q REND="inline">"My dear child!"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, gra&s;ping his hand and bur&s;ting into tears, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child!"</Q> They wept together. After a long interval of &s;ilence, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I thought I could have &s;upported this hour, but I am old and feeble. God knows my ef|forts for re&s;ignation, my faith in his good|ne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P>Theodore by a &s;trong and &s;udden exerti|on a&s;&s;umed a compo&s;ed and firm counte|nance, and endeavoured by every gentle argument to &s;ooth and comfort his weeping friends. La Luc at length &s;eemed to con|quer his &s;ufferings; drying his eyes, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, I ought to have &s;et you a bet|ter example, and practi&s;ed the precepts of fortitude I have &s;o often given you. But it is over; I know, and will per|form, my duty."</Q> Adeline breathed a hea|vy &s;igh, and continued to weep. <Q REND="inline">"Be com|forted, my love, we part but for a time,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore as he ki&s;&s;ed the tears from her cheek; and uniting her hand with that of his father's, he earne&s;tly recommended her
<PB N="276" REF="275">
to his protection. <Q REND="inline">"Receive her,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"as the mo&s;t precious legacy I can bequeath; con&s;ider her as your child. She will con&s;ole you when I am gone, &s;he will more than &s;upply the lo&s;s of your &s;on."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc a&s;&s;ured him that he did now, and &s;hould continue to, regard Adeline as his daughter. During tho&s;e afflicting hours he endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate the terrors of approaching death by in&s;piring his &s;on with religious confidence. His conver|&s;ation was pious, rational and con&s;olatory: he &s;poke not from the cold dictates of the head, but from the feelings of a heart which had long loved and practi&s;ed the pure precepts of chri&s;tianity, and which now drew from them a comfort &s;uch as no|thing earthly could be&s;tow.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are young, my &s;on,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and are yet innocent of any great crime; you may therefore look on death with|out terror, for to the guilty only is his approach dreadful. I feel that I &s;hall not long &s;urvive you, and I tru&s;t in a merci|ful God that we &s;hall meet in a &s;tate where &s;orrow never comes; <HI>where the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall come with heal|ing in his wing!</HI>"</Q> As he &s;poke he looked up; the tears &s;till trembled in his eyes, which beamed with meek yet &s;ervent devo|tion,
<PB N="277" REF="276">
and his countenance glowed with the dignity of a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let us not neglect the awful mo|ments,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"let our united prayers a&s;cend to Him who alone can comfort and &s;upport us!"</Q> They all knelt down, and he prayed with that &s;im|ple and &s;ublime eloquence which true piety in&s;pires. When he ro&s;e he embraced his children &s;eparately, and when he came to Theodore he pau&s;ed, gazed upon him with an earne&s;t, mournful expre&s;&s;ion, and was for &s;ome time unable to &s;peak. Theodore could not bear this; he drew his hand before his eyes, and vainly endeavoured to &s;tifle the deep &s;obs which convul&s;ed his frame. At length recovering his voice, he entreated his father would leave him. <Q REND="inline">"This mi&s;e|ry is too much for us all,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"let us not prolong it. The time is now draw|ing on&mdash;leave me to compo&s;e my&s;elf. The &s;harpne&s;s of death con&s;i&s;ts in part|ing with tho&s;e who are dear to us; when that is pa&s;&s;ed, death is di&s;armed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not leave you, my &s;on,"</Q> replied La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"My poor girls &s;hall go, but for me, I will be with you in your la&s;t mo|ments."</Q> Theodore felt that this would be too much for them both, and urged eve|ry argument which rea&s;on could &s;ugge&s;t to prevail with his father to relinqui&s;h his de|&s;ign.
<PB N="278" REF="277">
But he remained firm in his deter|mination. <Q REND="inline">"I will not &s;uffer a &s;elfi&s;h con|&s;ideration of the pain I may endure,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"to tempt me to de&s;ert my child when he will mo&s;t require my &s;up|port. It is my duty to attend you, and nothing &s;hall withhold me."</Q></P>
<P>Theodore &s;eized on the words of La Luc&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As you would that I &s;hould be &s;upported in my la&s;t hour,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I en|treat that you will not be witne&s;s of it. Your pre&s;ence, my dear father, would &s;ubdue all my fortitude&mdash;would de&s;troy what little compo&s;ure I may otherwi&s;e be able to attain. Add not to my &s;ufferings the view of your di&s;tre&s;s, but leave me to forget, if po&s;&s;ible, the dear parent I mu&s;t quit for ever."</Q> His tears flowed anew. La Luc continued to gaze on him in &s;ilent agony; at length he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, be it &s;o. If indeed my pre&s;ence would di&s;tre&s;s you, I will not go."</Q> His voice was broken and interrupted. After a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments he again embraced Theo|dore&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t part,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> part, but it is only for a time&mdash;we &s;hall &s;oon be re-united in a higher world!&mdash;O God! thou &s;ee&s;t my heart&mdash;thou &s;ee&s;t all its feelings in this bit|ter hour!"&mdash;</Q>Grief again overcame him. He pre&s;&s;ed Theodore in his arms; and at
<PB N="279" REF="278">
length, &s;eeming to &s;ummon all his fortitude, he again &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We <HI>mu&s;t</HI> part&mdash;Oh! my &s;on, farewell for ever in this world!&mdash;The mercy of Almighty God &s;upport and ble&s;s you!"</Q></P>
<P>He turned away to leave the pri&s;on, but, quite worn out with grief, &s;unk into a chair near the door he would have opened. The|odore gazed, with a di&s;tracted counte|nance, alternately on his father, on Clara, and on Adeline, whom he pre&s;&s;ed to his throbbing heart, and their tears flowed to|gether. <Q REND="inline">"And do I then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"for the la&s;t time look upon that countenance!&mdash;Shall I never&mdash;never more behold it?&mdash;O! exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery! Yet once again&mdash;once more,"</Q> continued he, pre&s;&s;|ing her cheek, but it was in&s;en&s;ible and cold as marble.</P>
<P>Louis, who had left the room &s;oon after La Luc arrived, that his pre&s;ence might not interrupt their farewell grief, now returned. Adeline rai&s;ed her head, and perceiving who entered, it again &s;unk on the bo&s;om of Theodore.</P>
<P>Louis appeared much agitated. La Luc aro&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t go,"</Q> &s;aid he: <Q REND="inline">"Adeline, my love, exert your&s;elf&mdash;Clara&mdash;my children, let us depart.&mdash;Yet one la&s;t&mdash;la&s;t embrace, and then!"&mdash;</Q>Louis advanced and took his hand; <Q REND="inline">"My
<PB N="280" REF="279">
dear Sir, I have &s;omething to &s;ay; yet I fear to tell it."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean?"</Q> &s;aid La Luc, with quickne&s;s: <Q REND="inline">"No new misfortune can have power to afflict me at this moment. Do not fear to &s;peak."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"I rejoice that I cannot put you to the proof,"</Q> replied Louis; <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een you &s;u&s;tain the mo&s;t trying affliction with fortitude. Can you &s;up|port the tran&s;ports of hope?"&mdash;</Q>La Luc gazed eagerly on Louis&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Speak!"</Q> &s;aid he, in a faint voice. Adeline rai&s;ed her head, and, trembling between hope and fear, looked at Louis as if &s;he would have &s;earch|ed his &s;oul. He &s;miled cheerfully upon her. <Q REND="inline">"Is it&mdash;O! is it po&s;&s;ible!"</Q> &s;he exclaim|ed, &s;uddenly re-animated&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He lives! He lives!"&mdash;</Q>She &s;aid no more, but ran to La Luc, who &s;unk &s;ainting in his chair, while Theodore and Clara with one voice called on Louis to relieve them from the tortures of &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>He proceeded to inform them that he had obtained from the commanding officer a re&s;|pite for Theodore till the king's farther plea&s;ure could be known, and this in con|&s;equence of a letter received that morning from his mother, Madame De la Motte, in which &s;he mentioned &s;ome very extraor|dinary circum&s;tances that had appeared in the cour&s;e of a trial lately conducted at Paris,
<PB N="281" REF="280">
and which &s;o materially affected the cha|racter of the Marquis de Montalt as to render it po&s;&s;ible a pardon might be obtained for Theodore.</P>
<P>The&s;e words darted with the rapidity of lightning upon the hearts of his hearers. La Luc revived, and that pri&s;on &s;o lately the &s;cene of de2&s;pair now echoed only to the voices of gratitude and gladne&s;s. La Luc, rai&s;ing his cla&s;ped hands to Heaven, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Great God! &s;upport me in this mo|ment, as thou ha&s;t already &s;upported me!&mdash;If my &s;on lives, I die in peace."</Q></P>
<P>He embraced Theodore, and remem|bering the angui&s;h of his la&s;t embrace, tears of thankfulne&s;s and joy flowed to the con|tra&s;t. So powerful indeed was the effect of this temporary reprieve, and of the hope it introduced, that if an ab&s;olute pardon had been obtained, it could &s;carcely for the moment have diffu&s;ed a more lively joy. But when the fir&s;t emotions were &s;ub&s;ided, the uncertainty of Theodore's fate once more appeared. Adeline forbore to expre&s;s this, but Clara without &s;cruple lamented the po&s;&s;ibility that her brother might yet be taken from them, and all their joy be turn|ed to &s;orrow. A look from Adeline checked her. Joy was, however, &s;o much the pre|dominant feeling of the pre&s;ent moment, that the &s;hade which reflection threw upon
<PB N="282" REF="281">
their hopes pa&s;&s;ed away like the cloud that is di&s;pelled by the &s;trength of the &s;un beam; and Louis alone was pen&s;ive and ab&s;tract|ed.</P>
<P>When they were &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed, he informed them that the contents of Ma|dame De la Motte's letter obliged him to &s;et out for Paris immediately; and that the intelligence he had to communicate inti|mately concerned Adeline, who would un|doubtedly judge it nece&s;&s;ary to go thither al&s;o as &s;oon as her health would permit. He then read to his impatient auditors &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in the letter as were nece&s;&s;ary to explain his meaning; but as Madame De la Motte had omitted to mention &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances of importance to be under&s;tood, the following is a relation of the occurrences that had lately happened at Paris.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that on the fir&s;t day of his trial, La Motte, in pa&s;&s;ing from the courts to his pri&s;on, &s;aw a per&s;on who&s;e features, though imperfectly &s;een through the du&s;k, he thought he recollected; and that this &s;ame per&s;on, after inquiring the name of La Motte, de&s;ired to be admitted to him. On the following day the warder complied with his reque&s;t, and the &s;urpri&s;e of La Motte may be imagined when, in the &s;tronger light of his apartment, he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the countenance of the man from
<PB N="283" REF="282">
who&s;e hands he had formerly received Ade|line.</P>
<P>On ob&s;erving Madame De la Motte in the room, he &s;aid, he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to impart, and de&s;ired to be left alone with the pri&s;oner. When &s;he was gone, he told De la Motte that he under|&s;tood he was confined at the &s;uit of the Marquis de Montalt. La Motte a&s;&s;ented.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I know him for a villain,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger boldly.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Your ca&s;e is de&s;pe|rate. Do you wi&s;h for life?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Need the que&s;tion be a&s;ked!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your trial, I under&s;tand, proceeds to|morrow. I am now under confinement in this place for debt; but if you can obtain leave for me to go with you into the courts, and a condition from the judge that what I reveal &s;hall not crimi|nate my&s;elf, I will make di&s;coveries that &s;hall confound that &s;ame Marquis; I will prove him a villain; and it &s;hall then be judged how far his word ought to be taken again&s;t you."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte, who&s;e intere&s;t was now &s;trong|ly excited, de&s;ired he would explain him|&s;elf; and the man proceeded to relate a long hi&s;tory of the misfortunes and con&s;e|quent poverty which had tempted him to become &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;chemes of the Marquis, till he &s;uddenly checked him&s;elf,
<PB N="284" REF="283">
and &s;aid. <Q REND="inline">"When I obtain from the court the promi&s;e I require, I will explain my|&s;elf fully; till then I cannot &s;ay more on the &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing a doubt of his &s;incerity, and a curio&s;ity con|cerning the motive that had induced him to become the Marquis's accu&s;er.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As to my motive, it is a very natural one,"</Q> replied the man: <Q REND="inline">"it is no ea&s;y matter to receive ill u&s;age without re&s;enting it, par|ticularly from a villain whom you have &s;erved."&mdash;</Q>La Motte, for his own &s;ake, en|deavoured to check the vehemence with which this was uttered. <Q REND="inline">"I care not who hears me,"</Q> continued the &s;tranger, but at the &s;ame time he lowered his voice; <Q REND="inline">"I repeat it&mdash;the Marquis has u&s;ed me ill&mdash;I have kept his &s;ecret long enough. He does not think it worth while to &s;ecure my &s;ilence, or he would relieve my nece&s;&s;ities. I am in pri&s;on for debt, and have applied to him for relief: &s;ince he does not chu&s;e to give it, let him take the con&s;equence. I warrant he &s;hall &s;oon repent that he has provoked me, and 'tis fit he &s;hould."</Q></P>
<P>The doubts of La Motte were now di&s;|&s;ipated; the pro&s;pect of life again opened upon him, and he a&s;&s;ured Du Bo&s;&s;e, (which was the &s;tranger's name) with much warmth, that he would commi&s;&s;ion his Advocate to
<PB N="285" REF="284">
do all in his power to obtain leave for his appearance on the trial, and to procure the nece&s;&s;ary condition. After &s;ome farther conver&s;ation they parted.</P>

<P>LEAVE was at length granted for the appearance of Du Bo&s;&s;e, with a promi&s;e that his words &s;hould not criminate him, and he accompanied La Motte into court.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of the Marquis de Mon|talt on perceiving this man was ob&s;erv|ed by many per&s;ons pre&s;ent, and particu|larly by La Motte, who drew from this circum&s;tance a favourable pre&s;age for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>When Du Bo&s;&s;e was called upon, he in|formed the court, that on the night of the twenty-fir&s;t of April in the preced|ing year, one Jean d'Aunoy, a man he had known many years, came to his lodging. After they had di&s;cour&s;ed for &s;ome time on their circum&s;tances, d'Au|noy
<PB N="286" REF="285">
&s;aid he knew a way by which du Bo&s;&s;e might change all his poverty to riches, but that he would not &s;ay more till he was certain he would be willing to follow it. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate in which du Bo&s;&s;e then was made him anxious to learn the means which would bring him relief; he eagerly inquired what his friend meant, and after &s;ome time d'Aunoy explained him&s;elf. He &s;aid he was em|ployed by a nobleman, (who he after|wards told du Bo&s;&s;e was the Marquis de Montalt) to carry off a young gir from a convent, and that &s;he was to be taken to a hou&s;e at a few leagues di&s;tant from Paris. <Q REND="inline">"I knew the hou&s;e he de&s;cribed well,"</Q> &s;aid du Bo&s;&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"for I had been there many times with d'Aunoy, who lived there to avoid his creditors, though he often pa&s;&s;ed his nights at Paris."</Q> He would not tell me more of the &s;cheme, but &s;aid he &s;hould want a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and if I and my brother, who is &s;ince dead, would join him, his em|ployer would grudge no money, and we &s;hould be well rewarded. I de&s;ired him again to tell me more of the plan, but he was ob&s;tinate, and after I had told him I would con&s;ider of what he &s;aid, and &s;peak to my brother, he went away.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286">
<Q REND="inline">"When he called the next night for his an&s;wer, my brother and I agreed to engage, and accordingly we went home with him. He then told us that the young lady he was to bring thither was a natural daughter of the Marquis de Montalt, and of a nun belonging to a convent of Ur&s;alines; that his wi&s;e had received the child immedi|ately on its birth, and had been al|lowed a hand&s;ome annuity to bring it up as her own, which &s;he had done till her death. The child was then placed in a convent and de&s;igned for the veil; but when &s;he was of an age to receive the vows, &s;he had &s;teadily per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing them. This cir|cum&s;tance had &s;o much exa&s;perated the Marquis, that in his rage he or|dered, that if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her ob|&s;tinacy &s;he &s;hould be removed from the convent, and got rid of any way, &s;ince if &s;he lived in the world her birth might be di&s;covered, and in con&s;equence of this, her mother, for whom he had yet a regard, would be condemned to expiate her crime by a terrible death."</Q></P>
<P>Du Bo&s;&s;e was interrupted in his narrative by the council of the Marquis, who contended that the circum&s;tances alledg|ed
<PB N="288" REF="287">
tending to criminate his client, the proceeding was both irrelevant and illegal. He was an&s;wered that it was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">elevant, and therefore not illegal, for that the cir|cum&s;tances which threw light upon the character of the Marquis, affected his evidence again&s;t La Motte. Du Bo&s;&s;e was &s;uffered to proceed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"D'AUnoy then &s;aid that the Marquis had ordered him to di&s;patch her, but that as he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee her from her infancy, he could not find in his heart to do it, and wrote to tell him &s;o. The Marquis then com|manded him to find tho&s;e who would, and this was the bu&s;ine&s;s for which he wanted us. My brother and I were not &s;o wicked as this came to, and &s;o we told d'Aunoy, and I could not help a&s;king why the Marquis re&s;olved to murder his own child rather than expo&s;e her mother to the ri&s;que of &s;uffering death. He &s;aid the Marquis had never &s;een his child, and that therefore it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed he felt much kindne&s;s towards it, and &s;till le&s;s that he could love it better than he loved its mother."</Q></P>
<P>Du Bo&s;&s;e proceeded to relate how much he and his brother had endeavoured to &s;often the heart of d'Aunoy towards the
<PB N="289" REF="288">
Marquis's daughter, and that they pre|vailed with him to write again and plead for her. D'Aunoy went to Paris to await the an&s;wer, leaving them and the young girl at the hou&s;e on the heath, where the former had con&s;ented to re|main, &s;eemingly for the purpo&s;e of exe|cuting the orders they might receive, but really with a de&s;ign to &s;ave the unhappy victim from the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>It is probable that Du Bo&s;&s;e, in this in&s;tance, gave a fal&s;e account of his mo|tive, &s;ince if he was really guilty of an in|tention &s;o atrocious as that of murder, he would naturally endeavour to conceal it. However this might be, he affirmed that on the night of the twenty-&s;ixth of April, he received an order from d'Aunoy for the de&s;truction of the girl whom he had afterwards delivered into the hands of La Motte.</P>
<P>La Motte li&s;tened to this relation in a&s;toni&s;hment; when he knew that Adeline was the daughter of the Marquis, and remembered the crime to which he had once devoted her, his frame thrilled with horror. He now took up the &s;tory, and added an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the Abbey between the Marquis and him&s;elf concerning a de&s;ign of the for|mer upon the life of Adeline; and urged,
<PB N="290" REF="289">
as a proof of the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution ori|ginating in malice, that it had com|menced immediately after he had effect|ed her e&s;cape from the Marquis. He concluded, however, with &s;aying, that as the Marquis had immediately &s;ent his people in pur&s;uit of her, it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might yet have fallen a victim to his vengeance.</P>
<P>Here the Marquis's council again in|terfered, and their objections were again overruled by the court. The uncommon degree of emotion which his countenance betrayed during the narrations of Du Bo&s;&s;e, and De la Motte, was generally ob&s;erved. The court &s;u&s;pended the &s;en|tence of the latter, ordered that the Marquis &s;hould be put under immediate arre&s;t, and that Adeline (the name given by her fo&s;ter mother), and Jean d'Aunoy &s;hould be &s;ought for.</P>
<P>The Marquis was accordingly &s;eized at the &s;uit of the crown, and put under confinement till Adeline &s;hould appear, or proof could be obtained that &s;he died by his order, and till d'Aunoy &s;hould confirm or de&s;troy the evidence of De la Motte.</P>
<P>Madame, who at length obtained in|telligence of her &s;on's re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">dence from the town where he was formerly &s;tationed, had
<PB N="291" REF="290">
acquainted him with his father's &s;ituation, and the proceedings of the trial; and as &s;he believed that Adeline, if &s;he had been &s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape the Mar|quis's pur&s;uit, was &s;till in Savoy, &s;he de|&s;ired Louis would obtain leave of ab&s;ence, and bring her to Paris, where her imme|diate pre&s;ence was requi&s;ite to &s;ub&s;tan|tiate the evidence, and probably to &s;ave the life of La Motte.</P>
<P>On the receipt of her letter, which happened on the morning appointed for the execution of Theodore, Louis went immediately to the commanding officer to petition for a re&s;pite till the king's fur|ther plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. He founded his plea on the arre&s;t of the Marquis, and &s;hewed the letter he had ju&s;t received. The commanding officer readily granted a reprieve, and Louis, who, on the arrival of this letter, had forborne to communicate its contents to Theodore, le&s;t it &s;hould torture him with fal&s;e hope, now ha&s;tened to him with this comfortable news.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON learning the purpo&s;e of Madame de la Motte's letter, Adeline &s;aw the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of her immediate departure for Paris. The life of La Motte, who had more than &s;aved her's, the life, perhaps, of her beloved Theodore, depended on the te&s;timony &s;he &s;hould give. And &s;he who had &s;o lately been &s;inking under the influence of illne&s;s and de&s;pair, who could &s;carcely rai&s;e her languid head, or &s;peak but in the fainte&s;t accents, now re|animated with hope, and invigorated by a &s;en&s;e of the importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s before her, prepared to perform a rapid journey of &s;ome hundred miles.</P>
<P>Theodore tenderly intreated that &s;he would &s;o far con&s;ider her health as to delay this journey for a few days; but with a &s;mile of enchanting tenderne&s;s &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he was now too happy to be ill, and that the &s;ame cau&s;e which would confirm her happine&s;s would con|firm her health. So &s;trong was the effect of hope upon her mind now, that it &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="293" REF="292">
to the mi&s;ery of de&s;pair, that it overcame the &s;hock &s;he &s;uffered on be|lieving her&s;elf a daughter of the Mar|quis, and every other painful reflection. She did not even fore&s;ee the ob&s;tacle that circum&s;tance might produce to her union with Theodore, &s;hould he at la&s;t be permitted to live.</P>
<P>It was &s;ettled that &s;he &s;hould &s;et off for Paris in a few hours with Louis, and at|tended by Peter. The&s;e hours were pa&s;&s;ed by La Luc and his family in the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>When the time of her departure arrived, the &s;pirits of Adeline again for&s;ook her, and the illu&s;ions of joy di&s;appeared. She no longer beheld Theodore as one re&s;pited from death, but took leave of him with a mournful pre-&s;entiment that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him no more. So &s;trongly was this pre&s;age impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind, that it was long before &s;he could &s;ummon re&s;olution to bid him farewell; and when &s;he had done &s;o, and even left the apartment, &s;he returned to take of him a la&s;t look. As &s;he was once more quitting the room, her melancholy imagination repre&s;ented Theodore at the place of execution, pale and convul&s;ed in death; &s;he again turned her lingering eyes upon him; but fancy affected her &s;en&s;e, for &s;he thought as &s;he now gazed
<PB N="294" REF="293">
that his countenance changed, and a&s;&s;umed a gha&s;tly hue. All her re&s;olution vani&s;hed and &s;uch was the angui&s;h of her heart, that &s;he re&s;olved to defer her journey till the morrow, though &s;he mu&s;t by this means lo&s;e the pro|tection of Louis, who&s;e impatience to meet his father would not fuffer the delay. The triumph of pa&s;&s;ion, however, was tran&s;ient; &s;oothed by the indulgence &s;he promi&s;ed her|&s;elf, her grief &s;ub&s;ided, rea&s;on re&s;umed its influence; &s;he again &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of her immediate departure, and recollected &s;ufficient re&s;olution to &s;ubmit. La Luc would have accompanied her for the pur|po&s;e of again &s;oliciting the King in behalf of his &s;on, had not the extreme weakne&s;s and la&s;&s;itude to which he was reduced made travelling impracticable.</P>
<P>At length, Adeline, with a heavy heart quitted Theodore, notwith&s;tanding his en|treaties, that &s;he would not undertake the journey in her pre&s;ent weak &s;tate, and was accompanied by Clara and La Luc to the inn. The former parted from her friend with many tears, and much anxiety for her welfare, but under a hope of &s;oon meeting again. Should a pardon be granted to Theodore, La Luc de&s;igned to fetch Adeline from Paris; but &s;hould this be refu&s;ed, &s;he was to return with Peter. He bade her adieu with a father's kindne&s;s, which &s;he
<PB N="295" REF="294">
repaid with a filial affection, and in her la&s;t words conjured him to attend to the recovery of his health: the languid &s;mile he a&s;&s;umed &s;eemed to expre&s;s that her &s;olicitude was vain, and that he thought his health pa&s;t recovery.</P>
<P>Thus Adeline quitted the friends &s;o ju&s;tly dear to her, and &s;o lately found, for Paris, where &s;he was a &s;tranger, almo&s;t without protection, and compelled to meet a father who had pur&s;ued her with the utmo&s;t cruel|ty, in a public court of ju&s;tice. The car|riage in leaving Vaceau pa&s;&s;ed by the pri&s;on; &s;he threw an eager look towards it as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; its heavy black walls, and narrow-grated windows, &s;eemed to frown upon her hopes&mdash;but Theodore was there, and leaning from the window, &s;he con|tinued to gaze upon it till an abrupt turning in the &s;treet concealed it from her view. She then &s;unk back in the carriage, and yielding to the melancholy of her heart, wept in &s;ilence. Louis was not di&s;po&s;ed to interrupt it; his thoughts were anxi|ou&s;ly employed on his father's &s;ituation, and the travellers proceeded many miles without exchanging a word.</P>
<P>At Paris, whither we &s;hall now return, the &s;earch after Jean d'Aunoy was pro|&s;ecuted without &s;ucce&s;s. The hou&s;e on the heath, de&s;cribed by du Bo&s;&s;e, was
<PB N="296" REF="295">
found uninhabited, and to the places of his u&s;ual re&s;ort in the city, where the officers of the police awaited him, he no longer came. It even appeared doubtful whether he was living, for he had ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the hou&s;es of his cu&s;tomary rendezvous &s;ome time be|fore the trial of La Motte; it was there|fore certain that his ab&s;ence was not oc|ca&s;ioned by any thing which had pa&s;&s;ed in the courts.</P>
<P>In the &s;olitude of his confinement the Marquis de Montalt had lei&s;ure to reflect on the pa&s;t, and to repent of his crimes; but reflection and repentance formed as yet no part of his di&s;po&s;ition. He turned with impatience from recollections which produced only pain, and looked forward to the future with an endeavour to avert the di&s;grace and puni&s;hment which he &s;aw impending. The elegance of his manners had &s;o effectually veiled the depravity of his heart, that he was a fa|vourite with his Sovereign; and on this circum&s;tance he re&s;ted his hope of &s;ecu|rity. He, however, &s;everely repented that he had indulged the ha&s;ty &s;pirit of revenge which had urged him to the pro|&s;ecution of La Motte, and had thus un|expectedly involved him in a &s;ituation dangerous&mdash;if not fatal&mdash;&s;ince if Adeline
<PB N="297" REF="296">
could not be found he would be concluded guilty of her death. But the appearance of d'Aunoy was the circum&s;tance he mo&s;t dreaded; and to oppo&s;e the po&s;&s;ibility of this, he employed &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries to di&s;cover his retreat, and to bribe him to his intere&s;t. The&s;e were, however, as un&s;ucce&s;sful in their re&s;earch as the officers of police, and the Marquis at length began to hope the man was really dead.</P>
<P>La Motte mean while awaited with trembling impatience the arrival of his &s;on, when he &s;hould be relieved, in &s;ome degree, from his uncertainty con|cerning Adeline. On his appearance he re&s;ted his only hope of life, &s;ince the evi|dence again&s;t him would lo&s;e much of its validity from the confirmation &s;he would give of the bad character of his pro&s;ecu|tor; and if the Parliament even con|demned La Motte, the clemency of the King might yet op rate in his favour.</P>
<P>Adeline arrived at Paris after a jour|ney of &s;everal days, during which &s;he was chiefly &s;upported by the delicate at|tentions of Louis, whom &s;he pitied and e&s;teemed, though &s;he could not love. She was immediately vi&s;ited at the hotel by Madame La Motte: the meeting was affecting on both &s;ides. A &s;en&s;e of her pa&s;t conduct excited in the latter an em|barra&s;&s;ment
<PB N="298" REF="297">
which the delicacy and good|ne&s;s of Adeline would willingly have &s;pared her; but the pardon &s;olicited was given with &s;o much &s;incerity, that Madame gra|dually became compo&s;ed and re-a&s;&s;ured. This forgivene&s;s, however, could not have been thus ea&s;ily granted, had Adeline be|lieved her former conduct was voluntary; a conviction of the re&s;traint and terror under which Madame had acted, alone induced her to excu&s;e the pa&s;t. In this fir&s;t meeting they forbore dwelling on particular &s;ubjects; Madame La Motte propo&s;ed that Adeline &s;hould remove from the hotel to her lodgings near the Chatelet, and Adeline, for whom a re&s;idence at a public hotel was very impro|per, gladly accepted the offer.</P>
<P>Madame there gave her a circum&s;tantial account of La Motte's &s;ituation, and con|cluded with &s;aying, that as the &s;entence of her hu&s;band had been &s;u&s;pended till &s;ome certainty could be obtained concerning the late criminal de&s;igns of the Marquis, and as Adeline could confirm the chief part of La Motte's te&s;timony, it was probable that now &s;he was arrived the Court would pro|ceed immediately. She now learnt the full extent of her obligation to La Motte; for &s;he was till now ignorant that when he &s;ent her from the fore&s;t he &s;aved her from death. Her horror of the Marquis, whom &s;he could
<PB N="299" REF="298">
not bear to con&s;ider as her father, and her gratitude to her deliverer, redoubled, and &s;he became impatient to give the te&s;timony &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the hopes of her pre&s;erver. Madame then &s;aid, &s;he believed it was not too late to gain admittance that night to the Chatelet; and as &s;he knew how anxiou&s;ly her hu&s;band wi&s;hed to &s;ee Adeline, &s;he en|treated her con&s;ent to go thither. Adeline, though much harra&s;&s;ed and fatigued, com|plied. When Louis returned from M. Nemcur's, his father's advocate, whom he had ha&s;tened to inform of her arrival, they all &s;et out for the Chatelet. The view of the pri&s;on into which they were now admit|ted &s;o forcibly recalled to Adeline's mind the &s;ituation of Theodore, that &s;he with difficul|ty &s;upported her&s;elf to the apartment of La Motte. When he &s;aw her, a gleam of joy pa&s;&s;ed over his countenance; but again relap&s;ing into de&s;pondency, he looked mournfully at her, and then at Louis, and groaned deeply. Adeline, in whom all remembrance of his former cruelty was lo&s;t in his &s;ub&s;equent kindne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed her thankfulne&s;s for the life he had pre&s;erved, and her anxiety to &s;erve him, in warm and repeated terms. But her gratitude evidently di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him; in&s;tead of reconciling him to him&s;elf, it &s;eemed to awaken a remem|brance of the guilty de&s;igns he had once
<PB N="300" REF="299">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and to &s;trike the pangs of con&s;cience deeper in his heart. Endeavouring to conceal his emotions, he entered on the &s;ubject of his pre&s;ent danger, and informed Adeline what te&s;timony would be required of her on the trial. After above an hour's conver&s;ation with La Motte, &s;he returned to the lodgings of Madame, where, languid and ill, &s;he withdrew to her chamber, and tried to obliviate her anxieties in &s;leep.</P>
<P>The Parliament which conducted the trial re-a&s;&s;embled in a few days after the arrival of Adeline, and the two remain|ing witne&s;&s;es of the Marquis, on whom he now re&s;ted his cau&s;e again&s;t La Motte, appeared. She was led trembling into the Court, where almo&s;t the fir&s;t object that met her eyes was the Marquis de Montalt, whom &s;he now beheld with an emotion en|tirely new to her, and which was &s;trongly tinctured with horror. When du Bo&s;&s;e &s;aw her, he immediately &s;wore to her identity; his te&s;timony was confirmed by her manner; for on perceiving him &s;he grew pale, and a univer&s;al tremor &s;eized her. Jean d'Aunoy could no where be found, and La Motte was thus deprived of an evidence which e&s;|&s;entially affected his intere&s;t. Adeline, when called upon, gave her little narrative with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion; and Peter, who had conveyed her from the Abbey,
<PB N="301" REF="300">
&s;upported the te&s;timony &s;he offered. The evidence produced was &s;ufficient to criminate the Marquis of the intention of murder, in the minds of mo&s;t people pre&s;ent; but it was not &s;ufficient to affect the te&s;timony of his two la&s;t witne&s;&s;es, who po&s;itively &s;wore to the commi&s;&s;ion of the robbery, and to the per&s;on of La Motte, on whom &s;entence of death was accordingly pronounced. On re|ceiving this &s;entence the unhappy criminal fainted, and the compa&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e feelings had been unu&s;ually intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion, was expre&s;&s;ed in a general groan.</P>
<P>Their attention was quickly called to a new object&mdash;it was Jean d'Aunoy who now entered the Court. But his evidence, if it could ever, indeed, have been the means of &s;aving La Motte, came too late. He was re-conducted to pri&s;on; but Ade|line, who, extremely &s;hocked by his &s;en|tence, was much indi&s;po&s;ed, received or|ders to remain in the Court during the ex|amination of d'Aunoy. This man had been at length found in the pri&s;on of a provincial town, where &s;ome of his creditors had thrown him, and from which even the mo|ney which the Marquis had remitted to him for the purpo&s;e of &s;atisfying the craving importunities of du Bo&s;&s;e, had been in|&s;ufficient to relea&s;e him. Meanwhile the
<PB N="302" REF="301">
revenge of the latter had been rou&s;ed again&s;t the Marquis by an imaginary neglect, and the money which was de&s;igned to relieve his nece&s;&s;ities was &s;pent by d'Aunoy in riotous luxury.</P>
<P>He was confronted with Adeline and with du Bo&s;&s;e, and ordered to confe&s;s all he knew concerning this my&s;terious affair, or to un|dergo the torture. D'Aunoy, who was ignorant how far the &s;u&s;picions concerning the Marquis extended, and who was con|&s;cious that his own words might condemn him, remained for &s;ome time ob&s;tinately &s;i|lent; but when the <HI>que&s;tion</HI> was admini&s;ter|ed his re&s;olution gave way, and he confe&s;&s;|ed a crime of which he had not even been &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>It appeared, that in the year 1642 d'Au|noy, together with one Jacques Martigny, and Francis Balliere, had way-laid, and &s;eized, Henry Marquis de Montalt, half|brother to Phillipe; and after having rob|bed him, and bound his &s;ervant to a tree, according to the orders they had received, they conveyed him to the Abbey of St. Clair, in the di&s;tant fore&s;t of Fontangville. Here he was confined for &s;ome time till farther directions were received from Phillipe de Montalt, the pre&s;ent Marquis, who was then on his e&s;tates in a northern province of France. The&s;e orders were for death,
<PB N="303" REF="302">
and the unfortunate Henry was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in his chamber in the third week of his con|finement at the Abbey.</P>
<P>On hearing this Adeline grew faint; &s;he remembered the M S. &s;he had found, together with the extraordinary circum|&s;tances that had attended the di&s;covery; every nerve thrilled with horror, and rai&s;ing her eyes &s;he &s;aw the countenance of the Marquis over&s;pread with the livid palene&s;s of guilt. She endeavoured, how|ever, to arre&s;t her fleeting &s;pirits while the man proceeded in his confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the murder was perpetrated, d'Au|noy had returned to his employer, who gave him the reward agreed upon, and in a few months after delivered into his hands the infant daughter of the late Marquis, whom he conveyed to a di&s;tant part of the kingdom, where, a&s;&s;uming the name of St. Pierre, he brought her up as his own child, receiving from the pre&s;ent Mar|quis a con&s;iderable annuity for his &s;e|crecy.</P>
<P>Adeline, no longer able to &s;truggle with the tumult of emotions that now ru&s;hed upon her heart, uttered a deep &s;igh and fainted away. She was carried from the Court, and, when the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by this circum&s;tance &s;ub&s;ided, Jean d'Au|noy went on. He related, that on the
<PB N="304" REF="303">
death of his wife, Adeline was placed in a convent, from whence &s;he was afterwards re|moved to another, where the Marquis had de&s;tined her to receive the vows. That her determined rejection of them had occa|&s;ioned him to re&s;olve upon her death, and that &s;he had accordingly been removed to the hou&s;e on the health. D'Aunoy added, that by the Marquis's order he had mi&s;led du Bo&s;&s;e with a fal&s;e &s;tory of her birth. Hav|ing after &s;ome time di&s;covered that his com|rades had deceived him concerning her death, d'Aunoy &s;eparated from them in enmity; but they unanimou&s;ly determined to conceal her e&s;cape from the Marquis, that they might enjoy the recompence of their &s;uppo&s;ed crime. Some months &s;ub&s;equent to this period, however, d'Aunoy received a letter from the Marquis, charging him with the truth, and promi&s;ing him a large reward if he would confe&s;s where he had placed Adeline. In con&s;equence of this letter he acknowledged that &s;he had been given into the hands of a &s;tranger; but who he was, or where he lived, was not known.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e depo&s;itions Phillipe de Mon|talt was committed to take his trial for the murder of Henry, his brother; d'Aunoy was thrown into a dungeon of the Chate|let, and du Bo&s;&s;e was bound to appear as evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="304">
The feelings of the Marquis, who, in a pro&s;ecution &s;timulated by revenge, had thus unexpectedly expo&s;ed his crimes to the public eye, and betrayed him&s;elf to ju&s;tice, can only be imagined. The pa&s;&s;ions which had tempted him to the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime &s;o horrid as that of murder&mdash;and what, if po&s;&s;ible, heightened its atrocity, the murder of one connected with him by the ties of blood, and by habits of even infan|tine a&s;&s;ociation&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ions which had &s;timulated him to &s;o mon&s;trous a deed were ambition, and the love of plea&s;ure. The fir&s;t was more immediately gratified by the title of his brother; the latter by the riches which would enable him to indulge his vo|luptuous inclinations.</P>
<P>The late Marquis de Montalt, the father of Adeline, received from his ance&s;tors a patrimony very inadequate to &s;upport the &s;plendour of his rank; but he had married the heire&s;s of an illu&s;trious family, who&s;e fortune amply &s;upplied the deficiency of his own. He had the misfortune to lo&s;e her, for &s;he was amiable and beautiful, &s;oon after the birth of a daughter, and it was then that the pre&s;ent Marquis formed the diabolical de&s;ign of de&s;troying his brother. The con|tra&s;t of their characters prevented that cor|dial regard between them which their near relation&s;hip &s;eemed to demand. Henry was
<PB N="306" REF="305">
benevolent, mild, and contemplative. In his heart reigned the love of virtue; in his manners the &s;trictne&s;s of ju&s;tne&s;s was tem|pered, not weakened, by mercy; his mind was enlarged by &s;cience, and adorned by elegant literature. The character of Phil|lipe has been already delineated in his ac|tions; its nicer &s;hades were blended with &s;ome &s;hining tints; but the&s;e &s;erved only to render more &s;triking by contra&s;t the general darkne&s;s of the portrait.</P>
<P>He had married a lady, who, by the death of her brother, inherited con&s;iderable e&s;tates, of which the Abbey of St. Clair, and the villa on the borders of the fore&s;t of Fontangville, were the chief. His pa&s;&s;ion for magnificence and di&s;&s;ipation, however, &s;oon involved him in difficulties, and point|ed out to him the conveniency of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his brother's wealth. His brother and his infant daughter only &s;tood between him and his wi&s;hes; how he removed the father has been already related; why he did not em|ploy the &s;ame means to &s;ecure the child, &s;eems &s;omewhat &s;urprizing, unle&s;s we ad|mit that a de&s;tiny hung over him on this occa&s;ion, and that &s;he was &s;uffered to live as an in&s;trument to puni&s;h the murderer of her parent. When a retro&s;pect is taken of the vici&s;&s;itudes and dangers to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed from her earlie&s;t infancy, it ap|pears
<PB N="307" REF="306">
as if her pre&s;ervation was the effect of &s;omething more than human policy, and affords a &s;triking in&s;tance that Ju&s;tice, how|ever long delayed, will overtake the guilty.</P>
<P>While the late unhappy Marquis was &s;uffering at the Abbey, his brother, who, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, remained in the north of France, delayed the execution of his horrid purpo&s;e from a timidity natural to a mind not yet inured to enormous guilt. Before he dared to deliver his final orders he waited to know whether the &s;tory he con|trived to propagate of his brother's death would veil his crime from &s;u&s;picion. It &s;uc|ceeded but too well; for the &s;ervant, who&s;e life had been &s;pared that he might relate the tale, naturally enough concluded that his Lord had been murdered by Banditti; and the pea&s;ant, who a few hours after found the &s;ervant wounded, bleeding, and bound to a tree, and knew al&s;o that this &s;pot was infe&s;ted by robbers, as naturally believed him, and &s;pread the report accordingly.</P>
<P>From this period the Marquis, to whom the Abbey of St. Clair belonged in right of his wife, vi&s;ited it only twice, and that at di&s;tant times, till after an interval of &s;everal years he accidentally found La Motte its in|habitant. He re&s;ided at Paris, and on his e&s;tate in the north, except that once a year he u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed a month at his delightful
<PB N="308" REF="307">
villa on the borders of the fore&s;t. In the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the Court, and in the di&s;&s;ipa|tions of plea&s;ure, he tried to lo&s;e the remem|brance of his guilt; but there were times when the voice of con&s;cience would be heard, though it was &s;oon again lo&s;t in the tumult of the world.</P>
<P>It is probable, that on the night of his abrupt departure from the Abbey, the &s;oli|tary &s;ilence and gloom of the hour, in a place which had been the &s;cene of his former crime, called up the remembrance of his brother with a force too powerful for fancy, and awakened horrors which compelled him to quit the polluted &s;pot. If it was &s;o, it is however certain that the &s;pectres of con|&s;cience vani&s;hed with the darkne&s;s; for on the following day he returned to the Abbey, though it may be ob&s;erved, he never at|tempted to pa&s;s another night there. But though terror was rou&s;ed for a tran&s;ient mo|ment, neither pity or repentance &s;ucceeded, &s;ince when the di&s;covery of Adeline's birth excited apprehen&s;ion for his own life, he did not he&s;itate to repeat the crime, and would again have &s;tained his &s;oul with hu|man blood. This di&s;covery was effected by means of a &s;eal, bearing the arms of her mother's family, which was impre&s;&s;ed on the note his &s;ervant had found, and had de|livered to him at Caux. It may be remem|bered, that having read this note, he was
<PB N="309" REF="308">
throwing it from him in the fury of jea|lou&s;y; but that after examining it again, it was carefully depo&s;ited in his pocket-book. The violent agitation which a &s;u&s;picion of this terrible truth occa&s;ioned deprived him for a while of all power to act. When he was well enough to write he di&s;patched a letter to d'Aunoy, the purport of which has been already mentioned. From d'Aunoy he received the confirmation of his fears. Knowing that his life mu&s;t pay the forfei|ture of his crime, &s;hould Adeline ever obtain a knowledge of her birth, and not daring again to confide in the &s;ecrecy of a man who had once deceived him, he re&s;olved, after &s;ome deliberation, on her death. He im|mediately &s;et out for the Abbey, and gave tho&s;e directions concerning her which terror for his own &s;afety, &s;till more than a de&s;ire of retaining her e&s;tates, &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>As the hi&s;tory of the &s;eal which revealed the birth of Adeline is rather remarkable, it may not be ami&s;s to mention, that it was &s;tolen from the Marquis, together with a gold watch, by Jean d'Aunoy: the watch was &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed of, but the &s;eal had been kept as a pretty trinket by his wife, and at her death went with Adeline among her clothes to the convent. Adeline had care|fully pre&s;erved it, becau&s;e it had once be|longed to the woman whom &s;he believed to have been her mother.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE now return to the cour&s;e of the nar|rative, and to Adeline, who was carried from the court to the lodging of Madame De la Motte. Madame was, however, at the Chatelet with her hu&s;band, &s;uffering all the di&s;tre&s;s which the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him might be &s;uppo&s;ed to inflict. The feeble frame of Adeline, &s;o long har|ra&s;&s;ed by grief and fatigue, almo&s;t &s;unk un|der the agitation which the di&s;covery of her birth excited. Her feelings on this occa&s;ion were too complex to be analy&s;ed. From an orphan, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the bounty of others, without family, with few friends, and pur|&s;ued by a cruel and powerful enemy, &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;uddenly transformed to the daughter of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e, and the heire&s;s of im|men&s;e wealth. But &s;he learned al&s;o that her father had been murdered&mdash;murdered in the prime of his days&mdash;murdered by means of his brother, again&s;t whom &s;he mu&s;t now appear, and in puni&s;hing the de&s;troyer of her parent doom her uncle to death.</P>
<P>When &s;he remembered the manu&s;cript &s;o fingularly found, and con&s;idered that when &s;he wept for the &s;ufferings it de&s;cribed, her tears had flowed for tho&s;e of her father, her emotion cannot ea&s;ily be imagined. The
<PB N="311" REF="310">
circum&s;tances attending the di&s;covery of the&s;e and papers no longer appeared to be a work of chance, but of a Power who&s;e de&s;igns are great and ju&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"O my father!"</Q> &s;he would exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"your la&s;t wi&s;h is fulfilled&mdash;the pitying heart you wi&s;hed might trace your &s;uf|ferings &s;hall avenge them."</Q></P>
<P>On the return of Madame La Motte Adeline endeavoured, as u&s;ual, to &s;up|pre&s;s her own emotions, that &s;he might &s;ooth the affliction of her friend. She related what had pa&s;&s;ed in the courts af|ter the departure of La Motte, and thus excited, even in the &s;orrowful heart of Madame, a momentary gleam of &s;ati&s;|faction. Adeline determined to recover, if po&s;&s;ible, the manu&s;cript. On inquiry &s;he learned that La Motte, in the con|fu&s;ion of his departure, had left it among other things at the Abbey. This cir|cum&s;tance much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, the more &s;o becau&s;e &s;he believed its appearance might be of importance on the approach|ing trial: &s;he determined, however, if &s;he &s;hould recover her rights, to have the manu&s;cript &s;ought for.</P>
<P>In the evening Louis joined this mournful party: he came immediately from his father, whom he left more tran|quil than he had been &s;ince the fatal &s;en|tence was pronounced. After a &s;ilent
<PB N="312" REF="311">
and melancholy &s;upper they &s;eparated for the night, and Adeline, in the &s;oli|tude of her chamber, had lei&s;ure to me|ditate on the di&s;coveries of this eventful day. The &s;ufferings of her dead father, &s;uch as &s;he had read them recorded by his <HI>own hand,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t forcibly to her thoughts. The narrative had for|merly &s;o much affected her heart, and intere&s;ted her imagination, that her me|mory now faithfully reflected each parti|cular circum&s;tance there di&s;clo&s;ed. But when &s;he con&s;idered that &s;he had been in the very chamber where her parent had &s;uffered, where even his life had been &s;acrificed, and that &s;he had probably &s;een the very dagger, &s;een it &s;tained with ru&s;t, the ru&s;t of blood! by which he had fallen, the angui&s;h and horror of her mind defied all controul.</P>
<P>On the following day Adeline received orders to prepare for the pro&s;ecution of the Marquis de Montalt, which was to commence as &s;oon as the requi&s;ite wit|ne&s;&s;es could be collected. Among the&s;e were the Abbe&s;s of the Convent, who had received her from the hands of d'Aunoy; Madame La Motte, who was pre&s;ent when Du Bo&s;&s;e compelled her hu&s;band to receive Adeline; and Peter, who had not only been witne&s;s to this circum&s;tance, but who had conveyed her
<PB N="313" REF="312">
from the Abbey that &s;he might e&s;cape the de&s;igns of the Marquis. La Motte, and Theodore La Luc, were incapaci|tated by the &s;entence of the law from appearing on the trial.</P>
<P>When La Motte was informed of the di&s;covery of Adeline's birth, and that her father had been murdered at the Abbey of St. Clair, he in&s;tantly remembred, and mentioned to his wife, the &s;keleton he found in the &s;tone room leading to the &s;ubterranean cells. Neither of them doubted, from the &s;ituation in which it lay, hid in a che&s;t in an ob&s;cure room &s;trongly guarded, that La Motte had &s;een the remains of the late Marquis. Madame, however, determined not to &s;hock Adeline with the mention of this circum&s;tance till it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to declare it on the trial.</P>
<P>As the time of this trial drew near, the di&s;tre&s;s and agitation of Adeline in|crea&s;ed. Though ju&s;tice demanded the life of the murderer, and though the tenderne&s;s and pity which the idea of her father called forth urged her to avenge his death, &s;he could not, without horror, con&s;ider her&s;elf as the in&s;trument of di&s;pen&s;ing that ju&s;tice which would deprive a fellow-being of exi&s;tence; and there were times when &s;he wi&s;hed the &s;ecret of her birth had never been revealed. If this &s;en&s;ibility was, in her peculiar
<PB N="314" REF="313">
circum&s;tances, a weakne&s;s, it was at lea&s;t an amiable one, and as &s;uch de&s;erves to be re|verenced.</P>
<P>The accounts &s;he received from Vaceau of the health of M. La Luc did not contri|bute to tranquillize her mind. The &s;ymptoms de&s;cribed by Clara &s;eemed to &s;ay that he was in the la&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;umption, and the grief of Theodore and her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion was expre&s;|&s;ed in her letters with the lively eloquence &s;o natural to her. Adeline loved and re|vered La Luc for his own worth, and for the parental tenderne&s;s he had &s;hewed her, but he was &s;till dearer to her as the father of Theodore, and her concern for his declining &s;tate was not inferior to that of his children. It was increa&s;ed by the reflection that &s;he had probably been the means of &s;hortening his life, for &s;he too well knew that the di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned him by the &s;ituation in which it had been her misfortune to involve Theodore, had &s;hat|tered his frame to its pre&s;ent infirmity. The &s;ame cau&s;e al&s;o with-held him from &s;eeking in the climate of Montpellier the relief he had formerly been taught to expect there. When &s;he looked round on the condition of her friends, her heart was almo&s;t over|whelmed with the pro&s;pect; it &s;eemed as if &s;he was de&s;tined to involve all tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to her in calamity. With re&s;pect to La Motte, whatever were his vices, and
<PB N="315" REF="314">
whatever the de&s;igns in which he had for|merly engaged again&s;t her, &s;he forgot them all in the &s;ervice he had finally rendered her, and con&s;idered it to be as much her duty, as &s;he felt it to be her inclination, to intercede in his behalf. This, however, in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;he could not do with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s; but if the &s;uit, upon which depended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her rank, her fortune, and con&s;equently her influence, &s;hould be decided in her favour, &s;he determined to throw her&s;elf at the king's feet, and, when &s;he pleaded the cau&s;e of Theodore, a&s;k the life of La Motte.</P>
<P>A few days preceding that of the trial Adeline was informed a &s;tranger de&s;ired to &s;peak with her, and on going to the room where he was, &s;he found M. Verneuil. Her countenance expre&s;&s;ed both &s;urprize and &s;atisfaction at this unexpected meeting, and &s;he inquired, though with little expec|tation of an affirmative, if he had heard of M. La Luc. <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een him,"</Q> &s;aid M. Verneuil; <Q REND="inline">"I am ju&s;t come from Vaceau. But I am &s;orry I cannot give you a better account of his health. He is greatly altered &s;ince I &s;aw him before."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline could &s;carcely refrain from tears at the recollection the&s;e words revived of the calamities which had occa&s;ioned this la|mented change. M. Verneuil delivered her a packet from Clara; as he pre&s;ented it he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ide this introduction to your no|tice, I have a claim of a different kind, which I am proud to a&s;&s;ert, and which
<PB N="316" REF="315">
which will perhaps ju&s;tify the permi&s;&s;ion I a&s;k of &s;peaking upon your affairs."&mdash;</Q>Adeline bowed, and M. Verneuil, with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t ten|der &s;olicitude, added that he had heard of the late proceeding of the parliament of Paris, and of the di&s;coveries that &s;o intimately concerned her. <Q REND="inline">"I know not,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"whether I ought to congratulate or condole with you on this trying occa&s;ion. That I &s;incerely &s;ympathize in all that concerns you I hope you will believe, and I cannot deny my|&s;elf the plea&s;ure of telling you that I am related, though di&s;tantly, to the late Marchione&s;s, your mother, for that &s;he <HI>was your mother</HI> I cannot doubt."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline ro&s;e ha&s;tily and advanced towards M. Verneuil; &s;urprize and &s;atisfaction re|animated her features. <Q REND="inline">"Do I indeed &s;ee a relation?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he in a &s;weet and tremulous voice, <Q REND="inline">"and one whom I can welcome as a friend?"</Q> Tears trembled in her eyes; and &s;he received M. Verneuil's embrace in &s;ilence. It was &s;ome time before her emo|tion would permit her to &s;peak.</P>
<P>To Adeline, who from her earlie&s;t infan|cy had been abandoned to &s;trangers, a for|lorn and helple&s;s orphan; who had never till lately known a relation, and who then found one in the per&s;on of an inveterate ene|my, to her this di&s;covery was as delightful as unexpected. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t after &s;truggling for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">
emotions that <PB N="317" REF="316">
pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart, &s;he begged M. Ver|neuil permi&s;&s;ion to withdraw till &s;he could recover compo&s;ure. He would have taken leave, but &s;he entreated him not to go.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t which M. Verneuil took in the concerns of La Luc, which was &s;trength|ened by his increa&s;ing regard for Clara, had drawn him to Vaceau, where he was in|formed of the family and peculiar circum|&s;tances of Adeline. On receiving this in|telligence he immediately &s;et out for Paris to offer his protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his newly-di&s;covered relation, and to aid, if po&s;&s;ible, the cau&s;e of Theodore.</P>
<P>Adeline in a &s;hort time returned, and could then bear to conver&s;e on the &s;ubject of her family. M. Verneuil offered her his &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if they &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary. <Q REND="inline">"But I tru&s;t,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"to the ju&s;tne&s;s of your cau&s;e, and hope it will not require any adventitious aid. To tho&s;e who remember the late Marchione&s;s, your features bring &s;ufficient evidence of your birth. As a proof that my judgment in this in&s;tance is not bia&s;&s;ed by prejudice, the re&s;emblance &s;truck me when I was in Savoy, though I knew the Marchione&s;s only by her portrait; and I believe I mentioned to M. La Luc that you often reminded me of a decea&s;ed relation. You may form &s;ome judgment of this your&s;elf,"</Q> added M. Verneuil, taking a miniature from
<PB N="318" REF="317">
his pocket. <Q REND="inline">"This was your amiable mo|ther."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline's countenance changed; &s;he re|ceived the picture eagerly, gazed on it for a long time in &s;ilence, and her eyes filled with tears. It was not the re&s;emblance &s;he &s;tudied, but the countenance&mdash;the mild and beautiful countenance of her parent, who&s;e blue eyes, full of tender &s;weetne&s;s, &s;eemed bent upon her's; while a &s;oft &s;mile played on her lips; Adeline pre&s;&s;ed the picture to her's, and again gazed in &s;ilent reverie. At length, with a deep &s;igh, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This &s;urely <HI>was</HI> my mother. Had &s;he <HI>but</HI> lived, O my poor father! you had been &s;pared."</Q> This reflection quite overcame her, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. M. Verneuil did not interrupt her grief, but took her hand and &s;at by her without &s;peak|ing till &s;he became more compo&s;ed. Again ki&s;&s;ing the picture, &s;he held it out to him with a he&s;itating look. <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"it is already with its true owner."</Q> She thank|ed him with a &s;mile of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s, and after &s;ome conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the approaching trial, on which occa&s;ion &s;he reque&s;ted M. Verneuil would &s;upport her by his pre&s;ence, he withdrew, having begged leave to repeat his vi&s;it on the following day.</P>
<P>Adeline now opened her packet, and &s;aw once more the well-known characters of
<PB N="319" REF="318">
Theodore; for a moment &s;he felt as if in his pre&s;ence, and the con&s;cious blu&s;h over&s;pread her cheek; with a trembling hand &s;he broke the &s;eal, and read the tendere&s;t a&s;&s;urances and &s;olicitudes of his love; &s;he often pau&s;ed that &s;he might prolong the &s;weet emotions which the&s;e a&s;&s;urances awakened, but while tears of tenderne&s;s &s;tood trembling on her eyelids, the bitter recollection of his &s;ituati|on would return, and they fell in angui&s;h on her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>He congratulated her, and with peculiar delicacy, on the pro&s;pects of life which were opening to her; &s;aid every thing that might tend to animate and &s;upport her, but avoided dwelling on his own circum&s;tances, except by expre&s;&s;ing his &s;en&s;e of the zeal and kind|ne&s;s of his commanding officer, and adding, that he did not de&s;pair of finally obtaining a pardon.</P>
<P>This hope, though but faintly expre&s;&s;ed, and written evidently for the purpo&s;e of con|&s;oling Adeline, did not entirely fail of the de&s;ired effect. She yielded to its enchanting influence, and forgot for a while the many &s;ubjects of care and anxiety which &s;urround|ed her. Theodore &s;aid little of his father's health; what he did &s;ay was by no means &s;o di&s;couraging as the accounts of Clara, who, le&s;s anxious to conceal a truth that mu&s;t give pain to Adeline, expre&s;&s;ed, with|out

<P>THE day of the trial &s;o anxiou&s;ly awaited, and on which the fate of &s;o many per&s;ons depended, at length arrived. Adeline, ac|companied by M. Verneuil and Madame la Motte, appeared as the pro&s;ecutor of the Marquis de Montalt; and d'Aunoy, du Bo&s;&s;e, Louis de la Motte, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, as witne&s;s in her cau&s;e. The judges were &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in France; and the advocates on both &s;ides men of eminent abilities. On a trial of &s;uch im|portance the court, as may be imagined, was crowded with per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and the &s;pectacle it pre&s;ented was &s;trikingly &s;o|lemn, yet magnificent.</P>
<P>When &s;he appeared before the tribunal, Adeline's emotion &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the arts of di&s;gui&s;e, but adding to the natural dignity of her air an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;oft timidity, and to her downca&s;t eyes a &s;weet confu&s;ion, it rendered her an object &s;till more intere&s;ting; and &s;he attracted the univer&s;al pity and ad|miration

of the a&s;&s;embly. When &s;he ven|tured to rai&s;e her eyes, &s;he perceived that the Marquis was not yet in the court, and while &s;he awaited his appearance in tremb|ling expectation, a confu&s;ed murmuring ro&s;e in a di&s;tant part of the hall. Her &s;pirits now almo&s;t for&s;ook her; the certainty of &s;eeing immediately, and con&s;ciou&s;ly, the murderer of her father, chilled her with horror, and &s;he was with difficulty pre&s;erved from fainting. A low &s;ound now ran through the court, and an air of confu&s;ion appeared, which was &s;oon communicated to the tribunal it&s;elf. Several of the members aro&s;e, &s;ome left the hall, the whole place exhibited a &s;cene of di&s;order, and a report at length reached Ade|line that the Marquis de Montalt was dying. A con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed in uncertainty; but the confu&s;ion continued; the Marquis did not appear; and at Adeline's reque&s;t M. Verneuil went in que&s;t of more po&s;itive in|formation.</P>
<P>He followed a crowd which was hurrying towards the Chatelet, and with &s;ome diffi|culty gained admittance into the pri&s;on; but the porter at the gate, whom he had bribed for a pa&s;&s;port, could give him no certain information on the &s;ubject of his enquiry, and not being at liberty to quit his po&s;t, fur|ni&s;hed M. Verneuil with only a vague di|rection to the Marquis's apartment. The courts were &s;ilent and de&s;erted, but as he
<PB N="322" REF="321">
advanced a di&s;tant hum of voices led him on, &s;till perceiving &s;everal per&s;ons running to|wards a &s;tairca&s;e which appeared beyond the archway of a long pa&s;&s;age, he followed thi|ther, and learned that the Marquis was cer|tainly dying. The &s;tairca&s;e was filled with people; he endeavoured to pre&s;s through the crowd, and after much &s;truggle and dif|ficulty he reached the door of an anti-room which communicated with the apartment where the Marquis lay, and whence &s;everal per&s;ons now i&s;&s;ued. Here he learned that the object of his enquiry was already dead. M. Verneuil, however, pre&s;&s;ed through the anti-room to the chamber where lay the Marquis on a bed &s;urrounded by officers of the law, and two notaries, who appeared to have been taking down depo&s;itions. His countenance was &s;uffu&s;ed with a black, and deadly hue, and impre&s;&s;ed with the horrors of death; M. Verneuil turned away, &s;hock|ed by the &s;pectacle, and on enquiry heard that the Marquis had died by poi&s;on.</P>
<P>It appeared that convinced he had nothing to hope from his trial, he had taken this me|thod of avoiding an ignominious death. In the la&s;t hours of life, while tortured with the remembrance of his crime, he re&s;olv|ed to make all the atonement that remained for him, and having &s;wallowed the potion, he immediately &s;ent for a confe&s;&s;or to take a full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, and two nota|ries,
<PB N="323" REF="322">
and thus e&s;tabli&s;hed Adeline beyond di&s;pute in the rights of her birth; and al|&s;o bequeathed her a con&s;iderable legacy.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e depo&s;itions &s;he was &s;oon after formally acknowledged as the daughter and heire&s;s of Henry Marquis de Montalt, and the rich e&s;tates of her father were re&s;tored to her. She immediately threw her&s;elf at the feet of the king in be|half of Theodore and of La Motte. The character of the former, the cau&s;e in which he had ri&s;ked his life, and the occa&s;ion of the late Marquis's enmity towards him, were circum&s;tances &s;o notorious, and &s;o forcible, that it is more than probable the monarch would have granted his pardon to a pleader le&s;s irre&s;i&s;tible than was Adeline de Mon|talt. Theodore La Luc not only received an ample pardon, but in con&s;ideration of his gallant conduct towards Adeline, he was &s;oon after rai&s;ed to a po&s;t of con&s;iderable rank in the army.</P>
<P>For La Motte, who had been condemned for the robbery on full evidence, and who had been al&s;o charged with the crime which had formerly compelled him to quit Paris, a pardon could not be obtained; but at the earne&s;t &s;upplication of Adeline, and in con|&s;ideration of the &s;ervice he had finally ren|dered her, his &s;entence was &s;oftened from death to bani&s;hment. This indulgence, however, would have availed him little, had
<PB N="324" REF="323">
not the noble genero&s;ity of Adeline &s;ilenced other pro&s;ecutions that were preparing a|gain&s;t him, and be&s;towed on him a &s;um more than &s;ufficient to &s;upport his family in a foreign country. This kindne&s;s operated &s;o powerfully upon his heart, which had been betrayed through weakne&s;s rather than natural depravity, and awakened &s;o keen a a remor&s;e for the injuries he had once me|ditated again&s;t a benefactre&s;s &s;o noble, that his former habits became odious to him, and his character gradually recovered the hue which it would probably always have worn had he never been expo&s;ed to the tempting di&s;&s;ipations of Paris.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion which Louis had &s;o long own|ed for Adeline was rai&s;ed almo&s;t to adoration by her late conduct; but he now relinqui&s;h|ed even the &s;aint hope which he had hitherto almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly cheri&s;hed, and, &s;ince the life which was granted to Theodore rendered this &s;acrifice nece&s;&s;ary, he could not repine. He re&s;olved, how|ever, to &s;eek in ab&s;ence the tranquility he had lo&s;t, and to place his future happine&s;s on that of two per&s;ons &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to him.</P>
<P>On the eve of his departure La Motte and his family took a very affecting leave of Ade|line; he left Paris for England, where it was his de&s;ign to &s;ettle; and Louis, who was eager to fly from her enchantments, &s;et out on the &s;ame day for his regiment.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="324">
Adeline remained &s;ome time at Paris to &s;ettle her affairs, where &s;he was introduced by M. V&mdash; to the few and di&s;tant re|lations that remained of her family. Among the&s;e were the Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, and the Mon. Amand, who had &s;o much engaged her pity and e&s;teem at Nice. The lady, who&s;e death he lamented, was of the family of de Montalt; and the re&s;emblance which he had traced between her features and tho&s;e of Adeline, her cou&s;in, was &s;ome|thing more than the effect of fancy. The death of his elder brother had abruptly re|called him from Italy; but Adeline had the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve, that the heavy melancholy which formerly oppre&s;&s;ed him, had yielded to a &s;ort of placid re&s;ignation, and that his countenance was often enliven|ed by a tran&s;ient gleam of cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, who were much intere&s;ted by her goodne&s;s and beauty, invited her to make their hotel her re&s;idence while &s;he remained at Paris.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t care was to have the remains of her parent removed from the Abbey of St. Clair, and depo&s;ited in the vault of his an|ce&s;tors. D'Aunoy was tried, condemned, and hanged, for the murder. At the place of execution he had de&s;cribed the &s;pot where the remains of the Marquis were concealed, which was in the &s;tone-room already men|tioned, belonging to the Abbey. M. V&mdash; accompanied the officers appointed for the &s;earch, and attended the a&s;hes of the Mar|quis to St. Maur, an e&s;tate in one of the northern provinces. There they were depo|&s;ited with the &s;olemn funeral pomp becoming his rank. Adeline attended as chief mourn|er;
<PB N="326" REF="325">
and this la&s;t duty paid to the memory of her parent, &s;he became more tranquil and re&s;igned. The MS. that recorded his &s;uf|ferings had been found at the Abbey, and delivered to her by M. V&mdash;, and &s;he pre&s;erved it with the pious enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;o &s;acred a relique de&s;erved.</P>
<P>On her return to Paris, Theodore La Luc, who was come from Montpelier, awaited her arrival. The happine&s;s of this meeting was clouded by the account he brought of his father, who&s;e extreme dan|ger had alone withheld him from ha&s;tening, the moment he obtained his liberty, to thank Adeline for the life &s;he had pre&s;erved. She now received him as the friend to whom &s;he was indebted for her pre&s;ervation, and as the lover who de&s;erved, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, her tendere&s;t affection The remembrance of the circum&s;tances under which they had la&s;t met, and of their mutual angui&s;h, render|ed more exqui&s;ite the happine&s;s of the pre|&s;ent moments, when no longer oppre&s;&s;ed by the horrid pro&s;pect of ignominious death and final &s;eparation, they looked forward only to the &s;miling days that awaited them when hand in hand they &s;hould tread the flowery &s;cenes of life. The contra&s;t which memo|ry drew of the pa&s;t with the pre&s;ent, fre|quently drew tears of tenderne&s;s and grati|tude to their eyes, and the &s;weet &s;mile which &s;eemed &s;truggling to di&s;pel from the coun|tenance of Adeline tho&s;e gems of &s;orrow, penetrated the heart of Theodore, and brought to his recollection a little &s;ong which in other circum&s;tances he had formerly &s;ung to her. He took up a lute that lay on the table, and touching the dulcet chords, ac|companied it with the following words:
<Q><PB N="327" REF="326">
<LG TYPE="song">
<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>The ro&s;e that weeps with morning dew,</L>
<L>And glitters in the &s;unny ray,</L>
<L>In tears and &s;miles re&s;embles you,</L>
<L>When Love breaks Sorrow's cloud away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dews that bend the blu&s;hing flow'r,</L>
<L>Enrich the &s;cent&mdash;renew the glow;</L>
<L>So Love's &s;weet tears exalt his pow'r,</L>
<L>So bli&s;s more brightly &s;hines by woe!</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Her affection for Theodore had induced Adeline to reject &s;everal &s;uitors which her goodne&s;s, beauty, and wealth, had already attracted, and whom, though infinitely his &s;uperiors in point of fortune, were many of them inferior to him in family, and all of them in merit.</P>
<P>The various and tumultuous emotions which the late events had called forth in the bo&s;om of Adeline were now &s;ub|&s;ided; but the memory of her father &s;till tinctured her mind with a melan|choly that time only could &s;ubdue; and &s;he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to the &s;upplications of Theodore till the period &s;he had pre|&s;cribed for her mourning &s;hould be ex|pired. The nece&s;&s;ity of re-joining his regiment obliged him to leave Paris within the fortnight after his arrival; but he carried with him a&s;&s;urance of receiv|ing her hand &s;oon after &s;he &s;hould lay a&s;ide her &s;able habit, and departed therefore with tolerable compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>M. La Luc's very precarious &s;tate was a &s;ource of ince&s;&s;ant di&s;quietude to Ade|line, and &s;he determined to accompany M. V&mdash;, who was now the declared lover of Clara, to Montpelier, whither La Luc had immediately gone on the liberation of his &s;on. For this journey
<PB N="328" REF="327">
&s;he was preparing when &s;he received from her friend a flattering account of his amendment; and as &s;ome farther &s;et|tlement of her affairs required her pre|&s;ence at Paris, &s;he deferred her de&s;ign, and M. V&mdash; departed alone.</P>
<P>When Theodore's affairs a&s;&s;umed a more favourable a&s;pect, M. Verneuil had written to La Luc, and communicated to him the &s;ecret of his heart re&s;pect|ing Clara. La Luc, who admired and e&s;teemed M. V&mdash;, and who was not ignorant of his family connections, was plea&s;ed with the propo&s;ed alliance; Clara thought &s;he had never &s;een any per&s;on whom &s;he was &s;o much inclined to love; and M. V&mdash; received an an|&s;wer favourable to his wi&s;hes, and which encouraged him to undertake the pre&s;ent journey to Montpelier.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of his happine&s;s and the climate of Montpelier did all for the health of La Luc that his mo&s;t anxious friends could wi&s;h, and he was at length &s;o far recovered as to vi&s;it Adeline at her e&s;tate of St. Maur. Clara and M. V&mdash; accompanied him, and a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;|tilities between France and Spain &s;oon after permitted Theodore to join this happy party. When La Luc, thus re&s;tored to tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to him, looked back on the mi&s;eries he had e&s;caped, and forward to the ble&s;&s;ings that awaited him, his heart dilated with emotions of exqui&s;ite joy and gratitude; and his venerable countenance, &s;oftened by an expre&s;&s;ion of complacent delight, exhibited a perfect picture of happy age.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADELINE, in the &s;ociety of friends &s;o beloved, lo&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of that melan|choly which the fate of her parent had occa&s;ioned; &s;he recovered all her natural vi|vacity; and when &s;he threw off the mourning habit which filial piety had required her to a&s;&s;ume, &s;he gave her hand to Theodore. The nuptials, which were celebrated at St. Maur, were graced by the pre&s;ence of the Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, and La Luc had the &s;upreme felicity of confirming on the &s;ame day the flattering de&s;tinies of both his children. When the ceremony was over he ble&s;&s;ed and embraced them all with tears of fatherly affection. <Q REND="inline">"I thank thee O God! that I have been permitted to &s;ee this hour;"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e thee to call me hence, I &s;hall depart in peace."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Long, very long, may you be &s;pared to ble&s;s your children,"</Q> replied Adeline. Cla|ra ki&s;&s;ed her father's hand and wept: <Q REND="inline">"Long, very long,"</Q> &s;he repeated in a voice &s;carce|ly audible. La Luc &s;miled cheerfully, and turned the conver&s;ation to a &s;ubject le&s;s affect|ing.</P>
<P>But the time now drew nigh when La Luc thought it nece&s;&s;ary to return to the du|ties of his pari&s;h, from which he had &s;o long
<PB N="330" REF="329">
been ab&s;ent. Madame La Luc too, who had attended him during the period of his danger at Montpelier, and hence returned to Savoy, complained much of the &s;olitude of her life; and this was with her brother an additional motive for his &s;peedy departure. Theodore and Adeline, who could not &s;upport the thought of a &s;eparation, endeavoured to per&s;uade him to give up his chateau, and to re&s;ide with them in France; but he was held by many ties to Leloncourt. For many years he had con&s;tituted the comfort and hap|pine&s;s of his pari&s;hioners; they revered and loved him as a father&mdash;he regarded them with an affection little &s;hort of parental. The attachment they di&s;covered towards him on his departure was not forgotten either; it had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, and he could not bear the thought of for&s;ak|ing them now that Heaven had &s;howered on him its abundance. <Q REND="inline">"It is &s;weet to live for them,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and I will al&s;o die among&s;t them."</Q> A &s;entiment al&s;o of a more tender nature,&mdash;(and let not the &s;to|ic prophane it with the name of weakne&s;s, or the man of the world &s;corn it as unnatu|ral)&mdash;a &s;entiment &s;till more tender attracted him to Leloncourt,&mdash;the remains of his wife repo&s;ed there.</P>
<P>Since La Luc would not re&s;ide in France, Theodore and Adeline, to whom the &s;plen|did gaieties that courted them at Paris were very inferior temptations to the &s;weet do|me&s;tic plea&s;ures and refined &s;ociety which Leloncourt would afford, determined to accompany La Luc and Mon. and Madame Verneuil abroad. Adeline arranged her af|fairs &s;o as to render her re&s;idence in France
<PB N="331" REF="330">
unnece&s;&s;ary; and having bade an affection|ate adieu to the Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, and to M. Amand, who had recovered a tole|rable degree of cheerfulne&s;s, &s;he departed with her friends for Savoy.</P>
<P>They travelled lei&s;urely, and frequently turned out of their way to view whatever was worthy of ob&s;ervation. After a long and plea&s;ant journey they came once more within view of the Swi&s;s mountains, the &s;ight of which revived a thou&s;and intere&s;ting re|collections in the mind of Adeline. She re|membred the circum&s;tances and the &s;en&s;ati|ons under which &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een them&mdash;when an orphan, flying from per&s;ecution to &s;eek &s;helter among &s;trangers, and lo&s;t to the only per&s;on on earth whom &s;he loved&mdash;&s;he remembered this, and the contra&s;t of the pre&s;ent moment &s;truck with all its force upon her heart.</P>
<P>The countenance of Clara brightened into &s;miles of the mo&s;t animated delight as &s;he drew near the beloved &s;cenes of her infant plea&s;ures; and Theodore, often looking from the windows, caught with patriotic en|thu&s;ia&s;m the magnificent and changing &s;cene|ry which the receding mountains &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was evening when they approached with|in a few miles of Leloncourt, and the road wind|ing round the foot of a &s;tupendous cragg, pre&s;ented them a full view of the lake, and of the peaceful dwelling of La Luc. An ex|clamation of joy from the whole party an|nounced the di&s;covery, and the glance of plea&s;ure was reflected from every eye. The &s;un's la&s;t light gleamed upon the waters that repo&s;ed in <Q REND="inline">"chry&s;tal purity"</Q> below, mel|lowed
<PB N="332" REF="331">
every feature of the land&s;cape, and touched with purple &s;plendour the clouds that rolled along the mountain tops.</P>
<P>La Luc welcomed his family to his happy home, and &s;ent up a &s;ilent thank&s;giving that he was permitted thus to return to it. Ade|line continued to gaze upon each well-known object, and again reflecting on the vici&s;&s;itudes of grief and joy, and the &s;urpri&s;ing change of fortune which &s;he had experienced &s;ince la&s;t &s;he &s;aw them, her heart dilated with gra|titude and complacent delight. She looked at Theodore, whom in the&s;e very &s;cenes &s;he had lamented as lo&s;t to her for ever; who when found again, was about to be torn from her by an ignominious death, but who now &s;at by her &s;ide her &s;ecure and happy hu&s;|band, the pride of his family and her&s;elf; and while the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart flowed in tears from her eyes, a &s;mile of ineffable tenderne&s;s told him all &s;he felt. He gently pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and an&s;wered her with a look of love.</P>
<P>Peter, who now rode up to the carriage with a face full of joy and of importance, interrupted a cour&s;e of &s;entiment which was become almo&s;t too intere&s;ting. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear ma&s;ter!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"welcome home again. Here is the village, God ble&s;s it! It is worth a million &s;uch places as Paris. Thank St. Jacques, we are all come &s;afe back again!"</Q></P>
<P>This effu&s;ion of hone&s;t Peter's joy was received and an&s;wered with the kindne&s;s it de&s;erved. As they drew near the lake mu&s;ic &s;ounded over the water, and they pre&s;ently &s;aw a large party of the villagers a&s;&s;embled on a green &s;pot that &s;loped to the very margin of the waves, and dancing in

all their holiday finery. It was the evening of a fe&s;tival. The elder pea&s;ants &s;at under the &s;hade of the trees that crowned this little eminence, eating milk and fruits, and watching their &s;ons and daughters fri&s;k it away to the &s;prightly notes of the tabor and pipe, which was joined by the &s;ofter tones of a mandolin.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was highly intere&s;ting, and what added to its picture&s;que beauty was a groupe of cattle that &s;tood, &s;ome on the brink, &s;ome half in the water, and others repo&s;ing on the green bank, while &s;everal pea&s;ant girls, dre&s;&s;ed in the neat &s;implicity of their country, were di&s;pen&s;ing the milky fea&s;t. Peter now rode on fir&s;t, and a crowd &s;oon collected round him, who learning that their beloved ma&s;ter was at hand, went forth to meet and welcome him Their warm and hone&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of joy diffu&s;ed an exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction over the heart of the good La Luc, who met them with the kindne&s;s of a father, and who could &s;carcely forbear &s;hed|ding tears to this te&s;timony of their attach|ment When the younger part of the pea|&s;ants heard the news of his arrival, the ge|neral joy was &s;uch, that, led by the tabor and pipe, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y danced before his carriage to the chateau, where they again welcomed him and his family with the enlivening &s;trains of mu&s;ic. At the gate of the chate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">u they were receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d by Madame La Luc, and a happier party never met.</P>
<P>As the evening was uncommonly mild and beautiful, &s;upper was &s;pread in the gar|den. When the repa&s;t was over, Clara, who&s;e heart was all glee, propo&s;ed a dance by moonlight <Q REND="inline">"It will be delicious,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"the moon-beams are already dancing on the waters. See what a &s;tream

of radiance they throw acro&s;s the lake, and, how they &s;parkle round that little promontory on the left. The fre&s;hne&s;s of the hour too invites to dancing."</Q></P>
<P>They all agreed to the propo&s;al.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And let the good people who have &s;o heartily welcomed us home be called in too,"</Q> &s;aid La Luc: <Q REND="inline">"they &s;hall <HI>all</HI> par|take our happine&s;s. There is devotion in making others happy, and gratitude ought to make us devout. Peter, bring more wine, and &s;et &s;ome tables under the trees."</Q> Peter flew, and, while chairs and tables were placing, Clara ran for her favourite lute, the lute which had formerly afforded her &s;uch delight, and which Adeline had often touched with a melancholy expre&s;&s;ion. Clara's light hand now ran over the chorus, and drew forth tones of tender &s;weetne&s;s, her voice accom|panying the following

<P>Peter, who could not move in a &s;ober &s;tep, had already &s;pread refre&s;hments under the trees, and in a &s;hort time the lawn was encircled with pea&s;antry. The rural pipe and tabor were placed, at Clara's reque&s;t, under the &s;hade of her beloved acacias on the

<P>So much was every heart rou&s;ed to glad|ne&s;s, that the morning dawn began to peep upon the &s;cene of their fe&s;tivity, when every cottager returned to his home ble&s;&s;ing the benevolence of La Luc.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome weeks with La Luc, M. Verneuil bought a chateau in the vil|lage of Leloncourt, and as it was the only one not already occupied, Theodore look|ed out for a re&s;idence in the neighbourhood. At the di&s;tance of a few leagues, on the beautiful banks of the lake of Geneva, where the waters retire into a &s;mall bay, he pur|cha&s;ed a villa. The Chateau was charac|terized by an air of &s;implicity and ta&s;te, ra|ther than of magnificence, which however was the chief treat in the &s;urrounding &s;cene. The chateau was almo&s;t encircled with woods, which forming a grand amphitheatre &s;wept, down to the water's edge, and abounded with wild and romantic walks. Here nature was &s;uffered to &s;port in all her beautiful luxu|riance, except where here, and there, the hand of art formed the foliage to admit a view of the blue waters of the lake, with the white &s;ail that glided by, or of the di&s;tant moun|tains. In front of the chateau the woods opened to a lawn, and the eye was &s;uffered

to wander over the lake, who&s;e bo&s;om pre|&s;ented an ever-moving picture, while its va|ried margin &s;prinkled with villas, woods, and towns, and crowned beyond with the &s;nowy and &s;ublime alps, ri&s;ing point behind point in awful confu&s;ion, exhibited a &s;cene|ry of almo&s;t unequalled magnificence.</P>
<P>Here contemning the &s;plendour of fal&s;e happine&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the pure and rati|onal delights of a love refined into the mo&s;t tender friend&s;hip, &s;urrounded by the friends &s;o dear to them, and vi&s;ited by a &s;elect and enlightened &s;ociety&mdash;here, in the very bo|&s;om of felicity, lived Theodore and Adeline La Luc.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of Louis De la Motte yielded at length to the powers of ab&s;ence and nece&s;|&s;ity. He &s;till loved Adeline, but it was with the placid tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip, and when at the earne&s;t invitation of Theodore, he vi&s;i|ted the villa, he beheld their happine&s;s with a &s;atisfaction unalloyed by any emotions of envy. He afterwards married a lady of &s;ome fortune at Geneva, and re&s;igning his com|mi&s;&s;ion in the French &s;ervice, &s;ettled on the borders of the lake, and increa&s;ed the &s;oci|al delights of Theodore and Adeline.</P>
<P>Their formal lives afforded an example of trials well endured&mdash;and their pre&s;ent, of virtues greatly rewarded; and this reward they continued to de&s;erve&mdash;for not to them|&s;elves was their happine&s;s contracted, but diffu&s;ed to all who came within the &s;phere of their influence. The indigent and unhappy rejoiced in their benevolence, the virtuous and enlightened in their friend&s;hip, and their children in parents who&s;e example im|pre&s;&s;ed upon their hearts the precepts offered to their under&s;tandings.</P>
