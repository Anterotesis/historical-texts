<P>AMONG all the u&s;eful and in&s;tructive Books written for the multitude, there has been none calculated to give that ne|ce&s;&s;ary information to Strangers coming to re&s;ide in London, which they are always in want of, nor any pointing out tho&s;e ea&s;y and &s;alutary remedies which the inhabitants of the metropolis may have recour&s;e to, to protect them from the arts and villainies of tho&s;e who prey upon the ignorant and incautious. Impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of the utility of &s;uch a work, the author of the &s;ub&s;equent pages has given them to the world, and flatters him&s;elf he has omitted nothing nece&s;|&s;ary to be known, to &s;ecure the individual in tranquillity and the peaceable enjoyment of his home, and put him in a me|thod of conducting his dome&s;tic concerns with wi&s;dom and oeconomy.</P>
<P>If the reader is de&s;irous of hauing a Compendium of all the laws that re&s;pect, him as a dome&s;tic man, a gentleman, and a member of &s;ociety, and lead him to avoid the penalties he is liable to, I will refer him to a work lately publi&s;hed, called <HI>THE COUNTRY LAWYER,</HI> where he will find every &s;ubject in which he has any intere&s;t fully treated of, and on the be&s;t authorities: the particulars of this work he will find in an adverti&s;ement at the end.</P>

<HEAD>HOUSES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HOUSES and lodgings in London are let either furni&s;hed or unfurni&s;hed, and their prices are according to their &s;ize, their &s;ituation, and their man|ner of fitting up. In the central parts of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;uch as the neighbourhood of St. James's, Charing-Cro&s;s, the &s;quares, Covent-Garden, the thea|tres, St. Paul's Church-yard, Cheap&s;ide, the Royal Ex|change, &amp;c. they are high rented; in more di&s;tant parts they are cheaper, and in by-&s;treets, courts, lanes, alleys, and &s;uch ob&s;cure places, cheaper &s;till.</P>
<P>A private hou&s;e 24 feet in front, and about &s;eventy deep, two or three rooms on a floor, unfurni&s;hed, in the be&s;t &s;treets, will let from 100 guineas a-year to 150; &s;uch a hou&s;e, in other places, may be had from 80 to 100 guineas: unfurni&s;hed lodgings in &s;uch hou&s;es are &s;eldom to be met with.</P>
<P>In le&s;s central places, but in good &s;treets, unfurni&s;h|ed hou&s;es of twenty feet in front, two rooms and a light clo&s;et on a floor, may be had for &s;ixty or &s;eventy guineas a-year; and hou&s;es of eighteen feet in front for forty or thirty guineas, according to the &s;ituation and conveniencies. Unfurni&s;hed lodgings in &s;uch hou&s;es let proportionably. The fir&s;t floor generally goes at half the net rent of the hou&s;e without taxes; the parlour floor, or &s;econd floor, at one fourth.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="22">2. Hou&s;es about twenty-one feet in front will let from four guineas a week furni&s;hed to eight guineas, according to the &s;ea&s;on of the year and the time they are engaged for. The deare&s;t &s;ea&s;on is from Chri&s;tmas to June, when families are in town and the parliament &s;itting; the cheape&s;t, when families are out of town, and the parliament prorogued. In the winter &s;ea&s;on, &s;uch a hou&s;e as I have mentioned, taken for four or five months, may po&s;&s;ibly be had for &s;even guineas a-week. Thus taken, the tenant pays no taxes, the goods are delivered on inventory, and whatever is de&s;troyed is paid for. Furni&s;hed lodgings, that is, the fir&s;t floor with a &s;ervant's room, &amp;c. in &s;uch a hou&s;e, will let for from two guineas a-week to three and a half, in pro|portion to the goodne&s;s of the furniture, the conveni|encies wanted, the trouble given, the time they are engaged for, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>Hou&s;es of fifty guineas a-year rent will let furni&s;hed for from two guineas weekly to five, and the fir&s;t floor furni&s;hed will let for, from one guinea a week to two guineas; &s;econd floors two thirds of the rent of fir&s;t floors, and parlour floors at the price of &s;econd floors.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is generally e&s;timated, that in lodging-hou&s;es the rent of the fir&s;t floor furni&s;hed, with other conve|niencies, &s;uch as kitchen, cellars, garret, &amp;c. &s;hall pay the rent and taxes of the whole hou&s;e unfurni&s;hed.</P>
<P N="4">4. Shops, when let &s;eparate, will fetch from 20 l. a-year to 60 l. free of taxes, according to their &s;ize, &s;itu|ation, trade of the &s;treet, and &s;hew of window.</P>
<P N="5">5. Landlords have now got into a method of making tenants pay guineas for rent in&s;tead of pounds, and al&s;o land-tax and repairs; but all the&s;e outgoings &s;hould be con&s;idered when the agreement is made, as well as the taxes on the hou&s;e, for in &s;ome pari&s;hes the poor-rates and land-tax are lower than in others. Per&s;ons who have money may often get the remnant of a lea&s;e cheap, provided they will pay down a certain &s;um of money for &s;uch lea&s;e; for there are always di&s;tre&s;&s;ed hou&s;e-keepers in London, trying to procure money by every po&s;&s;ible means; for which rea&s;on, &s;uch as pur|cha&s;e a lea&s;e &s;hould examine the covenants of that lea&s;e, and the &s;tate of the building, and particularly take care
<PB N="3" REF="23">
that the rent and taxes are paid up to the time they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and al&s;o the ground-rent, by &s;ee|ing the receipts; otherwi&s;e the tenant may have the arrears of &s;uch rent or taxes to pay, and the &s;eller of the lea&s;e may not be found, or, if found, not able to repay.</P>
<P N="6">6. The general conditions of a lea&s;e are, to leave &s;uch fixtures at the end of the term as are given in with the lea&s;e on &s;chedule, and to leave it in &s;uch a &s;tate as it was in when taken, the wear from time only excepted; to pay the rent half-yearly, under a forfei|ture of the lea&s;e, but with a liberty of a&s;&s;igning it dur|ing the term.</P>
<P N="7">7. If a tenant purcha&s;es or takes a lea&s;e of another tenant, during its term, by a&s;&s;ignment, he is no longer bound for the rent than whil&s;t it is in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; he may a&s;&s;ign it to another, and, this done, is no longer an&s;werable for the rent; but the fir&s;t tenant, a&s;&s;igning it without the con&s;ent of his landlord, is held bound for the rent during the whole term, if the occupier does not pay it.</P>

In purcha&s;ing a lea&s;e of a tenant, it is often ex|pected that the purcha&s;er &s;hould al&s;o buy the fixtures at a fair apprai&s;ement; in doing this, he &s;hould exa|mine the lea&s;e, and &s;ee that he does not give money for tho&s;e fixtures which belong to the hou&s;e; for land|lords will often fit up a hou&s;e with every nece&s;&s;ary fix|ture, and put the tenant to no expence in this matter. But if the fixtures have been put up by the tenant, he has a liberty to remove or &s;ell all &s;uch as are not fixed to the freehold.</P>
<P>Fixtures removeable are locks, bells, ci&s;terns, grates fixed, coppers, dre&s;&s;ers, &s;helves, counters, &amp;c. Paper pa&s;ted to the wall, buildings erected, new windows, chimney-pieces, &amp;c. or things to beautify the hou&s;e, &amp;c. and fixed to the freehold, mu&s;t go with the hou&s;e, at the end of the term, and cannot be removed.</P>
<P>When goods or fixtures are apprai&s;ed, the &s;eller and the buyer each appoints one apprai&s;er, and the price is fixed between them; if they cannot agree, a third is called in by the other two, and his deci&s;ion is final.&mdash; If &s;ix or eight hours is taken up in this bu&s;ine&s;s, each apprai&s;er expects a guinea for his trouble; if a few fix|tures only are to be apprai&s;ed, the apprai&s;er will expect only half-a-guinea. However, if you employ him in removing your furniture, repairing it, &amp;c. and you make a prior agreement with him, he will probably not charge you for the apprai&s;ing of a few fixtures. Be careful to have an hone&s;t man for an apprai&s;er, for his voice has been known to have been bought over on the other &s;ide. When goods are apprai&s;ed to a buyer, a greater value is put upon them than they would fetch at a &s;ale; and if immediately &s;old, they would not fetch the apprai&s;ed price by thirty per|cent.</P>
<P N="10">10. In taking a hou&s;e of its owner, take care that it is in thorough repair, and give a rent accordingly.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is very dangerous to take unfurni&s;hed lodg|ings in London; for &s;hould the tenant of the hou&s;e not pay his rent, your goods will be liable to be &s;eized for it; &s;o will your carriage and hor&s;es &s;tanding at livery, for the rent of the &s;tables, if that rent is in arrear.&mdash; To avoid this, enquire into the circum&s;tances of the

hou&s;e-keeper, and if you cannot get the landlord of the hou&s;e to give you an agreement in writing, that he will not &s;eize your goods for any arrears that may become due by his tenant, a&s;k to &s;ee the landlord's receipt for the la&s;t half-year, before you pay your own rent.</P>
<P N="12">12. Such hou&s;e-keepers who have trouble&s;ome lodg|ers, may remove them, if they will not quit otherwi&s;e, by rai&s;ing the rent weekly upon them; and if they re|fu&s;e to pay, &s;uing them for the &s;ame; if the lodgings are furni&s;hed, and they do not pay, an opportunity may be taken, when the lodger and all per&s;ons be|longing to him are out of the apartments, to lock the door, and keep him from re-entering; if any thing is owing, any effects of the lodger may be detained.</P>
<P N="13">13. If a tenant of an unfurni&s;hed hou&s;e gives notice to his landlord to quit, and does not quit at the time given in &s;uch notice; or if he will not quit the pre|mi&s;es on a legal notice from his landlord, but holds po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion beyond his term, if the landlord has ac|quainted him in writing that he expects double rent for his &s;o doing, he is obliged to pay double the rent fir&s;t agreed on. 11 Geo. 2. c. 19. &s;. 18. 4 Geo. 2. c. 28. &s;. 1.</P>
<P>If a tenant cannot be removed by any of the&s;e means, he mu&s;t be ejected out by a cour&s;e of law.</P>
<P>Notice of warning mu&s;t be in writing, directed to the tenant.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is a late determination of the courts, that if it be nece&s;&s;ary to give a tenant at will half-a-year's notice to quit, the &s;aid notice mu&s;t be given half-a-year be|fore the expiration of his year; that is to &s;ay, his year and the notice mu&s;t expire at the &s;ame time; for if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enant enters upon another year, he may keep po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion the whole of that year, and no ejectment to put him out before will &s;tand good.</P>

<P N="9">9 As an addition to the expence of in&s;urance, go|vernment has laid a tax of 1 s. 6 d. on every 100 l. in&s;ured, which mu&s;t be paid at the time you pay your in&s;urance, which is always a year in advance.</P>

If in&s;uring as above, you have lo&s;t 100 l. of cloaths, they will pay no more than 50 l. the &s;um in&s;ured, and the &s;ame in other articles.

<HEAD>Cautions again&s;t Fire.</HEAD>
<P N="13">13. To guard again&s;t fire, every ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of a family &s;hould be particularly attentive, that &s;er|vants put every fire out before they go to bed, and that they put out the candles in their own room; for if a fire does not begin in your own hou&s;e, as watchmen are always about to give notice, there is &s;ufficient time to e&s;cape. But if families &s;hould be &s;o unfortunate as to be &s;urpri&s;ed by fire, and cannot e&s;cape at the door, they &s;hould by all means endeavour to be cool, and not be too much alarmed&mdash;fear overcomes rea&s;on, and will prevent &s;tudying our &s;afety. If there be no way out at the top of the hou&s;e; from the fir&s;t floor win|dows, or even from the &s;econd, a per&s;on might e&s;cape by tying the blankets and &s;heets together, fa&s;tening one end to a chair, with the window half down, and throwing the other end out, and lowering him&s;elf down by the blankets, &amp;c. the window will prevent the chair following you.</P>
<P N="14">14. The law enjoins, that the pari&s;h-officers &s;hall pay as a reward to the turn-cock, who&s;e water fir&s;t reaches the place where any fire breaks out, a &s;um not exceeding ten &s;hillings; to the fir&s;t engine brought complete, a &s;um not exceeding thirty &s;hillings; to the &s;econd a &s;um not exceeding twenty &s;hillings; and to the third a &s;um not exceeding ten &s;hillings: and to make per&s;ons careful of fire, whenever a chimney takes fire, and the hou&s;e is not burnt, or wherever any mi&s;|chief is done to a hou&s;e by fire beginning in a chim|ney, and the pari&s;h-officers pay the rewards as above, the tenant or lodger, who&s;e chimney is thus &s;et on fire, &s;hall re-pay the church-wardens the &s;aid &s;ums, or &s;uch part of them as a ju&s;tice &s;hall direct, if the matter is referred to him. 14 Geo. 3. c. 78.</P>
<P N="15">15. But as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t fires, every pa|ri&s;h is furni&s;hed with long ladders: the&s;e are kept at certain places, and every family &s;hould know where they are kept, and write it down, and fix the writing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ome con&s;picuous part of the hou&s;e, as al&s;o in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tuation the fire-plugs are; by doing this, people can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lways have recour&s;e to them.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="20" REF="40">16. If families have any thing to pre&s;erve more than ordinary; for example, &s;hop-books, books of account, writings, bank-notes, ca&s;h, &amp;c. as the&s;e things take but little room, it would be advi&s;eable for tho&s;e who have no other &s;ecure place, to put them every night into a bag, and place them in their chamber by their cloaths; they can thus be readily carried off.</P>
<P N="17">17. Some families have &s;tone-clo&s;ets, others have iron che&s;ts, but the above method would be almo&s;t equally as &s;ecure.</P>
<P N="18">18. Trade&s;men would do well to keep duplicates of their books, and lodge one &s;et in the hou&s;e of a friend; the occurrences of a week might be tran&s;cribed at the week's end.</P>
<P N="19">19. Tho&s;e who have bank-notes &s;hould always en|ter the number, date and &s;um of each note, in a book, as &s;oon as received, in which ca&s;e, if de&s;troyed, on giving the bank &s;ecurity to re-pay the money, in ca&s;e the note ever appears again&s;t them, they will give the lo&s;er the ca&s;h. If they receive them of bankers, and can remember where they received them, and on who&s;e account, &s;uch bankers will furni&s;h them with the particulars, as they always enter them in their books.</P>
<P N="20">20. If a neighbouring hou&s;e is on fire, pre&s;erve your temper, be cool and wary; don't be in ha&s;te to open your doors and let in the rabble, be they as impatient as they may; for in fires, thieves are always ready to plunder a hou&s;e, and you may lo&s;e more that way than any other. The in&s;urance-offices always retain in their &s;ervice a number of men to attend at fires; the&s;e may be known by their dre&s;s and badge; and if you admit any into your hou&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in removing your property, let the&s;e be the only people. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e &s;hould &s;tand at the door him&s;elf for that purpo&s;e, and the goods, as removed, &s;hould be carried to the hou&s;e of &s;ome friend in the neighbourhood, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet.</P>
<P N="21">21. The taxes of a hou&s;e in London are nearly half the rent, and are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. Land-tax, a tax on the ground, paid by the te|nant, half-yearly, but generally allowed by the land|lord in the rent, if no agreement to the contrary.&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="41" MS="y">
This is generally four &s;hillings in the pound, but in &s;ome pari&s;hes le&s;s than others.</P>
<P N="2">2. A hou&s;e-tax paid to Government, by the tenant, of &s;ix-pence, nine-pence, or one &s;hilling in the pound according to the rent. The rent, in this tax, is rated to the full. See <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the hou&s;e has a retail-&s;hop belonging to it, it pays an additional tax of from four &s;hillings to two &s;hillings in the pound, according to the rent of the hou&s;e. This to be paid al&s;o by the tenant. See <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> 16.</P>
<P N="4">4. The poor's-rate is another tax, but a parochial one, paid by the tenant to the over&s;eers of the pari&s;h, for the maintenance of the poor. This is collected every half-year, and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is from one to &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, or more, according to the num|ber of poor in the pari&s;h. This a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is made by the pari&s;h officers, and ratified by a bench of ju&s;tices. The book, with this ratification, and the &s;ums each hou&s;e-keeper is to pay, is brought round to every hou&s;e, when the money is collected, and each inhabi|tant may &s;ee how much others pay, then or at any other time, on paying &s;ix-pence or a &s;hilling. The rent of each hou&s;e is generally e&s;timated in the pari&s;h-book at two-thirds of the real rent paid; and if any per&s;on finds that he pays more in proportion than the re&s;t of the pari&s;h, he may obtain redre&s;s, by an appli|cation to the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, at a very little expence.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on occupying any hou&s;e, &amp;c. out of which any other per&s;on a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed has removed, or which, at the making the rate was empty, every per&s;on &s;o removing, and the per&s;on &s;o coming into and occupying the &s;ame, &s;hall pay to &s;uch rate in proportion to the time he oc|cupied the &s;ame.

<P>Gla&s;s-doors, and lights over doors, are here con&s;i|dered as windows.</P>
<P N="7">7. The next tax is the church-wardens rate, for re|pairing the church. The county-rate is generally col|lected with it. This is only collected occa&s;ionally, and may be from three-pence in the pound to two or three &s;hillings, according to the exigencies required.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another rate or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is the paving-tax, for repairing, cleaning, and lighting the &s;treets. This is one &s;hilling and &s;ix-pence in the pound, of two-thirds of the rent or value.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another is for watching them, but this is a trifle.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is a further call on every hou&s;eholder for Ea&s;ter-offerings, for the rector or vicar of the pari&s;h; this is four-pence a-head for every one in each family capable of receiving the &s;acrament, paid once a year, at Ea&s;ter. But this &s;eldom is collected; it is generally le&s;t to each family to give what they plea&s;e; but it is always expected that they give &s;omething; perhaps a few &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Once or twice a year the church-wardens generally bring round a book, to make a collection for the lectu|rer or afternoon preacher. At this time a hou&s;e|keeper generally gives a few &s;hillings, but this is op|tional.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="44">In &s;ome pari&s;hes, twenty or thirty &s;hillings a year, more or le&s;s, are paid by hou&s;e-keepers, in proportion to their rent, in lieu of tithes.</P>
<P N="11">11. A further expence to the inhabitants is the river water, with which each hou&s;e is &s;erved, from about twenty-four to thirty &s;hillings a year, according to the time of &s;erving, whether every day or three times a week.</P>
<P N="1">1. The London-bridge water-works &s;upply the city, and the greate&s;t part of its liberties, with Thames wa|ter, at the rate of from twenty-four to thirty &s;hillings (paid half-yearly) according to the di&s;tance from Lon|don-bridge. The pipes of this Company &s;pread all over the city to Tower-hill, Snow-hill, Shore-ditch, and St. Dun&s;tan's-church, Fleet-&s;treet. Office at Lon|don-bridge.</P>
<P N="2">2. The York-building water-works, (office in Vil|liers-&s;treet, attendance from three in the afternoon till &s;even) &s;upplies We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the we&s;t end of the town, as far as Holborn, with Thames water, and will convey the water, if de&s;ired, to the upper-&s;tories of a hou&s;e, the &s;econd or third &s;tory, according to their &s;ituation. The higher the hou&s;e &s;tands from the water &s;ide, the le&s;s height can they convey the water. The prices of the water is the &s;ame with the London-bridge water-works; only, if the water is to be conveyed to the &s;econd or third &s;tory, more money is paid annu|ally, from thirty &s;hillings to five pounds. The Thames water is reckoned &s;ofter than that of the new river.&mdash; If a fire happens in the night, application for water from this Company, and that of London-bridge, mu&s;t be made at the re&s;pective offices, and it will be &s;ome time, half an hour or more, before they can get their engines to work.</P>
<P N="3">3. The New-River Company (office in Dor&s;et-&s;treet, Fleet-&s;treet) &s;upplies all London on the north &s;ide of the Thames, from Mile-end turnpike to Hyde-park corner, with water brought twenty miles from London, to a re&s;ervoir at I&s;lington. The terms of this Company are rather higher than tho&s;e of other water-companies, but the water is generally clearer and better. They &s;erve families from twenty-four &s;hillings a year to five
<PB N="25" REF="45">
pounds, according to the quantity of water they re|quire, which is &s;ettled by the collector of the di&s;trict, who&s;e name may be known, by applying at the office, in Dor&s;et-&s;treet. This collector al&s;o will furni&s;h fa|milies with the names of the turn-cocks in his di&s;trict, printed on paper, to whom application is to be made in ca&s;es of fire; and in the collector's receipts will be found the place to apply to, in want of water and o|ther complaints. This Company conveys the water to upper &s;tories of hou&s;es, without any additional ex|pence than the lead pipes, which are the property of, and mu&s;t be fixed by, the tenant; the nearer a hou&s;e &s;tands to the Thames &s;ide, that is, the lower it is from the re&s;ervoirs, the higher in the hou&s;es the water can be conveyed. In the New River Water-works, the water runs from an eminence; in the London-bridge and York Company, it is forced up by fire; of cour&s;e, the higher it is conveyed, the more money annually is required.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are other water-works, tho&s;e of Chel&s;ea, Hamp&s;tead, Bay&s;water, Shadwell, Lambeth, &amp;c. that &s;upply other parts of the town, and the Borough of Southwark, with &s;oft water, and on nearly the &s;ame terms. Thrale's water-works, that &s;upply part of Southwark, &s;erve &s;o low as 20 s. a-year.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lead pipes from the main, that is, from the middle of the &s;treet, are con&s;idered as belonging to the hou&s;e, and mu&s;t be paid for, and kept in repair by the tenant; other repairs and expences are paid by the &s;e|veral companies.</P>
<P N="6">6. Attendance is always given at the re&s;pective offi|ces from morning till night, and complaints immediate|ly redre&s;&s;ed. It is proper to &s;end to the&s;e offices im|mediately on a fire breaking out, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that &s;upply the Thames water.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is advi&s;eable for every hou&s;e-keeper, on fir&s;t coming to London, to apply to the offices for the names of the turn-cocks, and where they live; and al|&s;o to fire-offices, for the places where the fire-engines are; al&s;o to the ve&s;try-clerks of the different pari&s;h|es, for the places where the ladders are kept, and from year to year, who are the con&s;tables and other
<PB N="26" REF="46">
pari&s;h-officers, and to write the&s;e down and &s;tick them up in the kitchen, or other part of the hou&s;e, that the earlie&s;t application, in ca&s;e of fire, may be made for every nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="8">8. In fro&s;ty weather, to &s;ecure water to the hou&s;e is the care and bu&s;ine&s;s of the tenant. For this pur|po&s;e, fre&s;h hor&s;e-dung &s;hould be laid over the pave|ment under which the lead pipes pa&s;s, and &s;ome &s;hould be wound round the pipe as it cro&s;&s;es the area. Dung can be had at any of the &s;tables for a trifle, and the ex|pence of fetching it in a cart is not much.</P>

<HEAD>BAKERS, BREAD AND MILK.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. EVERY peck loaf &s;hall weigh 17 lb. 6 oz. averdupois weight; every half peck 8 lb. 11 oz. and every quartern loaf 4 lb. 5 oz. and an half; to be weighed within twenty-four hours after baking or being &s;old, under the penalty of from 1 s. to 5 s. for every ounce deficient, at the di&s;cretion of the magi&s;|trate, the bread to be taken and weighed in his pre|&s;ence; for every deficiency of weight under one ounce, the penalty is from 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. 31 Geo. 2. c. 39. 3 Geo. 3. c. 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bread made for &s;ale &s;hall be fairly marked; wheaten-bread with a large Roman W, and hou&s;ehold-bread with an H, to a&s;certain under what denomina|tion it was made, under a penalty not exceeding 20 s. nor under 5 s. Ibid.</P>
<P N="3">3. Any baker or other per&s;on demanding or taking a higher price for bread, than what the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;et at by the a&s;&s;ize, or refu&s;ing to &s;ell to any per&s;on any of the &s;orts allowed or ordered to be made; when he &s;hall have more than is nece&s;&s;ary for the immediate u&s;e of his family or cu&s;tomers, forfeits not exceeding 40 s. nor le&s;s than 10 s.

<P N="4">4. If a certain weight of wheaten-bread co&s;ts 8 d. the &s;ame weight of &s;tandard wheaten (to be marked S. W.) &s;hall be &s;old for 7 d. and the &s;ame weight of
<PB N="27" REF="47">
hou&s;ehold-bread &s;hall be &s;old for 6 d. on penalty of from 10 s. to 40 s. Ibid.</P>
<P>Bread inferior to wheaten is not to be &s;old at a higher price than hou&s;ehold-bread is &s;et at, on penalty of 20 s. Ibid. Applications to a magi&s;trate.</P>
<P N="5">5. Bakers' men, who carry the bread round to their cu&s;tomers, will &s;ometimes, if families run up a bill, &s;ell a loaf or two by the way, and put the money into their own pockets, telling their ma&s;ters, that they left them at &s;uch hou&s;es. The ma&s;ter, of cour&s;e, charges the cu&s;tomer for bread he never had; and, when the bill comes to be paid, it perhaps occa&s;ions a di&s;pute, and the buyer finds him&s;elf obliged to pay for it after all. To avoid this, the be&s;t method is, never to run a bill with a baker, but pay for the bread as it is left; or, if this be inconvenient, order the bill in every Monday morning, while the occurrences of the week are in the memory: the&s;e bills, examined and filed, will prevent your being cheated. Bakers, like milk-women, will &s;ometimes leave tallies, on which they daily chalk what is left, but a mark is ea&s;ily added, while the &s;ervant is inattentive, which robs you of the price of a loaf, or a pint of milk. The&s;e marks are &s;ometimes made on the door-po&s;t, oftener without the door than within; of cour&s;e an addition can be made unknown to your &s;ervant, as the baker or milk-woman pa&s;&s;es the door; or they may be wholly rubbed out, by wanton boys or others, as is frequently the ca&s;e; and when the &s;core is gone, the baker or milk-woman may charge what they plea&s;e; and as they can &s;ell a loaf or a pint of milk to tho&s;e who pay ready money, and &s;e|crete that money; to conceal this fraud from their ma&s;|ters, they will &s;core it up to their cu&s;tomers on credit.</P>
<P N="6">6. With re&s;pect to milk, though &s;old at 3 d. a quart, it is always mixed with water. There are cows that are driven into the &s;treets, about the we&s;t end of the town, from which you may have your milk, and &s;ee it milked, at 4 d. a quart, but the milk of the&s;e is not very good, as the cows are driven about all the day; yet it is better than what is brought by milk-women.</P>

<HEAD>BUTCHERS AND MEAT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is by no means advi&s;eable to deal with one butcher, unle&s;s you can agree to have all your meat, viz. beef, mutton, veal, lamb and pork, weigh|ed in, at one and the &s;ame price, all the year round; which &s;ome butchers will do at 5 d. a pound, and occa&s;ionally give you, at the &s;ame price, a quarter of hou&s;e-lamb. If you enter into &s;uch an agreement, take care to have a bill of the weight always &s;ent home with the meat, and order it to be weighed by your own people.</P>
<P>If you make no &s;uch agreement, and deal regularly with one butcher, you will frequently be charged for a joint you never had; and for half a pound, or a quarter of a pound more than the joint weighs: and you will always pay a halfpenny, or a farthing more per pound, than was you to go to market and cheapen it your&s;elf. In buying a joint at market, of &s;even pounds and an half, you may often deduct the half pound, but when &s;ent home by a butcher who credits you, never. This conduct in a family will occa&s;ion a great &s;aving at the year's end. If you pay your butcher but once a quarter, be &s;ure to have a bill of the weight and price &s;ent in with your meat, and a re|gular bill of the week's meat every Monday morning. In this ca&s;e you will &s;ee what you are about, and not be liable to be impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P N="2">2. Good meat &s;hould not look lean, dry, or &s;hrivel|led; the fle&s;hy part &s;hould be of a bright red, and the fat of a clear white. When the fle&s;h looks pale, and the fat yellow, the meat is not good. Cow beef is worth a penny a pound le&s;s than ox beef, except it be the meat of a maiden hei&s;er. In a buttock you may know it by the udder.</P>
<P N="3">3. The average price of beef is from 4d. a pound to 5d. The prime boiling parts are the rump, buttock edge-bone, bri&s;kit, thick and thin flank; roa&s;ting pie|ces, the &s;urloin and ribs.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="49">Butchers make a difference in price between pieces of beef to roa&s;t and boil; if you take a piece of each, they will &s;ell prime beef for 4d. halfpenny; if a boil|ling piece alone 4d. if roa&s;ting alone 5d.</P>
<P>If you want rump-&s;teaks in any quantity, it is cheap|er to give 7d. a pound without bone than 4d. halfpenny for the whole rump. A buttock is the cheape&s;t joint, as it is free from bone; for if you wi&s;h it, the butcher will &s;ell it you without the marrow-bone, which is worth its weight for the marrow.</P>
<P>In buying a buttock of beef, be careful you do not buy the mou&s;e-buttock for the prime one. The differ|ence is ea&s;ily known; the prime buttock is fir&s;t cut off the leg, and is the thicke&s;t; the mou&s;e-buttock is thin|ner, and cut off the legs between the buttock and the leg bone, is coar&s;e meat, and not worth &s;o much by one penny a pound.</P>
<P>A bullock's tongue will &s;ell from 2s. to 4s. 6d. ac|cording to its &s;ize and goodne&s;s. A good tongue &s;hould look plump, clear and bright, not of a blacki&s;h hue.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fle&s;h of mutton &s;hould be of a bright red, and its fat of a clear white; and unle&s;s it is very fat it is worth little. Ewe mutton is not worth &s;o much as weather by a penny in the pound; mutton five years old, if it can be got, is the mo&s;t delicious; its natural gravy is brown. A leg of ewe mutton may be known by the udder on its &s;kirt. The average price of prime weather mutton is 4d. halfpenny per pound, though it will &s;ell often for 5d. halfpenny.</P>
<P N="5">5. The average price of veal is 6d. though it will often &s;ell for 8d. particularly the fillet. Large veal is &s;eldom good. Veal &s;hould be fat and very white, like rabbit or chicken, not red, or look as if it was much blown up.</P>
<P N="6">6. The average price of gra&s;s lamb is 6d. a pound, that of pig-pork the &s;ame, though pork chops will of|ten &s;ell for 7d. or 8d.</P>
<P>Hou&s;e lamb at Chri&s;tmas is dear, and if fine and &s;at will &s;ell for 7s. 6d. a quarter, the leg 5s. At other times it may be bought &s;o low as 3s. 6d. a quarter.</P>
<P N="7">7. If your butcher &s;ends you any tainted meat, he may be fined, by complaining to a magi&s;trate; but the
<PB N="30" REF="50">
readie&s;t and lea&s;t trouble&s;ome method of redre&s;s, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> put up with a trifling lo&s;s, and deal with &s;uch a butche no more.</P>
<P N="8">8. The be&s;t markets in town are, St. James's, New port, Clare-market, Newgate, Honey-lane, and Leaden hall, for meat; for vegetables, Covent-Garden and Leaden-hall; for fre&s;h butter, Leaden-hall, particular+ly for Epping butter and cream chee&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>POULTRY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. POULTRY of all &s;orts may be purcha&s;ed cheape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the higlers at the &s;everal markets, than at the Poulterer's &s;hops; but of the higlers you mu&s;t take care what you buy: fowls and chickens &s;hould be fat plump and white, particularly white legged. Chicken may be known by their &s;ize, and fowls are young, if they have no &s;purs.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame marks you may judge of turkeys. A large cock-turkey at Chri&s;tmas cannot be bought for le&s;s than 6s. or 7s. at other times 5s.; a hen turkey from 4s. to 5s. 6d. Fat crammed chickens, about ten weeks old, on or about Lady-day, are worth about 3s. 6d. each, and a fine fowl at Mid&s;ummer is worth 3s. 6d. at other times chicken may be bought of higlers for 3s. or 4s. a couple, and fowls at the &s;ame price.</P>
<P>Ducks and gee&s;e &s;hould look white, very plump, and broad over the brea&s;t. A fat goo&s;e, weight about 10 lb. on Michaelmas-day, is worth 5 s. at other times about 3 s. 6 d. A green goo&s;e in May is worth 4 s. The price of ducks is from 3 s. a couple to 5 s. Wild ducks, in fro&s;ty weather, may be bought in Fleet-market for 2 s. 6 d. a couple; at other times they are worth 2 s. each. If they &s;mell fi&s;hy they are of little value; to know this, take one of the pen-feathers from the wing, and put it down the throat; if it &s;mells fi&s;hy in draw|ing it out, the bird will ta&s;te &s;o. Dove-hou&s;e pidge|ons, in May or June, may be bought for 3 s. 6 d. or 4 s. a dozen. In winter time, poulterers will a&s;k 1 s. 6 d. a piece. Larks, in hard weather, may be

At this time they are worth from 7 s. to 10 s. each; at other times they are worth little: the&s;e la&s;t can be bought only of the poulterers, of whom quails al&s;o may be had after harve&s;t, at 2 s. 6d. each. Woodcocks are from 2 s. to 4 s. each, accord|ing to the plenty or &s;carcity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Eggs are from three a groat to eight, according to the time of the year; they are deare&s;t in winter: but &s;uch as wi&s;h for new-laid eggs may frequently get them at the livery-&s;tables, for one penny or three-half|pence each.</P>

<HEAD>FISH.</HEAD>
<P>FISH is generally deare&s;t and be&s;t, when in &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fi&s;h-mongers charge a price for fi&s;h according to their cu&s;tomers; to deal with one man regularly, and pay him once or twice a year, is as bad as dealing with butchers in the &s;ame way. A fi&s;h-monger near the &s;quares will charge 2 s. 6 d. for a mackrell, which may be bought for half the money at Charing-cro&s;s; and for one-third of the money from tho&s;e who cry them about.</P>
<P>To &s;uch as live convenient, Billing&s;gate is the place to buy &s;ea-fi&s;h at, whether you want little or much.&mdash; Market-days there are Mondays, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays; but market-days are the deare&s;t days.&mdash; You may often buy them fre&s;h, and forty per cent. cheaper, on the intermediate days. By purcha&s;ing at Billing&s;gate, you may buy at one-third of the price which fi&s;h-mongers charge, and if you lay out a few &s;hillings, it will pay for a per&s;on to carry them home: fi&s;h-mongers, at this market, purcha&s;e at break of day; and, when the market is not glutted, they will, at tho&s;e times, buy up all the large&s;t fi&s;h, but there is always &s;uf|ficient le&s;t to &s;erve private families.

<P N="3">3. Mackrell, in June and July, are in great plenty, and may be bought at Billing&s;gate by the quarter of a hundred, for 2 d. or 3 d. a piece. Mackrell and her|rings, if fre&s;h, will look bright, their gills red, and their eyes clear. Mackrell are reckoned cheap at 4 d. or 5 d. each.

The be&s;t fre&s;h lump butter, in &s;ummer, may be bought for 9 d. halfpenny or 10 d. a pound; in winter for 11 d. or 12 d.

In buy|ing of this, every hou&s;e-keeper &s;hould plea&s;e his own palate. Though decayed chee&s;e will plea&s;e many pa|lates be&s;t, it may be bought a halfpenny, and &s;ome|times a penny a pound under the price of &s;ound chee&s;e.

In buying of bacon, the Wilt&s;hire is reckoned the be&s;t, and may be bought at capital &s;hops for 6 d. halfpenny or 7 d. a pound, by the flitch: &s;mall bacon, &s;uch as weighs about 40 lb. the &s;litch, is the mo&s;t deli|cate. In buying it, have the flitch cut through, and if the fat looks red, and the &s;kin is thin, it will pro|bably turn out well, and boil firm; but if you make an agreement, the &s;eller will change it, if you di&s;like it.

<P>IN London, charge as rea&s;onably for wa&s;hing, as in the country; and families who put out their linen would do well to employ a laundre&s;s living a little way out of town. Such per&s;ons are to be found, who will &s;end for the linen once a week, and bring it home again; for where there are good conveniencies for drying, the linen mu&s;t certainly be better got up.

<HEAD>SERVANTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the choice of &s;ervants, a hou&s;e-keeper cannot be too particular. London is &s;o much the &s;ink of vice, that the lower cla&s;s of people are very much corrupted. Tho&s;e brought from the country are &s;oon infected with the di&s;&s;olute manners of town-&s;ervants, and become equally bad with them. To expect at|tachment from a &s;ervant is idle, and betrays an igno|rance of the world. Servants will now and then af|fect it, in order to gain the confidence of their em|ployers, and thus forward their own intere&s;t; but, if we &s;uppo&s;e them in our intere&s;t, it is becau&s;e we do not thoroughly know them. Economy in a family, &s;er|vants do not like. The more extravagant a ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s is, the better they live, and the more they can purloin; and &s;hould, what they call, a generous ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s fail in the world, owing to a wa&s;te or an in|attention to dome&s;tic concerns, they will cry to their fellow-&s;ervants, "It is a pity! he was a good-natured generous man!&mdash;Come, let us go look for another place!" This being con&s;idered, we are to expect no|thing from them but a performance of their duty, keep them whil&s;t they do it, and di&s;charge them when they neglect it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t thing, then, is to endeavour to get good ones, if we do not bring them out of the country with us. There are, in different parts of the town, regi&s;ter-offices, or places where &s;ervants of all denominations attend at certain hours, and where a ma&s;ter may &s;ee them, at the expence of one &s;hilling, and hire them; or, by &s;ending a &s;hilling to the keepers of &s;uch offices, and a de&s;cription of the &s;ervant wanted, they will &s;end you one, day after day, till you are &s;uited; but as it is the refu&s;e of &s;ervants in general that apply to the&s;e offices, you mu&s;t not take the recommendation of the office-keeper, who is paid al&s;o by the &s;ervant for pro|curing the place; nor any written character; for &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hings in London are procured from friends, and often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orged; nay &s;ervants of bad character will often go fur|ther,
<PB N="48" REF="68">
they will refer you to per&s;ons &s;eemingly of cre|dit, who perhaps know little of them. It is proper therefore, that the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould apply for the character them&s;elves, make &s;ome enquiry concern|ing the per&s;on they apply to, and a&s;k all tho&s;e que&s;ti|ons they think nece&s;&s;ary. There are few &s;ervant-maids in London, or indeed in the country, but what are whores; it is perhaps an uncharitable &s;uppo&s;ition, but it is neverthele&s;s true. To expect, therefore, to meet with an innocent virtuous girl, is next to impo&s;&s;ible; it is &s;ufficient if &s;he is orderly, and conducts her&s;elf with decorum. If a hou&s;e-keeper cannot get a &s;ervant recommended by a friend, or &s;ome trade&s;man with whom he deals, &s;uch as the baker, butcher, poulterer, green-grocer, tallow-chandler, publican, or the like, I would recommend papers de&s;cribing the &s;ervant want|ed, and where to apply, being &s;ent or left at the chandler's &s;hops in the neighbourhood, which &s;eldom fails of &s;ucce&s;s; others will have recour&s;e to adverti&s;e|ments in the public new&s;papers, an in&s;ertion for which, once, co&s;ts 3 s. 6 d. If this mode is adopted, the be&s;t paper to adverti&s;e in is the <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er</HI> in Fleet-&s;treet, which is taken in by almo&s;t all the publi|cans in London. Such an adverti&s;ement will bring you &s;cores of &s;ervants; and here you mu&s;t be very careful in your choice, and particular as to charac|ter; for an adverti&s;ement will bring with the good a number of di&s;reputable people.</P>
<P N="3">3. The general wages of &s;ervants are as follow:&mdash; Steward, valet, butler, 30 l. a-year; women-cooks, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> l. lady's-maids, from 12 l. to 20 l. inferior women &s;ervants, from 7 l. to 9 l. foot-men 14 l. and a livery: women-&s;ervants to provide their own tea and &s;ugar.&mdash; Board-wages of an upper &s;ervant 10 s. 6 d. a week, with fire and candle, and 7 s. a week to an under-&s;er|vant.</P>
<P N="4">4. They generally agree for a month's wages, or a month's warning, which is a bad method; as there are few &s;ervants, when warning is given, but will be very impertinent and untractable, it is far the be&s;t, when you mean to part with them, to get rid of them at once, be it ever &s;o inconvenient: by enquiry an hone&s;t chair|woman,
<PB N="49" REF="69">
to &s;upply the place of a woman-&s;ervant, may be procured for 1 s. a day. If &s;uch are hired to wa&s;h, their wages are larger: 1 s. 6 d. with tea and a dram twice a day, and &s;trong beer at dinner and &s;up|per; but for this they &s;lave hard, will begin work at two in the morning, and continue it till nine the next evening. If &s;uch a per&s;on is wanted, employ none of your own &s;ervant's recommending, but apply for their character to tho&s;e hou&s;e-keepers who have employed them, and on whom you can better rely.</P>
<P N="5">5. Women cooks, and &s;ervants of all work, when they hire them&s;elves, will endeavour to get the kitch|en-&s;tuff allowed them as a perqui&s;ite; if you would not be robbed, never comply with this; nor allow your coachman the old wheels; for as the one will, to &s;erve her&s;elf, &s;trip your meat of its fat, melt more but|ter than nece&s;&s;ary, and convey the ends of candles, &amp;c. into the grea&s;e-pot, to increa&s;e its weight; &s;o will the other often injure the wheels, if they are likely to la&s;t too long.</P>
<P N="6">6. If you deliver into the cu&s;tody of &s;ervants, plate, china, linen, &amp;c. to keep; and tell them, before wit|ne&s;s, they mu&s;t be re&s;pon&s;ible for it; if they lo&s;e any part of it, the law will oblige them, as far as they are able, to make it good; but not el&s;e: to enable them, therefore, to pay for any thing mi&s;&s;ing, it is advi&s;e|able to keep part of their wages in hand. As they are hired by the year, they &s;hould always be paid one half year under another, re&s;erving half-a-year in hand. As to breaking of china, &amp;c. you cannot compel a &s;ervant to pay for it, unle&s;s it was &s;o agreed on the hiring, or done de&s;ignedly.</P>
<P N="7">7. To avoid di&s;putes re&s;pecting wages, it is prudent to have the agreement in writing, and a receipt for what you pay; for (&s;orry am I to &s;ay it) this cla&s;s of people make as little ceremony of taking a fal&s;e oath, where there is no proof to the contrary, as of telling a lie.</P>
<P>Di&s;putes with &s;ervants, about wages under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 l. and other things, if they cannot amicably be &s;ettled, &s;hould be referred to a neighbouring magi&s;trate, who is autho|ri&s;ed to hear the complaint and redre&s;s it; the expence
<PB N="50" REF="70">
but trifling; but the wages of coachmen, grooms, and the like, magi&s;trates can take no cognizance of.</P>
<P N="8">8. Where &s;ervants are hired for a year, they cannot be put away before the expiration of that term, with|out &s;ome rea&s;onable cau&s;e to be allowed by one ju&s;tice; nor after the end of the term, without a quarter's warn|ing given before witne&s;s; if a ma&s;ter di&s;charges a &s;er|vant otherwi&s;e, he is liable to a penalty of 40 s.&mdash; 5 Eliz. c. 4.</P>
<P>If a &s;ervant refu&s;e to &s;erve his term, he may be com|mitted till he give &s;ecurity to &s;erve the time; or he may be &s;ent to the hou&s;e of correction, and puni&s;hed there as a di&s;orderly per&s;on. 5 Eliz. c. 4. 7 Jac. c. 4.</P>
<P>A yearly &s;ervant is not to be di&s;charged by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, or any other di&s;ability by the act of God; not may his wages for tho&s;e cau&s;es be abated. Dalt. 129. All hiring without &s;tipulation of time is, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, hiring for a year, and the law &s;o con&s;trues it.</P>
<P>Both ma&s;ter and &s;ervant may however part by mu|tual con&s;ent, and then the allowance of the cau&s;e by a ju&s;tice of peace is not nece&s;&s;ary. A ma&s;ter's detaining wages, or not allowing &s;ufficient meat, drink, &amp;c. is good cau&s;e for a &s;ervant's departure; but it mu&s;t be al|lowed by a ju&s;tice. Dalt.</P>
<P>If a &s;ervant, hired for a term, quits his &s;ervice be|fore the end of his term, he lo&s;es all his wages; but if the ma&s;ter puts him away, he &s;hall be paid to the time he &s;erved.</P>
<P>A woman-&s;ervant who marries is obliged to &s;erve out her time; and if both man and wife agree to &s;erve, they mu&s;t perform the agreement. Dalt. 92.</P>
<P>If a &s;ervant be retained for a year, according to the &s;tatute 5 Eliz. c. 4, and the ma&s;ter die within that time, the executor mu&s;t pay the wages; but not &s;o if the retainer was not for a year.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant hired at a month's wages, or a month's warning, cannot quit his place, nor be di&s;charged, a day before the expiration of the month, without the whole month's wages be paid, unle&s;s by the authority of a ju&s;tice, for &s;ome rea&s;onable complaint. If a &s;er|vant, after warning given, is in&s;olent, or refu&s;es to do his duty, a magi&s;trate, on complaint, will commit him
<PB N="51" REF="71">
to pri&s;on, for the time he has to &s;erve; but the ma&s;ter will be ordered to pay him his wages whil&s;t there.</P>
<P N="9">9. If a &s;ervant or workman a&s;&s;ault his ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, or any other having charge over them, he may be bound to his good behaviour, or be committed for a year, or le&s;s, at the di&s;cretion of two magi&s;trates. 5 Eliz. c. 4. &s;. 21.</P>
<P N="10">10. If any &s;ervant &s;hall purloin, or make away with his ma&s;ter's goods, to the value of 40 s. it is felony.&mdash; 12 Ann. c. 7.</P>
<P N="11">11. Should a woman with child procure her&s;elf to be retained with a ma&s;ter for a term, who knows no|thing thereof, this is good cau&s;e to di&s;charge her from her &s;ervice; if &s;he prove with child during her &s;ervice it is the &s;ame; but if he does not di&s;charge her before a magi&s;trate, when he knows of it, and keeps her on, he mu&s;t provide for her till her delivery, and one month after, and then &s;he is to be &s;ent to her place of &s;ettle|ment. Dalt.</P>
<P N="12">12. A &s;ervant &s;etting fire carele&s;sly to a hou&s;e, is liable to pay, on the oath of one witne&s;s, a hundred pounds to the &s;ufferer, or be committed to hard labour for 18 months. 14 Geo. 3. c. 78.</P>

<P N="3">3. The terms of a&s;&s;urance at the <HI>Amicable Society,</HI> Ser|jeant's-inn, Fleet-&s;treet, are as follow:&mdash;</P>
<P>July 25, 1706, Queen Anne incorporated William, then Lord Bi&s;hop of Oxon, Sir Thomas Aleyn, Bart. and others, and every other per&s;on who &s;hould be then after admitted a &s;ub&s;criber, (not exceeding 2000 in the whole) by the name of the Amicable Society, with power to purcha&s;e and alien lands, not exceeding the yearly value of 2000 l. to acquire any goods and chat|tels what&s;oever, to &s;ue, and be &s;ued, and to have a com|mon &s;eal.</P>

<P>Twelve per&s;ons were appointed directors, with power for any &s;even, or more of them, to hold courts; and the major part of them a&s;&s;embled were to manage the affairs of the corporation according to the charter, and to the by-laws to be made by the major part of the members in a general court, which court may not con|&s;i&s;t of le&s;s than twenty members; and for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of directors, twelve members (living within the bills of mortality) were to be cho&s;en yearly, within forty days after Lady-day, to be directors for one year, and until others &s;hould be cho&s;en in their places; and one of the members of the corporation was appointed re|gi&s;ter, to be &s;ucceeded, from time to time, by another member.</P>

<PB N="70" REF="90">

<P>No per&s;on can be admitted a member under the age of twelve, or above the age of forty-five years, (except in exchange) and per&s;ons above the age of forty-three are required to procure authentic certificates of their ages.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons in London, or within fifteen miles thereof, mu&s;t appear before a court of directors, and there vo|luntarily make oath, "That he or &s;he is in a good &s;tate of health, and hath no di&s;temper, which, accord|ing to the be&s;t of his or her knowledge, judgement or belief, may tend to the &s;hortening of his or her days."</P>
<P>Per&s;ons living above fifteen miles from London, and not appearing before a court of directors, may be ad|mitted members (after they are upon enquiry other|wi&s;e approved of) by certificates and affidavits.</P>
<P>Not more than three numbers or &s;hares can be had upon any one life.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on, on admi&s;&s;ion, is to pay a premium of 7 l. 10 s. for each number or &s;hare, together with 7 s. 6 d. for the policy.</P>
<P>A dividend of 1 l. 4 s. is allowed to each member, out of the profits of the corporation, whereby the char|ter payment of 6 l. 4 s. is reduced to 5 l. per annum, which 5 l. is to be paid quarterly, under certain pe|nalties for every &s;hare.</P>
<P>The death of every member mu&s;t be proved by cer|tificate of burial; together with an affidavit of his or her death, and identity.</P>
<P>If a member dies out of England, &s;ecurity mu&s;t be given to indemnify the corporation, before any claim is paid.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on above the age of forty-five, if in good health, may be admitted in exchange for a member who is older than him&s;elf.</P>

<P>N. B. From the above &s;pecimen, which &s;hews the premium for every tenth year, the reader will ea&s;i|ly judge of the proportional premium for any in|termediate age.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on de&s;iring to make a&s;&s;urance with the &s;o|ciety, mu&s;t &s;ign a declaration by him&s;elf or agent, &s;et|ting forth the age, &s;tate of health, profe&s;&s;ion, occupa|tion, and other circum&s;tances of the per&s;ons who&s;e lives are propo&s;ed to be a&s;&s;ured: and al&s;o, in ca&s;e &s;uch a&s;&s;urance is made upon the life of another per&s;on, that the intere&s;t which he has in &s;uch life is equal to the &s;um a&s;&s;ured. This declaration is the ba&s;is of the con|tract between the &s;ociety and the per&s;on de&s;irous to make &s;uch a&s;&s;urance: and if any artful, fal&s;e, or frau|dulent repre&s;entation &s;hall be u&s;ed therein, all claim, on account of any policy &s;o obtained, &s;hall cea&s;e, de|termine, and be void, and the monies which &s;hall
<PB N="77" REF="97">
have been paid upon account of &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, &s;hall be forfeited to the u&s;e of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on making a&s;&s;urance with the &s;ociety be|comes a member, and enters into a covenant that he will conform to, ob&s;erve, and keep the &s;tatutes, bye-laws, rules, orders, and ordinances of the &s;ociety.&mdash; But no member has a right to vote at a general court, who is not a&s;&s;ured in the &s;um of 100 l. or upwards, upon a life or lives, for the whole continuance there|of.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ociety is conducted and carried on by fifteen directors, annually cho&s;en out of tho&s;e members, who are a&s;&s;ured with the &s;ociety in the &s;um of 300 l. or upwards, upon a life or lives, for the whole continuance thereof.</P>
<P>Four general courts are held every year, on the fir&s;t Thur&s;day of March, June, September and December, or as often as nine members qualified to vote &s;hall think proper, at which times the accounts and &s;tate of the &s;ociety are laid before the per&s;ons pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If at any time it &s;hall appear to a General Court of the Society, that the premiums received, and to be received, will not be &s;ufficient to pay the claims, then the General Court are to direct a call to be made upon the &s;everal members of the Society, in proportion to the &s;ums by them a&s;&s;ured, for making good the defi|ciency; for which call credit is to be given, and the call afterwards to be repaid; with intere&s;t, at the rate of 3 per cent.</P>
<P>If a call &s;hould at any time be requi&s;ite, (which is highly improbable) the members a&s;&s;ured for a &s;ingle year will be rated towards &s;uch call in the proportion of one &s;ixth part, and the members a&s;&s;ured for a number of years certain, in the proportion of two third parts of the &s;um charged upon the members a&s;&s;ured for the whole continuance of life, for every 100 l. by them re&s;pectively a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P>As often as it &s;hall appear to a General Court, that the &s;tock of the Society is more than &s;ufficient to pay the claims liable to be made, then the General Court is to declare a dividend of the &s;urplus, or of &s;uch part thereof as &s;hall be judged convenient, among&s;t the
<PB N="78" REF="98">
members of the &s;ociety liable to contribute towards a call in proportion to the &s;ums in which they are a&s;&s;u|red, and to the number of years of their &s;tanding in the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The court of directors are impowered to a&s;&s;ure either a gro&s;s &s;um, or an annuity, to be paid to children after they &s;hall have attained an age a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The court of directors are impowered to a&s;&s;ure an|nuities for a life or lives, on the payment of a gro&s;s &s;um.</P>
<P>So as the amount of any annuity or annuities to be granted upon any <HI>one</HI> life do not exceed one hundred pounds:</P>
<P>And towards &s;ecuring the payment of the &s;everal annuities, a fund is re&s;erved of two-thirds of the &s;ums originally paid for the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>There are two or three other &s;ocieties for a&s;&s;urance on lives, that pay annuities to widows and children, but they are not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed to put any great dependence on them, of cour&s;e they are not here no|ticed.</P>

<HEAD>PORTERS.</HEAD>
<P>AT the we&s;t end of the town there are no regula|tions among porters; chairmen are chiefly em|ployed in carrying goods and going of errands. See CHAIRMEN, No. 18. Chairmen are very unrea&s;onable in their demands, they will not go a hundred yards with a letter for le&s;s than &s;ixpence, and if they go a mile they expect a &s;hilling. But in the city they are under very good regulations.</P>
<P>The city porters are divided into brotherhoods, and con&s;i&s;t of four &s;orts, viz. Ticket Porters, Fellow&s;hip Porters, Tackle Porters, and Companies Porters.</P>
<P N="1">1. Ticket Porters are all freemen, and their bu&s;ine&s;s is to land and &s;hip off goods, exported or imported, to all parts of America, &amp;c. al&s;o to hou&s;e all merchants goods, metals, &amp;c. go of me&s;&s;ages, &amp;c. They give a hundred pounds &s;ecurity for their fidelity and hone&s;ty, and &s;uch as employ them need only take notice of the names &s;tamped on the ticket that hangs to their girdle, and on complaint made to their Governor at Founders Hall, Lothbury, &s;atisfaction will be made to &s;uch as they have injured.</P>
<P N="2">2. Fellow&s;hip Porters are employed al&s;o as ticket porters. Their chief Governor is the Alderman of Billing&s;gate Ward, to whom complaint is to be made.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tackle Porters, or &s;uch ticket porters as are fur|ni&s;hed with weights, &s;cales, &amp;c. and their bu&s;ine&s;s is to weigh goods, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Companies Porters land and &s;hip off all goods and merchandi&s;e exported and imported to and from all ports near the we&s;t &s;ide of the Sound in the Baltic, Holland, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and all towards and beyond the Cape of Good Hope.</P>

<HEAD>ON WALKING LONDON STREETS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN walking through London, you may always find your way, if, before you &s;et out, you will con|&s;ult a map of London, and attend to the names of the &s;treets and courts, which are always painted on a board again&s;t the hou&s;es, at the corner of each &s;treet or court.</P>
<P N="2">2. If you wi&s;h to walk &s;afe, never pa&s;s under any goods, &amp;c. that are drawing up to the top of a hou&s;e by a crane, nor pa&s;s a hou&s;e where the bricklayers are at work, le&s;t any thing &s;hould fall on your head; it is advi&s;eable, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to cro&s;s the way: and if you would &s;ave your clothes, never pa&s;s under a lamp, whil&s;t the lamp-lighter is triming it, nor go near any rails, &amp;c. fre&s;h painted; or conte&s;t the way with a baker, barber, chimney-&s;weeper, barrow-woman, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the wall or hou&s;es are on your right hand, keep the wall and you will have no interruption, every one will give way.</P>
<P N="4">4. But don't di&s;pute the wall with a cart or carriage, le&s;t you &s;hould be cru&s;hed.</P>
<P N="5">5. Never &s;top in a crowd, or to look at the windows of a print-&s;hop or &s;hew-gla&s;s, if you would not have your pocket picked.</P>
<P N="6">6. Do not walk under a pent-hou&s;e, le&s;t per&s;ons watering flower-pots, or other &s;lops, &s;hould drop upon your head.</P>
<P N="7">7. Be careful, if you meet a porter carrying a load upon his head, that you do not get a blow that may be fatal.</P>
<P N="8">8. If you walk with an umbrella, and meet a &s;imilar machine, lower yours in time, le&s;t you either break it, or get entangled with the other.</P>
<P N="9">9 One &s;ide of the way is generally &s;hady; it is not nece&s;&s;ary perhaps to recommend cro&s;&s;ing to the &s;hady &s;ide in &s;ultry weather, or keeping to windward when the du&s;t flies.</P>
<P N="10">10. In wet weather look where you &s;tep; if you would not be &s;pla&s;hed, don't tread on a loo&s;e &s;tone.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="116" REF="136">11. Don't ha&s;tily cro&s;s a &s;treet when a coach is com|ing up, le&s;t your foot &s;hould &s;lip and you be run over.</P>
<P N="12">12. In fro&s;ty weather it is advi&s;eable to walk in the coach-ways, which are not &s;o &s;lippery as the foot-paths; and to bind a piece of cloth-li&s;t round one of your &s;hoes, it will &s;ave you many a fall.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is very dangerous walking in a thick fog, as you cannot &s;ee the danger before you; people who walk in London &s;hould always look before them, both above and below.</P>
<P N="14">14. It would be prudent for the men to have their coat-pockets open in the lining within; this will often prevent them from being picked. At lea&s;t every one &s;hould attend to his pocket at night, or as he pa&s;&s;es a crowd.</P>

and hat for the coachman to put on, it will be equally the &s;ame as if he was your own &s;ervant.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hackney-chairs may be had at a moment's notice, paying them either for the time or ground they go, ac|cording to the cu&s;tomary rates, or by the week; and if you have two great coats and hats to lend the men for the time, they may be always well equipped. For la|dies, a lady's chair &s;hould be kept in the hall, it pays no duty. The&s;e chairmen in con&s;tant pay will call three or four times a day for orders, and will go on me&s;|&s;ages al&s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. Good wine may be had of the wine-merchants, red or white, at 26 s. a dozen, or 2 s. 3 d. a bottle; other wines in proportion. Good bottled beer or cy|der can always be bought.</P>

<P N="7">7. The London Library, Ludgate-hill, is an in&s;titu|tion of late date, but likely to be a very valuable one.

They do not buy all the tra&s;h that is pub|li&s;hed, but books of character, and &s;uch as are worth reading, French or Engli&s;h, with the foreign Reviews, &amp;c. it being the de&s;ign of this Library to contain all tho&s;e great works of &s;cience which it is difficult for in|dividuals to procure, and every other work of ta&s;te and entertainment.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on paying one guinea entrance, and one guinea per annum, becomes a member of the &s;ociety, and has an intere&s;t in the property of the whole.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on paying ten guineas si a member for life.</P>
<P>The Library is opened every day, Sundays ex|cepted, from March 25, to September 29, from eleven to four, and from five to eight; and from Sep|tember 29 to March 25, from eleven to four only; du|ring which time the members may con&s;ult any books, or &s;end for them to their own hou&s;es. A reading-room and a fire in winter.</P>
<P>Every member may have two books at a time, in his or her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the time of keeping which is regu|lated by the committee, as follows:&mdash;A folio &s;ix weeks, a quarto one month, and an octavo a week; keeping them beyond the time is a forfeit of a trifle to the fund.</P>
<P>If any books be lo&s;t or damaged, that book, or the &s;et, if it belongs to a &s;et, mu&s;t be re-placed by the per|&s;on to whom it was delivered.</P>

<HEAD>ON GOING TO PUBLICK WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>I Believe, in this degenerate age, the be&s;t method of inducing people to attend the &s;ervice of the church, is to point out to them the penalties they are liable to for non-attendance, and to &s;hew them how much they lie at the mercy of an ill-natured neighbour or a mer|cenary informer.</P>
<P N="1">1. All per&s;ons, having no lawful or rea&s;onable ex|cu&s;e for being ab&s;ent, &s;hall re&s;ort to their pari&s;h church or chapel, or, upon rea&s;onable let thereof, to &s;ome u&s;ual place where divine &s;ervice &s;hall be performed, according to the liturgy and practice of the church of England, upon every Sunday and holiday, on pain of puni&s;hment by the cen&s;ures of the church, or of for|feiting 1 s. for every offence to the poor, to be levied by the churchwardens by di&s;tre&s;s. 1 Eliz. c. 2. Ex|cept Di&s;&s;enters tolerated. 1 W. c. 18. Pro&s;ecution to be in one month after default. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. And he who is ab&s;ent from his own pari&s;h church &s;hall be put to prove, where he went to church. 1 Haw 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every per&s;on above the age of &s;ixteen years, who &s;hall not repair to &s;ome church, chapel, or u&s;ual place of common prayer, on conviction, &s;hall fofeit 20 l. a month, one third to him who &s;hall &s;ue. 23 Eliz. c. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. And this penalty of 20 l. a month di&s;pen&s;eth not with the forfeiture of 12 d. a Sunday. 1 Haw. 13.</P>
<P N="5">5. And every offender in not repairing to divine &s;ervice, having been once convicted (and not conform|ing) &s;hall pay 20 l. a month into the Exchequer, in the term of Ea&s;ter or Michaelmas, next after &s;uch convic|tion, and al&s;o &s;hall, without any other indictment or conviction, for every month after &s;uch conviction, &s;o long as he &s;hall not conform, pay as much as &s;hall then remain unpaid, after &s;uch rate of 20 l. a month; and, in default of any part of &s;uch payments, the King may by proce&s;s &s;eize all the goods and two parts of the land of &s;uch offender. 29 Eliz. c. 6. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="6">6. Or the King may refu&s;e the 20 l. a month, though

duly tendered, and &s;eize two parts of the lands at his option. 3 Jac. c. 4.</P>
<P N="7">7. But copyhold lands are not within the &s;tatute, 1 Haw. 14.</P>
<P N="8">8. And every per&s;on who &s;hall u&s;ually on Sundays have in his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e divine &s;ervice as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and be thereat him&s;elf u&s;ually pre&s;ent, and &s;hall four times a year go to the pari&s;h church, or other common church or chapel, &s;hall not incur any penalty for not repairing to church. 23 Eliz c. 1.</P>
<P N="9">9. But this &s;hall not extend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alified Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, who re&s;ort to &s;ome place of religious wor|&s;hip allowed by the act of toleration. 1 W c. 18.</P>

<P N="11">11. No recu&s;ant convict (that is a per&s;on once con|victed and not conforming) &s;hall practice law or phy|&s;ic, nor &s;hall be judge or mini&s;ter of any court, or have any military office by &s;ea or land, and &s;hall forfeit for every offence 100 l. 3 J. c. 5.</P>
<P N="12">12. And the church-wardens and con&s;tables &s;hall (on pain of 20 l.) pre&s;ent at the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, once a year, the monthly ab&s;ence from church of all re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ants, and the names and ages of their children above nine years of age, and the names of their &s;ervants. And if the party pre&s;ented &s;hall be indicted and convicted, &s;uch church-warden or con&s;table &s;hall have a reward of 40s. to be levied on the recu&s;ant's goods. 3 J. c. 4.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is difficult for new comers in to any pari&s;h to obtain a pew in the pari&s;h church: but churches are &s;eldom &s;o full but they may find a &s;eat in the pew, of others. Indeed the pew openers, for a &s;hilling now and then given them, will &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a per&s;on commodiou&s;ly.</P>
<P N="14">14. But at the private chapels about town, a pew to hold &s;ix may be rented for about 5 l. or 6 l. a year, or one per&s;on may be &s;eated agreeable to his wi&s;hes for

<PB N="146" REF="166">
<HEAD><HI>Sundry</HI> CAUTIONS <HI>again&s;t</HI> ROBBERIES, FRAUDS, IMPOSITIONS <HI>and</HI> INSULTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. PERSONS travelling to or from London &s;hould be careful not to take too much money with them. Bank po&s;t-bills, made payable to the holder or order, is the &s;afe&s;t conveyance; for the&s;e are of no va|lue till indor&s;ed by the per&s;on they are made payable to; and if lo&s;t, as the bank does not pay them till &s;even days after &s;ight, there is time to give notice of the lo&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Trunks, &amp;c. &s;hould not be fa&s;tened behind car|riages, unle&s;s with chains, or unle&s;s &s;ervants ride be|hind, and will attend to them till they are ten or twelve miles from the metropolis; for there are thieves fre|quently waiting at the out&s;kirts of the town, particular|ly in the evening, to cut &s;uch luggage from behind.</P>
<P N="3">3. If trunks, boxes, or packages are to be &s;ent by coaches or waggons into the country, it is prudent to let &s;ome per&s;on be pre&s;ent at the packing up, as a wit|ne&s;s of the contents, and to take a li&s;t of what the trunk, &amp;c. contains. This per&s;on &s;hould then take it to the warehou&s;e of the coach or waggon him&s;elf, and deliver it to the book-keeper, &s;ee it booked, and pay for the booking, which is 2 d. In this ca&s;e, if it be lo&s;t, you will be able to prove the contents, and reco|ver the value from the owner of the coach or waggon. See STAGE-COACHES, 2.</P>
<P N="4">4. But let your &s;ervant be very careful not to leave the trunk, &amp;c. with any per&s;on &s;tanding at the door of the inn, or in the inn-yard; but to enquire for the book-keeper, and not part with his load till he can de|liver it into the cu&s;tody of the book-keeper, and &s;ee it booked. On this account the porter &s;hould be able to read writing, to know what he is about. Rogues are very often about inn-yards, to ca&s;e &s;uch me&s;&s;engers of their loads.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such per&s;ons as you &s;end with parcels from one part of the town to another, &s;hould be cautioned not to be led into a public hou&s;e by the way, to drink with any &s;uppo&s;ed countryman, nor to &s;uffer any good-na|tured
<PB N="147" REF="167">
per&s;on in the &s;treet, to give them a hand and help them on the way with their bundle or load; for there are many of the&s;e obliging people in London &s;treets, that when they get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bundle, &amp;c. will run away with it.</P>
<P N="6">6. If you hire a ba&s;ket-woman at market, or a porter to carry any thing for you home, which you may have bought, tell &s;uch per&s;on where they are to carry it, and make them walk before you all the way. Your eye will then be upon them, and if they &s;lip away from you it will he your own fault. If it be inconvenient to attend them, employ no &s;uch per&s;on but whom you know, or is known to the per&s;on with whom you deal. But if you buy of a &s;hop-keeper, they will always &s;end the goods home.</P>
<P N="7">7. Never &s;top in a crowd in the &s;treets, to &s;ee what occa&s;ions it: if you do, it is two to one but you either lo&s;e your watch or your pocket-handkerchief. There are fellows who create di&s;turbances for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. Never carry any bank-notes or bills about you, without fir&s;t entering, in &s;ome book at home, the num|ber and date, and particulars of &s;uch notes, that in ca&s;e you lo&s;e them, or your pocket is picked of your book, you &s;tand &s;ome chance of recovering them, or &s;top the payment.</P>
<P N="9">9. Al&s;o enter, in &s;ome book at home, the number, maker's name, &amp;c. and de&s;cription of your watch, and whatever el&s;e of value you carry about you, that you may know how to de&s;cribe it, if lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. Never part with &s;uch articles out of your hands, to per&s;ons you are unacquainted with.</P>
<P N="11">11. If you would walk &s;afe, you would always avoid crowds, &s;topping to look at the pictures in a print-&s;hop, &amp;c. See p. 115, No. 5, 14.</P>
<P N="12">12. If by chance you &s;hould drop any thing of va|lue in the &s;treet, whil&s;t you are looking for it, you will have many a&s;k you what you have lo&s;t, and offer to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the &s;earch. Tell them it is nothing of any con&s;equence: if you acquaint them, you are likely never to find it, as they will probably find it for you and keep it.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="148" REF="168">13. Give directions to your &s;ervants, on no condi|tion to deliver any thing from your hou&s;e to a &s;tranger, under a pretence of your having &s;ent for it; for in|&s;tance, a great coat or any other thing: there are al|ways villains ready to take advantage of their igno|rance.</P>
<P N="14">14. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, never let them take in a parcel for you, under an idea that it came by &s;uch a carriage, if they are to pay any thing for it; for &s;uch packages have been &s;ound to contain nothing but brick|bats, &amp;c. In &s;hort, never let them pay any thing without your knowledge or order &s;o to do, to any one. Per&s;ons bringing things will often take the money be|fore hand, and a&s;k for it again at the hou&s;e they carry it to.</P>
<P N="15">15. Before you get into a hackney-coach or chair, always take the number, as, if you leave any thing therein, you may then, by &s;ummoning the coachman, or chairman, to the Hackney-coach office, probably re|cover it. They may &s;ay they never &s;aw it, and po&s;|&s;ibly their next fare might find it and take it: po&s;&s;ibly &s;o. This is a lie, for they always look, when they &s;et down a fare, before they &s;hut the door. To be truly &s;afe in this matter, every one &s;hould look round the coach or chair before they quit it.</P>
<P N="16">16. Thieves have lately made a practice of knock|ing at doors in an evening, under a pretence of deli|vering a letter, and, when the door is open, if in a retired place, have ru&s;hed in, in numbers, and robbed the family. To avoid this, a chain &s;hould be always put acro&s;s the door within, (&s;o as to admit the door to open a little way) before du&s;k, and the door not open|ed to a &s;tranger, but the letter, if any, taken in.</P>
<P N="17">17. If you do not &s;it in your front-parlour in an evening, take care the windows are fa&s;tened down, for men have been known to enter a hou&s;e this way, &s;ecrete them&s;elves till the family is a&s;leep, and then rob the hou&s;e; or they have robbed that room only, while the family have been backwards, and decamped the &s;ame way.</P>
<P N="18">18. If the hou&s;e next door to you is empty, be cau|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous and fa&s;ten your back-doors, and in&s;ide-&s;hutters of
<PB N="149" REF="169">
the upper windows; for villains will now and then &s;e|crete them&s;elves in &s;uch empty hou&s;es, and, in the night, get into the adjoining hou&s;e, by the back-doors or windows, or from the leads. Your garret-windows therefore &s;hould always be &s;ecured, and trap-doors opening to the leads well bolted.</P>
<P N="19">19. Before you come out of any play-hou&s;e, or place of public entertainment, take care to &s;ecure your watch and your pockets, for pick-pockets are always about at &s;uch places.</P>
<P N="20">20. Never &s;uffer any beggars to be begging at your door, particularly if you live in any retired place, for, under a pretence of begging, if they &s;ee no one in the way, they will be &s;ure to rob you of &s;omething.</P>
<P N="21">21. Do not &s;uffer your&s;elf to be impo&s;ed on by beg|gars in the &s;treets, for they have all their arts, and will affect di&s;tre&s;s to excite your humanity; if you have any thing to give, it would be be&s;t be&s;towed to poor di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed families; it is a mi&s;taken charity to give to beg|gars in the &s;treets, whom the laws have provided for.</P>
<P N="22">22. Auctions in great thorough-fares, in the day-time, where men &s;tand at the door and invite pa&s;&s;en|gers, are great impo&s;itions. Slight ill-made goods are made up for &s;uch auctions, and if you buy, it is ten to one but you are cheated, and give twice the value of the article purcha&s;ed. Never buy at an auction, but where the auctioneer is known to be a reputable man. At auctions of linen-drapery, they will put, perhaps, &s;ufficient painted mu&s;lin for a gown, and a piece of dowlas, worth 7 d. a yard, and &s;ell the two at one price per yard; from an opinion that there may not be above thirty yards of dowlas, you bid accordingly, but, when mea&s;ured, there &s;hall be &s;ixty, of cour&s;e you are deceived and cheated.</P>
<P N="23">23. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, never buy at a pawn-brokers &s;uch articles as they di&s;play at their windows; for a notion of buying things cheap, has drawn many to buy at the&s;e places; and this has led the pawn-bro|kers to get things made up purpo&s;ely for &s;ale, in a &s;light manner. Half the things at their windows are new, and &s;old as &s;econd-hand.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="150" REF="170">24. Indeed, in purcha&s;ing, it will be always &s;ound be&s;t to purcha&s;e of, and employ people of credit, though you pay rather a greater price, for they have a cha|racter at &s;take, and will u&s;e you well, in hopes of hav|ing your cu&s;tom in future; but if you buy in general of tho&s;e who under&s;ell the fair trader, and adverti&s;e things at a very low price, depend upon it, unle&s;s you are a very good judge of the articles you buy, and take e&s;pecial care, you will be taken in.</P>
<P N="25">25. People in di&s;tre&s;s are always wanting to borrow money, and hold out advantageous terms in adverti&s;e|ments to lenders. Be ever on your guard in this mat|ter, and al&s;o again&s;t tho&s;e who publicly, by adver|ti&s;ement, offer to rai&s;e money on &s;ecurities. They will get the &s;ecurities into their hands, &s;uch as bonds, notes, &amp;c. and will frequently &s;huffle you out of them. To the&s;e the public have given the denomination of &s;windlers. If you are in trade, be cautious how you are taken in by cu&s;tomers you are a &s;tranger to. There are a number of people in town, who live by getting goods on credit, and taking in the incautious &s;hop-keeper.</P>
<P N="26">26. Be very circum&s;pect and cautious of having any thing to do with notes of hand or accepted drafts, drawn by people you are unacquainted with, for it is by &s;uch modes that the unwary are duped and robbed of their property.</P>
<P N="27">27. If you keep an open &s;hop, never &s;uffer a &s;tran|ger to leave a parcel in your &s;hop, (under a pretence of having further to go, and wi&s;hing it to be taken care of till his return) unle&s;s you know the contents of the parcel. Men have been known to leave contraband goods, in this manner, and go and inform again&s;t the &s;hop-keeper, in order to get the penalty. In like manner, a &s;ack of unroa&s;ted coffee has been left at a grocer's, and he has been exchequered in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P N="28">28. Never &s;tep in between per&s;ons quarrelling in the &s;treet, unle&s;s you chu&s;e to have your pocket picked. The&s;e are often &s;ham-quarrels, to collect people toge|ther for the opportunity of plundering them.</P>
<P N="29"><PB N="151" REF="171">29. Any one may arre&s;t a felon, even without a warrant.</P>
<P N="30">30. Where per&s;ons, by fraud in gaming, win above 10 l. they &s;hall forfeit five times the value, and &s;uffer &s;uch corporal puni&s;hment as in ca&s;es of wilful perjury. 9 Ann. c. 14.</P>
<P N="31">31. Shop-keepers &s;hould be on their guard again&s;t per&s;ons coming in and looking over a great quantity of goods, without purcha&s;ing. Sharpers often, making a genteel appearance, will take an opportunity, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, when the &s;hop-keeper's back is turned, to pil&s;er and purloin.</P>
<P N="32">32. In return, buyers &s;hould always be careful that they are not impo&s;ed on by &s;hop-keepers, for they will often &s;urvey you from head to foot, and a&s;k a price ac|cording to their cu&s;tomer. They will often a&s;k 10 s. for an article at a coach-&s;ide, which they will &s;ell for, to a per&s;on on foot, for half the money.</P>
<P N="33">33. Shop-keepers who have the reputation of &s;el|ling cheap, will evidently do &s;o, in &s;ome &s;mall articles, the price of which every buyer is acquainted with; but they take care to bring up the <HI>lee-way,</HI> as the &s;ea|man's phra&s;e is, and make you pay hand&s;omely in other things. In &s;hort, every trade&s;man mu&s;t live, and there are &s;uch numbers of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion in Lon|don, that they are obliged to make u&s;e of a variety of artifices to get cu&s;tom; and the buyer, with all his cle|verne&s;s and care, &s;hall not often be able to avoid being taken in.</P>
<P N="34">34. It often happens, that if a parcel is &s;ent in from the country, by a waggon, and ordered to be left till called for, and you &s;end for it, that they will tell you no &s;uch thing is brought, and then the porter of the inn will bring it, in order to get a &s;hilling or two: in this ca&s;e give him nothing, but before you give him to un|der&s;tand &s;o, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, otherwi&s;e he will take it back again: &s;hould this fellow, by way of re|venge, if any game is &s;ent you, and not ordered to be delivered, not bring it, and it &s;poils, and the ma&s;ter of the waggon does not di&s;charge him, &s;ummon the ma&s;|ter to the Court of Con&s;cience, for the value of the thing &s;poilt, and you will be never &s;erved &s;o again.
<PB N="152" REF="172">
Porters of inns are in general very exorbitant in their demands, and very in&s;olent. If they a&s;k too much for bringing a thing, never pay it, but tell them they may take it back again, and you will &s;end for it.</P>
<P N="35">35. Per&s;ons would do well to be careful of their hats in public companies; for want of &s;uch care, many a per&s;on has brought home an old hat for a new one.

<P N="9">9. In the city of London, the expence of taking out a &s;ummons is 8 d. and the hearing, which mu&s;t take place the next day of &s;itting, is attended only with the expence of 4 d.</P>
<P N="10">10. At St. Margaret's-hill, the days of hearing are Tue&s;days and Fridays, in the afternoon, and the expence 4 d. The &s;ummons, if a common one, is 6 d. if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pecial one, 10 d.

a common &s;ummons, but he mu&s;t of a &s;pecial one. An execution is 2 s. and 8 d. is paid on receiving the debt.</P>
<P N="11">11. When the party has been &s;erved with an order, if he does not attend, the court adjudges the debt due to the plaintiff, and an execution is taken out, which &s;eizes either the goods or the per&s;on of the debtor, and unle&s;s the money is then paid, and the co&s;ts, he is car|ried to pri&s;on.</P>
<P N="12">12. The &s;ummon&s;es for the Borough di&s;trict are ta|ken out at No. 2, Maze-pond, behind Guy's ho&s;pital.</P>
<P N="13">13. At the courts in Vine-&s;treet, and Ca&s;tle-&s;treet, the price of a &s;ummons is 8 d. of an order 2 s. 2 d. of a hearing, after the delivery of a &s;ummons, 2 s. 2 d. of a hearing after the &s;erving of an order, 1 s. 3 d. the co&s;t of an execution is 2 s. 6 d. and the plaintiff's re|ceiving his money 8 d. All the co&s;ts, except the la&s;t 8 d. the defendant is obliged to re-pay.</P>
<P N="14">14. The day of hearing at the court at Fullwood's Rents is Thur&s;day; the Judge of this court is the County Clerk, who acts by deputy. The co&s;t of a &s;ummons is 1 s. 4 d. of an order 2 s. of a hearing 2 s. of an execution 3 s. 4 d. The&s;e the defendants pay in the end, and the plaintiff can receive his money with|out a fee.</P>
<P N="15">15. The determinations of the Courts of Con&s;cience are final, but they generally indulge the debtor with time to pay the money, if he reque&s;ts it. They will &s;uffer him to pay it at a &s;hilling or &s;ix-pence a week; this money mu&s;t be regularly paid into the court, or an attachment again&s;t the party i&s;&s;ues; and when the time elap&s;es in which the whole debt is paid, the plaintiff applies to the court for his money, and receives it on paying a few pence.</P>
<P N="16">16. The plaintiffs and defendants in the&s;e courts are in general people &s;o very low, that a gentleman would &s;ooner lo&s;e 40 s. than attend them. If he is a defend|ant, it is be&s;t to get &s;ome per&s;on to attend for him; if plaintiff, and can prove his demand, he may even then get &s;ome per&s;on to apply for him; but if he cannot prove his debt otherwi&s;e than by his own oath, he &s;hould attend him&s;elf, for if he has no other proof, the plaintiff's oath is always &s;ufficient. Of cour&s;e, it is
<PB N="156" REF="176">
better in the&s;e courts to be plaintiff than defendant, for if the plaintiff &s;wears to his debt, no oath of the defen|dant will avail him.</P>
<P N="17">17. In order to recover in the&s;e courts, the debt mu&s;t be under 40 s. (at lea&s;t the claim mu&s;t), and both parties mu&s;t re&s;ide in London. The &s;ummons mu&s;t be taken out in that court in who&s;e di&s;trict the defendant lives.</P>
<P N="18">18. No oath is required on taking out the &s;ummons, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pell the defendant's name right, or know his chri&s;tian name; all that is required is to know where he is to be found, that the &s;ummons may be left at his place of re&s;idence; if the party will not attend by a &s;ummons, it is nece&s;&s;ary to get the chri&s;tian name of the defendant, in order to obtain an order, and if he is a hou&s;ekeeper this is readily got at, by applying to the ve&s;try-clerk of the pari&s;h where he lives, and examining the poors-rate book.</P>

<HEAD>THE VERGE OF THE COURT</HEAD>
<P>IS that ground about White-hall and St. James's, which belongs to the crown, and which is privi|leged from arre&s;ts. This privileged place includes Charing-cro&s;s, on the north &s;ide of the way, from the' corner of St. Martin's-lane to Hedge-lane, and both the King's meu&s;es. On the &s;outh &s;ide, from the &s;treet leading into Spring-gardens, to the public hou&s;e beyond the Trea&s;ury, and all Spring-gardens; on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way, from Northumberland-hou&s;e to the end of Privy-garden in Parliament-&s;treet, taking in all Scot|land-yard, Whitehall, and Privy-garden. It further includes all the parks, the &s;table-yard St. James's, Cleveland-court, and all Hyde-park, except the mere cro&s;&s;ing from the Green-park to Hyde-park. Mo&s;t hou&s;es in the Verge let lodgings, and I knew an artful fellow once that eluded all his creditors, by re&s;iding there; if he wanted to go out of it, he took water at Whitehall-&s;tairs, which place is privileged, and as no writ can be &s;erved on the water, without a water-bailiff's warrant, which cannot be immediately procu|red, he would land &s;afely in the city, or on the Surry &s;ide: for a Middle&s;ex writ lo&s;es its force in the city, and in Surry, unle&s;s backed by a city or Surry magi&s;|trate, which requires time and preparation to get done; &s;o that, if he landed in Surry, he might take his hor&s;e and ride to the land's-end, or he would occa&s;ionally walk through the parks, and order his hor&s;e to wait for him on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. By this means, he con|&s;tantly eluded the &s;heriff's officers, who could not be in every place, or eternally watching him.</P>

<P>By this e&s;timate, the expences are le&s;s than keeping them in your own &s;table. To be &s;ure, you have none of the coachman's &s;ervice but that of driving, but then, on the other hand, you are not liable to lo&s;e the u&s;e of your carriage by accidents attending the hor&s;es. In|deed, to keep a chariot and pair of hor&s;es properly, three hor&s;es &s;hould be kept for the purpo&s;e; and this advantage you have by hiring a job. If you will give the coachman his board, you may have all his time.</P>
<P>In the foregoing, and the following e&s;timates, I have not pointed out, what a father of a family ought to lay by annually, as a provi&s;ion for his wife and children. When he knows what his expences will be, his income will naturally tell him what he can &s;ave. Suffice it to &s;ay, that 75l. a year, put out to intere&s;t at five per
<PB N="173" REF="193">
cent. will, in twenty years, produce 2500l. of cour&s;e, double the &s;um will produce 5000l. I have, in the cour&s;e of this work, given the reader the terms of the different a&s;&s;urance-offices for life, where provi&s;ion may be made for a family, or a future day, on ea&s;ier terms.</P>
<P>The principal hay-markets in London are, Smith-field, White-chapel, and the Hay-market, Charing-cro&s;s. Market-days are, Tue&s;days, Thur&s;days, and Saturdays.</P>
<P>The average-price of hay, in London, is 3 l. 5 s. a load: and that of &s;traw 1 l. 5 s. Good hay is &s;ome|times bought for 2 l. 5 s. and &s;ometimes it reaches 5 l. Straw will &s;ometimes be &s;o low as 18 s. at other times 2 l. 2 s.</P>
<P>A load of hay is thirty-&s;ix tru&s;&s;es, each tru&s;s to weigh 56 lb. under a penalty; a load of &s;traw thirty-&s;ix tru&s;|&s;es, each tru&s;s to weigh 36 lb.</P>

If every mi&s;tre&s;s keeps a weekly book, in the manner &s;he will find pointed out to her in the next page, and has an eye upon her &s;ervants, &s;hould &s;he exceed her expences one week, &s;he may retrench them in another.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t repeat here, that 15 or 20 per cent. may be &s;aved in many articles, by buying them at the fir&s;t hand, and paying ready money, where it conveniently can be done, be&s;ides preventing things being charged a family never had. However, by no means &s;hould a bill be run up, with either butcher, baker, chandler, green-grocer, or milkman.</P>
