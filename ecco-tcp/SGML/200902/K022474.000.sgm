<P>THAT this Poem is authentic we have the be&s;t Authority: That it has high Merit no one will doubt, who has the &s;malle&s;t Preten&s;ion to Ta&s;te. It has all the Enthu&s;ia&s;m and poetic Colouring which &s;uit the Ode; and it breathes a Spirit of Liberty that would not have di&s;graced a Citizen of Sparta, or of Rome.</P>
