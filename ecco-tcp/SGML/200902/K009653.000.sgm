<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SO many things of con&s;equence offer at this time, that I find I &s;hall &s;well my De&s;ign to a much greater length than I imagined: In&s;tead of Writing once a Week, I &s;hall never be able to retain &s;o many memorable Particulars, or get thro' my Promi&s;e, without adju&s;ting the Sub&s;tance every Po&s;t.</P>
<P>You would &s;plit your Sides at the late Set of Servants, and their <HI>Favourers,</HI> in this Town, were you to &s;ee how they behave them&s;elves in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances?
<PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y">
What a mixture they di&s;cover in their Coun|tenances of the Sullen and the Impertinent; or indeed of the Spaniel and the Lion. They wou'd fain lay a timely claim to the good Graces and Favour of Mr. <HI>WRIGHT,</HI> but their Preten&s;ions are awkardly made out, and built on &s;uch &s;encele&s;s Foundations, that 'tis queer enough to hear them explain 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Harry Aucumy,</HI> who is at leizure now to carry on all the Intrigues that lay upon his Hands, has had a very great Levee of Condo|lants &s;ince his late Misfortune; for &s;ay they, <HI>Harry</HI> appeared a Man of Spirit, and was al|ways firm to his <HI>Purpo&s;e. Harry</HI> was re&s;olute and con&s;tant in the Mea&s;ures he pur&s;ued, and wou'd have pu&s;hed Things with another man|ner of Spirit than that unaccountable Fellow <HI>Slyboots</HI> &s;hew'd, <HI>who had been a&s;leep for three Years,</HI> and always kept his <HI>Friends</HI> as well as his <HI>Enemies</HI> in doubt what he de&s;igned. <HI>Harry</HI> was the Life of the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> the Joy of the Par|ty, and the Toa&s;t of the <HI>CLUB.</HI> From <HI>Har|ry</HI> we expected &s;omething very great and &s;ur|prizing; he had a Spirit and Impudence really fitted for it. Our hopes in him daily increa&s;|ed; we &s;aw him, on <HI>Robin</HI>'s Downfal, which was owing to his dextrous Conduct, placed in a Sphere, whereby his excellent Talents wou'd have come to &s;hine in their full Lu|&s;tre; nay, he had manag'd it &s;o admirably, that he &s;ent the Trick&s;ter <HI>Robin</HI> off the Stage
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">
with the utmo&s;t Di&s;grace, which for Rea&s;ons well known to us, would have proved of Ser|vice to future Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not &s;tay to fini&s;h the <HI>Encomiuns</HI> the&s;e Vi&s;itants of <HI>Harry</HI>'s be&s;tow'd on him, without letting you know, that they were &s;uch Friends of young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s, as began to place the greate&s;t Confidence in him, from the &s;everal &s;teps which they plainly &s;aw he had taken in his Favour. The re&s;t were &s;uch as <HI>Harry</HI> had really let into the Secret; and among whom there ran a mutu|al and entire Chain of Confidence, in which they wou'd all rather have Hang'd together, than to have broke their Faith with one another.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t it not therefore be the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Mortification to Men elated with &s;uch Hopes, and in&s;pired by a <HI>Genius</HI> &s;o very promi&s;ing as <HI>Harry</HI>'s to promote their Views, to &s;ee him at two Steps fall headlong from &s;uch an Emi|nence of Power and Authority, and lye the bleeding Sacrifice of a <HI>Ruined-Party</HI> at the Feet of his Enemies, de&s;pis'd, threaten'd and level'd to their Re&s;entments by the Act of the new <HI>LANDLORD,</HI> who &s;ingled him out, like a Deer for the Chace, to be the common Sport of all the hone&s;t Servants and Tenants; nay, even to his Antagoni&s;t <HI>Robin?</HI> What can &s;hew a Man more de&s;pis'd than the Me&s;|&s;age
<PB N="6" REF="5">
delivered him by the <HI>TRUSTEES</HI> for his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Aucumy,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your Proceedings having rendered your Con|duct &s;u&s;pected, we are Order'd by our new LANDLORD Mr. WRIGHT to tell you, that he has no farther Service for you; with Directions likewi&s;e to take from you your Books of Accounts, and Seal up the COUNTING-HOUSE.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>You may be &s;ure his Friends bleed inwardly for him; but they have, indeed, the mo&s;t admirable way of out-facing Things that e|ver was known. They had before this given out, that he &s;tood on no bad terms with Mr. WRIGHT, and chiefly, that on the fir&s;t In|di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Widdow,</HI> it was he who pro|moted the Delivery of <HI>BOB</HI>'s <HI>Conjuring-VVand</HI> into the Hands of the <HI>Chamberlain;</HI> which He could not chu&s;e but acknowledge as a piece of good Service: But this is &s;ome|what like <HI>BOB</HI>'s <HI>INVIOLABLE ATTACH.</HI></P>
<P>This they maintain'd with an A&s;&s;urance peculiar to them, till the time of <HI>Harry</HI>'s di&s;|grace, when a fre&s;h A&s;toni&s;hment appeared in them; and for two or three Days there was a general run of <HI>Guilty</HI> confu&s;ed Faces a|mong
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the Party, <HI>Harry</HI> him&s;elf &s;tood this &s;hock with a great deal of outward Confi|dence before his Friends, becau&s;e he was un|willing to di&s;courage them, but alas we know that nothing but a clear and un&s;potted Con|&s;cience can really &s;upport a Man's Spirits un|der &s;uch &s;udden and capital Afflictions. This required that they &s;hould give their Senti|ments a new turn, and now <HI>Harry</HI> was con&s;o|led by his Friends as a Man purely &s;uffering for his Principles, and one who de&s;erved all the Confidence they had placed in him.</P>
<P>One wou'd think this Indication &s;hould have taught them a little Mode&s;ty, but they go on at the old rate: They will not &s;tand convinced that they have a le&s;s &s;hare of the Favour of Mr. WRIGHT than others, tho' it is with the utmo&s;t Impudence and Vanity they dare, even make Pretences to it. They are the mo&s;t impatient People at the lo&s;s of Power imaginable, and certainly make the wor&s;t u&s;e of it when they have it of any living, for they are all Heat and Choler: whence it is ob&s;ervable, thro' their precipitate and Po&s;t|ha&s;te Fury, that they have never been long before they fini&s;hed their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>They have the merrie&s;t Way of Inter|preting Things that can be: They pretend they are very impatient for the arrival of the New LANDLORD, being unea&s;ie at
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the Management of the TRUSTEES, who have gone a great way toward putting the Affairs of the <HI>INN</HI> in a better Po&s;ture, and to draw a better Trade to the whole <HI>Town.</HI> They cannot, or rather will not be|lieve, that the Choice of the TRUSTEES has any thing of the true Meaning of Mr. WRIGHT in it; but that it was done up|on their own Solicitations and Intelligence; and that they doubt not, <HI>but they &s;hall &s;oon convince him when they come to talk with him.</HI></P>
<P>Wou'd it not anger one that the&s;e Fel|lows &s;hould have the Impudence to form the&s;e prepo&s;terous Sugge&s;tions? (for I will forgive the Folly of it) Do they think he has forgot, or ever will, their turning two or three of his Servants out of the Hou&s;e in a rude Sort of Manner, though they paid ho|ne&s;tly for what they called for, only becau&s;e they gave their Ma&s;ter Notice of their In|trigues? Was any thing more gro&s;ly Impu|dent than <HI>Harry</HI>'s Conduct in this Matter? Or his in&s;piring the CLUB to do all they could to hinder <HI>Young Mr. VVright</HI> from coming among them? They are mi&s;taken if they think him a Per&s;on &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted as to be deceived in di&s;tingui&s;hing his <HI>Friends</HI> from his <HI>Foes:</HI> And if tho&s;e who have al|ways appeared in his Intere&s;t, and on all Oc|ca&s;ions ju&s;tified their Love to him, are not to
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="y">
be intitled to his Favour; nay, if his own Sence of this, in chu&s;ing &s;uch for TRUS|TEES, is not &s;ufficient to prove it, I leave them to be corrected by their own Folly.</P>
<P>Every Reed &s;erves a drowning Man to catch at; you wou'd &s;mile, did you but know the mighty Splutter they make, that their Con&s;ort, <HI>Tom Scatterwit,</HI> has &s;hook Hands with Mr. WRIGHT. Now you mu&s;t know there is no more in it than this. <HI>Tom</HI> was Agent for the Widow at <HI>NICK FROG</HI>'s, e&s;pecially on the Compo&s;ition: <HI>Tom,</HI> like the re&s;t of his Fraternity, was a very active furious Fellow, and when Rea&s;on wou'd not do, he u&s;ed to cock his Hat, and tread upon <HI>NICK</HI>'s Toes. <HI>NICK</HI> made damn'd &s;our Faces, but was not able to cope with the young Bully. <HI>Nick,</HI> in his Time had been a very &s;turdy Fellow, but he was then cur&s;edly pinched with Corns, and could hardly &s;tir out of his Elbow-Chair: 'Tis true, he kicked and winced a little, but <HI>Tom</HI> always turned him by main Strength, and in the End work'd him into Temper to con|&s;ent quietly to the Agreement. <HI>Tom,</HI> on the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Death, lay under dreadful Appre|hen&s;ions; he was con&s;cious that a very good Under&s;tanding wou'd en&s;ue between Mr. WRIGHT and <HI>NICK;</HI> and that if <HI>NICK</HI> &s;hould remember the Smart of his Toes, it wou'd prove but a little queer for him.
<PB N="10" REF="9" MS="y">
<HI>Tom</HI> therefore came to <HI>NICK,</HI> and &s;hewed a geat deal of unu&s;ual Conde&s;cen&s;ion. In|&s;tead of the Bully Cock, he now came Cap in Hand, and entered into an Expo&s;tulation &s;omewhat &s;ervile. He de&s;ir'd <HI>NICK</HI> to for|get old Grudges, and to make the be&s;t of Matters to Mr. WRIGHT. <HI>NICK</HI> looked a little &s;our on him, as remembering the cur&s;ed Gripes he had given him; howe|ver, like a Man of Honour, he told him he forgave him, and &s;hould be glad to hear of his Conver&s;ion. Another thing likewi&s;e laid <HI>Tom</HI>'s Friends under &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions for him; he was dipped in <HI>Harry</HI>'s Project of entering into a League with Old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI> and his Grand&s;on, tending to the Prejudice of Mr. WRIGHT's Intere&s;t; and had un|luckily written for further Orders therein ju&s;t at the Time of the Widow's Death; which Pacquet falling of cour&s;e into the Hands of the TRUSTEES, they &s;ealed it up, and &s;ent it to Mr. WRIGHT.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Tom</HI> looked plaguy queer upon it at fir&s;t; but it &s;eems he has had a long Conference with Mr. WRIGHT on his arrival at <HI>NICK FROG</HI>'s; which his Friends interpret &s;trangely to his Advantage; not that they think <HI>Tom</HI> will prove very Stanch, but that they love a Fellow of a predominant Spirit. Mo&s;t People laugh hear|tily at this, and &s;ay, that <HI>Tom,</HI> who is an ex|cellent
<PB N="11" REF="10" MS="y">
Fellow at <HI>Congee</HI> and <HI>Grimace,</HI> took all Opportunities to wriggle him&s;elf into Mr. WRIGHT's Acquaintance, and &s;crew'd in at the lower End of the Table to Dinner.</P>
<P><HI>Nick Spitfire,</HI> was to have played the &s;ame Game at 'Squire <HI>SOUTH</HI>'s, but the 'Squire being a Man of Spirit forbid <HI>Nick</HI> the Hou&s;e, and re&s;olved to receive no Me&s;&s;age from the Widow by &s;uch Hands; which put <HI>Nick</HI> up|on the Splutter for lo&s;ing &s;o favourable an Opportunity of exerting him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Bob Bungey</HI> is &s;elling his Equipage again, &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at the Mi&s;carriage of his Bu|&s;ine&s;s to <HI REND="blackletterType">Phil. Baboon. Bob</HI> breeds excel|lent Bullocks, and has got Money by it; but was never looked on to be a Fellow of any tollerable Sence.</P>
<P><HI>Matt Spindle&s;hanks,</HI> the Tavern-Boy, is in a &s;trange Quandary whether he &s;hall return Home, or &s;tay at Old <HI>Savage</HI>'s. 'Tis noted for excellent Air in a Con&s;umption, and 'tis very probable that <HI>Matt,</HI> who is a little in|firm, will chu&s;e it for his Health's Sake. Life is &s;weet, and 'tis very probable that the late Damps that have happened in this Country may be apt to &s;uffocate poor <HI>Matt,</HI> &s;o that his Phy&s;icians have advi&s;ed him, that the other Air is more &s;afe for him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y">
<HI>Peregriue Scamper,</HI> who makes &s;uch a migh|ty Noi&s;e of his CONDUCT, is lately return'd from his la&s;t <HI>Errand.</HI> He pleads a great deal of Merit, and is angry he was not nam'd one of the TRUSTEES. To &s;ay Truth, the Man had had never much Harm in him, but being always thought a little Trouble&s;ome at Home, was u&s;ually &s;ent out of the Way for Quietne&s;s Sake. Mo&s;t Peo|ple would believe he had done &s;ome Service, if he talk'd Je&s;s of it, and had &s;hewn le&s;s Compliance to &s;ome Points which render him a little di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob Ra&s;h,</HI> the New Agent, is the le&s;s concerned at being &s;hut out of the Manage|ment of all Affairs at the INN, becau&s;e it furni&s;hes him with an Opportunity to indulge him&s;elf in a voluptuous Life. He was a zealous Promoter of <HI>Harry</HI>'s New Scheme, and a great Clo&s;eter of the BUFF-COATS upon that Occa&s;ion. <HI>Jacob</HI> has lo&s;t his for|mer Reputation, and has the Misfortune of being looked on as a Tool, when perhaps too much Indolence and good Nature only has been his Fault.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Bia&s;s</HI> the Mal&s;ter, has a greater Incli|nation than a Spirit to do Mi&s;chief: Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, which is in others a Crime, has in him proved a Virtue. He wou'd have gone
<PB N="13" REF="12" MS="y">
greater lengths in Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s Favour, but for the exce&s;&s;ive dread of lo&s;ing his Pelf: Be&s;ides, he &s;aw no rea&s;on why he &s;hould Em|bark on a Level with Fellows of de&s;perate Fortunes. <HI>Bia&s;s</HI> dropt them in &s;everal Im|portant Points, and cry'd, <HI>Safe's the Word:</HI> He was willing to come in for &s;omething a|mong them, but wou'd not run the Hazard of lo&s;ing one of his G&mdash;s for ne'er a Cau&s;e in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> &s;o that People &s;ay, <HI>Though he is no very hone&s;t Man, yet he has proved an excel|lent BOWLER.</HI></P>
<P>I know no one lies more expo&s;ed than <HI>Sim</HI> the Scrivener: <HI>Sim</HI>'s Principles prevailed over his Gratitude, to &s;hew his good Inclinations to Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute.</HI> 'Tis whi&s;pered, that he has already receiv'd his <HI>Quietus;</HI> and no doubt but a Po&s;t or two more will confirm it. <HI>Will Bromingham,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his great Pretences, looks with a very formidable dull Air. He wou'd fain be thought to merit his Place, but I hear Mr. WRIGHT is of ano|ther Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>BOB</HI> and <HI>Harry Aucumy</HI> are as far from being Friends as ever: <HI>Bob</HI> has lo&s;t his Re|putation with both Parties, but <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tands fair with one &s;ide at lea&s;t. In &s;hort, <HI>Harry</HI> appears mo&s;t Guilty, but <HI>Bob</HI> has the more de&s;picable Phiz.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13" MS="y">
<HI>Will Wildfire</HI> would be a &s;olitary Fellow too if he was capable of thinking; but that is what he never did in his Life: He is a great Comforter to <HI>Harry</HI> under his Afflicti|on, and talks mightily of his Intere&s;t in a certain Family he is allied to by Marriage, that are like to come into Favour; but a Bottle I believe is the more &s;olid con&s;olation of the two.</P>
<P><HI>Arthur Skipkennel</HI> has packed up his Move|ables and is ready for the Scamper. <HI>Con</HI>&mdash;is turned out of the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Farm by the TRUSTEES. A Fellow that has done a damn'd deal of Mi&s;chief to the Country there. More of this in my next.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Dimple</HI> has recovered his former Repu|tation. <HI>Tom</HI> you mu&s;t know, was pitched on to carry In&s;tructions to <HI>Jacob Ru&s;h,</HI> in relati|on to <HI>&s;tifling the Evidence,</HI> mentioned in my la&s;t. <HI>Tom,</HI> thought he had been &s;ent to in|fluence the CAUSE; but by a cur&s;ed Ar|tifice found, that <HI>Bob</HI> and <HI>Harry</HI> had &s;ealed his Packet up. <HI>Tom</HI> was cho&s;e <HI>Steward</HI> at the next CLUB, and has &s;hewn him&s;elf a very hone&s;t Friend of Mr. WRIGHT's.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t <HI>Charles Barrier</HI> is made Clerk of the Brewhou&s;e in <HI>Harry</HI>'s Room, which is highly Satisfactory to all hone&s;t Men here;
<PB N="15" REF="14">
and no doubt is an In&s;tance of Mr. WRIGHT's E&s;teem to <HI>Nick Frog,</HI> and to take off the Odi|um of his Conduct in concert with <HI>Charles,</HI> when the CLUB at the INN, in the <HI>VVidow's</HI> Time fell foul on him in opprobious Words; and had like to have &s;ent <HI>Charles</HI> to the <HI>Stocks</HI> for the <HI>Bargain</HI> he made with <HI>Nick</HI> in relation to &s;ome <HI>Cop&s;es</HI> and <HI>Inclo&s;ures</HI> on <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>South</HI>'s E&s;tate, which were to be put in|to <HI>NICK</HI>'s Occupation; wherein <HI>Charles,</HI> as they alledged, &s;uffer'd him to infringe on a TURNIP FIELD or two of the <HI>VVi|dow</HI>'s</P>
<P>Never was Man &s;o joyfully care&s;&s;ed and en|tertained as Mr. WRIGHT was at <HI>NICK</HI>'s Hou&s;e; both he, and all his <HI>Tenants</HI> were ready to devour him for Joy. And indeed, to &s;ay Truth, <HI>NICK</HI> had a great deal of Rea|&s;on for his Exaltation, for he had been u&s;ed but a little &s;curvily in the latter part of the <HI>VVidow</HI>'s Days. Many of the New Servants hated him in their Hearts; and 'twas feared, that to bring about &s;ome other De&s;ign, they wou'd not have &s;tuck to per&s;uade the <HI>VVidow</HI> into a Law Suit again&s;t poor <HI>NICK.</HI> But the&s;e Fears are all cured now, and <HI>NICK</HI> begins to &s;peak and act with his u&s;ual Spirit again.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;wift Current of Affairs at this Time, will not let me, I find, con|clude without a <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jacob Ru&s;h</HI> is di&s;mi&s;t from the Agency and hone&s;t <HI>John Tru&s;ty</HI> has got his Place again. <HI>John</HI> met Mr. WRIGHT on the Road, and wi&s;hing him Joy on his Acce&s;&s;i|on to the E&s;tate; Mr. WRIGHT an|&s;wer'd, <HI>That he was &s;atisfied a great deal was owing to him on that Occa&s;ion; and he &s;hould always very gratefully remember his Ser|vices.</HI></P>
<P>This Day Mr. WRIGHT arrived in Town: Nothing can expre&s;s the great Joy and Satisfaction of the People: He was met
<PB N="17" REF="16" MS="y">
by the Heads of the Town, and conducted to the <HI>INN</HI> thro' Crowds of Spectators, making loud Acclamations.</P>
<P>I ju&s;t now learn that <HI>Harry Aucumy</HI> is &s;ent for to be pre&s;ent at the opening of the COUNT|ING-HOUSE; and that he comes with a hea|vy &s;plenetick Air. The &s;ame Hand informs me, that poor <HI>Sim</HI> has receiv'd a very civil Me&s;&s;age from Mr. WRIGHT, to de&s;ire his Ab&s;ence from the Hou&s;e, to make room for hone&s;t <HI>WILL</HI> the <HI>COOPER.</HI> A Man that can <HI>SEE</HI> a little farther into a Mil|&s;tone than the other. <HI>Sim</HI> takes his misfor|tune very heavily; and &s;ome queer Fellows that u&s;ed to write Hackney under him, are like to be reduced to the Circum&s;tance of wanting Heels to their Shoes again. The&s;e &s;curvy Dogs had ju&s;t as much Love for Mr. WRIGHT as their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e credibly informed that <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>HEAD-OSTLER, Ned Top|&s;ail,</HI> and &s;everal other of the hone&s;t old Ser|vants will have their Places again at the <HI>INN.</HI> The Hou&s;e begins to flouri&s;h, and none are to be admitted but what are known to be Men that have always promoted its Inte|re&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now fini&s;h, for every moment almo&s;t brings me &s;ome fre&s;h Particular, and I ne'er
<PB N="18" REF="17" MS="y">
&s;hould have done if I waited for any Conclu|&s;ive Period.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h this may come &s;afe to your Hands; for the <HI REND="blackletterType">Po&s;t-Boy</HI> is &s;uch a damn'd impudent Ra&s;cal, one is hardly <HI REND="blackletterType">Abel</HI> to expre&s;s it. The Dog &s;old Ballads up and down the Town be|fore, and now &s;ets up for Writing News Letters. He was a great Lurker about <HI>Har|ry</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> and 'tis thought, has convey'd many a private Packet for him to Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute.</HI> He has been often ba&s;ted for his &s;currilous &s;awcy Tongue, without any Effect, but 'tis very probable we &s;hall now bring him to the <HI>VVhipping-Po&s;t.</HI> When <HI>VVill Broming|ham</HI> troops off, he will be forbid coming near the INN; and we hope then to rid the Town of &s;uch a &s;currilous Varlet.</P>
<P>Even whil&s;t I am Writing this &s;hort Po&s;t|&s;cript, there is News of other numerous Changes at the INN, but I cannot enter into Particulars till my next.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t <HI>Dan. Sober&s;ides</HI> is popp'd into old <HI>Bia&s;s</HI>'s TWO-ARM'D-CHAIR, at the CLUB. <HI>Jemmy Brisk,</HI> one of the pret|tie&s;t Fellows in Town, is made <HI>Chief Clerk</HI> in the room of <HI>VVill. Bromingham.</HI></P>
<P>You may perhaps not give this Article its full Weight, but I can a&s;&s;ure you 'tis meant
<PB N="19" REF="18">
as a di&s;tant Compliment to 'Squire SOUTH. <HI>Jemmy</HI> is one he has a particular E&s;teem for; and his Preferment is an Argument that a good Under&s;tanding is renewed with the <HI>'Squire.</HI> I believe you'll &s;oon &s;ee Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI> removed to a little farther Di&s;tance from the E&s;tate. If I don't conclude now, I never &s;hall.</P>
