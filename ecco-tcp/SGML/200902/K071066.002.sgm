<HEAD>II. 3.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Stanza</HI> II. 3.] Pindar was contemporary with Ari&s;tides and Cimon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height. When Xerxes invaded Greece Pindar was true to the com|mon intere&s;t of his country, though his fellow-citizens the Thebans had &s;old them&s;elves to the Per&s;ian king. In one of his odes he expre&s;&s;es the great di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety of his mind occa&s;ioned by the va&s;t preparations of Xerxes again&s;t Greece, <BIBL>(<HI>I&s;thm.</HI> viii.)</BIBL> in another he celebrates the victories of Sala|mis, Plataea, and Himera, <BIBL>(<HI>Pyth.</HI> i.)</BIBL> It will be nece&s;&s;ary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him. Fir&s;t, then, he was thought to be &s;o great a favourite of Apollo that the prie&s;ts of that deity allotted him a con&s;tant &s;hare of their offerings. It was &s;aid of him as of &s;ome other illu&s;trious men, that at his birth a &s;warm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey: it was al&s;o a tradition concerning him that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and &s;een dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real hi&s;torical fact in his life is, that the Thebans impo&s;ed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expre&s;&s;|ed in his poems for that heroick &s;pirit &s;hewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty which his own fel|low-citizens had &s;hamefully betrayed; and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high &s;en|timents of liberty do reciprocaily produce and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, &s;o Pindar is perhaps the mo&s;t exemplary proof of this connexion which occurs in hi&s;tory. The Thebans were re|markable in general for a &s;lavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition through all the for|tunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by Philip, and even in its be&s;t &s;tate under the admini&s;tration of Pelo|pidas and Epaminondas; and every one knows they were no le&s;s remarkable for great dulne&s;s and want of all genius. That Pindar &s;hould have equally di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf from the re&s;t of his fellow-citizens in both the&s;e re&s;pects &s;eems &s;omewhat ex|traordinary, and is &s;carce to be accounted for but by the pre|ceding ob&s;ervation.</NOTE></HEAD>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO CURIO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Curio was a young Roman Senator of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and parts. Being profu&s;ely extravagant he &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated a &s;plendid fortune, to &s;upply the want of which he entered into the de&s;igns of Cae&s;ar again&s;t the liberties of his country, altho' he had formerly been a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to him. Cicero, to who&s;e care he had been committed upon his fir&s;t entrance in|to the Forum, exerted him&s;elf to prevent his ruin, but without effect, and he became one of the fir&s;t victims in the Civil war. This Epi&s;tle was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the 1744, when a celebra|ted patriot was &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;erted the cau&s;e of his coun|try. The Author afterwards transformed it into the Ode to Curio, <Q REND="inline">"a performance di&s;graceful only to its Author,"</Q> &s;ays a celebrated writer. The Epi&s;tle, which is too curious to be omitted, we here give in its original form. The Ode is printed p. 31. of this volume.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<L N="25">Were Love and Chaos; Love the fire of Fate,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>&vers;. 25. <HI>&mdash;Love&mdash;Elder than Chaos.</HI>] He&s;iod in his Theo|gony gives a different account, and makes Chaos the elde&s;t of beings, though he a&s;&s;igns to Love neither father nor &s;uperiour, which circum&s;tance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus in Plato's Banquet as being ob&s;ervable not only in He&s;iod but in all other writers both of ver&s;e and pro&s;e, and on the &s;ame occa&s;ion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is ex|pre&s;sly &s;tyled the elde&s;t of all the gods. Yet Ari&s;tophanes, in The Birds, affirms that <Q REND="inline">"Chaos and Night, and Erebus and Tartarus, were fir&s;t, and that Love was produced from an egg which the &s;able-winged Night depo&s;ited in the immen&s;e bo&s;om of Erebus."</Q> But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the Love de&s;igned by this comick poet was always di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other, from that original and &s;elfexi&s;tent being the &Tgr;&Ogr; &Ogr;&Ngr; or &Agr;&Ggr;&Agr;&THgr;&Ogr;&Ngr; of Plato, and meant only the &Dgr;&EEgr;&Mgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Ggr;&Ogr;&Sgr; or &s;econd per&s;on of the old Grecian trinity, to whom is in|&s;cribed an hymn among tho&s;e which pa&s;s under the name of Orpheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the Fir&s;t-begotten, is &s;aid to have been born of an egg, and is repre&s;ented as the principal or origin of all the&s;e external appearances of Nature. In the Fragments of Orpheus collected by Henry Stephens he is named Phanes, the Di&s;coverer or Di&s;clo&s;er, who unfolded the ideas of the Supreme Intelligence, and expo&s;ed them to the perception of inferiour beings in this vi&s;ible frame of the world, as Mocrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Orpheus which they have pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>But the Love de&s;igned in our text is the one &s;elfexi&s;tent and Infinite Mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologi&s;ts have not introduced or truly de&s;cribed in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances, yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular, though in other re&s;pects he pro|fe&s;&s;eth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions; for in the&s;e great points of natural theology they differ no le&s;s remarkably among them&s;elves, and are perpetually confound|ing the philo&s;ophical relations of things with the traditionary circum&s;tances of mythick hi&s;tory; upon which very account Callimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter declareth his di&s;&s;ent from them concerning even an article of the national creed, adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be de|pended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautick poem a&s;cribed to Orpheus it is &s;aid that <Q REND="inline">"Love, whom mor|tals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eter|nally begotten Night,"</Q> who is generally repre&s;ented by the&s;e mytholOgical poets as being her&s;elf the parent of all things and who in The Indigitamenta, or Orphick Hymns, is &s;aid to be the &s;ame with Cypris, or Love it&s;elf. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautick poem, where the per&s;onated Or|pheus introduceth him&s;elf &s;inging to his lyre in reply to Chi|ron, he celebrateth <Q REND="inline">"the ob&s;cure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within it&s;elf in a &s;tate of perpetual vici&s;&s;itude; how the heaven had its boundary determined, the generation of the earth, the depth of the ocean, and al&s;o the &s;apient Love, the mo&s;t ancient, the &s;elf-&s;ufficient, with all the beings which he produced when he &s;eparated one thing from another:"</Q> which noble pa&s;&s;age is more directly to Ari|&s;totle's purpo&s;e in the fir&s;t book of his Metaphy&s;icks than any of tho&s;e which he has there quoted to &s;hew that the ancient poets and mythologi&s;ts agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the other more &s;ober philo&s;ophers, in that natural antici|pation and common notion of mankind concerning the nece&s;|&s;ity of mind and rea&s;on to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For though neither this poem nor the hymns which pa&s;s under the &s;ame name are, it &s;hould &s;eem, the work of the real Orpheus, yet beyond all que&s;tion they are very ancient. The hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the inva&s;ion of Greece by Xerxes, and were pro|bably a &s;et of publick and &s;olemn forms of devotion, as appears by a pa&s;&s;age in one of them, which Demo&s;thenes hath almo&s;t li|terally cited in his fir&s;t oration again&s;t Ari&s;togiton, as the &s;aying of Orpheus, the founder of their mo&s;t holy my&s;teries. On this account they are of higher authority than any other mytholo|gical work now extant, the Theogony of He&s;iod him&s;elf not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble, and the my&s;terious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind, cannot be better expre&s;&s;|ed than in that remarkable de&s;cription with which they in&s;pi|red the German editor E&s;chenbach when he accidentally met with them at Leip&s;ick: <Q REND="inline">"The&s;aurum me reperi&s;&s;e credidi,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"et pro&s;ecto the&s;aurum reperi.

As to the three Fates or De&s;tinies of the poets, they repre&s;ented that part of the general &s;y&s;tem of natu|ral cau&s;es which relate to man and to other mortal beings, for &s;o we are told in the hymn addre&s;&s;ed to them among the Orphick Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love) and contrary to the vulgar notion are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the epithets of Gentle and Tenderhearted. Accord|ing to <BIBL>He&s;iod, <HI>Theog.</HI> ver. 904,</BIBL> they were the daughters of Ju|piter and Themis, but in the Orphick Hymn to Venus or Love that godde&s;s is directly &s;tyled the mother of Nece&s;&s;ity, and is repre&s;ented immediately after as governing the three De&s;tinies, and conducting the whole &s;y&s;tem of Natural cau&s;es.</NOTE></L>
