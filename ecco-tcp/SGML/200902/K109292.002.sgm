<P>Of the&s;e words, that of <HI>wonder,</HI> implies, admiration at &s;omething extraordinary; <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> is, a &s;udden confu&s;ion of mind, ari&s;ing from either fear or <HI>wonder; amaze|ment,</HI> implies, a greater degree of <HI>a&s;toni&s;h|ment; con&s;ternation,</HI> &s;uch a degree, as almo&s;t borders upon horror, ari&s;ing, chiefly, from dreadful circum&s;tances; as to <HI>&s;urprize,</HI> it means, only, being taken unawares.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e words, <HI>wonder,</HI> and, <HI>&s;urprize,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to be neare&s;t to each other, in &s;ignification; but, even between the&s;e, may be ob&s;erved a difference; the fir&s;t, be|ing generally, con&s;idered, as relative to things, good in them&s;elves, the latter, with re&s;pect to either good or bad.

<HEAD>213. <HI>Liberality, Genero&s;ity, Bounty.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A ready and willing di&s;tribution; accor|ding to our abilities, is the general idea of the&s;e three words; but, they have each, a particular one, as follows: <HI>liberality,</HI> im|plies, acts of mere giving or &s;pending; <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> acts of greatne&s;s; <HI>bounty,</HI> acts of kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>A <HI>liberal</HI> man, gives, freely; a <HI>generous</HI> man, nobly; and, a <HI>bountiful</HI> man, charitably.</P>
<P><HI>Liberality,</HI> is a natural di&s;po&s;ition: <HI>gene|ro&s;ity,</HI> proceeds from elevation of &s;entiment; <HI>bounty,</HI> from religious motives.</P>
<P><HI>Liberality,</HI> denotes, freedom of &s;pirit; <HI>ge|nero&s;ity,</HI> greatne&s;s of &s;oul: <HI>bounty,</HI> openne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Too great <HI>liberality,</HI> borders upon pro|fu&s;ene&s;s; it then, becomes a fault. <HI>Gene|ro&s;ity,</HI> is a princely quality, and, if it does not exceed the bounds of our abilities, is, always, commendable. <HI>Bounty,</HI> is an amia|ble virtue, and never goes unrewarded.</P>

<HEAD>214. <HI>Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, Opiniated, Ob&s;tinate, Infatuated, Head&s;trong.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The&s;e epithets denote a folly, which con|&s;i&s;ts in being too much wedded to our own opinion; but, that, which is particulariz|ed by the word, <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;eems to ari&s;e, from exce&s;s of prejudice, which &s;educes, and, cau&s;es us to think, what we have preconceived, the be&s;t; paying lit|tle or no regard to the opinions of others. In one <HI>opiniated,</HI> this folly &s;eems to be, the effect of an over-fondne&s;s for his own notions, and, a contempt for tho&s;e, of o|thers. <HI>Ob&s;tinacy,</HI> &s;eems to &s;pring, from an affected perver&s;ene&s;s, which renders it intractable, and, which, again&s;t the rules of good-breeding, will never give way. An <HI>infatuated</HI> per&s;on, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be folly-&s;truck, to &s;uffer &s;ome lo&s;s of rea&s;on, which is the occa&s;ion of that inflexibility we ob&s;erve in him. As to the word, <HI>head|&s;trong,</HI> though, often, u&s;ed as &s;ynonymous
<PB N="9" REF="10">with the above; it appears to me, to have a greater relation to a man's actions, inti|mating a blind determination, that &s;tops his ears to every argument, and, renders him ungovernable.</P>
<P><HI>Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> and, <HI>opiniated,</HI> imply, a mind, &s;trongly, prejudiced; <HI>ob&s;tinate,</HI> and, <HI>head|strong,</HI> an unruly will; <HI>infatuated,</HI> a wan|dering in the dark.</P>
<P>Thus, to be <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, opiniated,</HI> or, <HI>infa|tuated,</HI> is involuntary; to be <HI>ob&s;tinate,</HI> or, <HI>headstrong,</HI> voluntary.</P>
<P>A per&s;on <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> follows his own opinions, after examining in &s;ome &s;ort, tho&s;e of others. One, who is <HI>opiniated,</HI> follows his own notions, implicitly, with|out ever li&s;tning to tho&s;e of others. <HI>Obsti|nacy,</HI> pur&s;ues its own way, in &s;pite of every oppo&s;ition, and, often, through mere ca|price. <HI>Infatuation</HI> acts &s;o &s;trongly, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to take away that rea&s;on, which is the light of the mind; and thus dark|ening it, leads a man into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t er|rors. The <HI>head&s;trong</HI> per&s;on, often, acts through a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, and &s;eldom leaves his cour&s;e, till he has completed his ruin.</P>

<HEAD>221. <HI>Empire, Kingdom.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The&s;e are names given to different do|minions, whence princes take the title of emperor, or, king; 'tis not, however, in this alone, that their difference con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that the word, <HI>empire,</HI> conveys an idea of a va&s;t territory, com|po&s;ed of various people; whereas, that of <HI>kingdom,</HI> implies, one more bounded; and, intimates the unity of that nation, of which it is formed. It is, perhaps, from this difference of idea, that the different deno|mination of &s;tates, and, the titles their princes enjoy, take their ri&s;e; if it is not, the only rea&s;on, it is at lea&s;t, the common one, as, we may remark, in the <HI>empire</HI> of Germany, the <HI>empire</HI> of Ru&s;&s;ia, and, in the Ottoman <HI>empire,</HI> of who&s;e diver&s;ity of peo|ple and nations, the world is well acquaint|ed; on the other hand, we &s;ee, in tho&s;e &s;tates which bear the name of <HI>kingdom,</HI> &s;uch, as France, Spain, Poland, &amp;c. that
<PB N="16" REF="17">the divi&s;ion of provinces, does not de&s;troy the unity of the people.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>kingdoms,</HI> a uniformity of fundamental laws; the difference of parti|cular laws, ari&s;ing from different cu&s;toms, which, in no re&s;pect, hurt the unity of po|litical admini&s;tration. It is, from this uni|formity, or, &s;ingle government, that the words <HI>king,</HI> and, <HI>kingdom,</HI> take their ri&s;e; for this rea&s;on, al&s;o, though there may be many per&s;ons in the admini&s;tration, there is, neverthele&s;s, but one prince, or, &s;ove|reign mini&s;ter: but, it is not the &s;ame in <HI>empires;</HI> one part of which, is, &s;ometimes, governed by fundamental laws, very dif|ferent from tho&s;e, by which, another part of the &s;ame <HI>empire</HI> is governed: this di|ver&s;ity, de&s;troys the unity of government; and, 'tis the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of certain chiefs, to the command of a general &s;uperiour, that pre&s;erves the union of the &s;tate: it is, al&s;o, from this right of governing, that the words <HI>emperor,</HI> and, <HI>empire,</HI> are derived. Hence it is, that there are many &s;ove|reigns, and, <HI>kingdoms,</HI> in the &s;ame <HI>empire.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman dominion, was, originally, a <HI>kingdom;</HI> being formed of one &s;ingle people; the name <HI>empire,</HI> was not given it,
<PB N="17" REF="18">till &s;uch time, as it brought under its &s;ub|jection, other foreign ones, who became, though in them&s;elves di&s;tinct nations, members of that &s;tate, and, over whom, the Romans e&s;tabli&s;hed one government, tho' they had &s;eparate admini&s;trations.</P>
<P>The advantages we find in the &s;ociety of a body politic, contributes as much, on the part of &s;ubjects, to form <HI>kingdoms,</HI> as the de&s;ire of governing, on the part of princes. It was ambition, alone, that formed the plan of <HI>empires,</HI> which were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and, are &s;upported, chiefly, by the force of arms.</P>

<P>As different as the&s;e words may appear, they have, neverthele&s;s, been, and, are &s;till, frequently, u&s;ed, as &s;ynonymous, when in|tended to imply court&s;hip. It may not be then unnece&s;&s;ary, to point out their pecu|liar ideas.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> is more &s;anguine, than <HI>gallantry;</HI> having for its object, the per&s;on, whom we are &s;tudious to plea&s;e, through a view of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; and, whom we love as much, on her account, as our own: it takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, &s;uddenly, and, owes its birth, to a certain &s;omething, which enchains the &s;entiments, and, draws the e&s;teem, with|out any examination, or, information. <HI>Gallantry,</HI> is more &s;en&s;ual, than <HI>love;</HI> hav|ing for its object, the &s;ex; we enter into in|trigues, in hopes of enjoying it, and, love,
<PB N="83" REF="84">more on our own account, than on that, of our mi&s;tre&s;s. It acts upon the &s;en&s;es, much more than upon the heart, and, is more, owing to con&s;titution, and, com|plexion, than, to the force of beauty.</P>
<P>The one, has a power of making tho&s;e per&s;ons agreeable in our eyes, who &s;tudy to plea&s;e the object of our love, provided, they in no re&s;pect rai&s;e our jealou&s;y. The other, engages us to keep an eye upon all tho&s;e, who are capable, either, of forward|ing, or, hurting our de&s;igns; and, to watch them, as we would a rival, taking every advantage within our reach.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, leaves us not the liberty of choice; it commands in the beginning, as a ma&s;ter, and, reigns, afterwards, as a tyrant, till we are accu&s;tomed to its chains, by length of time; or, till they are broken by the efforts of powerful rea&s;on, or, the caprice of continued vexation. The &s;econd, &s;uffers, &s;ometimes, another pa&s;&s;ion to get before it; rea&s;on and inte|re&s;t, often, hold the bridle, and, make it give way to our &s;ituation, and, affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> attaches us, &s;olely, to one per&s;on, and, delivers up our heart, without re&s;erve,
<PB N="84" REF="85">&s;o as to engage it, wholly, and, make every other object, of what beauty or merit &s;o|ever, indifferent to us. <HI>Gallantry,</HI> rivets us, generally, to all per&s;ons, who are either beautiful or agreeable, and, unites us to tho&s;e, who make the lea&s;t returns to our eagerne&s;s and de&s;ire; in &s;uch a manner, however, as leaves us no liking for others.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that <HI>love,</HI> delights in difficulties; &s;o far from being weakened by ob&s;tacles, they, generally, increa&s;e it; and, we make it one of our mo&s;t &s;erious engagements. As for <HI>gallantry,</HI> it bani&s;hes formality, is le&s;s accu&s;tomed to difficulty, and, is often entered into, merely, for amu&s;ement. It is for this rea&s;on, we ob|&s;erve more &s;pirit of <HI>gallantry</HI> in men, than <HI>love:</HI> for, it is rare to find a fir&s;t <HI>love,</HI> fol|lowed by a &s;econd; and, I doubt, whether ever it can be &s;aid, by a third: but, <HI>gal|lantries</HI> are, &s;ometimes, without number, and, &s;ucceed each other, till that age ar|rives, when their &s;ource is dried up.</P>
<P>There is, always, hone&s;ty in <HI>love;</HI> but, it is trouble&s;ome and capricious; we con|&s;ider it, now-a-days, as a di&s;temper, or, as a weakne&s;s of mind. In <HI>gallantry,</HI> there
<PB N="85" REF="86">is a degree of knavery, but, it is free and good humoured; and, is become the ta&s;te of the age.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> de&s;igns on the imagination, the flattering idea of eternal happine&s;s, in the entire and con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object we <HI>love. Gallantry,</HI> fails not to paint there the agreeable image of a &s;ingular plea&s;ure, in the enjoyment of the object we pur&s;ue; but, neither the one, nor, the other, co|pies after nature; experience &s;hewing us, that their colours, however agreeable, are, equally, deceitful. All the difference we find, is, that <HI>love,</HI> being more &s;erious, the unfaithfulne&s;s of its pencil, gives greater offence; and, the recollection of the pain it has given, in &s;eeing it &s;o ill rewarded, creates our di&s;gu&s;t; whereas, <HI>gallantry,</HI> be|ing more wanton, we are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the fallacy of its colouring, and, the vain notions we have of being arrived at the end of its de&s;igns, reconcile any di&s;appoint|ments, we may have met with.</P>
<P>In <HI>love,</HI> it is the heart, which, princi|pally, ta&s;tes the plea&s;ure; the mind, making it&s;elf a &s;lave, without any regard; and, the &s;atisfaction of the &s;en&s;es, contributing le&s;s
<PB N="86" REF="87">to the &s;weet enjoyment, than a certain con|tentedne&s;s of &s;oul, which produces the charming idea, of being in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we love, and, receiving the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible proofs of a tender return. In <HI>gal|lantry,</HI> the heart, is le&s;s affected with the object; the mind, being more free, to in|dulge it&s;elf, and the &s;en&s;es, more atten|tive to their own &s;atisfaction, partake the plea&s;ure with greater equality; voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, contributing more to its enjoyment, than the delicacy of &s;entiments.</P>
<P>When we are too much tormented by the caprices of <HI>love,</HI> we endeavour to di&s;en|tangle our&s;elves, and, become indifferent. When we are too fatigued by the exerci&s;es of <HI>gallantry,</HI> we take a re&s;olution to de&s;i&s;t, and, become &s;ober.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s makes <HI>love</HI> degenerate into jea|lou&s;y; and, <HI>gallantry,</HI> into libertini&s;m. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, we are &s;ubject, to trouble of mind; in the &s;econd, we are in danger, of de&s;troying our health.</P>

<P>The common idea of the&s;e two words, is, that of a &s;eparation made, by the force of the mind, in the con&s;ideration of ob|jects; but, difficult as it is, to find out their peculiar ideas, and, determine their re&s;pective characteri&s;tics, I have attempted it, in the be&s;t manner, I am able.</P>
<P><HI>Preci&s;ion,</HI> then, &s;eparates things, di&s;tinct in them&s;elves, in order, to prevent the confu&s;ion, which ari&s;es from a jumble of
<PB N="98" REF="99">ideas. <HI>Ab&s;traction,</HI> if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eparates things, that are in them&s;elves in&s;eparable, in order, to con&s;ider them apart, independent one of another. The fir&s;t, is the effect of the ju&s;tne&s;s, and, clearne&s;s of the under&s;tand|ing, which prevents our adding any thing, that is u&s;ele&s;s, or, foreign to the &s;ubject we treat of; con&s;equently, it will agree, in every circum&s;tance, either, with re&s;pect to affairs, or, &s;ciences. The &s;econd, is the effort of a metaphy&s;ical mind, which re|moves, from the point of view all, that we would detach from the &s;ubject; it in &s;ome re&s;pect mutilates, but, &s;ometimes, contributes to the di&s;covery of truth, and, &s;ometimes, draws it into error. We may however u&s;e it, but, with care.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that <HI>preci&s;ion,</HI> is, more applicable to things, which may not only be con&s;idered apart, but, may be con|ceived, to be one, without the other, &s;uch as, for example, alms, and, charity; and, <HI>ab&s;traction,</HI> more particularly, to things, which may indeed be con&s;idered apart, but, which cannot be conceived to
<PB N="99" REF="100">be one, without the other, as, body, and, &s;ize. Thus, the de&s;ign of <HI>preci&s;ion,</HI> is, to prevent a wandering from the &s;ubject, re|moving, for that purpo&s;e, all, that is foreign to it; and, that of <HI>ab&s;traction,</HI> to obviate our entering into the utmo&s;t ex|tent of it, con&s;idering only one part, with|out any regard to the other.</P>
<P>There is no &s;cience more certain, or, more clear than, that of geometry; it mak|ing very exact <HI>preci&s;ions:</HI> There are, how|ever, certain metaphy&s;ical <HI>ab&s;tractions,</HI> blend|ed with it, which make geometricians fall into errors, equally, with others; not in|deed when &s;ize and quantity are in que&s;ti|on, but, with re&s;pect to phy&s;ics.</P>
<P>Our ideas cannot be too <HI>preci&s;e;</HI> but, it is, &s;ometimes, dangerous, to have them too <HI>ab&s;tracted.</HI> The fir&s;t, is the &s;urer way of arriving at the truth, in &s;cience, and, our aim, in affairs; whereas, the &s;econd, often, puts us farther from both.</P>
