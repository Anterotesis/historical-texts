<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>ON the day following our &s;trength being augmented, we gave out <HI>Romeo and Juliet.</HI> I was to play Romeo and Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em Juliet, and we had a full hou&s;e; but, it &s;o happened, that when I came to the tomb &s;cene, though I had re|hear&s;ed it &s;everal times before, hav|ing nothing but the handle of an old &s;pade to force the door, I was
<PB N="6" REF="3">&s;o out of humour, that I drove at it with more violence than was re|qui&s;ite, and the whole fabric came down upon poor Juliet who lay within, and I upon the top of it; &s;he received a contu&s;ion on her fore|head, and &s;creamed as for life. The audience thinking &s;he was more hurt, than in reality &s;he was, took part in her di&s;tre&s;s, and many of them jumped upon the &s;tage to ex|tricate her from her difficulty; and when they found &s;he had a bump on her face, they very humanely ex|cu&s;ed our going on with the piece, and de&s;ired they might have the farce. It was the <HI>Mock Doctor</HI> again, and I acquitted my&s;elf with &s;uch eclat, that the accident in the play was forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4">THE next day the Mayor's lady, Mrs. Girkin, &s;ent to us to beg we would play Alexander the Great, and though it required for the proce&s;&s;ion a greater &s;tock of cloaths than our wardrobe could furni&s;h, and we made this as an excu&s;e, yet the difficulty was got over, as through her intere&s;t we were to have the u&s;e of half a dozen &s;urplices from the college, and as many ver|gers coats from the abbey, and if we wanted it, &s;he &s;aid, we &s;hould have the Mayor's mace, and the re&s;t of the <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of his office: but the <HI>gentleman</HI> who was to play Alexander (for all players, be they ever &s;o low, are gentlemen and gentlewomen;) I &s;ay, the gentle|man who was to play Alexander, ob&s;erved that the crown was not come
<PB N="8" REF="5">from the tinmans, and a man might as well attempt the character of a general, without a truncheon; as a king in proce&s;&s;ion without a crown. This want was too great to admit of any &s;ub&s;titute and the death of Alexander was obliged to be po&s;tpon|ed till a farther day.</P>
<P>WITH the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of brown pa|per and vinegar, Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em &s;oon got rid of the protuberance on her forehead, and in a day or two, we were to appear in the characters of <HI>Othello</HI> and <HI>De&s;demona;</HI> the evening came, and the hou&s;e was again as full as it could hold. Seldom a night we played, but &s;ome awkward accident occurred, that made the audi|ence laugh as much at a tragedy, as at the drolle&s;t farce we could perform,
<PB N="9" REF="6">and I verily believe, the hopes of &s;uch accidents, drew more to the theatre than any real inclination to &s;ee the piece; and fortune, &s;ome how or other, concurred to be of u&s;e to us in this particular. I had blacked my face for the character of the Moor, and, finding the hou&s;e full, was in the be&s;t of &s;pirits, and my De&s;demona looking more lovely than I had ever &s;een her; having never rehear&s;ed the part with my face blacked, I forgot my&s;elf, and when I was to embrace her, I could not re&s;i&s;t ki&s;&s;ing her with fervency; the misfortune was, the black came off from my face upon her's, the hou&s;e laughed immoderately, and &s;he was &s;o mortified, that &s;he gave me &s;uch a back-handed &s;lap on the face, as &s;et my mouth a bleeding: the
<PB N="10" REF="7">hou&s;e was in roar of applau&s;e, and nothing was heard from all parts of it, but <HI>encore, encore,</HI></P>
<P>I MENTION the&s;e occurrences as the only matters worthy ob&s;ervation in &s;uch a vagabond company as I had the honour to belong to. If it hurt our reputation, it however filled our pockets, for the nights I played, I &s;eldom divided le&s;s than between four and five pounds.</P>
<P>IN a very few days, the crown was completed and the play of Alexander given out; but Mrs. Mayore&s;s, having &s;prained her an|cle, could not po&s;&s;ibly be pre&s;ent; it was lucky, indeed, that &s;he <HI>had</HI> &s;prained her ancle, as &s;he would have been di&s;appointed in the performance.
<PB N="11" REF="8">Alexander the Great had; the night before, drank too many libations to the god Bacchus, at the ale-hou&s;e where he &s;pent the evening; had quarreled with &s;ome of the company, and had beat one man very much. The con&s;equence was, that he got a warrant from the Mayor, and ju&s;t as the piece was going to begin, a con&s;table found his way behind the &s;cenes, &s;eized Alexander by the collar, and took him away in his royal robes to Mr. Girkin's ju&s;tice-room, with a whole mob behind him, and on Mrs. Girkin's enquiring who all that rabble was below; his wor&s;hip told her, with a degree of plea&s;antry, <Q>That, as &s;he was too lame to go to the play-&s;hop; Alexander the Great with his body guards was come
<PB N="12" REF="9">to play the part at her hou&s;e.</Q> In &s;hort, this unlucky circum&s;tance obliged us to apologize to the audi|ence for changing the piece, and an|other was exhibited in its room.</P>
<P>THE mayor, in his time, had been a gallant &s;park, and a great ad|mirer of the ladies, and though he was now on the verge of &s;ixty, he had &s;omehow or other been &s;mitten by the cupids in Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em's eyes, and longed for nothing &s;o much as a tete-a-tete with her; but the dif|ficulty was how to &s;ee her, and not fall under the ob&s;ervation of his wife, who, when her re&s;entment was rou&s;ed, was one of the greate&s;t vi|ragos in the city of Winche&s;ter. He had once expre&s;&s;ed an inclination that Mrs. Girkin would a&s;k Mi&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="10">Sla&s;h'em &s;ome afternoon to tea. <Q>Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em to tea! Invite a vagabond player to <HI>our</HI> hou&s;e to tea!</Q> exclaimed Mrs. Girkin. <Q>Sure man, you mu&s;t be out of your &s;en&s;es!&mdash;What's become of all your <HI>dignity,</HI> Mr. Girkin? What, do you think, the ladies of our corporation would &s;ay, were they to hear of &s;uch a thing?&mdash;We &s;hould be the je&s;t of the whole city.</Q> This Mr. May|or told Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, one after|noon at her lodgings, and &s;he told it to me again; for, finding his wife would not receive her, he found a way to invite him&s;elf to the ob|ject of his wi&s;hes, by waiting on Biddy Sla&s;h'em with a pre&s;ent of a &s;mall jar of pickles, as an acknow|ledgement, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay,
<PB N="14" REF="11">for the entertainment &s;he had afford|ed him at the play-&s;hop. Biddy, who I found was always open-hand|ed, more ready to receive, than people to give, and nothing &s;eeming to come ami&s;s to her, encouraged the mayor's vi&s;its, as &s;he had done tho&s;e of the linen-draper's apprentice at St. Albans, and indeed, he was there oftener than it was convenient or agreeable to <HI>me.</HI> He u&s;ed to vi|&s;it her in the evenings we did not perform, under a pretence of going to a new e&s;tabli&s;hed club. But his wife &s;u&s;pected him, had him traced and found out his haunts.</P>
<P>ONE morning at breakfa&s;t with Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, &s;he gave me the fol|lowing account of the la&s;t of the mayor's vi&s;its. <Q>The evening be|fore
<PB N="15" REF="12">la&s;t,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>he tapped at my door, calling in an under voice,</Q> <Q>my dear Biddy, are you alone?</Q> <Q>I told him I was, and he waddled in with a bottle of Lucca olives in his hand, which he &s;aid, he brought for my own eat|ing; they were ju&s;t imported and &s;ome of the be&s;t of the kind&mdash; he begged for a plate that he might &s;how me how good they were. I handed a plate and he turned half of them out, for the bottle held but a pint. Few as there were, he fell voraciou&s;ly to work, and would &s;carce give me an opportunity of ta&s;ting them. I put one into my mouth out of complai&s;ance, and indeed <HI>but</HI> one, as 'tis a fruit I am not very fond of. He a&s;ked me to take
<PB N="16" REF="13">another, but I told him, I never eat &s;uch things in an afternoon; he a&s;ked me no more, but devoured the whole of them him&s;elf, whil&s;t he was with me, prai&s;ing them all the time.</Q></P>
<P>SHE paid me the compliment to &s;ay, that &s;he often wi&s;hed him away, as &s;he expected me; but &s;he could not get rid of him, and he kept tea&s;ing her the whole evening. <Q>Often would he break out into fits of exta&s;y, &s;queezing my hand,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>or pre&s;&s;ing my knees, with,</Q> <Q>Thou, dear little charming crea|ture!</Q>&mdash;<Q>and then to the olives again, with</Q> <Q>They are very fine fruit&mdash;I brought them purely for your own eating.</Q> <Q>He &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>his own;</HI> for, as
<PB N="17" REF="14">I ob&s;erved before, he devoured the whole of them.</Q> <Q>At la&s;t,</Q> &s;ays Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, <Q>I heard &s;ome one coming up &s;tairs,</Q> for her apartment communicated with the pa&s;&s;age, and that with the &s;treet; and the mayor was exceedingly alarmed le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;cover|ed: <Q>for he told me,</Q> continued &s;he, <Q>that if his coming to me was known to his wife, he &s;hould never hear the la&s;t of it. He tri|ed to get under the bed.</Q> Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em had but one room, and the bed &s;tood at the farther end of it. <Q>He tried,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>to get under the bed, but his belly was too big, and it was impracticable. I then pointed to a &s;mall clo&s;et and hurried him into it; but it was &s;o &s;hallow, that the door
<PB N="18" REF="15">would not &s;hut clo&s;e, and he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding tip|toe, and holding it to. Having thus concealed him, I opened the chamber door to a per&s;on that knocked, conceiving it to be you, but I was di&s;appointed; it was a woman tolerably well dre&s;&s;ed, about the age of forty, and in corpulency pretty nearly as big as the mayor; her face was as red as the gills of a turkey cock, and &s;he &s;eemed to be out of breath with a&s;cending the &s;tairs. She a&s;ked, if my name was <HI>Sla&s;h'em,</HI> and on my telling her, it was, apologi&s;ed for the abrupt vi&s;it &s;he had made me, but that her peace of mind was at &s;take, and &s;he hoped I would excu&s;e it. She &s;aid, her name was <HI>Girkin.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="19" REF="16">I was a good deal alarmed at this, as I feared a di&s;covery and dread|ed the con&s;equences, for &s;he &s;eem|ed to be a violent one.</Q> <Q>Mi&s;s Sha&s;h'em,</Q> &s;ays Mrs. Girkin, throwing her&s;elf into a great armed chair, <Q>have you &s;een my hu&s;band lately?</Q> <Q>Madam,</Q> replied I, <Q>I am a &s;tranger to your hu&s;band, and &s;hould not know him, was I to &s;ee him.</Q> <Q>Then, you are great|ly belied,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>for I under|&s;tand he vi&s;its this hou&s;e often.</Q> <Q>If that be the ca&s;e,</Q> returned I, <Q>his vi&s;its mu&s;t be to &s;ome per&s;on below or above, for the hou&s;e is full of lodgers&mdash;it cannot be to <HI>me.</HI></Q> <Q>I beg your pardon,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>if I do you wrong; but you mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, my hu&s;band, Mr. Girkin&mdash;that is
<PB N="20" REF="17">Mr. Mayor, though an old man, is a very wicked old man; nothing that wears a cap can e&s;cape him; I can't keep a maid &s;ervant for him; he is always pulling and hawling them about; and all to no purpo&s;e; if you knew as much as I know, you'd be of my way of thinking; there is not a trull that comes into the &s;hop for a half penny worth of vinegar, or a farthing's worth of matches, that he is not leering at, and to his <HI>ternal</HI> di&s;grace. He is a <HI>gentleman,</HI> Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, a ju&s;tice of the king's peace, and a man of <HI>dignity;</HI> and he owes it all to me; for, if I had not in&s;i&s;ted upon his taking up his freedom, he would never have been Mayor of Winche&s;ter now; nor &s;hould we ever have
<PB N="21" REF="18">been re&s;pected, as we are: but I'll expo&s;e the wretch, I'll let the cor|poration know&mdash;they take him to be a man of &s;en&s;e, but, between you and me, there is not a great|er fool under heaven.&mdash;When there is any thing in the <HI>ju&s;ticing</HI> way going on, I am always ob|liged to help out; but, I would not have him know I &s;aid &s;o, on any account, for we may as well keep peace at home if one can; that makes me keep it a &s;ecret; and I look upon you, Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, to be a lady of too much honour to tell it again.</Q> <Q>I told her, &s;he might rely upon me, that nothing &s;he had &s;aid &s;hould tran&s;pire. At this moment the olive bottle &s;truck her eye, as it &s;tood upon the mantle-piece. She took hold
<PB N="22" REF="19">of it, &s;aid &s;he knew that bottle, and he mu&s;t have been with me this afternoon, for that the bottle came from her &s;hop, and that within the&s;e two hours, as the hamper that contained them, was ju&s;t brought to their hou&s;e, and had &s;carce been opened: &s;o that I am &s;ure I am right, and doubt whether he is not concealed &s;ome where in the room now; ca&s;t|ing here eyes round the chamber. &mdash;I a&s;&s;ured her it was all con|jecture.</Q> <Q>Don't di&s;&s;emble Mi&s;s 'Sla&s;h'em,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, reddening with anger, <Q>don't tell me a lie; it's a &s;hame for any woman to encourage another woman's hu&s;band, as you have done mine. Mr. Girkin is a poor mean-&s;pirited wretch, or he'd be above conde&s;cending to
<PB N="23" REF="20">come into the lodgings of a va|gabond actre&s;s and &s;trolling &s;trum|pet.</Q> <Q>I de&s;ired her, if &s;he did not know how to behave her&s;elf, to leave my room; for I could not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be in&s;ulted to my face. At this &s;he grew more angry &s;till, abu&s;ed her hu&s;band in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms, called me a prevaricating hu&s;&s;ey&mdash;&s;aid, that &s;trolling players were a nui&s;ance to every place they came into&mdash; and that &s;he would take care to have us all &s;ent to pri&s;on: in &s;hort, &s;he &s;tormed &s;o loud and made &s;uch a riot as brought up the fa|mily from belowl. They endea|voured to pacify her, but all to no purpo&s;e: &s;he was told, &s;he &s;aid, he came into the hou&s;e but a little before her, and, from the
<PB N="24" REF="21">olive bottle, &s;he was &s;ure he was not far off at that moment. Mr. Gir|kin hearing this, and endeavouring, by ri&s;ing higher on his toes, to pull the clo&s;et door clo&s;er, lo&s;t his equi|librium, and tumbled forward right into the room, throwing down a chair on which a chamber-pot &s;tood, which the ladies had, during this conver&s;ation, made u&s;e of, and broke it into a thou&s;and pieces. At this accident, &s;he got up in the utmo&s;t fury;</Q> cried, <Q>now the murder's out:</Q> <Q>&s;he kicked him &s;everal times, and gave her tongue full play.</Q> <Q>A pretty figure truly,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>for the mayor of a town! Ar'n't you <HI>a&s;hamed,</HI> you &s;neaking fool&mdash;to &s;ee your&s;elf &s;o expo&s;ed? Is this your <HI>dignity?</HI> &mdash;What will the corporation &s;ay;
<PB N="25" REF="22">for I'll take care to have it known throughout the city?&mdash;Is this the return I'm to have, for all my pains to make a <HI>gentleman</HI> of you?</Q>&mdash; <Q>Not a word could &s;he get from him; at which &s;he picked up his hat with one hand, and his cane with the other, and laid on upon him with both, &s;o unmercifully, that the poor henpecked devil could e&s;cape only by flight. He made the be&s;t of his way down the &s;tairs, and &s;he after him, and I thus got rid of my company altogether.</Q></P>
<P>MISS Sla&s;h'em a&s;ked me, if I had heard of it from any one but her. Not &s;o particularly, replied I, as you have related it; but the greater part of the &s;tory is in every one's
<PB N="26" REF="23">mouth, and his wor&s;hip is &s;o much laughed at, that he dare not &s;hew his face abroad. There is a variety of tales re&s;pecting it. One is, that he was found in bed with you; an|other, that you concealed him in the bed; another, that Mrs. Gir|kin threw the chamber-pot at his head; another, that he was not di&s;|covered at all, but made his e&s;cape out of a back window upon a &s;hed beneath it; and as &s;tories never lo&s;e by carrying, it is &s;aid, that his weight carried him through that &s;hed, and that he fell right into a water tub below. In &s;hort, there are always as many &s;tories as there are per&s;ons to tell it; for &s;o happy are mo&s;t people at invention, that they generally add &s;ome little of their own; &s;o that if you hear a
<PB N="27" REF="24">&s;tory at a tenth or twelfth hand, the &s;purious tale bears no re&s;em|blance to its original.&mdash;But the wor&s;t &s;tory, my dear Biddy, &s;ays I, is, that an order is come down this morning from the mayor, not to perform any more under the peril of commitment. I have no doubt but its Mrs. Girkin's doings, but that's of little con&s;equence to us. The manager is gone to the mayor to &s;ee what can be done, and if his application proves ineffectual, we mu&s;t pack up and begone.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING would do; the may|or told our manager, that is to &s;ay, Mrs. Girkin told him for her hu&s;band, that he had tried us, and found we were a parcel of idle, noi&s;y vagrants, and would not &s;uf|fer us to perform any more, and that we mu&s;t troop off. As there was no alternative, it was propo&s;ed to move to the Devizes; with re|&s;pect
<PB N="29" REF="26">to my&s;elf, as I had played the fool too long, I re&s;olved to quit them. I was ma&s;ter of more than twenty pounds, and determined to go for London, where I might have a chance of once more &s;eeing Mi&s;s Wildman. I accordingly commu|nicated my intentions to the mana|ger, took my leave of Mi&s;s Sla&s;h|'em, wi&s;hed them better &s;ucce&s;s at the next place, and in a day or two after arrived in the metropolis.</P>
<P>I TOOK a lodging in a cheap part of the town, and before I &s;ettled up|on any plan, I went into the neigh|bourhood of Berkeley Square, en|quired for the family of the Wild|mans, and was informed, that Mr. Wildman had left his hou&s;e three
<PB N="30" REF="27">years ago, and retired to his &s;eat in the north, and that his daughter, it was reported, was &s;ince married to a foreign gentleman. I don't know that any thing hurt me more for the pre&s;ent moment; I was for tearing off her ring, which had been con&s;tantly on my finger, ever &s;ince I had received it; but, on reflection, was led to hope, that this report, as thou&s;ands of others are, was groundle&s;s, and it would be folly to act ra&s;hly, and wi&s;er to re&s;t content|ed, till I had an opportunity of be|ing better informed.</P>
<P>TIRED with a life of &s;ervitude, and being under the controul of any one, I re&s;olved to continue my own ma&s;ter as long as I could; I there|fore determined to turn author; but as
<PB N="31" REF="28">my pur&s;e was not very deep, and it was expen&s;ive living in London, I could not wait for the completion of any elaborate or voluminous work, but found it nece&s;&s;ary to write for the pre&s;ent moment, and turn my thoughts to the temporary matter of the day. Be&s;ides, however enabled I might have been to have waited till I could have completed &s;ome work of credit, I found my&s;elf di&s;|inclined, from the poor encourage|ment authors meet with. Elabo|rate performances are encouraged, only as the &s;ciences, which is in an in|ver&s;e ratio to their utility. An opera dancer will gain more money annually, than all the profe&s;&s;ors of a univer&s;ity together, and the wages of an expert hair-dre&s;&s;er, or a good cook, will double tho&s;e of a pre|ceptor
<PB N="32" REF="29">ceptor, let that preceptor be who he will. Politics, then, was my theme, and as I found it was the temper of the times to rail at admini&s;tration, right or wrong, I &s;et out upon the &s;ame principle; I accordingly wrote a paper in oppo&s;ition to government, arraigned the conduct of the fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, &s;hewed in a variety of arguments that he was ha&s;tening the downfall of this na|tion, when, in fact, I thought the contrary; and when I had complet|ed it, I entitled it <HI>the Flogger.</HI> Having copied it fair, and in a very legible hand, I read it over to my|&s;elf twenty times, and was &s;o well &s;atified with my production, that I concluded I &s;hould not only get a great deal of money by it, but

<PB N="35" REF="32">that very well, but there's no|thing to be done in our way without danger. The literary age is pa&s;t and gone; and, if it was not for Newgate, pillory and the like, a book&s;eller now would hardly get bread to eat: no, no, friend, you mu&s;t never &s;et up for an author, if you're afraid of your ears;&mdash;I have made, thank God, a pretty &s;nug fortune, but it was not without a great deal of dan|ger.</Q> In &s;hort, I found nothing was to be done with him; of cour&s;e, left him and applied to another; a man not quite &s;o violent as the la&s;t; he de&s;ired me to leave it, till the next morning, and he would then give me an an&s;wer.&mdash;I called as he directed me, and was told it would not &s;uit him, for there was
<PB N="36" REF="33">nothing more in it than a man might read every day in the new&s;papers at little or no expence. In &s;hort, that I had taken the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and &s;hould only get into the pillory for my pains.</P>
<P>As I was convinced that &s;tanding in a pillory was the readie&s;t way to get pen&s;ioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. S&mdash;, was &s;o puni&s;hed for a libel.</NOTE>, it did not di&s;cou|rage me; I returned to my lodging, wrote it afre&s;h, and threw as much libel into it, as the little libeller had recommended; I carried it to him again, but I could not per&s;uade him to look at it. Thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, I took it to a third, and on reading &s;ome few lines, he di&s;covered enough
<PB N="37" REF="34">to tell me, that he valued his quiet at too great a rate, to embark in faction and trea&s;on, and that if I was wi&s;e, I would put in into the fire.</P>
<P>WHAT to do now I could not tell. I took it to an ob&s;cure printer, who I knew would print any thing for money: he read it, and told me, if I could find any one to publi&s;h it, he was &s;ure it would have a rapid &s;ale; for that he had not &s;een more libel and trea&s;on in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s for a long time. I was convinced I had &s;teered clear of the la&s;t; and as to the fir&s;t, I thought little about it. I a&s;ked him if he would print it for me, and what it would co&s;t: he told me it would make a &s;heet and a half in &s;mall folio, which would &s;ell for three-pence, and that
<PB N="38" REF="35">five hundred of them would co&s;t about two guineas, which, if &s;old, would produce four pounds ten &s;hil|lings. I re&s;olved to run the ri&s;k of this &s;um; and as parliament was &s;itting, determined to be the &s;eller of them my&s;elf. He told me he could keep the pre&s;s &s;tanding, and if I found a demand for them, a &s;econd five hundred would not co&s;t me above twenty-&s;even &s;hillings. He &s;aid he had a &s;tall in a very great thoroughfare, where I might &s;ay they were to be had; and he would recommend me poor decrepid old woman to &s;ell them, whom no one would think it worth while to trou|ble upon the occa&s;ion; that I might give her her &s;tory; and &s;he might ac|knowledge her&s;elf to be both author and printer; that I need nor be &s;een in
<PB N="39" REF="36">the bu&s;ine&s;s, but that I might call as another cu&s;tomer, two or three times a day, and take her money as &s;he &s;old them; and that the cu&s;tom|ary allowance I mu&s;t make to the trade, was any book&s;eller to be the publi&s;her, would be &s;ufficient to pay every expence; and at the &s;ame time I &s;hould be certain of receiving my money, which might not be the ca&s;e if I put them out of my own hands. <Q>Be&s;ides,</Q> continues he, <Q>you are not aware of the frauds of the&s;e men. If you give a book|&s;eller a work to get printed, and conclude upon an edition of five hundred; they will order &s;even hundred and fifty, or perhaps more, to be printed, call all above five hundred their own, &s;ell all the&s;e their own fir&s;t, and account
<PB N="40" REF="37">with you for the remainder. I knew a dignitary of the church, who&s;e &s;ermon, preached before the Hou&s;e of Commons, was ordered to be printed; a certain book&s;eller in Fleet-Street was the publi&s;her; and from the compliments the author received at court, and other places, he had every rea&s;on to think a great number had been &s;old. One &s;ays,</Q> <Q>I have been richly enter|tained, Doctor, with your &s;ermon this morning.</Q> Another, <Q>I have been in clo&s;e conver&s;e with you all the fore part of this day.</Q> Ano|ther, <Q>I have but ju&s;t quitted you, and here you are again.</Q> <Q>In &s;hort, ten or a dozen friends had given him to under&s;tand, they had purcha&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e; and when he came to &s;ettle the account with
<PB N="41" REF="38">his book&s;eller, to his great mor|tification and &s;urprize, only three copies had been &s;old.</Q> Rogues, they &s;ay, are hone&s;t to each other, but not, we find, among this tribe of men. A printer once told me, that two book&s;ellers jointly bought a manu&s;cript, and agreed that one thou&s;and copies &s;hould be printed, and be divided between them. He who furni&s;hed the paper, &s;ent in &s;ufficient for one thou&s;and two hun|dred and fifty, and reque&s;ted an extra two hundred and fifty might be printed off, and laid by for him, unknown to the other. The printer, an hone&s;t man, made no reply, but determined not to do it. However, a day or two after, the other book|&s;eller &s;ent in paper for two hundred and fifty copies, and begged a &s;imi|lar
<PB N="42" REF="39">favour. He now re&s;olved to profit by the&s;e ra&s;cals, worked off the two hundred and fifty extra for each, put them both on a footing, and afforded them the &s;ecret &s;atis|faction of thinking they had cheated each other.</P>
<P>ALL this &s;eemed &s;o fea&s;ible, that I was bent upon trying the experi|ment, and being my own publi&s;her. Five hundred were printed, the &s;tall &s;upplied, and the old woman ap|pointed to &s;ell them at three-pence each: and that they might fall into the hands of the great, I dre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf in &s;ome old cloaths I borrowed of the printer's devil, put a patch upon one of my eyes, &s;uch a wig upon my head, as &s;hoe-blacks in London &s;treets wipe &s;hoes with, and
<PB N="43" REF="40">with an apron tucked up before me, I took two hundred of them to the parliament hou&s;e, and as the mem|bers went in or came out, I bawl|ed out, <Q>The Flogger, an plea&s;e your honours; the mo&s;t &s;pirited paper that ever was publi&s;hed, your honours!</Q> This an&s;wer|ed my purpo&s;e; they laughed at the conceit; &s;ome would give me a blow, in good humour, with their canes; but they mo&s;t of them purcha&s;ed; and in&s;tead of three-pence, none gave me le&s;s than &s;ixpence, mo&s;t of them a &s;hil|ling, and &s;ome few half a crown, for my oddity. In &s;hort, I &s;old them to the la&s;t paper, and got upwards of &s;even pounds for the two hundred. On my return to my &s;hop, I found very few were &s;old. But the next
<PB N="44" REF="41">day the Hou&s;e of Commons did me the honour to e&s;tabli&s;h its &s;ale; for it was re&s;olved to be the mo&s;t atro|cious libel that ever was publi&s;hed; and it was moved and carried, that the publi&s;her of the &s;aid <HI>Flogger</HI> &s;hould be taken into cu&s;tody, and that the attorney general &s;hould pro|&s;ecute. This being made public the next day, I took care to have it in all the new&s;papers where the &s;aid libel was &s;old; and &s;uch was the demand for it, that we could not print fa&s;t enough. Sixteen thou&s;and of them were &s;old in the fir&s;t week, by which I cleared upwards of fifty pounds. So much encouragement urged me to proceed; and the week following, I wrote a &s;econd paper, if po&s;&s;ible, more virulent than the fir&s;t, and it &s;old equally well. The King's
<PB N="45" REF="42">me&s;&s;engers were after the author and publi&s;her. They called at the &s;tall where the&s;e papers were &s;old; and the following was the dialogue be|tween the old woman and them; the old lady drawling out her an|&s;wers, as if &s;hew as faint, and almo&s;t dying.</P>

<P>I NO &s;ooner landed at Calais, but I found my heart at ea&s;e, and that weight upon my &s;pirits, which had for &s;ome time oppre&s;&s;ed me, in|&s;tantly taken off. So nece&s;&s;ary an in|gredient is con&s;cious rectitute to a man's happine&s;s! I &s;poke little or no French, though I under&s;tood it tolerably well, of cour&s;e was oblig|ed to put up at Engli&s;h hou&s;es, where they were exceedingly extorti|onate. You no &s;ooner arrive in Ca|lais
<PB N="50" REF="47">harbour, than the waiters from the different hotels or inns are ready to tear the cloaths of your back, in order to prevail on you to go to the hou&s;e to which they belong, and no &s;ooner are you &s;afely lodged with|in their hou&s;e; but, they &s;eem in|different whether they &s;ee you after that time or not. I remember I put up at the Table Royal, and among other unrea&s;onable charges, was thirty-&s;ix &s;ols, or near nineteen pence of our money for reading an Engli&s;h new&s;paper, and on my re|mon&s;trating again&s;t the charge, they gave me to under&s;tand, that though I wore the appearance of a gentle|man, I did not act like one. The comparative cheapne&s;s of wines and provi&s;ions in this part of the world, to what it is with us, leads Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="51" REF="48">travellers to &s;pend their money freely, and this &s;eeming liberality, has &s;poiled the publicans upon all their roads; and where they will charge a native but one livre, that is, ten pence half penny, they will make an Engli&s;hman pay three. I was long enough abroad to find all this out, and therefore made a point of going to hou&s;es unac|cu&s;tomed to receive the Engli&s;h; where if I did not dine according to our mode of eating, I had the &s;a|tisfaction to have my dinner at one third of the price. Indeed, I found the di&s;po&s;ition of taking an advan|tage of foreigners &s;o general, that travelling in company with &s;ome German officers in the &s;ervice of the French, they reque&s;ted me to let <HI>them</HI> &s;ettle the bills as they pa&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="52" REF="49">otherwi&s;e, very unrea&s;onable charges would be made; this I chearfully acquie&s;ced with; but di&s;covered I derived no advantage from their cautious conduct, for, I was &s;uffici|ently well acquainted with their money, to know, that in &s;ettling my quota of the &s;um expended, they took care to make me pay double what they did them&s;elves, and of cour&s;e they paid le&s;s than they would have done, had I not been of the party. It was a matter I found a difficulty of yielding to; but, as I did not care to enter into a di&s;pute, in which I might come off the wor&s;t, I &s;ubmitted for the little time I was with them to the impo&s;ition; and you will always find this the wi&s;er &s;tep. In whatever part of the world you are, go as quiet|ly
<PB N="53" REF="50">through it as you can, and if you chance to &s;tumble over a &s;tone, dont quarrel with it, but pur&s;ue your way, and rejoice that it did not break your leg.</P>
<P>BEING abroad in a foreign country without recommendation, and with|out any intention of continuing long, I thought of little but looking about me and &s;eeing what naturally pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view. I wan|dered from Dunkirk to Bruges, and from Bruges to Ghent; and being one Sunday morning at the chapel of the convent of the Rich Dames in that city, during high ma&s;s, I heard a &s;hriek in the gallery among the nuns, which rather di&s;turbed the ceremony for the moment; but
<PB N="54" REF="51">as all was &s;oon quiet again, I took no farther notice of it.</P>
<P>ABOUT nine o'clock in the even|ing, however, as I was &s;itting down to &s;upper, at the St. Seba&s;tian, in this town, the ma&s;ter of the hotel came into the room, and a&s;ked me if my name was not <HI>Outca&s;t;</HI> if it was, a man below had a letter for me. The novelty of the circum|&s;tance, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I had no acquaintance that could know me in my pre&s;ent garb, for I was very &s;martly dre&s;&s;ed, at fir&s;t alarmed me; but as I had done no wrong, I had not much to dread. Having, therefore, ordered the per&s;on to be &s;ent up &s;tairs, I enquired from whom he came. <Q>If you are an Engli&s;h

<P>HAVING found Flanders, by all accounts that I had received, to be a country of intrigue, I concluded this to be a bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ame kind. However, I impatiently waited for the hour of a&s;&s;ignation at the Rich Dames, and was there by the time the clock &s;truck eleven. I enquired for &s;i&s;ter Agatha, and was &s;hewn up into a parlour, where I had not been five minutes, before, I was, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, tran&s;ported with the &s;ight of my dear Mi&s;s Wildman, who &s;eemed as much confu&s;ed as my&s;elf, and was unable to utter a word. She put her hand through
<PB N="58" REF="55">the grate, on which I imprinted a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es; and when I was able to &s;peak, I told her, the happi|ne&s;s of meeting her where I &s;o little expected to &s;ee her, totally overcame me. She &s;aid &s;he was no le&s;s rejoiced on her part; that &s;he had encoun|tered a deal of trouble on my account; that &s;he was anxious to know where I had been, and how I was circum|&s;tanced, and the rea&s;on &s;he had never heard from me: in &s;hort, &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ay a thou&s;and things to me, which her &s;ituation prevented, but which &s;he hoped I would give her &s;ome opportunity of doing. I &s;hewed her the ring, which, in her gra|cious moments, &s;he had been plea&s;ed to give me, declared it had never been off my finger, and that for the many years I had lo&s;t &s;ight of her,
<PB N="59" REF="56">&s;he had been ever in my thoughts. I fixed my eyes on her during the&s;e declarations, and &s;aw the lovely tears trickle fa&s;t down her cheeks, and was &s;en&s;ible of all her emotions. She appeared as amiable in my eyes as ever; and if her mona&s;tic dre&s;s made any alteration in her form, it was that of rendering her far more lovely. I gave her to under|&s;tand, that I was &s;till a &s;ingle man, and as much attached to her as ever, and that I dreaded to hear her &s;tory, le&s;t the chapter of accidents &s;hould have placed her beyond my reach. When &s;he had recovered her&s;elf, &s;he told me &s;he was not yet profe&s;&s;ed, of cour&s;e not &s;eque&s;tered for life; that her endeavouring to &s;earch me out, was a te&s;t of the &s;tate of her mind; and that on a pre&s;umption
<PB N="60" REF="57">&s;he &s;hould find me as honourable as ever, &s;he had written a few lines, which &s;he would &s;ubmit to my con|&s;ideration, on my return to my lodg|ings: that the watchful eyes of the ladies in that hou&s;e made it nece&s;|&s;ary &s;he &s;hould not continue long at the grates; but that if I would excu&s;e her leaving me &s;o abruptly, &s;he would be happy to give me a &s;econd meeting the next morning, at the &s;ame hour, and at the &s;ame place. Unwilling as I was to part with her, I was forced to &s;ubmit. She, however, gave me her hand again to ki&s;s, and I retired with my heart in my mouth, unable to utter another word.</P>
<P>I WAS no &s;ooner without the walls of the convent, than I broke open the &s;eal, and found the contents of her letter as follows:</P>

<P>You cannot have forgotten our mutual vows of attachment. Though your heart may be e&s;|tranged in the cour&s;e of time from me, mine is as true as ever. Many an unhappy hour have I &s;uffered, to pre&s;erve my vow in|violable, and many a di&s;tre&s;s have I experienced on your account. What could have prevented your writing to me as you promi&s;ed? Or is it in the nature of men to trifle with us women? Having refu&s;ed to marry a gentleman of my father's recommending, is the occa&s;ion of my being here, where had I not chanced to have &s;een you in the chapel on Sunday la&s;t, I &s;hould e're long have taken the veil; but, now all my former

I have unfortunately lo&s;t my mother, and by her death an e&s;tate of three hundred pounds a year devolves to me; but, my father withholds it from me, and it is by his injunctions that I am in this convent. Far from being inclined to a mona&s;tic life, I wi&s;h to be out of it, and if you are in any &s;ituation to maintain me, and will take me from it, I will throw my&s;elf under your protec|tion, and wait the re&s;ult of better fortune to befriend your di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed</P>

<P><PB N="63" REF="60">
ENRAPTURED with the contents of this letter, I was impatient for a &s;econd interview. The next morn|ing I &s;aw her again, opened my whole heart to her, made her ac|quainted with my &s;ituation, and concerted means to get her off. I told her, if &s;he would direct me how to act, I would implicitly fol|low her directions; that I would take the matrimonial vow the fir&s;t opportunity that offered, according to the ritual of the Roman church, and would ratify it at the altar of our own, as &s;oon as I &s;et foot in England. We then entered on the mode of her e&s;cape, and the plan &s;he pointed out was this. <Q>Here is,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>in wax, an im|pre&s;&s;ion of the garden key, which was accidentally left in the door
<PB N="64" REF="61">by &s;ome workmen, who are now within the convent, and which I found means to procure; get one made by it, and al&s;o &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary articles of dre&s;s as I have &s;et down in this paper, and when all things are prepared, I will meet you at the garden gate, an hour before matins on any morning you &s;hall appoint.</Q> I ap|proved her plan, and put it im|mediately into execution. A few days compleated the whole, and having ordered a carriage to wait at the corner of the &s;treet adjoining the convent, about two o'clock one morning, according to appoint|ment, when all was hu&s;hed and quiet, I met her at the garden gate, threw a long cloak and hood over her, locked the gate again, to pre|vent
<PB N="65" REF="62">&s;u&s;picion, and conducted her to the chai&s;e, in which we made the be&s;t of our way to Li&s;le, a town in French Flanders, and out of the reach of the police of Brabant. We were got &s;ome miles from Ghent, before I could prevail on her to &s;peak to me; at la&s;t, &s;he looked round upon me, gave me her hand, and with a &s;igh exclaimed.&mdash;<Q>How ra&s;hly, my dear Gabriel, do young women act! I fear you will your|&s;elf de&s;pi&s;e me for my conduct!</Q> I &s;oon quieted her on that head, a&s;&s;ured her it was the be&s;t proof of her affection &s;he could give me, and that I tru&s;ted &s;he would have no cau&s;e to repent it.&mdash;We met with no interruption on the road, and by nine o'clock in the morning found our&s;elves at Li&s;le. As &s;oon
<PB N="66" REF="63">as we alighted at the Auberge, I &s;ent for the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, made her a confidante in the affair, and whil&s;t my Eliza was dre&s;&s;ing, de&s;ired a prie&s;t might be &s;ent for, in order to di&s;charge my con&s;cience. An hour and a half did the bu&s;ine&s;s, her trunk was opened, and the mai|tre&s;&s;e d'hotel a&s;&s;i&s;ted at her toilette. The dre&s;s &s;he had directed was a white lute&s;tring with a pale yellow petticoat, and &s;o fa&s;hionably was it made, &s;o well put on, and her head &s;o elegantly decorated, that I was more in love with her than ever. The whole family was pre&s;ent at the ceremony of our e&s;pou&s;als, and I was ble&s;&s;ed with the riche&s;t gift, in my opinion, which heaven had to give.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="64">AFTER dinner we pur&s;ued our way to St. Omer's, where I took a lodging and &s;pent two months in an uninterrupted &s;tate of happine&s;s. As we heard nothing from Ghent, and was not enquired after; I ap|prehend it was never known what route we took.</P>
<P>HAVING given my Eliza a faith|ful detail of my adventures, which &s;he acknowledged were the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;he had heard of, in &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace of time; at my reque&s;t one afternoon, &s;he gave the following account of her&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<Q><P>THE accident that happened at our hou&s;e, filled the whole family with confu&s;ion; but my father's receipt of your letter unveiled the my&s;tery. Our porter, who was only &s;tunned with the blow you gave him, &s;oon recovered, and on being taken before a magi&s;trate, con|fe&s;&s;ed that he had been bribed
<PB N="69" REF="66">by an agent of Lord B&mdash;, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;eizing you, in order to &s;end you on board a &s;hip and convey you to &s;ome di&s;tant place from whence you might not re|turn. He was committed till &s;uch time as the coroner had &s;at on the man you killed, but the inque&s;t having brought in their verdict <HI>killed in &s;elf-defence,</HI> and you not being found to pro&s;ecute, he was di&s;charged. My father, however, took him into the hou&s;e no more; and to do him ju&s;tice, was very anxious to have all the parties puni&s;hed. He valued you for the good office you had done his daughter, and was very de|&s;irous of revenging your cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="67">THE affair, however, was &s;oon forgotten, and as you was not to be heard of, Lord B. wi&s;hed for leave to renew his addre&s;&s;es; you are acquainted with my &s;enti|ments on that &s;ubject, and my father was no le&s;s aver&s;e to it: he endeavoured to make it appear, that his ra&s;hne&s;s was a proof of the &s;trong affection he bore me; but it was li&s;tened to by neither of us: my mother commended my determination, and my father, as the propo&s;ed &s;ettlements could not be made, was not to be brought over. Lord B. however, was importunate, and his vi&s;its, though unwelcome, were &s;o fre|quent at our hou&s;e, that my fa|ther thought proper to retire to his &s;eat in the north: where,
<PB N="71" REF="68">in a &s;hort time after, my mother died; by who&s;e death, as I told you, I am entitled to an e&s;tate of three hundred pounds a year, but which my father has never given me the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</P></Q>
<P><Q>WE had not been two years in the country, before a young gentleman, a Roman Catholic, of a good family, and con&s;ider|able e&s;tate, then on a vi&s;it to a Baronet in our neighbourhood, thought proper to pay his ad|dre&s;&s;es to me, which I politely but peremptorily declined. Not di&s;couraged, however, by this, he preferred his &s;uit to my father, and brought him over to his cau&s;e.</Q> <Q>Eliza,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>one day to me, whil&s;t at breakfa&s;t, heaven has
<PB N="72" REF="69">thought proper to deprive me of your mother, and, according to the cour&s;e of nature, it cannot be long before I follow her. I have no attachment to this world but you, and could I &s;ee you re|&s;pectably and happily &s;ettled, I &s;hould not care how &s;oon I left it. The gentleman you have &s;een, is a young man of good family, and of con&s;iderable land|ed property; he is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed by all who know him, and an alliance with him would give me great plea&s;ure. He has made me very honourable pro|po&s;als of marriage for you, and I think you cannot do better than receive him. With re&s;pect to &s;ettlements he has offered a <HI>carte
<PB N="73" REF="70">blanche,</HI> and you may make what terms you think proper.</Q></P>
<Q><P>I TOLD him, that not only duty, but gratitude would lead me to pay every proper attention to his recommendation, parti|cularly in a ca&s;e where I was convinced he &s;tudied only my happine&s;s; that under this idea, I flattered my&s;elf he would leave me mi&s;tre&s;s of my own actions, e&s;pecially in a matter that &s;o nearly concerned me; that &s;orry as I was, not to acquie&s;ce with him, I mu&s;t take the liberty of putting a negative upon the pro|po&s;al; for that I had been &s;o &s;ickened of matrimony upon a former occa&s;ion, that I mu&s;t be altered in my nature before I
<PB N="74" REF="71">could li&s;ten to a &s;econd propo&s;al; that I was very well contented with my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and wi&s;hed for no change, and that if it plea&s;ed Providence to remove him from me, I tru&s;ted I &s;hould have &s;ufficient to &s;upport me to the utmo&s;t of my ambition.</P>
<P>IT would be idle to recount to you, the long debate that was held between us upon this &s;ub|ject. On his part, it was carried on with warmth, but I was re|&s;olved to keep my engagement with you, conceiving that &s;ome accident had prevented my hear|ing from you; for the letters, you &s;ay you wrote, never reached me, owing probably to our removal from London. When my father
<PB N="75" REF="72">found me determined not to li&s;t|en to this propo&s;al, he became exa&s;perated, and deprived me of almo&s;t every indulgence. In &s;hort, not to tire you out with accounts, that would be irk&s;ome to you to hear, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to me to tell; he in&s;i&s;ted on it, that I &s;hould not live with him, but retire to a convent and take the veil; for he would &s;ooner &s;ee me in my coffin, than that I &s;hould do any thing to di&s;grace his fami|ly. No intreaties, no prayers of mine could turn him from his purpo&s;e; my life was grown a burthen to me; I de&s;paired of hearing any more from you, and, of cour&s;e, &s;ubmitted to his di&s;|po&s;al of me; and I believe, as aver&s;e as I found my&s;elf to a &s;e|que&s;tered
<PB N="76" REF="73">life, had chance not thrown you in my way, I &s;hould have been prevailed on, by the ladies in the hou&s;e where I was; and, at the end of my novice&s;hip, have taken the veil.</P></Q>
<P>I HAD now been three months a|broad, and as the matter had blown over, for which I left England, and the mini&s;try was changed, I con|ceived there could be no danger in returning, and accordingly quitted St. Omer's, and &s;et off for London.</P>
<P>WHEN we reached London, till we could get a lodging, we put up at one of tho&s;e taverns called hotels, where, under a fal&s;e idea of furni&s;h|ing better accommodations than is to be met with at inns, they con|trive
<PB N="77" REF="74">to pick the pockets of their gue&s;ts. My plan of operations was to return to the profe&s;&s;ion of an au|thor, which I conceived, not only to be the mo&s;t lucrative I could pur&s;ue, but the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, tru&s;ting to Providence for future expectancies; but &s;eeing in one of the new&s;papers an adverti&s;e|ment that &s;truck me, from a man who adverti&s;ed places under government to be di&s;po&s;ed of; with the earlie&s;t intelligence of vacancies in all departments; and being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little money, I was willing fir&s;t to try what I could do here; I accordingly wait|ed on Provider the place-monger, (for that was the adverti&s;er's name) and the following was, as near as I

<P>IN &s;hort, from this man's account, not finding I could &s;uit my&s;elf with|out a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, more than I had to &s;pare, I gave up the idea, and determined to employ my&s;elf in the literary way. Accord|ingly I took a genteel fir&s;t floor in a private &s;treet, for which I was to
<PB N="89" REF="86">pay one guinea and a half a week and re&s;umed my own name, Ed|ward Wilbraham. I gave my hand a &s;econd time in marriage to my dear Eliza, according to the ceremonies of the Engli&s;h church; and when we were &s;ettled in our lodging, my next &s;tep was to &s;eek out for employ. My idea was to get into the pay of &s;ome opulent book&s;eller. I applied to the man who printed the <HI>Flogger</HI> for me, made him my friend, and found him of u&s;e to me. He recommended me, to a patriot book&s;eller, as a man who&s;e talents were adapted to any thing in the &s;cribbling line, and as one (which weighs mo&s;t with the trade) who would write a great deal for a little money. To this man I was introduced, and he a&s;ked me if I was
<PB N="90" REF="87">a good hand at a &s;peech. I told him I was no orator, at lea&s;t I had never tried my abilities that way. <Q>I don't want you,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>to bellow forth your&s;elf; but can you pen a good bellowing &s;peech for another? My friend tells me,</Q> continued he, <Q>you are a pretty good politician, and as a variety of ignorant and illiterate people now creep into parliament, (&s;ome to &s;helter them&s;elves from a jail, others hoping to get &s;ome|thing by mouthing at and baiting the mini&s;ter) the&s;e per&s;ons are in continual want of &s;omething to &s;ay, and I am daily applied to to get &s;peeches penned for them. If you are clever at this, I can employ you the whole &s;e&s;&s;ions: you have nothing to do, but to
<PB N="91" REF="88">collect the &s;ubjects from the new&s;|papers, which generally announce the bu&s;ine&s;s that is to come on, that is the order of a future day, and have the &s;peech ready for de|livery the day before.</Q> And what, Sir, is to be my pay, &s;ays I, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions? <Q>That,</Q> returns he, <Q>depends upon the length of the &s;peech, and the &s;hortne&s;s of the time in which it is to be compo&s;ed. Sometimes,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>we don't know the bu&s;i|ne&s;s twenty-four hours before|hand: in this ca&s;e it is all night work, and if cleverly done, I may give you a guinea, at other times we &s;eldom exceed half the money, and &s;ometimes a crown. But you need not fear proper encourage|ment, if you hit them off well,
<PB N="92" REF="89">and are keen at a la&s;h. Only take care to put the tittles to your <HI>i</HI>'s, and the cro&s;&s;es to your <HI>t</HI>'s, and write pretty plain, or &s;ome of my gentlemen will not be able to read them.</Q> I undertook the ta&s;k, and had &s;ufficient employ; for as I threw into my &s;peeches plenty of &s;arca&s;m, invective, and now and then a Latin quotation, inter&s;per&s;ed with an occa&s;ional enecdote, to entertain and keep the hearers from yawning, taking care always to pre&s;erve tho&s;e <HI>elegant</HI> parliamentary phra&s;es of <Q>Habits of intimacy,</Q> <Q>Ver&s;ant in order,</Q> <Q>Honourable gentle|man in my eye,</Q> and the like; and as I had a happy knack of pen|ning them in different language and &s;tile, &s;o as to adapt them to the cha|racter of the &s;peakers, there &s;eldom
<PB N="93" REF="90">pa&s;&s;ed a week during the whole &s;e&s;|&s;ions, that I did not pick up four or five guineas. For a mode&s;t man I wrote in the third per&s;on, for an egoti&s;t in the fir&s;t, and never failed to give &s;cope to the natural feelings and di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;peaker. When parliament broke up, I was employ|ed to write &s;ermons for the clergy. In this manufacture I was not paid &s;o well. Seldom could I get more than a crown for the be&s;t written di&s;cour&s;e, except it was wanted by a bi&s;hop, or it was required to be printed; in the&s;e ca&s;es, I had half a guinea. Indeed the clergy cared not how &s;hort and little decla|matory they were; for a declamatory di&s;cour&s;e requires too much exertion and trouble in the delivery.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="91">I SOON wrote my&s;elf into reputa|tion, and was applied to by a gentle|man concerned in the reviews, to take a part in one of tho&s;e periodical publications, the pay for which was two guineas per &s;heet for the quan|tity I &s;upplied. I doubted my abili|ties in this bu&s;ine&s;s, as it required a thorough knowledge of letters, to be able to criticize, with candour and preci&s;ion, the works of others. <Q>Can|dour,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>we have nothing to do with; for it has been long a cu&s;tom to admit the author of a new publication, to write his own critici&s;ms: in &s;uch ca&s;es we not only &s;ave a guinea by the quantity of matter, (for mo&s;t authors are very verbo&s;e in their own prai&s;e) but we get a guinea or two for its in&s;ertion: and as to difficulty,
<PB N="95" REF="92">there is little or none; we only expect a few cur&s;ory remarks, with here and there an entertaining extract. The pre&s;s &s;o teems with publications, that were every work &s;tudied, we &s;hould never get through them. We had a gentle|man once, who would touch us off as much poetry, mathematics, and phy&s;ic, in two hours, as would employ four compo&s;itors to &s;et up for two days, and without much knowledge in either of the &s;ub|jects; but we have lo&s;t him; he is gone to be an over&s;eer in a &s;ugar plantation in Jamaica, and we are in want of one to &s;upply his place. You may as well try your hand, and &s;ee what you can do.</Q> I &s;miled in my &s;leeve; but as I was not in a &s;itu|ation to refu&s;e an employ I thought
<PB N="96" REF="93">I could undertake, I embraced the propo&s;al, e&s;pecially as, according to the plan of my employer, it would take up but little of my time.</P>
<P>THE next day a porter came with a bundle of new books on every &s;ci|ence. I looked them over, and meeting with a political tract, a &s;ubject in which I was be&s;t read, I put together a variety of animadver|&s;ions, and &s;pun out my remarks to a con&s;iderable length, but treated the author with as much ju&s;tice and candour as I could. On my tran&s;mit|ting the manu&s;cript to the printer, he thought proper to curtail it, by putting his pen through a variety of the be&s;t arguments, which he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay were tedious and dry, but which he in reality objected to,
<PB N="97" REF="94">becau&s;e the manu&s;cript was more than he cho&s;e to pay for. This vexed me exceedingly; but as I was writing for bread, I was obliged to &s;acrifice my fame and &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the&s;e monthly critici&s;ms are in &s;uch low e&s;teem, with men of reading and good &s;en&s;e, when the printers of them will dock and mutilate a manu&s;cript as they think proper, and fill their pockets at the expence of their credit. A very ingenious performance was one day brought me, with the following laconic note, from one of the pro|prietors.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The author of the book here|with &s;ent, has been trouble&s;ome
<PB N="98" REF="95">to us; by giving him a la&s;h, you will oblige your humble &s;ervant.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>AT another time I received the following, with five octavo volumes, about &s;even in the evening.</P>
<Q>MR. Wilbraham is de&s;ired to tran&s;mit his remarks on the vo|lumes herewith &s;ent, by nine to|morrow morning, or they will be too late for publication.</Q>
<P>IN &s;hort, I found this part of my profe&s;&s;ion as barbarous and iniquitous, as my late practice of phy&s;ic; for as that was murdering of men, this was murdering of reputations; and as reputations generally outlive the pe|riod of human life, and the la&s;t &s;laugh|ter is the greate&s;t of the two, I was determined to wipe my hands of it.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="96">THERE is not a greater &s;lavery, nor a more dependent &s;ituation in the world, than to be in the pay of the book&s;ellers: they in general reward an author &s;o ill, as to keep him al|ways poor, and this poverty is their be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t encroachment: for was a good writer to publi&s;h his own works, where he gets ten pounds, he would gain a hundred. Book&s;ellers are too timid adventurers to ri&s;k much money on any one publication; and the misfortune is, a manu&s;cript never announces its &s;ucce&s;s: a book&s;eller buys as if he never &s;aw it; of cour&s;e, if a book &s;ucceeds, 'tis the book&s;el|ler, not the author, that profits by it. Were authors to be their own publi&s;hers, and to have ju&s;tice done them by all parties concerned, they would be enabled to live well: for con&s;iderable incomes have
<PB N="100" REF="97">ari&s;en from the &s;ale of &s;ome works, for the copy-right of which very &s;mall &s;ums were originally given. <HI>Burn's Ju&s;tice,</HI> a book that has brought in thou&s;ands, was originally &s;old for le&s;s than five hundred pounds, <HI>Gay's Beg|gar's Opera</HI> for thirty punds, and <HI>Mil|ton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> for fifteen pounds. And I have heard Sir J. F&mdash;ld&mdash;g &s;ay, that had his brother pre&s;erved his copies in his own hands, the fa|mily would not have been reduced to the difficulties they were. Great &s;ums of money have occa&s;ionally been given for copy-right, but his has been upon the reputaion of the au|thor; and nowith&s;tanding this, far from adequate to the intrin&s;ic value of the work. Indeed, the book&s;ellers are &s;o certain of this, that when any one of the trade fails, or retires from
<PB N="101" REF="98">bu&s;ine&s;s, and his copy-right is to be &s;old, le&s;t authors &s;hould come at the true value of &s;uch copy-right, and know what it annually brings in; though &s;uch property is &s;old by auc|tion, the &s;ale is always a private one. The book&s;ellers alone are convened, and they will &s;it a whole morning brooding over the bu&s;ine&s;s, like a number of con&s;pirators, darkly medi|tating the de&s;truction of an individual. And &s;uch is the jealou&s;y and rancour of the book&s;elling tribe, that they will depreciate a work in which the trade is not concerned, and merely on that account. <Q>How does &s;uch a book &s;ell?</Q> &s;ays a cu&s;tomer, <Q>can you &s;hew me one?</Q> <Q>Oh, not at all,</Q> replies the book&s;eller: <Q>I never keep any: I don't know that I have been a&s;ked for more
<PB N="102" REF="99">than one &s;ince it has been out.</Q> And you are &s;ure to find it ill &s;poken of in the <HI>reviews.</HI> That this will be the fate of mine I have not a doubt, e&s;pecially after what I have &s;aid, and having &s;ent this hi&s;tory into the world, under the patronage of the Literary Society.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an a&s;&s;ociation of literary men, who print and publi&s;h &s;uch new and original works of authors, at their own ri&s;k and ex|pence, as &s;hall be &s;ubmitted to their peru&s;al, and they &s;hall think worth printing; give the author all profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ame, and leave him in full and free po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his copy-right; an in&s;titution truly patriotic and prai&s;e-worthy, and de&s;erving of the highe&s;t encouragement; as it mu&s;t prove very benefi|cial to the intere&s;t of a u&s;eful &s;et of men, and tend to the promotion of literature. See a fuller account of this plan at the end of this volume.</NOTE> But let him, or
<PB N="103" REF="100">any other book&s;eller with whom he is connected, be concerned in the copy, and he will put it into the hands of every one, with <Q>Have you &s;een this, Sir? It is a book in great e&s;timation, and &s;ells ra|pidly.</Q> Then again, by way of deception, though they print but five hundred copies, the title-page &s;hall be altered five times in &s;uch an edition, the &s;econd hundred having the words <HI>&s;econd edition</HI> in the title, of the third hundred the <HI>third edi|tion,</HI> and &s;o on: &s;o that the third edition of a book &s;hall be adverti&s;ed and &s;elling, before a &s;ufficient number are &s;old to pay even paper or print.

<PB N="104" REF="101">to bring my bantlings into the world, they were not &s;trangled in the birth. Indeed they have been obliged to live by their own little merit, a prohibition being laid by the proprietors of the reviews, on tho&s;e who write for them, not to &s;ay a &s;ingle word in the favour of any thing they know to be mine, but to handle it as &s;everely as they can. I have this &s;atisfaction, however, to think, that whatever little reputa|tion I may have acquired, they can|not dimini&s;h it: or even, if they could, they cannot hinder me from being ea&s;y under their attacks.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XXI.</HEAD>
<P>I WENT on &s;ucce&s;sfully as an author, and found that the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, under the circum&s;tances I have mentioned, enabled me to live, and cut a much better figure than I expected; but had I been poor, I &s;hould not have repined, the pover|ty of a man of letters being a proof only, that he never pro&s;titut|ed either his per&s;on or his pen. I fell into the hands of a very re&s;pect|able book&s;eller, a man who had
<PB N="106" REF="103">pride and &s;pirit above the re&s;t of the trade, and who &s;corned to be guilty of a mean or narrow action. This man did ju&s;tice to every work I put into his hands, &s;ettled his ac|count very regularly, and paid his ballances punctually. I did &s;o well that I took a hou&s;e before I had been twelve months married, and appeared in a &s;tile that would not have di&s;graced any of my father's family. My Eliza ble&s;&s;ed me with a &s;on, and we were as happy as matrimony, reciprocal affection, and good circum&s;tances could render us. We made &s;everal applications to Mr. Wildman, who was &s;o exa&s;perat|ed at the conduct of his daughter, that he would attend to none of them, and I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding again&s;t him in law,
<PB N="107" REF="104">to recover the three hundred a year that became the property of my wife on the death of her mother. Many terms elap&s;ed before I could bring the matter to a final hearing. I at fir&s;t fell into the hands of one of tho&s;e attornies who know how to handle a client to the be&s;t advan|tage. Notwith&s;tanding all my cau|tion, I was not aware of the injury they could do me; I little expect|ed, they ever carried matters to &s;uch lengths, as to take money of the oppo&s;ite party, and betray their employers; but I now found my|&s;elf mi&s;taken, for I di&s;covered when the cau&s;e was at i&s;&s;ue, that my at|torney had given notice of trial, that he had been bought over on the other &s;ide, and had omitted to attend: the con&s;equence was a non|&s;uit
<PB N="108" REF="105">and I was &s;erved with an exe|cution for a <HI>non pros;</HI> that is, for not pro&s;ecuting the matter to a hearing. Attornies are liable to be &s;truck off the roll for this conduct, and I was very well di&s;po&s;ed to make an example of mine; but, a friend di&s;&s;uaded me from it with the following argument: <Q>If you move the Court of King's Bench again&s;t him, it mu&s;t be on <HI>affi|davit,</HI> and I &s;hould not wonder if &s;uch a ra&s;cal was to &s;uborn witne&s;&s;es to prove you perjured, and &s;et you in the pillory.</Q> Mo&s;t attornies will delay a &s;uit, in order to put a few term and other fees into their pockets; and, when the &s;olicitor has done, the bar|ri&s;ter takes it up. In this cau&s;e of mine as the lawyers found that money was
<PB N="109" REF="106">not wanting on either &s;ide, they took care to make the mo&s;t of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Many frivolous pretences are often urged to delay the hear|ing; but I could never &s;uppo&s;e, that when the cau&s;e is once called on, that any mea&s;ures are pur&s;ued to put off the trial: but I was now convinced to the contrary, for, as I have ob&s;erved, when the attornies have done, the coun&s;el begin; they will move under various pretexts to defer its coming on from day to day, purpo&s;ely that the barri&s;ters retained may have fre&s;h retaining fees; for every adjournment of a cau&s;e puts fre&s;h &s;ums into the pockets of the pleaders; and this cu&s;tom meets with too much coun|tenance from above, &s;o that when the witne&s;&s;es are all ready and every
<PB N="110" REF="107">thing prepared, the hearing &s;hall be unexpectedly adjourned. Such is the glorious uncertainty of the law!&mdash;<HI>Why are the lawyers always dre&s;&s;ed in black?</HI> &s;ays a countryman. <HI>Out of re&s;pect to their clients, who&s;e heirs they are.</HI> However, my next at|torney was exceedingly indu&s;trious, and to do him ju&s;tice, &s;o ready to &s;erve my cau&s;e, that he once a&s;ked me at parting, who was to find the witne&s;&s;es, he or I?&mdash;A decree was at la&s;t obtained in my favour, and I was put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>WE were now as happy as hearts could wi&s;h, and being at the re|ceipt of about eight hundred pounds a year, we envied not others as many thou&s;ands. But, in the career
<PB N="111" REF="108">of all this felicity, an accident hap|pened that for a while bla&s;ted the whole. My poor Eliza, coming home one evening from the opera, caught cold: the con&s;equence was a putrid fever, that, in &s;pite of every medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, took her off in the every bloom of her youth; and it is but ju&s;tice to her memory, that I &s;hould &s;ay, &s;he died as &s;he lived, the pride of innocence and of virtue. Her la&s;t words to me were, <Q>My dear Edward, after con&s;ign|ing to you the care of my in|fant boy, I have but one reque&s;t to make. Imprudent as my father may think I have acted, I pre&s;ume, he will feel my lo&s;s. Unkindly as he may have acted by <HI>me,</HI> he is <HI>&s;till</HI> my <HI>father,</HI> and, for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, let no unguard|ed
<PB N="112" REF="109">action of <HI>your's</HI> add to his di&s;tre&s;s.</Q> A few months after|wards, the &s;mall pox bereaved me of my &s;on; and this &s;econd &s;troke of affliction, following quick upon the heels of the fir&s;t, quite unmanned me; it was a con&s;iderable time be|fore I recovered my former &s;pirits, I thought of nothing, <Q>but going down into the grave, mourning;</Q> but Providence has &s;o wi&s;ely tem|pered our frames, that the impre&s;|&s;ion, which the <HI>deepe&s;t</HI> calamity leaves upon the mind, <HI>will,</HI> wear away like other &s;ublunary things. My Eliza had been the boa&s;t of my life and the admiration of all her acquaintance, and I mourned for her, not as the generality of the world mourns, but truly and &s;incerely. Mourning for the dead
<PB N="113" REF="110">is now become a farce, and there is no appearance of &s;orrow in the &s;urviving relations, but in the coat they wear. Many an heir has put on his weepers with as much glee, as a birth-day embroidery; and many a widow takes more pride in her weeds, than in her bridal cloaths. On the death of a nobleman whom I knew, his lady, from an opinion that the melancholy event would affect her &s;on, even more than it had her&s;elf, (he having been bred up under the &s;ame roof, and expe|rienced from his father the height of parental fondne&s;s) prevailed up|on a friend, a man of addre&s;s, to wait on him and break it to him, in the tendere&s;t manner he could. This gentleman having taken &s;ome pains to open the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o as to arm
<PB N="114" REF="111">him for the doleful news, conclud|ed with ob&s;erving, that as it was ab|&s;urd to conceal the truth from him, &s;ince his good &s;en&s;e would reconcile him to the event; he mu&s;t tell him, that his father had paid the debt of nature and was dead. The young man, at the &s;ound of the la&s;t word, &s;tarted back and &s;tared him in the face; then repeating the world <HI>dead</HI> emphatically; he pau&s;ed&mdash;and whil&s;t his friend was in pain, con|ceiving he had told his &s;tory too abruptly, the young man put him at his ea&s;e, and, with a to&s;s of the chin, made up his own mind upon the occa&s;ion, with the follow|ing declaration.&mdash;<Q>I'll have a <HI>black</HI> chariot:&mdash;my greys will look <HI>&s;weetly</HI> in it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="112">As a literary man, I was invit|ed to the hou&s;es of many very re|&s;pectable per&s;onages; but, proud as I might be of the honour, I met with little there but mortifica|tion. I was placed at the lower end of the table; helped to an ordinary part; not attended to, per|haps, when I &s;poke; reque&s;ted oc|ca&s;ionally to ri&s;e and ring the bell; not &s;uffered to cut in at the whi&s;t table, and &s;uch other &s;lights. As I con&s;idered my&s;elf, if not of equal rank in life with the re&s;t of the company, yet, as having more knowledge, and more abilities, and of cour&s;e equally entitled to re&s;pect, I mu&s;t own it hurt me; but why, if I di&s;liked it, did I go into the way of it? Becau&s;e, I thought to benefit by their acquaintance. In|deed,
<PB N="116" REF="113">I frequently reconciled this behaviour to me, by &s;aying to my|&s;elf, the&s;e men do not in reality de&s;pi&s;e <HI>me.</HI> It is my <HI>fortune</HI> they contemn; and they are not &s;o much in the wrong, for it is certainly a &s;mall one.&mdash;I determined, therefore, to put up with the indignity, but made u&s;e of them in my turn. I never refu&s;ed any thing they were di&s;po&s;ed to pre&s;ent me, and took every advantage their &s;ituation threw in my way.</P>
<P>I THINK, for the honour of our nobility, it &s;hould be known, that whil&s;t one is engaged at a cricket-match, &s;acrificing the welfare of the &s;tate to the bat and the wick|et, another &s;hall be boxing with po&s;t-boys and po&s;tillions, and ano|ther running a race with a chim|ney-&s;weeper
<PB N="117" REF="114">up a chimney, the devil within, the peer without; but, he who ran within, beat the other hollow; for he was hooping <HI>&s;weep</HI> at the top, before his lord|&s;hip was half way up. They talk of the dignity of the peerage; time was when an Engli&s;h Baron was the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character in the world; but the dignity of the modern peerage con&s;i&s;ts in being a di&s;grace to manhood.</P>
<P>I WAS one day a&s;ked to dine with the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in admini&s;tration. He was a per&s;on whom I knew only by character; but that character did him honour, and made me an|xious to be known to him. He was a nobleman, who, though con|&s;cious of his own dignity and care|ful
<PB N="118" REF="115">never to commit him&s;elf, put every one at their ea&s;e about him and never attempted to rai&s;e his own con&s;equence, by le&s;&s;ening that of another: he never &s;et his chap|lain at a &s;ide table, or trod upon his toes to &s;ilence him in a con|ver&s;ation; nor ever a&s;ked a depen|dant to ri&s;e from dinner to ring the bell, or let in his dog; but, as his &s;ituation in life required him occa|&s;ionally to mix with men of inferior rank, he was indu&s;triou&s;ly atten|tive to &s;uch men, le&s;t they might fell them&s;elves wounded, at any &s;eeming neglect.&mdash;It is wonderful to reflect on the ignorance of tho&s;e brought up in high life! To know a great deal of the world, is a phra&s;e they affect, whereas to real worldly knowledge they are utter
<PB N="119" REF="116">&s;trangers. The mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible among them are ignorant of every thing beyond their line of life, and they owe their ignorance to their pride. Were they open to information, they have frequent opportunities of being very well informed. If there be any thing to be envied in rank, it is, that their &s;ituation enables them to have men of learning and knowledge frequently at their tables, but, when they are &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, from a mi&s;taken notion of elevation, they &s;hut their eyes and ears to that inform|ation they might otherwi&s;e acquire.</P>
<P>THE Marquis coveted my acquaint|ance, I believe, from an opinion, that I might be u&s;eful to him with my pen. As &s;oon as decency per|mitted me to go abroad, I waited on him, and when my name was
<PB N="120" REF="117">announced, he very politely met me at the foot of his &s;tairs; told me how greatly flattered he was with my vi&s;it; the principal object of which was to reque&s;t my opi|nion of a paper he delivered to me &s;ealed up, and which he begged me to put in my pocket till my return home, as he had &s;ome com|pany above to whom he meant to introduce me. The&s;e were &s;everal gentlemen of his acquaintance, whom he al&s;o invited to dinner. Among them, to my &s;urpri&s;e and mortification, was Lord B. the per|&s;on from who&s;e hands I had e&s;cap|ed, when I left Mr. Wildman's. His father was dead, and he was now the Earl of S. I pre&s;ently knew him, but he remembered nothing of me: nor, having changed my
<PB N="121" REF="118">name, did any circum&s;tance lead to a di&s;covery. But, as fate would have it, during the afternoon, in the hour of hilarity, talking of their amours; the Marquis of G. rallying Lord S. ob&s;erved in good nature, that he had little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of predilections, for to him they had nearly been attended with bad con|&s;equences. <Q>Was that fellow,</Q> &s;ays the Marquis, <Q>whom you way|laid in Berkley-Square, never heard of afterwards?</Q> <Q>No,</Q> replied his lord&s;hip, &s;miling, <Q>the ra&s;cal, I dare &s;ay, has been hang|ed at &s;ome country a&s;&s;izes long before this. How the devil &s;o fine a girl as Mi&s;s Wildman could countenance the advances of &s;o low and ignorant a &s;coundrel, to me is a&s;toni&s;hing.</Q>
<PB N="122" REF="119">I ob&s;erved, that the ladies in ge|neral, being made of finer materi|als than our &s;ex, were ble&s;&s;ed with a peculiar di&s;cernment, and could di&s;cover beauties and perfect|ions in man, much readier than we could; at lea&s;t, we mu&s;t leave them at liberty to know what they them&s;elves be&s;t like. <Q>Yes, Sir,</Q> returns Lord S. <Q>but, this fel|low was a &s;ervant of her father's, and one of the mo&s;t low-bred &s;coundrels in the world.&mdash;You are unacquinted with the &s;tory, Sir, and therefore cannot decide upon the merits of it.</Q> I told his lord&s;hip, that the affair was a very public one and within my recollection; that I knew &s;ome of the parties, and that he was more indebted to that low bred fellow's
<PB N="123" REF="120">forgivene&s;s, for his impunity, than to any ju&s;tification of the &s;teps he took. <Q>You &s;eem to take this bu&s;ine&s;s up, Sir,</Q> replies Lord S. warmly, <Q>in a very ungentle|man-like manner, and very un|becoming the &s;ituation in which you were introduced here.</Q> The Marquis would have interfered, but I reque&s;ted to be heard upon the occa&s;ion. <Q>I am not in&s;en&s;i|ble,</Q> &s;ays I, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Lord S. <Q>of the honour Lord G. has done me, by inviting me to his hou&s;e, and I beg his lord|&s;hip's pardon, for any thing that may have e&s;caped me to trouble the harmony of the afternoon; but, I flatter my&s;elf, he would not wi&s;h to con&s;ider me in a &s;ituation below that of a gentle|man,
<PB N="124" REF="121">and as a proper acquaint|ance for him&s;elf. I cannot boa&s;t of titulary honours; but, in point of family, education, and abilities, I am &s;econd but to few. All gentlemen are upon an e|quality; &s;o far, my lord, I am your equal, and will &s;ubmit to no indignity.</Q> At this, he ro&s;e and walked about the room in heat, muttering the words, <Q>fellow&mdash;im|pertinence, impudence.</Q>&mdash;One of the company reque&s;ted me, apart, to retire a few minutes, till Lord S's heat had &s;ub&s;ided. This I totally objected to, declaring, <Q>I had more rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed than his lord&s;hip; that if he knew me, I was per&s;uaded he would not dare to look in my face; that I was the very man, that his
<PB N="125" REF="122">unguarded tongue had traduced; that I gloried in being that very <HI>ra&s;cal</HI> and <HI>&s;coundrel</HI> his lord&s;hip had thought proper to calumni|ate; that I was nearly allied to the Wilbrahams of Notting|ham&s;hire; that I was in the en|tail of that e&s;tate; that I had married Mi&s;s Wildman, though Providence has been plea&s;ed &s;ince to take her from me; and that at the pre&s;ent moment, I enjoyed part of the family e&s;tate: in a word, that though fate once had frowned on me and I had worn a livery, I was born and bred a gentleman, and was as indepen|dent as any man living; that the language his lord&s;hip held out to me, was &s;uch as could not be put up with, and that he would
<PB N="126" REF="123">find I &s;hould re&s;ent it warmly.</Q> Thunder&s;truck at this account, the company knew not how to act; but, I &s;oon left them to them&s;elves, for, approaching the Marquis of G. I told him how unhappy the event of that day had made me, not on my <HI>own</HI> account, but <HI>his,</HI> having been the unwilling cau&s;e of troub|ling the quiet of his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e: that for the pre&s;ent I would take my leave; thanked him for the good opinion he had been plea&s;ed to en|tertain of me, and tru&s;ted my con|duct in life was, and would be &s;uch, as to leave him no room to af|ter it.</P>
<P>ON my return home, I broke open the cover, that contained the paper his lord&s;hip had given me,
<PB N="127" REF="124">and found it to be a grant from the crown, of a pen&s;ion of three hun|dred pounds a year, with a warrant to receive a quarter's pay in advance.</P>
<P>THE next morning, I called upon a particular friend of mine, with whom I had lately made an ac|quaintance, told him the event of ye&s;terday, and how determined I was to puni&s;h Lord S. for the in|&s;ult offered, not &s;o much to my&s;elf, for <HI>that,</HI> as he did not know me, I could overlook, nor through re|venge at the mode he took to get rid of his hated rival, for as &s;uch he under&s;tood me; but for the in|dignity, treachery and violence he had offered to my late wife, when Mi&s;s Wildman, and who&s;e memory I revered beyond every thing. I
<PB N="128" REF="125">importuned this friend to wait on Lord S. from me, and to reque&s;t he would meet me the next morning at &s;ix, at the ring in Hyde Park, in order to give me that &s;atisfaction the injuries he had done me, enti|tled me to a&s;k.</P>
<P>MY friend &s;aw him, and his lord|&s;hip's an&s;wer was, he mu&s;t fir&s;t know me to be a gentleman, before he &s;hould attend to any call of mine upon &s;uch a &s;ubject. I &s;ent him word, that he need only advi&s;e with the Marquis of G. upon the occa|&s;ion, and I would abide by his de|termination. The re&s;ult of which was, on my friend's &s;eeing him a|gain, that he would certainly meet me at the time and place appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="126">I ADJUSTED very thing I thought nece&s;&s;ary to arrange, and was with my friend upon the ground, half an hour before the time. Lord S. kept his appointment punctually, and &s;oon after me appeared with <HI>his</HI> friend; the etiquette on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions being &s;ettled, we di&s;charged a brace of pi&s;tols at each other, but without effect. Our friends then interfered, and would have had the matter terminate; but as I did not come there to make a parade of any boa&s;ted heroi&s;m, but to bring my enemy to a &s;en&s;e of the injury he had done Mi&s;s Wildman, I in&s;i&s;ted upon his drawing his &s;word; which was immediately complied with, and he attacked me with all the fury of revenge; but I being &s;omething cooler, and ma&s;ter of the weapon,
<PB N="130" REF="127">parried his thru&s;ts with temper; after a few pa&s;&s;es, wounded him in the &s;word arm, and, as I had done on a former occa&s;ion, di&s;armed him. Finding him&s;elf thus in my power, he acknowledged his error, apolo|gized for his warmth at the Mar|quis of G.'s, and &s;aid, had he known &s;o much of me then, as he did now, he &s;hould not have acted as he had; that his temper frequently betray|ed him into &s;teps, he afterwards repented of, and this was one of them; that fortune had now thrown him into my hands, and he was at my mercy, and if nothing but his life could atone for his ra&s;hne&s;s, I might take it. My lord, replied I, I mu&s;t again repeat, that I came not here with any blood-thir&s;ty view; it is not your <HI>life</HI> I &s;eek; had
<PB N="131" REF="128">I been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, I could have taken it at &s;everal moments within the&s;e ten minutes pa&s;t. I aim only to redre&s;s the wrong done to the memory of an injured lady, one whom your ungovernable phrenzy would have &s;acrificed to a lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion; but as &s;he had a &s;oul above revenge, I undertaken to give you back your forfeited life, a life you now owe to the love I bore that be&s;t of women. He acknowledged the force of all I &s;aid, and I believe we parted in better temper with each other, than when we met.</P>
<P>NOTHING can &s;hew a greater want of &s;en&s;e; nothing betrays a man into more embarra&s;&s;ments, than being to free of &s;peech in public company. We know not whom we
<PB N="132" REF="129">talk before, nor how far the per&s;ons we &s;peak to, are intere&s;ted in what we &s;ay. An unguarded tongue has frequently co&s;t me an unhappy hour; it had nearly co&s;t Lord S. his life.</P>
<P>THOUGH I was hurried by the re&s;pect I bore the memory of my Eliza into this act, and it ended without any fatal con&s;equences, I cannot but condemn the too general practice of duelling upon the &s;light|e&s;t occa&s;ions. There is &s;uch an in|con&s;i&s;tent etiquette in the&s;e affairs of honour, that nothing but the ab&s;urde&s;t cu&s;tom can ju&s;tify. A man will, by his conduct and de|clarations, pride him&s;elf in being a ra&s;cal, and if any one &s;hould pre|&s;ume to &s;ub&s;cribe to the character
<PB N="133" REF="130">he is plea&s;ed to give him&s;elf, he calls him out, determining, as <HI>his mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,</HI> to cut this man's throat as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. And though &s;uch per&s;ons meet the great|e&s;t enemies, and endeavour to rob each other of life, a few minutes &s;hall make them the be&s;t friends in the world. If there be any argument in its favour, it is that of keeping gentlemen within the bounds of civility to each other; but when we con&s;ider how far it is often &s;trained, it is to be lamented, that &s;ome powerful means are not taken to aboli&s;h it. The gentlemen of Ireland are very capricious in this re&s;pect; I admire their feelings, but I condemn their ra&s;hne&s;s. The fol|lowing &s;tory will explain my ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="131">A YOUNG gentleman of my ac|quaintance, heir to an e&s;tate in Ire|land, found it nece&s;&s;ary to go over to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but, &s;et|ting, perhaps, a greater value upon his life than it de&s;erved, and know|ing the ha&s;ty temper of the Iri&s;h, and his own feelings as a man, he dreaded the thoughts of venturing into a country, where he conceived it almo&s;t next to an impo&s;&s;ibility of coming away again in a whole &s;kin, till the following thought reconciled it to him. He re&s;olved, during the whole time he was a|broad, never to go into the com|pany of any one who wore a &s;word. He was there upwards of &s;ix weeks, had engaged for his pa&s;&s;age on his return home, and was ble&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf the day before he was to &s;ail, on
<PB N="135" REF="132">his prudence and di&s;cretion; but to leave Ireland, and &s;ee nothing of the world there, would be ridicu|lous. Now, his notions of the world were, to &s;pend a few hours at a bagnio; he determined, there|fore, to pa&s;s his la&s;t evening in one of tho&s;e hou&s;es, where he met with a couple of ladies, the only two in the hou&s;e, whom he propo&s;ed to entertain with a &s;upper. Whil&s;t this was preparing, the waiter en|tered with <Q>there is a gentleman in the hou&s;e, Sir, who&s;e name is Patrick Shilalah; he &s;ends his compliments to your honour, and begs you'll permit him to be of your party.</Q> At this me&s;&s;age, my friend's prudence took the alarm, and he returned the following, <Q>make my compliments to the
<PB N="136" REF="133">gentleman, and tell him, as I have not the honour to be known to him, and as my &s;tay here will be very &s;hort, I hope he will ex|cu&s;e me.</Q> The waiter &s;oon re|turned, with Mr. Patrick Shilalah's compliments, and <Q>if you won't admit of his company, he begs he may have one of the ladies.</Q> <Q>Do, my dear Jenny,</Q> &s;ays my friend to one of the girls, <Q>do&mdash; pray&mdash;go to the gentleman.</Q> She accordingly went, but the waiter was again di&s;patched, with <Q>the gentleman's compliments, and begs the other lady, for he did not like the one he had.</Q> Vex|ed and di&s;appointed, and not think|ing either of the girls worth fight|ing for, he prevailed on the other to go al&s;o, and in the height of this
<PB N="137" REF="134">mortification called for the &s;upper, when the waiter told him, <Q>it was carried in to Mr. Patrick Shila|lah and the ladies.</Q> Irritated beyond mea&s;ure at this treatment, he at fir&s;t meditated revenge; but on cooler con&s;ideration, as he was not known, was going for England in the morning, and &s;hould proba|bly never be in Ireland again, he deemed it be&s;t to pocket the affront, and make the be&s;t of his way home to his lodgings; where he had &s;carcely got into bed, but a loud knock was heard at the door, and &s;oon after, his &s;ervant came into his room with, <Q>there is a gentleman below, Sir, who calls him&s;elf Patrick Shilalah, and &s;ays, that being con&s;cious he has not treat|ed you as he &s;hould have done, is
<PB N="138" REF="135">come to offer you gentleman's &s;atisfactions.</Q> <Q>Good God! Thomas,</Q> replied my friend, <Q>make my compliments to the gentleman, tell him, I am in bed or I would wait on him, and that I am not the lea&s;t offended with any part of his conduct, being rather happy it was in my power to contribute to his amu&s;ements.</Q> This &s;ent Mr. Patrick Shilalah off, and my friend, unwilling to tru&s;t him&s;elf an hour longer on Iri&s;h ground, ha&s;ted on board the packet, and waited there till it &s;ailed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now in &s;ome repute as an author, I had a vi&s;it from the clergyman whom I have &s;poken of before in the Sixth Chapter, as a <HI>Nealogi&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;peaker of new words.</NOTE> He introduced him&s;elf to me, by &s;aying, that he &s;hould have thought him&s;elf unpardonable, had he omitted to <HI>&s;alutate</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pay his re&s;pects to.</NOTE> a gentleman to whom <HI>erudites</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Men of erudition.</NOTE> were &s;o much in|debted.
<PB N="140" REF="137">He appeared to me to be an <HI>outr&eacute;e</HI> character, and as &s;uch I che|ri&s;hed his acquaintance. He ob&s;erved to me, that the <HI>literati</HI> were obliged to him for a variety of new-coined words, which he intended to pre&s;ent to the proprietors of dictionaries, and in this, he flattered him&s;elf, he &s;hould be of more real &s;ervice to the age, than all the lexicographers and writers who had gone before him; that circumlocution was not only expen&s;ive to the breath, but tire&s;ome to the ear; that the beauty of diction con&s;i&s;ted in its being full and nervous, and that the &s;horter a &s;entence, the more perfect it was, and the le&s;s at|tention it required; that pleona&s;m might be a figure in rhetoric, but it was the rhetoric of former ages, when a man was e&s;teemed for his
<PB N="141" REF="138"><HI>&s;uper abundity</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supera bundance.</NOTE> of words; <Q>but now,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>the le&s;s a man &s;ays, the more he is &s;uppo&s;ed to think; and a <HI>cogitator</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A thinking man.</NOTE> is always con&s;idered as an <HI>intelligent.</HI></Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A man of under&s;tanding.</NOTE> This was all &s;aid with that volubility of tongue, and rapidity of utterance, as &s;carce to admit of his taking breath, much le&s;s of leaving me an opportunity to reply. He next pro|ceeded to tell me, that he had an uni|ver&s;al acquaintance in the literary world; that he corre&s;ponded with every author of reputation, both abroad and at home, and had the fir&s;t intelligence and copy of every publi|cation, either printed, or de&s;igned for the pre&s;s. He told me he was
<PB N="142" REF="139">going to pay a vi&s;it to his friend Dr. Pompo&s;o, a very extraordinary cha|racter, but a great <HI>erudite,</HI> and a&s;ked me to accompany him. Wi&s;hing to be acquainted with men of learning, I accepted his invitation, and chear|fully went with him.</P>
<P>As we were walking to this man's hou&s;e, he informed me that Dr. Pompo&s;o was a warm friend to wri|ters of this country, but would not admit that real learning had ever ex|tended beyond it. <Q>Nay,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>his predilection for England &s;o <HI>abducts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carries him &s;o far.</NOTE> him, that he avers they are all blockheads on the other &s;ide the Tweed.</Q> He told me, that when Abernethy fir&s;t publi&s;hed tho&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="140">&s;ermons which were not known to be his, by any <HI>upography</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Name &s;ub&s;cribed.</NOTE> in the title page, ("except by me," &s;ays he, with a kind of triumphant nod, "and I was &s;ilent,") they fell in Pompo&s;o's way. Enraptured with the arguments, and ravi&s;hed with the diction, he carried a volume always in his pocket, and introduced it every where as the &s;tandard of correct lan|guage. But unfortunately the &s;econd edition appeared with the author's name affixed. The volume was no longer <HI>circumge&s;ted</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Carried about him.</NOTE>; he forgot, or wi&s;hed to forget, both the &s;ermons and their author. It happened, how|ever, one day, that one of his <HI>nece&s;&s;arii,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intimate friends.</NOTE> who &s;poke always from
<PB N="144" REF="141">Pompo&s;o's mouth, had been <HI>depredi|cating</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crying up.</NOTE> in company Abernethy's language, and reque&s;ted from the Doctor a &s;ight of the volume, to ve|rify his a&s;&s;ertions. He replied that he had never &s;een Abernethy's &s;er|mons. <Q>What!</Q> retorts his friend, <Q>not that Abernethy who&s;e lan|guage you extol as a model of per|fection? </Q> <Q>Perfection!</Q> returns he angrily; <Q>I never knew a <HI>Scotchman</HI> yet, that could write a line of grammar.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN we reached Pompo&s;o's hou&s;e, I was introduced to him as one of the literati, whom he mu&s;t <HI>&s;uperbiate,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Be proud.</NOTE> to receive. He never moved from his chair, but (which
<PB N="145" REF="142">was in him a great mark of conde&s;cen|&s;ion) di&s;ired me to be &s;eated. He had &s;everal per&s;ons with him, who &s;eem|ed to have been writing, for each had a pocket book and pencil in his hand. Pompo&s;o was very near &s;ighted, and being bent with age, his head hung down &s;o much, that his chin re&s;ted upon his bo&s;om; of cour&s;e he could &s;ee nothing right before him. This happened to be his levee day, and is apartment was crowded. On our being &s;eated among the re&s;t, he grumbled forth <Q>that the <HI>literati</HI> of the pre&s;ent times were but few; that the aera of learning had long gone by, and that latter pretenders to it, were but quacks in the republic of letters; that literature had been poi&s;oned by the modern di&s;pen&s;ers of words; and that without &s;peedy correction and
<PB N="146" REF="143">illumination in &s;cience, we &s;hould fall back into the barbari&s;ms of the darker ages.</Q> Scarce did he utter a word, but every one in the room, except our&s;elves, had his pencil to his paper, and was copying from his mouth, as if he had been an oracle. The per&s;ons pre&s;ent, I found, were a parcel of &s;cribblers, who, by adu|lation and prai&s;e, were admitted to vi&s;it him, and who, by &s;tarting dif|ferent topics, generally brought away with them a much greater &s;tore of ideas than they carried there. It was a &s;cene that entertained me for the moment, but which I never cared to renew.</P>
<P>ON my ob&s;erving to my new ac|quaintance, that, though education generally poli&s;hed the manners of the
<PB N="147" REF="144">world, it &s;eemed, with re&s;pect to him, to have lo&s;t its influence, for that he appeared to me to be quite a cynic, and a <HI>Hottentot,</HI> he admitted my ob&s;ervation to be ju&s;t. <Q>With all his learning and his knowledge,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>he is a bear in his manners, and looks down with an affected pity on men, who have little el&s;e than their rank or their fortune to di&s;|tingui&s;h them. The man of &s;ci|ence, will he often &s;ay, is a kind of intellectual being, whom the Creator has thought proper to il|lighten with &s;ome rays of his di|vinity, and in the &s;cale of hu|manity is truly <HI>great;</HI> whereas he who is di&s;tingui&s;hed only from the crowd by a title, is &s;carce more than a contemptible reptile, who envying the &s;uper-eminence of his
<PB N="148" REF="145">fellow-creature, &s;ues to his prince for that <HI>little</HI> trifling honour, which &s;elf-created dignity has to be&s;tow upon a para&s;ite; and when be&s;towed, affords the per&s;on on whom it is conferred, as little rea|&s;on to boa&s;t, as a favourite &s;paniel has, in the appellation of the high-&s;ounding names of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> or <HI>Pom|pey.</HI> So far is he from being a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, that he will de&s;pi&s;e and deride even tho&s;e who &s;erve him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>DR. Pompo&s;o was formerly a political writer, violent again&s;t the mini&s;try; and as he wrote with a keenne&s;s and &s;everity, that would have placed &s;ome men in the pillory; to &s;top his mouth, the mini&s;ter, who was a Scotch|man,
<PB N="149" REF="146">thought proper to pen&s;ion him: but this did not abate his animo&s;ity to the Scotti&s;h nation, to which he was an avowed enemy. A friend of his has &s;ince told me, that he accompanied him once to receive his pen&s;ion.</Q> <Q>Our con|ver&s;ation,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>all the way, was on the iniquity of employing Scotchmen in affairs of &s;tate; and Pompo&s;o was &s;o warm upon the &s;ubject, that he kept it up all the way we went; nay, he continued it even whil&s;t he was counting his money.</Q> <Q>One,&mdash;two,&mdash;five,&mdash;ten,&mdash;twenty.&mdash;The North Bri|ton,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A violent paper again&s;t admini&s;tration.</NOTE> &s;ays he, <Q>has been, how|ever, of &s;ome u&s;e:&mdash;Twenty-five,&mdash;twenty-eight;&mdash;it has turned one
<PB N="150" REF="147">d&mdash;mn'd Scotchman out of place:</Q> (this was the man that pen&s;ioned him)&mdash;<Q>Thirty,&mdash;thirty-five,&mdash;for|ty,&mdash;forty-five.&mdash;The&s;e ra&s;cals, I fear, will be the ruin of this country at la&s;t.</Q> <Q>And at this rate did he proceed, railing at, and abu&s;ing the people, to whom he was mo&s;t indebted. He had once been in the pay of the book&s;ellers, but being a &s;ingle man, who&s;e wants were but few, he &s;oon de|termined that a hireling writer is at be&s;t but a pro&s;titute, and when they would employ him no long|er, he dropped the profe&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>THE Marquis of G. called on me a few mornings after, and &s;aid the whole town rung with my commen|dation. He had a friend of his, he
<PB N="151" REF="148">&s;aid, who wi&s;hed to be acquainted with me, and if agreeable to me, he would attend me there to dinner. I accepted the invitation, and accom|panied him. This new acquaintance is a man (Lord W.) who, from making a great noi&s;e in the hou&s;e of commons, has been lately created and Iri&s;h baron. He has to boa&s;t of great moral virtue and good parts, but as much confin|ed in worldly knowledge, as is his walk in the broad way of life. He is ma&s;ter of etiquette, and the doctrine of courts no one knows better; but &s;o dim-&s;ighted is he in other re&s;pects, that he can &s;ee nothing beyond the blaze of maje&s;ty. Owing his eleva|tion in life, more to chance than fa|mily or connexions, and having but a circum&s;cribed fortune, he has lit|tle or no dignity, but what he owes
<PB N="152" REF="149">to the favour of his prince; of cour&s;e, the little rank he has, is the only thing on which he hangs, or depends for re&s;pect: and le&s;t any one about him &s;hould lo&s;e &s;ight of that rank, he is always talking of it, bringing it forward, and blazoning it abroad, and will not fail to tell you how gra|cious the king was on the la&s;t levee day. He affects to be a great man, and believes him&s;elf to be &s;o, but it is only as far as mimickry makes him. Thus, he puts me in mind of a poor gentleman, de&s;cended from one of the kings of Ireland, and who, wrapt up in his family pride, has retired into an ob&s;cure part of that country, with a patrimony of four &s;core pounds a year, and who, amid wretchedne&s;s and beggary, is &s;erved upon the knee, and never receives
<PB N="153" REF="150">any one, but he offers him his hand to ki&s;s. Indeed, the pride of the Iri&s;h is in&s;ufferable. The &s;ons of a gentleman are all bred up in that &s;tile, though the father's e&s;t|ate is &s;o &s;mall, as not to admit of his giving them a &s;hilling: hence they come over to England, and com|mence fortune-hunters. I once knew a baronet's widow who had two &s;ons; the elde&s;t took the family e&s;tate, about eight hundred pounds a year, but was obliged to pay his brother one thou|&s;and pounds on his mother's death, who had, during her life, a jointure of two hundred pounds a year out of this e&s;tate. An Engli&s;h gentleman of her acquaintance, who had for|merly been in bu&s;ine&s;s, advi&s;ed her lady&s;hip to put this younger &s;on into trade, and &s;ettle him in England;
<PB N="154" REF="151">but her family pride &s;tood in her way, and &s;he could not bring her&s;elf to think of it. Some time, however, afterwards, &s;he altered her mind; and as the provi&s;ion made for her younger &s;on was &s;o very &s;mall, and &s;he had not intere&s;t to get him any proper appointment, &s;he brought him to England, and applied to her friend who before advi&s;ed the mea|&s;ure. <Q>I begin now to think, Mr. Wi&s;eman,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>that the Engli&s;h are a better kind of peo|ple than repre&s;ented, and that trade is not &s;o de&s;picable as I once con|ceived; of cour&s;e, &s;hall have no objections to my &s;on's living among them, and entering into &s;ome com|mercial connexions. If you can meet with any re&s;pectable place, and fix him in &s;ome genteel bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="155" REF="152">that he can follow without di&s;credit, I &s;hall think my&s;elf obliged to you.</Q> This gentle|man, as a friend to the family, intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the matter, and took &s;ome pains to find out a hou&s;e, where, when the young gentleman had &s;erved his time, he might be re|ceived as a partner, and be likely, in a few years, to get a good fortune; and having found &s;uch a place, he flew with alacrity to the lady, and told her, in the warmth of his heart, how fortunate he had been. <Q>As I knew you was our friend,</Q> &s;ays her lady&s;hip, <Q>I conceived you the be&s;t per&s;on in the world to apply to in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Pray, Mr. Wi&s;eman, what is the profe&s;&s;ion?</Q> <Q>A bi&s;cuit-baker, Ma'am,</Q> &s;ays he. Panic-&s;truck at the word, <Q><HI>Bi&s;cuit-baker!</HI></Q>
<PB N="156" REF="153">&s;he cried out: <Q>Would you make Sir Harry Lofty's &s;on a <HI>bi&s;cuit-baker!</HI></Q> <Q>Why indeed, Madam,</Q> returns Mr. Wi&s;eman, piqued at her folly, <Q>I have rather mi&s;taken the matter here; I did not properly con&s;ider it.</Q> <Q>I was very &s;ure you had not,</Q> replies the lady, &s;oftening her voice, <Q>or a bi&s;cuit-baker could have never entered into your thoughts.</Q> <Q>Your lady&s;hip is perfectly right,</Q> &s;ays her friend: <Q>Had I thought well upon the &s;ubject, I never &s;hould have propo&s;ed it; for on fur|ther con&s;ideration, was the whole family e&s;tate to be realized, and con|verted into money, it would not be &s;ufficient to &s;et him up in bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q>&mdash;But to return to my narrave. If at any time Lord W. is fami|liar
<PB N="157" REF="154">with an inferior, it is when he 6 is not &s;een. The man he thinks proper to receive when in the coun|try, and pretends there to love and e&s;teem, he will be out of counten|ance at in public; he will &s;hun him when in London, and &s;carce hon|our him with a nod, if in company with men of rank. He will vi&s;it none in his neighbourhood that are not titled; and at times, is afaird to &s;toop his head to a tenant, for fear of committing him&s;elf. He will know no man that is not generally known, will follow nothing but incon&s;tancy, admire nothing but beauty, and honour nothing but fortune.

<P>To enter further into his character; he is &s;ervile to tho&s;e above him, and overbearing to tho&s;e below him. Before the learned he is dumb, and before the ignorant, loquacious and po&s;itive.

<P><PB N="160" REF="157">AT this nobleman's hou&s;e, I think I met with, next to him&s;elf, the mo&s;t &s;ingular character in life. A man in whom the two oppo&s;ite extremes of peace and war were united. He was a clergyman and at the &s;ame time a &s;oldier; <HI>miles at|que &s;acerdos,</HI> and went by the name Brigadier Mo&s;es. He was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;hort black &s;ilk ca&s;&s;ock, with a regimental coat over it, &s;carlet turned up with black and laced with gold. In&s;tead of the black &s;a&s;h or circingle which the clergy wear round their wai&s;t, he had a red &s;a&s;h, and above the gorget he wore upon his brea&s;t, was a clerical band. He had on his head, a brigadier wig with two tails; a &s;mart cock|ed gold-laced hat, with a cockade; a <HI>couteau de cha&s;&s;e</HI> by his &s;ide, and
<PB N="161" REF="158">a pair of &s;quare toed &s;hoes upon his feet. He was a dignitary of the church in Ireland, but had accepted the com|mand of a regiment of volunteers; and was as univer&s;ally re&s;pected as admired. He employed the whole week in teaching his men their ex|erci&s;e, and always preached to them on Sundays; and when he preach|ed, he drew his &s;abre and laid it on his arm, as if reading a pro|clamation. One of his &s;ermons has been handed round.&mdash;Part of it is as follows: <Q>Let us fight the good fight.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fellow chri&s;tians and &s;oldiers; Behold here your pa&s;tor and leader, armed in your defence, &s;tanding forth in <HI>your</HI> cau&s;e, as did my predece&s;&s;or Mo&s;es between
<PB N="162" REF="159"><HI>his</HI> people and the wrath of the Avenger; and be not &s;urpri&s;ed at it. A virtuous &s;oldier is the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character in life. En|li&s;ted under the banner of chri&s;|tianity, though only a private, he &s;hould take pride in wear|ing the uniform of the Lord of ho&s;ts. The chri&s;tian life is a life of warfare, be&s;ieged on all &s;ides, and be&s;et with perils; perils of water, perils of fire, and perils of the &s;word; but let us fight the good fight, and &s;tand firm again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of the common enemy; as we can|not hope to be well received at the general mu&s;ter, but through the &s;word of the &s;pirit, the &s;hield of faith, and the helmet of &s;al|vation,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="160">SO full was the Brigadier of his military profe&s;&s;ion, that he march|ed acro&s;s the room, in&s;tead of walk|ing; and, whenever he turned, he wheeled upon his heel. I found him a chearful good-natured man, and took the liberty to a&s;k him, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, <Q>whether he did not find the tenets of one profe&s;&s;ion interfere with that of the other?</Q> He told me not; <Q>that a prie&s;t was not only to be the father of his flock, but al&s;o their <HI>leader;</HI> that the author of our religion recommended a mi|litary life to his di&s;ciples.</Q> <Q>He that hath no <HI>&s;word,</HI></Q> &s;aid he, <Q>let him &s;ell his garment and buy one.</Q> <Q>When a &s;trong man, <HI>armed,</HI> keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace</Q> That the church was

It has been &s;aid that par&s;ons are cowards; we will now &s;hew them they have a &s;pirit equal to other men, and dare ri&s;e in a good cau&s;e. The Roman catho|lics,
<PB N="165" REF="162">who are bigots to their faith, held not the military pro|fe&s;&s;ion incompatible with the prie&s;thood. Cardinal Richlieu was a &s;oldier, and during his ad|mini&s;tration, the French army again&s;t Spain was commanded by a Bi&s;hop. I &s;o warmly covet the independence of my country, that as <HI>prayers</HI> will not effect it, I will meet my people in the field, and try what the <HI>&s;word</HI> can do.</Q> In &s;hort, he was &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;t in politics, that find|ing it was in vain to argue with him, I endeavoured to change the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE company pre&s;ent &s;eemed very de&s;irous of being of u&s;e to me. Lord W. wi&s;hed to appoint me his
<PB N="166" REF="163"><HI>literator,</HI> which office was to cull out the pith of every new publica|tion, and retail it to him at break|fa&s;t, for he was too indolent to read him&s;elf. The Brigadier was for my being his Aid de Camp; <Q>but for this office,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>you mu&s;t get into orders, for all the officers under me are clerical. My &s;ub-dean is my lieutenant-colonel; the chancel|lor of the dioce&s;e is my major; the prebendaries are my captains; the &s;ubalterns are the minor canons of the cathedral; the ad|jutant is our precentor, and all the non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers are made up of vergers, beadles, &amp;c. As to the common rank and file, there is nothing &s;piritual among them; if they deal at all in the
<PB N="167" REF="164"><HI>&s;pirit,</HI> it is in what goes into the mouth, not what comes out of it.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Marquis, who had al|ready pre&s;ented me with a pen&s;ion, gave me to under&s;tand, that he meant to be farther u&s;eful to me. He took me a&s;ide, and told me he had a favourite mea&s;ure to carry in par|liament, but as it was rather un|popular, he wi&s;hed me to take it up, and write in its favour; <Q>for,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>it mu&s;t be a bad cau&s;e indeed, that cannot be defend|ed.</Q> I found my&s;elf well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve him, and promi&s;ed him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power.</P>
<P>DURING this vi&s;it at Lord W.'s, which, indeed, I mentioned to have
<PB N="168" REF="165">an opportunity of laying before my readers two of the mo&s;t extraordi|nary characters I had met with, that of Lord W. him&s;elf, and his worthy friend the Brigadier. A letter was brought me by a porter, &s;aying, <Q>a gentleman had called at my hou&s;e with it that afternoon and de&s;ired it might be for|warded to me immediatly.</Q> I begged leave to open it, and found it to be written by my old friend, Mr. Sla&s;h'em, the vicar; of the pari&s;h where I was bred in Notts, and informed me, that my father's uncle was dead, and that his e&s;tate fell to me, as being the next on the entail; all the children of my father's elder brother having drop|ped off before him. I could not refrain from communicating this
<PB N="169" REF="166">peice of news to the company I was with, and they congratulated me upon the event. It is a&s;toni&s;h|ing to reflect on the immediate con&s;equence of a good fortune. I found in&s;tantly a difference in their behaviour. They were very polite and re&s;pectful before, but their at|tention to me rather carried a pa|tronizing air with it; they &s;hould always be happy to <HI>know</HI> me, and <HI>receive</HI> me; but the in&s;tant my for|tune was announced, we were up|on an equality; I mu&s;t come into parliament, a borough was open for me; and if I would &s;upport government, if &s;hould not co&s;t me but two thou&s;and pounds; every expence beyond that &s;um &s;hould be paid for me. I thanked them very kindly for their good wi&s;hes, but
<PB N="170" REF="167">begged &s;ome little time to con&s;ider of it. It is wonderful what a great alteration in our favour a good for|tune makes; it is far beyond edu|cation, ingenuity, or brilliancy of parts. Let a man pa&s;s by, ever &s;o meanly clad; ob&s;erve to your friend that he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth one hundred thou&s;and pounds, he &s;tares at him again and again, and looks on him as a prodigy. As when wealth and pro&s;perity for&s;ake a man, we di&s;cover in him, that want of under&s;tanding, which was undi&s;coverable before; &s;o when they &s;hine upon a per&s;on, we pre&s;ently &s;ee perfections in him, which no one was able to find out till then. So &s;trange a di&s;proportion does a little money or the want of it make between men! Mrs. Saintly, whil&s;t

<HEAD>Chap. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the informa|tion I received, I prepared to &s;et off for Nottingham&s;hire; but, as <HI>ill</HI> fortune too often chequers our <HI>good,</HI> an unexpected event happened, that overthrew all my mea&s;ures. Having left London pretty early in the morning, with a view of getting to the end of my journey before night, I found my&s;elf on the edge of Finchley Common, about &s;even miles from town, at &s;un ri&s;e, when
<PB N="173" REF="170">two men well mounted and armed, &s;topped my po&s;tillion; I had a load|ed blunderbu&s;s in the chai&s;e, and would certainly have di&s;charged the contents at them, had they not &s;creened them&s;elves from my ven|geance, by getting &s;o much before the lad, that had I fired I mu&s;t inevit|ably have killed him. I looked out for my &s;ervant, who was likewi&s;e armed, but he was not within &s;ight, and at this moment, two other men were behind the chai&s;e, and &s;wore, if I did not immediately throw out my blunderbu&s;s and &s;urrender, they would blow out my brains through my forehead, for they were not robbers, but King's officers. In this critical &s;ituation, I had no alterna|tive; I complied with their injunc|tions, and a&s;ked them what they
<PB N="174" REF="171">wanted. They gave me to under|&s;tand, that they had a warrant to apprehend me, and that I mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to go with them: that, if I was governable, they would u&s;e me well; but if I made any oppo&s;ition, they &s;hould be obliged to bind me. I a&s;ked them by what authority they acted, and what was the cau&s;e of my being &s;o &s;eized; they pro|duced a written paper, apparently a warrant, containing a charge of my having broken the peace, by chal|lenging the Earl of S. and attempt|ing to take away his life in Hyde Park. Scarce had they announced their bu&s;ine&s;s, but an empty po&s;t-chai&s;e came up, into which they in|&s;i&s;ted upon my removing, having fir&s;t &s;earched me for fire-arms; I begged they would permit me to
<PB N="175" REF="172">take my portmantua with me, which contained my nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;uffer me to wait for my &s;ervant, who was behind. They told me, they had &s;ecured my &s;ervant before they overtook me, and that he was taken back to town; that my luggage, which was not more than a few &s;hirts and a &s;econd coat, I might take with me, if I plea&s;ed, provided I would di&s;charge the po&s;t-chai&s;e in which I then was, &s;end my blun|derbu&s;s home by the driver, and go quietly with them. In this I ac|quie&s;ced, and a few minutes put me completely into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. One of the men got into the chai&s;e with me, two rode before, and the other brought up the rear, leading the hor&s;e of him who was &s;eated by me. I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to my new
<PB N="176" REF="173">companion &s;everal times, with <Q>where are you going to carry me?</Q> <Q>This is not the way to town</Q> and the like, (for I found they had quitted the north road, and had got into one I was unacquainted with) but I could get nothing from him; &s;o that I was obliged to abandon my&s;elf to my reflections, which were not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing I had experienced; for I conceived this (as I afterwards found it) a &s;econd attempt of Lord S. to kidnap me, which fortunately for him, &s;ucceeded better than the fir&s;t. I was hurried, as fa&s;t as the hor&s;es could go, acro&s;s the country, and in about three horus arrived at the Thames &s;ide, a little below Grays in E&s;&s;ex, where my fellow traveller, with great compo&s;ure, con&s;igned me
<PB N="177" REF="174">to the care of the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el lying off the &s;hore, and then ready to &s;ail. He now gave me to under|&s;tand, that I was obliged to the lenity of Lord S. for the di&s;po&s;al he was a going to make of me; for that, if I had been carried before a magi&s;trate, I &s;hould have had a much more di&s;agreeable lodging, as New|gate in that ca&s;e, would have been my place of re&s;idence for &s;ome time, and my exit would be at Tyburn; that, if I behaved well where I was going, his lord&s;hip would be always my friend; but that to live in the &s;ame land with me, he never could think of doing. I inquired the place the ve&s;&s;el was bound to, but could get no an&s;wer: finding there|fore, that I was likely to be ab&s;ent from home for &s;ome time, I reque&s;t|ed
<PB N="178" REF="175">leave to write a letter to a friend or two, to arrange my affairs, which my conductor con&s;ented to my do|ing, and promi&s;ed they &s;hould be faithfully delivered, provided he &s;aw the contents, and that they gave no information where I might be found. This being promi&s;ed, I was &s;uffered to go down into the cabin in com|pany with this &s;ame man, and write my letters. The fir&s;t I wrote was to Mr. Sla&s;h'em, the vicar, acknow|ledged the receipt of his, and to re|move any doubt of its being &s;ent, I told him, that as bu&s;ine&s;s of the highe&s;t importance obliged me to quit England for &s;ome time, and of cour&s;e, would prevent my being with him as I intended, I reque&s;ted and authorized him to take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as he &s;hould think nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="179" REF="176">to &s;ecure my property till my return, for which he &s;hould have my be&s;t thanks. I al&s;o de&s;ired him to take care of my hou&s;e and pro|perty in town, having left it with|out giving my &s;ervants any direc|tions, but that he would find my people obedient to his commands, as I had wrote home and ordered them &s;o to be.&mdash;The other letter I wrote, was to my hou&s;e-keeper in town, enjoining her to follow Mr. Sla&s;h|'em's directions, till &s;he &s;aw me. The&s;e letters my conductor was plea&s;ed to approve, and a&s;&s;ured me, they &s;hould be carefully conveyed according to the addre&s;&s;es. I beg|ged they might both be &s;ent expre&s;s, and he promi&s;ed they &s;hould.&mdash;I was now a little more at my ea&s;e, and flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould find
<PB N="180" REF="177">&s;ome means of regaining my liberty. My conductor and his attendants &s;hortly after took their leave, and wi&s;hed me a good voyage, and we &s;oon &s;et &s;ail.&mdash;The ve&s;&s;el I was in, was a &s;mall one of about one hun|dred tons burden, and our &s;hip's company con&s;i&s;ted of a Jew, (not a cabin pa&s;&s;enger) the ma&s;ter and five &s;eamen. The ve&s;&s;el did not &s;eem heavy laden, nor could I learn to what place &s;he was bound. The captain appeared to be a plain man, and of few words, and tho&s;e few he was ma&s;ter of, he &s;eemed to with|hold, for I could &s;carce get him to &s;peak.&mdash;I had rea&s;on, however, to believe, that he was appointed to carry me to &s;ome di&s;tant part, for I remarked, that in our pa&s;&s;age down the river, he kept at &s;ome di&s;tance
<PB N="181" REF="178">from &s;hore, where any town was near, and was careful not to go too clo&s;e to any ve&s;&s;el upon the river, le&s;t I &s;uppo&s;e, I might have been induced to call out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;The tide &s;erved, and the wind blowing bri&s;k, we were &s;oon at the Nore, and wi&s;hing for &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, I was pre&s;ently accommo|dated with what, at &s;ea, is thought a good dinner, (&s;alt beef and bi&s;cuit) but which I found very little appe|tite for: however, I eat a few mouthfuls, drank a little rum and water, and laid me down upon the bed in the cabin, where, with the fatigue I fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; my watch told me it was nine in the evening when I laid down, and when I a|woke, it was five in the morning. My &s;leep was rather broken, from a
<PB N="182" REF="179">bed I was unu&s;ed to, and the trou|bles of the day, but, broken as it was, it calmed my mind and gave me relief. I had now time to think, and nothing to interrupt me; the captain with his men were bu&s;y up|on deck, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;eemed go|ing very fa&s;t. On my a&s;cending from the cabin, I found we were on the open &s;ea, and out of &s;ight of land. A&s;king the captain where we were, he &s;aid in the Channel, (which I afterwards found was not true) and on my enquiring to what place he was bound, he replied to Nova Scotia. Having in my portmantua about fifty pounds in bank notes, and a diamond ring worth about as much, I determined to try the power of a bribe, and &s;ee whether I could not prevail on him to put me on
<PB N="183" REF="180">&s;hore &s;omewhere in England. Ac|cordingly, I reque&s;ted the favour of a quarter of an hour's conver&s;ation with him, the fir&s;t lei&s;ure he had. He &s;oon indulged me with it, and when together, I made him ac|quainted with my &s;ituation, and the whole hi&s;tory of Lord S.'s behavi|our to Mi&s;s Wildman and to me, and endeavoured to work upon his feelings, by repre&s;enting the treach|ery of his employer, and the cruelty with which he treated me. Whe|ther he believed me or not, I cannot &s;ay, but he li&s;tened with great at|tention, pau&s;ed when I had done, and when I expected him to have joined i&s;&s;ue with me, he ro&s;e from his &s;eat and was going to leave me, with, <Q>if he is as bad-conditioned, me&s;&s;mate, as you &s;ay, d-m me if
<PB N="184" REF="181">the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el &s;hould hold us; you may be happy you're &s;hipped off for another country;</Q> I im|portuned him to &s;tay, told him I was ma&s;ter of fifty pounds, and a ring worth as much more, that, if he would put me a&s;hore in &s;ome part of England, or on board &s;ome ve&s;&s;el going there, both &s;hould be at his &s;ervice; at which he grew warm&mdash;<Q>a bribe!</Q> exclaimed he, <Q>did you ever know an Engli&s;h &s;eaman run from his colours, or betray his cau&s;e for a bribe, d-m me, they &s;hall never &s;ay that of Jack Haw&s;er.</Q> Not betray a <HI>good</HI> cau&s;e, replied I, but there's merit &s;urely, in overturning a <HI>bad</HI> one. <Q>Harkee, me&s;&s;mate&mdash;that's the commodore's look out; my orders are to make for Nova Sco|tia,
<PB N="185" REF="182">and there you go, my friend, unle&s;s we bulge in the pa&s;&s;age.</Q> At this he left me, crying to the man at the helm, <Q>luff up my lad,</Q> and to the man forward, <Q>hoi&s;t the main top &s;ail; and we'll make all the way we can.</Q>&mdash;<Q>D-m me, here's a fine breeze.</Q></P>
<P>I BEGAN now, to think of my poor Eliza and her little infant, and for the fir&s;t time, found a &s;atisfac|tion in reflecting they were out of the reach of being affected by <HI>my</HI> misfortunes. <Q>Whatever is, is be&s;t;</Q> &s;o &s;ays philo&s;ophy: here &s;he is right. Had my Eliza been living, &s;he would not only have felt this accident &s;everely, but I &s;hould have <HI>doubly</HI> felt it; have felt for <HI>her</HI> as well as for my&s;elf. She, how|ever,
<PB N="186" REF="183">thought I, is happy, and why &s;hould I be otherwi&s;e? My property is &s;afe in Mr. Sla&s;h'em's care, and as I am in health, and &s;tand alone in life, what matters it, whether I am going to Nottingham, or Nova Sco|tia? I have encountered many a difficulty, and overcome them all.&mdash;Providence has hitherto protected me&mdash;why &s;hould I di&s;tru&s;t her now?</P>
<P>I WAS led once or twice, when the captain was below, to endeavour to bring over the &s;ailors to my in|tere&s;t, but con&s;idering, that had I not &s;ucceeded, the captain might have rendered my &s;ituation far more di&s;agreeable than it was, I thought it be&s;t to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="184">THE next day, an accident hap|pened that extricated me from my difficulty. The ve&s;&s;el, owing to the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the &s;teer&s;man, &s;truck upon a bank, and &s;prung a leak. <Q>All hands to the pump, or by G&mdash;d, we are at the bottom,</Q> was the cry&mdash;but, it was the cry of one of the forema&s;t men: di&s;agree|able as my &s;ituation was before, it was much wor&s;e now. We were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;even leagues from land, and the &s;ea run too high, to think our&s;elves in any &s;afety&mdash;the ve&s;&s;el made water &s;o fa&s;t, that the ma&s;ter de&s;paired of &s;aving her; however, he con&s;oled him&s;elf in the idea of being in&s;ured more than &s;he was worth, and determined to take to his boat. <Q>We may pump her to land,</Q> &s;ays one of the &s;ailors,

The boat <HI>was</HI> hoi&s;ted out, and being to &s;mall to take any part of our baggage, we were obliged to leave it behind; in|deed, &s;o frightened was I, having never been at &s;ea before, that I thought little of my baggage; <HI>my</HI> attention was confined to my per&s;on.

In about four hours we &s;aw land, and it gave us &s;pirits; and another hour put us on &s;hore at a little village on the coa&s;t of North|umberland, not a great way &s;outh of Berwick. I now found, in&s;tead
<PB N="191" REF="188">of &s;teering for Nova Scotia, the ve&s;|&s;el I was in, and which &s;unk be|fore we were a league from it, was a lob&s;ter &s;mack, bound for Shet|land, where his lord&s;hip meant to have tran&s;ported me, and where I &s;hould not have readily got away.</P>
<P>MY comrades glad to find them|&s;elves on land, made the be&s;t of their way to Newca&s;tle, in order to &s;hip them&s;elves on board &s;ome of the colliers, whereas I took up my abode at a public hou&s;e in the vil|lage, determining to wait till I could have remittances from London; for I had brought nothing a&s;hore with me, of any value but may watch, which I converted into money to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent exigence. I might, indeed, have told my tale
<PB N="192" REF="189">to &s;ome of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, and by that means got &s;ome pecuniary relief; but as I wi&s;hed to &s;it quiet for a few days, to recover from my fatigue and anxiety of mind, I thought it be&s;t to lay my&s;elf under as few obliga|tions as po&s;&s;ible. Before the &s;ailors left me, I made &s;ome enquiry whether they knew any thing of their Captain or his connexions; they told me not, that they were &s;hip|ped merely for the voyage and were &s;trangers to him, till a few days before I came on board. All the information I could get was, that they had lain at anchor, on the &s;pot where I found them, two days waiting for may arrival.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XXV.</HEAD>
<P>BY the time I had been at this place a week, I had &s;uch re|mittances from my banker as I &s;tood in need of, and had heard from home, that all things were well. I then equipped my&s;elf with tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries I wanted, namely, a few &s;hirts and a &s;uit of cloaths, and prepared to &s;et off once more, took a po&s;t chai&s;e for Nottingham|&s;hire. Though anxious to call the Earl of S. to account for the treat|ment
<PB N="194" REF="191">I had received, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to pay a vi&s;it to my friend the vicar; and the reader may believe me, when I &s;ay, that I found my&s;elf le&s;s eager to take this journey now, than I was, when I left London on the &s;ame occa&s;ion; my expectations were balked by the event I have related, and my &s;pirits were not &s;o much upon the wing; howerer, I &s;et out and reached York the fir&s;t night.</P>
<P>THE theatre being there open, I went to the play, and who &s;hould I meet with in the &s;ame box, but Biddy Sla&s;h'em, dre&s;&s;ed out with a profu&s;ion of diamonds, in company with an old gentleman, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be her keeper. She was overjoyed to &s;ee me, and intro|duced
<PB N="195" REF="192">me to Mr. Dupe, the gentle|man with her, as the &s;on of her father's brother, whom &s;he had be|fore repre&s;ented as a clergyman of the fir&s;t character and fortune. He received me very cordially, and, when the play was over, begged to have the honour of my company to &s;upper, having a hou&s;e in the town. I accompanied them home in their carriage, and was reque&s;ted whil&s;t I continued at York, to &s;leep there. This gave me an opportu|nity of pa&s;&s;ing an hour or two alone with Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, Mr. Dupe be|ing accu&s;tomed to ride out every morning before breakfa&s;t, upon a hard trotting hor&s;e, for the cure of a gouty complaint he had in his &s;to|mach. The Jew <HI>Doctor</HI> and <HI>Black|&s;mith</HI> in London, having by his
<PB N="196" REF="193">machine to create mu&s;cular exerci&s;e, made &s;uch a regimen fa&s;hionable. This machine, I am told, is merely a board (on which the patient &s;tands, holding by an iron) with &s;prings under it, worked by an hand|winch which rai&s;es and lowers it &s;o quick, that in a &s;mall &s;pace of time, it throws the per&s;on on it into a violent per&s;piration, and gives him all the advantages of great ex|erci&s;e, without mu&s;cular exertion: a trotting hor&s;e will an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e, if the rider can undergo the fatigue. During Mr. Dupe's morning ride, I had the happine&s;s of a tete-a-tete in Biddy's chamber, and found her as attached to me as ever. I gave her &s;ome little ac|count of my adventures &s;ince we
<PB N="197" REF="194">parted; and &s;he in return, related to me the &s;equel of her's.</P>
<P><Q>WHEN you left us, my dear Gabriel,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>at Win|che&s;ter, we were preparing to remove to the Devizes; there I continued about three weeks, when Mr. Dupe, the gentleman I live with, &s;eeing me in one of my principal characters in his way from Bath to London, took a liking to me, and made me pro|po&s;als to live with him. The&s;e proving acceptable, I took leave of the company, quitted my employ, and came away with him. He has &s;ettled two hundred pounds a year on me, loads me with pre&s;ents, and &s;ays he'll marry me if I prove with child.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="195"><Q>And you, no doubt,</Q> &s;ays I <Q>try every means you can for it.

It has been the means of introducing me into the be&s;t company; for, &s;o affectedly fond are per&s;ons of fa&s;hion of mu&s;ic, that they will &s;acrifice every thing to the rage of it. The gentry in this part of the country, readily overlook my &s;ituation, for the &s;ake of my voice, and I vi&s;it and am vi&s;ited by every body round me. Nay, I a&s;&s;ure you I give
<PB N="199" REF="196">my&s;elf great airs upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions, and find the more <HI>box</HI> I take upon me, the more I am thought of. I never pay a vi&s;it, till I have fir&s;t received one; nor does Mr. Dupe expect me. The Dutche&s;s of D. and the Counte&s;s of R. her &s;i&s;ter, did us the hon|our to drink tea with us ye&s;ter|day.

<PB N="200" REF="197">and all the company's &s;itting down upon the floor but my&s;elf; for no|thing flattens the &s;ound of a voice more than drapery furniture, and a number of per&s;ons half fill|ing a room.</Q> <Q>And do they &s;ubmit to this?</Q> replied I, <Q>Cer|tainly they do,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>and they <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> or I would not &s;ing. They would half &s;trip them&s;elves if I required it, rather than the world &s;hould fancy, they have not the greate&s;t <HI>penchant</HI> for mu|&s;ick. I know they vi&s;it and re|ceive me, merely for my &s;inging, and that though they bear with my oddities, they only laugh at me when gone; this determines me to laugh in my turn, and as Mr. Dupe will not &s;uffer me to receive any per&s;ents, I am deter|mined
<PB N="201" REF="198">they &s;hall pay for their folly one way or other.</Q> Though I &s;miled at the conceit, I could not but agree with her, that of all follies the <HI>toni&s;h</HI> or fa&s;hionable ones, are the mo&s;t ab&s;urd. <Q>I'll tell you an anecdote, my dear Biddy,</Q> returned I, <Q>that will confirm my a&s;&s;ertion. Among the many people I have mixed with &s;ince I left you, is the lady of Sir Peter Puncheon, a Creole, from Jamai|ca. Sir Peter had been formerly in trade, had afterwards turned planter, and acquired a good for|tune. His lady being a woman of da&s;h and &s;pirit, per&s;uaded him to leave Jamaica and &s;ettle in England. They accordingly &s;old all off and came, and not having a &s;oul to introduce them into
<PB N="202" REF="199">that company &s;he coveted, &s;he fell upon the following plan which &s;ucceeded beyond her expectati|ons. Having a large hou&s;e in London well &s;ituated, &s;he called for the <HI>red book,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commonly called the Court Calendar.</NOTE> and from a li&s;t &s;he there picked out, and other information, &s;ent cards of invi|tation to a concert and a ball, to all the rout-going men and women of rank, to the number of &s;ome hundreds, and &s;uch was the rage for going to this woman's hou&s;e, that many who by acci|dent were not invited made inter|e&s;t for a card; &s;o that on the evening appointed, there was &s;uch a throng of coaches and chairs, that all the adjoining &s;treets were
<PB N="203" REF="200">full. She procured a very intel|ligent &s;ervant, acquainted with their names, to announce them as they arrived, &s;he &s;tanding on the top of the &s;tairs, with her hu&s;band, to receive them. In the early part of the evening when they dropped in but thinly, &s;he had lei&s;ure to receive them properly; and expre&s;&s;ed how proud &s;he was of the honour they did her; but in a very little time, they poured in &s;o thick upon her, that it requir|ed three men below to announce them, and would have required a regi&s;ter to have remembered their names. It was a ta&s;k beyond her reach, and &s;he could only introduce them to her hu&s;band in the lump, with</Q> <Q>a Baronet, my dear; two more Lords; a Red ribband, and &s;o on.</Q>
<Q><PB N="204" REF="201">&mdash;From this &s;cheme &s;he immedi|ately became a woman of the <HI>ton,</HI> and her hou&s;e, from that time, was the fa&s;hionable re&s;ort of the fir&s;t people in town. They ad|mired her invention, whil&s;t they laughed at her impudence; but they continued to vi&s;it her not|with&s;tanding: for the time of per&s;ons of fa&s;hion hang &s;o much upon their hands, and they enjoy &s;o little of what the rational world calls &s;ocial and dome&s;tic &s;ociety, that they would run to h&mdash;, I believe, if the black gen|tleman would open his hou&s;e with a concert, a ball, or a card party. By this means &s;he was readily known and received in the great world, and very &s;oon procured her hu&s;band to be created a Bar|onet.
<PB N="205" REF="202">This brought them to court, and as people devoid of ele|gance, idlely &s;uppo&s;e that richne&s;s of dre&s;s depends upon profu&s;ion, or an extra quantity of expen&s;ive attire; in&s;tead of appearing in two laced lappets, lady Puncheon was determined to have four. It &s;o fell out, however, that four lap|pets to a head dre&s;s being contrary to etiquette, &s;he was refu&s;ed admittance, 'till Sir Peter &s;et the matter right, by taking out a pair &s;cizars and cutting off two of them. But as the two he cut off were on <HI>one</HI> &s;ide, &s;he became the laugh and ridicule of the whole drawing room.</Q></P>
<P>BIDDY was delighted with this &s;tory and vowed &s;he would put it in prac|tice
<PB N="206" REF="203">as &s;oon as &s;he got to London. <Q>Do,</Q> &s;ays I, <Q>Biddy, and I'll be bound you'll have company enough. Character and connexion is out of the que&s;tion. Open your hou&s;e, and the bu&s;ine&s;s is done.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Dupe &s;oon after returned from his morning's ride and found us in his bed chamber. It a little di&s;|concerted us; but he quickly put us at our ea&s;e, with, <Q>&s;o, my dear Bid|dy, you <HI>would</HI> &s;hew your cou&s;in my knotted bed.</Q> Shaking his head at her, and chucking her under the chin. <Q>Ah, you little rogue, you are determined I &s;hall not lo&s;e any credit that you can give me.</Q> Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me. <Q>I knotted the greate&s;t part of that fringe my&s;elf, Mr. Whatd'ye-call 'em (I can't think of your name)
<PB N="207" REF="204">and I am not a&s;hamed to own it; it's better than gallop|ing a whole county over after a fox, injuring one's tenants and running the chance of breaking one's neck. Come, Sir, walk down and &s;ee my improvements.</Q> <Q>I thanked him for his politene&s;s to me; but told him, I mu&s;t be going, for that, I had engage|ments of the fir&s;t importance that called me into Nottingham&s;hire.</Q> <Q>Well, Sir,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>then I'll leave you together&mdash;you may have &s;ome little affair to enter in|to, that requires privacy. I beg, Biddy, you'll &s;hew your cou|&s;in all the civility you can.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE day after I parted with Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em, I got &s;afe to her un|cle's hou&s;e in Notts, and happy I was to &s;ee him; nor did he &s;hew le&s;s happine&s;s in &s;eeing me. It was now about three weeks &s;ince I left Lon|don, with a de&s;ign of coming to this place; and I think, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, no one met with a greater variety of incidents. I rela|ted the &s;tory to him; but not a word of his niece. <Q>Ah,</Q> &s;ays he,
<PB N="209" REF="206"><Q>you &s;ee how kind and protecting the Almighty is; not a &s;parrow falls to the ground without his ob&s;ervance! Lord S. is a very bad man; and I hope you will be able to bring the matter home to him</Q> <Q>That I certainly &s;hall,</Q> &s;ays I; <Q>for the redre&s;s I &s;hall look for, &s;hall be a per&s;onal one.</Q> As a clergyman, and a very worthy one, he made u&s;e of every argument to di&s;&s;uade me from &s;uch a &s;tep; but the injuries I had received were &s;o great, that they had but little weight with me. I therefore turned the &s;ubject, and enquired whether he had received my letter. He told me he had, and by an expre&s;s the day after it was written. So far tho&s;e fellows who forced me on board the ve&s;&s;el, acted well. He gave me to
<PB N="210" REF="207">under&s;tand, that my uncle had made a will, &s;ometime before he died, and had left great part of his property to my cou&s;ins; but as he out-lived them, the legacies were lap&s;ed, and all the per&s;onals fell to me, with the entailed e&s;tate; that he having no relations to be found, and the execu|tor he had appointed in his will, being al&s;o decea&s;ed, letters of admi|ni&s;tration were granted to him at his reque&s;t, and he was ready to put me into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion immediately. <Q>I have,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>made many enquiries, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, about you, but could het no &s;a|tisfactory intelligence; however, &s;ince the death of your uncle, I have been more indu&s;trious in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and have found you out. What was nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="211" REF="208">be done in your ab&s;ence, has been done; &s;uch as taking an inven|tory of the effects, and properly &s;ecuring them; and I tru&s;t you will find every thing in as good order as circum&s;tances admitted. With re&s;pect to your hou&s;e in town, I wrote to your hou&s;ekeeper, as you de&s;ired; directed her to put the &s;ervants upon board wages, and when &s;he wanted any money, to apply to a friend of mine in London, whom I commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;upply her.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER thanking the vicar for his care, and the trouble he had taken, we went together to the man&s;ion, when he gave me po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the keys. In my uncle's cabinet I found near five hundred pounds in bank
<PB N="212" REF="209">notes and ca&s;h, and a memorandum, &s;aying that he had twelve thou&s;and pounds in the funds, and in what funds they lay. Having adju&s;ted every thing for the pre&s;ent, vi&s;ited the tenants, and left proper per&s;ons in the hou&s;e, I pre&s;ented Mr. Sla&s;h'em with a bank note of two hundred pounds, for the trouble I had given him, which he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed; but which I in&s;i&s;ted on his receiving, and further promi&s;ed, that if it was ever in my power to be of u&s;e to him, I &s;hould neither forget it, nor omit it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I left his hou&s;e, he was very anxious to know how I had di&s;po&s;ed of my&s;elf &s;ince I left his part of the world; and con&s;idering him as my friend, I gave him a mi|nute
<PB N="213" REF="210">detail of every thing, except &s;uch parts as related to his niece, who, I found, had been entirely di&s;carded by the family. His bro|ther, the doctor, was, I learned, &s;till at Hamp&s;tead, and doing very well.</P>
<P>THE Vicar was wonderfully enter|tained with my hi&s;tory, but di&s;ap|proved much of &s;ome part of my conduct. However, he pre&s;umed I had &s;een my error, and as now I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good fortune, he flat|tered him&s;elf, I &s;hould live a more regular life. <Q>This hi&s;tory of your|&s;elf,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>convinces me, that nothing is like giving a lad a good education; this will &s;tick by him when every thing el&s;e fails; enable him to &s;urmount every diffi|culty,
<PB N="214" REF="211">and carry him through life in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>UPON examining the rental of my uncle's e&s;tate, I found it amount to a good four thou&s;and three hundred pounds a year; which, with the in|tere&s;t of twelve thou&s;and pounds in the &s;tocks, the three hundred pounds a year I enjoyed from my wife, and my pen&s;ion, &amp;c. I had an income equal to near five thou&s;and four hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>I NOW &s;et off for London, which I reached the next morning, and on my arrival at my own hou&s;e, found every thing as I wi&s;hed it. My &s;er|vants, poor &s;ouls, were as glad to &s;ee me, as I was to &s;ee them. I told them how I had been trepan|ned,
<PB N="215" REF="212">but not by whom; and that it was a chance of the highe&s;t im|probability, that ever they &s;aw me again. They &s;aid, the town was very &s;ilent then on the &s;ubject, for they had heard nothing of it before. As to the lad that accompanied me to Finchly, I &s;uppo&s;e they &s;ent him aboard a man of war, for I never heard of him afterwards.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t vi&s;it I paid was to the Marquis of G. who received me very friendly, and to whom I related my &s;tory, and that I meant to call Lord S. to a very &s;evere account for his behaviour. His an&s;wer was, <Q>That bu&s;ine&s;s is already &s;ettled; Lord S. has done it him&s;elf.</Q> I reque&s;ted an explanation. He told me, that I was no &s;ooner &s;eized, but that
<PB N="216" REF="213">Lord S. called upon him, and boa&s;t|ed of what he had done; <Q>&s;aid he had you &s;topped under a fictitious warrant, and had tran&s;ported you to Shetland; for that after di&s;|arming him, as you had done, in the affair in Hyde Park, he could never brook the idea of owing his life to you, and of cour&s;e, could never bear to &s;ee you again; and that news arriving of the ve&s;&s;el being ca&s;t away, and the crew &s;aved, he dreaded your return to town, and had accordingly put an end to his exi&s;tence with a pi&s;tol. The matter,</Q> continued he, <Q>as he is not mi&s;&s;ed, is not much talked of: it were better, therefore, to let it &s;leep, as reviv|ing it will be of no u&s;e to you, and may hurt the feelings of his
<PB N="217" REF="214">family; who, notwith&s;tanding the faults of Lord S. is a very re&s;pectable one. As to his a|gents in this bu&s;ine&s;s, they are wretches below your notice, could not po&s;&s;ibly owe you any ill will, being villains that would be as ready, for a little money, to do as much for you as for him.</Q></P>
<P>HIS lord&s;hip's arguments had their due weight with me, and I determi|ned to follow his advice. Though I execrated the conduct of Lord S. I dropped a tear at his fatal exit, and there the matter ended. How tri|fling a character is that of a man of fa&s;hion, and how convinced mu&s;t a per&s;on be, that he is a u&s;ele&s;s being in life, when he con&s;iders that at his
<PB N="218" REF="215">death, he leaves a world that will not mi&s;s him!</P>
<P>THE marquis, among other things, told me, his Maje&s;ty had appointed him prime mini&s;ter, and of all things, he &s;hould be happy if I would accept the &s;ecretary&s;hip to the Trea&s;ury; that he was well acquainted with my abilities, and knew I &s;hould fill the office well; that he would open a borough for me, and I &s;hould be returned without trouble. I thank|ed his lord&s;hip for the honour he did me, and told him, that as I now &s;tood &s;ingle in life, and had no dome&s;tic concerns to take off my at|tention, I would accept the office cheerfully. Accordingly, I was &s;oon after appointed, and returned for a mini&s;terial borough: and the
<PB N="219" REF="216">fir&s;t &s;atisfaction I derived from this employ, was having it in my power to do a hand&s;ome thing by my friend the Vicar. The marquis told me, about &s;ix months after I had been in office, that a rectory in the gift of the crown, and in the neigh|bourhood of my e&s;tate in Notting|ham&s;hire, of the yearly valuel of &s;ix hundred pounds a year and upwards, with a good hou&s;e upon it, had fal|len vacant, and that if I had any friend in that part of the world, whom I wi&s;hed to &s;erve, it &s;hould be at my di&s;po&s;al. I readily embraced the offer, thanked him for his po|litene&s;s, and gave it to Mr. Sla&s;h|'em, it being within di&s;tance, and tenable with the church he then held. This was the fir&s;t good office of any magnitude, that I had ever
<PB N="220" REF="217">in my power to perform; and if it be not vanity to &s;ay it, I will own, that it gave me a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, and one &s;o great, that I pined for an op|portunity of doing a &s;econd. I am per&s;uaded, that tho&s;e who do good, will believe the truth of this a&s;&s;er|tion, and think there is more real gratification in giving than receiv|ing. With a heart warmed by love and gratitude, my friend Sla&s;h'em waited on me to expre&s;s his ac|knowledgements for the &s;ervice I had done him, and I felt at the moment all the &s;elf-complacency, which a favour cheerfully and un|expectedly be&s;towed, and thankfully received, communicates to the feel|ing heart of the donor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>WAS I to de&s;cribe to my readers the arduous ta&s;k of the office I filled, I am per&s;uaded none of them would envy my &s;ituation. Be|&s;ides my official bu&s;ine&s;s at the Trea&s;ury, though I was &s;aid to be the right hand of the mini&s;ter, I was ab&s;olutely his &s;lave: I was expected to &s;upport in the Hou&s;e of Commons all he did, or wi&s;hed to do, without any concurrence of my own, and at times, when alone, was obliged, like
<PB N="222" REF="219">a mercenary barri&s;ter, to &s;tudy for arguments to throw out in the Hou&s;e, in defence of mea&s;ures I di&s;approved, and which I inwardly condemned. My colleagues in office, the mar|quis would &s;ometimes &s;mile and &s;ay, were not up to the ta&s;k, and that admini&s;tration could not do without me. To a good pair of lungs, Na|ture had be&s;towed upon me a power|ful harmonious voice, and ble&s;&s;ed me with a &s;trong memory beyond what men in general can boa&s;t of: as the&s;e are natural talents, I may mention them without vanity, and if I did not turn them to the be&s;t of purpo&s;es, it was that I had accepted an office, I could not, for certain rea&s;ons, immediately relinqui&s;h; and it fell to the holder of that office to &s;upport the conduct of his employer;
<PB N="223" REF="220">and, as there is always an oppo&s;ition in Parliament, and I hope, for the good of this country there ever will, be the motives of that oppo&s;ition what they may, it is nece&s;&s;ary for men in office, if they wi&s;h to carry their point, to labour to overthrow tho&s;e arguments that are brought again&s;t them; &s;ometimes the&s;e ar|guments are &s;trong ones, and re|quire a great deal of fallacious rea|&s;oning to combat; but whether a cau&s;e be right or wrong, the parti|&s;ans of oppo&s;ition will cavil at it, and it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of admini&s;tra|tion to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch cavilling. So little regard is paid to the abilities of repre&s;entatives, that the major part of them are very weak men, and are led away by the la&s;t &s;peaker; it is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore,
<PB N="224" REF="221">if po&s;&s;ible, that men in office &s;hould have the la&s;t word, and this is what I always contended for. I was the only one in admini&s;tration, they &s;aid, that had temper and con&s;titution enough to bear badgering, and be|lieve me I had enough of it. The mar|quis was a man that meant well, and was not without his &s;hare of under|&s;tanding; but he could not always carry things his own way: he was brought into the office he held, by the party with whom he was con|nected, and on that account was obliged frequently to give up his opinion to their's; but as he was the o&s;ten&s;ible per&s;on, it was my bu&s;ine&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, to e&s;tabli&s;h the rectitude of every mea&s;ure he was obliged to e&s;pou&s;e, right or wrong. Under this idea, was a new office to
<PB N="225" REF="222">be appointed, for the pu&s;po&s;e of gratifying a particular family or connexion, I was to ju&s;tify the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of that office; if new works were to be erected or new contracts entered into, more with a de&s;ign to enrich the erector or contractor, than any public utility; I was to argue the matter down the throats of the yea and nay members; if the civil li&s;t was in arrears, and money was wanting to di&s;charge them, I was to &s;hew the inadequatene&s;s of the e&s;tabli&s;hment to the expences annexed to it, that it was nece&s;&s;ary the dignity of the crown &s;hould be kept up, and that the arrears were unavoidable; if a negotiation abroad was to take place, in behalf of any family alliance or any favourite mea&s;ure, I was to colour it in the
<PB N="226" REF="223">be&s;t method I could, and give it an appearance of expediency; in &s;hort, a re&s;pectable majority was to be carried upon every motion, and it re&s;ted upon me to do it. It re|quired ingenuity, it required labour; but I knew it was to be done, and never failed in the attempt: I made it a point to canvas the members, where I had any doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, and when I found they were not to be brought over by argument, I had recour&s;e to temptation; and, as Sir Robert Walpole u&s;ed to &s;ay, I found every man had his price. I have often thought, that was a member of the Hou&s;e, who wi&s;hed to &s;peak, obliged to come forward and &s;tand under a large extingui&s;her, drawn up by a pulley, the &s;tring of which &s;hould be within the reach of the
<PB N="227" REF="224">Speaker; he might, whenever he wandered from the &s;ubject, or was out of order, let it down upon the ora|tor, and put an end to his harangue: it would &s;ave a great deal of wrangling; a great deal of that time which is now taken up in fal&s;e logic and per&s;onal invective. But I beg the reader's pardon for this digre&s;&s;ion. I carried on this di&s;|agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s too long, and was at la&s;t determined, if I could not have &s;ome direction in political matters, not to be the &s;lave of tho&s;e in power, and make my tongue always a traitor to my heart. My re&s;olutions on this head I commu|nicated to the marquis; and my &s;ervices were &s;o u&s;eful, that I was appointed a Secretary of State and admitted into the cabinet. This I
<PB N="228" REF="225">found to be a cabal indeed, and his Maje&s;ty to be merely a cypher; I felt for his &s;ituation, and in every thing there debated, where I could with any degree of ju&s;tne&s;s and pro|priety throw the weight into his &s;cale, I did. Had the members of that cabinet been moderate and ra|tional men, we might all have been unanimous; for as I had no mea|&s;ures to carry, but what were in my opinion con&s;i&s;tent with the pub|lic good, I never ob&s;tinately con|tended in a bad cau&s;e: but every one did not think as I thought, and as I was of the King's party, as far as I could be with any propriety, and when I thought a mea&s;ure wrong did not ea&s;ily give up my opinion, the cabinet was di&s;tracted, and I mu&s;t either retire or they
<PB N="229" REF="226">would; in a word, I was too power|fully &s;upported not to keep my &s;eat: the cabinet was di&s;&s;olved, a new admini&s;tration formed, my friend the marquis re&s;igned his office in my favour, and I had the honour to be appointed.</P>
<P>WHETHER things went on better or not, whil&s;t I was at the head of the Trea&s;ury, I will not take upon me to &s;ay, but they went on much &s;moother. I became the o&s;ten&s;ible man, and when I &s;tood up in defence of any &s;tep, my tongue and my heart went together. I found this office, like the other I held, a very invidious one; that every thing I did was cavil|led at and di&s;approved; and that from the number of appointments in my di&s;po&s;al, I was harra&s;&s;ed to death,
<PB N="230" REF="227">and could &s;carce have the u&s;e of my own eyes or my own ears, but was always open to mi&s;repre&s;entation and deception. After I had held my office for two years, I hand&s;omely re&s;igned it. The only advantage my office was to me (if it may be called an advantage) was the number of friends it procured me. For years before I &s;tood in the world, without a relation, without a connexion: now I might have had as many as I plea&s;ed. Some introduced them&s;elves to me on a former acquaintance, (but which I could not recollect); &s;ome as being &s;choolfellows or neighbours; and &s;ome as fellow travellers; and others would ran&s;ack their genealogy, to find out &s;ome degree of kindred to me. All were a&s;&s;iduous to plea&s;e me, all indu&s;trious to &s;erve me; but I
<PB N="231" REF="228">had then places and good things to give away. All this, however, was no gratification. I found the getting rid of the drudgery of franking, as great a relaxation as any thing. Many a hot day have I &s;lipped off my coat, and franked away as for life; and it was no &s;mall vexation to think that I could not oblige my con&s;tituents, without giving my pa&s;&s;port to &s;uch a world of non&s;en&s;e as my covers contained. Butt he greate&s;t plea&s;ure I received was in acts of benevolence. I &s;eldom li&s;tened to the recommen|dations of this great man, or the re|mon&s;trances of that, (on which ac|count I had many enemies) but gave what was in the di&s;po&s;al of my de|partment, as I conceived would be&s;t an&s;wer the de&s;ign of the appoint|ment, and do the mo&s;t private good.
<PB N="232" REF="229">I never amu&s;ed a petitioner, as cour|tiers do, with fal&s;e hopes and ex|pectancies, or buoyed him up with fallacious promi&s;es, which cruelly tend to make his di&s;appointment the greater. If I could &s;erve him, and meant to do it, I always did; if I did not mean it, I frankly told him &s;o. I &s;tood in no danger of being &s;erved as the commander in chief was, by a lieutenant in the army, who had lo&s;t his leg in the &s;ervice, and who had been warmly recom|mended to him for a company of invalids: he had amu&s;ed this poor man for twelve months, and kept him in London at an expence he could not &s;upport. Quite wearied out with attending, he took an op|portunity one day at his levee, as by accident, to tread upon this great
<PB N="233" REF="230">man's corns with his wooden &s;tump, and put him to great pain. Much concern was expre&s;&s;ed at the acci|dent, many &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive apologies made, and the matter was forgiven but not forgotten; for whenever this gentleman entered his levee after|wards, he took care to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by &s;tumping loudly acro&s;s the room, which always created an alarm, and le&s;t he &s;hould tread upon the commander's toes again, he was pre&s;ently provided for. I never &s;uf|fered a per&s;onal application from any one, but gave it out that every peti|tion &s;hould be in writing, and to the&s;e I be&s;towed a very nice attention; him whom I thought be&s;t de&s;erving and mo&s;t adequate to the office to be fil|led, I generally preferred; but I frequently &s;et a&s;ide every applicant
<PB N="234" REF="231">in favour of mode&s;t men of abilities; who, through want of connexions, had no friends to intercede for them, or who&s;e merit had been too ob&s;cured to be noticed by the public eye. The art of &s;aying <HI>no,</HI> without hurt|ing the per&s;on you &s;ay it to, is one of the fir&s;t accompli&s;hments in life; few men know how to do it; and I would per&s;uade my&s;elf it ari&s;es from a good natured di&s;po&s;ition, unwilling to refu&s;e what is a&s;ked. It is related of the late D. of N. that he was &s;o accu&s;tomed to pro|mi&s;e, that no applicant whatever left his pre&s;ence, without an a&s;&s;urance of having what he &s;olicited; when at the &s;ame time his Grace &s;carcely knew what he had been a&s;ked for. A neighbour of his, a major in the
<PB N="235" REF="232">army, waited upon him on his re|turn from abroad, where he had the misfortune in an action to lo&s;e his leg: <Q>My dear major,</Q> &s;ays his Grace, running up to him and em|bracing him, <Q>I'm heartily glad to &s;ee you, I hope all things go well with you.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I can't &s;ay they do, my Lord Duke,</Q> returns he; <Q>I've had the misfortune to lo&s;e my .... ..,</Q>&mdash;<Q>Say no more, my dear major,</Q> retorts he quickly; and &s;topping his mouth with his hand, and conceiving it to be &s;ome appointment which he had lo&s;t, <Q>&s;ay no more, I intreat you, I'll give you a better.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Better, my Lord!</Q> returns the major, <Q>that cannot be.</Q>&mdash;<Q>How &s;o? my dear friend, how &s;o?</Q> replies the Duke&mdash;<Q>Becau&s;e,</Q> rejoins the ma|jor,
<Q><PB N="236" REF="233">I have lo&s;t my leg.</Q>&mdash;In the di&s;po&s;al of what I had to give, I never be&s;towed my favours where a large family and a &s;mall in|come had not made &s;ome friendly a&s;&s;i&s;|tance nece&s;&s;ary, and where the duties of the office did not, according to the be&s;t of my judgment, point out the propriety of the be&s;towal. Many a worthy heart did I gladden, many a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed object did I relieve, and many an oppre&s;&s;ed family did I rai&s;e from the du&s;t: &s;o that I might really &s;ay, in the language of the Patriarch, <Q>When the ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me, and when the eye &s;aw me, it gave witne&s;s to me, be|cau&s;e I delivered the poor, the widow and the fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him.</Q> And herein I will boa&s;t no merit;
<PB N="237" REF="234">I acted from a &s;elfi&s;h principle; for when I relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and made the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy, I &s;tudied my propen&s;ities, and gratified <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Was every great man to act as I did, he would be great indeed; they have &s;uch numberle&s;s opportunities of doing good, that were they to embrace but a few, they would not only render them&s;elves popular, but be the admiration and idol of the multitude.</P>
<P>Upon re&s;igning my office, I gave up my pen&s;ion, and being in the prime of life, have married a young lady of beauty of the fir&s;t rank and family; with a fortune not inferior to my own, and mind that does
<PB N="238" REF="235">honour to her &s;ex. Retired from public bu&s;ine&s;s, I am &s;et down quietly on my e&s;tate in the country, a favourite of fortune, and re&s;pected by my neighbourhood, where my friend the Vicar occa&s;ionally makes up part of my family, and we en|joy all the ble&s;&s;ings of dome&s;tic life.</P>

<P>IT having long been lamented, that in the pre&s;ent enlightened age, &s;o little encouragement &s;hould have been given to Literature, and that Authors &s;hould be obliged to accept a price for their works very inadequate to their worth, from an unwilling|ne&s;s, or inability, to ri&s;k the printing of them them|&s;elves; by which means, not only they, bu their families after them, have been deprived of the fruits of their labour. The REV. DR.
