<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">STREPHON and CHLOE.</NOTE> of Dr. SWIFT'S, (with all due Defe|rence to the Ladies, that Poem is menti|oned) gave the Author the fir&s;t Idea of a Comedy on this Subject. He had not thought &s;ufficiently of it, to form any regular Plan, when <HI>La Nouvelle Ecole de Femmes,</HI> of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Moi&s;&s;y,</HI> fell into his Hands. There were Circum&s;tances and Senti|ments in that Piece, which coincided with his De|&s;ign; and he al&s;o had &s;ome Objections. The Hu&s;|band's vi&s;iting a Lady of Fa&s;hion, under his own Name, and pa&s;&s;ing upon her for an unmarried Man; the <HI>Chevalier</HI>'s Attempt upon his Friend's Honour, without a proper Detection of either of them; the Wife &s;inging and dancing about the Stage thro' the whole La&s;t Act, in order to reclaim her Hu&s;band, and his Approbation of it; without any other <HI>Denouement,</HI> and without any Situations of Embara&s;&s;ment, which the Story &s;o naturally tended to, were, in his Opinion, palpable Deficien|cies. To &s;ub&s;titute other Materials, to form a La&s;t Act entirely new, and to work the whole into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedy, was the Employment of &s;ome vacant Hours in the la&s;t Summer. Whether he has been able to do it with any tolerable Spirit, either in the Dialogue, Characters, or Fable, he now &s;ubmits to the Deci&s;ion of the candid Rea|der. He acknowledges the public Candour, and he returns his Thanks to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> for his ad|mirable Acting; and to all the Performers con|cerned in the following Scenes; and al&s;o in THE DESERT ISLAND.</P>
