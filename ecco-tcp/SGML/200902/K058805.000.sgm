<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to premi&s;e, as an introduction to this work, that the fol|lowing pages were not made public with a de&s;ign of in&s;tructing men early bred to hu&s;bandry; but to give Gentlemen, who may think proper to u&s;e a certain quantity of land, either for amu&s;ement or con|venience, &s;uch an in&s;ight into the nature of farming, as will enable them to check the negligence, correct the ignorance, or detect the impo&s;ition, of &s;ervants.</P>
<P>There is not a more healthful, rational, or more plea&s;ing amu&s;ement in rural life than agriculture, nor does any one thing,
<PB REF="4">independent of profit from &s;ale, yield a fami|ly more conveniencies, or in greater plenty, than a farm: but it mu&s;t be a &s;atisfaction, at the &s;ame time, not to pay more for tho&s;e conveniencies than nece&s;&s;ary. To tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;eldom examine their ac|counts, or look into the application of their money, this treati&s;e will be u&s;ele&s;s: they take &s;ervants with good characters, and to their hone&s;ty they tru&s;t the whole. Few bailiffs, with a &s;tated &s;alary, are much in their ma&s;ter's intere&s;t; they crop the land, perhaps, and po&s;&s;ibly keep it in good condition; but the expence with which it is done, is no part of their con&s;ideration. A farmer's chief gains ari&s;e from making his land produce as much as po&s;&s;ible, and doing the bu&s;ine&s;s at as little expence as he can. For this purpo&s;e, he takes the ad|vantage of &s;ea&s;ons, attends to his team, that his hor&s;es are in health, kept &s;o with|out wa&s;te of provender, and that they work a certain number of hours; he takes care
<PB REF="5">to employ no hands but what are ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary; gives no more for labour than his neighbours; &s;ees that his labourers fill up their time, work their &s;tated hours, and neither rob him of nor wa&s;te his pro|perty; he gets his harve&s;t properly in, whil&s;t the weather is fine, buys in his &s;tock at the be&s;t hand, and gets a market price for all he &s;ells. But, does every gentle|man's bailiff do this? No. His ma&s;ter's eye is &s;eldom upon him; his account is &s;carce ever looked at; and he is found more in the intere&s;t of the employed than his em|ployer. I have &s;een twenty men in a hay|field, and about a hay-rick, when half the number would have been &s;ufficient; they have &s;tood in one another's way, and half their time they have been idle; in&s;tead of taking advantage of the dry time, and working till dark, they have quitted at &s;ix, and left the rick to the mercy of the weather. This a farmer <HI>never</HI> &s;uffers; and it is by this, and other things, that gentle|men
<PB REF="6">lo&s;e by farming. But, would they occa&s;ionally look into the bu&s;ine&s;s them|&s;elves (and none but &s;uch can ever expect to profit by it), they would very &s;oon find their account in it, and it would fill up many a li&s;tle&s;s hour.</P>
<P>To gentlemen fond of riding, without an object in view, even riding becomes irk|&s;ome; but were they, when in the country, to ride about their farm every fine day, each gate opening with a latch; were they to examine at &s;uch times the improvement of their cattle, the condition of their team and implements, the &s;tate of their fences, the cleanne&s;s of their grounds, the rich|ne&s;s of their meadows, and the luxuriance of their crops; new plea&s;ures would daily ri&s;e before them, and their morning's &s;aun|ter would be delightful. To &s;uch per&s;ons experiments occa&s;ionally made upon an acre or two of ground, under their own immediate direction, would throw new
<PB REF="7">lights upon hu&s;bandry, be u&s;eful to the world, and amu&s;ing to them&s;elves: but to make &s;uch experiments of real u&s;e, mi|nutes &s;hould be kept of every circum&s;tance re&s;pecting them; the nature of the &s;oil, the number of ploughings and harrowings, the quantity and kind of manure, the quantity of &s;eed &s;own, the time of &s;owing, the weather, the cultivation till harve&s;t, the time of cutting, the produce when thre&s;hed, and every other particular; and comparing the&s;e at home with former, or &s;imilar, crops, would afford no unplea&s;|ing amu&s;ement in a wet morning. But, whil&s;t I am &s;tudying the intere&s;t of others, I am forgetting my own. I am finding employment for <HI>gentlemen,</HI> who may <HI>dread</HI> employ, and under a notion of recom|mending my book, I am thus, perhaps, de&s;troying its &s;ucce&s;s. For <HI>any</HI> u&s;eful em|ploy to men of fortune, in the pre&s;ent age, is irk&s;ome to think of. They <HI>wa&s;te</HI> the
<PB REF="8">important hours, and <HI>fritter</HI> away their life in <HI>trifles.</HI></P>

<P>Since the following pages were written, the price of grain is con&s;iderably reduced: four years ago, wheat was &s;old at fourteen pounds a load; now it will &s;carce fetch eight. The prices, however, here &s;tated, are nearly the average.</P>

<HEAD><HI>TRUSLER</HI>'s Practical Hu&s;bandry.</HEAD>
<P>THERE being a general rage for Farming throughout the kingdom, among men of landed property, and among others who take it up under a principle of amu&s;ement, or gain, the Author of this work flatters him&s;elf, the following pages will be very acceptable to the Public; par|ticularly, as the many treati&s;es on farming hitherto publi&s;hed, are &s;o crowded with
<PB N="2" REF="12">theory, new experiments, and &s;pecula|tions, that, in&s;tead of being u&s;eful to coun|try gentlemen, they have ever mi&s;led them; and, after the trial of a number of years, have &s;hewn, that farming, to them, in|&s;tead of producing profit, has brought on a con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The fact in &s;hort is this: &s;uch books have induced gentlemen to try new methods, and follow them in all the round of idle &s;peculation, when they &s;hould have pur&s;ued that plain method which every farmer follows. Thus have they attri|buted their lo&s;s, to the di&s;hone&s;ty of &s;ervants, which, in fact, aro&s;e from their want of knowledge in the bu&s;ine&s;s of farming; whereas, had they never looked into &s;uch books of agriculture as are now extant, but depended even on the little knowledge and experience of an hone&s;t country &s;er|vant, bred to the plough, they would have reaped an advantage; though not equal perhaps to the farmer who has followed the bu&s;ine&s;s his whole life.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="13">To correct the&s;e mi&s;takes, and point out that method of agriculture which every experienced farmer pur&s;ues, is the de&s;ign of this Work; and the Author per&s;uades him&s;elf, that, if his in&s;tructions are ob|&s;erved and attended to, there is no land in this kingdom but will, while it amu&s;es the cultivator, yield him a con&s;iderable profit. He does not wi&s;h to deter gentle|men from trying experiments, or follow|ing new methods; but, if they wi&s;h to profit by farming, &s;uch experiments, or new methods, mu&s;t be made only occa&s;ion|ally. The lo&s;s of a few pounds on one acre of land is of no con&s;equence; but when that one is extended to &s;ome hun|dreds, it di&s;courages the enquirer, and leads him to attribute that to the di&s;hone&s;ty of &s;ervants, the poorne&s;s of the &s;oil, or bad markets, which is wholly owing to expe|rimental enquiry.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="4" REF="14">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF SOILS.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing every &s;y&s;tematic treati&s;e on agriculture teaches the hu&s;bandman to enquire into, is the nature of his &s;oil. Whether this con&s;i&s;ts of marle or lime&s;tone, more or le&s;s &s;alts or oil, the <HI>pabulum</HI> of plants, to the plain practical farmer, is immaterial; all that is e&s;&s;ential for him to know, is, whether the land be &s;tiff or light, and whether it is be&s;t adapt|ed to the growth of wheat or barley. Of this he may in&s;tantly judge by his eye, or he may learn it from a &s;ight of the crops, the information of the neighbours, or the trial of one year; and if even reduced to pick up his knowledge from the la&s;t, an indifferent crop for one year cannot ruin him.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="15">Every hu&s;bandman knows, that rye, bar|ley, turneps, and clover, will thrive be&s;t in a light &s;oil; oats, beans, and wheat, on a &s;tiff or &s;trong one: that &s;trong clayey land will require winter fallows to break and pulverize the &s;oil; and that light, &s;andy, or gravelly land will want &s;um|mer fallows to de&s;troy the weeds: that hor&s;e-dung is the be&s;t manure for all kinds of land, but that clayey land will receive benefit from light dre&s;&s;ing, though it be a&s;hes, or even &s;and; and that light lands may be helped even by a dre&s;|&s;ing of clay.</P>
<P>I would, however, advi&s;e every per&s;on commencing farmer, or taking a farm, to make &s;ome little enquiry into the nature of his land: as he will never jump into a farm ha&s;tily, without &s;ome con&s;ideration, I would recommend it to him to take a view of the crops ju&s;t before harve&s;t, the &s;ea&s;on before he is to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.
<PB N="6" REF="16">If the land be poor, the crops of wheat or oats will be thin, the &s;traw &s;hort, and the ears &s;mall; if rich, the crops, on the con|trary, will be thick, the &s;traw long, and the ears large, and in many places it will be lodged; that is, in&s;tead of the &s;traw &s;tanding upright, it will be fallen on the ground, a &s;ure &s;ign of the &s;trength and richne&s;s of the land. If the wheat be full of poppies, it denotes a light poor &s;oil; if full of thi&s;tles, a &s;trong good one. I men|tion this la&s;t ob&s;ervation, from what I have too often &s;een, that of a farm's being generally foul when a tenant quits it. In|deed a new occupier has little to expect, but to lo&s;e money for the fir&s;t three or four years, till he has cleared his land, and brought it into good heart; (&s;o apt are old tenants, through a mercenary principle, to over-crop it, and neglect to clean it, to|wards the expiration of their lea&s;e) unle&s;s he takes it immediately out of the hands of &s;ome gentleman, who has valued more the
<PB N="7" REF="17">neatne&s;s of his grounds, than any profit he might derive from them. By &s;uch a view of the different fields, he will be able to form a good judgment of the nature of the &s;oil, and what kind of crops it is be&s;t &s;uited to. If it &s;hould &s;o happen, that he cannot have this view of the farm the &s;ea&s;on before, he may collect the information from &s;uch neighbours as are no way intere&s;ted in his taking it; or let him take a &s;pade and examine the depth and nature of the mould, by digging in one or two of the furrows in each field. The greater depth of mould there is, the better the land, and the more capable of improvement. If the earth be a black crumbling mould, it cannot be bad. Foulne&s;s and poverty are to be got the bet|ter of, but it is very difficult and expen|&s;ive to increa&s;e the depth of the upper &s;taple of the land; that is, the earth in which the corn grows. With re&s;pect to the &s;trength and richne&s;s of the &s;oil, thi&s;tles among the weeds are no bad proof of it.
<PB N="8" REF="18">It &s;hould be the new comer's bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire what dre&s;&s;ing has been laid upon the different fields, and when, and what cour&s;e of crops they have borne; that is, what grain they have been &s;own with &s;ince the la&s;t fallow, and he &s;hould deter|mine his future crops accordingly. If he goes this way to work, and crops his land agreeable to the cour&s;es pointed out in this work, he will have no rea&s;on to apprehend much lo&s;s; particularly, if he has got a good hone&s;t carter, with &s;ome little experi|ence, who can plough and &s;ow the land well, and who will not rob his ma&s;ter him|&s;elf of the grain when thre&s;hed, nor &s;uffer the thre&s;hers to do it. Such a man may be ea&s;ily procured in every part of the king|dom; for countrymen, in general, accu&s;|tomed to hard and homely fare, and unac|quainted with the luxuries of life, have few temptations to di&s;hone&s;ty, and being void of art and cunning, if a little attend|ed to by their ma&s;ter, will not readily find
<PB N="9" REF="19">the way to injure him. Gentlemen, who, as I have before ob&s;erved, are obliged to entru&s;t more to their &s;ervants than farmers do, have been apt to attribute their lo&s;s in agriculture to them, which, in fact, has ari&s;en only from their trying experiments, pur&s;uing every fanciful &s;cheme laid down in books of hu&s;bandry, and expending more in the <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>neatne&s;s</HI> of their lands than is nece&s;&s;ary. If gentlemen wi&s;h to profit by farming, they mu&s;t content them&s;elves with tolerably clean fields, and good &s;aving crops; but if they &s;tudy to decorate their farms, by clipped hedges, large branching trees, that impoveri&s;h the headlands, &amp;c. belt walks, and the like, they mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer in the product. Lands will require a certain number of ploughings and harrowings, and a certain quantity of manure, and will well pay for &s;uch labour and expence; but if that cer|tain quantity is exceeded, the money is thrown away; for land may be made to
<PB N="10" REF="20">produce as good a crop with five or &s;ix ploughings as if ten were be&s;towed upon it; and as to dre&s;&s;ing, every farmer knows, it may be over done, for rank luxuriant wheat will be lodged with the fir&s;t rain or wind, and the crop then is irrecoverably lo&s;t. A cer|tain degree therefore of cleaning and ma|nuring is nece&s;&s;ary, and will be attended with advantage; but beyond that degree, the crop will not an&s;wer the tillage.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="11" REF="21">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. OF THE TEAM.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER principal matter that has mi&s;led many in their calculations of farming, is want of attention to the ex|pences of a team. Few gentlemen in commencing farmers begin with more than fifty or &s;ixty acres of land, what is called a &s;mall farm. Upon &s;uch a quantity of land, I defy any but a working farmer to be a gainer; he who works upon his farm him&s;elf, and &s;aves the expence of a &s;er|vant, and who occa&s;ionally goes with his hor&s;es to job-work, ploughs and harrows for other people who may now and then &s;tand in want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or employs his team on &s;pare days in carrying coals, timber, manure, &amp;c. for &s;uch as will hire him! for three or four hor&s;es will nearly
<PB N="12" REF="22">con&s;ume the whole produce of a farm of fifty acres, unle&s;s the land be very rich indeed.</P>
<P>Light &s;oils may be ploughed with two or three hor&s;es; but &s;tiff lands will re|quire four; a &s;ufficient quantity of land then mu&s;t be occupied to find full employ for &s;uch a team, in order to pay the farmer for his toils. This team will cultivate about one hundred and twenty acres of arable land; and as in mo&s;t farms there is &s;ome meadow, &s;ome upland gra&s;s, and &s;ome coppice, we may reckon a farm of one hundred and fifty acres of land not too much for a team of four hor&s;es, a man, and a boy. Other &s;ervants need only be hired occa&s;ionally. We will now con&s;ider the ex|pences of &s;uch a team. But let us fir&s;t e&s;timate the value of the nece&s;&s;ary farming imple|ments, that we may be able to rate their annual decline in value, as part of the ex|pences. I &s;hall not be very nice or exact in the&s;e e&s;timates, as the difference of a
<PB N="13" REF="23">pound or two in yearly expences is of little moment, and as very accurate calcu|lations would unu&s;efully &s;well the &s;ize of this tract; but I &s;hall &s;et them down from minutes I have taken, and e&s;timates I have made from &s;uch minutes, for my own curio&s;ity, for many years.</P>
<P>The price of labour, and the fir&s;t co&s;t of farming implements, will be found to vary a little in different counties, but not &s;o much as to make the difference of the aggregate &s;um of any con&s;equence. Our enquiries are not about &s;hillings, but &s;ums of greater moment.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary then for the culti|vation of a farm of one hundred and fifty acres, to have as follows:

<P>The above expences being as nece&s;&s;ary on a farm of &s;ixty acres, as upon one of
<PB N="17" REF="27">one hundred and fifty, it evidently appears, that no profits are to be gained upon &s;o &s;mall a farm; for after the rent, &s;eed, and har|ve&s;t are added to the amount, there mu&s;t remain a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, even &s;uppo&s;ing the land, on an average, to bring in four pounds an acre; which, con&s;idering acci|dents, and the nece&s;&s;ity of letting it lie idle for a fallow, once in five or &s;ix years, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to do: But let the &s;ame team do the work of a farm of one hundred and fifty acres (which, with management, it is capable of doing), and it will yield a con&s;iderable profit; as I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew. If gentlemen keep coach-hor&s;es, which they can occa|&s;ionally &s;pare to plough or harrow a few acres of ground, and cultivate no greater quantity of land than will maintain tho&s;e hor&s;es, and yield a product which they can con&s;ume in their own families; they will certainly find their account in occu|pying
<PB N="18" REF="28">even thirty or forty acres; as I have fully evinced in a Pamphlet I publi&s;hed &s;ome years ago, called <HI>The Way to be Rich and Re&s;pectable;</HI> where it will ap|pear, a per&s;on may live as well and make as good an appearance in the country for four hundred pounds a-year, as others do that &s;pend a thou&s;and pounds, having no &s;uch land: but tho&s;e who keep hor&s;es and &s;ervants, merely on the principle of farming, mu&s;t not expect to profit, un|le&s;s they occupy as much land as will employ tho&s;e &s;ervants and hor&s;es fully.</P>
<P>Some have recommended the u&s;e of oxen in&s;tead of hor&s;es, as eating no corn, and of cour&s;e le&s;s expen&s;ive; indeed, oxen do not decline in their value as hor&s;es do, being after four or five years labour generally fattened, and young ones broken in in their &s;tead; nor are they liable to &s;o many di&s;orders as hor&s;es: if an ox falls lame he is only fattened the &s;ooner, where|as
<PB N="19" REF="29">a lame hor&s;e is of little value. Again, al&s;o, there is &s;ome little &s;aving in harne&s;s, and attendance when their work is done; but, when it is con&s;idered that it will re|quire three, if not four, oxen to &s;upply the place of two hor&s;es, and of cour&s;e that a greater quantity of hay is con&s;umed, the object &s;aved is not &s;o great; e&s;pecially when &s;ome farmers contrive to &s;ave the decline in value of their hor&s;es, by doing their work with colts, and &s;elling them at five years old for coach hor&s;es. By this method their teams have turned out very profitably to them, the only nece&s;&s;a|ry care being, not to work them too hard. To effect this end, the team &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of mares, and a &s;tone-hor&s;e &s;hould be kept on the farm. With gentle work, a mare may be kept in harne&s;s till &s;he drops her foal, and worked again a few days after, with her foal by her &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="30">Being now on the &s;ubject of the team, I will take the opportunity of recom|mending iron axle-trees to waggons and carts, in&s;tead of wooden ones; the fir&s;t expence indeed will be more, each iron axle-tree co&s;ting about five pounds; where|as the price of a wooden one is not above &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ixpence: but I aver, it is cheape&s;t in the end, as they are not &s;o liable to break, and will la&s;t out two or three waggons; and add to this, the principal motive of my recommending them, a waggon with iron axles is of con|&s;iderably le&s;s draught than one with wooden axles. I am per&s;uaded it is the difference of one hor&s;e in four; that is, three hor&s;es will draw as much with iron axles, as four would with wooden ones: and the rea&s;on is evident. To make wooden axles &s;ufficiently &s;trong, their diameter mu&s;t be twice as large as iron ones; the friction, therefore, and of cour&s;e the draught, mu&s;t be proportionably greater.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF WHEAT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEAT being the farmer's &s;taple crop, to which he looks for his chief profit, he will pick out the cleane&s;t fields for this grain, and &s;uch as are mo&s;t in heart. The land is generally fallowed and manured for a wheat &s;ea&s;on, or the grain is &s;owed on the breaking up of a clover lay, which has lain a year or two in that artificial gra&s;s, or after a crop of turneps fed off with &s;heep, the land for which has been dre&s;&s;ed or manured the &s;pring before.</P>
<P>The time for &s;owing this grain, is from the beginning of September to the end of November; but the prime &s;ea&s;on, as ap|pears from a number of experiments made
<PB N="22" REF="32">by Mr. Young, is between the fir&s;t week in September and the la&s;t in October. Farmers, in general, wi&s;h to get their &s;eed into the ground by the 29th of September; they &s;eldom think of &s;owing earlier; in|deed, if they are to break up a clover lay, or &s;ow it on a turnep field, they cannot well get their land ready &s;ooner; as, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, they lo&s;e the clover feed in the month of September; and, in the other, the turneps are of little value much before Michaelmas. If, therefore, they have much wheat to &s;ow, and but one team to prepare the ground, nece&s;&s;ity of|ten obliges them to be &s;owing wheat in the month of November. If the land be wet, by po&s;tponing it &s;o long, they may chance to lo&s;e the &s;eed-time, from an im|po&s;&s;ibility of working the ground; but if the land be dry, the end of November will not be too late to produce a tolerable crop, though the nearer it is &s;owed to Michael|mas, the more we may expect to reap.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="33">Next, as to the quantity of &s;eed <HI>per</HI> acre: This is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, determined by the cleanne&s;s and richne&s;s of the land. If &s;own upon a fallow, or after turneps, two bu&s;hels an acre is the general allowance; if on a cloverday, rather more than two bu&s;hels, &mdash;about two bu&s;hels and a half. In a va|riety of experiments on clayey and gravel|ly &s;oils, Mr. Young a&s;&s;erts, that two bu&s;hels and a half is the mo&s;t advantageous quan|tity for an acre of land; but farmers in general &s;eldom &s;ow more than two bu&s;hels, or two bu&s;hels and one peck.</P>
<P>To prevent the wheat being black or &s;mutty, it is &s;eldom &s;own without being fir&s;t &s;teeped &s;ome hours in brine, made of water in which as much &s;alt has been di&s;|&s;olved as will cau&s;e an egg to &s;wim; when taken out, it is dried with powdered lime, and then &s;own. This cu&s;tom took its ri&s;e from an accident near the &s;ea-&s;ide, where a quantity of wheat was &s;owed, that by the
<PB N="24" REF="34">wreck of a ve&s;&s;el had been &s;ome time under water. It was ob&s;erved, that the year, in which this happened, was remarkable for &s;mutty corn, and the wheat in that neigh|bourhood particularly &s;o, whil&s;t the pro|duce of that grain that had been &s;oaked in &s;alt water was totally free from the lea&s;t appearance of &s;mut. Many farmers lime the &s;eed only, by pouring boiling water on lime, and when cold &s;oaking the &s;eed in it.</P>
<P>The &s;eed once &s;own, it requires little care till harve&s;t: all that is nece&s;&s;ary is, to keep it dry by water-furrowing, to weed it in the &s;pring, if foul (which &s;hould be done, if po&s;&s;ible, before the end of April, le&s;t it &s;hould be too much grown), and if its colour be a very dark green, and the crop &s;hould be too luxuriant, owing to the &s;trength and richne&s;s of the land, to turn a flock of &s;heep into it, in dry or fro&s;ty weather, in the month of March, and let them eat it down clo&s;e to the ground. If
<PB N="25" REF="35">this precaution be not taken, there will be danger of its falling, or being lodged by wind or rain before harve&s;t, and the crop in a great mea&s;ure &s;poiled. When eaten down by &s;heep, it will branch out afre&s;h, and the &s;tems will be &s;horter and le&s;s liable to fall.</P>
<P>Should the wheat in March or April bear a yellow hue, it is a &s;ign of its not being healthy; its colour &s;hould be a dark green. In wet land it will look yellow, but as the dry weather approaches it will regain its colour. In wet &s;oils, the nar|rower and higher the ridges or lands lie, the better; what ploughmen call two or three-bout lands are be&s;t; in this ca&s;e, there being a greater quantity of furrows, the water will, of cour&s;e, run off the readier, and the lands lie drier. In harrowing &s;uch lands after the corn is &s;own, the hor&s;es &s;hould go in the furrows; this will leave the ridges round and &s;mooth. In &s;owing
<PB N="26" REF="36">wheat, &s;ome plough it in, and others only harrow it in like other grain; the chief advantage of the fir&s;t way is, to pre&s;erve it from the birds. Wheat may be &s;own with advantage with, or after, the &s;econd ploughing.</P>
<P>If, in the month of February or March, the crop appears thin, weakly, or un|healthy, top dre&s;&s;ings of wood a&s;hes, malt|du&s;t, or &s;oot, may be occa&s;ionally &s;own over it, at the rate of about thirty or forty bu&s;hels an acre, which will greatly im|prove it; but this is an additional expence of twenty &s;hillings an acre, neither of the&s;e articles being the produce of the farm.</P>
<P>Change of &s;eed is another material ob|ject of attention, to which farmers pay a due regard, that their wheat may be large and heavy; nay, &s;ome kinds of grain will produce a greater quantity than others. The chief point with farmers in general
<PB N="27" REF="37">is, not to have &s;eed, if they can help it, from their own neighbourhood, but to procure &s;eed from light land to &s;ow on a &s;tiff &s;oil, and &s;eed from &s;tiff or &s;trong ground to &s;ow on light &s;oils; and great care &s;hould be taken, that the &s;eed &s;own be clean from the &s;eeds of weeds, otherwi&s;e you contribute to the foulne&s;s of your land.</P>
<P>In a word, though wheat is a grain that will not pay great expences in the culture, it &s;hould either be &s;own on land in good heart, or not at all. It is a crop that &s;hould ever &s;ucceed ameliorating ones, <HI>viz.</HI> beans, clover, tares, turneps, &amp;c. or a &s;ummer fallow, and thrives be&s;t on &s;tiff ground.</P>
<P>The following is an e&s;timate of a gene|ral &s;aving crop upon an acre of ground. As I &s;uppo&s;e the farm to con&s;i&s;t of one
<PB N="28" REF="38">hundred and fifty acres of land, and the aggregate expences of a team, with wear and tear of implements, &amp;c. to be as be|fore &s;tated 149 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> I &s;hall rate the team at twenty &s;hillings an acre. The account then will &s;tand thus:

<P><PB N="30" REF="40">Land may be brought into &s;uch heart as to produce four or five quarters of wheat an acre, at lea&s;t &s;uch land as that I am now &s;peaking of, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be worth fourteen or fifteen &s;hillings an acre. In this ca&s;e, every additional &s;ack of grain will produce an additional profit of eighteen &s;hillings and &s;ix pence. In the above e&s;timate, I have al&s;o rated the price of wheat very low; it is much oftener at a higher price than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Wheat will receive a greater advantage from dre&s;&s;ing, if the manure be not laid on immediately for it; that is, if the wheat crop follows an ameliorating crop of tur|neps, tares, &amp;c. for which the land had been previou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed; for, by this me|thod, the great &s;trength of the manure which makes the wheat rank, is taken off by a prior crop.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="41">Be&s;ides, dre&s;&s;ing and fallowing land for tares or turneps will produce a luxuriant crop, that will over&s;hadow the land &s;o much as to &s;mother any weeds carried on by the dre&s;&s;ing, and of cour&s;e the &s;ucceed|ing wheat-crop will be cleaner, as I &s;hall &s;hew in the chapter on Tares.</P>
<P>In looking over a field of wheat, if it be free from &s;mutty ears, the &s;traw pretty thick on the ground, and not lodged, the ears in general large, and the crop tolerably even; that is, the ears of corn throughout the field ri&s;ing every where from the ground to a level with each other, it may be pro|nounced a good crop.</P>
<P>Wheat is ripe and fit to reap when the &s;traw is every where yellow, and the ears hang down. If the wheat &s;heds in reap|ing, it &s;hould not be cut in the middle of the day, but mornings and evenings when
<PB N="32" REF="42">the dew is on; and that part of the field &s;hould be fir&s;t cut that was fir&s;t &s;own.</P>
<P>There are two or three &s;orts of wheat, but I do not know that one will produce a more profitable crop than another.</P>
<P>If, after wheat is reaped and bound, there &s;hould be much wet, the grain will be apt to &s;hoot, particularly in the bands. In this ca&s;e, it &s;hould be opened, dried, and rebound.</P>
<P>Between three and four hundred &s;heaves an acre, provided the ears be large and heavy, is a very good crop. Some acres will yield from &s;even to eight hundred &s;heaves; where there is &s;o much &s;traw, there is generally le&s;s corn. Some acres again, if the land be poor, will produce &s;carce two hundred &s;heaves.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="43">If fifteen &s;heaves produce a bu&s;hel of wheat, it is a very good crop. In this ca&s;e, an acre that gives three hundred &s;heaves will yield two quarters and a half, or half a load of wheat.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF BARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BARLEY thrives be&s;t on a dry light &s;oil, and requires three ploughings at lea&s;t, if not four, with a good deal of harrowing to bring the land into fine and proper tilth. The &s;tiffer the &s;oil, the more ploughings are nece&s;&s;ary. If the &s;pring be fine and dry, there is time to make the ground tolerably clean for this crop, which is &s;eldom &s;owed till about the beginning or middle of April. Barley is frequently &s;owed, and with &s;ucce&s;s, in the la&s;t week in April; but Mr. Young, from a variety of experiments which he made, a&s;&s;ures us, that provided the land be dry, and can be got into good tilth early enough (which may be, if barley follows
<PB N="35" REF="45">a &s;ummer fallow), the mo&s;t profitable time of &s;owing it, is the end of February or the beginning of March, as &s;uch early &s;owing will produce a third more at harve&s;t. This may be true, and worth the trial; but farmers, in general, &s;ow it late, that they may have an opportunity of be&s;towing much labour on their land, and making the &s;oil as fine as po&s;&s;ible. Be&s;ides, &s;uch late &s;owing often enables them to crop that land that was &s;own with turneps the year before for &s;heep-feed, and which can|not be eaten off, perhaps before the end of March.</P>
<P>The quantity of &s;eed u&s;ually &s;own, is four bu&s;hels <HI>per</HI> acre; and this is univer|&s;ally allowed, when clover is &s;own with it, to produce the be&s;t crop at harve&s;t. In|deed, when barley is &s;own without clover, five bu&s;hels of &s;eed will produce more grain at harve&s;t than four, but not in the proportion of five to four; &s;o that four
<PB N="36" REF="46">bu&s;hels of &s;eed <HI>per</HI> acre, is certainly the proper quantity to &s;ow with or without clover. As in the ca&s;e of wheat, the richer the land is, the le&s;s quantity of &s;eed is re|qui&s;ite, but that diminution of quantity is not great; perhaps a peck, or half a bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>Change of &s;eed is here as nece&s;&s;ary as in wheat crops. Care &s;hould be taken to &s;ow &s;uch as was rai&s;ed on a different &s;oil to that on which we mean to &s;ow it; and that the &s;eed be clean from the &s;eeds of weeds.</P>
<P>The general method of cultivating bar|ley is, to &s;ow the land with clover after the barley is in the ground, as will be &s;hewn when we &s;peak of clover; at pre|&s;ent, I will give the reader an e&s;timate of a tolerable, &s;aving crop of an acre of barley alone, but of &s;uch with which clover is mixed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. OF OATS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS grain, though not &s;o profitable as wheat or barley, from the great number of hor&s;es kept in this country, is a part of every farmer's crop. Indeed, though the produce is not of equal value with a crop of barley or wheat, there is more certainty in the price it will fetch at market; for I never yet ob&s;erved &s;o great a variation in the value of oats, as in that of the other two. If a farmer finds his land rich, and able to bear crops for years together, that will turn out more profitable than oats, he would be impru|dent to grow any. In this ca&s;e, it will be his intere&s;t to buy all the oats he wants, rather than grow them to a di&s;advantage;
<PB N="41" REF="51">but, if his &s;oil be a hungry one, and he cannot procure &s;ufficient manure, he will do right to have a crop of oats occa&s;ional|ly; for oats will grow almo&s;t in any land; though here, as in other crops, the richer the earth, the greater will be the produce. From four to five quarters of oats on an acre of ground, is a very good crop, where the land has been even dre&s;&s;ed; but, as farmers are apt to take three or four crops from their ground, after it has been fal|lowed and manured, before they &s;ow it with oats, they &s;eldom get more than three or four quarters an acre; whereas, were they to &s;ow the &s;eed on ground in good heart, the produce of an acre would be from &s;even to ten quarters.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal kinds of oats, &s;uch as are known by the names of, E&s;&s;ex, Poland, Scotch, and Black. The fir&s;t two are a large-bodied grain; the Scotch,
<PB N="42" REF="52">are &s;mall white oats, &s;uch as are given to hor&s;es; and the black are al&s;o good hor&s;e|corn, but of a black colour. The E&s;&s;ex and Poland thrive be&s;t in light barley land, the Scotch and black on &s;trong wheat land. The fairer, plumper, and &s;horter the body of the grain is, the better the quality; and to make it marketable, it &s;hould not be brown or mow-burnt, or have any mu&s;ty &s;mell. Such as is de&s;igned for &s;eed, &s;hould be well cleaned from the &s;eeds of any weeds.</P>
<P>Clover may be, and often is, &s;own with a crop of oats; but this is chiefly on &s;tiff land, where barley is never &s;own. In light barley land, farmers prefer the bar|ley crop to &s;ow their clover in, becau&s;e at that time the ground is cleaner, and in better heart. I &s;hall treat of an oat-crop here as &s;own by it&s;elf, without any mix|ture of clover, or other gra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="53">Farmers &s;eldom plough more than once for oats, tho' it would be better to turn the la&s;t year's &s;tubble in before Chri&s;tmas; and the cu&s;tomary time of &s;owing them is in the month of March, but a dry April is a better &s;eed-time than a wet March. Black oats will, generally &s;peak|ing, admit of being earlier &s;owed than white ones.</P>
<P>The quantity of &s;eed generally allowed for an acre of ground, is five bu&s;hels; though Mr. Young (who&s;e authority I have more than once quoted), from his ex|periments, a&s;&s;erts, that the mo&s;t advantage|ous quantity is from &s;even bu&s;hels to &s;even bu&s;hels and a half; but it appears from his enquiries, that the produce of &s;ix bu&s;hels does not exceed that of four bu&s;hels and a half, more than about one bu&s;hel and a half, which is ju&s;t the extra quantity of &s;eed; &s;o that his experiments prove no
<PB N="44" REF="54">more than that five bu&s;hels, the cu&s;tomary allotment of all farmers, is the mo&s;t ad|vantageous.</P>

<P>There is an additional expence in car|rying the crop of every field to market, which I have not mentioned before; nor was it perhaps nece&s;&s;ary now, it being in it&s;elf but trifling.</P>
<P>Plenty of &s;traw in a crop of oats, gene|rally denotes plenty of grain; but it is not always &s;o in other crops.</P>
<P>There is a critical time in cutting of oats; if they are cut too &s;oon, before they
<PB N="46" REF="56">are ripe, great part of the grain will not be thre&s;hed out; if they &s;tand till they are full ripe, they are very apt to &s;hed in cutting, turning, and getting in. He who would pre&s;erve his good crop, &s;hould, as they ripen, every day examine it; and, if he finds them ea&s;ily rub out as he handles them, &s;hould order them to be in&s;tantly cut. It &s;ometimes happens, that one part of a field &s;hall be riper than another; when this is the ca&s;e, the riper parts &s;hould be cut in the mornings and even|ings, when the dew is on them; the greener part, not &s;o liable to &s;hed, may be cut in the middle of the day. The &s;ame care &s;hould be taken in turning them, and raking them together after they are cut. If they are &s;tacked or hou&s;ed before the &s;traw is quite dry, they will be apt to heat in the mow, get a brown hue, and a mu&s;ty &s;mell, which will con&s;iderably reduce their value; and if they are full ripe, when cut and tumbled about in the
<PB N="47" REF="57">middle of the day, half the crop will be left &s;hed and &s;cattered in the field.</P>
<P>Should the &s;traw of a crop of oats be &s;o luxuriant as to fall or lodge, it will receive le&s;s damage then a crop of any other grain. We need not be apprehen&s;ive, therefore, of its being too rank.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. OF BUCK-WHEAT.</HEAD>
<P>BUCK wheat, or French wheat, is a &s;pring crop, and frequently, like tares and turneps, &s;own merely as a manure, to plow into the ground, in order to prepare it for wheat. It is a grain not commonly brought to market, yet, neverthele&s;s, of importance to the farmer, as it will thrive in lands not in a proper condition for bar|ley, and will pay him well for &s;owing it in rich &s;oils; though the general opinion is, that it flouri&s;hes be&s;t on poor lands. But what is mo&s;t worthy of con&s;ideration in this crop is, that it need not be &s;own till the middle of May, a circum&s;tance very advantageous to &s;uch as occupy wet lands. So that if the ground be not in very good
<PB N="49" REF="59">heart, or it &s;hould turn out a bad &s;ea&s;on for barley &s;owing, it is not an unplea&s;ant thing to be able to reap from it a good crop of buck-wheat. Where barley is given to cattle, buck-wheat will an&s;wer the end as well; and the &s;traw, if pro|perly got in, will turn out good winter fodder. Wet &s;ummers are not &s;o favour|able for it as dry ones.</P>
<P>The time to &s;ow this grain is, as I &s;aid before, about the middle of May, and the mo&s;t advantageous quantity of &s;eed <HI>per</HI> acre, one bu&s;hel. If the land, by fre|quent ploughings and harrowings, be made tolerably fine, and the &s;ea&s;on be favour|able, there is little doubt of having a good crop.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. OF BEANS.</HEAD>
<P>BEANS thrive be&s;t in a &s;trong &s;tiff &s;oil; and few farmers &s;ow them but in &s;uch ground. There are &s;everal &s;orts of beans, though &s;eldom more than two are the ob|jects of the hu&s;bandman's attention; the&s;e are hor&s;e-beans for the food of hor&s;es, and tick-beans for the food of hogs. I have &s;een &s;ome fields of long-pods, which is a garden bean; and I have my&s;elf &s;owed an acre or two, more than once, with broad Wind&s;ors, and dwarf kidney beans; but as the&s;e are out of the line of farming, I &s;hall not &s;ay more about them.</P>
<P>Of the two &s;orts u&s;ually cultivated at large, hor&s;e-beans require a &s;tronger ground
<PB N="53" REF="63">than tick-beans. There are two me|thods of &s;owing them; &s;ome &s;ow them broadca&s;t on the ground, and plough them in, in one earth flat; or plough the ground fir&s;t into ridges, then &s;ow them broadca&s;t, and harrow them in; and others &s;et them, bean by bean, in a line with dibbers. I have tried them both ways, and &s;carce know which to give the prefer|ence to. If they are &s;own upon a clover lay, they certainly &s;hould be &s;et, that is, pricked in, bean by bean; for as &s;eldom more than one ploughing is given to a crop of beans, the earth of a clover field, when broke up, is not fine enough, that is, not &s;ufficiently pulverized, to admit of their being &s;owed broadca&s;t, like other grain; but if they follow a crop of turneps, wheat, or oats, broadca&s;t fowing will do very well.</P>
<P>In &s;owing beans broadca&s;t, the expence of &s;etting them (which is done by women
<PB N="54" REF="64">and children) is avoided, and al&s;o a fur|ther di&s;advantage; for though the di&s;tance from row to row is pointed out to them, they are apt to &s;et them too thick in the rows, being paid in proportion to the quan|tity they &s;et, &s;even-pence or eight-pence a peck, which they get rid of as fa&s;t as they can; nor, watch them and talk to them as you will, can you prevent their doing it: this not only wa&s;tes the &s;eed, but too often injures the crop. But then again, on the other hand, when &s;owed broadca&s;t, every part of the field may not be equally co|vered, the land does not look &s;o neat, and there being a greater difficulty in hoeing them, the men are u&s;ually paid &s;ix|pence or nine-pence an acre extraordina|ry. The quantity of beans &s;own and &s;et is nearly the &s;ame in both ways. About two bu&s;hels and a peck, or two bu&s;hels and a half <HI>per</HI> acre. The crop at harve&s;t is rather in favour of &s;etting than other|wi&s;e,
<PB N="55" REF="65">but perhaps not &s;ufficient to pay the extra expence.</P>
<P>If drilling of crops be worth the atten|tion of the farmer, it is more &s;o in beans and peas than in any other grain; but even here, &s;etting them is a very good &s;ub&s;titute; and con&s;idering the expence of a drill-plough, which not one wheeler in twenty knows how to make or repair, and not one ploughman in a hundred knows how to u&s;e, I que&s;tion whether &s;etting is not equally cheap in the end. I am &s;ure it is le&s;s trouble&s;ome to the farmer. Be&s;ides, on &s;tiff clayey &s;oils, where beans be&s;t thrive, it is impo&s;&s;ible to u&s;e a drill-plough, which is adapted only to loo&s;e light lands.</P>
<P>The end of February, or early in March, is the cu&s;tomary &s;eed-time for beans, though many &s;ow them &s;o late as April;
<PB N="56" REF="66">and &s;ome, I have heard &s;ay, put them in at or before Chri&s;tmas. From Mr. Young's Experiments, it appears, that early in Fe|bruary is the mo&s;t advantageous time; but accidents will occa&s;ionally delay the &s;owing &s;ometimes a week or a fortnight, &s;uch as wet weather, particularly where they are &s;et by women, and there is a want of hands to &s;et them.</P>
<P>The great advantage of a crop of beans to the land ari&s;es from the hoeing, as &s;uch a crop mu&s;t be always hand-hoed with a &s;ix-inch hoe, once, if not twice, during its growth. If the land be tole|rably clean, and the hoeing can be deferred till the beginning of May, once may be &s;uf|ficient: but if after the fir&s;t hoeing, the weeds &s;till get a-head, and are likely to ri&s;e as high as the beans, they mu&s;t be hoed a &s;econd time. If the land be in good heart, and the beans grow away
<PB N="57" REF="67">&s;trong after once hoeing, they will get above the weeds, and by their luxuriance keep them down, and &s;mother them. As beans have a tap root, and draw their nu|triment chiefly from the lower &s;taple of the ground; and as they are hoed once or twice during their growth, and of cour&s;e the weeds de&s;troyed; farmers con&s;ider a bean crop almo&s;t as good as a &s;ummer fal|low, and will often &s;ow wheat immediate|ly following; though I do not hold this to be good farming, unle&s;s the land had been manured for the beans. A ma&s;ter will be better able to judge whether they be clean hoed, provided they are &s;et in rows, than in the broad-ca&s;t method of &s;owing; and in a broad-ca&s;t crop, it is as nece&s;&s;ary to cut out beans with the hoe, where they ri&s;e too thick, &s;etting them out at di&s;tances in the manner of turneps, as it is to cut up the weeds. To know whether this be properly done, we mu&s;t walk over every land.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="68">To judge whether a field of beans be good or bad, we mu&s;t examine how they are kidded; for a good crop depends more on this, than on the quantity of haulm. If they are kidded all the way up from the bottom to the top, and the kids in general contain five or &s;ix beans, we may expect to reap largely; but, if otherwi&s;e, the re|ver&s;e. A dry &s;ummer is not &s;o good for beans as a &s;howery one; for, in very dry weather, the &s;talks are &s;hort and &s;lender, and the crop often blighted; that is, co|vered with a black fly: in this ca&s;e, they mu&s;t take their chance, for rain only can recover them.</P>
<P>They are &s;eldom ripe enough to cut till September; but the proper time may ea&s;ily be known by examining them. When the kids are black, and begin to open at the end, they ought to be cut; and though throughout the field &s;ome of the kids be not &s;o black as others, this &s;hould not pre|vent
<PB N="59" REF="69">us; for they will ripen and harden after they are cut, by &s;etting the &s;heaves upright, and leaving them out in the field for a week or ten days. If they are cut before they are ripe, they will &s;hrivel; and if too ripe, they will &s;hed con&s;iderably in the cutting. Should this la&s;t be the ca&s;e, they &s;hould not be cut in the middle of the day, but in the mornings and evenings only, when the dew is on them. They &s;hould not be pulled up by the roots, for you would thus carry a quantity of dirt into your thre&s;hing floor, but cut off with a hook as they reap wheat.</P>
<P>An acre of land proper for beans, will produce, with good culture, from two quarters and a half (that is, half a load) to five and &s;ix quarters; but three quarters and a half, or four quarters, may be rec|koned a very good crop. Rather a greater quantity of tick-beans may be got from an acre of ground than hor&s;e-beans; but hor&s;e|beans
<PB N="60" REF="70">bear always a better price, &s;o that the value of each crop will be much the &s;ame. In purcha&s;ing beans, particularly for &s;eed, care &s;hould be taken that they are hard, and not &s;hrivelled; and the &s;maller the bean the better, as there are a greater quantity in the &s;ame mea&s;ure. Beans will generally fetch a greater price after they have lain in the &s;tack eight or nine months, than if they are thre&s;hed out before Chri&s;t|mas, as they are then harder and better for feed.</P>

<P>Where manure is laid on for any crop, it will add &s;omething to the expence; as an additional hand or two mu&s;t be employ|ed to fill the cart, and &s;pread the dung. The price of &s;preading is generally one &s;hilling <HI>per</HI> acre, and one &s;hilling or eighteen pence an acre may be reckoned for labour in filling.</P>
<P>Mr. Young tells us, that, from the ex|periments he made, he finds, that by &s;ow|ing beans upon the &s;ame land, year after
<PB N="63" REF="73">year, each &s;ucceeding year will produce a better crop than the year before, even though no dre&s;&s;ing be put upon the land; that where the fir&s;t year produced only three quarters and a half, the third year produced five quarters. This he attributes to hoeing and de&s;troying the weeds, which was done three or four times in each year, and the tops of the beans being cut off, ju&s;t as they were going to blo&s;&s;om. It may be worth the trial on &s;mall &s;pots of ground, but is a thing never done by farmers.</P>
<P>I hold trench-ploughing to be good in the culture of beans, where the depth of mould will admit of it, as it gives the plant room to &s;trike deeper than in the ordinary method of ploughing, but I am no advocate for turning up the gravel or clay among the mould.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. OF PEAS.</HEAD>
<P>PEAS generally flouri&s;h mo&s;t in light, dry, &s;ound land, but tolerably good crops may be procured on cold, brick earth, loams, or clays.</P>
<P>There are various &s;orts of peas, but tho&s;e u&s;ually &s;own by farmers, are white peas and hog peas; the fir&s;t is well known, but of hog peas, there are al&s;o two or three &s;orts, grey, dun, blue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There being other crops that pay better than peas, farmers generally &s;ow them on poor land, &s;uch as is grown foul, and per|haps out of heart; but, like every other crop, I am per&s;uaded, they would pay for a certain degree of cultivation; but over|dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="65" REF="75">would make the haulm grow large and rank, and the crop will &s;uffer by it. Wet &s;ea&s;ons are always prejudicial to peas: for the above rea&s;ons, peas are not always a part of the farmer's crop.</P>
<P>In light land, drilling them may be a good method, as, in that ca&s;e, if nece&s;&s;ary, they can be better hoed, and a future crop al&s;o will receive a benefit from &s;uch hoe|ing; but in &s;trong &s;tiff lands, they mu&s;t be &s;own broad-ca&s;t. Indeed, &s;owing broad|ca&s;t will, all things con&s;idered, produce a greater quantity at harve&s;t than drilling; and, as it is attended with le&s;s trouble and expence upon the whole, perhaps it may be as well, if not better.</P>
<P>The quantity &s;own on an acre of ground of the white peas, is generally three bu&s;hels; but Mr. Young, from his experi|ments, finds, that four bu&s;hels and a half of
<PB N="66" REF="76">white peas, and five bu&s;hels and a half of hog peas, are a more proper quantity; for, in wet &s;ea&s;ons, if a quantity of &s;eed &s;ufficient to &s;tock the land be not &s;own, a proportion of weeds will occupy their place; and where farmers do not hoe their pea&s;e, a thick crop is nece&s;&s;ary to cover the ground and &s;mother the weeds.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary time of &s;owing, is about the middle of March, and that of cutting, in Augu&s;t. When they begin to ripen, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tation a boy in the field to frighten away pigeons, and other birds, otherwi&s;e they will carry away half the crop. The &s;ame attention mu&s;t be paid to the time and manner of cutting, as was pointed out in the ca&s;e of beans. A good &s;ample of peas, is when they are not &s;hrivelled, but look large, plump, and fair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. OF TARES.</HEAD>
<P>TARES are cultivated for three or four purpo&s;es. Some &s;ow them for the &s;eed; others to cut green for hor&s;es and other cattle; &s;ome make the haulm into hay, for winter feed, and others feed it off with &s;heep and lambs in the &s;pring. In which|ever way, however, the crop is con&s;umed, though it &s;eldom forms part of a farmer's regular cour&s;e of crops, it is, neverthe|le&s;s, far from being an unprofitable one.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts, winter tares and &s;pring tares; the fir&s;t are a hardy kind, and generally &s;own before or about Michaelmas, to cut green for hor&s;es in the &s;pring, or &s;tand for &s;eed.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="80">If they are &s;owed in the month of Augu&s;t, and de&s;igned for &s;eed, they will be fit to cut early in the month of Augu&s;t following, after which there will be &s;uffici|ent time to prepare the land for wheat: or when the tares are carried off the ground, it may be ploughed up, and &s;own with turneps, by which means two crops are produced from the &s;ame ground in one year.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t farming is to &s;ow them at Michaelmas, or not later than the &s;econd week in October, about two bu&s;hels, or rather better, to an acre, and that upon land that has been fallowed and dre&s;&s;ed: from &s;uch fallow and dre&s;&s;ing, may be ex|pected a very luxuriant crop, that will ri&s;e above, and &s;mother every weed that might either be carried upon the ground in the dre&s;&s;ing, or not be de&s;troyed by the fallow. This crop &s;hould be cut for hay in the be|ginning of June; when, after two plough|ings,
<PB N="71" REF="81">the land may be &s;own with turneps, and being eaten off by &s;heep at Michael|mas, the ground is in the be&s;t order that can be for a crop of wheat, as it will then be perfectly clean, and in good heart; for the dre&s;&s;ing the &s;heep leave will amply compen&s;ate for the crop of tares, which not being &s;uffered to &s;tand for &s;eed, will not draw the ground, but leave it in the fine&s;t order. Thus, al&s;o, two crops will be gained in one year, without injuring the land.</P>
<P>Whether &s;pring tares are &s;own for hay, or for &s;eed, the quantity of &s;eed, and time of &s;owing, are the &s;ame. As one great advantage in cultivating this pul&s;e, is bringing the ground into fine order for wheat or barley; it would be well if the land were dre&s;&s;ed for it, and care taken to &s;ow it early, that there may be a thick crop, &s;ufficient to cover the ground and &s;mother the weeds. March is the proper time for &s;owing, and
<PB N="72" REF="82">the quantity two bu&s;hels and a half <HI>per</HI> acre. Once or twice ploughing will do for tares, which &s;hould be rolled after they are well harrowed in. They require no further trouble till harve&s;t, except cutting out the thi&s;tles, if any &s;hould ri&s;e, for every other weed a thick crop of tares will de&s;troy; and &s;uch is the advantage of a thick crop, that if cut for hay, they ad|mirably prepare the ground for a crop of wheat, breeding that putrid fermentation in the &s;oil, which renders it as fertile and as mellow, as after the be&s;t fallow.</P>
<P>If tares are de&s;igned for hay, the time of cutting them is when they are in full blo&s;&s;om. If they are left longer, they draw the land too much, and make not &s;uch good hay as when they are in the highe&s;t &s;tate of &s;ucculency. Though &s;ome contend, that the hay will prove heartier food, if they &s;tand to pod, and the pods to fill; that in this ca&s;e, hor&s;es eating &s;uch hay,
<PB N="73" REF="83">will require le&s;s corn. This I believe to be the ca&s;e, but I am a &s;trong advocate for keeping the ground in good condition. If the crop be got in without rain, tare|hay is better than any common hay, but rain injures it a great deal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. OF TURNEPS.</HEAD>
<P>TURNEPS, like tares, is one of tho&s;e ameliorating crops, who&s;e cul|ture cleans the land, and, at the &s;ame time, enriches it. They thrive be&s;t in light &s;oils, but &s;ucceed tolerably well on &s;tiff ones. Very &s;trong clays are the only &s;oils in which they will not grow to ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Farmers con&s;ider a crop of turneps as a &s;ummer fallow, and as the be&s;t preparative for either wheat or barley. To obtain a good field of turneps, they plow the land four or five times, harrow it till it is as fine as they can make it, and then dre&s;s it. All this is done with the &s;ame view that I recommended tares, viz. to procure a
<PB N="78" REF="88">luxuriant crop, that will &s;mother the weeds which the dung carries into the field with it, in order that the &s;ucceeding crop, whether of wheat or barley, may be clean and plentiful. Be&s;ides, as this crop is fed off by &s;heep, the better it is, the longer will it maintain a given number of &s;heep, and of cour&s;e the greater quantity of dre&s;&s;ing &s;uch &s;heep leave behind them. It is generally a lo&s;ing crop for that year, but the advantage hereafter reaped amply repays the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper time to &s;ow them, is about mid&s;ummer, or &s;oon after, &s;o that, if the &s;pring be fine, there is &s;ufficient time to clean the ground. Though we wait a week or two for it, a dripping time is be&s;t for &s;owing, for without &s;ome rain the &s;eed may not grow; in very dry &s;ea|&s;ons, as &s;oon as they are out of the ground, the fly is apt to de&s;troy them; and when this is the ca&s;e, we have no other re&s;ource
<PB N="79" REF="89">than to harrow the land, and &s;ow it afre&s;h. If they e&s;cape the fly, as &s;oon as they put forth the rough leaf, they &s;hould be hand|hoed with a nine-inch hoe, cutting them up where they are too thick, and leaving them at about nine inches di&s;tance from each other. About a month after, they &s;hould be hoed a &s;econd time, to de&s;troy the weeds: by this time, they will be of &s;ufficient growth to keep the weeds down and &s;mother them. They require no other care till they are either drawn for cattle, or eaten off by &s;heep. One pound of &s;eed <HI>per</HI> acre, is the quantity u&s;ually &s;own; and as there are two or three &s;orts of tur|neps, &s;ome prefer the green-round, and others the tap-rooted, as growing to a larger &s;ize. In a tolerable good crop, the average weight of an acre of turneps, is about thirty or thirty-two tons. They rather improve in weight from December to January, but decline in weight from
<PB N="80" REF="90">January to March. In my neighbourhood, where farmers have not a &s;ufficient &s;tock of &s;heep of their own, they &s;ell their tur|neps to tho&s;e who have; and the price of an acre varies in proportion to the quan|tity of feed there is, from twenty-five &s;hillings to forty &s;hillings; and they never think of di&s;po&s;ing of their crop any other way. Tho&s;e who draw them to fatten cattle, may po&s;&s;ibly turn them to greater advantage; Mr. Young &s;ays double; but, as every farmer has not money to buy &s;tock to fatten, he is obliged to give up that thought, and content him&s;elf with enriching his land, by folding of &s;heep upon it. For ten acres of turneps would require a &s;tock of one hundred and twen|ty-four pounds in cattle to con&s;ume them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. OF CLOVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE introduction of clover has turn|ed out a great trea&s;ure to the far|mer, it being one of tho&s;e crops that pays well for the tillage; and, at the &s;ame time, enriches and ameliorates the land. Its profits are reaped three ways, being either fed, cut for hay, or &s;uffered to &s;tand for &s;eed. If the farmer has &s;ufficient &s;tock to eat his clover green, or has money to purcha&s;e &s;uch a &s;tock, he will reap a double advantage by &s;o doing; for an acre of clover fed off green, will maintain a given number of cattle much longer than it would, if made into hay. Be&s;ides, as in this ca&s;e it does not &s;tand to flower, it draws the ground le&s;s, and the dre&s;&s;ing left by the cattle is no incon&s;iderable ad|vantage.
<PB N="84" REF="94">If cattle are turned in in the be|ginning of June, three acres of clover (&s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e three acres, if cut and made into hay, to produce four loads and a half cut out of the rick) will fatten and maintain nine hor&s;es and four cows for four weeks; which, at four &s;hillings a hor&s;e, and two &s;hillings and &s;ix pence a cow, <HI>per</HI> week, amounts to nine pounds four &s;hillings. Now, in this time, they would eat &s;ix loads of hay, worth twelve pounds; or, were the&s;e three acres cut and made in|to hay, reckoning the hay at forty &s;hillings a load (and it is always five &s;hillings le&s;s in value than a load of meadow hay), and deducting ten &s;hillings an acre for mowing, making, &s;tacking, thatching, and binding, it leaves a profit only of &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings; and &s;hould a purcha&s;er require it to be carried ten miles, &s;uch carriage would be two pounds five &s;hillings, and re|duce the profit to five pounds five &s;hillings. But was &s;uch a fir&s;t crop of clover (for I
<PB N="85" REF="95">am now only &s;peaking of the fir&s;t cutting, I &s;ay, was &s;uch a fir&s;t crop) cut day by day, carried into the &s;table, or farm-yard, and given to hor&s;es or cows there, it would turn out &s;till more advantageous, for it would maintain twenty hor&s;es for four weeks (I &s;peak this from experience); which twenty hor&s;es, in the &s;ame time, would con&s;ume eleven loads of clover hay, worth twenty-two pounds. Here, indeed, the dre&s;&s;ing is not laid upon the land; but the hor&s;es would in that month, if littered down with about &s;even loads of &s;traw, yield forty loads of dung, which would dre&s;s four acres of land well; a circum|&s;tance that would amply pay for cutting and carting home, and carrying the dung out again upon the land. Be&s;ides, a team &s;o kept upon green meat, would require very little corn; half the quantity would do, an object of importance to the farmer.</P>

<P>Here al&s;o the land is not exhau&s;ted, but exceedingly well dre&s;&s;ed. I have
<PB N="89" REF="99">reckoned nothing for labour in cutting, as the carter and boy will do it; nor have I brought &s;traw into the account, as the farm will produce &s;ufficient litter, that could not be &s;old, bean-haulm, fern, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor have I here e&s;timated the &s;aving in the corn given to the hor&s;es, which is con&s;iderable; nor either rent or team, the&s;e being equal in every ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am upon the article of clover, and mentioning the feed of it for cows, I mu&s;t not omit the danger of turning them in, while it is young and high. Cows are internally differently formed from hor&s;es; a cow has not only a &s;tomach, but a paunch, de&s;igned by nature as a receptacle for her food. Here &s;he depo&s;its it for a while without ma&s;tication; and when &s;he has eaten &s;ufficient, &s;he, at her lei&s;ure, brings it a &s;econd time into her mouth, chews it, and conveys it into her &s;tomach, where it is dige&s;ted and carried off. Clover
<PB N="90" REF="100">is a very loo&s;e vegetable, full of air, par|ticularly when young, and in &s;howery weather; and as the paunch has not the &s;ame dige&s;tive power with the &s;tomach, checking that fermentation that lets loo&s;e the air; if &s;he eats heartily of young clo|ver, and fills her paunch by drinking &s;oon after; when fermentation takes place, and the air is let loo&s;e, &s;he will &s;well prodigi|ou&s;ly; and from &s;uch &s;welling, the vital &s;y&s;tem will be impeded, the circulation of the blood &s;topped, and the animal will die in fifteen minutes. If &s;he has not filled her&s;elf too full, driving her and hurrying her about, will often relieve her; but &s;hould &s;he have overloaded her paunch, and drank upon it, there is no remedy but one, which, though &s;evere, is generally &s;afe and effec|tual (having had occa&s;ion to try it, I &s;peak from experimental knowledge); it is, that of making an inci&s;ion with a pen|knife through the flank into the body of the paunch, and introducing the pipe of a
<PB N="91" REF="101">funnel into the orifice, thus letting out that air, that otherwi&s;e would de&s;troy the ani|mal. By keeping the hole open, till the complaint cea&s;es, we remove the dan|ger; and by piercing the hide with an awl, &s;owing up the wound, and the ap|plication of a pla&s;ter, it will &s;oon heal. The place to make the inci&s;ion is in the fle&s;hy part of the left &s;ide or flank, at an equal di&s;tance from the &s;hort ribs, the &s;pine of the back, and the hip-bone; it &s;hould be pierced till the air i&s;&s;ues out freely. Sheep are formed like cows; of cour&s;e the &s;ame caution &s;hould be taken with them. But let the bulk of the gra&s;s be fir&s;t eaten down by hor&s;es, and there is no danger; or, it is &s;aid, if they are not turned in while the dew is on the gra&s;s, it may be done with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Clover is a fine thriving food for hogs; where there is a pond in the field, which they can always have recour&s;e to, I do
<PB N="92" REF="102">not know any better way of di&s;po&s;ing of the crop. But water is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that without it, it is in vain to think of it. Any part of a field may be hurdled off with gate-hurdles; and the only trouble is, tak|ing good care that they do not break out. Some are apt to think hog-dung prejudi|cial; but it is an erroneous notion. Being very full of &s;alts, where the land is richly dre&s;&s;ed with it, the fir&s;t crop may be rank, but future crops will feel its effects for years. I am of opinion, that there cannot be more profitable hu&s;bandry, than by purcha&s;ing &s;ows forward with pig, turning them into clover, &s;uffering them to pig there, and continue with their pigs till they are three or four months old, and then &s;elling them for &s;tore. An acquaint|ance of mine told me, that having once five acres of clover, a good crop, with a pond in the field, and well fenced in; he purcha&s;ed in May ten &s;ows of the large breed, ready to pig, which co&s;t him thirty
<PB N="93" REF="103">pounds; that he turned them into this field about the middle of the month, kept them there till the middle of September, and then &s;old them; that the ten &s;ows brought him ninety-eight pigs, which he &s;old for fifteen &s;hillings each, and the &s;ows for two pounds ten &s;hillings each; that they fold|ed the land like a flock of &s;heep, and &s;o richly manured it, that it wanted no dre&s;&s;|ing for near twenty years. After the clover, he &s;owed it with wheat, which was &s;o rank, as to fall, and turn out of no value; but the year following, he &s;owed it with wheat again, and had a prodigious crop.</P>

be&s;ides enriching the ground.</P>
<P>Clover, in general, thrives be&s;t on light barley land. It is u&s;ually &s;own with the &s;econd crop after a fallow, with either barley or oats, but &s;ometimes with wheat; and the richer the land, the better the crop. After the barley or oats are &s;own and harrowed in, they cu&s;tomarily &s;ow the clover, &s;ometimes by it&s;elf, particularly if it be de&s;igned for &s;eed, and &s;ometimes mixed with artificial gra&s;&s;es for hay. When &s;own, it &s;hould be rolled. If clover is &s;own with a wheat crop, it &s;hould be put
<PB N="97" REF="107">into the ground in the month of March, before the wheat is too high. This is done by harrowing the ground, &s;owing, and rolling it. The harrows will not da|mage the wheat. But wheat is a crop that does not afford it &s;ufficient &s;helter; of cour&s;e it is bad hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>All things con&s;idered, it is much more advantageous to &s;ow clover with a fir&s;t crop after a turnep &s;ea&s;on, or a fallow, than with the &s;econd, as is commonly done; for, the land being then clean, and in good heart, the crop will be con&s;ider|ably greater, and the clover will &s;tand a &s;econd year very well; e&s;pecially if, in &s;uch &s;econd year, a&s;hes, or a light dre&s;&s;ing of dung, be be&s;towed on it. Indeed clover is one of tho&s;e crops, which will pay for very ample manuring; but is, at the &s;ame time, liable to be injured by unfavourable weather; a dry &s;eed-time, or a wet har|ve&s;t. In dry &s;ummers, though the crop
<PB N="98" REF="108">be &s;mall, it will weigh heavy, and cattle will thrive on it better than when the crop is larger, it being &s;weeter and fuller of nu|triment.</P>
<P>The quantity of &s;eed &s;own on an acre of ground, is generally from nine pounds to fourteen; the average quantity ten pounds. But, Mr. Young a&s;&s;erts, from a variety of experiments that he made, that in poor land twenty pounds, and in clean rich land, fifteen pounds an acre, is the mo&s;t advantageous quantity; as in rich land the roots will &s;pread more, and leave le&s;s room for weeds, or natural gra&s;s.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of clover, <HI>viz.</HI> broad clover, which bears a red flower; the white Dutch, which bears a white flower; and the trefoil, which bears a yel|low one. The fir&s;t is what farmers ge|nerally &s;ow, as growing higher, and pro|ducing a larger crop. The white Dutch,
<PB N="99" REF="109">and trefoil, are better for laying down lawns and meadows, as they will matt and grow thicker at bottom; but they are not profitable to cut for hay. There is al&s;o another &s;pecies of clover, called cow-gra&s;s, from its being le&s;s liable to &s;pring cows that feed on it. This la&s;t, though &s;own in March, makes but little appearance till Mid|&s;ummer, and can be cut but once; but yet grows to a great height, and produces in general large crops.</P>
<P>The profits of a crop of clover, as I &s;aid before; are reaped three ways; by feeding it with cattle, cutting it for hay, or &s;uffering it to &s;tand for feed. I have al|ready pointed out the profits ari&s;ing from feeding; let us next &s;ee what it will pro|duce when cut for hay; and in this e&s;ti|mate, I will &s;uppo&s;e an equally good crop with that I con&s;idered before as fed, <HI>viz.</HI> to produce two loads and a quarter <HI>per</HI> acre at the two cuttings; I mean two loads and a
<PB N="100" REF="110">quarter out of the rick; for clover is a gra&s;s that will lo&s;e con&s;iderably in its weight by drying.</P>

<P>A load of clover is generally five &s;hillings under the market price of meadow hay; but &s;hould hay be dear, this crop would be more profitable.</P>
<P>It &s;hould not be cut till it has done flowering, and begins to decay at the bot|tom; nor &s;hould it be over-dried in the making.</P>
<P>When de&s;igned for &s;eed, it &s;hould be fir&s;t cut for hay, and eight or ten days
<PB N="102" REF="112">earlier than when the &s;econd cut is made for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. A &s;eed-crop is a very precarious one. A wet harve&s;t will de&s;troy it; and if it does not flower well, the quantity will be &s;mall. The &s;econd growth generally determines the farmer in this matter. If the herbage be large, it &s;hould not be left for &s;eed, as it will be apt to fall before the &s;eed is ripe, and da|mage the crop. When the herbage is &s;hort, and blo&s;&s;oms full and large, there is a good pro&s;pect of reaping a profitable harve&s;t. In this ca&s;e, it &s;hould &s;tand till it is quite ripe. Three bu&s;hels and a half of &s;eed from an acre, is a good return.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. OF THE COURSE OF CROPS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops is a principal matter to be attended to. Different plants draw different nouri&s;hment, and from different parts of the land. Tho&s;e with horizontal roots from one part, tho&s;e with tap-roots from another. Some require cleaner ground than others, and &s;ome land in better heart. Again, &s;ome &s;oils are better adapted to cer|tain crops than others. All this obliges the farmer to &s;tudy a little the nature of his land, and the method of cropping it: and experience has taught him, that it is mo&s;t profitable, after the ground has been well fallowed and cleaned, to pur&s;ue the following method of cropping.</P>

<P>Where the land is naturally rich, or made &s;o by ample and frequent dre&s;&s;ings,
<PB N="107" REF="117">a &s;ummer fallow may not be nece&s;&s;ary, which is de&s;igned only to re&s;t the ground, and de&s;troy the weeds. Dung naturally fills the land with weeds; but a crop of turneps or tares will &s;mother them, and render it clean again: for this rea&s;on, I recommend dre&s;&s;ing the land for turneps, or tares, in preference to wheat.</P>
<P>Mr. Young tells us, that he has tried beans upon the &s;ame ground for three or four years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and has every fu|ture year had a better and a better crop. This he attributes to hoeing the land two or three times in the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer. There is no rea&s;on to doubt his veracity, but it is not the common practice of farmers; indeed, where the &s;oil is natural|ly rich, where it has been dre&s;&s;ed for wheat, and the crop has been lodged from its luxuriancy, farmers have &s;owed the &s;ame land with wheat again the next year, and found their account in it; for if land
<PB N="108" REF="118">be too rich for wheat, it is apt to lodge with wind or heavy rains, and be con&s;ider|ably damaged.</P>

<P>If the land be naturally poor, the more it is re&s;ted the better; of cour&s;e, the longer
<PB N="109" REF="119">it lies under clover, the larger will be the crop that follows it. Indeed, as poor land is generally low rented, laying it down in pa&s;ture is the mo&s;t profitable way of farm|ing it; e&s;pecially if dre&s;&s;ing cannot be readily procured. By feeding, land is an|nually manured and enriched; and, at the &s;ame time, pays no great tythes, a circum|&s;tance very plea&s;ing to the occupier, where tythes are paid in kind. In&s;tead of a fallow once in &s;ix or &s;even years, it will be found frequently nece&s;&s;ary to let poor land lie a year uncropped, once in three or four years; for if (in the farmer's phra&s;e) it be over|driven, without a much greater quantity of manure than he generally has to be&s;tow upon it, it will often produce little more than the &s;eed, be the ground ever &s;o clean.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. OF PLOUGHING AND HARROWING.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome few ob&s;er|vations on this head, both as to the na|ture of the ploughing, the time when, and the number of ploughings.</P>
<P>I would, in the fir&s;t place, recommend it to every occupier of land to employ a very good ploughman, one who knows how to plough and &s;ow well, and one who will not want watching. A team of two hor&s;es in light, and four in &s;tiff land, will plough an acre, or more, in the cour&s;e of a day; one acre is the cu&s;tomary allotment of a day's work, and is generally perform|ed in eight hours. The team u&s;ually leaves work at two o'clock; but it is better for the
<PB N="118" REF="128">hor&s;es in &s;ummer time to get to work at four or five, and quit before the heat of the day.</P>
<P>All that is nece&s;&s;ary for a ma&s;ter to take care of, is, that his ploughman does not ride upon the handles of the plough, but plough the ground as deep as the plough will effect it, or as the upper &s;taple or layer of the land will admit.</P>
<P>Plants that have tap-roots, as beans, carrots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thrive be&s;t in deep earth, which has induced many to trench-plough their land: but for corn, the common depth of five inches is preferable to deeper ploughing. As I &s;aid before, I am no ad|vocate for turning up the clay or gravel, and mixing it with the mould; and for this rea&s;on; that it will require a long &s;eries of tillage, to bring &s;uch &s;oil as is thus turned up into the &s;ame &s;tate with the &s;urface: and it is contrary to the general practice of hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="129">We are next to take care that the ridges lie hand&s;ome, round, and even. In dry &s;oils, the ridges may be broad and flat; but in wet moi&s;t ground, the higher and narrower the ridges are, the drier it will lie. In wet clayey &s;oils, I have ever found three or four bout-lands the be&s;t, as in harrowing, the hor&s;es may walk in the fur|rows, and thus avoid poaching it. The furrows between the ridges &s;hould, when the work is done, lie clean, &s;o that the water can run freely off; and water|furrows &s;hould be made in all depending places, to carry it clean away into the ditches. This cannot be well done but by the &s;pade, and men &s;hould be employed for the purpo&s;e; for unle&s;s the crop lies dry, it will turn out a poor one. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to drain all wet &s;lanks; for where the water &s;tands, the crop common|ly fails. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, at the la&s;t ploughing, in moi&s;t ri&s;ing land, the fur|rows &s;hould be up and down the hill; but
<PB N="120" REF="130">in hungry, burning &s;oils, it may be pro|per to leave the ridges acro&s;s the hill, in order to hold the water and the dre&s;&s;ing, which otherwi&s;e might, in heavy rains, be wa&s;hed away.</P>
<P>As to the time of ploughing, this mu&s;t be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, regulated by the weather; for, in wet &s;oils, there are times when the plough cannot go upon the land. In &s;tiff clays, where a winter fallow is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to mellow and break the clods, the &s;tubbles &s;hould be always broken up in autumn; but where winter fallows are not nece&s;&s;ary, autumnal ploughings may, for want of time, be omitted; e&s;pecially when the ground is de&s;igned for beans or turneps the next year. Such a crop, receiving no very great advantage from ploughing in autumn, the &s;tubbles may as well be left for the feed of &s;heep; for autumnal &s;tir|rings are de&s;igned to de&s;troy the roots of weeds by fro&s;ts, and to pulverize the land.
<PB N="121" REF="131">this is more nece&s;&s;ary for barley or oats, than for a crop that can be hoed, as hoe|ing the ground will effectually de&s;troy the weeds. But, in wet &s;oils, when &s;uch autumnal ploughings are given, care &s;hould be taken to ridge up the land, and water|furrow it &s;o as to lay it dry, otherwi&s;e, where we mean to do good, we &s;hall chill the land, and do a great deal of harm.</P>
<P>Farmers vary in their opinions re&s;pect|ing the number of ploughings on different &s;oils. In &s;trong lands, ill adapted to cer|tain crops that thrive be&s;t in lighter ones, as turneps, clover, barley, peas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the more we pulverize the &s;oil the better, which cannot be done but by many ploughings, rollings, and harrowings; and where we wi&s;h to &s;ummer fallow and clean the land from weeds, it is only to be done by frequent &s;tirring it; but when we mean to &s;ow it with &s;uch grain as delights in &s;trong land,
<PB N="122" REF="132">as wheat, beans, oats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> many plough|ings are not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but may be injurious. The &s;ame rea&s;oning will hold good in light land, provided it be clean; one ploughing is better for wheat, beans, or oats, than three; but where it is nece&s;|&s;ary to clean the land, as in fallows, or turnep-&s;ea&s;ons, if the farmer has time, and can do it with his own team, &s;o as not to be&s;tow more expence upon the land than it will pay, he cannot well plough it too much.</P>
<P>All that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with re|&s;pect to harrowing is, that every farmer &s;hould have three pair of harrows of dif|ferent &s;izes: a large heavy pair for three or four hor&s;es; a &s;maller pair for two hor&s;es; and a le&s;s pair for one. The great harrows follow the plough, the next &s;ize pulverize the land, and the &s;mall harrows are chiefly u&s;ed for harrowing
<PB N="123" REF="133">in the &s;eed. The land being ploughed in order to clean it, we cannot well make too much u&s;e of the harrows, for it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to bring it into fine tilth, and not &s;uffer a weed to grow.</P>
<P>If the land be not a &s;trong clay, &s;even or eight acres harrowed, twice over in a place, with the great harrows, is a good day's work. Smaller harrows &s;hould go three or four times in a place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XV. OF WEEDING.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been ob&s;erved that, clean our land ever &s;o well, time will naturally foul it, and that the carrying on of dung will contribute to &s;uch foulne&s;s; where|ever we find obnoxious weeds ri&s;e with a crop that cannot be hoed, it &s;hould be hand-weeded, by going up the fur|rows, reaching acro&s;s the ridges, and pulling up &s;uch weeds by the roots; for, were they &s;uffered to &s;eed, in&s;tead of one weed, without a fre&s;h fallow, we &s;hould have the next year a thou&s;and. Catlock, poppy, docks, thi&s;tles, all &s;hould be clean pulled out; and whenever we find the la&s;t even in the hedge-rows, they &s;hould con&s;tantly be cut down before they &s;eed;
<PB N="125" REF="135">we never can have a clean farm without; for the &s;eed of the thi&s;tle is winged, and will fly with the lea&s;t breath of air from field to field. Weeding the crop has &s;aved the nece&s;&s;ity of many a fallow, which is the lo&s;s of a year's rent, and the annual expence of the team.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;tudy the cleanne&s;s of their ground, will take care to weed their dung|hills from time to time, and &s;ow no grain but &s;uch as is free from the &s;eeds of weeds.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. OF HEDGING AND DITCHING.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT they call dead hedges are the cu&s;tomary fences in my neighbour|hood; and, I apprehend, this method of inclo&s;ing fields is very general throughout the kingdom, except in counties where they have plenty of &s;tone, of which they make walls. Gentlemen and opulent far|mers, who &s;tudy more the neatne&s;s of their farms, than the article of profit, will plant their banks with quicks, or white thorn. Such a fence, no doubt, is beautiful, &s;e|cure, when properly grown, and, if cut with &s;heers once or twice in the &s;ummer, will la&s;t a great number of years; but it is certainly an expen&s;ive one: for, be&s;ides the annual labour of clipping, the farmer
<PB N="127" REF="137">lo&s;es the advantage he would otherwi&s;e receive in the &s;pare wood, which will &s;up|ply his copper and his oven; and let a quick&s;et hedge be ever &s;o good, it is not impenetrable to hogs.</P>
<P>Dead hedges are fences made by cutting the ragged rambling hedge clo&s;e down to the bank, repairing the bank by ca&s;ting the contents of the ditch upon it, driving in &s;takes between two and three feet long, filling the lower part with bu&s;hes, and weaving it to the top between the &s;takes with hazles, or any pliable &s;ticks of &s;ome length. A man will complete four or five rods, or perches, of &s;uch a fence in the common way, in the cour&s;e of ten or twelve hours; and the cu&s;tomary price with us is from three pence to four pence a rod, and two &s;hillings a hundred for the faggots he makes with the &s;pare wood, with the liber|ty of taking home a faggot, worth two or three pence more, each night on his leaving
<PB N="128" REF="138">work. Such a fence, with occa&s;ional mend|ing, will la&s;t five or &s;ix years, till the wood in the hedge is &s;ufficiently grown to re|make it. Making this fence is, in fact, attended with no expence, as the faggots obtained at every &s;uch making, are gene|rally worth twice the value of the labour.</P>
<P>If the adjoining ditch be &s;ufficiently cleaned out to let the water pa&s;s freely, the bank be &s;mooth and tight, and the hedge even and &s;trong, which may be known, by put|ting our hand upon the top and &s;haking it in different places, the fence is well made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. OF THRESHING.</HEAD>
<P>SOME farmers choo&s;e this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be done by the day, others by the quarter. Tho&s;e who are for the fir&s;t mode, give this as their rea&s;on; that when men work by the day, they generally do their work better, being in no hurry to get it done: whereas, when they thre&s;h by the quarter, they &s;eldom beat the corn clean out. Tho&s;e who are for the other mode, argue thus: if men thre&s;h by the day, unle&s;s the ma&s;ter's eye is con&s;tantly upon them, they will wa&s;te their time, and of cour&s;e, in the end, he will pay more for his thre&s;hing than if the work was done by the quarter; and as to not beating it out clean, that is the ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s, he mu&s;t examine it, and &s;ee that the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="130" REF="140">be properly executed. In mo&s;t counties men wi&s;h to thre&s;h by the quarter; as by working hard, and a greater number of hours than is the u&s;ual complement of a day's work, they can earn more money in the cour&s;e of the week. This principle has made it difficult to find men to thre&s;h by the day; and, indeed, if hone&s;t men are employed, I think it mo&s;t plea&s;ant both for ma&s;ter and man, that the work be done by the quarter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. OF MANURING.</HEAD>
<P>MANURING of land is of &s;uch im|portance to a farmer, that he who omits it mu&s;t never expect a good crop; indeed, it is the very life of hu&s;bandry, and the cultivation of land cannot go on without it. In the neighbourhood of great towns, plenty may be had, and at a very rea&s;onable price; but what are farmers to do who live too remote to enjoy &s;uch an advantage? Where manure is not to be met with on the farm it&s;elf, or in its vi|cinage, a method mu&s;t be contrived to make it; and this can be done only by keeping as large a &s;tock of cattle as the farm will admit of, and by other modes which I &s;hall point out.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="143">Stable dung is one of the be&s;t manures; and, if purcha&s;ed (where it <HI>can</HI> be purcha&s;|ed), is worth upon the farm from five &s;hil|lings to ten &s;hillings a load; ten or twelve of &s;uch loads is an ample dre&s;&s;ing for an acre of land, and will keep it in good heart, if kept clean, for five or &s;ix years. To rai&s;e then the greate&s;t quantity upon a farm from a given number of hor&s;es, is the matter in que&s;tion. This is to be done by keeping them all the year round in the &s;table, and littering them well; in which ca&s;e, a hor&s;e will, on an average, make twenty-&s;even or twenty-eight loads, which will manure three acres well; but to effect this, it will take four loads and a half of &s;traw to each hor&s;e; which, if the farm will not &s;upply, &s;hould be purcha&s;ed. Sup|po&s;e the&s;e four loads and a half to co&s;t 3 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and to produce twenty-eight loads of dung; the price <HI>per</HI> load will then be under half a crown. Fern, where it can be got, is a tolerable &s;ub&s;titute for
<PB N="134" REF="144">&s;traw; but a farm generally yields &s;uffici|ent litter to make the purcha&s;e of it unne|ce&s;&s;ary. The &s;tubble of the fields might be mowed or harrowed up in fro&s;ty weather, and &s;tacked for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Farm-yard dung is the next in quality; and where cattle are foddered the winter through, and the yard well &s;pread with litter, they will, upon an average, yield &s;ix or &s;even loads <HI>per</HI> head, &s;o that two cows will manure an acre. Where cattle are &s;tall-fed for fattening, two bea&s;ts will, if well littered, yield about twenty-three loads of dung in the &s;pace of fifteen weeks.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be a farmer's &s;tudy to make a compo&s;t dunghill at every field-gate. For this purpo&s;e, he &s;hould carry there all the manures he can pick up. Cleanings of ponds or ditches, chalk, earth, clay, a&s;hes; the dung of hogs, gee&s;e, pigeons, poul|try,
<PB N="135" REF="145">brick-rubbi&s;h, or any thing he can get, &s;uch as the li&s;t below points out; this, if well mixed together, with a little lime, and turned once or twice in the year, will turn out an excellent manure for gra&s;s, clover, or any other purpo&s;e. But he &s;hould take care to keep &s;uch dunghills free from weeds.</P>
<P>When land is dre&s;&s;ed at the rate of ten cart-loads <HI>per</HI> acre, each cart &s;hould con|tain &s;ufficient to make &s;ixteen heaps, as parcelled out in the field; and one &s;uch heap &s;hould be allotted to, and &s;ufficient, to cover one &s;quare rod of ground, there be|ing one hundred and &s;ixty &s;quare rods in each acre. But where the &s;oil is in tole|rable good condition, eight loads <HI>per</HI> acre will be &s;ufficient for wheat, as ten loads of good dung may make the crop too lux|uriant, and occa&s;ion it to fall before har|ve&s;t. With eight loads, one &s;uch heap
<PB N="136" REF="146">&s;hould be appropriated to rather more than a &s;quare rod of land.</P>
<P>As the hedges &s;helter birds, which of|ten con&s;ume the crop, and the corn under them, from its warm &s;ituation, is natural|ly drawn up weaker and taller than in more open parts of the field, and of cour&s;e more apt to be lodged; farmers &s;eldom dre&s;s the head-lands of a field when they crop it with wheat.</P>
<P>The following is a li&s;t of manures, with the u&s;es they are fit for, mo&s;t of which are ea&s;ily procured in different places.</P>
<P><HI>Hor&s;e Dung.</HI> When fre&s;h, for cold &s;tiff clays; when rotten, for all &s;orts of land.</P>
<P><HI>Cow Dung.</HI> Rich and cooling; &s;it for dry &s;andy ground.</P>
<P><HI>Hog Dung.</HI> Ditto. This is rather too &s;trong of it&s;elf, but is an excellent mix|ture for the compo&s;t dunghill.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="147"><HI>Dung of Sheep, Rabbits, Goats, Deers, &amp;c.</HI> Very warm, good top dre&s;&s;ing. Fold|ing a flock of &s;heep every night upon fallow ground, is a good practice. Sixty &s;heep will fold an acre in &s;ix weeks, equal to ten loads of dung.</P>
<P><HI>Pigeons Dung.</HI> The hotte&s;t of mo&s;t dungs, good for the compo&s;t dunghill.</P>
<P><HI>Chicken Dung.</HI> For top dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Goo&s;e and Ducks Dung.</HI> Ditto. Some think it &s;poils the gra&s;s, becau&s;e hor&s;es do not like to eat where gee&s;e have fed; but this is owing to the &s;trong &s;alts in it. Where gee&s;e take to &s;itting at nights in a farm-yard, if the place be daily littered and kept clean, they will in the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer make a great deal of dung.</P>
<P><HI>Human Dung</HI> is of &s;o hot a nature, that it is fit only for the compo&s;t dung|hill. If roch-lime be thrown into the ne|ce&s;&s;ary in January, it will remove the of|fen&s;ive &s;mell, and dry it &s;o as to make it &s;pread.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="148"><HI>Human Urine,</HI> and <HI>Urine of Cattle, Dogs, &amp;c.</HI> The &s;ame quality as their re&s;pective dungs; and have this advantage, that they do not produce weeds: if mixed with as much, or two thirds water, it is a good top dre&s;&s;ing, to be &s;prinkled over land with water-carts. Human urine &s;hould be daily thrown upon the dunghill, and the drainings of &s;uch dunghills, with the urine of cattle, &s;hould never be &s;uffer|ed to run off from farm-yards, but, if po&s;|&s;ible, collected in re&s;ervoirs.</P>
<P><HI>Dead Animals</HI> &s;hould be buried in com|po&s;t dunghills.</P>
<P><HI>Blood</HI> from the butchers. A very &s;trong manure; it &s;hould be mixed with earth, &s;and, or &s;aw-du&s;t, for the convenience of carriage, and then u&s;ed as a top dre&s;&s;ing for any land.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>MEADOWS.</HI> To make meadows, or pa&s;tures flouri&s;h, they &s;hould be cut for hay only once in two years: the &s;econd year they &s;hould be fed.</P>
<P>Soap-boilers a&s;hes, which may be pur|cha&s;ed for about three &s;hillings a hundred weight, will effectually de&s;troy thi&s;tles in gra&s;s lands, by mowing the thi&s;tles, and &s;prinkling the a&s;hes lightly over them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cows.</HI> A milch cow will require an acre and three quarters of good meadow, or two acres of indifferent pa&s;ture, to keep her well from May 1, to October 31; or one acre and a half of clover green, will keep
<PB N="145" REF="155">her twenty-three weeks, and enough will be left to keep two &s;heep &s;ix weeks. She will eat, when fed on hay, forty pounds weight a day upon an average; which, for the winter &s;ix months, is four loads and a half. Straw and fifty pounds of tur|neps <HI>per</HI> day, will keep her well before calving.</P>
<P>Whether the farmer weans calves, to &s;ell them at three years old, with calves by their &s;ides; &s;uckles calves for the butcher, or converts the milk of his cows into butter or chee&s;e, each cow will, with management, pay him about five pounds ten &s;hillings, or &s;ix pounds a year; &s;o that he may pro|ceed the way that is attended with lea&s;t trouble, and mo&s;t convenient to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It will require the cream of be|tween &s;ixty and &s;eventy quarts of good milk (&s;uppo&s;e &s;ixty-five) to make five pounds and a quarter of butter; which, at nine
<PB N="146" REF="156">pence <HI>per</HI> pound, is worth three &s;hillings and eleven pence farthing; whereas the &s;ame quantity of milk &s;old at one penny halfpenny <HI>per</HI> quart, would yield eight &s;hillings and three halfpence; but, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the &s;kimmed milk is left for hogs, which may be fattened, if they have plenty, on that alone: and in feeding of hogs, &s;kimmed milk will pay about one halfpenny a quart.</P>
<P>In dairies where chee&s;e is made, butter is generally made of the whey-cream; and in dairies where butter is made, a blue milk chee&s;e is u&s;ually made of the whey|curd.</P>
<P>In buying young cows with calf, make choice of tho&s;e with a fine, long, &s;preading, &s;mall, green, horn, fine and clear of leather under the chops; with a good &s;houlder, deep che&s;ted, broad and well made behind, a &s;traight broad back, full hips, with &s;hort &s;traight legs, a walk open and &s;tately, a
<PB N="147" REF="157">thick &s;kin, broad-ribbed, with a good milk vein and udder, and large teats. Their age may be known by their horns. A cow throws off the tip of her horns, which is called &s;hedding them, at three years old; at four years, a ring or wrinkle is &s;een round each horn, near the ba&s;e; and every future year adds a fre&s;h ring. Thus, two rings denote that &s;he is five years old, three rings &s;ix years, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>In buying &s;tore-heifers, take care they are not bulled before you buy them. A &s;ure token to know they are bulled, is from their having wax in their teats, which may be brought out by drawing them be|tween the fingers. Ob&s;erve al&s;o the barren under the tail, if there is a drop hanging at it, which generally gathers dirt, de|pend upon it &s;he is bulled.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sheep.</HI> To &s;uch as wi&s;h to keep &s;heep, the following e&s;timate will be ac|ceptable.</P>

<P>It will take an acre of gra&s;s to fatten five &s;heep; but where gra&s;s is not plenti|ful, they may be fed on &s;tubble till Chri&s;t|mas, then on turneps till May-day; next on rye, and then on clover till &s;old. No meadow will do for &s;heep in the win|ter, that is wet enough to let them &s;ink up to the fir&s;t joint of their legs; it will rot them.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="159">An acre of turneps will feed one hun|dred &s;heep for ten days, or about eight &s;heep from Chri&s;tmas-day to May-day.</P>
<P>Sheep require a large range of pa&s;ture: two acres and a half of gra&s;s, and two and a half of &s;tubble, be they ever &s;o bare, will keep a &s;heep all the winter till March.</P>
<P>Twelve pounds weight of hay will keep twenty &s;heep and their lambs a week.</P>
<P>An acre of turneps will keep forty &s;heep three weeks, as much as they will eat to fatten them.</P>
<P>Dung of &s;heep, when folded upon land, for the richne&s;s of the manure, is equal in value often to the profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of them. Three&s;core &s;heep folded every night will manure an acre of ground well in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Calves.</HI> A yearling calf will eat about five pounds or &s;ix pounds of hay in
<PB N="150" REF="160">the cour&s;e of the night, by way of fodder in winter <HI>(i. e.),</HI> half a load in &s;ix months. To make them grow, they ought to have the be&s;t hay.</P>
<P>Calves may be weaned with very little milk, by the following method.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t eight days, after they are calved, they &s;hould &s;uck the cow. They &s;hould then be taken from the cow, and the next eight days fed with new milk: the next eight, you may give them three parts new milk and one part hay-tea mixed, made by &s;teeping the be&s;t hay in hot water, and letting it &s;tand till it is cold; the eight fol|lowing days give them half new milk and half hay-tea; the next eight three-fourths hay-tea, and one-fourth milk; and after this, nothing but hay-tea till they will drink water. During this time, they &s;hould have a little fre&s;h hay put daily before them, to tempt them to eat; and,
<PB N="151" REF="161">in the la&s;t three weeks, they &s;hould be turned out into gra&s;s, that they may learn to feed. One cow will thus wean &s;everal calves. Calves &s;o weaned will thrive well and grow, but not equal in &s;ize to tho&s;e that run with the cows all the &s;ummer.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Feed of Cattle.</HI> The greater extent of ground cattle have to range in, the better. Thus, one field of ten acres will fatten or keep more cattle than two fields of five acres each.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Stubbles.</HI> To make the mo&s;t of &s;tubbles; turn gee&s;e into tho&s;e of oats, and pigs into tho&s;e of beans: each mu&s;t have water to have recour&s;e to, or they will not thrive. Where there is no pond, place a trough or two. One month in an oat-&s;tubble will fatten gee&s;e well.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Weight of Wheat, &amp;c.</HI> A bu&s;hel of wheat, weight &s;ixty pounds &s;tandard
<PB N="152" REF="162">(eight gallon mea&s;ure), when ground into meal, and dre&s;&s;ed into flour, gives forty|five pounds one ounce of flour, and twelve pounds of bran, which, when baked, will yield fifty-eight pounds and a half of bread.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> Twelve ounces of yea&s;t, and four ounces of &s;alt, to half a bu&s;hel of flour.</P>
<P>A bu&s;hel of good wheat, nine gallon mea&s;ure, will weigh &s;eventy pounds.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. ON MEASURING OF TIMBER.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of this chapter is rather out of the line of farming; but the work being calculated for the u&s;e of coun|try gentlemen, &s;uch may occa&s;ionally have timber to &s;ell, and to &s;uch, the method of mea&s;uring it may be acceptable.</P>
<P>Timber is paid for by the cubical foot; and to get at the exact dimen&s;ions, they take the girth, or mea&s;ure the circumfe|rence in the middle of the body of the tree, between the root and the part where it forks or branches off. Should there be a &s;well in the middle, the buyer is at liberty to take the girth in any place nearer the root.</P>
<P>The girth thus taken, four inches are allowed for rind, and the remaining num|ber, of which the girth con&s;i&s;ts, mu&s;t be
<PB N="159" REF="169">fir&s;t multiplied by it&s;elf; the product in inches mu&s;t then be multiplied by the num|ber of feet, of which the length of the body of the tree con&s;i&s;ts, and this product being divided by 144, the cubical inches in a foot, gives the true cubical feet in the tree.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>What are the cubical feet in a tree 17 feet long, who&s;e girth is 9 inches? An&s;wer, as below; 9 feet 6 inches.</P>
<GAP DESC="math">
<P>The top of the tree is generally given to the purcha&s;er for cutting it down, and car|rying it away.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="170">All under 6 inches in girth is accounted top, and not timber.</P>
<P>Where there is a fork, above 6 inches in girth, one of the prong pieces only is rec|koned in the length.</P>
<P>Fifty &s;olid, or cubical feet, is called a load.</P>
<P>No part of a tree that is not found is mea&s;ured into the length.</P>
<P>Gunter's &s;liding rule is that by which timber is mea&s;ured. This rule, with a book of explanations, may be bought at any mathematical in&s;trument-maker's.</P>
