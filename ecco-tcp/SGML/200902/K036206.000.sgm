<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Truly wi&s;h this Play were more worthy of your Lady&s;hip's Name. Yet I do not pre&s;ume to offer it to you for its poetical Merit. I dedi|cate to you, Madam, the Virtues of your Sex. Whatever &s;eems to me mo&s;t amiable and e&s;timable in Wo|man, I have endeavoured to &s;hew in the Characters of <HI>Eugenia</HI> and <HI>Or|phi&s;a.</HI> In <HI>Orphi&s;a,</HI> that Fortitude of Spirit, that Dignity of Sentiments, that exalted Under&s;tanding, which, in my Ideas, form the Woman of Quality; and in <HI>Eugenia,</HI> that Purity of Heart, that Gentlene&s;s of Di&s;po&s;i|tion, that filial Piety, which give to Youth its be&s;t, its true&s;t Loveline&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3">
Whether I have &s;ucceeded, your Lady&s;hip, in your own Feelings and Experience, can be&s;t determine. If I have, let me be bold to expect your Patronage. It is for the Intere&s;t of that Virtue, which you love; for it is not &s;ufficient, Madam, to practi&s;e her Precepts in your own private Life; you mu&s;t come forth and do her Honour by a public Appearance in her Favour. In her Name, I ex|pect your Protection; in her Name, let me dare to promi&s;e, my future Life, and its be&s;t Gratitude &s;hall de|&s;erve it.&mdash;I am,</P>

<P>IT may not be improper to tell an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader &s;ome Circum&s;tances of this Play. The Character of <HI>AEMILIA,</HI> con&s;equently her Scenes with <HI>MERCOUR,</HI> is wholly new. The Fable, excepting &s;ome Alterations, which &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, with regard to the Difference of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, is taken from a Comedy publi&s;hed la&s;t Year by Madame <HI>Grafigny.</HI></P>
<P>Let me be permitted to take this Opportunity of return|ing my be&s;t Thanks to the &s;everal Performers, for the Chearfulne&s;s, with which they went through the Fatigue of Rehear&s;ing and Acting. The Public is the be&s;t Judge of their Merit, and its Favour the be&s;t Proof of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> is intitled to my &s;incere&s;t Gratitude, for his Performance as an Actor, and for his Punctuality, as a Manager; but his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in a thou&s;and Altera|tions, his &s;trong good Sen&s;e, with that Spirit of Theatrical Critici&s;m, which is his peculiar natural Genius, give him a Right to a great Share of that Applau&s;e, with which this Play was received. The re&s;t is Friend&s;hip and E&s;teem.</P>
