<P>THE LIVERPOOL PRIZE; A FARCE: IN TWO ACTS. AS IT PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN, WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE. WRITTEN BY F. PILON.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been in&s;inuated, that the Li|verpool Prize was written in the &s;pirit of party, the author takes this opportunity of publicly declaring, that nothing could be further from his intention than &s;uch an idea. If the maritime phra&s;es &s;o often re|peated on a late public occa&s;ion, be deem|ed &s;atire in di&s;gui&s;e, he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf too dull to find it out; it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid u&s;ing them, in painting a &s;ailor like Teneriffe: but admitting they were &s;elected in con&s;equence of their being temporary, the writer of the Liverpool Prize has done no more in u&s;ing them, than the be&s;t dra|matic writers have done before him, and, indeed, ought to continue to do, if the &s;tage be the mirror of the times. Di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
as Shake&s;peare was, and above the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tooping to temporary allu&s;ions, yet would he &s;ometimes &s;acrifice to them, in order to gratify the public; a circum|&s;tance which has contributed not a little to that ob&s;curity in his writings which has &s;o long amu&s;ed and perplexed the critics. As to the liberty the author took in mention|ing Admiral Keppel's name, he hopes no man is &s;o great an enemy to his country as to a&s;cribe it to party; it was the tribute of his heart; an echo to the voice of a whole nation, loud in prai&s;e of a man who had &s;o often fought the battles of Old England with &s;ucce&s;s, and in who&s;e hands the ho|nour of the Briti&s;h flag can never tarni&s;h.</P>

<STAGE>Looking round with &s;urprize.</STAGE>
<L>'Sdeath! where am I? What! &s;tumbled on the &s;tage?</L>
<L>No wonder that, in this &s;atyric age;</L>
<L>Here mark&s;man Wit &s;hoots at all game that flies,</L>
<L>One night a Nabob&mdash;next a Mole&s;worth dies.</L>
<L>Why even this I could &s;uppo&s;e Guildhall,</L>

<L>Then round in expectation buyers &s;it,</L>
<L>Before me the Commi&s;&s;ioners, in the Pit,</L>
<L>Who meet in judgment on each mu&s;e-&s;truck vot'ry,</L>
<L>And on the&s;e hu&s;tings Genius has its Lott'ry.</L>
<L>All the world's a &s;tage&mdash;old Shake&s;peare declares,</L>
<L>And all the men and women merely play'rs.</L>
<L>Did Shake&s;peare's genius light the pre&s;ent day,</L>
<L>All the world's a lott'ry, I'm &s;ure, he'd &s;ay.</L>

<L>Phy&s;ic's another, of which, friends, beware,</L>
<L>For death and the doctor all the prizes &s;hare.</L>

<P>Neither&mdash;He has both hands and feet at liber|ty, and is now &s;itting with his con&s;tant companion, Captain Teneriffe, over his evening pipe.</P>
