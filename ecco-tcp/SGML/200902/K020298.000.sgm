<P>AS the OLD MAID is now adven|turing into the world, it would be proper to acquaint the mere Engli&s;h reader, that the &s;ubject of it, and part of the fable, were taken from a <HI>little piece,</HI> in one act, called, <HI>L'Etourderie,</HI> by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fagan.</HI> but that the author of the&s;e &s;cenes is &s;en&s;ible, how &s;uperfluous that information will be rendered by the a&s;&s;iduity of &s;ome people, who, no doubt, will make a notable di&s;covery of this prodigious crime, and pre&s;s it home with all the reproaches of <HI>plagiari&s;m, pilfer|ing, borrowing, robbing, tran&s;lating,</HI> &amp;c. But while this writer can add any thing to the decent amu&s;ements of the public, he is willing to be abu&s;ed for it, in what|ever manner the illiberal &s;hall think fit.</P>
