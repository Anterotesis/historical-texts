<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Intended to have been Spoken by Mr. FOOTE.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>THE Contract is it call'd?&mdash;I cannot &s;ay,</L>
<L>I much admire the title of his play;</L>
<L>Contracts, they tell me, have been fraught with evil,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> &s;ign'd his Contract with&mdash;the <HI>Devil;</HI></L>
<L>Yet, &s;pite of <HI>Satan,</HI> all men love to make 'em,</L>
<L>Tho' nineteen out of twenty wi&s;h to break 'em:</L>
<L>Butchers and meal-men, brewers, agents, factors,</L>
<L>Pimps, poets, placemen, managers, and actors,</L>
<L>Bawds, bankrupts, book&s;ellers, are all&mdash;Contractors,</L>
<L>All lye, and &s;wear, and cheat, t' increa&s;e their &s;tore,</L>
<L>Then die, and go&mdash;where <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> went before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whil&s;t thus o'er all we &s;ee th' infection &s;pread,</L>
<L>No wonder it &s;hou'd taint the marriage bed;</L>
<L>Each wife forgets, each hu&s;band breaks his vow,</L>
<L>For what are Contracts? what is wedlock now?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Garrick,</HI> who long was marry'd&mdash;to the town,</L>
<L>At length, a fa&s;hionable hu&s;band grown,</L>
<L>For&s;akes his &s;pou&s;e; ba&s;e man! for, truth to tell,</L>
<L>She lov'd her own dear <HI>Davy</HI> wond'rous well;</L>
<L><PB REF="3">
Tho' now he &s;lights her, breaks from her by force,</L>
<L>And nought will &s;erve him but a full divorce.</L>
<L>But be the fault in women or in men,</L>
<L>Thanks to our laws! they all may&mdash;wed again;</L>
<L>Her faithle&s;s fav'rite gone, the Lady's free,</L>
<L>To choo&s;e another, and may &s;mile&mdash;on me,</L>
<L>To the <HI>Lame Lover</HI> may re&s;ign her charms,</L>
<L>And, tho' a cripple, take me to her arms:</L>
<L>I'll promi&s;e to be con&s;tant, kind, polite,</L>
<L>And pay my duty&mdash;every other night:</L>
<L>My dear-lov'd rib I never will abandon,</L>
<L>But &s;tand by her whil&s;t I've <HI>ONE</HI> leg to &s;tand on;</L>
<L>I'll make a &s;olemn <HI>Contract,</HI> play or pay,</L>
<L>And hope we &s;hall not part this many a day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our brother &s;cribbler too, I greatly fear,</L>
<L>Has made a fooli&s;h kind of Contract here,</L>
<L>He promi&s;es, and ten to one you're bit,</L>
<L>To furni&s;h fable, &s;entiment and wit:</L>
<L>I've &s;een his piece, the man appeal'd to me,</L>
<L>And I, as chancellor, i&s;&s;ued my decree;</L>
<L>T'has pa&s;s'd the &s;eals&mdash;they're going to rehear&s;e it,</L>
<L>But you're the <HI>Hou&s;e of Peers</HI>&mdash;and may rever&s;e it.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Ma'am, you wrong your charms; in my opinion, you have not look'd &s;o well the&s;e five years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, go, you're a wicked flatterer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed but I a'nt, Ma'am. Be&s;ides, if you were a little older, you'd be young enough yet I think, for the Colonel. Methinks, Ma'am, 'tis a thou&s;and pities you two did not come to|gether &s;ome fifteen or twenty years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Betty, I wi&s;h we <HI>had;</HI> but then matters did not &s;uit. You mu&s;t know the Co|lonel was under the direction of an old &s;urly guardian, who wanted him to marry his niece; and becau&s;e he refu&s;ed, kept him out of
<PB N="4" REF="8">
his fortune by law and chicanery;&mdash;whil&s;t I was teiz'd to death by an immortal old aunt, who threatened to di&s;inherit me, if I married without her con&s;ent.&mdash;About five years ago I became my own mi&s;tre&s;s, with &s;ome thou|&s;ands in my pocket, and then the Colonel was gone to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, to be &s;ure, he was out of luck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since that, however, his advancement in the army, with the e&s;tate left him by his uncle, and the law-&s;uit with his guardian determined in his favour, have made him a match for the be&s;t fortune in the kingdom, at the age of&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Near &s;ixty&mdash;I'll an&s;wer for it.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, Betty, whil&s;t we were young we had nothing but love to be&s;tow one another; and <HI>now</HI> we have&mdash;</P>

<P>Every thing el&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even &s;o, indeed.&mdash;But the wor&s;t of the &s;tory is yet to come: for do you know, Betty, &s;uch fools were <HI>we,</HI> &s;uch ab&s;olute &s;trangers to human nature, as to vow everla&s;ting fidelity to each other, and to enter into&mdash;</P>

<P>No contract, I hope.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9">

<P>The very thing.&mdash;To enter into contract ne|ver to marry any body el&s;e, under forfeiture of every thing we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and you intend to perform it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, Betty. What! marry a worn-out &s;oldier of &s;ixty!&mdash;and turn nur&s;e!&mdash;Be&s;ides, the&s;e poor remains of beauty are not worth his acceptance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have no other rea&s;on in nature?&mdash;no, to be &s;ure:&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! I find how it is then.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do'nt &s;u&s;pect my con&s;tancy, I hope: do you know, Mrs. Betty, I &s;hall be very angry with you?</P>

Spritely, is ju&s;t returned from his travels; and that he is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t, be&s;t-made, mo&s;t agreeable young fellows in the whole county&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Betty, hold your impertinent tongue&mdash;hold your tongue this minute, or&mdash;Do you really think the Captain is &s;o hand&s;ome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; and what's more, I believe has no di&s;like to your lady&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t horribly in love with him&mdash;</P>

<P>No; not that&mdash;but what if he &s;hould <HI>not</HI> like <HI>me?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous! let me &s;ee e'er a young adven|turer in England, without &s;ix-pence to his for|tune, refu&s;e a woman of your &s;en&s;e and beauty with twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what mu&s;t I do with the poor Colonel! By the la&s;t letters I had from him, he depends on marrying me the moment he returns: the very hou&s;e I am now in, and the furniture be|longing to it, are <HI>his;</HI> he reque&s;ted me, in the mo&s;t tender manner, to live in it 'till he came, and to con&s;ider every thing that belonged to him as much <HI>my</HI> property as his own faithful heart: what's to be done, Betty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Done, Madam? why turn him off at once, and take the Captain. Why, there is no more now-a-days in changing one's lover than in changing ones linen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but this plaguy contract&mdash;&s;igned and &s;ealed, Betty,</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that circum&s;tance, indeed, is rather again&s;t us; but time, Madam, time may re|concile all things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Betty; but how to keep off the old lover, and to bring on the <HI>new</HI> one&mdash;that&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Madam, <HI>that</HI>'s the que&s;tion&mdash;Let <HI>me</HI> &s;ee&mdash;O! I have it. If the mountain won't come to Mahomet, why, then Mahomet mu&s;t come to the mountain&mdash;that <HI>is,</HI> if <HI>you</HI> cannot go to the Captain, why, then the Captain mu&s;t come to <HI>you.</HI></P>
