<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the opinion of Horace, Rabelais, and Le Sage, of Cervantes, Swift, and Fielding, and many other names familiar to every man of reading, that <HI>laughing</HI> &s;a|tire was the likelie&s;t to &s;ucceed, as it always &s;trikes the <HI>honied &s;ting</HI> more deep into the heart. Benignus &s;eemed to have entertain|ed the &s;ame idea; now and then yielding to the <HI>pathetic,</HI> but never indulging the <HI>pa&s;&s;ion|ate,</HI> yet Juvenal him&s;elf had not more cau&s;e to be out of temper. It is, indeed, mo&s;t likely, the author of this Hi&s;tory apprehend|ed,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">with Young, that "the world is too proud to be fond of a <HI>&s;erious</HI> tutor," and that if his narrative &s;hould ever get in|to print, it would &s;tand little chance to be <HI>well</HI> read (that is, to be read agreeably and <HI>advantageou&s;ly</HI>) had he gratified the mere dictates of de&s;pair; had he left nothing be|hind him, but a dull detail of his injuries, with the complaints of a gloomy reclu&s;e, and the de&s;pondencies of a dying hermit. In one of his chapters he mentions this; and, accordingly, he &s;et down every &s;cene (without the formality and punctilio of author&s;hip) exactly as he felt it upon re|calling it to mind; and I make no doubt but that, while he was thus faithfully en|gaged in de&s;cribing his adventures, it hu&s;hed for a while the &s;en&s;e of his misfor|tunes,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">and he probably forgot (&s;uch is the con&s;equence, and &s;uch the importance of exerci&s;ing the mind) that he was, in fact, a &s;olitary &s;elf-bani&s;hed man, in the re|ce&s;&s;es of a fore&s;t.&mdash;For my <HI>own part,</HI> I have nothing to tell the reader, but that I wi&s;h, with all my heart, he may find as much entertainment in peru&s;ing the&s;e adventures, as I have found in tran&s;cribing them from the manu&s;cript; the &s;pirit of which is not <HI>even yet,</HI> I tru&s;t, exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>I cannot, however, take my leave of the reader, (as the editor of Benignus) with|out briefly obviating certain objections which were made, by &s;ome, to the <HI>moral</HI> tendency of the former part of the Hi&s;tory. Let me declare, therefore, that the adven|tures of Benignus are not &s;o much recom|mended
<PB N="viii" REF="7">as objects of regular imitation, as of general e&s;cape. The goodne&s;s of that per&s;on's heart, and the integrity of his in|tentions may &s;afely be propo&s;ed as the pure&s;t &s;tandards; but his pa&s;&s;ion for travel and the exce&s;s of his undi&s;tingui&s;hing boun|ty, with the various inconveniences and aukward perplexities ari&s;ing from thence, are examples rather to terrify than to follow. His unlimited benevolence, &s;o far from promoting, defeats the felicity which would ari&s;e from a better directed, and a judicious genero&s;ity: and nothing more was intended by the expre&s;&s;ion, that, <HI>"nine times out of ten, to be extremely good, is not, in this world, the way to be happy,"</HI> than this, that when liberality lo&s;es its name by rambling into profu&s;ion; when the hand
<PB N="ix" REF="8">indi&s;creetly gives, without the &s;uffrage of the under&s;tanding, though the de&s;igns of the heart may be ever &s;o amiable, it cea&s;es to be, in fact, goodne&s;s, and is therefore nine times out of ten rewarded by the con|tempt of oeconomy, the ridicule of im|po&s;ture, and the trick of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>To warn the unwary then; to put &s;im|plicity upon guard; to regulate the kinde&s;t, noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and to &s;hew the delicate par|tition, which divides humanity from weak|ne&s;s, and feeling from folly, the&s;e Memoirs are publi&s;hed; in which (for &s;uch purpo&s;es) are exhibited &s;cenes of hazard, enterprizes of moment, and a diver&s;ity of characters, not, I hope, ill adapted to the occa&s;ion. I earne&s;tly beg the Hi&s;tory may be read with the&s;e views, and I as ardently wi&s;h any
<PB N="x" REF="9">imprudence may be avoided, or any di&s;cre|tion acquired by the peru&s;al.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething for hav|ing prefixed a Table of Contents to the&s;e vo|lumes, contrary to the de&s;ign of Benignus, who&s;e opinion upon upon this &s;ubject will be &s;een in the &s;ixty-&s;ixth chapter&mdash;To works, however, of this nature, it is not only cu&s;tomary to give &s;hort introductory &s;ummaries, but it was even whi&s;pered to the editor, by &s;everal <HI>gentle</HI> readers, that &s;uch pithy hints at the head of a chapter were not only agreeable, and convenient, but even hone&s;t and con&s;cientious in an au|thor; for, &s;aid they, if we like the promi&s;ed matter in the <HI>general,</HI> we enter readily into the <HI>particulars:</HI> if we do not, we turn over the leaves, till we hit upon what is better &s;uited to our ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10">That I may make this Hi&s;tory as plea&s;|ing as po&s;&s;ible, by yielding to the wi&s;h of various tempers, I have taken the freedom of an editor, to humour certain readers in this article: but, that I might not too fla|grantly oppo&s;e the intentions of my author, I mu&s;t beg leave at the &s;ame time to ob|&s;erve, that I have managed my information with &s;ome &s;kill and oeconomy; and, though a little is anticipated, a great deal more will be found in every chapter, than can, or in|deed <HI>ought</HI> to be told, at the top: and therefore it is my &s;erious and earne&s;t ad|vice, as a fair dealing editor, between au|thor and reader, that (le&s;t any entertain|ment &s;hould be lo&s;t) the whole &s;hould be read through with candour and re&s;olution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the tumultuous bu&s;tle, which on all &s;ides at|tracted my attention, as I advanced into the city, it was late enough in the evening for a country gentleman to expect more appearance of tranqui|lity;
<PB N="2" REF="17">and indeed, certain I am, more than half the inhabitants of my vil|lage were a&s;leep.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed therefore, along &s;treets, which were illuminated, and &s;hops, which exhibited, with an air of o&s;ten|tation, every thing to view, I gave way to the perfect &s;implicity of my &s;oul, and a&s;ked the coachman (for Mr. Greaves had now left me) upon what <HI>public</HI> occa&s;ion, the&s;e <HI>rejoicings</HI> were made? &mdash; Rejoicings, your honour, an&s;wered the fellow, I &s;ee no rejoic|ings for my part: the lamps indeed, burn a little merrily, but &s;o they do every night o' the year, for the mat|ter of that&mdash;Very well, &s;aid I&mdash;drive on bri&s;kly, &s;ir.</P>
<P>So &s;aid, &s;o done; and bri&s;kly he <HI>did</HI> drive with a vengeance; mount|ing
<PB N="3" REF="18">&s;uch precipices, thundering down &s;uch vales, turning &s;uch corners, clat|tering over &s;uch &s;tones, and making &s;uch angles, that (unu&s;ed to &s;o plea&s;|ant an exerci&s;e) I was utterly unable to keep my &s;eat, and was to&s;&s;ed about the coach from one &s;ide to the other, fill a &s;udden jolt drove my head in|continently again&s;t the gla&s;s on the le&s;t hand, which gave me an oppor|tunity to cut my cheek, and hol|low forth my di&s;a&s;ter, to the author of it. I ordered him to go le&s;s fu|riou&s;ly, a&s;&s;uring him, at the &s;ame time, while I applied a handkerchief to my cheek, that I was not an <HI>expre&s;s,</HI> nor upon any errand that required &s;uch hazardous expedition&mdash;Oh, very well, replied this obedient driver, I <HI>ax</HI> your honour's pardon, but I
<PB N="4" REF="19">thought <HI>as how</HI> you might like to go the <HI>long trot.</HI> He now &s;et forward, and crept &s;o provokingly &s;low, that I had full lei&s;ure to contemplate every thing I beheld around me.</P>
<P>At the end of a &s;treet, I &s;aw a cla&s;|ter of <HI>&s;hewy</HI> young women, who &s;eemed to have met by accident, and were re|joicing at the interview; while the coachman, therefore, was indulging his pre&s;ent fit of deliberation, moving as if he had a mind to &s;tand &s;till&mdash; one of the ladies very politely walk|ed by the &s;ide of the coach for &s;ome time, enquired after my health with great a&s;&s;ability, and at la&s;t mo&s;t ho&s;pitably invited me, to <HI>drink a gla&s;s of wine</HI> with her. Struck with the agreeablene&s;s of her figure, and genteel addre&s;s, and not doubting but
<PB N="5" REF="20">that &s;he was &s;ome young lady who had &s;een me either at &s;chool, or at my village (but who&s;e features were worn out of my memory) I made her a pro|found bow of acknowledgement, ex|pre&s;&s;ed my concern at not being able to accept her flattering offer, but would take the fir&s;t opportunity to pay her my re&s;pects. In delivering this &s;entence (while the good-natured creature expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing me, even by a gentle pre&s;&s;ure of the hand) I had the confidence to look in her face, in the hope of recol|lecting an <HI>old friend;</HI> but, &s;uch was the treachery of memory, that, although &s;he actually called me twice or thrice, <HI>her dear,</HI> (which methought denoted particular intimacy) I could no way recognize her. However, I was in
<PB N="6" REF="21">&s;ome mea&s;ure rewarded for my pains, by &s;urveying a countenance, where the ro&s;es and lilies were &s;o <HI>nicely</HI> blend|ed, the brow &s;o delicately arched, and the bo&s;om &s;o exqui&s;itely white, that I congratulated my&s;elf highly at having found &s;o <HI>amiable</HI> an acquaintance, and &s;ignified my intention to wait upon her, at all events, the next day.</P>
<P>All this time, during which, <HI>I</HI> was leaning half out of the window, the coachman was &s;tifling a laugh, which, when it was no longer to be repre&s;&s;|ed, would very well have become the lungs of the animals he was driving. At length, (he cries, turning him&s;elf round upon his box,) why &s;he's a tight going thing, your honour, I'll get down and open the door.&mdash;Will you ride with the gentleman, Be&s;s? what
<PB N="7" REF="22">&s;ay you, hey? Imagining he meant to in&s;ult <HI>my friend,</HI> whom I was bound in honour and indeed in con&s;cience to protect, I exerted my&s;elf warmly in her behalf, in&s;i&s;ted that the fellow &s;hould not affront <HI>my acquaintance,</HI> but go directly where he was ordered; then, addre&s;&s;ing the lady, I was pre|paring a very proper apology for this unparalleled rudene&s;s, when the coach|man with a &s;aucy &s;mack of his whip, &s;o increa&s;ed the &s;peed of the hor&s;es, that I &s;ound my&s;elf at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, before I thought of a&s;king her direction.</P>
<P>This, however, I <HI>now</HI> determined on, and &s;topping the coach, by dint of ab&s;olute vociferation, I command|ed the fellow to drive me back again to the lady, as I had forgot to enquire
<PB N="8" REF="23">in what <HI>&s;treet</HI> &s;he re&s;ided, and where I might find her hou&s;e. Her <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> re|plied the coachman&mdash;&s;omewhat &s;ur|lily, it will be a difficult <HI>jobb of work</HI> to find that, I fancy. She's a <HI>here-and-thereian,</HI> as a man may &s;ay&mdash;&s;he has no hou&s;e&mdash;<HI>No</HI> hou&s;e, &s;aid I! And yet (re|&s;umed the heroe of the long la&s;h) &s;he is pretty well known at <HI>mo&s;t</HI> hou&s;es in town, for all that. What, cried I, is &s;he then a woman of &s;uch <HI>di&s;tinction.</HI> Very great dictinction, he replied&punc; Be&s;s Bron&s;by beats round all the baw|dy hou&s;es in a night, &s;ometimes&mdash; <HI>Bawdy Hou&s;es,</HI> &s;aid I, what is &s;he then &mdash;is <HI>that</HI> lady&mdash;can it be <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that&mdash; that I &s;tammered at a little&mdash;and &s;elt the colour in my face&mdash;I know what your honour would &s;ay, interrupted the coachman; and &s;he is <HI>all that,</HI> I
<PB N="9" REF="24">can a&s;&s;ure you, and more too. A&s;to|ni&s;hment &s;ilenced me, and it was &s;ome time before I was able to &s;ay, go along, coachman, pray go along, &s;ir&mdash;</P>
<P>Reflections now thickened upon me, and thus, at la&s;t, in the language of &s;implicity and inexperience, I argued.</P>
<P>Fair unfortunate! how I pity thee. Thou haply art another <HI>Almeria,</HI> de|te&s;ting thy &s;ad &s;ituation, and &s;hedding many a tear, to the fraud which oc|ca&s;ioned, and to the di&s;a&s;ter which continues it to thee. Haply &s;ome fa|ther, with the &s;eelings of Mr. Greaves, may at this very moment, mourn thy lo&s;s, and thy wanderings &mdash; &mdash;Oh that &s;ome gentle &s;pirit, in&s;pired with benignity, would <HI>intere&s;t</HI> it&s;elf in thy fate&mdash;would exert its friendly en|deavours to &s;weeten it&mdash;Thy <HI>heart</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="25">may not acquie&s;ce in the conce&s;&s;ions of thy <HI>per&s;on;</HI> and if it be &s;o, (as &s;ure|ly the lu&s;tre of thine eye is the lu&s;tre of innocence) do&s;t thou not &s;igh for the compa&s;&s;ion of a friend? do&s;t thou not weep for the bo&s;om of a father? Oh that Providence may be&s;tow the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings upon thee, and may&s;t thou, in a parent's protection, once more find &s;helter from mankind!</P>
<P>I had fini&s;hed this &s;oliloquy ju&s;t as the coach &s;topt in a &s;pacious &s;quare at the hou&s;e of my relation; and after the man had opened the coach-door, I &s;aw a woman moving along, in no &s;ituation to be envied; for &s;he could by no means walk, either direct or an|gular; and tho' well dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he was &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>cur&s;ing</HI> her&s;elf all the way, and prote&s;ted vengeance again&s;t the
<PB N="11" REF="26">very next &s;coundrel &s;he &s;hould meet&mdash; what's the matter with you, poor wo|man, &s;aid I, &s;tepping out of the coach: are you &s;ubject to fits? Fits be d&mdash;d, replied the lady&mdash;O, yes cries the coachman, look your honour how <HI>woundily &s;trong</HI> they are upon her <HI>now.</HI> Alack-a-day, poor &s;oul, &s;he's got the <HI>&s;taggers.</HI> You <HI>lie,</HI> you &s;coundrel, &s;aid the lady. The coachman knocked at the door, and I was conducted, by a footman, to the family of my cou&s;in. Drunk! &s;aid I to my&s;elf, as I pa&s;&s;ed through the hall, and a&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e&mdash;<HI>drunk!</HI> a well-dre&s;&s;ed wo|man, drunk in the public &s;treet, at this time of the night, and u&s;ing &s;uch language too, becau&s;e a man civilly in|quires what's the matter with her? Me|thinks the London ladies are a little
<PB N="12" REF="27">queeri&s;h: Lord help me, I &s;ee, I know no more of the ways of this world yet, than a &s;ucking pig. Courage, Be|nignus&mdash;<HI>that world,</HI> is "all before you."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L.</HEAD>
<P>I was &s;o extremely fatigued with my journey, from never having tra|velled &s;o far, or &s;o long together be|fore, that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king permi&s;&s;ion to withdraw to my apartments &s;oon after I had paid, and received, the cu&s;tomary compli|ments. Aukward matters to be &s;ure, <HI>fir&s;t &s;alutations</HI> are at be&s;t, but to a fellow who has not yet rubbed off the ba&s;h|fulne&s;s of a boy, by mixing with men, they are horribly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. I do not know that ever I felt a more di&s;plea&s;|ing &s;en&s;ation than at my entrance in|to

<P>In &s;omething le&s;s than a quarter of an hour after the tea-things were removed, a young fellow of a florid complexion, with his hair curling in his neck, came to inform me Mr. Abrahams would wait upon me in five &s;econds. Mr. Abrahams, was, it &s;eems, the &s;teward of Mrs. Darling|ton's e&s;tates, and had great &s;hare al&s;o in the management of her <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> affairs; and my cou&s;in, willing to re|commodate
<PB N="39" REF="54">me in the be&s;t manner, went out her&s;elf to order the &s;aid <HI>&s;teward,</HI> rather than a common menial adherent, to attend me. At the time this me&s;&s;age was brought me, Alicia and I were looking over the books, with the <HI>titles</HI> of every one of which (numerous as they were) &s;he appeared to be acquainted; &s;he peru&s;ed the <HI>bearer</HI> of this me&s;&s;age, as accurately as po&s;&s;ible, the moment he entered; and indeed he was a very proper &s;ubject for <HI>female critici&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Benjamin &mdash; for Benjamin it was,&mdash;was the <HI>nephew</HI> of this Mr. Abrahams&mdash;the footman <HI>out of livery</HI> to Mrs. Darlington&mdash;and the <HI>favourite</HI> of Mrs. Darlington's <HI>niece.</HI> He was now habited in a light green coat and wai&s;tcoat, neat buck-&s;kin breeches,
<PB N="40" REF="55">brown thread &s;tockings, a ruffled &s;hirt, &s;hining &s;hoes, and &s;ilver-buckles. Nor were <HI>other</HI> nece&s;&s;ary appendages wanting; &s;uch as an hazle &s;witch, headed with a piece of ivory, in his hand; a cravat, which, with a narrow edging, and tied carele&s;sly, adorned his neck&mdash;a garnet brea&s;t-buckle in the form of a heart, and a bunch of baubles depending from his watch; in a word, he might very well have pa&s;&s;ed for a young nobleman, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, gravitating towards the ken|nel and the &s;table, had ju&s;t come to London for the <HI>day,</HI> on purpo&s;e to have the plea&s;ure of riding home <HI>to|morrow;</HI> chiefly indeed for the &s;u|preme exploit of telling his acquain|tances how many &s;core of miles he can ride betwixt <HI>&s;un-ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;un-&s;et.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="56">As Alicia &s;eemed to pay &s;ome &s;ort of re&s;pect to him, I inclined my head, at his entrance, rather nearer the earth than was nece&s;&s;ary; or indeed, to &s;peak more properly, I was rather more <HI>polite</HI> than the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of &s;u|bordination pre&s;cribe: for, having nothing about his dre&s;s that marked his real &s;tation (except a broad fringe of &s;ilver that &s;urrounded the button of his hat, which I did not directly take notice of, the hat being then under his arm), he might as ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for my lord <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as my lord's <HI>favourite jockey.</HI> Mr. Benjamin was, however, I find my <HI>lady's</HI> gentle|man; and a &s;mart, <HI>tight, taking</HI> lad he was, as ever came a volunteer into the honourable &s;ervice.

<P>Di&mdash;<HI>rectly,</HI> would have been pro|nounced, had not the two la&s;t &s;ylla|bles of that word, been cut off, by the appearance of Mr. Abrahams him|&s;elf. This &s;erious per&s;onage was al|together different, both in look
<PB N="44" REF="59">and dre&s;s, from his nephew Mr. Ben|jamin; being rather &s;warthy, than fair, and formal than &s;pruce.&mdash;Now then, young &s;ir, if you plea&s;e, &s;aid he, not much in the tone of a dome&s;|tic&mdash;now, let us <HI>make hay, while</HI> &s;he &s;un &s;hines,&mdash;with all my heart Mr. Abrahams, I replied, for we are &s;ome|thing late. Better late than never, &s;aid the &s;teward&mdash;mi&s;s Alicia your humble &s;ervant; Benjamin, I under|&s;tand from my lady, thee art to follow us. Ben bowed, Alicia curtified. Abrahams bent his neck, as if he hated compliment, (that is to <HI>pay</HI> it) and I, went &s;craping like a &s;chool-boy, out of the room.</P>
<P>And now it was that the expre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Greaves became forcibly ex|empli&s;ied; for, "curio&s;ity indeed,
<PB N="45" REF="60">paid the debt to &s;urrounding &s;plen|dour;" my eyes and heart were im|mediately taken captive, and led, not unwillingly, in the plea&s;ing chains of inexhau&s;ted novelty. I walked amid the ambition of buildings, and the clatter of carriages, as if under en|chantment; and at the entrance of the Mall (which was on that day, crouded with company), I did not think that the paradi&s;e of Mahomet could be more elegantly di&s;played: for here, beauty, wealth, and elegance, were on all &s;ides exhibited, and what chiefly plea&s;ed me, was the appearance of <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> that crowned the whole. The dre&s;s and di&s;cour&s;e of every party might be various, but <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> &s;eemed to be uniform: an ill tempered man would here have lo&s;t his errand, and
<PB N="46" REF="61">gone home di&s;appointed: the ladies were &s;pringhtly, and &s;miling; the gen|tlemen were a&s;&s;able, and ga&s;tant: youth and age appeared equally to be delighted, and my heart &s;o tym|pathized and expanded, at the view of &s;o many hundreds of my fellow|creatures &s;ocial and agreeable, that I could not help catching Mr. Abrahams by the hand, and in the genuine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|fu&s;ions of tran&s;port, exclaiming&punc; Heaven and earth! my dear &s;ir, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a <HI>joyful pro&s;pect,</HI> is this!

Mercy upon us! &s;aid Benjamin, lifting up his hands! &mdash; mercy upon us! Heigho! &s;ighed I&mdash;who would think it? Ah! ha! cried Benjamin &s;oftly, yet with &s;ome emotion, there &s;he is, by gingo! &mdash; Here he plucked me gently by the &s;leeve, a&s;king me, in a whi&s;per, if I took notice of a young woman on one of the benches, and if I did not think &s;he was the <HI>mo&s;t land&s;ome&s;t</HI> creature I had ever &s;een,
<PB N="48" REF="63">&s;ince I had eyes in my head: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> latter part of this que&s;tion, was ut|tered rather warmly, &s;o that before I had time to an&s;wer it, Abraham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> turned about, and Benjamin (who all along kept aweful di&s;tance) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> behind.

<PB N="49" REF="64">has got &s;ix &s;ons&mdash;mu&s;t come all to the pari&s;h&mdash;and is, at this very time, in treaty with an <HI>hone&s;t man,</HI> who has &s;aved up a tri&s;le by indu&s;try, to &s;up|ply him with a cool thou&s;and upon the <HI>la&s;t</HI> mortgage. And &s;o then, (thought I) well-bred per&s;ons it &s;eems, are the <HI>mo&s;t obedient</HI> and <HI>eternally devoted &s;ervants</HI> of the <HI>errante&s;t ra&s;cal</HI> in the three kingdoms; and to &s;hew their politene&s;s the more eminently, will even &s;hake this <HI>identical ra&s;cal</HI> by the hand, with the &s;ame cordiality, that they would embrace a very hone&s;t fellow.</P>
<P>By this time we had got to the top of the Park, and having now had a view of the <HI>gayer</HI> parts of the town, I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to walk rather into &s;ome of the &s;treets of bu&s;ine&s;s, than into the gloom of We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey:
<PB N="50" REF="65">A wi&s;h which the &s;teward gladly obeyed, ob&s;erving that, <HI>trade was the thing,</HI> and that every other point upon earth was tra&s;h and fla&s;h, and flum|mery, and non&s;en&s;e, and nothing at all. Benjamin &s;eemed much to wi&s;h we would take another turn down the Mall, but perceiving his uncle again&s;t it, dared not he&s;itate; though I could plainly perceive the poor lad's heart was upon one of the benches.</P>
<P>Accordingly we plunged into the great &s;cenes of bu&s;ine&s;s, and had no &s;ooner got within Temple-bar, than the contra&s;t became &s;o vi&s;ible, that the building appeared to be the boun|dary of a <HI>different world,</HI> inhabited by a different race of mortals. A &s;tep of di&s;patch, an eye of attention, and
<PB N="51" REF="66">a face of care, di&s;tingui&s;hed almo&s;t all we <HI>met,</HI> from almo&s;t all we had <HI>left.</HI> If one neighbour met another, he took him ha&s;tily by the hand, nodded his head, and pre&s;&s;ed eagerly forward: whereas, on the contrary, I ob&s;erved parties in the Park, &s;aunter indolently along, or form them&s;elves into little &s;ocieties, and &s;ometimes hold a long conver&s;ation. <HI>Here</HI> al&s;o, the <HI>bea&s;t,</HI> &s;eemed to &s;hare the impatience of the <HI>man;</HI> the very hor&s;es, as if animated by the general hurry, were either vigorou&s;ly toiling in the car, or bound|ing along with the coach: even <HI>death</HI> was di&s;regarded; and the hear&s;es rolled be&s;ide us with all the &s;pright|line&s;s of bridal chariots; nay, I beheld a fellow running a-cro&s;s the way, with a <HI>co&s;&s;in</HI> over his &s;houlder; and heard
<PB N="52" REF="67">him at the &s;ame time <HI>cur&s;e</HI> a &s;cavenger, who ob&s;tructed his way.</P>
<P>Abrahams jogged on with the ut|mo&s;t indifference, except that now and then, he &s;aid, he wi&s;hed Mrs. Dar|lington lived <HI>in the city,</HI> and that he thought Thames-&s;treet infinitely preferable to all the jumble of St. James's. At la&s;t he di&s;patched Ben|jamin with an errand, fir&s;t a&s;king my permi&s;&s;ion. The errand luckily hap|pened to lie at Charing-cro&s;s; and Benjamin, either out of affection he bore his uncle, or &s;ome <HI>other</HI> per&s;on, ran forward as fa&s;t as his legs could carry him. I now took a peep into the <HI>&s;hops,</HI> in every window of which was di&s;played a moderate fortune. Every thing that could give ta&s;te to attracting trifles, or decorations to
<PB N="53" REF="68">that which was actually nece&s;&s;ary; all that could accommodate the <HI>per&s;on</HI> with convenience, with lu&s;tre, and with magnificence, lay open to the eye. The agreeable and glittering temptations were indeed &s;o artfully <HI>di&s;po&s;ed,</HI> and &s;o &s;kilfully had Invention varied her trinkets, that the pa&s;&s;enger was irre&s;i&s;tibly invited to lay out his money; and yet Abrahams, &s;eldom turned his head, even to look at them. I was much captivated by the gla&s;s-ca&s;e of a jeweller, when, &s;topping to look over the &s;plendid toys which it contained, I a&s;ked the &s;teward if he was not amazed to &s;ee &s;o many pretty, &s;hewy contrivances? Not at all amazed, an&s;wered he, &s;ir, to <HI>&s;ee</HI> them, but very <HI>much</HI> amazed to think there are any people weak and <HI>ig|noramus</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="69">enough to buy them; but, as I always &s;aid, a fool and his money is &s;oon parted. There was a little box however, which particularly plea&s;ed me, and which I was re&s;olved to purcha&s;e, in defiance of all the pro|verbs of Solomon or Abrahams; I went into the &s;hop, while Abrahams, &s;tood grinning at the door, as much as to &s;ay, he did not like the bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The trader was one of the neate&s;t, be&s;t &s;poken, obliging beings that ever hopped round a counter; his face was exceed|ing pale, and made &s;till paler by the powder on his pate, which was rather flat than oval, but there was a gaiety in his eyes (even though they were grey), which compen&s;ated for &s;ome|thing of deadne&s;s, in the re&s;t of his
<PB N="55" REF="70">countenance. He drew out the gla&s;s adroitly, and gave me, with flippant a&s;&s;ability, the hi&s;tory and intent of every bauble. I was really quite taken with the man's <HI>polite&s;&s;e;</HI> and though I had no &s;ort of intention to buy more than the little box, yet he &s;o clearly proved to me the indi&s;pen|&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e of &s;everal ar|ticles, of which I never before had an idea, or indeed knew that the world contained in it any &s;uch arti|ticles, that, in le&s;s than twenty mi|nutes, this courteous jeweller ab&s;o|lutely talked me out of &s;even guineas and a half. I made purcha&s;e of a &s;hining chain for my watch, which the trader prote&s;ted was the mo&s;t <HI>delicate workman&s;hip in the three kingdoms</HI> &mdash;I bought two cry&s;tal &s;eals, becau&s;e
<PB N="56" REF="71">he very properly ob&s;erved, that a <HI>good chain</HI> ought to have <HI>hand&s;ome ap|pendages,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as a good hou&s;e ought to have hand&s;ome furni|ture. I bought a &s;ilver tooth-pick ca&s;e, becau&s;e he &s;aid no gentleman was without one, and, be&s;ides, they looked <HI>mighty pretty</HI> in the hand after dinner: the&s;e, with my box, completed my marketings, with which I departed, and as I went out of the door, in|formed Mr. Abrahams (with &s;ome|what of triumph in the tone of my voice) of my bargain, a&s;king him at the &s;ame time, if he did not think I had them <HI>a pennyworth?</HI></P>
<P>A pennyworth, &s;ir!&mdash;cried the &s;te|ward, (&s;neering up his upper-lip, till it touched the tip of his no&s;e, and twitching up the wai&s;tband of his

<P>There are &s;everal places in this me|tropolis, (and indeed all over this king|dom,) particularly adapted to cheri&s;h idlene&s;s. A book&s;eller's, a barber's, a chandler's, and a milliner's; and the&s;e, both in London and in the country, are immemorially famous for &s;helter|ing tho&s;e people who have little <HI>to do,</HI> and an infinite deal to &s;ay. Hence we con&s;tantly find them &s;illed and fre|quented by indolents of all denomina|tions. Included in the catalogue, are half-pay officers, gentlemen who live, as they term it, on their means, gen|tlemen who live upon <HI>ways,</HI> without any <HI>means</HI> at all; ladies who &s;et the
<PB N="66" REF="81">fa&s;hions, ladies who <HI>follow</HI> the fa&s;hions, and ladies who only love to <HI>&s;ee</HI> and <HI>talk about</HI> fa&s;hions, without any power to do more than hobble in the train, at an humble, imitative di&s;tance: the&s;e are peculiar to the connections of the milliner. The barber and the chandler, for the vulgar; and the book&s;eller, for the lazy, the learned, and the laborious.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal of this kind of cu&s;tomers in the &s;hop when I went in and two or three people <HI>really</HI> mak|ing purcha&s;es. Seeing bu&s;ine&s;s on foot, and a chair empty, I &s;at down, and ran my eye over a pamphlet that laid upon the counter. Pray Mr. Luton, &s;aid one of the cu&s;tomers, holding a book in his hand, does this <HI>do any thing?</HI> Why not much, &s;ir, it
<PB N="67" REF="82"><HI>moves but &s;lowly.</HI> Aye, aye, <HI>fe&s;tina lente,</HI> &s;aid the other&mdash;the fellow has a pretty knack at <HI>novels,</HI> I think.

He is dull, &s;ir, devili&s;h dull, dull as orthodoxy.

<P>Well, and what <HI>&s;aid</HI> he, cried the buyer, preparing to go out? <HI>Said</HI> he, rejoined Mr. Luton, &s;ternly, why he &s;aid nothing. I might as well have endeavoured to drive an hackney be|yond his hou&s;e of call, as that mule of a fellow out of his track. No, &s;ir, no: he wrote ob&s;tinately on, &s;tring|ing together his damned collection of morals, into four volumes 8vo. and preachifying, till he <HI>piou&s;ly picked my pocket</HI> of above a hundred and fifty guineas; be&s;ides the twenty, (here he caught the gentleman by the wri&s;t,) I generally gave him for the copy be|fore the fir&s;t volume was worked off. But, heaven be prai&s;ed, I have wa&s;hed my hands of him, and &s;o he and his

Here, here's a little fellow now (taking a book from a &s;helf behind him) here's a lad knows how to tickle up the town to a tittle: knows how to &s;ed the pul&s;e of the public to a nicety. Lookec, &s;ir, pointing to the title page, fifth edition, with addition, and <HI>came out</HI> only the beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the winter &mdash; every thing he writes runs like wildfire.

Good morrow to you, &s;aid the gentleman, and went out. He now &s;erved other people, and they going away likewi&s;e, I was ju&s;t ri&s;ing from my chair to conver&s;e with Mr. Luton, when a tall, &s;pare, figure came &s;talking into the &s;hop, taking out of his bo&s;om a large packet, and pre&s;enting it to the book|feller. There is volume the fir&s;t, cried the &s;pectre. In God's name, Mr. Le|muel, &s;aid Luton, (ca&s;ting his eye at a cha&s;m in his breeches, which I believe might originally have been whitei&s;h,)
<PB N="72" REF="87">why do you come out in the day-time? You know the credit of me and my &s;hop, and every body knows your trade in a twinkle. This was delivered in a &s;ort of half-whi&s;per, articulating as it were grinningly, through the teeth. Sir, &s;aid the author (for &s;uch he was) I was driven into this &s;tep, by a pre|cipitate and particular nece&s;&s;ity; for my landlord begins to mention the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of arrears and rent to me, and therefore you will advance me the price of <HI>this</HI>&mdash;laying his fable palm upon the parcel&mdash;di|rectly, becau&s;e the remarks of mine ho&s;t are not only pathetic, but have therewith a tincture of the terrible. What before the <HI>proofs</HI> are corrected, cried Luton? That's out of the re|gular channel, you know, Mr. Le|muel;
<PB N="73" REF="88">but, as a matter of indulgence, and in con&s;ideration of that aperture in your breeches, I will come down half a guinea, and tru&s;t to your honour to go on with the &s;ame care, as if you had not received a farthing. Men of letters <HI>ought</HI> to be &s;ometimes encouraged; and as I really believe you have a little out-run the con&s;table in the purcha&s;e of that la&s;t pair of &s;hoes, I can't refu&s;e you: there, &s;ir. He told out ten &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, from a pur&s;e which appeared to contain about &s;ixty pounds, and the petitioner (after having given a writ|ten acknowledgment for the &s;um) took it up, made his bow, and walked away, without any di&s;agreeable &s;enti|ment whatever. He was &s;carce gone, then another per&s;on, in a full trimmed
<PB N="74" REF="89">&s;uit of black velvet, came &s;tintting into the &s;hop, with a look, tread, and tone of great authority. Luton, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t let me have three hun|dred to-morrow: the Hi&s;tory will make eight quarto volumes, and I will not take &s;ix pence le&s;s than 150i. each. Really, &s;ir, &s;aid Luton, you put me to a <HI>nonplu&s;h,</HI> I am quite out of ca&s;h&mdash;have a <HI>large &s;um to make up</HI> for my printer again&s;t the beginning of the weck&mdash;I wi&s;h therefore&mdash;A fig for your wi&s;hes, &s;ir, replied the de|mandant, (elevating his head, and ex|panding his che&s;t,) &s;hall I have the money?&mdash;What time will you call in the city, &s;ir, an&s;wered Luton, &s;neak|ingly&mdash;<HI>I</HI> call in the city, Mr. Lucon &mdash;What do you mean by that? A con&s;lagration con&s;ume the city&mdash;Who's
<PB N="75" REF="90">to run after you, hey? I have a hou&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e, yes, and in a Square, and I pre&s;ume you know too, that there is a certain brazen intelligencer upon the door, and I expect you by eleven o'clock. I &s;ay no more,&mdash;but I expect, d&mdash;m&mdash;e I expect you! So &s;aying, he turned upon his heel, threw his body of literature into a carriage, which was waiting for him at the door, and left Luton to meditate up|on the three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I now ro&s;e a &s;econd time, and de|fired to &s;ee the Magazines for the month: while I was turning over the&s;e, Abrahams came in, begging me ten thou&s;and pardons, and mo&s;t bit|terly complaining that he had been groping almo&s;t upon his hands and knees this hour, to no manner of pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="76" REF="91">for he could &s;ee no &s;igns of his property; and that, hard as it was, he mu&s;t e'en put up with the lo&s;s; and was ready to attend me to din|ner. I propo&s;ed going back in a coach, to which Mr. Abrahams, con|fe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf heartily tired (and knowing po&s;&s;ibly that there would be no great matter for <HI>him</HI> to pay) rea|dily con&s;ented. I purcha&s;ed a pam|phlet, a coach was called, and we &s;et off for Mrs. Darlington's.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LV.</HEAD>
<P>About the middle of Fleet-&s;treet, Abrahams happened to ca&s;t his eye upon the &s;hop of a &s;ilver&s;mith; and
<PB N="77" REF="92">this bringing &s;trongly to mind the misfortune of his buckle, he cried out with &s;ome emotion, what a pretty morning's work have I made of it, in|deed; yes, yes, fine misfortunes, in|deed&mdash;a buckle too, that I have had &s;o long, and a buckle of &s;ilver into the bargain, and a buckle that might have been in the &s;hoe of my Benjamin, when I am laid low in my grave!&mdash;Stop coachman, &s;top, &s;aid I, &s;et us down here a minute. I took the unhappy &s;teward by the hand, and walked with him into the &s;hop. If I thought I could match it now, &s;aid Abrahams, as he pa&s;&s;ed towards the door, I would certainly be extravagant for once; though I believe I have a pair of re|&s;pectable metal buckles in the hou&s;e too: he could, however: find no fel|low
<PB N="78" REF="93">to that which was on his foot; and truly, its fellow would not very ea&s;ily have been found in any &s;hop within the liberties of London: for be&s;ides that it was in fa&s;hion thirteen years ago, it was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;mall and thin, with the wear and tear of &s;o many hard winters, that I appre|hend a &s;ilver groat would have turned the &s;cale, and fairly out-valued it</P>
<P>Not being able, therefore, to pro|vide a companion for the old one, he thought of <HI>bartering</HI> with it for a &s;e|cond hand pair; and to this purpo&s;e he unbuckled, laid the &s;olitary &s;er|vant upon the counter, and de&s;ired to know what it was worth, or rather, what he could allow him in the ex|change, &s;hould he choo&s;e to become a purcha&s;er. As much as any body
<PB N="79" REF="94">in the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ir, &s;aid the &s;ilver|&s;mith, and while I determine its va|lue, perhaps, if you look over the drawer on the other &s;ide, you may fuit your&s;elf; and depend upon it, you are come <HI>to the cheape&s;t &s;hop in own.</HI> We examined a variety of &s;hewy goods, to all of which Mr. Abrahams, the &s;teward, had but <HI>one</HI> objection, viz. that he was morally sure the fellow would a&s;k three times more than, as an hone&s;t man, he ought; for, &s;ir, &s;ays he, drawing up his jaws &s;ignificantly, there is no gue&s;&s;ing at the value of a buckle, while the&s;e heavy tongs and an|chors are in them. Meantime the &s;il|ver&s;mith was employed, at the oppo|&s;ite counter, in weighing the old buckle, which he pre&s;ently informed
<PB N="80" REF="95">us came to &s;eventeen pence half|penny. Seventeen pence halfpenny! cried the &s;teward, (turning &s;hort a|bout, and twitching the fore-top of his wig;) why man, the pair co&s;t me nine &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, and they are as good as new. There is a great difference betwixt buying and &s;elling, you know &s;ir, ob&s;erved the trader, and there is nobody <HI>now</HI> will put &s;uch a thing as this (turning the anchor backwards and forwards) upon the foot. Won't they? Why not pray, &s;aid Abrahams, while the colour came flu&s;hing over his cheek-bone&mdash;Why not, hey? It don't &s;ignify di&s;pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ir, about &s;uch a tri&s;le, of which I have offered you the full value, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> joined the trader; and if you have a mind to take the money, there it is&punc;
<PB N="81" REF="96">if not you are welcome to the trouble you have given me, and your buckle into the bargain. I am, <HI>am</HI> I! What, after you have bruis'd the anchors all to pieces, hey? replied Abrahams. I thank you for your love, but I am a man that knows the world; an odd old bird, that knows wheat from chaff. I'll have my buckle, exactly as I gave it you, &s;ir. What a devil bu&s;ine&s;s had you to mangle my property in this manner&mdash;in this way? He ran on for &s;everal minutes, and at la&s;t a&s;k'd, in a growling voice, what would be the lowe&s;t price of the pair hanging over the window? Why, &s;aid the &s;ilver|&s;mith, they are only plated, were made many ages ago, and being old &s;tyle, will come cheap. <HI>Plated,</HI> &s;neer'd Abrahams with ineffable contempt;
<PB N="82" REF="97">then, I &s;uppo&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;eventeen, you would not give me &s;even pence, if I &s;hould choo&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of them a twelvemonth hence? No, nor &s;even farthings neither, &s;aid the trade&s;man, returning his &s;neer. Thou art a very &s;aucy fellow, rejoin'd the &s;teward, and I would go with my &s;hoe-&s;traps about my heels to eternity, before I would buy a pair of thee. As you plea&s;e, &s;ir, &s;aid the &s;mith; and, to tell you the truth, I don't care how few of &s;uch cu&s;tomers I have to my back. Abra|hams was huddling up his broken &s;ilver (not forgetting the iron thereun|to belonging), and was bu&s;tling away in high dudgeon, when I begg'd him to &s;top a moment. No, &s;ir, an&s;wer'd he; no, &s;ir, I will wait for you in the coach, but I will not &s;tay another
<PB N="83" REF="98">&s;econd in this &s;hop, for all the <HI>&s;ur|li&s;h'd up &s;tuff</HI> it contains: &s;o &s;aying, he went out grumbling and grinning in a mo&s;t violent manner.</P>
<P>I now rewarded the pains of the &s;ilver&s;mith, by purcha&s;ing a pair of near and new &s;ilver buckles, received his thanks, with my goods, nicely wrapped up in a piece of paper, and went forthwith to the coach. I had not got my foot upon the &s;tep, before I heard Abrahams &s;everely chiding a woman who had been &s;weeping the cro&s;tway with a be&s;om, for having the impudence to de&s;ire alms, when the had &s;o good a trade in her hands; and when I do not doubt, &s;aid he, but you have extorted more money from pa&s;&s;engers this very morning,
<PB N="84" REF="99">than would make good the lo&s;s of the &s;ilver buckle which I lo&s;t in St. Paul's Church-Yard. Indeed, &s;ir, cried the woman, I have not taken but one halfpenny to day, though half a thou|&s;and folks have <HI>gone over my cre&s;&s;ing</HI> without du&s;ting their &s;hoes, and that one was flirted at me by a young man who wanted to &s;ee if he could not hit the old woman on the head, by &s;end|ing a halfpenny as he would play at taw, and &s;o, wantonly&mdash;God ble&s;s him &mdash;jerkt it at me from his finger and thumb, in this manner; and after all, &s;ir, lookee, it is but a <HI>Brum.</HI> Do, therefore, dear, good &s;ir, for charity's &s;ake.&mdash;Charity, my b&mdash;k&mdash;de, &s;aid Abrahams, pr'ythee woman don't be trouble&s;ome, go civilly away, for I won't give thee a <HI>&s;ous,</HI> Coachman,
<PB N="85" REF="100">drive on; &s;aying this, he drew up di&s;dainfully one of the gla&s;&s;es. The poor woman really looks faint, and, I think, Mr. Abrahams, &s;aid I, we &s;hould &s;o far oblige her, as to throw her a little copper; and then, letting down the gla&s;s, I gave her two-pence. &mdash;As you like, exclaimed old Good Works, as you like: <HI>I</HI> have lo&s;t enough, &s;ir, for one morning already. The coach now proceeded, and Abrahams &s;at &s;ullenly &s;welling in one corner, leaning his arm again&s;t the left pannel, chagrin'd much at the buckle, but more, at what he call'd the &s;aucine&s;s of the <HI>&s;eller</HI> of buckles. When I had &s;een Mr. Abrahams exhibit his temper thus far, I was re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring him about a little, before I re|&s;ign'd him over to melancholy reflec|tions
<PB N="86" REF="101">in his counting-hou&s;e: and, in this manner, I began to admini&s;ter a &s;alve for all his &s;ores. Mr. Abrahams, I think my&s;elf much obliged to you for your company in my rambles of the morning; but I cannot without concern reflect, that in procuring me this plea&s;ure, it has been productive of <HI>your</HI> inconvenience; and, as it has &s;o fallen out, I mu&s;t in &s;ome degree in&s;i&s;t upon repairing it. The werd <HI>repairing,</HI> like &s;udden &s;un&s;hine in &s;tormy weather, work'd wonders up|on the features of Abrahams, which, from the gloom of wrathful wrinkles, became &s;often'd into the mo&s;t &s;miling &s;ymptoms of complacence; and when I put the paper which contain'd the buckles into his hand (re-in&s;i&s;ting up|on his acceptance as a <HI>debt</HI> due to him
<PB N="87" REF="102">for his <HI>civility),</HI> he only affected to re|fu&s;e, that I might pre&s;s them the more eagerly upon him, and &s;o give him a better opportunity to receive them, without exciting in my brea&s;t any &s;entiment to his di&s;advantage; for Mr. Abrahams was a great ob&s;erver of forms; and, although he was at the bottom as &s;elfi&s;h a mortal as could po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, yet he took great care, in general, to &s;ave appearances, and without, in reality, ever doing a &s;ingle prai&s;e-worthy action, was ge|nerally talk'd of as a very <HI>religious, knowing, well-meaning, good kind</HI> of a man. He took the buckles, and &s;o well contriv'd it, as to &s;ix the obligation on my &s;ide; for, as he put them into his pocket, he very gravely a&s;&s;ured me, that rather than <HI>affront</HI> me by a
<PB N="88" REF="103">denial, &s;uch was his <HI>regard,</HI> he would wear the buckles, even though they came from the &s;hop of the mo&s;t &s;coun|dreally &s;ilver&s;mith in the city of Lon|don.</P>
<P>Thus was good-humour re&s;tor'd to the &s;teward, who chuckled and chat|ted all the re&s;t of the way; and when we arrived at Mrs. Darlington's, he jumpt out of the coach with the bri&s;k|ne&s;s of a boy, and handed me ob&s;e|quiou&s;ly into the hall.&mdash;We had for|got to pay the coachman, and I &s;aw the &s;teward in a dilemma&mdash;he fumbled in his pockets &s;ome time, then pro|ducing a guinea, a&s;k'd, with a trem|bling voice, for change, though I could plainly &s;ee how much his ava|rice was alarmed le&s;t the driver &s;hould happen to have &s;o much &s;ilver about
<PB N="89" REF="104">him. I relieved his di&s;tre&s;s, by &s;ati&s;|fying the fare, while the good man was making many excu&s;es for giving me &s;o much trouble, and lamenting his want of loo&s;e &s;ilver, which, he pro|to&s;ted, for the future, he would al|ways carry in his pocket.</P>

<P>The dinner was &s;erving up as I en|ter'd the dining-parlour, where I was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than I related the adventures of the morning, conceal|ing only the pre&s;ent of the buckles. The ladies were highly entertained by the narrative, and Mi&s;s Alicia was particularly &s;mart in her remarks,
<PB N="90" REF="105">till I came to animadvert on the be|haviour of Benjamin.

I was now, therefore, left alone to the en|joyment of my reflections; and the&s;e &s;oon brought on, &s;oliloquy the &s;econd. Why, friend Benignus, this is a brave
<PB N="93" REF="108"><HI>&s;etting out!</HI> A noble exploit truly!&mdash; Thou ha&s;t &s;poilt a very excellent din|ner, and &s;ent the founders of the fea&s;t weeping away.

The whole matter too, may po&s;&s;ibly, be a weak &s;urmi&s;e. How then have I had the a&s;&s;urance to make the &s;tory out my own way?</P>
<P>Mrs. Darlington now returned, ob|&s;erving that her niece had de&s;ired to be left alone a little, and politely made her apologies for leaving me &s;o abruptly. All this was poi&s;on to my wound. I was fully con&s;cious of the little trick I had played. The pang of reproach &s;truck my heart, and the
<PB N="94" REF="109">tear of contrition was &s;wimming round my eye. I declined cating, on pretence of fatigue, and Mrs. Dar|lington &s;wallow'd a &s;poonful of &s;oup, and withdrew again to her Alicia. I &s;pent the interval betwixt this meal and tea, in a &s;en&s;e of real agony, ari&s;|ing from the conviction of real mean|ne&s;s and error. My feelings were, as yet, unblunted by habitual tre&s;pa&s;&s;es; and, as my greate&s;t joy aro&s;e from the contemplation of having contri|buted &s;omething to the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of others; &s;o my greate&s;t anxiety aro&s;e from an idea of having promoted their <HI>mi&s;ery.</HI> Yet, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, no way was left open for me to rectify my mi&s;take, or to &s;often the unca&s;i|ne&s;s which my blunder had brought about; for all explanations would
<PB N="95" REF="110">have betrayed that I gue&s;&s;ed at Alicia's di&s;order; and I could not &s;o much as hope admittance to her apartment, had explanation been advi&s;eable. At tea, however, the young lady made her appearance, led tenderly into the room by her aunt, and I was glad to &s;ee her attempting to re&s;ume her for|mer &s;pirits; of which, in the general, &s;he had, as the reader may po&s;&s;ibly re|collect, an abundant &s;hare. But, right|well &s;ung the Bard, who fir&s;t ob&s;erv|ed, that misfortunes <Q>love to clu&s;|ter,</Q> and &s;eldom or never come &s;ingly. Indeed, <HI>one</HI> is commonly the ill-favour'd me&s;&s;enger of <HI>another,</HI> and that of a <HI>third,</HI> and <HI>&s;o on</HI> to the end of the la&s;t dreadful chapter of human ac|cidents. This was a day of di&s;a&s;ters to poor Alicia. Mrs. Darlington had
<PB N="96" REF="111">ju&s;t pour'd out the fir&s;t cup of tea&punc; and was affectionately pre&s;&s;ing her niece to drink it, when a violent noi&s;e was heard in the hall, and a con&s;us'd cry of &s;everal voices, as if deploring a misfortune. Pre&s;ently afterwards a &s;ervant came into the parlour, and with him Mr. Abrahams, acquainting the ladies, that Benjamin, who had been mi&s;&s;ing at dinner, was now co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in all over blood and brui&s;es, and that the &s;ervants were carrying him up to bed &s;peechle&s;s.</P>
<P>Blood was no &s;ooner pronounced than the tea-cup fell from the hand of Alicia to the ground; on which, in the &s;ame moment, &s;he &s;unk down her|&s;elf. This Mrs. Darlington imputed to the effects of a &s;udden &s;urprize &s;eiz|ing her &s;o &s;oon after her late agitation:
<PB N="97" REF="112">while I was, perhaps, the only one pre&s;ent who attributed it to the true cau&s;e: every method was u&s;ed to re|cover her, but the violence of the &s;its into which &s;he now fell, re&s;i&s;ted our utmo&s;t endeavours, and &s;he was a &s;e|cond time conveyed to her chamber, in a much more alarming connition than before. Mr. Abrahams and I now went up to Benjamin, to &s;ee if he was yet able to unfold the occa&s;ion of this my&s;tery; when Abrahams, ere he had well opened the door, and con|&s;equently before he knew whether his nephew was dead or alive, began to harangue as follows.</P>
<P>What is bred in the bone, will never come out of the fle&s;h! You cannot make a &s;ilk pur&s;e of a &s;ow's ear! Pray, &s;ir, in God's holy name,

<P>The&s;e que&s;tions were all thundered upon the poor lad at once, and, in the uttering them, &s;uch was the rage of the &s;teward, that he not only com|mitted the extravagance of &s;triking a pen, which he had then in his hand, again&s;t the table, but &s;mote that

<P>All this time lay the agonized Ben|jamin, re&s;igned as a lamb, under the knife of the butcher; and when the fervants had wa&s;hed him, and, at my de&s;ire departed, I &s;at by his bed-&s;ide, and gently &s;ollicited to learn the cau&s;e of this &s;trange di&s;a&s;ter.</P>

<P><PB N="101" REF="116">You remember, &s;ir, how I bid you take notice of a young girl, &s;itting alone on one of the Park benches (&s;he is not a bad girl, I can a&s;&s;ure you, though &s;he was &s;itting by her&s;elf.)

The poor fellow's heart was &s;o &s;oft|ened by this indulgence, and &s;o af|fected by the other circum&s;tances which were lying heavily upon it, that he could not return his acknow|ledgments.

<P>In truth, this Benjamin was a mo&s;t excellent di&s;po&s;ed young man, his

<P>She was &s;ent out ye&s;terday morning to the baker's, over the way, to get change for half a guinea, but not being able to get it there, &s;eeing as how they had not &s;o much &s;ilver in the hou&s;e, &s;he went to &s;everal other neighbours &s;hops, and at la&s;t to the chandler's; and there &s;he met with a man, who offered to go to his brother's, as he called him,

<P>As &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed the man was as hone&s;t as her&s;elf, (and I'm &s;ure &s;he is as hone&s;t as Heaven&mdash;) &s;he gave him the half guinea, and &s;at down in the &s;hop to wait his return.

<PB N="113" REF="128">come into the hou&s;e again, and was going into it him&s;elf. Ju&s;t as he had unlocked the &s;treet-door, he a&s;ked her for the money, &s;aying he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had &s;pent it,&mdash;with a great oath; and when &s;he told him the truth, he damned her in a terrible manner, banged to the door, and left her to go where &s;he might. She &s;at all night crying upon the thre&s;hold, till at la&s;t a watchman, who knew her, took pity on her, put her to bed to <HI>his</HI> wife, and then went again to his bu|&s;ine&s;s. In the morning &s;he went home a &s;econd time; but when her father opened the &s;hutters, and the poor thing a&s;ked him, if &s;he &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of making the fire, and getting his breakfa&s;t, as u&s;ual, he or|dered her to get away from the door,
<PB N="114" REF="129">or el&s;e he would &s;end a con&s;table to her.</P>
<P>The next thing &s;he did, was to find me out, for you mu&s;t know, &s;ir, we have&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> for one an|other:&mdash;but as &s;he knew what a jea|lous creature my uncle is, &s;he was too good to come near my mi&s;trets's hou&s;e; becau&s;e, I once invited her there, to drink tea with Mrs. Goodly the hou&s;e-keeper, and I thought I never &s;hould hear the la&s;t of it.

Be&s;ides, &s;he knew I was flurried enough at meeting her there, and would contrive to &s;ee her as &s;oon
<PB N="116" REF="131">as po&s;&s;ible.

<PB N="117" REF="132">and water, &s;he threw her hand upon my &s;houlder, and a&s;ked me what &s;he was to do! And there was &s;uch a &mdash;a &s;omething, in her manner of look, and in her manner of &s;peaking, that I was all over in a tremble, from head to foot. Aye&mdash;aye, &s;aid I, Ben|jamin&mdash;friend&s;hip&mdash;friend&s;hip&mdash;She &s;aid, that &s;he never dare to go home again without the money, and &s;he had only two new &s;ix pences, and a &s;ilver penny, and a little copper keep|&s;ake, in the world, and even <HI>they</HI> were locked up in her trunk, at the bottom of all her things: with this, &s;ir, I put my hand in my pocket, and took out the fifteen &s;hillings, and told out ten and &s;ix pence on the table, and was ju&s;t going to put it into Nancy's hand, when &s;omething &s;truck
<PB N="118" REF="133">me to the heart, as much as to tell me I was going to do a bad thing: upon which I drew away my hand, and took up the &s;ilver again: then feeling, &s;ir, in my other pocket, I took out a &s;pank &s;pan new half-crown piece, which young mi&s;tre&s;s gave me, and was only &s;orry that I had no more: at la&s;t I took out my uncle's money, and told it over again, that is, eight and &s;ix pence: but &s;ure &s;ome|thing bewitched me, for I quite trembled as I laid it down, and &s;o as la&s;t told Nancy the whole affair.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, &s;ir, &s;he did not much like the money <HI>at all,</HI>&mdash;the, between friends, what is it?&mdash;But when &s;he under&s;tood it belonged to my uncle Abrahams, &s;he turned as pale as her apron, and cried out, Lord

<PB N="120" REF="135">with fir&s;t one thing, and then an|other: &s;o I &s;aid nothing to Nancy, but de&s;ired her to &s;it &s;till, till I came back, which &s;hould be in a few mi|nutes. She &s;eemed unea&s;y to let me go, but at la&s;t con&s;ented; and as I was going into a little bye alley, to take off my wai&s;tcoat, and &s;omething el&s;e, who &s;hould come that way, but Mr. Mendman, my uncle's taylor, who always loved me, from a boy, and always &s;aid, I one day &s;hould be rich.&mdash;As &s;ure as you live, this gene|rous &s;oul lent me a whole guinea, without my telling him a word a|bout Nancy; and away I ran, &s;carce touching the ground, and not giving my&s;elf time to put on the things I had taken off, and hardly buttoning my coat. At fir&s;t, Nancy was quite
<PB N="121" REF="136">frighted&mdash;then blu&s;hed&mdash;for to tell you the truth, (here he whi&s;pered,) my &s;hirt was one of the things&mdash;as I dare not pledge any thing in <HI>&s;ight,</HI> for fear my uncle &s;hould &s;ee me before I could get up &s;tairs into my room.&mdash;But I went out again, and put my things on, and &s;oon cleared up the whole matter.</P>
<P>We then went home together, and there I found old Mr. Dennis crying, and taking on, like a child: as &s;oon as he &s;aw us, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing to &s;cold Nancy, he ran to her, fa&s;tened on her neck, ki&s;&s;ed her, and &s;hed tears: for his pa&s;&s;ion was now all over, and his love for his poor dear Nancy returned at once.</P>
<P>But not to trouble you with any more of this part of the &s;tory, I &s;hall
<PB N="122" REF="137">only &s;ay, that I left the old man hugging his daughter, and, I don't know why, but me thought I could have hugged them <HI>both!</HI> However. Nancy &s;ighing&mdash;becau&s;e &s;he was quite weary, and her &s;pirits gone, thanked me, with a tear in her eye, and I went out of the hou&s;e, hardly knowing what I had done, or where I was going.</P>

<P>I had got almo&s;t home, &s;ometime whi&s;tling, &s;ometimes &s;inging, and &s;ometimes jumping for joy, before I recollected that I had &s;till the money in my pocket; and that perhaps old Dennis (though he might pa&s;s over
<PB N="123" REF="138">the lo&s;s while he was warm, might talk about it when he was cool). would be cruel again, as he loved money. So, I e'en ran back to the hou&s;e, and found the old man quite bu&s;ied in laying the cloth, warming a little can of beer, and pre&s;&s;ing Nancy to eat, with a great deal of kindne&s;s, I &s;oon found he had never once men|tioned the half guinea, and &s;o laid down the ten &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, telling Nancy that it was a great chance we <HI>met the fellow,</HI> and that it was well &s;he knew him again. God for give me, &s;ir, for I made a fine &s;tory of it!</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis's heart, however, was open, and he in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;itting down, and drink a draught of his own brewing; for, indeed, he <HI>belonged</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="139">to a brew-hou&s;e. So, as I was to drink my Nancy's health, I &s;at down; and, &s;ome how or other, got into &s;inging &s;ongs, till at la&s;t Mr. Dennis's ale got into my head, and made me forget&mdash;(as you know one's time &s;lips away in agreeable company)&mdash;that I had &s;tayed already &s;o long from my uncle I therefore caught up my has and &s;tick, when I heard the cluck &s;trike &s;ix; and, in a great hurry, &s;et forward for Mrs. Darlington's.</P>
<P>Unluckily, however, &s;ir, I happened to pa&s;s by the door of Mr. Suet, the chandler, and as I was angry with him for his &s;light to Nancy, I called upon him, to tell him a little piece of my mind. Mr. Suet, &s;aid I, you are a good natured man, and I come to thank you for your kindne&s;s to poor
<PB N="125" REF="140">Nancy Dennis la&s;t night. Nancy Dennis be d&mdash;d, &s;aid Suet, who was a pa&s;&s;ionate fellow, and one of your great &s;ighters into the bargain &mdash;What's Nancy Dennis to me?&mdash; She kept me and my family up all night; but you are her <HI>favourite,</HI> I forgot that&mdash;It's a pity you did not &s;ee her, when &s;he was turned out by her father, who has been making a &s;ine piece of work here, truly, be|cau&s;e, for&s;ooth, I let her give the fellow that came into the &s;hop a half guinea to change. What had I to do with her half guinea? A little &s;illy pu&s;s, I wi&s;h I had never &s;een her face; for I &s;hall lofe a good cu&s;tomer by her&mdash;a fooli&s;h minx; I can't think how Dennis could tru&s;t her with any money. My blood boiled at him, &s;ir,
<PB N="126" REF="141">all the time he &s;poke, and when he called the poor girl tho&s;e names, I lo&s;t all patience, and &s;o, without more ado, I laid my &s;witch over his &s;houl|ders; upon which we both of us went to it, and fought, till &s;ome neighbours took Suet away, and lock|ed him up, and &s;o parted us: but I would fight for a friend, to the la&s;t drop of my blood, &s;ir,&mdash;nay, for that matter, I have lo&s;t a good deal o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that already; but I have had my re|venge on that hard-hearted ra&s;cal, Suet, and &s;o I don't mind my black eyes, or bloody cloaths, of a farthing. And now, &s;ir, you know the whole &s;tory, and I hope you can't blame me, &s;eeing as how I did it to &s;erve a wo|man.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="142">Blame you, &s;aid I, Benjamin&mdash;no, &s;ay good lad, I admire thy &s;pirit, and honour thee for thy &s;entiments; and, indeed, I approve your conduct &s;o much, through every part of your adventure, that I will go this in&s;tant and make peace betwixt you and Mr. Abrahams. You are very kind, in, &s;ays Benjamin, but if you plea&s;e you may as well not &s;ay any thing about Nancy, for you know old peo|ple think &s;uch &s;trange things, and have &s;uch odd notions about friend|&s;hip, that perhaps he might take it into his head to&mdash;I under&s;tand you, Ben, &s;aid I, and I will bring you off without once mentioning your friend, Nancy, depend on it.&mdash;I now went down &s;tairs to &s;ee after my &s;ick cou|&s;in, whom, indeed, I had too long
<PB N="128" REF="143">left, without making a &s;mall breach in good manners. But as it happened, &s;he continued in her room, and her aunt with her, till &s;upper was almo&s;t ready, and the ladies were but ju&s;t got into the parlour before me.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce opened the door, when both ladies began their inqui|ries after Benjamin, and I believe mi&s;s Alicia obliged me with ten que&s;|tions&mdash;&s;o little art, and &s;o much na|ture had &s;he&mdash;before it was po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould return her one an&s;wer. Re|&s;olved, however, to make no more di&s;turbances, I now took a contrary method, and &s;aid every thing that I thought might plea&s;e the young one, without betraying what I thought was apparent enough to the old one; and if I mi&s;take not, this was the fir&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="144">time I convinced my&s;elf how nece&s;&s;ary it is for a per&s;on, who would live up|on any peaceable terms with &s;ociety, to give into many petty deceptions, where the plain truth would infalli|bly create confu&s;ion and di&s;quietude: and this &s;ort of duplicity, is, I pre|&s;ume, what the Latins call, a pious fraud. Yet &s;omething there was in my nature utterly repugnant to this, nor could the be&s;t of motives ever re|concile it to my heart.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, this <HI>embelli&s;hment</HI> of the truth had a great effect in &s;oothing the &s;omething that &s;at heavy on the bo&s;om of Alicia; for, after I had told her that Mr. Benjamin had accidentally met an old friend, with whom he was tempted to drink a little freely, and afterwards got into a boyi&s;h di&s;pute, of which
<PB N="130" REF="145">the wor&s;t con&s;equence was likely to be only a bloody &s;uit of cloaths, &s;he gave his misfortunes a mixture of &s;miles and tears, the latter of which, however, &s;he kept from falling, and at la&s;t &s;he grew &s;o plea&s;ant, without &s;eeming to lodge too much on the &s;ubject, that &s;he actually told Mrs. Darlington &s;he found her&s;elf &s;o much recovered, that &s;he &s;hould be able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eat a whole wing of a chicken. This declaration, on the other hand, &s;et <HI>Mrs. Darlington</HI>'s heart at re&s;t, who mo&s;t affectionately loved her niece, and &s;upper was now ordered without delay. Willing to do, notwith&s;tand|ing, as much as I could in this affair, I &s;lipt out of the parlour to &s;eek Mr. Abrahams, whom I found in the &s;teward's office, with his &s;pectacles on
<PB N="131" REF="146">his no&s;e, very indu&s;triou&s;ly employed in examining a large book, like a trade&s;man's ledger, in which he was perhaps &mdash; (this being Saturday) &mdash; ca&s;ting up and adju&s;ting the accounts of the week. Something&mdash;probably a re&s;lection upon the buckles,&mdash;had put him in high good humour, and he con&s;idered the intere&s;t I took in his nephew's conciliation in &s;uch good part, that he left his bu&s;ine&s;s on pur|po&s;e to mount the &s;tairs, and a&s;&s;ure me that he forgave Ben, and then &s;hook him heartily by the hand in my pre|&s;ence. I &s;hould not, however, forget that Mr. Abrahams ju&s;t hinted at the pro&s;pect of &s;ending the bloody cloaths with &s;ucce&s;s to the &s;cowrers. Thus happine&s;s being re&s;tored to the whole family, the re&s;t of the evening was
<PB N="132" REF="147">pa&s;&s;ed in general &s;atisfaction, and I withdrew to my chamber, not a little in&s;tructed, nor a little plea&s;ed, at having been in &s;ome degree an in&s;tru|ment in bringing about the agreeable cata&s;trophe of the evening.</P>

<P>The next morning dawned upon the unanimity of Mrs. Darlington's family. Alicia retained her u&s;ual flow of &s;pirits, Benjamin was getting the better of his brui&s;es: the old lady re|joiced in the recovery of her niece, and the &s;teward chuckled over the gift of the &s;ilver buckles, and the &s;uc|ce&s;s he expected from &s;ending the coat and wai&s;tcoat to the &s;cowerers.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="148">A whole week pa&s;&s;ed, in which this general felicity rather improved than dimini&s;hed: but Felicity is at be&s;t but a coy vi&s;itant, fickle in her friend&s;hip, and un&s;teady in her attachments: and, perhaps, if &s;he conde&s;cends to &s;tay &s;even days in a family, it is as much as can well be expected. Change of air, immoderate walking (for my cu|rio&s;ity laid a heavy tax upon my legs) or &s;ome other cau&s;e, brought on a cold, &s;o that on the Sunday even|ing &s;ucceeding the&s;e matters, I was quite hoar&s;e, and did little more than cough, and &s;uck &s;ugar candy; a &s;pe|cific for this di&s;order, which I adopt|ed in the nur&s;ery, and which, if not infallible, is at lea&s;t as e&s;&s;icacious, as many a no&s;trum of prouder name, and dearer purcha&s;e. There was always,
<PB N="134" REF="149">however, a &s;ort of <HI>&s;timulus</HI> in my tem|per, which would never &s;uffer me to be &s;upine, whether I was in &s;ickne&s;s or in health, in &s;olitude or in &s;ocie|ty. To this natural activity, per|chance, I owe many &s;trokes of for|tune, which men of dormant and indolent propen&s;ities never experi|ence: but I was inclined to bri&s;k vo|lition from my cradle, and as we all naturally <HI>di&s;like</HI> whatever is naturally <HI>unlike</HI> our&s;elves,&mdash;I mean in points of &s;entiment&mdash;I will now give the rea|der an early in&s;tance of my anti|pathy to every thing that wanted vi|vacity.</P>
<P>In my childhood, I was one day walking in a meadow, when I hap|pened to &s;trike my foot again&s;t a &s;tone&mdash;Wretch, &s;aid I&mdash;a little vexed
<PB N="135" REF="150">by the pain &mdash; Wretch, how I pity thee?

The proverb was verified; pride had <HI>a fall:</HI> I felt it; and as I ro&s;e from the ground, &s;aid thus to my&s;elf: How unworthy is arrogance&mdash;What right
<PB N="136" REF="151">had I to taunt and break my pitiful je&s;ts upon an innocent pebble, &s;leep|ing quietly in it's bed, performing it's allotted ta&s;k in dutiful &s;ilence, and gradually &s;preading into bulk, peradventure, to mend the very cart|rut, over which the foot of my hor&s;e, or the wheel of my carriage is to pa&s;s more &s;afely: if I were not afraid of being called &s;uper&s;titious, I &s;hould think this &s;prain of my ancle a judg|ment. Be it what it will; if it teaches me humility, I &s;hall con&s;ider it as a very &s;ea&s;onable tumble, and &s;o (here I was obliged to bind a hand|kerchief hard round the part a&s;&s;ect|ed) as for the matter of a little &s;mart, I believe it may be whole&s;ome enough. &mdash;Saying this, I found the tears in my eyes, (for my ancle was &s;welling a|pace) and went limping away.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="152">I mention this as a trait of my cha|racter, and a judicious reader will in|deed find &s;omething more <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;en|tially</HI> characteri&s;tic in the&s;e minute deve|lopements, than in the mo&s;t elaborate detail of what hi&s;torians very fal&s;ely call, <HI>marking</HI> circum&s;tances. I have often wi&s;hed, &s;ince this trifling accident, that I could have changed &s;ituations with the poor &s;tone: if motion can|not produce re&s;t, methinks there was nothing &s;o extravagant in the idea: yet was there much ill-nature in it; for I have &s;een and felt enough to de&s;troy the con&s;titution, even of the &s;tone it&s;elf, and by a change of condi|tions, it would, I am pretty certain, have had the wor&s;t of the bargain.

<P>Though my cold confined me to the hou&s;e, it did not confine me to the chamber: I had therefore &s;ufficient &s;cope for ob&s;ervation; and that too, on a part of life with which I was hitherto unacquainted. The incidents which are con&s;tantly happening in every family, are ample enough to excite infinite reflection in the minds of the &s;peculative; no wonder, there|fore, that I found ample &s;ubjects for
<PB N="142" REF="157">two or three days. Perhaps I was rather fortunate in this re&s;pect, or the &s;aid two or three days might teem with dome&s;tic adventures: for two very great events happened at Mrs. Darlington's while I continued an in|valid, and I &s;hall relate them, as I am re&s;olved to do every thing el&s;e, exact|ly as they fell out at the time.</P>
<P>Mr. Jonathan Abrahams began to take a great fancy to me, which the ladies told me I might con&s;ider as no trifling favour; a&s;&s;uring me, that he was by no means apt to <HI>take likings,</HI> and particularly to <HI>young people,</HI> whom he in general treated as a pack of &s;triplings, who know nothing of bu|&s;ine&s;s, and whom he always &s;poke of with the mo&s;t &s;upercilious con|tempt: but it &s;eems, I was down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="143" REF="158">the credit &s;ide of his books, where, no doubt, the &s;ilver buckles <HI>figured</HI> re&s;pectably. Be that as it may, I was not di&s;plea&s;ed with his attention&mdash;for be&s;ides that it gratified my vanity, it gratified an higher pa&s;&s;ion, in giving me an opportunity now and then to throw in a word or two, by the bye, for my friend Benjamin.</P>
<P>It happened, that during my re|ce&s;s at home, Mrs. Darlington and her niece were under an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity to pay a debt of vi&s;itings.&mdash; This debt had been long due, and the di&s;charging it po&s;tponed from day to day, in mere compliment to me, as I declined attending them through the ceremonies of introduction: but as the debt was due to per&s;ons with whom the ladies &s;tood on &s;ome little
<PB N="144" REF="159">punctilio, the payment could now no longer be evaded, without a &s;lur on that politene&s;s of principle, which genteel people con&s;ider as a &s;ancti|monious appendage of public cha|racter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darlington, indeed, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|turally a little punctilious, and mi&s;s had no objection to keep upon the &s;quare with the acquaintances &s;he did not care a farthing for; &s;o that to have delayed the thing any longer would have been downright ill-breed|ing: a reproach no woman of fa&s;hion can po&s;&s;ibly put up with, as it implies &s;omething va&s;tly more &s;hocking than the imputation of intrigue, or even of the mi&s;take it&s;elf. To prevent, therefore, &s;o iniquitous a violation of the laws of high life, I exerted my
<PB N="145" REF="160">atmo&s;t rhetoric to reque&s;t they would take the opportunity of my wi&s;hing to write letters, and tumble over books, and rub off the long &s;core which their acquaintances had marked again&s;t them, as could be te&s;tified by a variety of bills drawn upon the cards, which were laid in the windows, tucked in the carvings of the gla&s;&s;es, and di&s;played round every mantle|piece. My argument at length pre|vailed, and pretending on my part a wonderful deal of private bu&s;ine&s;s, that mu&s;t at all events be done, the ladies paid a vi&s;it, fir&s;t to them&s;elves in their looking-gla&s;&s;es, in their dre&s;s|ing-rooms&mdash;then to the re&s;lection of the &s;ame per&s;ons, when they got down &s;tairs into the parlour&mdash;becau&s;e it may po&s;&s;ibly happen that gla&s;&s;es
<PB N="146" REF="161">differ as well as watches; and la&s;tly to the ladies, the <HI>living</HI> ladies, who, retired within their drawing-rooms, were actually waiting for them.</P>
<P>And here I cannot omit a word or two on the curious commerce be|twixt tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed under the general title of the <HI>polite:</HI> at lea&s;t &s;uch among them as are re&s;i|dent in and about the courtly circle of the capital. The point of ceremony is critically adju&s;ted, and the grada|tions, from the cold &s;alute of the per|fect well-bred &s;tranger, to the mo&s;t familiar ardours of the animated friend, are di&s;criminated with a <HI>mi|nutene&s;s,</HI> which, employed on &s;ubjects of equal, or even <HI>more</HI> importance might produce to &s;ociety &s;omething highly edifying. Po&s;&s;ibly it may not
<PB N="147" REF="162">be unamu&s;ing to throw together a few in&s;tances, from the multitude I collected, in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;erv|ations on the cu&s;toms of <HI>the polite.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Jonathan Abrahams him&s;elf never &s;truck the ballance of debtor and creditor, or under&s;tood the &s;e|crets of the <HI>per conpra,</HI> more preci&s;ely than many well-bred people, who ne|verthele&s;s hate mathematics, and could as ea&s;ily &s;olve the knottie&s;t problem in Euclid, as repeat their table of multiplication. The truth is, Mr. Abrahams' book of accounts re|&s;embles the account-books of the mo|di&s;h, only in two great particulars, viz. in <HI>paying</HI> and <HI>receiving;</HI> and in the&s;e re&s;pects, many of them are as exact as the good &s;teward, though he &s;hould bring down the fraction to the twen|ty-nine-thou&s;andth

The&s;e are what may properly be call|ed, your annual vi&s;itors, or people who &s;ettle accounts once in the year; and therein the bu&s;ine&s;s differs wide|ly from the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Abra|hams: for, &s;hould that faithful gen|tleman happen to call on any tenant at quarter-day, and in&s;tead of re|ceiving his money, receive an apo|logy or a denial, the matter would mo&s;t likely have a &s;erious face, and produce &s;erious con&s;equences: but in the adju&s;tment of the&s;e politer tran&s;|actions, where the parties know what they are about, the point is &s;oon re|conciled: the coachman drives lady A to lady B's hou&s;e; the footman thunders out a polite alarm at the door. Lady B happens unfortunate|ly to be from home; lady A putting
<PB N="149" REF="164">her head out of the &s;a&s;h of the car|riage to receive the me&s;&s;ages, &s;ees, perhaps, the identical lady B at one of the windows; but as &s;he is <HI>not at home,</HI> there is no &s;uch thing as nods or curte&s;ies, but the vi&s;it is <HI>paid,</HI> and lady A orders the &s;ervant to go as fa&s;t as the hor&s;es can gallop to Mrs. C's, while lady B is either &s;itting cool in her own parlour, or el&s;e preparing to pay her compliments to &s;ome other ladies of the alphabet, in the &s;ame manner: or, as we are told in the play, if &s;he choo&s;es to be politer &s;till, &s;he will entertain her acquaintances at home, and &s;end round her <HI>empty</HI> chair, to entertain her acquaintances abroad.</P>
<P>Upon vi&s;itings of a nature &s;ome|what le&s;s ceremonious, were Mrs.
<PB N="150" REF="165">Darlington and her niece now gone.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>It was a pre-concerted thing be|twixt Abrahams and me, to enjoy a &s;ocial hour together, the very fir&s;t time I could &s;teal, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, from the gaiety of magnificent mad|ne&s;s,
<PB N="152" REF="167">to plain &s;ober meaning common|&s;en&s;e; by which was literally meant no more than preferring his company to that of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after the ladies were gone then, Jonathan conducted me into a commodious little apartment, which led into his office, where, placing me in his own arm-chair, he &s;hook me re&s;pectfully by the hand, and wel|comed me to his hut; and pre&s;ently, &s;ir, cries Jonathan, we'll crack an in|nocent bottle. On this he rang the bell, and two or three &s;ervants im|mediately obeyed the &s;ummons. Tell Mrs. Goodby, &s;aid the &s;teward, to &s;end me the &s;ugar ba&s;on, and lemon &s;queezers; perhaps, &s;ir, you may pre|fer a tiff of punch; &s;ome love one thing, &s;ome another. Every man in
<PB N="153" REF="168">his humour. If we were all to like the &s;ame thing, what would become of us; what's one man's meat is an|other man's poi&s;on. In &s;hort, Mr. Abrahams exemplified and corrobo|rated almo&s;t every &s;entiment, by pro|verbial evidence; and he went on to prove, how natural it was for &s;ome men to love punch, and &s;ome wine, till a bottle of the one, and a bowl of the other, might very fairly have been con&s;umed.</P>
<P>Whether Abrahams had really any &s;aving policy in this method of inter|luding his conver&s;ation with old &s;aws, I cannot tell. The &s;ugar at la&s;t became u&s;eful, and unlocking a clo&s;et that &s;tood in the corner of the room, and a bin that was made in the win|dow &s;eat, he produced from the one
<PB N="154" REF="169">a ca&s;e of bottles, &s;uch as are frequent among&s;t mariners, and from the other <HI>another</HI> bottle, which he &s;aid was al|mo&s;t as old as him&s;elf. He now begged permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ill his pipe, which be|ing readily granted, a candle, which he took from his beaufet, being lighted, (and afterwards extingui&s;hed) and every other act of deliberation over, he &s;hook me once more by the hand, as he was &s;eating him&s;elf, and repeated his gladne&s;s to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>You would hardly think it, &s;ir, cries Johnathan, (fixing the pipe in his mouth)&mdash;you would hardly &s;up|po&s;e that I prefer this piece of a <HI>mou&s;e-hole,</HI> as I may call it, to any room in Mrs. Darlington's hou&s;e! 'Tan't the bigne&s;s of a thing con&s;ti|tutes the goodne&s;s. You, perhaps,
<PB N="155" REF="170">call it a <HI>nut &s;hell.</HI> It may be &s;o, yet what is &s;weeter than the kernel? Very true, Mr. Abrahams, an&s;wered I&mdash; Pardon me, &s;ir, quoth the &s;teward, there is &s;omething about you that I like; you may &s;ee my re&s;pect, in|deed, by wearing your favour&mdash;here he pointed to his &s;hoes, on which were the &s;ilver buckles.&mdash;A keep|&s;ake, Mr. Benignus, is a keep-&s;ake, and &s;hould be held &s;acred. <HI>Memoria ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">e.</HI> If a man was to part from any thing I gave him for this purpo&s;e, though it were but a chee&s;e-paring&mdash; though it were but the bowl of this tobacco-pipe.&mdash;I &s;hould never have any opinion of him again. Sir, I will wear the&s;e buckles till they are ten times thinner than a &s;ix-pence; and &s;o, &s;ir, here's my hearty &s;ervice to
<PB N="156" REF="171">you. I was &s;o charmed with Jona|than's gratitude, and expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, that my heart opened, and I was &s;orry that I had &s;o &s;habbily purcha&s;ed his e&s;teem. A pair of &s;ilver buckles, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, as he was taking off the punch, pitiful!</P>
<P>I have often thought, re&s;umed he, (&s;etting his gla&s;s down,) of buying me a couple of label's to hang round the necks of my bottles, but I don't know how it is, one thing or another takes away one's money, and leaves nothing for trifles: yet &s;ome day I will cer|tainly do it, for you mu&s;t know I am a &s;trange fellow; every thing in this room, and in that office, is <HI>my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and I am &s;uch a &s;ort of a chap, that I can't even &s;it down on another per&s;on's property, unle&s;s I pay for it. That's
<PB N="157" REF="172">being very con&s;cientious, indeed, &s;aid I. It is &s;o, an&s;wered Abrahams; but you &s;hall hear. I have been an old &s;tandard in this family, and am be|&s;ides a piece of a relation to Mrs. Dar|lington; but I made a rule many years ago, upon having a legacy of fifty pounds left me per annum, that however poor my apparel, food, or furniture, it &s;hould be my own pro|perty. Having a method of making fifty pounds go a good way, I came to a re&s;olution, and put it into prac|ti&s;e. Madam, &s;ays I to Mrs. Dar|lington, I am an odd fellow, a very odd fellow, and having now a little windfall come to me, I am re&s;olved to employ it in providing my&s;elf with all nece&s;&s;aries. Content is as good as a fea&s;t. What do you mean Mr. Abra|hams,
<PB N="158" REF="173">&s;ays &s;he, why &s;ure you won't leave me in this manner: you know every thing is under your eye, and I &s;hall be ruined without you. Madam, &s;ays I, you mi&s;under&s;tand me. I do not intend to kick the &s;tool from un|der me. Some hone&s;t gleanings of my indu&s;try, I have certainly picked up under Sir Robert Darlington, and fifty pounds a year more comes to me by gift. Put that and that together, and I have a mor&s;el of bread and a mor&s;el of butter, of my own, the year round. I have neverthele&s;s a kind love for the Darlington's&mdash;u&s;e is &s;e|cond nature. What is your drift, Johnathan, &s;aid &s;he? Why, madam, an&s;wered I, to tell you <HI>in few,</HI> the <HI>needful</HI> at once, I will continue your &s;teward as u&s;ual, but I mu&s;t purcha&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="174">the furniture of my office and my parlour, and pay you &s;o much per annum for the hou&s;e-rent, and after that you &s;hall give me &s;uch a yearly &s;alary, as in your own judgment ap|pears &s;ufficient, and I mu&s;t al&s;o allow &s;o much for my board, otherwi&s;e be per|mitted to find my own diet. Only con&s;ent to &s;tay, Abrahams, cries Mrs. Darlington, and you &s;hall do as you plea&s;e. Well, &s;ir, the point was at la&s;t &s;ettled in this manner. I bought the things you &s;ee at &s;econd hand. Mrs. Darlington would take no re|fu&s;al as to the <HI>compliment</HI> of my board, and &s;he was plea&s;ed to increa&s;e my my &s;tipend, &s;o as to make my income comfortable. One good turn de&s;erves another: I have now made my&s;elf as nece&s;&s;ary to her, as her e&s;tate; in|deed,
<PB N="160" REF="175">I have rai&s;ed the <HI>value</HI> of her e&s;tate &s;ome hundreds a year &s;ince Sir Robert Darlington's death; Sir Ro|bert, you mu&s;t know, was an ea&s;y man, and let his lands always at the &s;ame rent, &s;o that his tenants got a great deal too fat: nay, one of them had the impudence to keep a couple of better hunters than any in his land|lord's &s;table, and the daughters to&s;&s;ed up their no&s;es in &s;uch a &s;aucy manner, that they fainted at the &s;ight of a dairy, and &s;et their caps, for&s;ooth, at a for|tune. But I &s;oon brought their fine hunters to a plain hone&s;t cart-hor&s;e, made them earn their bread like fa|ther Adam, and turned the furbelows and flounces of the forward young mi&s;&s;es, into their decent hou&s;ewi&s;ely apparel&mdash;aye, and put a round &s;um
<PB N="161" REF="176">into Mrs. Darlington's pocket into the bargain.</P>
<P>This was acting the man of &s;pirit, &s;aid I, Mr. Abrahams. It was, an|&s;wered Abrahams, I believe, acting, at one and the &s;ame time, the politi|cian, the landlord, and the &s;teward; and, between you and I, if Sir Robert had held it out much longer, there's ne'er a mother's &s;on, nor daughter, upon the grounds belonging to Dar|lington Lodge, would have been worth <HI>this</HI>&mdash;(meaning the a&s;hes of his pipe, which he was then gently knock'd again&s;t the bars of the grate.) But pray, &s;ir, drink, I believe you will find that, (pointing to the bowl,) pretty tolerable &s;tuff. I now drank, for the fir&s;t time; for this worthy &s;teward had &s;o puzzled me by his enig|matic
<PB N="162" REF="177">conver&s;ation, and &s;poke in &s;o ex|traordinary a manner, that he &s;aved his liquor by his &s;ingularity. He had now talked almo&s;t half an hour (for he was very deliberate in his articu|lation) and I could not well make either one thing or another of him.</P>
<P>He was, <HI>altogether,</HI> the odde&s;t cha|racter which had ever yet come with|in my knowledge. I was &s;ometimes apt to &s;uppo&s;e, by his air of au&s;terity, that he was a much greater man in point of di&s;tinction, than he pretend|ed to be: but there was &s;omething of &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s in his manners, which was &s;trangely di&s;gu&s;ting. I put toge|ther &s;uch parts of his conduct as a|mazed me. The confe&s;&s;ion he made, of having lent a man money upon a diamond ring; his &s;aluting a man
<PB N="163" REF="178">with the greate&s;t cordiality, whom in the very next moment he called as arrant a ra&s;cal as any in the three king|doms; his never having &s;et his foot within a church&mdash;his &s;iddle&s;tick of faith; his anxiou&s;ne&s;s about the lo&s;t buckle&mdash;his &s;quabble with the &s;ilver|&s;mith&mdash;his treatment of the poor fe|male &s;eavenger&mdash;his anger at the mi&s;|fortune of his nephew&mdash;his mean|ne&s;s about the fare of the coachman; with &s;everal other circum&s;tances, caught up in the cour&s;e of his la&s;t conver&s;ation, rendered his conduct &s;o truly my&s;tical, that I could much &s;oon|er have &s;olved any mathematical diffi|culty, than have unfolded the riddle that di&s;gui&s;ed the character of Mr. Jo|nathan Abrahams.</P>
<P>The conundrum was made &s;till more intricate, when, to the &s;trange
<PB N="164" REF="179">matters above, were added his more favourable parts of behaviour: &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as his gratitude for the tri&s;ting pre&s;ent of the buckles&mdash;his mode&s;t &s;imile of the nut-&s;hell&mdash;his love of independence&mdash;his veneration for keep-&s;akes&mdash;his integrity to the widow Darlington, who&s;e e&s;tate he had improved; his changing running|hor&s;es to cart-hor&s;es; and his redu|cing the fly-away farmer's daughters to a proper &s;en&s;e of their condition. The only probable way for a per&s;on who is in doubt whether to pro|nounce a thing good, or bad, an equal mixture of both, or neither ab&s;olute|ly one or the other, is to follow the example of every hone&s;t trader, and, holding the &s;cales with an even hand, fairly weigh one property again&s;t an|other.
<PB N="165" REF="180">And this cu&s;tom, however &s;imple, would, if practi&s;ed in the world, &s;ave, I conceive, much &s;curri|lity and mi&s;take; for many charac|ters, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eeming to want weight, are, upon trial, found no way deficient, and it may po&s;&s;ibly happen that the &s;cale of indi&s;cretions, heavy as they may look, will kick the beam, while the &s;cale of virtues, &s;uppo&s;ed wanting, &s;hall very honour|ably preponderate.</P>
<P>As Mr. Abrahams was &s;ummoned out upon &s;ome occa&s;ion or another, ju&s;t as he had brought his di&s;cour&s;e and pipe to a conclu&s;ion, I had lei|&s;ure to weigh him as I thought pro|per; and, therefore, fairly placing what made for him on the one hand, with what made again&s;t him on the
<PB N="166" REF="181">other, the equipoi&s;e was very de|cently maintained: the wrong &s;cale trembled, indeed, &s;omewhat at fir&s;t towards the center, but, in the end, by making all po&s;&s;ible <HI>grains</HI> of allow|ance, he appeared at lea&s;t to be a mighty good meaning &s;ort of a pru|dent, pains-taking man: his errors, chiefly tho&s;e of affectation and ha|bit, and his virtues highly &s;uitable to the &s;teward of a rich widow, who was too much a woman of fa&s;hion to look into her own affairs. As &s;oon, therefore, as I took Mr. Jonathan out of the &s;cales, I made a memoran|dum of the labels to hang round the necks of his bottles.</P>

<P>Jonathan now re-entered in more bu&s;tle than u&s;ual, followed by a per|&s;on, to whom he quickly turned about, and &s;poke as follows: Aye, aye, Nabal, too many eggs in one ba&s;ket; the more ha&s;te, the wor&s;e &s;peed&mdash;too much of one thing is good for nothing: <HI>lente fe&s;tina:</HI> he &s;tumbles that goes fa&s;t; and &s;o there's two hundred and fifty gone at a &s;lap, a|gain: Well, well, Nabal, never mind that, we can but be ruined, we can but be ruined. Here he &s;hook his perriwig by the foretop, while the powder flew about the room, and be&s;pread the face of Nabal, who &s;till
<PB N="168" REF="183">maintained his &s;tation behind, not|with&s;tanding Jonathan's attempt to face him.&mdash;A damned &s;pra&s;h, indeed, cries Nabal, wiping his face, but the man is gone the world over. Run away too, the ra&s;cal, hey? an&s;wered Jonathan. To the devil, &s;aid Nabal. What's the matter, gentlemen, &s;aid I, I hope no misfortune? Sir, replied Abrahams, I have lo&s;t two hundred and fifty pounds for doing a generous action. That's hard, indeed, &s;aid I; And what's wor&s;e, cries the &s;teward, it was done with another man's pro|ney. Poor Benjamin's whole fortune, I can a&s;&s;ure you: well, Nabal, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it. Run your eye over the Daily, and the Gazet|teer, and call again in the morning. Nabal nodded his head, and di&s;ap|peared,
<PB N="169" REF="184">while Abrahams &s;at down in his chair, begged my pardon for the di&s;order into which this unlucky &s;troke had thrown him, and muttered, between his teeth, the words, villain, caitiff, and &s;coundrel, with great fer|vour.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed to know the cau&s;e of this calamity.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the &s;teward, &s;haking me by the hand, I wi&s;h, with all my &s;oul, that my heart was made of adamant. I wi&s;h I had no more commi&s;eration than this poker. A ra&s;cal came to me, &s;ometime ago, with a pitiful face, whom I knew from a baby, and thought, God help me, as hone&s;t as my&s;elf; he would have &s;hut up &s;hop&mdash;a &s;ugar|baker, &s;ir,&mdash;in four hours, if <HI>I</HI> had not kept him going,&mdash;Well, &s;ir, he
<PB N="170" REF="185">wanted two hundred and fifty pieces &mdash;I had no money at home, having ju&s;t then made a purcha&s;e. Mrs. Dar|lington was pretty deep in the repair|way, and I could not command a &s;hilling, without breach of tru&s;t. What was to be done.&mdash;Oliver, &s;aid I to the man, you mu&s;t e'en make a break of it: but he threw his tears upon me, knowing what a fool of a heart I had, and indeed melted me down to &s;uch an ignoramus, that I touched upon poor Ben's property, which was left him la&s;t year by his godfather, and put the boy's whole fortune into the hands of this Oliver, who gave me, as I hoped to be &s;aved, nothing but a couple of crazy buildings, in the wor&s;t part of the city, and his bond for &s;e|curity. The cottages may tumble
<PB N="171" REF="186">down, or be burnt up to-night, and he may die to-morrow; then what's his bond good for? But now behold you, the villain has &s;hipped him&s;elf off for the Devil's Ar&s;e a Peak, the Lord of Heaven knows where, and I may go whi&s;tle for my money. But the longer a man lives, the more he knows: if I was to live to the age of Methu&s;alem, I'd never do another friendly thing to man, woman, or child&punc; He has cured me of that. You may deceive a man once, and it's not his fault. Deceive him again, and he ought to be crucified. A burnt child dreads the fire. For Oliver's &s;ake I'll for&s;wear friend&s;hip: I will, I will, I will!</P>
<P>In uttering this harangue, Jonathan heated as he went; and, like a wheel
<PB N="172" REF="187">in violent motion, became at la&s;t &s;o in|ten&s;ely hot, that at the clo&s;e of the &s;peech he actually fired; and while he emphatically repeated the words, I will! there was as much horror in his look, fury in his eyes, blood in his face, and froth at his mouth, as ever exhibited them&s;elves in the counte|nance of a dog, in the arid month of July, expiring under the agonies of canine di&s;traction. I exhorted him to be pacified, and bade him exert his fortitude. A fig for fortitude, &s;ir, I'll burn his buildings, and throw his bond into the middle of the blaze, and if the hand which &s;igned it was there into the bargain, I would not pull it out with a pair of tongs. I can bear any thing but ingratitude. 'Tis not the money, but the man.
<PB N="173" REF="188">Sir, I would have pawned my &s;alva|tion on this fellow's hone&s;ty. I don't think he ever behaved like a &s;coundrel before.&mdash;Then &s;urely, Mr. Abrahams, &s;aid I, he de&s;erves a&mdash;a&mdash;He de&s;erves a halter, replied the &s;teward. Tut, tut, never tell me: once a &s;coundrel, and always a &s;coundrel. By the &s;ame rule then, Mr. Abrahams, &s;aid I, once an hone&s;t man and always an hone&s;t man. No &s;uch thing, exclaimed Jo|nathan, almo&s;t delirious, and quite hoar&s;e&mdash;no &s;uch thing. I have known a fellow pay away money one day, and &s;teal it another. Sir, you're a young gentleman, and I'm only an old fool of &s;ixty-eight, who has given away my poor dear Ben's property to a ra&s;cal&mdash;my poor Ben, whom I love better than my eyes! Upon this
<PB N="174" REF="189">the tears came actually into the old man's eyes, while &s;ympathy brought drops of the &s;ame &s;ort into mine, by way, I &s;uppo&s;e, of keeping him company, and I was at lo&s;s whether mo&s;t to pity or de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t going to &s;ay &s;omething, in&s;pired by my too tender heart, when a gentle tap at the door prevented me. Jonathan &s;ternly bid the per&s;on come in; and Benjamin him&s;elf, as pale as his &s;hirt, made his appearance. The poor lad, knowing the infirmity of his uncle, and hearing his voice violently exerted, (as his chamber was immediately over the office,) came limping down &s;tairs, (as the kick he re|ceived in the knee, from the chand|ler, was &s;till retarding his recovery,) and was in hopes of admini&s;tering
<PB N="175" REF="190">&s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;teward. As &s;oon, therefore, as he entered, he for|got his lamene&s;'s, and ran to beg his uncle, for God's &s;ake, not to bring the gout into his &s;tomach, which he knew mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, if he conti|nued to give way to pa&s;&s;ion, bidding him remember how bad he was la&s;t winter was twelvemonth, and &s;aid he had rather die him&s;elf, than bury his dear, dear uncle, that brought him up, gave him &s;chooling, paid for the very &s;hirt he had upon his back, and had moreover put out his little for|tune, which was to &s;et him up by and by, to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>The former part of this affectionate &s;peech, &s;oftened the rugged nature, and &s;ettled the rigid mu&s;cles of this &s;trange compound, and operated like a charm;
<PB N="176" REF="191">&s;uch and &s;o rapid are the tran&s;itions, and &s;o in&s;tantly do different pa&s;&s;ions take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us: but at the con|clu&s;ion, when Benjamin mentioned the circum&s;tance of his uncle's great goodne&s;s, in placing out his legacy to the be&s;t advantage, he was &s;o &s;mote by the &s;ecret and bitter &s;atire of &s;uch unde&s;erved prai&s;e, that he po&s;itively &s;eized his own throat, in mere dete&s;|tation of him&s;elf, and gave his forehead two or three hearty &s;laps, as much as to &s;ignify that he was &s;triking a num|&s;kull: then &s;oftening again, he threw his arms over Benjamin's neck, and thus they remained for &s;everal mi|nutes, clinging together. A &s;troke of nature, and the pathetic, has more charms far me, than the gold of Ophir.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXV.</HEAD>
<P>Readers there are, I know, of &s;o critical and inqui&s;itive a temper, that every point mu&s;t be cleared up as they go on, or el&s;e the poor author is directly accu&s;ed of incon&s;i&s;tency. As it is my hearty wi&s;h, &s;hould I come into print, to &s;atisfy all peru&s;ers and purcha&s;ers, of what&s;oever denomina|tion, I &s;hall now &s;ettle &s;ome matter, which might otherwi&s;e &s;it a little hard upon a critical &s;tomach. And fir&s;t, as to circum&s;tances of <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place.</HI></P>
<P>It may &s;eem a little odd, that Mr. Benjamin &s;hould have &s;o <HI>ru&s;tic</HI> an air about him, &s;eeing that he was re&s;i|dent
<PB N="179" REF="194">in a very fa&s;hionable family, at|tended his ladies in St. James's Park, and had the pattern of &s;o London|looking a character as Mr. Abrahams before him. Be it known, therefore, that, till within the&s;e few months, Benjamin lived as a &s;ort of upper &s;ervant at the country &s;eat, which bore the name of Darlington Lodge, where this young lad was in&s;tructed in the office of &s;urveying, by a coun|try &s;chool-ma&s;ter; who, with the ex|ci&s;eman, two or three farmers, the landlord of the Three Blue Bells, and the re&s;t of Mrs. Darlington's dome&s;|tics, with a few cottagers, made the inhabitants of the whole village; and he was now in town, at the earne&s;t de|&s;ire of Mrs. Darlington her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="195">Whether this de&s;ire proceeded ori|ginally and entirely from her, is a point no way incumbent upon me to meddle with at pre&s;ent. Certain, however, it is, that the youth Lim|&s;elf had no &s;ort of objection to it; for Mr. Chri&s;topher Dennis, (the father of his friend Nancy,) formerly lived and manufactured the mild ale at the Three Blue Balls afore&s;aid; but, on a recommendation from the '&s;quire of the next village, he was now promot|ed to manufacture malt and hops, at a capital brewery in the Borough of London, and <HI>there,</HI> (as the reader has &s;een,) re&s;ided with him Nancy Den|nis, the <HI>friend</HI> of Mr. Benjamin.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ome may think, that the pride of the &s;teward would have pre|vented him from &s;uffering his nephew
<PB N="181" REF="196">to remain as a &s;ervant, though a <HI>fa|vourite</HI> &s;ervant: &s;ome may be &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that Mrs. Darlington did not di&s;cover the affection of her niece for this young fellow, through all the affectation of di&s;gui&s;es; while others may expre&s;s their wonder, that, after having made &s;o many wi&s;e re&s;olu|tions, I &s;hould do &s;o <HI>ra&s;h an action</HI> as that mentioned in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t chapter; for I will not attribute to any of my readers &s;o little &s;agacity, as not to &s;uppo&s;e they all under&s;tand, that, upon the &s;lip of paper left up|on the &s;teward's table was written a draught upon my agent (with whom the reader will be pre&s;ently acquaint|ed) for the &s;um of two hundred and fifty pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="197">Now to defend either this point, or any others, &s;o as to labour at ex|<HI>plaining away</HI> their blame or errour, I never &s;hall pretend. This Hi&s;tory is not de&s;igned to be the &s;tage for tho&s;e <HI>imaginary</HI> gods and godde&s;&s;es to act on, who never &s;aid or did an ill thing; but the matters herein related, are neither more, or le&s;s, than &s;ome &s;cenes, repre&s;enting and delineating mere <HI>human li&s;e,</HI> where characters and actions are di&s;played with all their beauties and blemi&s;hes, as blended in the con&s;titution by nature; and brought out by occa&s;ion. As far, therefore, as it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to clear up circum&s;tances, which have reference to the rules of compo&s;ition, &s;o far will I &s;tudy to ea&s;e the mind of the reader, but no farther. Should
<PB N="183" REF="198">he, therefore, &s;ay to him&s;elf, <HI>this</HI> is &s;trange, <HI>that</HI> is odd, <HI>this</HI> is fooli&s;h, and <HI>that</HI> is ab&s;urd; I can only an&s;wer, <HI>once for all,</HI> that I am neverthele&s;s an impartial biographer; and it would be very hard if it were expected I &s;hould not only <HI>de&s;cribe</HI> &s;trangene&s;s and oddity, folly and ab&s;urdity, but an&s;wer for it too. No, my dear reader, this burden I totally &s;hift from my &s;houlders. I tell you faithfully what has happened, and di&s;cover to you not only incidents but the per&s;ons of the drama: be it thy bu&s;ine&s;s to ac|count for, and to analize, to cen&s;ure, and to condemn.</P>
<P>Indeed, I &s;hall not, I fear, be able to clear up my <HI>own</HI> conduct to all rea|ders; and, notwith&s;tanding all which has been done, many will call me a
<PB N="184" REF="199"><HI>fool,</HI> many a <HI>madman,</HI> and more will wonder I am not now dying, rather in a ditch, than in a fore&s;t. Po&s;&s;ibly, however, &s;ome may pity, and &s;ome may weep: there are, it is pre&s;umed, certain pa&s;&s;ages in the&s;e adventures, levelled particularly at people of feel|ing. <HI>Such</HI> characters will haply be&s;tow &s;ome tears to my misfortunes, and if they do,&mdash;let them not ha&s;tily wipe them from the cheek, becau&s;e they can never look ungraceful.</P>
<P>Thus much then has been &s;aid, that the reader may not expect more than is intended; and now, hav|ing entered a caveat again&s;t all <HI>mi&s;ap|prehen&s;ions,</HI> and written a chapter, for this explanatory purpo&s;e, I cordially invite the readers company and at|tention again, to what I &s;hall, with|out

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Alicia took hold of my hand, like a good-natured, lively cozen, at her return, and, after &s;he had a&s;ked how the poor fellow's knee above &s;tairs did, told me, that &s;he had found out a companion for me, and that he would breakfa&s;t with me in the morn|ing. She then was about to withdraw to her dre&s;&s;ing-room, to pull off her finery, and enjoy the comforts of an undre&s;s; comforts which are none of the lea&s;t, for &s;urely nothing can be more di&s;agreeable than to &s;it in one's own hou&s;e, (after the fa|tigues
<PB N="186" REF="201">of vi&s;iting,) under a load of non&s;en&s;ical ornaments, and &s;uperfluous decoration; with hoops &s;preading out their formidable immen&s;ity, &s;ilks endangering of a &s;oil, pendents dang|ling at the ear, and ruffles bandaging up the elbow. To lay a&s;ide the&s;e, therefore, till fancy &s;ummoned them again from ehe drawer, Alicia had now opened the parlour-door; from which &s;he beheld <HI>&s;omething</HI> that changed her whole behaviour in a moment; and (though &s;he was hum|ming an Italian air the moment be|fore,) uttely altered her tune. This &s;omething, was Mr. Benjamin, who was then hopping acro&s;s the room into which the parlour-door opened, under his crutch, in his way from his uncle's office to his chamber: for the
<PB N="187" REF="202">poor lad's knee was &s;till very painful, and the apothecary &s;trongly enjoined re&s;t, to prevent, as he &s;aid, an impo&s;t|humation, and all vicious propen&s;ity to humours.</P>
<P>The handle of the door was &s;till in Alicia's hand, and being rather loo&s;e, it rattled as &s;he trembled. I was clo&s;e to her on the other &s;ide; but yet no artifice could po&s;&s;ibly conceal her agi|tation: Benjamin bowed, as well as his lamene&s;s permitted him, and pa&s;&s;|ed on. Luckily, however, for the lady, Mrs. Darlington went imme|diately from her carriage to her dre&s;&s;|ing-room, where &s;he &s;till remained. When &s;he had &s;omewhat collected her&s;elf, &s;he looked me full in the face, without &s;peaking a word, then lift|ing
<PB N="188" REF="203">up her hands and eyes, &s;he cried out, Oh God! Oh God! What a fool I am, and how ridiculous do I make my&s;elf: then hurrying away, &s;he hid her face, and tottered up into her chamber.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of Alicia had now fair|ly con&s;pired with opportunity to be|tray her, and the exact &s;ituation of her mind became too palpable to be mi&s;taken: nor was it po&s;&s;ible to know the temper, without pitying the pa&s;|&s;ion; for &s;he was a girl of a very am|bitious di&s;po&s;ition, had the loftie&s;t notions of rank, and heartily hated her&s;elf for entertaining any tender &s;entiments towards an object &s;o much beneath her.</P>
<P>Such, indeed, was her pride or prudence, that though (vulgarly
<PB N="189" REF="204">&s;peaking,) &s;he doated on Benjamin to di&s;traction, that very Benjamin never once &s;u&s;pected it. And, contrary to the general cu&s;tom of young ladies in love, &s;he had no confidante, or &s;e|cret-keeper, of her own &s;ex&mdash;in the hou&s;e I mean&mdash;to whom &s;he impart|ed her &s;lame.</P>
<L>"She never told her love,</L>
<L>But let concealment, like a worm o' th' bud,</L>
<L>Feed on her dama&s;k cheek."</L>
<P>To this guarded conduct, perhaps, it was, that Mrs. Darlington her&s;elf did not &s;u&s;pect the attachment; or if &s;he did &s;u&s;pect it, &s;he po&s;&s;ibly tru&s;ted to her niece's &s;uperior ideas, and love of &s;plendour, which &s;he imagined would &s;ave her from any indi&s;cretion.
<PB N="190" REF="205">There is, however, no oppo&s;ing this &s;trange pa&s;&s;ion, again&s;t another. The war is unequal, and if intrieacy and entanglement takes place among the troops of love, the enemy is generally wor&s;ted; ambition it&s;elf is put to flight, and the tender tyrant takes the field. It plainly appeared from this, and many other in&s;tances, that Mi|cia was re&s;olved either to die or con|quer: but alas! with all her vivacity, pride, di&s;dain, and haughty deter|minations, &s;ome deci&s;ive cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ances took place, &s;oon after this, which humbled her &s;pirit, and reduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the &s;ultane&s;s to the &s;lave. But for a re|capitulation of the&s;e matters, intere&s;e|ing as they are, the reader mu&s;t have philo&s;ophy enough to wait, or the &s;kip over &s;ome pages, which, it is
<PB N="191" REF="206">hoped, are not unworthy his peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit here, to mention a piece of literary policy, in not prefix|ing to each of my chapters an abridg|ment of the matter therein contained, in imitation of &s;everal great writers: for, be&s;ides that I take this &s;ort of anticipation to be the way to fore&s;tal the market, it leaves little for the rea|der on which to exerci&s;e his imagi|nation: the charm of &s;urprize is to|tally taken off: he knows, in five lines, what is to be talked over again in as many leaves, and it would be his cheape&s;t way to buy only the table of contents, which is at lea&s;t the cream of the je&s;t, and the mere milk may go to the cat, if it will.</P>
<P>Alicia was one day reading a new romance, to a circle of ladies, who
<PB N="192" REF="207">were working round the fire at their needle: the author informed them only that he begun with chapter the fir&s;t, and courteou&s;ly de&s;ired they would courteou&s;ly read on to chapter the la&s;t. Lord, &s;aid one of the la|dies, what a provoking man this is, we mu&s;t go quite through the book, without kuowing what it is upon. In the middle of the fir&s;t volume, the heroine (as is u&s;ual) was de&s;perately, and (as is u&s;ual) unhappily, in love. Read away, my dear Alicia, cries a &s;prightly la&s;s, I wonder to my &s;oul <HI>what's next.</HI> A few chapters more threw the heroine into &s;uch a criti|cal &s;ituation, that the fair reader and her audience quite raved with impa|tience. One of them caught the book, and began to read at the la&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="208">chapter of the fir&s;t volume; another wanted much to &s;ee how <HI>it ended.</HI> This, however, would not do, they found the author talking of quite a different &s;ubject, and were vexed with them&s;elves to think, that while they were wa&s;ting time in turning over the pages to no purpo&s;e, they might have come to the cri&s;is of the &s;tory they were upon, and got half way into another. This reflection gave them fre&s;h &s;pirits, Alicia began where &s;he left off: the hi&s;tory improved in its progre&s;s, &s;ometimes they left work|ing to laugh, and &s;ometimes to cry; and when they arrived at the la&s;t chapter, like a man who had taken a delightful but too &s;hort a ride, thro' a plea&s;ant and various country, they lamented that it was done, and could wi&s;h to go over the ground again.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="209">For the&s;e rea&s;ons have I avoided the bill of fare, which &s;pecifies not only every di&s;h, but what every di&s;h con|tains. I will make the banquet as plea&s;ant as po&s;&s;ible, but the reader mu&s;t not &s;poil his dinner by a ta&s;te before it is ready, but eat a hearty meal, and take a &s;lice of every thing at table; which I hope he may be able to do without palling his appetite. Let Ali|cia and her pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, amu&s;e them&s;elves together, till it is proper to bring them again upon the &s;cene: at pre&s;ent they make their exit, to intro|duce, what is generally welcome, a new acquaintance.</P>

<P>We were &s;carce &s;eated at breakfa&s;t, when the footman brought in the name of Mr. Draper, and in five &s;e|conds afterwards Mr. Draper made his appearance: and as mirth-in&s;piring a per&s;on he had as ever was exhibited. He looked about thirty, his features were con&s;tantly on the &s;mile; he was inclined to no more than an agreeable corpulency; his eyes were bri&s;k and blue; his complexion fair, almo&s;t to freckles and effeminacy, and his fore|head without a wrinkle: indeed there was no &s;ymptom either of care or cau|tion,
<PB N="212" REF="211">&s;orrow or &s;uffering, about his character. The ea&s;ine&s;s of his man|ner, however, the vivacity of his re|mark, and the complacence of his whole carriage, were &s;o extremely adapted to the moments which are devoted to china and chatter, that he was &s;urely born to be a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to the tea-table&mdash;a cup of him once a day, might be plea&s;ing enough, but, I &s;uppo&s;ed, that if he was to be <HI>taken for a con&s;tancy,</HI> he would have a tendency (like the tea it&s;elf) to create the &s;pleen, demoli&s;h the nerves, and promote the va|pours. He was, in &s;hort, all laugh, loll, and liberty, and I &s;et him down, before he laid his &s;poon acro&s;s the cup, as a mere petit-maitre; in
<PB N="213" REF="212">which conclu&s;ion, I was full as near the truth, as people generally are, who, led away by the glance, are too giddy, or too proud, to imagine they may be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Perhaps, there are a great many ca&s;es where it is quite wrong to be|lieves ones <HI>own eyes;</HI> at lea&s;t, he who|&s;uppo&s;es he can develope the human character, at a &s;ingle view, will have many a mortifying in&s;tance to que&s;|tion his &s;agacity, and often commit blunders, beneath the penetration of a puppy. Mr. Draper was more agreeable than the &s;ugar, and there was really &s;o much cream in his con|ver&s;ation, that our morning's repa&s;t, was unu&s;ually &s;ocial: even Alicia, &s;eemed for a while to forget her Ben|jamin;
<PB N="214" REF="213">Mrs. Darlington &s;miled at as much as &s;he could hear; and I, per|fectly charmed into &s;ilence, con&s;i|dered Mr. Draper, as the mo&s;t enter|taining young man in the whole world. Yes, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, &s;oftly, this is the very acquaintance I want|ed; what a fortunate introduction!&mdash; How ea&s;y he &s;its in his chair! what breeding in his &s;tep, what polite pli|ability in his bow!&mdash;what a flow of words! and what plea&s;antry in his ideas! I &s;uppo&s;e now he is the mo&s;t poli&s;hed character of his age; but I am afraid I make but <HI>a &s;o &s;o</HI> &s;ort of figure be&s;ide him: &s;ome how, or an|other, my hands, are in my way, I &s;carce know what to do with my legs; I can't conceive how I got this
<PB N="215" REF="214">na&s;ty trick of playing with my but|tons; and what the deuce can make me feel ea&s;ier alone, or with Benja|min, than with &s;uch a genteel circle as this before me!&mdash;yet why do I in|dulge the&s;e thoughts? Rome was not built in a day; and I dare &s;ay, it takes &s;ome time to make a man a gentleman! the hour may yet come, when I may be as ea&s;y and affable as Mr. Draper.</P>
<P>Mr. Draper was entering into a &s;pirited burle&s;que on the in&s;ipidity of vi&s;iting parties, and playing with his watch-chain with as much care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s as if he had got the whole conver&s;ation by rote, while I entered into this &s;oliloquy, during which I fixed my eyes directly on the tea|board
<PB N="216" REF="215">in the room; this fit of cogi|tation was &s;oon invaded, by a &s;mart tap on the &s;houlder from Mr. Dra|per, who putting up my reflections to auction, became him&s;elf the fir&s;t bidder, and offered a <HI>penny for my thoughts.</HI> Then came on the &s;ubject of my dre&s;s, (which, by the bye I had not altered), but Draper &s;aid, he would walk with me to his taylor, in the cour&s;e of the excur&s;ion he had in &s;tore for me; not, cries he, that I would have you &s;uppo&s;e I am bigot|ted to frippery, even though you now &s;ee me &s;o APEFIED; but the ridicule of fools, is ten times keener than the cut of a razor; if cu&s;tom bids a man be a monkey, he mu&s;t e'en adopt the character, &s;ir; and I would
<PB N="217" REF="216">either <HI>dre&s;s</HI> or <HI>&s;trip,</HI> rather than be the topic of a moment's titter, to any man breathing. To laugh is exqui|&s;ite, but to be the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of laughter, is to me the agony of the damned. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, therefore, my dear lad, adopt the ab&s;urdity of the times, though it &s;hould command you to wear a doublet of gauze in the winter, and a jerkin of flannel in the dog-days. What &s;ay you, Benignus, &s;hall we move? 'tis too early for the ladies, and we may en|joy many a delicious joke as we go on.</P>
<P>As my cold was much mended, and I admired Mr. Draper, even more than &s;ugar-candy; and as I had be&s;ides an eager curio&s;ity to &s;ee and
<PB N="218" REF="217">know more of his character, I rea|dily embraced his offer, and making our adieu's to the ladies, we walked out of the room like old acquaint|ances, arm in arm together.</P>
