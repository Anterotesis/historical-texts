<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the Writings of Mankind, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, as with their Complexi|ons or their Dre&s;s, each Nation hath a Peculiarity in all the&s;e, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>The Gravity of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the Levity of the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> are as evident in all their Productions as in their Per|&s;ons them&s;elves; and the Stile of my Coun|trymen is as naturally Strong and Nervous, as that of an <HI>Arabian</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> is rich and figurative.</P>
<P>There is an Elegancy and Wildne&s;s of Thought which recommends all their Com|po&s;itions; and our Genius's are as much too cold for the Entertainment of &s;uch Sen|timents, as our Climate is for their Fruits and Spices. If any of the&s;e Beauties are to be found in the following <HI>Eclogues,</HI> I hope my Reader will con&s;ider them as an Argument of their being Original. I re|ceived them at the Hands of a Merchant, who had made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to enrich him|&s;elf
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
with the Learning, as well as the Silks and Carpets of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> The little Infor|mation I could gather concerning their Au|thor, was, That his Name was <HI>Mahamed,</HI> and that he was a Native of <HI>Tauris.</HI></P>
<P>It was in that City that he died of a Di&s;temper fatal in tho&s;e Parts, whil&s;t he was engag'd in celebrating the Victories of his favourite Monarch, <HI>the Great Abbas.</HI> As to the <HI>Eclogues</HI> them&s;elves, they give a very ju&s;t View of the Mi&s;eries, and Incon|veniencies, as well as the Felicities that at|tend one of the fine&s;t Countries in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Time of the Writing them was pro|bably in the Beginning of <HI>Sha Sultan Ho&s;|&s;eyn</HI>'s Reign, the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Sefi</HI> or <HI>Soly|man</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>Whatever Defects, as, I doubt not, there will be many, fall under the Reader's Ob|&s;ervation, I hope his Candour will incline him to make the following Reflections:</P>
<P>That the Works of <HI>Orientals</HI> contain many Peculiarities, and that thro' Defect of Language few <HI>European</HI> Tran&s;lators can do them Ju&s;tice.</P>

<L>Unhappy Land, who&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings tempt the Sword,</L>

<L>No more the Virgins &s;hall delight to rove,</L>

<L>Ye <HI>Georgian</HI> Swains that piteous learn from far</L>

<L>Wild as his Land, in native De&s;erts bred,</L>
