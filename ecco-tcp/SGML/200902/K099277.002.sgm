<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to refu&s;e to the wor|thy Mr. HOMESPUN (who hath, I per|ceive, been obliged to return without his wife) a reque&s;t, which I very plainly &s;ee
<PB N="2" REF="4">
was made to me in the tenderne&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>You do me but ju&s;tice in &s;uppo&s;ing that I will keep your unhappy &s;ecret, as you very properly call it; for it is no &s;mall infelicity to make a &s;ecret of <HI>any</HI> &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary to the fame of a woman, and the peace of a whole family, who&s;e connections would all be di&s;honoured by a <HI>di&s;clo&s;ure</HI> of it.</P>
<P>As far, therefore, as my &s;ilence can contribute to your dome&s;tic tranquility, you may depend upon me; though I cannot but think, &s;he who hath confidence enough to abu&s;e her hu&s;band, &s;hould have policy enough to conceal the particulars of her crime from a confident; &s;ince I know not whether the very knowledge of &s;uch circum&s;tances is not an in&s;ult to her virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">Your poor hu&s;band gave us, ye&s;terday, as u&s;ual, an admirable di&s;cour&s;e, but there was in it &s;ome &s;oftening &s;entiments relating to the pure plea&s;ures of married felicity, which I could not but imagine were &s;ug|ge&s;ted by his own &s;ituation: he loves you, HARRIET, mo&s;t fondly, and I could not avoid giving to &s;entiments, which I con|nected with certain others, the tribute of a tender tear.&mdash;All the pari&s;hioners, and e&s;pecially the talkative part of them, ex|pre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;ome by whi&s;|pers, others by winks, and <HI>all</HI> by looks, that Mrs. HOMESPUN &s;hould continue, where &s;he has neither relations nor ac|quaintances; and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that Mr. HOMESPUN is the only un&s;u&s;picious per&s;on in the village; while <HI>he,</HI> wrapt up in the integrity of his &s;oul, and guarded by his good opinion of <HI>you,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es you
<PB N="4" REF="6">
will &s;oon regret his ab&s;ence, and return to him.</P>
<P>After &s;ervice he drank tea with me, and with tears in his eyes fir&s;t urged my going to BUXTON, and then, (finding my refu|&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hed,) that I &s;hould at lea&s;t try the effect of my entreaties to invite you back: he even went &s;o far as to hint, with all a <HI>father</HI>'s glow upon his cheek, at the little nece&s;&s;ary preparations again&s;t the day in which you are expected to pre|&s;ent him with a te&s;timony of your tender|ne&s;s. There are various maternal cautions, &s;aid he, you know, my dear Mrs. LA MOTTE, to be taken in &s;uch intere&s;ting &s;ituations; and, perhaps, the con&s;tant bu&s;|tles of that watering-place, may for a|while, lull to &s;leep, or rather agitate her into forgetfulne&s;s of tho&s;e cares that ge|nerally alarm the provident apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of <HI>her,</HI> who is, in a <HI>very</HI> few weeks, to be a mother.</P>
<P>This was too powerful a painting: I ro&s;e to conceal my &s;ympathy: he pre&s;&s;ed me by the hand, in vi&s;ible di&s;order, and, prote&s;ting that he left his fate to <HI>my</HI> ma|nagement, &s;aluted me, in his hone&s;t way, and went to perform the la&s;t offices to a poor woman (ALICE WELDON) who died la&s;t Wedne&s;day in child-bed of the babe, who&s;e father is not yet acknowledged. I told your hu&s;band, HARRIET, I would exert my power, without telling him that I had long lo&s;t my influence over you.</P>
<P>As you were not touched by my for|mer letters&mdash;particularly <HI>one</HI> of them&mdash; I de&s;pair of moving you by the pre&s;ent, having no new arguments to offer: nor &s;hould I, indeed, have troubled you at all,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
but that I did it in compliance to your much-injured, and my ever-e&s;teemed friend, Mr. HOMESPUN, whom I admire, chiefly, for the very &s;implicity, to which you have made objection. By the ardour with which he &s;peaks of that Mr. SEDLEY, upon all occa&s;ions, I perceive that you have not been &s;educed by a novice, and yet I can|not po&s;&s;ibly imagine how he has contrived to make the hu&s;band his friend, at the <HI>very</HI> time that he has betrayed the wife into the thorny paths of per&s;onal impu|rity. Be this as it may, he mu&s;t be a very artful creature, and, exclu&s;ively of my not going into the &s;ame lodging with the polluted HARRIET, I would not chu&s;e to lay my&s;elf liable, even to the in&s;ult of being the ridicule of a man, who, doubtle&s;s, <HI>a&s;per&s;es,</HI> even more than he <HI>de|&s;troys.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">It may not, however, be ami&s;s to ob|&s;erve, in the conclu&s;ion of this letter, that, if your return to this place is not &s;peedy, it will probably be attended with con&s;e|quences, which no after-penitence can po&s;|&s;ibly atone for.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. HOMESPUN is extremely ill, and much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by your refu&s;al to return. I have revolved the affair over in my mind, and I &s;ee, that, if you come on the receipt of this letter, very proba|ble excu&s;es may yet be made, and all may be <HI>happy</HI> again.</P>
<P>You are &s;till dear to me, HARRIET, and I wi&s;h for nothing &s;o warmly as to embrace you, to go with you to our ac|cu&s;tomed walk in the meadow, oppo&s;ite

<P>I can no longer be without you; I want you to &s;it by my &s;ide, near your favourite window, round which the je&s;&s;amine clam|bers&mdash;and it is now in full blow&mdash;to work with me, while HORACE reads, as he u&s;ed to do, &s;ome agreeable author.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mrs. HOMESPUN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR hu&s;band is in his bed, brought thither by the evident indiffe|rence of a wife, on whom he doats. What cour&s;e this illne&s;s may take, or where it may end, I know not: the people here, however, do not &s;cruple to attribute it to the ab&s;ence and &s;trange conduct of Mrs. HOMESPUN.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXII.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>DELIA DELMORE</HI> to Lady <HI>LUCY SAXBY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FANNY is not wor&s;e, and there|fore my &s;pirits (which always ri&s;e and fall with the pains and plea&s;ures of my friends) are equal to the delightful ta&s;k of corre&s;|ponding with my very dear Lady LUCY.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t I only &s;lightly, and in ge|neral terms, mentioned the patrons of my happine&s;s: let me now become particular. My father has formed him&s;elf by &s;uch a &s;tandard, that his excellencies have a dig|nity peculiar to the dignity of his man|ners. He hath ever thought proper to include the friendly in the paternal cha|racter;
<PB N="13" REF="15">
and he inculcates, even to the lowe&s;t dome&s;tics, a certain &s;en&s;e of inde|pendency; a principle, he &s;ays, nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained even in &s;ervitude, and from which branches forth a thou&s;and vir|tues. In &s;ociety, &s;ays Sir HENRY, &s;ubor|dination is certainly indi&s;pen&s;ible, accord|ing to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem; but then it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the balance of human affairs is oftener, much more level than we imagine. If <HI>we</HI> feed the poor, it is their labour that accommodates <HI>us:</HI> if we pay them for their toil, it is that <HI>very</HI> toil to which we are indebted for all the &s;oftne&s;&s;es of pro&s;perity: and if we pro|vide them with a defence again&s;t the &s;e|verity of &s;ea&s;ons, and a chamber for the convenience of their repo&s;e, (after they have wearied out their vigour in our &s;er|vice,) it may be remembered, that, in gra|titude for our attention, it is to them we are indebted for every thing that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
<PB N="14" REF="16">
riches from poverty: to their hands we owe the delicacies of the garden&mdash;the trea&s;ures of the field&mdash;the decorations of the man&s;ion&mdash;the table of plenty&mdash;the robe of luxury&mdash;and the bed of down.</P>
<P>Acting upon &s;uch &s;ingularly-noble mo|tives, Sir HENRY, at a proper cri&s;is, makes each of his children, in &s;ome &s;ort, independent&mdash;that is, my dear, he allots to each of us &s;uch a &s;hare of fortune in our own hands as is &s;ufficient to the di&s;|play and &s;hew-off of the natural di&s;po&s;i|tion. He e&s;teems it nece&s;&s;ary to know the operation of the temper, when it has power to play; this&mdash;&s;ays he&mdash;is <HI>not</HI> to be known by the common mode of con|tracting, but of extending: it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to di&s;cover any natural propen&s;ity, un|til opportunity gives liberty to all the lit|tle pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;tripling, and indul|gence gives way to un&s;hackled inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">Educated under &s;uch advantages, and the finer poli&s;hes of the &s;chool given by a father &s;o venerable and &s;uperior; the youthful independent will not turn his ho|nours, and the precious depo&s;it entru&s;ted to him, to abu&s;e: and, if he does, even then there are many ways which Sir HEN|RY has di&s;covered to turn his deviating conduct into the proper channel. From kindne&s;s like this, Lady LUCY, we are enabled to do namele&s;s occa&s;ional little &s;er|vices for the unfortunate; and by &s;uch means learn early to form our&s;elves into habits of &s;ympathy and tenderheartedne&s;s. I do not put gold into your pur&s;es, chil|dren, like &s;ome parents, who promi&s;e to double the &s;um if you &s;hew it unbroken, and undimini&s;hed at a future period: I do not give it you to hoard up like mi&s;ers, nor di&s;&s;ipate like little &s;pendthrifts; but I give it you on purpo&s;e to change into &s;mall &s;ilver: it is my de&s;ire that you
<PB N="16" REF="18">
&s;hould ta&s;te early the fir&s;t of plea&s;ures: look about you: it is a world of mi&s;ery, as well as impo&s;ition: mark your objects to the be&s;t of your abilities&mdash;be deceived as little as po&s;&s;ible, and double your trea|&s;ure by decrea&s;ing it: for &s;ix-penny worth of &s;ilver, gain &s;ixty moments of fair re|flection: for the banquet at &s;o cheap a rate provided to another&mdash;the bread and water of gratitude&mdash;take in exchange the richer fea&s;t of a kind heart: and in this ca&s;e, my dear children, which is the greate&s;t gainer? If you mu&s;t be u&s;urers, put your money out to &s;uch intere&s;t; be ambitious of laying it wi&s;ely out in the purcha&s;e of virtue, and I will &s;upply you chearfully with the means.</P>
<P>We were all walking, LUCY, the other morning, by the &s;ide of the bath, when a &s;hort, bold, &s;turdy-looking fellow ac|co&s;ted us for charity. We looked at Sir
<PB N="17" REF="19">
HENRY for our cue: Come along, chil|dren, &s;aid he, that man is both impudent and able. As we pa&s;&s;ed by, the fellow drew up his mouth, and &s;haking a little dirty bag that he took from his pouch, gingled it over his head, and &s;napt his fingers. When we were at &s;ome di&s;tance&mdash;Take care, dear children, of &s;uch impo&s;tors: be&s;tow not the moment you are &s;upplicated: try the temper of the petitioner: he whom indigence, and the &s;trokes of ill-fortune have not at lea&s;t humiliated, is not yet an object of your genero&s;ity. As we were going to our carriage, a decayed veteran, in tattered regimentals, reduced to the knees by the perils of his profe&s;&s;ion, was endeavouring to &s;weep our way with his hat: little CHARLES ran, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, and gave his bounty. Yes, &s;aid Sir HENRY, there, my dear lad, you could not be deceived: by whatever means
<PB N="18" REF="20">
brought about, &s;uch a poor wretch mu&s;t be the mark of liberality.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite, LUCY, to the maxims of the pre&s;ent age, thus do our parents encourage us in proportion, as we have conduced to the happine&s;s of others; and for every trifle well-be&s;towed, we are rewarded with a pre&s;ent four-fold its value, and that, again, enriched by a &s;mile that &s;hews how &s;trongly the goodne&s;s of the child vibrates on the &s;en&s;ibility of the relation.</P>
<P>It is another happine&s;s peculiar to the retreat of Sir HENRY DELMORE, that none of its re&s;idents are fired by the envy of oppo&s;ition, or the meane&s;&s;es of jealou|&s;y: &s;o far the rever&s;e of this, that one is &s;tudious to compliment the other on &s;ome excellence fre&s;h acquired, or more per|fected: &s;ome di&s;play of the heart, newly
<PB N="19" REF="21">
di&s;covered, or &s;ome additional grace of the per&s;on that blooms in the blu&s;h, &s;par|kles in the eye, or dimples in the &s;mile.</P>
<P>What, my dear Lucy, can we &s;ay to tho&s;e who&s;e hearts, repugnant to &s;uch prin|ciples, turn a deaf ear to the mu&s;ic of dome&s;tic concord? Earthly, groveling crea|tures, how I pity them! Warm, how|ever, and alive to this &s;weete&s;t harmony, is my elegant Lady SAXBY; &s;he feels the &s;oft impre&s;&s;ion that is made in every finer bo&s;om by the hand of a divinity.

<P>I SHOULD ill de&s;erve the kind|ne&s;&s;es you have been plea&s;ed to confer up|on me, did I refu&s;e the earlie&s;t acknow|ledgment. I am truly glad to hear Mrs. MORTIMER is likely to recover, and that you have found &s;uch a retreat as is agree|able to your family, contiguous to the bath.</P>
<P>Ah! Mi&s;s DELMORE, what pictures have you drawn&mdash;happy friend&mdash;enviable DELIA! and yet &s;till, methinks, is there wanting one article&mdash;one principal figure, to compleat your fine and high-coloured

family-piece. Why, my dear girl, &s;o for|getful of your&s;elf? Great, as are your pre|&s;ent felicities, I am per&s;uaded they admit addition. There is a pa&s;&s;ion, my DELIA, that gives the la&s;t fine fini&s;h to the bli&s;s of an innocent life: it is the animator of every other happine&s;s; and I am &s;urpri&s;ed that a heart &s;o gentle as Mi&s;s DELMORE'S &s;hould &s;o long remain unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. The plea&s;ures of a pure and mutual pa&s;&s;ion would not be unworthy her attention.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the various characters in your train of &s;laves, DELIA, is there not one that can attract you? Hard-hearted girl, how &s;hall we contrive to captivate you? Surely you terrify the tribe of humble &s;er|vants! A modern lover, who has &s;tudied only his rotine of rhap&s;ody, and who de|pends on the repetition, and arrangement of a certain number of warm words&mdash;his
<PB N="22" REF="24">
flames and fires, hearts and darts, thrills and hills, groves and loves, Cupids and &s;tupids&mdash;has no &s;ort of chance; but when he has rung the changes and chimes till he can do nothing but ring them over again, he is quite at a &s;tand, can go no farther, and is lo&s;t in his own ab&s;urdity, feels his own in&s;ignificance, and makes his ridiculous exit. Will you, however, <HI>ne|ver</HI> be caught?</P>
<P>If the rocks of BUXTON are too barren, pray ha&s;ten to your Worce&s;ter&s;hire para|di&s;e: your gardens there&mdash;the ancient &s;eat of the DELMORE'S&mdash;contain every thing au&s;picious to the <HI>belle pa&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;You have thickets of ro&s;es, which may furni&s;h your &s;ighers with &s;imilies, and abundance of bowers, where Cupid may repo&s;e on vio|lets: you have beds of primro&s;es to en|tertain the Silphids, velvet verdure for the

dancing fairies, and lucid water, wherein Venus may bathe her&s;elf in brooks&mdash;But &mdash;I am mi&s;taken, if you now need this poetical Arcadia. BUXTON rocks have their beauties&mdash;pray, my dear, let me hear more of this gentleman of birth, rank, and character&mdash;this di&s;tingui&s;hed he, who&s;e conver&s;ation is &s;o plea&s;ing, in&s;tructive, and various; who, at fir&s;t &s;ight, hath all the ea&s;e, firmne&s;s, and unembarra&s;&s;ed air of an old acquaintance, and who pre&s;ents him&s;elf &s;o engaging to a company?

<P>OH! THORNTON, I wi&s;hed for difficulties, and they are come pouring upon me with a vengeance. I am ab&s;o|lutely hemmed in by embara&s;&s;ments: at this moment I am between a SCYLLA and a CHARYBDIS, and uncommonly &s;kilful mu&s;t be my piloti&s;m, or I mu&s;t &s;plit up|on the rocks and be wrecked for ever, Never was I, &s;ince I &s;et out a knight-errant to fight the world behind my more than &s;even-folded &s;hield of di&s;&s;imulation, &s;o truly in danger of being di&s;covered; and thou knowe&s;t it is with me, as with what the world calls a much better man,

But, to come to the point, THORNTON, I am almo&s;t at the end of my wits. HO|RACE HOMESPUN pines for his ab&s;ent mate. Mrs. LA MOTTE refu&s;es to come down; and urges HARRIET to return upon peril of in&s;tant di&s;covery.

Oh! that women could learn, like me, to gratify the pa&s;&s;ion of the hour, and think no more of it: but there is no &s;educing a woman into plea&s;ure, but &s;he is &s;o cur&s;edly grateful, as to hug the &s;e|ducer for ever after, without any regard to time or to place.

<P>GUESS how ea&s;ily your former favour &s;at upon my heart, by my readine&s;s to receive from you another! I had more rea&s;ons than you yet know of for inviting you to my villa, and it was tho&s;e rea&s;ons that prevented me from inviting my SO|PHIA to partake of the excur&s;ion.

I have lately had offers of prefer|ment&mdash;To &s;peak openly, I can have the command of a company, upon joining

The half-pay of a Lieutenant, you know, Sir, is not &s;ufficient to, even a man of modera|tion: my wife's private fortune I have very &s;trictly &s;ettled upon her&s;elf, as a &s;ort of comfortable &s;ecurity again&s;t unfortunate contingencies: I think my&s;elf no more entitled to touch the intere&s;t of this, than I would infringe upon a property in tru&s;t, which, after my decea&s;e, was to be the only certain re&s;ource of the per&s;on under my guardian&s;hip. Another point is, my own thir&s;t of glory. I was trained very early to the exerci&s;e of arms, and although I continued to &s;tarve upon my en&s;igncy for near twenty years&mdash;(I weep with joy, Sir, when I think upon the generous means by which I became a Lieutenant)&mdash;yet the ardours of military ambition are by no means extingui&s;hed. I declare to you, Mr. THORNTON, even ble&s;t as I now am
<PB N="52" REF="54">
in a competent income, pre&s;ented to me with the hand of SOPHIA&mdash;in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, too, of SOPHIA her&s;elf&mdash;I can|not, even at this time, hear the beat of a drum without feeling my heart bound at the alarm. In a word, I de&s;ign to go to the field, and accept the promotion. I am one of tho&s;e who &s;ide with that party which con&s;iders the dignity of Britain in|&s;ulted by America. I was bred a &s;oldier, and taught even from my cradle (for my father had won his laurels) to feel all the delicacies of martial maje&s;ty. In my opi|nion, Sir, the Sovereign of the&s;e realms is injured: his injuries are mine: it is enough for a &s;oldier to believe his cau&s;e is ju&s;t. I perceive many of my old comrades have voluntarily drawn the &s;word, while mine is gathering ru&s;t in its &s;heath. I drew it, Mr. THORNTON, la&s;t night, out of the &s;cabbard, and upon examining the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
blade I &s;aw a &s;pot, a lazy &s;pot of inacti|vity, de&s;troying the noble keenne&s;s of its edge.

But, fie upon it! fie upon it! 'twas the infir|mity but of a moment: "I am a man again." In &s;hort, Sir, my wife knows nothing of my intention, and <HI>I</HI> do not know how to break the matter to her. She has peculiar gentlene&s;s of heart, and will, I am convinced, feel the &s;evere&s;t

The wor&s;t of it is, Mr. THORNTON, women are &s;o apt to a&s;&s;ociate, with the duty of a &s;oldier, &s;uch horrid ideas of death, broken bones, groans, and cannon-balls, that they give a man over the moment he marches from their embraces to front the enemies of their country: however, let us not blame the &s;oftne&s;s that was de&s;igned to &s;oothe us, to poli&s;h our ruggedne&s;s, and harmoni&s;e our natures.

Pray call to mind with how much ardour we followed HEC|TOR to the field; how we de&s;pi&s;ed the pu&s;illanimous, hare-hearted PARIS; and though we pitied the drooping ANDRO|MACHE&mdash;though we wept over her woes&mdash;yet we &s;hould have felt for her &s;till more, had &s;he not endeavoured to detain the

warrior from his duty. Nor can you help recollecting with how much plea&s;ure&mdash;a plea&s;ure that was radiant in your dear eyes, SOPHIA&mdash;you heard of the various victo|ries atchieved and related by the narrative NESTOR: of his triumphant returns to his native country after the laurels of conque&s;t were waving in his helmet, while the patriotic virgins were &s;cattering in his path the incen&s;e of the Spring, and the emulous youths bowed to the victor, and &s;ang the &s;ong of &s;ucce&s;s before him. Before we had reached the Twelfth Book, you was half a hero, and, with the &s;hield and buckler of MINERVA (her <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> is already in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion), you would now be fit to take the field, arrange the file, and in&s;pirit at once by your courage and beauty, the &s;oldiers of your <HI>own</HI> CAE|SAR. Do you know, SOPHY, that I am child enough to be vain of the name that
<PB N="60" REF="62">

SOPHIA, I am only a di&s;banded, unemployed Lieutenant, and the little glory that I gained in the field in the days of my youth, is now entirely faded; and, without one mark of the &s;word&mdash;without one <HI>apologizing</HI> &s;car, by which might be &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of re|treat, I am withering in the eye of my King and country, and &s;hall after a few years fall into an inglorious grave, and be no more remembered.</P>
<P>At a villa in SUSSEX, through which I pa&s;&s;ed, and where I &s;topt to dine, I was told of a man&s;ion, which &s;trangers u&s;ually went to &s;urvey, the property of a veteran officer, whom I fought with, &s;ide by &s;ide,
<PB N="61" REF="63">
in the fir&s;t battle that fle&s;hed my arm: I have a thou&s;and times mentioned him to you, under the well-known name of FRASER. The old man hath left two of his limbs in different parts of the globe: FRANCE hath the honour of his arm, and his right leg adorns the plains of MINDEN: but the trunk is whole, and &s;eems to have acquired fre&s;h vigour from lopping the branches. Hardihood hath &s;ettled the ro&s;e of high health in his cheek; the &s;un hath &s;ea&s;oned his complexion to the heat of the Torrid Zone; and the hair of his head is like the whitene&s;s of a hermit's beard, that &s;preads it&s;elf beyond the girdle. He knew me at the fir&s;t &s;ight, and pre&s;&s;ed my hand with an hone&s;t roughne&s;s that denoted &s;incerity:&mdash;but on &s;eeing me &s;till <HI>able,</HI> and in the force of youth, at lea&s;t of middle age, he contracted his brow, and &s;eemed to a&s;k me, by his look, what
<PB N="62" REF="64">
I did ba&s;king here at home? In the en|thu&s;ia&s;m of his martial veneration, which ri&s;es to every thing but idolatry, he hath at his own expence erected in his garden little monumental ornaments to the me|mory of his favourite heroes. BRITANNIA was on one &s;ide, weeping over WOLFE; and on the other, the figure of PUBLIC TRANQUILITY offering the olive-branch to CUMBERLAND. Not a warrior of any celebrity but had at lea&s;t a bu&s;t, a pede&s;|tal, or an in&s;cription. And upon my taking notice of a vacant nich in the cen|ter of the garden, the Major &s;truck it with his cane, and exclaimed, In the name of Honour, VERNON, why wilt thou not give an old friend the opportunity to fill this gap of glory with <HI>another</HI> of the CAESARS? I felt at this in&s;tant, SOPHY, a flu&s;h in my cheeks, and, as we returned together into his hou&s;e (which is in the ta&s;te of forti|fications),
<PB N="63" REF="65">

I di&s;patched HARRIET to the langui&s;hing pedant; but &s;he had &s;carce got, as I un|der&s;tand, five miles on her way, when the cur&s;ed po&s;tilion, willing to &s;hew his dex|terity (according to their villainous cu&s;tom) by driving like a devil through the village, at a &s;hort turn, or rather angle in the road, overturned the chai&s;e, fell him&s;elf from the &s;addle, and &s;et the hor&s;es a-go|ing, while the poor HARRIET was dragged along the earth, with her body half out of the chai&s;e-window, till a countryman caught the off hor&s;e by the bridle, and put a &s;top to the career. She was carried into a little dirty-looking inn, almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s; and, as &s;he informs me, with an arm torn by the gla&s;s, which was un|fortunately drawn up, &s;cribbled an almo&s;t unintelligible line to reque&s;t I would ha&s;ten to &s;ee her before &s;he died. The po&s;tboy brought me the note, trembling like a leaf, and white as a &s;hirt, prote&s;ting mo&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="69">
fervently that he could not help the acci|dent. I knew not what to do: I he&s;i|tated&mdash;dreaded the con&s;equence&mdash;wrote a hurried line to poor HORACE, without feeling either the pen or paper&mdash;called for a taper without thinking that I wanted wax&mdash;&s;ent it to the po&s;t by the boy&mdash;and then ordered my hor&s;es. The cur&s;ed land|lord, who is ever alarmed at the &s;ound of a hoof, in the expectation of fre&s;h prey, now detected my di&s;order, and &s;et every wheel at work to find out the cau&s;e: "He was &s;orely &s;orry to &s;ee me unea&s;y; would do any thing in his power; hoped nothing material was the matter&mdash;Could he do any thing?&mdash;he was concerned to &s;ee me in &s;uch confu&s;ion&mdash;would do a great deal to &s;erve &s;o worthy a gentleman&mdash;<HI>mahap</HI> I was taken ill&mdash;mahap my friends <HI>was</HI> &s;ick in LONDON&mdash;my wife&mdash;my aunt&mdash;my uncle &mdash;Some law-&s;uit, <HI>may be,</HI> had gone wrong, or <HI>&s;ommut</HI> or other was mo&s;t <HI>&s;artinly</HI> the

<P>In &s;hort, THORNTON, I was obliged to e&s;|cape <HI>him</HI> and my ri&s;ing rage by ru&s;hing into a little &s;lip of ground behind his hou&s;e, where, under pretence of picking a few pinks that &s;traggled poverty-&s;truck about the beds, I ca&s;t about what was to be done. In this manner I argued with my&s;elf: If I go to HARRIET, the affair will certainly be &s;u&s;pected: for how came I &s;o intere&s;ted in this lady's misfortune! If I do <HI>not</HI> go, it will be barbarous&mdash;but then I have &s;ent to her hu&s;band, and home is the be&s;t and fitte&s;t place for a &s;ick woman.&mdash;Upon the whole, I thought it not proper or political
<PB N="69" REF="71">
to go; and, as to writing, I dare not give way to my &s;entiments, for a di&s;covered letter is irrecoverable perdition. Upon my return into the hou&s;e, I found the ra&s;cally landlord tampering for intelligence with the po&s;tboy, who had come upon the &s;ad|dle-hor&s;e, with the tangled traces &s;till about his back&mdash;I had well nigh broke out again. THOMAS, who &s;tays with me, although married, till I can &s;uit my&s;elf, looked as if he &s;u&s;pected the matter&mdash;the landlord muttered forth a million pities, and talked of our being all mortal, and liable to ac|cidents&mdash;the po&s;tboy &s;aid his hor&s;es were out, as I &s;aw, all to pieces, and his chai&s;e &s;hattered in the pannels.</P>
<P>I could STANHOPE it no longer: Cur&s;e your hor&s;es, chai&s;e, and pannels, all toge|ther! &s;aid I&mdash;get out of my &s;ight, and leave me to my&s;elf: a lady is dying, and you are prating about your damn'd pan|nels

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN addre&s;s from me, under my peculiar &s;ituation, will no doubt alarm you: but forms and ceremonies mu&s;t all yield to irre&s;i&s;tible exigences. I find it nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of my mind to write to you. The accident, Sir, that brought us together at SCARBOROUGH, when your vi&s;its to me were very frequent, and, as a &s;ingle woman, I confe&s;s not di&s;agreeable, is recollected with &s;ome anxiety. You were then at &s;ome pains to convince me I had made an impre&s;&s;ion on your &s;en|&s;ibility,
<PB N="79" REF="81">
and certain &s;entiments were inter|changed, which it would be, at this pe|riod, highly improper to repeat. It may not be ami&s;s, however, to ob&s;erve that, prior to your quitting SCARBOROUGH, you did not omit exerting your utmo&s;t talents (and they are not incon&s;iderable, Mr. SED|LEY) to engage my heart. How far you &s;ucceeded, it is not <HI>now</HI> material to en|quire. Be that as it may, my health hath been gradually upon the decline from that hour to this. It is now &s;ome months &s;ince I gave my hand to Mr. MOR|TIMER, than whom there never lived a better character, or a tenderer hu&s;band. He was educated under the eye of my father, who &s;eemed &s;o wrapt up in the ideas of making him &s;till nearer to his fa|mily, that, as he thought proper to ad|dre&s;s me, I could not deny to duty, what po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hould have refu&s;ed to every thing el&s;e. In a word, Sir, my worthy father's
<PB N="80" REF="82">
heart was in the match, and it is impo&s;|&s;ible for a child to di&s;appoint the wi&s;hes of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a parent. The &s;oftne&s;s, delicacy, and gentlene&s;s of Mr. MORTIMER'S beha|viour has ever been uniform and exact: and although it has plea&s;ed Heaven to continue my indi&s;po&s;ition, and indeed ra|ther to increa&s;e than abate it, yet he has not &s;uffered my languor to relax his animated a&s;&s;iduities, but has acted, both by day and by night, the double part of nur&s;e and hu&s;|band. Peculiarly unlucky do I account the de&s;tiny by which you and I, Sir, meet again: not that I have the lea&s;t traces of affection for your per&s;on, being really at|tached to Mr. MORTIMER by duty, and upon principle. At the &s;ame time, Sir, I cannot but own, your pre&s;ence gives me unea&s;ine&s;s, and unea&s;ine&s;s of any kind I am not now equal to. You have, I &s;ee, recommended your&s;elf to my father more warmly than ever; my &s;i&s;ter thinks very
<PB N="81" REF="83">
highly of you; Mr. MORTIMER is loud in your prai&s;es; and even my mother, who is not ea&s;ily attracted, &s;peaks of you with ardour. As my &s;ituation is &s;ufficient|ly &s;acred to exclude every po&s;&s;ible hope, nay, as I dare pre&s;ume your own con|nexions have, by this time, led your incli|nations into a more proper channel, I will venture to talk to you with the freedom of a friend. To &s;peak plainly then, Mr. SEDLEY, there is a point in which you may &s;till oblige me&mdash;it is this: that you would enter as &s;eldom into this hou&s;e as is con&s;i&s;tent with a re&s;olution, which I earne&s;tly beg you will take, of withdraw|ing your&s;elf from this family.&mdash;Do it lei|&s;urely, but at all events let it be done. Ah! Mr. SEDLEY, pity the perturbation of an unea&s;y mind. Before you came, I could at lea&s;t conceal agitation, and &s;ub|mit to the &s;ilent depredations of my di&s;|temper. Every tear I then &s;hed&mdash;every
<PB N="82" REF="84">
&s;igh that then &s;tole from me&mdash;was attri|buted to the unavoidable ri&s;ings and &s;ink|ings of a con&s;umptive habit. But within the&s;e few days I have had &s;ome conflicts, and every one of them adds to my weak|ne&s;s, to hide&mdash;a &s;omething that preys upon my heart. To account to you for this is needle&s;s. If you have the lea&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion that it is occa&s;ioned by your appearance, let it intere&s;t your humanity&mdash;your ho|nour&mdash;your compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;in my cau&s;e; and do not, Mr. SEDLEY, render more exqui&s;itely wretched the la&s;t hours of a fate at the be&s;t unenviable, and not &s;u&s;tained without a &s;orrow that is ha&s;tening its ob|ject to the tomb. Go, then, I conjure you. Leave me to the protection of a ge|nerous family&mdash;of a dear &s;i&s;ter&mdash;of a fond hu&s;band. It is not&mdash;I <HI>feel</HI> it is not po&s;&s;i|ble that I &s;hould long live among&s;t them. Let me not &s;hew Mr. MORTIMER that I gave my&s;elf to him as to the friend and

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXXXII.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>DELIA DELMORE</HI> to Lady <HI>LUCY SAXBY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY moment in the day af|fords &s;ome fre&s;h and beautiful in&s;tance of my noble father's wi&s;dom and affection. About an hour after tea this evening, while Sir HENRY was enjoying his &s;erene &s;ummer-walk, as he calls it, WILLIAM brought a pencil'd card, and delivered it to me. It was to advi&s;e with <HI>him</HI> (Sir HENRY) about &s;ome concerns e&s;&s;ential to the general welfare. Even my little bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter, Charles and Caroline, (who are down with us,) were mentioned in this invitation: the card reque&s;ted the com|pany of all the family, adding, that, as
<PB N="97" REF="99">
the evening was delightful, his mind com|po&s;ed, and nobody but our&s;elves, at pre|&s;ent, in the hou&s;e, he much de&s;ired that we might all have our &s;hare in the ge|neral &s;erenity. How prettily, my dear LUCY, how per&s;ua&s;ively this exalted pa|rent propo&s;es, as a plea&s;ure, what his au|thority might command as a duty? But it is among the number of his excellent maxims, that none but froward &s;pirits do well with compul&s;ion, and that a frank and ingenuous tenderne&s;s hath in it equal weight and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation pa&s;t in the garden, under the &s;hade of hawthorns, laurels, and filberts: there is a white bench under it; and a &s;ort of natural arching, bower-fa&s;hion, made by the mixture of thick leaves and branches interwoven above. Hither we came in obedience to the &s;um|mons: a group of relations loving and
<PB N="98" REF="100">
beloved. FANNY, who had been amu&s;ing her&s;elf with the pen, (not having had &s;trength for the plea&s;ures of writing for &s;ome time,) came forward, delicate as an|gel meekne&s;s, with her young brother in one hand, and her little &s;i&s;ter in the other. VENUS, with two of her attendant Graces, could not be more lovely, even though the di&s;tre&s;s of ill-heath threw &s;omewhat of languor into her air; but then it was a languor &s;o &s;oft, and a di&s;tre&s;s &s;o gentle, that it only &s;erved the more to <HI>feminize</HI> (if you'll allow the word), and to recom|mend her to the &s;pectator as a more pathe|tic, intere&s;ting figure.</P>
<P>Sir HENRY was at fir&s;t &s;itting &s;ome|what pen&s;ively, with an opened letter in his hand&mdash;my mother by his &s;ide, lean|ing her arm on one of the corners of the bench, and repo&s;ing her cheek within her hand&mdash;the true po&s;ture of meditation.
<PB N="99" REF="101">
They both ro&s;e at our approach. Mr. MORTIMER and I went up fir&s;t; then FANNY, and her twin cherubs: we were a little alarmed, but this was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated by Sir HENRY, who, &s;eating us all on the bench, drew a green garden-chair from an adjoining &s;hade, placing him|&s;elf oppo&s;ite to us, and, with a &s;mile of ineffable benignity, in which the pa|rent and the friend &s;hone beautifully blended, he paid each of us a varied compliment, on our obedience to his wi&s;hes, and addre&s;&s;ed us to this effect:</P>
<P>"I have reque&s;ted your company, my dear and worthy children, to engage your filial attention on &s;everal of the mo&s;t im|portant events of human life: I have, in|deed, for &s;ome time, had a de&s;ign to &s;um|mon you together on this &s;ubject, but care, company, and amu&s;ement, have thrown their attractions or interruptions hitherto
<PB N="100" REF="102">
in the way of my wi&s;hes. I have, how|ever, fixt upon this evening of lei&s;ure to deliver to you the &s;ecrets of my heart, and in mine are included tho&s;e of the be&s;t of wives, and tendere&s;t of mothers."</P>
<P>Lady DELMORE drew her &s;pread fingers acro&s;s her face, and Sir HENRY repeating his panegyric, went on:</P>
<P>"I am happy, my dear relatives, to tell you in the fir&s;t place&mdash;and let that &s;erve as an encouragement to you&mdash;that I can look back upon a life of more than three|&s;core years, with a tranquility of retro|&s;pect, at the &s;ame time &s;incere, chri&s;tian, and philo&s;ophic. The &s;erenity of my &s;oul is in no degree wounded by the critici&s;m with which I review its conduct through the perilous voyage of my life, in which, by the care of Heaven, I have e&s;caped tho&s;e quick&s;ands that endanger our youth,
<PB N="101" REF="103">
and tho&s;e rocks which alarm us in age. But that which I account far the riche&s;t indulgence of Providence, is that dear pro|&s;pect which I now behold in the per&s;ons of this beauteous circle&mdash;a circle filled with the pledges of this generous creature's invariable fidelity, and the te&s;timonies of my continent attachment to excellence &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed."</P>
<P>My mother ro&s;e, LUCY, gave her hand to Sir HENRY, looked at him a moment&mdash; looked at him blooming even in age&mdash; &s;ighed &s;oftly, and returned to her &s;eat.</P>
<P>Sir HENRY proceeded:</P>
<P>"The &s;ea&s;on of infancy is pa&s;t with mo&s;t of you; and its plea&s;ures are &s;ucceeded by reflections of a higher nature. Even this &s;weet pair&mdash;<HI>(here he pointed to my young brother and &s;i&s;ter)</HI>&mdash;are at the age
<PB N="102" REF="104">
of di&s;tingui&s;hing, and the re&s;t are mature. The blo&s;&s;oms of youth promi&s;e a generous fruitage. You, DELIA, have not yet been rewarded by the tenderne&s;s of &s;uch a man as my MORTIMER: yet the colour of your life will depend on the exchange of your name. Your mother's expectations, like mine, are &s;anguine, and exten&s;ive: our eyes are turned on your every action&mdash; We hope to &s;ee you all the &s;upports of our declining age: our &s;un is about to &s;et, and we wi&s;h its departure may be gilded by your virtues and indulgences.</P>
<P>"The father of a family is at once a &s;ublime and venerable character. My full heart dilates as I &s;ee my&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed by the&s;e charming portraits of our&s;elves."</P>
<P>Here Lady DELMORE melted into tears of tran&s;port, but endeavoured to conceal them.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">"I can form to my&s;elf (continued my fa|ther) no ideas beyond it, nor many equal. Our family is at pre&s;ent the &s;eat of inte|grity, unanimity, and mutual confidence. Our plea&s;ures are reflected upon each other, and we reciprocally give and receive ini|mitable complacence. Yet we mu&s;t be alarmed for tho&s;e we love. Though the tenour of your conduct, and the gratitude of your tempers, make us le&s;s fearful of deviation, and though the maxims we have ever been indu&s;trious to inculcate make us more &s;ecure and inapprehen&s;ive, yet certain tremors will inevitably touch the bo&s;om of a parent: be not di&s;plea&s;ed, therefore, my children, if I give you a few general precepts, for your e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and adoption. They come &s;anctified to you with the venerable imprimatur of more than fifty years experience. The maxims which are nece&s;&s;ary to regulate an
<PB N="104" REF="106">
ingenuous mind are neither multiplied nor intricate. The very corner-&s;tone of a great character is a clear con&s;cience: if you feel well, you will act well: and if you do not, all the talents in the world will only &s;erve to torment you. Never wear a ma&s;k before your motives, but when it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the felicity of life, &s;uch as deceiving, or rather bewitching, the unprincipled into virtue: &s;ome tempers cannot bear the plain Truth; &s;he is too aweful for them: be it then, in &s;uch par|ticular ca&s;es, your parts, to lead them to her &s;acred temple by the mo&s;t plea&s;ing paths&mdash;Alleviate the apparent ruggedne&s;s, and length of the way, by &s;uch meanders as, though they &s;eem to deviate, may a&s;|&s;uredly bring you by the faire&s;t pro&s;pects to the &s;hrine of the Godde&s;s.&mdash;I have no objection to your adorning your&s;elves with all the attractions of exterior, &s;uch I mean
<PB N="105" REF="107">
as are reflected upon the character from dignity of manner, per&s;ua&s;ion of voice, &s;plendor of addre&s;s, and elegance of air:
<Q>Where virtue is, the&s;e are mo&s;t virtuous.</Q>
They will act like magic, and make the innocence both of your &s;entiment, and example, perfectly irre&s;i&s;tible; and I be|&s;eech you to exert them in the cau&s;e of that truth and &s;obriety of heart I have re|commended.&mdash;Make u&s;e of them to con|ciliate differences, to in&s;pirit &s;ociety, to embelli&s;h conver&s;ation, to &s;often the har&s;h|ne&s;s of di&s;pute, to animate attention; to plea&s;e, to in&s;truct, to entertain. To all the&s;e purpo&s;es they will be excellent, and ornamental. But beware of what a licen|tious and artful indulgence of them may po&s;&s;ibly lead to&mdash;beware of DUPLICITY; of <HI>that</HI> duplicity, which, &s;o accoutered, &mdash;its de&s;tructive &s;word &s;heathed in polite|ne&s;s&mdash;its heart &s;hielded by the impenetrable
<PB N="106" REF="108">
mail of gilded hypocri&s;y,&mdash;is equal to the &s;iege of a city, and might do more real <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> than all the efforts of a legion of avowed villanies. Of all earthly things, therefore, mo&s;t dete&s;t, what is mo&s;t to be dreaded, the &s;y&s;tem of a well-bred, high-poli&s;hed, elegant deceiver: no eye can &s;ee him: no under&s;tanding detect him: no policy e&s;cape him. He comes in the form of a Seraph, and tho&s;e who are them&s;elves hone&s;t, cannot imagine that he is a Syren.</P>
<P>"At your time of life it is hard, extreme|ly hard, to ma&s;ter the predominant incli|nation; yet virtuous exerci&s;e will habituate the &s;oul to the practice of uniform honour. To you, DELIA, I am now going to &s;peak more particularly:&mdash;There is a pa&s;&s;ion, which, rightly directed, is the &s;ource of every noble and genuine greatne&s;s.

<P>"Unadulterated as yet by the &s;malle&s;t commerce with dexterous di&s;&s;imulation, pardon my alarms le&s;t your innocence and &s;implicity &s;hould be the means of your misfortune.&mdash;That DISSIMULATION, which, under the fair di&s;gui&s;e of attracting ele|gance, led forward by the Graces, cannot be detected, even at noon-day, is for ever on the watch; and I know nothing &s;o dange|rous as yielding too ea&s;ily to the tenderne&s;s of a new-born pa&s;&s;ion. Do not, however,
<PB N="108" REF="110">
mi&s;take me: my &s;y&s;tem is not rigid: it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the natural feelings of a delicate di&s;po&s;ition. I have given FANNY to one, in who&s;e education and culture, I my&s;elf had a &s;hare; and that may &s;hew you, DELIA, that I am no foe to the feelings of Love."</P>
<P>Here a &s;igh heaved gently the bo&s;om of FANNY&mdash;I dare pre&s;ume, it was the &s;igh of love, Lady LUCY.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h, continued Sir HENRY, to &s;ee each of my children, a wife, or a hu&s;band, or a parent, and at the head of an infant &s;ociety. I wi&s;h DELIA to have the man of her heart&mdash;Perhaps &s;he has lately &s;een that man&mdash;Perhaps the accompli&s;hed Mr. SEDLEY&mdash;"</P>

I will not enquire into this matter, till you judge it for your happine&s;s to con&s;ult me; and till then, particular enquiries would be prema|ture&mdash;perhaps improper.&mdash;Only, be cir|cum&s;pect: look well at the ground before you build on it the foundation of your happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.

<P>THAT you was &s;uperior to the feeblene&s;s of the modi&s;h female, who af|fects to li&s;p, to &s;hudder at the &s;hower, and tremble at the breeze, I knew before: but that your &s;oul was &s;o nicely attuned to the pains and plea&s;ures of mine, I was not &s;o aware of, till the receipt of your la&s;t kind favour.</P>

villa, I will pay you my warme&s;t ac|knowledgments by my embraces. I put your letter, with a &s;parkling eye, into the hand of my old friend: he read it, and bur&s;t forth into extacies peculiar to the manly violence of his nature. "'Sdeath, VERNON, &s;aid he, ten &s;uch wives as thine would re&s;tore the female character from the ignominy of the re&s;t of the &s;ex. Such were the Spartan, &s;uch were the Roman women: I do not wi&s;h our wives to fight, Lieutenant: I do not wi&s;h them to wield the battle-ax, nor to eject the bomb, but, in the name of honour, let them &s;uffer their hu&s;bands to behave like men, and permit tho&s;e who wear beards to de&s;erve them. I love &s;oftne&s;s, VERNON, and con|&s;ider it as the female characteri&s;tic, but &s;till I would have &s;ome di&s;tinction made betwixt women and children, exclu&s;ive of the mere difference of bodily &s;ize: and I do declare to thee, Lieutenant, though I

have &s;een many women that I could have liked, &s;ome that I could love, yet I never dared venture upon matrimony, le&s;t my wife &s;hould &s;tand betwixt me and my duty as a &s;oldier: but could I, like thee, have met with a SOPHIA, I had long &s;ince taken to my&s;elf a brave-&s;pirited wench, who &s;hould have &s;pread the triumphal ro&s;es under my feet, and wove her gar|land of welcome again&s;t my return. But you are the happy hero: you are more than a general in the affections of SO|PHIA. Go on then, &mdash; embark &mdash; exert your&s;elf to merit &s;o illu&s;trious a girl: fail not, I charge you, to vi&s;it me with SO|PHY under your arm, on your coming again to the country you have honoured." I was preparing to give him the farewel embrace, but he held me by the hand, and &s;urveying his figure in a gla&s;s that was oppo&s;ite, &s;hook his head and bur&s;t in|to tears: "Thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, (&s;till look|ing

Then turning to the other end of the room, he took from the mantle|piece a &s;word, cautiou&s;ly guarded from the ru&s;t by a &s;carlet ca&s;e,&mdash;"There&mdash;(continued the Major, after he had taken it from the covering)&mdash;there, VERNON, is the blade that attended me in all my fortunes for more than thirty years: examine it&mdash;take notice of the marks of prowe&s;s: it is no maiden I'll a&s;&s;ure thee:
<Q><L>A better never did a belt &s;u&s;tain</L>
<L>Upon a &s;oldier's thigh.</L></Q>
Take it Lieutenant. The hand which u&s;ed to manage it, is gone, and with it the occupation of poor FRASER: 'tis a &s;hame that &s;o excellent a friend &s;hould be

<P>There are other traits, my dear SOPHIA, of this brave invalid's character, which I &s;hall re&s;erve for the opportunity of dome&s;|tic endearment.

<P>I CONFESS it, LUCY&mdash;he HAS plea&s;ed me; and I am above concealing from my friend, that I admire his <HI>manner</HI> even more than his per&s;on.

I will only mention to you one or two points of his conduct, which will help you, by &s;uch &s;pecimens, to con|jecture the re&s;t. His &s;ervant had played the libertine with an innocent wench, who depended upon the bounty of the bathers
<PB N="127" REF="129">
for her attendance at the pump, and well: the fellow &s;educed her, the poor deluded wretch lo&s;t her virtue, and her means of livelihood at the &s;ame time. Common ma&s;ters would have cuffed the footman, and called the injured girl a &s;impleton. Mr. SEDLEY in&s;i&s;ted upon the deceiver's marrying the deceived; the ceremony has actually been celebrated, and it is &s;aid&mdash; not by him, for he never &s;peaks of him|&s;elf&mdash;that he de&s;igns to &s;ee them well &s;ettled before he leaves BUXTON.</P>
<P>There is, you mu&s;t know&mdash;a lady, who, on her return from the bath to her hou&s;e, was hurt by the over-turning of a car|riage, and the hu&s;band, who is a worthy clergyman, would have been quite di&s;|tracted, had it not been for the cares, ten|derne&s;&s;es, and attention of this obliging man, who hath the art of propitiating every-body to him, and making every|body

around him happy, by tho&s;e nice and minute, yet truly engaging offices, which (being in general con&s;idered as un|important, though in reality I find they are but too plea&s;ing) are too often neg|lected. He is now very frequently in our family, and I rejoice to &s;ee him &s;o much in the confidence and good graces of my father, mother, and brother. As to poor dear FANNY, &s;he &s;eldom talks when &s;he can avoid it; and one may &s;ee Mr. SEDLEY'S good breeding, and even the feelings of his heart, in the manner with which he adapts him&s;elf to the per|&s;on he addre&s;&s;es: when his &s;entiments are directed to Sir HENRY, they are acute, correct, cla&s;&s;ical, penetrating, learned: when to my brother, they are elegant, noble, dignified, and animating: when to my mother, they are grave, conde&s;cend|ing, cautious: when to my &s;i&s;ter, gentle, in an under-tone of voice, &s;oftened as it

<P>WHAT a dreadful change, my dear LUCY, &s;ince I la&s;t wrote to you! There is an unu&s;ual degree of unea&s;ine&s;s on the countenances of my ever-honoured parents: my brother Mr. MORTIMER is pen&s;ive: FANNY was &s;eized with an hy&s;|terical di&s;order while her hu&s;band was com|municating to me the di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. SEDLEY, who has never been at our hou&s;e &s;ince.

refu&s;ed to &s;uffer Mr. MORTIMER to &s;leep with her: &s;ays, &s;he has &s;trong rea&s;ons for it, which he &s;hall know at a proper time. At our coming into the drawing-room, after we were &s;ummoned to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance by SEDLEY (who in his confu&s;ion and hurry to fetch us, ran down our long garden unbraced and without his hat), we found the poor dear creature ju&s;t recover|ing from a &s;woon: her eyes clo&s;ed&mdash;her teeth &s;hut&mdash;her clenched hands locked in each other&mdash;and her dre&s;s in the utmo&s;t di&s;|order, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the violent changes of po&s;ture occa&s;ioned by the fits. I have no heart now, Lady LUCY, to talk of my own affairs; and yet, as you have a right to know every thing that concerns me, I ju&s;t &s;end you a &s;ketch of my brother's conver&s;ation in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e previous to the&s;e alarming circum&s;tances.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Paper, inclo&s;ing Mr. <HI>MORTIMER</HI>'S Addre&s;s to his Si&s;ter, upon Mr. <HI>SEDLEY</HI>'S Subject.</HEAD>
<P>MR. MORTIMER, having led me by the hand through the garden into the &s;ummer|hou&s;e, began, as u&s;ual, with a pretty com|pliment, told me that he found I had al|ready done execution&mdash;that I had made a wound which all the waters of BUXTON were not able to cure, and then proceeded (you know, LUCY, what an able advocate he is) to open the de&s;ign of his calling me a&s;ide. I will own to you, &s;aid he, my dear DELIA, that I &s;ummon your attention in behalf of Mr. SEDLEY; but I will, as nearly as I am able, recollect his own
<PB N="153" REF="155">
words, and, without the lea&s;t endeavour to &s;way you, leave the re&s;ult to your own determination. I lately had a particular conver&s;ation with Mr. SEDLEY, wherein he addre&s;&s;ed me, to the be&s;t of my re|membrance, as follows:</P>
<P>"The motive of this vi&s;it, Mr. MOR|TIMER, is in confidence, to enquire of you, from whom I have rea&s;on to believe &s;he conceals nothing, whether your &s;i&s;ter DELIA is under any pre&s;ent engagement of heart, or in the lea&s;t re&s;pect partial to any one in the di&s;po&s;al of her affections; for I &s;hould &s;hudder to be the cau&s;e of even a negative pain to &s;o amiable a wo|man: and I forebore to a&s;k this que&s;tion of Sir HENRY, le&s;t that regard which he is plea&s;ed to entertain of me might incline him to &s;omething that might be contradic|tory to the private pro&s;pects of his daugh|ter. I know, Mr. MORTIMER, the frater|nal
<PB N="154" REF="156">
affection your &s;i&s;ter bears you, and I am no &s;tranger, young as I am in your acquaintance, to the all-&s;ouled intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between you as happy relations: hence, I imagined it more for the general peace to direct my&s;elf to you rather than to any other: for as my enquiries are an|&s;wered by <HI>you,</HI> Mr. MORTIMER, I will either bury my ambitious wi&s;hes in my own and your bo&s;om, or, &s;hould they meet an encouraging reply, I will proceed to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;eem to you mo&s;t conducive to the happine&s;s I a&s;pire to."</P>
<P>Here, DELIA, he pau&s;ed a little, and then with inimitable grace pur&s;ued his overtures:</P>
<P>"Although, Mr. MORTIMER&mdash;&s;aid he&mdash; I have had of late often the honour of Sir HENRY'S company, who&s;e neare&s;t &s;e|crets of heart I am beginning to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
I never found that he had any view of uniting Mi&s;s DELMORE to any particular family. But why do I talk thus? Sir HENRY &s;purns the bare idea of compul|&s;itory connections, and his noble nature can never &s;toop to barter the felicity of a child to intere&s;ted pro&s;pects. And yet, Sir, may it not be rea&s;onably apprehended, that a &s;oul &s;o delicate&mdash;a heart &s;o &s;u&s;cep|tible&mdash;feelings &s;o fine&mdash;and a bo&s;om &s;o alive to every nicer alarm, as Mi&s;s DEL|MORE'S, may have made &s;ome wi&s;e and favourite choice of her own? If &s;o, tell me of it frankly, and I promi&s;e, dear MORTIMER,&mdash;to join you in promoting ra|ther than oppo&s;ing the happine&s;s &s;he hopes for. After what I have now &s;aid, you will be quite explicit, ingenuous, and unre|&s;erved."</P>
<P>He waited my reply; his fine eyes &s;hone with expectation: I told him that I
<PB N="156" REF="158">
believed my &s;i&s;ter DELIA had not yet, among&s;t the various preten&s;ions made to her hand, &s;een the object &s;he could ap|prove in the intimate light he alluded to: that I had often heard her expre&s;s a proper regard to the excellences, manners, and addre&s;s, of Mr. SEDLEY: that, as a very young friend, introduced into the fami|ly by the hand of &s;o revered and &s;aga|cious a father, &s;he had an elegant opinion of his merit: and that though I had not ob&s;erved the lea&s;t intimation of her enter|taining any &s;en&s;ibility of <HI>heart</HI> as to his per&s;on (here, DELIA, he bowed, and blu&s;hed), yet that (be not di&s;plea&s;ed, DE|LIA) I knew her naturally &s;oft, &s;en&s;ible, and a nice di&s;tingui&s;her of &s;uperior endow|ments. I concluded with &s;aying, that, for the &s;hort time I could boa&s;t the honour of his acquaintance, I knew none more likely to in&s;pire Mi&s;s DELMORE; and that, as a proof of my good wi&s;hes, I
<PB N="157" REF="159">
would take the opportunity given me of Sir HENRY and Lady DELMORE'S evening-ride, from which I would excu&s;e us young folks, to inform you of the conver&s;ation previous to any farther procedure.</P>
<P>His cheeks coloured to their full bloom (and you know what a complexion he has, DELIA) at this propo&s;al: he begged, with great delicacy, that, till I was pre-ac|quainted with your propo&s;als, wi&s;hes, and views, I would pre&s;erve the whole matter a &s;ecret, not only from your mother and Sir HENRY, but even from my wife, the angelic Mrs. MORTIMER, as he was plea&s;ed to call her: adding, that he could not bear to occa&s;ion, by an ill-timed petition, one moment's unea&s;ine&s;s in a family &s;o harmonized, innocent, and affectionate, as Sir HENRY DELMORE'S; and that, rather than be cruelly in&s;trumental in the &s;ubver|&s;ion of this, although his heart was in the
<PB N="158" REF="160">
cau&s;e, he would &s;tifle the pleadings of it to eternity.&mdash;I ea&s;ily prevailed, DELIA, on Sir HENRY and your mother to excu&s;e us, and, as &s;oon as their chariot rolled from the door, I took Mr. SEDLEY by the arm, and told him I was going to be his advo|cate. He pre&s;&s;ed my hand, and in a whi&s;|per &s;aid he would have the honour to keep Mrs. MORTIMER company in the &s;aloon, while I pleaded for him in the &s;ummer|hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, my dear DELIA, continued my brother, may I not congratulate you on the conque&s;t of a man who, if there is any faith in the faire&s;t appearances, is equally adorned in mind and body, and who will, I dare &s;ay, in&s;tantly proceed to acquaint us with his circum&s;tances and fortunes, if he receives your &s;anction to be more ex|plicit. I mu&s;t own I was never &s;o truly attracted by any man, and he really &s;eems

<P>When you have read the inclo&s;ed, LU|CY, give me the &s;entiment of your heart upon it: for my own part, flattering as it is, I am too di&s;ordered, and too much intere&s;ted in the &s;udden gloom that hangs over our hou&s;e, to find &s;atisfaction in any thing. Yet I am always</P>

Nay, my friend, I will do more than this: the child that I tru&s;ted but on Tue&s;day la&s;t to the tomb, &s;hall be rai&s;ed again from the earth.

<P>Soon after I had obeyed the&s;e com|mands, a door opened, out of which came the mo&s;t elegant appearance of the female &s;ex that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined, and with her a &s;econd form, who&s;e face was &s;haded by a &s;nowy veil&mdash;"Mortal," &s;aid the fir&s;t &s;plendid figure&mdash;<Q>the prayer of the affectionate &s;hall not be offered in vain&mdash;
<PB N="172" REF="174">
thy friend &s;hall live, and lo! here &s;he is in the bloom of beauty, and in the height of health.</Q> Saying this, the veil was thrown a&s;ide, and in the &s;econd form I im|mediately recognized the features of FAN|NY, more animated and animating than ever &mdash;I ran to embrace the &s;i&s;ter of my friend &mdash;but the Angel of PITY interpo&s;ed, and, after bidding me depart in peace, &s;he waved a golden wand, and then the different emo|tions occa&s;ioned by the vi&s;ion awaked me.</P>
<P>And yet, DELIA, I am per&s;uaded this dream will be propitious. How truly happy &s;hall I be, if you &s;end me word that I have made a trip to Ely&s;ium to &s;ome purpo&s;e. Nor will I, at any rate, &s;uffer you to call me &s;uper&s;titious; for the thing is very probable: &s;urely, in reco|vering &s;uch a woman, where &s;uch a fa|mily and &s;uch a hu&s;band are concerned, the Angels of PITY and HEALTH may very

His making a confident of your brother was &s;uch a &s;troke of policy as &s;hews him to be no ordinary lover; and I can &s;ee, (from the delicate turn of his compliments, and his management of tho&s;e namele&s;s de|licacies, which, though called minute, are among&s;t the points of importance,) that he is no novice in tho&s;e matters.&mdash;You a&s;k for my &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject: What can I &s;ay?&mdash;Have you not &s;ent me the mo&s;t amiable &s;pecimen of his attachment? &mdash;Was not this attachment di&s;covered in a mode peculiar to the elegance of his cha|racter?&mdash;Has he not per&s;on&mdash;manner&mdash;for|tune&mdash;wit&mdash;&s;en&s;e?&mdash;Do you not know what

<P>Thus recommended, then, my dear, on all &s;ides, how is it po&s;&s;ible that my &s;enti|ments &s;hould not be greatly in his favour? How is it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould not wi&s;h to alter the &s;uper&s;cription of my letters, and direct them for Mrs. SEDLEY?</P>

<P>I CONGRATULATE you, Sir, on your victory over every feeling that &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>human</HI> &s;pecies from the <HI>brutal:</HI> or rather I &s;alute you upon your notable tran&s;migration! The &s;y&s;tem of the philo&s;opher who contended for &s;uch a change, you have adopted, even <HI>in this world,</HI> with &s;ucce&s;s. Yes, Mr. SED|LEY, you are mo&s;t compleatly <HI>brutalized</HI> indeed. Although I have not the <HI>di&s;ho|nour</HI> to know you per&s;onally, I make bold to addre&s;s a few &s;entiments to you,

chiefly to acquaint you with what you might otherwi&s;e be for &s;ome time igno|rant. Your principal victims were bu|ried la&s;t night, and the &s;urvivor is in a fair way of &s;oon following them.</P>
<P>I could have wi&s;hed, however, for the &s;ake of your amu&s;ement, as it &s;eems you are gratified upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, that you had been a &s;pectator of this funeral. Though I can ea&s;ily conceive you do not love <HI>preaching,</HI> yet, in the di&s;cour&s;e of la&s;t night, there were &s;uch remarks as might have highly diverted &s;o <HI>elevated</HI> a mind as yours?</P>
<P>But, to drop this ineffectual part of my &s;ubject, and proceed to another, more likely to excite your curio&s;ity, Do you know, mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous and yet mo&s;t <HI>negligent</HI> Sir, that a part of your trea&s;ures are now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?&mdash;To &s;peak

plainer: you mu&s;t know that, among&s;t the now u&s;ele&s;s cloaths and other late nece&s;&s;aries of the entombed HARRIET, was found a BOOK, very thickly marked both by marginal notes, cro&s;&s;es of the nail, points of the pen, and &s;trokes of the pencil; and in the fair leaf next the title there is written what di&s;tingui&s;hes it to be Mr. SEDLEY'S property.</P>
<P>Now, it plainly appears, Sir, from the &s;everal parts referred to, that you pur|po&s;ely pillaged the volume for the <HI>per|nicious,</HI> and rejected the <HI>in&s;tructive.</HI> This would have been very proper, had you contented your&s;elf, like other commen|tators, with reprobating what is <HI>wrong,</HI> in order to &s;et it apart from what is <HI>right:</HI> but how could &s;uch ordinary methods be expected from a per&s;on &s;o very <HI>extra|ordinary!</HI> You, Sir, have even improved upon your original, and have ingeniou&s;ly

<Q><L>How like a dog look'd Hercules,</L>
<L>Thus to a di&s;taff chain'd!</L></Q>
<P>'SDEATH, TIMONTHY, "I'm &s;ped, I'm married." In the very flower of my youth, in the bud of my adven|tures, I am cut off from all the joys of rambling, by matrimony. In a word, TIMOTHY, the fir&s;t fair &s;he that I was <HI>well with,</HI> as the great Lord CHESTER|FIELD calls it, complained in form to my
<PB N="212" REF="214">
ma&s;ter, who, in the moment of his rage, drew his &s;word, cocked his pi&s;tol, and giving me the choice of two cur&s;ed things &mdash;namely, death or a wife&mdash;would certain|ly have &s;ent me to my account, "with all my imperfections on my head," even now broad blown in the middle of May, if I had not fixed upon &s;omething: and, al|though in the confu&s;ion of my fears I have cho&s;en the wor&s;t of the two de&s;ti|nies, by taking to my bed the low-born wench I have <HI>&s;imulated,</HI> yet "no man knows the fate he's born to," and I have been to the church with a water-dipper&mdash; yea, TIMOTHY, with a creature, who, for &s;ome years, hath got her bread by &s;tand|ing at the &s;ide of the bath, and pre&s;enting a brimmer of the water to the pa&s;&s;enger. Then &s;he is as in&s;ipid as the water it&s;elf, and ten times more illiterate than the tum|bler that contains it. I marked her out only as a petty experiment, ju&s;t to bring
<PB N="213" REF="215">
my hand into play, as it were, before I ventured to CHESTERFIELDISE&mdash;a word, TIMOTHY, I collected from THORNTON'S letters, which thou knowe&s;t I have an oc|ca&s;ional acce&s;s to&mdash;with others. However, my &s;pou&s;e&mdash;or rather my &s;po&s;o&mdash;for I would avoid vulgar expre&s;&s;ions, which are "certain characteri&s;tics of bad company, and a bad education"&mdash;my &s;po&s;o is whole|&s;ome, pretty, and not ill-made: but as &s;he has not the &s;malle&s;t degree of <HI>ton</HI> about her, and doth not pretend the mo&s;t di&s;tant acquaintance with either A, B, C, or any of the twenty-four members in that learned family, I de&s;pair of ever making her figure as an editor, or, indeed, of col|lecting together any of my papers, upon which account I charge thee, TIMOTHY, to pre&s;erve, very cautiou&s;ly, all my letters, notes, minutes, and maxims; and as I &s;hall very &s;oon travel&mdash;(for a wife at home will only give me <HI>eclat</HI> abroad, and thou

<P><PB N="215" REF="217">Above all points, TIMOTHY, avoid care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s: let not a &s;lip of our &s;acred &s;imu|lations be &s;een. SEDLEY, with all his cle|verne&s;s and graces, is a mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s fellow&mdash;&s;aving his authority. There is not a &s;yllable in his corre&s;pondence to THORNTON but I am acquainted with it. Many a <HI>&s;mall</HI> e&s;&s;ential he hits off to ad|miration. As far as the maxims of his Author extends, in regard to being well with women, he is a wonder. But of this exclu&s;ive, between our&s;elves, he is a bun|gler. He never puts his epi&s;tles into the office with his own hand; he tru&s;ts them to me, under the &s;imple &s;afeguard of a wet wafer: my knowledge of the world points out to me the nece&s;&s;ity of learning all I can, e&s;pecially when I can make ob|&s;ervations without being ob&s;erved. But, be&s;ides this, an epi&s;tle &s;o hurried off is but half a letter; for nicely is it noted, that neatne&s;s in folding up, <HI>&s;ealing,</HI> and direct|ing,
<PB N="216" REF="218">
is by no means to be neglected: there is &s;omething even in the exterior of a let|ter that may plea&s;e or di&s;plea&s;e, and con|&s;equently de&s;erves attention. Thou mu&s;t know, TIMOTHY, and I tell it thee in great confidence, that I have be&s;towed &s;e|veral lei&s;ure-hours in preparing for thine eye (and in due time for the world, that is, <HI>again&s;t my will</HI>) a Treati&s;e on Toothpick|ing, wherein I &s;hew the preci&s;e method of holding, handling, drawing, and replacing the dentical in&s;truments.

And that every thing may be com|pleat, I have &s;ketched out a plan for a &s;a|tire
<PB N="217" REF="219">
again&s;t tricks and oddities, of which I &s;end thee, underneath, a couplet or two, by way of &s;pecimen of the work.</P>
<Q><L>Some pluck the button from the injur'd cloaths,</L>
<L>While others rub the ears, and pick the no&s;e.</L>
<L>Some are &s;o de&s;titute of air and grace,</L>
<L>Even while they &s;peak, to turn away the face:</L>
<L>Nay, &s;ome there are, to delicacy dead,</L>
<L>Who always have the fingers in the head;</L>
<L>This &s;mells his meat, and makes his neighbour &s;ick,</L>
<L>This clown eats &s;low, and that a world too quick.</L>
<L>Nay &s;ome, to &s;uch a height is rudene&s;s grown,</L>
<L>Will grea&s;e their lips in picking of a bone.</L></Q>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, forget to appri&s;e thee of the mo&s;t elaborate of all my works, entituled, The Art of Carving, wherein the adroitne&s;s and gentility of doing the honours of the table, without hacking acro&s;s a bone, without be&s;pattering the
<PB N="218" REF="220">
company with the &s;auce, and without over|turning the gla&s;&s;es into our neighbours pockets, will be critically con&s;idered. At the end of my performances I propo&s;e to annex certain mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;ervations on men and manners, &s;uch as knowledge of the world&mdash;the taking off the hat&mdash;offer|ing the hand&mdash;making the bow&mdash;hanging the &s;word&mdash;managing the cane&mdash;holding the knife and fork&mdash;blowing the no&s;e&mdash;and all the et-caetera e&s;&s;ential to a gentleman. I &s;hall, by way of &s;upplement, add a few <HI>free</HI> thoughts on mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, a ca|veat again&s;t ba&s;hfulne&s;s, hints on exterior &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and cautions on flexibility of countenance; with a key to the heart, or the &s;tudy of weakne&s;&s;es, infirmities, foi|bles, and pa&s;&s;ions, illu&s;trated: in &s;hort, TIMOTHY, my labours all together will form a compleat commentary on CHES|TERFIELD, and I would have them let|tered
<PB N="219" REF="221">
on the back thus: TRAVERSE <HI>on</HI> STANHOPE. Per&s;picuity is a peculiar grace.</P>
<P>Oh! TIMOTHY, why were talents like mine denied an adequate fortune? Here has SEDLEY been, almo&s;t a month, catch|ing a couple of beauties&mdash;&s;imulating a pair of petticoats; when I, had my pur&s;e been like his, could have compa&s;&s;ed a do|zen. To &s;ay the truth, he has been ra|ther unlucky too, for one of his dam&s;els is dead, and the other is moving off.</P>
<P>You will gue&s;s what a regard I pay to moral character, when, notwith&s;tanding my poverty, I &s;corn to repair my &s;hattered fortunes by impeaching him. No, TI|MOTHY, that would be ba&s;e&mdash;let every gentleman's affairs be &s;acred: I mu&s;t not wound my feelings&mdash;I mu&s;t not be bla&s;ted, TIMOTHY&mdash;I mu&s;t not be bla&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">I lament nothing, my friend, but want of <HI>money;</HI> and yet I have been lately thinking, <HI>manner,</HI> may procure even that. Surely, TIMOTHY, the &s;ame &s;prightly powers that can make a cuckold, cannot fail, if dexterou&s;ly applied, to help a man's pocket. There is a very rich, old, rheu|matical, heavy-heel'd fellow at the bath, whom I have fixed my eye upon, and am re&s;olved to try the experiment.</P>
<P>Surely the &s;erious exterior may befriend us with men as well as women. I know his weakne&s;&s;es&mdash;and he &s;ays he is &s;ure I was born a gentleman. Money I mu&s;t really have.</P>
<P>Now, taking a ride upon the King's high-way, rather late in the evening, is &s;o cur&s;edly hazardous, and I have &s;uch an objection to roguery, that I cannot think of it: but I am per&s;uaded I can &s;imulate
<PB N="221" REF="223">
or di&s;&s;imulate&mdash;(for I hardly know the di&s;|tinction)&mdash;a pur&s;e or two, and make the per&s;on &s;imulated plea&s;ed with him&s;elf, and much obliged to me for taking it. This is, at wor&s;t, an ingenious way of running round the halter, without putting the neck into it; and if we view it as it ought to be viewed, it is only a notable way of making a man pay &s;o much gold for &s;o much flattery, &s;elf-love, and &s;atisfaction.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. THOMAS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received &s;afe all the letters you directed to me, and I &s;hould have honoured them much &s;ooner, had it been in my power; but the truth is, I have too much bu&s;ine&s;s to allow much time for plea&s;ure&mdash;or, rather, I endeavour to make my plea&s;ure and my bu&s;ine&s;s go fair and &s;oftly, like worthy fellow-&s;ervants in the &s;ame family.

<P>PHILIP SEDLEY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>your</HI> Lord, makes it his amu&s;ement to rattle away from &s;alt|water to fre&s;h-water, from this polite place to that polite place, (to &s;peak more pro|perly,) from one <HI>Ton</HI> to another <HI>Ton,</HI> till he has &s;hewn him&s;elf <HI>every-where,</HI> without

More|over, Mr. TOM, there is nothing &s;imilar between our families. I <HI>&s;ave,</HI> you do <HI>not</HI> &s;ave. I am <HI>prudent,</HI> you are not.

I delight in the appellation of plain TIM, or TIMOTHY&mdash; You are offended unle&s;s, Sir, or Mr, pre|cedes the name which was be&s;towed upon you by your godfathers and godmothers.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, TOM&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;in &s;hort, Mr. THOMAS, I begin to think (as we &s;o little re&s;emble one another, either in our

likings or aver&s;ions) that we had better not put our&s;elves for the future to the ex|pence of po&s;tage; which (as you and your ma&s;ter are addicted to go pretty far into the country, and you are apt to write four letters where a man of le&s;s genius and &s;pirit would &s;carce write one) is really a &s;erious circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Not that I &s;hould propo&s;e &s;uch a matter neither, were there no other ob&s;tacle in the way: for (to flouri&s;h for a moment in your mode) I mu&s;t inform you, that
<Q><L>The friends I have, and their adoption try'd,</L>
<L>I'd grapple to my heart with hooks of &s;teel.</L></Q>
Frankly to &s;peak therefore, Mr. TRAVERSE, (though you are undoubtedly a youth of parts, and able to do as much harm as any lad I know) you are not the man to my mind. In a word, TOM, I never took kindly to you; and &s;ince your la&s;t letter,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM this moment arrived in town from BUXTON, where the body of your wounded friend Mr. SEDLEY will be found either by you, or any of tho&s;e who think it worth while to own him. He has, as I &s;uppo&s;e you know, been the occa&s;ion of the mo&s;t multiplied mi&s;chief that ever was, I believe, committed in the &s;ame

&s;pace of time, in that or any other town. His death, however, and his repentance, which appears to be &s;incere, are all that man can have.</P>
<P>It would by no means intere&s;t a &s;tran|ger, as you are, Sir, to particularize the &s;orrows your friend has introduced, not only in my family, but others equally happy before his admittance into them. But I under&s;tand from this libertine, who put your late letters into my hand, after I had wounded him, that you have mar|ried the mo&s;t intimate friend of my di&s;|honoured FANNY: to her it will not be unintere&s;ting to ob&s;erve, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible &s;he &s;hould ever behold again alive that mo&s;t injured and unfortunate girl, who was upon the point of expiring be|fore I left BUXTON, which I thought it prudent to do, (notwith&s;tanding my in|difference

to all future events,) till I &s;ee what is to be done with the broken-hearted authors of FANNY'S exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of Mr. SEDLEY'S villainy has, I perceive, been already exhibited to the eye of Mr. THORNTON, who hath, it &s;eems, long been his confident and cor|re&s;pondent; though he mu&s;t pardon me, if I e&s;teem <HI>him</HI> le&s;s worthy the noble-minded ARAMINTA, who could counte|nance, by his regard, the actions of a PHILIP SEDLEY.

The affair betwixt me and the offender, hap|pened in the dead of night: the &s;urgeon, to whom I went my&s;elf, in defiance of danger, a&s;&s;ures me the wound is vital.
