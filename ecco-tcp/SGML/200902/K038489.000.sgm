<P>THE LADY OF THE MANOR, A COMIC OPERA: AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>WRITTEN BY DR. KENRICK.</P>
<P>THE SONGS SET TO MUSIC BY MR. HOOK.</P>
<P>LONDON: PRINTED FOR E. AND C. DILLY IN THE POULTRY; J. WILKIE, IN ST. PAUL'S CHURCH-YARD; T. DA|VIES, IN GREAT RUSSEL-STREET, COVENT-GARDEN, AND J. WALTER, CHARING-CROSS. MDCCLXXVIII.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE outline of the following Opera (written about ten years ago, by way of relaxation from &s;everer &s;tudies) was taken from the <HI>Country La&s;&s;es</HI> of Mr. <HI>Charles John&s;on,</HI> particularly the plea&s;ing and romantic epi&s;ode, borrowed from the <HI>Cu&s;tom of the Country</HI> of <HI>Beaumont and Fletcher.</HI></P>
<P>The author, in accommodating his plan to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te, was led, of cour&s;e, to reject the revolting ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing the cu&s;tom in que&s;tion &s;till to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">The con&s;iderable alterations and addi|tions, al&s;o, which he found it expedient to make, both in the plot and dialogue, have &s;o much diver&s;ified the whole, that it has been as <HI>truly</HI> as <HI>ill-naturedly</HI> ob|&s;erved, <Q>the piece re&s;embles a coat, &s;tolen a &s;econd time from a thief, &s;o metamorpho&s;ed, that the very tay|lor, who fir&s;t cut it out, would not know the handy-work of his own &s;hears.</Q></P>
<P>It is no wonder that, in this age of <HI>originality,</HI> &s;o many <HI>truly-original</HI> cri|tics, who never play at <HI>rob-thief</HI> them|&s;elves, &s;hould &s;ufficiently rally him on &s;o artful and complete a transformation, He cannot help thinking, however, that the&s;e <HI>very hone&s;t</HI> gentlemen are a little unrea&s;onable in expecting him to do &s;uch <HI>great things</HI> merely for his <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> as are done by tho&s;e who make play|writing their &s;erious <HI>occupation.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">If, therefore, this opera hath hitherto met with an approbation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it afford any con&s;olation to the profe&s;&s;ional dramati&s;ts, who envy him this approbation, they may re&s;t &s;atisfied, he is by no means di&s;po&s;ed even to amu&s;e him&s;elf any more the &s;ame way.</NOTE> as general as even the be&s;t of their mo&s;t elabo|rate productions; the author cannot but impute it to the excellent acting of the theatrical performers, and the elegant ta&s;te of the mu&s;ical compo&s;er.</P>

<P>To be &s;erious, my dear Lady Lucy, I cannot conceive how any woman, who has youth, beau|ty, and fortune at command, as you have, can take de|light in wandering, like a wild thing, about the woods, in gloomy groves and di&s;mal &s;hades; when &s;he might di&s;play her charms to &s;o much greater advantage in the glittering circle of the Pantheon, or the brilliant vi&s;tas of Vauxhall.</P>

<P>And I can as little conceive how any woman, of &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, can be taken with the artifi|cial amu&s;ements of the town, when &s;he might enjoy the plea&s;ure of breathing the fre&s;h air, and contem|plating the beauties of nature, in the country.</P>

<P>The in&s;olence and impertinence of its inha|bitants. &mdash;Prodigal as I was, I could not bear to be flee|ced by a &s;et of money-making &s;harpers, who differed from coiners, clippers, and cut-pur&s;es only, in being greater criminals with greater &s;ecurity. &mdash;I could not endure the haughtine&s;s of &s;coundrel up&s;tarts; who, by taking advantage of the weakne&s;s, or admini&s;tring to the wickedne&s;s of mankind, were enabled to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of gentlemen, and lolled at ea&s;e in the carriages, which hone&s;ter men were forced to drive.</P>

<SP>

<P>Poh! that a man might do for an hundred women, he was never in love with. To die for a wo|man, Manly, is a mere piece of gallantry.

<P>Then you mu&s;t die &s;oon, Manly, take my word for it. However, if you have a mind to put your pa&s;&s;ion to a violent death, you will take the readie&s;t way. Marriage is as certain a remedy for love, as an incurable mortification is for all other di&s;orders.</P>

<P>Look at her again, then, and be converted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Convert thy&s;elf, my friend. To marry a wo|man merely for her beauty, is to en&s;lave your whole body for the gratification only of your eyes. But why nerd you marry her?

<P>So, &s;o. There, there; the game is &s;afe. What, my hone&s;t gue&s;t, Mr. Wildman! Is it you that have &s;trolled out poaching abroad &s;o early? You are really a very mode&s;t gentleman. What can you &s;ay for your&s;elf now? Ha!</P>

<P>Say! Why I &s;ay that your kin&s;woman here has been very uncivil to me.</P>

<P>And you would have been as much too civil to her! Hah! Is it not &s;o? Come, come, bring him along. He &s;hall have a ducking and a fair race for it. Our

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to common law; which is founded &s;ole|ly on cu&s;tom: and it has been the cu&s;tom, time out of mind, for us young fellows, who&s;e blood flows bri&s;k|ly through our veins, to u&s;e no ceremony with a whole|&s;ome cherry-cheek'd country wench, wherever we have the opportunity of a barn, bed, hovel, or haycock.</P>

<P>A little agreeable violence is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary on the&s;e occa&s;ions. It &s;aves a world of alterca|tion and gives an edge to appetite.</P>

<P>Come, come, old boy, don't mi&s;take your ill-nature for virtue, or your cru&s;ty humour for an antipa|thy to vice. Every cynic is not a philo&s;opher. Pr'y|thee poli&s;h your&s;elf, therefore, my dear rough diamond. You are the &s;oure&s;t old fellow, I think, I ever met with. You invite a man into your hou&s;e here, and then deny him the only tid-bit he has a mind to.</P>
</SP>

<P>You know the conditions, Sir, on which you entered this hou&s;e. But you have broken through every &s;ocial obligation, and yet imagine you are &s;till acting in the character of a gentleman.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stern.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not mine, I a&s;&s;ure you. I have lived long enough to be a little wi&s;er. But the young woman you have in&s;ulted, has a lover; who lives in the neigh|bourhood,
