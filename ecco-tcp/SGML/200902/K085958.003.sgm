<HEAD>CHAP. I. HANNAH GETS RID OF ONE TROUBLESOME COM|PANION, AND FINDS ANOTHER; SHE IS SHOCKED AT A HORRIBLE DISCOVERY; WHICH, HOWEVER, LEADS TO A PLEASURABLE ONE.</HEAD>
<P>No conception, however, lively, no lan|guage, however forcible, no pen, however ingenious, ever yet &s;ucceeded in de&s;crib|ing
<PB N="2" REF="4">
the lo&s;t, the unhinged &s;tate of the hu|man mind, when &s;udden and dreadful di&s;tre&s;s brings on a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the mental faculties; much le&s;s can the tumultuary throng of broken and inco|herent ideas be de&s;cribed, which &s;eem to be precipitated from the overloaded heart to the wandering brain, at the doubtful return of imperfect recollection.</P>
<P>Though I &s;hould never forget, we re I to live a thou&s;and years, the freezing hor|ror, the madening agony, I endured when I encountered the murderous glare of the lione&s;s, as her eyes fla&s;hed fire in the mo|ment of &s;pringing at me, yet I cannot think I was utterly &s;en&s;ele&s;s, except for a very &s;hort interval. My &s;ituation was more like that of a frantic bedlamite in a power|ful paroxi&s;m. I &s;creamed, I fought, I re|&s;i&s;ted; and verily believed when, at the moment rea&s;on began to dawn, I felt &s;omething tug my cloaths, that I was co|vered with wounds, and at my la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
Judge of my a&s;toni&s;hment, reader, when, as my recollection grew more and more perfect, I found my&s;elf entirely free from injury, and that it was nothing but the cub that occa&s;ioned the tugging which I de|&s;cribed before. If I was a&s;toni&s;hed at this, how was my wonder turned to delight, when looking wildly round me, I beheld the lione&s;s &s;tretched on a pointed promi|nence of the rock beneath me and welter|ing in gore.</P>
<P>The truth was, that as I fell at the very in&s;tant &s;he &s;prung at me, &s;he could not re|&s;i&s;t the force of her own impetuo&s;ity; and meeting with nothing to oppo&s;e the vio|lence of the effort &s;he made to &s;eize me, &s;he was precipitated over my head into the aby&s;s beneath. My&s;terious Providence, thought I, that can'&s;t &s;trengthen the &s;ingle hair by which our lives are &s;u&s;pended, to mock the force of the tempe&s;t, and the fe|rocity of lions. Oh, what an effu&s;ion of
<PB N="4" REF="6">
gratitude i&s;&s;ued from my lips! But not fa&s;t enough to relieve my poor loaded heart; I grew dizzy, every artery throbbed, I thought I &s;hould again have fainted. At length a flood of thankful tears calmed me into obedient and pa&s;&s;ive re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>And now the poor cub, that &s;eemed delighted at my returning to life, frolicked and played about me like a kitten. I could not help taking plea&s;ure at its awk|ward antics, and yet it was a plea&s;ure mingled with dread. Who knew if I at|tempted to protect it, when it grew older, and got &s;trength, but my life would be the forfeit? Was compa&s;&s;ion to a brute a &s;en|&s;ation to be indulged by me? Had I not, in my own &s;pecies, experienced the vil|lany of a fal&s;e friend, the barbarity of an unnatural brother, and even the cruelty of an unkind hu&s;band? And could I expect any thing but treachery and de&s;truction from a bea&s;t of prey? No; I was deter|mined
<PB N="5" REF="7">
to rid my&s;elf of every fear by de|&s;troying the object of my apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>As I was ab&s;orbed in this meditation, the poor thing came about me in &s;o inno|cent and harmle&s;s a manner, that all the world could not have induced me to in|jure it. I ever held life as &s;o &s;acred a tru&s;t, though Heaven knows, for the bene|fit's with which it abounds, it is &s;carcely worth pre&s;erving, that I never wantonly, nor perver&s;ely de&s;troyed any thing that had animal exi&s;tence. What new feelings then was I to adopt that could &s;o far make me forget my nature as to kill the thing that flew to me for protection.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I argued thus: What the mo|ther did was natural. It was in defence of her young, and the mercy of that gracious Providence, who had de&s;troyed her to pre&s;erve me, would be ill requited were I to take the life of an innocent and defence|le&s;s creature, under a dread of my de&s;truc|tion,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
which no chance could accompli&s;h without the permi&s;&s;ion of Providence. The utmo&s;t, therefore, I could prevail upon my&s;elf to re&s;olve on was, to lo&s;e the cub by the way, and tru&s;t to chance for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus I reflected and rambled, making a &s;hort &s;tay now and then near &s;ome plan|tain tree, where I imperfectly &s;atisfied my hunger, or dipping out withn a &s;hell &s;ome water from one of tho&s;e innumerable rivulets which i&s;&s;ued from the ca&s;cade, to &s;lake my thir&s;t; and all this during a mo&s;t debilitated &s;tate of body, become almo&s;t paralytic with the &s;hocking vici&s;&s;itudes that had a&s;&s;ailed my mind.</P>
<P>I found, however, I had more care upon my hands than for my&s;elf. The poor cub was no more proof again&s;t hun|ger than I; and as it would not leave me, I felt it incumbent on me to procure it &s;ome food. I ma&s;hed the fruit of the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
plantain into a &s;ort of a pa&s;te with water, but he would not touch it. I tried him with berries and other fruit, to no purpo&s;e. At la&s;t he &s;eemed to entice me to the verge of the lawn on the ea&s;t &s;ide, where I perceived a declining path, which led in a &s;erpentine direction among various &s;hrubs, gradually towards the &s;ea &s;hore.</P>
<P>The farther we went on the more eager the cub &s;eemed; and as I made but a &s;low progre&s;s, and was obliged, out of weak|ne&s;s, &s;everal times to &s;it down, he could &s;carcely contain his impatience. At length he darted away from me, and pre&s;ently returned with &s;ome &s;ort of fle&s;h in his mouth, which he laid down at my feet; then ran away again, and then again re|tuned with more fle&s;h, which he began to eat.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t uncommon gloom came over me at this circum&s;tance. Confu&s;ed con|jecture pointed out every thing dreadful,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
and nothing conclu&s;ive. My mind &s;eemed involved as if &s;hutting out faculty; and under the influence of a horrid gloom that di&s;torted idea, and paralyzed reflection, I ha&s;tened to obey an impulfe which I knew would lead me to &s;omething dread|ful, yet which hurried me on with a force re&s;i&s;tle&s;s.</P>
<P>Arrived near the bottom, where a &s;kirt|ing of the rock prevented loo&s;e objects from being wa&s;hed into the &s;ea, gracious God what a horrid &s;ight did I behold! Bones, heads, legs, arms, and other frag|ments of human carca&s;&s;es lay &s;cattered upon the &s;and. My poor heart &s;unk with|in me. Truly, thought I, did I conjecture that the i&s;land had been de&s;poiled of its in|habitants by wild bea&s;ts; truly, did I an|ticipate a fate that too certainly awaits me; and, though I have once miraculou&s;ly e&s;|caped, a fate now inevitable that no &s;helter can evade, no vigilance elude.</P>
<P>Thus I walked about, uttering di&s;|tracted
<PB N="9" REF="11">
and incoherent &s;entences, when I di&s;cerned that, which had I given my&s;elf time for reflection, would have con&s;ider|ably relieved my mind; the bodies of the poor wretches which had been thus mangled were tho&s;e I had buried. I knew their cloaths, and I knew the wrappers in which I had enclo&s;ed them, and from which they had been torn; and this proves the common ob&s;ervation, that lions will not prey upon carca&s;es, to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found the mouth of that hollow into which I had plunged the bodies; and, as I knew I was then &s;tanding immediately under the wreck, it was my bu&s;ine&s;s &s;e|riou&s;ly to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would be mo&s;t likely to lead me to my old habitation.</P>
<P>Sunk as I was in de&s;pair, never did lightning dart quicker acro&s;s the atmo|&s;phere, than did this ray of hope acro&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="12">
my mind; it made in a moment two im|portant di&s;coveries. I found that no in|jury had been done to the living, and I knew exactly where I was.</P>
<P>Looking about, I ob&s;erved a perfo|ration in the rock, which &s;eemed to take a horizontal direction. This I determined to explore, taking at the &s;ame time, every precaution not to be mi&s;led. When I had ventured, as far as I could judge by mea&s;uring my &s;teps, about three hun|dred yards, all the way upon ri&s;ing ground, the opening took two different roads; one almo&s;t &s;ttraight on, and the other to the left. As I thought I di&s;cerned a glimmer of light at the end of that which led to the left, I pur&s;ued it, knowing, that if I di&s;|covered nothing to my &s;atisfaction, I could but on my return take again a di|rection to the left, and I &s;hould then &s;atisfy my&s;elf as to where it might lead me.</P>
<P>When I got to the end of this cavern,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
I found to my great &s;urprize, that it opened upon the lawn, and I began now to &s;ee that it mu&s;t certainly be contiguous to the plain where I had fixed my abode, and that I had only played about it in my ramblings; I therefore determined to re|turn and pur&s;ue the &s;traight-forward track which of cour&s;e I &s;hould now find by turning to my left. To be brief, I did &s;o, when finding the cavern take two direc|tions again, I providentially pur&s;ued that which led to the right; and, in a few minutes, ob&s;erved the glimmer of a lamp, which I knew could proceed from no place but my inner apartment which &s;erved me for a kitchen, and which lamp I had &s;o con&s;tructed, that it would not only burn for five days, but mark the hours by the decrea&s;e of the oil.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II. HANNAH, LIKE PANDORA, EXPLORES THE FATAL CHEST, FROM WHICH ISSUES ALL MANNER OF EVILS; SHE, HOWEVER, FINDS HOPE AT THE BOTTOM.</HEAD>
<P>FATIGUED to &s;uch a degree as to be almo&s;t bere&s;t of all power, I with incon|ceivable difficulty reached my couch, by the &s;ide of which, my knees involuntarily obeyed their accu&s;tomed office, while my mind i&s;&s;ued from my lips.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort time, my prayers and tears having wonderfully relieved me, I began a little to recollect my&s;elf and con|&s;ider
<PB N="13" REF="15">
what to &s;et about. My fir&s;t wi&s;h was to vi&s;it the wreck, and explore the dreadful &s;ecret that I had &s;o imperfectly di&s;covered; but finding my mind unequal to &s;o trying a ta&s;k, and knowing be&s;ides that night would come on before I could accompli&s;h it, I adopted what prudence dictated and determined, by refre&s;hment and repo&s;e, to &s;trengthen my faculties until they &s;hould be able to &s;u&s;tain all con&s;equences, before I &s;ought to know, what I feared would require their united force, to bear up my re&s;olution again&s;t what I had to endure.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly made a fire and began to prepare my &s;upper, but when I went to fetch &s;ome rice, I found it had been vi&s;it|ed by vermin. I had frequently been plundered by a kind of mungoo&s;e, and another animal like the kangaroo, which I u&s;ed to catch in traps; but, by what I could remark, the creature that had been &s;o bu&s;y in my ab&s;ence was of a &s;maller
<PB N="14" REF="16">
kind; I was not long, however, in the dark, for the young lion, who had not &s;tirred a moment from my &s;ide, as I was laying my cloth, &s;prung acro&s;s the ca|vern, and in a moment returned with a large rat, which he laid at my feet.</P>
<P>Extraordinary occurrences, though of ever &s;o trivial a nature, always made upon my mind a deep impre&s;&s;ion. In my pre&s;ent lonely &s;ituation, my nerves per|petually in a tremulous &s;tate, no wonder if this di&s;po&s;ition had &s;trengthened. I looked at the creature with plea&s;ure, and, but for apprehen&s;ion could have care&s;&s;ed it. I recollected my partiaIity for cats, which &s;eemed to have been dictated by &s;omething intuitive to inure me to the pre&s;ence of a &s;pecies of animal, which, though naturally ferocious, can be tamed and dome&s;ticated.</P>
<P>I went a great way into this, I knew not why. The noble nature of the lion,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
thought I, is almo&s;t a proverb, and &s;o many extraordinary circum&s;tances have been well authenticated concerning him, that there can be no doubt but he is ca|pable of feeling, of honour, of genero&s;ity, and of gratitude. Why then &s;hould we he&s;itate in cultivating the friend&s;hip of a lion, when we cultivate the friend&s;hip of men who we know are incapable of all the&s;e.</P>
<P>Has any body ever dared to di&s;pute the fact of the gladiator, who&s;e life was &s;aved by the intervention of providence, that &s;ent a lion into the circus, out of who&s;e foot the man had plucked a thorn, when he accidentally met him in a fore&s;t? This was more than noble; I know not if it would di&s;honour the expre&s;&s;ion, to call it godlike.</P>
<P>Hannon, a general of a Carthaginian army, after rendering &s;ome accidental &s;ervice to a lion, &s;o tamed him, that he
<PB N="16" REF="18">
followed him to the camp, carried his baggage for him, and became an able and valuable dome&s;tic. This was the noble nature of a brute. See what upon this occa&s;ion was the mean, the groveling feelings of man. The &s;u&s;picious Cartha|ginians, whom Hannon had rendered &s;er|vices of a thou&s;and times greater mag|nitude than he had rendered the lion, they, pu&s;ilanimou&s;ly fearing that a man who could tame lions, would in the end become a formidable and dangerous enemy, bani&s;hed him from their country.</P>
<P>The beautiful &s;tory of Una in Spencer, and the reverence in which a lion is &s;up|po&s;ed to hold the &s;ofter &s;ex, next came into my mind. In &s;hort I went on in &s;uch a train of thinking, and &s;o bewilder|ed my imagination on this &s;ubject, that at length, recollecting on a &s;udden, that by the &s;ize of the animal it mu&s;t have been born not far di&s;tant from the time of the &s;hipwreck, I exclaimed, if I could prevail
<PB N="17" REF="19">
upon my&s;elf to believe in the doctrine of Pythagoras, I might be tempted to think that the &s;oul of Hewit, when it fled his exi&s;tence, returned to inhabit this noble bea&s;t, that &s;o he might yet be my protector,</P>
<P>During the time the&s;e my reflections took place in my mind, I looked at the crea|ture with &s;uch complacency that he &s;eemed delighted. I encouraged him, therefore, called him Leo, and enticed him to eat, but though he lapped up the water, in which &s;ome rice and plantain had been boiled, which had a &s;oft ta&s;te like milk, he &s;eemed to have no reli&s;h for any thing to eat but animal food; I, therefore, gave him permi&s;&s;ion to eat the rat, at which he came purring about me greatly plea&s;ed, and then took it into a corner and de|voured it.</P>
<P>I now retired to re&s;t; not, however,
<PB N="18" REF="20">
without apprehen&s;ion, but not enough to weigh much upon my mind; for after re|viving my confidence by a &s;upplication, fatigue lulled me into a mo&s;t profound &s;leep.</P>
<P>In the morning I found my lion, who, with cat like watch, as Shake&s;pear calls it, had waited for me to awake. I aro&s;e and began to think what I had to do, and to con&s;ider whether I had re&s;olution enough to encounter the dreadful ta&s;k of exploring the che&s;t. I certainly &s;ound my&s;elf greatly re&s;tored, but I was uncommonly depre&s;&s;ed. After breakfa&s;t, however, as &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;eemed to me to be wor&s;e than the wor&s;t certainty, I re&s;olved, let the con&s;equence be what it might, to penetrate the, perhaps, fatal &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Fatal it was, for on opening the che&s;t I di&s;covered but too plainly that it be|longed to my hu&s;band. Oh the horridly cruel feelings that drenched me at every
<PB N="19" REF="21">
pore as I examined the contents of it! My letters to him, tenderly written, at dif|ferent times, little pre&s;ents that I had made him on his birth day, on mine, on the dif|ferent anniver&s;aries of our marriage, new years' gifts, my own portrait, letters he had intended to &s;end me, all collected, no doubt, to &s;erve him as a con&s;olation in my ab&s;ence, other letters which I could not then examine, and a variety of articles, all as &s;o many piles of unmerciful proofs that he for whom I had encountered &s;uch wretchedne&s;s, &s;uch peril, was now no more.</P>
<P>Oh God, cried I, this is dreadful! Was it for this I e&s;caped from &s;hipwreck, from &s;avages, from the machinations of a vil|lain, from famine, from the jaws of the lione&s;s? Oh that the &s;ea had &s;wallowed me! That I had been killed and eaten! That I had died in defending my honour! that I had &s;tarved! that I had &s;atiated the
<PB N="20" REF="22">
hunger of a mon&s;ter! any, any fate rather, Oh infinitely rather, than this! but I have &s;till my remedy in my power, and, &s;urely, when the various, the complicate agra|vations are con&s;idered, if Fate has allotted any particular mini&s;ter to puni&s;h &s;uicide, my unexampled provocation will avert the impending &s;troke, and admitting the plea of &s;tern nece&s;&s;ity, &s;often crime into virtue, and turn the frown of ju&s;tice into the &s;mile of mercy.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, continued I, con&s;ider, Oh God, my deplorable condition! Let me not live to be a prey to reflection, yet let not madne&s;s drive me to &s;elf &s;laughter; rather, if thou &s;hall graciou&s;ly determine that the mea&s;ure of my &s;ufferings is com|plete, &s;tretch forth thy merciful hand and take a life already lo&s;t to all the purpo&s;es of animation.</P>
<P>It would touch the &s;u&s;ceptible reader to the &s;oul, could I find language to pic|ture
<PB N="21" REF="23">
the forlorn, the fallen, the heart &s;ick &s;ituation to which I was reduced. At this moment, at the di&s;tance of a year and a half, my tears blot out the words as I write them, and how Divine Pro|vidence &s;oothed my mind into, an aban|donment, and afterwards into a repentance of my dreadful determination to de&s;troy my&s;elf, that power alone knows, that has permitted me to &s;u&s;tain and to &s;urvive &s;o many trials, with no comfort but the hope that, my carreer of mi&s;ery at an end, I &s;hall, in a better world, meet my hu&s;band never to part again.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing with what avidity the human mind after glutting it&s;elf with in|ordinate di&s;tre&s;s flies to the other ex|treme, and deceives it&s;elf into con&s;olation. Scarcely had I brought my&s;elf into a &s;tate far from compo&s;ure, but &s;omething le&s;s di&s;|tracted, but I chid my ha&s;ty fears that had driven me to grieve for, perhaps, an ima|ginary evil. The arguments I had held
<PB N="22" REF="24">
before occurred to me again. It was true I had a&s;certained the dreadful fact, but it did not actually follow, though probability &s;eemed to lend it a colour, that Hewit was on board at the time the &s;hip was lo&s;t. He might, by accident, have been left behind; the &s;hip might have been driven from her moorings by the &s;torm and he a&s;hore, for the two boats I had &s;een could not have held any thing like her complement of hands. The&s;e and twenty other delu|&s;ive hopes, gro&s;s, ab&s;urd, ignorant, nay, all but impo&s;&s;ible, did I catch at like &s;o many &s;traws, to &s;ave my poor heart from &s;inking.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this im|pul&s;e that I determined to examine the &s;hip's books, and every other document that could po&s;&s;ibly lead me to the real truth; and, indeed, I was &s;tongly inclined to do this from another rea&s;on, which was, that as we were at war with France when the Gro&s;venot left India, it was po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="23" REF="25">
that Hewit might in &s;ome kind of way been captured and his property detained, though he might have been &s;et free.</P>
<P>All the&s;e vague and inconclu&s;ive con|jectures gave way to conviction upon ex|amining the books; for I not only found that he had been a forema&s;tman on board that &s;hip, but by a &s;tation book belonging to one of the mates, that he had not left her at the time &s;he was labouring in the &s;torm, con&s;equently he mu&s;t have been &s;hip|wrecked in her.</P>
<P>Nay, at la&s;t, I found a &s;ignal book in his own hand writing, which informed me that he fired the very gun as a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, that awaked me in the dreadful condition I formerly de&s;cribed as I lay in the cavern. Nay, heart breaking circum|&s;tance, as there was &s;carcely a memoran|dum in the whole book that had not &s;ome tender allu&s;ion, by way of comment, to the violent and unexampled affection he bore
<PB N="24" REF="26">
me, &s;o oppo&s;ite this note did he put up a &s;upplication to Heaven, that unworthy as he was of me, through the mediation of tho&s;e prayers, I might then be putting up for him, and which, Heaven knows, at that very moment I was putting up for him, his impending danger might be averted.</P>
<P>To trouble the reader with the effect this di&s;appointment had on my mind, would be only going over the &s;ame ground again. The difference was, that as my grief, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, was vented in frantic exclamation, &s;o, now, it was &s;ad|dened into &s;ullen de&s;pair,</P>
<P>My inve&s;tigation of this bu&s;ine&s;s was not, however, entirely in vain. I found that the Entrepreneur had &s;hipped a lion|e&s;s, big with young, as a pre&s;ent for the Queen of France; and by the recollection of the bea&s;t that fled from me at the time of the &s;hipwreck, which, doubtle&s;s,
<PB N="25" REF="27">
had buffetted the billows and e&s;caped to &s;hore, and that it could be no other who&s;e fangs I had &s;o miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped, I had no doubt but that it was the mother of poor Leo, and this relieved my mind from any further apprehen&s;ion that bea&s;ts of prey inhabited the i&s;land.</P>
<P>This, though a negative comfort, was yet a comfort; and as a man would forget for a moment the con&s;umption that was wa&s;ting him upon being relieved from the tooth ache, &s;o the malady that I felt and hoped would con&s;ume me, underwent a tran&s;ient &s;u&s;pen&s;ion upon my receiving this a&s;&s;urance that the &s;hort life I was fated to linger out would not be tormented with the additional pang of &s;o terrible an ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>

<P>AFTER an examination of more than five hours of different documents, which now and then contained pa&s;&s;ages too powerful for my feelings, I re&s;olved to return home, and, &s;ince nothing could flatter me with a rever&s;e of my wretched fate, alas now too certain, explore no more at a time than I had re&s;olution to bear.</P>
<P>This le&s;&s;on of prudence I not only &s;et my&s;elf, but performed. If a heart break|ing
<PB N="27" REF="29">
circum&s;tance overpowered me I took the con&s;olation of reflecting that Provi|dence permitted it, perhaps to prevent &s;omething more &s;ini&s;ter. Then I would take a &s;hort walk, look at the beauties that &s;urrounded me, take &s;ome trifling refre&s;h|ment, pat Leo, and then return, peru&s;e more mi&s;ery, and take more relief.</P>
<P>Thus for &s;everal days I went on. I would ki&s;s John Hewit's hair, enclo&s;ed in a trinket, wi&s;h my&s;elf with him, and then &s;olemnly vow not to ha&s;ten my di&s;&s;olution. Then read a fragment of a repentant letter, on which I could plainly perceive he had &s;hed tears, then drop a tear on it my&s;elf, then feel a &s;light relief, then place it near my heart, and make a &s;olitary dinner.</P>
<P>Then would I peru&s;e, in a pocket bible, where our different ages were writ|ten in his own hand, the day of our mar|riage, the ages of our children, the la&s;t of
<PB N="28" REF="30">
which memorandums he had blotted out, and afterwards re&s;tored; then, as in agony, the book was falling from my hand, would accident point me out &s;ome &s;acred &s;en|tence, which, admoni&s;hing my weakne&s;s, in&s;pired me with re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The feeling reader will not only picture this for me, and a great deal more, but will pardon me that I hang upon griefs when it is my duty to relate circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The particulars which I gathered from tho&s;e papers connected with a chain of events, relative to this hi&s;tory, were the&s;e: My brother, the lawyer, while he lay un|der &s;entence of death in Newgate, in|formed Hewit, that he and Sourby had connived at all the wretchedne&s;s he had &s;uffered, that in the la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s Mrs. Vint, who was a ca&s;t off mi&s;tre&s;s of Sourby, was an in&s;trument. It was &s;he who enflamed the pa&s;&s;ions of Hewit, by every art &s;he could devi&s;e; and, in par|ticular,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
by exaggerating every thing rela|tive to the interview with Binns at the play; of bringing proof upon proof, through the medium of engines that were employed, that I had met him repeatedly in private before we went to France.</P>
<P>My brother, the lawyer, however, was very little concerned in this. The whole &s;cheme was concerted between Sourby and that diabolical woman, of whom, though I did not entirely approve, I had the weak|ne&s;s to entertain a good opinion, which, after all, is not wonderful, for I was tired out at la&s;t; and, except &s;ome material concern of my own obliged me to be on my guard, I cho&s;e to &s;ilence the dictates of my own &s;agacity rather than be perpe|tually &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>The&s;e two friends. though they hated each other, joined hand and heart in this infernal plot, his point to gain me, her's to gain Hewit. Our &s;udden departure for
<PB N="30" REF="32">
France delayed their mea&s;ures for a time, our return renewed them. The nice&s;t hints were thrown out, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle arts employed, even my innocent child was an in&s;trument of their infernal infamy, and the reader knows they &s;o far &s;ucceeded as to drive a hu&s;band with a broken heart from her arms, whom, even while he thought her an adultre&s;s, he loved dearer than the whole world.</P>
<P>When Hewit left me it was his firm determination to go to India, and for that purpo&s;e he was, as he wrote, under weigh in the Downs in the Van&s;itart; and, to &s;ay the truth, this was a ma&s;ter &s;troke of Sourby, all who&s;e plea&s;ures were nothing unle&s;s the fruit of treachery, for as he hated Mrs. Vint, he wi&s;hed to deprive her of Hewit, that he might laugh at her, while he had me completely in his power.</P>
<P>But the lady who, in art, was at lea&s;t a match for the gentleman, cho&s;e to expo&s;tu|late
<PB N="31" REF="33">
with him upon this; and vowed &s;he would in&s;tantly acquaint me with every thing and &s;o di&s;concert all his &s;cheme, if he did not cau&s;e Hewit to be arre&s;ted when the &s;hip &s;hould arrive at Port&s;mouth, that &s;he, by &s;tepping in and relieving him, might make &s;uch merit of her friend|&s;hip as &s;hould induce him to be grateful.</P>
<P>This was accordingly done. Hewit was arre&s;ted at Port&s;mouth, and detained till the &s;hip had &s;ailed, and now good Mrs. Vint cho&s;e very opportunely to happen to be near at hand, and offered either to pay the money or get bail for him. The fir&s;t offer he did not cho&s;e to accept, for, indeed, he did not owe the money, being arre&s;ted upon a perjury. the other, how|ever, with &s;ome he&s;itation he did accept, and came to town; but, finding at length, too plainly what return &s;he expected for all this friend&s;hip, he not only revolted at the conditions, but began to &s;ee a mo|tive
<PB N="32" REF="34">
for believing that I might have been wronged.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he fluctuated, and actually made &s;everal attempts to find me; till, at length, when he was on the point of &s;urrendering him&s;elf to pri&s;on in ex|oneration of his bail, to get rid of the ob|ligation, my brother, the lawyer, &s;ent for him, as I mentioned before, acquainted him with the whole bu&s;ine&s;s from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and taught him how to laugh at the action, which was a fraud.</P>
<P>During all this time, by unfortunately taking too much precaution, I mi&s;&s;ed of my hu&s;band, and he of me; nay, the cir|cum&s;tance is a kind of miracle, for among the documents in the fatal che&s;t, I found a duplicate of the very new&s;paper in which I had, as the reader remembers, read an account of my brother's being condemned, and which contained, though probably
<PB N="33" REF="35">
from the &s;hock of &s;uch dreadful news, I I overlooked it, the following adverti&s;e|ment.</P>
<Q><P>A REPENTANT HUSBAND.</P>
<P>IF Hannah Hewit, wife of John Hewit, who with the mo&s;t unexampled cruelty left her to wretchedne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, without the &s;malle&s;t provocation, but in&s;tigated by calumny and treachery, will make known to her mi&s;erable and di&s;con&s;olate hu&s;band the place of her abode, &s;he &s;hall be &s;oon convinced that nothing but a train of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and diabolical art could have been the cau&s;e of his unpardonable conduct, and that it &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life, by tenderne&s;s and contrition, to merit her forgivene&s;s. A line addre&s;&s;ed to J. H. Salopian coffee-hou&s;e, will be remembered with the true&s;t gratitude.</P></Q>
<P>Searching further I found the trials of my brother the lawyer, and Sourby at length, in which every nerve was evidently
<PB N="34" REF="36">
&s;trained, by the whole gang, to &s;ave them. An alibi was &s;et up, &s;wearers on their part came to invalidate the evidence for the crown. Mrs Vint, who was taken up as an accomplice, turned king's evidence to have her full revenge on Sourby; and being &s;everely cro&s;s examined by the coun&s;el, grew &s;o exa&s;perated that &s;he threw a candle&s;tick at his head, for the trial la&s;ted from nine o'clock one morning till three the next, for which &s;he was committed for a contempt of court. In &s;hort, though I at the time heard not a &s;yllable of it, nor was Mr. Morris acquainted with it, who plodding on minded no bu&s;ine&s;s but his own, it was evident the town mu&s;t have rung of it.</P>
<P>Early in the trial it went hard with my brother; and, indeed, &s;uch a catalogue of black deeds came out again&s;t him, that the jury very &s;oon made up their minds. This was not exactly the ca&s;e in relation to Sourby, to who&s;e &s;uperior cunning after
<PB N="35" REF="37">
all my brother had been the dupe. Points of law were artfully thrown in the way of conviction, per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, par|ticularly a lord, appeared to give him the character of a gentleman, and a man of probity and honour; and though the bench, and, indeed the jury, con&s;idered him as the greater villain of the two, yet his crime was &s;o warily committed, and his defence &s;o artfully undertaken, that there was no bringing home to him the crime of forgery with intent to defraud.</P>
<P>Every power, however, in the brea&s;t of the judges, was &s;tretched to puni&s;h Sourby, and his &s;entence was to be tran|&s;ported to the coa&s;t of Africa for life. Nor did they &s;pare, in the pa&s;&s;ing this &s;en|tence, to mark his attrocity, nay, tho&s;e fa&s;hionable gentlemen, who appeared to glo&s;s over &s;o infamous a character, were &s;everely glanced at; and greatly to the ho|nour of the bench was this conduct. The
<PB N="36" REF="38">
poor wretch, who breaks a baker's window to &s;teal a loaf, that a &s;tarving family may &s;atisfy the cravings of hunger, mu&s;t be hanged; nor will a &s;ingle creature appear in his behalf, nor a coun&s;el plead his cau&s;e, for he is poor. The fa&s;hionable villain, who&s;e &s;tudy is dome&s;tic ruin, &s;hall have the fir&s;t legal abilities to &s;upport his cau&s;e, and per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction to give him a fair character, becau&s;e he is rich.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k, does an advocate think he &s;upports the honour of the bar by receiv|ing the brief and fee of a client who&s;e in|famous character he, in common with all the world, is acquainted with? Does a lord believe he has not uttered virtual perjury when he has given a man the cha|racter of hone&s;t and honourable, whom he knows has &s;pent many, many thou&s;ands, without ever having received a &s;ingle &s;hil|ling in his life that he has either earned or inherited.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">
To crown this bu&s;ine&s;s, I cannot re|frain from mentioning a letter of Mrs. Vint to Sourby in an&s;wer to one, where he upbraids her for becoming king's evidence. She mo&s;t triumphantly glories in the pro|&s;pect &s;he has of &s;eeing him hanged; &s;he ridicules him for one, who in the progre&s;s of his nefarious profe&s;&s;ion, had acted like an idiot and a bungler; upbraids him for not leaving Hewit to her management; telling him that his malignant mind could never bear that any per&s;on &s;hould receive a &s;atisfaction but him&s;elf. She laughs at him for the folly of having &s;o often mi&s;&s;ed the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns upon me. She anticipates all the mortification and all the ignominy he is to &s;uffer. She tries him, ca&s;ts him, condemns him, puts the halter round his neck, draws the cap over his eyes, and at la&s;t, with a mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everation, that the declaration comes from the bottom of her &s;oul, &s;he vows &s;he would give a year of her own life to have the plea&s;ure of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the
<PB N="38" REF="40">
hangman. Then to fini&s;h all &s;he adds, 'But what was to be expected of one who&s;e father, an Iri&s;h White Boy, was called mur|dering Murdoch, and who&s;e mother left the more creditable purlieus of Billing&s;|gate to &s;upport an infamous life by betray|ing innocence to pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, upon reading this, did Heaven direct its vengeance. It could no longer wink at &s;uch complicate, &s;uch mon&s;trous villainy, but &s;ent that &s;hark, at once its mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice to puni&s;h him, and of mercy to protect me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. LEO BECOMES VERY USFEUL; HANNAH TURNS BUILDER, AND ERECTS THE SHELL OF A VERY ELEGANT STRUCTURE.</HEAD>
<P>MANY other documents did I di&s;cover, which, however, are of no further mo|ment to the reader, than as &s;erving for a corroboration of all I have related; and now, having let two months elap&s;e with no other employ than fea&s;ting my mind with a food it devoured and nau&s;eated, I became collected enough to look round me and &s;ee in earne&s;t what plan I had be&s;t adopt.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
Certainty is &s;o preferable to &s;u&s;pen&s;e, that I now began thus to rea&s;on with my|&s;elf: Suppo&s;e I had never di&s;covered the fatal che&s;t, how would it have mended my &s;ituation? I &s;hould have had rea&s;on to be|lieve that poor Hewit was yet alive. What then, as to him, but wretchedne&s;s of mind, mixed with the pangs of compunction? What, as to me, but &s;olitarine&s;s and uncertainty, while he was wandering through the world in &s;earch of her he would never find.</P>
<P>But to be &s;o near him and yet lo&s;e him! That pang was &s;evere, but it was inevi|table. The hand of Fate was in it, we were born to &s;eparate never to meet again; and I was in a better &s;ituation to ta&s;te the mi&s;ery, bitter as it was, where I could &s;ooth my own &s;orrows by the &s;weet re|collection that I had not de&s;erved them, than in a vain, idle world, where the tri|vial and unfeeling would have ridiculed a
<PB N="41" REF="43">
pious duty to which their pitiable and trifling minds were in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the the other hand, for &s;uch a &s;itua|tion I was not unmindful how many com|forts, as far as I was capable of comfort, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; in a de&s;olate i&s;land where one would think I &s;hould find nothing but danger and famine, I was &s;afe and in the mid&s;t of plenty. The riches of the ea&s;t courted my acceptance, and my faithful lion &s;ecured me from every peril.</P>
<P>My poor Leo who, mo&s;t fortunately for me, became my protector! for I &s;oon began to di&s;cover, though I had been pretty &s;ecure from annoyance before I emptied the &s;hip of her provi&s;ions, that having now &s;uch a magazine I &s;hould &s;oon have been overrun by depredators. As to the rats which I at fir&s;t wondered at, for they were European rats, I found upon recollection, they mu&s;t have come from the &s;hip, and, being few in number,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
might &s;oon be di&s;per&s;ed, but creatures now came about me of &s;everal de&s;crip|tions; nay, the &s;maller &s;ort of the mon|keys at la&s;t &s;cented my &s;tore.</P>
<P>Leo, however, &s;oon rooted them all; and, in a fortnight, I was ptetty well convinced I &s;hould have no further trouble. At fir&s;t, I own, I was very much alarmed, le&s;t his preying upon animal food, might one day or other make him forget his duty; but the&s;e apprehen&s;ions &s;oon cea&s;ed. I treated him exactly as I would a favou|rite cat, made palatable me&s;&s;es for him, and gave him no animal food but what I previou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed, which no doubt &s;often|ed his natural ferocity, for no lamb ever was &s;o gentle, no &s;paniel &s;o obedient.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance very probably con|tributed to the attention and fidelity I re|ceived from Leo. After I had had him about a fortnight, he pur&s;ued a kind of racoon, which turned round and defending it&s;elf,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
Leo &s;oon conquered him; but, exactly as I have known a rat turn in de&s;pair again&s;t a large dog, &s;o this na&s;ty animal, by way of a de&s;perate effort, flew at Leo's eyes, and fa&s;tened its talon &s;o deep into one of them, that I had great fear he would have lo&s;t the &s;ight of it. I turned occuli&s;t upon this occa&s;ion; and, by proper applications, made a perfect cure of him in the cour&s;e of &s;omething more than three weeks, and this the reader will readily grant, in&s;ured me his gratitude.</P>
<P>Under all the&s;e con&s;iderations, having balanced the good and the bad, having &s;een the folly of de&s;pair, the impo&s;&s;ibility of radical relief, the certainty of as much comfort as &s;uch a &s;ituation would admit, I fairly looked my fortune full in the face, and plainly &s;aw, all things con&s;idered, that mi&s;erable as I was, there were thou|&s;ands in the world infinitely wor&s;e off.</P>
<P>I had now been on this de&s;olate i&s;land
<PB N="44" REF="46">
exactly a year; and, having weathered the fir&s;t rainy &s;ea&s;on, and being not yet forty, there was little probability but I might &s;ee many more days pa&s;s over my head than would be welcome to me. In order to beguile the time, therefore, as much as po&s;&s;ible, I was determined to go upon &s;ome large plan, that I might fully em|ploy my mind, and give free &s;cope for my ingenuity.</P>
<P>Having made this my object of con|templation for many days, I at at la&s;t di|ge&s;ted every thing. Fir&s;t of all, I was determined to change my place of abode, for I had no doubt but living within the rock had been in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of the different illne&s;&s;es I had been af|flicted with, be&s;ides it was dreary and had a tendency rather to in&s;pire, than di&s;pel gloom. I, therefore, re&s;olved to erect a proper building, calculated for plea&s;ure and convenience, in a &s;ituation on the lawn which was &s;ufficiently &s;haded from
<PB N="45" REF="47">
the &s;outh &s;un, and &s;heltered from the north wind, with a large expan&s;ion of verdure that terminated, before me, with the pro|montary that I have already de&s;cribed to extend like a terrace and over look the &s;ea; on the right, with the ca&s;cade, and on the left, with tho&s;e maje&s;tic trees, tier upon tier, that made a large &s;egment of that na|tural amphitheatre into which the whole was &s;o beautifully formed.</P>
<P>I had a great deal to think of. A &s;light building would have been blown down by the fir&s;t hurricane, or wa&s;hed away by the rain; and though I had a va|riety of materials, it did not appear that they would &s;erve to erect any edifice proof again&s;t &s;uch accidents. I had an idea of planting trees and interlacing &s;pars, junk, and other things, &s;o as in time to make a firm wall, its foundation fairly rooted in the earth; but this would require time to bring it to perfection, and I wanted a
<PB N="46" REF="48">
place to re&s;ide in immediately, be&s;ides, there would be no ingenuity in it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t have a place, thought I, in which &s;trength &s;hall vie with &s;ymetry; which &s;hall evince ta&s;te, elegance, a know|ledge of proportion; that &s;hall at once brave the fury of the &s;torm, &s;tem the cour&s;e of the inundation, and yet be hand|&s;ome and ornamental.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved to build a wall of an oval form. My roof I was determined &s;hould be flat, with a low dome in the center; by this means I knew I &s;hould oppo&s;e &s;uch a body of &s;trength and roundne&s;s to the weather as would &s;o completely &s;helter me, that the wind and rain could find no lodg|ment from any quarter, and then I &s;hould be perfectly &s;ecure from all external ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>This &s;hell once completed, I planned
<PB N="47" REF="49">
to divide it within into a ve&s;tibule, a &s;a|loon, a &s;torehou&s;e, a kitchen, a chapel, and a dormitory; which &s;everal partitions would &s;erve to &s;trengthen it &s;till more, and give me opportunity, with perfect conve|nience to follow all my occupations, but I &s;hall fir&s;t de&s;cribe how I managed to erect the &s;hell,</P>
<P>I could have ca&s;t the whole wall in moulds in the nature of London Wall, or any other walls &s;urrounding great cities, but I cho&s;e rather to build it with brick and mortar. My brick I formed from that earth which lay about in plenty, and which I have before de&s;cribed as bearing a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the petun&s;e, with which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the kaolin, they in China make porcelaine. The kaolin admitting only of a &s;emivitrifica|tion, and the petun&s;e being capable of completely vitrifying. The&s;e bricks, I think, I formed upon a better principle
<PB N="48" REF="50">
than tho&s;e which are made in England, and this I &s;hall particularly de&s;cribe, as, perhaps, it may induce an imitation of my plan; and ill as the world de&s;erves at my hands, I am not &s;o churli&s;h as to, withhold any thing that can be of u&s;e to my fellow creatures, greatly as they have profited, though I have never done &s;o by my in|genuity.</P>
<P>As to mortar, I had noticed a part of the rock, indeed many parts of it, that had been fairly &s;laked at the commencement of the rainy rea&s;on. This was nothing more than lime rendered quick by the heat of the &s;un, who&s;e power, the rock con|taining a quantity of calcareous gas, had opened the pores and expelled it by calci|nation, exactly as the &s;ame operation is performed by fire.</P>
<P>I, therefore, got together a quantity of the&s;e lime &s;tones, thus almo&s;t ready burnt
<PB N="49" REF="51">
to my hands; as to the other ingredient, &s;and, there could be no difficulty of cour&s;e in finding that; and, with the&s;e materials, having fir&s;t made me a trowel, a level, and every nece&s;&s;ary tool for my purpo&s;e, I turned bricklayer, and built me an oval brick wall, &s;trengthened, occa&s;ionally, with bond timber, fifty-four feet by thirty-&s;ix, and thirteen feet high from the &s;urface of the earth, allowing two feet more for the foundation.</P>
<P>Before I could form my roof, it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould mark out my interior plan. I de&s;cribed in the center, a circle of eighteen feet diameter, I then formed it into an octagon, which I intended to call my &s;aloon, &s;o that there were eighteen feet left, either way towards the ends, and nine feet towards the &s;ides. The &s;pace for my door was towards the &s;outh, and the &s;pace between that and the &s;aloon formed a ve&s;tibule. On the other &s;ide,
<PB N="50" REF="52">
behind the &s;aloon, I had a &s;pace ex|actly the &s;ize of the ve&s;tibule, which I in|tended to make into a dormitory; and now having drawn the&s;e lines, there re|mained towards each end a &s;pace &s;omething in the form of the letter D. One of the&s;e, that towards the we&s;t, I &s;eparated exactly in the middle, one part to &s;erve for a kitchen, the other for a &s;tore-room, and the remaining D, I intended to u&s;e as a chapel, the altar being at the end, and &s;tanding north and &s;outh.</P>
<P>At the point of every angle given me by the&s;e forms, I placed an upright, eleven feet high. I next formed my roof to dove|tail into the ends of the&s;e uprights, and in|termixed it with &s;maller quartering; and now I had got the complete &s;keleton of my building. My next bu&s;ine&s;s was to rai&s;e a dome from the octagon in the center, which I did by forming eight pieces of ba&s;ket work into gores, leaving four ap|pertures for a &s;kylight. The&s;e being placed
<PB N="51" REF="53">
in their proper &s;ituations, and drawn to a point, I laced them together, fir&s;t with oziers, and then afterwards with &s;mall cor|dage, after this I cut gores of the &s;ame &s;ize out of &s;ail-cloth; and having &s;ewed them &s;trongly together, they took the form of a cap for the ba&s;keting, &s;o that the whole was now a complete dome.</P>
<P>With the flat part of the roof I had very little trouble, for I fir&s;t nailed &s;ail-cloth over it, tarred, and afterwards cop|per; and now being covered in, I had no|thing to do but to enclo&s;e my apartments, and to decorate them.</P>
<P>I began with my dormitory, which I en|clo&s;ed every where with &s;ail-cloth, and hung afterwards with chintz, next I enclo&s;ed my kichen with painted &s;ail-cloth only, and furni&s;hed it with uten&s;ils made out of the &s;hip's copper; after this I fitted up my &s;tore-room, in the &s;ame manner, and this was
<PB N="52" REF="54">
all I was able to do, and to hou&s;e all my trea&s;ure, before the arrival of the birds, a &s;econd time, gave me notice that I mu&s;t make every thing wind and water tight again&s;t the approaching rainy &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that my wall was thirteen feet high, and that my ceiling was no more than eleven, &s;o that the flat part of the roof was not &s;o high by two feet as the wall, which formed a parapet round it. In order, therefore, to divert the rain, I had at given di&s;tances, left per|forations in the building of the wall like the &s;cuppers of a &s;hip, which were &s;ure to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The foundation of the building no wea|ther could injure. I had, therefore, no|thing to do but to look to the windows: of the&s;e there were two that looked into the ve&s;tibule, two into the kitchen, two into the &s;tore-room, one into my dormi|tory, and four into the chapel, be&s;ides four

others which were framed into the dome to &s;erve as a &s;kylight for the octagons.</P>
<P>Having found &s;everal of the cabin windows pretty &s;ound, which were, of cour&s;e, un&s;hipped early in the &s;torm, to make room for the dead lights, I re&s;olved to u&s;e them as far as they would go, know|ing that the &s;ame dead lights, in the &s;ame extremity, would again &s;erve to replace them. As to the &s;kylight, I was not able there to u&s;e gla&s;s at all, I, therefore, &s;tretched fine calico acro&s;s the appertures on the in&s;ide, having fir&s;t given it three or four complete coats of gum, &s;o as to ren|der it properly tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>I had now my kitchen, my &s;tore-room, and my dormitory entirely completed and furni&s;hed. I determined, therefore, to employ the &s;hort time that remained be|fore the rainy &s;ea&s;on, in getting eggs, catching young birds, and laying in &s;uch

<HEAD>CHAP. V. THE BUILDING GETS INTO A VERY FORWARD STATE, DURING ITS PROGRESS THE READER WILL HAVE REASON TO ADMIRE THE PERSEVERANCE AND IN|GENUITY OF HANNAH HEWIT.</HEAD>
<P>THE birds were now gone, and the rainy &s;ea&s;on began again to &s;et in, I therefore re|&s;olved to get ready the in&s;ide of my build|ing. I had paved my &s;tore-room and kitchen with large grey bricks, or rather tiles, as tho&s;e were places of common u&s;e; but having in my re&s;earches found earth of a variety of colours, that would mould into any form, I re&s;olved to floor the re&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="58">
of the apartments variou&s;ly, according to the u&s;es to which they were to be appro|priated.</P>
<P>My dormitory I rai&s;ed upon quartering and laid down in it a regular flooring of wood, for I con&s;idered that &s;leeping warm and comfortable would be greatly conducive to the pre&s;ervation of my health. Over this I laid &s;ail-cloth, and, again over that coar&s;e chintz; &s;o that it formed altogether a beautiful carpet. My bed furniture was made of a fine mu&s;lin &s;pread over a bed&s;tead in the form of a canopy, my bed was down, and my coverlid a clear mu&s;lin, worked in &s;ilks with ro&s;es and violets, and extended over a rich &s;traw-coloured taffeta. My toilette was compo&s;ed of a &s;prigged mu&s;lin, the co|lours lilac and green, which I &s;tretched over a pink taffeta, and the &s;ides of the room, as I mentioned before, being hung with a fine chintz, it formed upon the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
whole, an elegant and comfortable bed chamber.</P>
<P>I floored the ve&s;tibule alternately with black and white &s;quare tiles; and, having taken care properly to vein them in the moulding, it had all the effect of marble, I then hung it with &s;ail-cloth, as I had done the kitchen and &s;tore room, and over that pa&s;ted India paper.</P>
<P>My &s;aloon, which I meant to appro|priate to purpo&s;es of amu&s;ement, I re|&s;olved to decorate as neatly as po&s;&s;ible. I therefore formed a fancy floor, &s;ome|thing like mo&s;aic work, lined the dome fir&s;t with &s;ail-cloth, and then India paper cut into fanciful forms, and, afterwards, painted the &s;ides a pearl colour; which, as I intended to decorate it with pictures, I thought would have a &s;till and harmo|nious effect.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">
My chapel being an object of more attentive con&s;ideration than my other apartments, I re&s;olved to lay it out in a manner proper to in&s;pire devotion. The floor was mo&s;aic, but of a grander and more &s;triking kind than that of my &s;a|loon, the &s;ides, formed of &s;ail-cloth, I di&s;po&s;ed into compartments with an in|tention in time to fill them with paintings, the &s;ubjects taken from &s;cripture, and be|tween them appeared niches holding urns, on which I meant to place in&s;criptions, each &s;acred to the memory of &s;ome friend, or de&s;criptive of &s;ome event wherein the mercy of Providence had manife&s;ted it&s;elf in my favour.</P>
<P>At the back I erected a neat altar, and on the table laid the bible I had found in the fatal che&s;t, behind which I placed two &s;kulls and the bones of four arms in|te&s;ected as clo&s;ely as poffible as a memento mori. Reader, gue&s;s who&s;e &s;kulls and
<PB N="59" REF="61">
who&s;e bones the&s;e were! who&s;e could they be, to revive a wi&s;h that I had experienced a &s;imilar fate, but tho&s;e of the hu&s;band and wife whom I had found embracing each other, and embraced by death.</P>
<P>I did not inform the reader that a few days after I regained the cavern, I took a whole morning to inter the man|gled remains of tho&s;e poor wretches that the lione&s;s had &s;cattered upon the &s;and; at which time having found that unhappy couple in a &s;tate le&s;s mutilated than the re&s;t, I re&s;erved the&s;e &s;ad relicts to &s;erve for the &s;olemn u&s;e I had now put them to.</P>
<P>All this work, without any of the ornamental part, performed a little at a time, took me the whole of the rainy &s;ea&s;on, which &s;eemed to be &s;horter and le&s;s violent than the la&s;t. During its
<PB N="60" REF="62">
continuance, though I was, now and then, indi&s;po&s;ed and had a kind of agui&s;h fever, I cannot &s;ay I had any &s;erious illne&s;s; greatly owing, no doubt, to the comfor|table manner in which I was hou&s;ed, and al&s;o probably to my keeping my mind in continual occupation.</P>
<P>Le&s;t it &s;hould appear extraordinary that in nine months I &s;hould have brought a building of &s;uch magnitude to this &s;tate of forwardne&s;s, with no artificer in any one of the branches but my&s;elf, I will &s;hew that I found all I did ea&s;ily practicable.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, fir&s;t of all, be given me that I was perfectly mi&s;tre&s;s of every my&s;tery in building; which, after what the reader has known of me, will, I think, be very readily admitted. As to all the materials, except the brick and mortar, I was fur|ni&s;hed from the wreck with three times as much as I wanted. As to wood work, I
<PB N="61" REF="63">
had yards, &s;pars, &s;prits, booms, hand&s;pecs, marlin&s;pikes, and many other re&s;ources; and if I wanted any thing to bend into particular forms, canes and other acquatic plants in prodigious variety, grew every where around me,</P>
<P>The &s;hip's ropes were of very parti|cular u&s;e to me, for with them I inter|laced and bound every thing together, particularly about the roof, &s;o as to add con&s;iderably to its &s;trength, and then for iron work, I could not po&s;&s;ibly want that where there were &s;uch a plenty of ring bolts, rag bolts, fender bolts, boot hooks, fi&s;h hooks, foot hooks, can hooks, and cat hooks.</P>
<P>The difficulty, if there were any, &s;hould &s;eem to proceed from my inability to manage objects of &s;uch a ma&s;&s;y and ponderous kind; but this objection will be completely done away when it is con|&s;idered
<PB N="62" REF="64">
there is not a po&s;&s;ible re&s;ource again&s;t every inconvenience of this nature but is to be found on board a &s;hip; and if five or &s;ix men can navigate a ve&s;&s;el of two hundred and fifty tons in all weathers, take in her laden, di&s;charge it, weigh her anchors, cat them, and, in &s;hort, find them&s;elves equal to every nece&s;&s;ary la|bour, what difficulty could I po&s;&s;ibly find in removing a body of five, or &s;ix hundred weight to a &s;hort di&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is not &s;trength in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it is the multiplication of mechanical power. If I wanted to rai&s;e a perpendicular, I have already de&s;cribed, how ea&s;ily it was to be done by means of a tackle; which by the action and reaction of blocks, may be managed till the purcha&s;e &s;hall lighten five hundred weight to a feather.</P>
<P>If I wanted to haul any thing to a given di&s;tance, by de&s;cribing the nature
<PB N="63" REF="65">
of warping a ve&s;&s;el out of a harbour, or heaving up an anchor, which weighs &s;e|veral tons, exclu&s;ive of the pre&s;&s;ure of the water, uncalculable as to weight, and which may be done with ea&s;e by &s;ix or eight men, how very ea&s;ily mu&s;t I have been able to accompli&s;h the removal of &s;ix hundred weight by means of my cap&s;tern.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides I had a labourer, and a very able one. Leo, with two paniers upon his back, would carry me three thou&s;and bricks of a day; at la&s;t I made a cart for him, and fairly put him in harne&s;s; and &s;uch was his gratitude to me, that no racer at Newmarket, on whom thou&s;ands were betted, or &s;et of ponies in Hyde Park, who paraded with the toa&s;t of the day, for Heaven knows every modern toa&s;t is al|mo&s;t an ephemeron, could prance along with more pride, or more grace than did this noble creature.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66">
I confe&s;s after all that my per&s;everance was beyond credibility; but without it, nothing is to be accompli&s;hed, and with it, almo&s;t every thing. My labour &s;olaced me, and it is well it did, for my mind was naturally &s;o active and &s;o continually a&s;piring, that had I not cheated myfelf of grief, by giving every encouragement to its activity, I &s;hould either have &s;addened into melancholy, or have been exa&s;perated into di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Nor can I charge my&s;elf with any thing romantic, extravagant, or unbecoming. Why &s;hould I be a churl and refu&s;e to profit of the trea&s;ure Fortune had thrown in my way. I don't think that any her|mit ever &s;lept upon mo&s;s who could get down; and though I believe in my con|&s;cience that I &s;hould be the being of all others that could &s;it down ea&s;ie&s;t contented with the poore&s;t lot; yet, though I have &s;o little of that envy in me, which I for|merly
<PB N="65" REF="67">
de&s;cribed, that the tran&s;lation would &s;carcely excite in me a &s;mile, I cannot &s;ay I &s;hould find any reluctance in exchang|ing with the riche&s;t.</P>
<P>To be plain. Even though ob&s;curity and oblivion were to draw an eternal veil over me and my &s;tory, whether my days were to be few or many, &s;till was there nothing reprehen&s;ible in my per&s;everance. A tendency to pre&s;erve my health, to glo|rify him who gave me endowments, by a continual exertion of them, to con&s;ider that in a mortal to repine is to rebel, in &s;hort, in every moral &s;en&s;e, correctly and con&s;cienceou&s;ly to do my duty, and to &s;trengthen my&s;elf again&s;t every trial, could have nothing in it blameable or unworthy, and even if the ambition of making known the merit of my various &s;ufferings, my ir|reproachable love, or my uncommon for|titude, made a part of that &s;trong de&s;ire to
<PB N="66" REF="68">
di&s;play tho&s;e abilities, &s;uch as they were, with which Heaven had endowed me, though &s;uch ambition &s;hould never be gratified, I had not done the &s;malle&s;t in|jury to the meane&s;t worm; and, there|fore, could find nothing with which I had a right to reproach my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed, if my labours were to have ex|cited all the world to vi&s;it my i&s;land as in admiration of a prodigy, I could not have pur&s;ued them with a more unremitted at|tention, nor could I get rid of the idea, that though &s;o much love, &s;o much forti|tude, &s;o much patience, &s;o much re&s;igna|tion, had been manife&s;ted in vain, as to the benefit of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, yet the&s;e ex|emplary qualities would not be exerci&s;ed in vain, as to the benefit of the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VI. HANNAH HAVING BUILT A HOUSE WANTS A GAR|DEN; SHE ACCOMPLISHES HER WISH, AND GETS VERY FORWARD IN HER DIFFERENT STUDIES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;o far &s;ucceeded in a building calculated &s;o well for u&s;e and plea&s;ure, I re&s;olved to relax a little and pur&s;ue amu&s;ement, and labour, turn by turn. The rainy &s;ea&s;on being now over, and my ha|bitation having pretty well &s;tood that and the &s;torm that accompanied it, I began again to ta&s;te that air in which flitted a thou&s;and perfumes, and to regard tho&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="70">
objects, which renovated by nutritious moi&s;ter, felt additional &s;trength and looked more beautifully verdant.</P>
<P>And now it &s;truck me that having a hou&s;e I ought to have a garden. To be &s;ure no plea&s;ure ground was ever laid out by capability&mdash;Brown with more grandeur, or &s;tocked with more beautiful &s;hrubbery, than the &s;plendid expan&s;e both behind and before my hou&s;e; but orange trees only bore oranges, citron tree, citrons, and &s;o on. I was determined, by innoculation, grafting and inarching, to make the ca&s;&s;ia tree bear olives, the &s;haddock teem with pomgranates, and the plantain bend with clu&s;ters of tamerinds.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides I had found in the &s;hip a mul|tiplicity of flower &s;eeds, all cla&s;&s;ed and named, which were intended for the gar|dens at Ver&s;ailles. Then I had bulbes, tuberous, and other roots, and layers, and
<PB N="69" REF="71">
&s;uckers, and offsets. With the&s;e how well I might &s;tock a flower garden? And again I had potatoes, beans, peas, onions, garlick, and a variety of other articles with which the French &s;tuff their &s;oup maigre, and their &s;auces, and which would, of cour&s;e, form a very pretty variety for my kitchen garden.</P>
<P>In &s;hort I &s;oon made a hoe, a rake, and a &s;pade; and having determined to devote fir&s;t two hours in a day, and, afterwards, an hour or &s;o occa&s;ionally, in the cour&s;e of a month I began every way to feel the benefit of my labour, for it being the kind of exerci&s;e in which I ever took delight, an employ peculiarly calculated to in|&s;pire moral ideas, and fit the mind for the pure&s;t of contemplation, it gave me bo|dily and mental health, and agreeably &s;et off the value of my other occupations.</P>
<P>I had certainly now employment
<PB N="70" REF="72">
enough on my hands. I gardened, I wrote, I painted, I played on the the guit|tar, or the mandoline, I carved, I mo|delled, in &s;hort I did whatever nece&s;&s;ity or inclination induced me to, and it is be|yond credibility, &s;olaced by &s;o many amu&s;ements, all of them rational; how &s;trongly my mind bore up again&s;t its troubles.</P>
<P>I never in my life, as the reader mu&s;t have &s;een, could bear to pa&s;s an idle mo|ment. If I was in view of nature, I contem|plated her beauties. If night hid her from my eyes, &s;till was &s;he in mind, and &s;till was I forming projects to manife&s;t her various perfections. I cannot &s;ay I could go &s;o far as Sir John Fielding, who &s;aid in my pre&s;ence, "that he was glad he was blind, becau&s;e it gave him more perfect oppor|tunity for contemplation." But, I think, were it the plea&s;ure of Providence to afflict me in any way, I &s;hould as much as it is
<PB N="71" REF="73">
in the power of a human being, find &s;ome re&s;ource to &s;upply the deficiency, like the provident ant, who does not &s;tay to la|ment that her habitation is de&s;troyed, but who immediately con&s;iders through what medium &s;he can form a new one.</P>
<P>Solomon tells the &s;luggard to go to the ant, miracle certainly of indu&s;try! He might have told the ignorant to go the bee, as great a miracle of ingenuity. I have a thou&s;and times thought what an ad|mirable in&s;tance of &s;hrewd contrivance it is that the cells of a honeycomb, taking a hexangular form, the whole &s;pace is not only occupied in a way the mo&s;t con|venient to its inhabitants, but there is not the &s;malle&s;t room, no not the thickne&s;s of a hair lo&s;t or confounded. But were I to go on in this &s;train, I could expatiate for ever, and yet find no ob&s;ervation worthy the wonderful theme. Wonderful indeed! From the very &s;pider, who waves his en|trails
<PB N="72" REF="74">
into a net to catch his prey, to the obliging &s;ilkworm, who &s;pins away his &s;ub&s;tance that the coquette may catch her's</P>
<P>Though I have been betrayed into this rap&s;ody, I mean nothing more by it than that, with ingenuity, method will ac|compli&s;h any thing. I ever found it &s;o, and it was peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary, in my pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, to put my wits to the te&s;t, and thus I was enabled to perfect &s;o many things, which, but for the explanations I have gone into, would have appeared incredible; but, which, thus explained, the reader will allow mu&s;t have been ea&s;ily practicable.</P>
<P>I had found aboard the Entrepreneur, as before noticed, a great variety of co|lours for painting; but, be&s;ides this, I had now made from earth, bones, flowers, the blood of the &s;ea &s;nake, and other ma|terials,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
&s;ome admirable colours of my own. Oils, and varni&s;hes, I had brought to &s;uch perfection, that I had no doubt but in time I &s;hould rival the famous var|ni&s;h in which the beautiful tone of the cremona fiddle is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus I was completely &s;tocked with materials for painting. As for mu&s;ic, I had a harp, a guitar, a mandolina, two fiddles, &s;everal flutes, and a viol di gamba, be&s;ides a very large a&s;&s;ortment of &s;trings, both in catgut and wire, and, as I was determined to make a piano-forte for my &s;aloon, I had no doubt in the end of fitting up an organ in my chapel.</P>
<P>As for writing, I had a long time abandoned the plantain leaf, being well &s;upplied with pen, ink, and paper; and thus I was now prepared to write my hi&s;tory, to paint it, and to &s;et it to mu&s;ic, and all this I was determined in &s;ome
<PB N="74" REF="76">
degree to perform even, as I have re|peatedly &s;aid, though time &s;hould bury me and my labours in the &s;ame oblivion.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as the works of &s;uch &s;uperior authors as Shake&s;peare, and Mil|ton, make their way to the public through the medium of paintings and engravings, what chance would a narrative of &s;imple though extraordinary facts &s;tand of being introduced to the world, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the pencil or the graver. Again, as every thing written by ladies is expected to teem with poetry, particularly &s;onnets, it &s;truck me that a few &s;tanzas now and then &s;et to mu&s;ic, would throw in a novelty which might give it a fillup and &s;end it more rapidly into circulation. To be &s;ure it is but a &s;orry mode of recommendation, it is like &s;weetening with mola&s;&s;es; which, though plea&s;ant to the palate, is loath|&s;ome to the &s;tomach and conceals the flavour of the beverage; but as poor Walme&s;ley would have &s;aid had he been
<PB N="75" REF="77">
alive and heard me make the remark, all this we mu&s;t do to comply with the ta&s;te of the town.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I have not the &s;malle&s;t wi&s;h to in&s;inuate any thing again&s;t the re&s;pective merits of arts, or arti&s;ts, my quarrel is that nothing &s;tands upon its own foundation The world will not take for granted, the naked beauty of the object that pre&s;ents it&s;elf. It mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed, and Heaven knows it is &s;ometimes &s;o dre&s;&s;ed, that what was meant to orna|ment and embelli&s;h &s;erves only to caraca|ture and di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>A literary production, a painting, or any other work of genuis &s;hould make its own appeal to the public. Its merits will manife&s;t them&s;elves without the aid of ad|ventitious a&s;&s;i&s;tance; its demerits no ad|ventitious a&s;&s;i&s;tance can bol&s;ter up. An execrable poem, at which the public has
<PB N="76" REF="78">
been in raptures, &s;tands a chance of failing through the medium of a print that laughs at any reigning folly, and an admirable play, on the point of being damned; may work out its &s;alvation by the oppor|tune appearance of a gho&s;t, or an ele|phant.</P>
<P>But I reconcile it this way&mdash;Engli&s;h|men will have a good deal for their mo|ney, and to &s;ay truth, how can it be ex|pected that they &s;hould purcha&s;e a work of literature, be it the hi&s;tory of the bible, of their own country, of the Catabaws, of plants, of the heavenly con&s;tellations, of mites, of air, unle&s;s circulated through the medium of &s;ixpenny numbers, with the united advantages of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the whole body of arts, when the quartern loaf is at the enormous expence of &s;ixpence three farthings.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations induced me to en|force
<PB N="77" REF="79">
the particulars of my hi&s;tory in every po&s;&s;ible way that the fertility of my ima|gination would permit me; and as the fatal che&s;t, which contained &s;o many in|tere&s;ting documents, relative to poor Hewit, had furni&s;hed me with &s;ad proof of the mo&s;t material facts my hi&s;tory con|tains; &s;o I was determined to depo&s;it my labours there, that the world, if ever they &s;hould be di&s;covered, might learn through that medium a &s;tory which, though extra|ordinary enough in it&s;elf, might, perhaps, become more worthy of attention when &s;o many fortuitous circum&s;tances &s;hould lend it weight and re&s;pon&s;ibility.</P>
<P>I own I had one objection to cramming every thing into the che&s;t, and it was this. One of tho&s;e poets who, in my pro&s;perity, I taught to impo&s;e upon the public, had made a large &s;um of money by publi&s;hing Fac Similes of writings, drawings, and other documents &s;aid to have been found in a trunk, and actually written by the fa|mous
<PB N="78" REF="80">
Ben Jon&s;on, cotemporary of Shake|peare. Among the re&s;t there was a letter in Queen Elizabeth's own hand writing, commending one of tho&s;e ma&s;ques he is well known to have written for her court, and inviting him to attend the performance of it, facetiou&s;ly calling him, in imitation of Joh&s;on's character of Ju&s;tice Clement, in his &s;peech to Brainworm, "a merry knave."</P>
<P>Out of this che&s;t I al&s;o proved that Jon&s;on and Shake&s;peare were upon the be&s;t terms, and &s;o far from Jon&s;on's having ever &s;aid that in&s;tead of not blotting out a line Shake&s;peare ought to have blotted out thou&s;ands, there is a letter which expre&s;sly no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es that if any one could have the te|merity to &s;trike a &s;ingle word out of Shake|&s;peare, or to torture his meaning in any manner, it ought to be deemed literary &s;a|crilege.</P>
<P>What a &s;evere &s;atire, by anticipation,
<PB N="79" REF="81">
Jon&s;on had here written again&s;t Shake|&s;peare's numerous commentators, but I ought not to dwell upon this &s;ubject. I only introduced it to &s;hew how very &s;imi|lar, &s;ometimes, invention is to fact, and al&s;o, that though every body believed what I in&s;inuated, had they opened their eyes, they would have found that there was not one word of truth in it, for I did nothing more than retail over again the &s;tory of Chatterton.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t thing in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that which made the greate&s;t noi&s;e was a &s;ong, with which Ben Jon&s;on was &s;o delighted that he trea&s;ured it up as a model for rapturous love, though the in|telligent reader will plainly &s;ee it was as great an impo&s;ition as the re&s;t. I had, in|deed, an idea of &s;porting a play &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ent by Shake&s;pear to Jon&s;on for his opinion, but I &s;aw in a moment that it would only be &s;training the &s;tring until it &s;napt. A few loo&s;e things which bore the
<PB N="80" REF="82">
genuine marks of having been written by &s;o great a man, might be pretty well ma|naged, as they would naturally pa&s;s for what he con&s;idered as trifles, and probably intended to burn; but a play! No, no, thought I, the Engli&s;h may be credulous, but their credulity proceeds from the ex|ce&s;s of their good nature, their own in|herent integrity, and their willingne&s;s to admit what is &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly averred to be fact, not from their want of under&s;tanding, and critical di&s;crimination, upon either of which whoever gro&s;sly im|po&s;es, may be a&s;&s;ured of that re&s;entment his temerity &s;o richly de&s;erves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VII. HANNAH CELEBRATES THE ANNIVERSARIES OF ME|MORABLE DAYS, STUDIES CHEMISTRY, AND MAKES AN AUTOMATON. THE BIRDS AND THE MONKIES PAY HER ANOTHER VISIT, AT WHICH TIME LEO RESCUES HER FROM A PERILOUS SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD now full employ, all of which I might particularly enumerate were it not that if I did &s;o, my hi&s;tory would appear little better than a journal, and yet it is material to notice how much I gained upon time by keeping, in all I did, to an exact regularity, and how this mode va|varied my plea&s;ures as well as my em|ployments.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">
In the fir&s;t place, as there was &s;carcely a day of the year but marked &s;ome extra|ordinary circum&s;tance of my life, I always commemorated it by a form &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. My prayers, my food, my employ|ments, my very dre&s;s, &s;poke &s;omething analagous. Every di&s;tre&s;sful event was a fa&s;t, every providential e&s;cape a thank&s;|giving. Thus my poetry was heroic, pa|thetic, elegiac, pa&s;toral, &s;erious, or comic; my painting was grand, terrific, affecting, plea&s;ing, familiar, or caracature; my mu&s;ic was maje&s;tic, melting, magical in&s;inuating, &s;imple, or grote&s;que, according to circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>I had &s;o many memorable days to no|tice, that I divided them into cla&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e of a more intere&s;ting de&s;cription, &s;uch as Hewit's birth-day, my own, our marriage, our &s;eparation, his &s;hipwreck, mine, the day I landed on my i&s;land, my e&s;cape from the lione&s;s, and others, which the reader can point out as well as I, and
<PB N="85" REF="87">
which &s;hew what fragile tenements we inhabit, were among the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and were &s;uitably &s;olemnized.</P>
<P>But were I minutely to de&s;cribe the rotation of my calender, which was as nu|merou&s;ly &s;tocked, and I am as &s;ure as ho|ne&s;tly as the Pope's, it would be like &s;lyly intimating to the reader a recapitulation of the circum&s;tances of my life, le&s;t through inattention, or indifference, they might any of them have been pa&s;&s;ed by.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay, therefore, that having no country but my own i&s;land, no world but of my own creating, no communication but with my own ideas, that I might not lo&s;e the exerci&s;e of that rea&s;on by which human creatures are di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;ome to their honour, &s;ome to their execration, be|yond all other animals, I made that coun|try, that world, that &s;ociety, out of what I had known and experienced; which had this advantage beyond living in an actual
<PB N="86" REF="88">
world, that, like the &s;alutary air of Malta, Ireland, and &s;ome other places, where noxious animals are not known to exi&s;t, &s;o neither envy. nor &s;lander, nor, indeed, one of the mental evils that i&s;&s;ued from Pan|dora's box dared to draw its poi&s;onous breath in the pure atmo&s;phere of my do|minions.</P>
<P>I don't know how far the reader may be plea&s;ed with the&s;e trifling matters, but to me they made up a delightful, becau&s;e an inoffen&s;ive and rational &s;eries of enjoy|ments. It would have been, indeed, with me, to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; had I not found &s;ome ingenious means of cheating the tedious hours. I had no ambition to gratify that fools might wonder, I had no &s;um to ama&s;s for my heir to &s;quander, I had no dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s for my friends to envy, I did not lead a life, my life was all retro&s;pection; and had I not found employment for my faculties by contemplating as on a dream,
<PB N="87" REF="89">
or reading as in a book, pa&s;t occurrences of my extraordinary life, I mu&s;t have lin|gered on a vacant u&s;ele&s;s exi&s;tence; a liv|ing chaos, ab&s;orbed in a cha&s;m of time.</P>
<P>Employing my&s;elf, however, rather more rationally, as I had nothing to wi&s;h for but to join poor Hewit, and dared not accelerate the means; I thought I &s;hould render my life more acceptable to him who be&s;towed it by blending chearfulne&s;s with re&s;ignation; and, therefore, went on providing for what was to happen on the morrow, though that morrow was, which, by the bye, happens perpetually in the world, only a repetition of what had pa&s;&s;ed long before.</P>
<P>As in my retro&s;pective almanack two, and &s;ometimes three events would happen on the &s;ame day of the year, it generally introduced &s;ome extraordinary or whim|&s;ical coincidence; for in&s;tance, on the very day of the month Sourby had been
<PB N="88" REF="90">
&s;wallowed by the &s;hark did we thirteen years before receive the news that our for|tune had been &s;wallowed up by him and his confederates. The day of the year on which I had put the impudent monkey to death in the cavern, did I give a rude coxcomb, at a ma&s;querade, a &s;lap in the face. I had rea&s;on enough to remember it, for Hewit had like to have been in|volved in a duel.</P>
<P>On the day of the year I &s;aw the Queen of France in all her &s;plendour, was I by accident in a mob, where they were leading a poor wretch with a halter about her neck to be whipt at the cart's tail. The day of the year on which my brother, the lawyer, was hanged for forgery, he had been many years before honourably ac|quitted of a perjury, of which he was guil|ty, and Hewit had been fal&s;ely puni&s;hed for the crime of de&s;ertion, of which he was innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">
I &s;hall not dwell upon ob&s;ervations of this kind, I think the reader will be inte|re&s;ted in whatever relates to me; and if &s;o, it will not be a matter of indifference to learn that I filled my time by employ|ments worthy a mind made up to every extraordinary and trying occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the time the birds made their next appearance I had got wonderfully forward in all my undertakings. I had painted and framed twelve pictures for my &s;aloon, all &s;ubjects from my own life; four &s;crip|ture pieces were hung in my chapel, and I had gone into a number of other &s;tudies, particularly pneumatic chemi&s;try, in which I had made &s;ome wonderful di&s;coveries as to the nature of different ga&s;es; and among the re&s;t, I clearly proved by de|compounding water, that it is not an ele|ment but a compo&s;ition of two airs; and as a po&s;itive demon&s;tration of the truth of this experiment, by uniting the&s;e two airs, I recompo&s;ed them into water again.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
I heartily wi&s;h for the &s;ake of my fel|lows creatures, who&s;e welfare, though I &s;hall never witne&s;s, my heart, neverthele&s;s, yearns after, that &s;ome ingenious practi|tioner may have made the &s;ame notable di&s;covery; for though &s;imples and na|tural remedies are fully competent, to cure colds, fevers, and other common com|plaints, which many an old woman with Culpepper in her hand, has eradicated, as <HI>&s;ecumden artem,</HI> as the whole tribe of War|wick-lane could have done; yet, as luxury is every day adding to the catalogue of na|tural di&s;orders &s;o many artificial ones; as the mu&s;cles; of which medical men know but little, the nervous &s;y&s;tem, of which they know le&s;s, and the &s;pleen, of which they know nothing at all, are now &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;eat of complaints our ance&s;tors never heard of; &s;o it is but fair that galenical pharmacy &s;hould give way to chemical, and that vital fire, nearly ex|tingui&s;hed by the dinner and the bottle, &s;hould receive a prometheon renovation
<PB N="91" REF="93">
by chemical fire, i&s;&s;uing from the retort, or the crucible.</P>
<P>In particular I would recommend a clo&s;e attention to this doctrine of air; for as life depends upon re&s;piration, as the man who breathes free&s;t, loude&s;t and longe&s;t, is in the be&s;t health, as no man can breathe free, loud, or long, who inhales an air that di&s;agrees with his con|&s;titution, &s;o we have nothing to do but to pick and chu&s;e till we have found that air mo&s;t condu&s;ive to health, and thus breathe phy&s;ic in&s;tead of taking it in pills or by &s;poonfulls.</P>
<P>From Levoifier on chemi&s;try, I took mo&s;t of the&s;e hints; which books, toge|ther with many others on different &s;ub|jects, I found on board the Entrepreneur; but what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, was a work that treated on mechanics, a &s;tudy I was pecu|liarly qualified for, and in which I had
<PB N="92" REF="94">
ever taken delight, and which, indeed, in my &s;ituation, was more material to me than any other.</P>
<P>As I was ab&s;orbed in &s;tudy one day on the power of mechanical operations, ju&s;t after having &s;eparated the movements of a time piece, in order to clean it, it &s;truck me that I &s;hould find no great difficulty in making an automaton. I had &s;een the che&s;s player introduced with great &s;ucce&s;s about the year 1774, and knew perfectly upon what principle it acted, but this was not enough for me. To make any object mechanically come and go, and ape com|mon actions like Archytus's flying dove, Regiomontanus's wooden eagle, or his iron fly, was unworthy my genius, it was only the the &s;econd edition of Lady Ca|tharina with the magic lantern. I was determined to make an automaton that &s;hould &s;peak, and nothing appeared to me more ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95">
A common penny toy cries cuckoo as plain as the cuckoo it&s;elf; if, therefore, I had cho&s;e to content my&s;elf with keep|ing to open words the bu&s;ine&s;s would &s;oon have been effected; for in&s;tance, an auto|maton, or rather an autologon, might &s;oon be taught to &s;peak Italian, but I determined my automaton &s;hould &s;peak Engli&s;h; na&s;als, gutterals, and all. How I was charmed at the circum&s;tance! It would be a &s;ort of companion to me! It continually ran in my head, and I was de|termined to lo&s;e no time in bringing it to perfection.</P>
<P>To be brief, having made my figure and tried a variety of movements, I &s;ound, by adding a pair of bellows, I &s;hould, in time, in great mea&s;ure carry my point. The principal I went upon was that of a mu|&s;ical clock, which utters open &s;ounds through the medium of pent air conveyed occa&s;ionally into different pipes. In&s;tead, therefore, of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of regular &s;ounds
<PB N="94" REF="96">
forming a mu&s;ical melody upon the dia|pa&s;on, flute, or other &s;top producing notes by means of circular perforations, I made the &s;ounds i&s;&s;ue from reeds formed as near|ly as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;hape into which the fauces are pur&s;ed or dilated in the act of &s;peaking; and in&s;tead of tho&s;e tubes, from whence i&s;&s;ue the mellow even tone of the flute, and diapa&s;on, I made all my pipes in imitation of the vox humane, the clarinet, and the ba&s;&s;oon, all which have a &s;ound &s;omething re&s;embling the human voice.</P>
<P>As out of the common octave, with the addition of the &s;harp fourth, and the flat &s;eventh, may be formed a great variety of melody; or to come nearer the matter, as you may count the different changes upon eight bells until you are &s;tunned and tired; &s;o a great deal of conver&s;ation may be made out of a very few common place words. I pre&s;ently taught my figure a va|riety of interjections. He would cry out Oh, ah, humph, as correctly as a critic
<PB N="95" REF="97">
who was a&s;ked if he recollected a particu|lar beauty in Shake&s;peare; I made him &s;igh as naturally as a &s;elf approving Adonis who expected you to fall in love with him; he would whi&s;tle as vacantly as a da&s;hing fellow who had ju&s;t received a u&s;ele&s;s admonition from his injured fa|ther; and he would laugh as triumphantly as an impudent rake who had ju&s;t put mo|de&s;ty to the blu&s;h.</P>
<P>When I had brought my contrivance to this I &s;elected a few words, that by tran&s;po&s;ition and retran&s;po&s;ition would form different &s;entences; and by this me|thod, this kind of anagram in language, I made my figure conver&s;e pretty well. At fir&s;t I was wenderfully plea&s;ed with my contrivance, but there was &s;omething &s;o hollow and &s;o gho&s;tly in the &s;ound that, after a time, I grew perfectly &s;hocked at it, particularly at night; and having taught it to &s;ay 'O ow I luv u Anna;' it
<PB N="96" REF="98">
&s;poke, or I fancied it &s;poke, &s;o much in the tone of John Hewit's voice, who from a natural dialect pronounced with diffi|culty the a&s;piration H, that I began to fear it might introduce a melancholy which would trench upon all tho&s;e laudable re|&s;olutions I had &s;o properly and &s;o firmly made.</P>
<P>I, therefore determined, le&s;t my nerves &s;hould be affected, for a time at lea&s;t, to lay by my &s;peaking figure; and as the rainy &s;ea&s;on was likely to come on &s;oon, which never failed of it&s;elf by keeping me within doors, and depre&s;&s;ing my &s;pirits, to turn my mind too much to gloomy ob|jects, I placed it in a corner of my dor|mitory, re&s;olving never to u&s;e it unle&s;s when I could be &s;ure my re&s;olution would be equal to the trial.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e circum&s;tances can af|ford the reader but little amu&s;ement, I tru&s;t I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for having menti|oned
<PB N="97" REF="99">
them. To exerci&s;e my mind was my greate&s;t plea&s;ure, and my greate&s;t com|fort; and tho&s;e who have mo&s;t indulgence will be happie&s;t to find that a lone woman, who had not a &s;ingle motive for life, &s;hould have the fortitude, the prudence, the re|ligion to live mi&s;erable and re&s;igned.</P>
<P>I had now been two years and a half without &s;eeing a human face when the birds paid me a third vi&s;it. I took this hint to lay in my u&s;ual &s;tock, and pro|tected by Leo, who was now grown a mo&s;t beautiful animal, I &s;et about birds ne&s;ting in &s;pight of the monkies. I had been tollerably &s;ucce&s;sful, and had met with little annoyance for &s;ome time. I could not help noticing, however, a large ba|boon that leered at me from behind &s;ome rock or &s;tump of a tree, wherever I went. In vain did Leo &s;camper after him up the rocks, whenever he could he returned to the charge, and it is inconceivable how
<PB N="98" REF="100">
nau&s;eous and di&s;agreeable his antics were.</P>
<P>One afternoon, having di&s;patched Leo for a ba&s;ket of eggs I had left behind me, I was &s;itting on a cane garden chair before my door when that ugly wretch the baboon &s;urprized me. He caught me in his arms, and it was vain that I endeavoured to di&s;engage my&s;elf from his gra&s;p, I &s;creamed and rent the air with my cries, all hope &s;eemed in vain, and what might have been the con&s;equence Heaven knows if my noble protector, on hearing my voice, had not flown to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>To have &s;een him was to have &s;een a guardian angel. His generous tender|ne&s;s for me, and his ineffable contempt for his foe were in the &s;ame moment ma|nife&s;t in his eyes. It was like a gallant Engli&s;hman protecting innocence from di&s;tre&s;s. It was like Binns. He di&s;en|gaged
<PB N="99" REF="101">
the horrid wretch from me with the mo&s;t cautious care; then, &s;eeing I was &s;afe, terrified him with all the appre|hen&s;ion of death, and then, as if think|ing him too in&s;ignificant for his revenge, &s;purned at him and permitted him to e&s;cape.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. HANNAH EXPERIENCING DISAGREEABLE EFFECTS FROM THE RAINY SEASON, GETS FIRST INTO A CONSUMPTION, AND AFTERWARDS INTO THE HORRORS.</HEAD>
<P>THE birds having taken their departure, the rain &s;oon after &s;et in. I, therefore, betook my&s;elf to painting and ornament|ing, being determined to complete my building in every re&s;pect by the time it &s;hould be fine weather; after which, if I &s;hould want employ, I might build a plea&s;ure hou&s;e upon the mountain, where, by catching young ones, and breeding them up tame, I might keep deer and
<PB N="101" REF="103">
buffaloes in a &s;ort of kraal, or enclo&s;ure, in the manner they were kept by the Caffres.</P>
<P>I &s;et about my &s;aloon and &s;oon added &s;ix or eight pictures to my catalogue with their proper frames carved and gilt; in which la&s;t labour it is a&s;toni&s;hing what occa&s;ion I had to admire the maleability of gold. I beat out a &s;ingle louis d'ore into as many &s;lips or leaves as, by calcu|lation, had they been paper and converted into notes of only &s;ix livres each, would have amounted to &s;even thou&s;and one hun|dred and thirty-three livres.</P>
<P>I went on with great alacrity, but the rain being ince&s;&s;ant, and attended with a chilling air, I grew, I can't &s;ay ill, but impatient and gloomy. In this &s;ituation I took a wrong method. I thought, as I had found upon all occa&s;ions facing an enemy, to be the &s;ure&s;t way of getting rid
<PB N="102" REF="104">
of him, fancy never failing to magnify fear, &s;o I changed my ground, and in pro|portion as I grew melancholy, indulged my &s;adne&s;s by working in the chapel; and once or twice I was fool hardy enough to try the experiment of my &s;peaking figure, adding to it a new movement, in the na|ture of an alarum clock, by which it &s;poke at any given di&s;tance of time.</P>
<P>This la&s;t experiment I mo&s;t heartily repented, for it threw me into &s;uch a de|jection of &s;pirits, that I greatly feared I &s;hould have all the horror of the fir&s;t rainy &s;ea&s;on to go over again. I, there|fore, determined to put up the autologon for good and all. Nothing, however, could keep me out of the chapel; where, though dreadfully dejected, I was greatly relieved by prayer and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that the all &s;eeing eye of the Creator was benignly regarding me in a &s;acred place which I had mo&s;t uprightly con&s;ecrated to his honour.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">
The&s;e con&s;iderations at times greatly relieved me, and, in particular gave me &s;ome little comfort, by enabling me to ar|gue with my&s;elf. Why thought I &s;hould any fear, however awful, depre&s;s my &s;pirits? Am I now to learn that I am alone in a world which it is not material to my|&s;elf or to creation whether I leave now or when age and deformity &s;hall have ren|dered my life &s;till more a burden?</P>
<P>What &s;hall I do when the pangs of death are on me? When I am &s;inking to that re&s;t which alone can be the oblivion of my cares. Should I not betray a mind grovling and unworthy were I to weep that I have no kind friend to comfort me, no trembling hand to clo&s;e my dying eyes, no devout prie&s;t to admini&s;ter comfort to my parting &s;oul, or &s;ing a requiem over my grave, no charitable &s;exton to hide my peri&s;hable remains.</P>
<P>Rather let me in this, as in all other
<PB N="104" REF="106">
exigencies provide for the &s;olemn occa|&s;ion; and, having to the glory of that Cre|ator, who permitted me to exi&s;t, exerci&s;ed tho&s;e endowments he mercifully gave me to prolong my exi&s;tence, &s;o let me meet death with the fortitude that I have en|dured life.</P>
<P>Let me expect the dreadful and con|&s;oling moment when this world and all its glories &s;hall pa&s;s away from me. Should it be prompt, it will be but one pang; &s;hould it be lingering, let me with piety and re&s;ignation endure what cannot be averted; and when at la&s;t the icy hand of death &s;hall chill my forehead, let me re|tire to &s;ome mode&s;t tomb &s;uited to receive &s;uch humble remains.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how this la&s;t idea po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me. I determined at once to execute the de&s;ign I had formed; and after a few days, during which &s;pace I would &s;it and mu&s;e for &s;ix or eight hours
<PB N="105" REF="107">
at a time indulging my &s;ad, yet plea&s;ing melancholy, I began my work; and, in a week more, had erected a plain, neat tomb, ornamented with &s;uitable decorations, and an impre&s;&s;ive in&s;cription referring to the fatal che&s;t for further information.</P>
<P>Into this tomb, which was lined with black, I conveyed a couch with a kind of canopy, ornamented with &s;uch artificial leaves and flowers as be&s;poke my charac|ter. Like poor Ophelia, I had pan&s;ies for remembrance, and I had rue. The heliotrope be&s;poke my con&s;tancy, a whi|thered laurel denoted my unavailing de|&s;ire of fame, an olive de&s;cribed me at peace with all the world, camomile ex|pre&s;&s;ed my patient endurance of injury, the ephemeron, my tran&s;ient hope, and the xeranthemum, my never ending de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>Here did I determine, if my &s;trength

and re&s;olution &s;hould permit me, to en|clo&s;e my&s;elf whenever I &s;hould find my di&s;&s;olution approach; after which, whe|ther my retreat were ever to be di&s;covered or to remain a &s;ecret from all the world, I &s;hould have done a becoming duty to|wards God and towards man.</P>
<P>I never atchieved any thing of this ex|traordinary kind but it con&s;oled me. I now begin to think of death as calmly as I had formerly indulged the idea di&s;tract|edly; and for &s;everal days, I was in a tem|per to re&s;ign my life without a &s;igh. The next thing that &s;truck me was that poor Hewit merited a tribute of re&s;pect at my hands; and, as I had placed my tomb on one &s;ide of the altar, I re&s;olved to erect one for him on the other. This I al&s;o accompli&s;hed, but had &s;carcely done &s;o, before I was well convinced I had better have let it alone.</P>
<P>My mind that I had flattered with fal&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="109">
hopes, was not con&s;oled, it was deceived; and while I delu&s;ively fancied I had been admini&s;tering relief to my de&s;pair, I was only confirming it. I had not noticed, in the eagerne&s;s of my employment, that too great an exertion of re&s;olution impaired my health; that every &s;igh, as it came from my heart, affected my lungs; in &s;hort, un|der the idea of a cough, I felt, at la&s;t, every &s;ymptom of an approaching con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>I lo&s;t &s;trength every day, and by the time the rainy &s;ea&s;on was over, I was a perfect &s;keleton. Having now an oppor|tunity of taking the fre&s;h air, with all tho&s;e beautiful advantages that I have formerly de&s;cribed, though wa&s;ting perceptibly, I hoped I might yet recover, &s;till mindful, however de&s;irous of death, it was my du|ty to prolong my life by every means in my power.</P>
<P>I had an idea that if I could frequent|ly
<PB N="108" REF="110">
take the air on the mountain, it might lend &s;ome help towards re&s;toring me; but how to get there? I could no more have climbed the mountain than have flown to it. At la&s;t it &s;truck me that Leo &s;hould convey me; for which purpo&s;e I mounted a garden chair upon a carriage; and hav|ing put him on a beautiful &s;ilk harne&s;s, the good creature, who&s;e very look conveyed affection and fidelity, drew me with an air &s;o proud and maje&s;tic, that I &s;eemed &s;ome deity in her car. Alas, it was only in appearance! for had the Deity felt &s;o weak and &s;o emaciated as I did, &s;he would have preferred annihilation to im|mortality.</P>
<P>Our journies were long or &s;hort ac|cording to circum&s;tances. Sometimes we merely took an airing, and &s;ometimes we &s;tayed all day, and took provi&s;ion with us. One day having been on a long tour, as we returned towards the evening, I &s;aw &s;omething &s;truggling in a thicket; and
<PB N="109" REF="111">
alighting, I di&s;covered that it was a young buffalo. It in&s;tantly occurred to me that veal broth was a very nouri&s;hing thing, and proper for a per&s;on in a con&s;umption, and had no doubt, e&s;pecially as I had ta&s;ted nothing of that kind for &s;uch a length a time, it might greatly contribute towards my recovery, &s;o flattering is the nature of that complaint, that it catches more at &s;traws than any other.</P>
<P>I di&s;entangled the poor creature and began to deliberate about killing it; but I plainly found I &s;hould make but a very indifferent butcher. Leo, indeed, if I had given the word, would have lain him dead in an in&s;tant; not el&s;e, for I verily be|lieve, unle&s;s by my command, which was to him a fiat, he would not, unle&s;s pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, have killed a fly. At all adventures I thought it was better to po&s;tpone &s;o di&s;|agreeable a bu&s;ine&s;s till we &s;hould get home, &s;o I made a halter for the poor
<PB N="110" REF="112">
trembling thing, and led him on behind my carriage.</P>
<P>It being late I penned my calf up till the morning; when after con&s;idering the matter the major part of the night, I was fallying forth to relea&s;e him and to tru&s;t to chance for my cure, uttering as I went along, no; life is as precious in that creature as it is in me, let me pre&s;erve his life and tru&s;t to Providence to re&s;tore mine.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the&s;e words i&s;&s;ued from my mouth, when I heard an uncommon bellowing. It was the mother of the poor creature who had traced his foot&s;teps from the mountain. Oh how did I here ex|ult! How much more nutritious than veal broth was milk, how much more proper for a con&s;umptive complaint, and then I &s;hould take away no life, truly here had virtue its reward; I had been merciful to
<PB N="111" REF="113">
the calf, and Heaven in return had been merciful to me. Well charming Sbake&s;|peare, ha&s;t thou &s;weetly &s;aid that 'mercy is twice ble&s;t.' I have often con&s;idered that pa&s;&s;age as one of the mo&s;t &s;ublime in all the works of our great bard. Nay, I am extremely deceived, if the celebrated Mi&s;s Seward is not of the &s;ame opinion; for if I recollect right, one of her poems, which de&s;cribes &s;ome character full of benignity, has this line&mdash;<Q><L>"With all the twice ble&s;&s;ed Angel in her eye."</L></Q></P>
<P>After I had permitted the calf to &s;uck its fill, and thus continued to prolong life in&s;tead of de&s;troying it, I milked the mother. I then permitted her to graze about the lawn, being under no apprehen|&s;ion of lo&s;ing her while I confined her young one. Thus, after a &s;hort time, &s;he became very tractable, and &s;uffered her|&s;elf to be milked twice a day as regularly as an Alderney cow.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">
In the mean time the milk very &s;en&s;i|bly gained upon my di&s;order, and in about &s;ix weeks from the time I fir&s;t drank it, I found my&s;elf in a convale&s;cent &s;tate, but though I had no doubt with care I &s;hould recover, &s;till a na&s;ty hectic fever lurked about me; my fle&s;h perpetually burnt, I had a weak, low, and quick pul&s;e; my &s;leep was no manner of refre&s;hment, but on the contrary was attended with &s;tartings and frightful dreams.</P>
<P>Had I not known that this fever was an attendant on a con&s;umption, and that the&s;e dreams were &s;ymptoms of it, I &s;hould have been tempted to believe &s;ome awful event was at hand; for I &s;carcely ever &s;lept but &s;ome my&s;terious vi&s;ion ap|peared to me. Hewit, my brother, Binns, Walme&s;ley, Sourby, were perpetually &s;wimming before me in &s;o many fanta&s;tic &s;hapes, that when I awoke I &s;eemed to be on the verge of madne&s;s; nay, at la&s;t, I
<PB N="113" REF="115">
began to think very &s;eriou&s;ly of the&s;e ex|traordinary warnings, and felt a mixed &s;en&s;ation of hope and dread, that my di&s;|order would return, and that the next rainy &s;ea&s;on, or, perhaps, a &s;horter period, would find me &s;ilently reclined in my tomb.</P>
<P>My con&s;umption certainly went off and with it all the &s;ymptoms of the fever except the dreams which increa&s;ed in a mo&s;t wonderful manner; willing however, to con&s;ult my &s;en&s;es and my rea&s;on, and thus attribute the&s;e vi&s;itations to their na|tural cau&s;e, I concluded that, as in con|&s;equence of being convale&s;cent, I had grown more plethoric, from thence had ari&s;en tho&s;e horrid dreams, which certainly were now become of a more &s;anguinary kind, and related to nothing but wounds and murder.</P>
<P>Under this idea, I ab&s;tained from too
<PB N="114" REF="116">
much food that had milk in it, or any other ingredient likely to engender blood too fa&s;t. This &s;eemed actually to have its effect, and for a fortnight, I &s;lept much le&s;s di&s;turbed and found my&s;elf in better health.</P>
<P>I had come home one evening pretty tired, and having made rather a heartier meal than u&s;ual, I re&s;ted the fir&s;t part of the night very &s;ound. Towards the morn|ing I dreamt I &s;aw poor Leo full of wounds and breathing his la&s;t. I was crying for the lo&s;s of him when John Hewit knelt by my &s;ide, and with a thou|&s;and &s;oft and tender expre&s;&s;ions, entreated me to go with him to where he &s;aid we &s;hould both be happy.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o winning, yet &s;o repugnant, as I thought to my wi&s;hes, in his &s;olicitations, that I alternately re|pul&s;ed and carre&s;&s;ed him. At la&s;t, my mind being wrought up to a violent con|flict,
<PB N="115" REF="117">
I awoke, when, hardly knowing where I was, and doubting whether what I had &s;een and heard was a dream or re|ality, a hollow voice, like that I had heard in my dream, cried out&mdash;"A ow I luv u Anna!"</P>
<P>Upon hearing the&s;e &s;ounds uttered &s;o unexpectedly, I &s;creamed and fell into &s;trong hy&s;terics, which, though I was in my &s;en&s;es the whole time, and knew they had been uttered by the &s;peaking figure, in con&s;equence of my having, by mi&s;take, &s;et the alarum movement the night before in&s;tead of taking it off, la&s;ted me a com|plete hour; and when I recovered, though I found Leo &s;afe, and that the &s;ounds had been cau&s;ed by my own imprudent negli|gence, I was &s;o &s;hocked that I continued ill the whole day, and was obliged to mu&s;ter up all my firmne&s;s, and to call to mind how many reiterated re&s;olutions I had made, to rely on the protection of
<PB N="116" REF="118">
Providence, before I could prevail on my|&s;elf to go to bed at night.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits were &s;o un&s;ettled that my horrid dreams began to return, I dreamt that the owners of the French Ea&s;t-India|man came to &s;trip me of all I had, and told me I mu&s;t re&s;tore my goods to their rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In a &s;tate of di&s;trac|tion, I thought I flew into the chapel, where the &s;kulls of Mon&s;ieur and Ma|dame D'Oliviere &s;poke to me, crying out, "Li&s;ten to us, we are Oracles, you &s;hall be tran&s;lated to Heaven, and reap a ju&s;t reward for all your &s;ufferings." Then they thanked me for my pious care of their re|mains; then flew to ki&s;s me; Oh what a nau&s;eous &s;en&s;ation! It awoke me; I feel the clamy pre&s;&s;ure of their hollow jaws at this moment.</P>
<P>From this night I determined to bid adieu to &s;leep. Yet what was to &s;u&s;tain nature? No matter; the &s;ooner my ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="117" REF="119">
terminated the better! this might be impiety, but I could bear no more than the mind I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed permitted. I was a mortal, and, therefore, could boa&s;t no more than the imbecility of a mortal. The &s;tring of my re&s;olution had been wound up until it had cracked, the mu&s;ic of hope was turned to the di&s;&s;onance of de&s;pair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX. HANNAH'S DISTRESS BECOMES MORE AND MORE POIGNANT: SHE MEETS WITH A MOST AFFECTING LOSS, AND AFTERWARDS TAKES HER LEAVE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD continued in this dreadful de&s;pond|ency ten or twelve days; now &s;hivering with apprehen&s;ion, now wild with terror, now lowered with &s;ullen melancholy, now melted into tears, the whole time not dar|ing to &s;leep but at fits and &s;tarts, when nature oppre&s;&s;ed me, and I &s;ettled into a kind of &s;erene &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>I had taken the matter every way, and
<PB N="119" REF="121">
nothing could convince me but that my fate was at hand. I, therefore, &s;at down camly to expect it. Having brought my mind to this, nothing could exceed the tranquility in which I felt my&s;elf. I in|dulged the idea, I fea&s;ted on it as on lux|ury, which received &s;uch a ze&s;t from re|flections on my blamele&s;s life, that I chid the tedious hours which &s;tood between me and the moment when I &s;hould find Hea|ven and John Hewit.</P>
<P>I took an examination of my life, from the moment of my birth up to that day, and while I regarded the &s;cenes I had ta|ken from it, which hung round me in my &s;aloon, I had fre&s;h rea&s;on for exultation.</P>
<P>Here, as the triumph of my virtue, hung a portrait of the gallant Binns re&s;cuing me from the violent hands of the villain Sourby. There, as an eternal reproach to the world and its follies, were Hewit and I in our new ridiculous dre&s;&s;es gazed at like me|teors,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
as we drove round the Ring in Hyde Park. Further on, as a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to fallen pride, and a picture of conjugal af|fection and hone&s;t indu&s;try, were we &s;al|lying forth, he as a razor grinder, and I &s;elling trinkets, and leading an humble a&s;s bearing my two children in paniers.</P>
<P>My receiving the fatal letter from whence originated all my &s;ufferings, the death of my poor &s;u&s;pected infant, my embarking for India, my meeting with my brother, my parting from him, my being &s;hipwrecked, my being torn from my com|panions, my finding Trout to be Sourby, his ju&s;t fate, my e&s;cape from the lione&s;s, Leo's exulation at having re&s;cued me from the monkey, all gave &s;ome proof of tender|ne&s;s, or re&s;olution, or affection, or forti|tude, or &s;ome other quality, which taught me I had de&s;erved to live and therefore was prepared to die.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e merits that had depended on my|&s;elf,
<PB N="121" REF="123">
led me into a reflection on the mi&s;eries I had been afflicted with, and which had depended on Providence. Not con|&s;cious that from my own neglect I had merited affliction, though I did not dare arraign Providence, I mode&s;tly took leave to &s;crutinize its motives; and having fairly weighed every con&s;ideration, and reflected that virtue can never be puni&s;hed by a power all ju&s;t, all good, all benefi|cent, but for its own &s;ake, I calmly con|cluded that Providence had made this world my &s;courge, my woe, my mi&s;ery, that I might the better reli&s;h tho&s;e joys which were preparing for me in the next.</P>
<P>Thus deeply reflecting, &s;edately weigh|ing, and, I am afraid, ab&s;urdly judging, what I had &s;hunned in &s;leep followed me waking. My life was all a dream, or ra|ther madne&s;s; for in&s;tead of my being &s;hocked at horrid images, the more horrid the image the more I was delighted.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">
My only di&s;turbance was the parting with Leo. I would look at him, and talk to him as if he had been endowed with rea&s;on, and, indeed, if actions are a proof of it, &s;o he was. Never did I trace in the noble creature an unworthy motive, would I could &s;ay &s;o much of humanity. Ah my poor Leo! Would I cry&mdash;while a flood of tears gu&s;hed from my eyes&mdash;I &s;hall leave thee in a trouble&s;ome world. I was the only inhabitant of this i&s;land of my kind, now thou will be the only one of thine. Thou ha&s;t followed me, watched me, and protected me. May thy blame|le&s;s life never know a pang. Alas he is delighted with my carre&s;&s;es! He tries to recall me to life. My good, my worthy, my faithful Leo, it is too late, we &s;hall part, indeed we &s;hall, very, very &s;oon.</P>
<P>Finding in all this time no material al|teration in my health, for with the other qualities of madne&s;s, I had cunning enough to eat and drink, I grew impatient. Come,
<PB N="123" REF="125">
&s;aid I, Leo, one day, let us go out and &s;eek that fate that will not come home to us. So &s;aying I &s;allied forth&mdash;Oh would I had not&mdash;my ever faithful Leo proudly follow|ing me.</P>
<P>I had wildly &s;trayed to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, when chance led me to the verge of the promontory, where I grew &s;o di&s;or|dered, that I had almo&s;t made up my mind to leap forward. At this in&s;tant a hideous baboon ru&s;hed from the very brake whence the lione&s;s had formerly flown to &s;eize me. Leo, delighted with being per|mitted to follow me, was &s;campering over the lawn. He &s;aw in a moment my danger, and flew like lightening to my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. He roared, his eyes fla&s;hed fire, his rage was ungovernable, he darted at his prey, which venturing to avoid him, to the very edge of the promontory, they both fell over, and Oh mi&s;erable, mi&s;era|ble hour! my poor Leo &s;hared the fate of his mother!</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">
It was a mercy I did not follow him. I ran, I rambled, I ventured into the mo&s;t imminent danger to lend him a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, my &s;hrieks and lamentations all the while reverberated by a hundred echos, but in vain, he was dead; on a jet of the rock that no human art could approach, he lay &s;tretched by the &s;ide of his mother, who&s;e carca&s;e had been a prey to the birds, and who&s;e &s;keleton had whitened in the &s;un.</P>
<P>Now was I completely overcome, the terrible accident happening in my &s;ight, in my behalf, in my defence. Unaccu&s;|tomed as I was to kindne&s;s, and meltingly &s;u&s;ceptible of gratitude, my feelings ad|ded to the complication of conflicting &s;en|&s;ations with which I was before di&s;tracted, drove me to &s;omething more than mad|ne&s;s. As I wandered I &s;carcely knew where, I &s;creamed, I laughed, I &s;ung, and exhibited every &s;hocking di&s;traction of a mi&s;erable lunatic.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127">
All this while, my feet as much mi&s;led as my &s;en&s;es, I erred further and further from my home; and, in proportion as I found my&s;elf a&s;tray, my di&s;traction en|crea&s;ed. My ears were a&s;&s;ailed with a thou&s;and noi&s;es, the winds &s;eemed to whi&s;|tle with the harmony of fifty Eolian harps. I heard voices, I an&s;wered them, I fancied my&s;elf in the company of An|gels; till accident having placed me in the path that led to my hou&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an idea that the awful hour was ap|proaching, when the mercy of Heaven would &s;natch me from the mi&s;eries of earth, I &s;olemnly walked on, entered my building, bid a formal adieu to every ob|ject that had been intere&s;ting to me, went into my chapel, knelt at the altar, put up a pathetic prayer, embraced the &s;kulls, ki&s;&s;ed the name of John Hewit in the bible, entered my tomb, enclo&s;ed my&s;elf, reclined upon my couch, and in&s;tantly in death, lo&s;t the world and all its vanities.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. IN WHICH HANNAH HEWIT AND THE READER ARE INTRODUCED TO SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</HEAD>
<P>DEATH did I well call the &s;leep into which I had fallen on my entering my tomb. It la&s;ted me till the next morning, when I was awoke by a confu&s;ed noi&s;e
<PB N="128" REF="129">
that i&s;&s;ued from every apartment. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how &s;elf pre&s;ervation actuates the mind. My di&s;traction was gone, my recollection was completely returned; I knew where I was, and knew there was &s;ome cau&s;e at hand that demanded vigour|ous re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I thanked fortune that had led me to this tomb, perhaps, to pre&s;erve me. I plainly heard human voices, and re&s;olved to remain quiet that I might di&s;cover the truth. If tho&s;e I heard were friends, I had cau&s;e to thank Heaven that gave me an a&s;&s;ylum to offer them, if enemies, re|&s;pect for the dead would &s;ecure me an a&s;&s;ylum in the &s;ilent tomb.</P>
<P>I had not long to deliberate before two men entered the chapel. "Why, hollo! Jack," cried one, "we are aboard a church." 'I told you,' &s;aid the other, 'we &s;hould be brought up at la&s;t. You
<PB N="129" REF="130">
would not believe what I told you ye&s;ter|day. You thought as I had got too much beer aboard, but the thing was as I &s;aid.</P>
<P>'You &s;ee I was &s;trolling about to &s;ee how the land lay, thinking upon Jen Wil|liams, when I thinks, thinks I, that there before me is either a gho&s;t, or a devil, or a woman in a white gown. Now do you &s;ee, except a &s;hip under &s;ail, I does not think that the world can produce you a &s;ight &s;o lovely as a woman in a white gown.</P>
<P>'Well, you &s;ee I gave chace, and for a time &s;tood after her pretty well; but &s;he, having a better chart of the cour&s;e than I, hauled her wind and &s;tood for &s;ome new cut, that I had not the &s;kill to to weather; &s;o, being obliged to double a point of land, I made &s;o many trips that at la&s;t I found':&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
"My eyes," &s;aid the other, "what a place this is, well what did you find?" 'Why,' &s;aid the fir&s;t, 'I found that I had lo&s;t my prize and was out of my latitude.'</P>
<P>"Well that being the ca&s;e," &s;aid his companion, "you &s;ay you can read, tell us what does they cyphers there mean upon that booby hutch in the corner." 'Why its &s;omebody that's buried there,' &s;aid the other.' "Read"! 'Yes, I believe I can, or el&s;e I &s;hould never have been quarter-ma&s;ter.' Stay let me take a little bacco. Now for it: "Sacred, &s;acred", don't you hear? you &s;ee we are in a &s;acred place, Is your hat off? That's right, but come let us go on. "Sacred to the memory", 'Of Who?' "John Hewit!" 'Whew!' "who was &s;hipwrecked on this coa&s;t June 9, 1783.' 'The devil he was! come along me&s;smate.' "Why this is a pretty joke, &s;aid the other, "let us find the captain." So with|out
<PB N="131" REF="132">
further ceremony they went out of the chapel.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation here the reader will ea&s;ily conceive, I &s;oon found I had no cau&s;e of alarm, for this di&s;covery convinc|ed me there mu&s;t be &s;ome Engli&s;h &s;hip upon the coa&s;t, and that I could be in no danger from my own countrymen, e&s;peci|ally with &s;uch a &s;tory as I had to tell. I was re&s;olved however to keep concealed till I had heard every thing; and in pro|portion as this intere&s;ting conver&s;ation between the &s;ailors advanced, &s;o my anxi|ety increa&s;ed, but when I noticed the &s;urprize, and tho&s;e equivocal expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ailors concerning my hu&s;band, I thought my heart would have throbbed through my bo&s;om. Being accu&s;tomed, however, to check every thing like Hope, I &s;till had the fortitude to remain &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations pa&s;&s;ed over, and
<PB N="132" REF="133">
this re&s;olution was taken, as tran&s;ient as a gleam of lightning. I found my whole place taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of and voices i&s;&s;uing from every part. "Where! where!" pre|&s;ently cried one, and then, as &s;everal per|&s;ons entered the chapel, one of them came up to my tomb and read, with great eager|ne&s;s, 'Sacred to the memory of Hannah Hewit,' and was going on, when a voice cried out with great vehemence, "Thou maw dete&s;table gorged with the deare&s;t mor&s;el of the earth;" and then in&s;tantly, in a tone of di&s;traction, another voice ut|tered, 'Oh Heaven have I lived to &s;ee this day!'</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I thought was the voice of Binns, the &s;econd of Walme&s;ley, and the la&s;t I knew to be that of my hu&s;band. I could hold no longer; tearing open the doors of the tomb, and pre&s;enting my&s;elf to their a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ight, I flew to his arms, fell upon his neck, and bur&s;t into tears of
<PB N="133" REF="134">
joy and gratitude, while Walme&s;ley flew about the room like a bedlamite, crying out, 'She lives, &s;he breathes, and we &s;hall &s;till be ble&s;t; our kind propitious &s;tars overpay us now for all our &s;orrows pa&s;t.'</P>
<P>The &s;cene that followed nor tongue, nor pen, nor pencil can de&s;cribe. Surprize, plea&s;ute, anxiety, curio&s;ity, every body felt, but nobody gratified. One affecti|onate enquiry was an&s;wered by another, all was confu&s;ion and incoherence. Binns was delighted, Hewit was entranced, I was &s;ilently putting up a prayer to Hea|ven, and Walme&s;ley, in the language of Shake&s;peare, Rowe, and Otway, was in|voking all the powers that protect virtue, to &s;hower down ble&s;&s;ings on our heads; when, to complete the groupe, entered to my un&s;peakable delight and a&s;toni&s;hment, my brother.</P>
<P>What could I think of all this? I
<PB N="134" REF="135">
knew, my heart knew, by a thou&s;and namele&s;s and con&s;oling plea&s;ures, that I held Hewit in my arms; his heart palpi|tated in uni&s;on with mine; Binns appear|ed the affectionate friendly creature I had ever known him, poor Walme&s;ley, who knew no plea&s;ure but the happine&s;s of his friends, uttered through his memory the delight which his heart dictated; and my brother's manly &s;oul &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed in his eyes, as he beheld his loved his long lo&s;t &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>It was not, however, in the power of our be&s;t re&s;olution for a long time, to give us collection enough to elucidate the cau&s;e of this extraordinary meeting. Their wonder at finding me upon a de&s;o|late i&s;land in the mid&s;t of plenty; my a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing &s;o many friends, &s;ome of whom appeared to have ari&s;en from their graves, collected together; &s;eemed &s;uch a delu&s;ion, that, had we
<PB N="135" REF="136">
been under the power of enchantment, we could not have exhibited a more &s;trik|ing picture of doubtful certainty.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions of how can this be po&s;|&s;ible? by what accident could this hap|pen? what power could have pre&s;erved you? on their &s;ide, and how could you e&s;cape &s;hipwreck? how did you meet to|gether? what chance brought you here? on mine, being uttered almo&s;t all in a breath, each of which required a long and &s;ub&s;tantial an&s;wer; we found, after we had wearied our&s;elves with inquiries, which it would take &s;o much time to re&s;olve, we &s;hould reap very little &s;atisfaction till our prudence had got the better of our won|der.</P>
<P>Certain, therefore, of the fact, thankful to Providence for it, convinced that this was the Heavenly reward for my &s;uffer|ings, &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly promi&s;ed me; I pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="136" REF="137">
that we &s;hould for a &s;hort time wave all curio&s;ity; and, in&s;tead of enquiring how we had become happy, thank that Being in who&s;e pre&s;ence we &s;tood, and who had deigned to witne&s;s our union, that through his gracious goodne&s;s, we had thus miraculou&s;ly met together.</P>
<P>In this propo&s;al every one willingly joined. Hewit cla&s;ped me to his heart, my brother &s;aid I was &s;till his angel of a &s;i&s;ter, Binns lifted his eyes to Heaven, Walme&s;ley vociferated, 'then there are gods, and virtue is their care', and the poor &s;ailors &s;aid they did not mind praying for a week together, if they had &s;uch a chaplain; and after this, &s;o &s;weet a calm came acro&s;s our minds, that we were in a &s;tate deliberately to di&s;cu&s;s the particulars of all our fortunes.</P>
<P>They agreed very willingly that my anxiety &s;hould be gratified fir&s;t; and as, of
<PB N="137" REF="138">
cour&s;e, the adventures of my hu&s;band were of the greate&s;t moment to me, I was very eager to hear them, we therefore adjourn|ed from the chapel into the &s;aloon, where after we had taken &s;ome refre&s;hment and had exchanged &s;uch general intelligence, as that I had been ca&s;t away in the Gro&s;venor, and e&s;caped in an extraordi|nary manner to that i&s;land, where I had not &s;een a human creature alive for more than three years, and that they had met together in India, were now bound in a Dane to Europe, and had, by accident, put in there for water, Hewit was pre|paring to gratify my curio&s;ity, when my brother, who had been whi&s;pering Binns, &s;aid, 'that as there was nothing in Hewit's adventures he was a &s;tranger to, he had better go aboard and &s;ee how matters were going on there.'</P>
<P>Binns took the &s;ailors with him, and

I was left with my brother, Walme&s;ley, and Hewit; who now, at my earne&s;t de|&s;ire, proceeded to relate a long train of adventures, having, in an&s;wer to my anxious enquiry, fir&s;t &s;atisfied me that my &s;on was alive and in perfect health.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II. HEWIT'S STORY.</HEAD>
<P>MY brother a&s;ked me if I had any &s;uch thing as a pipe, and being an&s;wered in the negative, &s;aid, no matter he had a &s;agar in his pocket; which having lighted, and made a bowl of arrack punch, he told Hewit to leave off fondling and begin, de|&s;iring Walme&s;ley to pay attention, who an&s;wered, that he could &s;it all night to hear good coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Hewit, who knew exactly how much
<PB N="140" REF="141">
I had learnt from my brother, &s;aid, 'My dear Hannah will recollect in what di&s;|traction of mind I wrote that letter to cap|tain Higgins, in which I mentioned that I was fully convinced of her innocence through the information of her wretched brother; who, unnatural as he had been certainly, as his end approached, appeared de&s;irous of attoning for the mi&s;ery he had brought upon a &s;i&s;ter who had no fault but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that honour to which he had ever been a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>'But,' &s;aid he, 'let us not dwell on that; whatever might be his crimes, they were expiated by the forfeiture of his life.' "They were", &s;aid Walm&s;ley, I &s;aw him die. No action of his life became him like the leaving it."</P>
<P>'It was through him,' continued Hewit, 'that Sourby had, by means of Mrs. Vint, found out the circum&s;tance of your being &s;ituated in a lodging near town;
<PB N="141" REF="142">
and if he had not been taken up, &s;ome dia|bolical &s;cheme would certainly have been &s;et on foot again&s;t your honour.</P>
<P>'Having, however, enough to turn his thoughts to, he, of cour&s;e, de&s;i&s;ted; and as that good lady could not, or would not, inform him exactly where you were, be|cau&s;e, not to mince the matter, &s;he was de|termined only to a&s;&s;i&s;t his de&s;igns again&s;t you in proportion, as &s;he &s;ucceeded in her de&s;igns again&s;t me, he never was particularly acquainted with your re&s;i|dence, and, therefore, you may be a&s;&s;ured I was not.</P>
<P>'If I could have put on the character of Sourby, I might, perhaps, have made an in&s;trument of Mrs. Vint to have di&s;|covered you; but as my return to her ful|&s;ome love was invective and contemptu|ou&s;ne&s;s, I gained nothing by this half intel|ligence; and it is probable, that till this
<PB N="142" REF="143">
moment I &s;hould have been utterly in the dark concerning you, had not the &s;trange&s;t accident in the world conducted me, but not till it was too late, to your lodgings.</P>
<P>'Being perpetually upon the look out near town, in hopes that &s;ome fortunate accident might guide me to you, I fell in at Strombolo Gardens, near Chel&s;ea, with a &s;urgeon of the name of Greenhead, who &s;ailed aboard your brother. He went after|wards as &s;urgeon to a man of war, and had now a family, and was &s;ettled very reputa|bly at Chel&s;ea,</P>
<P>'This gentleman knew me only by the name of Walme&s;ley; and in con&s;equence of the regard he had for your brother, and the many gales we had weathered together, he received me very cordially.' I knew him, &s;aid I, he is as good a creature as ever exi&s;ted. 'I will convince you in
<PB N="143" REF="144">
a minute,' &s;aid Hewit, 'that we mean the &s;ame man.</P>
<P>'I called on him one day, and find|ing him in his &s;tudy, where he had a kind of mu&s;eum, I noticed in a frame the figure of a coffin lid. I began to joke the doctor and allude to the &s;ervant, who under&s;tand|ing con&s;equences upon being &s;ent for the apothecary brought the &s;urgeon, the phy&s;i|cian, the par&s;on, and the the undertaker.'</P>
<P>"If you knew the &s;tory of that bu&s;i|ne&s;s," &s;aid he, "you would not je&s;t. I would not take an hundred guineas for it. The lady it concerns is now on her way to India, the device was done by her pen|cil, and the in&s;cription is in her own hand writing. She drew and wrote it as a pat|tern for the undertaker to make a coffin plate, who buried her child."</P>
<P>'And my child, &s;aid I, as I approached it and &s;aw a cypre&s;s near an urn, on which
<PB N="144" REF="145">
there was an in&s;cription in your own hand writing, let me read it!</P>
<Q>HANNAH,<LB>the daughter of John and Hannah Hewit,<LB>was born,<LB>Augu&s;t 4, 1776,<LB>and died<LB>December 26, 1780.</Q>
<P>"Why you are mad," &s;aid my friend, "your child!" 'My child, an&s;wered I di&s;tractedly, I murdered it. I broke her heart by my infamous &s;u&s;picions, who was as immaculate as innocence; drove her to penury and want, and then this in|offen&s;ive little one, the victim of my folly, became a prey to poverty and di&s;ea&s;e.'</P>
<P>"No, no," &s;aid Greenhead, "that never would have been the ca&s;e while it had a mother who was one of the mo&s;t in|genius and indu&s;trious woman that ever exi&s;ted." 'Add, &s;aid I, the mo&s;t ami|able, and the mo&s;t wronged.' "I am afraid &s;o," an&s;wered he, "for though
<PB N="145" REF="146">
her delicacy and prudence prevented her from complaining, it was evident &s;he had a hu&s;band who little de&s;erved &s;o much virtue and goodne&s;s. But, Mr. Walme&s;ley, &s;aid he, I had no idea, when I took you by the hand as an old friend, who I had known to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the manly honour of a true tar, that I &s;hould be obliged to upbraid you with having, under the feigned name of Hewit, betrayed and abandoned a wo|man that would have done honour to the fir&s;t abilities and the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>'I told him his reproach did him credit and me ju&s;tice. I accu&s;ed my&s;elf of the mo&s;t egregious folly and ra&s;hne&s;s, but a&s;|&s;ured him, that if he would have the pati|ence to li&s;ten to me, he would find there was nothing villainous nor di&s;honourable in what I had done. I then entered into every thing, told him my real name was Hewit, and my feigned name Walme&s;ley; acquainted with my rea&s;ons for my con|duct
<PB N="146" REF="147">
in that bu&s;ine&s;s, and this brought out to his a&s;toni&s;hment that you were the &s;i&s;ter of captain Higgins. In &s;hort I concealed nothing from him, not even my being un|deceived by your brother, nor my adver|ti&s;ements in the new&s;papers, and fini&s;hed by &s;aying that I had been now upon the look out near to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n for your re&s;idence, more than four months, which I &s;hould never, perhaps, have di&s;covered, if it had not been for this extraordinary accident.</P>
<P>'He heartily pitied me, &s;aid it gave him particular plea&s;ure to find him&s;elf &s;o agree|ably undeceived, and promi&s;ed me every friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. He lamented very much that he had not di&s;|covered your being the &s;i&s;ter of captain Higgins, in which ca&s;e, he &s;aid, you &s;hould have been in his own hou&s;e, and he would have acted the part of a brother by you, until he could have given you into the hands of a repentant hu&s;band; but added he, &s;he was &s;o re&s;erved and &s;o cautious,
<PB N="147" REF="148">
that it would have been highly improper and indeed totally u&s;ele&s;s, to have exacted from her more than &s;he was willing to di&s;|clo&s;e; &s;o I cho&s;e to prove my&s;elf a friend by attention and re&s;pect, in&s;tead of being curious about what I had no right to know, and which I was &s;ure, by the pro|priety of her conduct, &s;he had both a de|licate and an honorable motive for con|cealing.</P>
<P>'Greenhead and I that very day paid a vi&s;it to your lodgings, where the good woman of the hou&s;e, under&s;tanding who I was, gave me a very &s;evere lecture, for which I thanked her mo&s;t &s;incerely. She confirmed the intelligence of your being on your way to India, informed me that &s;he her&s;elf had &s;een you aboard, and &s;aid God would ble&s;s and protect you where|ever you went; for that you was a thou|&s;and times better than any hu&s;band de|&s;erved; and as for me, if I was to take
<PB N="148" REF="149">
a hundred years to repent, I could not be good enough to merit &s;uch a wife.</P>
<P>'This good lady conducted us to Mr. Morris's hou&s;e, where I got another &s;cold|ing which I not only bore with patience, but received with gratitude. When they found how infamou&s;ly I had been deceiv|ed, and how proper my intentions were, they gave me every intelligence they could re&s;pecting you; and really, as I had no doubt of finding you with your brother, who you know I had long per&s;uaded you to join, I began to entertain hopes that a few months would again unite us.</P>
<P>'As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on came round, I made an early application to get out to India, but could not &s;ucceed on board any &s;hip bound to Surat. I therefore, was obliged to put up with a birth in the London bound to Madras, where I &s;afely arrived the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1782.' "Then &s;aid I, you arrived &s;afely in the London, at
<PB N="149" REF="150">
Madras, on the very day I was &s;hip|wrecked in the Gro&s;venor, on the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P>'My &s;weet Hannah,' &s;aid Hewit, 'what thou ha&s;t endured! would I could have added it to the &s;evere hard&s;hips which have been my lot &s;ince that day. But if a life of love and repentance&mdash;' "Ava&s;t, ava&s;t," &s;aid my brother, "keep your love and repentance till you get alone. I &s;up|po&s;e you can let us turn in here, Hannah?" 'Oh yes, &s;aid I, I have plenty of accom|modation for you all;' "and any provi&s;i|ons?" 'Plenty;' "that is enough; Jack go on with your &s;tory, I want to hear her's."</P>
<P>'Well,' continued Hewit, 'from the moment I fet my foot a&s;hore in India, I was unlucky in every thing I undertook. As the mo&s;t rational mode of proceeding, I took a pa&s;&s;age in a coa&s;ter, and in ele|ven weeks arrived at Surat. There, by a
<PB N="150" REF="151">
letter left for me by your brother, with one enclo&s;ed from you, I learnt every thing I wanted to know; and as you con|jured me to return immediately to En|gland, I, long determined never again to do any thing but obey your wi&s;hes, &s;ought for a &s;hip without delay.</P>
<P>'It unluckily happened that the En|gli&s;h &s;hips had all returned, which were bound from the Malabar coa&s;t; and as we were at war with France, at lea&s;t the news of the peace had not reached In|dia, I thought I &s;hould find it difficult to get a pa&s;&s;age in a Frenchman, be|&s;ides, you know I don't much &s;tomach the people.</P>
<P>'It was, however, no time for me to be nice. Week after week pa&s;&s;ed away, and I grew at la&s;t very impatient, till hearing that the Entrepreneur, a French Ea&s;t-In|diaman from Rajahpore to Bordeaux, was ready to &s;ail from the Dutch port of
<PB N="151" REF="152">
Cannonore, I &s;ignified to an old &s;kipper your brother knew, that I &s;hould be glad to work my pa&s;&s;age in her. He, who was a lingui&s;t and knew the trim of the&s;e things, undertook to bring me through the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. I pa&s;&s;ed among the Dutch for a Frenchman, and among the French for a Dutch man; but finding the matter more difficult than I apprehended, I was upon the point of giving it up when an accident mo&s;t unexpectedly brought it about for me.</P>
<P>'I met a lady one day whom I thought I had &s;omewhere &s;een. She &s;topt under the &s;ame idea to look at me.' "Binns in the play-hou&s;e lobby, &s;aid I, but I won't be jealous." 'No, my &s;weet Hannah,' &s;aid he, you have too much good &s;en&s;e to be guilty of any &s;uch egregious &s;olly, for egregious it was, as you will find when you know all.</P>
<P>'Well, we &s;oon knew each other.
<PB N="152" REF="153">
You remember I had the good fortune in Paris, to &s;ave the life of a little boy, whom I &s;natched from under the wheels of a coach, which, a moment later, would have gone over him. His danger was fir&s;t an|nounced by the &s;creams of his &s;i&s;ter. Mad|moi&s;elle Dupont, &s;aid I, I have thought of it an hundred times, as one of the many providental circum&s;tances that have come to my knowledge.' "Well, it was Mad|moi&s;elle Dupont you met; I recollect &s;he went to India." 'She did,' &s;aid Hewit,' 'not after an unkind, unworthy hu&s;band as you did, but to find a kind and a worthy one, his name was D'Oliviere.</P>
<P>"D'Oliviere, &s;aid I, gracious Heaven! Then ri&s;ing and opening the door that led to the chapel, do you &s;ee that altar, tho&s;e &s;kulls? They are the &s;kulls of that wretch|ed couple." 'The ways of Heaven,' &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'are dark and intricate, puzzled with mazes, and perplexed with er|rors.' "Why where are we got?" &s;aid my
<PB N="153" REF="154">
brother, "one would think this was Lapland, and that we were among the witches!" 'Well, but,' &s;aid Hewit, in a&s;toni&s;hment, 'if this is the ca&s;e&mdash;' "Be calm, &s;aid I, and go on with your &s;tory, I &s;hall a&s;toni&s;h you more before I have done."</P>
<P>'Well,' &s;aid Hewit, 'this lady intro|duced me to her hu&s;band; who learning the nature of her obligations to me, though only a pa&s;&s;enger him&s;elf, and of cour&s;e without power aboard, &s;aid he had no doubt but he could prevail upon the cap|tain to take me. This he did; I was to work my pa&s;&s;age, and this good lady and gentle|man promi&s;ed to &s;hew me every attention in their power, which promi&s;e they faith|fully kept.</P>
<P>'And now began my troubles with a witne&s;s. We had not two days in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion that we could call good weather,
<PB N="154" REF="155">
for almo&s;t four months. We were for ever &s;cudding ju&s;t as the wind thought proper to kick us. At la&s;t, in the toughe&s;t gale I ever &s;aw, or, I hope, ever &s;hall, we got bump a&s;hore&mdash;'</P>
<P>"Between tho&s;e rocks, &s;aid I." 'Here!' &s;aid Hewit, 'why what a fine reckoning we kept then! To be &s;ure we had not &s;een fun, nor moon, nor hardly one another, for &s;ix or eight days. We all thought we were near the Cape. Oh it was mo&s;t &s;hocking work! I fired the fir&s;t &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s.' "You did, &s;aid I, you noted it in your &s;ignal book, and wi&s;hed that I might be praying for you when at that very moment I was on my knees invoking every power to ble&s;s and protect you."</P>
<P>'Divine creature! &s;aid Hewit, 'is it po&s;&s;ible I could be &s;o near happine&s;s, and yet deprived of every ble&s;&s;ing? But I had not &s;uffered enough, my crime was not &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed. Well, after
<PB N="155" REF="156">
firing three or four times more, our &s;ig|nals were an&s;wered by a blaze of light from the &s;hore,' "which proceeded from a pile of wood that I had &s;et fire to, &s;aid I, I felt, I almo&s;t knew you were there, and my love for my hu&s;band in&s;pired the thought. Go on."</P>
<P>'Finding,' continued Hewit, 'that at every &s;ignal the flame increa&s;ed, we agreed to lay by till day-light and then venture a&s;hore in our boats. In the fir&s;t that was hoi&s;ted out I got a place. It was then &s;carcely day and with all our &s;kill we could not make the &s;hore; but, being by the &s;urge driven round the point of a rock, we pre&s;ently found our&s;elves out at &s;ea.</P>
<P>'There were nineteen in the boat, &s;even of whom including my&s;elf, after beating about at the mercy of the elements for &s;ix days, without any provi&s;ion but which had been &s;natched up at the moment of leav|ing the &s;hip, were taken up by the Adven|ture,

'I did, &s;aid I.' "Well," &s;aid he, "you &s;hall tell us all about it.

'Well,' &s;aid I, let Hewit fini&s;h his &s;tory and then I'll convince you, however wonderful appearances may &s;eem, under the guidance of Providence that has graci|ou&s;ly protected me, every thing here has been created by the &s;ugge&s;tions of my fancy, and the labour of my hands.'

<P>'The adventure as I told you," &s;aid Hewit, was bound on a voyage of di&s;cove|ries. Her orders were to get if po&s;&s;ible eigh|teen degrees beyond the antartic circle. It &s;eems that &s;ome notable di&s;coverer had proved in a long treati&s;e, to the &s;atisfac|tion of the Royal Society, that there was certainly an untouched continent in the South Sea; which when it &s;hould be once taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, would make all tho&s;e in numerable i&s;lands tributary to it,
<PB N="159" REF="160">
ju&s;t as almo&s;t imperceptible gobules of quick&s;ilver, are &s;wept into one large body. So to find this continent in nubi|bus they &s;ailed; and, that they might do the thing in a &s;eamanlike manner, they &s;tood away from England for the Azores, and thence directly acro&s;s the Atlantic to Davis's Straits, upon this principle; that, as Columbus in looking for the Ea&s;t In|dies found out the We&s;t, &s;o by keeping to the North they &s;hould have the whole South before them; or, &s;aid I, as dogs get to that hedge oppo&s;ite to the weather, that they may better &s;nuff up the air of the whole field.</P>
<P>'Our captain lent me the whole trea|ti&s;e, and to be &s;ure it contained &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious rea&s;oning that ever enter|ed the imagination of a bedlamite; and all to prove that this continent was ea&s;ily di&s;|coverable. I mu&s;t give you one in&s;tance of it.</P>

'All the world knows &s;ays this rea|&s;oner, thanks to Sir I&s;aac Newton, that the world is not exactly &s;pherical; but I &s;hall hazard a much &s;tronger opinion, which if it prove truth, may, perhaps, take in not only the various errors in relation to the longitude, but all errors and variations of every de&s;cription, and &s;hew the origin of winds, tides, currents, vortexes, and every other &s;pecies of natural phenomenae, to be matters as &s;elf evident as day|light.</P>
<P>'My conjecture is this. The globe is not only flatted at the poles but regularly all over, like a circular building in cants, making 129,600 &s;quare degrees. Thus the French philo&s;ophers mea&s;ured a &s;hort de|gree towards the pole, and a long one at the equator, not, however, becau&s;e there is any real difference between two given de|grees, but becau&s;e, I beg I may be attend|ed to, they hit at one place upon the two

oppo&s;ite points of a quadrangle, and at the other they mea&s;ured from parallel to parallel, which is al&s;o the boundary of the &s;quare. So that Sir I&s;aac Newton, this admitted, triumphed by accident; for, had the angular mea&s;urement been taken at the pole and the parallel at the equator, Ca&s;&s;ini would have reaped an honour which chance, at which, out of love to my dear country, I rejoice, conferred on our immortal Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>'Thus like the &s;piculae in the circula|tion of mercury, which are as it were &s;o many weapons that enable the quick&s;ilver to fight with its natural enemy the di&s;ea&s;e, are the points of the&s;e angles a well ima|gined defence to combat with winds, me|teors, and other elementary foes; and I &s;hould hope no one will be ab&s;urd enough to contradict &s;o rea&s;onable a doctrine, &s;ince every creature has its means of de|fence from a gnat to a rhinorceros, and a

<P>'Be&s;ides I &s;hall go further. The moon is unque&s;tionably armed in the &s;ame manner, and what is called her horns are no other than tho&s;e very angles. The poets indeed, by this expre&s;&s;ion have taken leave to &s;ay, that the earth and the moon are a lantern to each other, but they have mi&s;taken the truth; they are a mirror to each other, or rather a multi|tude of &s;quare mirrors regularly framed; otherwi&s;e how could they convey &s;o &s;trong a light by reflection? a diamond emits the be&s;t reflected brilliancy of any object known to us, but even that gem gives it not in perfection, till it has been in the hands of the lapidary; therefore, without any great &s;tretch of probability, it is not

'They were glad enough to get us aboard, being rather barren of hands; three of the crew having died of the &s;curvy, one having been knocked out the boat by the tail of a grampus, four left upon a de&s;olate i&s;land, becau&s;e they ex|cited a mutiny, and two poor devils hav|ing been killed and eaten by &s;avages.</P>

<P>'We penetrated as far as we could &s;outhward, and landed at &s;everal places, which were certainly i&s;lands, or pieces of floating ice. At la&s;t, being very &s;hort of provi&s;ions, and eaten up with the &s;curvy, we were obliged to return as wi&s;e as we went; and having in our way back bought feathers, frogs, and flying cats, which we paid for with tenpenny nails, and having, be&s;ides, collected a prodigious number of humming birds, &s;hells, &s;nakes eggs, fi&s;h down, crocodiles' teeth; crabs' eyes, together with two and twenty cla&s;&s;es

of animalculae, and numberle&s;s other ar|ticles, after being out a year and a half, all which time we were never within &s;ixty degrees of the line, we arrived in a mo&s;t crazy condition at Manilla.</P>
<P>'I was now in the mo&s;t curious place I had ever touch at in my life, for the peo|ple being of all nations and per&s;ua&s;ions, revile, trick, and laugh at one another. the Chine&s;e cheat the Malays, the Malays the Ethiopians, the Pintendos rob the Por|tuge&s;e, while all join together to elude the vigilence of the Spaniards, who, in their turn, laugh at the Engli&s;h for &s;uffering them to &s;it down quietly in their govern|ment, though they never paid more than half their ran&s;om.</P>

<P>'The&s;e Je&s;uits having confi&s;cated &s;ome religious trea&s;ure, had determined to tran&s;port them&s;elves from France, to avoid the fury of the government. The government, however, was too cunning for them; for, getting &s;cent of their fraud and not wi&s;hing to brand them publickly in France, on account of the veil they think it politic to throw over the pecula|tions of prie&s;ts, the captain of the ve&s;&s;el which the Je&s;uits had hired, received a private order from the general of the po|lice, to deprive them of their ill gotten wealth when they &s;hould arrive in a cer|tain latitude, to fix a mark of infamy upon their &s;houlders, and then leave them a&s;hore on the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>

'When they came to the place where this &s;cene was to be acted, one of the Je|&s;uits, having overheard a conver&s;ation be|tween the captain and his chief mate, &s;aw into the whole bu&s;ine&s;s; upon which a private coun&s;el was held among the Je|&s;uits, and a motion was carried to throw the captain and the mate overboard, and &s;eize the &s;hip. This was executed almo&s;t as &s;oon as re&s;olved. The captain, the mate, and two or three others, were hu&s;tled into the &s;ea, and the re&s;t expediti|ou&s;ly battened down below, where they were told their treatment would depend upon their conduct.</P>
<P>'After a long parly, it was agreed that the &s;ailors &s;hould be at liberty to trade upon their own bottoms as pirates, the Je&s;uits only de&s;iring to be landed &s;afely with their property at China, and it was in their way there they had met with and captured us. We had now our choice
<PB N="169" REF="170">
either to turn pirates and crui&s;e in com|pany, or to be &s;et a&s;hore on the fir&s;t de&s;o|late i&s;land, to become a prey to wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>'Two of the French men were yet alive who had been &s;aved out of the En|trepreneur. The&s;e begged they might accompany the Je&s;uits, and join in their laudable plan of converting the inhabi|tants of China to the true faith. This being agreed to, they were decorated with a mock ton&s;or, and enveloped in a piece of old black baize. In this &s;ituation they took an oath to adhere to the intere&s;ts of the fraternity and to keep its &s;ecrets, which the Je&s;uits &s;wore was the only ce|remony of induction they had ever gone through.</P>
<P>'As to the captain, my&s;elf and the re&s;t of the crew, by way of choo&s;ing the lea&s;t of two evils, we agreed to join the

pirates and thus every body being &s;atis|fied, we proceeded towards China with a fair wind.</P>
<P>'Being now all rogues alike, it was agreed that every man &s;hould relate his adventures. The &s;ailors had very little more to &s;ay than that they had made a number of voyages, the profits of which they had &s;pent as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after their arrival in port; and that they had been perpetually the dupes of pro&s;titutes and fal&s;e friends, none of whom would acknowledge them whenever they came home in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>'As for the Je&s;uits their lives were curious enough. If it won't tire you I will repeat &s;ome of the particulars. I begged he would. One of them &s;aid he was the left-hand &s;on of one nobleman, and had been page to another, from who&s;e family he was driven out for theft. After this, rather than &s;tarve, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf
<PB N="171" REF="172">
with picking pockets in the churches while he was kneeling for a benediction; but being detected one day by a prie&s;t who had &s;tood in admiration of his dexterity, he had got him admitted as porter to a convent of Carthu&s;ian monks; and having qualified him&s;elf in every re&s;pect for trading upon his own foundation, he was admitted into the brotherhood; where he had procured as much wealth to be left to the church, that is to &s;ay to him and his fraternity, as had occa&s;ioned the ruin of forty individuals; he had ab&s;olved &s;everal &s;inners of &s;acrilege, upon condition they gave him back their plunder, he had had thirteen children, though he had taken the vow of celibacy whom he had bred up, the boys being eight in number, till they were of a proper age to &s;end as a venture to the new world, and made the girls nuns in a certain convent, where he had connived at the de&s;truction of their virtue, to enrich him&s;elf with the contributions of their &s;educers.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">
'He &s;aid in the commi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e and innumerable other pranks equally at|trocious, he had taken care to lead a life of the mo&s;t edifying &s;anctity; till the re|putation of his &s;uperior cunning had at|tracted the notice of the Je&s;uits, who had invited him to become a member of their order, in which &s;ituation he had acted to their advantage and his own.</P>
<P>'A &s;econd &s;aid, that having been a cap|tain of dragoons, and killed a man in a duel, he had fled to the church for &s;anctuary; where being admitted till the matter could be hu&s;hed up, he liked the conver&s;ation of the prie&s;ts &s;o well, that under a pretence of &s;orrow for having committed murder, he had prevailed upon them to admit him a member of their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>'He &s;aid he had been guilty, with very little variation, of all the crimes re|lated by his holy brother; but having a forwarder, and more open degree of im|pudence
<PB N="173" REF="174">
than his companions, one of whom took upon him to be very lavi&s;h of his ad|monitions, he was determined to be re|venged; when finding his &s;anctified pre|ceptor rather too familiar with a certain abbe&s;s, of who&s;e favours he him&s;elf had been a partaker, he took the liberty of chucking the gentleman out of the win|dow, which was &s;o re&s;ented by the order, that the con&s;equence would have been fatal to him&s;elf but for the abbe&s;s, who would not give him up.</P>
<P>'This &s;pirited conduct of the lady, added he, who they knew if they accu&s;ed would recriminate, brought about a par|ley: when it was agreed that under a new appelation I &s;hould take the en&s;igns of an|other order, and that they would give out that I had been put to death in private for the murder of the friar, by a particular in|qui&s;itorial mandate, which they actually obtained for that purpo&s;e. The Je&s;uits, he &s;aid, had received him among&s;t them,
<PB N="174" REF="175">
and what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince was not un|known to the company.</P>
<P>'A third &s;aid, he could prove his lineal de&s;cent from the very prie&s;t who had the immortal honour, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, execration, of propo&s;ing the fir&s;t expedi|tion to the Holy Land. His own birth was, indeed, rather ob&s;cure, being &s;on to a man who got his bread by making cru|cifixes, and painting flames upon the black baize, u&s;ed at every <HI>auta de fe.</HI></P>
<P>'He &s;aid, that being twelve years old, he was made a &s;ort of runner to a pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition; where, being ob&s;erved to have a particular ta&s;te for augmenting the mi&s;ery of the victims, he was early pro|moted to be one of the torturers, in which religious practice he would be bold to &s;ay, he had introduced more ingenious refine|ments than one would think the wit of man could invent, or the heart permit him to exerci&s;e; and all this, he &s;aid, he found
<PB N="175" REF="176">
the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, people under the influence of that holy court, were tor|tured to confe&s;s &s;ins they had never com|mitted. The Je&s;uits, however, he &s;aid cajoled him from this &s;ituation, though &s;o extremely plea&s;ant and comfortable, well knowing that a man &s;o brought up would be a con&s;iderable acqui&s;ition to their com|munity.</P>
<P>'A fourth &s;aid, he had been a Jew; but, having ridiculed &s;ome of the ceremo|nies of that religion, and in particular their ab&s;tinence from pork, he had been anathe|matized, and his hair, toe nails, &s;pine, mar|row, kidneys, midriff, brains, arteries, &s;kin, lungs, teeth, bowels, mu&s;cles, head, heels, and every other part about him, &s;olemnly and formally damned to all eternity.</P>
<P>'Thus de&s;erted by his own religion, he thought he could not do better than place him&s;elf under the protection of &s;ome other. He, therefore, turned mahometan, and was &s;oon after the principal projector of the
<PB N="176" REF="177">
large&s;t fire that ever happened among the Jewi&s;h inhabitants of Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>'At this fire, he &s;aid, he got pretty warm; but fearing he &s;hould be found out as the ringleader of the mi&s;chief, he took the earlie&s;t opportunity of leaving that part of the world. The riches, how|ever, that he had &s;aved out of the fire, went as merily as they came; for falling in with a rover, he was carried into Algiers and &s;old for a &s;lave. He, however, con|trived, in conjunction with two Roman Catholic prie&s;ts to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection; and having murdered their ma&s;ter and his family, and &s;eized one of his &s;hips, they relea&s;ed the crews of two galleys, and finally arrived at a Spani&s;h in port &s;afety.</P>
<P>'Here he &s;aid, being received within the pale of the church of Rome, he was &s;oon after admitted among the Je&s;uits, of who&s;e holy body he hoped he had not proved an unworthy member.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">
'A fifth had been one of the people called Quakers; but having been detected in a fal&s;ity upon an affirmation, he had been as thoroughly excommunicated, though not &s;o violently as the Jew.</P>
<P>'Knowing it would be to no purpo&s;e to &s;eek a reconciliation with the faithful, he turned Methodi&s;t; in which &s;ituation he had &s;ent &s;even old women to bedlam, induced one mi&s;erable &s;inner to poi&s;on him&s;elf that he might have a freer com|munication with his wife, and made &s;e|veral others become bankrupts to the ruin of their families.</P>
<P>'He was whipt and tran&s;ported from England, branded in Holland, puni&s;hed with the &s;ingle knout in Ru&s;&s;ia, and bani&s;h|ed to the copper mines in Siberia, whence he e&s;caped in company with eight other &s;laves, namely, a philo&s;opher, a bigot, a prie&s;t, a Jew, a French trooper, an Italian
<PB N="178" REF="179">
&s;inger, a Portuge&s;e bravo, and an Engli&s;h traveller; the latter of whom, when their di&s;tre&s;&s;es became intollerable, politely hung him&s;elf that they might eat him.</P>
<P>'Having travelled, he &s;aid, through a prodigious tract of country, during which time they &s;uffered innumerable hard&s;hips, they arrived at Ea&s;tern Tartary, where, by the prie&s;t's advice, they converted a hord of &s;avages, and afterwards plundered them to procure the means of their e&s;cape into Europe; where, after a time, having ar|rived in &s;afety, his friend, the prie&s;t, had procured him admi&s;&s;ion into the commu|nity of the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>'Having given you, &s;aid Hewet, this &s;ample of the&s;e holy hypocrites, you will not wonder that the captain of the Ad|venture and I formed a &s;cheme to get out of their clutches. The pirates had at fir&s;t put one of their own people to command our &s;hip, and di&s;tributed our crew among
<PB N="179" REF="180">
their own, but after a time they did not think this precaution nece&s;&s;ary; for, finding that we met them half way in every thing, and that we were more anxious for plun|der when we fell in with a prize than they, all which conduct was put on, as a point of honour and a proof of their confidence, they rein&s;tated the captain in his com|mand and gave the crew preci&s;ely their former &s;ituations.</P>
<P>'The pirates had formed a de&s;ign to rob the Je&s;uits before they &s;hould come to port, in which de&s;ign we pretended to agree, and the Je&s;uits, on their part, had concerted a plan to give up the pirates to ju&s;tice, and make the &s;hip and cargo their own. How they managed, however, I neither know nor care. As &s;oon as an opportunity offered we gave them the &s;lip in the night, exactly as Walme&s;ley and I had tricked the attorney and the butcher, and in about a month afterwards, now four

<P>"With them I embarked in a Dane for Europe; and being for once in my life under the power of a guardian angel, my puni&s;hments are pa&s;t, and I am at la&s;t, in your arms, rewarded for my con&s;tancy and per&s;everance.

<HEAD>CHAP IV. HANNAH'S STORY.</HEAD>
<P>HEWIT having fini&s;hed his &s;tory, I was very &s;olicitous to hear what had happened to the re&s;t, and particularly to Binns, the my&s;tery of who&s;e long ab&s;ence and va|rious adventures, which, of cour&s;e, they could unravel, excited in me the highe&s;t curio&s;ity. My brother, however, in&s;i&s;ted upon having every thing in order, nor could I even prevail on them to tell me how Walme&s;ley came alive, who, as we had been over and over again informed, died in Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
My brother &s;aid that Binns would relate his own &s;tory, which I &s;hould find intere&s;ting enough; and as to Walme&s;ley, he &s;hould give us his the next morning at Breakfa&s;t, for that there would hardly be time enough to hear mine that night, and he was determined not to turn in till he had learnt every particular.</P>
<P>Finding I had nothing el&s;e for it, I did as he de&s;ired me, taking up my &s;tory from the time I &s;ailed in the Gro&s;venor, every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed before, being, of cour&s;e known to them through him, from whom I had concealed no part of my adventures. The dreadful hard&s;hips I had with my poor companions &s;u&s;tained on the coa&s;t of Africa, excited the tender|e&s;t intere&s;t in the brea&s;t of Hewit and my brother; and as to poor Walme&s;ley, he was every now and then &s;talking about and uttering, "By day and night but this is wonderous &s;trange," or &s;ome other quotation from a play.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185">
But when I came to &s;peak of Sourby and his carrying me off, I thought poor Hewit would have fallen from his &s;eat.' "Oh the villain," &s;aid he, "born to thwart my happine&s;s in every part of the world! Tell me, my dear Hannah&mdash;" Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, &s;aid I, my honour was pre|&s;erved by M'Daniel the carpenter's mate, who you knew brother.</P>
<P>"I did know him," &s;aid my brother, "he was always a good lad&mdash;What is be|come of him?" 'He landed with me, &s;aid I, on this i&s;land, but he did not &s;urvive an hour; he had received his death blow from Sourby.' "What an infernal vil|lain!" &s;aid my brother. "Well, all the poor lad wi&s;hed was to provide for his aged mother; I know where to find her, and I'll take care, for his &s;ake, &s;he &s;hall never want."</P>
<P>'But what became of Sourby?' &s;aid my hu&s;band, ha&s;tily. "Are there no
<PB N="185" REF="186">
bolts in Heaven?" &s;aid Walme&s;ley. 'Do tell me,' &s;aid my brother, 'that the hor|rible &s;coundrel was bla&s;ted by a fla&s;h of lightning, or that the devil fetched him away alive, or &s;ome thing or other, to ea&s;e my curio&s;ity.' "He was &s;wallowed in my pre&s;ence, &s;aid I, by a &s;hark."</P>
<P>'That's right! that's right!' &s;aid my brother. "Gracious, ju&s;t, and merciful God," &s;aid Hewit, "thy hand was there." 'Well,' but &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'that &s;hark was a cannibal;' 'Owing I &s;uppo&s;e,' &s;aid my brother, 'to his being bred up upon the coa&s;t of Africa. He mu&s;t have had a delicious meal; it would have given me plea&s;ure to have minced it for him, a little beforehand.'</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid I, but if you inter|rupt me in this manner, I &s;hall never get to the end of my &s;tory, and you will plea&s;e to recollect I am anxious to hear

yours. "I beg your pardon," &s;aid my bro|ther, "it is your fault Jack, you are &s;o cur&s;edly impatient&mdash;go on Hannah;" then taking up the bowl, "Here's may the devil be merciful to him, and that's more than he de&s;erves."</P>
<P>I now methodized all I had already told them, and then went regularly on with what I had further to &s;ay. They commi&s;erated the fate of poor M'Daniel, wondered at my a&s;toni&s;hing per&s;everence, could &s;carcely conceive how I had kept my &s;en&s;es in the mid&s;t of &s;o many and &s;uch extraordinary trials, admired the &s;e|cundity of my genius in which I had found &s;o many various and comfortable re&s;ources, all which they could &s;carcely have credited, had they not well known my abilities, and the wonderful fortitude with which Heaven had endowed me.</P>
<P>The whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;hipwreck, and the ingenious means by which I had
<PB N="187" REF="188">
&s;upplied my&s;elf with whatever I wanted, were next &s;ubjects of their admiration. After this I came to my wonderful e&s;cape from the lione&s;s, my return to the cavern, the particulars of tho&s;e documents I had found in Hewit's che&s;t, my dome&s;ticating the young lion, which almo&s;t excited in Hewit another fit of jealou&s;ly, for I told him I had had a companion who&s;e worth and fidelity I &s;hould ever regret; that he had watched me, valued me, and loved me; that he was my con&s;tant companion, my faithful friend, and my generous pro|tector; that at la&s;t he lo&s;t his life in de|fence of my honour, and, that no tears were ever more poignant or more &s;incere, than tho&s;e I had &s;hed at his death.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered generou&s;ly to this, that he held my honour in &s;o &s;acred a light that he would an&s;wer with his life for the pro|priety of my conduct, whatever it might turn out upon an explanation. I told him

he did me ju&s;tice, and that he would de|plore the lo&s;s of the noble creature I had alluded to, as much as I did.</P>
<P>I then explained my&s;elf, and they were delighted at the circum&s;tance, which I was charmed to find they did not con&s;i|der as any thing extraordinary. My bro|ther &s;aid that a la&s;car u&s;ed to traver&s;e the wilds of Arabia, as a me&s;&s;enger from the different armies with no other guide or protector than a lion, from who&s;e carca&s;e he had plucked a poi&s;oned arrow, and by &s;ucking the wound had cured it; and he might &s;till, &s;aid he, have had the generous creature for his guide, but that a certain nabob thought it expedient to hang the la&s;car to prevent his telling tales. Leo, however, revenged him; for, though he came too late to &s;ave his benefactors life, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the populace, he flew at the executioner and tore him to pieces; and, perhaps, he might have done
<PB N="189" REF="190">
the &s;ame by the nabob if he could have got at him, and no harm into the bargain.</P>
<P>Hewit &s;aid that Leo's mother was the mo&s;t harmle&s;s creature that ever was &s;een, for that the officer who had the care of her u&s;ed to play with her like a cat, and as to Walme&s;ley, he &s;aid he would rather tru&s;t a lion than a man at any time; for, &s;aid he, tru&s;t not a man he is by na|ture fal&s;e, di&s;&s;embling, fickle, cruel, and ungrateful; but a lion, Oh the gentle mon&s;ter! why I once at a country fair put my head into a lion's mouth out of a bit of fun.</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, &s;aid I, Hewit you mu&s;t forgive me if I think of Leo as long as I live with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s. He was my faithful friend, my kind compa|nion, my willing a&s;&s;i&s;tant. He was &s;ent me by providence to le&s;&s;en my labours, to alleviate my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to pre&s;erve my honour, to be my generous guardian, my

valiant &s;afeguard, my noble champion, till Heaven &s;hould re&s;tore my natural protector.</P>
<P>'Laud we the gods,' &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'and let our crooked &s;moke climb to their no&s;trils!' "Be quiet, you Walme&s;ley," &s;aid my brother, "and let her go on; and, you Hewit, who had tenderly caught me in his arms, and &s;wore that it &s;hould be the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of his life to love and oblige me. Can't you have done with your raptures? come, Hannah, let us hear a little more, poor Leo! Well, next to a &s;hark, I &s;hall in future like a lion.'</P>
<P>'Having by their interruptions, ob|liged me to tell my &s;tory in this disjointed way, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of recapi|tulating many circum&s;tances over and over again. My brother, in particular, made me dwell upon the expedients I had u&s;ed, and the methods I had pur&s;ued to erect, decorate, and furni&s;h &s;uch a building,
<PB N="191" REF="192">
which I explained to him &s;o &s;atisfactorily, that he wondered no longer at any thing but my courage and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed all I had to &s;ay in the be&s;t manner that I could with &s;o many interruptions, we began to think of &s;upper; and while I was be&s;tirring my&s;elf for that purpo&s;e, Hewit, my brother, and Walme&s;ley, paid a vi&s;it to every part of my man&s;ion. As I was cooking I could not avoid hearing their remarks. The cabin is convenient, &s;aid Walme&s;ley, there you are Jack, &s;aid my brother, razors to grind! &s;ci&s;&s;ars to grind! how the jade loves you; well, though &s;he is my &s;i&s;ter, I dont think her equal is to be met with upon the face of the earth.</P>
<P>Her equal, &s;aid Hewit, &s;ee in future whether all the treachery of hell, &s;hall make a fool of me again! See with what pains &s;he has traced her various fortunes with her pencil, all marked with &s;ome
<PB N="192" REF="193">
affectionate proof that though I, idiot as I was, had for&s;aken her, &s;he had nobly forgiven the wrong and &s;till loved the un|worthy author of her &s;ufferings. But her mind was always &s;uperior to mine, and by all that's ju&s;t &s;he &s;hall implicitly guide me to my la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P>See, &s;ee, &s;aid my brother, here is Wal|me&s;ley at the begging grate of Leice&s;ter goal. "Who calls on Achmet," &s;aid Wal|me&s;ley, you may well &s;ay that, &s;aid my brother, the words are coming out of your mouth.</P>
<P>After the&s;e and other remarks in the &s;aloon, they entered the chapel; where the different in&s;criptions on the urns excited in them the tendere&s;t &s;en&s;a|tions, nor could they read &s;o many tri|butes of e&s;teem to their remembrance, &s;o many grateful acknowledgements of the bounty of Providence, &s;o many mo|ral and religious proofs of pious re&s;ig|nation,
<PB N="193" REF="194">
without being deeply impre&s;&s;ed with admiration, at the &s;acred and holy &s;en&s;e in which I held my duty towards my Creator.</P>
<P>They contemplated the &s;kulls with awful veneration; and, when Hewit took up the bible, I &s;aw him in an agony. The tears wet his manly cheeks, his &s;ighs &s;eemed to rend his very heart, his eyes were lifted to Heaven; till at length in a bur&s;t of fervid admiration, he fell on his knees at the altar, and entreated that the heavie&s;t judgment of Heaven might be &s;howered on his head, if he &s;hould ever again give me cau&s;e to heave a &s;ingle &s;igh.</P>
<P>The tombs were next vi&s;ited. In Hewit's tomb was depo&s;ited the che&s;t which contained all tho&s;e documents I have already mentioned, be&s;ides the hi&s;|tory of my &s;ad life up to the period of
<PB N="194" REF="195">
tho&s;e reflections, ju&s;t before I lo&s;t poor Leo, that induced me to believe my latter end was approaching. The&s;e I had carefully arranged in hopes that time might one day bring them to light, for the information, and I flattered my&s;elf, edification of the world, little expecting I &s;hould have &s;o complete a cata&s;trophe to add to my adventures.</P>
<P>At the end of the in&s;cription on my own tomb, I referred the reader for fur|ther information to the che&s;t that thus there might be no mi&s;take. All this method and regularity they very much admired. They then examined the in&s;ide of my tomb, and were wonderfully &s;truck with all they &s;aw, but particularly the al|legorical allu&s;ions contained in the artifi|cial flowers. There is rue for you, Hewit, &s;aid Walme&s;ley, well then upon my &s;oul this is too much! &s;aid my brother, too much, Sir, &s;aid Walme&s;ley, why thought and affiiction, pa&s;&s;ion, hell
<PB N="195" REF="196">
it&s;elf, &s;he turns to favour and to pret|tine&s;s.</P>
<P>I now &s;ummoned them all to &s;upper, and had the plea&s;ure to receive their com|pliments on my cookery, which, together with all the re&s;t according to them was admirable, we were very comfortable, my brother in particular; who, at la&s;t having drank arrack punch pretty plenti|fully, grew quite facecious. He told Hewit he was a happy ra&s;cal, talked of wedding nights, of making up for lo&s;t time, and other inoffen&s;ive jokes, kindly meant and kindly taken. At la&s;t we pre|vailed on him to go to bed, Walme&s;ley followed his example, and now, after an ab&s;ence of five years, I retired to the arms of my hu&s;band.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. WALMESLEY'S STORY.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I prepared breakfa&s;t next morn|ing, the three friends walked out to exa|mine the beauties around my dwelling, and when they returned, were of cour&s;e very lavi&s;h in the prai&s;es of all they had &s;een. How &s;hould you like to live here? &s;aid I. My brother an&s;wered that for a life a&s;hore he &s;hould like it very well. Walme&s;ley &s;aid it was a paradi&s;e of never ending &s;weets, and Hewit &s;aid any place would be a paradi&s;e with me.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">
Breakfa&s;t being over, I reminded Walme&s;ley that it was now his turn to tell his &s;tory, come, &s;aid I, Mr. Walme&s;ley, don't you think I am impatient to her how you could make &s;uch a blunder as to come here after dying in Ireland? Dying, &s;aid Walme&s;ley, Oh, no, no &s;uch thing, they buried me to be &s;ure, but I was not dead, I took care of that.</P>
<P>Curious enough, certainly it was&mdash;You &s;ee there was a poor pains taking fellow with a wife in a con&s;umption, an old mother, and a &s;ick child; &s;o, becau&s;e he could not pay a debt of thirteen pounds, for no rea&s;on upon earth but that he had not a &s;ingle halfpenny in the world, they took the bed from under the&s;e poor devils, for they had but one among them. Did you ever hear of &s;uch a &s;et of ra&s;cals?</P>
<P>Well thinks I to my&s;elf what's to be done now? Suppo&s;e thou lette&s;t them
<PB N="198" REF="199">
have thy bed? &s;aid good nature. Hold, &s;aid churli&s;hne&s;s, what art thou to do thy&s;elf? manage in the be&s;t manner thou can'&s;t, &s;aid genero&s;ity; charity begins at home, &s;aid prudence; a good deed finds its own reward, &s;aid virtue, if you get &s;ick who is to pay the doctor? &s;aid ill|nature.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, my con&s;cience hanging about the neck of my heart, ladies or gentle|men, &s;aid I, or whatever you are that keep this pother o'er my head, &s;ince you are equal in your opinions upon this &s;ub|ject, if you will permit me I will have a ca&s;ting vote; and as I never valued my|&s;elf nor ever &s;hall, when I could or can oblige any body el&s;e, which by the way is an iri&s;ci&s;m, for the true way of valuing one&s;elf is to oblige any body el&s;e, that vote &s;hall be that the people have the bed.</P>
<P>Who knows but I may be in the &s;ame &s;ituation my&s;elf? I have taken one &s;tep
<PB N="199" REF="200">
towards it already; I am without a bed. I want nothing now but the wife in a con|&s;umption, the old mother, and the &s;ick child.</P>
<P>So I gave them the bed. I lie, I &s;old it to them, they paid me for it by a &s;mile and a tear, valuable enough to have pur|cha&s;ed a whole uphol&s;terer's &s;hop. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that I caught a devil of a cold by lying on the ground, and the apo|thecary advi&s;ed me to have my bed back again, &s;aying, that if I had not he could not an&s;wer for the con&s;equence; "Slave," &s;aid I, "I have &s;et my life upon a ca&s;t, and I will &s;tand the hazard of the die."</P>
<P>The apothecary &s;aid, very truly that he could not an&s;wer for the con&s;equence. My cold introduced an old acquaintance to me called the rheumati&s;m. I cod I had it now hip and thigh. The doctor plied me with phy&s;ic by whole&s;ale; but one
<PB N="200" REF="201">
day, having informed me that he &s;hould &s;end a cordial mixture for me to take, and an embrocation to rub my&s;elf with, he made a blunder, which was natural enough, you know, being an Iri&s;hman, and labelled the bottles wrong; &s;o that I &s;wallowed the embrocation and rubbed my&s;elf with the cordial mixture.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of all this was, that the embrocation, having in it a plentiful quantity of opium, &s;et me to &s;leep. This &s;leep they mi&s;took for death. It is a pity but I had been a Roman Catholic, I &s;hould have been waked; and being put into my coffin, and afterwards into my grave, ju&s;t as the words, "a&s;hes to a&s;hes, and du&s;t to du&s;t," were repeated, and the &s;exton had thrown a &s;hovel of dirt upon me, whether from the noi&s;e, or the cold, or whether the in|fluence of the opiate had cea&s;ed, I know not, but I awoke, knocked pretty &s;toutly, and was let out.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="202">
'It turned out a glorious thing. The manager doubled my &s;alary, under an idea that my &s;tory would excite curio&s;ity. He had it made into a farce, where I acted a dead man to the life. I got a good benefit, grew quite a favourite; why, Sir, my death immortalized me!</P>
<P>'About this time, one Me&s;&s;ink had an offer to manage the Theatre at Calcutta, I fancy this was ju&s;t about when you re|turned from France. He made me a very liberal propo&s;al to take me with him as his factotem; and under an idea that I &s;hould find captain Higgins there, after maturely weighing all con&s;equences, after con&s;idering that I had not a friend, nor an acquaintance upon the face of the earth, except your&s;elves, that cared three far|things whether I made my exit off the &s;tage, or out of the world, I determined to try my fortune among &s;avages and men of Inde.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
'After boxing the compa&s;s and buf|fetting the billows for eight or nine months, I arrived in the kingdom of Bengal. Me&s;&s;ink fir&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the theatre, and I, in quality of trea&s;urer, prompter, property man, and, occa&s;ionally, perfor|mer. In &s;hort, the &s;crub of the family, ac|cording to Dr. John&s;on's explanation of factotum, began to enter upon my vo|cation.</P>
<P>'My next idea was to enquire after captain Higgins. But, Lord, how did I know that Surat was on the other &s;ide of the Indian penin&s;ula? I had taken it in my head that it was only a &s;tone's throw from Calcutta. Well, &s;aid I, travellers mu&s;t be content. So on we went a&s;to|ni&s;hing the Nabobs. Well, well, &s;aid I, the&s;e rupees are no bad things.</P>
<P>'Thus time wore on. There were we lolling in Ea&s;tern luxury. Still all I thought of was &s;omehow or other to get
<PB N="203" REF="204">
at the captain. I ventured two letters, but I found afterwards they never reached him. At la&s;t, like Cleopatra on the river Cydnus,
<Q><L>"Her galley down, the &s;ilver Cydnus rolled,</L>
<L>"Purple the &s;ails, the &s;treamers waved with gold."</L></Q>
comes the captain, &s;ailing up the Ganges, as &s;tately as a &s;wan upon the Thames. Played Serjeant Kite for my benefit. All the gentlemen u&s;ed to play at Calcutta. Oh how I have heard them tear a pa&s;&s;ion to rags! A better thing for me than the black&s;mith at Birmingham.</P>
<P>'I never was &s;o rejoiced in my life. Well, we had talk enough about you. This was ju&s;t after your brother had put you on board the Gro&s;venor for England. "You &s;ee," &s;aid my brother, "that I had no intention of going higher on the Cora|mandal Coa&s;t than Madras; but finding I &s;hould not be able to get my credentials
<PB N="204" REF="205">
&s;o properly from the Nabob, and meeting, with an advantageous offer to carry a freight, I was prevailed upon to &s;tand on for Calcutta. It was curious enough, that Jack He wit, &s;hould have quitted Madras only a week, by his account, before I ar|rived at it, not that it would have made any difference, for if I had met with him, in&s;tead of his going to Surat, I &s;hould have &s;ent him packing after you."</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid I, it would have made a material difference; for, in that ca&s;e, I certainly &s;hould not have &s;een him here, nor would any thing, perhaps, have turned out as it has. I have remarked with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, the &s;teps that have led to this wonderful meeting, and my mind is com|pletely made up; the hand of Providence is in it all&mdash;but go on Mr. Walme&s;ley.</P>
<P>'Faith Ma'am,' &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'there is not much to &s;ay. I could divide and &s;ub|divide
<PB N="205" REF="206">
all the little non&s;en&s;es that make up a life &s;o frivolous and in&s;ignificant as mine but it would be only to retail the former narrative which made you laugh &s;o at Wolverhampton. Actors, either off or on the &s;tage, like mill hor&s;es, go on the &s;ame dull round, another and another &s;till &s;ucceeds, and the la&s;t fool's as &s;tupid as the former.</P>
<P>'Your brother would fain have had me &s;camper with him over the Red Sea; but hold you, hold you, &s;aid I, I cod there may be mi&s;chief enough done without I! I am a re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, they may want to lay me. An obvious joke, a fooli&s;h figure, but farewell it, for I will be brief.</P>
<P>'Captain Higgins finding I would not accompany him, made me faithfully pro|mi&s;e him to wait until his return, telling me that we would then take a trip to En|gland, where he had no doubt but we
<PB N="206" REF="207">
&s;hould find you and Hewit happy and comfortable; and then, &s;aid he, we'll lay all our hulks in a convenient birth, where when the voyage of life &s;hall be at an end, we may take a &s;pell of &s;leep, out of which we &s;hall never wake till the angel Gabriel pipes all hands.</P>
<P>'I was charmed with this, for I love to cope with him in the&s;e humours, for then he is full of matter. So being a devil of a fellow at promi&s;e, he found me when he came back exactly in the &s;ame place where he left me, &s;tuck as fa&s;t as if I had been one of the twelve Cae&s;ar's done by a &s;eal|cutter. I found him exactly the &s;ame creature; &s;moked as many &s;agars, drank as much grog, cracked as many jokes, and did as many good natured things as ever.</P>
<P>'Away we went to work, &s;old our &s;hip and cargo, &s;acked the rupees, and pre|pared all matters for our return to the
<PB N="207" REF="208">
land of beef and pudding. Every thing now appeared as if it was coming to a climax; we &s;eemed as if we were all to meet together like players at the end of the la&s;t act. One morning as captain Hig|gins and I were going along, we met cap|tain Higgins&mdash;' "Why what a &s;tupid fellow you are, &s;aid my brother, how could I meet my&s;elf? You mean Hewit."</P>
<P>'No, I don't; we did not meet Hewit till three days afterwards; I mean, Oh Lord, I mean Mr. Binns, that's the gentle|man's name, I think. So you &s;ee Binns and the young gentleman, that is to &s;ay, Hewit, no Higgins.' 'Come, come, &s;aid I, Mr. Walme&s;ley, you are going to give us the &s;econd edition of the prince and the fi&s;herman.' 'No I en't, &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'there was no fi&s;herman in the ca&s;e, the gentleman is&mdash;but here's Jack Meggot, who does not wi&s;h you to know it, will tell you the whole &s;tory in two minutes, while I have been half an hour explain|ing

it, and you don't know any thing about it yet.'</P>
<P>"The fact is," &s;aid my brother, "we met with Binns, and afterwards with Hewit, and a friend or two more; and having agreed with a Dane to bring us to Eu|rope, here we all are, and I hope you are glad to &s;ee us. What do you &s;ay to that Hannah?"</P>
<P>Nothing, &s;aid I. 'Nothing can come of nothing,' &s;aid Walme&s;ley; '&s;peak again.' If I did, &s;aid I, it would an&s;wer no pur|po&s;e; there is certainly &s;ome my&s;tery be|hind; and as I have had enough within the&s;e la&s;t four and twenty hours to put my re&s;olution to the te&s;t, you are right to manage my feelings le&s;t they &s;hould be too much overcome. Only, &s;aid I, let me know the complexion of what I am yet to hear.</P>
<P>We have nothing to di&s;clo&s;e to you,

my dear Hannah, &s;aid Hewit, but what will give you plea&s;ure, and here comes a proof of it. At the&s;e words a mo&s;t charm|ing young man entered the room, and falling at my feet a&s;ked my ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VI. CONTAINING THE HISTORY OF AN EXEMPLARY YOUNG MAN, SOME PERTINENT OBSERVATIONS, AND A FURTHER DISCOVERY.</HEAD>
<P>No one but a mother can judge of the &s;en&s;ations I felt when I &s;trained in my arms the very pratler, now grown into man|hood, who u&s;ed to delight me on my little i&s;land, where, in the mid&s;t of pro&s;perity, I would retire to get rid of the world's im|pertinence.</P>
<P>I had early traced an under&s;tanding in this dear boy mo&s;t uncommonly pene|trating for his years, which increa&s;ed a&s;to|ni&s;hingly as he grew up. His mind pur|&s;ued
<PB N="211" REF="212">
every thing with &s;uch avidity, that his intelligence was unbounded, and his di&s;crimination was &s;o nice and per&s;picuous, that in all my ob&s;ervation and my reading I never met &s;uch a rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>As a proof of his capacity, he taught him&s;elf Arabic, and the language of the Hindoos, on his pa&s;&s;age out to India, and it was through the&s;e advantages that he was appointed, though little more than a child, to a con&s;iderable &s;ituation up the country.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e advantages, his manners were the mo&s;t winning in the world. To the &s;weete&s;t and evene&s;t tem|per, he added the mo&s;t &s;olicitous and con|ciliating attention. He was as brave as fortitude without ra&s;hne&s;s, and as mild as humility without meanne&s;s. What joy then to behold after &s;o long an ab&s;ence &s;uch a &s;on, &s;uch a trea&s;ure! I can only &s;ay
<PB N="212" REF="213">
my joy, unaccu&s;tomed as I was to plea|&s;ure, was immoderate; and, if in the full|ne&s;s of my heart, I now recall it upon pa|per, let no one but a parent comment on it. Tho&s;e who are not parents may think I have &s;aid too much, every parent will wonder I could &s;ay &s;o little.</P>
<P>My &s;on at my earne&s;t de&s;ire related the particulars of his fortune, which might make a little novel by it&s;elf, and be called the Progre&s;s of Indu&s;try; for never were there talents &s;o worthily em|ployed, pur&s;uits &s;o &s;en&s;ibly planned, &s;o re&s;olutely undertaken, or &s;o laudably pur|&s;ued. It &s;poke him the true Engli&s;hman of oppulence; with &s;pirit, abilities, and accompli&s;hments, to repel a foe, regulate a counting hou&s;e, or ornament a &s;enate.</P>
<P>Were the country invaded, he did his duty bravely in the field; were the produce of the Ea&s;t to be wa&s;ted acro&s;s the Pacific Ocean to agrandize his native
<PB N="213" REF="214">
country, he e&s;timated the honourable average of lo&s;s and gain, and and regulat|ed account between merchant and mer|chant. If the exigencies of the &s;tate rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to call in &s;uperior abilities, his voice was the mo&s;t eloquent in the coun&s;el. In &s;hort he was a pattern for what a young man &s;hould be, and what almo&s;t any young man tolerably gifted may be, by nothing more than keeping this one &s;imple maxim in view, never to be indolent.</P>
<P>Would not one imagine with &s;uch ad|mirable talents, &s;uch true rectitude, that this dear youth was not wherever he came an object of e&s;teem and re&s;pect! Nothing like it. He was the perpetual object of envy and calumny. Every poltroon en|vied his bravery, every knave his inte|grity, and every fool his under&s;tanding. He was tracherou&s;ly &s;tabbed by a cow|ardly a&s;&s;a&s;in; who, fancying he had kil|led him, took the honour to him&s;elf of a
<PB N="214" REF="215">
glorious action the &s;weet youth had nobly performed; fal&s;e accounts had been &s;ur|reptiou&s;ly foi&s;ted into &s;ome bills of lading, of which he had the regulation, by a &s;windling adventurer with a view to im|peach his honour; and a charge of inten|tion to innovate and new mould the &s;tate, had &s;ubjected him to a tryal for having uttered an oration, that for eloquence might have honoured Demo&s;thenes, and for wi&s;dom have given reputation to Solon.</P>
<P>Thus, an honour to human nature, human nature did every thing it could to di&s;honour him. His good &s;en&s;e was &s;hrewdne&s;s and a di&s;gui&s;e for knavery, his mode&s;ty, &s;lyne&s;s and cloak for hypocri&s;y, if he was humble it was di&s;&s;imulation, if manly it was temerity, in &s;hort we were mother and &s;on; and having perhaps our minds a little better &s;tored than our neighbours, they, poor creatures, &s;eemed to
<PB N="215" REF="216">
have nothing for it but to lower our fa|culties, to the level of theirs.</P>
<P>The be&s;t trait of his mind was that, though a mi&s;anthrope, he was not a man hater. He did not di&s;pi&s;e his fellow crea|tures, he pitied them. All which in a young man no more than one and twenty, may be con&s;idered as pre&s;umption, and perhaps impertinence, but when it is re|collected that this young man of one and twenty, had thought more and to better purpo&s;e in any given month, than many an old man of &s;ixty does during his whole life, the wonder will be with all the &s;trong affections and antipathies of youth to &s;ti|mulate his choice, his mind did not harden into hate, rather than &s;often into pity.</P>
<P>Yet ought not his ill treatment to prevent any young man from a&s;piring. Knowledge is a mo&s;t charming compa|nion; and upon the principle which the
<PB N="216" REF="217">
proverb holds out, that a contented mind is a continual fea&s;t, &s;o an accompli&s;hed mind is a continual amu&s;ement; be&s;ides there is a great con&s;olation in not de&s;erv|ing to be ill treated, and the calumny of the world will little affect a man of good &s;en&s;e, while the rectitude of his heart contradicts it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the con&s;ideration reaches far|ther. Benefits ari&s;ing from the gifts of nature induce gratitude, gratitude in|&s;pires every other virtue, and thus the human mind has a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ures within it&s;elf, and every plea&s;ure the re&s;ult of reffection. But I entreat the reader to pardon me for this intru&s;ion. I could not avoid recommending this valuable con|duct, &s;o exemplified in my own &s;on, and explaining its advantages that young men may &s;ee, however, envy may pur&s;ue in|du&s;trious merit, it cannot le&s;&s;on its &s;terling value, whereas the vice and folly that &s;prings from indolence; however men of
<PB N="217" REF="218">
&s;en&s;e may pity, is the but of every fool, and the prey of every knave.</P>
<P>During my &s;on's relation of his &s;tory, which he delivered in mode&s;t and elo|quent language, I could not help noticing that he continually alluded to the obliga|tions he was under to his uncle, notwith|&s;tanding my brother was at no part of the time in the way, to do him any per&s;onal &s;ervice. I therefore concluded that he had &s;et agents about him to watch his conduct, and be of occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him.</P>
<P>This I hinted, and was very thankful to my brother, for his tender care of his nephew. 'Ava&s;t,' &s;aid my brother, 'put the &s;addle upon the right hor&s;e, I knew very little about my nephew; nay, to own the truth, as I never love to make the wor&s;t of any thing, what I told you

at Surat, about his &s;ituation at Benares was only hear&s;ay.</P>
<P>'I had many vague and &s;trange conjec|tures concerning my nephew at that time, but to have tormented you with them would not only have been unnece&s;&s;ary, but cruel; for if he was in a &s;ituation to need friends or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, your interference could have done him no &s;ervice, I there|fore, amu&s;ed you with what I thought would mo&s;t con&s;ole you, without making you wretched about your &s;on, when you were already &s;ufficiently wretched about your hu&s;band.'</P>
<P>'But however,' &s;aid he, 'it came upon its legs in the end; for though I did not get the news till my return from the Red Sea, had I &s;taid but a fortnight longer be|fore I &s;ailed on that voyage, I &s;hould not only have known that the flying report of his being well &s;ituated at Benares was

<P>What uncle! &s;aid I, in a&s;toni&s;hment, but ble&s;s me here are ladies and with them a gentleman I never &s;aw before. 'Well, &s;aid Domine,' &s;aid my brother, 'he &s;ticks clo&s;e to the women.' "Yes," &s;aid Wal|me&s;ley, "but he is hone&s;t for all he wears black." 'Give me leave good folks to in|troduce you,' &s;aid my brother.

<P>Here, my old friend whom I had known by the name of Binns, came up and warmly &s;aluted me, calling me her dear &s;i&s;ter. Heavens! &s;aid I, what am I to think of this, brother?

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. THE STORY OF BINNS.</HEAD>
<P>BEING a little recovered from the a&s;to|ni&s;hment into which I had been thrown, I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to my friends around me in terms of the warme&s;t gratitude for the thoughtful, the delicate manner, in which they had introduced this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;coveries; which, &s;trong as my mind was, had they been more abrupt might have been attended with the wor&s;t con&s;e|quences; and what endeared their conduct doubly to me was, that it could ari&s;e from no motive but tender and kind con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">
What a rever&s;e of fortune did I now experience. I had not only a hu&s;band re&s;tored to me, who had been the object of all my pain and plea&s;ure during my life, but I had a &s;on that I could proudly own. I had one brother, of who&s;e fra|ternal affection I had received a thou&s;and proofs, and another who had proved him|&s;elf every way a brother, at the time I knew him &s;or no other than a kind and di&s;intere&s;ted friend. Be&s;ides my tender friend who I had long loved, was now my &s;i&s;ter; and no wonder if &s;uch unlooked for happine&s;s, required the exertion of my utmo&s;t &s;ortitude.</P>
<P>After a peal of congratulations, and many &s;uitable remarks on the wonderful chain of events, that had &s;o miraculou&s;ly brought us together, my new brother at my particular reque&s;t, related his &s;tory, with which it is now high time I &s;hould acquaint the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="225">
'You all know," &s;aid my brother, 'that a per&s;on of the name of Binns, lived in Coalbrook Dale, who though he was him&s;elf of an idle and a profligate character, had for a wife a mo&s;t worthy and amiable woman. I have heard Mr. Wil|liams, when I believed her to have been my mother, &s;peak of her in terms of the highe&s;t prai&s;e, and well he might, if &s;he bore the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;emblance to her daughter, who&s;e virtues, when I thought her my &s;i&s;ter, were ever the objects of my admiration, and &s;ince &s;he has been my wife, now eighteen years, they have manife&s;ted them&s;elves in &s;o many tender and attentive in&s;tances of affectionate kindne&s;s, which Heaven knows, have been rigourou&s;ly put to the te&s;t, that I mu&s;t be, which I hope is not in my nature, mo&s;t di&s;honourable and ungrateful, if I did not, through life, make her happine&s;s my &s;tudy.</P>
<P>'You have heard, that in the year 1743,
<PB N="225" REF="226">
there was an explo&s;ion in a coal mine, this unfortunate woman, with &s;everal other per&s;ons, and particularly a brother of yours called Peter, were killed; but this was not the fact, for it was my wife's bro|ther that was killed, and not yours, I am your brother, and the extraordinary cir|cum&s;tance of my being brought up as the &s;on of Binns, aro&s;e from nothing more than that having lo&s;t his &s;on, and knowing that the countenance and &s;upport of his &s;i&s;ter would wholly depend on the chance of her having a male heir to keep up her name, he &s;tole me, who happened to be on the &s;pot, though unhurt, carried me home, pa&s;&s;ed me for his &s;on, which deceit my age and complexion favoured, and thus accom|pli&s;hed his de&s;igns again&s;t the pur&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Good Heaven, &s;aid I, what art! "Yes, madam," &s;aid Walme&s;ley, "and thus you
<PB N="226" REF="227">
&s;ee the ear of Denmark was abu&s;ed with a feigned &s;tory of his death."</P>
<P>'Mrs. Binns,' continued my brother, 'when &s;he made her will, at which time &s;he fancied I was her nephew, re&s;tricted both me and her daughter from a&s;&s;i&s;ting her brother to the injury of our own cir|cum&s;tances. This, however, did not pre|vent his levying contributions on us both; until at la&s;t his conduct was &s;o arrogant that had I not &s;uppo&s;ed him my father, I &s;hould have broke up all &s;ort of commu|nication with him, which he &s;aw, and I could plainly perceive he was bent on &s;ome &s;ort of revenge.</P>
<P>'About this time a clerk of our wor|thy brother, the lawyer, called upon me, and &s;aid he had &s;omething to communicate that nearly concerned me. I was &s;hy of him at fir&s;t; but finding that the confe|dracy, for whom he often perjured him|&s;elf,
<PB N="227" REF="228">
had marked him for de&s;truction on account of &s;ome di&s;coveries he had made, which put them a good deal in his power, I had no farther doubt that he meant to &s;erve me, e&s;pecially as my own ears were to be witne&s;&s;es of what he wanted me to believe.</P>
<P>'He told me that the mi&s;chief which threatened me was planned by his ma&s;ter, and my reputed father; that he did not know the nature of it, but in&s;tructed me where to place my&s;elf &s;o as to hear a con|ver&s;ation between them. He &s;aid he cer|tainly had an eye to reward but would not accept a halfpenny until I was convinced he de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>'This was &s;o fair that I concealed him until I had &s;atisfied my&s;elf, and having done &s;o, I gave him money for the pur|po&s;e of affecting his e&s;cape. What I learnt was the &s;ecret of my being your brother,
<PB N="228" REF="229">
and this con&s;ultation, between Binns and the lawyer, was to &s;ee how they could make it turn to their mutual account. They had no doubt, when I found that I had no preten&s;ion to any part of Mr. Binns's fortune, but I &s;hould be glad enough to come into any propo&s;al that they might hold out to me.</P>
<P>'A variety of &s;chemes were hit upon, at la&s;t a mo&s;t fortunate one, as they thought &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, which was that my &s;up|po&s;ed father &s;hould make me acquainted with the truth, and advi&s;e me to agree with him in &s;aying that I was not the impo&s;tor but that his daughter was; in which ca&s;e I might in&s;i&s;t upon the whole property, half of which he was to receive as a reward for his treachery in my behalf.</P>
<P>'The lawyer was not to appear in it, but he and his friends, with whom Mr. Binns &s;eemed to have been pretty well ac|quainted, were to have a fellow feeling.
<PB N="229" REF="230">
Apprized as I was of all that was to fol|low, I had made up my mind as to how I &s;hould act. Having heard the propo&s;al, I begged to con&s;ider of it, and after a time appeared reluctantly to yield to it.</P>
<P>'In the mean time it was extremely difficult to &s;ay what ought to be my real conduct. I was determined certainly not to conceal a tittle of the truth, but it &s;truck me, that if I managed adroitly, I might get at the knowledge of &s;ome of tho&s;e honourable practices in which my dear brother, the lawyer, and his worthy confederate Sourby, were engaged.</P>
<P>'With this view I played with the bu|&s;ine&s;s, and it turned out as I expected. Mr. Binns, not being &s;o artful as the re&s;t of the fraternity, &s;oon made me acquainted with a few tran&s;actions, which as I had wi&s;hed for a full revenge on Sourby, gave me a particular plea&s;ure, I promi&s;ed him mountains, and which was greatly to his
<PB N="230" REF="231">
ta&s;te, that I would conceal a large part of the property, and make it appear le&s;s than it was, in order that he might with the greater facility cheat his friends out of their &s;hare. In &s;hort, &s;aid I, one night as I let him out of the garden, &s;ucceed in this, meaning a further di&s;covery, and I'll make your fortune.'</P>
<P>'Which my&s;terious words, &s;aid I, my dear &s;i&s;er and I con&s;trued into a proof of your guilt.' "I know it," &s;aid my brother, "indeed all my conduct mu&s;t have ap|peared very &s;trange to you at that time. My turning from the lover to the friend and brother, my &s;olicitude in favour of Hewit, all which, I declare, delighted me more than any &s;atisfaction I had ever felt in my life, and then the pro&s;pect I had of expo&s;ing, and, perhaps, puni&s;hing Sourby; all, filled my mind, even though my whole fortune &s;hould have been the &s;acrifice, with reflections that my honour ap|proved.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">
'I hope I ever had a plea&s;ure in &s;hew|ing my&s;elf a di&s;intere&s;ted character, and, among the re&s;t, it was from this motive that I &s;eized the opportunity with &s;o much ala|crity of going to town at the time we re|ceived the fal&s;e intelligence that one of our corre&s;pondents had &s;topt payment, but I little dreamed that from Mr. Binns's tardine&s;s the worthy knot growing &s;u&s;pici|ous, had not only cho&s;e to remove me out of the way, that I might be &s;u&s;pected of having committed the fraud of the notes, which they were then meditating, but their worthy friend al&s;o, that, under an idea we were father and &s;on, we might mutually be &s;ubject to the &s;ame &s;u&s;picion in Wolver|hampton, to exonerate them.</P>
<P>'The remainder of my fortune, which I &s;hall relate in as &s;ummary a way as po&s;|&s;ible, is of another complexion. I had &s;carcely alighted at an inn in the Borough when I was forced into a hou&s;e in St. George's Fields, by &s;ome kidnappers. I
<PB N="232" REF="233">
was then, in the night conveyed to Grave&s;|end, put on board an Indiaman, afterwards taken to Port&s;mouth, and from thence the &s;hip went to &s;ea; nor did I get rid of my handcuffs, which had been put on me un|der the idea that I was a de&s;erter, till we cleared the channel.</P>
<P>'Being arrived in India I was put into the ranks; and as I had been &s;ent abroad with a bad character, I was pretty hand|&s;omely di&s;ciplined. I bore it, however, with what fortitude I could, and it was not long before an officer of &s;ome con&s;i|deration, &s;eeing &s;omething about me above my condition, payed me attention, and in in a &s;hort time got me promoted to a halbert.</P>
<P>'I was now glad that I had an oppor|tunity of &s;erving the poor &s;oldiers; who, having been for the mo&s;t part kidnapped in the &s;ame manner that I had, were ex|clu&s;ive of the inconvenience of &s;truggling
<PB N="233" REF="234">
with a &s;trange climate, &s;ubject to many hard&s;hips which they had no right to ex|perience.</P>
<P>'One day I &s;aw two men chained to|gether at a di&s;tance; and a&s;king who they were, was informed that they were two notorious rogues whom the &s;oldiers were bringing to me that I might repre&s;ent their ca&s;e to the officer. Under the idea that I could &s;erve two fellow creatures, I was charmed at an opportunity of inve&s;tigating the crime laid to their charge, which I imagined, as u&s;ual, was in&s;tigated to get &s;mart money from them; but judge my a&s;toni&s;hment when I learnt that they were accu&s;ed of no le&s;s than an intention of be|traying me, at the head of a &s;erjeant's guard, to the enemy, on the very next morning, when I was to have been on duty on a reconnoitering party, and how that a&s;toni&s;hment was increa&s;ed when I found them to be Binns and Dark.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
'My &s;ituation, at this moment, was very critical. I had certainly no affection for Dark, but could not bear that one I had &s;o long con&s;idered as my father, and who, in reality, was the father of her I had been accu&s;tomed to love and e&s;teem as my &s;i&s;ter, &s;hould &s;uffer at my in&s;tance an ignominious death, for it was my duty to become his accu&s;er. I, therefore, ordered that they might be remanded, and &s;aid that I &s;hould inform the commanding officer of their crime and i&s;&s;ue his orders accord|ingly.</P>
<P>'In the mean time as I had not owned them, and they dared not own me, they thought, in a con&s;ultation together, they might turn the tables, and by accu&s;ing me, &s;ave them&s;elves, which would an&s;wer all their original purpo&s;e; for the moment they had found I was in the camp, and their &s;uperior in rank, thinking, becau&s;e they would have &s;erved me &s;o, that as &s;oon as I di&s;covered them I &s;hould take care,
<PB N="235" REF="236">
right or wrong, to have them puni&s;hed, they concerted this &s;cheme to get me out of the way.</P>
<P>Little, however, &s;u&s;pecting this, I went to the officer, who had promoted me, and hone&s;tly informed him who they were, and my wi&s;hes concerning them. I a&s;ked his advice as to how I ought to act upon &s;o delicate an occa&s;ion, and intreated him as far as he could properly to indulge my feelings, which he him&s;elf applauded. He promi&s;ed to do every thing becoming in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and advi&s;ed me, without re|&s;erve, to acquaint the commanding officer with what I had been told concerning them, without introducing any thing relative to my&s;elf, or appearing to be in any re&s;pect intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>'I did as I was de&s;ired, but the next morning I was &s;urrounded by &s;ix men, de|prived of my &s;word, and made a pri&s;oner.
<PB N="236" REF="237">
I was immediately tried by a court martial; Binns and Dark were my accu&s;ers, who &s;wore I had inveigled them to a&s;&s;i&s;t in be|traying my guard to the enemy, with whom I had concerted a plan to &s;urprize the camp; which, after putting the picquets to the &s;word, they had no doubt, led on by me, apparently a friend, they &s;hould completely rout, and thus, at lea&s;t, di&s;|concert our mea&s;ures for the whole cam|paign.</P>
<P>'This te&s;timony was corroborated by a corporal, a &s;hocking fellow, who I cer|tainly hated, becau&s;e of his cruelty to the men, and over who&s;e head I had become a &s;erjeant. My patron and benefactor &s;aid what he could for me certainly, but, after all, he him&s;elf had no po&s;itive knowledge of me, and if I had deceived him, it only proved the con&s;ummate art I mu&s;t have been ma&s;ter of. In &s;hort, the &s;tory was &s;o well told, and &s;o artfully conducted, that I was found guilty of an intention of be|traying
<PB N="237" REF="238">
the Engli&s;h troops to the enemy, and &s;entenced to be &s;hot the very next morning.</P>
<P>'The awful preparations were making. The coffin was brought into my cell, the flannel wai&s;tcoat was prepared, the drums were muffled, and every other ceremony u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, was going for|ward, when my friend, the officer, ru&s;hed in, &s;truck off my fetters, and told me I was pardoned.</P>
<P>'It &s;eems, on the evening of the day I was tried, the officers had met in a coun|&s;el of war, when it was reported that the &s;erjeant, who had undertaken the po&s;t of honour I was to have commanded in the morning, and which, by the way, was a matter concerted between my patron and I, as a guide to my further promotion, had been &s;urrendered and taken by the enemy, but that a quarter guard coming up they were re&s;cued, and the enemy made
<PB N="238" REF="239">
pri&s;oners in return. This appeared, at fir&s;t, to corroborate my guilt; but it was afterwards clearly found that Binns and Dark had concerted the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and had been in the enemy's camp to give them intelligence; and particularly cau|tioned them not to expect my participa|tion in the plan, for on the contrary, their wi&s;e&s;t way would be to execute me imme|diately, le&s;t &s;omething &s;ini&s;ter &s;hould fol|low, which I was capable of planning, and bold enough to execute; and in con|&s;equence of this they were actually going to hang the poor &s;erjeant, my &s;ub&s;titute, when, as I &s;aid before, the quarter guard came up and &s;urrounded them.</P>
<P>'Binns and Dark were immediately &s;ent for and told that their iniquity was di&s;covered. My friend, who was now charmed to have an opportunity of inve&s;ti|gating whether I de&s;erved his favour or not, upon the faith of my &s;tory, acquainted them with all tho&s;e particulars relative to
<PB N="239" REF="240">
me which happened at Wolverhampton; when, upon offering to produce evidence to &s;ub&s;tantiate every tittle of what he alledged, they fell on their knees and im|plored for mercy. We were, however, in &s;uch a &s;ituation that no mercy could be granted to &s;uch offenders, and they were both condemned to &s;uffer that death to which I had before been unju&s;tly &s;en|tenced.</P>
<P>'I was &s;till very wretched. My friend, the officer, &s;aw it, and promi&s;ed to do what he could to &s;ave the life of Binns. This, to be brief, he accompli&s;hed. Dark was &s;hot, and Binns drummed out of the regiment. His fate, however, was only po&s;tponed, for being afterwards received in a regiment of Seapoys, he was put to death by a faithful La&s;car in the moment of attempting for plunder, the life of that very officer who at my &s;olicitation had generou&s;ly &s;aved his.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241">
'While Binns and Dark were under &s;entence of death, I learnt from them how they had been &s;erved by their kind friends in England. Binns was kidnapped about the time I was, but they continued to make an in&s;trument of Dark till he had written you that letter, in which he told you my father and I were great rogues, and then he was handcuffed and &s;ent to keep company with his friends.</P>
<P>"Why Sir," &s;aid Walme&s;ley, "the&s;e tools do &s;uch rogues mo&s;t &s;ervice in the end, for when they have drained what they need, it is but &s;queezing them and &s;punge, they are dry again." 'Well &s;aid Walme&s;ley,' cried my elder brother. 'From Dark al&s;o I learnt,' continued my brother Peter, 'that it was to Sourby he betrayed you in Love-lane; and now hav|ing di&s;po&s;ed of them, I &s;hall proceed to other matters.</P>
<P>'My conduct was &s;o well approved

of during that campaign, that I obtained a pair of colours, and after it was over a lieutenancy, but to my great misfortune I lo&s;t my noble friend. He and I, and a few others, were &s;urrounded. I did what I could to defend him, and narrowly e&s;caped death my&s;elf, but we were &s;o out-numbered, that though a party came and &s;aved what few the conflict had left alive, he, after per|forming prodigies of valour, fell covered with wounds and glory.</P>
<P>'During a truce, our regiment hap|pened to be at Calcutta, where being fre|quently invited to the hou&s;es of large factors, and other oppulent &s;ettlers, I was told one day I &s;hould be introduced to &s;ome young ladies who had come over to India to get hu&s;bands.' "One of them in particular," &s;aid my friend, "would &s;uit you exactly, as you are a &s;oldier of fortune, for &s;he is very rich already, and makes no &s;cruple to declare that &s;he came

<P>'I thanked him for his compliment, and &s;aid, that &s;uch di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was a charming feature in a wife, after which, company coming in, we talked of different matters.

I have received a letter from the lady I &s;poke of, by way of excu&s;e for her not attending us, but it appears to me that you are the cau&s;e, for my letter enclo&s;es one to you, which &s;he begs I would de|liver to you, having heard you were to be here this evening, and not knowing, other|wi&s;e, how to direct to you."</P>

<P>THE LETTER CONTAINED THESE WORDS.</P>
<P>"IF Captain Higgins will have the goodne&s;s to call this evening at the hou&s;e of Me&s;&s;rs. Charteris and Co. he will &s;ee an old friend, who wi&s;hes particularly to &s;peak with him."</P>
<P>'Who do you think wrote that letter? The dear author of it is by your &s;ide; and the motive of that and every other part of her conduct is &s;o flattering, &s;o en|dearing to me, that no Hewit, dearly Hannah as he may love you, and worthily as you may de&s;erve him, &s;hall ever outdo me in tenderne&s;s and attention.</P>
<P>'I knew the hand writing, of cour&s;e,
<PB N="244" REF="245">
the moment I &s;aw it; but how &s;he could know me by the name of Higgins I could not conceive; indeed, &s;he little imagined &s;he was writing to me, but having heard from &s;ome friends, who were of the party, that one captain Higgins was to be there, &s;he, under an idea that it was my brother Thomas, was impatient to &s;ee him, in hopes of gathering &s;ome &s;ort of intelli|gence from him, and feared if &s;he put tho&s;e que&s;tions to him in a mixed com|pany, it might intere&s;t her too much.</P>
<P>'This caution happened to be very nece&s;&s;ary, for our interview was tender enough, as you may conceive. Her de|light at finding that I was not her brother, and my gratitude at hearing that &s;he had left her own country to ri&s;k the chance of hearing of me, were of too intere&s;ting a nature to be expre&s;&s;ed before witne&s;&s;es.

<P>'We were &s;oon torne, however, from each others arms.

'My &s;tay in England was only three weeks; where, with the approbation of the Ea&s;t-India Company, I re&s;igned my military employ, and accepted a civil one in the re&s;idency of Benares, for which place, on my arrival in India, I &s;et out with my wife and daughter.</P>
<P>'I had been at Benares three years, when I heard of the great merit of a young man at Oude, who&s;e name was Hewit, and with what addre&s;s he had defended him&s;elf again&s;t his enemies, who, jealous of &s;uch abilities in &s;uch a youth, had often attempted his overthrow. I had al&s;o heard of &s;ome brave actions that he had per|formed in the field, but as I knew &s;everal of the &s;ame name, as I had never heard that you had a &s;on, nor could conceive, if you had, through what channel he could be in India; though plea&s;ed with what I had heard in his prai&s;e, as I &s;hould be to hear the commendation of any other ex|traordinary

<P>'I had been at Benares about two years.

I &s;et out to Oude with my documents, and ju&s;t as his enemies were on the point of prevailing again&s;t him, begged leave to be heard. My de|fence of him was &s;o &s;ound, &s;o complete, that he was honourably acquitted, and
<PB N="248" REF="249">
tho&s;e who had planned his de&s;truction were attached.</P>
<P>'He con&s;idered me as a guardian an|gel &s;ent to &s;ave him; and in the cour&s;e of his mode&s;t acknowledgments for the &s;er|vice I had rendered him, we di&s;covered we were uncle and nephew. Finding that nothing could induce him to have any thing further to do with public affairs, and, indeed, being heartily tired my&s;elf of mixing with people who were not con|tented without multiplying their fortune through the medium of rapine and plun|der, which neither he nor I ever practi&s;ed, I invited him to Benares, where he re&s;ided with me the la&s;t three years; when, hav|ing &s;ome time giving up my employ, at the earne&s;t &s;olicitation of my wife, I agreed to leave India with a view to pa&s;s the re|mainder of our lives in England.</P>
<P>'Being arrived at Calcutta, we called on our friend Charteris, of whom en|quiring

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED, IF THE TERM COULD BE SO FAR STRAINED, THE LIVING APOTHEOSIS OF HANNAH HEWIT.</HEAD>
<P>As &s;oon as we had breakfa&s;ted, and were &s;eated on the lawn before my door, in view of all tho&s;e beautiful and picture&s;que ob|jects which I have &s;o frequently de&s;cribed, my company manife&s;ted &s;ome impatience to hear tho&s;e remarks on their various for|tunes which I told them I had to make, and for which I had &s;everally prepared them, as far as it was nece&s;&s;ary on the pre|ceding day.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition, on which I meant to ani|madvert,
<PB N="251" REF="252">
and which I begged to be al|lowed, was that &s;o many extraordinary and unheard of circum&s;tances could not have combined in &s;o remote a part of the world, to bring a number of friends toge|ther, friends &s;o dear to each other, friends who, out of that &s;mall circle, had nothing upon earth of value, without the expre&s;s intervention of providence.</P>
<P>If am an&s;wered, &s;aid I, that nothing is more common than for natives of En|gland to go to India, and that many friend|&s;hips have been formed there, which after|wards grew and improved at home, I &s;hall an&s;wer that it does not apply in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e. We none of us voluntarily went to India. We were impelled, beck|oned there, and by an irre&s;i&s;table impul&s;e; but, &s;aid I, what brought us here? A miracle! Performed, if we are wi&s;e, to complete our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The labrynth of our lives has been &s;o
<PB N="252" REF="253">
impervious, and the clue &s;o difficult to find, that if the whole had been invented and written down, it could not have been managed with more art. Is it not won|derful that my brother Peter no farther ex|plained him&s;elf in the lobby of the play|hou&s;e, and that all further explanation was prevented by our &s;etting out the next morning to France?</P>
<P>Again, notwith&s;tanding, my wretched brother, in acquainting my hu&s;band of Sourby's dete&s;table plot again&s;t our peace, mu&s;t have mentioned, over and over again, that the per&s;on called Binns was my brother, is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, that all the documents, in the che&s;t, &s;peak of every thing in &s;uch general terms, that I did not become acquainted with the cir|cum&s;tance until it was related ye&s;terday by my brother him&s;elf? No; the ec|clairi&s;&s;ement was to take place here; here we were to meet; here we were to compare notes; here we were to con&s;ult
<PB N="253" REF="254">
upon what footing to en&s;ure our future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Take up any one of our &s;tories, in almo&s;t any part of it, and you will find it a kind of index pointing to this day. Whenever we have been within a hair's breadth of individual happine&s;s, &s;ome &s;ingular event has prevented it; Why? That we might now be happy together. Nor could this happine&s;s be accompli&s;hed till the malignant fiends that were perpe|tually thwarting our hopes and refining our virtue, like gold in the fire, were no more.</P>
<P>When this event was confirmed, though at &s;o many di&s;tant parts of the world, Fate called us together as a &s;hepherd calls his &s;heep into the fold. Will you &s;ay this was chance? Was it chance that I have been three years on this de&s;olate i&s;land, as it were to expect you? Was it chance that my hu&s;band was hurried to different parts of the world for the &s;ame three years
<PB N="254" REF="255">
to touch at Calcutta? Was it chance that Mr. Walme&s;ley &s;hould be the &s;ame three years re&s;ident there? Was it chance that my brother Peter, after he had found my &s;on and &s;aved his reputation, &s;hould re&s;ide the &s;ame three years at Benares, and then bring him to the &s;ame &s;pot? Was it chance that brought &s;o many friends to the &s;ame place in one mind, with one de|termination, though no one of them indivi|dually knew of another's intention? And la&s;tly; when this band of friends were all met together, was it chance that &s;ent them to di&s;cover in &s;o remote, &s;o de&s;olate a &s;pot, the only object that would complete their happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Was this chance? Miracles do not happen by chance. No; we are a &s;et who&s;e uncommon trials have never warped us from our moral duties. Our lives have been watched by that eye that regards virtue with benignity, and this happy meet|ing is the reward of our truth and fidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256">
Let us now &s;ee how to be thankful for this ble&s;&s;ing. I have contemplated, I have weighed, I have con&s;idered, and I think, indeed, I know there is but one way. Nor let my ob&s;ervation be di&s;regarded; contemplation is more nearly allied to pro|phecy than is generally imagined. Beings, e&s;tranged from a conver&s;e with the world, if they cheri&s;h virtue almo&s;t commune with the Deity, and conclu&s;ions beam acro&s;s &s;uch minds, as rational as truth, and as cer|tain as fate.</P>
<P>I never yet mi&s;took the &s;alutary warn|ings conveyed in &s;uch &s;en&s;ations, nor can I tho&s;e which earne&s;tly a&s;&s;ail me at this moment. Dear friends, &s;o long lo&s;t, &s;o lately found, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to one an|other's happine&s;s, do not ca&s;t from you the certain, the valuable trea&s;ure you po&s;&s;e&s;s. I conjure you to &s;eize the only opportu|nity you have ever had in your power of &s;ecuring permanent bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Would you be completely ble&s;t, would
<PB N="256" REF="257">
ye never know care, nor anxiety, nor &s;or|row. Would ye e&s;cape the viles of trea|chery, the practice of villany, the malig|nity of envy, and all the accumulated mi|&s;eries and misfortunes certain to attend a communication with &s;ociety, tempt not the world again. Let us enjoy a happine&s;s which our fir&s;t parents &s;orfeited by indulg|ing a fatal curio&s;ity. We have here an Eden, it will be our own faults if we do not make it a Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>"Why, ay," &s;aid Walme&s;ley, "a man may rot even here." And why not, &s;aid I, Mr. Walme&s;ley? Have you found any thing in the world &s;o very grateful, &s;o very thankful, in return for all your labour in vain, good|ne&s;s and genero&s;ity, that &s;hould induce you to run the ri&s;k of getting into gaol again, or being buried alive for tho&s;e who did not care if you were buried in good earne&s;t? "Oh, no," &s;aid Walme&s;ley, "you mi&s;|under&s;tand me, I think with you. 'In &s;uch a &s;habby, ragged, ra&s;cally world, the po&s;t of honour is a private &s;tation.'</P>

<P>Can you tell me brother, &s;aid I, in what &s;tation happine&s;s is to be found? Is it in the cottage? No; the poor pea&s;ant &s;hall toil out a laborious and weari&s;ome life in penury and want, a &s;tranger even to that plenty lavi&s;hed on his ma&s;ter's hounds. Is it on the throne? No; the King &s;hall be a pattern of goodne&s;s and virtue, &s;hall love his &s;ubjects like his children, &s;hall &s;timulate them to honour by his example, &s;hall watch their intere&s;t, &s;tudy their wel|fare, conciliate and cheri&s;h their affections, and by gracious, great, and godlike quali|ties, manife&s;t him&s;elf as the vicegerent of the Deity; yet &s;hall &s;ome diabolical fiend, &s;ome lurking traytor, &s;ome dark a&s;&s;a&s;in,

&s;ome malignant foe to order, morality, and every &s;ocial virtue, be continually di&s;turb|ing his repo&s;e, and cowardly terrifying his amiable con&s;ort, and his lovely progeny, with the perpetual glare of a dagger.</P>
<P>Is this a world then in which a rea&s;on|able being &s;hould covet a re&s;idence? Where envy and her malignant train are perpetually upon the watch to bla&s;t every bud of virtue? In &s;uch a world to be accu&s;ed is to be condemned; and but for con&s;cious rectitude, which, to the world, carries no letter of recommendation, a man may as well be hanged at Tyburn as be honourably acquitted at the Old Bailey.</P>
<P>Let us then not &s;ully our happine&s;s by mixing with a world where virtue it&s;elf can find no &s;afety. We are all mortals, and, here at lea&s;t, are &s;ure that no temptation can corrupt us; for the human mind is mutable, and, like wax, is capable of re|ceiving
<PB N="259" REF="260">
various impre&s;&s;ions; and my re|flections have convinced me that perfection will continue &s;o long as it is &s;ecluded from the world, but too often, when it is mixed with the world, like a drop of milk in a &s;ink, it will be lo&s;t and confounded, par|taking of the colour, &s;tench, and quality, of that loath&s;ome filth in which it is ab|&s;orbed.</P>
<P>'For my own part,' &s;aid my brother Thomas, 'I certainly &s;hall not take your advice, but we are pretty nearly of a mind for all that; you chu&s;e your world in one &s;pot, I find mine wherever I go. Tho&s;e, you know, you wi&s;h to con&s;ider as friends, I only want acquaintance, though, I be|lieve, you will all do me the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, my heart is pretty warm too. but I'll tell you one rea&s;on for this whim of mine; I don't like any thing to touch me too nearly, it would make me a milk&s;op; therefore, while you refine on plea&s;ures, I
<PB N="260" REF="261">
take mine as they come; and this will be the con&s;equence; your enjoyments will be more perfect than mine, but you will find a bitterer pang than I &s;hall at parting from them.'</P>
<P>Heaven forbid, &s;aid I, my dear bro|ther, that I &s;hould u&s;e any arguments to induce you to do that of which you would repent, or wi&s;h that any fears with which I may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;hould &s;hake whatever re&s;olution you may have made. That would be to arraign the very Providence in which I &s;o implicitly put my tru&s;t. Should I tell you that I have been once &s;hipwrecked, and, therefore, dare not ven|ture in a &s;hip again, you would laugh at my womani&s;h apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>'Indeed I &s;hould,' &s;aid my brother, 'if you are afraid for me on that account, I thank you for your love, but give your|&s;elf no concern. I am none of your un|fortunate adventurers, who, like Dutch|men,
<PB N="261" REF="262">
are always a&s;hore &s;ome where or other; my way is to arrive &s;afe &s;hip and cargo. No, no, Old Boreas has too great a regard for me to do me any harm.'</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, I know not why, I bur&s;t into a flood of tears. 'Nay, nay,' &s;aid my brother, 'my dear Hannah, but you know this is&mdash;'I beg your pardon, &s;aid I, the &s;en&s;ation was involuntary, I a&s;&s;ure you I would not give you a moment's un|ea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;'Well, well,' &s;aid he, taking me tenderly by the hand, 'don't let your con|cern for me afflict you; I &s;hall arrive &s;afe in Old England never fear, and &s;o, I hope, will you for all your apprehen&s;ions.'</P>
<P>As for me, &s;aid I, I &s;olemnly vow to end my days in this place; my dear hu&s;|band has promi&s;ed to &s;tay with me, And now, though I have thought it a duty, a mo&s;t tender, a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, a mo&s;t &s;a|cred duty, to offer what I have &s;aid to all your reflections, I will not utter another
<PB N="262" REF="263">
word to influence any of your determina|tions, not even that of my &s;on. A choice of &s;o &s;erious a nature &s;hould be made from conviction, not from per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>"For me," &s;aid my brother Peter, "to my mind conviction has followed every word you have uttered. Sacred truth has fallen from your tongue, and I have felt the force of your arguments like in&s;pira|tion. Certainly every part of the world is new to us; and without your &s;ociety, we could be no where perfectly happy. I, therefore, mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare that if upon reflection my wife and daughter find nothing in it repugnant to their inclina|tions, I &s;hall con&s;ent to your propo&s;al up|on your own principle of chu&s;ing rational happine&s;s."</P>

<P>My niece was now con&s;ulted, who &s;weetly an&s;wered that &s;he &s;hould be im|plicitly guided by her father and mother. "Well, then," &s;aid my brother Thomas, "If that's the ca&s;e, my nephew Jack will &s;tay of cour&s;e." At the&s;e words, my &s;on and my niece blu&s;hed and looked con|founded. "That's right," faid my bro|ther, "don't be a&s;hamed of that, Old Diogenes &s;aid, 'that a blu&s;h was the co|lour of virtue.' The fact is, and I &s;uppo&s;e you have all &s;een it, that they love each other." 'We do,' &s;aid my &s;on, 'with the mo&s;t tender, the mo&s;t honourable af|fection.' "That," &s;aid my brother, "is what I call hone&s;ty. Well, &s;ince that's the ca&s;e, let Domine tack them together.

'Yes, but I will, though,' &s;aid Wal|me&s;ley, 'my fate cries out, "why, Lord, if I don't &s;tay they will have nothing to laugh at." Then turning to me, 'go on, I'll follow thee.'

He landed from the Dane &s;ome fine Arabian hor&s;es, a mare with foal, three goats, two kids, and &s;everal Chine&s;e pigs; all which kindne&s;s, however, he would very often interlard with ob&s;ervations of how rueful we &s;hould look when we once lo&s;t &s;ight of him, and what a glorious laugh he &s;hould have again&s;t us when we got tired and &s;ought our fortune in a &s;kiff of our own building.</P>
<P>I let him je&s;t while I wrote; mean while my hu&s;band, my brother, my &s;on and Walme&s;ley, were all cutting out bu|&s;ine&s;s, and planning plea&s;ure for us all; while my &s;i&s;ter, my niece, and Britannia were delighted to &s;ee their hu&s;bands &s;o rationally employed, and &s;tudying what way they could make their per&s;ons and their conduct mo&s;t agreeable to them. In

&s;hort, we began already to find our place a little heaven upon earth, and I could plainly &s;ee the only emulation among us would be who &s;hould mo&s;t endeavour to realize that idea.</P>
<P>In the evenings I u&s;ed to read to them what I had written in the cour&s;e of the day; in which they all agreed I had given a faithful repre&s;entation of their characters, and their fortunes. The comments ari&s;ing from what they heard were expre&s;&s;ions of wonder, and confirmations of their re&s;o|lution, which, as u&s;ual, produced a new effort to en&s;nare my brother into our plan, to which we generally received &s;ome &s;a|tirical compliment on our having minds &s;uperior to the re&s;t of our fellow creatures, and &s;ome &s;uch arch remark, as that he &s;hould try what he could to e&s;tabli&s;h a commercial treaty between Great Britain and her New Colony. "But," added he, "I don't &s;ee any thing at pre&s;ent you have
<PB N="271" REF="272">
to export but monkies, and we have plenty of tho&s;e already."</P>
<P>We, on our &s;ide, did not fail to rally him. When he a&s;ked us what he &s;hould do with our money? 'Take it,' &s;aid Wal|me&s;ley, 'we have &s;old you poi&s;on, you have &s;old us none.' Hewit told him, that by the time he had emptied his pur&s;e in &s;atisfying tho&s;e &s;harks the landlords, laying to for painted galleys, and relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of hone&s;t fellows, he would be|gin to think of his friends in the South Seas. "Well," &s;aid my brother, "if it &s;hould be &s;o, I have made a good ob&s;ervation, I know where to find you, and I am &s;ure you will give me a &s;nug birth. In that ca&s;e too, I &s;hall not only be able to bring Hannah an account of her life in print, but &s;hall be able to tell her how many con|verts her pains to reform the world will have produced, though between our&s;elves, Jack, I think, without any of her prophe|tic
<PB N="272" REF="273">
preten&s;ions, I could tell her that now. No, no, &s;he has a &s;trong mind, but I don't think it Herculean enough to clean&s;e that augean &s;table the world."</P>
<P>I told him that I had no hope of accom|pli&s;hing any &s;uch impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k. If the vice I had painted appeared ugly, and the virtue beautiful, it was all I had a right to expect; that done, men mu&s;t think for them|&s;elves. There is no telling mankind, &s;aid I, how to be right, nor how to be happy, that knowledge is born with us, and we feel in&s;ulted at hearing an explanation of what we already know. But it is not &s;imply to be happy, it is to be happy by rule, by mode, by ta&s;te; thus plea&s;ure leads to folly, folly to vice, and vice to misfortune, yet nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as to avoid the evil and chu&s;e the good, but it all ari&s;es from the perver&s;ene&s;s of human nature; and if Jupiter's tubs were pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly pre&s;ented to mortals for &s;ale,
<PB N="273" REF="274">
I know not whether the plagues would not turn out more marketable than the plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But my hi&s;tory is arrived at the very moment in which I am writing; I mu&s;t, therefore, arrange it, and depo&s;it it, with every nece&s;&s;ary document, in Hewit's che&s;t, that my brother may have every po&s;&s;ible proof, on his publi&s;hing it, that all the particulars it contains are true and genuine.</P>
<P>To-morrow we &s;hall all have the pain|ful ta&s;k of parting with that dear, that va|luable relation. The &s;hip will then be underweigh, Heaven &s;end that it may ar|river at its de&s;tined port. Many a tear will witne&s;s our &s;eparation, many a wi&s;h will be wafted in a &s;igh that the gale may be propitious; of what my feelings will be at parting, the reader mu&s;t form an idea, ju&s;t as a painter conceals a face his pencil can|not
<PB N="274" REF="275">
expre&s;s, and leaves that de&s;cription of the torne heart it ought to convey to the imagination of the &s;pectator.</P>
<P>And now, gentle reader, if I pant for peace, for ea&s;e, for tranquility, after &s;o much turbulence and trouble; if I prefer content and retirement to re&s;tlene&s;s and bu&s;tle; a quiet &s;pot to a bu&s;y world; an unknown ob&s;cure corner, to my own mag|nificent and flouri&s;hing country; think me not lo&s;t to ambition, to pride, to curio&s;ity, to popularity, I am a mortal and po&s;&s;e&s;s them all.</P>
<P>Rather commend me, that made up of pa&s;&s;ions in common with my fellow crea|tures, I am content to wage no future war with de&s;tiny. Look at my fortune and confe&s;s me born, not for my&s;elf, but for an example to others. Blame me not if I have learnt to know, that, in the world, friend&s;hip is a name, fame a bubble, ho|nour a je&s;t, merit a but for envy, beauty
<PB N="275" REF="276">
the ridicule of impudence, and virtue the prey of &s;lander. Be not hard with me if I grieve, that from the moment of my ob&s;cure birth to the moment of my &s;e|que&s;tration from the world, I never found, except in my dear brother, and tho&s;e who retire with me, a &s;ingle di&s;intere&s;ted friend.</P>
<P>Let unprecedented con&s;iderations ex|cu&s;e unprecedented conduct; and if, at la&s;t, I err, and in my error embrace my fate, let it induce, for my con&s;olation, and for your pity, a recollection of his Divine words, who has benificently taught us, that<Q>"THERE IS AN ESPECIAL PROVIDENCE IN THE FALL OF A SPARROW."</Q></P>
