<L>OUR modern Poets &s;carce know how to chu&s;e</L>

<L>A flow'ry pro&s;pect, and a boundle&s;s &s;ky:</L>
<L>But hard the ta&s;k the &s;ober path to chu&s;e,</L>

<L>&mdash;She dares not touch the Drama's <HI>nobler</HI> &s;trings,</L>
<L>The fate of nations, and the fall of Kings;</L>
<L>The humbler &s;cenes of private life &s;he &s;hews,</L>
<L>A &s;imple &s;tory of dome&s;tic woes.</L>
<L>The weight of crowns, a kingdom's weal or woe,</L>
<L>How few can judge, becau&s;e how few can know!</L>
<L>But here you all may boa&s;t the Critic's art,</L>
<L>Here, all are judges&mdash;who po&s;&s;e&s;s a heart.</L>
<L>To govern <HI>Empires</HI> is the lot of few,</L>
<L>But all who live have <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> to &s;ubdue;</L>
<L>And, ev'n by Patriots let it be confe&s;s'd,</L>
