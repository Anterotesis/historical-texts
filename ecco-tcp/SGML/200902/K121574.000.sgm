<L>Now in their &s;everal camps each Ho&s;t enwrapt</L>
<L>Retire; and War's tremendous thunder re&s;ts</L>
<L>Su&s;pended: when at once, their &s;udden flight</L>

<L>Scud as precipitant, as &s;low they advanc'd</L>
<L>E'erwhile.&mdash;But lo! the fierce confed'rate Pow'rs</L>
<L>Vaunting united terrors, onward move</L>
<L>Under their gallant Leaders, great SOUBISE</L>
<L>And HILDBURGHAUSEN. Their proud threats t'oppo&s;e</L>
<L>FREDERICK delay'd not: his a&s;&s;embled troops</L>
<L>He rang'd in ju&s;t array, and thus addre&s;s'd:</L>
<L>"My Friends, my Warriors brave!&mdash;The Foe's advanc'd;</L>
<L>PRUSSIA &s;hall meet them. Ha&s;te we to the field.</L>
<L>With you your FREDERICK conquers or expires.</L>

Think how we've fought! what glorious laurels won!</L>
<L>Think on the equitable plea, that drew</L>

<L>He ended; on he led his valiant files</L>
