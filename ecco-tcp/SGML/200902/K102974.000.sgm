<P>It may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to ac|quaint the reader, that Euripides has written a tragedy upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. In his <HI>Heraclidae,</HI> Macaria is &s;acrificed in the &s;econd act, and never afterwards mentioned; and <HI>Acamas</HI> is a mute. In|deed the whole conduct of this play is &s;o entirely different from that of the Greek poet, that the author is hardly con&s;cious to him&s;elf of having borrowed any thing more from him, than the general idea of the <HI>Suppliants</HI> taking refuge in the temple, and Macaria's voluntary offer of her own life.</P>

<L>WELL! the&s;e heroic times&mdash;I &s;carce can &s;peak&mdash;</L>
<L>The&s;e ancient fables, borrow'd from the Greek,</L>
<L>Are all &s;o full of pa&s;&s;ion, rage, and death,</L>
<L>So violent&mdash;they take away one's breath.&mdash;</L>
<L>Let me recover, pray:&mdash;this tragic &s;trife</L>
<L>Night after night,&mdash;leads me a weary life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' what variety of folks, long dead,</L>
<L>Through what &s;trange times and beings are we led!</L>
<L>Now a fond daughter trembling for her &s;ire;</L>
<L>Now Phaedra, burning with unlawful fire!</L>
<L>A heroine now, for Greece my brain I rack;</L>
<L>Now De&s;demona, &s;mother'd by a Black.</L>
<L>To take the&s;e various &s;hapes, and fill the whole,</L>
<L>An actre&s;s needs a tran&s;migrating &s;oul.</L>

<L>This night, you'll own, I've had full cau&s;e to mourn</L>
<L>A chief renown'd from my embraces torn.</L>
<L>Well might a widow weep the be&s;t of men!</L>
<L>Oh! &s;uch a hu&s;band I &s;han't have again.</L>
<L>With bright renown he fill'd the Ea&s;tern climes,</L>
<L>And differ'd, ladies, from the&s;e modern times.</L>
<L>In life's fir&s;t dawn, to deeds of terror bred,</L>
<L>The youthful hero cru&s;h'd the &s;erpent's head.</L>

In the&s;e our days, when men their object mi&s;s,</L>
<L>There are who like to hear the &s;erpent hi&s;s.</L>
<L>One thing there is, which I mu&s;t not di&s;gui&s;e;</L>
<L>Tho' brave, heroic, generous, and wi&s;e,</L>
<L>The lover, tam'd, a&s;ide his club could throw,</L>
<L>Chain'd to the di&s;taff, like a modern beau.</L>
</LG>

<L>Yet, all his toils and all his labours pa&s;t,</L>
<L>By death ev'n Envy was &s;ubdued at la&s;t.</L>
<L>We read, (&s;o &s;ays our bard) in Ovid's &s;tile</L>
<L>How for him&s;elf he rais'd the funeral pile.</L>
<L>There on his club reclining,&mdash;like a gue&s;t</L>
<L>With garlands crown'd&mdash;he &s;unk to endle&s;s re&s;t.</L>
<L>Yet even now, in the&s;e degenerate days,</L>
<L>Heroic virtue &s;till can merit prai&s;e.</L>
<L>When round the &s;hip, in the deep roaring tide,</L>

<L>With look &s;erene, and &s;till the foe defies,</L>
<L>He views the flame, he views the brawling wave,</L>
<L>Then &s;inks&mdash;undaunted &s;inks in glory's grave.</L>

<LG>
<L>May his example every brea&s;t in&s;pire,</L>
<L>And kindle thro' the land our antient fire.</L>
