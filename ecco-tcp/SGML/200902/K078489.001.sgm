<HEAD>DEDICATION, PREFACE, &amp;c. TO ALL THE CIRCULATING LIBRARIANS In the Kingdom of GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now fini&s;hed my fir&s;t Volume, for I con&s;ider it as a great Piece of Folly, or Pre&s;umption, or perhaps both, to prepare an elaborate Preface for a Work ab&s;olutely Non-exi&s;tent; ina&s;much as it implies a Man's being perfectly &s;atisfied with his own Capability of Writing &s;ome|thing worth Publi&s;hing, (for if it &s;hould not be worth publi&s;hing, a
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Preface to it would certainly be needle&s;s,) and likewi&s;e as it is contrary to the received and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Cu&s;tom of Mankind in mo&s;t other Matters; which, if I thought fit, I could prove by a Variety of In&s;tances. Having fini&s;h|ed my fir&s;t Volume I &s;ay then; and if <HI>Horace</HI>'s Doctrine of <HI>"Dimidium facti qui Cepit habet;"</HI> that is, "He who has begun has half done," be true; I, who have actually got through the <HI>Dimidium</HI> or half of my Work, may, by a Parity of Rea&s;oning, and according to the Rule of Proportions, be very fairly &s;aid to have completed it entirely: I begin to think fit that it &s;hould be embelli&s;hed with &s;ome Sort of Prefatory, Introductory, Dedica|tory Di&s;cour&s;e; and not having
<PB N="3" REF="5">
much Time to &s;pare at pre&s;ent, I de&s;ign the following Pages &s;hall an&s;wer any or all of the&s;e &s;everal Ends, according as I &s;hall find it convenient. As for the Dedicatees, or People to be dedicated to, hav|ing maturely deliberated on that Matter, I deem it mo&s;t proper to addre&s;s my&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Gratitude to my very generous Friends and Benefactors, as I hope they will be, the Circulating Li|brarians of this Kingdom, paying them in advance (which I think ought to weigh &s;omething with them,) my unfeigned Thanks for their very vigorous and &s;pirited Exertions in promoting the exten|&s;ive Sale of this little Production; and at the &s;ame Time humbly in|treating them, if they &s;hould find
<PB N="4" REF="6">
no farther mention of their very re&s;pectable Selves in the Cour&s;e of this Literary Midwife of mine, which, like other Midwives, has more nece&s;&s;ary Matters than Com|pliments to attend to, that they will not give way to the In&s;tiga|tions of a wrathful Efferve&s;cence, but will content them&s;elves, like good Trade&s;men, with the promi&s;|&s;ory Note of an Author, which I here give them my Honour &s;hall be found payable at Sight in the Conclu&s;ion, with all due Ceremo|nies of dedicatory Reverence, the foregoing Sentences no ways im|peding or hindering the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And now it may perhaps be ex|pected, that I &s;hould give &s;ome conci&s;e Account of the general Plan and Fable of my Book, toge|ther
<PB N="5" REF="7">
with the Rea&s;ons that fir&s;t in|duced me to &s;et about it, not for|getting a Variety of pretty Apolo|gies for the Inaccuracy of the Stile, and Infinity of other Defects which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to abound with, which, however, it is hoped will be all pa&s;&s;ed over, as the Author compo&s;ed it entirely in the Cour&s;e of three Weeks, <HI>"Stans Pede in Uno,"</HI> or when he was on a Journey, or when he was hardly recovered from a &s;evere Fit of Illne&s;s, and the like. And Pleas of this Sort I well know are con&s;idered by many Authors as a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for the utmo&s;t Ebullitions of Folly, as if writing Non&s;en&s;e with Faci|lity was any great Merit: nay, &s;o perfectly are their Minds &s;atisfied with this Salvo, that &s;hould the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
di&s;criminating Stomach of the Public find any accidental Nau&s;ea in &s;wallowing the Bolus, after it has been daubed with this apologe|tical Gilding, they do not &s;cruple to anathematize them altogether, as the mo&s;t illiterate, illiberal, undi&s;|cerning Blockheads that ever exi&s;ted. Now, in my Opinion, all this ag|gravates the Fault in&s;tead of pal|liating it; nor can I po&s;&s;ibly con|ceive more than one Ca&s;e or Situa|tion where the&s;e Arguments can be valid or admi&s;&s;ible, and that is, the <HI>Compul&s;io ex Paupertate.</HI> Anglic&egrave;, when a Man is a good deal behind Hand in the World, and is afraid of being troubled by his Landlord. And this not happening to be my Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, for I paid up to the End of my Quarter but <HI>Thur&s;|day</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
was Se'nnight la&s;t pa&s;t, I entirely lo&s;e the Benefit of the Exception, and am ab&s;olutely under an Obli|gation to write both Sen&s;e and Grammar according to my own Dogma. "Well, but as to the Plot and Characters of the Novel; &s;ome Sketch of the&s;e will be very proper and nece&s;&s;ary, and will doubtle&s;s be generally expected." I &s;hall certainly be thought a very rude Fellow, when I declare, that if this is the Ca&s;e, I am heartily &s;orry for it, ina&s;much as all this general Expectation will doubtle&s;s be di&s;appointed. Any Thing that bears the Appearance of a Chapter of Contents I utterly explode, and for very &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons too: which Rea&s;ons are not &s;ub&s;tantial merely becau&s;e I chu&s;e to think them &s;o,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
but are really, and in them&s;elves, <HI>Seip&s;is,</HI> Rea&s;ons good and &s;ub&s;tan|tial; as I will pre&s;ently prove, all the Rules of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and the An|cients, with their Prologu&s;&s;es and Choru&s;&s;es, and Prota&s;i&s;&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c. notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In their Dramatic Exhibitions and Theatres-Royal indeed, (pre|&s;uppo&s;ing that their Regulations concerning Box-keepers, and no Money to be returned after the Curtain is drawn up, were the &s;ame as ours,) all the&s;e Pieces of Infor|mation might do well enough per|haps; for the Five Shillings being once paid, it &s;ignified little to the Author or Manager, though it might contribute &s;omewhat to in|crea&s;e the <HI>Ennui</HI> of the Auditor; whether one was let into the Plot
<PB N="9" REF="11">
of &s;omething exceedingly &s;tupid, plump&mdash;all at once, or was left to fi&s;h it out by Degrees, as the Play proceeded, <HI>Gradatim et Pede|tentim.</HI> But in the Ca&s;e of a mo|dern Novel, it is widely different. For, &s;uppo&s;ing that is explained in the Preface; Mi&s;s &s;ends for it after Breakfa&s;t, &s;kims the &s;ix or eight fir&s;t Pages without cutting open the Leaves, and if, from Want of Ta&s;te or Di&s;cernment, (for we can|not &s;uppo&s;e the Author in fault,) &s;he happens to di&s;like either all the Characters, or any one of them; the general Plan of the Whole; the Beginning, the Middle, or the Cata&s;trophe; it is returned imme|diately to her Book&s;eller with the verbal Satisfaction ari&s;ing from her informing him, that <Q>She was
<PB N="10" REF="12">
very &s;orry for the Trouble &s;he had given him, but that her Ser|vant had made a Mi&s;take, that it was the wrong Book, 'twas not the Book &s;he wanted,</Q> or the like futile Apology; and there is &s;o much clear Lo&s;s out of the Author's and Book&s;eller's Pocket. Now, if on the other Hand, &s;he is obliged to read the Book through to come at the Contents of it, &s;he mu&s;t cut open the Leaves; if &s;he cuts open the Leaves, &s;he is obliged to pay for the Book; and if &s;he is obliged to pay for the Book, there is &s;o much clear gain into the Author's and Book&s;eller's Pocket. Be&s;ides, &s;he will then find Entertainment in it; for the Goad of Curio&s;ity, (which in the other Ca&s;e is entirely taken away,) now acting upon her, every
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Thing is &s;een through a different Medium: Den&s;e Sayings become rare; dull, brilliant; and &s;he now gets thro' with the utmo&s;t Satis|faction, what would otherwi&s;e have &s;eemed as tire&s;ome and fatiguing, had &s;he been condemned to read it, as lulling her Father to &s;leep with the P&s;alms and Le&s;&s;ons on a Sunday Evening.</P>
<P>All I &s;hall &s;ay therefore, is, that I take Characters as I find them; &s;o that if there are any Objections made on that Score, as that they are unnatural, di&s;agreeable, or the like; the Charge will all lie at their own Doors, and I, being but an humble Copier, wa&s;h my Hands of it. Thus much, however, I freely declare, to avoid the Grumb|lings and Ill-will of &s;uch as e&s;ti|mate
<PB N="12" REF="14">
the Value of a Novel by the Number of Peers and Counte&s;&s;es it contains; that from the Begin|ning to the End of my Book, they will find neither a Duke of B&mdash;, nor a Marquis of C&mdash;, nor D&mdash;, nor any one Member of the Upper-hou&s;e what&s;oever; no, not even in Di&s;gui&s;e. A mere &s;im|ple Baronet or two, and tho&s;e but odd ones, are my mo&s;t dignified Male Characters; and as to my Females, they are all&mdash;<HI>Common.</HI> Neither do I think I have any Thing exactly adapted to the Pa|lates of tho&s;e blood-thir&s;ty Gentle|women who delight in Duels be|tween Lovers, and &s;hooting High|waymen, and the like Sorts of En|tertainment: for though we have one Military Man among&s;t us, he
<PB N="13" REF="15">
is not particularly attached to &s;uch barbarous Pa&s;times, owing perhaps to the Scenes of Slaughter he has been pre&s;ent at in <HI>America,</HI> which he has quitted but ju&s;t Time enough to give me a little A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. I feel indeed, (and &s;urely I may be permitted to flatter my&s;elf that in this Affair at lea&s;t I can &s;ee as far into Futurity as any other blind <HI>Tire&s;ias,</HI>) a certain unac|countable <HI>Pre&s;entiment</HI> that &s;ome of my Characters, being naturally turbulent, will fall out and quar|rel among&s;t them&s;elves before I have done with them, in &s;pite of all my Endeavours to the contrary. Le&s;t this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e how|ever, I here beg Leave to premi&s;e, as before in the Article of Di&s;|agreeablene&s;s, that it is all their
<PB N="14" REF="16">
own doing; and if the Con&s;e|quences by any Accident &s;hould be &s;anguinary, it will be entirely for their own Amu&s;ement and Satis|faction. For my Part, I am too much of a Chri&s;tian not to join in the Litany with the utmo&s;t Fervour and Sincerity, for Deliverance <Q>from all Battle and Murder, and from &s;udden Death.</Q></P>
<P>As to my Sentimental Readers, if any &s;uch there &s;hould be; for them indeed I have procured a very va|luable, curious, and intere&s;ting Manu&s;cript. It was given me by an intimate Friend of mine, who met with it by Accident; and though it is written by no higher Character than a Lady's Maid, I think I may venture to pronounce it very far from contemptible. I
<PB N="15" REF="17">
declare, moreover, as an additional Gratification, that if any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons of this Stamp &s;hould perceive their Patience fail them in coming at it in the regular Cour&s;e of Read|ing; I will &s;ave &s;uch the Trouble of &s;pitting on their Thumbs to turn the Leaves over, by informing them that it is to be found &s;ome|where towards the latter End of this fir&s;t Volume, I forget exactly the Number of the Page. And now, having given People in gene|ral, as much Satisfaction as I think proper, I mean to fill the Re|mainder of my Preface with a Di&s;&s;ertation on a Greek Verb and a Compound Pronoun.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>No&s;ce Teip&s;um,</HI> or Know Thy&s;elf, as it has been differently rendered in the different
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Languages, was the Saying of an old <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;opher, who&s;e Name I know nothing about. Now, though that Maxim might be a very good one, and highly &s;erviceable in tho&s;e Days, when it was the Fa&s;hion for Men to run away from their Relations, lo&s;e them&s;elves in &s;ome great Wood, (of Science I mean,) and letting their Beards grow, commence Brutes or Philo&s;ophers, or &s;ome|times both, ju&s;t as it happened; yet I cannot help entertaining a very different Opinion of its Ex|cellency when applied to our pre|&s;ent Sy&s;tem of Things. I pre&s;ume it is granted, that nothing is more fickle than Fa&s;hion, or more &s;ubject to an infinite Variety of Changes. That at one Time we
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;ee every Body with Wai&s;ts as high as their Arm-pits, and Skirts hang|ing as long and as aukwardly from the Shoulder, "as an old Lady's loo&s;e Gown." By and by, the Wai&s;t is dropt to the Kneeband, and the Skirts and Pockets look like tho&s;e of a Town Footman's Powdering Jacket, or the Remains of a tall Rogue's Thieving Coat, that had left eight or ten Inches of its length in a Nur&s;ery-Man's Steel-Trap. One Minute, nobody can appear with a Button bigger than a drop Ear-ring, or the End of a young Toad&s;tool; the next, nothing but Plates and Pot-lids go down; and if &s;ome odd Fellow by Accident appears in a Suit of Cloaths fifty Years behind hand, he is con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely <HI>Antediluvian</HI> and <HI>Hot|tentotti&s;h.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
And is there not then a Fa&s;hion in quaint Sayings and pithy Apopthegms as well as in Dre&s;s? Would not that be looked upon as gro&s;s Bawdry, and an Affront to the Company where it was &s;poken, in the&s;e cha&s;te Days of original Purity, which would have been con&s;idered as a very good Joke in <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Time, even for a Maid of Honour to have laughed at? And this being the Ca&s;e, can any thing be more ab&s;urd and ridiculous than to &s;ee Men now-a-days (fol|lowing that old Piece of Advice of two or three Thou&s;and Years &s;tand|ing,) lock them&s;elves up in their Libraries, (for in the Woods they would probably be expo&s;ed to the Exerci&s;e of being hunted at pre|&s;ent, or might be pa&s;&s;ed to their
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Pari&s;hes, or &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction as Vagrants, or &s;entenced to Balla&s;t-heaving as Thieves, or to Bedlam as Mad-men, or to <HI>Brooks's</HI> in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> as Porcupine-Men; or fifty other Ac|cidents might happen, which would bur&s;t the Barriers of my Parenthe&s;is, if I attempted to in&s;ert them,) and taking the <HI>No&s;ce Teip&s;um</HI> in an ex|clu&s;ive Sen&s;e, determine to know nobody <HI>but</HI> them&s;elves; &s;o that if their Ceiling happens to fall in, or they are burnt out of their Labo|ratory, or any extraordinary Event of that Sort drives them into the World; they &s;tare about them, and &s;tart, and run to hide them&s;elves in the fir&s;t Hole they can meet with, like a Spider that's poked out of his Cobweb. Be&s;ides, if
<PB N="20" REF="22">
they are &s;o ob&s;tinately bigotted to this old Saying, let them follow it according to the new Tran&s;lation, which is &s;till highly fa&s;hionable, and is now generally believed to be the right one. All the Grammars that I ever read, conjugate the fir&s;t Per|&s;on &s;ingular of Verbs Active in the following Manner. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for In&s;tance, the Verb, <HI>KNOW,</HI> and let us &s;uppo&s;e the old <HI>Grecian</HI> delivering his Precept to me with a grave Face and dirty Beard, in Engli&s;h, (for I will not make any farther Di&s;play of my Greek and Latin Knowledge, for fear of Puz|zling my Readers,) <HI>"Know Thy|&s;elf."</HI> I begin to conjugate, (hav|ing fir&s;t turned my Eyes inwards a little, to &s;ee whether his Advice was nece&s;&s;ary,) Indicative Mood,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
fir&s;t Per&s;on &s;ingular, <HI>I know, am knowing, or</HI> &mdash; and the Thing is done.

<P>In tho&s;e ancient Times, indeed, when Men never felt them&s;elves Ea&s;y without two or three hundred Weight of Iron or Bra&s;s upon their Shoulders; when their Fingers were always itching to cut one another's Throats for Diver&s;ion; when their Kings and Generals were for ever vapouring and flouri&s;hing their

Swords about, like a Parcel of Children, in&s;omuch that if we may believe <HI>Homer,</HI> they would &s;ometimes kill their own Butchers-meat to keep their Hands in: When all this was the Ca&s;e I &s;ay, a quiet peaceable Man, who would at any Time rather fall to &s;leep than to fighting, might be much in the Right, taking the Saying in its old Acceptation, to run away and hide him&s;elf. But in the&s;e Days of Tranquillity and Civilization, when nothing of this Kind is to be feared; when People generally take off their Swords before they &s;it down to Dinner; when the Excellency of our <HI>Police</HI> is &s;uch, that a Man may walk for a Fortnight together about the Streets and Roads of the Metropolis, as &s;afely as in his own

<P>O Learning! thou fair maturing Sun of Genius! without who&s;e fo&s;tering Influence it &s;hoots and flouri&s;hes indeed, but brings no Fruit to Perfection: How is thy Cau&s;e injured by the churli&s;h Bi|gotry of thy Profe&s;&s;ors! How

<PB N="29" REF="30">
finding Reality too &s;trong for Ima|gination, I began &s;eriou&s;ly to ru|minate upon what had pa&s;&s;ed dur|ing the Interval. My la&s;t Letter I think was written ju&s;t before I &s;et out on my Expedition to that Centre of Gaiety, <HI>Bath;</HI> and I have not heard from you the&s;e two Months.

I will not attempt a De&s;cription of her, as every Man is apt to deal in Hy|perbole on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, and talk of Orange-flower Breath, and Pearls and Rubies, (as if he was thinking of the Trinkets that mu&s;t

that the young Lady was his Daughter and only Child, that &s;he was &s;aid to have a very large For|tune, and finally, was to be at the Ball next Evening. A lucky Gleam of Recollection at this In&s;tant re|minded me that I had often heard my Father talk of him, and that, when a Child, I had &s;een him at our Hou&s;e. Upon the Strength of this paternal Acquaintance, I de|termined to introduce my&s;elf, and accordingly made my Appearance at his Door the next Morning about Breakfa&s;t Time. I found the old Gentleman in his Night-cap and Slippers, pothering over the News|paper, and his <HI>Charmante fille</HI> on the oppo&s;ite Side of the Table, pouring out the Tea. Having &s;eated my&s;elf by him, both that I

might have a more advantageous View of my Godde&s;s, and that I might appear to pay him the greater Re&s;pect, I began to explain who I was; and having mentioned &s;ome Circum&s;tances which I luckily re|membered to have heard from my Father concerning their Acquain|tance together, the old Gentleman whipt off his Spectacles in an In|&s;tant, and laying down his Paper, fir&s;t &s;hook me heartily by the Hand, and immediately afterwards re&s;uming the former Part of his Apparatus, &s;tared me full in the Face for near a Minute to di&s;cover whether there was any Family Likene&s;s. He was fortunate enough to perceive a very &s;trong one, which was more than ever I have been able to do in my Life, However,

it &s;erved to increa&s;e his Civility to me, and we &s;oon became very inti|mate. His Wife it &s;eems has been dead &s;everal Years, and he calls his own Age between Sixty and Seven|ty, tho' the frequent Gouty At|tacks he has undergone, make him look older. He talked over a va&s;t Heap of Family Matters, and &s;eemed to con&s;ider me as an Ac|quaintance of twenty Years &s;tand|ing. Thanks to my Father for it! In the mean Time his Daughter was not idle. I burnt my Mouth horribly with a &s;calding Di&s;h of Tea &s;he pre&s;ented me, from paying greater Attention to the Giver than the Gift. She frequently joined in our Di&s;cour&s;e, and was full of Life and Vivacity. You may &s;up|po&s;e I exerted my&s;elf, and as a

I now &s;it down to fulfil that Promi&s;e, and at the &s;ame Time to a&s;k your Advice in regard to my future Mea&s;ures. Really, I am very much in love with this Girl. The more I think of her, the more I admire her good Sen&s;e and Viva|city; and though in Ca&s;e of a Refu&s;al, I &s;hould neither &s;hoot nor

drown, yet if I ever am to marry, mo&s;t fervently do I pray that &s;he may be the Per&s;on.

To return to my Hi&s;tory. According to Appointment, I was made happy with Mi&s;s <HI>Hartley</HI>'s Hand at the Ball, and before &s;he quitted <HI>Bath,</HI> became perfectly intimate with her Father, and I flatter my&s;elf, not utterly di&s;agree|able to her&s;elf.

which however is an innocent one, and in &s;ome Degree hereditary. His Father was a Man, who to good natural Parts, had added a con&s;iderable Fund of acquired Knowledge: He, &s;eeing with the Eyes of a Parent, unluckily &s;up|po&s;es this Son po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame Degree of the one, and con&s;equent|ly determines he &s;hall not be defi|cient in the other. With this View he is &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity, and both his Terms and Vacations employed in all the Perplexities of Science either with his Tutor, or at Home. By and by, the old Man dies; and the Son, having always been taught to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf clever, takes his Father's Word for the Truth of it, and

<P>Really, the whole &s;eems like a Dream to me, and I &s;hall not be thoroughly awake again, till I get back into the Country. To begin with our own Sex, as we certainly claim the Preference in every Thing, "The human Face divine," which was wont to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome Share of Pre-eminence, and with its natural

Mr. <HI>Melmoth,</HI> for to call him Hu&s;band, would be utterly Gothic, keeps a Chair for me to vi&s;it in, but I fear
<PB N="64" REF="65">
I mu&s;t &s;oon put him to the Expence of another, as I find it morally im|po&s;&s;ible to move about in the &s;ame Vehicle with my Head-dre&s;s, which I de&s;ign to be preceded by in future, as the Knights were by their Hel|met, in Days of Chivalry. Nor are the Men one whit behind us in Point of Extravagance and Ab&s;ur|dity.

To compen&s;ate however for this Extravagance, their Wai&s;tcoats are generally laced, like a Woman's Stays, and without any Buttons at all. Then nobody can &s;tir without two Watches, (&s;o that a Man need

never be at a Lo&s;s to know how much Time he wa&s;tes,) and the&s;e decorated with enormous Gold Chains, and as many Seals and Trinkets as would furni&s;h a Jew Pedlar's Travelling-Box. As for the Article of Buckles, their Size may perhaps render them extremely &s;er|viceable as Bridges in cro&s;&s;ing over a Kennel, but for their Beauty I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed. A few Nights &s;ince I went to <HI>Stevens</HI>'s Lecture upon Heads, and was not a little entertained. He ridicules all the fa&s;hionable Ab&s;urdities mo&s;t excellently.

<SALUTE>My dear old Friend Sir Anthony,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING now been in <HI>London</HI> for &s;ome Weeks, for you know I have been here ever &s;ince I left <HI>Staples,</HI> I begin to think of writing to you, to inquire after your Health, and to mention &s;uch Circum&s;tances as may have be|fallen me &s;ince our la&s;t Meeting. It has always been my earne&s;t Wi&s;h and De&s;ire, as you certainly mu&s;t well remember, I having frequently
<PB N="71" REF="72">
opened my&s;elf on this Subject to you, to procure for my Daughter a Man of deep Literature, of pro|found and &s;cientific Erudition, as an Hu&s;band. Learning, &s;ays the Proverb, is better than Hou&s;e and Land,
<Q><L>For when Hou&s;e and Land are gone and &s;pent,</L>
<L>Then Learning is mo&s;t excellent.</L></Q>
and indeed I do not know how I &s;hould have weathered my Way through &s;o many Years as I have done, without it. My Daughter is fond of gadding about and rack|etting at Public Places at pre&s;ent 'tis true, but I don't doubt, if I can meet with &s;uch an Hu&s;band for her, &s;he will be quite another Thing, and then &s;he may learn Logic and Mathematics and Greek;
<PB N="72" REF="73">
and that will be an everla&s;ting Fund of Amu&s;ement, even though they &s;hould live all the Year in the Country. I do not much care about the Matter of Fortune in my Choice. That will be no Object with me. She is my only Child, and I have enough for both of them. But to come to the Point. Do you know, my good old Friend, I really think I have found the Man I could wi&s;h for. This very Evening I was drinking Tea at Mrs. <HI>Cypher</HI>'s, when, among&s;t other Que&s;tions, enquiring after her Son who is of the Univer&s;ity; &s;he told that he was gone upon a Vi&s;it to her Brother for a few Days, that he was but ju&s;t come up from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and had with much Diffi|culty brought his Tutor Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="74">
with him, a Gentleman of about thirty Years of Age, and who was reputed one of the clevere&s;t, mo&s;t learned, mo&s;t agreeable Men in the Univer&s;ity: but added &s;he with a Sneer, he has kept it all to him|&s;elf as yet; for though he has been here three Days, he has not ad|vanced farther than Negatives and Affirmatives in his Di&s;cour&s;e: However, you will &s;ee him pre|&s;ently. The&s;e Words were &s;carce out of her Mouth, before the Door opened &s;oftly, and in came Mr. <HI>Pedant.</HI> I ro&s;e from my Chair as he approached, in which he im|mediately &s;eated him&s;elf, without uttering a Word. I mu&s;t own I thought this a little odd; but learned Men will have their Oddi|ties: So I drew another, and began
<PB N="74" REF="75">
entering into a Di&s;cour&s;e with him. Whil&s;t I confined my&s;elf to the Politics and Public Amu&s;ements of our Country, I cannot &s;ay that I found him very Communicative. This is certainly a Mark of Wi&s;dom and Erudition! But when at la&s;t I touched upon the Manners of the Ancients, and the Difference between the Policy of tho&s;e Times and our own, I perceived his Chair &s;liding gradually nearer and nearer to me, bringing him&s;elf along with it, with his Eyes fixed earne&s;tly on the Fender. Pre&s;ently he turned his Face towards me, and in a half Whi&s;per, that the Re&s;t of the Company might not hear our Di&s;|cour&s;e, began with the Wrath of <HI>Achilles</HI> in a dozen Lines from <HI>Homer,</HI> and before we parted, which
<PB N="75" REF="76">
was not till near ten o'Clock, had given me a very compleat Epitome of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Hi&s;tory, inter&s;per&s;ed with excellent Remarks and Greek Quotations from <HI>Herodotus, Thucy|dides,</HI> &amp;c. which, though I did not under&s;tand all of them, and cannot &s;ay I ab&s;olutely remember any, yet neverthele&s;s gave me an infinite Degree of Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction. In &s;hort, my old Friend, you may &s;uppo&s;e I was quite enraptured, and immediately invited him to Breakfa&s;t with me the next Morning, to which he at fir&s;t appeared to a&s;&s;ent very readily, but when I mentioned my having a Daughter at Home who was young and hand&s;ome, he &s;eemed much di&s;turbed, and would fain have pretended an ab&s;olute Obligation
<PB N="76" REF="77">
to return directly to <HI>Oxford.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he began to &s;u&s;pect my Intentions upon him, and thought his Time too precious to be wa&s;ted in the Company of Women. In|deed I in &s;ome Degree intimated my Wi&s;hes for &s;uch a Son-in-law, which might give him &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for his Di&s;tru&s;t. However, I would not let him off. So I hur|ried Home, and having acquainted my Daughter with the happy Pro&s;|pect &s;he had of &s;uch a Hu&s;band, and ordered her to prepare to re|ceive him, I could not help &s;itting down in&s;tantly to inform you of it, and, as I fear the Po&s;t is gone out, will &s;end it by the early Stage to|morrow tied up like a Parcel, that you may receive this happy Intelli|gence as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>O My dear Girl, what &s;trange Things I have to tell you! Such a Creature, &s;uch a Lump of Learning has my Father picked out for my Hu&s;band! You know his ab&s;urd Bigotry that way. But I will &s;cribble down the whole Tran&s;|action. La&s;t Night, my Dear, as I was ju&s;t returned from two Routs, and going to Dre&s;s for the <HI>Pantheon</HI> Ma&s;querade; half awake, half a&s;leep, &s;itting on a Sopha; in twenty Minds whether I &s;hould go, or &s;end an Excu&s;e to my Party; half eat up with the Spleen, the Vapours,
<PB N="79" REF="80">
and that Kind of <HI>Ennuyant</HI> No|thing-to-do-i&s;hne&s;s which is wor&s;e than all the Re&s;t:&mdash;The Door flew open, and in hurried my Father, as fa&s;t as ever two Sticks and a Pair of gouty Legs could carry him. "My Dear Child," &s;ays he, "make your&s;elf happy! Your utmo&s;t Wi&s;hes will be &s;atisfied!" So, thought I, what the Deuce is in the Wind now. "My Dear Sir," &s;ays I, turning round to him, "what have you done? Have you got me a Ticket for Lady <HI>Racket</HI>'s Private Concert." "Concert," quoth he, "No, my Dear, I have at la&s;t found out an Hu&s;band for you. I met him this Night at Mrs. <HI>Cypher</HI>'s, and have prevailed on him to Break|fa&s;t here to-morrow and pay you a Vi&s;it." Well, thought I, this mu&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="81">
be a curious Creature indeed, if it is of your chu&s;ing. "He is rather &s;ilent to be &s;ure," added he, "but you mu&s;t talk to him. I'm &s;ure he is very learned."</P>
<P>After a little more Di&s;cour&s;e of this Sort, and five hundred Enco|miums pa&s;&s;ed upon Mr. <HI>Pedant,</HI> for that is his Name; off he went to Bed; and for my&s;elf, my Mind was too much engaged with the Drollery of the Adventure, to &s;uf|fer my going out that Night. So I rang my Bell, and went to Bed al&s;o; dreamt all Night of nothing but Bookworms and Conjurers, and at la&s;t waked in an horrible Fright with the Idea that I was almo&s;t &s;queezed to death by a great Dictionary, that had fallen upon me from the Top of a Cupboard.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82">In Proce&s;s of Time, as old &s;tory Books &s;ay, Morning arrived, which I had through mere Curio&s;ity been longing for during the la&s;t three Hours, almo&s;t as much as if I had been to &s;ee&mdash;any Body you chu&s;e to gue&s;s at. Between ten and eleven, having waited &s;ome Time for Mr. <HI>Pedant,</HI> we &s;at down to Breakfa&s;t; and ju&s;t as the &s;econd Di&s;h was poured out, a double Knock pro|claimed his Arrival. The Room Door opened, and in about half a Minute my Lover appeared. His Method of Approach was to be &s;ure &s;omewhat &s;ingular. Whil&s;t the Door &s;erved him for a Screen, his Advance was &s;ideways, &s;omewhat in the Stile of a Crab, with his Face clo&s;e towards it. This was followed by a &s;udden Evolution
<PB N="82" REF="83">
upon the Heel to &s;hut it after him; in which Situation he remained near a Minute, exhibiting one of the mo&s;t ridiculous Back Fronts I ever beheld. At la&s;t, having at|chieved this important Bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;uffered us to take a Peep at his Face, through the Medium of a dirty Pocket-Handkerchief, which he had whipt up to his No&s;e at the In&s;tant he turned towards us; but never was any awkward School-boy, when he comes home for the Holidays, and finds his Mother in a Circle of Company, half &s;o <HI>gauche</HI> or <HI>decontenanc&eacute;.</HI> His Feet &s;eemed fixed to the Ground at the awful Appearance of your humble Ser|vant. Really, I never thought my|&s;elf quite &s;o terrible before. By and by he advanced, with the left Hand
<PB N="83" REF="84">
fumbling in his Pocket, as if he had lo&s;t Something, and the other holding fa&s;t by the lower Button of his Coat: but as Ill-luck would have it, he had &s;carce proceeded three Steps, when as he was gap|ing about for a Place to lay his Hat, and a Chair to &s;it down on, the &s;ublime Maje&s;ty of my Pre|&s;ence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Corner of the Carpet, (according to the Doctrine of &s;econd Cau&s;es) which his Foot happened to catch in, &s;o &s;taggered him, that down he pro&s;trated at my Feet, like a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> before the Sun. Poor Man! I thought he had been in a Fit at fir&s;t! Should not you, my Dear? So I ran up to him, and dropping upon one Knee, "My dear Mr. <HI>Pedant,</HI> this is Adoration indeed! Nothing Apoplectic? No|thing
<PB N="84" REF="85">
of the Dead Pal&s;y &s;ure? You are not hurt, I hope?" "No, he was not," he &s;aid with an Air &s;ufficiently inelegant; and at the &s;ame In&s;tant ri&s;ing with all the Hurry of Awkwardne&s;s, (not &s;o nimbly however, but that he contrived to tear my Apron and cru&s;h my Father's gouty Toe in his Recovery,) he &s;quatted in the fir&s;t Chair he came to, which happened to be mine, and &s;liding one Leg &s;oftly over the other, fixed his Eyes upon his Shoe with a Look of Contempla|tion, which I believe would have continued till this Time, if nobody had di&s;turbed him. Well, nothing is &s;o odious as to &s;ee a Man in a brown Study, or what is &s;till wor&s;e, picking his Thumbs, and buttoning and unbuttoning his
<PB N="85" REF="86">
Wai&s;tcoat like a City Taylor trying an ill-made Suit of Cloaths on. In this Attitude, however, did he contrive to drink a Di&s;h of Tea which I carried him, and to eat two or three Pieces of Bread and Butter. As &s;oon as the Breakfa&s;t Things were taken away, my Fa|ther, that he might not &s;poil Court&s;hip, ro&s;e to leave the Room. His poor Companion, though he had all the Dread of altering his Po&s;ition as &s;trong upon him as ever, could not re&s;i&s;t the Attraction; but ab&s;olutely varied his Attitude, and &s;tealing his Head over his Shoulder by Degrees, like a Boy that is afraid of an Apparition after he has been hearing fright|ful Stories, eyed him wi&s;hfully to
<PB N="86" REF="87">
the Door, and if <HI>mauvai&s;e honte</HI> had not for once &s;tood his Friend, would I dare &s;ay have given up all his Stock of Politene&s;s to have fol|lowed him.</P>
<Q>He ca&s;t one longing lingering Look behind.</Q>
<P>We were now left to our&s;elves. I, in that odd Kind of dubious Humour which a Woman feels when &s;he is in half a Dozen Minds whether to be cro&s;s or not, found my&s;elf mon&s;trou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed for a little ill-natured Raillery; whil&s;t my Swain, &s;o far from langui&s;hing with all the Ardour of an expiring Inamorato, or opening his unhap|py Ca&s;e with a Sigh of De&s;pond|ency, endeavoured to entertain him&s;elf as afore&s;aid, by &s;queezing
<PB N="87" REF="88">
and twi&s;ting his Fingers, and di&s;|torting his Countenance, like a &s;tarved Frog in a Fit of the Cholic.</P>
<P>True Love, they &s;ay, is always accompanied with Fear. It de|prives the mo&s;t Eloquent of the Powers of Speech, embarra&s;&s;es the ea&s;y and polite Man, and in &s;hort turns the whole human Sy&s;tem top&s;y turvey. If this be true, and if it be true likewi&s;e, that Mr. <HI>Pe|dant</HI> is a polite and agreeable Man, as my Father tells me, he mu&s;t be mo&s;t de&s;perately &s;mitten indeed, and I fear, poor Fellow, from the little Encouragement he is likely to receive from me, will very &s;oon put an End to him&s;elf; or re&s;ume his Sciences, which I believe will
<PB N="88" REF="89">
be much the &s;ame Thing to the World in general.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, for two whole Hours I tormented him with a con|tinued String of Common-place Chit-chat and every day Que&s;tions, in which I was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the two Mi&s;s <HI>Yaffles,</HI> who acci|dentally dropt in upon me. I abu&s;ed the Cut of his Coat, in|formed him his Wai&s;tcoat was too long in the Pockets, and enquired whether his Taylor was a <HI>French|man.</HI> I a&s;ked him how he liked the new <HI>Opera,</HI> whether he was at the <HI>Pantheon</HI> la&s;t <HI>Monday,</HI> and told him I heard that he was a Pro|prietor of <HI>Ranelagh.</HI> When I flag|ged for a Minute, my Companions opened upon him, and kept up an ince&s;&s;ant Annoyance, which he en|dured
<PB N="89" REF="90">
not &s;o much from Patience, I believe, as from the Horrors of making a Bow if he left us. At la&s;t a polite Thundering at the Door, like an additional Broad&s;ide, deter|mined him; and con&s;idering that if he did not depart immediately, the Enemy would receive a Rein|forcement, he jumped up from his Chair in an In&s;tant, and retreated like the <HI>American</HI> Army in a Ga|zette, with the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Alas, poor <HI>Ea&s;y!</HI> thou art igno|rant what a dangerous Rival op|po&s;es thee! But I do not think you will remain long &s;o, if it is in mine or my Father's Power to ac|quaint you with it. Here is the State of the Ca&s;e. An agreeable young Fellow introduces him&s;elf to
<PB N="90" REF="91">
my Father at <HI>Bath,</HI> and by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of quick Parts, and a long Cock-and-Bull Story, works him|&s;elf completely into his good Graces. Soon after it is thought nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould be married, and for this Purpo&s;e my wi&s;e Pa|rent picks out, as I verily believe, one of the awkwarde&s;t Boobies in the whole Kingdom of <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> for his Daughter to pay her Addre&s;&s;es to. However, a Confi|dant is thought requi&s;ite to talk Matters over with, and now of all the Birds in the Air, who would you &s;uppo&s;e the quick-&s;ighted old Gentleman pitches upon, but this very agreeable young Fellow, this identical <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> who&s;e Attachment to this very Daughter of his, if he
<PB N="91" REF="92">
had had the Sight of a Mole, he mu&s;t have di&s;covered over and over again, before this Time.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Con|fidant, I gathered from &s;ome Hints he dropped to-day; for &s;o much is his Mind occupied between his own Plan of Operations, and his Inve&s;tigation of what perhaps ne|ver happened among the Anci|ents; that no Po&s;&s;ibility ever enters his Head of the Enemy's being employed in counteracting him. If I don't &s;ee the dear Fel|low in a Day or two, I'll write to him however, that he may be prepared to receive this great Tru&s;t and Secret with due Com|po&s;ure of Countenance.

<P>Well, my dear Friend, do you think you &s;hould know this Rival from the De&s;cription I have given; and do you think there is much to be feared from him, all Circum|&s;tances con&s;idered? Mi&s;s <HI>Hartley</HI>

laughs at him, and tormented him &s;o completely the la&s;t Vi&s;it he made her, which by the Bye was the fir&s;t, and that owing to her Father's pre&s;&s;ing Invitation, that I &s;u&s;pect he will &s;oon fly off in a Tangent, and have nothing farther to &s;ay to her. But now for the Means by which I gained all this Knowledge. This whole Day has been &s;pent with old <HI>Hartley.</HI> As &s;oon as we were left to our&s;elves after Dinner, he began with Mr. <HI>Pedant,</HI> and in about half an Hour unfolded his Plan of Operations to me as com|pletely as I could have wi&s;hed&punc; concluding with de&s;iring my A&s;|&s;i&s;tance as Confidant. That before he left <HI>London,</HI> which would not be till the End of <HI>July,</HI> he meant
<PB N="100" REF="101">
to vi&s;it <HI>Oxford,</HI> whither he hoped I would accompany him, and that he &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible, prevail upon <HI>Pedant</HI> to &s;pend &s;ome Time with him in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire.</HI> During this Di&s;cour&s;e, you may gue&s;s I was in a mo&s;t ridiculous Situation. However, I &s;mothered my A&s;ton|i&s;hment tolerably well, and entirely acquie&s;ced in every Thing; pre|tending to approve his Plan highly. After Tea, the old Gentleman took a Nap, and con&s;equently gave me the Opportunity of a charming <HI>T&ecirc;te &agrave; T&ecirc;te</HI> with <HI>my Kitty,</HI> (as I hope &s;he will be.) which I believe did not much promote Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI>'s Intere&s;t.

<P>IF you find any Thing abrupt or unconnected in this &s;econd Part of my Letter, you mu&s;t at|tribute it to the ridiculous Manner in which I was waked this Morn|ing. Between &s;even and eight o'Clock, an Hour when you know nobody is &s;tirring in <HI>London</HI> except Du&s;tmen and Chimney-&s;weepers, with here and there an accidental Milkmaid, or a Carriage returning from the Ma&s;querade; I was rou&s;ed from a very &s;ound Sleep by a vi|olent and ince&s;&s;ant Thundering at my Door. By the Time I had
<PB N="103" REF="104">
opened my Eyes, and turned about to &s;ee what was the Matter; I di&s;|covered the Author of all this Riot, who had forced his Way in, and was &s;tanding by my Bed-&s;ide. He was a very &s;habby looking Fel|low, about the middle Size, with an old ru&s;ty Hat flapped over his Face, a threadbare Coat of coar&s;e blue Ker&s;ey, clo&s;e buttoned, and in his Hand a very inimical Oak Staff of at lea&s;t two Inches diame|ter. For &s;ome Time I was in doubt whether to con&s;ider him as a Thief, Thief-taker, or Bailiff; three Characters I am exceedingly aver&s;e to being connected with; and &s;hould probably have laboured much longer under this Uncer|tainty, had I not recognized the Voice of our old Friend and
<PB N="104" REF="105">
Schoolfellow, Sir <HI>Thorobred Rugg,</HI> who arrived in <HI>England</HI> about three Days before, and now made his Appearance with the Intention of breakfa&s;ting with me. Whil&s;t I was dre&s;&s;ing, he entertained me with the Detail of &s;ome of his <HI>Holland</HI> Exploits. How he had terrified two <HI>Jew</HI> Merchants into a Fit of Illne&s;s, by committing the dark Deed of Nature on their Sab|bath, with a mad <HI>Dutchwoman</HI> under a Hedge, whom he gave a Schelling for her Trouble, and had his Pocket picked into the Bargain. How he had got drunk about a Week before he left the <HI>Hague,</HI> and had thrown two Clappermen into one of the Canals, having fir&s;t packed them up carefully in a Couple of four-dozen Hampers.
<PB N="105" REF="106">
And finally, how he had been ram|bling half over <HI>London</HI> la&s;t Night. with his two Friends, <HI>Jack Surcin|gle</HI> and <HI>Tom Fetlock,</HI> whom he had met by Accident at the <HI>Piazza</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e. How they had all been to a great Fire that had hap|pened &s;omewhere or other, though he had forgot where: that he had ran up one of the Ladders, and brought down a Woman and Child from a two pair of Stairs Room that was burning; had drank Purl with the Firemen; and as he was coming home, had got into an empty Watch-box, and made a one-eyed Watchman take to his Heels, and drop his Staff and Lan|tern, by jumping out upon him and crying boh! as he was return|ing to his Stand from the Ale-hou&s;e;
<PB N="106" REF="107">
and how he had hung up another to the Hooks of a Butcher's Shambles by the Wai&s;tband of his Breeches.</P>
<P>By the Time the&s;e Hi&s;tories were fini&s;hed, I was dre&s;&s;ed and ready for Breakfa&s;t; when ju&s;t as the fir&s;t Di&s;h of Tea was poured out, he recollected that his Face had not been wa&s;hed &s;ince his Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> and ran immediately to my wa&s;hing Stand. This how|ever did not an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e, as the Ba&s;on, which I had ju&s;t been u&s;ing, was not emptied. That it was po&s;&s;ible to throw its Contents out of the Window, and fill it with clean Water, never once occurred to him, if one may judge from the Method he &s;ub&s;tituted; which was no other than dipping the Corner
<PB N="107" REF="108">
of the Breakfa&s;t Cloth into his Tea-cup, and wiping him&s;elf with his dirty Pocket Handkerchief. My Breakfa&s;t and his Ablution be|ing fini&s;hed, he turned his Face to|wards the Looking-gla&s;s, and un|luckily di&s;covered that &s;having al&s;o was in &s;ome Degree proper, as he was engaged out to Dinner. So all nece&s;&s;ary Implements being pro|duced for the Purpo&s;e, he began his Operation; but had &s;carcely cleared one Side of his Counte|nance, when the injudicious Mo|tion of the under Jaw, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;udden Remark he was about to make, laid the Razor a full half Inch into his Cheek. Blood followed pretty plentifully as you may imagine: This how|ever being &s;taunched by &s;craping
<PB N="108" REF="109">
from his Hat the &s;mall Quantity of Nap that remained there, and applying to the Wound; he de|termined to avoid ri&s;quing a &s;econd Inci&s;ion, by leaving the other Side of his Face untouched; and hav|ing &s;taid with me about an Hour longer, he &s;allied out to pay a few more Morning Vi&s;its, and from thence to the Hou&s;e whither he was engaged to Dinner.</P>
<P>If ever Man had Preten&s;ions to Originality, &s;urely this has! and yet with all his Oddities and Foi|bles, one cannot help liking him. He is, I really think, a very wor|thy Fellow at Bottom, and has a good Heart. Old <HI>Thi&s;tleberry,</HI> the Par&s;on of his Pari&s;h in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> is dead lately, and he means to pre|&s;ent <HI>Tom Fetlock,</HI> who is in Or|ders,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
to the Living. In a few Days he goes to <HI>Wood&s;tock</HI> upon a Vi&s;it to his Uncle and Si&s;ter, and from thence to <HI>Foxhall,</HI> his <HI>York|&s;hire</HI> Seat. His Si&s;ter I believe ac|companies him thither, and I am engaged to pay him a Vi&s;it when I can find Lei&s;ure. This I fancy will &s;oon take place, as I &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;pend &s;ome Time there, and mu&s;t neverthele&s;s return to <HI>London</HI> early enough to attend old <HI>Hartley</HI> on his curious <HI>Oxford</HI> Ex|pedition. <HI>Vive, Vale,</HI> farewell.</P>

<P>YOUR la&s;t Letter my dear <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> was really a great Treat to me, and I give you Joy of your Rival from the Bottom of my Soul. What a Fund of Entertain|ment mu&s;t he be to Mi&s;s <HI>Hartley</HI> his intended Wife, if he accepts her Father's Invitation into <HI>Dor&s;et|&s;hire;</HI> which however I have my Doubts about. How often will his Pre&s;ence be u&s;eful, <HI>"Vice Cotis,"</HI> in&s;tead of a Whet&s;tone, to &s;harp|en her Wit upon, and relieve her
<PB N="111" REF="112">
Spirits from the dreadful Dejection of a Country Atmo&s;phere. Though I don't think her one of tho&s;e mad Girls, who can never exi&s;t but in the Noi&s;e and Di&s;&s;ipation of <HI>Lon|don.</HI> She likes it very much when &s;he is there 'tis true, as indeed is natural enough; but I really be|lieve her capable of &s;pending her Summer in the Country, with no other Diver&s;ions than her Books, her Hor&s;e, and her Hu&s;band, pro|vided &s;he is fond of him; and now and then the Variety of vi&s;iting in a good Neighbourhood. This at lea&s;t is the Opinion I have been inclined to entertain from what I have heard or &s;een of her, &s;ince the Night you introduced me at <HI>Rane|lagh,</HI> and you know I pique my|&s;elf upon a ready Di&s;cernment,
<PB N="112" REF="113">
even into Women's Characters. The Contra&s;t between <HI>Pedant</HI> and our Friend, Sir <HI>Thorobred,</HI> in the fir&s;t and &s;econd Parts of your Letter, is exceedingly ridiculous, and up|on Paper makes no bad Figure. How exqui&s;ite mu&s;t a Meeting be between them! I remember we had many of tho&s;e walking Libra|ries at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> I am glad the &s;aid Sir <HI>Thorobred</HI> is returned from the <HI>Hague;</HI> my Compliments when you go down. As you wi&s;ely re|mark, there is &s;omething very ori|ginal in the Compo&s;ition of that Man. Take away his exce&s;&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ion for Hor&s;es; (and yet, as every Body has their Hobby-hor&s;e, the Object perhaps may as well be real as metaphorical) His Imitation of <HI>Charles</HI> the Twelfth in all the
<PB N="113" REF="114">
negative Excellencies of dirty Face and Hands, old blue Coats, and Bra&s;s Buttons; and that &s;trange Extravagance and Wildne&s;s, which is &s;ometimes the Cau&s;e of good, and &s;ometimes of fooli&s;h Actions, ju&s;t as it happens: which as Whim and Humour prompt, will induce him to re&s;cue a Woman out of a Fire, or to throw a Waiter into one: take away all this, I &s;ay, and he is a very rational Fellow. As to Sen&s;e, he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very quick natural Parts, though I can|not &s;ay much for their Cultivation. Literature he never was particular|ly fond of, and when at the Uni|ver&s;ity, the illiberal Manners of its Teachers, greatly contribut|ed I believe to make him de|&s;pi&s;e the one for the Faults of the
<PB N="114" REF="115">
other, and throw it up entirely. This was my general Opinion of his Character when I la&s;t &s;aw him, and by your Account of his Morn|ing Vi&s;it in the <HI>Temple,</HI> his Tra|vels do not &s;eem to have produced the lea&s;t Alteration. I may add likewi&s;e, as the fini&s;hing Stroke to his Picture, and which indeed the utter Neglect of his Per&s;on &s;ome|what prepares one for; that in Re|gard to all the Minutiae of Life, if I may &s;o call them, &s;uch as &s;nuf|fing a Candle without throwing the Snuff about, mending a Pen, tear|ing a Piece of Paper evenly, or &s;ealing a Letter without burning both it and his own Fingers, with five Hundred other little Excellen|cies of this Sort, he has not the lea&s;t Idea of them. Now whether
<PB N="115" REF="116">
this proceeds from a natural and innate Awkwardne&s;s in &s;uch Mat|ters, or a Degree of Ab&s;ence and Inattention to them, I never yet could determine. For if he want|ed a Pair of clean Stockings, and his Servant &s;hould bring a Silk and a Thread one, or a Pair with half a dozen great Holes in them, he would put them on without per|ceiving either the one or the other. All the&s;e Peculiarities, <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> you are full as well acquainted with as my&s;elf, but upon mentioning his Name, I could not help falling in|to Remarks, and &s;cribbling my Paper with them.</P>
<P>To return now to the Beginning of your Letter, (for I will not trou|ble you this Time with any Hob|by-hor&s;ical Intelligence of my
<PB N="116" REF="117">
Buildings and Alterations,) I am very &s;orry to find my&s;elf under the di&s;agreeable Nece&s;&s;ity of reprobat|ing that profane Ridicule of mo|dern Novels, with which you open your Misfortunes; and at the &s;ame Time mu&s;t take the Liberty of in|forming you, that "What &s;hould be great, you turn to Farce," as <HI>Prior</HI> &s;ays; (I will not wi&s;h you puni&s;hed by the In&s;ertion of a La|dle;) or to &s;earch farther into Anti|quity for a Quotation, "What is Sport to you is Death to us." <HI>Vide Ae&s;op</HI>'s Fable of the Boys and Frogs. To &s;peak more plainly, though your <HI>London</HI> Volatility may prompt you to laugh at every Thing that &s;peaks feelingly to the &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ions; that tells the &s;ad Tale of di&s;appointed Love, or

breathes amid&s;t innumerable Stars and Da&s;hes, the Strains of Refine|ment and Sen&s;ibility: our Country Swains and Dam&s;els are very diffe|rently affected by them. To pro|mote your Conver&s;ion, if that be po&s;&s;ible, I de&s;ire you will read the inclo&s;ed Letter, which was found a few Days &s;ince in a Clo&s;et in one of the Garrets, and by the Signa|ture appears to have been written by Mrs. <HI>Melmoth</HI>'s la&s;t Maid, who quitted her about a Twelvemonth ago. I always thought there was &s;omething particular and romantic in the Girl, and &s;u&s;pected a Love Affair at the Bottom. The Argu|ment of the inclo&s;ed is as follows. That <HI>John o'Nokes</HI> and her&s;elf felt a mutual Attachment to each other, and that &s;he had almo&s;t given her
<PB N="118" REF="119">
Con&s;ent to marry him; but that unluckily <HI>Tom O'Stiles</HI> becoming acquainted with her about that Time, is likewi&s;e de&s;perately &s;mit|ten. Upon this, he declares his Pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;he, though not ex|periencing any &s;imilar Inclination on her Part, and being al&s;o previ|ou&s;ly engaged, is neverthele&s;s worked up to &s;uch a Pitch of ge|neral Philanthropy, and Sentiment, and Pathos, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. as to determine that &s;he will marry nei|ther of them, and by this noble Self-denial, (according to our dull Apprehen&s;ions at lea&s;t) &s;he makes three People unhappy in&s;tead of one. Whether &s;he took her Idea from <HI>Foote</HI>'s Primitive Puppet|&s;how, I cannot pretend to &s;ay. As to the Letter, it appears to
<PB N="119" REF="120">
have been written ju&s;t before &s;he quitted our Place, and whither &s;he went afterwards, nobody knows hereabouts. However I &s;end you the Original, and leave you to de|cipher it at your Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>About ten o'Clock la&s;t Night, I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed by the Appearance of my Brother <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Melmoth-Place,</HI> when I ima|gined him treading the Paths of Slaughter in <HI>America.</HI> I cannot &s;ay his Looks are much improved by the Expedition. Indeed he &s;ays that he has hardly enjoyed a Day's good Health &s;ince he left <HI>England,</HI> and as the Climate does not at all agree with his Con&s;titution, he has obtained Leave of Ab&s;ence, and has &s;ome Thoughts of re&s;igning his Commi&s;&s;ion, and entirely quit|ting

<P>MY dear <HI>Rugg,</HI> how long do you mean to keep that odi|ous Name by you? I prote&s;t it gives one the Idea of &s;omething uncivilized even in the writing it, and di&s;per&s;es every finer Idea one might have to communicate. Be|&s;ides, 'tis &s;o wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with your Character. Do look out for a young Fellow with &s;omething delicate and <HI>piano</HI> in his Appella|tion, and with a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;uited to your own. Shall I recommend one to you? Or will you accept of
<PB N="134" REF="135">
one of mine? <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> I cannot &s;pare, but you are welcome to my Fa|ther's Friend, Mr. <HI>Pedant;</HI> at lea&s;t as &s;oon as I am tired with tea&s;ing him. He is returned to <HI>Oxford;</HI> the fitte&s;t Place for him. What think you of the Name? How would the Title of Mrs. <HI>Pedant,</HI> Wife and Bedmaker to a College Tutor, &s;ound in your Ears?</P>
<P>Not to joke longer, I have real|ly a great Piece of News for you, and &s;omething to propo&s;e &s;eriou&s;ly to your Con&s;ideration in the Ma|trimonial Way. As for my&s;elf, I believe I never &s;hall think &s;eriou&s;ly of any Thing 'till I <HI>am</HI> married; and then I &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t draw my&s;elf up with my Hands before me, talk with a grave Face about the Cares of a Family, and delibe|rate
<PB N="135" REF="136">
with my Hou&s;ekeeper for two Hours every Morning, what Piece of &s;alting Beef &s;hould be ordered from the Butcher, and whether a Goo&s;eberry or a Currant Pye will be be&s;t for Dinner.</P>
<P>Come now for the News. <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> dined with us a Day or two ago, and among&s;t other Intelligence told us that he had received a Letter from his Friend <HI>Charles Melmoth,</HI> mentioning the Return of his Bro|ther the Captain from <HI>America,</HI> on Account of the Climate not agree|ing. What think you of him for a <HI>Caro Spo&s;o?</HI> If I recollect, he was an old Flame of yours before he went abroad.</P>
<P>O! I beg Leave to congratulate you likewi&s;e upon your Brother's Arrival. The Name of <HI>Rugg</HI> was
<PB N="136" REF="137">
for him and him only! Pray pre|&s;ent my re&s;pectful Compliments, and tell him I rejoice to find he makes his public Entry in the Morning Po&s;t with &s;o much <HI>Eclat.</HI> I have &s;een him there with &s;ome Circum&s;tances in Regard to the Cour&s;e of his Travels, which were entirely new to me. <Q>Such a Day arrived in <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>T&mdash; R</HI>&mdash;, commonly known by the Name of the rough riding, or <HI>Thorough-bred</HI> Baronet, from his Travels to the Country of the <HI>Houyhnhnms.</HI> He is &s;aid to be much improved by this Expedition, and has brought over with him a fine <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> Stallion, with two <HI>Yahoos</HI> to look after it. He is the &s;econd <HI>European</HI> that ever
<PB N="137" REF="138">
vi&s;ited tho&s;e Parts, and is re|ported to have detected many Errors in Captain <HI>Lemuel Gulli|ver</HI>'s Account, which it is hoped he will &s;oon favour the Public with.</Q></P>
<P>A few Days afterwards appears the following Paragraph. <Q>We are &s;orry to inform the Public of the Death of one of the Ani|mals called <HI>Yahoos,</HI> lately im|ported by a certain <HI>Rugg</HI>&mdash;ed Baronet, which happened on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t.</Q> <Q>It was occa|&s;ioned a Corre&s;pondent informs us, by the following Accident. The Animal it &s;eems having &s;ome Time before been very re|fractory, and having even killed a Servant who attempted to cha&s;|ti&s;e him, was obliged to be
<PB N="138" REF="139">
clo&s;ely confined. On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning however, his Keepers unchained him, and having as they thought &s;ufficiently &s;ecured him with Ropes, put him into a Cart in Order to remove him; when unluckily the Rope about his Neck having a &s;lip Knot to it, entangled with a Po&s;t not far from the <HI>Oxford Road</HI> Turnpike, and in&s;tantly &s;trangled him. Dr. <HI>H-nt-r</HI> is &s;aid to be making Intere&s;t for the Body for Di&s;&s;ec|tion, as he propo&s;es mounting the Skeleton upon that of the Queen's <HI>Elephant,</HI> which he late|ly had the Honour to anato|mize.</Q></P>

<PB N="139" REF="140">
tell me though, in &s;ober &s;erious Sadne&s;s, is all this true? I have a mon&s;trous Mind to write a long Letter to your Brother upon the Subject, and prote&s;t that I believe every Word of it. I find he in|tends taking you into <HI>York&s;hire</HI> with him. I wi&s;h he would bring you to <HI>London,</HI> to keep me Com|pany for a Month, for my Father for Rea&s;ons of State, which I can|not dive thoroughly to the Bot|tom of, has determined to continue here till the End of <HI>July</HI> or Begin|ning of <HI>Augu&s;t.

<P>WELL, my old Friend, Mat|ters go on &s;wimmingly be|tween Mr. <HI>Pedant</HI> and <HI>Kitty.</HI> He came according to his Promi&s;e the next Morning to Breakfa&s;t, and very glad I was to &s;ee him. How|ever he did not &s;eem much in|clined to talk whil&s;t I was there, which I &s;uppo&s;e was owing to an Unwillingne&s;s to declare him&s;elf before a third Per&s;on. So as &s;oon as Breakfa&s;t was fini&s;hed, I quitted the Room, that he might feel him|&s;elf
<PB N="143" REF="146">
more free and unembara&s;&s;ed when left alone with my Daugh|ter. And by the Sequel it proved that this Step of mine was very judicious; for I went immediately into my Study, which is next to the Room they &s;at in, and li&s;ten|ing attentively, I &s;oon found they had begun a Conver&s;ation together, and though I could not hear what it was about, yet I am &s;ure my Daughter was very well plea&s;ed with him, for I heard her laugh hear|tily. Sometime after I could di&s;tin|gui&s;h two other female Voices, which upon Enquiry I found to appertain to the Mi&s;s <HI>Yaffles.</HI> The&s;e &s;eemed join in the Di&s;cour&s;e, which now grew louder and louder, mixed with ince&s;&s;ant Peals of Merriment. As for Mr. <HI>Pedant,</HI> nothing could
<PB N="144" REF="147">
be a &s;tronger Proof of <HI>his</HI> Satisfacti|on, than that he could hardly prevail upon him&s;elf to quit them, for I believe he &s;tayed there near four Hours. So I have no Doubt in my own Mind, but that he is a little hampered in the Charms of the Fair, for even the mo&s;t learned of us &s;ometimes feel our&s;elves &s;ubject to the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love. If he &s;hould, what a happy Thing it will be for my Daughter! Her Fortune will be made at once, and I can tell her &s;uch Hu&s;bands are not to be met with every Day. However, I do not &s;ay much upon the Sub|ject to her, becau&s;e I think the&s;e Things always turn out be&s;t when left to them&s;elves; but I have con|trived &s;uch a Plan as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily increa&s;e the Intimacy between
<PB N="145" REF="148">
them, in&s;omuch that if I have any Skill in Prophecy, Matters will be brought to a Conclu&s;ion before the End of the Summer. I &s;hall not let you any farther into the Secret before the fir&s;t Part of my De&s;ign has actually taken Place, as upon that the Succe&s;s of the whole in a great Mea&s;ure depends. Not that I have the lea&s;t Fear of its failing, for I have a Confidant to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, by who&s;e Dili|gence and Exertions I have no Doubt of all Things being brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to a right I&s;&s;ue. Who he is, I &s;hall not inform you at pre&s;ent, a Secre&s;y you know is the Soul of Con&s;piracy, and they &s;ay Walls have Ears, but &s;hall proceed now with tran&s;cribing my Sentiments on a Subject which indeed I &s;hould
<PB N="146" REF="149">
have mentioned much &s;ooner, had not my Proceedings and Con&s;ider|ations concerning my Daughter's Marriage, left me hardly a Moment to &s;pare for any other Bu&s;ine&s;s. I mean the <HI>Nihil</HI> or <HI>Nothing</HI> of the Schoolmen, which, if you recol|lect, we di&s;puted about for three Afternoons at <HI>Staples,</HI> when nei|ther of us being able to make his Ideas on the Subject at all clear to the Under&s;tanding of the other, we left off ju&s;t where we begun.</P>
<P>Now I am inclined to think that there is a very con&s;iderable Di&s;|tinction and Difference to be made between <HI>Nothing</HI> as taken in its &s;trict and confined Sen&s;e, and <HI>No|thing</HI> taken in its more general and exten&s;ive one. <HI>Nothing</HI> taken &s;trictly, &s;eems to be that which is impo&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="147" REF="150">
and implies an ab&s;olute Con|tradiction; whereas <HI>Nothing</HI> ta|ken more generally, is applied both to what is po&s;&s;ible as well as what is impo&s;&s;ible. Again, <HI>No|thing</HI> may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into a Negative, which is the Ab&s;ence of Reality in any Subject; and then there is <HI>Nothing</HI> privative, which is the Ab&s;ence of Reality in a Sub|ject capable thereof, or wherein it ought to be found. And as to the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> or <HI>Impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> of a Thing, we know that to be <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> which exceeds or is beyond all po&s;|&s;ible Bounds, and which in &s;hort can never happen. And if this be true, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, accord|ing to the Argument deduced from Contraries, that what&s;oever does not exceed or go beyond tho&s;e
<PB N="148" REF="151">
Bounds, but which, from its not exceeding, is con&s;equently and ne|ce&s;&s;arily contained therein; may be denominated or con&s;idered as a Thing <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> or to be done. And of Things <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> there are &s;everal Species. Fir&s;t, there is the <HI>proba|ble,</HI> or what is likely to come to pa&s;s; then there is the <HI>improbable,</HI> or unlikely, which neverthele&s;s is a Species of the <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> ina&s;much as many Things may be very <HI>po&s;&s;i|ble,</HI> though they are very <HI>improba|ble.</HI> And in Regard to Things <HI>probable</HI> and <HI>improbable,</HI> it is often very <HI>probable</HI> that a Thing &s;hould happen contrary to all <HI>Probability,</HI> as &mdash; . . . .</P>

there. I came down here upon a Hack I bought at <HI>Tatter&s;all</HI>'s, which I meant to have rode to <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> but a damn'd Brute of my Uncle's, one of the Cart-hor&s;es, kicked him plump on the Stifle Ye&s;terday Morning, as they were in the Field together. He is a de|veli&s;h clever Gelding. A dark Che&s;nut, fifteen Hands and an Inch, fine Forehand, rather too much Daylight under him, but gets on helli&s;hly, a remarkable Gift of go|ing, a very good Mouth, and he &s;hall be a &s;ound one however. So I &s;hall be obliged to kick my&s;elf down upon Po&s;t-hor&s;es, (as for a Chai&s;e, I hate it,) and leave him behind me for the pre&s;ent. I met <HI>Tom Fetlock</HI> the Day I &s;aw you, and de&s;ired him to come to <HI>Foxhall</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="156">
as &s;oon as he could, that I &s;hould be down in ten Days or a Fort|night, and expected to find him ready to receive me. Pray when do I &s;ee you there? I hope &s;peed|ily. I have a little grey Poney with a hogg'd Mane, will ju&s;t &s;uit your &s;ober Stile of riding. It is what you would call as quiet as a Lamb, and I a damn'd Slugg, or a Jacka&s;s. At lea&s;t it was &s;o before I went Abroad. I u&s;ed &s;ometimes to ride him to cover, but he's got almo&s;t too old for Work now. I never regretted any thing &s;o much in my Life, &s;ince the Day I &s;trained <HI>Black Sloven</HI> leaping a Turnpike Gate, as I did lo&s;ing the la&s;t Hunting Sea&s;on in <HI>Holland.</HI> Poor Fellow, he never was worth Six|pence

afterwards! though I got him tolerably well of that too, but then, and what the <HI>Devil</HI> was the Meaning of it, I can't con|ceive, there came a Windgall in the near Fetlock behind. So I opened the Swelling about an Inch, and &s;queezed out the Jelly, and put &s;ome white of Egg and Oil of Bays with Tow to it, but I believe it was too much among&s;t the Si|news, for I was obliged to &s;ell him at la&s;t to <HI>March</HI> at <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> who fired him and worked him on the Road.
