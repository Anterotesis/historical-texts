<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>As far as this intere&s;ting TRIAL. has gone, it has been conducted with that rigid impartiality which &s;o particularly di&s;tingui&s;hes the various Courts of BRITISH JURISPRUDENCE!&mdash;How it may ter|minate can be known only to the ruler of the&s;e great events: indeed, from the contrariety of weighty evidence already advanced, and the cloud of te&s;timonies yet to be adduced, it would be highly indecorous, to indulge even a conjecture upon the probability of its deci&s;ion!!</P>
<P>The COURT have wi&s;ely re&s;olved to &s;it without further adjournment, in order now to receive at their Bar, the evidence of the fir&s;t POLITICAL, and LI|TERARY Characters, again&s;t whom, exceptions were &s;o ingeniou&s;ly taken by Council, but which however have all been mo&s;t con&s;titutionally over-ruled. The&s;e

being gone through, the &s;age and learned POLONIUS in per&s;on, will &s;um up the whole evidence, and after delivering a &s;olemn and eloquent charge from the Bench, receive from the GRAND INQUEST, that VERDICT. which no doubt, will &s;oon tend to the complete admini&s;tration of LITERARY JUSTICE, by &s;etting this GREAT QUESTION at re&s;t for ever!!!</P>

<P>PENDING the di&s;tingui&s;hed inque&s;t under which the fact is now trying, whether the newly di&s;covered DRAMA, is, or is not from the pen of SHAK|SPEARE, it would be highly indecorous to hazard a &s;ingle conjecture upon it.&mdash;The EDITOR, therefore, will content him&s;elf with merely giving a faithful tran&s;cript of all that has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively recorded on this important &s;ubject in that fa&s;hionable Intel|ligencer the MORNING HERALD: only remarking, that whatever may be the final i&s;&s;ue of the TRIAL, the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected from the Piece it&s;elf by the &s;e|veral

If poor CHATTERTON had contented him&s;elf, with drawing literary trea&s;ure in <HI>moderation</HI> from the monki&s;h che&s;t of ROWLEY, his own <HI>inventive genius</HI> had probably remained unknown!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your SHAKSPEARE corre&s;pondents know but little of what is going forward in the <HI>mine of di&s;co|very!</HI> Lord, Sir, if they wi&s;h to get at the <HI>whole truth,</HI> they mu&s;t dip <HI>deep</HI> into the <HI>old che&s;t,</HI> as the an|cients did into the <HI>Pierean</HI> well!&mdash;indeed they are not correct even in what they have &s;tated. For in|&s;tance,&mdash;the <HI>precious</HI> LOCK OF HAIR! how comes it, they were &s;o ignorant, as not to know, that Mr. <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> COLLICK, the fir&s;t <HI>Hair Merchant</HI> in the univer&s;e, has critically in&s;pected it, and, re|gardle&s;s of the <HI>&s;acred head</HI> of <HI>fiction</HI> from whence it was &s;horn, he, as a <HI>man of bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> could only be brought to &s;ay, that if the whole <HI>&s;tring</HI> were as good as the <HI>&s;ample,</HI> it was worth no more in the <HI>trade,</HI> than 3s. 9d. an ounce?&mdash;The pointed di&s;tich on the envelope, however, as his Grace of LEEDS declares, is worth a million!&mdash;Here it is:
<Q><L>"Ere Age with twinge your nerves doth &s;hocke,</L>
<L>"Catch Love, like Time, by the forelocke!"</L></Q>
<PB N="5" REF="11">
By which our annotators will no doubt tell us, that the <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> WAG quaintly inculcates the youthful libertini&s;m of&mdash;<HI>catch, as catch can!</HI>&mdash;Among the more recent trea&s;ures, are a moth-eaten <HI>under</HI> PETTICOAT, an undoubted <HI>original!</HI> Mr. MALONE, who, with all his ability, knows but lit|tle about <HI>petticoats,</HI> &s;ays, this could be no part of the paraphernalia of the immortal Bard;&mdash;but Mrs. PIOZZI, and the whole <HI>Blue Stocking Club,</HI> are de|cidedly of a contrary opinion, and that for the be&s;t of all feminine rea&s;ons; viz. becau&s;e Mi&s;s HATH|AWAY, when &s;he became Mrs. SHAKSPEARE, ne|ver failed to <HI>wear</HI> the BREECHES!&mdash;we have al&s;o Mr. <HI>Bo&s;well's</HI> authority for this, among&s;t other <HI>dome&s;tica facta</HI> of the Poet. The next curio&s;ity for the <HI>amateurs,</HI> is, a <HI>love</HI> VALENTINE, &s;urrounded, according to antient u&s;age, with <HI>hearts! cupids! doves!</HI> and <HI>darts!</HI> and in the centre, a <HI>typifying</HI> figure of a <HI>cock</HI> without a <HI>combe,</HI> (according to an|tique &s;pelling) with this inexplicable <HI>anagram:</HI><Q><L>"If to my armes you'll fondlye roame,</L>

<P><PB N="6" REF="12">

<P>Even Mr. STEEVENS admits the unque&s;tionable authenticity of this valuable addendum to the <HI>cull|nary art,</HI> by declaring, that Shak&s;peare could not endure the <HI>&s;tones</HI> of plumbs, which, from &s;etting his <HI>teeth on edge,</HI> were called <HI>jar</HI> rai&s;ins; and literally gives an appropriate citation of the following pa&s;|&s;age, from the Poet's <HI>own words,</HI> which will cer|tainly be received as the be&s;t <HI>glo&s;&s;ary</HI> to his <HI>own plumb pudding:</HI><Q>"SYLVUS.&mdash;Put <HI>dates</HI> enough into the bag: but, deare&s;t chuck, I prithee make me <HI>geldings</HI> of the PLUMBES!"</Q></P>
