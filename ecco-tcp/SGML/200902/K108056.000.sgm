<HEAD>ACCOUNT of Mrs. SIDDONS's fir&s;t Reception in DUBLIN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this whim&s;ical Account fir&s;t appeared in Dublin, the Lady's friends were outrageous again&s;t the Author. The Hu|mouri&s;t kept him&s;elf &s;nug while a number of Literary Iri&s;hmen in London and Dublin were claiming the prai&s;e due to him, which indeed they have continued to do to this hour, though the plea&s;ant fugitive is now well known to be the offspring of the facetious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> ON Saturday Mrs. Siddons, about whom all the World has been talking, expo&s;ed her beautiful, adamantine, &s;oft, and lovely Per&s;on for the fir&s;t time at the Theatre Royal, Smock-Alley, in the bewitch|ing, melting and all-tearful Character of I&s;abella. From the repeated panegyrics in the impartial Lon|don News-papers, we were taught to expect the &s;ight of an heavenly Angel, but how were we &s;upernaturally &s;urpri&s;ed into the mo&s;t awful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at beholding a mortal Godde&s;s!</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was crowded with hundreds more than it could hold, with thou&s;ands of admiring &s;pectators that went away without a &s;ight. This extraordinary Phaenomenon of Tragic excellence! this Star of Melpomene! this Comet of the Stage! this Sun of the firmament of the Mu&s;es! this Moon of blank ver&s;e! this Queen and Prince&s;s of tears! this Donnellan of the poi&s;oned bowl! this Empre&s;s <HI>Ru&s;ty Fu&s;ty</HI> of the pi&s;tol and dagger! this Chao of
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
Shake&s;peare! this World of weeping clouds! this Juno of commanding a&s;pect! this Terp&s;ichore of the curtain and &s;cenes! this Pro&s;erpine of fire and earthquake! this Katterfelto of wonders, exceeded expectation, went beyond belief, and &s;oared above all the powers of de&s;cription! She was Nature it&s;elf!&mdash;She was the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite work of art! She was the very dai&s;y, primro&s;e, tube-ro&s;e, &s;weet-briar, &s;urze-blo&s;&s;om, gilliflower, wall-flower, cauliflower, auricula, and ro&s;emary; in &s;hort, &s;he was the Bouquet of Parna&s;&s;us!</P>
<P>Where expectation was rai&s;ed &s;o high, it was thought &s;he would be injured by her appearance&mdash; but it was the audience who were injured. Several fainted even before the curtain drew up!&mdash;but when &s;he came to the &s;cene of parting with her. wedding-ring, ah! what a &s;ight was there! The very &s;idiers in the Orche&s;tra, albeit, unu&s;ed to melting mood, blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread and butter; and when the bell rang for mu&s;ic between the acts, the tears ran from the ba&s;|&s;oon player's eyes in &s;uch plentiful &s;howers, that they choaked the finger &s;tops, and making a &s;pout of the in&s;trument, poured in &s;uch a torrent on the fir&s;t fidler's book, that not &s;eeing the Overture was in two &s;harps, the leader of the band actually played in one flat.</P>
<P>But the &s;obs and &s;ighs of the groaning audience, and the noi&s;e of the corks drawn from the &s;melling-bottles, prevented the mi&s;take between the flats and the &s;harps being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>One hundred and nine ladies fainted! forty-&s;ix went into fits! and ninety-five had &s;trong hy&s;terics! The world will &s;carcely credit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> when they are told that fourteen children, five old women, a one-handed &s;ailor, and &s;ix common-council men,
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
were actually drowned in the inundation of tears that flowed from the galleries, lattices, and boxes, to encrea&s;e the briny pond in the pit. The water was three feet deep, and the people that were ob|liged to &s;tand upon the benches, were in that po|&s;ition up to their ankles in tears!</P>
<P>An Act of Parliament again&s;t her playing any more will certainly pa&s;s, for &s;he has infected all the Volunteers, and they &s;it reading the Fatal Marriage, crying and roaring the whole morning, at the ex|pectation of &s;eeing this Giant's Cau&s;eway, this Salmon Leap of wonders at night! An addre&s;s has been pre&s;ented to the good Earl of Charlemont by the principal Volunteers, and backed by Doctor Quin and the Faculty of Dublin, praying him to &s;tay at home the evening of her appearance, el&s;e they are convinced &s;he'll tear his infirm frame in pieces with her terrific &s;creams, when &s;he's dragged from the corp&s;e of Biron, and they'll lo&s;e the greate&s;t General that ever headed an army. Nature, mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, in one of her bountiful moments, in one of her charitable and humane lei&s;ure hours, in one of her &s;miling days, in one of her happy weeping months, and in one of her all-&s;orrowing glad&s;ome years, made this human lump of clayey perfection!</P>
<P>Oh! happy Hibernia, ble&s;&s;ed Ierne, &s;anctified land of Saints, what a hear&s;e load, what a coffin full, what a church-yard tree of the brighte&s;t ex|cellence of excellencies now &s;tands on the turf of thy fruitful earth!</P>
<P>From Cork, from Kilarney, from Galway, from Ballina&s;loe, from Eyrecourt, from the Ea&s;t, from the We&s;t, from the North, from the South, from I&s;land Bridge, from Lazor's-Hill, from the banks of the Canal to the New Road, at the back of
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
Drumcondra, &s;hall millions come to Smock-Alley, to &s;ee this a&s;toni&s;hing woman!</P>
<P>The &s;treets round the Theatre &s;hall be crowded, and the very Gabbards that carry coals to I&s;land Bridge &s;hall &s;top at the Blind-Quay, and land their unpoli&s;hed Watermen to &s;pend thirteen-pence for a &s;eat in the upper gallery when I&s;abella is per|formed!</P>
<P>O thou univer&s;al Genius, what pity it is that thy talents are &s;o confined to Tragedy alone! No age&mdash; nay, the Roman Theatre, the Stage at Con&s;tantino|ple&mdash;Nero him&s;elf never performed the &s;cene of madne&s;s, of grief, of joy, of woe, of di&s;tre&s;s, of &s;orrow, and of pity, &s;o well as Mrs. Siddons!</P>
<P>May the cur&s;es of an in&s;ulted nation pur&s;ue the gentlemen of the College, the gentlemen of the Bar, and the Peers and Peere&s;&s;es, who&s;e wi&s;dom and di&s;cernment have been &s;o highly extolled, that hi&s;&s;ed her on the &s;econd night. True it is, Mr. Garrick never could make any thing of her, and pronounced her below mediocrity&mdash;true it is, the London audience once did not like her; but what of that? Ri&s;e up bright Godde&s;s of the Sock and Bu&s;kin, and &s;oar to unknown Regions of immortal Prai&s;e, for</P>
