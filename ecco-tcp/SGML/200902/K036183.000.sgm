<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t diffidence that the following pages are &s;ub|mitted to the in&s;pection of the Public: yet, however the limited abi|lities of the author may have prevented her from &s;ucceeding to her wi&s;h in the execution of her pre&s;ent attempt, &s;he humbly tru&s;ts that the uprightne&s;s of her intention will procure it a candid and favourable reception. The fol|lowing little E&s;&s;ays are chiefly calcu|lated for the younger part of her own
<PB N="2" REF="7">&s;ex, who, &s;he flatters her&s;elf, will not e&s;teem them the le&s;s, becau&s;e they were written immediately for their &s;ervice. She by no means pretends to have compo&s;ed a regular &s;y&s;tem of morals, or a fini&s;hed plan of conduct: &s;he has only endeavoured to make a few re|marks on &s;uch circum&s;tances as &s;eemed to her &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome improve|ment, and on &s;uch &s;ubjects as &s;he ima|gined were particularly intere&s;ting to young ladies, on their fir&s;t introduc|tion into the world. She hopes they will not be offended if &s;he has occa|&s;ionally pointed out certain qualities, and &s;ugge&s;ted certain tempers, and di&s;po&s;itions, as <HI>peculiarly feminine,</HI> and hazarded &s;ome ob&s;ervations which na|turally aro&s;e from the &s;ubject, on the different characters which mark the &s;exes. And here again &s;he takes the liberty to repeat that the&s;e di&s;tinctions
<PB N="3" REF="8">cannot be too nicely maintained; for be&s;ides tho&s;e important qualities com|mon to both, each &s;ex has its re&s;pec|tive, appropriated qualifications, which would cea&s;e to be meritorious, the in|&s;tant they cea&s;ed to be appropriated. Nature, propriety, and cu&s;tom have pre&s;cribed certain bounds to each; bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt to break down; and indeed it would be highly impolitic to annihilate di&s;tinctions from which each acquires excellence, and to attempt innovations, by which both would be lo&s;ers.</P>
<P>WOMEN therefore never under&s;tand their own intere&s;ts &s;o little, as when they affect tho&s;e qualities and accom|pli&s;hments, from the want of which they derive their highe&s;t merit. <Q>The <HI>porcelain</HI> clay of human kind,</Q> &s;ays
<PB N="4" REF="9">an admired writer, &s;peaking of the &s;ex. Greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility; and this weakne&s;s, na|tural and moral, clearly points out the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;uperior degree of caution, retirement, and re&s;erve.</P>
<P>If the author may be allowed to keep up the allu&s;ion of the poet, ju&s;t quoted, &s;he would a&s;k if we do not put the fine&s;t va&s;es, and the co&s;tlie&s;t images in places of the greate&s;t &s;ecu|rity, and mo&s;t remote from any pro|bability of accident, or de&s;truction? By being &s;o &s;ituated, they find their protection in their weakne&s;s, and their &s;afety in their delicacy. This meta|phor is far from being u&s;ed with a de|&s;ign of placing young ladies in a tri|vial, unimportant light; it is only introduced to in&s;inuate, that where there is more beauty, and more weak|ne&s;s,
<PB N="5" REF="10">there &s;hould be greater circum|&s;pection, and &s;uperior prudence.</P>
<P>MEN, on the contrary, are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theatre of human life. Like the &s;tronger and more &s;ub&s;tantial wares, they derive no injury, and lo&s;e no poli&s;h by being always expo&s;ed, and engaged in the con&s;tant commerce of the world. It is their proper element, where they re&s;pire their natural air, and exert their noble&s;t powers, in &s;ituations which call them into action. They were intended by Providence for the bu&s;tling &s;cenes of life; to appear terrible in arms, u&s;eful in commerce, &s;hining in coun&s;els.</P>
<P>THE Author fears it will be hazard|ing a very bold remark, in the opi|nion of many ladies, when &s;he adds,
<PB N="6" REF="11">that the female mind, in general, does not appear capable of attaining &s;o high a degree of perfection in &s;cience as the male. Yet &s;he hopes to be for|given when &s;he ob&s;erves al&s;o, that as it does not &s;eem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extra|ordinary abilities of this kind, it is not at all le&s;&s;ened by the imputation of not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. It is readily al|lowed, that the &s;ex have lively ima|ginations, and tho&s;e exqui&s;ite percep|tions of the beautiful and defective, which come under the denomination of Ta&s;te. But preten&s;ions to that &s;trength of intellect, which is requi&s;ite to pe|netrate into the ab&s;tru&s;er walks of li|terature, it is pre&s;umed they will rea|dily relinqui&s;h. There are green pa&s;tures, and plea&s;ant vallies, where they may wander with &s;afety to them&s;elves, and delight to others. They may cul|tivate
<PB N="7" REF="12">the ro&s;es of imagination, and the valuable fruits of morals and criti|ci&s;m; but the &s;teeps of Parna&s;&s;us &s;ew, comparatively, have attempted to &s;cale with &s;ucce&s;s. And when it is con&s;ider|ed, that many languages, and many &s;ciences, mu&s;t contribute to the per|fection of poetical compo&s;ition, it will appear le&s;s &s;trange. The lofty Epic, the pointed Satire, and the more dar|ing and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;lights of the Tragic Mu&s;e, &s;eem re&s;erved for the bold ad|venturers of the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>NOR does this a&s;&s;ertion, it is appre|hended, at all injure the intere&s;ts of the women; they have other preten|&s;ions, on which to value them&s;elves, and other qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties much better calcu|lated to an&s;wer their particular pur|po&s;es. We are enamoured of the &s;oft &s;trains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan
<PB N="8" REF="13">Mu&s;e, while, to the &s;weet notes of the pa&s;toral reed, they &s;ing the Conten|tions of the Shepherds, the Ble&s;&s;ings of Love, or the innocent Delights of ru|ral Life. Has it ever been a&s;cribed to them as a defect, that their Eclogues do not treat of active &s;cenes, of bu&s;y cities, and of wa&s;ting war? No: their &s;implicity is their perfection, and they are only blamed when they have too little of it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the lofty bards who &s;trung their bolder harps to higher mea&s;ures, and &s;ung the <HI>Wrath</HI> of <HI>Pe|leus' Son,</HI> and <HI>Man's fir&s;t Di&s;obedience,</HI> have never been cen&s;ured for want of &s;weetne&s;s and refinement. The &s;ub|lime, the nervous, and the ma&s;culine, characteri&s;e their compo&s;itions; as the beautiful, the &s;oft, and the delicate, mark tho&s;e of the others. Grandeur,
<PB N="9" REF="14">dignity, and force, di&s;tingui&s;h the one &s;pecies; ea&s;e, &s;implicity, and purity, the other. Both &s;hine from their na|tive, di&s;tinct, unborrowed merits, not from tho&s;e which are foreign, adven|titious, and unnatural. Yet tho&s;e ex|cellencies, which make up the e&s;&s;ential and con&s;tituent parts of poetry, they have in common.</P>
<P>WOMEN have generally quicker per|ceptions; men have ju&s;ter &s;entiments. &mdash;Women con&s;ider how things may be prettily &s;aid; men how they may be properly &s;aid.&mdash;In women, (young ones at lea&s;t) &s;peaking accompanies, and &s;ometimes precedes reflection; in men, reflection is the antecedent.&mdash; Women &s;peak to &s;hine or to plea&s;e; men, to convince or confute.&mdash;Wo|men admire what is brilliant; men what is &s;olid.&mdash;Women prefer an ex|temporaneous
<PB N="10" REF="15">&s;ally of wit, or a &s;park|ling effu&s;ion of fancy, before the mo&s;t accurate rea&s;oning, or the mo&s;t labo|rious inve&s;tigation of facts. In lite|rary compo&s;ition, women are plea&s;ed with point, turn, and antithe&s;is; men with ob&s;ervation, and a ju&s;t deduc|tion of effects from their cau&s;es.&mdash; Women are fond of incident, men of argument.&mdash;Women admire pa&s;&s;ionate|ly, men approve cautiou&s;ly.&mdash;One &s;ex will think it betrays a want of feel|ing to be moderate in their applau&s;e, the other will be afraid of expo&s;ing a want of judgment by being in rap|tures with any thing.&mdash;Men refu&s;e to give way to the emotions they actu|ally feel, while women &s;ometimes af|fect to be tran&s;ported beyond what the occa&s;ion will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">As a farther confirmation of what has been advanced on the different bent of the under&s;tanding in the &s;exes, it may be ob&s;erved, that we have heard of many female wits, but never of one female logician&mdash;of many admirable writers of memoirs, but ne|ver of one chronologer.&mdash;In the bound|le&s;s and a&euml;rial regions of romance, and in that fa&s;hionable &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition which &s;ucceeded it, and which carries a nearer approximation to the manners of the world, the women cannot be excelled: this imaginary &s;oil they have a peculiar talent for cul|tivating, becau&s;e here, Invention labours more, and judgment le&s;s.</P>
<P>THE merit of this kind of writing con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>vrai&s;emblance</HI> to real life as to the events them&s;elves, with
<PB N="12" REF="17">a certain elevation in the narrative, which places them, if not above what is natural, yet above what is common. It farther con&s;i&s;ts in the art of inte|re&s;ting the tender feelings by a pathe|tic repre&s;entation of tho&s;e minute, en|dearing, dome&s;tic circum&s;tances, which take captive the &s;oul before it has time to &s;hield it&s;elf with the armour of reflection. To amu&s;e, rather than to in&s;truct, or to in&s;truct indirectly by &s;hort inferences, drawn from a long concatenation of circum&s;tances, is at once the bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;ort of com|po&s;ition, and one of the characteri&s;tics of female genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE author does not apprehend it makes again&s;t her GENERAL po&s;ition, that this nation can boa&s;t a female critic, poet, hi&s;torian, lingui&s;t, philo&s;opher, and morali&s;t, equal to mo&s;t of the other &s;ex. To the&s;e particular in&s;tances others might be adduced; but it is pre&s;umed, that they only &s;tand as exceptions again&s;t the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule it&s;elf.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18">IN &s;hort, it appears that the mind in each &s;ex has &s;ome natural kind of bias, which con&s;titutes a di&s;tinction of character, and that the happine&s;s of both depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the pre&s;ervation and ob&s;ervance of this di&s;tinction. For where would be the &s;uperior plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction re&s;ulting from mixed conver&s;ation, if this difference were aboli&s;hed? If the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the &s;ame, no benefit or enter|tainment would ari&s;e from the tedious and in&s;ipid uniformity of &s;uch an in|tercour&s;e; whereas con&s;iderable ad|vantages are reaped from a &s;elect &s;o|ciety of both &s;exes. The rough an|gles and a&s;perities of male manners are imperceptibly filed, and gradually worn &s;mooth, by the poli&s;hing of fe|male conver&s;ation, and the refining of female ta&s;te; while the ideas of wo|men
<PB N="14" REF="19">acquire &s;trength and &s;olidity, by their a&s;&s;ociating with &s;en&s;ible, intel|ligent, and judicious men.</P>
<P>ON the whole, (even if fame be the object of pur&s;uit) is it not better to &s;ucceed as women, than to fail as men? To &s;hine, by walking honourably in the road which nature, cu&s;tom, and education &s;eem to have marked out, rather than to counteract them all, by moving awkwardly in a path diame|trically oppo&s;ite? To be good origi|nals, rather than bad imitators? In a word, to be excellent women, rather than indifferent men?</P>

<HEAD>ON DISSIPATION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>DOGLIE CERTE, ALLEGREZZE INCERTE!</Q>
<BIBL>PETRARCA.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS an argument in favour of mo|dern manners, it has been plead|ed, that the &s;ofter vices of Luxury and Di&s;&s;ipation, belong rather to gen|tle and yielding tempers, than to &s;uch as are rugged and ferocious: that they are vices which increa&s;e civili|zation,
<PB N="16" REF="21">and tend to promote refine|ment, and the cultivation of human|nity.</P>
<P>BUT this is an a&s;&s;ertion, the truth of which the experience of all ages contradicts. Nero was not le&s;s a ty|rant for being a fiddler: He <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Emperor Caligula.</NOTE> who wi&s;hed the whole Roman people had but one neck, that he might di&s;patch them at a blow, was him&s;elf the mo&s;t debauched man in Rome; and Sydney and Ru&s;&s;el were condemned to bleed under the mo&s;t barbarous, though mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated and voluptuous, reign that ever di&s;graced the annals of Britain.</P>
<P>THE love of di&s;&s;ipation is, I believe, allowed to be the reigning evil of the pre&s;ent day. It is an evil which many
<PB N="17" REF="22">content them&s;elves with regretting, without &s;eeking to redre&s;s. A di&s;&s;i|pated life is cen&s;ured in the very act of di&s;&s;ipation, and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed again&s;t at the card table, as in the pulpit.</P>
<P>THE lover of dancing cen&s;ures the amu&s;ements of the theatre for their dulne&s;s, and the game&s;ter blames them both for their levity. She, who&s;e whole &s;oul is &s;wallowed up in "<HI>opera exta|cies,"</HI> is a&s;toni&s;hed, that her acquaint|ance can &s;pend whole nights in prey|ing, like harpies, on the fortunes of their fellow-creatures; while the grave &s;ober &s;inner, who pa&s;&s;es her pale and anxious vigils, in this fa&s;hionable &s;ort of pillaging, is no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed how the other can wa&s;te her precious time in hearing &s;ounds for which &s;he has
<PB N="18" REF="23">no ta&s;te, in a language &s;he does not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, every one &s;eems convinced, that the evil &s;o much complained of does really exi&s;t &s;omewhere, though all are inwardly per&s;uaded that it is not with them&s;elves. All de&s;ire a general reformation, but few will li&s;ten to pro|po&s;als of particular amendment; the body mu&s;t be re&s;tored, but each limb begs to remain as it is; and accu&s;ations which concern all, will be likely to af|fect none. They think that &s;in, like matter, is divi&s;ible, and that what is &s;cattered among &s;o many, cannot ma|terially affect any one; and thus indi|viduals contribute &s;eparately to that evil which they in general lament.</P>
<P>THE prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or
<PB N="19" REF="24">are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the prin|cipal hinges on which the great ma|chine of human &s;ociety turns. Tho&s;e who allow the influence which female graces have, in contributing to poli&s;h the manners of men, would do well to reflect how great an influence fe|male morals mu&s;t al&s;o have on their conduct. How much then is it to be regretted, that the Briti&s;h ladies &s;hould ever &s;it down contented to poli&s;h, when they are able to reform, to entertain, when they might in&s;truct, and to daz|zle for an hour, when they are candi|dates for eternity!</P>
<P>UNDER the di&s;pen&s;ation of Maho|met's law, indeed, the&s;e mental ex|cellencies cannot be expected, becau&s;e the women are &s;hut out from all op|portunities of in&s;truction, and excluded
<PB N="20" REF="25">from the endearing plea&s;ures of a de|lightful and equal &s;ociety; and, as a charming poet &s;ings, are taught to believe, that
<Q><L>For their inferior natures</L>
<L>Form'd to delight, and happy by delighting,</L>
<L>Heav'n has re&s;erv'd no future paradi&s;e,</L>
<L>But bids them rove the paths of bli&s;s, &s;ecure</L>
<L>Of total death, and carele&s;s of herea&s;ter.</L>
<BIBL>IRENE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THESE act con&s;i&s;tently in &s;tudying none but exterior graces, in cultivat|ing only per&s;onal attractions, and in trying to lighten the intolerable bur|den of time, by the mo&s;t frivolous and vain amu&s;ements. They act in con&s;equence of their own blind be|lief, and the tyranny of their de&s;potic ma&s;ters; for they have neither the free|dom of a pre&s;ent choice, nor the pro|&s;pect of a future being.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26">BUT in this land of civil and reli|gious liberty, where there is as little de&s;poti&s;m exerci&s;ed over the minds, as over the per&s;ons of women, they have every liberty of choice, and every opportunity of improvement; and how greatly does this increa&s;e their obli|gation to be exemplary in their gene|ral conduct, attentive to the govern|ment of their families, and in&s;trumental to the good order of &s;ociety!</P>
<P>SHE who is at a lo&s;s to find amu&s;e|ments at home, can no longer apo|logize for her di&s;&s;ipation abroad, by &s;aying &s;he is deprived of the benefit and the plea&s;ure of books; and &s;he who regrets being doomed to a &s;tate of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the inju&s;tice, or tyranny of the men, com|plains of an evil which does not exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">IT is a que&s;tion frequently in the mouths of illiterate and di&s;&s;ipated fe|males&mdash; "What good is there in read|ing? To what end does it conduce?" It is, however, too obvious to need in|&s;i&s;ting on, that unle&s;s perverted, as the be&s;t things may be, reading an|&s;wers many excellent purpo&s;es be&s;ide the great leading one, and is perhaps the &s;afe&s;t remedy for di&s;&s;ipation. She who dedicates a portion of her lei&s;ure to u&s;eful reading, feels her mind in a con&s;tant progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of improve|ment, whil&s;t the mind of a di&s;&s;ipated woman is continually lo&s;ing ground. An active &s;pirit rejoiceth, like the &s;un, to run his daily cour&s;e, while indo|lence, like the dial of Ahaz, goes backwards. The advantages which the under&s;tanding receives from polite literature, it is not here nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate; its effects on the moral
<PB N="23" REF="28">temper is the pre&s;ent object of con&s;i|deration. The remark may perhaps be thought too &s;trong, but I believe it is true, that next to religious influ|ences, an habit of &s;tudy is the mo&s;t probable pre&s;ervative of the virtue of young per&s;ons. Tho&s;e who cultivate letters have rarely a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for promi&s;cuous vi&s;iting, or di&s;&s;ipated &s;o|ciety; &s;tudy therefore induces a reli&s;h for dome&s;tic life, the mo&s;t de&s;irable temper in the world for women. Stu|dy, as it re&s;cues the mind from an inordinate fondne&s;s for gaming, dre&s;s, and public amu&s;ements, is an oeco|nomical propen&s;ity; for a lady may read at much le&s;s expence than &s;he can play at cards; as it requires &s;ome ap|plication, it gives the mind an habit of indu&s;try; as it is a relief again&s;t that mental di&s;ea&s;e, which the French emphatically call <HI>ennui,</HI> it cannot fail
<PB N="24" REF="29">of being beneficial to the temper and &s;pirits, I mean in the moderate degree in which ladies are &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e it; as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a &s;ocial virtue; as it demands the full exertion of our talents, it grows a ra|tional duty; and when directed to the knowledge of the Supreme Being, and his laws, it ri&s;es into an act of reli|gion.</P>
<P>THE rage for reformation commonly &s;hews it&s;elf in a violent zeal for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing what is wrong, rather than in a prudent attention to e&s;tabli&s;h what is right; but we &s;hall never obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds, we mu&s;t al&s;o plant flowers; for the natural richne&s;s of the &s;oil we have been clearing will not &s;uffer it to lie barren, but whether it &s;hall be vainly or beneficially prolific, depends on the
<PB N="25" REF="30">culture. What the pre&s;ent age has gained on one &s;ide, by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking, &s;eems to be lo&s;t on the other, by exce&s;&s;ive free|dom and unbounded indulgence. Know|ledge is not, as heretofore, confined to the dull cloy&s;ter, or the gloomy college, but di&s;&s;eminated, to a cer|tain degree, among both &s;exes and almo&s;t all ranks. The only misfor|tune is, that the&s;e opportunities do not &s;eem to be &s;o wi&s;ely improved, or turned to &s;o good an account as might be wi&s;hed. Books of a pernicious, idle, and frivolous &s;ort, are too much multiplied, and it is from the very redundancy of them that true know|ledge is &s;o &s;carce, and the habit of di&s;&s;ipation &s;o much increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, that the pre|vailing character of the pre&s;ent age is
<PB N="26" REF="31">not that of gro&s;s immorality: but if this is meant of tho&s;e in the higher walks of life, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern, that there can be but little merit in ab&s;taining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit. It is however to be feared, that a gra|dual defection from piety, will in time draw after it all the bad con&s;e|quences of more active vice; for whe|ther mounds and fences are &s;uddenly de&s;troyed by a &s;weeping torrent, or worn away through gradual neglect, the effect is equally de&s;tructive. As a rapid fever and a con&s;uming hectic are alike fatal to our natural health, &s;o are flagrant immorality and torpid in|dolence to our moral well-being.</P>
<P>THE philo&s;ophical doctrine of the &s;low rece&s;&s;ion of bodies from the &s;un, is a lively image of the reluctance with
<PB N="27" REF="32">which we fir&s;t abandon the light of virtue. The beginning of folly, and the fir&s;t entrance on a di&s;&s;ipated life co&s;t &s;ome pangs to a well di&s;po&s;ed heart; but it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;he how &s;oon the progre&s;s cea&s;es to be impeded by reflection, or &s;lackened by remor&s;e. For it is in moral as in natural things, the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the centre to which they are tending. If we recede &s;lowly at fir&s;t &s;etting out, we advance rapidly in our future cour&s;e; and to have begun to be wrong, is already to have made a great progre&s;s.</P>
<P>A CONSTANT habit of amu&s;ement relaxes the tone of the mind, and ren|ders it totally incapable of application, &s;tudy, or virtue. Di&s;&s;ipation not only indi&s;po&s;es it votaries to every thing
<PB N="28" REF="33">u&s;eful and excellent, but di&s;qualifies them for the enjoyment of plea&s;ure it|&s;elf. It &s;oftens the &s;oul &s;o much, that the mo&s;t &s;uperficial employment be|comes a labour, and the &s;lighte&s;t in|convenience an agony. The luxurious Sybarite mu&s;t have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of real enjoyment, and all reli&s;h for true gratification, before he complained that he could not &s;leep, becau&s;e the ro&s;e leaves lay double under him.</P>
<P>LUXURY and di&s;&s;ipation, &s;oft and gentle as their approaches are, and &s;ilently as they throw their &s;ilken chains about the heart, en&s;lave it more than the mo&s;t active and turbulent vices. The mightie&s;t conquerors have been conquered by the&s;e unarmed foes: the flowery fetters are fa&s;tened, before they are felt. The blandi&s;hments of Circe were more fatal to the mariners of
<PB N="29" REF="34">Uly&s;&s;es, than the &s;trength of Poly|pheme, or the brutality of the Lae&s;|trigons. Hercules, after he had clean&s;ed the Augean &s;table, and per|formed all the other labours enjoined him by Euri&s;theus, found him&s;elf a &s;lave to the &s;oftne&s;&s;es of the heart; and he, who wore a club and a lion's &s;kin in the cau&s;e of virtue, conde|&s;cended to the mo&s;t effeminate employ|ments to gratify a criminal weakne&s;s. Hannibal, who vanqui&s;hed mighty nations, was him&s;elf overcome by the love of plea&s;ure; and he who de&s;pi&s;ed cold, and want, and danger, and death on the Alps, was conquered and un|done by the di&s;&s;olute indulgences of Capua.</P>
<P>BEFORE the hero of the mo&s;t beau|tiful and virtuous romance that ever was written, I mean Telemachus,
<PB N="30" REF="35">landed on the i&s;land of Cyprus, he un|fortunately lo&s;t his prudent compa|nion, Mentor, in whom wi&s;dom is &s;o finely per&s;oni&s;ied. At &s;ir&s;t he beheld with horror the wanton and di&s;&s;olute manners of the voluptuous inhabitants; the ill effects of their example were not immediate: he did not fall into the commi&s;&s;ion of glaring enormities; but his virtue was &s;ecretly and imper|ceptibly undermined, his heart was &s;oftened by their pernicious &s;ociety, and the nerve of re&s;olution was &s;lack|ened: he every day beheld with di|mini&s;hed indignation the wor&s;hip which was offered to Venus; the di&s;orders of luxury and prophanene&s;s became le&s;s and le&s;s terrible, and the infectious air of the country enfeebled his cou|rage, and relaxed his principles. In &s;hort, he had cea&s;ed to love virtue long before he thought of committing
<PB N="31" REF="36">actual vice; and the duties of a manly piety were burden&s;ome to him, before he was &s;o deba&s;ed as to offer perfumes, and burn incen&s;e on the altar of the licentious godde&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">NOTHING can be more admirable than the man|ner in which this allegory is conducted; and the whole work, not to mention its images, machinery, and other poetical beautics, is written in the very &s;ine&s;t &s;train of morality. In this latter re&s;pect it is evidently &s;uperior to the works of the ancients, the moral of which is frequently tainted by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their mythology. Something of the purity of the Chri&s;tian religion may be di&s;covered even in Fene|lon's heathens, and they catch a tincture of piety in pa&s;&s;ing through the hands of that amiable prelate</NOTE>,</P>
<P><Q>LET us crown our&s;elves with ro&s;e|buds before they be withered,</Q> &s;aid Solomon's libertine. Alas! he did not reflect that they withered in the very gathering. The ro&s;es of plea&s;ure &s;el|dom la&s;t long enough to adorn the brow
<PB N="32" REF="37">of him who plucks them; for they are the only ro&s;es which do not retain their &s;weetne&s;s after they have lo&s;t their beauty.</P>
<P>THE heathen poets often pre&s;&s;ed on their readers the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ider|ing the &s;hortne&s;s of life, as an incen|tive to plea&s;ure and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; le&s;t the &s;ea&s;on for indulging in them &s;hould pa&s;s unimproved. The dark and uncertain notions, not to &s;ay the ab&s;olute di&s;belief, which they enter|tained of a future &s;tate, is the only apology that can be offered for this rea&s;oning. But while we cen&s;ure their tenets, let us not adopt their errors; errors which would be infinitely more inexcu&s;able in us, who, from the clearer views which revelation has given us, &s;hall not have their igno|rance or their doubts to plead. It

<P>IF, indeed, like the mi&s;erable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Struldbrugs.

<P>THOSE who have not yet determined on the &s;ide of vanity, who, like Her|cules, (before he knew the queen of Lydia, and had learnt to &s;pin) have not re&s;olved on their choice between VIRTUE and PLEASURE, may reflect, that it is &s;till in their power to imitate that hero in his noble choice, and in his virtuous rejection. They may al&s;o reflect with grateful triumph, that Chri&s;tianity furni&s;hes them with a bet|ter guide than the tutor of Alcides,
<PB N="35" REF="40">and with a &s;urer light than the doc|trines of pagan philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>IT is far from my de&s;ign &s;everely to condemn the innocent plea&s;ures of life: I would only beg leave to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e which are criminal &s;hould never be allowed; and that even the mo&s;t innocent will, by immoderate u&s;e, &s;oon cea&s;e to be &s;o.</P>
<P>THE women of this country were not &s;ent into the world to &s;hun &s;ociety, but to embelli&s;h it; they were not de&s;igned for wilds and &s;oli|tudes, but for the amiable and endear|ing offices of &s;ocial life.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been advi&s;ed, and by very re&s;pectable authorities too, that in conver&s;ation women &s;hould carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I own, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that I do not &s;ee ei|ther the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of this
<PB N="38" REF="43">advice. For if a young lady has that di&s;cretion and mode&s;ty, without which all knowledge is little worth, &s;he will never make an o&s;tentatious parade of it, becau&s;e &s;he will rather be intent on acquiring more, than on di&s;playing what &s;he has.</P>
<P>I AM at a lo&s;s to know why a young female is in&s;tructed to exhibit, in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view, her &s;kill in mu&s;ic, her &s;inging, dancing, ta&s;te in dre&s;s, and her acquaintance with the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable games and amu&s;ements, while her piety is to be anxiou&s;ly concealed, and her knowledge affectedly di&s;avowed, le&s;t the former &s;hould draw on her the appellation of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, or the latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="44">IN regard to knowledge, why &s;hould &s;he for ever affect to be on her guard, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be found guilty of a &s;mall portion of it? She need be the le&s;s &s;olicitous about it, as it &s;eldom proves to be &s;o very con&s;iderable as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment or admiration: for, after all the acqui&s;itions which her talents and her &s;tudies have enabled her to make, &s;he will, generally &s;peak|ing, be found to have le&s;s of what is called <HI>learning,</HI> than a common &s;chool|boy.</P>
<P>IT would be to the la&s;t degree pre|&s;umptuous and ab&s;urd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <HI>ton</HI> to the company; to interrupt the plea&s;ure of others, and her own opportunity of improvement, by talking when &s;he ought to li&s;ten; or to introduce &s;ub|jects out of the common road, in or|der
<PB N="40" REF="45">to &s;hew her own wit, or expo&s;e the want of it in others: but were the &s;ex to be totally &s;ilent when any topic of literature happens to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their pre&s;ence, conver&s;ation would lo&s;e much of its vivacity, and &s;ociety would be robbed of one of its mo&s;t intere&s;ting charms.</P>
<P>How ea&s;ily and effectually may a well-bred woman promote the mo&s;t u&s;eful and elegant conver&s;ation, almo&s;t without &s;peaking a word! for the modes of &s;peech are &s;carcely more variable than the modes of &s;ilence. The &s;ilence of li&s;tle&s;s ignorance, and the &s;ilence of &s;parkling intelligence, are perhaps as &s;eparately marked, and as di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ed, as the &s;ame feelings could have been by the mo&s;t unequivocal language. A woman, in a company where &s;he has the lea&s;t influence, may
<PB N="41" REF="46">promote any &s;ubject by a profound and invariable attention, which &s;hews that &s;he is plea&s;ed with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves &s;he under&s;tands it. This obliging at|tention is the mo&s;t flattering encourage|ment in the world to men of &s;en&s;e and letters, to continue any topic of in|&s;truction or entertainment they happen to be engaged in: it owed its intro|duction perhaps to accident, the be&s;t introduction in the world for a &s;ubject of ingenuity, which, though it could not have been formally propo&s;ed with|out pedantry, may be continued with ea&s;e and good humour; but which will be frequently and effectually &s;top|ped by the li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, inattention, or whi&s;pering of &s;illy girls, who&s;e weari|ne&s;s betrays their ignorance, and who&s;e impatience expo&s;es their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply inte|re&s;ted
<PB N="42" REF="47">in the &s;ubject on which he is conver&s;ing, catches at the &s;lighte&s;t hint to have done: a look is a &s;ufficient intimation, and if a pretty &s;impleton, who &s;its near him, &s;eems <HI>di&s;traite,</HI> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the rea&s;onable part of the company, who perhaps might have gained more improvement by the con|tinuance of &s;uch a conver&s;ation, than a week's reading would have yielded them; for it is &s;uch company as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron &s;harpeneth iron."</P>
<P>THAT &s;ilence is one of the great arts of conver&s;ation is allowed by Cicero him&s;elf, who &s;ays, there is not only an art but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great mo|dern, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon.</NOTE>, in the following little anecdote from one of the ancients.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="48">WHEN many Grecian philo&s;ophers had a &s;olemn meeting before the am|ba&s;&s;ador of a foreign prince, each en|deavoured to &s;hew his parts by the brilliancy of his conver&s;ation, that the amba&s;&s;ador might have &s;omething to relate of the Grecian wi&s;dom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the lo|quacity of his companions, ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence; when the amba&s;&s;a|dor, turning to him, a&s;ked, <Q>But what have you to &s;ay, that I may report it?</Q> He made this laconic, but very pointed reply: <Q>Tell your king, that you have found one among the Greeks who knew how to be &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge&mdash;this is Wit, the mo&s;t cap|tivating, but the mo&s;t dreaded of all talents: the mo&s;t dangerous to tho&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="49">who have it, and the mo&s;t feared by tho&s;e who have it not. Though it is again&s;t all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abu&s;e this charming quality. He who is grown rich with|out it, in &s;afe and &s;ober dulne&s;s, &s;huns it as a di&s;ea&s;e, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The morali&s;t declaims again&s;t it as the &s;ource of irregularity, and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy it&s;elf, for he con&s;iders it as the parent of extravagance and beggary. The Cynic will a&s;k of what u&s;e it is? Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amu&s;ement and delightful recreation. A woman, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this quality, has received a mo&s;t dangerous pre&s;ent, perhaps not le&s;s &s;o than beauty it&s;elf: e&s;pecially it it be not &s;heathed in a temper peculi|arly
<PB N="45" REF="50">inoffen&s;ive, cha&s;ti&s;ed by a mo&s;t correct judgment, and re&s;trained by more prudence than falls to the com|mon lot.</P>
<P>THIS talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as Wit is the immediate property of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and learning is only an ac|quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more danger, that we &s;hould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</P>
<P>BUT Wit, like learning, is not near &s;o common a thing as is imagined. Let not therefore a young lady be alarmed at the acutene&s;s of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould mi&s;take pert|ne&s;s, flippancy, or imprudence, for this
<PB N="46" REF="51">brilliant quality, or imagine &s;he is witty, only becau&s;e &s;he is indi&s;creet. This is very frequently the ca&s;e, and this makes the name of wit &s;o cheap, while its real exi&s;tence is &s;o rare.</P>
<P>LEST the flattery of her acquaint|ance, or an over-weening opinion of her own qualifications, &s;hould lead &s;ome vain and petulant girl into a fal&s;e notion that &s;he has a great deal of wit, when &s;he has only a redundancy of animal &s;pirits, &s;he may not find it u&s;e|le&s;s to attend to the definition of this quality, by one who had as large a portion of it, as mo&s;t individuals could ever boa&s;t:
<Q><L>'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a je&s;t,</L>
<L>Admir'd with laughter at a fea&s;t,</L>
<L>Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,</L>
<L>The proo&s;s of wit for ever mu&s;t remain.</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="52">
Neither can that have any place,</L>
<L>At which a virgin hides her face;</L>
<L>Such dro&s;s the fire mu&s;t purge away; 'tis ju&s;t,</L>
<L>The author blu&s;h there, where the reader mu&s;t.</L>
<BIBL>COWLEY.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e who actually po&s;&s;e&s;s this rare talent, cannot be too ab&s;tinent in the u&s;e of it. It often makes admirers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant feature; and the unprotected and defencele&s;s &s;tate of womanhood calls for friend|&s;hip more than for admiration. She who does not de&s;ire friends has a &s;or|did and in&s;en&s;ible &s;oul; but &s;he who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity and a cold heart.</P>
<P>BUT to dwell only on the &s;ide of policy, a prudent woman, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of &s;ome ge|nius,
<PB N="48" REF="53">will &s;ufficiently maintain it, with|out keeping her faculties always on the &s;tretch to &s;ay <HI>good things.</HI> Nay, if reputation alone be her object, &s;he will gain a more &s;olid one by her for|bearance, as the wi&s;er part of her ac|quaintance will a&s;cribe it to the right motive, which is, not that &s;he has le&s;s wit, but that &s;he has more judgment.</P>
<P>THE fatal fondne&s;s for indulging a &s;pirit of ridicule, and the injurious and irreparable con&s;equences which &s;ome|times attend the <HI>too prompt reply,</HI> can never be too &s;eriou&s;ly or too &s;everely condemned. Not to offend, is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards plea&s;ing. To give pain is as much an offence again&s;t huma|nity, as again&s;t good breeding; and &s;urely it is as well to ab&s;tain from an action becau&s;e it is &s;inful, as becau&s;e it is unpolite. In company, young
<PB N="49" REF="54">ladies would do well before they &s;peak, to reflect, if what they are going to &s;ay may not di&s;tre&s;s &s;ome worthy per|&s;on pre&s;ent, by wounding them in their per&s;ons, families, connexions, or religious opinions. If they find it will touch them in either of the&s;e, I &s;hould advi&s;e them to &s;u&s;pect, that what they were going to &s;ay is not &s;o <HI>very</HI> good a thing as they at fir&s;t imagined. Nay, if even it was one of tho&s;e bright ideas, which <HI>Venus has im|bued with a fifth part of her nectar,</HI> &s;o much greater will be their merit in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, if there was a probabi|lity it might offend. Indeed, if they have the temper and prudence to make &s;uch a previous reflection, they will be more richly rewarded by their own in|ward triumph, at having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a lively but &s;evere remark, than they could have been with the di&s;&s;embled
<PB N="50" REF="55">applau&s;es of the whole company, who, with that complai&s;ant deceit, which good breeding too much authori&s;es, affect openly to admire what they &s;e|cretly re&s;olve never to forgive.</P>
<P>I HAVE always been delighted with the &s;tory of the little girl's eloquence, in one of the Children's Tales, who re|ceived from a friendly fairy the gift, that at every word &s;he uttered, pinks, ro&s;es, diamonds, and pearls, &s;hould drop from her mouth. The hidden moral appears to be this, that is was the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper which pro|duced this pretty fanciful effect: for when her malicious &s;i&s;ter de&s;ired the &s;ame gift from the good natured tiny Intelligence, the venom of her own heart converted it into poi&s;onous and loath&s;ome reptiles.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56">A MAN of &s;en&s;e and breeding will &s;ometimes join in the laugh, which has been rai&s;ed at his expence by an ill|natured repartee; but if it was very cutting, and one of tho&s;e &s;hocking &s;ort of truths, which as they can &s;carcely be pardoned even in private, ought never to be uttered in public, he does not laugh becau&s;e he is plea&s;ed, but becau&s;e he wi&s;hes to conceal how much he is hurt. As the &s;arca&s;m was uttered by a lady, &s;o far from &s;eeming to re|&s;ent it, he will be the fir&s;t to commend it; but notwith&s;tanding that, he will remember it as a trait of malice, when the whole company &s;hall have forgot|ten it as a &s;troke of wit. Women are &s;o far from being privileged by their &s;ex to &s;ay unhand&s;ome or cruel things, that it is this very circum&s;tance which renders them more intolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is
<PB N="52" REF="57">no relief to him who is wounded to reflect, that the hand which &s;hot it was a fair one.</P>
<P>MANY women, when they have a favourite point to gain, or an earne&s;t wi&s;h to bring any one over to their opi|nion, often u&s;e a very di&s;ingenuous method: they will &s;tate a ca&s;e ambi|guou&s;ly, and then avail them&s;elves of it, in whatever manner &s;hall be&s;t an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; leaving your mind in a &s;tate of indeci&s;ion as to their real meaning, while they triumph in the perplexity they have given you by the unfair conclu&s;ions they draw, from pre|mi&s;es equivocally &s;tated. They will al&s;o frequently argue from exceptions in&s;tead of rules, and are a&s;toni&s;hed when you are not willing to be con|tented with a prejudice, in&s;tead of a rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="58">IN a &s;en&s;ible company of both &s;exes, where women are not re&s;trained by any other re&s;erve than what their natu|ral mode&s;ty impo&s;es; and where the intimacy of all parties authori&s;es the utmo&s;t freedom of communication; &s;hould any one inquire what were the general &s;entiments on &s;ome particular &s;ubject, it will, I believe, commonly happen, that the ladies, who&s;e imagi|nations have kept pace with the narra|tion, have anticipated its end, and are ready to deliver their &s;entiments on it as &s;oon as it is fini&s;hed. While &s;ome of the male hearers, who&s;e minds were bu&s;ied in &s;ettling the propriety, com|paring the circum&s;tances, and examin|ing the con&s;i&s;tencies of what was &s;aid, are obliged to pau&s;e and di&s;criminate, before they think of an&s;wering No|thing is &s;o embarra&s;&s;ing as a variety of matter, and the conver&s;ation of women

<P>A MAN of deep reflection, if he does not keep up an intimate commerce with the world, will be &s;ometimes &s;o entangled in the intricacies of inten&s;e thought, that he will have the appear|ance of a confu&s;ed and perplexed ex|pre&s;&s;ion; while a &s;prightly woman will extricate her&s;elf with that lively and "ra&s;h dexterity," which will almo&s;t always plea&s;e, though it is very far from being always right. It is ea&s;ier to confound than to convince an oppo|nent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happine&s;s than truth in it. Many an excellent rea|&s;oner, well &s;killed in the theory of the &s;chools, has felt him&s;elf di&s;comfited by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the que&s;|tion
<PB N="55" REF="60">as can be conceived, has di&s;con|certed him more than the mo&s;t &s;tart|ling propo&s;ition, or the mo&s;t accurate chain of rea&s;oning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagoni&s;t, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was at|tended with the fulle&s;t demon&s;tration: &s;o true is it, that it is not always nece&s;|&s;ary to be right, in order to be ap|plauded.</P>
<P>BUT let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this fal&s;e ap|plau&s;e, which is given, not to her merit, but to her &s;ex: &s;he has not per|haps gained a victory, though &s;he may be allowed a triumph; and it &s;hould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her &s;trength but her weakne&s;s. It is worth while to di&s;cri|
<PB N="56" REF="61">minate between that applau&s;e, which is given from the complai&s;ance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</P>
<P>WHERE great &s;prightline&s;s is the na|tural bent of the temper, girls &s;hould endeavour to habituate them&s;elves to a cu&s;tom of ob&s;erving, thinking, and rea&s;oning. I do not mean, that they &s;hould devote them&s;elves to ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculation, or the &s;tudy of logic; but &s;he who is accu&s;tomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to rea|&s;on ju&s;tly and pertinently on common affairs, and judiciou&s;ly to deduce ef|fects from their cau&s;es, will be a better logician than &s;ome of tho&s;e who claim the name, becau&s;e they have &s;tudied the art: this is being <Q>learned with|out the rules;</Q> the be&s;t definition, perhaps, of that &s;ort of literature which
<PB N="57" REF="62">is propere&s;t for the &s;ex. That &s;pecies of knowledge, which appears to be the re&s;ult of reflection rather than of &s;ci|ence, &s;its peculiarly well on women. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though &s;he does not know a rule of Syntax, &s;carcely ever violates one; and who con&s;tructs every &s;entence &s;he utters, with more propriety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Ari&s;totle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare di&s;cour&s;e with the golden &s;hreds of Cicero and Virgil.</P>
<P>IT has been objected, and I fear with &s;ome rea&s;on, that female con|ver&s;ation is too frequently tinctured with a cen&s;orious &s;pirit, and that ladies are &s;eldom apt to di&s;cover much ten|derne&s;s for the errors of a fallen &s;i&s;ter.
<Q><PB N="58" REF="63">If it be &s;o, it is a grievous fault.</Q>
No arguments can ju&s;tify, no pleas can extenuate it. To in&s;ult over the mi|&s;eries of an unhappy creature is inhu|man, not to compa&s;&s;ionate them is un|chri&s;tian. The worthy part of the &s;ex always expre&s;s them&s;elves humanely on the failings of others, in propor|tion to their own undeviating good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot help remarking, that young women do not always care|fully di&s;tingui&s;h between running into the error of detraction, and its oppo|&s;ite extreme of indi&s;criminate applau&s;e. This proceeds from the fal&s;e idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong mu&s;t be right. Thus the dread of being only &s;u&s;pected of one fault makes them actually guilty of another. The de&s;ire of avoiding
<PB N="59" REF="64">the imputation of envy, impels them to be in&s;incere; and to e&s;tabli&s;h a reputation for &s;weetne&s;s of temper and genero&s;ity, they affect &s;ometimes to &s;peak of very indifferent characters with the mo&s;t extravagant applau&s;e. With &s;uch, the hyperbole is a favou|rite figure; and every degree of com|pari&s;on but the &s;uperlative is rejected, as cold and inexpre&s;&s;ive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and de&s;troys the weight of their opinion on other occa&s;ions; for people very &s;oon di&s;cover what de|gree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And tho&s;e of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the value of what it prai&s;es, than the celebrated painter mu&s;t have been at the judgment pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="60" REF="65">on his works by an ignorant &s;pectator, who, being a&s;ked what he thought of &s;uch and &s;uch very capital but very different pieces, cried out in an affect|ed rapture, "All alike! all alike!"</P>
<P>IT has been propo&s;ed to the young, as a maxim of &s;upreme wi&s;dom, to manage &s;o dexterou&s;ly in conver&s;ation, as to appear to be well acquainted with &s;ubjects, of which they are to|tally ignorant; and this, by affecting &s;ilence in regard to tho&s;e, on which they are known to excel.&mdash;But why coun&s;el this di&s;ingenuous fraud? Why add to the numberle&s;s arts of deceit, this practice of deceiving, as it were, on a &s;ettled principle? If to di&s;avow the knowledge they really have be a culpable affectation, then certainly to in&s;inuate an idea of their &s;kill, where
<PB N="61" REF="66">they are actually ignorant, is a mo&s;t unworthy artifice.</P>
<P>BUT of all the qualifications for conver&s;ation, humility, if not the mo&s;t brilliant, is the &s;afe&s;t, the mo&s;t amiable, and the mo&s;t feminine. The affectation of introducing &s;ubjects, with which others are unacquainted, and of di&s;playing talents &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the company, is as dange|rous as it is fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>THERE are many, who never can forgive another for being more agree|able and more accompli&s;hed than them&s;elves, and who can pardon any offence rather than an eclip&s;ing me|rit. Had the nightingale in the fa|ble conquered his vanity, and re&s;i&s;ted the temptation of &s;hewing a fine voice,
<PB N="62" REF="67">he might have e&s;caped the talons of the hawk. The melody of his &s;inging was the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity co&s;t him his life.</P>

<P>"ENVY, (&s;ays Lord Bacon) has no holidays." There cannot perhaps be a more lively and &s;triking de&s;cription of the mi&s;erable &s;tate of mind tho&s;e endure, who are tormented
<PB N="64" REF="69">with this vice. A &s;pirit of emulation has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ource of the greate&s;t improvements; and there is no doubt but the warme&s;t rival&s;hip will produce the mo&s;t excellent effects; but it is to be feared, that a perpetual &s;tate of conte&s;t will injure the temper &s;o e&s;&s;entially, that the mi&s;chief will hardly be counterbalanced by any other advantages. Tho&s;e, who&s;e pro|gre&s;s is the mo&s;t rapid, will be apt to de&s;pi&s;e their le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful competi|tors, who, in return, will feel the bit|tere&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t their more fortunate rivals. Among per&s;ons of real goodne&s;s, this jealou&s;y and con|tempt can never be equally felt, be|cau&s;e every advancement in piety will be attended with a proportionable in|crea&s;e of humility, which will lead them to contemplate their own improve|ments
<PB N="65" REF="70">with mode&s;ty, and to view with charity the mi&s;carriages of others.</P>
<P>WHEN an envious man is melan|choly, one may a&s;k him, in the words of Bion, what evil has befallen him|&s;elf, or what good has happened to another? This la&s;t is the &s;cale by which he principally mea&s;ures his feli|city, and the very &s;miles of his friends are &s;o many deductions from his own happine&s;s. The wants of others are the &s;tandard by which he rates his own wealth, and he e&s;timates his riches, not &s;o much by his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as by the nece&s;&s;ities of his neigh|bours.</P>
<P>WHEN the malevolent intend to &s;trike a very deep and dangerous &s;troke of malice, they generally begin the mo&s;t remotely in the world from
<PB N="66" REF="71">the &s;ubject neare&s;t their hearts. They &s;et out with commending the object of their envy for &s;ome trifling quality or advantage, which it is &s;carcely worth while to po&s;&s;e&s;s: they next proceed to make a general profe&s;&s;ion of their own good-will and regard for him: thus artfully removing any &s;u&s;picion of their de&s;ign, and clearing all ob&s;truc|tions for the in&s;idious &s;tab they are about to give; for who will &s;u&s;pect them of an intention to injure the ob|ject of their peculiar and profe&s;&s;ed e&s;teem? The hearer's belief of the fact grows in proportion to the &s;eem|ing reluctance with which it is told, and to the conviction he has, that the relater is not influenced by any private pique, or per&s;onal re&s;entment; but that the confe&s;&s;ion is extorted from him &s;orely again&s;t his inclination, and purely on account of his zeal for truth.</P>

The rage of the pa&s;|&s;ionate man is totally extingui&s;hed by the death of his enemy; but the ha|tred
<PB N="70" REF="75">of the malicious is not buried even in the grave of his rival: he will envy the good name he has left behind him; he will envy him the tears of his wi|dow, the pro&s;perity of his children, the e&s;teem of his friends, the prai&s;es of his epitaph&mdash;nay the very magnifi|cence of his funeral.</P>
<P>"THE ear of jealou&s;y heareth all things," (&s;ays the wi&s;e man) frequently I believe more than is uttered, which makes the company of per&s;ons in|fected with it &s;till more dangerous.</P>
<P>WHEN you tell tho&s;e of a malicious turn, any circum&s;tance that has hap|pened to another, though they per|fectly know of whom you are &s;peak|ing, they often affect to be at a lo&s;s, to forget his name, or to mi&s;apprehend you in &s;ome re&s;pect or other; and this
<PB N="71" REF="76">merely to have an opportunity of &s;lily gratifying their malice by mentioning &s;ome unhappy defect or per&s;onal infir|mity he labours under; and not con|tented "to tack his every error to his name," they will, by way of farther explanation, have recour&s;e to the faults of his father, or the misfortunes of his family; and this with all the &s;eem|ing &s;implicity and candor in the world, merely for the &s;ake of preventing mi&s;|takes, and to clear up every doubt of his identity.&mdash;If you are &s;peaking of a lady, for in&s;tance, they will perhaps embelli&s;h their inquiries, by a&s;king if you mean her, who&s;e great grandfather was a bankrupt, though &s;he has the vanity to keep a chariot, while others who are much better born walk on foot; or they will afterwards recollect, that you may po&s;&s;ibly mean her cou&s;in, of the &s;ame name, who&s;e mother was

<P>To <HI>hint at a fault,</HI> does more mi&s;|chief than &s;peaking out; for whatever is left for the imagination to fini&s;h, will not fail to be overdone: every hiatus will be more then filled up, and every pau&s;e more than &s;upplied. There is le&s;s malice, and le&s;s mi&s;chief too, in telling a man's name than the ini|tials of it; as a worthier per&s;on may be involved in the mo&s;t di&s;graceful &s;u&s;picions by &s;uch a dangerous ambi|guity.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon for the envi|ous, after having attempted to deface the faire&s;t character &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly, that they are afraid you will begin to
<PB N="73" REF="78">detect their malice, to endeavour to remove your &s;u&s;picions effectually, by a&s;&s;uring you, that what they have ju&s;t related is only the popular opinion; they them&s;elves can never believe things are &s;o bad as they are &s;aid to be; for their part, it is a rule with them always to hope the be&s;t. It is their way never to believe or report ill of any one. They will, however, mention the &s;tory in all companies, that they may do their friend the &s;er|vice of prote&s;ting their di&s;belief of it. More reputations are thus hinted away by fal&s;e friends, than are openly de|&s;troyed by public enemies. An <HI>if,</HI> or a <HI>but,</HI> or a mortified look, or a lan|guid defence, or an ambiguous &s;hake of the head, or a ha&s;ty word affectedly recalled, will demoli&s;h a character more effectually, than the whole artillery of malice when openly levelled again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="79">IT is not that envy never prai&s;es&mdash; No, that would be making a public profe&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf, and adverti&s;ing its own malignity; whereas the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end. When envy intends to &s;trike a &s;troke of Machiave|lian policy, it &s;ometimes affects the language of the mo&s;t exaggerated ap|plau&s;e; though it generally takes care, that the &s;ubject of its panegyric &s;hall be a very indifferent and common cha|racter, &s;o that it is well aware none of its prai&s;es will &s;tick.</P>
<P>IT is the unhappy nature of envy not to be contented with po&s;itive mi|&s;ery, but to be continually aggra|vating its own torments, by compar|ing them with the felicities of others. The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed on the object which di&s;turbs it, nor
<PB N="75" REF="80">can it avert them from it, though to procure it&s;elf the relief of a tempo|rary forgetfulne&s;s. On &s;eeing the in|nocence of the fir&s;t pair,

<L>For Envy, yet with jealous leer malign,</L>
<L>Eyed them a&s;kance.</L></Q></P>
<P>As this enormous &s;in chiefly in&s;ti|gated the revolt, and brought on the ruin of the angelic &s;pirits, &s;o it is not improbable, that it will be a principal in&s;trument of mi&s;ery in a future world, for the envious to compare their de&s;|perate condition with the happine&s;s of the children of God; and to heighten their actual wretchedne&s;s by reflecting on what they have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>PERHAPS envy, like lying and in|gratitude, is practi&s;ed with more fre|quency, becau&s;e it is practi&s;ed with
<PB N="76" REF="81">impunity; but there being no human laws again&s;t the&s;e crimes, is &s;o far from an inducement to commit them, that this very con&s;ideration would be &s;uf|ficient to deter the wi&s;e and good, if all others were ineffectual; for of how heinous a nature mu&s;t tho&s;e &s;ins be, which are judged above the reach of human puni&s;hment, and are re&s;erved for the final ju&s;tice of God him&s;elf!</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent age may be termed, by way of di&s;tinction, the age of &s;enti|timent, a word which, in the impli|cation it now bears, was unknown to our plain ance&s;tors.

<P>ERROR is never likely to do &s;o much mi&s;chief as when it di&s;guifes its real tendency, and puts on an engag|ing and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be &s;hock|ed at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a &s;entimental connexion, though perhaps with a dangerous and de&s;igning man, who, by putting on this ma&s;k of plau|&s;ibility and virtue, di&s;arms her of her prudence, lays her apprehen&s;ions a&s;leep, and involves her in mi&s;ery; mi&s;ery the more inevitable becau&s;e un&s;u&s;pect|ed.

<P>SUCH an engagement will be infi|nitely dearer to her vanity than an avowed and authori&s;ed attachment; for one of the&s;e &s;entimental lovers will not &s;cruple very &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;&s;ure a cre|dulous girl, that her unparalleled me|rit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world, and that the univer&s;al homage of mankind is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms. No wonder then &s;he &s;hould be ea&s;ily prevailed on to be|lieve, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might en&s;lave a million. But &s;he &s;hould remember, that he who endeavours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day mo&s;t effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a &s;ecret de|&s;ign
<PB N="81" REF="86">to pay him&s;elf in future for every pre&s;ent &s;acrifice. And this prodigality of prai&s;e, which he now appears to lavi&s;h with &s;uch thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion, is, in fact, a &s;um oeconomically laid out to &s;upply his future nece&s;&s;ities: of this &s;um he keeps an exact e&s;timate, and at &s;ome di&s;tant day promi&s;es him|&s;elf the mo&s;t exorbitant intere&s;t for it.

Indeed, it is more than probable &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of them before, hav|ing gradually acquired them in her initiation into the &s;entimental charac|ter.

<P>A SENTIMENTAL girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her per&s;onal beauty; for &s;he has been daily accu&s;|tomed to contemplate it her&s;elf, and to hear of it from others. She will not, therefore, be very &s;olicitous for

That wealth, which lately &s;eemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal at|traction in the eyes of the hu&s;band; and he, who but a few &s;hort weeks before, in a tran&s;port of &s;entimental genero&s;ity, wi&s;hed her to have been a village maid, with no portion but

<Q>An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,</Q>
is &s;hocked to find her&s;elf at once &s;trip|ped of all her cele&s;tial attributes. This late divinity, who &s;carcely yielded to her &s;i&s;ters of the &s;ky, now finds her|&s;elf of le&s;s importance in the e&s;teem of the man &s;he has cho&s;en, than any other mere mortal woman. No longer is &s;he gratified with the tear of coun|terfeited pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;igh of di&s;&s;embled rapture, or the language of premedi|tated adoration. No longer is the
<PB N="87" REF="92">altar of her vanity loaded with the ob|lations of fictitious fondne&s;s, the in|cen&s;e of fal&s;ehood, or the &s;acrifice of flattery.&mdash;Her apotheo&s;is is ended!&mdash; She feels her&s;elf degraded from the dignities and privileges of a godde&s;s, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weakne&s;&s;es of a &s;lighted woman, and a neglected wife. Her faults, which were &s;o lately overlooked, or mi&s;taken for virtues, are now, as Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ays, &s;et in a note-book. The pa&s;&s;ion, which was vowed eternal, la&s;ted only a few &s;hort weeks; and the indiffe|rence, which was &s;o far from being included in the bargain, that it was not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, follows them through the whole tire&s;ome journey of their in&s;ipid, vacant, joyle&s;s exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THUS much for the <HI>completion</HI> of the &s;entimental hi&s;tory. If we trace it
<PB N="88" REF="93">back to its beginning, we &s;hall &s;ind that a dam&s;el of this ca&s;t had her head originally turned by pernicious read|ing, and her in&s;anity confirmed by imprudent friend&s;hips. She never fails to &s;elect a beloved <HI>confidante</HI> of her own turn and humour, though, if &s;he can help it, not quite &s;o hand&s;ome as her&s;elf. A violent intimacy en&s;ues, or, to &s;peak the language of &s;entiment, an intimate union of &s;ouls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the highe&s;t pitch by a &s;ecret and volumi|nous corre&s;pondence, though they live in the &s;ame &s;treet, or perhaps in the &s;ame hou&s;e. This is the fuel which principally feeds and &s;upplies the dan|gerous flame of &s;entiment. In this corre&s;pondence the two friends encou|rage each other in the fal&s;e&s;t notions imaginable. They repre&s;ent romantic love as the great important bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="89" REF="94">of human life, and de&s;cribe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of &s;uch elevated beings, and fit only to em|ploy the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In the&s;e letters, family affairs are mi&s;repre&s;ented, family &s;ecrets di|vulged, and family misfortunes ag|gravated. They are filled with vows of eternal amity, and prote&s;tations of never-ending love. But interjections and quotations are the principal em|belli&s;hments of the&s;e very &s;ublime epi&s;tles. Every panegyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbo|lical, and every cen&s;ure exaggerated and exce&s;&s;ive. In a favourite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe degraded into a crime. The dramatic poets, e&s;pecially the mo&s;t tender and romantic, are quoted in almo&s;t every line, and every pom|pous
<PB N="90" REF="95">or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and obvious mean|ing, and with all the violence of mi&s;|application, is compelled to &s;uit &s;ome circum&s;tance of imaginary woe of the fair tran&s;criber.

<P>FATHERS <HI>have flinty hearts</HI> is an ex|pre&s;&s;ion worth an empire, and is al|ways u&s;ed with peculiar empha&s;is and enthu&s;ia&s;m. For a favourite topic of the&s;e epi&s;tles is the groveling &s;pirit and &s;ordid temper of the parents, who will be &s;ure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters, &s;hould they pre&s;ume to be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to direct their cour&s;e of reading, interfere in their choice of friends, or interrupt their very important corre&s;pondence. But as the&s;e young ladies are fertile in But as the&s;e young ladies are fertile in
<PB N="91" REF="96">expedients, and as their genius is ne|ver more agreeably exerci&s;ed than in finding re&s;ources, they are not with|out their &s;ecret exultation, in ca&s;e ei|ther of the above intere&s;ting events &s;hould happen, as they carry with them a certain air of tyranny and per|&s;ecution which is very delightful. For a prohibited corre&s;pondence is one of the great incidents of a &s;entimental life, and a letter clande&s;tinely received, the &s;upreme felicity of a &s;entimental lady.</P>
<P>NOTHING can equal the a&s;toni&s;hment of the&s;e &s;oaring &s;pirits, when their plain friends or prudent relations pre|&s;ume to remon&s;trate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if the&s;e worthy people happen to be &s;omewhat advanced in life, their con|tempt is then a little &s;oftened by pity, at the reflection that &s;uch very anti|quated
<PB N="92" REF="97">poor creatures &s;hould pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement, &s;en&s;e, and reading. They con&s;ider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the &s;ublime plea|&s;ures of a delicate and exalted pa&s;&s;ion; as tyrants who&s;e authority is to be con|temned, and as &s;pies who&s;e vigilance is to be eluded. The prudence of the&s;e worthy friends they term &s;u&s;picion, and their experience dotage. For they are per&s;uaded, that the face of things has &s;o totally changed &s;ince their pa|rents were young, that though they might then judge tolerably for them|&s;elves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of knowledge and ob&s;ervation) by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daugh|ters; who, if they have made a great progre&s;s in the &s;entimental walk, will
<PB N="93" REF="98">no more be influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pinner or her bro|cade &s;uit.</P>
<P>BUT young people never &s;hew their folly and ignorance more con&s;picu|ou&s;ly, than by this over-confidence in their own judgment, and this haughty di&s;dain of the opinion of tho&s;e who have known more days. Youth has a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which it is very apt to mi&s;take for an acutene&s;s of penetration. But youth, like cun|ning, though very conceited, is very &s;hort-&s;ighted, and never more &s;o than when it di&s;regards the in&s;tructions of the wi&s;e, and the admonitions of the aged. The &s;ame vices and follies in|fluenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and
<PB N="94" REF="99">nearly in the &s;ame manner. One who well knew the world and its various vanities, has &s;aid, <Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which &s;hall be, and that which is done is that which &s;hall be done, and there is no new thing under the &s;un.</Q></P>
<P>IT is al&s;o a part of the &s;entimental character, to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, or even to the common benefits and ble&s;&s;|ings of life. Ladies of this turn al&s;o affect the mo&s;t lofty di&s;regard for u&s;e|ful qualities and dome&s;tic virtues; and this is a natural con&s;equence: for as this &s;ort of &s;entiment is only a weed of idlene&s;s, &s;he who is con&s;tantly and u&s;efully employed, has neither lei&s;ure nor propen&s;ity to cultivate it.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="100">A SENTIMENTAL lady principally values her&s;elf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of thinking. This &s;uperiority of &s;oul chiefly manife&s;ts it&s;elf in the contempt of tho&s;e minute delicacies and little de|corums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to re&s;train the levity of the younger part of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the error here complained of, originates in mi&s;taking <HI>&s;entiment</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely diffe|rent. Sentiment is the virtue of <HI>ideas,</HI> and principle the virtue of <HI>action.</HI> Sen|timent has its &s;eat in the head, prin|ciple in the heart. Sentiment &s;ugge&s;ts fine harangues and &s;ubtile di&s;tinctions; principle conceives ju&s;t notions, and performs good actions in con&s;equence
<PB N="96" REF="101">of them. Sentiment refines away the &s;implicity of truth and the plainne&s;s of piety; and, as a celebrated wit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Rou&s;&s;eau.</NOTE> has remarked of his no le&s;s celebrated contemporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds.

<P>BUT the&s;e qualities will be better exemplified by an attentive con&s;ider|ation of two admirably drawn cha|racters of Milton, which are beauti|fully, delicately, and di&s;tinctly mark|ed.

<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding I have &s;poken with &s;ome a&s;perity again&s;t &s;entiment as oppo&s;ed to principle, yet I am con|vinced,
<PB N="101" REF="106">that true genuine &s;entiment, (not the &s;ort I have been de&s;cribing) may be &s;o connected with principle, as to be&s;tow on it its brighte&s;t lu&s;tre, and its mo&s;t captivating graces. And enthu&s;ia&s;m is &s;o far from being di&s;a|greeable, that a portion of it is per|haps indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in an en|gaging woman. But it mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the heart, not of the &s;en&s;es. It mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cheri&s;hed by a virtuous education; not that which is compounded of irregular pa&s;&s;ions, and artificially refined by books of unna|tural fiction and improbable adven|ture. I will even go &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatne&s;s of &s;oul, or true elevation of principle, if &s;he has not a tincture of what the vulgar would call Ro|mance, but which per&s;ons of a certain
<PB N="102" REF="107">way of thinking will di&s;cern to pro|ceed from tho&s;e fine feelings, and that charming &s;en&s;ibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet &s;he can never be amiable.</P>
<P>BUT this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it into incon|veniencies from which le&s;s intere&s;ting characters are happily exempt. Young women of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility may be carried by the very amiablene&s;s of this temper into the mo&s;t alarming ex|tremes. Their ta&s;tes are pa&s;&s;ions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and &s;carcely &s;uffer them&s;elves to feel a rea|&s;onable preference before it &s;trengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>WHEN an innocent girl of this open, tru&s;ting, tender heart, happens to meet
<PB N="103" REF="108">with one of her own &s;ex and age, who&s;e addre&s;s and manners are engag|ing, &s;he is in&s;tantly &s;eized with an ar|dent de&s;ire to commence a friend&s;hip with her. She feels the mo&s;t lively impatience at the re&s;traints of compa|ny, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to a&s;&s;ure her of the warmth of her ten|derne&s;s, and generou&s;ly a&s;cribes to the fair &s;tranger all the good qualities &s;he feels in her own heart, or rather all tho&s;e which &s;he has met with in her reading, di&s;per&s;ed in a variety of hero|ines. She is per&s;uaded, that her new friend unites them all in her&s;elf, be|cau&s;e &s;he carries in her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing countenance the promi&s;e of them all. How cruel and how cen&s;orious would this inexperienced girl think her mo|ther was, who &s;hould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had de|fects
<PB N="104" REF="109">in her temper, or exceptions in her character. She would mi&s;take the&s;e hints of di&s;cretion for the in&s;inuations of an uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition. At fir&s;t &s;he would perhaps li&s;ten to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and &s;ilent di&s;dain. She would de&s;pi&s;e them as the effect of prejudice, mi&s;repre&s;entation, or igno|rance. The more aggravated the cen|&s;ure, the more vehemently would &s;he prote&s;t in &s;ecret, that her friend&s;hip for this dear injured creature (who is rai&s;ed much higher in her e&s;teem by &s;uch injurious &s;u&s;picions) &s;hall know no bounds, as &s;he is a&s;&s;ured it can know no end.</P>
<P>YET this tru&s;ting con&s;idence, this hone&s;t indi&s;cretion, is, at this early pe|riod of life as amiable as it is natural; and will, if wi&s;ely cultivated, produce,
<PB N="105" REF="110">at its proper &s;ea&s;on, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circum&s;pection of premature, and therefore artificial, prudence. Men, I believe, are &s;eldom &s;truck with the&s;e &s;udden prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of each other. They are not &s;o un&s;u&s;pecting, nor &s;o ea&s;ily led away by the predomi|nance of fancy. They engage more warily, and pa&s;s through the &s;everal &s;tages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by &s;lower gradations; but women, if they are &s;ometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of &s;atisfaction than if they never tru&s;ted. For to be always clad in the burthen&s;ome ar|mour of &s;u&s;picion is more painful and inconvenient, than to run the hazard of &s;uffering now and then a tran&s;ient injury.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="111">BUT the above ob&s;ervations only extend to the young and the inexpe|rienced; for I am very certain, that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friend&s;hip as any of the other &s;ex. They can enter not only into all the enthu&s;ia&s;tic tenderne&s;s, but into all the &s;olid fidelity of attach|ment. And if we cannot oppo&s;e in|&s;tances of equal weight with tho&s;e of Ny&s;us and Euryalus, The&s;eus and Pi|rithous, Pylades and Ore&s;tes, let it be remembered, that it is becau&s;e the re|corders of tho&s;e characters were men, and that the very exi&s;tence of them is merely poetical.</P>

<P>A LOW voice and &s;oft addre&s;s are the common indications of a well-bred woman, and &s;hould &s;eem to be the natural effects of a meek and quiet &s;pirit; but they are only the outward and vi&s;ible &s;igns of it: for
<PB N="108" REF="113">they are no more meekne&s;s it&s;elf, than a red coat is courage, or a black one devotion.</P>
<P>YET nothing is more common than to mi&s;take the &s;ign for the thing it&s;elf; nor is any practice more frequent than that of endeavouring to acquire the exterior mark, without once thinking to labour after the interior grace. Surely this is beginning at the wrong end, like attacking the &s;ymptom and neg|lecting the di&s;ea&s;e. To regulate the features, while the &s;oul is in tumults, or to command the voice while the pa&s;&s;ions are without re&s;traint, is as idle as throwing odours into a &s;tream when the &s;ource is polluted.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;apient king,</HI> who knew better than any man the nature and the power of beauty, has a&s;&s;ured us, that the

<P>IT will not be difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the true from the artificial meekne&s;s. The former is univer&s;al and habitual, the latter, local and temporary. Every young female may keep this rule by her, to enable her to form a ju&s;t judg|ment of her own temper: if &s;he is not as gentle to her chambermaid as &s;he is to her vi&s;itor, &s;he may re&s;t &s;atisfied that the &s;pirit of gentlene&s;s is not in her.</P>

<P>THE countenance and manners of &s;ome very fa&s;hionable per&s;ons may be compared to the in&s;criptions on their monuments, which &s;peak nothing but good of what is within; but he who knows any thing of the world, or of the human heart, will no more tru&s;t to the courte&s;y, than he will depend on the epitaph.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="118">AMONG the various artifices of fac|titious meekne&s;s, one of the mo&s;t fre|quent and mo&s;t plau&s;ible, is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all per&s;ons and all characters.

<P>THESE uniformly &s;miling and ap|proving ladies, who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to bear their ho|ne&s;t te&s;timony in the cau&s;e of virtue, conclude every one to be ill-natured who has any penetration, and look up|on a di&s;tingui&s;hing judgment as want of tenderne&s;s. But they &s;hould learn,
<PB N="114" REF="119">that this di&s;cernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper, but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, which lead tho&s;e who have it to &s;cru|tinize into the conduct and di&s;po&s;ition of men, before they tru&s;t entirely to tho&s;e fair appearances, which &s;ome|times veil the mo&s;t in&s;idious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>WE are perpetually mi&s;taking the qualities and di&s;po&s;itions of our own hearts. We elevate our failings into virtues, and qualify our vices into weakne&s;&s;es: and hence ari&s;e &s;o many fal&s;e judgments re&s;pecting meekne&s;s. Self-ignorance is at the root of all this mi&s;chief. Many ladies complain that, for their part, their &s;pirit is &s;o meek they can bear nothing; whereas, if they &s;poke truth, they would &s;ay, their &s;pirit is &s;o high and unbroken that
<PB N="115" REF="120">they can bear nothing. Strange! to plead their meekne&s;s as a rea&s;on why they cannot endure to be cro&s;&s;ed, and to produce their impatience of contra|diction as a proof of their gentlene&s;s!</P>
<P>MEEKNESS, like mo&s;t other virtues, has certain limits, which it no &s;ooner exceeds than it becomes criminal. Ser|vility of &s;pirit is not gentlene&s;s but weakne&s;s, and if allowed, under the &s;pecious appearances it &s;ometimes puts on, will lead to the mo&s;t dangerous compliances. She who hears inno|cence maligned without vindicating it, fal&s;ehood a&s;&s;erted without contradict|ing it, or religion prophaned without re&s;enting it, is not gentle but wicked.</P>
<P>To give up the cau&s;e of an innocent, injured friend, if the popular cry hap|pens to be again&s;t him, is the mo&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="121">di&s;graceful weakne&s;s. This was the ca&s;e of Madame de Maintenon. She loved the character and admired the talents of Racine; &s;he care&s;&s;ed him while he had no enemies, but wanted the greatne&s;s of mind, or rather the common ju&s;tice, to protect him again&s;t the greatne&s;s of mind, or rather the common ju&s;tice, to protect him again&s;t their re&s;entment when he had; and her favourite was abandoned to the &s;u&s;picious jealou&s;y of the king, when a prudent remon&s;trance might have pre&s;erved him.&mdash;But her tamene&s;s, if not ab&s;olute connivance in the great ma&s;&s;acre of the prote&s;tants, in who&s;e church &s;he had been bred, is a far more guilty in&s;tance of her weakne&s;s; an in&s;tance which, in &s;pite of all her devotional zeal and incomparable pru|dence, will di&s;qualify her from &s;hining in the annals of good women, how|ever &s;he may be entitled to figure among the great and the fortunate.
<PB N="117" REF="122">Compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and contemporary, Bougi, who, when Louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commi&s;|&s;ion or a government, nobly replied, <Q>If I could be per&s;uaded to betray my God for a mar&s;hal's &s;taff, I might betray my king for a bribe of much le&s;s con&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P>MEEKNESS is imperfect, if it be not both active and pa&s;&s;ive; if it will not enable us to &s;ubdue our own pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entments, as well as qualify us to bear patiently the pa&s;&s;ions and re|&s;entments of others.</P>
<P>BEFORE we give way to any violent emotion of anger, it would perhaps be worth while to con&s;ider the value of the object which excites it, and to re|flect
<PB N="118" REF="123">for a moment, whether the thing we &s;o ardently de&s;ire, or &s;o vehemently re&s;ent, be really of as much import|ance to us, as that delightful tran|quillity of &s;oul, which we renounce in pur&s;uit of it. If, on a fair calculation, we find we are not likely to get as much as we are &s;ure to lo&s;e, then, putting all religious con&s;iderations out of the que&s;tion, common &s;en&s;e and human policy will tell us, we have made a fooli&s;h and unprofitable ex|change. Inward quiet is a part of one's &s;elf; the object of our re&s;entment may be only a matter of opinion; and, certainly, what makes a portion of our actual happine&s;s ought to be too dear to us, to be &s;acrificed for a tri|fling, foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t pointed &s;atire I remember to have read, on a mind en&s;laved by
<PB N="119" REF="124">anger, is an ob&s;ervation of Seneca's. <Q>Alexander (&s;aid he) had two friends, Clitus and Ly&s;imachus; the one he expo&s;ed to a lion, the other to him|&s;elf: he who was turned loo&s;e to the bea&s;t e&s;caped, but Clitus was mur|dered, for he was turned loo&s;e to an angry man.</Q></P>
<P>A PASSIONATE woman's happine&s;s is never in her own keeping: it is the &s;port of accident, and the &s;lave of events. It is in the power of her ac|quaintance, her &s;ervants, but chiefly of her enemies, and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others. So far from being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly, &s;he con&s;iders meekne&s;s as the want of a becoming &s;pirit, and lowline&s;s as a de&s;picable and vulgar meanne&s;s. And an impe|rious woman will &s;o little covet the
<PB N="120" REF="125">ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, that it is almo&s;t the only ornament &s;he will not be &s;olicitous to wear. But re|&s;entment is a very expen&s;ive vice. How dearly has it co&s;t its votaries, even from the &s;in of Cain, the fir&s;t offender in this kind! <Q>It is cheaper (&s;ays a pious writer) to forgive, and &s;ave the charges.</Q></P>
<P>IF it were only for mere human rea|&s;ons, it would turn to a better account to be patient; nothing defeats the ma|lice of an enemy like a &s;pirit of for|bearance; the return of rage for rage cannot be &s;o effectually provoking. True gentlene&s;s, like an impenetrable armour, repels the mo&s;t pointed &s;hafts of malice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable &s;hield, but either fall hurtle&s;s to the ground, or return to wound the hand that &s;hot them.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="126">A MEEK &s;pirit will not look out of it|&s;elf for happine&s;s, becau&s;e it finds a con&s;tant banquet at home; yet, by a &s;ort of divine alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce &s;ome good, even from the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing: it will ex|tract comfort and &s;atisfaction from the mo&s;t barren circum&s;tances: <Q>It will &s;uck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the &s;upreme excellence of this complacent quality is, that it naturally di&s;po&s;es the mind where it re&s;ides, to the practice of every other that is ami|able. Meekne&s;s may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which levels every ob&s;truction, and &s;mooths every difficulty that might impede their entrance, or retard their progre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="127">THE peculiar importance and value of this amiable virtue may be farther &s;een in its permanency.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE CULTIVATION OF THE HEART AND TEMPER IN THE EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not the fooli&s;h pre&s;ump|tion to imagine, that I can offer any thing new on a &s;ubject, which has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully treated by many learned and able writers. I would only, with all po&s;&s;ible deference, beg
<PB N="124" REF="129">leave to hazard a few &s;hort remarks on that part of the &s;ubject of educa|tion, which I would call the <HI>education of the heart.</HI> I am well aware, that this part al&s;o has not been le&s;s &s;kil|fully and forcibly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed than the re&s;t, though I cannot, at the &s;ame time, help remarking, that it does not appear to have been &s;o much adopted into common practice.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that notwith&s;tand|ing the great and real improvements, which have been made in the affair of female education, and notwith&s;tand|ing the more enlarged and generous views of it, which prevail in the pre|&s;ent day, that there is &s;till a very ma|terial defect, which it is not, in general, enough the object of attention to re|move. This defect &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in this, that too little regard is paid
<PB N="125" REF="130">to the di&s;po&s;itions of the <HI>mind,</HI> that the indications of the <HI>temper</HI> are not properly cheri&s;hed, nor the affections of the <HI>heart</HI> &s;ufficiently regulated.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t education of girls, as far as the cu&s;toms which fa&s;hion e&s;ta|bli&s;hes are right, they &s;hould undoubr|edly be followed. Let the exterior be made a con&s;iderable object of attention, but let it not be the principal, let it not be the only one.&mdash;Let the graces be indu&s;triou&s;ly cultivated, but let them not be cultivated at the expence of the virtues.&mdash;Let the arms, the head, the whole per&s;on be carefully poli&s;hed, but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy, which &s;hall be totally overlooked.</P>
<P>THE neglect of this cultivation &s;eems to proceed as much from a bad ta&s;te,
<PB N="126" REF="131">as from a fal&s;e principle. The gene|rality of people form their judgment of education by &s;light and &s;udden ap|pearances, which is certainly a wrong way of determining. Mu&s;ic, dancing, and languages, gratify tho&s;e who teach them, by perceptible and almo&s;t imme|diate effects; and when there happens to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor deficiency in the ma&s;ter, every &s;uper|ficial ob&s;erver can, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, judge of the progre&s;s.&mdash;The effects of mo&s;t of the&s;e accompli&s;hments addre&s;s them&s;elves to the &s;en&s;es; and there are more who can &s;ee and hear, than there are who can judge and reflect.</P>
<P>PERSONAL perfection is not only more obvious, it is al&s;o more rapid; and even in very accompli&s;hed charac|ters, elegance u&s;ually precedes prin|ciple.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="132">BUT the heart, that natural &s;eat of evil propen&s;ities, that little trouble|&s;ome empire of the pa&s;&s;ions, is led to what is right by &s;low motions and im|perceptible degrees. It mu&s;t be ad|moni&s;hed by reproof, and allured by kindne&s;s. Its livelie&s;t advances are frequently impeded by the ob&s;tinacy of prejudice, and its brighte&s;t pro|mi&s;es often ob&s;cured by the tempe&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion. It is &s;low in its acqui&s;ition of virtue, and reluctant in its ap|proaches to piety.</P>
<P>THERE is another rea&s;on, which proves this mental cultivation to be more important, as well as more diffi|cult, than any other part of education. In the u&s;ual fa&s;hionable accompli&s;h|ments, the bu&s;ine&s;s of acquiring them is almo&s;t always getting forwards, and one difficulty is conquered before an|other
<PB N="128" REF="133">other is &s;uffered to &s;hew it&s;elf; for a prudent teacher will level the road his pupil is to pa&s;s, and &s;mooth the in|equalities which might retard her pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT in morals, (which &s;hould be the great object con&s;tantly kept in view) the ta&s;k is far more difficult. The unruly and turbulent de&s;ires of the heart are not &s;o obedient; one pa&s;|&s;ion will &s;tart up before another is &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ubduing Hercules can|not cut off the heads &s;o often as the prolific Hydra can produce them, nor fell the &s;tubborn Antaeus &s;o fa&s;t as he can recruit his &s;trength, and ri&s;e in vigorous and repeated oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IF all the accompli&s;hments could be bought at the price of a &s;ingle virtue, the purcha&s;e would be infinitely dear!
<PB N="129" REF="134">And, however &s;tartling it may &s;ound, I think it is, notwith&s;tanding, true, that the labours of a good and wi&s;e mother, who is anxious for her daugh|ter's mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, will <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be at variance with tho&s;e of her in|&s;tructors. She will doubtle&s;s rejoice at her progre&s;s in any polite art, but &s;he will rejoice with trembling:&mdash;hu|mility and piety form the &s;olid and durable ba&s;is, on which &s;he wi&s;hes to rai&s;e the &s;uper&s;tructure of the accom|pli&s;hments, while the accompli&s;hments them&s;elves are frequently of that un|&s;teady nature, that if the foundation is not &s;ecured, in proportion as the building is enlarged, it will be over|loaded and de&s;troyed by tho&s;e very ornaments, which were intended to embelli&s;h, what they have contributed to ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">THE more o&s;ten&s;ible qualifications &s;hould be carefully regulated, or they will be in danger of putting to flight the mode&s;t train of retreating virtues, which cannot &s;afely &s;ub&s;i&s;t before the bold eye of public ob&s;ervation, or bear the bolder tongue of impudent and audacious flattery. A tender mo|ther cannot but feel an hone&s;t triumph, in contemplating tho&s;e excellencies in her daughter which de&s;erve applau&s;e, but &s;he will al&s;o &s;hudder at the vanity which that applau&s;e may excite, and at tho&s;e hitherto unknown ideas which it may awaken.</P>
<P>THE ma&s;ter, it is his intere&s;t, and perhaps his duty, will naturally teach a girl to &s;et her improvements in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous point of light. SE FAIRE VALOIR is the great principle indu&s;triou&s;ly inculcated into her young
<PB N="131" REF="136">heart, and &s;eems to be con&s;idered as a kind of fundamental maxim in edu|cation. It is however the certain and effectual &s;eed, from which a thou&s;and yet unborn vanities will &s;pring. This dangerous doctrine (which yet is not without its u&s;es) will be counteracted by the prudent mother, not in &s;o many words, but by a watchful and &s;carcely perceptible dexterity. Such an one will be more careful to have the talents of her daughter <HI>cultivated</HI> than <HI>exhibited.</HI></P>
<P>ONE would be led to imagine, by the common mode of female edu|cation, that life con&s;i&s;ted of one uni|ver&s;al holiday, and that the only con|te&s;t was, who &s;hould be be&s;t enabled to excel in the &s;ports and games that were to be celebrated on it. Merely ornamental accompli&s;hments will but
<PB N="132" REF="137">indifferently qualify a woman to per|form the <HI>duties</HI> of life, though it is highly proper &s;he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them, in order to furni&s;h the <HI>amu&s;ements</HI> of it. But is it right to &s;pend &s;o large a portion of life without &s;ome prepa|ration for the bu&s;ine&s;s of living? A lady may &s;peak a little French and Italian, repeat a few pa&s;&s;ages in a the|atrical tone, play and &s;ing, have her dre&s;&s;ing-room hung with her own draw|ings, and her per&s;on covered with her own tambour work, and may, not|with&s;tanding, have been very <HI>badly educated.</HI> Yet I am far from attempt|ing to depreciate the value of the&s;e qualifications: they are mo&s;t of them not only highly becoming, but often indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and a polite education cannot be perfected with|out them. But as the world &s;eems to be very well appri&s;ed of their import|ance,
<PB N="133" REF="138">there is the le&s;s occa&s;ion to in|&s;i&s;t on their utility. Yet, though well|bred young women &s;hould learn to dance, &s;ing, recite and draw, the end of a good education is not that they may become dancers, &s;ingers, players or painters: its real object is to make them good daughters, good wives, good mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, good members of &s;o|ciety, and good chri&s;tians. The above qualifications therefore are intended to <HI>adorn</HI> their <HI>lei&s;ure,</HI> not to <HI>employ</HI> their <HI>lives;</HI> for an amiable and wi&s;e woman will always have &s;omething better to value her&s;elf on, than the&s;e advan|tages, which, however captivating, are &s;till but &s;ubordinate parts of a truly excellent character.</P>
<P>BUT I am afraid parents them&s;elves &s;ometimes contribute to the error of which I am complaining. Do they
<PB N="134" REF="139">not often &s;et a higher value on tho&s;e acqui&s;itions which are calculated to attract ob&s;ervation, and catch the eye of the multitude, than on tho&s;e which are valuable, permanent, and internal? Are they not &s;ometimes more &s;olici|tous about the opinion of others, re|&s;pecting their children, than about the real advantage and happine&s;s of the children them&s;elves? To an inju|dicious and &s;uperficial eye, the be&s;t educated girl may make the lea&s;t bril|liant figure, as &s;he will probably have le&s;s flippancy in her manner, and le&s;s repartee in her expre&s;&s;ion; and her ac|quirements, to borrow bi&s;hop Sprat's idea, will be rather <HI>enamelled than em|bo&s;&s;ed.</HI> But her merit will be known, and acknowledged by all who come near enough to di&s;cern, and have ta&s;te enough to di&s;tingui&s;h. It will be un|der&s;tood and admired by the man,
<PB N="135" REF="140">who&s;e happine&s;s &s;he is one day to make, who&s;e family &s;he is to govern, and who&s;e children &s;he is to educate. He will not &s;eek for her in the haunts of di&s;&s;ipation, for he knows he &s;hall not find her there; but he will &s;eek for her in the bo&s;om of retirement, in the practice of every dome&s;tic virtue, in the exertion of every amiable ac|compli&s;hment, exerted in the &s;hade, to enliven retirement, to heighten the endearing plea&s;ures of &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e, and to embelli&s;h the narrow but charming circle of family delights. To this amiable purpo&s;e, a truly good and well educated young lady will de|dicate her more elegant accompli&s;h|ments, in&s;tead of exhibiting them to at|tract admiration, or depre&s;s inferiority.</P>
<P>YOUNG girls, who have more viva|city than under&s;tanding, will often
<PB N="136" REF="141">make a &s;prightly figure in conver&s;ation. But this agreeable talent for entertain|ing others, is frequently dangerous to them&s;elves, nor is it by any means to be de&s;ired or encouraged very early in life. This immaturity of wit is helped on by frivolous reading, which will produce its effect in much le&s;s time than books of &s;olid in&s;truction; for the imagination is touched &s;ooner than the under&s;tanding; and effects are more rapid as they are more pernicious. Conver&s;ation &s;hould be the <HI>re&s;ult</HI> of education, not the <HI>precur&s;or</HI> of it. It is a golden fruit, when &s;uffered to grow gradually on the tree of know|ledge; but if precipitated by forced and unnatural means, it will in the end become vapid, in proportion as it is artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="142">THE be&s;t effects of a careful and religious education are often very re|mote: they are to be di&s;covered in future &s;cenes, and exhibited in untried connexions. Every event of life will be putting the heart into fre&s;h &s;itu|ations, and making demands on its prudence, its firmne&s;s, its integrity, or its piety. Tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to form it, can fore&s;ee none of the&s;e &s;ituations; yet, as far as human wi&s;|dom will allow, they mu&s;t enable it to provide for them all, with an hum|ble dependence on the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A well-di&s;ciplined &s;oldier mu&s;t learn and practi&s;e all his evolutions, though he does not know on what &s;ervice his leader may command him, by what foe he &s;hall be attacked, not what mode of combat the enemy may u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="143">ONE great art of education con&s;i&s;ts in not &s;uffering the feelings to become too acute by unnece&s;&s;ary awakening, nor too obtu&s;e by the want of exertion. The former renders them the &s;ource of calamity, and totally ruins the tem|per; while the latter blunts and de|ba&s;es them, and produces a dull, cold, and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit. For the mind is an in&s;trument, which, if wound too high, will lo&s;e its &s;weetne&s;s, and if not enough &s;trained, will abate of its vi|gour.</P>
<P>How cruel is it to extingui&s;h by neglect or unkindne&s;s, the precious &s;en&s;ibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenous &s;oul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous &s;pirit! The&s;e are of higher worth than all the documents of learning, of dearer price than all
<PB N="139" REF="144">the advantages, which can be derived from the mo&s;t refined and artificial mode of education.</P>
<P>BUT &s;en&s;ibility and delicacy, and an ingenous temper, make no part of education, exclaims the pedagogue&mdash; they are reducible to no cla&s;s&mdash;they come under no article of in&s;truction&mdash; they belong neither to languages nor to mu&s;ic.&mdash;What an error! They <HI>are</HI> a part of education, and of infinitely more value,
<Q>Than all their pedant di&s;cipline e'er knew.</Q>
It is true, they are ranged under no cla&s;s, but they are &s;uperior to all; they are of more e&s;teem than languages or mu&s;ic, for they are the language of the heart, and the mu&s;ic of the accord|ing pa&s;&s;ions. Yet this &s;en&s;ibility is, in many in&s;tances, &s;o far from being
<PB N="140" REF="145">cultivated, that it is not uncommon to &s;ee tho&s;e who affect more than u&s;ual &s;agacity, ca&s;t a &s;mile of &s;upercilious pity, at any indication of a warm, generous, or enthu&s;ia&s;tic temper in the lively and the young; as much as to &s;ay, <Q>they will know better, and will have more di&s;cretion when they are older.</Q> But every appearance of amiable &s;implicity, or of hone&s;t &s;hame, <HI>Nature's ha&s;ty con&s;cience,</HI> will be dear to &s;en&s;ible hearts; they will carefully cheri&s;h every &s;uch indication in a young female; for they will perceive that it is this temper, wi&s;ely culti|vated, which will one day make her enamoured of the loveline&s;s of virtue, and the beauty of holine&s;s: from which &s;he will acquire a ta&s;te for the doctrines of religion, and a &s;pirit to perform the duties of it. And tho&s;e who wi&s;h to make her a&s;hamed of
<PB N="141" REF="146">this charming temper, and &s;eek to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s her of it, will, it is to be feared, give her nothing better in exchange.

<P>PRUDENCE is not natural to chil|dren; they can, however, &s;ub&s;titute art in its &s;tead. But is it not much better that a girl &s;hould di&s;cover the faults incident to her age, than con|ceal them under this dark and impe|netrable veil? I could almo&s;t venture to a&s;&s;ert, that there is &s;omething more becoming in the very errors of nature, where they are undi&s;gui&s;ed, than in the affectation of virtue it&s;elf, where the reality is wanting. And I am &s;o far from being an admirer of prodigies,
<PB N="142" REF="147">that I am extremely apt to &s;u&s;pect them; and am always infinitely better plea&s;ed with Nature in her more com|mon modes of operation. The preci&s;e and premature wi&s;dom, which &s;ome girls have cunning enough to a&s;&s;ume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their natural failings can be, as it effectually covers tho&s;e &s;ecret bad di&s;po&s;itions, which, if they di&s;played them&s;elves, might be rectified. The hypocri&s;y of a&s;&s;uming virtues which are not inherent in the heart, prevents the growth and di&s;clo&s;ure of tho&s;e real ones, which it is the great end of edu|cation to cultivate.</P>
<P>BUT if the natural indications of the temper are to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and &s;tifled, where are the diagno&s;tics, by which the &s;tate of the mind is to be known? The wi&s;e Author of all things, who
<PB N="143" REF="148">did nothing in vain, doubtle&s;s intend|ed them as &s;ymptoms, by which to judge of the di&s;ea&s;es of the heart; and it is impo&s;&s;ible di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould be cured before they are known. If the &s;tream be &s;o cut off as to prevent com|munication, or &s;o choked up as to defeat di&s;covery, how &s;hall we ever reach the &s;ource, out of which are the i&s;&s;ues of life?</P>
<P>THIS cunning, which, of all the different di&s;po&s;itions girls di&s;cover, is mo&s;t to be dreaded, is increa&s;ed by nothing &s;o much as by fear. If tho&s;e about them expre&s;s violent and unrea|&s;onable anger at every trivial offence, it will always promote this temper, and will very frequently create it, where there was a natural tendency to frankne&s;s. The indi&s;creet tran&s;ports of rage, which many betray on every
<PB N="144" REF="149">&s;light occa&s;ion, and the little di&s;tinc|tion they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes, naturally di&s;po&s;e a child to conceal, what &s;he does not however care to &s;uppre&s;s. Anger in one will not remedy the faults of another; for how can an in&s;trument of &s;in cure &s;in? If a girl is kept in a &s;tate of perpetual and &s;lavi&s;h terror, &s;he will perhaps have artifice enough to conceal tho&s;e propen&s;ities which &s;he knows are wrong, or tho&s;e actions which &s;he thinks are mo&s;t abnoxious to puni&s;hment. But, neverthele&s;s, &s;he will not cea&s;e to indulge tho&s;e propen|&s;ities, and to commit tho&s;e actions, when &s;he can do it with impunity.</P>
<P>GOOD <HI>di&s;po&s;itions,</HI> of them&s;elves, will go but a very little way, unle&s;s they are confirmed into good <HI>principles.</HI> And this cannot be effected but by a
<PB N="145" REF="150">careful cour&s;e of religious in&s;truction, and a patient and laborious cultivation of the moral temper.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding girls &s;hould not be treated with unkindne&s;s, nor the fir&s;t openings of the pa&s;&s;ions blight|ed by cold &s;everity; yet I am of opi|nion, that young females &s;hould be accu&s;tomed very early in life to a cer|tain degree of re&s;traint. The natural ca&s;t of character, and the moral di&s;|tinctions between the &s;exes, &s;hould not be di&s;regarded, even in childhood. That bold, independent, enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, which is &s;o much admired in boys, &s;hould not, when it happens to di&s;cover it&s;elf in the other &s;ex, be en|couraged, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Girls &s;hould be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciou&s;ly to car|ry on a di&s;pute, even if they &s;hould
<PB N="146" REF="151">know them&s;elves to be in the right. I do not mean, that they &s;hould be robbed of the liberty of private judg|ment, but that they &s;hould by no means be encouraged to contract a contentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greate&s;t importance to their future happine&s;s, that they &s;hould ac|quire a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper, and a for|bearing &s;pirit: for it is a le&s;&s;on which the world will not fail to make them frequently practi&s;e, when they come abroad into it, and they will not prac|ti&s;e it the wor&s;e for having learnt it the &s;ooner. The&s;e early re&s;traints, in the limitation here meant, are &s;o far from being an effect of cruelty, that they are the mo&s;t indubitable marks of affection, and are the more meritorious, as they are &s;evere trials of tenderne&s;s. But all the beneficial effects, which a mother can expect from this watch|fulne&s;s,
<PB N="147" REF="152">will be entirely defeated, if it is practi&s;ed occa&s;ionally, and not habitually, and if it ever appears to be u&s;ed to gratify caprice, ill-humour, or re&s;entment.</P>
<P>THOSE who have children to edu|cate ought to be extremely patient: it is indeed a labour of love. They &s;hould reflect, that extraordinary ta|lents are neither e&s;&s;ential to the well|being of &s;ociety, nor to the happine&s;s of individuals. If that had been the ca&s;e, the beneficent Father of the uni|ver&s;e would not have made them &s;o rare. For it is as ea&s;y for an Almighty Creator to produce a Newton, as an ordinary man; and he could have made tho&s;e powers common which we now con&s;ider as wonderful, without any miraculous exertion of his omnipo|tence, if the exi&s;tence of many New|tons
<PB N="148" REF="153">had been nece&s;&s;ary to the perfec|tion of his wi&s;e and gracious plan.</P>
<P>SURELY, therefore, there is more piety, as well as more &s;en&s;e, in labour|ing to improve the talents which chil|dren actually have, than in lamenting that they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;upernatural endowments or angelic perfections. A pa&s;&s;age of Lord Bacon's furni&s;hes an admirable incitement for endeavouring to carry the amiable and chri&s;tian grace of charity to its farthe&s;t extent, in&s;tead of indulging an over-anxious care for more brilliant but le&s;s impor|tant acqui&s;itions. <Q>The de&s;ire of power in exce&s;s (&s;ays he) cau&s;ed the angels to fall; the de&s;ire of know|ledge in exce&s;s cau&s;ed man to fall; but in charity is no exce&s;s, neither can men nor angels come into dan|ger by it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="154">A GIRL who has docility will &s;eldom be found to want under&s;tanding enough for all the purpo&s;es of a &s;ocial, a hap|py, and an u&s;eful life. And when we behold the tender hope of fond and anxious love, bla&s;ted by di&s;ap|pointment, the defect will as often be di&s;covered to proceed from the neglect or the error of cultivation, as from the natural temper; and tho&s;e who lament the evil, will &s;ometimes be found to have occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>IT is as injudicious for parents to &s;et out with too &s;anguine a dependence on the merit of their children, as it is for them to be di&s;couraged at every repul&s;e. When their wi&s;hes are de|feated in this or that particular in|&s;tance, where they had trea&s;ured up &s;ome darling expectation, this is &s;o far from being a rea&s;on for relaxing their
<PB N="150" REF="155">attention, that it ought to be an ad|ditional motive for redoubling it. Tho&s;e who hope to do a great deal, mu&s;t not expect to do every thing. If they know any thing of the malignity of &s;in, the blindne&s;s of prejudice, or the corruption of the human heart, they will al&s;o know, that that heart will al|ways remain, after the very be&s;t po&s;&s;ible education, full of infirmity and imperfec|tion. Extraordinary allowances, there|fore, mu&s;t be made for the weakne&s;s of nature in this its weake&s;t &s;tate. After much is done, much will remain to do, and much, very much, will &s;till be left undone. For this regulation of the pa&s;&s;ions and affections cannot be the work of education alone, with|out the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart. Why then &s;hould parents repine, if their efforts are not always crowned with imme|diate
<PB N="151" REF="156">&s;ucce&s;s? They &s;hould con&s;ider, that they are not educating cherubims and &s;eraphims, but men and women; creatures, who at their be&s;t e&s;tate are al|together vanity: how little then can be expected from them in the weakne&s;s and imbecillity of infancy! I have dwelt on this part of the &s;ubject the longer, becau&s;e I am certain that many, who have &s;et out with a warm and active zeal, have cooled on the very fir&s;t di&s;couragement, and have afterwards almo&s;t totally remitted their vigilance, through a criminal kind of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>GREAT allowances mu&s;t be made for a profu&s;ion of gaiety, loquacity, and even indi&s;cretion in children, that there may be animation enough left to &s;upply an active and u&s;eful character, when the fir&s;t fermentation of the youthful pa&s;&s;ions is over, and the re|dundant
<PB N="152" REF="157">&s;pirits &s;hall come to &s;ub|&s;ide.</P>
<P>IF it be true, as a con&s;ummate judge of human nature has ob&s;erved,
<Q>That not a vanity is given in vain,</Q>
it is al&s;o true, that there is &s;carcely a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion, which may not be turned to &s;ome good account, if prudently rectified, and &s;kilfully turned into the road of &s;ome neighbouring virtue. It cannot be violently bent, or unnatu|rally forced towards an object of a totally oppo&s;ite nature, but may be gradually inclined towards a corre&s;pon|dent but &s;uperior affection. Anger, hatred, re&s;entment, and ambition, the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions which &s;hake and di&s;tract the human &s;oul, may be led to become the mo&s;t active oppo&s;ers of &s;in, after having
<PB N="153" REF="158">been its mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;truments. Our anger, for in&s;tance, which can never be totally &s;ubdued, may be made to turn again&s;t our&s;elves, for our weak and imperfect obedience&mdash;our hatred, again&s;t every &s;pecies of vice&mdash;our am|bition, which will not be di&s;carded, may be ennobled: it will not change its name, but its object: it will de|&s;pi&s;e what it lately valued, nor be contented to gra&s;p at le&s;s than immor|tality.</P>
<P>THUS the joys, fears, hopes, de&s;ires, all the pa&s;&s;ions and affections, which &s;eparate in various currents from the &s;oul, will, if directed into their pro|per channels, after having fertili&s;ed wherever they have flowed, return again to &s;well and enrich the parent &s;ource.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="159">THAT the very pa&s;&s;ions which appear the mo&s;t uncontroulable and unpro|mi&s;ing, may be intended, in the great &s;cheme of Providence, to an&s;wer &s;ome important purpo&s;e, is remarkably evi|denced in the character and hi&s;tory of Saint Paul. A remark on this &s;ub|ject by an ingenious old Spani&s;h wri|ter, which I will here take the liberty to tran&s;late, will better illu&s;trate my meaning.</P>
<P><Q>To convert the bittere&s;t enemy into the mo&s;t zealous advocate, is the work of God for the in&s;truction of man. Plutarch has ob&s;erved, that the medical &s;cience would be brought to the utmo&s;t perfection, when poi&s;on &s;hould be converted into phy&s;ic. Thus, in the mortal di&s;ea&s;e of Judai&s;m and idolatry,
<PB N="155" REF="160">our ble&s;&s;ed Lord converted the ad|der's venom of Saul the per&s;ecutor, into that cement which made Paul the cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el. That manly ac|tivity, that re&s;tle&s;s ardor, that burning zeal for the law of his fathers, that ardent thir&s;t for the blood of Chri&s;tians, did the Son of God find nece&s;&s;ary in the man who was one day to become the defender of his &s;uffering people.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obras de Quevedo, vida de San Pablo Apo&s;tol.</NOTE></P>
<P>To win the pa&s;&s;ions, therefore, over to the cau&s;e of virtue, an&s;wers a much nobler end than their extinction would po&s;&s;ibly do, even if that could be ef|fected. But it is their nature never to ob&s;erve a neutrality; they are ei|ther rebels or auxiliaries, and an enemy &s;ubdued is an ally obtained.
<PB N="156" REF="161">If I may be allowed to change the al|lu&s;ion &s;o &s;oon, I would &s;ay, that the pa&s;&s;ions al&s;o re&s;emble fires, which are friendly and beneficial when under pro|per direction, but if &s;uffered to blaze without re&s;traint, they carry deva&s;tation along with them, and, if totally ex|tingui&s;hed, leave the benighted mind in a &s;tate of cold and comfortle&s;s in|anity.</P>
<P>BUT in &s;peaking of the u&s;efulne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions, as in&s;truments of vir|tue, <HI>envy</HI> and <HI>lying</HI> mu&s;t always be excepted: the&s;e, I am per&s;uaded, mu&s;t either go on in &s;till progre&s;&s;ive mi&s;|chief, or el&s;e be radically cured, be|fore any good can be expected from the heart which has been infected with them. For I never will believe that envy, though pa&s;&s;ed through all the moral &s;trainers, can be refined into a
<PB N="157" REF="162">virtuous emulation, or lying improved into an agreeable turn for innocent in|vention. Almo&s;t all the other pa&s;|&s;ions may be made to take an amiable hue; but the&s;e two mu&s;t either be to|tally extirpated, or be always content|ed to pre&s;erve their original deformity, and to wear their native black.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION TO THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS are the rea&s;ons why the greater part of mankind can|not apply them&s;elves to arts or letters. Particular &s;tudies are only &s;uited to the capacities of particular per&s;ons. Some are incapable of applying to
<PB N="159" REF="164">them from the delicacy of their &s;ex, &s;ome from the un&s;teadine&s;s of youth, and others from the imbecillity of age. Many are precluded by the narrow|ne&s;s of their education, and many by the &s;traitne&s;s of their fortune. The wi&s;dom of God is wonderfully mani|fe&s;ted in this happy and well-ordered diver&s;ity, in the powers and proper|ties of his creatures; &s;ince by thus ad|mirably &s;uiting the agent to the action, the whole &s;cheme of human affairs is carried on with the mo&s;t agreeing and con&s;i&s;tent oeconomy, and no cha&s;m is left for want of an object to fill it, ex|actly &s;uited to its nature.</P>
<P>BUT in the great and univer&s;al con|cern of religion, both &s;exes, and all ranks, are equally intere&s;ted. The truly catholic &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity ac|commodates it&s;elf, with an a&s;toni&s;h|ing
<PB N="160" REF="165">conde&s;cen&s;ion, to the circum&s;tances of the whole human race. It rejects none on account of their pecuniary wants, their per&s;onal infirmities, or their intellectual deficiencies. No &s;u|periority of parts is the lea&s;t recom|mendation, nor is any depre&s;&s;ion of fortune the &s;malle&s;t objection. None are too wi&s;e to be excu&s;ed from per|forming the duties of religion, nor are any too poor to be excluded from the con&s;olations of its promi&s;es.</P>
<P>IF we admire the wi&s;dom of God, in having furni&s;hed different degrees of intelligence, &s;o exactly adapted to their different de&s;tinations, and in having fitted every part of his &s;tupendous work, not only to &s;erve its own immediate purpo&s;e, but al&s;o to contribute to the beauty and perfection of the whole: how much more ought we to adore
<PB N="161" REF="166">that goodne&s;s, which has perfected the divine plan, by appointing one wide, comprehen&s;ive, and univer&s;al means of &s;alvation: a &s;alvation, which all are invited to partake; by a means which all are capable of u&s;ing; which nothing but voluntary blindne&s;s can prevent our comprehending, and no|thing but wilful error can hinder us from embracing.</P>
<P>THE Mu&s;es are coy, and will only be wooed and won by &s;ome highly-favoured &s;uitors. The Sciences are lofty, and will not &s;toop to the reach of ordinary capacities. But <Q>Wi&s;|dom (by which the royal preacher means piety) is a loving &s;pirit: &s;he is ea&s;ily &s;een of them that love her, and found of all &s;uch as &s;eek her.</Q> Nay, &s;he is &s;o acce&s;&s;ible and conde|&s;cending, <Q>that &s;he preventeth them
<PB N="162" REF="167">that de&s;ire her, making her&s;elf fir&s;t known unto them.</Q></P>
<P>WE are told by the &s;ame animated writer, <Q>that Wi&s;dom is the breath of the power of God.</Q> How infi|nitely &s;uperior, in grandeur and &s;ubli|mity, is this de&s;cription to the origin of the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of the heathens, as de|&s;cribed by their poets and mythologi&s;ts! In the exalted &s;trains of the Hebrew poetry we read, that <Q>Wi&s;dom is the brightne&s;s of the everla&s;ting light, the un&s;potted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his good|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>THE philo&s;ophical author of <HI>The Defence of Learning</HI> ob&s;erves, that knowledge has &s;omething of venom and malignity in it, when taken with|out its proper corrective, and what
<PB N="163" REF="168">that is, the in&s;pired Saint Paul teaches us, by placing it as the immediate an|tidote: <HI>Knowledge puffeth up, but cha|rity edifieth.</HI> Perhaps, it is the vanity of human wi&s;dom, uncha&s;ti&s;ed by this correcting principle, which has made &s;o many infidels. It may proceed from the arrogance of a &s;elf-&s;ufficient pride, that &s;ome philo&s;ophers di&s;dain to ac|knowledge their belief in a being, who has judged proper to conceal from them the infinite wi&s;dom of his coun|&s;els; who, (to borrow the lofty lan|guage of the man of Uz) refu&s;ed to con&s;ult them when he laid the foun|dations of the earth, when he &s;hut up the &s;ea with doors, and made the clouds the garment thereof.</P>
<P>A MAN mu&s;t be an infidel either from pride, prejudice, or bad educa|tion: he cannot be one unawares or
<PB N="164" REF="169">by &s;urpri&s;e; for infidelity is not occa|&s;ioned by &s;udden impul&s;e or violent temptation. He may be hurried by &s;ome vehement de&s;ire into an immoral action, at which he will blu&s;h in his cooler moments, and which he will lament as the &s;ad effect of a &s;pirit un|&s;ubdued by religion; but infidelity is a calm, con&s;iderate act, which cannot plead the weakne&s;s of the heart, or the &s;eduction of the &s;en&s;es. Even good men frequently fail in their duty through the infirmities of nature, and the allurements of the world; but the infidel errs on a plan, on a &s;ettled and deliberate principle.</P>
<P>But though the minds of men are &s;ometimes fatally infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, either through unhappy pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome of the other cau&s;es above mentioned; yet I am unwilling
<PB N="165" REF="170">to believe, that there is in nature &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly incongruous a being, as a <HI>female infidel.</HI> The lea&s;t reflexion on the temper, the character, and the education of women, makes the mind revolt with horror from an idea &s;o im|probable, and &s;o unnatural.</P>
<P>MAY I be allowed to ob&s;erve, that, in general, the minds of girls &s;eem more aptly prepared in their early youth for the reception of &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, and that their le&s;s expo&s;ed &s;ituations in more advanced life qualify them better for the pre&s;ervation of them? The daughters (of good parents I mean) are often more carefully in|&s;tructed in their religious duties, than the &s;ons, and this from a variety of cau&s;es. They are not &s;o &s;oon &s;ent from under the paternal eye into the
<PB N="166" REF="171">bu&s;tle of the world, and &s;o early ex|po&s;ed to the contagion of bad exam|ple: their hearts are naturally more flexible, &s;oft, and liable to any kind of impre&s;&s;ion the forming hand may &s;tamp on them; and, la&s;tly, as they do not receive the &s;ame cla&s;&s;ical edu|cation with boys, their feeble minds are not obliged at once to receive and &s;eparate the precepts of chri&s;tianity, and the documents of pagan philo&s;o|phy. The nece&s;&s;ity of doing this per|haps &s;omewhat weakens the &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions of young men, at lea&s;t till the under&s;tanding is formed, and con|fu&s;es their ideas of piety, by mixing them with &s;o much heterogeneous matter. They only ca&s;ually read, or hear read, the &s;criptures of truth, while they are obliged to learn by heart, con&s;true and repeat the poeti|cal fables of the le&s;s than human gods
<PB N="167" REF="172">of the ancients. And as the excellent au|thor of <HI>The Internal Evidence of the Chri&s;|tian Religion</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>Nothing has &s;o much contributed to corrupt the true &s;pirit of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, as that partiality which we contract, in our earlie&s;t education, for the manners of pagan antiquity.</Q></P>
<P>GIRLS, therefore, who do <HI>not</HI> con|tract this early partiality, ought to have a clearer notion of their religious duties: they are not obliged, at an age when the judgment is &s;o weak, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the doctrines of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Chri&s;t; and to embarra&s;s their minds with the various morals which were taught in the <HI>Porch,</HI> in the <HI>Academy,</HI> and on the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="173">IT is pre&s;umed, that the&s;e remarks cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o mi&s;under&s;tood, as to be con&s;trued into the lea&s;t di&s;re|&s;pect to literature, or a want of the highe&s;t reverence for a learned educa|tion, the ba&s;is of all elegant know|ledge: they are only intended, with all proper deference, to point out to young women, that however inferior their advantages of acquiring a know|ledge of the belles-lettres are to tho&s;e of the other &s;ex; yet it depends on them&s;elves not to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in this mo&s;t important of all &s;tudies, for which their abilities are equal, and their opportunities, perhaps, greater.</P>

Every rational woman &s;hould, no doubt, be able to give a rea&s;on of the hope that is in her; but this know|ledge is be&s;t acquired, and the duties con&s;equent on it be&s;t performed, by reading books of plain piety and prac|tical devotion, and not by entering into the endle&s;s feuds, and engaging in the unprofitable contentions of par|tial controver&s;iali&s;ts. Nothing is more unamiable than the narrow &s;pirit of party zeal, nor more di&s;gu&s;ting than
<PB N="172" REF="177">to hear a woman deal out judgments, and denounce vengeance again&s;t any one, who happens to differ from her in &s;ome opinion, perhaps of no real importance, and which, it is proba|ble, &s;he may be ju&s;t as wrong in re|jecting, as the object of her cen&s;ure is in embracing. A furious and unmer|ciful female bigot wanders as far be|yond the limits pre&s;cribed to her &s;ex, as a Thale&s;tris or a Joan d'Arc. Vio|lent debate has made as few converts as the &s;word, and both the&s;e in&s;tru|ments are particularly unbecoming when wielded by a female hand.</P>
<P>BUT, though no one will be fright|ened, out of their opinions, yet they may be per&s;uaded out of them: they may be touched by the affecting ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of &s;erious conver&s;ation, and allured by the attractive beauty of a
<PB N="173" REF="178">con&s;i&s;tently &s;erious life. And while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrangling polemic, it is her duty to a&s;pire after the honourable character of a &s;incere Chri&s;tian. But this dignified character &s;he can by no means de&s;erve, if &s;he is ever afraid to avow her principles, or a&s;hamed to defend them. A profligate, who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal in&s;truction, will be di&s;concerted at the &s;pirited yet mode&s;t rebuke of a pious young woman. But there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving prophanene&s;s, as in the words. If &s;he corrects it with moro&s;ene&s;s, &s;he defeats the effect of her remedy, by her un|&s;kilful manner of admini&s;tring it. If, on the other hand, &s;he affects to de|fend the in&s;ulted cau&s;e of God, in a faint tone of voice, and &s;tudied ambi|guity
<PB N="174" REF="179">of phra&s;e, or with an air of le|vity, and a certain expre&s;&s;ion of plea|&s;ure in her eyes, which proves &s;he is &s;ecretly delighted with what &s;he pre|tends to cen&s;ure, &s;he injures religion much more than he did who publickly prophaned it; for &s;he plainly indicates, either that &s;he does not believe, or re&s;pect what &s;he profe&s;&s;es. The other attacked it as an open foe; &s;he betrays it as a fal&s;e friend. No one pays any regard to the opinion of an avowed enemy; but the de&s;ertion or treachery of a profe&s;&s;ed friend, is dangerous in|deed!</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange notion which prevails in the world, that religion only be|longs to the old and the melancholy, and that it is not worth while to pay the lea&s;t attention to it, while we are capable of attending to any thing el&s;e.
<PB N="175" REF="180">They allow it to be proper enough for the clergy, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, and for the aged, who have not &s;pirits for any bu&s;ine&s;s at all. But till they can prove, that none except the clergy and the aged <HI>die,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this is mo&s;t wretched rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>GREAT injury is done to the inte|re&s;ts of religion, by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light. It is &s;ometimes &s;poken of, as if it would actually make a hand&s;ome woman ugly, or a young one wrinkled. But can any thing be more ab&s;urd than to re|pre&s;ent the beauty of holine&s;s as the &s;ource of deformity?</P>
<P>THERE are few, perhaps, &s;o entirely plunged in bu&s;ine&s;s, or ab&s;orbed in
<PB N="176" REF="181">plea&s;ure, as not to intend, at &s;ome future time, to &s;et about a religious life in good earne&s;t. But then they con&s;ider it as a kind of <HI>dernier re&s;&s;ort,</HI> and think it prudent to defer flying to this di&s;agreeable refuge, till they have no reli&s;h left for any thing el&s;e. Do they forget, that to perform this great bu&s;ine&s;s well requires all the &s;trength of their youth, and all the vigour of their unimpaired capacities? To con|firm this a&s;&s;ertion, they may ob&s;erve how much the &s;lighte&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition, even in the mo&s;t active &s;ea&s;on of life, di&s;orders every faculty, and di&s;|qualifies them for attending to the mo&s;t ordinary affairs: and then let them reflect how little able they will be to tran&s;act the mo&s;t important of all bu&s;ine&s;s, in the moment of excru|ciating pain, or in the day of uni|ver&s;al debility.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="182">WHEN the &s;en&s;es are palled with exce&s;&s;ive gratification; when the eye is tired with &s;eeing, and the ear with hearing; when the &s;pirits are &s;o &s;unk, that the <HI>gra&s;shopper is become a burthen,</HI> how &s;hall the blunted apprehen&s;ion be capable of under&s;tanding a new &s;cience, or the worn-out heart be able to reli&s;h a new plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>To put off religion till we have lo&s;t all ta&s;te for amu&s;ement; to refu&s;e li&s;|tening to the "voice of the charmer," till our enfeebled organs can no longer li&s;ten to the voice of <Q>&s;inging men and &s;inging women,</Q> and not to devote our days to heaven till we have "no plea&s;ure in them" our&s;elves, is but an ungracious offering. And it is a wretched &s;acri&s;ice to the God of heaven, to pre&s;ent him with the rem|nants of decayed appetites, and the leavings of extingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON GENIUS, TASTE, GOOD SENSE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE Author begs leave to offer an apology for introducing this E&s;&s;ay, which, &s;he fears, may be thought foreign to her purpo&s;e, But &s;he hopes that her earne&s;t de&s;ire of exciting a ta&s;te for literature in young ladies, (which encouraged her to hazard the following remarks) will not OBSTRUCT her general de&s;ign, even if it does not actually PROMOTE it.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>GOOD <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> is as different from <HI>genius</HI> as perception is from in|vention; yet, though di&s;tinct qualities,
<PB N="179" REF="184">they frequently &s;ub&s;i&s;t together. It is altogether oppo&s;ite to <HI>wit,</HI> but by no means incon&s;i&s;tent with it. It is not &s;cience, for there is &s;uch a thing as unlettered good &s;en&s;e; yet, though it is neither wit, learning, nor genius, it is a &s;ub&s;titute for each, where they do not exi&s;t, and the perfection of all where they do.</P>
<P>GOOD &s;en&s;e is &s;o far from de&s;erving the appellation of <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> by which it is frequently called, that it is perhaps one of the rare&s;t qualities of the human mind. If, indeed, this name is given it in re&s;pect to its pecu|liar &s;uitablene&s;s to the purpo&s;es of common life, there is great propriety
<PB N="180" REF="185">in it. Good &s;en&s;e appears to differ from ta&s;te in this, that ta&s;te is an in|&s;tantaneous deci&s;ion of the mind, a &s;udden reli&s;h of what is beautiful, or di&s;gu&s;t at what is defective, in an ob|ject, without waiting for the &s;lower confirmation of the judgment. Good &s;en&s;e is perhaps that confirmation, which e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;uddenly conceived idea, or feeling, by the powers of comparing and reflecting. They differ al&s;o in this, that ta&s;te &s;eems to have a more immediate reference to arts, to literature, and to almo&s;t every ob|ject of the &s;en&s;es; while good &s;en&s;e ri&s;es to moral excellence, and exerts its influence on life and manners. Ta&s;te is fitted to the perception and enjoy|ment of whatever is beautiful in art or nature: Good &s;en&s;e, to the improve|ment of the conduct, and the regulation of the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="186">YET the term good &s;en&s;e, is u&s;ed in|di&s;criminately to expre&s;s either a fini&s;h|ed ta&s;te for letters, or an invariable prudence in the affairs of life. It is &s;ometimes applied to the mo&s;t mode|rate abilities, in which ca&s;e, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion is certainly too &s;trong; and at others to the mo&s;t &s;hining, when it is as much too weak and inadequate. A &s;en&s;ible man is the u&s;ual, but unappro|priated phra&s;e, for every degree in the &s;cale of under&s;tanding, from the &s;ober mortal, who obtains it by his decent demeanor and &s;olid dullne&s;s, to him who&s;e talents qualify him to rank with a Bacon, a Harris, or a John&s;on.</P>
<P>GENIUS is the power of invention and imitation. It is an incommuni|cable faculty: no art or &s;kill of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can be&s;tow the &s;malle&s;t por|tion of it on another: no pains or la|bour
<PB N="182" REF="187">can reach the &s;ummit of perfec|tion, where the &s;eeds of it are want|ing in the mind; yet it is capable of infinite improvement where it actually exi&s;ts, and is attended with the highe&s;t capacity of communicating in&s;truction, as well as delight to others.</P>
<P>It is the peculiar property of genius to'&s;trike out great or beautiful things: it is the felicity of good &s;en&s;e not to do ab&s;urd ones. Genius breaks out in &s;plendid &s;entiments and elevated ideas; good &s;en&s;e confines its more circum|&s;cribed, but perhaps more u&s;eful walk, within the limits of prudence and pro|priety.</P>
<Q><L>The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling,</L>
<L>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</L>
<L>And, as imagination bodies forth</L>
<L>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="188">
Turns them to &s;hape, and gives to airy nothing</L>
<L>A local habitation and a name.</L></Q>
<P>THIS is perhaps the fine&s;t picture of human genius that ever was drawn by a human pencil. It pre&s;ents a living image of a creative imagination, or a power of inventing things which have no actual exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uperficial judges, who, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, make up the greater part of the ma&s;s of mankind, talents are only liked or under&s;tood to a cer|tain degree. Lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary apprehen&s;ions: the vulgar allow tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them to be in a &s;omewhat higher &s;tate of mind than them&s;elves; but of the va&s;t gulf which &s;eparates them, they have not the lea&s;t conception. They ac|knowledge a &s;uperiority, but of its extent they neither know the value,
<PB N="184" REF="189">nor can conceive the reality. It is true, the mind, as well as the eye, can take in objects larger than it&s;elf; but this is only true of great minds: for a man of low capacity, who con|&s;iders a con&s;ummate genius, re&s;embles one, who &s;eeing a column for the fir&s;t time, and &s;tanding at too great a di&s;|tance to take in the whole of it, con|cludes it to be flat. Or, like one unacquainted with the fir&s;t principles of philo&s;ophy, who, finding the &s;en|&s;ible horizon appear a plain &s;urface, can form no idea of the &s;pherical form of the whole, which he does not &s;ee, and laughs at the account of antipodes, which he cannot comprehend.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is excellent is al&s;o rare; what is u&s;eful is more common. How many thou&s;ands are born qualified for the coar&s;e employments of life, for
<PB N="185" REF="190">one who is capable of excelling in the fine arts! yet &s;o it ought to be, be|cau&s;e our natural wants are more nu|merous, and more importunate, than the intellectual.</P>
<P>WHENEVER it happens that a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents has been drawn by mi&s;take, or precipitated by pa&s;&s;ion, into any dangerous indi&s;cretion; it is common for tho&s;e who&s;e coldne&s;s of temper has &s;upplied the place, and u&s;urped the name of prudence, to boa&s;t of their own &s;teadier virtue, and triumph in their own &s;uperior caution; only becau&s;e they have never been a&s;|&s;ailed by a temptation &s;trong enough to &s;urpri&s;e them into error. And with what a vi&s;ible appropriation of the cha|racter to them&s;elves, do they con&s;tantly conclude, with a cordial compliment to <HI>common &s;en&s;e!</HI> They point out the
<PB N="186" REF="191">beauty and u&s;efulne&s;s of this quality &s;o forcibly and explicitly, that you cannot po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;take who&s;e picture they are drawing with &s;o flattering a pencil. The unhappy man who&s;e con|duct has been &s;o feelingly arraigned, perhaps acted from good, though mi&s;|taken motives; at lea&s;t, from motives of which his cen&s;urer has not capacity to judge: but the event was unfavour|able, nay the action might be really wrong, and the vulgar maliciou&s;ly take the opportunity of this &s;ingle indi&s;cre|tion, to lift them&s;elves nearer on a level with a character, which, except in this in&s;tance, has always thrown them at the mo&s;t di&s;graceful and mor|tifying di&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE elegant Biographer of Collins, in his affecting apology for that unfor|tunate genius, remarks, <Q>That the
<PB N="187" REF="192">gifts of imagination bring the heavie&s;t ta&s;k on the vigilance of rea&s;on; and to bear tho&s;e faculties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a degree of firmne&s;s, and of cool attention, which does not al|ways attend the higher gifts of the mind; yet difficult as Nature her&s;elf &s;eems to have rendered the ta&s;k of regularity to genius, it is the &s;u|preme con&s;olation of dullne&s;s, and of folly to point with gothic triumph to tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which are the overflowing of faculties they never enjoyed.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT the greater part of the world mean by common &s;en&s;e, will be gene|rally found, on a clo&s;er enquiry, to be art, fraud, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s! That &s;ort of &s;aving prudence which makes men ex|tremely attentive to their own &s;afety,
<PB N="188" REF="193">or profit; diligent in the pur&s;uit of their own plea&s;ures or intere&s;ts; and perfectly at their ea&s;e as to what be|comes of the re&s;t of mankind. Furies, where their own property is concerned, philo&s;ophers when nothing but the good of others is at &s;take, and per|fectly re&s;igned under all calamities but their own.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;ee &s;o many accompli&s;hed wits of the pre&s;ent age, as remarkable for the decorum of their lives, as for the brilliancy of their writings, we may believe, that, next to principle, it is owing to their <HI>good &s;en&s;e,</HI> which re|gulates and cha&s;ti&s;es their imaginations. The va&s;t conceptions which enable a true genius to a&s;cend the &s;ublime&s;t heights, may be &s;o connected with the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, as to give it a na|tural tendency to fly off from the &s;trait
<PB N="189" REF="194">line of regularity; till good &s;en&s;e, act|ing on the fancy, makes it gravitate powerfully towards that virtue which is its proper centre.</P>
<P>ADD to this, when it is con&s;idered with what imperfection the Divine Wi&s;dom has thought &s;it to &s;tamp every thing human, it will be found, that excellence and infirmity are &s;o in&s;epa|rably wound up in each other, that a man derives the &s;orene&s;s of temper, and irritability of nerve, which make him unea&s;y to others, and unhappy in him&s;elf, from tho&s;e exqui&s;ite feelings, and that elevated pitch of thought, by which, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it on a more &s;erious ccca&s;ion, he is, as it were, out of the body.</P>
<P>IT is not a&s;toni&s;hing, therefore, when the &s;pirit is carried away by the mag|nificence of its own ideas,
<Q><PB N="190" REF="195">Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but in&s;pir'd,</Q>
that the frail body, which is the na|tural victim of pain, di&s;ea&s;e, and death, &s;hould not always be able to follow the mind in its a&s;piring flights, but &s;hould be as imperfect as if it belonged only to an ordinary &s;oul.</P>
<P>BESIDES, might not Providence intend to humble human pride, by pre&s;enting to our eyes &s;o mortifying a view of the weakne&s;s and infirmity of even his be&s;t work? Perhaps man, who is already but a little lower than the angels, might, like the revolted &s;pirits, totally have &s;haken off obedience and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his Creator, had not God wi&s;ely tempered human excellence with a certain con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own im|perfection. But though this inevitable alloy of weakne&s;s may frequently be
<PB N="191" REF="196">found in the be&s;t characters, yet how can that be the &s;ource of triumph and exaltation to any, which, if properly weighed, mu&s;t be the deepe&s;t motive of humiliation to all? A good-natured man will be &s;o far from rejoicing, that he will be &s;ecretly troubled, whenever he reads that the greate&s;t Roman morali&s;t was tainted with avarice, and the greate&s;t Briti&s;h philo&s;opher with ve|nality.</P>
<P>IT is remarked by Pope, in his E&s;|&s;ay on Critici&s;m, that,
<Q>Ten cen&s;ure wrong for one who writes ami&s;s.</Q>
But I apprehend it does not therefore follow that to judge, is more difficult than to write. If this were the ca&s;e, the critic would be &s;uperior to the poet, whereas it appears to be directly
<PB N="192" REF="197">the contrary. "The critic, (&s;ays the great champion of Shake&s;peare,) but fa&s;hions the body of a work, the poet mu&s;t add the &s;oul, which gives force and direction to its actions and ge&s;tures." It &s;hould &s;eem that the rea&s;on why &s;o many more judge wrong, than write ill, is becau&s;e the number of readers is beyond all proportion greater than the number of writers. Every man who reads, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure a critic, and, with very common abilities, may point out real faults and material er|rors in a very well written book; but it by no means follows that he is able to write any thing comparable to the work which he is capable of cen&s;uring. And unle&s;s the numbers of tho&s;e who write, and of tho&s;e who judge, were more equal, the calculation &s;eems not to be quite fair.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="198">A CAPACITY for reli&s;hing works of genius is the indubitable &s;ign of a good ta&s;te. But if a proper di&s;po&s;ition and ability to enjoy the compo&s;itions of others, entitle a man to the claim of reputation, it is &s;till a far inferior de|gree of merit to his who can invent and produce tho&s;e compo&s;itions, the bare di&s;qui&s;ition of which gives the critic no &s;mall &s;hare of fame.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ident of the royal academy in his admirable <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> on <HI>imitation,</HI> has &s;et the folly of depending on una&s;|&s;i&s;ted genius, in the cleare&s;t light; and has &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity of adding the knowledge of others, to our own native powers, in his u&s;ual &s;triking and ma&s;ter|ly manner. <Q>The mind, &s;ays he, is a barren &s;oil, is a &s;oil &s;oon exhau&s;ted, and will produce no crop, or only one, unle&s;s it be continually fertiliz|ed,
<PB N="194" REF="199">and enriched with foreign mat|ter.</Q></P>
<P>YET it has been objected that &s;tudy is a great enemy to originality; but even if this were true, it would per|haps be as well that an author &s;hould give us the ideas of &s;till better writers, mixed and a&s;&s;imilated with the matter in his own mind, as tho&s;e crude and undige&s;ted thoughts which he values under the notion that they are original. The &s;weete&s;t honey neither ta&s;tes of the ro&s;e, the honey&s;uckle, nor the carna|tion, yet it is compounded of the very e&s;&s;ence of them all.</P>
<P>IF in the other fine arts this accu|mulation of knowledge is nece&s;&s;ary, it is indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;o in poetry. It is a fatal ra&s;hne&s;s for any one to tru&s;t too much to their own &s;tock of ideas.
<PB N="195" REF="200">He mu&s;t invigorate them by exerci&s;e, poli&s;h them by conver&s;ation, and in|crea&s;e them by every &s;pecies of elegant and virtuous knowledge, and the mind will not fail to reproduce with intere&s;t tho&s;e &s;eeds, which are &s;own in it by &s;tudy and ob&s;ervation. Above all, let every one guard again&s;t the dan|gerous opinion that he knows enough: an opinion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind, which, though once perhaps vigorous and effectual, will be &s;unk to a &s;tate of literary imbecility, by cheri&s;hing vain and pre&s;umptuous ideas of its own independence.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance, it may not be nece&s;&s;ary that a poet &s;hould be deeply &s;killed in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem; but it mu&s;t be allowed that a general acquaintance with plants and flowers will furni&s;h
<PB N="196" REF="201">him with a delightful and profitable &s;pe|cies of in&s;truction. He is not obliged to trace Nature in all her nice and varied operations, with the minute accuracy of a Boyle, or the laborious inve&s;tiga|tion of a Newton; but his <HI>good &s;en&s;e</HI> will point out to him that no incon&s;ide|rable portion of philo&s;ophical know|ledge is requi&s;ite to the completion of his literart character. The &s;ciences are more independent, and require little or no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the graces of poetry; but poetry, if &s;he would charm and in&s;truct, mu&s;t not be &s;o haughty; &s;he mu&s;t be contented to borrow of the &s;ciences, many of her choice&s;t allu&s;ions, and many of her mo&s;t graceful embelli&s;hments; and does it not magnify the character of true poe&s;y, that &s;he includes within her&s;elf all the &s;cattered graces of every &s;eparate art?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="202">THE rules of the great ma&s;ters in critici&s;m may not be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the forming a good ta&s;te, as the ex|amination of tho&s;e original mines from whence they drew their trea&s;ures of knowledge.</P>
<P>THE three celebrated E&s;&s;ays on the Art of Poetry do not teach &s;o much by their laws as by their examples; the dead letter of their rules is le&s;s in|&s;tructive than the living &s;pirit of their ver&s;e. Yet the&s;e rules are to a young poet, what the &s;tudy of logarithms is to a young mathematician; they do not &s;o much contribute to form his judgment, as afford him the &s;atisfac|tion of convincing him that he is right. They do not preclude the difficulty of the operation; but at the conclu&s;ion of it, furni&s;h him with a fuller demon|&s;tration that he has proceeded on pro|per
<PB N="198" REF="203">principles. When he has well &s;tudied the ma&s;ters in who&s;e &s;chools the fir&s;t critics formed them&s;elves, and fancies he has caught a &s;park of their divine Flame, it may be a good me|thod to try his own compo&s;itions by the te&s;t of the critic rules, &s;o far in|deed as the mechani&s;m of poetry goes. If the examination be fair and candid, this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's &s;pear, will detect every latent error, and bring to light every favourite failing.</P>
<P>GOOD ta&s;te always &s;uits the mea&s;ure of its admiration to the merit of the compo&s;ition it examines. It accom|modates its prai&s;es, or its cen&s;ure, to the excellence of a work, and appro|priates it to the nature of it. General applau&s;e, or indi&s;criminate abu&s;e, is the &s;ign of a vulgar under&s;tanding. There are certain blemi&s;hes which the
<PB N="199" REF="204">judicious and good-natured reader will candidly overlook. But the fal&s;e &s;ub|lime, the tumour which is intended for greatne&s;s, the di&s;torted figure, the puerile conceit, and the incongruous metaphor, the&s;e are defects for which &s;carcely any other kind of merit can atone. And yet there may be more hope of a writer (e&s;pecially if he be a a young one), who is now and then guilty of &s;ome of the&s;e faults, than of one who avoids them all, not through judgment, but feeblene&s;s, and who, in&s;tead of deviating into error is con|tinually falling &s;hort of excellence. The meer ab&s;ence of error implies that moderate and inferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phleg|matic ta&s;te will be better &s;atisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted &s;pirits. It &s;tretches &s;ome minds to an unea&s;y exten&s;ion to be obliged
<PB N="200" REF="205">to attend to compo&s;itions &s;uperlatively excellent; and it contracts liberal &s;ouls to a painful narrowne&s;s to de&s;cend to books of inferior merit. A work of capital genius, to a man of an ordinary mind, is the bed of Procru&s;tes to one of a &s;hort &s;tature, the man is too little to fill up the &s;pace a&s;&s;igned him, and undergoes the torture in attempting it: and a moderate, or low production to a man of bright talents, is the pu|ni&s;hment inflicted by Mezentius; the living &s;pirit has too much animation to endure patiently to be in contact with a dead body.</P>
<P>TASTE &s;eems to be a &s;entiment of the &s;oul which gives the bias to opinion, for we feel before we reflect. Without this &s;entiment, all knowledge, learning and opinion, would be cold, inert materials, whereas they become active
<PB N="201" REF="206">principles when &s;tirred, kindled, and inflamed by this animating quality.</P>
<P>THERE is another feeling which is called Enthu&s;ia&s;m. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;en&s;ible hearts is &s;o &s;trong, that it not only yields to the impul&s;e with which &s;triking objects act on it, but &s;uch hearts help on the effect by their own &s;en&s;ibility. In a &s;cene where Shake&s;peare and Garrick give perfec|tion to each other, the feeling heart does not merely accede to the delirium they occa&s;ion: it does more, it is en|amoured of it, it &s;olicits the delu&s;ion, it &s;ues to be deceived, and grudgingly cheri&s;hes the &s;acred trea&s;ure of its feel|ings. The poet and performer concur in carrying us
<Q>Beyond this vi&s;ible diurnal &s;phere,</Q>
they bear us aloft in their airy cour&s;e with unre&s;i&s;ted rapidity, if they meet not with any ob&s;truction
<PB N="202" REF="207">from the coldne&s;s of our own feelings. Perhaps, only a few fine &s;pirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting; but the multitude do not enjoy le&s;s acutely, becau&s;e they are not able philo&s;ophically to analy&s;e the &s;ources of their joy or &s;orrow. If the others have the advantage of judging, the&s;e have at lea&s;t the privilege of feeling: and it is not from complai&s;ance to a few leading judges, that they bur&s;t into peals of laughter, or melt into delightful agony; their hearts de|cide, and that is a deci&s;ion from which there lies no appeal. It mu&s;t how|ever be confe&s;&s;ed, that the nicer &s;epa|rations of character, and the lighter and almo&s;t imperceptible &s;hades which &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h them, will not be intimately reli&s;hed, unle&s;s there be a con&s;onancy of ta&s;te as well as feel|ing in the &s;pectator; though where the
<PB N="203" REF="208">pa&s;&s;ions are principally concerned, the profane vulgar come in for a larger portion of the univer&s;al delight, than critics and connoi&s;&s;eurs are willing to allow them.</P>
<P>YET enthu&s;ia&s;m, though the natu|ral concomitant of genius, is no more genius it&s;elf, than drunkenne&s;s is cheer|fulne&s;s; and that enthu&s;ia&s;m which di&s;covers it&s;elf on occa&s;ions not worthy to excite it, is the mark of a wretched judgment and a fal&s;e ta&s;te.</P>
<P>NATURE produces innumerable ob|jects: to imitate them, is the province of Genius; to direct tho&s;e imitations, is the property of Judgment; to decide on their effects, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ta&s;te. For Ta&s;te, who &s;its as &s;upreme judge on the productions of Genius, is not &s;atisfied when &s;he merely imitates Na|ture:
<PB N="204" REF="209">&s;he mu&s;t al&s;o, &s;ays an ingeni|ous French writer, imitate <HI>beautiful</HI> Nature. It requires no le&s;s judgment to reject than to choo&s;e, and Genius might imitate what is vulgar, under pretence that it was natural, if Ta&s;te did not carefully point out tho&s;e ob|jects which are mo&s;t proper for imita|tion. It al&s;o requires a very nice di&s;|cernment to di&s;tingui&s;h veri&s;imilitude from truth; for there is a truth in Ta&s;te nearly as conclu&s;ive as demon|&s;tration in mathematics.</P>
<P>GENIUS, when in the full impetu|o&s;ity of its career, often touches on the very brink of error; and is, perhaps, never &s;o near the verge of the preci|pice, as when indulging its &s;ublime&s;t flights. It is in tho&s;e great, but dan|gerous moments, that the curb of vigilant judgment is mo&s;t wanting:
<PB N="205" REF="210">while &s;afe and &s;ober Dulne&s;s ob&s;erves one tedious and in&s;ipid round of tire|&s;ome uniformity, and &s;teers equally clear of eccentricity and of beauty. Dulne&s;s has few redundancies to re|trench, few luxuriancies to prune, and few irregularities to &s;mooth. The&s;e, though errors, are the errors of Ge|nius, for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude, or irregularity with|out greatne&s;s. The exce&s;&s;es of Genius may ea&s;ily be retrenched, but the de|ficiencies of Dulne&s;s can never be &s;up|plied.</P>
<P>THOSE who copy from others will doubtle&s;s be le&s;s excellent than tho&s;e who copy from Nature. To imitate imitators, is the way to depart too far from the great original her&s;elf. The latter copies of an engraving retain fainter and fainter traces of the &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="206" REF="211">to which the earlier impre&s;&s;ions bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems very extraordinary, that it &s;hould be the mo&s;t difficult thing in the world to be natural; and that it &s;hould be harder to hit off the manners of real life, and to delineate &s;uch cha|racters as we conver&s;e with every day, than to imagine &s;uch as do not exi&s;t. But caricature is much ea&s;ier than an exact outline, and the colouring of fancy le&s;s difficult than that of truth.</P>
<P>People do not always know what ta&s;te they have, till it is awakened by &s;ome corre&s;ponding object; nay, genius it|&s;elf is a fire, which in many minds would never blaze, if not kindled by &s;ome external cau&s;e.</P>
<P>NATURE, that munificent mother, when &s;he be&s;tows the power of judg|ing,
<PB N="207" REF="212">accompanies it with the capacity of enjoying. The judgment, which is clear &s;ighted, points out &s;uch objects as are calculated to in&s;pire love, and the heart in&s;tantaneou&s;ly attaches it&s;elf to whatever is lovely.</P>
<P>IN regard to literary reputation, a great deal depends on the &s;tate of learning in the particular age or na|tion, in which an author lives. In a dark and ignorant period, moderate knowledge will entitle its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to a con&s;iderable &s;hare of fame; whereas, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a polite and let|tered age, requires &s;triking parts and deep erudition.</P>
<P>WHEN a nation begins to emerge from a &s;tate of mental darkne&s;s, and to &s;trike out the fir&s;t rudiments of im|provement, it chalks out a few &s;trong
<PB N="208" REF="213">but incorrect &s;ketches, gives the rude out-lines of general art, and leaves the filling up to the lei&s;ure of happier days, and the refinement of more en|lightened times. Their drawing is a rude <HI>Sbozzo,</HI> and their poetry wild min&s;trel&s;y.</P>
<P>PERFECTION of ta&s;te is a point which a nation no &s;ooner reaches, than it over&s;hoots; and it is more difficult to return to it, after having pa&s;&s;ed it, than it was to attain when they fell &s;hort of it. Where the arts begin to langui&s;h after having flouri&s;hed, they feldom indeed fall back to their origi|nal barbari&s;m, but a certain feeblene&s;s of exertion takes place, and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying languor to their proper &s;trength, than it was to poli&s;h them from their former redene&s;s; for it is a le&s;s for|midable
<PB N="209" REF="214">undertaking to refine barba|rity, than to &s;top decay: the fir&s;t may be laboured into elegance, but the latter will rarely be &s;trengthened into vigour.</P>
<P>TASTE exerts it&s;elf at fir&s;t but feebly and imperfectly: it is repre&s;&s;ed and kept back by a crowd of the mo&s;t di&s;cou|raging prejudices: like an infant prince, who, though born to reign, yet holds an idle &s;ceptre, which he has not power to u&s;e, but is obliged to &s;ee with the eyes, and hear through the ears of other men.</P>
<P>A WRITER of correct ta&s;te will hard|ly ever go out of his way, even in &s;earch of embelli&s;hment: he will &s;tudy to attain the be&s;t end by the mo&s;t na|tural means; for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beautiful, and
<PB N="210" REF="215">that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place; for an improper &s;itu|ation will convert the mo&s;t &s;triking beauty into a glaring defect. When by a well-connected chain of ideas, or a judicious &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, the reader is &s;natched to <Q>Thebes or Athens,</Q> what can be more imper|tinent than for the poet to ob&s;truct the operation of the pa&s;&s;ion he has ju&s;t been kindling, by introducing a con|ceit which contradicts his purpo&s;e, and interrupts his bu&s;ine&s;s? Indeed, we cannot be tran&s;ported, even in idea, to tho&s;e places, if the poet does not manage &s;o adroitly as not to make us &s;en&s;ible of the journey: the in&s;tant we feel we are travelling, the writer's art fails, and the delirium is at an end.</P>
<P>PROSERPINE, &s;ays Ovid, would have been re&s;tored to her mother Ceres, had
<PB N="211" REF="216">not A&s;calaphus &s;een her &s;top to gather a golden apple, when the terms of her re&s;toration were, that &s;he &s;hould ta&s;te nothing. A &s;tory pregnant with in|&s;truction for lively writers, who by neglecting the main bu&s;ine&s;s, and go|ing out of the way for fal&s;e gratifica|tions, lo&s;e &s;ight of the end they &s;hould principally keep in view. It was this fal&s;e ta&s;te that introduced the number|le&s;s <HI>concetti,</HI> which di&s;grace the bright|e&s;t of the Italian poets; and this is the rea&s;on, why the reader only feels &s;hort and interrupted &s;natches of delight in peru&s;ing the brilliant but unequal compo&s;itions of Ario&s;to, in&s;tead of that unbroken and undimini&s;hed plea|&s;ure, which he con&s;tantly receives from Virgil, from Milton, and generally from Ta&s;&s;o. The fir&s;t-mentioned Ita|lian is the Atalanta, who will interrupt the mo&s;t eager career, to pick up the
<PB N="212" REF="217">glittering mi&s;chief, while the Man|tuan and the Briti&s;h bards, like Hip|pomenes, pre&s;s on warm in the pur|&s;uit, and un&s;educed by temptation.</P>
<P>A WRITER of real ta&s;te will take great pains in the perfection of his &s;tyle, to make the reader believe that he took none at all. The writing which ap|pears to be mo&s;t ea&s;y, will be gene|rally found to be lea&s;t imitable. The mo&s;t elegant ver&s;es are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily retained, they fa&s;ten them&s;elves on the memory, without its making any effort to pre&s;erve them, and we are apt to ima|gine, that what is remembered with ea&s;e, was written without difficulty.</P>
<P>To conclude; Genius is a rare and precious gem, of which few know the worth; it is &s;itter for the cabinet of the connoi&s;&s;eur, than for the com|merce
<PB N="213" REF="218">of mankind. Good &s;en&s;e is a bank-bill, convenient for change, ne|gotiable at all times, and current in all places. It knows the value of &s;mall things, and con&s;iders that an aggregate of them makes up the &s;um of human affairs. It elevates common concerns into matters of importance, by performing them in the be&s;t man|ner, and at the mo&s;t &s;uitable &s;ea&s;on. Good &s;en&s;e carries with it the idea of equality, while Genius is always &s;u&s;|pected of a de&s;ign to impo&s;e the burden of &s;uperiority; and re&s;pect is paid to it with that reluctance which always attends other impo&s;ts, the lower or|ders of mankind generally repining mo&s;t at demands, by which they are lea&s;t liable to be affected.</P>
<P>As it is the character of Genius to penetrate with a lynx's beam into
<PB N="214" REF="219">unfathomable aby&s;&s;es and uncreated worlds, and to &s;ee what is <HI>not,</HI> &s;o it is the property of good &s;en&s;e to di&s;tin|gui&s;h perfectly, and judge accurately what really <HI>is.</HI> Good &s;en&s;e has not &s;o piercing an eye, but it has as clear a &s;ight: it does not penetrate &s;o deeply, but as far as it <HI>does</HI> &s;ee, it di&s;cerns di&s;tinctly. Good &s;en&s;e is a judicious mechanic, who can produce beauty and convenience out of &s;uitable means; but Genius (I &s;peak with reverence of the immea&s;urable di&s;tance) bears &s;ome remote re&s;emblance to the divine ar|chitect, who produced perfection of beauty without any vi&s;ible materials, <HI>who &s;pake, and it was created;</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>Let it be, and it was.</HI></P>
