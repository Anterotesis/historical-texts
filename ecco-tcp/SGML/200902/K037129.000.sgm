<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD CAMDEN, LORD PRESIDENT OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONORABLE PRIVY-COUNCIL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the high rank you have long held as an enlightened State&s;man, an accom|pli&s;hed Orator, and a wi&s;e Legi&s;lator, I fear I &s;hall incur the cen&s;ure of pre&s;umption, for daring to tre&s;pa&s;s upon that attention, &s;o much more nobly employed in meditating your country's good. But great minds can de&s;cend with ea&s;e, from the dignity of their &s;pheres, to the contemplation of the mo&s;t minute objects; and what would confu&s;e, or impede, the operation of feebler faculties, acts only as a relief to &s;uperior &s;pirits, lend|ing them additional vigour in pur&s;uits, which call forth all their energies. Your Lord&s;hip's partiality to the Dramatic Mu&s;e is well known; and the ME|CAENAS of a GARRICK may naturally expect, that Writers for the Stage will lay their offerings at the feet of a Nobleman, univer&s;ally allowed the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite Judge in their own art.&mdash;Not content with the private &s;atisfaction I enjoy from my veneration for &s;plendid abilities, and di&s;tingui&s;hed virtue, I am am|bitious the world &s;hould know I am capable of ad|miring them.&mdash;There is a protecting influence in the name of CAMDEN, that recommends to the wife, and to the good; it is au&s;picious to every Mu&s;e, and every honorable undertaking&mdash;and as &s;uch, I have prefixed it to my work; in imitation of the fir&s;t CAESAR, who concealed his baldne&s;s under a laurel.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to remain, with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, MY LORD, Your mo&s;t devoted and obedient Servant, FREDERICK PILON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>Lord, Ma'am! one has &s;o much plea|&s;ure in London, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know the difference betwixt &s;ummer and winter.

Isn't he a gentleman of as good family, and as good fortune, as any in the country? &mdash;Od's my life, Ma'am! pluck up a &s;pirit; and, &s;ince he is determined to &s;hut us up, like two &s;tar|lings in a dark cage, I think it is fit he &s;hould know we have learned to talk in our confinement.</P>

<P>You &s;hall hear.&mdash;As my father lived in the interior part of the province of South-Carolina, he &s;ent my brother, attended by two &s;ervants, to e&s;cort me in &s;afety to Charles Town, where I was to embark
<PB N="14" REF="10">for England. Through the ignorance of guides we lo&s;t our way, and fell in with a party of the French; but were &s;carce made pri&s;oners, when an alarm was given of an enemy being in &s;ight. Oh, Heavens! how my heart beat!&mdash;It was a detachment of hor&s;e from the King's troops. Motionle&s;s and dumb, I heard the &s;hout of war&mdash;&s;aw both battles charge&mdash; when a trance relieved me from the agony of my fears. The fir&s;t object my eyes afterwards encoun|tered was an officer in the Briti&s;h uniform, who looked tenderly in my face, as if he had been anxiou&s;ly waiting my recovery. Oh, Charlotte! how &s;hall I de&s;cribe him to you?&mdash;Imagine a per&s;on, the mo&s;t captivating, manners the mo&s;t winningly poli&s;hed, and a countenance in which &s;weetne&s;s had &s;o tempered the manly daring of the &s;oldier, that, like Mars, when di&s;arming by the Graces, he appear'd re&s;igning the Laurel for the Myrtle of Love. I hear the mu&s;ic of his voice this moment.&mdash;"Madam," &s;aid he, taking me re&s;pectfully by the hand, <Q>you are no longer a pri&s;oner.&mdash;It gives me inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, that the nature of my orders will not allow me to &s;ee you &s;afe to the end of your journey; but if we ever meet again!</Q>&mdash;At the&s;e &s;ad words, the drums beat, and the trumpet blew its &s;ilver &s;um|mons; &mdash;my brother in the &s;ame in&s;tant urged the dangers of delay, and pre&s;&s;ed me to renew our jour|ney; &mdash;with reluctance and regret I yielded to his remon&s;trances; when turning round to take a parting look of my gallant &s;oldier, I found he was gone&mdash;the whole party had rode off at full &s;peed; in a few mi|nutes I could &s;ee nothing but a cloud of du&s;t, and for ever lo&s;t &s;ight of my deliverer.</P>

This was my method forty years ago in matters of bu&s;ine&s;s; a &s;ecret in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was trea&s;ure under-ground; no fund|ing it out in whi&s;pers and half-hints, to &s;et the Bulls and the Bears of curio&s;ity at work: I was as clo&s;e as an iron che&s;t; and had a knack of holding my tongue without ever looking the wi&s;er for it.&mdash;But this was all method; and whoever expects to thrive in the world, mu&s;t con&s;ider method as the foundation-&s;tone, upon which Trade builds the hou&s;e of Wealth and Pro&s;perity.</P>

<P>There is an in&s;tance in which nature her&s;elf did not ob&s;erve method; your father from his child|hood had a leaning to extravagance, and when the young &s;pendthrift had &s;quander'd away all his pocket money at &s;chool, I u&s;ed to advance him a fre&s;h &s;up|ply, at two-pence in the half-crown premium; why to this moment I have a particular hour in the day for doing every thing, and as the clock &s;trikes, my performance chimes echo to the &s;ound of it: but here is a curious calculation which I have made, that tells me, at a glance of the eye, how every hour of my life is di&s;po&s;ed of for twenty years to come <STAGE>[pulls out a pocket-book]</STAGE>: now mark, here's the third of Augu&s;t, ten in the morning, 1796, reading the General Even|ing Po&s;t, with my remarks upon the &s;iege of Gib|raltar.</P>

<P>Commanded la&s;t year on a &s;ecret expedi|tion through the interior part of South-Carolina, I met a woman, who at fir&s;t &s;ight made an impre&s;&s;ion on me I feel to this hour. She was taken pri&s;oner by the French, when I had the good fortune to be the in|&s;trument of her deliverance; but as my orders were to proceed by the mo&s;t rapid marches, I was obliged to quit her nearly in the in&s;tant I had re&s;cued her; and, what is wor&s;e, before I had an opportunity of knowing who &s;he was.</P>

<P>No, but I feared to a&s;k it; for you mu&s;t know, there was a gentleman with her, who, from his attention, I took to be her hu&s;band; then, whatever &s;ervants &s;he had were di&s;per&s;ed by the engagement, or I might have learned her name, and place of abode; but Fortune was my foe, and determined we never &s;hould meet: So now, at my father's earne&s;t reque&s;t, I have quitted the army, in order to take a wife he has cho&s;en for me, and forget this fair enchantre&s;s I have been &s;o long dreaming of.</P>

<P>You don't know, Ma'am, my good friend's character; was he even in love with you, and afterwards told of the mutual attachment between you and the Colonel, he would take a pride in re&s;igning his preten&s;ions.</P>

<P>I don' know how it is, Ma'am, but this conver&s;ation appears to me a kind of traver&s;e &s;ailing; and then a woman trims &s;o &s;harp, &s;he always gets the weather gage of me?</P>
