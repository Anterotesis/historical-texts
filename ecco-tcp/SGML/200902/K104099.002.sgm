<L>Or did you only nur&s;e my growing love,</L>
<L>That with more pain I might your hatred prove?</L>
<L>Sure guilty treachery no place cou'd find</L>
<L>In &s;uch a gentle, &s;uch a gen'rous mind:</L>

<HEAD>ADVICE to a LADY.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>THE coun&s;els of a friend, Belinda, hear,</L>
<L>Too roughly kind to plea&s;e a Lady's ear,</L>
<L>Unlike the flatt'ries of a lover's pen,</L>
<L>Such truths as women &s;eldom learn from men.</L>
<L>Nor think I prai&s;e you ill, when thus I &s;hew</L>
<L>What female Vanity might fear to know:</L>
<L>Some merit's mine, to dare to be &s;incere,</L>
<L>But greater your's, &s;incerity to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard is the fortune that your &s;ex attends;</L>
<L>Women, like Princes, find few real friends:</L>
<L>All who approach them their own ends pur&s;ue:</L>
<L>Lovers and mini&s;ters are &s;eldom true.</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="44">Hence oft from Rea&s;on heedle&s;s Beauty &s;trays,</L>
<L>And the mo&s;t tru&s;ted Guide the mo&s;t betrays:</L>

<L>When mo&s;t you tyrannize you're mo&s;t abus'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What is your &s;ex's earlie&s;t, late&s;t care,</L>
<L>Your heart's &s;upreme ambition? To be fair:</L>
<L>For this the toilet ev'ry thought employs,</L>
<L>Hence all the toils of dre&s;s, and all the joys:</L>
<L>For this, hands, lips, and eyes are put to &s;chool&punc;</L>
<L>And each in&s;tructive feature has its rule;</L>
<L>And yet how few have learnt, when this is giv'n.</L>
<L>Not to di&s;grace the partial boon of heav'n?</L>
<L>How few with all their pride of form can move?</L>
<L>How few are lovely, that were made for love?</L>

<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Edward being engaged in a war with France, for the obtaining that crown, in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners, with whom he might negotiate either for their per&s;onal &s;ervice, or aids of troops to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that undertaking, ordered, during the truce that then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two crowns, publication to be made of a great tournament, to be held at Wind&s;or; an expedient, &s;ays Rapin, which could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s, be|cau&s;e it was entirely agreeable to the ta&s;te of that age. Ac|cordingly many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction came over, to all of whom he gave an honourable reception, care&s;&s;ing them in &s;uch a manner that they could never &s;ufficiently admire his polite|ne&s;s, magnificence, and liberality. To render the&s;e entertain|ments the more &s;olemn, and to free him&s;elf al&s;o from the ce|remonies, to which the difference of rank and condition would have &s;ubjected him, he cau&s;ed a circular hall of boards to be run up at Wind&s;or, <HI>200</HI> feet in diameter. There it was that he fea&s;ted all the knights at one table, which was called the Round Table, in memory of the great Arthur, who, as it is pretended, in&s;tituted an order of knighthood by that name. Next year he cau&s;ed a more &s;olid building to be erected, that he might continue yearly the &s;ame diver|&s;ions. During that time he treated with the&s;e &s;everal lords about the aids, wherewith each could furni&s;h him, in proportion to his forces. His rival king Philip could not &s;ee without jealou&s;y, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Fle|mings, and Frenchmen them&s;elves flock to England to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the&s;e tournaments. He &s;u&s;pected &s;ome hidden de&s;ign in the&s;e ntertainments, and to break Edward's mea&s;ures, cau&s;ed the like to be publi&s;hed in his dominions; which meeting with &s;ucce&s;s, proved a countermine to Edward's main de&s;ign, &s;o that he did not long continue to keep up his round table. From thence, however, it is generally agreed, he took the fir&s;t hint of in&s;tituting the order of the Garter. But as his purpo&s;e in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table, as he had in this no private views, no ambitious &s;cheme of engaging &s;uch as &s;hould be admitted into this fraternity to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his wars, he thought proper, in order to obviate the like jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picion as had alarmed king Philip, to &s;ignify by his motto the purity of his intentions, and to retort &s;hame upon all tho&s;e who &s;hould put any malignant con&s;truction upon his de&s;ign in in&s;tituting this order. This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto, <HI>HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.</HI> The not under&s;tanding the purport of which, gave ri&s;e, in all probability, to that vulgar &s;tory of the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bu|ry's garter, rejected by all the be&s;t writers.</NOTE></L>
