<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the &s;mall Armoury.</HEAD>
<P>THE building it&s;elf, called the <HI>new Ar|moury,</HI> where the&s;e arms
<PB N="20" REF="18">are laid up, is a mo&s;t no|ble and magnificent &s;truc|ture. It &s;tands north of the White Tower, and ex|tends in length about a hundred and thirty yards, in depth about twenty. It was begun in the reign of king James the &s;econd, and fini&s;hed in king William's.</P>
<P>You go in at the we&s;t end of this grand build|ing, behind the chapel, and a&s;cend a &s;pacious and lofty
<PB N="21" REF="19">&s;tair-ca&s;e, at the head of which you turn to your right hand, and entering the room before you, you will &s;ee one of the greate&s;t, curio&s;ities, in its kind, ever formed by the art of man: Here are arms, we are told, &s;ufficient for a hundred thou&s;and men at a minute's warning, laid up in a mo&s;t &s;urprizing artificial order and beauty, all bright and clean to admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20">Ju&s;t within the door, on the left hand, are, fir&s;t, two lofty beatiful pyramids of pi&s;tols, &s;tanding upon the crown, globe and &s;ceptre, in curious carved work.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is called a wilderne&s;s of arms; that is, pikes, carbines, muskets, bayonets, halberts, &s;words, pi&s;tols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o laid up, that you have a pro&s;pect through all their ranges to the farther end of the
<PB N="23" REF="21">room, which is three hun|dred and forty-five feet long; the &s;ight of which is enough to &s;trike one with wonder and amaze|ment.</P>
<P>The third is a figure of arms taken at the Bath in the la&s;t rebellion in the year 1715.</P>
<P>Fourth, is the form of the waves of the &s;ea, made with &s;words.</P>
<P>Fifth, repre&s;ents half-moons
<PB N="24" REF="22">and fans, made with pi&s;tols and bayonets; and the form of a target in the middle made with bayo|net blades.</P>
<P>Sixth, two pillars of pikes, in imitation of flut|ed work, with fine carved capitals, of the Corinthian order.</P>
<P>Seventh, a pillar made of pikes and &s;words, for the &s;ea &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Eighth, are blunderbu&s;|&s;es
<PB N="25" REF="23">in the form of pillars, with capitals of pi&s;tols all the way up; and on both &s;ides bayonets in the form of the waves of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Ninth, carbines for the hor&s;e &s;ervice, and marine hangers &s;et in checquer-work.</P>
<P>Tenth, carbines for the hor&s;e, lined with pikes.</P>
<P>Eleventh, are &s;words and bayonets in the form of half-moons and fans, &s;et
<PB N="26" REF="24">upon &s;collop-&s;hells of fine carved work.</P>
<P>Twelfth, is the &s;un ri&s;|ing, repre&s;ented in a &s;quare frame, guarded with ma|rine hangers; and oppo&s;ite to that, in the middle of the room, are four beauti|ful twi&s;ted pillars, made with pi&s;tols up to the top, which is about twenty two feet, the heighth of the room: and in the centre of the&s;e pillars, is the
<PB N="27" REF="25">form of a dropping &s;tar, made of pi&s;tols; upon the left is the form of the &s;un &s;etting, made an&s;werable to that of its ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, repre&s;ents the form of a pair of gates, made with &s;erjeants hal|berts.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, are carbines hanging in &s;urbelows and flounces.</P>
<P>Fifteenth, is the form of a whale's backbone, made with carbines.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26">Sixteenth, repre&s;ents the grand witch of Endor, cal|led likewi&s;e Envy, or Me|du&s;a's head; with the fi|gures of &s;nakes &s;tinging her to death, made with three rows of pi&s;tols, &s;et with curious art; the features are of fine carved work.</P>
<P>Seventeenth, at the far|ther end of the room, on the left hand, is the ar|mour of king Henry the fifth, who conquered
<PB N="29" REF="27">France, with his flaming &s;word in his hand: he took more men pri&s;oners than he had in his army.</P>
<P>Next is the figure of a fiery &s;erpent, the head and tail of carved work, the body of pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>Facing the window, at the ea&s;t end, is the form of a large and beautiful organ, made with &s;ix thou|&s;and pi&s;tols, ten &s;tory, or ranges high.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28">Between the windows, at the &s;ame end, is the re|pre&s;entation of the Hydra, or &s;even-headed mon&s;ter; three of which heads are above, and four below, and not one like the other, all of carved work.</P>
<P>Next, is king Henry the &s;ixth's armour; he was crowned king of France: his father con|quered the country, and this prince lo&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">The fir&s;t curio&s;ity on the other &s;ide, coming back again, is the figure of Jupiter in his fiery chariot, drawn by eagles, in the clouds, with a thunderbolt in his hand, in carved work, guarded round with bayonets.</P>
<P>Second, is the &s;tar and garter made of pi&s;tols and bayonets; with the thi&s;tle, ro&s;e and crown over head, in carved work; and be|low,
<PB N="32" REF="30">are birds, and other curious creatures, in fine carved work.</P>
<P>All the way down, on this &s;ide, are the &s;ame fi|gures of arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> an|&s;werable to tho&s;e we de|&s;cribed in going up on the other.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, you are &s;hewn a great parcel of arms ta|ken in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination plot again&s;t king William, par|ticularly a blunderbus,
<PB N="33" REF="31">with which the con&s;pira|tors de&s;igned to have &s;hot that prince as he rid in his coach to Hampton-court; this hangs up over head: below, near the bottom, is a carbine, with which Charnock de&s;igned to have &s;hot him as he rode a hunting.</P>
<P>Hence are likewi&s;e &s;eve|ral arms taken in Scotland, in the la&s;t rebellion: par|ticularly a curious piece of
<PB N="34" REF="32">the late lord Mar's; and a large broad &s;word with which a highlander &s;truck general Evans, and cut him through his hat, wig, and skull-cap.</P>
<P>There are in this &s;mall Armoury, be&s;ides the&s;e principal curio&s;ities which I have mentioned, many fine things, which my young readers will be highly delighted to &s;ee. <HI>Here you pay</HI> Three-pence.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="33">The next curiou&s;ity is the train of artillery.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">

<P>THE grand &s;tore|hou&s;e where this curious train of artillery is kept, is directly under the &s;mall Armoury, upon the ground floor; where there

<PB N="37" REF="35">&s;mall &s;hot made up in bags.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Hor&s;e Armoury.</HEAD>
<P>HERE you are fir&s;t pre&s;ented with a
<PB N="45" REF="43">view of the &s;igures of the hor&s;e guards that attend the kings, whom you will &s;ee pre&s;ently all on hor&s;e|back in bright armour of poli&s;hed &s;teel, and ranged in beautiful order on the other &s;ide of the hou&s;e; as al&s;o of a great number of foot-guards, &s;tanding be|tween the hor&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Second, over head is the famous lance of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk,
<PB N="46" REF="44">king Henry the eighth's general in France.</P>
<P>Third, a &s;uit of tilting armour, with which the nobility and gentry u&s;ed to exerci&s;e, before guns were invented.</P>
<P>Fourth, a curious &s;uit of armour made for king Henry the eighth, rough from the hammer, and ne|ver filed.</P>
<P>Fifth, a little &s;uit of ar|mour for king Charles the
<PB N="47" REF="45">&s;econd, when he was prince of Wales; with a piece for his hor&s;e's head, of curious workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>Sixth, my lord Cour|cy's &s;uit of armour, great champion of Ireland; and the large two-handed &s;word he took from the champion of France: for which gallant action he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have the privilege of wearing their hats in the pre&s;ence of the
<PB N="48" REF="46">kings of England; which is continued to this day. The lord Kin&s;ale is now head of that noble family.</P>
<P>Seventh, a &s;uit of In|dian armour; &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to king Charles the &s;econd, from the great Mogul, which is &s;aid to be a defence again&s;t arrows, darts, and poi&s;oned lances, made u&s;e of in that coun|try.</P>
<P>Eighth, a little &s;uit of
<PB N="49" REF="47">armour made in remem|brance of Richard, duke of York, who, with his brother Edward the fifth, was &s;mothered in the Tower between two fea|ther-beds, about two hun|dred and fifty &s;even years ago; the former being about eleven years old, and the latter thirteen.</P>
<P>Ninth, John of Gaunt, duke of Lanca&s;ter's ar|mour; he was both &s;on
<PB N="50" REF="48">and father of a king, but never king him&s;elf. It is &s;aid he was &s;even feet four inches high.</P>
<P>Tenth, is the comical figure of Will. Somers, je&s;ter to king Henry the eighth.&mdash; He is called an hone&s;t man of woman's making&mdash;wears his horns upon his head to prevent the making holes in his pocket; and becau&s;e he was dim-&s;ighted, he would
<PB N="51" REF="49">believe neither the king, queen, nor any of the court, that he was a cuck|old, till he had put his &s;pectacles on; with which he is repre&s;ented by way of ridicule to this day.</P>
<P>Eleventh, is an ill fa|voured old in&s;trument, cal|led the <HI>collar of torment,</HI> which we are told was for|merly put about the necks of &s;uch women as either proved fal&s;e to their hu&s;|bands
<PB N="52" REF="50">beds, or took too great a freedom with their tongues.</P>
<Q><L>But long this collar has a&s;ide been ca&s;t.</L>
<L>Sure! they are now le&s;s noi&s;y, and more cha&s;te.</L></Q>
<P>Now we come to the kings on hor&s;e-back, who are placed in the following order: Fir&s;t, a curious figure
<PB N="53" REF="51">of king William the third.</P>
<P>Second, another of king Charles the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Third, of king Charles the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;uit of armour, which is &s;teel, richly gilt with gold, co&s;t, as we are informed, fifteen hundred pounds; and was a pre&s;ent from the city of London, when he was prince of Wales.</P>
<P>Fourth, of king James I.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="52">Fi&s;th of king Edward the &s;ixth, the fir&s;t prote|&s;tant prince that ever reign|ed in England: He was the royal founder of three ho&s;pitals, all which he gave to the city of Lon|don; <HI>viz.</HI> that of St. Tho|mas's for the relief of the &s;ick and the lame; Chri&s;t's Church for the &s;upport of freemens children, who are orphans; and Bridewell, for training up of youth,
<PB N="55" REF="53">and the encouragement of &s;everal u&s;eful branches of our Engli&s;h manufactures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sixth, a curious figure of king Henry the eighth.</P>
<P>Seventh, of Henry the &s;eventh, who killed crook|backed Richard the third, in Bo&s;worth-field, Leice&s;|ter&s;hire; &s;ome &s;hort time after he had &s;mothered his two young nephews in the Tower.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="54">Eighth, of Edward the fifth, who was proclaimed king, but was never crown|ed; the crown hanging over his head. He was &s;mothered with his bro|ther, as mentioned above.</P>
<P>Ninth, of Edward the fourth, father of the two la&s;t named princes. This king was remarkable for his gallantries with the citizens wives, particular|ly with the famous Jane Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="55">Tenth, of king Henry the &s;ixth, crowned al&s;o king of France, at Paris.</P>
<P>Eleventh, of Henry the fifth, who conquered France; the &s;ame prince whom we mentioned in our chapter <HI>Of the &s;mall Armoury,</HI> to have taken more men pri&s;oners than he had in his army.</P>
<P>Twelfth, of Henry the fourth, &s;on of John of Gaunt,</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="56">Thirteenth, of Edward the third, who was re|markable in having the kings of France and Scot|land pri&s;oners in England at one time; for which rea&s;on he wears two crowns upon his &s;word.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, of Edward the fir&s;t, who fought &s;eve|ral battles again&s;t the Turks and Infidedls in the holy land.</P>
<P>Fifteenth, a noble fi|gure
<PB N="59" REF="57">of William the con|queror, duke of Norman|dy.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the walls and cieling of this fine Armou|ry, where all the above|mentioned curio&s;ities are depo&s;ited, are every where ornamented with ancient brea&s;t-plates, &s;words, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For the &s;ight of the whole <HI>each per&s;on pays</HI> Two-pence.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58">I have now told my young readers all the fine things that I know of in this pompous place, ex|cepting one,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Regalia in the Jewel Office.</HEAD>
<P>THE ine&s;timable trea|&s;ures which we are now to give our young readers a particular ac|count of, are depo&s;ited or laid up in a dark, &s;trong &s;tone room, about twenty yards di&s;tant from the ea&s;t end of the new Armoury.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="60">Fir&s;t, the imperial crown, with which all the kings of England have been crowned &s;ince the time of Edward the confe&s;&s;or. It is a very rich crown of gold, embelli&s;hed with pearls and precious &s;tones of divers kinds; namely, diamonds, rubies, eme|ralds, and &s;aphires, with a mound of gold on the top of it, encircled with a band or fillet of gold; adorned
<PB N="63" REF="61">al&s;o with precious &s;tones, and three very large oval pearls; one on the top of the cro&s;s, and two others hanging at the end.</P>
<P>This crown is compo&s;|ed of four cro&s;&s;es, and as many flower de lis of gold, upon a rim or circlet of gold, all embelli&s;hed with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>The cap within is of purple velvet, lined with white taffety, and turned
<PB N="64" REF="62">up with ermine, thick powdered in three rows.</P>
<P>Second, the orb, or globe, which is put into the king's right hand im|mediately the king's right hand im|mediately before he is crowned, and borne in his left upon his return into We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.</P>
<P>It is a ball of gold, of &s;ix inches diameter, en|compa&s;&s;ed with a band or fillet of gold; embelli&s;hed with ro&s;es of diamonds
<PB N="65" REF="63">encircling other precious &s;tones, and edged about with pearl: on the top of it is a very large amethy&s;t, of a violet or purple co|lour, about and inch and an half in heighth, of an oval form; which being en|compa&s;&s;ed with four &s;ilver wires, makes the pede&s;tal of a very rich cro&s;s of gold, of three inches and a quarter in heighth and three in breadth, &s;et very
<PB N="66" REF="64">thich with diamonds; hav|ing in the middle thereof a fair &s;aphire on one &s;ide, and a fair emerald on the other, embelli&s;hed with four large pearls in the corners of the cro&s;s, near its centre, and three large pearls at the end of the &s;aid cro&s;s.</P>
<P>The whole heighth of the ball and cro&s;s together is eleven inches.</P>
<P>Third, the royal &s;cep|tre
<PB N="67" REF="65">with the cro&s;s, which has another jewel of great value under it.</P>
<P>It is of fine gold; the handle plain, and the up|per part wreathed: It is in length two foot nine inches and a quarter, and in compa&s;s three inches at the handle, and two and a quarter about the top. The pommel at the bot|tom enriched with rubies, emeralds, and &s;mall dia|monds.
<PB N="68" REF="66">The top ri&s;es in|to a flower de lis of &s;ix leaves; three whereof are upright, and three hang|ing down, all enriched with precious &s;tones. Out of the &s;ame flower de lis iffueth a mound or ball, made of an amethy&s;t, gar|ni&s;hed with table dia|monds: and upon the mound or cro&s;s quite co|vered with precious &s;tones, with a large table diamond in the centre.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67">Fourth, the &s;ceptre with the dove, of fine gold, in length three feet &s;even in|ches, and three inches a|bout at the handle, and two and a quarter at the top. The pommel gar|ni&s;hed with a circle or fil|let let of table diamonds, and in &s;everal places with pre|cious &s;tones of all &s;orts. The mound or ball at the top, embelli&s;hed with ro&s;e diamonds; and on the top
<PB N="70" REF="68">of all a &s;mall Jeru&s;alem cro&s;s, whereon is fixed a dove with wings expand|ed, as the emblem of peace and mercy.</P>
<P>Fifth, Saint Edward's &s;taff, all beaten gold, in length four feet &s;even in|ches and a half, and about three inches and three quarters in circumference. This &s;taff, which is gar|ni&s;hed al&s;o with gold, is carried before the king at his coronation.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="69">Sixth, a rich &s;alt|cellar or &s;tate, made in the form of the &s;quare whire Tow|er; which is wrought with &s;uch exqui&s;ite art, that words cannot well expre&s;s it. This inimitable piece of gold plate is u&s;ed at all coronations.</P>
<P>Seventh, the <HI>curtann,</HI> or pointle&s;s &s;word of mer|cy. This is a broad bright &s;word, the blade thirty two inches in length, and al|mo&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="70">two broad: the han|dle is covered with a fine gold wire four inches, be|&s;ides the pommel an inch and three quarters, which with the cro&s;s is plain &s;tell gilt: the length of the cro&s;s being almo&s;t eight inches. This &s;word of mercy is borne naked be|fore the king at his coro|nation, between the &s;piri|tual and temporal &s;words of ju&s;tices, of which it is the cheif.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="71">Eighth, a noble &s;ilver font, double gilt, in which the royal family are chri&s;t|ned. This is likewi&s;e a great curio&s;ity with re|&s;pect to its workman&s;hip, antiquity, and &s;olemn u&s;e, and is highly worthy of our young readers ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>Ninth, a large &s;ilver fountain double gilt, which was a magnificent pre&s;ent from the town of Ply|mouth
<PB N="74" REF="72">to their royal ma&s;|ter king Charles the &s;e|cond; the workman&s;hip whereof is very curious, and the value very great.</P>
<P>Tenth, the rich crown of &s;tate which his maje&s;ty wears on his throne in par|liament. It is embelli&s;hed with divers large ro&s;e and table diamonds, and other precious &s;tones; but mo&s;t remarkable for a wonder|ful large ruby &s;et in the
<PB N="75" REF="73">middle of one of the cro&s;|&s;es, vauled at ten thou&s;and pounds and upwards: as al&s;o for the large emerald which is &s;even inches round; a pearl, the fine&s;t in the world; and a ruby of ine&s;timable value.</P>
<P>Eleventh, his royal high|ne&s;s the prince of Wales's rich crown.</P>
<P>This and the crown of &s;tate la&s;t mentioned, when|ever his maje&s;ty goes to
<PB N="76" REF="74">the parliament-hou&s;e, are carried by the keeper of the jewel-office, attended by one or two of the war|ders of the Tower, pri|vately in a hackney coach to White-hall; where they are delivered to the proper officers, who with &s;ome yeomen of the guard car|ry them to the robing rooms, where his maje&s;ty and the prince dre&s;s them|&s;elves. His maje&s;ty wears
<PB N="77" REF="75">his crown on his head whil&s;t on the throne, and that belonging to the prince is placed before him, to &s;hew that he is heir apparent to the crown. After the king has le&s;t the hou&s;e, and is di&s;robed, both the &s;aid crowns are conveyed back to the Tower in the &s;ame privated manner.</P>
<P>Twelfth, the rich crown of &s;tate, with the globe,
<PB N="78" REF="76">&s;ceptre, and diadem, which queen Mary, the con&s;ort of his late maje&s;y king William the third, wore in proceeding to her co|ronation.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, an ivory &s;ceptre with a dove on the top, made for the late king James's queen. This is in length three feet one inch and a half, the pom|mel whereof and garna|ture is gold, as is al&s;o the
<PB N="79" REF="77">mound which cro&s;&s;es the top. The dove is gold enamelled white; at the bottom it is about two inches round, at the top an inch and an half, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, the golden &s;purs, which are very large and ma&s;&s;y, and curiou&s;ly wrought, of great antiqui|ty, and are worn at coro|nations; as are the <HI>armil|la's,</HI> which are golden
<PB N="80" REF="78">bracelets for wri&s;ts.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the <HI>ampulla,</HI> or eagle, of pur gold finely engraved, which holds the holy oil the kings and queens of England are an|ointed with. It &s;tands on a pede&s;tal with its wings expanded. The head &s;crews off at the middle of the neck, for the conve|niency of pouring in the oil; the neck being hollow to the beak; the holy oil
<PB N="81" REF="79">is poured out into the large golden &s;poon &s;et a|part for that purpo&s;e, thro' the point of the beak; the heighth of this gol|den eagle from bottom to top, including the pede|&s;tal of foot, is about nine inches; the wings where|of expand about &s;even in|ches. The weight of the whole is about ten ounces. This and the &s;poon are curio&s;ities of great antiqui|ty.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="80">There are, be&s;ides the ine&s;timable trea&s;ures above particularly mentioned, &s;e|veral cuirous and valuable pieces of plate and other rich furniture, not u&s;ually expo&s;ed to publick view; a particular de&s;cription of which would be too redi|ous to be here in&s;erted.</P>
<P>However, for the fur|ther information and a|mu&s;ement of our little readers, we &s;hall clo&s;e this
<PB N="83" REF="81">chapter with a poetical account of the bold and unparalleled attempt of a de&s;perate villain, with o|thers of his a&s;&s;ociates, to &s;trip the jewel-office of the royal crown, globe, &s;ceptre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the happy prevention of their wicked de&s;ign; in which had they &s;ucceeded, the lo&s;s could never have been repaired.</P>

<P>THE line is a nar|row, neat, paved way, ju&s;t within the bat|tlements of the wall which &s;urrounds the Tower; up|on this line, which is about half a mile in compa&s;s, are four batteries, which by means thereof have an

<HEAD>Of the Devil's Battery.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HEAR now, young readers, how it came,</L>
<L>To bear that hideous, frightful name:</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="104">The tale is merry, tho' 'tis old:</L>
<L>Then take it, as to me 'twas told.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As once a centinel was put.</L>
<L>To guard this little ea&s;tern &s;pot;</L>
<L>Soon as 'twas dark, before his eyes</L>
<L>A &s;hocking &s;pectre did ari&s;e,</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="105">Of bulk enormous, full as tall</L>
<L>As either giant in Guildhall:</L>
<L>And what &s;till made him look the bolder,</L>
<L>He bore a cannon on his &s;houlder.</L>
<L>The &s;oldier frighten'd quits his po&s;t,</L>
<L>And looks as pale as any gho&s;t;</L>
<L>Flies to his corporal, who was near,</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="106">And tells the ground-work of his fear.</L>
<L>Ble&s;s me! he cry'd, what &s;hall. I do?</L>
<L>I've &s;een old Satan&mdash; 'faith! 'tis true.</L>
<L>Return, for &s;hame, the corporal &s;aid,</L>
<L>Let's go and &s;hoot old Satan dead.</L>
<L>Onwards they march&mdash; the corporal &s;pies</L>
<L>The devil with his &s;aweer eyes.</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="107">Fearles at once Don Quixote fir'd;</L>
<L>Down dropt the devil, or retir'd.</L>
<L>Hence, let the fact be how it will,</L>
<L>'Tis call'd the devil's bettery &s;till.</L>

<P>From this battery, at about two hundred yards di&s;tance, you come to a &s;pacious, &s;trong, &s;tone battery, where there are
<PB N="110" REF="108">eight large iron cannon mounted. This battery is at the north corner of the ea&s;t end of the Tower.&mdash; From thence you pa&s;s on to the fourth battery, where there are &s;ix guns, which point towards the north. The guns are fired from all the&s;e batte|ries, and from tho&s;e al&s;o of the wharf, on &s;ome particular rejoicing days, &s;uch as the king's birth|day,
<PB N="111" REF="109">being the 30th of October, and his return from abroad; and from the wharf alone, on all other royal holidays, and likewi&s;e as often as his maje&s;ty goes to the parlia|ment hou&s;e, and on the 29th of May, 5th of No|vember, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From the la&s;t battery we proceed to the royal mint, where all the gold, &s;ilver, and copper coins
<PB N="112" REF="110">and medals are &s;truch; be|longing to the manage|ment of which there are &s;everal officers, of whom the warden is chief.</P>
<P>I could very willingly give my young readers a particular account of the art of making of money, but I am afraid it might tempt &s;ome naughty per|&s;ons to counterfeit, the current coin, for which I &s;hould be ju&s;tly blamed,
<PB N="113" REF="111">and become in &s;ome mea|&s;ure acce&s;&s;ary to the fatal con&s;enquences that might attend it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the in&s;ide of the White tower.</HEAD>
<P>I Mu&s;t fir&s;t inform my young readers, that the in&s;ide of this grand Tow|er
<PB N="114" REF="112">is not publickly &s;hewn, but as they, in proceeding from one place to the o|ther, in order to &s;ee the rarities, pa&s;s by it two or three times, and will very likely be inqui&s;itive to know what is with in&s;ide, I &s;hall therefore endeavour to &s;atisfy their curiou&s;ity.</P>
<P>This Tower is a large magazine, or va&s;t &s;tore|hou&s;e, filled with prodi|gious numbers of various
<PB N="115" REF="113">kinds of in&s;truments. of war: The vaults, which perhaps are the large&s;t and fine&s;t in all the world, are filled with bags of &s;alt pe|tre, for the making of gunpowder. Upon the fir&s;t &s;loor are &s;everal &s;pa|cious rooms; one of which is a &s;mall armoury for the &s;ea &s;ervice, for ten thou|&s;and men. Which arms are of various &s;orts, very cu|rious, and laid up in beau|tiful order.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="114">In another room are a multitude of fine clo&s;ets, pre&s;&s;es and lockers, all fil|led with an almo&s;t incre|dible number of tools for the war &s;ervice. As to gunpowder, there is but little kept in this place, only &s;o much as will &s;erve for the u&s;e of the garri|&s;on. This Tower has three very high &s;tories, and, upon the top of all, fine leads; and, what is
<PB N="117" REF="115">&s;urprizing, water from the Thames is forced by an engine to the top of this lofty Tower; where it fills a ci&s;tern of about &s;even feet deep, nine broad, and about &s;ixty feet in length: being the bigge&s;t that I ever &s;aw or heard of.</P>
<P>The walls of this &s;trong Tower, are, at the ground|floor, one and twenty feet thick; at the &s;econd,
<PB N="118" REF="116">about &s;ixteen feet, and at the third about &s;even feet thick. At the &s;outh &s;ide of this White Tower is a room, formerly a chapel, where are kept the ancient records of this nation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next tell my rea|ders the time and ceremo|ny of opening and &s;hut|ting the gates of the Tow|er, and &s;o conclude this hi&s;tory.</P>

<PB N="119" REF="117">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the ceremony of opening and &s;hutting the gates of the Tower.</HEAD>
<P>AT half an hour after nine o'clock at night the bell on the top of the governor's hou&s;e rings, to warn the inhabitants or others to go out, or come into the garri&s;on, as their
<PB N="120" REF="118">affairs may require: At the &s;ame time the drum beats over the &s;pur guard, at the entrance into the Tower, to give notice to the &s;oldiers who are ab|&s;ent from duty, to come in; likewi&s;e at ten a-clock the tattoo beats, <HI>Go to bed, Tom,</HI> from the main guard, which is at the we&s;t &s;ide of the white Tower, quite round the Tower, to the place from whence they &s;et out.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="119">At eleven o'clock (which is the hour they lock up the gates, both in winter and &s;ummer) the yeoman porter calls a &s;erjeant and a file fo men to attend the keys to lock up the royal Tower; who pro|ceed with him to the &s;pur guard, or outer gates, which being &s;ecured, they go back to the main guard; where the yeoman porter cries, <HI>God ble&s;s the king;</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="120">the guard, who are drawn. up in order, an&s;wer <HI>Amen:</HI> From thence they go to the governor's hou&s;e, where they lodge the keys; after which no per&s;on, up|on any account what&s;o|ever, can either go out or come into the Tower, till next morning; when the &s;ame ceremony is again ob&s;erved at opening the gates; in the &s;ummer at half an hour after five,
<PB N="123" REF="121">and in the winter at &s;even.</P>
<P>About half and hour after nine, before they look up the Tower, one of the warders, with a guard of &s;oldiers upon duty, locks up the gates upon the wharf, and, drawing up the draw-bridge, locks the gate which leads to it, and &s;o retires into the Tower, after which no per&s;on can go out, or come in.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122">Having now &s;hut the gates of the Tower, I have nothing more to add concerning the curio&s;ities of this place &mdash; but I beg leave to inform my young readers, that the <HI>Hi&s;tory of We&s;tmin&s;ter Ab|bey</HI> is now in hand, and will be got ready for the pre&s;s with all convenient &s;peed: Sub&s;cribers are de|&s;ired to bring or &s;end their names to <HI>Thomas Boreman</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="123">Book&s;eller in Guildhall, or at the Boot and Crown on Ludgate-hill, London; and they &s;hall be carefully in&s;erted with due order and di&s;tinction; each pay|ing down <HI>Six-pence</HI> a Set in part at &s;ub&s;cribing, it being a large and expen|&s;ive undertaking.</P>
