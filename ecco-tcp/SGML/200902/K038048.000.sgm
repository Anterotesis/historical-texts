<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader is reque&s;ted to con&s;ider this Performance as a GENERAL OUTLINE, with here and there &s;ome &s;ketched features, of a Work, the nature of which, is frequently alluded to in different parts of the Poem, and the Title is &s;pecified on a &s;eparate leaf at the end.</P>
<P>What I ventured abroad &s;ome years &s;ince under the title of SYMPATHY&mdash;a poem, which on account of the intere&s;ts created in the Heart, by the &s;ubject it&s;elf, was received by the Public with &s;o much generous warmth&mdash;was intended to &s;erve as a Preliminary to what I had farther to ob&s;erve on SOCIETY, or a Pro&s;pect of the HUMAN RACE, under the combined in|fluences of CLIME and GOVERNMENT, RELIGIONS, LAWS and LIBERTIES&mdash;From the&s;e, the tran&s;ition to TYRANNY was natu|ral and &s;trongly in connexion; and from TYRANNY, I felt my|&s;elf called upon by all the awakened emotions of HUMANITY, to con&s;ider SLAVERY; but not only that &s;pecies of it which con&s;i&s;ts in buying and &s;elling our <HI>Fellow-Creatures</HI> in Africa&mdash;BUT EVERY OTHER KIND, in EVERY OTHER PLACE. Views, therefore, of FREEDOM and BONDAGE, throughout the different parts of the globe, have been taken, as well from experience, as the be&s;t hi&s;torical evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">In the order of my Poem on SOCIETY, perhaps the part which relates to the Inhuman <HI>Treatment</HI> of Negroes (for the <HI>Treat|ment</HI> appears to me more criminal than the <HI>Traffic</HI>) might not have taken the lead; not from any idea that the&s;e unhappy Be|ings are le&s;s entitled to the Rights of Nature, or the Regulations of Society, then any other parts of the HUMAN SPECIES; but, becau&s;e, according to the &s;eries I meant to ob&s;erve, the Pro&s;pect of the quarter of the Globe where this Trade principally &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, would have been out of time and place. This objection being done away by the emulative Benevolence which is now excited in the Empire on this &s;ubject, it affords me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure that, by an <HI>anticipation</HI> of &s;o much of what I had to remark on AFRICA as is confined to the Slave Trade (which, however, by no means exhau&s;ts what remains <HI>yet</HI> to be &s;aid in that divi&s;ion of my future work) I have a fair opportunity, and at a &s;ea&s;onable moment, to enforce the appeals of tho&s;e who have the &s;tronge&s;t claims on HUMANITY, in a performance devoted to its <HI>general</HI> intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>How far the <HI>entire Abolition,</HI> &s;o warmly contended for by the &s;upporters of this mea&s;ure, may be con&s;i&s;tent with human policy, it is not my purpo&s;e particularly to enquire. It is not the <HI>name</HI> of Slave in <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> which produces the great mi&s;|chief. An hired &s;ervant in Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope may be as little at his own command, and de&s;tined to as hard labour as a purcha&s;ed Negro in Africa; but the e&s;&s;ential difference con&s;i&s;ts in the one being guarded by the laws of the land, which &s;pread before his per&s;on and his property a &s;hield that defends him from every <HI>abu&s;e of power;</HI> and the other is left naked and defencele&s; to the "in&s;o|lence of office."</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">HUMANITY requires that the RIGHTS OF NATURE &s;hould be enjoyed by every <HI>Human Being.</HI> It is therefore again&s;t the &s;hock|ing barbarity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am glad, however, to have it in my power to ob&s;erve, that we have not &s;uffered the HUMANITY of the French and other nations to &s;urpa&s;s our own, at lea&s;t in <HI>one</HI> of our i&s;lands, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the following authentic extract from the Jamaica Councils will atte&s;t, dated <HI>November</HI> 20th, 1787.</P>
<P>"This day the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly went into a Committee on the Con&s;olidated Slave Bill, and continued &s;itting upwards of three hours; we under&s;tand, that by this Bill the whole &s;y&s;tem of the law re&s;pecting Negroes, is entirely changed, a Council of Protection is e&s;tab|li&s;hed in each pari&s;h, and many humane provi&s;ions are introduced for rendering their con|dition ea&s;y and happy; it is al&s;o made felony, without benefit of clergy, to murder a Slave, a clau&s;e, which, to the great honour of the Hou&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed without a &s;ingle di&s;&s;enting voice.</P></NOTE> the unque&s;tionable cruelty, and the too well-atte&s;t|ed horror, growing out of the&s;e, that I contend.&mdash;An abolition of <HI>the&s;e enormities</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. For the re&s;t, whether the commerce flouri&s;hes or falls, is a matter of no moment to the Philanthropi&s;t: without engaging in the heats of political contro|ver&s;y; without attending to the pleas of intere&s;t on the one &s;ide, or the &s;allies of enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal (though generous in its exce&s;&s;es) on the other, it is &s;ufficient to Him that the happine&s;s of the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> is made independent on the tyranny of <HI>particu|lar individuals,</HI>&mdash;that the laws of <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> in the different cla&s;&s;es of SOCIETY, &s;hould not violate the laws of <HI>humanity,</HI>&mdash;and that &s;o much of <HI>liberty</HI> &s;hould be allowed to every man, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to feel a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his being a link in the great chain of the community; and that till by &s;ome act of his own it is nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>good of the whole</HI> that he &s;hould be con&s;idered as an outca&s;t of &s;ociety, he is, by the Rights of nature and of Rea|&s;on, entitled to protection from in&s;ult, mi&s;ery and death.&mdash;So far as the <HI>wealth,</HI> can be reconciled to the <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> of nations, and the E&s;tabli&s;hments of Civil <HI>Society</HI> to the Rights of Nature,
<PB N="iv" REF="6">every lover of his country mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe: at the fame time, as the <HI>wealth of worlds</HI> cannot ju&s;tify the lea&s;t wanton infraction of the <HI>laws of Humanity,</HI> whoever vainly attempts to &s;upport an argu|ment for the one, at the expence of the other, erects a building which hath its foundation in the &s;ands, and which mu&s;t tumble into ruins at the &s;lighte&s;t touch of Rea&s;on and of Truth.</P>
<P>Under this plain Conviction, I have felt and written, and &s;hall continue to feel and write, upon <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Slavery, Humanity</HI> and <HI>Nature;</HI> and I now &s;ubmit my Sentiments to the candid, con&s;ider|ation of the Public, without any undue con&s;idence of &s;ucce&s;s, or unmanly dread of mi&s;carriage.&mdash;I have not thru&s;t upon the world, what I wi&s;h it to honour with notice, without the pre|vious approbation of &s;ome great, and good minds; but (very contrary to the ca&s;e with which in earlier life I u&s;ed to reconcile my&s;elf to ha&s;ty publication) were I not now to go to pre&s;s till I was <HI>&s;atisfied with my own performance,</HI> tho&s;e who&s;e partiality di&s;po&s;es them to prai&s;e, would blame me for unrea&s;onable delay; and tho&s;e, who are more prone to cen&s;ure, would no more be indebted to me for furni&s;hing them with &s;ubject for the exerci&s;e of their favourite talent. On every great and national occa&s;ion, however, our country has a claim on the be&s;t &s;ervices we have to offer; and wherever they fall &s;hort of our wi&s;hes, or even of our own conceptions, the proverbial apology, that the <Q>Intention &s;anctifies the Deed,</Q> ought to operate in our favour. Should the deed, in any mea&s;ure, do ju&s;tice to the intentions, in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> in&s;tance, applau&s;e will not be withheld, but it will only &s;erve to animate my future exertions, to prove more de&s;erving of it.</P>
