<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Letter to you from an Engli&s;h author will carry with it the appearance of corre&s;ponding with the enemy, not only as the two nations are at pre&s;ent involved in a difficult and important war, but al&s;o becau&s;e in many of your late writings you &s;eem determined to live in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with the Bri|ti&s;h nation. Whenever we come in your way, <Q>we are ferocious, we are i&s;landers, we are the people whom your country has taught, we fall behind other nations in point of ta&s;te and elegance of compo&s;ition; the &s;ame cau&s;e that has witheld from us a genius for painting and mu&s;ic, has al&s;o deprived us of the true &s;pirit of Tragedy; and, in &s;hort, barbari&s;m &s;till pre|vails among us.</Q></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this vein of prejudice, which has di&s;coloured almo&s;t all your <HI>fugitivepieces,</HI> there &s;till breathes throughout your writings &s;uch a general &s;pirit of Hu|manity and zeal for the Honour of the Republic of Let|ters, that I am inclined to imagine the author of the Engli&s;h Orphan of China (an ob&s;cure i&s;lander) may &s;till addre&s;s you upon terms of amity and literary bene|volence.</P>
<P>As I have attempted a Tragedy upon a &s;ubject that has exerci&s;ed your excellent talents, and thus have dared to try my &s;trength in the Bow of ULYSSES, I hold my|&s;elf in &s;ome fort accountable to M. DeVOLTAIRE for the departure I have made from his plan, and the &s;ub&s;titu|tion of a new fable of my own.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t propen&s;ity to this &s;tory was occa&s;ioned by the remarks of an admirable critic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hurd, in his Commentary upon Horace.</NOTE> of our own. upon the

ORPHAN OF THE HOUSE OF CHAU, pre&s;erved to us by the indu&s;trious and &s;en&s;ible P. DU HALDE, which, as our learned commentator ob&s;erves, amid&s;t great wild|ne&s;s and irregularity, has &s;till &s;ome traces of re&s;emblance to the beautiful models of antiquity. In my reflections upon this piece, I imagined I &s;aw a blemi&s;h in the man|ner of &s;aving the Orphan, by the tame re&s;ignation of an|other infant in his place; e&s;pecially when the &s;ubject af|forded &s;o fair an opportunity of touching the &s;trugglings of a parent, on &s;o trying an occa&s;ion. It therefore oc|curred to me, if a fable could be framed, in which the Father and the two Young Men might be interwoven with probability and per&s;picuity, and not embarra&s;&s;ed with all the perplexities of a riddle, as, you know, is the ca&s;e of the HERACLIUS of CORNEILLE, that then many &s;ituations might ari&s;e, in which &s;ome of the neare&s;t affections of the heart might be awakened: but even then I was too con&s;cious that it mu&s;t be executed by a genius very different from my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of mind, &s;ir, I heard with plea&s;ure that M. De VOLTAIRE had produced at Paris his L'ORPHELIN DE LA CHINE: I ardently longed for a peru&s;al of the piece, expecting that &s;uch a writer would certainly &s;eize all the &s;triking incidents which might naturally grow out of &s;o pregnant a &s;tory, and that he would leave no &s;ource of pa&s;&s;ion unopened. I was in &s;ome &s;ort, but not wholly di&s;appointed: I &s;aw M. De VOLTAIRE ru&s;hing into the mid&s;t of things at once; opening his &s;ubject in an alarming manner; and, after the narrative relating to GENGISKAN is over, working up his fir&s;t act like a poet indeed.</P>
<P>Meum qui pectus inaniter angit Ut Magus.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the &s;econd act, he again touches the pa&s;&s;ions with a ma&s;ter-hand; but, like a rower who
<PB N="91" REF="100">
has put forth all his &s;trength, and &s;uddenly &s;lackens his exertion, I &s;aw, or imagined I &s;aw, him give way all at once; the great tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions is over; the intere&s;t wears away; GENGISKAN talks politics; the tenderne&s;s of a mother, flying with all the &s;trong im|pul&s;es of nature to the relief of her child, is thrown in|to cold unimpa&s;&s;ioned narrative; the <HI>role pour Pamoureux</HI> mu&s;t have its place, and the rough conqueror of a whole people mu&s;t in&s;tantly become <HI>Le Chevalier</HI> GENGISKAN, as errant a lover as ever &s;ighed in the Thuilleries at Paris. Your own words, &s;ir, &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of that manly and &s;en&s;ible ta&s;te, which di&s;tingui&s;hes you through|out Europe, occurred to me upon this occa&s;ion: <Q>Quelle place pour la galanterie que le parricide &amp; l'ince&s;te, qui de&s;olent une famille, &amp; la contagion qui ravage un pais? Et quel exemple plus frapant du ridicule de notre theatre, &amp; du pouvoir de l'habitude, que Corneille d'un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, qui fait dire &agrave; Th&eacute;&s;&eacute;e.&mdash;</Q></P>

<P><Q>L'ab&s;ence aux vrais amans e&s;t encore plus fune&s;te.

<PB N="92" REF="101">
would give relating to the delivery of his country, &s;hould an&s;wer, "aucune," none at all.&mdash;And yet this is the language of a northern conqueror, whining for a man|darin's wife, who has no power of re&s;i&s;ting, and hav|ing no relation to the royal family, could not, by an intermarriage, &s;trengthen his intere&s;t in the crown But to you, &s;ir, who have told us that Love &s;hould reign a very tyrant in Tragedy, or not appear there at all, being unfit for the &s;econd place; to you, who have &s;aid that NERO &s;hould not hide him&s;elf behind a tape&s;try to overhear the conver&s;ation of his mi&s;tre&s;s and his rival, what need I urge the&s;e remarks?&mdash;To fill up the long career of a tragedy with this epi&s;odic love mu&s;t certainly have been the motive that led you into this er|ror; an error I take the liberty to call it, becau&s;e I have ob&s;erved it to be the hackneyed and &s;tale &s;tratagem, of many modern writers. Within the compa&s;s of my reading, there is hardly a bad man in any play, but he is in love with &s;ome very good woman: the &s;cenes that pa&s;s between them, I have always remarked, are found dull and unawakening by the audience, even though adorn|ed with all the graces of &s;uch compo&s;ition as yours, of which it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that it be&s;tows embel|li&s;hments upon every &s;ubject.</P>
<P>For me, &s;ir, who only draw in crayons, who have no re&s;ource to tho&s;e la&s;ting colours of imagination with which you &s;et off every thing; a writer &s;uch as I am, &s;ir, could not pre&s;ume to &s;upport that duplicity of pa&s;|&s;ion which runs through your piece. I could not pre|tend, by the powers of &s;tyle, to &s;uborn an audience in favour of tho&s;e &s;econdary pa&s;&s;ages, from which their at|tention naturally revolts. A plainer and more &s;imple method lay before me. I was nece&s;&s;itated to keep the main object as much as po&s;&s;ible before the eye; and therefore it was that I took a &s;urvey of my &s;ubject, in order to catch at every thing that &s;eemed to me to re|&s;ult

with order and propriety from it. A &s;cantine&s;s of intere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed to me a primary defect in the con&s;truction of the French ORPHAN OF CHINA, and that I imagined had its &s;ource in the early date of your play. By beginning almo&s;t "gemino ab ovo," by mak|ing the Orphan and the mandarine's &s;on children in their cradles, it appeared to me that you had &s;tripped your&s;elf of two characters, which might be produced in an amiable light, &s;o as to engage the affections of their auditors, not only for them&s;elves, but con&s;equently for tho&s;e al&s;o to whom they &s;hould &s;tand in any degree of relation. From this conduct I propo&s;ed a further advantage, that of taking off the very obvious re&s;emblance to the ANDROMACHE, which now &s;trikes every body in your plan. This la&s;t remark I do not urge again&s;t acciden|tal and di&s;tant coincidencies of &s;entiment, diction, or fable. Many of the Greek plays, we know, had a family-likene&s;s, &s;uch as an OEDIPUS, an ELECTRA, an IPHI|GENIA in TAURIS, in AULIS, a MEROPE, &amp;c. But what is a beauty in RACINE, &s;eems in his great &s;ucce&s;&s;or to be a blemi&s;h. In the former, nothing depends on the life of ASTYANAX but what was very natural, the happine&s;s of the mother: in the latter, the fate of a kingdom is grafted upon the fortunes of an infant; and I a&s;k your own feelings, (for no body knows the human heart better) Whether an audience is likely to take any con&s;iderable intere&s;t in the de&s;tiny of a babe, who, when your Zamti has &s;aved him, cannot produce any change, any revolution in the affairs of China? No, &s;ir; the conquered remain in the &s;ame abject &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, and the pre&s;ervation of the infant king becomes therefore unintere&s;ting and unimportant. He might die, &s;ir, in cutting his teeth, of the hooping cough, or any of the di&s;orders attendant on that tender age: whereas when the Orphan is grown up to maturity, when he is a moral agent in the piece, when a plan is laid for revenging
<PB N="94" REF="103">
him&s;elf on the de&s;troyers of his family, it then becomes a more pre&s;&s;ing motive in the mandarine's mind; nay, it is almo&s;t his duty, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to &s;acrifice even his own offspring for the good of his country. In your &s;tory, &s;ir, give me leave to &s;ay, I do not &s;ee what end can be an&s;wered by ZAMTI'S loyalty: his pro&s;pect is at lea&s;t &s;o di&s;tant, that it becomes almo&s;t chimerical. And therefore as hi&s;tory warrants an expul&s;ion of the Tartars, as it was not upon the fir&s;t inroad, but in pro|ce&s;s of time and experience, that they learned to incor|porate them&s;elves with the conquered, I had recour&s;e to my own preconceived notions. Whether I was partially attached to them, or whether my rea&s;onings upon your fable were ju&s;t, you, &s;ir, and the public, will determine.</P>
<P>You will perceive, &s;ir, in the Engli&s;h Orphan &s;ome occa&s;ional in&s;ertions of &s;entiment from your elegant per|formance. To u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of the late Mr. DRYDEN, when he talks of BEN JOHNSON'S imitation of the ancients, you <HI>will often track me in your &s;now.</HI> For this I &s;hall make no apology, either to the public or you: none to the public, becau&s;e they have applauded &s;ome &s;trokes for which I am indebted to you; and none certainly to you, becau&s;e you are well aware I have but followed the example of many admired writers; BOI|LEAU, CORNEILLE, and RACINE, with you; and in England, MILTON, Mr. ADDISON, and Mr. POPE. It was finely &s;aid by you, (I have read the &s;tory, and take it upon tru&s;t) when it was objected to the celebrated abb&egrave; METASTASIO; as a reproach, that he had frequent transfu&s;ions of thought from your writings, <Q>Ah! le cher volcur! il m'a bien embelli.</Q> This talent of embelli&s;hing I do not pretend to; to avail my&s;elf of my reading, and to improve my own productions, is all I can pretend to; and that I flatter my&s;elf I have done, not only from you, but many of the writers of antiquity. If the authorities I have abovementioned were not &s;uffi|cient, I could add another very bright example, the
<PB N="95" REF="104">
example of M. De VOLTAIRE, whom I have often tracked, to u&s;e the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion again, in the <HI>&s;now of Shake&s;pear.</HI> The &s;now of SHAKESPEAR is but a cold expre&s;&s;ion; but perhaps it will be more agreeable to you, than a word of greater energy, that &s;hould convey a full idea of the a&s;toni&s;hing powers of that great man; for we i&s;landers have remarked of late, that M. DeVoltaire has a particular &s;atisfaction in de&s;canting on the faults of the mo&s;t wonderful genius that ever exi&s;ted &s;ince HOMER; in&s;omuch that a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance tells me, that whenever you treat the Engli&s;h bard as a drunken &s;avage in your <HI>avant propos,</HI> he always deems it a &s;ure progno&s;tic that your play is the better for him.</P>
<P>If the great &s;cenes of SHAKESPEAR, &s;ir; if his boundle&s;s view of all nature, the lawn, the wilder|ne&s;s, the bla&s;ted heath, mountains, and craggy rocks, with thunder and lightening on their brows; if the&s;e cannot &s;trike the imagination of M. De VOL|TAIRE, how can I expect that the &s;tudied regularity of my little &s;hrubbery &s;hould afford him any kind of plea&s;ure? To drop the metaphor, if the following tra|gedy does not appear to you a MONSTROUS FARCE, it is all I can rea&s;onably expect. But whatever may be your opinion of it, I mu&s;t beg that you will not make it the criterion by which you would decide concerning the ta&s;te of the Engli&s;h nation, or the pre&s;ent &s;tate of lite|rature among us. What you have humbly &s;aid of your|&s;elf, in order to do honour to your nation, I can a&s;&s;ert with truth of the author of the Engli&s;h ORPHAN, that he is one of the wor&s;t poets now in this country. It is true, indeed, that the play has been received with uncommon applau&s;e; that &s;o elegant a writer as the author of CREUSA and THE ROMAN FATHER was my critic and my friend; and that a great deal of very par|ticular honour has been done me by many per&s;ons of the
<PB N="96" REF="105">
fir&s;t di&s;tinction. But, give me leave to &s;ay, they all know the faults of the piece, as well as if it had been di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed by the academy of <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI>&mdash;We are a generous nation, &s;ir; and the fainte&s;t approaches to merit, always meet here the warme&s;t encouragement. One thing further I will a&s;&s;ure you, in ca&s;e you &s;hould di&s;cover any traces of barbari&s;m in the &s;tyle or fable, That if you had been pre&s;ent at the repre&s;entation, you would have &s;een a theatrical &s;plendor conducted with a <HI>bien&s;cance</HI> unknown to the <HI>&s;cene Francoi&s;e;</HI> the perform|ance of the two Young Men would have made you re|gret that they were not in your piece; and, though a weak &s;tate of health deprived the play of &s;o fine an ac|tre&s;s as Mrs. CIBBER, you would have beheld in MAN|DANE a figure that would be an ornament to any &s;tage in Europe, and you would have acknowleged that her Acting promi&s;es al&s;o to be the &s;ame: moreover, you would have &s;een a ZAMTI, who&s;e exqui&s;ite powers are capable of adding Pathos and Harmony even to our great SHAKESPEAR, and have already been the chief &s;upport of &s;ome of your &s;cenes upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, &s;ir, I beg you will not imagine that I have wrote this Tragedy in the fond hope of eclip&s;ing &s;o celebrated a writer as you are: I had an humbler motive, <HI>propter amorem quod to imitari aveo.</HI> Could I do that in any di&s;tant degree, it would very amply gratify the ambition of,</P>
