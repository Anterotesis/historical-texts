<P>LIKEWISE, Mr. AVISON's REPLY to the Author of <HI>Remarks on the E&s;&s;ay on</HI> MUSICAL EXPRESSION. In a Letter from Mr. <HI>Avi&s;on,</HI> to his Friend in <HI>London.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS there are &s;everal mu&s;ical terms, which will frequently occur in the cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay, and which are not always &s;ufficiently attended to; it may therefore be nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are not particularly conver&s;ant in Mu&s;ic, to explain them according to their mo&s;t general acceptation.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, the term MELODY may be defined the <HI>means</HI> or method of ranging <HI>&s;ingle</HI> mu&s;ical &s;ounds in a regular progre&s;|&s;ion, either a&s;cending or de&s;cending, ac|cording to the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
HARMONY is the method of ranging two or more <HI>concording</HI> mu&s;ical &s;ounds; or the agreeable <HI>union</HI> of them in &s;everal parts, when &s;ung or played together. As therefore a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;ingle</HI> mu&s;ical &s;ounds produces <HI>melody,</HI> &s;o does a continued <HI>combination</HI> of the&s;e produce <HI>harmony.</HI></P>
<P>MODULATION is the effect of <HI>&s;ingle,</HI> or <HI>concording</HI> mu&s;ical &s;ounds, &s;ucceeding one another in an <HI>arbitrary</HI> but <HI>agreeable</HI> pro|gre&s;&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ing from one <HI>key</HI> to another; and therefore doth as well relate to <HI>com|bined,</HI> as to <HI>&s;ingle</HI> mu&s;ical &s;ounds.</P>
<P>BY the word <HI>Key,</HI> is meant, a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of any eight <HI>natural notes:</HI> the lowe&s;t note, being con&s;idered as the <HI>prin|cipal,</HI> is therefore called the <HI>key-note;</HI> all
<PB N="v" REF="4">
the other notes in that key being &s;ubor|dinate to it.</P>
<P>CADENCES in Mu&s;ic, are the &s;ame as &s;tops in &s;peaking or writing; being, in like manner, the proper terminations, either of a part, or of the whole of a compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE term <HI>Subject</HI> (or <HI>Fugue</HI> or <HI>Air</HI>) is, in a mu&s;ical &s;en&s;e, what the word <HI>Subject</HI> likewi&s;e implies in writing. The term <HI>Air,</HI> in &s;ome ca&s;es, includes the manner of handling or carrying on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>PASSAGES in Mu&s;ic, are al&s;o like <HI>Sentences</HI> or <HI>Paragraphs</HI> in writing. This la&s;t term hath &s;ometimes been u&s;ed to de|note <HI>Graces,</HI> or <HI>extempore Flouri&s;hings</HI> only. But in this latter &s;en&s;e we &s;hall never con|&s;ider it, the former definition being more
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
&s;trictly ju&s;t, according to its original ac|ceptation, and therefore more applicable to the intention of this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>MUSIC is &s;aid to be in <HI>Score,</HI> when all the parts are di&s;tinctly wrote and &s;et under each other, &s;o as the eye, at one view, may take in all the various contrivances of the compo&s;er.</P>

<P>AS the public inclination for Mu&s;ic &s;eems every day advancing, it may not be ami&s;s, at this time, to offer a few ob&s;ervations on that delightful art; &s;uch ob&s;ervations, I mean, as may be chiefly applicable to the pre&s;ent times; &s;uch as may tend to correct any errors that have ari&s;en, either in the compo&s;ition, or the practice of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9">
If we view this art in its foundations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> we &s;hall find, that by the con&s;titution o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> man it is of mighty efficacy in working both on his imagination and his pa&s;&s;ions<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> The force of <HI>harmony,</HI> or <HI>melody</HI> alone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> is wonderful on the imagination. <HI>A ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> chord</HI> &s;truck, or a beautiful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;ingle &s;ounds</HI> produced, is no le&s;s ravi&s;hing to the ear, than ju&s;t &s;ymmetry or exqui&s;ite colours to the eye.</P>
<P>The capacity of receiving plea&s;ure from the&s;e mu&s;ical &s;ounds, is, in fact, a peculiar and internal &s;en&s;e; but of a much more refined nature than the external &s;en&s;es: for in the plea&s;ures ari&s;ing from our internal &s;en&s;e of harmony, there is no prior unea&s;ine&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our ta&s;ting them in their full perfection; neither is the enjoyment of them attend|ed either with languor or di&s;gu&s;t. It is their peculiar and e&s;&s;ential property, to dive&s;t the &s;oul of every unquiet pa&s;&s;ion, to pour in upon the mind a &s;ilent and &s;erene joy, beyond the power of words to expre&s;s, and to fix the heart in a
<PB N="3" REF="10">
rational, benevolent, and happy tran|quillity.</P>
<P>But, though this be the natural effect of <HI>melody</HI> or <HI>harmony</HI> on the imagination, when &s;imply con&s;idered; yet when to the&s;e is added the force of <HI>Mu&s;ical Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,</HI> the effect is greatly increa&s;ed; for then they a&s;&s;ume the power of excit|ing all the mo&s;t agreeable pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul. The force of &s;ound in alarming the pa&s;&s;ions is prodigious. Thus, the noi&s;e of thunder, the &s;houts of war, the uproar of an enraged ocean, &s;trike us with terror: &s;o again, there are certain &s;ounds natural to joy, others to grief or de&s;pondency, others to tenderne&s;s and love; and by hearing <HI>the&s;e,</HI> we naturally &s;ympathize with tho&s;e who either <HI>enjoy</HI> or <HI>&s;uffer.</HI> Thus mu&s;ic, either by imitating the&s;e various &s;ounds in due &s;ubordination to the laws of <HI>air</HI> and <HI>harmony,</HI> or by any other method of a&s;&s;ociation, bring|ing the objects of our pa&s;&s;ions before us (e&s;pecially when tho&s;e objects are deter|mined, and made as it were vi&s;ibly and
<PB N="4" REF="11">
intimately pre&s;ent to the imagination by the help of words) does naturally rai&s;e a variety of pa&s;&s;ions in the human brea&s;t, &s;imilar to the &s;ounds which are expre&s;&s;ed: and thus, by the mu&s;ician's art, we are often carried into the fury of a battle or a tempe&s;t, we are by turns elated with joy, or &s;unk in plea&s;ing &s;orrow, rouzed to courage, or quelled by grateful terrors, melted into pity, tenderne&s;s, and love, or tran&s;ported to the regions of bli&s;s, in an extacy of divine prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But beyond this, I think we may ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that it is the peculiar quality of Mu&s;ic to rai&s;e the <HI>&s;ociable and happy pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and to <HI>&s;ubdue</HI> the <HI>contrary ones.</HI> I know it has been generally believed and affirmed, that its power extends alike to every affection of the mind. But I would offer it to the con&s;ideration of the public, whether this is not a general and fundamental error. I would appeal to any man, whether ever he found him&s;elf urged to acts of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, cruelty, treachery, revenge, or malevolence, by
<PB N="5" REF="12">
the power of mu&s;ical &s;ounds? or if he ever found jealou&s;y, &s;u&s;picion, or ingra|titude engendered in his brea&s;t, either from HARMONY or DISCORD? I believe no in|&s;tance of this nature can be alledged with truth. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that the force of mu&s;ic may urge the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> to an exce&s;s, or it may fix them on fal&s;e and improper objects, and may thus be pernicious in its effects: but &s;till the pa&s;&s;ions which it rai&s;es, though they may be <HI>mi&s;led</HI> or <HI>exce&s;&s;ive,</HI> are of the benevolent and &s;ocial kind, and in their intent at lea&s;t are di&s;intere&s;ted and noble<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Le&s;t the two pa&s;&s;ions above-mentioned, of <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>grief,</HI> &s;hould be thought an exception to this rule, it may not be improper to remark as to the fir&s;t, that the <HI>terror</HI> rai&s;ed by <HI>Mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> is always of that grateful kind, which ari&s;es from an impre&s;&s;ion of &s;omething terrible to the imagination, but which is immediately di&s;&s;ipated, by a &s;ub&s;equent conviction that the danger is entirely imaginary: of the &s;ame kind is the terror rai&s;ed in us, when we &s;tand near the edge of a precipice, or in &s;ight of a tempe&s;tuous ocean, or are pre&s;ent at a tragical repre&s;entation on the &s;tage: in all the&s;e ca&s;es, as in that of mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, the &s;en&s;e of our <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> mixes it&s;elf with the terrible impre&s;&s;ions, and melts them into a very &s;en&s;ible delight. As to the &s;econd in&s;tance, that of grief, it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that as it always has &s;omething of the &s;ocial kind for its foundation, &s;o it is often attended with a kind of &s;en&s;ation, which may with truth be called <HI>plea&s;ing.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">
As I take this to be the truth of the ca&s;e, &s;o it &s;eems to me no difficult matter to a&s;&s;ign a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for it: we have already &s;een that it is the natural effect of air or harmony to throw the mind into a plea&s;urable &s;tate: and when it hath obtained this &s;tate, it will of cour&s;e exert tho&s;e powers, and be &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which are the mo&s;t natural and agreeable to it. Now the&s;e are alto|gether of the benevolent &s;pecies; ina&s;|much as we know that the contrary af|fections, &s;uch as anger, revenge, jea|lou&s;y, and hatred, are always attended with anxiety and pain: whereas all the various modifications of love, whether human or divine, are but &s;o many kinds of immediate happine&s;s. From this view of things therefore it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that every &s;pecies of mu&s;ical &s;ound mu&s;t tend to di&s;pel the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e they are <HI>painful;</HI> and nouri&s;h
<PB N="7" REF="14">
tho&s;e which are benevolent, becau&s;e they are <HI>plea&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t general and &s;triking in&s;tance of the power of Mu&s;ic, perhaps, that we know of, is that related of the <HI>Arcadians</HI> by POLYBIUS, in the fourth book of his hi&s;tory; which, as it expre&s;sly coincides with the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, I &s;hall ven|ture to give the reader entire.</P>
<P>This judicious hi&s;torian, &s;peaking of the cruelties exerci&s;ed upon the <HI>Cynaethians</HI> by the <HI>Aetolians,</HI> and the little compa&s;&s;ion that their neighbours had &s;hewn them; after having de&s;cribed the calamities of this people, abhorred by all <HI>Greece,</HI> adds the following remarks: <Q REND="inline"><P>"As the <HI>Arcadians</HI> are e&s;teemed by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> not only for the gentlene&s;s of their manners, their beneficence and humanity towards &s;trangers, but al&s;o for their piety to the gods; it may not be ami&s;s to examine, in few words, with regard to the ferocity of the <HI>Cynae|thians,</HI> how it is po&s;&s;ible, being incon|te&s;table <HI>Arcadians</HI> from their origin,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
they are become &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their cruelty, and all manner of crimes, from the other <HI>Greeks</HI> of this time. I believe, it can only be imput|ed to their having been the fir&s;t and &s;ole people of all the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> who were e&s;tranged from the laudable in&s;ti|tutions of their ance&s;tors, founded upon the natural wants of all tho&s;e who in|habit <HI>Arcadia.</HI></P>
<P>"The &s;tudy of Mu&s;ic (I mean that which is worthy the name) has its utility every-where; but it is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary among the <HI>Arcadians.</HI> For we mu&s;t not adopt the &s;entiment of <HI>Ephorus,</HI> who, in the beginning of his writings, advances this propo&s;ition un|worthy of him: <HI>that Mu&s;ic is intro|duced among&s;t men, as a kind of in|chantment, only to deceive and mi&s;lead them.</HI> Neither &s;hould we imagine that it is without rea&s;on, that the ancient people of <HI>Crete</HI> and <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> have preferred the u&s;e of &s;oft Mu&s;ic in war, to that of the trumpet; or, that the
<PB N="9" REF="16">
<HI>Arcadians,</HI> in e&s;tabli&s;hing their repub|lic, although in other re&s;pects extreme|ly au&s;tere in their manner of living, have &s;hewn to Mu&s;ic &s;o high a regard, that they not only teach this art to their children, but even compel their youth to a &s;tudy of it to the age of thirty. The&s;e facts are notoriou&s;ly known. It is al&s;o known, that the <HI>Arcadians</HI> are almo&s;t the only people, among whom their youth, in obedience to the laws, habituate them&s;elves from their infancy, to &s;ing <HI>hymns</HI> and <HI>paeans,</HI> as is u&s;ual among them, to the honour of the gods and heroes of their country. They are likewi&s;e taught the airs of <HI>Philoxenus</HI> and <HI>Timotheus;</HI> after which, every year, during the fea&s;ts of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> this youth are divided into two bands, the one con&s;i&s;ting of boys, the other of their young men, who, to the mu&s;ic of flutes, dance in their theatres with great emulation, celebrating tho&s;e games which take their names from each troop. Even in their a&s;&s;emblies and
<PB N="10" REF="17">
parties of plea&s;ure, the <HI>Arcadians</HI> divert them&s;elves le&s;s in conver&s;ation, or re|lating of &s;tories, than in &s;inging by turns, and inviting each other recipro|cally to this exerci&s;e. It is no di&s;grace with them, to own their ignorance of other arts: but they cannot deny their ability in &s;inging, becau&s;e, at all events, they are nece&s;&s;itated to acquire this ta|lent; nor, in confe&s;&s;ing their &s;kill, can they exempt them&s;elves from giving proofs of it, as that would be deemed among&s;t them a particular infamy. Be|&s;ides this, at the care and expence of the public, their youth are trained in dancing and military exerci&s;es, which they perform to the mu&s;ic of flutes; and every year give proof of their abilities in the pre&s;ence of their fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>"Now it &s;eems to me, that the fir&s;t legi&s;lators, in forming &s;uch kind of e&s;tabli&s;hments, have not had any de|&s;ign of introducing luxury and effe|minacy; but that they have chiefly had
<PB N="11" REF="18">
in view the way of living among the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> which their manual and toil&s;ome exerci&s;es rendered extremely laborious and &s;evere; and the au&s;tere manners of this people, to which the coldne&s;s and &s;everity of the air in al|mo&s;t every part of <HI>Arcadia</HI> did greatly contribute.</P>
<P>"For it is natural to partake of the quality of this element. Thence it is, that different people, in proportion to the di&s;tance which &s;eparates them, differ from each other, not only in their exterior form and colour, but al&s;o in their cu&s;toms and employments. The legi&s;lators, therefore, willing to &s;often and temper this ferocity and rugged|ne&s;s of the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> made all tho&s;e regulations which I have here men|tioned; and in&s;tituted, be&s;ides the&s;e, va|rious a&s;&s;emblies and &s;acrifices, as well for the men, as for the women; and al&s;o dances for their children of both &s;exes. In a word, they contrived all kinds of expedients to &s;often and a&s;|&s;wage,
<PB N="12" REF="19">
by this culture of their man+ners, the natural rudene&s;s and barbari+ty of the <HI>Arcadians.</HI></P>
<P>"But the <HI>Cynaethians,</HI> who inhabit the mo&s;t rude and &s;avage parts of <HI>Ar|cadia,</HI> having neglected all tho&s;e helps of which, on that account, they had &s;o much the more occa&s;ion; and being, on the contrary, &s;ubject to mutual di|vi&s;ions and conte&s;ts, they are, at length, become &s;o fierce and barbarous, that there is not a city in <HI>Greece,</HI> where &s;uch frequent and enormous crimes are committed, as in that of <HI>Cynaetha.</HI></P>
<P>"An in&s;tance of the unhappy &s;tate of this people, and of the aver&s;ion of all the <HI>Arcadians</HI> to their form of go|vernment, is the treatment that was &s;hewn to their deputies which they &s;ent to the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> after the horrible ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Cynaetha.</HI> In all the towns of <HI>Arcadia</HI> which the&s;e deputies en|tered, immediate notice was given by an herald, that they &s;hould in&s;tantly de|part. But the inhabitants of <HI>Manti|nea,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="20">
after the departure of the&s;e en|voys, went &s;o far, as to purify them&s;elves by expiatory &s;acrifices, and to carry the victims round the city and its territories, to purify both the one and the other.</P>
<P>"We have related all the&s;e things; fir&s;t, that other cities may be prevent|ed from cen&s;uring in general the cu&s;|toms of the <HI>Arcadians;</HI> or, le&s;t &s;ome of the people of <HI>Arcadia</HI> them&s;elves, upon fal&s;e prejudices, that the &s;tudy of Mu&s;ic is permitted them only as a &s;u|perficial amu&s;ement, &s;hould be pre|vailed upon to neglect this part of their di&s;cipline: in the &s;econd place, to en|gage the <HI>Cynaethians,</HI> if the gods &s;hould permit, to humanize and &s;often their tempers, by an application to the liberal arts, and e&s;pecially to Mu&s;ic. For this is the only means, by which, they can ever be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that ferocity which they have contracted<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>See <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation o&ugrave; l'on fait voir, que les merveilleux eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, attribuez &agrave; la mu&s;ique des Anciens, ne prouvent point qu'elle fut au&s;&s;i parfaite que la n&ocirc;tre.

<P>This learned and &s;en&s;ible writer, ani|madverting on the &s;evere in&s;titutions of the Ancients in regard to manners, having referred to &s;everal authorities among the <HI>Greeks</HI> on this head, particularly to the relation of POLYBIUS above quoted, pro|ceeds thus.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In the <HI>Greek</HI> republics the magi&s;trates were extremely em|barra&s;&s;ed. They would not have the citizens apply them&s;elves to trade, to agriculture, or to the arts; and yet they would not have them idle. They found, therefore, employment for them
<PB N="15" REF="22">
in gymna&s;tic and military exerci&s;es; and none el&s;e were allowed by their in|&s;titution. Hence the <HI>Greeks</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a &s;ociety of wre&s;tlers and boxers. Now the&s;e exerci&s;es having a natural tendency to render people har|dy and fierce, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for tempering them with others that might &s;often their manners. For this pur|po&s;e, Mu&s;ic, which influences the mind by means of corporeal organs, was ex|tremely proper. It is a kind of me|dium between the bodily exerci&s;es that render men fierce and hardy, and &s;pe|culative &s;ciences that render them un|&s;ociable and &s;our. It cannot be &s;aid that Mu&s;ic in&s;pired virtue, for this would be inconceivable: but it pre|vented the effects of a &s;avage in&s;titu|tion, and inabled the &s;oul to have &s;uch a &s;hare in the education, as it could never have had without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of harmony.
<P>"Let us &s;uppo&s;e among our&s;elves a &s;ociety of men, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of

hunting, as to make it their &s;ole em+ployment; the&s;e people would doubt+le&s;s contract a kind of ru&s;ticity and fiercene&s;s. But if they happened to receive a ta&s;te for Mu&s;ic, we &s;hould quickly perceive a &s;en&s;ible difference in their cu&s;toms and manners. In &s;hort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the exerci&s;es u&s;ed by the <HI>Greeks</HI> excited only one kind of pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> fierce|ne&s;s, anger, and cruelty.

<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> As the proper mixture of ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;hade (called by the <HI>Italians Chiar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> O&s;curo</HI>) has a noble effect in painting, and is, indeed, e&s;&s;ential to the compo&s;itio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a good picture; &s;o the judicious mixture
<PB N="21" REF="28">
of concords and di&s;cords is equally e&s;&s;ential to a mu&s;ical compo&s;ition: as &s;hades are nece&s;&s;ary to relieve the eye, which is &s;oon tired and di&s;gu&s;ted with a level glare of light; &s;o di&s;cords are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to relieve the ear, which is other|wi&s;e immediately &s;atiated with a continued and unvaried &s;train of harmony. We may add (for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are in any degree acquainted with the theory of Mu&s;ic) that the <HI>preparations</HI> and <HI>re|&s;olutions</HI> of di&s;cords, re&s;emble the &s;oft gradations from light to &s;hade, or from &s;hade to light, in Painting.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> As in Painting there are three various degrees of di&s;tances e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>fore-ground,</HI> the <HI>intermediate part,</HI> and the <HI>off-&s;kip;</HI> &s;o in Mu&s;ic there are three different parts &s;trictly &s;imilar to the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the ba&s;s (or fore-ground), the tenor (or intermediate), and the treble (or off-&s;kip). In con&s;equence of this, a mu&s;ical compo&s;ition without its ba&s;s, is like a land&s;cape without its fore|ground; without its tenor, it re&s;embles
<PB N="22" REF="29">
a land&s;cape deprived of its intermediate part; without its treble, it is analagous to a land&s;cape deprived of its di&s;tance, or off-&s;kip. We know how imperfect a picture is, when deprived of any of the&s;e parts; and hence we may form a judge|ment of tho&s;e who determine on the ex|cellence of any mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, with|out &s;eeing or hearing it in all its parts, and under&s;tanding their relation to each other.</P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> As in Painting, e&s;pecially in the nobler branches of it, and particularly in hi&s;tory-painting, there is a principal figure, which is mo&s;t remarkable and con&s;pi|cuous, and to which all the other figures are referred and &s;ubordinate; &s;o, in the greater kinds of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, there is a principal or leading <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of notes, which ought to pre|vail, and be heard through the whole compo&s;ition; and to which, both the air and harmony of the other parts ought to be in like manner referred and &s;ub|ordinate.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30">
6<HI>thly,</HI> So again, as in painting a groupe of figures, care is to be had, that there be no deficiency in it; but that a certain fulne&s;s or roundne&s;s be pre&s;erved, &s;uch as <HI>Titian</HI> beautifully compared to a bunch of grapes; &s;o, in the nobler kinds of mu&s;i|cal compo&s;ition, there are &s;everal inferior &s;ubjects, which depend on the principal: and here the &s;everal &s;ubjects (as in paint|ing the figures do) are, as it were, to <HI>&s;u&s;tain</HI> and <HI>&s;upport</HI> each other: and it is certain, that if any one of the&s;e be taken away from a &s;killful compo&s;ition, there will be found a deficiency highly di&s;a|greeable to an experienced ear. Yet this does not hinder but there may be perfect compo&s;ition in two, three, four, or more parts, in the &s;ame manner as a groupe may be perfect, though con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;maller or greater number of figures. In both ca&s;es, the painter or mu&s;ician varies his di&s;po&s;ition according to the number of parts, or figures, which he includes in his plan.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="31">
7<HI>thly,</HI> As in viewing a picture, you ought to be removed to a certain di&s;tance, called the point of &s;ight, at which all its parts are &s;een in their ju&s;t proportions; &s;o, in a concert, there is a certain di&s;|tance, at which the &s;ounds are melted in|to each other, and the various parts &s;trike the ear in their proper &s;trength and &s;ym|metry. To &s;tand clo&s;e by a ba&s;&s;oon, or double-ba&s;s, when you hear a concert, is ju&s;t as if you &s;hould plant your eye clo&s;e to the fore-ground when you view a picture; or as if, in &s;urveying a &s;pacious edifice, you &s;hould place your&s;elf at the foot of a pillar that &s;upports it.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The various <HI>&s;tyles</HI> in Painting&mdash;the grand&mdash;the terrible&mdash;the graceful&mdash;the tender&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ionate&mdash;the joyous&mdash;have all their re&s;pective analogies in Mu|&s;ic.&mdash;And we may add, in con&s;equence of this, that as the manner of handling differs in Painting, according as the &s;ub|ject varies; &s;o, in Mu&s;ic, there are various in&s;truments &s;uited to the different kinds of mu&s;ical compo&s;itions, and particularly
<PB N="25" REF="32">
adapted to, and expre&s;&s;ive of, its &s;everal varieties. Thus, as the rough handling is proper for battles, &s;ieges, and whatever is great or terrible; and, on the contrary, the &s;ofter handling, and more fini&s;hed touches, are expre&s;&s;ive of love, tender|ne&s;s, or beauty: &s;o, in Mu&s;ic, the trum|pet, horn, or kettle-drum, are mo&s;t pro|perly employed on the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ub|jects, the lute or harp on the la&s;t. There is a &s;hort &s;tory in the TATLER<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">N^o 153.</NOTE>, which illu&s;trates this analogy very prettily. Se|veral eminent painters are there repre&s;ent|ed in picture as mu&s;icians, with tho&s;e in&s;truments in their hands which mo&s;t aptly repre&s;ent their re&s;pective manner in Painting.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. On MUSICAL COMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. ON THE TOO CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO AIR, AND NEGLECT OF HARMONY.</HEAD>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations being premi|&s;ed, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are not particularly conver&s;ant in the theory of Mu&s;ic; let us now proceed to con&s;ider this art with regard to its compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that there are, properly &s;peaking, but three circum|&s;tances, on which the worth of any mu|&s;ical compo&s;ition can depend. The&s;e are <HI>melody, harmony,</HI> and <HI>expre&s;&s;ion.</HI> When the&s;e three are united in their full excel|lence, the compo&s;ition is then perfect: if any of the&s;e are wanting or imperfect, the compo&s;ition is proportionably defective. The chief endeavour, therefore, of the &s;killful compo&s;er, mu&s;t be <Q REND="inline">"to unite all the&s;e various &s;ources of beauty in every
<PB N="27" REF="34">
piece; and never &s;o far regard or idolize any one of them, as to de&s;pi&s;e and omit the other two."</Q></P>
<P>Several examples will hereafter be gi|ven of con&s;iderable ma&s;ters, who, through an exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for one of the&s;e, have &s;acrificed the re&s;t, and have thus fal|len &s;hort of that perfection and variety, which a correct ear demands.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t error we &s;hall note is, where the harmony, and con&s;equently the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, is neglected for the &s;ake of air, or rather an extravagant modulation.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable extreme of running all our mu&s;ic into one &s;ingle part, to the utter neglect of all true harmony, is a defect much more e&s;&s;ential than the neglect of modulation only; ina&s;much as harmony is the very cement of all mu&s;i|cal compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>As in the work of harmony chiefly, the various contrivances of a good compo|&s;ition are laid out and di&s;tingui&s;hed, which, with a full and perfect execution in all the parts, produce tho&s;e noble effects we
<PB N="28" REF="35">
often find in grand performances: &s;o we may con&s;ider the improvement of <HI>air,</HI> as the bu&s;ine&s;s of invention and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But, if we may judge from the gene|ral turn of our modern Mu&s;ic (I &s;peak not of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> only), this due regard, as well to a natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of melodies, as to their harmonious accompanyments, &s;eems generally neglected or forgotten. Hence that deluge of unbounded <HI>extra|vaganzi,</HI> which the un&s;killful call inven|tion, and which are merely calculated to &s;hew an execution, without either pro|priety or grace.</P>
<P>In the&s;e vague and unmeaning pieces, we often find the bewildered compo&s;er, either &s;truggling with the difficulties of an extraneous modulation, or tiring the mo&s;t con&s;ummate patience with a tedious repetition of &s;ome jejune thought, ima|gining he can never do enough, till he has run through every <HI>key</HI> that can be crowd|ed into one <HI>movement;</HI> till, at length, all his force being exhau&s;ted, he drops into a dull <HI>clo&s;e;</HI> where his languid piece &s;eems
<PB N="29" REF="36">
rather to expire and yield its la&s;t, than conclude with a &s;pirited and well-timed <HI>cadence.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e kinds of compo&s;itions are greatly defective al&s;o in point of harmony, and chiefly in the ba&s;s, which is often im|pertinently airy, or, at be&s;t, incapable of giving either &s;pirit or fullne&s;s to the treble; in both ca&s;es the compo&s;er not allotting to the ba&s;s, the only part which it ought to bear in the whole con&s;truction, <HI>viz.</HI> the foundation of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, in this light, may not unaptly be compared to the elevation of a building, where it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern what are the proportions and ornaments &s;uitable to each degree, or a&s;cent, in the elevation: and where the mo&s;t common ob&s;erver would laugh at &s;eeing their order inverted, and the heavy and plain <HI>Tu&s;can,</HI> cru&s;hing down the light and delicate <HI>Ionic.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they &s;trive, rather to &s;urprize, than plea&s;e the hearer: and, as it is ea&s;ier to di&s;cern what is excellent in the <HI>per|formance,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="37">
than <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> of Mu&s;ic; &s;o we may account, why many have been more indu&s;trious to improve and di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves in the <HI>practice,</HI> than the <HI>&s;tudy</HI> of this &s;cience.</P>
<P>To this &s;illy vanity we may attribute that &s;trange attachment to certain un|meaning compo&s;itions, which many of our fluent performers have profe&s;&s;ed; their chief ambition being to di&s;cover a <HI>&s;wift,</HI> rather than a <HI>judicious</HI> or <HI>graceful</HI> hand. That performers of this ta&s;te have &s;o much in their power, is, at once, the misfortune and di&s;grace of Mu&s;ic: for, whatever merit a compo&s;ition may have in other re&s;pects, yet if, from a due re|gard to the con&s;truction of the harmony and fugues, all the parts be put upon a level, and, by that means, their &s;upreme pride and plea&s;ure of a <HI>tedious &s;olo</HI> be not admitted, it is with them a &s;ufficient rea|&s;on of condemning the whole.</P>
<P>The generality of our mu&s;ical virtuo&s;i are too ea&s;ily led by the opinions of &s;uch ma&s;ters; and, where there is no real di&s;|cernment,
<PB N="31" REF="38">
prejudice and affectation will &s;oon a&s;&s;ume the place of rea&s;on. Thus, through the inordinate vanity of a few leading performers, a di&s;proportionate fame hath been the lot of &s;ome very in|different compo&s;ers, while others, with real merit, have been almo&s;t totally un|known.</P>
<P>It may be worth con&s;idering, from whence this fal&s;e ta&s;te hath had its ri&s;e. And 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> it may, perhaps, be affirmed with truth, that the fal&s;e ta&s;te, or rather the total want of ta&s;te, in tho&s;e who hear, and who always a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves the privilege of <HI>judging,</HI> hath often produced this low &s;pecies of Mu&s;ic: for it mu&s;t be owned, that this kind of com|po&s;ition is apt, above all others, at fir&s;t hearing, to &s;trike an un&s;killful ear; and hence the ma&s;ters have often &s;acrificed their art to the gro&s;s judgement of an indelicate audience.</P>
<P>But 2<HI>dly,</HI> It hath often had its ri&s;e from the compo&s;er's be&s;towing his la|bour and attention on &s;ome trifling and
<PB N="32" REF="39">
unfruitful &s;ubject, which can never allow of an ea&s;y and natural harmony to &s;up|port it. For, however plea&s;ing it may &s;eem in its air, yet if it is not capable of admitting al&s;o a plea&s;ing accompanyment, it were much better laid a&s;ide, than car|ried into execution. On this account it is, that many fugues are un&s;ufferably te|dious: their barren &s;ubjects affording no variety in them&s;elves, are therefore often repeated entire; or tran&s;po&s;ed, or turned top&s;ey-turvey, in&s;omuch that little el&s;e is heard throughout the whole piece<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>I know it is a received opinion among the <HI>con|noi&s;&s;eurs</HI> in Mu&s;ic, that the be&s;t <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> for <HI>fugues,</HI> or <HI>airs,</HI> are pretty much exhau&s;ted; and, perhaps, their ob&s;ervation may be right: neverthele&s;s, the &s;killful compo&s;er will &s;o artfully vary and conduct them, that they will &s;eem not only natural, but al&s;o new.</P>
<P>This may be &s;een by certain particular favourite pa&s;&s;ages, that are to be found in almo&s;t all the com|po&s;itions of our greate&s;t ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean here, tho&s;e &s;lavi&s;h imitations of whole movements together, e&s;|pecially of many of CORELLI's, which &s;hew their compo&s;ers &s;o de&s;titute of all invention, or contrivance, as not to &s;trike out one thought or device, that can ju&s;tly be called original.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="40">
3<HI>dly,</HI> Another &s;ource, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t general, is that low idea of compo&s;ition, wherein the &s;ubject, or air, is no &s;ooner led off, than it is immediately de&s;erted, for the &s;ake of &s;ome &s;trange un|expected flights, which have neither con|nection with each other, nor the lea&s;t tendency to any de&s;ign whatever.

<P>How different from the conduct of the&s;e &s;uperficial adventurers in Mu&s;ic, is that of the able and experienced com|po&s;er; who, when he hath exerted his fancy on any favourite &s;ubject, will re|&s;erve his &s;ketch, till at his lei&s;ure, and when his judgement is free, he can again and again correct, dimini&s;h, or enlarge his plan; &s;o that the whole may appear,

<HEAD>SECT. II. ON THE TOO CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO HARMONY, AND NEGLECT OF AIR.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING noted the reigning defect of the modern compo&s;ers, ari&s;ing from their &s;uperficial u&s;e of modulation, to the utter neglect of all true harmony the next thing that offers it&s;elf, is the very rever&s;e of this. I mean, the too &s;evere attachment of the Ancients<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">By the Ancients are meant, tho&s;e who lived from the time of PALESTINA to the introduction of modern operas.</NOTE> to harmony, and the neglect of modula|tion. The old ma&s;ters, in general, di&s;|cover a great depth of knowledge in the con&s;truction of their harmony. Their &s;ubjects are invented, and carried on with wonderful art; to which they often add a con&s;iderable energy and force of ex|pre&s;&s;ion: yet, we mu&s;t own, that with regard to <HI>air</HI> or modulation, they are often defective. Our old cathedral mu|&s;ic
<PB N="39" REF="46">
is a &s;ufficient proof of this: here we generally find the more &s;triking beauties of air or modulation, give way to a dry rule of counterpoint: many an elaborate piece, by this means, in&s;tead of being &s;o|lemn, becomes formal; and while our thoughts, by a <HI>natural</HI> and plea&s;ing me|lody, &s;hould be elevated to the proper objects of our devotion, we are only &s;truck with an idea of &s;ome <HI>artificial</HI> contri|vances in the harmony.</P>
<P>Thus the old Mu&s;ic was often con|trived to di&s;cover the compo&s;er's <HI>art,</HI> as the modern is generally calculated to di&s;|play the performer's <HI>dexterity.</HI></P>
<P>The learned <HI>contrapunti&s;t</HI> may exerci&s;e his talent in many wonderful contri|vances, as in <HI>fugues</HI> and <HI>canons</HI> of various <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> and <HI>parts,</HI> &amp;c. But, where the ma&s;ter is thus &s;everely intent in &s;hewing his art, he may, indeed, amu&s;e the <HI>un|der&s;tanding,</HI> and amaze the <HI>eye,</HI> but can never touch the <HI>heart,</HI> or delight the <HI>ear.</HI></P>
<P>I have often thought that the &s;tate of Mu&s;ic, at different times, might, very
<PB N="40" REF="47">
appo&s;itely, be compared to the &s;eries of alterations in the art of building. We cannot, indeed, with the &s;ame certainty and preci&s;ion, determine what may have been the perfection of Mu&s;ic, in its ori|ginal &s;tate, among the Ancients: yet, the &s;hort analogy which follows, may &s;erve to evince, that both the&s;e arts have varied according to the ta&s;te of particular ages.</P>
<P>It is well known, that in old <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> architecture was in its highe&s;t perfection; and that, after their &s;everal empires were overthrown, the&s;e glorious monuments of their ta&s;te and genius were almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded a &s;trange mixture of the <HI>antique</HI> and <HI>barbarous</HI> Gu&s;to, which has &s;ince been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Gothic. In the&s;e latter ages this art has gradually returned to its former &s;tate; and the an|cient reli&s;h of the grand, the &s;imple, and convenient is revived.</P>
<P>And thus we may di&s;tingui&s;h the three great <HI>aeras</HI> of Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48">
Among&s;t the Ancients, the true &s;im|plicity of <HI>melody,</HI> with, perhaps, &s;ome mixture of plain unperplexed <HI>harmony,</HI> &s;eems to have been that <HI>magic &s;pell,</HI> which &s;o powerfully inchanted every hearer.</P>
<P>At the revival of this art in the time of Pope GREGORY, a new &s;y&s;tem, and new laws of harmony were invented, and afterwards enlarged by GUIDO ARE|TINO: but this &s;erved only to lead the plodding geniu&s;es of tho&s;e times (and &s;ince, their rigid followers) to incumber the art with a <HI>confu&s;ion of parts,</HI> which, like the numerous and trifling ornaments in the <HI>Gothic architecture,</HI> was productive of no other plea&s;ure, than that of wonder|ing at the patience and minutene&s;s of the arti&s;t, and which, like <HI>that</HI> too, by men of ta&s;te, hath long been exploded<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> I, the mu&s;icians were famous for compo&s;ing le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in forty parts.

<P>At pre&s;ent our ta&s;te is greatly more diver&s;ified, more &s;ubjected to the genius
<PB N="42" REF="49">
and language of particular countries, and le&s;s confined by tho&s;e rigorous laws; the lea&s;t deviation from which, was formerly thought an unpardonable offence; as if tho&s;e laws were intended to fix the boun|daries of genius, and prevent the ad|vancement of &s;cience.</P>
<P>But, as we have &s;aid, the art (though &s;till fluctuating) has now gained much freedom and enlargement, from the&s;e minute and &s;evere laws, and is returning nearer to its ancient &s;implicity. The mo&s;t eminent compo&s;ers of late years, have not &s;hewn any great fondne&s;s for a multiplicity of parts, which rather de|&s;troy than a&s;&s;i&s;t the force and efficacy of Mu&s;ic: neither have they deprived the charms of <HI>melody</HI> of their peculiar pro|vince, by &s;tunning the ear with an <HI>har|mony</HI> too intricate and multifarious. And, I believe, upon a general &s;urvey of the particular genius of different ma&s;ters, we &s;hall find, that tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t of <HI>nature</HI> in their compo&s;itions, have generally endeavoured to &s;upply the
<PB N="43" REF="50">
want of it, by the &s;everer application of <HI>art.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, I would by no means be thought to include all the old ma&s;ters in this cen&s;ure: &s;ome of them have carried mu|&s;ical compo&s;ition to that height of excel|lence, that we need think it no di&s;grace to form our ta&s;te of <HI>counterpoint</HI> on the valuable plans they have left us. Num|bers of the&s;e indeed have fallen, and de|&s;ervedly, into oblivion; &s;uch, I mean, who had only the cold a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, and were de&s;titute of genius. But there are others of this cla&s;s, who, although the early period in which they wrote, naturally expo&s;ed them to the defect here noted; yet the force of their genius, and the wonderful con&s;truction of their fugues and harmony, hath excited the admira|tion of all &s;ucceeding ages. And here we &s;hall find, that the compo&s;ers of this cla&s;s will naturally fall into three different ranks, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e we have already ventured to characterize in the preceding &s;ection.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="51">
Among the&s;e, PALESTINA, the fir&s;t, not only in point of time<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">PALESTINA lived at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the time of LEO the Tenth; the period at which all arts revived.</NOTE>, but of ge|nius too, de&s;erves the high title of <HI>father of harmony.</HI> And the &s;tyle of our great old ma&s;ter TALLIS<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">TALLIS was chapel-ma&s;ter in <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's time.</NOTE>, evidently &s;hews he had &s;tudied the works of this great com|po&s;er, who lived to &s;ee his own &s;y&s;tem of harmony take root, and flouri&s;h in many parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> but more e&s;pecially in <HI>Italy,</HI> where he was immediately &s;ucceed|ed by &s;everal eminent ma&s;ters, among whom, perhaps, ALLEGRI may be e&s;teem|ed the chief; who&s;e compo&s;itions, with tho&s;e of PALESTINA, are &s;till performed in the Pope's chapel, and other choirs abroad: in all the&s;e ma&s;ters we &s;ee the &s;ame grand con&s;truction of parts, and a parallel <HI>defect</HI> of <HI>modulation.</HI></P>
<P>After the&s;e we may rank CARISSIMI, STRADELLA<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>STRADELLA is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of the fir&s;t compo&s;ers who introduced the recitative into vocal compo&s;itions.

I mean, that although their character is that of <HI>excellence in harmony</HI> and <HI>defect in air;</HI> yet they are not &s;o excellent in the former, nor &s;o defective in the latter, as the vene|rable PALESTINA.</P>

Here the great compo&s;er has very judiciou&s;ly em|ployed the vocal part in the nobler office of expre&s;|&s;ing, with pathos, the plaintive turn of the words, while the &s;ymphony and accompanyment very chearfully imitate the &s;inging of <HI>the warbling quire.</HI> But had Mr. HANDEL admitted this <HI>imitation of ound</HI> into the vocal part, and made it imitate the <HI>thrilling &s;trains of the birds</HI> by <HI>warbling divi&s;ions,</HI> it is manife&s;t the expre&s;&s;ion would have been much in|jured; whereas, according to his management of it, the <HI>imitation</HI> greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts the expre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>. Indeed, in &s;ome ca&s;es, expre&s;&s;ion will coincide with imita|tion, and may then be admitted univer|&s;ally: as in &s;uch <HI>chromatic &s;trains</HI> as are mimetic of the grief and angui&s;h of the human voice<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">As, to take Mr <HI>H's</HI> own example, the chorus of Baal's Prie&s;ts in Deborah. <HI>Doleful tidings, how ye wound!</HI></NOTE>.

<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> When Mu&s;ic imitates <HI>motions,</HI> the rythm, and ca&s;t of the air, will generally require, that both the vocal and in&s;tru|mental parts coincide in their imitation.

<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> As Mu&s;ic can only imitate mo|tions and &s;ounds, and the <HI>motions</HI> only imperfectly; it will follow, that mu&s;ical imitation ought never to be employed in repre&s;enting objects, of which motion or &s;ound are not the principal con&s;tituents. Thus, to light, or lightning, we annex the property of celerity of motion; yet it will not follow from thence, that an ex|tremely &s;wift progre&s;&s;ion of notes will rai&s;e the idea of either one or the other; be|cau&s;e, as we &s;aid, the imitation mu&s;t be, in the&s;e ca&s;es, very partial<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">What &s;hall we &s;ay to excu&s;e this &s;ame great com|po&s;er, who, in his Oratorio of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> conde&s;cended to amu&s;e the vulgar part of his audience, by letting them <HI>hear the &s;un &s;tand &s;till?</HI></NOTE>.

<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> As the aim of Mu&s;ic is to af|fect the pa&s;&s;ions in a plea&s;ing manner, and as it u&s;es melody and harmony to obtain that end, its imitation mu&s;t never be employed on <HI>ungraceful motions,</HI> or <HI>di&s;|agreeable &s;ounds:</HI> becau&s;e, in the one ca&s;e, it mu&s;t injure the <HI>melody</HI> of the air; and in the other, the <HI>harmony</HI> of the accom|panyment; and, in both ca&s;es, mu&s;t lo&s;e its intent of affecting the pa&s;&s;ions <HI>plea|&s;ingly.</HI></P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> As imitation is only &s;o far of u&s;e in Mu&s;ic, as when it aids the expre&s;&s;ion; as it is only analogous to poetic imitation, <HI>when poetry imitates</HI> through mere natural media<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>H's</HI> Treati&s;es, p. 70.</NOTE>, &s;o it &s;hould only be employed in the &s;ame manner. To make the &s;ound echo to the &s;en&s;e in de&s;criptive lyric, and, perhaps, in the cooler parts of epic poe|try, is often a great beauty; but, &s;hould the tragic poet labour at &s;hewing this art
<PB N="60" REF="67">
in his mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;peeches; I &s;uppo&s;e he would rather flatten than in&s;pirit his drama: in like manner, the mu&s;ical compo&s;er, who catches at every parti|cular <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">To give but one in&s;tance, how many compo&s;ers hath the &s;ingle epithet, WARELING, mi&s;led from the true road of expre&s;&s;ion, like an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> and be|mired them in a <HI>pun?</HI></NOTE>epithet or metaphor that the part affords him, to &s;hew his imitative power, will never fail to hurt the true aim of his compo&s;ition, and will always prove the more deficient in proportion as his au|thor is more pathetic or &s;ublime.</P>
<P>What then is the compo&s;er, who would aim at true mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, to per|form? I an&s;wer, he is to blend &s;uch an happy mixture of air and harmony, as will affect us mo&s;t &s;trongly with the pa&s;&s;ions or affections which the poet intends to rai&s;e: and that, on this account, he is not principally to dwell on particular words in the way of imitation, but to compre|hend the poet's general drift or intention, and on this to form his airs and harmony,
<PB N="61" REF="68">
either by imitation (&s;o far as imitation may be proper to this end) or by any other means. But this I mu&s;t &s;till add, that if he attempts to rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions by imitation, it mu&s;t be &s;uch a temperate and cha&s;ti&s;ed imitation as rather brings the object before the hearer, than &s;uch a one as induces him to form a com|pari&s;on between the object and the &s;ound: for, in this la&s;t ca&s;e, his attention will be turned entirely on the compo&s;er's art, which mu&s;t effectually check the pa&s;&s;ion. The power of Mu&s;ic is, in this re&s;pect, parallel to the power of Eloquence: if it works at all, it mu&s;t work in a &s;ecret and un&s;u&s;pected manner. In either ca&s;e, a pompous di&s;play of art will de&s;troy its own intentions: on which account, one of the be&s;t general rules, perhaps, that can be given for mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, is that which gives ri&s;e to the pathetic in every other art, <HI>an unaffected &s;train of nature and &s;implicity</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Whatever the &s;tate of mu&s;ic may have been among the ancient <HI>Greeks,</HI> &amp;c. or whether it was actually capable of producing tho&s;e wonderful effects related of it, we cannot ab&s;olutely determine; &s;eeing all the u&s;es of their <HI>enharmonic &s;cale</HI> are totally lo&s;t; and of their mu&s;ical characters, which &s;hould have conveyed to us their art, &s;lender traces any where to be found.

Thus, the too great compa&s;s of our modern in&s;truments, tempting as well the compo&s;er as performer, to exceed the natural bounds of harmony, may be one rea&s;on why &s;ome authors have &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the ancient Mu&s;ic, and run down that of the modern<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE's Works, 1&s;t vol. fol. p. 162.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I believe we may ju&s;tly conclude, that the force and beauties of the ancient Mu&s;ic did not con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in artful compo&s;itions, or in any &s;uperiority of execution in the performance: as in the pure &s;implicity of its melody; which being performed in uni&s;ons, by their va&s;t choru&s;es of voices and in|&s;truments, no wonder the mo&s;t prodigious effects were produced<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">BONET, Hi&s;toire de la Mu&s;ique.</NOTE>. Since the time of GUIDO ARE|TINO<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">ARETINO lived in the eleventh century.</NOTE>, the laws and principles of harmony have been con&s;iderably enlarged, and, by rendering this art more intricate and complex, have deprived it of tho&s;e plain, though &s;triking beauties, which, pro|bably, almo&s;t every hearer could di&s;tingui&s;h and ad|mire. And I don't know whether this will not go &s;ome way, towards determining the di&s;pute concern|ing the &s;uperior excellency of ancient and modern Mu&s;ic. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the Ancients, when they &s;peak of its marvellous effects, generally con|&s;ider it as an adjunct to poetry. Now an art, in its progre&s;s to its own ab&s;olute perfection, may ar|rive at &s;ome intermediate point; which is its point of perfection, con&s;idered as an art joined to another art; but not to its own, when taken &s;eparately. If the Ancients, therefore, carried melody to its highe&s;t perfection, it is probable they pu&s;hed the mu&s;ical art as far as it would go, con&s;idered as an adjunct to poetry: but harmony is the perfection of Mu&s;ic, as a &s;ingle &s;cience. Hence then we may determine the &s;pecific difference between the ancient and mo|dern compo&s;itions, and con&s;equently their excellency.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Thus, it fares with Mu&s;ic, as it fares with her &s;i&s;ter Poetry; for it mu&s;t be owned, that the compo&s;itions la&s;t men|tioned, are generally upon a level with the words they are &s;et to: their fate too is generally the &s;ame; the&s;e <HI>in&s;ect</HI> pro|ductions &s;eldom out-living the <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> that gives them birth.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="80">
particularly that egregious ab&s;ur|dity of repeating, and fini&s;hing many &s;ongs with the fir&s;t part; when it often happens, after the pa&s;&s;ions of anger and revenge have been &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed, that re|concilement and love are the &s;ubjects of the &s;econd, and, therefore, &s;hould conclude the performance.

<P>I have ju&s;t hinted this unaccountable conduct of the <HI>Italian</HI> compo&s;ers, by way of contra&s;t to a conduct as remark|ably ridiculous in our own; I mean, our manner of &s;etting one &s;ingle trifling air, repeated to many ver&s;es, and all of them, perhaps, expre&s;&s;ive of very different &s;en|timents or affections; than which, a greater ab&s;urdity cannot po&s;&s;ibly be ima|gined, in the con&s;truction of any mu&s;ical compo&s;ition what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="81">
What may farther be ob&s;erved in the compo&s;ition of the&s;e little airs, is the ge|neral method of repeating the &s;ame thought in the <HI>Ritornello,</HI> which is heard in the &s;ong. By this means, the burthen of the tune, be it ever &s;o common, mu&s;t ince&s;&s;antly jingle in the ear, and produce nothing but &s;ome wretched alternations between the in&s;trument and voice.</P>
<P>On the contrary, if the &s;ubject of the &s;ong was relieved by different pa&s;&s;ages in the in&s;trumental part, but of a &s;imilar air with the vocal; this kind of variety might &s;upport the repetition of the whole, with &s;omewhat more &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Among the many excellent ballads which our language affords, I &s;hall men|tion that of <HI>Black-ey'd Su&s;an,</HI> wrote by Mr GAY; and propo&s;e it as a &s;pecimen, to &s;hew by what methods a compo&s;er might handle this genus of the lyric poem: and which, indeed, is no other than to treat them, as the <HI>Italians</HI> have ge|nerally managed tho&s;e little love-&s;tories which are the &s;ubject of their <HI>&s;erenatas:</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="82">
&mdash;a kind of mu&s;ical production, ex|tremely elegant, and proper for this pur|po&s;e. Therefore, I would recommend to our vocal compo&s;ers, &s;ome &s;uch method of &s;etting to mu&s;ic the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ongs, and which, in like manner, will admit of various <HI>airs</HI> and <HI>duetts,</HI> with their <HI>reci|tative,</HI> or mu&s;ical narratives, properly in|ter&s;per&s;ed, to relieve and embelli&s;h the whole.</P>
<P>Thus one good ballad may &s;upply a fruitful genius with a variety of inci|dents, wherein he will have &s;ufficient &s;cope to di&s;play his imagination, and to &s;hew a judgement and contrivance in adapting his &s;everal airs to the different &s;ubjects of the poetry. By this means, not only a genteel and con&s;i&s;tent per|formance might be produced, but al&s;o fewer good ma&s;ters would lavi&s;h their mu&s;ical thoughts on &s;ubjects &s;o far be|neath them: nor, on this account, would there be any dearth of tho&s;e agreeable and familiar airs, which might properly be calculated for tho&s;e entertainments, where
<PB N="76" REF="83">
the public ear &s;hould be always con&s;ulted; and of which I have &s;o good an opinion, that, were this difference between a ju&s;t or fal&s;e ta&s;te but fairly &s;ubmitted to its deci&s;ion, I &s;hould not di&s;pute, but the compo&s;ition which was mo&s;t natural and plea&s;ing, would bid faire&s;t for the general approbation.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;o long as our compo&s;ers pro&s;e|cute their &s;tudies without the lea&s;t know|ledge of any works but &s;uch as are on a level with their own, they mu&s;t never ex|pect to advance in the e&s;teem of their judges. For, as the &s;triking beauties in a fine compo&s;ition, elevate and enliven the fancy; &s;o is it depre&s;&s;ed and vitiated by too great a familiarity with whatever is mean and trifling.</P>
<P>He, therefore, that is ble&s;&s;ed with hap|py talents for this art, let him &s;hun all the means of catching the common air, which &s;o &s;trangely infects and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es too many compo&s;ers; but, unle&s;s he has the virtue of the <HI>bee,</HI> who,
<Q><PB N="77" REF="84">

<L>"From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew;"</L></Q>
I fear, he mu&s;t bani&s;h him&s;elf from almo&s;t every place of public re&s;ort, and fly, per|haps, to mona&s;teries and cells, where the genuine charms of harmony may often, indeed, be found, for &s;tores to grace his future productions.</P>
<P>Our church mu&s;ic is equally capable of improvements from the &s;ame &s;ources of ta&s;te and knowledge. We &s;eem, at pre&s;ent, almo&s;t to have forgot, that devo|tion is the original and proper end of it. Hence that ill-timed levity of air in our modern anthems, that fooli&s;h pride of execution in our voluntaries, which di&s;|gu&s;ts every rational hearer, and di&s;&s;ipates, in&s;tead of heightening, true devotion.</P>
<P>If our organi&s;t is a lover of poetry, without which, we may di&s;pute his love for Mu&s;ic; or indeed, if he has any well|directed pa&s;&s;ions at all; he cannot but feel &s;ome elevation of mind, when he hears the p&s;alm preceding his voluntary, pro|nounced

Yet, if he feels not this divine energy in his own brea&s;t, it will prove but a fruitle&s;s attempt to rai&s;e it in that of others: nor can he hope to throw out tho&s;e happy in&s;tantaneous thoughts, which &s;ometimes far exceed the be&s;t-concerted compo&s;itions, and which the enraptured performer would often gladly &s;ecure to his future u&s;e and plea&s;ure, did they not as fleetly e&s;cape as they ari&s;e.

<P>It may not derogate from our &s;ubject of church-mu&s;ic, ju&s;t to mention the pre|&s;ent method of &s;inging the common p&s;alm tunes in the parochial &s;ervice, which are every where &s;ung without the lea&s;t regard to <HI>time</HI> or <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> by

Whoever has heard the Prote&s;tant congregations abroad &s;ing, in parts, their p&s;alms or hymns, may recollect, with &s;ome plea&s;ure, that part of their religious wor&s;hip; and their exceeding us &s;o far in a performance of this kind, is chiefly owing to the exact <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> in which tho&s;e tunes are &s;ung, and not to their <HI>harmony:</HI> for the greate&s;t part of our own, which were compo&s;ed &s;oon after the Re|formation, by tho&s;e excellent ma&s;ters we had at that time, would doubtle&s;s be found, as well in regard to their &s;olemn <HI>air,</HI> as <HI>harmony,</HI> equal, if not &s;uperior, to any compo&s;itions of their kind. And we may further ob&s;erve, that <HI>air</HI> is, in a higher degree, productive of both &s;o|lemnity and chearfulne&s;s, than <HI>harmony:</HI> for there is a dignity and grace in the
<PB N="81" REF="88">
former, when invented by genius, which a ma&s;terly harmony may indeed a&s;&s;i&s;t, but can never produce.</P>
<P>However trifling it may appear to con&s;ider this &s;pecies of Mu&s;ic, I cannot but own, that I have been uncommonly affected with hearing &s;ome thou&s;ands of voices hymning the Deity in a &s;tyle of harmony adapted to that awful occa&s;ion. But &s;orry I am to ob&s;erve, that the chief performer, in this kind of noble chorus, is too often &s;o fond of his own conceits; that, with his ab&s;urd graces, and tedious and ill-connected interludes, he mi&s;leads or confounds his congregation, in&s;tead of being the rational guide and director of the whole.</P>
<P>It may be thought, perhaps, by thus depriving our organi&s;t of this public op|portunity of &s;hewing his dexterity, both in his voluntary and p&s;alm tune, that all performers indi&s;criminately might be ca|pable of doing the duty here required: but it will be found no &s;uch ea&s;y matter to &s;trike out the true &s;ublimity of &s;tyle,

To this illu&s;trious example in <HI>vocal,</HI> I &s;hall add another, the greate&s;t in <HI>in&s;tru|mental Mu&s;ic;</HI> I mean the admirable GE|MINIANI; who&s;e elegance and &s;pirit of compo&s;ition ought to have been much more our pattern; and from whom the public ta&s;te might have received the highe&s;t improvement, had we thought proper to lay hold of tho&s;e opportunities which his long re&s;idence in this kingdom has given us.</P>
<P>The public is greatly indebted to this gentleman, not only for his many excel|lent compo&s;itions, but for having as yet parted with none that are not extremely correct and fine. There is &s;uch a gen|teelne&s;s and delicacy in the turn of his mu&s;ical phra&s;e (if I may &s;o call it), and &s;uch a natural connection in his expre&s;|&s;ive and &s;weet modulation throughout all his works, which are every where &s;up|ported

with &s;o perfect a harmony, that we can never too often hear, or too much admire them.

This it is properly to di&s;cour&s;e in Mu&s;ic, when our attention is kept up from one pa&s;&s;age to another, &s;o as the ear and the mind may be equally delighted.</P>
<P>From an academy formed under &s;uch a <HI>genius,</HI> what a &s;upreme excellence of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> might be expected<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>To &s;hew on what foundation this improvement in the mu&s;ical &s;cience may be re&s;ted, I will take the liberty to add the following remarks, from two unque&s;tionable authorities on this head.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is from my Lord SHAFTESBURY, in his <HI>letter concerning de&s;ign.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can, my&s;elf, remember the time, when, in re&s;pect of Mu&s;ic, our reigning ta&s;te was, in many degrees, inferior to the <HI>French.</HI> The long reign of luxury and plea&s;ure under king <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and the foreign helps and &s;tudied ad|vantages given to Mu&s;ic in a following reign, could not rai&s;e our genius the lea&s;t in this re&s;pect. But when the &s;pirit of the nation was grown more free, though engaged at that time in the fierce&s;t war, and with the mo&s;t doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, we no &s;ooner began to turn our&s;elves towards Mu&s;ic, and enquire what <HI>Italy</HI> in particular pro|duced, than, in an in&s;tant, we out-&s;tripped our neighbours the <HI>French,</HI> entered into a genius far beyond theirs, and rai&s;ed our&s;elves an ear and judgement, not inferior to the be&s;t now in the world."</Q></P>
<P>And now, to ob&s;erve with what improper regard this art has &s;ince been treated, we need only advert to the next remark from GEMINIANI's <HI>Introduction to a good Ta&s;te in Mu&s;ic.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When I came fir&s;t to <HI>London,</HI> which was thirty|four years ago, I found Mu&s;ic in &s;o thriving a &s;tate, that I had all the rea&s;on imaginable to &s;up|po&s;e the growth would be &s;uitable to the excel|lency of the &s;oil. But I have lived to be mo&s;t mi&s;erably di&s;appointed; for, though it cannot be &s;aid that there was any want of encouragement, that encouragement was ill be&s;towed. The hand was more con&s;idered than the head; the perfor|mance than the compo&s;ition; and hence it fol|lowed, that, in&s;tead of labouring to cultivate a ta&s;te, which &s;eemed to be all that was wanting, the public was content to nouri&s;h in&s;ipidity."</Q></P>
<P>This great ma&s;ter's fir&s;t arrival among&s;t us &s;eems to have been much about that time, which the noble author above-mentioned hath fixed for the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Mu&s;ic, and his &s;entiments herein, I dare &s;ay, will appear rea&s;onable and fair to every impartial judge of the &s;ubject before us; e&s;pecially, as he hath done us the ju&s;tice to a&s;&s;ert, that Mu&s;ic, by proper culture and encouragement, may be brought to as great perfection in <HI>England,</HI> as in any other nation.</P></NOTE>!</P>

<P>Again, as the <HI>compo&s;er</HI> is culpable, who, for the &s;ake of &s;ome low and trifling <HI>imitation,</HI> de&s;erts the beauties of <HI>expre&s;|&s;ion:</HI> &s;o, that <HI>performer</HI> is &s;till more cul|pable, who is indu&s;trious to reduce a good in&s;trument to the &s;tate of a bad one, by endeavouring to make it &s;ub&s;ervient to a &s;till more trifling <HI>mimickry.</HI></P>
<P>Such are all imitations of <HI>flageolets, horns, bagpipes,</HI> &amp;c. on the violin; a kind of low device, calculated merely to amaze, and which, even with the com|mon ear, cannot long prevail over the na|tural love of harmony<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;inging of a <HI>cuckoo,</HI> and the cackling of a hen, have, in fact, been often introduced into mu&s;ical performances. VIVALDI, in his &s;ea&s;ons, or con|certos, &s;o called, has imitated the barking of a dog; be&s;ides many other &s;trange contrivances; attempting even to de&s;cribe, as well as imitate, the various changes of the elements.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e compo&s;ers, who take &s;uch plea&s;ure in their mu&s;ical imitations of the noi&s;e of animals, will &s;hew their ingenuity in that way, I would advi&s;e them rather to follow the much more effectual me|thod of introducing the creatures them&s;elves. And, by way of example, I &s;hall give them the following &s;tory, as it is related by Mr. BAYLE, in his Critical Dictionary, under the article of LEWIS XI. <Q REND="inline">"The Abbot DE BAIGNE, a man of great wit, had in|vented many things relating to mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments; and, being in the &s;ervice of the king, was once commanded by him to procure him harmo|nious &s;ounds from the cries of hogs, imagining the thing was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. The Abbot was not in the lea&s;t perplexed at &s;uch a command, but a&s;ked the king money to perform it; which was immediately delivered to him, and he effected the mo&s;t &s;urprizing and remarkable thing that was ever heard. He got together a large quantity of hogs, all of different ages, and put them into a tent or pavillion covered with velvet, before which tent there was a wooden table all painted; and he made an organical in&s;trument with a cer|tain number of &s;tops &s;o contrived, that, when he hit upon tho&s;e &s;tops, it an&s;wered to &s;ome &s;pikes, which, pricking the hogs that &s;tood behind in a due order, made them cry in &s;uch a harmonious manner, that the king and all his attendants were highly delighted with it."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="103">
Even the u&s;e of double &s;tops on this in&s;trument may, in my opinion, be con|&s;idered as one of the abu&s;es of it; &s;ince, in the hands of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters, they only deaden the tone, &s;poil the expre&s;|&s;ion, and ob&s;truct the execution. In a
<PB N="97" REF="104">
word, they baffle the performer's art, and bring down <HI>one good</HI> in&s;trument to the &s;tate of <HI>two indifferent ones.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;urely it ought chiefly to be the compo&s;er's care, not to give the performer any opportunities whatever of di&s;paraging his art: and the more he avoids all &s;uch low buffoonry, the more will this fal&s;e ta&s;te be di&s;couraged: for whatever may be alledged again&s;t the depravity of our ta&s;te in the mu&s;ical &s;cience, it certainly can be fixed no where &s;o properly, as on the ma&s;ters them&s;elves; &s;ince, were they to per&s;i&s;t with any &s;pirit or re&s;olution in the exerci&s;e of their genius in &s;uch com|po&s;itions only as are worthy of them, they would undoubtedly improve the public ear, and acquire to them&s;elves a reputa|tion and character worth pre&s;erving<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">There is one circum&s;tance, that might tend greatly to the repute and utility of Mu&s;ic; which is, that the profe&s;&s;ors them&s;elves would cultivate a &s;in|cere and friendly commerce with each other, and cheri&s;h that benevolent temper, which their daily employ, one &s;hould think, ought naturally to in|&s;pire. In truth, there is nothing enlarges the mind to every &s;ocial and laudable purpo&s;e, &s;o much as this delightful intercour&s;e with harmony.

<P><PB N="98" REF="105">
Let every compo&s;er, whether for the church, the theatre, or chamber, thorough|ly con&s;ider the nature and compa&s;s of the voices, or in&s;truments, that are employed in his work; and, by that means, he will the more ea&s;ily avoid the common error of not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hing what &s;tile or manner is proper for execution, and what for expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;hould al&s;o minutely ob&s;erve the different qualities of the in&s;truments them|&s;elves: for, as vocal Mu&s;ic requires one kind of expre&s;&s;ion, and in&s;trumental an|other; &s;o different in&s;truments have al&s;o a different expre&s;&s;ion peculiar to them.</P>
<P>Thus, the <HI>hautboy</HI> will be&s;t expre&s;s the <HI>cantabile,</HI> or &s;inging &s;tyle, and may be u&s;ed in all movements whatever under

this denomination; e&s;pecially tho&s;e move|ments which tend to the <HI>gay</HI> and <HI>chearful.</HI></P>
<P>In compo&s;itions for the <HI>German</HI> flute, is required the &s;ame method of proceeding by <HI>conjoint degrees,</HI> or &s;uch other natural intervals, as, with the nature of its tone, will be&s;t expre&s;s the langui&s;hing, or me|lancholy &s;tyle. With both the&s;e in&s;tru|ments, the running into <HI>extreme keys,</HI> the u&s;e of the <HI>&s;taccato,</HI> or di&s;tinct &s;eparation of notes; and all irregular leaps, or broken and uneven intervals, mu&s;t be avoided; for which rea&s;on alone, the&s;e in&s;truments ought never to be employed in the <HI>repieno parts</HI> of concertos for violins, but in &s;uch pieces only as are compo&s;ed for them; and the&s;e, perhaps, would be mo&s;t agree|ably introduced as principal in&s;truments in &s;ome intervening movements in the concerto, which might not only give a plea&s;ing variety, but &s;hew their different expre&s;&s;ion to the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>In continued compo&s;itions, particularly for the <HI>German</HI> flute, our compo&s;ers have been not a little un&s;ucce&s;sful; but whe|ther
<PB N="100" REF="107">
this failure may be imputed to the deficiency of the in&s;trument, or their at|tempting to exceed its natural expre&s;&s;ion, may, perhaps, be worth the compo&s;er's while to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The <HI>ba&s;&s;oon</HI> &s;hould al&s;o have tho&s;e gra|dual movements which naturally glide in their divi&s;ions, and have the ea&s;ie&s;t tran&s;i|tions from one key to another; and may be admitted as a <HI>principal</HI> in the <HI>&s;olo,</HI> or <HI>rinforzo</HI> in the <HI>chorus,</HI> but never in the latter without a &s;ufficient number of other ba&s;&s;es to qualify and &s;upport it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ixth of GEMINIANI's Concertos, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> where there is one movement com|po&s;ed expre&s;sly for the ba&s;&s;oon; the agreeable effect of which, may be &s;ufficient to evince how much better this method is of introducing wind-in&s;tru|ments, than admitting them throughout the con|certo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>trumpet</HI> and <HI>French-horn,</HI> though equally limited in their <HI>&s;cale,</HI> yet have pieces of very different &s;tyles adapted to them. The one, perhaps, to animate and in&s;pire courage; the other to enliven and chear the &s;pirits; yet are not both to be
<PB N="101" REF="108">
alike di&s;carded in the <HI>figurate de&s;cant,</HI> or that part of compo&s;ition where di&s;cords are concerned. In this &s;pecies of har|mony I have known the French-horn in|troduced with amazing &s;ucce&s;s; but it re|quires a very able compo&s;er to manage it properly with &s;uch accompanyments. Either of the&s;e in&s;truments, when fully accompanied, produce more wonderful effects than when heard alone, becau&s;e in all martial compo&s;itions, their airs and expre&s;&s;ion are of &s;o plain and unmixed a nature, that their harmony is more ea&s;ily comprehended; and thence they &s;trike the common ear with a greater degree of plea&s;ure and admiration than any other in|&s;trument whatever.</P>
<P>The <HI>organ</HI> and <HI>harp&s;ichord,</HI> though alike in &s;o many re&s;pects, that the &s;ame per|former may equally &s;hew his &s;kill and execution on both; yet are their re&s;pec|tive compo&s;itions and manner of per|formance widely different: the former expre&s;&s;ing the grand or &s;olemn &s;tile, the
<PB N="102" REF="109">
latter, tho&s;e lively or trickling movements which thrill in the ear.</P>
<P>Now, where any of the above in&s;tru|ments over-rule in concert, whether in the chorus, or &s;olo; or are appointed to play &s;uch airs or movements as they can|not ea&s;ily expre&s;s; we may then conclude, that the compo&s;er hath unfortunately &s;et out upon a wrong principle, which capital error will de&s;troy every good effect that might have been found in his work, had he duly con&s;idered the di&s;tinct limits and properties of each in&s;trument.</P>
<P>In cla&s;&s;ing the different in&s;truments in concert, we may con&s;ider them as the various &s;tops which complete a good or|gan: and as the &s;killful arti&s;t &s;o contrives, that, when the full organ is heard, no <HI>mixtures,</HI> or <HI>furnitures,</HI> &amp;c. &s;hall predo|minate, but that the <HI>diapa&s;ons,</HI> with their <HI>octaves</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Principals and flutes.</NOTE>, may unite and fill the whole; &s;o we may rank the <HI>violins</HI> with their <HI>ba&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>double-ba&s;&s;es,</HI> as the <HI>diapa&s;ons</HI> and
<PB N="103" REF="110">
<HI>principals</HI> of the concert: for in fact they may be &s;aid to contain the very &s;trength and &s;pirit of all harmony; and have in them, not only the expre&s;&s;ion of all the other in&s;truments, but contain a prodigi|ous variety of many other noble proper|ties peculiar to them&s;elves, of which all the re&s;t are utterly de&s;titute. It is their remarkable di&s;tinction, that no concert can be formed without them, as they unite and agree as well with every in&s;tru|ment, as with each other, and return every advantage they receive. And, as the fine&s;t <HI>in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic</HI> may be con|&s;idered as an imitation of the <HI>vocal;</HI> &s;o do the&s;e in&s;truments, with their expre&s;&s;ive tone and the minute&s;t changes they are capable of in the progre&s;&s;ion of melody, &s;hew their neare&s;t approaches to the per|fection of the human voice.</P>
<P>Let the lover of Mu&s;ic call to mind the delightful effects they afford, when joined with the organ to a chorus of good voices, particularly in churches where the expan&s;ion is large and ample, to &s;often
<PB N="104" REF="111">
every rough and grating &s;ound, and unite the variety of voices and other in&s;tru|ments, that complete this grand and &s;o|lemn performance; he will, even in this ideal enjoyment of Mu&s;ic, with plea&s;ure own and prefer their harmonious expre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>In fine, it is in tho&s;e productions only which include the violin and its &s;pecies, where an exten&s;ive genius may rove at large through all the various kinds of mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion; and may give the be&s;t performers, though not in capricious and extravagant flights, every de&s;irable opportunity of &s;hewing their &s;kill.</P>
<P>As a remarkable in&s;tance of the power of expre&s;&s;ion in a performance on this in|&s;trument, I cannot omit the mention of three ma&s;ters, within my own knowledge. KNERLER, with great execution and a fine tone, but un&s;u&s;ceptible of the powers of expre&s;&s;ion, always di&s;appointed the ex|pecting ear: CARBONEL, with but a com|mon portion of tho&s;e qualities &s;o requi&s;ite to enforce an expre&s;&s;ion, by a natural and
<PB N="105" REF="112">
in&s;tant feeling of the tender &s;trokes in a fine compo&s;ition, never failed to give all the plea&s;ure that could be expected from them. But if we would hear the&s;e vari|ous qualities united in their full perfec|tion, we mu&s;t repair to the admired GIARDINI. The brilliancy and Fullne&s;s of his tone, the &s;weetne&s;s, &s;pirit, and va|riety of his expre&s;&s;ion, his amazing rapi|dity of execution, and exuberance of fancy, joined with the mo&s;t perfect ea&s;e and gracefulne&s;s in the performance, con|cur to &s;et him at the head of his <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>Since the appearance of this great performer, the Signiors PLA, PASSARINI, and CHABRAN, have al&s;o excited the admiration of the town: yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> all, it is but too general an ob&s;ervation (and I cannot help repeating it) that even the greate&s;t per|formers, when left to them&s;elves, cannot re&s;i&s;t the vanity of amazing the multitude.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, the judicious hearer will always prefer their accompanyment in vocal performances, where every kind of unmeaning execution mu&s;t give way to a more natural harmony; and their happier talents are employed, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the voice, through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the various beauties of <HI>true</HI> mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion.</P></NOTE>pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="113">
Thus, the judicious performer, by this exertion of his <HI>fort</HI> or ma&s;ter-&s;tyle, may po&s;&s;ibly give a plea&s;ing tenderne&s;s or &s;pi|rit, even to an indifferent compo&s;ition; while, on the other hand, a neglect, or ignorance, of the u&s;e of this art, however expert in other re&s;pects the performer may be, will di&s;gui&s;e, if not intirely de|&s;troy, tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed beauties, which alone can rai&s;e the dignity and perfection of Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay the reader will anticipate the &s;imilar ca&s;e I am about to mention in re|gard to <HI>reading;</HI> as it will naturally occur to him, on this head, how commanding the power of expre&s;&s;ion may be found, from a different manner of reading the &s;ame author; e&s;pecially in poetry, where a ju&s;t and &s;pirited empha&s;is is &s;o highly e&s;&s;ential to point out tho&s;e intere&s;ting &s;trokes, which are more peculiarly de|&s;igned to delight the imagination and af|fect the heart. But how infinitely &s;hort of this de&s;ign, is the be&s;t-wrote poem, whether we hear it rehear&s;ed with wild

<P>The different &s;pecies of Mu&s;ic, for the <HI>church,</HI> the <HI>theatre,</HI> or the <HI>chamber,</HI> are, or &s;hould be, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their peculiar expre&s;&s;ion.

A well|wrought <HI>allegro,</HI> or any other quick movement for the church, cannot, with propriety, be adapted to theatrical pur|po&s;es; nor can the <HI>adagio</HI> of this latter kind, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be introduced in|to the former: I have known &s;everal ex|periments of this nature attempted, but never with &s;ucce&s;s. For, the &s;ame pieces which may ju&s;tly enough be thought very &s;olemn in the theatre, to an expe|rienced

ear, will be found too light and trivial, when they are performed in the church: and this, I may venture to a&s;|&s;ert, would be the ca&s;e, though we had never heard them but in &s;ome anthem, or other divine performance: and were, therefore, not &s;ubject to the prejudice, which their being heard in an opera might occa&s;ion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"By the <HI>ancients, airs</HI> were &s;ung in three dif|ferent manners; for the theatre, the &s;tyle was lively and various; for the chamber, delicate and fini&s;hed; for the church, moving and grave.

<P>It is al&s;o by this efficacy of mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, that a good ear doth a&s;certain the various terms which are generally made u&s;e of to direct the performer. For in&s;tance, the words <HI>andante, pre&s;to, allegro,</HI> &amp;c. are differently applied in the different kinds of Mu&s;ic above-mention|ed: for, the &s;ame terms which denote <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>gay,</HI> in the opera, or concert &s;tyle, may be under&s;tood in the practice

of church-mu&s;ic, as, <HI>chearful</HI> and <HI>&s;erene,</HI> or, if the reader plea&s;es, le&s;s lively and gay: wherefore, the <HI>allegro,</HI> &amp;c. in this kind of compo&s;ition, &s;hould always be performed &s;omewhat &s;lower than is u&s;ual in concertos or operas.</P>
<P>By this ob&s;ervation we may learn, that the&s;e words do not always convey what they import in their &s;trict &s;en&s;e, but are to be con&s;idered as relative terms; and if they cannot fully an&s;wer the compo&s;er's intention of communicating, to every per|former, the nature of each particular &s;tyle; yet, are they more proper than any other for that purpo&s;e: however, the compo&s;er will always be &s;ubject to a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of leaving great latitude to the per|former; who, neverthele&s;s, may be great|ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted therein, by his perception of the powers of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In vocal Mu&s;ic he can never fail; be|cau&s;e, if the different pa&s;&s;ions which the poet intends to rai&s;e, are ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed and expre&s;&s;ed by the compo&s;er's art; the &s;en&s;ible performer will feel this happy
<PB N="110" REF="117">
union of both the arts, and thence join his own to perfect the whole.</P>
<P>With regard to the in&s;trumental kind; the <HI>&s;tyle</HI> and <HI>air</HI> of the <HI>movement</HI> mu&s;t chiefly determine the exact <HI>time</HI> and <HI>men|ner,</HI> in which it ought to be performed: and unle&s;s we &s;trictly attend to this di|&s;tinction, the mo&s;t excellent compo&s;itions may be greatly injured, e&s;pecially when the compo&s;er is not pre&s;ent, either to lead, or give the <HI>air</HI> of his piece.</P>
<P>I might conclude this head with an ob&s;ervation or two on the &s;everal <HI>graces</HI> or ornaments of expre&s;&s;ion: but as the&s;e are already enumerated, and &s;ufficiently explained in the rules of GEMINIANI, I need only refer to that work. However, we may here remark, that, were the&s;e elements of playing in ta&s;te, with their di&s;tinct characters and explanations, be|come the general &s;tandard, as well for the performance of ma&s;ters, as for the in|&s;truction of their pupils; the former, I believe, would not only find them capable of heightening the very be&s;t compo&s;itions,
<PB N="111" REF="118">
but the latter would al&s;o, with greater fa|cility, arrive at perfection. But, in&s;tead of this, the generality of our ma&s;ters, following each their own method, have preferred a more loo&s;e and florid manner of gracing, by which the fine&s;t harmo|nies are too often de&s;troyed; and in their explanation of the&s;e graces, by &s;o many different marks, and crowds of little notes, impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;ed, have rather perplexed the learner, who, find|ing the &s;ame art &s;o variou&s;ly taught, hath, therefore, been often di&s;couraged in the progre&s;s of his &s;tudy.</P>
<P>And, as we have di&s;tingui&s;hed this ma&s;ter, as a pattern of excellence in his <HI>compo&s;itions,</HI> &s;o we mu&s;t allow him to have been equally excellent in his <HI>per|formance;</HI> for, in this re&s;pect, he was al&s;o peculiarly happy in his various expre&s;|&s;ion, as well of the <HI>tender,</HI> the <HI>&s;erene,</HI> the <HI>&s;olemn,</HI> as of the <HI>joyous</HI> and <HI>rapid;</HI> and, with a ready and proper execution, al|ways entered into a true feeling of the &s;pirit, or &s;oftne&s;s, &s;uitable to each of the&s;e

<HEAD>SECT. II. ON THE EXPRESSIVE PERFORMANCES OF MUSIC IN PARTS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;aid &s;o much with regard to the expre&s;&s;ive performance of Mu&s;ic in general, I &s;hall now conclude with a few hints which may be of &s;ervice in the performance of full Mu&s;ic: e&s;pecially of &s;uch <HI>concertos</HI> as have pretty near an equal &s;hare of <HI>air</HI> and <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> in all their parts.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="120">
The fir&s;t material circum&s;tance which ought to be con&s;idered in the performance of this kind of compo&s;ition, is, the number and quality of tho&s;e in&s;truments that may produce the be&s;t effect.</P>
<P>And, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> I would propo&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the four principal parts which mu&s;t be always complete, that the chorus of other in&s;truments &s;hould not exceed the num|ber following, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ix <HI>primo,</HI> and four <HI>&s;econdo repienos;</HI> four <HI>repieno ba&s;&s;es,</HI> and two <HI>double ba&s;&s;es,</HI> and a <HI>harp&s;ichord.</HI> A le&s;&s;er number of in&s;truments, near the &s;ame proportion, will al&s;o have a proper effect, and may an&s;wer the compo&s;er's intention; but more would probably de|&s;troy the ju&s;t contra&s;t, which &s;hould al|ways be kept up between the <HI>chorus</HI> and <HI>&s;olo:</HI> for in this ca&s;e the effect of two or three &s;ingle in&s;truments would be lo&s;t and over-powered by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of too grand a <HI>chorus;</HI> and to double the <HI>primo,</HI> and <HI>&s;econdo concertino,</HI> or <HI>violoncello</HI> in the <HI>&s;olo,</HI> would be an impropriety in the con|duct of our mu&s;ical oeconomy, too ob|vious
<PB N="114" REF="121">
to require any thing to be &s;aid on that head. It may be objected, perhaps, that the number of <HI>ba&s;&s;es,</HI> in the above calculation, would be found too powerful for the <HI>violins:</HI> but as the latter in&s;tru|ments are in their tone &s;o clear, &s;prightly, and piercing, and as they rather gain more force by this addition, they will always be heard: however, if it were po&s;&s;ible, there &s;hould never be wanting a <HI>double ba&s;s;</HI> e&s;pecially in a performance of full con|certos, as they cannot be heard to any advantage without that NOBLE FOUNDA|TION of their harmony.</P>
<P>As to wind-in&s;truments, the&s;e are all &s;o different in their tone, and in their progre&s;&s;ions through the various keys, from tho&s;e of the &s;tringed kind, be&s;ides the irremediable di&s;agreement of their ri&s;ing in their pitch, while the others are probably falling, that they &s;hould nei|ther be continued too long in u&s;e, nor employed but in &s;uch pieces as are ex|pre&s;sly adapted to them; &s;o that in the general work of concertos, for violins,
<PB N="115" REF="122">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are almo&s;t always improper; unle&s;s we admit of the <HI>ba&s;&s;oon,</HI> which, if performed by an expert hand, in a &s;oft and ready tone, and only in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;a|ges that are natural to it, may then be of &s;ingular u&s;e, and add fullne&s;s to the harmony.</P>
<P>Did every performer know the <HI>fort</HI> of his in&s;trument, and where its be&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion lay, <HI>there</HI> to exert it mo&s;t; I &s;hould have but little pretence for my pre|&s;ent attempt in the en&s;uing directions.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> In the four principal parts there ought to be four performers of almo&s;t equal ma&s;tery; as well in regard to <HI>time</HI> as <HI>execution;</HI> for however ea&s;y it may &s;eem to acquire the former, yet nothing more &s;hews a ma&s;ter than a &s;teady per|formance throughout the whole move|ment, and therefore chiefly nece&s;&s;ary in the leading parts. But this rule is gene|rally neglected by placing one of the wor&s;t hands to the <HI>tenor;</HI> which, though a part of little execution, yet requires &s;o much meaning and expre&s;&s;ion, that the
<PB N="116" REF="123">
performer &s;hould not only give a fine tone, (the peculiar quality of that in&s;trument) but by &s;welling and &s;inging of the notes, and entering into the &s;pirit of the com|po&s;er, know, without de&s;troying the <HI>air,</HI> where to fill the <HI>harmony;</HI> and, by boldly pointing the &s;ubject, keep it up with the greate&s;t energy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>As when we find a ju&s;t and happy &s;ub&s;erviency in all the under parts of a compo&s;ition, we conclude the compo&s;er to be a man of experience and good &s;en&s;e: &s;o al&s;o, tho&s;e only are the performers or di&s;|cernment and good ta&s;te, who can feel, and, with delight, expre&s;s tho&s;e beauties undi&s;tingui&s;hed by the common ear.</P>
<P>It is their part al&s;o to di&s;cern, how little it avails, to attempt any &s;ervice in the performance, where the&s;e attendants to the principal part, are either &s;uperfluous in them&s;elves, or inharmonious in their effect; and where they de&s;troy, in&s;tead of aiding the <HI>ma&s;ter-&s;ubject,</HI> or other appointed <HI>airs</HI> in the piece.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> The &s;ame rule will &s;erve for all the other in&s;truments except the <HI>harp&s;i|chord;</HI> and as this is only to be u&s;ed in the <HI>chorus,</HI> the performer will have little el&s;e to regard but the &s;triking ju&s;t chords, keeping the time, and being careful that no jangling &s;ound or &s;cattering of the
<PB N="117" REF="124">
notes be continued after the pau&s;e or ca|dence. During this interval of re&s;t, he &s;hould al&s;o attend, with the utmo&s;t exact|ne&s;s, the leading off again the remaining part of the movement, that when all the parts are thus in&s;tantly &s;truck, his own may be found to pervade and fill the whole: and if there are any re&s;ts &s;uc|ceeding the pau&s;e, his attention to the leading in&s;trument will direct him when the&s;e are to commence. The &s;ame care is nece&s;&s;ary at the return of each double &s;train, when there are no intermediate notes to introduce the repeat. In fine, a profound &s;ilence mu&s;t be always ob&s;erv|ed, wherever the compo&s;er has intended a general re&s;pite, or pau&s;e in his work. I am the more particular in giving this caution to performers on the harp&s;ichord, as they are the mo&s;t liable to tran&s;gre&s;s in this way; becau&s;e their in&s;trument, lying &s;o commodious to their fingers, is ever tempting them to run like wild-fire over the keys, and thus perpetually interrupt the performance. As compo&s;itions of
<PB N="118" REF="125">
this nature are not calculated for the &s;ake of any one in&s;trument, but to give a grand effect by uniting many, each performer ought therefore to con&s;ider his particular province, and &s;o far only to exert him&s;elf as may be con&s;i&s;tent with the harmony and expre&s;&s;ion in his part. Nor let any lover of Mu&s;ic be concerned if there is but little for him to execute, &s;ince he will thence have &s;ome lei&s;ure for the plea&s;ure of hearing: for this rea&s;on, the under parts in good compo&s;itions are more eli|gible to the performer, who would rather enjoy the whole than be di&s;tingui&s;hed alone.</P>

<PB N="119" REF="126">
accompanyment of a fine voice, or &s;in|gle in&s;trument; and therefore, be&s;ides the difficulty of acquiring a competent &s;kill in them, they are not required in the per|formance of full Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Under this article I &s;hall beg leave to offer an ob&s;ervation on the harp&s;i|chord concerto; a &s;pecies of compo&s;ition but of late invention, and which, if pro|perly &s;tudied, will admit of con&s;iderable improvements. Hitherto we &s;eem to have mi&s;taken the property of this in&s;trument, by not con&s;idering what it can, or cannot expre&s;s. Hence it is, perhaps, that our compo&s;ers have run all their concertos into little el&s;e than tedious divi&s;ions; and the &s;ubject or ground-work of the&s;e, being introduced and repeated by a chorus of violins, produce always a bad effect: whereas the violin parts &s;hould be but few, and contrived rather as accompanyments than &s;ymphonies; by which means they may a&s;&s;i&s;t greatly in &s;triking out &s;ome kind of expre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="120" REF="127">
wherein the harp&s;ichord<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See RAMEAU's concertos for the harp&s;ichord, publi&s;hed by Mr. WALSH.</NOTE> is remarkably deficient<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Performers on the harp&s;ichord, in concertos for that in&s;trument, ought to take notice, that <HI>&s;taccato divi&s;ions,</HI> on one note, &s;hould be played with differ|ent fingers, wherever it can be done with conve|nience; and not with one finger only, becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible to move the wri&s;t (which the quick repetition of one note with one finger would require) with freedom enough to give the&s;e kind of pa&s;&s;ages their proper force.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method, perhaps, may be equally proper in concertos for the organ: which being frequently employed in other compo&s;itions, and at pre&s;ent &s;o generally approved, it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider it farther. For however capable this in|&s;trument may be found to fill or &s;often all the re&s;t, it will neverthele&s;s over-power and de&s;troy them, if the performer is not extremely cautious and tender in the u&s;e of it. I would therefore propo&s;e that the accompanyments in the thorough-ba&s;s &s;hould never be &s;truck in chords with the right-hand, as upon the harp&s;ichord, but
<PB N="121" REF="128">
in all the full parts the leading &s;ubject &s;hould be &s;ingly touched, and the per|former proceed through the re&s;t of the movement with the left-hand only.

Yet I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this article without once again ob&s;erving, that the difficulties of render|ing the organ of that u&s;e in full concert which many expect from it, are &s;o various and intricate, that we can never be too careful of the performer's abilities; who, if thoroughly &s;killful, will &s;o manage his in&s;trument, that it may always be heard, but &s;eldom di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> As in all concertos, overtures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where the <HI>repieno</HI> parts are more im|mediately nece&s;&s;ary, the compo&s;er ought to pur&s;ue &s;ome de&s;ign in filling each chorus, and relieving them with pa&s;&s;ages

either proper to be heard alone, or &s;o contrived as to give a good effect to the repeated <HI>chorus;</HI> &s;o in performing the&s;e different pa&s;&s;ages, a different manner mu&s;t be ob&s;erved. Thus, when the <HI>&s;olo</HI> is contrived for the &s;ake of &s;ome peculiar expre&s;&s;ion, it &s;hould then be performed in a manner &s;uitable to the genius or character of the piece; but always plain, or however with &s;uch graces only as may heighten the expre&s;&s;ion without varying the time; and which, therefore, require other qualities be&s;ides an execution to do them ju&s;tice: for this elegance of ta&s;te, in the performance of the &s;olo, con&s;i&s;ts not in tho&s;e agile motions, or &s;hiftings of the hand, which &s;trike with &s;urprize the common ear, but in the tender and delicate touches, which to &s;uch indeed are lea&s;t perceptible, but to a fine ear productive of the highe&s;t delight. Let not the performer then by an ill-judged execution mi&s;apply this opportunity of &s;hewing his &s;kill in the&s;e remarkable places: for though it is not the advant|age

It is a common practice with tho&s;e luke-warm performers, who imagine that dimini&s;hing the num|ber of in&s;truments will an&s;wer the &s;ame end as &s;oftening the whole, to quit their part when they &s;hould rather be all at|tention how to manage it with the utmo&s;t delicacy; tran&s;porting, as it were, like the &s;well-organ, the le&s;&s;ening &s;ounds to a va&s;t di&s;tance, and thence returning with redoubled &s;trength and fullne&s;s to the <HI>forte:</HI> and as this delightful effect can only be found from a performance of many in&s;truments together, we ought never to omit &s;uch opportunities of car|rying this noble contra&s;t to its highe&s;t perfection.</P>

becomes an accompanyment; which ge|nerally happens in well-wrought fugues and other full pieces, where the &s;ubject and air are almo&s;t equally di&s;tributed. When the attention of every performer is thus employed by li&s;tening to the other parts, without which he cannot do ju&s;tice to his own, it is then we may expect to hear the proper effect of the whole.</P>
<P>9<HI>thly,</HI> In every part throughout the full chorus, all manner of graces, or di|minution of intervals, or tran&s;po&s;ition of eight notes higher, mu&s;t be avoided; which &s;ome indi&s;creet performers are but too apt to make u&s;e of, merely from a de&s;ire of being di&s;tingui&s;hed, and that the audience may admire their execution. But the&s;e gentlemen ought to con&s;ider, that by &s;uch liberties they do not only di&s;|appoint the expecting ear, of a ju&s;t per|formance of &s;ome favourite part, but often introduce and occa&s;ion <HI>di&s;allowances</HI> in the harmony. From the &s;ame ruling pa&s;&s;ion we &s;ometimes hear performers, the moment a piece is ended, run over their

in&s;trument, forgetting that order, like &s;ilence under arms in the military di&s;ci|pline, &s;hould al&s;o be ob&s;erved in the di&s;|cipline of Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> To point out in all the parts of full Mu&s;ic, their various &s;ubjects or fugues, I have ventured to introduce a new mu&s;ical character, namely, this mo&s;tra (<GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">) or index: but as the particular u&s;e I would apply it to, may po&s;&s;ibly be thought by &s;ome, a groundle&s;s innovation, it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;ome|thing in its defence and explanation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See &s;ix concertos publi&s;hed by JOHNSON, where the u&s;e of this mark is applied: as this character is ea&s;ily made by the pen, it may, with very little trouble, be added to the proper places, either in manu&s;cript or other printed concertos that require it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In all compo&s;itions for in&s;truments in parts, which are publi&s;hed in &s;eparate books, and &s;eldom peru&s;ed in <HI>&s;core,</HI> mo&s;t performers are frequently at a lo&s;s, to know the compo&s;er's de&s;ign: hence pro|ceed many di&s;cordant <HI>ricercate</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Extempore flouri&s;hings.</NOTE>, where
<PB N="130" REF="137">
only the full unmixed harmony &s;hould be heard. Another con&s;equence has been, that, for want of &s;ome &s;uch character as the mo&s;tra above-mentioned, the very be&s;t contrivances in a good compo&s;ition have often pa&s;&s;ed undi&s;tingui&s;hed and neglected. To remedy this defect, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to point out in each part every <HI>leading</HI> and <HI>re&s;pon&s;ive</HI> fugue: for which purpo&s;e &s;ome particular mark &s;hould be placed over the fir&s;t note of every <HI>accidental</HI> &s;ubject as well as <HI>princi|pal;</HI> the former being rather more nece&s;|&s;ary to be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, as every per|&s;on capable of performing in concert mu&s;t know the principal &s;ubject wherever it occurs, and therefore will of cour&s;e give <HI>that</HI> its proper expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the <HI>accidental</HI> &s;ubjects are, on ac|count of their variety, much more difficult to be a&s;certained: &s;ometimes indeed they are a part or accompanyment of the <HI>principal,</HI> and then may be &s;tyled a &s;e|cond or third &s;ubject, as they are gene|rally repeated, or at lea&s;t &s;o retouched in
<PB N="131" REF="138">
the progre&s;s of the fugue as to render them ea&s;ily known. But yet there are oftentimes other &s;ubjects very different from the principal, and which being &s;el|dom or never repeated, are therefore &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to be marked; for having always &s;ome peculiar relation to the other parts, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed; and this can only be done by a &s;imple, plain, yet ener|getic execution: for wherever a &s;ubject is propo&s;ed, it can never with propriety admit of any variation. Expre&s;&s;ion alone being &s;ufficient to give us every thing that can be de&s;ired from harmony.</P>
<P>Thus, by a due ob&s;ervance of &s;ome &s;uch character as the <HI>mo&s;tra,</HI> the per|former will be greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted to compre|hend all the harmony and contrivances of the compo&s;er, and obtain an advantage and plea&s;ure almo&s;t equal to that of play|ing from the &s;core<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>Though we may partly conjecture at the ex|cellence of the <HI>air</HI> and <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of particular pa&s;&s;ages in a compo&s;ition, without a complete performance in all the parts; yet of the <HI>harmony</HI> and relation the&s;e may bear to each other, we cannot form a peremptory judgement: and more e&s;pecially as we are often de|ceived in our opinions of full Mu&s;ic, from tho&s;e faint and imperfect trials, to which, for want of proper hands, they are frequently expo&s;ed; where the&s;e are deficient, whether in number or abilities, I know not a more effectual te&s;t than a good harp&s;ichord and performance from the <HI>&s;core,</HI> where the eye will a&s;&s;i&s;t the ear through all the defects of this in&s;trument, and give a better idea of the compo&s;er's de&s;ign than any un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt in concert.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, were the printers of Mu&s;ic to publi&s;h the be&s;t <HI>concertos</HI> and <HI>&s;onatas</HI> in <HI>&s;core,</HI> as are tho&s;e of CORELLI; perhaps this very expedient, though it may &s;eem hazardous at fir&s;t, would con|tribute more to a general good ta&s;te and knowledge of Mu&s;ic, than any yet thought of; and the &s;ucce&s;s that may rea&s;onably be expected from &s;o u&s;eful an undertaking, will, in the long-run, amply reward them for all their trouble and expence.</P>
<P>I have heard the fir&s;t publi&s;her of CORELLI's works in &s;core, very frankly acknowledge, that the profits received from the &s;ale of the&s;e books, were greater than could have been expected: and, as the public has had almo&s;t twenty years trial of the ad|vantages that have accrued from &s;uch an intimate acquaintance with this cla&s;&s;ical compo&s;er; it cannot, I think, be doubted but a like good effect might al&s;o attend a publication in &s;core of GEMINIANI's concertos; and of other compo&s;itions in parts, which may have de&s;ervedly gained a reputation.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Mu&s;ic of the Ancients and of the Moderns hath been often and fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the learned, and I have only a &s;lender and &s;uperficial knowledge of the theory either of the former or of the latter. What is it then that I can offer you upon this &s;ubject? In truth nothing better than a few &s;traggling pa&s;|&s;ages of <HI>cla&s;&s;ic authors</HI> relating to Mu&s;ic, and a few &s;light remarks added to them.</P>

i. e. <HI>He &s;ang &s;ometimes in the note of the upper &s;tring, &s;ometimes in that of the lowe&s;t &s;tring of the tetrachord.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>tetrachord</HI> here is to be con&s;ider|ed, not as a particular in&s;trument, but as four &s;trings bearing a certain mu&s;ical pro|portion to each other, of which, in the <HI>diatonic</HI> &s;cale, the &s;econd was a <HI>&s;emitone,</HI> the third a <HI>tone,</HI> and the la&s;t a <HI>tone,</HI> and a <HI>fourth</HI> to the fir&s;t, as the <HI>natural</HI> notes, B, C, D, E. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>fourth,</HI> in all tetrachords, were fixed and immoveable, (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,) and one of them was cal|led <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>&s;umma,</HI> the <HI>highe&s;t;</HI> the other, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>ima,</HI> the <HI>lowe&s;t.</HI> The <HI>highe&s;t</HI> was that chord which gave the <HI>deepe&s;t</HI> or <HI>grave&s;t</HI> &s;ound, the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> that which gave the <HI>acute&s;t</HI> &s;ound; and therefore, what we call ASCENDING, they called DESCEND|ING. Thus for example, if you compare the <HI>open</HI> &s;trings of a violin to the tetra|chord, (though their proportions are not the &s;ame,) the &s;tring which &s;ounds G, would have been with them the <HI>highe&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="144">
and that which &s;ounds E, would have been the <HI>lowe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>As in their tetrachord, their <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> was a <HI>fourth</HI> to their <HI>highe&s;t,</HI> the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Horace</HI> is, that <HI>Tigellius</HI> &s;ang the air, <HI>Io Bacche,</HI> and then would &s;ing it over again, what we call, <HI>a fourth higher. Vox &s;umma</HI> is the ba&s;s, and <HI>vox ima</HI> the treble.</P>
<P>Apply this to the <HI>Mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres.</HI> The old <HI>planetary &s;y&s;tem</HI> may be con&s;i|dered as an <HI>heptachord,</HI> an in&s;trument with &s;even &s;trings, an&s;wering to the &s;even notes in Mu&s;ic. The diameter of the orbit of each planet is the &s;tring. <HI>Saturn,</HI> who is the remote&s;t, and hath the longe&s;t chord, and gives the deepe&s;t &s;ound, is the mu&s;ical <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>highe&s;t;</HI> and he is &s;o de&s;cribed by <HI>Pliny,</HI> and &s;o called by <HI>Nico|machus.</HI> But in &s;ettling this <HI>cele&s;tial har|mony,</HI> the Ancients are by no means agreed; which indeed is no wonder, for <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> is uniform, and <HI>non&s;en&s;e</HI> admits of endle&s;s variations.</P>

<P>Yet one con&s;iderable advantage which aro&s;e even from the &s;implicity of the an|cient tunes, and which greatly &s;et off their concert of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, was that the &s;inger could be under&s;tood, and that the words had their effect as well as the mu&s;ic; and then the charms of ele|gant and pathetic poe&s;y, aided and &s;et off by the voice, per&s;on, manner, and accent of the &s;inger, and by the &s;ound of in&s;tru|ments, might affect the hearer very &s;trongly.

<HI>I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> hath al&s;o &s;ome remarks upon the ancient organ, in his book <HI>De Po&euml;matum Cantu,</HI> which he wrote with a view to extol the Mu&s;ic of the Ancients, and to depre&s;s that of all the moderns, except his favourites, the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> In this treati&s;e, as in mo&s;t of his works, there are &s;ome learned, ingenious, and u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, mixed with others that are fanta&s;tical and extravagant.</P>
<P>As the organs of the Ancients had many pipes and keys; &s;o their lyres or harps had many &s;trings, as fifteen, twenty, &s;ome &s;ay thirty, and more.

<P>One would think that an ancient mu&s;i|cian, who was well acquainted with <HI>concords</HI> and <HI>di&s;cords,</HI> who had an in&s;trument of many &s;trings or many keys to play upon, and two hands and ten fingers to make u&s;e of, would try experiments, and would

<HEAD>A REPLY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for the expedition with which you tran&s;mitted to me the remarks on my e&s;&s;ay. I have, in return, &s;ent you a &s;hort defence of my|&s;elf again&s;t this virulent, though, I flatter my&s;elf, not formidable, antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>If, after looking over the&s;e papers, you &s;hould think that they may &s;erve to rectify the judgements of &s;uch per&s;ons as this writer may probably have mi&s;led, I de|&s;ire you would &s;end them to the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, from the adverti&s;ement of my remarker, I apprehended &s;ome un|due &s;everity; and, notwith&s;tanding he called him&s;elf a gentleman, I had pre|pared my&s;elf for the wor&s;t. My expec|tation has, indeed, been fully an&s;wered:
<PB N="174" REF="180">
in&s;tead of the gentleman, the critic, the candid mu&s;ician; his pamphlet has di&s;|covered him to be a vain, di&s;appointed, &s;narling doctor<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This (were other rea&s;ons wanting) may, I think, &s;afely be concluded, from the pains he takes to make his readers under&s;tand that D &s;tands for Doctor. See his Catalogue of <HI>Antient Engli&s;h Mu&s;icians.</HI> Rem. p. 52.</NOTE> of the &s;cience.</P>
<P>He begins, I think, with a pretty high|flown compliment upon the &s;tyle of my E&s;&s;ay, and &s;ays, that it is writ in a lan|guage not unworthy of our be&s;t pro&s;e|writers; nay, he adds al&s;o, that the per&s;on who drew up the Preface to my Concertos mu&s;t be capable of giving &s;en&s;ible thoughts on other branches of Mu&s;ic<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The writer of the <HI>Remarks</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have alluded to the late Mr. Avi&s;on's ingenious friend Dr. Brown, author of the <HI>E&s;&s;ays on Ld. Shaft&s;bury's Characteri&s;tics.</HI>&mdash;The foregoing <HI>Letter concerning the Mu&s;ic of the Ancients</HI> was written by the learned Dr. Jortin.</NOTE>. But why all this panegyric? only to introduce this very candid in&s;inuation, that I am but the <HI>nominal author</HI> of both one and the other.</P>
<P>To reply to the man him&s;elf, or to offer to clear my&s;elf of this ridiculous
<PB N="175" REF="181">
charge, I think very much beneath me. But I will ob&s;erve to <HI>you,</HI> that when I had determined to publi&s;h &s;ome thoughts on the &s;ubject of Mu&s;ic, by way of Preface to my la&s;t Concertos, I found my fir&s;t de&s;ign, of writing directions to performers only, grew &s;o much upon my hands, that I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation, however unequal to the ta&s;k, or extending them al&s;o to the practice of compo&s;ition. Hav|ing thus attempted a province of writing which was new to me, I thought I could not engage in it with too much caution; and, therefore, had recour&s;e to my learned friends, by who&s;e advice I was induced to &s;eparate that part which related to the per|formance of full Mu&s;ic, and to publi&s;h the whole together afterwards, under the title of <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on Mu&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and am proud to embrace this opportunity of acknowledging the generous coun|tenance which tho&s;e gentlemen of integrity and genius &s;hewed it. <HI>So far,</HI> our critic has wi&s;ely conjectured, it was the work of a <HI>Junto.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="182">
But to &s;peak of the E&s;&s;ay it&s;elf. The plan it was formed upon was of a &s;ingular kind. It had nothing to do with the the|oretic principles, and the mere mechani&s;m of the &s;cience. Its aim was widely dif|ferent. Intended, indeed, as a critical, but yet as a liberal, examen of this plea&s;ing art; according to rules, not drawn from the formal &s;chools of &s;y&s;tematical pro|fe&s;&s;ors, but from the &s;chool of nature and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily perceive, that to the execution of &s;uch a plan, nothing was ne|ce&s;&s;ary but a good ear, and a ta&s;te culti|vated by frequent hearing of Mu&s;ic. It was only writing on harmony, as many men, who never handled a pencil, have written upon colouring; and as many, who never penned a &s;tanza, have writ|ten upon metre<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The ABB&Eacute; DU BOS, whom the remarker has deigned to quote, on a matter that required &s;ome ta&s;te in Mu&s;ic, was unfortunately of this &s;pecies of writers. Hear his character from VOLTAIRE's <HI>Siecle de Louis</HI> XIV. <Q REND="inline">"Tous les Arti&s;tes li&s;ent avec fruit &s;es Reflexions &s;ur la Poe&s;ie, la Peinture, et la Mu&s;ique. <HI>Il ne &s;avoit</HI> pourtant <HI>pas la Mu&s;ique,</HI> il n'avoit jamais pu faire de vers, et n'avoit pas un Tableau. <HI>Mais il avoit beaucoup lu, vu, enten|du, &amp; reflechi.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>; and yet, in every age,
<PB N="177" REF="183">
writers of this cla&s;s may be found, who&s;e works are held in as high e&s;teem, as if they had been compo&s;ed by the mo&s;t able practical profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>To give an in&s;tance or two (if our critic will pardon the learning of it); there is not, nor perhaps ever was, a &s;ingle ver&s;e extant from the pen of LONGINUS; and yet his critical ta&s;te is as univer&s;ally allow|ed, as that of HORACE him&s;elf. Though ARISTOTLE may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled the fa|ther of critici&s;m, and true judgement in poetry, yet he certainly did not excel in greatne&s;s or beauty of imagination, and had but a &s;mall &s;hare of the poetical &s;pirit.</P>
<P>If then the genius of this &s;ort of cri|tici&s;m is univer&s;ally &s;uch, that, having ta&s;te, not practice, for its object, it is directed to <HI>improve</HI> the <HI>manner,</HI> not <HI>teach</HI> the <HI>mechani&s;m,</HI> of any &s;cience; I &s;ee no rea&s;on why a critical enquirer into the merits of my e&s;&s;ay, &s;hould think it
<PB N="178" REF="184">
his bu&s;ine&s;s fir&s;t to examine the merits of my mu&s;ical compo&s;itions. Admit|ting tho&s;e compo&s;itions to be as bad as our Doctor would make them, I am then but in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e writers whom Mr <HI>Pope</HI> &s;omewhere mentions:
<Q><L>"Rules for good ver&s;e, they fir&s;t with pains recite;</L>
<L>"Then &s;hew us what is bad by what they write."</L></Q></P>
<P>But Mr <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;aid in another place,
<Q><L>"Let &s;uch teach others who them&s;elves excel,</L>
<L>"And cen&s;ure freely who have written well."</L></Q></P>
<P>This our &s;age remarker looked upon as an univer&s;al axiom, that would &s;erve his purpo&s;e excellently, and accordingly planted it in his title-page, &s;uppo&s;ing that the poet thought none had a right to critici&s;e, but &s;uch as were acknowledged to be good writers; whereas, he meant by it only, that critici&s;m, from an allowed arti&s;t, came with additional force and lu&s;tre; and &s;o undoubtedly it does. Yet,
<PB N="179" REF="185">
to do my author ju&s;tice, he pre&s;ently runs from his text him&s;elf; for, in the very 4th page, he is of opinion, that a per&s;on would be be&s;t qualified to write upon this &s;ubject, who had not only <HI>not written well,</HI> but who had not <HI>written at all,</HI> pro|vided only, that this per&s;on was a man of fortune, like his friend Sir <HI>Humphrey Da&s;h.</HI> If you a&s;k the rea&s;on, he will tell you, <Q REND="inline">"that to be &s;ure Sir Humphrey's large e&s;tate would give a &s;anction, and perhaps command a deference to his opinion."</Q> A very gentlemanly re|flection truly!</P>
<P>But why mu&s;t this rich Sir <HI>Humphrey</HI> be the only licen&s;ed critic? And why mu&s;t a profe&s;&s;or, <HI>though even of the bighe&s;t rank,</HI> not be admitted? No, he will reply, by no means; <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e, in &s;ome re&s;pect or other, the world will think him in|tere&s;ted in it; and will very ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded, that whatever degree of e&s;|teem his <HI>works</HI> or <HI>abilities</HI> may &s;tand in their opinion, yet, that in his own, they are placed much higher."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="186">
Thus, it is evident, that his &s;ole ob|jection lay again&s;t the author of the e&s;&s;ay, and not the e&s;&s;ay it&s;elf; and had I not &s;et my name to it, it is more than probable the public would not have been favoured with his curious remarks; and, for this rea&s;on chiefly, he has been in&s;ti|gated to level all his &s;pleen again&s;t my character, as a compo&s;er: nor has he thought it &s;ufficient to <HI>vilify</HI> the work he has <HI>given me,</HI> but he mu&s;t <HI>rob</HI> me of <HI>that</HI> which he could not hope to <HI>vilify.</HI> An unparalleled favour indeed! and, no doubt, per&s;onally intended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a malevolence among &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors of the harmonic art, from which no di&s;tance of time or country can &s;ecure even the mo&s;t de&s;erving in their own profe&s;&s;ion. Their contemporaries they treat as rivals to their intere&s;t; and the works and cha+racters of tho&s;e that are gone before, they con&s;ider as ob&s;tructions to their fame.</P>
<P>We cannot otherwi&s;e account for that wilful igno|rance, or affectation in &s;ome ma&s;ters, who have been weak, or rather envious enough, to propagate a ridiculous notion, that CORELLI was indebted to another compo&s;er for the &s;etting of his ba&s;&s;es. Can any thing be imagined &s;o ab&s;urd as this &s;uppo&s;ition? For the nature and method of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition is well known to be &s;uch, that, whoever this ex|traordinary coadjutor of CORELLI may have been, the&s;e &s;hallow defamers might have &s;pread their fal|&s;ities much more con&s;i&s;tently, had they attributed the con&s;truction of the whole to this wondrous unknown.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="187">
I think I have already reduced my antagoni&s;t's method of proceeding, to its fir&s;t principles, <HI>viz.</HI> to per&s;onal pique and re&s;entment; and have &s;hewn, that had he &s;ucceeded in his malevolent attempt;&mdash;had he proved my compo&s;itions as execra|ble as <HI>&s;ome</HI> that have echoed through univer&s;ity theatres; had he done even this, it would &s;carce have affected the character of my e&s;&s;ay.</P>

<P>There are many irregular &s;ubjects which may often be introduced into mu|&s;ical compo&s;itions; and, when any of the&s;e are <HI>imitated,</HI> or <HI>rever&s;ed,</HI> a good ear will a&s;certain their <HI>proper an&s;wers,</HI> beyond any rules whatever: for the principles of harmony, which particularly direct the method of an&s;wering a complete and re|gular &s;ubject, would carry the an&s;wers of many others, of a &s;ubordinate kind, into an extraneous modulation. Therefore, &s;uch &s;ubjects ought only to be imitated; and the di&s;tances, in this ca&s;e, are no otherwi&s;e to be con&s;idered, than as they may be&s;t agree with the <HI>mode,</HI> or <HI>key,</HI> in which they are employed, or that which is next to follow; neither is it nece&s;&s;ary that their <HI>intervals</HI> &s;hould be confined to

<P>The other authority I &s;hall bring from Mr RAMEAU's <HI>Principles of Compo&s;ition,</HI> on the &s;ubject of de&s;ign, imitation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"De&s;ign, in Mu&s;ic, is, in general, the &s;ubject of all that the compo&s;er pro|po&s;es; for a &s;kilful compo&s;er is to pro|po&s;e to him&s;elf, a movement, a key, or mode, a melody, and an harmony, agreeable to the &s;ubject he would treat.
<PB N="186" REF="192">
But this term is to be more particu|larly adapted to a certain melody, which he would have predominant in the con|tinuance of a piece, either for making it &s;uitable and agreeable to the &s;en&s;e of the words, or for fancy or ta&s;te; and, in that ca&s;e, it is di&s;tingui&s;hed in de|&s;ign, in imitation, and in fugue.</P>
<P>"Imitation hath no particular merit that de&s;erves our attention; it con&s;i&s;t|ing only by repeating, at plea&s;ure, and in any of the parts, a certain continu|ance of melody, <HI>without any other regularity.</HI></P>
<P>"Fugue, as well as imitation, con&s;i&s;ts in a certain continuance of melody, which may be repeated at plea&s;ure, and in any of the parts, <HI>but with more cir|cum&s;pection,</HI> according to the following rules.</P>
<P>"If, in imitation, we may repeat the melody of one or more bars, and even the air entirely in one, or in all the parts, <HI>and upon whatever chords we think proper;</HI> on the contrary, in
<PB N="187" REF="193">
fugues, the melody mu&s;t alternatively be heard in the two principal parts, which are the treble and the ba&s;s, un|le&s;s, in&s;tead of the treble we chu&s;e another part; and, if the piece contains many parts, it will be more perfect, when the fugue is heard alternatively in each part. Again, <HI>the chords that mu&s;t be therein u&s;ed, do not depend upon our choice</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rameau's</HI> Principles of Compo&s;ition, p. 147.</NOTE>."</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus much may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that all our critic's depth of learning, on the &s;ubject of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, mu&s;t be of ancient date only, &s;ince the great|e&s;t of the moderns, both in <HI>practice</HI> and <HI>theory,</HI> have rendered quite ob&s;olete many of tho&s;e rigid laws, which only fetter the genius of tho&s;e who would truly embelli&s;h their art.</P>
<P>By depriving the compo&s;er of the liberty of changing, or diver&s;ifying his &s;ubject, his piece, with frequent repetitions of the very &s;ame thought, would be extremely languid and tedious: whereas, if he re|lieves
<PB N="188" REF="194">
his fir&s;t &s;ubject with others, and the&s;e are relative to their principal, in point of <HI>air;</HI> and, with regard to their <HI>imita|tions,</HI> are chiefly conducted by the rules of <HI>modulation;</HI> an allegro of this kind will have infinitely more &s;pirit and variety, than either the lifele&s;s <HI>counterpoint,</HI> or un|meaning <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of throwing the air into one part only. What the compo&s;er hath chiefly to ob&s;erve in this conduct betwixt the extremes, is, a &s;pecial regard to the chu&s;ing tho&s;e &s;ubjects only, which may naturally be connected, as well in their <HI>modulation</HI> as <HI>harmony,</HI> and are capable of pre&s;erving a &s;imilar air (or di&s;cour&s;e, if the critic will admit) to the conclu&s;ion of his piece.</P>
<P>This method of introducing <HI>the acci|dental &s;ubjects,</HI> in a mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, may be handled like the like under-cha|racters in a dramatic performance; which, though the poet intends not that they &s;hould ever eclip&s;e his heroe, or principal, he will neverthele&s;s make natural and &s;triking; and it often happens, that
<PB N="189" REF="195">
though they are nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of his fable, they do but ju&s;t appear, and no more is heard of them.</P>
<P>It is frequent, with the be&s;t compo&s;ers of church-mu&s;ic, to introduce a new &s;ub|ject at every change of the words. An attempt of this nature, in the in&s;trumental way, has given our critic much offence; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, he has con&s;idered as too bold an innovation upon the good old laws of harmony: or did he think it an in|croachment on the privilege of vocal Mu&s;ic, and that no other &s;hould pre&s;ume to aim at &s;en&s;e, or the expre&s;&s;ion of any affection of the mind?</P>
<P>In his reflections, on the method of in|troducing the tenor, he makes a &s;trange pother about Mu&s;ic in four parts; when, in fact, there is no &s;uch thing. The <HI>di&s;|cords,</HI> it is true, will admit of four parts; but, as the ear cannot re&s;t on the&s;e alone, therefore, in every compo&s;ition, they mu&s;t have their <HI>preparations</HI> and <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> by <HI>concords,</HI> which, on that account, will have the greate&s;t &s;hare in the con&s;truction
<PB N="190" REF="196">
of the harmony; otherwi&s;e, it cannot be called Mu&s;ic: hence then, as it is impo&s;|&s;ible to find any <HI>concord,</HI> that can admit of more than three different notes; &s;o, &s;trictly &s;peaking, there can be but three parts in any mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, &s;ince whatever number may be added to the&s;e, they are no more than either <HI>uni&s;ons</HI> or <HI>octaves</HI> to their principals.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, by way of information to my critic, that notwith&s;tanding a piece of Mu&s;ic is com|po&s;ed in four parts, yet it does not follow that every <HI>chord,</HI> or every <HI>accented part</HI> of the harmony, &s;hould, therefore, have <HI>four notes,</HI> or even <HI>three</HI> in many ca&s;es. This kind of fullne&s;s is not always required, becau&s;e it often happens, that the <HI>tenor,</HI> or any other <HI>part,</HI> being either an <HI>octave</HI> or <HI>uni&s;on</HI> with the <HI>ba&s;s,</HI> or with <HI>each other,</HI> will produce a more plea&s;ing effect than when <HI>otherwi&s;e accompanied.</HI></P>
<P>On this &s;core, however, our critic has ar|raigned the ta&s;te of MARCELLO, as forming his <HI>choru&s;es</HI> upon the uni&s;ons of the <HI>&s;olo,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="197">
or <HI>principal parts;</HI> and thence prefers, on all occa&s;ions, the harmonical compo&s;itions of <HI>four parts;</HI> not reflecting on tho&s;e rea|&s;ons which the &s;en&s;ible compo&s;er may a&s;&s;ign for exerting his genius in <HI>either</HI> of the&s;e methods; and which MARCELLO very happily has di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the pro|digious variety of movements that are in the work of his P&s;alms. But this pur|blind critic, though he owns his intimacy with them all, could only &s;ee tho&s;e which he thought he might abu&s;e, and abu&s;e merely becau&s;e they were contrary to his groveling ta&s;te.</P>
<P>What offers next, is the wonderful &s;tre&s;s he has laid on &s;ome trifling di&s;allowances:&mdash;a mean kind of critique on the art of Mu&s;ic; as the&s;e are errors which may e&s;cape the mo&s;t painful corrections, and may be found in the works of the mo&s;t accurate compo&s;ers. I had almo&s;t &s;aid, it is more than probable our critic may find them in his own.

It were, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible to retaliate his friendly advice, by any minute &s;urvey of &s;uch unmeaning attempts in compo&s;i|tion.

<P>In return for this mortification, it &s;eems as if he had vowed revenge, and had de|termined not to allow me, even the very fir&s;t principles of thorough ba&s;s.

This BLITHMAN, perceiving that he had a natural geny to the faculty, &s;pared neither time nor labour to advance it to the utmo&s;t.

BULL, thereupon, de|&s;iring the u&s;e of ink and ruled paper, (&s;uch as we call mu&s;ical paper) prayed the mu&s;ician to lock him up in the &s;aid &s;chool for 2 or 3 hours; which being done, not without great di&s;dain by the mu&s;ician, BULL, in that time, or le&s;s, added <HI>forty more parts</HI> to the &s;aid <HI>le&s;&s;on</HI> or <HI>&s;ong.</HI> The mu&s;ician, thereupon, being called in, he viewed it, tried it, and re-tried it.

Neverthele&s;s, the fame of the&s;e great mu&s;ical deeds hath lived in the records of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us;</HI> and, no doubt but our critic, by his vicinity to that happy man&s;ion, hath already in view, the di&s;tant eminence of being enrolled among tho&s;e chiefs who have done &s;uch wonders.</NOTE>.</P>

throne in this ideal kingdom, I very re&s;pectfully take my leave of him.&mdash;But, in a &s;entence or two more, I will beg leave to deliver my &s;entiments of Mr. HANDEL, which, I am &s;ure, will contradict nothing I have &s;aid in my E&s;&s;ay; and, I flatter my&s;elf, will be a&s;&s;ented to by the <HI>rational</HI> part of our mu&s;ical judges.</P>
<P>Mr. HANDEL is, in Mu&s;ic, what his own DRYDEN was in poetry; nervous, exalted, and harmonious; but voluminous, and, con&s;equently, not always correct. Their abilities equal to every thing; their execution frequently inferior. Born with genius capable of <HI>&s;oaring the bolde&s;t flights;</HI> they have &s;ometimes, to &s;uit the vitiated ta&s;te of the age they lived in, <HI>de&s;cended to the lowe&s;t.</HI> Yet, as both their excellencies are infinitely more numerous than their deficiencies, &s;o both their characters will devolve to late&s;t po&s;terity, not as models of perfec|tion, yet glorious examples of tho&s;e

<P>I Shall here give the remark of a friend.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"You have &s;poken of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> p. 177. as of one who did not hold an eminent rank among&s;t the &s;ons of <HI>Apollo,</HI> but played a &s;ort of <HI>&s;econd repieno</HI> in that <HI>concert.</HI> I am &s;omewhat afraid, le&s;t you &s;hould offend certain <HI>Academics,</HI> who, upon this occa&s;ion, may let fly at you a &s;yllogi&s;m in <HI>Barbara,</HI> or <HI>Bocardo,</HI> and attack you with <HI>authorities.</HI> I would therefore advi&s;e you to add, that <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> repre&s;ent <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> as one of the mo&s;t ingenious, elegant, and polite writers; which affords a fa|vourable pre&s;umption, that his ver&s;es cannot be bad; and yet, on the other hand, who more eloquent than <HI>Cicero,</HI> who&s;e ver&s;es are certainly of the fa|mily of the <HI>Mediocres?</HI> It is al&s;o to be
<PB N="220" REF="232">
ob&s;erved, that this philo&s;opher exerci&s;ed his talents in the poetic way, com|po&s;ed a <HI>&s;cholium,</HI> or hymn, &s;ome di&s;|tichs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is commended, as a good poet, by <HI>Julius Scaliger, Daniel Hein&s;ius,</HI> and <HI>Rapin.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e critics went &s;o far as to affirm, that he was in no re&s;pect inferior to <HI>Pindar.</HI> But for thir partial determination of <HI>Scaliger,</HI> when he went to the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> fields,
<Q><L>"<HI>The Lyrics all again&s;t him ro&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>And</HI> Pindar <HI>pull'd him by the no&s;e.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>"Let us then rather be favourable, than &s;evere in our judgement upon this great genius, and leave his <HI>poetical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> ambiguous, till they be decided by your <HI>antagoni&s;t,</HI> when he &s;hall find him&s;elf able and willing to &s;ettle this <HI>counter-point</HI> and to di&s;cu&s;s the <HI>pro</HI> and the <HI>con.</HI>"</P></Q></P>
<P>You may thus read, in p. 177.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> father of critici&s;m and true judge|ment

in poetry, and though he was him|&s;elf a compo&s;er of ver&s;es, yet he holds not the &s;ame rank among&s;t the poets as among&s;t the critics.</P>
