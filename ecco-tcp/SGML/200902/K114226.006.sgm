<HEAD>THE HISTORY of BENIGNUS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="117" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE driver, con&s;idering us as &s;o many riotous young blades a little too joyous, had a mind to hu|mour our frolick; and &s;o rattled over the pavement to our hearts content. For, it is very well known, one of the greate&s;t raptures of <HI>rakei&s;m,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in making the hor&s;es draw their car|riage
<PB N="2" REF="9">rapidly through a town; and the more noi&s;e they make, the more clatter occa&s;ioned by the wheels, and the nearer they can go to a po&s;t, or a pa&s;&s;enger, without touching, the greater reputation they acquire from tho&s;e who under&s;tand coachman&s;hip, and the more like puppies, or mad|men they look in the eyes of tho&s;e grave per&s;ons, who want ta&s;te, or (as the&s;e young gentlemen more elegantly term it) <HI>&s;punk,</HI> for &s;uch exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>With the advantage of all this eclat, we arrived at the Common, and were introduced not only to Mr. Blake's pretty villa, but to Mr. Blake's pretty hou&s;e-keeper, as he called her; and, to do her ju&s;tice, as fine a woman &s;he was, in point of per&s;on, as ever adorned a hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">I was &s;ober enough to di&s;cern the indelicacy of Blake's carrying us be|fore a lady, in the pickle we then were; and indeed this became more glaring, before we had been half an hour in her company; for Green had &s;o inebriated him&s;elf with the Champaigne, and the violent joys at|tending it, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to re|move him into a le&s;s elegant apart|ment, where he might once more try the re&s;torative virtues of &s;leep; and Mr. Smack, who&s;e eyes worked in his head like a whirligig, propo&s;ed a walk in the garden, as the mo&s;t &s;alu&mdash;tif&mdash; er&mdash;a&mdash;riou&s;ly thing in the world, as the Po&mdash;et &s;ays, in the&s;e ca&s;es. While Mrs. Blake (for &s;o &s;he was &s;ometimes called, though much oftner hou&s;e|keeper Kitty) prepared the tea, Mr.
<PB N="4" REF="11">Blake (who appeared to be a dull, obliging, hard-drinking man) con|ducted us into his garden, which really exhibited in&s;initely more ta&s;te, than I imagined belonged to the pro|prietor; yet now, the choice of his garden, and the choice of his wife, much more indeed than the choice of his companions, rai&s;ed him very con|&s;iderably in my opinion. Mr. Smack, dizzy as he was, was in an extacy, and &s;aid that he was then in his element.</P>
<P>I congratulated Mr. Blake, on a re&s;idence at once &s;o plea&s;ing and &s;o contiguous to the metropolis. It is an agreeable &s;pot, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, replied Blake, and it is rendered more &s;o, by being my own property, and yet there is a material objection&mdash;
<PB N="5" REF="12">an objection that &s;ometimes keeps me away from it whole months, in the middle of &s;ummer: do you &s;ee <HI>that</HI> hou&s;e immediately oppo&s;ite to me? If that hou&s;e had been placed in any other part of the univer&s;e, I might have been happy; but as that is not the ca&s;e, drunk or &s;ober, I look at it with indignation. Why &s;o, &s;aid I, &s;urely it is rather a decoration, than a di&s;grace: methinks the &s;cene would want &s;omething without it.</P>
<P>Now, I think, re&s;umed Blake, it is a mo&s;t abominable eye-&s;ore, and I cannot bear to look upon it: It is the habitation of a fellow, without either heart or &s;oul, who hath done me the ba&s;e&s;t injury, and whom I would not &s;ave from the tortures of the rack, if it were to be done without
<PB N="6" REF="13">inconvenience or expence! cur&s;ed be the moment in which he purcha&s;ed that villa&mdash;he bought it&mdash;yes Benig|nus, the ra&s;cal bought it, on purpo&s;e to overlook me, and turn my poor little retreat into a &s;eat of torment.</P>
<P>Here the agonies of a violent an|tipathy encrea&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t upon him, that his hou&s;ekeeper, who overheard him, and knew his humour, de&s;ired Mr. Smack to per&s;uade him in, to tea.</P>
<P>This unaccountable execration per|fectly petrified me, and I was fairly &s;obered by &s;urprize: God protect us! (&s;aid I, in one of <HI>my</HI> whi&s;pers) what very poor creatures we are! here is a man now, placed by thy indulgence in a perfect Eden, hath the love and &s;ociety of a fair, and no doubt,
<PB N="7" REF="14">amiable companion; &s;eems to com|mand all the real pro&s;perities of life, even to a degree of luxury; and yet, torn to pieces by a hateful pa&s;&s;ion, even aver&s;ion to his neighbour, might as well have been placed by thy de&s;tiny in a dungeon, into which the ble&s;&s;ed beams of thy animating &s;un never penetrated, nor any of his pre|&s;ent comforts be permitted to vi&s;it him&mdash;! not forgive! triumph in ma|lice! cheri&s;h implacability! one fel|low-creature, &s;et his heart propen&s;ely again&s;t another! &s;ie upon it. Ah wherefore am I thus perpetually upon the hunt to examine and promote felicity? How <HI>&s;hall,</HI> how <HI>can</HI> it be promoted, when tho&s;e whom Provi|dence have &s;o peculiarly favoured, re&s;olve to be at once impious, and,
<PB N="8" REF="15">what indeed I begin to feel is the con&s;equence of impiety, to be wretched?</P>
<P>Mr. Blake's fit of &s;pleen was &s;oon over, and he drank his tea with that dull compo&s;ure which was character|i&s;tic of him, except when, as in the late in&s;tance, his pa&s;&s;ions were worked upon, by any immediate object of their dete&s;tation. His hou&s;e-keeper appeared very agreeable at the tea|table, and &s;ave that, now and then a word dropt from her, not quite &s;o feminine, &s;uch as, <HI>con&s;ume</HI> it, <HI>con|found</HI> it, <HI>pax rat</HI> it, and the <HI>dee'l</HI> (meaning the devil abbreviated) &s;he &s;u&s;tained her&s;elf va&s;tly well. To me &s;he was particularly civil, and a&s;ked me the common edifying que&s;tions of the tea-table, &s;uch as whether my cup
<PB N="9" REF="16">was &s;weet or not, &amp;c. &amp;c. with &s;uch a &s;mile upon her face, that had not Blake been pre&s;ent, her own heart engaged, and the object &s;miled <HI>upon,</HI> more of a coxcomb than Benignus, it certainly might have been inter|preted into a &s;ort of an overture: for the language of &s;miles, is really very intelligible to a keen ob&s;erver, and they often mark the &s;entiment of the &s;oul &s;o obviou&s;ly and di&s;tinctly, that he mu&s;t be a novice indeed who mi&s;takes them. However, I took it for granted this fair hou&s;e-keeper was in truth Blake's wife, and &s;o her &s;mile pa&s;&s;ed off, as the courte&s;y of a mighty good-natured woman; who, finding her hu&s;band not in a very entertaining humour, thought it in|cumbent upon <HI>her</HI> to make the vi&s;it
<PB N="10" REF="17">as plea&s;ing to her gue&s;ts as po&s;&s;ible. A brimming ba&s;on of tea was &s;ent to Mr. Green, who, &s;oon after drinking it, made his appearance again in the parlour; and Mr. Smack ob&s;erving that the &s;un was down, &s;aid he mu&s;t take his leave: a motion which I readily &s;econded. Blake urged us to &s;tay &s;upper, or at lea&s;t in&s;i&s;ted that now I had been &s;hewed the way, I would come often to Kennington; Aye, do &s;ir, &s;aid Mrs. Blake, and when he is not at home, <HI>I</HI> will do my be&s;t to de&s;erve the favour of your com|pany, &s;o name the day.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t was accompanied by another of tho&s;e &s;miles, that made it irre&s;i&s;tible; and I promi&s;ed to wait upon them on the next Sunday: this &s;atisfied them: Mr. Green took me
<PB N="11" REF="18">a&s;ide under pretence of doing a little bu&s;ine&s;s for him in town, and bid, me, half blind as he was, not, at any time to go to Blake's without <HI>him,</HI> Alexander Green; and then, declaring that I was a lad of a thou&s;and, &s;uf|fered me to depart.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Smack, and I walked lei&s;urely to town, and what is &s;trange, without an adventure: Smack, indeed, fre|quently made a pau&s;e again&s;t the pales of a garden, and told me, that he was very certain the owners ought to think them&s;elves thrice happy, as the poet &s;ays; though once, continued he, <HI>once</HI> Benignus, I knew a man,
<PB N="12" REF="19">a Mr. Budbright (that had the fine&s;t garden in all Kent) as wretched a mortal as ever was born: this Mr. Budbright was a profe&s;&s;ed flori&s;t: if his tulips were more prettily &s;treaked this year than the la&s;t he was happy, but then, if he &s;aw in any other man's garden, a finer tulip than he could &s;hew in his, he would be taken &s;ick upon it directly: Lord, how have I heard him cur&s;e the weather! the &s;un for being too hot, the &s;hade for being too cool, the hail for pattering down a pink, the rain for drowning <HI>this</HI> flower, the heat for drying up <HI>that:</HI> why I remember, I was once at his hou&s;e on a very fine day, which tempted him to uncover &s;everal little nur&s;eries of <HI>xoticks</HI> as the poet &s;ays, and he was ju&s;t going to di&s;play the
<PB N="13" REF="20">beauty of the&s;e to me, when a dark cloud made him take to his legs (and knock down one of his children, as it &s;tood in the way) that he might cover his precious plants, before they re|ceived any injury from the wet. But who can manage the fates, as the poet has it? The &s;hower fell very heavy on the &s;udden, before he got to the plants, and this put Budbright into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, that he quarrelled with his wife all dinner-time, and made my vi&s;it &s;o di&s;agreeable, that I left him to his humours, as &s;oon as I decently could: for though I love flowers, Mr. Benignus, I love the God that made them &s;till better, and I don't in the lea&s;t doubt but he knows better than I (though I am a tolerable judge to be &s;ure) when to <HI>keep</HI> the
<PB N="14" REF="21">&s;hower, and when to let it fall upon the tender <HI>yerb,</HI> as the Poet &s;ays.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Smack, that I perfectly agreed with him as to the knowledge of Providence, and a&s;ked him, what opinion he had of his friends Blake, and Green, as the Poet &s;ays? The lea&s;t is &s;aid the &s;ooner is it mended, replied Smack: they are two merry men, and I now and then am <HI>treated</HI> by both of them very civilly. But what think you, &s;aid I, of Mrs. Blake? Why as to Mrs. Blake, &s;aid Smack, &s;hutting one eye&mdash;the lea&s;t is &s;aid, the &s;ooner is it mended <HI>there</HI> too &mdash;as to Mrs. Blake, I think &s;he is&mdash;a &mdash;very merry woman.</P>
<P>As it was evident Mr. Smack had &s;ome rea&s;ons for &s;peaking &s;o re&s;erv|edly, po&s;&s;ibly becau&s;e he was now and
<PB N="15" REF="22">then <HI>treated</HI> civilly, I had not curio&s;ity enough to fi&s;h for intelligence, where the prey was prepared to expect a hook under the bait, and &s;o, finding we had by this time got pretty far into town, I called a coach, wi&s;hed Mr. Smack a good evening, as the poet has it, and then made the be&s;t of my way to Mr. Draper's.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="119" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Poor, &s;aid I, as I rolled along, poor and ineffectual are the plea&s;ures of di&s;&s;ipation. I went out in the morn|ing with an aching heart, and I come home in the evening with an aching head. Nor is the heart much lighter than it was: I have pa&s;&s;ed, or rather
<PB N="16" REF="23">thrown away many hours, like a wretched &s;troller as I am, in &s;earch of a benefit, I have not yet found; and the <HI>vanity</HI> that led me to hope relief from the gaieties of giddy com|pany, have produced little more than additional <HI>vexation!</HI></P>
<P>As I approached Dover-&s;treet, my heart began to beat more bri&s;kly; and as I &s;aw the door of Draper, I trem|bled from top to bottom. Upon going in I a&s;ked for Mr. Draper, and was told by his valet that &s;everal letters were for me, upon the library table, and among&s;t others one from his ma&s;ter, who was not to be at home till the next day. I hurried up &s;tairs the fa&s;ter for this intelligence, and &s;hutting the library door ap|proached the table. No le&s;s than four
<PB N="17" REF="24">letters were waiting my peru&s;al, and three of them in the &s;ame character&mdash; a character I did not even look upon without emotion: the other was a billet from my friend Draper, which, in flat oppo&s;ition to the impul&s;es of my heart, I was re&s;olved to read fir&s;t. I here give a copy of it to the reader.</P>
<P>"<HI>Draper</HI> is well, and happy, but the le&s;s &s;o, as an indi&s;pen&s;ible circum&s;tance (that &s;hall not long be concealed) will detain him to night, and perhaps to|morrow, from the company of Be|nignus."</P>
<P>This card without date, &amp;c. &s;ent by a porter who was to &s;tay for no an&s;wer, puzzled me: however, as my thoughts were too partially en|gaged another way, I left the unrid|dling
<PB N="18" REF="25">of it to him&s;elf, who was in|deed pretty enigmatical in his <HI>own</HI> conduct, and character. And now came on the moment of trial: the others were evidently from Lucy, and every one of them bore the marks of a hand and heart di&s;turbed, even in the folding and &s;ealing: I debated whether I &s;hould read them, or de&s;|troy them unread. I put them into my pocket, and twi&s;ting my arms, into a kind of philo&s;ophical fold, traver&s;ed the room. Yes, &s;aid I I am equal even to this, to read is to ruin: I will repre&s;s the fatal curio&s;ity. Yet &s;urely there can be no harm in hearing what &s;he &s;ays&mdash;perhaps &s;he has good-naturedly taken leave of me &mdash;perhaps &s;he applauds my de&s;ign&mdash; perhaps &s;he may want &s;ome little
<PB N="19" REF="26">additional accommodation, &mdash; per|haps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;</P>
<P>Here I drew one of the letters again out of my pocket, and fum|bling at the wax (even as I had again begun a meditation on the danger of it) had broken it gradually open, and held it up to my face, half unfolded. I &s;aw the tender epithet of "mo&s;t dear Benignus," at the top, and had the courage to &s;hut my eyes, then pre&s;&s;ing it gently up, buttoned it into my bo&s;om, and &s;at down in a chair.</P>
<P>And art thou grown <HI>inhuman</HI> Be|nignus, &s;aid I? Not read the letter of thy Lucy! Art not thou enough ma&s;ter of thy&s;elf, to per&s;evere in the rigid plan thou ha&s;t laid down as the rule of thy future conduct, but thou &s;u&s;pecte&s;t thy relap&s;ing even on
<PB N="20" REF="27">the receipt of a letter: put more con|fidence in thy&s;elf: thou art &s;tronger than thou thinke&s;t!</P>
<P>This mode of rea&s;oning &s;oon re|conciled me to the matter in hand, and I believe I &s;hould have been able (with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;educing pa&s;&s;ions, that were now in arms) to argue my&s;elf into the propriety of &s;hooting a bolt, or picking a lock. I took another letter from my pocket, and unfolded it with a violence that tore the paper. You have, worthy reader, a fair copy of the contents underneath.</P>

Here the paper dropt from my trembling hand; I &s;truck that hand upon my heart, and the heart obe|dient to the blow, brought the tears of remor&s;e and agony into my eye. As &s;oon as words found their way, I exclaimed in a reprobating tone of voice&mdash;a ba&s;tard! and have I, after all my benevolence, all my affected delicacy been in&s;trumental to the life of a Being that mu&s;t pa&s;s its days in &s;hame, ridicule, and ignominy&mdash;and yet&mdash;&s;hall the poor parent &s;uffer for this&mdash;&s;hall the weary and painful hours of the woman in travail, be made more bitter by the neglect of the very man who hath brought on her growing calamity&mdash;ah no! forbid it humanity, forbid it nature. It would now be impious to leave her.
<PB N="27" REF="34">I will go this moment&mdash;perhaps even now &s;he&mdash;even now&mdash;</P>
<P>I put the letters into my pocket, and went expeditiou&s;ly down &s;tairs, the clock &s;triking ten as I reached the la&s;t &s;tep. I &s;hall &s;leep out to night Crimpa, &s;aid I; and went into the &s;treet, without thinking of my &s;upper.</P>

<P>I continued ab&s;olutely to run, till I arrived at the lodgings of Lucy, which I no &s;ooner entered, than the bewitching creature ran to me, and gave me &s;uch a ki&s;s of welcome as completely did for me. In the dining|room was &s;itting, even at that time
<PB N="28" REF="35">of the night, an ill-looking but well|dre&s;&s;ed elderly woman: Lucy met me on the &s;tairs, and telling me &s;he had been very ill all day, and very lone|&s;ome, had been obliged to an old country acquaintance to &s;it a little with her, but you may go now Mrs. Trickmaid, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall be very well now my dear Benignus is come. The old Lady curte&s;ied ceremoniou&s;ly, and paraded down &s;tairs with great pomp; and, not thinking her worth a que&s;tion, or rather not having time to a&s;k <HI>unintere&s;ting</HI> que&s;tions, I had a tongue only for Lucy, whom I treated with much greater tender|ne&s;s than ever. And are you not angry with me Benignus, &s;aid &s;he, for the additional expence I am likely to bring upon you, or are you now
<PB N="29" REF="36">come to take leave of me for ever? However, be that as it may, the hap|pine&s;s of this night &s;hall not be made wor&s;e than it <HI>ought</HI> to be, by painful anticipation. Saying this, &s;he took me in her arms, dropt her head, as if unable to &s;upport it, upon my bo&s;om, and&mdash;we did not &s;leep in &s;eparate chambers.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, the &s;ervant came into the bed room, to inform Lucy, that the jeweller was come again. Hang the fellow, &s;aid Lucy, for di&s;turbing us, what &s;hall we &s;ay to him, Benignus&mdash;&s;ay, my dear, replied I, pay him this moment to be &s;ure, and I a&s;k your pardon that I &s;hould have forgotten to inclo&s;e a &s;ufficient bill for the purpo&s;e; but the di&s;order I was in ye&s;terday morning will ex|cu&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="37">it to you. Nay, &s;aid Lucy, I am now very indifferent as to &s;uch mat|ters: I have got you again Benignus, and no other jewel upon earth can add to the lu&s;tre of my pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>The well-timed tenderne&s;s of this &s;peech, would have made me pay with pride and plea&s;ure, a bill of larger amount than the pre&s;ent: although the earings were no trifles in point of price neither, bearing no le&s;s a valuation than 200 guineas. Upon talking with the trader, I could not help &s;aying it appeared to me a mo&s;t mon&s;trous price for &s;o &s;mall a trinket.</P>
<P>The &s;maller the more elegant, my dear, &s;aid Lucy, but I think as well as you, Mr. Knicknack might abate &s;omething.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38">Abate, madam, &s;aid Knicknack&mdash; not a &s;ixpence&mdash;I don't get a guinea by them, and I would not &s;ell them &s;o cheap to any body el&s;e, in the world&mdash;but as you are likely to be a cu&s;tomer, why&mdash;I won't &s;tand with you, and therefore I have been at a word. But won't you have the neck|lace along with them Madam? It is a thou&s;and pities to part them. They are for all the world like brother and &s;i&s;ter, or rather like man and wife, and &s;o pray madam let them go to|gether&mdash;oh fie&mdash;how can you wear the earings without the necklace: 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, is it not &s;ir?</P>
<P>Don't tell me &s;aid Lucy, I am &s;orry to put the gentleman to the charge of the earings, and I will give you
<PB N="32" REF="39">ten guineas out of my own pocket, to take them again.</P>
<P>I was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this generous conduct of Lucy's, that I was re&s;olved to reward it: and, pray Mr. Knicknack &s;aid I, what would be the charge of this necklace? I can afford it to <HI>you</HI> &s;ir, at two hundred more, and I would not &s;ell it &s;o dog cheap to my own father.</P>
<P>Poor Lucy had &s;uffered &s;o much upon my account on the ye&s;terday, and had given &s;uch manife&s;t tokens of a good di&s;po&s;ition, that I e'en de|&s;ired (to u&s;e the jeweller's phra&s;e) this <HI>brilliant couple,</HI> might be &s;trictly united; and gave him a draft upon Mr. Par&s;ons of Chancery-lane, for the &s;um of four hundred guineas. Lucy
<PB N="33" REF="40">took me again into her arms, and &s;aid, that I had now made her happy <HI>beyond expre&s;&s;ion!</HI></P>

<P>I thought my&s;elf &s;o bound to Lucy by the ties of nature, at lea&s;t till the birth of the child, and pro|vi&s;ion of the mother, that in&s;tead of finding more arguments <HI>again&s;t,</HI> I did every thing to favour tho&s;e ideas, which &s;ugge&s;ted the contrary; and as to the guilt of the connexion, I thought of that as little as po&s;&s;ible: indeed, the fact was, I had not the confidence to give way to reflections of that &s;ort, le&s;t I &s;hould be tempted a &s;econd time to de&s;ert the now preg|nant
<PB N="34" REF="41">Lucy. Nay, I will fairly own to the reader, even at the hazard of &s;inking in his e&s;timation, that I had two or three &s;evere conflicts with my&s;elf, whether, as an hone&s;t man, notwith&s;tanding the loo&s;e life of Lucy, I ought not, before the birth of the babe, to &s;anctify, as it were, its ap|pearance in this world by a lawful acknowledgement of Lucy as my wife. Whom, &s;aid I, whom have I to fear, but the terrors of my own con&s;cience? Whom have I to plea&s;e, but my own heart, and the good God that gave it?</P>
<P>By an act of indubitable equity, it is now in my power to render ho|nourable, the life of that creature I have begotten, which will otherwi&s;e be &s;pent in di&s;grace: the mother too,
<PB N="35" REF="42">has been indi&s;creet, but is young in error, and may, by being led into the purer path, walk in it the re&s;idue of her days, with delicacy, with dignity, and proper attention to the double duties of wife and parent. What hinders me then from yielding to &s;uch benevolence? Why &s;hould I he|&s;itate to do that, which is thus urged by the approbation of rea&s;on, and ju&s;tice? I know not indeed as yet any of Lucy's family; I know not from whom &s;he &s;prang, by whom &s;he was ruined, nor to whom &s;he is related. Hitherto I have con&s;idered her as the object of dalliance; and I was al&s;o cautious of entering into &s;ubjects that might heighten my perplexity: but the ca&s;e is now altered; &s;he has cer|tainly been con&s;tant to me, and the
<PB N="36" REF="43"><HI>effect</HI> of that con&s;tancy is, unle&s;s I pro|vide again&s;t it, likely to be her greate&s;t misfortune. Were I to &s;uffer this, I &s;hould be a di&s;courager of fidelity, and an enemy to that ten|derne&s;s which is the very cement of continued and progre&s;&s;ive &s;ociety.</P>
<P>On the other hand I argued, what many a man no doubt in &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances has argued before me, that &s;uch a union would &s;ubject me to the ridicule of all my friends, and the ab&s;olute de&s;ertion of all my rela|tions: that it would particularly pique the pride of the Darlingtons, and that even Draper's negative would be flat again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, and what of all this? &s;hall the fooli&s;h cen&s;ure of a world, led in the triumphant &s;hackles of
<PB N="37" REF="44">cu&s;tom, browbeat me from a point I <HI>feel</HI> to be &s;o very con&s;i&s;tent with what is right? I thank heaven neither &s;y&s;|tems, nor adventures, nor the con|tradictory &s;entiments they have ex|hibited to me, have as yet, had any weight with me to alter the great duty I fir&s;t cheri&s;hed of "doing to others, as I would they &s;hould do unto me;" and, in poor Lucy's cir|cum&s;tances, I am &s;ure the duty to be done is too apparent to be ne|glected: nay, it comes recommended to me under the mo&s;t touching and pathetic incidents: methinks I hear the helple&s;s little infant plead its own tender cau&s;e: imagination a&s;&s;i&s;ts me even to per&s;onify the &s;cene. See, &s;ee the unfriended Being be&s;eeches me to own it&mdash;the father is &s;upplicated to
<PB N="38" REF="45">acknowledge his own child&mdash;the mo|ther too, prevented by delicacy from making the reque&s;t, looks up to me for protection, points out to me the features that mo&s;t re&s;emble the parent, ki&s;&s;es the beloved &s;imilitude, and only ventures to ob&s;erve in a whi&s;per, that had it been born in wedlock, it might one day become a joy to the wife, an ornament to the father, and a credit to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>And were the&s;e arguments made to be re&s;i&s;ted, were &s;uch advocates ever &s;uffered to plead in vain? Avert it nature; avert it all that is godlike in the compo&s;ition of man.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the whole matter was this: I will certainly have &s;ome very &s;erious conver&s;ation with Lucy on this &s;ubject, and if I find her as
<PB N="39" REF="46">de&s;erving in other re&s;pects, as I know her to be in &s;ome, I will overlook the circum&s;tance of her fir&s;t misfortune, and make her, in &s;pite of all the op|po&s;ing world, neither more nor le&s;s, than the lawful wife of Benignus.</P>

<P>Let the Reader &s;ay what he plea&s;es, the very center of my heart was cheared by this re&s;olution, and pro|mi&s;ing Lucy I would dine with her, I took my morning-walk with a &s;atis|faction to which, till then, I had been a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>And now I paid my &s;econd vi&s;it to the unfortunate wife of the Grocer, in conformity to my intention. I
<PB N="40" REF="47">found Mrs. Brawn at the place ap|pointed, and gave her five guineas, with a de&s;ire that &s;he &s;hould get her|&s;elf decently equipped, and in a com|fortable lodging; and then told her I had a &s;cheme in view that I hoped would make her once more happy; that is, &s;aid I, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that you would not oppo&s;e any thing that might have a tendency to bring you and your hu&s;band together again. Mrs. Brawn was &s;o elevated at the &s;ight of the money, that &s;he promi&s;ed any thing, though it is probable &s;he &s;carce knew to what &s;he a&s;&s;ented. She would go, &s;he &s;aid, and do as I bid her directly, and hoped God would ble&s;s every &s;tep I took from this would to the next. In a few days then, Mrs. Brawn, added I, you
<PB N="41" REF="48">will give me a call, agreeable to a di|rection; and I now gave her one of Draper's printed cards, containing his addre&s;s; which Mrs. Brawn, wrapt up in a piece of paper, and put in her bo&s;om. Having taken notice that her handerchief was clean, her cap new, and her apron fre&s;h wa&s;hed &s;ince I &s;aw her the day before. I told her that I perceived my la&s;t money was well be&s;towed&mdash;that I &s;aw &s;he was &s;till a hou&s;ewife, and that &s;he gave me encouragement, from the&s;e pro|&s;pects, to continue my a&s;&s;i&s;tance while it &s;hould be wanted: which, &s;aid I, both for your &s;ake and your hu&s;band's (who is, no doubt, by this time &s;orry for his imprudence) will not be long.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="49">From Mrs. Brawn, I took a &s;trole into Dover-&s;treet, to &s;ee if any fre&s;h me&s;&s;ages had arrived from the ab&s;ent Draper.

<P>That Mr. Green could pre&s;erve the &s;ame equality of temper&mdash;or rather, that he could &s;o &s;oon accommodate him&s;elf to the &s;udden rever&s;es of fortune was a&s;toni&s;hing; the more e&s;pecially, that he could be calm enough to talk about happine&s;s with|out &s;ix-pence in his pocket: yet I mu&s;t own I was exceedingly &s;truck with the direction and recommen|datory letter he had given me to Mr. Lemuel Dab, whom, as I had two or
<PB N="46" REF="53">three hours upon my hands before dinner, I was re&s;olved to vi&s;it upon the mere principles of curio&s;ity. With|out more delay then, I began (for the fir&s;t time in my life) my journey into St. Giles's, where, after infinite diffi|culty, I found out the dark pa&s;&s;age that led me to Mr. Peper's, the land|lord of Mr. Lemuel.</P>
<P>The coachman had no &s;ooner opened the door, than a difficulty aro&s;e; for lo! I had not a &s;ingle &s;ix-pence in my pocket, having &s;ent the very la&s;t run|ning ca&s;h I had to Green. The fare was only a &s;hilling, and yet that was twelve pence more than I could com|mand. I told the driver very fairly my &s;ituation, and added, if he would call on me where he took me up, to-morro morning, I would double his pay. As to that ma&s;ter, &s;aid the coachman,
<PB N="47" REF="54">I don't know you, nor do you know me; &s;o I think the be&s;t way would be not to tru&s;t one another: be&s;ides, many gentlemen come out of great hou&s;es that never get admittance into them again; and yet, very few gen|tlemen come out of &s;uch a hou&s;e as that, where I took your honour up, and come to &s;uch a d&mdash;m&mdash;d up-and|down place as this: and though I don't &s;uppo&s;e this to be your honour's ca&s;e, &s;eeing that you are very well dre&s;&s;ed, yet I doubt if your honour can't pay me <HI>one</HI> &s;hilling to day, it may not be quite &s;o convenient to pay <HI>two</HI> to-morrow: moreover, &s;ir, it is but a good twelve penny-worth, and to be &s;ure the friend you are going to <HI>&s;ee,</HI> can lend your honour &s;uch a trifle.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">Od'&s;o, &s;aid I, that's true friend; I'll &s;tep up to the gentleman, and borrow the value of your debt; &s;tand to your hor&s;es therefore, and I'll be with you in a minute. This trouble, however, the coachman was too polite to put me to, rather choo&s;ing, like a well|bred man that knew his bu&s;ine&s;s, to attend me clo&s;ely, till we had no farther to do with one another. Af|ter pa&s;&s;ing through many &s;trange la|byrinths, even before we a&s;certained the tenement, and then climbing a flight of &s;tairs at once broken and dirty, we came to a dark little door, on which was pa&s;ted a paper label, with the words, "Lemuel Dab." thereon. As I knocked for admit|tance, the coachman looked at me, as much as to &s;ignify his &s;u&s;picions, that
<PB N="49" REF="56">out of <HI>that</HI> hou&s;e would come no &s;hillings. I took it for granted, and told him by way of reply, that he <HI>might</HI> &s;tare, but that whatever he might think of it, the happie&s;t man in England lived in that hut, notwith|&s;tanding his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>By this time, the lord of the man|&s;ion opened the door, and demanded our bu&s;ine&s;s. I delivered my te&s;ti|monials, and while he was reading them, I recollected in his features, the marks of the <HI>very</HI> Lemuel, whom I had already &s;een at the &s;hop of Mr. Luton the book&s;eller, with who&s;e ingenious method of dealing with his authors, the reader is pre acquainted.</P>
<P>Mr. Lemuel Dab now offered his hand with great tokens of ho&s;pitality, and invited me into his apartments:
<PB N="50" REF="57">but here the coachman again in&s;i&s;ted upon <HI>his</HI> &s;hare of attention. Without more ado, I told Lemuel my embarra&s;&s;|ment, and the aukward &s;tate of my <HI>uvelle</HI> perplexity; concluding with de|&s;iring the loan of a &s;hilling. I have but <HI>three halfpence,</HI> &s;ir, &s;aid Lemuel, or you &s;hould have it joyfully, but what of that? The&s;e trifles are &s;ettled in&s;tantly. What have you got about you of value? I took out of my pocket a tweezer-ca&s;e, which very luckily hap|pened to be of &s;ilver, an opera gla&s;s, and a pocket-book with &s;ilver cla&s;ps. Why, &s;ir, cried Lemuel, you carry the Indies about you, and can you po&s;&s;i|bly be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed about a &s;hilling? Sit down three minutes, and I will ac|commodate you.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58">Lemuel took the tweezer-ca&s;e, and went out, while the coachman and I remained in his lucubratory, which, in point of exterior, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed every thing but the lucubrator.</P>
<P>Sweet heaven, &s;aid I, what a variety of minds ha&s;t thou created: &s;ome peo|ple would &s;hudder to be only in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of three halfpence, while an|other accounts it &s;ufficient to his fe|licity. But with how little ceremony does this man &s;et off to fell my pro|perty. If he is not the happie&s;t man, he has the happie&s;t way of doing an unaccountable thing I ever knew &s;ince I was born: but the tweezer-ca&s;e is a bauble, and &s;o let it go; be&s;ides, I have no other way of getting rid of this fellow, and 'tis all very well.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">The&s;e cogitations were interrupted by the return of Lemuel, who put into my hand the value of half a guinea in &s;ilver, and a little &s;lip of pa&s;teboard, written upon, and notched at the edges,&mdash;<HI>that</HI> &s;aid Lemuel you'll put into your pocket-book, and &s;o the bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;ettled. I gave the man his &s;hilling and an additional &s;ix|pence for waiting, which he took without pulling off his hat, or pre|tending to thank me, and went &s;neer|ing down &s;tairs.</P>

<P>Mr. Lemuel and I, &s;oon entered into familiar conver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which I gave him, at his
<PB N="53" REF="60">reque&s;t, a partial &s;ketch of my ad|ventures, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing what I thought would not tell to my advantage: and at the conclu&s;ion I a&s;ked him, whether he thought any of the ways I had pur&s;ued, or &s;een, were the ways to Happine&s;s?</P>
<P>The way to Happine&s;s? Why how can'&s;t thou be &s;o prepo&s;terous? &s;aid Lemuel. The road is as plain as a pike &s;taff. Your adventures are diver|&s;ified and agreeable, without being u&s;eful, and they prove to me but one &s;ingle truth.</P>
<P>And what is that? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>That all thy faculties, rejoined the philo&s;opher, were given thee only to torment thee: that curio&s;ity is the bowl, and &s;en&s;ibility the dagger by which thou art de&s;troyed&mdash;that every
<PB N="54" REF="61">&s;en&s;ible property about thee, touch, ta&s;te, &s;ight, &s;mell, and every thing el&s;e, organic, animal, and homun|cular, is of no more u&s;e to thee than the freckles upon thy chin, or the mole upon thy cheek-bone! and that, in one &s;entence, thou art altogether the mo&s;t unaccountable biped that ever &s;napt at thy own &s;hadow, and mi&s;took the real rea&s;ons for which the &s;ub&s;tance was created. Reduce happine&s;s into a <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> indeed! reduce the many-coloured clouds into a nut&s;hell! what the pe&s;tilence is the matter with thee? Always complain|ing of ill treatment, and going about the world to complain of matters that are mighty well as they are! I am glad however, that by means of my friend Mr. Green, you are come
<PB N="55" REF="62">in my way. I will take compa&s;&s;ion on thy inexperience, and it &s;hall be thy own fault if thou art ever un|happy again, let what will befall thee &mdash;&s;it &s;till&mdash;attend.</P>
<P>In the gratitude of my &s;oul, I put up a &s;ilent ejaculation, and made my|&s;elf certain that my hour was now really come, and that I &s;hould pa&s;s the re&s;t of my life in &s;miles.</P>
<P>Our three-halfpenny philo&s;opher, caught up his pen with a gravity of mu&s;cles that portended &s;omething extraordinary, then, giving a my&s;tical flouri&s;h with his elbow, waving it &s;emicircularly, he wrote upon a &s;mall piece of blotted copy-paper the fol|lowing words in large &s;crambling capitals.</P>
<Q><PB N="56" REF="63">THE ART OF BEING ALWAYS HAPPY.</Q>
<P>Now for it, &s;aid I, throbbing with expectation! the ceremony is &s;o aweful, that I dare &s;ay the &s;y&s;tem or precept to which it leads, is &s;olid and infallible: there is an air of divination in the very po&s;ture of the penman as he now &s;its, &s;welling over the maje&s;ty of his &s;ubject. I would not interrupt him for the univer&s;e.</P>

<P>After two or three minutes parade, he wrote under this promi&s;ing title, one pithy period, in which the rules of Horace were &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erved,
<PB N="57" REF="64">that it con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix words, which he wrote in a Roman text hand thus,
<Q><HI>Take Things as You Find Them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here he laid down his pen, pointed with his finger to the maxim, and looked me full in the face; at la&s;t he addre&s;&s;ed me thus, What think you now &s;ir, eh? Have not I done your bu&s;ine&s;s completely?</P>
<P>Pray go on, dear friend, &s;aid I ha&s;tily, pray go on. Go on rejoined Lemuel, knitting his brows: aye, I thought &s;o: I knew you would be at that &s;port! Why, where the pe&s;ti|lence would you have me go to? No, &s;ir, I &s;hall go no farther; I <HI>can</HI> go no farther. The great nicety to be ob|&s;erved in every thing human is this,
<PB N="58" REF="65">
KNOW WHEN TO STOP. Why I have done man, totally done: engrave it in letters of adamant&mdash;en|grave it on a plate of gold, &s;urrounded by gems of precious price, and let it be hung by a &s;ilver chain around thy neck.</P>
<P>Engrave <HI>what,</HI> Mr. Lemuel? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>What? replied he; oh blindne&s;s! why the golden rule I have given thee: there it is, the greate&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, and the mo&s;t whole&s;ome &s;y&s;tem upon the face of the earth.
<Q><HI>Take Things as You Find Them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Preach to eternity you can prove no more: un&s;ettle by &s;y&s;tems and long-laboured literary roundabouts, the very marrow in the hollow of your bones, you can come no clo&s;er to the ultimatum of all things de|firable,
<PB N="59" REF="66"><HI>that</HI> you may depend upon. Only ob&s;erve this rule, and if it does not bring you through, even as it brought <HI>me</HI> through, why my name is not Lemuel Dab. Why, &s;ir, I found my &s;y&s;tem on a ba&s;is of bra&s;s, even upon the fundamentals of 40 years ex|perience, and if I were to la&s;t 400 years longer, which I &s;carcely &s;hall, it would remain the &s;ame infallible axiom. Well do I remember the time, when, made petulant by pro&s;perity, and &s;oftened by a wor&s;e, becau&s;e a <HI>higher</HI> &s;ituation than that in which you now find me; rendered peevi&s;h and effeminate I &s;ay, by the&s;e things, I u&s;ed to quarrel with every thing around me, that did not hit my hu|mour to a tittle. I gave the &s;lack rein to my pa&s;&s;ions, and they hurried me
<PB N="60" REF="67">into many &s;orry &s;crapes that only made me more wayward. When I was angry I made no &s;cruple to knock down a table, a chair, a gla&s;s, or a flower pot, if it &s;tood in my way. I fell out, even with the&s;e inanimate objects. I could not eat, if my din|ner had the turn of the &s;pit too much, or too little, without cur&s;ing the cook. I could not drink, if my beer ta&s;ted too much or too little of the hop without damning the brewer. I &s;aw, or fancied I &s;aw imperfections in every thing, but God took pity on me, &s;ir, and deprived me of what is called my pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, in order to open the eyes of my perverted un|de&s;tanding: a few good, &s;ub&s;tantial &s;trokes upon the heart cooled me wonderfully&mdash;the lo&s;s of an e&s;tate to
<PB N="61" REF="68">which I was born (that fell a prey to the lawyers) &s;ettled me perfectly; and a little ob&s;ervation upon the af|fairs of men, a&s;&s;ured me, that I might kick, and prance, and give my&s;elf airs, but it would all be to no purpo&s;e: that I &s;hould only live anxious, and go down into the grave &s;ooner, for acting the &s;elf-tormentor; and tearing my body and con&s;titution all to pieces: &s;o, in progre&s;s of my practi&s;ing the&s;e wi&s;er &s;entiments, I found my&s;elf gradually better and better able to go through the twenty-four hours, let what will happen in them, without acting either like a &s;toic or a madman: I &s;till <HI>felt,</HI> but I found it now and then politic, not to <HI>&s;hew</HI> that I did &s;o: I was obliged to live by dealing in a commodity few know to value,
<PB N="62" REF="69">and &s;till fewer choo&s;e to purcha&s;e, even by retailing out the few wits that the Lord had lent me.

</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>This Mr. Lemuel, was really &s;o prejudicing a figure, that even his darling rule of, "taking things as we find them," could &s;carce reconcile one to him. From top to toe, he was &s;o uniformly uncouth, that &s;o far from its being po&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider any <HI>peculiar</HI> oddity, he was all over a compound of mo&s;t ridiculous nature.
<PB N="66" REF="73">The &s;calp of his &s;kull was totally bald, &s;o that he was, as it were, all face from his chin forward, to the nape of his neck backward; and yet he affected to de&s;pi&s;e a wig. But what made this the more prepo&s;terous, was the grote&s;que <HI>&s;hape</HI> of his &s;cull, which, tapering away pyramidically from the ear, formed at the top a complete cone, not very unlike one of tho&s;e chee&s;es, known by the name of the Stilton chee&s;e. Under an im|men&s;e depth of &s;ocket, lay encaverned our philo&s;opher's eyes, overhung by &s;uch a profu&s;ion of brow, that Nature &s;eemed to have made a &s;mall mi&s;take, in &s;uffering the hair to cover the face, in&s;tead of the head; for, had it been her divine plea&s;ure to thin the eye-brow, in order to accommodate
<PB N="67" REF="74">the pate, both might have been be|comingly furni&s;hed: but, certainly her Lady&s;hip was in her merrie&s;t mood, at the birth of this her ludi|crous Lemuel: for be&s;ides the&s;e &s;in|gularities, the na&s;al organ obtruded upon the oral; a pair of raw-looking lips, always on the gape, and twi&s;ted awry, exhibited a pair of jaws that, had not the chin by curling upwards, mode&s;ty aimed at concealing the aby&s;s, it might not be &s;afe for women in certain &s;ituations, to look upon them.</P>
<P>Such was the appearance which was now &s;talking into the &s;treet; and let me hope pardon for the decent pride of human nature, if I fairly con|fe&s;s I was &s;omewhat a&s;hamed of my companion; for, what was concealed,
<PB N="68" REF="75">or but "darkly vi&s;ible" in the attic &s;tory, in which the man and the man&s;ion were of a piece; now they came to be &s;eparated, and our philo|&s;opher &s;et his face to the &s;un, I began to fear the fate of king Richard would be again realized, and the very dogs bark as Mr. Lemuel "halted by them." Sober rea&s;ons ju&s;tified the&s;e &s;u&s;picions; for his habiliments, were of &s;uch a cut and &s;uch a colour; the thing that he wore by way of hat, &s;o uncommonly ab&s;urd; &s;o thin his carca&s;e, to which was &s;ubjoined &s;uch an emaciated thigh, and &s;uch longi|tude of leg, over which were drawn &s;uch harlequin ho&s;e, that he was al|together a moveable wonder. Yet, feeling a mixt &s;en&s;ation of pity and &s;urprize, as I &s;aw him, like a dark
<PB N="69" REF="76">&s;hadow, lengthen before me, I had the courage to keep within a yard of him in the public &s;treets of this laughter-loving London.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity, however, threw her eyes upon him in a moment, and we were attended by a great multitude. As I knew not the place where Lemuel was accu&s;tomed to enjoy his <HI>two-penny,</HI> he took the lead; and after turning through namele&s;s dark pa&s;&s;ages, and dirty alleys, amid the hoot of boys, the giggle of girls, and the &s;ilent a&s;|toni&s;hment of full-grown people; Lemuel, without &s;eeming to regard the &s;pectators that he had drawn around him, &s;topt at the door of a mi&s;erable building, which di&s;played at once the &s;lope of age, and bad architecture. From hence i&s;&s;ued a
<PB N="70" REF="77">&s;moke that a&s;cended to the no&s;trils, and Lemuel, telling me we were landed, ducked his head, to fix his foot upon the &s;teps; and then, taking hold of my hand, we both &s;unk, like a pair of theatrical go&s;ts, into a cellar.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, amazement had fixed her &s;eal on my lips; and <HI>now,</HI> had my exi&s;tence depended on a &s;yllable, it could not have been arti|culated. The fumigations of the place at my fir&s;t entrance into this infernal ordinary, not only blinded my eyes, but took away my breath; and I was ab&s;olutely inveloped in a mi&s;t of meat. Lemuel, on the con|trary, to whom the fog was familiar, &s;at collected in him&s;elf, and told me, with appetite in his very look, that we were in a land flowing with milk
<PB N="71" REF="78">and honey! even in the land of Canaan.</P>
<P>A <HI>flowing</HI> land, I'll be &s;worn &s;aid I, for we are up to the ancles in water. In <HI>broth,</HI> my dear lad you mean, &s;aid the philo&s;opher: a man of my prin|ciples, a man with any &s;ort of mode|ration about him might live and pro&s;per, upon what is here thrown away; we wade in marrow, and the richne&s;s of the bones, my be&s;t youth. We do <HI>indeed,</HI> replied I, and if we &s;tay much longer here, &s;hall I do verily believe wax exceeding fat; I am in a thriving way already Mr. Lemuel. P&s;haw, rejoined Lemuel, &s;it thee down upon this form, and let us con&s;ider, what <HI>dainty</HI> we &s;hall &s;ix on: the wor&s;t of it is, in the&s;e places one's appetite
<PB N="72" REF="79">is always di&s;tracted by &s;uch delicious variety.</P>
<P>I &s;at down, and as well as I was able, kept my&s;elf from bathing in the broth. And now, my &s;ight being in &s;ome degree re&s;tored, I had an op|portunity to &s;urvey the cellar, and its inhabitants! Never, &s;urely, did the human eye behold a more mi&s;cel|laneous heap of dead and living &s;ub|jects: on one &s;ide were di&s;played the quarters of an ox, the limbs of a lamb, and the entrails of a pig; raw and roa&s;ted, baked and boiled, ming|ling together. The cook in a grea&s;y night-cap, and his &s;hirt &s;tript and folded in a tru&s;s to his elbow, was &s;corching at the fire. On the other &s;ide &s;at a row of &s;habby cu&s;tomers in
<PB N="73" REF="80">&s;ilent expectation, and, to give a fini&s;h|ing to the whole, the window was blockaded by a parcel of poor crea|tures, who, unable to purcha&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance, were contenting them&s;elves with the &s;hadow, and actually dining upon the effluvia that came &s;teaming from the pots.</P>
<P>As I, by this time, had received a &s;urfeit, Lemuel had looked him&s;elf into longing. I'm for a &s;lice of that ham, &s;aid he, my friend: ham is a promoter of two-penny. In compli|ment to Lemuel, I attempted to eat: this ham is too fat, &s;aid I; the&s;e greens are too much like yellows, this bread is too &s;tale. Od's pe&s;ti|lence, cried the philo&s;opher, <HI>take things as you find them:</HI> come, do as I do, man. Impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I. Then read this,
<PB N="74" REF="81">cried the philo&s;opher, taking a little dirty manu&s;cript out of his pocket, and pre&s;enting it to me&mdash;read that, and I'll fini&s;h in a minute.</P>
<P>I opened the book, and read the title, which ran thus: "The E&s;&s;ence of Truth, or the Art of being Happy, at all Times, in all Places." Now for it, &s;aid I, friend Lemuel: if thou can&s;t prove it po&s;&s;ible, for a man to &s;it &s;tewing in a little, &s;ubterraneous cellar, and yet be cooly contented both in mind and body, thou art <HI>indeed</HI> a philo&s;opher. I do prove it, every day of my life, &s;aid the philo|&s;opher with the meat in his mouth: &s;hut the book, and behold ocular demon&s;tration. Look at that lattice; all things are comparative. The&s;e people would give their ears for the
<PB N="75" REF="82">&s;at and greens, at which you to&s;s up your no&s;e, Do&s;t thou think &s;o? replied I eagerly: I &s;hall &s;ave &s;ome pieces upon my plate, as I always do; and then you &s;hall &s;ee, rejoined Lemuel.</P>
<P>Here waiter, &s;aid I, give each of tho&s;e women at the window, &s;ix|penny worth of what they like be&s;t. Sixpenny-worth! cried the philo&s;opher in a loud voice, laying down his knife and fork in a&s;toni&s;hment: why man, there never was heard &s;uch a &s;peech here, &s;ince the foundations of the hou&s;e were laid; Lord, how little do&s;t thou know how to live: well may &s;o extravagant a man be mi&s;er|able; if the rich could conceive, <HI>how,</HI> many of the indigent, as they are fal&s;ely called, were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; they
<PB N="76" REF="83">would be taught, at the &s;ame time, more &s;en&s;ibility, and more oeconomy. As to this place, notwith&s;tanding the delicacies which &s;urround you, a penny is competent, three-halfpence, is giving a little into indulgence; three pence is intemperate &s;pending, and four-pence farthing is a down|right debauch.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations excited in me the very fir&s;t reflections on my <HI>own extravagance,</HI> and I was fully re&s;olved to be more oeconomical.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the philo&s;opher &s;aid, he would regale with the luxu|ries of a pipe, a&s;&s;erting, that it an|&s;wered two excellent purpo&s;es; fir&s;t, by promoting meditation; and &s;e|condly, by promoting dige&s;tion. I told him I was &s;ummoned by a par|ticular
<PB N="77" REF="84">engagement, which would at pre&s;ent deprive me of his company. He took hold of my hand, and with great compo&s;ure, bade me farewell. Re&s;erving only a &s;hilling, which I was wi&s;e enough to keep for acci|dents, I begged his acceptance of the remainder, leaving the fate of the poor people at the lattice, to his di&s;|cretion; then, promi&s;ing to repeat my vi&s;it, I took leave of this truly practi|cal philo&s;opher, and after many en|quiries, got out of the lanes into a main &s;treet, where, luckily &s;eeing a &s;tand of coaches, I made u&s;e of one to convey me once more to the apart|ments of Lucy.</P>

<P>How much more real happine&s;s appeared to re&s;ide in the cellar of the philo&s;opher, than in the lodgings of Lucy, at the time I arrived! the fir&s;t object I met at the foot of the &s;tairs, was Lucy's &s;ervant, arguing the point in &s;eeming earne&s;tne&s;s, with a &s;habby man, who was leaning again&s;t the banni&s;ters: the next groupe of figures were di&s;po&s;ed in the dining|room, in the following order; on the one hand was Lucy, who, upon per|ceiving me, bur&s;t into a violent flood of tears; oppo&s;ite to her was the very old woman, who ye&s;terday appeared as Lucy's friend; and at the other
<PB N="79" REF="86">end of the room, &s;at my worthy, and well-recollected acquaintance, Mr. Dodge: without more preface, the ca&s;e &s;tood thus. Lucy had, as &s;he &s;aid, previous to my connection with her, re&s;ided at the hou&s;e of this Mrs. Trickmaid, who, for board, lodging, and money lent, had run up a bill to the amount of 100 pounds, which &s;he was re&s;olved to have at a moment's warning; and, upon application, meeting an excu&s;e, had taken out a writ, and put it, for <HI>&s;erving,</HI> into the tru&s;ty hands of Mr. Dodge. Lucy took me into the bed-room, and told me, &s;he could not bear the thoughts of my paying any more; and that, with my leave, as &s;he would not live in the debt of &s;uch a ba&s;e woman, &s;he would &s;end her ear rings to be
<PB N="80" REF="87">pledged. I told her, it was a very unlucky affair, as I had lately drawn pretty deeply on Par&s;ons; but that I thought it my duty to pay it, if &s;he knew it to be a rea&s;onable demand.</P>
<P>The old woman &s;aid &s;he had &s;worn to the debt; and Mr. Dodge hoped I would pardon him for &s;erving his Maje&s;ty. Without teazing the reader with the di&s;agreeable particulars of this affair, I &s;hall ju&s;t inform him that it ended, in my paying debt and co&s;t, with &s;ending a &s;econd me&s;&s;enger to Mr. Archibald Par&s;ons. When the parties were gone, and Lucy and I left alone, &s;he told me, the &s;urprize and confu&s;ion of that cruel woman's unexpected behaviour was too much for her; and &s;he begged permi&s;&s;ion to lie down on the bed. Here, as I at|tended
<PB N="81" REF="88">her, &s;he &s;aid, in a whi&s;per, that the very babe within her was di&s;turbed; and &s;he would not hurt the dear pledge for ten thou&s;and worlds. This affected me &s;o much, I wept in the &s;incerity of my tender|ne&s;s, and quite forgot the expen&s;ive circum&s;tance of the old woman and her hundred pounds.</P>
<P>After dinner, I talked with Lucy upon &s;everal &s;ubjects, on purpo&s;e to &s;ound the depth of her judgment and under&s;tanding; both which were &s;o much beyond women in her &s;ad cir|cum&s;tances, that I was more and more convinced of her de&s;erving a &s;acred &s;ituation. In the cour&s;e of the afternoon, &s;he became very agreeable, and &s;hewed a good heart, by wi&s;hing with a &s;igh, that &s;he had
<PB N="82" REF="89">&s;een me, before &s;he had ever known guilt, but that (as it was) &s;he might die fir&s;t. Why <HI>&s;o,</HI> Lucy? &s;aid I. Be|cau&s;e <HI>then,</HI> Benignus, &s;he replied, your child will not want a friend, and a protector in <HI>him,</HI> whom he will not be permitted to call father: one thing &s;he &s;aid, &s;at heavy upon her bo&s;om, but if I would grant one reque&s;t, it would be infinitely relieved; it is only that you will allow me to turn all my trinkets into money, and place it in the Bank, for the u&s;e of <HI>our</HI> in|fant, le&s;t after you have left me, it &s;hould be de&s;titute; and after &s;uch a mea&s;ure, no wants or temptations could prevail with me to touch it: nay, I will, with your leave, by a deed of &s;ettlement, put it out of my own power.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">Hearts of marble, or adamant only could &s;upport this; and in the glow of my feelings, I a&s;&s;ured her, a de|cent competency &s;hould very &s;hortly be made, by way of annuity, upon the mother of the infant; not, &s;aid I, Lucy, that I have any de&s;ign to leave you, but becau&s;e you &s;hould have a little comfortable dependence of your own, and be properly provided for, and &s;et above the nece&s;&s;ity of future improprieties, &s;hould any thing hap|pen to <HI>me.</HI> Lucy &s;aid, I was goodne&s;s it&s;elf, and intreated &s;he might with|draw to indulge the &s;en&s;ibility I had excited.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the per&s;on of this man, I &s;aw&mdash; whom do&s;t thou think, my good reader?&mdash;Even the grocer of Gra&s;&s;ing|ton, whom I no &s;ooner acco&s;ted, than he recognized me, and &s;pake thus. Ah&mdash;ha! my young hero, have I found you! you are a fine <HI>benevlent</HI> chap indeed, with a pax to ye; you <HI>kidnab</HI> people's children do you?
<PB N="86" REF="93"><HI>Gim me</HI> my daughter, damme, gim me my daughter: 'tis you have got her <HI>now</HI> I find, after &s;he was turned out of doors. This is your fine <HI>&s;arch</HI> after happine&s;s, is it!</P>
<P>I ha' come all the way from Gra&s;|&s;ington <HI>ater</HI> you; your name's pretty well <HI>up</HI> there, I can tell you that, ma&s;ter <HI>Nignus</HI> the <HI>'nevolent.</HI> Gimme my daughter I &s;ay, or I'll &s;end you over the herring-pond, take my word for't.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t that I &s;uppo&s;ed was, that the poor Grocer's misfortunes, in the lo&s;s of his wife and daughter, had turned the little wits he had, and that he was now, being in the middle of the moon, in the height of his de|lirium. I told him I knew nothing of his daughter, but believed I could
<PB N="87" REF="94">help him to his wife, if he wi&s;hed &s;uch a circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>My wife!&mdash;what ha&s;t got <HI>her</HI> too, ha&s;t? Do&s;t keep um <HI>both</HI> then&mdash;eh? I'll have thee hung, drawn, and quar|tered: thee may'&s;t talk of thy <HI>nevo|lence,</HI> and &s;uch like, but I'll not budge from thee the length of my nail, till ha&s;t given me my daughter: as to Martha, &s;he may &s;tay where &s;he is, I have almo&s;t lo&s;t all my &s;ub&s;tance for want of a woman to look &s;harp to &s;hop, and &s;o it can't be much wor&s;e with me; but <HI>thee</HI> &s;halt pay for all, ma&s;ter <HI>Nignus,</HI> I promi&s;e thee.</P>
<P>By this time a mob collected; it was in vain I prote&s;ted I knew no|thing of his daughter: though I owned I had rendered &s;ome little &s;er|vices to his poor de&s;titute wife. He
<PB N="88" REF="95">&s;wore he would fetch a warrant and <HI>&s;arch</HI> my hou&s;e, and &s;end both me, and his b&mdash;h of a daughter to Newgate before night: adding, that he was &s;ure the wench was now in my hou&s;e, and &s;o, &s;ays he, thee had&s;t better <HI>gee</HI> her up at once, for I tell thee again, and again, you <HI>nevolent</HI> &s;on of a w&mdash; I'll not leave thee.</P>
<P>As nothing would &s;atisfy him but a conviction that I was really inno|cent of the crime imputed to me, I e'en agreed to take him with me, fir&s;t to Lucy's, then to Draper's; and indeed I now began to con&s;ider the charge of too important a nature, both to <HI>my</HI> character, and the Grocer's peace of mind, not to clear my&s;elf. I &s;uffered the Grocer therefore, to waddle by the &s;ide of me, till I got
<PB N="89" REF="96">to the door of my mi&s;tre&s;s, which, being accidentally left open, the grocer ru&s;hed in, and I after him. Lucy's maid &s;eeing us, ran as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible up &s;tairs, without &s;peaking, to acquaint her mi&s;tre&s;s (as I then &s;up|po&s;ed) that a &s;tranger was coming. Mr. Brawn, now in a violent per&s;pi|ration, mounted the &s;tairs, and with|out knocking, broke open the door that the maid had ju&s;t &s;hut after her; which he had &s;o &s;ooner done, than he roared out, in a voice inconceiv|ably dreadfull. Did not I tell thee &s;o &mdash;eh? Did not I tell thee thou had&s;t got her? What do you &s;ay to <HI>this</HI> Mr. <HI>Nignus,</HI> the <HI>nevolent?</HI> And what do <HI>you</HI> &s;ay to it you fine dizend-out hu&s;&s;ey&mdash;eh? With your &s;ilks, and
<PB N="90" REF="97">tricks, and your <HI>trinkumbobs,</HI> and &s;uch like&mdash;eh?</P>
<P>The vehement &s;cream of Lucy, the confu&s;ion of the maid, and the lan|guage of Brawn, &s;oon convinced me, that I had really been all this time connected with the Grocer's de|bauched daughter; and yet the whole matter appeared to me &s;o like a dream, that I was as little able to an&s;wer, as to account for it. All that I was able to &s;ay, was to a&s;k what all this meant? What is it, replied the Grocer, why that you've made a w&mdash;of my daughter, or at lea&s;t you have <HI>harboured</HI> her, and that's enough for me. Nay, I can bring witne&s;s, that thee &s;aid&s;t thee had&s;t my <HI>wife,</HI> and I don't doubt but thou
<PB N="91" REF="98">ha&s;t made a w&mdash;of &s;he&mdash;mayhap, &s;he's in next room. I'm '<HI>&s;olved</HI> to &s;ee <HI>how&s;omdever.</HI></P>
<P>Here he made an effort to open the door of the bed-room, but was op|po&s;ed both by Lucy and the maid, each prote&s;ting nobody was there: but, as Brawn continued to per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olutions to &s;earch the whole apartment, I went my&s;elf to &s;econd him; and we met the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance from the women. A letter in the &s;cuffle, dropt out of Lucy's pocket, which, to prevent farther mi&s;|chief, imagining it to be one of mine, I took up; and the Grocer at la&s;t gained his point, at the &s;ame time gave Lucy a thru&s;t with his hand again&s;t the wain&s;coat, that brought her upon the carpet in a &s;woon.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99">Brawn now ran raving up and down the room, to&s;&s;ed about the bed cloths, &s;hook the curtains, examined the clo&s;ets, and was coming di&s;ap|pointed into the dining-room, when he bethought him&s;elf to look under the bed, where, lo! after &s;tooping down to the ta&s;k with great difficulty, he &s;aw, and pulled out by the left leg a &s;omething very like a man, that had upon its back a very glittering coat, and upon its belly, a &s;till more glittering wai&s;tcoat. Who art <HI>thee,</HI> eh? &s;aid the Grocer, turning him over; another <HI>nevolent</HI> chap I <HI>'&s;po&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, the figure aro&s;e, and convinced the whole company he was <HI>alive,</HI> though infinitely drunk. He &s;wore, as well as he was able to make out the matter, that <HI>that</HI> Lady was
<PB N="93" REF="100">his property, that he would not de&mdash; de&mdash;liver her to the Crim of Tar&mdash;tar, nor the Z&mdash;aar of Mu&s;covy, and that as he had already killed one man upon her account, he would kill two more, if&mdash;if they did not in&s;tantly quit the prem&mdash;i&mdash;&s;es.</P>
<P>This heroic re&s;olution was very near producing a battle, for our &s;tag|gering young gentlemen drew his &s;word, which was really &s;tained with blood, and waved it at the brea&s;t, fir&s;t of the Grocer and then me, while the Grocer flew to the fire place, and &s;eized the poker. It was no time for dallying, and I was, at the ri&s;que of my life, re&s;olved to quiet this &s;park; accordingly I &s;tole behind the chair, where he had by this time &s;eated him|&s;elf, got the &s;word from his gra&s;p,
<PB N="94" REF="101">and drawing him on the floor, ex|amined his pockets for <HI>that</HI> informa|tion, which he was him&s;elf, unable to give me <HI>verbally.</HI> Not a trace how|ever, remained to lead me: not a &s;ingle clue to this enigma, and all that either threats, or per&s;ua&s;ions could extort from either Lucy or her maid, were, that he was a drunken rake, who, &s;eeing the door open, had forced him&s;elf up &s;tairs, and could not be per&s;uaded to go away, till hearing us coming, the mi&s;tre&s;s had prevailed upon him to go through the bed|room down &s;tairs, as &s;oon as we were in the dining room.</P>
<P>Very true, as you &s;ay, fair Lady&mdash; very true.&mdash;I am but a dr&mdash;drun&mdash; drunken rake as you ob&s;erve; cried the man, and &s;o&mdash;gem&mdash;gentel&mdash;le|men
<PB N="95" REF="102">your humble &s;ervant, I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm &mdash;o&mdash;only a rake.</P>
<P>He got up, and reeling to the &s;tairs, fallied into the &s;treet. The mi&s;tery increa&s;ed; the puzzle was more in|tricate than ever. One thing <HI>how&s;om|dever</HI> is plain, &s;aid Brawn; this here is my daughter, my property, and I &s;eize her in the king's name. I'll have her home if its only to vex her; and as for thee ma&s;ter Nignus, I'll take care of thee, as &s;oon as I can talk to <HI>layer</HI> I promi&s;e thee. So come along mi&s;s.</P>
<P>He was proceeding to lay violent hands on her, when the landlady of the hou&s;e came up with a letter, which, &s;he &s;aid, was to be given into no hand but Mrs. Lucy Brawn's; I told the woman that brought it,
<PB N="96" REF="103">ma'am, there was no &s;uch per&s;on here, as you go by the name of Silborn. Silborn be d&mdash;d, &s;aid the Grocer; what do&s;t talk of Silborn? She was born and chri&s;tened Brawn, and &s;he is every inch a Brawn, and my <HI>brawn,</HI> I'll &s;wear to her; &s;o <HI>gee</HI> the letter to me, or el&s;e I'll &s;end ye to the herring-pond, for I'm her lawful father, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>The landlady delivered the letter, and very prudently retired; while my grief, indignation, and amazement, increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t upon me, that I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted. Brawn, having opened the letter, &s;wore it was writ|ten with &s;uch a d&mdash;d up and down fi&s;t, he could not <HI>cypher</HI> it, and threw it to me: but it &s;ignifies nothing talk|ing, I'll have <HI>laa,</HI> and my daughter; &s;o &s;aying, he caught Lucy by the arm,
<PB N="97" REF="104">and &s;he, falling upon her knees, a&s;ked pardon, and &s;aid, if he would be le&s;s violent, and come to-morrow, &s;he would <HI>tell</HI> every thing, and <HI>do</HI> every thing he would have her.</P>
<P>I did love thee once, Lucy&mdash;know&s;t I did&mdash;would have given the be&s;t at the Sugar-loaf to make thee happy: but now you are gone, and Martha is gone, and my &s;ub&s;tance is at <HI>rack</HI> and ruin, I don't know what to do, what to &s;ay, nor whither to betake me: why poor Bob Blewit is better off than I am now; lawyer Limbo's come back as rich as a Jew, and Bob's going to have all his <HI>fortin</HI> again, and they &s;ay will be riche&s;t man in county; but I, I luckee have nothing to hope now. Why &s;hould I get money? I love nobody. I can't find
<PB N="98" REF="105">my wife; I'm a&s;hamed of my daughter; and I an't &s;o fat as I was by &s;everal &s;tone; I am half melted with fretting.</P>
<P>The poor Grocer began to weep, and his whole &s;peech, together with the intelligence concerning Mr. Blewit, (who, by the by, returned my <HI>la&s;t</HI> pre&s;ent, with a grateful letter, in which he told me, his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances did not require a&s;&s;i&s;tance) all wrought upon me but too powerfully; and I did every thing my &s;en&s;ibility &s;ug|ge&s;ted, on &s;o trying an occa&s;ion, to ea&s;e the heart of this offended and afflicted father. I told him every cir|cum&s;tance that related to his wife, at who&s;e &s;ituation he forgot his u&s;ual ferocity, and cried like the child of <HI>nature,</HI> that gives way only to <HI>natural</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="106">impre&s;&s;ions. I promi&s;ed to bring about an interview. I a&s;&s;ured him that, with re&s;pect to his daughter, I had protected her for &s;ome time, from wor&s;e conditions; and that, while I lived, &s;he &s;hould never want a friend; nay, I even went &s;o far, as to promi&s;e him, if I did not make her my wife, I would never &s;ee her again in an im|proper way, though I would &s;uf|ficiently provide for her. The no|tion of making her my <HI>wife</HI> had won|derful weight with the Grocer, who took me by the hand, and &s;aid; you did not <HI>ruin</HI> &s;he, I know that, and &s;o can the ea&s;ier forgive: but I am now &s;o much the talk of Gra&s;&s;ington, and the Sugar-loaf is &s;o loan&s;ome, that I can't &s;moke, nor I can't go about, nor I can't bu&s;tle, nor I <HI>can't</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="107">do <HI>nothing;</HI> for what, after all, is a man's gettings, if he has neither wife nor daughter to &s;hare them? The&s;e remarks ended with his ki&s;&s;ing Lucy, and telling <HI>me,</HI> that the whole matter of my having his daughter, was di&s;|covered by one I little thought on, but that he would tell me all to-mor|row, and de&s;ired I would get Martha to &s;ee him, and that we might all have a meeting at the &s;ame hou&s;e in the morning. Upon my promi&s;ing this, he in&s;i&s;ted on Lucy's going with him to the inn where he &s;et up, and &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould come with him again in the morning. The poor girl dared not refu&s;e (&s;uch was her a&s;toni&s;hment) and <HI>I</HI> had not the courage to op|po&s;e it; &s;o off &s;he walked, in an agony of half-&s;tifled di&s;tre&s;s, with the Grocer.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="108">They were no &s;ooner gone, than I ma&s;tered my amazement &s;ufficiently, to recollect the <HI>letters,</HI> and read them with the a&s;toni&s;hment they com|manded. That, which had dropt from Lucy's pocket begins the next chapter.</P>

<P>Scarce had I read this letter, before the dead body of Draper came to the door, attended by the &s;urgeon, and another friend, who was pre&s;ent at the engagement. Words would wrong what pa&s;t within my mind at this &s;ight; and poor Benjamin was
<PB N="116" REF="123">only inferior to me in mi&s;ery, for|getting quite his joys with the new|married Nancy, the woman of his heart.</P>
<P>Three days did I hunt with a vigi|lance &s;carce to be equalled, after the murderer of my friend. Three days did I &s;earch every corner of the metropolis, for the abandoned L. L. who was palpably the wretch! and that very blood I &s;aw, was the blood of Draper, of Draper who fought and fell to vindicate the mo&s;t extravagant Benignus! I could not find him, I could not find the perpetrator of a deed that &s;hould have been paid for with his life or with mine.</P>
<P>On the fourth day it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give the remains of this noble youth to the du&s;t, and on that
<PB N="117" REF="124">evening were put into the grave the remains of the fine&s;t, true&s;t, and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed man in England.</P>
<P>He was buried in the tomb with his ance&s;tors, and when every attend|ant was gone, and all the people that flock round a pompous funeral were di&s;per&s;ed, I bribed the &s;exton and the clerk to give me the key of the church, where I pa&s;t the whole night upon the cold tomb of my poor Draper, and I half execrated the morning that tore me from him.</P>
<P>The next day elap&s;ed before I had a thought to be&s;tow on Lucy; yet let me not, &s;aid I, repay evil with evil: &s;ince I cannot find the villain that &s;educed her, and murdered Dra|per, let me not, like a vindictive &s;pi|rit, add to the mi&s;ery even of the

<P>Thus ended my intercour&s;e, and in this manner was di&s;&s;olved my con|nection with the perfidious Lucy, and her father; the wife was, I under|&s;tood &s;oon after, re&s;tored to the arms of her grea&s;y lord, who &s;et off with his family (after mi&s;repre&s;enting <HI>me</HI> to
<PB N="121" REF="128">all his friends) for Gra&s;&s;ington; where, however, their return was neither happy nor harmonious; for the mi&s;|fortunes of the wife, the daughter, and the hu&s;band were everla&s;ting fources of dome&s;tic reproach: while <HI>I</HI> was reprobated as the cur&s;ed cau&s;e of all the mi&s;chief; and the name and conduct of the blundering Benig|nus! ignominiou&s;ly circulated round the country, even till the &s;candal thereof reached my native village. The idea of the&s;e calamities, with the death of Draper, and the di&s;|plea&s;ure of Mrs. Darlington, drove me to the very verge of de&s;pair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXXXII.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;ome degree to bury, if po&s;&s;ible, the angui&s;h of my &s;oul in the whirl of worldly recreation, I yielded to intreaties, and (being a&s;hamed to meet the eye of Mrs. Darlington) paid a vi&s;it to Mr. Blake, who began to admini&s;ter the old, ineffec|tual cordials&mdash;&s;uch as, "we were all mortal; that we were here to-day, and gone to-morrow; that it was fooli&s;h to grieve for what could not be helped&mdash;&s;ooner or later we mu&s;t all follow Mr. Draper, and that if I was to fret my&s;elf to death, what was done could not be undone."</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="130">But all the&s;e &s;tale common-place maxims had no other effect upon me, than to make me de&s;pi&s;e the vulgarity by which they were dictated, and yet in the &s;ociety of this man, and his fair hou&s;e keeper, I &s;ometimes found a refuge, rather than give my&s;elf wholly up to the embraces of &s;olitude and &s;orrow. I made it however, a &s;olemn cu&s;tom (well &s;uited to the pre&s;ent gloomy habits of my life) to pay a nocturnal vi&s;it once in the week, to the tomb of the admirable Draper; or rather to the church|yard, near to which the remains of this beloved companion were inurned. &mdash;I was one night offering my devo|tions to the &s;hade of my friend, and walking pen&s;ively near to the porch of the church, "day being at odds
<PB N="124" REF="131">with morning," when I beheld two men, coming with &s;tealing &s;teps into the church-yard; and, after &s;ome little ceremony, they &s;at them&s;elves down by the &s;ide of a grave.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid I, poor creatures! they are doubtle&s;s upon an errand no le&s;s melancholy than mine. They are upon a vi&s;it to the new-made grave of &s;ome dear departed friend. Per|haps, two affectionate brothers, are mourning over the a&s;hes of a father&mdash; perhaps their tributary tears are de|voted to a friend in the du&s;t&mdash;perhaps a wife&mdash;a mother&mdash;or a &s;i&s;ter, much loved, and much lamented, is croud|ed into the narrow man&s;ion of mor|tality; or perhaps&mdash;</P>
<P>I was interrupted in the progre&s;s of the&s;e reflections, by perceiving
<PB N="125" REF="132">one of the men digging up the earth, as if with a &s;pade, while the other &s;till remained &s;itting as before. This excited my curio&s;ity, and, under favour of a very cloudy atmo&s;phere, I went &s;oftly along the yard, till I came near enough to ob&s;erve the event of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and yet, by the &s;helter of an oppo&s;ite tomb that was rai&s;ed of &s;tone in the center, I e&s;caped any danger of <HI>their</HI> ob&s;erva|tion. Such a conver&s;ation &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two men, as may very well be di&s;believed by tho&s;e who are happily ignorant of the arts of this wonderful metropolis; or who are not intimately conver&s;ant with the great truth that is couched in the trite &s;aying&mdash;one half of the people

<P>What do you mean by that? I'll take no &s;uch money, and &s;o you may tell doctor Ga&s;hman. I never buried a finer <HI>body</HI> in my life&mdash;be&s;ides he died of a &s;omething that none of the faculty could make any thing of. D&mdash;n it, Mr. Nabfle&s;h, you don't know what you are talking about. This man's <HI>inwards</HI> are worth a Jew's eye&mdash;I'll not &s;ell him for le&s;s to my father. So ava&s;t digging.</P>

<P>Looke, Mr. Sexton, you are too hard upon my ma&s;ter&mdash;he's a good

Did he not take off your hands, (or rather your <HI>ground</HI>) the author there who died in Grub-&s;treet, becau&s;e he would never move out of his room, and &s;o got a hurt in his <HI>&s;edantaries?</HI> Did he not purcha&s;e the body of the man (for whom the intere&s;t of his friends procured Chri&s;tian burial) who was hanged la&s;t Monday fortnight. And, if I had a mind, I could tell you a &s;ecret that would &s;top your avaricious mouth at once.</P>

<P>What's that, Mr. Nabfle&s;h?</P>

<P>Why the doctor is at this time attending a lady of your pari&s;h, who

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>&s;t. Man.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, Mr. Nabfle&s;h&mdash;dig away, and he's your man. I have thrown the mold over him as ligntly as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;o you'll &s;oon get at him. It's a fine night for the purpo&s;e of <HI>rai&s;ing our dead,</HI> and we &s;hall have done pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Upon this the purcha&s;er of in&s;ulted humanity proceeded, and &s;et his &s;pade into the earth with an air of deter|mination.
<PB N="129" REF="136">While he was thus em|ployed, the worthy &s;exton, whom, by his voice, I di&s;covered to be the very man that &s;old to me the key of the church, on the night of Mr. Draper's interment, amu&s;ed his co|partner with the characteri&s;tic remarks which follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. <HI>Man.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'm a thinking Mr. Nabfle&s;h, what a friend I have been to the faculty in the cour&s;e of my fexton&s;hip, and how much the di&s;&s;ectors, and anato|mi&s;ers are obliged to me; for this is, you mu&s;t know&mdash;this very &s;pot is the mo&s;t populous, and be&s;t inhabit|ed church-yard in chri&s;tendom. 'Tis amazing to think what a number of &s;ouls (<HI>bodies</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay) come through my hands every week, and as I am
<PB N="130" REF="137">very intimate with the pari&s;h apothe|cary, and make it moreover my bu|&s;ine&s;s to know a little how folks <HI>go off,</HI> I can tell which commodity to re|commend to my friends; for there are a &s;et of fellows who are not worth a re&s;urrection, and therefore God re&s;t 'em and rot 'em for us. Tho&s;e who die, as it were, a natural, vulgar death, in a feather-bed, are not worth a &s;ingle &s;ixpence, except indeed they die of a contagious di&s;temper, and &s;o bury in <HI>lead,</HI> and that you know turns to account. As to your <HI>wooden</HI> tene|ments, they put now-a-days &s;o little timber in 'em, and build them &s;o &s;lightly, that they won't make a kettle boil; and &s;carce pay for the trouble of turning the body out of them. 'Tis your <HI>unaccountable</HI> deaths
<PB N="131" REF="138">that make <HI>us live,</HI> ma&s;ter Nabfle&s;h: and between you and I, and the man we are rai&s;ing, I have a &s;hrewd gue&s;s our old <HI>rector</HI> will make a <HI>&s;ubject</HI> by and by. I don't know what the plague ails him, but he's certainly upon the <HI>go,</HI> and I have &s;ome rea&s;on to think Dr. Ga&s;hman has an eye upon him. All in good time how|ever; I have nothing to do with a man while he is upon the face of the earth; nor do I ever con&s;ider him as <HI>my</HI> property till I have got him under-ground.</P>
<P>By this time the dealer in the dead had pretty nearly fini&s;hed his work, and told the &s;exton that he felt his pick-axe &s;trike again&s;t the nails of the coffin. I've knocked at the door ma&s;ter &s;exton, &s;aid he, and I fancy
<PB N="132" REF="139">we may make our&s;elves pretty certain of finding the gentleman at home: I warrant ye now, he little expects to ri&s;e again <HI>&s;o &s;oon!</HI> though, to &s;ay the truth, we <HI>do</HI> come to make him take the air at an un&s;ea&s;onable hour. After all, Mr. Earthworm, what truly great men we are! We are, in the fulle&s;t manner, your workers of mira|cles: we cau&s;e the dead to ri&s;e, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our <HI>pharmaco|pelic</HI> friends, bid them live as it were again, and be in <HI>good &s;pirits:</HI> yea, verily, we command this mortal to quit its corruptible fle&s;h, and be hung forth in all the <HI>immortality</HI> of bone. O ma&s;ter Earthworm we are very &s;er|viceable members of &s;ociety indeed.</P>
</SP>
<P>A &s;econd pau&s;e was made in this curious dialogue, by the actual re|&s;urrection
<PB N="133" REF="140">of the coffin, which the&s;e gentlemen with peculiar dexterity &s;et upright; and one proceeded to open the lid, while the other &s;pread upon the ground a &s;ort of coar&s;e &s;heet, in order, as I pre&s;umed, to receive and wrap up the body. Sen&s;ibility de manded her &s;oliloquy upon this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Oh mo&s;t horrible barbarians! &s;aid I gently, not yet di&s;covering my&s;elf&mdash; Ah &s;acrilegious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &mdash; what are not our very a&s;hes &s;ecure from this venal world&mdash;mu&s;t our very bodies be &s;old after they are fixed many feet deep in the earth?&mdash;How often then doth the afflicted &s;urviver &s;hed his tear upon the &s;pot which he vainly &s;uppo&s;es is con&s;ecrated by the &s;acred du&s;t of a friend, when, haply, the corp&s;e of that very friend hath been
<PB N="134" REF="141">clande&s;tinely mangled by the in&s;ect|ing knife, and the beloved anatomy all the while decorating the dreadful repo&s;itory&mdash;or rather charnel-room of the &s;urgeon!&mdash;is this practice ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the experiments of a u&s;eful &s;cience? Do the lives and healths of the <HI>&s;urviving</HI> world depend in any degree upon it? It may be &s;o&mdash;but what a pang to a feeling heart is it, that tho&s;e who are employed in this formidable bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be &s;o de&s;ti|tute of&mdash;</P>
<P>I was inclined to check the pur&s;uit of the&s;e reflections for the pre&s;ent, by the appearance of a third man on hor&s;eback, who came to the &s;ide of the church-wall, and gave the &s;ignal of a whi&s;tle to the other two. This fellow was, I apprehend, to carry off the corp&s;e, which, to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="135" REF="142">they had now di&s;lodged from its peaceful apartment, and were going to bear it without any noi&s;e, to the hor&s;eman. At this awful cri&s;is of the tran&s;action the moon, which had been all the preceding part of the night ob&s;cured by the heavine&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, now broke forth glimmeringly, and di&s;played the figure of the dead man, and his robbers, to my eye. I &s;aw the pallid countenance, the livid lips, the clo&s;ed eye, and the &s;unk cheek, enfolded by the &s;hroud &mdash;I &s;aw the lifele&s;s limbs, pa&s;&s;ive and obedient to the de&s;igns of the plun|derer.&mdash;</P>
<P>Z&mdash;ds! cries the &s;exton, I feel &s;omething hard hanging at his brea&s;t here&mdash;what the devil can it be.</P>
<P>After a minutes &s;earch the &s;exton went on: by heavens! ma&s;ter Nabfle&s;h,
<PB N="136" REF="143">its one of your little brea&s;t pictures, and looke&mdash;'tis tied by a ribband round his neck&mdash;you mu&s;t know he was a devil for the wenches, and I'll lay my life this is the picture of one of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. It <HI>&s;hines</HI> a bit I think, and may be valuable: how|ever, good, or good for nothing, it has no bu&s;ine&s;s here, and being found upon <HI>my</HI> dead, it is, by the &s;exton laws &s;ettled, ever &s;ince men took it into their heads to die, <HI>my</HI> property. I can't pretend, ma&s;ter Earthworm, replied the other fellow, to deny your <HI>perqui&s;ite</HI>&mdash;every man of honour ought to have his <HI>dues,</HI> and &s;o I wi&s;h you joy: but, what a whim|&s;ical dog thou mu&s;t be (here he &s;truck the corp&s;e ludicrou&s;ly upon the face) to have &s;uch a pretty thing buried
<PB N="137" REF="144">with thee&mdash;a picture&mdash;eh? D&mdash;n me, I thank ye for <HI>that,</HI> ma&s;ter Dead man, &mdash;aye, thee wert a wag I warrant thee.</P>
<P>Here he &s;hook him by the chin, and the &s;exton was ju&s;t going to tug at his perqui&s;ite. The third man again whi&s;tled.</P>
<P>Every atom of my &s;oul and body was offended, and knowing the nature of guilt, I threw a&s;ide my coat and wai&s;tcoat, and folded a white pocket handerchief over my head, in con|formity to the vulgar idea of gho&s;ts, and &s;talked away towards the grave|robbers. They &s;aw&mdash;dropt their &s;poil, and ran very rapidly away.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign &s;ucceeded, and I &s;et my|&s;elf &s;oberly to work, in order to re|bury the in&s;ulted dead; re&s;olving,
<PB N="138" REF="145">neverthele&s;s, to have ample ju&s;tice inflicted upon the mercenary &s;exton in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Mean time the day-light broke upon my efforts, and yet I was re|&s;olved to fini&s;h my pious undertaking. I had depo&s;ited the corp&s;e (from which, however, I found the picture was &s;tolen) in its &s;olemn habitation, put it as decently as I could in the ground, and was proceeding to clo&s;e up the grave with the mould, when two

Eyeing me therefore as lawful game, they &s;oon &s;urrounded, and in the king's name, (while they &s;hook their lantherns, and &s;truck the ground with their &s;taves) took me pri&s;oner, and without a &s;ingle &s;lice of ceremony, bore me

<P>The wit had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than a &s;econd gentleman, in a tarn|i&s;hed tin&s;el-bound wai&s;tcoat, a dirty &s;hirt, and a laced hat, thought proper to make &s;ome &s;mart ob&s;ervations in my defence.

<P>This &s;econd man of humour had &s;omething &s;o particularly grote&s;que about him, his eye was &s;o vacant, and his countenance &s;o comic, that he was, <HI>&s;ocially</HI> &s;peaking, the life of the company, and like a true &s;on of the &s;cenes, fairly &s;et the round-hou&s;e in a roar. What added to the plea|&s;antry
<PB N="145" REF="152">of his character, was the pro|fe&s;&s;ional &s;trokes which he threw into his common conver&s;ation. A da&s;h of the drama mingled in all his di&s;|cour&s;e.

<P>In other words, and to &s;peak by a bolder figure, &s;ir, &s;aid the comedian, you had rather "reign in Hell, than &s;erve in Heaven:" I agree with you,

<P>The player was particularly plea&s;ed at this pro&s;pect, and expre&s;&s;ed his joy by a rhap&s;odical quotation, to do him ju&s;tice, not very inapplicable, con|&s;idering that there were &s;everal females in company.

<P>The conver&s;ation &s;hifted from love to politics, and from politics to religion &mdash;and now the gentleman who came merely for his <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> began to di&s;|play him&s;elf. He was touched upon his darling topic, and ob&s;erving a &s;ingu|larity in his &s;entiments, I entered into

<P>I arrived however, at la&s;t in Dover|&s;treet, at the now melancholy man&s;ion of my dear Draper, where I received the following card from Blake, who became particularly &s;ollicitous of late for my company, chiefly, (as I then fondly imagined) for the &s;ocial pur|po&s;e of &s;oothing the dejection that was &s;ettling upon my &s;pirits.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="174" REF="181">
<HEAD>To Benignus.</HEAD>
<P>Blake's compliments to Benignus, inviting him to a &s;nug party to-mor|row evening, at a particular friend and neighbour of Mr. Blake's, who&s;e oddity of humour, and &s;ingular me|thod of life, will perhaps di&s;&s;ipate unea&s;y thoughts.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>As I found greater relief any where, than in the hou&s;e which had &s;o recently lo&s;t its amiable proprietor, I accepted any random invitation that offered, rather than &s;ubject my&s;elf to the mi&s;ery of &s;uch poignant con|templation; and, accordingly, I obeyed the &s;ummons. I called upon Blake at the proper time, and he &s;aluted me thus.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="182">Chear up, my dear Benignus:&mdash;as the play &s;ays,
<Q><L>Do not for ever with thy veiled lids,</L>
<L>Grieve for thy noble Draper in the du&s;t.</L></Q> but endeavour to call plea&s;anter images to your aid&mdash;imitate, in &s;ome degree, the vivacity, and even the vacancy of your friend Green, whom I &s;hould have appointed to meet you, had he not changed his lodgings, and left us in the lurch,&mdash;but he is a citizen of the world, and &s;o all changes and chances of this mortal life are alike to him; and we &s;hall again hear from him, when the re|collection of the moment puts him in mind that there are &s;uch per&s;ons as you and I, exi&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="183">I will now take you in my hand to dine with a mo&s;t extraordinary cha|racter, who lives at the edge of the Common; and in the evening I expect a couple of friends to play a <HI>rubber,</HI> &s;o that upon our return, you &s;hall, without any ceremony join us, and we will make a &s;ociable night of it&mdash; do not &s;ay a word, for I will have no excu&s;es, Benignus.&mdash;It is three o'clock &mdash;draw on your gloves, and let us be gone.</P>
<P>I was introduced in great form to dine with this remarkable per&s;on, whom we found filling a large elbow chair, and altogether unable to pay his fir&s;t &s;alutations to us in any other way, than by a gentle &s;lope of the body, and even that &s;eemed to co&s;t him no &s;mall fatigue. It was on the
<PB N="177" REF="184">18th of July, and at twelve o'clock of a day, which was inten&s;ely &s;ultry when we reached Mr. Pinguefont's hou&s;e, which was as elegant and &s;u|perb, as if it had been de&s;igned for the temple of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. In going along, Blake told me, that I mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;everal cu&s;toms, at Mr. Pinguefont's, however new or out of the way they might be: notwith|&s;tanding which previous caution, and prepared as I was for &s;omething won|derful, &s;uch, and &s;o many were the oddities I was witne&s;s to, in the cour&s;e of this memorable vi&s;it, that I could not help betraying by looks, ge&s;tures, and even words, the entire a&s;toni&s;h|ment of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>There was in every room through which we pa&s;t, either a couch, a &s;opha,
<PB N="178" REF="185">or a kind of tent bed; and when we came to Pinguefont him&s;elf, at our fir&s;t entrance, the enormous bulk of his body, &s;o upheaved its va&s;tne&s;s, and <HI>&s;welled</HI> upon the eye, that, what I had before con&s;idered as the extra|vagance of fable, I now found unex|aggerated truth, and from that very moment, gave &s;wift credit for the hi&s;tory of the Brobdignagians.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou, my good reader, never taken a journey through the romantic roads of Derby&s;hire, or made an excur&s;ion be&s;ide the boundaries of Bri&s;tol, or rambled round the rocky regions of Scotland, or any other country, pregnant with poetical &s;enti|ment, and favourable to the alliterative bard?&mdash;Hath it not &s;ometimes hap|pened, in the&s;e thy wanderings, that
<PB N="179" REF="186">tru&s;ting to the &s;ure foot of thy &s;teed, or yielding to the la&s;&s;itude of a chai&s;e, thou ha&s;t inadvertently fallen into a momentary nap, out of which, &s;ome jolt or &s;tumble hath on a &s;udden arou&s;ed thee? At that in&s;tant, perad|venture, the fir&s;t and indeed only object that can command thy atten|tion, is the dead blank of &s;ome mighty mountain, di&s;playing its unweildly length and breadth before thee. If thou recollecte&s;t the &s;urpri&s;e of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;ight, thou wilt conceive <HI>&s;ome</HI> idea of the &s;en&s;ation which the prepo&s;ter|ous Pinguefont occa&s;ioned in my brea&s;t, when I fir&s;t beheld him: and that, even though I &s;aw him as was &s;aid before, wedged in his chair. His per&s;on however, and e&s;pecially his face, was plea&s;ing in &s;pite of pleni|tude,
<PB N="180" REF="187">nor was it perhaps in nature to per&s;erve more of the <HI>agreeable</HI> in fea|tures which maintained &s;uch a pro|fu&s;ion of fle&s;h. His complexion was almo&s;t femininely fair, and the only apparent defects about him were in his eyes, which were heavy, large, and lethargic.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aw us, he very cor|dially de&s;ired us to &s;it down, apolo|gizing at the &s;ame time, for his own rudene&s;s in keeping his &s;eat; but &s;aid he, &s;miling, you &s;ee gentlemen how it is, you might as well move the hou&s;e as the ma&s;ter&mdash;what of that? Laugh and grow fat is my rule, and I will maintain it again&s;t all the &s;tarveling maxims upon earth Eat, drink, and &s;leep&mdash;that's the &s;cience; eat and &s;leep care away, drink and be merry
<PB N="181" REF="188">&mdash;Heh?&mdash;what &s;ay you?&mdash;then turn|ing his eyes to me&mdash;you'll excu&s;e me, &s;ir&mdash;every man in own humour you know. By all means (&s;aid I) &s;ir, bowing. He applied to the bell which was at his elbow. A &s;ervant came creeping on tiptoe, and cocked his eye through a little oval hole in the door, which was concealed on the out&s;ide by a &s;mall green curtain; after which he di&s;appeared a few mo|ments, and then came into the room without ceremony. The alderman (for &s;uch he was) inquired about dinner, and being told that it was not to be ready till four o'clock, and that now it was but barely <HI>one,</HI> pro|te&s;ted he mu&s;t have a &s;nack for all that, a&s;&s;uring us at the &s;ame time, that he had not eat any thing the&s;e
<PB N="182" REF="189"><HI>three hours.</HI> The man di&s;appeared a &s;econd time, and we now were all &s;eated on the afore&s;aid 18th of July, round &s;uch a fire, as in the &s;everity of a Siberian winter, might have been extremely comfortable, and agreeably &s;corching. My friend reading a &s;uf|ficient degree of a&s;toni&s;hment in my features, was going, I believe in a whi&s;per to relieve me; but on ca&s;ting his eye upon the late laughing Pingue|font, he found a whi&s;per unnece&s;&s;ary; for the Alderman had forgone his &s;nack, and without giving us the lea&s;t warning of his intentions, was fa&s;t warning of his intentions, was fa&s;t a&s;leep with his face parallel to the fir&s;t bar of the grate. Heaven, &s;aid I, if the gentleman&mdash;hu&s;h &s;aid Blake&mdash;The footman again came &s;quinting to the door, but how he got off I know not,
<PB N="183" REF="190">for my eye &s;aw not, neither did my ear, hear any thing like the fall of a foot. My friend now informed me, that the Alderman was &s;ubject to &s;omnific fits, which often &s;et him to &s;leep in a minute; and that he has been actually known to &s;tand en|tranced, while his own hor&s;e, on who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s great betts were de|pending, while he was galloping round the cour&s;e. That cut in the door, is on purpo&s;e for the &s;ervants to &s;ee whether the Alderman is &s;leeping or waking: if the former, they mu&s;t on no account di&s;turb him, although the mo&s;t urgent bu&s;ine&s;s require it; and this is a &s;tipulated article in his agree|ment with all his adherents, a breach of which is the forfeiture of their places. Perhaps he will continue in
<PB N="184" REF="191">this &s;ituation a great while, and po&s;|&s;ibly he may wake in a moment; and when he does, he will make ample amends to you for the lo&s;s of time. He had &s;carce fini&s;hed, when the Al|derman exclaimed,&mdash;what are you at, ra&s;cals?&mdash;Zounds and the devil, bring up the dinner. This exclamation ap|peared to be a vagarie of &s;leep, but as if the idea of eating, even in a dream, was &s;ufficient to beat an alarm to appetite, Pinguefont, unclo&s;ed his eyes, and again fixt his finger, as if mechanically upon the bell. At the &s;ame time, looking at us.&mdash;Ah my, dear friends, &s;aid he, pray forgive me&mdash;pray forgive me, young &s;tranger; your companion knows my humour, and all the world can tell you, that I &s;leep more than all things on earth:
<PB N="185" REF="192">but come, perhaps I &s;hall now have an uninterrupted hour, and if I don't have &s;ixty minutes fe&s;tivity for it, I &s;hall accu&s;e my&s;elf of murder. Din|ner this moment, Timotheus, &s;aid he to the &s;ervant, who now came into the room after the u&s;ual prefatory peep; for it &s;eems, if the company were ever &s;o numerous, no dome&s;tic was &s;uffered to an&s;wer any bell which was not rung by the ma&s;ter. Mr. Timotheus made a nimble exit, and in le&s;s than ten minutes came to in|form us, the table waited, and the company were all come.&mdash;I looked &s;ignificantly ignorant at my friend: he mu&s;tered a &s;mile&mdash;and we walked &s;olemn and &s;low in the rear of the mighty Pinguefont.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193">After Pinguefont had plentifully appea&s;ed the vehement attacks of his appetite, and was preparing to enjoy the jollity of his friend and bottle, a &s;omnific fit again overtook him, his vacant eye clo&s;ed upon the company, and, in the next in&s;tant, he was &s;nor|ing in his chair.</P>
<P>Bountiful heaven! &s;aid I, upon what an animal the &s;un of thy pro&s;|perity &s;hineth! And can it be po&s;|&s;ible, that a creature endowed with &s;uch faculties as man, formed al&s;o for immortal purpo&s;es, &s;hould limit his ambition to the plea&s;ures of food and &s;leep? Can that be happine&s;s? Can the &s;oaring mind be contented with &s;uch gro&s;s <HI>corporeal</HI> gratifications? Or can <HI>he</HI> who&s;e exi&s;tence is confined to the narrow circle of a few fleeting
<PB N="187" REF="194">years, &s;uffer them to e&s;cape without leaving any traces that de&s;erves <HI>re|collection?</HI> The bu&s;ine&s;s of that mortal's life, is to <HI>eat, drink,</HI> and <HI>&s;leep;</HI> and by &s;uch marks <HI>alone</HI> &s;hall be remembered in his generation! How is it then that (trifler as he is) Plenty &s;miles at his table, and Peace &s;preads her plumes over his pillow? How many beds are there in this hou&s;e, which neither the &s;leeping proprietor, nor his friends can occupy? Ah that the limbs of the wanderer, the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and tho&s;e who are now vainly in &s;earch of a &s;helter might find it <HI>here!</HI></P>
<P>The cour&s;e of the&s;e reflections were impeded by a tap upon the &s;houlder from Mr. Blake, who, informing me in a whi&s;per, that the joke was pa&s;&s;ed, and that Pinguefont had di&s;covered
<PB N="188" REF="195">as much of him&s;elf as was worth &s;eeing, propo&s;ed that we &s;hould take advantage of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and, under cover of the clo&s;ed eyelid, make the be&s;t of our way to a di&s;h of tea with his (Blake's) hou&s;e|keeper.</P>
<P>Never was there a more &s;erene or beautiful afternoon than that which was now before us, and every object was gilded by the milde&s;t beams of the &s;un. Blake bade me take notice of the &s;cene, and derive from it fre&s;h &s;ources of entertainment.</P>
<P>Ah Mr. Blake, &s;aid I, tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which were lately &s;o agree|able, have lo&s;t their power: neither the oddities of a Pinguefont, nor the chearful rays of an evening &s;un can in&s;pire the vivacity which, a few weeks
<PB N="189" REF="196">&s;ince, broke out upon every occa&s;ion; and believe me, &s;ir, the &s;cene you recommend to my attention, might as well have been inveloped in a fog &mdash;my friend is in the grave, and the woman whom I loved has deceived me.</P>
<P>P&s;haw! rejoined Blake&mdash;don't de&s;|pair; admitting that friend to be valuable, and that mi&s;tre&s;s hand&s;ome, have they, do you &s;uppo&s;e, mono|polized all the merit and beauty to them&s;elves? No &s;urely. Prithee then, Benignus, ca&s;t thine eye upon &s;ome other objects, and never doubt but your pre&s;ent lo&s;s, however great, admits of reparation. As you are a <HI>book</HI> man, let the poets admini&s;ter con&s;olation: they may properly be called the &s;ons of hope; and a youth
<PB N="190" REF="197">of imagination, as you are, may be entertained with the pro&s;pects of the Mu&s;e, that is, an ingenious <HI>head,</HI> when all the &s;ugge&s;tions of the &s;oul, which is mightily addicted to plain pro&s;e&mdash;will only &s;erve to vex, and make you melancholy. Recollect what old <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> &s;ays, upon the &s;ubject of a lo&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s. Some ver&s;es are at this moment flowing to the tip of my tongue, exactly in point.

<P>In &s;hort, Benignus, to end the whole matter, and if you will allow me once more to reinforce my ar|gument with tho&s;e of the Poet:

<P>Under all this appearance of ho|ne&s;ty and good humour, I had &s;oon too much rea&s;on to di&s;cover that Blake was a villain. The company he expected con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;tran|gers, to whom he introduced me as his particular friend, were a&s;&s;em|bled in the front parlour, about five minutes before us, and the hou&s;e|keeper was entertaining them with her u&s;ual vivacity.</P>
<P>This &s;ame hou&s;e-keeper I have al|ready de&s;cribed as a lively, buxom, plump, plea&s;urable woman, and her
<PB N="193" REF="200">company was &s;o chearful, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for melancholy it&s;elf, not to abate &s;omething of its u&s;ual gloom in it. But, how ju&s;t, as proper, is it upon all occa&s;ions to remember, that "all which glitters is not gold," and to act indeed, as if we apprehended people were impo&s;ing upon us a much ba&s;er metal, gaudily gilded upon the &s;urface in order to make it pa&s;s current.</P>
<P>The fatal evening was however now before me. Soon after tea, Mr. Blake (who by the by, was unu&s;ually lively) informed us that he had re|ceived a pre&s;ent, of which he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, we &s;hould have the maiden|head: no le&s;s, gentlemen, &s;aid he, than a hamper of the be&s;t Burgundy that ever &s;parkled to the eye, and
<PB N="194" REF="201">invited the &s;ons of &s;orrow to good &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The &s;trangers a&s;&s;ented to the pro|po&s;al, and I (who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to prevent melancholy, either by <HI>drown|ing</HI> it in the gla&s;s, or any other way) did not remain ob&s;tinate: Bumpers were the word&mdash;Blake and his friends (who ho&s;pitably in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;wal|lowing more than I could bear) af|fected at length to be &s;ubdued, and were rolling before &s;upper under the table, from whence the &s;ervants, with much &s;eeming difficulty, bore them up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Blake her&s;elf, had indulged in a gla&s;s extraordinary on this occa&s;ion. &mdash;It was a calm night&mdash;the claret took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brain&mdash;folly, and forgetfulne&s;s triumphed.&mdash;Mrs.
<PB N="195" REF="202">Blake looked <HI>"nothing loath;"</HI>&mdash;there was a couch in the room&mdash;&s;he was but a <HI>hou&s;ekeeper</HI>&mdash;occa&s;ion a&s;&s;i&s;ted the revel of the pul&s;es&mdash;rea&s;on toppled, and&mdash;to my &s;hame be it &s;poken, I indulged the delicious in&s;anity, and rioted in the overwhelming tempta|tion of the moment.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is, the door was bur&s;t open &mdash; Blake and his companions ru&s;hed in, the former running to his pi&s;tols which were &s;lung acro&s;s the chimney-piece, and roaring out as he ran&mdash;Oh villain, villain!&mdash;you have made a pro&s;titute of my lawful wife. I'll &s;hoot you through the head&mdash;you have taken advantage of my gratitude and friend&s;hip, to di&s;|honour my &s;acred wife.&mdash;Oh villain, villain! I will kill you on the &s;pot."
<PB N="196" REF="203">At the end of this harangue, he ac|tually cocked the pi&s;tol, apparently in a great rage, and pre&s;ented it to my head, when one of his companions catching him by the arm, di&s;&s;uaded him from the horrible crime of mur|der, alledging that Mrs. Blake was not worth it&mdash;but advi&s;ed him, never|thele&s;s, to &s;eek redre&s;s for this bleed|ing injury, from the laws of the land. Then &s;truggling with him, they by main force got him out of the room, and left us again together.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of this conduct (to tell my folly in a few words) were, my being ca&s;t in a court of ju&s;tice&mdash;having my name ten times more blown upon than before&mdash;feeling more poignantly than ever the &s;tings of my own con&s;cience, and being
<PB N="197" REF="204">compelled to pay into the hands of Blake, two thou&s;and five hundred pounds by way of damages.</P>

<P>Though I was &s;oon convinced, Mrs. Blake was in the plot re&s;|pecting the pro&s;ecution; yet it hither|to never once entered my head, that &s;he was at once a <HI>wife,</HI> and a <HI>pro&s;titute;</HI> for &s;he really acted the blu&s;hful bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well, and yielded in &s;o coy a manner, that I always &s;up|po&s;ed the ki&s;&s;ing part of the &s;tory, according to the proverb, went <HI>&s;o</HI> far by favour, that I was the <HI>&s;econd</HI> per&s;on who had &s;ubdued the citadel of her virtue. But the very day
<PB N="198" REF="205">after I had paid my damage money, I found certain &s;ymptoms that pret|ty plainly denoted, the hu&s;band was not the only per&s;on who, literally &s;peaking, received an <HI>injury.</HI> In a word, I was obliged to make enquiries after a doctor. But I did not much like to a&s;k Benjamim, or a &s;ervant, about phy&s;ical people (&s;o &s;u&s;picious is guilt) le&s;t he might gue&s;s the na|ture of my complaint; to prevent which, I &s;neaked into a coffee-hou&s;e, and &s;etting my&s;elf down (like a de|jected wretch as I was) in a &s;olitary box, began to read the papers, which, I recollected, were commonly half filled with the no&s;trums of the&s;e gen|try.</P>
<P>Among&s;t a number of adverti|&s;ers, each of which profe&s;&s;ed to cure
<PB N="199" REF="206">the mo&s;t dreadful di&s;order, <HI>&s;ooner than any other medicine in Europe;</HI> I was principally attracted by one that un|dertook to make a man of me again, for <HI>five gnineas;</HI> and <HI>that</HI> too by the gentle&s;t remedy in the world, "with|out lo&s;s of time, hindrance of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or per&s;onal confinement." But what weighed mo&s;t with me, was his <HI>N. B.</HI> at the bottom, wherein he engaged him&s;elf, as a <HI>man of honour,</HI> to keep my &s;ecret; and that, more|over, there was a private door, for the convenience of cu&s;tomers, who for the &s;ake of delicacy, might not choo&s;e to come into the open &s;hop.</P>
<P>This was the very thing I wanted, and taking down the direction from the adverti&s;ement, I made the be&s;t of my way to the private door.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="207">It is really &s;urpri&s;ing to con&s;ider how often the &s;oul extracts honey from poi&s;on, or in other words, good from evil.</P>
<P>As I went along the &s;treet, I thought my&s;elf under &s;ome &s;ort of obligation to Mrs. Blake; for to own the truth, I had now &s;ome little &s;u&s;|picion that her <HI>hu&s;band</HI> might have drawn her into this infamous mea|&s;ure of obtaining a &s;um of money, and that I had on my part, a charge again&s;t my con&s;cience for being only the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> in&s;trument of her de|bauchery. Upon the whole there|fore, I congratulated my&s;elf upon this di&s;covery, and as I &s;uppo&s;ed my health would (agreeable to the pro|mi&s;es of the adverti&s;er) be perfectly re|&s;tored to me in a fortnight, I en|deavoured
<PB N="201" REF="208">to make light of the mat|ter, and walked bri&s;kly away to a &s;hop a few doors from the Bell Savage, on Ludgate-hill. The ma&s;ter, who&s;e name was Drug, happened to be then in the &s;hop, and conducted me into a little parlour&mdash;where being &s;eated he bade me not be alarmed, for that, &s;uch misfortunes were quite fa&s;hionable, and he would &s;et me to rights in a hurry.</P>
<P>Not, however, to trouble the reader with a repetition of this fellow's abo|minable crambo conver&s;ation, be it enough to ob&s;erve that, after having tampered with me for <HI>&s;ix weeks,</HI> and picking my pocket of 20 guineas; (for the five guineas, it &s;eems, was only a compliment for the care, and the re&s;t were for medicines) he left me in a &s;ituation &s;o much wor&s;e,
<PB N="202" REF="209">that I was forced at la&s;t, to &s;eek relief from a man of reputation, and who had the additional labour to <HI>undo</HI> every thing that had been <HI>done for,</HI> or rather <HI>again&s;t</HI> me, by Dr. Drug.</P>
<P>I was not able to quit my chamber for <HI>two months,</HI> during which time, I ordered my&s;elf to be denied to every body, (Mrs. Darlington and Alicia had long given me up) and was thought to be dead by all my acquaintances. At la&s;t I began to pick up a little. Benjamin, only Benjamin was &s;uffered to be admitted to me as a friend. I was &s;o weak with grief, di&s;ea&s;e, and water-gruel, that I could hardly crawl from chair to chair: and the fir&s;t time I &s;urveyed my figure in the gla&s;s, I fainted away at the horror of &s;uch an alteration.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="210">In the mid&s;t of a &s;ituation like this it was, that I found my affairs were in a de&s;perate condition, that my carele&s;&s;ne&s;s had &s;ubjected me to the mo&s;t expen&s;ive impo&s;itions; and that to complete the whole, Mrs. Darling|ton had received a vi&s;it from the Grocer, who, after having by my means, recovered his wife and daughter, loaded me with every epithet that could di&s;grace the hu|man character.</P>

<P>At this mo&s;t critical juncture, I received a long epi&s;tle from Mr. Greaves, to whom, in the height of my mi&s;eries (in order to &s;oothe the
<PB N="204" REF="211">languid hours of confinement) I wrote a fair, and full account of my&s;elf &s;ince his departure. <HI>His</HI> epi&s;tle is too e&s;timable; and the great <HI>fact</HI> it elucidates too important, either to abridge or &s;uppre&s;s, as it may be con&s;idered in the light of a <HI>moral</HI> to <HI>all</HI> my enterpri&s;es, and all the &s;ad effects ari&s;ing from them; upon which account I &s;hall give it to my reader <HI>entire,</HI> both as a trea&s;ure, and as a caveat.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXXXIX.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>From Mr. GREAVES, to BENIGNUS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear, unhappy Benignus.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your la&s;t letter found me in the peaceful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my&s;elf, my
<PB N="205" REF="212">fortune, an elegant retreat, and a truly penitent daughter; and yet, all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings were ab&s;orbed in my &s;ympathy for you. The account you give of your&s;elf, is indeed alarming: yet I prophe&s;ied almo&s;t as much, when I fir&s;t travelled with you to London: to London, the de&s;troyer of morals, the mark of temptation, and &s;educer of the heart. Tho&s;e indeed, whom bu&s;ine&s;s perpetually chains down to the counter; tho&s;e who pa&s;s their lives amid the bu&s;tle of employment; tho&s;e of the mo&s;t rigid re&s;olution, and inflexible philo&s;ophy; tho&s;e are the only people, at your time of life, who can live in that great metropolis without danger&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid, without de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213"><HI>You</HI> entered that city, Benignus, and began to encounter the arts of it, under all po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantages: every one of your antagoni&s;ts were armed at all points, while you were naked: you had neither the &s;word of defence, nor the &s;hield of di&s;cretion. In &s;uch a helple&s;s &s;ituation what could be expected <HI>better</HI> than what has really happened?&mdash;Di&s;ea&s;e, di&s;grace, di&s;|a&s;ter, and defeat.</P>
<P>Can you bear &s;incerity? Benignus, you were wrong at the out&s;et. A young man &s;etting formally out in &s;earch of happine&s;s! Your time has been wa&s;ted with your e&s;tate, and you are infinitely more wretched than when you began your <HI>romantic journey.</HI></P>
<P>Since you began to traver&s;e the city, in which &s;o much money has
<PB N="207" REF="214">already been &s;quandered, what have you on the creditor &s;ide to ballance the charge? One day you have been mortified by neglect, and at another you have been wounded by fal&s;e promi&s;es. Were I the parent of twenty children, I &s;incerely declare to you, I had rather have, <HI>one</HI> turn out avaricious, <HI>another</HI> ill-tempered, a <HI>third</HI> fanta&s;tical, a <HI>fourth</HI> licentious, and &s;o on of the re&s;t, exhau&s;ting al|mo&s;t the circle of imperfection&mdash;ra|ther I &s;ay, Benignus, than any one of them &s;hould, to &s;uch a <HI>perfection,</HI> have your <HI>imperfection,</HI> if you'll allow me the phra&s;e. Don't however mi&s;|take me: it is not becau&s;e I think you unamiable; it is, becau&s;e of all I ever knew, you po&s;&s;e&s;s in the mo&s;t fatal degree, the qualities that are in
<PB N="208" REF="215">the end the mo&s;t likely to plunge a poinard in your heart, or a bullet in your head.</P>
<P>Heavens, Benignus! how have you &s;uffered the weakne&s;s of the heart, to triumph thus long over the &s;olid powers of rea&s;on and the under&s;tand|ing? How have you permitted that very tenderne&s;s (which properly re|gulated might, at a third of the ex|pence, have circulated joy) to be pro|ductive of little good, and great mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>As to the good you have done, it is, as far as I can learn, in no degree proportioned to the money u&s;ed to procure it: the very <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of it is lo&s;t, by being <HI>indi&s;criminate.</HI> If, this hour, you have comforted the di&s;con&s;olate bo&s;om of humble merit
<PB N="209" REF="216">in the &s;hade; you have in the next, lavi&s;hed as large a bounty on a knave, a gambler, or a coxcomb.</P>
<P>Into what innumerable tempta|tions have you thrown your&s;elf, by the indulgence of a fatal curio&s;ity! it is only by <HI>flying</HI> from temptation, that youth and &s;pirits can po&s;&s;ibly avoid them. Believe not the cant of &s;choolmen, when they tell you that virtue is the unmoved rock, again&s;t which the waves of pa&s;&s;ion beat inef|fectually. Virtue, indeed, is in the well-di&s;po&s;ed mind, a powerful prin|ciple; but alas! when it comes to be a&s;&s;ailed in the hey-day of the &s;pirits, &s;ollicited by opportunity&mdash;when a thou&s;and &s;oftening circum&s;tances, treacherou&s;ly meet together, con|federating as it were to urge the
<PB N="210" REF="217">heart into voluptuous conce&s;&s;ions, <HI>where,</HI> Benignus, is the young <HI>man, where</HI> the young <HI>woman,</HI> who can long boa&s;t the un&s;ubdued &s;uperiority of virtue. As there is a temptation &s;uited to every con&s;titution, &s;o is there I fear an hour, when every con&s;titution mu&s;t either precipitately retreat, or be vanqui&s;hed. To re|treat therefore <HI>in time,</HI> is the greate&s;t effort, both of prudence, wi&s;dom, and philo&s;ophy: when the pa&s;&s;ions have only exhibited to us their pro&s;pects, when the eye &s;parkles to behold them, and the heart throbs to enjoy them, it is an hundred to one, if either rea|&s;on, virtue, or principles of any kind, are at your age &s;ufficient to &s;ave you.</P>
<P>And are you &s;till a generous vaga|bond, Benignus? Are you &s;till ram|bling
<PB N="211" REF="218">about the &s;treets of the me|tropolis, a benevolent &s;troller&mdash;a prey to impo&s;ture, an angui&s;h to your friends, and a di&s;tre&s;s to your&s;elf? Do you call this "going about doing good!" No &s;ir, it is going about, doing nothing.</P>
<P>By chance, indeed, the mo&s;t &s;cat|tering liberality may blunder into an act of benevolence; but when a few, a very few of the&s;e are ex|cepted, you might ju&s;t as well have jerked your money from London|bridge into the Thames, as have thrown it about &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I write warmly, Benignus, becau&s;e I write feelingly, and becau&s;e I love you. I love you, &s;ir, for the naturally noble excellencies of your di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="212" REF="219">but not for the extravagant abu&s;e of them. There are, perhaps, few men in this kingdom, who might have more &s;plendidly figured in it: your talents, fortune, and turn of mind, might have done honour to your&s;elf, to your &s;ociety, to your connections, and to human nature. In&s;tead of which, by ru&s;hing madly upon the world, the dreadful hi&s;tory of your &s;ituation is, that you belong to no|body, are known to nobody, and are nobody.</P>
<P>What, Benignus, will be the ul|timate event of it? I tremble at the pro&s;pect. In the name of common &s;en&s;e, &s;top, &s;top your career. It may not yet be too late. I do not perceive you have, in all your wanderings,
<PB N="213" REF="220">purcha&s;ed a &s;ingle friend who would give you a dinner, &s;hould it (which God forbid) ever be wanting. I &s;ee you have violent pa&s;&s;ions, which, though they might have lain dor|mant in a village, have been called out in London: pa&s;&s;ions always ty|ranni&s;e in proportion as they are in|dulged; and I much fear&mdash;you will pardon me&mdash;you are not quite the &s;ame Benignus you were, in point of <HI>delicacy.</HI> Be that as it may, your ca&s;e is to be compa&s;&s;ionated. How applicable to Benignus is the language of hone&s;t Apemantus. "Oh ye Gods, what a number of men eat Timon, and he &s;ees them not!"</P>
<P>Let me charge you to beware of becoming as it were a bankrupt, in
<PB N="214" REF="221">London. I know that I appear to you very rude, and indeed I am doing a great violence to my&s;elf; but if this &s;trength of colouring, if this picture faithfully drawn by the hand of a friend, &s;erves to wean you from an attachment to the place you are now in, and can bring you to the quiet &s;pot whence this is dated, I &s;hall rejoice in the fortitude of having been &s;incere.</P>
<P>Every thing about us, by the time you reach us, will be in their &s;ummer &s;uits to invite you: our fruit-trees are in blo&s;&s;om; our ro&s;e-trees are budded; there are fi&s;h in the ponds, and birds build &s;ecure within our hedges. Almeria is godde&s;s of the flower-garden, and &s;he, &s;milingly,
<PB N="215" REF="222">bids me tell you, how much &s;he wants an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to tie up the ten|drils, and to hand the watering-pot from the well.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, my dear Benignus, your &s;incere well-wi&s;her</SIGNED>
<SALUTE>WILLIAM GREAVES.</SALUTE>

<P>P. S. Finding my&s;elf too apt to di&s;&s;ipate in the earlier part of my life, I bound my&s;elf as it were an apprentice to di&s;cretion, by an ob|&s;ervance of certain <HI>rules,</HI> which for more than twice &s;even years have now been the guide of my <HI>pecuniary</HI> conduct.

<P>There is great rea&s;on for us to make a re&s;erve of property again&s;t the day of decrepitude; becau&s;e in old age, we want <HI>chiefly</HI> tho&s;e com|forts which <HI>only money</HI> can procure: a comfortable hou&s;e&mdash;a warm fire&mdash; delicate living, and a little &s;hare of authority, which, in the la&s;t &s;tage of life, is exceedingly &s;oothing and ac|ceptable.</P>

<P>Perhaps &s;ociety cannot &s;hew a more pitiable figure, than either a very old man or woman, who having &s;pent their &s;ub&s;tance in the flattering gaie|ties of youth, are reduced (in the mo&s;t helple&s;s &s;ituation) to live upon accidental &s;trokes of genero&s;ity, and to be at once ridiculed and re|lieved.</P>

<P>If an old per&s;on expects to receive the lea&s;t degree of attention from the world in general, or even from his relations in particular, it mu&s;t be by the force of happy circum&s;tances in his favour; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as ari&s;e out of a fortune accumulated by the indu&s;try or ingenuity of youth. This will render the veteran re&s;pectable
<PB N="218" REF="225">among&s;t his dome&s;tics, and make even his utmo&s;t infirmities &s;upport|able. Whereas, if an old man has no te&s;timonies of his oeconomy to &s;hew, he will crawl contemptibly about the world; be upbraided for his former prodigality, even by his own children, who, having no <HI>hopes,</HI> will con&s;ider him as an incumbrance: and wanting the various attentions which are nece&s;&s;ary to the accom|modation of the la&s;t &s;cene, his con|tinuance in the family will be irk|&s;ome, his life mu&s;t be &s;upported by the contribution of the charitable, and he mu&s;t die unmourned. Keep the &s;taff in thine hand.</P>

<P>The &s;ame principle of prudence which makes it nece&s;&s;ary for a man
<PB N="219" REF="226">to provide again&s;t the wants and infirmities of <HI>age,</HI> &s;hould prevail with a man to provide again&s;t the wants and infirmities of <HI>di&s;temper.</HI> Let the &s;ick man rather depend on the panacea of his pur&s;e, than on the pity of his phy&s;ician. A very healthy per&s;on is very &s;oon reduced to his chamber, and we are all liable to the mo&s;t noi&s;ome di&s;orders: it often hap|pens that a &s;tout young man in the very vigour of exi&s;tence, is brought to &s;uch a &s;tate as to depend on the &s;ervitude of another for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in tho&s;e very points, which, in a &s;tate of health, he would blu&s;h to make known to a &s;econd per&s;on.

A &s;ick &s;pendthrift is therefore a hor|rid &s;pectacle; his nur&s;e becomes neg|ligent, his phy&s;ician gives him now and then a call upon the &s;core of humanity&mdash;he wants the &s;trength|ening and re&s;toring comforts both of the kitchen and the arm-chair; and, what is wor&s;e than all, he <HI>rebukes him&s;elf</HI> for having &s;quandered, in the hour of &s;uperfluity, what &s;hould have been re&s;erved for the moment of exigence.</P>
