<P>I AM happy that the mode of dedication pre&s;ents me with an opportunity of paying even &s;o &s;mall a portion of that re&s;pectful tribute due to politene&s;s, probity, and candour, as laying this Farce at your feet; but mo&s;t particularly, I felicitate my&s;elf on an occa&s;ion of offering my acknowledgment of thanks, for the great part you bore in the &s;ucce&s;s of the SON-IN-LAW. By the indulgent reception with which you fa|voured my fir&s;t piece, I was flattered into a de&s;ire, of attempting a &s;econd, when you fir&s;t pointed out the principal material; and then, by your judicious alterations, happy additions, and &s;trict attention to the conduct, you pro|moted the SON-IN-LAW to whatever rank it now

The town, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of judgment to perceive merit, and liberality to reward it, &s;eems, by its beneficent patronage, &s;en&s;ible of your endeavours and abi|lities, to render the drama upon your Theatre, what it &s;hould be, an entertainment of ele|gance, in&s;truction, and delight. That each purpo&s;e is amply an&s;wered, accept my &s;incere congratulation.
