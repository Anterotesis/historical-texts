<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE author of the following Eclogue, having reque&s;ted my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to introduce it to the world; it was with more indignation than &s;urprize I was informed of your having u&s;ed your exten&s;ive influence over the pre&s;s to prevent its being adverti&s;ed in the News-papers. How are you, Sir, concerned in the Lamentation of <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> for his <HI>Nyky?</HI> Does your mode&s;ty think no man entitled to the appellation of Ro&s;cius but your&s;elf? Does Nyky re&s;emble any nick-named fa|vourite of yours? Or does it follow, that if you have cheri&s;hed an un|worthy favourite, you mu&s;t bear too near a re&s;emblance to him? <HI>Qui capit ille facit;</HI> beware of &s;elf-accu&s;ation, where others bring no charge! Or, granting you right in the&s;e particulars, by what right or privilege do you, Sir, &s;et up for a licen&s;er of the pre&s;s? That you have long &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;urped that privilege, to &s;well both your fame and fortune, is well known. Not the puffs of the quacks of Bay&s;|water and Chel&s;ea are &s;o numerous and notorious: but by what au|thority do you take upon you to &s;hut up the general channel, in which writers u&s;her their performances to the public? If they at|tack either your talents or your character, <HI>in utrumque paratus,</HI> you are armed to defend your&s;elf. You have, be&s;ides your ingenuous countenance and con&s;cious innocence; <HI>Nil con&s;cire &s;ibi, nulla pal|le&s;cere culpa;</HI> Be&s;ides this brazen bulwark, I &s;ay, you have a ready pen and a long pur&s;e. The pre&s;s is open to the one, and the bar is ever ready to open with the other. For a poor author, not a printer will publi&s;h a paragraph, not a pleader will utter a quib|ble. You have then every advantage in the conte&s;t: It is need|le&s;s, therefore, to endeavour to intimidate your antagoni&s;ts by countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives! The&s;e in|timidations, let me tell you Sir, have an ugly, &s;u&s;picious look. They are be&s;ides needle&s;s; the <HI>genus irritabile vatum</HI> want no &s;uch per&s;onal provocations; Heaven knows, the life of a play-wright, like that of a &s;pider, is in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t &s;lender dependency. It is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on &s;o &s;light a thread. He thinks, neverthele&s;s, that he has rea&s;on to complain, as well as the publick, of your having long preferred the flimzy, tran&s;lated, patch'd-up and mi&s;-altered pieces of your favourite com|pilers, to the arduous attempts at originality of writers, who have no per&s;onal intere&s;t with the manager. In particular, he thinks
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the two pieces, you are projecting to get up next winter, for the emolument of your favorite in di&s;grace, or to reimbur&s;e your&s;elf the money, you may have advanced him, might, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>But you will a&s;k me, perhaps, in turn, Sir, what right I have to interfere with the bu&s;ine&s;s of other people, or with yours? I will an&s;wer you. It is becau&s;e I think your bu&s;ine&s;s, as patentee of a theatre-royal, is not &s;o entirely yours, but that the publick al&s;o have &s;ome concern in it. You, Sir, indeed have long be|haved as if you thought the town it&s;elf a purcha&s;ed appurtenance to the theatre; but, tho' the &s;cenes and machines are yours; nay, tho' you have even found means to make comedians and poets your property; it &s;hould be with more caution than you practi&s;e, that you extend your various arts to make &s;o &s;candalous a proper|ty of the publick.</P>
<P>Again I an&s;wer, it is becau&s;e I have &s;ome regard for my friend, and as much for my&s;elf, whom you have treated as ill perhaps as you have done any other writer; while under your au&s;pices, &s;ome of the per&s;ons &s;tigmati&s;ed by the &s;atiri&s;t, have frequently combined to do me the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential injury. But <HI>nemo me impur&egrave; lace&s;&s;it.</HI> Not that I mean now to enter into particulars which may be thought to relate too much to my&s;elf and too little to the publick. When I &s;hall have lei&s;ure to draw a faithful portraiture of Mr. Garrick, not only from his behaviour to me in particular, but from his conduct towards poets, players and the town in general, I doubt not to convince the mo&s;t partial of his admirers that he hath accumulated a fortune, as manager, by the meane&s;t and mo&s;t me|retricious devices, and that the theatrical props, which have long &s;upported his exalted reputation, as an actor, have been rai&s;ed on the ruins of the English &s;tage.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I leave you to amu&s;e your&s;elf with the follow|ing jeu d'e&s;prit of my friend; hoping, tho' it be a &s;evere correction for the errours of your pa&s;t favouriti&s;m, it may prove a &s;alutary guide to you for the future. With regard to the mode of its publica|tion I hope al&s;o to &s;tand excu&s;ed with the reader for thus interpo&s;ing to defeat the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e arts, which you &s;o unfairly practi&s;e to prevent, from reaching the public eye, whatever is di&s;agreeable to your own.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In reprehending the faults of other men you &s;hould ever be cau|tious of falling into the error you condemn. In ye&s;terday's paper you indirectly charge me, among others, with having "urged a dete&s;ta|ble charge with as much folly as wickedne&s;s again&s;t a certain great actor."&mdash;What other people have done I know not, nor does it con|cern me; but I may &s;afely defy all the Lawyers in We&s;tmin&s;ter-|Hall fairly to deduce &s;uch a charge as you hint at from the eclogue in que&s;tion. In this re&s;pect it is certainly as innocent as the great actor's Jubilee Ode! But granting it otherwi&s;e with any one el&s;e, how can you take upon you to &s;ay that &s;uch a charge is urged <HI>fooli&s;hly and wickedly?</HI> Can <HI>you</HI> know it to be fal&s;e or groundle&s;s? And if not, on what grounds do you charge the accu&s;ers with <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>wickedne&s;s?</HI> Why does not the CANDOUR of the great actor, reply to the Queries put to him in your paper of Saturday la&s;t? But no; unable to ju&s;tify him&s;elf at the bar of the publick, he flies for refuge to the quirks and quibbles of We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall; and even this at the latter end of a term, in order to deceive the town into a notion that the court will countenance his pro&s;ecution. Why was not his motion made &s;ooner, that cau&s;e might have been &s;hewn in time, and the futility of it made immediately evident? Believe me, Sir, before an end is put to this bu&s;ine&s;s, the publick will be better enabled to judge on which &s;ide the <HI>folly and wickedne&s;s</HI> lies, than you appear to do at pre&s;ent.</P>
