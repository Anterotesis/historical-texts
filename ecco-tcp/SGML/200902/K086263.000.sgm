<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS hi&s;torical Interlude is form'd upon the &s;ame plan that ROUSSEAU compo&s;ed his <HI>Pygmalion,</HI> which is a new &s;pecies of drama|tic Entertainment, con&s;i&s;ting of a Monologue that is often &s;u&s;pended by the interpo&s;ition of Mu&s;ic, which mu&s;t &s;ympathi&s;e with the pa&s;&s;ions and feel|ings of the per&s;onage who is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The following little drama was perform'd by Mi&s;s YOUNGE on her benefit night, and received from that celebrated actre&s;s all the &s;pirit and co|louring that excellence of acting can give. The
<PB N="vi" REF="4">mu&s;ic (the compo&s;ition of Mr. HOOK) was hap|pily adapted to the tendency of the poem.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is taken from a remakable incident in the life of MARGARET. That unfortunate QUEEN flying with her Son <Q>into a fore&s;t after the Battle of <HI>Hexbam,</HI> &s;aw a robber approach with his naked &s;word, and finding that &s;he had no means of e&s;cape, &s;he &s;uddenly embrac'd the re|&s;olution of tru&s;ting entirely for protection to his genero&s;ity. The man who&s;e humanity and ge|nerous &s;pirit had been ob&s;cured, not entirely lo&s;t by his vicious cour&s;e of life, was &s;truck with the &s;ingularity of the event, and charmed with
<PB N="vii" REF="5">the confidence repo&s;ed in him, and he vow'd not only to ab&s;tain from all injury again&s;t the Queen, but to devote him&s;elf intirely to her &s;afety and protection.
