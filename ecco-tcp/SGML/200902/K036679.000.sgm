Oh, what a delightful thing it is to be quality!&mdash;But I wonder Mr. Cha|peau is not up yet, he does not u&s;e to be &s;o

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>St. James's dial, Sir, is not as con&s;tant to the &s;un, as I am to my cour&s;e of life. But how comes it that you are dre&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;oon, are you going to dine with any of your patroniz|ing attorneys in Chancery-Lane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I dine at this end of the town, but I have bu&s;ine&s;e on my hands&mdash;bu&s;ine&s;s which perhaps may occa&s;ion bu&s;ine&s;s for my pa|tronizing attorneys, as you are plea&s;ed to call them. In &s;hort, George, I am upon the brink of matrimoney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Why that's the very bu&s;ine&s;s I was wanting to open to you. I have thoughts of marrying too&mdash;In &s;hort, Harry, &s;uch is my &s;ituation at pre&s;ent that formidable as it may be, I mu&s;t marry, I mu&s;t find out a wife, who&s;e fortune may &s;et me afloat again, for faith, as matters go, I am &s;inking very fa&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the que&s;tion is, where will you find one that can an&s;wer your purpo&s;e, I am &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t be hand&s;ome or you will never like

<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In both the&s;e points, Harry, I have been lucky enough to &s;ucceed&mdash;During the cour&s;e of my &s;auntring duty in the Park, with the nur&s;ery maids, I met with a very fine girl, who has a con&s;iderable fortune in her own po|wer, but may expect a much greater if, &s;he marries with the con&s;ent of the old folks&mdash;of them I know nothing&mdash;The young thing is entirely mine&mdash;and I am fooli&s;h enough to be in love with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There you mu&s;t excu&s;e me&mdash;I mu&s;t be &s;urer of carrying my point, before I open my|&s;elf farther, even to you&mdash;But what, pray, is your &s;ituation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, odd enough, you will &s;ay. You have always laughed at me for &s;ticking, &s;o clo&s;e to the old ladies, but at la&s;t I am re|warded for it. One I have often &s;een at Lady Matchem's a&s;&s;emblies, has taken, it &s;eems, so violent an inclination to me, that &s;he has
<PB N="16" REF="19">made me an offer of her daughter&mdash;Tis true I am not acquainted with the girl, I have only &s;een her at a di&s;tance, but &s;he is reckoned hand|&s;ome, and as I am &s;ure her fortune has num|berle&s;s charms, I have made up my mind and am re&s;olved.</P>

<P>Sir, I have the honour to call my&s;elf Bevil.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir, I'll explain this my&s;tery: We are brothers; we have all been &s;o clo&s;e in this
<PB N="52" REF="55" MS="y">bu&s;ine&s;s that we have unavoidably ran counter to one another&mdash;and as George &s;eems to have plann'd his operations with more propriety than we did, and made &s;ure of the lady's affec|tions, with plea&s;ure I &s;hall quit the field, and bow to his &s;uperior merit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear George, you know me too well too doubt of my being in the &s;ame &s;entiments.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, what do you think of this bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I think, my dear, that as we can't help our&s;elves, we may as well make the be&s;t on't. What's done can't be undone, and it's well it's no wor&s;e, as was always the &s;aying of my poor dear brother, Sir Tympany.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRUB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad I believe he was right, and I may as well make the be&s;t on't; for if I don't give' her away, &s;he'll throw her&s;elf away. But I hope you won't follow the example of the great; there is &s;uch work among them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. BEVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, don't nouri&s;h &s;uch &s;trange preju|dices. The great have their follies, tis true, but they have al&s;o their virtues, as well as the re&s;t of mankind; and there are among them many &s;hining objects of inmitation: we &s;hould con&s;ider, Sir, that the Greate&s;t Couple in the nation is the be&s;t and happie&s;t in it.</P>
