<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t publication of the late Earl of CHESTERFIELD'S Let|ters, to the pre&s;ent time, the arrows of Cen&s;ure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate, from every quarter: the wit hath had his joke, the ver&s;ifier his parody, the morali&s;t his oppo&s;ing &s;entiment, and the di|vine
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
his grave di&s;&s;ertation. Very in|genious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his Lord&s;hip: his Graces have been &s;martly ridiculed; his etiquette humorou&s;ly expo&s;ed; and Mr. HUNTER, with an elegance and profundity far beyond the re&s;t of his remarkers, hath penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims, traver&s;ed him through every double, and examined his whole &s;y&s;tem with an analytical acutene&s;s.</P>
<P>It is matter of real amazement that among&s;t all tho&s;e who have ex|pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves loudly and dia|metrically again&s;t the doctrine of
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
Lord CHESTERFIELD'S corre&s;pon|dence, none &s;hould have yet thought of the only method that was mo&s;t likely to manife&s;t their tendency. The general &s;tigma upon the&s;e Let|ters has been, that they are calcu|lated to recommend deceit, and to conceal the mo&s;t de&s;tructive hypo|cri&s;y, under the &s;miling a&s;pect, plau|&s;ible exterior, fair-&s;eeming &s;enti|ments, and a complacent flexibility.</P>
<P>In an age of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, it is mo&s;t obvious to apprehen&s;ion, that maxims, like the&s;e, would have mo&s;t weight with the young and di&s;&s;ipated. The man of fa&s;hion
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
would find them &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with his plan of &s;ecurity, that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them; and the man of expe|dient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which, without either danger of his neck, or character, might repair his pur&s;e, promote his plea&s;ures, and &s;ave him from a thou&s;and &s;hocks that poverty is heir to.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ence of my Lord CHES|TERFIELD'S &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to be neither more nor le&s;s than this: Secure your&s;elf from being bla&s;ted, as he terms it, and do whatever
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
you think proper: whatever fancy, pa&s;&s;ion, whim, or wickedne&s;s, &s;ug|ge&s;t, only command your counte|nance, check your temper, and throw before your heart and bo&s;om the &s;hield of Di&s;&s;imulation, and &s;natch it&mdash;&s;eize it&mdash;enjoy it.</P>
<P>In regard to women&mdash;never &s;urely i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s a collection of hints &s;o capable of being turned to their de&s;truction: and the &s;ex ought to be more alarmed at this publica|tion (which, however, one of their own &s;ex has u&s;hered into the world) than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind, or purity of character.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8">How, then, hath it happened, that no per&s;on hath yet put the volumes of the Earl of CHESTER|FIELD into the hand of a hero, who, with a natural aptitude to en|joy every thing within his ob&s;erva|tion, might increa&s;e his felicity very con&s;iderably, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;entiments &s;o admirably &s;uited to multiply mi&s;chief, and to en&s;ure his victory over that &s;implicity, that beauty, and that &s;oftne&s;s, which, would, thence, be, &s;o much the more ea&s;ily, <HI>thrown off their guard.</HI></P>
<P>As nothing of this kind, how|ever, has appeared, I have ventured
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
to pre&s;ent to the public, the adven|tures of a man of birth, rank, fi|gure, and character, ardent in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ures, and much de|lighted <HI>with,</HI> and attracted <HI>by,</HI> the theory of Lord CHESTERFIELD. He purcha&s;es the books, finds them agreeable to his palate, &s;tudies them paragraph by paragraph, thrives under his application, piques him|&s;elf upon his progre&s;s; and in the end, a ma&s;ter of his &s;cience, in|vokes the genius of his noble pre|ceptor, puts money in his pur&s;e, the ine&s;timable volumes in his port|manteau, and &s;allies into the gay world, armed at all points, the PUPIL OF PLEASURE.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="10">Every ingenious precept laid down by the noble Lord, this high-bred young gentleman reduces to prac|tice, who, taking the &s;ummer before him, makes his attacks at a place of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort; where (fixing with commendable and pre-in|&s;tructed acutene&s;s upon proper ob|jects) he begins to exemplify, and is as &s;ucce&s;sful as the polite&s;t ca&s;ui&s;t could po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this hi&s;torical il|lu&s;tration&mdash;this biographical com|mentary on the text of CHESTER|FIELD&mdash;ample &s;cope has been al|lowed for the di&s;play of various characters, and particularly &s;uch as
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
more immediately promoted the main de&s;ign of the work, which is, to &s;hew the aggravated evils in &s;o|ciety ari&s;ing from the practice of &s;uch <HI>perniciou&s;ly-plea&s;ing precepts.</HI></P>
<P>To this end, I have made great u&s;e of the noble Lord's maxims, rules, and admonitions, upon va|rious &s;ubjects. The incidents, it is conceived, ari&s;e, naturally, out of the principles that produce them; the contra&s;t in the characters, e&s;pe|cially of HOMESPUN, SEDLEY, THORNTON, Lieutenant VERNON, and Sir HENRY DELMORE, I have endeavoured to render eminent and
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
con&s;picuous; and altho', &s;ome may think, the cata&s;trophe and a few of the circum&s;tances, carried too far into the pathetic, yet, I am per|&s;uaded, tho&s;e who weigh deeply the <HI>precepts</HI> of Lord CHESTERFIELD, will agree with me in thinking, that, if pu&s;hed into <HI>practice</HI> by an adventurer, like that which his Lord&s;hip <HI>would</HI> have formed out of Mr. STANHOPE, &s;imilar or even greater &s;orrows, and vices, would invade the community. In &s;hort, this hi&s;tory is calculated &s;trongly to prove the truth of Lord CHESTER|FIELD'S <HI>own</HI> ob&s;ervation, namely, "That the adoption of Vice is
<PB N="xv" REF="13">
likely to ruin ten times more young men, than natural inclination."</P>
<P>I am apt to think Mr. STAN|HOPE'S reputed want of <HI>ability</HI> made him die an hone&s;t, though an un|di&s;tingui&s;hed man: perhaps, if he had had <HI>Ton</HI> enough to follow the advice of his father, and entered into all the <HI>elevated connexions</HI> re|commended to him, he had fallen, like the hero of this hi&s;tory, equally celebrated, dazzling, and diabolical.</P>

<P>THE whirl of wheels, a fine flow of &s;pirits, the ely&s;ium of expectation, and the vigour of fre&s;h hor&s;es at every &s;tage, brought me, in le&s;s than twenty hours, from Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare to the place of date. Having no unnece&s;&s;ary luggage

to retard me, no trifling petit maitre, who, at two miles di&s;tance from the &s;hifting-place, drives back for his gloves, his cane, his &s;nuff-box, or his white handkerchief; I rolled, THORNTON, on the &s;prings of expedition; and I &s;it down, un&s;ubdued by fatigue, to tell thee of my &s;afety.</P>
<P>Richard&s;on's a child, his Grandi&s;on is a mon&s;ter, his Lovelace a bungler:&mdash; &s;ince the days of Adam, Nature hath pro|duced but <HI>one man of plea&s;ure;</HI> and that wonder was re&s;erved to adorn the age be|fore us.</P>
<P>Oh, CHESTERFIELD!

thy genius, to practi&s;e thy precepts, to hit, with a felicity like thine, the true &s;pirit of di&s;&s;imulation&mdash;&s;often my features to the blandi&s;hments of delight&mdash; attune my tongue to the thrillings of per&s;ua&s;ion&mdash; enrich my &s;entiments with &s;o ver&s;atile a ductility, that I may obey the occa&s;ions of the minute&mdash;endue me with per&s;eve|rance of &s;oul, and conde&s;cend to guide me (with all thy attendant graces; a&s;&s;i|duities, and elegant attentions,) into the bo&s;om of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, my Friend, my Mentor, my Genius, and my God!</P>
<P>THORNTON, I am in&s;pired! the rhap|&s;ody of my invocation is throbbing al|ready at my heart&mdash;it is working its way to the very marrow in the bones. The divine Letters of our Earl are this in&s;tant brought in by the po&s;tilion, who is un|con&s;cious of the trea&s;ure with which he is freighted; and I dare not proceed till I

<HEAD><HI>LETTER III. SEDLEY</HI> to <HI>THORNTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DULL THORNTON!&mdash;circum|&s;pect citizen! at what art thou alarmed, and "why is thy &s;pirit troubled within thee?" How can&s;t thou entertain &s;o contemptible a notion of thy SEDLEY? <HI>Imitation!</HI> Cur&s;e thee for the thought Ha&s;t thou, in the cour&s;e of &s;even enter|prizing years, ever known me &s;toop from the originality of <HI>&s;elf</HI> to the &s;lavery of another? 'Tis true, I admire the Lord of CHESTERFIELD: his epi&s;tles are, in the reading hour, always in my hand; at night they repo&s;e behind my pillow, and they at pre&s;ent con&s;titute all my tra|velling library. But I &s;corn to be fet|tered,
<PB N="7" REF="20">
either in body or &s;oul. The li|berty of the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> is as dear to me as the liberty of the <HI>per&s;on;</HI> and I have too much pride, too much dignity, to become a plagiary. No, THORNTON, the Earl is, as it were, my tutor; his &s;entiments are &s;uch as I have long felt, but &s;uch as, till now, I was cautious of <HI>avowing.</HI> Hitherto I have been re&s;trained in my actions, and lo&s;t half the joy of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, nobody had either reputation or ingenuity enough to keep me in countenance. I &s;wam the &s;tream of plea&s;ure, but was always afraid of going out of my depth. For the herd of men are contented to be libertines in the ordinary &s;hallow way, and, before the appearance of the&s;e <HI>enchanting Letters,</HI> we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity, to give credit to the efforts of an enterprizing &s;pirit. But <HI>now</HI> the im|pediment is removed,&mdash;the avenue is
<PB N="8" REF="21">
opened, and the pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure is palpable. The repo&s;itory of STANHOPE, the cabinet of CHESTERFIELD, the Earl's arcanum, are all di&s;clo&s;ed:&mdash;EUGENIA&mdash; bear, bear the name, ye ro&s;y-winged deities of joy, in gratitude to heaven!&mdash;EUGENIA has given to mankind the invaluable re|mains of her father, and in that pre&s;ent &mdash;(Oh, THORNTON, echo EUGENIA!)&mdash; hath di&s;covered, to every elegant character, fre&s;h roads to the temple of felicity, and virgin, unta&s;ted re&s;ources of per&s;onal ex|tacy.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign then, is to indulge my prin|ciples, by improving upon tho&s;e maxims which his elegant pen hath made <HI>fa&s;hion|able.</HI> Let others content them&s;elves with the <HI>vulgar</HI> happine&s;s of yielding beauty, entrapt &s;implicity, and the mere deflora|tion of female youth,&mdash;<HI>I</HI> cannot be cir|cum&s;cribed by &s;uch common, <HI>animal</HI> &s;en|&s;ations:
<PB N="9" REF="22">
&mdash;give me delicacy, give me diffi|culty, give me refinement,&mdash;give me in|novation,&mdash;or take from me exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>"To beat the beaten track,&mdash;to ta&s;te the ta&s;ted,"&mdash;Oh, &s;hocking!&mdash;in&s;up|portable! I am above it. I &s;corn it.</P>
<P>In a word then, THORNTON, what our GARRICK is to SHAKESPEARE, I am re|&s;olved to be to CHESTERFIELD,&mdash;the living comment upon the dead text. The youth to whom the Earl's Letters were originally addre&s;&s;ed, thou knowe&s;t, is dead; and it &s;hould &s;eem that he wanted <HI>&s;oul</HI> to reli&s;h them, had he continued among&s;t us. Peace to his uncongenial manes! I claim the inheritance, THORNTON, and de&s;ire you will con&s;ider <HI>me</HI> as his &s;on, by the adoption of his <HI>&s;entiment.</HI> Nay, had the&s;e veins been filled with the rich &s;tream
<PB N="10" REF="23">
that fed the heart of STANHOPE, I could not have been more like him&s;elf.&mdash;God forgive me! but, were it not &s;aid that my mother was the Diana of her day, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect &s;he played my father the Alderman fal&s;e, and that &s;he threw her|&s;elf into the conquering and accompli&s;hed arms of CHESTERFIELD.&mdash;Earth and &s;kies! Mr. THORNTON, can&s;t thou think I was the product of a plethoric Alder|man, and that Alderman a dealer in hops? &mdash;Ba&s;tardize me, dear friend, in pity to my feelings; and rather than &s;uppo&s;e me the offspring of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a conjunction, make me the by-blow of &s;ome deity in di&s;gui&s;e, and let me catch a ray of comfort from illegitimacy.</P>

<P>THE Earl's ab&s;ent man has al|ready exhibited him&s;elf. He is of the name of HOMESPUN, and is the butt of the bath. His &s;oul is contemplative, and his body pedantic. Never &s;aw I &s;o per|pendicular, or thoughtful a figure: a very walking &s;oliloquy; and his wife, or, at lea&s;t, the beautiful She who hangs upon his arm&mdash;O THORNTON! THORNTON! &mdash;I have an object before me already, young, elegant, graceful, and (I warmly hope) a <HI>wife</HI>&mdash;If &s;he &s;hould prove indeed the property of this pedant&mdash;if the &s;tars &s;hould have thrown a <HI>hoop of gold</HI> in my way, my fortune is made.&mdash;Soft a little

&mdash;my landlord enters&mdash;his eye looks com|munication&mdash;there is intelligence in every feature. I am po&s;itive he will prove the <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er</HI> of the bath.</P>
<P>Pray, Mr.&mdash;I forget your name&mdash; Mr.&mdash; Wyngood is my name, Sir.&mdash; Pray, Mr. Wyngood, what fine young lady is that now walking with the &s;traight, well-made gentleman in raven-grey?</P>
<P>She is wife to the gentleman, Sir; and his name is Mr. HORACE HOMES|PUN, a mini&s;ter come to bathe for the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> di&s;order. There's a <HI>va&s;t</HI> deal of company, Sir, in town, and I think you are very lucky in taking my lodgings. I have got the be&s;t lodgings in all BUX|TON, and &s;ome of the be&s;t people in them at this moment. Why now, Sir, you would not think it, but I can &s;hew you &s;uch things as will &s;urprize you.&mdash;Here
<PB N="14" REF="27">
he &s;et off, and I followed him into a bed|chamber, where, without any ceremony, opening the drawers of his lodgers, he took out a riding-hat, with a blue feather and a &s;pangled button. "Lookee, Sir, did you ever &s;ee the like? Then here is &s;ilks upon &s;attins, and &s;attins upon &s;ilks; and they're the <HI>kinde&s;t</HI> people in the world. They live as cheap as po&s;&s;ible. Why I don't &s;uppo&s;e, one day with another, they &s;pend a guinea; they pay only eight-pence a-piece for breakfa&s;t, a &s;hilling a-piece for dinner, eight-pence for tea in the afternoon, a &s;hilling each for &s;upper, and fourteen &s;hillings for lodging; be&s;ides wa&s;hing, coals, candles, and wines,&mdash;a <HI>mere nothing,</HI> as I may &s;ay, for a watering-place. I pre&s;ume, Sir, you would chu&s;e to join them, and live in the &s;ame manner. I &s;ee you are a very worthy gentleman, and I will go mention you under the name of &mdash; pray, what name mu&s;t I &s;ay, Sir?
<PB N="15" REF="28">
&mdash; But no matter; I will tell Mr. HOMESPUN that a new lodger wi&s;hes to do as he does. Sir, your &s;ervant; I will be with you again pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The fellow had it all his own way, THORNTON. I interrupted him not, and am this very night to &s;up with ma&s;ter mini&s;ter HOMESPUN. I have walked down to the well, and drank a gla&s;s at this Helicon of health. I was in this ramble the man of fa&s;hion, ju&s;t &s;tept out of the chai&s;e, and elegantly di&s;ordered in my dre&s;s&mdash;my hair was tied with negligence, my curls loo&s;e and in the <HI>ton</HI> of con|fu&s;ion, and my frock di&s;covered a genteel &s;hape and the cut of a good taylor. A mi&s;cellaneous group were pa&s;&s;ing away the intermediate hours betwixt tea-time and &s;upper: the lame and the lazy, the merry and the mortified, were all upon the &s;aun|ter: HOMESPUN was fondly ruminating
<PB N="16" REF="29">
with his angelic con&s;ort in the &s;hade; and <HI>&s;omething</HI> that had the appearance of a fop&mdash;I mean of the common kind&mdash;was &s;aying &s;mart things to a pretty well-woman.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, could induce me to &s;tay a moment at this dull place, but the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>precepts</HI> which will convert all places into a paradi&s;e, and make even a <HI>watering-place</HI> delicious.&mdash;I am &s;um|moned by the &s;upper-bell.&mdash;Mrs. HOME|SPUN&mdash;Oh, what a name for &s;uch a crea|ture!&mdash;is tripping it towards the &s;ound, and HOMESPUN him&s;elf &s;eems to forget his primitive uprightne&s;s of back, and &s;teps bri&s;kly forward.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> From the Reverend <HI>HORACE HOMESPUN</HI> to Doctor <HI>DIGGORY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU remember, I pre&s;ume, the jaunt I took in the la&s;t year to SOUTH|AMPTON, the particulars of which, at the reque&s;t of &s;ome friends, I &s;uffered to be printed in the WESTMINSTER MAGAZINE, in two &s;everal letters addre&s;&s;ed to the publi&s;her, Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT, of E&s;&s;ex-&s;treet, in the Strand, London. I there told you, that I was not quite &s;o highly intere&s;ted in, or entertained by, the &s;cenes in a hurry before me, as my <HI>then</HI> patron, the Baronet, would flatter my
<PB N="22" REF="35">
imagination with upon the road; and (as I find tho&s;e letters from the We&s;tmin&s;ter Magazine were reprinted into various <HI>other</HI> monthly publications) I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e my excur&s;ion afforded &s;ome amu&s;e|ment to a certain &s;et of readers.</P>
<P>But, having &s;ince then been yoked to a dam&s;el who hath a pa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e wa|tering-places, and who (bringing along with her a decent fortune) has a right to indulge her&s;elf in &s;uch amu&s;ements as &s;eem be&s;t unto her, I have a <HI>&s;econd</HI> op|portunity to &s;urvey the cu&s;toms and man|ners of water-drinkers and duckers; and can now give you many curious particu|lars by way of &s;upplement to the accounts I have already publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>As my pre&s;ent cure is &s;ituated about thirty-&s;even po&s;t miles and a quarter from the waters of BUXTON, amid&s;t the won|ders
<PB N="23" REF="36">
of the Peake, Mrs. HOMESPUN cho&s;e to pa&s;s a week at that place, for the be|nefit of a pain in the ancle, which be|came grievous about &s;ix minutes before &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted to me the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the cure of her ancle might be perfectly completed, I contrived it &s;o, as to per&s;uade the curate of a neighbouring pari&s;h to do duty at home in my ab&s;ence, and re&s;olved to &s;tay a fortnight. Of this fortnight only four days are yet expired; and though I never underwent the &s;ame degree of parade, of fatigue, and of im|pertinence, in any former fourteen years of my life,&mdash;not even when I preached thrice in the Sunday, and footed it to two of the cures,&mdash;yet HARRIET &s;eems &s;o happy in <HI>doing as others do,</HI> and finds &s;uch real felicity in the dulle&s;t &s;pot I ever beheld, that I am in doubt whether even
<PB N="24" REF="37">
the long re&s;idue of the fortnight will &s;a|tisfy her, &s;o as to return home, to peace, privacy, and the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, without murmurings and repinings.</P>
<P>Oh! Doctor, &s;ee the outlines of my &s;ituation, and pity me. I am among&s;t a number of both &s;exes who&s;e plea&s;ures are my aver&s;ions, and who&s;e amu&s;ements I cannot reli&s;h. I love quietne&s;s and the &s;hade of life, and yet the hou&s;e where I now lodge is as public as an inn at a fair. I admire rural ornaments, and &s;cenes of &s;ummer verdure beyond imagination; and yet the mountains of Arabia De&s;erta ex|hibit not a pro&s;pect &s;o barren as that by which BUXTON is bounded. I love to &s;troll into the &s;hop of an intelligent book|&s;eller, and to conver&s;e with him upon the topic of recent publications;&mdash;alas! the book&s;eller of BUXTON has nothing in his &s;hop but the tra&s;h that circulates at a
<PB N="25" REF="38">
watering-place among&s;t the women. I ran my eye over his catalogue, and never did I &s;ee &s;uch a collection: Clelia, Pamela, the Adventures of Cleopatra, Amu&s;ements at the German Spa, and the Hi&s;tory of an Actre&s;s, were the be&s;t, in this bad bundle.</P>
<P>I mentioned the Reviews&mdash;no body called for <HI>them.</HI> I talked of the Maga|zines&mdash;none were ordered. I rummaged every row for <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI>&mdash;nobody reads philo&s;ophy at a watering-place. I criti|ci&s;ed the &s;helves for <HI>morals,</HI> but found them not. I ventured to a&s;k, but with &s;ome little he&s;itation, for Secker's Lec|tures&mdash;the book&s;eller never heard of them. I took a turn round the &s;hop, and (having forgot to bring any books with me) would have taken up with almo&s;t any-thing <HI>ap|proaching</HI> to the rational, but, in my pro|gre&s;s, I had well-nigh over&s;et a gla&s;s-ca&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="39">
of toothpicks, gold hu&s;&s;ives, embroidered pincu&s;hions, and embo&s;&s;ed &s;nuff-boxes.</P>
<P>And now it appeared, that this harle|quin trader was rather a haberda&s;her, than a book&s;eller.</P>
<P>On ca&s;ting my eyes towards a per&s;on at the other end of the &s;hop, I &s;aw her bending wire, to form, what is facetiou&s;ly called, a cap: over this per&s;on's head was a goodly &s;how of bandboxes; and acro&s;s the window at which &s;he &s;at, were ribbons variou&s;ly twi&s;ted, and &s;everal &s;pecimens of her &s;kill in decorating that part of the body which is <HI>now</HI> more ridiculous than any other. Seeing &s;uch preparations for the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of the head, I gave up the idea of finding any <HI>internal</HI> furniture; and, walking out of the &s;hop, a&s;ked pardon for having &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;taken a milliner's and toyman's, for a vender of matters in
<PB N="27" REF="40">
the literary way.&mdash;Ju&s;t as I got to the door, a party of mighty pretty women, and my wife among&s;t the re&s;t, (for <HI>&s;he</HI> already knew every body,) came ru&s;tling into the &s;hop, and in a li&s;ping tone, at|tuned to the articulation of a watering-place, de&s;ired the haberda&s;hery-millinery book&s;eller to look for JULIA MANDEVILLE &mdash;Julia Mandeville was not to be had. Then let us have SIDNEY BIDDULPH, &s;aid the ladies &mdash; Sidney Biddulph was out. I'm for, THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART, cried a very grave-looking woman. I wi&s;h, my dear, (&s;aid my wife to me, with a very well-bred civility, taking le&s;s no|tice of me than u&s;ual,) you had brought JOSEPH ANDREWS along with you&mdash; Oh la! Ma'am, replied another, how can you po&s;&s;ibly read &s;uch <HI>low</HI> &s;tuff&mdash;the ad|ventures of a footman, a kitchin wench, and a &s;trolling par&s;on&mdash;Nay, Madam, &s;aid HARRIET, don't &s;ay any-thing again&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="41">
the par&s;ons, pray; remember I'm a cler|gyman's wife, and there he &s;tands&mdash;an ABRAHAM ADAMS every inch of him&mdash; a'n't you, my dear?</P>
<P>This was too much; I attempted to go, but HARRIET caught me by the coat. The poor ladies were in great anxiety to find THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART had been carried off la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, by a per&s;on who took the road to GRETNA GREEN with her footman, in her way to London; though &s;ome (&s;aid the haber|da&s;her archly) may think <HI>that</HI> was going a round-about way too. If we can't get THE MISTAKES, &s;uppo&s;e, rejoined the ladies, we make &s;hift, till we can have &s;omething <HI>better,</HI> with TOM JONES&mdash;Aye, TOM JONES is tolerable enough, (&s;aid a pale lady,) if he would but &s;ay more about SOPHIA, and give us le&s;s non|&s;en&s;e about the old vulgar father, the
<PB N="29" REF="42">
fu&s;ty aunt, and tho&s;e unentertaining hor|rid creatures, THWACKUM and SQUARE. As to his Introductory Chapters, as he calls them, I always &s;kip 'em; and yet, if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were to expect, at the top of his chapters, I really think it would be a <HI>goodi&s;h, prettyi&s;h</HI> &s;ort of a novel. &mdash; Tom Jones, it &s;eems, was now in read|ing by Lady Sallow's coachman.&mdash;The haberda&s;her recommended FILIAL PIETY &mdash;the ladies were &s;atisfied that it was a dull, &s;erious, &s;ermonizing thing, from the title. FILIAL PIETY indeed!&mdash;&s;end it to Mi&s;s Dorothy De&s;olate, who is come to dip for the di&s;mals; or Lady Bab. Bluebutter, who wants to drink away her frog-freckled complexion.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! he! he! he.&mdash;</P>
<P>The laugh was now more violent than the wit was brilliant by which it was oc|ca&s;ioned,
<PB N="30" REF="43">
and my dear HARRIET, joined in it mo&s;t cordially.&mdash;They were about to depart without any books at all, when the haberda&s;her mentioned &s;ome odd vo|lumes of the Spectator. They a&s;ked what he meant by talking about &s;uch old things, which they had been <HI>obliged</HI> to read over and over again when they were at their boarding-&s;chools. Lord! (cried one of the dam&s;els,) here's DELICATE EMBAR|RASSMENTS&mdash;Oh! the very thing&mdash;worth all the Spectators that ever were <HI>wrote.</HI> Aye, take it, and let us go read it di|rectly&mdash;It don't <HI>end well</HI> I think, objected another; I had rather read EACH SEX IN THEIR HUMOUR.&mdash;Here is <HI>Something New,</HI> ladies, &s;aid the haberda&s;her&mdash;As old as the poles, &s;aid the fair-ones.&mdash;What &s;ay you to ELOISA?&mdash;Oh! by all means&mdash; Have you got ELOISA?&mdash;reach it this mo|ment&mdash;Oh, the dear book!&mdash;there are <HI>three</HI> letters in the fir&s;t volume worth all

the world.&mdash;Come, it's a na&s;ty evening and not fit for walking, let us hurry away; and &s;o &s;end them, Mr TRASHLEY, to <HI>the Hall</HI> this in&s;tant. Come, Mr. HOMESPUN, (turning to me,) you &s;hall <HI>'&s;quire</HI> us.</P>
<P>They fluttered out, caught me by the arm, and carried me off in high triumph, ten times fa&s;ter than I &s;hould have walked, had I been permitted to do as I thought proper. But that is a matter by no means allowable, at a watering-place. Even now I am &s;ummoned by a me&s;&s;enger, who &s;ays <HI>the party</HI> are waiting for me, to go into the walks. I dare not &s;tay to fini&s;h my letter, le&s;t I &s;hould become <HI>ridiculous;</HI> &s;o you mu&s;t wait till I can next &s;teal a mo|ment <HI>from</HI> folly <HI>for</HI> friend&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER IX. SEDLEY</HI> to <HI>THORNTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OH! for the genius of old HO|RATIUS FLACCUS, that I might compre&s;s a volume of facts within the foldings of a &s;ingle &s;heet of paper! Hear, &s;ee, be convinced, congratulate me, and &s;ing a <HI>Te Deum</HI> to thy friend, and a requiem to the immortal memory of STANHOPE.</P>
<P>The party, of which I was made one, con&s;i&s;ted of ma&s;ter mini&s;ter HOMESPUN, his lady, an animal who burle&s;qued the coxcomb, and a fourth who departed be|fore the entrance of &s;upper, &s;o that of him I &s;hall &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent.&mdash; HOMESPUN and his wife are oppo&s;ites,
<PB N="33" REF="46">
and therefore the better &s;uited to the trial of &s;kill. At fir&s;t I &s;aid no more than ju&s;t to &s;hew my breeding, and inclination to be happy in their &s;ociety. I let them &s;hew off <HI>them&s;elves</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, that I might accurately learn their tem|pers, before I ventured to attack them. HOMESPUN &s;oon di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a grubber in books; and his lady, a lover of the fa&s;hions; gay, giddy, good-natured, un&s;u&s;picious, and uninformed. The cox|comb was of the neutral kind, but wi&s;hed to be flattered, for his ta&s;te in per&s;onal or|naments. Never was there a more cu|rious trio. The conver&s;ation turned at fir&s;t upon weather, then upon books, then upon dre&s;s, and la&s;t upon the virtue of the BUXTON waters; and I accommodated my&s;elf to the &s;everal changes with tole|rable facility.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, to touch the tender part of
<PB N="34" REF="47">
our bookworm, I ob&s;erved that the public &s;u&s;tained a great lo&s;s in the death of &s;e|veral ornaments of the age. I &s;poke cri|tically, as to the &s;atiric powers of CHARLES CHURCHILL; and poetically, as to the Pindaric flights of GRAY. I entered into the intricacies of the epic, and drew the line betwixt the original HOMER and the imitator VIRGIL. I &s;poke of ea&s;e, in the &s;tyle of TILLOTSON; and of the pathetic, in the periods of YORICK. I affected even to di&s;countenance the innuendo of TRISTRAM SHANDY, and I compared his licentious &s;pirit with the voluptuous OVID. I pretended to di&s;cover an o&s;tentatious di&s;|play of talents in the Orations and Epi&s;tles of CICERO; and I took care to &s;uit every opinion to the ta&s;te of the per&s;on I ad|dre&s;&s;ed, who had his &s;hare in the conver|&s;ation too, and who (as I have &s;ince heard) mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="48">I mu&s;t not forget to tell thee, that, when I was talking upon books, and mentioned the ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM, Mrs. HOMESPUN (though no &s;impleton) a&s;ked me, with great &s;implicity, if that was a <HI>novel;</HI> to which the fop an&s;wered <HI>Yes,</HI> it came out la&s;t year, and was written by an intimate friend of his, but that, though <HI>he</HI> pu&s;hed it with all his intere&s;t, it did not <HI>take,</HI> and was now totally buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>I contradicted this with all po&s;&s;ible po|litene&s;s&mdash;<HI>I imagined he might be mi&s;taken:</HI> that work, <HI>I believed,</HI> was attributed to LORD KAMES&mdash;a writer, with whom I did <HI>not doubt</HI> but he was acquainted. Po&s;|&s;ibly he might confound the title a little, with others &s;imilar to it; which might very ea&s;ily be done. I had caught <HI>my&s;elf</HI> in &s;uch errors a thou&s;and times. Mr. HOMESPUN chuckled at my candour.
<PB N="36" REF="49">
Mrs. HOMESPUN (I know by her eyes) &s;aid &s;omething to her hu&s;band, in a low voice, in my favour; and the fop him|&s;elf, with a &s;mile of complacence, but without any confu&s;ion at detected ig|norance, (&mdash;&s;uch, THORNTON, is the force of <HI>manner!</HI>&mdash;) &s;aid, it was very likely he might be mi&s;led by the title; that there were three or four <HI>elements,</HI> and he was mo&s;t &s;uperlatively obliged to me for &s;etting him right.</P>
<P>Upon the topic of dre&s;s, I took care to agree with Mrs. HOMESPUN in every particular; except that, now and then, I affected, in a gentle tone of voice, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;mile of countenance, to differ from her, on purpo&s;e to throw the tri|umph on <HI>her</HI> &s;ide, make her happy in an ideal &s;uperiority, the better to impre&s;s her with a proper notion of my good manners, in yielding to conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="50">The fop hopped out about twelve o'clock, and took me by the hand in token of &s;atisfaction. Hone&s;t HORACE (that is his Chri&s;tian name) con&s;iders me as his comforter, and declares that he hopes for &s;ome happine&s;s now, even in a watering-place; and Mrs. HOMESPUN, or, as I &s;hall call her hereafter, (to u&s;e as little as po&s;&s;ible that vulgar name,) HARRIET, makes no &s;cruple of &s;aying, I am the mo&s;t chatty, agreeable man at the bath.</P>
<P>I caught her, THORNTON, twice mea|&s;uring me from top to bottom, and then &s;he gave HORACE a &s;urvey.&mdash;By the &s;oft, half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;igh &s;he gave at the end of it, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee&mdash;who&s;e dimen|&s;ions &s;he likes be&s;t.</P>
<P>Oh! THORNTON, if I can once bring her to be di&s;contented with her &s;ituation,
<PB N="38" REF="51">
&mdash;if &s;he once begins to repent of her bar|gain, the day is my own! I never &s;aw a pair of eyes more likely to fall in love than hers. The eyes of HORACE are grey, and without lu&s;tre. She hath the right lips of invitation: the vulgar HO|RACE &s;mackt them at &s;omething &s;he &s;aid, but methinks the impre&s;&s;ion was only <HI>&s;kin-deep.</HI> She is in full health, and in the hey-day of female youth!</P>
<P>Oh, THORNTON! THORNTON! pray earne&s;tly, that &s;he may be mi&s;erable, and that the de&s;pair of her heart may be re|moved, only by thy friend</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I REALLY begin to think, I &s;hall find &s;ome &s;atisfaction at BUXTON bath. Amid&s;t a clu&s;ter of in&s;ignificant characters, one gentleman has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o much above the re&s;t, that I have at once gratified my pride and curio&s;ity in his acquaintance.</P>
<P>He is intimately acquainted with polite and elegant learning, perfectly well man|nered, and not above conver&s;ing upon

&s;ubjects of divinity, and ethics, even at a <HI>watering-place.</HI> My wife &s;ays, he un|der&s;tands to a nicety, what &s;ome of the waterers call the ETIQUETTE of dre&s;s; and with the arts of a &s;cholar, he has, it &s;eems, the invention and ta&s;te of a cour|tier, without any-thing of courtly in&s;in|cerity.</P>
<P>In truth, I am apt to think very fa|vourably of him, e&s;pecially as his exte|rior does not &s;eem more frank and open, than his interior is ingenuous and undi&s;|gui&s;ed. <HI>One</HI> &s;uch character will atone for the &s;tupidity of the <HI>re&s;t.</HI> As I am fond of, now and then, what I call a wood-walk, or a ramble by my&s;elf, I can now take <HI>this</HI> without a breach of good manners, for I can leave this accompli&s;hed gentleman with HARRIET, who is fond enough of his company to accept of him in <HI>my</HI> ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>OH, that I could live at BUX|TON for ever!

<P>'Tis hardly worth attending to, and perhaps you'll laugh at my taking <HI>notice</HI> of &s;uch a trifle, but he &s;its in a chair, eats his victuals, cuts it into &s;lices, and holds his knife and fork as different from HORACE as po&s;&s;ible, who, you know, &s;ometimes &s;eems &s;o over head and ears in thought, that he forgets the dinner is be|fore him, picks his teeth, and &s;its &s;ilent, till the cloth is ready to be taken away. Then again, as to carving, HORACE can no more do the honours, of the table than a baby: he <HI>mi&s;&s;es the joint,</HI> and &s;ome|times &s;catters the &s;auce in ones face;&mdash; whereas <HI>this</HI> gentleman, hits the mark as dexterou&s;ly as a &s;urgeon, helps the ladies to the greate&s;t delicacies, with &s;uch a gentle manner, and with a countenance

<P>At &s;upper la&s;t night, HORACE was in one of his thoughtful moods, and di&s;|gu&s;ted me horridly.</P>
<P>There was a roa&s;ted fowl; and HO|RACE, perceiving my plate empty, mu&s;t needs fill it with one of the wings, which he made &s;hift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating, though another for the purpo&s;e was lying on the other &s;ide the di&s;h. Then he mu&s;t needs make my wing &s;wim with the gravy, and, in awkwardly tilting the di&s;h, &s;everal drops flew upon the gentleman's wai&s;tcoat.

<P>THE proverb is verified: It can|not rain, but it pours! The Cherubim I mentioned to thee in my la&s;t, is a che|rub of an inferior order, when compared with the SERAPH who came with her. She was at <HI>that</HI> time muffled up and clo&s;e hooded; but when, on the next day, the veil was withdrawn, judge of my &s;ur|prize, when I beheld the very <HI>She,</HI> the charming <HI>She,</HI> whom la&s;t &s;ea&s;on I met with her father, Sir HENRY DELMORE, at SCARBOROUGH, at the very period, that the letters, of my <HI>divine Earl</HI> became popular, and I had brought a copy of them. We lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e,
<PB N="62" REF="75">
and I became agreeable to Sir HENRY. The very fir&s;t trial I made to reduce my favourite precepts to practice, was upon the heart of this very girl, then glowing with all the graces of health, and en|dowed with all the enchantments of a <HI>pathetic</HI> temper. I &s;oon pretended to lo&s;e <HI>my</HI> vivacity, and became the &s;ofte&s;t &s;on of &s;entiment that ever was born. The net of &s;ilk, which I had diligently woven, became &s;ucce&s;sful; and I had certainly caught in it the faire&s;t prize in the crea|tion, had not a cruel nece&s;&s;ity called me from the bath.</P>
<P>Several tran&s;ient tete-a-tetes I Had with her there, gave me the opportunities I wi&s;hed. Her pa&s;&s;ion was imaginary, but plea&s;ing&mdash;&s;he fixed high the &s;tandard of dome&s;tic felicity, and unrea&s;onably loved to refine.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="76">To accommodate my&s;elf to <HI>this,</HI> was, at fir&s;t, not ea&s;y; but before I quitted SCARBOROUGH, I was &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for the <HI>pen&s;eno&s;o,</HI> that even Sir HENRY him|&s;elf, began to think I was falling into a hypochondriac di&s;order, and u&s;ed every effort to divert me.</P>
<P>Though I was then but a novice in the theory of joy, I had read enough of CHESTERFIELD to know the potency of <HI>di&s;&s;imulation;</HI> and, had it been in my power to have &s;taid <HI>another week,</HI> &s;hould have, even <HI>then,</HI> added an illu&s;trious ex|ample, to corroborate that glorious pre|cept, which advi&s;es "to adapt the cha|racter and conver&s;ation to the company."</P>
<P>Since the&s;e tran&s;actions, &s;he is altered, THORNTON,&mdash;altered in every part of her &s;ituation: the is married, and in a con&s;umption; and yet, like certain fruits, &s;he

I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee her di&s;ordered at the fir&s;t interview: the little blood that painted her cheek, di&s;appeared, her knees &s;hook, and her hands trembled at the recollection. And this, too, was in a public breakfa&s;ting-room. Judge how her agitation mu&s;t alarm the company, and operate among&s;t the women in my favour. Who knows, THONRTON, but the beautiful invalid may have brought her&s;elf to this &s;tate, upon <HI>my</HI> account? If &s;o, ought not <HI>I</HI> to pity her?&mdash;and ought not <HI>&s;he</HI> to thank the gods, that I again "am come to comfort her?"

<P>No more, I prithee, as to plurality of objects.</P>
<P>The CHESTERFIELD &s;y&s;tem admits not the fearful and filthy intercour&s;e of <HI>venal</HI> women. <HI>He</HI> could not allow the horrid and vulgar hazards of c&mdash;s and p&mdash;s.

<P><PB N="80" REF="93">For the fir&s;t time in her life, &s;he found fault with every-thing I did. She in&s;i&s;ted upon it, I drank my tea <HI>too hot,</HI> which was not only, &s;he &s;aid, injurious to the coat of the &s;tomach, but &s;hockingly <HI>in|delicate.</HI></P>
<P>The tea-&s;poon was not managed to her &s;atisfaction. I &s;ipped too <HI>loud</HI> from the <HI>&s;aucer,</HI> when it would, I find, have been <HI>genteeler</HI> to apply a <HI>silent</HI> lip to the <HI>cup.</HI> Nay, what is wor&s;e than all this, I had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter <HI>ineligantly;</HI> and it would have been better there too, if I had put the <HI>ends,</HI> rather than die <HI>&s;ide</HI> of it, to my mouth fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But that which mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed me, was her objection to the good old cu&s;tom of <HI>turning down</HI> my cup, which &s;he &s;aid was out of the TON, and that it would
<PB N="81" REF="94">
give her great plea&s;ure, if, in future, I would lay the <HI>&s;poon acro&s;s</HI> the cup.</P>
<P>I was perfectly petrified, and yet <Q>held my tongue, and &s;pake nothing.</Q>&mdash;She propo&s;ed walking, and, as I really thought the air might do the poor creature's head good, I drew on my gloves, and attended her towards the well-walk.&mdash;Alas! Doc|tor, nothing, I fear, can bring her about; for &s;he grew ten times wor&s;e than ever, and if I was a&s;toni&s;hed before, I was now almo&s;t &s;truck dead with the hugene&s;s of my amazement.</P>
<P>I had not the happine&s;s to hit her fancy even in my walk, which &s;he very fairly told me, was <HI>ridiculous;</HI> and that I held up my head too high, turned <HI>in</HI> my toes too much, and wanted the <HI>Graces</HI> in my arms.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="95">She actually made an objection to the <HI>manner</HI> in which my wig was powdered, &s;aid it was all in patches, and had not the regular &s;prinkling of a man of fa|&s;hion.</P>
<P>Upon this, I ventured gently to tell her, that I was but a country curate, that I had no preten&s;ions to <HI>fa&s;hion</HI>&mdash;that I had, for my own part, nothing to do at watering-place, but to oblige her&mdash; that I was very &s;orry, for the loftine&s;s of my head, which, for the time to come, &s;hould be carried with more humility&mdash; that, if it would give her any plea&s;ure, I would take care to &s;toop till I bent neck and &s;houlders together&mdash;that, as to inver&s;ion of the toes, I would learn to dance, late in the day as it was for me, and incon&s;i&s;tent as &s;uch a part might be thought to the clerical character&mdash; in re|gard to my arms, that I had hitherto only
<PB N="83" REF="96">
u&s;ed them in the ordinary offices of life, and found they performed very well for a plain man; but that, if &s;he had any favourite attitudes, or wi&s;hed me to ex|hibit in any po&s;tures to which &s;he was particularly partial, I would practi&s;e vi|gilantly at the looking-gla&s;s, and, rather than want the <HI>Graces</HI> &s;he &s;poke of, would ab&s;olutely learn the exerci&s;e, and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs, arms, head, and hands, like a young recruit. At the &s;ame time I begged her to con&s;ider, that, as we had, &s;ince the day of our union, lived harmoniou&s;ly, I warmly hoped we &s;hould not be put out of tune by trifles, which are in them|&s;elves in&s;ignificant, even if we admitted them to be e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>etiquette</HI> of a watering-place. I, moreover, told her to remember, that I was at lea&s;t a <HI>faith|ful</HI> hu&s;band, and made her happine&s;s the &s;tudy, practice, and contrivance, of my
<PB N="84" REF="97">
whole life: and that, &s;urely, where the cardinal duties were ob&s;erved, it mattered little whether the toes were the breadth of a barley-corn too much in or out, or the head half an inch too lofty, or half an inch too low. I would have pro|ceeded in my defence, but that my good friend Mr. SEDLEY at that in&s;tant came to my relief, told us, <HI>as he advanced with warmth, vivacity and a chearful countenance, that,</HI> <Q>if we did ju&s;tice to his attachment to us, we might judge of the joy be felt in &s;eeing us &s;o fre|quently chu&s;e a private path, which was to him a certain indication of ma|trimonial felicity.</Q></P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o pretty in his &s;peech, that it made an impre&s;&s;ion on my memory, and I have copied it <HI>ver|batim.</HI> In le&s;s than half an hour, Mrs. HOMESPUN recovered her rea&s;on; her
<PB N="85" REF="98">
late lunacy was never hinted at, and, hoping to continue her good-nature, I invited this mo&s;t agreeable gentleman to take another bit of &s;upper with us.</P>
<P>The manner in which he accepted the invitation, trebled the &s;en&s;e of the fa|vour he did me by his company. What a gratification it is to have &s;o &s;en&s;ible and entertaining a friend at a watering-place!</P>

the heat; though, in truth, this is one of the colde&s;t places in England, and it had rained all the preceding evening. I felt her pul&s;e, and it was immoderately full, tumultuous, and rapid.

I pre&s;&s;ed to know the cau&s;e of this; at lea&s;t, to what &s;he attributed it; and of|fered to throw on my cloaths, and pro|cure a Doctor.

&s;he &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of get|ting out of the bed, and &s;it till the morning in a chair.

<P>CERTAINLY, Mr. SEDLEY is the be&s;t young man in England.

my fancy does not deceive me, he had &s;ome difficulty to prevent a tear from &s;tarting. He a&s;&s;ured me, that words were never made to do ju&s;tice to the feelings of wounded friend&s;hip; that he was more intere&s;ted in every-thing that concerned me and my wife, than he could expre&s;s; and that, if I would &s;ug|ge&s;t &s;ome little pretence, either of bu&s;i|ne&s;s or of invitation, to leave him with Mrs. HOMESPUN in the evening, he would certainly either comfort her by every mini&s;tration of the &s;incere&s;t friend|&s;hip, or, at wor&s;t, he would find out the rea&s;ons for her anxiety, and the na|ture of her complaint; after which, he very well ob&s;erved, the remedy would be ea&s;y.

<P>OH, CHARLOTTE! CHARLOTTE! what a perplexity am I thrown into, by this &s;cheme of plea&s;ure! Accur&s;ed be the hour in which I &s;et my foot upon the confines of BUXTON! Uncon&s;cious of any violent partialities, I was con|tented while I was ignorant. In the dreary village, where our par&s;onage is a <HI>palace,</HI> I was &s;ufficiently happy, becau&s;e I &s;aw nobody &s;uperior to Mr. HOMESPUN. I was the Mini&s;ter's lady, and the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood paid me the compliment of their be&s;t curt&s;ey. My HORACE really looked hand&s;ome in
<PB N="99" REF="112">
his Sunday canonicals, and I viewed him in the pulpit with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But, alas! my CHARLOTTE, the &s;cene is changed. I have been &s;everal days in a place of politene&s;s, where HORACE is the mo&s;t awkward of the circle. My eyes are now opened to his imperfections &mdash;I <HI>&s;ee</HI> them, I <HI>feel</HI> them, I <HI>dete&s;t</HI> them. He is a lump of learning, without duc|tility, without &s;oftne&s;s, without&mdash;what Mr. SEDLEY calls, <HI>the Graces.</HI> I am &s;ometimes obliged to a&s;k &s;everal times before I can obtain an an&s;wer to the mo&s;t ordinary que&s;tion, and then, at la&s;t, he bur&s;ts from his reverie, and pretends not to have heard me &s;peak to him. Can any-thing be &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting? His conver&s;ation is unlike that of the re&s;t of the company; and, in&s;tead of bearing a part, in little, &s;ocial, and endearing <HI>chit|chat,</HI> he talks eternally about Locke, and
<PB N="100" REF="113">
Livy, and Cicero, the Elements of Cri|tici&s;m, the Problems of Euclid, and &s;uch fellows&mdash;and many a time, when I have wanted him to put a pin in my hand|kerchief, or &s;uch little offices of endear|ment, he has been wrapt up in medita|tion, and then &s;tared me full in the face without knowing I was in the room.</P>
<P>Then, he actually has a &s;trange &s;hy method of treating me as a wife. There is no delicacy in his air, when he takes my hand: he &s;hakes it indeed HEARTILY, but then he has the fat fi&s;t of a gra&s;ier, even though in other re&s;pects he is di&s;|agreeably thin. He ki&s;&s;es, with a cere|mony perfectly cla&s;&s;ical, as Mr. SEDLEY calls it. There is a pretty method, me|thinks, even in the management of the lips. By <HI>accident,</HI> Mr. SEDLEY &s;tole a ki&s;s the other day, and he placed it, &s;o directly, &s;o gently, and &s;o pathetically in

<P>We were, I remember, playing at que&s;tions and commands, the day being &s;howery, &s;o that we could not &s;tir out. The forfeit came round at la&s;t to HO|RACE, and he &s;mackt me, as u&s;ual, in his round-about manner. Heaven par|don me, CHARLOTTE, but I was obliged to draw my pocket-handkerchief acro&s;s my mouth, and had &s;ome difficulty to avoid making a wry face. If you was once in the company of Mr. SEDLEY&mdash; he is called the <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> SEDLEY here&mdash; you would never forget&mdash;gentle, grace|ful, elegant, &s;oft, genteel, and eloquent. &mdash;Heigho!&mdash;Why, CHARLOTTE, why did I marry, before I had &s;een

<P>FANNY is much di&s;ordered, my dear LUCY; the fainting with which &s;he was &s;eized at the breakfa&s;t-rooms, has preyed on her ever &s;ince. Her &s;pirits are greatly agitated.

She is too indi&s;|po&s;ed to remove at pre&s;ent: for my part, I have not been able to &s;et my foot yet in the &s;treet: I love my &s;i&s;ter too tender|ly, to leave her with a &s;trange woman, in a &s;trange place, e&s;pecially with one, who is merely paid for her attention, and who, con&s;equently, can have none of tho&s;e charming thoughts that enter into the heart of a tender relation. Sometimes, my dear, the changing a po&s;ture, &s;ome|times the &s;hifting a pillow, or fixing a chair, does more by the <HI>method</HI> of do|ing it, than all the elaborate efforts of an avowed nur&s;e. A Mr. SEDLEY&mdash;who is &s;aid to be the beauty of the Bath, and was the per&s;on that handed FANNY down

&s;tairs, and was very obliging during her illne&s;s,&mdash;&s;ends every day, very re&s;pectfully, to know how the &s;ick lady improves in her health.

<P>The <HI>manner</HI> in which this gentleman makes the enquiry, is pretty: he does not pre&s;ume upon the privilege of a public place, and &s;end a blundering foot-boy with a me&s;&s;age, nor does he come, in|truding, <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but he u&s;ually writes a little billet, (every day varied, and containing a new turn,) in which his ex|pre&s;&s;ions di&s;cover at once accompli&s;hment and high-breeding; and, what puts it out of any body's power to mi&s;con&s;true it
<PB N="106" REF="119">
into de&s;ign, he always addre&s;&s;es his cards to MR. MORTIMER. As my brother was reading one of the&s;e this morning to his wife, &s;he de&s;ired to look at the hand, but had &s;carce held it to her eye, before &s;he dropt the paper, and, letting her arm fall languidly on the pillow, &s;aid, very &s;oftly, that &s;he could not manage it, and was weaker than &s;he imagined.</P>
<P>She is now in a gentle do&s;e, and I took the opportunity it gave, to inform my dear Lucy of our pre&s;ent melancholy &s;ituation. Sir HARRY, and my mother are expected hourly. If FANNY really dies, my mother will certainly go di&s;|tracted. Heaven ble&s;s you, and yours.</P>

<P>I HAVE appeared in public. I dined this day at the ordinary. <HI>Ordinary</HI> indeed! &s;uch a room full of emptine&s;s I never beheld: citizens apeing the men of mode, women of &s;allow countenances, and fops, who would be thought witty and elegant, when they are merely &s;aucy, and affected, and dull. Alas! THORN|TON, what a pity, what a mortification! I have not a &s;ingle competitor,&mdash;I mean not in point of gallantry, for that mili|tates again&s;t my &s;y&s;tem of plea&s;ure,&mdash; but there is no one of <HI>my</HI> &s;ex from whom I can gain any real honour in the compa|ri&s;on. However, as even blockheads are
<PB N="116" REF="129">
worth gaining, and their hearts worth mi&s;leading; as they have all foibles to flatter, and weakne&s;&s;es that may be for our intere&s;t to work upon: I began to &s;hew off, and brought the whole company over, as my admirers. I practi&s;ed all the charming conver&s;ation-rules of DORMER, with as much facility as if I had been the author of them; and, indeed, they are &s;o &s;uited to my own natural &s;entiments, that I only con&s;ider him as having <HI>writ|ten,</HI> what I long ago <HI>thought,</HI> and what I will henceforward invariably practi&s;e, till I am incapable of farther enjoyment.

The fool lookt as if he piqued him&s;elf upon his gaudine&s;s, he &s;troaked his ruffles, di&s;played
<PB N="117" REF="130">
the baubles of his watch, perkt up his head to gaze in the pier-gla&s;&s;es, pulled his watch in and out of his fob &s;everal times, eyed him&s;elf a&s;cance, and figitted up and down in his chair, with all the in&s;ignificant whiffling agility of the mon|key in the fable, who had &s;een the world.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to the &s;ide of this popinjay, &s;at an unweildy animal, who, to the man|ners of a bear, united the uncouthne&s;s of an elephant, without half its &s;agacity; and who, in feeding, &s;cattered his offals a|round, to the utter di&s;may of the cox|comb, who, fearful of complaining, and alarmed at the &s;ize of the antagoni&s;t, took &s;helter at a &s;mall table, or rather &s;ide|board, and fluttered him&s;elf clean, while the mon&s;ter enjoyed his embarra&s;&s;ment.

<P>I eat elegantly, drank di&s;creetly. I <HI>&s;miled</HI> at a thou&s;and <HI>dull</HI> &s;tories, and only told <HI>one</HI> my&s;elf, and that, incon|ceivably a-propos.

I dre&s;&s;ed my countenance in &s;oftne&s;s, and gave the <HI>dou&ccedil;eur</HI> to all my motions. I interrupted no man, con|tradicted cautiou&s;ly, palliated tenderly, decided a di&s;pute betwixt the fop and the glutton with a good-humoured plea|&s;antry, caught the habits of the company, &s;wore not at all, and adapted my con|ver&s;ation to every &s;peaker. The con&s;e|quence
<PB N="119" REF="132">
was, THORNTON, that I was im|mediately known to be <HI>&s;omebody,</HI> nay, I was the admiration of <HI>every body:</HI> my com|pany was cheri&s;hed, my ab&s;ence regretted, and, at my going out of the room, a buz of univer&s;al approbation followed me down &s;tairs. In a word, THORNTON, the fops were annihilated, the prattlers were &s;ilenced, and I went off in the com|pleate&s;t triumph of unconte&s;ted excel|lence.</P>

<P>RECEIVE TIMOTHY, the greet|ing of THOMAS.</P>
<P>I, and my ma&s;ter, arrived on the day we &s;et out at this execrable place, where I have as yet done little more than &s;tick a pin in SEDLEY'S hair, and peru&s;e a page of his CHESTERFIELD after dinner.</P>
<P>The&s;e books we are both exce&s;&s;ively fond of, and as he always leaves them in the chamber-window, I take them <HI>up</HI> when he lays them <HI>down</HI> to walk out; by which means we make pretty nearly
<PB N="121" REF="134">
the &s;ame progre&s;s. If any thing, I be|lieve I am half a volume before-hand with him, and, in the opinion of the judicious, am the finer gentleman of the two.</P>
<P>Not that my ma&s;ter, like your com|mon coxcombs, ever mentions his a|mours, or his &s;tudies to his &s;ervant, any more than I di&s;cover mine to him: we are both better bred; but I have heard too much of CHESTERFIELD at table, at tea, and every where el&s;e, not to have had, long ago, a reli&s;h for his writings; and I &s;cruple not to tell thee, TIMO|THY, that I have formed my&s;elf, what you know me to be, entirely on his Lord&s;hip's model.</P>
<P>He had, beyond compari&s;on, the pret|tie&s;t pen, at an epi&s;tle, in Europe, and is at once &s;o neat and plain, that it is
<PB N="122" REF="135">
impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;under&s;tand him. I once was as vulgar a dog in my choice of books as any in the kingdom;&mdash;I had no more ta&s;te, TIMOTHY, than a teacher of the table of multiplication. I thought the lu&s;cious love-&s;cenes of ROCHESTER delicious, and had a mighty hankering after the memoirs of CLELAND; but hea|ven defend me from &s;uch barefaced tra&s;h, The bawdry brutes!</P>

<P>I expect, by the Earl's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to do an infinite deal of mi&s;chief at this watering-place;&mdash;my eye (though no
<PB N="123" REF="136">

<P>SEDLEY is upon &s;ome project, but I &s;corn to be guilty of impertinent cu|rio&s;ity; and he is as much above mak|ing either a confident or a pimp of his &s;ervant, I &s;hould with more propriety have &s;aid his <HI>gentleman,</HI> as his gentle|man is of wearing a livery of wor&s;ted lace.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Doctor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THINGS are &s;o plea&s;ingly al|tered, that I have been over-ruled as to my de&s;ign of going away even at the end of the fortnight, and I have con|trived to procure another week's rece&s;s, in order to extend my HARRIET'S hap|pine&s;s, and enjoy my&s;elf the &s;pirited, yet moral and engaging conduct of Mr. SEDLEY, who, every day, becomes more agreeable, and who, I do truly believe, has been not a little in&s;trumental in
<PB N="147" REF="160">
bringing about my poor wife to a pro|per &s;en&s;e of her duty and right rea&s;on. If any-thing, &s;he is more cordial to me than before my departure from the cu|racy, and is at once lively and obliging.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, the &s;trange con|duct I tran&s;mitted you an account of in my late letters, was only a tran&s;ient gid|dine&s;s, not very infrequent, as I have ob|&s;erved, Doctor, to the fair &s;ex, about HARRIET'S age, which is very well called, in one of SHAKESPEARE'S trage|dies that I read formerly, the <Q>heyday of youthful blood.</Q> We grave folks, you know, my dear DIGGORY, ought to al|low for all this. Poor thing, I pity her, and am half angry with my&s;elf that I &s;hould have treated the overflowing, ef|ferve&s;cent emanations, as I may &s;tile them, of a juvenile mind, as a &s;erious delirium.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="161">But, thank God, it is not gone abroad to any per&s;on who is capable of circu|lating the whi&s;per of the day to the detriment of a fellow-creature. Mr. SED|LEY, who, I can ea&s;ily &s;ee, is to be tru&s;t|ed with every thing, and my old friend, and brother-collegian, Doctor DIGGORY, are the only per&s;ons informed of the matter, and &s;o all is well. But do not, I charge you, think too hardly of her for what hath been &s;aid. It was all a mi&s;|repre&s;entation, and you &s;hould admire your heavenly HARRIET, as you u&s;ed to call her, the <HI>more,</HI> for having been <HI>in|jured.</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you, I am at pre|&s;ent more &s;atisfied with <HI>her</HI> than I am with <HI>my&s;elf:</HI> and, indeed, &s;he has the advantage of me; for &s;he appears in the light of a per&s;on <HI>calumniated,</HI> and I am only one in a &s;tate of con&s;cious error, and <HI>probation.</HI></P>

me with &s;uch an ocean of love-&s;ayings, and, in &s;hort, talked &s;o different from my old &s;weetheart ROGER DOUSIT, who is all dull and downright, as I may &s;ay, that I <HI>declares</HI> to your Honour, he at la&s;t made me think it would be a &s;in to refu&s;e him; and &s;o&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;and &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;o&mdash;you did <HI>not</HI> refu&s;e, hey? Is that it?&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the poor girl drew out her hand|kerchief, and had &s;incerely a very great occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>She told me, in a tone, THORNTON, that touched me, that if, notwith&s;tanding what THOMAS &s;aid, &s;he had been wicked, &s;he was a ruined woman, that was all&mdash; that it might do very well for <HI>gentlefolks</HI> to play fal&s;e with one another, becau&s;e <HI>they</HI> had got <HI>wherewithal</HI> to wa&s;h all white

She added, that, for her own part, &s;he did not &s;o much mind it, as &s;he could turn her hand to any-thing, and would leave the town in a twinkle; but that &s;he had an old mother, that had been bedridden the&s;e eight months, who lived at FAIRFIELD, and who mu&s;t now want bread as well as her&s;elf. Nay, for that matter, &s;aid the girl, &s;he'll &s;oon be pro|vided for, if &s;he hears of my &s;lip, with|out troubling the pari&s;h; for I &s;hall &s;oon break her heart: I &s;hall &s;oon &s;end my

<P>She now dropt her tears, THORNTON, as fa&s;t, to u&s;e the language of SHAKE|SPEARE,
<Q><L>As the Arabian tree</L>

At this very moment THOMAS came in with a me&s;&s;age on which he had been di&s;patched.</P>
<P>What is it, THORNTON, what cur&s;ed trouble&s;ome thing is it, at once invi&s;ible,

<P>He &s;tammered, he &s;taggered, he turned white, and attempted to retreat.</P>
<P>I commanded him to &s;tay; and, taking my &s;word from the hook, gave him his choice, and one that might have puzzled a much wi&s;er man&mdash;either to die or marry. Fear operated even &s;o &s;trong, as to make him chu&s;e the latter.</P>

<P>THE &s;tory of thy bath-maid in|tere&s;ted me &s;trangely; and I have felt the more plea&s;ure in giving it a tear, becau&s;e I perceive it hath penetrated even the al|mo&s;t invulnerable PHILIP SEDLEY.</P>
<P>But how thou art able to &s;tand the &s;hock of &s;o many radient eyes, and yield|ed charms,&mdash;wrapt round and round as thou art in the ely&s;ium of voluntary and voluptuous embraces&mdash;a young fellow of &s;pirit too&mdash;is, to <HI>me,</HI> mo&s;t unaccount|ably my&s;terious.&mdash;In defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine DOR|MER&mdash;in defiance of all empirici&s;m&mdash;I
<PB N="177" REF="190">
&s;hould certainly break out, and even at the ri&s;que of overturning the whole well-woven web of gallantry, dwindle into a downright inamerato, and quite lo&s;e the &s;ubtle di&s;tinction betwixt &s;imulation and laudible in&s;incerity.</P>
<P>And &s;o thou had&s;t the &s;upreme of tran&s;|port, in uniting thy faithle&s;s footman to the beautiful bath-maid!</P>
<P>I'll tell thee what, SEDLEY,&mdash;thou art &mdash;(if thou wilt allow me for once the coinage of a new word)&mdash;thou art but half CHESTERFIELDED.&mdash;The impre&s;&s;ion made upon thee by the pale face of the con&s;cious THOMAS&mdash;the plea&s;ure thou had&s;t at wiping away the drops of pe|nitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of &s;implicity&mdash;and thy wi&s;hing to &s;oliloqui&s;e, and be excu&s;ed, even from the arms of the tempting and <HI>married</HI> HAR|RIET
<PB N="178" REF="191">
&mdash;are all &s;ymptoms totally <HI>un&s;tanho|pean</HI> (there's another word for thee).</P>
<P>Take care, SEDLEY: thou art upon the eve of a relap&s;e&mdash;a relap&s;e in favour, not of DORMER, but of down-right DOU|SIT'S &s;ingle-dealing.</P>
<P>And yet, my friend, &s;hall I once again confe&s;s to you my infirmity&mdash;my une&s;ta|bli&s;hment in the maxims of thy Precep|tor?&mdash;I cannot blame thy weakne&s;&s;es, nor can I&mdash;however de&s;tructive they may be to <HI>thy</HI> &s;y&s;tem&mdash;avoid wi&s;hing thou may&s;t continue thy pre&s;ent tendencies, e&s;pecially as, by thy own hone&s;t confe&s;|&s;ion, thou ha&s;t found more gratification in them, than in &s;upporting the toil&s;ome ta&s;k of eternal di&s;ingenuity.</P>
<P>Nor ought I, indeed, to <HI>call</HI> this a weakne&s;s in me. If to be happy is the
<PB N="179" REF="192">
ultimatum of all earthly pur&s;uits&mdash;if it is equally the effort of every different order of men, it a&s;&s;uredly follows, that <HI>that</HI> conduct is the mo&s;t rational by which the greate&s;t &s;hare of felicity is procured. The clo&s;e&s;t application of human wit and wi&s;dom can do no more than point out to thee the mo&s;t &s;olid degree of joy, and it matters not whether that joy is ob|tained by the practice of <HI>one</HI> &s;y&s;tem or <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t action thou ha&s;t recorded (I allude to the promi&s;ed nuptials of thy bath-maid) was evidently agreeable to the &s;entiments of SENECA, SOCRATES, and all the wi&s;e and good men both of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t; and &s;ince the precepts of STANHOPE have been unable to give thee a &s;uperior, or even an <HI>equal</HI> felicity, how proper and con&s;i&s;tent with right rea|&s;on is it in me, to advi&s;e thee to walk
<PB N="180" REF="193">
in that path wherein thou ha&s;t found the mo&s;t plea&s;ure? Laugh not&mdash;ridicule not, I be&s;eech thee: thou art not, I hope, &s;o much a tool to the ta&s;te of the times &mdash;&s;o much a dupe to prejudiced opi|nions&mdash;as to di&s;like even the balance of bli&s;s which is now in thy favour, merely becau&s;e the &s;cale hath been turned by a worthy action&mdash;that would be in&s;anity.</P>
<P>To love duplicity, and certain &s;ophi&s;|tical di&s;tinctions, merely for the &s;ake of double-dealing, and when plain, clear, clean, uncrooked hone&s;ty will an&s;wer thy purpo&s;e much <HI>better,</HI> is at once ridicu|lous and diabolical.</P>
<P>On the whole, therefore, I advi&s;e thee, in the deliberation of my heart, to &s;ub|&s;titute the afore&s;aid SENECA, or &s;ome other &s;y&s;tematical morali&s;t, in&s;tead of STANHOPE; and to lay <HI>him</HI> quickly
<PB N="181" REF="194">
a&s;ide in a corner of thy trunk, as un|qualified to confer the comfort he pro|fe&s;&s;es to admini&s;ter.</P>
<P>And, indeed, SEDLEY, to open my whole &s;oul to thee, I mu&s;t own thee, that I very much &s;u&s;pect his Lord&s;hip's &s;entiments. Even in my occa&s;ional deal|ings here in Town, &s;ince thy departure, I have not been able to make them bear the te&s;t quite to my &s;atisfaction: &s;uch, e&s;pecially, as relate to the &s;uduction of the tender &s;ex. I made a &s;light experi|ment, no longer ago than la&s;t night, of his mo&s;t favourite maxim, namely, to ta&s;te the joys of <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> mingled in embraces; and yet, though I do not think I con|ducted my&s;elf unadroitly, it did not al|together an&s;wer the &s;atisfaction he pre|dicted to re&s;ult from it</P>
<P>Thou art not a &s;tranger to the elegan|cies
<PB N="182" REF="195">
of SOPHIA VERNON, the new-mar|ried wife of the man who&s;e promotion from en&s;ign to lieutenant it was our joint endeavour, &s;ome time ago, to effect: his gratitude is &s;till&mdash;<Q>tremblingly alive all o'er;</Q> and, by a natural con&s;equence, he is without the lea&s;t tincture of &s;u&s;pi|cion, and e&s;teems every in&s;tance of parti|cular enquiry after his wife, or friend, as a mark of genero&s;ity in his bene|factor.</P>
<P>This leaves the way to an intimacy with his SOPHIA fair and unob&s;tructed; and &s;he has already caught &s;o much of the Lieutenant's enthu&s;ia&s;m, that &s;he pays me the tribute of a ro&s;y-red blu&s;h of acknowledgment as often as I approach her. They have lately purcha&s;ed a pretty cottage, amid&s;t the vernal beauties of SURRY: it is &s;urrounded by gardens, not <HI>citti&s;h,</HI> but genteel: there are no nudi|ties,
<PB N="183" REF="196">
no mon&s;trous urns, no fanta&s;tical fountains, no chubby cherubims, no tip|toed Mercury's, &s;mirking Venu&s;&s;es, nor &s;pruce holly-hedges: 'tis all <Q>true Na|ture to advantage dre&s;&s;ed;</Q> the verdure is voluptuous, the flower-beds well weed|ed, the &s;hrubbery gratefully &s;haded, and the alcove &s;miles upon the Thames.</P>
<P>Within this alcove I ye&s;terday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of SOPHIA, who&s;e hu&s;band had invited me pre&s;&s;ingly, to make the &s;olitude of his lady more &s;ocial by my company, as he was him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of tak|ing a journey into SUSSEX.</P>
<P>As you love brooks and books, hills and rills, my dear Mr. THORNTON, &s;aid he, &s;milingly, you and SOPHY will be able to pa&s;s away your time to your mutual &s;atisfaction, till the return of your friend.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="197">Poor, un&s;u&s;picious pair!</P>
<P>They united their entreaties, and pre|vailed: Lieutenant VERNON &s;et out, and left to thy friend <HI>(in tru&s;t)</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful property upon the banks of the THAMES. In a word, he began his journey in the fragrant coolne&s;s of ye&s;ter|day's evening, and I was left at full li|berty to abu&s;e the confidence he placed in my integrity, and, in return for his ho&s;pitality, do my utmo&s;t to de&s;troy the cha&s;tity of <HI>her,</HI> whom he doats upon with the &s;incere&s;t tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The tear which &s;he dropt upon his hand as &s;he ki&s;&s;ed it, at parting, drew from him <HI>another,</HI> accompanied by &s;uch a look, as defies either tongue, pen, or pencil, and went at the time &s;o clo&s;e to my heart, that I could not but imagine the pa&s;&s;ion betwixt two, was more ex|qui&s;ite
<PB N="185" REF="198">
than if it were divided betwixt two-and-twenty. One man and one wo|man, thought I, may certainly be hap|pier than a Sultan; and I had rather po&s;|&s;e&s;s the real, <HI>undi&s;&s;imulated</HI> love of a SO|PHIA VERNON, than command the keys of the &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>SOPHIA remained pen&s;ive, and &s;ighed after the travelling Lieutenant.</P>
<P>I examined the little library for a book to entertain her. CHESTERFIELD was there, but I did not think it a proper book to read, as I would wi&s;h to keep the maxims as far out of the &s;ight of a female as po&s;&s;ible: for when a woman is <HI>told the &s;ecret</HI> of her &s;eduction, &s;he will naturally be upon her guard again&s;t the &s;educer; and, really, STANHOPE un|folds the art with &s;uch per&s;picuity, that &s;he who runs may read; nay; even thy
<PB N="186" REF="199">
footman comprehends the whole &s;y&s;tem, and hath, according to thy account, ru|ined his woman with a very <HI>tolerable ad|dre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>By the by, SEDLEY, I have to accu&s;e thee of two weak pieces of conduct. The fir&s;t is, thy ra&s;hne&s;s in tru&s;ting the epi&s;tles of thy Preceptor to the flighty HARRIET, who might have heedle&s;sly &s;hewn them to HORACE, by which means (as thou art a very &s;triking commentary upon the chapters of CHESTERFIELD) he would have had a clue to the original &s;ources of thy pre&s;ent conduct; and a detection of this kind would have been totally in|&s;upportable. Thy other fault is, thy carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and, I might &s;ay, want of po|licy, in expo&s;ing the volumes which thou &s;o pretende&s;t to venerate, to the plebeian eyes of thy <HI>valet.</HI> Lock them up, I pray thee, for the time to come; and if
<PB N="187" REF="200">
thou art re&s;olved to proceed in reducing them to practice, do it <HI>privately.</HI></P>
<P>In regard to SOPHIA, my endeavours to divert her thoughts <HI>from</HI> the beloved &s;ubject of their contemplation, were in vain: the Lieutenant mingled in every idea, and &s;he had pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ighs, &s;enti|ments, and &s;en&s;ations, only for Mr. VER|NON. I recited to her an elegy from HAMMOND, and &s;he wept, in the &s;ince|rity of her heart, over images &s;o amia|ble, and &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e now &s;ug|ge&s;ted by her <HI>own</HI> &s;ituation. I wi&s;hed to divert her, by reading to her the od|dities of corporal <HI>Trim,</HI> and uncle <HI>Toby:</HI> but &s;he was in no di&s;po&s;ition to be de|lighted with the whim&s;ical &s;trokes of a fine, but irregular wit. I even adverted to the irre&s;i&s;tible &s;allies of HARRY FIELDING, and di&s;played to her the ma&s;ter-piece of narrative, in the laugh|able
<PB N="188" REF="201">
&s;cene of Par&s;on ADAMS pur&s;ued by the hounds and hunters. She was proof even again&s;t this, and afforded it only a faint &s;mile. She then tried what a walk in the garden would do: &s;he critici&s;ed the colours of the tulips, and de&s;canted with moral delicacy on the plea&s;ing pro|gre&s;s of vegetable Nature; but, alas! even here a &s;igh would break in upon her re|mark, and very evidently convince me, that Pope was not &s;o romantic in the pa&s;toral &s;entiment, which ob&s;erves, <Q>Ab|&s;ence is &s;urely death to tho&s;e who love.</Q> In &s;hort, SEDLEY, whatever might be the temptation before me, and however a&s;&s;iduous I was to gratify it, it was not now the moment to begin the attack; and every-thing I &s;aid, only &s;erved to &s;hew me more plainly, that, if I would wi&s;h to plea&s;e her, it mu&s;t be by talking warmly of a man, whom it was my intere&s;t to wean from her affec|tions.
<PB N="189" REF="202">
Perceiving this, I gave way to &s;ympathy, and mo&s;t cordially united <HI>my</HI> tears to <HI>hers,</HI> and joined in the mo&s;t ani|mated encomiums on her happy Lieute|nant. The&s;e tears, however, SEDLEY, and tho&s;e prai&s;es, gave me a &s;oothing &s;oftne&s;s not to be de&s;cribed, and made me feel a thou&s;and times more agreeable than while I repre&s;&s;ed them, in the hope of turning my thoughts to the hu&s;band's di&s;honour, and the wife's de&s;truction. Is not this, SEDLEY, a parallel ca&s;e to that of thine? If thou wert more happy at doing a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> action to thy bath-maid, than at an <HI>unju&s;t</HI> one, by <HI>undoing</HI> the lively HARRIET; I am more happy at having conquered an inclination, which would have tormented my own fancy, tortured a "generous, tru&s;ting friend," and agonized the bo&s;om of a woman, who&s;e reputation is at pre&s;ent un&s;u&s;pected, and unpolluted.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="203">Hence then, my dear SEDLEY, it ap|pears, that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a &s;imilar &s;en&s;ation&mdash;a &s;en&s;ation created by the &s;ocial virtues, and derived purely from the felicity of others. Upon this &s;ubject I have but one point to ob|&s;erve: it is, to <HI>continue</HI> the triumph. Let us even cheri&s;h a tran&s;port, which is &s;u|perior to any that di&s;&s;imulation can give: let us throw away the perplexing ma&s;k of the ca&s;ui&s;tical CHESTERFIELD: let us walk in the <HI>right</HI> way, and &s;ince it hath already <HI>rewarded</HI> us &s;o well, let us prefer truth to fal&s;ehood, and hone&s;ty to hypo|cri&s;y: for, believe me, my dear, dear SEDLEY, under whatever name we may di&s;tingui&s;h vice and virtue, they remain eternally the &s;ame, and neither &s;ophi&s;try, nor &s;ubtlety, nor fa&s;hion, nor the &s;ancti|fied follies of the mode, can po&s;&s;ibly pal|liate the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of the one, or de|tract from the native excellence of the other. PENMEN may puzzle, PHILOSO|PHERS
<PB N="191" REF="204">
may refine, POETS may colour, and vi&s;ionaries may &s;ugge&s;t as they plea&s;e, but, while the traces of Nature remain, virtue will be fair, and vice deformed; and, in my opinion, that man's maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible, who, in the <HI>&s;ame volume,</HI> nay, &s;ometimes in the <HI>&s;ame epi&s;tle,</HI> inculcates a delicate regard to <HI>moral</HI> character, and an attack upon tho&s;e human <HI>weakne&s;&s;es,</HI> from the humouring of which (a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a pro|per mixture of well-applied flattery) we are to prey upon each other, to prepare our&s;elves for deceit, and, if the &s;y&s;tem were general, introduce, by the&s;e means, even while we &s;anctify them, the mo&s;t dangerous delu&s;ions. For my part, SED|LEY, I tell thee again, and again, that I find a flaw in thy STANHOPE, and &s;hall read him, for the future, with the eye of a &s;evere critic, and not an idolater&mdash;not a PHILIP SEDLEY.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LII. SEDLEY</HI> to <HI>THORNTON.</HI> (Prior to his Receipt of the la&s;t Letter.)</HEAD>
<P>THE ceremony has been per|formed. I in&s;i&s;ted on its being done in the face of the congregation, I gave THOMAS a pur&s;e for his wedding-dinner, and &s;o the poor wench is again made an hone&s;t woman.</P>
<P>Never heard I panegyrics more warm or better circulated than tho&s;e reverberated from lip to lip upon this occa&s;ion; and I could almo&s;t ble&s;s the fellow for a de|bauchery, that hath added &s;uch lu&s;tre to my character. I am the very ballad of
<PB N="193" REF="206">
the bath; and the negligence which I &s;eem to pay to the prai&s;es, only &s;erves to increa&s;e, and make me appear more de&s;erv|ing of them. But what a &s;impleton I was, in yielding to the baby &s;en&s;ation which &s;eized me unawares in my la&s;t. To do good is, indeed, <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> and I will on that principle continue to do it as occa&s;ion invites; but Is there not an higher mo|tive, thou wilt &s;ay, than this?&mdash;Is there not <HI>religion?</HI> P&s;haw!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, pious THORNTON, there is a higher motive. It flatters the &s;en&s;es, it gratifies vanity, it procures <HI>eclat,</HI> it promotes con|que&s;t, it extends our triumph over a &s;ex that was born for our amu&s;ement.&mdash;The trifling action ju&s;t recorded, backed by a few more that I have not patience to re|cite, hath made me &s;o popular among&s;t all ranks of people in this village, from my Lady in her bathing-&s;hift, to her at|tendants

<P>I have e&s;tabli&s;hed my reputation, THORN|TON, upon the &s;olid ba&s;is of virtuous ac|tions; I have decorated the &s;uper&s;tructure, with the graces of conduct; and now, no man will dare to imagine this goodly edi|fice is but a <HI>whitened</HI> &s;epulchre. Po&s;|&s;ibly thou may&s;t imagine, that I have earned my plea&s;ures by difficult adop|tion of the STANHOPEAN &s;y&s;tem. No, THORNTON, I have a ta&s;te for them. I do not <Q>inflict exce&s;&s;es upon my&s;elf, becau&s;e I think them genteel,</Q> but I find the&s;e pur&s;uits <Q>guard me again&s;t frivolou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> and prevent me <Q>from throwing away upon trifles, that time, which only important things de&s;erve.</Q> In a word, I tell thee once more, I view the Lord of my Idolatry only as a man
<PB N="195" REF="208">
more &s;killed than my&s;elf, in the arts of being <HI>truly</HI> happy: and in this light he de&s;erves my everla&s;ting gratitude; for he hath taught me <Q>to make every place I go to, the &s;cene of quick and lively tran&s;ports; to let every company I frequent, gratify my <HI>pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> to know the true value of time; and to &s;natch, &s;eize, and <HI>enjoy</HI> every moment of it.</Q></P>
<P>Of this enough: the remainder of my letter &s;hall be dedicated to the delicious purpo&s;e of recording &s;everal events, which have fallen out, by the joint effort of de&s;tiny and contrivance, &s;ince my la&s;t.</P>

Her hu&s;band bowed to me, as to the polite &s;tranger, who had intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o much in the welfare of his beloved: the &s;i&s;ter inclined her head, and curte&s;y'd <HI>more</HI> than civilly&mdash;it was the bend, rather of attention, than ceremony.</P>
<P>At this moment, many a lank-haired &s;wain, yet humid with the bath, and a clu&s;ter of women, &s;till glowing from the immer&s;ion, appeared in view. They were in&s;tantly attracted by the meteor, gazed, envied, and pa&s;&s;ed on. Well, indeed, <HI>might</HI> they gaze&mdash;well might they envy, THORNTON: the ro&s;e again emulates the lilly, in her cheek; the blue is like the blue of the elements; her arm, is ani|mated alaba&s;ter; and the hand, to which it belongs, is &s;haped to <HI>in&s;pire</HI> by its ap|pearance, and <HI>enfever</HI> by its touch.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="210">After this, as &s;he was preparing to re|turn, a &s;ervant came ha&s;tily to inform Mr. MORTIMER, that Sir HENRY DEL|MORE was arrived.

The good Baronet was impatient, and (eager to behold his children) came forward in his boots to meet them.</P>
<P>Oh, THORNTON, what a figure!&mdash;how noble! how venerable! how fa&s;hionable! &mdash;But, alas! all &s;urprizes, even tho&s;e of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind, are too much for the feeble &s;ituation of FANNY. Her fa|ther &s;oon &s;aw her confu&s;ion, &s;oftened it by a paternal ki&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in con|ducing her home to her lodgings.

As my wife, how|ever, &s;eems re&s;olved, I have thought of an expedient to &s;upply my ab&s;ence for a few days longer. HARRIET hath a friend in our neighbourhood&mdash;a Mrs. LA MOTTE&mdash;who is a very di&s;creet, &s;en&s;ible,

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LVII.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>DELIA DELMORE,</HI> to Lady <HI>LUCY SAXBY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT an additional degree of happine&s;s do I feel, &s;ince I la&s;t wrote to my beloved Lady LUCY? My father is arrived, my &s;i&s;ter is recovering, and we are become acquainted with a man who&s;e company is at once plea&s;ing, in&s;tructive, and various. The very gentleman, my dear LUCY, who hath &s;o frequently &s;ent his polite cards of enquiry concern|ing FANNY, proves to be a man of birth, rank, and character, and well-known both to <HI>Sir</HI> HENRY, and <HI>Mr.</HI> MORTIMER, when they were la&s;t &s;ea&s;on at the bath of SCARBOROUGH. He is
<PB N="209" REF="222">
the mo&s;t well-bred and complai&s;ant cha|racter in the world, and has, at the fir&s;t interview, all the ea&s;e, firmne&s;s, and un|embarra&s;&s;ed air of an old acquaintance. The a&s;&s;ured, yet mode&s;t manner with which he pre&s;ents him&s;elf to a company, &s;hews plainly that he has been long accu&s;tomed to fa&s;hionable &s;ocieties, and would charm you. If FANNY continues to recover, we &s;hall be once more a joyful family&mdash;my mother is al&s;o down with us.</P>
<P>We have taken part of a very elegant hou&s;e, only a &s;hort ride from the com|pany, about three miles di&s;tant from BUX|TON, and it &s;tands upon a &s;pot infinitely le&s;s bleak and barren than the uncom|fortable-looking mountains that &s;urround the bath. I received the welcome epi&s;tle, dear LUCY, in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of ab&s;ence, in a cor|re&s;pondence of wi&s;dom, wit, &s;entiment,
<PB N="210" REF="223">
and affection: but does not my fair friend forget that the requi&s;ites to form and to continue &s;uch an intercour&s;e, are not at the command of every &s;cribbler, though the partiality of Nature, and the poli&s;h of high-breeding, may confer them on her|&s;elf? However, &s;ince you are &s;o earne&s;t with me, I will pour out my &s;oul imper|fectly upon paper, and though I may be wanting in point of elegance, or accuracy, the deficiencies will be compen&s;ated by a frankne&s;s of mind, and an undi&s;gui&s;e of &s;entiment, that will pay a better compli|ment to my LUCY'S candour, than all that could po&s;&s;ibly be be&s;towed by the flowers of rhetoric, or colourings of the imagination.</P>
<P>I the more readily yield to your urgen|cies, my LUCY, as my pen, at this pe|riod, can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtuous and endearing.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="224">It is &s;aid, indeed, that mankind have al|ways &s;ome fanta&s;tical and vi&s;ionary &s;cheme in view. I declare to you, Lady SAXBY, that the perfect re&s;toration of FANNY'S health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our dome&s;tic joy. Judge your&s;elf! for the vi&s;ible alteration of Mrs. MORTIMER for the better, hath put me into &s;uch &s;pirits, that I cannot re|&s;train my gratitude to the dear per&s;onages by which tho&s;e &s;pirits are in&s;pired. Take then, my beloved LUCY, the &s;ketch of a family-picture, drawn (and yet not par|tially) by the pencil of a relation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and principal figure in this group is, a father, who&s;e mind is the repo&s;itory of every virtue&mdash;a repo&s;itory in which he has been, from hour to hour, in the career of almo&s;t three&s;core years, laying up &s;omething valuable, till he hath at length &s;tored it with every excellence;
<PB N="212" REF="225">
with all, LUCY, that can give worth to the hu&s;band, &s;oftne&s;s to the parent, &s;oli|dity to the friend, benevolence to the neighbour, and humanity to the man: to which is added, a univer&s;al attention to the wants, and complaints, the fortunes, and morals of that prodigious body of men to which he is related only by &s;ame|ne&s;s of &s;pecies, and the con&s;cious ties of the chri&s;tian and fellow-creature.</P>
<P>The &s;econd leading object in the piece is a mother, the model of her hu&s;band; and differing only, by adapting the man|ly virtues to a delicacy more con&s;i&s;tent with the refinement and gentlene&s;s of the female character, and nature.</P>
<P>The third figure, to which I would di|rect your ob&s;ervation, is, the &s;till lovely FANNY MORTIMER,&mdash;a woman whom even the depredations of four lingering
<PB N="213" REF="226">
months, pa&s;&s;ed in the languors of &s;ick|ne&s;s, have not rendered unattracting. To a &s;pirit at once wi&s;e and worthy, &s;he &s;u|peradds the fine&s;t politene&s;s, gentlene&s;s uncommon, and meekne&s;s peculiar to her: and to the&s;e, again, are joined a ta&s;te ele|gant and &s;imple&mdash;an under&s;tanding en|larged and cultivated,&mdash;and a face, in de|fiance of di&s;temper, in which Heaven &s;eems to have painted an attribute in every fea|ture: her eye &s;parkles benignity, her lips are the temples of truth, her cheeks are the emblems of mode&s;ty veiled in ro&s;es, and her hands were formed by the Graces to the be&s;t of purpo&s;es&mdash;to charm, by their liberality, the wretched into peace, and to be (con&s;i&s;tently with their colour) the pure and beautiful &s;tewards of a heart tender as a turtle's, yet &s;olid as a &s;age's.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band of this enchanting crea|ture, is the brother of Lady SAXBY, the
<PB N="214" REF="227">
very counter-part of his &s;i&s;ter, and the very youth whom Sir HENRY DELMORE adopted as the child of his affection, un|dertook for &s;everal years the direction of his education, &s;upplied the lo&s;s of a fa|ther, trained him up for his own, and at la&s;t gave him, all-accompli&s;hed, to the only woman that could de&s;erve him&mdash;his <HI>daughter.</HI> His character is recorded in mo&s;t of the European courts; and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for <HI>me</HI> to &s;ay, that he has been every where di&s;tingui&s;hed, for bravery without ra&s;hne&s;s, honour without ance&s;tral pride, elegance without vanity, affection with|out intere&s;tedne&s;s, and genero&s;ity without o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>Such, LUCY, are the outlines of a pic|ture now under the eye of your friend. Your ab&s;ence, however, and FANNY'S un|certain &s;tate of health, are the two dark
<PB N="215" REF="228">
clouds that overca&s;t my otherwi&s;e radiant horizon.</P>
<P>In &s;ome mea&s;ure, however, to atone for the&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible drawbacks, I can now promi&s;e an often-repeated intercour&s;e, in which, through the kind medium of the po&s;t, our plea&s;ures, with tho&s;e of our fa|milies, &s;hall be reciprocated&mdash;But&mdash;in the the name of extravagance, where am I rambling&mdash;and what a metaphorical rhap|&s;ody am I going to &s;end?

<PB N="217" REF="230">
&s;ince the departure of HORACE.

<Q>At ev'ry word a reputation dies.</Q>
And I would not be thought a libertine, either in thought, word, or deed, for the univer&s;e. 'Tis expre&s;&s;ly, and flagrantly,
<PB N="218" REF="231">
again&s;t my &s;y&s;tem, which, thou knowe&s;t, places the very perfection of human na|ture, and the height of human abilities, in "being upon our <HI>own</HI> guard, and yet, by a <HI>&s;eeming</HI> natural openne&s;s, to put peo|ple <HI>off theirs."</HI></P>
<P>Now, in ca&s;es of amour, it is, in con|formity to this principle, ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, that a hu&s;band &s;hould be upon the premi&s;es, though not upon the &s;pot; otherwi&s;e there is no po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding my&s;tery; and my&s;tery occa&s;ions &s;u&s;picion, and &s;u&s;picion opens a door to detection, and detection ruins me for ever. The or|dinary rake, thou knowe&s;t, piques him&s;elf upon this, nay, circulates it at the expence of his truth:
<Q><L>He talks of tran&s;ports that he never knew,</L>
<L>And fancies raptures that he never felt.</L></Q>
<PB N="219" REF="232">
But the pupils of CHESTERFIELD are not &s;uch "rude, vain-glorious boa&s;ters." They are to pre&s;erve their moral &s;anctity, even in the mid&s;t of (what gown&s;men call) vio|lation, not only of good report, but, like the purity of Cae&s;ar's wife, un&s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Oh! may this ingenuity and well-acted di&s;&s;imulation ever keep me from being blown upon; and, to this end, may I ne|ver withdraw the dear veil that keeps me <HI>apparently</HI> pure, one moment from my heart! May I ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the ingenuous exterior, with the re&s;erved interior; may I never reject, as trouble&s;ome, or u&s;ele&s;s, the ma&s;tery of my temper; and, above all other things, may I always po&s;&s;e&s;s my|&s;elf enough to hear, and &s;ee, every thing, without any vi&s;ible change of countenance!

<P>And indeed, THORNTON, I perceive, the adroite&s;t practice of the&s;e &s;everal points, &s;ugge&s;ted by the matchle&s;s DORMER, will be &s;hortly nece&s;&s;ary, for never did I enter &s;o &s;agacious, or &s;o uniformly amiable a family as that of the DELMORES.</P>
<P>The principal of it (Sir HENRY) is &s;o acute, &s;o adorned, &s;o read, &s;o experienced, that <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t, I perceive, be deceived with a delicacy even beyond the deceptions of Belial: and I wonder I did not lay my|&s;elf open to di&s;covery when at SCARBO|ROUGH, at a time that I was a novice in

the ways of STANHOPE, and could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to <HI>copy him, liberally.</HI> But, my good genius pre&s;erved me, and I engaged the hand of the father, and &s;truck hard upon the tender heart of his daughter.</P>
<P>Then there's a formidable hu&s;band in my way&mdash;no HORACE HOMESPUN&mdash;but a man of travel, experience, ta&s;te&mdash;A &s;e|cond &s;i&s;ter, too&mdash;the lively DELIA&mdash;a wit, a corre&s;ponder, a perfect pen-woman; and, to clo&s;e the li&s;t, a venerable matron&mdash; wi&s;e&mdash;virtuous&mdash;penetrating&mdash;the lady pre|&s;ident of this bewitching a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>What of that? If they are not ver&s;ed (as I <HI>believe</HI> they are not) in my maxims, I may be a match for all of them: pa&s;s like a meteor through this difficult hemi|&s;phere&mdash;kindle as I go&mdash;and dread no ra|diant competitor.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="235">As to HARRIET&mdash;the affair is over: nothing is left even for the exerci&s;e of my talents: the precept by which I obtained her, has been &s;ucce&s;sful in practice: all that remains, is ITERATION.

To provide, therefore, again&s;t the&s;e mo|ments of ardour, I &s;hall, if LA MOTTE comes down, retain the enamoured HAR|RIET in my train, as the agreeable re|&s;ource from the agitations in which it is likely I &s;hall be thrown by the charms, delays, or impediments, of the DELMORES. Po&s;&s;ibly, too, &s;omething may fall out to reduce LA MOTTE, which, be her per&s;o|nal endowments what they may, is de|&s;irable; becau&s;e &s;he is prepared to &s;u&s;pect my principles, and therefore will engage my more &s;erious attention, till &s;he &s;hall have little rea&s;on to ridicule or laugh at her friend.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, if this LA MOTTE does <HI>not</HI> move at the injunction of HORACE, nor at the pretended peni|tence of the letter-loving HARRIET, and, by the&s;e means, HARRIET &s;hould be left
<PB N="225" REF="238">
to her&s;elf, &s;he mu&s;t ab&s;olutely return to the bo&s;om of the poor pedant, and I will a&s;&s;uredly &s;acrifice the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per|&s;on to the unblemi&s;hed &s;ecurity of <HI>my</HI> cha|racter, which, I am aware, mu&s;t inevi|tably &s;uffer by being avowedly the Cici&s;beo of a wife little di&s;tingui&s;hed among&s;t the bathers and water-bibbers of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>If, indeed, &s;he had been ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;allow dam&s;el for a &s;i&s;ter, or a prudent gentlewoman for her aunt, it might have been another matter: but I again repeat it to you, that, in a place like this, in this &s;neaking, inqui&s;itive country of Bri|tain, it is, to all intents and purpo&s;es, re|qui&s;ite, for the &s;ecurity of my &s;y&s;tem, that there &s;hould be &s;ome third per&s;on in a family, by way of &s;creen; and rather than have our mi&s;tre&s;&s;es alone, that is, unprotected by &s;ome o&s;ten&s;ible he, or &s;he,
<PB N="226" REF="239">
that is an&s;werable for them in the pari&s;h where they vi&s;it, or where they re&s;ide, it is better for <HI>our</HI> plan of action, that we are &s;heltered under the withered wing of a maiden cou&s;in of a century's &s;tanding, or even of the great-grandmother her&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, THORNTON, for a word or two on thy own affairs. If thou ha&s;t not, by this time, &s;urmounted the ticklings of thy con&s;cience, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tender tenement, which thy friend the Lieutenant left to thee, thou de&s;erve&s;t to be for ever di&s;carded.</P>
<P>What! Ha&s;t thou an angel in "earth's mould?" Is &s;he in a wilderne&s;s of &s;weets? Art thou invited by a bed of ro&s;es? Art thou neither in fear of being bla&s;ted by detection, nor of incurring the prattle of a &s;ingle go&s;&s;ip of either &s;ex, (&s;eeing that
<PB N="227" REF="240">
thou art in a retirement perfectly &s;haded by a &s;hrubbery of perfumes, and apart from a &s;econd hou&s;e), and Is the good man of the hou&s;e gone a long journey into a far country?&mdash;Is all this in the way of propitiating thy advances, ma&s;ked, as I pre&s;ume they would be, in the fine veil of mode&s;ty, manner, and firmne&s;s, <HI>each</HI> (like co-partners, who&s;e intere&s;t it is to promote common-right in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s) a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing the <HI>other?</HI> and Do&s;t thou, after all, boggle at a &s;hadow&mdash;a maukin&mdash;at con|&s;cience?</P>
<P>Admitting even all thy wi&s;hes crowned with &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;where's the mi&s;chief? Thou do&s;t not de&s;poil her: the Lieutenant is ig|norant of what is granted, as of what was never attempted. The STANHOPE &s;cheme of fruition &s;uffers us not to do any <HI>real</HI> injury to individuals <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> or to the com|munity
<PB N="228" REF="241">
collectively; we are neither to be|tray the wife, nor to call the hu&s;band the cuckold we have had the honour to make him, nor to breathe an accent that may lead to the remote&s;t &s;u&s;picion. In &s;ome ca&s;es, THORNTON, this &s;y&s;tem is of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice (under the STANHOPEAN re&s;trictions, I mean) both to our King, and country.</P>
<P>How many puny &s;triplings are there who cannot do the common rights of nuptial ju&s;tice to the unhappy creatures that either intere&s;t, or folly, has chained them to for life? In that in&s;tance, it is ours to be&s;tow as a <HI>favour,</HI> what the hu&s;bands cannot di&s;charge as a <HI>duty.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, how many mi&s;erable pairs are there, &s;ighing for an heir to an unweildy e&s;tate, which mu&s;t, in default of
<PB N="229" REF="242">
i&s;&s;ue, devolve to the next fool or driveller in de&s;cent? There again <HI>we</HI> are patriots of the fir&s;t order: Do we not provide a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and create a being to inherit all the luxuries of life?</P>
<P>Nay, even &s;uppo&s;ing the hu&s;band en|abled to provide for him&s;elf: while our &s;y&s;tem dictates &s;o inviolable a <HI>&s;ecrecy,</HI> while the joys of it are not invaded by <HI>di&s;temper</HI> (and they can never be granted without the prior con&s;ent of the wife&mdash; and &s;uch con&s;ent implies that &s;uch variety is nece&s;&s;ary to her happine&s;s)&mdash;no injury can, in effect, be incurred. His <HI>own</HI> off|&s;pring we cannot de&s;troy; and <HI>ours</HI> will be con&s;idered as legitimate, and not be expo&s;ed, like the by-blows of the rake, to the &s;corn, de&s;ertion, and ill-fortunes of ba&s;tardy. So that, view the &s;y&s;tem of CHESTERFIELD on which &s;ide &s;oever you
<PB N="230" REF="243">
will, it is a &s;y&s;tem of policy, prudence, plea&s;ure, good-fellow&s;hip, and right rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Great length of paper, and much time, have I &s;tolen from more agreeable pur|&s;uits, to illu&s;trate this to thee: and if it move thee not, thou art altogether impe|netrable, and not de&s;erving &s;o &s;ublime a friend as the <HI>immaculate</HI></P>
