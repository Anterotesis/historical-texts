<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A COGITATION.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Margaret Monckton received Cecilia with the mo&s;t gloomy cold|ne&s;s: &s;he apologi&s;ed for the liberty &s;he had taken in making u&s;e of her lady|&s;hip's hou&s;e, but, meeting no return of civility, &s;he withdrew to the room which had been prepared for her, and re&s;olved as much as po&s;&s;ible to keep out of her &s;ight.</P>
<P>It now became nece&s;&s;ary without further delay to &s;ettle her plan of life, and fix her place of re&s;idence. The forbidding looks of Lady Margaret made her ha&s;ten her re&s;olves, which otherwi&s;e would for a while
<PB N="4" REF="3">
have given way to grief for her recent mis|fortune.</P>
<P>She &s;ent for the &s;urveyor who had the &s;uperintendance of her e&s;tates, to enquire how &s;oon her own hou&s;e would be fit for her reception; and heard there was yet work for near two months.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer made her very uncomforta|ble. To continue two months under the roof with Lady Margaret was a penance &s;he could not enjoin her&s;elf, nor was &s;he at all &s;ure Lady Margaret would &s;ubmit to it any better: &s;he determined, therefore, to re|lea&s;e her&s;elf from the con&s;cious burthen of being an unwelcome vi&s;itor, by boarding with &s;ome creditable family at Bury, and devoting the two months in which &s;he was to be kept from her hou&s;e, to a general ar|rangement of her affairs, and a final &s;ettling with her guardians.</P>
<P>For the&s;e purpo&s;es it would be nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould go to London: but with whom, or in what manner, &s;he could not decide. She de&s;ired, therefore, another conference with Mr. Monckton, who met her in the parlour.</P>
<P>She then communicated to him her &s;chemes; and begged his coun&s;el in her perplexities.</P>
<P>He was delighted at the application, and extremely well plea&s;ed with her de&s;ign of
<PB N="5" REF="4">
boarding at Bury, well knowing, he could then watch and vi&s;it her at his plea&s;ure, and have far more comfort in her &s;ociety than even in his own hou&s;e, where all the vigi|lance with which he ob&s;erved her, was &s;hort of that with which he was him&s;elf ob&s;erved by Lady Margaret. He endeavoured, how|ever, to di&s;&s;uade her from going to town, but her eagerne&s;s to pay the large &s;um &s;he owed him, was now too great to be con|quered. Of age, her fortune wholly in her power, and all attendance upon Mrs. Charl|ton at an end, &s;he had no longer any excu&s;e for having a debt in the world, and would &s;uffer no per&s;ua&s;ion to make her begin her career in life, with a negligence in &s;ettling her accounts which &s;he had &s;o often cen|&s;ured in others. To go to London there|fore &s;he was fixed, and all that &s;he de&s;ired was his advice concerning the journey.</P>
<P>He then told her that in order to &s;ettle with her guardians, &s;he mu&s;t write to them in form, to demand an account of the &s;ums that had been expended during her minority, and announce her intention for the future to take the management of her fortune into her own hands.</P>
<P>She immediately followed his directions, and con&s;ented to remain at the grove till their an&s;wers arrived.</P>
<P>Being now, therefore, unavoidably fixed
<PB N="6" REF="5">
for &s;ome time at the hou&s;e, &s;he thought it proper and decent to attempt &s;oftening Lady Margaret in her favour. She exerted all her powers to plea&s;e and to oblige her; but the exertion was nece&s;&s;arily vain, not only from the di&s;po&s;ition, but the &s;ituation of her lady&s;hip, &s;ince every effort made for this conciliatory purpo&s;e, rendered her doubly amiable in the eyes of her hu&s;band, and con&s;equently to her&s;elf more odious than ever. Her jealou&s;y, already but too well founded, received every hour the poi|&s;onous nouri&s;hment of fre&s;h conviction, which &s;o much &s;oured and exa&s;perated a temper naturally har&s;h, that her malignity and ill-humour grew daily more acrimo|nious. Nor would &s;he have contented her|&s;elf with di&s;playing this ira&s;cibility by ge|neral moro&s;ene&s;s, had not the &s;ame &s;u&s;picious watchfulne&s;s which di&s;covered to her the pa&s;|&s;ion of her hu&s;band, &s;erved equally to make manife&s;t the indifference and innocence of Cecilia; to reproach her therefore, &s;he had not any pretence, though her knowledge how much &s;he had to dread her, pa&s;t cur|rent in her mind for &s;ufficient rea&s;on to hate her. The Angry and the Violent u&s;e little di&s;crimination; whom they like, they en|quire not if they approve; but whoever, no matter how unwittingly, &s;tands in their way,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
they &s;cruple not to ill u&s;e, and conclude they may laudably dete&s;t.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though much di&s;gu&s;ted, gave not over her attempt, which &s;he con&s;idered but as her due while &s;he continued in her hou&s;e. Her general character, al&s;o, for peevi&s;hne&s;s and haughty ill-breeding, &s;kil|fully, from time to time, di&s;played, and artfully repined at by Mr. Monckton, &s;till kept her from &s;u&s;pecting any peculiar ani|mo&s;ity to her&s;elf, and made her impute all that pa&s;&s;ed to the mere rancour of ill-hu|mour. She confined her&s;elf, however, as much as po&s;&s;ible to her own apartment, where her &s;orrow for Mrs. Charlton almo&s;t hourly encrea&s;ed, by the compari&s;on &s;he was forced upon making of her hou&s;e with the grove.</P>
<P>That worthy old lady left her grand|daughters her co-heire&s;&s;es and &s;ole execu|trixes. She bequeathed from them nothing con&s;iderable, though &s;he left &s;ome donations for the poor, and &s;everal of her friends were remembered by &s;mall legacies. Among them Cecilia had her picture, and favourite trinkets, with a paragraph in her will, that as there was no one &s;he &s;o much loved, had her fortune been le&s;s &s;plendid, &s;he &s;hould have &s;hared with her grand-daughters what|ever &s;he had to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Cecilia was much affected by this la&s;t and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
&s;olemn remembrance. She more than ever coveted to be alone, that &s;he might grieve undi&s;turbed, and &s;he lamented without cea&s;|ing the fatigue and the illne&s;s which, in &s;o late a period, at it proved, of her life, &s;he had her&s;elf been the means of occa&s;ioning to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton had too much prudence to interrupt this de&s;ire of &s;olitude, which indeed co&s;t him little pain, as he con&s;idered her lea&s;t in danger when alone. She re|ceived in about a week an&s;wers from both her guardians. Mr. Delvile's letter was clo&s;ely to the purpo&s;e, without a word but of bu&s;ine&s;s, and couched in the haughtie&s;t terms. As he had never, he &s;aid, acted, he had no accounts to &s;end in; but as he was going to town in a few days, he would &s;ee her for a moment in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Briggs, that a joint relea&s;e might be &s;igned, to prevent any future application to him.</P>
<P>Cecilia much lamented there was any nece&s;&s;ity for her &s;eeing him at all, and looked forward to the interview as the greate&s;t mor|tification &s;he could &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Mr. Briggs, though &s;till more conci&s;e, was far kinder in his language: but he ad|vi&s;ed her to defer her &s;cheme of taking the money into her own hands, a&s;&s;uring her &s;he would be cheated, and had better leave it to him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
When &s;he communicated the&s;e epi&s;tles to Mr. Monckton, he failed not to read, with an empha&s;is, by which his arrogant meaning was &s;till more arrogantly enforced, the letter of Mr. Delvile aloud. Nor was he &s;paring in comments that might render it yet more offen&s;ive. Cecilia neither concurred in what he &s;aid, nor oppo&s;ed it, but contented her|&s;elf, when he was &s;ilent, with producing the other letter.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton read not this with more favour. He openly attacked the character of Briggs, as covetous, rapacious, and over|reaching, and warned her by no means to abide by his coun&s;el, without fir&s;t taking the opinion of &s;ome di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;on. He then &s;tated the various arts which might be practi&s;ed upon her inexperience, enumerat|ed the dangers to which her ignorance of bu&s;ine&s;s expo&s;ed her, and annotated upon the cheats, double dealings, and tricks of &s;tock jobbing, to which he a&s;&s;ured her Mr. Briggs owed all he was worth, till, per|plexed and confounded, &s;he declared her|&s;elf at a lo&s;s how to proceed, and earne&s;tly regretted that &s;he could not have his coun|&s;el upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>This was his aim: to draw the wi&s;h from her, drew all &s;u&s;picion of &s;elfi&s;h views from him&s;elf: and he told her that he con|&s;idered her pre&s;ent &s;ituation as &s;o critical,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the future confu&s;ion or regularity of her money tran&s;actions &s;eeming to depend upon it, that he would endeavour to arrange his affairs for meeting her in London.</P>
<P>Cecilia gave him many thanks for the kind intention, and determined to be to|tally guided by him in the di&s;po&s;al and di|rection of her fortune.</P>
<P>Mean time he had now another part to act; he &s;aw that with Cecilia nothing more remained to be done, and that, harbouring not a doubt of his motives, &s;he thought his de&s;ign in her favour did her nothing but honour; but he had too much knowledge of the world to believe it would judge him in the &s;ame manner, and too much con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of duplicity to &s;et its judgment at defiance. To parry, therefore, the con|jectures which might follow his attending her, he had already prepared Lady Marga|ret to wi&s;h her&s;elf of the party: for how|ever di&s;agreeable to him was her pre&s;ence and her company, he had no other means to be under the &s;ame roof with Cecilia.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bennet, the wretched tool of his various &s;chemes, and the mean &s;ycophant of his lady, had been employed by him to work upon her jealou&s;y, by &s;ecretly inform|ing her of his intention to go to town, at the &s;ame time that Cecilia went thither to meet her guardians. She pretended to have
<PB N="11" REF="10">
learned this intelligence by accident, and to communicate it from re&s;pectful regard; and advi&s;ed her to go to London her&s;elf at the &s;ame time, that &s;he might &s;ee into his de|&s;igns, and be &s;ome check upon his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The encrea&s;ing infirmities of Lady Mar|garet made this coun&s;el by no means palat|able: but Mi&s;s Bennet, following the artful in&s;tructions which &s;he received, put in her way &s;o &s;trong a motive, by a&s;&s;uring her how little her company was wi&s;hed, that in the madne&s;s of her &s;pite &s;he determined upon the journey. And little heeding how &s;he tormented her&s;elf while &s;he had any view of tormenting Mr. Monckton, &s;he was led on by her fal&s;e confident to invite Cecilia to her town hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, in whom by long prac|tice, artifice was almo&s;t nature, well know|ing his wife's perver&s;ene&s;s, affected to look much di&s;concerted at the propo&s;al; while Cecilia, by no means thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to extend her compliance to &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment, in&s;tantly made an apology, and de|clined the invitation.</P>
<P>Lady Margaret, little ver&s;ed in civility, and unu&s;ed to the arts of per&s;ua&s;ion, could not, even for a favourite project, prevail upon her&s;elf to u&s;e entreaty, and therefore, thinking her &s;cheme defeated, looked gloo|mily di&s;appointed, and &s;aid nothing more.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
Mr. Monckton, &s;aw with delight how much this difficulty inflamed her, though the moment he could &s;peak alone with Cecilia he made it his care to remove it.</P>
<P>He repre&s;ented to her that, however pri|vately &s;he might live, &s;he was too young to be in London lodgings by her&s;elf, and gave an hint which &s;he could not but under&s;tand, that in going or in &s;taying with only &s;er|vants, &s;u&s;picions might &s;oon be rai&s;ed, that the plan and motive of her journey were different to tho&s;e given out.</P>
<P>She knew he meant to in&s;inuate that it would be conjectured &s;he de&s;igned to meet Delvile, and though colouring, vext and provoked at the &s;ugge&s;tion, the idea was &s;ufficient to frighten her into his plan.</P>
<P>In a few days, therefore, the matter was wholly arranged, Mr. Monckton, by his &s;kill and addre&s;s, leading every one whi|ther he plea&s;ed, while, by the artful coolne&s;s of his manner, he appeared but to follow him&s;elf. He &s;at out the day before, though earne&s;tly wi&s;hing to accompany them, but having as yet in no &s;ingle in&s;tance gone to town in the &s;ame carriage with Lady Mar|garet, he dared tru&s;t neither the neighbour|hood nor the &s;ervants with &s;o dangerous a &s;ubject for their comments.</P>
<P>Cecilia, compelled thus to travel with only her Lady&s;hip and Mi&s;s Bennet, had a
<PB N="13" REF="12">
journey the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable, and deter|mined, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;tay in London but two days. She had already fixed upon a hou&s;e in which &s;he could board at Bury when &s;he returned, and there &s;he meant quietly to re&s;ide till &s;he could enter her own.</P>
<P>Lady Margaret her&s;elf, exhilarated by a notion of having outwitted her hu&s;band, was in unu&s;ual good &s;pirits, and almo&s;t in good humour. The idea of thwarting his de&s;igns, and being in the way of his en|tertainment, gave to her a delight &s;he had &s;eldom received from any thing; and the belief that this was effected by the &s;upe|riority of her cunning, doubled her con|tentment, and rai&s;ed it to exultation. She owed him, indeed, much provocation and unea&s;ine&s;s, and was happy in this opportu|nity of paying her arrears.</P>
<P>Mean while that con&s;ummate ma&s;ter in every &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y, indulged her in this notion, by the air of di&s;&s;atisfaction with which he left the hou&s;e. It was not that &s;he meant by her pre&s;ence to obviate any im|propriety: early and long acquainted with the character of Cecilia, &s;he well knew, that during her life the pa&s;&s;ion of her hu&s;band mu&s;t be confined to his own brea&s;t: but con&s;cious of his aver&s;ion to her&s;elf, which &s;he re&s;ented with the bittere&s;t ill-will, and
<PB N="14" REF="13">
knowing how little, at any time, he de&s;ired her company, &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf for her inability to give plea&s;ure by the power &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of giving pain, and bore with the fatigue of a journey di&s;agreeable and incon|venient to her, with no other view than the hope of breaking into his plan of avoiding her. Little imagining that the whole time &s;he was forwaring his favourite pur&s;uit, and only acting the part which he had ap|pointed her to perform.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A SURPRIZE.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Margaret's town hou&s;e was in Soho Square; and &s;carcely had Cecilia entered it, before her de&s;ire to &s;peed her departure, made her &s;end a note to each of her guardians, acquainting them of her ar|rival, and begging, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ee them the next day.</P>
<P>She had &s;oon the two following an&s;wers:</P>

<P>Mr. Delvile has too many affairs of im|portance upon his hands, to make any appointment

<CLOSER><DATELINE>St. James's-Square, <DATE>Nov. 8.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The&s;e characteri&s;tic letters, which at ano|ther time might have diverted Cecilia, now merely &s;erved to torment her. She was eager to quit town, &s;he was more eager to have her meeting with Mr. Delvile over, who, oppre&s;&s;ive to her even when he meant to be kind, &s;he fore&s;aw, now he was in wrath, would be imperious even to rude|ne&s;s. De&s;irous, however, to make one in|terview &s;uffice for both, and to &s;ettle what|ever bu&s;ine&s;s might remain unfini&s;hed by letters, &s;he again wrote to Mr. Briggs, whom &s;he had not &s;pirits to encounter with|out ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, and informing him of Mr. Delvile's delay, begged he would not trouble him&s;elf to call till he heard from her adain.</P>
<P>Two days pa&s;&s;ed without any me&s;&s;age from them; they were &s;pent chiefly alone, and very uncomfortably, Mr. Monckton being content to &s;ee little of her, while he knew &s;he &s;aw nothing of any body el&s;e. On the third morning, weary of her own thoughts, weary of Lady Margaret's ill|humoured looks, and &s;till more weary of
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Mi&s;s Bennet's para&s;itical conver&s;ation, &s;he determined, for a little relief to the heavi|ne&s;s of her mind, to go to her book|&s;eller, and look over and order into the country &s;uch new publications as &s;eemed to promi&s;e her any plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>She &s;ent therefore, for a chair, and glad to have devi&s;ed for her&s;elf any amu&s;ement, &s;et out in it immediately.</P>
<P>Upon entering the &s;hop, &s;he &s;aw the Book|&s;eller engaged in clo&s;e conference with a man meanly dre&s;&s;ed, and much muffled up, who &s;eemed talking to him with uncommon earne&s;tne&s;s, and ju&s;t as &s;he was approaching, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To terms I am indifferent, for writ|ing is no labour to me; on the contrary, it is the fir&s;t delight of my life, and therefore, and not for dirty pelf, I wi&s;h to make it my profe&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;peech &s;truck Cecilia, but the voice &s;truck her more, it was Belfield's! and her amazement was &s;o great, that &s;he &s;topt &s;hort to look at him, without heeding a man who attended her, and de&s;ired to know her com|mands.</P>
<P>The book&s;eller now perceiving her, came forward, and Belfield, turning to &s;ee who interrupted them, &s;tarted as if a &s;pectre had cro&s;&s;ed his eyes, flapped his hat over his face, and ha&s;tily went out of the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Cecilia checking her inclination to &s;peak
<PB N="18" REF="17">
to him, from ob&s;erving his eagerne&s;s to e&s;cape her, &s;oon recollected her own errand, and employed her&s;elf in looking over new books.</P>
<P>Her &s;urprize, however, at a change &s;o &s;udden in the condition of this young man, and at a declaration of a pa&s;&s;ion for writing, &s;o oppo&s;ite to all the &s;entiments which he had profe&s;&s;ed at their late meeting in the cottage, awakened in her a &s;trong curio&s;ity to be informed of his &s;ituation; and after putting a&s;ide &s;ome books which &s;he de&s;ired to have packed up for her, &s;he a&s;ked if the gentleman who had ju&s;t left the &s;hop, and who, &s;he found by what he had &s;aid, was an Author, had written any thing that was publi&s;hed with his name?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered the Book&s;el|ler, <Q REND="inline">"nothing of any con&s;equence; he is known, however, to have written &s;everal things that have appeared as anonymous; and I fancy, now, &s;oon, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome|thing con&s;iderable from him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is about &s;ome great work, then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why no, not exactly that, perhaps, at pre&s;ent; we mu&s;t feel our way, with &s;ome little &s;mart <HI>jeu d'e&s;prit</HI> before we undertake a great work. But he is a very great genius, and I doubt not will produce &s;ome|thing extraordinary."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever he produces,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<Q REND="inline">"as I have now chanced to &s;ee him, I &s;hall be glad you will, at any time, &s;end to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, ma'am; but it mu&s;t be among other things, for he does not chu&s;e, ju&s;t now, to be known: and it is a rule in our bu&s;ine&s;s never to tell people's names when they de&s;ire to be &s;ecret. He is a lit|tle out of ca&s;h, ju&s;t now, as you may &s;up|po&s;e by his appearance, &s;o in&s;tead of buy|ing books, he comes to &s;ell them. How|ever, he has taken a very good road to bring him&s;elf home again, for we pay very hand&s;omely for things of any merit, e&s;pe|cially if they deal &s;martly in a few touches of the times."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia cho&s;e not to ri&s;k any further que&s;|tions, le&s;t her knowledge of him &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, but got into her chair, and re|turned to Lady Margaret's.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of Belfield reminded her not only of him&s;elf; the gentle Henrietta again took her place in her memory, whence her various di&s;tre&s;&s;es and &s;u&s;pences had of late driven from it every body but Delvile, and tho&s;e whom Delvile brought into it. But her regard for that amiable girl, though &s;unk in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of her calamitous uncertainties, was only &s;unk in her own bo&s;om, and ready, upon their removal, to revive with fre&s;h vigour. She was now in|deed more unhappy than even in the period
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of her forgetfulne&s;s, yet her mind was no longer filled with the re&s;tle&s;s turbulence of hope, which &s;till more than de&s;pondency unfitted it for thinking of others.</P>
<P>This remembrance thus awakened, a|wakened al&s;o a de&s;ire of renewing the con|nection &s;o long neglected. All &s;cruples concerning Delvile had now lo&s;t their foun|dation, &s;ince the doubts from which they aro&s;e were both explained and removed: &s;he was certain alike of his indifference to Henrietta, and his &s;eparation from her&s;elf; &s;he knew that nothing was to be feared from painful or offen&s;ive rivalry, and &s;he re&s;olved, therefore, to lo&s;e no time in &s;eeking the fir&s;t plea&s;ure to which &s;ince her di&s;appointment &s;he had voluntarily looked forward.</P>
<P>Early in the evening, &s;he told Lady Mar|garet &s;he was going out for an hour or two, and &s;ending again for a chair, was carried to Portland-Street.</P>
<P>She enquired for Mi&s;s Belfield, and was &s;hewn into a parlour, where &s;he found her drinking tea with her mother, and Mr. Hob&s;on, their landlord.</P>
<P>Henrietta almo&s;t &s;creamed at her &s;ight, from a &s;udden impul&s;e of joy and &s;urprize, and, running up to her, flung her arms round her neck, and embraced her with the mo&s;t rapturous emotion: but then, drawing back with a look of timidity and &s;hame,

&s;he ba&s;hfully apologized for her freedom, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley, it is no want of re&s;pect, but I am &s;o very glad to &s;ee you it makes me quite forget my&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, charmed at a reception &s;o in|genuou&s;ly affectionate, &s;oon &s;atisfied her doubting diffidence by the warme&s;t thanks that &s;he had pre&s;erved &s;o much regard for her, and by doubling the kindne&s;s with which &s;he returned her care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mercy on me, madam,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, who during this time had been bu&s;ily employed in &s;weeping the hearth, wiping &s;ome &s;lops upon the table, and &s;moothing her handkerchief and apron, <Q REND="inline">"why the girl's enough to &s;mother you.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Henriet|ta, again retreating, <Q REND="inline">"is &s;o kind as to par|don me, and I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing her, that I hardly knew what I was about."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The young ladies, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"have a mighty way of &s;aluting one another till &s;uch time as they get hu&s;|bands: and then I'll warrant you they can meet without any &s;alutation at all. That's my remark, at lea&s;t, and what I've &s;een of the world has &s;et me upon making it."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech led Cecilia to check, however
<PB N="22" REF="21">
artle&s;s, the tenderne&s;s of her fervent young friend, whom &s;he was much teized by meeting in &s;uch company, but who &s;eemed not to dare under&s;tand the frequent looks which &s;he gave her expre&s;&s;ive of a wi&s;h to be alone with her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, ladies,"</Q> continued the facetious Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"what if we were all to &s;it down, and have a good di&s;h of tea? and &s;uppo&s;e, Mrs. Belfield, you was to order us a fre&s;h round of toa&s;t and butter? do you think the young ladies here would have any objection? and what if we were to have a little more water in the tea-kettle? not forgetting a little more tea in the tea|pot. What I &s;ay is this, let us all be com|fortable; that's my notion of things."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And a very good notion too,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"for you who have nothing to vex you. Ah, ma'am, you have heard, I &s;uppo&s;e, about my &s;on? gone off! no|body knows where! left that lord's hou&s;e, where he might have lived like a king, and gone out into the wide world nobody knows for what!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who, from &s;ee|ing him in London concluded he was again with his family, <Q REND="inline">"and has he not acquainted you where he is?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am, no,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">he's never once told me where he is gone,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
nor let me know the lea&s;t about the matter, for if I did I would not ta&s;te a di&s;h of tea again for a twelvemonth till I &s;aw him get back again to that lord's! and I believe in my heart there's never &s;uch another in the three kingdoms, for he has &s;ent here after him I dare &s;ay a &s;core of times. And no wonder, for I will take upon me to &s;ay he won't find his fellow in a hurry, Lord as he is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to his being a Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I am one of them that lay no great &s;tre&s;s upon that, unle&s;s he has got a good long pur&s;e of his own, and then, to be &s;ure, a Lord's no bad thing. But as to the matter of &s;aying Lord &s;uch a one, how d'ye do? and Lord &s;uch a one, what do you want? and &s;uch &s;ort of compliments, why in my mind, it's a mere nothing, in com|pari&s;on of a good income. As to your &s;on, ma'am, he did not go the right way to work. He &s;hould have begun with bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and gone into plea&s;ure afterwards: and if he had but done that, I'll be bold to &s;ay we might have had him at this very minute drinking tea with us over this fire|&s;ide."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield, rather angrily, <Q REND="inline">"was another &s;ort of a per&s;on than a per&s;on of bu&s;ine&s;s: he always de&s;pi&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="23">
it from a child, and come of it what may, I am &s;ure he was born to be a gentleman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to his de&s;pi&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, very contemptuou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"why &s;o much the wor&s;e, for bu&s;ine&s;s is no &s;uch de|&s;pi&s;eable thing. And if he had been brought up behind a counter, in&s;tead of dangling after the&s;e &s;ame Lords, why he might have had a hou&s;e of his own over his head, and been as good a man as my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A hou&s;e over his head?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"why he might have had what he would, and have done what he would, if he had but followed my advice, and put him&s;elf a little forward. I have told him a hundred times to a&s;k &s;ome of tho&s;e great people he lived among&s;t for a place at court, for I know they've &s;o many they hardly know what to do with them, and it was always my de&s;ign from the beginning that he &s;hould be &s;omething of a great man; but I never could per&s;uade him, though, for any thing I know, as I have often told him, if he had but had a little courage he might have been an Amba&s;&s;ador by this time. And now, all of a &s;udden, to be gone nobody knows where!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who knew not whether mo&s;t to pity or wonder at her blind folly; <Q REND="inline">"but I doubt not you will hear of him &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
<Q REND="inline">"As to being an Amba&s;&s;ador, ma'am"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"it's talking quite out of character. Tho&s;e &s;ort of great people keep things of that kind for their own poor relations and cou&s;ins. What I &s;ay is this; a man's be&s;t way is to take care of him&s;elf. The more tho&s;e great people &s;ee you want them, the le&s;s they like your company. Let every man be brought up to bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and then when he's made his for|tune, he may walk with his hat on. Why now there was your friend, ma'am,"</Q> turn|ing to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;hot out his brains without paying any body a &s;ou&s;e; pray how was that being more genteel than &s;tanding behind a counter, and not owing a &s;hilling?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you think a young lady,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield warmly, <Q REND="inline">"can bear to hear of &s;uch a thing as &s;tanding behind a counter? I am &s;ure if my &s;on had ever done it, I &s;hould not expect any lady would &s;o much as look at him. And yet, though I &s;ay it, &s;he might look a good while, and not &s;ee many &s;uch per&s;ons, let her look where &s;he plea&s;ed. And then he has &s;uch a winning manner into the bargain, that I believe in my heart there's never a lady in the land could &s;ay no to him. And yet he has &s;uch a prodigious &s;hyne&s;s, I never could make him own he had &s;o much as
<PB N="26" REF="25">
a&s;ked the que&s;tion. And what lady can begin fir&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why no,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"that would be out of character another way. Now my notion is this; let every man be agreeable! and then he may a&s;k what lady he plea&s;es. And when he's a mind of a lady, he &s;hould look upon a frown or two as nothing; for the ladies frown in court|&s;hip as a thing of cour&s;e; it's ju&s;t like a man's &s;wearing at a coachman; why he's not a bit more in a pa&s;&s;ion, only he thinks he &s;ha'n't be minded without it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, for my part,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Bel|field, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure if I was a young lady, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially if I was a young lady of fortune, and all that, I &s;hould like a mode&s;t young gentleman, &s;uch as my &s;on, for example, better by half than a bold &s;wearing young fellow, that would make a point to have me whether I would or no."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha! Ha! Ha!"</Q> cried Mr. Hob&s;on; <Q REND="inline">"but the young ladies are not of that way of thinking; they are all for a little life and &s;pirit. Don't I &s;ay right, young ladies?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who could not but perceive that the&s;e &s;peeches was levelled at her&s;elf, felt offended and tired; and finding &s;he had no chance of any private conver&s;ation with Henrietta, aro&s;e to take leave: but while
<PB N="27" REF="26">
&s;he &s;topped in the pa&s;&s;age to enquire when &s;he could &s;ee her alone, a footman knocked at the door, who, having a&s;ked if Mr. Belfield lodged there, and been an&s;wered in the affirmative, begged to know whether Mi&s;s Beverley was then in the hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Cecilia, much &s;urpri&s;ed, went forward, and told him who &s;he was.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have been, madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"with a me&s;&s;age to you at Mr. Monckton's, in Soho-Square: but nobody knew where you was; and Mr. Monckton came out and &s;poke to me him&s;elf, and &s;aid that all he could &s;uppo&s;e was that you might be at this hou&s;e. So he directed me to come here."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And from whom, Sir, is your me&s;|&s;age?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From the honourable Mr. Delvile, madam, in St. James's-Square. He de&s;ires to know if you &s;hall be at home on Satur|day morning, the day after to-morrow, and whether you can appoint Mr. Briggs to meet him by twelve o'clock exactly, as he &s;ha'n't be able to &s;tay above three minutes."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia gave an an&s;wer as cold as the me&s;&s;age; that &s;he would be in Soho-Square at the time he mentioned, and acquaint Mr. Briggs of his intention.</P>
<P>The footman then went away; and Henriet|ta told her, that if &s;he could call &s;ome morn|ing &s;he might perhaps contrive to be alone
<PB N="28" REF="27">
with her, and added, <Q REND="inline">"indeed I wi&s;h much to &s;ee you, if you could po&s;&s;ibly do me &s;o great an honour; for I am very mi&s;erable, and have nobody to tell &s;o! Ah, Mi&s;s Be|verley! you that have &s;o many friends, and that de&s;erve as many again, you little know what a hard thing it is to have none!&mdash;but my brother's &s;trange di&s;appearing has half broke our hearts!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was beginning a con&s;olatory &s;peech, in which &s;he meant to give her pri|vate a&s;&s;urances of his health and &s;afety, when &s;he was interrupted by Mr. Albany, who came &s;uddenly into the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Henrietta received him with a look of plea&s;ure, and enquired why he had &s;o long been ab&s;ent; but, &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ight of Cecilia, he exclaimed, without an&s;wering her, <Q REND="inline">"why did&s;t thou fail me? why ap|point me to a place thou wert quitting thy|&s;elf?&mdash;thou thing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">air profe&s;&s;ions! thou inveigler of e&s;teem! thou vain, delu&s;ive promi&s;er of plea&s;ure!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You condemn me too ha&s;tily,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"if I failed in my promi&s;e, it was not owing to caprice or in&s;incerity, but to real and bitter misfortune which incapa|citated me from keeping it. I &s;hall &s;oon, however,&mdash;nay, I am already at your di&s;|po&s;al, if you have any commands for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have always,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"commands
<PB N="29" REF="28">
for the rich, for I have always com|pa&s;&s;ion for the poor."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come to me, then, at Mr. Monck|ton's in Soho-Square,"</Q> cried &s;he, and ha&s;|tened into her chair, impatient to end a con|ference which &s;he &s;aw excited the wonder of the &s;ervants, and which al&s;o now drew out from the parlour Mr. Hob&s;on and Mrs. Belfield. She then ki&s;&s;ed her hand to Hen|rietta, and ordered the chairmen to carry her home.</P>
<P>It had not been without difficulty that &s;he had re&s;trained her&s;elf from mentioning what &s;he knew of Belfield, when &s;he found his mother and &s;i&s;ter in a &s;tate of &s;uch pain|ful uncertainty concerning him. But her utter ignorance of his plans, joined to her undoubted knowledge of his wi&s;h of con|cealment, made her fear doing mi&s;chief by officiou&s;ne&s;s, and think it wi&s;er not to be|tray what &s;he had &s;een of him, till better informed of his own views and intentions. Yet, willing to &s;horten a &s;u&s;pence &s;o un|ea&s;y to them, &s;he determined to entreat Mr. Monckton would endeavour to find him out, and acquaint him with their anxiety.</P>
<P>That gentleman, when &s;he returned to his hou&s;e, was in a &s;tate of mind by no means enviable. Mi&s;&s;ing her at tea, he had a&s;ked Mi&s;s Bennet where &s;he was, and hearing
<PB N="30" REF="29">
&s;he had not left word, he could &s;carce conceal his chagrin. Knowing, however, how few were her acquaintances in town, he &s;oon concluded &s;he was with Mi&s;s Bel|field, but, not &s;atisfied with &s;ending Mr. Delvile's me&s;&s;enger after her, he privately employed one in whom he tru&s;ted for him|&s;elf, to make enquiries at the hou&s;e without &s;aying whence he came.</P>
<P>But though this man was returned, and he knew her &s;afety, he &s;till felt alarmed; he had flattered him&s;elf, from the length of time in which &s;he had now done nothing without con&s;ulting him, &s;he would &s;carce even think of any action without his pre|vious concurrence. And he had hoped, by a little longer u&s;e, to make his coun&s;el become nece&s;&s;ary, which he knew to be a very &s;hort &s;tep from rendering it ab&s;o|lute.</P>
<P>Nor was he well plea&s;ed to perceive, by this voluntary excur&s;ion, a &s;truggle to ca&s;t off her &s;adne&s;s, and a wi&s;h to procure her|&s;elf entertainment: it was not that he de|&s;ired her mi&s;ery, but he was earne&s;t that all relief from it &s;hould &s;pring from him&s;elf: and though far from di&s;plea&s;ed that Delvile &s;hould lo&s;e his &s;overeignty over her thoughts, he was yet of opinion that, till his own liberty was re&s;tored, he had le&s;s to appre|hend from grief indulged, than grief allayed;
<PB N="31" REF="30">
one could but lead her to repining retirement, the other might guide her to a con&s;olatory rival.</P>
<P>He well knew, however, it was as e&s;|&s;ential to his cau&s;e to di&s;gui&s;e his di&s;ap|pointments as his expectations, and, certain that by plea&s;ing alone he had any chance of acquiring power, he cleared up when Ceci|lia returned, who as uncon&s;cious of feeling, as of owing any &s;ubjection to him, pre|&s;erved uncontrolled the right of acting for her&s;elf, however de&s;irous and glad of oc|ca&s;ional in&s;truction.</P>
<P>She told him where &s;he had been, and related her meeting Belfield, and the un|happine&s;s of his friends, and hinted her wi&s;h that he could be informed what they &s;uffered. Mr. Monckton, eager to oblige her, went in&s;tantly in &s;earch of him, and returning to &s;upper, told her he had traced him through the Book&s;eller, who had not the dexterity to parry his artful enquiries, and had actually appointed him to break|fa&s;t in Soho-Square the next morning.</P>
<P>He had found him, he &s;aid, writing, but in high &s;pirits and good humour. He had re&s;i&s;ted, for a while, his invitation on ac|count of his dre&s;s, all his clothes but the very coat which he had on being packed up and at his mother's: but, when laughed at by Mr. Monckton for &s;till retaining &s;ome foppery,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
he gayly prote&s;ted what remained of it &s;hould be extingui&s;hed; and acknow|ledging that his &s;hame was no part of his philo&s;ophy, declared he would throw it wholly a&s;ide, and, in &s;pite of his degrada|tion, renew his vi&s;its at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would not tell him,"</Q> Mr. Monckton continued, <Q REND="inline">"of the anxiety of his family; I thought it would come more powerfully from your&s;elf, who, having &s;een, can bet|ter enforce it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was very thankful for this com|pliance with her reque&s;t, and anticipated the plea&s;ure &s;he hoped &s;oon to give Hen|rietta, by the re&s;toration of a brother &s;o much loved and &s;o regretted.</P>
<P>She &s;ent, mean time, to Mr. Briggs the me&s;&s;age &s;he had received from Mr. Delvile, and had the &s;atisfaction of an an&s;wer that he would ob&s;erve the appointment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A CONFABULATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, while the family was at breakfa&s;t, Belfield, according to his promi&s;e, made his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>A high colour over&s;pread his face as he entered the room, re&s;ulting from a &s;en&s;a|tion of grief at his fallen fortune, and &s;hame at his altered appearance, which though he endeavoured to cover under an air of gaiety and unconcern, gave an awkwardne&s;s to his manners, and a vi&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s to his coun|tenance: Mr. Monckton received him with plea&s;ure, and Cecilia, who &s;aw the conflict of his philo&s;ophy with his pride, dre&s;&s;ed her features once more in &s;miles, which however faint and heartle&s;s, &s;hewed her de&s;ire to re-a&s;&s;ure him. Mi&s;s Bennet, as u&s;ual when not called upon by the ma&s;ter or lady of the hou&s;e, &s;at as a cypher; and Lady Margaret, always di&s;agreeable and repul&s;ive to the friends of her hu&s;band, though &s;he was not now more than com|monly ungracious, &s;truck the quick-feeling and irritable Belfield, to wear an air of rude
<PB N="34" REF="33">
&s;uperiority meant to reproach him with his di&s;grace.</P>
<P>This notion, which &s;trongly affected him, made him, for one in&s;tant, he&s;itate whether he &s;hould remain another in the &s;ame room with her: but the friendline&s;s of Mr. Monckton, and the gentlene&s;s and good breeding of Cecilia, &s;eemed &s;o &s;tudious to make amends for her moro&s;ene&s;s, that he checked his too ready indignation, and took his &s;eat at the table. Yet was it &s;ome time before he could recover even the a&s;&s;umed vivacity which this &s;u&s;pected in&s;ult had robbed him of, &s;ufficiently to enter into conver&s;ation with any appearance of ea&s;e or plea&s;ure. But, after a while, &s;oothed by the attentions of Cecilia and Mr. Monck|ton, his unea&s;ine&s;s wore off, and the native &s;pirit and liveline&s;s of his character broke forth with their accu&s;tomed energy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This good company, I hope,"</Q> &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, however, only to Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"will not &s;o much <HI>mi&s;take the thing</HI> as to critici&s;e my dre&s;s of this morning; &s;ince it is perfectly according to rule, and to rule e&s;tabli&s;hed from time immemo|rial: but le&s;t any of you &s;hould &s;o much err as to fancy &s;habby what is only charac|teri&s;tic, I mu&s;t endeavour to be beforehand with the malice of conjecture, and have the honour to inform you, that I am enli&s;ted in

It has been &s;o with me; I have &s;ought it at a di&s;tance, amid&s;t difficulty and danger, when all that I could wi&s;h has been immediately within my gra&s;p."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t be owned,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monck|ton, <Q REND="inline">"after what you have &s;uffered from this world you were wont to defend, there is little rea&s;on to wonder at &s;ome change in your opinion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet whatever have been my &s;ufferings,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I have generally been in|volved in them by my own ra&s;hne&s;s or ca|price.

for the experiment I was making, how ir|reparably I was enervated by long &s;edentary habits, and how in&s;ufficient for bodily &s;trength was mental re&s;olution.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you not then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince your experiment has failed, return again to your family, and to the plan of life you formerly &s;ettled?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak of them together,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"as if you thought them in|&s;eparable; and indeed my own apprehen&s;ion they would be deemed &s;o, has made me thus fear to &s;ee my friends, &s;ince I love not re&s;i&s;tance, yet cannot again attempt the plan of life they would have me pur&s;ue. I have given up my cottage, but my inde|pendence is as dear to me as ever; and all that I have gathered from experience, is to maintain it by tho&s;e employments for which my education has fitted me, in&s;tead of &s;eeking
<PB N="38" REF="37">
it injudiciou&s;ly by the very road for which it has unqualified me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what is this independence,"</Q> cried Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"which has thus bewitched your imagination? a mere idle dream of romance and enthu&s;ia&s;m; without exi&s;tence in nature, without po&s;&s;ibility in life. In uncivili&s;ed countries, or in lawle&s;s times, independence, for a while, may perhaps &s;talk abroad; but in a regular government, 'tis only the vi&s;ion of a heated brain; one part of a community mu&s;t inevitably hang upon another, and 'tis a farce to call either independent, when to break the chain by which they are linked would prove de&s;truc|tion to both. The &s;oldier wants not the officer more than the officer the &s;oldier, nor the tenant the landlord, more than the land|lord the tenant. The rich owe their di&s;|tinction, their luxuries, to the poor, as much as the poor owe their rewards, their nece&s;&s;a|ries, to the rich."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Man treated as an Automaton,"</Q> an|&s;wered Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"and con&s;idered merely with re&s;pect to his bodily operations, may indeed be called dependent, &s;ince the food by which he lives, or, rather, without which he dies, cannot wholly be cultivated and prepared by his own hands: but con&s;idered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n a nobler &s;en&s;e, he de&s;erves not the de|grading epithet; &s;peak of him, then, as a

being of feeling and under&s;tanding, with pride to alarm, with nerves to tremble, with honour to &s;atisfy, and with a &s;oul to be im|mortal!&mdash;as &s;uch, may he not claim the freedom of his own thoughts? may not that claim be extended to the liberty of &s;peak|ing, and the power of being governed by them? and when thoughts, words, and actions are exempt from controul, will you brand him with dependency merely becau&s;e the Grazier feeds his meat, and the Baker kneeds his bread?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But who is there in the whole world,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"exten&s;ive as it is, and di&s;&s;imilar as are it inhabitants, that can pretend to a&s;&s;ert, his thoughts, words, and actions, are exempt from controul? even where intere&s;t, which you &s;o much di&s;dain, interferes not,&mdash;though where that is I con|fe&s;s I cannot tell!&mdash;are we not kept &s;ilent where we wi&s;h to reprove by the fear of offending? and made &s;peak where we wi&s;h to be &s;ilent by the de&s;ire of obliging? do we not bow to the &s;coundrel as low as to the man of honour? are we not by mere forms kept &s;tanding when tired? made give place to tho&s;e we de&s;pi&s;e? and &s;miles to tho&s;e we hate? or if we refu&s;e the&s;e atten|tions, are we not regarded as &s;avages, and &s;hut out of &s;ociety?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All the&s;e,"</Q> an&s;wered Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"are
<PB N="40" REF="39">
&s;o merely matters of ceremony, that the conce&s;&s;ion can neither co&s;t pain to the proud, nor give plea&s;ure to the vain. The bow is to the coat, the attention is to the rank, and the fear of offending ought to extend to all mankind. Homage &s;uch as this infringes not our &s;incerity, &s;ince it is as much a mat|ter of cour&s;e as the dre&s;s that we wear, and has as little rea&s;on to flatter a man as the &s;hadow which follows him. I no more, therefore, hold him deceitful for not op|po&s;ing this pantomimical parade, than I hold him to be dependent for eating corn he has not &s;own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where, then, do you draw the line? and what is the boundary beyond which your independence mu&s;t not &s;tep?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hold that man,"</Q> cried he, with energy, <Q REND="inline">"to be independent, who treats the Great as the Little, and the Little as the Great, who neither exults in riches nor blu&s;hes in po|verty, who owes no man a groat, and who &s;pends not a &s;hilling he has not earned."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will not, indeed, then, have a very numerous acquaintance, if this is the de&s;cription of tho&s;e with whom you pur|po&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate! but is it po&s;&s;ible you imagine you can live by &s;uch notions? why the Carthu&s;ian in his mona&s;tery, who is at lea&s;t removed from temptation, is not mor|tified &s;o &s;everely as a man of &s;pirit living in
<PB N="41" REF="40">
the world, who would pre&s;cribe him&s;elf &s;uch rules."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not merely have I pre&s;cribed,"</Q> re|turned Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"I have already put them in practice; and far from finding any pen|nance, I never before found happine&s;s. I have now adopted, though poor, the very plan of life I &s;hould have elected if rich; my plea&s;ure, therefore, is become my bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and my bu&s;ine&s;s my plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is this plan,"</Q> cried Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"nothing more than turning Knight-errant to the Book&s;ellers?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis a Knight-errantry,"</Q> an&s;wered Bel|field, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"which, however ludicrous it may &s;eem to you, requires more &s;oul and more brains than any other. Our giants may, indeed, be only windmills, but they mu&s;t be attacked with as much &s;pirit, and con|quered with as much bravery, as any fort or any town, in time of war &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; and though the &s;iege, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, may be of le&s;s national utility, the a&s;&s;ailants of the quill have their honour as much at heart as the a&s;&s;ailants of the &s;word."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e then,"</Q> &s;aid Monckton, archly, <Q REND="inline">"if a man wants a biting lampoon, or an hand&s;ome panegyric, &s;ome news-paper &s;can|dal, or a a &s;onnet for a lady&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> interrupted Belfield eagerly,
<PB N="42" REF="41">
<Q REND="inline">"if you imagine me a hireling &s;cribble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the purpo&s;es of defamation or of flat|tery, you as little know my &s;ituation as my character. My &s;ubjects &s;hall be my own, and my &s;atire &s;hall be general. I would as much di&s;dain to be per&s;onal with an anony|mous pen, as to attack an unarmed man in the dark with a dagger I had kept con|cealed."</Q></P>
<P>A reply of rallying incredulity was ri&s;ing to the lips of Mr. Monckton, when read|ing in the looks of Cecilia an entire appro|bation of this &s;entiment, he checked his de&s;ire of ridicule, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"&s;poken like a man of honour, and one who&s;e works may profit the world!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From my earlie&s;t youth to the pre&s;ent hour,"</Q> continued Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"literature has been the favourite object of my pur&s;uit, my recreation in lei&s;ure, and my hope in em|ployment. My propen&s;ity to it, indeed, has been &s;o ungovernable, that I may pro|perly call it the &s;ource of my &s;everal mi&s;|carriages throughout life. It was the bar to my preferment, for it gave me a di&s;ta&s;te to other &s;tudies; it was the cau&s;e of my un&s;teadine&s;s in all my undertakings, becau&s;e to all I preferred it. It has &s;unk me to di&s;tre&s;s, it has involved me in difficulties; it has brought me to the brink of ruin by making me neglect the means of living,
<PB N="43" REF="42">
yet never, till now, did I di&s;cern it might it&s;elf be my &s;upport."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am heartily glad, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"your various enterprizes and &s;truggles have at length ended in a project which promi&s;es you &s;o much &s;atisfaction. But you will &s;urely &s;uffer your &s;i&s;ter and your mother to partake of it? for who is there that your pro&s;perity will make &s;o happy?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do them infinite honour, madam, by taking any intere&s;t in their affairs; but to own to you the truth, what to me appears pro&s;perity, will to them wear another a&s;|pect. They have looked forward to my elevation with expectations the mo&s;t impro|bable, and thought every thing within my gra&s;p, with a &s;implicity incredible. But though their hopes were ab&s;urd, I am pained by their di&s;appointment, and I have not courage to meet their tears, which I am &s;ure will not be &s;pared when they &s;ee me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis from tenderne&s;s, then,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, half &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"that you are cruel, and from affection to your friends that you make them believe you have forgotten them?"</Q></P>
<P>There was a delicacy in this reproach exactly &s;uited to work upon Belfield, who feeling it with quickne&s;s, &s;tarted up, and cried, <Q REND="inline">"I believe I am wrong!&mdash;I will go to them this moment!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
Cecilia felt eager to &s;econd the generous impul&s;e; but Mr. Monckton, laughing at his impetuo&s;ity, in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould fir&s;t fini&s;h his breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your friends,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"can have no mortification &s;o hard to bear as your voluntary ab&s;ence; and if they &s;ee but that you are happy, they will &s;oon be reconciled to whatever &s;ituation you may chu&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Happy!"</Q> repeated he, with animation, <Q REND="inline">"Oh I am in Paradi&s;e! I am come from a region in the fir&s;t rude &s;tate of nature, to civilization and refinement! the life I led at the cottage was the life of a &s;avage; no intercour&s;e with &s;ociety, no con&s;olation from books; my mind locked up, every &s;ource dried of intellectual delight, and no enjoy|ment in my power but from &s;leep and from food. Weary of an exi&s;tence which thus levelled me with a brute, I grew a&s;hamed of the approximation, and li&s;tening to the remon&s;trance of my under&s;tanding, I gave up the precipitate plan, to pur&s;ue one more con&s;onant to rea&s;on. I came to town, hired a room, and &s;ent for pen, ink and paper: what I have written are trifles, but the Book&s;eller has not rejected them. I was &s;ettled, therefore, in a moment, and comparing my new occupation with that I had ju&s;t quitted, I &s;eemed exalted on the &s;udden from a mere creature of in&s;tinct, to
<PB N="45" REF="44">
a rational and intelligent being. But when fir&s;t I opened a book, after &s;o long an ab|&s;tinence from all mental nouri&s;hment,&mdash;Oh it was rapture! no half-fami&s;hed beggar regaled &s;uddenly with food, ever &s;eized on his repa&s;t with more hungry avidity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let fortune turn which way it will,"</Q> cried Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"you may defy all its malice, while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;pirit of en|joyment which nothing can &s;ubdue!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But were you not, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"as great an enthu&s;ia&s;t the other day for your cottage, and for labour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was, madam; but there my philo&s;o|phy was erroneous: in my ardour to fly from meanne&s;s and from dependence, I I thought in labour and retirement I &s;hould find freedom and happine&s;s; but I forgot that my body was not &s;ea&s;oned for &s;uch work, and con&s;idered not that a mind which had once been opened by knowledge, could ill endure the contraction of dark and per|petual ignorance. The approach, however, of winter, brought me acquainted with my mi&s;take. It grew cold, it grew bleak; lit|tle guarded again&s;t the inclemency of the weather, I felt its &s;everity in every limb, and mi&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and indulgencies which in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I had never valued. To ri&s;e at break of day, chill, freezing, and com|fortle&s;s! no &s;un abroad, no fire at home!
<PB N="46" REF="45">
to go out in all weather to work, that work rough, coar&s;e and laborious!&mdash;unu&s;ed to &s;uch hard&s;hips, I found I could not bear them, and, however unwillingly, was com|pelled to relinqui&s;h the attempt."</Q></P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t now being over, he again aro&s;e to take leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are going, then, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"immediately to your friends?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he he&s;itating, <Q REND="inline">"not ju&s;t this moment; to-morrow morn|ing perhaps,&mdash;but it is now late, and I have bu&s;ine&s;s for the re&s;t of the day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Mr. Monckton!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"what mi&s;chief have you done by occa|&s;ioning this delay!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This goodne&s;s, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"my &s;i&s;ter can never &s;ufficiently acknow|ledge. But I will own, that though, ju&s;t now, in a warm moment, I felt eager to pre&s;ent my&s;elf to her and my mother, I rather wi&s;h, now I am cooler, to be &s;aved the pain of telling them in per&s;on my &s;itu|ation. I mean, therefore, fir&s;t to write to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will not fail, then, to &s;ee them to-morrow?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly&mdash;I think not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, but certainly you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> not, for I &s;hall call upon them to-day, and a&s;&s;ure them they may expect you. Can I &s;often
<PB N="47" REF="46">
your ta&s;k of writing by giving them any me&s;&s;age from you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam, have a care!"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"this conde&s;cen&s;ion to a poor author may be more dangerous than you have any &s;u&s;|picion! and before you have power to help your&s;elf, you may &s;ee your name prefixed to the Dedication of &s;ome trumpery pam|phlet!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will run,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"all ri&s;ks; remember, therefore, you will be re&s;pon&s;i|ble for the performance of my promi&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will be &s;ure,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"not to forget what reflects &s;o much honour upon my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was &s;atisfied by this a&s;&s;ent, and he then went away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A &s;trange flighty character!"</Q> cried Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"yet of uncommon capacity, and full of genius. Were he le&s;s imagina|tive, wild and eccentric, he has abilities for any &s;tation, and might fix and di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf almo&s;t where-ever he plea&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew not,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the full worth of &s;teadine&s;s and prudence till I knew this young man; for he has every thing el&s;e; talents the mo&s;t &s;triking, a love of virtue the mo&s;t elevated, and manners the mo&s;t plea&s;ing; yet wanting &s;teadine&s;s and prudence, he can neither act with con&s;i&s;t|ency nor pro&s;per with continuance."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">
<Q REND="inline">"He is well enough,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Mar|garet, who had heard the whole argument in &s;ullen taciturnity, <Q REND="inline">"he is well enough, I &s;ay; and there comes no good from young women's being &s;o difficult."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, offended by a &s;peech which im|plied a rude de&s;ire to di&s;po&s;e of her, went up &s;tairs to her own room; and Mr. Monck|ton, always enraged when young men and Cecilia were alluded to in the &s;ame &s;entence, retired to his library.</P>
<P>She then ordered a chair, and went to Portland-Street, to fulfil what &s;he had offered to Belfield, and to revive his mother and &s;i&s;ter by the plea&s;ure of the promi&s;ed interview.</P>
<P>She found them together: and her intel|ligence being of equal con&s;equence to both, &s;he did not now repine at the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Belfield. She made her communica|tion with the mo&s;t cautious attention to their characters, &s;oftening the ill &s;he had to relate with re&s;pect to Belfield's pre&s;ent way of living, by endeavouring to awaken affection and joy from the pro&s;pect of the approach|ing meeting. She coun&s;elled them as much as po&s;&s;ible to re&s;train their chagrin at his misfortunes, which he would but con&s;true into reproach of his ill management; and &s;he repre&s;ented that when once he was re|&s;tored to his family, he might almo&s;t imperceptibly
<PB N="49" REF="48">
be led into &s;ome le&s;s wild and more profitable &s;cheme of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;he had told all &s;he thought proper to relate, kindly inter&s;per&s;ing her account with the be&s;t advice and be&s;t com|fort &s;he could &s;ugge&s;t, &s;he made an end of her vi&s;it; for the affliction of Mrs. Bel|field upon hearing the actual &s;ituation of her &s;on, was &s;o clamorous and unappea&s;e|able, that, little wondering at Belfield's want of courage to encounter it, and having no opportunity in &s;uch a &s;torm to con&s;ole the &s;oft Henrietta, who&s;e tears flowed abund|antly that her brother &s;hould thus be fallen, &s;he only promi&s;ed before &s;he left town to &s;ee her again, and be&s;eeching Mrs. Belfield to moderate her concern, was glad to leave the hou&s;e, where her pre&s;ence had no power to quiet their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day in &s;ad re|flections upon the meeting &s;he was her&s;elf to have the next morning with Mr. Delvile. She wi&s;hed ardently to know whether his &s;on was gone abroad, and whether Mrs. Delvile was recovered, who&s;e health, in her own letter, was mentioned in terms the mo&s;t melancholy: yet neither of the&s;e enquiries could &s;he even think of making, &s;ince rea|&s;onably, without them, apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome reproach.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A WRANGLING.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Monckton, the next day, as &s;oon breakfa&s;t was over, went out, to avoid &s;howing, even to Cecilia, the anxiety he felt concerning the regulation of her for|tune, and arrangement of her affairs. He &s;trongly, however, advi&s;ed her not to men|tion her large debt, which, though con|tracted in the innocence of the pure&s;t be|nevolence, would incur nothing but reproof and di&s;approbation, from all who only heard of it, when they heard of its inutility.</P>
<P>At eleven o'clock, though an hour before the time appointed, while Cecilia was &s;itting in Lady Margaret's dre&s;&s;ing-room, <Q REND="inline">"with &s;ad civility and an aching head,"</Q> &s;he was &s;ummoned to Mr. Briggs in the parlour.</P>
<P>He immediately began reproaching her with having eloped from him, in the &s;um|mer, and with the various expences &s;he had cau&s;ed him from u&s;ele&s;s purcha&s;es and &s;poilt provi&s;ions. He then complained of Mr. Delvile, whom he charged with defrauding him of his dues; but ob&s;erving in the mid&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="50">
of his railing her dejection of countenance, he &s;uddenly broke off, and looking at her with &s;ome concern, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"what's the mat|ter, Ducky? a'n't well? look as if you could not help it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I thank you, Sir, I am very well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What do look &s;o blank for, then?"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"hay? what are fretting for?&mdash;cro&s;&s;ed in love?&mdash;lo&s;t your &s;weet-heart?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, no,"</Q> cried &s;he, with quickne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never mind, my chick, never mind,"</Q> &s;aid he, pinching her cheek, with re&s;umed good humour, <Q REND="inline">"more to be had; if one won't &s;nap, another will; put me in a pa&s;&s;ion by going off from me with that old grandee, or would have got one long ago. Hate that old Don; u&s;ed me very ill; wi&s;h I could trounce him. Thinks more of a fu&s;ty old parchment than the price of &s;tocks. Fit for nothing but to be &s;tuck upon an old monument for a Death's head."</Q></P>
<P>He then told her that her accounts were all made out, and he was ready at any time to produce them; he approved much of her fini&s;hing wholly with the <HI>old Don,</HI> who had been a mere cypher in the executor&s;hip; but he advi&s;ed her not to think of taking her money into her own hands, as he was wil|ling to keep the charge of it him&s;elf till &s;he was married.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="51">
Cecilia, thanking him for the offer, &s;aid &s;he meant now to make her acknowledg|ments for all the trouble he had already taken, but by no means purpo&s;ed to give him any more.</P>
<P>He debated the matter with her warmly, told her &s;he had no chance to &s;ave her&s;elf from knaves and cheats, but by tru&s;ting to nobody but him&s;elf, and informing her what intere&s;t he had already made of her money, enquired how &s;he would &s;et about getting more?</P>
<P>Cecilia, though prejudiced again&s;t him by Mr. Monckton, knew not how to com|bat his arguments; yet con&s;cious that &s;carce any part of the money to which he alluded was in fact her own, &s;he could not yield to them. He was, however, &s;o &s;tubborn and &s;o difficult to deal with, that &s;he at length let him talk without troubling her&s;elf to an&s;wer, and privately determined to beg Mr. Monckton would fight her battle.</P>
<P>She was not, therefore, di&s;plea&s;ed by his interruption, though very much &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ight of his per&s;on, when, in the mid&s;t of Mr. Briggs's oratory, Mr. Hob&s;on entered the parlour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;k pardon, ma'am,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"if I intrude; but I made free to call upon the account of two ladies that are acquaintances

of yours, that are quite, as one may &s;ay, at their wit's ends."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is the matter with them, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, no great matter, but mothers are &s;oon frightened, and when once they are upon the fret, one may as well talk to the boards! they know no more of rea|&s;oning and arguing, than they do of a &s;hop ledger! however, my maxim is this; every body in their way; one has no more right to expect courageou&s;ne&s;s from a lady in them ca&s;es, than one has from a child in arms; for what I &s;ay is, they have not the proper u&s;e of their heads, which makes it very excu&s;able."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, the thing is this; we have been expecting the young 'Squire, as I call him, all the morning, and he has never come; &s;o Mrs. Belfield, not knowing where to &s;end after him, was of opinion he might be here, knowing your kindne&s;s to him, and that."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You make the enquiry at the wrong place, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, much provoked by the implication it conveyed; <Q REND="inline">"if Mr. Belfield is in this hou&s;e, you mu&s;t &s;eek him with Mr. Monckton."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I'll</HI> tell you, Sir,"</Q> cried Mr. Hob&s;on; <Q REND="inline">"it's a very hand&s;ome young gentleman, with as fine a per&s;on, and as genteel a way of behaviour, and withal, as pretty a man|ner of dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, and that, as any lady need de&s;ire.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Has got the ready?"</Q> cried Mr. Briggs, impatiently; <Q REND="inline">"can ca&s;t an account? that's the point; can come down hand&s;omely? eh?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why as to that, Sir, I'm not bound to &s;peak to a gentleman's private affairs. What's my own, is my own, and what is another per&s;on's, is another per&s;on's; that's my way of arguing, and that's what I call talking to the purpo&s;e."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why this is talking quite wide of the mark,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;uppo&s;e a

<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay ay,"</Q> cried Briggs, &s;neeringly, <Q REND="inline">"or whether they &s;tuff their gullets with hot rounds of toa&s;t and butter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what if they do, Sir?"</Q> returned Hob&s;on, a little angrily; <Q REND="inline">"when a man's got above the world, where's the harm of living a little genteel? as to a round of toa&s;t and butter, and a few oy&s;ters, fre&s;h opened, by way of a damper before dinner, no man need be a&s;hamed of them, provided he pays as he goes: and as to living upon water|gruel, and &s;crubbing one's fle&s;h with &s;and, one might as well be a galley-&s;lave at once.

A rap at the &s;treet-door gave now a new relief to Cecilia, who began to grow very apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the delight of &s;pending money, thus warmly conte&s;ted with that of hoarding it, &s;hould give ri&s;e to a quarrel, which, between two &s;uch &s;turdy champions for their own opinions, might lead to a con|clu&s;ion rather more rough and violent than &s;he de&s;ired to witne&s;s: but when the parlour|door opened, in&s;tead of Mr. Delvile, whom &s;he now fully expected, Mr. Albany made his entrance.</P>
<P>This was rather di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as her real bu&s;ine&s;s with her guardians made it proper her conference with them &s;hould be undi&s;|turbed: and Albany was not a man with whom a hint that &s;he was engaged could be ri&s;ked: but &s;he had made no preparation to guard again&s;t interruption, as her little ac|quaintance in London had prevented her expecting any vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>He advanced with a &s;olemn air to Cecilia, and, looking as if hardly determined whe|ther to &s;peak with &s;everity or gentlene&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"once more I come to prove thy &s;in|cerity; now wilt thou go with me where &s;orrow calls thee? &s;orrow thy charity can mitigate?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very much concerned,"</Q> &s;he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"but indeed at pre&s;ent it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">
<Q REND="inline">"Again,"</Q> cried he, with a look at once &s;tern and di&s;appointed, <Q REND="inline">"again thou faile&s;t me? what wanton trifling! why &s;hould&s;t thou thus elate a worn-out mind, only to make it feel its lingering credulity? or why, teaching me to think I had found an angel, &s;o unkindly undeceive me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, much affected by this reproof, <Q REND="inline">"if you knew how heavy a lo&s;s I had per&s;onally &s;uffered&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do know it,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"and I grieved for thee when I heard it. Thou ha&s;t lo&s;t a faithful old friend, a lo&s;s which with every &s;etting &s;un thou may'&s;t mourn, for the ri&s;ing &s;un will never repair it! but was that a rea&s;on for &s;hunning the duties of humanity? was the &s;ight of death a motive for neglecting the claims of benevolence? ought it not rather to have ha&s;tened your fulfilling them? and &s;hould not your own &s;uffering experience of the brevity of life, have taught you the vanity of all things but preparing for its end?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps &s;o, but my grief at that time made me think only of my&s;elf.</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not, I hope, there,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with alacrity, <Q REND="inline">"be backward; but at lea&s;t for this morning I mu&s;t beg to make you my Almoner."</Q></P>
<P>She then took out her pur&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Briggs and Mr. Hob&s;on, who&s;e quarrel had been &s;u&s;pended by the appear|ance of a third per&s;on, and who had &s;tood during this &s;hort dialogue in &s;ilent amaze|ment, having fir&s;t lo&s;t their anger in their mutual con&s;ternation, now lo&s;t their con|&s;ternation in their mutual di&s;plea&s;ure: Mr. Hob&s;on felt offended to hear bu&s;ine&s;s &s;poken of &s;lightly, and Mr. Briggs felt enraged at the &s;ight of Cecilia's ready pur&s;e. Neither of them, however, knew which way to in|terfere, the &s;tern gravity of Albany, joined to a language too lofty for their compre|hen&s;ion, intimidating them both. They took, however, the relief of communing with one another, and Mr. Hob&s;on &s;aid in a whi&s;per <Q REND="inline">"This, you mu&s;t know, is, I am told, a very particular old gentleman; quite what I call a genius. He comes often to my hou&s;e, to &s;ee my lodger Mi&s;s Henny Belfield, though I never happened to light upon him my&s;elf, except once in the pa&s;|&s;age: but what I hear of him is this; he makes a practice, as one may &s;ay, of going about into people's hou&s;es, to do nothing but find fault."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60">
<Q REND="inline">"Shan't get into mine!"</Q> returned Briggs; <Q REND="inline">"promi&s;e him that! don't half like him; be bound he's an old &s;harper."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, mean time, enquired what he de&s;ired to have.</P>
<P>Half a guinea, he an&s;wered.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will that do?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For tho&s;e who have nothing,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"it is much. Hereafter, you may a&s;&s;i&s;t them again. Go but and &s;ee their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and you will wi&s;h to give them every thing."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Briggs now, when actually between her fingers he &s;aw the half guinea, could contain no longer; he twitched the &s;leeve of her gown, and pinching her arm, with a look of painful eagerne&s;s, &s;aid in a whi&s;per <Q REND="inline">"Don't give it! don't let him have it! chou&s;e him, chou&s;e him! nothing but an old bite!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"his character is very well known to me."</Q> And then, di&s;engaging her arm from him, &s;he pre&s;ented her little offering.</P>
<P>At this &s;ight, Mr. Briggs was almo&s;t out|rageous, and lo&s;ing in his wrath, all fear of the &s;tranger, he bur&s;t forth with fury into the following outcries, <Q REND="inline">"Be ruined! &s;ee it plainly; be fleeced! be &s;tript! be robbed! won't have a gown to your back!
<PB N="62" REF="61">
won't have a &s;hoe to your foot! won't have a rag in the world! be a beggar in the &s;treet! come to the pari&s;h! rot in a jail?&mdash;half a guinea at a time!&mdash;enough to break the Great Mogul!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Inhuman &s;pirit of &s;elfi&s;h par&s;imony!"</Q> exclaimed Albany, <Q REND="inline">"repine&s;t thou at this loan, given from thou&s;ands to tho&s;e who have wor&s;e than nothing? who pay to day in hunger for bread they borrowed ye&s;ter|day from pity? who to &s;ave them&s;elves from the deadly pangs of famine, &s;olicit but what the rich know not when they po&s;|&s;e&s;s, and mi&s;s not when they give?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anan!"</Q> cried Briggs; recovering his temper from the perplexity of his under|&s;tanding, at a di&s;cour&s;e to which his ears were wholly unaccu&s;tomed, <Q REND="inline">"what d'ye &s;ay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If to thy&s;elf di&s;tre&s;s may cry in vain,"</Q> continued Albany, <Q REND="inline">"if thy own heart re&s;i&s;ts the &s;uppliant's prayer, callous to entreaty, and hardened in the world, &s;uffer, at lea&s;t, a creature yet untainted, who melts at &s;or|row, and who glows with charity, to pay from her va&s;t wealth a generous tax of thankfulne&s;s, that fate has not rever&s;ed her doom, and tho&s;e whom &s;he relieves, relieve not her!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anan!"</Q> was again all the wondering Mr. Briggs could &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="62">
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if its no offence, was the Gen|tleman ever a player?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fancy not, indeed!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;k pardon, then, ma'am; I mean no harm; but my notion was the gentleman might be &s;peaking &s;omething by heart."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it but on the &s;tage, humanity exi&s;ts?"</Q> cried Albany, indignantly; <Q REND="inline">"Oh thither ha&s;ten, then, ye monopolizers of plenty! ye &s;elfi&s;h, unfeeling engro&s;&s;ers of wealth, which ye di&s;&s;ipate without enjoying, and of abundance, which ye wa&s;te while ye refu&s;e to di&s;tribute! thither, thither ha&s;te, if there humanity exi&s;ts!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to engro&s;&s;ing,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, happy to hear at la&s;t a word with which he was familiar, <Q REND="inline">"it's what I never approved my&s;elf. My maxim is this; if a man makes a fair penny, without any under|hand dealings, why he has as much a title to enjoy his plea&s;ure as the Chief Ju&s;tice, or the Lord Chancellor: and its odds but he's as happy as a greater man. Though what I hold to be be&s;t of all, is a clear con|&s;cience, with a neat income of 2 or 3000 a year. That's my notion; and I don't think it's a bad one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Weak policy of &s;hort-&s;ighted igno|rance!"</Q> cried Albany, <Q REND="inline">"to wi&s;h for what, if u&s;ed, brings care, and if neglected, remor&s;e!
<PB N="64" REF="63">
have you not now beyond what nature craves? why then &s;till &s;igh for more?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why?"</Q> cried Mr Briggs, who by dint of deep attention began now better to com|prehend him, <Q REND="inline">"why to buy in, to be &s;ure! ever hear of &s;tocks, eh? know any thing of money"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Still to make more and more,"</Q> cried Albany, <Q REND="inline">"and wherefore? to &s;pend in vice and idlene&s;s, or hoard in chearle&s;s mi&s;ery! not to give &s;uccour to the wretched, not to &s;up|port the falling; all is for &s;elf, however little wanted, all goes to added &s;tores, or added luxury; no fellow-creature &s;erved, nor even one beggar relieved!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Glad of it!"</Q> cried Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"glad of it; would not have 'em relieved; don't like 'em; hate a beggar; ought to be all whipt; live upon &s;punging."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why as to a beggar, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay,"</Q> cried Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I am by no means an approver of that mode of pro|ceeding; being I take 'em all for cheats: for what I &s;ay is this, what a man earns, he earns, and it's no man's bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire what he &s;pends, for a free-born Engli&s;hman is his own ma&s;ter by the nature of the law, and as to his being a &s;ubject, why a Duke is no more, nor a Judge, nor the Lord High Chancellor, and the like of tho&s;e;
<PB N="65" REF="64">
which makes it tantamount to nothing, being he is an&s;werable to nobody by the right of Magna Charta: except in ca&s;es of trea&s;on, felony, and that. But as to a beg|gar, it's quite another thing; he comes and a&s;ks me for money; but what has he to &s;hew for it? what does he bring me in ex|change? why a long &s;tory that he i'n't worth a penny! what's that to me? nothing at all. Let every man have his own; that's my way of arguing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ungentle mortals!"</Q> cried Albany, <Q REND="inline">"in wealth exulting; even in inhumanity! think you the&s;e wretched outca&s;ts have le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility than your&s;elves? think you, in cold and hunger, they lo&s;e tho&s;e feelings which even in voluptuous pro&s;perity from time to time di&s;turb you? you &s;ay they are all cheats?

<P><Q REND="inline">"Give him a whip!"</Q> cried Briggs, &s;ha'n't have a &s;ou&s;e! &s;end him to Bridewell! nothing but a pauper; hate 'em; hate 'em all! full of tricks; break their own legs, put out their arms, cut off their fingers, &s;nap their own ancles,&mdash;all for what? to get at the chink! to chou&s;e us of ca&s;h!
<PB N="66" REF="65">

<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor &s;ubterfuge of callous cruelty! you cheat your&s;elves, to &s;hun the fraud of others! and yet, how better do you u&s;e the wealth &s;o guarded? what nobler purpo&s;e can it an&s;wer to you, than even a chance to &s;natch &s;ome wretch from &s;inking? think le&s;s how <HI>much</HI> ye &s;ave, and more for <HI>what;</HI> and then con&s;ider how thy full coffers may hereafter make reparation, for the empty catalogue of thy virtues."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anan!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Briggs, again lo&s;t in perplexity and wonder.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh yet,"</Q> continued Albany, turning towards Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"preach not here the hard|ne&s;s which ye practice; rather amend your|&s;elves than corrupt her; and give with liberality what ye ought to receive with gratitude!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is not my doctrine,</Q> "cried Hob|&s;on; <Q REND="inline">"I am not a near man, neither, but as to giving at that rate, it's quite out of character. I have as good a right to my own &s;avings, as to my own gettings; and what I &s;ay is this, who'll give to <HI>me?</HI> let me &s;ee that, and it's quite another thing: and begin who will, I'll be bound to go on with him, pound for pound, or pence for pence. But as to giving to them beggars, it's what I don't approve; I pay the poor's
<PB N="67" REF="66">
rate, and that's what I call charity enough for any man. But for the matter of living well, and &s;pending one's money hand|&s;omely, and having one's comforts about one, why it's a thing of another nature, and I can &s;ay this for my&s;elf, and that is, I never grudged my&s;elf any thing in my life. I always made my&s;elf agreeable, and lived on the be&s;t. That's my way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bad way too,"</Q> cried Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"never get on with it, never &s;ee beyond your no&s;e; won't be worth a plum while your head wags!"</Q> then, taking Cecilia apart, <Q REND="inline">"hark'ee, my duck,"</Q> he added, pointing to Albany, <Q REND="inline">"who is that Mr. Bounce, eh? what is he?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have known him but a &s;hort time, Sir; but I think of him very highly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is he a <HI>good</HI> man? that's the point, is he a <HI>good</HI> man?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed he appears to me uncom|monly benevolent and charitable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But that i'n't the thing; is he <HI>warm?</HI> that's the point, is he <HI>warm?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you mean <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I believe the energy of his manner is merely to enforce what he &s;ays."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't take me, don'ttake me,"</Q> cried he, impatiently; <Q REND="inline">"can come down with the ready, that's the matter; can chink the little gold boys? eh?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">
<Q REND="inline">"Why I rather fear not by his appear|ance; but I know nothing of his affairs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What does come for? eh? come a courting?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mercy on me, no!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What for then? only a &s;punging?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed. He &s;eems to have no wi&s;h but to a&s;&s;i&s;t and plead for others."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All fudge! think he i'n't touched? ay, ay; nothing but a trick! only to get at the chink: &s;ee he's as poor as a rat, talks of nothing but giving money; a bad &s;ign! if he'd got any, would not do it.

<P>A knock at the &s;treet-door gave now a new interruption, and Mr. Delvile at length appeared.</P>
<P>Cecilia, whom his &s;ight could not fail to di&s;concert, felt doubly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the unnece&s;&s;ary pre&s;ence of Albany and Hob|&s;on; &s;he regretted the ab&s;ence of Mr. Monckton, who could ea&s;ily have taken them away; for though without &s;cruple &s;he could her&s;elf have acquainted Mr. Hob&s;on &s;he had bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he dreaded offending Albany, who&s;e e&s;teem &s;he was ambitious of obtaining.</P>

deigned not to make the &s;malle&s;t inclina|tion of his head, nor offered any excu&s;e to Mr. Briggs for being pa&s;t the hour of his appointment: but having advanced a few paces, without looking either to the right or left, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"as I have never acted, my coming may not, perhaps, be e&s;&s;ential; but as my name is in the Dean's Will, and I have once or twice met the other executors mentioned in it, I think it a duty I owe to my own heirs to prevent any po&s;&s;ible future enquiry or trouble to them."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech was directly addre&s;&s;ed to no one, though meant to be attended to by every one, and &s;eemed proudly uttered as a mere apology to him&s;elf for not having declined the meeting.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he recovered from her confu&s;ion by the help of her aver&s;ion to this &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, made not any an&s;wer. Albany retired to a corner of the room; Mr. Hob&s;on began to believe it was time for him to depart; and Mr. Briggs think|ing only of the quarrel in which he had &s;eparated with Mr. Delvile in the &s;ummer, &s;tood &s;welling with venom, which he longed for an opportunity to &s;pit out.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, who regarded this &s;ilence as the effect of his awe-in&s;piring pre&s;ence, became rather more complacent; but ca&s;t|ing his eyes round the room, and perceiving
<PB N="70" REF="69">
the two &s;trangers, he was vi&s;ibly &s;urpri&s;ed, and looking at Cecilia for &s;ome explanation, &s;eemed to &s;tand &s;u&s;pended from the purpo&s;e of his vi&s;it till he heard one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></P>
<P>Cecilia, earnet to have the bu&s;ine&s;s con|cluded, turned to Mr. Briggs, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, here is pen and ink <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> to write, or am I? or what is to be done?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a &s;neer, <Q REND="inline">"give it t'other; all in our turn; don't come before his Grace the Right Honourable Mr. Vampus."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Before whom, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, reddening.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Before my Lord Don Pedigree,"</Q> an|&s;wered Briggs, with a &s;piteful grin, <Q REND="inline">"know him? eh? ever hear of &s;uch a per&s;on?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Delvile coloured &s;till deeper, but turning contemptuou&s;ly from him, di&s;dained making any reply.</P>
<P>Mr. Briggs, who now regarded him as a defeated man, &s;aid exultingly to Mr. Hob|&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"what do &s;tand here for?&mdash;hay?&mdash;fall o' your marrowbones; don't &s;ee 'Squire High and Mighty?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to falling on my marrowbones,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"it's what I &s;hall do to no man, except he was the King him&s;elf, or the like of that, and going to make me Chancellor of the Exchequer, or Commi&s;&s;ioner of Exci&s;e. Not that I mean
<PB N="71" REF="70">
the gentleman any offence; but a man's a man, and for one man to wor&s;hip another is quite out of law."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t, mu&s;t!"</Q> cried Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"tell all his old grand-dads el&s;e: keeps 'em in a roll; locks 'em in a clo&s;et; &s;ays his prayers to 'em; can't live without 'em: likes 'em better than ca&s;h!&mdash;wi&s;h had 'em here! pop 'em all in the &s;ink!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If your intention, Sir,"</Q> cried Mr Delvile, fiercely, <Q REND="inline">"is only to in&s;ult me, I am prepared for what mea&s;ures I &s;hall take. I declined &s;eeing you in my own hou&s;e, that I might not be under the &s;ame re&s;traint as when it was my unfortunate lot to meet you la&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who cares?"</Q> cried Briggs, with an air of defiance, <Q REND="inline">"what can do, eh? poke me into a family vault? bind me o' top of an old monument? tie me to a &s;tinking car|ca&s;e? make a corp&s;e of me, and call it one of your famous cou&s;ins?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For heaven's &s;ake, Mr. Briggs,"</Q> in|terrupted Cecilia, who &s;aw that Mr. Delvile, trembling with pa&s;&s;ion, &s;carce refrained lift|ing up his &s;tick, <Q REND="inline">"be appea&s;ed, and let us fini&s;h our bu&s;ine&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P>"Albany now, hearing in Cecilia's voice the alarm with which &s;he was &s;eized, came forward and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"whence this un|meaning di&s;&s;ention? to what purpo&s;e this
<PB N="72" REF="71">
irritating abu&s;e? Oh vain and fooli&s;h! live ye &s;o happily, la&s;t ye &s;o long, that time and peace may thus be trifled with?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There, there!"</Q> cried Briggs, holding up his finger at Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"have it now! got old Mr. Bounce upon you! give you enough of it; promi&s;e you that!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Re&s;train,"</Q> continued Albany, <Q REND="inline">"this idle wrath; and if ye have ardent pa&s;&s;ions, employ them to nobler u&s;es; let them &s;timulate acts of virtue, let them animate deeds of beneficence! Oh wa&s;te not &s;pirits that may urge you to good, lead you to honour, warm you to charity, in poor and angry words, in unfriendly, unmanly de|bate!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, who from the approach of Albany, had given him his whole attention, was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at this ad|dre&s;s, and almo&s;t petrified with wonder at his language and exhortations.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I mu&s;t own,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"as to this matter I am much of the &s;ame mind my&s;elf; for quarreling's a thing I don't uphold; being it advances one no way; for what I &s;ay is this, if a man gets the better, he's only where he was before, and if he gets wor&s;ted, why it's odds but the laugh's again&s;t him: &s;o, if I may make bold to give my verdict, I would have one of the&s;e gentlemen take the other by the
<PB N="73" REF="72">
hand, and &s;o put an end to bad words. That's my maxim, and that's what I call being agreeable."</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Delvile, at the words <HI>one of the&s;e gentlemen take the other by the hand,</HI> looked &s;cornfully upon Mr. Hob&s;on, with a frown that expre&s;&s;ed his highe&s;t indignation, at being thus familiarly coupled with Mr. Briggs. And then, turning from him to Cecilia, haughtily &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e two per&s;ons,"</Q> pointing towards Albany and Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"waiting here to be witne&s;&s;es to any tran&s;action?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</Q> cried Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I don't mean to intrude, I am going directly. So you can give me no in&s;ight, ma'am,"</Q> ad|dre&s;&s;ing Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"as to where I might light upon Mr. Belfield?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me? no!"</Q> cried &s;he, much provoked by ob&s;erving that Mr. Delvile &s;uddenly looked at her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, ma'am, well, I mean no harm: only I hold it that the right way to hear of a young gentleman, is to a&s;k for him of a young lady: that's my maxim. Come, Sir,"</Q> to Mr. Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"you and I had like to have fallen out, but what I &s;ay is this; let no man bear malice; that's my way: &s;o I hope we part without ill blood?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay;"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Briggs, giving him a nod.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="73">
<Q REND="inline">"Well, then,"</Q> added Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I hope the good-will may go round, and that not only you and I, but the&s;e two good old gentlemen will al&s;o lend a hand."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Delvile now was at a lo&s;s which way to turn for very rage; but after looking at every one with a face flaming with ire, he &s;aid to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"If you have collected to|gether the&s;e per&s;ons for the purpo&s;e of af|fronting me, I mu&s;t beg you to remember I am not one to be affronted with impu|nity!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, half frightened, was beginning an an&s;wer that di&s;claimed any &s;uch inten|tion, when Albany, with the mo&s;t indig|nant energy, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh pride of heart, with littlene&s;s of &s;oul! check this vile arrogance, too vain for man, and &s;pare to others &s;ome part of that lenity thou nou|ri&s;he&s;t for thy&s;elf, or ju&s;tly be&s;tow on thy|&s;elf that contempt thou nouri&s;he&s;t for others!"</Q></P>
<P>And with the&s;e words he &s;ternly left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The thunder&s;truck Mr. Delvile began now to fancy that all the demons of tor|ment were de&s;ignedly let loo&s;e upon him, and his &s;urpri&s;e and re&s;entment operated &s;o powerfully that it was only in broken &s;entences he could expre&s;s either. <Q REND="inline">"Very extraordinary!&mdash;a new method of conduct!
<PB N="75" REF="74">
&mdash;liberties to which I am not much u&s;ed!&mdash;impertinences I &s;hall not ha&s;tily forget,&mdash;treatment that would &s;carce be pardon|able to a per&s;on wholly unknown!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I can't but &s;ay it was rather a cut up; but the old gentleman is what one may call a genius, which makes it a little excu&s;able; for he does things all his own way, and I am told it's the &s;ame thing who he &s;peaks to, &s;o he can but find fault, and that."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> interrupted the &s;till more highly offended Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"what <HI>you</HI> may be told is extremely immaterial to <HI>me;</HI> and I mu&s;t take the liberty to hint to you, a con|ver&s;ation of this ea&s;y kind is not what I am much in practice in hearing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, I a&s;k pardon,"</Q> &s;aid Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I meant nothing but what was agreeable, however, I have done, and I wi&s;h you good day. Your humble &s;ervant, ma'am, and I hope, Sir,"</Q> to Mr. Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"you won't begin bad words again?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"ready to make up; all at end; only don't much like <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> that's all!"</Q> winking &s;ignificantly, <Q REND="inline">"not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> over fond of a <HI>&s;keleton!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hob&s;on now retired; and Mr. Del|ville and Mr. Briggs, being both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, in ha&s;te to have done, &s;ettled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> five minutes all for which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="76" REF="75">
after pa&s;&s;ing more than an hour in agreeing what that was.</P>
<P>Mr. Briggs then, &s;aying he had an en|gagement upon bu&s;ine&s;s, declined &s;ettling his own accounts till another time, but promi&s;ed to &s;ee Cecilia again &s;oon, and added, <Q REND="inline">"be &s;ure take care of that old Mr. Bounce! cracked in the noddle; &s;ee that with half an eye! better not tru&s;t him! break out &s;ome day: do you a mi&s;chief!"</Q></P>
<P>He then went away: but while the par|lour-door was &s;till open, to the no little &s;urpri&s;e of Cecilia, the &s;ervant announced Mr. Belfield. He hardly entered the room, and his countenance &s;poke ha&s;te and eager|ne&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"I have this moment, madam,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"been informed a complaint has been lodged again&s;t me here, and I could not re&s;t till I had the honour of a&s;&s;uring you, that though I have been rather dilatory, I have not neglected my appointment, nor has the conde&s;cen&s;ion of your interference been thrown away."</Q></P>
<P>He then bowed, &s;hut the door, and ran off. Cecilia, though happy to under&s;tand by this &s;peech that he was actually re&s;tored to his family, was &s;orry at the&s;e repeated intru&s;ions in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Delvile, who was now the only one that remained.</P>
<P>She expected every in&s;tant that he would ring for his chair, which he kept in waiting;
<PB N="77" REF="76">
but, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome continaunce, to her equal &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;turbance, he made the following &s;peech. <Q REND="inline">"As it is probable I am now for the la&s;t time alone with you, ma'am, and as it is certain we &s;hall meet no more upon bu&s;ine&s;s, I cannot, in ju&s;tice to my own character, and to the re&s;pect I retain for the memory of the Dean, your uncle, take a final leave of the office with which he was plea&s;ed to inve&s;t me, without fir&s;t fulfilling my own ideas of the duty it requires from me, by giving you &s;ome coun&s;el relating to your future e&s;ta|bli&s;hment."</Q></P>
<P>This was not a preface much to enliven Cecilia; it prepared her for &s;uch &s;peeches as &s;he was lea&s;t willing to hear, and gave to her the mixt and painful &s;en&s;ation of &s;pirits depre&s;&s;ed, with pride alarmed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My numerous engagements,"</Q> he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"and the appropriation of my time, already &s;ettled, to their various claims, mu&s;t make me brief in what I have to re|pre&s;ent, and &s;omewhat, perhaps, abrupt in coming to the purpo&s;e. But that you will excu&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia di&s;dained to humour this arro|gance by any compliments or conce&s;&s;ions: &s;he was &s;ilent, therefore; and when they were both &s;eated, he went on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are now at a time of life when it
<PB N="78" REF="77">
is natural for young women to wi&s;n for &s;ome connection: and the largene&s;s of your for|tune will remove from you &s;uch difficulties as prove bars to the preten&s;ions, in this ex|pen&s;ive age, of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s not &s;uch advantages. It would have been &s;ome plea|&s;ure to me, while I yet con&s;idered you as my Ward, to have &s;een you properly di&s;|po&s;ed of: but as that time is pa&s;t, I can only give you &s;ome general advice, which you may follow or neglect as you think fit. By giving it, I &s;hall &s;atisfy my&s;elf; for the re&s;t, I am not re&s;pon&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed; but Cecilia felt le&s;s and le&s;s inclination to make u&s;e of the opportunity by &s;peaking in her turn.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet though, as I ju&s;t now hinted, young women of large fortunes may have little trouble in finding them&s;elves e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, they ought not, therefore, to trifle when proper ones are in their power, nor to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves equal to any they may chance to de&s;ire,"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia coloured high at this pointed re|prehen&s;ion; but feeling her di&s;gu&s;t every moment encrea&s;e, determined to &s;u&s;tain her|&s;elf with dignity, and at lea&s;t not &s;uffer him to perceive the triumph of his o&s;tentation and rudene&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The propo&s;als,"</Q> he continued <Q REND="inline">"of the Earl of Ernolf had always my approbation;
<PB N="79" REF="78">
it was certainly an ill-judged thing to neglect &s;uch an opportunity of being honourably &s;ettled. The clau&s;e of the name was, to <HI>him,</HI> immaterial; &s;ince his own name half a century ago was unheard of, and &s;ince he is him&s;elf only known by his title. He is &s;till, however, I have au|thority to acquaint you, perfectly well di&s;|po&s;ed to renew his application to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia coldly, <Q REND="inline">"to hear it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have, perhaps, &s;ome other better offer in view?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, with &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"nor even in de&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Am I, then, to infer that &s;ome infe|rior offer has more chance of your appro|bation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no rea&s;on, Sir, to infer any thing; I am content with my actual &s;itua|tion, and have, at pre&s;ent, neither pro&s;pect nor intention of changing it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I perceive, but without &s;urpri&s;e, your unwillingne&s;s to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject; nor do I mean to pre&s;s it: I &s;hall merely offer to your con&s;ideration one caution, and then relieve you from my pre&s;ence. Young women of ample fortunes, who are early independent, are &s;ometimes apt to pre&s;ume they may do every thing with impunity; but they are mi&s;taken; they are as liable to
<PB N="80" REF="79">
cen&s;ure as tho&s;e who are wholly unprovided for."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;taring, <Q REND="inline">"this at lea&s;t is a caution rather drawn from my &s;ituation than my behaviour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mean not, ma'am, narrowly to go into, or inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject; what I have &s;aid you may make your own u&s;e of; I have only to ob&s;erve further, that when young women, at your time of life, are at all negligent of &s;o nice a thing as reputa|tion, they commonly live to repent it."</Q></P>
<P>He then aro&s;e to go, but Cecilia, not more offended than amazed, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t beg, Sir, you will explain your&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly this matter,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t be immaterial to <HI>me:</HI> yet, as I have once been your guardian by the nomination of the Dean your uncle, I cannot forbear making an effort towards preventing any indi&s;cretion: and frequent vi&s;its to a young man&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God! Sir,"</Q> interrupted Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"what is it you mean?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It can certainly, as I &s;aid before, be nothing to <HI>me,</HI> though I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you in better hands: but I cannot &s;up|po&s;e you have been led to take &s;uch &s;teps without &s;ome &s;erious plan; and I would advi&s;e you, without lo&s;s of time, to think better of what you are about."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">
<Q REND="inline">"Should I think, Sir, to eternity,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I could never conjecture what you mean!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may not chu&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid he, proudly, <Q REND="inline">"to under&s;tand me; but I have done. If it had been in my power to have interfered in your &s;ervice with my Lord Derford, not|with&s;tanding my reluctance to being in|volved in any fre&s;h employment, I &s;hould have made a point of not refu&s;ing it: but this young man is nobody,&mdash;a very impru|dent connection&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What young man, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, <HI>I</HI> know nothing of him! it is by no means likely I &s;hould: but as I had already been informed of your attention to him, the corroborating incidents of my &s;ervant's following you to his hou&s;e, his friend's &s;eeking him at yours, and his own waiting upon you this morning; were not well calculated to make me withdraw my credence to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it, then, Mr. Belfield, Sir, con|cerning whom you draw the&s;e inferences, from circum&s;tances the mo&s;t accidental and unmeaning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is by no means my practice,"</Q> cried he, haughtily, and with evident marks of high di&s;plea&s;ure at this &s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"to believe any thing lightly, or without even unque&s;|tionable authority; what once, therefore, I
<PB N="82" REF="81">
have credited, I do not often find erro+neous. Mi&s;take not, however, what I have &s;aid into &s;uppo&s;ing I have any objection to your marrying; on the contrary, it had been for the honour of my family had you been married a year ago: I &s;hould not then have &s;uffered the degradation of &s;eeing a &s;on of the fir&s;t expectations in the kingdom upon the point of renouncing his birth, nor a woman of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction ruined in her health, and broken for ever in her con&s;titution."</Q></P>
<P>The emotions of Cecilia at this &s;peech were too powerful for concealment; her colour varied, now reddening with indigna|tion, now turning pale with apprehen&s;ion; &s;he aro&s;e, &s;he trembled and &s;at down, &s;he aro&s;e again, but not knowing what to &s;ay or what to do, again &s;at down.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile then, making a &s;tiff bow, wi&s;hed her good morning.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Go not &s;o, Sir!"</Q> cried &s;he, in falter|ing accents; <Q REND="inline">"let me at lea&s;t convince you of the mi&s;take with regard to Mr. Belfield&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My mi&s;takes, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a contemptuous &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"are perhaps not ea&s;ily convicted: and I may po&s;&s;ibly labour under others that would give you no le&s;s trouble: it may therefore be better to avoid any further di&s;qui&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not better,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, again
<PB N="83" REF="82">
recovering her courage from this fre&s;h pro|vocation; <Q REND="inline">"I fear no di&s;qui&s;ition; on the contrary, it is my intere&s;t to &s;olicit one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This intrepidity in a young woman,"</Q> &s;aid he, ironically, <Q REND="inline">"is certainly very com|mendable; and doubtle&s;s, as you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s, your having run out great part of your fortune, is nothing beyond what you have a right to do."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me!"</Q> cried Cecilia, a&s;toni&s;hed, <Q REND="inline">"run out great part of my fortune!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps that is another <HI>mi&s;take!</HI> I have not often been &s;o unfortunate; and you are not, then, in debt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In debt, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, I have no intention to enquire into your affairs. Good morning to you, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg, I entreat, Sir, that you will &s;top!&mdash;make me, at lea&s;t, under&s;tand what you mean, whether you deign to hear my ju&s;tification or not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I am mi&s;taken, it &s;eems! mi&s;in|formed, deceived; and you have neither &s;pent more than you have received, nor taken up money of Jews? your minority has been clear of debts? and your fortune, now you are of age, will be free from in|combrances?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who now began to under&s;tand
<PB N="84" REF="83">
him, eagerly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"do you mean, Sir, the money which I took up la&s;t &s;pring?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no; by no means, I conceive the whole to be a <HI>mi&s;take!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>And he went to the door.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hear me but a moment, Sir!"</Q> cried &s;he ha&s;tily, following him; <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you know of that tran&s;action, do not refu&s;e to li&s;ten to its occa&s;ion; I took up the money for Mr. Harrel; it was all, and &s;olely for him."</Q></P>

<P>And he opened the door.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will not hear me, then? you will not credit me?"</Q> cried &s;he in the cruelle&s;t agitation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Some other time, ma'am; at pre&s;ent my avocations are too numerous to permit me."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A SUSPICION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA was now left in a &s;tate of perturbation that was hardly to be in|dured. The contempt with which &s;he had been treated during the whole vi&s;it was nothing &s;hort of in&s;ult, but the accu&s;ations with which it was concluded did not more irritate than a&s;toni&s;h her.</P>
<P>That &s;ome &s;trange prejudice had been taken again&s;t her, even more than belonged to her connection with young Delvile, the me&s;&s;age brought her by Dr. Ly&s;ter had given her rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e: what that pre|judice was &s;he now knew, though how ex|cited &s;he was &s;till ignorant; but &s;he found Mr. Delvile had been informed &s;he had taken up money of a Jew, without having heard it was for Mr. Harrel, and that he had been acquainted with her vi&s;its in Portland|Street, without &s;eeming to know Mr. Bel|field had a &s;i&s;ter. Two charges &s;uch as the&s;e, &s;o &s;erious in their nature, and &s;o di&s;|tructive of her character, filled her with horror and con&s;ternation, and even &s;omewhat
<PB N="86" REF="85">
&s;erved to palliate his illiberal and in|jurious behaviour.</P>
<P>But how reports thus fal&s;e and thus di&s;|graceful &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and by what dark work of &s;lander and malignity they had been &s;pread, remained a doubt inexplica|ble. They could not, &s;he was certain, be the mere rumour of chance, &s;ince in both the a&s;&s;ertions there was &s;ome foundation of truth, however cruelly perverted, or ba&s;ely over-charged.</P>
<P>This led her to con&s;ider how few people there were not only who had intere&s;t, but who had power to propagate &s;uch calum|nies; even her acquaintance with the Bel|field's &s;he remembered not ever mention|ing, for &s;he knew none of their friends, and none of her own knew them. How, then, &s;hould it be circulated, that &s;he <Q REND="inline">"vi&s;ited often at the hou&s;e?"</Q> how ever be invented that it was from her <Q REND="inline">"attention to the young man?"</Q> Henrietta, &s;he was &s;ure, was too good and too innocent to be guilty of &s;uch perfidy; and the young man him|&s;elf had always &s;hewn a mode&s;ty and pro|priety that manife&s;ted his total freedom from the vanity of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, and an ele|vation of &s;entiment that would have taught him to &s;corn the boa&s;t, even if he believed the partiality.</P>
<P>The mother, however, had neither been
<PB N="87" REF="86">
&s;o mode&s;t nor &s;o rational; &s;he had openly avowed her opinion that Cecilia was in love with her &s;on; and as that &s;on, by never offering him&s;elf, had never been refu&s;ed, her opinion had received no check of &s;uf|ficient force, for a mind &s;o gro&s;s and literal, to change it.</P>
<P>This part, therefore, of the charge &s;he gave to Mrs. Belfield, who&s;e officious and loquacious forwardne&s;s &s;he concluded had induced her to narrate her &s;u&s;picions, till, &s;tep by &s;tep, they had reached Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P>But though able, by the probability of this conjecture, to account for the report concerning Belfield, the whole affair of the debt remained a difficulty not to be &s;olved. Mr. Harrel, his wife, Mr. Arnott, the Jew and Mr. Monckton, were the only per&s;ons to whom the tran&s;action was known; and though from five, a &s;ecret, in the cour&s;e of &s;o many months, might ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed likely to tran&s;pire, tho&s;e five were &s;o parti|cularly bound to &s;ilence, not only for her intere&s;t but their own, that it was not un|rea&s;onable to believe it as &s;afe among them all, as if &s;olely con&s;igned to one. For her|&s;elf, &s;he had revealed it to no creature but Mr. Monckton; not even to Delvile; though, upon her con&s;enting to marry him, he had an undoubted right to be acquainted with the true &s;tate of her affairs; but &s;uch
<PB N="88" REF="87">
had been the hurry, di&s;tre&s;s, confu&s;ion and irre&s;olution of her mind at that period, that this whole circum&s;tance had been driven from it entirely, and &s;he had, &s;ince, frequently blamed her&s;elf for &s;uch want of recollection. Mr. Harrel, for a thou&s;and rea&s;ons, &s;he was certain had never named it; and had the communication come from his widow or from Mr. Arnott, the motives would have been related as well as the debt, and &s;he had been &s;pared the reproach of contracting it for purpo&s;es of her own extravagance. The Jew, indeed, was, to her, under no obligation of &s;ecrecy, but he had an obligation far more binding,&mdash;he was tied to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A &s;u&s;picion now aro&s;e in her mind which made it thrill with horror; <Q REND="inline">good God!</Q> &s;he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">can Mr. Monckton&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;topt, even to her&s;elf;&mdash;&s;he checked the idea;&mdash;&s;he drove it ha&s;tily from her;&mdash;&s;he was certain it was fal&s;e and cruel;&mdash;&s;he hated her&s;elf for having &s;tarted it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, cried &s;he, he is my friend, the confirmed friend of many years, my well|wi&s;her from childhood, my zealous coun|&s;ellor and a&s;&s;i&s;tant almo&s;t from my birth to this hour:&mdash;&s;uch perfidy from him would not even be human!"</Q></P>
<P>Yet &s;till her perplexity was undimini&s;hed; the affair was undoubtedly known, and it
<PB N="89" REF="88">
only could be known by the treachery of &s;ome one entru&s;ted with it: and however ear|ne&s;tly her genero&s;ity combated her ri&s;ing &s;u&s;picions, &s;he could not wholly quell them; and Mr. Monckton's &s;trange aver&s;ion to the Delviles, his earne&s;tne&s;s to break off her connexion with them, occurred to her remembrance, and haunted her perforce with &s;urmi&s;es to his di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>That gentleman, when he came home, found her in this comfortle&s;s and fluctuating &s;tate, endeavouring to form conjectures upon what had happened, yet unable to &s;ucceed, but by &s;ugge&s;tions which one moment ex|cited her abhorrence of him, and the next of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>He enquired, with his u&s;ual appearance of ea&s;y friendline&s;s, into what had pa&s;&s;ed with her two guardians, and how &s;he had &s;ettled her affairs. She an&s;wered without he&s;itation all his que&s;tions, but her manner was cold and re&s;erved, though her com|munication was frank.</P>
<P>This was not unheeded by Mr. Monck|ton, who, after a &s;hort time, begged to know if any thing had di&s;turbed her.</P>
<P>Cecilia a&s;hamed of her doubts, though unable to get rid of them, then endeavoured to brighten up, and changed the &s;ubject to the difficulties &s;he had had to encounter from the ob&s;tinacy of Mr. Briggs.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="89">
Mr. Monckton for a while humoured this eva&s;ion; but when, by her own exer|tion, her &s;olemnity began to wear off, he repeated his interrogatory, and would not be &s;atisfied without an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Cecilia, earne&s;t that &s;urmi&s;es &s;o inju|rious &s;hould be removed, then hone&s;tly, but without comments, related the &s;cene which had ju&s;t pa&s;t between Mr. Delvile and her&s;elf.</P>
<P>No comments were, however, wanting to explain to Mr. Monckton the change of her behaviour: <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee,"</Q> he cried ha&s;tily, <Q REND="inline">"what you cannot but &s;u&s;pect; and I will go my&s;elf to Mr. Delvile, and in&s;i&s;t upon his clearing me."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;hocked to have thus betrayed what was pa&s;&s;ing within her, a&s;&s;ured him his vindication required not &s;uch a &s;tep, and begged he would coun&s;el her how to di&s;cover this treachery, without drawing from her concern at it a conclu&s;ion &s;o of|fen&s;ive to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was evidently, however, and greatly di&s;turbed; he declared his own wonder equal to her's how the affair had been be|trayed, expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t indignation at the malevolent in&s;inuations again&s;t her conduct, and lamented with mingled acri|mony and grief, that there &s;hould exi&s;t even
<PB N="91" REF="90">
the po&s;&s;ibility of ca&s;ting the odium of &s;uch villainy upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Cecilia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, perplexed, and a&s;hamed at once, again endeavoured to appea&s;e him, and though a lurking doubt ob&s;tinately clung to her under&s;tanding, the purity of her own principles, and the &s;oftne&s;s of her heart, pleaded &s;trongly for his innocence, and urged her to dete&s;t her &s;u&s;picion, though to conquer it they were unequal.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is true,"</Q> &s;aid he, with an air inge|nuous though mortified, <Q REND="inline">"I di&s;like the Delvile's, and have always di&s;liked them; they appear to me a jealous, vindictive, and in&s;olent race, and I &s;hould have thought I betrayed the faithful regard I profe&s;&s;ed for you, had I concealed my opinion when I &s;aw you in danger of forming an alliance with them; I &s;poke to you, therefore, with hone&s;t zeal, thoughtle&s;s of any enmity I might draw upon my&s;elf; but though it was an interference from which I hoped, by preventing the connection, to contribute to your happine&s;s, it was not with a de&s;ign to &s;top it at the expence of your character,&mdash;a de&s;ign black, horrible and diabolical! a de&s;ign which mu&s;t be formed by a Daemon, but which even a Daemon could never, I think, execute!"</Q></P>
<P>The candour of this &s;peech, in which his aver&s;ion to the Delvile's was openly acknowledged,
<PB N="92" REF="91">
and rationally ju&s;tified, &s;omewhat quieted the &s;u&s;picions of Cecilia, which far more anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to be confuted than confirmed: &s;he began, therefore, to con|clude that &s;ome accident, inexplicable as unfortunate, had occa&s;ioned the partial di&s;|covery to Mr. Delvile, by which her own goodne&s;s proved the &s;ource of her defama|tion: and though &s;omething &s;till hung upon her mind that de&s;troyed that firm con|fidence &s;he had hitherto felt in the friend|&s;hip of Mr. Monckton, &s;he held it utterly unju&s;t to condemn him without proof, which &s;he was not more unable to procure, than to &s;atisfy her&s;elf with any rea&s;on why &s;o perfidiou&s;ly he &s;hould calumniate her.</P>
<P>Comfortle&s;s, however, and tormented with conjectures equally vague and afflicting, &s;he could only clear him to be lo&s;t in perplexity, &s;he could only accu&s;e him to be penetrated with horror. She endeavoured to &s;u&s;|pend her judgment till time &s;hould deve|lop the my&s;tery, and only for the pre&s;ent &s;ought to fini&s;h her bu&s;ine&s;s and leave London.</P>
<P>She renewed, therefore, again, the &s;ub|ject of Mr. Briggs, and told him how vain had been her effort to &s;ettle with him. Mr. Monckton in&s;tantly offered his &s;ervices in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her, and the next morning they went together to his hou&s;e, where, after an
<PB N="93" REF="92">
ob&s;tinate battle, they gained a complete vic|tory: Mr. Briggs gave up all his accounts, and, in a few days, by the active interfe|rence of Mr. Monckton, her affairs were wholly taken out of his hands. He &s;tormed, and prophe&s;ied all ill to Cecilia, but it was not to any purpo&s;e; he was &s;o di&s;agreeable to her, by his manners, and &s;o unintelligi|ble to her in matters of bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;he was happy to have done with him; even though, upon in&s;pecting his accounts, they were all found clear and exact, and his de&s;ire to retain his power over her fortune, proved to have no other motive than a love of money &s;o potent, that to manage it, even for another, gave him a &s;atisfaction he knew not how to relinqui&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who, though a man of plea&s;ure, under&s;tood bu&s;ine&s;s perfectly well, now in&s;tructed and directed her in making a general arrangement of her affairs. The e&s;tate which devolved to her from her uncle, and which was all in landed property, &s;he con|tinued to commit to the management of the &s;teward who was employed in his life-time; and her own fortune from her father, which was all in the &s;tocks, &s;he now dimini&s;hed to nothing by &s;elling out to pay Mr. Monck|ton the principal and intere&s;t which &s;he owed him, and by &s;ettling with her Book|&s;eller.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93">
While the&s;e matters were tran&s;acting, which, notwith&s;tanding her eagerne&s;s to leave town, could not be brought into &s;uch a train as to permit her ab&s;ence in le&s;s than a week, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her time chiefly alone. Her wi&s;hes all inclined her to be&s;tow it upon Henrietta, but the late attack of Mr. Delvile had frightened her from keeping up that connection, &s;ince however carefully &s;he might confine it to the daughter, Mrs. Belfield, &s;he was certain, would impute it all to the &s;on,</P>
<P>That attack re&s;ted upon her mind, in de|fiance of all her endeavours to bani&s;h it; the contempt with which it was made &s;eemed intentionally offen&s;ive, as if he had been happy to derive from her &s;uppo&s;ed ill con|duct, a right to triumph over as well as reject her. She concluded, al&s;o, that Del|vile would be informed of the&s;e calumnies, yet &s;he judged his genero&s;ity by her own, and was therefore convinced he would not credit them: but what chiefly at this time encrea&s;ed her &s;adne&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s, was the mention of Mrs. Delvile's broken con|&s;titution and ruined health. She had always pre&s;erved for that lady the mo&s;t affectionate re&s;pect, and could not con&s;ider her&s;elf as the cau&s;e of her &s;ufferings, without feeling the utmo&s;t concern, however con&s;cious &s;he had not wilfully occa&s;ioned them.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="94">
Nor was this &s;cene the only one by which her efforts to forget this family were de|feated; her watchful monitor, Albany, failed not again to claim her promi&s;e; and though Mr. Monckton earne&s;tly exhorted her not to tru&s;t her&s;elf out with him, &s;he preferred a little ri&s;k to the keenne&s;s of his reproaches, and the weather being good on the morning that he called, &s;he con&s;ented to accompany him in his rambles: only charging her footman to follow where-ever they went, and not to fail enquiring for her if &s;he &s;tayed long out of his &s;ight. The&s;e precautions were rather taken to &s;atisfy Mr. Monckton than her&s;elf, who, having now procured intelligence of the former di&s;order of his intellects, was fearful of &s;ome ex|travagance, and apprehen&s;ive for her &s;afety.</P>
<P>He took her to a mi&s;erable hou&s;e in a court leading into Piccadilly, where, up three pair of &s;tairs, was a wretched woman ill in bed, while a large family of children were playing in the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"See here,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"what human nature can endure! look at that poor wretch, di&s;tracted with torture, yet lying in all this noi&s;e! unable to &s;tir in her bed, yet with|out any a&s;&s;i&s;tant! &s;uffering the pangs of acute di&s;ea&s;e, yet wanting the nece&s;&s;aries of life!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia went up to the bed-&s;ide, and enquired
<PB N="96" REF="95">
more particularly into the &s;ituation of the invalid; but finding &s;he could hardly &s;peak from pain, &s;he &s;ent for the woman of the hou&s;e, who kept a Green Grocer's &s;hop on the ground floor, and de&s;ired her to hire a nur&s;e for her &s;ick lodger, to call all the children down &s;tairs, and to &s;end for an apothecary, who&s;e bill &s;he promi&s;ed to pay. She then gave her &s;ome money to get what nece&s;&s;aries might be wanted, and &s;aid &s;he would come again in two days to &s;ee how they went on.</P>
<P>Albany, who li&s;tened to the&s;e directions with &s;ilent, yet eager attention, now cla&s;ped both his hands with a look of rapture, and exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Virtue yet lives,&mdash;and I have found her?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, proud of &s;uch prai&s;e, and ambi|tious to de&s;erve it, chearfully &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"where, Sir, &s;hall we go now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Home;"</Q> an&s;wered he with an a&s;pect the mo&s;t benign; <Q REND="inline">"I will not wear out thy pity by rendering woe familiar to it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though at this moment more di&s;|po&s;ed for acts of charity than for bu&s;ine&s;s or for plea&s;ure, remembered that her for|tune however large was not unlimited, and would not pre&s;s any further bounty for ob|jects &s;he knew not, certain that occa&s;ions and claimants, far beyond her ability of an|&s;wering, would but too frequently ari&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="96">
among tho&s;e with whom &s;he was more con|nected, &s;he therefore yielded her&s;elf to his direction, and returned to Soho-Square.</P>
<P>Again, however, he failed not to call at the time &s;he had appointed for re-vi&s;iting the invalid, to whom, with much glad|ne&s;s, he conducted her.</P>
<P>The poor woman, who&s;e di&s;ea&s;e was a rheumatic fever, was already much better; &s;he had been attended by an apothecary who had given her &s;ome alleviating medi|cine; &s;he had a nur&s;e at her bed-&s;ide, and the room being cleared of the children, &s;he had had the refre&s;hment of &s;ome &s;leep.</P>
<P>She was now able to rai&s;e her head, and make her acknowledgments to her bene|factre&s;s; but not a little was the &s;urpri&s;e of Cecilia, when, upon looking in her face, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam, I have &s;een you before!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cecilia, who had not the &s;malle&s;t re|collection of her, in return de&s;ired to know when, or where?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When you were going to be married, madam, I was the Pew-Opener at &mdash; Church."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;tarted with &s;ecret horror, and in|voluntarily retreated from the bed; while Albany with a look of a&s;toni&s;hment ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"Married!&mdash;why, then, is it un|known?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97">
<Q REND="inline">A&s;k me not!"</Q> cried &s;he, ha&s;tily; <Q REND="inline">"it is all a mi&s;take."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor thing!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"this, then, is the &s;tring thy nerves endure not to have touched! &s;ooner will I expire than a breath of mine &s;hall make it vibrate! Oh &s;acred be thy &s;orrow, for thou can&s;t melt at that of the indigent!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then made a few general enqui|ries, and heard that the poor woman, who was a widow, had been obliged to give up her office, from the frequent attacks which &s;he &s;uffered of the rheumati&s;m; that &s;he had received much a&s;&s;i&s;tance both from the Rector and the Curate of &mdash; Church, but her continual illne&s;s, with the largene&s;s of her family, kept her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in &s;pite of all help.</P>
<P>Cecilia promi&s;ed to con&s;ider what &s;he could do for her, and then giving her more money, returned to Lady Margaret's.</P>
<P>Albany, who found that the unfortunate recollection of the Pew-Opener had awak|ened in his young pupil a melancholy train of reflections, &s;eemed now to compa&s;&s;ionate the &s;adne&s;s which hitherto he had reproved, and walking &s;ilently by her &s;ide till &s;he came to Soho-Square, &s;aid in accents of kindne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Peace light upon thy head, and di&s;&s;ipate thy woes!"</Q> and left her.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="98">
<Q REND="inline">"Ah when!"</Q> cried &s;he to her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"if thus they are to be revived for-ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who ob&s;erved that &s;ome|thing had greatly affected her, now expo&s;tu|lated warmly again&s;t Albany and his wild &s;chemes; <Q REND="inline">"You trifle with your own hap|pine&s;s,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"by witne&s;&s;ing the&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, and you will trifle away your fortune upon projects you can never fulfil: the very air in tho&s;e mi&s;erable hou&s;es is unwhole&s;ome for you to breathe; you will &s;oon be infected with &s;ome of the di&s;|ea&s;es to which you &s;o incautiou&s;ly expo&s;e your&s;elf, and while not half you give in charity will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e you wi&s;h, you will be plundered by cheats and &s;harp|ers till you have nothing left to be&s;tow. You mu&s;t be more con&s;iderate for your&s;elf, and not thus governed by Albany, who&s;e in|&s;anity is but partially cured, and who&s;e pro|jects are &s;o boundle&s;s, that the whole capital of the Ea&s;t India Company would not &s;uf|fice to fulfil them."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he liked not the &s;eve|rity of this remon&s;trance, acknowledged there was &s;ome truth in it, and promi&s;ed to be di&s;creet, and take the reins into her own hands.</P>
<P>There remained for her, however, no other &s;atisfaction; and the path which had thus been pointed out to her, grew more
<PB N="100" REF="99">
and more alluring every &s;tep. Her old friends, the poor Hills, now occurred to her memory, and &s;he determined to &s;ee her&s;elf in what manner they went on.</P>
<P>The &s;cene which this enquiry pre&s;ented to her, was by no means calculated to &s;trengthen Mr. Monckton's doctrine, for the pro&s;perity in which &s;he found this lit|tle family, amply rewarded the liberality &s;he had &s;hewn to it, and proved an irre|&s;i&s;tible encouragement to &s;imilar actions. Mrs. Hill wept for joy in recounting how well &s;he &s;ucceeded, and Cecilia, delighted by the power of giving &s;uch plea&s;ure, for|got all cautions and promi&s;es in the gene|ro&s;ity which &s;he di&s;played. She paid Mrs. Roberts the arrears that were due to her, &s;he di&s;charged all that was owing for the children who had been put to &s;chool, de|&s;ired they might &s;till be &s;ent to it &s;olely at her expence, and gave the mother a &s;um of money to be laid out in pre&s;ents for them all.</P>
<P>To perform her promi&s;e with the Pew|Opener was however more difficult; her ill health, and the extreme youth of her children making her utterly helple&s;s: but the&s;e were not con&s;iderations for Cecilia to de&s;ert her, but rather motives for regarding her as more peculiarly an object of charity. She found &s;he had once been a clear&s;tarcher,
<PB N="101" REF="100">
and was a tolerable plain work|woman; &s;he re&s;olved, therefore, to &s;end her into the country, where &s;he hoped to be able to get her &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, and knew that at lea&s;t, &s;he could help her, if un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, and &s;ee that her children were brought up to u&s;eful employments. The woman her&s;elf was enchanted at the plan, and firmly per&s;uaded the country air would re&s;tore her health. Cecilia told her only to wait till &s;he was well enough to travel, and promi&s;ed, in the mean time, to look out &s;ome little habitation for her. She then gave her money to pay her bills, and for her journey, and writing a full direction where &s;he would hear of her at Bury, took leave of her till that time.</P>

<P>THIS matter being &s;ettled at breakfa&s;t, Cecilia, having but one day more to &s;pend in London, knew not how to let it pa&s;s without taking leave of Henrietta, though &s;he cho&s;e not again to expo&s;e her|&s;elf to the forward in&s;inuations of her mo|ther; &s;he &s;ent her, therefore, a &s;hort note, begging to &s;ee her at Lady Margaret's, and acquainting her that the next day &s;he was going out of town.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My mother is gone to market, and I mu&s;t not go out without her leave; I have run to the door at every knock this whole week in hopes you were coming, and my heart has jumpt at every coach that has gone through the &s;treet. Deare&s;t lady, why did you tell me you would come? I &s;hould not have thought of &s;uch a great honour if you had
<PB N="104" REF="103">
not put it in my head. And now I have got the u&s;e of a room where I can often be alone for two or three hours together. And &s;o I &s;hall this morning, if it was po&s;&s;ible my dear Mi&s;s Beverley could come. But I don't mean to be tea&s;ing, and I would not be im|pertinent or encroaching for the world; but only the thing is I have a great deal to &s;ay to you, and if you was not &s;o rich a lady, and &s;o much above me, I am &s;ure I &s;hould love you better than any body in the whole world, almo&s;t; and now I dare &s;ay I &s;han't &s;ee you at all; for it rains very hard, and my mother, I know, will be &s;adly angry if I a&s;k to go in a coach. O dear! I don't know what I can do! for it will half break my heart, if my dear Mi&s;s Beverley &s;hould go out of town, and I not &s;ee her!</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This artle&s;s remon&s;trance, joined to the intelligence that &s;he could &s;ee her alone, made Cecilia in&s;tantly order a chair, and go her&s;elf to Portland-&s;treet: for &s;he found by this letter there was much doubt if &s;he could otherwi&s;e &s;ee her, and the earne&s;tne&s;s of Henrietta made her now not endure to di&s;|appoint her. <Q REND="inline">"She has much, cried &s;he,
<PB N="105" REF="104">
to &s;ay to me, and I will no longer refu&s;e to hear her; &s;he &s;hall unbo&s;om to me her gentle heart, for we have now nothing to fear from each other. She promi&s;es her&s;elf plea&s;ure from the communication, and doubtle&s;s it mu&s;t be &s;ome relief to her. Oh were there any friendly bo&s;om, in which I might my&s;elf confide!&mdash;happier Henriet|ta! le&s;s fearful of thy pride, le&s;s tenacious of thy dignity! thy &s;orrows at lea&s;t &s;eek the con&s;olation of &s;ympathy,&mdash;mine, alas! fettered by prudence, mu&s;t fly it!"</Q></P>
<P>She was &s;hewn into the parlour, which &s;he had the plea&s;ure to find empty; and, in an in&s;tant, the warm-hearted Henrietta was in her arms. <Q REND="inline">"This is &s;weet of you indeed,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for I did not know how to a&s;k it, though it rains &s;o hard I could not have walked to you, and I don't know what I &s;hould have done, if you had gone away and quite forgot me."</Q></P>
<P>She then took her into the back parlour, which &s;he &s;aid they had lately hired, and, as it was made but little u&s;e of, &s;he had it al|mo&s;t entirely to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>There had pa&s;&s;ed a &s;ad &s;cene, &s;he told her, at the meeting with her brother, though now they were a little more comfortable; yet, her mother, &s;he was &s;ure, would never be at re&s;t till he got into &s;ome higher way of life; <Q REND="inline">"And, indeed, I have &s;ome hopes,"</Q>
<PB N="106" REF="105">
&s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"that we &s;hall be able by and bye to do &s;omething better for him; for he has got one friend in the world, yet, thank God, and &s;uch a noble friend!&mdash;in|deed I believe he can do whatever he plea&s;es for him,&mdash;that is I mean I believe if he was to a&s;k any thing for him, there's nobody would deny him. And this is what I want|ed to talk to you about."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who doubted not but &s;he meant Delvile, &s;carce knew how to pre&s;s the &s;ub|ject, though &s;he came with no other view: Henrietta, however, too eager to want &s;oli|citation, went on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But the que&s;tion is whether we &s;hall be able to prevail upon my brother to accept any thing, for he grows more and more un|willing to be obliged, and the rea&s;on is, that being poor, he is afraid, I believe, people &s;hould think he wants to beg of them: though if they knew him as well as I do, they would not long think that, for I am &s;ure he would a great deal rather be &s;tarved to death. But indeed, to &s;ay the truth, I am afraid he has been &s;adly to blame in this affair, and quarrelled when there was no need to be affronted; for I have &s;een a gentleman who knows a great deal better than my brother what people &s;hould do, and he &s;ays he took every thing
<PB N="107" REF="106">
wrong that was done, all the time he was at Lord Vannelt's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how does this gentleman know it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O becau&s;e he went him&s;elf to enquire about it; for he knows Lord Vannelt very well, and it was by his means my brother came acquainted with him. And this gen|tleman would not have wi&s;hed my brother to be u&s;ed ill any more than I &s;hould my|&s;elf, &s;o I am &s;ure I may believe what he &s;ays. But my poor brother, not being a lord him&s;elf, thought every body meant to be rude to him, and becau&s;e he knew he was poor, he &s;u&s;pected they all behaved di&s;re&s;pectfully to him. But this gentleman gave me his word that every body liked him and e&s;teemed him, and if he would not have been &s;o &s;u&s;picious, they would all have done any thing for him in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know this gentleman very well, then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">O no, madam!</Q> "&s;he an&s;wered ha&s;tily," <Q REND="inline">I don't know him at all! he only comes here to &s;ee my brother; it would be very impertinent for me to call him an acquain|tance of mine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Was it before your brother, then, he held this conver&s;ation with you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, my brother would have been
<PB N="108" REF="107">
affronted with him, too, if he had! but he called here to enquire for him at the time when he was lo&s;t to us, and my mother quite went down upon her knees to him to beg him to go to Lord Vannelt's, and make excu&s;es for him, if he had not behaved pro|perly: but if my brother was to know this, he would hardly &s;peak to her again! &s;o when this gentleman came next, I begged him not to mention it, for my mother hap|pened to be out, and &s;o I &s;aw him alone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And did he &s;tay with you long?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am, a very &s;hort time in|deed; but I a&s;ked him que&s;tions all the while, and kept him as long as I could, that I might hear all he had to &s;ay about my brother."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you never &s;een him &s;ince?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am, not once! I &s;uppo&s;e he does not know my brother is come back to us. Perhaps when he does, he will call."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you wi&s;h him to call?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me?"</Q> cried &s;he, blu&s;hing, <Q REND="inline">"a little;&mdash;&s;ometimes I do;&mdash;for my brother's &s;ake."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For your brother's &s;ake! Ah my dear Henrietta!&mdash;but tell me,&mdash;or <HI>don't</HI> tell me if you had rather not,&mdash;did I not once &s;ee you ki&s;&s;ing a letter? perhaps it was from this &s;ame noble friend?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was not a letter, madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="109" REF="108">
looking down, <Q REND="inline">"it was only the cover of one to my brother."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The cover of a letter only!&mdash;and that to your brother!&mdash;is it po&s;&s;ible you could &s;o much value it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam! <HI>You,</HI> who are always u&s;ed to the good and the wi&s;e, who &s;ee no other &s;ort of people but tho&s;e in high life, <HI>you</HI> can have no notion how they &s;trike tho&s;e that they are new to!&mdash;but I who &s;ee them &s;eldom, and who live with people &s;o very unlike them&mdash;Oh you cannot gue&s;s how &s;weet to <HI>me</HI> is every thing that belongs to them! whatever has but once been touched by their hands, I &s;hould like to lock up, and keep for ever! though if I was u&s;ed to them, as you are, perhaps I might think le&s;s of them."</Q></P>
<P>Alas! thought Cecilia, who by <HI>them</HI> knew &s;he only meant <HI>him,</HI> little indeed would further intimacy protect you!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We are all over-ready,"</Q> continued Henrietta, <Q REND="inline">"to blame others, and that is the way I have been doing all this time my|&s;elf; but I don't blame my poor brother now for living &s;o with the great as I u&s;ed to do, for now I have &s;een a little more of the world, I don't wonder any longer at his behaviour: for I know how it is, and I &s;ee that tho&s;e who have had good educations,
<PB N="110" REF="109">
and kept great company, and mixed with the world,&mdash;O it is another thing!&mdash;they &s;eem quite a different &s;pecies!&mdash;they are &s;o gentle, &s;o &s;oft-mannered! nothing comes from them but what is meant to oblige! they &s;eem as if they only lived to give plea|&s;ure to other people, and as if they never thought at all of them&s;elves!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah Henrietta!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;haking her head, <Q REND="inline">"you have caught the enthu&s;i|a&s;m of your brother, though you &s;o long condemned it! Oh have a care le&s;t, like him al&s;o, you find it as pernicious as it is alluring!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no danger for <HI>me,</HI> madam,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for the people I &s;o much admire are quite out of my reach. I hardly ever even &s;ee them; and perhaps it may &s;o happen I may &s;ee them no more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The people?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"are there, then, many you &s;o much di&s;|tingui&s;h?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh no indeed!"</Q> cried &s;he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"there is only one! there <HI>can</HI> be&mdash;I mean there are only a few&mdash;"</Q> &s;he checked her&s;elf, and &s;topt.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whoever you admire,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"your admiration cannot but honour: yet indulge it not too far, le&s;t it &s;hould wander from your heart to your peace, and make you wretched for life."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">
<Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!&mdash;I &s;ee you know who is the particular per&s;on I was thinking of! but indeed you are quite mi&s;taken if you &s;uppo&s;e any thing bad of me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bad of you!"</Q> cried Cecilia, embracing her, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;carce think &s;o well of any one!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I mean, madam, if you think I forget he is &s;o much above me. But in|deed I never do; for I only admire him for his goodne&s;s to my brother, and never think of him at all, but ju&s;t by way of comparing him, &s;ometimes, to the other people that I &s;ee, becau&s;e he makes me hate them &s;o, that I wi&s;h I was never to &s;ee them again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His acquaintance, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"has done you but an ill office, and happy it would be for you could you forget you had ever made it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I &s;hall never do that! for the more I think of him, the more I am out of hu|mour with every body el&s;e! O Mi&s;s Be|verley! we have a &s;ad acquaintance indeed! I'm &s;ure I don't wonder my brother was &s;o ahamed of them. They are all &s;o rude, and &s;o free, and put one &s;o out of counte|nance,&mdash;O how different is this per&s;on you are thinking of! he would not di&s;tre&s;s any body, or make one a&s;hamed for all the world! <HI>You</HI> only are like him! always gentle, always obliging!&mdash;&s;ometimes I think you mu&s;t be his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;once, too, I heard&mdash;but that was contradicted."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="111">
A deep &s;igh e&s;caped Cecilia at this &s;peech; &s;he gue&s;&s;ed too well what &s;he might have heard, and &s;he knew too well how it might be contradicted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely, <HI>you</HI> cannot be unhappy, Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> &s;aid Henrietta, with a look of mingled &s;urpri&s;e and concern.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have much, I own,"</Q> cried Cecilia, a&s;&s;uming more chearfulne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"to be thank|ful for, and I endeavour not to forget it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O how often do I think,"</Q> cried Hen|rietta, <Q REND="inline">"that you, madam, are the happie&s;t per&s;on in the world! with every thing at your own di&s;po&s;al,&mdash;with every body in love with you, with all the money that you can wi&s;h for, and &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s that no|body can envy you it! with power to keep ju&s;t what company you plea&s;e, and every body proud to be one of the number!&mdash;Oh if I could chu&s;e who I would be, I &s;hould &s;ooner &s;ay Mi&s;s Beverley than any prince&s;s in the world!"</Q></P>
<P>Ah, thought Cecilia, if &s;uch is my &s;itua|tion,&mdash;how cruel that by one dreadful blow all its happine&s;s &s;hould be thrown away!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Were I a rich lady, like you,"</Q> con|tinued Henrietta, <Q REND="inline">"and quite in my own power, then, indeed, I might &s;oon think of nothing but tho&s;e people that I admire! and that makes me often wonder that <HI>you,</HI> madam, who are ju&s;t &s;uch another as him&s;elf
<PB N="113" REF="112">
&mdash;but then, indeed, you may &s;ee &s;o many of the &s;ame &s;ort, that ju&s;t this one may not &s;o much &s;trike you: and for that rea&s;on I hope with all my heart that he will never be married as long as he lives, for as he mu&s;t take &s;ome lady in ju&s;t &s;uch high life as his own, I &s;hould always be afraid that &s;he would never love him as &s;he ought to do!"</Q></P>
<P>He need not now be &s;ingle, thought Ce|cilia, were that all he had cau&s;e to appre|hend!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I often think,"</Q> added Henrietta, <Q REND="inline">"that the rich would be as much happier for mar|rying the poor, as the poor for marrying the rich, for then they would take &s;omebody that would try to de&s;erve their kindne&s;s, and now they only take tho&s;e that know they have a right to it. Often and often have I thought &s;o about this very gentle|man! and &s;ometimes when I have been in his company, and &s;een his civility and his &s;weetne&s;s, I have fancied I was rich and grand my&s;elf, and it has quite gone out of my head that I was nothing but poor Hen|rietta Belfield!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did he, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia a little alarmed, <Q REND="inline">"ever &s;eek to ingratiate him&s;elf into your favour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, never! but when treated with &s;o much &s;oftne&s;s, 'tis hard always to remember
<PB N="114" REF="113">
ones meanne&s;s! You, madam, have no no|tion of that ta&s;k: no more had I my&s;elf till lately, for I cared not who was high, nor who was low: but now, indeed, I mu&s;t own I have &s;ometimes wi&s;hed my&s;elf richer! yet he a&s;&s;umes &s;o little, that at other times, I have almo&s;t forgot all di&s;tance between us, and even thought&mdash;Oh fooli&s;h thought!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tell it, &s;weet Henrietta, however!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will tell you, madam, every thing! for my heart has been bur&s;ting to open it|&s;elf, and nobody have I dared tru&s;t. I have thought, then, I have &s;ometimes thought,&mdash;my true affection, my faithful fondne&s;s, my glad obedience,&mdash;might make him, if he did but know them, happier in me than in a greater lady!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried Cecilia, extremely af|fected by this plaintive tenderne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I be|lieve it!&mdash;and were I him, I could not, I think, he&s;itate a moment in my choice!"</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta now, hearing her mother com|ing in, made a &s;ign to her to be &s;ilent; but Mrs. Belfield had not been an in&s;tant in the pa&s;&s;age, before a thundering knocking at the &s;treet-door occa&s;ioned it to be in&s;tantly re-opened. A &s;ervant then enquired if Mrs. Belfield was at home, and being an&s;wered by her&s;elf in the affirmative, a chair was brought into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114">
But what was the a&s;toni&s;hment of Cecilia, when, in another moment, &s;he heard from the next parlour the voice of Mr. Delvile &s;enior, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Your &s;ervant, ma'am; Mrs. Belfield, I pre&s;ume?"</Q></P>
<P>There was no occa&s;ion, now, to make a &s;ign to her of &s;ilence, for her own amaze|ment was &s;ufficient to deprive her of &s;peech.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Belfield; <Q REND="inline">"but I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you are &s;ome gentle|man to my &s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam,"</Q> he returned, <Q REND="inline">"my bu&s;i|ne&s;s is with your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now recovering from her &s;urpri&s;e, determined to ha&s;ten unnoticed out of the hou&s;e, well knowing that to be &s;een in it would be regarded as a confirmation of all that he had a&s;&s;erted. She whi&s;pered, there|fore, to Henrietta, that &s;he mu&s;t in&s;tantly run away, but, upon &s;oftly opening the door leading to the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he found Mr. Delvile's chairmen, and a footman there in waiting.</P>
<P>She clo&s;ed it again, irre&s;olute what to do; but after a little deliberation, &s;he concluded to out-&s;tay him, as &s;he was known to all his &s;ervants, who would not fail to mention &s;eeing her; and a retreat &s;o private was wor&s;e than any other ri&s;k. A chair was al&s;o in wait|ing for her&s;elf, but it was a hackney one, and &s;he could not be known by it; and her
<PB N="116" REF="115">
footman &s;he had fortunately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as he had bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act for her journey next day.</P>
<P>Mean-while the thinne&s;s of the partition between the two parlours made her hearing every word that was &s;aid unavoidable.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure, Sir, I &s;hall be very willing to oblige you,"</Q> Mrs. Belfield an&s;wered; <Q REND="inline">"but pray, Sir, what's your name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My name, ma'am,"</Q> he replied, in a rather elevated voice, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;eldom oblig|ed to announce my&s;elf; nor is there any pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity I &s;hould make it known. It is &s;ufficient I a&s;&s;ure you, you are &s;peaking to no very common per&s;on, and probably to one you will have little chance to meet with again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how can I tell your bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, if I don't &s;o much as know your name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My bu&s;ine&s;s, madam, I mean to tell my&s;elf; your affair is only to hear it. I have &s;ome que&s;tions, indeed, to a&s;k, which I mu&s;t trouble you to an&s;wer, but they will &s;ufficiently explain them&s;elves to prevent any difficulty upon your part. There is no need, therefore, of any introductory cere|monial."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield, wholly in&s;en&s;ible of this ambiguous greatne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"if you mean to make your name a &s;ecret."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Few names, I believe, ma'am,"</Q> cried

<P>Mrs. Belfield, overpowered, though hard|ly knowing with what, only &s;aid <HI>he was very welcome,</HI> and begged him to &s;it down.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Excu&s;e me, ma'am,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"My bu&s;ine&s;s is but of a moment, and my avocations are too many to &s;uffer my in|fringing that time. You &s;ay you have a &s;on; I have heard of him, al&s;o, &s;omewhere before; pray will you give me leave to en|quire&mdash;I don't mean to go deep into the matter,&mdash;but particular family occurrences make it e&s;&s;ential for me to know,&mdash;whether there is not a young per&s;on of rather a ca|pital fortune, to whom he is &s;uppo&s;ed to make propo&s;als?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lack-a-day, no, Sir!"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Belfield, to the infinite relief of Cecilia, who in&s;tantly concluded this que&s;tion referred to her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon, then; good morn|ing to you, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, in a tone that &s;poke his di&s;appointment; but

<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why there's nobody he'll &s;o much as put the que&s;tion to! there's a young lady at this very time, a great fortune, that has as much a mind to him, I tell him, as any man need de&s;ire to &s;ee; but there's no making him think it! though he has been brought up at the uni|ver&s;ity, and knows more about all the things, or as much, as any body in the king's dominions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, then,"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, in a voice of far more complacency, <Q REND="inline">"it is not on the &s;ide of the young woman that the difficulty &s;eems to re&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, no, Sir! he might have had her again and again only for a&s;king! She came after him ever &s;o often; but being brought up, as I &s;aid, at the univer&s;ity, he thought he knew better than me, and &s;o my preach|ing was all as good as lo&s;t upon him."</Q></P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of Cecilia at the&s;e &s;peeches could by nothing be equalled but the &s;hame of Henrietta, who, though &s;he knew not to whom her mother made them, felt all the di&s;grace and the &s;hock of them her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir,"</Q> continued Mrs. Bel|field, <Q REND="inline">"you know my &s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am; my acquaintance is&mdash;not very univer&s;al."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="118">
<Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, you are no judge how well he might make his own terms. And as to this young lady, &s;he found him out, Sir, when not one of his own natural friends could tell where in the world he was gone! She was the fir&s;t, Sir, to come and tell me news of him, though I was his own mother! Love, Sir, is prodigious for quickne&s;s! it can &s;ee, I &s;ometimes think, through bricks and mortar. Yet all this would not do, he was &s;o ob&s;tinate not to take the hint!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now felt &s;o extremely provoked, &s;he was upon the point of bur&s;ting in upon them to make her own vindication; but as her pa&s;&s;ions, though they tried her rea&s;on never conquered it, &s;he re&s;trained her&s;elf by con&s;idering that to i&s;&s;ue forth from a room in that hou&s;e, would do more towards &s;trengthening what was thus boldly a&s;&s;ert|ed, than all her prote&s;tations could have chance to de&s;troy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And as to young ladies them&s;elves,"</Q> continued Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"they know no more how to make their minds known than a baby does: &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e he'll &s;hilly &s;hally till &s;omebody el&s;e will cry &s;nap, and take her.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry report was &s;o impertinent,"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, with much di&s;plea&s;ure;
<PB N="120" REF="119">
<Q REND="inline">"young Mr. Delvile is not to be di&s;po&s;ed of with &s;o little ceremony; he knows bet|ter what is due to his family."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia here blu&s;hed from indignation, and Henrietta &s;ighed from de&s;pondency.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hould his family do better? I ne|ver heard they were any &s;o rich, and I dare &s;ay the old gentleman, being her guardian, took care to put his &s;on enough in her way, however it came about that they did not make a match of it: for as to old Mr. Del|vile, all the world &s;ays&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All the world takes a very great liber|ty,"</Q> angrily interrupted Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"in &s;aying any thing about him: and you will excu&s;e my informing you that a per&s;on of his rank and con&s;ideration, is not lightly to be mentioned upon every little occa&s;ion that occurs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Sir,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ed at this unexpected prohibi|tion, <Q REND="inline">"I don't care for my part if I never mention the old gentleman's name again!

<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>They</HI> &s;ay?"</Q> cried he, firing with rage, <Q REND="inline">"and who are <HI>they?</HI> be &s;o good as inform me that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, every body, Sir! it's his com|mon character."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="120">
<Q REND="inline">"Then every body is extremely inde|cent,"</Q> &s;peaking very loud, <Q REND="inline">"to pay no more re&s;pect to one of the fir&s;t families in England. It is a licentiou&s;ne&s;s that ought by no means to be &s;uffered with impunity."</Q></P>
<P>Here, the &s;treet-door being kept open by the &s;ervants in waiting, a new &s;tep was heard in the pa&s;&s;age, which Henrietta immediately knowing, turned, with uplifted hands to Cecilia, and whi&s;pered, <Q REND="inline">"How unlucky! it's my brother! I though the would not have returned till night!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely he will not come in here?"</Q> re|whi&s;pered Cecilia.</P>
<P>But, at the &s;ame moment, he opened the door, and entered the room. He was im|mediately beginning an apology, and &s;tart|ing back, but Henrietta catching him by the arm, told him in a low voice, that &s;he had made u&s;e of his room becau&s;e &s;he had thought him engaged for the day, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ged him to keep &s;till and quiet, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;t noi&s;e would di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>Belfield then &s;topt; but the embarra&s;&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of Cecilia was extreme; to find her in his room after the &s;peeches &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from his mother, and to continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> him in it by connivance, when &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had been repre&s;ented as quite at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">vice, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and provoked her im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">urably; and &s;he felt very angry with
<PB N="122" REF="121">
Henrietta for not &s;ooner informing her who&s;e apartment &s;he had borrowed. Yet now to remove, and to be &s;een, was not to be thought of; &s;he kept, therefore, fixed to her &s;eat, though changing colour every mo|ment from the variety of her emotions.</P>
<P>During this painful interruption &s;he lo&s;t Mrs. Belfield's next an&s;wer, and another &s;peech or two from Mr. Delvile, to who&s;e own pa&s;&s;ion and loudne&s;s was owing Bel|field's entering his room unheard: but the next voice that called their attention was that of Mr. Hob&s;on, who ju&s;t then walked into the parlour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what's to do here?"</Q> cried he, facetiou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"nothing but chairs and livery &s;ervants! Why ma'am, what is this your rout day?

<P><PB N="123" REF="122">
<Q REND="inline">"To know <HI>me!</HI>"</Q> repeated Mr. Delvile, &s;cornfully.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I can't &s;ay much, ma'am,"</Q> an|&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"as to my knowing the gentleman, being I have been in his company but once; and what I &s;ay is, to know a per&s;on if one leaves but a quart in a hog&s;head, it's two pints too much. That's my notion. But, Sir, that was but an un|gain bu&s;ine&s;s at 'Squire Monckton's t'other morning. Every body was no-how, as one may &s;ay. But, Sir, if I may be &s;o free, pray what is your private opinion of that old gen|tleman that talked &s;o much out of the way?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My private opinion, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; I mean if its no &s;ecret, for as to a &s;ecret, I hold it's what no man has a right to enquire into, being of its own na|ture it's a thing not to be told. Now as to what I think my&s;elf, my doctrine is this; I am quite of the old gentleman's mind about &s;ome things, and about others I hold him to be quite wide of the mark. But as to talking in &s;uch a whi&s;ky fri&s;ky manner that nobody can under&s;tand him, why it's tanta|mount to not talking at all, being he might as well hold his tongue. That's what <HI>I</HI> &s;ay.

<PB N="124" REF="123">
becau&s;e he happens to have but one leg, or one eye, or &s;ome &s;uch matter, why it's knowing nothing of bu&s;ine&s;s! it's what I call talking at random."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When you have fini&s;hed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"you will be &s;o good to let me know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't mean to intrude, Sir; that's not my way, &s;o if you are upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What el&s;e, Sir, could you &s;uppo&s;e brought me hither? However, I by no means purpo&s;e any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I have only a few words more to &s;ay to this gentlewo|man, and as my time is not wholly incon&s;e|quential, I &s;hould not be &s;orry to have an early opportunity of being heard."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall leave you with the lady directly, Sir; for I know bu&s;ine&s;s better than to in|terrupt it: but &s;eeing chairs in the entry, my notion was I &s;hould &s;ee ladies in the par|lour, not much thinking of gentlemen's go|ing about in that manner, being I never did it my&s;elf. But I have nothing to offer again&s;t that; let every man have his own way; that's what <HI>I &s;ay.</HI> Only ju&s;t let me a&s;k the lady before I go, what's the meaning of my &s;eeing two chairs in the entry, and only a per&s;on for one in the parlour? The gentleman, I &s;uppo&s;e, did not come in <HI>both;</HI> ha! ha! ha!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="124">
<Q REND="inline">"Why now you put me in mind,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;aw a chair as &s;oon as I come in; and I was ju&s;t going to &s;ay who's here, when this gentleman's coming put it out of my head."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why this is what I call Hocus Pocus work!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on; <Q REND="inline">"but I &s;hall make free to a&s;k the chairman who they are waiting for."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Belfield, however, anticipated him; for running into the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he ang|rily called out, <Q REND="inline">"What do you do here, Mi&s;ters? do you only come to be out of the rain? I'll have no &s;tand made of my entry, I can tell you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why we are waiting for the lady,"</Q> cried one of them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Waiting for a fiddle&s;tick!"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield; <Q REND="inline">"here's no lady here, nor no com|pany; &s;o if you think I'll have my entry filled up by two hulking fellows for no|thing, I &s;hall &s;hew you the difference. One's dirt enough of one's own, without taking people out of the &s;treets to help one. Who do you think's to clean after you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours; the lady bid us wait,"</Q> an&s;wered the man.</P>
<P>Cecilia at this di&s;pute could with plea|&s;ure have ca&s;t her&s;elf out of the window to avoid being di&s;covered; but all plan of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ape was too late; Mrs. Belfield called a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d for her daughter, and then, returning
<PB N="126" REF="125">
to the front parlour, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I'll &s;oon know if there's company come to my hou&s;e with|out my knowing it!"</Q> and opened a door leading to the next room!</P>
<P>Cecilia, who had hitherto &s;at fixed to her chair, now ha&s;tily aro&s;e, but in a confu&s;ion too cruel for &s;peech: Belfield, wondering even at his own &s;ituation, and equally con|cerned and &s;urpri&s;ed at her evident di&s;tre&s;s, had him&s;elf the feeling of a culprit, though without the lea&s;t knowledge of any cau&s;e: and Henrietta, terrified at the pro&s;pect of her mother's anger, retreated as much as po&s;|&s;ible out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of the di&s;covered, aba&s;hed, perplexed, and embarra&s;&s;ed! while that of the di&s;coverers, far different, was bold, delighted, and triumphant!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So!"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"why here's Mi&s;s Beverley!&mdash;in my &s;on's back room!"</Q> winking at Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why here's a lady, &s;ure enough!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"and ju&s;t where &s;he &s;hould be, and that is with a gentleman. Ha! ha! that's the right way, according to my notion! that's the true maxim for living agreeable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I came to &s;ee Mi&s;s Belfield,"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, endeavouring, but vainly, to &s;peak with compo&s;ure, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;he brought me in|to this room."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="126">
<Q REND="inline">"I am but this moment,"</Q> cried Belfield, with eagerne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"returned home; and un|fortunately broke into the room, from total ignorance of the honour which Mi&s;s Bever|ley did my &s;i&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peeches, though both literally true, &s;ounded, in the circum&s;tances which brought them out, &s;o much as mere ex|cu&s;es, that while Mr. Delvile haughtily marked his incredulity by a motion of his chin, Mrs. Belfield continued winking at him mo&s;t &s;ignificantly, and Mr. Hob&s;on, with &s;till le&s;s ceremony, laughed aloud.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have nothing more, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile to Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"to enquire, for the few doubts with which I came to this hou&s;e are now entirely &s;atisfied. Good morning to you, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Give me leave, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, ad|vancing with more &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"to explain, in pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who can be&s;t te&s;tify my veracity, the real circum&s;tances&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would by no means occa&s;ion you &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered he, with an air at once exulting and pompous, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ituation in which I &s;ee you abun|dantly &s;atisfies my curio&s;ity, and &s;aves me from the apprehen&s;ion I was under of being again convicted of a <HI>mi&s;take!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He then made her a &s;tiff bow, and went to his chair.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="127">
Cecilia, colouring deeply at this con|temptuous treatment, coldly took leave of Henrietta, and court&s;ying to Mrs. Belfield, ha&s;tened into the pa&s;&s;age, to get into her own.</P>
<P>Henrietta was too much intimidated to &s;peak, and Belfield was too delicate to fol|low her; Mr. Hob&s;on only &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"The young lady &s;eems quite da&s;hed;"</Q> but Mrs. Belfield pur&s;ued her with entreaties &s;he would &s;tay.</P>
<P>She was too angry, however, to make any an&s;wer but by a di&s;tant bow of the head, and left the hou&s;e with a re&s;olution little &s;hort of a vow never again to enter it.</P>
<P>Her reflections upon this unfortunate vi&s;it were bitter beyond mea&s;ure; the &s;itua|tion in which &s;he had been &s;urpri&s;ed,&mdash;clande&s;tinely concealed with only Belfield and his &s;i&s;ter,&mdash;joined to the po&s;itive a&s;&s;er|tions of her partiality for him made by his mother, could not, to Mr. Delvile, but ap|pear marks irrefragable that his charge in his former conver&s;ation was rather mild than over&s;trained, and that the connection he had mentioned, for whatever motives de|nied, was inconte&s;tably formed.</P>
<P>The apparent conviction of this part of the accu&s;ation, might al&s;o authori&s;e, to one but too happy in believing ill of her, an im|plicity faith in that which regarded her having
<PB N="129" REF="128">
run out her fortune. His determina|tion not to hear her &s;hewed the inflexibility of his character; and it was evident, not|with&s;tanding his parading preten&s;ions of wi&s;hing her welfare, that his inordinate pride was inflamed, at the very &s;uppo&s;ition he could be mi&s;taken or deceived for a mo|ment.</P>
<P>Even Delvile him&s;elf, if gone abroad, might now hear this account with exag|gerations that would baffle all his confi|dence: his mother, too, greatly as &s;he e&s;teemed and loved her, might have the matter &s;o repre&s;ented as to &s;tagger her good opinion;&mdash;the&s;e were thoughts the mo&s;t afflicting &s;he could harbour, though their probability was &s;uch that to bani&s;h them was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To apply again to Mr. Delvile to hear her vindication, was to &s;ubject her&s;elf to in|&s;olence, and almo&s;t to court indignity. She di&s;dained even to write to him, &s;ince his be|haviour called for re&s;entment, not conce&s;|&s;ion; and &s;uch an eagerne&s;s to be heard, in oppo&s;ition to all di&s;couragement, would be practi&s;ing a meanne&s;s that would almo&s;t merit repul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t inclination was to write to Mrs. Delvile, but what now, to her, was either her defence or accu&s;ation? She had &s;olemn|ly renounced all further intercour&s;e with her, &s;he had declared again&s;t writing again,
<PB N="130" REF="129">
and prohibited her letters: and, therefore, after much fluctuation of opinion, her deli|cacy concurred with her judgment, to con|clude it would be mo&s;t proper, in a &s;itua|tion &s;o intricate, to leave the matter to chance, and commit her character to time.</P>
<P>In the evening, while &s;he was at tea with Lady Margaret and Mi&s;s Bennet, &s;he was &s;uddenly called out to &s;peak to a young woman; and found, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he was no other than Henrietta.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"how ang|rily did you go away this morning! it has made me mi&s;erable ever &s;ince, and if you go out of town without forgiving me, I &s;hall fret my&s;elf quite ill! my mother is gone out to tea, and I have run here all alone, and in the dark, and in the wet, to beg and pray you will forgive me, for el&s;e I don't know what I &s;hall do!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sweet, gentle girl!</Q> cried Cecilia, af|fectionately embracing her, <Q REND="inline">"if you had excited all the anger I am capable of feeling, &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s as this would bani&s;h it, and make me love you more than ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta then &s;aid, in her excu&s;e, that &s;he had thought her&s;elf quite &s;ure of her brother's ab&s;ence, who almo&s;t always &s;pent the whole day at the book&s;ellers, as in writing
<PB N="131" REF="130">
him&s;elf he perpetually wanted to con&s;ult other authors, and had very few books at their lodgings: but &s;he would not mention that the room was his, le&s;t Cecilia &s;hould object to making u&s;e of it, and &s;he knew &s;he had no other chance of having the conver&s;a|tion with her &s;he had &s;o very long wi&s;hed for. She then again begged her pardon, and hoped the behaviour of her mother would not induce her to give her up, as &s;he was &s;hocked at it beyond mea&s;ure, and as her brother, &s;he a&s;&s;ured her, was as inno|cent of it as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Cecilia heard her with plea&s;ure, and felt for her an encrea&s;ing regard. The open|ne&s;s of her confidence in the morning had merited all her affection, and &s;he gave her the warme&s;t prote&s;tations of a friend&s;hip which &s;he was certain would be la&s;ting as her life.</P>
<P>Henrietta then, with a countenance that &s;poke the lightne&s;s of her heart, ha&s;tily took her leave, &s;aying &s;he did not dare be out longer, le&s;t her mother &s;hould di&s;cover her excur&s;ion. Cecilia in&s;i&s;ted, however, upon her going in a chair, which &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed her &s;ervant to attend, and take care him&s;elf to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it, joined to the tender and un|re&s;erved conver&s;ation of the morning, gave Cecilia the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire invite her to
<PB N="132" REF="131">
her hou&s;e in the country; but the terror of Mrs. Belfield's in&s;inuations, added to the cruel interpretations &s;he had to expect from Mr. Delvile, forbid her indulging this wi&s;h, though it was the only one that ju&s;t now &s;he could form.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A CALM.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA took leave over night of the family, as &s;he would not &s;tay their ri&s;ing in the morning: Mr. Monckton, though certain not to &s;leep when &s;he was going, forbearing to mark his &s;olicitude by quitting his apartment at any unu|&s;ual hour. Lady Margaret parted from her with her accu&s;tomed ungraciou&s;ne&s;s, and Mi&s;s Bennet, becau&s;e in her pre&s;ence, in a manner &s;carce le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The next morning, with only her &s;ervants, the moment it was light, &s;he &s;et out. Her journey was without incident or interrup|tion, and &s;he went immediately to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Bayley, where &s;he had &s;ettled to board till her own was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bayley was a mere good &s;ort of wo|man, who lived decently well with her &s;er|vants, and tolerably well with her neigh|bours, upon a &s;mall annuity, which made her ea&s;y and comfortable, though by no means &s;uperior to &s;uch an addition to her little income as an occa&s;ional boarder might produce.</P>

Here Cecilia continued a full month: which time had no other employment than what &s;he voluntarily gave to her&s;elf by ac|tive deeds of benevolence.</P>
<P>At Chri&s;tmas, to the no little joy of the neighbourhood, &s;he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her own hou&s;e, which was &s;ituated about three miles from Bury.</P>
<P>The better &s;ort of people were happy to &s;ee her thus &s;ettled among&s;t them, and the poorer, who by what they already had re|ceived, knew well what they &s;till might ex|pect, regarded the day in which &s;he fixed her&s;elf in her man&s;ion, as a day to them|&s;elves of pro&s;perity and triumph.</P>
<P>As &s;he was no longer, as hitherto, repair|ing to a temporary habitation, which at plea&s;ure &s;he might quit, and to which, at a certain period, &s;he could have no po&s;&s;ible claim, but to a hou&s;e which was her own for ever, or, at lea&s;t, could &s;olely by her own choice be transferred, &s;he determined, as much as was in her power, in quitting her de&s;ultory dwellings, to empty her mind of the tran&s;actions which had pa&s;&s;ed in them, and upon entering a hou&s;e where &s;he was permanently to re&s;ide, to make the expul|&s;ion of her pa&s;t &s;orrows, the ba&s;is upon which to e&s;tabli&s;h her future &s;erenity.</P>
<P>And this, though a work of pain and dif|ficulty, was not impracticable; her &s;en&s;ibility,
<PB N="135" REF="134">
indeed, was keen, and &s;he had &s;uffer|ed from it the utmo&s;t torture; but her feel|ings were not more powerful than her un|der&s;tanding was &s;trong, and her fortitude was equal to her trials. Her calamities had &s;addened, but not weakened her mind, and the words of Delvile in &s;peaking of his mother occurred to her now with all the conviction of experience, that <Q REND="inline">"evils ine|vitable are always be&s;t &s;upported, becau&s;e known to be pa&s;t amendment, and felt to give defiance to &s;truggling."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. IV. p. 83.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>A plan by which &s;o great a revolution was to be wrought in her mind, was not to be effected by any &s;udden effort of magna|nimity, but by a regular and even tenour of courage mingled with prudence. Nothing, therefore, appeared to her &s;o indi&s;pen&s;able as con&s;tant employment, by which a variety of new images might force their way in her mind to &s;upplant the old ones, and by which no time might be allowed for brood|ing over melancholy retro&s;pections.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t effort, in this work of mental reformation, was to part with Fidel, whom hitherto &s;he had almo&s;t involuntarily guard|ed, but whom &s;he only could &s;ee to revive the mo&s;t dangerous recollections. She &s;ent him, therefore, to the ca&s;tle, but without
<PB N="136" REF="135">
any me&s;&s;age; Mrs. Delvile, &s;he was &s;ure, would require none to make her rejoice in his re&s;toration.</P>
<P>Her next &s;tep was writing to Albany, who had given her his direction, to acquaint him &s;he was now ready to put in practice their long concerted &s;cheme. Albany in&s;tantly ha&s;ten|ed to her, and joyfully accepted the office of becoming at once her Almoner and her Mo|nitor. He made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;eek ob|jects of di&s;tre&s;s, and always but too certain to find them, of conducting her him&s;elf to their habitations, and then leaving to her own liberality the a&s;&s;i&s;tance their &s;everal ca&s;es demanded: and, in the overflowing of his zeal upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, and the rapture of his heart in thus di&s;po&s;ing, almo&s;t at his plea&s;ure, of her noble fortune, he &s;eemed, at times, to feel an exta&s;y that, from its novelty and its exce&s;s, was almo&s;t too exqui&s;ite to be borne. He joined with the beggars in pouring ble&s;&s;ings upon her head, he prayed for her with the poor, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ked her with the &s;uccoured.</P>
<P>The pew-opener and her children failed not to keep their appointment, and Cecilia pre&s;ently contrived to &s;ettle them in her neighbourhood: where the poor woman, as &s;he recovered her &s;trength, &s;oon got a little work, and all deficiencies in her power of maintaining her&s;elf were &s;upplied by her
<PB N="137" REF="136">
generous patrone&s;s. The children, how|ever, &s;he ordered to be coar&s;ely brought up, having no intention to provide for them but by helping them to common employ|ments.</P>
<P>The promi&s;e, al&s;o, &s;o long made to Mrs. Harrel of an apartment in her hou&s;e, was now performed. That lady accepted it with the utmo&s;t alacrity, glad to make any change in her &s;ituation, which con&s;tant &s;o|litude had rendered wholly in&s;upportable. Mr. Arnott accompanied her to the hou&s;e, and &s;pent one day there; but receiving from Cecilia, though extremely civil and &s;weet to him, no hint of any invitation for repeating his vi&s;it, he left it in &s;adne&s;s, and returned to his own in deep dejection. Ce|cilia &s;aw with concern how he nouri&s;hed his hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, but knew that to &s;uffer his vi&s;its would almo&s;t authori&s;e his feeding it; and while &s;he pitied unaffectedly the un|happine&s;s &s;he occa&s;ioned, &s;he re&s;olved to double her own efforts towards avoiding &s;imilar wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>This action, however, was a point of ho|nour, not of friend&s;hip, the time being long &s;ince pa&s;t that the &s;ociety of Mrs. Harrel could afford her any plea&s;ure; but the promi&s;es &s;he had &s;o often made to Mr. Harrel in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, though extorted from her merely by the terrors of the moment,
<PB N="138" REF="137">
&s;till were promi&s;es, and, therefore, &s;he held her&s;elf bound to fulfil them.</P>
<P>Yet far from finding comfort in this ad|dition to her family, Mrs. Harrel proved to her nothing more than a trouble and an in|cumbrance; with no inherent re&s;ources, &s;he was continually in &s;earch of occa&s;ional &s;upplies; &s;he fatigued Cecilia with wonder at the privacy of her life, and tormented her with propo&s;als of parties and entertain|ments. She was eternally in amazement that with powers &s;o large, &s;he had wi&s;hes &s;o confined, and was evidently di&s;appointed that upon coming to &s;o ample an e&s;tate, &s;he lived, with re&s;pect to her&s;elf and her family, with no more magnificence or &s;hew than if Heire&s;s to only 500<HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>But Cecilia was determined to think and to live for her&s;elf, without regard to un|meaning wonder or &s;elfi&s;h remon&s;trances; &s;he had neither ambition for &s;plendour, nor &s;pirits for di&s;&s;ipation; the recent &s;orrow of her heart had deadened it for the pre&s;ent to all per&s;onal ta&s;te of happine&s;s, and her only chance for regaining it, &s;eemed through the medium of be&s;towing it upon others. She had &s;een, too, by Mr. Harrel, how wretch|edly external brilliancy could cover inward woe, and &s;he had learned at Delvile Ca&s;tle to grow &s;ick of parade and grandeur. Her equipage, therefore, was without glare,
<PB N="139" REF="138">
though not without elegance, her table was plain, though ho&s;pitably plentiful, her &s;ervants were for u&s;e, though too numerous to be for labour. The &s;y&s;tem of her oeco|nomy, like that of her liberality, was form|ed by rules of rea&s;on, and her own ideas of right, and not by compliance with example, nor by emulation with the gentry in her neighbourhood.</P>
<P>But though thus deviating in her actions from the u&s;ual cu&s;toms of the young and rich, &s;he was peculiarly careful not to of|fend them by &s;ingularity of manners. When &s;he mixed with them, &s;he was ea&s;y, unaffected, and well bred, and though &s;he &s;aw them but &s;eldom, her good humour and de&s;ire of obliging kept them always her friends. The plan &s;he had early formed at Mrs. Harrel's &s;he now &s;tudied daily to put in practice; but that part by which the u&s;e|le&s;s or frivolous were to be excluded her hou&s;e, &s;he found could only be &s;upported by driving from her half her acquaintance.</P>
<P>Another part, al&s;o, of that project &s;he found &s;till le&s;s ea&s;y of adoption, which was &s;olacing her&s;elf with the &s;ociety of the wi&s;e, good, and intelligent. Few an&s;wered this de&s;cription, and tho&s;e few were with diffi|culty attainable. Many might with joy have &s;ought out her liberal dwelling, but no one had idly waited till the moment it was at her di&s;po&s;al. All who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once
<PB N="140" REF="139">
both talents and wealth, were &s;o generally courted they were rarely to be procured; and all who to talents alone owed their con|&s;equence, demanded, if worth acquiring, time and delicacy to be obtained. Fortune &s;he knew, however, was &s;o often at war with Nature, that &s;he doubted not &s;hortly meet|ing tho&s;e who would gladly avail them|&s;elves of her offered protection.</P>
<P>Yet, tired of the murmurs of Mrs. Har|rel, &s;he longed for &s;ome relief from her &s;o|ciety, and her de&s;ire daily grew &s;tronger to owe that relief to Henrietta Belfield. The more &s;he meditated upon this wi&s;h, the le&s;s unattainable it appeared to her, till by fre|quently combating its difficulties, &s;he be|gan to con&s;ider them imaginary: Mrs. Bel|field, while her &s;on was actually with her&s;elf, might &s;ee &s;he took not Henrietta as his ap|pendage; and Mr. Delvile, &s;hould he make further enquiries, might hear that her real connection was with the &s;i&s;ter, &s;ince &s;he re|ceived her in the country, where the brother made no pretence to follow her. She con|&s;idered, too, how ill &s;he &s;hould be rewarded in giving up Henrietta for Mr. Delvile, who was already determined to think ill of her, and who&s;e prejudices no &s;acrifice would remove.</P>
<P>Having he&s;itated, therefore, &s;ome time be|tween the de&s;ire of pre&s;ent alleviation, and
<PB N="141" REF="140">
the fear of future mi&s;chief, the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of her own innocence at length van|qui&s;hed all dread of unju&s;t cen&s;ure, and &s;he wrote an invitation to Henrietta enclo&s;ed in a letter to her mother.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer of Henrietta expre&s;&s;ed her rapture at the propo&s;al; and that of Mrs. Belfield made no objection but to the ex|pence.</P>
<P>Cecilia, therefore, &s;ent her own maid to travel with her into Suffolk, with proper directions to pay for the journey.</P>
<P>The gratitude of the delighted Henrietta at the meeting was boundle&s;s; and her joy at &s;o unexpected a mark of favour made her half wild. Cecilia &s;uffered it not to lan|gui&s;h for want of kindne&s;s to &s;upport it; &s;he took her to her bo&s;om, became the &s;oother of all her cares, and repo&s;ed in her, in return, every thought that led not to Delvile.</P>
<P>There, however, &s;he was uniformly &s;ilent; &s;olemnly and eternally parted from him, far from tru&s;ting the &s;ecret of her former con|nexion to Henrietta, the whole &s;tudy of her life was to drive the remembrance of it from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Henrietta now ta&s;ted a happine&s;s to which as yet her whole life had been a &s;tranger; &s;he was &s;uddenly removed from turbulent vulgarity to the enjoyment of
<PB N="142" REF="141">
calm elegance; and the gentlene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, in&s;tead of being tyrannically impo&s;ed upon, not only made her loved with affection, but treated with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous delicacy. Cecilia had her &s;hare in all the comfort &s;he be&s;towed; &s;he had now a friend to oblige, and a companion to conver&s;e with. She communicated to her all her &s;chemes, and made her the part|ner of her benevolent excur&s;ions; &s;he found her di&s;po&s;ition as amiable upon trial, as her looks and her manners had been engaging at fir&s;t &s;ight; and her con&s;tant pre&s;ence and con&s;tant &s;weetne&s;s, imperceptibly revived her &s;pirits, and gave a new intere&s;t to her exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Meantime Mr. Monckton, who returned in about a fortnight to the Grove, ob&s;erved the encrea&s;ing influence of Albany with the mo&s;t &s;erious concern. The bounties of Cecilia, exten&s;ive, magnificent, unlimited, were the theme of every tongue, and though &s;ometimes cen&s;ured and &s;ometimes admired, they were wondered at univer|&s;ally. He &s;uffered her for a while to go on without remon&s;trance, hoping her en|thu&s;ia&s;m would abate, as its novelty wore out: but finding that week following week was &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome fre&s;h act of beneficence, he grew &s;o alarmed and unea&s;y, he could re&s;train him&s;elf no longer. He &s;poke to her with warmth, he repre&s;ented
<PB N="143" REF="142">
her conduct as highly dangerous in its con&s;equence; he &s;aid &s;he would but court impo&s;tors from every corner of the king|dom, called Albany a lunatic, whom &s;he &s;hould rather avoid than obey; and in&s;inu|ated that if a report was &s;pread of her pro|ceedings, a charity &s;o prodigal, would ex|cite &s;uch alarm, that no man would think even her large and &s;plendid fortune, would en&s;ure him from ruin in &s;eeking her al|liance.</P>
<P>Cecilia heard this exhortation without either terror or impatience, and an&s;wered it with the utmo&s;t &s;teadine&s;s. His influence over her mind was no longer uncontrolled, for though her &s;u&s;picions were not &s;trength|ened, they had never been removed, and friend&s;hip has no foe &s;o dangerous as di&s;|tru&s;t! She thanked him, however, for his zeal, but a&s;&s;ured him his apprehen&s;ions were groundle&s;s, &s;ince though &s;he acted from inclination, &s;he acted not without thought. Her income was very large, and &s;he was wholly without family or connec|tion; to &s;pend it merely upon her&s;elf would be &s;omething &s;till wor&s;e than extravagance, it mu&s;t re&s;ult from wilfulne&s;s the mo&s;t in|excu&s;able, as her di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ition was naturally aver&s;e to luxury and expence. She might &s;ave indeed, but for whom? not a creature had &s;uch a claim upon her; and with regard
<PB N="144" REF="143">
to her&s;elf, &s;he was &s;o provided for it would be unnece&s;&s;ary. She would never, &s;he de|clared, run in debt even for a week, but while her e&s;tate was wholly clear, &s;he would &s;pend it without re&s;triction.</P>
<P>To his hint of any future alliance, &s;he only &s;aid that tho&s;e who di&s;approved her conduct, would probably be tho&s;e &s;he &s;hould di&s;approve in her turn; &s;hould &s;uch an event however take place, the retrench|ing from that time all her pre&s;ent peculiar expences, would &s;urely, in a clear 3000<HI>l.</HI> a|year, leave her rich enough for any man, without making it incumbent upon her at pre&s;ent, to deny her&s;elf the only plea&s;ure &s;he could ta&s;te, in be&s;towing that money which to her was &s;uperfluous, upon tho&s;e who re|ceived it as the prolongation of their exi&s;|tence.</P>
<P>A firmne&s;s &s;o deliberate in a &s;y&s;tem he &s;o much dreaded, greatly &s;hocked Mr. Monck|ton, though it intmidated him from oppo&s;|ing it; he &s;aw &s;he was too earne&s;t, and too well &s;ati&s;fied &s;he was right, to venture giving her di&s;g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> by controverting her ar|guments: the conver&s;ation, therefore, end|ed with new di&s;content to him&s;elf, and with an impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of Cecilia, that though he was zealous and friendly, he was &s;omewhat too worldly and &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>She went on, therefore, as before, di&s;tributing
<PB N="145" REF="144">
with a lavi&s;h hand all &s;he could &s;pare from her own hou&s;hold; careful of no|thing but of guarding again&s;t impo&s;ition, which, though &s;he &s;ometimes unavoidably endured, her di&s;cernment, and the activity of her inve&s;tigating diligence, &s;aved her from &s;uffering frequently. And the &s;teadi|ne&s;s with which &s;he repul&s;ed tho&s;e whom &s;he detected in deceit, was a check upon tricks and fraud, though it could not whol|ly put a &s;top to them.</P>
<P>Money, to her, had long appeared worth|le&s;s and valuele&s;s; it had failed to procure her the e&s;tabli&s;hment for which &s;he once flattered her&s;elf it &s;eemed purpo&s;ely de|&s;igned; it had been di&s;dained by the Del|viles, for the &s;ake of who&s;e connection &s;he had alone ever truly rejoiced in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it; and after &s;uch a conviction of its inef|ficacy to &s;ecure her happine&s;s, &s;he regard|ed it as of little importance to her&s;elf, and therefore thought it almo&s;t the due of tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es gave it a con&s;equence to which with her it was a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>In this manner with Cecilia pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t winter of her majority. She had &s;edu|lou&s;ly filled it with occupations, and her occupations had proved fertile in keeping her mind from idlene&s;s, and in re&s;toring it to chearfulne&s;s. Calls upon her attention
<PB N="146" REF="145">
&s;o &s;oothing, and avocations &s;o various for her time, had an&s;wered the great purpo&s;e for which originally &s;he had planned them, in almo&s;t forcing from her thoughts tho&s;e &s;orrows which, if indulged, would have re&s;t|ed in them ince&s;&s;antly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. AN ALARM.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pring was now advancing, and the weather was remarkably fine; when one morning, while Cecilia was walking with Mrs. Harrel and Henrietta on the lawn before her hou&s;e, to which the la&s;t dinner bell was ju&s;t &s;ummoning them, to return, Mrs. Harrel looked round and &s;topt at &s;ight of a gentleman galloping towards them, who in le&s;s than a minute ap|proached, and di&s;mounting and leaving his hor&s;e to his &s;ervant, &s;truck them all at the &s;ame in&s;tant to be no other than young Delvile!</P>
<P>A &s;ight &s;o unexpected, &s;o unaccountable, &s;o wonderful, after an ab&s;ence &s;o long, and to which they were mutually bound, almo&s;t wholly over-powered Cecilia from &s;urpri&s;e and a thou&s;and other feelings, and &s;he caught Mrs. Harrel by the arm, not knowing what &s;he did, as if for &s;uccour; while Henrietta with &s;carce le&s;s, though much more glad emotion, &s;uddenly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"'tis Mr. Delvile!"</Q> and &s;prang forward to meet him.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="147">
He had reached them, and in a voice that &s;poke hurry and perturbation, re&s;pect|fully made his compliments to them all, before Cecilia recovered even the u&s;e of her feet: but no &s;ooner were they re&s;tored to her, than &s;he employed them with the quicke&s;t motion in her power, &s;till leaning upon Mrs. Harrel, to ha&s;ten into the hou&s;e. Her &s;olemn promi&s;e to Mrs. Delvile became uppermo&s;t in her thoughts, and her &s;urpri&s;e was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by di&s;plea&s;ure, that thus, without any preparation, he forced her to break it by an interview &s;he had no means to prevent.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they reached the entrance into the hou&s;e, the Butler came to tell Cecilia that dinner was upon the table. Delvile then went up to her, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"May I wait upon you for one in&s;tant before&mdash;or after you dine?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am engaged, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, though hardly able to &s;peak, <Q REND="inline">"for the whole day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will not, I hope, refu&s;e to hear me,"</Q> cried he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot write what I have to &s;ay,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no occa&s;ion that you &s;hould, Sir,"</Q> interrupted &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince I &s;hould &s;carcely find time to read it."</Q></P>
<P>She then court&s;ied, though without look|ing at him, and went into the hou&s;e; Delvile
<PB N="149" REF="148">
remaining in utter di&s;may, not daring, however wi&s;hing, to follow her. But when Mrs. Harrel, much &s;urpri&s;ed at behaviour &s;o unu&s;ual from Cecilia, approached him with &s;ome civil &s;peeches, he &s;tarted, and wi&s;hing her good day, bowed, and remount|ed his hor&s;e: pur&s;ued by the &s;oft eyes of Henrietta till wholly out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>They then both followed Cecilia to the dining-parlour.</P>
<P>Had not Mrs. Harrel been of this &s;mall party, the dinner would have been &s;erved in vain; Cecilia, &s;till trembling with emo|tion, bewildered with conjecture, angry with Delvile for thus &s;urpri&s;ing her, angry with her&s;elf for &s;o &s;everely receiving him, amazed what had tempted him to &s;uch a violation of their joint agreement, and ir|re&s;olute as much what to wi&s;h as what to think, was little di&s;po&s;ed for eating, and with difficulty compelled her&s;elf to do the honours of her table.</P>
<P>Henrietta, whom the &s;ight of Delvile had at once delighted and di&s;turbed, whom the behaviour of Cecilia had filled with wonder and con&s;ternation, and whom the evident inquietude and di&s;appointment which that behaviour had given to Delvile, had &s;truck with grief and terror, could not &s;wallow even a mor&s;el, but having cut her
<PB N="150" REF="149">
meat about her plate, gave it, untouched, to a &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, however, though &s;he had had her &s;hare in the &s;urpri&s;e, had wholly e&s;caped all other emotion; and only con|cluded in her own mind, that Cecilia could &s;ometimes be out of humout and ill bred, as well as the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>While the de&s;ert was &s;erving, a note was brought to Henrietta, which a &s;ervant was waiting in great ha&s;te to have an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Henrietta, &s;tranger to all forms of polite|ne&s;s, though by nature &s;oft, obliging and de|licate, opened it immediately; &s;he &s;tarted as &s;he ca&s;t her eye over it, but blu&s;hed, &s;park|led, and looked enchanted, and ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, without even a thought of any apo|logy, ran out of the room to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e quick eye, by a glance unavoidable, had &s;een the hand of Delvile, was filled with new amazement at the &s;ight. As &s;oon as the &s;ervants were gone, &s;he begged Mrs. Harrel to excu&s;e her, and went to her own apartment.</P>
<P>Here, in a few minutes, &s;he was followed by Henrietta, who&s;e countenance beamed with plea&s;ure, and who&s;e voice &s;poke tu|multuous delight. <Q REND="inline">"My dear, dear Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;uch a thing to tell you!&mdash;you would never gue&s;s it,&mdash;I don't know how to believe it my&s;elf,&mdash;but
<PB N="151" REF="150">
Mr. Delvile has written to me!&mdash;he has indeed! that note was from him.&mdash;I have been locking it up, for fear of accidents, but I'll run and fetch it, that you may &s;ee it your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>She then ran away; leaving Cecilia much perplexed, much unea&s;y for her&s;elf, and both grieved and alarmed for the too ten|der, too &s;u&s;ceptible Henrietta, who was thus ea&s;ily the &s;port of every airy and credulous hope.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I did not &s;hew it you,"</Q> cried Hen|rietta, running back in a moment, <Q REND="inline">"you would never think it po&s;&s;ible, for it is to make &s;uch a reque&s;t&mdash;that it has frightened me almo&s;t out of my wits!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then read the note.</P>
<LETTER>

<P><Q REND="inline">"If <HI>you</HI> can't, I am &s;ure, then, it is no wonder <HI>I</HI> can't! and I have been thinking of a million of things in a minute. It can't be about any bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e I know nothing in the world of any bu&s;ine&s;s; and it can't be about my brother, becau&s;e he would go to our hou&s;e in town about him, and there he would &s;ee him him&s;elf; and it can't be about my dear Mi&s;s Bever|ley, becau&s;e then he would have written the note to her: and it can't be about any body el&s;e, becau&s;e I know nobody el&s;e of his acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P>Thus went on the &s;anguine Henrietta, &s;ettling whom and what it could <HI>not</HI> be about, till &s;he left but the one thing to which her wi&s;hes pointed that it <HI>could</HI> be about. Cecilia heard her with true com|pa&s;&s;ion, certain that &s;he was deceiving her|&s;elf with imaginations the mo&s;t pernicious; yet unable to know how to quell them, while in &s;uch doubt and darkne&s;s her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation was &s;oon interrupted, by a me&s;&s;age that a gentleman in the par|lour begged to &s;peak with Mi&s;s Belfield.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O deare&s;t, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q>
<PB N="153" REF="152">
cried Henrietta, with encrea&s;ing agitation, <Q REND="inline">"what in the world &s;hall I &s;ay to him, advi&s;e me, pray advi&s;e me, for I can't think of a &s;ingle word!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Henrietta, unle&s;s I knew what he would &s;ay to you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but I can gue&s;s, I can gue&s;s!"</Q>&mdash;cried &s;he, her cheeks glowing, while her whole frame &s;hook, <Q REND="inline">"and I &s;ha'n't know what in the whole world to an&s;wer him! I know I &s;hall behave like a fool,&mdash;I know I &s;hall di&s;grace my&s;elf &s;adly!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, truly &s;orry Delvile &s;hould &s;ee her in &s;uch emotion, endeavoured earne&s;tly to compo&s;e her, though never le&s;s tranquil her&s;elf. But &s;he could not &s;ucceed, and &s;he went down &s;tairs with expectations of happine&s;s almo&s;t too potent for her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Not &s;uch were tho&s;e of Cecilia; a dread of &s;ome new conflict took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, that mind &s;o long tortured with &s;truggles, &s;o lately re&s;tored to &s;erenity!</P>
<P>Henrietta &s;oon returned, but not the &s;ame Henrietta &s;he went;&mdash;the glow, the hope, the flutter were all over; &s;he looked pale and wan, but attempting, as &s;he en|tered the room, to call up a &s;mile, &s;he failed, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Cecilia threw her arms round her neck, and tried to con&s;ole her; but, happy to hide her face in her bo&s;om, &s;he only gave
<PB N="154" REF="153">
the freer indulgence to her grief, and rather melted than comforted by her tenderne&s;s, &s;obbed aloud.</P>
<P>Cecilia too ea&s;ily conjectured the di&s;ap|pointment &s;he had met, to pain her by a&s;king it; &s;he forbore even to gratify her own curio&s;ity by que&s;tions that could not but lead to her mortification, and &s;uffering her therefore to take her own time for what &s;he had to cummunicate, &s;he hung over her in &s;ilence with the mo&s;t patient pity.</P>
<P>Henrietta was very &s;en&s;ible of this kind|ne&s;s, though &s;he knew not half its merit: but it was a long time before &s;he could ar|ticulate, for &s;obbing, that <HI>all</HI> Mr. Delvile wanted, at la&s;t, was only to beg &s;he would acquaint Mi&s;s Beverley, that he had done him&s;elf the honour of waiting upon her with a me&s;&s;age from Mrs. Delvile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From Mrs. Delvile?"</Q> exclaimed Ceci|lia, all emotion in her turn, <Q REND="inline">"good heaven! how much, then, have I been to blame? where is he now?&mdash;where can I &s;end to him?&mdash;tell me, my &s;weet Henrietta, this in&s;tant!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Oh madam!"</Q> cried Henrietta, bur&s;ting into a fre&s;h flood of tears, <Q REND="inline">"how fooli&s;h have I been to open my &s;illy heart to you!&mdash;he is come to pay his addre&s;&s;es to you!&mdash;I am &s;ure he is!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, no!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"indeed
<PB N="155" REF="154">
he is not!&mdash;but I mu&s;t, I ought to &s;ee him,&mdash;where, my love, is he?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In the parlour,&mdash;waiting for an an|&s;wer.&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who at any other time would have been provoked at &s;uch a delay in the delivery of a me&s;&s;age &s;o important, felt now nothing but concern for Henrietta, whom &s;he ha&s;tily ki&s;&s;ed, but in&s;tantly, however, quitted, and hurried to Delvile, with expectations almo&s;t equally &s;anguine as tho&s;e her poor friend but the moment before had cru&s;hed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh now, thought &s;he, if at la&s;t Mrs. Delvile her&s;elf has relented, with what joy will I give up all re&s;erve, all di&s;gui&s;e, and frankly avow the faithful affection of my heart!"</Q></P>
<P>Delvile received her not with the eager|ne&s;s with which he had fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed her; he looked extremely di&s;turbed, and, even after her entrance, undetermined how to begin.</P>
<P>She waited, however, his explanation in &s;ilence; and, after an irre&s;olute pau&s;e, he &s;aid, with a gravity not wholly free from re&s;entment, <Q REND="inline">"I pre&s;umed, madam, to wait upon you from the permi&s;&s;ion of my mother; but I believe I have obtained it &s;o late, that the influence I hoped from it is pa&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="155">
<Q REND="inline">"I had no means, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, chearfully, <Q REND="inline">"to know that you came from her: I &s;hould el&s;e have received her com|mands without any he&s;itation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would thank you for the honour you do her, were it le&s;s pointedly exclu&s;ive. I have, however, no right of reproach! yet &s;uffer me to a&s;k, could you, madam, after &s;uch a parting, after a renunciation &s;o ab|&s;olute of all future claim upon you, which though extorted from me by duty, I was bound, having promi&s;ed, to fulfil by prin|ciple,&mdash;could you imagine me &s;o un&s;teady, &s;o di&s;honourable, as to obtrude my&s;elf into your pre&s;ence while that promi&s;e was &s;till in force?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I find,</Q> cried Cecilia, in whom a &s;ecret hope every moment grew &s;tronger, <Q REND="inline">"I have been too ha&s;ty; I did indeed believe Mrs. Delvile would never authori&s;e &s;uch a vi&s;it; but as you have &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed me, I have a right to your pardon for a little doubt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There &s;poke Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> cried Delvile, re-animating at this little apology, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ame, the unaltered Mi&s;s Beverley I hoped to find!&mdash;yet <HI>is</HI> &s;he unaltered? am I not too precipitate? and is the tale I have heard about Belfield a dream? an error? a fal&s;ehood?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">But that &s;o quick a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of quarrels,"</Q>
<PB N="157" REF="156">
&s;aid Cecilia, half &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"would be endle&s;s perplexity, I, now, would be affronted that you can a&s;k me &s;uch a que&s;tion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Had I, indeed, <HI>thought</HI> it a que&s;tion,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I would not have a&s;ked it: but never for a moment did I credit it, till the rigour of your repul&s;e alarmed me. You have conde&s;cended, now, to account for that, and I am therefore encouraged to make known to you the purpo&s;e of my venturing this vi&s;it. Yet not with confi|dence &s;hall I &s;peak if, &s;carce even with hope!&mdash;it is a purpo&s;e that is the offspring of de&s;pair,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">One thing, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, who now became frightened again, <Q REND="inline">"let me &s;ay before you proceed; if your purpo&s;e has not the &s;anction of Mrs. Delvile, as well as your vi&s;it, I would gladly be excu&s;ed hear|ing it, &s;ince I &s;hall mo&s;t certainly refu&s;e it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">I would mention nothing,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"without her concurrence; &s;he has given it me: and my father him&s;elf has permit|ted my pre&s;ent application."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cla&s;ping her hands together in the eagerne&s;s of her &s;urpri&s;e and delight.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible!</HI>"</Q> repeated Delvile, with a look of rapture; <Q REND="inline">"ah Mi&s;s Beverley!
<PB N="158" REF="157">
&mdash;once my own Cecilia!&mdash;do you, can you <HI>wi&s;h</HI> it po&s;&s;ible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">No, no!"</Q> cried &s;he, while plea&s;ure and expectation &s;parkled in her eyes, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h nothing about it.&mdash;Yet tell me how it has happened,&mdash;I am <HI>curious,</HI>"</Q> added &s;he, &s;mil|ing, <Q REND="inline">"though not intere&s;ted in it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What hope would this &s;weetne&s;s give me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"were my &s;cheme almo&s;t any other than it is!&mdash;but you cannot,&mdash;no, it would be unrea&s;onable,&mdash;it would be madne&s;s to expect your compliance!&mdash;it is next to madne&s;s even in me to wi&s;h it,&mdash;but how &s;hall a man who is de&s;perate be prudent and circum&s;pect?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Spare, &s;pare your&s;elf,"</Q> cried the inge|nuous Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"this unnece&s;&s;ary pain!&mdash;you will find from me no unnece&s;&s;ary &s;cru|ples."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know not what you &s;ay!&mdash;all no|ble as you are, the &s;acrifice I have to propo&s;e&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speak it,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"with confi|dence! &s;peak it even with certainty of &s;uc|ce&s;s! I will be wholly undi&s;gui&s;ed, and openly, hone&s;tly own to you, that no pro|po&s;al, no &s;acrifice can be mentioned, to which I will not in&s;tantly agree, if fir&s;t it has had the approbation of Mrs. Delvile."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile's gratitude and thanks for a conce&s;&s;ion never before &s;o voluntarily made
<PB N="15" REF="158">
to him, interrupted for a while, even his power of explaining him&s;elf. And now, for the fir&s;t time, Cecilia's &s;incerity was chearful, &s;ince now, for the fir&s;t time, it &s;eemed oppo&s;ed by no duty.</P>
<P>When &s;till, therefore, he he&s;itated, &s;he her|&s;elf held out her hand to him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"what mu&s;t I do more? mu&s;t I offer this pledge to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For my life would I not re&s;ign it!"</Q> cried he, delightedly receiving it; <Q REND="inline">"but oh, how &s;oon will you withdraw it, when the only terms upon which I can hold it, are tho&s;e of making it &s;ign from it&s;elf its natu|ral right and inheritance?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, not comprehending him, only looked amazed, and he proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you, for my &s;ake, make &s;uch a &s;a|crifice as this? can you for a man who for yours is not permitted to give up his name, give up your&s;elf the fortune of your late uncle? con&s;ent to &s;uch &s;ettlements as I can make upon you from my own? part with &s;o &s;plendid an income wholly and for-ever?&mdash;and with only your paternal 10,000<HI>l.</HI> con|de&s;cend to become mine, as if your uncle had never exi&s;ted, and you had been Heir|e&s;s to no other wealth?"</Q></P>
<P>This, indeed, was a &s;troke to Cecilia un|equalled by any &s;he had met, and more cruel than any &s;he could have in re&s;erve.
<PB N="160" REF="159">
At the propo&s;al of parting with her uncle's fortune, which, de&s;irable as it was, had as yet been only productive to her of mi&s;ery, her heart, di&s;intere&s;ted, and wholly carele&s;s of money, was prompt to accede to the con|dition; but at the mention of her paternal fortune, that fortune, of which, now, not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige remained, horror &s;eized all her faculties! &s;he turned pale, &s;he trembled, &s;he involuntarily drew back her hand, and betrayed, by &s;peechle&s;s agi|tation, the &s;udden agonies of her &s;oul!</P>
<P>Delvile, &s;truck by this evident di&s;may, in&s;tantly concluded his plan had di&s;gu&s;ted her. He waited &s;ome minutes in anxious expectation of an an&s;wer, but finding her &s;ilence continue while her emotion encrea&s;|ed, the deepe&s;t crim&s;on dyed his face, and unable to check his chagrin, though not daring to confe&s;s his di&s;appointment, he &s;uddenly quitted her, and walked, in much di&s;order, about the room. But &s;oon reco|vering &s;ome compo&s;ure, from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pride, <Q REND="inline">"Pardon, madam,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"a trial &s;uch as no man can be vindicated in making. I have indulged a romantic whim, which your better judgment di&s;approves, and I receive but the mortification my pre|&s;umption de&s;erved."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know not then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia,
<PB N="161" REF="160">
in a faint voice, <Q REND="inline">"my inability to com|ply?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your ability, or inability, I pre&s;ume are elective?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh no!&mdash;my power is lo&s;t!&mdash;my for|tune it&s;elf is gone!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible! utterly impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cried he with vehemence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh that it were!&mdash;your father knows it but too well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My father!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did he, then, never hint it to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh di&s;traction!"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"what horrible confirmation is coming!"</Q> and again he walked away, as if wanting cou|rage to hear her.</P>
<P>Cecilia was too much &s;hocked to force upon him her explanation; but pre&s;ently returning to her, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"<HI>you,</HI> only, could have made this credible!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Had you, then, actually heard it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh I had heard it as the mo&s;t infamous of fal&s;hoods! my heart &s;welled with indig|nation at &s;o villainous a calumny, and had it not come from my father, my re&s;entment at it had been inveterate!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the fact is un|deniable! yet the circum&s;tances you may have heard with it, are I doubt not exag|gerated."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Exaggerated indeed!"</Q> he an&s;wered;
<PB N="162" REF="161">
<Q REND="inline">"I was told you had been &s;urpri&s;ed conceal|ed with Belfield in a back room, I was told that your parental fortune was totally ex|hau&s;ted, and that during your minority you had been a dealer with Jews! I was told all this by my father;&mdash;you may believe I had el&s;e not ea&s;ily been made hear it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet thus far,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"he told you but what is true; though&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True!"</Q> interrupted Delvile, with a &s;tart almo&s;t frantic. <Q REND="inline">"Oh never, then, was truth &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly wronged!&mdash;I denied the whole charge!&mdash;I di&s;believed every &s;yl|lable!&mdash;I pledged my own honour to prove every a&s;&s;ertion fal&s;e!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Generous Delvile!"</Q> cried Cecilia, melt|ing into tears, <Q REND="inline">"this is what I expected from you! and, believe me, in <HI>your</HI> inte|grity my reliance had been &s;imilar!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why does Mi&s;s Beverley weep?"</Q> cried he, &s;oftened, and approaching her, <Q REND="inline">"and why has &s;he given me this alarm? the&s;e things mu&s;t at lea&s;t have been mi&s;re|pre&s;ented, deign, then, to clear up a my&s;|tery in which &s;u&s;pen&s;e is torture!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, then, with what preci&s;ion and clearne&s;s her agitation allowed her, related the whole hi&s;tory of her taking up the mo|ney of the Jew for Mr. Harrel, and told, without re&s;erve, the rea&s;on of her trying to ab&s;cond from his father at Mrs. Belfield's.
<PB N="163" REF="162">
Delvile li&s;tened to her account with almo&s;t an agony of attention, now admiring her conduct; now re&s;enting her ill u&s;age; now compa&s;&s;ionating her lo&s;&s;es; but though variou&s;ly moved by different parts, receiv|ing from the whole the delight he mo&s;t coveted in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her in|nocence.</P>
<P>Thanks and applau&s;e the warme&s;t, both accompanied and followed her narration; and then, at her reque&s;t, he related in re|turn the &s;everal incidents and circum&s;tan|ces to which he had owed the permi&s;&s;ion of this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>He had meant immediately to have gone abroad; but the indi&s;po&s;ition of his mo|ther made him unwilling to leave the king|dom till her health &s;eemed in a &s;ituation le&s;s precarious. That time, however, came not; the Winter advanced, and &s;he grew evidently wor&s;e. He gave over, therefore, his de&s;ign till the next Spring, when, if &s;he were able, it was her de&s;ire to try the South of France for her recovery, whither he meant to conduct her.</P>
<P>But, during his attendance upon her, the plan he had ju&s;t mentioned occurred to him, and he con&s;idered how much greater would be his chance of happine&s;s in mar|rying Cecilia with &s;carce any fortune at all, than in marrying another with the large&s;t.
<PB N="164" REF="163">
He was convinced &s;he was far other than expen&s;ive, or a lover of &s;hew, and &s;oon flattered him&s;elf &s;he might be prevailed upon to concur with him, that in living together, though comparatively upon little, they &s;hould mutually be happier than in living a&s;under upon much.</P>
<P>When he &s;tarted this &s;cheme to his mo|ther, &s;he heard it with mingled admiration of his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and regret at its occa&s;ion: yet the loftine&s;s of her own mind, her high per&s;onal value for Cecilia, her anxiety to &s;ee her &s;on finally &s;ettled while &s;he lived, le&s;t his di&s;appointment &s;hould keep him &s;ingle from a la&s;ting di&s;gu&s;t, joined to a dejection of &s;pirits from an appre|hen&s;ion that her interference had been cruel, all favoured his &s;cheme, and forbid her re|&s;i&s;tance. She had often prote&s;ted, in their former conflicts, that had Cecilia been por|tionle&s;s, her objections had been le&s;s than to an e&s;tate &s;o conditioned; and that to give to her &s;on a woman &s;o exalted in her&s;elf, &s;he would have conquered the mere oppo|&s;ition of intere&s;t, though that of family honour &s;he held invincible. Delvile now called upon her to remember tho&s;e words, and ever &s;trict in fidelity, &s;he &s;till promi&s;ed to abide by them.</P>
<P>Ah! thought Cecilia, is virtue, then, as incon&s;i&s;tent as vice? and can the &s;ame character
<PB N="165" REF="164">
be thus high-&s;ouled, thus nobly di&s;in|tere&s;ted with regard to riches, who&s;e pride is &s;o narrow and &s;o in&s;urmountable, with re&s;pect to family prejudice!</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch a &s;acrifice from Cecilia her&s;elf, who&s;e income intitled her to &s;ettlements the mo&s;t &s;plendid, Mrs. Delvile thought &s;carce|ly to be &s;olicited; but as her &s;on was con|&s;cious he gave up in expectation no le&s;s than &s;he would give up in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he re&s;olved upon making the experiment, and felt an internal a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This matter being finally &s;ettled with his mother, the harder ta&s;k remained of van|qui&s;hing the father, by whom, and before whom the name of Cecilia was never men|tioned, not even after his return from town, though loaded with imaginary charges a|gain&s;t her. Mr. Delvile held it a diminu|tion of his own in the honour of his &s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e he wanted &s;till fre&s;h motives for re&s;igning her. He kept, therefore, to him&s;elf the ill opinion he brought down, as a re&s;ource in ca&s;e of danger, but a re|&s;ource he di&s;dained to make u&s;e of, unle&s;s driven to it by ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But, at the new propo&s;al of his &s;on, the accu&s;ation held in re&s;erve broke out; he called Cecilia a dabler with Jews, and &s;aid &s;he had been &s;o from the time of her uncle's death; he charged her with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="165">
general extravagance, to which he added a mo&s;t in&s;iduous attack upon her character, drawn from her vi&s;its at Belfield's of long &s;tanding, as well as the particular time when he had him&s;elf &s;urpri&s;ed her conceal|ed with the young man in a back parlour: and he a&s;&s;erted, that mo&s;t of the large &s;ums &s;he was continually taking up from her for|tune, were lavi&s;hed without &s;cruple upon this dangerous and improper favourite.</P>
<P>Delvile had heard this accu&s;ation with a rage &s;carce re&s;trained from violence; con|fident in her innocence, he boldly pronoun|ced the whole a forgery, and demanded the author of &s;uch cruel defamation. Mr. Delvile, much offended, refu&s;ed to name any authority, but con&s;ented, with an air of triumph, to abide by the effect of his own propo&s;al, and gave him a &s;uper|cilious promi&s;e no longer to oppo&s;e the marriage, if the terms he meant to offer to Mi&s;s Beverley, of renouncing her uncle's e&s;tate, and producing her father's fortune, were accepted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh little did I credit,"</Q> &s;aid Delvile in conclu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"that he knew indeed &s;o well this la&s;t condition was impracticable! his a&s;&s;ertions were without proof; I thought them prejudiced &s;urmi&s;es; and I came in the full hope I &s;hould convict him of his error. My mother, too, who warmly and
<PB N="167" REF="166">
even angrily defended you, was as firm|ly &s;atisfied as my&s;elf that the whole was a mi&s;take, and that enquiry would prove your fortune as undimini&s;hed as your puri|ty. How will &s;he be &s;hocked at the tale I have now to unfold! how irritated at your injuries from Harrel! how grieved that your own too great benevolence &s;hould be productive of &s;uch black a&s;per&s;ions upon your character!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have been,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"too facile and too unguarded; yet always, at the mo|ment, I &s;eemed but guided by common humanity. I have ever thought my&s;elf &s;ecure of more wealth than I could require, and regarded the want of money as an evil from which I was unavoidably exempted. My own fortune, therefore, appeared to me of &s;mall con&s;equence, while the reve|nue of my uncle en&s;ured me perpetual pro&s;perity.&mdash;Oh had I fore&s;een this mo|ment!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would you, then, have li&s;tened to my romantic propo&s;al?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would I have li&s;tened?&mdash;do you not &s;ee too plainly I could not have he&s;i|tated!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh yet, then, mo&s;t generous of hu|man beings, yet then be mine! By our own oeconomy we will pay off our mort|gages; by living a while abroad, we will
<PB N="168" REF="167">
clear all our e&s;tates; I will &s;till keep the name to which my family is bigotted, and my gratitude for your compliance &s;hall make you forget what you lo&s;e by it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speak not to me &s;uch words!"</Q> cried Cecilia, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing; <Q REND="inline">"your friends will not li&s;ten to them, neither, therefore, mu&s;t I."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My friends,"</Q> cried he with energy, <Q REND="inline">"are henceforth out of the que&s;tion: my father's concurrence with a propo&s;al he <HI>knew</HI> you had not power to grant, was in fact a mere permi&s;&s;ion to in&s;ult you; for if, in&s;tead of dark charges, he had given any authority for your lo&s;&s;es, I had my&s;elf &s;pared you the &s;hock you have &s;o unde&s;er|vedly received from hearing it.&mdash;But to con&s;ent to a plan which <HI>could</HI> not be accept|ed!&mdash;to make <HI>me</HI> a tool to offer indignity to Mi&s;s Beverley!&mdash;He has relea&s;ed me from his power by &s;o erroneous an exertion of it, and my own honour has a claim to which his commands mu&s;t give place. That honour binds me to Mi&s;s Beverley as forcibly as my admiration, and no voice but her own &s;hall determine my future de&s;tiny."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That voice, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"a|gain refers you to your mother. Mr. Del|vile, indeed, has not treated me kindly; and this la&s;t mock conce&s;&s;ion was unnece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="169" REF="168">
cruelty; but Mrs. Delvile merits my utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and I will li&s;ten to nothing which has not her previous &s;anction."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But will her &s;anction be &s;ufficient? and may I hope, in obtaining it, the &s;ecu|rity of yours?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When I have &s;aid I will hear nothing without it, may you not almo&s;t infer&mdash;I will refu&s;e nothing with it!"</Q></P>
<P>The acknowledgements he would now have poured forth, Cecilia would not hear, telling him, with &s;ome gaiety, they were yet unauthorized by Mrs. Delvile. She in&s;i&s;t|ed upon his leaving her immediately, and never again returning, without his mother's expre&s;s approbation. With regard to his father, &s;he left him totally to his own in|clination; &s;he had received from him nothing but pride and incivility, and determined to &s;hew publicly her &s;uperior re&s;pect for Mrs. Delvile, by who&s;e di&s;cretion and deci&s;ion &s;he was content to abide.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you not, then, from time to time,"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uffer me to con&s;ult with you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"do not a&s;k it! I have never been in&s;incere with you, never but from motives not to be overcome, re|&s;erved even for a moment; I have told you I will put every thing into the power of Mrs. Delvile, but I will not a &s;econd
<PB N="170" REF="169">
time ri&s;k my peace by any action unknown to her."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile gratefully acknowledged her goodne&s;s, and promi&s;ed to require nothing more. He then obeyed her by taking leave, eager him&s;elf to put an end to this new un|certainty, and &s;upplicating only that her good wi&s;hes might follow his enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>And thus, again, was wholly broken the tranquility of Cecilia; new hopes, however faint, awakened all her affections, and &s;trong fears, but too rea&s;onable, interrupted her repo&s;e. Her de&s;tiny, once more, was as unde|cided as ever, and the expectations &s;he had cru&s;hed, retook po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picions &s;he had conceived of Mr. Monckton again occurred to her; though unable to a&s;certain and unwilling to believe them, &s;he tried to drive them from her thoughts. She lamented, however, with bit|terne&s;s, her unfortunate connexion with Mr. Harrel, who&s;e unworthy impo&s;itions upon her kindne&s;s of temper and genero&s;ity, now proved to her an evil far more &s;erious and exten&s;ive, than in the mid&s;t of her repug|nance to them &s;he had ever apprehended.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A SUSPENSE.</HEAD>
<P>DELVILE had been gone but a &s;hort time, before Henrietta, her eyes &s;till red, though no longer &s;treaming, open|ed the parlour door, and a&s;ked if &s;he might come in?</P>
<P>Cecilia wi&s;hed to be alone, yet could not refu&s;e her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, madam,"</Q> cried &s;he, with a forced &s;mile, and con&s;trained air of bra|very, <Q REND="inline">"did not I gue&s;s right?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In what?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, unwilling to under&s;tand her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In what I &s;aid would happen?&mdash;I am &s;ure you know what I mean."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely embarra&s;&s;ed, made no an&s;wer; &s;he much regretted the circum&s;tances which had prevented an earlier communi|cation, and was uncertain whether, now, it would prove mo&s;t kind or mo&s;t cruel to acquaint her with what was in agitation, which, &s;hould it terminate in nothing, was unnece&s;&s;arily wounding her delicacy for the openne&s;s of her confidence, and which,
<PB N="172" REF="171">
however &s;erviceable it might prove to her in the end, was in the means &s;o rough and piercing &s;he felt the utmo&s;t repugnance to the experiment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You think me, madam, too free,"</Q> &s;aid Henrietta, <Q REND="inline">"in a&s;king &s;uch a que&s;tion; and indeed your kindne&s;s has been &s;o great, it may well make me forget my&s;elf: but if it does, I am &s;ure I de&s;erve you &s;hould &s;end me home directly, and then there is not much fear I &s;hall &s;oon be brought to my &s;en&s;es!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Henrietta, I can never think you too free; I have told you al|ready every thing I thought you would have plea&s;ure in hearing; whatever I have concealed, I have been fearful would only pain you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have <HI>de&s;erved,</HI> madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, with &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"to be pained, for I have behaved with the folly of a baby. I am very angry with my&s;elf indeed! I was old enough to have known better,&mdash;and I ought to have been wi&s;e enough."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t then be angry with your&s;elf, next,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, anxious to re-encourage her, <Q REND="inline">"for all the love that I bear you; &s;ince to your openne&s;s and frankne&s;s it was entirely owing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But there are &s;ome things that people &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be frank in; however, I am only

come now to beg you will tell me, madam, when it is to be;&mdash;and don't think I a&s;k out of nothing but curio&s;ity, for I have a very great rea&s;on for it indeed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What be, my dear Henrietta?&mdash;you are very rapid in your ideas!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will tell you, madam, what my rea|&s;on is; I &s;hall go away to my own home,&mdash;and &s;o I would if it were ten times a wor&s;e home than it is!&mdash;ju&s;t exactly the day before. Becau&s;e afterwards I &s;hall never like to look that gentleman in the face,&mdash;never, never!&mdash;for married ladies I know are not to be tru&s;ted!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be not apprehen&s;ive; you have no oc|ca&s;ion. Whatever may be my fate, I will never be &s;o treacherous as to betray my be|loved Henrietta to <HI>any</HI> body."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May I a&s;k you, madam, one que&s;tion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why did all this never happen be|fore?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried Cecilia, much di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed, <Q REND="inline">"I know not that it will happen now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what, dear madam, can hinder it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A thou&s;and, thou&s;and things! nothing can be le&s;s &s;ecure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And then I am &s;till as much puzzled as ever. I heard, a good while ago, and we all heard that it was to be; and I thought
<PB N="174" REF="173">
that it was no wonder, I am &s;ure, for I u&s;ed often to think it was ju&s;t what was mo&s;t likely; but afterwards we heard it was no &s;uch thing, and from that moment I always believed there had been nothing at all in it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t &s;peak to you, I find, with &s;in|cerity; my affairs have long been in &s;trange perplexity: I have not known my&s;elf what to expect; one day has perpetually rever&s;|ed the pro&s;pect of another, and my mind has been in a &s;tate of uncertainty and di&s;or|der, that has kept it&mdash;that &s;till keeps it from comfort and from re&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This &s;urpri&s;es me indeed, madam! I thought <HI>you</HI> were all happine&s;s! but I was &s;ure you de&s;erved it, and I thought you had it for that reward. And this has been the thing that has made me behave &s;o wrong; for I took it into my head I might tell you every thing, becau&s;e I concluded it could be nothing to you; for if great people loved one another, I always &s;uppo&s;ed they married directly; poor people, indeed, mu&s;t &s;tay till they are able to &s;ettle; but what in the whole world, thought I, if they like one another, &s;hould hinder &s;uch a rich lady as Mi&s;s Beverley from marrying &s;uch a rich gentleman at once?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, finding there was no longer any chance for concealment, thought it bet|ter to give the poor Henrietta at lea&s;t the
<PB N="175" REF="174">
gratification of unre&s;erved confidence, which might &s;omewhat &s;ooth her unea&s;ine&s;s by proving her reliance in her faith. She frankly, therefore, confe&s;&s;ed to her the whole of her &s;ituation. Henrietta wept at the recital with bitterne&s;s, thought Mr. Delvile a mon&s;ter, and Mrs. Delvile her&s;elf &s;carce human; pitied Cecilia with unaffect|ed tenderne&s;s, and wondered that the per&s;on could exi&s;t who had the heart to give grief to young Delvile! She thanked her mo&s;t gratefully for repo&s;ing &s;uch tru&s;t in her; and Cecilia made u&s;e of this opportunity, to enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of her &s;truggling more &s;eriou&s;ly to recover her indifferency.</P>
<P>She promi&s;ed &s;he would not fail; and for|bore &s;teadily from that time to name Del|vile any more: but the depre&s;&s;ion of her &s;pirits &s;hewed &s;he had &s;uffered a di&s;ap|pointment &s;uch as a&s;toni&s;hed even Cecilia. Thought mode&s;t and humble, &s;he had con|ceived hopes the mo&s;t romantic, and though &s;he denied, even to her&s;elf, any expectations from Delvile, &s;he involuntarily nouri&s;hed them with the mo&s;t &s;anguine &s;implicity. To compo&s;e and to &s;trengthen her became the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Cecilia; who, during her pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pen&s;e, could find no other em|ployment in which &s;he could take any in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="175">
Mr. Monckton, to whom nothing was unknown that related to Cecilia, was &s;oon informed of Delvile's vi&s;it, and ha&s;tened in the utmo&s;t alarm, to learn its event. She had now lo&s;t all the plea&s;ure &s;he had for|merly derived from confiding in him, but though aver&s;e and confu&s;ed, could not with&s;tand his enquiries.</P>
<P>Unlike the tender Henrietta's was his di&s;appointment at this relation, and his rage at &s;uch repeated trials was almo&s;t more than he could curb. He &s;pared neither the Del|viles for their in&s;olence of mutability in re|jecting or &s;eeking her at their plea&s;ure, nor her&s;elf for her ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in be|ing thus the dupe of their caprices. The &s;ubject was difficult for Cecilia to dilate up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;he wi&s;hed to clear, as he de&s;erved, Delvile him&s;elf from any &s;hare in the cen|&s;ure, and &s;he felt hurt and offended at the charge of her own improper readine&s;s; yet &s;hame and pride united in preventing much vindication of either, and &s;he heard almo&s;t in &s;ilence what with pain &s;he bore to hear at all.</P>
<P>He now &s;aw, with inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;turb|ance, that whatever was his power to make her unea&s;y, he had none to make her re|tract, and that the conditional promi&s;e &s;he had given Delvile to be wholly governed by
<PB N="177" REF="176">
his mother, &s;he was firm in regarding to be as &s;acred as one made at the altar.</P>
<P>Perceiving this, he dared tru&s;t his tem|per with no further debate; he a&s;&s;umed a momentary calmne&s;s for the purpo&s;e of taking leave of her, and with pretended good wi&s;hes for her happine&s;s, whatever might be her determination, he &s;tifled the reproaches with which his whole heart was &s;welling, and precipitately left her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, affected by his earne&s;tne&s;s, yet perplexed in all her opinions, was glad to be relieved from u&s;ele&s;s exhortations, and not &s;orry, in her pre&s;ent uncertainty, that his vi&s;it was not repeated.</P>
<P>She neither &s;aw nor heard from Delvile for a week, and augured nothing but evil from &s;uch delay. The following letter then came by the po&s;t.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>April 2d, 1780.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST write without comments, for I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with making any; I mu&s;t write without any beginning addre&s;s, for I know not how you will permit me to addre&s;s you.</P>
<P>I have lived a life of tumult &s;ince la&s;t compelled to leave you, and when it may &s;ub&s;ide, I am &s;till in utter ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="177">
The affecting account of the lo&s;&s;es you have &s;uffered thro' your beneficence to the Harrels, and the explanatory one of the ca|lumnies you have &s;u&s;tained from your kind|ne&s;s to the Belfields, I related with the plainne&s;s which alone I thought nece&s;&s;ary to make them felt. I then told the high ho|nour I had received, in meeting with no other repul&s;e to my propo&s;al, than was ow|ing to an inability to accede to it; and in|formed my mother of the conde&s;cending powers with which you had inve&s;ted her. In conclu&s;ion I mentioned my new &s;cheme, and firmly, before I would li&s;ten to any oppo&s;ition, I declared that though wholly to their deci&s;ion I left the relinqui&s;hing my own name or your fortune, I was not only by your genero&s;ity more internally yours than ever, but that &s;ince again I had ven|tured, and with permi&s;&s;ion to apply to you, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf hence forward unal|terably engaged to you.</P>
<P>And &s;o I do, and &s;o I &s;hall! nor, after a renewal &s;o public, will any prohibition but yours have force to keep me from throw|ing my&s;elf at your feet.</P>
<P>My father's an&s;wer I will not mention; I would I could forget it! his prejudices are irremediable, his re&s;olutions are inflex|ible. Who or what has worked him into him into an animo&s;ity &s;o irreclaimable, I cannot conjecture,
<PB N="179" REF="178">
nor will he tell; but &s;omething darkly my&s;terious has part in his wrath and his inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>My mother was much affected by your reference to her&s;elf. Words of the &s;weet|e&s;t prai&s;e broke repeatedly from her; no other &s;uch woman, &s;he &s;aid, exi&s;ted; no other &s;uch in&s;tance could be found of fide|lity &s;o exalted! her &s;on mu&s;t have no heart but for low and mercenary &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, if, after a proof of regard &s;o unexampled, he could bear to live without her! Oh how did &s;uch a &s;entence from lips &s;o highly re|verenced, animate, delight, confirm, and oblige me at once!</P>
<P>The di&s;plea&s;ure of my father at this de|claration was dreadful; his charges, always as improbable as injurious, now became too horrible for my ears; he di&s;believed you had taken up the money for Harrel, he di&s;|credited that you vi&s;ited the Belfields for Henrietta: pa&s;&s;ion not merely bani&s;hed his ju&s;tice, but clouded his rea&s;on, and I &s;oon left the room, that at lea&s;t I might not hear the a&s;per&s;ions he forbid me to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I left not, however, your fame to a weak champion: my mother defended it with all the &s;pirit of truth, and all the confidence of &s;imilar virtue! yet they parted without con|viction, and &s;o mutually irritated with each other, that they agreed to meet no more.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="179">
This was too terrible! and I in&s;tantly con&s;olidated my re&s;entment to my father, and my gratitude to my mother, into con|ce&s;&s;ions and &s;upplications to both; I could not, however, &s;ucceed; my mother was deeply offended, my father was &s;ternly inex|orable: nor here re&s;ts the evil of their di&s;|&s;ention, for the violence of the conflict has occa&s;ioned a return more alarming than ever of the illne&s;s of my mother.</P>
<P>All her faith in her recovery is now built upon going abroad; &s;he is earne&s;t to &s;et off immediately; but Dr. Ly&s;ter has advi&s;ed her to make London in her way, and have a con&s;ultation of phy&s;icians before &s;he de|parts.</P>
<P>To this &s;he has agreed; and we are now upon the road thither.</P>
<P>Such is, at pre&s;ent, the melancholy &s;tate of my affairs. My mother <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> me to write; forgive me, therefore, that I waited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;omething more deci&s;ive to &s;ay. I could prevail upon neither party to meet before the journey; nor could I draw from my father the ba&s;e fabricator of the calum|nies by which he has been thus abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Unhappily, I have nothing more to add: and whether intelligence, &s;uch as this, or total &s;u&s;pen&s;e, would be lea&s;t irk&s;ome, I know not. If my mother bears her journey tolerably well, I have yet one more effort
<PB N="181" REF="180">
to make; and of that the &s;ucce&s;s or the failure will be in&s;tantly communicated to Mi&s;s Beverley, by her eternally devoted, but half di&s;tracted</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MORTIMER DELVILE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Scarcely could Cecilia her&s;elf decide whether this comfortle&s;s letter or none at all were preferable. The implacability of Mr. Delvile was &s;hocking, but his &s;lander|ing her character was &s;till more intolerable; yet the prai&s;es of the mother, and her gene|rous vindication, joined to the invariable reliance of Delvile upon her innocence, conferred upon her an honour that offered &s;ome alleviation.</P>
<P>The mention of a fabricator again brought Mr. Monckton to her mind, and not all her unwillingne&s;s to think him capable of &s;uch treachery, could now root out her &s;u&s;|picions. Delvile's temper, however, &s;he knew was too impetuous to be tru&s;ted with this conjecture, and her fear of committing inju&s;tice being thus &s;econded by prudence, &s;he determined to keep to her&s;elf doubts that could not without danger be divulged.</P>
<P>She communicated briefly to Henrietta, who looked her earne&s;t curio&s;ity, the con|tinuance of her &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and to her own fate Henrietta became &s;omewhat more re|conciled, when &s;he &s;aw that no &s;tation in life rendered happine&s;s certain or permanent.</P>

<P>ANOTHER week pa&s;t &s;till without any further intelligence. Cecilia was then &s;ummoned to the parlour, and to Del|vile him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He looked hurried and anxious; yet the glow of his face, and the animation of his eyes, immediately declared he at lea&s;t came not to take leave of her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you forgive,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"the di&s;|mal and un&s;atisfactory letter I wrote you? I would not di&s;obey you twice in the &s;ame manner, and I could not till now have written in any other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The con&s;ultation with the phy&s;icians, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is over?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas, yes; and the re&s;ult is mo&s;t alarming; they all agree my mother is in a dangerous way, and they rather forbear to oppo&s;e, than advi&s;e her going abroad: but upon that &s;he is earne&s;tly bent, and in|tends to &s;et out without delay. I &s;hall re|turn to her, therefore, with all &s;peed, and mean not to take any re&s;t till I have &s;een her."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="182">
Cecilia expre&s;&s;ed with tenderne&s;s her &s;or|row for Mrs. Delvile: nor were her looks illiberal in including her &s;on in her con|cern.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t ha&s;ten,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to the cre|dentials by which I am authori&s;ed for com|ing, and I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to prove if Mi&s;s Beverley has not flattered my mother in her appeal."</Q></P>
<P>He then informed her that Mrs. Delvile, apprehen&s;ive for her&s;elf, and &s;oftened for him by the confe&s;&s;ion of her danger, which &s;he had extorted from her phy&s;icians, had tenderly re&s;olved upon making one final effort for his happine&s;s, and ill and impa|tient as &s;he was, upon deferring her journey to wait its effect.</P>
<P>Generou&s;ly, therefore, giving up her own re&s;entment, &s;he wrote to Mr. Delvile in terms of peace and kindne&s;s, lamenting their late di&s;&s;ention, and ardently expre&s;|&s;ing her de&s;ire to be reconciled to him be|fore &s;he left England. She told him the uncertainty of her recovery which had been acknowledged by her phy&s;icians, who had declared a calmer mind was more e&s;&s;ential to her than a purer air. She then added, that &s;uch &s;erenity was only to be given her, by the removal of her anxiety at the comfortle&s;s &s;tate of her &s;on. She begged him, therefore, to make known the author
<PB N="184" REF="183">
of Mi&s;s Beverley's defamation, a&s;&s;uring him, that upon enquiry, he would find her cha|racter and her fame as un&s;ullied as his own; and &s;trongly repre&s;enting, that after the &s;a|crifice to which &s;he had con&s;ented, their &s;on would be utterly di&s;honourable in thinking of any other connexion. She then to this rea&s;oning joined the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplication, prote&s;ting, in her pre&s;ent di&s;|ordered &s;tate of health, her life might pay the forfeiture of her continual unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>To the Honourable Mrs. DELVILE.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR extraordinary letter, madam, has extremely &s;urpri&s;ed me. I had been wil|ling to hope the affair over from the time my di&s;approbation of it was formally an|nounced. I am &s;orry you are &s;o much in|di&s;po&s;ed, but I cannot conclude your health would be re&s;tored by my acceding to a plan &s;o derogatory to my hou&s;e. I di&s;ap|prove it upon every account, not only of the name and the fortune, but the lady her|&s;elf. I have rea&s;ons more important than tho&s;e I a&s;&s;ign, but they are &s;uch as I am bound in honour not to mention. After &s;uch a declaration, nobody, I pre&s;ume, will affront me by a&s;king them. Her defence you have only from her&s;elf, her accu&s;ation I have received from authority le&s;s partial. I command, therefore, that my &s;on, upon pain of my eternal di&s;plea&s;ure, may never &s;peak to me on the &s;ubject again, and I hope, madam, from you the &s;ame complai|&s;ance to my reque&s;t. I cannot explain my|&s;elf further, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary; it is no news, I flatter my&s;elf, to Mortimer Delvile or his mother, that I do nothing without rea&s;on, and I believe nothing upon &s;light grounds.</P>

A few cold compliments concerning her journey, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of her health, concluded the letter.</P>
<P>Cecilia, having read, ha&s;tily returned it, and indignantly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My opinion, Sir, upon this letter, mu&s;t &s;urely be yours; that we had done wi&s;er, long &s;ince, to have &s;pared your mother and our&s;elves, tho&s;e vain and fruitle&s;s conflicts which we ought better to have fore&s;een were liable to &s;uch a conclu&s;ion.

<P><Q REND="inline">"O no,"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"rather let us now &s;purn it for ever! tho&s;e conflicts mu&s;t indeed be ended, but not by a &s;eparation &s;till more bitter than all of them."</Q></P>
<P>He then told her, that his mother, highly offended to ob&s;erve by the extreme coldne&s;s of this letter, the rancour he &s;till nouri&s;h|ed for the conte&s;t preceding her leaving him, no longer now refu&s;ed even her &s;epa|rate con&s;ent, for a mea&s;ure which &s;he thought her &s;on ab&s;olutely engaged to take.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"She has always maintained,"</Q> he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"an independent mind, always judged for her&s;elf, and refu&s;ed all other
<PB N="187" REF="186">
arbitration: when &s;o impetuou&s;ly &s;he part|ed us, my father's will happened to be her's, and thence their concurrence: my father, of a temper immoveable and &s;tern, retains &s;tubbornly the prejudices which once have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him; my mother, gene|rous as fiery, and noble as proud, is open to conviction, and no &s;ooner convinced, than ingenuous in acknowledging it: and thence their di&s;&s;ention. From my father I may hope forgivene&s;s, but mu&s;t never expect conce&s;&s;ion; from my mother I may hope all &s;he ought to grant, for pardon but her vehemence,&mdash;and &s;he has every great qua|lity that can dignify human nature!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e affection and reverence for Mrs. Delvile were unfeigned, and who loved in her &s;on this filial enthu&s;ia&s;m, readily con|curred with him in prai&s;ing her, and &s;in|cerely e&s;teemed her the fir&s;t among women.</P>

<HEAD>TO Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<P>MISERY, my &s;weet young friend, has long been bu&s;y with us all; much have we owed to the cla&s;h of different intere&s;ts, much to that rapacity which to enjoy any thing, demands every thing, and much to that general perver&s;ene&s;s which labours to place happine&s;s in what is with-held. Thus do we &s;truggle on till we can &s;truggle no longer; the felicity with which we trifle, at be&s;t is but temporary; and before rea&s;on and reflection &s;hew its value, &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow are commonly become &s;tationary.</P>
<P>Be it yours, my love, and my &s;on's, to profit by the experience, while you pity the errors, of the many who illu&s;trate this truth. Your mutual partiality has been mutually unfortunate, and mu&s;t always continue &s;o for the intere&s;ts of both: but how blind is it to wait, in our own peculiar lots, for that perfection of enjoyment we can all &s;ee wanting in the lot of others! My expectations for my &s;on had <Q REND="inline">"out|&s;teped the mode&s;ty of"</Q> probability. I looked for rank and high birth, with the fortune of Cecilia, and Cecilia's rare cha|racter. Alas! a new con&s;tellation in the
<PB N="189" REF="188">
heavens might as rationally have been look|ed for!</P>
<P>My extravagance, however, has been all for his felicity, dearer to me than life,&mdash;dearer to me than all things but his own ho|nour! Let us but &s;ave that, and then let wealth, ambition, intere&s;t, grandeur and pride, &s;ince they cannot con&s;titute his hap|pine&s;s, be removed from de&s;troying it. I will no longer play the tyrant that, weigh|ing good and evil by my own feelings and opinions, in&s;i&s;ts upon his acting by the no|tions I have formed, whatever mi&s;ery they may bring him by oppo&s;ing all his own.</P>
<P>I leave the kingdom with little rea&s;on to expect I &s;hall return to it; I leave it&mdash;Oh blindne&s;s of vanity and pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;from the effect of that violence with which &s;o lately I oppo&s;ed what now I am content to advance! But the extraordinary re&s;ignation to which you have agreed, &s;hews your heart &s;o wholly my &s;on's, and &s;o even more than worthy the whole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his, that it reflects upon him an honour more bright and more alluring, than any the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious other alliance could now confer.</P>
<P>I would fain &s;ee you ere I go, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;ee you no more; fain ratify by word of mouth the con&s;ent that by word of mouth I &s;o ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed! I know not how to come to Suffolk,&mdash;is it not po&s;&s;ible you can

come to London? I am told you leave to me the arbitration of your fate,&mdash;in giving you to my &s;on, I be&s;t &s;hew my &s;en&s;e of &s;uch an honour.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Cecilia wept over this letter with tender|ne&s;s, grief and alarm; but declared, had it even &s;ummoned her to follow her abroad, &s;he could not, after reading it, have he&s;itat|ed in complying.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O now, then,"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"let our long &s;u&s;pen&s;es end! hear me with the can|dour; my mother has already li&s;tened to me&mdash;be mine, my Cecilia, at once,&mdash;and force me not, by eternal &s;cruples, to ri&s;k another &s;eparation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven, Sir!"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;tarting, <Q REND="inline">"in &s;uch a &s;tate as Mrs. Delvile thinks her&s;elf, would you have her journey delayed?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="190">
<Q REND="inline">"No, not a moment! I would but en|&s;ure you mine, and go with her all over the world!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wild and impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;and what is to be done with Mr. Delvile?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is on his account wholly I am thus earne&s;tly precipitate. If I do not by an immediate marriage prevent his further in|terference, all I have already &s;uffered may again be repeated, and &s;ome fre&s;h conte&s;t with my mother may occa&s;ion another re|lap&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who now under&s;tood him, ar|dently prote&s;ted &s;he would not li&s;ten for a moment to any clande&s;tine expedient.</P>
<P>He be&s;ought her to be patient; and then anxiou&s;ly repre&s;ented to her their peculiar &s;ituations. All application to his father he was peremptorily forbid making, all efforts to remove his prejudices their impenetrable my&s;tery prevented; a public marriage, therefore, with &s;uch ob&s;tacles, would almo&s;t irritate him to phrenzy, by its daring defi|ance of his prohibition and authority.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"we can never do right but in parting!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Say it not,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I conjure you! we &s;hall yet live, I hope, to prove the con|trary."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you, then,"</Q> cried &s;he, re|proachfully, <Q REND="inline">"Oh Mr. Delvile! can you
<PB N="192" REF="191">
again urge me to enter your family in &s;e|cret?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I grieve, indeed,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"that your goodne&s;s &s;hould &s;o &s;everely be tried; yet did you not conde&s;cend to commit the arbitration to my mother?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True; and I thought her approbation would &s;ecure my peace of mind; but how could I have expected Mrs. Delvile's con|&s;ent to &s;uch a &s;cheme!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She has merely accorded it from a cer|tainty there is no other re&s;ource. Believe me, therefore, my whole hope re&s;ts upon your pre&s;ent compliance. My father, I am certain, by his letter, will now hear neither petition nor defence; on the contrary, he will only enrage at the temerity of offering to confute him. But when he knows you are his daughter, <HI>his</HI> honour will then be concerned in yours, and it will be as much his de&s;ire to have it cleared, as it is now to have it cen&s;ured."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wait at lea&s;t your return, and let us try what can be done with him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh why,"</Q> cried Delvile, with much earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t I linger out month after month in this wretched uncertainty!" If I wait I am undone! my father, by the orders I mu&s;t unavoidably leave, will di&s;cover the preparations making without his con&s;ent, and he will work upon you in my ab&s;ence, and compel you to give me up!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="192">
<Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, half &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"he would have &s;o much power?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am but too &s;ure, that the lea&s;t inti|mation, in his pre&s;ent irritable &s;tate of mind, reaching him of my intentions, would make him not &s;cruple, in his fury, pronouncing &s;ome malediction upon my di&s;obedience that <HI>neither</HI> of us, I mu&s;t own, could tran|quilly di&s;regard."</Q></P>
<P>This was an argument that came home to Cecilia, who&s;e deliberation upon it, though &s;ilent, was evidently not unfavourable.</P>
<P>He then told her that with re&s;pect to &s;et|tlements, he would in&s;tantly have a bond drawn up, &s;imilar to that prepared for their former intended union, which &s;hould be properly &s;igned and &s;ealed, and by which he would engage him&s;elf to make, upon coming to his e&s;tate, the &s;ame &s;ettlement upon her that was made upon his mother.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And as, in&s;tead of keeping up three hou&s;es,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"in the manner my father does at pre&s;ent, I mean to put my whole e&s;tate <HI>out to nur&s;e,</HI> while we re&s;ide for a while abroad, or in the country, I doubt not but in a very few years we &s;hall be as rich and as ea&s;y as we &s;hall de&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P>He told her, al&s;o, of his well-founded expectations from the Relations already mentioned; which the concurrence of his
<PB N="194" REF="193">
mother with his marriage would thence for|ward &s;ecure to him.</P>
<P>He then, with more coherence, &s;tated his plan at large. He purpo&s;ed, without lo&s;ing a moment, to return to London; he con|jured her, in the name of his mother, to &s;et out her&s;elf early the next day, that the following evening might be dedicated whol|ly to Mrs. Delvile: through her interce&s;|&s;ion he might then hope Cecilia's compli|ance, and every thing on the morning after &s;hould be prepared for their union. The long-de&s;ired ceremony over, he would in|&s;tantly ride po&s;t to his father, and pay him, at lea&s;t, the re&s;pect of being the fir&s;t to com|municate it. He would then attend his mother to the Continent, and leave the ar|rangement of every thing to his return. <Q REND="inline">"Still, therefore, as a &s;ingle man,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"I mean to make the journey, and I &s;hall take care, by the time I return, to have all things in readine&s;s for claiming my &s;weet Bride. Tell me, then, now, if you can rea&s;onably oppo&s;e this plan?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, after &s;ome he&s;i|tation, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch violent precipitancy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you not try me too much,"</Q> cried Delvile, impatiently, <Q REND="inline">"to talk <HI>now</HI> of pre|cipitancy! after &s;uch painful waiting, &s;uch
<PB N="195" REF="194">
weari&s;ome expectation! I a&s;k you not to involve your own affairs in confu&s;ion by accompanying me abroad; &s;weet to me as would be &s;uch an indulgence, I would not make a run-away of you in the opinion of the world. All I wi&s;h is the &s;ecret certainty I cannot be robbed of you, that no cruel machinations may again work our &s;epara|tion, that you are mine, unalterably mine, beyond the power of caprice or ill fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia made no an&s;wer; tortured with irre&s;olution, &s;he knew not upon what to de|termine.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We might then, according to the favour or di&s;plea&s;ure of my father, &s;ettle wholly abroad for the pre&s;ent, or occa&s;ionally vi&s;it him in England; my mother would be al|ways and openly our friend.&mdash;Oh be firm, then, I conjure you, to the promi&s;e you have given her, and deign to be mine on the conditions &s;he pre&s;cribes. She will be bound to you for ever by &s;o generous a conce&s;&s;ion, and even her health may be re&s;tored by the ce&s;&s;ation of her anxieties. With &s;uch a wife, &s;uch a mother, what will be wanting for <HI>me!</HI> Could I lament not being richer, I mu&s;t be rapacious indeed!&mdash;Speak, then, my Cecilia! relieve me from the agony of this eternal uncertainty, and tell me your word is invariable as your honour, and tell me my mother gives not her &s;anction in vain!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="195">
Cecilia &s;ighed deeply, but, after &s;ome he|&s;itation, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I little knew what I pro|mi&s;ed, nor know I now what to perform!&mdash;there mu&s;t ever, I find, be &s;ome check to human happine&s;s! yet, &s;ince upon the&s;e terms, Mrs. Delvile her&s;elf is content to wi&s;h me of her family&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;topt; but, urged earne&s;tly by Del|vile, added <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t not, I think, with|draw the powers with which I entru&s;ted her."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, grateful and enchanted, now forgot his ha&s;te and his bu&s;ine&s;s, and lo&s;t every wi&s;h but to re-animate her &s;pirits: &s;he compelled him, however, to leave her, that his vi&s;it might le&s;s be wondered at, and &s;ent by him a me&s;&s;age to Mrs. Delvile, that, wholly relying upon her wi&s;dom, &s;he impli|citly &s;ubmitted to her decree.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. AN ENTERPRISE.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA now had no time for after|thoughts or anxious repentance, &s;ince notwith&s;tanding the hurry of her &s;pirits, and the confu&s;ion of her mind, &s;he had too much real bu&s;ine&s;s, to yield to pen&s;ive indulgence.</P>
<P>Aver&s;e to all fal&s;ehood, &s;he invented none upon this occa&s;ion; &s;he merely told her gue&s;ts &s;he was &s;ummoned to London upon an affair of importance; and though &s;he &s;aw their curio&s;ity, not being at liberty to &s;atis|fy it with the truth, &s;he attempted not to appea&s;e it by fiction, but quietly left it to its common fare, conjecture. She would gladly have made Henrietta the companion of her journey, but Henrietta was the la&s;t to whom that journey could give plea&s;ure. She only, therefore, took her maid in the chai&s;e, and, attended by one &s;ervant on hor&s;eback, at &s;ix o'clock the next morning, &s;he quitted her man&s;ion, to enter into an engagement by which &s;oon &s;he was to re|&s;ign it for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="197">
Di&s;intere&s;ted as &s;he was, &s;he con&s;idered her &s;ituation as peculiarly perver&s;e, that from the time of her coming to a fortune which mo&s;t others regarded as enviable, &s;he had been a &s;tranger to peace, a fruitle&s;s &s;eeker of happine&s;s, a dupe to the fraudu|lent, and a prey to the needy! the little comfort &s;he had received, had been merely from di&s;pen&s;ing it, and now only had &s;he any chance of being happy her&s;elf, when upon the point of relinqui&s;hing what all others built their happine&s;s upon ob|taining!</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections only gave way to others &s;till more di&s;agreeable; &s;he was now a &s;e|cond time engaged in a tran&s;action &s;he could not approve, and &s;uffering the whole peace of her future life to hang upon an action dark, private and imprudent: an action by which the liberal kindne&s;s of her late uncle would be annulled, by which the father of her intended hu&s;band would be di&s;obeyed, and which already, in a &s;imilar in&s;tance, had brought her to affliction and di&s;grace. The&s;e melancholy thoughts haunted her during the whole journey, and though the a&s;&s;urance of Mrs. Delvile's ap|probation was &s;ome relief to her unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he involuntarily prepared her&s;elf for meet|ing new mortifications, and was tormented
<PB N="199" REF="198">
with an apprehen&s;ion that this &s;econd at|tempt made her merit them.</P>
<P>She drove immediately, by the previous direction of Delvile, to a lodging-hou&s;e in Albemarle-Street, which he had taken care to have prepared for her reception. She then &s;ent for a chair, and went to Mrs. Delvile's. Her being &s;een by the &s;ervants of that hou&s;e was not very important, as their ma&s;ter was &s;oon to be acquainted with the real motive of her journey.</P>
<P>She was &s;hewn into a parlour, while Mrs. Delvile was informed of her arrival, and there flown to by Delvile with the mo&s;t grateful eagerne&s;s. Yet &s;he &s;aw in his countenance that all was not well, and heard upon enquiry that his mother was con|&s;iderably wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Extremely &s;hocked by this intelligence, &s;he already began to lament her unfortu|nate enterpri&s;e. Delvile &s;truggled, by ex|erting his own &s;pirits, to re&s;tore her's, but forced gaiety is never exhilarating; and, full of care and anxiety, he was ill able to appear &s;prightly and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon &s;ummoned up &s;tairs into the apartment of Mrs. Delvile, who was lying upon a couch, pale, weak, and much altered. Delvile led the way, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Here, madam, comes one who&s;e &s;ight will bring peace and plea&s;ure to you!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="199">
<Q REND="inline">"This, indeed,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, half ri&s;ing and embracing her, <Q REND="inline">"is the form in which they are mo&s;t welcome to me! virtuous, noble Cecilia! what honour you do my &s;on! with what joy, &s;hould I ever recover, &s;hall I a&s;&s;i&s;t him in paying the gratitude he owes you!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, grieved at her &s;ituation, and af|fected by her kindne&s;s, could only an&s;wer with her tears; which, however, were not &s;hed alone; for Devile's eyes were full, as he pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"This, this is the &s;ight my heart has thus long de&s;ired! the wife of my choice taken to the bo&s;om of the parent I revere! be yet but well, my beloved mother, and I will be thankful for every calamity that has led to &s;o &s;weet a conclu&s;ion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Content your&s;elf, however, my &s;on, with one of us,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, &s;miling; <Q REND="inline">"and content your&s;elf, if you can, though your hard lot &s;hould make that one this crea|ture of full bloom, health, and youth!

<P><PB N="201" REF="200">
This was not a &s;peech to &s;top the tears of Cecilia, though &s;uch warmth of appro|bation quieted her con&s;cientious &s;cruples.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is this the ingenuity of duty or of love? and which are you ju&s;t now thinking of, my health, or a conver&s;ation uninterrupted with Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps a little of both!"</Q> &s;aid he, chearfully, though colouring.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you rather meant it &s;hould pa&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"you were thinking only of me? I have always ob&s;erved, that where one &s;cheme an&s;wers two purpo&s;es, the o&s;ten&s;ive is never the purpo&s;e mo&s;t at heart."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why it is but common prudence,"</Q> an&s;wered Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"to feel our way a little
<PB N="202" REF="201">
before we mention what we mo&s;t wi&s;h, and &s;o ca&s;t the hazard of the refu&s;al upon &s;ome|thing rather le&s;s important."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Admirably &s;ettled!"</Q> cried Mrs. Del|vile: <Q REND="inline">"&s;o my re&s;t is but to prove Mi&s;s Beverley's di&s;turbance!&mdash;Well, it is only anticipating our future way of life, when her di&s;turbance, in taking the management of you to her&s;elf, will of cour&s;e prove my re&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>She then quietly repo&s;ed her&s;elf, and Delvile di&s;cour&s;ed with Cecilia upon their future plans, hopes and actions.</P>
<P>He meant to &s;et off from the church|door to Delvile Ca&s;tle, to acquaint his fa|ther with his marriage, and then to return in&s;tantly to London: there he entreated Cecilia to &s;tay with his mother, that, find|ing them both together, he might not ex|hau&s;t her patience, by making his parting vi&s;it occa&s;ion another journey to Suffolk.</P>
<P>But here Cecilia re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed him; &s;aying, her only chance to e&s;cape di&s;covery, was going in&s;tantly to her own hou&s;e; and repre&s;enting &s;o earne&s;tly her de&s;ire that their marriage &s;hould be unknown till his return to England, upon a thou&s;and motives of delicacy, propriety, and fearfulne&s;s, that the obligation he owed already to a com|pliance which he &s;aw grew more and more re|luctant, re&s;trained him both in gratitude and
<PB N="203" REF="202">
pity from per&s;ecuting her further. Neither would &s;he con&s;ent to &s;eeing him in Suffolk; which could but delay his mother's journey, and expo&s;e her to unnece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;picions; &s;he promi&s;ed, however, to write to him often, and as, from his mother's weakne&s;s, he mu&s;t travel very &s;lowly, &s;he took a plan of his route, and engaged that he &s;hould find a letter from her at every great town.</P>
<P>The bond which he had already had al|tered, he in&s;i&s;ted upon leaving in her own cu&s;tody, aver&s;e to applying to Mr. Monck|ton, who&s;e behaviour to him had before given him di&s;gu&s;t, and in whom Cecilia her&s;elf no longer wi&s;hed to confide. He had again applied to the &s;ame lawyer, Mr. Singleton, to give her away; for though to his &s;ecrecy he had no tie, he had &s;till le&s;s to any entire &s;tranger. Mrs. Delvile was too ill to attend them to church, nor would Delvile have de&s;ired from her &s;uch ab&s;olute defiance of his father.</P>
<P>Cecilia now gave another &s;igh to her de|parted friend Mrs. Charlton, who&s;e pre|&s;ence upon this awful occa&s;ion would el&s;e again have &s;oothed and &s;upported her. She had no female friend in whom &s;he could rely; but feeling a repugnance in|vincible to being accompanied only by men, &s;he accepted the attendance of Mrs. Delvile's own woman, who had lived many
<PB N="204" REF="203">
years in the family, and was high in the favour and confidence of her lady.</P>
<P>The arrangement of the&s;e and other ar|ticles, with occa&s;ional interruptions from Mrs. Delvile, fully employed the evening. Delvile would not tru&s;t again to meeting her at the church; but begged her to &s;end out her &s;ervants between &s;even and eight o'clock in the morning, at which time he would him&s;elf call for her with a chair.</P>
<P>She went away early, that Mrs. Delvile might go to re&s;t, and it was mutually agreed they &s;hould ri&s;k no meeting the next day. Delvile conjured them to part with firmne&s;s and chearfulne&s;s, and Cecilia, fearing her own emotion, would have re|tired without bidding her adieu. But Mrs. Delvile, calling after her, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Take with you my ble&s;&s;ing!"</Q> and tenderly em|bracing her, added, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, as my chief nur&s;e, claims a pre&s;criptive right to govern me, but I will break from his control to tell my &s;weet Cecilia what ea&s;e and what delight &s;he has already given to my mind! my be&s;t hope of recovery is founded on the plea&s;ure I anticipate in witne&s;&s;ing your mutual happine&s;s: but &s;hould my illne&s;s prove fatal, and that felicity be denied me, my greate&s;t earthly care is already removed by the &s;ecurity I feel of Mortimer's future peace. Take with you, then, my ble&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="205" REF="204">
for you are become one to me! long daughter of my affection, now wife of my darling &s;on! love her, Mortimer, as &s;he merits, and cheri&s;h her with tendere&s;t gra|titude!&mdash;bani&s;h, &s;weete&s;t Cecilia, every ap|prehen&s;ion that oppre&s;&s;es you, and receive in Mortimer Delvile a hu&s;band that will re|vere your virtues, and dignify your choice!"</Q></P>
<P>She then embraced her again, and &s;eeing that her heart was too full for &s;peech, &s;uf|fered her to go without making any an&s;wer. Delvile attended her to her chair, &s;carce le&s;s moved than her&s;elf, and found only opportunity to entreat her punctuality the next morning.</P>
<P>She had, indeed, no inclination to fail in her appointment, or ri&s;k the repetition of &s;cenes &s;o affecting, or &s;ituations &s;o alarm|ing. Mrs. Delvile's full approbation &s;ome|what re&s;tored to her her own, but nothing could remove the fearful anxiety, which &s;till privately tormented her with expecta|tions of another di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he aro&s;e with the light, and calling all her courage to her aid, determined to con&s;ider this day as de|ci&s;ive of her de&s;tiny with regard to Delvile, and, rejoicing that at lea&s;t all &s;u&s;pen&s;e would be over, to &s;upport her&s;elf with fortitude, be that de&s;tiny what it might.</P>
<P>At the appointed time &s;he &s;ent her maid
<PB N="206" REF="205">
to vi&s;it Mrs. Hill, and gave &s;ome errands to her man that carried him to a di&s;tant part of the town: but &s;he charged them both to return to the lodgings by nine o'clock, at which hour &s;he ordered a chai&s;e for returning into the country.</P>
<P>Delvile, who was impatiently watching for their quitting the hou&s;e, only waited till they were out of &s;ight, to pre&s;ent him&s;elf at the door. He was &s;hewn into a parlour, where &s;he in&s;tantly attended him; and being told that the clergyman, Mr. Single|ton, and Mrs. Delvile's woman, were al|ready in the church, &s;he gave him her hand in &s;ilence, and he led her to the chair.</P>
<P>The calmne&s;s of &s;tifled hope had now taken place in Cecilia of quick &s;en&s;ations and alarm. Occupied with a firm belief &s;he &s;hould never be the wife of Delvile, &s;he only waited, with a de&s;perate &s;ort of patience, to &s;ee when and by whom &s;he was next to be parted from him.</P>
<P>When they arrived near the church, Del|vile &s;topt the chair. He handed Cecilia out of it, and di&s;charging the chairmen, conducted her into the church. He was &s;urpri&s;ed him&s;elf at her compo&s;ure, but earne&s;tly wi&s;hing it to la&s;t, took care not to &s;ay to her a word that &s;hould make any an&s;wer from her nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>He gave her, as before, to Mr. Singleton,
<PB N="207" REF="206">
&s;ecretly praying that not, as before, &s;he might be given him in vain: Mrs. Delvile's woman attended her; the clergy|man was ready, and they all proceeded to the altar.</P>
<P>The ceremony was begun; Cecilia, ra|ther mechanically than with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, appearing to li&s;ten to it: but at the words, <HI>If any man can &s;hew any ju&s;t cau&s;e why they may not lawfully be joined together,</HI> Delvile him&s;elf &s;hook with terror, le&s;t &s;ome con|cealed per&s;on &s;hould again an&s;wer it, and Cecilia, with a &s;ort of &s;teady di&s;may in her countenance, ca&s;t her eyes round the church, with no other view than that of &s;eeing from what corner the prohibiter would &s;tart.</P>
<P>She looked, however, to no purpo&s;e; no prohibiter appeared, the ceremony was performed without any interruption, and &s;he received the thanks of Delvile, and the congratulations of the little &s;et, before the idea which had &s;o &s;trongly pre-occupied her imagination, was &s;ufficiently removed from it to &s;atisfy her &s;he was really married.</P>
<P>They then went to the ve&s;try, where their bu&s;ine&s;s was not long; and Delvile again put Cecilia into a chair, which again he accompanied on foot.</P>
<P>Her &s;en&s;ibility now &s;oon returned, though &s;till attended with &s;trangene&s;s and a &s;en&s;ation
<PB N="208" REF="207">
of incredulity. But the &s;ight of Del|vile at her lodgings, contrary to their agreement, wholly recovered her &s;en&s;es from the &s;tupor which had dulled them. He came, however, but to acknowledge how highly &s;he had obliged him, to &s;ee her him&s;elf re&s;tored to the animation natural to her character, and to give her a million of charges, re&s;ulting from anxiety and ten|derne&s;s. And then, fearing the return of her &s;ervants, he quitted her, and &s;et out for Delvile Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The amazement of Cecilia was &s;till un|conquerable; to be actually united with Delvile! to be his with the full con&s;ent of his mother,&mdash;to have him her's, beyond the power of his father,&mdash;&s;he could not reconcile it with po&s;&s;ibility; &s;he fancied it a dream,&mdash;but a dream from which &s;he wi&s;hed not to awake.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. A DISCOVERY.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA's journey back to the coun|try was as &s;afe and free from interrup|tion as her journey had been to town, and all that di&s;tingui&s;hed them was what pa&s;&s;ed in her own mind: the doubts, apprehen|&s;ions, and de&s;ponding &s;u&s;pen&s;e which had accompanied her &s;etting out, were now all removed, and certainty, ea&s;e, the expectation of happine&s;s, and the ce&s;&s;ation of all per|plexity, had taken their place. She had nothing left to dread but the inflexibi|lity of Mr. Delvile, and hardly any thing even to hope but the recovery of his lady.</P>
<P>Her friends at her return expre&s;&s;ed their wonder at her expedition, but their wonder at what occa&s;ioned it, though &s;till greater, met no &s;atisfaction. Henrietta rejoiced in her &s;ight, though her ab&s;ence had been &s;o
<PB N="210" REF="209">
&s;hort; and Cecilia, who&s;e affection with her pity increa&s;ed, intimated to her the event for which &s;he wi&s;hed her to prepare her|&s;elf, and frankly acknowledged &s;he had rea&s;on to expect it would &s;oon take place.</P>
<P>Henrietta endeavoured with compo&s;ure to receive this intelligence, and to return &s;uch a mark of confidence with chearful congratulations: but her fortitude was un|equal to an effort &s;o heroic, and her cha|racter was too &s;imple to a&s;&s;ume a greatne&s;s &s;he felt not: &s;he &s;ighed and changed co|lour; and ha&s;tily quitted the room that &s;he might &s;ob aloud in another.</P>
<P>Warm-hearted, tender, and &s;u&s;ceptible, her affections were all undi&s;gui&s;ed: &s;truck with the elegance of Delvile, and enchanted by his &s;ervices to her brother, &s;he had lo&s;t to him her heart at fir&s;t without mi&s;&s;ing it, and, when mi&s;&s;ed, without &s;eeking to re|claim it. The hopele&s;sne&s;s of &s;uch a pa&s;|&s;ion &s;he never con&s;idered, nor a&s;ked her&s;elf its end, or &s;carce &s;u&s;pected its aim; it was plea&s;ant to her at the time, and &s;he looked not to the future, but fed it with vi&s;ionary &s;chemes, and &s;oothed it with voluntary fancies. Now &s;he knew all was over, &s;he felt the folly &s;he had committed, but though &s;en&s;ibly and candidly angry at her own er|ror, its conviction offered nothing but &s;orrow to &s;ucceed it.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="210">
The felicity of Cecilia, whom &s;he loved, admired and revered, &s;he wi&s;hed with the genuine ardour of zealous &s;incerity; but that Delvile, the very cau&s;e and &s;ole &s;ubject of her own per&s;onal unhappine&s;s, &s;hould him&s;elf con&s;titute that felicity, was too much for her &s;pirits, and &s;eemed to her mortified mind too cruel in her de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who in the very vehemence of her &s;orrow &s;aw its innocence, was too ju&s;t and too noble to be offended by it, or im|pute to the bad pa&s;&s;ions of envy or jealou&s;y, the artle&s;s regret of an untutored mind. To be penetrated too deeply with the merit of Delvile, with her wanted no excu&s;e, and &s;he grieved for her &s;ituation with but little mixture of blame, and none of &s;urpri&s;e. She redoubled her kindne&s;s and care&s;&s;es with the hope of con&s;oling her, but ventured to tru&s;t her no further, till reflection, and her natu|ral good &s;en&s;e, &s;hould better enable her to bear an explanation.</P>
<P>Nor was this friendly exertion any longer a hard&s;hip to her; the &s;udden removal, in her own feelings and affairs, of di&s;tre&s;s and expectation, had now &s;o much lightened her heart, that &s;he could &s;pare without repin|ing, &s;ome portion of its &s;pirit to her dejec|ted young friend.</P>
<P>But an incident happened two mornings after which called back, and mo&s;t unplea&s;antly,
<PB N="212" REF="211">
her attention to her&s;elf. She was told that Mrs. Matt, the poor woman &s;he had &s;ettled in Bury, begged an audience, and upon &s;ending for her up &s;tairs, and de&s;iring to know what &s;he could do for her, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing, madam, ju&s;t now,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"for I don't come upon my own bu&s;ine&s;s, but to tell &s;ome news to you, ma|dam. You bid me never take notice of the wedding, that was to be, and I'm &s;ure I never opened my mouth about it from that time to this; but I have found out who it was put a &s;top to it, and &s;o I come to tell you."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely amazed, eagerly de|&s;ired her to go on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, madam, I don't know the gen|tlewoman's name quite right yet, but I can tell you where &s;he lives, for I knew her as &s;oon as I &s;et eyes on her, when I &s;ee her at church la&s;t Sunday, and I would have fol|lowed her home, but &s;he went into a coach, and I could not walk fa&s;t enough; but I a&s;ked one of the footmen where &s;he lived, and he &s;aid at the great hou&s;e at the Grove: and perhaps, madam, you may know where that is: and then he told me her name, but that I can't ju&s;t now think of."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven!"</Q> cried Cecilia,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"it could not be Bennet?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, ma'am, that's the very name; I know it again now I hear it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="212">
Cecilia then ha&s;tily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, fir&s;t de&s;iring her not to mention the circum|&s;tance to any body.</P>
<P>Shocked and di&s;mayed, &s;he now &s;aw, but &s;aw with horror, the removal of all her doubts, and the explanation of all her diffi|culties, in the full and irrefragable di&s;co|very of the perfidy of her olde&s;t friend and confident.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bennet her&s;elf &s;he regarded in the affair as a mere tool, which, though in effect it did the work, was innocent of its mi&s;|chief, becau&s;e powerle&s;s but in the hand of its employer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That employer,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t be Mr. Monckton! Mr. Monckton whom &s;o long I have known, who &s;o willingly has been my coun&s;ellor, &s;o ably my in&s;tructor! in who&s;e integrity I have confided, upon who&s;e friend&s;hip I have relied! my &s;uccour in all emergencies, my guide in all per|plexities!&mdash;Mr. <HI>Monckton</HI> thus di&s;ho|nourably, thus barbarou&s;ly to betray me! to turn again&s;t me the very confidence I had repo&s;ed in his regard for me! and make u&s;e of my own tru&s;t to furni&s;h the means to injure me!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>She was now wholly confirmed that he had wronged her with Mr. Delvile; &s;he could not have two enemies &s;o malignant without provocation, and he who &s;o unfeel|ingly could di&s;&s;olve a union at the very
<PB N="214" REF="213">
altar, could alone have the ba&s;ene&s;s to ca|lumniate her &s;o cruelly.</P>
<P>Evil thoughts thus awakened, &s;topt not merely upon facts; conjecture carried her further, and conjecture built upon probabi|lity. The officiou&s;ne&s;s of Morrice in pur|&s;uing her to London, his vi&s;iting her when there, and his following and watching Del|vile, &s;he now rea&s;onably concluded were actions directed by Mr. Monckton, who&s;e hou&s;e he had but ju&s;t left, and who&s;e orders, whatever they might be, &s;he was almo&s;t certain he would obey. Availing him&s;elf, therefore, of the forwardne&s;s and &s;upple|ne&s;s which met in this young man, &s;he doubted not but his intelligence had con|tributed to acquaint him with her proceed|ings.</P>
<P>The motivof &s;uch deep concerted and accummulated treachery was next to be &s;ought: nor was the &s;earch long; one only could have tempted him to &s;chemes &s;o ha|zardous and co&s;tly; and, un&s;u&s;picious as &s;he was, &s;he now &s;aw into his whole de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Long accu&s;tomed to regard him as a &s;afe and di&s;intere&s;ted old friend, the re&s;pect with which, as a child, &s;he had looked up to him, &s;he had in&s;en&s;ibly pre&s;erved when a woman. That re&s;pect had taught her to con&s;ider his notice as a favour, and far from &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly &s;hunning, &s;he had innocently courted it:
<PB N="215" REF="214">
and his readine&s;s in advi&s;ing and tutoring her, his frank and ea&s;y friendline&s;s of beha|viour, had kept his influence unimpaired, by preventing its &s;ecret purpo&s;e from being detected.</P>
<P>But now the whole my&s;tery was revealed; his aver&s;ion to the Delviles, to which hi|therto &s;he had attributed all &s;he di&s;approv|ed in his behaviour, &s;he was convinced mu&s;t be inadequate to &s;timulate him to &s;uch lengths. That aver&s;ion it&s;elf was by this late &s;urmi&s;e accounted for, and no &s;ooner did it occur to her, than a thou&s;and cir|cum&s;tances confirmed it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t among the&s;e was the evident ill will of Lady Margaret, which though &s;he had con&s;tantly imputed to the general ira&s;ci|bility for which her character was notori|ous, &s;he had often wondered to find impe|netrable to all endeavours to plea&s;e or &s;of|ten her. His care of her fortune, his ex|hortations again&s;t her expences, his wi&s;h to make her live with Mr. Briggs, all contri|buted to point out the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of his at|tentions, which in one in&s;tance rendered vi&s;ible, became obvious in every other.</P>
<P>Yet various as were the incidents that now poured upon her memory to his di&s;|grace, not one among them took its ri&s;e from his behaviour to her&s;elf, which always had been &s;crupulou&s;ly circum&s;pect, or if for
<PB N="216" REF="215">
a moment unguarded, only at a &s;ea&s;on when her own di&s;tre&s;s or confu&s;ion had prevented her from perceiving it. This recollection almo&s;t &s;taggered her &s;u&s;picions; yet &s;o ab|&s;olute &s;eemed the confirmation they receiv|ed from every other, that her doubt was overpowered, and &s;oon wholly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>She was yet ruminating upon this &s;ub|ject, when word was brought her that Mr. Monckton was in the parlour.</P>
<P>Mingled di&s;gu&s;t and indignation made her &s;hudder at his name, and without pau&s;|ing a moment, &s;he &s;ent him word &s;he was engaged, and could not po&s;&s;ibly leave her room.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed by &s;uch a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he left the hou&s;e in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. But Cecilia could not endure to &s;ee him, after a di&s;covery of &s;uch hypocri&s;y and villainy.</P>
<P>She con&s;idered, however, that the matter could not re&s;t here: he would demand an explanation, and perhaps, by his unparal|leled addre&s;s, again contrive to &s;eem inno|cent, notwith&s;tanding appearances were at pre&s;ent &s;o much again&s;t him. Expecting, therefore, &s;ome artifice, and determined not to be duped by it, &s;he &s;ent again for the Pew-opener, to examine her more &s;trictly.</P>
<P>The woman was out at work in a private family, and could not come till the even|ing: but, when further que&s;tioned, the de&s;cription
<PB N="217" REF="216">
&s;he gave of Mi&s;s Bennet was too exact to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired her to call again the next morning: and &s;ent a &s;ervant to the Grove, with her compliments to Mi&s;s Bennet, and a reque&s;t that &s;he might &s;end her carriage for her the next day, at any time &s;he plea&s;ed, as &s;he wi&s;hed much to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age, &s;he was aware, might create &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, and put her upon her guard; but &s;he thought, neverthele&s;s, a &s;udden meeting with the Pew-opener, whom &s;he meant abruptly to confront with her, would baffle the &s;ecurity of any previou&s;ly &s;ettled &s;cheme.</P>
<P>To a conviction &s;uch as this even Mr. Monckton mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and &s;ince he was lo&s;t to her as a friend, &s;he might at lea&s;t &s;ave her&s;elf the pain of keeping up his ac|quaintance.</P>

<P>THE &s;ervant did not return till it was dark; and then, with a look of much di&s;may, &s;aid he had been able to meet with nobody who could either give or take a me&s;&s;age; that the Grove was all in confu|&s;ion, and the whole country in an uproar, for Mr. Monckton, ju&s;t as he arrived, had been brought home dead!</P>
<P>Cecilia &s;creamed with involuntary hor|ror; a pang like remor&s;e &s;eized her mind, with the apprehen&s;ion &s;he had &s;ome &s;hare in this cata&s;trophe, and innocent as &s;he was either of his fall or his crimes, &s;he no &s;ooner heard he was no more, than &s;he for|got he had offended her, and reproached her&s;elf with &s;everity for the &s;hame to which &s;he meant to expo&s;e him the next morning.</P>
<P>Dreadfully di&s;turbed by this horrible in|cident, &s;he entreated Mrs. Harrel and Hen|rietta to &s;up by them&s;elves, and going into her own room, determined to write the whole affair to Delvile, in a letter &s;he &s;hould direct to be left at the po&s;t-office for him at Margate.</P>

<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My CECILIA!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Be alone, I conjure you; di&s;mi&s;s every body, and admit me this moment!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Great was her a&s;toni&s;hment at this note! no name to it, no conclu&s;ion, the cha|racters indi&s;tinct, the writing crooked, the words &s;o few, and tho&s;e few &s;carce legible!</P>
<P>He de&s;ired to &s;ee her, and to &s;ee her alone; &s;he could not he&s;itate in her com|pliance,&mdash;but whom could &s;he di&s;mi&s;s?&mdash;her &s;ervants, if ordered away, would but be curiou&s;ly upon the watch,&mdash;&s;he could think
<PB N="220" REF="219">
of no expedient, &s;he was all hurry and amazement.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked if any one waited for an an|&s;wer? The footman &s;aid no; that the note was given in by &s;omebody who did not &s;peak, and who ran out of &s;ight the mo|ment he had delivered it.</P>
<P>She could not doubt this was Delvile him&s;elf,&mdash;Delvile who &s;hould now be ju&s;t returned from the ca&s;tle to his mother, and whom &s;he had thought not even a letter would reach if directed any where nearer than Margate!</P>
<P>All &s;he could devi&s;e in obedience to him, was to go and wait for him alone in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, giving orders that if any one called they might be immediately brought up to her, as &s;he expected &s;omebody upon bu&s;ine&s;s, with whom &s;he mu&s;t not be in|terrupted.</P>
<P>This was extremely di&s;agreeable to her; yet, contrary as it was to their agreement, &s;he felt no inclination to reproach Delvile; the abruptne&s;s of his note, the evident hand-&s;haking with which it had been writ|ten, the &s;trangene&s;s of the reque&s;t in a &s;itu|ation &s;uch as theirs,&mdash;all concurred to a&s;|&s;ure her he came not to her idly, and all led her to apprehend he came to her with evil tidings.</P>
<P>What they might be, &s;he had no time to
<PB N="221" REF="220">
conjecture; a &s;ervant, in a few minutes, opened the dre&s;&s;ing-room door, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ma'am, a gentleman;"</Q> and Delvile, abruptly entering, &s;hut it him&s;elf, in his eagerne&s;s to get rid of him.</P>
<P>At his &s;ight, her progno&s;tication of ill became &s;tronger! &s;he went forward to meet him, and he advanced to her &s;miling and in ha&s;te; but that &s;mile did not well do its office; it concealed not a pallid counte|nance, in which every feature &s;poke horror; it di&s;gui&s;ed not an aching heart, which al|mo&s;t vi&s;ibly throbbed with intolerable emo|tion! Yet he addre&s;&s;ed her in terms of ten|derne&s;s and peace; but his tremulous voice counteracted his words, and &s;poke that all within was tumult and war!</P>
<P>Cecilia, amazed, affrighted, had no pow|er to ha&s;ten an explanation, which, on his own part, he &s;eemed unable, or fearful to begin. He talked to her of his happine&s;s in again &s;eeing her before he left the king|dom, entreated her to write to him conti|nually, &s;aid the &s;ame thing two and three times in a breath, began with one &s;ubject, and &s;eemed uncon&s;cious he wandered pre|&s;ently into another, and a&s;ked her que&s;tions innumerable about her health, journey, affairs, and ea&s;e of mind, without hearing from her any an&s;wer, or &s;eeming to mi&s;s that &s;he made none.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="221">
Cecilia grew dreadfully terrified; &s;ome|thing &s;trange and mo&s;t alarming &s;he was &s;ure mu&s;t have happened, but <HI>what,</HI> &s;he had no means to know, nor courage, nor even words to enquire.</P>
<P>Delvile, at length, the fir&s;t hurry of his &s;pirits abating, became more coherent and con&s;iderate: and looking anxiou&s;ly at her, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why this &s;ilence, my Cecilia?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, endeavouring to recover her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"but your coming was unexpected: I was ju&s;t writing to you at Margate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Write &s;till, then; but direct to O&s;|tend; I &s;hall be quicker than the po&s;t; and I would not lo&s;e a letter&mdash;a line&mdash;a word from you, for all the world can offer me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Quicker than the po&s;t?"</Q> cried Ceci|lia; <Q REND="inline">"but how can Mrs. Delvile&mdash;"</Q> &s;he &s;topt; not knowing what &s;he might ven|ture to a&s;k.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She is now on the road to Margate; I hope to be there to receive her. I mean but to bid you adieu, and be gone."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia made no an&s;wer; &s;he was more and more a&s;toni&s;hed, more and more con|founded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are thoughtful?"</Q> &s;aid he, with tenderne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"are you unhappy?&mdash;&s;weete&s;t Cecilia! mo&s;t excellent of human creatures! if I have made you unhappy&mdash;and I mu&s;t!&mdash;it is inevitable!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="222">
<Q REND="inline">"Oh Delvile!"</Q> cried &s;he, now a&s;&s;uming more courage, <Q REND="inline">"why will you not &s;peak to me openly?&mdash;&s;omething, I &s;ee, is wrong; may I not hear it? may I not tell you, at lea&s;t, my concern that any thing has di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are too good!"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"to de&s;erve you is not po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;but to afflict you is inhuman!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o?"</Q> cried &s;he, more chearful|ly; <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t I not &s;hare the common lot? or expect the whole world to be new mo|delled, le&s;t I &s;hould meet in it any thing but happine&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is not, indeed, much danger! Have you pen and ink here?"</Q></P>
<P>She brought them to him immediately, with paper.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have been writing to me, you &s;ay?&mdash;I will begin a letter my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To me?"</Q> cried &s;he.</P>
<P>He made no an&s;wer, but took up the pen, and wrote a few words, and then, flinging it down, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Fool!&mdash;I could have done this without coming!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May I look at it?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; and, finding he made no oppo&s;ition, advanced and read.</P>
<P><HI>I fear to alarm you by ra&s;h precipitation,&mdash;I fear to alarm you by lingering &s;u&s;pen&s;e,&mdash;but all is not well&mdash;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="223">
<Q REND="inline">"Fear nothing!"</Q> cried &s;he, turning to him with the kinde&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"tell me, whatever it may be!&mdash;Am I not your wife? bound by every tie divine and human to &s;hare in all your &s;orrows, if, unhappily, I cannot mitigate them!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Since you allow me,"</Q> cried he, grate|fully, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o &s;weet a claim, a claim to which all others yield, and which if you repent not giving me, will make all others nearly im|material to me,&mdash;I will own to you that all, indeed, is not well! I have been ha&s;ty,&mdash;you will blame me; I de&s;erve, indeed, to be blamed!&mdash;entru&s;ted with your peace and happine&s;s, to &s;uffer rage, re&s;entment, vio|lence, to make me forego what I owed to &s;uch a depo&s;ite!&mdash;If your blame, however, &s;tops &s;hort of repentance&mdash;but it cannot!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then,"</Q> cried &s;he with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t you have done? for there is not an action of which I believe you capable, there is not an event which I believe to be po&s;|&s;ible, that can ever make me repent be|longing to you wholly!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Generous, conde&s;cending Cecilia!"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"Words &s;uch as the&s;e, hung there not upon me an evil the mo&s;t depre&s;|&s;ing, would be almo&s;t more than I could bear&mdash;would make me too ble&s;t for mor|tality!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But words &s;uch as the&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he
<PB N="225" REF="224">
more gaily, <Q REND="inline">"I might long have coquetted|ere I had &s;poken, had you not drawn them from me by this alarm. Take, therefore, the good with the ill, and remember, if all does not go right, you have now a tru&s;ty friend, as willing to be the partner of your &s;erious as your happie&s;t hours."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shew but as much firmne&s;s as you have &s;hewn &s;weetne&s;s,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"and I will fear to tell you nothing."</Q></P>
<P>She reiterated her a&s;&s;urances; they then both &s;at down, and he began his account.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Immediately from your lodgings I went where I had ordered a chai&s;e, and &s;topt only to change hor&s;es till I reached Delvile Ca&s;tle. My father &s;aw me with &s;urpri&s;e, and received me with coldne&s;s. I was compelled by my &s;ituation to be abrupt, and told him I came, before I accompanied my mother abroad, to make him acquaint|ed with an affair which I thought my&s;elf bound in duty and re&s;pect to &s;uffer no one to communicate to him but my&s;elf. He then &s;ternly interrupted me, and declared in high terms, that if this affair concerned <HI>you,</HI> he would not li&s;ten to it. I attempted to remon&s;trate upon this inju&s;tice, when he pa&s;&s;ionately broke forth into new and hor|rible charges again&s;t you, affirming that he had them from authority as indi&s;putable as
<PB N="226" REF="225">
ocular demon&s;tration. I was then certain of &s;ome foul play."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Foul play indeed!"</Q> cried Cecilia, who now knew but too well by whom &s;he had been injured. <Q REND="inline">"Good heaven, how have I been deceived, where mo&s;t I have tru&s;ted!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I told him,"</Q> continued Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome gro&s;s impo&s;ition had been practiced upon him, and earne&s;tly conjured him no longer to conceal from me by whom. This, un|fortunately, encrea&s;ed his rage; impo&s;i|tion, he &s;aid, was not &s;o ea&s;ily played upon him, he left that for <HI>me</HI> who &s;o readily was duped; while for him&s;elf, he had only given credit to a man of much con&s;ideration in Suffolk, who had known you from a child, who had &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured him he had re|peatedly endeavoured to reclaim you, who had re&s;cued you from the hands of Jews at his own hazard and lo&s;s, and who actually &s;hewed him bonds acknowledging immen&s;e debts, which were &s;igned with your own hand."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Horrible!"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I be|lieved not &s;uch guilt and perfidy po&s;&s;ible!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was &s;carce my&s;elf,"</Q> re&s;umed Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"while I heard him: I demanded even with fiercene&s;s his author, whom I &s;crupled not to execrate as he de&s;erved; he coldly an&s;wered he was bound by an oath never to reveal him, nor &s;hould he repay his honourable
<PB N="227" REF="226">
attention to his family by a breach of his own word, were it even le&s;s formally engaged. I then lo&s;t all patience; to men|tion honour, I cried, was a farce, where &s;uch infamous calumnies were li&s;tened to;&mdash;but let me not &s;hock you unnece&s;&s;arily, you may readily conjecture what pa&s;&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah me!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you have then quarrelled with your father!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have!"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"nor does he yet know I am married: in &s;o much wrath there was no room for narration; I only pledged my&s;elf by all I held &s;acred, never to re&s;t till I had cleared your fame, by the detection of this villainy, and then left him without further explanation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh return, then, to him directly!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"he is your father, you are bound to bear with his di&s;plea&s;ure;&mdash;alas! had you never known me, you had never incurred it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Believe me,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I am ill at ea&s;e under it: if you wi&s;h it, when you have heard me, I will go to him immedi|ately; if not, I will write, and you &s;hall your&s;elf dictate what."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him, and begged he would continue his account.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My fir&s;t &s;tep, when I left the Ca&s;tle, was to &s;end a letter to my mother, in which I entreated her to &s;et out as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="228" REF="227">
for Margate, as I was detained from her unavoidably, and was unwilling my delay &s;hould either retard our journey, or oblige her to travel fa&s;ter. At Margate I hoped to be as &s;oon as her&s;elf, if not before her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"did you not go to town as you had promi&s;ed, and accompany her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had bu&s;ine&s;s another way. I came hither."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Directly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No;&mdash;but &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where did you go fir&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Cecilia, it is now you mu&s;t &s;um|mon your fortitude: I left my father with|out an explanation on <HI>my</HI> part;&mdash;but not till, in his rage of a&s;&s;erting his authority, he had unwarily named his informant."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That informant&mdash;the mo&s;t deceitful of men!&mdash;was your long pretended friend, Mr. Monckton!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So I feared!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who&s;e blood now ran cold through her veins with &s;udden and new apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I rode to the Grove, on hack-hor&s;es, and on a full gallop the whole way. I got to him early in the evening. I was &s;hewn into his library. I told him my errand.&mdash;You look pale, my love? You are not well?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="228">
Cecilia, too &s;ick for &s;peech, leant he head upon a table. Delvile was going to call for help; but &s;he put her hand upon his arm to &s;top him, and, perceiving &s;he was only mentally affected, he re&s;ted, and endeavoured by every po&s;&s;ible means to re|vive her.</P>
<P>After a while, &s;he again rai&s;ed her head, faintly &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry I interrupted you; but the conclu&s;ion I already know,&mdash;Mr. Monckton is dead!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not dead,"</Q> cried he;" <Q REND="inline">"dangerou&s;ly, indeed, wounded, but thank heaven, not actually dead!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not dead?"</Q> cried Cecilia, with re|cruited &s;trength and &s;pirits, <Q REND="inline">"Oh then all yet may be well!&mdash;if he is not dead, he may recover!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He may; I hope he will!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now, then,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"tell me all: I can bear any intelligence but of death by human means."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I meant not to have gone &s;uch lengths; far from it; I hold duels in abhorrence, as unju&s;tifiable acts of violence, and &s;avage devices of revenge. I have offended again&s;t my own conviction,&mdash;but, tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion at his infamous charges, I was not ma&s;ter of my rea&s;on; I accu&s;ed him of his perfidy; he denied it; I told him I had it from my father,&mdash;he changed the &s;ubject to
<PB N="230" REF="229">
pour abu&s;e upon him; I in&s;i&s;ted on a re|cantation to clear you; he a&s;ked by what right? I fiercely an&s;wered, by a hu&s;band's! His countenance, then, explained at lea&s;t the motives of his treachery,&mdash;he loves you him&s;elf! he had probably &s;chemed to keep you free till his wife died, and then con|cluded his machinations would &s;ecure you his own. For this purpo&s;e, finding he was in danger of lo&s;ing you, he was content even to bla&s;t your character, rather than &s;uffer you to e&s;cape him! But the moment I ac|knowledged my marriage he grew more fu|rious than my&s;elf; and, in &s;hort&mdash;for why relate the frenzies of rage? we walked out together; my travelling pi&s;tols were already charged; I gave him his choice of them, and, the challenge being mine, for in&s;olence joined with guilt had robbed me of all for|bearance, he fired fir&s;t, but mi&s;&s;ed me: I then demanded whether he would clear your fame? he called out <Q REND="inline">"Fire! I will make no terms,"</Q>&mdash;I did fire,&mdash;and unfor|tunately aimed better! We had neither of us any &s;econd, all was the re&s;ult of imme|diate pa&s;&s;ion; but I &s;oon got people to him, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in conveying him home. He was at fir&s;t believed to be dead, and I was &s;eized by his &s;ervants; but he afterwards &s;hewed &s;igns of life, and by &s;ending for my friend Biddulph, I was relea&s;ed. Such is
<PB N="231" REF="230">
the melancholy tran&s;action I came to relate to you, flattering my&s;elf it would &s;ome|thing le&s;s &s;hock you from me than from another: yet my own real concern for the affair, the repentance with which from the moment the wretch fell, I was &s;truck in being his de&s;troyer, and the &s;orrow, the remor&s;e, rather, which I felt, in coming to wound you with &s;uch black, &s;uch fearful intelli|gence,&mdash;you to whom all I owe is peace and comfort!&mdash;the&s;e thoughts gave me &s;o much di&s;turbance, that, in fact, I knew le&s;s than any other how to prepare you for &s;uch a tale."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt; but Cecilia could &s;ay nothing: to cen&s;ure him now would both be cruel and vain; yet to pretend &s;he was &s;atisfied with his conduct, would be doing violence to her judgment and veracity. She &s;aw, too, that his error had &s;prung wholly from a generous ardor in her defence, and that his connfidence in her character, had re&s;i&s;ted, without wavering, every attack that mena|ced it. For this &s;he felt truly grateful; yet his quarrel with his father,&mdash;the danger of his mother.&mdash;his nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence,&mdash;her own clande&s;tine &s;ituation,&mdash;and more than all, the threatened death of Mr. Monckton by his hands, were circum&s;tan|ces &s;o full of dread and &s;adne&s;s, &s;he knew
<PB N="232" REF="231">
not upon which to &s;peak,&mdash;how to offer him comfort,&mdash;how to a&s;&s;ume a counte|nance that looked able to receive any, or by what means to repre&s;s the emotions which &s;o many ways a&s;&s;ailed her. Del|vile, having vainly waited &s;ome reply, then in a tone the mo&s;t melancholy, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If it is yet po&s;&s;ible you can be &s;ufficiently in|tere&s;ted in my fate to care what becomes of me, aid me now with your coun&s;el, or rather with your in&s;tructions; I am &s;carce able to think for my&s;elf, and to be thought for by you, would yet be a con&s;olation that would give me &s;pirit for any thing."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;tarting from her reverie, repeat|ed, <Q REND="inline">"To care what becomes of you? Oh Delvile!&mdash;make not my heart bleed by words of &s;uch unkindne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Forgive me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">I meant not a reproach; I meant but to &s;tate my own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s how little I de&s;erve from you. You talked to me of going to my father? do you &s;till wi&s;h it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think &s;o!"</Q> cried &s;he; too much di&s;|turbed to know what &s;he &s;aid, yet fearing again to hurt him by making him wait her an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will go then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"without doubt: too happy to be guided by you, which-ever way I &s;teer. I have now, indeed,
<PB N="233" REF="232">
much to tell him; but whatever may be his wrath, there is little fear, at this time, that my own temper cannot bear it! what next &s;hall I do?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What next?"</Q> repeated &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"indeed I know not!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall I go immediately to Margate? or &s;hall I fir&s;t ride hither?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you plea&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he much per|turbed, and deeply &s;ighing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I plea&s;e nothing but by your direction, to follow that is my only chance of plea|&s;ure. Which, then, &s;hall I do?&mdash;you will not, now, refu&s;e to direct me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, certainly, not for the world!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speak to me, then, my love, and tell me;&mdash;why are you thus &s;ilent?&mdash;is it pain|ful to you to coun&s;el me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, putting her hand to her head, <Q REND="inline">"I will &s;peak to you in a few minutes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh my Cecilia!"</Q> cried he, looking at her with much alarm, <Q REND="inline">"call back your recollection! you know not what you &s;ay, you take no intere&s;t in what you an&s;wer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I do!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;ighing deeply, and oppre&s;&s;ed beyond the power of think|ing, beyond any power but an internal con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233">
<Q REND="inline">"Sigh not &s;o bitterly,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"if you have any compa&s;&s;ion! &s;igh not &s;o bit|terly,&mdash;I cannot bear to hear you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry indeed!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, fighing again, and not &s;eeming &s;en&s;ible &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven!"</Q> cried he, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;tract me not with this horror!&mdash;&s;peak not to me in &s;uch broken &s;entences!&mdash;Do you hear me, Cecilia?&mdash;why will you not an&s;wer me?"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;tarted and trembled, looked pale and affrighted, and putting both her hands upon her heart, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Oh yes!&mdash;but I have an oppre&s;&s;ion here,&mdash;a tightne&s;s, a fulne&s;s,&mdash;I have not room for breath!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh beloved of my heart!"</Q> cried he, wildly ca&s;ting him&s;elf at her feet, <Q REND="inline">"kill me not with this terror!&mdash;call back your fa|culties,&mdash;awake from this dreadful in&s;en&s;i|bility! tell me at lea&s;t you know me!&mdash;tell me I have not tortured you quite to mad|ne&s;s!&mdash;&s;ole darling of my affections! my own, my wedded Cecilia!&mdash;re&s;cue me from this agony! it is more than I can &s;upport!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>This energy of di&s;tre&s;s brought back her &s;cattered &s;en&s;es, &s;carce more &s;tun|ned by the &s;hock of all this mi&s;ery, than by the re&s;traint of her feelings in

&s;truggling to conceal it. But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ion|ate exclamations re&s;toring her &s;en&s;ibility, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, which happily reliev|ed her mind from the conflict with which it was labouring, and which, not thus effected, might have ended more fatally.</P>
<P>Never had Delvile more rejoiced in her &s;miles than now in the&s;e &s;ea&s;onable tears, which he regarded and ble&s;t as the pre&s;er|vers of her rea&s;on. They flowed long without any intermi&s;&s;ion, his &s;oothing and tenderne&s;s but melting her to more &s;orrow: after a while, however, the return of her faculties, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed all con&s;ign|ed over to grief, was manife&s;ted by the return|ing &s;trength of her mind: &s;he blamed her|&s;elf &s;everely for the little fortitude &s;he had &s;hewn, but having now given vent to emo|tions too forcible to be wholly &s;tifled, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him he might depend upon her better courage for the future, and entreated him to con&s;ider and &s;ettle his affairs.</P>
<P>Not &s;peedily, however, could Delvile him&s;elf recover. The torture he had &s;uf|fered in believing, though only for a few moments, that the terror he had given to Cecilia had affected her intellects, made even a deeper impre&s;&s;ion upon his imagination, than the &s;cene of fury and death, which had occa&s;ioned that terror: and Cecilia, who
<PB N="236" REF="235">
now &s;trained every nerve to repair by her firmne&s;s, the pain which by her weakne&s;s &s;he had given him, was &s;ooner in a condi|tion for rea&s;oning and deliberation than him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah Delvile!"</Q> &s;he cried, comprehend|ing what pa&s;&s;ed within him, <Q REND="inline">"do you allow nothing for &s;urprize? and nothing for the hard conflict of endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s it? do you think me &s;till as unfit to advi&s;e with, and as worthle&s;s, as feeble a coun&s;el|lor, as during the fir&s;t confu&s;ion of my mind?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hurry not your tender &s;pirits, I be&s;eech you,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"we have time enough; we will talk about bu&s;ine&s;s by and by."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What time?"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what is it now o'clock?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven!"</Q> cried he, looking at his watch, <Q REND="inline">"already pa&s;t ten! you mu&s;t turn me out, my Cecilia, or calumny will &s;till be bu&s;y, even though poor Monckton is quiet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I <HI>will</HI> turn you out,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I am indeed mo&s;t earne&s;t to have you gone. But tell me your plan, and which way you mean to go?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;hall decide for me your&s;elf: whether to Delvile Ca&s;tle, to fini&s;h one tale, and wholly communicate
<PB N="237" REF="236">
another, or to Margate, to ha&s;ten my mo|ther abroad, before the news of this calami|ty reaches her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Go to Margate,"</Q> cried &s;he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"&s;et off this very moment! you can write to your father from O&s;tend. But continue, I conjure you, on the continent, till we &s;ee if this unhappy man lives, and enquire, of tho&s;e who can judge, what mu&s;t follow if he &s;hould not!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A trial,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t follow, and it will go, I fear, but hardly with me! the chal|lenge was mine; his &s;ervants can all witne&s;s I went to him, not he to me,&mdash;Oh my Ce|cilia! the ra&s;hne&s;s of which I have been guilty, is &s;o oppo&s;ite to my principles, and, all generous as is your &s;ilence, I know it &s;o oppo&s;ite to yours, that never, &s;hould his blood be on my hands, wretch as he was, never will my heart be quiet more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He will live, he will live!"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, repre&s;&s;ing her horror, <Q REND="inline">"fear nothing, for he will live;&mdash;and as to his wound and his &s;ufferings, his perfidy has de&s;erved them. Go, then, to Margate; think only of Mrs. Devile, and &s;ave her, if po&s;&s;ible, from hearing what has happened."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will go,&mdash;&s;tay,&mdash;do which and what|ever you bid me: but, &s;hould what I fear come to pa&s;s, &s;hould my mother continue
<PB N="238" REF="237">
ill, my father inflexible, &s;hould this wretch|ed man die, and &s;hould England no longer be a country I &s;hall love to dwell in,&mdash;could you, then, bear to own,&mdash;would you, then, con&s;ent to follow me?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Could I?&mdash;am I not yours? may you not command me? tell me, then,&mdash;you have only to &s;ay,&mdash;&s;hall I accompany you at once?"</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, affected by her genero&s;ity, could &s;carce utter his thanks; yet he did not he|&s;itate in denying to avail him&s;elf of it; <Q REND="inline">"No, my Cecilia,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I am not &s;o &s;elfi&s;h. If we have not happier days, we will at lea&s;t wait for more de&s;perate nece&s;&s;ity. With the uncertainty if I have not this man's life to an&s;wer for at the hazard of my own, to take my wife&mdash;my bride,&mdash;from the kingdom I mu&s;t fly!&mdash;to make her a fugitive and an exile in the fir&s;t publi&s;hing that &s;he is mine! No, if I am not a de&s;tined alien for life I can never permit it. Nothing le&s;s, believe me, &s;hall ever urge my con&s;ent to wound the cha&s;te propriety of your character, by making you an eloper with a dueli&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>They then again con&s;ulted upon their future plans; and concluded that in the pre&s;ent di&s;ordered &s;tate of their affairs, it would be be&s;t not to acknowledge even to
<PB N="239" REF="238">
Mr. Delvile their mariage, to whom the news of the duel, and Mr. Monckton's dan|ger, would be a blow &s;o &s;evere, that, to add to it any other might half di&s;tract him.</P>
<P>To the few people already acquainted with it, Delvile therefore determined to write from O&s;tend, re-urging his entreaties for their di&s;cretion and &s;ecre&s;y. Cecilia promi&s;ed every po&s;t to acquaint him how Mr. Monckton went on, and &s;he then be|&s;ought him to go in&s;tantly, that he might out-travel the ill news to his mother.</P>
<P>He complied, and took leave of her in the tendere&s;t manner, conjuring her to &s;up|port her &s;pirits, and be careful of her health. <Q REND="inline">"Happine&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"is much in arrears with us, and though my violence may have frightened it away, your &s;weet|ne&s;s and gentlene&s;s will yet attract it back: all that for me is in &s;tore mu&s;t be received at your hands,&mdash;what is offered in any o|ther way, I &s;hall only mi&s;take for evil! droop not, therefore, my generous Cecilia, but in your&s;elf pre&s;erve me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not droop;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"you will find, I hope, you have not intru&s;t|ed your&s;elf in ill hands."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Peace then be with you, my love!&mdash;my comforting, my &s;oul-reviving Cecilia! Peace, &s;uch as angels give, and &s;uch as may
<PB N="240" REF="239">
drive from your mind the remembrance of this bitter hour!"</Q></P>
<P>He then tore him&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who to his ble&s;&s;ings could almo&s;t, like the tender Belvidera, have exclaimed
<Q>O do not leave me!&mdash;&s;tay with me and cur&s;e me!</Q>
li&s;tened to his &s;teps till &s;he could hear them no longer, as if the remaining moments of her life were to be mea&s;ured by them: but then, remembering the danger both to her|&s;elf and him of his &s;tay, &s;he endeavoured to rejoice that he was gone, and, but that her mind was in no &s;tate for joy, was too rational not to have &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Grief and horror for what was pa&s;t, ap|prehen&s;ion and &s;u&s;pen&s;e for what was to come, &s;o di&s;ordered her whole frame, &s;o confu&s;ed even her intellects, that when not all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fancy could per&s;uade her &s;he &s;till heard the foot&s;teps of Delvile, &s;he went to the chair upon which he had been &s;eated, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, &s;at with her arms cro&s;&s;ed, &s;ilent, quiet, and erect, almo&s;t vacant of all thought, yet with a &s;ecret idea &s;he was doing &s;omething right.</P>
<P>Here &s;he continued till Henrietta came to wi&s;h her good night; who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e
<PB N="241" REF="240">
and concern at the &s;trangene&s;s of her look and attitude, once more recovered her. But terrified her&s;elf at this threatened wan|dering of her rea&s;on, and certain &s;he mu&s;t all night be a &s;tranger to re&s;t, &s;he accepted the affectionate offer of the kind-hearted girl to &s;tay with her, who was too much grie|ved for her grief to &s;leep any more than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She told her not what had pa&s;&s;ed; that, &s;he knew, would be fruitle&s;s affliction to her: but &s;he was &s;oothed by her gentlene&s;s, and her conver&s;ation was &s;ome &s;ecurity from the dangerous rambling of her ideas.</P>
<P>Henrietta her&s;elf found no little con&s;ola|tion in her own private &s;orrows, that &s;he was able to give comfort to her beloved Mi&s;s Beverley, from whom &s;he had receiv|ed favours and kind offices innumerable. &s;he quitted her not night nor day, and in the hone&s;t pride of a little power to &s;hew the gratefulne&s;s of her heart, &s;he felt a plea&s;ure and &s;elf-con&s;equence &s;he had never before experienced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A SUMMONS.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA's earlie&s;t care, almo&s;t at break of day, was to &s;end to the Grove; from thence &s;he heard nothing but evil; Mr. Monckton was &s;till alive, but with little or no hope of recovery, con|&s;tantly delirious, and talking of Mi&s;s Be|verley, and of her being married to young Delvile.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who knew well this, at lea&s;t, was no delirium, though &s;hocked that he talk|ed of it, hoped his danger le&s;s than was apprehended.</P>
<P>The next day, however, more fatal news was brought her, though not from the quarter &s;he expected it: Mr. Monckton, in one of his raving fits, had &s;ent for Lady Margaret to his bed &s;ide, and u&s;ed her al|mo&s;t inhumanly: he had railed at her age and infirmities with incredible fury, called her the cau&s;e of all his &s;ufferings, and ac|cu&s;ed her as the immediate agent of Luci|fer in his pre&s;ent wound and danger. Lady
<PB N="243" REF="242">
Margaret, whom neither jealou&s;y nor ma|lignity had cured of loving him, was di&s;|mayed and affrighted; and in hurrying out of the room upon his attempting, in his frenzy, to &s;trike her, &s;he dropt down dead in an apoplectic fit.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven! thought Cecilia, what an exemplary puni&s;hment has this man! he loo&s;es his hated wife at the very moment when her death could no longer an&s;wer his purpo&s;es! Poor Lady Margaret! her life has been as bitter as her temper! married from a view of intere&s;t, ill u&s;ed as a bar to happine&s;s, and de&s;troyed from the fruitle&s;s ravings of de&s;pair!"</Q></P>
<P>She wrote all this intelligence to O&s;tend, whence &s;he received a letter from Delvile, acquainting her he was detained from pro|ceeding further by the weakne&s;s and illne&s;s of his mother, who&s;e &s;ufferings from &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;s had almo&s;t put an end to her ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed a mi&s;erable week; Monck|ton &s;till merely alive, Delvile detained at O&s;tend, and Cecilia tortured alike by what was recently pa&s;&s;ed, actually pre&s;ent, and fear|fully expected; when one morning &s;he was told a gentleman upon bu&s;ine&s;s de&s;ired im|mediately to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tily obeyed the &s;ummons; the
<PB N="244" REF="243">
con&s;tant image of her own mind, Delvile, being already pre&s;ent to her, and a thou&s;and wild conjectures upon what had brought him back, rapidly occurring to her.</P>
<P>Her expectations, however, were ill an|&s;wered, for &s;he found an entire &s;tranger; an elderly man, of no plea&s;ant a&s;pect or manners.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to know his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I pre&s;ume, madam, you are the lady of this hou&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P>She bowed an a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May I take the liberty, madam, to a&s;k your name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My name, &s;ir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will do me a favour, madam, by telling it me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible you are come hither with|out already knowing it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know it only by common report, madam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Common report, &s;ir, I believe is &s;eldom wrong in a matter where to be right is &s;o ea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you any objection, madam, to telling me your name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, &s;ir; but your bu&s;ine&s;s can hardly be very important, if you are yet to learn whom you are to addre&s;s. It will be time enough, therefore, for us to meet when you are el&s;ewhere &s;atisfied in this point."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="244">
She would then have left the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg, madam,"</Q> cried the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"you will have patience; it is nece&s;&s;ary, before I can open my bu&s;ine&s;s, that I &s;hould hear your name from your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;ir,"</Q> cried &s;he with &s;ome he&s;ita|tion, <Q REND="inline">"you can &s;carce have come to this hou&s;e, without knowing that its owner is Cecilia Beverley."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, madam, is your maiden name."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My maiden name?"</Q> cried &s;he, &s;tart|ing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you not married, madam?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Married, &s;ir?"</Q> &s;he repeated, while her cheeks were the colour of &s;carlet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is, properly, therefore, madam, the name of your hu&s;band that I mean to a&s;k."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And by what authority, &s;ir,"</Q> cried &s;he, equally a&s;toni&s;hed and offended, <Q REND="inline">"do you make the&s;e extraordinary enquiries?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am deputed, madam, to wait upon you by Mr. Eggle&s;ton, the next heir to this e&s;tate, by your uncle's will, if you die without children, or change your name when you marry. His authority of enqui|ry, madam, I pre&s;ume you will allow, and he has ve&s;ted it in me by a letter of attorney."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="245">
Cecilia's di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion were now un&s;peakable; &s;he knew not what to own or deny, &s;he could not conjecture how &s;he had been betrayed, and &s;he had never made the &s;malle&s;t preparation again&s;t &s;uch an attack.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Eggle&s;ton,"</Q> madam, he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"has been pretty credibly informed that you are actually married: he is very de&s;irous, therefore, to know what are your intentions, for your continuing to be called <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Beverley, as if &s;till &s;ingle, leaves him quite in the dark: but, as he is &s;o deeply concerned in the affair, he expects, as a lady of honour, you will deal with him without prevarication."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This demand, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;tam|mering, <Q REND="inline">"is &s;o extremely&mdash;&s;o&mdash;&s;o little expected&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The way, madam, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is to keep pretty clo&s;ely to the point; are you married or are you not?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, quite confounded, made no an|&s;wer: to di&s;avow her marriage, when thus formally called upon, was every way unju&s;|tifiable; to acknowledge it in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, would involve her in difficulties innumerable,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is not, madam, a &s;light thing; Mr. Eggle&s;ton has a large family and a &s;mall

fortune, and that, into the bargain, very much encumbered; it cannot, therefore, be expected that he will knowingly connive at cheating him&s;elf, by &s;ubmitting to your being actually married, and &s;till enjoying your e&s;tate though your hu&s;band does not take your name."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, now, &s;ummoning more pre&s;ence of mind, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Eggle&s;ton, &s;ir, has, at lea&s;t, nothing to fear from impo&s;i|tion: tho&s;e with whom he has, or may have any tran&s;actions in this affair, are not ac|cu&s;tomed to practice it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am far from meaning any offence, madam; my commi&s;&s;ion from Mr. Eggle&s;ton is &s;imply this, to beg you will &s;atisfy him upon what grounds you now evade the will of your late uncle, which, till cleared up, appears a point manife&s;tly to his preju|dice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tell him, then, &s;ir, that whatever he wi&s;hes to know &s;hall be explained to him in about a week. At pre&s;ent I can give no other an&s;wer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very well, madam; he will wait that time, I am &s;ure, for he does not wi&s;h to put you to any inconvenience. But when he heard the gentleman was gone abroad without owning his marriage, he thought it high time to take &s;ome notice of the matter."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="247">

<P><Q REND="inline">"That, madam,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"may perhaps bear a little contention: for when this bu&s;ine&s;s comes to be &s;ettled, it will be very e&s;&s;ential to be exact as to the time, even to the very hour; for a large income per annum, divides into a &s;mall one per diem; and if your hu&s;band keeps his own name, you mu&s;t not only give up your uncle's inheritance from the time of relinqui&s;hing yours, but refund from the very day of your marriage."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is not the lea&s;t doubt of it,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"nor will the &s;malle&s;t diffi|culty be made."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Eggle&s;ton, madam, happens to be well informed of this tran&s;action, as, if there is any di&s;pute in it, you will find. He was your immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the hou&s;e to which you went la&s;t September in in Pall-Mall; the woman who kept it ac|quainted his &s;ervants that the la&s;t lady who hired it &s;tayed with her but a day, and only came to town, &s;he found, to be married: and hearing, upon enquiry, this lady was Mi&s;s Beverley, the &s;ervants, well knowing that their ma&s;ter was her conditional heir, old him the circum&s;tance."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"We have traced, madam, many wit|ne&s;&s;es able to &s;tand to divers particulars; and eight months &s;hare of &s;uch an e&s;tate as this, is well worth a little trouble."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Eggle&s;ton, madam, has behaved very honourably; though he knew the whole affair &s;o long ago, he was per&s;uaded Mr. Delvile had private rea&s;ons for a &s;hort concealment;

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A DELIBERATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary, however, not to moral|ize, but to act; Cecilia had undertaken to give her an&s;wer in a week, and the art|ful attorney had drawn from her an acknow|ledgement of her &s;ituation, by which he might claim it yet &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The law-&s;uit with which &s;he was threa|tened for the arrears of eight months, alar|med her not, though it &s;hocked her, as &s;he was certain &s;he could prove her marriage &s;o much later.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive that this man had been &s;ent with a view of working from her a confe&s;&s;ion, and terrifying from her &s;ome money; the confe&s;&s;ion, indeed, in con&s;cience and hone&s;ty &s;he could not whol|ly elude, but &s;he had &s;uffered too often by a facility in parting with money to be there ea&s;ily duped.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, was more true, than that &s;he now lived upon an e&s;tate of which &s;he no longer was the owner, and that all &s;he either &s;pent or received was to be accounted
<PB N="254" REF="253">
for and returned, &s;ince by the will of her uncle, unle&s;s her hu&s;band took her name, her e&s;tate on the very day of her marriage was to be forfeited, and entered upon by the Eggle&s;tons. Delvile's plan and hope of &s;ecre&s;y had made them little weigh this matter, though this premature di&s;co|very &s;o unexpectedly expo&s;ed her to their power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thought that occurred to her, was to &s;end an expre&s;s to Delvile, and de&s;ire his in&s;tructions how to proceed; but &s;he dread|ed his impetuo&s;ity of temper, and was al|mo&s;t certain that the in&s;tant he &s;hould hear &s;he was in any unea&s;ine&s;s or perplexity, he would return to her at all hazards, even though Mr. Monckton were dead, and his mother her&s;elf dying. This &s;tep, there|fore, &s;he did not dare ri&s;k, preferring any per&s;onal hard&s;hip, to endangering the al|ready precarious life of Mrs. Delvile, or to ha&s;tening her &s;on home while Mr. Monck|ton was in &s;o de&s;perate a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>But though what to avoid was ea&s;y to &s;ettle, what to &s;eek was difficult to devi&s;e. She had now no Mrs. Charlton to receive her, nor a creature in whom &s;he could con|fide. To continue her pre&s;ent way of liv|ing was deeply involving Delvile in debt, a circum&s;tance &s;he had never con&s;idered, in the confu&s;ion and hurry attending all
<PB N="255" REF="254">
their plans and conver&s;ations, and a cir|cum&s;tance which, though to him it might have occurred, he could not in common delicacy mention.</P>
<P>Yet to have quitted her hou&s;e, and re|trenched her expences, would have rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picions that mu&s;t have anticipated the di&s;covery &s;he &s;o much wi&s;hed to have de|layed. That wi&s;h, by the pre&s;ent danger of its failure, was but more ardent; to have her affairs and &s;ituation become pub|licly known at the pre&s;ent period, &s;he felt would half di&s;tract her.&mdash;Privately mar|ried, parted from her hu&s;band at the very moment of their union, a hu&s;band by who&s;e hand the apparent friend of her earlie&s;t youth was all but killed, who&s;e father had execrated the match, who&s;e mother was now falling a &s;acrifice to the vehemence with which &s;he had oppo&s;ed it, and who him|&s;elf, little &s;hort of an exile, knew not yet if, with per&s;onal &s;afety, he might return to his native land!</P>
<P>To circum&s;tances &s;o dreadful, &s;he had now the additional &s;hock of being uncer|tain whether her own hou&s;e might not be &s;eized, before any other could be prepar|ed for her reception!</P>
<P>Yet &s;till whither to go, what to do, or what to re&s;olve, &s;he was wholly unable to
<PB N="256" REF="255">
determine; and after meditating almo&s;t to madne&s;s in the &s;earch of &s;ome plan or ex|pedient, &s;he was obliged to give over the attempt, and be &s;atisfied with remaining quietly where &s;he was, till &s;he had better news from Delvile of his mother, or better news to &s;end him of Mr. Monckton; care|fully, mean time, in all her letters avoiding to alarm him by any hint of her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet was &s;he not idle, either from de&s;pair or helple&s;&s;ne&s;s: &s;he found her difficulties encrea&s;ed, and &s;he called forth more re&s;olu|tion to combat them: &s;he animated her&s;elf by the promi&s;e &s;he had made Delvile, and recovering from the &s;adne&s;s to which &s;he had at fir&s;t given way, &s;he now exerted her&s;elf with vigour to perform it as &s;he ought.</P>
<P>She began by making an immediate in|&s;pection into her affairs, and endeavouring, where expence &s;eemed unnece&s;&s;ary, to le&s;&s;en it. She gave Henrietta to under&s;tand &s;he feared they mu&s;t &s;oon part; and &s;o afflic|ted was the unhappy girl at the news, that &s;he found it the mo&s;t cruel office &s;he had to execute. The &s;ame intimation &s;he gave to Mrs. Harrel, who repined at it more openly, but with a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;o evi|dent that it blunted the edge of pity. She then announced to Albany her inability to pur&s;ue, at pre&s;ent, their exten&s;ive &s;chemes
<PB N="257" REF="256">
of benevolence; and though he in&s;tantly left her, to carry on his laborious plan el&s;e|where, the reverence &s;he had now excited in him of her character, made him leave her with no &s;en&s;ation but of regret, and readily promi&s;e to return when her affairs were &s;ettled, or her mind more compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e little preparations, which were all &s;he could make, with enquiries after Mr. Monckon, and writing to Delvile, &s;uffi|ciently filled up her time, though her thoughts were by no means confined to them. Day after day pa&s;&s;ed, and Mr. Monckton continued to linger rather than live; the letters of Delvile, &s;till only dated from O&s;tend, contained the mo&s;t melan|choly complaints of the illne&s;s of his mo|ther; and the time advanced when her an|&s;wer would be claimed by the attorney.</P>
<P>The thought of &s;uch another vi&s;it was almo&s;t intolerable; and within two days of the time that &s;he expected it, &s;he re&s;olved to endeavour her&s;elf to prevail with Mr. Eggle&s;ton to wait longer.</P>
<P>Mr. Eggle&s;ton was a gentleman whom &s;he knew little more than by &s;ight; he was no relation to her family, nor had any connection with the Dean, but by being a cou&s;in to a lady he had married, and who had left him no children. The dean had no particular regard for him, and had rather
<PB N="258" REF="257">
mentioned him in his will as the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of Cecilia, in ca&s;e &s;he died unmar|ried or changed her name, as a mark that he approved of her doing neither, than as a matter he thought probable, if even po&s;&s;i|ble, to turn out in his favour.</P>
<P>He was a man of a large family, the &s;ons of which, who were extravagant and di&s;&s;ipated, had much impaired his fortune by prevailing with him to pay their debts, and much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him in his affairs by &s;ucce&s;sfully tea&s;ing him for money.</P>
<P>Cecilia, acquainted with the&s;e circum|&s;tances, knew but too well with what avi|dity her e&s;tate would be &s;eized by them, and how little the &s;ons would endure de|lay, even if the father con&s;ented to it. Yet &s;ince the &s;acrifice to which &s;he had agreed mu&s;t &s;oon make it indi&s;putably their own, &s;he determined to deal with them openly; and acknowledged, therefore, in her letter, her marriage without di&s;gui&s;e, but begged their patience and &s;ecre&s;y, and promi&s;ed, in a &s;hort time, the mo&s;t honourable retri|bution and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>She &s;ent this letter by a man and hor&s;e, Mr. Eggle&s;ton's habitation being within fifteen miles of her own.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer was from his elde&s;t &s;on, who acquainted her that his father was very ill, and had put all his affairs into the hands of
<PB N="259" REF="258">
Mr. Carn, his attorney, who was a man of great credit, and would &s;ee ju&s;tice done on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>If this an&s;wer, which &s;he broke open the in&s;tant &s;he took it into her hand, was in it&s;elf a cruel di&s;appointment to her, how was that di&s;appointment embittered by &s;hame and terror, when, upon again fold|ing it up, &s;he &s;aw it was directed to Mrs. Mortimer Delvile!</P>
<P>This was a deci&s;ive &s;troke; what they wrote to her, &s;he was &s;ure they would men|tion to all others; &s;he &s;aw they were too impatient for her e&s;tate to be moved by any repre&s;entations to a delay, and that their eagerne&s;s to publi&s;h their right, took from them all con&s;ideration of what they might make her &s;uffer. Mr. Eggle&s;ton, &s;he found, permitted him&s;elf to be wholly governed by his &s;on; his &s;on was a needy and profligate &s;pendthrift, and by throw|ing the management of the affair into the hands of an attorney, craftily meant to &s;hield him&s;elf from the future re&s;entment of Delvile, to whom, hereafter, he might af|fect, at his convenience, to di&s;approve Mr. Carn's behaviour, while Mr. Carn was al|ways &s;ecure, by averring he only exerted him&s;elf for the intere&s;t of his client.</P>
<P>The di&s;cerning Cecilia, though but little experienced in bu&s;ine&s;s, and wholly un|&s;u&s;picious
<PB N="260" REF="259">
by nature, yet &s;aw into this ma|nagement, and doubted not the&s;e excu&s;es were already arranged. She had only, therefore, to &s;ave her&s;elf an actual eject|ment, by quitting a hou&s;e in which &s;he was expo&s;ed to &s;uch a di&s;grace.</P>
<P>But &s;till whither to go &s;he knew not! One only attempt &s;eemed in her power for an honourable a&s;ylum, and that was more irk|&s;omely painful to her than &s;eeking &s;helter in the meane&s;t retreat: it was applying to Mr. Delvile &s;enior.</P>
<P>The action of leaving her hou&s;e, whether quietly or forcibly, could not but in&s;tantly authenticate the reports &s;pread by the Eggle|&s;tons of her marriage: to hope therefore for &s;ecre&s;y any longer would be folly, and Mr. Delvile's rage at &s;uch intelligence might be &s;till greater to hear it by chance than from her&s;elf. She now lamented that Del|vile had not at once told the tale, lit|tle fore&s;eeing &s;uch a di&s;covery as the pre|&s;ent, they had mutually concluded to defer the communication till his return.</P>
<P>Her own anger at the contemptuous ill treatment &s;he had repeatedly met from him, &s;he was now content not merely to &s;uppre&s;s but to di&s;mi&s;s, &s;ince, as the wife of his &s;on without his con&s;ent, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf no longer as wholly innocent of incurring it. Yet, &s;uch was her dread of his au&s;terity
<PB N="261" REF="260">
and the arrogance of his reproaches, that, by choice, &s;he would have preferred an habitation with her own pen&s;ioner, the pew-opener, to the grande&s;t apartment in Delvile Ca&s;tle while he continued its lord.</P>
<P>In her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, however, her choice was little to be con&s;ulted: the ho|nour of Delvile was concerned in her e&s;cap|ing even temporary di&s;grace, and nothing, &s;he knew, would &s;o much gratify him, as any attention from her to his father. She wrote to him, therefore, the following let|ter, which &s;he &s;ent by an expre&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>APRIL 29th, 1780.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hould not, even by letter, pre&s;ume thus to force my&s;elf upon your remem|brance, did I not think it a duty I now owe your &s;on, both to ri&s;k and to bear the di&s;|plea&s;ure it may unhappily occa&s;ion. After &s;uch an acknowledgment, all other con|fe&s;&s;ion would be &s;uperfluous; and uncer|tain as I am if you will ever deign to own me, more words than are nece&s;&s;ary would be merely impertinent.</P>
<P>It was the intention of your &s;on, Sir, when he left the kingdom, to &s;ubmit wholly
<PB N="262" REF="261">
to your arbitration, at his return, which &s;hould be re&s;igned, his own name or my fortune: but his reque&s;t for your deci&s;ion, and his &s;upplication for your forgivene&s;s, are both, mo&s;t unfortunately, prevented, by a premature and unfore&s;een di&s;covery of our &s;ituation, which renders an immediate determination ab&s;olutely unavoidable.</P>
<P>At this di&s;tance from him, I cannot, in time, receive his directions upon the mea|&s;ures I have to take; pardon me then, Sir, if well knowing my reference to him will not be more implicit than his own to you, I venture, in the pre&s;ent important cri&s;is of my affairs, to entreat tho&s;e commands in&s;tantly, by which I am certain of being guided ultimately.</P>
<P>I would commend my&s;elf to your favour but that I dread exciting your re&s;entment. I will detain you, therefore, only to add, that the father of Mr. Mortimer Devile, will ever meet the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect from her who, without his permi&s;&s;ion, dares &s;ign no name to the honour &s;he now has in declaring her&s;elf</P>

<P>Her mind was &s;omewhat ea&s;ier when this letter was written, becau&s;e &s;he thought it a duty, yet felt reluctance in performing it.
<PB N="263" REF="262">
She wi&s;hed to have repre&s;ented to him &s;trongly the danger of Delvile's hearing her di&s;tre&s;s, but &s;he knew &s;o well his inordinate &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, &s;he feared a hint of that &s;ort might be con&s;trued into an in&s;ult, and con|cluded her only chance that he would do any thing, was by leaving wholly to his own &s;ugge&s;tions the weighing and &s;ettling what.</P>
<P>But though nothing was more uncertain than whether &s;he &s;hould be received at Del|vile Ca&s;tle, nothing was more fixed than that &s;he mu&s;t quit her own hou&s;e, &s;ince the pride of Mr. Delvile left not even a chance that his intere&s;t would conquer it. She de|ferred not, therefore, any longer making preparations for her removal, though wholly un&s;ettled whither.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t, which was al&s;o her mo&s;t pain|ful ta&s;k, was to acquaint Henrietta with her &s;ituation: &s;he &s;ent, therefore, to de&s;ire to &s;peak with her, but the countenance of Henrietta &s;hewed her communication would not &s;urpri&s;e her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is the matter with my dear Hen|rietta?"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"who is it has al|ready afflicted that kind heart which I am now compelled to afflict for my&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, in whom anger appeared to be &s;truggling with &s;orrow, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No,
<PB N="264" REF="263">
madam, not afflicted for <HI>you!</HI> it would be &s;trange if I were, thinking as I think!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am glad,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, calmly, <Q REND="inline">"if you are not, "for I would give to you, were it po&s;&s;ible, nothing but plea&s;ure and joy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> cried Henrietta, bur&s;t|ing into tears, <Q REND="inline">"why will you &s;ay &s;o when you don't care what becomes of me! when you are going to ca&s;t me off!&mdash;and when you will &s;oon be too happy ever to think of me more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I am never happy till then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ad, indeed, will be my life! no, my gentle&s;t friend, you will always have your &s;hare in my heart; and always, to me, would have been the welcome&s;t gue&s;t in my hou&s;e, but for tho&s;e unhappy circum|&s;tances which make our &s;eparating inevi|table."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet you &s;uffered me, madam, to hear from any body that you was married and going away; and all the common &s;ervants in the hou&s;e knew it before me."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"The man that went to Mr. Eggle&s;ton brought the fir&s;t news of it, for he &s;aid all the &s;ervants there talked of nothing el&s;e, and that their ma&s;ter was to come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion here next Thur&s;day."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="264">
Cecilia &s;tarted at this mo&s;t unwelcome intelligence; <Q REND="inline">"Yet you envy me,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"Henrietta, though I am forced from my hou&s;e! though in quitting it, I am unprovided with any other, and though him for whom I relinqui&s;h it, is far off, without means of protecting, or power of returning to me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you are married to him, madam!"</Q> cried &s;he, expre&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, my love; but, al&s;o, I am parted from him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh how differently,"</Q> exclaimed Hen|rietta, <Q REND="inline">"do the great think from the little! were <HI>I</HI> married,&mdash;and <HI>&s;o</HI> married, I &s;hould want neither hou&s;e, nor fine cloaths, nor riches, nor any thing;&mdash;I &s;hould not care where I lived,&mdash;every place would be para|di&s;e! I would walk to him barefoot if he were a thou&s;and miles off, and I &s;hould mind nobody el&s;e in the world while I had him to take care of me!"</Q></P>
<P>Ah Delvile! thought Cecilia, what powers of fa&s;cination are yours! &s;hould I be tempted to repine at what I have to bear, I will think of this heroick girl, and blu&s;h!</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel now broke in upon them, eager to be informed of the truth or fal&s;e|hood of the reports which were buzzed
<PB N="266" REF="265">
throughout the hou&s;e. Cecilia briefly re|lated to them both the &s;tate of her affairs, earne&s;tly expre&s;&s;ing her concern at the abrupt &s;eparation which mu&s;t take place, and for which &s;he had been unable to pre|pare them, as the circum&s;tances which led to it had been wholly unfore&s;een by her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel li&s;tened to the account with much curio&s;ity and &s;urprize; but Henrietta wept ince&s;&s;antly in hearing it: the object of a pa&s;&s;ion ardent as it was romantic, lo&s;t to her pa&s;t recovery; torn her&s;elf, probably for ever, from the be&s;t friend &s;he had in the world; and obliged to return thus &s;uddenly to an home &s;he dete&s;ted,&mdash;Henrietta po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed not the fortitude to hear evils &s;uch as the&s;e, which, to her inexperienced heart, appeared the &s;evere&s;t that could be inflict|ed.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation over, Cecilia &s;ent for her Steward, and de&s;ired him, with the ut|mo&s;t expedition, to call in all her bills, and in&s;tantly to go round to her tenants within twenty miles, and gather in, from tho&s;e who were able to pay, the arrears now due to her; charging him, however, upon no ac|count, to be urgent with &s;uch as &s;eemed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>Mr. Cran then informed her &s;he might put her &s;eal upon whatever &s;he meant here|after to claim or di&s;pute, and took his leave.</P>
<P>Cecilia now &s;hut her&s;elf up in her own room, to meditate without interruption, before &s;he would proceed to any action.
<PB N="271" REF="270">
She felt much inclination to &s;end in&s;tantly for &s;ome lawyer; but when &s;he con&s;idered her peculiar &s;ituation, the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, the renunciation of his father, the lo&s;s of her fortune, and her ignorance upon the &s;ubject, &s;he thought it better to re&s;t quiet till Delvile's own fate, and own opinion could be known, than to involve her&s;elf in a law&s;uit &s;he was &s;o little able to &s;uperintend.</P>
<P>In this cruel perplexity of her mind and her affairs, her fir&s;t thought was to board again with Mrs. Bayley; but that was &s;oon given up, for &s;he felt a repugnance uncon|querable to continuing in her native coun|ty, when deprived of her fortune, and ca&s;t out of her dwelling. Her &s;ituation, in|deed, was &s;ingularly unhappy, &s;ince, by this unfore&s;een vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, &s;he was &s;uddenly, from being an object of envy and admiration, &s;unk into di&s;tre&s;s, and threatened with di&s;grace; from being every where care&s;&s;ed, and by every voice prai&s;ed, &s;he blu&s;hed to be &s;een, and ex|pected to be cen&s;ured; and, from being generally regarded as an example of hap|pine&s;s, and a model of virtue, &s;he was now in one moment to appear to the world, an outca&s;t from her own hou&s;e, yet received into no other! a bride, unclaimed by a
<PB N="272" REF="271">
hu&s;band! an HEIRESS, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all wealth!</P>
<P>To be fir&s;t acknowledged as <HI>Mrs. Delvile</HI> in a &s;tate &s;o degrading, &s;he could not en|dure; and to e&s;cape from it, one way alone remained, which was going in&s;tantly abroad.</P>
<P>Upon this, therefore, &s;he finally de|termined: her former objections to &s;uch a &s;tep being now wholly, though unplea&s;antly removed, &s;ince &s;he had neither e&s;tate nor affairs to demand her &s;tay, and &s;ince all hopes of concealment were totally at an end. Her marriage, therefore, and its di&s;graceful con&s;equences being publi&s;hed to the world, &s;he re&s;olved without delay to &s;eek the only a&s;ylum which was proper for her, in the protection of the hu&s;band for whom &s;he had given up every other.</P>
<P>She purpo&s;ed, therefore, to go imme|diately and privately to London, whence &s;he could be&s;t &s;ettle her route for the con|tinent: where &s;he hoped to arrive before the news of her di&s;tre&s;s reached Delvile, whom nothing, &s;he was certain, but her own pre&s;ence, could keep there for a mo|ment after hearing it.</P>
<P>Thus decided, at length, in her plan, &s;he proceeded to put it in execution with calmne&s;s and intrepidity; comforting her|&s;elf that the conveniencies and indulgencies
<PB N="273" REF="272">
with which &s;he was now parting, would &s;oon be re&s;tored to her, and though not with equal power, with far more &s;atisfac|tion. She told her &s;teward her de&s;ign of going the next morning to London, bid him pay in&s;tantly all her debts, and di&s;|charge all her &s;ervants, determining to keep no account open but that with Mr. Eggle&s;ton, which he had made &s;o intricate by double and undue demands, that &s;he thought it mo&s;t prudent and &s;afe to leave him wholly to Delvile.</P>
<P>She then packed up all her papers and letters, and ordered her maid to pack up her clothes.</P>
<P>She next put her own &s;eal upon her cabi|nets, draws, and many other things, and employed almo&s;t all her &s;ervants at once, in making complete inventories of what every room contained.</P>
<P>She advi&s;ed Mrs. Harrel to &s;end without delay for Mr. Arnott, and return to his hou&s;e. She had fir&s;t purpo&s;ed to carry Henrietta home to her mother her&s;elf; but another &s;cheme for her now occurred, from which &s;he hoped much future advantage to the amiable and dejected girl.</P>
<P>She knew well, that deep as was at pre|&s;ent her de&s;pondency, the removal of all po&s;&s;ibility of hope, by her knowledge of Delvile's marriage, mu&s;t awaken her before
<PB N="274" REF="273">
long from the delu&s;ive vi&s;ions of her romantic fancy; Mr. Arnott him&s;elf was in a &s;ituation exactly &s;imilar, and the know|ledge of the &s;ame event would probably be productive of the &s;ame effect. When Mrs. Harrel, therefore, began to repine at the &s;olitude to which &s;he was returning, Ceci|lia propo&s;ed to her the &s;ociety of Henrietta, which, glad to catch at any thing that would break into her loneline&s;s, &s;he li&s;tened to with plea&s;ure, and &s;econded by an invi|tation.</P>
<P>Henrietta, to whom all hou&s;es appeared preferable to her own home, joyfully ac|cepted the offer, committing to Cecilia the communication of the change of her abode to Mrs. Belfield.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who in the known and tried ho|nour of Mr. Arnott would unreluctantly have tru&s;ted a &s;i&s;ter, was much plea&s;ed by this little arrangement, from which &s;hould no good en&s;ue, no evil, at lea&s;t, was pro|bable. But &s;he hoped, through the mutual pity their mutual melancholy might in&s;pire, that their minds, already not di&s;&s;imilar, would be &s;oftened in favour of each other, and that, in conclu&s;ion, each might be hap|py in receiving the con&s;olation each could give, and a union would take place, in which their reciprocal di&s;appointment might, in time, be nearly forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="274">
There was not, indeed, much promi&s;e of &s;uch an event in the countenance of Mr. Arnott, when, late at night, he came for his &s;i&s;ter, nor in the unbounded &s;orrow of Henrietta, when the moment of leave-tak|ing arrived. Mr. Arnott looked half dead with the &s;hock his &s;i&s;ter's intelligence had given him, and Henrietta's heart, torn a&s;under between friend&s;hip and love, was &s;carce able to bear a parting, which from Cecilia, &s;he regarded as eternal, added to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s it was occa&s;ioned by her going to join Delvile for life!</P>
<P>Cecilia, who both read and pitied the&s;e conflicting emotions, was her&s;elf extremely hurt by this nece&s;&s;ary &s;eparation. She tenderly loved Henrietta, &s;he loved her even the more for the &s;ympathy of their affections, which called forth the mo&s;t for|cible commi&s;eration,&mdash;that which &s;prings from fellow feeling!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Farewell,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"my Henrietta, be but happy as you are innocent, and be both as I love you, and nothing will your friends have to wi&s;h for you, or your&s;elf to regret."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t always regret,"</Q> cried the &s;ob|bing Henrietta, <Q REND="inline">"that I cannot live with you for ever! I &s;hould regret it if I were queen of all the world, how much more then, when I am nothing and nobody! I
<PB N="276" REF="275">
do not wi&s;h <HI>you</HI> happy, madam, for I think happine&s;s was made on purpo&s;e for you, and nobody el&s;e ever had it before; I only wi&s;h you health and long life, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who will be made as happy as you,&mdash;for you will &s;poil them,&mdash;as you have &s;poilt me,&mdash;from being ever happy without you!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia re-iterated her a&s;&s;urances of a mo&s;t faithful regard, embraced Mrs. Har|rel, &s;poke words of kindne&s;s to the droop|ing Mr. Arnott, and then parted with them all.</P>
<P>Having &s;till many &s;mall matters to &s;ettle, and neither company nor appetite, &s;he would eat no &s;upper; but, in pa&s;&s;ing thro' the hall, in her way to her own room, &s;he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee all her dome&s;tics a&s;&s;embled in a body. She &s;topt to enquire their intention, when they eagerly pre&s;&s;ed forward, humbly and earne&s;tly entreating to know why they were di&s;charged?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For no rea&s;on in the world,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but becau&s;e it is at pre&s;ent out of my power to keep you any longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dont part with <HI>me,</HI> madam, for that,"</Q> cried one of them, <Q REND="inline">"for I will &s;erve you for nothing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So will I!"</Q> cried another, <Q REND="inline">"And I!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And I!"</Q> was echoed by them all; while <Q REND="inline">"no other &s;uch mi&s;tre&s;s is to be found?"</Q>
<PB N="277" REF="276">
<Q REND="inline">"We can never bear any other place!"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"keep <HI>me,</HI> madam, at lea&s;t!"</Q> was even cla|morou&s;ly urged by each of them.</P>
<P>Cecilia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;lattered at once by their unwillingne&s;s to quit her, received this te&s;timony of gratitude for the kind and liberal treatment they had received, with the warme&s;t thanks both for their &s;ervices and fidelity, and a&s;&s;ured them that when again &s;he was &s;ettled, all tho&s;e who &s;hould be yet unprovided with places, &s;hould be preferred in her hou&s;e before any other claimants.</P>
<P>Having, with difficulty, broken from them, &s;he &s;ent for her own man, Ralph, who had lived with her many years before the death of the Dean, and told him &s;he meant &s;till to continue him in her &s;ervice. The man heard it with great delight, and promi&s;ed to re-double his deligence to de|&s;erve her favour. She then communicated the &s;ame news to her maid, who had al&s;o re&s;ided with her &s;ome years, and by whom with the &s;ame, or more plea&s;ure it was heard.</P>
<P>The&s;e and other regulations employed her almo&s;t all night; yet late and fatigued as &s;he went to bed, &s;he could not clo&s;e her eyes: fearful &s;omething was left undone, &s;he robbed her&s;elf of the &s;hort time &s;he had allowed to re&s;t, by ince&s;&s;ant meditation
<PB N="278" REF="277">
upon what yet remained to be executed. She could recollect, however, one only thing that had e&s;caped her vigilance, which was acquainting the pew-opener, and two or three other poor women who had week|ly pen&s;ions from her, that they mu&s;t, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, depend no longer upon her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nothing indeed could be more painful to her than giving them &s;uch information, yet not to be &s;peedy with it would double the barbarity of their di&s;appointment. She even felt for the&s;e poor women, who&s;e lo&s;s in her &s;he knew would be irreparable, a compa&s;&s;ion that drove from her mind al|mo&s;t every other &s;ubject, and determined her, in order to &s;often to them this mi&s;|fortune, to communicate it her&s;elf, that &s;he might prevent their from &s;inking under it, by reviving them with hopes of her future a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>She had ordered at &s;even o'clock in the morning an hired chai&s;e at the door, and &s;he did not &s;uffer it long to wait for her. She quitted her hou&s;e with a heart full of care and anxiety, grieving at the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;uch a &s;acrifice, uncertain how it would turn out, and labouring under a thou&s;and perplexities with re&s;pect to the mea&s;ures &s;he ought immediately to take. She pa&s;&s;ed, when &s;he reached the hall,
<PB N="279" REF="278">
through a row of weeping dome&s;tics, not one of whom with dry eyes could &s;ee the hou&s;e bereft of &s;uch a mi&s;tre&s;s. She &s;poke to them all with kindne&s;s, and as much as was in her power with chearfulne&s;s: but the tone of her voice gave them little rea&s;on to think the concern at this journey was all their own.</P>
<P>She ordered her chai&s;e to drive round to the pew-opener's, and thence to the re&s;t of her immediate dependents. She &s;oon, however, regretted that &s;he had given her|&s;elf this ta&s;k; the affliction of the&s;e poor pen&s;ioners was clamorous, was almo&s;t heart-breaking; they could live, they &s;aid, no longer, they were ruined for ever; they &s;hould &s;oon be without bread to eat, and they might cry for help in vain, when their generous, their only benefactre&s;s was far away!</P>
<P>Cecilia made the kinde&s;t efforts to com|fort and encourage them, a&s;&s;uring them the very moment her own affairs were arranged, &s;he would remember them all, vi&s;it them her&s;elf, and contribute to their relief, with all the power &s;he &s;hould have left. No|thing, however, could con&s;ole them; they clung about her, almo&s;t took the hor&s;es from the chai&s;e, and conjured her not to de&s;ert tho&s;e who were &s;olely cheri&s;hed by her bounty!</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="279">
Nor was this all &s;he had to &s;uffer; the news of her intention to quit the county was now reported throughout the neigh|bourhood, and had &s;pread the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation among the poor in general, and the lower cla&s;s of her own tenants in parti|cular, and the road was &s;oon lined with women and children, wringing their hands and crying. They followed her carriage with &s;upplications that &s;he would return to them, mixing ble&s;&s;ings with their lamen|tations, and prayers for her happine&s;s with the bittere&s;t repinings at their own lo&s;s!</P>
<P>Cecilia was extremely affected; her li|beral and ever-ready hand was every other in&s;tant involuntarily &s;eeking her pur&s;e, which her many immediate expences, made her prudence as often check: and now fir&s;t &s;he felt the capital error &s;he had committed, in living con&s;tantly to the utmo&s;t extent of her income, without ever preparing, though &s;o able to have done it, again&s;t any unfor|tunate contingency.</P>
<P>When &s;he e&s;caped, at la&s;t, from receiv|ing any longer this painful tribute to her benevolence, &s;he gave orders to her man to ride forward, and &s;top at the Grove, that a preci&s;e and minute account of Mr. Monck|ton, might be the la&s;t, as it was now be|come the mo&s;t important, news &s;he &s;hould hear in Suffolk. This he did, when to her
<PB N="281" REF="280">
equal &s;urpri&s;e and delight, &s;he heard that he was &s;uddenly &s;o much better, there were hopes of his recovery.</P>
<P>Intelligence &s;o joyful made her amends for almo&s;t every thing; yet &s;he he&s;itated not in her plan of going abroad, as &s;he knew not where to be in England, and could not endure to hurry Delvile from his &s;ick mother, by acquainting him with her helple&s;s and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation. But &s;o revived were her &s;pirits by the&s;e unexpected tidings, that a gleam of brighte&s;t hope once more danced before her eyes, and &s;he felt her&s;elf invigorated with fre&s;h courage and new &s;trength, &s;ufficient to &s;upport her through all hard&s;hips and fatigues.</P>
<P>Spirits and courage were indeed much wanted for the enterprize &s;he had formed; but little u&s;ed to travelling, and having never been out of England, &s;he knew nothing of the route but by a general knowledge of geography, which, though it could guide her ea&s;t or we&s;t, could teach her nothing of foreign cu&s;toms, the preparations nece&s;&s;ary for the journey, the impo&s;itions &s;he &s;hould guard again&s;t, nor the various dangers to which &s;he might be expo&s;ed, from total ig|norance of the country through which &s;he had to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of the&s;e deficiencies for &s;uch an undertaking, &s;he deliberated without intermi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="282" REF="281">
how to obviate them. Yet &s;ome|times, when to the&s;e hazards, tho&s;e ari&s;ing from her youth and &s;ex were added, &s;he was upon the point of relinqui&s;hing her &s;cheme, as too perilous for execution, and re&s;olving to continue privately in London till &s;ome change happened in her affairs.</P>
<P>But though to every thing &s;he could &s;ugge&s;t, doubts and difficulties aro&s;e, &s;he had no friend to con&s;ult, nor could devi&s;e any means by which they might be termi|nated. Her maid was her only compa|nion, and Ralph, who had &s;pent almo&s;t his whole life in Suffolk, her only guard and attendant. To hire immediately &s;ome French &s;ervant, u&s;ed to travelling in his own country, &s;eemed the fir&s;t &s;tep &s;he had to take, and &s;o e&s;&s;ential, that no other ap|peared fea&s;ible till it was done. But where to hear of &s;uch a man &s;he could not tell, and to take one not well recommended, would be expo&s;ing her&s;elf to frauds and dangers innumerable.</P>
<P>Yet &s;o &s;low as Delvile travelled, from whom her la&s;t letter was &s;till dated O&s;tend, &s;he thought her&s;elf almo&s;t certain, could &s;he once reach the continent, of overtaking him in his route within a day or two of her landing.</P>
<P>The earne&s;t inclination with which this &s;cheme was &s;econded, made her every moment
<PB N="283" REF="282">
le&s;s willing to forego it. It &s;eemed the only harbour for her after the &s;torm &s;he had weathered, and the only refuge &s;he could properly &s;eek while thus hou&s;ele&s;s and helple&s;s. Even were Delvile in Eng|land, he had no place at pre&s;ent to offer her, nor could any thing be propo&s;ed &s;o unexceptionable as her living with Mrs. Delvile at Nice, till he knew his father's plea&s;ure, and, in a &s;eparate journey home, had arranged his affairs either for her re|turn, or her continuance abroad.</P>
<P>With what regret did &s;he now look back to the time when, in a di&s;tre&s;s &s;uch as this, &s;he &s;hould have applied for, and received the advice of Mr. Monckton as oracular! The lo&s;s of a coun&s;ellor &s;o long, &s;o impli|citly relied upon, lo&s;t to her al&s;o, only by his own intere&s;ted worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s, &s;he felt al|mo&s;t daily, for almo&s;t daily &s;ome intricacy or embarra&s;&s;ment made her mi&s;s his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance: and though glad, &s;ince &s;he found him &s;o unde&s;erving, that &s;he had e&s;caped the &s;nares he had &s;pread for her, &s;he griev|ed much that &s;he knew no man of hone&s;t character and equal abilities, that would care for her &s;ufficiently to &s;upply his place in her confidence.</P>
<P>As &s;he was &s;ituated at pre&s;ent, &s;he could think only of Mr. Belfield to whom &s;he could apply for any advice. Nor even to
<PB N="284" REF="283">
him was the application unexceptionable, the calumnies of Mr. Delvile &s;enior making it di&s;agreeable to her even to &s;ee him. But he was at once a man of the world and a man of honour; he was the friend of Morti|mer, who&s;e confidence in him was great, and his own behaviour had uniformly &s;hewn a re&s;pect far removed from impertinence or vanity, and a mind &s;uperior to being led to them by the influence of his gro&s;s mother. She had, indeed, when &s;he la&s;t quitted his hou&s;e, determined never to re-enter it; but determinations ha&s;ty or violent, are rarely ob&s;erved, becau&s;e rarely practicable; &s;he had promi&s;ed Henrietta to inform Mrs. Belfield whither &s;he was gone, and recon|cile her to the ab&s;ence &s;he &s;till hoped to make from home. She concluded, there|fore, to go to Portland-Street without de|lay, and enquire openly and at once whether, and when, &s;he might &s;peak with Mr. Bel|field; re&s;olving, if tormented again by any forward in&s;inuations, to rectify all mi&s;takes by acknowledging her marriage.</P>
<P>She gave directions accordingly to the po&s;t-boy and Ralph.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to her own lodgings while in town, as money was no longer unimport|ant to her, &s;he meant from the Befields to go to the Hills, by whom &s;he might be re|commended to &s;ome reputable and cheap
<PB N="285" REF="284">
place. To the Belfields, however, though very late when &s;he arrived in town, &s;he went fir&s;t, unwilling to lo&s;e a moment in promoting her &s;cheme of going abroad.</P>
<P>She left her maid in the chai&s;e, and &s;ent Ralph on to Mrs. Hill, with directions to endeavour immediately to procure her a lodging.</P>

<P>I would I had! thought Cecilia; who then explained her meaning; but in talk|ing of Mrs. Harrel, avoided all mention of Mr. Arnott, well fore&s;eeing that to hear &s;uch a man exi&s;ted, and was in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her daughter, would be &s;ufficient au|thority to her &s;anguine expectations, for de|pending upon a union between them, and reporting it among her friends.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance being made clear, Ce|cilia added, <Q REND="inline">"I could by no means have con&s;ented voluntarily to parting &s;o &s;oon with Mi&s;s Belfield, but that my own affairs call me at pre&s;ent out of the kingdom."</Q> And then, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Belfield, &s;he enquired if he could recommend to her a tru&s;ty foreign &s;ervant, who would be hired only for the time &s;he was to &s;pend abroad?</P>
<P>While Belfield was endeavouring to recollect

&s;ome &s;uch per&s;on, Mr. Hob&s;on eager|ly called out <Q REND="inline">"As to going abroad, madam, to be &s;ure you're to do as you like, for that, as I &s;ay, is the &s;oul of every thing; but el&s;e I can't &s;ay it's a thing I much approve; for my notion is this; here's a fine fortune, got as a man may &s;ay, out of the bowels of one's mother country, and this fine fortune, in default of male i&s;&s;ue, is obliged to come to a female, the law making no provi&s;o to the contrary. Well, this female, going into a &s;trange country, naturally takes with her this fortune, by rea&s;on it's the main article &s;he has to depend upon; what's the up&s;hot? why &s;he gets pilfered by a &s;et of &s;harpers that never &s;aw England in their lives, and that never lo&s;e &s;ight of her till &s;he has not a &s;ous in the world. But the hard&s;hip of the thing is this; when it's all gone, the lady can come back, but will the money come back?&mdash;No, you'll never &s;ee it again: now this is what I call being no true patriot."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Mr. Simkins,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Truth is truth, whether one &s;peaks it or not; and that, ma'am, I dare

<P><Q REND="inline">"I think, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Belfield, who waited their &s;ilence with great impatience, <Q REND="inline">"that I know ju&s;t &s;uch a man as you will require, and one upon who&s;e hone&s;ty I be|lieve you may rely."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's more,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"than I would take upon me to &s;ay for any <HI>Engli&s;hman!</HI> where you may meet with &s;uch a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> I won't be bold to &s;ay."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I take it as a great favour, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"that you have been &s;o complai&s;ant as to make me this vi&s;it to|night, for I was almo&s;t afraid you would not have done me the favour any more; for, to be &s;ure, when you was here la&s;t, things went a little unlucky: but I had no notion, for my part, who the old gentleman was till after he was gone, when Mr. Hob|&s;on told me it was old Mr. Delvile: though, &s;ure enough, I thought it rather upon the

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I think, indeed, if I may be &s;o free,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"it was rather petickeler of the gentleman; for, to be &s;ure, if he was &s;o over curious to hear about your private concerns, the genteel thing, if I may take the liberty for to differ, would have been for him to &s;ay, ma'am, &s;ays he, I'm come to a&s;k the favour of you ju&s;t to let me a little into your &s;on's goings on; and any thing, ma'am, you &s;hould take a fancy for to a&s;k me upon the return, why I &s;hall be very compliable, ma'am, &s;ays he, to giving of you &s;atisfaction."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"he would not have &s;aid &s;o much if you'd have gone down on your knees to a&s;k him.

&s;o out of humour, was my being &s;o unlucky as to &s;ay, before ever I knew who he was, that I had heard he was not over and above good-natured; for I &s;aw he did not &s;eem much to like it at the time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If he had done the generous thing,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"it would have been for him to have made the proffer of his &s;er|vices of his own free-will; and it's rather &s;urpri&s;eable to me he &s;hould never have thought of it; for what could be &s;o natural as for him to &s;ay, I &s;ee, ma'am, &s;ays he, you've got a very likely young gentleman here, that's a little out of ca&s;h, &s;ays he, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e, ma'am, &s;ays he, a place, or a pen&s;ion, or &s;omething in that &s;hape of life, would be no bad compliment, &s;ays he."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"If Mr. Belfield's home-vi&s;its are &s;o periodical,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"it mu&s;t be rather

<P><Q REND="inline">"A red-letter day?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good lack, madam, why have not you heard that my &s;on is turned book-keeper?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, much &s;urpri&s;ed, looked at Bel|field, who, colouring very high, and ap|parently much provoked by his mother's loquacity, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Had Mi&s;s Beverley not heard it even now, madam, I &s;hould pro|bably have lo&s;t with her no credit."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but far indeed from &s;urpri&s;ed, that you found your&s;elf

deceived by &s;uch &s;anguine expecta|tions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Deceived!"</Q> cried he, with energy, <Q REND="inline">"I was bewitched, I was infatuated! common &s;en&s;e was e&s;tranged by the &s;eduction of a chimera; my under&s;tanding was in a ferment from the ebullition of my imagination!

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"what|ever it has brought you back to, it has brought you back to no good! it's a hard ca&s;e, you mu&s;t needs think, madam, to a mother, to &s;ee a &s;on that might do what|ever he would, if he'd only &s;et about it, contenting him&s;elf with doing nothing but &s;cribble and &s;cribe one day, and when he gets tired of that, thinking of nothing better than ca&s;ting up two and two!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"what I have &s;een of the world is this; there's nothing methodizes a man but bu&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="296" REF="295">
If he's never &s;o much upon the &s;tilts, that's always a &s;ure way to bring him down, by rea&s;on he &s;oon finds there's nothing to be got by rhodomontading.

But as to argu|ing with gentlemen of that &s;ort, where's the good of it?

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am inclinable to think,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"that the young gentleman is rather of opinion to like plea&s;ure better than bu&s;ine&s;s; and, to be &s;ure, it's very excu&s;able of him, becau&s;e its more agreeabler.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, however,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia to Bel|field, <Q REND="inline">"your pre&s;ent &s;ituation is le&s;s irk|&s;ome to you?"</Q></P>

the under&s;tanding, nature's fir&s;t gift, &s;ub&s;er|vient to intere&s;t, that meane&s;t offspring of art!&mdash;when weary, li&s;tle&s;s, &s;piritle&s;s, to rack the head for invention, the memory for images, and the fancy for ornament and allu&s;ion; and when the mind is wholly oc|cupied by its own affections and affairs, to call forth all its faculties for foreign &s;ub|jects, unintere&s;ting di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, or fictitious incidents!&mdash;Heavens! what a life of &s;truggle between the head and the heart! how cruel, how unnatural a war between the intellects and the feelings!"</Q></P>

Why by bu&s;ine&s;s: for bu&s;ine&s;s is to money, what fine words are to a lady, a &s;ure road to &s;ucce&s;s. Now I don't mean by this to be cen&s;orious upon the ladies, being they have nothing el&s;e to go by, for as to examining if a man knows any thing of the world, and that, they have nothing whereby to judge, knowing nothing of it them|&s;elves.

every one be tru&s;ted according to their head|piece: and what I &s;ay is this: a lady in them ca&s;es is much to be pitied, for &s;he is obligated to take a man upon his own credit, which is tantamount to no credit at all, being what man will &s;peak an ill word of him&s;elf? you may as well expect a bad &s;hil|ling to cry out don't take me!

<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!&mdash;"</Q> exclaimed &s;he, invo|luntarily; but, checking her&s;elf as well as &s;he could, &s;he court&s;ied to Mrs. Belfield, unable to &s;peak to her, and avoiding even to look at Belfield, who re&s;pectfully hung back, &s;he ha&s;tened out of the room: ac|companied by Mrs. Belfield, who again be|gan the mo&s;t voluble and vulgar apologies for the intru&s;ion &s;he had met with.</P>
<P>Delvile al&s;o, after a moment's pau&s;e, fol|lowed, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Give me leave, madam, to &s;ee you to your carriage."</Q></P>

Cecilia then, notwith&s;tanding Mrs. Bel|field &s;till kept talking, could no longer re|frain &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Good heaven, what does all this mean?"</Q></P>

<P>The man waited no further orders, nor regarded the prohibition of Cecilia, who called out to him without cea&s;ing; but he would not li&s;ten to her till he got to the end of the &s;treet; he then &s;topt, and &s;he broke the &s;eal of her letter, and read, by the light of the lamps, enough to let her know that Delvile had written it upon the road from Dover to London, to acquaint her his mo|ther was now better, and had taken pity of his &s;u&s;pen&s;e and impatience, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his coming privately to England, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf fully about Mr. Monckton, communicate his marriage to his father, and give tho&s;e orders towards preparing for its being made public, which his unhappy precipitation in leaving the kingdom had prevented.</P>
<P>This letter, which, though written but a few hours before &s;he received it, was full of tenderne&s;s, gratitude, and anxiety for her happine&s;s, in&s;tantly convinced her that his &s;trange behaviour had been wholly the effect of a &s;udden impul&s;e of jealou&s;y; excited by &s;o unexpectedly finding her in town, at the very hou&s;e where his father had a&s;&s;ured him
<PB N="307" REF="306">
&s;he had an improper connexion, and alone, &s;o &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly, with the young man affirm|ed to be her favourite. He knew nothing of the ejectment, nothing of any rea&s;on for her leaving Suffolk, every thing had the &s;emblance of no motive but to indulge a private and criminal inclination.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts, which confu&s;edly, yet forcibly, ru&s;hed upon her mind, brought with them at once an excu&s;e for his con|duct, and an alarm for his danger; <Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t think,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I came to town only to meet Mr. Belfield!"</Q> then, opening the chai&s;e-door her&s;elf, &s;he jumpt out, and ran back into Portland-&s;treet, too impatient to argue with the po&s;tilion to return with her, and &s;topt not till &s;he came to Mrs. Belfield's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She knocked at the door with violence; Mrs. Belfield came to it her&s;elf; <Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q> cried &s;he, ha&s;tily entering as &s;he &s;poke, <Q REND="inline">"are the gentlemen?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lack-a-day! ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"they are both gone out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gone out?&mdash;where to?&mdash;which way?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I cant tell, ma'am, no more than you can; but I am &s;adly afraid they'll have a quarrel before they've done."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh heaven!"</Q> cried Cecilia, who now doubted not a &s;econd duel, <Q REND="inline">"tell me, &s;hew me, which way they went?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, to let you into the &s;ecret,"</Q>
<PB N="308" REF="307">
an&s;wered Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"only I beg you'll take no notice of it to my &s;on, but, &s;eeing them &s;o much out of &s;orts, I begged the favour of Mr. Simkins, as Mr. Hob|&s;on was gone out to his club, ju&s;t to follow them, and &s;ee what they were after."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was much rejoiced this caution had been taken, and determined to wait his return. She would have &s;ent for the chai&s;e to follow her; but Mrs. Belfield kept no &s;ervant, and the maid of the hou&s;e was em|ployed in preparing the &s;upper.</P>
<P>When Mr. Simkins came back, &s;he learnt, after various interruptions from Mrs. Belfield, and much delay from his own &s;lowne&s;s and circumlocution, that he had pur&s;ued the two gentlemen to the **** coffee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated not a moment in re&s;olving to follow them: &s;he feared the failure of any commi&s;&s;ion, nor did &s;he know whom to entru&s;t with one: and the danger was too urgent for much deliberation. She begged, therefore, that Mr. Simkins would walk with her to the chai&s;e; but hearing that the coffee-hou&s;e was another way, &s;he de&s;ired Mrs. Belfield to let the &s;ervant run and or|der it to Mrs. Roberts, in Fetter-lane, and then eagerly reque&s;ted Mr. Simkins to ac|company her on foot till they met with an hackney-coach.</P>
<P>They then &s;et out, Mr. Simkins feeling
<PB N="309" REF="308">
proud and happy in being allowed to at|tend her, while Cecilia, glad of any protec|tion, accepted his offer of continuing with her, even after &s;he met with an hackney|coach.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived at the coffee-hou&s;e, &s;he ordered the coachman to de&s;ire the ma&s;ter of it to come and &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>He came, and &s;he ha&s;tily called out, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, are two gentlemen here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here are &s;everal gentlemen here, ma|dam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes,&mdash;but are two upon any bu&s;i|ne&s;s&mdash;any particular bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Two gentlemen, madam, came about half an hour ago, and a&s;ked for a room to them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And where are they now?&mdash;are they up &s;tairs?&mdash;down &s;tairs?&mdash;where are they?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One of them went away in about ten minutes, and the other &s;oon after."</Q></P>
<P>Bitterly chagrined and di&s;appointed, &s;he knew not what &s;tep to take next; but, after &s;ome con&s;ideration, concluded upon obeying Delvile's own directions, and proceeding to St. James's-&s;quare, where alone, now, &s;he &s;eemed to have any chance of meeting with him. Gladly, however, &s;he &s;till con&s;ented to be accompanied by Mr. Simkins, for her dread of being alone, at &s;o late an hour, in an
<PB N="310" REF="309">
hackney-coach, was invincible. Whether Delvile him&s;elf had any authority for direct|ing her to his father's, or whether, in the per|turbation of his new-excited and agonizing &s;en&s;ations of jealou&s;y, he had forgotten that any authority was nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he knew not; nor could &s;he now intere&s;t her&s;elf in the doubt: a &s;econd &s;cene, &s;uch as had &s;o late|ly pa&s;&s;ed with Mr. Monckton, occupied all her thoughts: &s;he knew the too great pro|bability that the high &s;pirit of Belfield would di&s;dain making the explanation which Delvile in his pre&s;ent agitation might re|quire, and the con&s;equence of &s;uch a refu|&s;al mu&s;t almo&s;t inevitably be fatal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A PURSUIT.</HEAD>
<P>THE moment the porter came to the door, Cecilia eagerly called out from the coach, <Q REND="inline">"Is Mr. Delvile here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"but I believe he is engaged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh no matter for any engagement!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"open the door,&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;peak to him this moment!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you will plea&s;e to &s;tep into the par|lour, madam, I will tell his gentleman you are here; but he will be much di&s;plea&s;ed if he is di&s;turbed without notice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah heaven!"</Q> exclaimed &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what Mr. Delvile are you talking of?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My ma&s;ter, madam."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who had got out of the coach, now ha&s;tily returned to it, and was &s;ome time in too great agony to an&s;wer either the porter, who de&s;ired &s;ome me&s;&s;age, or the coachman, who a&s;ked whither he was to drive. To &s;ee Mr. Delvile, unprotected by his &s;on, and contrary to his orders, ap|peared to her in&s;upportable; yet to what
<PB N="312" REF="311">
place could &s;he go? where was &s;he likely to meet with Delvile? how could he find her if &s;he went to Mrs. Hill's? and in what other hou&s;e could &s;he at pre&s;ent claim ad|mittance?</P>
<P>After a little recovering from this cruel &s;hock, &s;he ventured, though in a faultering voice, to enquire whether young Mr. Del|vile had been there?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam,"</Q> the porter an&s;wered; <Q REND="inline">"we thought he was abroad, but he called ju&s;t now, and a&s;ked if any lady had been at the hou&s;e. He would not even &s;tay to go up to my ma&s;ter, and we have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> dared tell him of his arrival."</Q></P>
<P>This a little revived her; to hear that he had actually been enquiring for her, at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ured her of his &s;afety from any immedi|ate violence, and &s;he began to hope &s;he might now po&s;&s;ibly meet with him time enough to explain all that had pa&s;t in his ab&s;ence, and occa&s;ioned her &s;eemingly &s;trange and &s;u&s;picious &s;ituation at Belfield's. She compelled her&s;elf, therefore, to &s;ummon courage for &s;eeing his father, &s;ince, as he had directed her to the hou&s;e, &s;he conclud|ed he would return there to &s;eek her, when he had wandered el&s;e where to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>She then, though with much timidity and reluctance, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Mr. Delvile to entreat a moment's audience.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="312">
An an&s;wer was brought her that he &s;aw no company &s;o late at night.</P>
<P>Lo&s;ing now all dread of his reproaches, in her &s;uperior dread of mi&s;&s;ing Delvile, &s;he called out earne&s;tly to the man, <Q REND="inline">"Tell him, Sir, I be&s;eech him not to refu&s;e me! tell him I have &s;omething to communicate that requires his immediate attention!"</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ervant obeyed; but &s;oon returning, &s;aid his ma&s;ter de&s;ired him to acquaint her he was engaged every moment he &s;tayed in town, and mu&s;t po&s;itively decline &s;eeing her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Go to him again,"</Q> cried the harra&s;&s;ed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"a&s;&s;ure him I come not from my|&s;elf, but by the de&s;ire of one he mo&s;t va|lues: tell him I entreat but permi&s;&s;ion to wait an hour in his hou&s;e, and that I have no other place in the world whither I can go!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Delvile's own gentleman brought, with evident concern, the an&s;wer to this pe|tition; which was, that while the Honour|able Mr. Delvile was him&s;elf alive, he thought the de&s;ire of any other per&s;on con|cerning his hou&s;e, was taking with him a very extraordinary liberty; and that he was now going to bed, and had given orders to his &s;ervants to carry him no more me&s;&s;ages what&s;oever, upon pain of in&s;tant di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Cecilia now &s;eemed totally de&s;titute of
<PB N="314" REF="313">
all re&s;ource, and for a few dreadful minutes, gave her&s;elf up to utter de&s;pondency: nor, when &s;he recovered her pre&s;ence of mind, could &s;he form any better plan than that of waiting in the coach to watch the return of Delvile.</P>
<P>She told the coachman, therefore, to drive to a corner of the &s;quare, begging Mr. Simkins to have patience, which he pro|mi&s;ed with much readine&s;s, and endeavour|ed to give her comfort, by talking without ce&s;&s;ation.</P>
<P>She waited here near half an hour. She then feared the di&s;appointment of Delvile in not meeting her at fir&s;t, had made him conclude &s;he meant not to obey his directions, and had perhaps urged him to call again upon Belfield, whom he might fancy privy to her non-appearance. This was new horror to her, and &s;he re&s;olved at all ri&s;ks to drive to Portland-&s;treet, and enquire if Belfield him|&s;elf was returned home. Yet, le&s;t they &s;hould mutually be pur&s;uing each other all night, &s;he &s;topt again at Mr. Delvile's, and left word with the porter, that if young Mr. Delvile &s;hould come home, he would hear of the per&s;on he was enquiring for at Mrs. Roberts's in Fetter-lane. To Belfield's &s;he did not dare to direct him; and it was her intention, if there &s;he procured no new intelligence, to leave the &s;ame me&s;&s;age, and
<PB N="315" REF="314">
then go to Mrs. Roberts without further de|lay. To make &s;uch an arrangement with a &s;ervant who knew not her connection with his young ma&s;ter, was extremely repugnant to her; but the exigence was too urgent for &s;cruples, and there was nothing to which &s;he would not have con&s;ented, to prevent the fatal cata&s;trophe &s;he apprehended.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to Belfield's, not daring to enter the hou&s;e, &s;he &s;ent in Mr. Simkins, to de&s;ire that Mrs. Belfield would be &s;o good as to &s;tep to the coach door.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is your &s;on, madam,"</Q> &s;he cried, eager|ly, <Q REND="inline">"come home? and is any body with him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am; he has never once been acro&s;s the thre&s;hold &s;ince that gentleman took him out; and I am half out of my wits to think&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has that gentleman,"</Q> interrupted Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"been here any more?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, ma'am, that's what I was going to tell you; he came again ju&s;t now, and &s;aid&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;t now?&mdash;good heaven!&mdash;and which way is he gone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why he is after no good, I am afraid, for he was in a great pa&s;&s;ion, and would hardly hear any thing I &s;aid."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, pray an&s;wer me quick!&mdash;where, which way did he go?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="315">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, he a&s;ked me if I knew whither my &s;on was come from the ** coffee-hou&s;e; why, &s;ays I, I'm &s;ure I can't tell, for if it had not been for Mr. Simkins, I &s;hould not &s;o much as have known he ever went to the ** coffee-hou&s;e; however, I hope he a'n't come away, becau&s;e if he is, poor Mi&s;s Be|verley will have had all that trouble for no|thing; for &s;he's gone after him in a prodi|gious hurry; and upon my only &s;aying that, he &s;eemed quite be&s;ide him&s;elf, and &s;aid, if I don't meet with your &s;on at the ** coffee-hou&s;e my&s;elf, pray, when he comes in, tell him I &s;hall be highly obliged to him to call there; and then he went away, in as great a pet as ever you &s;aw."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia li&s;tened to this account with the utmo&s;t terror and mi&s;ery; the &s;u&s;picions of Delvile would now be aggravated, and the me&s;&s;age he had left for Belfield, would by him be regarded as a defiance. Again, however, to the ** coffee-hou&s;e &s;he in&s;tantly ordered the coach, an immediate explana|tion from her&s;elf &s;eeming the only po&s;&s;ible chance for preventing the mo&s;t horrible conclu&s;ion to this unfortunate and eventful evening.</P>
<P>She was &s;till accompanied by Mr. Sim|kins, and, but that &s;he attended to nothing he &s;aid, would not incon&s;iderably have been tormented by his conver&s;ation. She &s;ent
<PB N="317" REF="316">
him immediately into the coffee-room, to enquire if either of the gentleman were then in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He returned to her with a waiter, who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"One of them, madam, called again ju&s;t now, but he only &s;topt to write a note, which he left to be given to the gentleman who came with him at fir&s;t. He is but this moment gone, and I don't think he can be at the bottom of the &s;treet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh drive then, gallop after him!"</Q>&mdash;cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"coachman! go this mo|ment!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My hor&s;es are tired,"</Q> &s;aid the man, <Q REND="inline">"they have been out all day, and they will gallop no further, if I don't &s;top and give them a drink."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, too full both of hope and im|patience for this delay, forced open the door her&s;elf, and without &s;aying another word, jumped out of the carriage, with in|tention to run down the &s;treet; but the coachman immediately &s;eizing her, pro|te&s;ted &s;he &s;hould not &s;tir till he was paid.</P>
<P>In the utmo&s;t agony of mind at an hin|drance by which &s;he imagined Delvile would be lo&s;t to her perhaps for ever, &s;he put her hand in her pocket, in order to give up her pur&s;e for her liberty; but Mr. Simkins, who was making a tire&s;ome expo&s;tulation with the coachman, took it him&s;elf, and declaring
<PB N="318" REF="317">
he would not &s;ee the lady cheated, began a tedious calculation of his fare.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pay him any thing!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and let us be gone! an in&s;tant's delay may be fatal!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Simkins, too earne&s;t to conquer the coachman to attend to her di&s;tre&s;s, conti|nued his prolix harangue concerning a di&s;|puted &s;hilling, appealing to &s;ome gathering &s;pectators upon the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; while his adver&s;ary, who was far from &s;o|ber, &s;till held Cecilia, &s;aying the coach had been hired for the lady, and he would be paid by her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> cried the agitated Ce|cilia,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"give him my pur&s;e at once!&mdash;give him every thing he de&s;ires!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>The coachman, at this permi&s;&s;ion, en|crea&s;ed his demands, and Mr. Simkins, taking the number of his coach, prote&s;ted he would &s;ummons him to the Court of Con&s;cience the next morning. A gentle|man, who then came out of the coffee|hou&s;e, offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t the lady, but the coachman, who &s;till held her arm, &s;wore he would have his right.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let me go! let me pa&s;s!"</Q> cried &s;he, with encrea&s;ing eagerne&s;s and emotion; <Q REND="inline">"de|tain me at your peril!&mdash;relea&s;e me this moment!&mdash;only let me run to the end
<PB N="319" REF="318">
of the &s;treet,&mdash;good God! good Heaven! detain me not for mercy!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Simkins, humbly de&s;iring her not to be in ha&s;te, began a formal apology for his conduct; but the inebriety of the coach|man became evident; a mob was collect|ing; Cecilia, breathle&s;s with vehemence and terror, was encircled, yet &s;truggled in vain to break away; and the &s;tranger gentleman, prote&s;ting, with &s;undry com|pliments, he would him&s;elf take care of her, very freely &s;eized her hand.</P>
<P>This moment, for the unhappy Cecilia, teemed with calamity; &s;he was wholly overpowered; terror for Delvile, horror for her&s;elf, hurry, confu&s;ion, heat and fatigue, all a&s;&s;ailing her at once, while all means of repelling them were denied her, the attack was too &s;trong for her fears, feelings, and faculties, and her rea&s;on &s;uddenly, yet total|ly failing her, &s;he madly called out, <Q REND="inline">"He will be gone! he will be gone! and I mu&s;t follow him to Nice!"</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman now retreated; but Mr. Simkins, who was talking to the mob, did not hear her; and the coachman, too much intoxicated to perceive her ri&s;ing frenzy, per&s;i&s;ted in detaining her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am going to France!"</Q> cried &s;he, &s;till more wildly, <Q REND="inline">"why do you &s;top me? he
<PB N="320" REF="319">
will die if I do not &s;ee him, he will bleed to death!"</Q></P>
<P>The coachman, &s;till unmoved, began to grow very abu&s;ive; but the &s;tranger, touch|ed by compa&s;&s;ion, gave up his attempted gallantry, and Mr. Simkins, much a&s;toni&s;h|ed, entreated her not to be frightened: &s;he was, however, in no condition to li&s;ten to him; with a &s;trength hitherto unknown to her, &s;he forcibly di&s;engaged her&s;elf from her per&s;ecutors; yet her &s;en&s;es were wholly di&s;ordered; &s;he forgot her &s;ituation, her in|tention, and her&s;elf; the &s;ingle idea of Del|vile's danger took &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her brain, though all connection with its occa&s;ion was lo&s;t, and the moment &s;he was relea&s;ed, &s;he fervently cla&s;ped her hands, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"I will yet heal his wound, even at the ha|zard of my life!"</Q> and &s;pringing forward, was almo&s;t in&s;tantly out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Mr. Simkins now, much alarmed, and earne&s;tly calling after her, entered into a compromi&s;e with the coachman, that he might attend her; but the length of his negociation defeated its purpo&s;e, and before he was at liberty to follow her, all trace was lo&s;t by which he might have overtaken her. He &s;topt every pa&s;&s;enger he met to make enquiries, but though they led him on &s;ome way, they led him on in vain; and, after a u&s;ele&s;s and ill-managed pur&s;uit, he
<PB N="321" REF="320">
went quietly to his own home, determining to acqaint Mrs. Belfield with what had hap|pened the next morning.</P>
<P>Mean while the frantic Cecilia e&s;caped both pur&s;uit and in&s;ult by the velocity of her own motion. She called aloud upon Delvile as &s;he flew to the end of the &s;treet. No Delvile was there!&mdash;&s;he turned the corner; yet &s;aw nothing of him; &s;he &s;till went on, though unknowing whither, the di&s;traction of her mind every in&s;tant grow|ing greater, from the inflammation of fatigue, heat, and di&s;appointment. She was &s;poken to repeatedly; &s;he was even caught once or twice by her riding habit; but &s;he forced her&s;elf along by her own vehement rapidity, not hearing what was &s;aid, not heeding what was thought. Delvile, bleeding by the arm of Belfield, was the image before her eyes, and took &s;uch full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;en&s;es, that &s;till, as &s;he ran on, &s;he fancied it in view. She &s;carce touched the ground; &s;he &s;carce felt her own motion; &s;he &s;eemed as if endued with &s;upernatural &s;peed, gliding from place to place, from &s;treet to &s;treet; with no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any plan, and following no other direction than that of darting forward where-ever there was mo&s;t room, and turning back when &s;he met with any ob&s;truction; till quite &s;pent and exhau&s;ted, &s;he abruptly ran into a yet
<PB N="322" REF="321">
open &s;hop, where, breathle&s;s and panting, &s;he &s;unk upon the floor, and, with a look di&s;con&s;olate and helple&s;s, &s;at for &s;ome time without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>The people of the hou&s;e, concluding at fir&s;t &s;he was a woman of the town, were going roughly to turn her out; but &s;oon &s;eeing their mi&s;take, by the evident di&s;trac|tion of her air and manner, they enquired of &s;ome idle people who, late as it was, had followed her, if any of them knew who &s;he was, or whence &s;he came?</P>
<P>They could give no account of her, but &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was broke lo&s;e from Bedlam.</P>
<P>Cecilia then, wildly &s;tarting up, exclaim|ed, <Q REND="inline">"No, no,&mdash;I am not mad,&mdash;I am go|ing to Nice&mdash;to my hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She's quite crazy,"</Q> &s;aid the man of the hou&s;e, who was a Pawn-Broker; <Q REND="inline">"we had better get rid of her before &s;he grows mi&s;|chievous."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She's &s;omebody broke out from a pri|vate mad hou&s;e, I dare &s;ay,"</Q> &s;aid a man who had followed her into the &s;hop; <Q REND="inline">"and if you were to take care of her a little while, ten to one but you'll get a reward for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She's a gentlewoman, &s;ure enough,"</Q> &s;aid the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e &s;he's got &s;uch good things on."</Q></P>
<P>And then, under pretence of trying to find &s;ome direction to her upon a letter,
<PB N="323" REF="322">
or paper, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;earching her pockets: here, however, &s;he was di&s;ap|pointed in her expectations: her pur&s;e was in the cu&s;tody of Mr. Simkins, but neither her terror nor di&s;tre&s;s had &s;aved her from the daring dexterity of villainy, and her pockets, in the mob, had been rifled of what|ever el&s;e they contained. The woman there|fore he&s;itated &s;ome time whether to take charge of her or not: but being urged by the man who made the propo&s;al, and who &s;aid they might depend upon &s;eeing her &s;oon adverti&s;ed, as having e&s;caped from her keepers, they ventured to undertake her.</P>
<P>Mean while &s;he endeavoured again to get out, calling aloud upon Delvile to re&s;cue her, but &s;o wholly bereft of &s;en&s;e and recollection, &s;he could give no account who &s;he was, whence &s;he came, or whither &s;he wi&s;hed to go.</P>
<P>They then carried her up &s;tairs, and at|tempted to make her lie down upon a bed; but &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he refu&s;ed becau&s;e it was not of &s;traw, they de&s;i&s;ted; and, taking away the candle, locked the door, and all went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;erable condition, alone and raving, &s;he was left to pa&s;s the night! in the early part of it, &s;he called upon Delvile without intermi&s;&s;ion, be&s;eeching him to come to her defence in one moment, and deploring
<PB N="324" REF="323">
his death the next; but afterwards, her &s;trength being wholly exhau&s;ted by the&s;e various exertions and farigues, &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the floor, and lay for &s;ome minutes quite &s;till. Her head then began to grow cooler, as the fever into which terror and immoderate exerci&s;e had thrown her abated, and her memory recovered its functions.</P>
<P>This was, however, only a circum&s;tance of horror to her: &s;he found her&s;elf &s;hut up in a place of confinement, without light, without knowledge where &s;he was, and not a human being near her!</P>
<P>Yet the &s;ame returning rea&s;on which ena|bled her to take this view of her own &s;itua|tion, brought al&s;o to her mind that in which &s;he had left Delvile;&mdash;under all the perturbation of new-kindled jealou&s;y, ju&s;t calling upon Belfield,&mdash;Belfield, tenacious of his honour even more than him&s;elf,&mdash;to &s;atisfy doubts of which the very mention would be received as a challenge!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh yet, oh yet,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"let me fly and overtake them!&mdash;I may find them before morning, and to night it mu&s;t &s;urely have been too late for this work of death!"</Q></P>
<P>She then aro&s;e to feel for the door, and &s;ucceeded; but it was locked, and no effort &s;he could make enabled her to open it.</P>
<P>Her agony was un&s;peakable; &s;he called
<PB N="325" REF="324">
out with violence upon the people of the hou&s;e, conjured them to &s;et her at liberty, offered any reward for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and threatened them with a pro&s;ecution if de|tained.</P>
<P>Nobody, however, came near her: &s;ome &s;lept on notwith&s;tanding all the di&s;turbance &s;he could make, and others, though awak|ened by her cries, concluded them the rav|ings of a mad woman, and li&s;tened not to what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Her head was by no means in a condition to bear this violence of di&s;tre&s;s; every pul&s;e was throbbing, every vein &s;eemed bur&s;ting, her rea&s;on, &s;o lately returned, could not bear the repetition of &s;uch a &s;hock, and from &s;up|plicating for help with all the energy of feel|ing and under&s;tanding, &s;he &s;oon continued the cry from mere vehemence of di&s;trac|tion.</P>
<P>Thus dreadfully pa&s;&s;ed the night; and in the morning, when the woman of the hou&s;e came to &s;ee after her, &s;he found her raving with &s;uch frenzy, and de&s;peration, that her con&s;cience was perfectly at ea&s;e in the treatment &s;he had given her, being now firmly &s;atisfied &s;he required the &s;tricte&s;t con|finement.</P>
<P>She &s;till, however, tried to get away; talked of Delvile without ce&s;&s;ation, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be too late to &s;erve him, told the
<PB N="326" REF="325">
woman &s;he de&s;ired but to prevent murder, and repeatedly called out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh beloved of my heart! wait but a moment, and I will &s;natch thee from de&s;truction!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Wyers, this woman, now &s;ought no longer to draw from her whence &s;he came, or who &s;he was, but heard her frantic ex|clamations without any emotion, content|edly concluding that her madne&s;s was incur|able: and though &s;he was in a high fever, refu&s;ed all &s;u&s;tenance, and had every &s;ymp|tom of an alarming and dangerous malady, &s;he was fully per&s;uaded that her ca&s;e was that of decided in&s;anity, and had not any notion of temporary or accidental alienation of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>All &s;he could think of by way of indul|gence to her, was to bring her a quantity of &s;traw, having heard that mad people were fond of it; and putting it in a heap in one corner of the room, &s;he expected to &s;ee her eagerly fly to it.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, di&s;tracted as &s;he was, was eager for nothing but to e&s;cape, which was con&s;tantly her aim, alike when violent or when quiet. Mrs. Wyers, finding this, kept her clo&s;ely confined, and the door al|ways locked, whether ab&s;ent or pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. AN ENCOUNTER.</HEAD>
<P>TWO whole days pa&s;&s;ed thus; no en|quires reached Mrs. Wyers, and &s;he found in the news-papers no adverti&s;ement. Meanwhile Cecilia grew wor&s;e every mo|ment, ta&s;ted neither drink nor food, raved ince&s;&s;antly, called out twenty times in a breath, <Q REND="inline">"Where is he? which way is he gone?"</Q> and implored the woman by the mo&s;t pathetic remon&s;trances, to &s;ave her unhappy Delvile, <HI>dearer to her than life, more precious than peace or re&s;t!</HI></P>
<P>At other times &s;he talked of her mar|riage, of the di&s;plea&s;ure of his family, and of her own remor&s;e; entreated the woman not to betray her, and promi&s;ed to &s;pend the remnant of her days in the heavine&s;s of &s;orrow and contrition.</P>
<P>Again her fancy roved, and Mr Monck|ton took &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. She re|proached him for his perfidy, &s;he bewailed that he was ma&s;&s;acred, &s;he would not a mo|ment out-live him, and wildly declared <HI>her la&s;t remains &s;hould moulder in his hear&s;e!</HI> And

thus, though naturally and commonly of a &s;ilent and quiet di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he was now not a moment &s;till, for the irregular &s;tarts of a terrified and di&s;ordered imagination, were changed into the con&s;tant ravings of morbid delirium.</P>
<P>The woman, growing unea&s;y from her uncertainty of pay for her trouble, a&s;ked the advice of &s;ome of her friends what was proper for her to do; and they coun&s;elled her to put an adverti&s;ement into the papers her&s;elf the next morning.</P>

<P><PB N="329" REF="328">
This had but ju&s;t been &s;ent off, when Mr. Wyers, the man of the hou&s;e, coming up &s;tairs, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now we &s;hall have two of them, for here's the crazy old gentle|man below, that &s;ays he has ju&s;t heard in the neighbourhood of what has happened to us, and he de&s;ires to &s;ee the poor lady,"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's as well let him come up, then,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Wyers, <Q REND="inline">"for he goes to all &s;ort of places and people, and ten to one but he'll bu&s;tle about till he finds out who &s;he is."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wyers then went down &s;tairs to &s;end him up.</P>
<P>He came in&s;tantly. It was Albany, who in his vagrant rambles, having heard an unknown mad lady was at this pawn-bro|ker's, came, with his cu&s;tomary eagerne&s;s to vi&s;it and &s;erve the unhappy, to &s;ee what could be done for her</P>
<P>When he entered the room, &s;he was &s;it|ting upon the bed, her eyes earne&s;tly fixed upon the window, from which &s;he was pri|vately indulging a wi&s;h to make her e&s;cape. Her dre&s;s was in much di&s;order, her fine hair was di&s;hevelled, and the feathers of her riding hat were broken and half falling down, &s;ome &s;hading her face, others reach|ing to her &s;houlder.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor lady!"</Q> cried Albany, approaching
<PB N="330" REF="329">
her, <Q REND="inline">"how long has &s;he been in this &s;tate?"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;tarted at the &s;ound of a new voice, &s;he looked round,&mdash;but what was the a&s;|toni&s;hment of Albany to &s;ee who it was!&mdash;He &s;tept back,&mdash;he came forward,&mdash;he doubted his own &s;en&s;es,&mdash;he looked at her earne&s;tly,&mdash;he turned from her to look at the woman of the hou&s;e,&mdash;he ca&s;t his eyes round the room it&s;elf, and then, lifting up his hands, <Q REND="inline">"O &s;ight of woe!"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"the generous and good! the kind reliever of di&s;tre&s;s! the benign &s;u&s;tainer of mi&s;ery!&mdash;is <HI>This</HI> Cecilia!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, imperfectly recollecting, though not under&s;tanding him, &s;unk down at his feet, tremblingly called out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, if he is yet to be &s;aved, if already he is not mur|dered,&mdash;go to him! fly after him! you will pre&s;ently overtake him, he is only in the next &s;treet, I left him there my&s;elf, his &s;word drawn, and covered with human blood!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sweet powers of kindne&s;s and com|pa&s;&s;ion!"</Q> cried the old man, <Q REND="inline">"look upon this creature with pity! &s;he who rai&s;ed the depre&s;&s;ed, &s;he who cheared the unhappy! &s;he who&s;e liberal hand turned lamentations into joy! who never with a tearle&s;s eye could hear the voice of &s;orrow!&mdash;is <HI>This</HI> &s;he her&s;elf!&mdash;can <HI>This</HI> be Cecilia!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="330">
<Q REND="inline">"O do not wait to talk!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"go to him now, or you will never &s;ee him more! the hand of death is on him,&mdash;cold, clay-cold is its touch! he is breathing his la&s;t&mdash;Oh murdered Delvile! ma&s;&s;acred hu&s;|band of my heart! groan not &s;o piteou&s;ly! fly to him, and weep over him!&mdash;fly to him and pluck the poniard from his woun|ded bo&s;om!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh &s;ounds of angui&s;h and horror!"</Q> cried the melted morali&s;t, tears running quick down his rugged cheeks; <Q REND="inline">"melancholy in|deed is this &s;ight, humiliating to morality! &s;uch is human &s;trength, &s;uch human felici|ty!&mdash;weak as our virtues, frail as our guilty natures!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah,"</Q> cried &s;he, more wildly, <Q REND="inline">"no one will &s;ave me now! I am married, and no one will li&s;ten to me! ill were the au&s;pices under which I gave my hand! Oh it was a work of darkne&s;s, unacceptable and of|fen&s;ive! it has been &s;ealed, therefore, with blood, and to-morrow it will be &s;igned with murder!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor di&s;tracted creature!"</Q> exclaimed he, <Q REND="inline">"thy pangs I have felt, but thy innocence I have forfeited!&mdash;my own wounds bleed afre&s;h,&mdash;my own brain threatens new frenzy."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Then, &s;tarting up, <Q REND="inline">"Good woman,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"kindly attend her,&mdash;I will &s;eek
<PB N="332" REF="331">
out her friends, put her into bed, comfort, &s;ooth, compo&s;e her.&mdash;I will come to you again, and as &s;oon as I can."</Q></P>
<P>He then hurried away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh hour of joy!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"he is gone to re&s;cue him! oh bli&s;sful moment! he will yet be &s;natched from &s;laughter!"</Q></P>
<P>The woman lo&s;t not an in&s;tant in obey|ing the orders &s;he had received; &s;he was put into bed, and nothing was neglected, as far as &s;he had power and thought, to give a look of decency and attention to her accommodations.</P>
<P>He had not left them an hour, when Mary, the maid who had attended her from Suf|folk, came to enquire for her lady. Albany, who was now wandering over the town in &s;earch of &s;ome of her friends, and who en|tered every hou&s;e where he imagined &s;he was known, had ha&s;tened to that of Mrs. Hill the fir&s;t of any, as he was well ac|quainted with her obligations to Cecilia; there, Mary her&s;elf, by the directions which her lady had given Mrs. Belfield, had gone; and there, in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and unea&s;ine&s;s, had continued till Albany brought news of her.</P>
<P>She was &s;urpri&s;ed and afflicted beyond mea&s;ure, not only at the &s;tate of her mind, and her health, but to find her in a bed and an appartment &s;o un&s;uitable to her
<PB N="333" REF="332">
rank of life, and &s;o different to what &s;he had ever been accu&s;tomed. She wept bit|terly while &s;he enquired at the bed-&s;ide how her lady did, but wept &s;till more, when, without an&s;wering, or &s;eeming to know her, Cecilia &s;tarted up, and called out, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t be removed this moment! I mu&s;t go to St. James's-&s;quare,&mdash;if I &s;tay an in|&s;tant longer, the pa&s;&s;ing-bell will toll, and then how &s;hall I be in time for the fune|ral?"</Q></P>
<P>Mary, alarmed and amazed, turned ha&s;|tily from her to the woman of the hou&s;e, who calmly &s;aid, the lady was only in a ra|ving fit, and mu&s;t not be minded.</P>
<P>Extremely frightened at this intelligence, &s;he entreated her to be quiet and lie &s;till. But Cecilia grew &s;uddenly &s;o violent, that force only could keep her from ri&s;ing; and Mary, unu&s;ed to di&s;pute her commands, prepared to obey them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wyers now in her turn oppo&s;ed in vain; Cecilia was peremptory, and Mary became implicit, and, though not without much difficulty, &s;he was again dre&s;&s;ed in her riding habit. This operation over, &s;he moved towards the door, the temporary &s;trength of delirium giving her a hardine&s;s that combated fever, illne&s;s, fatigue, and feeblene&s;s. Mary, however aver&s;e and fearful, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and Mrs. Wyers,
<PB N="334" REF="333">
compelled by the obedience of her own &s;ervant, went before them to order a chair.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, felt her weakne&s;s when &s;he attempted to move down &s;tairs; her feet tottered, and her head became dizzy; &s;he leaned it again&s;t Mary, who called a|loud for more help, and made her &s;it down till it came. Her re&s;olution, however, was not to be altered; a &s;tubbornne&s;s, wholly foreign to her genuine character, now made her &s;tern and po&s;itive; and Mary, who thought her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion indi&s;pen&s;able, cried, but did not offer to oppo&s;e her.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Wyers both came up to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting her, and Mr. Wyers offered to carry her in his arms; but &s;he would not con&s;ent; when &s;he came to the bottom of the &s;tairs, her head grew wor&s;e, &s;he again lent it upon Mary, but Mr. Wyers was obliged to hold them both. She &s;till, however, was firm in her deter|mination, and was making another effort to proceed, when Delvile ru&s;hed ha&s;tily into the &s;hop.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t encountered Albany; who, knowing his acquaintance, though ignorant of his marriage with Cecilia, had informed him where to &s;eek her.</P>
<P>He was going to make enquiry if he was come to the right hou&s;e, when he perceived her,&mdash;feeble, &s;haking, leaning upon
<PB N="335" REF="334">
one per&s;on, and half carried by another!&mdash;he &s;tarted back, &s;taggered, ga&s;ped for breath,&mdash;but finding they were proceed|ing, advanced with trepidation, furiou&s;ly calling out, <Q REND="inline">"Hold! &s;top!&mdash;what is it you are doing? Mon&s;ters of &s;avage barba|rity, are you murdering my wife?"</Q></P>
<P>The well-known voice no &s;ooner &s;truck the ears of Cecilia, than in&s;tantly recollect|ing it, &s;he &s;creamed, and, in &s;uddenly en|deavouring to &s;pring forward, fell to the ground.</P>
<P>Delvile had vehemently advanced to catch her in his arms and &s;ave her fall, which her unexpected quickne&s;s had pre|vented her attendants from doing; but the &s;ight of her changed complection, and the wildne&s;s of her eyes and air, again made him &s;tart,&mdash;his blood froze through his veins, and he &s;tood looking at her, cold and almo&s;t petrified.</P>
<P>Her own recollection of him &s;eemed lo&s;t already; and exhau&s;ted by the fatigue &s;he had gone through in dre&s;&s;ing and coming down &s;tairs, &s;he remained &s;till and quiet, forgetting her de&s;ign of proceeding, and forming no new one for returning.</P>
<P>Mary, to whom, as to all her fellow &s;er|vants, the marriage of Cecilia had been known, before &s;he left the country, now

de&s;ired from Delvile directions what was to be done.</P>
<P>Delvile, &s;tarting &s;uddenly at this call from the deepe&s;t horror into the mo&s;t de&s;|perate rage, fiercely exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Inhuman wretches! unfeeling, execrable wretches, what is it you have done to her? how came &s;he hither?&mdash;who brought her? who dragged her?&mdash;by what infamous u&s;age has &s;he been &s;unk into this &s;tate?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, &s;ir, I don't know!"</Q> cried Mary.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Wyers, <Q REND="inline">"the lady&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Peace!"</Q> cried he, furiou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"I will not hear your fal&s;hoods!&mdash;peace, and be|gone!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Then, ca&s;ting him&s;elf upon the ground by her &s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"Oh my Cecilia,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"where ha&s;t thou been thus long? how have I lo&s;t thee? what dreadful calamity has befallen thee?&mdash;an&s;wer me, my love! rai&s;e your &s;weet head and an&s;wer me!&mdash;oh &s;peak!&mdash;&s;ay to me any thing; the bittere&s;t words will be mercy to this &s;i|lence?"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then, &s;uddenly looking up, cal|led out with great quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Who are you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who am I!"</Q> cried he, amazed and affrighted.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="336">
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be glad you would go away,"</Q> cried &s;he, in a hurrying manner, <Q REND="inline">"for you are quite unknown to me."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, uncon&s;cious of her in&s;anity, and attributing to re&s;entment this aver|&s;ion and repul&s;e, ha&s;tily moved from her, mournfully an&s;wering, <Q REND="inline">"Well indeed may you di&s;claim me, refu&s;e all forgivene&s;s, load me with hatred and reproach, and con&s;ign me to eternal angui&s;h! I have me|rited &s;everer puni&s;hment &s;till; I have be|haved like a mon&s;ter, and I am abhorrent to my&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, half ri&s;ing, and regarding him with mingled terror and anger, eager|ly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"If you do not mean to mangle and de&s;troy me, begone this in|&s;tant."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To mangle you!"</Q> repeated Delvile, &s;huddering, <Q REND="inline">"how horrible!&mdash;but I de|&s;erve it!&mdash;look not, however, &s;o terrified, and I will tear my&s;elf away from you. Suf|fer me but to a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing you from this place, and I will only watch you at a di&s;tance, and never &s;ee you more till you permit me to approach you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, why,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with a look of perplexity and impatience, <Q REND="inline">"will you not tell me your name, and where you come from?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="337">
<Q REND="inline">"Do you not know me?"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;truck with new horror; <Q REND="inline">"or do you on|ly mean to kill me by the que&s;tion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you bring me any me&s;&s;age from Mr. Monckton?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From Mr. Monckton?&mdash;no; but he lives and will recover."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought you had been Mr. Monck|ton your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Too cruel, yet ju&s;tly cruel Cecilia!&mdash;is then Delvile utterly renounced?&mdash;the guilty, the unhappy Delvile!&mdash;is he ca&s;t off for ever? have you driven him wholly from your heart? do you deny him even a place in your remembrance?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is your name, then, Delvile?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O what is it you mean! is it me or my name you thus di&s;own?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis a name,"</Q> cried &s;he, &s;itting up, <Q REND="inline">"I well remember to have heard, and once I loved it, and three times I called upon it in the dead of night. And when I was cold and wretched, I cheri&s;hed it; and when I was abandoned and left alone, I repeated it and &s;ung to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All-gracious powers!"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"her rea&s;on is utterly gone!"</Q> And, ha&s;ti|ly ri&s;ing, he de&s;perately added, <Q REND="inline">"what is death to this blow?&mdash;Cecilia, I am content to part with thee!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="338">
Mary now, and Mrs. Wyers, poured upon him eagerly an account of her illne&s;s, and in&s;anity, her de&s;ire of removal, and their inability to control her.</P>
<P>Delvile, however, made no an&s;wer; he &s;carce heard them: the deepe&s;t de&s;pair took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, and, root|ed to the &s;pot where he &s;tood, he contem|plated in dreadful &s;tillne&s;s the fallen and altered object of his be&s;t hopes and affec|tions; already in her faded cheeks and weakened frame, his agonizing terror read the quick impending de&s;truction of all his earthly happine&s;s! the &s;ight was too much for his fortitude, and almo&s;t for his under|&s;tanding; and when his woe became utter|able, he wrung his hands, and groaning a|loud, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Art thou gone &s;o &s;oon! my wife! my Cecilia! have I lo&s;t thee already?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, with utter in&s;en&s;ibility to what was pa&s;&s;ing, now &s;uddenly, and with a ra|pid yet continued motion, turned her head from &s;ide to &s;ide, her eyes wildly glaring, yet apparently regarding nothing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dreadful! dreadful!"</Q> exclaimed Del|vile, <Q REND="inline">"what a &s;ight is this!"</Q> and turning from her to the people of the hou&s;e, he angrily &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"why is &s;he here upon the floor? could you not even allow her a bed?
<PB N="340" REF="339">
Who attends her? Who waits upon her? Why has nobody &s;ent for help?&mdash;Don't an&s;wer me,&mdash;I will not hear you, fly this moment for a phy&s;ician,&mdash;bring two, bring three&mdash;bring all you can find!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, &s;till looking from Cecilia, who&s;e &s;ight he could no longer &s;upport, he con|&s;ulted with Mary whither &s;he &s;hould be conveyed: and, as the night was far ad|vanced, and no place was prepared for her el&s;ewhere, they &s;oon agreed that &s;he could only be removed up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Delvile now attempted to carry her in his arms; but trembling and un&s;teady, he had not &s;trength to &s;u&s;tain her; yet not enduring to behold the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t, he conjured them to be careful and gentle, and, committing her to their tru&s;t, ran out him&s;elf for a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Cecilia re&s;i&s;ted them with her utmo&s;t power, imploring them not to bury her alive, and averring &s;he had received intel|ligence they meant to entomb her with Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P>They put her, however, to bed, but her raving grew &s;till more wild and ince&s;&s;ant.</P>
<P>Delvile &s;oon returned with a phy&s;ician, but had not courage to attend him to her room. He waited for him at the foot of the &s;tairs, where, ha&s;tily &s;topping him,
<PB N="341" REF="340">
<Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;ir,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"is it not all over? is it not impo&s;&s;ible &s;he can live?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She is very ill, indeed, &s;ir,"</Q> he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"but I have given directions which perhaps&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Perhaps!</HI>"</Q> interrupted Delvile, &s;hud|dering; <Q REND="inline">"do not &s;tab me with &s;uch a word!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She is very delirious,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"but as her fever is very high, that is not &s;o material. If the orders I have given take effect, and the fever is got under, all the re&s;t will be well of cour&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>He then went away; leaving Delvile as much thunder&s;truck by an&s;wers &s;o alarm|ing, as if he had con&s;ulted him in full hope, and without even &s;u&s;picion of her danger.</P>
<P>The moment he recovered from this &s;hock, he flew out of the hou&s;e for more advice.</P>
<P>He returned and brought with him two phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>They confirmed the directions already given, but would pronounce nothing de|ci&s;ively of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Delvile, half mad with the acutene&s;s of his mi&s;ery, charged them all with want of &s;kill, and wrote in&s;tantly into the coun|try for Dr. Ly&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="341">
He went out him&s;elf in &s;earch of a me&s;&s;enger to ride off expre&s;s, though it was midnight, with his letter; and then, returning, he was ha&s;tening to her room, but, while yet at the door, hearing her &s;till raving, his horror conquered his eagerne&s;s, and, hurrying down &s;tairs, he &s;pent the remnant of the long and &s;eemingly endle&s;s night in the &s;hop.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A TRIBUTE.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN-WHILE Cecilia went thro' very &s;evere di&s;cipline, &s;ometimes &s;trongly oppo&s;ing it, at other times &s;carce &s;en&s;ible what was done to her.</P>
<P>The whole of the next day pa&s;&s;ed in much the &s;ame manner, neither did the next night bring any vi&s;ible alteration. She had now nur&s;es and attendants even more than &s;ufficient, for Delvile had no relief but from calling in more help. His terror of again &s;eeing her encrea&s;ed with his forbear|ance; the interview which had already pa&s;t had almo&s;t torn him a&s;under, and lo&s;ing all courage for attempting to enter her room, he now &s;pent almo&s;t all his time upon the &s;tairs which led to it. Whenever &s;he was &s;till, he &s;eated him&s;elf at her cham|ber door, where, if he could hear her breathe or move, a &s;udden hope of her re|covery gave to him a momentary exta&s;y that recompen&s;ed all his &s;ufferings. But the in&s;tant &s;he &s;poke, unable to bear the &s;ound of &s;o loved a voice uttering nothing
<PB N="344" REF="343">
but the incoherent ravings of lightheaded|ne&s;s, he ha&s;tened down &s;tairs, and flying out of the hou&s;e, walked in the neighbour|ing &s;treets, till he could again gather cou|rage to enquire or to li&s;ten how &s;he went on.</P>
<P>The following morning, however, Dr. Ly&s;ter came, and every hope revived. He flew to embrace him, told him in&s;tantly his marriage with Cecilia, and be&s;ought him by &s;ome &s;uperior effort of his extraor|dinary abilities to &s;ave him the di&s;traction of her lo&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My good friend,"</Q> cried the worthy Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"what is this you a&s;k of me? and how can this poor young lady her&s;elf want advice more than you do? Do you think the&s;e able phy&s;icians actually upon the &s;pot, with all the experience of full practice in London to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;kill, want a petty Doctor out of the country to come and teach them what is right?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have more reliance upon you,"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"than upon the whole faculty; come, therefore, and pre&s;cribe for her,&mdash;take &s;ome new cour&s;e"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible, my good Sir, impo&s;&s;ible! I mu&s;t not lo&s;e my wits from vanity, be|cau&s;e you have lo&s;t yours from affliction. I could not refu&s;e to come to you when you wrote to me with &s;uch urgency, and I will
<PB N="345" REF="344">
now go and &s;ee the young lady, as a <HI>friend,</HI> with all my heart. I am &s;orry for you at my &s;oul, Mr. Mortimer! She is a lovely young creature, and has an under&s;tanding, for her years and &s;ex, unequalled."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never mention her to me!"</Q> cried the impatient Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear it! Go up to her, dear Doctor, and if you want a con&s;ultation, &s;end, if you plea&s;e, for every phy&s;ician in town."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter de&s;ired only that tho&s;e who had already attended might be &s;ummoned; and then, giving up to his entreaties the accu&s;tomed ceremonial of waiting for them, he went to Cecilia.</P>
<P>Delvile did not dare accompany him; and &s;o well was he acquainted with his plainne&s;s and &s;incerity, that though he ex|pected his return with eagerne&s;s, he no &s;ooner heard him upon the &s;tairs, than fear|ing to know his opinion, he ha&s;tily &s;natch|ed up his hat, and ru&s;hed vehemently out of the hou&s;e to avoid him.</P>
<P>He continued to walk about the &s;treets, till even the dread of ill news was le&s;s hor|rible to him than this voluntary &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and then he returned to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He found Dr. Ly&s;ter in a &s;mall back parlour, which Mrs. Wyers, finding &s;he &s;hould now be well paid, had appropriated for Delvile's u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="345">
Delvile, putting his hand upon the Doc|tor's &s;houlder, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear Doctor Ly&s;ter, <HI>you,</HI> &s;till, I hope"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would I could make you ea&s;y!"</Q> in|terrupted the Doctor; <Q REND="inline">"yet, if you are ra|tional, one comfort, at all events, I can give you; the cri&s;is &s;eems approaching, and either &s;he will recover, or before to-morrow morning"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't go on, Sir!"</Q> cried Delvile, with mingled rage and horror, <Q REND="inline">"I will not have her days limited! I &s;ent not for you to give me &s;uch an account!"</Q></P>
<P>And again he flew out of the hou&s;e, leaving Dr. Ly&s;ter unaffectedly concerned for him, and too kind-hearted and too wi&s;e to be offended at the inju&s;tice of immode|rate &s;orrow.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, however, from the ef|fect rather of de&s;pair than philo&s;ophy, Del|vile grew more compo&s;ed, and waited upon Dr. Ly&s;ter to apologize for his behaviour. He received his hearty forgivene&s;s, and prevailed upon him to continue in town till the whole was decided.</P>
<P>About noon, Cecilia, from the wilde&s;t rambling and mo&s;t perpetual agitation, &s;unk &s;uddenly into a &s;tate of &s;uch utter in&s;en&s;ibi|lity, that &s;he appeared uncon&s;cious even of her exi&s;tence; and but that &s;he breathed, &s;he might already have pa&s;&s;ed for being dead.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="346">
When Delvile heard this, he could no longer endure even his po&s;t upon the &s;tairs; he &s;pent his whole time in wandering about the &s;treets, or &s;topping in Dr. Ly&s;ter's par|lour to enquire if all was over.</P>
<P>That humane phy&s;ician, not more alarm|ed at the danger of Cecilia, than grieved at the &s;ituation of Delvile, thought the pre&s;ent fearful cri&s;is at lea&s;t offered an opportunity of reconciling him with his father. He waited, therefore, upon that gentleman in St. James's-&s;quare, and openly informed him of the dangerous &s;tate of Cecilia, and the mi&s;ery of his &s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, though he would gladly, to have annulled an alliance he held di&s;grace|ful to his family, have received intelligence that Cecilia was no more, was yet extremely di&s;concerted to hear of &s;ufferings to which his own refu&s;al of an a&s;ylum he was con&s;ci|ous had largely contributed; and after a haughty &s;truggle between tenderne&s;s and wrath, he begged the advice of Dr. Ly&s;ter how his &s;on might be drawn from &s;uch a &s;cene.</P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter, who well knew Delvile was too de&s;perate to be tractable, propo&s;ed &s;ur|pri&s;ing him into an interview by their re|turning together: Mr. Delvile, however apprehen&s;ive and relenting, conceded mo&s;t unwillingly to a mea&s;ure he held beneath
<PB N="348" REF="347">
him, and, when he came to the &s;hop, could &s;carce be per&s;uaded to enter it. Mortimer, at that time, was taking a &s;olitary ramble; and Dr. Ly&s;ter, to complete the work he had begun of &s;ubduing the hard pride of his father, contrived, under pretence of waiting for him, to conduct him to the room of the invalide.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, who knew not whither he was going, at fir&s;t &s;ight of the bed and the attendants, was ha&s;tily retreating; but the changed and livid face of Cecilia caught his eye, and, &s;truck with &s;udden con&s;ternation, he involuntarily &s;topt.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Look at the poor young lady!"</Q> cried Dr. Ly&s;ter; <Q REND="inline">"can you wonder a &s;ight &s;uch as this &s;hould make Mr. Mortimer forget every thing el&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P>She was wholly in&s;en&s;ible, but perfectly quiet; &s;he &s;eemed to di&s;tingui&s;h nothing, and neither &s;poke nor moved.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile regarded her with the utmo&s;t horror: the refuge he &s;o implacably refu&s;ed her on the night when her intellects were di&s;ordered, he would now gladly have of|fered at the expence of almo&s;t &s;imilar &s;uf|ferings, to have relieved him&s;elf from tho&s;e ri&s;ing pangs which called him author of this &s;cene of woe. His pride, his pomp, his ancient name, were now &s;unk in his e&s;|timation; and while he con&s;idered him&s;elf
<PB N="349" REF="348">
the de&s;troyer of this unhappy young crea|ture, he would have &s;acrificed them all to have called him&s;elf her protector. Little is the boa&s;t of in&s;olence when it is analy&s;ed by the con&s;cience! bitter is the agony of &s;elf|reproach, where mi&s;ery follows hardne&s;s of heart! yet, when the fir&s;t painful a&s;toni&s;h|ment from her &s;ituation abated, the remor&s;e &s;he excited being far &s;tronger than the pity, he gave an angry glance at Dr. Ly&s;ter for betraying him into &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, and ha&s;tily left the room.</P>
<P>Delvile, who was now impatiently wait|ing to &s;ee Dr. Ly&s;ter in the little parlour, alarmed at the &s;ound of a new &s;tep upon the &s;tairs, came out to enquire who had been admitted. When he &s;aw his father, he &s;hrunk back; but Mr. Delvile, no longer &s;upported by pride, and unable to recover from the &s;hock he had ju&s;t received, caught him in his arms, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Oh come home to me, my &s;on! this is a place to de&s;troy you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Sir,"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"think not of me now!&mdash;you mu&s;t &s;hew me no kind|ne&s;s; I am not in a &s;tate to bear it!"</Q> And, forcibly breaking from him, he hurried out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, all the father awakened in his bo&s;om, &s;aw his departure with more dread than anger; and returned him&s;elf to
<PB N="350" REF="349">
St. James's-&s;quare, tortured with parental fears, and &s;tung by per&s;onal remor&s;e, la|menting his own inflexibility, and pur&s;ued by the pale image of Cecilia.</P>
<P>She was &s;till in this uncon&s;cious &s;tate, and apparently as free from &s;uffering as from enjoyment, when a new voice was &s;uddenly heard without, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Oh where is &s;he? where is &s;he? where is my dear Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q> and Henrietta Belfield ran wild|ly into the room.</P>
<P>The adverti&s;ement in the news-papers had at once brought her to town, and direct|ed her to the hou&s;e: the mention that the lo&s;t lady <HI>talked much of a per&s;on by the name of Delvile,</HI> &s;truck her in&s;tantly to mean Cecilia; the de&s;cription corre&s;ponded with this idea, and the account of the dre&s;s confirmed it: Mr. Arnott, equally terrified with her&s;elf, had therefore lent her his chai&s;e to learn the truth of this conjecture, and &s;he had tra|velled all night.</P>
<P>Flying up to the bed&s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"Who is this?"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"this is not Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q> and then &s;creaming with unre&s;trained horror, <Q REND="inline">"Oh mercy! mercy!"</Q> &s;he called out, <Q REND="inline">"yes, it is indeed! and nobody would know her!&mdash;her own mother would not think her her child!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t come away, Mi&s;s Belfield,"</Q> &s;aid Mary, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t indeed,&mdash;the doc|tors all &s;ay my lady mu&s;t not be di&s;turbed."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="350">
<Q REND="inline">"Who &s;hall take me away?"</Q> cried &s;he, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"nobody Mary! not all the doc|tors in the world! Oh &s;weet Mi&s;s Be|verly! I will lie down by your &s;ide,&mdash;I will never quit you while you live,&mdash;and I wi&s;h, I wi&s;h I could die to &s;ave your precious life!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, leaning over her, and wringing her hands, <Q REND="inline">"Oh I &s;hall break my heart,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ee her in this condition! Is this the &s;o happy Mi&s;s Beverley, that I thought every body born to give joy to? the Mi&s;s Beverley that &s;eemed queen of the whole world! yet &s;o good and &s;o gentle, &s;o kind to the meane&s;t per&s;on! excu&s;ing every body's faults but her own, and telling them how they might mend, and trying to make them as good as her&s;elf!&mdash;Oh who would know her! who would know her! what have they done to you, my beloved Mi&s;s Beverley? how have they altered and disfi|gured you in this wicked and barbarous manner?"</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this &s;imple yet pathetic te&s;timony, to the worth and various excel|lencies of Cecilia, Dr. Ly&s;ter came into the room. The women all flocked around him, except Mary, to vindicate them&s;elves from any &s;hare in permitting this new comer's entrance and behaviour; but Mary only told him who &s;he was, and &s;aid, that if her lady was well enough to know her, there

was nobody &s;he was certain &s;he would have been &s;o glad to &s;ee.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Young lady,"</Q> &s;aid the doctor, <Q REND="inline">"I would advi&s;e you to walk into another room till you are a little more compo&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Every body, I find, is for hurrying me away;"</Q> cried the &s;obbing Henrietta, who&s;e hone&s;t heart &s;welled with its own af|fectionate integrity; <Q REND="inline">"but they might all &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble, for go I will not!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is very wrong,"</Q> &s;aid the doctor, <Q REND="inline">"and mu&s;t not be &s;uffered: do you call it friend&s;hip to come about a &s;ick per&s;on in this manner?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh my Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> cried Henri|etta, <Q REND="inline">"do you hear how they all upbraid me? how they all want to force me away from you, and to hinder me even from look|ing at you! Speak for me, &s;weet lady! &s;peak for me your&s;elf! tell them the poor Henrietta will not do you any harm; tell them &s;he only wi&s;hes ju&s;t to &s;it by you, and to &s;ee you!&mdash;I will hold by this dear hand,&mdash;I will cling to it till the la&s;t minute; and you will not, I know you will not, give orders to have it taken away from me!"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter, though his own good na|ture was much affected by this fond &s;or|row, now half angrily repre&s;ented to her the impropriety of indulging it: but Henrietta,

unu&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;e or repre&s;s her feelings, grew only the more violent, the more &s;he was convinced of Cecilia's danger: <Q REND="inline">"Oh look but at her,"</Q> &s;he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"and take me from her if you can! &s;ee how her &s;weet eyes are fixed! look but what a change in her complexion!&mdash;She does not &s;ee me, &s;he does not know me,&mdash;&s;he does not hear me! her hand &s;eems quite lifele&s;s already, her face is all fallen away!&mdash;Oh that I had died twenty deaths before I had lived to &s;ee this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ight!&mdash;poor wretch|ed Henrietta, thou ha&s;t now no friend left in the world! thou may&s;t go and lie down in &s;ome corner, and no one will come and &s;ay to thee a word of comfort!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This mu&s;t not be!"</Q> &s;aid Dr. Ly&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t take her away."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall not!"</Q> cried &s;he, de&s;perately, <Q REND="inline">"I will &s;tay with her till &s;he has breathed her la&s;t, and I will &s;tay with her &s;till longer! and if &s;he was to &s;peak to you at this moment, &s;he would tell you that &s;he cho&s;e it. She loved the poor Henrietta, and loved to have her near her; and when &s;he was ill, and in much di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he never once bid me leave her room. Is it not true, my &s;weet Mi&s;s Beverley? do you not know it to be true? Oh look not &s;o dread|fully! turn to your unhappy Henrietta; &s;weete&s;t, be&s;t of ladies! will you not &s;peak
<PB N="354" REF="353">
to her once more? will you not &s;ay to her one &s;ingle word?"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter now grew very angry, and telling her &s;uch violence might have fatal con&s;equences, frightened her into more or|der, and drew her away him&s;elf. He had then the kindne&s;s to go with her into ano|ther room, where, when her fir&s;t vehemence was &s;pent, his remon&s;trances and rea&s;oning brought her to a &s;en&s;e of the danger &s;he might occa&s;ion, and made her promi&s;e not to return to the room till &s;he had gained &s;trength to behave better.</P>
<P>When Dr. Ly&s;ter went again to Delvile, he found him greatly alarmed by his long &s;tay; he communicated to him briefly what had pa&s;&s;ed, and coun&s;elled him to avoid en|crea&s;ing his own grief by the &s;ight of what was &s;uffered by this unguarded and ardent girl. Delvile readily a&s;&s;ented, for the weight of his own woe was too heavy to bear any addition.</P>
<P>Henrietta now, kept in order by Dr. Ly&s;ter, contented her&s;elf with only &s;itting upon the bed, without attempting to &s;peak, and with no other employment than alter|nately looking at her &s;ick friend, and cover|ing her &s;treaming eyes with her handker|chief; from time to time quitting the room wholly, for the relief of &s;obbing at liberty and aloud in another.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="354">
But, in the evening, while Delvile and Dr. Ly&s;ter were taking one of their melan|choly rambles, a new &s;cene was acted in the apartment of the &s;till &s;en&s;ele&s;s Cecilia. Al|bany &s;uddenly made his entrance into it, accompanied by three children, two girls and one boy, from the ages of four to &s;ix, neatly dre&s;&s;ed, clean, and healthy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"See here!"</Q> cried he, as he came in, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ee here what I have brought you! rai&s;e, rai&s;e your languid head, and look this way! you think me rigid,&mdash;an enemy to plea&s;ure, au&s;tere, har&s;h, and a forbidder of joy: look at this &s;ight, and &s;ee the contrary! who &s;hall bring you comfort, joy, plea&s;ure, like this? three innocent children, clothed and fed by your bounty!"</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta and Mary, who both knew him well, were but little &s;urpri&s;ed at any thing he &s;aid or did, and the nur&s;es pre&s;um|ed not to interfere but by whi&s;pers.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, ob&s;erved nothing that pa&s;&s;ed; and Albany, &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hed, approached nearer to the bed; <Q REND="inline">"Wilt thou not &s;peak?"</Q> he cried.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She can't, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid one of the women; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he has been &s;peechle&s;s many hours."</Q></P>
<P>The air of triumph with which he had entered the room was now changed into di&s;|appointment and con&s;ternation. For &s;ome minutes he thoughtfully and &s;orrowfully
<PB N="356" REF="355">
contemplated her, and then, with a deep &s;igh, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How will the poor rue this day!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, turning to the children, who, awed by this &s;cene, were quiet from terror, <Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"ye helple&s;s babes, ye know not what you have lo&s;t: pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly we came; unheeded we mu&s;t re|turn! I brought you to be &s;een by your benefactre&s;s, but &s;he is going where &s;he will find many &s;uch."</Q></P>
<P>He then led them away; but, &s;uddenly coming back, <Q REND="inline">"I may &s;ee her, perhaps, no more! &s;hall I not, then, pray for her? Great and aweful is the change &s;he is mak|ing; what are human revolutions, how piti|ful, how in&s;ignificant, compared with it?&mdash;Come, little babies, come; with gifts has &s;he often ble&s;&s;ed <HI>you,</HI> with wi&s;hes ble&s;s <HI>her!</HI> Come, let us kneel round her bed; let us all pray for her together; lift up your innocent hands, and for all of you I will &s;peak."</Q></P>
<P>He then made the children obey his in|junctions, and having knelt him&s;elf, while Henrietta and Mary in&s;tantly did the &s;ame, <Q REND="inline">"Sweet flower!"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"untimely cropt in years, yet in excellence mature! early decayed in mi&s;ery, yet fragrant in in|nocence! Gentle be thy exit, for un&s;ullied have been thy days; brief be thy pains, for
<PB N="357" REF="356">
few have been thy offences! Look at her &s;weet babes, and bear her in your remem|brance; often will I vi&s;it you and revive the &s;olemn &s;cene. Look at her ye, al&s;o, who are nearer to your end&mdash;Ah! will you bear it like her!"</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed; and the nur&s;es and Mrs. Wyers, &s;truck by this call, and moved by the general example, crept to the bed, and dropt on their knees, almo&s;t involuntarily.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She departs,"</Q> re&s;umed Albany, <Q REND="inline">"the envy of the world! while yet no guilt had &s;eized her &s;oul, and no remor&s;e had marred her peace. She was the hand-maid of cha|rity, and pity dwelt in her bo&s;om! her mouth was never opened but to give com|fort; her foot&s;teps were followed by ble&s;|&s;ings! Oh happy in purity, be thine the &s;ong of triumph!&mdash;&s;oftly &s;halt thou &s;ink to temporary &s;leep,&mdash;&s;ublimely &s;halt thou ri&s;e to life that wakes for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>He then got up, took the children by their little hands, and went away.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A TERMINATION.</HEAD>
<P>DR. Ly&s;ter and Delvile met them at the entrance into the hou&s;e. Extremely alarmed le&s;t Cecilia had received any di|&s;turbance, they both ha&s;tened up &s;tairs, but Delvile proceeded only to the door. He &s;topt there and li&s;tened; but all was &s;i|lent: the prayers of Albany had &s;truck an awe into every one; and Dr. Ly&s;ter &s;oon returned to tell him there was no altera|tion in his patient.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And he has not di&s;turbed her?"</Q> cried Delvile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think, then,"</Q> &s;aid he, advancing, though trembling, <Q REND="inline">"I will yet &s;ee her once more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, Mr. Mortimer,"</Q> cried the doctor, <Q REND="inline">"why &s;hould you give your&s;elf &s;o unnece&s;&s;ary a &s;hock?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;hock,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"is over!&mdash;tell me, however, is there any chance I may hurt <HI>her?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not; I do not think, ju&s;t now, &s;he will perceive you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="358">
<Q REND="inline">"Well, then,&mdash;I may grieve, perhaps, hereafter, that once more&mdash;that one glance!"</Q>&mdash;He &s;topt, irre&s;olute: the doctor would again have di&s;&s;uaded him, but, after a little he&s;itation, he a&s;&s;ured him he was prepared for the wor&s;t, and forced him&s;elf into the room.</P>
<P>When again, however, he beheld Ceci|lia,&mdash;&s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;peechle&s;s, motionle&s;s, her features void of all expre&s;&s;ion, her cheeks without colour, her eyes without meaning,&mdash;he &s;hrunk from the &s;ight, he leant upon Dr. Ly&s;ter, and almo&s;t groaned aloud.</P>
<P>The doctor would have conducted him out of the apartment; but, recovering from this fir&s;t agony, he turned again to view her, and ca&s;ting up his eyes, fervently eja|culated, <Q REND="inline">"Oh merciful powers! Take, or de&s;troy her! let her not linger thus, rather let me lo&s;s her for ever!&mdash;Oh far rather would I &s;ee her dead, than in this dreadful condition!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, advancing to the bed &s;ide, and yet more earne&s;tly looking at her, <Q REND="inline">"I pray not now,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"for thy life! inhumanly as I have treated thee, I am not yet &s;o har|dened as to wi&s;h thy mi&s;ery lengthened: no; quick be thy re&s;toration, or &s;hort as pure thy pa&s;&s;age to eternity!&mdash;Oh my Ceci|lia! lovely, however altered! &s;weet even in the arms of death and in&s;anity! and dearer
<PB N="360" REF="359">
to my tortured heart in this calamitous &s;tate, than in all thy pride of health and beauty!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt, and turned from her, yet could not tear him&s;elf away; he came back, he again looked at her, he hung over her in angui&s;h unutterable; he ki&s;&s;ed each burn|ing hand, he folded to his bo&s;om her feeble form, and, recovering his &s;peech, though almo&s;t bur&s;ting with &s;orrow, faintly arti|culated, <Q REND="inline">"Is all over? no ray of rea&s;on left? no knowledge of thy wretched Del|vile?&mdash;no, none! the hand of death is on her, and &s;he is utterly gone!&mdash;&s;weet &s;uf|fering excellence! loved, lo&s;t, expiring Cecilia!&mdash;but I will not repine! peace and kindred angels are watching to receive thee, and if thou art parted from thy&s;elf, it were impious to lament thou &s;hould&s;t be parted from me.&mdash;Yet in thy tomb will be depo|&s;ited all that to me could render exi&s;tence &s;upportable, every frail chance of happi|ne&s;s, every &s;u&s;taining hope, and all allevia|tion of &s;orrow!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter now again approaching, thought he perceived &s;ome change in his patient, and peremptorily forced him away from her: then returning him&s;elf, he found that her eyes were &s;hut, and &s;he was dropt a&s;leep.</P>
<P>This was an omen the mo&s;t favourable
<PB N="361" REF="360">
he could hope. He now &s;eated him&s;elf by the bed&s;ide, and determined not to quit her till the expected cri&s;is was pa&s;t. He gave the &s;tricte&s;t orders for the whole hou&s;e to be kept quiet, and &s;uffered no one in the room either to &s;peak or move.</P>
<P>Her &s;leep was long and heavy; yet, when &s;he awoke, her &s;en&s;ibility was evi|dently returned. She &s;tarted, &s;uddenly rai&s;ed her head from the pillow, looked round her, and called out, <Q REND="inline">"where am I now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thank Heaven!"</Q> cried Henrietta, and was ru&s;hing forward, when Dr. Ly&s;ter, by a &s;tern and angry look, compelled her again to take her &s;eat.</P>
<P>He then &s;poke to her him&s;elf, enquired how &s;he did, and found her quite rational.</P>
<P>Henrietta, who now doubted not her perfect recovery, wept as violently for joy as &s;he had before wept for grief; and Mary, in the &s;ame belief, ran in&s;tantly to Delvile, eager to carry to him the fir&s;t tidings that her mi&s;tre&s;s had recovered her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Delvile, in the utmo&s;t emotion, then re|turned to the chamber; but &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance from the bed, waiting Dr. Ly&s;ter's permi&s;&s;ion to approach it.</P>
<P>Cecilia was quiet and compo&s;ed, her re|collection &s;eemed re&s;tored, and her intel|lects &s;ound: but &s;he was faint and weak,
<PB N="362" REF="361">
and contentedly &s;ilent, to avoid the effort of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter encouraged this &s;tillne&s;s, and &s;uffered not any one, not even Delvile, to advance to her. After a &s;hort time, how|ever, &s;he again, and very calmly, began to talk to him. She now fir&s;t knew him, and &s;eemed much &s;urpri&s;ed by his attendance. She could not tell, &s;he &s;aid, what of late had happened to her, nor could gue&s;s where &s;he was, or by what means &s;he came into &s;uch a place. Dr. Ly&s;ter de&s;ired her at pre&s;ent not to think upon the &s;ubject, and promi&s;ed her a full account of every thing, when &s;he was &s;tronger, and more fit for conver&s;ing.</P>
<P>This for a while &s;ilenced her. But, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"Tell me,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Ly&s;ter, have I no friend in this place but you?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes, you have &s;everal friends here,"</Q> an&s;wered the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"only I keep them in order, le&s;t they &s;hould hurry or di&s;turb you."</Q></P>
<P>She &s;eemed much plea&s;ed by this &s;peech; but &s;oon after &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t not, Doctor, keep them in order much longer, for the &s;ight of them, I think, would much re|vive me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> cried Henrietta, who could not now re&s;train her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"may
<PB N="363" REF="362">
not <HI>I,</HI> among the re&s;t, come and &s;peak to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who is that?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, in a voice of plea&s;ure, though very feeble; <Q REND="inline">"is it my ever-dear Henrietta?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh this is joy indeed!"</Q> cried &s;he, fervently ki&s;&s;ing her cheeks and forehead, <Q REND="inline">"joy that I never, never expected to have more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come,"</Q> cried Doctor Ly&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"here's enough of this; did I not do well to keep &s;uch people off?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe you did,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, faint|ly &s;miling; <Q REND="inline">"my too kind Henrietta, you mu&s;t be more tranquil!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will, I will indeed, madam!&mdash;my dear, dear Mi&s;s Beverley, I will indeed!&mdash;now once you have owned me, and once again I hear your &s;weet voice, I will do any thing, and every thing, for I am made hap|py for my whole life!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, &s;weet Henrietta!"</Q> cried Cecilia, giving her her hand, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e feelings, or our Doctor here will &s;oon part us. But tell me, Doctor, is there no one el&s;e that you can let me &s;ee?"</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, who had li&s;tened to this &s;cene in the un&s;peakable perturbation of that hope which is kindled from the very a&s;hes of de&s;|pair, was now &s;pringing forward; but Dr. Ly&s;ter, fearful of the con&s;equences, ha&s;tily
<PB N="364" REF="363">
aro&s;e, and with a look and air not to be di&s;puted, took hold of his arm, and led him out of the room. He then repre&s;ented to him &s;trongly the danger of agitating or di&s;turbing her, and charged him to keep from her &s;ight till better able to bear it; a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time that he might now rea&s;onably hope her recovery.</P>
<P>Delvile, lo&s;t in tran&s;port, could make no an&s;wer, but flew into his arms, and almo&s;t madly embraced him; he then ha&s;tened out of &s;ight to pour forth fervent thanks, and hurrying back with equal &s;peed, again em|braced the Doctor, and while his manly cheeks were burnt with tears of joy, he could not yet articulate the glad tumult of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>The worthy Dr. Ly&s;ter, who heartily par|took of his happine&s;s, again urged him to be di&s;creet; and Delvile, no longer intract|able and de&s;perate, gratefully concurred in whatever he commanded. Dr. Ly&s;ter then returned to Cecilia, and to relieve her mind from any unea&s;y &s;u&s;pen&s;e, talked to her openly of Delvile, gave her to under&s;tand he was acquainted with her marriage, and told her he had prohibited their meeting till each was better able to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>Cecilia by this delay &s;eemed half grati|fied, and half di&s;appointed; but the re&s;t of the phy&s;icians, who had been &s;ummoned
<PB N="365" REF="364">
upon this happy change, now appearing, the orders were yet more &s;trictly enforced for keeping her quiet.</P>
<P>She &s;ubmitted, therefore, peaceably; and Delvile, who&s;e gladdened heart &s;till throbbed with &s;peechle&s;s rapture, content|edly watched at her chamber door, and obeyed implicitly whatever was &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>She now vi&s;ibly, and almo&s;t hourly grew better; and, in a &s;hort time, her anxiety to know all that was pa&s;&s;ed, and by what means &s;he became &s;o ill, and confined in a hou&s;e of which &s;he had not any knowledge, obliged Dr. Ly&s;ter to make him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of the&s;e particulars, that he might com|municate them to her with a calmne&s;s that Delvile could not attain.</P>
<P>Delvile him&s;elf, happy to be &s;pared the bitter ta&s;k of &s;uch a relation, informed him all he knew of the &s;tory, and then entreat|ed him to narrate to her al&s;o the motives of his own &s;trange, and he feared unpardon|able conduct, and the &s;cenes which had fol|lowed their parting.</P>
<P>He came, he &s;aid, to England, ignorant of all that had pa&s;t in his ab&s;ence, intend|ing merely to wait upon his father, and communicate his marriage, before he gave directions to his lawyer for the &s;ettlements and preparations which were to precede its
<PB N="366" REF="365">
further publication. He meant, al&s;o, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, of the real &s;ituation of Mr. Monckton, and then, after an interview with Cecilia, to have returned to his mo|ther, and waited at Nice till he might pub|licly claim his wife.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e he had written in his letter, which he meant to have put in the Po&s;t-office in London him&s;elf; and he had but ju&s;t alighted from his chai&s;e, when he met Ralph, Cecilia's &s;ervant, in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily &s;topping him, he enquired if he had left his place? <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered Ralph, <Q REND="inline">"I am only come up to town with my lady."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With your lady!"</Q> cried the a&s;toni&s;hed Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is your lady then in town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, &s;ir, &s;he is at Mrs. Belfield's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At Mrs. Belfield's?&mdash;is her daugh|ter returned home?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, &s;ir, we left her in the country."</Q></P>
<P>He was then going on with a further account, but, in too much confu&s;ion of mind to hear him, Delvile abruptly wi&s;h|ed him good night, and marched on him|&s;elf towards Belfield's.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure with which he would have heard that Cecilia was &s;o near to him, was totally lo&s;t in his perplexity to account for her journey. Her letters had never hinted at &s;uch a purpo&s;e,&mdash;the news reached him
<PB N="367" REF="366">
only by accident,&mdash;it was ten o'clock at night,&mdash;yet &s;he was at Belfield's&mdash;though the &s;i&s;ter was away,&mdash;though the mother was profe&s;&s;edly odious to her!&mdash;In an in&s;tant, all he had formerly heard, all he had formerly di&s;regarded, ru&s;hed &s;uddenly upon his memory, and he began to believe he had been deluded, that his father was right, and that Belfield had &s;ome &s;trange and improper influence over her heart.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picion was death to him; he drove it from him, he concluded the whole was &s;ome error: his rea&s;on as powerfully as his tenderne&s;s vindicated her innocence; and though he arrived at the hou&s;e in much di&s;order, he yet arrived with a firm per|&s;ua&s;ion of an honourable explanation.</P>
<P>The door was open,&mdash;a chai&s;e was at it in waiting,&mdash;Mrs. Belfield was li&s;tening in the pa&s;&s;age; the&s;e appearances were &s;trange, and encrea&s;ed his agitation. He a&s;ked for her &s;on in a voice &s;carce audible,&mdash;&s;he told him he was engaged with a lady, and mu&s;t not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>That fatal an&s;wer, at a moment &s;o big with the mo&s;t horrible &s;urmi&s;es, was deci|&s;ive: furiou&s;ly, therefore, he forced him|&s;elf pa&s;t her, and opened the door:&mdash;but when he &s;aw them together,&mdash;the re&s;t of the family confe&s;&s;edly excluded, his rage
<PB N="368" REF="367">
turned to horror, and he could hardly &s;upport him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Dr. Ly&s;ter!"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"a&s;k of the &s;weet creature if the&s;e circum&s;tances offer any extenuation for the fatal jealou&s;y which &s;eized me? never by my&s;elf while I live will it be forgiven, but &s;he, perhaps, who is all &s;oftne&s;s, all compa&s;&s;ion, and all peace, may &s;ome time hence think my &s;uffer|ings almo&s;t equal to my offence."</Q></P>
<P>He then proceeded in his narration.</P>
<P>When he had &s;o peremptorily ordered her chai&s;e to St. James's-&s;quare, he went back to the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired Belfield to walk out with him. He complied, and they were both &s;ilent till they came to a Coffee-hou&s;e, where they a&s;ked for a pri|vate room. The whole way they went, his heart, &s;ecretly &s;atisfied of the purity of Cecilia, &s;mote him for the &s;ituation in which he had left her; yet, having unfor|tunately gone &s;o far as to make his &s;u&s;pi|cions apparent, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to his character that their abolition &s;hould be equally public.</P>
<P>When they were alone, <Q REND="inline">"Belfield,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"to obviate any imputation of im|pertinence in my enquiries, I deny not, what I pre&s;ume you have been told by her|&s;elf, that I have the neare&s;t intere&s;t in whatever
<PB N="369" REF="368">
concerns the lady from whom we are ju&s;t now parted: I mu&s;t beg, therefore, an ex|plicit account of the purpo&s;e of your pri|vate conver&s;ation with her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile,"</Q> an&s;wered Belfield, with mingled candour and &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"I am not com|monly much di&s;po&s;ed to an&s;wer enquiries thus cavalierly put to me; yet here, as I find my&s;elf not the principal per&s;on con|cerned, I think I am bound in ju&s;tice to &s;peak for the ab&s;ent who is. I a&s;&s;ure you, therefore, mo&s;t &s;olemnly, that your intere&s;t in Mi&s;s Beverley I never heard but by com|mon report, that our being alone together was by both of us unde&s;igned and unde|&s;ired, that the honour &s;he did our hou&s;e in calling at it, was merely to acquaint my mother with my &s;i&s;ter's removal to Mrs. Harrel's, and that the part which I had my&s;elf in her conde&s;cen&s;ion, was &s;imply to be con&s;ulted upon a journey which &s;he has in contemplation to the South of France. And now, &s;ir, having given you this peaceable &s;atisfaction, you will find me extremely at your &s;ervice to offer any other."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile in&s;tantly held out his hand to him; <Q REND="inline">"What you a&s;&s;ert,"</Q> he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"upon your honour, requires no other te&s;timony. Your gallantry and your probity are equal|ly well known to me; with either, therefore,
<PB N="370" REF="369">
I am content, and by no means re|quire the intervention of both."</Q></P>
<P>They then parted; and now, his doubts removed, and his punctilio &s;atisfied, he flew to St. James's-&s;quare, to entreat the forgivene&s;s of Cecilia for the alarm he had occa&s;ioned her, and to hear the rea&s;on of her &s;udden journey, and change of mea|&s;ures. But when he came there, to find that his father, whom he had concluded was at Delvile Ca&s;tle, was in the hou&s;e, while Cecilia had not even enquired for him at the door,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Oh let me not,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"even to my&s;elf, let me not trace the agony of that moment!&mdash;where to &s;eek her I knew not, why &s;he was in London I could not divine, for what pur|po&s;e &s;he had given the po&s;tilion a new di|rection I could form no idea. Yet it ap|peared that &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid me, and once more, in the frenzy of my di&s;appointment, I &s;uppo&s;ed Belfield a party in her conceal|ment. Again, therefore, I &s;ought him,&mdash;at his own hou&s;e,&mdash;at the coffee-hou&s;e where I had left him,&mdash;in vain, wherever I came, I ju&s;t mi&s;&s;ed him, for, hearing of my &s;earch, he went with equal re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, from place to place to meet me. I rejoice we both failed; a repetition of my enquiries in my then irritable &s;tate, mu&s;t inevitably have provoked the mo&s;t fatal re&s;entment.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not dwell upon the &s;cenes that
<PB N="371" REF="370">
followed,&mdash;my laborious &s;earch, my fruit|le&s;s wanderings, the di&s;traction of my &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, the exce&s;s of my de&s;pair!&mdash;even Belfield, the fiery Belfield, when I met with him the next day, was &s;o much touched by my wretchedne&s;s, that he bore with all my inju&s;tice; feeling, noble young man! never will I lo&s;e the remembrance of his high-&s;ouled patience.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And now, Dr. Ly&s;ter, go to my Ceci|lia; tell her this tale, and try, for you have &s;kill &s;ufficient, to &s;often, yet not wound her with my &s;ufferings. If then &s;he can bear to &s;ee me, to ble&s;s me with the &s;ound of her &s;weet voice, no longer at war with her intellects, to hold out to me her loved hand, in token of peace and for|givene&s;s.&mdash;Oh, Dr. Ly&s;ter! pre&s;erver of <HI>my</HI> life in hers! give to me but that ex|qui&s;ite moment, and every pa&s;t evil will be for ever obliterated!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t be calmer, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"before I make the attempt. The&s;e heroicks are mighty well for &s;ound health, and &s;trong nerves, but they will not do for an invalide."</Q></P>
<P>He went, however, to Cecilia, and gave her this narration, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing whatever he feared would mo&s;t affect her, and judiciou&s;ly enlivening the whole by his &s;trictures. Ce|cilia was much ea&s;ier for this removal of
<PB N="372" REF="371">
her perplexities, and, as her angui&s;h and her terror had been unmixed with re&s;ent|ment, &s;he had now no de&s;ire but to recon|cile Delvile with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter, however, by his friendly au|thority, obliged her for &s;ome time to be content with this relation; but when &s;he grew better, her impatience became &s;trong|er, and he feared oppo&s;ition would be as hurtful as compliance.</P>
<P>Delvile, therefore, was now admitted; yet &s;lowly and with trepidation he advanced, terrified for her, and fearful of him&s;elf, filled with remor&s;e for the injuries &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, and impre&s;&s;ed with grief and horror to behold her &s;o ill and altered.</P>
<P>Supported by pillows, &s;he &s;at almo&s;t upright. The moment &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he attempted to bend forward and welcome him, calling out in a tone of plea&s;ure, though faintly, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! deare&s;t Delvile! is it you?"</Q> but too weak for the effort &s;he had made, &s;he &s;unk back upon her pillow, pale, trembling, and di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter would then have interfered to po&s;tpone their further conver&s;ation; but Delvile was no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf or his pa&s;&s;ions: he darted forward, and kneel|ing at the bed &s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"Sweet injured excel|lence!"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"wife of my heart! &s;ole object of my cho&s;en affection! do&s;t thou
<PB N="373" REF="372">
yet live? do I hear thy loved voice?&mdash;do I &s;ee thee again?&mdash;art thou my Cecilia? and have I indeed not lo&s;t thee?"</Q> then re|garding her more fixedly, <Q REND="inline">"Alas,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"art thou indeed my Cecilia! &s;o pale, &s;o emaciated!&mdash;Oh &s;uffering angel! and could&s;t thou then call upon Delvile, the guilty, but heart-broken Delvile, thy de|&s;troyer, thy murderer, and yet not call to execrate him?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely affected, could not utter a word; &s;he held out to him her hand, &s;he looked at him with gentlene&s;s and kindne&s;s, but tears &s;tarted into her eyes, and trickled in large drops down her colour|le&s;s cheeks.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Angelic creature!"</Q> cried Delvile, his own tears overflowing, while he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips the kind token of her pardon, <Q REND="inline">"can you give to me again a hand &s;o ill de&s;erved? can you look with &s;uch compa&s;&s;ion on the author of your woes? on the wretch, who for an in&s;tant could doubt the purity of a mind &s;o &s;eraphic!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Delvile!"</Q> cried &s;he, a little re|viving, <Q REND="inline">"think no more of what is pa&s;t!&mdash;to &s;ee you,&mdash;to be yours,&mdash;drives all evil from my remembrance!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not worthy this joy!"</Q> cried he ri&s;ing, kneeling, and ri&s;ing again; <Q REND="inline">"I know not how to &s;u&s;tain it! a forgivene&s;s &s;uch
<PB N="374" REF="373">
as this,&mdash;when I believed you mu&s;t hate me for ever! when repul&s;e and aver&s;ion were all I dared expect,&mdash;when my own in|humanity had bereft thee of thy rea&s;on,&mdash;when the grave, the pitile&s;s grave, was al|ready open to receive thee,"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Too kind, too feeling Delvile!"</Q> cried the penetrated Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"relieve your load|ed heart from the&s;e bitter recollections; mine is lightened already,&mdash;lightened, I think, of every thing but its affection for <HI>you!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh words of tran&s;port and extacy!"</Q> cried the enraptured Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"oh partner of my life! friend, &s;olace, darling of my bo&s;om! that &s;o lately I thought expiring! that I folded to my bleeding heart in the agony of eternal &s;eparation!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come away, Sir, come away,"</Q> cried Dr. Ly&s;ter, who now &s;aw that Cecilia was greatly agitated, <Q REND="inline">"I will not be an&s;werable for the continuation of this &s;cene;"</Q> and taking him by the arm, he awakened him from his frantic rapture, by a&s;&s;uring him &s;he would faint, and forced him away from her.</P>
<P>Soon after he was gone, and Cecilia be|came more tranquil, Henrietta, who had wept with bitterne&s;s in a corner of the room during this &s;cene, approached her, and, with an attempted &s;mile, though in a voice
<PB N="375" REF="374">
hardly audible, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Mi&s;s Beverley, you will, at la&s;t, then be happy! happy as all your goodne&s;s de&s;erves. And I am &s;ure I &s;hould rejoice in it if I was to die to make you happier!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who but too well knew her full meaning, tenderly embraced her, but was prevented by Dr. Ly&s;ter from entering in|to any di&s;cour&s;e with her.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t meeting, however, with Delvile being over, the &s;econd was far more quiet, and in a very &s;hort time, he would &s;carcely quit her a moment, Cecilia her&s;elf receiving from his &s;ight a plea&s;ure too great for denial, yet too &s;erene for danger.</P>
<P>The worthy Dr. Ly&s;ter, finding her pro&s;pect of recovery thus fair, prepared for leaving London: but, equally de&s;irous to do good out of his profe&s;&s;ion as in it, he fir&s;t, at the reque&s;t of Delvile, waited upon his father, to acquaint him with his pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;olicit his directions for his future proceedings, and endeavour to nego|ciate a general reconciliation.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, to who&s;e proud heart &s;oci|al joy could find no avenue, was yet touch|ed mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly by the re&s;toration of Ce|cilia. Neither his dignity nor his di&s;plea|&s;ure had been able to repre&s;s remor&s;e, a feeling to which, with all his foibles, he had not been accu&s;tomed. The view of
<PB N="376" REF="375">
her di&s;traction had dwelt upon his imagi|nation, the de&s;pondency of his &s;on had &s;truck him with fear and horror. He had been haunted by &s;elf reproach, and pur&s;ued by vain regret; and tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions he had refu&s;ed to tenderne&s;s and entreaty, he now willingly accorded to change repen|tance for tranquility. He &s;ent in&s;tantly for his &s;on, whom even with tears he em|braced, and felt his own peace re&s;tored as he pronounced his forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>New, however, to kindne&s;s, he retained it not long, and a &s;tranger to genero&s;ity, he knew not how to make her welcome: the extinction of his remor&s;e abated his com|pa&s;&s;ion for Cecilia, and when &s;olicited to receive her, he revived the charges of Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P>Cecilia, informed of this, determined to write to that gentleman her&s;elf, who&s;e long and painful illne&s;s, joined to his irrecover|able lo&s;s of her, &s;he now hoped might prevail with him to make reparation for the injuries he had done her.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. MONCKTON.</HEAD>
<P>I write not, Sir, to upbraid you; the woes which have followed your ill offices, and which you may &s;ome time hear, will
<PB N="377" REF="376">
render my reproaches &s;uperfluous.

<P>In remembrance of my former long friend&s;hip, I &s;end you my good wi&s;hes; and in con&s;ideration of my hopes from your recantation, I &s;end you, Sir, if you think it worth acceptance, my forgive|ne&s;s.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Monckton, after many long and painful &s;truggles between u&s;ele&s;s rage, and involuntary remor&s;e, at length &s;ent the following an&s;wer.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. MORTIMER DELVILE.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e who could ever believe you guil|ty, mu&s;t have been eager to think you &s;o. I meant but your welfare at all times, and to have &s;aved you from a connection I never thought equal to your merit. I am grieved, but not &s;urpri&s;ed, to hear of your injuries; from the alliance you have formed,
<PB N="378" REF="377">
nothing el&s;e could be expected: if my te&s;|timony to your innocence can, however, &s;erve to mitigate them, I &s;cruple not to de|clare I believe it without taint.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Delvile &s;ent by Dr. Ly&s;ter this letter to his father, who&s;e rage at the detection of the perfidy which had deceived him, was yet inferior to what he felt that his family was mentioned &s;o injuriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>His conference with Dr. Ly&s;ter was long and painful, but deci&s;ive: that &s;agacious and friendly man knew well how to work upon his pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;o effectually awak|ened them by repre&s;enting the di&s;grace of his own family from the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Cecilia, that before he quitted his hou&s;e he was authori&s;ed to invite her to remove to it.</P>
<P>When he returned from his emba&s;&s;y, he found Delvile in her room, and each wait|ing with impatience the event of his nego|ciation.</P>
<P>The Doctor with much alacrity gave Ce|cilia the invitation with which he had been charged; but Delvile, jealous for her dig|nity, was angry and di&s;&s;atisfied his father brought it not him&s;elf, and exclaimed with much mortification, <Q REND="inline">"Is this all the grace accorded me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Patience, patience, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered the Doctor; <Q REND="inline">"when you have thwarted any body in their fir&s;t hope and ambition, do
<PB N="379" REF="378">
you expect they will &s;end you their compli|ments and many thanks for the di&s;appoint|ment? Pray let the good gentleman have his way in &s;ome little matters, &s;ince you have taken &s;uch effectual care to put out of his reach the power of having it in greater."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O far from &s;tarting ob&s;tacles,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"let us &s;olicit a reconciliation with whatever conce&s;&s;ions he may require. The mi&s;ery of DISOBEDIENCE we have but too fatally experienced; and thinking as we think of filial ties and parental claims, how can we ever hope happine&s;s till for|given and taken into favour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, my Cecilia,"</Q> an&s;wered Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"and generous and conde&s;cending as true; and if <HI>you</HI> can thus &s;weetly comply, I will gratefully forbear making any oppo&s;ition. Too much already have you &s;uffered from the impetuo&s;ity of my temper, but I will try to curb it in future by the remembrance of your injuries."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The whole of this unfortunate bu&s;i|ne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Dr. Ly&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"has been the re|&s;ult of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. Your uncle, the Dean, began it, by his arbitrary will, as if an ordinance of his own could arre&s;t the cour&s;e of nature! and as if <HI>he</HI> had power to keep alive, by the loan of a name, a family in the male branch already extinct. Your father, Mr. Mortimer, continued it
<PB N="380" REF="379">
with the &s;ame &s;elf-partiality, preferring the wretched gratification of tickling his ear with a favourite &s;ound, to the &s;olid happi|ne&s;s of his &s;on with a rich and de&s;erving wife. Yet this, however, remember; if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your mi&s;eries, &s;o wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to PRIDE and PREJU|DICE you will al&s;o owe their termination: for all that I could &s;ay to Mr. Delvile, either of rea&s;oning or entreaty,&mdash;and I &s;aid all I could &s;ugge&s;t, and I &s;ugge&s;ted all a man need wi&s;h to hear,&mdash;was totally thrown away, till I pointed out to him his <HI>own</HI> di&s;|grace, in having a <HI>daughter-in-law</HI> immured in the&s;e mean lodgings!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thus, my dear young lady, the terror which drove you to this hou&s;e, and the &s;uf|ferings which have confined you in it, will prove, in the event, the &s;ource of your future peace: for when all my be&s;t rheto|rick failed to melt Mr. Delvile, I in&s;tantly brought him to terms by coupling his name with a pawnbroker's! And he could not with more di&s;gu&s;t hear his &s;on called Mr. Beverley, than think of his &s;on's wife when he hears of the <HI>Three Blue Balls!</HI> Thus the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, taking but different direc|tions, <HI>do</HI> mi&s;chief and <HI>cure</HI> it alternately.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Such, my good young friends, is the MORAL of your calamities. You have
<PB N="381" REF="380">
all, in my opinion, been &s;trangely at cro&s;s purpo&s;es, and trifled, no one knows why, with the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life. My only hope is that now, having among you thrown away its luxuries, you will have known enough of mi&s;ery to be glad to keep its ne|ce&s;&s;aries."</Q></P>
<P>This excellent man was yet prevailed upon by Delvile to &s;tay and a&s;&s;i&s;t in remov|ing the feeble Cecilia to St. James's-&s;quare.</P>
<P>Henrietta, for whom Mr. Arnott's equi|page and &s;ervants had &s;till remained in town, was then, though with much diffi|culty, per&s;uaded to go back to Suffolk: but Cecilia, however fond of her &s;ociety, was too &s;en&s;ible of the danger and impro|priety of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to receive from it any plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile's reception of Cecilia was formal and cold: yet, as &s;he now appeared publicly in the character of his &s;on's wife, the be&s;t apartment in his hou&s;e had been prepared for her u&s;e, his dome&s;tics were in|&s;tructed to wait upon her with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and Lady Honoria Pemberton, who was accidently in town, offered from curio|&s;ity, what Mr. Delvile accepted from pa|rade, to be her&s;elf in St. James's-&s;quare, in order to do honour to his daughter-in-law's fir&s;t entrance.</P>
<P>When Cecilia was a little recovered from
<PB N="382" REF="381">
the &s;hock of the fir&s;t interview, and the fa|tigueof her removal, the anxious Mortimer would in&s;tantly have had her conveyed to her own apartment; but, willing to exert her&s;elf, and hoping to oblige Mr. Delvile, &s;he declared &s;he was well able to remain &s;ome time longer in the drawing-room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My good friends,"</Q> &s;aid Dr. Ly&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"in the cour&s;e of my long practice, I have found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tudy the human frame, without a little &s;tudying the human mind; and from all that I have yet been able to make out, either by ob&s;ervation, re|flection, or compari&s;on, it appears to me at this moment, that Mr. Mortimer Delvile has got the be&s;t wife, and that you, Sir, have here the mo&s;t faultle&s;s daughter-in-law, that any hu&s;band or any father in the three kingdoms belonging to his Maje&s;ty can either have or de&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;miled; Mortimer looked his de|lighted concurrence; Mr. Delvile forced him&s;elf to make a &s;tiff inclination of the head; and Lady Honoria gaily exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Ly&s;ter, when you &s;ay the <HI>be&s;t</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>faultle&s;s,</HI> you &s;hould always add the re&s;t of company excepted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon my word,"</Q> cried the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"I beg your lady&s;hip's pardon; but there is a certain unguarded warmth comes acro&s;s a man now and then, that drives <HI>etiquette</HI>
<PB N="383" REF="382">
out of his head, and makes him &s;peak truth before he well knows where he is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O terrible!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"this is &s;ink|ing deeper and deeper. I had hoped the town air would have taught you better things; but I find you have vi&s;ited at Del|vile Ca&s;tle till you are fit for no other place."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whoever, Lady Honoria,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, much offended, <Q REND="inline">"is fit for Del|vile Ca&s;tle, mu&s;t be fit for <HI>every</HI> other place; though every other place may by no means be fit for him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, giddily, <Q REND="inline">"every po&s;&s;ible place will be fit for him, if he can once bear with that. Don't you think &s;o, Dr. Ly&s;ter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, when a man has the honour to &s;ee your lady&s;hip,"</Q> an&s;wered he, good-hu|mouredly, <Q REND="inline">"he is apt to think too much of the per&s;on, to care about the place."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, I begin to have &s;ome hopes of you,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;ee, for a Doctor, you have really a very pretty notion of a compliment: only you have one great fault &s;till; you look the whole time as if you &s;aid it for a joke."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, in fact, madam, when a man has been a plain dealer both in word and look for upwards of fifty years, 'tis expect|ing too quick a reformation to demand
<PB N="384" REF="383">
ductility of voice and eye from him at a blow. However, give me but a little time and a little encouragement, and, with &s;uch a tutre&s;s, 'twill be hard if I do not, in a very few le&s;&s;ons, learn the right method of &s;ea&s;oning a &s;imper, and the newe&s;t fa&s;hion of twi&s;ting words from meaning."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But pray,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, always remember to look &s;erious. Nothing &s;ets off a compliment &s;o much as a long face. If you are tempted to an un|&s;ea&s;onable laugh, think of Delvile Ca&s;tle; 'tis an expedient I commonly make u&s;e of my&s;elf when I am afraid of being too fri&s;ky: and it always &s;ucceeds, for the very recol|lection of it gives me the head-ache in a moment. Upon my word, Mr. Delvile, you mu&s;t have the con&s;titution of five men, to have kept &s;uch good health, after living &s;o long at that horrible place. You can't imagine how you've &s;urpri&s;ed me, for I have regularly expected to hear of your death at the end of every &s;ummer: and, I a&s;&s;ure you, once, I was very near buying mourning."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The e&s;tate which de&s;cends to a man from his own ance&s;tors, Lady Honoria,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"will &s;eldom be apt to injure his health, if he is con&s;cious of committing no mi&s;demeanour which has degraded their memory."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="384">
<Q REND="inline">"How va&s;tly odious this new father of yours is!"</Q> &s;aid Lady Honoria, in a whi&s;per to Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"what could ever in|duce you to give up your charming e&s;tate for the &s;ake of coming into his fu&s;ty old family! I would really advi&s;e you to have your marriage annulled. You have only, you know, to take an oath that you were forcibly run away with; and as you are an Heire&s;s, and the Delviles are all &s;o violent, it will ea&s;ily be credited. And then, as &s;oon as you are at liberty, I would advi&s;e you to marry my little Lord Derford."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would you only, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"have me regain my freedom in order to part with it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> an&s;wered Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"for you can do nothing at all without being married; a &s;ingle woman is a thou|&s;and times more &s;hackled than a wife; for, &s;he is accountable to every body; and a wife, you know, has nothing to do but ju&s;t to manage her hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And that,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"you con&s;ider as a trifle?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, if you do but marry a man you don't care for."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are right, then, indeed, to recom|mend to me my Lord Derford!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, he will make the prettie&s;t hu&s;|band in the world; you may fly about your&s;elf
<PB N="386" REF="385">
as wild as a lark, and keep him the whole time as tame as a jack-daw: and though he may complain of you to your friends, he will never have the courage to find fault to your face. But as to Morti|mer, you will not be able to govern him as long as you live; for the moment you have put him upon the fret, you'll fall into the dumps your&s;elf, hold out your hand to him, and, lo&s;ing the opportunity of gaining &s;ome material point, make up at the fir&s;t &s;oft word."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You think, then, the quarrel more amu&s;ing than the reconciliation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, a thou&s;and times! for while you are quarrelling, you may &s;ay any thing, and demand any thing, but when you are recon|ciled, you ought to behave pretty, and &s;eem contented."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e who pre&s;ume to have any pre|ten&s;ions to your lady&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"would be made happy indeed &s;hould they hear your principles!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, it would not &s;ignify at all,"</Q> an|&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for one's fathers, and uncles, and tho&s;e &s;ort of people, always make con|nexions for one, and not a creature thinks of our principles, till they find them out by our conduct: and nobody can po&s;&s;ibly do that till we are married, for they give us no power beforehand. The men know nothing
<PB N="387" REF="386">
of us in the world while we are &s;ingle, but how we can dance a minuet, or play a le&s;&s;on upon the harp&s;ichord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what el&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, who advanced, and heard this la&s;t &s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"need a young lady of rank de&s;ire to be known for? your lady&s;hip &s;urely would not have her degrade her&s;elf by &s;tudying like an ar|ti&s;t or profe&s;&s;or?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, Sir, I would not have her &s;tudy at all; it's mighty well for children, but really after &s;ixteen, and when one is come out, one has quite fatigue enough in dre&s;&s;ing, and going to public places, and ordering new things, without all that tor|ment of fir&s;t and &s;econd po&s;ition, and E upon the fir&s;t line, and F upon the fir&s;t &s;pace!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip mu&s;t, however, par|don me for hinting,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that a young lady of condition, who has a proper &s;en&s;e of her dignity, cannot be &s;een too rarely, or known too little."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but I hate dignity!"</Q> cried &s;he, care|le&s;sly, <Q REND="inline">"for its the dulle&s;t thing in the world. I always thought it was owing to that you were &s;o little amu&s;ing;&mdash;really I beg your pardon, Sir, I meant to &s;ay &s;o little talkative."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can ea&s;ily credit that your lady&s;hip &s;poke ha&s;tily,"</Q> an&s;wered he, highly piqued,
<PB N="388" REF="387">
<Q REND="inline">"for I believe, indeed, a per&s;on of a family &s;uch as mine, will hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have come into the world for the office of amu&s;ing it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, with pretended innocence, <Q REND="inline">"nobody, I am &s;ure, ever &s;aw you with &s;uch a thought."</Q> Then, turning to Cecilia, &s;he added in a whi&s;per, <Q REND="inline">"You cannot imagine, my dear Mrs. Mortimer, how I dete&s;t this old cou&s;in of mine! Now pray tell me hone&s;tly if you don't hate him your&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to have no rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, how you are always upon your guard! If I were half as cautious, I &s;hould die of the vapours in a month; the only thing that keeps me at all alive, is now and then making people angry; for the folks at our hou&s;e let me go out &s;o &s;eldom, and then &s;end me with &s;uch &s;tupid old chaperons, that giving them a little torment is really the only entertainment I can procure my|&s;elf. O&mdash;but I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you a mo&s;t delightful thing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you mu&s;t know I have the great|e&s;t hopes in the world that my father will quarrel with old Mr. Delvile!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is that &s;uch a delightful thing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes; I have lived upon the very
<PB N="389" REF="388">
idea this fortnight; for then, you know, they'll both be in a pa&s;&s;ion, and I &s;hall &s;ee which of them looks frightfulle&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When Lady Honoria whi&s;pers,"</Q> cried Mortimer, <Q REND="inline">"I always &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;|chief."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered her lady&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"I was merely congratulating Mrs. Morti|mer about her marriage. Though really, upon &s;econd thoughts, I don't know whether I &s;hould not rather condole with her, for I have long been convinced &s;he has a prodi|gious antipathy to you. I &s;aw it the whole time I was at Delvile Ca&s;tle, where &s;he u&s;ed to change colour at the very &s;ound of your name; a &s;ymptom I never perceived when I talked to her of my Lord Derford, who would certainly have made her a thou|&s;and times a better hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you mean on account of his title, Lady Honoria,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile: <Q REND="inline">"your lady&s;hip mu&s;t be &s;trangely forgetful of the connections of your family, not to remember that Mortimer, after the death of his uncle and my&s;elf, mu&s;t inevitably inherit one far more honourable than a new-&s;prung-up fa|mily, like my Lord Ernolf's, could offer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but then, you know, &s;he would have kept her e&s;tate, which would have been a va&s;tly better thing than an old pedigree of new relations. Be&s;ides, I don't
<PB N="390" REF="389">
find that any body cares for the noble blood of the Delviles but them&s;elves; and if &s;he had kept her fortune, every body, I fancy, would have cared for <HI>that.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Every body, then,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t be highly mercenary and ignoble, or the blood of an ancient and honourable hou&s;e, would be thought contaminated by the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of &s;o degrading a com|pari&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir, what &s;hould we all do with birth if it was not for wealth? it would nei|ther take us to Ranelagh nor the Opera; nor buy us caps nor wigs, nor &s;upply us with dinners, nor bouquets."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Caps and wigs, dinners and bou|quets!"</Q> interrupted Mr. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"your lady&s;hip's e&s;timate of wealth is really ex|tremely minute."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, you know, Sir, as to caps and wigs, they are very &s;erious things, for we &s;hould look mighty droll figures to go about bare-headed; and as to dinners, how would the Delviles have la&s;ted all the&s;e thou|&s;and centuries if they had di&s;dained eating them?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever may be your lady&s;hip's &s;a|tisfaction,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"in depreciating a hou&s;e that has the honour of being nearly allied with your own, you will not, I hope at lea&s;t, in&s;truct this lady,"</Q>
<PB N="391" REF="390">
turning to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to adopt a &s;imilar con|tempt of its antiquity and dignity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This lady,"</Q> cried Mortimer, <Q REND="inline">"will at lea&s;t, by conde&s;cending to become one of it, &s;ecure us from any danger that &s;uch contempt may &s;pread further."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let me but,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, looking gratefully at him, <Q REND="inline">"be as &s;ecure from exciting as I am from feeling contempt, and what can I have to wi&s;h?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good and excellent young lady!"</Q> &s;aid Dr. Ly&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings in|deed is yours in the temperance of your own mind. When you began your career in life, you appeared to us &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals, to po&s;&s;e&s;s more than your &s;hare of the good things of this world; &s;uch a union of riches, beauty, independence, ta|lents, education and virtue, &s;eemed a mo|nopoly to rai&s;e general envy and di&s;con|tent; but mark with what &s;crupulous ex|actne&s;s the good and bad is ever balanced! You have had a thou&s;and &s;orrows to which tho&s;e who have looked up to you have been &s;trangers, and for which not all the advan|tages you po&s;&s;e&s;s have been equivalent. There is evidently throughout this world, in things as well as per&s;ons, a levelling prin|ciple, at war with pre-eminence, and de&s;truc|tive of perfection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> cried Mortimer, in a low voice
<PB N="392" REF="391">
to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"how much higher mu&s;t we all ri&s;e, or how much lower mu&s;t you fall, ere any levelling principle will approxi|mate us with YOU!"</Q></P>
<P>He then entreated her to &s;pare her &s;trength and &s;pirits by returning to her own apartment, and the conver&s;ation was brok|en up.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray permit me, Mrs. Mortimer,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, in taking leave, <Q REND="inline">"to beg that the fir&s;t gue&s;t you invite to Delvile Ca&s;tle may be me. You know my partiali|ty to it already. I &s;hall be particularly happy in waiting upon you in tempe&s;tuous weather! We can all &s;troll out together, you know, very &s;ociably; and I &s;ha'n't be much in your way, for if there &s;hould hap|pen to be a &s;torm, you can ea&s;ily lodge me under &s;ome great tree, and while you amu&s;e your&s;elves with a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, give me the indulgence of my own reflections. I am va&s;tly fond of thinking, and being alone, you know,&mdash;e&s;pecially in thunder and light|ening!"</Q></P>
<P>She then ran away; and they all &s;eparat|ed: Cecilia was conveyed up &s;tairs, and the worthy Dr. Ly&s;ter, loaded with acknow|ledgments of every kind, &s;et out for the country.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;till weak, and much emaciated, for &s;ome time lived almo&s;t wholly in her
<PB N="393" REF="392">
own room; where the grateful and &s;olici|tous attendance of Mortimer, alleviated the pain both of her illne&s;s and confinement: but as &s;oon as her health permitted travel|ling, he ha&s;tened with her abroad.</P>
<P>Here tranquility once more made its abode the heart of Cecilia; that heart &s;o long torn with angui&s;h, &s;u&s;pen&s;e and hor|rour! Mrs. Delvile received her with the mo&s;t rapturous fondne&s;s, and the impre&s;&s;ion of her &s;orrows gradually wore away, from her kind and maternal cares, and from the watchful affection and delighted tenderne&s;s of her &s;on.</P>
<P>The Eggle&s;tons now took entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her e&s;tate, and Delvile, at her en|treaty, forbore &s;hewing any per&s;onal re|&s;entment of their conduct, and put into the hands of a lawyer the arrangement of the affair.</P>
<P>They continued abroad &s;ome months, and the health of Mrs. Delvile was toler|ably re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. They were then &s;um|moned home by the death of Lord Delvile, who bequeathed to his nephew Mortimer his town hou&s;e, and whatever of his e&s;tate was not annexed to his title, which nece&s;&s;arily devolved to his brother.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ter of Mrs. Delvile, a woman of high &s;pirit and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, lived not long after him; but having, in her latter
<PB N="394" REF="393">
days, intimately connected her&s;elf with Ce|cilia, &s;he was &s;o much charmed with her character, and &s;o much dazzled by her ad|miration of the extraordinary &s;acrifice &s;he had made, that, in a fit of &s;udden enthu|&s;ia&s;m, &s;he altered her will, to leave to her, and to her &s;ole di&s;po&s;al, the fortune which, almo&s;t from his infancy, &s;he had de&s;|tined for her nephew. Cecilia, a&s;toni&s;hed and penetrated, oppo&s;ed the alteration; but even her &s;i&s;ter, now Lady Delvile, to whom &s;he daily became dearer, earne&s;tly &s;upported it; while Mortimer, delighted to re&s;tore to her through his own family, any part of that power and independence of which her generous and pure regard for him&s;elf had deprived her, was ab&s;olute in refu&s;ing that the deed &s;hould be revoked.</P>
<P>Cecilia, from this flattering tran&s;action, received a further conviction of the malig|nant fal&s;ehood of Mr. Monckton, who had always repre&s;ented to her the whole of the Delvile family as equally poor in their cir|cum&s;tances, and illiberal in their minds. The &s;trong &s;pirit of active benevolence which had ever marked her character, was now again di&s;played, though no longer, as hitherto, unbounded. She had learnt the error of profu&s;ion, even in charity and bene|ficence; and &s;he had a motive for oeconomy, in her animated affection for Mortimer.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="394">
She &s;oon &s;ent for Albany, who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e that &s;he &s;till exi&s;ted, and who&s;e rapture at her recovered pro&s;perity, now threatened his &s;en&s;es from the tumult of his joy, with nearly the &s;ame danger they had lately been menaced by terror. But though her dona|tions were circum&s;cribed by prudence, and their objects were &s;elected with di&s;crimina|tion, &s;he gave to her&s;elf all her former be|nevolent plea&s;ure, in &s;olacing his afflic|tions, while &s;he &s;oftened his a&s;perity, by re&s;toring to him his favourite office of being her almoner and monitor.</P>
<P>She next &s;ent to her own pen&s;ioners, re|lieved tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which her &s;udden ab&s;ence had occa&s;ioned, and renewed and continued the &s;alaries &s;he had allowed them. All who had nouri&s;hed rea&s;onable expecta|tions from her bounty &s;he remembered, though &s;he rai&s;ed no new claimants but with oeconomy and circum&s;pection. But neither Albany nor the old pen&s;ioners felt the &s;atisfaction of Mortimer, who &s;aw with new wonder the virtues of her mind, and who&s;e admiration of her excellencies, made his gratitude perpetual for the happine&s;s of his lot.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted Henrietta, in return|ing to her new friends, gave way, with art|le&s;s openne&s;s, to the violence of untamed grief; but finding Mr. Arnott as wretched
<PB N="396" REF="395">
as her&s;elf, the &s;ympathy Cecilia had fore|&s;een &s;oon endeared them to each other, while the little intere&s;t taken in either by Mrs. Harrel, made them almo&s;t in&s;eparable companions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, wearied by their melan|choly, and &s;ick of retirement, took the ear|lie&s;t opportunity that was offered her of changing her &s;ituation; &s;he married very &s;oon a man of fortune in the neighbour|hood, and, quickly forgetting all the pa&s;t, thoughtle&s;sly began the world again, with new hopes, new connections,&mdash;new equi|pages and new engagements!</P>
<P>Henrietta was then obliged to go again to her mother, where, though deprived of all the indulgencies to which &s;he was now become familiar, &s;he was not more hurt by the &s;eparation than Mr. Arnott. So &s;ad and &s;o &s;olitary his hou&s;e &s;eemed in her ab|&s;ence, that he &s;oon followed her to town, and returned not till he carried her back its mi&s;tre&s;s. And there the gentle gratitude of her &s;oft and feeling heart, engaged from the worthy Mr. Arnott the tendere&s;t af|fection, and, in time, healed the wound of his early and hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The injudicious, the volatile, yet noble|minded Belfield, to who&s;e mutable and en|terpri&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition life &s;eemed always ra|ther beginning than progre&s;&s;ive, roved from employment to employment, and from
<PB N="397" REF="396">
public life to retirement, &s;oured with the world, and di&s;contented with him&s;elf, till vanqui&s;hed, at length, by the con&s;tant friend&s;hip of Delvile, he con&s;ented to accept his good offices in again entering the army; and, being fortunately ordered out upon foreign &s;ervice, his hopes were revived by ambition, and his pro&s;pects were brightened by a view of future honour.</P>
<P>The wretched Monckton, dupe of his own cunning and artifices, &s;till lived in lin|gering mi&s;ery, doubtful which was mo&s;t acute, the pain of his wound and confine|ment, or of his defeat and di&s;appointment. Led on by a vain belief that he had parts to conquer all difficulties, he had indulged without re&s;traint a pa&s;&s;ion in which intere&s;t was &s;econded by inclination. Allured by &s;uch fa&s;cinating powers, he &s;hortly &s;uffered nothing to &s;top his cour&s;e; and though when he began his career he would have &s;tarted at the mention of actual di&s;honour, long before it was concluded, neither treachery nor perjury were regarded by him as &s;tumbling blocks. All fear of failing was lo&s;t in vanity, all &s;en&s;e of probity was &s;unk in intere&s;t, all &s;cruples of con&s;cience were left behind by the heat of the chace. Yet the unfore&s;een and melancholy cata|&s;trophe of his long arts, illu&s;trated in his de&s;pite what his principles had ob&s;cured,
<PB N="398" REF="397">
that even in worldly pur&s;uits where fraud out-runs integrity, failure joins di&s;honour to lo&s;s, and di&s;appointment excites triumph in&s;tead of pity.</P>
<P>The upright mind of Cecilia, her purity, her virtue, and the moderation of her wi&s;hes, gave to her in the warm affection of Lady Delvile, and the unremitting fondne&s;s of Mortimer, all the happine&s;s human life &s;eems capable of receiving:&mdash;yet human it was, and as &s;uch imperfect! &s;he knew that, at times, the whole family mu&s;t murmur at her lo&s;s of fortune, and at times &s;he mur|mured her&s;elf to be thus portionle&s;s, tho' an HEIRESS. Rationally, however, &s;he &s;urveyed the world at large, and finding that of the few who had any happine&s;s, there were none without &s;ome mi&s;ery, &s;he checked the ri&s;ing &s;igh of repining mortali|ty, and, grateful with general felicity, bore partial evil with chearfulle&s;t re&s;ignation.</P>
