<P>_THE Importunity of the Publi&s;her being very pre&s;|&s;ing, I omit the <HI>Preface</HI> which I intended, wherein I propos'd (by way of <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>) a Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>TRAGEDY:</HI> The Subject being too copious to treat of, in this &s;hort Time, I defer it, either to publi&s;h it &s;ingle, or to join it with &s;ome other Work.</P>
<P>But, my Gratitude prompts me to declare the Obligations I have to my Be&s;t and Deare&s;t Friend
<PB N="9" REF="7">
Mr. <HI>Aaron Hill,</HI> for his many judi|cious Corrections in this Tragedy. On that <HI>worthy Gentleman</HI> (who&s;e Mind is enrich'd with every noble Science, and in who&s;e Brea&s;t all the Virtues of Humanity are compri&s;ed) it will be my Pride, to offer my Sentiments, in a more di&s;tingui&s;hing Manner here|after.</P>
<P>I think it my Duty al&s;o, to return Thanks to the Town, for their fa|vourable Reception of this Play; and for the Applau&s;e their Indulgence be|&s;tow'd on the Performance of the <HI>Young Actors:</HI> Particularly for my own Succe&s;s, in a double Capacity, as <HI>Actor,</HI> and <HI>Author;</HI> I &s;hall ever <HI>pub|lickly</HI> confe&s;s <HI>their Genero&s;ity,</HI> as it will ever prove <HI>my &s;ecret Satisfac|tion.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;advantage this Play may have received, in the Repre&s;entation, I cannot omit acknow|ledging a Debt of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to
<PB N="10" REF="8">
Mr. <HI>Theophilus Cibber,</HI> who was very careful in the Management of the Rehear&s;als, and endeavour'd to in|&s;truct every one concern'd in the Play; a Mechani&s;m, which my Inexperience, as an <HI>Actor,</HI> made me incapable of.</P>
<P>Tho' an <HI>Author</HI> knows the Mean|ing of his Scenes, he may be unac|quainted with a <HI>Theatrical</HI> Method, of &s;etting 'em in the mo&s;t advanta|geous Appearance. <HI>Example enforces Precept:</HI> and therefore Mr. <HI>Cibber junior,</HI> took the noble&s;t Method, to improve others, by doing Ju&s;tice to his own Character; and, tho' he la|bours under the pre&s;ent Di&s;advantage of &s;mall Stature, I can't help concur|ring with the Opinion of many others, that, in <HI>Action,</HI> and <HI>Elocution,</HI> he is certainly a <HI>Prodigy.</HI></P>
