<HEAD>A TRANSLATION, OF Abb&eacute; GIRARD's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF &s;ociety be formed, by the com|munication of ideas and &s;entiments, &s;peech, is, undoubtedly, its mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential and mo&s;t graceful band, being, at once, the pencil of the mind, the image of its operations, and, the inter|preter of the heart. The more, we go
<PB N="8" REF="6">abroad, among men, the more, we per|ceive, that language, is the true &s;ea&s;on|ing of every delight. When all things el&s;e fail, or, when, through age, we have no other enjoyment, that of conver&s;a|tion, will furni&s;h amu&s;ement in our latter hours, and, will, at that time, grow more and more &s;atisfactory; as it will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make up for the want of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, we are in|capable of receiving. In all times, and, on all occa&s;ions, &s;peech is delightful: there can be no true happine&s;s, with|out the joys of the mind; no good fortune, that we do not long to make known; no &s;ecret, we do not wi&s;h to communicate; no tender &s;entiment, we are not anxious to declare; no &s;y&s;tem, we do not thir&s;t to unfold; no evil, we are not eager to complain of; no comfort, without the &s;ympa|thetic breathings of friend&s;hip; no re|putation, without the voice of renown;
<PB N="9" REF="7">in a word, nothing, without the aid of language, at lea&s;t, nothing, which can &s;atisfy our under&s;tandings, or, flatter our inclinations. Who then would be &s;o indolent, as, to pay no attention to the graces, or, &s;o wanting, as, to di&s;regard the power of one faculty, which gives lu&s;tre to every other? Apo|lite nation, can never entertain notions, injurious to true ta&s;te. Good education extends her care, equally, to the lan|guage of a people, as, their morals: &s;he does not confine her&s;elf, to the adorn|ing of the mind, inwardly, with wi&s;|dom, &s;cience, and, virtue; but, la|bours, al&s;o, to grace it, outwardly, by teaching it the art of &s;hewing it&s;elf to advantage. Her de&s;ire is, that our expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould corre&s;pond with our thoughts, and, that our reputation &s;hould be an&s;werable to our merit. Speech, then, de&s;erves our be&s;t atten|tion, and we ought to think our&s;elves
<PB N="10" REF="8">indebted to tho&s;e, who &s;tudy its culti|vation; whether by learned rules, drawn up according to its peculiar ge|nius, to give a knowledge of it, with preci&s;ion; or, by judicious critici&s;ms, in order, to pre&s;erve its purity, with|out rejecting the new advantages, of which, it is &s;u&s;ceptible; or, by &s;uch u&s;eful acqui&s;itions, as may enrich it, without rendering it unintelligible. But how much &s;hould we be obliged to that per&s;on, who could in any mea&s;ure fix it, and, put a &s;top to tho&s;e many innovations which mere caprice, daily, &s;trives to introduce? This is a ta&s;k, I fear, beyond the power of individuals: the de&s;tiny of whatever is living, for|bids its continuing, always, in the &s;ame &s;tate. However, be the fate of our language, in after-ages, as it may; neither the fear of its alteration, nor, even, its annihilation, &s;hall deter me from publi&s;hing the ob&s;ervations I have
<PB N="11" REF="9">made. They have neither the rules of grammar, nor the purity of cu&s;tom, for their object, but the delicate differ|ence, only, between words, reputed &s;y|nonymous; that is to &s;ay, the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of &s;uch words, as, re&s;embling each other, in their gene|ral idea, may, neverthele&s;s, be di&s;tin|gui&s;hable, one from another, by &s;ome additional one, peculiar to each of them; from whence ari&s;es, on many occa&s;ions, a nece&s;&s;ity of choice, in or|der to u&s;e them with propriety, and, elegance; a thing, as uncommon, as it is beautiful; and, by which ta&s;te is enabled to give brilliancy to truth, and, &s;olidity to wit. Avoiding all empty words, it teaches us to rea&s;on &s;oundly; aver&s;e to the abu&s;e of terms, it makes our diction intelligible; judicious in the choice of words, it gives ea&s;e and elegance to our expre&s;&s;ions: with the greate&s;t accuracy, it bani&s;hes all far|fetched,
<PB N="12" REF="10">vague and &s;piritle&s;s images, with which the trifling and &s;uperficial, are content to expre&s;s them&s;elves; an enemy to confu&s;ion, it prevents our rambling in the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences; in &s;hort, I will venture to affirm, that this &s;pirit of ju&s;tne&s;s and di&s;tinction, is the true ray that &s;hines; and, in con|ver&s;ation, is the lively touch, that di&s;|tingui&s;hes the man of delicacy and di&s;|cernment, from the vulgar and illite|rate.</P>
<P>In order to acquire this ju&s;tne&s;s, we mu&s;t be a little nice upon words, not imagining, that &s;uch, as are called &s;yno|nymous, are really &s;o, exactly uni|form in their &s;en&s;e, and, re&s;emble each other, as perfectly, as two drops of water from the &s;ame &s;pring: for, on a clo&s;er examination, we &s;hall &s;ee, that this re&s;emblance, does not take in the whole extent and force of &s;ignifica|tion; but con&s;i&s;ts, only, in one prin|cipal
<PB N="13" REF="11">idea, which, they all expre&s;s; each word differing from the other, by &s;ome relative one, which con&s;titutes its proper and particular character. That re&s;emblance, which conveys one gene|ral idea, makes, then, the words, &s;yno|nymous; and, the difference, that ari&s;es from the particular idea, that accom|panies the general, makes them, far from being perfectly alike, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing them, as various &s;hades of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>I will not, ab&s;olutely, &s;ay, that there are not occa&s;ions, on which, &s;o nice a choice may be di&s;pen&s;ed with; but, I maintain, that there are &s;till more, where they ought not, or, cannot pa&s;s one for another, e&s;pecially, in &s;tudied and elaborate compo&s;itions. I will allow it to be a matter of indifference, in choo&s;ing a yellow habit, whether we take the hue of the marigold or jonquil; but, would we make an
<PB N="14" REF="12">agreeable variety, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult the different &s;hades or tints: how &s;eldom, then, does it happen, that the mind, does not find it&s;elf, in &s;imi|lar circum&s;tances? Very rare indeed! as in that con&s;i&s;ts, the whole art of writing.</P>
<P>Le&s;t any one, under a fal&s;e notion, that the richne&s;s of a language con&s;i&s;ts, in the plurality and abundance of words, &s;hould explode this &s;y&s;tem of mine, relative to the dictinction of tho&s;e, re|puted &s;ynonymous; I mu&s;t &s;ay, that though language is enriched by an abundance of words, yet, that abund|ance is not merely numeral; which is fit for nothing, but, as it were, to fill the coffers of a mi&s;er; but, &s;uch as &s;prings from diver&s;ity, like that, which is ob&s;erved, in the various productions of nature. It is the &s;atisfaction of the mind, and, not the tickling of the ear, which is the object of all conver&s;ation
<PB N="15" REF="13">and writing; for which rea&s;on, the quantity of words, is not &s;o much to be e&s;teemed, as their quality. If they vary, only, from each other in their &s;ounds, and, not in their greater or le&s;s degrees of energy, comprehen&s;ion, preci&s;ion, &amp;c. they, in my opinion, &s;erve more to burthen the memory, than, enrich or facilitate the art of &s;peech. To &s;tand up for a number of words, without any regard to their &s;en&s;e, is, confounding abundance, with &s;uperfluity; &s;uch a ta&s;te, I cannot better compare, than, to that, of the ma&s;ter of a fea&s;t, who &s;hould think the magnificence of an entertainment, con|&s;i&s;ted more, in the number of di&s;hes, than, of eatables. Where is the great utility in having many terms to ex|pre&s;s one &s;ingle idea? Is there not more advantage in having proper ex|pre&s;&s;ions for every idea we can form?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14">It will be in vain for Pleona&s;m, to alledge in its defence, that by this abundance, we avoid the bad effects of repetition; for, we are deceived with re&s;pect to the cau&s;e of that effect; it is not the repeating of the &s;ame &s;ound, that offends &s;o much, as the repetition of the &s;ame idea. If the &s;ame word di&s;plea&s;es, when u&s;ed a &s;econd time, it is not, becau&s;e it hath already &s;truck the ear; but, becau&s;e it hath, before, af|fected the mind, which grows weary, and, is di&s;gu&s;ted, without the graces of novelty. Hence, came the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of certain words, we call Pro|nouns; the repetition of which, cu&s;tom hath made familiar, having given them no other office, than, &s;imply, to recall the matter in que&s;tion, without any redundancy of words. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, what we call Articles, and, Prepo&s;itions, are, equally, repeated without di&s;gu&s;t; nothing being ex|pected
<PB N="17" REF="15">from them, but, a bare nomina|tion or indication; for having nothing to determine of them&s;elves, they, al|ways, appear new, when the &s;ubject they indicate, is new. This is an un|deniable proof that the beauty of words, is more owing to their variety of mean|ings, than, to their different articula|tions; and, that 'tis a multiplicity of ideas, that produces, in effect, a multi|plicity of terms. If any one, yet, doubts this, he has nothing to do, but to ex|amine them a little clo&s;er, and, be a little nicer in his choice; or, without giving him&s;elf the trouble of &s;uch exa|mination, let him peru&s;e, only, with attention, the reflections here, laid be|fore him; for, be the remarks, either ju&s;t or not, they will, plainly, &s;hew, that, there are no words, &s;o perfectly, &s;ynonymous, as, to &s;ignify, exactly, the &s;ame, upon all occa&s;ions; con&s;equent|ly, they admit of a particular nicety
<PB N="18" REF="16">in choice. It is this choice, the fol|lowing &s;heets endeavour to determine, by definitions, and, examples, which di&s;tingui&s;h, and, di&s;clo&s;e the proper cha|racter of the&s;e words; in which, it is hoped, they will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the work it&s;elf, it may be &s;aid, without, either, vanity or affected mode&s;ty, that, it is copied from no one; neither was there any one to copy; if it, therefore, merits nothing, from the manner of its execution; it will, at lea&s;t, from its novelty: to this may be added that of variety; for, almo&s;t, every page, contains &s;omething differing from, and, independent of, that, which goes before, or, follows af|ter, although of the &s;ame &s;ort. Never book was, at the &s;ame time, more uni|form, and, more diver&s;i&s;ied: its peru&s;al needs not be, either, continued or regu|lar; let the reader open it, where he
<PB N="19" REF="17">will, he cannot fail of finding &s;ome|thing, and, that, entire; which will, at lea&s;t, &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity, if not content his under&s;tanding: it will &s;erve as well, to amu&s;e a quarter of an hour, as, em|ploy a whole day; and, may be taken up, and, laid a&s;ide, at any time.</P>

<P>The word <HI>abrogate,</HI> is generally u&s;ed with re&s;pect to ancient laws; <HI>repeal,</HI> to mo|dern: that is, when we talk of rendering old laws null, we call it <HI>abrogating;</HI> when tho&s;e lately made, <HI>repealing.</HI></P>
<P>De&s;potic power has frequently <HI>abrogated</HI> what was in&s;tituted by equity. Upon the

<P>We <HI>enlarge</HI> a town; a field; a garden. We <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the inhabitants of a town; our expences; our revenues.</P>

<P>To make this properly appear, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give a full definition of each.</P>
<P>By <HI>good-nature,</HI> is meant, that di&s;po&s;ition, which partakes the felicity of all mankind; that promotes the &s;atisfaction of every in|dividual, within the reach of its ability; that relieves the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, comforts the afflicted, diffu&s;es ble&s;&s;ings, and communi|cates happine&s;s, as far as its &s;phere of ac|tion can extend; whereas, <HI>good-humour</HI> is nothing more, than a chearful, plea&s;ing de|portment, ari&s;ing, either from a natural gaiety of mind, or, an affectation of popu|larity, joined to an affability of behaviour, which is the re&s;ult of good-breeding, and a compliance with the ta&s;te of every com|pany.&mdash;This kind of <HI>good-humour,</HI> is by far, the mo&s;t &s;triking quality; 'tis frequently mi&s;taken for, and complimented with, the &s;uperior name of real <HI>good-nature.</HI> A man, by this &s;pecious appearance, has often ac|quired that appellation, who, in all the ac|tions of his private life, has been a moro&s;e,

On the contrary, a man of a true benevo|lent di&s;po&s;ition, and formed, to promote the happine&s;s of all around him, may &s;ometimes, perhaps, from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or a com|mendable openne&s;s of heart, above the meanne&s;s of di&s;gui&s;e, be guilty of little &s;al|lies of peevi&s;hne&s;s or <HI>ill-humour,</HI> that may carry the appearance of, and be, unju&s;tly, thought to proceed from, <HI>ill-nature,</HI> by per|&s;ons who are not acquainted with his true character; and, who take them for &s;ynony|mous terms, tho', in reality, they have not the lea&s;t analogy to each other.</P>

<P>It is the law, which gives <HI>authority;</HI> it deriving all its might, from thence. <HI>Power,</HI> is inve&s;ted in delegates, tho&s;e, to whom the execution of the laws is entru&s;ted, and is, con&s;equently, in &s;ubordination to <HI>au|thority.

<P><HI>Authority,</HI> if weak, is expo&s;ed to con|tempt; it is, equally, as dangerous, not to make u&s;e of it on proper occa&s;ions, as, even, to abu&s;e it.

<P><PB N="152" REF="174">There appears to me, particularly, in the idea of <HI>authority,</HI> &s;omething ju&s;t and re|&s;pectable; in the idea of <HI>power,</HI> &s;omething &s;trong and active; and, in the idea of <HI>domi|uion,</HI> &s;omething great and elevated.</P>

<P>We borrow, with an intent to <HI>return;</HI> we take a thing in charge, with a view of <HI>&s;urrendering</HI> it again; but, we &s;eldom take, with a de&s;ign to <HI>re&s;tore.</HI></P>

<HEAD>206. <HI>Sincerity, Frankne&s;s, Plainne&s;s, Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Sincerity,</HI> prevents our &s;peaking, other|wi&s;e, than we think; and, is a virtue. <HI>Frank|ne&s;s,</HI> makes us &s;peak, as we think; and, is a natural effect. <HI>Plainne&s;s,</HI> is, &s;peaking, freely, what we think; and, &s;prings, &s;ome|times, from want of reflection. <HI>Ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> makes us declare what we know; and, is, often, a folly.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;incere</HI> man, will not deceive; a <HI>frank</HI> man, will not di&s;&s;emble; a <HI>plain</HI> man, is not apt to flatter; an <HI>ingenuous</HI> man, knows not how to conceal any thing.</P>
<P><HI>Sincerity,</HI> is of great value, in the inter|cour&s;e of the heart. <HI>Frankne&s;s,</HI> facilitates
<PB N="215" REF="237">the commerce of the world. <HI>Plainne&s;s,</HI> is, often, con&s;idered, as a want of politene&s;s. <HI>Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is, frequently, found to err, again&s;t prudence.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;incere,</HI> are, always, e&s;teemed. The <HI>frank,</HI> plea&s;e all the world. The <HI>plain,</HI> &s;ometimes, offend. The <HI>ingenuous,</HI> often, betray them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>207. <HI>Experiment, Trial, Proof.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Experiment,</HI> relates, properly, to the truth of things; it determines, whether a thing is, or, is not; clearing up of doubt, and, di&s;&s;ipating ignorance. <HI>Trial,</HI> concerns, particularly, the u&s;e of things; judging, whether they are proper, or, not; it &s;ettles the matter, and, determines the will. <HI>Proof,</HI> has a greater relation to the quality of things; teaching us, whether they are good, or, bad, di&s;tingui&s;hing the be&s;t, and, taking away any fear of being deceived.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="238">We make <HI>experiments,</HI> in order, to know; <HI>trials,</HI> to choo&s;e; and, <HI>proofs,</HI> to be, tho|roughly, acquainted with.</P>
<P><HI>Experiments,</HI> confirm our opinions; be|ing the root of knowledge. <HI>Trial,</HI> con|ducts our ta&s;te; being the road to &s;atisfac|tion. <HI>Proof,</HI> removes our fears; and, is a remedy again&s;t error and impo&s;ture.</P>
