<HEAD>THE HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have not, I hope, forgotten your old ac|quaintance idle Jack Brown, the fellow 'pren|tice of James Stock. I gave a little account of him and his wild tricks in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, from which I dare &s;ay you expect to hear no great good of him. The &s;econd part &s;hewed how James Stock, from a pari&s;h 'prentice, became a top &s;hoemaker. You &s;hall now hear what befel idle Jack, who, being a farmer's &s;on, had many advantages to begin life with. But he who wants prudence may be &s;aid to want every thing, becau&s;e he turns all his advantages to no account.</P>
<P>Jack Brown was ju&s;t out of his time when his ma&s;ter Williams died in that terrible drunken &s;it at the Greyhound. You know already how Stock &s;ucceeded to his ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s, and pro&s;pered in it. Jack wi&s;hed very much to enter into part|ner&s;hip with him. His father and mother too were
<PB N="4" REF="3">
de&s;irous of it, and offered to advance a hundred pounds with him. Here is a fre&s;h proof of the power of a good character! The old farmer, with all his covetou&s;ne&s;s, was eager to get his &s;on into partner&s;hip with Stock, though the latter was not worth a &s;hilling, and even his mother, with all her pride, was eager for it, for they had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee it would be the making of Jack. The father knew that Stock would look to the main chance; and the mother that he would take the labouring oar, and &s;o her darling would have little to do.</P>
<P>Stock, however, young as he was, "was too old a bird to be caught with chaff." His wi&s;dom was an overmatch for their cunning. He had a kindne&s;s for Brown, but would on no account enter into bu&s;ine&s;s with him. "One of the&s;e three things," &s;aid he, "I am &s;ure of if I do; he will either hurt my principles, my character, or my trade; perhaps all." And here, by-the-bye, let me drop a hint to other young men who are about to enter into partner&s;hip. Let them not do that in ha&s;te which they may repent at lei&s;ure. Next to marriage it is a tie the harde&s;t to break; and next to that it is an engagement which ought to be entered into with the utmo&s;t caution. Many things go to the making &s;uch a connexion &s;uitable, &s;afe, and plea&s;ant. There is many a top man need not be above taking a hint in this re&s;pect from James Stock the Shoemaker.</P>
<P>Brown was &s;till unwilling to leave him, indeed he was too idle to look out for bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o he offered Stock to work with him as a journeyman;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
but this he al&s;o mildly refu&s;ed. It hurt his good-nature to do &s;o; but he reflected that a young man who has his way to make in the world mu&s;t not only be good-natured, he mu&s;t be prudent al&s;o. "I am re&s;olved" &s;aid he "to employ none but the mo&s;t &s;ober, regular young men I can get. "Evil communications corrupt good manners," and I &s;hould be an&s;werable for all the di&s;orders of my own hou&s;e if I knowingly took a wild drinking young fellow into it. "That which might be kindne&s;s to one, would be inju&s;tice to many, and therefore a &s;in in my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Brown's mother was in a great rage when &s;he heard that her &s;on had &s;tooped &s;o low as to make this offer. She thought pride was a grand thing. Poor woman! She did not know that it was the meane&s;t thing in the world. It was her ignorance which made her proud, as is apt to be the ca&s;e. "You mean-&s;pirited ra&s;cal," &s;aid &s;he to Jack, "I had rather follow you to your grave, as well as I love you, than &s;ee you di&s;grace your family by working under Jem Stock the pari&s;h 'prentice." She forgot already what pains &s;he had taken about the partner&s;hip, but pride and pa&s;&s;ion have a bad memory.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay which was now uppermo&s;t in her mind, her de&s;ire to be revenged on Stock, or to &s;ee her &s;on make a figure. She rai&s;ed every &s;hilling &s;he could get from her hu&s;band, and all &s;he could crib from the dairy to &s;et up Jack in a &s;howy way. So the very next market-day &s;he came her&s;elf, and took for him the new white hou&s;e,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
with the two little &s;a&s;h windows painted blue, and blue po&s;ts before the door. It is that hou&s;e which has the old cro&s;s ju&s;t before it, as you turn down between the Church and the Greyhound. It's being &s;o near the Church to be &s;ure was no recommenda|tion to Jack, but it's being &s;o near the Greyhound was, and &s;o taking one thing with the other it was to be &s;ure no bad &s;ituation; but what weighed mo&s;t with the mother was, that it was a much more &s;howy &s;hop than Stock's, and the hou&s;e, though not half &s;o convenient, was far more &s;mart.</P>
<P>In order to draw cu&s;tom, his fooli&s;h mother ad|vi&s;ed him to under&s;ell his neighbours ju&s;t at fir&s;t to buy ordinary but &s;howy goods, and employ cheap workmen. In &s;hort, &s;he charged him to leave no &s;tone unturned to ruin his old comrade Stock. Indeed &s;he always thought with double &s;atisfaction of Jack's pro&s;perity, becau&s;e &s;he al|ways joined to it the hope that his &s;ucce&s;s would be the ruin of Stock, for &s;he owned it would be the joy of her heart to bring that proud up&s;tart to a mor&s;el of bread. She did not under&s;tand, for her part, why &s;uch beggars mu&s;t become Trade&s;men, it was "making a velvet pur&s;e of a &s;ow's ear."</P>
<P>Stock however &s;et out on quite another &s;et of principles. He did not allow him&s;elf always to &s;quare his own behaviour to others by their's to him. He &s;eldom a&s;ked him&s;elf what he &s;hould <HI>like</HI> to do: but he had a mighty way of &s;aying, "I won|der now what is my duty to do?" And when he was once clear in that matter be generally did it. So in&s;tead of &s;etting Brown at defiance; in&s;tead of
<PB N="7" REF="6">
all that vulgar &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, of "catch he that catch can"&mdash;and "two of a trade can never agree," he re&s;olved to be friendly towards him. In&s;tead of joining in the laugh again&s;t him for making his hou&s;e &s;o fine; he was &s;orry for him, becau&s;e he feared he would never be able to pay &s;uch a rent. So he very kindly called upon him, told him there was bu&s;ine&s;s enough for them both, and gave him many u&s;eful hints for his going on. He warned him to go oftner to Church and &s;eldomer to the Greyhound: Put him in mind how the following the one and for&s;aking the other had been the ruin of their poor ma&s;ter, and added the following</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ADVICE TO YOUNG TRADESMEN.</HEAD>
<P>Buy the be&s;t goods, cut the work out your&s;elf: let the eye of the ma&s;ter be every where; employ the &s;obere&s;t men; avoid all the low deceits of trade; never lower the credit of another to rai&s;e your own; make &s;hort payments, keep exact accounts; avoid idle company, and be very &s;trict to your word.</P>
<P>For a &s;hort time things went on &s;wimmingly. Brown was merry and civil. The &s;hop was well &s;ituated for go&s;&s;ip; and every one who had &s;ome|thing to &s;ay and nothing to do was welcome. Every idle &s;tory was fir&s;t &s;pread, and every idle &s;ong fir&s;t &s;ung in Brown's &s;hop. Every cu&s;tomer who came to be mea&s;ured was promi&s;ed that his &s;hoes &s;hould
<PB N="8" REF="7">
be done fir&s;t, But the misfortune was, if twenty came in a day the &s;ame promi&s;e was made to all; &s;o that nineteen were di&s;appointed and of cour&s;e affronted. He never &s;aid <HI>No</HI> to any one. It is indeed a word which it requires &s;ome hone&s;ty to pro|nounce. By all the&s;e fal&s;e promi&s;es he was thought the mo&s;t obliging fellow that ever made a &s;hoe. And as he &s;et out on the principle of under&s;elling, peo|ple took a mighty fancy to the Cheap Shop. And it was agreed among all the young and giddy, that he would beat Stock hollow, and that the old &s;hop would be &s;oon knocked up.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLISTENS.</HEAD>
<P>After a few months however folks began to be not quite &s;o fond of the Cheap Shop; one found out that the leather was bad, another that the work was &s;light. Tho&s;e who liked &s;ub&s;tantial goods went all of them to Stock's, for they &s;aid Brown's heel taps did not la&s;t a week; his new boots let in water, and they believed he made his &s;oles of brown paper. Be&s;ides it was thought by mo&s;t that his promi&s;ing all, and keeping his word with none&punc; hurt his bu&s;ine&s;s as much as any thing. Indeed I que&s;tion if lying ever an&s;wers in the long run.</P>
<P>Brown had what is commonly called <HI>a good heart;</HI> that is, he had a thoughtle&s;s good-nature, and a &s;ort of feeling for the moment which made him &s;eem &s;orry when others were in trouble. But he was
<PB N="9" REF="8">
not apt to put him&s;elf to any inconvenience, nor go a &s;tep out of his way, nor give up any plea&s;ure to &s;erve the be&s;t friend he had. He loved <HI>fun;</HI> and tho&s;e who do &s;hould always &s;ee that it be harm|le&s;s, and that they do not give up more for it than it is worth. I am not going to &s;ay a word again&s;t innocent merriment. I like it my&s;elf. But what the proverb &s;ays of gold, may be &s;aid of mirth, "it may be bought too dear." If a young man finds that what he fancies is a good joke may po&s;|&s;ibly offend GOD, hurt his neighbour, afflict his parent, or make a mode&s;t girl blu&s;h, let him then be a&s;&s;ured it is not fun but wickedne&s;s, and he had better let it alone.</P>
<P>Jack Brown then, as <HI>good a heart</HI> as he had, did not know what it was to deny him&s;elf any thing. He was &s;o <HI>good-natured</HI> indeed that he never in his life refu&s;ed to make one of a jolly &s;et; but he was not good-natured enough to con&s;ider that tho&s;e men whom he kept up all night roaring and laugh|ing had wives and children at home, who had little to eat, and le&s;s to wear, becau&s;e <HI>they</HI> were keeping up the character of merry fellows at the public hou&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE MOUNTEBANK.</HEAD>
<P>One day he &s;aw his father's plow boy come gal|loping up to his door in great ha&s;te. He brought Brown word that his mother was dangerou&s;ly ill,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and that his father had &s;ent his own be&s;t bay mare Smiler, that his &s;on might lo&s;e no time, but &s;et out directly to &s;ee his mother before &s;he died. Jack bur&s;t into tears, lamented the danger of &s;o fond a mother, and all the people in the &s;hop ex|tolled his <HI>good heart.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ent back the boy directly, with a me&s;&s;age that he would follow him in half an hour, as &s;oon as the mare had baited; for he well knew that his father would not thank him for any ha&s;te he might make if Smiler was hurt.</P>
<P>Jack accordingly &s;et off, and rode with &s;uch &s;peed to the next town, that both him&s;elf and Smiler had a mind to another bait. They &s;topped at the Star, unluckily it was Fair day, and as he was walking about while Smiler was eating her oats, a bill was put into his hand &s;etting forth, that on a &s;tage oppo&s;ite the Globe a Mountebank was &s;how|ing away, and his Andrew performing the fine&s;t tricks that ever were &s;een. He read&mdash;he &s;tood &s;till&mdash;he went on&mdash;"It will not hinder me," &s;ays he; "Smiler mu&s;t re&s;t, and I &s;hall &s;ee my poor dear mother ju&s;t as &s;oon if I ju&s;t take a peep, as if I &s;it moping at the Star."</P>
<P>The tricks were &s;o merry that the time &s;eemed &s;hort, and when they were over he could not for|bear going into the Globe and treating the&s;e choice &s;pirits with a bowl of punch. Ju&s;t as they were taking the la&s;t gla&s;s Jack happened to &s;ay that he was the be&s;t fives player in the country. "That is lucky," &s;aid the Andrew, "for there is a famous
<PB N="11" REF="10">
match now playing in the court, and you may never have &s;uch an opportunity to &s;how your &s;kill." Brown declared he could not &s;tay, for that he had left his hor&s;e at the Star, and mu&s;t &s;et off on urgent bu&s;ine&s;s. They now all pretended to call his &s;kill in que&s;tion. This rou&s;ed his pride, and he thought another half hour could break no &s;quares. Smiler had now had a good feed of corn, and he would only have to pu&s;h her on a little more; &s;o to it he went.</P>
<P>He won the fir&s;t game. This &s;purred him on: and he played till it was &s;o dark they could not &s;ee a ball. Another bowl was called for from the win|ner. Wagers and betts now drained Brown not only of all the money he had won, but of all he had in his pocket, &s;o that he was obliged to a&s;k leave to go to the hou&s;e where his hor&s;e was, to borrow enough to di&s;charge his reckoning at the Globe.</P>
<P>All the&s;e lo&s;&s;es brought his poor dear mother to his mind, and he marched off with rather a heavy heart to borrow the money, and to order Smiler out of the &s;table. The landlord expre&s;&s;ed much &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing him, and the o&s;tler declared there was no Smiler there; that he had been rode off above two hours ago by the Merry Andrew, who &s;aid he came by order of the owner Mr. Brown to fetch him to the Globe, and to pay for his feed. It was indeed one of the neate&s;t tricks the Andrew ever performed, for he had made &s;uch a clean conveyance of Smiler, that neither Jack nor his father ever heard of her again.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
It was night. No one could tell what road the Andrew took, and it was another hour or two be|fore an adverti&s;ement could be drawn up for ap|prehending the hor&s;e-&s;tealer. Jack had &s;ome doubts whether he &s;hould go on or return back. He knew that though his father might fear his wife mo&s;t, yet he loved Smiler be&s;t. At length he took that courage from a gla&s;s of brandy which he ought to have taken from a hearty repentance, and he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue his journey. He was obliged to leave his watch and &s;ilver buckles in pawn for a little old hack which was nothing but &s;kin and bone, and would hardly trot three miles an hour.</P>
<P>He knocked at his father's door about five in the morning. The family were all up. He a&s;ked the boy who opened the door how his mother was? "She is dead, "&s;aid the boy, "&s;he died ye&s;ter|day afternoon." Here Jack's heart &s;mote him, and he cried aloud, partly from grief, but more from the reproaches of his own con&s;cience, for he found by computing the hours, that had he come &s;trait on, he &s;hould have been in time to have received his mother's ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Farmer now called from within. "I hear Smiler's &s;tep. Is Jack come?" Yes father," &s;aid Jack in a low voice. Then," cried the Farmer, "run every man and boy of you and take care of the mare. Tom, do thou go and rub her down; Jem, run and get her a good feed of corn. Be &s;ure walk her about that &s;he may not catch cold." Young Brown came in. "Are you not an undu|tiful dog?" &s;aid the father, "You might have
<PB N="13" REF="12">
been here twelve hours ago. Your mother could not die in peace without &s;eeing you. She &s;aid it was a cruel return for all her fondne&s;s that you could not make a little ha&s;te to &s;ee her; but it was always &s;o, for &s;he had wronged her other chil|dren to help you, and this was her reward." Brown &s;obbed out a few words, but his father replied, "Never cry Jack, for the boy told me that it was out of regard for Smiler that you were not here as &s;oon as he was; and if 'twas your over care of her, why there's no great harm done. You could not have &s;aved your poor mother, and you might have hurt the mare." Here Jack's double guilt flew into his face. He knew that his father was very covetous, and had lived on bad terms with his wife; and al&s;o that his own unkindne&s;s to her had been forgiven out of love to the hor&s;e; but to break to him how he had lo&s;t that hor&s;e through his own &s;olly and want of feeling was more than Jack had courage to do. The old man, how|ever, &s;oon got at the truth, and no words can de|&s;cribe his fury. Forgetting that his wife lay dead above &s;tairs, he abu&s;ed his &s;on in a way not fit to be repeated; and though his covetou&s;ne&s;s had ju&s;t before found an excu&s;e for neglecting to vi&s;it a dying parent, yet he now vented his rage again&s;t Jack as an unnatural brute, whom he would cut off with a &s;hilling, and bade him never &s;ee his face again.</P>
<P>Jack was not allowed to attend his mother's funeral, which was a real grief to him; nor would h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s father advance even the little money which was needful to redeem his things at the Star. He had now no fond mother to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and he &s;et out on his
<PB N="14" REF="13">
return home on his borrowed hack full of grief. He knew he had al&s;o lo&s;t a little hoard of money which his mother had &s;aved up for him.</P>
<P>When Brown got back to his own town he found that the &s;tory of Smiler and the andrew had got thi|ther before him, and it was thought a very good joke at the Greyhound. He &s;oon recovered his &s;pirits as far as related to the hor&s;e, but as to his behaviour to his dying mother it troubled him at times to the la&s;t day of his life, though he did all he could to forget it. He did not however go on at all better, nor did he engage in one frolic the le&s;s for what had pa&s;&s;ed at the Globe.</P>
<P>Jack began at length to feel the rever&s;e of that proverb, "Keep your &s;hop and your &s;hop will keep you." He had neglected his cu&s;tomers, and they for&s;ook him. Quarter day came round; there was much to pay and little to receive. He owed two years rent. He was in arrears to his men for wages. He had a long account with his Currier. It was in vain to apply to his father. He had now no mother. Stock was the only true friend he had in the world, and had helped him out of many petty &s;crapes, but he knew Stock would advance no money in &s;o hople&s;s a ca&s;e. Duns came fa&s;t a|bout him. He named a &s;peedy day for payment, but as &s;oon as they were out of the hou&s;e, and the danger put off to a little di&s;tance, he forgot every promi&s;e, was as merry as ever, and run the &s;ame round of thoughtle&s;s gaiety. Whenever he was in trouble Stock did not &s;hun him, becau&s;e that was the moment he thought to throw in a little good advice. He one day a&s;ked him if he always intend|ed
<PB N="15" REF="14">
to go on in this cour&s;e? "No," &s;aid he, "I am re&s;olved by-and-bye to reform, grow &s;ober, and go to church. Why I am but five and twenty, man, I am &s;tout and healthy, and likely to live long, I can repent and grow melancholy and good at any time."</P>
<P>"Oh Jack," &s;aid Stock, "don't cheat thy&s;elf with that fal&s;e hope. What thou do&s;t intend to do, do quickly. Did&s;t thou never read about the heart growing hardened by long indulgence in &s;in? Some folk, who pretend to mean well, &s;how that they mean nothing at all, by never beginning to put their good re&s;olutions into practice; which made a wife man once &s;ay, that "hell is paved with good intentions."</P>
<P>Michaelmas day was at hand. The Landlord declared he would be put off no longer, but would &s;eize for Rent if it was not paid him on that day, as well as for a con&s;iderable &s;um due to him for leather. Brown now began to be frightened. He applied to Stock to be bound for him. This Stock flatly refu&s;ed. Brown now began to dread the horrors of a jail, and really &s;eemed &s;o very con|trite, and made &s;o many vows and promi&s;es of amendment, that at length Stock was prevailed on, together with two or three of Brown's other friends, to advance each a &s;mall &s;um of money to quiet the Landlord, Brown promi&s;ing to make over to them every part of his &s;tock, and to be guided in future by their advice, that he would turn over a new leaf, and follow Mr. Stock's example, as well as his directions in every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
Stock's good-nature was at la&s;t wrought upon, and he rai&s;ed the money. The truth is, he did not know the wor&s;t, nor how deeply Brown was in|volved, and Brown joyfully &s;et out at the very quarter day to a town at &s;ome di&s;tance to carry his Landlord the money rai&s;ed by the imprudent kindne&s;s of his friend. At his departure Stock put him in mind of the old &s;tory of Smiler and the Merry Andrew, and he promi&s;ed of his own head that he would not even call at a public hou&s;e till he had paid the money.</P>
<P>He was as good as his word. He very trium|phantly pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal. He &s;topped a little un|der the window of one where the &s;ounds of mer|riment and loud laughter caught his ear. At an|other he heard the enticing notes of a fiddle and the light heels of the merry dancers. Here his heart had well nigh failed him, but the dread of a jail on the one hand, and what he feared almo&s;t as much, Mr. Stock's anger on the other, &s;purred him on; and he valued him&s;elf not a little at hav|ing got the better of this temptation. He felt quite happy when he found he had reached the door of his landlord without having yielded to one idle inclination.</P>
<P>He knocked at the door. The maid who open|ed it &s;aid her ma&s;ter was not at home. "I am &s;orry for it," &s;aid he &s;trutting about, and with a boa&s;t|ing air took out his money. "I want to pay him my rent: he need not have been afraid of me." The &s;ervant, who knew her ma&s;ter was very much afraid of him, de&s;ired him to walk in, her ma&s;ter
<PB N="17" REF="16">
would be at home in half an hour. "I will call again," &s;aid he: "but no, let him call on me, and the &s;ooner the better: I &s;hall be at the Blue-Po&s;ts." While he had been talking he took care to open his black leather ca&s;e, and to di&s;play the Bank Bills to the &s;ervant, and then, in a &s;waggering way, he put up his money and marched off to the Blue Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>He was by this time quite proud of his own re&s;olution, and having tendered the money, and being clear in his own mind that it was the land|lord's own fault that it was not paid, he went to refre&s;h him&s;elf at the Blue Po&s;ts. In a barn belong|ing to this public hou&s;e &s;ome &s;trollers were ju&s;t going to perform &s;ome of that &s;ing-&s;ong ribaldry by which our villages are corrupted, the laws broken, and that money is drawn from the poor for plea&s;ure, which is wanted by their families for bread. The name of the la&s;t new &s;ong which made part of the entertainment, made him think him&s;elf in high luck, that he &s;hould have ju&s;t that half hour to &s;pare. He went into the barn, but was too much delighted with the actor who &s;ung his favourite &s;ong to remain a quiet hearer. He leaped out of the pit, and got behind the two ragged blankets which &s;erved for a curtain. He &s;ung &s;o much better than the actors them&s;elves, that they prai&s;ed and admired him to a degree which awakened all his vanity. He was &s;o in|toxicated with their flattery, that he could do no le&s;s than invite them all to &s;upper, an invitation which they were too hungry not to accept.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
He did not however quite forget his appoint|ment with his Landlord; but the half hour was long &s;ince pa&s;t by "And &s;o," &s;ays he, "as I know he is a mean curmudgeon, who goes to|bed I &s;uppo&s;e by day light to &s;ave candle, it will be too late to &s;peak with him to night&mdash;be&s;ides, let him call upon me; it is his bu&s;ine&s;s and not mine. I left word where I was to be found, the money is ready, and if I dont pay him to-night, I can do it before breakfa&s;t."</P>
<P>By the time the&s;e firm re&s;olutions were made &s;upper was ready. There never was a more jolly evening. Ale and punch were as plenty as water. The actors &s;aw what a vain fellow was fea&s;ting them; and as they wanted victuals, and he want|ed flattery, the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon &s;ettled. They ate and Brown &s;ung. They pretended to be in raptures. Singing promoted drinking, and every fre&s;h gla&s;s produced a &s;ong, or a &s;tory &s;till more merry than the former. Before morning tho&s;e who were engaged to act in another barn a dozen miles oft &s;tole away quietly. Brown having dropt a&s;leep they left him to fini&s;h his nap by him&s;elf: as to him his dreams were gay and plea&s;ant, and the hou&s;e being quite &s;till, he &s;lept comfortably till morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had breakfa&s;ted, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the night before popped into his head. He &s;et off once more to his landlord's in high &s;pirits, gaily &s;inging all the way &s;craps of all the tunes he had picked up the night before from his new friends. The landlord opened the door him&s;elf, and re|proached
<PB N="19" REF="18">
him with no &s;mall &s;urline&s;s for not hav|ing kept his word with him the evening before, adding, that he &s;uppo&s;ed he was come now with &s;ome more of his &s;hallow excu&s;es. Brown put on all that haughtine&s;s which is common to people who are generally in the wrong, when they catch them&s;elves doing a right action, and looked big, as &s;ome &s;ort of people do, when they have money to pay. "You need not have been &s;o anxious about your money," &s;aid he, "I was not going to break or run away." The Landlord knew this was the common language of tho&s;e who were ready to do both. Brown haughtily added,&mdash;"You &s;hall &s;ee I am a man of my word; give me a receipt." The Landlord had it ready and gave it him.</P>
<P>Brown put his hand in his pocket for his black leather ca&s;e where the bills were, he felt, he &s;earched, he examined, fir&s;t one pocket, then the other, then both wai&s;tcoat pockets, but no leather ca&s;e could he find. He looked terrified. It was the face of real terror. The Landlord con|ceived it to be that of guilt, and abu&s;ed him hear|tily for putting his old tricks upon him; he &s;wore he would not be impo&s;ed upon any longer, the money or a jail, there lay his choice.</P>
<P>Brown prote&s;ted for once with great truth, that he had no intention to deceive; that he had ac|tually brought the money, and knew not what was become of it; but the thing was far too un|likely to gain credit. Brown now called to mind that he had fallen a&s;leep on the &s;ettle in the room
<PB N="20" REF="19">
where they had &s;upped. This rai&s;ed his &s;pirits. He had no doubt but the ca&s;e had fallen out of his pocket, &s;aid he would &s;tep to the public-hou&s;e and &s;earch for it, and would be back directly. Not one word of all this did the landlord believe, &s;o inconvenient is it to have a bad character. He &s;wore Brown &s;hould not &s;tir out of his hou&s;e with|out a con&s;table, and made him wait while he &s;ent for one. Brown, guarded by the con&s;table, went back to the Blue Po&s;ts. The landlord charging the officer not to lo&s;e &s;ight of the culprit. The caution was needle&s;s, Brown had not the lea&s;t de|&s;ign of running away, &s;o firmly per&s;uaded was he that he &s;hould find his leather ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But who can paint his di&s;may, when no tale or tidings of the leather ca&s;e could be had. The ma&s;|ter, the mi&s;tre&s;s, the boy, and the maid of the public hou&s;e all prote&s;ted they were innocent. His &s;u&s;picious &s;oon fell on the &s;trollers with whom he had pa&s;&s;ed the night. And he now found out for the fir&s;t time that a merry evening did not always produce a happy morning. He obtained a warrant, and proper officers were &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the &s;trollers. No one however believed he had lo&s;t any thing. And as he had not a &s;hilling left to defray the expen&s;ive treat he had given, the ma&s;ter of the inn agreed with the other landlord in thinking this &s;tory was a trick to defraud both. Brown re|mained in clo&s;e cu&s;tody. At length the officer returned, who &s;aid they had been obliged to let the &s;trollers go, as they could not fix the charge on any one, and they had all offered to &s;wear before a ju&s;tice that they had &s;een nothing of the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
leather ca&s;e. And it was agreed that as he had pa&s;|&s;ed the evening in a crowded barn, he had pro|bably been robbed there of it all; and among &s;o many who could pretend to gue&s;s at the thief?</P>
<P>Brown raved like a madman, he cried and tore his hair, &s;aid he was ruined for ever. The abu|&s;ive language of his old landlord, and his new cre|ditor at the Blue Po&s;ts, did not lighten his &s;orrow. His landlord would be put off no longer. Brown declared he could neither find bail nor rai&s;e another &s;hilling, and as &s;oon as the forms of law were made out, he was &s;ent to the county jail.</P>
<P>Here it might have been expected that hard liv|ing and much lei&s;ure would have brought him to reflect a little on his pa&s;t follies. But his heart was not truly touched. The chief thing which grieved him at fir&s;t was, his having abu&s;ed the kind|ne&s;s of Stock, for to him he &s;hould appear guilty of a real fraud, where he had indeed been only vain, idle, and imprudent. And it is worth while here to remark that vanity, idlene&s;s, and imprudence, often bring a man to ruin both &s;oul and body, though &s;illy people do not put them in the cata|logue of heavy &s;ins, and tho&s;e who indulge them are often reckoned good hone&s;t merry fellows.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I had room to tell my readers what befel Jack in his pre&s;ent doleful habitation, and what became of him afterwards. I promi&s;e them how|ever, that they &s;hall certainly know the fir&s;t of next month, when I hope they will not forget to inquire for the Fourth Part of the Shoemakers, or Jack Brown in pri&s;on.</P>
