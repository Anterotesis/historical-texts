<PB REF="3">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ad duty of publi&s;hing the po&s;thumous works of a revered Parent having devolved on me, I now pre&s;ent the Public with two volumes of the continuation of the "OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE," which comprehend a view of the intere&s;ting countries of China, Japan, New Holland, and the Archipelago of the Indian Ocean.</P>
<P>As an editor, my chief care has been to tran&s;cribe with accuracy from the original manu&s;cript. The fini&s;hing touch of the ma&s;ter may be wanting; but the hand, alas! which gave the glowing tint is now cold, and who &s;hall dare to u&s;urp the pencil! Some trifling additions, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by an initial, have been made by my&s;elf; and to <HI>John Latham,</HI> E&s;quire, I am indebted for an augmentation to the catalogue of Birds of China, and of New Holland.
<PB N="vi" REF="4">An objection may be made by &s;ome, that no plates adorn the&s;e volumes&mdash;engravings, except of novel objects, or really illu&s;trative, and &s;uch, notwith&s;tanding much exertion, it was not my good fortune to procure, tend little to the value of a work of &s;cience. Two maps, pre&s;umed more requi&s;ite, have been con&s;tructed from the be&s;t materials.</P>
<P>The biography of the valued Author of the following &s;heets, having been given by him&s;elf in his "Literary Life," to the commencement of the year 1793, little remains for me to add. To that period his health and felicity had ex|perienced little interruption; the illne&s;s of an amiable daughter then began to embitter his days, and, after the mo&s;t unremitting attention that parental fondne&s;s could dictate, he felt the cruel pang of &s;eparation, on the fir&s;t of May 1794; this &s;hock his &s;pirits never completely recovered. In the April of the en&s;uing year, the patella of the knee &s;nap|ped, while de&s;cending a flight of &s;teps, an accident which confined him long to his room, yet, notwith&s;tanding his advanced age, and the bones never again reuniting, he re|covered
<PB N="vii" REF="5">&s;ufficiently not only to walk without difficulty, but to pur&s;ue his u&s;ual exerci&s;e on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The year 1796 gave to the world his "Account of the pari&s;hes of Whitford and Holywell." The infirmities of nature now began to &s;hew them&s;elves more evidently. The lo&s;s of a friend and neighbor, the worthy Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,</HI> the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tractions of the county of Flint by jarring politics, the melancholy &s;ituation of public affairs, the progre&s;s of Gallic barbari&s;m, which threatened to overturn all in&s;titutions &s;ocial and &s;acred, operated too forcibly on a mind of the acute&s;t feeling and mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility. Mental agitation affected the corporeal &s;y&s;tem; a difficulty of breathing, a cough, and other pulmonary affections in|duced him to apply for medical aid, and he received from his friend Dr. <HI>Haygarth,</HI> then re&s;ident at Che&s;ter, all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that art could give. Con&s;iderable di&s;charges of blood from the no&s;e increa&s;ed the alarming &s;ymptoms; &s;till the energy of his mind &s;u&s;tained it&s;elf; he continued his literary pur&s;uits, and employed his lei&s;ure hours, during the
<PB N="viii" REF="6">greate&s;t part of 1797, in preparing for the pre&s;s, and render|ing as perfect as po&s;&s;ible, his intere&s;ting "VIEW OF HIN|DOOSTAN," which was publi&s;hed early in the following year. OEdematous &s;wellings in the legs announced the fatal cau&s;e of his di&s;ea&s;e; but to expatiate more minutely on the &s;ad catalogue of human evils might be irk&s;ome; &s;uffice it then to &s;ay, that he bore their trial with fortitude and re&s;ignation; a natural &s;trength of con&s;titution, aided by a life of uni|form temperance, enabled him long to &s;truggle again&s;t in|firmity. The progre&s;s of the di&s;order becoming more rapid, towards the clo&s;e of October he collected his neare&s;t rela|tives, and received with them the my&s;terious &s;eal of our Redemption; con&s;cious of his approaching end, his eye beamed with hope, tempered by the mo&s;t &s;erene and digni|fied re&s;ignation; combining charity with devotion, he ob&s;erved, that the ceremony would be incomplete indeed, were it not accompanied by an act of beneficence to the poor. This was the la&s;t duty of religion he performed; his life had been a preparation for the aweful conclu&s;ion.
<PB N="ix" REF="7">Though &s;oon after reduced to the inability of moving, and &s;uffering much, he continued to &s;hare the conver&s;ation of his friends and relations, except during the extreme pre&s;&s;ure of pain, or when opiates, employed to procure a di&s;turbed &s;leep, or relieve the body from a few pangs, produced their powerful effect, and &s;acrificed the rea&s;oning powers and the nobler faculties of the &s;oul. On the 16th of December 1798, the powers of nature were exhau&s;ted, and the vene|rated author of my being expired without a groan!</P>
<P>The pen of a &s;on may not be calculated to record the character of an affectionate and beloved parent; the bias of natural affection may operate too forcibly, yet the &s;ilence of the per&s;on mo&s;t intimately acquainted with the various virtues of <HI>Thomas Pennant,</HI> would ju&s;tly draw down the reproach of ingratitude.</P>
<P>His religious principles were pure and fervent, yet exempt from bigotry; though firmly attached to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, he, by his writings and conduct, conciliated the e&s;teem of tho&s;e of a different per&s;ua&s;ion. A &s;teady
<PB N="x" REF="8">friend to our excellent con&s;titution, he ever labored to pre&s;erve it entire; this induced him to petition for the reform of &s;ome abu&s;es during the admini&s;tration of Lord <HI>North,</HI> at a period when the influence of the crown was &s;uppo&s;ed to have exceeded its due bounds; this brought him forward in later times, with additional energy, to re&s;i&s;t the democratic &s;pirit, which menaced tenfold evils. The duties of a magi&s;trate he exerci&s;ed with candor, with a temperate yet zealous warmth to protect the oppre&s;&s;ed. His benevolence to the poor was unbounded, his repeated exertions to relieve the wants of a populous neighbourhood, by the importation of corn, in times of &s;carcity, were truly munificent. Temperate in diet, he enjoyed the fruits of ab&s;tinence, and, until a few years previous to his decea&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unu&s;ual &s;hare of health and vigor. His conver|&s;ation was lively, replete with in&s;truction, and brilliant with &s;allies of true humour; yet too great &s;en&s;iblity at times lowered his natural flow of &s;pirits, and occa&s;ioned &s;evere dejection.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="9">Of his literary character the public is the impartial judge, and that public not only in this, but in foreign countries has fixed on it the &s;tamp of approbation. Ble&s;&s;ed with a me|mory the mo&s;t retentive, his powers of compo&s;ition were rapid; his works were generally printed, as they flowed from the pen, with little or no correction, hence, &s;ome in|accuracies may be expected, but their numbers are trifling.</P>
<P>Such, candid Reader! is the true but imperfect &s;ketch of the character of a man who to &s;uperior talents united the utmo&s;t goodne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Accept, &s;ainted &s;pirit! this unavailing tribute of filial duty! May the example of thy virtues &s;timulate my exer|tions! May my latter end re&s;emble thine!</P>

<HEAD>INDIA EXTRA GANGEM.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW enter on that portion of <HI>India</HI> which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>India</HI> beyond the <HI>Ganges.</HI> The di&s;tinction is comparatively modern, being known to the antients in an imperfect manner. Here and there are &s;cattered a few names, which they could only have collected from the <HI>Indian</HI> navi|gators; but I &s;hall mention in cour&s;e any other lights which I di&s;cover they might have received.</P>
<P>ADJOINING to <HI>Chittigong</HI> is the kingdom of <HI>Aracan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF ARACAN.</NOTE> which extends along the bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> about two hundred miles in a &s;outh-ea&s;tern direction. According to Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s map, a chain of mountains, beginning in the &s;outhern part of <HI>Chittigong</HI> &s;kirts the &s;ea the whole length of this kingdom, as well as that of <HI>Ava,</HI> to within a few leagues of <HI>Cape Negrais.</HI> The whole tract is infe&s;ted to a very great degree with elephants and bea&s;ts of prey. The topography of this country is very ob&s;cure. The mouth of the river <HI>Aracan,</HI> the <HI>Toco&s;annae</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER.</NOTE> is placed in Lat. 20&deg; 12&prime;. M. <HI>D'Anville</HI> gives its whole cour&s;e. Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> more cautious, and, perhaps, con&s;cious of the uncertainty, only
<PB N="2" REF="18">delineates a &s;mall part,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARACAN.</NOTE> or from the capital, <HI>Aracan,</HI> to the &s;ea. From <HI>Aracan,</HI> as high as Lat. 26&deg;, with the exception of a &s;mall portion between <HI>Malaac</HI> and <HI>Munnypour,</HI> where it is traver&s;ed by the great communication from <HI>Ava</HI> to the northern parts of <HI>Bengal,</HI> it is marked with a dotted line; from that point the river is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a certain cour&s;e, which is continued northward, in the kingdom of <HI>Thibet,</HI> as high as Lat. 30&deg; 10&prime;. All the great tract it pa&s;&s;es through is level, which makes it liable to annual inundations, from the &s;ame cau&s;es as affect the <HI>Bengal</HI> and other of the <HI>Indian</HI> plains. The tides which run up this river are very high; they come in with a great bore, and ri&s;e from fifteen to twenty feet, according to the influence of the moon.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;ix fathom water, according to Mr. <HI>Ovington</HI>'s ac|count, at the entrance of the river, and twenty farther up, &s;o that it forms a noble harbour. From the mouth to the capital is about fifty miles; mo&s;t of the way deliciou&s;ly bounded by woods or plantations, animated by the gambols of the monkey tribe, or the gay flights of numbers of peacocks. The city of <HI>Aracan</HI> is &s;eated mo&s;t &s;ingularly, in a valley &s;urrounded with va&s;t and craggy mountains. The&s;e are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, &s;o as to prove the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial fortifications. The entrances are cut through the &s;olid rock, as are the gates of the city. The precipitous face of the mountains &s;erves for walls; be&s;ides the&s;e, it has a citadel, and other artificial defences. The city is &s;aid to be fifteen miles in circumference, and to contain a hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and inhabitants. The regal palace is very magnificent, and highly adorned and enriched with works of ma&s;&s;ive gold.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="19">IN my
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, vol. ii. p. 372.</NOTE> account of <HI>Chittigong,</HI> in the preceding volume, I have related the &s;hare this kingdom took in the affairs of <HI>Hindoo&s;tan,</HI> by rea&s;on of the &s;upport it gave the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> pirates. I &s;hall now take notice of a very remarkable event which befel <HI>Aracan,</HI> the re&s;ult of the misfortunes of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SULTAN SULJAH.</NOTE> the &s;econd &s;on of the emperor <HI>Shah Jehan,</HI> and the unfortunate brother of that &s;uc|ce&s;sful hypocrite <HI>Aurengzebe.</HI> After <HI>Sujah</HI> had long made head again&s;t the u&s;urper, he was at length obliged to retire from his fa&s;tne&s;s near <HI>Monghier</HI> to <HI>Dacca,</HI> and from thence to the king|dom of <HI>Aracan.</HI> He had previou&s;ly &s;ent his &s;on to the king of the country, to implore his protection. This was imme|diately promi&s;ed, and the unhappy prince embarked with his whole family on board the ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> pirates, &s;et|tled in the mouths of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> intending to profit of the favor of the infidel monarch, till he could procure a &s;hip to convey him to the holy city of <HI>Mecca.</HI> From thence he in|tended to go to the courts of <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in hopes of an a&s;ylum in one or other of the dominions of tho&s;e mighty poten|tates. <HI>Sujah</HI> is &s;aid &s;oon to have di&s;covered the perfidy of his royal ho&s;t, who had entered into a treaty with the General of <HI>Aurengzebe,</HI> to deliver into his hands, for a &s;um of money, the fugitive &s;ultan. This came to the ears of that prince, who ra&s;hly determined on revenge. He entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the <HI>Aracan</HI> monarch, gained over a certain number of <HI>Maho|metans</HI> re&s;ident in the country, and with tho&s;e, and the few who were left of his train, re&s;olved to force his way into the palace, to kill the king, and cau&s;e him&s;elf to be proclamed &s;overeign.
<PB N="4" REF="20">All this might have been executed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARACAN.</NOTE> had not the de&s;ign been di&s;|covered. The unhappy <HI>Sujah</HI> attempted to e&s;cape towards <HI>Pegu;</HI> he was &s;oon overtaken. His &s;on, &s;ultan <HI>Banque,</HI> defended him|&s;elf with a courage worthy of his birth, till overpowered with numbers, and fainting under his wounds, he was &s;eized, and with his two little brothers, his &s;i&s;ters, and his mother, car|ried away. As to <HI>Sujah,</HI> he, with one woman, an eunuch, and two other per&s;ons, in a&s;cending a mountain, was knocked down with a &s;tone by his pur&s;uers. The eunuch bound up his wounded head with a turban, and they both e&s;caped into the woods. Many relations were &s;pread re&s;pecting this event. In general he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have died either fami&s;hed with hunger, or fallen a prey to wild bea&s;ts.

<P>THE tragical relation does not end here. Sultan <HI>Banque,</HI> and other fugitives who were brought back, were at fir&s;t treated with a tolerable degree of lenity; the king even took to wife one of <HI>Sujah</HI>'s daughters. This did not prevent <HI>Banque</HI> and his companions from entering into another con&s;piracy, which was detected. The king of <HI>Aracan</HI> determined to root out this ill|fated family; he cau&s;ed the heads of the men to be cut off with blunt axes, the women to be immured, and &s;tarved to death; the lady alone whom he had honored with his bed was &s;aved.</P>
<P>THE great quantity of gold and diamonds which had been brought into the country by <HI>Sujah,</HI> proved the cau&s;e of dreadful
<PB N="5" REF="21">wars between the two &s;ons of the king of <HI>Aracan,</HI> who &s;uc|ceeded him in 1690; they quarrelled about the divi&s;ion of the trea&s;ure, and never cea&s;ed from conte&s;ting the prize till both the competitors were de&s;troyed. Many of the diamonds (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) were afterwards &s;old to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who happened to touch at <HI>Aracan,</HI> at very low prices, by rea&s;on of the ignorance of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>

No people are &s;o expert as the <HI>Malayes</HI> in that dreadful art. The city was al&s;o defended by three thou&s;and cannon, a number of artillery &s;urpri&s;ing in tho&s;e days. The monarch fled to the woods, where he &s;oon died of grief. This &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Albuquerque</HI>'s &s;truck all the neighboring nations with admiration.

<P>THE <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> from time to time fortified <HI>Malacca</HI> in a manner &s;uitable to its importance, and it became the greate&s;t em|porium in <HI>India.</HI> By this wi&s;e &s;troke of policy, <HI>Albuquerque</HI> gave to his country the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gold, the gems, the &s;pices,
<PB N="27" REF="43">and other rich productions of <HI>India ultra Gangem,</HI> and its i&s;lands, as he did before tho&s;e of <HI>Hindoo&s;tan,</HI> by the capture of the famous city of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Malacca</HI> till the year 1641,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXPELLED BY THE DUTCH.</NOTE> when it was wre&s;ted out of their hands by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> after a &s;ix months &s;iege. The governor is accu&s;ed by hi&s;torians of treachery, and to have been bribed into a &s;urrender; but it is certain that he did not give the place up till after the mo&s;t gallant defence. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of its value, paid the utmo&s;t attention to its fortifications, and to every thing that could revive the antient commerce, which had almo&s;t &s;unk to nothing, by the tyranny and u&s;ual ill conduct of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE city had in their time &s;everal fine churches, and num|bers of mona&s;teries; and the Je&s;uits a noble college, in which they exerci&s;ed great ho&s;pitality. All the&s;e of cour&s;e fell to decay under the reign of the &s;ons of <HI>Calvin.</HI> Sharp as they are, they were outwitted by the &s;ons of <HI>Rome:</HI> the religious of the &s;everal convents made a reque&s;t to the conqueror, that they might be permitted to quit their hou&s;es in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion; each carried a large waxen taper in his hand, within which were concealed their diamonds, and all the le&s;&s;er trea&s;ures. The vic|tors were defrauded of the fruits of their valor, and, as <HI>Son|nerat</HI> &s;ays, their commander lo&s;t his head, on his return to <HI>Holland,</HI> for not having &s;agacity enough to di&s;cover the trick.</P>
<P><HI>Malacca</HI> is exceedingly large; much of it is built of &s;trong bamboo, but the &s;everal &s;tone buildings, among them the gover|nor's hou&s;e, make a con&s;picuous figure. A narrow but deep and
<PB N="28" REF="44">rapid river divides the town from the fort, one &s;ide of which is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea; in that part only four leagues di&s;tant from the low land of <HI>Sumatra. Malacca</HI> is a true emporium, or mart, the great magazine of the various rich articles of commerce brought from the &s;everal countries I have mentioned. As to the penin&s;ula it&s;elf, it yields little more than the &s;ine tin and elephants' teeth. Let me conclude, that this place was celebrated among the an|tients for its gold,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AUREA CHER|SONESUS.</NOTE> for which rea&s;on it was called by them <HI>Aurea Cher&s;one&s;us;</HI> &s;till, at no great di&s;tance from the city of <HI>Ma|lacca,</HI> is a hill called the <HI>Golden Mount.</HI> Some imagine this to have been the <HI>Ophir</HI> of <HI>Solomon.</HI> I &s;hall mention, in vol. of the Outlines of the Globe, the &s;uppo&s;ition that <HI>Ophir</HI> was a place in <HI>Aethiopia.</HI> I will not enter into the di&s;pute, and only &s;ay, that if the birds which we know at pre&s;ent by the name of pea|cocks, were tho&s;e intended

<P>FOR the tracing the remainder of the coa&s;ts on the continent, I &s;hall no more con&s;ult the opinion of my able guide, M. <HI>D'An|ville,</HI> but follow that of a countryman, Mr. <HI>John Caverhill,</HI> who, in the lviith volume of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, has given a very able critici&s;m on tho&s;e parts of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> which relate to the&s;e particular &s;hores.</P>

<Q>is the penin&s;ula of <HI>Malacca,</HI> a country for|merly well peopled, and con&s;equently well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greate&s;t powers, and made a very con&s;iderable figure on the theatre of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The &s;ea was covered with their &s;hips, and they carried on a mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce. Their laws, however, were apparently very dif|ferent from tho&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;t among them at pre&s;ent.

I &s;hall endeavor to give you an idea of tho&s;e laws, and tho&s;e manners; you will, from thence, ea&s;ily judge of their agriculture.</Q></P>
<P><Q>TRAVELLERS who make ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Malais,</HI> are a&s;toni&s;hed to find, in the center of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> under the &s;corching climate of the line, the laws, the manners, the cu&s;toms, and the prejudices of the antient inhabitants of the north of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> The <HI>Malais</HI> are governed by feudal laws, that capri|cious &s;y&s;tem, conceived for the defence of the liberty of a few again&s;t the tyranny of one, whil&s;t the multitude is &s;ubjected to &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A CHIEF, who has the title of king or &s;ultan, i&s;&s;ues his commands to his great va&s;&s;als, who obey when they think proper; the&s;e have inferior va&s;&s;als, who often act in the &s;ame manner with regard to them.

<P><Q>WITH the&s;e laws the <HI>Malais</HI> are re&s;tle&s;s, fond of navigation,
<PB N="35" REF="51">war, plunder, emigrations, colonies, de&s;perate enterpri&s;es, ad|ventures, and gallantry. They talk ince&s;&s;antly of their ho|nor, and their bravery, whil&s;t they are univer&s;ally con&s;idered, by tho&s;e with whom they have intercour&s;e, as the mo&s;t treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe; and yet, which appeared to me extremely &s;ingular, they &s;peak the &s;ofte&s;t language of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> That which the Count <HI>de Forbin</HI> has &s;aid in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars,</HI> is exactly true, and is the reigning characteri&s;tic of the whole <HI>Malay</HI> nations; more attached to the ab&s;urd laws of their pre|tended honor, than to tho&s;e of ju&s;tice or humanity, you al|ways ob&s;erve, that among&s;t them, the &s;trong oppre&s;s and de|&s;troy the weak; their treaties of peace and friend&s;hip never &s;ub&s;i&s;ting beyond that &s;elf-intere&s;t which induced them to make them, they are almo&s;t always armed, and either at war among&s;t them&s;elves, or employed in pillaging their neigh|bors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS ferocity, which the <HI>Malais</HI> qualify under the name of courage, is &s;o well known to the <HI>European</HI> companies, who have &s;ettlements in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that they have univer&s;ally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their &s;hips, who may put into the <HI>Malay</HI> i&s;lands, from taking on board any &s;eamen of that nation, except in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and then, on no account to exceed two or three.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT is nothing uncommon for a handful of the&s;e horrid &s;avages &s;uddenly to embark, attack a ve&s;&s;el by &s;urpri&s;e, poignard in hand, ma&s;&s;acre the people, and make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of her. <HI>Malay</HI> batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty
<PB N="36" REF="52">men, have been known to board <HI>European</HI> &s;hips of thirty or forty guns, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and murder, with their poignards, great part of the crew. The <HI>Malay</HI> hi&s;tory is full of &s;uch enterpri&s;es, which mark the de&s;perate ferocity of the&s;e barbarians.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Malais</HI> who are not &s;laves go always armed, they would think them&s;elves di&s;graced if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <HI>Crit;</HI> the indu&s;try of this nation even &s;urpa&s;&s;es it&s;elf, in the fabric of this de&s;tructive weapon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tu|mult, they could never endure the long flowing habits which prevail among&s;t the other <HI>A&s;iatics.</HI> The habits of the <HI>Malais</HI> are exactly adapted to their &s;hapes, and loaded with a multi|tude of buttons, which fa&s;ten them clo&s;e to their bodies in every part. I relate the&s;e &s;eemingly trifling ob&s;ervations, in order to prove, that in climates the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, the &s;ame laws produce &s;imilar manners, cu&s;toms, and prejudices; their effect is the &s;ame too with re&s;pect to agriculture.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Malais</HI> are, in general, of a &s;u|perior quality; nature &s;eems to have taken plea&s;ure in there a&s;&s;embling her mo&s;t favorite productions. They have not only tho&s;e to be found in the territories of <HI>Siam,</HI> but a variety of others peculiar to the&s;e i&s;lands. The country is covered with odoriferous woods, &s;uch as the eagle or aloes wood, the &s;andal, and the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia Odorata,</HI> a &s;pecies of cinnamon: you there breathe an air impregnated with the odors of innumerable flowers of the greate&s;t fragrance, of which there is a perpe|tual

<P><Q>Departing, &s;ays M. <HI>Le Poivre,</HI> from the penin&s;ula of <HI>Ma|lacca,</HI> and the i&s;lands of the <HI>Malais,</HI> towards the north, I fell in with a &s;mall territory called <HI>Cancar,</HI> but known on the ma|ritime charts under the name of <HI>Ponthiamas.</HI> Surrounded by the kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> where de&s;poti&s;m and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of <HI>Camboya,</HI> where no idea of e&s;tabli&s;hed government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; and the territories of the <HI>Malais,</HI> who&s;e genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad; this charming
<PB N="50" REF="66">country, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated and almo&s;t de&s;titute of inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> merchant, commander of a ve&s;&s;el which he em|ployed in commerce, frequented the&s;e coa&s;ts; being a man of that intelligent reflective genius, which &s;o characteri&s;tically marks his nation, he could not, without pain, behold immen&s;e tracts of ground condemned to &s;terility, though naturally more fertile than tho&s;e which formed the riches of his own country; he formed, therefore, a plan for their improvement: with this view, having fir&s;t of all hired a number of la|borers, &s;ome <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> others from the neighboring nations, he, with great addre&s;s, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the favor of the mo&s;t powerful princes, who, for a certain &s;ub&s;idy, a&s;&s;igned him a guard for his protection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN the cour&s;e of his voyage to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and the <HI>Philippine</HI> i&s;lands, he borrowed from the <HI>Europeans</HI> their mo&s;t u&s;eful di&s;|coveries and improvements, particularly the art of fortifica|tion and defence; with regard to internal police, he gave the preference to the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> The profits of his commerce &s;oon enabled him to rai&s;e ramparts, &s;ink ditches, and provide ar|tillery; the&s;e preliminary precautions &s;ecured him from a <HI>coup de main,</HI> and protected him from the enterprizes of the &s;urrounding nations of barbarians.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE di&s;tributed the lands to his laborers, without the lea&s;t re&s;ervation of any of tho&s;e duties or taxes known by the names of &s;ervice, or fines of alienation; duties which, by allowing no real property, become the mo&s;t fatal &s;courge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts again&s;t the common &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="51" REF="67">every wi&s;e nation. He provided his coloni&s;ts at the &s;ame time with all &s;orts of in&s;truments proper for the labor and improve|ment of their grounds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN forming a laboring, and commercial people, he thought that no laws ought to be framed, but tho&s;e which nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed for the human race in every climate; he made the&s;e laws re&s;pected by obeying them fir&s;t him&s;elf, and exhi|biting an example of &s;implicity, indu&s;try, frugality, humanity, and good faith: he formed, then, no &s;y&s;tem of laws&mdash;he did more&mdash;he e&s;tabli&s;hed morals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HIS territories &s;oon became the country of every indu&s;tri|ous man who wi&s;hed to &s;ettle there; his port was open to all nations. The woods were cleared, the grounds judiciou&s;ly labored, and &s;own with rice; canals cut from the rivers wa|tered their fields; and plentiful harve&s;ts, after &s;upplying them with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, furni&s;hed an object of exten&s;ive commerce. His integrity, his moderation, and his humanity, made him re|&s;pected. He never wi&s;hed to reign, but only to e&s;tabli&s;h the empire of rea&s;on; his &s;on, who now fills his place, inherits his virtues as well as his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; by agriculture, and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands, he has become &s;o powerful, that the barbarians, his neighbors, &s;tile him king, a title which he de&s;pi&s;es: he pretends to no right of &s;overeignty, but the noble&s;t of all, that of doing good; happy in being the fir&s;t laborer and the fir&s;t merchant of his country, he merits, as well as his father, a title more glorious than that of king&mdash;the friend of mankind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE barbarians of the neighborhood, amazed to &s;ee abun|dance
<PB N="52" REF="68">&s;o &s;uddenly &s;ucceed to &s;terility, flocked for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the magazines of <HI>Ponthiamas;</HI> who&s;e dominions, at this day, are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t plentiful granary of that ea&s;tern part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> the <HI>Malais,</HI> the <HI>Cochin Chine&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> who&s;e countries are naturally &s;o fertile, con&s;idering this little terri|tory as the mo&s;t certain re&s;ource again&s;t famine.</Q></P>
<P>LET me here add, that our plain <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who vi&s;ited <HI>Ponte|amas</HI> in 1720, found the town in ruins. It had been taken and plundered in the year 1717 by the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> fleet, at which time it was a place of con&s;iderable trade. It may have recovered by the time M. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> was there, &s;o as to vindicate his enthu&s;ia&s;tic account. The town is &s;eated on a deep but narrow river, which in the &s;ea&s;on of inundations communicates with that of <HI>Meinam Kom,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMBODIA.</NOTE> or <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and the city of the &s;ame name on its banks; by which means the commodities of the kingdom are &s;ent to this port, in preference to that at the mouth of the <HI>Cambodia,</HI> which is &s;aid to be of very trouble&s;ome navigation, by rea&s;on of the numbers of low i&s;lands and &s;and banks which ob&s;truct the channel.</P>
<P>IT is highly probable that &s;uch was the &s;tate of this river from the very early times; we find no antient port at this place, but learn from <HI>Ptolemy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CATTIGARA.</NOTE> that one, called <HI>Cattigara Sinarum Statio,</HI> &s;tood on or near the &s;cite of <HI>Ponteamas,</HI> on a mar&s;hy coa&s;t, pro|ductive of reeds <HI>(bamboos)</HI> &s;o large, that when they were joined and tied together, pa&s;&s;engers were enabled to cro&s;s from one &s;ide to the other.</P>

<P>THE chief river of the country is called the river of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> which empties it&s;elf into the bay by two channels, one called <HI>Rok-ho,</HI> the other twenty leagues to the north-ea&s;t, which <HI>Dam|pier</HI> named that of <HI>Domea.</HI> The fir&s;t, frequented by the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, has not above twelve feet water at the entrance, and is the mo&s;t convenient for the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> The other is u&s;ed by the <HI>European</HI> &s;hips on account of the depth. Before the mouth is a line of hard &s;and two miles long; the entrance is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a high ridgy mountain far up the country called the <HI>Elephant.</HI> About &s;ix leagues from the mouth of the river is the village of <HI>Domea,</HI> u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred hou&s;es, yet on the arrival of the <HI>European</HI> &s;hips it &s;oon increa&s;es to a large town; the natives re&s;ort for &s;ake of trade from all parts; hou&s;es &s;uddenly &s;pring up; for being only con&s;tructed of frames of bamboo, and the roof of palm or other leaves, a tem|porary town is quickly formed, in which a fair is kept as long as the &s;hips remain in the harbor.</P>
<P>THE river is &s;ubject to the &s;ame periodical floods as others in the tropical regions; and the &s;ame fertility is the con&s;equence. The wet &s;ea&s;on commences the latter end of <HI>April</HI> or beginning of <HI>May,</HI> and la&s;ts till towards the clo&s;e of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> The rains are intermittent; &s;ome are of two or three days continuance, others of only a few hours, with intervals of fine weather, e&s;pecially

<P>THE <HI>Typhons,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TYPHONS.</NOTE> or as <HI>Dampier</HI> calls them <HI>Tuffoons,</HI> are mo&s;t tremendous in this bay and on the coa&s;t of <HI>China.</HI> They pre|vale in the months of <HI>July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> and com|monly near the change of the moon. They are preceded by very fine weather; a pre&s;aging cloud appears in the north-ea&s;t, black near the horizon, edged with copper color, on the upper part fading into a glaring white. It often exhibits a gha&s;tly appearance twelve hours before the <HI>Typhon</HI> bur&s;ts; its rage la&s;ts many hours from the north-ea&s;t, attended with dreadful claps of thunder, large and frequent fla&s;hes of lightning, and ex|ce&s;&s;ive hard rains; then it &s;inks into a dead clam; after which it begins again with redoubled rage from the &s;outh-we&s;t, and continues an equal length of time.</P>
<P>THE great <HI>Halley</HI> gives an account of the &s;urpri&s;ing tides in this bay;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE> each flux is of twelve hours duration, and its re-flux the &s;ame, &s;o that there occurs but one high water in twenty-four hours. The great Philo&s;opher &s;hall &s;peak in his own words:</P>
<P><Q>ON the fir&s;t and &s;econd days, at the water's increa&s;e, the in|fluxes are very &s;mall and uncertain, but afterwards the tides for thirteen days are con&s;tant in their cour&s;e, one flood and one ebbing being completed in twenty-four hours time, equally &s;haring the &s;pace of a lunar circuition of the earth between them, and every flood beginning neare&s;t three quarters of an hour later than the precedent flood, and al&s;o con&s;iderably in|crea&s;ing in the height of the tide every day, from the third unto

<P><HI>Cachao,</HI> the principal city of <HI>Tonquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF CACHAO.</NOTE> lies about eighty miles higher up the river, and is the place where the chief trade is carried on. The imports are conveyed from the &s;hips in large <HI>Tonquine&s;e</HI> boats, navigated by the natives. The tide runs with great rapidity thirty or forty miles above <HI>Domea,</HI> through a rich and beautiful plain; near <HI>Hean,</HI> a town of two thou&s;and hou&s;es, is the place where the two channels meet, and form the <HI>Delta</HI> of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> about eighty miles from the &s;ea. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> mer|chants have a &s;treet to them&s;elves at <HI>Hean.</HI> For a time they re|&s;ided at <HI>Cachao,</HI> but became &s;o numerous that they &s;eemed to &s;wallow up the very natives; the king therefore ordered them to remove here. The <HI>French</HI> al&s;o had a factory in this town in <HI>Dampier</HI>'s time. Is is from that hone&s;t voyager I take my ac|count, having no later authority of any authenticity. The <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> and <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> jonks come up as high as the town, and ride in the middle of the river.</P>
<P><HI>Cachao</HI> is a city of twenty thou&s;and hou&s;es; the walls u&s;ually made of mud and thatch, but &s;ome are of brick, covered with
<PB N="78" REF="94">tiles. Here are three regal places; two very mean, the third more magnificent, but built of timber, and open at the &s;ides. This, with the courts, fi&s;h-ponds, and docks for the plea&s;ure boats, take up a va&s;t &s;pace of ground, &s;urrounded by a wall faced with brick. There are &s;everal gates, and &s;tairs to a&s;cend to the top of the walls, round which is a plea&s;ant walk. This place is the re&s;idence or rather pri&s;on of the <HI>Boua,</HI> or em|peror of <HI>Tonquin.</HI> In this country is a mo&s;t &s;ingular govern|ment; by a revolution which happened long ago, the general of the reigning monarch made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the empire; he a&s;&s;umed all the regal power, and &s;eized the whole revenue, but did not venture to extirpate the royal family, for fear of the af|fection the people entertained for their antient rulers. The executive power is lodged in the general or his heirs, who is called <HI>Choua;</HI> he is quite ab&s;olute, has his guards, and all the in&s;ignia of maje&s;ty. The <HI>Boua</HI> is kept as a &s;tate pri&s;oner, with his wives and children, and diverts him&s;elf within the palace walls, for he is never allowed to &s;tir out. The <HI>Choua</HI> pays him all external re&s;pects, vi&s;its him three times a year, gives him the precedence, makes him a tender of his life and &s;ervices, and de|clares that all he does is in kindne&s;s, to &s;ave him the fatigues of government.

<P>THEY <HI>(the Tonquine&s;e)</HI> take of the be&s;t mu&s;k about gr. xvi. of the pure&s;t native cinnabar, and fine&s;t vermillion, each about gr. xxiv. and, having reduced them &s;eparately to impalpable pow|ders, mix and admini&s;ter them in about a gill of arrack; which, in two or three hours, generally throws the patient into a &s;ound &s;leep and per&s;piration; if not, they repeat the do&s;e, and think the cure certain.</P>
<P>THE religion of this country is the &s;ame with that of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE> but idolatry appears here with much le&s;s magnificence; the <HI>Pagodas</HI> are mean, and their images numerous. It &s;hould &s;eem that the <HI>Mandarines</HI> and better &s;ort of people are more en|lightened, and confine them&s;elves to the wor&s;hip of one GOD. They do not frequent the pagodas, they have no idols, but adore the &s;upreme in their courts, with uplifted eyes. A per&s;on of the family reads the petition to heaven. <HI>Dampier</HI>'s
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 58.</NOTE> account of the ceremony is curious; "When they make this petition," &s;ays he,
<Q>they order a great deal of good meat to be dre&s;&s;ed, and calling
<PB N="80" REF="96">all their &s;ervants into the court where the ceremony is to be performed, they place the food on a table, where al&s;o two in|cen&s;e-pots are placed, and then the mandarine pre&s;ents a paper to the clerk, who reads it with an audible voice. In the fir&s;t place, there is drawn up an ample account of all that GOD has ble&s;t him withal, as health, riches, honor, favor of his prince, &amp;c. and long life, if he be old; and towards the conclu&s;ion, there is a petition to GOD for a continuance of all the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings, and a further augmentation of them; e&s;pecially with long life, and favor of his prince, which la&s;t they e&s;teem as the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings. While this paper is reading, the ma&s;ter kneels down, and bows his face to the earth, and when the clerk has done reading it, he puts it to the burning ru&s;hes, that are in the incen&s;e-pot, where it is con&s;umed; then he flings in three or four little bundles of &s;acred paper, which is very fine and gilded; and when that al&s;o is burnt, he bids his &s;ervants eat the meat.</Q></P>
<P>IT is &s;ingular that in matters relative to their oaths of allegi|ance,

<P>I WILL conclude with the extent of the kingdom of <HI>Tonquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXTENT.</NOTE> and with a brief account of the inhabitants.

<P>THE province bordering on <HI>China</HI> on the &s;ide of the bay is that of <HI>Tenan,</HI> &s;mall, but extremely fertile in rice; off the coa&s;t are multitudes of i&s;les, very properly called, by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>I&s;lands of Pirates.</HI> They are inhabited by fi&s;hermen, who make no &s;cruple of robbing every &s;hip they can ma&s;ter.

If a &s;on is incorrigible by a parent, the parent takes him before the judge, who &s;eldom fails to bring him to a &s;en&s;e of his duty. Filial re&s;pect, &s;ays <HI>Confucius,</HI> in his <HI>Auking,</HI> a book on that very &s;ubject, is the foundation of all virtue, and of the wi&s;e government of the empire.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are treated by the parents with the utmo&s;t rigor; the doctrine of obedience is inculcated with the greate&s;t &s;everity, &s;o that it becomes ever after habitual: but as this re&s;pect to|wards their &s;uperiors is attended with fear and meanne&s;s, &s;o deceit and fraud become the characteri&s;tics of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> nation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame re&s;pect to tho&s;e in a higher &s;tation pervades all ranks of people; hence the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are the mo&s;t ceremonious of man|kind, and the very lowe&s;t orders full of the mo&s;t profound arti|ficial civility.</P>
<P>THE emperor has the di&s;po&s;al of all offices, nay, even of the lives and fortunes of every &s;ubject. Nothing is done, of any moment, from one extremity to the other of this va&s;t empire, without his knowledge; in criminal ca&s;es the calendar of pri|&s;oners convict are laid before him, with a &s;tatement of their crimes; the&s;e li&s;ts are returned to the re&s;pective judges, with the &s;entence affixed to each name, be it of death or free pardon. The le&s;&s;er puni&s;hments are left to the plea&s;ure of the ma|gi&s;trate.</P>
<P>THE de&s;poti&s;m of the emperor is founded upon law and cu&s;tom;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESPOTIC.</NOTE> not expre&s;&s;ed, yet fully implied, it &s;eems admitted that
<PB N="89" REF="103">he can do no wrong! but it is on the principle that the &s;tate is a va&s;t family, that <HI>Tyen, i. e.</HI> the Supreme Being, hath placed him on the throne, in order that he may be a father and a mother to his people. In con&s;equence of this, a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of his duty is continually before his eyes. The mandarines and princes of the blood are at liberty to remind him of any faults he may fall into; and even the people, if they find him negligent, are as ready to become tumultuous as in any other country. The grand &s;ecret of government in the emperor is the unremitting attention paid to the conduct of the mandarines and other magi&s;trates, who are carefully watched, and mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed on every failure of duty. He him&s;elf is perpetually anxious to con&s;ult the good of his &s;ubjects, and to avoid incurring their hatred or contempt.</P>

<P>THE reigning vice of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> is &s;elf-intere&s;t,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIDE.</NOTE> They a&s;&s;ume an imaginary pre-eminence over all the world, and conceive nothing can be right but what they do.

<P>THIS leading feature is, be&s;ides,

<P>THE founder of their empire is &s;aid to be <HI>Fo-hi,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FO-HI, FOUNDER OF THE EMPIRE.</NOTE> cotemporary with <HI>Phaleg</HI> and <HI>Heber.</HI> His &s;ubjects at that time were nearly in the &s;tate of nature; they fed on what they caught, ate it raw, drank the blood, and clothed them&s;elves with the &s;kins.

They hold al&s;o an expiation of &s;ins by their own &s;acrifices; but confe&s;s that no external adoration will be accepted unle&s;s it is attended with inward &s;entiments, and comes directly from the heart.

<PB N="93" REF="107">had been corrupted by certain of his profligate di&s;ciples, who might think it better to peri&s;h than burn; yet as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be perpetually di&s;turbed with the thoughts of death, they pretended to have invented a liquor of immortality, which, with the credulity of &s;ome of the emperors, gave a prodigious increa&s;e to their followers; they were greatly addicted to magic, introduced wor&s;hip of &s;pirits, &s;acrificed to devils, and deluded the vulgar by a thou&s;and juggling tricks.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t was the &s;ect of <HI>Fo</HI> or <HI>Fwe</HI> (not to be confounded with the great <HI>Fo-hi.</HI>)
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT OF FO.</NOTE> Their doctrine was tran&s;ported out of <HI>India</HI> about 65 years after the birth of Chri&s;t.

The effect of this mi&s;&s;ion did not continue long; at fir&s;t they made abundance of pro&s;elytes; they were favored by the reigning emperor, permitted to build churches, and inculcate their doctrine among his &s;ubjects. This monu|ment brings down their hi&s;tory to 783, the time of its being made. In the year 845, an emperor inimical to the mona&s;tic life aro&s;e, and by an ordinance entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every religious hou&s;e. This was in fact levelled at the <HI>Bonzees,</HI> and the profe&s;&s;ors of the idolatry of <HI>Fo</HI> or <HI>Fwe,</HI> who had not only ex|pended va&s;t &s;ums in the ornaments of their pagodas and mona&s;|teries,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONVENTS.</NOTE> but made them &s;anctuaries for all kinds of profligates. This event corre&s;ponds exactly with our celebrated di&s;&s;olution: here four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred of the great mona&s;teries of male and female reclu&s;es, and forty thou&s;and of the le&s;&s;er, were directed to be demoli&s;hed, the lands and revenues to revert to the royal

From this time the hi&s;tory of the&s;e people was con&s;igned to oblivion, nor ever would have been known, but for the di&s;covery of the <HI>Si|gnan-&s;u</HI> monument.</P>
<P>THE ambition of the great Je&s;uit St.

<P>IN 1549 he &s;ailed from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> and after di&s;charging his mi&s;&s;ion in that i&s;land, determined on a vi&s;it to <HI>China.</HI> Death fru&s;trated his pious de&s;ign, but pre&s;erved him from the mortifi|cation of being refu&s;ed an entrance into the empire, according to the mo&s;t rigid ordinances then in force.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">FATHER RICCI.</NOTE> and <HI>Ricci</HI> of <HI>Macerata.</HI> The la&s;t was a man of &s;uperior abilities, who with his two brethren had rendered them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> language at <HI>Goa,</HI> before they began their mi&s;&s;ion. They entered on it in the year 1583. After &s;everal un|favorable e&s;&s;ays, <HI>Ricci</HI> found his way to the court; he had all the art and in&s;inuation of his order; a noble air, great &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and an exten&s;ive knowlege of the &s;ciences, par|ticularly of the mathematics. He came al&s;o provided with pre|&s;ents; he gave the emperor a clock, a picture of our Saviour, and another of the Virgin, each of which, &s;ay the Je&s;uits, had a mo&s;t honorable place. <HI>Pa&s;io</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> had been recalled, and the whole power was ve&s;ted in <HI>Ricci;</HI> under whom crowds of &s;ubordinate Je&s;uits preached the go&s;pel with the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. They &s;eemed to have a toleration, or at lea&s;t a connivance. They reconciled the doctrine of their great ma&s;ter, and the rites of the Chri&s;tian religion, with the ceremonies of that of <HI>China. Ricci</HI> permitted his pro&s;elytes to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the annual commemoration of the followers of <HI>Con&s;ucius,</HI> and to intermingle the rites of both churches, &s;o as to gain converts innumerable. He baptized &s;everal Mandarines and per&s;ous of rank; among others two rich
<PB N="97" REF="111">widows, one by the name of <HI>Candida,</HI> the other that of <HI>Agatha.</HI> The wealthy founded churches; and the poor filled them with their numbers.

<P>SEVERAL other Je&s;uits of great abilities &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;upported his labors; a per&s;ecution had been rai&s;ed again&s;t them, but luck|ily at the &s;ame time an inva&s;ion was threatened by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> A Mandarine, a Chri&s;tian convert, advi&s;ed the calling in the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> engineers to direct the artillery; the ad|vice was taken, and their &s;ucce&s;s again brought the Chri&s;tians into favor.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">FATHER VERBIEST.</NOTE> and father <HI>Verbie&s;t,</HI> another Je&s;uit of fir&s;t rate abilities, was engaged in the &s;ame &s;ervice. It certainly was not the &s;piritual merits of the fa|thers that gained them the patronage of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> emperors, but their knowlege of the arts. They had brethren of all pro|&s;e&s;&s;ions, painters, mechanics, turners, watch-makers, founders, accomptants, a&s;tronomers, and ma&s;ters of ordnance. <HI>Verbie&s;t,</HI> and &s;ome of the able&s;t of the fathers, were con&s;ulted about mat|ters of &s;tate; and by tho&s;e various means became a mo&s;t pow|erful mini&s;try. They were created Mandarines, and appeared at court in a rich dre&s;s of that order, with the dragon flaming on their brea&s;ts. <HI>Cam-hi</HI> even i&s;&s;ued an edict in favor of the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="98" REF="112">religion. Among the miracles of the times, an eunuch converted fifty ladies; and <HI>Helena Taming,</HI> empre&s;s of <HI>China,</HI> held epi&s;to|lary corre&s;pondence with pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VIIth.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOMINICANS.</NOTE> The <HI>Dominicans</HI> and the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> were zealous to partake of the honor, and &s;hare in the good work; but again, unluckily for both, the Je&s;uits were more of this world, their rivals of the other.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAST REVO|LUTION.</NOTE> The la&s;t revolution was effected in 1644.

<P>GUNPOWDER was invented in <HI>Europe</HI> by a monk;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GUNPOWDER.</NOTE> the fir&s;t cannon ever ca&s;t in <HI>China,</HI> were the work of a Je&s;uit, Father <HI>Adam Schaal,</HI> by order of the emperor; the next of the father <HI>Verbie&s;t,</HI> the great ornament of the order; he fir&s;t ca&s;t a hundred and thirty, and after that three hundred and twenty.

The Je&s;uits, in return, fixed on a day for ble&s;&s;ing his labors; dre&s;&s;ed in his religious habit, he nine times pro&s;trated him&s;elf, and beat his forehead again&s;t the ground.

<PB N="105" REF="119">fixed a crucifix on an altar before the train of artillery, which he baptized piece by piece, and gave to each the name of a male or female &s;aint, taken from the calendar of his own church.</P>
<P>GUNPOWDER was of very early invention in <HI>China</HI> and in <HI>India,</HI> but till the time that I have ju&s;t mentioned, it was never applied to any other u&s;es than fire-works on fe&s;tive occa&s;ions, in which the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &s;till excel all the re&s;t of the world.

<P>THE very important article of &s;ilk &s;hall next be &s;poken of.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILK.</NOTE> In my account of <HI>Spain</HI> will be given the hi&s;tory of the origin of this manufacture, and the various countries it pa&s;&s;ed through in its way from <HI>China,</HI> its native &s;eat. The care of the &s;ilk-worm was of the mo&s;t early date; it was begun by <HI>Si-ling,</HI> one of the queens of <HI>Whang-ti,</HI> third emperor from <HI>Fo-hi,</HI> at the period in which his &s;ubjects &s;till clothed them&s;elves in the undre&s;&s;ed &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts; how &s;urpri&s;ing was the change for the luxurious habit of &s;ilk. Succeeding empre&s;&s;es followed her example; they went attended by their fair &s;uite to the orchard of mulberry trees, gathered the leaves of three trees, either with their own hands, or by the hands of the ladies under their in&s;pection. A piece of the fine&s;t &s;ilk was woven and devoted to the ceremony of the &s;acrifice to the <HI>Shang-Ti,</HI> or the Supreme Being. More policy than religion is intermixed with this &s;acrifice; the wi&s;e <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> knew that they could not inforce too &s;trongly the cultivation of a tree which feeds the great &s;taple of the empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have two trees which contribute to this purpo&s;e;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MULBERRY TREES.</NOTE> the one is the <HI>Sang</HI> or <HI>Te-&s;ang,</HI> the <HI>Morus Alba</HI> or white mul|berry tree, &s;o well known in the &s;outh of <HI>Europe;</HI> this is culti|vated
<PB N="107" REF="121">in plantations. The other kind is the <HI>Che,</HI> or <HI>Ye-&s;ang,</HI> the wild mulberry, which grows on the hills in fore&s;ts, has &s;mall roundi&s;h rough leaves &s;calloped on the edges, and termi|nating in a point; the branches thorny; the fruit like pepper; in a few words a tree of a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, if not genus, from the former. On the&s;e trees, the young of the &s;ilkworms which are hatched, are laid. The &s;ilk, produced from them, is &s;aid to be &s;tronger and earlier than from tho&s;e bred on the common mul|berry. Paths are cut among the fore&s;ts of the <HI>Che,</HI> the ground is cleared of weeds which may give &s;helter to &s;erpents that devour the worms; and per&s;ons watch with guns to de&s;troy the birds that make them their food; the&s;e trees are al&s;o cultivated in &s;ome places like the white mulberry.</P>
<P>I SHALL make mention of a &s;pecies of &s;ilk totally different in its origin from the preceding; this is de&s;cribed by <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. 354.</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILK OF PLINY.</NOTE> who &s;ays it is made by certain worms in the province of <HI>Shang|tong.</HI> It is not fabricated by them into <HI>Cocons,</HI> but left adhering to &s;mall trees or &s;hrubs in form of very long threads, which are gathered and woven into a coar&s;e &s;ilk, called <HI>Kien chew,</HI> a very thick, la&s;ting &s;ort, which wa&s;hes well, and is in much e&s;teem with the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THIS account certainly vindicates the opinion held by the ancients that &s;ilk was an article combed from the leaves of cer|tain trees. <HI>"Primi &s;unt hominum"</HI> &s;ays <HI>Pliny</HI> (&s;peaking of the <HI>Scytharum Gen.</HI> lib. vi. c. xvii.)

The manufactory even in the ribband or haberda&s;hery way did not reach our kingdom till about the year 1482. <HI>Spain</HI> had very long the &s;tart of us.

The royal re&s;idence during &s;ummer at that time was <HI>Kambalu</HI> or rather <HI>Hampalu, i. e.</HI> the &s;eat of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> the &s;ame with the modern <HI>Pe-king;</HI> but the capital of the empire was the pre&s;ent <HI>Nanquin. Kublay-Khan</HI> made u&s;e of <HI>Marco</HI> on &s;everal important emba&s;&s;ies and weighty affairs. The father and brother continued with the court; and in their commercial capacities contributed to its &s;plendor by procuring jewels, and all the materials of luxury. <HI>Marco,</HI> his father, and uncle remained with the <HI>Khan</HI> a great number of years, and re|turned &s;afe to <HI>Venice</HI> in 1295, enriched by their profe&s;&s;ion, and in the highe&s;t e&s;teem with their countrymen.</P>
<P><HI>Marco</HI> wrote his travels, which have been publi&s;hed in mo&s;t languages; he was a diligent and faithful ob&s;erver. I mu&s;t refer to <HI>Bergeron,</HI> to <HI>Purchas,</HI> but particularly to <HI>John Reinhold
<PB N="112" REF="126">For&s;ter,</HI> for the detail of his travels. He gives a mo&s;t &s;plendid account of the court of his ma&s;ter, and &s;hews the &s;tate of the polite arts in <HI>China</HI> in tho&s;e early days; mentions the u&s;e of the &s;ilk-worm, the knowlege of the making of paper from the <HI>Morus Papyri&s;era;</HI> the di&s;tillation of brandy from the milk of mares, and numbers of other curious circum&s;tances beyond the limits of my plan. <HI>Marco</HI> was al&s;o attentive to the natural hi&s;tory of the country; mentions coals, which he calls black combu&s;tible &s;tones; de&s;cribes &s;ome &s;orts of falcons and cranes; the <HI>Argus</HI> phea&s;ant, or phea&s;ants with tails thirty inches long, and in particular &s;peaks about the number of partridges and quails. He takes notice of the <HI>Mu&s;k</HI> animal, <HI>Hi&s;t. Quad.</HI> i. N^o 65. The <HI>Thibet</HI> cows with long &s;ilky tails, N^o 8. The <HI>Argali,</HI> N^o 13, or wild &s;heep with enormous horns; and &s;everal other matters, both natural and oeconomical, which have &s;ince been confirmed by more modern travellers.</P>
<P>I SHALL now &s;peak of the celebrated Sir <HI>John Mandeville.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE.</NOTE> Sir John was born at St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and became the greate&s;t traveller of his or any other age, having been out thirty-four years, and in the character of pilgrim, knight-errant, and man of ob&s;erva|tion, vi&s;ited the greate&s;t part of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> then known. It is probable that he penetrated as far as <HI>China.</HI> He left an account of his travels, which were &s;hamefully fal&s;ified by the monks, who de&s;troyed much of their credit, by mingling with them legendary tales, and &s;tories out of <HI>Pliny;</HI> but &s;till truth appears &s;o frequently, that the authenticity of the ground work is by no means impaired. He was called <HI>Johannes de Mandevile</HI> aliter dictus ad <HI>Barbam,</HI> from his forked beard; he found a grave at
<PB N="113" REF="127"><HI>Liege,</HI> in the convent of the Gulielmites in 1371. He is engraven on his tomb, armed, and treading on a lion. At his head, the hand of one ble&s;&s;ing him; and the&s;e words in the <HI>French</HI> of the time,
<Q><HI>Vos ki pa&s;eis &s;or mi pour l'amour Deix proies por mi.</HI></Q> His knives, hor&s;e furniture, and &s;purs, were, in the time of <HI>Ortelius,</HI> pre&s;erved at <HI>Liege</HI> by the monks, and &s;hewn to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>THE intercour&s;e which the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had by their caravans with this part of the ea&s;tern world, will be given in a future volume.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUSSIANS.</NOTE> I &s;hall not therefore introduce it here, but proceed to the fir&s;t di&s;|covery of <HI>China</HI> by &s;ea, by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> in the bu&s;y &s;ixteenth century. In the year 1515 <HI>Alvarenga,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> viceroy of the <HI>Indies,</HI> turned his thoughts towards a &s;ettlement in <HI>China;</HI> and be&s;towed on <HI>Ferdinand Pedro Andrada,</HI> an able officer, the conduct of the expedition. In <HI>June</HI> 1517 he &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Ma|lacca,</HI> with three &s;hips, and arrived at the i&s;land of <HI>Tamanlabua,</HI> four leagues from the main land of <HI>China.</HI> At that time the coa&s;t was infe&s;ted with pirates; and fortunately <HI>Andrada</HI> fell in, &s;ays <HI>O&s;orio</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 244.</NOTE>, with the imperial fleet, who on &s;ight of him (think|ing him a pirate) prepared for battle; but how great was their &s;urprize when they found that he gave no &s;ign of ho&s;tile inten|tion, but &s;ailed peaceably with them till they anchored off the i&s;le of <HI>Tama.</HI> I believe this to be the &s;ame which Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voy. p. 36.</NOTE> calls <HI>Heytamon,</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly that on which <HI>Macao</HI> was built. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> admiral there &s;ent to enquire who the&s;e &s;trange people were, and received &s;uch an an&s;wer as quite gained his confidence. <HI>Andrada</HI> then &s;ailed with them for the port of
<PB N="114" REF="128"><HI>Nanto,</HI> a fine city and harbor about &s;ixty miles from <HI>Canton;</HI> there he met with the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable reception, and by his prudent conduct quite conciliated the affection of the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> He landed there the emba&s;&s;ador <HI>(Thomas Perez)</HI> who was im|mediately conducted to the imperial court. <HI>Andrada</HI> returned to the i&s;le of <HI>Tama,</HI> informed him&s;elf of every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary, and greatly enriched him&s;elf and companions by his commerce with the merchants, who flocked to him from diffe|rent countries. He left <HI>China</HI> after impre&s;&s;ing on the nation the highe&s;t opinion of the integrity of his countrymen.</P>
<P>ALL this was ruined by the ill conduct of <HI>Simon</HI> his brother, who &s;oon after arrived there to form the &s;ettlement. After building a fort he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure, and began to offer in&s;ults and violence of every kind to the natives, who fell on the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> killed numbers, and obliged <HI>Simon</HI> to &s;ecure him&s;elf by flight.</P>
<P>THE emperor di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the emba&s;&s;ador, who on his arrival at <HI>Canton,</HI> was flung into pri&s;on by the citizens, where he peri&s;hed mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> for a long time were the dete&s;tation of the <HI>Chine&s;e;</HI> towards the clo&s;e of the century they regained their affection by a piece of &s;ervice they had an opportunity of doing to the empire by relieving it from the in&s;ult of the pirate <HI>Chang|&s;i-Lau,</HI> who had &s;eized on the i&s;land of <HI>Macao,</HI> and was be&s;ieging <HI>Canton.</HI> The emperor pre&s;ented the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> with <HI>Macao,</HI> as a reward, who fortified it with two hundred pieces of cannon, at which the &s;ubtle <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> took no &s;ort of umbrage; for they had &s;tationed their forces in &s;uch a manner, as to cut them off
<PB N="115" REF="129">(at will) from even their daily provi&s;ion. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;till re|tain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, and have a governor of their own; but a Mandarine re&s;ides here who is &s;upreme over the whole i&s;land, &s;o that they are in a very dependant &s;tate; and they be|&s;ides pay an annual tribute, on the original agreement of being permitted to erect fortifications. They enjoy their own laws and religion, and have a bi&s;hop of <HI>Macao,</HI> &s;uffragan to the arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came in late for their &s;hare of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> trade.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH,</NOTE> In 1584 we made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to get there, but ar|rived no farther than the <HI>Brazils;</HI> our thoughts at that period were full of the rich <HI>Cathaian</HI> coa&s;t; and all <HI>Europe</HI> was engaged in many an attempt for the di&s;covery of the pa&s;&s;age to it, but,

<P>OUR fir&s;t factory in that empire was about the year 1701,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST AT CHUSAN.</NOTE> when the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> granted to us <HI>Chu&s;an,</HI> a &s;mall i&s;land not far from the coa&s;t of <HI>Tche-Tchiang,</HI> in Lat. 30&deg; 40&prime;. It had been totally depopulated by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but began to be re-peopled when we &s;ettled there. The be&s;t account given of the place is by Mr. <HI>J. Cunningham,</HI> a very ingenious &s;urgeon who attended our colony; he &s;ays
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ph. Tran&s;. Abr. vol. v. p. 171.</NOTE> it abounded with provi&s;ions of all kind, and with cows, buffaloes, deer, goats, and wild hogs, and many kinds of e&s;culent plants; and with the tea &s;hrub on the tops of the hills. The <HI>Kiew-yeu, Croton Sebiferum</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Emb. to China, vol. ii. p. 430. E.</NOTE>, or tallow tree, is com|mon
<PB N="116" REF="130">here, and many other parts of <HI>China;</HI> and grows as high as a tall cherry tree; the fruit opens like a che&s;nut, and contains kernels enveloped with a pulp, which has all the properties of tallow; excellent candles, void of any &s;mell, are made of it when melted; it al&s;o &s;upplies the lamps with oil; <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 319.</NOTE> gives us the proce&s;s. He al&s;o de&s;cribes a tree, called <HI>Pe-la-&s;hu,</HI> which pro|duces wax; a kind of little worm fa&s;tens on its leaves, where|with being covered, in a &s;hort time they form combs of wax, much &s;maller than the honey combs; this wax is very hard and &s;hining, and con&s;iderably dearer than bees-wax. When the&s;e worms are accu&s;tomed to the trees of any di&s;trict, they never quit them, but on particular occa&s;ions; if once they re|move from a place they never return, &s;o that others mu&s;t be pro|cured in their &s;tead, there being merchants who deal in them.</P>
<P>I cannot a&s;certain the <HI>Genus</HI> or &s;pecies of this tree. There is a <HI>Myrica cerifera</HI> in <HI>North America</HI> that affords a very good wax, <HI>Cate&s;by</HI> i. tab. 69; and another at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope, Journal Hi&s;torique,</HI> &amp;c. p. 88. tab. oppo&s;ite to the page; <HI>Spar|man</HI> i. p. 346. <HI>Myrica Aethiopica Lin.</HI> Mr. <HI>Sparman</HI> &s;ays, that the berries are covered at a certain time of the year with a greeni&s;h, wax-like and tallowy &s;ub&s;tance, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the effect of in&s;ects: of this the natives make candles. I &s;hould think it the &s;ame with the &s;pecies ju&s;t de&s;cribed; but, that <HI>Du Halde</HI> &s;ays, the in&s;ects in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> plants depo&s;it their wax on the leaves. In the <HI>Aethiopica</HI> it is found on what <HI>Lin|naeus</HI> calls cones.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Cunningham</HI> al&s;o mentions the <HI>Syringa Arabica</HI> of <HI>Ge|rard,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="131">p. 1400; or the <HI>Nyctanthes &s;ambac</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus.</HI>

The great wall (hereafter to be men|tioned) &s;ecures the parts unprotected by nature. The coa&s;t is u&s;ually rude and rocky, and the interior often ri&s;es into craggy picture&s;que mountains, or is inter&s;ected by numerous rivers and canals. The &s;eas are &s;hallow, &s;o that even from a naval attack the country has its protection.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING part of <HI>China</HI> is within the tropics, and the great remainder does not exceed Lat. 43 north, yet the cold is, during winter, inten&s;e. There is no country in which exi&s;ts &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity for furs; their own empire, <HI>Tartary,</HI> and <HI>Siberia</HI> is almo&s;t exhau&s;ted for the &s;upply; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> even furni&s;h them with quantities from <HI>North America.</HI> Ice has been &s;een at <HI>Canton</HI> an inch in thickne&s;s.

Mr. <HI>Kirwan</HI> &s;ays, that the greate&s;t cold at <HI>Peking</HI> (in Lat. 39&deg; 55&prime;) is 5&deg;, the greate&s;t heat 98; yet on <HI>July</HI> 25th, 1773, the thermometer ro&s;e to 108 and 110. The extreme&s;t cold is produced by a north-ea&s;t or north-we&s;t wind; the la&s;t blows over the va&s;t tract of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Siberia.</HI> In <HI>Peking,</HI> during winter, the animals and fowls of all kinds are expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the markets, frozen, and &s;o pre&s;erved from putrefaction for weeks together.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="138">THE interior of <HI>China</HI> maintains a mo&s;t &s;ingular character; it is varied with chains of mountains winding along its &s;urface, yet &s;o as to leave vallies that enabled one of the emperors to open a communication by water, partly by means of rivers and partly by navigable canals, from <HI>Peking</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> a di&s;tance of 1500 miles: little interruption occurs in this va&s;t &s;pace, except the lofty mountains which &s;eparate the provinces of <HI>Kiang-&s;ee</HI> and <HI>Quan-Tung.</HI> We &s;hall &s;peak farther of this, and the other canals, in their proper places.</P>
<P>I SHALL now enter on the topographical account,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF HAI|NAN.</NOTE> commencing at its &s;outhern extremity. The i&s;land of <HI>Hainan, i. e.</HI> the &s;outh of the &s;ea, expre&s;&s;es its &s;ituation. It belongs to the province of <HI>Quang-tung</HI> (which, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Hai-nan,</HI> juts far &s;outh in a penin&s;ulated form) and is di&s;tant above twelve miles from the &s;hore; is a hundred and &s;ixty leagues in circumference, and produces every thing that can conduce to the wants and conve|niences of life; the climate alone is bad, by rea&s;on of the quality of the water.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> The i&s;land abounds with gold; but as it has been but half conquered, that valuable metal is in the power of the natives, a brave, independent people, who live in the middle parts, amid&s;t arduous mountains; the re&s;t of the country being a plain. The inhabitants had long a traffic with the <HI>Chine&s;e;</HI> one was deputed to examine the goods offered; and on the other part a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> merchant went to &s;ee tho&s;e of the mountaineers: the utmo&s;t honor was ob&s;erved on both &s;ides. The <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> e&s;pe|cially the governor, made immen&s;e profit of the gold. This the great <HI>Kang-hi</HI> di&s;covered, and put a final &s;top to a commerce which till then had been allowed by law. The <HI>Lapis Armenus,</HI> which produces blue &s;o much in reque&s;t for coloring the porce|lane,
<PB N="125" REF="139">is al&s;o found here, and much of it &s;ent to <HI>Canton</HI> for that purpo&s;e. The fi&s;heries are very lucrative, twenty or thirty thou|&s;and jonks, of no incon&s;iderable &s;ize, come annually from <HI>Canton</HI> to take in cargoes of the dried or &s;alted fi&s;h. Our company's &s;hips now and then put in here, and may be &s;ecure during the mon|&s;oons.</P>
<P>THE continent, after attaining the bottom of the penin&s;ula, trends towards the north-ea&s;t, and is all the way &s;kirted with i&s;les. Tho&s;e be&s;t known to mariners are the two <HI>Sanciams,</HI> the <HI>Fal&s;e,</HI> and that called <HI>Saint John</HI>'s, beneath which is good an|chorage. The great <HI>Ladrone</HI> and the <HI>A&s;&s;es Ears</HI> are noted land marks. The entrance of the va&s;t bay of <HI>Canton</HI> opens to the ea&s;t of <HI>Sanciam;</HI> the breadth there is about two and twenty leagues, and the depth nearly the &s;ame; but filled with i&s;lands divided by mo&s;t narrow and intricate channels; po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e might be the <HI>gates</HI> of <HI>China</HI> mentioned by the two <HI>Maho|metan</HI> travellers of the ninth century, as <HI>Canton</HI> was their <HI>Canfu,</HI> even at that time a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city. It was al&s;o the <HI>Ca|nectum</HI> of the <HI>Nubian</HI> geographer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Sanciam</HI> is famed for having been the place of interment of <HI>Saint Francis de Xavier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF SAN|CIAM.</NOTE> and for his tomb, which &s;till is to be &s;een. Another i&s;le is that of <HI>Hoan-pou,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch</HI> had built a fort in order to command the navigation of the <HI>Tigris,</HI> or river of <HI>Canton.</HI> Their de&s;ign was di&s;covered, and they were all ma&s;&s;acred.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t important city is that of <HI>Macao,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MACAO.</NOTE> &s;eated on a little penin&s;ula, and which was, during a certain period, celebrated
<PB N="126" REF="140">for its wealth and commerce; it is now quite declined from its former &s;plendor, but is well known to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> as the place where their &s;hips commonly anchor in their way inward, and from being the re&s;idence of all the <HI>European</HI> factories, who are obliged by the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> to quit <HI>Canton</HI> as &s;oon as the &s;hips have left the river.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TYPA.</NOTE> About &s;ix miles lower is the <HI>Typa,</HI> a harbor for careening of &s;hips. Here Commodore <HI>An&s;on</HI> heaved down the <HI>Centurion</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 1743, previous to the capture of the <HI>Manilla</HI> &s;hip on <HI>June</HI> 20th, old &s;tile, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the great fortunes of that lucky hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Hu-men,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOCCA TIGRIS.</NOTE> or <HI>Tigers-gate,</HI> or the <HI>Bocca-tigris</HI> of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> is the narrow pa&s;s into that river, which is not a mu&s;ket|&s;hot over, and defended by two mi&s;erable batteries. Mr. <HI>An&s;on</HI> pa&s;&s;ed them in his way to the <HI>Canton</HI> river. The poor pilot, who reluctantly carried him through, and the mandarine who com|manded the forts, were mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed for what they could not po&s;&s;ibly help; the commodore having threatened to hang the pilot in ca&s;e of non-compliance. The poor mandarine knew his own weakne&s;s. The real mouth of the river is &s;ome miles below the <HI>Bocca,</HI> and has on one &s;ide the <HI>Lion</HI>'s tower, or pagoda. The river takes from thence a grand curvature towards the we&s;t. The anchoring place for the <HI>European</HI> &s;hips is under the i&s;le of <HI>Wampoo,</HI> a few miles to the ea&s;t of <HI>Canton.</HI> The approach into the bay, and the amazing view along the river, is &s;o graphically de&s;cribed by my fa|vorite M. <HI>Le Poivre,</HI> that I cannot re&s;i&s;t u&s;ing the words of that enchanting author.
<Q>On the appearance of land (&s;ays he) I perceived along the horizon a fore&s;t of ma&s;ts, and &s;oon
<PB N="127" REF="141">after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the &s;urface of the water: the&s;e were thou&s;ands of fi&s;hermen, who&s;e indu&s;try drew from the deeps &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for numbers. The land now began to ri&s;e to my view. I advanced to the mouth of the river, &s;till amid&s;t crowds of fi&s;hers, throwing out their lines on every &s;ide. I entered the river of <HI>Kanton;</HI> it is people like the land; its banks lined with &s;hips at an|chor; a prodigious number of &s;mall craft are continually gliding along in every direction, &s;ome with &s;ails, others with oars, vani&s;hing often &s;uddenly from the &s;ight, as they enter the numberle&s;s canals, dug with amazing labour acro&s;s ex|ten&s;ive plains, which they water and fertilize. Immen&s;e fields, covered with all the glory of the harve&s;t, with &s;tately villages ri&s;ing to the eye on every &s;ide, adorn the remoter view, whil&s;t mountains, covered with verdure, cut into terraces, and &s;haped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this noble land|&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> divide their cities into fir&s;t rate, &s;econd, and third.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANTON.</NOTE> The fir&s;t may be known by the addition of <HI>foo,</HI> the &s;econd by that of <HI>tchoo,</HI> the third by that of <HI>hyen. Quang-tchoo-foo,</HI> or <HI>Canton,</HI> is chief among the fir&s;t, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a mil|lion of inhabitants. <HI>Fachan,</HI> a village a few miles higher, has the &s;ame number. This in &s;ome mea&s;ure inclines us to think that <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s calculation is not very far out of the way.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERY POPULOUS.</NOTE> The land, and the very water is inhabited. Millions live in the <HI>Sam|panes,</HI> or ve&s;&s;els, placed on each &s;ide of the great rivers. Tho&s;e of <HI>Canton</HI> alone may contain two hundred and twenty|five thou&s;and inmates. Thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands dwell on the
<PB N="128" REF="142">exalted rocks; &s;ome are excavated into man&s;ions, and every ledge has on its its elegant cottage; &s;warms of people inhabit the edges of precipices, as the myriads of birds do the great promon|tories of <HI>Britain.</HI> Paths are cut through the rocks to render them acce&s;&s;ible, and over &s;ome are conducted even public roads. I have &s;een &s;everal of the&s;e populated rocks mo&s;t accurately repre&s;ented in rice, with all the oeconomy of their inhabitants expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE city is divided into three; the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and a third beyond the fir&s;t, which is repre&s;ented on the plan as a void &s;pace. The &s;treets are narrow, but well paved; and cro&s;s each other at right angles. The whole is &s;urrounded with a wall; and each city &s;eparated from the other by another wall. The gates of <HI>Canton</HI> are &s;hut in the evening, as are the barriers at the end of every &s;treet, &s;o that the greate&s;t cities are as quiet as a private family.</P>
<P>TRIUMPHAL arches are very frequent in mo&s;t of the cities;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRIUMPHAL ARCHES.</NOTE> the ancient are the mo&s;t elegant, adorned with beautiful figures of men, birds, and flowers in alt-relief, quite &s;tanding from the &s;tone, and connected only by cordons left for the purpo&s;e. The&s;e monuments are probably honorary memorials of the great ac|tions of individuals.</P>
<P>IN front, on each &s;ide of the city, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the river,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EUROPEAN FACTORIES</NOTE> are large &s;uburbs. The factories of the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> merchants con&s;i&s;t of a long row of hou&s;es, ranged on the river &s;ide, and a &s;pace of land behind, about two hundred yards broad; each has a warehou&s;e for its goods.

<Q>by artificial heat; the eggs being laid in boxes of &s;and, are placed on a brick hearth, to which is given a proper heat during the

The ducklings are fed with little craw-fi&s;hes and crabs, boiled and cut &s;mall, and afterwards mixed with boiled rice, and in about a fortnight &s;hift for them&s;elves, when the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> provide them an old &s;tep-mother, who leads them where they are to find provender for them|&s;elves, being fir&s;t put on board a <HI>Sampane,</HI> or boat, which is de&s;tined for their habitation, and from which the whole flock, often to the amount of three or four hundred, go out to feed, and return at command. This method is u&s;ed nine months out of the twelve (for in the colder months it does not &s;uc|ceed) and is &s;o far from a novelty, that it may be every where &s;een; but more e&s;pecially about the time of cutting the rice and gleaning the crop, when the ma&s;ters of the duck <HI>Sampanes</HI> row up and down the river, according to the oppor|tunity of procuring food, which is found in plenty at the tide of ebb on the rice plantations, as they are overflowed at high water. It is curious to &s;ee how the ducks obey their ma&s;ter; for &s;ome thou&s;ands, belonging to different boats, will feed at large on the &s;ame &s;pot, and on a &s;ignal given will follow their leader to their re&s;pective <HI>Sampanes,</HI> without a &s;tranger being found among them.

<Q>when the &s;un ri&s;es one may &s;ee on the rivers a con&s;iderable number of boats, and &s;everal of the&s;e birds &s;itting at the head of them. Then the fi&s;hermen turning their boats about, at the &s;ignal given by &s;triking the water with an oar, the cormorants fly into the river, one here, another there, and diving to the bottom, &s;eize the fi&s;h they light on by the middle; then ri&s;ing up again, they carry it to the bark, where the fi&s;herman receiving it, takes the bird, and holding its head downwards, pa&s;&s;es his hand along the neck to make it di&s;gorge the &s;mall fi&s;h that it had &s;wallowed, but is hindred from going into the gullet by a ring put on the lower part of the neck; which after the fi&s;hing is quite over, they take off and give them &s;omething to eat. When the fi&s;h happens to be too large for one bird, they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; one takes the tail, another the head, and bring it to the boat to their ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>THE other way of taking fi&s;h is very &s;imple, and gives but little trouble; for this purpo&s;e they make u&s;e of long narrow
<PB N="133" REF="147">boats, nailing on each &s;ide from one end to the other, a plank two feet broad. This plank is japanned with white &s;hining varni&s;h, and &s;lants gently till it almo&s;t touches the top of the water; in the night time, when it is u&s;ed, they turn it towards the moon, that the reflection may increa&s;e its &s;plendor, &s;o that the fi&s;h which are &s;porting, ea&s;ily mi&s;taking the color of the japanned plank for that of the water, leap often on that &s;ide, and fall either on the plank or into the boat.</P>

<P>THE great city of <HI>Nanking</HI> or <HI>Nanquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NANQUIN.</NOTE> in Lat. 32&deg; 4&prime; 30&Prime;, is &s;eated on an exten&s;ive plain, near a league from the river, but united to it by &s;everal canals, capable of bringing up the im|perial barks, which are as large as middle &s;ized &s;hips. This city was once the capital of <HI>China,</HI> till it was removed to <HI>Peking.</HI> It was the <HI>Chambdan</HI> of the <HI>Nubian</HI> geographer, on a river of the &s;ame name, which he &s;ays
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 69.</NOTE> was the large&s;t in <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of this city in 1127, and before they de&s;erted it, burnt the magnificent imperial palace, demo|li&s;hed the famous ob&s;ervatory, and violated and de&s;troyed the &s;e|pulchres of the emperors and other di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onages. The city is reported to be ninety miles in circumference; later
<PB N="141" REF="155">&s;urveys have made it only eighteen, but it certainly had been of far greater extent; much is now a wa&s;te, and retains all the marks of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> fury, but enough is inhabited to make it a mo&s;t populous and flouri&s;hing city. Of the parts which e&s;caped the rage of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> ravages, is the <HI>Porcelain tower,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORCELAIN TOWER.</NOTE> a pagoda of nine &s;tages, of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, and lined with beautiful tiles of <HI>Porcelain,</HI> from which it derives its name. It is far the mo&s;t beautiful in <HI>China.</HI> Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> gives a fine view of this curious &s;tructure, as he does of one of the modern &s;treets, the &s;igns, and manner of building; the walls of the city, &s;ome of the gates, and idol temples, evince its former grandeur; it is be&s;ides the &s;eat of the literati, and con&s;equently abounds with fine li|braries, and is eminent for its book&s;ellers &s;hops, paper, ink, and all that can feed the <HI>Cacoethes &s;cribendi.</HI> It is not without other manufactures; its fattins are in high reque&s;t, as are the woollen cloths fabricated here.</P>
<P><HI>Nanquin</HI> is garri&s;oned partly by <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> partly by <HI>Tartars;</HI> the la&s;t commanded by one of their country; they po&s;&s;e&s;s one part of the city, and are &s;eparated from the other inhabitants by a &s;ingle wall.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 1660, the famous <HI>Cor&s;air Coxinga</HI> came up the river with three thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hips, and laid &s;iege to the place. It happened that on his birth day, his army pa&s;t the day with carou&s;als, and all &s;orts of fe&s;tivity. The garri&s;on, gue&s;&s;ing that they &s;hould find the enemy buried in &s;leep, &s;allied out, &s;urpri&s;ed the camp, &s;lew multitudes, and forced the re&s;t to find &s;ecurity in their &s;hips. <HI>Coxinga</HI> afterwards fought and defeated the <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> fleet, and by his cruelty in cutting off the no&s;es of four thou&s;and pri&s;oners, &s;ullied his victory.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="156">THE pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Kyang</HI> from <HI>Nanquin,</HI> was in the time of <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> on a bridge compo&s;ed of fourteen pontoons. The pretty town of <HI>Jejenjeen</HI> is on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">YANG-CHOO.</NOTE> He entered &s;oon after on the imperial canal, and pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Yang-choo,</HI> a great and populous city, in Lat. 32&deg; 25&prime;, flouri&s;hing by its being the &s;taple of the &s;alt trade; that u&s;eful article, made on the &s;ea-&s;hores, is brought here by the le&s;&s;er canals, and by the &s;ame means tran&s;ported to mo&s;t parts of the empire; for they extend in many directions we&s;tward, even to the borders of <HI>Tartary.</HI> The canal is continued northward on the &s;ide of the great lake <HI>Kao|yeou-hoo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR VESSELS.</NOTE> the &s;ame which Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> calls <HI>Piexe.</HI> Here the forms of the ve&s;&s;els are very &s;ingular; they are called <HI>Long&s;chon</HI> or &s;erpentine, and are u&s;ed to carry fi&s;h, quite to <HI>Peking.</HI> The&s;e are repre&s;ented in form of a &s;erpent; from the prow i&s;&s;ues the head, on which is placed an idol, with &s;ome live ducks pendent; from the &s;tern is &s;u&s;pended a boy, who is playing all &s;orts of monkey tricks. The ma&s;ts are decorated with numbers of flags, and &s;erpents appear cut or painted in every part. It is manned with rowers, who with their broad oars, not unlike paddles, go with mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing celerity. It is incredible with what expe|dition fi&s;h are conveyed fre&s;h to <HI>Peking,</HI> even from di&s;tances of &s;ix hundred miles.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Yang-choo</HI> is infamous for its traffic in women.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE IN WOMEN.</NOTE> It produces the mo&s;t beautiful in all <HI>China,</HI> particularly for the admirable &s;mallne&s;s of their feet, and the &s;ymmetry of their bodies.

<P>I SHALL not attempt the de&s;cription of this magnificent city, but will content my&s;elf with &s;peaking to the eyes by the plates of Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI> which I believe repre&s;ent with great fidelity the various cities, pagodas, and other buildings he pa&s;&s;ed by; in the&s;e may be &s;een the different forms of hou&s;es, and public edifices. The &s;plendor of the emperor's palace, and a general view of the city, are &s;hewn in the 158th page. The pagodas,
<PB N="147" REF="161">the idols, in various other pages, and the cu&s;toms and dre&s;&s;es of the inhabitants are mo&s;t frequently exhibited.

<P>I NOW return to the latitude of <HI>Canton,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COASTS OF CHINA.</NOTE> and pur&s;ue the to|pography of the coa&s;ts. By rea&s;on of the great rigor with which the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> exerci&s;e their prohibition of trading in any of their ports except <HI>Canton,</HI> our knowledge of the &s;hores or harbors is very confined. We &s;hall have very little to &s;ay of an extent of between two and three thou&s;and miles of coa&s;t, following the bending of the outline; the whole of which appears &s;trangely rugged, with promontories, divided by bays, harbors, and creeks.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ladrone</HI> i&s;les,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LADRONE ISLES.</NOTE> and tho&s;e of <HI>Lema</HI> before the bay of <HI>Can|ton,</HI> are lofty, rude, and broken; that of the <HI>A&s;&s;es ears</HI> takes its name from two hills that a&s;&s;ume the form. <HI>Piedra Biancas,</HI> far|ther to the north, is a very high rock of a white color; both the la&s;t are marks to navigators.</P>
<P><HI>Foo-tchien,</HI> the province adjoining to <HI>Quang-tung</HI> on the north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOO-TCHIEN.</NOTE> is a mountanous country, but the mountains, by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, are formed into amphitheatres, with terraces, which often extend &s;everal miles in length, and a &s;eries of twenty or thirty, one above the other. The account given by <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. 273.</NOTE> is &s;o curious as to merit the attention of our readers. The&s;e are planted with rice, which is nouri&s;hed by water forced
<PB N="148" REF="162">up to a great height, and conveyed to the different plantations in pipes of bamboo. This province is remarkable for its va&s;t com|merce, opulence, and population, and al&s;o for its amazing fertility.</P>
<P>AMONG the vegetable productions,

This kind is candied, and &s;ent to all parts of the empire; another is of a deep red; and a third very &s;mall. <HI>China</HI> is the native place of oranges, from whence they were communicated to the we&s;tern world.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Li-chi</HI> and <HI>Long-ywen</HI> are fruits peculiar to the more &s;outhern parts of this empire,

The i&s;land is flat and mora&s;&s;y, and garri&s;oned by about &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men. Before the prohibitory edict it was much frequented by <HI>European</HI> &s;hips. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> about the year 1645, made a treacherous attempt on the place; they came with five &s;hips, and landed about three hundred men, who entered the town; the greater part of the inhabitants fled, but cunningly left in their hou&s;es abundance of &s;pirituous liquors; this proved the bait they intended. The <HI>Dutch</HI> intoxicated them&s;elves to a great degree; of this the fugitive citizens had notice; they re|turned, &s;urpri&s;ed the invaders in their &s;leep, and put them all to the &s;word.

This was not imme|diately productive of any con&s;equences, nor did his countrymen profit of the di&s;covery before the la&s;t century, when, in the reign of the emperor <HI>Kang-Hi,</HI> it was invaded by the famous <HI>Coxinga,</HI> who conquered at la&s;t the we&s;tern part, not for the empire of <HI>China,</HI> but for him&s;elf. At that time the kings of <HI>Quang-tung</HI> and <HI>Foo-tchien</HI> had revolted from the empire. As &s;oon as their rebellion was quelled, <HI>Kang-hi,</HI> in 1683, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of as much of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> as the young de&s;cendant of <HI>Coxinga</HI> had power to yield.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> &s;eized on this i&s;land about the year 1620. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> in their way from <HI>Japan,</HI> about the year 1633 made here a &s;ettlement. The manner of obtaining it, and their future

<P>THE coa&s;ts of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> are rude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT OF TA-WAN.</NOTE> lofty, and rocky. The prin|cipal port is that of <HI>Ta-wan,</HI> the &s;ame with that which the <HI>Dutch</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. Near it is the capital city of the &s;ame name; unfortified, but garri&s;oned by ten thou&s;and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and very populous, to which the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who are a commercial people, carry on a prodigious trade. There are be&s;ides three other cities and &s;everal villages, all inhabited by <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> The whole is remark|ably fertile, productive of grain, and all the fruits which the cor|re&s;pondent parts of <HI>China</HI> afford. As the whole of the i&s;land was inhabited by a barbarous people, dome&s;tic animals are in &s;ome degree &s;carce. Oxen are in u&s;e for riding in&s;tead of hor&s;es; &s;tags abound; and among the wild animals, monkies; but it does not appear that tygers or bea&s;ts of prey are known in any part of <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>THE i&s;land is divided from north to &s;outh by chains of lofty and inacce&s;&s;ible mountains.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF FORMOSA.</NOTE> The greater part of the we&s;tern &s;ide is inhabited by <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> the natives have the ea&s;tern entirely to them&s;elves; tho&s;e which continue on the we&s;tern are not better than &s;ervants to the coloni&s;ts, except the inhabitants of three out of the twelve di&s;tricts formed by the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> which have revolted.

<P>THEIR morals have been much mi&s;repre&s;ented by the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and the Je&s;uits. They have no external wor&s;hip, but a &s;trong notion of a Supreme Being, which renders them a quiet, hone&s;t, and benevolent race.

They were received by the natives in the mo&s;t humane manner, invited on &s;hore, and furni&s;hed with every nece&s;&s;ary. In this vi&s;it the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> ob&s;erved in the poor cottages a few ingots of gold left negligently, as if of no value.

<P>IT mu&s;t not be forgotten,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF PSALMANA|ZAR.</NOTE> that the hi&s;tory of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> was written by a per&s;on who pretended to be a <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> converted to chri&s;tianity, and to have fled from his country to avoid the dreadful puni&s;hment inflicted by the emperor on all pro&s;elytes. He a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>P&s;almanazar,</HI> and is generally &s;up|po&s;ed to have been born in the &s;outh of <HI>France.</HI> He was a man of uncommon abilities. After leading a vagabond life through various parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in which he acted the part of a mo&s;t con&s;ummate impo&s;tor, and &s;uffering frequently the greate&s;t mi|&s;ery from his profligate life, he was reduced to become a com|mon &s;oldier in a <HI>Scotch</HI> regiment at <HI>Sluys;</HI> there he fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the character of the <HI>Japane&s;e. Innes,</HI> a worthle&s;s chaplain of
<PB N="152" REF="166">the corps, undertook his conver&s;ion, not through principle, but the hopes of promotion on his arrival in <HI>England. Innes</HI> had di&s;|covered him to be an impo&s;tor, but for their joint intere&s;t they united in the deceit. <HI>P&s;almanazar</HI> formed a <HI>Formo&s;an</HI> alphabet; he pretended to be converted in form, was baptized by <HI>Innes</HI> by the name of <HI>George,</HI> and the credulous governor of <HI>Sluys</HI> &s;tood godfather. <HI>Innes</HI> had, by his corre&s;pondence with the good <HI>Compton,</HI> the bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> been encouraged to bring him to our capital. The prelate was made mo&s;t completely the dupe of the&s;e villains. <HI>P&s;almanazar</HI> had many patrons and many op|ponents, but his abilities and impudence baffled all detection. He undertook a hi&s;tory of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> (which he pretended was &s;ubject to <HI>Japan</HI>), a mo&s;t fabulous compo&s;ition; yet, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are always delighted with the marvellous, it was &s;o gree|dily bought up as to induce him to prepare a &s;econd edition. <HI>Innes</HI> attained his end, got preferment, and then ba&s;ely de&s;erted the cau&s;e of his promotion. <HI>P&s;almanazar</HI> lived &s;ome time by various tricks and impo&s;tures. At length, at the age of thirty|eight, he began to feel compunction at the infamy of his life, and was &s;truck with mo&s;t &s;incere remor&s;e. He became a mo&s;t lively penitent, and applied his great abilities to u&s;eful learning. He wrote his own life, which was not to be publi&s;hed till after his death. I believe it to be a true narrative, and that he con|cealed nothing but his real name and the place of his birth, fearing to leave reproach upon his family. The li&s;t of his works, many of which are on important &s;ubjects, may be found in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xxxv. p. 13.</NOTE>. He lived till <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1763, when he died

<P>THE golden fi&s;h is of the mo&s;t vivid colors; <HI>Linnaeus</HI> names it <HI>Cyprinus auratus;</HI> the gold is highly re&s;plendent, but varies in part of the &s;ame fi&s;h into the brighte&s;t &s;ilver or riche&s;t blues which can be imagined.

<P><Q>THE prettie&s;t of them are of a curious red, &s;peckled as it were with gold du&s;t, e&s;pecially towards the tail, which is forked with two or three points; &s;ome are of a &s;ilver color, others white, and &s;ome &s;potted with red; both &s;orts are extraordinary lively and active, delighting to play on the &s;urface of the water; but then their &s;mallne&s;s renders them &s;o tender, that the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of air, and even any violent &s;haking of the ve&s;&s;el, will kill great numbers of them. Tho&s;e that are bred in ponds are of various &s;izes; &s;ome are bigger than our large&s;t pilchards; they teach them to ri&s;e up to the top of the water at the noi&s;e of a clapper, which the per&s;on u&s;es who feeds them. What is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing is, that according to all accounts, the be&s;t way to pre&s;erve them is to give them
<PB N="158" REF="172">nothing in winter; it is certain they do not feed them for three or four months at <HI>Peking,</HI> while the very cold weather la&s;ts; what they live on in the mean time, under the ice, it is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand, except we &s;uppo&s;e, either that they find little worms in the roots of herbs, which grow at the bottom of the ponds, or el&s;e, that pieces of roots them|&s;elves, being &s;oftened by the water, become proper food for them; but tho&s;e which, to prevent their being frozen, are taken into the hou&s;es, and kept all winter in a chamber, often &s;hut up in a china ve&s;&s;el, without being fed at all, are towards &s;pring put into the ba&s;ins again, where they &s;port with the &s;ame &s;trength and agility as they did the year before.

The wall is all the way from twenty to twenty-five feet high, generally ca&s;ed with brick, and terra&s;&s;ed at top of a breadth &s;ufficient for five or &s;ix hor&s;emen to ride a-brea&s;t.

<P>THIS great protection of <HI>China</HI> is not uniformly built of the &s;ame materials. In &s;ome places the walls, and even the forts, are of earth.

In a certain tract a great trench is cut to &s;upply the place of the wall; and on the banks of the fierce river <HI>Whang-ho,</HI> or the yellow, are &s;eries of &s;entry-boxes, filled with &s;oldiers, who keep watch night and day.

<P>THE length of the wall, in a &s;trait line, is &s;even or eight hun|dred miles, and allowing for the windings, for the a&s;cents over the craggy mountains, or de&s;cent into the deep vallies, may be e&s;timated at double that length. Yet what may ju&s;tly excite our admiration is, that this &s;tupendous work was &s;aid to have been completed in the &s;pace of five years.

This is the &s;pecies which gave the name of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> or rather <HI>Rhabarb</HI> to this drug, the plant being fir&s;t ob&s;erved near to the banks of the ancient <HI>Rha,</HI> or river <HI>Volga;</HI> the &s;ame pre|&s;cribed by <HI>Paulus Aeginatus</HI> as one of the ingredients for a purge, under the name of <HI>Rheum Ponticum;</HI> perhaps the trivial might be derived from its being brought from &s;ome part of <HI>Pontus,</HI> to which it was carried from its place of growth. <HI>Pliny</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. xxvii. c. 12.</NOTE> mentions a plant with a medicinal root called <HI>Rhacoma;</HI> he &s;ays it came
<PB N="174" REF="188">from the countries beyond the kingdom of <HI>Pontus,</HI> and by the name, probably from the <HI>Rha.</HI> He de&s;cribes its u&s;es, but none of them are &s;imilar to that of the rhubarb; I cannot therefore venture to &s;ay that it is the &s;ame plant.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Chine&s;e Tartary</HI> the <HI>Bobak Marmots,</HI> (Hi&s;t. Quad. ii. N^o 324) are &s;aid to be the propagators of Rhubarb. Wherever ten or twenty plants grow you are &s;ure of &s;inding &s;everal burrows under the &s;hades of their broad &s;preading leaves. It is probable the ma|nure they depo&s;it about the roots contributes not a little to its in|crea&s;e; and their ca&s;ting up the earth makes it &s;hoot out young buds and multiply. It appears that the <HI>Mongalls</HI> never accounted it worth cultivating; but that the world is obliged to the <HI>Marmots</HI> for the quantities &s;cattered, at random, in many di&s;tricts of this country. For whatever part of the ripe &s;eed happens to be blown among the thick gra&s;s, can very &s;eldom reach the ground but mu&s;t there wither and die; whereas, &s;hould it fall among the loo&s;e earth thrown up by tho&s;e animals, it immediately takes root, and produces a new plant.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> call rhubarb <HI>Tay-whang;</HI> they u&s;e it nearly in the &s;ame manner as is done in <HI>Europe;</HI> e&s;teem its virtues much as we do, except that which comes from <HI>Canton:</HI> the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> or mo&s;t valuable, is engro&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who purcha&s;e it at their town of <HI>Kiachta</HI> (a little &s;outh of lake <HI>Bai|kal)</HI> from <HI>Bucharian</HI> merchants, and &s;end it to <HI>Peter&s;burgh.</HI> This is called the <HI>Turkey Rhubarb,</HI> becau&s;e formerly it was brought from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the merchants there receiving it from the <HI>Bucharians,</HI> who now find a readier market near home. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> prohibit the exportation of the be&s;t rhubarb under

<P>THE <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> were charmed with the di&s;covery of a river which report made to fling up gold and &s;ilver; and its neigh|borhood to abound with the mo&s;t pretious &s;ables, cattle, fruit, and grain; and its inhabitants to be clad in nothing but dama&s;k and gold brocades: in &s;hort, it was repre&s;ented as a land of <HI>Ca|naan.</HI> The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> coloni&s;ts of the neighboring places migrated thither in crowds, and depopulated their former country. They founded a fort in Lat. 53&deg;,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORT ALBUSIN.</NOTE> which they called <HI>Alba&s;in,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;e, Jak&s;a,</HI> from the river near which it was &s;eated. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> burnt it in 1680; but it was re&s;ounded, and at length &s;trongly garri&s;oned, till it gave &s;uch &s;erious cau&s;e of jealou&s;y to that na|tion as to bring on the treaty which occa&s;ioned its total demoli|tion. It is no wonder that they were alarmed: the borders of the river were remarkably fertile, had numbers of large cities, and a mo&s;t populous territory; be&s;ides, the mountains to the
<PB N="185" REF="199">north were productive of the riche&s;t &s;ables and other furs, and inhabited by a hardy race of hunters. Had the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> rendered them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the <HI>Amur,</HI> even <HI>Katherine,</HI> the moderate, might have made the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> tremble for the fate of <HI>Peking</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had &s;everal places on the <HI>Argun</HI> of &s;ome im|portance, &s;uch as <HI>Aigun,</HI> or, as it is called by them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AIGUN.</NOTE> <HI>Sachalin ula Choton,</HI> near the junction of the <HI>Seja</HI> with that great river, a fort from which they detached their fleets again&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI> encroachments. <HI>Tondon</HI> is another town, in Lat. 50&deg;, where the cold begins with great &s;everity as early as the beginning of <HI>September;</HI> later in the year the greate&s;t rivers are frozen over. Tigers inhabit even the&s;e high Latitudes. This country was vi&s;ited and &s;urveyed by &s;ome of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, by order of <HI>Kang-hi.</HI> Whoever wi&s;hes to gratify his curio&s;ity farther, may con&s;ult <HI>Du Halde,</HI> vol. ii. p. 245, and the following pages.</P>
<P>THE country is full of fore&s;ts; the mi&s;&s;ionaries were nine days in pa&s;&s;ing through one.

They carry on a commerce with <HI>Satzuma,</HI> and vi&s;it it once a year; they have there a company of merchants, but are confined in their commerce to that port, and limited to the value of their trade, but by the connivance of the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> officers, they di&s;po&s;e of an infinitely greater quantity than the law admits. They import into <HI>Satzuma</HI> all kinds of &s;ilks and &s;tuffs, and various <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> commodities, which they carry over in their own jonks, and &s;ome of their own produce, &s;uch as corn, rice, fruit, and pul&s;e, and a &s;ort of brandy made from the remainder of their crops.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEA.</NOTE> 817. <HI>Kaempfer</HI>'s Travels, i. 115. ii. appendix, 2. tab. 38, 39. The tea cultivated in <HI>Japan</HI> is the <HI>Bohea,</HI> the <HI>T&s;jaa</HI> of the <HI>Japane&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Theh</HI> of the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> The origin of it has its legend equal to any in the univer&s;e. <HI>Darma,</HI> the &s;on of an <HI>Indian</HI> king, who flouri&s;hed about the year 519 of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> era, arrived in <HI>China</HI> to preach his doctrine to the inhabitants. It &s;eems he was a &s;ort of pope in <HI>India,</HI> the twenty-eighth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the founder of ea&s;tern pagani&s;m. He had vowed the greate&s;t au|&s;terities, particularly a perpetual watchfulne&s;s; nature, worn out, was obliged at length to &s;ubmit to the refre&s;hment of &s;leep; on fini&s;hing his &s;lumbers, he cut off both his eye-brows, which had dared to clo&s;e, and flinging them on the ground, each became a &s;hrub; <HI>Darma</HI> eat &s;ome of the leaves, and to his great &s;urpri&s;e, found him&s;elf invigorated, &s;o as to undergo any labors or any watchings; he communicated the virtues to his di&s;ciples, and tea became of univer&s;al u&s;e. It is therefore &s;tyled by &s;ome the eye-brows of <HI>Darma;</HI> he is repre&s;ented as a horrid ugly fellow, with va&s;t eye-brows, wrapped in a great cloak, and &s;tanding on a reed, on which he had been wafted from region to region.</P>
<P>WE may be certain from this tale, that the tea plant was abo|riginal of <HI>China.</HI> It is cultivated by &s;owing, not in whole fields, but round the borders in rows, &s;o that it may not hurt the land; good farmers manure the plants with human ordure. In &s;even
<PB N="216" REF="228">years time it grows to the height of a man; its few leaves, at that time are gathered, the &s;hrub cut down, and the mo&s;t plentiful harve&s;t is obtained from the vigorous &s;hoots of the &s;ucceeding years.</P>
<P>THE leaves are gathered by laborers, peculiarly brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s; they mu&s;t not be taken by handfuls, but pulled off one by one. The trees are not &s;tripped entirely, for there are three gatherings in the year. The leaves are &s;orted into three parcels; the fine&s;t, the &s;mall, tender, primaeval &s;hoots, are re|&s;erved for princes and great men, and on that account called imperial. They are next prepared by drying over the fire in an iron pan, and after that rolled with the palm of the hand on a mat, in order to fold them. Public laboratories are built for the purpo&s;e. All the proce&s;&s;es are given at large by <HI>Kaempfer</HI>

<P>TEA is in as univer&s;al u&s;e in <HI>Japan</HI> as in <HI>China,</HI> and taken two ways.

<Q>grows in the woods and mountains of <HI>Japan,</HI> and produces many varieties, differing much in habit, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by different names. Yet, amid&s;t all this variety, <HI>Thunberg</HI> ob|&s;erves that he never had the &s;atisfaction of meeting with a &s;ingle plant of it in the flowering &s;tate. This is not to be wondered at, when we are informed by <HI>Reede,</HI> Mal. v. i. p. 25. that it does not flower till it has attained the age of about &s;ixty years, and what is very remarkable, &s;heds its leaves a month previous to the time of flowering, and immediately after having perfected its fruit, withers and dies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;mall &s;lender walking canes, &s;o much admired for their elegant rings, are obtained from young irregular &s;uckers or &s;hoots of the bambo, which &s;pring from the root, after the main &s;tem has been repeatedly cut down. Nature has not formed them preci&s;ely of the figure in which we receive them. They are originally crooked and pliant, and much art is u&s;ed, by &s;u&s;pended weights attached to them, and the application of &s;moke, to render them &s;trait and &s;tiff. It is farther nece&s;&s;ary to retrench with a knife the fibres which adhere to the rings, and were intended by nature to propagate the plant, in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Triticum repens</HI> (couch gra&s;s) multiplies its offsets by &s;hoots from the joints.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This &s;pecies of walking &s;tick is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Rotang,</HI> or true cane, not only by its &s;ingular protuberances, but al&s;o by a &s;mall perforation extending through the center
<PB N="226" REF="238">of the whole length of it, which is common to all <HI>Bambus,</HI> and in their mature &s;tate enlarges into &s;pacious cavities, ren|dering this ine&s;timable vegetable &s;ub&s;ervient to a thou&s;and u&s;eful dome&s;tic purpo&s;es. It is only in the i&s;land of <HI>Japan</HI> that the <HI>Bambu</HI> is thus artificially prepared for the purpo&s;e of a walking cane: and con&s;tituting a lucrative article of com|merce, it is counterfeited at <HI>Surat</HI> (upon the <HI>Malabar</HI> coa&s;t) and a &s;purious &s;ort made of a different wood impo&s;ed upon the ignorant. The name of <HI>Bambu</HI> is not <HI>Indian,</HI> but was given to this plant by <HI>Europeans,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ive of the violent ex|plo&s;ion that comes upon committing its branches to the flames, the report of which is &s;aid to equal that of the firing of guns, and is cau&s;ed by the rarefaction of great quantities of air, which had been impri&s;oned in its numerous chambers.

<P>THAT country cannot properly be &s;aid to have been di&s;covered by the <HI>Europeans</HI> till the year 1542,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DISCOVERED BY THE POR|TUGUESE.</NOTE> by three <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> named <HI>de Mota, Zeimoto,</HI> and <HI>Peixolo;</HI> the&s;e, as I have before mentioned, in common with the re&s;t of their countrymen, in&s;tigated by avarice, had &s;ailed from <HI>Malacca</HI> in &s;earch of an imaginary &s;pot, called the <HI>i&s;land of gold.</HI> Driven by a hurricane, they were wrecked on the &s;hores of <HI>Japan:</HI> The lord of the di&s;trict re|ceived
<PB N="249" REF="261">them with great humanity, and &s;ignified an earne&s;t de|&s;ire of entering into a commerce with a nation which he flattered him&s;elf would be &s;o advantageous to him and his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>IT was at this period that <HI>Francis de Xavier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRANCIS DE XAVIER,</NOTE> the great apo&s;tle of the <HI>Indies,</HI> was deeply engaged in his mi&s;&s;ion in the penin&s;ula of <HI>Malacca.</HI> His fame had reached <HI>Japan,</HI> when a native of the country determined to make a vi&s;it to that part of <HI>India,</HI> to be &s;atisfied of the truth of the wonders reported to have been wrought by <HI>de Xavier.</HI> He came, attended by two &s;ervants, was converted to Chri&s;tianity, and adopted the name of <HI>Paul</HI> of the <HI>Holy Faith;</HI> &s;o zealous was he in his new religion, that he may truly be called the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of <HI>Japan. De Xavier</HI> determined to attend him to his native country. He a&s;&s;ociated with him two Je&s;uits, &s;ailed and landed in 1551 at <HI>Kangoxima,</HI> in the kingdom of <HI>Satzuma,</HI> on the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land of <HI>Kiu&s;iu,</HI> and &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Firando,</HI> a &s;mall i&s;land, where he, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Paul,</HI> made converts innumerable.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INTRODUCES CHRISTIANITY.</NOTE> His zeal then determined him to vi&s;it the emperor, at the royal city of <HI>Miaco;</HI> he arrived at the court, and was received with much re&s;pect. The mul|titude of pro&s;elytes was incredible. The benevolence and hu|manity of our religion were the principal in&s;truments with which the mi&s;&s;ionaries operated on the minds of the people, who compared the conduct of the Chri&s;tian preachers with that of their own <HI>Bonzees.</HI> The la&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that all &s;ick and infirm people are the objects of the wrath of Heaven, and con&s;tantly leave them to peri&s;h. The mi&s;&s;ionaries ob&s;erved the precepts of our Saviour; they fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, and admini&s;tered to the &s;ick. The&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible proofs of the &s;uperior
<PB N="250" REF="262">excellency of our doctrine, gave &s;ucce&s;s to their labours; for near a century the true religion flouri&s;hed, and &s;pread more and more over the empire. Other circum&s;tances concurred to fa|cilitate the reception of the go&s;pel in <HI>Japan.</HI> The <HI>Bonzees</HI> preached the nece&s;&s;ity of mediators in their <HI>Xaca</HI> and other gods; they underwent long and &s;evere fa&s;ts and mortifications, and both Chri&s;tians and <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> agreed in the wor&s;hipping of images, in the mona&s;tic life, in beads, proce&s;&s;ions, praying for the dead, and even auricular confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> were followed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JESUITS, &amp;c.</NOTE> as occurred in <HI>China,</HI> by crowds of <HI>Dominicans, Franci&s;cans,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tlines</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the harve&s;t. The holy men &s;oon fell into the &s;ame error as in that empire; they quickly began to quarrel with the Je&s;uits, accu&s;ed them of avarice, and of temporizing with the vices and &s;uper&s;titions of the <HI>Japane&s;e.</HI> Let the reader peru&s;e p. 98 of this volume, and he will learn the imprudency of all the&s;e religious adventurers.</P>
<P>THE va&s;t profits re&s;ulting from the commercial and worldly &s;pirit of the Je&s;uits, were one cau&s;e of the toleration which the Chri&s;tian religion experienced for &s;o great a length of time. The emperors &s;aw the wealth the <HI>Europeans</HI> brought into their country; and as long as the Chri&s;tians did not di&s;turb the peace of the government, they permitted the conver&s;ion of their &s;ub|jects, and the exerci&s;e of our religion. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;ettled at fir&s;t at the harbors of <HI>Bungo</HI> and <HI>Firando,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Naga&s;aki</HI> only. They carried on immen&s;e trade; and in one year exported not le&s;s than three hundred tons of gold from <HI>Miaco,</HI> the emporium, at that time, of all their commerce in this part of the world. In the year 1636, when their trade was on
<PB N="251" REF="263">the decline, they even &s;ent from that town 2350 che&s;ts of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> introduced them&s;elves into <HI>Japan</HI> about the year 1600, e&s;tabli&s;hed their fir&s;t factory at <HI>Firando,</HI> and obtained from the emperor a patent for a free commerce. The deep enmity between them and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;oon began to &s;hew it&s;elf, and each nation took every po&s;&s;ible means to &s;upplant its rival. In the year 1636 an opportunity offered.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONSPIRACY.</NOTE> The <HI>Dutch</HI> happened to take a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;hip, in which were found certain letters from a captain <HI>Moro</HI> to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> mini&s;try at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> wherein he had laid a plan for murdering the emperor, and reducing the empire to the power of his countrymen. <HI>Moro</HI> was a <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> by birth, chief of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in <HI>Japan,</HI> and very zealous for the Chri&s;tian religion. The letters were carefully tran&s;mitted to the emperor. <HI>Moro</HI> was empaled, and burnt alive. After a little time an edict followed, which entirely bani&s;hed every foreigner from the empire, with the mo&s;t rigid prohibition of their ever entering it again. A per&s;ecution was rai&s;ed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERSECUTION.</NOTE> perhaps the mo&s;t horrid that ever was known; it la&s;ted forty years, and thou&s;ands peri&s;hed by the mo&s;t dreadful torments; it was computed that above a third of the people of the empire were profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity. The puni&s;hments tho&s;e mi|&s;erable creatures underwent are not to be related, the inventions of Hell it&s;elf mu&s;t have been put to the &s;tretch.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 253.</NOTE>, which he will probably &s;hut with the &s;ame horror as I did. Let me only add, that the
<PB N="252" REF="264">boiling water mentioned by me at p. 247 of this work, was one of the in&s;truments of torture, varied and lengthened by the mo&s;t diabolical inventions. Tho&s;e of <HI>Singok</HI> were the mo&s;t horrible; they flow with va&s;t violence and noi&s;e beneath a lofty precipice, and emit the mo&s;t noi&s;ome &s;ulphureous vapor, which ri&s;es to a great height. Hither the Chri&s;tians were brought in multitudes; and in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to renounce their religion, were carried bound to the &s;ummit of the mountain, and precipitated into the &s;ubjacent <HI>Phlegethon.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to impre&s;s on every &s;ubject a dete&s;tation of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TREADING ON THE CRUCIFIX.</NOTE> and po&s;&s;ibly to di&s;cover if there be any latent favorers of its doctrine, the following annual cu&s;tom is pre&s;erved throughout the empire: people of all ranks and periods of life, even to children of a certain age, are a&s;&s;embled in the different places, where they perform the ceremony of trampling upon the cro&s;s. It was even &s;aid to have been a rite exacted from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as the price of their commerce with the <HI>Japane&s;e. Swift,</HI> in his voyage to <HI>Laputa,</HI> is humorous on the &s;ubject; for when <HI>Gulliver,</HI> under the character of a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> petitions the em|peror to be excu&s;ed the ceremony, his maje&s;ty, much &s;urpri&s;ed, tells him, that he was the fir&s;t of his countrymen who ever made any &s;cruple, and that he &s;u&s;pected he mu&s;t be a Chri&s;tian, and not a <HI>Hollander.</HI>

But what will not a <HI>Dutchman</HI> do for gain! They make from the factory an annual journey to the em|peror's court, which they dignify with the name of emba&s;&s;y; but it is no more than a compul&s;ory vi&s;it to pre&s;ent their gifts: their manner of travelling, both on their way and on their re|turn, is under a &s;trict guard, more like that of a parcel of con|victs, than the merchants of a great commercial nation. One &s;hip only is permitted to trade with this empire annually, and that is confined to the port of <HI>Naga&s;aki,</HI> in the little i&s;le of <HI>De|&s;ima,</HI> on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land <HI>Kiu&s;iu.</HI> In fact, this is the only &s;ecure harbor in all the mighty empire of <HI>Japan.</HI> As &s;oon as a ve&s;&s;el arrives, a <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> guard is put on board; the number, &s;ize, age, and complexion of the crew noted down; every living creature in the ve&s;&s;el is to be accounted for; a monkey died, and the coroner's inque&s;t &s;at on the body. The next thing done is to take an exact inventory of, and to cau&s;e all the &s;ails, ma&s;ts, ropes, rudder, guns, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and all the tackle of the &s;hips, to be conveyed into the emperor's warehou&s;e, there to be kept under lock and &s;eal till the time comes for their departure, when they are re&s;tored, according to the inventory taken, of which both parties have an exact duplicate

<P>THE fir&s;t time that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> traded directly with <HI>Japan,</HI>

<P>THE <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had once prodigious commerce in this empire,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHINESE.</NOTE> and came and &s;ettled in any numbers they plea&s;ed; but in time
<PB N="256" REF="268">the jealous <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> took umbrage at the va&s;t concour&s;e of tho&s;e foreigners, and at length confined them to a certain precinct, near the &s;ame i&s;land with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They are allowed to have three &s;ales in the year, one in &s;pring, when they are permitted to di&s;|po&s;e of the cargoes of twenty jonks, a &s;econd of thirty jonks, and a third in autumn of twenty.

<P>THE religion of the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> is idolatry:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR DEITIES.</NOTE> their deities are amaz|ingly numerous; tradition &s;ays that they had been men eminent for their piety or mortification, deified after death for their &s;e|veral virtues. They al&s;o hold that their earlie&s;t emperors were gods and demi-gods, and that during the fir&s;t period, they were governed by &s;even great cele&s;tial &s;pirits, each of which reigned a certain, but immen&s;e number of years. Their temples are very numerous, di&s;per&s;ed not only over the cities, but even the moun|tains and de&s;erts. Their idols a&s;&s;ume a thou&s;and extravagant forms, and colo&s;&s;al &s;izes; in one of their temples is an idol of copper gilt, the very chair it &s;its on is &s;eventy feet high, and the head &s;o large as to be capable of containing fifteen men; many of them work miracles, and bring abundance of gain to the temple or mona&s;tery which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A TEMPLE near <HI>Miaco</HI> takes its name from its number of idols, which amount to 33,333; Doctor <HI>Kaempfer</HI> gives us a view

<P>THE mona&s;tic life is much in vogue in <HI>Japan.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONASTIC LIFE.</NOTE> The mona|&s;teries are filled with regulars and &s;eculars, like tho&s;e of the

They pa&s;s their time amid&s;t the holy mountains, and practi&s;e the greate&s;t morti|fications; the richer live more at their ea&s;e in their own hou&s;es. This order is now divided into two &s;ects, one called <HI>Jofanfa,</HI> the votaries of which bind them&s;elves to a&s;cend once a year the great mountain of <HI>Fikoa&s;an,</HI> a journey of va&s;t difficulty, by rea&s;on of its heights and dreadful precipices, but &s;till more tremendous on account of the penalty attending any impure per|&s;on making the attempt; he infallibly is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the devil of the mountain, and becomes &s;tark mad. The other &s;ect is named <HI>Fon&s;an&s;a;</HI> this likewi&s;e is obliged to make an annual pilgrimage to the &s;ummit of the <HI>Omine,</HI> a mountain not le&s;s terrible than the other; but &s;hould any one pre&s;ume to a&s;cend it without being duly prepared by purification, he is certain of being flung down the precipices, or &s;eized with a lingering illne&s;s, the pe|nalties of his neglect.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> religion is &s;plit into a multitude of &s;ects;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VARIOUS SECTS.</NOTE> each differ in &s;ome tenets, yet all agree in five indi&s;pen&s;ible com|mandments. 1. They are not to kill, or eat of any thing that is killed; 2. they are not to &s;teal; 3. nor to lie; 4. nor to com|mit adultery; 5. nor to drink wine. Is it not evident that they brought with them, on the di&s;per&s;ion of mankind, &s;ome of
<PB N="258" REF="270">the Mo&s;aical laws, and in the la&s;t that they had adopted the rite of the <HI>Rechabites?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Japan</HI> has its peculiar language,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LANGUAGE.</NOTE> different from all the <HI>A&s;iatic,</HI> and probably the primitive one, brought over by the coloni&s;ts who originally peopled the i&s;lands, and came directly from the banks of the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> on the di&s;per&s;ion of mankind after the confu&s;ion of languages. The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> have an opinion that the primoeval emigrants &s;ettled in the province of <HI>I&s;je;</HI> numbers therefore make a pilgrimage annually to the antient &s;pot, the place where their ance&s;tors dwelt, and as &s;uch honor it with pe|culiar acts of devotion.

<P><HI>Japan</HI> is governed by two emperors;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT. SECULAR.</NOTE> one called the <HI>Cubo,</HI> or &s;ecular monarch, who rules with ab&s;olute power; all the princes and great lords of the empire pay him the mo&s;t &s;ervile obedience.
<PB N="259" REF="271">Formerly the whole was divided into &s;mall independent &s;tates, the rulers were &s;tiled kings and princes, many of which retain the names, and govern ab&s;olute enough; but entirely under the direction of the emperor.</P>
<P>THE antient title of the monarch was <HI>Dairo;</HI> he was al&s;o &s;overeign pontiff, and like the pope the &s;upreme head of the church. In that character his per&s;on was held &s;o &s;acred, that little &s;hort of divine wor&s;hip was paid to him; for a long pe|riod he governed by means of a prime mini&s;ter, who was called the <HI>Cubo,</HI> a dignity u&s;ually be&s;towed on one of his younger &s;ons; the father, like other ea&s;tern monarchs, devoting his whole time to indolence and &s;en&s;uality. At length a <HI>Cubo</HI> aro&s;e, who de|throned the <HI>Dairo,</HI> or rather u&s;urped his more important office, that of &s;ecular emperor; he permitted him to retain that of pon|tiff.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ECCLESIAS|TICAL.</NOTE> The <HI>Cubo</HI> thus &s;tripped him of all &s;ort of power except eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, but pre&s;erves the farce of paying him all external re&s;pect, as much as if he had enjoyed the antient plenitude of authority; he renders him an imaginary homage, and pretends to act only as his deputy, and to hold the empire from him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dairo</HI> was permitted to re&s;ide in the palace, in the old im|perial city of <HI>Miaco,</HI> and to keep up the antient &s;tate, but that is now done with difficulty, as the <HI>Cubos</HI> have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively le&s;&s;ened the revenues.

Crucifixion is very com|mon; &s;ometimes the malefactor is crucified erect, &s;ometimes with the head down. I have little doubt but that the&s;e puni&s;h|ments were unknown in the empire, till the propagation of Chri&s;tianity. The ideas were taken from the crucifixes of the Chri&s;tians, and from the pictures of the &s;uffering of our SAVIOR. The mode in which death was inflicted on the apo&s;tle St. <HI>Peter,</HI> probably gave ri&s;e to that variation of cruelty in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>THE puni&s;hment for gentlemen and &s;oldiers is ripping open the belly. As a peculiar favor, they are &s;ometimes permitted to be their own executioners. The emperor &s;ends his mandate; the per&s;on whom he &s;o favors, receives it with the utmo&s;t re|&s;pect; makes a great fea&s;t, and on the conclu&s;ion puts the im|perial order in execution, in the very pre&s;ence of his friends and family.</P>
<P>FROM the variety of feature and form of body in the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> of the &s;everal provinces, it is evident they are de&s;cended from different races of people, who have migrated, or have been ca&s;t on the coa&s;ts at various times. "Thus," &s;ays <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> i. 95.

<P>THE <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> are fond of good paintings,

<PB N="271" REF="283">noted only with dotted lines, even as high as the &s;outh end of the i&s;land of <HI>Sachalin.</HI> The intermediate &s;pace is the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;treight of <HI>Je&s;o.</HI> Whether the land of <HI>Je&s;o</HI> is, as Mr. <HI>M&uuml;ller</HI> con|jectures, any more than an archipelago, or whether it is part of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> continent, at pre&s;ent remains extremely doubtful. <HI>Mat&s;umai</HI> alone &s;eems to have been proved to be an i&s;land.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The voyage of the unfortunate <HI>de la Perou&s;e,</HI> has thrown con&s;iderable light on the hitherto unde&s;cribed land of <HI>Je&s;o,</HI> and the op|po&s;ite &s;hore of <HI>Tartary.</HI> After coa&s;ting for &s;ome time the inho&s;pitable i&s;les of <HI>Japan,</HI> that able navigator traver&s;ed the intervening &s;ea, till he came in &s;ight of the continent of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in Lat. 42&deg;, which he followed in a northerly di|rection, and in Lat. 45&deg; 13&prime; landed at the <HI>Baie de Ternai.</HI> Here he found a country of the mo&s;t abundant vegetation, but &s;hewing no &s;igns of being occupied, except by wandering hunt|ers, or occa&s;ional vi&s;itants by &s;ea. Game of all kinds were &s;een in quantities, and the &s;ea afforded a copious &s;upply of cod, herring, and falmon. In an excur&s;ion inland, &s;ome of the party di&s;covered a tomb, in which were depo&s;ited two bodies clad in the &s;kin of bears, <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> coin, and copper ornaments were attached to their girdles, and near them lay &s;ilver earings, an iron hatchet, a knife, a wooden &s;poon, a comb, and a &s;mall bag of rice.</P>
<P>Still pur&s;uing the coa&s;ts of <HI>Chine&s;e Tartary,</HI> the navigators touched at a bay to which they gave the name of <HI>Suffrein,</HI> &s;ituated in Lat. 47&deg; 51&prime;; continual fogs retarded their progre&s;s. In Lat. 48&deg; 35&prime; they di&s;covered to the ea&s;t the apparently rocky and barren &s;hores of the no|minal land of <HI>Je&s;o,</HI> part of the va&s;t i&s;land <HI>Tehoka</HI> or <HI>Sachalin,</HI> to which they &s;ailed. They found the inhabitants advanced to a con&s;iderable de|gree of civilization in con&s;equence of their intercour&s;e with the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> parts of who&s;e dre&s;s they had adopted, and with whom, and the <HI>Mantchew Tartars,</HI> they carried on a trade in dried fi&s;h and oil. Leaving the&s;e intelligent i&s;landers, who had traced on the &s;and with al|mo&s;t geographical accuracy the object of his farther enquiry, <HI>de la Perou&s;e</HI> proceeded north|wards, and touched at a &s;pot he denominated <HI>Baie d'E&s;taing;</HI> the channel between <HI>Tehoka</HI> and the continent narrowed to the di&s;tance of twelve leagues; the &s;oundings al&s;o became gra|dually le&s;s, and in Lat. 51&deg; 45&prime; did not exceed nine fathoms. The enterprizing &s;pirit of a <HI>Cook</HI> or a <HI>Vancouver</HI> &s;eemed here wanting; <HI>de la Perou&s;e,</HI> after a trial of a few hours, remained &s;atisfied that a bank of &s;and, over which boats only could pa&s;s, connected the &s;hores and clo&s;ed the extremity of the va&s;t gulf. He however draws the ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, that the i&s;land called <HI>Sachalin</HI> by the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ians,</HI> the northern extremity of which has long been known, extends from the 46th to the 54th degrees of latitude, and con&s;equently includes a portion of the <HI>Yedzo,</HI> or <HI>Je&s;o</HI> of our geographers. The &s;traights which &s;eparate this i&s;land from that of <HI>Mat&s;umay,</HI> are a&s;cer|tained with accuracy, and ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the French navigator.&mdash;On the return of the &s;hips from their fruitle&s;s at|tempt to penetrate into the &s;ea of <HI>Ochot&s;k,</HI> they entered the <HI>Baie de Ca&s;tries,</HI> on the coa&s;t of <HI>Tartary.</HI> Here was &s;ituated a &s;mall village, inhabited by a race who&s;e high cheek bones and &s;mall eyes announced its origin; but it appeared only the occa&s;ional re&s;idence of dif|ferent tribes for the purpo&s;e of fi&s;hing, who carry the produce of their labor to the <HI>Mant|chew Tartars,</HI> living on the banks of the great river <HI>Segalien</HI> or <HI>Amur,</HI> from whom they re|ceive in exchange for their dried &s;almon, grain, nanquin, and other articles probably brought from <HI>China.</HI> The cu&s;tom of leaving in their huts, during the long &s;ea&s;on of ab&s;ence for the purpo&s;es of commerce, their bows, arrows, nets, and &s;uch furniture as their few wants require, con&s;titutes an intere&s;ting proof of the hone&s;ty of this harmle&s;s race of people; in &s;everal par|ticulars they agree with the natives of <HI>Kam|chatka;</HI> and tombs far exceeding the propor|tion of the apparent population, excited &s;imilar a&s;toni&s;hment, and gives the &s;ame cau&s;e for in|ve&s;tigation, as the numerous memorials of the dead on the coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> ob&s;erved by <HI>Van|couver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De la Perou&s;e,</HI> after doubling <HI>Cape Crillon,</HI> the &s;outhern extremity of the i&s;land <HI>Sachalin,</HI> in Lat. 45&deg; 57&prime;, landed in a &s;ecure bay, inhabited by a tribe of a darker complexion than tho&s;e of the north, and more indu&s;trious; their uten&s;ils and dre&s;s &s;hewed their intercour&s;e with the <HI>Japane&s;e.</HI> The di&s;tance from hence to the northern &s;hores of the i&s;le of <HI>Mat&s;amay,</HI> does not exceed twelve leagues. The navigators here fell into the track, and had the opportunity of rendering ju&s;tice to the veracity, of the Dutch voyagers in 1643. E.</P></NOTE>

<P>THE account given by the commander of the <HI>Ca&s;tricom,</HI> con|curs in a great mea&s;ure with the above. The author of the <HI>Recueil de Voyages au Nord,</HI> vol. iv. has pre&s;erved the voyage. It appears that the captain had landed in &s;everal places; that in Lat. 44&deg; 30&prime;, he found the country very mountanous and high, co|vered with lofty trees, many of which were fit for ma&s;ts; the &s;oil very clayey and wet, and near the &s;hores covered with bru&s;h|wood; it was reported that there were &s;everal rich &s;ilver mines.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 45&deg; 10&prime;,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACQUIES.</NOTE> at a place called <HI>Acquies,</HI> the land was very high, and covered with trees. The &s;oil clayey, but producing good fruits, &s;uch as mulberries, red and white goo&s;eberries, ra&s;pberries, &amp;c. al&s;o oaks and other kinds of trees, and in the vallies lilies of a va&s;t height. The rivers are bordered by ru&s;hes, and al&s;o with red ro&s;es.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 46&deg; 30&prime;, he fell into a great gulph abounding with &s;almon, the &s;hore was covered with vegetables, and had the ap|pearance of the coa&s;ts of <HI>England;</HI> but the natives neither cul|tivated the ground, nor made any advantage of their rich &s;oil. The mo&s;t northern part of the range which he touched at on this coa&s;t, was in Lat. 48&deg; 50&prime;, where he found the land ri&s;e into little hills cloathed with herbage; and met with good ancho|rage, in from 25 to 40 fathoms depth, with a bottom of &s;and.</P>
<P>HE &s;peaks in general of the inhabitants of the coa&s;t of <HI>Je&s;o</HI> as being &s;trong and &s;quare made,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF JESO.</NOTE> &s;hort and gro&s;s, their hair and beard long, and the la&s;t &s;o thick as almo&s;t to cover their whole face; their bodies likewi&s;e very hairy; the hair on the
<PB N="275" REF="287">fore part of the head is &s;haved. The features are tolerably good, their eyes black, forehead flat, complexion yellow; both &s;exes wear rings in their ears and on their fingers. Their dre&s;s is of the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> fa&s;hion; &s;ome is made of &s;ilk, others of &s;tuff, and others of the &s;kins of animals.</P>
<P>THEIR hou&s;es are built again&s;t the &s;lope of a hill,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSES.</NOTE> con&s;tructed of planks, and covered with the bark of trees; they are &s;up|ported by the trunks, and have an hole at top to let out the &s;moke; their fire-place is in the middle of the floor; their doors &s;o low that they are obliged to creep in. The only fur|niture is matting made by the women; to the&s;e add a cup and a plate of varni&s;hed ware for each individual in the family. In &s;ome re&s;pects the hou&s;es re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>Nootka Sound,</HI> and are in groups of fifteen or twenty, each group about half a league di&s;tant from the other, and each &s;eems to be peopled with a kindred clan.</P>
<P>THE common food of the natives is the lard and oil of whales,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> fi&s;h, and all &s;orts of vegetables, e&s;pecially the fruit of ro&s;es, which are as large as medlars, and being dried, are con&s;idered as excel|lent winter provi&s;ion. Notwith&s;tanding this, they often die of cold or famine. It is cu&s;tomary with them to put their dead into a ca&s;e, and cover them with oy&s;ter-&s;hells; the&s;e are &s;up|ported by four po&s;ts, placed beneath huts neatly made.</P>
<P>THE natives of <HI>Mat&s;umai</HI> &s;hew very few &s;igns of religion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE> nor have they any idols. When they drink, if they are near the fire, they pour a few drops into it; they al&s;o &s;tick in their chambers &s;ome &s;mall rods with little flags at the end. If a
<PB N="276" REF="288">per&s;on falls &s;ick, they cut long &s;lips of the wood, and tie them round the head and arms of the patient.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the rude appearance of the&s;e people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> they are prudent and civilized in their manners, and among &s;trangers pay them the compliment of putting on their be&s;t cloaths.</P>
<P>THEY are a very indolent race; never cultivate the ground, but pa&s;s much of their time on the water in canoes, which they call <HI>praos,</HI> cut out of the trunk of &s;ome great tree, rai&s;ed on the &s;ide with planks. In the&s;e they go to the chace of &s;eals, which they &s;hoot with arrows, or of whales, which they harpoon. They be&s;ide catch other fi&s;hes with &s;eines, in the manner done in <HI>Europe.</HI> Several objects of chace are mentioned. Birds they catch in &s;nares; and &s;hoot with arrows elks, roes, &s;tags, bears, and other animals unknown to the <HI>Dutch</HI> navigators. Be&s;ides the weapons I have mentioned, they wear a &s;hort cutla&s;s made of iron, which they procure from the <HI>Japane&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>HEMP grows wild in the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HEMP.</NOTE> the women &s;pin it, I &s;up|po&s;e by &s;plitting it fir&s;t; they then hold one end between their teeth, and turn and twi&s;t it into thread on a di&s;taff.</P>
<P>THE natives exchange with the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> the lard and oil of whales and fi&s;hes, the dried tongues of whales, furs, and fea|thers of eagles, for winging of arrows. The people of <HI>Japan</HI> pay them an annual vi&s;it, and bring in return rice, &s;ugar, &s;ilken cloaths in the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> fa&s;hion, &s;moaking-pipes, tobacco, and varni&s;hed cups and plates. The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> &s;eem to have intro|duced civilization among the&s;e people by their intercour&s;e with
<PB N="277" REF="289">them. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &s;ometimes come and trade with them. The capital of this chain of i&s;lands is called <HI>Mat&s;umai,</HI> and is the re|&s;idence of the prince or governor, who annually makes a voyage to <HI>Jedo,</HI> to do homage to the emperor. The <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> once at|tempted to extend their conque&s;ts from <HI>Mat&s;umai</HI> northward; they &s;ucceeded at fir&s;t, but after a revolt of the inhabitants
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, i. p. 65.</NOTE>, are now content to accept from the chieftain, whom they &s;tile prince of <HI>Je&s;o,</HI> a tribute of very &s;mall value, which is annually paid at <HI>Mat&s;umai.</HI></P>
<P>WE now arrive at the &s;outhernmo&s;t i&s;les of the long chain of the <HI>Kurils.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KURIL ISLES.</NOTE> I have given an account of the mo&s;t northern in my introduction to the <HI>Arctic Zoology.</HI> The whole chain di|verges to the north-ea&s;t in a direct line, and concludes very near to the cape of <HI>Lopatka,</HI> in <HI>Kam&s;chatka.</HI> The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> reckon <HI>Mat&s;umai</HI> among the number. Tho&s;e next to the land of <HI>Je&s;o</HI> were di&s;covered by the <HI>Ca&s;ticrom. T&s;chicota, Kouna&s;chir,</HI> and <HI>Atorkou</HI> are the mo&s;t &s;outhern; the two fir&s;t lie oppo&s;ite to <HI>Mat|&s;umai,</HI> and at no great di&s;tance from its coa&s;ts, and <HI>Atorkou</HI> a little to the north-ea&s;t. <HI>T&s;chicota</HI> is a hundred and twenty ver&s;ts, or ninety miles long, and forty miles broad. <HI>Kouna&s;chir</HI> is about a hundred and twelve miles long, and about thirty-&s;even broad, and <HI>Atorkou,</HI> or <HI>Etorpu,</HI> is equal in length and breadth, being two hundred and twenty-five miles acro&s;s, according to the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI> accounts in the <HI>Neue Nordi&s;che Beytrage</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. 133.</NOTE>. This i&s;land is the <HI>Staten-land</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STATEN-LAND.</NOTE> a name be&s;towed on it in their voyage of 1643.</P>
<P><HI>Ouropi</HI> is the <HI>Company</HI>'s land of the &s;ame voyagers;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">DE VRIES'S STREIGHT.</NOTE> in honor of their commander. No places have puzzled geographers &s;o greatly. <HI>D'Anville</HI> gives to <HI>Je&s;o, Jo&s;oga&s;ima,</HI> as it is &s;ometimes called, the form of a va&s;t i&s;land; and to the <HI>Company's Land</HI> and <HI>Staten-land</HI> a figure po&s;&s;ibly very different from the reality. The editors of <HI>Cook</HI>'s Voyage make them only &s;mall i&s;lands. The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> again, in their hi&s;|tory of <HI>Kam&s;chatka,</HI> give them another form; and Mr. <HI>Arrow-&s;mith</HI> very properly leaves it undecided whether <HI>Je&s;o</HI> is conti|nent or archipelago. This being mentioned, we ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of this volume, and give a brief account of the re|mainder of the <HI>Kuril</HI> i&s;les. <HI>Etorpu,</HI> the nineteenth in order, reckoning from <HI>Lopatka-no&s;s,</HI> comes next. Mo&s;t of the i&s;lands of this long chain are volcanic. <HI>Ra&s;chotti,</HI> the tenth, has in our days been &s;o rent with an earthquake, as entirely to drive away the numerous flocks of birds that u&s;ed to frequent its cliffs; but the &s;ea-lions &s;till keep their &s;tations.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLCANOES.</NOTE> On <HI>Kouna&s;chir,</HI> the twen|tieth, is one volcano; on <HI>Etorpu</HI> are two; on <HI>Amakutan</HI> ano|ther; and on the lofty <HI>Poromo&s;chir,</HI> the highe&s;t in the chain, remarkable for its va&s;t peaked mountains, is probably another. I have treated of the&s;e i&s;lands &s;o fully in my introduction to the <HI>Arctic Zoology,</HI> that I &s;hall not tire my reader with the repeti|tion; I therefore will only &s;ay here, that many of them have been conquered by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who, not thinking them worth the expence of colonizing, content them&s;elves with accepting a &s;mall tribute.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants re&s;emble tho&s;e of the land of <HI>Je&s;o,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> and are equally hairy. By the accounts of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> who vi&s;ited the&s;e
<PB N="279" REF="291">i&s;lands in 1777, they differ in &s;ome of their cu&s;toms from the former. They have multitudes of little hou&s;ehold gods, like the <HI>Mongol Tartars,</HI> and they pay a wor&s;hip to the owl. The <HI>Mon|gols</HI> do the &s;ame, for the rea&s;on given in the zoological part of the <HI>Arctic Zoology</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 272.</NOTE>. This may direct us to the origin of the&s;e i&s;landers. They bury their dead in the earth, and believe in a future life, to be pa&s;&s;ed in certain &s;ubterraneous regions.</P>
