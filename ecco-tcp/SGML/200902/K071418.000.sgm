<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND GENIUS OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the works of a great Writer, who has bequeathed to po&s;terity a la&s;ting legacy, are pre&s;ented to the world, it is naturally expected, that &s;ome account of his life &s;hould accompany the edition. The Reader wi&s;hes to know as much as po&s;&s;ible of the Author. The circum&s;tances that at|tended him, the features of his private cha|racter, his conver&s;ation, and the means by which he ro&s;e to eminence, become the fa|vourite
<PB N="2" REF="4">
objects of enquiry. Curio&s;ity is excited; and the admirer of his works is eager to know his private opinions, his cour&s;e of &s;tudy, the particularities of his conduct, and, above all, whether he pur&s;ued the wi&s;dom which he re|commends, and practi&s;ed the virtue which his writings in&s;pire. A principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous mind. For the entertainment and in&s;truction which genius and diligence have provided for the world, men of refined and &s;en&s;ible tempers are ready to pay their tribute of prai&s;e, and even to form a po&s;thumous friend&s;hip with the author.</P>
<P>In reviewing the life of &s;uch a writer, there is, be&s;ides, a rule of ju&s;tice to which the publick have an undoubted claim. Fond ad|miration and partial friend&s;hip &s;hould not be &s;uffered to repre&s;ent his virtues with exaggera|tion; nor &s;hould malignity be allowed, under a &s;pecious di&s;gui&s;e, to magnify mere defects, the u&s;ual failings of human nature, into vice or gro&s;s deformity. The lights and &s;hades of the character &s;hould be given; and, if this be done with a &s;trict regard to truth, a ju&s;t e&s;ti|mate of Dr. John&s;on will afford a le&s;&s;on per|haps
<PB N="3" REF="5">
as valuable as the moral doctrine that &s;peaks with energy in every page of his works.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent writer enjoyed the conver&s;ation and friend&s;hip of that excellent man more than thirty years. He thought it an honour to be &s;o connected, and to this hour he reflects on his lo&s;s with regret: but regret, he knows, has &s;ecret bribes, by which the judgement may be influenced, and partial affection may be carried beyond the bounds of truth. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, however, nothing needs to be di&s;gui&s;ed, and exaggerated prai&s;e is unnece&s;&s;ary. It is an ob&s;ervation of the younger Pliny, in his Epi&s;tle to his Friend of Tacitus, that hi&s;tory ought never to magnify matters of fact, becau&s;e worthy actions require nothing but the truth. <HI>Nam nec hi&s;toria debet egredi veritatem, et hone&s;te factis veritas &s;ufficit.</HI> This rule the pre&s;ent biographer promi&s;es &s;hall guide his pen throughout the following narrative.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, the death of Dr. John&s;on kept the public mind in agitation beyond all former example. No literary character ever
<PB N="4" REF="6">
excited &s;o much attention; and, when the pre&s;s has teemed with anecdotes, apophthegms, e&s;&s;ays, and publications of every kind, what occa&s;ion now for a new tract on the &s;ame threadbare &s;ubject? The plain truth &s;hall be the an&s;wer. The proprietors of John&s;on's Works thought the life, which they prefixed to their former edition, too unwieldy for re|publication. The prodigious variety of foreign matter, introduced into that performance, &s;eemed to overload the memory of Dr. John|&s;on, and in the account of his own life to leave him hardly vi&s;ible. They wi&s;hed to have a more conci&s;e, and, for that rea&s;on, perhaps a more &s;atisfactory account, &s;uch as may exhibit a ju&s;t picture of the man, and keep him the principal figure in the fore ground of his own picture. To comply with that reque&s;t is the de&s;ign of this e&s;&s;ay, which the writer under|takes with a trembling hand. He has no di&s;|coveries, no &s;ecret anecdotes, no occa&s;ional controver&s;y, no &s;udden fla&s;hes of wit and humour, no private conver&s;ation, and no new facts to embelli&s;h his work. Every thing has been gleaned. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid of him&s;elf, <Q>I am not uncandid, nor &s;evere: I &s;ome|times
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;ay more than I mean, in je&s;t, and people are apt to think me &s;erious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;well's Life of John&s;on, Vol. II. p. 465</NOTE>.</Q> The exerci&s;e of that privilege, which is enjoyed by every man in &s;ociety, has not been allowed to him. His fame has given importance even to trifles, and the zeal of his friends has brought every thing to light. What &s;hould be related, and what &s;hould not, has been publi&s;hed with|out di&s;tinction. <HI>Dicenda tacenda locuti!</HI> Every thing that fell from him has been caught with eagerne&s;s by his admirers, who, as he &s;ays in one of his letters, have acted with the dili|gence of &s;pies upon his conduct. To &s;ome of them the following lines, in Mallet's Poem on Verbal Critici&s;m, are not inapplicable:</P>
<Q><L>"Such that grave bird in Northern &s;eas is found,</L>
<L>"Who&s;e name a Dutchman only knows to &s;ound;</L>
<L>"Where-e'er the king of fi&s;h moves on before,</L>
<L>"This humble friend attends from &s;hore to &s;hore;</L>
<L>"With eye &s;till earne&s;t, and with bill inclin'd,</L>
<L>"He picks up what his patron drops behind,</L>
<L>"With tho&s;e choice cates his palate to regale,</L>
<L>"And is the careful TIBBALD of A WHALE."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">After &s;o many e&s;&s;ays and volumes of <HI>John&s;oni|ana,</HI> what remains for the pre&s;ent writer? Perhaps, what has not been attempted; a &s;hort, yet full, a faithful, yet temperate hi&s;|tory of Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Lichfield, September 7, 1709, O. S <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This appears in a note to John&s;on's Diary, prefixed to the fir&s;t of his prayers. After the alteration of the &s;tile, he kept his birth-day on the 18th of September, and it is accordingly marked September 7/1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. His father, Michael John&s;on, was a book&s;eller in that city; a man of large athletic make, and violent pa&s;&s;ions; wrong-headed, po&s;itive, and at times afflicted with a degree of melancholy, little &s;hort of madne&s;s. His mother was &s;i&s;ter to Dr. Ford, a practi&s;ing phy&s;ician, and father or Cornellus Ford, generally known by the name of PARSON FORD, the &s;ame who is re|pre&s;ented near the punch-bowl in Hogarth's Midnight Modern Conver&s;ation. In the Life of Fanton, John&s;on &s;ays, that <Q>his abilities, in&s;tead or furni&s;hing convivial merriment to the voluptuous and di&s;&s;olute, might have ena|bled him to excel among the virtuous and the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
wife.</Q> Being chaplain to the Earl of Che&s;|terfield, he wi&s;hed to attend that nobleman on his emba&s;&s;y to the Hague. Colley Cibber has recorded the anecdote. "You &s;hould go," &s;aid the witty peer, <Q>if to your many vices you would add one more.</Q> <Q>Pray, my Lord, what is that?</Q> <Q>Hypocri&s;y, my dear Doc|tor.</Q> John&s;on had a younger brother named Nathaniel, who died at the age of twenty-&s;even or twenty-eight. Michael John&s;on, the father, was cho&s;en in the year 1718 Under Bailiff of Lichfield, and in the year 1725 he &s;erved the office of the Senior Bailiff. He had a brother of the name of Andrew, who, for &s;ome years, kept the ring at Smithfield, ap|propriated to wre&s;tlers and boxers. Our author u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he was never thrown or con|quered. Michael, the father, died December 1731, at the age of &s;eventy-&s;ix; his mother at eighty-nine, of a gradual decay, in the year 1759. Of the family nothing more can be related worthy of notice. John&s;on did not delight in talking of his relations. <Q>There is little plea&s;ure,</Q> he &s;aid to Mrs. Piozzi, <Q>in relating the anecdotes of beggary.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">John&s;on derived from his parents, or from an unwhole&s;ome nur&s;e, the di&s;temper called the King's Evil. The Jacobites at that time believed in the efficacy of the royal touch; and accordingly Mrs. John&s;on pre&s;ented her &s;on, when two years old, before Queen Anne, who, for the fir&s;t time, performed that office, and communicated to her young patient all the healing virtue in her power. He was after|wards cut for that &s;crophulous humour, and the under part of his face was &s;eamed and di&s;|figured by the operation. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that this di&s;ea&s;e deprived him of the &s;ight of his left eye, and al&s;o impaired his hearing. At eight years old, he was placed under Mr. Hawkins, at the Free-&s;chool at Lichfield, where he was not remarkable for diligence or regular application. Whatever he read, his tenacious memory made his own. In the fields with his &s;chool-fellows he talked more to him|&s;elf than with his companions. In 1725, when he was about &s;ixteen years old, he went on a vi&s;it to his cou&s;in Cornelius Ford, who detained him for &s;ome months, and in the mean time a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the cla&s;&s;ics. The
<PB N="9" REF="11">
general direction for his &s;tudies, which he then received, he related to Mrs. Piozzi. "Ob|tain," &s;ays Ford, <Q>&s;ome general principles of every &s;cience: he who can talk only on one &s;ubject, or act only in one department, is &s;eldom wanted, and, perhaps, never wi&s;hed for; while the man of general knowledge can often benefit, and always plea&s;e.</Q> This advice John&s;on &s;eems to have pur&s;ued with a good inclination. His reading was always de&s;ul|tory, &s;eldom re&s;ting on any particular author, but rambling from one book to another, and, by ha&s;ty &s;natches, hoarding up a variety of know|ledge. It may be proper in this place to men|tion another general rule laid down by Ford for John&s;on's future conduct: <Q>You will make your way the more ea&s;ily in the world, as you are contented to di&s;pute no man's claim to conver&s;ation-excellence: they will, therefore, more willingly allow your preten|&s;ions as a writer.</Q> "But," &s;ays Mrs. Pi|ozzi, <Q>the features of peculiarity, which mark a character to all &s;ucceeding generations, are &s;low in coming to their growth.</Q> That ingenious lady adds, with her u&s;ual vivacity, <Q>Can one, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, forbear recol|lecting
<PB N="10" REF="12">
the predictions of Boileau's father, who &s;aid, &s;troking the head of the young &s;atiri&s;t, 'this little man has too much wit, but he will never &s;peak ill of any one'?</Q></P>
<P>On John&s;on's return from Cornelius Ford, Mr. Hunter, then Ma&s;ter of the Free-&s;chool at Lichfield, refu&s;ed to receive him again on that foundation. At this di&s;tance of time, what his rea&s;ons were, it is vain to enquire; but to refu&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a lad of promi&s;ing genius mu&s;t be pronounced har&s;h and illiberal. It did not, however, &s;top the progre&s;s of the young &s;tudent's education. He was placed at another &s;chool, at Stourbridge in Worce&s;ter|&s;hire, under the care of Mr. Wentworth. Having gone through the rudiments of cla&s;&s;ic literature&punc; he returned to his father's hou&s;e, and was probably intended for the trade of a book&s;eller. He has been heard to &s;ay that he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind a book. At the end of two years, being than about nineteen, he went to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;tudies of a young gentleman, of the name of Corbet, to the Univer&s;ity of Oxford; and on the 31&s;t of October, 1728, both were entered of Pembroke College; Corbet as a gentleman-commoner,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
and John&s;on as a commoner. The college tutor, Mr. Jordan, was a man of no genius; and John&s;on, it &s;eems, &s;hewed an early contempt of mean abilities, in one or two in&s;tances behaving with in&s;olence to that gentleman. Of his general conduct at the univer&s;ity there are no particulars that merit attention, except the tran&s;lation of Pope's Me&s;&s;iah, which was a college exerci&s;e impo&s;ed upon him as a talk by Mr. Jordan. Corbet left the univer&s;ity in about two years, and John&s;on's &s;alary cea&s;ed. He was, by con&s;e|quence, &s;traitened in his circum&s;tances; but he &s;till remained at college. Mr. Jordan, the tutor, went off to a living; and was &s;ucceeded by Dr. Adams, who afterwards became head of the college, and was e&s;teemed through life for his learning, his talents, and his amiable cha|racter. John&s;on grew more regular in his attendance. Ethics, theology, and cla&s;&s;ic lite|rature, were his favourite &s;tudies. He di&s;co|vered, notwith&s;tanding, early &s;ymptoms of that wandering di&s;po&s;tion of mind which ad|hered to him to the end of his life. His read|ing was by &s;its and &s;tarts, undirected to any particular &s;cience. General philology, agree|ably
<PB N="12" REF="14">
to his cou&s;in Ford's advice, was the object of his ambition. He received, at that time, an early impre&s;&s;ion of piety, and a ta&s;te for the be&s;t authors ancient and modern. It may, notwith&s;tanding, be que&s;tioned whether, ex|cept his Bible, he ever read a book entirely through. Late in life, if any man prai&s;ed a book in his pre&s;ence, he was &s;ure to a&s;k, "Did you read it through?" If the an&s;wer was in the affirmative, he did not &s;eem willing to believe it. He continued at the univer&s;ity till the want of pecuniary &s;upplies obliged him to quit the place. He obtained, however, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend, and returning in a &s;hort time was able to complete a re&s;idence of three years. The hi&s;tory of his exploits at Oxford, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, was be&s;t known to Dr. Taylor and Dr. Adams. Wonders are told of his memory, and, indeed, all who knew him late in life can witne&s;s that he retained that fa|culty in the greate&s;t vigour.</P>
<P>From the univer&s;ity John&s;on returned to Lichfield. His father died &s;oon after, De|cember 1731; and the whole receipt out of his effects, as appeared by a memorandum in the
<PB N="13" REF="15">
&s;on's hand-writing, dated 15th June, 1732, was no more than twenty pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The entry of this is remarkable for his early re&s;olu|tion to pre&s;erve through life a fair and upright character. <Q>1732, Junii 15. Undecim aureos depo&s;ui, quo die, quid|quid ante matris &s;unus (quod &s;erum &s;it precor) de pa|ternis bonis &s;perare licet, viginti &s;cilicet libras, accepi. U&s;que adeo mihi mea fortuna &s;ingenda e&s;t interea, et ne paupertate vires animi langue&s;cant, ne in flagitia ege&s;tas adigat, cavendum.</Q></NOTE>. In this exigence, determined that poverty &s;hould nei|ther depre&s;s his &s;pirit nor warp his integrity, he became under-ma&s;ter of a Grammar-&s;chool at Market Bo&s;worth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. That re&s;ource, however, did not la&s;t long. Di&s;|gu&s;ted by the pride of Sir Wol&s;tan Dixie, the patron of that, little &s;eminary, he left the place in di&s;content, and ever after &s;poke of it with abhorrence. In 1733 he went on a vi&s;it to Mr. Hector, who had been his &s;chool|fellow, and was then a &s;urgeon at Birming|ham, lodging at the hou&s;e of Warren, a book&s;eller. At that place John&s;on tran&s;lated a Voyage to Aby&s;&s;inia, written by Jerome Lobo, a Portugueze mi&s;&s;ionary. This was the fir&s;t literary work from the pen of Dr. John|&s;on. His friend Hector was occa&s;ionally his
<PB N="14" REF="16">
amanuen&s;is. The work was, probably, un|dertaken at the de&s;ire of Warren, the book|&s;eller, and was printed at Birmingham; but it appears in the Literary Magazine, or Hi&s;tory of the Works of the Learned, for March, 1735. that it was published by Bette&s;worth and Hitch, Pater-no&s;ter-row. It contains a narrative of the endeavours of a company of mi&s;&s;ionaries to convert the people of Aby&s;&s;i|nia to the Church of Rome. In the preface to this work John&s;on ob&s;erves, <Q>that the Por|togue&s;e traveller, contrary to the general view of his countrymen, has amu&s;ed his readers with no romantic ab&s;urdities, or incredible fictions. He appears, by his mode&s;t and unaffected narration, to have de&s;cribed things as he &s;aw them; to have copied nature from the life; and to have consulted his &s;en&s;es, not his imagination. He meets with no ba&s;i|li&s;les, that de&s;troy with their eyes; his cro|codiles devour their prey, without tears; and his cataracts fall from the rock, without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants. The reader will here find no regions cur&s;ed with irremediable barrenne&s;s, or ble&s;&s;ed with &s;pon|taneous fecundity; no perpetual gloom, or
<PB N="15" REF="17">
uncea&s;ing &s;un-&s;hine; nor are the nations, here de&s;cribed, either void of all &s;en&s;e of huma|nity, or con&s;ummate in all private and &s;ocial virtues: here are no Hottentots without reli|gion, polity, or articulate language; no Chi|ne&s;e perfectly polite, and completely &s;killed in all &s;ciences: he will di&s;cover, what will always be di&s;covered by a diligent and impartial en|quirer, that wherever human nature is to be found, there is a mixture of vice and virtue, a conte&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion and rea&s;on; and that the Creator doth not appear partial in his di&s;tri|butions, but has balanced, in mo&s;t countries, their particular inconveniences by particular favours.</Q> We have here an early &s;pecimen of John&s;on's manner: the vein of thinking and the frame of the &s;entences are manife&s;tly his: we &s;ee the infant Hercules. The tran&s;|lation of Lobo's Narrative has been reprinted lately in a &s;eparate volume, with &s;ome other tracts of Dr. John&s;on's, and therefore forms no part of this edition; but a compendious account of &s;o intere&s;ting a work as Father Lobo's di&s;covery of the head of the Nile, will not, it is imagined, be unacceptable to the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">Father Lobo, the Portugue&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionary, embarked in 1622, in the &s;ame fleet with the Count <HI>Vidigueira,</HI> who was appointed, by the king of Portugal, Viceroy of the Indies. They arrived at Goa; and in January 1624, Father Lobo &s;et out on the mi&s;&s;ion to Aby&s;&s;inia. Two of the Je&s;uits, &s;ent on the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, were murdered in their attempt to penetrate into that empire. Lobo had better &s;ucce&s;s: he &s;urmounted all difficulties, and made his way into the heart of the country. Then fol|lows a de&s;cription of Aby&s;&s;inia, formerly the large&s;t empire of which we have an account in hi&s;tory. It extended from the Red Sea to the kingdom of Congo, and from Aegypt to the Indian Sea, containing no le&s;s than forty provinces. At the time of Lobo's mi&s;&s;ion, it was not much larger than Spain, con&s;i&s;ting then but of five kingdoms, of which part was entirely &s;ubject to the Emperor, and part paid him a tribute, as an acknowledgement. The provinces were inhabited by Moors, Pagans, Jews, and Chri&s;tians. The la&s;t was in Lobo's time the e&s;tabli&s;hed and reigning religion. The diver&s;ity of people and religion is the rea&s;on
<PB N="17" REF="19">
why the kingdom was under different forms of government, with laws and cu&s;toms extremely various. Some of the people neither &s;owed their lands, nor improved them by any kind of culture, living upon milk and fle&s;h, and, like the Arabs, encamping without any fettled ha|bitation. In &s;ome places they practi&s;ed no rites of wor&s;hip, though they believed that, in the regions above, there dwells a Being that governs the world. This Deity they call in their language <HI>Oul.</HI> The Christianity, pro|fe&s;&s;ed by the people in &s;ome parts, is &s;o cor|rupted with &s;uper&s;titions, errors, and here&s;ies, and &s;o mingled with ceremonies borrowed from the Jews, that little, be&s;ides the name of Chri&s;tianity, is to be found among them. The Aby&s;&s;ins cannot properly be &s;aid to have either cities or hou&s;es; they live in tents or cottages made of &s;traw or clay, very rarely building with &s;tone. Their villages or towns con&s;i&s;t of the&s;e huts; yet even of &s;uch villages they have but few, becau&s;e the grandees, the vice|roys, and the emperor him&s;elf, are always in camp, that they may be prepared, upon the mo&s;t &s;udden alarm, to meet every emergence in a country which is engaged every year either
<PB N="18" REF="20">
in foreign wars or inte&s;tine commotions. Ethi|opia produces very near the &s;ame kinds of pro|vi&s;ion as Portugal, though, by the extreme lazine&s;s of the inhabitants, in a much le&s;s quantity. What the ancients imagined of the torrid zone being a part of the world unin|habitable, is &s;o far from being true, that the climate is very temperate. The blacks have better features than in other countries, and are not without wit and ingenuity. Their appre|hen&s;ion is quick, and their judgement &s;ound. There are in this climate two harve&s;ts in the year; one in winter, which la&s;ts through the months of July, Augu&s;t, and September; the other in the &s;pring. They have, in the greate&s;t plenty, rai&s;ins, peaches, pomegranates, &s;ugar|canes, and &s;ome figs. Mo&s;t of the&s;e are ripe about Lent, which the Aby&s;&s;ins keep with great &s;trictne&s;s. The animals of the country are the lion, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the unicorn, hor&s;es, mules, oxen, and cows with|out number. They have a very particular cu&s;tom, which obliges every man, that has a thou&s;and cows, to &s;ave every year one day's milk of all his herd, and make a bath with it for his relations. This they do &s;o many days
<PB N="19" REF="21">
in each year, as they have thou&s;ands of cattle; &s;o that, to expre&s;s how rich a man is, they tell you, <HI>he bathes &s;o many times.</HI></P>
<P>Of the river Nile, which has furni&s;hed &s;o much controver&s;y, we have a full and clear de&s;cription. It is called by the natives, ABAVI, the Father of Water. It ri&s;es in SACALA, a province of the kingdom of GOIAMA, the mo&s;t fertile and agreeable part of the Aby&s;&s;inian dominions. On the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the coun|try, on the declivity of a mountain, who&s;e de&s;cent is &s;o ea&s;y, that it &s;eems a beautiful plain, is that &s;ource of the Nile, which has been &s;ought after at &s;o much expence and la|bour. This &s;pring, or rather the&s;e two &s;prings, are two holes, each about two feet diameter, a &s;tone's ca&s;t di&s;tant from each other. One of them is about five feet and a half in depth. Lobo was not able to &s;ink his plum|met lower, perhaps, becau&s;e it was &s;topped by roots, the whole place being full of trees. A line of ten feet did not reach the bottom of the other. The&s;e &s;prings are &s;uppo&s;ed by the Aby&s;&s;ins to be the vents of a great &s;ubterraneous lake. At a &s;mall di&s;tance
<PB N="20" REF="22">
to the South, is a village called <HI>Guix,</HI> through which you a&s;cend to the top of the mountain, where there is a little hill, which the idola|trous <HI>Agaci</HI> hold in great veneration. Their prie&s;t calls them together to this place once a year; and every one &s;acrifices a cow, or more, according to the different degrees of wealth and devotion. Hence we have &s;ufficient proof, that the&s;e nations always paid adoration to the Deity of this famous river.</P>
<P>"As to the cour&s;e of the Nile, its waters, after their fir&s;t ri&s;e, run towards the Ea&s;t, about the length of a mu&s;ket-&s;hot; then, turning Northward, continue hidden in the gra&s;s and weeds for about a quarter of a league, when they re-appear among&s;t a quantity of rocks. The Nile from its &s;ource proceeds with &s;o incon&s;iderable a current, that it is in danger of being dried up by the hot &s;ea&s;on; but &s;oon receiving an increa&s;e from the GEMMA, the KELTU, the BRANSA, and the other &s;maller rivers, it expands to &s;uch a breadth in the plains of BOAD, which is not above three days journey from its &s;ource, that a mu&s;ket-ball will &s;carcely fly from one bank to the other.
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Here it begins to run northward, winding, however, a little to the Ea&s;t, for the &s;pace of nine or ten leagues, and then enters the &s;o|much-talked-of Lake of DAMBIA, flowing with &s;uch violent rapidity, that its waters may be di&s;tingui&s;hed through the whole pa&s;|&s;age, which is no le&s;s than &s;ix leagues. Here begins the greatne&s;s of the Nile. Fifteen miles further, in the land of ALATA, it ru&s;hes precipitately from the top of a high rock, and forms one of the mo&s;t beautiful water-falls in the world. Lobo &s;ays, he pa&s;&s;ed under it without being wet, and re&s;ting him&s;elf, for the &s;ake of the coolne&s;s, was charmed with a thou&s;and delightful rainbows, which the &s;un-beams painted on the water, in all their &s;hining and lively colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Mr. Bruce, the late traveller, avers to be a downright fal&s;ehood. He &s;ays, a deep pool of water reaches to the very foot of the rock; and, allowing that there was a &s;eat or bench (which there is not) in the middle of the pool, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, by any exertion of human &s;trength, to have arrived at it. But it may be a&s;ked, can Mr. Bruce &s;ay what was the face of the country in the year 1622, when Lobo &s;aw the magnificent &s;ight, which he has de&s;cribed? Mr. Bruce's pool of water may have been formed &s;ince; and Lobo, perhaps, was content to &s;it down without a bench</NOTE>. The
<PB N="22" REF="24">
fall of this mighty &s;tream, from &s;o great a height, makes a noi&s;e that may be heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; but it was not found, that the neighbouring inhabitants were deaf. After the cataract, the Nile collects its &s;cattered &s;tream among the rocks, which are &s;o near each other, that, in Lobo's time, a bridge of beams, on which the whole imperial army pa&s;&s;ed, was laid over them. Sultan SEQUED has &s;ince built a &s;tone bridge of one arch, in the &s;ame place, for which purpo&s;e he procured ma&s;ons from India. Here the river alters its cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;es through various kingdoms, &s;uch as AMHARA, OLACA, CHOAA, DA|MOT, and the kingdom of GOIAMA, and, after various windings, returns within a &s;hort day's journey of its &s;pring. To pur&s;ue it through all its mazes, and accompany it round the kingdom of GOIAMA, is a journey of twenty-nine days. From Aby&s;&s;inia the river pa&s;&s;es into the countries of FAZULO and OM|BARCA. two va&s;t regions little known, inha|bited by nations entirely different from the Aby&s;&s;ins. Their hair, like that of the other blacks in tho&s;e regions, is &s;hort and curled. In the year 1615, RASSELA CHRISTOS, Lieu|tenant-general
<PB N="23" REF="25">
to Sultan SEQUED, entered tho&s;e kingdoms in a ho&s;tile manner; but, not being able to get intelligence, returned without at|tempting any thing. As the empire of Aby&s;&s;inia terminates at the&s;e de&s;cents, Lobo followed the cour&s;e of the Nile no farther, leaving it to range over barbarous kingdoms, and convey wealth and plenty into Aegypt, which owes to the annual inundations of this river its envied fertility <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After comparing this de&s;cription with that lately given by Mr. Bruce, the reader will judge whether Lobo is to lo&s;e the honour of having been at the head of the Nile near two centuries before any other European tra|veller.</NOTE>. Lobo knows no|thing of the Nile in the re&s;t of its pa&s;&s;age, except that it receives great increa&s;e from many other rivers, has &s;everal cataracts like that already de&s;cribed; and that few fi&s;h are to be found in it. That &s;carcity is to be attributed to the <HI>river-hor&s;e</HI> and the <HI>crocodile,</HI> which de|&s;troy the weaker inhabitants of the river. Something, likewi&s;e, mu&s;t be imputed to the <HI>cataracts,</HI> where fi&s;h cannot fall without being killed. Lobo adds, that neither he, nor any with whom he conver&s;ed about the <HI>crocodile,</HI> ever &s;aw him weep; and therefore all that
<PB N="24" REF="26">
hath been &s;aid about his tears mu&s;t be ranked among the fables invented for the amu&s;ement of children.</P>
<P>"As to the cau&s;es of the inundations of the Nile, Lobo ob&s;erves, that many an idle hypo|the&s;is has been framed. Some theori&s;ts a&s;cribe it to the high winds, that &s;top the current, and force the water above its banks. Others pretend a &s;ubterraneous communication be|tween the Ocean and the Nile, and that the &s;ea, when violently agitated, &s;wells the river. Many are of opinion, that this mighty flood proceeds from the melting of the &s;now on the mountains of Aethiopia; but &s;o much &s;now and &s;uch prodigious heat are never met with in the &s;ame region. Lobo never &s;aw &s;now in Aby&s;&s;inia, except on Mount SEMEN in the kingdom of TIGRE, very remote from the Nile; and on NAMARA, which is, indeed, not far di&s;tant, but where there never falls &s;now enough to wet, when di&s;&s;olved, the foot of the mountain. To the immen&s;e labours of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> mankind is indebted for the knowledge of the real cau&s;e of the&s;e inundations, &s;o great and &s;o regular. By them we are informed, that
<PB N="25" REF="27">
Aby&s;&s;inia, where the Nile ri&s;es, is full of mountains, and, in its natural &s;ituation, is much higher than Aegypt; that in the winter, from June to September, no day is without rain; that the Nile receives, in its cour&s;e, all the rivers, brooks, and torrents, that fall from tho&s;e mountains, and, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence, &s;welling above its banks, fills the plains of Aegypt with inundations, which come regularly about the month of July, or three weeks after the beginning of the rainy &s;ea&s;on in Aethiopia. The different degrees of this flood are &s;uch certain indications of the fruit|fulne&s;s or &s;terility of the en&s;uing year, that it is publickly proclaimed at <HI>Cairo</HI> how much the water hath gained during the night."</P>
<P>Such is the account of the Nile and its in|undations, which, it is hoped, will not be deemed an improper or tedious digre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pe|cially as the whole is an extract from John&s;on's tran&s;lation. He is all the time the actor in the &s;cene, and in his own words relates the &s;tory. Having fini&s;hed this work, he returned in Fe|bruary, 1734, to his native city, and, in the month of Augu&s;t following, publi&s;hed Pro|po&s;als
<PB N="26" REF="28">
for printing by &s;ub&s;cription, the Latin Poems of Politian, with the Hi&s;tory of Latin Poetry, from the Aera of Petrarch to the time of Politian; and al&s;o the Life of Politian, to be added by the Editor, Samuel John&s;on. The book to be printed in thirty octavo &s;heets, price five &s;hillings. It is to be regretted that this project failed for want of encouragement. John&s;on, it &s;eems, differed from Boileau, Vol|taire, and D'Alembert, who have taken upon them to pro&s;cribe all modern efforts to write with elegance in a dead language. For a deci|&s;ion, pronounced in &s;o high a tone, no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned. The intere&s;ts of learn|ing require, that the diction of Greece and Rome &s;hould be cultivated with care; and he who can write a language with correctne&s;s, will be mo&s;t likely to under&s;tand its idiom, its grammar, and its peculiar graces of &s;tyle. What man of ta&s;te would willingly forego the plea&s;ure of reading <HI>Vida, Fraca&s;torius, Sannazaro, Sirada,</HI> and others, down to the late elegant productions of Bi&s;hop Lowth? The hi&s;tory which John&s;on propo&s;ed to him|&s;elf would, beyond all que&s;tion, have been a valuable addition to the hi&s;tory of letters; but
<PB N="27" REF="29">
his project failed. His next expedient was to offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Cave, the original pro|jector of the Gentleman's Magazine. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent his propo&s;als in a letter, offering, on rea&s;onable terms, occa&s;ionally to fill &s;ome pages with poems and in&s;criptions never printed before; with fugitive pieces that de&s;erved to be revived, and critical remarks on authors ancient and modern. Cave agreed to retain him as a corre&s;pondent and contributor to the Magazine. What the conditions were cannot now be known; but, certainly, they were not &s;ufficient to hinder John&s;on from ca&s;t|ing his eyes about him in que&s;t of other em|ployment. Accordingly, in 1735, he made over|tures to the reverend Mr. Budworth, Ma&s;ter of a Grammar-&s;chool at Brerewood, in Stafford|&s;hire, to become his a&s;&s;i&s;tant. This propos;i|tion did not &s;ucceed. Mr. Budworth appre|hended, that the involuntary motions, to which John&s;on's nerves were &s;ubject, might make him an object of ridicule with his &s;cho|lars, and, by con&s;equence, le&s;&s;en their re&s;pect for their ma&s;ter. Another mode of advancing him&s;elf pre&s;ented it&s;elf about this time. Mrs. Porter, the widow of a mercer in Birmingham,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
admired his talents. It is &s;aid that &s;he had about eight hundred pounds; and that &s;um to a per&s;on in John&s;on's circum&s;tances was an affluent fortune. A marriage took place; and, to turn his wife's money to the be&s;t advantage, he projected the &s;cheme of an academy for education. Gilbert Walm&s;ley, at that time Regi&s;ter of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court of the Bi&s;hop of Lichfield, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his erudition and the politene&s;s of his manners. He was the friend of John&s;on, and, by his weight and influence, endeavoured to promote his intere&s;t. The celebrated Garrick, who&s;e father, Captain Garrick, lived at Lichfield, was placed in the new &s;eminary of education by that gentleman's advice. Garrick was then about eighteen years old. An acce&s;&s;ion of &s;e|ven or eight pupils was the mo&s;t that could be obtained, though notice was given by a public adverti&s;ement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Gentleman's Magazine for 1736, p. 418.</NOTE>, that at Edial, near Lich|field, in Stafford&s;hire, young Gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek Lan|guages, by Samuel John&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">The undertaking proved abortive. John|&s;on, having now abandoned all hopes of pro|moting his fortune in the country, determined to become an adventurer in the world at large. His young pupil, Garrick, had formed the &s;ame re&s;olution; and, accordingly, in March, 1737, they arrived in London together. Two &s;uch candidates for &s;ame perhaps never, before that day, entered the metropolis together. Their &s;tock of money was &s;oon exhaus&s;ted. In his vi&s;ionary project of an academy John&s;on had probably wa&s;ted his wife's &s;ub&s;tance; and Garrick's father had little more than his half-pay. The two fellow-travellers had the world before them, and each was to chu&s;e his road to fortune and to fame. They brought with them genius, and powers of mind, peculiarly formed by nature for the different vocations to which each of them felt him&s;elf inclined. They acted from the impul&s;e of young minds, even then meditating great things, and with courage anticipating &s;ucce&s;s. Their friend Mr. Walm&s;ley, by a letter to the Rev. Mr. Col&s;on, who, it &s;eems, was a great mathematician, exerted his good offices in their favour. He
<PB N="30" REF="32">
gave notice of their intended journey. <Q>Davy Garrick,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>will be with you next week; and John&s;on, to try his fate with a tragedy, and to get him&s;elf employed in &s;ome tran&s;lation either from the Latin or French. John&s;on is a very good &s;cholar and a poet, and, I have great hopes, will turn out a fine tragedy-writer. If it &s;hould be in your way, I doubt not but you will be ready to recommend and a&s;&s;i&s;t your countrymen.</Q> Of Mr. Walm&s;ley's merit, and the excellence of his character, John&s;on has left a beautiful te&s;timonial at the end of the Life of Edward Smith. It is rea&s;onable to conclude, that a mathematician, ab&s;orbed in ab&s;tract &s;pecula|tions, was not able to find a &s;phere of action for two men who were to be the architects of their own fortune. In three or four years after|wards Garrick came forth with talents that a&s;toni&s;hed the publick. He began his career at Goodman's-fields, and there, <HI>mon&s;tratus fatis Ve&s;pa&s;ianus!</HI> he cho&s;e a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently &s;oon emerged from all his difficulties. John&s;on was left to toil in the humble walks of literature. A tragedy, as appears by Walm&s;ley's letter, was the whole
<PB N="31" REF="33">
of his &s;tock. This, mo&s;t probably, was IRENE; but, if then fini&s;hed, it was doomed to wait for a more happy period. It was of|fered to Fleetwood, and rejected. John&s;on looked round him for employment. Having, while he remained in the country, corre&s;ponded with Cave under a feigned name, he now thought it time to make him&s;elf known to a man whom he con&s;idered as a patron of lite|rature. Cave had announced, by public adver|ti&s;ement, a prize of fifty pounds for the be&s;t Poem on Life, Death, Judgement, Heaven, and Hell; and this circum&s;tance diffu&s;ed an idea of his liberality. John&s;on became con|nected with him in bu&s;ine&s;s, and in a clo&s;e and intimate acquaintance. Of Cave's character it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing in this place, as John&s;on was afterwards the biographer of his fir&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful patron. To be en|gaged in the tran&s;lation of &s;ome important book was &s;till the object which John&s;on had in view. For this purpo&s;e he propo&s;ed to give the Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent, with copious notes then lately added to a French edition. Twelve &s;heets of this work were printed, for which John&s;on received forty-nine
<PB N="32" REF="34">
pounds, as appears by his receipt in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Nichols, the compiler of that entertaining and u&s;eful work, the Gentle|man's Magazine. John&s;on's tran&s;lation was never completed; a like de&s;ign was offered to the publick, under the patronage of Dr. Za|chary Pearce; and by that contention both attempts were fru&s;trated. John&s;on had been commended by Pope for the tran&s;lation of the Me&s;&s;iah into Latin ver&s;e; but he knew no approach to &s;o eminent a man. With one, however, who was connected with Pope, he became acquainted at St. John's Gate; and that per&s;on was no other than the well-known Richard Savage, who&s;e life was afterwards written by John&s;on with great elegance, and a depth of moral reflection. Savage was a man of con&s;iderable talents. His addre&s;s, his va|rious accompli&s;hments, and, above all, the peculiarity of his misfortunes recommended him to John&s;on's notice. They became united in the clo&s;e&s;t intimacy. Both had great parts, and they were equally under the pre&s;&s;ure of want. Sympathy joined them in a league of friend&s;hip. John&s;on has been often heard to relate; that he and Savage walked round Gro&s;ve|nor-&s;quare
<PB N="33" REF="35">
till four in the morning; in the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation reforming the world, dethroning princes, e&s;tabli&s;hing new forms of government, and giving laws to the &s;everal &s;tates of Europe, till, fatigued at length with their legi&s;lative office, they began to feel the want of refre&s;hment; but could not mu&s;ter up more than four pence halfpenny. Savage, it is true, had many vices; but vice could never &s;trike its roots in a mind like John&s;on's, &s;ea&s;oned early with religion, and the principles of moral rectitude. His fir&s;t prayer was com|po&s;ed in the year 1738. He had not at that time renounced the u&s;e of wine; and, no doubt, occa&s;ionally enjoyed his friend and his bottle. The love of late hours, which fol|lowed him through life, was, perhaps, origi|nally contracted in company with Savage. However that may be, their connection was not of long duration. In the year 1738, Sa|vage was reduced to the la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Mr. Pope, in a letter to him, expre&s;&s;ed his con|cern for <Q>the mi&s;erable withdrawing of his pen&s;ion after the death of the Queen;</Q> and gave him hopes that, <Q>in a &s;hort time, he &s;hould find him&s;elf &s;upplied with a compe|tence,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
without any dependance on tho&s;e little creatures, whom we are plea&s;ed to call the Great.</Q> The &s;cheme propo&s;ed to him was, that he &s;hould retire to Swan&s;ea in Wales, and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a year, to be rai&s;ed by &s;ub&s;cription; Pope was to pay twenty pounds. This plan, though finally e&s;tabli&s;hed, took more than a year be|fore it was carried into execution. In the mean time, the intended retreat of Savage called to John&s;on's mind the third &s;atire of Juvenal, in which that poet takes leave of a friend, who was withdrawing him&s;elf from all the vices of Rome. Struck with this idea, he wrote that well-known Poem, called London. The fir&s;t lines manife&s;tly point to Savage.</P>
<L>"Though grief and fondne&s;s in my brea&s;t rebel,</L>
<L>"When injured Thales bids the town farewell;</L>
<L>"Yet &s;till my calmer thoughts his choice com|mend;"</L>
<L>"I prai&s;e the hermit, but regret the friend.</L>
<L>"Re&s;erv'd at length from Vice and London far,</L>
<L>"To breathe in di&s;tant fields a purer air;</L>
<L>"And fix'd or Cambria's &s;olitary &s;hore,</L>
<L>"Give to St. David one true Briton more."</L>
<P>John&s;on at that time lodged at Greenwich. He there fixes the &s;cene, and takes leave of
<PB N="35" REF="37">
his friend; who, he &s;ays in his Life, parted from him with tears in his eyes. The poem, when fini&s;hed, was offered to Cave. It hap|pened, however, that the late Mr. Dod&s;ley was the purcha&s;er at the price of ten guineas. It was publi&s;hed 1738; and Pope, we are told, &s;aid, <Q>The author, whoever he is, will not be long concealed;</Q> alluding to the pa&s;|&s;age in Terence, <HI>Ubi, ubi e&s;t, diu celari non pote&s;t.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding that prediction, it does not appear that, be&s;ides the copy-money, any advantage accrued to the author of a poem, written with the elegance and energy of Pope. John&s;on, in Augu&s;t 1738, went, with all the &s;ame of his poetry, to offer him&s;elf a candi|date for the ma&s;ter&s;hip of the &s;chool at Ap|pleby, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. The &s;tatutes of the place required, that the per&s;on cho&s;en &s;hould be a ma&s;ter of arts. To remove this objec|tion, the late Lord Gower was induced to write to a friend, in order to obtain for John|&s;on a ma&s;ter's degree in the Univer&s;ity of Dub|lin, by the recommendation of Dr. Swift. The letter was printed in one of the maga|zines, and is as follows:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Samuel John&s;on (author of London, a &s;atire, and &s;ome other poetical pieces) is a native of this county, and much re&s;pected by &s;ome worthy gentlemen in the neigh|bourhood, who are tru&s;tees of a charity-&s;chool, now vacant; the certain &s;alary of which is &s;ixty pounds <HI>per</HI> year, of which they are de&s;irous to make him ma&s;ter; but unfortunately he is not capable of receiving their bounty, which would make him happy for life, by not being a ma&s;ter of arts, which, by the &s;tatutes of the &s;chool, the ma&s;ter of it mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e gentlemen do me the honour to think, that I have intere&s;t enough in you, to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift, to per&s;uade the Univer&s;ity of Dublin to &s;end a diploma to me, con&s;tituting this poor man ma&s;ter of arts in their Univer&s;ity. They highly extol the man's learning and probity; and will not be per&s;uaded, that the Univer&s;ity will make any difficulty of conferring &s;uch a favour upon a &s;tranger, if he is recom|mended by the Dean. They &s;ay, he is not

afraid of the &s;tricte&s;t examination, though he is of &s;o long a journey; and yet he will venture it, if the Dean thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, chu&s;ing rather to die upon the road, than to be &s;tarved to death in tran&s;lating for book|&s;ellers, which has been his only &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;ome time pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I fear there is more difficulty in this affair than the&s;e good-natured gentlemen appre|hend, e&s;pecially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the 11th of next month. If you &s;ee this matter in the &s;ame light that it appears to me, I hope you will burn this, and pardon me for giving you &s;o much trouble about an impracticable thing; but, if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour a&s;ked, I am &s;ure your humanity and propen&s;ity to relieve merit in di&s;tre&s;s will incline you to &s;erve the poor man, without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you, than a&s;&s;ur|ing you, that I am, with great truth, Sir,</P>

This &s;cheme mi&s;carried. There is rea&s;on to think, that Swift declined to meddle in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and to that circum&s;tance John&s;on's known di&s;like of Swift has been often im|puted.</P>
<P>It is mortifying to pur&s;ue a man of merit through all his difficulties; and yet this narra|tive mu&s;t be, through many following years, the hi&s;tory of Genius and Virtue &s;truggling with Adver&s;ity. Having lo&s;t the &s;chool at Appleby, John&s;on was thrown back on the metropolis. Bred to no profe&s;&s;ion, without relations, friends, or intere&s;t, he was con|demned to drudgery in the &s;ervice of Cave, his only patron. In November 1738 was pub|lished a tran&s;lation of Crou&s;az's Examen of Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man; <Q>containing a &s;uccinct View of the Sy&s;tem of the Fatali&s;ts, and a Confutation of their Opinions; with an Illu&s;tration of the Doctrine of Free Will; and an Enquiry, what view Mr. Pope might have in touching upon the Leibnitzian Phi|lo&s;ophy, and Fatali&s;m. By Mr. Crou&s;az, Profe&s;&s;or or Philo&s;ophy and Mathematics at Lau&s;anne.</Q> This tran&s;lation has been gene|rally
<PB N="39" REF="41">
thought a production of John&s;on's pen; but it is now known, that Mrs. Elizabeth Carter has acknowledged it to be one of her early per|formances. It is certain, however, that John&s;on was eager to promote the publication. He con&s;i|dered the foreign philo&s;opher as a man zealous in the cau&s;e of religion; and with him he was wil|ling to join again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem of the Fatali&s;ts, and the doctrine of Leibnitz. It is well known that Warburton wrote a vindication of Mr. Pope; but there is rea&s;on to think, that John&s;on conceived an early prejudice again&s;t the E&s;&s;ay on Man; and what once took root in a mind like his, was not ea&s;ily eradicated. His letter to Cave on this &s;ubject is &s;till extant, and may well ju&s;tify Sir John Hawkins, who inferred that John&s;on was the tran&s;lator of Crou&s;az. The conclu&s;ion of the letter is remarkable. <Q>I am yours, IMPRANSUS.</Q> If by that Latin word was meant that he had not dined, becau&s;e he wanted the means, who can read it, even at this hour, without an aching heart?</P>
<P>With a mind naturally vigorous, and quick|ened by nece&s;&s;ity, John&s;on formed a multipli|city of projects; but mo&s;t of them proved abortive. A number of &s;mall tracts i&s;&s;ued
<PB N="40" REF="42">
from his pen with wonderful rapidity; &s;uch as <Q>MARMOR NORFOLCIENSE; or an E&s;&s;ay on an ancient prophetical In&s;cription, in Monki&s;h Rhyme, di&s;covered at Lynn in Norfolk. By <HI>Probus Britannicus.</HI></Q> This was a pamphlet again&s;t Sir Robert Walpole. According to Sir John Hawkins, a warrant was i&s;&s;ued to apprehend the Author, who re|retired with his wife to an ob&s;cure lodging near Lambeth Mar&s;h, and there eluded the &s;earch or the me&s;&s;engers. But this &s;tory has no foundation in truth. John&s;on was never known to mention &s;uch an incident in his life; and Mr. Steele (late of the Trea&s;ury) cau&s;ed diligent &s;earch to be made at the proper offices, and no trace of &s;uch a proceeding could be found. In the &s;ame year (17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9) the Lord Chamberlain prohibited the repre&s;entation of a tragedy, called GUSTAVUS VASA, by Henry Brooke. Under the ma&s;k of irony John&s;on publi&s;hed, <Q>A Vindication of the Licencer from the malicious and &s;candalous A&s;per&s;ions of Mr. Brooke.</Q> Of the&s;e two pieces Sir John Hawkins &s;ays, <Q>they have neither learn|ing nor wit; nor a &s;ingle ray of that ge|nius which has &s;ince blazed forth;</Q> but as they have been lately re-printed, the reader,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
who wi&s;hes to gratify his curio&s;ity, is referred to the fourteenth volume of John&s;on's works, publi&s;hed by Stockdale. The lives of Boer|haave, Blake, Barratier, Father Paul, and others, were, about that time, printed in the Gentleman's Magazine. The &s;ub&s;cription of fifty pounds a year for Savage was completed; and in July, 1739, John&s;on parted with the companion of his midnight-hours, never to &s;ee him more. The &s;eparation was, perhaps, an advantage to him, who wanted to make a right u&s;e of his time, and even then beheld, with &s;elf-reproach, the wa&s;te occa&s;ioned by di&s;|&s;ipation. His ab&s;tinence from wine and &s;trong liquors began &s;oon after the departure of Sa|vage. What habits he contracted in the cour&s;e of that acquaintance cannot now be known. The ambition of excelling in conver&s;ation, and that pride of victory, which, at times, di&s;|graced a man of John&s;on's genius, were, per|haps, native blemi&s;hes. A fierce &s;pirit of in|dependence, even in the mid&s;t of poverty, may be &s;een in Savage; and, if not thence transfu&s;ed by John&s;on into his own manners, it may, at lea&s;t, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have gained &s;trength from the example before him. During that connection there was, if we believe Sir
<PB N="42" REF="44">
John Hawkins, a &s;hort &s;eparation between our author and his wife; but a reconciliation &s;oon took place. John&s;on loved her, and &s;hewed his affection in various modes of gallantry, which Garrick u&s;ed to render ridiculous by his mimicry. The affectation of &s;oft and fa&s;hionable airs did not become an unwieldy figure: his admiration was received by the wife with the &s;lutter of an antiquated coquette; and both, it is well known, furni&s;hed matter for the lively genius of Garrick.</P>
<P>It is a mortifying reflection, that John&s;on, with a &s;tore of learning and extraordinary ta|lents, was not able, at the age of thirty, to force his way to the favour of the publick. <HI>Slow ri&s;es worth by poverty depre&s;s'd.</HI> <Q>He was &s;till,</Q> as he &s;ays him&s;elf, <Q>to provide for the day that was pa&s;&s;ing over him.</Q> He &s;aw Cave involved in a &s;tate of warfare with the numerous competitors, at that time &s;trug|gling with the Gentleman's Magazine; and gratitude for &s;uch &s;upplies as John&s;on received, dictated a Latin Ode on the &s;ubject of that contention. The fir&s;t lines,
<Q><L>"Urbane, nullis fe&s;&s;e laboribus,</L>
<L>"Urbane. nullis victe calumniis,"</L></Q>
<PB N="43" REF="45">put one in mind of Ca&s;imir's Ode to Pope Urban:</P>
<Q><L>"Urbane, regum maxime, maxime</L>
<L>"Urbane vatum,"&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The Poli&s;h poet was, probably, at that time in the hands of a man who had meditated the hi&s;tory of the Latin poets. Guthrie the hi&s;|torian, had from July 1736 compo&s;ed the parliamentary &s;peeches for the Magazines; but, from the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion which opened on the 19th of November 1740, John&s;on &s;ucceeded to that department, and con|tinued it from that time to the debate on &s;pi|rituous liquors, which happened in the Hou&s;e of Lords in February, 1742-3. The elo|quence, the force of argument, and the &s;plen|dor of language, di&s;played in the &s;everal &s;peeches, are well known, and unive&s;ally ad|mired. The whole has been collected in two volumes by Mr. Stockdale, and may form a proper &s;upplement to this edition. That John|&s;on was the author of the debates during that period was not generally known; but the &s;e|cret tran&s;pired &s;everal years afterwards, and was avowed by him&s;elf on the following occa&s;ion. Mr. Wedderburne (now Lord Lough|borough),
<PB N="44" REF="46">
Dr. John&s;on, Dr. Francis (the tran&s;lator of Horace), the pre&s;ent writer, and others, dined with the late Mr. Foote. An important debate towards the end of Sir Ro|bert Walpole's admini&s;tration being mentioned, Dr. Francis ob&s;erved, <Q>That Mr. Pitt's &s;peech, on that occa&s;ion, was the be&s;t he had ever read.</Q> He added, <Q>That he had employed eight years of his life in the &s;tudy of De|mo&s;thenes, and fini&s;hed a tran&s;lation of that celebrated orator, with all the decorations of &s;tyle and language within the reach of his capacity; but he had met with nothing equal to the &s;peech above-mentioned.</Q> Many of the company remembered the debate; and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages were cited, with the approbation and applau&s;e of all pre&s;ent. During the ar|dour of conver&s;ation John&s;on remained &s;ilent. As &s;oon as the warmth of prai&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, he opened with the&s;e words. <Q>That &s;peech I wrote in a garret in Exeter-&s;treet.</Q> The company was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment. After &s;taring at each other in &s;ilent amaze, Dr. Fran|cis a&s;ked, <Q>How that &s;peech could be written by him?</Q> "Sir," &s;aid John&s;on, <Q>I wrote it in Exeter-&s;treet. I never had been in the
<PB N="45" REF="47">
gallery of the Hou&s;e of Commons but once. Cave had intere&s;t with the door-keepers. He, and the per&s;ons employed under him, gained admittance: they brought away the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the names of the &s;peakers, the &s;ide they took, and the order in which they ro&s;e, together with notes of the arguments advanced in the cour&s;e of the debate. The whole was afterwards commu|nicated to me, and I compo&s;ed the &s;peeches in the form which they now have in the Par|liamentary debates.</Q> To this di&s;covery Dr. Francis made an&s;wer: <Q>Then, Sir, you have exceeded Demo&s;thenes him&s;elf; for to &s;ay, that you have exceeded Francis's Demo&s;|thenes, would be &s;aying nothing.</Q> The re&s;t of the company be&s;towed lavi&s;h encomiums on John&s;on: one, in particular, prai&s;ed his im|partiality; ob&s;erving, that he dealt out rea&s;on and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties. That is not quite true, &s;aid John|&s;on<Q>; I &s;aved appearances tolerably well; but I took care that the <HI>WHIG DOGS</HI> &s;hould not have the be&s;t of it.</Q> The &s;ale of the Magazine was greatly increa&s;ed by the Parlia|mentary debates, which were continued by
<PB N="46" REF="48">
John&s;on till the month of March, 1742-3. From that time the Magazine was conducted by Dr. Hawke&s;worth.</P>
<P>In 1743-4, O&s;borne, the book&s;eller, who kept a &s;hop in Gray's-Inn, purcha&s;ed the Earl of Oxford's library, at the price of thirteen thou&s;and pounds. He projected a catalogue in five octavo volumes, at five &s;hillings each. John&s;on was employed in that painful drudgery. He was likewi&s;e to collect all &s;uch &s;mall tracts, as were in any degree worth pre&s;erving, in order to reprint and publi&s;h the whole in a collection, called "The Harleian Mi&s;cellany." The cata|logue was completed; and the Mi&s;cellany in 1749 was publi&s;hed in eight quarto volumes. In this bu&s;ine&s;s John&s;on was a day-labourer for immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, not unlike Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a working in the mines of Dalicarlia. What Wilcox, a book&s;eller of eminence in the Strand, &s;aid to John&s;on, on his fir&s;t arrival in town, was now almo&s;t confirmed. He lent our author five guineas, and then a&s;ked him, <Q>How do you mean to earn your livelihood in this town?</Q> "By my literary labours," was the an&s;wer. Wilcox, &s;taring at him, &s;hook
<PB N="47" REF="49">
his head: <Q>By your literary labours!&mdash;You had better buy a porter's knot.</Q> John&s;on u&s;ed to tell this anecdote to Mr. Nichols; but he &s;aid, <Q>Wilcox was one of my be&s;t friends, and he meant well.</Q> In fact, John&s;on, while employed in Gray's-Inn, may be &s;aid to have car|ried a porter's knot. He pau&s;ed occa&s;ionally, to peru&s;e the book that came to his hand. O&s;borne thought that &s;uch curio&s;ity tended to nothing but delay, and objected to it with all the pride and in&s;olence of a man, who knew that he paid daily wages. In the di&s;pute that of cour&s;e en&s;ued, O&s;borne, with that roughne&s;s which was natu|ral to him, enforced his argument by giving the lie. John&s;on &s;eized a folio, and knocked the book&s;eller down. This &s;tory has been related as an in&s;tance of John&s;on's ferocity; but merit cannot always take the &s;purns of the unworthy with a patient &s;pirit.</P>
<P>That the hi&s;tory of an author mu&s;t be found in his works is, in general, a true ob&s;ervation; and was never more apparent than in the pre|&s;ent narrative. Every aera of John&s;on's life is fixed by his writings. In 1744, he publi&s;hed the Life of Savage; and then projected a new
<PB N="48" REF="50">
edition of Shak&s;peare. As a prelude to this de&s;ign, he publi&s;hed, in 1745, <HI>Mi&s;cellaneous Ob&s;ervations on the Tragedy of Macbeth, with Remarks on Sir Thomas Hanmer's Edition; to which were prefixed, Propo&s;als for a new Edi|tion of Shak&s;peare, with a Specimen.</HI> Of this pamphlet Warburton, in the Preface to Shak|&s;peare, has given his opinion: <Q>As to all tho&s;e things, which have been publi&s;hed under the title of E&s;&s;ays, Remarks, Ob|&s;ervations, &amp;c. on Shak&s;peare, if you except &s;ome critical notes on <HI>Macbeth,</HI> given as a &s;pecimen of a projected edition, and written, as appears, by a man of parts and genius, the re&s;t are ab&s;olutely below a &s;erious notice.</Q> But the attention of the publick was not excited; there was no friend to promote a &s;ub&s;cription; and the project died, to revive at a future day. A new undertaking, however, was &s;oon after propo&s;ed; namely, an Engli&s;h Dictionary, upon an enlarged plan. Several of the mo&s;t opulent book&s;ellers had meditated a work of this kind; and the agree|ment was &s;oon adju&s;ted between the parties. Em|boldened by this connection, John&s;on thought of a better habitation than he had hitherto
<PB N="49" REF="51">
known. He had lodged with his wife in courts and alleys about the Strand; but now, for the purpo&s;e of carrying on his arduous undertaking, and to be near his printer and friend Mr. Strahan, he ventured to take a hou&s;e in Gough-&s;quare, Fleet-&s;treet. He was told that the Earl of Che&s;|terfield was a friend to his undertaking; and, in con&s;equence of that intelligence, he publi&s;hed, in 1747, <HI>The Plan of a Dictionary of the Engli&s;h Language, addr&s;&s;ed to the Right Honourable Philip Dormer, Earl of Che&s;terfield one of his Maje&s;ty's principal Secretaries of State.</HI> Mr. Whitehead, afterwards Poet Laureat, undertook to convey the manu&s;cript to his Lord&s;hip: the con&s;e|quence was an invitation from Lord Che&s;ter|field to the author. A &s;tronger contra&s;t of cha|racters could not be brought together; the Nobleman, celebrated for his wit, and all the graces of polite behaviour; the Author, con|&s;cious of his own merit, towering in idea above all competition ver&s;ed in &s;chola&s;tic logic, but a &s;tranger to the arts of polite con|ver&s;ation, uncouth, vehement, and vociferous. The coalition was too unnatural. John&s;on expected a Maecenas, and was di&s;appointed. No patronage, no a&s;i&s;tance followed. Vi&s;its
<PB N="50" REF="52">
were repeated; but the reception was not cor|dial. John&s;on one day was left a full hour, wait|ing in an anti-chamber till a gentleman &s;hould retire, and leave his Lord&s;hip at lei&s;ure. This was the famous Colley Cibber. John&s;on &s;aw him go, and, fired with indignation, ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e. What Lord Che&s;terfield thought of his vi&s;itor may be &s;een in a pa&s;&s;age in one of that Nobleman's letters to his &s;on. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter CCXII.</NOTE>. <Q>There is a man, who&s;e moral character, deep learn|ing, and &s;uperior parts, I acknowledge, ad|mire, and re&s;pect; but whom it is &s;o im|po&s;&s;ible for me to love, that I am almo&s;t in a fever whenever I am in his company. His figure (without being deformed) &s;eems made to di&s;grace or ridicule the common &s;tructure of the human body. His legs and arms are never in the po&s;ition which, according to the &s;ituation of his body, they ought to be in, but con&s;tantly employed in commit|ting acts of ho&s;tility upon the Graces. He throws any where, but down his throat, whatever he means to drink; and mangles what he means to carve. Inattentive to all the regards of &s;ocial life, he mi&s;times and
<PB N="51" REF="53">
mi&s;places every thing. He di&s;putes with heat indi&s;criminately, mindle&s;s of the rank, cha|racter, and &s;ituation of tho&s;e with whom he di&s;putes. Ab&s;olutely ignorant of the &s;everal gradations of familiarity and re&s;pect, he is exactly the &s;ame to his &s;uperiors, his equals, and his inferiors; and therefore, by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, is ab&s;urd to two of the three. Is it po&s;&s;ible to love &s;uch a man? No. The utmo&s;t I can do for him is, to con&s;ider him a re&s;pectable Hottentot.</Q> Such was the idea entertained by Lord Che&s;terfield. After the incident of Colley Cibber, John&s;on never repeated his vi&s;its. In his high and de|ci&s;ive tone, he has been often heard to &s;ay, <Q>Lord Che&s;terfield is a Wit among Lords, and a Lord among Wits.</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the year 1747, Garrick, in conjunction with Lacy, became patentee of Drury-lane Playhou&s;e. For the opening of the theatre, at the u&s;ual time, John&s;on wrote for his friend the well-known prologue, which, to &s;ay no more of it, may at lea&s;t be placed on a level with Pope's to the tragedy of Cato. The play-hou&s;e being now under Garrick's
<PB N="52" REF="54">
direction, John&s;on thought the opportunity fair to think of his tragedy of Irene, which was his whole &s;tock on his fir&s;t arrival in town, in the year 1737. That play was accordingly put into rehear&s;al in January 1749. As a pre|cur&s;or to prepare the way, and awaken the public attention, <HI>The Vanity of Human Wi&s;hes,</HI> a Poem in Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal, by the Author of <HI>London,</HI> was pub|li&s;hed in the &s;ame month. In the Gentleman's Magazine, for February, 1749, we find that the tragedy of <HI>Irene</HI> was acted at Drury-lane, on Monday, February the 6th, and from that time without interruption, to Monday, February the 20th, being in all thirteen nights. Since that time it has not been exhibited on any &s;tage. <HI>Irene</HI> may be added to &s;ome other plays in our language, which have lo&s;t their place in the theatre, but continue to plea&s;e in the clo&s;et. During the repre&s;entation of this piece, John&s;on attended every night behind the &s;cenes. Conceiving that his character, as an author, required &s;ome ornament for his per&s;on, he cho&s;e, upon that occa&s;ion, to de|corate him&s;elf with a hand&s;ome wai&s;tcoat, and a gold-laced hat. The late Mr. Topham Beau|clerc,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
who had had a great deal of that hu|mour which plea&s;es the more for &s;eeming unde&s;igned, u&s;ed to give a plea&s;ant de&s;cription of this Green-room finery, as related by the au|thor him&s;elf; "But," &s;aid John&s;on, with great gravity, <Q>I &s;oon laid a&s;ide my gold-laced hat, le&s;t it &s;hould make me proud.</Q> The amount of the three benefit nights for the tragedy of <HI>Irene,</HI> it is to be feared, was not very con&s;i|derable, as the profit, that &s;timulating motive, never invited the author to another dramatic attempt. Some years afterwards, when the pre&s;ent writer was intimate with Garrick, and knew John&s;on to be in di&s;tre&s;s, he a&s;ked the manager why he did not produce another tra|gedy for his Lichfield friend? Garrick's an&s;wer was remarkable: <Q>When John&s;on writes <HI>tragedy, declamation roars, and pa&s;&s;ion &s;leeps:</HI> when Shak&s;peare wrote, he dipped his pen in his own heart</Q></P>
<P>There may, perhaps, be a degree of &s;ame|ne&s;s in this regular way of tracing an author from one work to another, and the reader may feel the effect of a tedious monotony; but in the life of John&s;on there are no other land|marks.
<PB N="54" REF="56">
He was now forty years old, and had mixed but little with the world. He followed no profe&s;&s;ion, tran&s;acted no bu&s;ine&s;s, and was a &s;tranger to what is called a town-life. We are now arrived at the brighte&s;t period he had hitherto known. His name broke out upon mankind with a degree of lu&s;tre that promi&s;ed a triumph over all his difficulties. The Life of Savage was admired as a beautiful and in&s;truc|tive piece of biography. The two Imitations of Juvenal were thought to rival even the ex|cellence of Pope; and the tragedy of <HI>Irene,</HI> though unintere&s;ting on the &s;tage, was uni|ver&s;ally admired in the clo&s;et, for the propriety of the &s;entiments, the richne&s;s of the lan|guage, and the general harmony of the whole compo&s;ition. His fame was widely diffu&s;ed; and he had made his agreement with the book|&s;ellers for his Engli&s;h Dictionary at the &s;um of fifteen hundred guineas; part of which was to be, from time to time, advanced in proportion to the progre&s;s of the work. This was a cer|tain fund for his &s;upport, without being obliged to write fugitive pieces for the petty &s;upplies of the day. Accordingly we find that, in 1749, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a club, con&s;i&s;ting of ten in num|ber,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
at Hor&s;eman's, in Ivy-lane, on every Tue&s;day evening. This is the fir&s;t &s;cene of &s;ocial life to which John&s;on can be traced out of his own hou&s;e. The members of this little &s;ociety were, Samuel John&s;on; Dr. Salter (father of the late Ma&s;ter of the Charter-hou&s;e); Dr. Hawke&s;worth; Mr. Ryland, a merchant; Mr. Payne, a book&s;eller, in Pater|no&s;ter-row; Mr. Samuel Dyer, a learned young man; Dr. William M'Ghie, a Scotch phy&s;i|cian; Dr. Edmund Barker, a young phy&s;ician; Dr. Bathur&s;t, another young phy&s;ician; and Sir John Hawkins. This li&s;t is given by Sir John, as it &s;hould &s;eem, with no other view than to draw a &s;piteful and malevolent character of almo&s;t every one of them. Mr. Dyer, whom Sir John &s;ays he loved with the affec|tion of a brother, meets with the har&s;he&s;t treatment, becau&s;e it was his maxim, that <HI>to live in peace with mankind, and in a temper to do good offices, was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of our duty.</HI> That notion of moral goodne&s;s gave umbrage to Sir John Hawkins, and drew down upon the memory of his friend the bit|tere&s;t imputations. Mr. Dyer, however, was admired and loved through life. He was a
<PB N="56" REF="58">
man of literature. John&s;on loved to enter with him into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of metaphy&s;ical, moral, and critical &s;ubjects; in tho&s;e conflicts, exerci&s;ing his talents, and, according to his cu&s;tom, always contending for victory. Dr. Bathur&s;t was the per&s;on on whom John&s;on fixed his affection. He hardly ever &s;poke of him without tears in his eyes. It was from him, who was a native of Jamaica, that John&s;on received into his &s;ervice Frank, the black &s;ervant, whom, on account of his ma&s;ter, he valued to the end of his life. At the time of in&s;tituting the club in Ivy-lane, John&s;on had projected the <HI>Rambler.</HI> The title was mo&s;t probably &s;ugge&s;ted by the <HI>Wanderer;</HI> a poem which he mentions, with the warme&s;t prai&s;e, in the Life of Savage. With the &s;ame &s;pirit of independence with which he wi&s;hed to live, it was now his pride to write. He communi|cated his plan to none of his friends: he de|&s;ired no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, relying entirely on his own fund, and the protection of the Divine Being, which he implored in a &s;olemn form of prayer, compo&s;ed by him&s;elf for the occa&s;ion. Hav|ing formed a re&s;olution to undertake a work that might be of u&s;e and honour to his country,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
he thought, with Milton, that this was not to be obtained <Q>but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit that can enrich with all ut|terance and knowledge, and &s;end out his &s;eraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar, to touch and purify the lips of whom he plea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>Having invoked the &s;pecial protection of Heaven, and by that act of piety fortified his mind, he began the great work of the <HI>Ram|bler.</HI> The fir&s;t number was publi&s;hed on Tue&s;|day, March the 20th, 1750; and from that time was continued regularly every Tue&s;day and Saturday for the &s;pace of two years, when it finally clo&s;ed on Saturday, March 14, 1752. As it began with motives of piety, &s;o it ap|pears, that the &s;ame religious &s;pirit glowed with unabating ardour to the la&s;t. His con|clu&s;ion is: <Q>The E&s;&s;ays profe&s;&s;edly &s;erious, if I have been able to execute my own inten|tions, will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, without any accommodation to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and le|vity of the pre&s;ent age. I therefore look back on this part of my work with plea&s;ure,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
which no man &s;hall dimini&s;h or augment. I &s;hall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cau&s;e, if I can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue, and confidence to truth.</Q> The whole number of E&s;&s;ays amounted to two hundred and eight. Addi|&s;on's, in the Spectator, are more in number, but not half in point of quantity: Addi&s;on was not bound to publi&s;h on &s;tated days; he could watch the ebb and flow of his genius, and &s;end his pa|per to the pre&s;s when his own ta&s;te was &s;ati&s;|fied. John&s;on's ca&s;e was very different. He wrote &s;ingly and alone. In the whole progre&s;s of the work he did not receive more than ten e&s;&s;ays. This was a &s;canty contribution. For the re&s;t, the author has de&s;cribed his fituation: <Q>He that condemns him&s;elf to compo&s;e on a &s;tated day, will often bring to his ta&s;k an at|tention di&s;&s;ipated, a memory embarra&s;&s;ed, an imagination overwhelmed, a mind di&s;tracted with anxieties, a body langui&s;hing with di&s;|ea&s;e: he will labour on a barren topic, till it is too late to change it; or, in the ardour of invention, diffu&s;e his thoughts into wild exu|berance, which the pre&s;&s;ing hour of publi|cation
<PB N="59" REF="61">
cannot &s;uffer judgement to examine or reduce.</Q> Of this excellent production the number &s;old on each day did not amount to five hundred: of cour&s;e the book&s;eller, who paid the author four guineas a week, did not carry on a &s;ucce&s;sful trade. His genero&s;ity and per|&s;everance de&s;erve to be commended; and hap|pily, when the collection appeared in volumes, were amply rewarded. John&s;on lived to &s;ee his labours flouri&s;h in a tenth edition. His po&s;terity, as an ingenious French writer has &s;aid on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, began in his life|time.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1750, &s;oon after the <HI>Rambler</HI> was &s;et on foot, John&s;on was induced by the arts of a vile impo&s;tor to lend his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, during a temporary delu&s;ion, to a fraud not to be paralleled in the annals of literature. One LAUDER, a native of Scotland, who had been a teacher in the Univer&s;ity of EDIN|BURGH, had conceived a mortal antipathy to the name and character of Milton. His rea&s;on was, becau&s;e the prayer of Pamela, in Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, was, as he &s;up|po&s;ed, maliciou&s;ly in&s;erted by the great poet in
<PB N="60" REF="62">
an edition of the Eikon Ba&s;ilike, in order to fix an imputation of impiety on the memory of the murdered king. Fired with re&s;entment, and willing to reap the profits of a gro&s;s im|po&s;ition, this man collected from &s;everal Latin poets, &s;uch as Ma&s;enius the Je&s;uit, Staphor&s;|tius a Dutch divine, Beza, and others, all &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as bore any kind of re&s;emblance to different places in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; and the&s;e he publi&s;hed, from time to time, in the Gentleman's Magazine, with occa&s;ional inter|polations of lines, which he him&s;elf tran&s;lated from Milton. The public credulity &s;wallowed all with eagerne&s;s; and Milton was &s;uppo&s;ed to be guilty of plagiari&s;m from inferior modern writers. The fraud &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that Lauder collected the whole into a volume, and adverti&s;ed it under the title of <Q><HI>An E&s;&s;ay on Milton's U&s;e and Imitation of the Moderns, in his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; dedicated to the Univer|&s;ities of Oxford and Cambridge.</HI></Q> While the book was in the pre&s;s, the proof-&s;heets were &s;hewn to John&s;on at the Ivy-lane Club, by Payne, the bookleller, who was one of the members. No man in that &s;ociety was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the authors from whom Lauder
<PB N="61" REF="63">
profe&s;&s;ed to make his extracts. The charge was believed, and the contriver of it found his way to John&s;on, who is repre&s;ented by Sir John Hawkins, not indeed as an accomplice in the fraud, but, through motives of malignity to Milton, delighting in the detection, and exulting that the poet's reputation would &s;uf|fer by the di&s;covery. More malice to a de|cea&s;ed friend cannot well be imagined. Haw|kins adds, <Q><HI>that he wi&s;hed well to the argu|ment, mu&s;t be inferred from the preface, which indubitably was written by him.</HI></Q> The preface, it is well known, was written by John&s;on, and for that rea&s;on is in&s;erted in this edition. But if John&s;on approved of the argument, it was no longer than while he believed it founded in truth. Let us advert to his own words in that very preface. <Q>Among the enquiries to which the ardour of critici&s;m has naturally given occa&s;ion, none is more ob&s;cure in it|&s;elf, or more worthy of rational curio&s;ity, than a retro&s;pection of the progre&s;s of this mighty genius in the con&s;truction of his work; a view of the fabric gradually ri&s;ing, perhaps from &s;mall beginnings, till its foun|dation re&s;ts in the centre, and its turrets
<PB N="62" REF="64">
&s;parkle in the &s;kies; to trace back the &s;truc|ture, through all its varieties, to the &s;impli|city of the fir&s;t plan; to find what was pro|jected, whence the &s;cheme was taken, how it was improved, by what a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was executed, and from what &s;tores the mate|rials were collected; whether its founder dug them from the quarries of nature, or demoli&s;hed other buildings to embelli&s;h his own.</Q> The&s;e were the motives that induced John&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t Lauder with a preface: and are not the&s;e the motives of a critic and a &s;cholar? What reader of ta&s;te, what man of real knowledge, would not think his time well employed in an enquiry &s;o curious, &s;o intere&s;t|ing, and in&s;tructive? If Lauder's facts were really true, who would not be glad, without the &s;male&s;t tincture of malevolence, to receive real information? It is painful to be thus obliged to vindicate a man who, in his heart, towered above the petty arts of fraud and im|po&s;ition, again&s;t an injudicious biographer, who undertook to be his editor, and the protector of his memory. Another writer, Dr. Towers, in an E&s;&s;ay on the Life and Character of Dr. John&s;on, &s;eems to countenance this calumny.
<PB N="63" REF="65">
He &s;ays, <HI>It can hardly be doubted, but that John&s;on's aver&s;ion to Milton's politics was the cau&s;e of that alacrity with which he joined with Lauder in his infamous attack on our great epic poet, and which induced him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that tran&s;action.</HI> The&s;e words would &s;eem to de|&s;cribe an accomplice, were they not immedi|ately followed by an expre&s;s declaration, that John&s;on was <HI>unacquainted with the impo&s;ture.</HI> Dr. Towers adds, <HI>It &s;eems to have been by way of making &s;ome compen&s;ation to the memory of Milton, for the &s;hare he had in the attack of Lauder, that John&s;on wrote the prologue, &s;poken by Garrick, at Drury-lane Theatre, 1750, on the performance of the Ma&s;que of Comus, for the benefit of Milton's grand-daughter.</HI> Dr. Towers is not free from prejudice; but, as Shak&s;peare has it, <Q>he begets a temperance, to give it &s;moothne&s;s.</Q> He is, therefore, entitled to a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate an&s;wer. When John&s;on wrote the prologue, it does appear that he was aware of the malignant artifices practi&s;ed by Lauder. In the po&s;t&s;cript to John&s;on's pre|face, a &s;ub&s;cription is propo&s;ed, for relieving the grand-daughter of the author of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t. Dr. Towers will agree that this &s;hews
<PB N="64" REF="66">
John&s;on's alacrity in doing good. That alacrity &s;hewed it&s;elf again in the letter printed in the European Magazine, January, 1785, and there &s;aid to have appeared originally in the General Adverti&s;er, 4th April, 1750, by which the publick were invited to embrace the oppor|tunity of paying a ju&s;t regard to the illu&s;trious dead, united with the plea&s;ure of doing good to the living. The letter adds, <Q>To a&s;&s;i&s;t in|du&s;trious indigence, &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;s, and debilitated by age, is a di&s;play of vir|tue, and an acqui&s;ition of happine&s;s and ho|nour. Whoever, therefore, would be thought capable of plea&s;ure in reading the works of our incomparable Milton, and not &s;o de&s;ti|tute of gratitude as to refu&s;e to lay out a trifle, in a rational and elegant entertain|ment, for the benefit of his living remains, for the exerci&s;e of their own virtue, the increa&s;e of their reputation, and the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good, &s;hould appear at Drury-lane Theatre, to-morrow, April 5, when COMUS will be performed for the bene|fit of Mrs. Elizabeth Fo&s;ter, grand-daughter to the author, and the only &s;urviving branch of his family. <HI>Nota bene,</HI> there will be a
<PB N="65" REF="67">
new prologue on the occa&s;ion, written by the author of Irene, and &s;poken by Mr. Garrick.</Q> The man, who had thus exerted him&s;elf to &s;erve the grand-daughter, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have entertained per&s;onal malice to the grand-father. It is true, that the ma|levolence of Lauder, as well as the impo&s;tures of Archibald Bower, were fully detected by the labours, in the cau&s;e of truth, of the Rev. Dr. Douglas, now Lord Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury.</P>

<P>But the pamphlet, entituled, <HI>Milton vindicated from the Charge of Plagiari&s;m brought again&s;t him by Mr. Lauder, and Lauder him&s;elf con|victed of &s;everal Forgeries and gro&s;s Impo&s;itions on the Publick.

Dr. Douglas &s;ays: <Q>It is to be hoped, nay, it is <HI>expected,</HI> that the elegant and nervous writer, who&s;e judicious &s;entiments and in|imitable &s;tyle point out the author of Lau|der's preface and po&s;t&s;cript, will no longer allow A MAN to <HI>plume him&s;elf with his fea|thers,</HI> who appears &s;o little to have de&s;erved
<PB N="66" REF="68">
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; an a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I am per|&s;uaded would never have been communi|cated, had there been the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of tho&s;e facts, which I have been the in&s;tru|ment of conveying to the world.</Q> We have here a contemporary te&s;timony to the in|tegrity of Dr. John&s;on throughout the whole of that vile tran&s;action. What was the con|&s;equence of the requi&s;ition made by Dr. Doug|las? John&s;on, who&s;e ruling pa&s;&s;ion may be &s;aid to be the love of truth, convinced Lauder, that it would be more for his intere&s;t to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, than to &s;tand forth the convicted champion of a lye; and for this purpo&s;e he drew up, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, a recantation in a Letter to the Rev. Mr. Douglas, which Lauder &s;igned, and publi&s;hed in the year 1751. That piece will remain a la&s;ting memorial of the abhorrence with which John&s;on beheld a violation of truth. Mr. Ni|chols, who&s;e attachment to his illu&s;trious friend was unwearied, &s;hewed him in 1780 a book, called <HI>Remarks on John&s;on's Life of Milton,</HI> in which the affair of Lauder was renewed with virulence, and a <HI>poetical &s;cale</HI> in the Lite|rary Magazine 1758 (when John&s;on had cea&s;ed to write in that collection) was urged as an
<PB N="67" REF="69">
additional proof of deliberate malice. He read the libellous pa&s;&s;age with attention, and in&s;tantly wrote on the margin: <Q>In the bu&s;ine&s;s of Lau|der I was deceived, partly by thinking the man too frantic to be fraudulent. Of the <HI>poetical &s;cale</HI> quoted from the Magazine I am not the author. I fancy it was put in after I had quitted that work; for I not only did not write it, but I do not remember it.</Q> As a critic and a &s;cholar, John&s;on was willing to receive what numbers at the time believed to be true information: when he found that the whole was a forgery, he renounced all con|nection with the author.</P>
<P>In March 1752, he felt a &s;evere &s;troke of affliction in the death of his wife. The la&s;t number of the Rambler, as already mentioned, was on the 14th of that month. The lo&s;s of Mrs. John&s;on was then approaching, and, pro|bably, was the cau&s;e that put an end to tho&s;e admirable periodical e&s;&s;ays. It appears that &s;he died on the 28th of March: in a memorandum, at the foot of the Prayers and Meditations, that is called her Dying Day. She was buried at Bromley, under the care of Dr. Hawke&s;|worth. John&s;on placed a Latin, in&s;cription on
<PB N="68" REF="70">
her tomb, in which he celebrated her beauty. With the &s;ingularity of his prayers for his decea&s;ed wife, from that time to the end of his days, the world is &s;ufficiently acquainted. On Ea&s;ter|day, 22d April, 1764, his memorandum &s;ays: <Q>Thought on Tetty, poor dear Tetty! with my eyes full. Went to Church. After &s;ermon I recommended Tetty in a prayer by her&s;elf; and my father, mother, brother, and Bathur&s;t, in another. I did it only once, &s;o far as it might be lawful for me.</Q> In a prayer. January 23, 1759, the day on which his mother was buried, he commends, as far as may be lawful, her &s;oul to God, im|ploring for her whatever is mo&s;t beneficial to her in her pre&s;ent &s;tate. In this habit he per|&s;ervered to the end of his days. The Rev. Mr. Strahan, the editor of the Prayers and Meditation, ob&s;erves, <Q>That John&s;on, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, prays that the Almighty may have had merry on his wife and Mr. Thrale: evidently &s;appo&s;ing their &s;entence to have been already pa&s;&s;ed in the Divine Mind; and, by con&s;equence, proving, that. he had no belief in a &s;tate of purgatory, and no rea&s;on for praying for the dead that could impeach the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ion as a
<PB N="69" REF="71">
Prote&s;tant.</Q> Mr. Strahan adds, <Q>That, in praying for the regretted tenants of the grave, John&s;on conformed to a practice which has been retained by many learned members of the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church, though the Liturgy no longer admits it. <HI>If where the tree &s;alleth, there it &s;hall be;</HI> if our &s;tate, at the clo&s;e of life, is to be the mea&s;ure of our final &s;entence, then prayers for the dead, being vi&s;ibly fruitle&s;s, can be regarded only as the vain oblations of &s;uper&s;tition. But of all &s;uper&s;titions this, perhaps, is one of the lea&s;t unamiable, and mo&s;t incident to a good mind. If our &s;en&s;ations of kindne&s;s be inten&s;e, tho&s;e, whom we have revered and loved, death cannot wholly &s;eclude from our concern. It is true, for the rea&s;on ju&s;t men|tioned, &s;uch evidences of our &s;urviving af|fection may be thought ill-judged; but &s;urely they are generous, and &s;ome natural tenderne&s;s is due even to a &s;uper&s;tition, which thus originates in piety and benevolence.</Q> The&s;e &s;entences, extracted from the Rev. Mr. Strahan's preface, if they are not a full ju&s;ti&s;ication, are, at lea&s;t, a beautiful apo|logy. It will not be improper to add what John&s;on him&s;elf has &s;aid on the &s;ubject. Being
<PB N="70" REF="72">
a&s;ked by Mr. Bo&s;well <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of John&s;on, Vol. I. p. 328.</NOTE>, what he thought of purgatory, as believed by the Roman Catho|lics? His an&s;wer was, <Q>It is a very harmle&s;s doctrine. They are of opinion, that the generality of mankind are neither &s;o ob&s;ti|nately wicked as to de&s;erve everla&s;ting pu|ni&s;hment; nor &s;o good as to merit being admitted into the &s;ociety of ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits; and, therefore, that God is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow a middle &s;tate, where they may be purified by certain degrees of &s;uffering. You &s;ee there is nothing unrea&s;onable in this; and if it be once e&s;tabli&s;hed that there are &s;ouls in purgatory, it is as proper to pray for them, as for our brethren of mankind, who are yet in this life.</Q> This was Dr. John&s;on's gue&s;s into futurity; and to gue&s;s is the utmo&s;t that man can do. <HI>Shadows, clouds, and darkne&s;s, re&s;t upon it.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. John&s;on left a daughter, Lucy Porter, by her fir&s;t hu&s;band. She had contracted a friend&s;hip with Mrs. Anne Williams, the daugh|ter of Zachary Williams, a phy&s;ician of emi|nence in South Wales, who had devoted more than thirty years of a long life to the &s;tudy of
<PB N="71" REF="73">
the longitude, and was thought to have made great advances towards that important di&s;co|very. His letters to Lord Halifax, and the Lords of the Admiralty, partly corrected and partly written by Dr. John&s;on, are &s;till extant in the hands of Mr. Nichols <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gentleman's Magazine for Nov. and Dec. 1787.</NOTE>. We there find Dr. Williams, in the eighty-third year of his age, &s;tating, that he had prepared an in|strument, which might be called an epitome or miniature of the terraqueous globe, &s;liew|ing, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tables con&s;tructed by him&s;elf, the variations of the magnetic needle, and a&s;certaining the longitude for the &s;afety of navigation. It appears that this &s;cheme had been referred to Sir I&s;aac Newton; but that great philo&s;opher excu&s;ing him&s;elf on account of his advanced age, all applications were u&s;ele&s;s till 1751, when the &s;ubject was referred, by order of Lord An&s;on, to Dr. Bradley, the celebrated profe&s;&s;or of a&s;ironomy. His report was unfavourable <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. for Dec. 1787, p. 1042.</NOTE>, though it allows that a con&s;iderable progre&s;s had been made. Dr. Williams, after all his la|bour and expence, died in a &s;hort time after, a melancholy in&s;tance of unrewarded merit.
<PB N="72" REF="74">
His daughter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed uncommon talents, and, though blind, had an alacrity of mind that made her conver&s;ation agreeable, and even de&s;irable. To relieve and appea&s;e me|lancholy reflections, John&s;on took her home to his hou&s;e in Gough-&s;quare. In 1755, Garrick gave her a benefit-play, which pro|duced two hundred pounds. In 1766, &s;he publi&s;hed, by &s;ub&s;cription, a quarto volume of Mi&s;cellanies, and incren&s;ed her little &s;tock to three hundred pounds. That fund, with John&s;on's protection, &s;upported her through the remainder of her life.</P>
<P>During the two years in which the Rambler was carried on, the Dictionary proceeded by &s;low degrees. In May 1752, having compo&s;ed a prayer preparatory to his return from tears and &s;orrow to the duties of life, he re&s;umed his grand de|&s;ign, and went on with vigour, giving, however, occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his friend Dr. Hawke&s;|worth in the Adventurer, which began &s;oon after the Rambler was laid a&s;ide. Some of the mo&s;t valuable e&s;&s;ays in that collection were from the pen of John&s;on. The Dictionary was completed towards the end of 1754; and, Cave being then no more, it was a mortification to the author of that noble addition to our
<PB N="73" REF="75">
language, that his old friend did not live to fee the triumph of his labours. In May 1755, that great work was publi&s;hed. John&s;on was de&s;irous that it &s;hould come from one who had obtained academical honours; and for that pur|po&s;e, his friend the Rev. Thomas Warton ob|tained for him, in the preceding month of February, a diploma for a matter's degree from the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. Garrick, on the publication of the Dictionary, wrote the fol|lowing lines.</P>
<Q><L>"Talk of war with a Briton, he 'll boldly advance,</L>
<L>"That one Engli&s;h &s;oldier can beat ten of France.</L>
<L>"Would we alter the boa&s;t from the &s;word to the "pen,</L>

<L><PB N="74" REF="76">"And John&s;on well arm'd. like a hero of yore,</L>

<P>It is, perhaps, needle&s;s to mention, that Forty was the number of the French Academy, at the time when their Dictionary was publi&s;hed to &s;ettle their language.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the winter preceding this grand publication, the late Earl of Che&s;ter|field gave two e&s;&s;ays in the periodical Paper, called THE WORLD, dated November 28, and December 5, 1754, to prepare the publick for &s;o important a work. The original plan, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to his Lord&s;hip in the year 1747, is there mentioned in terms of the highe&s;t prai&s;e; and this was under&s;tood, at the time, to be a courtly way of &s;oliciting a dedication of the Dictionary to him&s;elf. John&s;on treated this civility with di&s;dain. He &s;aid to Garrick and others, <Q>I have &s;ailed a long and painful voyage round the world of the Engli&s;h lan|gunge; and does he now &s;end out two cock-boats to tow me into harbour?</Q> He had &s;aid, in the la&s;t number of the Rambler, <Q>that, having laboured to maintain the dignity of virtue, I will not now degrade it by the meanne&s;s of dedication.</Q> Such a man, when

he had fini&s;hed his "Dictionary, not," as he &s;ays him&s;elf, <Q>in the &s;oft ob&s;curities of retire|ment, or under the &s;helter of academic bowers, but amid&s;t inconvenience and di&s;|traction, in &s;ickne&s;s and in &s;orrow, and without the patronage of the great,</Q> was not likely to be caught by the lure thrown out by Lord Che&s;terfield. He had in vain &s;ought the patronage of that nobleman; and his pride, exa&s;perated by di&s;appointment, drew from him the following letter, dated in the month of February, 1755.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the Earl of CHESTERFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have been lately informed, by the pro|prietors of the World, that two papers, in which my Dictionary is recommended to the publick, were written by your Lord&s;hip. To be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed is an honour which, being very little accu&s;tomed to favours from the great, I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to acknowledge.</P>
<P>When, upon &s;ome &s;light encouragement, I fir&s;t vi&s;ited your Lord&s;hip, I was overpow|ered, like the re&s;t of mankind, by the en|chantment
<PB N="76" REF="78">
of your addre&s;s, and could not forbear to wi&s;h. that I might boa&s;t my&s;elf <HI>le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre;</HI> that I might obtain that regard for which I &s;aw the world contending. But I found my attendance &s;o little encouraged, that neither pride, nor mode&s;ty, would &s;uffer me to con|tinue it. When I had once addre&s;&s;ed your Lord&s;hip in public, I had exhau&s;ted all the art of plea&s;ing, which a retired and un|courtly &s;cholar can po&s;&s;e&s;s. I had done all that I could; and no man is well plea&s;ed to have his all neglected, be it ever &s;o little.</P>
<P>Seven years, my Lord, have now pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I waited in your outward room, or was repul&s;ed from your door; during which time I have been pu&s;hing on my work through difficulties, of which it is u&s;ele&s;s to complain, and have brought it at la&s;t to the verge of publication, without one act of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, one word of encouragement, or one &s;mile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a patron before.</P>
<P>The Shepherd in Virgil grew acquainted with Love, and found him a native of the rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79">Is not a patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man &s;truggling for life in the water, and, when has he reached ground, encumbers him with help?

<P><PB N="78" REF="80">It is &s;aid, upon good authority, that John&s;on once received from Lord Che&s;terfield the &s;um of ten pounds. It were to be wi&s;hed that the &s;ecret had never tran&s;pired. It was mean to receive it, and meaner to give it. It may be imagined, that for John&s;on's ferocity, as it has been called, there was &s;ome foundation in his finances; and, as his Dictionary was brought to a conclu&s;ion that money was now to flow in upon him. The rever&s;e was the ca&s;e. For his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, during the progre&s;s of the work, he had received at different times the amount of his contract; and when his re|ceipts were produced to him at a tavern-dinner, given by the book&s;ellers, it appeared, that he had been paid a hundred pounds and upwards more than his due. The author of a book, called <HI>Lexiphanes,</HI> written by a Mr. Campbell, a Scotchman, and pur&s;er of a man of war, endeavoured to bla&s;t his laurels, but in vain. The world applauded, and John&s;on never re|plied. "Abu&s;e," he &s;aid, <Q>is often of &s;er|vice: there is nothing &s;o dangerous to an author as &s;ilence; his name, like a &s;huttle|cock, mu&s;t be beat backward and forward, or it falls to the ground.</Q> Lexiphanes pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="79" REF="81">
to be an imitation of the plea&s;ant man|ner of Lucian; but humour was not the talent of the writer of Lexiphanes. As Dryden &s;ays, "He had too much hor&s;e-play in his raillery."</P>
<P>It was in the &s;ummer 1754, that the pre&s;ent writer became acquainted with Dr. John&s;on. The cau&s;e of his fir&s;t vi&s;it is related by Mrs. Piozzi nearly in the following manner. <Q>Mr. Murphy being engaged in a periodical paper, the Gray's-Inn Journal, was at a friend's hou&s;e in the country, and, not being di&s;po&s;ed to lo&s;e plea&s;ure for bu&s;ine&s;s, wi&s;hed to con|tent his book&s;eller by &s;ome un&s;tudied e&s;&s;ay. He therefore took up a French <HI>Journal Lit&eacute;|raire,</HI> and tran&s;lating &s;omething he liked, &s;ent it away to town. Time, however, di&s;|covered that he tran&s;lated from the French a Rambler, which had been taken from the Engli&s;h without acknowledgement. Upon this di&s;covery Mr. Murphy thought it right to make his excu&s;es to Dr. John&s;on. He went next day, and found him covered with &s;oot, like a chimney-&s;weeper, in a little room, as if he had been acting Lungs in the Al|chymi&s;t, <HI>making aether.</HI> This being told by Mr. Murphy in company, 'Come, come,'
<PB N="80" REF="82">
&s;aid Dr. John&s;on, 'the &s;tory is black enough; but it was a happy day that brought you fir&s;t to my hou&s;e'.</Q> After this fir&s;t vi&s;it, the author of this narrative by degrees grew intimate with Dr. John&s;on. The fir&s;t &s;triking &s;entence, that he heard from him, was in a few days after the publication of Lord Boling|broke's po&s;thumous works. Mr. Garrick a&s;ked him, "If he had &s;een them?" <Q>Yes, I have &s;een them.</Q> <Q>What do you think of them?</Q> "Think of them!" He made a long pau&s;e, and then replied: <Q>Think of them! A &s;coundrel and a coward! A &s;coun|drel, who &s;pent his life in charging a gun again&s;t Chri&s;tianity; and a coward, who was afraid of hearing the report of his own gun; but left half a crown to a hungry Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death.</Q> His mind, at this time &s;trained and over-laboured by con&s;tant exertion, called for an interval of repo&s;e and indolence. But indolence was the time of danger: it was then that his &s;pirits, not employed abroad, turned with inward ho&s;tility again&s;t him&s;elf. His reflections on his own life and conduct were always &s;evere; and, wi&s;hing to be immaculate,
<PB N="81" REF="83">
he de&s;troyed his own peace by unnece&s;&s;ary &s;cru|ples. He tells us, that when he &s;urveyed his pa&s;t life, he di&s;covered nothing but a barren wa&s;te of time, with &s;ome di&s;orders of body, and di&s;tur|bances of mind, very near to madne&s;s. His life, he &s;ays, from his earlie&s;t years, was wa&s;ted in a morning bed; and his reigning &s;in was a gene|ral &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, to which he was always in|clined, and, in part of his life, almo&s;t com|pelled, by morbid melancholy, and wearine&s;s of mind. This was his con&s;titutional ma|lady, derived, perhaps, from his father, who was, at times, overca&s;t with a gloom that bor|dered on in&s;anity. When to this it is added, that John&s;on, about the age of twenty, drew up a de&s;cription of his infirmities, for Dr. Swinfen, at that time an eminent phy&s;ician in Stafford&s;hire; and received an an&s;wer to his letter, importing, that the &s;ymptoms indicated a future privation of rea&s;on; who can wonder that he was troubled with melancholy and de|jection of &s;pirit? An apprehen&s;ion of the wor&s;t calamity that can befal human nature hung over him all the re&s;t of his life, like the &s;word of the tyrant &s;u&s;pended over his gue&s;t. In his &s;ixtieth year he had a mind to write the hi&s;tory of his melancholy; but he de&s;i&s;ted, not know|ing
<PB N="82" REF="84">
whether it would not too much di&s;turb him. In a Latin poem, however, to which he has prefixed as a title, <GAP DESC="foreign">, he has left a picture, of him&s;elf, drawn with as much truth, and as firm a hand, as can be &s;een in the portraits of Hogarth or Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds. The learned reader will find the original poem in this volume, p. 178; and it is hoped, that a tran&s;lation, or rather imitation, of &s;o curious a piece will not be improper in this place.</P>

<P>Such is the picture for which Dr. John&s;on &s;at to him&s;elf. He gives the prominent fea|tures of his character; his la&s;&s;itude, his mor|bid

bid melancholy, his love of fame, his dejec|tion, his tavern-parties, and his wandering reveries, <HI>Vacuae mala &s;omnia mentis,</HI> about which &s;o much has been written; all are painted in miniature, but in vivid colours, by his own hand. His idea of writing more Dictionaries was not merely &s;aid in ver&s;e. Mr. Hamilton, who was at that time an eminent printer, and well acquainted with Dr. John|&s;on, remembers that he engaged in a Com|mercial Dictionary, and, as appears by the receipt; in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was paid his price for &s;everal &s;heets; but he &s;oon relinqui&s;hed the undertaking. It is probable, that he found him&s;elf not &s;uffiently ver&s;ed in that branch of knowledge.</P>
<P>He was again reduced to the expedient of &s;hort compo&s;itions for the &s;upply of the day.

</LETTER>
<P>In the margin of this letter there is a memo|randum in the&s;e words: <Q>March 16, 1756. Sent &s;ix guineas. Witne&s;s, Wm. Ri|chard&s;on.</Q> For the honour of an admired writer it is to be regretted, that we do not find a more liberal entry. To his friend in di&s;tre&s;s he &s;ent eight &s;hillings more than was wanted. Had an incident of this kind occurred in one of his Romances, Richard&s;on would have known how to grace his hero; but in ficti|tious &s;cenes genero&s;ity co&s;ts the writer no|thing.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">About this time John&s;on contributed &s;e|veral papers to a periodical Mi&s;cellany, called The VISITOR, from motives which are highly honourable to him, a compa&s;&s;ionate re|gard for the late Mr. Chri&s;topher Smart. The critici&s;m on Pope's Epitaphs appeared in that work. In a &s;hort time after, he became a re|viewer in the Literary Magazine, under the au&s;pices of the late Mr. Newbery, a man of a projecting head, good ta&s;te, and great in|du&s;try. This employment engro&s;&s;ed but little of John&s;on's time. He re&s;igned him&s;elf to indolence, took no exerci&s;e, ro&s;e about two, and then received the vi&s;its of his friends. Au|thors, long &s;ince forgotten, waited on him as their oracle, and he gave re&s;pon&s;es in the chair of critici&s;m. He li&s;tened to the complaints, the &s;chemes, and the hopes and fears of a crowd of inferior writers, "who," he &s;aid, in the words of Roger A&s;cham, <Q>lived, <HI>men know not how, and died ob&s;cure, men marked not when.</HI></Q> He believed, that he could give a better hi&s;tory of Grub-&s;treet than any man living. His hou&s;e was filled with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;itors till four or five in the evening. During the whole time he pre&s;ided at his tea|table,
<PB N="89" REF="91">
Tea was his favorite beverage; and, when the late Jonas Hanway pronounced his anathema again&s;t the u&s;e of tea, John&s;on ro&s;e in defence of his habitual practice, declaring him&s;elf <Q>in that article a hardened &s;inner, who had for years diluted his meals with the infu&s;ion of that fa&s;cinating plant; who&s;e tea-kettel had no time to cool; who with tea &s;olaced the midnight hour, and with tea welcomed the morning.</Q></P>
<P>The propo&s;al for a new edition of Shak|&s;peare, which had formerly mi&s;carried, was re&s;umed in the year 1756. The book|&s;ellers readily agreed to his terms, and &s;ub|&s;cription-tickets were i&s;&s;ued out. For under|taking this work, money, he confe&s;&s;ed, was the inciting motive. His friends exerted them|&s;elves to promote his intere&s;t; and, in the mean time, he engaged in a new periodical production called THE IDLER. The fir&s;t num|ber appeared on Saturday, April 15, 1758; and the la&s;t, April 5, 1760. The profits of this work, and the &s;ub&s;criptions for the new edition of Shak&s;peare, were the means by which he &s;upported him&s;elf for four or five
<PB N="90" REF="92">
years. In 1759 was publi&s;hed Ra&s;&s;elas, Prince of Aby&s;&s;inia. His tran&s;lation of Lobo's Voyage to Aby&s;&s;inia &s;eems to have pointed out that country for the &s;cene of action; and <HI>Ra&s;&s;ila Chri&s;tos,</HI> the General of <HI>Sultan Segued,</HI> men|tioned in that work, mo&s;t probably &s;ugge&s;ted the name of the prince. The author wanted to &s;et out on a journey to Lichfield, in order to pay the la&s;t offices of filial piety to his mother, who, at the age of ninety, was then near her di&s;&s;olution; but money was nece&s;&s;ary. Mr. John&s;ton, a book&s;eller who has long &s;ince left off bu&s;ine&s;s, gave one hundred pounds for the copy. With this &s;upply John&s;on &s;et out for Lichfield; but did not arrive in time to clo&s;e the eyes of a parent whom he loved. He at|tended the funeral, which, as appears among his memorandums, was on the 23d of Janu|ary, 1759.</P>
<P>John&s;on now found it nece&s;&s;ary to retrench Lis expences. He gave up his hou&s;e in Gough|&s;quare. Mrs. Williams went into lodgings. He retired to Gray's-Inn, and &s;oon removed to chambers in the Inner Temple-lane, where he lived in poverty, total idlene&s;s, and the pride of
<PB N="91" REF="93">
literature. <HI>Magni &s;tat nominis umbrd.</HI> Mr. Fitzherbert (the father of Lord St. Helen's, the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter at Madrid) a man di&s;tingui&s;hed through life for his benevo|lence and other amiable qualities, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he paid a morning vi&s;it to John|&s;on, intending from his chambers to &s;end a letter into the city; but, to his great &s;ur|prize, he found an author by profe&s;&s;ion with|out pen, ink, or paper. The pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury was al&s;o among tho&s;e who endea|voured, by con&s;tant attention, to &s;ooth the cares of a mind which he knew to be afflicted with gloomy apprehen&s;ions. At one of the parties made at his hou&s;e, Bo&s;covich, the Je|&s;uit, who had then lately introduced the New|tonian philo&s;ophy at Rome, and, after pub|li&s;hing an elegant Latin poem on the &s;ubject, was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, was one of the company invited to meet Dr. John|&s;on. The conver&s;ation at fir&s;t: was mo&s;tly in French. John&s;on, though thoroughly ver&s;ed in that language, and a profe&s;&s;ed admirer of Boileau and La Bruyere, did not under&s;tand its pronunciation, nor could he &s;peak it him|&s;elf with propriety. For the re&s;t of the even|ing the talk was in Latin. Bo&s;covich, had a
<PB N="92" REF="94">
ready current flow of that flim&s;y phra&s;eology with which a prie&s;t may travel through Italy, Spain, and Germany. John&s;on &s;corned what he called colloquial barbari&s;ms. It was his pride to &s;peak his be&s;t. He went on, after a little practice, with as much faci|lity as if it was his native tongue. One &s;en|tence this writer well remembers. Ob&s;erving that Fontinelle at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed the Newtonian philo&s;ophy, and embraced it afterwards, his words were: <HI>Fontinellus, ni fallor, in extrem&acirc; &s;enectute, fuit transfuga ad ca&s;tra Newtoniana.</HI></P>
<P>We have now traveled through that part of Dr. John&s;on's life which was a perpetual &s;trug|gle with difficulties. Halcyon days are now to open upon him. In the month of May 1762, his Maje&s;ty, to reward literary merit, &s;ignified his plea&s;ure to grant to John&s;on a pen&s;ion of three hundred pounds a year. The Earl of Bute was mini&s;ter. Lord Loughborongh, who, perhaps, was originally a mover in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, had authority to mention it. He was well acquainted with John&s;on; but, having heard much of his independent &s;pirit, and of the downfall of O&s;borne the book&s;eller, he did
<PB N="93" REF="95">
not know but his benevolence might be re|warded with a folio on his head. He de&s;ired the author of the&s;e memoirs to undertake the ta&s;k. This writer thought the opportunity of doing &s;o much good the mo&s;t happy incident in his life. He went, without delay, to the chambers in the Inner Temple-lane, which, in fact, were the abode of wretchedne&s;s. By &s;low and &s;tudied approaches the me&s;&s;age was di&s;clo&s;ed. John&s;on made a long pau&s;e: he a&s;ked if it was &s;eriou&s;ly intended? He fell into a profound meditation, and his own defi|nition of a pen&s;ioner occurred to him. He was told, <Q>That he, at lea&s;t, did not come within the definition.</Q> He de&s;ired to meet next day, and dine at the Mitre Ta|vern. At that meeting he gave up all his &s;cruples. On the following day Lord Loughborough conducted him to the Earl of Bute. The conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed was in the evening related to this writer by Dr. John&s;on. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's bounty, and thought him&s;elf the more highly ho|noured, as the favour was not be&s;towed on him for having dipped his pen in faction. "No, Sir," &s;aid Lord Bute, <Q>it is not offered
<PB N="94" REF="96">
to you for having dipped your pen in faction, nor with a de&s;ign that you ever &s;hould.</Q> Sir John Hawkins will have it, that, after this interview, John&s;on was often pre&s;&s;ed to wait on Lord Bute, but with a &s;ullen &s;pirit refu&s;ed to comply. However that be, John&s;on was ne|ver heard to utter a di&s;re&s;pectful word of that nobleman. The writer of this e&s;&s;ay remem|bers a circum&s;tance which may throw &s;ome light on this &s;ubject. The late Dr. Ro&s;e, of Chi&s;wick, whom John&s;on loved and re&s;pected, contended for the pre-eminence of the Scotch writers; and Fergu&s;on's book on Civil Society, then on the eve of publication, he &s;aid, would give the laurel to North Britain. <Q>Alas! what can he do upon that &s;ubject?</Q> &s;aid John|&s;on: <Q>Ari&s;totle, Polybius, Grotius, Puffen|dorf, and Burlemaqui, have reaped in that field before him.</Q> "He will treat it," &s;aid Dr. Ro&s;e, "in a new manner." <Q>A new manner! Buckinger had no hands, and he wrote his name with his toes at Charing|cro&s;s, for half a crown apiece; that was a new manner of writing!</Q> Dr. Ro&s;e re|plied, <Q>If that will not &s;atisfy you, I will name a writer, whom you mu&s;t allow to be

the be&s;t in the kingdom.</Q> "Who is that?" <Q>The Earl of Bute, when he wrote an order for your pen&s;ion.</Q> "There, Sir," &s;aid John|&s;on, <Q>you have me in the toil: to Lord Bute I mu&s;t allow whatever prai&s;e you may claim for him.</Q> Ingratitude was no part of John|&s;on's character.</P>
<P>Being now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a regular in|come, John&s;on left his chambers in the Tem|ple, and once more became ma&s;ter of a hou&s;e in John&s;on's-court, Fleet-&s;treet. Dr. Levet, his friend and phy&s;ician in ordinary, paid his daily vi&s;its with a&s;&s;iduity; made tea all the morning, talked what he had to &s;ay, and did not expect an an&s;wer. Mrs. Williams had her apartment in the hou&s;e, and entertained her benefactor with more enlarged conver&s;ation. Chemi&s;try was part of John&s;on's amu&s;ement. For this love of experimental philo&s;ophy, Sir John Hawkins thinks an apology nece&s;&s;ary. He tells us, with great gravity, that curio&s;ity was the only object in view; not an intention to grow &s;uddenly rich by the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, or the tran&s;mutation of metals. To en|large his circle, John&s;on once more had re|cour&s;e
<PB N="96" REF="98">
cour&s;e to a literary club. This was at the Turk's Head, in Gerrard-&s;treet, Soho, on every Tue&s;day evening through the year. The members were, be&s;ides him&s;elf, the right ho|nourable Edmund Burke, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Dr. Nugent, Dr. Gold&s;mith, the late Mr. Topham Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Mr. Cha|mier, Sir John Hawkins, and &s;ome others. John&s;on's affection for Sir Jo&s;hua was found|ed on a long acquaintance, and a thorough knowledge of the virtues and amiable quali|ties of that excellent arti&s;t. He delighted in the conver&s;ation of Mr. Burke. He met him for the fir&s;t time at Mr. Garrick's &s;everal years ago. On the next day he &s;aid, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e, Murphy, you are proud of your country|man. CUM TALIS SIT UTINAM NOSTER ESSET!</Q> From that time his con&s;tant ob|&s;ervation was, <Q>That a man of &s;en&s;e could not meet Mr. Burke by accident, under a gateway to avoid a &s;hower, without being convinced that he was the fir&s;t man in Eng|land.</Q> John&s;on felt not only kindne&s;s, but zeal and ardour for his friends. He did every thing in his power to advance the reputation of Dr. Gold&s;mith. He loved him, though he
<PB N="97" REF="99">
knew his failings, and particularly the leaven of envy which corroded the mind of that ele|gant writer, and made him impatient, without di&s;gui&s;e, of the prai&s;es be&s;towed on any per&s;on whatever. Of this infirmity, which marked Gold&s;mith's character, John&s;on gave a remark|able in&s;tance. It happened that he went with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds and Gold&s;mith to &s;ee the Fantoccini, which were exhibited &s;ome years ago in or near the Haymarket. They admired the curious mechani&s;m by which the puppets were made to walk the &s;tage, draw a chair to the table, &s;it down, write a letter, and per|form a variety of other actions with &s;uch dex|terity, that <HI>though Nature's journeymen made the men, they imitated humanity</HI> to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the &s;pectator. The entertainment being over, the three friends retired to a ta|vern. John&s;on and Sir Jo&s;hua talked with plea&s;ure of what they had &s;een; and &s;ays John&s;on, in a tone of admiration, <Q>How the little fellow brandi&s;hed his &s;pontoon!</Q> "There is nothing in it," replied Gold&s;mith, &s;tarting up with impatience; <Q>give me a &s;pon|toon; I can do it as well my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">Enjoying his amu&s;ements at his weekly club, and happy in a &s;tate of independence, John|&s;on gained in the year 1765 another re&s;ource, which contributed more than any thing el&s;e to exempt him from the &s;olicitudes of life. He was introduced to the late Mr. Thrale and his family. Mrs. Piozzi has related the fact, and it is therefore needle&s;s to repeat it in this place. The author of this narrative looks back to the &s;hare he had in that bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;elf-congratula|tion, &s;ince he knows the tenderne&s;s which from that time &s;oothed John&s;on's cares at Streatham, and prolonged a valuable life. The &s;ub&s;cri|bers to Shak&s;peare began to de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing the promi&s;ed edition. To acquit him|&s;elf of this obligation, he went to work un|willingly, but proceeded with vigour. In the month or October 1765, Shak&s;peare was pub|li&s;hed; and, in a &s;hort time after, the Uni|ver&s;ity of Dublin &s;ent over a diploma, in ho|nourable terms, creating him a Doctor of Laws. Oxford in eight or ten years afterwards followed the example; and till then John&s;on never a&s;&s;umed the title of Doctor. In 1766 his con&s;titution &s;eemed to be in a rapid decline,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
and that morbid melancholy, which often clouded his under&s;tanding, came upon him with a deeper gloom than ever. Mr. and Mrs. Thrale paid him a vi&s;it in this &s;ituation, and found him on his knees, with Dr. Delap, the rector of Lewes, in Su&s;&s;ex, be&s;eeching God to continue to him the u&s;e of his under&s;tand|ing. Mr. Thrale took him to his hou&s;e at Streatham; and John&s;on from that time be|came a con&s;tant re&s;ident in the family. He went occa&s;ionally to the club in Gerard-&s;treet; but his head quarters were fixed at Streatham. An apartment was fitted up for him, and the library was greatly enlarged. Parties were con&s;tantly invited from town; and John&s;on was every day at an elegant table, with &s;elect and poli&s;hed company. Whatever could be devi&s;ed by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale to promote the happi|ne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;h the health of their gue&s;t, was &s;tudiou&s;ly performed from that time to the end of Mr. Thrale's life. John&s;on accompa|nied the family in all their &s;ummer excur&s;ions to Brighthelm&s;tone, to Wales, and to Paris. It is but ju&s;tice to Mr. Thrale to &s;ay, that a more ingenuous frame of mind no man po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. His education at Oxford gave him the
<PB N="100" REF="102">
habits of a gentleman; his amiable temper recommended his conver&s;ation, and the good|ne&s;s of his heart made him a &s;incere friend. That he was the patron of John&s;on, is an ho|nour to his memory.</P>
<P>In petty di&s;putes with contemporary wri|ters, or the wits of the age, John&s;on was &s;el|dom entangled. A &s;ingle incident of that kind may not be unworthy of notice, &s;ince it happened with a man of great celebrity in his time. A number of friends dined with Gar|rick on a Chri&s;tmas day. Foote was then in Ireland. It was &s;aid at table, that the modern Ari&s;tophanes (&s;o Foote was called) had been hor&s;e-whipped by a Dublin apothecary, for mimicking him on the &s;tage. "I wonder," &s;aid Garrick, <Q>that any man &s;hould &s;hew &s;o much re&s;entment to Foote; he has a pa|tent for &s;uch liberties; nobody ever thought it <HI>worth his while</HI> to quarrel with him in London.</Q> "I am glad," &s;aid John&s;on, <Q>to find that the <HI>man is ri&s;ing in the world.</HI></Q> The expre&s;&s;ion was afterwards reported to Foote; who in return, gave out, that he would pro|duce
<PB N="101" REF="103">
the <HI>Caliban of literature</HI> on the &s;tage. Being informed of this de&s;ign, John&s;on &s;ent word to Foote, <Q>That the theatre being intended for the reformation of vice, he would &s;tep from the boxes on the &s;tage, and correct him be|fore the audience.</Q> Foote knew the intre|pidity of his antagoni&s;t, and abandoned the de&s;ign. No ill-will en&s;ued. John&s;on u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>That, for broad-faced mirth, Foote had not his equal.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on's fame excited the curio&s;ity of the King. His Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee a man of whom extraordinary things were &s;aid. Accordingly, the librarian at Buckingham-hou&s;e invited John&s;on to &s;ee that elegant collec|tion of books, at the &s;ame time giving a hint of what was intended. His Maje&s;ty entered the room; and, among other things, a&s;ked the author, <Q>If he meant to give the world any more of his compo&s;itions?</Q> John&s;on an&s;wered, <Q>That he thought he had writ|ten enough.</Q> <Q>And I &s;hould think &s;o too,</Q> replied his Maje&s;ty, <Q>if you had not written &s;o well.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">Though John&s;on thought he had written enough, his genius, even in &s;pite of bodily &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, could not lie &s;till. In 1770 we find him entering the li&s;ts as a political writer. The flame of di&s;cord that blazed throughout the nation on the expul&s;ion of Mr. Wilkes, and the final determination of the Hou&s;e of Commons; that Mr. Luttrell was duly elected by 206 votes again&s;t 1143, &s;pread a general &s;pirit of di&s;content. To allay the tumult, Dr. John&s;on publi&s;hed <HI>The Fal&s;e Alarm.</HI> Mrs, Piozzi informs us, <Q>That this pamphlet was written at her hou&s;e, between eight o'clock on Wedne&s;day night and twelve on Thur&s;|day night.</Q> This celerity has appeared wonderful to many, and &s;ome have doubted the truth. It may, however, be placed within the bounds of probability. John&s;on has ob|&s;erved that there are different methods of com|po&s;ition. Virgil was u&s;ed to pour out a great number of ver&s;es in the morning, and pa&s;s the day in retrenching the exuberances, and cor|recting inaccuracies; and it was Pope's cu&s;tom to write his fir&s;t thoughts in his fir&s;t words, and gradually to amplify, decorate, rectify, and
<PB N="103" REF="105">
refine them. Others employ at once memory and invention, and, with little intermediate u&s;e of the pen, form and poli&s;h large ma&s;&s;es by continued meditation, and write their produc|tions only, when, in their opinion, they have completed them. This la&s;t was John&s;on's method. He never took his pen in hand till he had well weighed his &s;ubject, and gra&s;ped in his mind the &s;entiments, the train of argu|ment, and the arrangement of the whole. As he often thought aloud, he had, perhaps, talked it over to him&s;elf. This may account for that rapidity with which, in general, he di&s;patched his &s;heets to the pre&s;s, without be|ing at the trouble of a fair copy. Whatever may be the logic or eloquence of <HI>The Fal&s;e Alarm,</HI> the Hou&s;e of Commons have &s;ince era&s;ed the re&s;olution from the Journals. But whether they have not left materials for a fu|ture controver&s;y may be made a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In 1771 he publi&s;hed another tract, on the &s;ubject: of FALKLAND ISLANDS. The de&s;ign was to &s;hew the impropriety of going to war with Spain for an i&s;land thrown a&s;ide from human u&s;e, &s;tormy in winter, and barren in
<PB N="104" REF="106">
&s;ummer. For this work it is apparent that mate|rials were furni&s;hed by direction of the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>At the approach of the general elec|tion in 1774, he wrote a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e, called THE PATRIOT, not with any vi&s;ible applica|tion to Mr. Wilkes; but to teach the people to reject the leaders of oppo&s;ition, who called them&s;elves patriots. In 1775 he undertook a pamphlet of more importance, namely, <HI>Taxa|tion; no Tyranny,</HI> in an&s;wer to the Re&s;olutions and Addre&s;s of the American Congre&s;s. The &s;cope of the argument was, that di&s;tant colo|nies, which had, in their a&s;&s;emblies, a legi&s;la|ture of their own, were, notwith&s;tanding, lia|ble to be taxed in a Briti&s;h Parliament, where they had neither peers in one hou&s;e, nor repre|&s;entatives in the other. He was of opinion, that this country was &s;trong enough to enforce obedience. "When an Engli&s;hman," he &s;ays, <Q>is told that the Americans &s;hoot up like the hydra, he naturally con&s;iders how the hydra was de&s;troyed</Q> The event has &s;hewn how much he and the mini&s;ter of that day were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107">The Account of the Tour to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland, which was undertaken in the autumn of 1773, in company with Mr. Bo&s;well, was not publi&s;hed till &s;ome time in the year 1775. This book has been variou&s;ly received; by &s;ome extolled for the elegance of the narrative, and the depth of ob&s;ervation on life and manners; by others, as much con|demned, as a work of avowed ho&s;tility to the Scotch nation. The prai&s;e was, beyond all que&s;|tion, fairly de&s;erved; and the cen&s;ure, on due examination, will appear ha&s;ty and ill-founded. That John&s;on entertained &s;ome prejudices again&s;t the Scotch, mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled. It is true, as Mr. Bo&s;well &s;ays, <Q><HI>that he thought their &s;ucce&s;s in England exceeded their pro|portion of real merit, and he could not but &s;ee in them that nationality which no liberal-minded Scot&s;man will deny.</HI></Q> The author of the&s;e memoirs well remembers, that John&s;on one day a&s;ked him, <Q>Have you ob&s;erved the difference between your own country impu|dence and Scotti&s;h impudence?</Q> The an|&s;wer being in the negative: <Q>Then I will tell you,</Q> &s;aid John&s;on. <Q>The impudence of
<PB N="106" REF="108">
an Iri&s;hman is the impudence of a fly, that buzzes about you, and you put it away, but it returns again, and flutters and teazes you. The impudence of a Scot&s;man is the impu|dence of a leech, that fixes and &s;ucks your blood.</Q> Upon another occa&s;ion, this writer went with him into the &s;hop of Davies the book&s;eller, in Ru&s;&s;el-&s;treet, Covent-garden. Da|vies came running to him almo&s;t out of breath with joy: <Q>The Scots gentleman is come, Sir; his principal wi&s;h is to &s;ee you; he is now in the back-parlour.</Q> <Q>Well, well, I'll &s;ee the gentleman,</Q> &s;aid John&s;on. He walked towards the room. Mr. Bo&s;well was the per&s;on. This writer followed with no &s;mall curio&s;ity. "I find," &s;aid Mr. Bo&s;well, <Q>that I am come to London at a bad time, when great popular prejudice has gone forth again&s;t us North Britons; but when I am talking to you, I am talking to a large and liberal mind, and you know that I cannot <HI>help coming from Scotland.</HI></Q> "Sir," &s;aid John&s;on, "no more can the re&s;t of your coun|trymen."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="109">He had other rea&s;ons that helped to alienate him from the natives of Scotland. Being a cordial well-wi&s;her to the constitution in Church and State, he did not think that Calvin and John Knox were proper founders of a national religion. He made, however, a wide di&s;tinc|tion between the Di&s;&s;enters of Scotland and the Separati&s;ts of England. To the former he imputed no di&s;affection, no want of loyalty. Their &s;oldiers and their officers had &s;hed their blood with zeal and courage in the &s;ervice of Great Britain; and the people, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, were content with their own e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of wor&s;hip, without wi&s;hing, in the pre&s;ent age, to give any disturbance to the Church of England. This he was at all times ready to admit; and therefore declared, that when|ever he found a Scotchman to whom an Eng|li&s;hman was as a Scotchman, that Scotchman &s;hould be as an Englishman to him. In this, &s;urely, there was no rancour, no malevolence. The Di&s;&s;enters on this &s;ide the Tweed appeared to him in a different light. Their religion, he frequently &s;aid, was too worldly, too political, too re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious. The doctrine of
<PB N="108" REF="110">
<HI>ca&s;hiering</HI> kings, and erecting on the ruins of the con&s;titution a new form of government, which lately i&s;&s;ued from their pulpits, he always thought was, under a calm di&s;gui&s;e, the principle that lay lurking in their hearts. He knew that a wild democracy had overturned King, Lords, and Commons; and that a &s;et of Republican Fanatics, who would not bow at the name of JESUS, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the livings and all the pari&s;hes in the kingdom. That tho&s;e &s;cenes of horror might never be renewed, was the ardent wi&s;h of Dr. John&s;on; and though he apprehended no danger from Scot|land, it is probable that his di&s;like of Cal|vini&s;m mingled &s;ometimes with his reflections on the natives of that country. The a&s;&s;ocia|tion of ideas could net be ea&s;ily broken; but it is well known that he loved and reflected many gentlemen from that part of the i&s;land. Dr. Robert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Scotland, and Dr. Beattie's E&s;&s;ays, were &s;ubjects of his con&s;tant prai&s;e. M. Bo&s;well, Dr. Ro&s;e of Chi&s;wick, Andrew Millar, Mr. Hamilton the printer, and the late Mr. Strahan, were among his mo&s;t inti|mate friends. Many others might be added to the li&s;t. He &s;corned to enter Scotland as a
<PB N="109" REF="111">
&s;py; though Hawkins, his biographer, and the profe&s;&s;ing defender of his fame, allowed him|&s;elf leave to repre&s;ent him in that ignoble cha|racter. He went into Scotland to &s;urvey men and manners. Antiquities, fo&s;&s;ils, and mine|rals, were not within his province. He did not vi&s;it that country to &s;ettle the &s;tation of Roman camps, or the &s;pot where Galgacus fought the la&s;t battle for public liberty. The people, their cu&s;toms, and the progre&s;s of literature, were his objects. The civilities which he received in the cour&s;e of his tour have been repaid with grateful acknowledge|ment, and, generally, with great elegance of expre&s;&s;ion. His crime is, that he found the country bare of trees, and he has &s;tated the fact. This, Mr. Bo&s;well, in his Tour to the Hebrides, has told us, was re&s;ented by his countrymen with anger inflamed to rancour; but he admits that there are few trees on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Scotland. Mr. Pennant, in his Tour, &s;ays, that in &s;ome parts of the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the country, he &s;aw &s;everal large plan|tations of pine planted by gentlemen near their &s;eats; and in this re&s;pect: &s;uch a laudable &s;pirit prevails, that, <HI>in another half century,</HI> it never

&s;hall be &s;aid, <Q><HI>To &s;py the nakedne&s;s of the land are you come.</HI></Q> John&s;on could not wait for that half century, and therefore mentioned things as he found them. If in any thing he has been mi&s;taken, he has made a fair apology in the la&s;t paragraph of his book, avowing with candour, <Q>That he may have been &s;ur|prized by modes of life, and appearances of nature, that are familiar to men of wider &s;urvey, and more varied conver&s;ation. No|velty and ignorance mu&s;t always be recipro|cal; and he is con&s;cious that his thoughts on national manners are the thoughts of one, who has &s;een but little.</Q></P>
<P>The Poems of O&s;&s;ian made a part of John|&s;on's enquiry during his re&s;idence in Scotland and the Hebrides. On his return to England, November 1773, a &s;torm &s;eemed to be gather|ing over his head; but the cloud never bur&s;t, and the thunder never fell. O&s;&s;ian, it is well known, was pre&s;ented to the publick as a tran|&s;lation from the <HI>Ear&s;e;</HI> but that this was a fraud, John&s;on declared without he&s;itation. "The <HI>Ear&s;e,"</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>was always oral only, and never a written language. The
<PB N="111" REF="113">
Welch and the Iri&s;h were more cultivated. In <HI>Ear&s;e</HI> there was not in the world a &s;ingle manu&s;cript a hundred years old. Martin, who in the la&s;t century publi&s;hed an Ac|count of the We&s;tern I&s;lands, mentions <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> but never <HI>Ear&s;e</HI> manu&s;cripts, to be found in the i&s;lands in his time. The bards could not read; if they could, they might probably have written. But the bard was a barbarian among barbarians, and, knowing nothing him&s;elf, lived with others that knew no more. If there is a manu&s;cript from which the tran&s;lation was made, in what age was it written, and where is it? If it was collected from oral recitation, it could only be in detached parts and &s;cattered frag|ments: the whole is too long to be remem|bered.</Q> Who put it together in its pre&s;ent form? For the&s;e, and &s;uch like rea&s;ons, John&s;on calls the whole an impo&s;ture. He adds, <Q>The editor, or author, never could &s;hew the original, nor can it be &s;hewn by any other. To revenge rea&s;onable incredulity, by re|fu&s;ing evidence, is a degree of in&s;olence with which the world is not yet acquainted;
<PB N="112" REF="114">
and &s;tubborn audacity is the la&s;t refuge of guilt.</Q> This rea&s;oning carries with it great weight. It rou&s;ed the re&s;entment of Mr. Macpher&s;on. He &s;ent a threatening letter to the author; and John&s;on an&s;wered him in the rough phra&s;e of &s;tern defiance. The two he|roes frowned at a di&s;tance, but never came to action.</P>
<P>In the year 1777, the misfortunes of Dr. Dodd excited his compa&s;&s;ion. He wrote a &s;peech for that unhappy man, when called up to receive judgement of death; be&s;ides two pe|titions, one to the King, and another to the Queen; and a &s;ermon to be preached by Dodd to the convicts in Newgate. It may appear trifling to add, that about the &s;ame time he wrote a prologue to the comedy of A Word to the Wi&s;e, written by <HI>Hugh Kelly.</HI> The play, &s;ome years before, had been damned by a party on the fir&s;t night. It was revived for the benefit of the author's widow. Mrs. Piozzi relates, that when John&s;on was rallied for the&s;e exertions, &s;o clo&s;e to one another, his an&s;wer was, <HI>When they come to me with a dying
<PB N="113" REF="115">
Par&s;on, and a dead Stay-maker, what can a man do?</HI> We come now to the la&s;t of his literary labours. At the reque&s;t of the Book&s;ellers he undertook the Lives of the Poets. The fir&s;t publication was in 1779, and the whole was compleated in 1781. In a memorandum of that year he &s;ays, &s;ome time in March he fini&s;hed the Lives of the Poets, which he wrote in his u&s;ual way, dilatorily and ha&s;tily, unwilling to work, yet working with vigour and ha&s;te. In another place, he hopes they are written in &s;uch a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety. That the hi&s;tory of &s;o many men, who, in their different degrees, made them&s;elves con|&s;picuous in their time, was not written recently after their deaths, &s;eems to be an omi&s;&s;ion that does no honour to the Republic of Letters. Their contemporaries in general looked on with calm indifference, and &s;uffered Wit and Genius to vani&s;h out of the world in total &s;ilence, un|regarded, and unlamented. Was there no friend to pay the tribute of a tear? No ju&s;t ob|&s;erver of life, to record the virtues of the de|cea&s;ed? Was even Envy &s;ilent? It &s;eemed to have been agreed, that if an author's works &s;urvived, the hi&s;tory of the man was to give no

moral le&s;&s;on to after-ages. If tradition told us that BEN JONSON went to the Devil Tavern; that SHAKSPEARE &s;tole deer, and held the &s;tir|rup at playhou&s;e doors; that DRYDEN fre|quented Button's Coffee-hou&s;e; curio&s;ity was lulled a&s;leep, and Biography forgot the be&s;t part of her function, which is to in&s;truct mankind by examples taken from the &s;chool of life. This ta&s;k remained for Dr. John&s;on, when years had rolled away; when the channels of information were, for the mo&s;t part, choaked up, and little remained be&s;ides doutful anec|dote, uncertain tradition, and vague report.</P>
<Q>"Nunc fitus informis premit et de&s;erta Vetu&s;tas."</Q>
<P>The value of Biography has been better un|der&s;tood in other ages, and in other countries. Tacitus informs us, that to record the lives and characters of illu&s;trious men was the practice of the Roman authors, in the early periods of the Republic. In France the example has been followed. <HI>Fontinells, D' Alembert,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Thomas,</HI> have left models in this kind of com|po&s;ition. They have <HI>embalmed</HI> the dead. But it is true, that they had incitements and ad|vantages,
<PB N="115" REF="117">
even at a di&s;tant day, which could not, by any diligence, be obtained by Dr. John&s;on. The wits of France had ample ma|terials. They lived in a nation of critics, who had at heart the honour done to their country by their Poets, their Heroes, and their Philo|&s;ophers. They had, be&s;ides, an <HI>Academy of Belles Lettres,</HI> where Genius was cultivated, re|fined, and encouraged. They had the tracts, the e&s;&s;ays, and di&s;&s;ertations, which remain in the memories of the Academy, and they had the &s;peeches of the &s;everal members, delivered at their fir&s;t admi&s;&s;ion to a &s;eat in that learned A&s;&s;embly. In tho&s;e &s;peeches the new Acade|mician did ample ju&s;tice to the memory of his predece&s;&s;or; and though his harangue was de|corated with the colours of eloquence, and was, for that rea&s;on, called panegyric, yet being pronounced before qualified judges, who knew the talents, the conduct, and morals of the decea&s;ed, the &s;peaker could not, with pro|priety, wander into the regions of fiction. The truth was known, before it was adorned. The Academy &s;aw the marble, before the arti&s;t poli&s;hed it. But this country has had no Aca|demy of Literature. The public mind, for cen|turies,
<PB N="116" REF="118">
has been engro&s;&s;ed by party and faction <HI>by the madne&s;s of many for the gain of a few;</HI> by civil wars, religious di&s;&s;entions, trade and com|merce, and the arts of accumulating wealth. Amid&s;t &s;uch attentions, who can wonder that cold prai&s;e has been often the only reward of merit? In this country Doctor Nathaniel Hodges, who, like the good bi&s;hop of Mar|&s;eilles, <HI>drew purer breath</HI> amid&s;t the contagion of the plague in London, and, during the whole time, continued in the city, admini&s;tering me|dical a&s;&s;i&s;tence, was &s;uffered, as John&s;on u&s;ed to relate with tears in his eyes, to die for debt in a gaol. In this country, the man who brought the New River to London was ruined by that noble project; and in this country Otway died for want on Tower Hill; Butler, the great author of Hudibras, who&s;e name can only die with the Engli&s;h language, was left to langui&s;h in poverty, the particulars of his life almo&s;t unknown, and &s;carcs a ve&s;tige of him left ex|cept his immortal poem. Had there been an Academy of Literature, the lives, at lea&s;t, of tho&s;e celebrated per&s;ons would have been writ|ten for the benefit of po&s;terity. Swift, it &s;eems, had the idea of &s;uch an in&s;titution, and pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="117" REF="119">
it to Lord Oxford; but Whig and Tory were more important objects. It is needle&s;s to di&s;&s;emble, that Dr. John&s;on, in the Life of Ro&s;common, talks of the inutility of &s;uch a project. "In this country," he &s;ays, <Q>an Academy could be expected to do but little. If an academician's place were profitable, it would be given by intere&s;t; if attendance were gratuitous, it would be rarely paid, and no man would endure the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t. Una|nimity is impo&s;&s;ible, and debate would &s;epa|rate the a&s;&s;embly.</Q> To this it may be &s;uf|ficient to an&s;wer, that the Royal Society has not been di&s;&s;olved by &s;ullen di&s;gu&s;t; and the modern Academy at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e has already performed much, and promi&s;es more. Una|nimity is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly. On the contrary, by difference of opinion, and colli&s;ion of &s;entiment, the cau&s;e of Literature would thrive and flouri&s;h. The true principles of critici&s;m, the &s;ecret of fine writing, the in|ve&s;tigation of antiquities, and other intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, might occa&s;ion a cla&s;h of opinions; but in that contention Truth would receive il|lu&s;tration, and the e&s;&s;ays of the &s;everal mem|bers would &s;upply the Memoirs of the Academy.
<PB N="118" REF="120">
But, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, <Q>&s;uppo&s;e the philo|logical decree made and promulgated, what would be its authority? In ab&s;olute govern|ment there is &s;ometimes a general reverence paid to all that has the &s;anction of power, the countenance of greatne&s;s. How little this is the &s;tate of our country needs not to be told. The edicts of an Engli&s;h academy would probably be read by many, only that they may be &s;ure to di&s;obey them. The pre|&s;ent manners of the nation would deride au|thority, and therefore nothing is left, but that every writer &s;hould criticize him&s;elf.</Q> This &s;urely is not conclu&s;ive. It is by the &s;tandard of the be&s;t writers that every man &s;ettles for him&s;elf his plan of legitimate compo&s;ition; and &s;ince the authority of &s;uperior genius is acknow|ledged, that authority, which the individual obtains, would not be le&s;&s;ened by an a&s;&s;ociation with others of di&s;tingui&s;hed ability. It may, therefore, be inferred, that an Academy of Li|terature would be an e&s;tabli&s;hment highly u&s;e|ful, and an honour to Literature. In &s;uch an in&s;titution profitable places would not be wanted. <HI>Vatis avarus haud facile e&s;t animus;</HI> and the mini&s;ter, who &s;hall find lei&s;ure from party
<PB N="119" REF="121">
and faction, to carry &s;uch a &s;cheme into execu|tion, will, in all probability, be re&s;pected by po&s;terity as the Maecenas of letters.</P>
<P>We now take leave of Dr. John&s;on as an author. Four volumes of his Lives of the Poets were publi&s;hed in 1778, and the work was completed in 1781. Should Biography fall again into di&s;u&s;e, there will not always be a John&s;on to look back through a century, and give a body of critical and moral in&s;truction. In April 1781, he lo&s;t his friend Mr. Thrale. His own words, in his diary, will be&s;t tell that melancholy event. <Q>On Wedne&s;day the 11th of April, was buried my dear friend Mr. Thrale, who died on Wedne&s;day the 4th, and with him were buried many of my hopes and plea&s;ures. About five, I think, on Wed|ne&s;day morning he expired. I felt almo&s;t the la&s;t flutter of his pul&s;e, and looked for the la&s;t time upon the face, that, for fifteen years before, had never been turned upon me but with re&s;pect and benignity. Farewel: may God, that delighteth in mercy, have <HI>had</HI> mercy on thee. I had con&s;tantly prayed for him before his death. The decea&s;e of him,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
from who&s;e friend&s;hip I had obtained many opportunities of amu&s;ement, and to whom I turned my thoughts as to a refuge from mi&s;|fortune, has left me heavy. But my bu&s;i|ne&s;s is with my&s;elf.</Q> From the clo&s;e of his la&s;t work, the malady, that per&s;ecuted him through life, came upon him with alarming &s;everity. and his con&s;titution declined apace. In 1782 his old friend <HI>Levet</HI> expired without warning and without a groan. Events like the&s;e reminded John&s;on of his own mortality. He continued his vi&s;its to Mrs. Thrale at Streatham, to the 7th day of October, 1782, when having fir&s;t: compo&s;ed a prayer for the happine&s;s of a family with whom he had for many years enjoyed the plea&s;ures and comforts of life, he removed to his own hou&s;e in town. He &s;ays he was up early in the morning, and read fortuitou&s;ly in the Go&s;pel, <HI>which was his parting u&s;e of the library.</HI> The merit of the fa|mily is manife&s;ted by the &s;en&s;e he had of it, and we &s;ee his heart overflowing with grati|tude. He leaves the place with regret, and <HI>ca&s;ts: a lingering look behind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">The few remaining occurrences may be &s;oon di&s;patched. In the month of June, 1783, John&s;on had a paralytic &s;troke, which affected his &s;peech only. He wrote to Dr. Taylor of We&s;t|min&s;ter; and to his friend Mr. Allen, the printer, who lived at the next door. Dr. Brockle&s;by arrived in a &s;hort time, and by his care, and that of Dr. Heberden, John&s;on &s;oon recovered. During his illne&s;s the writer of this narrative vi&s;ited him, and found him reading Dr. Wat|&s;on's Chemi&s;try. Articulating with difficulty, he &s;aid, <Q>From this book, he who knows nothing may learn a great deal;and he who knows, will be plea&s;ed to find his know|ledge recalled to his mind in a manner highly plea&s;ing.</Q> In the month of Augu&s;t he &s;et out for Lichfield, on a vi&s;it to Mrs. Lucy Porter, the daughter of his wife by her fir&s;t hu&s;band and in his way back paid his re&s;pects to Dr. Adams at Oxford. Mrs. Williams died at his hou&s;e in Bolt-court in the month of Sep|tember, during his ab&s;ence. This was another &s;hock to a mind like his, ever agitated by the thoughts of futurity. The contemplation of his own approaching end was con&s;tantly before his eyes; and the pro&s;pect of death, he declared,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
was terrible. For many years, when he was not di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the conver&s;ation going forward, whoever &s;at near his chair, might hear him repeating, from Shak&s;peare,</P>
<Q><L>Ay, but to die and go we know not where;</L>
<L>To lie in cold ob&s;truction and to rot;</L>
<L>This &s;en&s;ible warm motion to become</L>
<L>A kneaded clod, and the delighted &s;pirit</L>
<L>To bathe in fiery floods. &mdash;</L></Q>
<P>And from Milton,</P>
<Q><L>Who would lo&s;e,</L>
<L>For fear of pain, this intellectual being?</L></Q>
<P>By the death of Mrs. Williams he was left in the a &s;tate of de&s;titution, with nobody but Frank, his black &s;ervant, to &s;ooth his anxious moments. In November 1783 he was &s;well|ed from head to foot with a dro&s;y. Dr. Brockle&s;by, with that benevolence with which he always a&s;&s;i&s;ts his friends, paid his vi&s;its with a&s;&s;iduity. The medicines pre&s;cribed were &s;o efficacious, that in a few days, John&s;on, while he was offering up his prayers, was &s;ud|denly obliged to ri&s;e, and, in the cour&s;e of the day, di&s;charged twenty pints of water.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125">John&s;on, being ea&s;ed of his drop&s;y, began to entertain hopes that the vigour of his con&s;ti|tution was not entirely broken. For the &s;ake of conver&s;ing with his friends, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a conve&s;ation club, to meet on every Wed|ne&s;day evening; and, to &s;erve a man whom he had known in Mr. Thrale's hou&s;hold for many years, the place was fixed at his hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex &s;treet near the Temple. To an&s;wer the malignant remarks of Sir John Hawkins on this &s;ubject, were a wretched wa&s;te of time. Profe&s;&s;ing to be John&s;on's friend, that bio|grapher has rai&s;ed more objections to his charac|ter, than all the enemies of that excellent man. Sir John had a root of bitterne&s;s that <HI>put rancours in the ve&s;&s;el of his peace.</HI> Fielding, he &s;ays, was the inventor of a cant phra&s;e, <HI>Goodne&s;s of heart, which means little more than the virtue of a hor&s;e or a dog.</HI> He &s;hould have known that kind affetions are the e&s;&s;ence of virtue; they are the will of God implanted in our nature, to aid and &s;trengthen moral obligation; they incite to action; a &s;en&s;e of benevo|lence is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than a &s;en&s;e of duty, Good affections are an ornament not only to an author but to his writings. He who &s;hews
<PB N="124" REF="126">
him&s;elf upon a cold &s;cent for opportunities to bark and &s;narl throughout a volume of &s;ix hundred pages, may, if he will, pretend to moralize; but GOODNESS OF HEART, or, to u&s;e that politer phra&s;e, the <HI>virtue of a hor&s;e or a dog,</HI> would redound more to his honour. But Sir John is no more: our bu&s;ine&s;s is with John&s;on. The members of his club were re|&s;pectable for their rank, their talents, and their literature. They attended with punctuality till about Mid&s;ummer 1784, when, with &s;ome appearance of health, John&s;on went into Der|by&s;hire, and thence to Lichfield. While he was in that part of the world, his friends in town were labouring for his benefit. The air of a more &s;outhern climate they thought might prolong a valuable life. But a pen&s;ion of &pound; 300 a year was a &s;lender fund for a travel|ing valetudinarian, and it was not then known that he had &s;aved a moderate &s;um of money. Mr. Bo&s;well and Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds under|took to &s;olicit the patronage of the Chancellor. With Lord Thurlow, while he was at the bar, John&s;on was well acquainted. He was often heard to &s;ay, <Q>Thurlow is a man of &s;uch vigour of mind, that I never knew I was to
<PB N="125" REF="127">
meet him but&mdash;I was going to &s;ay, I was afraid, but that would not be true, for I never was afraid of any man; but I never knew that I was to meet Thurlow, but I knew I had &s;omething to encounter.</Q> The Chancellor undertook to recommend John&s;on's ca&s;e, but without &s;ucce&s;s. To protract if po&s;|&s;ible the days of a man, whom he re&s;pected, he offered to advance the &s;um of five hundred pounds. Being informed of this at Lichfield, John&s;on wrote the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>After a long and not inattentive ob&s;erva|tion of mankind, the genero&s;ity of your Lord&s;hip's offer rai&s;es in me not le&s;s wonder than gratitude.

But it has plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore me to &s;o great a mea&s;ure of health, that if I &s;hould now appropriate &s;o much of a fortune de&s;tined to do good, I could not e&s;cape from my&s;elf the charge of advancing a fal&s;e claim. My journey to the continent, though I once

thought it nece&s;&s;ary, was never much en|couraged by my phy&s;icians; and I was very de&s;irous that your Lord&s;hip &s;hould be told it by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds as an event very un|certain; for, if I grew much better, I &s;hould not be willing; if much wor&s;e, I &s;hould not be able to migrate. Your Lord&s;hip was fir&s;t &s;olicited without my knowledge; but when I was told that you were plea&s;ed to honour me with your patronage, I did not expect to hear of a refu&s;al; yet, as I have had no long time to brood hopes, and have not rioted in imaginary opulence, this cold reception has been &s;carce a di&s;appointment; and from your Lord&s;hip's kindne&s;s I have received a benefit which only men like you are able to be&s;tow. I &s;hall now live <HI>mihi carior,</HI> with a higher opinion of my own merit.</P>

<P><PB N="127" REF="129">We have in this in&s;tance the exertion of two congenial minds; one, with a generous impul&s;e relieving merit in di&s;tre&s;s, and the other, by gratitude and dignity of &s;entiment ri&s;ing to an equal elevation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, however, that greatne&s;s of mind is not confined to greatne&s;s of rank. Dr. Brockles|by was not content to a&s;&s;i&s;t with his medical art; he re&s;olved to <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> to his patient's <HI>mind,</HI> and <HI>pluck from his memory the &s;orrow</HI> which the late refu&s;al from a high quarter might occa&s;ion. To enable him to vi&s;it the &s;outh of France in pur&s;uit of health, he offered from his own funds an annuity of one hundred pounds, payable quarterly. This was a <HI>&s;weet oblivious antidote,</HI> but it was not accepted for the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned to the Chancellor. The propo&s;al, however, will do honour to Dr. Brockle&s;by, as long as liberal &s;entiment &s;hall be ranked among the &s;ocial virtues.</P>
<P>In the month of October, 1784, we find Dr. John&s;on corre&s;ponding with Mr. Nichols, the intelligent compiler of the Gentleman's Magazine, and, in the langour of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;till
<PB N="128" REF="130">
de&s;irous to contribute all in his power to the advancement of &s;cience and u&s;eful knowledge, He &s;ays, in a letter to that gentleman, dated Lichfield, October 20, that he &s;hould be glad to give &s;o &s;kilful a lover of Antiquities any in|formation. He adds, <Q>At A&s;hburne, where I had very little company, I had the luck to borrow Mr. Bowyer's Life, a book &s;o full of contemporary hi&s;tory, that a literary man mu&s;t find &s;ome of his old friends. I thought that I could now and then have told you &s;ome hints worth your notice: We perhaps may talk a life over. I hope we &s;hall be much together. You mu&s;t now be to me what you were before, and what dear Mr. Allen was be&s;ides. He was taken unexpect|edly away, but I think he was a very good man. I have made very little progre&s;s in re|covery. I am very weak, and very &s;leeple&s;s; but I live on and hope.</Q></P>
<P>In that languid condition, he arrived, on the 16th of November, at his hou&s;e in Bolt-court, there to end his days. He laboured with the drop&s;y and an a&s;thma. He was attended by Dr. Heberden, Dr. Warren, Dr. Brockle&s;by,

Dr. Butter, and Mr. Cruik&s;hank, the eminent &s;urgeon. Eternity pre&s;ented to his mind an aweful pro&s;pect, and, with as much virtue as perhaps ever is the lot of man, he &s;huddered at the thought of his di&s;&s;olution. His friends awakened the comfortable reflection of a well-&s;pent life; and, as his end drew near, they had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing him com|po&s;ed, and even chearful, in&s;omuch that he was able, in the cour&s;e of his re&s;tle&s;s nights, to make tran&s;lations of Greek epigrams from the Anthologia; and to compo&s;e a Latin epi|taph for his father, his mother, and his bro|ther Nathaniel. He meditated, at the &s;ame time, a Latin in&s;cription to the memory of Garrick, but his vigour was exhau&s;ted.</P>

<P><PB N="132" REF="134">On the morning of Dec. 7, Dr. John&s;on re|que&s;ted to &s;ee Mr. Nichols. A few days before, he had borrowed &s;ome of the early vo|lumes of the Magazine, with a profe&s;&s;ed inten|tion to point out the pieces which he had writ|ten in that collection. The books lay on the table, with many leaves doubled down, and in particular tho&s;e which contained his &s;hare in the Parliamentary Debates. Such was the good|ne&s;s of John&s;on's heart, that he then declared, that <Q>tho&s;e debates were the only parts  of his writings which gave him any com|punction; but that at the time he wrote them he had no conception that he was impo&s;ing upon the world, though they were frequently written from very &s;lender materials, and often from none at all, the mere coinage of his
<PB N="133" REF="135">own imagination.</Q> He added, <Q>that he never  wrote any part of his work with equal velo|city. Three columns of the Magazine in an hour,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>was no uncommon effort; which was fa&s;ter than mo&s;t per&s;ons could have tran&s;cribed that quantity. In one day in particular, and that not a very long one, he wrote twelve pages, more in quantity than ever he wrote at any other time, except in the Life of Savage, of which forty eight pages in octavo were the production of one long day, including a part of the night.</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, he a&s;ked, whether any of the family of Faden the printer were living. Being told that the geographer near Charing-cro&s;s was Faden's &s;on, he &s;aid, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q>I borrowed a guinea of his father near thirty years ago; be &s;o good as to take this, and pay it for me.</Q></P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to di&s;charge every duty, and every obligation, John&s;on recollected another debt of ten pounds, which he had borrowed from his friend Mr. Hamilton the printer, about twenty years before. He &s;ent the money to Mr. Ha|milton
<PB N="134" REF="136">
at his hou&s;e in Bedford Row, with an apology for the length of time. The Reverend Mr. Strahan was the bearer of the me&s;&s;age, about four or five days before John&s;on breathed his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Sa&s;tres (whom Dr. John&s;on e&s;teemed and mentioned in his will) entered the room during his illne&s;s. Dr. John&s;on, as &s;oon as he &s;aw him, &s;tretched forth his hand, and, in a tone of lamentation, called out, JAM MORI|TURUS! But the love of life was &s;till an active principle. Feeling him&s;elf &s;welled with the drop&s;y, he conceived that, by inci&s;ions in his legs, the water might be di&s;charged. Mr. Cruik&s;hank apprehended that a mortification, might be the con&s;equence; but, to appea&s;e a di&s;tempered fancy, he gently lanced the &s;urface. John&s;on cried out, <Q>Deeper, deeper; I want length of life, and you are afraid of giving me pain, which I do not value.</Q></P>
<P>On the 8th of December, the Reverend Mr. Strahan drew his will, by which, after a few le|gacies, the re&s;idue, amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds, was bequeathed to Frank, the

Black &s;ervant, formerly con&s;igned to the te&s;|tator by his friend Dr. Bathur&s;t.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of a death-bed is painful. Mr. Strahan informs us, that the &s;trength of reli|gion prevailed again&s;t the infirmity of nature; and his foreboding dread of the Divine Ju&s;tice &s;ub&s;ided into a pious tru&s;t and humble hope of mercy at the Throne of Grace. On Monday the 13th day of December (the la&s;t of his ex|i&s;tence on this &s;ide the grave), the de&s;ire of life returned with all its former vehemence. He &s;till imagined, that, by puncturing his legs relief might be obtained. At eight in the morn|ing he tried the experiment, but no water fol|lowed. In an hour or two after, he fell into a doze, and about &s;even in the evening, expired without a groan.</P>
<P>On the 20th of the month his remains, with due &s;olemnities, and a numerous attendance of his friends, were buried in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, near the foot of Shak&s;peare's monument, and clo&s;e to the grave of the late Mr. Garrick. The funeral &s;ervice was read by his friend Dr. Taylor.</P>
<P>A black marble over his grave has the fol|lowing in&s;cription:</P>

<P>If we now, look back, as from an eminence, to view the &s;cenes of life, and the literary la|bours in which Dr. John&s;on was engaged, we may be able to delineate the features of the man, and to form an e&s;timate of his genius.</P>
<P>As a man, Dr. John&s;on &s;tands di&s;played in open day light. Nothing remains undi&s;covered. Whatever he &s;aid is known; and without al|lowing him the u&s;ual privilege of hazarding &s;entiments, and advancing po&s;itions, for mere amu&s;ement, or the plea&s;ure of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, Cri|tici&s;m has endeavoured to make him an&s;werable for what, perhaps, he never &s;eriou&s;ly thought. His diary, which has been printed, di&s;covers &s;till more. We have before us the very heart or the man, with all his inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. And yet neither in the open paths of life, nor in his &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es, has any one vice been di&s;|covered. We &s;ee him reviewing every year of his life, and &s;everely cen&s;uring him&s;elf, for not keeping re&s;olutions, which morbid melancholy,

We &s;ee him for every little defect im|po&s;ing on him&s;elf voluntary penance, going through the day with only one cup of tea with|out milk, and to the la&s;t, amid&s;t paroxy&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions of illne&s;s, forming plans of &s;tudy and re&s;olutions to amend his life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ubject of voluntary penance &s;ee the Rambler, N^o CX.</NOTE> Many of his &s;cruples may be called weakne&s;&s;es; but they are the weakne&s;&s;es of a good, a pious, and mo&s;t; excellent man.</P>

<P>&s;ub&s;cription for Shak&s;peare, he took hold of her hand in the middle of dinner, and held it clo&s;e to his eye, wondering at the delicacy and the whitene&s;s, till with a &s;mile &s;he a&s;ked, <HI>Will he give it to me again when he has done with it?</HI> The exteriors of politene&s;s did not belong to John&s;on. Even that civility which proceeds, or ought to proceed, from the mind, was &s;ome|times violated. His morbid melancholy had an effect on his temper; his pa&s;&s;ions were ir|ritable; and the pride of &s;cience, as well as of a fierce independent &s;pirit, inflamed him on &s;ome occa&s;ions above all bounds of moderation. Though not in the &s;hade of academic bowers, he led a &s;chola&s;tic life; and the habit of pro|nouncing deci&s;ions to his friends and vi&s;itors gave him a dictatorial manner, which was much enforced by a voice naturally loud, and often over&s;tretched. Metaphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, moral theory, &s;y&s;tems of religion, and anec|dotes of literature, were his favourite topics. General hi&s;tory had little of his regard. Bio|graphy was his delight. <HI>The proper &s;tudy of mankind is man.</HI> Sooner than hear of the Punic war, he would be rude to the per&s;on that in|troduced the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="143">John&s;on was born a logician; one of tho&s;e, to whom only books of logic are &s;aid to be of u&s;e. In con&s;equence of his &s;kill in that art, he loved argumentation. No man thought more profoundly, nor with &s;uch acute di&s;cernment. A fallacy could not &s;tand before him: it was &s;ure to be refuted by &s;trength of rea&s;oning, and a preci&s;ion both in idea and expre&s;&s;ion almo&s;t unequalled. When he cho&s;e by apt illu&s;tration to place the argument of his adver&s;ary in a lu|dicrous light, one was almo&s;t inclined to think <HI>ridicule the te&s;t of truth.</HI> He was &s;urprized to be told, but it is certainly true, that, with great powers of mind, wit and humour were his &s;hining talents. That he often argued for the &s;ake of a triumph over his adver&s;ary, cannot be di&s;&s;embled. Dr. Ro&s;e, of Chi&s;wick, has been heard to tell of a friend of his, who thanked him for introducing him to Dr. John&s;on, as he had been convinced, in the cour&s;e of a long di&s;pute, that an opinion which he had embraced as a &s;ettled truth, was no better than a vulgar error. This being reported to John&s;on, "Nay," &s;aid he,<Q>do not let him be thankful, for he was right, and I was wrong.</Q> Like his uncle Andrew, in the ring at Smithfield, John&s;on,
<PB N="140" REF="144">
in a circle of di&s;putants, was determined <HI>neither to be thrown nor conquered.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all his piety, &s;elf-government, or the command of his pa&s;&s;ions in conver&s;ation, does not &s;eem to have been among his attainments. When|ever he thought the contention was for &s;upe|riority, he has been known to break out with violence, and even ferocity. When the fray was over, he generally &s;oftened into repent|ance, and, by conciliating mea&s;ures, took care that no animo&s;ity &s;hould be left rankling in the brea&s;t of his antagoni&s;t. Of this defect he &s;eems to have been con&s;cious. In a letter to Mrs. Thrale, he &s;ays,<Q>Poor Baretti! do not quarrel with him; to neglect him a little will be &s;ufficient. He means only to be frank and manly, and independent, and, per|haps, as you &s;ay, a little wi&s;e. To be &s;rank, he thinks, is to be cynical; and to be inde|pendent, is to be rude. Forgive him, deare&s;t lady, the rather, becau&s;e of his mi&s;behaviour I am afraid he learned part of me. I hope to &s;et him hereafter a better example.</Q> For his own intolerant and overbearing &s;pirit he apologized by ob&s;erving, that it had done &s;ome good: ob&s;cenity and impiety were re|pre&s;&s;ed in his company.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="145">It was late in life before he had the habit of mixing, otherwi&s;e than occa&s;ionally, with po|lite company. At Mr. Thrale's he &s;aw a con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of well-accompli&s;hed vi&s;itors. In that &s;ociety he began to wear off the rugged points of his own character. He &s;aw the ad|vantages of mutual civility, and endeavoured to profit by the models before him. He aimed at what has been called by Swift the <HI>le&s;&s;er mo|rals,</HI> and by Cicero <HI>minores virtutes.</HI> His en|deavour, though new and late, gave plea&s;ure to all his acquaintance. Men were glad to &s;ee that he was willing to be communicative on equal terms and reciprocal complacence. The time was then expected when he was to cea&s;e being what George Garrick, brother to the celebrated actor, called him the fir&s;t time he heard him conver&s;e, "A TREMENDOUS COMPANION." He certainly wi&s;hed to be po|lite, and even thought him&s;elf &s;o; but his civility &s;till retained &s;omething uncouth and har&s;h. His manners took a milder tone, but the endeavour was too palpably &s;een. He la|boured even in trifles. He was a giant gaining a <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> to lift a feather.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="146">It is ob&s;erved by the younger Pliny, that in the confines of virtue and great qualities there are generally vices of an oppo&s;ite nature. In Dr. John&s;on not one ingredient can take the name of vice. From his attainments in literature grew the pride of knowledge; and from his powers of rea&s;oning, the love of di&s;|putation and the vain-glory of &s;uperior vigour. His piety, in &s;ome in&s;tances, bordered on &s;u|per&s;tition. He was willing to believe in pre|ternatural agency, and thought it not more &s;trange that there &s;hould be evil &s;pirits than evil men. Even the que&s;tion about &s;econd &s;ight hold him in &s;u&s;pence. "Second &s;ight," Mr. Pennant tells us, <Q>is a power of &s;eeing images impre&s;&s;ed on the organs of &s;ight by the power of fancy, or on the fancy by the di&s;ordered &s;pirits operating on the mind. It is the faculty of &s;eeing &s;pectres or vi&s;ions, which repre&s;ent an event actually pa&s;&s;ing at a distance, or likely to happen at a future day. In 1771, a gentleman, the la&s;t who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this faculty, had a boat at &s;ea in a tempe&s;tuous night, and, being anxious for his freight, &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, and &s;aid his men would be drowned, for he had &s;een them pa&s;s before
<PB N="143" REF="147">
him with wet garments and dropping locks. The event corre&s;ponded with his di&s;ordered fancy. And thus,</Q> continues Mr. Pennant, <Q>a di&s;tempered imagination, clouded with anxiety, may make an impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pirits; as per&s;ons, re&s;tle&s;s and troubled with, indignation, &s;ee various forms and figures while they lie awake in bed.</Q> This is what Dr. John&s;on was not willing to reject. He wi&s;hed for &s;ome po&s;itive proof of communica|tions with another world. His benevolence embraced the whole race of man, and yet was tinctured with particular prejudices. He was plea&s;ed with the mini&s;ter in the I&s;le of Sky, and loved him &s;o much that he began to wi&s;h him not a Pre&s;byterian. To that body of Di&s;|&s;enters his zeal for the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church made him in &s;ome degree an adver&s;ary; and his at|tachment to a mixed and limited Monarchy led him to declare open war again&s;t what he called a &s;ullen Republican. He would rather prai&s;e a man of Oxford than of Cambridge. He di&s;|liked a Whig, and loved a Tory. The&s;e were the &s;hades of his character, which it has been the bu&s;ine&s;s of certain party-writers to repre|&s;ent in the darke&s;t colours.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="148">Since virtue, or moral goodne&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts in a ju&s;t conformity of our actions to the relations in which we &s;tand to the Supreme Being and to our fellow creatures, where &s;hall we find a man who has been, or endeavoured to be, more diligent in the di&s;charge of tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential duties? His fir&s;t prayer was compo&s;ed in 1738; he continued tho&s;e fervent ejaculations of piety to the end of his life. In his medita|tions we &s;ee him &s;crutinizing him&s;elf with &s;everity, and aiming at perfection unattainable by man. His duty to his neighbour con&s;i&s;ted in univer&s;al benevolence, and a con&s;tant aim at the production of happine&s;s. Who was more &s;incere and &s;teady in his friend&s;hips? It has been &s;aid that there was no real affection be|tween him and Garrick. On the part of the latter, there might be &s;ome corro&s;ions of jea|lou&s;y. The character of PROSPERO, in the Rambler, No. 200, was, beyond all que&s;tion, occa&s;ioned by Garrick's o&s;tentatious di&s;play of furniture and Dre&s;den china. It was &s;urely fair to take from this incident a hint for a moral e&s;&s;ay; and, though no more was in|tended, Garrick, we are told, remembered it with unea&s;ine&s;s. He was al&s;o hurt that his
<PB N="145" REF="149">
Lichfield friend did not think &s;o highly of his dramatic art as the re&s;t of the world. The fact was, John&s;on could not &s;ee the pa&s;|&s;ions as they ro&s;e and cha&s;ed one another in the varied features of that expre&s;&s;ive face; and by his own manner of reciting ver&s;es, which was wonderfully impre&s;&s;ive, he plainly &s;hewed that he thought there was too much of artifi|cial tone and mea&s;ured cadence in the decla|mation of the theatre. The pre&s;ent writer well remembers being in conver&s;ation with Dr. John&s;on near the &s;ide of the &s;cenes during the tragedy of King Lear: when Gar|rick came off the &s;tage, he &s;aid, <Q>You two talk, &s;o loud you de&s;troy all my feelings.</Q> "Prithee," replied John&s;on, <Q>do not talk of feelings, Punch has no feelings.</Q> This &s;eems to have been his &s;ettled opinion; admi|rable as Garrick's imitation of nature always was, John&s;on thought it no better than mere mimickry. Yet it is certain that he e&s;teemed and loved Garrick; that he dwelt with plea|&s;ure on his prai&s;e; and u&s;ed to declare, that he de&s;erved his great &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e on all applications for charity he gave more than was a&s;ked. After Garrick's death he never talked
<PB N="146" REF="150">
of him without a tear in his eyes. He offered, if Mrs. Garrick would de&s;ire it of him, to be the editor of his works and the hi&s;torian of his life. It has been mentioned that on his death-bed he thought of writing a Latin in&s;cription to the memory of his friend. Numbers are &s;till living who know the&s;e facts, and &s;ti11 re|member with gratitude the friend&s;hip which he &s;hewed to them with unaltered affection for a number of years. His humanity and genero&s;ity, in proportion to his &s;lender income, were unbounded. It has been truly &s;aid, that the lame, the blind, and the &s;orrowful, found in his hou&s;e a &s;ure retreat. A &s;trict adherence to truth he con&s;idered as a &s;acred obligation, in&s;omuch that, in relating the mo&s;t minute anecdote, he would not allow him&s;elf the &s;mall|e&s;t addition to embelli&s;h his &s;tory. The late Mr. Tyers, who knew Dr. John&s;on intimately, ob&s;erved, <Q>that he always talked as if he was talking upon oath.</Q> After a long acquaint|ance with this excellent man, and an attentive retro&s;pect to his whole conduct, &s;uch is the light in which he appears to the writer of this e&s;&s;ay.

<P>It remains to give a review of John&s;on's works; and this, it is imagined, will not be unwelcome to the reader.</P>
<P>Like Milton and Addi&s;on, he &s;eems to have been fond of his Latin poetry. Tho&s;e com|po&s;itions &s;hew that he was an early &s;cholar; but his ver&s;es have not the graceful ea&s;e that gave &s;o much &s;uavity to the poems of Addi&s;on. The tran&s;lation of the Me&s;&s;iah labours under
<PB N="148" REF="152">
two di&s;advantages; it is fir&s;t to be compared with Pope's inimitable performance, and after|wards with the Pollio of Virgil. It may ap|pear trifling to remark, that he has made the letter <HI>o,</HI> in the word <HI>Virgo,</HI> long and &s;hort in the &s;ame line; VIRGO, VIRGO PARIT. But the tran&s;lation has great merit, and &s;ome ad|mirable lines. In the odes there is a &s;weet flexibility, particularly, To his worthy friend Dr. Laurence; on him&s;elf at the theatre, March 8, 1771; the Ode in the i&s;le of Sky; and that to Mrs. Thrale from the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>His Engli&s;h poetry is &s;uch as leaves room to think, if he had devoted him&s;elf to the Mu&s;es, that he would have been the rival of Pope. His fir&s;t production in this kind was London, a poem in imitation of the third &s;a|tire of Juvenal. The vices of the metropolis are placed in the room of antient manners. The author had heated his mind with the ardour of Juvenal, and, having the &s;kill to po|li&s;h his numbers, he became a &s;harp accu&s;er of the times. The VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES is an imitation of the tenth &s;atire of the &s;ame author. Though it is tran&s;lated
<PB N="149" REF="153">
by Dryden, John&s;on's imitation approaches neare&s;t to the &s;pirit of the original. The &s;ub|ject is taken from the ALCIBIADES of PLATO, and has an intermixture of the &s;entiments of SOCRATES concerning the object of prayers offered up to the Deity. The general propo|&s;ition is, that good and evil are &s;o little under|&s;tood by mankind, that their wi&s;hes when granted are always de&s;tructive. This is exem|plified in a variety of in&s;tances, &s;uch as riches, &s;tate-preferment, eloquence, military glory, long life, and the advantages of form and beauty. Juvenal's conclu&s;ion is worthy of a Chri&s;tian poet, and &s;uch a pen as John&s;on's. "Let us," he &s;ays, <Q>leave it to the Gods to judge what it fitte&s;t for us. Man is dearer to his Creator than to him&s;elf. If we mu&s;t pray for &s;pecial favour, let it be for a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body. Let us pray for fortitude, that we may think the labours of Hercules and all his &s;ufferings, preferable to a life of luxury and the &s;oft repo&s;e of SARDANAPALUS. This is a ble&s;&s;ing within the reach of every man; this we can give our&s;elves. It is virtue, and virtue only, that can make us happy.</Q> In the tran&s;la|tion
<PB N="150" REF="154">
the zeal of the Chri&s;tian con&s;pired with the warmth and energy of the poet; but Juve|nal is not eclip&s;ed. For the various characters in the original the reader is plea&s;ed, in the Engli&s;h poem, to meet with Cardinal Wol&s;ey, Buckingham &s;tabbed by Felton, Lord Straf|ford, Clarendon, Charles XII. of Sweden; and for Tully and Demo&s;thenes, Lydiat, Galileo, and Archbi&s;hop Laud. It is owing to John|&s;on's delight in biography that the name of LYDIAT is called forth from ob&s;curity. It may, therefore, not be u&s;ele&s;s to tell, that LYDIAT was a learned divine and mathema|tician in the beginning of the la&s;t century. He attacked the doctrine of Ari&s;totle and Sca|liger, and wrote a number of &s;ermons on the harmony of the Evangeli&s;ts. With all his merit, he lay in the pri&s;on of <HI>Bocardo</HI> at Ox|ford, till Bi&s;hop U&s;her, Laud, and others, paid his debts. He petitioned Charles I. to be &s;ent to Ethiopia to procure manu&s;cripts. Having &s;poken in favour of monarchy and bi&s;hops, he was plundered by the Puritans, and twice carried away a pri&s;oner from his rectory. He died very poor in 1646.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="155">The Tragedy of Irene is founded on a pa&s;&s;age in KNOLLES'S Hi&s;tory of the Turks; an author highly commended in the Rambler, N^o 122. An incident in the Life of Mahomet the Great, fir&s;t emperor of the Turks, is the hinge on which the fable is made to move. The &s;ub|&s;tance of the &s;tory is &s;hortly this. In 1453 Mahomet laid &s;iege to Con&s;tantinople, and, having reduced the place, became enamoured of a fair Greek, who&s;e name was IRENE. The &s;ultan invited her to embrace the law of the Prophet, and to grace his throne. En|raged at this intended marriage, the Janizaries formed a con&s;piracy to dethrone the emperor. To avert the impending danger, Mahomet, in a full a&s;&s;embly of the grandees, <Q>Catching with one hand,</Q> as KNOLLES relates it, <Q>the fair Greek by the hair of her head, and drawing his falchion with the other, he, at one blow, &s;truck off her head, to the great terror of them all; and, having &s;o done, &s;aid unto them, Now, by this, judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or not.</Q> The &s;tory is &s;imple, and it re|mained for the author to amplify it with pro|per
<PB N="152" REF="156">
epi&s;odes, and give it complication and va|riety. The cata&s;trophe is changed, and horror gives place to terror and pity. But, after all, the fable is cold and languid. There is not, throughout the piece, a &s;ingle &s;ituation to ex|cite curio&s;ity, and rai&s;e a conflict of pa&s;&s;ions. The diction is nervous, rich, and elegant; but &s;plendid language, and melodious numbers, will make a fine poem, not a tragedy. The &s;entiments are beautiful, always happily ex|pre&s;&s;ed, but &s;eldom appropriated to the cha|racter, and generally too philo&s;ophic. What John&s;on has &s;aid of the Tragedy of <HI>Cato</HI> may be applied to Irene: <Q>it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama; rather a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ju&s;t &s;entiments in elegant language, than a repre&s;entation of natural affections. Nothing excites or a&s;&s;uages emotion. The events are expected without &s;olicitude, and are remem|bered without joy or &s;orrow. Of the agents we have no care; we con&s;ider not what they are doing, nor what they are &s;uffering; we wi&s;h only to know what they have to &s;ay. It is unaffecting elegance, and chill philo&s;ophy.</Q> The following &s;peech, in the mouth of a Turk, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have
<PB N="153" REF="157">
heard of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, has been often &s;elected from the numberle&s;s beauties with which IRENE abounds:</P>
<Q><L>"If there be any land, as fame reports,</L>
<L>Where common laws re&s;train the prince and &s;ubject;</L>
<L>A happy land, where circulating pow'r</L>

<L>Sure all unite to hold her league of rule,</L>
<L>Unbroken as the &s;acred chain of Nature,</L>
<L>That links the jarring elements in peace."</L></Q>
<P>The&s;e are Briti&s;h &s;entiments.

When the appendages to a Dramatic Performance are not a&s;&s;igned to a friend, or an unknown hand, or a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, they are always &s;up|po&s;ed to be written by the author of the Play. It is to be wi&s;hed, however, that the Epilogue in que&s;tion could be transferred to any other writer. It is the wor&s;t <HI>Jeu d' E&s;prit</HI> that ever fell from John&s;on's pen.</P>
<P>An account of the various pieces contained in this edition, &s;uch as mi&s;cellaneous tracts, and philological di&s;&s;ertations, would lead be|yond the intended limits of this e&s;&s;ay. It will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that they are the productions of a man who never wanted decorations of lan|guage, and always taught his reader to think. The life of the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as far as it extends, is a model of the biographical &s;tyle. The Review of THE ORIGIN OF EVIL was, perhaps, written with a&s;perity; but the angry epitaph, which it provoked from SOAME JE|NYNS, was an ill-timed re&s;entment, unworthy of the genius of that amiable author.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="159">The Rambler may be con&s;idered as John&s;on's great work. It was the ba&s;is of that high re|putation which went on increa&s;ing to the end of his days. The circulation of tho&s;e periodi|cal e&s;&s;ays was not, at fir&s;t, equal to their merit. They had not, like the Spectators, the art of charming by variety; and indeed how could it be expected? The wits of queen Anne's reign &s;ent their contributions to the Spectator; and John&s;on &s;tood alone. A &s;tage|coach, &s;ays Sir Richard Steele, mu&s;t go for|ward on &s;tated days, whether there are pa&s;&s;en|gers or not. So it was with the Rambler, every Tue&s;day and Saturday, for two years. In this collection John&s;on is the great moral teacher of his countrymen; his e&s;&s;ays form a body of ethics; the ob&s;ervations on life and manners are acute and in&s;tructive; and the papers, profe&s;&s;edly critical, &s;erve to promote the cau&s;e of literature. It mu&s;t, however, be ac|knowledged, that a &s;ettled gloom hangs over the author's mind; and all the e&s;&s;ays, except eight or ten, coming from the &s;ame fountain|head, no wonder that they have the racine&s;s of the &s;oil from which they &s;prung. Of this uni|formity
<PB N="156" REF="160">
John&s;on was &s;en&s;ible. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if he had joined a friend or two, who would have been able to intermix papers of a &s;prightly turn, the collection would have been more mi&s;cellaneous, and, by con&s;equence, more agreeable to the generality of readers. This he u&s;ed to illu&s;trate by repeating two beautiful &s;tanzas from his own Ode to Cave, or <HI>Sylvanus Urban:</HI></P>

<P>It is remarkable, that the pomp of diction, which has been objected to John&s;on, was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed in the Rambler. His Dictionary was going on at the &s;ame time, and, in the cour&s;e of that work, as he grew familiar with technical and &s;chola&s;tic words, he thought that the bulk of his readers were equally learned; or at lea&s;t would admire the &s;plendour and dignity of the
<PB N="157" REF="161">
&s;tyle. And yet it is well known, that he prai&s;ed in Cowley the ea&s;e and unaffected &s;tructure of the &s;entences. Cowley may be placed at the head of tho&s;e who cultivated a clear and natural &s;tyle. Dryden, Tillot&s;on, and Sir William Temple, followed. Addi&s;on, Swift, and Pope, with more correctne&s;s, carried our language well nigh to perfection. Of Ad|di&s;on, John&s;on was u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>He is the Ra|phael of E&s;&s;ay Writers.</HI> How he differed &s;o widely from &s;uch elegant models is a problem not to be &s;olved, unle&s;s it be true that he took an early tincture from the writers of the la&s;t century, particularly Sir Thomas Browne. Hence the peculiarities of his &s;tyle, new com|binations, &s;entences of an unu&s;ual &s;tructure, and words derived from the learned languages. His own account of the matter is, <Q>When common words were le&s;s plea&s;ing to the ear, or le&s;s di&s;tinct in their &s;ignification, I fa|miliarized the terms of philo&s;ophy, by ap|plying them to popular ideas.</Q> But he for|got the ob&s;ervation of Dryden: <HI>If too many fo|reign words are poured in upon us, it looks as if they were de&s;igned, not to a&s;&s;i&s;t the natives, but to conquer them.</HI> There is, it mu&s;t be admitted,
<PB N="158" REF="162">
a &s;well of language, often out of all proportion to the &s;entiment; but there is, in general, a fullne&s;s of mind, and the thought &s;eems to expand with the found of the words. Deter|mined to di&s;card colloquial barbari&s;ms and li|centious idioms, he forgot the elegant &s;implicity that di&s;tingui&s;hes the writings of Addi&s;on. He had what Locke calls a round-about view of his &s;ubject; and, though he was never tainted, like many modern wits, with the ambition of &s;hining in paradox, he may be fairly called an ORIGINAL THINKER. His reading was ex|ten&s;ive. He trea&s;ured in his mind whatever was worthy of notice, but he added to it from his own meditation. He collected, <HI>quae recon|deret, auctaque promeret.</HI> Addi&s;on was not &s;o profound a thinker. He was <HI>born to write, con|ver&s;e, and live with ea&s;e;</HI> and he found an early patron in Lord Somers. He depended, how|ever, more upon a fine ta&s;te, than the vigour of his mind. His Latin Poetry &s;hews, that he reli&s;hed, with a ju&s;t &s;election, all the refined and delicate beauties of the Roman cla&s;&s;ics; and when he cultivated his native language, no wonder that he formed that graceful &s;tyle, which has been &s;o ju&s;tly admired; &s;imple, yet
<PB N="159" REF="163">
elegant; adorned, yet never over-wrought; rich in allu&s;ion, yet pure and per&s;picuous; cor|rect, without labour, and, though &s;ometimes deficient in &s;trength, yet always mu&s;ical. His e&s;&s;ays, in general, are on the &s;urface of life; if ever original, it was in pieces of humour. Sir Roger de Coverley, and the Tory Fox-hunter, need not to be mentioned. John&s;on had a fund of humour, but he did not know it, nor was he willing to de&s;cend to the familiar idiom and the variety of diction which that mode of com|po&s;ition required. The letter, in the Rambler, N^o 12, from a young girl that wants a place, will illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation. Addi&s;on po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an unclouded imagination, alive to the fir&s;t objects of nature and of art. He reaches the &s;ublime without any apparent effort. When he tells us, <Q>If we con&s;ider the fixed &s;tars as &s;o many oceans of flame, that are each of them attended with a different &s;et of planets; if we &s;till di&s;cover new firmaments and new lights, that are &s;unk further in tho&s;e un|fathomable depths of aether, we are lo&s;t in a labyrinth of &s;uns and worlds, and con|founded with the magnificence and immen|&s;ity of nature;</Q> the ea&s;e, with which this
<PB N="160" REF="164">
pa&s;&s;age ri&s;es to unaffected grandeur, is the &s;ecret charm that captivates the reader. John|&s;on is always lofty; he &s;eems, to u&s;e Dryden's phra&s;e, to be o'er inform'd with meaning, and his words do not appear to him&s;elf adequate to his conception. He moves in &s;tate, and his periods are always harmonious. His Oriental Tales are in the true &s;tyle of Ea&s;tern magnifi|cence, and yet none of them are &s;o much ad|mired as the Vi&s;ions of Mirza. In matters of critici&s;m, John&s;on is never the echo of preced|ing writers. He thinks and decides for him&s;elf. If we except the E&s;&s;ays on the Plea&s;ures of Ima|gination, Addi&s;on cannot be called a philo&s;o|phical critic. His moral E&s;&s;ays are beautiful; but in that province nothing can exceed the Rambler, though John&s;on u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the E&s;&s;ay on <HI>The burthens of mankind</HI> (in the Spectator, N^o 558) was the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite he had ever read. Talking of him&s;elf, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q>Topham Beauclerk has wit, and every thing comes from him with ea&s;e; but when I &s;ay a good thing, I &s;eem to labour.</Q> When we compare him with Addi&s;on, the contra&s;t is &s;till &s;tronger. Addi&s;on lends grace and ornament to truth; John&s;on gives it force and energy. Addi|&s;on
<PB N="161" REF="165">
makes virtue amiable; John&s;on repre&s;ents it as an awful duty. Addi&s;on in&s;inuates him&s;elf with an air of mode&s;ty; John&s;on commands like a dictator; but a dictator in his &s;plendid robes, not labouring at the plough. Addi&s;on is the Jupiter of Virgil, with placid &s;erenity talking to Venus:</P>
<Q>"Vultu, quo coelum tempe&s;tate&s;que &s;erenat."</Q>
<P>John&s;on is JUPITER TONANS: he darts his lightning, and rolls his thunder, in the cau&s;e of virtue and piety. The language &s;eems to fall &s;hort of his ideas; he pours along, familiariz|ing the terms of philo&s;ophy, with bold inver|&s;ions, and &s;onorous periods; but we may apply to him what Pope has &s;aid of Homer: <Q>It is the &s;entiment that &s;wells and fills out the diction, which ri&s;es with it, and forms it&s;elf about it; like gla&s;s in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more inten&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>It is not the de&s;ign of this compari&s;on to de|cide between tho&s;e two eminent writers. In
<PB N="162" REF="166">
matters of ta&s;te every reader will chu&s;e for him&s;elf. John&s;on is always profound, and of cour&s;e gives the fatigue of thinking. Addi&s;on charms while he in&s;tructs; and writing, as he always does, a pure, an elegant, and idiomatic &s;tyle, he may be pronounced the &s;afe&s;t model for imitation.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ays written by John&s;on in the Ad|venturer may be called a continuation of the Rambler. The IDLER, in order to be con|&s;i&s;tent with the a&s;&s;umed character, is written with abatad vigour, in a &s;tyle of ea&s;e and unla|boured elegance. It is the Ody&s;&s;ey after the Iliad. Inten&s;e thinking would not become the IDLER. The fir&s;t number pre&s;ents a well|drawn portrait of an Idler, and from that cha|racter no deviation could be made. Accord|ingly, John&s;on forgets his au&s;tere manner, and plays us into &s;en&s;e. He fill continues his lectures on human life, but he adverts to com|mon occurrences, and is often content with the topic of the day. An adverti&s;ement in the beginning of the fir&s;t volume informs us, that twelve entire E&s;&s;ays were a contribution from different hands. One of the&s;e, N^o 33, is the
<PB N="163" REF="167">
journal of a Senior Fellow at Cambridge, but, as John&s;on, being him&s;elf an original thinker, always revolted from &s;ervile imitation, he has printed the piece, with an apology, importing that the journal of a citizen in the <HI>Spectator</HI> almo&s;t precluded the attempt of any &s;ub&s;equent writer. This account of the Idler may be clo&s;ed, after ob&s;erving, that the author's mo|ther being buried on the 23d of January 1759, there is an admirable paper, occa&s;ioned by that event, on Saturday the 27th of the &s;ame month, N^o 41. The reader, if he plea&s;es, may com|pare it with another fine paper in the Rambler, N^o 54, on the conviction that ru&s;hes on the mind at the bed of a dying friend.</P>
<P>"Ra&s;&s;elas," &s;ays Sir John Hawkins, "is a&s;pe|cimen of our language &s;carcely to be paralleled; it is written in a &s;tyle refined to a degree of <HI>imaculate purity,</HI> and di&s;plays the whole force of <HI>turgid</HI> eloquence." One cannot but &s;mile at this encomium. Ra&s;&s;elas is undoubtedly both elegant and &s;ublime. It is a view of human life, di&s;played, it mu&s;t be owned, in gloomy colours. The author's natural melancholy, depre&s;&s;ed, at the time, by the approaching di&s;|&s;olution
<PB N="164" REF="168">
of his mother, darkened the picture. A tale, that &s;hould keep curio&s;ity awake by the artifice of unexpected incidents, was not the de&s;ign of a mind pregnant with better things. He, who reads the heads of the chapters, will find, that it is not a cour&s;e of adventures that invites him forward, but a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of intere&s;t|ing que&s;tions; Reflections on Human Life; the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Imlac,</HI> the Man of Learning; a Di&s;&s;ertation upon Poetry; the Character of a wi&s;e and happy Man, who di&s;cour&s;es with energy on the government of the pa&s;&s;ions, and on a &s;udden, when Death deprives him of his daughter, forgets all his maxims of wi&s;dom and the eloquence that adorned them, yield|ing to the &s;troke of affliction with all the ve|hemence of the bittere&s;t angui&s;h. It is by pic|tures of life, and profound moral reflection, that expectation is engaged and gratified throughout the work. The Hi&s;tory of the Mad A&s;tronomer, who imagines that, for five years, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the regulation of the weather, and that the &s;un pa&s;&s;ed from tropic to tropic by his direc|tion, repre&s;ents in &s;triking colours the &s;ad effects of a di&s;tempered imagination. It be|comes the more affecting, when we recollect
<PB N="165" REF="169">
that it proceeds from one, who lived in fear of the &s;ame dreadful vi&s;itation; from one who &s;ays emphatically, <Q>Of the uncertainties in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the mo&s;t dreadful and alarming is the uncertain continuance of rea&s;on.</Q> The enquiry into the cau&s;e of madne&s;s, and the dangerous prevalence of ima|gination, till, in time, &s;ome particular train of ideas fixes the attention, and the mind re|curs con&s;tantly to the favourite conception, is carried on in a &s;train of acute ob&s;ervation; but it leaves us room to think, that the author was tran&s;cribing from his own apprehen&s;ions. The di&s;cour&s;e on the nature of the &s;oul gives us all that philo&s;ophy knows, not without a tincture of &s;uper&s;tition. It is remarkable that the va|nity of human pur&s;uits was, about the &s;ame time, the &s;ubject that employed both John&s;on and Voltaire; but <HI>Candide</HI> is the work of a lively imagination, and Ra&s;&s;elas, with all its &s;plendour of eloquence, exhibits a gloomy pic|ture. It &s;hould, however, be remembered, that the world has known the WEEPING as well as the LAUGHING philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="170">The Dictionary does not properly fall with|in the province of this e&s;&s;ay. The preface, however, will be found in this edition.

<P>That John&s;on was eminently qualified for the office of a commentator on Shak&s;peare, no man can doubt; but it was an office which he never cordially embraced. The publick ex|pected more than he had diligence to perform; and yet his edition has been the ground on which every &s;ub&s;equent commentator has cho&s;e to build. One note, for its &s;ingularity, may be thought worthy of notice in this place. Hamlet &s;ays, <HI>For if the &s;un breed maggots in a dead dog, being a God-ki&s;&s;ing carrion.</HI> In this
<PB N="167" REF="171">
Warburton di&s;covered the <HI>origin of evil.</HI> Ham|let, he &s;ays, breaks off in the middle of the &s;entence; but the learned commentator knows what he was going to &s;ay, and, being unwil|ling to keep the &s;ecret, he goes on in a train of philo&s;ophical rea&s;oning that leaves the reader in a&s;toni&s;hment. John&s;on, with true piety, adopts the fanciful hypothe&s;is, declaring it to be a noble emendation, which almo&s;t &s;ets the critic on a level with the author. The general ob&s;ervations at the end of the &s;everal plays, and the preface, will be found in this edition. The former, with great elegance and preci&s;ion, give a &s;ummary view of each drama. The preface is a tract of great erudition and philo|&s;ophical critici&s;m.</P>
<P>John&s;on's political pamphlets, whatever was his motive for writing them, whether grati|tude for his pen&s;ion, or the &s;olicitation of men in power, did not &s;upport the cau&s;e for which they were undertaken. They are written in a &s;tyle truly harmonious, and with his u&s;ual dignity of language. When it is &s;aid that he advanced po&s;itions repugnant to the <HI>common rights of mankind,</HI> the virulence of party may
<PB N="168" REF="172">
be &s;u&s;pected. It is, perhaps, true that in the cla|mour rai&s;ed throughout the kingdom John&s;on over heated his mind; but he was a friend to the rights of man, and he was greatly &s;uperior to the littlene&s;s of &s;prit that might incline him to advance what he did not think and firmly believe. In the <HI>Fal&s;e Alarm,</HI> though many of the mo&s;t eminent men in the kingdom con|curred in petitions to the throne, yet John&s;on, having well &s;urveyed the ma&s;s of the people, has given with great humour and no le&s;s truth, what may be called, <HI>the birth, parent|age, and education of a remon&s;irance.</HI> On the &s;ubject of Falkland's i&s;lands. the fine di&s;&s;ua&s;ive from too ha&s;tily involving the world in the calamities of war, mu&s;t extort applau&s;e even from the party that wi&s;hed, at that time, for &s;eenes or tumult and commotion. It was in the &s;ame pamphlet that John&s;on offered bat|tle to JUNIUS; a writer, who, by the uncom|mon elegance of his &s;tyle, charmed every rea|der, though his object was to inflame the na|tion in favour of a faction. Junius fought in the dark; he &s;aw his enemy and had his full blow, while he him&s;elf remained &s;afe in ob|&s;curity. But let us not, &s;aid John&s;on, mi&s;take
<PB N="169" REF="173">
the venom of the &s;haft for the vigour of the bow. The keen invective which he publi&s;hed on that occa&s;ion, promi&s;ed a paper-war between two combatants, who knew the u&s;e of their weapons. A battle between them was as ea|gerly expected as between Mendoza and Big Ben. But Junius, whatever was his rea&s;on, never returned to the field. He laid down his arms, and has, ever &s;ince, remained as &s;ecret as the MAN IN THE MASK in Voltaire's Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The account of his journey to the Hebrides or We&s;tern I&s;les of Scotland, is a model for &s;uch as &s;hall hereafter relate their travels. The author did not vi&s;it that part of the world in the character of an Antiquary, to amu&s;e us with wonders taken from the dark and fa|bulous ages; nor as a Mathematician, to mea|&s;ure a degree, and &s;ettle the longitude and lati|tude of the &s;everal i&s;lands. Tho&s;e, who ex|pected &s;uch information, expected what was never intended. <HI>In every work regard the writer's end.</HI> John&s;on went to &s;ee men and manners, modes of life, and the progre&s;s of civilization. His remarks are &s;o artfully blended with the
<PB N="170" REF="174">
rapidity and elegance of his narrative, that the reader is inclined to wi&s;h, as John&s;on did with regard to GRAY, that <HI>to travel, and to tell his travels, had been more of his employment.</HI></P>
<P>As to John&s;on's Parliamentary Debates, no|thing with propriety can be &s;aid in this place. They are collected in two volumes by Mr. Stock|dale, and the flow of eloquence which runs through the &s;everal &s;peeches is &s;ufficiently known.</P>
<P>It will not be u&s;ele&s;s to mention two more vo|lumes, which may form a proper &s;upplement to this edition. They contain a &s;et of Sermons left for publication by John Taylor, LL.D. The Reverend Mr. Hayes, who u&s;hered the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es into the world, has not given them as the compe&s;ition of Dr. Taylor. All he could &s;ay for his departed friend was, that he left them in &s;ilence among his papers. Mr. Hayes knew them to be the production of a &s;uperior mind; and the writer of the&s;e Memoirs owes it to the candour of that elegant &s;cholar, that he is now warranted to give an additional proof of John&s;on's ardour in the cau&s;e of piety, and every moral duty. The la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e in the collection was intended to be delivered by Dr.
<PB N="171" REF="175">
Taylor at the funeral of John&s;on's wife; but that Reverend gentleman declined the office, becau&s;e, as he told Mr. Hayes, the prai&s;e of the decea&s;ed was too much amplified. He, who reads the piece, will find it a beautiful moral le&s;&s;on, written with temper, and no where overcharged with ambitious ornaments. The re&s;t of the Di&s;cour&s;es were the fund, which Dr. Taylor, from time to time, carried with him to his pulpit. He had the LARGEST BULL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See John&s;on's Letters from A&s;hbourne in Vol. XII. of this edition.</NOTE>in England, and &s;ome of the be&s;t Sermons.</P>
<P>We come now to the Lives of the Poets, a work undertaken at the age of &s;eventy, yet the mo&s;t brilliant, and certainly the mo&s;t popular of all our Author's writings. For this perform|ance he needed little preparation. Attentive always to the hi&s;tory of letters, and by his own natural bias fond of Biography, he was the more willing to embrace the propo&s;ition of the Book&s;ellers. He was ver&s;ed in the whole body of Engli&s;h Poetry, and his rules of critici&s;m were &s;ettled with preci&s;ion. The differtation, in the Life of Cowley, on the metaphy&s;ical Poets of the la&s;t century, has the attraction of
<PB N="172" REF="176">
novelty as well as &s;ound ob&s;ervation. The writers, who followed Dr. Donne, went in que&s;t of &s;omething better then truth and nature. As Sancho &s;ays in Don Qnixotte, they wanted better bread than is made with wheat. They took pains to bewilder them&s;elves, and were ingenious for no other purpo&s;e than to err. In John&s;on's review of Cowley's works, fal&s;e wit is detected in all its &s;hapes, and the Gothic ta&s;te for glittering conceits, and far-fetched allu&s;ions, is exploded, never, it is hoped, to re|vive again.</P>
<P>An author, who has publi&s;hed his ob&s;erva|tions on the Life and Writings of Dr. John|&s;on, &s;peaking of the Lives of the Poets, &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e compo&s;itions, abounding in &s;trong and acute remark, and with many fine and even &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ages, have unque&s;tionably great merit; but if they be regarded merely as containing narrations of the Lives, delinea|tions of the characters, and &s;trictures of the &s;everal authors, they are far from being al|ways to be depended on.</Q> He adds, <Q>The characters are &s;ometimes partial, and there is &s;ometimes TOO MUCH MALIGNITY of mi&s;|repre&s;entation,

<P>In the fir&s;t place, the facts are related upon the be&s;t instelligence, and the be&s;t vouchers that could be gleaned, after a great lap&s;e of time. Probability was to be inferred from &s;uch ma|terials as could be procured, and no man better under&s;tood the nature of hi&s;torical evidence than Dr. John&s;on; no man was more religiou&s;ly an ob&s;erver of truth. If his Hi&s;tory is any where defective, it mu&s;t be imputed to the want of better information, and the errors of uncertain tradition.</P>

been &s;aid, that ju&s;tice has not been done to Swift; that Gay and Prior are undervalued; and that Gray has been har&s;hly treated. This charge, perhaps, ought not to be di&s;puted. John&s;on, it is well known, had conceived a prejudice again&s;t Swift. His friends trembled for him when he was writing that life, but were plea&s;ed, at la&s;t, to &s;ee it executed with temper and moderation. As to Prior, it is pro|bable that he gave his real opinion, but an opinion that will not be adopted by men of lively fancy. With regard to Gray, when he condemns the apo&s;trophe, in which Father Thames is de&s;ired to tell who drives the hoop, Of to&s;&s;es the ball, and then adds, that Father Thames had no better means of knowing than him&s;elf; when he compares the abrupt beginning of the fir&s;t &s;tanza of the bard to the ballad of JOHNNY ARMSTRONG, <HI>"Is there ever a man in all Scot|land;"</HI> there are, perhaps, few friends of John|&s;on, who would not wi&s;h to blot out both the pa&s;&s;ages. It may be que&s;tioned whether the remarks on Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man can be re|ceived without great caution. It has been al|ready mentioned, that Crou&s;az, a profe&s;&s;or in Switzerland, eminent for his Treati&s;e of Logic,
<PB N="175" REF="179">
&s;tarted up a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to that poem. John&s;on &s;ays, <Q>his mind was one of tho&s;e, in which philo&s;ophy and piety are happily united. He looked with di&s;tru&s;t upon all metaphy&s;ical &s;y&s;tems of theology, and was per&s;uaded, that the po&s;itions of Pope were intended to draw mankind away from Reve|lation, and to repre&s;ent the whole cour&s;e of things as a nece&s;&s;ary concatenation of in|di&s;&s;oluble fatality.</Q> This is not the place for a controver&s;y about the Leibnitzian &s;y&s;tem. Warburton, with all the powers of his large and comprehen&s;ive mind, publi&s;hied a Vindica|tion of Pope; and yet John&s;on &s;ays, that <Q>in many pa&s;&s;ages a religious eye may ea&s;ily di&s;|cover expre&s;&s;ions not very favourable to mo|rals, or to liberty.</Q> This &s;entence is &s;evere, and, perhaps, dogmatical. Crou&s;az wrote an Examen of THE ESSAY ON MAN, and after|wards a Commentary on every remarkable pa&s;|&s;age; and though, it now appears that Mrs. Elizabeth Carter tran&s;lated the foreign Critic, yet it is certain that John&s;on encouraged the work, and, perhaps, imbibed tho&s;e early pre|judices which adhered to him to the end of his life. He &s;huddered at the idea of irreligion.
<PB N="176" REF="180">
Hence we are told in the Life of Pope, <Q>Never were penury of knowledge and vulgarity of &s;entiment &s;o happily di&s;gui&s;ed; Pope, in the chair of wi&s;dom, tells much that every man knows, and much that he did not know him|&s;elf; and gives us comfort in the po&s;ition, that <HI>though man's a fool, yet God is wi&s;e;</HI> that human, advantages are un&s;table; that our true honour is, not to have a great part, but to act it well; that virtue only is our own, and that happine&s;s is always in our power. The reader, when he meets all this in its new array, no longer knows the talk of his mo|ther and his nur&s;e.</Q> But may it not be &s;aid, that every &s;y&s;tem of ethics mu&s;t or ought to ter|minate in plain and general maxims for the u&s;e of life? and, though in &s;uch axioms no di&s;covery is made, does not the beauty of the moral theory con&s;i&s;t in the premi&s;es, and the chain of rea&s;on|ing that leads to the conclu&s;ion? May not truth, as john&s;on him&s;elf &s;ays, be conveyed to the mind by a new train of intermediate images? Pope's doctrine about the ruling pa&s;&s;ion does not &s;eem to be refuted, though it is called, in har&s;h terms, pernicious as well as fal&s;e, tend|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h a kind of moral prede&s;tination,
<PB N="177" REF="181">
or over-ruling principle, which cannot be re|&s;i&s;ted. But John&s;on was too ea&s;ily alarmed in the cau&s;e of religion. Organized as the human race is, individuals have different inlets of per|ception, different powers of mind, and different &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure and pain.</P>
<Q><L>All &s;pread their charms, but charm not all alike,</L>
<L>On different &s;en&s;es different objects &s;trike;</L>
<L>Hence different pa&s;&s;ions more or le&s;s inflame,</L>
<L>As &s;trong or weak the organs of the frame.</L>
<L>And hence one ma&s;ter-pa&s;&s;ion in the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Like Aaron's &s;erpent &s;wallows up the re&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>Brumoy &s;ays, Pa&s;cal from his infancy felt him|&s;elf a geometrician; and Vandyke, in like manner, was a painter. Shak&s;peare, who of all poets had the deepe&s;t in&s;ight into human nature, was aware of a prevailing bias in the operations of every mind. By him we are told, <HI>Ma&s;terle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion &s;ways us to the mood of what it likes or looths.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to enquire, whether in the lives before us the characters are partial, and too of|ten drawn with malignity of mi&s;repre&s;entation. To prove this it is alledged, that John&s;on has mi&s;repre&s;ented the circum&s;tances relative to the
<PB N="178" REF="182">
tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t Iliad, and maliciou&s;ly a&s;cribed that performance to Addi&s;on, in&s;tead of Tickell, with too much reliance on the te&s;|timony of Pope, taken from the account in the papers left by Mr. Spence. For a refuta|tion of the fallacy imputed to Addi&s;on, we are referred to a note in the <HI>Biographia Britannica,</HI> written by the late <HI>Judge Black&s;tone,</HI> who, it is &s;aid, examined the whole matter with accu|racy, and found that the fir&s;t regular &s;tate|ment of the accu&s;ation again&s;t Addi&s;on was publi&s;hed by Ruffhead in his Life of Pope, from the materials which he received from Dr. Warburton, But, with all due deference to the learned Judge, who&s;e talents de&s;erve all prai&s;e, this account is by no means accurate.</P>
<P>Sir Richard Steele, in a dedication of the Comedy of the Drummer to Mr. Congreve, gave the fir&s;t in&s;ight into that bu&s;ine&s;s. He &s;ays, in a &s;tyle of anger and re&s;entment, <Q>If that gentleman (Mr. Tickell) thinks him&s;elf injured, I will allow I have wronged him upon this i&s;&s;ue, that (if the reputed tran&s;lator of the fir&s;t book of Homer &s;hall plea&s;e to give us another book) there &s;hall appear
<PB N="179" REF="183">
another good judge in poetry, be&s;ides Mr. Alexander Pope, who &s;hall like it.</Q> The authority of Steele outweighs all opinions founded on vain conjecture, and, indeed, &s;eems to be deci&s;ive, &s;ince we do not find that Tickell, though warmly pre&s;&s;ed, thought proper to vin|dicate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the grand proof of John&s;on's malignity, is the manner in which he has treated the cha|racter and conduct of Milton. To enforce this charge, has wearied &s;ophi&s;try, and exhausted the invention of a party. What they cannot deny, they palliate; what they cannot prove, they &s;ay is probable. But why all this rage again&s;t Dr. John&s;on? Addi&s;on, before him, had &s;aid of Milton;</P>
<Q><L>Oh! had the Poet ne'er prophan'd his pen,</L>
<L>To varni&s;h o'er the guilt of faithle&s;s men!</L></Q>
<P>And had not John&s;on an equal right to avow his &s;entiments? Do his enemies claim a privilege to abu&s;e whatever is valuable to Engli&s;hmen, either in Church or State, and mu&s;t the liberty of UNLICENSED PRINTING be denied to the friends of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution?</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="184">It is unnece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue the argument through all its artifices, &s;ince, di&s;mantled of ornament and &s;educing language, the plain truth may be &s;tated in a narrow compa&s;s. John|&s;on knew that Milton was a republican; he &s;ays, <Q>an acrimonious, and &s;urly republican, for which it is not known that he gave any better rea&s;on, than that a popular government was the mo&s;t frugal; for the trappings of a monarchy would &s;et up an ordinary common|wealth.</Q> John&s;on knew that Milton talked <Q>aloud of the danger of READMITTING KING|SHIP in this nation; and when Milton adds, that a commonwealth was commended, or rather ENJOINED, by our Saviour him&s;elf to all Chri&s;tians, not without a remarkable di&s;|allowance, and the brand of Gentili&s;m UPON KINGSHIP,</Q> John&s;on thought him no better than a wild enthu&s;ia&s;t. He knew, as well as Milton, <Q>that the happine&s;s of a nation mu&s;t needs be firme&s;t and certaine&s;t in a full and free council of their own electing, where no &s;ingle per&s;on, but rea&s;on only &s;ways;</Q> but the example of all the republics, recorded in the annals of mankind, gave him no room
<PB N="181" REF="185">
to hope that REASON ONLY would be heard. He knew that the republican form of govern|ment, having little or no complication, and no con&s;onance of parts by a nice mechani&s;m forming a regular whole, was too &s;imple to be beautiful even in theory. In practice it, perhaps, never exi&s;ted. In its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate, at Athens, Rome, and Carthage, it was a con|&s;tant &s;cene of tumult and commotion. From the mi&s;chiefs of a wild democracy, the progre&s;s has ever been to the dominion of an ari&s;tocracy; and the word ari&s;tocracy fatally includes the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t turbulent citizens, who ri&s;e by their crimes, and call them&s;elves the be&s;t men in the State. By intrigue, by cabal, and faction, a pernicious oligarchy is &s;ure to &s;uc|ceed, and end at la&s;t in the tyranny of a &s;in|gle ruler. Tacitus, the great ma&s;ter of poli|tical wi&s;dom, &s;aw, under the mixed authority of king, nobles, and people, a better form of government than Milton's boa&s;ted republic; and what Tacitus admired in theory, but de|&s;paired of enjoying, John&s;on &s;aw e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country. He knew that it had been over|turned by the rage of frantic men; but he knew that, after the iron rod of Cromwell's u&s;urpa|tion,
<PB N="182" REF="186">
the con&s;titution was once more re&s;tored to its fir&s;t principles. Monarchy was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and this country was regenerated. It was re|generated a &s;econd time at the Revolution: the rights of men were then defined, and the ble&s;&s;ings of good order and civil liberty have been ever &s;ince diffu&s;ed through the whole community.</P>
<P>The peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety were what Dr. John&s;on had at heart. He knew that Milton called his Defence of the Regicides, a defence of the people of England, but, how|ever glo&s;&s;ed and varni&s;hed, he thought it an apology for murder. Had the men, who, under a &s;hew of liberty, brought their king to the &s;caffold, proved by their &s;ub&s;equent con|duct, that the public good in&s;pired their ac|tions, the end might have given &s;ome &s;anction to the means; but u&s;urpation and &s;lavery fol|lowed. Milton undertook the office of &s;ecre|tary under the de&s;potic power of Cromwell, offering the incen&s;e of adulation to his ma&s;ter, with the titles of <HI>Director of public Councils, the Leader of unconquered Armies, the Father of his Country.</HI> Milton declared, at the &s;ame time, that <HI>nothing is more plea&s;ing to God, or
<PB N="183" REF="187">
more agreeable to rea&s;on, than that the highe&s;t mind &s;hould have the &s;overeign power.</HI> In this &s;train of &s;ervile flattery Milton gives us the right divine of tyrants. But it &s;eems, in the &s;ame piece, he exhorts Cromwell <Q>not to de|&s;ert tho&s;e great principles of liberty which he had profe&s;&s;ed to e&s;pou&s;e; for it would be a grievous enormity, if, after having &s;ucce&s;s|fully oppo&s;ed tyranny, he &s;hould him&s;elf act the part of a tyrant, and betray the cau&s;e that he had defended.</Q> This de&s;ertion of every hone&s;t principle the advocate for liberty lived to &s;ee. Cromwell acted the tyrant; and, with vile hypocri&s;y, told the people, that he had con&s;ulted the Lord, and the Lord would have it &s;o. Milton took an under part in the tragedy. Did that become the defender of the people of England? Brutus &s;aw his country en&s;laved; he &s;truck the blow for freedom, and he died with honour in the cau&s;e. Had he lived to be &s;e|cretary under Tiberius, what would now be &s;aid of his memory?</P>
<P>But &s;till, it &s;eems, the pro&s;titution with which Milton is charged, &s;ince it cannot be defended, is to be retorted on the character of John&s;on.
<PB N="184" REF="188">
For this purpo&s;e a book has been publi&s;hed, called <HI>Remarks on Dr. John&s;on's Life of Milton, to which are added Milton's Tractate of Education, and Areopagitica.</HI> In this laboured tract we are told, <Q>There is one performance a&s;cribed to the pen of the Doctor, where the pro&s;titution is of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, that it would be difficult to &s;elect an adequate motive for it out of the mountainous heap of conjectural cau&s;es of human pa&s;&s;ions, or human caprice. It is the &s;peech of the late unhappy Dr. William Dodd, when he was about to hear the &s;entence of the law pronounced upon him, in con&s;equence of an indictment for forgery. The voice of the publick has given the honour of manufacturing this &s;peech to Dr. John&s;on; and the &s;tyle and configuration of the &s;peech it&s;elf confirm the imputation. But it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to divine what could be his motive for accepting the office. A man, to expre&s;s the preci&s;e &s;tate of mind of another, about to be de&s;tined to an ignominious death for a capital crime, &s;hould, one would ima|gine, have &s;ome con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that he him|&s;elf had incurred &s;ome guilt of the &s;ame kind.</Q> In all the &s;chools of &s;ophi&s;try is
<PB N="185" REF="189">
there to be found &s;o vile an argument? In the purlieus of Grub-&s;treet is there &s;uch another mouthfull of dirt? In the whole quiver of Malice is there &s;o envenomed a &s;haft?</P>
<P>After this it is to be hoped, that a certain cla&s;s of men will talk no more of John&s;on's malignity. The la&s;t apology for Milton is, that he acted according to his principles. But John&s;on thought tho&s;e principles dete&s;ta|ble; pernicious to the con&s;titution in Church and State, de&s;tructive of the peace of &s;ociety, and ho&s;tile to the great fabric of civil policy, which the wi&s;dom of ages has taught every Briton to revere, to love, and cheri&s;h. He reckoned Milton in that cla&s;s of men, of whom the Roman hi&s;torian &s;ays, when they want, by a &s;udden convul&s;ion, to overturn the govern|ment, they roar and clamour for liberty; if they &s;ucceed, they de&s;troy liberty it&s;elf. <HI>Ut im|perium evertant, Libertatem praeferunt; fi per|verterint, libertatem ip&s;am aggredientur.</HI> Such were the &s;entiments of Dr. John&s;on; and it may be a&s;ked, in the language of Bolingbroke, <Q>Are the&s;e &s;entiments, which any man, who is born a Briton, in any circum&s;tances, in any
<PB N="186" REF="190">
&s;ituation, ought to be a&s;hamed, or afraid to avow.</Q> John&s;on has done ample ju&s;tice to Milton's poetry: the Critici&s;m on Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t is a &s;ublime compo&s;ition. Had he thought the author as good and pious a citizen as Dr. Watts, he would have been ready, notwith|&s;tanding his non-conformity, to do equal ho|nour to the memory of the man.</P>
<P>It is now time to clo&s;e this e&s;&s;ay, which the author fears has been, drawn too much into length. In the progre&s;s of the work, feeble as it may be, he thought him&s;elf performing the la&s;t human office to the memory of a friend, whom he loved, e&s;teemed, and honoured.</P>
<Q><L>His &s;altem accumulem donis, et fungar inani</L>
<L>Munere.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The author of the&s;e memoirs has been anxious to give the features of the man, and the true character of the author. He has not &s;uffered the hand of partiality to colour his excellencies with too much warmth; nor has he endeavoured to throw his &s;ingularities too much into &s;hade. Dr. John&s;on's failings may well be forgiven for the &s;ake of his virtues. His defects were &s;pots in the &s;un. His piety, his kind affections, and the
<PB N="187" REF="191">
good|ne&s;s of his heart, pre&s;ent an example worthy of imitation. His works will remain a monument of genius and of learning. Had he written nothing but what is contained in this edition, the quantity &s;hews a life &s;pent in &s;tudy and meditation. If to this we add the labour of his Dictionary and other various productions, it may be fairly allowed, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay of him&s;elf, that he has written his &s;hare. In the volumes here pre&s;ented to the publick, the reader will find a perpetual &s;ource of plea&s;ure and in&s;truction. With due precautions, authors may learn to grace their &s;tyle with elegance, harmony, and preci&s;ion; they may be taught to think with vigour and per&s;picuity; and, to crown the whole, by a diligent attention to the&s;e books all may advance in virtue.</P>
