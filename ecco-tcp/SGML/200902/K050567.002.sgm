<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. THE PENSIONERS ARE NOT PERFECTLY HAPPY IN SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>IN proce&s;s of a little time, the in|habitants of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> began to be weary of looking on the &s;ame objects. They had examined the woods, the walks, the fields, and the flowers, till all the&s;e became tire&s;ome. The prai&s;e of their patron, Sir Ben|jamin, indeed, was &s;till echoed from lip to lip, but &s;omewhat more faintly than at fir&s;t. At length, they found
<PB N="2" REF="8">&s;o few charms in vegetable nature and &s;till life, that they ca&s;t about for new &s;ources of entertainment. The fir&s;t &s;ymptom of inquietude which I perceived, was by means of the following letter that was put into my hands by the &s;teward, to whom it was directed at the lodge.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To Mr.</HI> SAMUEL SARCASM, <HI>at</HI> STEWARD'S-LODGE, <HI>on</HI> SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Mr.</HI> SAMUEL SARCASM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the four under-written gentlemen, beg of you to repre|&s;ent the following &s;entiments to our worthy patron; namely, to tell him, that we have all our lives been remarkably fond of the &s;ports of the field, and the glories of the
<PB N="3" REF="9">chace; and, although we were once <HI>beat hollow,</HI> yet, by a new management, are &s;ure of our <HI>&s;ides</HI> for the time to come. What we would, therefore, propo&s;e, is, to introduce a little &s;nug &s;tud of running-hor&s;es, rather for the occa&s;ional amu&s;ement of the com|pany, than for any more lucrative view. We find, upon examina|tion, that the turf of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> is remarkably fine for the hor&s;es feet; and, upon mea&s;uring the whole circle within the hou&s;es, it appears, that it would make a mighty pretty mile and a half heat. With leave then of our patron (again&s;t who&s;e con&s;ent we would by no means &s;et up even this mo&s;t manly exerci&s;e), we pro|po&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="10">fixing up a &s;tarting-po&s;t, a booth, &amp;c. upon the <HI>Green,</HI> and to have our monthly matches. This will be attended, Mr. Sarca&s;m, with no charge to Sir Benjamin, unle&s;s he choo&s;es to encourage the in&s;titution &s;o far as to give his pur&s;e of twenty guineas, more or le&s;s, to be run for by four year olds; which, might be a bounty|money in the capacity of patron of the cour&s;e. With regard to hor&s;es, we flatter our&s;elves, that few men in Europe have bred better blooded things; and if we have been u&s;ually <HI>di&s;tanced,</HI> it hath always been on account of bad jockey&s;hip, and not for wanting &s;kill in hor&s;e-fle&s;h. We do not doubt bringing as fine a &s;how of
<PB N="5" REF="11">cattle in a few weeks, as ever were &s;een; and as to the times of running, &amp;c. we will con&s;ider about that. Meantime, are</P>

<P>This propo&s;al was in&s;tantly laid before Mr. Seabrooke, who &s;et up a long whi&s;tle, and &s;aid, he had a great mind to laugh at human nature.</P>
<P>For my part, &s;ir, &s;aid the &s;teward, I think one has more rea&s;on to cry at human nature than to laugh, for
<PB N="6" REF="12">I never yet found her four and twenty hours in the &s;ame mind in my life.</P>
<P>But what is to be done, my dear Seabrooke? &s;aid I,&mdash;what is to be done?</P>
<P><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;cried this &s;ingular man, catching up his hat and &s;tick, and walking off&mdash;<HI>Whew.</HI></P>
<P>Lord, papa, &s;aid Matilda, I can|not &s;ee any harm in the gentlemen's amu&s;ing them&s;elves with a few hor&s;es; be&s;ides which, it will be &s;o charming to have <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green Races.</HI> It will be &s;uch an amu&s;ement for all the ladies and gentlemen, who may &s;ee the whole cour&s;e from beginning to end. Then it will bring &s;uch a
<PB N="7" REF="13">world of good company. Who will not go to <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green Races?</HI> Oh, heavens! I like the idea of all things. Pray, papa, &s;ay <HI>yes.</HI> Let us have a race by all manner of means.</P>
<P>Well, well, my dear, &s;aid I, go and join Mr. Seabrooke (who, I perceive, is whi&s;tling away in the court), and I &s;hall con&s;ider of it. When I had the &s;teward alone, I &s;hut the door, and &s;eizing him by the hand, &s;poke thus: My old friend, I do not well know why, but I tremble upon this &s;ub|ject. The&s;e four gentlemen are, I fear, going to introduce upon us a dangerous entertainment.&mdash;Pray what are their particular circum&s;tances; that is, how are they &s;ituated?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">On my private pen&s;ioners-li&s;t, &s;ir, they cut rather a queer figure of four. Let me &s;ee&mdash;I have the catalogue about me, I think&mdash;Aye; here they are. They come under the letter J&mdash;jockies&mdash;jockies, where are you&mdash;Oh, here we have them.</P>
<P>SPUR&mdash;<HI>Alexander.</HI> Beat out of New-market eight times&mdash;a good|natured man, very hone&s;t; but, a lover of the &s;port.</P>
<P>SLAP-DASH&mdash;<HI>Simon.</HI> A good &s;on and a tender hu&s;band (while hor&s;es are kept out of his &s;ight) would merit the pen|&s;ion, if he were not to meet on the <HI>Green</HI> any gentlemen &s;port&s;men.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="15">CUTCORD&mdash;<HI>Chri&s;topher.</HI> Thought to be as <HI>knowing a one</HI> as ever was &mdash;<HI>taken in.</HI> In other re&s;pects, a harmle&s;s gentleman. Is &s;aid to be the be&s;t &s;hot, al&s;o, in England. Made a point of &s;hoeing his own hor&s;es, and always rode him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHIPWELL&mdash;<HI>William.</HI> Is &s;o broken to the bit, that when he had ruined him&s;elf, and, literally, RUN him&s;elf into jail, he had the bridle and &s;addle of his bay colt, Zephyr, impri&s;oned to keep him company. Otherwi&s;e, ju&s;t, generous, and even moral.</P>
<P>Oh Samuel! Samuel! &s;aid I, at the bottom of this account, what is to be done?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">It does not admit of a que&s;tion, &s;ir&mdash;I wi&s;h it did.</P>
<P>What do you mean, Samuel?</P>
<P>I mean, &s;ir, that if you think proper to &s;et beggars on <HI>bor&s;eback,</HI> they will ride to the Devil. I know, an't plea&s;e your Honour, both man and bea&s;t.</P>
<P>But the peril of this project, Samuel?</P>
<P>We have only to guard again&s;t the effects, &s;ir. You had better &s;ubmit, with a good grace, to what you have no <HI>power to prevent.</HI></P>
<P>But one might expo&s;tulate, Samuel, in a tender manner, obliquely, deli|cately, like a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17">What, &s;ir, expo&s;tulate with four young fellows, who&s;e blood is now galloping through every vein of their bodies, and newly put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two hundred pounds a-year for life!&mdash;&s;ir, it would be <HI>atrocious.</HI></P>
<P>I would not <HI>wi&s;h</HI> any coercive power to remain with me; but, &s;urely, Samuel, if I were to &s;ubmit my apprehen&s;ion of con&s;equences to their judgements.</P>
<P>The judgement of a &s;et of jockies, &s;ir&mdash;your honour makes me &s;mile.</P>
<P>Well, then, Samuel, you &s;hall carry them my an&s;wer to-morrow.</P>

<P>IF I he&s;itated a &s;ingle moment to an&s;wer the letter with which you have honoured me, it was upon the mo&s;t delicate and di&s;intere&s;ted prin|ciple. At the time I invited you to favour me with your company at <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> it was, be a&s;|&s;ured, with no wi&s;h to en&s;lave, but to increa&s;e your liberty, and to in|&s;ure to you that independence which is &s;o &s;uitable to man's &s;pirit.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. SHENSTONE-GREEN RACES CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW days after this permi&s;&s;ion was given, I happened to be cro&s;&s;ing <HI>The Green,</HI> where I per|ceived the&s;e four worthy gentlemen of the whip in clo&s;e con&s;ultation; the &s;ubject of which was, whether the &s;tarting-po&s;t &s;hould be fixed on the ea&s;t or the we&s;t &s;ide, or whether the ladies booth, or gentlemen's, &s;hould be fir&s;t erected. One &s;aid, as the hou&s;es were in a circle that commanded the cour&s;e, booths of any &s;ort were unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I can &s;ee from my dining-room window every inch of ground, &s;aid Mr. Spur.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="23">I will hold you five to four of that, an&s;wered Mr. Cutcord.</P>
<P>And I will go your halves, &s;aid Mr. Whipwell.</P>
<P>Double it, and &s;ay done, cried Mr. Slapda&s;h.</P>
<P>I left them to &s;ettle this intere&s;ting di&s;pute, and walked on.</P>
<P>Ah SHENSTONE! &s;aid I &s;oftly, this is but a bad beginning. The figure of my friend being full in the centre, I went up to it, and was almo&s;t pe|trified to &s;ee the very Founder of the fea&s;t plai&s;tered all over with printed adverti&s;ements. On examining the&s;e more narrowly, I found a formal annunciation of matters intended by the jockey-party, who had &s;tuck and
<PB N="18" REF="24">billed my beloved <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> from the crown of his head to the &s;ole of his foot. One of the adverti&s;ements ran thus: SHENSTONE-GREEN RACES.</P>
<P>MONDAY, May the 1&s;t, the Patron's plate of twenty guineas will be run for by &s;ix year olds. (They took this pur&s;e for granted.)</P>
<P>A &s;weep&s;takes of a hundred guineas.</P>
<P>A private match for fifty pounds.</P>
<P>And &s;everal other by-&s;trokes.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es, intended to &s;tart on the fir&s;t day, are Mr. Spur's <HI>Shen&s;tone.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>Sir Benjamin Beauchamp is ever flattered by the kind attentions of the
<PB N="21" REF="27">gentlemen who have now &s;o particu|larly <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> him; but begs it as a favour, that the figure of Mr. <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> in the centre of the Village, may be con&s;idered as the image of a friend who&s;e generous ideas were the <HI>ha&s;is of the Green,</HI> and who&s;e very &s;tatue, therefore, Sir Benjamin cannot bear to &s;ee di&s;gui&s;ed or disfigured.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In an hour after this was &s;ent off, I under&s;tood by Mr. Seabrooke, that ample ju&s;tice had been done by the jockies to Shen&s;tone's &s;tatue, which was not only cleared of its incum|brances, but wa&s;hed and rubbed into the bargain.</P>
<P>I walked out to &s;ee the alteration, and felt my heart &s;o elated, that I told Mr. Seabrooke I could not but
<PB N="22" REF="28">con&s;ider this &s;udden reverence to our poetical friend's pede&s;tal, as a good &s;ymptom. It is <HI>re&s;pectful,</HI> Mr. Seabrooke, &s;aid I.</P>

<P>I had not time to read the names of the people concerned in this letter, before Matilda cried out, Gracious god, is it po&s;&s;ible! and ju&s;t as &s;he had uttered that exclamation, in came a man in a violent hurry whom the reader will recollect as a pen&s;ioner under the name of Henry Hewit.</P>

<P>Mr. Henry, &s;aid Matilda, you are always giving me a pain in the head, I think. I prote&s;t I have &s;uch a &s;troke here that I mu&s;t take the air a little.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34">Better the head ache than the heart ache, Mi&s;s Matilda; and God knows you'd think of me if you were to &s;ee the poor dears go to mangle and murder them&s;elves for nothing.</P>
<P>In&s;ufferable&mdash;in&s;ufferable, the fel|low's in&s;ufferable, &s;aid Mr. Seabrooke. I mu&s;t follow Matilda.</P>
<P>When the wind is in this corner, I have always weak eyes, cried Samuel Sarca&s;m, blowing his no&s;e.</P>
<P>Then don't go to the cockfighting, Ma&s;ter Sarca&s;m, rejoined Hewit, for that will make 'em wor&s;e, I promi&s;e thee.</P>
<P>Whew&mdash;cried Seabrooke, running out of the room.</P>
<P>Well. &s;ir, added Henry, what may I &s;ay!</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="35">Alas! hone&s;t Hewit, &s;aid I, at the time of providing a town, I did not provide again&s;t the follies nor the vices of its inhabitants, whom, in|deed, I took care to have &s;uch as were lea&s;t &s;ubject, in my opinion, to either vice or folly.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ir, I am &s;orry for it, and will take care to be out of the way when the fighting bouts come on. Your Honour's humble &s;ervant.</P>
<P>He went away.</P>
<P>But you have yet &s;ome authority over your trade&s;men, &s;ir, &s;aid the good &s;teward, and, I think, might take upon you to forbid a thing of this nature. Suppo&s;e we go down together to the trade&s;men's-corner and argue the point per&s;onally. Cock-fighting,
<PB N="30" REF="36">&s;ir, is really atrocious: the idea hath made me &s;ick.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al, we &s;et off for Trade&s;men's-corner, where a croud was ju&s;t at that in&s;tant collected, to &s;ee a pitched battle between a Shen|&s;tone-Green butcher and a Shen&s;tone-Green baker. The blows that re|bounded on their naked bodies were heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and the cries of <HI>&s;trike him, &s;trike him,</HI> at him <HI>Tom,</HI> at him <HI>Dick,</HI> echoed from men, women, and children, who all &s;eemed to be highly delighted with the entertainment.</P>
<P>Sarca&s;m prudently &s;topped &s;hort, and a&s;ked me, if I did not think we might find a le&s;s bloody opportunity for an humane bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37">O Samuel, &s;aid I, it in is vain to forbid tho&s;e to fight cocks, who have a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;laughtering one another.</P>
<P>The &s;ooner we go home to bed, &s;ir, the better, &s;aid Samuel. Let us &s;hut our eyes for a few hours&mdash;<HI>again&s;t the &s;pecies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. A VERY BLOODY CHAPTER, AND A VERY HARD CRUST FOR THE PRO|PRIETOR OF SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>IN due time, reader, the races were run, and the cocks were fought. Would to heaven the wor&s;t misfortune attending the&s;e amu&s;ements had been the disfiguration of the beautiful gra&s;s-plats of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> and throwing idly into the air a large &s;um of money! This, however, was but a part: For the days of the race and of the cock-fight were di&s;tingui&s;hed by many other more memorable cir|cum&s;tances. The bills of both the diver&s;ions being a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly di&s;tri|buted, we had an inundation of
<PB N="33" REF="39">&s;trangers pouring in from all quarters, under pretence of &s;eeing <HI>Shen&s;tone-Sports.</HI> Among&s;t others, came pad|ding into our territory, &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;hamele&s;s women who always attend every di&s;&s;ipated exhibition; and I ab&s;olutely heard a hawker, crying out, while he was running through the ranks between the heats, <Q>A Li&s;t of the Sporting Ladies, Gentlemen. A true Li&s;t of the Sporting Ladies on <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Turning, with rapid indignation, from this unfore&s;een misfortune, I went to another part of the race ground, and came full in the face of an out|rage &s;till more fatal. Exalted above the heads of the people were a mountebank and his men exerting all the ruinous chicane of their itine|racy.
<PB N="34" REF="40">The chief of the&s;e vagabonds harangued the multitude on the in|e&s;timable virtues of his univer&s;al no&s;trum, and I could &s;ee plainly his eloquence was but too palatable. Many bottles of a precious drop, and many boxes of an invaluable powder, were bought of the&s;e em|pericks <HI>then,</HI> which are lying in the bones of the &s;illy purcha&s;ers at this moment.</P>
<P>Seabrooke &s;et up a whi&s;tle on &s;eeing the quacks, and, jumping up on the &s;caffold, offered to buy their whole &s;tock in trade.</P>
<P>That will be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ir, replied one of the fellows, for any man in this or in a much richer nation to compa&s;s. For I have phials, that
<PB N="35" REF="41">&s;carce hold a thimble full of liquid, which are worth a world each.&mdash;Buy our &s;tock in trade, indeed!</P>
<P>Could I have bought them, &s;aid Mr. Seabrooke to me in a whi&s;per, I would certainly have chucked the whole purcha&s;e into one of the ba&s;ons of water; and, by poi&s;oning all your fi&s;h, Benjamin, convince the people what they were at. After which, the vender might have been led out of <HI>The Green</HI> victoriou&s;ly by the no&s;e. As it is, my friend, added he, you mu&s;t not be &s;urprized that the &s;er|pents creep out in the &s;un-&s;hine of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> It is a fine ba&s;king place for them to&mdash;ca&s;t their &s;kins.</P>
<P>Bending my cour&s;e forward, I came at la&s;t to the cock-pit, where
<PB N="36" REF="42">two animals were at that moment engaged in all the ardour of natural animo&s;ity. I had &s;carce time to re|flect how it was po&s;&s;ible for rational beings to find any plea&s;ure in bring|ing creatures together to kill or be killed, when the exclamations of, <HI>&s;ix to two on the Sable,</HI> and <HI>forty to four on the Ginger,</HI> drove me from the &s;cene of horrour. But the violence of the &s;hout &s;till pur&s;ued me; and I heard, di&s;tinctly, that Ginger was &s;truck through the brain, and Sable came off conqueror, with only the lo&s;s of an eye.</P>
<P>But, by this time, the grand run|ning match, which was to fini&s;h the evening, came on. I looked round the circle of hou&s;es, and beheld
<PB N="37" REF="43">every window &s;tuck full with caps and curio&s;ity. Dogs, men, women, and children, were driven from the cour&s;e, and all was clear within the ropes. <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> breathed ex|pectation. Every heart panted, every eye was open. In about a quarter of an hour, four hor&s;es were led along <HI>The Green</HI> by four boys, who were followed by four men. The&s;e were Me&s;&s;ieurs Spur, Slapda&s;h, Cut|cord and Whipwell; but he who had &s;een the&s;e gentlemen a fortnight before, mu&s;t have looked very &s;tea|dily to recognize them. Be&s;ides that they were totally altered in point of dre&s;s, they were totally altered likewi&s;e in point of <HI>bodily dimen&s;ions.</HI> Perhaps there never was naturally, four human beings who&s;e &s;ize &s;o
<PB N="38" REF="44">little re&s;embled each other; and yet they appeared now brought to the &s;ame &s;tandard, yea, to the delicacy of half a dram weight. The truth is, Mr. Slapda&s;h and Mr. Spur (who were both brawny) had been &s;ome time <HI>reducing them&s;elves</HI> to match Me&s;&s;ieurs Cutcord and Whipwell, who were, happily, as much like &s;keletons and &s;carecrows as they <HI>ought</HI> to be. But how &s;uch a corporeal reduction could have been performed upon the carca&s;e of Slap|da&s;h is to this moment a my&s;tery. Surely, reader, it will be &s;uch to thee, when thou art told, that Mr. Slapda&s;h was one of tho&s;e &s;quabby men who&s;e necks are of the &s;ame breadth with the &s;houlders. His cheeks were inflated with &s;olid fat,
<PB N="39" REF="45">and his belly held forth that bur&s;t|ing plenitude which is &s;o remarkably apt to collect in a Briti&s;h &s;ubject. But Mr. Slapda&s;h had, it &s;eems, made his very <HI>per&s;on</HI> the object of a <HI>wager;</HI> and there were very con&s;i|&s;iderable betts depending on his &s;uc|ce&s;s or mi&s;carriage. In a point of &s;uch importance, Mr. Slapda&s;h, willing to increa&s;e his fame, by dimini&s;hing his fle&s;h, &s;hut him&s;elf up in a dark room, on the fifteenth of April, and &s;weated him&s;elf near di&s;&s;olution. None but the per&s;ons who had laid on <HI>his</HI> &s;ide of the que&s;tion were per|mitted to &s;ee him; and &s;ome of the&s;e (fearing his fle&s;h would too ob&s;ti|nately cling to his bones) played upon him &s;everal little tricks, that might tend to his diminution. At one time
<PB N="40" REF="46">they contrived, ju&s;t when the &s;weat|ing draught was operating, to intro|duce into his room a large cat &s;hod with walnut-&s;hells; at another, one of the wags a&s;&s;umed the &s;hape of a &s;pectre in a white &s;heet, and clanged a chain in the dead of night at his bed &s;ide. At other times, they en|velloped him head over heels in &s;o many blankets, that he could &s;carce breathe under them. By &s;uch kind of &s;udorifics he had the good luck, at la&s;t, to melt down all that &s;uper|fluous health and force which &s;tood betwixt him and glory; and to the di&s;may of tho&s;e who had betted on the continuity of his corpulence, he came out of his flannels, on the fir&s;t of May, as meagre and as mi&s;erable a looking mortal, as ever di&s;graced
<PB N="41" REF="47">that noble animal which he was to be&s;tride.</P>
<P>As you, my good reader, did not &s;ee the exact copy of the la&s;t bill, which de&s;cribed the &s;everal dre&s;&s;es of the gentlemen-jockies, I &s;hall ju&s;t acquaint you, that Mr. Cutcord's jacket was blue; Mr. Whipwell's, yellow and white; Mr. Spur's, crim|&s;on; and Mr. Slapda&s;hes, morone. They walked their &s;teeds to the &s;tarting-po&s;t; they were &s;eparately weighed in the &s;cales, and &s;et off. What a thrilling moment!</P>
<P>I looked with all my might for the plea&s;ure which is &s;aid to lie <HI>full in the view,</HI> when four men on hor&s;e|back are re&s;olved to out&s;trip one ano|ther in &s;peed, as much and as far as
<PB N="42" REF="48">po&s;&s;ible. I am almo&s;t afraid, le&s;t I &s;hould ruin the credit of my book with all jockies, &s;hould I confe&s;s, (which, were I not per&s;uaded tho&s;e gentlemen never read, I &s;hould <HI>not</HI> venture) that I could not work my|&s;elf up to one poor &s;en&s;ation of &s;atis|faction. The whole appeared to me &s;o perfectly a matter of the &s;ame con&s;equence, that I did not care one farthing about it. To be the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> I could not think any honour, and to be la&s;t I could not imagine any &s;hame. I a&s;ked Mr. Seabrooke's opinion of this. Have <HI>you</HI> any warm feelings, my good friend?</P>
<P>Whew&mdash;an&s;wered Mr. Seabrooke, wheeling away to another part of the ground.&mdash;Feelings&mdash;Whew.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49">Not &s;o the &s;pectators. No &s;ooner did the jockies come to the pu&s;hing-place, than the confu&s;ion of the chace began; and, as the hor&s;es ap|proached that part of the cour&s;e where the grand trials were to be made, where the whip was to be cut into the flank, and the &s;pur dug into the &s;ide, the loude&s;t acclama|tions of pa&s;&s;ion and of plea&s;ure re|echoed to the &s;hore. What that could agonize <HI>my</HI> heart did I not hear! fifty guineas to five (cried one) on the Crim&s;on. An hundred to a China orange on the blue. Morone again&s;t the field, &s;aid a third. Shillings again&s;t guineas to any amount that yellow is di&s;tanced, hollowed a fourth. My <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> again&s;t <HI>yours,</HI> &s;ir, cried two others,
<PB N="44" REF="50">who were clattering their &s;ticks and clapping their hands, what &s;ay you? My <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> to <HI>yours?</HI> Say done if you dare.</P>
<P><HI>Done,</HI> &s;ir, <HI>done,</HI> an&s;wered the other.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this uproar came up to me, in a violent hurry, Mr. Edward Elixir, who was &s;o plea&s;ed and &s;o vexed, that he had alternately laughed and cried during the whole cour&s;e; but there is no &s;taying long in one place to-day, &s;ir, &s;aid he, and away he bounded from &s;ide to &s;ide as rapid as a roebuck.</P>
<P>Mr. Seabrooke bu&s;ied him&s;elf in driving off a parcel of brats who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Shen&s;tone's-&s;tatue,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="51">from the top of who&s;e pe|de&s;tal they had, it &s;eems, a full view of the &s;port. I incontinently begged <HI>pardon,</HI> &s;ir, &s;aid Seabrooke, of the figure; and talked to it on the un|gentle doings of the day, as if it had life.</P>
<P>But the honours of the cour&s;e were much divided, and much ob|&s;tructed. In turning a difficult cor|ner, <HI>Beauchamp</HI> ran butt again&s;t <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> and had well-nigh foun|dered the former; after that, <HI>Beau|champ,</HI> having <HI>too much rein,</HI> ran on the wrong &s;ide the po&s;t, and &s;tumbled on the fetlocks of <HI>Annuity,</HI> which <HI>Rent-free</HI> perceiving, whipped up and was &s;couring away on the &s;tretch of victory (which he would certainly
<PB N="46" REF="52">have gained) had not <HI>Annuity</HI> that moment got upon his legs, pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Rent-free</HI> like lightning, and carried off the prize. <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> was brought in, dead lame; and <HI>Beauchamp</HI> was beat hollow.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. THE PROPRIETOR EXERTS HIMSELF; AND IS SO MUCH INSULTED, THAT HE PUTS AN END TO THE CHAPTER ABRUPTLY.</HEAD>
<P>I RETIRED from the cour&s;e in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and &s;ecretly re|&s;olved to attempt &s;ome preventative again&s;t the further increa&s;e of the&s;e di&s;orders. In the mean time, the night was pa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Shen&s;tonians</HI> in riot and revelry, in the fury of planning new follies, and in the triumph of relating the pa&s;t. Upon &s;urveying the &s;cene the next morn|ing, it is difficult to de&s;cribe the ap|pearance of a change &s;o perfect. The &s;oft carpet of verdure that be|fore
<PB N="48" REF="54">covered the plain, was torn into raggedne&s;s by the trampling of bea&s;ts and the bu&s;tlings of men. The ten|der vegetable fences, which before &s;eparated one man's portion from that of a neighbour, were gapped and broken. The flowers lay &s;cattered about their beds in fragments, and the whole &s;cene was <HI>di&s;emparadi&s;ed.</HI> As I ca&s;t my eye forlornly over the pro&s;pect, it brought to my mind the&s;e ver&s;es of Milton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. THE SPORTS OF FALSE DELICACY.</HEAD>
<P>IT was by &s;etting the politene&s;s of the one again&s;t the rudene&s;s of the <HI>other,</HI> that I was able to &s;trike the balance without any con&s;iderable de|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits. We mu&s;t always agree to a compromi&s;e between good and evil fortune. If, &s;aid I, weigh|ing two circum&s;tances, a few unruly and uncultured characters ri&s;e up again&s;t the very &s;hadow of govern|ment, there are other minds &s;o much better di&s;po&s;ed, that pain and plea&s;ure are at lea&s;t equipoi&s;ed. Nay, the latter is, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e predomi|nant: For who will compare five or &s;ix cockfighters and jockies, who have
<PB N="54" REF="60">returned to their old infirmities, to upwards of thirty regular per&s;ons who&s;e gratitude is ever warm, and who&s;e love of order will continue to increa&s;e the felicity of our &s;ociety? Perhaps my la&s;t injunctions might, after all, be carrying my wi&s;hes be|yond my power. I may, perhaps, have &s;tepped over the decent limits of that &s;acred law which every man &s;hould tremble to violate while he is conferring a benefit. The rights of ho&s;pitality are &s;o extremely delicate, that while di&s;tre&s;s or poverty is under its protection, the greate&s;t caution &s;hould be exerted. For the future I am determined to be more circum|&s;pect.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this &s;oliloquy in came Matilda, introducing to me a
<PB N="55" REF="61">female friend and a young pen&s;ioner. I pretended to receive them as new faces, or, at lea&s;t, &s;uch as I had only tran|&s;iently &s;een at the time of their initia|tion. But, in reality, they were that very Sidney and Eliza who&s;e peculiar pa&s;&s;ion for each other hath been already delineated.</P>
<P>Mr. Seabrooke was not at home. He was hunting May-ladies in the wood.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many intricate &s;cenes which I have &s;een pa&s;s in the company of four people, that which was in this interview acted by our extraordi|nary lovers, was not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>I, who was in the &s;ecret, &s;oon found out that there was a double plot
<PB N="56" REF="62">to be &s;u&s;tained, for Mr. Sidney was to pa&s;s as a ca&s;ual acquaintance, and Eliza was not to betray the lea&s;t traits of her affection even to her friend Matilda. Let us &s;ee how this was performed. Nature hath not often a&s;&s;umed a more delicate di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>In compliment, perhaps, to me, the conver&s;ation turned&mdash;notwith|&s;tanding we were then at the <HI>tea-table</HI> &mdash;upon the plea&s;ures of pure <HI>bene|volence;</HI> and upon <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>It warms the heart in &s;uch a manner, &s;aid Eliza: It &s;o anticipates the ely&s;ium we are to expect hereafter&mdash; It brings &s;o much of heaven down upon earth&mdash;Then it gives &s;uch op|portunities of bringing old friends together. (Here &s;he glanced her eye towards Sidney.)</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="63">Madam, &s;aid Sidney&mdash;a little di&s;|concerted&mdash;is there any thing ami&s;s about my per&s;on that you are plea&s;ed to honour it with &s;o <HI>particular</HI> an attention?</P>
<P>No! &s;aid Eliza (rather blu&s;hing).</P>
<P>Is your tea made to your liking, dear Eliza? &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>Perfectly, replied Eliza (willing to turn the conver&s;ation by adverting to trifles), I lately take a great deal of &s;ugar.</P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> cried Sidney, you are much changed then; for I remember&mdash;formerly&mdash;</P>
<P>What do you remember, Mr. Sid|ney? &s;aid Eliza (interrupting him for
<PB N="58" REF="64">fear he &s;hould fini&s;h his blunder) What do you remember?</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid <HI>I,</HI> (willing to give a good-natured lift) we are quite <HI>&s;till</HI> after the hurry of our la&s;t week's amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Amu&s;ements! do you call them, Sir Benjamin? &s;aid Eliza. If I had any of my family who could en|courage; or, if there was any per|&s;on whom I <HI>re&s;pected</HI> that did not re|verence <HI>you,</HI> &s;ir, for the manner in which you expre&s;&s;ed your di&s;plea&s;ure on that occa&s;ion, I &s;hould hate him.</P>

<P>Ble&s;s me, an&s;wered Samuel, your honour &s;eems to know but little of things terre&s;trial. This is to me atrocious. Are you to be told, &s;ir, that the pa&s;&s;ions can make us believe any thing; and while the mi&s;er is

<P>P&s;haw, Mr. Sarca&s;m, &s;aid I (pee|vi&s;hly interrupting him), do you ima|gine I am in a temper to be trifled with?</P>
<P>Scarce had the&s;e words pa&s;&s;ed my lips, before a fine, elegant, &s;plendid, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing young man came into the room with an air of in|genuous di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was Mr. Danby. He fell upon his knee. My dear &s;ir, &s;aid he, my
<PB N="91" REF="97">worthy protector, I am this in&s;tant informed of the offence I have given to &s;ome of the per&s;ons in our neigh|bourhood. I have done wrong, &s;ir.&mdash; I feel.&mdash; I repent. Had I reflected but a moment it would have been impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;The woman &s;truck my fancy.&mdash;I am too apt to follow my feelings, and my &s;en&s;ibility is gene|rally wounded too late.</P>
<P>After &s;uch language, Mr. Danby, what can I &s;ay? I am di&s;armed.</P>
<P>The woman is no longer under my roof, &s;ir. Upon my honour I have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient, Mr. Danby; I hope there will be no further bad con&s;e|quence. I &s;ee your forgetfulne&s;s in the true light, and I do not doubt&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="98">Matilda, who had been &s;itting to embroider in the next room, now opened the gla&s;s door which looked into the apartment where we were talking, and ru&s;hed in with a coun|tenance like the palene&s;s of death.</P>
<P>Mr. Danby's confu&s;ion was vi&s;ible in every feature: He re-a&s;&s;ured me that every thing &s;hould be done to my utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction, and abruptly withdrew.</P>
<P>I was &s;en&s;ibly alarmed; and de&s;iring the &s;teward to po&s;tpone the re&s;t of the bu&s;ine&s;s till the next morning, my daughter and I were left together.</P>
<P>She was &s;till labouring with &s;ome concealed anxiety, and after fixing her eyes on me very tenderly for &s;ome minutes, &s;he fell at my feet, and bathed my hand with her tears.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="99">Matilda, &s;aid I, for God's &s;ake, con&s;ider your poor father.</P>
<P>I am very young, papa; perhaps very fooli&s;h; and am now kneeling for my father's in&s;truction.&mdash;That&mdash; that young gentleman who is ju&s;t gone out, &s;ir&mdash;that young gentle|man &mdash;&s;ir&mdash;</P>

<P>Has given me the greate&s;t mi&s;ery ever &s;ince he has been at the <HI>Green.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;o, Matilda?</P>
<P>Don't be angry with me, dear papa,&mdash;but even if you are, I mu&s;t &s;peak out my whole heart. I have met him at Mi&s;s Elliot's. His figure&mdash; His conver&s;ation&mdash;His manner&mdash;I am
<PB N="95" REF="100">afraid I love him, &s;ir. Indeed I am afraid of it.</P>
<P>Love him, did you &s;ay, Matilda?</P>
<P>But he is a libertine&mdash;he is a rake. I have heard his whole &s;tory.&mdash;Yet, &s;ir, he <HI>confe&s;&s;ed</HI> his errour&mdash;he is not a &s;hamele&s;s man&mdash;he&mdash;Pray, &s;ir, did he not &s;ay, the woman who had &s;educed him was <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ed?</HI></P>
<P>Ah! Matilda&mdash;you are the dear and darling comfort of my life. Heaven knows how long this project of hap|pine&s;s, which I have put into execution upon this <HI>Green,</HI> may be depended on. The edifice was flattering and fair, but, perhaps, it may not prove &s;olid. The gu&s;t of ingratitude may weaken, and the tempe&s;t of contrary pa&s;&s;ions may de&s;troy it. It is po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="94" REF="101">that this little paradi&s;e, which I have rai&s;ed, like a &s;econd Eden, around me, may, like the fir&s;t, which was regu|lated by more powerful patronage, be equally lo&s;t.

<P><PB N="96" REF="102">Before I could end the &s;entence &s;he was weeping upon my neck.&mdash;Ah! my dear papa, &s;aid &s;he, but this is not all. My heart will bur&s;t if you are not acquainted with every thing. I cannot &s;upport the <HI>burden</HI> of hypo|cri&s;y.</P>

<P>Mr. Seabrooke, &s;ir.&mdash;But I did not mention names&mdash;Pray don't hate me&mdash;I never concealed any thing before.</P>
<P>Matilda, Matilda, (&s;aid I, taking her in my arms,) I am not angry; I am both afflicted and rejoiced. Leave the management of this bu&s;ine&s;s to me. Act as before, and all may be well. One truth, however, is

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am a lame and <HI>deafi&s;h</HI> man, who was fir&s;t cut to pieces in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; and after that, being a man of no intere&s;t, hopped and begged upon his maje&s;ty's high|way. On hearing of your &s;cheme,
<PB N="100" REF="106">I thought it might be, now and then, a penny in the way of my di&s;tre&s;s, to try my luck near <HI>Shen|&s;tone-Green;</HI> for, I naturally thought that, people who were &s;upported <HI>them&s;elves</HI> by the generous, would be generous to others. So I made a journey of about &s;ix weeks travel|ling &mdash;for you mu&s;t con&s;ider, &s;ir, I go upon a wooden hor&s;e&mdash;and I am very lately got here, where I walked round and round the <HI>Green.</HI> But, alas &s;ir, begging is but a bad bu&s;ine&s;s, even in a village which was built up by the hand of charity. I do not like to complain, becau&s;e I know the world, and becau&s;e I would not di&s;honour my cloth; but, I find this town &s;o much wor&s;e for <HI>me</HI> than any other, that, were

<P>One of tho&s;e per&s;ons&mdash;God ble&s;s him&mdash;is Ma&s;ter Henry Hewit, who &s;ays, he was once a very poor man him&s;elf; the other is one Squire Danby, who &s;ays, he knows that old lads like me, who have lo&s;t their limbs in a glorious cau&s;e, do not choo&s;e to take money <HI>gratis;</HI> &s;o, by way of making me be|lieve that I <HI>earn</HI> mine, orders me to walk his hor&s;e backwards and forwards; then lead him to water, then back to &s;table, then take off his &s;addle&mdash;for which &s;ervice, he gives me very often a whole guinea,

</LETTER>
<P>As I knew the delicacy of my poor girl's affection, I gave her this letter to read when &s;he was at lei&s;ure, pre|tending that it was a matter of no con&s;equence, but might, perhaps, amu&s;e her a little. I could &s;ee the idea of Mr. Danby mount into her eyes as I gave it.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="110">She put the letter into her pocket, from which moment &s;he was &s;o anxi|ous and unea&s;y, that &s;he pretended a &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition as an excu&s;e for retiring early to her chamber.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than half an hour, &s;he re|turned, declaring that her illne&s;s was gone, and &s;he never was &s;o well or &s;o happy in her life; though it appeared plainly, by a redne&s;s that remained about her eyes, &s;he had been weep|ing. What a paradox is plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>The truth is, I was little le&s;s affect|ed or le&s;s plea&s;ed than her&s;elf at this new trait we had di&s;covered in young Danby, and I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to make him every way worthy my Matilda. I hope reader, &s;he is by this time <HI>thy</HI> favourite.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. HUMAN NATURE LOOKED AT IN AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>PRETTY early the next morning, my daughter was be&s;tirring her|&s;elf in the pantry; and, ju&s;t as I came down &s;tairs, had thrown a white nap|kin over a little wicker ba&s;ket, which &s;he &s;aid, was de&s;tined for Ma&s;ter Hackney Oldblade. Give him this new guinea too, Matilda, &s;aid I, and tell him, it is the late&s;t that has been &s;truck of his &s;overeign.

<P><PB N="106" REF="112">Matilda tripped away with her pro|vi&s;ions without waiting to hear more; and ju&s;t as &s;he was gone, one of Ma&s;|ter Oldblade's friends, Henry Hewit, made his appearance.</P>
<P>Though the conver&s;ation which en&s;ued at this interview is very extra|ordinary, I hope, hone&s;t reader, thou ha&s;t heart enough to &s;uppo&s;e it not &s;o <HI>far</HI> out of nature as to be impo&s;&s;ible.

<P>Sir, &s;aid Henry, pulling off his hat with great reverence, I have been
<PB N="107" REF="113">&s;ome days a mi&s;erable fellow, and as I look upon your honour to be my father, I want to tell you why and wherefore I am thus wretched.</P>
<P>Henry, &s;peak?</P>
<P>Your honour has, as I may &s;ay, almo&s;t killed me with kindne&s;s. Pray do not think me wicked if I &s;ay how much happier I was, when <HI>Shen&s;tone|Green</HI> was building, than I am now it is fini&s;hed. Ever &s;ince I had &s;trength in my arms&mdash;and you &s;ee, &s;ir, I am built almo&s;t like a church&mdash; I have been u&s;ed to labour. I have worked, dear, good &s;ir, till work is my play, and play is my work: yes, your honour, I have found it harder to pa&s;s my time &s;ince I had nothing to do, than ever it was for me to get-up
<PB N="108" REF="114">and go to bed with the &s;un. I will tell your honour <HI>why.</HI></P>
<P>Do &s;o, hone&s;t Henry.</P>
<P>When I was a labouring man, I knew that I mu&s;t not eat nor drink till I had done <HI>&s;o much</HI> for bread and <HI>&s;o much</HI> for bed. When that <HI>&s;o much</HI> was fini&s;h|ed, I &s;at me down to a repa&s;t, which was &s;o &s;weetened by my hunger, that every mor&s;el was a fea&s;t. Then I went hobbling home at night as weary as weary. So much the better; I made but one &s;leep of it till day|light, and then got up as gay as a bird to weary my&s;elf again.</P>
<P>But your &s;ituation, Henry, is much more ea&s;y now on <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">Too ea&s;y, a great deal too ea&s;y, &s;ir. I do not know that the bones are the better for &s;tretching on a velvet cu&s;hion. Had I a good education I might, perhaps, amu&s;e my&s;elf with good books or maps, or &s;uch things; but, as I can neither read or write, &s;o as to make any plea&s;ure of it, tis but making my head ache to no purpo&s;e. No, &s;ir, here lies the mi&s;chief; I am a man worth two hundred a year, and have got my fine hou&s;e over my head; my old work-clothes are thrown away; I have things upon my back that do not &s;it at all to my liking. I am not company for the other pen|&s;ioners who have mo&s;t of them &s;pent a good fortune before they came to the <HI>Green.</HI> I think they look too as if they laugh at me when I go by any
<PB N="110" REF="116">of them, as they &s;tand idling at their doors. This conceit hurts my clown's pride &s;o mortally, that I keep out of their &s;ight as much as I can; and to|wards the evenings give them the &s;lip out of my back door. Sometimes I e&s;cape to the next pari&s;h, where my old fellow-labourers live. But even there, I do not find my&s;elf at home as u&s;ual, becau&s;e they geer and fleer, and are jealous of my good fortune, and &s;ay, they cannot think what your honour could &s;ee in my face to &s;tick me up for a gentleman? After this, I am obliged to make them all nearly drunk before they will own me for an old acquaintance. Be&s;ides this, &s;ir, I &s;ee your honour's <HI>trade&s;men</HI> hate me, and think they have one and all a
<PB N="111" REF="117">better right to your bounty than Henry Hewit.</P>
<P>They may think as they plea&s;e, but I con&s;ider Henry Hewit as the be&s;t and worthie&s;t man upon <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>Too good, your honour is too good; for what can I do? I have no exerci&s;e, and &s;o have no appetite. I always am feeling for my leather apron. I &s;ometimes catch up my old trowel and am ready to &s;hed tears over it, as if it were becau&s;e I had thrown away with <HI>it</HI> an old friend that u&s;ed to get me the brown bread that I <HI>bought my&s;elf,</HI> I cannot &s;leep at nights, becau&s;e I am in a &s;ort of a doze all the day. In &s;hort, &s;ir, I look upon it, that I am living a very wicked life, and
<PB N="112" REF="118">with your honour's leave, I will <HI>mend</HI> it.</P>
<P>Is that po&s;&s;ible, friend Henry?</P>
<P>Very po&s;&s;ible, &s;ir; as thus: I will return my pen&s;ion to the dear noble hand out of which I received it: I will live in a little &s;nug hou&s;e among&s;t your honour's trade&s;men: I will take care the people &s;hall know my mind, that there may be no envy nor heart|burning; and I will, if your honour thinks fit, be ma&s;ter ma&s;on and brick|layer of all <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> For this, your honour may pay me from <HI>time to time,</HI> but not all at once; &s;o that though I &s;hall return to my own track and to my own trade&mdash;which few know better&mdash;yet I &s;hall never want either victuals or work; and, to a
<PB N="113" REF="119">poor fellow like me, to want <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e, is to want <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>And are you &s;erious, Henry?</P>
<P>So &s;erious, and plea&s;e your honour, that I &s;hall break my heart if you do not oblige me. But this is not all. I think I know <HI>whom</HI> your honour might put into the hou&s;e and fortune which I &s;hall quit.</P>
<P>I would gladly have a per&s;on of my friend Hewit's recommendation.</P>
<P>Then you mu&s;t know, &s;ir, there is a fine old creature, mangled all over, who has &s;et his face again&s;t our ene|mies, till his trade is fairly cut from him by the naked &s;word. He is a very merry good &s;oul, and when I &s;aw him the other day walking on his
<PB N="114" REF="120">wooden &s;tumps, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, Oh! Henry Hewit, Henry Hewit, there is a man who ought to be in thy place! He is robbed at once of his bu&s;ine&s;s and his blood; be an hone&s;t lad and go back to thy labour, Henry, and &s;peak a good word for a gentleman-&s;oldier, who&s;e hairs are grey, and who&s;e limbs are gone. I cried like a child as I &s;aid this: but if your Honour agrees to my two propo&s;als, I will do nothing but work and laugh all the re&s;t of my life.</P>
<P>I do agree, Henry, and you &s;hall have it ju&s;t in your own way.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ir, if you plea&s;e, I will be|gin to work to-morrow, for I have been &s;ideling backwards and forwards, and I &s;ee there are &s;ome repairs wanting
<PB N="115" REF="121">in the brickwork about the Man&s;ion|hou&s;e. The tiling on the left &s;ide is loo&s;ened, and I have &s;pied out a crack or two in the back chimnies; <HI>one</HI> leans a little.</P>
<P>What then, Henry, your <HI>eyes</HI> have been at work already.</P>
<P>U&s;e, you know, &s;ir, is &s;econd na|ture. I never &s;ee a building of any kind if it is of brick, but I can tell what <HI>&s;hould</HI> be done in a trice. It is in my way. Lord, your Honour, how happy you have made me! but the cement will be better if I were to mix my lime over night. I will go then and temper my mortar&mdash;Lord how happy I am&mdash;to &s;ay the real factotum, I never was &s;o happy in
<PB N="116" REF="122">my life. I mu&s;t ki&s;s your Honour's hand, I mu&s;t indeed.</P>
<P>Here the poor excellent fellow leaped about with unaffected joy, and was carried away into many extrava|gant ge&s;tures by &s;en&s;ations, which do not frequently, I fear, interrupt the tranquility of human beings.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was going out, he turn|ed round to de&s;ire I would not men|tion his name in the affair of the hopping &s;oldier, becau&s;e, &s;aid Henry, it will have a better look if your Honour was to &s;ay, you had heard of Ma&s;ter Oldblade's great <HI>fighting feats,</HI> and made him a pen&s;ioner for the &s;ake of your country; <HI>that,</HI> your Honour knows would plea&s;e the old fellow; for all your &s;word-blade gen|try
<PB N="117" REF="123">have a &s;ort of pride about them&mdash; as to <HI>me,</HI> you may tell him that I am a good bricklayer and mend a crack, or lay a tile for my country as bravely as any man; but, for the matter of fighting, I am a mere me&s;s of milk, and never killed any thing in my life. Say I am gone to my old bu&s;ine&s;s, and had only Ma&s;ter Oldblade's hou&s;e for <HI>a time.</HI></P>
<P>To make any comment on this be|haviour on the part of our bricklayer, would be to &s;u&s;pect the reader's &s;en&s;e and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>I leave it, therefore, with his feel|ings.</P>

<PB N="121" REF="127">of <HI>Cornelys,</HI> where our lights, rooms, and partitions &s;hall &s;hift about at the word of command. This mu&s;t be named <HI>The Country Cornelys on Shen|&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>THIRDLY, WE earne&s;tly intreat your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in erecting a building for <HI>Theatrical</HI> works, to be written by our&s;elves and our hu&s;bands, and to be acted by one another. Though this &s;cheme will certainly be attended with &s;ome expence, yet it will be &s;uch an encouragement to genius, as will rai&s;e up in the pen&s;ioners a laudable emulation; and, indeed, not to have a play-hou&s;e upon <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> (which is, as it were, <HI>poets ground,</HI> and ought to be dedicated to the mu&s;es) would be a &s;in and a
<PB N="122" REF="128">&s;hame. Be&s;ides, if we &s;hould not be able to furni&s;h new pieces among&s;t our&s;elves, there are plenty of play-wrights who will &s;end us their <HI>chef d'aeuvres</HI> from the capital, where, you know, intere&s;t has, now and then, the key of the &s;tage-door; and where the managers <HI>them&s;elves</HI> gene|rally fore&s;tall the dramatick market. We have been looking about the <HI>Green,</HI> and find that our play-hou&s;e will &s;tand va&s;tly well <HI>near the Church,</HI> or rather between that and Par&s;onage+place. So that the mu&s;es will be &s;up|ported by the temple of devotion on one hand, and a doctor of divinity on the other. This we will call <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green Theatre.</HI></P>
<P>FOURTHLY, WE, (above all other things) have &s;et our hearts upon a
<PB N="123" REF="129"><HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> which is at once &s;o inno|cent, &s;o elegant, and &s;o univer&s;ally admired, that, not to have a monthly one on <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> would be &s;uch an impeachment upon our want of ta&s;te as never was heard of. This, therefore, mu&s;t be put in hand imme|diately. Ma&s;ks and dominos may be had from Tavi&s;tock-&s;treet, London. Fancy-dre&s;&s;es depend on our&s;elves.</P>
<P>LASTLY, WE propo&s;e a weekly <HI>Concert of Mu&s;ick,</HI> and, for cheapne&s;s &s;ake, the &s;ame band may &s;erve for the orche&s;tra of our theatre. But as the&s;e dear amu&s;ements will, under your patronage, &s;ir, be ours, we &s;hall, by way of getting back &s;ome of our charges, tax all tickets taken by &s;trangers. The <HI>Shen&s;tonian</HI> pen|&s;ioners
<PB N="124" REF="130">being the only per&s;ons to be admitted gratis, excepting our good and amiable patron, Sir Benjamin, who is, in <HI>each</HI> place, to have a lodge with a decorated canopy fitted up and properly illuminated, under the title of Beauchamp Box, or the Lord Pre&s;ident's Place on <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>Signed by all the Ladies of the <HI>Green,</HI> except Mi&s;s Eliza El|liot, who ob&s;tinately refu&s;es: but as we con&s;ider that girl a particular kind of creature (too grave and too glum for her age) her &s;uffrage hath not been much &s;olicited.</P>

<P>HEIGHO, Samuel! this is pro|mi&s;ing work. Is it not?</P>
<P>Since the writing hereof, &s;ir, there have been &s;ome of the fair petitioners at my office, ju&s;t to &s;trengthen their arguments, by a&s;&s;uring your Honour that, with tho&s;e few diver&s;ions men|tioned in their li&s;t, they will under|take to make <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> &s;uperior either to Bath or Paris. They add, furthermore&mdash;and as all &s;poke of it <HI>together,</HI> there is the le&s;s doubt of their &s;incerity&mdash;that, there &s;hall not be a &s;ingle hour in the day or night, but what &s;hall bear its characteri&s;tic
<PB N="126" REF="132">amu&s;ement. <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> Samuel &mdash;I believe they might &s;ay, <HI>old</HI> Sa|muel &mdash;<HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> old Samuel, &s;hall have more <HI>ton</HI> than any &s;pot in the habitable globe, and, by the crouds of fa&s;hion which we &s;hall gather about us, the jubilees of the dear poet <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> &s;hall be more <HI>vivant,</HI> and more <HI>voguei&s;h,</HI> than tho&s;e, even headed by his mirrour Mr. Garrick, of Shake&s;peare him&s;elf. After this, they fluttered out of my office, which was never &s;o perfumed before.</P>
<P>And would you not <HI>prevent</HI> this inundation of luxury, which, Samuel, cannot po&s;&s;ibly, be admitted without an inundation of folly al&s;o?</P>
<P>Prevent it &s;ir, &s;aid Matilda, who was &s;itting on Mr. Seabrooke's knee.
<PB N="127" REF="133">Why would you prevent it? What can be more harmle&s;s than a Pantheon?</P>
<P><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;&s;aid Mr. Seabrooke.</P>
<P>More innocent than a Cornely's? &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;&s;aid Mr. Seabrooke.</P>
<P>More moral than a play-hou&s;e? demanded Matilda.</P>
<P><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;<HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;replied Seabrooke.</P>
<P>Or more enchanting than a ma&s;|querade? a&s;ked Matilda.</P>
<P><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;<HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;<HI>Whew,</HI> an&s;wered Mr. Seabrooke, lengthening and loud|ning his tone, and taking Matilda in his arms into the garden.</P>
<P>You hear Mr. Seabrooke's &s;enti|ment of the matter, Samuel, &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="134">I mu&s;t own, &s;ir, the gentleman's whi&s;tle is loud again&s;t it. I take tho&s;e <HI>Whews</HI> all to be in the negative: flatly in the negative.</P>
<P>Shall I then forbid &s;uch non&s;en&s;es, Mr. Sarca&s;m?</P>
<P>Your Honour half tempteth <HI>me</HI> to <HI>Whew</HI> in the manner of the merry gentleman, who is playing at romps yonder on the gra&s;s-plats with Mi&s;s Matilda. What &s;ignifies your Honour's forbidding a large party of ladies doing the things which they have <HI>&s;et their hearts upon.</HI> Sure your Honour knoweth as little of women as men.</P>
<P>But I &s;o well know the con&s;equence, Samuel. I am &s;o well convinced, that <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> would be in as much
<PB N="129" REF="135">agitation and rattle as London, were I to &s;uffer the&s;e non&s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>And that is the very rea&s;on, &s;ir, why the ladies will certainly carry their de&s;igns into execution, <HI>nem. con. Rattle</HI> is the thing they admire.</P>
<P>Indeed, Samuel?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;ir, they offer only to in|troduce things that are allowed in <HI>all</HI> genteel places, and though your ho|nour choo&s;es to run down cau&s;es to their effects; women &s;eldom go that way to work: they &s;tick firmly to the cau&s;e, and if that tickles, they never look far enough to pick up a na&s;ty con&s;equence, that would only put the poor dears into a per&s;piration. Again, &s;ir, have you not made them
<PB N="130" REF="136">independent, and the free agent, <HI>doth</HI> as he li&s;teth, I have heard.</P>
<P>There, Samuel, is the rub. I have tied my hands voluntarily behind me. I left all to the operations of grateful hearts, and imagined that &s;uch liberty would be law at <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>It is plain therefore, that your Honour mu&s;t give up this point; &s;o we will go to another.</P>
<P>With a very bad grace I can a&s;&s;ure thee, Mr. Sarca&s;m.</P>
<P>Things not po&s;&s;ible your Honour knows, &s;hould not be attempted. Plea&s;e to mark therefore your con&s;ent, and I will &s;ignify the &s;ame to the ladies, who prote&s;ted they &s;hould neither eat, drink, or &s;leep till I &s;ent
<PB N="131" REF="137">your an&s;wer. 'Tis a lady's maxim, &s;ir, to be re&s;tle&s;s till &s;he hath her fair longing.</P>
<P>I now wrote underneath this peti|tion, which was, by the by, abomi|nably &s;crawled, agreeable to Dr. Swift's ob&s;ervation, from corner to corner, the word <HI>granted;</HI> and my hand &s;o trembled as I gave my &s;anc|tion to folly, that I wrote <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as unintelligibly polite as the ladies.</P>
<P>Sarca&s;m &s;igned the petition, as wit|ne&s;s, with a fi&s;t perfectly firm; and, &s;aying, he imagined I had enough for one day, adjourned till another op|portunity, the examination of the other papers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO INTRO|DUCE A CONSTABLE ON SHEN|STONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD &s;carce time to breathe upon this circum&s;tance, before one of a different kind, but tending equally to &s;how me I was but a fooli&s;h fellow, &s;tarted up in the form of the following intelligence; which, by way of de&s;ert, was brought ju&s;t after I had dined.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To Sir</HI> B. BEAUCHAMP.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>HONOURED PATRON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE abandoned women, whom a certain young <HI>Shen&s;tonian</HI> fir&s;t countenanced and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, have not yet quitted the village, though, we under&s;tand, they were
<PB N="133" REF="139">furni&s;hed by Mr. Danby with mo|ney &s;ufficient to take them to whence they came. Seeing them flare about the neighbourhood from day to day, to the great annoyance of female virtue, which is under the &s;hadow of Sir Benjamin's wings, I &s;ought out the haunt which they frequent, and by virtue of mine holy office, exhorted them to quit our <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> threatning, at the &s;ame time, that if they did <HI>not,</HI> they &s;hould be fir&s;t excommu|nicated, and then driven out by the angel of our garden with a flaming &s;word. They an&s;wered hereunto very un&s;eemly, fir&s;t, &s;aying that they had as much right to live in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> as a par&s;on, and, that as to excommunication, that would only be to forbid them going to a
<PB N="134" REF="140">place, which is the la&s;t public ex|hibition they &s;hould at any time think of troubling. After this they changed their addre&s;s, and de&s;ired me to &s;it &s;ociably down. Albeit my profe&s;&s;ion might be degraded, and my cloth &s;tained by &s;itting me down among&s;t the naughty ones; I re&s;olved for once to approach pollu|tion in the hope of wiping it away with holy exhortation. Hereupon, I rehear&s;ed that chapter of the ever|la&s;ting volume, which the &s;criptural &s;age in the character of a father, giveth to young men. I began with <HI>My &s;on, my &s;on,</HI> hearken unto the words of my mouth, &amp;c.&mdash;and went quite through.&mdash;But mark the progre&s;s of abandoned hearts. All the time I was predicating, they
<PB N="135" REF="141">a&s;&s;umed an affected gravity, which impo&s;ed upon my &s;implicity. One of them, patted me upon my cheek, under pretence of prai&s;ing the voice with which I exhorted, and &s;queezed my hand, while &s;he declared I had the true pulpit deportment. A &s;econd &s;troaked my chin, and ob|&s;erved, that, as eloquence was apt to parch the tongue, it might be as well if I were to call for my bottle. while the third&mdash;for the fourth had fled el&s;ewhere for &s;hame&mdash;drew her palm along my knee, and even to the taper of my thigh, &s;aying, &s;he wi&s;hed her <HI>eyes might drop out of her head</HI> if I was not a very proper man. Now it was that I perceived I had got into a den of thieves, who wanted to &s;teal away the virtue,
<PB N="136" REF="142">which I came to in&s;pire. Yes, my honoured patron, three pair of black eyes,&mdash;&s;ent their flames at my honour; and it was only by a precipitate retreat, after being much &s;tirred, in which I le&s;t my hat and wig, which they &s;wore &s;hould pay for my priggi&s;h impertinence, that I could &s;ave mine integrity from the &s;nare. As I ran bald|headed from the door, they hooted me with one accord; and, &s;trange to tell, I have been &s;carce out of my bed &s;ince.</P>
<P>It is incumbent that the&s;e evils be done away, and that the&s;e fair devils be ca&s;t out of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> which otherwi&s;e will be like unto the Strand, where once upon a time, I

<P>How one imprudence treads on another &s;aid I, after having read this letter aloud!</P>
<P>But you &s;ee, &s;aid <HI>Matilda,</HI> &s;miling, the bad women are wholly gone from Mr.&mdash;you <HI>knows who's</HI> papa.</P>
<P>(I concealed Mr. <HI>Danby's</HI> name at the time of reading this letter).</P>
<P>I begin to think, friend Beauchamp, &s;aid Mr. Seabrooke, we mu&s;t have &s;uch a thing as a CONSTABLE in this
<PB N="138" REF="144">&s;ame <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green. Sic tran&s;it glo|ria mundi.</HI></P>
<P>A con&s;table, an&s;wered I, in great con&s;ternation; a <HI>con&s;table</HI> on <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green?</HI></P>
<P>Faith, I begin to think &s;o too, &s;aid the little apothecary (who that day dined at the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, and who had been thrown into an immoderate fit of laughter, by the ludicrous idea of the baldheaded prie&s;t when he was on the retreat). And now you talk of that, &s;aid Mr. Elixer, I have a little private bu&s;ine&s;s to communicate.</P>
<P>Matilda withdrew. Mr. Seabrooke ro&s;e up from the table. And can my dear Seabrooke think it po&s;&s;ible for him to retire?</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="145"><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;replied he, wheeling off into the garden, where he would &s;ometimes pa&s;s half a day upon the gra&s;s-plats in the &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P>Look-you, my dear, cried the wor|thy Welchman, when we were alone. I have got a proclamation of war in my pocket. Yes, my dear, war has been declared in <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> for &s;ome time, and here is a correct li&s;t of the killed and wounded. Elixir <HI>Ned,</HI> mu&s;t knock them <HI>dead</HI> yet.

<P>"A li&s;t of patients now under the cure of Edward Elixir, apothecary and &s;urgeon to the <HI>Shen&s;tonian</HI> pen|&s;ioners."</P>
<P>But look you my patron &s;aid the doctor, I do not let you &s;ee this to
<PB N="140" REF="146">betray the confidence which &s;hould be &s;acred in my profe&s;&s;ion, but becau&s;e I am a little man who loves gratitude, and thinks he ought to have no &s;ecrets with a per&s;on like Sir Benja|min Beauchamp; for <HI>that</HI> Sir Benja|min has made me, Edward Elixir, the riche&s;t, and the gaye&s;t, and the happie&s;t man in Wales. Yes, I do &s;ay, the happie&s;t man in Wales. My little wife, Sir Benjamin, has got, through your kindne&s;s, a large ea&s;y chair which runs upon ca&s;tors, and I aired her ye&s;terday, for the fir&s;t time, all about the <HI>Green:</HI> Yes, and then we both laughed together at the con|ceit, till our mirth became, as it were, a <HI>contagious di&s;order</HI> which put into convul&s;ions all the pen&s;ioners who beheld us. If you had &s;een, &s;ir,
<PB N="141" REF="147">this &s;ight, how you would have laughed! Only to think of &s;uch a &s;lender hop-o'-my-thumb as I, har|ne&s;&s;ed to a kind of go-cart, almo&s;t as big as a waggon, running off at full &s;peed with &s;uch an amazing fine-&s;ized firm-fle&s;hed woman as my wife! Only think of a &s;kipping flea hop|ping away with the maje&s;tic elephant! Oh Je&s;us! my patron, my patron, how happy you have made Teddy Elixir!</P>

<P>Without going any farther, I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my hearty concern for the&s;e gentlemen, and de&s;ired to know the nature of their di&s;orders. Are <HI>the&s;e</HI> pen&s;ioners wounded or killed, Mr. Elixir? It mu&s;t be a very &s;udden affair.</P>
<P>Alas, &s;ir, an&s;wered the apothecary, Venus wounds in a moment.</P>
<P>Venus, Mr. Elixir! Venus?</P>
<P>Lookee you, my patron, you live here at your Man&s;ion-hou&s;e without knowing what pa&s;&s;es in your village. We have of late been vi&s;ited by four Ve|nu&s;es, who have brought more bu&s;ine&s;s upon my hands than I ever had on the

<P>The plain truth then, Mr. Elixir, dive&s;ted of your embelli&s;hment, is, that the unhappy women, who were attracted to the <HI>Green</HI> by tho&s;e con|founded races, have&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, my patron, exactly <HI>that,</HI> my patron. Exactly <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>And, among&s;t other victims le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed, are, I pre&s;ume, the&s;e gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">Je&s;us, my patron, how well you gue&s;s. If I could have gue&s;&s;ed half &s;o well, I wi&s;h I may never laugh again.</P>
<P>And do you think this a laughing matter, Mr. Elixir?</P>
<P>My patron, it is no more than this &s;kip. Our methods of treating that affair are now &s;o infallible, that&mdash;</P>
<P>But the wickedne&s;s, and the im|propriety of the affair; how will you cure that, Mr. Apothecary? That is &s;omething more than your &s;kip, I hope, is it not?</P>
<P>Look-you, my dear patron, Ed|ward Elixir never meddles with other men's bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;tick clo&s;e to the <HI>carca&s;e,</HI> which I know how to manage
<PB N="145" REF="151">tolerably well. But as for the <HI>mind,</HI> that is clean out of my way. That is a branch belonging to Mr. Cu&s;heon the vicar. I can only ma&s;ter <HI>Death;</HI> it is the par&s;on, who &s;hould &s;truggle with the <HI>Devil.</HI> Ha! ha! ha!</P>
<P>But I am a&s;toni&s;hed, Mr. Elixir, that &s;o &s;ober, di&s;creet and <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> a man as Mr. Cu&s;heon &s;hould&mdash;</P>

<P>But his <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> Mr. Elixir&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152">Lack a day, if you think the wor&s;e of him for what I have told you, my patron, I &s;hall be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable man in the world&mdash;There is my blind &s;ide.

<P><PB N="147" REF="153">Oh! my patron, tell me, I pray you, what can make me &s;uch a little infamous apothecary as I am?

Edward&mdash;Edward. Teddy, Ted|dy, Elixir, Elixir. Fie! fie! fie!</P>
<P>While our medical phaenomenon was uttering this rhap&s;ody, he &s;ome|times addre&s;&s;ed <HI>me,</HI> then <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> &s;ometimes &s;tood &s;o as to ob&s;erve his figure in the gla&s;s, as if willing to have his own image in view, while he loaded it with abu&s;e; and &s;ome|times, he pranced about the room in an agony of rage, twitching his wig from &s;ide to &s;ide, and leaping from chair to chair. But, at length, the
<PB N="149" REF="155">vociferation with which he mentioned his being hanged, &amp;c. brought Sea|brooke and Matilda into the room, where they apprehended &s;omething was the matter. Seeing them advance, the wretched apothecary (imagin|ing they were come to hear his dif|grace) caught up his hat, as was always his cu&s;tom; and after a&s;&s;uring us once more, that he was a mo&s;t in|famous little ra&s;cal, ran out of doors.</P>

<P>I WAS contriving how to conceal the circum&s;tance of Mr. Danby from my poor panting Matilda, who always &s;u&s;pected the conver&s;ation turned upon him, though &s;he even had di&s;cretion enough to conceal his very name from Seabrooke.

<P>If you are then, &s;ir, I &s;hould be glad to know how a gentleman, plum|ing him&s;elf upon his genero&s;ity, can &s;uffer four unhappy women, who are
<PB N="152" REF="158">obliged to attend publick places, to be in&s;ulted?</P>
<P>I really do not under&s;tand you, madam.</P>
<P>Let <HI>me</HI> &s;peak, Nancy, to him, (&s;aid a &s;econd woman, more furiou&s;ly cap|ped and hatted than the other). I think your name is Sir Benjamin Beauchamp?</P>
<P>I am &s;o called, madam.</P>
<P>Pray then, Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, what right have your virtuous b&mdash;h&mdash;s of the <HI>Green</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Whew</HI>&mdash; cried Mr. Seabrooke, giv|ing a louder whi&s;tle than I ever before heard, and running out of the room with the ever-delicate Matilda.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="159">So much the better, &s;aid the wo|man, re&s;uming the conver&s;ation. Now Mi&s;s Mock Mode&s;ty is gone, I can &s;peak my mind plainer. I was going to a&s;k, &s;ir, why you permit &s;uch vir|tuous b&mdash;h&mdash;s, as &s;ome of your pen|&s;ioners to <HI>&s;neer</HI> at us as we pa&s;s their doors?</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you are the ladies who have created &s;uch di&s;turbances then in the village; if &s;o, you cannot wonder at any &s;lights you may have received for the irregularity of your conduct.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Benjamin, let <HI>me</HI> &s;peak: (&s;aid a third woman of a le&s;s bold ap|pearance, more decently dre&s;&s;ed, and extremely fine featured) The&s;e ladies, &s;ir, are apt to be warm in their tem|pers;
<PB N="154" REF="160">I have &s;een more misfortunes, and am more tranquil. Have I leave to &s;peak &s;ir?</P>
<P>You have, madam.</P>
<P>The four women, Sir Benjamin, who are now before you, have been all ruined by your &s;ex. We had once the innocence of your own daugh|ter. Each had too tender a heart, and threw away its noble&s;t affections upon a villain who deceived it. Our parents thru&s;t us from their protec|tion, and the door of every friend was &s;hut again&s;t us. The women of virtue, who, perhaps, have given few real <HI>proofs</HI> of it, often told us, we might hone&s;tly <HI>work</HI> for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But, this is only one of the many pre|tences of goodluck, when it wants an apology for in&s;ulting di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="155" REF="161">Who will employ an hand&s;ome young woman di&s;carded by her natural friends, and left &s;truggling in the &s;treets. We have found no &s;uch pro|tectors. What remained after &s;uch un|happy experience? To put our&s;elves into <HI>eternity,</HI> would have added the crime of murder to the misfortune of violation. To expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance from men, on any pure or di&s;intere&s;ted prin|ciple, was ab&s;urdity. Our youth, our beauty, our forlorn &s;ituation, were all arguments again&s;t &s;uch pro|tection. Which is it, &s;ir, of <HI>your</HI> &s;ex, that will honourably &s;helter our's un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances; or which is it, that does not rejoice to &s;ee a lovely form <HI>reduced to purcha&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> &s;ir, is the natural effort of an human being; and you know
<PB N="156" REF="162">the terms on which our bread was to be procured. Why then &s;hould we be in&s;ulted? Why &s;hould complaints be formally lodged again&s;t us, as we un|der&s;tand they are, by per&s;ons who have better luck than our&s;elves? With regard to our coming to this village, we have, alas! but too &s;olid an apology for it. We are the &s;laves of publick events, and always obliged to have a look out for novelties; we are compelled to take advantage of any thing that may promi&s;e a pro&s;|pect of &s;upport. We &s;hift our habi|tations as men &s;hift theirs; and when|ever any place is celebrated as the re&s;ort of much company, there, alas! it is our fatal lot to go and partake the tran&s;ient popularity without the joy. It was told to us by tho&s;e whom
<PB N="157" REF="163">we employed for &s;uch purpo&s;es, that a per&s;on of fortune had erected a new town for the u&s;e of tho&s;e whom mis|chance had brought into decay. We dared not propo&s;e our&s;elves as <HI>candi|dates;</HI> but we thought that tho&s;e who leaped &s;uddenly into pro&s;perity from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of indigence or oppre&s;&s;ion, were the proper objects to relieve us. Lightly come, lightly go, you know, &s;ir. It was probable that the pa&s;&s;ions would lead to di&s;&s;i|pation <HI>&s;uch</HI> as became <HI>all at once</HI> ma&s;ters of a good fortune. Upon the faith of this expectation, we &s;et off for <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> where, we thought we had as natural a right to try our fortune as any other vaga|bonds. As to your principle of building this town upon the ba&s;is of
<PB N="158" REF="164"><HI>purity,</HI> we are, unhappily, not in &s;ituations to pay much regard to &s;uch ideas. Delicacy is obliged to yield to nece&s;&s;ity in our unfortunate ca&s;e; perhaps, &s;ir, we might, in luckier &s;itua|tions, have contributed as much to the glory of <HI>Shen&s;tone Green,</HI> and merited as much the bounty of Sir Benjamin Beau|champ, as tho&s;e who now treat us with indignity. Nay, &s;ir, I even think that, hard as it is with us, you might have founded your village upon a ba&s;is of ju&s;ter and <HI>truer</HI> benignity.</P>
<P>How &s;o, madam, &s;aid I, not a little affected by her di&s;cour&s;e, or with the firm, yet gentle, manner in which it was delivered&mdash;In what particulars, could I have improved the plan of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="165">Pardon me, &s;ir, re&s;umed the young woman, if I &s;ay your bounty might, at the &s;ame expence, have been led through more beneficent channels; &s;ome of its &s;treams, might, &s;urely, have extended to US.&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;tarted.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir, continued the lady, you may &s;tart; but believe me, <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> hath not included the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> pitiable part of the creation, nor in|deed, <HI>that</HI> part, which, under pro|per regulation, have the mo&s;t pathetic claim upon the proprietor's attention. Cu&s;tom, it is true, may deaden the delicacy of tho&s;e feelings, which are the di&s;tingui&s;hing ornaments of the female, and habit, may a&s;&s;i&s;t extreme indigence in conquering our natural decency; but it is not always a &s;ign
<PB N="160" REF="166">that we are <HI>irreclaimable,</HI> when we yield our&s;elves up to the only alter|native that is left. Even the unwar|rantable language we &s;ometimes make u&s;e of, may find a palliative in the extremities to which we are driven. Tho&s;e, &s;ir, who live in a more <HI>ele|vated</HI> &s;tate of misfortune, as they are liable to the brutality only of <HI>one man,</HI> &s;o are they le&s;s excu&s;eable, if they commit tho&s;e crimes which it is in their power to prevent. For, in my opinion, errours are pardonable and puni&s;hable in proportion, as the &s;itu|ation of the culprit renders them more <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>Crimes <HI>nece&s;&s;ary!</HI> madam, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, &s;ir, for certain faults to be if not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> at lea&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="167"><HI>inevitable.</HI> They are annexed to a condition, which can neither be pre|vented by the per&s;on who is reduced, any more than the faults which re&s;ult from&mdash;</P>
<P>This doctrine I fear, madam, cri|ed I, interfering&mdash;This doctrine will not&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the lady, interrupting in her turn: I advance only what I know to be fatally true. My igno|rance in the arts of argument, may, perhaps, involve the fact, I de&s;ire to explain, in &s;ome ob&s;curity, or in too many words; but I am, neverthele&s;s, convinced of the fact it&s;elf. How, for in&s;tance, is it po&s;&s;ible to prevent the effects of <HI>our</HI> di&s;tre&s;s? We are
<PB N="162" REF="168">obliged to the dreadful drudgery of &s;uiting our&s;elves to publick caprice. We are obliged to con&s;ult every man's particular mode of gratification. Na|ture, I believe, &s;ir, leads to a decent behaviour; but there are, I fear, five perverted appetites, which lean to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t plea&s;ure, to one that is deli|cate or true to the original bias of the human feelings. I my&s;elf, Sir Benja|min, am an example of the truth I would illu&s;trate. I remember the time when the exce&s;s of my timidity was imputed to me, by my relations, as a fault. I blu&s;hed almo&s;t at my&s;elf. In this &s;tate of my innocence, when all the affections were fair and impre&s;|&s;ive, a man pretended a generous pa&s;&s;ion, and, when he had thoroughly
<PB N="163" REF="169">made it reciprocal, by breathing a real ardour into a guiltle&s;s heart, he abu&s;ed it. The old &s;tory was again repeated. I was treated as the toy which could plea&s;e no longer, and bequeathed by this barbarous betrayer to his brother-rakes.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e,</HI> were all in the higher ranks of libertini&s;m, and for that rea&s;on I heard le&s;s vulgar language, and &s;aw fewer <HI>examples</HI> of vice. So that, though it would be ab&s;urd to repre|&s;ent my&s;elf as a virtuous woman, I &s;hould have been left wholly without an apology had I been plunged &s;o deep as my companions.</P>
<P>What are not you as wicked a wretch as us, Fanny? cried all the other women.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="170">Give me leave re&s;umed the young creature&mdash;I did not mean to in&s;inuate that as <HI>my</HI> prai&s;e, but as <HI>your excu&s;e.</HI> If you now and then yield to words that might be better not &s;poken; it is, I know, becau&s;e you have had few advantages. Con&s;idering the cruel|ties which you have undergone; the company you have been obliged to keep in order to humour the whim of your friends, and the nece&s;&s;ities you had on all hands to encounter, it would be very extraordinary if you had not picked up &s;ome habits which you are far from admiring, even in your&s;elves. I very well know, Sir Benjamin, that good hearts beat in the bo&s;oms of the&s;e my forlorn a&s;&s;o|ciates. I have &s;een them &s;hare their
<PB N="165" REF="171">hard-earned profits with tho&s;e who have appealed to their bounty. I have &s;een al&s;o the tears drop from their eyes at the agony of that rigid virtue, which would not ea&s;ily have been per&s;uaded to feel as &s;oftly for them. They riot, it is true, but it is to drown the &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t poignant reflection, which would otherwi&s;e obtrude to their di&s;trac|tion. They di&s;&s;ipate it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, but it is in compliance with the wanton ta&s;te of their vi&s;itors. I own even that an oath may occa&s;ionally pa&s;s their lips; but it is the effect of unhappy practice, and never comes delibe|rately from the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="172">Ah! madam, &s;aid I, you touch me too, too tenderly.</P>
<P>All the other poor creatures drop|ped the air of audacity, and held down their heads to conceal at once their &s;hame and their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>If, &s;ir, added the lady, it is yet nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge the features of this horrid picture, that I have taken from the life; &s;uffer me to ob&s;erve, that, we are often beaten for an air of mode&s;ty, and rewarded for an ap|pearance of wantonne&s;s; we are equally the &s;port of the brute, and of the bailiff. We are &s;hut out of &s;ociety that might revive our morals, and we are driven to &s;uch as, of nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t make us wor&s;e. Now then tell
<PB N="167" REF="173">me, &s;ir, if we are not, in &s;ome &s;ort, ju&s;tifiable for &s;eeking a &s;helter where, at lea&s;t, our di&s;grace was not &s;o pub|lick, and where were, in hope, that benevolence was the &s;ame in the pen|&s;ioners of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> as in the bo&s;om of the proprietor. We came hither with &s;uch ideas, and yet, if my companions would conde&s;cend to take council from my example, they would retire from the neighbourhood and try again their fortune in the bu&s;tles and beatings of the world. For my own part, &s;ir, I will delay my departure hence, no longer than while I ob&s;erve, that, if Sir Benjamin Beau|champ had contrived &s;ome quiet a&s;y|lum, where the blu&s;hes of the mo&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="174">unhappy women might have been concealed from&mdash;</P>
<P>While the beautiful and abu&s;ed Fanny was proceeding in her &s;entence, a per&s;on tapped at the door of the apartment, and, when it was opened, there came hobbling in a large lame man whom I had never &s;een.</P>
<P>Before the &s;tranger entered, the women had all turned their faces from the door, as if unwilling to be caught in tears.</P>
<P>I come on my &s;tumps to your Honour, (&s;aid the man) to thank you for your kind intentions in favour of an old battered fellow, who is proud of his &s;cars. Heaven always rai&s;es up a friend to the brave. I am ju&s;t
<PB N="169" REF="175">told by your Honour's &s;teward, that, after tugging about the globe, and &s;u&s;taining many &s;trokes of the body abroad, and more of the heart at home, poor old <HI>Hackney Oldblade</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this name pro|nounced than, the mo&s;t piercing &s;hriek, that, &s;urely ever was uttered, came from the very &s;oul of the young creature who had been &s;o pathetically pleading for her&s;elf and her com|panions.</P>
<P>This &s;hriek bur&s;t from the afflicted Fanny; the man no &s;ooner heard the voice of a woman in di&s;tre&s;s, than he forgot the want of his limbs, and ran upon his &s;tumps to offer a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the moment he ca&s;t his eye on the
<PB N="170" REF="176">&s;ufferer, who&s;e agonies increa&s;ed, the crutches dropped from his hands, and he fell lifele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>Mr. Seabrooke and Matilda came hurrying in: and ju&s;t as they appear|ed, the other three women were &s;o agitated, that they retreated in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>

<P>ISTOOD fixed in amazement; while Matilda was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly ap|plying her &s;melling bottle to Fanny, and Seabrooke was rubbing the tem|ples of Oldblade.</P>
<P>Oh! Fanny, Fanny, (cried the latter recovering) &s;ee to what you have brought your mi&s;erable father.</P>
<P>Father! &s;aid Matilda&mdash;Oh poor, poor dear!</P>
<P>It is <HI>you,</HI> Fanny, who are the author of all the&s;e broken limbs, and of all the&s;e deep furrows, in the
<PB N="172" REF="178">front of poor Oldblade. Your mo|ther's heart broke the year after you left us, and then I did not care what be|came of <HI>me.</HI> I wa&s;ted the good fortune which uncle Tibbs left me, becau&s;e I wanted to wa&s;h away the thought of ever having had a daughter. After this, Fan, I went to &s;ea a &s;econd time, &s;pent all the profits of my fir&s;t voyage, (near five hundred pounds) got my legs knocked off, all the&s;e &s;cars in my poor brea&s;t, and then came home to find all my old friends dead, and beg my bread on his maje&s;ty's highway.</P>
<P>All the time the poor fellow was uttering the&s;e &s;entiments he was en|deavouring, by every means in his power, to revive and comfort the unhappy Fanny, who was di&s;&s;olved
<PB N="173" REF="179">in the tears of penitence and de&s;pair. She drew her hand over her eyes and was by no means able to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Touched at this, the parent a&s;|&s;umed its irre&s;i&s;tible authority in the bo&s;om of the &s;oldier &s;o ab&s;olutely, that he cried out, Well, well, Fan|ny, don't cry, child, don't take on. I forgive thee all my wounds, and all my &s;orrows. Thee ha&s;t, perhaps, had enough of thy own. But, why did&s;t thou &s;uffer poor Hackney to hunt town and country after thee &s;o long? Where did&s;t thee hide thy mi&s;ery all that time?</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ir&mdash;(&s;aid Fanny, rai&s;ing her head but &s;till &s;hutting her eyes) indeed, I was not quite abandoned. I was a &s;olitary wretch who wept in
<PB N="174" REF="180">&s;ecret. Even now, though poverty drove me to &s;eek &s;helter in this place, I have never been able to adopt the example of my a&s;&s;ociates; and, had it not been for the di&s;intere&s;ted bounty of one good gentleman on the <HI>Green,</HI> I mu&s;t certainly have &s;tarved.</P>
<P>Of one gentleman (cried Matilda, in great confu&s;ion). Pray what is his name?</P>
<P>Mr. Henry Hewit, madam, an|&s;wered Fanny. This good man it was who &s;aw me unable to pur&s;ue the u&s;ual practi&s;es of my condition, and took care to provide me with the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life ever &s;ince my &s;ickne&s;s, and I have been very ill&mdash;indeed I have.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="181">I am ea&s;y, &s;aid Matilda; Mr. Henry Hewit is an angel. I, I thought it was him.</P>
<P>But art &s;ick <HI>now,</HI> naughty Fan, (&s;aid Oldblade, drawing up gently the head of her cloak round her neck.) Well, well, but are you &s;ure it was Mr. Henry Hewit that&mdash;</P>
<P>Here Henry him&s;elf came into the room to &s;how me how well he looked in his old working clothes. He was ju&s;t beginning to &s;hake his trowel and flouri&s;h his apron, when Fanny &s;tarted up and exclaimed&mdash;Good God! my benefactor is here. Ble&s;s him! ble&s;s him!</P>
<P>Lookee, Ma&s;ter Henry, &s;aid the &s;oldier, I have no knees, and &s;o I
<PB N="176" REF="182">can't cleverly come down upon them; but, with all the &s;mall &s;hot which have pa&s;&s;ed through and through the&s;e arms, I can, with &s;ome pain, (which I don't heed) lift them up to you, as I have often lifted them up to God Almighty, to thank you for the care you have taken of my poor &s;tray daughter.</P>
<P>Daughter! (exclaimed Henry, throwing his trowel on the floor) and have I been all this time protecting the daughter of my friend and &s;upe|rior, Ma&s;ter Oldblade, without knowing it? Ah! Mi&s;s Fanny, did not I tell you things would turn out better than you imagined? Poor &s;oul, your Honour, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he <HI>wanted</HI> to be a good girl but nobody would give

<P>My &s;plinter of a &s;houlder mu&s;t hurt thy naughty face, Fan; &s;tay, hu&s;&s;ey, and let me make thee a bit of a pil|low thus, &s;aid the father, who took off an old &s;ilk handkerchief from his neck, and &s;pread it for the cheek of his daughter.</P>
<P>Not give thee the <HI>means</HI> to be a good girl, &s;ays I&mdash;(continued Hewit). What! and are you obliged to be wicked <HI>again&s;t your will?</HI> Here's a world for you, &s;aid I.&mdash;So upon this, your Honour, I gave her a little of that which was of no u&s;e to me, and

<P>Stop, &s;top, Henry, &s;top, (hol|lowed, with all his force, Mr. Old|blade)&mdash;don't &s;ay a word more. Don't &s;ay any thing that mu&s;t make me cut your throat. If you could &s;uppo&s;e I thought Henry Hewit capable&mdash;</P>

<P>I won't be prai&s;ed, I won't have fooli&s;h fancies &s;aid to me, Mi&s;s Fan|ny&mdash;Give

<P>Ki&s;s the naughty hu&s;&s;ey, if thee wilt, Henry, an&s;wered Oldblade, but I wi&s;h I may be damned if the pain of a cannon ball made &s;uch a pul|ing baby of me as I am at this minute. I wi&s;h I may be damned if it did.</P>
<P>Henry was advancing to Fanny, who, blu&s;hing ten thou&s;and graces, lifted up her head and looked at the company, as if &s;he begged us not to think of her too hardly.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="186">Good as you are, Ma&s;ter Hewit, (cried Oldblade, in an extacy) &s;he is my daughter, &s;he is my own dear naughty Fanny, and I have a right to have the fir&s;t ki&s;s. Huffey (con|tinued he almo&s;t &s;obbing) how dare you lift your head from my neck till I bid you?</P>

<P>And mine too, I prote&s;t, &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>I will go &s;top the crack in your Honour's chimnies, &s;aid Henry (who ki&s;&s;ed Fanny's hand as it lay on her father's bo&s;om and then went out.)</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="187">Will your Honour permit, &s;aid Oldblade, this naughty girl to have a little room in the hou&s;e which your kind heart is about to give an old &s;oldier? She &s;han't &s;tay, I promi&s;e you, if&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;</P>

<P>Ma&s;ter Oldblade, (&s;aid Mr. Sea|brooke, who had been all the time in great agitation) you and your daughter Fanny, and your friend Hewit, have given me &s;ome pretty &s;evere pangs, for which I &s;hall love
<PB N="182" REF="188">all three of you while I have breath in my body.</P>
<P>While Seabrooke was &s;aying this, Matilda was bu&s;y in adju&s;ting the di&s;compo&s;ed cheeks, hair, and hood of Fanny. She wiped the tears from her eyes with her own handkerchief. She &s;moothed the locks that hung di&s;ordered, and then &s;aid to me, in a whi&s;per, that &s;he thought it would look like a little <HI>&s;anction</HI> which the poor dear &s;eemed to de&s;erve, if I would permit <HI>her</HI> to go acro&s;s the <HI>Green</HI> with Fanny. Then, you know, papa, &s;aid &s;he, none of the people will dare to think ill of her.</P>
<P>Charmed with &s;o exqui&s;ite, and, alas! &s;o uncommon a mark of female
<PB N="183" REF="189">humanity, I left my permi&s;&s;ion with a ki&s;s upon the mouth that graced the propo&s;al.

<P>The father of Fanny &s;tood amazed, and Fanny her&s;elf was covered with crim&s;on. Such was the wonderful effect of that great &s;urprize&mdash;the &s;eeing one woman truly feel for another. With much intreaty, Fan|ny was per&s;uaded to lay her trembling arm within that of Matilda's, who &s;eemed to be <HI>o&s;tentatious</HI> of her ac|quaintance, and in that manner they left the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII. CONTAINING A DUEL WHICH FEW READERS COULD FORESEE.</HEAD>
<P>FINDING my&s;elf left alone in the mid&s;t of &s;uch voluptuous reflec|tions, I walked forth to meet my daughter on her return, that we might &s;hare them together: I found her within a few yards of the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, coming to me with full &s;peed to tell me, that &s;he left Oldblade and Fanny in the arms of each other. Yes, papa, &s;aid &s;he, and there the poor dear lies blu&s;hing, while the &s;oldier chides and ki&s;&s;es her; at part|ing, Fanny lifted up her &s;treaming eyes, and cried out in &s;uch a voice as made <HI>me</HI> weep too&mdash;Oh! Mi&s;s Ma|tilda, Mi&s;s Matilda, were there many
<PB N="187" REF="193">women like you, there would be more female virtue, and fewer guilty wretches like Fanny Oldblade. Lord, papa, is it &s;o very extraordinary to behave kind to one's own &s;ex?</P>
<P>What right have you to call your|&s;elf names hu&s;&s;ey, there are wor&s;e than you yet, &s;aid her father? So, &s;eeing the old fellow going to warm &s;omething in a little &s;auce-pan on the fire, which, he &s;aid, was a cordial to <HI>him</HI> in the wor&s;t of times, and would be &s;o to the naughty hu&s;&s;ey, who was neverthele&s;s, he &s;aid, his own fle&s;h and blood. Then I came away, papa, to make you and Mr. Seabrooke happy.</P>
<P>Mr. Seabrooke, my dear, &s;aid I, is &s;o happy already that he is gone to bed.</P>
<P>"To eat in dreams the cu&s;tard of the day,"</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="194">I &s;uppo&s;e, replied Matilda in the livelie&s;t manner, applying a line from her favourite poet.</P>
<P>Then let us eat ours, my dear, &s;aid I, in the <HI>wood,</HI> broad awake; it is, you &s;ee, one of the fine&s;t evenings we could wi&s;h, and "&s;eems as it were "&s;ent to invite the world abroad," an&s;wered Matilda, u&s;ing another quo|tation from a different author.</P>
<P>Heighty, toity, child you are quite poetical to night.</P>
<P>Quite poetical, papa, Lord who can help it? Poetry, I have heard &s;ay, was fir&s;t invented when the heart was too happy to be contented with pro&s;e. I declare I could now repeat half the ver&s;es of <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> till the
<PB N="189" REF="195">village &s;hould re-echo with beautiful ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Oh! brave! Why then you are in the be&s;t humour in the world for an evening's walk in the wood? Every leaf and flower will, at this time of the night, furni&s;h a gay heart with a rhyme, a &s;imile, or a &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Yes, papa, but I have prettier things than leaves and flowers to make me poetical at pre&s;ent. Fanny Oldblade, never &s;aw Mr. Danby. There, papa, is news for you, Fanny Oldblade never &s;aw Mr. Danby.</P>
<P>How have you found that out, Matilda? Oh! oh! let girls alone to find out &s;ecrets, papa. But I will tell you all about it; you mu&s;t know that, when the women came fir&s;t to town,
<PB N="190" REF="196">poor Fanny was &s;o ill as &s;carce to hold her head up, and was obliged to keep in bed while the other women went about. One of them, told Mr. Danby, they had a &s;ick friend at home who could not &s;tir out, upon which, Mr. Danby put his hand into his pocket and gave them five guineas &mdash;only think, papa, of five guineas&mdash; to buy proper comforting things for her; but the cruel creatures kept all the money, and Fanny never knew at all of the affair till her father, who was pre&s;ent at the time, a&s;ked her, if <HI>&s;he</HI> was not the per&s;on who received five guineas from Mr. Danby. I have received no money, &s;aid &s;he, father, &s;ince I have been in this part of the world, except from Mr. Hewit, who totally &s;upported me, and&mdash;Fan|ny,
<PB N="191" REF="197">papa, was going on with her &s;peech when I ran up to her and ki&s;&s;ed her cheek ten times over.</P>
<P>But why, Matilda, did you take that fit of fondne&s;s in your head, ju&s;t at that cri&s;is?</P>
<P>Why, ju&s;t then? Oh! Heavens, papa! How can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;|tion? I will a&s;&s;ure you, papa, I loved her from that moment better than ever; &s;o, without talking any more, let us li&s;ten to the mu&s;ick of the groves:
<Q><L>Ye flowing Plains, ye breezy Woods,</L>
<L>Ye Bowers and gay Alcoves,</L>
<L>Ye falling Streams, ye &s;ilver Floods,</L>
<L>Ye Grottoes and ye Groves!</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon my word, Matilda, you tag every tenth word with a rhyme.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="198">We were by this time wandering arm and arm in <HI>Shen&s;tone-Wood,</HI> and, propen&s;ely, deviated into &s;uch paths as were lea&s;t frequented; but one would think, that this fore&s;t was fated to produce an adventure as often as ever I entered it. The curfew was ju&s;t flinging its &s;ound through the trees, when all of a &s;udden, we di&s;|tinctly heard a voice coming from the left, pronouncing the&s;e words. Sir, the clock &s;trikes, it is the moment promi&s;ed; I am glad to &s;ee you &s;o exact. The next moment, we heard a reply to this, in the cla&s;hing of &s;words, which denoted a very ob&s;ti|nate engagement. I am a bad &s;word&s;|man, &s;ir, cried &s;ome one; then make u&s;e of your pi&s;tols, &s;ir, replied another. In a minute after, two pi&s;tols were
<PB N="191" REF="199">di&s;charged&mdash;Mr. Danby! exclaimed &s;ome per&s;on, you are wounded, the blood is upon your &s;hirt. I feel it not, replied Danby, load again, &s;ir.</P>
<P>To prevent any further mi&s;chief, I would now have ru&s;hed forwards, but my poor child had fainted at my feet, and I was &s;truggling to get her up into my arms. Meanwhile the com|batants again fired, and a voice direct|ly exclaimed, <HI>My God!</HI> he drops; De&s;i&s;t, &s;ir, de&s;i&s;t, he is at the point of death.</P>
<P>The &s;hriek, which the wretched Matilda now gave, went at once through her father's heart, and alarm|ed the per&s;ons who occa&s;ioned it. Two of them came ru&s;hing through the bu&s;hes, and one, who&s;e name the
<PB N="192" REF="200">reader need &s;carce be told, fell down at the feet of Matilda, and cur&s;ed him&s;elf as the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As if &s;en&s;ible to his touch, &s;he opened her eyes, and cried out&mdash;Ah! Danby, what have you been doing? But you are &s;afe, and I am happy. Here &s;he dropped &s;uddenly on her knee, and remained in that po&s;ture &s;ome time without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Though I dared not intimate my fears, I &s;aw Mr. Danby's danger, again&s;t who&s;e bo&s;om I pre&s;&s;ed my handkerchief to &s;top the blood, which, in de&s;pite of all my efforts, was flow|ing over his &s;hirt. But, ju&s;t as I was going to whi&s;per my apprehen&s;ions to a man who thus forgot his wounds in the embraces of his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;em|braces
<PB N="193" REF="201">which I did not attempt to hinder&mdash;another per&s;on came for|ward, who &s;aid he had extracted the ball from the &s;ide and groin of Mr. Sidney.</P>
<P>Mr. Sidney, exclaimed I, and was Mr. Sidney the antagoni&s;t of Mr. Danby!</P>
<P>Look-you, my patron, replied Mr. Elixir&mdash;for it was he who attended as &s;urgeon&mdash;neither Mr. Sidney, nor Mr. Danby, can po&s;&s;ibly die while they are under my care, and as to the re&s;t, though I do not know what they fought upon, I know they fought like two eagles.</P>
<P>Mr. Danby now began to feel his lo&s;s of blood, and I made &s;hift to give Elixir the cue to lead him off
<PB N="194" REF="202">to examine his wound, without its being &s;u&s;pected by Matilda. Danby had already buttoned up his coat and wai&s;tcoat to prevent &s;u&s;picion; but the livid palene&s;s, which came &s;ud|denly over his countenance, warned him it was time to get away. Yet, even in the mid&s;t of his agony, his principal care was how to do this, &s;o as not too much to alarm Matilda: a&s;&s;uming therefore a chearful coun|tenance, and calling into it a &s;mile, he cried&mdash;Well, Sir Benjamin, we have had our frolick, and can only &s;ay, that it is to you and your fair daughter, to whom we are indebted for the life of one or both of us; for Mr. Sidney and I were both &s;o full of our diver&s;ion, that we &s;hould cer|tainly have gone on to the end of the
<PB N="195" REF="203">chapter had not your interruption &s;aved us. The cau&s;e of the quarrel you &s;hall hear, &s;ir, to-morrow. In the mean time it is unnece&s;&s;ary to enjoin &s;ilence, le&s;t we &s;hould give to the idlers of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> too delicate a &s;ubject for conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>At the end of this &s;peech he took off his hat with a trembling hand, and walked out of the wood very &s;lowly, under the &s;upport of his two &s;econds. Mr. Elixir followed him by another path, telling us that Mr. Sidney was carried off by his friends, and would run no ri&s;que of a di&s;covery. Elixir &s;kipped about in triumph.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="204">Perceiving Matilda on the edge of a relap&s;e, I took her in my arms, and ble&s;&s;ed the du&s;k of the night which enabled me to conceal the whole matter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII. WHICH IS NECESSARY TO THE NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to conceive the terrour in the alteration of my poor daugh|ter's &s;pirits from their late elevation; and as I was obliged to &s;it up with her the whole night, I congratulated my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of my grief, that Seabrooke was in bed; for Matilda was &s;o confident that her friend and in&s;tructor, Seabrooke, would di&s;ap|prove her pa&s;&s;ion for Danby, &s;he had never once &s;uffered his name to be hinted, and it had always fallen out, hitherto, that when the young man came to the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, Seabrooke
<PB N="198" REF="206">was ab&s;ent. Early the next morning Mr. Elixir came to inform us, that both the combatants were in a fair way, and that Mr. Danby had been to vi&s;it Mr. Sidney, when the quarrel had like to have been renewed for a very trifling rea&s;on, namely, by a di&s;|pute which aro&s;e about the propriety of Mr. Danby, <HI>or</HI> Mr. Sidney's be|ginning the explanation which each e&s;teemed due to their patron. It is right, &s;aid Mr. Sidney, that Sir Ben|jamin &s;hould be fully informed of our mi&s;take, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e we were wantonly invading the tran|quillity of his village; but for <HI>me</HI> to tell the &s;tory would be&mdash;</P>
<P>And if you do <HI>not</HI> tell it, Mr. Sidney, replied Danby, we mu&s;t
<PB N="199" REF="207">have another meeting, for, on my part, &s;ituated as I am in the family, it would be gro&s;s indelicacy to &s;peak fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But how did it <HI>end,</HI> Mr. Apothe|cary, &s;aid Matilda, ri&s;ing up in her bed&mdash;How did it end?</P>
<P>It ended, madam, (replied Elixir) giving a &s;kip, and &s;napping his &s;ingers &mdash;ju&s;t as it &s;hould do; for a lady at that time coming into the cham|ber&mdash;</P>
<P>A lady! &s;aids Matilda, agitated&mdash; into who&s;e chamber did that lady&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Sidney's, to be &s;ure, madam, an&s;wered Elixir&mdash;a lady, I &s;ay, at that time entering the chamber, ran to the bed-&s;ide, and cried out, Oh!
<PB N="200" REF="208">Sidney, I heard of your &s;ituation not|with&s;tanding all your caution!</P>
<P>And knowing, madam, as you do the nice feelings of Sidney (&s;aid this gentleman) how have you had the imprudence to make the matter &s;till more my&s;terious by this extraordinary vi&s;it?</P>
<P>Extraordinary vi&s;it, Mr. Sidney, what, when I did not know but you were breathing your la&s;t?</P>
<P>And if I had your delicate circum|&s;pection &s;hould have &s;urvived the very life of Sidney, Mi&s;s Elliot.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Elliot, did you &s;ay, cried Ma|tilda, was that the lady&mdash;Oh! hea|vens! go on, dear Mr. Elixir, go on.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="209">Matilda took hold of the apothe|cary's hand, and &s;miled. I &s;miled too perhaps from a very different idea. Mr. Elixir proceeded.</P>
<P>A &s;hort altercation en&s;ued between all parties, and when Mi&s;s Elliot un|der&s;tood the whole &s;tory, &s;he advi&s;ed, that Mr. Sidney &s;hould, dictate while &s;he wrote, and that Mr. Danby and he &s;hould mutually &s;ign the paper, which was then to be &s;ent by me, as &s;urgeon, confident, and witne&s;s.</P>
<P>And where is that paper, &s;aid I, Mr. Elixir? There, &s;ir, it is, &s;aid the apothecary. I will leave it with you, and give the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the recovery of my patients.</P>
<P>Lo&s;e no time, cried Matilda; and pray, Mr. Elixir, do you know that,
<PB N="202" REF="210">if you cut acro&s;s Plea&s;ant-Pa&s;tures, and leave the Trade&s;man's-Corner as much as po&s;&s;ible to the left, you will get there in a trice; and &s;ave near a quarter of a mile by it. But, "Still your &s;inger on your lips I pray.</P>
<P>I was very glad to hear poetry re|turning upon Matilda.</P>
<P>As to that, madam, an&s;wered Elixir, I have been too infamous a little vil|lain already not to take care of my tongue for the future.</P>
<P>Saying this, he &s;et off, with one of <HI>his</HI> bounds, for the hou&s;e of Mr. Sid|ney; and, as Mr. Seabrooke had not yet come from his chamber, I gave Matilda an opportunity to ri&s;e, which &s;he did almo&s;t in a moment; and
<PB N="203" REF="211">then &s;he ran to a little &s;ummer-hou&s;e at the bottom of the garden, where we opened the paper of ex|planation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV. THE PARTICULARS OF THE DUEL EXPLAINED.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of this was, that Me&s;&s;rs. Danby and Sidney, be|ing in company together, the con|ver&s;ation turned upon the beauties of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> the principal and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of whom, Mr. Sidney in&s;i&s;ted, was the object of <HI>his</HI> affections. Mr. Danby hereupon a&s;&s;erted with equal fervour, that as he did not conceive there was more than one unmarried lady in the vil|lage,
<PB N="205" REF="213">who could be e&s;teemed <HI>perfect,</HI> he imagined he had a right to a&s;k the name of the other's favourite? Sidney's &s;crupulous delicacy, being hurt at this idea, he prote&s;ted that none but his Maker and him&s;elf &s;hould ever know the lea&s;t &s;yllable that might lead to the detection of &s;o &s;acred a circum&s;tance; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, added he, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Dan|by to mi&s;take the per&s;on, who main|tains her &s;uperiority over every other work of animated nature. Mr. Dan|by immediately caught fire, and warned Sidney to take care how any pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>be</HI> might indulge, met a powerful rival in a man, who was not any more than him&s;elf able to bear a
<PB N="206" REF="214">divided affection. It appears then, &s;aid Mr. Sidney, that we love the &s;ame per&s;on. It is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be <HI>otherwi&s;e,</HI> replied Danby, for you frankly confe&s;s there is no &s;econd per&s;on who&s;e comparative at|tractions can&mdash;</P>
<P>No, &s;ir, replied Sidney, the object of my affections as much &s;urpa&s;&s;es every other on the <HI>Green,</HI> as&mdash;</P>
<P>Then there is no occa&s;ion for &s;imiles or allu&s;ions, &s;ir, rejoined Danby; it is clear we have the misfortune to love the &s;ame lady; it only remains to examine the pro|gre&s;s of our re&s;pective pa&s;&s;ions, and to &s;ettle accordingly. <HI>My</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ir, continued Danby, has been touched
<PB N="207" REF="215">with the utmo&s;t delicacy, &s;o as not to di&s;tre&s;s the innocent heart of my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As to delicacy, Mr. Danby, &s;aid the other, I believe it will be allow|ed, by the lady her&s;elf, that mine not only exceeds that of Mr. Danby, but even her own.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall not admit your opinion in <HI>either</HI> in&s;tance, and, I have rea&s;on to think my delicacy, and my appli|cation, more agreeable to the lady than tho&s;e of Mr. Sidney.</P>
<P>Piqued at this, Sidney demanded of his friend, if he would quit his preten&s;ions without further expo&s;tu|lation?</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="216">Never, never, &s;ir, an&s;wered Danby, while I have the power of the&s;e arms to defend them.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ir, cried Sidney, &s;uch de|fence will be nece&s;&s;ary directly. We mu&s;t &s;ettle it without delay.</P>
<P>The paper of explanation acquaint|ed us further, that, after Mr. Sidney had uttered this &s;entence, Mr. Danby and he called on Mr. Elixir, and one or two more friends, to &s;ettle the di&s;pute in the wood. Matilda and I got there &s;oon after, and from <HI>our</HI> arrival, to the time of the &s;eparation of the whole party, particulars have been already de&s;cribed to the reader.</P>
<P>It was not till after the di&s;charge of their pi&s;tols, that they came to
<PB N="209" REF="217">the &s;imple truth of the whole matter; namely, that they had fought very bravely to no purpo&s;e, and that the fair picture, which each had drawn of his mi&s;tre&s;s, did not belong to one woman, but equally to Eliza and Ma|tilda. The whole only &s;erved to prove, that
<Q><L>The lip of the nymph we admire,</L>
<L>Seems for ever adorn'd with a &s;mile.</L></Q></P>
<P>Well, Matilda, &s;aid I (when we had &s;een this account) what do you think of this bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>Shall I be ingenuous, papa, replied &s;he? As ingenuous as is convenient, my dear. Why then, papa, &s;ince all the danger is over, and both are in a very fair way, I own I &s;hall not be &s;orry at this new in&s;tance of Mr. Danby's affection, when I know he
<PB N="210" REF="218">is no longer in pain. But only think of my &s;ly friend, Eliza, papa; I will be whipped if I ever &s;u&s;|pected the matter, and yet now I think of it, her queerne&s;s about Mr. Sidney&mdash;</P>
<P>Come, come, Matilda, &s;aid I, <HI>you</HI> are as &s;ly as your friend Eliza. Here are you, every hour almo&s;t, with that &s;agacious whi&s;tler, Mr. Seabrooke, and he does not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect that&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, cried Matilda&mdash;Mr. Seabrooke is now ju&s;t coming to us. Look, how he &s;trides along the gra&s;s-plat, flouri&s;hing his garters, and look|ing to &s;ee how much &s;un he &s;hall have to day!</P>
