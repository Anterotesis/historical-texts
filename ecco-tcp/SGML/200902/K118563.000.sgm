<HEAD>THE DRAM-SHOP; OR <HI>A PEEP INTO A PRISON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOOK through the land from North to South,</L>
<L>And look from Ea&s;t to We&s;t;</L>
<L>And &s;ee what is to Iri&s;hmen,</L>
<L>Of Life the deadlie&s;t Pe&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is not Want, tho' that is bad,</L>
<L>Nor war, tho' that is wor&s;e;</L>
<L>But Ireland's &s;ons endure, alas!</L>
<L>A &s;elf-inflicted Cur&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go where you will throughout the Realm</L>
<L>You'll find that every vice,</L>
<L>In Cities, Villages and Towns;</L>
<L>From WHISKEY takes its ri&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Prince of darkne&s;s never &s;ent</L>
<L>To Man a deadlier foe,</L>
<L>"My name is Legion," it may &s;ay,</L>
<L>The &s;ource of every woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor does the fiend alone deprive</L>
<L>The labourer of his wealth;</L>
<L>That is not all, it murders too</L>
<L>His hone&s;t name and health.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We &s;ay the times are grievous hard,</L>
<L>And hard they are, 'tis true;</L>
<L>But, Drunkards, to your wives and babes</L>
<L>They're harder made by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Drunkard's Tax is &s;elf-impos'd,</L>
<L>And harde&s;t to endure,</L>
<L>Not all the Taxes half &s;o much</L>
<L>Oppre&s;s the lab'ring poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The State compels no man to drink,</L>
<L>Compels no man to game;</L>
<L>'Tis vice and WHISKEY &s;ink him down</L>
<L>To rags, and want, and &s;hame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The kinde&s;t hu&s;band chang'd by the&s;e</L>
<L>Is for a tyrant known;</L>
<L>The tendere&s;t heart that Nature made,</L>
<L>Becomes a heart of &s;tone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In many a hou&s;e the harmle&s;s babes</L>
<L>Are poorly cloth'd and fed;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e the craving DRAM-SHOP takes</L>
<L>The children's daily bread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It oft has robb'd the heedle&s;s youth</L>
<L>Of health and &s;en&s;es too,</L>
<L>And plung'd his never dying &s;oul</L>
<L>In everla&s;ting Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come neighbour take a walk with me,</L>
<L>Thro' many a Dublin Street;</L>
<L>And &s;ee the cau&s;e of penury,</L>
<L>In hundreds we &s;hall meet.</L>

<LG>
<L>We &s;hall not need to travel far&mdash;</L>
<L>Behold that great man's door;</L>
<L>He well di&s;cerns that idle crew,</L>
<L>From the de&s;erving poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He will relieve with liberal hand</L>
<L>The child of hone&s;t thrift:</L>
<L>But where long &s;cores at DRAM-SHOPS &s;tand</L>
<L>He will with-hold his gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold that &s;hivering female there,</L>
<L>Who plies her woeful trade!</L>
<L>Tis WHISKEY ten to one you'll find,</L>
<L>That hopele&s;s wretch has made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look down tho&s;e &s;teps, and view below</L>
<L>Yon cellar under ground;</L>
<L>There every want, and every woe,</L>
<L>And every Sin, is found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho&s;e little wretches trembling there,</L>
<L>With hunger and with cold,</L>
<L>Were by their parents love of drink,</L>
<L>To Sin and Mi&s;ery &s;old.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ble&s;t be tho&s;e friends <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Philanthropic Society.</HI></NOTE> to human kind,</L>
<L>Who take tho&s;e wretches up,</L>
<L>Ere they have drunk the bitter dregs</L>
<L>Of their &s;ad parents cup.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look thro' that pri&s;on's iron bars,</L>
<L>Look thro' that di&s;mal grate;</L>
<L>And learn what dire misfortunes brought</L>
<L>So terrible a fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Debtor and the Felon too,</L>
<L>Tho' differing in di&s;grace,</L>
<L>By WHISKEY you'll too often find,</L>
<L>Were brought to this &s;ad place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Heaven forbid I &s;hould confound</L>
<L>Calamity with guilt!</L>
<L>Or name the Debtor's le&s;&s;er fault,</L>
<L>With blood of brother &s;pilt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To pri&s;on dire misfortunes oft</L>
<L>The guiltle&s;s debtor bring;</L>
<L>Yet oft'ner far it will be found</L>
<L>His Woes from WHISKEY &s;pring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the pale Manufact'rer there,</L>
<L>How lank and lean he lies!</L>
<L>How haggard is his &s;ickly cheek!</L>
<L>How dim his hollow eyes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He plied the loom with good &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>His wages &s;till were high;</L>
<L>Twice what the village lab'rer gains,</L>
<L>His ma&s;ter did &s;upply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No book-debts kept him from his ca&s;h,</L>
<L>All paid as &s;oon as due;</L>
<L>His wages on the Saturday</L>
<L>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ail be never knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How amply had his gains &s;uffic'd,</L>
<L>On wife and children &s;pent!</L>
<L>But all mu&s;t for his plea&s;ure go;</L>
<L>All to the DRAM-SHOP went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See that Apprentice, young in years;</L>
<L>But hackney'd long in vice,</L>
<L>What made him rob his ma&s;ter's till?</L>
<L>Ah! WHISKEY did entice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That &s;erving Man&mdash;I knew him once,</L>
<L>So jaunty, &s;pruce, and &s;mart!</L>
<L>Why did he &s;teal, and pawn the plate?</L>
<L>'Twas WHISKEY &s;nar'd his heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn now mine eye where Channel-row,</L>
<L>Di&s;plays yon man&s;ion drear,</L>
<L>And a&s;k each pale and &s;hiv'ring wretch,</L>
<L>What mi&s;ery drove him there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! woeful &s;ight, &s;ay what cou'd cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Such poverty and &s;hame?</L>
<L>Hark! hear his words, he owns the cau&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>It all from WHISKEY came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when the future Lot is fix'd,</L>
<L>Of darkne&s;s, fire and chains,</L>
<L>How can the Drunkard hope to '&s;cape</L>
<L>Tho&s;e everla&s;ting pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since all his claim to heaven he &s;ells</L>
<L>And drink the be&s;tial cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Rejects the price his Saviour paid,</L>
<L>And di&s;obeys his laws,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For if the Murd'rer's doom'd to woe,</L>
<L>As holy writ declares,</L>
<L>The Drunkard with SELF Murderers</L>
<L>That dreadful Portion &s;hares.</L>
