<P>The recollection of a friend's having witne&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t dawnings of my poetical and mu&s;ical ideas&mdash;his kind partiality to them&mdash;his friend&s;hip and liberality in promoting a &s;cheme for my benefit&mdash;his hand&s;ome con|duct in forgetting that, at the in&s;tigation of unprin|cipled men, I believed him to have been unfaithful to his promi&s;es: In fine, the variety of in&s;tances in which he has proved him&s;elf &s;uch a friend as no man but my&s;elf could ever boa&s;t of:&mdash;</P>

<P>So well, however, do I know you, that you will wonder I &s;hould conceive it nece&s;&s;ary to mention tho&s;e kindne&s;&s;es as a favour which you conferred for your own gratification.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>So many opinions have been hazarded, by cavillers, on the &s;ubject of the following &s;ongs, that it would be almo&s;t a tacit acquie&s;cence in the folly, ignorance, and ab&s;urdity of &s;uch opinions, were I to do my&s;elf and the public &s;o much inju&s;tice as to let this oppor|tunity pa&s;s without giving them their merited no|tice.</P>
<P>Were I di&s;po&s;ed to plea&s;antry, I might &s;ay with my Iri&s;hman, that <Q REND="inline">"the proper notice would be no notice at all:"</Q>&mdash;and, indeed, were it not for the &s;ake of &s;imple truth and common ju&s;tice, &s;uch calum|niators might as well pa&s;s unregarded; for envy is as natural to dunces as hunger, and what &s;hould they &s;eek to &s;atisfy but the cravings of their appetites?</P>
<P>As, however, there is &s;omething &s;eriou&s;ly material in attending to whatever in the &s;lighte&s;t degree re|gards the public, I &s;hall go a little into this bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="ii" REF="9">
if it be only to &s;hew how tiny and ineffectual are the yelpings of the&s;e literary curs, who, like true mon|grels, never open but to do mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that, throughout my whole public career, I have been nibbled at the heel by the&s;e mon|grels of the mu&s;es, the&s;e &s;linking &s;narlers, who, the rever&s;e of the dogs that guarded the fane of Diana, fawn upon vice, and cheri&s;h every thing but virtue.</P>
<P>When I compo&s;ed the mu&s;ic of the Padlock, the cry was that I employed &s;ome Italian, for fifty pounds, to do that of which I was incapable. I &s;miled with contempt at the rumour, and the public very &s;oon did me ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>After this I had the temerity to write for my&s;elf. The villany of &s;uch an action was unpardonable; and it was immediately re&s;olved to brand me with an a&s;|per&s;ion as fal&s;e as it was invidious. Here I was obliged to a&s;&s;ert my claim to a public hearing; and the con&s;equence was, the town cho&s;e to allow that I
<PB N="iii" REF="10">
had as much right as any other per&s;on to the privi|leges of a &s;ubject, and the feelings of a man.</P>
<P>This terrible di&s;appointment to the &s;narlers awed them into a kind of &s;ulky growl, which has never &s;ince broke out but very partially; and as petulance and &s;orene&s;s generally interpret every thing the wrong way, and defeat their own ends, &s;o the malig|nity of their &s;arca&s;ms have not been more remarkable than their folly. They have attributed my &s;ea &s;ongs to men who knew no more of nautical terms than an Engli&s;h &s;ailor does of art or hypocri&s;y; they have made more blunders in detecting my Iri&s;h &s;ongs than the &s;ongs contain them&s;elves; and in the inve&s;tigation of my hunting &s;ongs they have been perpetually at fault.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, one evening, dropt in at a coffee-hou&s;e where a number of the&s;e literary jurymen were holding an inque&s;t over my murdered reputation.&mdash;He humoured the je&s;t, and, before he had fini&s;hed, proved, to the &s;atisfaction of every one pre&s;ent, that
<PB N="iv" REF="11">
Poor Jack was a po&s;thumous work of Dr. John&s;on, that the Race Hor&s;e was written by the jockey who rode the famous Flying Childers, and that Blow high Blow low was the production of Admiral Keppel, who dictated the words to his &s;ecretary as he lay in his cot, after the memorable battle of the twenty-&s;eventh of July, waiting for the French to try their force with him hand&s;omely the next morning.</P>
<P>But the mi&s;chief of it is, the&s;e poor devils cannot di&s;cern that all they do to injure me gives me real con&s;equence. The public are always &s;ure to take up a man at whom the &s;hafts of rancour are levelled.&mdash;If his efforts be nothing more than inoffen&s;ive, he is &s;ecure of protection in favour of his intentions; if meritorious, they know too well their own dignity not to rank him according to his de&s;erts.</P>
<P>To that public I would make a &s;olemn declaration that I am the &s;ole author of every thing this book contains, but that they too well know the hue of truth
<PB N="v" REF="12">
to need an elucidation of it by any light I can place it in.</P>
<P>As however I do not wi&s;h to cru&s;h this vermin&mdash;on the contrary, I would have them crawl and nibble, for vermin are as nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;y&s;tem of literature as in the &s;y&s;tem of the creation&mdash;I am willing to allow that there are plenty of faults in this work.</P>
<P>Yet, le&s;t &s;uch reptiles &s;hould extend any fang with plea&s;ure at the&s;e delicious tidings, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that I could very often have written better had it not been for mu&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, precludes nerve, and, in others, requires it, when the rever&s;e would probably have made the poetry read better.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations are very &s;afe with the public at large, to whom I never can addre&s;s my&s;elf without confe&s;&s;ing more incapacity of expre&s;&s;ion than is attributed to me by the &s;ourne&s;s of my heart-burnt enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="13">
To the&s;e poor creatures, did I wi&s;h their de&s;erts, I &s;hould be more cruel and injurious than they have it in their power to be to me.</P>

<L>THERE was a miller's daughter</L>
<L>Liv'd in a certain village,</L>
<L>Who made a mighty &s;laughter:&mdash;</L>
<L>For I'd have you to know,</L>
