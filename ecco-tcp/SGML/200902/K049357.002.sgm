<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>We depart for Europe&mdash;a mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;es between the captain and &s;urgeon, through the &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions of Cramp|ley&mdash;the captain dies&mdash;Crampley tyran|nizes over the &s;urgeon, who falls a victim to his cruelty&mdash;I am al&s;o ill u&s;ed&mdash;the &s;hip &s;trikes&mdash;the behaviour of Crampley and the &s;eamen on that occa&s;ion.&mdash;I get on &s;hore, challenge the captain to &s;ingle combat&mdash;am treacherou&s;ly knocked down, wounded and robbed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOW that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I felt exce&s;|&s;ive plea&s;ure in finding my&s;elf out of &s;ight of that fatal i&s;land, which has been the grave of
<PB N="2" REF="14">
&s;o many Europeans; and as I was accommoda|ted with every thing to render the pa&s;&s;age agree|able, I re&s;olved to enjoy my&s;elf as much as the in&s;olence of Crampley would permit.&mdash;This in|&s;idious &s;landerer had found means already to cau&s;e a mi&s;under&s;tanding between the &s;urgeon and captain, who by his age and infirmities was ren|dered intolerably peevi&s;h, his di&s;po&s;ition having al&s;o been &s;owred by a long cour&s;e of di&s;appointments, and had a particular aver&s;ion to all young men, e&s;pecially to &s;urgeons, whom he con&s;idered as un|nece&s;&s;ary animals on board of a &s;hip.&mdash;In con|&s;equence of the&s;e &s;entiments, he never con&s;ulted the doctor, notwith&s;tanding his being &s;eized with a violent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a ca&s;k of Holland-gin, which was his &s;overeign pre&s;cription again&s;t all di&s;tempers: But whether he was at this time too &s;paring, or took an over|do&s;e of his cordial, certain it is, he departed in the night, without any ceremony, which indeed was a thing he always de&s;pi&s;ed, and was found &s;tiff, next morning, to the no &s;mall &s;atisfaction of Crampley, who &s;ucceeded to the command of the ve&s;&s;el.&mdash;For that very rea&s;on, Mr. Tomlins and I had no cau&s;e to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new commander would now be as unlimited as his power.&mdash;The fir&s;t day of his command ju&s;tified our apprehen&s;ion: For on pretence that the decks were too much crowded, he ordered the &s;urgeon's hen-coops, with all his fowls, to be thrown over-board; and at the &s;ame time, prohibited him and me from appearing on the quarter-deck. Mr. Tomlins could not help complaining of the&s;e injuries, and in the cour&s;e of his expo&s;tulation dropped &s;ome ha&s;ty words, of which Crampley taking hold,
<PB N="3" REF="15">

<P>Nothing but a &s;peedy deliverance could have &s;upported me under the brutal &s;way of this ba|&s;haw; who to render my life the more irk&s;ome, &s;ignified to my me&s;s-mates, a de&s;ire that I &s;hould be expelled from their &s;ociety.&mdash;This was no &s;ooner hinted, than they granted his reque&s;t; and I was fain to eat in a &s;olitary manner by my&s;elf during the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;age, which however &s;oon drew to a period.</P>
<P>We had been &s;even weeks at &s;ea, when the gunner told the captain, that by his reckoning we mu&s;t be in &s;oundings, and de&s;ired he would order the lead to be heaved.&mdash;Crampley &s;wore, he did not know how to keep the &s;hip's way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of &s;ound|ings, and therefore he would not give him&s;elf the trouble to ca&s;t the lead.&mdash;Accordingly, we con|tinued

our cour&s;e all that afternoon and night, without &s;hortening &s;ail, although the gunner pre|tended to di&s;cover Scilly light; and next morning prote&s;ted in form again&s;t the captain's conduct; for which he was put in confinement.&mdash;We di&s;|covered no land all that day, and Crampley was &s;till &s;o infatuated as to neglect &s;ounding: But at three o' clock in the morning, the &s;hip &s;truck, and remained fa&s;t on a &s;and bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was imme|diately hoi&s;ted out, but as we could not di&s;cern which way the &s;hore lay, we were obliged to wait for day-light. In the mean time, the wind in|crea&s;ed, and the waves beat again&s;t the &s;loop with &s;uch violence, that we expected &s;he would have gone to pieces. The gunner was relea&s;ed and con&s;ulted: He advi&s;ed the captain to cut a|way the ma&s;t, in order to lighten her; this was performed without &s;ucce&s;s: The &s;ailors &s;eeing things in a de&s;perate &s;ituation, according to cu&s;tom, broke up the che&s;ts belonging to the officers, dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in their cloaths, drank their liquors without ceremony; and drunken|ne&s;s, tumult, and confu&s;ion en&s;ued.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this uproar, I went below to &s;ecure my own effects; and found the carpenter's mate he wing down the pur&s;er's cabbin with his hatchet, whi&s;tling all the while, with great compo&s;ure. When I a&s;ked his intention in &s;o doing, he re|plied very calmly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I only want to ta&s;te the pur&s;er's rum, that's all, ma&s;ter."&mdash;</Q>At that in&s;tant the pur&s;er coming down, and &s;eeing his effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of the inju&s;tice done to him, and a&s;ked the fellow what occa&s;ion he had for liquor, when in all likelihood he would be in eternity in a few mi|nutes.

So &s;aying, I leaped with my full exertion, and got on board of the boat with the lo&s;s of the &s;kin of one of my &s;hins.&mdash;I chanced in my de&s;cent to overturn Crampley, who no &s;ooner got up than he &s;truck at me &s;eve|ral times with a cutla&s;s, and ordered the men to

<P>BUT as I lay ruminating, my pa&s;&s;ion in&s;en&s;i|bly abated; I con&s;idered my &s;ituation in quite another light from that in which it appeared to me at fir&s;t, and the re&s;ult of my deliberation was to get up if I could, and crawl to the next inhabited place for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;With &s;ome diffi|culty I got upon my legs, and having examined my body, found I had received no other injury than two large contu&s;ed wounds, one on the

I looked towards the &s;ea, but could di&s;cern no remains of the &s;hip; which made me conclude &s;he had gone to pieces, and that tho&s;e who remained in her had peri&s;hed: But, as I afterwards learned, the gunner, who had more &s;agacity than Crampley, ob&s;erving that it was flood when we left her, and that &s;he would po&s;&s;ibly float at high-water, made no noi&s;e about getting on &s;hore, but con|tinued on deck, in hopes of bringing her &s;afe in|to &s;ome barbour, after the commander had de|&s;erted her, for which he expected, no doubt, to be hand&s;omely rewarded.&mdash;This he accordingly performed, and was promi&s;ed great things by the admiralty for &s;aving his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip; but I never heard he reaped the fruits of his expecta|tion.&mdash;As for my own part, I directed my cour&s;e towards a &s;mall cottage I perceived, and in the road picked up a &s;ea-man's old jacket, which I &s;uppo&s;e the thief who dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in my cloaths, had thrown away; this was a very com|fortable acqui&s;ition to me, who was almo&s;t &s;tiff with cold: I therefore put it on, and as my na|tural heat revived, my wounds, which had left off bleeding, bur&s;t out afre&s;h; &s;o that finding my|&s;elf exce&s;&s;ively exhau&s;ted, I was about to lie down in the fields, when I di&s;covered a barn on my left hand, within a few yards of me; thi|ther I made &s;hift to &s;tagger, and finding the door open, went in, but &s;aw no body; upon which I threw my&s;elf upon a tru&s;s of &s;traw, hoping to be &s;oon relieved by &s;ome per&s;on or other.&mdash;I had not lain here many minutes, when I &s;aw a country|man come in with a pitch-fork in his hand,

and they continued a good while in the agonies of fear.&mdash;At length the father propo&s;ed, that the &s;on &s;hould draw nearer and take a more di&s;tinct view of the apparition; but Dick was of opinion that his father &s;hould advance fir&s;t, as being an old man pa&s;t his labour, and if he re|ceived any mi&s;chief, the lo&s;s would be the &s;maller; whereas he him&s;elf might e&s;cape, and be u&s;eful in his generation.&mdash;This prudential rea&s;on had no effect upon the &s;enior, who &s;till kept Dick between me and him.&mdash;In the mean time I en|deavoured to rai&s;e one hand as a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, but had only &s;trength &s;ufficient to cau&s;e a ru&s;tling among the &s;traw, which di&s;compo&s;ed the young pea&s;ant &s;o much, that he &s;prung out at the door, and overthrew his father in his flight.&mdash;The old gentleman would not &s;pend time in getting up, but crawled backwards like a crab, with great &s;peed, till he had got over the thre&s;hold, mum|bling exorci&s;ms all the way.&mdash;I was exceedingly mortified to find my&s;elf in danger of peri&s;hing through the ignorance and cowardice of the&s;e clowns; and felt my &s;pirits decay apace, when an old woman entered the barn, followed by the two fugitives, and with great intrepidity ad|vanced to the place where I lay, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If it be the devil I fearen not, and for a dead mon a can do us no harm."&mdash;</Q>When &s;he &s;aw my condition, &s;he cried <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here be no devil, but in youren fool's head.&mdash;Here be a poor mi&s;erable wretch, bleeding to death, and if he dies, we mu&s;t be at the charge of burying him; there|fore Dick, go vetch the old wheel-barrow and puten in, and carry him to good-man Hodge's back-door, he is more eable than we to lay out money upon poor vagrants."&mdash;</Q>

Her advice was taken, and immediately put in execution: I was rolled to the other farmer's door, where I was tumbled out like a heap of dung; and would certainly have fallen a prey to the hogs, if my groans had not di&s;turbed the family, and brought &s;ome of them out to view my &s;ituation.&mdash;But Hodge re&s;embled the Jew more than the good Samaritan, and ordered me to be carried to the hou&s;e of the par&s;on, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to practi&s;e as well as to preach charity: ob&s;erving that it was &s;ufficient for him to pay his <HI>quota</HI> toward the maintenance of the poor belonging to his own pari&s;h.&mdash;When I was &s;et down at the vicar's gate, he fell into a migh|ty pa&s;&s;ion, and threatned to excommunicate him who &s;ent as well as tho&s;e who brought me, un|le&s;s they would move me immediately to ano|ther place.&mdash;About this time I fainted with the fatigue I had undergone, and afterwards under|&s;tood that I was bandied from door to door through a whole village, no body having huma|nity enough to admini&s;ter the lea&s;t relief to me, until an old woman, who was &s;u&s;pected of witch|craft by the neighbourhood, hearing of my di&s;tre&s;s, received me into her hou&s;e, and having dre&s;&s;ed my wounds, brought me to my&s;elf with cordials of her own preparing.&mdash;I was treated with great care and tenderne&s;s by this grave matron, who, after I had recovered &s;ome &s;trength, de&s;ired to know the particulars of my la&s;t di&s;a&s;ter.&mdash;This piece of &s;atisfaction I could not refu&s;e to one who had &s;aved my life, therefore related all my adventures without exaggeration or re&s;erve.

<P>FRAUGHT with the&s;e u&s;eful in&s;tructions, I repaired to the place of her habitation, and was introduced by the waiting-woman, to the pre&s;ence of my lady, who had not before &s;een me.&mdash;She &s;at in her &s;tudy, with one foot on the ground, and the other upon a high &s;tool at &s;ome di&s;tance from her &s;eat; her &s;andy locks hung down in a di&s;order I cannot call beautiful from her head, which was deprived of its coif, for the benefit of &s;cratching with one hand, while &s;he held the &s;tump of a pen in the other.&mdash;Her fore-head was high and wrinkled, her eyes large, grey and prominent; her no&s;e long, &s;harp and aquiline; her mouth of va&s;t capacity; her vi&s;age meagre and freckled, and her chin peeked like a &s;hoemaker's paring-knife: Her upper-lip contained a large quantity of plain Spani&s;h, which by continual falling, had embroidered her neck

that was not naturally very white, and the brea&s;t of her gown, that flowed loo&s;e about her with a negligence truly poetic, di&s;covering linen that was very fine and to all appearance, never <HI>wa&s;h|ed but in Ca&s;talian &s;treams.</HI>&mdash;Around her lay heaps of books, globes, quadrants, tele&s;copes, and other learned apparatus: Her &s;nuff-box &s;tood at her right hand, at her left lay her handker|chief &s;ufficiently u&s;ed, and a convenience to &s;pit in appeared on one &s;ide of her chair.&mdash;Being in a reverie when we entered, the maid did not think proper to di&s;turb her; &s;o that we waited &s;ome minutes unob&s;erved, during which time, &s;he bit the quill &s;everal times, altered her po&s;ition, made many wry faces, and at length, with an air of triumph, repeated aloud;<Q><L>"Nor dare th' immortal Gods my rage oppo&s;e!"</L></Q></P>
<P>Having committed her &s;ucce&s;s to paper, &s;he turned toward the door, and perceiving us, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What's the matter?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here's the young man (replied my conductre&s;s) whom Mrs. Sagely recommended as a footman to your lady&s;hip."</Q> On this information, &s;he &s;tared in my face a con&s;iderable time, and then a&s;ked my name, which I thought proper to conceal under that of John Brown.&mdash;After having &s;urveyed me with a curious eye, &s;he broke out into <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O! ay, thou wa'&s;t &s;hipwrecked I remember.&mdash;Whether did&s;t thou come on &s;hore on the back of a whale or a dolphin?"</Q> To this I an|&s;wered, I had &s;wam a&s;hore without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Then &s;he demanded to know if I had ever been at the Helle&s;pont, and &s;wam from Se&s;tos to Abydos.

<PB N="21" REF="33">
countenance and carriage of this amiable appari|tion, that my heart was captivated at fir&s;t &s;ight, and while dinner la&s;ted I gazed upon her without intermi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Her age &s;eemed to be &s;eventeen, her &s;tature tall, her &s;hape unexcep|tionable, her hair, that fell down upon her ivory neck in ringlets, black as jet; her arched eye|brows of the &s;ame colour; her eyes piercing, yet tender; her lips of the con&s;i&s;tence and hue of cherries; her complexion clear, delicate and healthy; her a&s;pect noble, ingen'ous and hu|mane; and the whole &s;o ravi&s;hingly delightful, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any creature, endued with &s;en&s;ibility, to &s;ee without admiring, and ad|mire without loving her to exce&s;s! How often did I cur&s;e the &s;ervile &s;tation, that placed me &s;o infinitely beneath the regard of this idol of my adoration! and how often did I ble&s;s my fate, that enabled me to enjoy daily the &s;ight of &s;o much perfection! When &s;he &s;poke, I li&s;tened with plea&s;ure; but when &s;he &s;poke to me, my &s;oul was thrilled with an ex&s;ta&s;y of tumultuous joy!

made &s;hift to &s;wim to the &s;hore, where my com|panions, after having overpowered me, &s;tript me to the &s;hirt, and left me, as they imagined, dead of the wounds I received in my own de|fence: Then I related the circum&s;tances of my being found in a barn, with the inhuman treat|ment I met with from the country people and par&s;on; which I perceived, drew tears from the charming creature's eyes!

<P>The conver&s;ation, among other &s;ubjects, turned upon the young 'Squire, whom my lady enquired after, under the title of the Savage; and was in|formed by her niece, that he was &s;till in bed, re|pairing the fatigue of la&s;t night's debauch, and recruiting &s;trength and &s;pirits to undergo a fox|chace to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Timothy Thicket, 'Squire Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the &s;ame &s;tamp, whom he had invited on that occa&s;ion; &s;o that by day|break, the whole hou&s;e would be in an uproar.&mdash;This was a very di&s;agreeable piece of news to the <HI>virtuo&s;i,</HI> who prote&s;ted &s;he would &s;tuff her ears with cotton when &s;he went to bed, and take a do&s;e of opium to make her &s;leep the more &s;ound, that &s;he might not be di&s;turbed and di&s;tracted by the clamour of the brutes.</P>
<P>When their dinner was over, I and my fellow|&s;ervants &s;at down to ours in the kitchen, where I under&s;tood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy knight in the neighbourhood, between whom and Narci&s;&s;a a match had been projected

<P>Narci&s;&s;a being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is re&s;cued by me, who revenge my&s;elf on my rival&mdash;I declare my pa&s;|&s;ion, and retreat to the &s;ea-&s;ide&mdash;I am &s;urrounded by &s;mugglers, and carried to Bulloign&mdash;I find my uncle lieutenant Bowling, in great di&s;tre&s;s, and relieve him&mdash;our conver&s;ation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT certain intervals, my ambition would re|vive; I would de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf for my tame re&s;ignation to my &s;ordid fate, and revolve an hundred &s;chemes for a&s;&s;uming the character of a gentleman, to which I was intitled by birth and education.&mdash;In the&s;e fruitle&s;s &s;ugge&s;tions, time &s;tole away unperceived, and I had already re|mained eight months in the &s;tation of a foot|man, when an accident happened, that put an end to my &s;ervitude, and for the pre&s;ent bani&s;hed all hopes of &s;ucceeding in my love.</P>
<P>Narci&s;&s;a went one day to vi&s;it Mi&s;s Thicket, who lived with her brother, within le&s;s than a mile of our hou&s;e, and was per&s;uaded to walk home in the cool of the evening, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who having a good deal of the brute in him, was in&s;tigated to u&s;e &s;ome unbe|coming familiarities with her, encouraged by the &s;olitarine&s;s of a field through which they pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;The lovely creature was incen&s;ed at his rude behaviour, for which &s;he reproached him in &s;uch
<PB N="36" REF="48">
a manner, that he lo&s;t all regard for decency, and actually offered violence to this pattern of innocence and beauty.&mdash;But heaven would not &s;uffer &s;o much goodne&s;s to be violated; and &s;ent me, who pa&s;&s;ing by accident near the place, was alarmed with her cries, to her &s;uccour.&mdash;What were the emotions of my &s;oul, when I beheld Narci&s;&s;a, almo&s;t &s;inking beneath the brutal force of this &s;atyr! I flew like lightening to her re&s;cue, which he perceiving, quitted his prey, and drew his hanger to cha&s;ti&s;e my pre&s;umption.&mdash;My indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear, &s;o that ru&s;hing upon him, I &s;truck his weapon out of his hand, and u&s;ed my cudgel &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all appearance, without &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Then I turned to Narci&s;&s;a, who had &s;wooned, and &s;it|ting down by her, gently rai&s;ed her head, and &s;upported it on my bo&s;om, while with my hand around her wai&s;t, I kept her in that po&s;ition. My &s;oul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling the object of my deare&s;t wi&s;hes within my arms; and while &s;he lay in&s;en&s;ible, I could not refrain from applying my cheek to her's, and ravi&s;hing a ki&s;s: In a little time, the blood began to re|vi&s;it her face, &s;he opened her enchanting eyes, and having recollected her late &s;ituation, &s;aid, with a look full of tender acknowledgment, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear John, I am eternally obliged to you!"</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he made an effort to ri&s;e, in which I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and &s;he proceeded to the hou&s;e, lean|ing upon me all the way. I was a thou&s;and times tempted by this opportunity to declare my pa&s;&s;ion, but the dread of di&s;obliging her, re&s;train|ed my tongue. We had not got an hundred paces from the &s;cene of her di&s;tre&s;s, when I per|ceived
<PB N="37" REF="49">
Sir Timothy get up and move homeward; a circum&s;tance, which, though it gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction, in as much as I thereby knew I had not killed him, filled me with ju&s;t apprehen|&s;ion of his re&s;entment, which I found my&s;elf in no condition to with&s;tand: e&s;pecially when I con&s;idered his intimacy with our 'Squire, to whom I knew he would ea&s;ily ju&s;tify him&s;elf for what he had done, by imputing it to his love, and de|&s;iring his brother Bruin to take the &s;ame liberty with his &s;i&s;ter, without any fear of offence.&mdash;When we arrived at the hou&s;e, Narci&s;&s;a a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he would exert all her influence in protect|ing me from the revenge of Thicket, and like|wi&s;e engage her aunt in my favour. At the &s;ame time, pulling out her pur&s;e, offered it as a &s;mall con&s;ideration for the &s;ervice I had done her.&mdash;But I &s;tood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of being merce|nary, and refu&s;ed the pre&s;ent, &s;aying, I had me|rited nothing by barely doing my duty.&mdash;She &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and blu&s;hed: I felt the &s;ame &s;uffu&s;ion, and with a down-ca&s;t eye and broken accent, told her, I had one reque&s;t to make, which if her genero|&s;ity would grant, I &s;hould think my&s;elf fully re|compen&s;ed for an age of mi&s;ery.&mdash;She changed colour at this preamble, and with great confu&s;ion, replied, &s;he hoped my good &s;en&s;e would hinder me from a&s;king any thing &s;he was bound in ho|nour to refu&s;e, and therefore bid me &s;ignify my de&s;ire.&mdash;Upon which I kneeled, and begged to ki&s;s her hand. She immediately, with an averted look, &s;tretched it out; I imprinted on it an ar|dent ki&s;s, and bathing it with my tears, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentle|man,

When &s;he un|der&s;tood my &s;ituation, the good woman, with real concern, condoled me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my re&s;olution to leave the coun|try, being perfectly well acquainted with the bar|barous di&s;po&s;ition of my rival, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who by this time (&s;aid &s;he) has no doubt mediated a &s;cheme of revenge.&mdash;Indeed, I cannot &s;ee how you will be able to elude his vengeance: be|ing him&s;elf in the commi&s;&s;ion, he will im|mediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and as almo&s;t all the people in this coun|try are dependant on him or his friend, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to find &s;helter a|mong them: If you &s;hould be apprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may po&s;&s;ibly langui&s;h in great mi&s;ery till the next a&s;&s;izes, and then be tran&s;ported for a&s;&s;aulting a magi&s;trate."&mdash;</Q>While &s;he thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door, which threw us both into great con&s;ternation, as in all probability, it was occa&s;ioned by my pur&s;uers; whereupon this generous old lady, put|ting two guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes, bid me, for God's &s;ake, get out at the back

door, and con&s;ult my &s;afety as providence &s;hould direct me.&mdash;There was no time for deliberation.&mdash;I followed her advice, and e&s;caped by the be|nefit of a dark night, to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where while I ruminated on my next excur&s;ion, I was all of a &s;udden &s;urrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bid me make no noi&s;e, on pain of being &s;hot, and carried me on board of a ve&s;&s;el, which I &s;oon perceived to be a &s;muggling cutter.&mdash;This di&s;covery gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction at fir&s;t, becau&s;e I concluded my&s;elf &s;afe from the re&s;entment of Sir Timothy: But when I found my&s;elf in the hands of ruf|fians, who threatned to execute me for a &s;py, I would have thought my&s;elf happily quit for a year's impri&s;onment, or even tran&s;portation.&mdash;It was in vain for me to prote&s;t my innocence: I could not per&s;uade them that I had taken a &s;o|litary walk to their haunt, at &s;uch an hour, mere|ly for my own amu&s;ement; and I did not think it my intere&s;t to di&s;clo&s;e the true cau&s;e of my re|treat, becau&s;e I was afraid they would have made their peace with ju&s;tice by &s;urrendering me to the penalty of the law.&mdash;What confirmed their &s;u&s;picion was, the appearance of a Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e yacht, which gave them chace, and had well-nigh made a prize of their ve&s;&s;el; when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which effectually &s;creened them, and favoured their arrival at Buloign.&mdash;But before they got out of &s;ight of their pur&s;uer, they held a council of war about me, whom &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;erocious a|mong them, would have thrown overboard, as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies; but others more con&s;iderate, alledged, that if they put me to death, and &s;hould afterwards be

taken, they could expect no mercy from the legi&s;lature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder.&mdash;It was therefore deter|mined by a plurality of votes, that I &s;hould be &s;et on &s;hore in France, and left to find my pa&s;&s;age back to England, as I &s;hould think pro|per, which would be puni&s;hment &s;ufficient for the bare &s;u&s;picion of a crime in it&s;elf not capital.&mdash;Although this favourable determination gave me great plea&s;ure, the apprehen&s;ion of being robbed would not &s;uffer me to be perfectly at ea&s;e: To prevent this calamity, as &s;oon as I was untied, in con&s;equence of the fore&s;aid deci&s;ion, I tore a &s;mall hole in one of my &s;tockings, into which I dropped &s;ix guineas, re&s;erving half a piece and &s;ome &s;ilver in my pocket, that finding &s;omething, they might not be tempted to make any further in|quiry.&mdash;This was a very nece&s;&s;ary precaution, for when we came within &s;ight of the French &s;hore, one of the &s;mugglers told me, I mu&s;t pay for my pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;To this I replied, that my pa&s;&s;age was none of my own &s;eeking; therefore they could not expect a reward from me for tran&s;port|ing me into a &s;trange country by force.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dam|me! (&s;aid the outlaw) none of your palaver; but let me &s;ee what money you have got."&mdash;</Q>So &s;aying, he thru&s;t his hand into my pocket without any ceremony, and emptied it of the con|tents: Then ca&s;ting an eye at my hat and wig, which captivated his fancy, he took them off, and clap|ping his own on my head, declared, that a fair exchange was no robbery.&mdash;I was fain to put up with the bargain, which was by no means favour|able to me; and a little while after we went all on &s;hore together.</P>

I re&s;olved to take my leave of the&s;e de&s;pera|does, without much ceremony, when one of them cautioned me again&s;t appearing to their prejudice if ever I returned to England, un|le&s;s I had a mind to be murdered; for which &s;ervice, he a&s;&s;ured me, the gang never wanted agents.&mdash;I promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve his advice, and departed for the Upper Town, where I enquired for a cabaret or publick hou&s;e, into which I went, with an intention of taking &s;ome refre&s;hment.&mdash;In the kitchin, five Dutch &s;ailors &s;at at breakfa&s;t, with a large loaf, a &s;irkin of butter, and a cag of brandy on the table, the bung of which they often applied to their mouths with great per&s;eve|rance and &s;atisfaction.&mdash;At &s;ome di&s;tance from them, I perceived another per&s;on in the &s;ame garb, &s;itting in a pen&s;ive &s;olitary manner, enter|taining him&s;elf with a whiff of tobacco, from the &s;tump of a pipe, as black as jet.&mdash;The ap|pearance of di&s;tre&s;s never failed to attract my regard and compa&s;&s;ion; I approached this forlorn tar, with a view to offer him my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and notwith&s;tanding the alteration of dre&s;s, and di&s;|gui&s;e of a long beard, I di&s;covered in him my long lo&s;t and lamented uncle and benefactor, lieutenant Bowling!

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN our repa&s;t was ended, we walked down to the harbour, where we found a Cutter that was to &s;ail for Deal in the evening, and Mr. Bowling agreed for his pa&s;&s;age: In the mean time, we &s;auntered about the town, to &s;atisfy our curio&s;ity, our conver&s;ation turning on the &s;ubject of my de&s;igns, which were not as yet fixed: Neither can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that my mind was at ea&s;e, when I found my&s;elf reduced almo&s;t to extreme poverty, in the mid&s;t of fo|reigners, among whom I had not one acquain|tance to advi&s;e or befriend me.&mdash;My uncle was &s;en&s;ible of my forlorn condition, and pre&s;&s;ed me to accompany him to England, where he did not doubt of finding &s;ome &s;ort of provi&s;ion for me: But be&s;ides the other rea&s;ons I had for avoiding that kingdom, I looked upon it, at this time, as
<PB N="48" REF="60">
the wor&s;t country in the univer&s;e for a poor ho|ne&s;t man to live in; and therefore determined to remain in France, <HI>coute que coute.</HI>&mdash;I was con|firmed in this re&s;olution, by a reverend prie&s;t, who pa&s;&s;ing by at this time, and overhearing us &s;peak Engli&s;h, acco&s;ted us in the &s;ame language, telling us he was our countryman, and wi&s;hing it might be in his power to do us any &s;ervice: We thanked this grave per&s;on for his courteous offer, and invited him to drink a gla&s;s with us, which he did not think proper to refu&s;e, and we went all together into a tavern of his recommend|ing. After having drank to our healths in a bumper of good Burgundy, he began to enquire into our &s;ituation, and a&s;ked particularly the place of our nativity, which we no &s;ooner named, than he &s;tarted up, and wringing our hands with great fervour, &s;hed a flood of tears, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I come from the &s;ame part of the country! perhaps you are my own relations."&mdash;</Q>I was on my guard again&s;t his care&s;&s;es, which I &s;u&s;pected very much, when I remembred the adventure of the money-dropper; but without any appearance of diffidence, ob&s;erved, that as he was born in that part of the country, he mu&s;t certainly know our families, which (how&s;oever mean our pre&s;ent ap|pearance might be) were none of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and incon&s;iderable.&mdash;Then I di&s;covered our names, to which I found he was no &s;tranger; he had known my grandfather per&s;onally; and not|with&s;tanding an ab&s;ence of fifty years from Scot|land, recounted &s;o many particulars of the fami|lies in the neighbourhood, that my &s;cruples were entirely removed, and I thought my&s;elf happy in his acquaintance.&mdash;In the cour&s;e of our conver|&s;ation, I di&s;clo&s;ed my condition without re&s;erve,
<PB N="49" REF="61">
and di&s;played my talents to &s;uch advantage, that the old father looked upon me with admiration, and a&s;&s;ured me, that if I &s;tayed in France, and li&s;tened to rea&s;on, I could not fail of making my fortune, to which he would contribute all in his power.</P>
<P>My uncle began to be jealous of the prie&s;t's in&s;inuation, and very abruptly declared, that if ever I &s;hould renounce my religion, he would break off all connexion and corre&s;pondence with me; for it was his opinion, that no hone&s;t man would &s;werve from the principles in which he was bred, whether Turki&s;h, Prote&s;tant or Ro|man.&mdash;The father, affronted at this declaration, with great vehemence, began a long di&s;cour&s;e, &s;etting forth the danger of ob&s;tinacy, and &s;hut|ting one's eyes again&s;t the light: He &s;aid, that ignorance would be no plea towards ju&s;tification, when we had opportunities of being better in|formed; and that, if the minds of people had not been open to conviction, the Chri&s;tian reli|gion would not have been propagated in the world; and we &s;hould now be in a &s;tate of Pa|gan darkne&s;s and barbarity: He endeavoured to prove, by &s;ome texts of &s;cripture, and many quotations from the fathers, that the Pope was the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of St. Peter, and vicar of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that the church of Rome was the true, holy, catholick church; and that the prote&s;tant faith was an impious here&s;y, and damnable &s;chi&s;m, by which many milions of &s;ouls would &s;uffer ever|la&s;ting perdition.&mdash;When he had fini&s;hed his &s;er|mon, which I thought, he pronounced with more zeal than di&s;cretion, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to my uncle, and de&s;ired to know his objections to what had been &s;aid. The lieutenant, who&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="62">
attention had been wholly engro&s;&s;ed by his own affairs, took the pipe out of his mouth, and re|plied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for me, friend, d'ye &s;ee, I have no objection to what you &s;ay, it may be either true or fal&s;e, for what I know; I meddle with no body's affairs but my own; the gunner to his lin&s;tock, and the &s;teer&s;man to the helm, as the &s;aying is.&mdash;I tru&s;t to no creed but the compa&s;s, and do unto every man as I would be done by; &s;o that I defy the pope, the de|vil, and the pretender; and hope to be &s;aved as well as another."&mdash;</Q>This a&s;&s;ociation of per|&s;ons gave great offence to the friar, who prote&s;t|ed, in a mighty pa&s;&s;ion, that if Mr. Bowling had not been his countryman, he would have cau&s;ed him to be impri&s;oned for his in&s;olence.&mdash;I ventured to di&s;approve of my uncle's ra&s;hne&s;s, and appea&s;ed the old gentleman, by a&s;&s;uring him, there was no offence intended by my kin&s;man, who by this time, &s;en&s;ible of his error, &s;hook the injured party by the hand, and a&s;ked pardon for the freedom he had taken.&mdash;Matters being amicably compromi&s;ed, he invited us to come and &s;ee him in the afternoon at the convent to which he belonged, and took his leave for the pre&s;ent; when my uncle recommended it &s;trong|ly to me to per&s;evere in the religion of my fore|fathers, whatever advantages I might propo&s;e to my &s;elf by a change, which could not fail of di&s;gracing my&s;elf, and di&s;honouring my family.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured him no con&s;ideration &s;hould induce me to forfeit his friend&s;hip and good opinion, on that &s;core; at which he di&s;covered great &s;ati&s;|faction, and put me in mind of dinner, which we immediately be&s;poke, and when it was ready eat together.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="63">
I imagined my acquaintance with the Scotti&s;h Prie&s;t, if properly managed, might turn out to my advantage, and therefore re&s;olved to cultivate it as much as I could. With this view we vi&s;ited him at his convent, according to his invitation, where he treated us with wine and &s;weet-meats, and &s;hewed us every thing that was remarka|ble in the mona&s;tery.&mdash;Having been thus enter|tained, we took our leave, though not before I had promi&s;ed to &s;ee him next day; and the time fixed for my uncle's embarking being come, I accompanied him to the harbour, and &s;aw him on board.&mdash;We parted not without tears, after we had embraced and wi&s;hed one another all manner of pro&s;perity; and he intreated me to write to him often, directing to lieutenant Thomas Bowling, at the &s;ign of the Union flag, near the Hermitage, London.</P>
<P>I returned to the hou&s;e in which we had met, where I pa&s;&s;ed the night in a very &s;olitary man|ner, reflecting on the &s;everity of my fate, and endeavouring to project &s;ome likely &s;cheme of life for the future; but my invention failed me, I &s;aw nothing but un&s;urmountable difficulties in my way, and was ready to de&s;pair at the mi&s;erable pro&s;pect! That I might not, however, neglect any probable means, I got up in the morning, and went directly to the father, who&s;e advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance I implored.&mdash;He received me very kindly, and gave me to under&s;tand, that there was one way of life in which a per&s;on of my talents could not fail of making a great figure.&mdash;I gue&s;&s;ed his meaning, and told him once for all, I was fully determined again&s;t any alteration in point of re|ligion, therefore if his propo&s;al regarded the church, he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of
<PB N="52" REF="64">
explaining it. He &s;hook his head and &s;ighed, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah! &s;on, &s;on, what a glorious pro|&s;pect is here &s;poiled, by your &s;tubborn pre|judice! Suffer your&s;elf to be per&s;uaded by rea|&s;on, and con&s;ult your temporal welfare, as well as the concerns of your eternal &s;oul.&mdash;I can, by my intere&s;t, procure your admi&s;&s;ion as a noviciate into this convent, where I will &s;uperintend and direct you with a truly pater|nal affection."&mdash;</Q>Then he launched out into the prai&s;es of a mona&s;tic life, which no noi&s;e di&s;turbs, no cares mole&s;t, and no danger invades&mdash;where the heart is weaned from carnal at|tachments, the gro&s;&s;er appetites &s;ubdued and cha&s;ti&s;ed, and the &s;oul wafted to the divine re|gions of philo&s;ophy and truth, on the wings of &s;tudious contemplation.&mdash;But his eloquence was lo&s;t upon me, whom two con&s;iderations enabled to with&s;tand his temptations; namely, my pro|mi&s;e to my uncle, and my aver&s;ion to an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical life; for as to the difference of religion, I looked upon it as a thing of too &s;mall moment to come in competition with a man's fortune.&mdash;Finding me immoveable on this head, he told me, he was more &s;orry than offended at my non|compliance, and &s;till ready to employ his good of|fices in my behalf.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;ame erroneous ma|xims (&s;aid he) that ob&s;truct your promo|tion in the church, will infallibly prevent your advancement in the army; but if you can brook the condition of a &s;ervant, I am ac|quainted with &s;ome people of rank at Ver&s;ailles, to whom I can give you letters of recommen|dation, that you may be entertained by &s;ome one of them, in quality of <HI>maitre d' hotel;</HI> and I do not doubt that your qualifications

This piece of good news gave me infinite plea&s;ure; I acknowledged my obligation to the benevolent father, in the mo&s;t grateful expre&s;&s;ions; and he performed his pro|mi&s;e to a tittle, in delivering the letters, and making me acquainted with the capuchin, with whom I departed next morning by break of day.</P>
<P>It was not long before I di&s;covered my fellow|traveller to be a merry facetious fellow, who, not|with&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ion and appearance of mortification, loved good eating and drinking bet|ter than his ro&s;ary, and paid more adoration to a pretty girl than to the Virgin Mary, or St. Ge|nevive.&mdash;He was a thick brawny young man, with red eye-brows, a hook no&s;e, a face covered with freckles; and his name was Frere Balthazar. His order did not permit him to wear linnen, &s;o that having little occa&s;ion to undre&s;s him&s;elf, he was none of the cleanlie&s;t animals in the world; and his con&s;titution was naturally &s;o &s;trong &s;cent|ed, that I always thought it convenient to keep to the windward of him in our march.&mdash;As he was perfectly well known on the road, we fared &s;umptuou&s;ly without any co&s;t, and the fatigue of our journey was much alleviated by the good hu|mour of my companion, who &s;ung an infinite number of catches on the &s;ubjects of love and wine.&mdash;We took up our lodging the fir&s;t night
<PB N="54" REF="66">
at a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e, not far from Abbe Ville, where we were entertained with an excellent ragout, cooked by our landlord's daughters, one of whom was very hand&s;ome: After having eat heartily, and drank a &s;ufficient quantity of <HI>vin du Pais,</HI> we were conducted to a barn, where we found a couple of carpets &s;pread upon clean &s;traw for our reception.&mdash;We had not lain in this &s;ituation above half an hour, when we heard &s;omebody knock &s;oftly at the door, upon which Balthazar got up, and let in our ho&s;t's two daugh|ters, who wanted to have &s;ome private conver|&s;ation with him in the dark; when they had whi&s;pered together &s;ome time, the capuchin came to me, and a&s;ked if I was in&s;en&s;ible to love, or &s;o hard-hearted as to refu&s;e a &s;hare of my bed to a pretty maid, who had a <HI>tendre&s;&s;e</HI> for me.&mdash;I mu&s;t own, to my &s;hame, that I &s;uffered my|&s;elf to be overcome by my pa&s;&s;ion, and with great eagerne&s;s &s;eized the occa&s;ion, when I un|der&s;tood that the amiable Nanette was to be my bedfellow.&mdash;In vain did my rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;t the re|&s;pect I owed to my dear mi&s;tre&s;s Narci&s;&s;a; the idea of that lovely charmer, rather increa&s;ed than allayed the ferment of my &s;pirits; and the young Pai&s;anne had no rea&s;on to complain of my re|membrance.&mdash;Early in the morning, the kind creatures left us to our repo&s;e, which la&s;ted till eight o'clock, when we got up, and were treat|ed at breakfa&s;t with chocolate and <HI>l'eau de vie,</HI> by our paramours, of whom we took a tender leave, after my companion had confe&s;&s;ed and gi|ven them ab&s;olution.&mdash;While we proceeded on our journey, the conver&s;ation turned upon the night's adventure, being introduced by the capu|chin, who a&s;ked me how I liked my lodging:

I declared my &s;atisfaction, and talked in raptures of the agreeable Nanette; at which he &s;hook his head, and &s;miling &s;aid, &s;he was a <HI>mor&ccedil;eau pour la bonne bouche.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never valued my&s;elf (continued he) upon any thing &s;o much as the conque&s;t of Nanette; and, vanity apart, I have been pretty fortunate in my amours."&mdash;</Q>This in|formation &s;hocked me not a little, as I was well convinced of his intimacy with her &s;i&s;ter; and though I did not care to tax him with downright ince&s;t, I profe&s;&s;ed my a&s;toni&s;hment at his la&s;t night's choice, when, I &s;uppo&s;ed, the other was at his devotion.&mdash;To this he an&s;wered, that be|&s;ides his natural complai&s;ance to the &s;ex, he had another rea&s;on to di&s;tribute his favours equal|ly between them; namely, to pre&s;erve peace in the family, which could not otherwi&s;e be main|tained;&mdash;that moreover Nanette had conceived an affection for me, and he loved her too well to baulk her inclination; more e&s;pecially, when he had an opportunity of obliging his friend at the &s;ame time.&mdash;I thanked him for this in&s;tance of his friend&s;hip, though I was extremely di&s;|gu&s;ted at his want of delicacy, and cur&s;ed the oc|ca&s;ion that threw me in his way.&mdash;Libertine as I was, I could not bear to &s;ee a man behave &s;o wide of the character he a&s;&s;umed: I looked up|on him as per&s;on of very little worth or hone&s;ty, and &s;hould have even kept a wary eye upon my pocket, if I had thought he could have any temp|tation to &s;teal.&mdash;But I could not conceive the u&s;e of money to a capuchin, who is obliged, by the rules of his order, to appear like a beggar, and enjoys all other nece&s;&s;aries of life <HI>gratis;</HI> be&s;ides, my fellow-traveller &s;eemed to be of a complexion too carele&s;s and &s;anguine, to give me any apprehen&s;ion

I run down &s;tairs immediately; and with a look full of grief and amazement, enquired for the mendicant, who, they gave me to under&s;tand, had &s;et out four hours before, after having told them, I was a little indi&s;po&s;ed, and de&s;ired I might not be di&s;turbed, but be informed when I &s;hould wake he had ta|ken the road to Noyons, where he would wait for my coming, at the Coq D'Or.&mdash;I &s;poke not a word, but with a heavy heart, directed my cour&s;e to that place, at which I arrived in the af|ternoon, fainting with wearine&s;s and hunger; but learned, to my utter confu&s;ion, that no &s;uch per&s;on had been there!&mdash;It was happy for me that I had a good deal of re&s;entment in my con|&s;titution, which animated me on &s;uch occa&s;ions, again&s;t the villainy of mankind, and enabled me to bear misfortunes otherwi&s;e intolerable.&mdash;Boil|ing with indignation, I di&s;covered to the ho&s;t my deplorable condition, and inveighed with great bitterne&s;s again&s;t the treachery of Baltha|zar; at which he &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders, and with a peculiar grimace on his countenance, &s;aid, he was &s;orry for my misfortune; but there was no remedy like patience.&mdash;At that in&s;tant &s;ome gue&s;ts arrived, to whom he ha&s;tened to offer his &s;ervice, leaving me mortified at his indifference, and fully per&s;uaded that an inn-keeper is the &s;ame &s;ordid animal all over the world.&mdash;While I &s;tood in the porch, forlorn and undetermined, venting ejaculations of cur&s;es again&s;t the thief who had robbed me, and the old prie&s;t who re|commended

him to my friend&s;hip; a young gentleman richly dre&s;&s;ed, attended by a <HI>valet de chambre</HI> and two &s;ervants in livery, arrived at the inn. I thought I perceived a good deal of &s;weet|ne&s;s and good nature in his countenance; there|fore, he had no &s;ooner alighted than I acco&s;ted him, and in a few words explained my &s;ituation: He li&s;tened with great politene&s;s, and when I had made an end of my &s;tory, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, mon|&s;ieur, what would you have me do?"</Q> I was effectually aba&s;hed at this interrogation, which I believed no man of common &s;en&s;e or genero&s;ity could make, and made no other reply than a low bow: He returned the compliment &s;till lower, and tript into an apartment, while the landlord let me know, that my &s;tanding there to interrupt company gave offence, and might do him infinite prejudice.&mdash;He had no occa&s;ion to repeat his in&s;inu|ation; I moved from the place immediately; and was &s;o much tran&s;ported with grief, anger, and di&s;|dain, that a torrent of blood gu&s;hed from my no&s;trils.&mdash;In this exta&s;y, I quitted Noyons, and betook my&s;elf to the fields, where I wandered about like one di&s;tracted, till my &s;pirits were quite ex|hau&s;ted, and I was obliged to throw my&s;elf down at the root of a tree, to re&s;t my wearied limbs.&mdash;Here my rage for&s;ook me, I began to feel the importunate cravings of nature, and relap&s;ed in|to &s;ilent &s;orrow and melancholy reflection. I re|volved all the crimes I had been guilty of, and found them &s;o few and venial, that I could not comprehend the ju&s;tice of that providence, which after having expo&s;ed me to &s;o much wretched|ne&s;s and danger, left me a prey to famine at la&s;t in a foreign country, where I had not one friend or acquaintance to clo&s;e my eyes, and do the

la&s;t offices of humanity to my mi&s;erable carca&s;e.&mdash;A thou&s;and times I wi&s;hed my&s;elf a bear, that I might retreat to woods and de&s;arts, far from the inho&s;pitable haunts of man, where I could live by my own talents independant of treache|rous friends, and &s;upercilious &s;corn.</P>
<P>As I lay in this manner, groaning over my haple&s;s fate, I heard the &s;ound of a violin, and rai&s;ing my head, perceived a company of men and women dancing on the gra&s;s at &s;ome di&s;tance from me.&mdash;I looked upon this to be a favourable &s;ea&s;on for di&s;tre&s;s to attract compa&s;&s;ion, when e|very &s;elfi&s;h thought is bani&s;hed, and the heart dilated with mirth and &s;ocial joy; wherefore I got up and approached tho&s;e happy people, whom I &s;oon di&s;covered to be a party of &s;oldiers, with their wives and children, unbending and divert|ing them&s;elves at this rate, after the fatigue of a march.&mdash;I had never before &s;een &s;uch a parcel of &s;care-crows together, neither could I reconcile their meagre gaunt looks, their &s;qualid and ragged attire, and every other external &s;ymptom of ex|treme woe, with this appearance of fe&s;tivity.&mdash;I &s;aluted them however, and was received with great polite&s;&s;e; after which they formed a ring and danced around me.&mdash;This jollity had a won|derful effect upon my &s;pirits! I was infected with their gayety, and in &s;pite of my di&s;mal &s;ituation forgot my cares, and joined in their extravagance.&mdash;When we had recreated our&s;elves a good while at this diver&s;ion, the ladies &s;pread their manteaus on the ground, upon which they emptied their knap&s;acks of &s;ome onions, coar&s;e bread, and and few fla&s;ks of poor wine: Being invited to a &s;hare of the banquet, I &s;at down with the re&s;t, and in the whole cour&s;e of my life never made a

more comfortable meal.&mdash;When our repa&s;t was ended, we got up again to dance; and now that I found my&s;elf refre&s;hed, I behaved to the ad|miration of every body: I was loaded with a thou&s;and compliments, and profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip; the men commended my per&s;on and agility, and the women were loud in the prai&s;e of my <HI>bonne grace;</HI>&mdash;the &s;erjeant in particular, expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much regard for me, and de&s;cribed the agree|mens of a &s;oldier's life, with &s;o much art, that I began to li&s;ten to his propo&s;al of enli&s;ting me in the &s;ervice; and the more I con&s;idered my own condition, the more I was convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity I was under to come to a &s;peedy deter|mination.&mdash;Having therefore maturely weighed the circum&s;tances <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> I &s;ignified my con|&s;ent, and was admitted into the regiment of Pi|cardy, &s;aid to be the olde&s;t corps in Europe.&mdash;The company to which this command belonged, was quartered at a village not far off, whither we marched next day, and I was pre&s;ented to my captain, who &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and or|dered me to be accommodated with cloaths, arms and accoutrements.&mdash;Whereupon I &s;old my livery &s;uit, purcha&s;ed linnen, and as I was at great pains to learn the exerci&s;e, in a very &s;hort time be|came a compleat &s;oldier.</P>
<P>It was not long before we received orders to join &s;everal more regiments, and march with all expedition into Germany, in order to reinforce Marechal Duc de Noailles, who was then en|camped with his army on the &s;ide of the river Main, to watch the motions of the Engli&s;h, Au|&s;trians, and He&s;&s;ians, under the command of the earl of Stair. We began our march accordingly,

and then I became acquainted with that part of a &s;oldier's life to which I had been a &s;tranger hither|to:&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the hunger and thir&s;t I &s;u&s;tained, and the &s;atigue I underwent in a march of &s;o many hundred miles; during which, I was &s;o much cha&s;ed with the heat and motion of my limbs, that in a very &s;hort time the in&s;ide of my thighs and legs were deprived of &s;kin, and I proceeded in the utmo&s;t torture.&mdash;This misfor|tune I owed to the plumpne&s;s of my con&s;titution, which I cur&s;ed, and envied the withered con|dition of my comrades, who&s;e bodies could not &s;pare juice enough to &s;upply a common i&s;&s;ue, and were indeed proof again&s;t all manner of fric|tion. The continual pain I felt made me fretful, and my peevi&s;hne&s;s was increa&s;ed by the mortifi|cation of my pride in &s;eeing the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches, whom a hard gale of wind would have &s;cattered through the air like chaff, bear tho&s;e toils with alacrity, under which I was ready to &s;ink.</P>
<P>One day while we enjoyed a halt, and the &s;ol|diers with their wives had gone out to dance, ac|cording to cu&s;tom, my comrade &s;taid at home with me on pretence of friend&s;hip, and in&s;ulted me with his pity and con&s;olation! He told me, though I was young and tender at pre&s;ent, I would &s;oon be &s;ea&s;oned to the &s;ervice; and he did not doubt but I &s;hould have the honour to contribute in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the glory of the king.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Have courage, therefore, my child (&s;aid he) and pray to the good God, that you may be as happy as I am, who have had the honour of &s;erving Lewis the Great, and of re|ceiving many wounds in helping to e&s;tabli&s;h his glory."&mdash;</Q>When I looked upon the con|temptible

object that pronounced the&s;e words, I was amazed at the infatuation that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him; and could not help expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment at the ab&s;urdity of a rational being, who thinks him&s;elf highly honoured in being permitted to encounter abject poverty, oppre&s;&s;ion, famine, di&s;ea&s;e, mutilation, and evident death, merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince, by whom his &s;ufferings were di&s;regarded, and his name utterly unknown.&mdash;I ob&s;erved, that if his &s;ituation was the con&s;equence of compul&s;ion, as having been pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, I would prai&s;e his patience and fortitude in bearing his lot;&mdash;if he had taken up arms in defence of his in|jured country, he was to be applauded for his patrioti&s;m;&mdash;or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge from a greater evil, he was ju&s;tifiable in his own con&s;cience, (though I could have no notion of mi&s;ery more extreme than that he &s;uf|fered;) but to put his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his prince, was no more than profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a de&s;perate &s;lave, who voluntarily underwent the utmo&s;t wretched|ne&s;s and peril, and committed the mo&s;t flagrant crimes, to &s;ooth the barbarous pride of a fellow|creature, his &s;uperior in nothing but the power he derived from the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch wretches as he. The &s;oldier was very much affronted at the liberty I took with his king, which, he &s;aid, nothing but my ignorance could excu&s;e: He affirmed, that the characters of princes were &s;acred, and ought not to be profaned by the cen&s;ure of their &s;ubjects, who were bound by their allegiance to obey their commands, of what nature &s;oever, without &s;cruple or repining&mdash;And advi&s;ed me to correct the re|bellious principles I had imbibed among the

</LG></Q></P>
<P>In vindication of my countrymen, I adduced all the arguments commonly u&s;ed to prove that every man has a natural right to liberty; that al|legiance and protection are reciprocal; that when the mutual tie is broken by the tyranny of the king, he is accountable to the people for his breach of contract, and &s;ubject to the penalty of the law; and that tho&s;e in&s;urrections of the Engli&s;h, which are branded with the name of rebellion, by the &s;laves of arbitrary power, were no other than glorious efforts to re&s;cue that inde|pendance which was their birthright, from the ravenous claws of u&s;urping ambition.&mdash;The Frenchman, provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name, lo&s;t all patience, and re|proached me in &s;uch a manner, that my temper for&s;ook me, and I clenched my fi&s;t, with an in|tention to give him a hearty box on the ear.&mdash;Perceiving my de&s;ign, he &s;tarted back, and de|manded a parley; upon which I checked my in|dignation, and he gave me to under&s;tand that a Frenchman never forgave a blow; therefore if I was not weary of my life, I would do well to &s;pare him that mortification, and do him the ho|nour of mea&s;uring his &s;word with mine, like a gentleman.&mdash;I took his advice and followed him to a field hard by, where indeed I was a&s;hamed at the pitiful figure of my antagoni&s;t, who was a poor, little, &s;hivering creature decrepid with

age, and blind of one eye.&mdash;But I &s;oon found the folly of judging from appearances; being at the &s;econd pa&s;s wounded in the &s;word hand, and im|mediately di&s;armed with &s;uch a jerk, that I thought the joint was di&s;located.&mdash;I was no le&s;s confounded than enraged at this event, e&s;pecially as my adver&s;ary did not bear his &s;ucce&s;s with all the moderation that might have been expected; for he in&s;i&s;ted upon my a&s;king pardon for my pre|&s;umption in affronting his king and him.&mdash;This I would by no means comply with, but told him, it was a mean conde&s;cen&s;ion, which no gentle|man in his circum&s;tances ought to propo&s;e, nor none in my &s;ituation perform;&mdash;and that if he per&s;i&s;ted in his ungenerous demand, I would in my turn claim &s;atisfaction with my mu&s;ket, at which weapon we &s;hould be more upon a par, than with the &s;word, of which he &s;eemed &s;o much ma&s;ter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE was di&s;concerted at this declaration, to which he made no reply, but repaired to the dancers, among whom he recounted his victory with many exaggerations and ga&s;conades; while I, taking up my &s;word, went to my quar|ters and examined my wound, which I &s;ound was of no con&s;equence.&mdash;The &s;ame day, an Iri&s;h drummer, having heard my misfortune, vi&s;ited me, and after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to under&s;tand, that he was
<PB N="66" REF="78">
ma&s;ter of his &s;word, and would in a very &s;hort time in&s;truct me &s;o thoroughly in that noble &s;cience, that I &s;hould be able to cha&s;ti&s;e the old ga&s;con for his in&s;olent boa&s;ting at my expence.&mdash;This friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he had for his countrymen; but I afterwards learned the true motive was no other than a jealou&s;y be entertained of a corre&s;pondence between the Frenchman and his wife, which he did not think proper to re&s;ent in per&s;on.&mdash;Be this as it will, I accepted his offer, and practi&s;ed his le&s;&s;ons with &s;uch application, that I &s;oon be|lieved my&s;elf a match for my conqueror.&mdash;In the mean time we continued our march, and arrived at the camp of Mare&s;chal Noailles, the night before the battle of Dettingen. Notwith&s;tanding the fatigue we had undergone, our regiment was one of tho&s;e that were ordered next day to cro&s;s the river, under the command of the Duc de Gramont, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a narrow defile, through which the allies mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have pa&s;&s;ed at a great di&s;advantage, or remain where they were, and peri&s;h for want of provi&s;ion, if they would not conde&s;cend to &s;urrender at di&s;cre|tion.&mdash;How they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be pent up in this manner, it is not my province to re|late; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that when we had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our ground, I heard an old officer in conver&s;ation with another, pro&s;e&s;s a &s;urpri&s;e at the conduct of Lord Stair, who had the repu|tation of a good general.&mdash;But it &s;eems, at this time, that nobleman was over-ruled, and only acted in an inferior character; &s;o that no part of the blame could be imputed to him, who declared his di&s;approbation of the &s;tep, in con&s;equence of which the whole army was in the utmo&s;t dan|ger;
<PB N="67" REF="79">
but providence or de&s;tiny acted miracles in their behalf, by di&s;po&s;ing the Duc de Gramont to quit his advantageous po&s;t, pa&s;s the defile, and attack the Engli&s;h, who were drawn up in order of battle on the plain, and who handled us &s;o roughly, that after having lo&s;t a great number of men, we turned our backs without ceremony, and fled with &s;uch precipitation, that many hun|dreds peri&s;hed in the river, through pure fear and confu&s;ion; for the enemy was &s;o generous, that they did not pur&s;ue us one inch of ground; and if our con&s;ternation would have permitted, we might have retreated with great order and de|liberation.&mdash;But not with&s;tanding the royal cle|mency of the king of Great Britain, who headed the allies in per&s;on, and no doubt, put a &s;top to the carnage, our lo&s;s amounted to 5000 men, among whom were many officers of di&s;tinction.&mdash;Our mi&s;carriage opened a pa&s;&s;age for the foe to Hanau, whither they immediately marched, leaving their &s;ick and wounded to the care of the French, who next day took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle, buried the dead, and treated the living with hu|manity.&mdash;This was a great con&s;olation to us, who thence took occa&s;ion to claim the victory; and the genius of the French nation never ap|peared more con&s;picuous than now, in the rhodo|montades they uttered on the &s;ubject of their gene|ro&s;ity and courage: Every man, (by his own ac|count) performed feats that would have &s;hamed all the heroes of antiquity.&mdash;One compared him|&s;elf to a lion retiring at lei&s;ure from his coward|ly pur&s;uers, who keep at a wary di&s;tance, and gall him with their darts.&mdash;Another likened him|&s;elf to a bear that retreats with his face to the

enemy, who dare not a&s;&s;ail him; and a third a&s;+&s;umed the character of a de&s;perate &s;tag, that turns upon the hounds and keeps them at bay.&mdash;There was not a private &s;oldier engaged, who had not by the prowe&s;s of his &s;ingle arm, de|moli&s;hed a whole platoon, or put a &s;quadron of hor&s;e to flight; and among others, the meagte ga&s;con extoled his exploits above tho&s;e of Her|cules or Charlemagne.&mdash;As I &s;till retained my re&s;entment for the di&s;grace I &s;uffered in my la&s;t recontre with him, and now that I thought my|&s;elf qualified, longed for an opportunity to re|trieve my honour; I magnified the valour of the Engli&s;h with all the hyperboles I could imagine, and decried the pu&s;ilanimity of the French in the &s;ame &s;tile, comparing them to hares flying before grey-hounds, or mice pur&s;ued by cats; and pa&s;&s;ed an ironical compliment on the &s;peed he exerted in his flight, which, con&s;idering his age and in|firmities, I &s;aid was &s;urpri&s;ing.&mdash;He was &s;tung to the quick by this &s;arca&s;m, and with an air of threatning di&s;dain, bid me know my&s;elf better, and remember the correction I had already re|ceived from him for my in&s;olence; for he might not be always in the humour of &s;paring a wretch who abu&s;ed his goodne&s;s. To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick on the breech, which overturned him in an in&s;tant.&mdash;He &s;tarted up with wonderful agility, and drawing his &s;word, attacked me with great fury: Several people interpo&s;ed, but when he informed them of its being an affair of honour, they retired and left us to decide the battle by our&s;elves. I &s;u&s;|tained his on&s;et with little damage, having only received a &s;mall &s;cratch on my right &s;houlder,
<PB N="69" REF="81">
and &s;eeing his breath and vigour almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, a&s;&s;aulted him in my turn, clo&s;ed with him, and wre&s;ted his &s;word out of his hand in the &s;truggle.&mdash;Having thus acquired the victory, I de&s;ired him to beg his life; to which he made no an&s;wer, but &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders to his ears, ex|panded his hands, elevated the &s;kin of his fore|head and eye-brows, and depre&s;&s;ed the corners of his mouth, in &s;uch a manner, that I could &s;carce refrain from laughing aloud at his grote&s;que ap|pearance.&mdash;That I might, however, mortify his vanity, which had triumphed without bounds over my misfortune, I thru&s;t his &s;word up to the hilt in &s;omething (it was not a tan&s;y) that lay &s;moaking on the plain, and joined the re&s;t of the &s;oldiers with an air of tranquility and indiffe|rence.</P>
<P>There was nothing more of moment attempted by either of the armies during the remaining part of the campaign, which being ended, the Engli&s;h marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached to French Flanders, and our regiment ordered to winter-quarters in Cham|pagne.&mdash;It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now belonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found my&s;elf in the utmo&s;t want of every thing: My pay, which amounted to five &s;ols a day, &s;o far from &s;upplying me with nece&s;&s;aries, being &s;carce &s;ufficient to procure a wretched &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance, to keep &s;oul and body together; &s;o that I was by hunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my fellow-&s;ol|diers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable &s;hirts, to two pair of &s;leeves and necks, the bo|dies having been long ago converted into &s;patter|da&s;hes; and after all, I was better provided than

any private man in the regiment.&mdash;In this ur|gency of my affairs, I wrote to my uncle in England, though my hopes from that quarter were not at all &s;anguine, for the rea&s;ons I have already explained, and in the mean time had re|cour&s;e to my old remedy patience, con&s;oling my|&s;elf with the flattering &s;ugge&s;tions of a lively imagination that never abandoned me in my di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>One day, while I &s;tood centinel at the gate of a general officer, a certain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourn|ing, to whom, at parting, I heard him &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You may depend upon my good offices."&mdash;</Q>This a&s;&s;urance was an&s;wered by a low bow of the per&s;on in black, who turning to go away, di&s;covered to me the individual countenance of my old friend and adherent Strap.&mdash;I was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight, that I lo&s;t the power of utterance, and before I could recollect my&s;elf, he was gone, without taking any notice of me.&mdash;Indeed, had he &s;taid, I &s;carce would have ven|tured to acco&s;t him; becau&s;e, though I was per|fectly well acquainted with the features of his face, I could not be po&s;itively certain as to the re&s;t of his per&s;on, which was very much altered for the better, &s;ince he le&s;t me at London; nei|ther could I conjecture by what means he was enabled to appear in the &s;phere of a gentleman, to which, while I knew him, he had not even the ambition to a&s;pire.&mdash;But I was too much concerned in the affair to neglect further information, and therefore took the fir&s;t opportunity of a&s;king the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the Marquis &s;poke. The Swi&s;s told me, his name was Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;trapes, that he had been
<PB N="71" REF="83">
<HI>valet de chambre</HI> to an Engli&s;h gentleman lately decea&s;ed, and that he was very much regarded by the Marquis for his fidelity to his ma&s;ter, be|tween whom and that nobleman a very intimate friend&s;hip had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence, which bani&s;hed all doubt of its being my friend, who had found means to frenchify his name as well as his behaviour, &s;ince we parted. As &s;oon therefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodg|ing, according to a direction given me by the Swi&s;s, and had the good fortune to find him at home. That I might &s;urprize him the more, I concealed my name and bu&s;ine&s;s, and only de|&s;ired the &s;ervant of the hou&s;e, to tell Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;trapes, that I begged the honour of half an hour's conver&s;ation with him.&mdash;He was confound|ed and di&s;mayed at this me&s;&s;age, when he under|&s;tood it was &s;ent by a &s;oldier, though he was con&s;cious to him&s;elf of no crime; all that he had heard of the Ba&s;tile appeared to his imagi|nation with aggravated horror, and it was not before I had waited a con&s;iderable time, that he had re&s;olution enough to bid the &s;ervant &s;hew me up &s;tairs.&mdash;When I entered his chamber, he re|turned my bow with great civility, and endea|voured with forced complai&s;ance, to di&s;gui&s;e his fear, which appeared in the palene&s;s of his face, the wildne&s;s of his looks, and the &s;haking of his limbs.&mdash;I was diverted at his con&s;ternation, which redoubled, when I told him (in French) I had bu&s;ine&s;s for his private ear, and demanded a par|ticular audience.&mdash;The valet being withdrawn, I a&s;ked in the &s;ame language, if his name was d'E&s;trapes, to which he an&s;wered, with a faul|tering tongue, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;ame, at your &s;ervice."&mdash;</Q>

<P>After dinner, I de&s;ired, in my turn, to know the particulars of his peregrination, and he &s;ati&s;|fied me in a few words, by giving me to under|&s;tand that he had lived a year at Paris with his ma&s;ter, who, in that time, having acquired the language, as well as the fa&s;hionable exerci&s;es, to perfection, made a tour of France and Holland, during which excur&s;ion, he was &s;o unfortunate as to meet with three of his own countrymen on their travels, in who&s;e company he committed &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, that his con&s;titution failed, and he fell into a con&s;umption; that by the advice of phy&s;icians he went to Montpelier for the benefit of good air, and recovered &s;o well in &s;ix weeks, that he returned to Rheims, &s;eemingly in good health, where he had not continued above a

As for my own part, I puzzled my imagination to no purpo&s;e; when I thought of turning mer|chant, the &s;mallne&s;s of our &s;tock, and the ri&s;k of &s;eas, enemies and markets, deterred me from that &s;cheme.&mdash;If I &s;hould &s;ettle as a &s;urgeon in my own country, I would find the bu&s;ine&s;s already over&s;tocked; or if I pretended to &s;et up in Eng|land, mu&s;t labour under want of friends and pow|erful oppo&s;ition, ob&s;tacles un&s;urmountable by the mo&s;t &s;hining merit; neither would I &s;ucceed in my endeavours to ri&s;e in the &s;tate, ina&s;much as I could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers, nor pro&s;titute my pen in defence of a wicked and con|temptible admini&s;tration.&mdash;Before I could form one fea&s;ible project, I fell a&s;leep, and my fancy was ble&s;&s;ed with the image of my dear Narci&s;&s;a, who &s;eemed to &s;mile upon my pa&s;&s;ion, and offer her hand as a reward for all my toils.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I found exulting over his happy invention; for I no &s;ooner entered his apartment, than he addre&s;&s;ed me in the&s;e words, with a &s;mile of &s;elf-applau&s;e: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a fool's head &s;ometimes.&mdash;I have hit it&mdash;I'll hold you a button my plan is better than yours, for all your learning.&mdash;But you &s;hall have the preference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let us know the effects of your meditation,&mdash;and then I will impart my own &s;imple excogitations."&mdash;</Q>I told him, that not one thought occurred to me

<P>After breakfa&s;t, Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;trapes went to pay his devoirs to the Marquis, and was &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|ful in his application, that I obtained a di&s;charge in a few days, upon which we &s;et out for Paris.&mdash;Here I had time to reflect and congratulate my&s;elf upon this &s;udden tran&s;ition of fate, which to bear with moderation, required &s;ome degree of philo&s;ophy and &s;elf-denial.&mdash;This will be more obvious, if I give a detail of the particulars, to the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which I was rai&s;ed in an in&s;tant, from the mo&s;t abject mi&s;ery and con|tempt.&mdash;My wardrobe con&s;i&s;ted of five fa&s;hion|able coats full-mounted, two of which were plain, one of cut velvet, one trimed with gold, and another with &s;ilver-lace; two frocks, one of white drab with large plate buttons, the other of blue, with gold binding; one wai&s;tcoat of gold brocard; one of blue &s;attin, embroidered with &s;ilver; one of green &s;ilk, trimmed with broad figured gold lace; one of black &s;ilk, with fi|gures; one of white &s;attin; one of black cloth, and one of &s;carlet; &s;ix pair of cloth breeches; one pair of crim&s;on, and another of black velvet; twelve pair of white &s;ilk &s;tockings, as many of black &s;ilk, and the &s;ame number of fine cotton; one hat, laced with gold <HI>point d' E&s;pagne,</HI> another with &s;ilver-lace &s;colloped, a third with gold bind|ing, and a fourth plain; three dozen of fine ruffled &s;hirts, as many neckcloths; one dozen

of cambrick handkerchiefs, and the like number of &s;ilk. The other moveables which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip of Strap, were, a gold watch with a cha&s;ed ca&s;e, two valuable diamond rings, two mourning &s;words, one with a &s;ilver handle, and a fourth cut &s;teel inlaid with gold; a diamond &s;tock-buckle, and a &s;et of &s;tone buckles for the knees and &s;hoes; a pair of &s;ilver mounted pi&s;tols with rich hou&s;ings; a gold-headed cane, and a &s;nuff-box of tortoi&s;e-&s;hell mounted with gold, having the picture of a lady in the lid.&mdash;The gentleman left many other things of value, which my friend had converted into ca&s;h before I met with him, &s;o that over and above the&s;e particulars, our &s;tock in ready money a|mounted to &s;omething more than two hundred pounds.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as we alighted at the Inn, I di&s;|patched Strap to enquire about my uncle, at the Sam&s;on and Lion in Wapping; and he return|ed in a little time, with an account of Mr. Bowling's having gone to &s;ea, mate of a mer|chant &s;hip, after a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful applica|tion and attendance at the admiralty; where, it &s;eems, the intere&s;t he depended upon, was not &s;ufficient to rein&s;tate him, or recover the pay that was due to him when he quitted the Thunder.</P>
<P>Next day I hired very hand&s;ome lodgings not far from Charing-cro&s;s; and in the evening, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a plain &s;uit of the true Paris cut, and appeared in a front box at the play, where I &s;aw a good deal of company, and had vanity enough to make me believe, that I was ob&s;erved with an uncommon degree of attention and ap|plau&s;e. This &s;illy conceit intoxicated me &s;o much, that I was guilty of a thou&s;and ridiculous co|quetries; and I dare &s;ay, how favourable &s;oever the thoughts of the company might be at my fir&s;t appearance, they were &s;oon changed by my

ab&s;urd behaviour, into pity or contempt.&mdash;I got up and &s;at down, covered and uncovered my head twenty times between the acts; pulled out my watch, clapped it to my ear, wound it up, &s;et it, gave it the hearing again;&mdash;di&s;played my &s;nuff-box, affected to take &s;nuff, that I might have an opportunity of &s;hewing my brilliant, and wiped my no&s;e with a perfumed handkerchief;&mdash;then dangled my cane, and adju&s;ted my &s;word|knot, and acted many more fooleries of the &s;ame kind, in hopes of obtaining the character of a pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which, I found two con&s;iderable ob&s;tructions in my di&s;po&s;ition; namely, a natural re&s;erve, and jealous &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;Fain would I have entered into conver&s;ation with the people around me; but was re&s;trained by the fear of being cen&s;ured for my a&s;&s;urance, as well as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a compliment of this kind from them than they to &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion from a &s;tranger like me.&mdash;How often did I redden at the frequent whi&s;pers and loud laughter of my fellow beaus, which I imagined were excited by me! and how often did I envy the happy indifference of tho&s;e choice &s;pirits who beheld the di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;cene, with|out di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of approbation or concern!

genteelly dre&s;&s;ed, &s;itting by her&s;elf in a box, at &s;ome di&s;tance from me; upon which I went up to her, and offered my &s;ervice.&mdash;She &s;eemed to to be in &s;ome confu&s;ion, thanked me for my complai&s;ance, and with a tender look declined giving me the trouble; looking at her watch, and te&s;tifying her &s;urprize at the negligence of her footman, whom &s;he had ordered to have a chair ready for her at that hour.&mdash;I repeated my in|treaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was ma&s;ter of; and in the event, &s;he was pre|vailed upon to accept of a propo&s;al I made, to &s;end my &s;ervant for a chair or coach: Accordingly, Strap was detached for that purpo&s;e, and returned without &s;ucce&s;s, there being none to be found; by this time the play-hou&s;e was quite empty, and we were obliged to retire: As I led her through the pa&s;&s;age, I ob&s;erved five or &s;ix young fellows of fa&s;hion, &s;tanding in a corner, one of whom, as I thought, tipt my charmer the wink, and when we were pa&s;t, I heard them &s;et up the loud laugh.&mdash;This arrou&s;ed my attention, and I was re&s;olved to be fully &s;atisfied of this lady's charac|ter, before I &s;hould have any nearer connexion with her.&mdash;As no convenience appeared, I pro|po&s;ed, that I &s;hould conduct her to a tavern, where we might &s;tay a few minutes, until my &s;er|vant could fetch a coach from the Strand.&mdash;She &s;eemed particularly &s;hy of tru&s;ting her&s;elf in a tavern with a &s;tranger; but at la&s;t, yielded to my pathetic remon&s;trances, rather than endanger her health, by remaining in a cold damp thorough-fare.&mdash;Having thus far &s;ucceeded, I begged to know what wine &s;he would be plea&s;ed to drink a gla&s;s of; but &s;he profe&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t aver&s;ion to all &s;orts of &s;trong liquors; and it was with much dif|ficulty

that I could per&s;uade her to eat a jelly.&mdash;In the mean time, I endeavoured to alleviate the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he di&s;covered, by &s;aying all the agreeable things I could think of; at which &s;he would often &s;igh, and regard me with a langui&s;h|ing look, that &s;eemed too near a-kin to the lewd leer of a courtezan.&mdash;This di&s;covery added to my former &s;u&s;picion, while it put me upon my guard again&s;t her arts, dive&s;ted me of re&s;erve, and enabled me to entertain her with more gaity and freedom.&mdash;In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, I pre&s;&s;ed her to allow me the honour of waiting upon her next day, at her lodgings, which &s;he, with many apologies, refu&s;ed, le&s;t it &s;hould give umbrage to Sir John, who was of a di&s;po&s;ition apt to be fretted with trifles.&mdash;This information, by which I was to under&s;tand that her hu&s;band was a knight, did not check my addre&s;&s;es, which be|came more and more importunate, and I was even hardy enough to ravi&s;h a ki&s;s.&mdash;But, O heavens! in&s;tead of banqueting on the ambro&s;ial flavour, that her delicacy and complexion promi&s;ed, I was al|mo&s;t &s;uffocated with the &s;teams of Geneva! An exhalation of this kind from a mouth which had ju&s;t before declared an utter abhorrence of all &s;pirituous liquors, not only changed my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; and it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have pre&s;erved common complai&s;ance five mi|nutes longer, when my &s;ervant returned with a coach.&mdash;I took the advantage of this occa&s;ion, and pre&s;ented my hand to the lady, who put in practice again&s;t me the whole artillery of her charms, ogling, langui&s;hing, &s;ighing, and &s;queez|ing, with &s;o little re&s;erve, that Strap perceived her tenderne&s;s, and rubbed his hands with joy as
<PB N="84" REF="96">

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Accepted his offer with plea&s;ure, and we went thither in a hackney-coach, where I &s;aw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, mo&s;t of whom &s;poke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among the re&s;t, &s;tood a groupe of them around the fire, whom I immediately knew to be the very per&s;ons who had the night before, by their laughing, alarmed my &s;u&s;picion of the lady who had put her&s;elf under my protection.&mdash;They no &s;ooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail (for that was my companion's name) than they tittered and whi&s;pered one to another; and I was not a little &s;urprized to find that they were the gentle|men to who&s;e acquaintance he de&s;igned to re|commend me; for when he ob&s;erved them to|gether,
<PB N="100" REF="112">
he told me who they were, and de&s;ired to know by what name he &s;hould introduce me.

upon progno&s;tics, diagno&s;tics, &s;ymptomatics, the|rapeutics, inanition, and repletion; then calcu|lated the force of the &s;tomach and lungs in their re&s;pective operations; a&s;cribed the player's malady to a di&s;order in the&s;e organs, proceeding from hard drinking and vociferation, and pre|&s;cribed a cour&s;e of &s;tomachics, with ab&s;tinence from venery, wine, and loud &s;peaking, laughing, &s;inging, coughing, &s;neezing or hollowing.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pah, pah, (cried Ranter, interrupting him) the remedy is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;I wi&s;h I knew where to find &s;ome tinder-water."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tinder-water!

<P>Mean while I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening went to the opera with him and Mr. Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in one of the boxes, and offered to in|troduce me to her, ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that &s;he was a reigning toa&s;t worth ten thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;This piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I di&s;covered great

eagerne&s;s to accept the propo&s;al; upon which he a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould dance with her at the next a&s;&s;embly, if he had any influence in that quarter; &s;o &s;aying, he went round, &s;poke to her &s;ome minutes, and, as I imagined, pointed at me, then returning, told me, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, that I might depend upon what he had promi&s;ed, for &s;he was now engaged as my partner.&mdash;Ban|ter, in a whi&s;per, gave me to under&s;tand that &s;he was an incorrigible coquette, who would grant the &s;ame favour to any young fellow in England, of a tolerable appearance, meerly to engage him among the herd of her admirers, that &s;he might have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them increa&s;e daily;&mdash;that &s;he was of a cold in&s;en&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition, dead to every pa&s;&s;ion but vanity, and &s;o blind to merit, that he would lay any wager, the wealthie&s;t fool &s;hould carry her at la&s;t. I attributed a good deal of this intelligence to the &s;atirical turn of my friend, or re&s;entment, for having him&s;elf &s;uf|fered a rebuff from the lady in que&s;tion; and at any rate, tru&s;ted &s;o much to my own accompli&s;h|ments, as to believe no woman could re&s;i&s;t the ardour of my addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Full of this confidence, I repaired to Hamp|&s;tead, in company with Billy Chatter, my Lord Hobble, and doctor Wagtail.&mdash;Here I &s;aw a very brilliant a&s;&s;embly, before whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with Melinda, who charmed me with her frank manner of re|ceiving me, and ea&s;ine&s;s of behaviour.&mdash;Before the country dances began, I received a me&s;&s;age by a per&s;on I did not know, from Bragwell, who was pre&s;ent, importing that no body who knew him, pre&s;umed to dance with Melinda, while he was there in per&s;on; and that I would
<PB N="118" REF="130">
do well to relinqui&s;h her without noi&s;e, becau&s;e he had a mind to lead up a country dance with her. This extraordinary intimation, which was delivered in the lady's hearing, did not at all di&s;compo&s;e me, who by this time was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival. I therefore, without the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of concern, bid the gentleman tell Mr. Bragwell, that while I was &s;o happy as to obtain the lady's con&s;ent, I &s;hould not be &s;ollicitous about his; and de&s;ired the bearer him&s;elf to bring me no &s;uch imperti|nent me&s;&s;ages for the future. Melinda affected a &s;ort of confu&s;ion, and pretended to wonder that Mr. Bragwell &s;hould give him&s;elf &s;uch liber|ties with regard to her, who had no manner of connexion with the fellow. I laid hold of this opportunity to di&s;play my valour, and offered to call him to account for his in&s;olence, which &s;he ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed, under pretence of con&s;ulting my &s;afety; though I could perceive by the &s;parkling of her eyes, that &s;he would not have thought her|&s;elf affronted in being the &s;ubject of a duel. I was by no means plea&s;ed with this di&s;covery of her thoughts, which not only argued the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable vanity, but likewi&s;e the mo&s;t barba|rous indifference; however, I was allured by her fortune, and re&s;olved to gratify her pride, in making her the occa&s;ion of a publick quarrel be|tween me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty cer|tain, would never drive matters to a dangerous extremity.</P>
<P>While we danced together, I ob&s;erved this formidable rival at one end of the room, en|circled with a clu&s;ter of beaus, to whom he talked with great vehemence, ca&s;ting many big looks at me, from time to time: I gue&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="119" REF="131">
&s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e, and as &s;oon as I had handed my partner to her &s;eat, &s;trutted up to the place where he &s;tood, and cocking my hat in his face, demanded aloud, if he had any thing to &s;ay to me. He an&s;wered with a fullen tone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nothing, at pre&s;ent, Sir,"</Q> and turned about upon his heel.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, (&s;aid I) you know where I am to be found at any time."&mdash;</Q>His companions &s;tared at one another, and I returned to the lady, who&s;e features brightened at my ap|proach, and immediately a whi&s;per run thro' the whole room; after which, &s;o many eyes were turned upon me, that I was ready to &s;ink with confu|&s;ion.&mdash;When the ball broke up, I led her to her coach, and, like a true French gallant, would have got up behind it, in order to protect her from violence on the road; but &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed my offer, and expre&s;&s;ed her concern that-there was not an empty &s;eat for me with|in it.</P>
<P>Next day in the afternoon I waited on her at her lodgings, by permi&s;&s;ion, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by her mother, with whom &s;he lived;&mdash;there were a good many fa&s;hionable people pre&s;ent, chiefly young fellows, and immediately after tea a couple of card tables were &s;et, at one of which I had the honour to play with Melinda, who in le&s;s than three hours made &s;hift to plunder me of eight guineas.&mdash;I was well enough content to lo&s;e a little money with a good grace, that I might have an opportunity to &s;ay &s;oft things in the mean time, which are &s;till mo&s;t welcome, when attended with good luck; but I was by no means &s;atisfied with her fair play, a circum&s;tance that &s;hocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my

<P>It was late before I took my leave, after being favoured with a general invitation; and when I got into bed, the adventures of the day hindered me from &s;leeping.&mdash;Sometimes I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a fine woman with ten thou&s;and pounds; then I would ruminate on the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with the circum&s;tances of her conduct towards me, which &s;eemed to bear too great a re&s;emblance to the picture he had drawn.&mdash;This introduced a melancholy reflection on the expence I had undergone, and the &s;mallne&s;s of my funds to &s;upport it, which, by the bye, were none of my own.&mdash;In &s;hort, I found my&s;elf in|volved in doubts and perplexities, that kept me awake the greate&s;t part of the night.</P>

<P>This good creature's unalterable friend&s;hip for me affected me with the mo&s;t grateful &s;en|timents, and acted as a &s;pur to my re&s;olution of acquiring a fortune, that I might have it in my power to manife&s;t my genero&s;ity in my turn.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e, I determined to bring matters to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion with Melinda; well know|ing that a few &s;uch nights as the la&s;t, would ef|fectually incapacitate me from pro&s;ecuting that, or any other advantageous amour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>We repair to the coffee-hou&s;e, where we over|hear a curious di&s;pute between Wagtail and Medlar, which is referred to our de|ci&s;ion&mdash;the doctor gives us an account of his experiment&mdash;Medlar is roa&s;ted by Banter, at the ordinary&mdash;the old gentle|man's advice to me.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEING as willing to drop the theme, as he to propo&s;e it, I accompanied him thither, where we found Mr. Medlar and doctor Wagtail, di&s;puting upon the word Cu&s;tard, which the phy|&s;ician affirmed &s;hould be &s;pelled with a G, be|cau&s;e it was derived from the Latin verb <HI>gu&s;tare,</HI> "to ta&s;te."&mdash;But Medlar pleaded cu&s;tom in be|half of C, ob&s;erving, that by the doctor's rule, we ought to change pudding into budding, be|cau&s;e it is derived from the French word <HI>boudin;</HI> and in that ca&s;e, why not retain the original or|thography and pronounciation of all the foreign words we have adopted; by which means our language would become a di&s;&s;onant jargon with|out &s;tandard or propriety. The controver&s;y was referred to us; and Banter, notwith&s;tanding his real opinion to the contrary, decided it in favour of Wagtail: Upon which, the peevi&s;h annuitant aro&s;e, and uttering the mono&s;yllable, <HI>pi&s;h!</HI> with great empha&s;is, removed to another table.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="139">
We then enquired of the doctor, what progre&s;s he had made in the experiment of di&s;tilling tinder|water; and he told us, he had been at all the gla&s;s-hou&s;es about town, but could find no body who would undertake to blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the quantity pre&s;cribed; but he intended to try the proce&s;s on as much as would produce five drops, which would be &s;ufficient to prove the &s;pecific, and then he would make it a parliamentary affair;&mdash;that he had already purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable weight of rags, in the reducing of which to tin|der, he had met with a misfortune which had obliged him to change his lodgings: For he had gathered them in a heap on the floor, and &s;et fire to them with a candle, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the boards would &s;u&s;tain no damage, becau&s;e it is the nature of flame to a&s;cend; but by &s;ome very extraordinary accident, the wood was in|vaded, and began to blaze with great violence, which di&s;ordered him &s;o much, that he had not pre&s;ence of mind enough to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the whole hou&s;e mu&s;t have been con&s;umed with him in the mid&s;t of it, had not the &s;moke that rolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the neighbourhood, and brought people to his &s;uccour.&mdash;That he had lo&s;t a pair of black vel|vet breeches and a tye-wig in the hurry, be&s;ides the expence of the rags, which were rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the water u&s;ed to quench the flame, and the damage of the floor, which he was compelled to repair.&mdash;That his landlord believing him di&s;|tracted, had in&s;i&s;ted on his quitting his apart|ment at a minute's warning, which put him to incredible inconvenience; but now he was &s;et|tled in a very comfortable hou&s;e, and had the
<PB N="128" REF="140">
u&s;e of a large paved yard for preparing his tin|der: So that he hoped in a very &s;hort time to reap the fruits of his labour.</P>
<P>After having congratulated the doctor on his pro&s;pect, and read the papers, we repaired to an auction of pictures, where we entertained our|&s;elves an hour or two; from thence we adjourned to the Mall, and after two or three turns, went back to dinner, Banter a&s;&s;uring us, that be in|tended to roa&s;t Medlar, at the ordinary; and in|deed, we were no &s;ooner &s;et than this Cynic began to execute his purpo&s;e by telling the old gentle|man, he looked extremely well, con&s;idering the little &s;leep he had enjoyed la&s;t night. To this compliment Medlar made no reply, but by a &s;tare, accompanied with a &s;ignificant grin;&mdash;and Banter went on thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't know whether mo&s;t to admire the charity of your mind, or the vigour of your body.&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, Mr. Medlar, you do generous things with the be&s;t ta&s;te of any man I know! You extend your compa&s;&s;ion to real objects, and exact only &s;uch returns as they are capable of making.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, gentlemen, (&s;aid he, turning to the company) I had been up mo&s;t part of the night with a friend who is bad of a fever, and on my return home this morning, I chanced to pa&s;s by a gin-&s;hop &s;till open, whence i&s;&s;ued a confu&s;ed &s;ound of mirth and jollity: Upon which I popped in my head, and perceived Mr. Medlar dancing bare-headed in the mid&s;t of ten or twenty ragged Bunters, who rejoiced at his expence. But indeed, Mr. Medlar, you ought not to &s;acrifice your con&s;titution to your benevolence.&mdash;Con&s;ider you grow old apace; and there|fore
<PB N="129" REF="141">
have a reverend care of your health, which mu&s;t certainly be very much impaired by the&s;e nocturnal expeditions."&mdash;</Q>The te&s;ty &s;enior could no longer contain him&s;elf, but cried ha&s;tily, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'Tis well known that your tongue is no &s;lander."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think (&s;aid the other) you might &s;pare that ob&s;ervation, as you are very &s;en&s;ible that my tongue has done you &s;ignal &s;ervice on many occa&s;ions.&mdash;You may remem|ber, that when you made your addre&s;&s;es to the fat widow, who kept a publick-hou&s;e at I&s;lington, there was a report &s;pread very much to the prejudice of your manhood; which coming to the ears of your mi&s;tre&s;s, you was di&s;carded immediately; and I brought matters to a reconciliation, by a&s;&s;uring her you had three ba&s;tards at nur&s;e in the country: How you ruined your own affair afterwards, it is neither my bu&s;ine&s;s nor inclination to relate."&mdash;</Q>This anecdote, which had no other foundation than in Banter's own invention, afforded a good deal of mirth to every body pre&s;ent, and pro|voked Mr. Medlar beyond all &s;ufferance; &s;o that he &s;tarted up in a mighty pa&s;&s;ion, and forgetting that his mouth was full, be&s;pattered tho&s;e who &s;at next to him, while he di&s;charged his indig|nation in a volly of oaths, and call'd Banter in|&s;ignificant puppy, impertinent jackanapes, and an hundred &s;uch appellations; telling the company, he had invented the&s;e fal&s;e malicious a&s;per&s;ions, becau&s;e he would not lend him money to &s;quan|der away upon rooks and whores.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A very likely &s;tory, (&s;aid Banter) that I &s;hould attempt to borrow money of a man who is obliged to practice a thou&s;and &s;hifts to make his weekly allowance hold out to Saturday's

night. Sometimes he &s;leeps four and twenty hours at a &s;tretch, by which means he &s;aves three meals be&s;ides coffee-hou&s;e expence.&mdash;Sometimes he is fain to put up with bread and chee&s;e and &s;mall beer for dinner; and &s;ometimes he regales on two pennyworth of ox-cheek in a cellar."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are a lying mi&s;creant (cried Medlar, in an ex&s;tacy of rage) I can al|ways command money enough to pay your taylor's bill, which I'm &s;ure is no trifle; and I have a good mind to give you a convincing proof of my circum&s;tances, by pro&s;ecuting you for de|famation, &s;irrah."&mdash;</Q>By this time the violence of his wrath had deprived him of his appetite, and he &s;at &s;ilent, unable to &s;wallow one mouth|ful, while his tormentor enjoyed his mortification, and encrea&s;ed his chagrin, by advi&s;ing him to lay in plentifully for his next day's fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, we came down &s;tairs to the coffee-room, and Banter went away to keep an appointment, &s;aying, he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould &s;ee Wagtail and me in the evening at the Bed|ford coffee-hou&s;e.&mdash;He was no &s;ooner gone, than the old gentleman took me a&s;ide, and &s;aid, he was &s;orry to &s;ee me &s;o intimate with that fellow who was one of the mo&s;t gracele&s;s rakes about town, and had already wa&s;ted a good e&s;tate and con&s;titution upon harlots;&mdash;that he had been the ruin of many a young man, by introducing them into debauched company, and &s;etting a lewd ex|ample of all manner of wickedne&s;s; and that, unle&s;s I was on my guard, he would &s;trip me in a &s;hort time, both of my money and reputa|tion. I thanked him for his information, and promi&s;ed to conduct my&s;elf accordingly, wi&s;hing however, his caution had been a few hours
<PB N="131" REF="143">
more early, by which means I might have &s;aved five guineas. Notwith&s;tanding this intelligence, I was inclinable to impute &s;ome part of the charge to Medlar's revenge for the liberties taken with him at dinner; and therefore, as &s;oon as I could di&s;engage my&s;elf, applied to Wagtail for his opinion of the character in que&s;tion; re&s;olved to compare their accounts, allowing for the pre|judice of each, and form my judgment upon both, without adhering &s;trictly to either.&mdash;The doctor a&s;&s;ured me that he was a very pretty gen|tleman, of family and fortune; a &s;cholar, a wit, a critick, and perfectly well acquainted with the town; that his honour and courage were unque|&s;tionable, though &s;ome extravagancies he had been guilty of, and his talent for &s;atire, had pro|cured him enemies, and made &s;ome people &s;hy of his acquaintance.&mdash;From the&s;e different &s;ketches, I concluded that Banter was a young fellow of &s;ome parts, who had &s;pent his fortune, but retaine I his appetites, and fallen out with the world becau&s;e he could not enjoy it to his wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I went to the Bedford coffee-hou&s;e in the even|ing, where I met my friends, from thence pro|ceeded to the play, and afterwards carried them home to my lodgings, where we &s;upped with great harmony and &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>WHEN I was ready to go abroad next day, Strap brought me a letter, directed <HI>To Mr. Random, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Tho&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Which, upon opening, I found contained a challenge, couched in the&s;e very extraordinary terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas, I am informed that you make love to Mi&s;s Melinda Goo&s;etrap, This is to let you know, that &s;he is under promi&s;e of marriage to me; and that I am at this pre&s;ent writing, at the back of Montague|hou&s;e, with a pair of good pi&s;tols in my hand, and if you will keep your appointment, I will make your tongue confe&s;s (after the

breath is out of your body) that you do not de&s;erve her as well as</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Yours, &amp;c.</HI> Rourk Oregan.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I gue&s;&s;ed from the &s;tile and &s;ub&s;cription of this billet, that my rival was a true Mile&s;ian, and was not a little unea&s;y at the contents, e&s;pecial|ly that part, where he a&s;&s;erts his right to my mi&s;tre&s;s by promi&s;e, a circum&s;tance I did not know how to reconcile to her penetration.&mdash;However, this was no time for me to decline the invitation, becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;s of my ad|dre&s;&s;es might in a great mea&s;ure depend up|on my behaviour in that affair. I therefore immediately loaded my pi&s;tols, and betook my|&s;elf in a hackney-coach to the place appointed, where I found a tall raw-boned man, with a hard featured countenance, and black bu&s;hy beard, walking by him&s;elf, wrapped up in a &s;habby great coat, over which his own hair de|&s;cended in a leathern queue from his head, that was covered with a grea&s;y hat trimmed with a tarni&s;hed <HI>pointe d'e&s;pagne.</HI> He no &s;ooner per|ceived me advancing, than without any preamble, he pulled a pi&s;tol from his bo&s;om, and pre&s;enting at me, &s;napt it. Alarmed at this rude &s;alutation, I made a &s;tand, and before he could adju&s;t his other piece, fired one of mine at him, without doing any damage. By this time he was ready with his &s;econd, that fla&s;hed in the pan with|out going off: Upon which he called, with a true Tipperary cadence, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fire away, honey,"&mdash;</Q>and began to hammer his flint with great de|deliberation.&mdash;But
<PB N="134" REF="146">
I was re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the advantage Fortune had given me; and therefore &s;tept up, without throwing away my fire, de&s;iring him to a&s;k his life, or prepare for another world;&mdash;but this &s;tout Hibernian refu&s;ed to conde&s;cend, and complained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before he could return my &s;hot; &s;aying I ought to go back to my &s;tation, and let him have an equal chance with me.&mdash;I endeavoured to per&s;uade him that I had given him a double chance already; and it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to prevent him from enjoying a third;&mdash;but now, &s;ince I had an opportunity, I de|manded a parley, and de&s;ired to know his condi|tion, and rea&s;on for calling me to the field, who, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, &s;o far from having done him any injury, had never be|fore &s;een him.&mdash;He told me, that he was a gen|tleman of fortune, who had &s;pent all he had, and hearing that Melinda had got ten thou&s;and pounds, he intended to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that &s;um by e&s;pou&s;ing her, and was determined, in an ho|nourable way, to cut the throats of all tho&s;e who &s;tood between him and his hopes.&mdash;I then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; and now that I had &s;een him, being more and more a&s;toni&s;hed at the circum&s;tance of the pro|mi&s;e, de&s;ired he would explain that my&s;tery:&mdash;He gave me to under&s;tand, that he tru&s;ted en|tirely to his birth and per&s;onal merit; that he had frequently wrote to Melinda, &s;etting forth his claim and preten&s;ions, but &s;he was never kind enough to &s;end an an&s;wer, or even to admit him into her pre&s;ence; and that the promi&s;e he men|tioned in his letter, was made by his friend Mr. Gaghagan, who a&s;&s;ured him, that no woman
<PB N="135" REF="147">
could re&s;i&s;t a man of his appearance.&mdash;I could not forbear laughing to exce&s;s, at the &s;implicity of my rival, who did not &s;eem to reli&s;h my mirth; but began to be very &s;erious: Upon which I endeavoured to appea&s;e him, by giving him my word and honour, that &s;o far from pre|judicing his addre&s;&s;es to the lady, I would repre|&s;ent him to her in the mo&s;t favourable light I could, with any regard to truth; but he mu&s;t not be &s;urprized if &s;he &s;hould remain blind to his de&s;erts, for nothing was more capricious than a woman's mind, and the affection of that &s;ex was &s;eldom purcha&s;ed with virtue alone.&mdash;That my declaration might have the better effect, I took notice of his di&s;habille, and profe&s;&s;ing &s;orrow at &s;eeing a gentleman reduced, &s;lipt two guineas in|to his hand, at the &s;ight of which, he threw away his pi&s;tols, and hugging me in his arms, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Arrah, by Je&s;us, now, you are the be&s;t friend I have met with the&s;e &s;even long years."&mdash;</Q>When I had &s;uffered &s;ome minutes in his em|brace, he quitted me, and picking up his ru&s;ty arms, wi&s;hed the devil might burn him if ever he &s;hould give me any further trouble about wo|man-kind.</P>
<P>The quarrel being thus amicably compo&s;ed, I begged leave to look at his pi&s;tols, which I found &s;o crazy and &s;o foul, that, I believe, it was happy for him neither of them was di&s;charged, for one of them would certainly have &s;plit in the going off, and he would, in all probability, have lo&s;t his hand in the explo&s;ion; but what gave me a lively idea of the man's character, was to find, upon examination, that one of them had been loaded without being primed, and the other primed without a charge.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="148">
While we walked homeward together, I ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of knowing my new friend's hi&s;tory; and he informed me of his having &s;erved in the German army as a volunteer again&s;t the Turks; that for his behaviour at the &s;iege of Belgrade, he had been honoured with an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion, and afterwards promoted to the rank of lieutenant, in which &s;tation, it was his misfortune to affront his captain, who challenged him to the field, and was killed in the duel, upon which he was obliged to retreat;&mdash;that he had been in England &s;ome years &s;olliciting his friends for provi&s;ion in the Briti&s;h army; but being hitherto un&s;ucce&s;sful, he was de&s;ired by Mr. Gaghagan to turn his thoughts to matrimo|ny, and make his fortune by an advantageous match; in con&s;equence of which advice, he had made up to Melinda, and having heard, by means of an Iri&s;h footman in the family, that I was her chief favourite, had called me out in hopes of removing by my death, the greate&s;t ob&s;truction to his de&s;ires; but now he was convinced of my honour and genero&s;ity, he &s;wore by the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, he would think of her no more, if there was not another woman in the world.&mdash;As a further proof of his veracity, which I did not at all doubt, he opened an old iron &s;nuff-box, and pulled out his commi&s;&s;ion in the imperial army, and his captain's challenge, which he pre&s;erved as te&s;timonials of his character.&mdash;I was &s;o well convinced of this poor man's hone&s;ty and cou|rage, that I determined to &s;peak in his behalf to &s;ome of my acquaintance, who might recom|mend his ca&s;e to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who could provide for him; and in the mean time to accommodate him with a few cloaths, by which
<PB N="137" REF="149">
his appearance would be much mended, and him|&s;elf enabled to renew his &s;olicitations in per|&s;on.</P>
<P>As we walked along, conver&s;ing &s;ocially to|gether, we were met by a file of Mu&s;queteers, and Strap at their head, who no &s;ooner approach|ed, than with a frantick look, he cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Seize them!&mdash;in the name of God! &s;eize them"&mdash;</Q>We were accordingly &s;urrounded, and I put in arre&s;t by the corporal, who was commanding of|ficer; but captain Oregan di&s;engaged him&s;elf, and run with &s;uch &s;peed towards Tottenham-court-road, that he was out of &s;ight in a moment. When my arms were delivered up, and my&s;elf &s;ecured, Strap be|came a little more compo&s;ed, and a&s;ked pardon for the liberty he had taken, which he hoped I would excu&s;e, as it proceeded from his affection: He then told me that, &s;u&s;pecting the letter (which by the bye was brought by the author him&s;elf) contained &s;omething extraordinary, he had peeped through the key-hole, and &s;een me load my pi&s;tols; upon which he run down to Whitehall, and applied to the officer on guard, for a party to put me in arre&s;t, but before he returned, I was gone in a coach; that he had enquired which way I went, and having often heard, that duels were commonly fought at the back of Montague-hou&s;e, he conducted the guard to this place, where he thanked God for having found me &s;afe and &s;ound. I let him know, that I forgave his officious con|cern for once, but cautioned him in pretty &s;evere terms, from making me the &s;ubject of idle con|ver&s;ation for the future; then, turning to the corporal, I thanked him for his care, and gave hime a crown to drink with his men, a&s;&s;uring him that the rencontre was over long before he

<P>He was not gone an hundred yards, when my friend Oregan came up, in order to re&s;cue me, with two Tatterdemalions whom he had engaged for that purpo&s;e, about the purlieus of St. Giles's: One of them was armed with a mu&s;ket that wanted a lock, and another with a ru&s;ty broad|&s;word; but their dre&s;s &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all de&s;cription.&mdash;When he under&s;tood I was already free, he made an apology for his abrupt departure, and introduced me to his two companions: Fir&s;t, to coun&s;ellor Fitz-clabber, who, he told me, was then employed in compiling a hi&s;tory of the kings of Mun&s;ter, from Iri&s;h manu&s;cripts; and then to his friend Mr. Gaghagan, who was a profound philo&s;opher and politician, and had projected many excellent &s;chemes for the good of his country.&mdash;But it &s;eems the&s;e literati had been very ill rewarded for their ingenious labours; for be|tween them both, there was but one &s;hirt and half a pair of breeches.&mdash;I thanked them very kindly for their readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and having offered my &s;ervice in my turn, wi&s;hed them a good-morrow, de&s;iring Oregan to accompany me to my lodgings, where he was fitted with decent cloaths from my wardrobe, &s;o much to his &s;ati&s;|faction, that he &s;wore eternal gratitude and friend|&s;hip

<P>In the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who received me with great kindne&s;s and familiarity, and laughed exce&s;&s;ively at my adventure with the Iri&s;hman, to who&s;e wi&s;hes &s;he was no &s;tranger, having more than a dozen letters in her po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, which he had wrote to her on the &s;ubject of love, and which, for my entertainment, &s;he &s;ubmitted to my peru&s;al.&mdash;Having made our&s;elves merry at the expence of this poor admirer, I &s;eized the opportunity of her mother's going out of the room, and introduced my own pa&s;&s;ion, which I recommended to her with all the ardour and elo|quence I was ma&s;ter of.&mdash;I flattered, &s;ighed, &s;wore, intreated, and acted a thou&s;and extrava|gancies, in hopes of making &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on her heart; but &s;he heard every thing I &s;aid with|out di&s;covering the lea&s;t emotion; and other company came in, before &s;he would vouch&s;afe one &s;erious reply.&mdash;After tea, the cards were brought in according to cu&s;tom, and it was my good fortune to have Melinda for my partner; by which means, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing, I came off with five guineas clear gain.</P>
<P>I &s;oon became acquainted with a good many people of fa&s;hion, and &s;pent my time in the mo|di&s;h diver&s;ions of the town, &s;uch as plays, ope|ras, ma&s;querades, drums, a&s;&s;emblies and puppet|&s;hews; chiefly in company with Melinda, whom I cultivated with all the eagerne&s;s and addre&s;s that my pro&s;pect could in&s;pire, and my education afford: I &s;pared neither my per&s;on nor my pur&s;e, to gratify her vanity and pride; my rivals were intimidated, and indeed out-&s;hone; and after all, I began to fear that the dear creature had not

a heart to lo&s;e.&mdash;At la&s;t, finding my&s;elf unable to &s;upport the expence of this amour much longer, I was determined to bring the matter to a cri&s;is; and one evening, while we were <HI>t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te,</HI> complained of her indifference, de&s;cribed the tortures of &s;u&s;pence to a love-&s;ick mind, and pre&s;&s;ed her to di&s;clo&s;e her &s;entiments of matrimo|ny and me, with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, that &s;he could not with all her art, &s;hift the &s;ubject; but was obliged to come to an eclairci&s;&s;ement.&mdash;She let me know with a carele&s;s air, that &s;he had no objection to my per&s;on, and if I could &s;atisfy her mother in other particulars, I &s;hould not find her aver&s;e to the match; but &s;he was re&s;olved to do nothing in an affair of &s;uch moment'ous con|cern, without the advice and con&s;ent of her pa|rent.&mdash;This was not a very agreeable de|claration to me, who&s;e aim had been to win her inclination fir&s;t, and then &s;ecure my con|que&s;t by a private marriage, to which I flat|tered my&s;elf &s;he would expre&s;s no reluctance.&mdash;That I might not, however, de&s;ert my cau&s;e before it was de&s;perate, I waited on the mother, and with great formality demanded the daughter in marriage: The good lady, who was a very notable woman, behaved with great &s;tate and civility; thanked me for the honour I intended her family, and &s;aid, &s;he did not doubt that I was in all re&s;pects qualified to make a woman happy; but it concerned her as a parent anxious about the welfare of her child, to enquire into the particulars of my fortune, and know what &s;ettlement I propo&s;ed to make. To this intimation, which would have utterly di&s;concerted me, if I had not expected it, I replied without he&s;itation, that though my
<PB N="141" REF="153">
fortune was very &s;mall, I was a gentleman by birth and education, would maintain her daughter in the &s;phere of a gentlewoman, and &s;ettle her own dowry on her and her heirs for ever.&mdash;This careful matron did not &s;eem to reli&s;h my propo&s;al, but ob&s;erved with a demure counte|nance, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ettling that upon her child which was her own already: However, if I plea&s;ed, her lawyer &s;hould con|fer with mine upon the matter; and in the mean time, &s;he de&s;ired I would favour her with the peru&s;al of my rent-roll.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the vexation I was under, I could &s;carce forbear laughing in her face, at the mention of my rent|roll, which was, indeed, a &s;evere piece of &s;atire upon my preten&s;ions. I frankly owned I had no landed e&s;tate: and told her, that I could not exactly &s;pecify the &s;um I was ma&s;ter of, un|til I had regulated my affairs, which were at pre&s;ent in &s;ome di&s;order; but that I would take an opportunity of &s;atisfying her on that head very &s;oon.</P>
<P>It was not long before I took my leave, and returned to my lodgings in a very melancholy mood, per&s;uaded that I had nothing more to expect from that quarter: I was confirmed in this opi|nion next day, when I went back with a view of explaining my&s;elf more fully to the old gen|tlewoman; and was told by the footman, that his ladies were not at home, although I had &s;een Melinda through the blinds of a parlour win|dow, as I went up to the door. Incen&s;ed at this affront I quitted the door, without &s;aying one word, and as I repa&s;&s;ed the parlour, bowed to Mi&s;s, who &s;till remained in the &s;ame &s;ituation,
<PB N="142" REF="154">
&s;ecurely &s;creened, as &s;he thought, from my view.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment gave me more unea&s;ine&s;s on Strap's account, than my own; for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the contrary, the remembrance of my charming Narci&s;&s;a, was a continual check upon my con|&s;cience, during the whole cour&s;e of my addre&s;&s;es; and perhaps contributed to the bad &s;ucce&s;s of my &s;cheme, by controuling my raptures, and condemning my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>There was a nece&s;&s;ity for acquainting my com|panion with every thing that happened to me, and I performed this piece of duty in an affected pa&s;&s;ion, &s;wearing I would be his pack-hor&s;e no longer, and de&s;iring him to take the manage|ment of his affairs into his own hand. This fi|ne&s;&s;e had the de&s;ired effect, for in&s;tead of grum|bling over my mi&s;carriage, Strap was frightened at the pa&s;&s;ion I feigned, and begged me for the love of God to be appea&s;ed; ob&s;erving, that al|though we had &s;uffered a great lo&s;s, it was not irreparable; and if fortune frowned to day, &s;he might perhaps &s;mile to-morrow.&mdash;I pretended to acquie&s;ce in his remarks, prai&s;e his equanimity, and promi&s;e to improve by misfortune.&mdash;He, on the other hand, pretended to be perfectly well &s;atisfied with my conduct, and conjured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection; but in &s;pite of all his affectation, I could perceive his inward af|fliction, and his vi&s;age &s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed in lon|gitude from that day.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time, my attention was wholly engro&s;&s;ed in &s;earch of another mi&s;tre&s;s, and the de&s;ire of being revenged on Melinda, in both which &s;chemes I was very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Billy Chatter, who was &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary creature among the ladies, that in all private dances he engaged the men.&mdash;To him therefore I applied, de&s;iring he would introduce me to a partner of &s;ome figure, at the next private a&s;&s;embly, for the &s;ake of a frolick, the intention of which I would afterwards communicate. Billy, who had heard &s;omething of a difference between Melinda and me, immediately &s;moaked part of my de&s;ign, and think|ing I only wanted to alarm her jealou&s;y a little, promi&s;ed to gratify my de&s;ire, by matching me
<PB N="144" REF="156">
with a partner worth thirty thou&s;and pounds, whom the ladies of this end of the town, had lately taken into their management and protection.&mdash;Upon further inquiry, I found this per&s;on's name was Mi&s;s Biddy Gripewell; that her father, who had been a pawnbroker, died inte&s;tate, by which means all his &s;ub&s;tance de&s;cended to this daughter, who was &s;o little a favourite, that could the old man have prevailed with his own rapacious di&s;|po&s;ition, to part with as much money as would have paid the expence of a will, &s;he would not have inherited the &s;ixth part of his fortune;&mdash;that during his life, &s;o far from being educated in a way &s;uitable to &s;uch great expectations, &s;he was obliged to live like a &s;ervant wench, and do the mo&s;t menial offices in the family.&mdash;But his funeral was no &s;ooner performed, than &s;he a&s;|&s;umed the fine lady, and found &s;o many people of both &s;exes, to flatter, care&s;s and in&s;truct her, that, for want of di&s;cretion and experience, &s;he was grown in&s;ufferably vain and arrogant, and pretended to no le&s;s than a duke or earl at lea&s;t, for her hu&s;band;&mdash;that &s;he had the misfortune to be neglected by the Engli&s;h quality, but a certain poor Scotti&s;h Lord was then making intere&s;t to be introduced to her acquaintance.&mdash;In the mean time, &s;he was fallen into the hands of a notable lady, who had already di&s;po&s;ed of her to a lieu|tenant of foot, a di&s;tant relation of her lady|&s;hip's, though Mi&s;s, as yet, knew nothing of the affair; and la&s;tly, that if I propo&s;ed to dance with her, I mu&s;t give him leave to repre&s;ent me as a knight or foreign count at lea&s;t.&mdash;I was ra|vi&s;hed at this piece of information, and con|tented, for one night, to per&s;onate a French Mar|quis, that I might the ea&s;ier fulfil my revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="157">
Having made the appointment with Chatter, I went to Banter's lodgings, having by this time conceived a great opinion of his penetration and knowledge; and after I had injoined &s;ecrecy, told him every circum&s;tance of my di&s;grace with Me|linda, and imparted the plan I had projected to mortify that proud coquette, de&s;iring his advice in improving, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in executing the &s;cheme.&mdash;Nothing could be more agreeable to his mi|&s;anthropical temper, than an account of her be|haviour and my re&s;entment: He applauded my re&s;olution, and propo&s;ed that I &s;hould not only provide my&s;elf in a proper partner, but al&s;o pro|cure &s;uch an one for Mi&s;s Goo&s;etrap, as would infallibly intail upon her the ridicule of all her ac|quaintance: For this purpo&s;e he mentioned his barber, who, he &s;aid, was an exceeding cox|comb, lately come from Paris, who&s;e ab&s;urd affectation and grimace would ea&s;ily pa&s;s upon her, for the &s;prightly polite&s;&s;e of a gentleman improved by travel.&mdash;I hugged him for this hint; and he a&s;&s;ured me, it would be no difficult mat|ter to make him believe, that Melinda having &s;een him by accident, was captivated by his ap|pearance, and longed for his acquaintance.&mdash;He actually engaged him on this pretence, and painted his good fortune in &s;uch colours, that the poor &s;haver was quite be&s;ide him&s;elf with joy,&mdash;He was immediately fitted with a tawdry &s;uit of cloaths belonging to Banter, and by him re|commended to Chatter, as a very pretty fellow, ju&s;t returned from his travels.&mdash;Ma&s;ter Billy, who acted as gentleman-u&s;her to a great many of the fair &s;ex in and about town undertook, at once, to be&s;peak Melinda in his behalf; and every thing happened according to my wi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="158">
At the time appointed, I appeared, dre&s;&s;ed to the be&s;t advantage; and in the character of Mar|quis, had the honour of opening the ball with the rich heire&s;s, who attracted the eyes of the whole company, by the prodigious number of jewels with which &s;he was adorned.&mdash;Among others, I perceived Melinda, who could no more conceal her envy than a&s;toni&s;hment at my &s;uc|ce&s;s: Her curio&s;ity was &s;till more flagrant and tormenting, for &s;he had never &s;een Mi&s;s Gripe|well before; and Chatter, who alone could give her any &s;atisfaction on that head, was engaged in conver&s;ation at the other end of the room.&mdash;I ob&s;erved her impatience, and exulted in her chagrin; and after my partner was &s;et, took the opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing by her to make a &s;light bow without &s;topping; which compleated my triumph and her indignation. She changed co|lour, bridled up, a&s;&s;umed an air of di&s;dain, and flirted her fan with &s;uch fury, that it went to pieces in a moment, to the no &s;mall entertain|ment of tho&s;e who &s;at near and ob&s;erved her.</P>
<P>At length the metamorpho&s;ed barber took her out, and acted his part with &s;uch ridiculous ex|travagance, that the mirth of the whole com|pany was excited at his expence, and his partner &s;o much a&s;hamed, that before the country dances began, &s;he retired in great confu&s;ion, under pre|tence of being taken &s;uddenly ill, and was fol|lowed by her gallant, who no doubt, imagined her indi&s;po&s;ition was nothing but love; and laid hold of the occa&s;ion of conducting her home, to comfort her, with an a&s;&s;urance of his entertain|ing a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;They were no &s;ooner gone, than an inqui&s;itive whi&s;per of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who is he?"</Q> run round the room; and Cha&s;ter
<PB N="147" REF="159">
could give them no other intelligence about him, than that he was a man of fortune, ju&s;t returned from his travels: I, who alone was ac|quainted with his real quality, affected ignorance, well knowing that female curio&s;ity would not re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;uch a general account, and that the di&s;covery would proceed with a better grace from any body than me.</P>
<P>Mean while, I was tempted by the richne&s;s of the prize, to practi&s;e upon Mi&s;s Gripewell's heart, but &s;oon found it too well fortified with pride and indifference to yield to any efforts in my own character, and I neither would nor could pre&s;erve the title I had borrowed, longer than this night.</P>
<P>As I expected, every thing came to light next day: The barber, in pure &s;implicity of heart, detected him&s;elf to Melinda, and di&s;covered the foundation of his hopes; &s;he &s;ickened at the af|front, and was a&s;hamed to &s;hew her face in pub|lick for many weeks after this accident. Poor Chatter found it impo&s;&s;ible to ju&s;tify him&s;elf to her &s;atisfaction; was in utter di&s;grace with Mi&s;s Gripewell, for having impo&s;ed me upon her as a nobleman; and &s;uffered very much in his character and influence among the ladies in gene|ral.</P>
<P>Finding my finances dimini&s;hed more than one half, and my project as little advanced as on the fir&s;t day of my arrival in town, I began to de&s;pair of my &s;ucce&s;s, and grew melancholy at the pro&s;pect of approaching want.&mdash;To di&s;|pel the horrors of this fiend, I had recour&s;e to the bottle, and kept more company than ever.&mdash;I became particularly attached to the play-hou&s;e, conver&s;ed with the actors behind the &s;cenes, got acquainted with a body of templars, and in a
<PB N="148" REF="160">
&s;hort time commenced a profe&s;&s;ed wit and critick. Indeed I may &s;ay without vanity, that I was much better qualified than any one of my com|panions, who were, generally &s;peaking, of all the creatures I ever conver&s;ed with, the mo&s;t ig|norant and a&s;&s;uming.&mdash;By means of the&s;e avo|cations I got the better of care, and learned to &s;eparate my ideas in &s;uch a manner, that when|ever I was attacked by a gloomy reflection, I could &s;hove it a&s;ide, and call in &s;ome agreeable reverie to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;This was not the ca&s;e with Strap, who practi&s;ed a thou&s;and &s;hifts to conceal the &s;orrow that preyed upon his carca&s;s, and re|duced him to the re&s;emblance of a meer &s;keleton.</P>
<P>While I thus po&s;ted, in a thoughtle&s;s manner, towards poverty, I one day received, by the pen|ny-po&s;t, a letter written in a woman's hand, containing a great many high-flown compliments, warm prote&s;tations of love, couched in a very poeti|cal &s;tile, an earne&s;t de&s;ire of knowing whether or not my heart was engaged, by leaving an an&s;wer at a certain place directed to R. B. and the whole &s;ub|&s;cribed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your incognita."</Q> I was tran&s;ported with joy on reading the contents of this billet doux, which I admired as a ma&s;ter-piece of tenderne&s;s and elegance, and was already up to the ears in love with the author, whom my imagination re|pre&s;ented as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of youth and beauty.&mdash;Elevated with this conjecture, I went to work and exhau&s;ted my invention in compo&s;ing an an&s;wer &s;uitable to the &s;ublimity of her &s;tile, and the ardour of her &s;entiments.&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed my admiration of her wit, in terms the mo&s;t hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged my&s;elf unworthy of her regard, declared my&s;elf enamoured of her under&s;tanding; and in the
<PB N="149" REF="161">
mo&s;t pathetick manner, implored the honour of an interview.&mdash;Having fini&s;hed this performance, and communicated it to Strap, who &s;kipped about for joy, I di&s;patched him with it to the place ap|pointed, which was the hou&s;e of a milliner not far from Bond-&s;treet, and de&s;ired him to keep watch near the door for &s;ome time, that he might di&s;cover the per&s;on who would call for it.&mdash;In le&s;s than an hour he returned, with a joyful countenance, and told me, that &s;oon after he had delivered the letter a chairman was called, to whom it was given, with directions to carry it to the hou&s;e of a rich gentleman in the neighbourhood, whither he (Strap) followed him, and &s;aw it put into the hands of a waiting-wo|man, who paid the me&s;&s;enger and &s;hut the door;&mdash;That upon inquiry at an ale-hou&s;e hard by, where he called for a pint of beer, he under|&s;tood, that the gentleman to whom the hou&s;e be|longed had an only daughter, very hand&s;ome, who would inherit his whole e&s;tate; and who certainly was the author of the billet I had re|ceived.&mdash;I was of the &s;ame opinion, and hug|ing my&s;elf in the happy pro&s;pect, dre&s;&s;ed im|mediately, and pa&s;&s;ed in great &s;tate by the hou&s;e that contained my unknown admirer.&mdash;Nor was my vanity di&s;appointed; for I perceived a beautiful young creature &s;tanding at one of the windows of the dining-room, who, I imagined, ob&s;erved me with more than common curio&s;ity. That I might indulge her view, and at the &s;ame time fea&s;t my own, I affected to &s;top, and give orders to Strap, in the &s;treet, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to her &s;tation, by which means I had an opportunity of &s;eeing her more di&s;tinctly, and of congratulating my&s;elf on having made a conque&s;t of &s;o much perfection.
<PB N="150" REF="162">
&mdash;In a few moments &s;he retired, and I betook my&s;elf to the ordinary, in a rapture of hope, which deprived me of my appetite for that meal, and &s;ent me home in the evening to indulge my con|templation.</P>
<P>Early next day, I was favoured with another epi&s;tle from my unknown charmer, &s;ignifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which, while it made a tender of my heart, convinced her of the value of it. Above all things, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed extreme plea&s;ure in finding me &s;o much attached to her under&s;tanding, a circum&s;tance that not only flattered her in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part, but at the &s;ame time argued my own &s;agacity.&mdash;As for the interview I de&s;ired, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, that I could not be more eager for &s;uch an occa&s;ion than &s;he; but &s;he mu&s;t not only &s;acrifice a little more to decorum, but be &s;atisfied of my ho|nourable intentions, before &s;he would grant that reque&s;t: Mean while, &s;he gave me to under&s;tand, that although &s;he might owe &s;ome deference to the opinion of certain per&s;ons, &s;he was re&s;olved, in an affair that &s;o nearly concerned her happine&s;s, to con&s;ult her own inclination, preferably to the advice of the whole world; e&s;pecially, as &s;he was urged to &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion by no con&s;idera|tion of fortune, what &s;he depended upon, being her own without re&s;triction or controul.&mdash;Struck with admiration at the philo&s;ophy and &s;elf|denial of my mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of the beauty &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and in particular, ra|vi&s;hed with that piece of intelligence, by which I learned her fortune was independent, I re&s;umed the pen, launched out into encomiums on the dignity of her &s;entiments, affected to under|value the charms of external beauty, pretended to

ground my pa&s;&s;ion on the qualities of her mind; complained of her rigour, in &s;acrificing my re|po&s;e to an over&s;crupulous regard to decorum, and declared the purity of my de&s;igns in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and pathetic vows.&mdash;This performance being &s;ealed and directed, was &s;ent to the place appointed, by Strap, who, that we might be &s;till the more confirmed in our belief, renewed his watch, and in a little time brought back the &s;ame information as before, with this addition, that Mi&s;s Sparkle, (the name of my &s;uppo&s;ed cor|re&s;pondent) looking out at the window, no &s;ooner &s;aw the me&s;&s;enger arrive, than &s;he &s;hut the ca&s;e|ment in a &s;ort of beautiful confu&s;ion, and di&s;ap|peared; eager, no doubt, to hear from the dear object of her love.</P>
<P>My doubts now vani&s;hed, the long expected port appeared, and I looked upon my&s;elf as per|fectly &s;ecure of that happine&s;s I had been in que&s;t of &s;o long.&mdash;After dinner, I &s;auntered in com|pany with doctor Wagtail, to that part of the town in which my inamorata lived; and as he was a meer regi&s;ter, enquired of him into the name, character and fortune of every body who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good hou&s;e in the &s;treets through which we pa&s;&s;ed: When it came to his turn to mention Sir John Sparkle, he repre&s;ented him as a man of an immen&s;e e&s;tate and narrow di&s;po&s;ition, who mewed up his only child, a fine young lady, from the conver&s;ation of mankind, under the &s;trict watch and in&s;pection of an old gouvernante, who was either &s;o hone&s;t, envious or in&s;atiable, that no body had been, as yet, able to make her a friend, or get acce&s;s to her charge, though num|bers attempted it every day; not &s;o much on account of her expectations from her father,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BAFFLED hitherto in my matrimonial &s;chemes, I began to que&s;tion my talents for the &s;cience of fortune-hunting, and to bend my thoughts towards &s;ome employment under the government.&mdash;With the view of procuring which, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords

Straddle and Swillpot, who&s;e fathers were men of intere&s;t at court.&mdash;I found the&s;e young noblemen as open to my advances as I could de&s;ire: I accom|panied them in their midnight rambles, and often dined with them at taverns, where I had the ho|nour of paying the reckoning.</P>
<P>I one day took the opportunity, while I was loaded with prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, to di&s;clo&s;e my de&s;ire of being &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;ine-cure; and to &s;olicit their influence in my behalf.&mdash;Swillpot &s;queezing my hand, &s;aid, I might depend upon his &s;ervice, by G&mdash;d. The other &s;wore that no man would be more proud than he to run my errands. Encouraged by the&s;e declara|tions I ventured to expre&s;s an inclination to be introduced to their fathers, who were able to do my bu&s;ine&s;s at once. Swillpot frankly owned he had not &s;poke to his father the&s;e three years; and Straddle a&s;&s;ured me his father having lately di&s;obliged the Mini&s;ter by &s;ub&s;cribing his name to a prote&s;t in the hou&s;e of peers, was thereby ren|dered incapable of &s;erving his friends at pre&s;ent; but he undertook to make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell, who was hand and glove with a certain per&s;on that ruled the roa&s;t. This offer I embraced with many acknowledgments, and plied him &s;o clo&s;ely, in &s;pite of a thou&s;and eva&s;ions, that he found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping his word, and actually carried me to the levee of this great man, where he left me in a crowd of fellow-dependants, and was u&s;hered to a parti|cular clo&s;et audience; from whence in a few mi|nutes, he returned with his lord&s;hip, who took me by the hand, a&s;&s;ured me he would do me all the &s;ervice he could, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me often.&mdash;I was charmed with my reception, and al|though

I had heard that a courtier's promi&s;e is not to be depended upon, I thought I di&s;covered &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s of temper and candour in this Earl's countenance, that I did not doubt of pro|fiting by his protection.&mdash;I re&s;olved therefore, to avail my&s;elf of his permi&s;&s;ion, and waited on him next audience day, when I was favoured with a particular &s;mile, &s;queeze of the hand, and a whi&s;|per, &s;ignifying that he wanted half an hour's con|ver&s;ation with me <HI>t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te,</HI> when he &s;hould be di&s;engaged, and for that purpo&s;e de&s;ired me to come and drink a di&s;h of chocolate with him to|morrow morning.&mdash;This invitation, which did not a little flatter my vanity and expectation, I took care to ob&s;erve, and went to his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e at the time appointed. Having rapped at the gate, the porter unbolted and kept it half open, placing him&s;elf in the gap, like &s;oldiers in a breach, to di&s;pute my pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;I demanded to know if his lord was &s;tirring?&mdash;He an&s;wered with a &s;urly a&s;pect, <Q REND="inline">"No."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At what hour does he commonly ri&s;e?

The grim janitor re|lented at the touch of my money, which he took with all the indifference of a tax-gatherer, and &s;hewed me into a parlour, where, he &s;aid, I might amu&s;e my&s;elf till &s;uch time as his lord

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Was &s;o confounded that I could make no re|ply to Banter, who reproached me with great indignation, for having thrown away upon ra&s;cals, that which, had it been converted into ready money, would have &s;upported the rank of a gentleman for &s;ome months, and enabled me, at the &s;ame time, to oblige my friends.&mdash;Stupified as I was, I could ea&s;ily divine the &s;ource of his concern, but &s;neaked away in a &s;olitary manner, without yielding the lea&s;t an&s;wer to his
<PB N="170" REF="182">
expo&s;tulations; and began to deliberate with my|&s;elf, in what manner I &s;hould attempt to retrieve the moveables I had &s;o fooli&s;hly lo&s;t.&mdash;I would have thought it no robbery to take them again by force, could I have done it without any danger of being detected; but as I could have no &s;uch opportunity, I re&s;olved to work by fine&s;&s;e, and go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle, where I was &s;o fortunate as to find him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Lord, (&s;aid I) I have ju&s;t now recollected, that the diamond I had the honour of pre&s;enting to you, is loo&s;ened a little in the &s;ocket, and there is a young fellow ju&s;t arrived from Paris, who is reckoned the be&s;t jeweller in Europe; I knew him in France, and if your lord&s;hip will give me leave, will carry the ring to him to be &s;et to rights."&mdash;</Q>His lord&s;hip was not to be caught in this &s;nare&mdash;he thanked me for my offer, and let me know, that having him&s;elf ob|&s;erved the defect, he had already &s;ent it to his own jeweller to be mended.&mdash;And indeed, by this time, I believe it was in the jeweller's hands, though not in order to be mended, for it &s;tood in need of no alteration.</P>
<P>Baulked in this piece of politicks, I cur&s;ed my &s;implicity; but re&s;olved to play a &s;urer game with the Earl, which I had thus devi&s;ed.&mdash;I did not doubt of being admitted into familiar con|ver&s;ation with him, as before, and hoped by &s;ome means, to get the watch into my hand, then on pretence of winding or playing with it, drop it on the floor, which in all probability would di&s;|order the work &s;o as to &s;top its motion: This event would furni&s;h me with an opportunity of in&s;i&s;ting upon carrying it away in order to be repaired; and had this happened, I &s;hould have
<PB N="171" REF="183">
been in no hurry to bring it back.&mdash;What pity it was I could not find an occa&s;ion of put|ting this fine &s;cheme in execution! When I went to renew my vi&s;it to his lord&s;hip, my ac|ce&s;s to the parlour was as free as ever; but af|ter I had waited &s;ome time, the <HI>valet de chambre</HI> came in with his Lord's compliments, and a de&s;ire to &s;ee me to-morrow at his lev&eacute;e, being at pre&s;ent &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed that he could not &s;ee company.&mdash;I interpreted this me&s;&s;age into a bad omen, and came away muttering cur&s;es a|gain&s;t his lord&s;hip's politene&s;s, and ready to go to loggerheads with my&s;elf for being &s;o egre|giou&s;ly duped.&mdash;But that I might have &s;ome &s;a|tisfaction for the lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tained, I be&s;ieged him clo&s;ely at his lev&eacute;e, and per&s;ecuted him with my &s;olicitations; not without faint hopes indeed, of reaping &s;omething more from my indu&s;try, than the bare plea&s;ure of making him unea&s;y; though I could never obtain another private hearing, during the whole cour&s;e of my atten|dance; neither had I re&s;olution enough, to un|deceive Strap, who&s;e looks in a little time, were &s;o whetted with impatience, that whenever I came home, his eyes devoured me, as it were, with eagerne&s;s of attention.</P>
<P>At length, however, finding my&s;elf reduced to my la&s;t guinea, I was compelled to di&s;clo&s;e my nece&s;&s;ity, though I endeavoured to &s;weeten the di&s;covery by rehear&s;ing to him the daily a&s;|&s;urances I received from my patron.&mdash;But the&s;e promi&s;es were not of efficacy &s;ufficient to &s;upport the &s;pirits of my friend, who no &s;ooner under&s;tood the lowne&s;s of my finances, than ut|tering a dreadful groan, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the name of God, what &s;hall we do?"&mdash;</Q>In or|der
<PB N="172" REF="184">
to comfort him, I &s;aid that many of my ac|quaintance, who were in a wor&s;e condition than we, &s;upported, notwith&s;tanding, the character and appearance of gentlemen; and advi&s;ing him to thank God that we had as yet incurred no debt, propo&s;ed he &s;hould pawn my &s;word of &s;teel inlaid with gold, and tru&s;t to my di&s;cretion for the re&s;t. This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap, who, in &s;pite of his invincible affection for me, &s;till retained notions of oeconomy and expence &s;uitable to the narrowne&s;s of his edu|cation; neverthele&s;s he complied with my reque&s;t, and rai&s;ed &s;even pieces on the &s;word in a twinkling.&mdash;This &s;upply, incon&s;iderable as it was, made me as happy for the pre&s;ent, as if I had had five hundred pounds in bank; for by this time I was &s;o well &s;killed in procra&s;tinating every trouble|&s;ome reflection, that the pro&s;pect of want &s;eldom affected me very much, let it be ever &s;o near.&mdash;And now indeed it was nearer than I imagined; for my landlord having occa&s;ion for money, put me in mind of my being indebted to him five guineas in lodging; and telling me he had a &s;um to make up, begged I would excu&s;e his impor|tunity and di&s;charge the debt. Though I could ill &s;pare &s;o much ca&s;h; my pride took the re&s;o|lution of di&s;bur&s;ing it, which I did in a cavalier manner, after he had written a di&s;charge, telling him with an air of &s;corn and re&s;entment, I &s;aw he was re&s;olved that I &s;hould not be long in his books; while Strap, who &s;tood by, and knew my circum&s;tances, wrung his hands in &s;ecret, gnawed his nether lip, and turned yellow with de&s;pair.&mdash;Whatever appearance of indifference my vanity enabled me to put on, I was thunder|&s;truck with this demand, which I had no &s;ooner
<PB N="173" REF="185">
&s;atisfied, than I ha&s;tened into company, with a view of beguiling my cares with conver&s;ation, or of drowning them in wine.</P>
<P>After dinner, a party was accordingly made in the coffee-hou&s;e, from whence we adjourned to the tavern, where in&s;tead of &s;haring the mirth of the company, I was as much chagrined at their good humour as a damned &s;oul in hell would be at a glimp&s;e of heaven.&mdash;In vain did I &s;wallow bumper after bumper! the wine had lo&s;t its effect upon me, and &s;o far from rai&s;ing my dejected &s;pirits, could not even lay me a&s;leep.&mdash;Banter, who was the only intimate I had (Strap excepted) perceived my anxiety, and when we broke up, reproached me with pu&s;ilanimity, for being ca&s;t down at any di&s;appointment that &s;uch a ra&s;cal as Strutwell could be the occa&s;ion of.&mdash;I told him I did not at all &s;ee how Strutwell's being a ra&s;cal alleviated my misfortune; and gave him to un|der&s;tand that my pre&s;ent grief did not &s;o much proceed from that di&s;appointment, as from the low ebb of my fortune, which was &s;unk to &s;omething le&s;s than two guineas.&mdash;At this decla|ration, he cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"P&s;haw! is that all?"</Q> and a&s;&s;ured me, there were a thou&s;and ways of living in town without fortune, he him&s;elf having &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed many years entirely by his wit.&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed an eager de&s;ire of being acquainted with &s;ome of the&s;e methods, and he, without further expo&s;tu|lation, bid me follow him.&mdash;He conducted me to a hou&s;e under the piazzas in Convent Garden, which we entered, and having delivered our &s;words to a grim fellow who demanded them at the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, a&s;cended to the &s;econd &s;tory, where I &s;aw multitudes of people &s;tanding round two gaming tables, loaded in a manner,
<PB N="174" REF="186">
with gold and &s;ilver.&mdash;My conductor let me know that this was the hou&s;e of a worthy Scotch Lord, who availing him&s;elf of the privilege of his peerage, had &s;et up publick gaming tables, from the profits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood.&mdash;He then explained the difference be|tween the <HI>&s;itters</HI> and the <HI>betters;</HI> characterized the fir&s;t as old rooks, and the la&s;t as bubbles; and advi&s;ed me to try my fortune at the &s;ilver table by betting a crown at a time.&mdash;Before I would venture any thing, I con&s;idered the com|pany more particularly, and there appeared &s;uch a groupe of villainous faces, that I was &s;truck with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight! I &s;ignified my &s;urprize to Banter, who whi&s;pered in my ear, that the bulk of tho&s;e pre&s;ent were compo&s;ed of &s;harpers, highwaymen, and appren|tices, who having embezzled their ma&s;ter's ca&s;h, made a de&s;perate pu&s;h in this place, to make up their deficiencies.&mdash;This account did not encou|rage me to hazard any part of my &s;mall pittance; but at length being teized by the importunities of my friend, who a&s;&s;ured me there was no danger of being ill u&s;ed, people being hired by the owner to &s;ee ju&s;tice done to every body; I began by ri&s;quing one &s;hilling, and in le&s;s than an hour, my winning amounted to thirty.&mdash;Convinced by this time of the fairne&s;s of the game, and ani|mated with &s;ucce&s;s, there was no need of further per&s;ua&s;ion to continue the play: I lent Banter (who &s;eldom had any money in his pocket) a guinea, which he carried to the gold table and lo&s;t in a moment.&mdash;He would have borrowed another, but finding me deaf to his arguments, went away in a pet.&mdash;Mean while my gain ad|vanced to &s;ix pieces, and my de&s;ire of more in|crea&s;ed

in proportion; &s;o that I moved to the higher table, where I laid half a guinea on every throw, and fortune &s;till favouring me, I became a &s;itter, in which capacity I remained until it was broad day; when I found my&s;elf, after many vici&s;&s;itudes, one hundred and fifty guineas in pocket.</P>
<P>Thinking it now high time to retire with my booty, I a&s;ked if any body would take my place, and made a motion to ri&s;e; upon which an old ga&s;con, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to me, and of whom I had won a little money, &s;tarted up with fury in his looks, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Re&s;tez foutre, re&s;tez, il faut donner moi mon ravanchio!</HI>"</Q> At the &s;ame time, a Jew who &s;at near the other, in&s;inuated that I was more beholden to art than fortune, for what I had got; that he had ob&s;erved me wipe the table very often, and that &s;ome of the divi&s;ions &s;eemed to be grea&s;y. This intimation produced a great deal of clamour again&s;t me, e&s;pecially among the lo&s;ers, who threatned with many oaths and imprecations to take me up by a warrant as a a &s;harper, unle&s;s I would compromi&s;e the affair by refunding the greate&s;t part of my winning.&mdash;Though I was far from being ea&s;y under this ac|cu&s;ation, I relied upon my innocence, threatned in my turn to pro&s;ecute the Jew for defamation, and boldly offered to &s;ubmit my cau&s;e to the exa|mination of any ju&s;tice in We&s;tmin&s;ter; but they knew them&s;elves too well to put their characters on that i&s;&s;ue, and finding I was not to be inti|midated into any conce&s;&s;ion, dropt their plea, and made way for me to withdraw.&mdash;I would not however, &s;tir from the table until the I&s;raelite had retracted what he &s;aid to my di&s;advantage, and a&s;ked pardon before the whole a&s;&s;embly.</P>

<P>Since my la&s;t arrival in London, I had made no advances to the apothecary, imagining it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to make my innocence ap|pear, &s;o unhappily was my accu&s;ation circum|&s;tanced: Strap indeed had laboured to ju&s;tify me to the &s;choolma&s;ter; but &s;o far from &s;ucceeding in his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropt all cor|re&s;pondence with him, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to quit his connexion with me.&mdash;Things being in this &s;ituation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vin|dicating my character could not offer, than that which now pre&s;ented it&s;elf;&mdash;therefore &s;tipulated with Mrs. Gawkey, that before I yielded her the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he &s;hould do me the ju&s;tice to clear my reputation, by explaining upon oath be|fore a Magi&s;trate, the whole of the con&s;piracy, as it had been executed again&s;t me.&mdash;When &s;he had given me this &s;atisfaction, I pre&s;ented her with

<P>I purcha&s;e new cloaths&mdash;reprimand Strut|well and Straddle&mdash;Banter propo&s;es ano|ther matrimonial &s;cheme&mdash;I accept of his terms&mdash;&s;et out for Bath in a &s;tage|coach, with the young lady and her mo|ther&mdash;the behaviour of an officer and lawyer, our fellow-travellers, de&s;cribed&mdash;a &s;mart dialogue between my mi&s;tre&s;s and the captain.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed this affair to my &s;atisfac|tion, I found my&s;elf perfectly at ea&s;e, and looking upon the gaming-table as a certain re&s;ource for a gentleman in want, became more gay than ever.&mdash;Although my cloaths were almo&s;t as good as new, I grew a&s;hamed of wearing them, becau&s;e I thought every body, by this time, had
<PB N="182" REF="194">
got an inventory of my wardrobe.&mdash;For which rea&s;on, I di&s;po&s;ed of a good part of my apparel to a &s;ale&s;man in Monmouth-&s;treet, for half the value, and bought two new &s;uits with the money. I likewi&s;e purcha&s;ed a plain gold watch, de&s;pair|ing of recovering that which I had &s;o fooli&s;hly given to Strutwell, whom, notwith&s;tanding, I &s;till continued to vi&s;it at his lev&eacute;e, until the em|ba&s;&s;ador he had mentioned, &s;et out with a &s;ecre|tary of his own chu&s;ing.&mdash;I thought my&s;elf then at liberty to expo&s;tulate with his lord&s;hip, whom I treated with great freedom in a letter, for amu&s;ing me with vain hopes, when he neither had the power nor inclination to provide for me.&mdash;Nor was I le&s;s re&s;erved with Straddle, whom I in per&s;on reproached for mi&s;repre&s;enting to me the character of Strutwell, which I did not &s;cruple to aver was infamous in every re&s;pect.&mdash;He &s;eemed very much enraged at my freedom, talked a great deal about his quality and honour, and began to make &s;ome compari&s;ons which I thought &s;o injurious to mine, that I demanded an explanation with great warmth; and he was mean enough to equivocate, and conde&s;cend in &s;uch a manner, that I left him with a hearty contempt of his behaviour.</P>
<P>About this time, Banter, who had ob&s;erved a &s;urprizing and &s;udden alteration in my appearance and di&s;po&s;ition, began to enquire very minutely into the cau&s;e; and as I did not think fit to let him know the true &s;tate of the affair, le&s;t he might make free with my pur&s;e, on the &s;trength of having propo&s;ed the &s;cheme that filled it, I told him that I had received a &s;mall &s;upply from a relation in the country, who at the &s;ame time had promi&s;ed to u&s;e all his intere&s;t (which was not
<PB N="183" REF="195">
&s;mall) in &s;olliciting &s;ome po&s;t for me that would make me ea&s;y for life.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that be the ca&s;e (&s;aid Banter) perhaps you won't care to mor|tify your&s;elf a little, in making your fortune another way.&mdash;I have a relation who is to &s;et out for Bath next week, with an only daugh|ter, who being &s;ickly and decrepid, intends to drink the waters for the recovery of her health.&mdash;Her father, who was a rich Turkey mer|chant, died about a year ago, and left her with a fortune of twenty thou&s;and pounds, under the &s;ole management of her mother, who is my kin&s;woman.&mdash;I would have put in for the plate my&s;elf, but there is a breach at pre&s;ent between the old woman and me.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, that &s;ome time ago I bor|rowed a &s;mall &s;um of her, and promi&s;ed, it &s;eems, to pay it before a certain time; but be|ing di&s;appointed in my expectation of money from the country, the day clap&s;ed, without my being able to take up my note; upon which &s;he wrote a peremptory letter, threat|ning to arre&s;t me, if I did not pay the debt immediately: Nettled at this preci&s;e behaviour, I &s;ent a damned &s;evere an&s;wer, which enraged her &s;o much, that &s;he actually took out a writ again&s;t me.&mdash;Whereupon, finding the thing grow &s;erious, I got a friend to advance the money for me, di&s;charged the debt, went to her hou&s;e, and abu&s;ed her for unfriendly deal|ing.&mdash;She was provoked by my reproaches, and &s;colded in her turn. The little deformed urchin joined her mother with &s;uch virulence and vo|lubility of tongue, that I was fain to make my retreat, after having been honoured with a great many &s;candalous epithets, which gave
<PB N="184" REF="196">
me plainly to under&s;tand that I had nothing to hope from the e&s;teem of the one, or the af|fection of the other.&mdash;As they are both utter &s;trangers to life, it is a thou&s;and to one that the girl &s;hall be picked up by &s;ome &s;coundrel or other at Bath, if I don't provide for her otherwi&s;e.&mdash;You are a well-looking &s;ellow, Random, and can behave as demurely as a quaker.&mdash;Now if you will give me an obliga|tion for five hundred pounds, to be paid &s;ix months after your marriage, I will put you in a method of carrying her in &s;pite of all op|po&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P>This propo&s;al was too advantageous for me, to be refu&s;ed: The writing was immediately drawn and executed; and Banter giving me no|tice of the time when, and the &s;tage-coach in which they were to &s;et out, I be&s;poke a place in the &s;ame convenience; and having hired a hor&s;e for Strap, who was charmed with the project, &s;et out accordingly.</P>
<P>As we embarked before day, I had not the plea&s;ure for &s;ome time of &s;eeing Mi&s;s Snapper (that was the name of my mi&s;tre&s;s) nor even of perceiving the number and &s;ex of my fellow|travellers, although I gue&s;&s;ed that the coach was full, by the difficulty I found in &s;eating my&s;elf.&mdash;The fir&s;t five minutes pa&s;&s;ed in a general &s;ilence, when all of a &s;udden, the coach heeling to one &s;ide, a boi&s;terous voice pronounced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To the right and left, cover your flanks, damme!"</Q> I ea&s;ily di&s;covered by the tone and matter of this exclamation, that it was uttered by a &s;on of Mars; neither was it hard to conceive the profe&s;&s;ion of another per&s;on, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to me, and ob|&s;erved, that we ought to have been well &s;atisfied of

Nettled at her remarks, I took the &s;ame me|thod of conveying my &s;entiments, and wondered in my turn, that any woman of common &s;en&s;e, &s;hould be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to expect that people who had neither acquaintance nor connexion with her, would tamely allow them&s;elves to be robbed and mal-treated, meerly to indulge her capricious humour.

<P>This per&s;on of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation any further, but &s;eemed to chew the cud of her re&s;entment, with the cre&s;t|fallen captain, while I entered into di&s;cour&s;e with my charmer, who was the more plea&s;ed with my conver&s;ation, as &s;he had conceived a very in|different opinion of my intellects from my for|mer &s;ilence.

However, when I con&s;idered on the o|ther hand, the joys attending the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of twenty thou&s;and pounds, I forgot her imperfec|tions, &s;eized occa&s;ion by the fore-lock, and en|deavoured to in&s;inuate my&s;elf into her affection.&mdash;The careful mother kept a &s;trict watch over her, and though &s;he could not help behaving civilly to me, took frequent opportunities of di&s;|couraging our communication, by reprimanding

on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;s Snapper, whom the one repre&s;ented as unworthy of my notice, and the other propo&s;ed as the object of my whole at|tention: The advantages and di&s;advantages at|tending &s;uch a match, were oppo&s;ed to one a|nother by my imagination; and at length, my judgment gave it &s;o much in favour of the fir&s;t, that I re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute my &s;cheme, with all the addre&s;s in my power.&mdash;I thought I perceived &s;ome concern in her countenance, occa&s;ioned by my &s;ilence, which &s;he no doubt imputed to my di&s;gu&s;t at her mother's behaviour; and as I be|lieved the old woman could not fail of a&s;cribing my mutene&s;s to the &s;ame motive, I determined to continue that &s;ullen conduct towards her, and fall upon &s;ome other method of manife&s;ting my e&s;teem for the daughter; nor was it difficult for me to make her acquainted with my &s;entiments by the expre&s;&s;ion of my looks, which I modelled into the characters of humility and love; and which were an&s;wered by her with all the &s;ympathy and approbation I could de&s;ire.

and though &s;he &s;till behaved with a par|ticular civility to me, I fore&s;aw that as &s;oon as her fortune &s;hould be known, &s;he would be &s;urrounded with a &s;warm of admirers, &s;ome one of whom might po&s;&s;ibly, by excelling me in point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery and &s;candal, &s;upplant me in her e&s;teem, and find means to make the mother of his party.&mdash;I re|&s;olved therefore to lo&s;e no time, and being in|vited to &s;pend the evening with them, found an opportunity, in &s;pite of the old gentlewoman's vi|gilance, to explain the meaning of my glances in the coach, by paying homage to her wit, and profe&s;&s;ing my&s;elf enamoured of her per&s;on.&mdash;She blu&s;hed at my declaration, and in a favour|able manner di&s;approved of the liberty I had taken, putting me in mind of our being &s;trangers to one another, and de&s;iring I would not be the means of interrupting our acquaintance, by any &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable &s;trokes of gallantry for the future.&mdash;My ardour was effectually checked by this repri|mand, which was, however, delivered in &s;uch a gentle manner, that I had no cau&s;e to be di&s;o|bliged; and the arrival of her mother relieved me from a dilemma in which I &s;hould not have known how to demean my&s;elf a minute longer.&mdash;Neither could I re&s;ume the ea&s;ine&s;s of carriage with which I came in, my mi&s;tre&s;s acted on the re&s;erve, and the conver&s;ation beginning to flag, the old lady introduced her kin&s;woman of the hou&s;e, and propo&s;ed a hand at whi&s;t.</P>
<P>While we amu&s;ed our&s;elves at this diver&s;ion, I under&s;tood from the gentlewoman, that there was to be an a&s;&s;embly next night, at which I begged to have the honour of dancing with Mi&s;s. She thanked me for the favour I intended her, a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he

<P>Having &s;upped, and continued the game, till &s;uch time as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive yawns of the mother warned me to begone, I took my leave, and went home, where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progre&s;s.&mdash;Next day I put on my gaye&s;t apparel, and went to drink tea at Mrs. Snapper's, according to appointment, when I found, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, that &s;he was laid up with the tooth-ach, and that Mi&s;s was to be intru&s;ted to my care.&mdash;Accord|ingly, we &s;et out for the ball-room, pretty early in the evening, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a commo|dious place, where we had not &s;at longer than a quarter of an hour, when a gentleman dre&s;&s;ed in a green frock came in, leading a young lady, whom I immediately di&s;covered to be the adorable Narci&s;&s;a!

<P>IN the afternoon, I drank tea at the hou&s;e of Mr. Freeman, to whom I had been recom|mended by Banter; where I had not &s;at five minutes, 'till the fox-hunter came in, and by his familiar behaviour, appeared to be intimate with my friend&mdash;I was, at fir&s;t, under &s;ome concern, le&s;t he &s;hould recollect my features; but when I found my&s;elf introduced to him as a gentleman from London, without being di&s;covered, I ble&s;&s;ed the opportunity that brought me into his company; hoping, that in the cour&s;e of our ac|quaintance, he would invite me to his hou&s;e&mdash;nor were my hopes fru&s;trated, for as we &s;pent the evening together, he grew extremely fond of my conver&s;ation, a&s;ked a great many childi&s;h que&s;tions about France and foreign parts; and

&s;eemed &s;o highly entertained with my an&s;wers, that in his cups, he &s;hook me often by the hand, pronounced me an hone&s;t fellow, and in fine, de|&s;ired our company at dinner next day, in his own hou&s;e.&mdash;My imagination was &s;o much em|ployed in anticipating the happine&s;s I was to en|joy next day, that I &s;lept very little that night; but getting up early in the morning, went to the place appointed, where I met my &s;he-friend, and imparted to her my &s;ucce&s;s with the &s;quire&mdash;She was very much plea&s;ed at the occa&s;ion, which (&s;he &s;aid) could not fail of being agreeable to Narci&s;&s;a, who in &s;pite of her pa&s;&s;ion for me, had mentioned &s;ome &s;cruples relating to my true &s;ituation and character, which the delicacy of her &s;entiments &s;ugge&s;ted, and which &s;he believed I would find it nece&s;&s;ary to remove, though &s;he did not know how.&mdash;I was a good deal &s;tartled at this in&s;inuation, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw the difficulty I &s;hould find in barely doing my&s;elf ju&s;tice; for although it never was my intention to impo&s;e my|&s;elf upon any woman, much le&s;s on Narci&s;&s;a, as a man of fortune, I laid claim to the character of a gentleman, by birth, education and behaviour; and yet (&s;o unlucky had the circum&s;tances of my life fallen out) I &s;hould find it a very hard matter to make good my preten&s;ions even to the&s;e, e&s;|pecially to the la&s;t, which was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential&mdash;Mi&s;s Williams was as &s;en&s;ible as I, of this my di&s;|advantage; but comforted me with ob&s;erving, that when once a woman has be&s;towed her af|fections on a man, &s;he cannot help judging of him in all re&s;pects, with a partiality ea&s;ily in|fluenced in his favour;&mdash;&s;he remarked that altho' &s;ome &s;ituations of my life had been low, yet none of them had been infamous; that my indigence

had been the crime not of me, but of fortune; and that the mi&s;eries I had undergone, by im|proving the faculties both of mind and body, qualified me the more for any dignified &s;tation; and would of con&s;equence, recommend me to the good graces of any &s;en&s;ible woman;&mdash;&s;he therefore advi&s;ed me to be always open and unre&s;erved to the inquiries of my mi&s;tre&s;s, without unnece&s;|&s;arily betraying the meane&s;t occurrences of my fate; and tru&s;t to the &s;trength of her love and re|flection, for the re&s;t.&mdash;The &s;entiments of this &s;en&s;ible young woman on this, as well as on al|mo&s;t every other &s;ubject, perfectly agreed with mine; I thanked her for the care &s;he took of my intere&s;ts, and promi&s;ing to behave my&s;elf accord|ing to her direction, we parted, after &s;he had a&s;&s;ured me, that I might depend upon her be&s;t offices with her mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;he would front time to time, communicate to me &s;uch intelli|gence as &s;he could procure, relating to my flame.&mdash;Having dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the be&s;t advantage, I waited for the time of dinner with the mo&s;t fear|ful impatience; and as the hour drew nigh, my heart beat with &s;uch increa&s;ed velocity, and my &s;pirits contracted &s;uch di&s;order, that I began to &s;u&s;pect my re&s;olution, and even to wi&s;h my&s;elf di&s;engaged:&mdash;At la&s;t Mr. Freeman called at my lodgings, in his way, and I accompanied him to the hou&s;e where all my happine&s;s was depo&s;ited.&mdash;We were very kindly received by the &s;quire, who &s;at &s;moaking his pipe in a parlour, and a&s;ked if we cho&s;e to drink any thing before dinner; tho' I never had more occa&s;ion for a cordial, I was a&s;hamed to accept his offer, which was al&s;o refu&s;ed by my friend.

<P>I Was met next morning, at the u&s;ual place by Mi&s;s Williams, who gave me joy of the progre&s;s I had made in the affection of her mi&s;tre&s;s, and ble&s;&s;ed me with an account of that dear creature's conver&s;ation with her, after &s;he had retired the night before from our company.&mdash;I could &s;carce believe her information, when &s;he recounted her expre&s;&s;ions in my favour, &s;o much more warm and pa&s;&s;ionate were they than my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes had pre&s;aged; and was par|ticularly plea&s;ed to hear that &s;he approved of my behaviour to her brother, after &s;he withdrew.&mdash;
<PB N="227" REF="241">
Tran&s;ported at the news of my happine&s;s, I pre&s;ented my ring to the me&s;&s;enger, as a te&s;timo|ny of my gratitude and &s;atisfaction; but &s;he was above &s;uch mercenary con&s;iderations, and refu&s;ed my compliment with &s;ome re&s;entment, &s;aying, &s;he was not a little mortified to &s;ee my opinion of her &s;o low and contemptible.&mdash;I did my&s;elf a piece of ju&s;tice by explaining my behaviour on this head, and to convince her of my e&s;teem, promi&s;ed to be ruled by her directions in the pro|&s;ecution of the whole affair, which I had &s;o much at heart, that the repo&s;e of my life de|pended upon the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>As I fervently wi&s;hed for another interview, where I might pour out the effu&s;ions of my love, without danger of being interrupted, and per|haps reap &s;ome endearing return from the queen of my de&s;ires, I implored her advice and a&s;&s;i&s;|tance in promoting this event;&mdash;but &s;he gave me to under&s;tand, that Narci&s;&s;a would make no pre|cipitate compliances of this kind, and that I would do well to cultivate her brother's acquain|tance, in the cour&s;e of which, I would not want opportunities of removing that re&s;erve, which my mi&s;tre&s;s thought her&s;elf obliged to maintain during the infancy of our corre&s;pondence.&mdash;In the mean time, &s;he promi&s;ed to tell her lady that I had endeavoured by pre&s;ents and per&s;ua&s;ions, to prevail upon her, (Mi&s;s Williams) to deliver a letter from me, which &s;he had refu&s;ed to charge her&s;elf with, until &s;he &s;hould know Narci&s;&s;a's &s;entiments of the matter; and &s;aid, by the&s;e means &s;he did not doubt of being able to open a literary communication between us, which could not fail of introducing more intimate connexions.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="242">
I approved of her coun&s;el, and our appoint|ment being renewed for next day, left her with an intent of falling upon &s;ome method of being re|conciled to the Squire, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, would be offended with the trick we had put upon him.&mdash;With this view, I con&s;ulted Freeman, who from his knowledge of the Fox-hunter's di&s;|po&s;ition, a&s;&s;ured me there was no other me|thod of pacifying him, than that of &s;acrificing our&s;elves for one night, to an equal match with him in drinking: This I found my&s;elf nece&s;&s;i|tated to comply with, for the intere&s;t of my pa&s;|&s;ion, and therefore determined to commit the debauch at my own lodgings, that I might run no ri&s;k of being di&s;covered by Narci&s;&s;a, in a &s;tate of brutal degeneracy.&mdash;Mr. Freeman, who was to be of the party, went, at my de&s;ire, to the Squire in order to engage him, while I took care to furni&s;h my&s;elf for his reception.&mdash;My invita|tion was accepted, my gue&s;ts honoured me with their company in the evening, when Bruin gave me to under&s;tand that he had drank many tuns of wine in his life, but was never &s;erved &s;uch a trick as I had played upon him the night before. I promi&s;ed to atone for my tre&s;pa&s;s, and having ordered to every man his bottle, began the con|te&s;t with a bumper to the health of Narci&s;&s;a.&mdash;The toa&s;ts circulated with great devotion, the liquor began to operate, our mirth grew noi&s;y, and as Freeman and I had the advantage of drinking &s;mall French claret, the &s;avage was ef|fectually tamed before our &s;en&s;es were in the lea&s;t affected, and carried home in a kind of apo|plexy of drunkenne&s;s.</P>

Having fini&s;hed this effu&s;ion, I committed it to the care of my faithful friend, with an injunction to &s;econd my intreaty with all her eloquence and influence; and in the mean time went to dre&s;s, with an intention of vi&s;iting Mrs. Snapper and Mi&s;s, whom I had utterly neglected and indeed almo&s;t forgot, &s;ince my dear Narci&s;&s;a had re&s;umed the empire of my &s;oul.

<P>No Anchorite in the ex&s;ta&s;y of devotion, ever adored a relique with more fervour than that with which I ki&s;&s;ed this inimitable proof of my charmer's candour, genero&s;ity and affection! I read it over an hundred times; was ravi&s;hed with her confe&s;&s;ion in the beginning; but the &s;ub|&s;cription of YOUR NARCISSA, yielded me &s;uch delight as I had never felt before! My happine&s;s was &s;till increa&s;ed by Mi&s;s Williams, who ble&s;&s;ed me with a repetition of her lady's tender expre&s;|&s;ions in my favour, when &s;he received and read my letter.&mdash;In &s;hort, I had all the rea&s;on in the world to believe that this gentle creature's bo&s;om was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a pa&s;&s;ion for me, as warm,

though perhaps not &s;o impetuous, as mine for her.</P>
<P>I informed my friend of the Squire's con&s;ent, with regard to my dancing with Narci&s;&s;a at the ball, and de&s;ired her to tell her mi&s;tre&s;s, that I would do my&s;elf the honour of vi&s;iting her in the afternoon, in con&s;equence of his permi&s;&s;ion, when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her brother had been complai&s;ant in that particular.&mdash;Mi&s;s Williams expre&s;&s;ed a good deal of joy, at hearing I was &s;o much in favour with the fox-hunter, and ventured to a&s;&s;ure me, that my vi&s;it would be very agreeable to my mi&s;tre&s;s, the rather becau&s;e Bruin was engaged to dine abroad.&mdash;This was a circum&s;tance, which I &s;carce need &s;ay, plea&s;ed me.&mdash;I went immediately to the long-room, where I found him, and af|fecting to know nothing of his engagement, told him, I would do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to wait upon him in the afternoon, and to pre&s;ent his &s;i&s;ter with a ticket for the ball.&mdash;He &s;hook me by the hand, according to cu&s;tom, and giving me to under&s;tand that he was to dine abroad, de&s;ired me to go and drink tea with Narci&s;&s;a notwith&s;tanding, and promi&s;ed to prepare her for my vi&s;it in the mean time.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;ucceeding thus to my wi&s;h, I waited with incredible patience for the time, which no &s;ooner arrived, than I ha&s;tened to the &s;cene, which my fancy had pre-occupied long be|fore.&mdash;I was introduced accordingly, to the dear enchantre&s;s, whom I found accompanied by Mi&s;s Williams, who, on pretence of ordering tea, re|tired at my approach.&mdash;This favourable accident, which alarmed my whole &s;oul, di&s;ordered her al&s;o.&mdash;I found my&s;elf actuated by an irre&s;i&s;tible

impul&s;e, I advanced to her with eagerne&s;s and awe; and profiting by the confu&s;ion that pre|vailed over her, cla&s;ped the fair angel in my arms, and imprinted a glowing ki&s;s upon her lips, more &s;oft and fragrant than the dewy ro&s;e|bud ju&s;t bur&s;ting from the &s;tem!

<P>The evening being pretty far advanced, I forced my&s;elf from the dear object of my flame, who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting; and repairing to my lodgings, communicated to my friend Strap every circum&s;tance of my hap|pine&s;s, which filled him with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that it run over at his eyes; and he prayed hearti|ly, that no envious devil might, as formerly, da&s;h the cup of ble&s;&s;ing from my lip.&mdash;When I re|flected on what had happened, and e&s;pecially on the unre&s;erved prote&s;tations of Narci&s;&s;a's love, I could not help being amazed at her omitting to enquire into the particular circum&s;tances of the life and fortune of one whom &s;he had favoured with her affection, and I began to be a little an|xious about the &s;ituation of her finances; well knowing that I &s;hould do an irreparable injury to the per&s;on my &s;oul held mo&s;t dear, if I &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e her, without being enabled to &s;upport her in the rank which was certainly her due.&mdash;I had heard indeed, while I &s;erved her aunt, that her father had left her a con&s;iderable &s;um; and that every body believed &s;he would inherit the greate&s;t part of her kin&s;woman's dowry, but I did not know how far &s;he might be re&s;tricted by the old gentleman's will, in the enjoyment of what he left her; and I was too well informed of the virtuo&s;i's late conduct, to think my mi&s;tre&s;s could
<PB N="235" REF="249">
have any expectations from that quarter.&mdash;I con|fided, however, in the good &s;en&s;e and delicacy of my charmer, who, I was &s;ure, would not con&s;ent to unite her fate with mine, before &s;he had fully con&s;idered and provided for the con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>The Ball-night being arrived, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a &s;uit I had re&s;erved for &s;ome grand occa&s;ion; and having drank tea with Narci&s;&s;a and her bro|ther, conducted my angel to the &s;cene, where &s;he in a moment eclip&s;ed all her female compe|titors for beauty, and attracted the admiration of the whole a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;My heart dilated with pride on this occa&s;ion, and my triumph rejected all bounds, when, after we had danced together, a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure and influence in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> came up, and in the hearing of all pre&s;ent, honoured us with a very particular compliment, upon our accom|pli&s;hments and appearance;&mdash;but this tran&s;port was &s;oon checked, when I perceived his lord&s;hip attach him&s;elf with great a&s;&s;iduity to my mi&s;tre&s;s; and &s;ay &s;ome warm things, which I thought, &s;a|voured too much of pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It was then I be|gan to feel the pangs of jealou&s;y&mdash;I dreaded the power and addre&s;s of my rival&mdash;I &s;ickened at his di&s;cour&s;e; when &s;he opened her lips to an|&s;wer, my heart died within me&mdash;when &s;he &s;miled, I felt the pains of the damned!&mdash;I was enraged at his pre&s;umption; I cur&s;ed her com|plai&s;ance! when he quitted her and went to the other &s;ide of the room.&mdash;Narci&s;&s;a &s;u&s;pecting no|thing of the rage that inflamed me, put &s;ome que&s;tions to me, as &s;oon as he was gone, to which I made no other reply than a grim look, which too well denoted the agitation of my brea&s;t,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING uttered this exclamation, at which &s;he &s;ighed, I went home in the condition
<PB N="239" REF="253">
of a frantic Bedlamite; and finding the fire in my apartment almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, vented my fury upon poor Strap, who&s;e ear I pinched with &s;uch violence, that he roared hideou&s;ly with pain, and when I quitted my hold looked &s;o fooli&s;hly agha&s;t, that no unconcerned &s;pectator could have &s;een him, without been &s;eized with an immode|rate fit of laughter.&mdash;It it true, I was &s;oon &s;en|&s;ible of the injury I had done, and a&s;ked pardon for the outrage I had committed; upon which my faithful valet, &s;haking his head, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I forgive you, and may God forgive you."&mdash;</Q>But he could not help &s;hedding &s;ome tears at my unkind|ne&s;s. I felt un&s;peakable remor&s;e for what I had done, cur&s;ed my own ingratitude, and con&s;idered his tears as a reproach that my &s;oul, in her pre|&s;ent di&s;turbance, could not bear.&mdash;It &s;et all my pa&s;&s;ions into a new ferment, I &s;wore horrible oaths without meaning or application, I foamed at the mouth, kicked the chairs about the room, and play'd abundance of mad pranks that frightened my friend almo&s;t out of his &s;en&s;es.&mdash;At length my tran&s;port &s;ub&s;ided, I became melancholy, and wept in&s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of dejection, I was &s;urprized with the appearance of Mi&s;s Williams, whom Strap, blubbering all the while, had conducted in|to the chamber without giving me previous no|tice of her approach:&mdash;She was extremely af|fected with my condition, which &s;he had learned from him, begged me to moderate my pa&s;&s;ion, &s;u&s;pend my conjectures, and follow her to Narci&s;&s;a, who de&s;ired to &s;ee me forthwith.&mdash;That dear name operated upon me like a charm! I &s;tarted up, and without opening my lips, was conducted into her apartment through the garden, which
<PB N="240" REF="254">
we entered by a private door.&mdash;I found the ado|rable creature in tears! I was melted at the fight&mdash;we continued &s;ilent for &s;ome time&mdash;my heart was too full to &s;peak&mdash;her &s;nowy bo&s;om heaved with fond re&s;entment; at la&s;t &s;he &s;obbing cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What have I done to di&s;oblige you?"&mdash;</Q>My heart was pierced with the tender que&s;tion! I drew near with the utmo&s;t reverence of affection! I fell upon my knees before her, and ki&s;&s;ing her hand, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O! thou art all goodne&s;s and per|fection! I am undone by my want of merit! I am unworthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s thy charms, which heaven hath de&s;tined for the arms of &s;ome more favoured being."&mdash;</Q>She gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of my di&s;quiet, upbraided me gently for my &s;u&s;pi|cion, and gave me &s;uch flattering a&s;&s;urances of her eternal fidelity, that all my doubts and fears for&s;ook me, and peace and &s;atisfaction reigned within my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>At midnight I left the kind nymph to her re|po&s;e, and being let out by Mi&s;s Williams, at the garden gate by which I entered, began to ex|plore my way homeward in the dark, when I heard at my back a noi&s;e like that of a baboon when he mows and chatters. I turned in&s;tantly, and perceiving &s;omething black, concluded I was di&s;covered by &s;ome &s;py, employed to watch for that purpo&s;e: Arrou&s;ed at this conjecture, by which the reputation of the vir|tuous Narci&s;&s;a appeared in jeopardy, I drew my &s;word, and would have &s;acrificed him to her &s;ame, had not the voice of Strap re&s;trained my arm: It was with great difficulty he could pronounce, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"D&mdash;d&mdash;d&mdash;do! mum&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;murder me, if you plea&s;e!"</Q> Such an effect had the cold upon his jaws, that his teeth rattled like a

pair of ca&s;tanets&mdash;Plea&s;ed to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his con&s;ternation, and a&s;ked what brought him thither? Upon which he gave me to under&s;tand, that his concern for me had in|duced him to dodge me to that place, where the &s;ame rea&s;on had detained him till now; and he frankly owned, that in &s;pite of the e&s;teem he had for Mi&s;s Williams, he began to be very un|ea&s;y about me, con&s;idering the di&s;po&s;ition in which I went abroad; and if I had &s;taid much longer, would have certainly alarmed the neigh|bourhood in my behalf.&mdash;The knowledge of this his intention confounded me! I repre&s;ented to him the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences that would have at|tended &s;uch a ra&s;h action, and cautioning him &s;everely again&s;t any &s;uch de&s;ign for the future, concluded my admonition with an a&s;&s;urance, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould ever act &s;o madly, I would, without he&s;itation put him to death.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Have a little patience (cried he, in a lamentable tone) your di&s;plea&s;ure will do the bu&s;ine&s;s, with|out your committing murder."&mdash;</Q>I was touched with this reproach; and as &s;oon as we got home, made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to appea&s;e him, by explaining the cau&s;e of that tran&s;port, during which I had u&s;ed him &s;o unworthily.</P>
<P>Next day when I went into the long room, I ob&s;erved &s;everal whi&s;pers circulate all of a &s;udden; and did not doubt that Melinda had been bu&s;y with my character; but I con&s;oled my&s;elf with the love of Narci&s;&s;a, upon which I re&s;ted with the mo&s;t perfect confidence, and going up to the rowly-powly table, won a few pieces from my &s;u&s;pected rival, who with an ea&s;y politene&s;s, entered into conver&s;ation with me, and de&s;iring my company to the coffee-hou&s;e, treated me with
<PB N="242" REF="256">
tea and chocolate.&mdash;I remembred Strutwell, and guarded again&s;t his in&s;inuating behaviour; nor was my &s;u&s;picion wrong placed; he artfully turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon Narci&s;&s;a, and endeavoured, by hinting at an intrigue he pretended to be engaged in el&s;ewhere, to learn what connexion there was between her and me.&mdash;But all his fine&s;&s;e was in|effectual; I was convinced of his di&s;&s;imulation, and gave &s;uch general an&s;wers to his inquiries, that he was forced to drop the &s;ubject and talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>While we conver&s;ed in this manner, the &s;avage came in, with another gentleman, who intro|duced him to his lord&s;hip; and he was received with &s;uch peculiar marks of di&s;tinction, that I was per&s;uaded the courtier intended to u&s;e him in &s;ome &s;hape or another; and thence I con|ceived an unlucky omen.&mdash;But I had more cau&s;e to be di&s;mayed the following day, when I &s;aw the Squire in company with Melinda and her mo|ther, who honoured me with &s;everal di&s;dainful glances; and when I afterwards threw my&s;elf in his way, in&s;tead of the cordial &s;hake of the hand, returned my &s;alute with a cold repetition of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Servant, &s;ervant,"</Q> which he pronounced with &s;uch indifference, or rather contempt, that if he had not been Narci&s;&s;a's brother I &s;hould have affronted him in publick.</P>
<P>The&s;e occurrences di&s;turbed me not a little, I fore&s;aw the brooding &s;torm, and armed my&s;elf with re&s;olution for the occa&s;ion; but Narci&s;&s;a be|ing at &s;take, I was far from being re&s;igned.&mdash;I could have renounced every other comfort of life with &s;ome degree of fortitude; but the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing her, di&s;abled all my philo&s;ophy, and tortured my &s;oul into madne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="257">
Mi&s;s Williams found me, next morning, full of anxious tumult, which did not abate, when &s;he told me, that my Lord Quiverwit, having profe&s;&s;ed honourable intentions, had been intro|duced to my lovely Mi&s;tre&s;s by her brother, who had at the &s;ame time, from the information of Melinda, &s;poke of me as an Iri&s;h fortune-hunter, without either birth or e&s;tate to recommend me; who &s;upported my&s;elf in the appearance of a gentleman by &s;harping, and other infamous prac|tices; and who was of &s;uch an ob&s;cure origin, that I did not even know my own extraction.&mdash;Though I expected all this, I could not hear it with temper, e&s;pecially as truth was &s;o blended with fal&s;hood in the a&s;&s;ertion, that it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the one from the o|ther in my vindication.&mdash;But I &s;aid nothing on this head, being impatient to know how Narci&s;&s;a had been affected with the di&s;covery.&mdash;That ge|nerous creature, far from believing the&s;e impu|tations, was no &s;ooner withdrawn with her con|fidante, than &s;he inveighed with great warmth again&s;t the malevolence of the world, to which only &s;he a&s;cribed the whole of what had been &s;aid to my di&s;advantage; and calling every cir|cum&s;tance of my behaviour to her, into review before her, found every thing &s;o polite, honour|able and di&s;intere&s;ted, that &s;he could not harbour the lea&s;t doubt of my being the gentleman I ap|peared to be.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have indeed (&s;aid &s;he) pur|po&s;ely forbore to a&s;k the particulars of his life, le&s;t the recapitulation of &s;ome misfortunes, which he has undergone, &s;hould give him pain: And as to the article of his fortune, I own my&s;elf equally afraid of inquiring into it, and

<P>WHILE I entertained my&s;elf with the&s;e reflections, the news of this duel being communicated by &s;ome unknown channel, &s;pread all over the town.&mdash;I was vi&s;ited by Freeman, who te&s;tified his &s;urprize at finding me, having been told, that Lord Quiverwit being dead of his wounds, I had ab&s;conded, in order to avoid the cognizance of the law. I a&s;ked if people gue&s;&s;ed the occa&s;ion of the quarrel; and under|&s;tanding it was attributed to his lord&s;hip's re|&s;entment of my reply in the Long-room, con|firmed that conjecture, glad to find Narci&s;&s;a un|&s;u&s;pected.&mdash;My friend, after I had a&s;&s;ured him that my antagoni&s;t was in no danger, wi&s;hed me joy of the event, than which, he &s;aid, nothing could happen more opportunely to &s;upport the idea he had given of my character, to his friends,
<PB N="256" REF="270">
among whom he had been very a&s;&s;iduous in my behalf.</P>
<P>On the &s;trength of this a&s;&s;urance, I went with him to the coffee-hou&s;e, where I was &s;aluted by a great many of tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who &s;hun|ned me the preceeding day.&mdash;And I found every body making merry with the &s;tory of Melinda's French gallant.&mdash;While I remained in this place, I received a me&s;&s;age from Lord Quiverwit, de|&s;iring, if I was not engaged, to &s;ee me at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thither I immediately repaired, and was con|ducted to an apartment where I was received by his lord&s;hip in bed.&mdash;Being le&s;t by our&s;elves, he thanked me in very polite terms, for having u&s;ed the advantage fortune had given me over him, with &s;uch moderation; and a&s;ked pardon for any offence his re&s;entment might have prompted him to commit.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would willingly, (&s;aid he) make you my friend; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to dive&s;t my&s;elf of my pa&s;&s;ion for Narci&s;&s;a, I am too well convinced of your &s;entiments, to think we &s;hall ever agree on that &s;ubject. I took the liberty, therefore, of &s;ending for you, in order to own candidly, that I cannot help oppo&s;ing your &s;ucce&s;s with that young lady; though at the &s;ame time, I promi&s;e to regulate my op|po&s;ition by the dictates of ju&s;tice and honour: This, however, I think proper to adverti&s;e you of, that &s;he has no independant fortune, and if you &s;hould even &s;ucceed in your addre&s;&s;es, you would have the mortification to &s;ee her re|duced to indigence, unle&s;s you have where|withal to &s;upport her&mdash;And I am credibly in|formed of your incapacity that way.&mdash;Nay,
<PB N="257" REF="271">
I will confe&s;s, that, urged by this con&s;ideration, I have actually &s;ent notice to her brother, of the progre&s;s I &s;u&s;pect you have made in her affection, and de&s;ired him to take his pre|cautions accordingly."&mdash;</Q>Alarmed and pro|voked at this information, I told his lord&s;hip, that I did not &s;ee how he could reconcile that piece of conduct with his profe&s;&s;ion of open dealing, and flung away from him in a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I walked homeward, in hopes of hearing from my mi&s;tre&s;s as u&s;ual by means of Mi&s;s Williams, I was &s;urprized with the waving of a handkerchief, from the window of a coach and &s;ix that pa&s;&s;ed by me at full &s;peed; and upon further ob&s;ervation, I &s;aw a &s;ervant on hor&s;e-back riding after it, who, I knew by his livery, be|longed to the Squire.&mdash;Thunder&s;truck with this di&s;covery, the knowledge of my misfortune ru&s;hed all at once upon my reflection! I gue&s;&s;ed immediately that the &s;ignal was made by the dear hand of Narci&s;&s;a, who being hurried away in con&s;equence of Lord Quiverwit's me&s;&s;age to her brother, had no other method of relating her di&s;tre&s;s, and imploring my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Frantick with this conjecture, I run to my lodging, &s;natched my pi&s;tols, and ordered Strap to get po&s;t-hor&s;es, with &s;uch incoherence of &s;peech and di&s;order, that the poor valet, terrified with the &s;u&s;picion of another duel, in&s;tead of providing what I de&s;ired, went forthwith to Freeman, who being informed of my be|haviour, came &s;treight to my apartment, and conjured me &s;o pathetically to acquaint him with the cau&s;e of my unea&s;ine&s;s, that I could not refu&s;e to tell him my happine&s;s was fled with Narci&s;&s;a, and that I mu&s;t retrieve

her or peri&s;h. He repre&s;ented the madne&s;s of &s;uch an undertaking, and endeavoured to divert me from it with great &s;trength of friend&s;hip and rea&s;on: But all his arguments would have been ineffectual, had he not put me in mind of the dependance I ought to have on the love of Nar|ci&s;&s;a, and attachment of her maid, which could not fail of finding opportunities enow to adver|ti&s;e me of their &s;ituation; and at the &s;ame time, demon&s;trated the injury my charmer's reputation mu&s;t &s;uffer from my precipitate retreat. I was convinced and compo&s;ed by the&s;e con&s;iderations: I appeared in publick with an air of tranquility, was well received by the be&s;t company in town, and my misfortune taking air, condoled accord|ingly; while I had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing Melinda &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;countenanced, that &s;he was fain to return to London, in order to avoid the &s;coffs and cen&s;ure of the ladies at Bath.&mdash;But though the hope of hearing from the darling of my &s;oul &s;upported my &s;pirits a little while, I began to be very unea&s;y, when at the end of &s;everal weeks, I found that expectation di&s;ap|pointed.&mdash;In &s;hort, melancholy and de&s;pondence took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul; and repining at that providence, which by acting the &s;tepmother to|wards me, kept me from the fruition of my wi&s;hes, I determined, in a fit of de&s;pair, to ri&s;k all I had at the gaming table, with a view of acquiring a fortune &s;ufficient to render me inde|pendant for life; or of plunging my&s;elf into &s;uch a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, as would effectually cru&s;h every ambitious hope that now tortured my imagination.</P>
<P>Actuated by this fatal re&s;olution, I engaged in play, and after &s;ome turns of fortune, found my|&s;elf,
<PB N="259" REF="273">
at the end of three days, worth a thou&s;and pounds; but it was not my intention to &s;top there, for which cau&s;e I kept Strap ignorant of my &s;ucce&s;s, and continued my career, until I was reduced to five guineas, which I would have hazarded al&s;o, had I not been a&s;hamed to fall from a bett of two hundred pounds to &s;uch a petty &s;um.</P>
<P>Having thus executed my &s;cheme, I went home, amazed to find my&s;elf &s;o much at ea&s;e, and informed my friend Strap of my mi&s;chance, with &s;uch calmne&s;s, that he imagining I joked, affected to receive the tidings with great equani|mity.&mdash;But both he and I found our&s;elves mi&s;taken very &s;oon.&mdash;I had mi&s;interpreted my own &s;tupidity into deliberate re&s;ignation, and he had rea&s;on to believe me in earne&s;t, when he &s;aw me next morning agitated with the mo&s;t violent de&s;pair, which he endeavoured to alleviate with all the con&s;olation in his power.</P>
<P>In one of my lucid intervals, however, I charged him to take a place in the &s;tage coach for London; and in the mean time, pay'd my debts in Bath, which amounted to thirty &s;hillings only.&mdash;Without taking leave of my friends I embarked, Strap having the good fortune to find a return hor&s;e, and arrived in town, without having met with any thing remarkable on the road; &s;ave that, while we cro&s;&s;ed Bag&s;hot Heath, I was &s;eized with a &s;ort of inclination to retrieve my fortune, by laying pa&s;&s;engers under contribu|tion, in &s;ome &s;uch place.&mdash;My thoughts were &s;o circum&s;tanced at this time, that I &s;hould have dige&s;ted the crime of robbery, &s;o righteou&s;ly had I concerted my plan, and ventured my life in the

execution, had I not been deterred by reflecting upon the infamy that attends detection.</P>
<P>The apartment I formerly lived in being un|engaged, I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and next day went in que&s;t of Banter, who received me with open arms, in expectation of having his bond di&s;|charged to his liking: But when he under&s;tood what had happened, his countenance changed of a &s;udden; and he told me, with a dryne&s;s of di&s;plea&s;ure peculiar to him&s;elf, that if he was in my place, he would put it out of fortune's power to play him &s;uch another trick, and be avenged of his own indi&s;cretion at once.&mdash;When I de&s;ired him to explain his meaning, he pointed to his neck, rai&s;ed him&s;elf on his tip-toes, and was going away without any further ceremony, when I put him in mind of my indigence, and de|manded the five guineas I had formerly lent him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Five guineas! (cried he) Zounds! had you acted with common prudence you might have had twenty thou&s;and in your pocket by this time.&mdash;I depended upon five hundred from you, as much as if I had had notes for it in the bank; and by all the rules of equity, you are indebted to me for that &s;um."&mdash;</Q>I was nei|ther plea&s;ed nor convinced by this computation, and in&s;i&s;ted on my right with &s;uch determined ob&s;tinacy, that he was fain to alter his tone, and appea&s;e my clamour, by a&s;&s;uring me, that he was not ma&s;ter of five &s;hillings.&mdash;Society in di&s;tre&s;s, generally promotes good under&s;tanding among people; from being a dun, I de&s;cended to be a client, and a&s;ked his advice about repair|ing my lo&s;&s;es.&mdash;He coun&s;elled me to have recour&s;e again to the gaming table, where I had &s;ucceeded

<P>I returned to my lodgings full of de&s;perate re|&s;olution, and having made Strap acquainted with my fate, ordered him to pawn my &s;word im|mediately, that I might be enabled to make a|nother effort.&mdash;This affectionate creature no &s;ooner under&s;tood my purpo&s;e, than &s;eized with in&s;uppre&s;&s;ible &s;orrow at the pro&s;pect of my mi|&s;ery, he bur&s;t into tears, and a&s;ked what I pro|po&s;ed to do after the &s;mall &s;um he could rai&s;e on the &s;word &s;hould be &s;pent: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On my own ac|count (&s;aid he) I am quite unconcerned; for while God &s;pares me health and the&s;e ten fingers, I can earn a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence any where; but what mu&s;t become of you, who have le&s;s humility to &s;toop, and more appetites to grati|fy."&mdash;</Q>Here I interrupted him, by &s;aying, with a gloomy a&s;pect, I could never want a re&s;ource while I had a loaded pi&s;tol in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Stupified with horror, at this dreadful in&s;inuation, he &s;tood mute for &s;ome time, and then broke out into <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God of his infinite mercy enable you to with|&s;tand that temptation of the devil!&mdash;con&s;ider your immortal &s;oul&mdash;there's no repentance in the grave!&mdash;O Lord! that ever it &s;hould come to this&mdash;Are we not enjoined to re&s;ign our&s;elves to the will of heaven?&mdash;where is your patience?&mdash;<HI>Durum patientia frango</HI>&mdash;you are but a young man&mdash;there may be many good things in &s;tore for you&mdash;<HI>accidit in puncto, quid non &s;peratur in anno</HI>&mdash;remember your

<P>This kind letter afforded me great con&s;ola|tion: I communicated it to Banter, and at the &s;ame time, &s;hewed him her picture: He ap|proved her beauty and good &s;en&s;e, and could not help owning, that my neglect of Mi&s;s Snap|per was excu&s;able, when &s;uch a fine creature engro&s;&s;ed my attention.</P>
<P>I began to be reconciled to my fate, and ima|gined, that if I could contrive means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing until my uncle &s;hould arrive, in ca&s;e he was not already at home, that he would enable me to do &s;omething effectual in behalf of my love and fortune&mdash;I therefore con&s;ulted Banter about a pre&s;ent &s;upply, who no &s;ooner under|&s;tood that I had credit with a taylor, than he advi&s;ed me to take off two or three &s;uits of

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I am arre&s;ted&mdash;carried to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea&mdash;find my old acquaintance beau Jack&s;on in that jail&mdash;he informs me of his adventures&mdash;Strap arrives, and with difficulty is com|forted&mdash;Jack&s;on introduces me to a poet&mdash;I admire his conver&s;ation and capacity&mdash;am deeply affected with my misfortune&mdash;Strap hires him&s;elf as a journeyman-barber.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT this expedient was in a few weeks at|tended with a con&s;equence I did not fore&s;ee: a player having purcha&s;ed one of the &s;uits which were expo&s;ed to &s;ale, appeared in it on the &s;tage one night, while my taylor unfortunately happen|ed to be pre&s;ent.&mdash;He knew it immediately, and enquiring minutely into the affair, di&s;covered my whole contrivance: upon which he came to my lodgings, and telling me that he was very much &s;traitened for want of money, pre&s;ented his bill, which amounted to 50<HI>l.</HI>&mdash;Surprized at this un|expected addre&s;s, I affected to treat him cava|lierly, &s;wore &s;ome oaths, a&s;ked if he doubted my honour, and, telling him I &s;hould take care who I dealt with for the future, bid him come again in three days.&mdash;He obeyed me punctually, de|manded his money, and finding him&s;elf amu&s;ed with bare promi&s;es, arre&s;ted me that very day in the &s;treet.&mdash;I was not much &s;hocked at this ad|venture, which, indeed, re&s;cued me from a hor|rible
<PB N="266" REF="280">
&s;u&s;pence in which I had lived &s;ince his fir&s;t vi&s;it. I refu&s;ed to go to a &s;punging-hou&s;e, where I had heard there was nothing but the mo&s;t fla|grant impo&s;ition; and a coach being called, I was carried to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, attended by a bailiff and his follower, who were very much di&s;appointed and chagrined at my re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The turnkey gue&s;&s;ing, from my appearance, that I had got money in my pocket, received me with the repetition of the Latin word <HI>depone,</HI> and gave me to under&s;tand, that I mu&s;t pay be|fore-hand for the apartment I &s;hould chu&s;e to dwell in.&mdash;&s; de&s;ired to &s;ee his conveniencies, and hired a &s;mall, paultry bed-chamber, for a crown a week, which, in any other place, would not have let at eighteen-pence.&mdash;Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this di&s;mal habitation, I &s;ent for Strap, and my thoughts were bu&s;ied in collecting matter of con&s;olation to that faithful &s;quire, when &s;omebody knocked at my door, which I no &s;ooner opened, than a young fellow entered, in very &s;habby cloaths and marvellous foul linnen. After a low bow, he called me by my name, and a&s;ked if I had forgot him. His voice a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in recollecting this per&s;on, whom I &s;oon re|cognized to be my old acquaintance beau Jack&s;on, of whom mention is made in the fir&s;t part of my memoirs.&mdash;I &s;aluted him, expre&s;&s;ed my &s;a|tisfaction at finding him alive, and condoled with him on his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; which, how|ever, did not &s;eem to affect him much, for he laughed very heartily at the occa&s;ion of our meet|ing &s;o unexpectedly in this place. After our mutual compliments were over, I enquired about his amour with the lady of fortune, which &s;eem'd to be &s;o near an happy conclu&s;ion when I had the
<PB N="267" REF="281">
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him la&s;t: and after an immode|rate fit of laughter, he gave me to under&s;tand, that he had been egregiou&s;ly bit in that affair.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mu&s;t know, (&s;aid &s;he) that a few days after our adventure with the bawd and her b&mdash;ches, I found means to be married to that &s;ame fine lady you &s;peak of, and pa&s;&s;ed the night with her at her lodgings, &s;o much to her &s;atisfaction, that early in the morning, after a good deal of &s;niveling and &s;obbing, &s;he owned, that &s;o far from being an heire&s;s of a great fortune, &s;he was no other than a com|mon woman of the town, who had decoyed me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the pri|vilege of a &s;emme couverte; and that, unle&s;s I made my e&s;cape immediately, I &s;hould be arre&s;ted for a debt of her contracting, by bai|liffs employed and in&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;Startled at this intimation, I got up in a twinkling, and taking leave of my &s;pou&s;e with &s;everal hearty damns, got &s;afe into the verge of the court; where I kept &s;nug, until I was appointed &s;urgeon's mate of a man of war at Port&s;mouth; for which place I &s;et out on a Sunday, went on board of my &s;hip, in which I &s;ailed to the Straits, where I had the good fortune to be made &s;urgeon of a &s;loop that came home in a few months after, and was put out of commi&s;&s;ion: whereupon I came to London, imagining my&s;elf forgotten and freed from my wife and her creditors; but had not been in town a week before I was arre&s;ted for a debt her's, amounting to 20<HI>l.</HI> and brought to this place, where I have been fixed by another action &s;ince that time.&mdash;However, you know my di&s;po&s;ition; I defy care and
<PB N="268" REF="282">
anxiety; and being on the half-pay li&s;t, make &s;hift to live here tolerably ea&s;y."&mdash;</Q>I congra|tulated him on his philo&s;ophy, and remembring that I was in his debt, repay'd the money he formerly lent me, which, I believe, was far from being un&s;ea&s;onable. I then enquired about the oeconomy of the place, which he explained to my &s;atisfaction; and after we had agreed to me&s;s together, he was ju&s;t going to give orders for dinner when Strap arrived.</P>
<P>I never in my life &s;aw &s;orrow &s;o extravagantly expre&s;&s;ed in any countenance, as in that of my hone&s;t friend, which was, indeed, particularly adapted by nature for &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Being left by our&s;elves, I communicated to him my di&s;a&s;ter, and endeavoured to con&s;ole him with the &s;ame arguments he had formerly u&s;ed to me, withal repre&s;enting the fair chance I had of being relieved, in a &s;hort time, by Mr. Bowling.&mdash;But his grief was unutterable; he &s;eemed to give attention without li&s;tening, and wrung his hands in &s;ilence; &s;o that I was in a fair way of being infected with his behaviour, when Jack&s;on returned, and perceiving the de|ference I payed to Strap, altho' in a footman's habit, di&s;tributed his crumbs of comfort with &s;uch mirth, jollity and unconcern, that the fea|tures of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;quire relaxed by degrees, he recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech, and begun to be a little more reconciled to this lamentable event.&mdash;We dined together on beiled beef and greens, brought from a cook's &s;hop in the neighbour|hood: and altho' this meal was &s;erved up in a manner little corre&s;ponding with the &s;phere of life in which I had lately lived, I made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, eat with good appetite, and treated
<PB N="269" REF="283">
my friends with a bottle of wine, which had the de&s;ired effect, of increa&s;ing the good humour of my fellow-pri&s;oner, and exhilarating the &s;pirits of Strap, who now talked of my misfortune <HI>en Cavalier.</HI></P>
<P>After dinner Jack&s;on le&s;t us to our private af|fairs; when I de&s;ired my friend to pack up all our things, and carry them to &s;ome cheap lodg|ing he &s;hould chu&s;e for him&s;elf in the neighbour|hood of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, after he had di&s;charged my lodging, for which I gave him money.&mdash;I likewi&s;e recommended to him the keeping my misfortune &s;ecret, and &s;aying to my landlord, or any other who &s;hould enquire for me, that I was gone into the country for a few weeks: at the &s;ame time I laid &s;trong injunctions upon him to call every &s;econd day upon Banter, in ca&s;e he &s;hould receive any letters for me from Narci&s;&s;a, by the canal of Freeman; and by all means to leave a direction for him&s;elf, at my uncle's lodg|ings in Wapping, by which I might be found when my kin&s;man &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>When he departed to execute the&s;e orders, (which, by the bye, were punctually perform'd that very night) I found my&s;elf &s;o little &s;ea&s;oned to my &s;ituation, that I dreaded reflection, and &s;ought &s;helter from it in the company of the beau, who, promi&s;ing to regale me with a lecture upon ta&s;te, conducted me to the common &s;ide, where I &s;aw a number of naked mi&s;erable wretches a&s;&s;embled together.&mdash;We had not been here many minutes, when a figure appeared, wrapp'd in a dirty rug, tied about his loins with two pieces of li&s;t, of different colours, knotted together; having a black bu&s;hy beard, and his head co|vered with a huge ma&s;s of brown periwig, which
<PB N="270" REF="284">
&s;eemed to have been ravi&s;hed from the crown of &s;ome &s;care crow.&mdash;This apparition, &s;talking in with great &s;olemnity, made a profound bow to the audience, who &s;ignified their approbation by a general re&s;pon&s;e of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How d'ye do, doctor?"</Q> He then turned towards us, and honoured Jack|&s;on with a particular &s;alutation: upon which my friend, in a formal manner, introduced him to me, by the name of Mr. Melopoyn.&mdash;This ce|remony being over, he advanced into the middle of the congregation, which crowded around him, and hemming three times, to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment, pronounced with great &s;ignificance of voice and ge&s;ture, a very elegant and ingenious di&s;|cour&s;e upon the difference between genius and ta&s;te, illu&s;trating his a&s;&s;ertions with apt quotations from the be&s;t authors, ancient as well as modern. When he had fini&s;hed his harangue, which la&s;ted a full hour, he bowed again to the &s;pectators; not one of whom (I was informed) under&s;tood &s;o much as a &s;entence of what he uttered. They manife&s;ted, however, their admiration and e&s;teem by voluntary contribution, which, Jack&s;on told me, one week with another, amounted to eigh|teen pence.&mdash;This moderate &s;tipend, together with &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents that he received for making up differences, and deciding cau&s;es a|mong&s;t the pri&s;oners, ju&s;t enabled him to breathe and walk about in the grote&s;que figure I have de&s;cribed.&mdash;I under&s;tood al&s;o, that he was an excellent poet, and had compo&s;ed a tragedy, which was allowed, by every body who had &s;een it, to be a performance of great merit; that his learning was infinite, his morals unexceptionable, and his mode&s;ty invincible.&mdash;Such a character could not fail of attracting my regard; I longed
<PB N="271" REF="285">
impatiently to be better acquainted with him, and de&s;ired Jack&s;on would engage him to &s;pend the evening in my apartment.&mdash;My reque&s;t was granted, he favoured us with his company, and in the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, perceiving that I was not illiterate, and that I had a &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ion for the Belle Lettres, acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well on that &s;ubject, that I expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ervent de&s;ire of &s;eeing his productions.&mdash;In this too be gratified my inclination:&mdash;he promi&s;ed to bring his tragedy to my room next day, and, in the mean time, entertained me with &s;ome detach'd pieces, which gave me a very advantageous idea of his poetical talent.&mdash;Among other things I was particularly plea&s;ed with &s;ome elegies, in imitation of Tibullus; one of which I beg leave to &s;ubmit to the reader, as a &s;pecimen of his com|plexion and capacity.<Q><LG TYPE="elegy">

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I read Melopogn's tragedy, and conceive a va&s;t opinion of his genius&mdash;he recounts his adventures.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE we eat our breakfa&s;t together, I acquainted him with the character and con|dition of the poet, who came in with his play at that in&s;tant, and imagining we were engaged about bu&s;ine&s;s, could not be prevailed upon to &s;it; but leaving his performance, went away.&mdash;My friend's tender heart was melted at the &s;ight of a gentleman and Chri&s;tian (for he had a great ve|neration for both the&s;e epithits) in &s;uch mi&s;ery; and a&s;&s;ented with great chearfulne&s;s to a propo&s;al I made of cloathing him with our &s;uperfluities; a ta&s;k with which he charged him&s;elf, and de|parted immediately to perform it.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner gone, than I locked my door and &s;at down to the tragedy, which I read to the end with va&s;t plea&s;ure, not a little amazed at the conduct of the managers who had rejected it.&mdash;The fable, in my opinion was well cho&s;en, and naturally conducted, the incidents intere&s;t|ing, the characters beautifully contra&s;ted, &s;trongly marked, and well &s;upported; the diction poeti|cal, &s;pirited and correct; the unities of the drama maintained with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s; the opening gradual and engaging; the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;urprizing, and the cata&s;trophe affecting: In

&s;hort, I judged it by the laws of Ari&s;totle and Horace, and could find nothing in it exceptionable, but a little too much embelli&s;hment in &s;ome few places, which objection he removed to my &s;atis|faction, by a quotation from Ari&s;totle's poetics, importing, that the lea&s;t intere&s;ting parts of a poem ought to be rai&s;ed and dignified by the charms and energy of diction.</P>
<P>I revered his genius, and was &s;eized with an eager curio&s;ity to know the particular events of a fortune &s;o unworthy of his merit.&mdash;At that in|&s;tant Strap returned with a bundle of cloaths, which I &s;ent with my compliments to Mr. Me|lopoyn, as a &s;mall token of my regard, and de|&s;ired the favour of his company to dinner.&mdash;He accepted my pre&s;ent and invitation, and in le&s;s than half an hour made his appearance in a decent dre&s;s, which altered his figure very much to his advantage.&mdash;I perceived by his countenance, that his heart was big with gratitude, and endeavoured to prevent his acknowledgments, by a&s;king par|don for the liberty I had taken; he made no reply, but with an a&s;pect full of admiration and e&s;teem, bowed to the ground, while the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes.&mdash;Affected with the&s;e &s;ymp|toms of an ingenuous mind, I &s;hifted the conver|&s;ation from this &s;ubject, and complimented him on his performance, which I a&s;&s;ured him, afforded me infinite plea&s;ure.&mdash;My approbation made him happy; dinner being &s;erved, and Jack&s;on arrived, I begged their permi&s;&s;ion for Strap to &s;it at table with us, after having informed them, that he was a per&s;on to whom I was extremely obliged; they were kind enough to grant that &s;avour, and we eat together with great harmony and &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="290">
Our meal being ended, I expre&s;&s;ed my wonder at the little regard Mr. Melopoyn had met with from the world; and &s;ignified a de&s;ire of hearing how he had been treated by the managers of the play-hou&s;es, to whom, I under&s;tood from Jack|&s;on, he had offered his tragedy, without &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is &s;o little entertaining in the inci|dents of my life (&s;aid he) that I am &s;ure the recital will not recompence your attention; but &s;ince you di&s;cover an inclination to know them, I under&s;tand my duty too well to di&s;ap|point your de&s;ire.</Q></P>
<Q><P>MY father, who was a curate in the country, being by the narrowne&s;s of his circum|&s;tances, hindred from maintaining me at the uni|ver&s;ity, took the charge of my education upon him&s;elf, and laboured with &s;uch indu&s;try and concern in the undertaking, that I had little cau&s;e to regret the want of publick ma&s;ters.&mdash;Being at great pains to con&s;ult my natural bya&s;s, he di&s;covered in me betimes, an inclination for poetry; upon which he recommended to me an intimate acquaintance with the cla&s;&s;icks, in the cultivation of which, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with paternal zeal and uncommon erudition.&mdash;When he thought me &s;ufficiently acquainted with the an|cients, he directed my &s;tudies to the be&s;t modern authors, French and Italian as well as Engli&s;h, and laid a particular injunction upon me, to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of my mother tongue.</P>
<P>About the age of eighteen, I grew ambitious of undertaking a work of &s;ome con&s;equence; and with my father's approbation, actually plan|ned the tragedy you have read; but before I had fini&s;hed four acts, that indulgent parent died,
<PB N="277" REF="291">
and left my mother and me in very indigent circum&s;tances.&mdash;A near relation compa&s;&s;ionating our di&s;tre&s;s, took us into his family, where I brought my fable to a conclu&s;ion; and &s;oon after, my mother quitted this life.&mdash;When my &s;orrow for this melancholy event had &s;ub&s;ided, I told my kin&s;man, who was a farmer, that having paid my la&s;t duty to my parent, I had now no attachment to detain me in the country, and therefore was re&s;olved to &s;et out for London, and offer my play to the &s;tage, where I did not doubt of acquiring a large &s;hare of fame as well as fortune; in which ca&s;e I &s;hould not be unmind|ful of my friends and benefactors.&mdash;My cou&s;in was ravi&s;hed with the pro&s;pect of my felicity, and willingly contributed towards the expence of fit|ting me out for my expedition.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I took a place in the waggon, and arrived in town, where I hired an apart|ment in a garret, willing to live as frugally as po&s;&s;ible, until I &s;hould know what I had to ex|pect from the manager, to whom I intended to offer my play.&mdash;For though I looked upon my|&s;elf as perfectly &s;ecure of a good reception, ima|gining that a patentee would be as eager to re|ceive, as I to pre&s;ent my production; I did not know whether or not he might be pre-engaged in favour of another author, which would cer|tainly retard my &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;On this con&s;ideration too, I determined to be &s;peedy in my application, and even to wait upon one of the managers, the very next day. For this purpo&s;e, I enquired of my landlord, if he knew where either, or both of them lived; and he being curious to know my bu&s;ine&s;s, and at the &s;ame time, appearing to be a very hone&s;t friendly man (a tallow-chandler)
<PB N="278" REF="292">
I made him acquainted with my de&s;ign; upon which he told me, that I went the wrong way to work; that I would not find &s;uch ea&s;y acce&s;s to a manager as I imagined; and that if I delivered my per|formance without proper recommendation, it would be as one to a thou&s;and if ever it &s;hould be minded.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Take my advice (&s;aid he) and your bu&s;ine&s;s is done.&mdash;One of the patentees is a good catholick, as I am, and u&s;es the &s;ame father who confe&s;&s;es me.&mdash;I will make you acquainted with this good prie&s;t, who is an excellent &s;cholar, and if he &s;hall approve of your play, his recommendation will go a great way in determining Mr. Supple to bring it on the &s;tage."&mdash;</Q>I applauded his expedient, and was introduced to the friar, who having peru&s;ed the tragedy, was plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his approba|tion, and commended me in particular, for hav|ing avoided all reflections upon religion.&mdash;He promi&s;ed to u&s;e all his influence with his &s;on Supple, in my behalf, and to inform him&s;elf that very day, when it would be proper for me to wait upon him with the piece.&mdash;He was punctual in performing his engagement, and next morning gave me to under&s;tand, that he had mentioned my affair to the manager, and that I had no more to do, than to go to his hou&s;e any time in the forenoon, and make u&s;e of his name, upon which I would find immediate admittance.&mdash;I took his advice, put my performance in my bo&s;om, and having received directions, went im|mediately to the hou&s;e of Mr. Supple, and knocked at the door, that had a wicket in the middle, faced with a net-work of iron, through which a &s;ervant having viewed me &s;ome time, demanded to know my bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;I told him, my bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="279" REF="293">
was with Mr. Supple, and that I came from Mr. O Varni&s;h.&mdash;He examined my appearance once more, then went away, returned in a few mi|nutes, and &s;aid his ma&s;ter was bu&s;y and could not be &s;een.&mdash;Although I was a little mortified at my di&s;appointment, I was per&s;uaded that my reception was owing to Mr. Supple's ignorance of my errand; and that I might meet with no more ob&s;tructions of the &s;ame kind, I de&s;ired Mr. O Varni&s;h to be my introductor the next time.&mdash;He complied with my reque&s;t, and obtained immediate admittance to the ma|nager, who received me with the utmo&s;t civility, and promi&s;ed to read my play with the fir&s;t con|venience.&mdash;By his own appointment I called again in a fortnight, but he was gone out; I returned in a week after, and the poor gentleman was ex|tremely ill; I renewed my vi&s;it in a fortnight after that, and he a&s;&s;ured me, he had been &s;o much fatigued with bu&s;ine&s;s, that he had not been able as yet to read it to an end; but he would take the fir&s;t opportunity; and in the mean time, ob&s;erved, that what he had yet &s;een of it was very entertaining.&mdash;I comforted my&s;elf with this declaration a few weeks longer, at the end of which I appeared again before his wicket, was let in, and found him laid up with the gout. I no &s;ooner entered his chamber, than looking at me with a langui&s;hing eye, he pronounced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Melopoyn, I'm heartily &s;orry for an ac|cident that has happened during my illne&s;s&mdash;you mu&s;t know, that my elde&s;t boy, finding your manu&s;cript upon the table, in the dining|room, where I u&s;ed to read it, carried it into the kitchin, and leaving it there, a negligent wench of a cook maid, mi&s;taking it for wa&s;te|paper,
<PB N="280" REF="294">
has expended it all but a few leaves in &s;ingeing fouls upon the &s;pit&mdash;But I hope the misfortune is not irreparable, &s;ince, no doubt, you have &s;everal copies."</Q></P>
<P>I prote&s;t to you, my good friend Mr. Random, I was extremely &s;hocked at this information! but the good-natured gentleman &s;eemed to be &s;o much affected with my misfortune, that I &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed my concern, and told him, that altho' I had not another copy, I &s;hould be able to retrieve the lo&s;s by writing another from my memory, which was very tenacious. You cannot imagine how well plea&s;ed Mr. Supple was at this a&s;&s;urance; he begged I would &s;et about it immediately, and carefully re|volve and recollect every circum&s;tance, before I pretended to commit it to paper, that it might be the &s;ame individual play that he had peru&s;ed.&mdash;Encouraged by this injunction, which plainly demon&s;trated how much he intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the affair, I ta&s;ked my remembrance and indu&s;try, and in three weeks produced the exact image of the former, which was conveyed to him by my good friend, father O Varni&s;h, who let me know next day, that Mr. Supple would revi&s;e it &s;uper|ficially, in order to judge of its &s;amene&s;s with the other, and then give his final an&s;wer.&mdash;For this examination I allotted a week; and in full confidence of &s;eeing it acted in a little while, de|manded an audience of the manager, when that term was expired.&mdash;But alas! the &s;ea&s;on had &s;lipt away in&s;en&s;ibly; he convinced me, that if my play had been put into rehear&s;al at that time, it could not have been ready for performing, until the end of March, when the benefit nights come on; con&s;equently it would have interfered with
<PB N="281" REF="295">
the intere&s;t of the players, whom it was not my bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;oblige.</P>
<P>I was fain to acquie&s;ce in the&s;e rea&s;ons, which to be &s;ure were extremely ju&s;t; and to re&s;erve my performance to the next &s;ea&s;on, when he hoped I would not be &s;o unlucky.&mdash;Although it was a grievous di&s;appointment to me, who by this time, began to want both money and nece&s;|&s;aries; having, on the &s;trength of my expecta|tion from the theatre, launched out into &s;ome extravagancies, by which the &s;um I brought to town was already almo&s;t con&s;umed.&mdash;Indeed, I ought to be a&s;hamed at this circum&s;tance of my conduct: For my finances were &s;ufficient, with good oeconomy, to have maintained me comfor|tably a whole year.&mdash;You will perhaps be amazed when I tell you, that in &s;ix months, I expended not a farthing le&s;s than ten guineas: But when one con&s;iders the temptations to which a young man is expo&s;ed in this great city, e&s;pe|cially if he is addicted to plea&s;ure as I am, the wonder will vani&s;h, or at lea&s;t abate.&mdash;Nor was the cau&s;e of my concern limited to my own &s;i|tuation entirely: I had wrote an account of my good reception to my kin&s;man the farmer, and de|&s;ired him to depend upon me for the money he had kindly accommodated me with, about the end of February: which promi&s;e I now found my&s;elf unable to perform.&mdash;However, there was no remedy but patience: I applied to my land|lord, who was a very good-natured man, candid|ly owned my di&s;tre&s;s, and begged his advice in laying down &s;ome plan for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.&mdash;He readily promi&s;ed to con&s;ult his confe&s;&s;or on this &s;ubject, and in the mean time, told me, I was welcome to lodge and board with him, until for|tune
<PB N="282" REF="296">
&s;hould put it in my power to make re&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>Mr. O Varni&s;h being informed of my nece&s;|ty, offered to introduce me to the author of a weekly paper, who, he did not doubt, would em|ploy me in that way, provided he &s;hould find me duly qualified; but upon enquiry, I under&s;tood, that this journal was calculated to foment divi|&s;ions in the commonwealth, and therefore I de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from engaging in it.&mdash;He then propo&s;ed that I &s;hould write &s;omething in the poetical way, which I might di&s;po&s;e of to a book&s;eller for a pretty &s;um of ready money, and perhaps e&s;tabli&s;h my own character into the bar|gain; this event would infallibly procure friends; and my tragedy would appear next &s;ea&s;on to the be&s;t advantage, by being &s;upported both by in|tere&s;t and reputation.&mdash;I was charmed with this pro&s;pect, and having heard what friends Mr. Pope required by his pa&s;torals, &s;et about a work of that kind, and in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks, compo&s;ed as many ecclogues, which I forthwith offered to an eminent book&s;eller, who de&s;ired I would leave them for his peru&s;al, and he would give me an an&s;wer in two days.&mdash;At the end of that time, I went to him, when he returned the poems, tell|ing me, they would not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, and &s;weetned his refu&s;al, by &s;aying there were &s;ome good clever lines in them.&mdash;Not a little dejected at his rebuff, which, I learned from Mr. O Var|ni&s;h, was owing to the opinion of another author, whom this book&s;eller always con&s;ulted on the&s;e occa&s;ions, I applied to another per&s;on of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, who told me, that the town was cloyed with pa&s;torals, and advi&s;ed me, if I in|tended to profit by my talents, to write &s;omething
<PB N="283" REF="297">
&s;atirical or lu&s;cious, &s;uch as the <HI>Button Hole, Shocky and Towzer, the Leaky Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;and yet this was a man in years, who wore a reverend peri|wig, looked like a &s;enator, and went regularly to church.&mdash;Be that as it will, I &s;corned to pro&s;titute my pen in the manner he propo&s;ed, and carried my papers to a third, who a&s;&s;ured me, that poetry was intirely out of his way; and a&s;ked, if I had got never a piece of &s;ecret hi|&s;tory, thrown into a &s;eries of letters, or a volume of adventures, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, and Colonel Jack, or a collection of conundrums, wherewith to entertain the plantations.&mdash;Being quite unfurni&s;hed for this dealer, I had recour&s;e to another with as little &s;ucce&s;s, and I verily be|lieve was rejected by the whole trade.</P>
<P>I was afterwards per&s;uaded to offer my&s;elf as a tran&s;lator, and accordingly repaired to a per&s;on, who was &s;aid to entertain numbers of that cla&s;s in his pay; he a&s;&s;ured me, he had already a great deal of that work on his hands, which he did not know what to do with; ob&s;erved that tran&s;lation was a meer drug, that branch of li|terature being over&s;tocked by an inundation of au|thors from North-Britain; and a&s;ked what I would expect per &s;heet, for rendering the Latin cla&s;&s;icks into Engli&s;h.&mdash;That I might not make my&s;elf too cheap, I determined to &s;et a high price upon my qualifications, and demanded a guinea for every tran&s;lated &s;heet.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A guinea!</Q> (cried he, &s;taring at me) then pau&s;ed a little, and &s;aid, he had no occa&s;ion for my &s;ervice at pre&s;ent.&mdash;I found my error, and re&s;olving to make amends, fell one half in my demand; upon which he &s;tared at me again, and told me his hands were
<PB N="284" REF="298">
full.&mdash;I attempted others, without finding em|ployment, and was actually reduced to a very un|comfortable pro&s;pect, when I bethought my&s;elf of offering my talents to the printers of half|penny ballads, and other &s;uch occa&s;ional e&s;&s;ays as are hawked about the &s;treets.&mdash;With this view, I applied to one of the mo&s;t noted and vocife|rous of this tribe, who directed me to a per&s;on whom I found entertaining a whole crowd of them with gin, bread and chee&s;e; he carried me into a little back parlour, very neatly furni&s;hed, where I &s;ignified my de&s;ire of being enrolled a|mong his writers; and was a&s;ked, what kind of compo&s;ition I profe&s;&s;ed?&mdash;Under&s;tanding that my inclination leaned towards poetry, he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, telling me, one of his poets had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and was confined in Bedlam, and the other was become dozed with drinking drams; &s;o that he had not done any thing tolerable the&s;e many weeks.&mdash;When I propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould enter into terms of agreement, he gave me to un|der&s;tand, that his bargains were always condi|tional, and his authors paid in proportion to the &s;ale of their works.</P>
<P>Having therefore &s;ettled the&s;e conditions, which (I do a&s;&s;ure you) were not very advantageous to me, he a&s;&s;igned me a &s;ubject for a ballad, which was to be fini&s;hed in two hours; and I retired to my garret in order to perform his injunction.&mdash;As the theme happened to &s;uit my fancy, I com|pleated a pretty &s;ort of an ode, within the time pre&s;cribed, and brought it to him, big with hope of profit and applau&s;e. He read it in a twinkling, and to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, told me, it would not do; though indeed, he owned I wrote a good hand, and &s;pelled very well, but my language
<PB N="285" REF="299">
was too high flown, and of con&s;equence not at all adapted to the capacity and ta&s;te of his cu|&s;tomers.&mdash;I promi&s;ed to rectify that mi&s;take, and in half an hour humbled my &s;tile to the compre|hen&s;ion of vulgar readers; he approved of the alteration, and gave me &s;ome hopes of &s;ucceed|ing in time, though he ob&s;erved, that my per|formance was very deficient in that quaintne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion that plea&s;es the multitude: However, to encourage me, he ventured the expence of printing and paper, and, if I remember a-right, my &s;hare of the &s;ale amounted to four pence half|penny.</P>
<P>From that day, I &s;tudied the Grub-&s;treet man|ner with great diligence, and at length became &s;uch a proficient, that my works were in great reque&s;t among the mo&s;t polite of the chairmen, draymen, hackney-coachmen, footmen and &s;erv|ing maids: Nay, I have enjoyed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my productions adorned with cuts, pa&s;ted upon the wall as ornaments in beer-cellars and cobler's &s;talls; and have actually heard them &s;ung in clubs of &s;ub&s;tantial trade&s;men.&mdash;But empty prai&s;e (you know, my dear friend) will not &s;upply the cravings of nature.&mdash;I found my|&s;elf in danger of &s;tarving in the mid&s;t of all my fame; for of ten &s;ongs I compo&s;ed, it was well if two had the good fortune to plea&s;e.&mdash;For this rea&s;on I turned my thoughts to pro&s;e, and during a tract of gloomy weather, publi&s;hed an apparition, on the &s;ub&s;tance of which I &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted very comfortably a whole month: I have made many a good meal upon a mon&s;ter; a rape has often afforded me great &s;atisfaction; but a murder, well-timed, was my never-failing re|&s;ource.

<P>Not to trouble you with idle particulars, I carried my tragedy to his lord&s;hip's lodgings, and &s;ent it up along with Mr. Supple's letter, by one of his &s;ervants, who de&s;ired me, by his lord's order, to return in a week.&mdash;I did &s;o, and was admitted to his lord&s;hip, who received me very courteou&s;ly, told me he had peru&s;ed my play, which he thought, on the whole, was the be&s;t <HI>coup d'e&s;&s;ai</HI> he had ever &s;een; but that he had marked &s;ome places in the margin, which he ima|gined might be altered for the better.&mdash;I was tran&s;ported with this reception, and promi&s;ed (with many acknowledgments of his lord&s;hip's genero&s;ity) to be governed &s;olely by his advice and direction.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well then (&s;aid he) write another fair copy with the alterations I have propo&s;ed, and bring it to me as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, for I am re&s;olved to have it brought on the &s;tage this winter."&mdash;</Q>You may be &s;ure I &s;et about this ta&s;k with alacrity, and although I found his lord&s;hip's remarks much more nume|rous, and of le&s;s importance than I expected, I thought it was not my intere&s;t to di&s;pute upon trifles with my patron; therefore new-modelled it according to his de&s;ire, in le&s;s than a month.</P>
<P>When I waited upon him with the manu&s;cript, I found one of the actors at breakfa&s;t with his lord&s;hip, who immediately introduced him to my acquaintance, and de&s;ired him to read a &s;cene of my play.&mdash;This he performed very much to my &s;atisfaction, with regard to empha&s;is and pro|nounciation;
<PB N="288" REF="302">
but he &s;ignified his di&s;gu&s;t at &s;eve|ral words in every page, which I pre&s;uming to defend, Lord Rattle told me, with a peremptory look, I mu&s;t not pretend to di&s;pute with him, who had been a player the&s;e twenty years, and under&s;tood the oeconomy of the &s;tage better than any man living. I was forced to &s;ubmit, and his lord&s;hip propo&s;ed the &s;ame actor &s;hould read the whole play, in the evening, before &s;ome gen|tlemen of his acquaintance, whom he would con|vene at his lodgings for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at the reading; and I prote&s;t to you, my dear friend, I never underwent &s;uch a &s;evere trial in the whole cour&s;e of my life, as at that juncture! for although the player might be a very hone&s;t man and a good performer, he was exce&s;&s;ively illiterate and a&s;&s;uming, and made a thou&s;and frivolous objections, which I was not permitted to an&s;wer: However, the piece was very much applauded on the whole; the gentle|men pre&s;ent, who I under&s;tood were men of fortune, promi&s;ed to countenance and &s;upport it as much as they could; and Lord Rattle a&s;&s;uring me, that he would act the part of a careful nur&s;e to it, de&s;ired me to carry it home and alter it im|mediately according to their remarks:&mdash;I was fain to acquie&s;ce in his determination, and fulfilled his injunctions with all the expedition in my power; but before I could pre&s;ent the new copy, my good friend Mr. Supple had di&s;po&s;ed of his property and patent to one Mr. Brayer; &s;o that fre&s;h intere&s;t was to be made with the new manager.&mdash;This ta&s;k Lord Rattle undertook, having &s;ome acquaintance with him, and recom|mended my performance &s;o &s;trongly, that it was received.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="303">
I looked upon my&s;elf now, as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of all my labour: I waited a few days in expectation of its being put into rehear&s;al, and wondering at the delay, applied to my worthy patron, who excu&s;ed Mr. Brayer on account of the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was involved; and bid me beware of teizing the patentee.&mdash;I trea&s;ured up this caution, and exerted my patience three weeks longer; at the end of which, his lord&s;hip gave me to under|&s;tand that Mr. Brayer had read my play, and owned it had undubitable merit; but as he had long been pre-engaged to another author, he could not po&s;&s;ibly repre&s;ent it that &s;ea&s;on; though if I would re&s;erve it for the next, and in the interim make &s;uch alterations as he had propo&s;ed by ob&s;ervations on the margin, I might depend upon his compliance.</P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck at this di&s;appointment, I could not, for &s;ome minutes, utter one &s;yllable: At length, however, I complained bitterly of the manager's in&s;incerity in amu&s;ing me &s;o long, when he knew from the beginning, that he could not gratify my de&s;ire.&mdash;But his lord&s;hip reprimanded me for my freedom, &s;aid Mr. Brayer was a man of honour, and imputed his behaviour with re|&s;pect to me, to nothing el&s;e but forgetfulne&s;s.&mdash;And indeed I have had &s;ome rea&s;on &s;ince that time, to be convinced of his bad memory; for, in &s;pite of appearances, I will not allow my&s;elf to in|terpret his conduct any other way.&mdash;Lord Rattle ob&s;erving me very much affected with my di&s;ap|pointment, offered his intere&s;t to bring on my play at the other hou&s;e, which I eagerly accept|ing, he forthwith wrote a letter of recommenda|tion to Mr. Bellower, actor, and prime mini&s;ter
<PB N="290" REF="304">
to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that theatre; and de&s;ired me to deliver it with my tragedy, without lo&s;s of time.&mdash;Accordingly, I ha&s;tened to his hou&s;e, where after having waited a whole hour in a lobby, I was admitted to his pre&s;ence, and my performance received with great &s;tate.&mdash;He told me he was extremely bu&s;y at pre&s;ent, but he would peru&s;e it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and bid me call again in a week. I took my leave, not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the port and &s;upercilious beha|viour of this &s;tage-player, who had not treated me with good manners; and began to think the dig|nity of a poet greatly impaired &s;ince the days of Euripedes and Sophocles; but all this was no|thing in compari&s;on of what I have &s;ince ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. Random, I went back at the ap|pointed time, and was told that Mr. Bellower was engaged, and could not &s;ee me.&mdash;I repeated my vi&s;it a few days after, and having waited a con&s;iderable time, was &s;avoured with an audience, during which, he &s;aid, he had not as yet read my play.&mdash;Nettled at this u&s;age, I could con|tain my&s;elf no longer, but telling him, I imagined he would have paid more deference to Lord Rattle's recommendation, demanded my manu&s;cript with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;ent|ment.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, (&s;aid he, in a theatrical tone) with all my heart."&mdash;</Q>Then pulling out a draw|er of the bureau at which he &s;at, he took out a bundle, and threw it upon a table that was near him, pronouncing the word <Q REND="inline">"There,"</Q> with great di&s;dain.&mdash;I took it up, and perceiving with &s;ome &s;urprize, that it was a comedy, told him, it did not belong to me; upon which he offered me another, which I al&s;o di&s;claimed&mdash;A third was produced, and rejected for the &s;ame rea&s;on.

length, he pulled out a whole handful, and &s;pread them before me, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There are &s;even&mdash;take which you plea&s;e&mdash;or take them all."&mdash;</Q>I &s;ingled out my own, and went away, &s;truck dumb with admiration at what I had &s;een&mdash;not &s;o much on account of his in&s;olence, as of the number of new plays, which from this cir|cum&s;tance, I concluded were yearly offered to the &s;tage.&mdash;You may be &s;ure I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron, who did not receive it with all the indignation I expected; but taxed me with precipitation, and told me, I mu&s;t lay my account with bearing the humours of the players, if I intended to write for the &s;tage.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is now no other remedy (&s;aid he) but to keep it till the next &s;ea&s;on for Mr. Brayer, and alter it at your lei&s;ure, in the &s;um|mer, according to his directions."&mdash;</Q>I was now reduced to a terrible alternative, either to quit all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all along promi&s;ed my&s;elf a large &s;hare of fortune and reputation, or to encounter eight long months of adver&s;ity in preparing for, and expecting its appear|ance.&mdash;This la&s;t pennance, painful as it was, &s;eemed mo&s;t eligible to my re&s;tection at that time, and therefore I re&s;olved to undergo it.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould I tire you with particulars of no con&s;equence? I wre&s;tled with extreme poverty, until the time of my probation was expired; and went to my Lord Rattle in order to remind him of my affair, when I under&s;tood, to my great concern, that his lord&s;hip was on the point of going abroad, and, which was &s;till more unfor|tunate for me, Mr. Brayer had gone into the country; &s;o that my generous patron had it not in his power to introduce me per&s;onally, as he
<PB N="292" REF="306">
intended: However, he wrote a very &s;trong let|ter to the manager in my favour, and put him in mind of the promi&s;e he had made in behalf of my play.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was certified of Brayer's return, I went to his hou&s;e with this letter, but was told he was gone out.&mdash;I called again next day early in the morning, received the &s;ame an&s;wer, and was de&s;ired to leave my name and bu&s;ine&s;s; I did &s;o, and returned the day after, when the &s;ervant &s;till affirmed that his ma&s;ter was gone abroad; though I perceived him, as I re|tired, ob&s;erving me through a window.&mdash;In|cen&s;ed at this di&s;covery, I went to a coffee-hou&s;e hard by, and inclo&s;ing his lord&s;hip's letter in one from my&s;elf, demanding a categorical an&s;wer, I &s;ent it to his hou&s;e by a porter, who returned in a few minutes, and told me Mr. Brayer would be glad to &s;ee me at that in&s;tant.&mdash;I obeyed the &s;ummons, and was received with &s;uch profu&s;ion of compliments and apologies, that my re&s;ent|ment immediately &s;ub&s;ided, and I was even in pain for the concern which this hone&s;t man &s;hewed at the mi&s;take of his &s;ervant, who, it &s;eems, had been ordered to deny him to every body but me.&mdash;He expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t veneration for his good and noble friend Lord Rattle, whom he &s;hould always be proud to &s;erve; promi&s;ed to peru&s;e the play with all di&s;patch, and give me a meeting upon it; and as a te&s;timony of his e&s;teem, made me a pre&s;ent of a general order for the &s;ea&s;on, by which I would be admitted to any part of the theatre.&mdash;This was a very agreeable compli|ment to me, who&s;e greate&s;t plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted in &s;eeing dramatic performances, and you need not doubt that I often availed my&s;elf of my privilege.
<PB N="293" REF="307">
As I had an opportunity of being behind the &s;cenes when I plea&s;ed, I frequently conver&s;ed with Mr. Brayer about my play, and a&s;ked when he intended to put it into rehear&s;al, but he had always &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands, that it remained with him unopened a con&s;iderable while; and I became very unea&s;y about the &s;ea&s;on, that wa&s;ted apace, when I &s;aw in the papers, another new play ad|verti&s;ed, which had been written, offered, accepted and rehear&s;ed in the compa&s;s of three months, without my knowledge or &s;u&s;picion.&mdash;You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s how much I was confounded at this event! I own to you, that in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my anger, I &s;u&s;pected Mr. Brayer of having acted towards me in the mo&s;t pitiful, perfidious man|ner; and was actually glad at his di&s;appointment in the &s;ucce&s;s of his favourite piece, which by the &s;trength of art, lingered till the third night, and then died in a deplorable manner. But now that pa&s;&s;ion has no &s;hare in my reflection, I am willing to a&s;cribe his behaviour to his want of me|mory or want of judgment, which, you know, are natural defects, that are more worthy of com|pa&s;&s;ion than reproach.</P>
<P>About this time, I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman, who having heard of my tragedy, told me, &s;he was acquainted with the wife of a gentleman, who was very well known to a lady, who had great intere&s;t with a per&s;on who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit, and that if I plea&s;ed, &s;he would u&s;e her influence in my be|half.&mdash;As this nobleman had the character of a Maecenas in the nation, and could &s;tamp a value upon any work by his &s;ole countenance and ap|probation, I accepted her offer with eagerne&s;s, in full confidence of &s;eeing my reputation e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
<PB N="264" REF="308">
and my wi&s;hes fulfilled in a very &s;hort time, provided that I &s;hould have the good for|tune to plea&s;e his Lord&s;hip's ta&s;te. I withdrew the manu&s;cript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and committed it to the care of this gentlewoman, who laboured &s;o effectually in my intere&s;t, that in le&s;s than a month it was conveyed to the Earl, and in a few weeks after, I had the &s;atisfaction to hear, that he had read, and approved it very much. Tran&s;ported with this piece of intelligence, I flattered my&s;elf with the hopes of his intere&s;ting him&s;elf in its favour; but hearing no more of the matter in three whole months, I began (God forgive me) to &s;u&s;pect the veracity of the per&s;on who brought me the good tidings, for I thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that a man of his rank and character, who knew the difficulty of writing a good tra|gedy, and under&s;tood the dignity of the work, &s;hould read and applaud an e&s;&s;ay of this kind, without feeling an inclination to befriend the author, whom his countenance alone could rai&s;e above dependance.&mdash;But it was not long before I &s;ound my friends very much wronged by my opinion.</P>
<P>You mo&s;t know, that the civilities I had re|ceived from Lord Rattle, and the de&s;ire he ma|nife&s;ted to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of my play, en|couraged me to write an account of my bad for|tune to his Lord&s;hip, who conde&s;cended &s;o far as to de&s;ire, by letter, a young Squire of a great e&s;tate, with whom he was intimate, to e&s;pou&s;e my cau&s;e, and in particular, make me acquainted with one Mr. Marmozet a celebrated player, who had lately appeared on the &s;tage with a&s;toni&s;hing eclat, and bore &s;uch &s;way in the hou&s;e where he acted, that the managers dur&s;t not refu&s;e any
<PB N="295" REF="309">
thing he recommended. The young gentleman whom Lord Rattle had employed for this purpo&s;e, being diffident of his own intere&s;t with Mr. Mar|mozet, had recour&s;e to a nobleman of his ac|quaintance, who, at his &s;ollicitation, was &s;o good as to introduce me to him; and the conver&s;ation turning upon my performance, I was not a little &s;urprized, as well as plea&s;ed to hear, that Earl Sheerwit had &s;poke very much in its prai&s;e, and even &s;ent Mr. Marmozet the copy, with a me&s;&s;age expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire that he would act in it next &s;ea|&s;on&mdash;Nor was this favourite actor backward in commending the piece, which he mentioned with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of regard, that I do not chu&s;e to repeat; a&s;&s;uring me that he would appear in it, provided he &s;hould be engaged to play at all during the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. In the mean time, he de&s;ired I would give him leave to peru&s;e it in the country, whither he intended to remove next day, that he might have lei&s;ure to con&s;ider and point out &s;uch alterations as might, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>jeu de theatre;</HI> and took my direction, that he might communicate by letter, the ob&s;ervations he &s;hould make. Tru&s;ting to the&s;e a&s;&s;urances and the intere&s;t which had been made in my behalf, I hugged my&s;elf in the ex|pectation of &s;eeing it, not only acted, but acted to the greate&s;t advantage, which I thought could not fail of recompen&s;ing me in an ample manner, for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone: But &s;ix weeks being elap&s;ed, I did not know how to reconcile Mr. Marmozet's &s;ilence, with his promi&s;e of writing to me in ten days after he &s;et out for the country; however, I was at la&s;t fa|voured with a letter, importing that he had made &s;ome remarks on my tragedy, which he would
<PB N="296" REF="310">
freely impart at meeting, and advi&s;ing me to put it, without lo&s;s of time, into the hands of that ma|nager, who had the be&s;t company: for he him|&s;elf was quite uncertain, whether or not he &s;hould be engaged that winter.&mdash;I was a good deal alarmed at this la&s;t part of his letter, and advi&s;ed about it with a friend, who told me, it was a plain indication of Mr. Marmozet's de&s;ire to be rid of his promi&s;e: that his pretended un|certainty about acting next winter, was no other than a &s;candalous eva&s;ion; for to his certain know|ledge, he was already engaged, or at lea&s;t, in terms with Mr. Vandal; and that his de&s;ign was to di&s;appoint me, in favour of a new comedy, which he had purcha&s;ed of the author, and in|tended to bring upon the &s;tage for his own ad|vantage.&mdash;In &s;hort, my dear Sir, this per&s;on, who, I mu&s;t own, is of a very &s;anguine complexion, handled the moral character of Mr. Marmozet with &s;uch &s;everity, that I began to &s;u&s;pect him of &s;ome particular prejudice, and put my&s;elf upon my guard again&s;t his in&s;inuations.&mdash;I ought to crave pardon for this tedious narration of trivial circum|&s;tances, which, however intere&s;ting they may be to me, mu&s;t certainly be very dry and in&s;ipid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair.&mdash;But I under&s;tand the meaning of your looks, and will proceed.&mdash;Well, Sir, Mr. Marmozet, upon his return to town, treated me with uncommon complai&s;ance, and invited me to his lodgings, where he propo&s;ed to communicate his remarks, which I confe&s;s were more unfavourable than I expected; but I an&s;wered his objections, and, as I thought, brought him over to my opinion; for, on the whole, he &s;ignified the highe&s;t approbation of the performance.&mdash;In the cour&s;e of our di&s;|pute,
<PB N="297" REF="311">
I was not a little &s;urprized to find this poor gentleman's memory &s;o treacherous as to let him forget what he had &s;aid to me, before he went out of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwit's opinion of my play, which he now profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ig|norant of; and I was extremely mortified at hearing from his own mouth, that his intere&s;t with Mr. Vandal was &s;o very low, as to be in|&s;ufficient of it&s;elf, to bring a new piece upon the &s;tage. I then begged his advice, and he coun&s;elled me to apply to Earl Sheerwit for a me&s;&s;age in my favour to the manager, who would not pre&s;ume to refu&s;e any thing recommended by &s;o great a man; and he was &s;o kind as to promi&s;e to &s;econd this me&s;&s;age with all his power.&mdash;I had imme|diate recour&s;e to the worthy gentlewoman my friend already mentioned, who opened the chan|nels of her conveyance with &s;uch expedition, that in few days, I had a promi&s;e of the me&s;&s;age, pro|vided I could a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of Mr. Vandal's being uningaged to any other; for his Lord&s;hip did not chu&s;e to conde&s;cend &s;o far, until he &s;hould under&s;tand that there was a probability (at lea&s;t) of &s;ucceeding; at the &s;ame time in which I was ble&s;&s;ed with this piece of news, I was &s;tartled at another, by the &s;ame canal of communication; which was, that Mr. Marmozet, before he ad|vi&s;ed me to this application, had informed the Earl, that he had read my play, and found it altogether unfit for the &s;tage.&mdash;Though I could not doubt the certainty of this intelligence, I be|lieved there was &s;ome mi&s;apprehen&s;ion in the ca&s;e; and without taking any notice of it, told Mr. Marmozet the an&s;wer I had been favoured with; upon which, he te&s;tified much joy, and promi&s;ed to a&s;k Mr. Vandal the que&s;tion propo&s;ed.&mdash;I
<PB N="298" REF="312">
waited upon him in a day or two, when he gave me to under&s;tand, that Mr. Vandal having pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf free of all engagements, he had put my play into his hands, and repre&s;ented it as a piece &s;trongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit, who (he a&s;&s;ured him) would honour him with a me&s;&s;age in its favour; and he de&s;ired me to call for an an&s;wer at Mr. Vandal's hou&s;e, in three days.&mdash;I followed his directions, and &s;ound the manager, who, being made acquainted with my bu&s;ine&s;s, owned, that Mr. Marmozet had given him a manu&s;cript play, but denied that he had mentioned Earl Sheerwit's name.&mdash;When I in|formed him of the circum&s;tances of the affair, he &s;aid, he had no engagement with any author; that he would read my tragedy forthwith; and did not believe he &s;hould venture to reject it in con|tradiction to his Lord&s;hip's opinion, for which he had the utmo&s;t veneration, but put it into re|hear&s;al without lo&s;s of time.&mdash;I was &s;o much intoxicated with this encouragement, that I over|looked the my&s;terious conduct of Mr. Marmozet, and attended the manager at the time appointed, when, to my infinite confu&s;ion! he pronounced my play improper for the &s;tage, and rejected it accordingly. As &s;oon as I could recollect my&s;elf from the di&s;order into which this unexpected re|fu&s;al had thrown me, I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of hearing his objections, which were &s;o groundle&s;s, indi&s;tinct and unintelligible, that I per&s;uaded my|&s;elf he had not at all peru&s;ed the piece, but had been prompted by &s;omebody who&s;e le&s;&s;ons he had not rightly retained. However, I have been &s;ince informed, that the poor man's head, which was not naturally very clear, had been di&s;ordered with &s;uper|&s;tition, and that he laboured under the tyranny

of a wife, and the terrors of hell fire at the &s;ame time.&mdash;Precipitated in this manner, from the highe&s;t pinnacle of hope, to the aby&s;s of de&s;pon|dence, I was ready to &s;ink under the burthen of my affliction; and in the bitterne&s;s of my angui&s;h, could not help entertaining &s;ome doubts of Mr. Marmozet's integrity, when I recollected and compared the circum&s;tances of his conduct to|wards me. I was encouraged in this &s;u&s;picion, by being told, that my Lord Sheerwit had &s;poke of his character with great contempt; and in par|ticular, re&s;ented his in&s;olence in oppo&s;ing his own ta&s;te to that of his Lord&s;hip, concerning my tra|gedy.&mdash;While I he&s;itated between different opi|nions of the matter, that friend, who (as told you before) was a little hot-headed, favoured me with a vi&s;it, and having heard a circum&s;tantial account of the whole affair, could not contain his indig|nation, but affirmed without ceremony, that Marmozet was the &s;ole occa&s;ion of my di&s;appoint|ment; that he had acted from fir&s;t to la&s;t with the mo&s;t perfidious di&s;&s;imulation, cajoling with in&s;inu|ating civilities, while he underhand employed all his art and influence to prejudice the ignorant manager again&s;t my performance; that nothing could equal his hypocri&s;y, but his avarice, which ingro&s;&s;ed the faculties of his &s;oul &s;o much, that he &s;crupled not to be guilty of the meane&s;t practices to gratify that for|did appetite; that in con&s;equence of this di&s;po&s;ition, he had pro&s;tituted his honour in betraying my in|experience, and in undermining the intere&s;t of another author of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, who had al&s;o offered a tragedy to the &s;tage, which he thought would interfere with the &s;ucce&s;s of the comedy he had bought, and determined to bring on at all events.</P>

I was &s;hocked at the de&s;cription of &s;uch a mon|&s;ter, which I could not believe exi&s;ted in the world, bad as it is, and argued again&s;t the a&s;&s;e|verations of my friend, by demon&s;trating the bad policy of &s;uch behaviour, which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author; and the &s;mall temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozet's figure and &s;ucce&s;s, could have to con&s;ult his intere&s;t in &s;uch a groveling manner, which mu&s;t create contempt and abhorrence of him in his patrons, and effectual|ly deprive him of the countenance and protection he now enjoys in &s;uch an eminent degree.&mdash;He pretended to laugh at my &s;implicity, and a&s;ked if I knew for which of his virtues he was &s;o much care&s;&s;ed by the people of fa&s;hion.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is not (&s;aid he) for the qualities of his heart, that this little para&s;ite is invited to the tables of Dukes and Lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment: His avarice they &s;ee not, his ingratitude they feel not, his hy|pocri&s;y accommodates it&s;elf to their humours, and is of con&s;equence plea&s;ing; but he is chiefly courted for his buffoonery, and will be admitted into the choice&s;t parties of the quality for his talent of mimicking Punch and his wife Joan, when a poet of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ge|nius, is not able to attract the lea&s;t regard."&mdash;</Q>God forbid, Mr. Random, that I &s;hould credit a&s;&s;ertions that degrade the dignity of our &s;upe|riors &s;o much, and repre&s;ent that poor man as the mo&s;t abject of all beings!

I looked upon them as the hyperboles of pa&s;&s;ion; and though that comedy of which he &s;poke, did actually appear, I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr. Marmozet, who, I am told, is as much as ever in favour with the Earl; a circum&s;tance that, &s;ure|ly,

<P>Baffled in all my attempts, I de&s;paired of &s;eeing my play acted, and bethought my&s;elf of chu&s;ing &s;ome employment, that might afford a &s;ure, though mean &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but my landlord, to whom I was by this time con&s;iderably indebted, and who had laid his account with having his money paid all in a heap, from the profits of my third night, could not brook his di&s;ap|pointment, therefore made another effort in my behalf, and by dint of intere&s;t, procured a me&s;|&s;age from a lady of fa&s;hion, to Mr. Brayer, who had always profe&s;&s;ed a great veneration for her, de&s;iring that he would &s;et up my play forthwith, and a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he and all her friends would &s;upport it in the performance: To &s;trengthen my intere&s;t, &s;he engaged his be&s;t ac|tors in my cau&s;e; and in &s;hort, exerted her&s;elf &s;o much, that it was again received, and my hopes began to revive.&mdash;But Mr. Brayer, hone&s;t man, was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by bu&s;ine&s;s of va&s;t con&s;equence, though to appearance he had nothing at all to do, that he could not find time to read it until the &s;ea&s;on was pretty far advanced; and read it he mu&s;t, for notwith&s;tanding his having peru&s;ed it before, his memory did not retain one circum&s;tance of the matter.</P>
<P>At length he favoured it with his attention, and having propo&s;ed certain alterations, &s;ent his duty to the lady who patronized it, and promi&s;ed on his honour, to bring it on next winter, provided the&s;e alterations &s;hould be made, and the copy

<P>My condition was rendered de&s;perate by the death of my good friend and landlord, who&s;e executors obtained a judgment again&s;t my effects, which they &s;eized, turning me out into the &s;treet naked, friendle&s;s, and forlorn; there I was ar|re&s;ted at the &s;uit of my taylor, and thrown into this pri&s;on, where I have made &s;hift to live the&s;e five weeks on the bounty of my fellow-pri&s;oners, who, I hope, are not the wor&s;e for the in&s;truction and good offices, by which I manife&s;t my grati|tude; but in &s;pite of all their charitable endea|vours, my life was &s;carce tolerable, until your uncommon benevolence enabled me to enjoy it with comfort.</P>

<P>I Shall not make any reflections on this &s;tory, in the cour&s;e of which the reader mu&s;t per|ceive how egregiou&s;ly the &s;implicity and milky di&s;po&s;ition of this worthy man, had been duped and abu&s;ed by a &s;et of &s;coundrels, who were &s;o habituated to fal&s;hood and equivocation, that I verily believe, they could not utter one &s;yllable of truth, though their lives depended upon their &s;incerity.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding all I had &s;uffered from the knavery and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of mankind, I was amazed, and incen&s;ed at that ba&s;e indiffe|rence which &s;uffered &s;uch uncommon merit as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to langui&s;h in ob&s;curity, and &s;truggle with all the mi&s;eries of a loath&s;ome jail;&mdash;and &s;hould have ble&s;&s;ed the occa&s;ion that &s;ecluded me from &s;uch a perfidious world, had not the re|membrance of the amiable Narci&s;&s;a, pre&s;erved my attachment to that &s;ociety of which &s;he con|&s;tituted a part.&mdash;The picture of that lovely crea|ture was the con&s;tant companion of my &s;olitude:
<PB N="304" REF="318">
How often did I contemplate the re&s;emblance of tho&s;e enchanting features that fir&s;t captivated my heart! How often did I weep over tho&s;e en|dearing &s;cenes which her image recalled! and how often did I cur&s;e my perfidious fate for hav|ing robbed me of the fair original! In vain did my imagination flatter me with &s;chemes of future happine&s;s; &s;urly rea&s;on always interpo&s;ed, and in a moment overthrew the un&s;ub&s;tantial fa|brick, by cha&s;ti&s;ing the extravagance of my hope, and repre&s;enting my unhappy &s;ituation in the right point of view: In vain did I fly for refuge to the amu&s;ements of the place, and engage in the par|ties of Jack&s;on, at cards, billiards, nine-pins, and fives; a train of melancholy thoughts took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, which even the conver&s;a|tion of Melopoyn could not divert.&mdash;I ordered Strap to inquire every day at Banter's lodgings, in expectation of hearing again from my charmer; and my di&s;appointment con&s;iderably augmented any chagrin.&mdash;My affectionate valet was infected with my &s;orrow, and often &s;at with me whole hours without &s;peaking, uttering &s;igh for &s;igh, and &s;hedding tear for tear.&mdash;This fellow&s;hip in|crea&s;ed our di&s;temper; he became incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s, and was di&s;carded by his ma&s;ter; while I &s;eeing my money melt away, without any cer|tainty of deliverance, and in &s;hort, all my hopes fru&s;trated; grew negligent of life, lo&s;t all appe|tite, and degenerated into &s;uch a &s;loven, that during the &s;pace of two months, I was neither wa&s;hed, &s;hifted nor &s;haved; &s;o that my face ren|dered meagre with ab&s;tinence, was ob&s;cured with dirt, and over&s;hadowed with hair, and my whole appearance &s;qualid and even frightful; when, one day, Strap brought me notice, that there was a
<PB N="305" REF="319">
man below who wanted to &s;peak with me. Rou&s;ed at this intelligence, and in full hope of receiving a letter from the dear object of my love, I run down &s;tairs with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and found, to my infinite &s;urprize, my generous uncle Mr. Bowling! Tran&s;ported at the &s;ight, I &s;prung forward to embrace him. Upon which he &s;tarted a&s;ide with great agility, drew his hanger, and put him&s;elf upon his guard, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ava&s;t, brother, ava&s;t! &s;heer off&mdash;Yo ho! you turn|key, why don't you keep a better look out? here's one of your crazy pri&s;oners broke from his la&s;hings, I do &s;uppo&s;e."&mdash;</Q>I could not help laughing heartily at his mi&s;take, which I &s;oon rectified by my voice, which he in&s;tantly recol|lected, and &s;hook me by the hand with great af|fection, te&s;tifying his concern at &s;eeing me in &s;uch a mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>I conducted him to my apartment, where, in pre&s;ence of Strap, whom I introduced to him as one of my be&s;t friends, he let me know, that he was ju&s;t arrived from the coa&s;t of Guinea, after having made a pretty &s;ucce&s;sful voyage, in which he had acted as mate, until the &s;hip was attacked by a French privateer; that the captain being killed during the engagement, he had taken the command, and was &s;o fortunate as to &s;ink the enemy; after which he fell in with a merchant &s;hip from Martinico, laden with &s;ugar, indigo, and &s;ome &s;ilver; and by virtue of his letter of marque, attacked, took, and brought her &s;afe in|to Kin&s;ale in Ireland, where &s;he was condemned as a lawful prize; by which means, he had not only got a pretty &s;um of money, but al&s;o ac|quired the favour of his owners, who had already conferred upon him the command of a large &s;hip,
<PB N="306" REF="320">
mounted with twenty nine-pounders, ready to &s;ail upon a very advantageous voyage, which he was not at liberty to di&s;cover&mdash;And he a&s;&s;ured me, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty he had found me, in con&s;equence of a direction left for him at his lodgings in Wapping</P>
<P>I was rejoiced beyond mea&s;ure, at this account of his good fortune; and, at his de&s;ire, recounted all the adventures that had happened to me &s;ince we parted.&mdash;When he under&s;tood the particulars of Strap's attachment to me, he &s;queezed his hand very cordially, and promi&s;ed to make a man of him; and giving me ten guineas for my pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, took a direction for the taylor who ar|re&s;ted me, and went away, in order to di&s;charge the debt, telling me at parting, that he would &s;oon fetch up all my lee-way with a wet &s;ail.</P>
<P>I was utterly confounded at this &s;udden tran&s;i|tion, which affected me more than any rever&s;e I had formerly felt; and a crowd of incoherent ideas ru&s;hed &s;o impetuou&s;ly upon my imagination, that my rea&s;on could neither &s;eparate nor con|nect them; when Strap, who&s;e joy had mani|fe&s;ted it&s;elf in a thou&s;and fooleries, came into my room with his &s;having uten&s;ils, and without any previous intimation, began to lather my beard, whi&s;tling with great emotion all the while.&mdash;I &s;tarted from my reverie, and being too well ac|quainted with Strap, to tru&s;t my&s;elf in his hands while he was under &s;uch agitation, de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, &s;ent for another barber, and &s;uffered my&s;elf to be trimmed.&mdash;Having performed the ceremony of ablution, I &s;hifted, and dre&s;&s;ing in my gaye&s;t apparel, waited for the return of my uncle, who was agreeably &s;urprized at my &s;ud|den transformation.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="321">
This beneficent kin&s;man had &s;atisfied my cre|ditor, and obtained an order for my di&s;charge, &s;o that I was no longer a pri&s;oner; but as I had &s;ome reluctance to part with my friends and fel|lows in di&s;tre&s;s, I prevailed upon Mr. Bowling to favour us with his company, and invited Mr. Melopoyn and Jack&s;on to &s;pend the evening at my apartment, where I regaled them with a &s;up|per, good wine, and the news of my relea&s;e, on which they heartily congratulated me, notwith|&s;tanding the lo&s;s of my company, which, they were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, they would &s;everely feel.&mdash;As for Jack&s;on, his misfortune made &s;o little im|pre&s;&s;ion on him&s;elf, and he was altogether &s;o loo&s;e, indifferent and indi&s;creet, that I could &s;carce pity his &s;ituation: But I had conceived a veneration and friend&s;hip for the poet, who was in all re&s;pects, an object much more worthy of compa&s;&s;ion and regard.&mdash;When our gue&s;ts with|drew, and my uncle had retired, with an inten|tion to vi&s;it me next morning I made up a bundle of &s;ome linnen, and other nece&s;&s;aries, and bid|ing Strap carry them to Mr. Melopoyn's lodg|ing, went thither my&s;elf, and pre&s;&s;ed it upon his acceptance with five guineas, which with much difficulty he received, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that he &s;hould never have it in his power to make &s;atisfaction. I then a&s;ked if I could &s;erve him any other way, to which he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have already done too much,"</Q> and un|able to contain the emotions of his &s;oul any longer; bur&s;t into tears, and wept aloud.&mdash;Moved at the &s;pectacle, I left him to his repo&s;e, and when my uncle returned in the morning, repre&s;ented his cha|racter in &s;uch a favourable light, that the hone&s;t &s;eaman was affected with his di&s;tre&s;s, and determined
<PB N="308" REF="322">
to follow my example, in pre&s;enting him with five pieces more: Upon which, that I might &s;ave him &s;ome confu&s;ion, I advi&s;ed Mr. Bowling to inclo&s;e it in a letter to be delivered by Strap, after we &s;hould be gone.</P>
<P>This was accordingly done. I took a formal leave of all my acquaintance in the jail, and ju&s;t as I was about to &s;tep into a hackney-coach at the gate, Jack&s;on calling me, I returned, and he a&s;ked me in a whi&s;per, if I could lend him a &s;hilling! His demand being &s;o moderate, and in all likelihood, the la&s;t he would make upon me, I &s;lipt a guinea into his hand, which he no &s;ooner perceived, than he cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O Je&s;us! a guinea!"</Q> then laying hold of a button of my coat, he broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter; and when his convul&s;ion was ended, told me, I was an hone&s;t fellow, and let me go.&mdash;The coachman was ordered to drive to Mr. Bowling's lodgings, where, when we arrived, he entered into a &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e with me, on the &s;ubject of my &s;ituation, and propo&s;ed that I &s;hould &s;ail with him in quality of his Surgeon; in which ca&s;e, he would put me on a method of getting a fortune in a few years, by my own indu&s;try; and a&s;&s;ured me, that I might expect to inherit all that he &s;hould die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, provided I &s;hould &s;urvive him.&mdash;Though I was penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of his genero&s;ity, I was &s;tartled at a propo&s;al that offered violence to my love, and &s;ignified my &s;entiments on that head, which he did not &s;eem to reli&s;h; but ob&s;erved that love was the fruit of idlene&s;s, that when once I &s;hould be employed in bu&s;ine&s;s, and my mind engaged in making money, I would be no more troubled with the&s;e &s;illy notions, which none but your fair-weather

Jacks, who have nothing but their plea&s;ure to mind, ought to entertain.&mdash;I was piqued at this in&s;inuation, which I looked upon as a reproach, and without giving my&s;elf time to deliberate, ac|cepted his offer.&mdash;He was overjoyed at my com|pliance, carried me immediately to his chief owner, with whom a bargain was &s;truck, &s;o that I could not retract with honour, &s;hould I be never &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed thereto.&mdash;That I might not have time to cool, he bid me draw out a li&s;t of medicines for a compliment of five hundred men, adapted to the di&s;tempers of hot climates, and &s;ufficient for a voyage of eighteen months; and carry it to a certain whole&s;ale apothecary, who would al&s;o provide me in two well-qualified mates.&mdash;While I was thus employed, Strap came in, and looked very blank, when he under&s;tood my re&s;olution: However, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome mi|nutes, he in&s;i&s;ted upon going along with me; and at my de&s;ire was made &s;hip's &s;teward by captain Bowling, who promi&s;ed to be at the expence of fitting him out, and to lend him two hundred pounds to purcha&s;e an adventure.</P>
<P>When I had delivered my li&s;t of medicines, cho&s;en a couple of my own countrymen for mates, and be&s;poke a &s;et of chirurgical in&s;truments, my uncle told me, that by his la&s;t voyage, he had cleared almo&s;t three thou&s;and pounds, one thou&s;and of which he would immediately make over and put into my hands; that he would procure for me credit to the value of as much more, in &s;uch goods as would turn to be&s;t account in the country to which we were bound; and that although he looked upon my intere&s;t as his own, he would keep the remaining part of his fortune in his own di&s;po&s;al, with a view of pre&s;erving his inde|pendance,
<PB N="310" REF="324">
and the power of puni&s;hing me, in ca&s;e I &s;hould not make a good u&s;e of what he had already be&s;towed upon me.</P>
<P>Without troubling the reader with an account of the effect which this &s;urprizing genero&s;ity had upon my mind, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that his promi&s;es were in&s;tantly performed, and an invoyce of mer|chandize proper for the voyage pre&s;ented to me, that I might purcha&s;e the goods, and &s;hip them with all expedition.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this hurry the remembrance of my charming Narci&s;&s;a often interpo&s;ed, and made me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all mortals. I was di&s;tracted with the thought of being torn from her, perhaps, for ever; and though the hope of &s;eeing her again, might have &s;upported me under the torments of &s;eparation, I could not reflect upon the angui&s;h &s;he mu&s;t feel at parting with me, and the ince&s;&s;ant &s;orrows to which her tender bo&s;om would be expo&s;ed daring my ab&s;ence, without being pierced with the deepe&s;t affliction! As an imagination was daily and nightly upon the rack to invent &s;ome me|thod of mitigating this cruel &s;troke, or at lea&s;t of acquitting my love and honour in the opinion of that gentle creature, I at length &s;tumbled upon an expedient, with which the reader will be made acquainted in due time; and in con&s;equence of my determination, became le&s;s unea&s;y and di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>My bu&s;ine&s;s being fini&s;hed, and the &s;hip ready to &s;ail, I re&s;olved to make my la&s;t appearance among my acquaintance at the other end of the town, where I had not been &s;een &s;ince my impri&s;on|ment; and as I had, by the advice of my uncle, taken off &s;ome very rich cloaths for &s;ale, I put on the gaye&s;t &s;uit in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and went in a chair to the coffee-hou&s;e I u&s;ed to frequent,

where I found my friend Banter &s;o confounded at the magnificence of my dre&s;s, that when I made up to him, he gazed at me with a look of a&s;toni&s;hment, without being able, for &s;ome mi|nutes, to open his lips;&mdash;then pulling me a&s;ide by the &s;leeve, and fixing his eyes on mine, acco&s;t|ed me in this manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Random, where the devil have you been! eh?&mdash;What is the meaning of all this finery?&mdash;Oho!

Her habitation being quite &s;olitary, we arrived at the door without being ob&s;erved, when I ordered my companion to enter by him&s;elf, and in ca&s;e there &s;hould be company with her, deliver a letter which I had wrote for the purpo&s;e, and &s;ay that a friend of hers in London, under&s;tanding that he intended to travel this road, had com|mitted it to his care.&mdash;He rapped at the door, to which the good old matron coming, told him, that being a lone woman, he mu&s;t excu&s;e her, if &s;he did not open it, until he had declared his name and bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;He an&s;wered, that his name was unknown to her, and that his bu&s;ine&s;s was to deliver a letter, which (to free her from all manner of apprehen&s;ion) he would convey to her through the &s;pace between the door and thre&s;hold.&mdash;This he in&s;tantly performed; and &s;he no &s;ooner read the contents, which &s;pecified my being pre&s;ent, than &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the per&s;on who wrote this letter be at hand, let him &s;peak, that I may be a&s;&s;ured by his voice whether or not I may &s;afely admit him."&mdash;</Q>I forthwith applied my mouth to the key-hole, and pronoun|ced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear mother, you need not be afraid, it is I, &s;o much indebted to your goodne&s;s, who now crave admittance."&mdash;</Q>She knew my voice, and opening the door immediately, re|ceived me with a truly maternal affection, mani|fe&s;ting by the tears &s;he let fall, her concern le&s;t I

&s;hould be di&s;covered, for &s;he had been informed of every thing that had happened between Nar|ci&s;&s;a and me, from the dear captive's own mouth.&mdash;When I explained the motive of my journey, which was no other than a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the object of my love before I &s;hould quit the king|dom, that I might in per&s;on convince her of the nece&s;&s;ity I was under to leave her, reconcile her to that event, by de&s;cribing the advantages that in all probability would attend it, repeat my vows of eternal con&s;tancy, and enjoy the melancholy plea&s;ure of a tender embrace at parting&mdash;I &s;ay, when I had thus &s;ignified my intention, Mrs. Sagely told me, that Narci&s;&s;a, upon her return from the Bath, had been &s;o &s;trictly watched, that no body, but one or two of the &s;ervants de|voted to her brother, was admitted to her pre&s;ence; that afterwards &s;he had been a little enlarged, and was permitted to &s;ee company; during which in|dulgence, &s;he had been &s;everal times at her cot|tage: but of late &s;he had been betrayed by one of the &s;ervants, who di&s;covered to the &s;quire, that he had once carried a letter from her to the po&s;t-hou&s;e directed to me; upon which informa|tion, &s;he was now more confined than ever, and that I could have no chance of &s;eeing her, unle&s;s I would run the ri&s;que of getting into the garden, where &s;he and her maid were every day allowed to take the air, and lie hid until I &s;hould have an opportunity of &s;peaking to them&mdash;an adventure which would be attended with &s;uch danger, that no man in his right wits would attempt it.&mdash;This enterprize, hazardous as it was, I re&s;olved to perform, in &s;pite of all the arguments of Mrs. Sagely, who rea&s;oned, chid, and intreated by turns; and the tears and prayers of Strap, who

conjured me on his knees, to have more regard to my&s;elf as well as to him, than to tempt my own de&s;truction in &s;uch a precipitate manner. But I was deaf to every thing, but the &s;ugge&s;tions of my love; and ordering him to return immediately with the hor&s;es to the inn from whence we &s;et out, and wait for my coming in that place, he at fir&s;t peremptorily refu&s;ed to leave me, until I per&s;waded him, that if our hor&s;es &s;hould remain where they were 'till day-light, they would certainly be di&s;covered, and the whole county alarmed. On this con&s;ideration, he took his leave in a &s;orrow|ful plight, ki&s;&s;ed my hand, and weeping, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God knows if ever I &s;hall &s;ee you again."&mdash;</Q>My kind landlady finding me ob&s;tinate, gave me her be&s;t advice how to behave in the execution of my project; and after having per&s;waded me to take a little refre&s;hment, accommodated me with a bed, and left me to my repo&s;e.&mdash;Early in the morning, I got up, and armed with a couple of loaded pi&s;tols and a hanger, went to the back of the Squire's garden, climbed over the wall, and, according to Mrs. Sagely's direction, concealed my&s;elf in a thicket, hard by an alcove which ter|minated a walk at a good di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, which (I was told) my mi&s;tre&s;s chiefly frequented.&mdash;Here I ab&s;conded from five a-clock in the morning to &s;ix in the evening, without &s;eeing a human creature; at la&s;t I perceived two women approaching, whom by my throbbing heart I &s;oon recogniz'd to be the adorable Narci&s;&s;a and Mi&s;s Williams. I felt the &s;tronge&s;t agitation of &s;oul at the &s;ight; and gue&s;&s;ing that they would repo&s;e them&s;elves in the alcove, I &s;tept into it unperceiv'd, and laid upon the &s;tone-table a picture of my&s;elf in miniature, for which I had &s;at in London, pur|po&s;ing

I expo&s;ed it in this manner, as an in|troduction to my own appearance, which, with|out &s;ome previous intimation, I was afraid might have an unlucky effect upon the delicate nerves of my fair en&s;laver; and then withdrew into the thicket, where I could hear their di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;uit my&s;elf to the circum&s;tances of the occa&s;ion.&mdash;As they advanced, I ob&s;erved an air of melan|choly in the countenance of Narci&s;&s;a, blended with &s;uch un&s;peakable &s;weetne&s;s, that I could &s;carce refrain from flying into her arms, and ki&s;&s;ing away the pearly drop that &s;tood collected in each bewitching eye.

But becau&s;e my words are incapable of doing ju&s;tice to this affecting circum&s;tance, I am obliged to draw a veil over it, and ob&s;erve, that I returned in the dark to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Sagely, who was overjoy'd to hear of my &s;ucce&s;s, and oppo&s;ed the tumults of my grief with &s;uch &s;trength of rea&s;on, that my mind regained in &s;ome mea&s;ure its tranquility; and that very night, after having forced upon this good gentlewoman a pur&s;e of twenty guineas, as a token of my gratitude and e&s;teem, I took my leave of her, &s;et out on foot for the inn, where my arrival freed hone&s;t Strap from the horrors of unutterable dread.</P>
<P>We took hor&s;e immediately, and alighted early next morning at Deal, where I found my uncle in great concern on account of my ab&s;ence, be|cau&s;e he had received his di&s;patches, and mu&s;t have weighed with the fir&s;t fair wind, whether I had been on board or not.&mdash;Next day, a bri&s;k ea&s;terly gale &s;pringing up, we &s;et &s;ail, and in eight and forty hours got clear of the Channel.</P>
<P>When we were about 200 leagues from the Land's end, the captain taking me apart into the cabbin, told me, that, now he was per|mitted by his in&s;tructions, he would di&s;clo&s;e the intent and de&s;tination of our voyage: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;hip, &s;aid he, which has been fitted out at a great expence, is bound for the coa&s;t of Guinea, where we &s;hall exchange part of our cargo for &s;laves and gold du&s;t; from thence we will tran&s;port our negroes to Buenos Ayres in New-Spain, where (by virtue of pa&s;&s;ports obtained from our own court, and that of Madrid) we will di&s;po&s;e of them and the goods that re|main on board for &s;ilver, by means of our &s;upercargo, who is perfectly well acquainted

with the coa&s;t, the lingo and inhabitants."&mdash;</Q>Being thus let into the &s;ecret of our expedition, I borrowed of the &s;upercargo a Spani&s;h grammar, dictionary, and &s;ome other books of the &s;ame language, which I &s;tudied with &s;uch application, that before we arrived in New-Spain, I could maintain a conver&s;ation with him in that tongue.&mdash;Being arrived in the warm latitudes, I ordered (with the captain's con&s;ent) the whole &s;hip's com|pany to be blooded and purged, my&s;elf under|going the &s;ame evacuation, in order to prevent tho&s;e dangerous fevers to which northern con&s;titu|tions are &s;ubject in hot climates; and I have rea&s;on to believe that this precaution was not un|&s;erviceable, for we lo&s;t but one &s;ailor during our whole pa&s;&s;age to the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>One day, when we had been about five weeks at &s;ea, we de&s;cried to windward a large &s;hip bear|ing down upon us with all the &s;ail &s;he could carry. Upon which, my uncle ordered the &s;tudding-&s;ails to be hoi&s;ted, and the &s;hip to be cleared for en|gaging; but finding, that (to u&s;e the &s;eamen's phra&s;e) we were very much wronged by the &s;hip which had us in chace, and which by this time had hoi&s;ted French colours, he commanded the &s;tudding-&s;ails to be taken in, the cour&s;es to be clewed up, the main-top-&s;ail to be backed, the tompions to be taken out of the guns, and every man to repair to his quarters. While every body was bu&s;ied in the performance of the&s;e orders, Strap came upon the quarter-deck, trembling, and and looking agha&s;t, and, with a voice half &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by fear, a&s;ked if I thought we were a match for the ve&s;&s;el in pur&s;uit of us.

My uncle, incen&s;ed at his pu&s;ilanimity, bid me &s;end him down in&s;tantly, that his fear might not in&s;ect the &s;hip's company; whereupon I told the poor &s;teward, that I had begg'd him for an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and de&s;ired him to go down and help my mates to get ready the in&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the &s;atisfaction he mu&s;t have felt at the&s;e tidings, he affected a &s;hyne&s;s of quitting the upper deck; and &s;aid, he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do his duty above board, for he believed him&s;elf as well prepared for death as any man in the &s;hip, no di&s;paragement to me or the captain.&mdash;I was di&s;gu&s;ted at this affectation, and in order to puni&s;h his hypocri&s;y, a&s;&s;ured him, he might either go down to the cockpit, or &s;tay upon deck during the engagement. Alarmed at this indifference, he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, to oblige you, I'll go down, but remember it is more for your &s;ake than my own."</Q> So &s;aying, he di&s;appeared in a twink|ling, without waiting for an an&s;wer.&mdash;By this time we could ob&s;erve two tire of guns in the &s;hip which pur&s;ued us, and which was now but two &s;hort miles a&s;tern. This di&s;covery had an evident effect upon the &s;ailors, who did not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that we &s;hould be tore to pieces, and blown out of the water, and that if in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould lo&s;e their precious limbs, they mu&s;t go a|begging for life, for there was no provi&s;ion made

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I am invited to the Villa of a Spani&s;h Don, where we meet with an Engli&s;h gentleman, and make a very intere&s;ting di&s;covery&mdash;we leave Buenos Ayres, and arrive at Ja|maica.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR &s;hip being freed from the di&s;agreeable lading of Negroes, to whom indeed I had been a mi&s;erable &s;lave, &s;ince our leaving the coa&s;t of Guinea, I began to enjoy my&s;elf, and breathe with plea&s;ure the pure air of Paraguay, this part of which is reckoned the Montpelier of South America, and has obtained, on account of its climate, the name of Buenos Ayres.&mdash;It was in this delicious place, that I gave my&s;elf entirely up to the thoughts of my dear Narci&s;&s;a, who&s;e image &s;till kept full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t, and who&s;e charms, enhanced by ab&s;ence, appeared to my imagination, if po&s;&s;ible, more engaging than ever! I calculated the profits of my voyage, which even exceeded my expectation; re&s;olved to purcha&s;e a hand&s;ome &s;ine-cure upon my ar|rival in England, and if I &s;hould find the Squire as aver&s;e to me as ever, marry his &s;i&s;ter by &s;tealth; and in ca&s;e our family &s;hould encrea&s;e, rely upon the genero&s;ity of my uncle, who was by this time worth a con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>While I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with the&s;e agreeable projects, and the tran&s;porting hopes of enjoying
<PB N="326" REF="340">
Narci&s;&s;a, we were very much care&s;&s;ed by the Spani&s;h gentlemen, who frequently formed par|ties of plea&s;ure for our entertainment, in which we made excur&s;ions a good way into the country. Among tho&s;e who &s;ignalized them&s;elves by their civility to us, there was one Don Antonio de Ribera, a very polite young gentleman, with whom I had contracted an intimate friend&s;hip, who invited us one day to his country-hou&s;e, and as a further inducement to our compliance, pro|mi&s;ed to procure for us the company of an En|gli&s;h &s;ignor, who had been &s;ettled in the&s;e parts many years, and acquired the love and e&s;teem of the whole province by his affability, good &s;en&s;e, and honourable behaviour.</P>
<P>We accepted his invitation, and &s;et out for his Villa, where we had not been longer than an hour, when the per&s;on arrived, in who&s;e favour I had been &s;o much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;He was a tall man, remarkably well &s;haped, of a fine mein and appearance commanding re&s;pect, and &s;eemed to be turned of &s;orty; the features of his face were &s;addened with a re&s;erve and gravity, which in other countries would have been thought the ef|fect of melancholy; but here, appeared to have been contracted by his commerce with the Spa|niards, who are remarkable for that &s;everity of countenance: Under&s;tanding from Don Antonio, that we were his countrymen, he &s;aluted us all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ound very complai&s;antly, and fixing his eyes attentively on me, uttered a deep &s;igh.&mdash;I had been &s;truck with a profound veneration for him at his fir&s;t coming into the room; and no &s;ooner ob&s;erved this expre&s;&s;ion of his &s;orrow, directed, as it were, in a particular manner to me, than my heart took part in his grief, I &s;ympathized invo|luntarily,
<PB N="327" REF="341">
and &s;ighed in my turn.&mdash;Having a&s;ked leave of our entertainer, he acco&s;ted us in En|gli&s;h, profe&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing &s;o many of his countrymen in &s;uch a remote place, and a&s;ked the captain, who went by the name of Signor Thoma, from what part of Britain he &s;ailed, and whither he was bound.&mdash;My uncle told him that we had &s;ailed from the river Thames, and were bound for the &s;ame place, by the way of Jamaica, where we intended to take in a lading of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied him&s;elf in the&s;e and other par|ticulars about the &s;tate of the war, he gave us to under&s;tand, that he had a longing de&s;ire to revi&s;it his native country, in con&s;equence of which, he had already tran&s;mitted to Europe the greate&s;t part of his fortune in neutral bottoms, and would willingly embark the re&s;t of it, with him&s;elf, in our &s;hip, provided the captain had no objection to &s;uch a pa&s;&s;enger.&mdash;My uncle very prudently replied, that for his part, he &s;hould be glad of his company, if he could procure the con&s;ent of the governor, without which he dur&s;t not admit him on board, whatever inclination he had to oblige him.&mdash;The gentleman approved of his di&s;|cretion, and telling him, that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the connivance of the gover|nor, who was his good friend, &s;hifted the con|ver&s;ation to another &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I was overjoyed to hear his intention, and al|ready intere&s;ted my&s;elf &s;o much in his favour, that had he been di&s;appointed, I &s;hould have been very unhappy: In the cour&s;e of our entertain|ment, he eyed me with uncommon attachment; I felt a &s;urprizing attraction towards him; when he &s;poke, I li&s;tened with attention and reverence;

<P>When I had thus &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity, I di&s;|covered an inclination to hear the particulars of his &s;tory, which he gratified, by beginning with his marriage, and proceeding to the day of his di&s;appearing, as I have related in the fir&s;t part of my memoirs, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Carele&s;s of life (con|tinued he) and unable to live in a place where every object recalled the memory of my dear Charlotte, whom I had lo&s;t through the bar|barity of an unnatural parent, I took my leave of you, my child, then an infant, with an heart full of unutterable woe, but little &s;u&s;pecting that my father's unkindne&s;s would have de&s;cended to my innocent orphan; and &s;etting out alone, at midnight, for the neare&s;t &s;ea-port, early next morning got on board a &s;hip, bound, as I had heard, for France, and bargaining with the ma&s;ter for my pa&s;|&s;age, bid a long adieu to my native country, and put to &s;ea with the fir&s;t fair wind.

<P>I vi&s;it my old friend Thom&s;on&mdash;we &s;et &s;ail for Europe, meet with an odd ad|venture&mdash;arrive in England&mdash;I ride acro&s;s the country from Port&s;mouth to Su&s;&s;ex&mdash;conver&s;e with Mrs. Sagely, who informs me of Narci&s;&s;a's being in Lon|don&mdash;in con&s;equence of this intelligence, I proceed to Canterbury&mdash;meet with my old friend Morgan&mdash;arrive at London&mdash;vi&s;it Narci&s;&s;a&mdash;introduce my father to her&mdash;he is charmed with her good &s;en&s;e and beauty&mdash;we come to a determination of demanding her brother's con&s;ent to our mar|riage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Enquired, as &s;oon as I got a&s;hore, about my generous companion Mr. Thom&s;on; and hear|ing that he lived in a flouri&s;hing condition, upon the e&s;tate le&s;t to him by his wife's father, who had been dead &s;ome years, I took hor&s;e immedi|ately, with the con&s;ent of Don Rodriguez, who had heard me mention him with great regard,
<PB N="338" REF="352">
and in a few hours reached the place of his ha|bitation.</P>
<P>I &s;hould much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thom&s;on's &s;entiments, to &s;ay barely he was glad to &s;ee me: He felt all that the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip could feel on this occa&s;ion, introduced me to his wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already ble&s;&s;ed him with two fine children; and being as yet ignorant of my cir|cum&s;tances, frankly offered me the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his pur&s;e and intere&s;t. I thanked him for his ge|nerous intention, and made him acquainted with my &s;ituation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and after I had &s;taid with him a whole day and night, accompanied me back to King|&s;ton, to wait upon my father, whom he invited to his hou&s;e: Don Rodriguez complied with his re|que&s;t, and having been hand&s;omely entertained during the &s;pace of a week, returned extremely well &s;atisfied with the behaviour of my friend and his lady, to whom at parting, he pre&s;ented a valuable diamond ring, as a token of his e&s;teem. During the cour&s;e of my conver&s;ation with Mr. Thom&s;on, he let me know, that his and my old com|mander captain Oakhum was dead &s;ome months, and that immediately after his death, a di&s;covery had been made of &s;ome valuable effects that he had feloniou&s;ly &s;ecreted out of a prize, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dr. Mack&s;hane, who was now ac|tually in pri&s;on on that account, and being de|&s;titute of friends, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;olely on the charity of my friend, who&s;e bounty he had implored in the mo&s;t abject manner, after having been the barbarous occa&s;ion of driving him to that terrible extremity on board of the Thunder, which we
<PB N="339" REF="353">
have formerly related.&mdash;What&s;oever this wretch might have been guilty of, I applauded Mr. Thom&s;on's genero&s;ity towards him in his di&s;tre&s;s, which wrought &s;o much upon me al&s;o, that I &s;ent him ten pi&s;toles, in &s;uch a private manner, that he could never know his benefactor.</P>
<P>While my father and I were care&s;&s;ed among the gentlemen on &s;hore, captain Bowling had wrote to his owners, by the packet, which &s;ailed a few days after our arrival, &s;ignifying his pro&s;perous voyage hitherto, and de&s;iring them to en&s;ure his &s;hip and cargo homeward bound; after which he applied him&s;elf &s;o heartily to the loading his &s;hip, that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Thom&s;on, &s;he was full in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks. This kind gen|tleman likewi&s;e procured for Don Rodriguez, bills upon London for the greate&s;t part of his gold and &s;ilver, by which means it was &s;ecured again&s;t the ri&s;k of the &s;eas and the enemy; and before we &s;ailed, &s;upplied us with &s;uch large quantities of all kinds of &s;tock, that not only we, but the whole &s;hips company, fared &s;umptu|ou&s;ly during the voyage.</P>
<P>Every thing being ready, we took our leave of our kind entertainers, and going on board at Port Royal, &s;et &s;ail for England on the fir&s;t day of June.&mdash;We beat up to windward, with fine ea&s;y weather; and one night, believing our&s;elves near Cape Tiberoon, lay to, with an intention to wood and water next morning in the bay: While we remained in this &s;ituation, a &s;ailor hav|ing drank more new rum than he could carry, &s;taggered over-board, and notwith&s;tanding all the means that could be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve him, went to the bottom and di&s;appeared.

after this melancholy accident happened, as I en|joyed a cool air on the quarter-deck, I heard a voice ri&s;ing, as it were, out of the &s;ea, and cal|ling, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ho, the &s;hip, a hoy!"</Q> Upon which one of the men upon the foreca&s;tle cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll be d&mdash;n'd, if that an't Jack Marlin&s;pike, who went over-board!"</Q> Not a little &s;ur|prized at this event, I jumped into the boat that lay along-&s;ide, with the &s;econd mate and four men, and rowing towards the place, from whence the voice (which repeated the hail) &s;eemed to proceed, we perceived &s;omething floating upon the water; when we had rowed a little farther, we di&s;cerned it to be a man riding upon a hen|coop, who &s;eeing us approach, pronounced with a hoar&s;e voice, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"D&mdash;n your bloods! why did you not an&s;wer when I hailed?"</Q> Our mate, who was a veritable &s;eaman, hearing this &s;alute, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By G&mdash;d, my lads, this is none of our man&mdash;This is the devil&mdash;pull away for the &s;hip."</Q> The fellows obeyed his command, without que&s;tion, and were already &s;ome fathoms on our return, when I in&s;i&s;ted on their taking up the poor creature, and prevailed upon them to go back to the wreck, which when we came near the &s;econd time, and &s;ignified our intention, we received an an&s;wer of, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ava&s;t, ava&s;t&mdash;what &s;hip, brother?"</Q> Being &s;atisfied in this par|ticular, he cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"D&mdash;n the &s;hip, I was in hopes it had been my own&mdash;where are you bound?"</Q> We gratified his curio&s;ity in this too; upon which he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be taken on board, and after being comforted with a dram, told us, he belonged to the Ve&s;uvio man of war, upon a cruize off the i&s;land of Hi&s;pa|niola;

that he had fallen over-board about four and twenty hours ago, and the &s;hip being under &s;ail, they did not chu&s;e to bring to, but to&s;&s;ed a hen-coop over-board for his convenience, upon which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning; how&s;omever, he was as well content to be aboard us, becau&s;e he did not doubt that we &s;hould meet his &s;hip; and if he had gone a&s;hore in the bay, he might have been taken pri&s;oner by the French.&mdash;My uncle and father were very much diverted with the account of this fellow's unconcerned behaviour; and in two days, meeting with the Ve&s;uvio, as he expected, he was &s;ent him on board of her according to his de&s;ire.</P>

<P>Fired with all the eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, I took po&s;t that very night, and in the morning reached an inn, about three miles from the Squire's ha|bitation; here I remained till next evening, al|laying the torture of my impatience with the rapturous hope of &s;eeing that divine creature, after an ab&s;ence of eighteen months, which &s;o far from impairing, had rai&s;ed my love to the mo&s;t exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections free from apprehen&s;ion, that &s;ometimes intervened in &s;pite of all my hope, and repre&s;ented her as having yielded to the importunity of her brother, and ble&s;&s;ed the arms of an unhappy rival.&mdash;My thoughts were even maddened with the fear of her death; and when I arrived in the dark at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for &s;ome time courage to de&s;ire admittance, le&s;t my &s;oul &s;hould be &s;hocked with di&s;mal tidings.

I thanked her for her kind concern, and as briefly as po&s;&s;ible de&s;cribed my flouri&s;hing &s;ituation, which afforded this humane per&s;on infinite wonder and &s;atisfaction.

Finding her immoveable on this &s;ubject, I in&s;i&s;ted on her accepting a pre&s;ent of thirty guineas, and took my leave, re&s;olving to accommodate her with the &s;ame &s;um annually,

<P>Having rode all night, I found my&s;elf at Can|terbury in the morning, where I alighted to pro|cure fre&s;h hor&s;es; and as I walked into the inn, perceived an apothecary's &s;hop on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, with the name of Morgan over the door: Alarm'd at this di&s;covery, I could not help thinking that my old me&s;s-mate had &s;ettled in this place; and upon enquiry, found my conjecture true, and that he was married lately to a widow of that city, by whom he had got three thou|&s;and pounds. Rejoiced at this intelligence, I went to his &s;hop as &s;oon as it was open, and found my friend behind the counter, bu&s;y in preparing a gly&s;ter. I &s;aluted him at entrance, with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your &s;ervant, Mr. Morgan."&mdash;</Q>Upon which he looked at me, and replying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, goot Sir;"</Q>rubbed his ingredients in the mortar, without any emotion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What! (&s;aid I) Morgan, have you forgot your old me&s;s-mate?"</Q> At the&s;e words, he looked up again, and &s;tarting, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As Got is my&mdash;&s;ure it cannot&mdash;yes by my &s;alfation, I pelieve it is my tear frient Mr. Rantom."&mdash;</Q>He was no &s;ooner convinced of my identity, than he threw down the pe&s;tle, over&s;et the mortar, and jumping over the board, &s;wept up the con|tents with his cloaths, flew about my neck, hugged me affectionately, and daubed me all over with turpentine and the yolks of eggs, which he had been mixing when I came in.&mdash;Our mutual congratulations being over, he told me, that he found him&s;elf a widower upon his return from the We&s;t Indies; that he had got intere&s;t

to be appointed &s;urgeon of a man of war, in which capacity he had &s;erved &s;ome years, until he married an apothecary's widow, with whom he now enjoyed a pretty good &s;um of money, peace and quiet, and an indifferent good trade.&mdash;He was very de&s;irous of hearing my adventures, which I a&s;&s;ured him I had not time to relate, but told him in general, my circum&s;tances were very good, and that I hoped to &s;ee him when I &s;hould not be in &s;uch a hurry as at pre&s;ent.&mdash;He in&s;i&s;ted however on my &s;taying breakfa&s;t, and introduced me to his wife, who &s;eemed to be a decent &s;en|&s;ible woman, pretty well &s;tricken in years. In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, he &s;hewed the &s;leeve-buttons I had exchanged with him at our parting in the We&s;t Indies, and was not a little proud to &s;ee that I had pre&s;erved his with the &s;ame care.

She approved of my conduct, and after having yielded to the &s;ugge&s;tions of her own friend&s;hip, in a&s;king if my voyage had been &s;ucce&s;sful, charged her&s;elf with that office, and left me glowing with de&s;ire of &s;eeing and embracing the object of my love. In a very little time I heard &s;ome body coming down &s;tairs in ha&s;te, and the voice of my angel pronounce, with an eager tone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O heaven! is it po&s;&s;ible! where is he?"</Q> How were my faculties arrou&s;ed at this well-known &s;ound! and how was

<P>As my fir&s;t tran&s;port abated, my pa&s;&s;ion grew turbulent and unruly.

She was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed at the circum&s;tances of my finding my father, which brought tears into her lovely eyes. She was tran&s;ported at hear|ing that he approved my flame, di&s;covered a longing de&s;ire of being introduced to him, con|gratulated her&s;elf and me upon my good fortune, and ob&s;erved that this great and unexpected &s;troke of fate &s;eemed to have been brought about by the immediate direction of providence.&mdash;Having en|tertained our&s;elves &s;ome hours with the genuine effu&s;ions of our &s;ouls, I obtained her con&s;ent to compleat my happine&s;s as &s;oon as my father &s;hould judge it proper; and applying with my own hands a valuable necklace, compo&s;ed of diamonds and amethy&s;ts &s;et alternately, which an old Spa|ni&s;h lady at Paraguay pre&s;ented me with, I took my leave, promi&s;ing to return in the afternoon with Don Rodriguez.&mdash;When I went home, this generous parent enquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narci&s;&s;a, to whom that

I might be the more agreeable, he put into my hand a deed, by which I found my&s;elf in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of fifteen thou&s;and pounds, exclu&s;ive of the profits of my own merchandize, which a|mounted to three thou&s;and more.&mdash;After dinner I accompanied him to the lodging of my mi&s;tre&s;s, who being dre&s;&s;ed for the occa&s;ion, made a mo&s;t dazzling appearance. I could perceive him &s;truck with her figure, which I really think was the mo&s;t beautiful that ever was created under the &s;un. He embraced her tenderly, and told her, he was proud of having a &s;on who had &s;pirit to attempt, and qualifications to engage, the affecti|ons of &s;uch a fine lady.&mdash;She blu&s;hed at this com|pliment, and with eyes full of the &s;ofte&s;t langui&s;h|ment turned upon me, &s;aid, &s;he would have been unworthy of Mr. Random's attention, had &s;he been blind to his extraordinary merit.&mdash;I made no other an&s;wer than a low bow.

Accordingly, I gave my friend an op|portunity of being alone with me, when, as I expected, he told me that he was ju&s;t on the point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle, who&s;e heir he was, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expence, which he de&s;ired I would lend him, and take his bond for the whole.

My father was not much &s;urpri&s;ed at this polite letter, after having heard the character of the author: and as for me, I was even plea&s;ed at his refu&s;al, becau&s;e I now had an opportunity of &s;hewing my di&s;intere&s;ted love. By his permi&s;|&s;ion I waited on my charmer; and having im|parted the contents of her brother's letter, at which &s;he wept bitterly, in &s;pite of all my con|&s;olation and care&s;&s;es, the time of our marriage was fixed at the di&s;tance of two days.&mdash;During this interval, in which my &s;oul was wound up to the la&s;t &s;tretch of rapturous expectation, Nar|ci&s;&s;a endeavoured to reconcile &s;ome of her rela|tions in town to her marriage with me; but find|ing them all deaf to her remon&s;trances, either out of envy or prejudice; &s;he told me with the mo&s;t enchanting &s;weetne&s;s, while the tears bedewed her lovely cheeks, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sure the world will no longer que&s;tion your genero&s;ity, when you take a poor forlorn beggar to your arms."</Q> Affected with her &s;orrow, I pre&s;&s;ed the fair mourner to my brea&s;t, and &s;wore that &s;he was more dear and welcome on that account, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;acri|ficed her friends and fortune to her love for me.&mdash;My uncle, for who&s;e character &s;he had a great veneration, being by this time come to town, I introduced him to my bride; and although he was not very much &s;ubject to refined &s;en&s;ations, he was &s;truck dumb with admiration at her beauty.

&s;urpriz'd to hear my man &s;peak Latin, but when my father led Narci&s;&s;a into the room, the object of their admiration was &s;oon changed, as appear'd in the countenances of both.&mdash;Indeed they mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of all beings, could they have beheld without emotion the divine creature that approached! She was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ack of white &s;attin, embroidered on the brea&s;t with gold; the crown of her head was covered with a &s;mall French cap, from whence de&s;cended her beautiful hair in ringlets that waved upon her &s;nowy neck, which dignified the necklace I had given her; her looks glowed with mode&s;ty and love; and her bo&s;om, thro' the veil of gauze that &s;haded it, afforded a pro&s;pect of Elyzium!&mdash;I re|ceived this ine&s;timable gift of providence as be|came me; and in a little time the clergyman did his office, my uncle, at his own earne&s;t reque&s;t, acting the part of a father to my dear Narci&s;&s;a, who trembled very much, and had &s;carce &s;pirits &s;ufficient to &s;upport her under this great change of &s;ituation.&mdash;Soon as &s;he was mine by the laws of heaven and earth, I printed a burning ki&s;s upon her lips, my father embraced her tenderly, my uncle hugged her with great affection, and I pre|&s;ented her to my friend Banter, who &s;aluted her in a very polite manner; Mi&s;s Williams hung round her neck, and wept plentifully; while Strap fell upon his knees, and begged to ki&s;s his lady's hand, which &s;he pre&s;ented with great affability.&mdash;I &s;hall not pretend to de&s;cribe my own feelings at this juncture; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that after having &s;upped and entertained our&s;elves 'till ten a-clock, I cautioned my Narci&s;&s;a again&s;t expo|&s;ing her health by &s;itting up too late, and &s;he

When &s;he left the room, her face was over&s;pread with a blu&s;h that &s;et all my blood in a &s;tate of fermenta|tion, and made every pul&s;e beat with tenfold vigour! She was &s;o cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half hour; when, no longer able to re&s;train my impatience, I broke from the company, bur&s;t into her chamber, pu&s;hed out her confidante, locked the door, and found her&mdash;O heav'n and earth! a fea&s;t, a thou&s;and times more delicious than my mo&s;t &s;anguine hope pre&s;aged!&mdash;But let me not profane the cha&s;te my&s;teries of hymen&mdash;I was the happie&s;t of men!</P>

<P>My father intends to revi&s;it the place of his nativity&mdash;we propo&s;e to accompany him&mdash;my uncle renews his will in my favour, de|termining to go to &s;ea again&mdash;we &s;et out for Scotland&mdash;arrive at Edinburgh&mdash;purcha&s;e our paternal e&s;tate&mdash;proceed to to it&mdash;halt at the town where I was educated&mdash;take up my bond to Crab&mdash;the behaviour of Potion and his wife, and one of my female cou&s;ins&mdash;our reception at the e&s;tate&mdash;Strap marries Mi&s;s Wil|liams, and is &s;ettled by my father to his own &s;atisfaction&mdash;I am more and more happy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY father intending to revi&s;it his native coun|try, and pay the tribute of a few tears at my mother's grave, Narci&s;&s;a and I re&s;olved to accompany him in the execution of this pious office, and accordingly prepared for the journey; in which, however, my uncle would not engage, being re&s;olved to try his fortune once more at &s;ea. In the mean time, he renewed his will in favour of my wife and me, and depo&s;ited it in the hands of his brother-in-law: While I (that I might not be wanting to my own intere&s;t) &s;ummoned the Squire to produce his father's will
<PB N="361" REF="375">
at Doctor's Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Every thing being thus &s;ettled, we took leave of all our friends in London, and &s;et out for Scotland, Don Rodriguez, Narci&s;&s;a, Mi&s;s Williams, and I in the coach, and Strap with two men in livery on hor&s;e-back: As we made ea&s;y &s;tages, my charmer held it out very well, till we arrived at Edinburgh, where we propo&s;ed to re&s;t our&s;elves &s;ome weeks. People of our fi|gure could not fail of attracting the notice of &s;uch a &s;mall place, where, as &s;oon as our family was known, we were loaded with care&s;&s;es, and Nar|ci&s;&s;a was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the civilities &s;he received, that &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he would never de&s;ire to live in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>Here Don Rodriguez having intelligence that his nephew the fox-hunter had &s;pent his e&s;tate, which was to be expo&s;ed to &s;ale by publick auc|tion, he determined to make a purcha&s;e of the &s;pot where he was born, and actually bought the whole of his father's lands.</P>
<P>In a few days after this bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and by the way, halted one night in that town where I was educated.&mdash;Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead; whereupon I &s;ent for his executor, paid the &s;um I owed, with intere&s;t, and took up my bond. Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival, had the a&s;&s;urance to come to the inn where we lodged, and &s;end up their names, with a de&s;ire of being permitted to pay their re&s;pects to my father and me: But their fordid behaviour towards me, when I was an orphan, had made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion on
<PB N="362" REF="376">
my mind, to be effaced by this mean mercena|ry piece of conde&s;cen&s;ion; I therefore rejected their me&s;&s;age with di&s;dain, and bid Strap tell them, that my father and I de&s;ired to have no commu|nication with &s;uch low-minded wretches as they were.</P>
<P>They had not been gone half an hour, when a woman without any ceremony, opened the door of the room where we &s;at, and making towards my father, acco&s;ted him with, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Uncle, your &s;ervant&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee you."&mdash;</Q>This was no other than one of my female cou&s;ins, men|tioned in the fir&s;t part of my memoirs, to whom Don Rodriguez replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pray, who are you, madam?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O! (cried &s;he) my cou&s;in Rory there, knows me very well&mdash;Don't you remember me, Rory?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, madam, (&s;aid I) for my own part, I &s;hall ne|ver forget you.&mdash;Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I have formerly told you) treated me &s;o humanely in my childhood!"</Q> When I pronounced the&s;e words, my father's re|&s;entment glowed in his vi&s;age, and he ordered her to be gone, with &s;uch a commanding a&s;pect, that &s;he retired in a fright, muttering cur&s;es as &s;he went down &s;tairs: We afterwards learned that &s;he was married to an en&s;ign, who had al|ready &s;pent all her fortune; and that her &s;i&s;ter had bore a child to her mother's footman, who is now her hu&s;band, and keeps a petty ale-hou&s;e in the country.</P>
<P>The fame of our flouri&s;hing condition having arrived at this place before us, we got notice that the magi&s;trates intended next day to com|pliment us with the freedom of their town;
<PB N="363" REF="377">
upon which my father, con&s;idering their com|plai&s;ance in the right point of view, ordered the hor&s;es to the coach early in the morning, when we proceeded to our e&s;tate, which lay about a dozen miles from this place.</P>
<P>When we came within half a league of the hou&s;e, we were met by a prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women and children, who te&s;tified their joy by loud acclamations, and ac|companied our coach to the gate.&mdash;As there is no part of the world, in which the pea&s;ants are more attached to their Lords, than in Scotland, we were almo&s;t devoured by their affection, in getting out of the coach: My father had always been their favourite, and now that he appeared their ma&s;ter, after being thought dead &s;o long, their joy broke out into a thou&s;and extra|vagancies: When we got into the court-yard, we were &s;urrounded by a va&s;t number, who crowded together &s;o clo&s;ely to &s;ee us, that &s;everal were in danger of being &s;queezed to death; tho&s;e who were near Don Rodriguez fell upon their knees, and ki&s;&s;ed his hand, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hem of his garment, praying aloud for long life and pro&s;perity to him; others approached Narci&s;&s;a and me in the &s;ame manner; while the re&s;t clapped their hands at a di&s;tance, and invoked heaven to &s;hower its choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on our heads!&mdash;In &s;hort, the whole &s;cene, though rude, was &s;o affecting, that the gentle partner of my heart wept over it, and my father him&s;elf could not refrain from dropping a tear.</P>
<P>Having welcomed his daughter and me to his hou&s;e, he ordered &s;ome bullocks to be killed, and &s;ome hog&s;heads of ale to be brought from
<PB N="364" REF="378">
the neighbouring village, to regale tho&s;e hone&s;t people, who had not enjoyed &s;uch a holiday for many years before.</P>
<P>Next day we were vi&s;ited by the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, mo&s;t of them our relations, one of whom brought along with him my cou&s;in, the fox-hunter, who had &s;taid at his hou&s;e, &s;ince he was obliged to leave his own: My father was generous enough to receive him kindly, and even promi&s;e to purcha&s;e for him a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, at which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed great thankfulne&s;s and joy:</P>
<P>My charming Narci&s;&s;a was univer&s;ally admired and loved for her beauty, affability and good &s;en&s;e; and &s;o well plea&s;ed with the &s;ituation of the place, and the company around, that &s;he has not, as yet, di&s;covered the lea&s;t de&s;ire of changing her habitation.</P>
<P>We had not been many days &s;ettled, when I prevailed upon my father to pay a vi&s;it to the village where I had been at &s;chool. Here we were received by the principal inhabitants, who entertained us in the church, where Mr. Syntax the &s;choolma&s;ter (my tyrant being dead) pro|nounced a Latin &s;peech in honour of our family: And none exerted them&s;elves more than Strap's father and relations, who looked upon the hone&s;t valet as the fir&s;t gentleman of their race, and ho|noured his benefactors accordingly.&mdash;Having re|ceived the homage of this place, we retired, leav|ing forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the pari&s;h; and that very night, Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been &s;hewn to him, and to me on his account, ven|tured to tell me, that he had a &s;neaking kind|ne&s;s

for Mi&s;s Williams, and that if his lady and I would u&s;e our intere&s;t in his behalf, he did not doubt that &s;he would li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es. Surprized at this propo&s;al, I a&s;ked if he knew the &s;tory of that unfortunate young gentlewoman: Upon which, he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, yes, I know what you mean&mdash;&s;he has been unhappy, I grant you&mdash;but what of that? I am convinced of her reformation; or el&s;e you and my good lady would not treat her with &s;uch re&s;pect.&mdash;As for the cen&s;ure of the world, I value it not a fig's end&mdash;be&s;ides, the world knows nothing of the matter."</Q> I commended his philo&s;ophy, and intere&s;ted Narci&s;&s;a in his cau&s;e; who interceded &s;o effectually, that in a little time, Mi&s;s Williams, yielded her con&s;ent, and they were married with the approbation of Don Rodriguez, who gave him five hundred pounds to &s;tock a farm, and made him over&s;eer of his e&s;tate. My generous bedfellow gave her maid the &s;ame &s;um; &s;o that they live in great peace and plenty within half a mile of us, and daily put up prayers for our pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>If there be &s;uch a thing as true happine&s;s on earth, I enjoy it.&mdash;The impetuous tran&s;ports of my pa&s;&s;ion are now &s;ettled and mellowed into endearing fondne&s;s and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate connexion and inter|change of hearts, which nought but virtuous wedlock can produce.&mdash;Fortune &s;eems deter|mined to make ample amends for her for|mer cruelty; for my proctor writes, that not|with&s;tanding the clau&s;e in my father-in-law's will, on which the Squire founds his claim, I &s;hall certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">over my wife's fortune, in con&s;e|quence

of a codicil annexed, which explains that clau&s;e, and limits her re&s;triction to the age of nineteen, after which &s;he was at her own di&s;|po&s;al.&mdash;I would have &s;et out for London immedi|ately after receiving this piece of intelligence, but my dear angel has been qualmi&s;h of late, and begins to grow remarkably round in the wai&s;t; &s;o that I cannot leave her in &s;uch an intere&s;ting &s;ituation, which I hope will produce &s;omething to crown my felicity.</P>
