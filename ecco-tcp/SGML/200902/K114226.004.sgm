<HEAD>THE HISTORY of BENIGNUS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="68" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I THOUGHT Mr. Draper the true &s;tandard for imitation, and re&s;olv|ed to copy his manner; but, for the blood of me, I could not hit him off. The air of his walk was my fir&s;t ob|ject; there was &s;ometimes a trip, &s;ome|times a &s;wagger, and &s;ometimes a kind
<PB N="2" REF="9">of care-for-nothing &s;aunter in his mo|tions, that in him were becoming; but at &s;econd-hand exhibited a drollery truly laughable: the trip had well nigh tilted me upon my no&s;e; the &s;wagger made me &s;trike the arm of a lady, to the great injury of her ruffle, for which I had like to have been rewarded with a broken head, by a gentleman who, for ought I know, might be her hu&s;|band; and, in trying to catch the &s;aun|ter, I only &s;ucceeded in the care-for|nothing part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which conducted me into a kennel, that conveniently ran by the &s;ide of the pavement, from which I had deviat|ed. This un&s;ucce&s;sful mimicry gave &s;uch plea&s;ure to the <HI>mo&s;t poli&s;hed cha|racter of the age,</HI> that he very plenti|fully wept with laughter, and, when I
<PB N="3" REF="10">was making the effort to &s;wing my cane with a &s;uitable carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, (by which I chuck'd it again&s;t the chin of a chairman, who damn'd me for a &s;aucy ra&s;cal, and ran away with my proper|ty;) it was too much to bear, and he &s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t a door-po&s;t, from dropping down dead in the &s;treet a victim to ri&s;ibility. Piqued a little at this, I propos'd phlebotomy, and offered to &s;end for a &s;urgeon, but Draper perceiving a crowd beginning to clu&s;ter (for it is incredible how few moments are nece&s;&s;ary to collect a mob in London) he got the better of his convul&s;ion, and a&s;king my par|don, walk forward: I forgave him in expre&s;&s;ion, but the in&s;ult and the inho&s;pitality &s;unk deep into my heart,
<PB N="4" REF="11">and whether it was benevolent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or not, I wi&s;hed for nothing half &s;o much as an occa&s;ion of revenge: and this, I think, was the &s;econd in&s;tance I detected in my&s;elf a propen&s;ity to recriminate. It will, however, he con&s;idered that I was now launched into the world; my village-notions were wearing off; town maxims were &s;ucceeding; and I am much afraid we &s;hall always be found to lo&s;e our amiable &s;implicity, in proportion as we engage our&s;elves in active &s;cenes, and procure that &s;ort of knowledge which ari&s;es from &s;uch engagements.</P>
<P>At all events, however, I was re|&s;olved to decline all imitations for the future, and &s;tick to the original, un|couth as it might be. Better, thought I, to be naturally clowni&s;h, than af|fectedly
<PB N="5" REF="12">ridiculous; and perhaps this <HI>well-bred</HI> town will &s;oon give me as delicate a poli&s;h as the be&s;t of them. Draper, it is mo&s;t likely, &s;aw my chagrin, and with a flippancy pecu|liar to him&s;elf, rallied me upon it. Oh thou &s;impleton! cried he, in a world like this, to &s;acrifice a &s;ingle moment to the &s;pleen; but, above all things, to let an harmle&s;s piece of jo|cularity make thee grave. To laugh, Mr. Draper, &s;aid I, you know is ex|qui&s;ite; but to be the &s;ubject of de|ri&s;ion, is the agony of the damned. P&s;haw, an&s;wered Draper, not among&s;t friends. He who furni&s;hes the mo&s;t amu&s;ement, is the mo&s;t agreeable companion; and to &s;hew you that I really think &s;o, I charge you to have as much laugh out of me, as you
<PB N="6" REF="13">po&s;&s;ibly can; and before half the day is over, a precious mor&s;el you'll find me, I promi&s;e you. Look, if Tom Spangle is not cro&s;&s;ing the way &mdash;the fine&s;t lad in the univer&s;e, Be|nignus: you mu&s;t know him; I'll in|troduce you directly. With this Mr. Draper &s;kipped over the &s;treet, with the heel of a Mercury, caring &s;ix pence neither for the &s;oul or body of the poor devil whom he left to &s;camper after him: and nice, indeed, even to the verge of a miracle, was my e&s;cape; for in attempting to be at the oppo&s;ite pavement as &s;oon as he, I was hemmed, in the very middle of the &s;treet, by a pre&s;s of coaches on the one hand, and a dreadful length of drays on the other, while the cla&s;h of wheels, the thunder of oaths, and
<PB N="7" REF="14">the &s;mack of whips, re&s;ounded on all &s;ides: at length, however, I got &s;afe to Mr. Draper, to whom I would not complain of my terrors, and he in|&s;tantly put my hand into the &s;oft, and white palm, of Mr. Tom Spangle.</P>
<P>Never were the exteriors of two people more exactly contra&s;ted than the exteriors of Draper and Spangle, the latter being the &s;leeke&s;t, &s;limme&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;hivering little creature, that ever "&s;huddered at a breeze." The chin was as &s;mooth as the lips of a lady, and the limbs as un&s;ub&s;tan|tially delicate as tho&s;e which belong to the greyhounds of Italy, and the tender proprietor of this per&s;on was ju&s;t &s;tepping into a milliner's &s;hop, to recruit him&s;elf with Hungary water. We &s;topped him at the door, and I
<PB N="8" REF="15">&s;hall give the reader, with all po&s;&s;ible regard to truth, an ab&s;tract of the conver&s;ation which now pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Mr. Draper and his friend. And &s;o, you would not come among&s;t us ye&s;terday, &s;ays Spangle; you lo&s;t much of your dearly beloved <HI>laugh,</HI> I can tell you that; we had &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t &s;port in nature: rather fa|tiguing, indeed, but the variety ren|dered it enchanting. Aye, indeed, replied Draper, how did you go on? This is no place, child, an&s;wered Spangle, to enter into the agreeable particulars; the next door is a coffee|room, you &s;ee.&mdash;They went into the coffee-hou&s;e, &s;eated them&s;elves with|out ceremony, placed me in the middle, and thus Mr. Spangle, with|out any re&s;pect to the company in
<PB N="9" REF="16">the room, continued his narrative: Now, Draper, I mu&s;t tell you, that it was a complete day of rattle and ex|ta&s;y, and if my nerves had not been mon&s;trou&s;ly in tune, I mu&s;t have ab&s;olutely expired of an exce&s;s of bli&s;s: never &s;pent &s;o exqui&s;ite a day in my life, and a <HI>fa&s;t day</HI> into the bargain!&mdash;Such a put of a par&s;on; but the organ made us amends; for we all went to the chapel, becau&s;e <HI>you know who</HI> always &s;its in the pew facing the pulpit. What a pret|ty puritan it is! Lord Dazzle drew her eyes from the prayer-book more than once. Lovebook thought to at|tract her by his voice, and &s;o read the P&s;alms louder than the clark; &s;ir Charles Crazy <HI>focu&s;s'd</HI> her through an opera-gla&s;s; but, Je&s;us! George, what
<PB N="10" REF="17">are all the tricks of arts, to the charms of nature!&mdash;<HI>I</HI> was only in&mdash;a mere undre&s;s&mdash;and made a conque&s;t in half an hour. Really, cried Draper, with a very grave face! True, on my ve|racity, an&s;wered Spangle: about the middle of the Litany I made an im|pre&s;&s;ion; the Epi&s;tle and Go&s;pel &s;et her a trembling; the &s;econd le&s;&s;on (that, you know, comes next) was &s;omething about Peter or Paul, (I forgot which) marrying and burning; and this, as I fixed my eyes upon her, threw her into a cele&s;tial confu&s;ion, as much as to &s;ay, that Spangle is a divine fellow!&mdash;at the end of the Communion, &s;he cried out with great fervour, Lord have mercy upon us! and before Orthodox had half done his ditty, which was all about the
<PB N="11" REF="18">obligations to charity &mdash; you know what a Jew he is&mdash;the &s;melling bottle was at her no&s;e, and in five minutes afterwards, as I now pur&s;ued my ad|vantages, her face turned quite red; and, to my eternal honour, and then immortal triumph, I drove her fairly out of church. The congregation ro&s;e to &s;tare, the girl held down her head, as if &s;he had been doing pe|nance in a white &s;heet, tottered through the aile, as if &s;he would &s;ink upon one of the old &s;tone tombs, and &s;ome of the people, methought, look|ed at me, as they would &s;ay, Yes, yes, Mr. Spangle&mdash;it's all over with her.&mdash;She's breeding, I &s;uppo&s;e, for all her piety!</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, and hummed an air. And do you think, &s;ir, &s;aid I to
<PB N="12" REF="19">Spangle, there was any thing &s;o &s;u|perlatively plea&s;urable in &s;ending a young woman from divine &s;ervice, by dint of &s;tare? Plea&s;urable! echoed Spangle; Why, &s;ir, &s;he's <HI>mode&s;t.</HI> Does that make it more honourable in you, to look that mode&s;ty out of coun|tenance?&mdash;Certainly, &s;aid he: to tri|umph over a girl who goes to church four times a week, who pretends to &s;uch a cur&s;ed deal of devotion, and has always a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;be&s;ides, &s;he's <HI>un|comeatable.</HI> How do you know that? &s;ays Draper. Why, an&s;wers Spangle, as &s;oon as old Orthodox had mum|belled over his &s;ermon, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed us with the "Peace of God," I gave my party the &s;lip, and drove to Strawby's. Not to be got, though I offered a thou&s;and for her privy pur&s;e:
<PB N="13" REF="20">the jade wanted to fob me off with the fir&s;t ta&s;te of the mercer's wife, who is to meet colonel Sweeps this evening; the woman's hand&s;ome, and de&s;ireable, but Strawby has only been after her a fortnight&mdash;be&s;ides, &s;he's really married, and I dete&s;t adul|tery. 'Tis one of my crying &s;ins, you mu&s;t know, Draper. So then, you have no hopes of this religious lady, (cries Mr. Draper, who main|tained very &s;erious features during this di&s;cour&s;e.) Why yes, replied Spangle, upon the whole, I think I have, for Strawby is to &s;et all wheels to work. She is, it &s;eems, an only child, and &s;o is cur&s;edly clo&s;e attend|ed by her mother: luckily, the father is dead, and the girl looks divinely in mourning. Here I felt a tear up|on
<PB N="14" REF="21">my cheek, which was not, how|ever, detected by either of my com|panions; and the amiable Mr. Spangle went on in this manner.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="69" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Strawby, it &s;eems, knows a girl who keeps a young fellow, who is very intimate in the family, and who is be&s;ides in the good graces of the old woman, the mother: now the &s;cheme is, to get this girl, to get this man, to get this woman. As how, &s;aid Draper.&mdash;My blood ran cold through my veins, and my heart lay freezing at my brea&s;t.&mdash;As how? re|plied Draper. Why, this kept man, you may be &s;ure, rejoined Spangle,
<PB N="15" REF="22">wants ca&s;h. I will meet him at Straw|by's (who will invite him), as if by accident; then I will take &s;uch a liking to him, as to be afterwards often in his company. After this we will go to the church, where Mi&s;s Dian Dick&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I was going to tell her name; but as this gentleman, (pointing to me,) is a &s;tranger, and as it is an affair of honour, he will ex|cu&s;e me: &s;o as I was &s;aying, I will pretend to be deeply &s;mitten, and talk about laying fortune and per&s;on at her feet. This induces the fellow, (by this time my fa&s;t friend,) to po&s;t away to the mother's hou&s;e, which you know is at the bottom of St. James's &s;treet.&mdash;Pi&s;h, cur&s;e my blun|dering head&mdash;but her <HI>name</HI> is &s;acred. I &s;hall then &s;oon pay a vi&s;it in form&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="23">then come to your call-in as-it hap|pens&mdash;then to your how-do-you fa|miliars&mdash;then alarm the girl into a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;tattle about &s;ettlements&mdash; bring a <HI>proper</HI> attorney with parch|ments&mdash;&s;cheme a &s;hort delay&mdash;indulge endearment&mdash;&s;et out together for an airing&mdash;drive about till it is du&s;k, and &s;o then to Strawby's&mdash;(here he &s;napped his fingers, in a kind of vic|torious flouri&s;h over his head)&mdash;I &s;tart|ed up, and exclaimed, in a &s;tern voice. And what then, &s;ir?&mdash;Why then, &s;ir, replied Spangle, cooly, we may po&s;&s;ibly take our chocolate in bed the next morning, and the night afterwards &s;he will be very much at your &s;ervice. What, don't you intend to make her your wife then, &s;ir? &s;aid I. Make her my wife? replied the
<PB N="17" REF="24">beau, in a faint, frighted voice&mdash; Would you have me run my neck into another halter? Then you are already e&s;pou&s;ed! To the fine&s;t wo|man in the three kingdoms, and as much above this dingy Diana, as Cleo|patra was to that old crooked crump of a thing in the bar&mdash;uttering the compari&s;on loud enough for a woman unhappily deformed to hear him, as &s;he was pur&s;uing her bu&s;ine&s;s. Mr. Draper, &s;aid I, if you'll favour me with direction to this Taylor, I will go and find him out; for in the company of a man who flies openly in the face of his God, and rejoices in the fall of beauty and innocence, I can really &s;tay no longer. The pale creamy face of Mr. Spangle, immediately &s;hifted to a more &s;anguine hue, and he pertly
<PB N="18" REF="25">&s;aid, he did nothing which made him a&s;hamed to face his God, and that if I would walk into a more private apartment, he would convince me that he was not afraid to face a <HI>man;</HI> looking at the &s;ame time at me, from head to foot, as if he thought me a boy. And now came on Mr. Dra|per's laughing time, for &s;ometimes he &s;oothed, &s;ometimes encouraged, &s;ometimes provoked both; yet ap|peared all along the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and zealous friend of both: I told him that I had nobler rea&s;ons than any proceeding from fear, for declining to di&s;pute with him. If you &s;hould change your mind, &s;ir, replied Spangle, taking a piece of paper from his pocket-book, and penciling his name upon it&mdash;I am always found
<PB N="19" REF="26"><HI>there,</HI> &s;ir, to&s;&s;ing the addre&s;s to me with an air of di&s;dain, and offering to go out. Nay, nay, fy, gentlemen, cried Draper, interpo&s;ing: don't be grave about trifles, let me put your hands together: to be &s;ure, you have both &s;aid a word too much, and &s;ome people would have a meeting upon it: but, hang it, the girl is not worth duelling for; at lea&s;t, drop it for the pre&s;ent, and let us have a friendly cup of coffee together.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, George, &s;ays the beau, walking away in a flurry: I mu&s;t not have my morals di&s;puted with impu|nity. Sir, you will hear from me &s;hortly. So &s;aying, he threw down &s;ix pence on the board, to&s;&s;ed him&s;elf into a &s;edan, twitched the curtains round on all &s;ides, and was bobbed
<PB N="20" REF="27">off, before he had fini&s;hed the &s;tory of felicity, and his adventures on a day devoted to fa&s;ting and prayer. As &s;oon as he was gone, Draper, who had been upon the whole un|u&s;ually &s;erious, now gave way to the fun of his temper, and di&s;covered at once his own character, and that of Spangle, in a &s;tyle equally ludicrous, and licentious. That fellow, &s;ir, &s;ays he, is the &s;trange&s;t mortal upon the face of the earth: three or four years ago, he was as jolly and hearty a looking man as my&s;elf; but his pa&s;|&s;ion for women has made him what you &s;ee. Variety and difficulty equally di&s;tingui&s;h his amours: for he never &s;ees the &s;ame woman twice (except his wife, with whom he never &s;teeps); and if any of his objects are obtained
<PB N="21" REF="28">without great pains, and proportio|nate charge, he takes the fir&s;t oppor|tunity, after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not only to leave, but di&s;grace her! Can there, &s;aid I, po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uch a devil in the form of a man! Without an&s;wering me, Draper proceeded.</P>

<P>The reader, it is hoped, is by this time &s;ufficiently acquainted with me, to be certain I did not allow the mi|nute of his ab&s;ence to pa&s;s by, with|out pouring forth the reflections that the tran&s;actions of the morning had excited. What a pair of precious fel|lows, &s;aid I, are here: a &s;educer of the mode&s;t, and a receiver of the &s;educed.
<PB N="24" REF="31">One glorying becau&s;e his impudence drove a lady from her devotions, and the other in expectation of enjoying the benefit of the intrigue, &s;hould it be ultimately &s;ucce&s;sful! Then the dark plot laid again&s;t the virtue of this young lady&mdash;the la&s;t lovely prop of her widowed mother, now mourn|ing the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band. I &s;hudder at the danger which hovers over the relicts of this amiable hou&s;e&mdash;And yet how is the mi&s;chief&mdash;how is the impending mi&s;ery to be prevent|ed?</P>
<P>Chance frequently orders the mat|ter better, infinitely better, than con|trivance; perhaps, that very &s;troke which we call chance, is in reality the wi&s;dom of preter-natural direction; and in that ca&s;e the difference lies
<PB N="25" REF="32">only in the word, while the meaning is the &s;ame. As I was deliberating on the means by which poor Diana might be re&s;cued from di&s;honour, I put my hand into my pocket to take out my handkerchief, in doing which I dropped one of my gloves, and, in &s;tooping to take it up, I &s;aw a pocket|book lying under the table, which I found had accidentally been left by Spangle, when he gave me his ad|dre&s;s; and I was ju&s;t proceeding with it to the bar-keeper, with a proper charge to deliver it to the gentleman, &s;hould he enquire for it, when the return of Mr. Draper made me think it better to give it <HI>him,</HI> as a friend who might have an earlier opportu|nity of delivering it. Fortunately, however (as the reader will perceive
<PB N="26" REF="33">in the &s;equel), Draper had none of that trouble&s;ome punctilio about him, which would have deterred <HI>me</HI> from invading the &s;ecrets of this private repo&s;itory, on any con&s;ideration what|ever. Indeed, this gentleman had a &s;trange mixture of heterogeneous qua|lities in his character, the true colour of which was not to be a&s;certained at one &s;itting; and he painted him&s;elf in the end much livelier, and truer, than it was in the power of any other per&s;on to depict him. The moment he ca&s;t his eye on the pocket-book, he &s;eized it as a prize, and &s;wore it mu&s;t be one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities in the world. A pocket-book, Be|nignus, is the man of plea&s;ure's com|panion, or a polite directory to all places of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort; as ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="27" REF="34">to us, my dear boy, as our &s;hirts, and appropriated to nearly the &s;ame u&s;e, viz. to conceal &s;ecrets. As &s;oon as we have &s;een Skain, we will &s;aunter homewards through the Mall, and enjoy this delightful treat which Spangle has unintentionally afforded us. We now left the cof|fee-room, and as we walked along, I a&s;ked Draper if he thought it quite delicate to open the pocket-book. There you go, an&s;wered he; that damned <HI>delicacy</HI> has made all the young men and women mere blu&s;h|ing babies: our novels, plays, and conver&s;ations, are now conducted with &s;o much refinement; nay our very &s;ermons&mdash;I &s;hould &s;ay our moral e&s;&s;ays, are &s;o confounded <HI>delicate,</HI> that we are for ever talking about it,
<PB N="28" REF="35">and about it, without having the cou|rage to &s;peak out: and yet what is all this <HI>delicacy</HI> but circumlocutory licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s; hone&s;t matter of fact, dre&s;t in a veil of gau&s;e, the di&s;gui&s;e &s;een through with half an eye? Nay, it were no difficult point to prove that the ribaldry of Lord Roche&s;ter is infinitely le&s;s pernicious than the de|&s;cription of &s;cenes drawn by tho&s;e gen|try, who pique them&s;elves upon their <HI>fine feelings.</HI> Bawdry, Sir, candied over by <HI>&s;entiment,</HI> is &s;wallowed eagerly by the coye&s;t maiden in the world; but&mdash;oh rude wretch! She abominates the wri|ter, who &s;ays the &s;ame thing in a plain|er way. What would you infer from the&s;e remarks, Mr. Draper, &s;aid I&punc; I hate argument, my dear fellow, &s;aid Draper, and &s;o let us make the be&s;t of
<PB N="29" REF="36">our way to Skain's, and then I will give you an in&s;tance of my <HI>delicacy</HI> with re&s;pect to the pocket-book. A few mi|nutes &s;mart walking brought us to a &s;treet, where Draper pre&s;ently rapp'd at the door of a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, and enquired for Mr. Skain; and, upon being told he was at home, we were begged to walk for a moment into a parlour, till Mr. Skain could be called. This parlour, its furniture, and the look of the &s;ervant, be&s;poke &s;omething &s;o much beyond any idea I had con|ceived, of a taylor, that I made no &s;cru|ple of a&s;king Draper what apartments in &s;o fa&s;hionable a hou&s;e Skain could po&s;&s;ibly occupy. This was a &s;weet que&s;tion for the con&s;titution of my companion, who enjoyed once more, at my expence, the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure of
<PB N="30" REF="37">laughing; though, where the joke lies in laughing at a man's &s;eeming igno|rant of what he never had an oppor|tunity of knowing, I really cannot tell. In the mid&s;t of the merriment, in came a &s;omebody, in a green velvet cap, li|nen night-gown, laced wai&s;tcoat, fill &s;tockings, and Morocco flippers: Aye, Skain, how do you do? I have brought you a young cu&s;tomer, a man of fa|&s;hion, ju&s;t come to his e&s;tate: he is my mo&s;t particular friend, and you mu&s;t be with him to-morrow at Mrs. Darlington's, in Cavendi&s;h Square. I &s;hould as &s;oon have &s;u&s;pected Draper him&s;elf to have been a weilder of the goo&s;e and &s;ciffars, as this identical Mr. Skain, who li&s;tened to my friend's ha|rangue, without any thing approach|ing to that cringe and congee, &s;o inci|dental
<PB N="31" REF="38">to the character in the country. So far, however, was <HI>he</HI> from cring|ing, that he re&s;ted his bum again&s;t a table, with all the important lounge of a nobleman, played a &s;ort of tune with his &s;ingers upon the &s;ide of his gown, and &s;troaked his beard with the other hand, till Mr. Draper had fini&s;h|ed; after which, without once drop|ping his dignity, he began.</P>

I am highly proud of the Lo|nour, and &s;hall take a plea&s;ure in &s;erv|ing the gentleman; but you know our predicament: our cu&s;tomers are all in a hurry, and I am &s;o much in the <HI>death and marriage-way,</HI> that I can &s;carce call a moment my own for a mouthful of victuals. I am likewi&s;e at this in&s;tant equipping an heir for this world, and an old fellow for the other (who, by the bye ought to have died &s;even years ago), and the widow is as anxious to put on black, to tell her acquaintance &s;he is her own mi&s;|tre&s;s, as the heir to get out of his &s;a|bles,
<PB N="33" REF="40">and tell the women he is a match for any fortune among&s;t them. If the young gentleman could wait, there|fore, for a few days till&mdash;Lookee, Skain, an&s;wered Draper, I in&s;i&s;t on your being with my friend in the morning; he is ju&s;t from the country, and cannot go into public for want of proper cloaths. Well, Sir, replied Skain, in a more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive voice, if that is the ca&s;e, I will &s;it up with my men night and day, or throw &s;ome of the work in hand by&mdash;for one can make free with old cu&s;tomers&mdash;rather than di&s;tre&s;s a gentleman; and, indeed, I perceive &mdash; Here Mr. Skain lifted up my coat by the pocket flap&mdash;I per|ceive the gentleman has been in bad hands; he has been, as I often &s;ay, among the butchers of broad-cloth,
<PB N="34" REF="41">and ruiners of raiment:&mdash;In this face|tious &s;train was our gentleman-taylor proceeding, when the parlour-door opened, and enlarged our &s;ociety by the addition of a per&s;on who was an|nounced to be Mr. Thrift, the taylor's attorney, and who had babbled out his bu&s;ine&s;s, not much in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion, without any regard to &s;trangers, the moment he entered. To the credit of the trade, however, I mu&s;t confe&s;s this was one of the rotten limbs, and not one of the found mem|bers of the law; a dirty, dark, drudg|ing character, to whom no man of re|putation would intru&s;t his bu&s;ine&s;s, nor any but creatures like him&s;elf be|come clients. Well, friend Skain, we have nabbed him at la&s;t; Ma&s;ter Dudge is a mo&s;t indefatigable fellow; as &s;ure
<PB N="35" REF="42">of his prey as a kite. Ay, aye, he has him at la&s;t, locked up in Holborn: a fine pro&s;pect of a grated window be|fore him: &s;even writs after him&mdash;hea|vy charges, Mr. Skain! I don't care a farthing for that, (cries Skane in an ex|ta&s;y) as we have got him in limbo, my heart is ea&s;y, and I &s;hall re&s;t quiet in my bed. In limbo he <HI>is</HI> then, I pro|mi&s;e you, replied Thrift, and likely to remain there till an act; for I know &s;everal trade&s;men, be&s;ides you, who have bills again&s;t him, and I now think it my duty as an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man, to ac|quaint them, they may renew their writs, and lodge their detainers. To be &s;ure, replied Skain, to be &s;ure, it behoves every Chri&s;tian to &s;erve an|other in this ca&s;e, for the good of trade is concerned in the&s;e ca&s;es, and &s;uch
<PB N="36" REF="43">a fellow &s;hould be puni&s;hed as an ex|ample: he's a mere bite, Mr. Thrift&mdash; an arrant bilk; though he has an ad|dre&s;s, and I once thought him very much of a gentleman. And how came you &s;o &s;oon to change your mind, que&s;tioned Mr. Draper, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;it out all di&s;putes. Why, as &s;ure as I &s;tand here, Mr. Draper, I have taken pounds upon pounds of that man's money; and for &s;ome time he was as punctual as the pendulum: deliver a bill, and take your ca&s;h: nay, &s;ometimes he would in&s;i&s;t upon my writing a receipt in full, as &s;oon as the clothes were &s;ent home, and more than once I have been obliged to pre&s;s credit upon him, that he might not &s;uppo&s;e I was afraid to tru&s;t him: but for the&s;e two years I can't hear that he
<PB N="37" REF="44">has paid any body, and yet the fellow tricks out him&s;elf, and his wife, and his three children, as gay and gaudy as Mr. Anybody's family: my account alone runs pretty high, but I have his body for my goods, however! And I fear, cried Thrift, &s;hrugging up his &s;houlders, that is all you are ever like|ly to have; for I don't think the man has &s;ixpence to &s;ave his &s;oul: nay I am &s;ure he has not, for Mr. Dodge gave me &s;uch an excellent account of the manner by which he was nabb'd, that it is worth your hearing; for you mu&s;t know&mdash;Stop a moment, dear Mr. Thrift, till I ring for &s;ome chocolate: do, pray Mr. Draper, and you, Sir, &s;aid Skain, pre&s;&s;ing me to keep my &s;eat, &s;tay, I be&s;eech you, and hear the &s;tory; there's nothing in my idea &s;o
<PB N="38" REF="45">high as &s;cenes of low life. To this &s;peech Draper (who loved adventures to the bottom of his heart, and who &s;eldom interrupted people in the rela|tion of them till all was over) an&s;wer|ed only by a &s;light bow; and I &s;at too much amazed to talk, con&s;idering the whole &s;ociety as a collection of devils, and equally de&s;pi&s;ing the coolne&s;s of Draper, the malignity of Skain, and the &s;coundreli&s;m of the &s;crivener.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t as the taylor's footman (who, I can a&s;&s;ure the reader, was a black, with a &s;ilver &s;houlder-knot) had brought the chocolate on a &s;plendid waiter, a fre&s;h

Aha! cried Thrift, if here is not little Dodge him&s;elf! Mr. Dodge, &s;ays Skane, (tak|ing him by the dirty hand with great cordiality) I am infinitely indebted to your diligence!&mdash;I wi&s;hed in my heart the catchpole had broke his neck for his pains.&mdash;The gentlemen, re&s;umes Mr. Thrift, are de&s;irous to know the methods you u&s;ed to take Ma&s;ter Sud|berry. Oh! cries Dodge, 'twill do your heart good to hear it: in all the time I have been in office, never &s;aw &s;uch a go in my life.

<PB N="41" REF="48">as if it was ha&s;ty-pudding, and had no <HI>&s;picion</HI> of we, till the maid opened the door, to fetch a pennurth of porter, and then we tu&s;&s;el'd her again&s;t the door-po&s;t, and made directly all three together to the garret: but the maid by this time <HI>&s;pecting</HI> us, cried out to her ma&s;ter, Lock the door, Sir, lock the door, here's a parcel of <HI>baillees</HI> in the hou&s;e: with that his &s;pou&s;e (as I think it was by her running) fa&s;tened the door, and drew the bolt acro&s;s in a cur&s;|ed flu&s;ter; and, to make it the more &s;ecurer (for women, you know, gen|tlemen, are for always overdoing the thing) &s;he &s;et the chairs and tables again&s;t it. Now, your honours mu&s;t know that we dare as well be d&mdash;d as break a lock, though it's law to lift a batch: &s;o what does me I, but, &s;eeing
<PB N="42" REF="49">as how the woman belonging to the hou&s;e was a poor honey, I lays me down at the &s;top of the &s;tairs, and threaten|ed to &s;tarve them out; for, you know, we are all forced to eat, an' the devil him&s;elf &s;tood at the door. All this time Sudberry (for whom I always had the needful in my pocket) &s;aid never a word, but kept pu&s;&s;ing and catching at the breath, like a broken-winded hor&s;e; for I finds he has your <HI>ar&s;e-mak|cack</HI> di&s;order upon him, and they &s;ay, air is the be&s;t thing in the world for that. Mrs. Sudberry, (a fine creature as ever you &s;aw, gentlemen,) began to <HI>argufy</HI> with us, touching our going o&s;t the premi&s;es, and upon my &s;oul, talked over the thing in &s;uch a moving manner, every now and then &s;topping
<PB N="43" REF="50">to &s;ob, that if it had not been doing an injury to Mr. Skain here, I could have found in my heart to have left um. But I am but an humble &s;ervant of his maje&s;ty's, and mu&s;t do my duty according to my con&s;cience. This made me go through it. We &s;tayed in this manner about four hours, till the watchmen went about; then, as &s;ure as you are alive, the woman called out to Martin Napguard, and &s;aid rob|bers and ru&s;&s;ians were broke in to the hou&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his taking us to the watch-hou&s;e. Lord help her head! How little &s;he knows who and who's together. Robbers, ma'am! cri|ed Napguard: I can't take them out of the hou&s;e, if it were full&mdash;but, if you deliver them to me on the out&s;ide the door, then I can charge them in
<PB N="44" REF="51">the king's name, and take them away. This &s;et us all a laughing. Pray, Ma|dam, &s;aid Slappim, (who is as great a wit as any in England, and has as much to &s;ay for him&s;elf)&mdash;pray, deliver us on the out&s;ide the door, and then we will all go jollily to pri&s;on toge|ther. To make &s;hort of the matter, it began to grow late, and &s;o, hearing as how they were drawing the cur|tains, and preparing for bed, without caring for &s;upper, I and my compani|ons went to bed too.&mdash;And where might you &s;leep, pray? &s;aid Mr. Dra|per. At the &s;tair-head, your honour, replied the bailiff; and a very good lodging too. But in the middle of the night, Sudberry began to grunt wor&s;e than ever&mdash;the children &s;et up their pipes between-whiles, for bread,
<PB N="45" REF="52">and the mother was one time ki&s;&s;ing one, then the other, then chearing up the hu&s;band, while we got &s;ome liquor from next door, made the landlady tip&s;y, and was &s;ure of our game in the morning. But <HI>cu&s;s</HI> me, if that Mrs. Sudberry is not a match for all the officers in town. She's a deep one, I promi&s;e you&mdash;In the morning, d&mdash;n my eyes, gentlemen, if &s;he did not fairly bilk us, do what we would. How was that, Ma&s;ter Dodge? &s;aid Skain, a little di&s;appointed&mdash;There is a little back room, continued Dodge, about a yard wide, with a little peep|hole of a ca&s;ement, ju&s;t big enough to heave in a twopenny loaf, and a &s;mall tea-kettle: into this window &s;he drew her victuals, throwing a &s;tring to the
<PB N="46" REF="53">maid to tie, fed her children, boiled a little broth in a cann for her hu&s;band, and threatened to do &s;o till Sunday, when you know the law&mdash;the more's the pity for the nation&mdash;does not &s;uffer us to do bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme put us all to our wits end, and we now began to be faucy a little, hoping to make her hu&s;band in a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o open the door. Trugge, therefore, (who has a foul mouth of his own, when he plea&s;es.) talked <HI>balderda&s;h</HI> to Mrs. Sudberry, through the key-hole, which &s;he did not an&s;wer, for, indeed, &s;he &s;eems a civil &s;poken woman, truly: but Slap|pim &s;aid <HI>&s;ommit</HI> to ri&s;e the hu&s;band at la&s;t, and without more ado, quite forgetting his &s;ickne&s;s, he bur&s;t
<PB N="47" REF="54">the door open in an in&s;tant, with a drawn &s;word in his hand&mdash;(an old black one though, without a handle) and &s;wore he would &s;tab the fir&s;t man upon earth, that &s;hould dare to <HI>re|&s;ult</HI> his wife. This was ju&s;t what we wanted; and while I beat off his &s;word with my &s;tick, in this manner &mdash;(here the bailiff &s;tood on the de|&s;en&s;ive) Trugge tripped up his heels behind, and Slappim gave him a <HI>dou&s;e</HI> on the &s;houlder.&mdash;Then off we carried him, hooting through the &s;treets, and you would have died a laughing to have &s;een us march: it was for all the world like a <HI>burien.</HI> Slappim and Trugge walked with him in their arms (for he could not &s;tand, and had never a &s;hilling for a coach),
<PB N="48" REF="55">I &s;trutted as head mourner, or ra|ther as par&s;on: Mrs. Sudberry came crying after, and the three birds whimpering along, got fa&s;t hold of the mother's gown, and &s;ung through the no&s;e, in a &s;orrowful merry man|ner, the dead man's p&s;alm.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this narrative, Mr. Dodge twitched his wig, &s;troaked the &s;tock which was tied round the neck that would have di&s;graced a halter, and looked at every &s;pecta|tor for applau&s;e; as if he had really been doing the mo&s;t meritorious ac|tion upon earth.</P>

<P>There are many occa&s;ions where language is extremely inadequate to expre&s;s our &s;en&s;ations. The pre&s;ent was one of them. My anxiety, as Shake|&s;pear has it, "beggared all de&s;crip|tion," and I was unable to tell my dete&s;tation, or my pity. As &s;oon as Dodge had done, Draper ro&s;e from his chair, with a &s;edater &s;et of fea|tures than u&s;ual, and demanded Dodge's direction, which being ob|tained, he ordered Skain to &s;end his fellow for a hackney-coach; and while it was gone for, he a&s;&s;umed a &s;till &s;everer look, and addre&s;&s;ed the company in this manner.

<PB N="51" REF="58">your villainous interpo&s;ition, would live harmoniou&s;ly and neighbourly to|gether.&mdash;Sir, an&s;wered Thrift, I am not u&s;ed to this treatment, and I &s;hall be tempted to bring my action, if&mdash; Action, ra&s;cal! replied Mr. Draper, begone, and take care you don't tempt <HI>me</HI> to an action that may rob the gal|lows of its property. Well, well&mdash; very fine, very fine, upon my &s;oul, cried Thrift, trembling and ri&s;ing, pretty u&s;age this, for a man of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion&mdash;however, it is well I am pro|vided with witne&s;&s;es: pray hold your|&s;elves in readine&s;s, gentlemen, I &s;hall &s;ummon you as evidences of the a&s;|fault, and &s;o, Sir, your &s;ervant! I'll do you over with a &s;lip of parchment, I warrant you. As he opened the door, Dodge made an effort to &s;teal
<PB N="52" REF="59">out with him, &s;agaciou&s;ly pre&s;uming, that if Thrift was a &s;coundrel, he could not him&s;elf be thought an hone&s;t man: but Mr. Draper plucked him back by the &s;kirts, and in&s;i&s;ted on his taking his &s;hare of admonition. And you, Mr. Mancatcher, cried Draper, by what &s;tatute or clau&s;e in an act of parlia|ment are you permitted to treat the unfortunate in this barbarous manner: what right have you to in&s;ult a poor man and his family, by your loo&s;e je&s;ts, ribaldry, and ob&s;cenity? Who gave you authority to trip up a gen|tleman's heels, and by what licence is it, that you dare to make a riot and di&s;turbance at any per&s;on's door at all? Much le&s;s to continue there like an a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in all night. If it had been my ca&s;e, &s;irrah, I would have made no he&s;ita|tion
<PB N="53" REF="60">of &s;hooting you through the head, or running you through the body as a thief. Pur&s;ue your infamous avoca|tion openly and fairly, but I will be at &s;ome little pains to &s;ee whether you are to turn hou&s;ebreaker, and knock a man down to get at him.</P>
<P>While Mr. Draper was expo&s;tulating in this manner, Dodge played with his hat, bit his nails, changed colour, hung his head, &s;hook his ears, and &s;lunk after Thrift, in a pitiful and cowardly condition: for let this be adopted as a rule, that tho&s;e who exi&s;t by pro|moting the anxiety of others, and take the bread out of the mouth of the wretched, or are in any other way the mini&s;ters of inhumanity and oppre&s;|&s;ion, are invariably a mean da&s;tardly &s;et of poltroons, afraid to meet the eye
<PB N="54" REF="61">of a man, or to look but for a &s;ingle into their own frightful bo&s;oms. When Dodge di&s;appeared, Draper addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the taylor, who, ever &s;ince the di&s;cour&s;e began, &s;at leaning his el|bow on the table, as if he had been &s;tunned; for Draper being a man of very exten&s;ive connections, Skain, who was a mere u&s;urer at the bottom, would almo&s;t as &s;oon have &s;et his pri|&s;oner at liberty, as have offended &s;o excellent a cu&s;tomer.&mdash;As for you, Skain, proceeded Draper, I blu&s;h for you. You, Sir, who have realized a fortune, by a commerce with people of fortune; nay, who have by your own confe&s;&s;ion, received obligations from the very man whom you are thus vigilant and indu&s;trious to per|&s;ecute: is not half your profit contin|gent
<PB N="55" REF="62">upon credit, and are you not &s;o much aware of this, as frequently to force that credit upon gentlemen much to their di&s;inclination, and &s;till more to their di&s;advantage? But why do I wa&s;te time in remon&s;trances with a fellow, whom impo&s;ition has enabled to &s;et up a chariot: a wretch who&s;e extortions have been the total de&s;truc|tion of many a minor, and who is a &s;candal to the fair-dealing trade&s;man. I have done with you, Sir, and I will take care that all my friends &s;hall have done with you too&mdash;I de&s;ire you will &s;end in my accompt directly, and I will never have the lea&s;t intercour&s;e with you after it is paid. Such was now the meanne&s;s of this fellow, that when Mr. Draper was taking me by the hand, and preparing to depart, he
<PB N="56" REF="63">&s;aid, if he plea&s;ed to continue his cu&s;|tom, he would relea&s;e Mr. Sudberry. That you &s;hall not, Mr. Taylor, &s;aid I, contemptuou&s;ly, I'll a&s;&s;ure you: Come, Mr. Draper, let us go immedi|ately to the bailiffs. Puppy, cried Draper (turning upon Skain as he was going out) Mr. Sudberry would &s;corn to owe even his liberty to &s;uch a wretch&mdash;I have already heard enough to convince me he would rot inch by inch in his jail, rather than be relea&s;ed by his per&s;ecutor. Benignus, I am at your &s;ervice; let us go and prevent this fellow, and his precious group of friends, from triumphing over the &s;ick and the unhappy: Drive, coachman, to Dodge's lock-up-hou&s;e, Holborn bars.</P>

<P>Among the peculiar plea&s;ures of human life are, agreeable &s;urprizes. This la&s;t &s;troke of conduct &s;o reconcil|ed me to Mr. Draper, that I looked at him with tran&s;port, and again thought him one of the worthie&s;t of men. A little eccentric and irregular, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, a little out of the common road, but not the le&s;s kind or ho&s;pitable for that: the &s;allies which look mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious, are probably mere &s;portivene&s;s, the effects of health, high &s;pirits, heat of blood, and an ani|mated fancy. Sen&s;e he has evidently; wit is at his command; he is prepar|ing
<PB N="58" REF="65">to be generous, let me then not be too &s;evere upon his vivacity, but allow &s;o good a character, upon the whole, its plea&s;antries and laugh.</P>
<P>We &s;topped at a hou&s;e, fortified with bars of iron, and upon entering it, beheld Thrift and Dodge laying their heads clo&s;e together. Where's Mr. Sudberry? &s;aid Mr. Draper. Sir, an&s;wered Thrift, may I crave two minutes audience of you alone: they walked together into a &s;mall yard, well &s;ecured by a roof of beams, and this was the conver&s;ation of the &s;cri|vener.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;ir, you are a gentleman who knows &s;omething; I am &s;orry for any little warm words we may have exchanged, and I a&s;k your par|don. To your bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ir, &s;aid Mr.
<PB N="59" REF="66">Draper. Why, &s;ir, rejoined Thri&s;t, I find there is a little mi&s;take in this bu&s;ine&s;s; the officer has acted, &s;ir, without my a&s;&s;ent, and &s;o there is a kind of a&mdash;a&mdash;here a violent noi&s;e in the hou&s;e interrupted the di&s;cour&s;e, and brought Draper back to me to enquire the occa&s;ion, which happened to be a debate be|twixt Mr. Sudberry, the pri&s;oner, and Mr. Dodge, the officer, who went in to the &s;aid pri&s;oner's little room, upon his leaving Thrift with Mr. Draper. The &s;entiments which now i&s;&s;ued from the key-hole of his room, were to the following pur|port.</P>
<P>Oh inhuman creature, to drag me, in this &s;ituation, with all my family after me, when you were con&s;cious
<PB N="60" REF="67">I had it not in my power: nay, when three weeks before, you came with that vile lawyer to my old lodgings, and &s;uffered my poor wife, this dear woman, to pawn her la&s;t gown, and almo&s;t her la&s;t apron, to give you ci|vility money, that you <HI>&s;hould not &s;ee me.</HI> Be&s;ides this, have you not ar|re&s;ted me for a fal&s;e debt: nay, do you not know in your hearts that Mr. Skain has twice the value of my debt in his hands: has he not a picture I gave Mrs. Sudberry, on the very morning of our marriage, and which &s;he (<HI>unknown</HI> to me, till lately, placed as a pledge with him, to prevent my being troubled long ago, when things began to run wrong with me. Oh, that I had &s;ome friend
<PB N="61" REF="68">&s;nat&mdash;but I may &s;till live to &s;ee you &s;everely puni&s;hed. At the very be|ginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, Thrift was &s;hifting towards the door, and, upon mention of the wink money, he was driving off as fa&s;t as he could, when Draper caught him by the collar, while I, in&s;pired by an impul&s;e too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted, &s;et my back again&s;t the door, (which was none of the &s;lighte&s;t,) and fairly bur&s;t it open. This violence di&s;covered Mrs. Sud|berry and her children, weeping on a dirty floor, Mr. Sudberry &s;upporting him&s;elf again&s;t a chair, arraigning the villainy of the bailiff, and lawyer, and the bailiff him&s;elf &s;cratching his head, and beginning to think&mdash;not that he was a greater ra&s;cal than ordinary, but that he had been a more than or|dinary
<PB N="62" REF="69">blockhead, in not taking the u&s;ual care to keep within the letter of the law.</P>
<P>Intere&s;ting, however, as the &s;cene was, it was con&s;iderably heightened by the addition of that glorious cha|racter, Mr. Thrift, who, (unbraced from top to bottom, without his pe|riwig, which had &s;or&s;aken his pate in the &s;cuffle,) was now drawn in by the intrepid Draper, to give a &s;plendid fini&s;hing to the drama. Several other pri&s;oners of the place, likewi&s;e, and all the &s;ervants, (even to the continal of the &s;treet-door, which was the tru&s;ty Mr. Trugge him&s;elf,) came pear|ing into the parlour, and were vat|ni&s;&s;es to the general confu&s;ion. For my part, I ran in&s;en&s;ibly to the &s;ink|ing Mrs. Sudberry, while the poor
<PB N="63" REF="70">fainting hu&s;band encouraged his ba|bies, as well as he was able, not to be frighted; a&s;&s;ured them their papa was well, that nobody would hurt their mamma, and that the &s;tranger men were only playing in &s;port. Oh my dear papa&mdash;my dear papa, give brother and I a piece of bread and butter, pray do, indeed we will be good and de&s;erve it&mdash;indeed we will; won't we, Patty?&mdash;I litty piece of bren e butte too, li&s;ped a little angel, &s;till unweaned from the knee, I hungy as well as Patty. A &s;ervant girl, as yet unhardened by her &s;ervitude in the family, touched by the innocent prattle, ran down into the kitchen, and, in the confu&s;ion, brought a lun|cheon of bread, which I &s;eized in|&s;tantly from her, and kneeling down,
<PB N="64" REF="71">di&s;tributed it among&s;t them. Pray, &s;ir, give poor papa and mamma a bit, &s;aid the elde&s;t. I will, cried the &s;e|cond, offering half to Mrs. Sudberry, who was &s;ilently thanking God on her knees&mdash;No, me vil feed my own papa, cried the &s;uckling.&mdash;Poor Sud|berry attempted to ki&s;s the child, but wanting &s;trength to kneel, fell back|wards into my arms, yet not &s;o as to hurt him&s;elf; when the little things had fini&s;hed their repa&s;t, and had &s;ipped each a little water, which the kind-hearted girl likewi&s;e provided, they wiped their &s;weet lips each up|on its bib, ki&s;&s;ed me round for my goodne&s;s, and putting their pretty palms together, thanked God for a good dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="72">Meantime Draper was not idle. The truth is, he had the way now fair before him; the bailiff and &s;cri|vener &s;aw them&s;elves detected; they knew the &s;pirited character of Mr. Draper, and they were ready to come into any terms, rather than forfeit their honourable calling.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, &s;aid Draper, either re&s;tore the gentleman his picture, or relea&s;e him: in the next, repay him the money you extorted from him, that you might <HI>not &s;ee him,</HI> when you had a writ again&s;t his per&s;on. I have not got the <HI>picture,</HI> your honour, &s;aid the bailiff, and if I &s;hould di&s;|charge the gemmin without con&s;ent of plaintiff, I &s;hould be fixed with debt and co&s;ts, as dead as a nail; and moreover nor that, the gemmin,
<PB N="66" REF="73">I under&s;tand is liable to more thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t him, than this here; and if &s;o be as how there &s;hould be fifty retain|ders in the office, one upon t'other, I mu&s;t an&s;wer 'em all, and that there Mr. Thrift knows well enough el&s;e I am &s;ure I would not mind the value of Mr. Skain's matter, the wipe of my finger. As you plea&s;e, &s;ir, &s;ays Draper; then I will be bail for this gentleman, and my friend &s;hall be the other, and we will be an&s;werable for every thing. Make out the bail|bond, and look you to the con&s;e|quence.</P>

<P>This propo&s;al coming from a man of fortune, and a man acquainted with the world, was by no means agreeable either to Mr. Dodge or Mr. Thrift; for, be&s;ides that they dread|ed bringing the matter before a court, they were equally in fear of the many evidences which now had it in their power to appear again&s;t them. Mr. Draper, however, was the la&s;t man in the kingdom to be trifled with, and indeed was altogether the mo&s;t univer&s;al character I ever knew; as he could &s;uit him&s;elf, with wonderful facility, to all circum&s;tances in &s;o|ciety, and was either remarkable for
<PB N="68" REF="75">indolence or indu&s;try, gaiety or gra|vity, as &s;eemed mo&s;t agreeable to the ca&s;t and con&s;titution of the company.</P>
<P>The loquacious humour, therefore, in which he was in, at Mrs. Darling|tons, when I &s;et him down as a com|pound of laugh, whim, and liberty, was only the a&s;&s;umed di&s;po&s;ition of the moment, which he thought (per|haps ju&s;tly) was better adapted to the &s;prightly hour of breakfa&s;t, and the liveline&s;s of the ladies whom he vi|&s;ited, than the dulle&s;t detail of mo|rals, or the mo&s;t formal lecture upon the beauty of holine&s;s. And this ver&s;atility &s;at &s;o prodigiou&s;ly ea&s;y upon him, and was an art &s;o imme|diately upon the heel of nature, that nothing but the God of nature him|&s;elf could know it to be imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="76">But I can oblige my readers with no idea of this gentleman &s;o well, as by comparing him with a per&s;on who, a little before the time of my retiring from the town, and the world, began to figure on the &s;tage, and to a&s;toni&s;h: &s;uch of my readers, therefore, who have &s;een Mr. Gar|rick command the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul, and a&s;&s;ume at will the charac|ters belonging to them; tho&s;e who have beheld him at one hour, the pert, &s;lippant, carele&s;s, voluble cox|comb; at another, the injured, ten|der, choleric, heart-broken king and father; tho&s;e who have &s;een him on one night repre&s;ent, and to all pal|pable apprehen&s;ion, <HI>be,</HI> the haughty, di&s;dainful, de&s;igning, tyrant, and then the generous, elegant, and manly
<PB N="70" REF="77">lover; now inviting our admiration at the heroi&s;m of youth, and now exciting our compa&s;&s;ion at the de|bility of age: tho&s;e, in a word, who have <HI>certainly</HI> been in a theatre (while this gentleman was acting) and yet have almo&s;t quarrelled with convic|tion, by a violent inclination to <HI>di&s;|pute,</HI> either their being in a theatre, or that the man on the &s;tage was only a clever counterfeit; tho&s;e, I &s;ay, who have been witne&s;&s;es to the changes of this amazing performer, will properly conceive of the infinite variety in the &s;ingle character of that &s;ocial Proteus, Mr. Draper.</P>
<P>While I have been letting the read|er a little more into the &s;ecret of my friend's character, he will plea&s;e to &s;up|po&s;e Me&s;&s;rs. Thrift and Dodge were
<PB N="71" REF="78">retired to a corner of the room, in deep con&s;ultation; and that the Sudberrys were complimenting fir&s;t Mr. Draper, and then me, as if we had been me&s;|&s;engers from heaven. The middle of the parlour contained the crowd of captive &s;pectators, all of whom&mdash;a &s;trange mixture of men and women&mdash; triumphed extremely in the embarra&s;|ment of the jailor, and heartily hoped to &s;ee both him and the &s;crivener turned off together. At length Mr. Draper &s;aid, he &s;hould wait their deli|berations no longer, he was in a hur|ry, and ordered him to prepare the bond, without any delay. This pro|duced another whi&s;per from Thrift, who, taking Mr. Draper gently by the coat-button, and leading him with many cringes to the window, a&s;ked,
<PB N="72" REF="79">with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, whether he (Mr. Draper) knew what he was about! Do you know, my good Sir, &s;aid he, do you know what you are liable to by bailing this pri&s;oner: the clouds are very heavy over his head, and the tempe&s;t mu&s;t light upon you. I can have no intere&s;t; nay, I &s;peak again&s;t my&s;elf, for I &s;hall touch, if I make out a bail-bond for Ma&s;ter Dodge (who, between you and me, can't &s;pell his own name, without I am at his elbow), &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, I was to &s;tep to Mr. Skain's, and inter|cede for the pri&s;oner, whom I pity, from the very bottom of my &s;oul, and perhaps, at my in&s;tigation, and mak|ing u&s;e of your name, he may be in|duced to take the debt at &s;o much a week, or give him a little time to turn
<PB N="73" REF="80">about, or&mdash;I tell you, fellow, replied Draper, he &s;hall have nothing to do with you, or Skain, or any &s;uch ra&s;|cals. This is the pri&s;oner: &s;hew me the warrant, that I may know the amount of the debt. That young gen|tleman and my&s;elf are his bail, and &s;o refu&s;e the matter at your peril&mdash;Do it this in&s;tant, or you will oblige me to &s;end for my own attorney, who will an&s;wer you in a minute. Perhaps you know Mr. Tullyman of the Temple? At the name of Tullyman, Thrift &s;hrunk into him&s;elf, and was &s;ilenced. Then &s;poke his illu&s;trious compeer, Mr. Dodge.&mdash;Well, well, if his ho|nour chu&s;es for to go for to run all <HI>ri&s;que&s;es,</HI> he mu&s;t. It is none of my af|fair: I gets nothing by pri&s;oners more nor my dues: and &s;o Mr. Thrift mu&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="81">e'en get the bail-bond drawn out; &s;eeing as how his honour is re&s;olved upon it. But his honour, I hopes, will have no objection for me, for to make a bit of an inquiration about his honour's <HI>charactur,</HI> &s;eeing as how I never &s;ee'd his honour before; and though no doubt he is a man of fortin and pro|perty, his honour is a &s;tranger to me, and nobody knows nobody in Lon|don. So if he thinks good for me to &s;end Trugge into neighbourhood, and ju&s;t ax three or four, or half a dozen of the &s;hop-keepers, to know who you are, and what your honour is, I &s;hall be proud to take the bail.&mdash;While Mr. Dodge was delivering this &s;plendid harangue, the blood flu&s;hed over Mr. Draper's hand&s;ome face, and he &s;lou|ri&s;hed his cane in his hand, in token
<PB N="75" REF="82">of no very plea&s;ant preparation; and it is highly probable Mr. Dodge would have had a perfect knowledge of this gentleman's character, and of the heal|thy &s;tate of his body, together with his great &s;kill in the &s;cience of ca&s;tigat|ing a &s;coundrel, had not his friend Thrift that moment interpo&s;ed, by de|claring that he knew Mr. Draper ex|tremely well, and would take his &s;ecu|rity for a thou&s;and pounds; and that if he would only an&s;wer for the pri&s;o|ner's appearance at the return of the writ on the &s;ub&s;equent Friday, he would take the re&s;t upon him&s;elf; and, as he admired a generous action as much as any man, would get over the article of omitting to &s;earch the office as well as he could.&mdash;This, however, was afterwards related to me by Mr.
<PB N="76" REF="83">Draper; for Thrift did not, for cer|tain rea&s;ons, chu&s;e to utter this &s;peech before a large audience; to avoid which piece of o&s;tentation (like a man willing to do his generous act in as private a way as he could) he once more had recour&s;e to Draper's button, and led him ob&s;equiou&s;ly thereby into another room. At his return Mr. Draper politely and tenderly informed Mr. Sudberry, that he was now at li|berty to remove his family into more agreeable apartments, and &s;aid he had taken the liberty to order one of the fellows to call a coach for that pur|po&s;e. Here was another in&s;tance, where words were mere expletives, and &s;o I can only ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e readers who have the be&s;t hearts and &s;ine&s;t heads, will have the ju&s;te&s;t conceptions
<PB N="77" REF="84">of the &s;cene which now pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the benefactor and the benefited. Meantime Thrift whi&s;pered over the perils which would probably be avoid|ed by this &s;tep, and that it would be good law to turn out the pri&s;oner, ra|ther than be turned out them&s;elves, which it is pre&s;umed, might be rea&s;on|ably expected from a public explana|tion of this my&s;terious affair: Mr. Thrift's whi&s;per was of that kind which on the &s;tage is called a &s;olilo|quy&mdash;that is one talking as loud to him&s;elf as if he was in warm debate with a large &s;ociety. But this was the defect of his voice, which could by no management of modulation, (being na|turally har&s;h, heavy, and hoar&s;e,) be brought to the &s;till &s;mall whi&s;per, or, theatrically &s;peaking, into the <HI>all alone,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="85">or even <HI>half a&s;ide;</HI> for let it likewi&s;e be remarked by the bye, that the &s;tage talking to <HI>one's &s;elf,</HI> is con&s;iderably more audible, than the <HI>half a&s;ide,</HI> when <HI>others</HI> are on the &s;cene.</P>

<P>The pri&s;oners al&s;o now began to &s;ing forth the prai&s;es of genero&s;ity, and enter into various ob&s;ervations. One &s;aid, it was well for &s;ome folks that they could find friends in &s;tran|gers; others remarked, that &s;ome people were lucky, and &s;ome unlucky: Ay, &s;ays a dry-looking fellow, &s;quint|ing over a woman's &s;houlder, I have been here &s;ixteen months my&s;elf, and
<PB N="79" REF="86">could never get any body to do &s;uch a turn for me, but then, indeed, I hap|pen to have a plain woman for my wife: here he cock'd his eye at Mrs. Sudberry, and Draper, who perfectly under&s;tood the in&s;inuation, but thought the in&s;inuator in no &s;ituation to an|&s;wer for it, only look'd a reproach, and led the way to the coach, which was now driving up to the door. I was going to di&s;tribute a few guineas among&s;t the multitude, but Draper pre&s;&s;ed me &s;ignificantly by the hand, and bid me a&s;&s;i&s;t Mrs. and Mr. Sud|berry to the carriage; declining that agreeable office him&s;elf, probably to prevent giving umbrage and counte|nance to the &s;entiments of the other pri&s;oner. As we pa&s;&s;ed along, and were placing the lady and her little
<PB N="80" REF="87">ones into the coach, the ingenious Mr. Dodge, with much &s;imper and civility, applied his &s;ingers to his hat, and his nails to his head (for hitherto, from polite rea&s;ons, he thought proper to wear his round beaver, which was rim'd with a black binding) and, in a tone betwixt &s;ervility and demand, thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr. Draper: I hopes as how your honour will re|member me for my goodne&s;s and <HI>u|manity,</HI> and the like of that, &s;eeing as how I had it in my power, whether or no to let the gemmin go, without paying the money; and &s;eeing as how I am &s;till &s;pon&s;or as well as your ho|nour, for his forthcoming as <HI>plantiff,</HI> if your honour &s;hould die, being as we are all <HI>mortable,</HI> before Friday, and the gemmin &s;hould go off with his bo|dy,
<PB N="81" REF="88">which, to be &s;ure, by law is none of his property at pre&s;ent: and be&s;ides, furthermore than this, <HI>ater</HI> twenty|four hours, I could, if it <HI>wan't</HI> for my <HI>umanity,</HI> carry pri&s;oner over the wa|ter; and as likewi&s;e I have lo&s;t bail|money, and let out, gemmin, as it were, on padrowl and prorogation of honour, &s;eeing as life is a lottery, and I may or may not clap eyes on him a|gain, becau&s;e hap you know is ju&s;t as it happens; wherefore I hope my <HI>jen|nyro&s;ity</HI> will be rewarded.&mdash;While Dodge was delivering the&s;e elegant &s;enti|ments, I was handing in Mr. Sud|berry and her &s;ick partner, while Dra|per, with great gentlene&s;s, was placing the children as commodiou&s;ly and clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible by the &s;ide of their
<PB N="82" REF="89">parents; which being done, and the door fa&s;tened, Mr. Draper fir&s;t inquir|ing, whether he might be permitted to do for once as he plea&s;ed with the little family, directed the coachman to go &s;oftly over the &s;tones, and &s;top at the corner-hou&s;e on the left-hand &s;ide, in Dover-Street. Thus was all the <HI>umanity</HI> and <HI>jennyro&s;ity</HI> of Mr. Dodge, totally lo&s;t in air, and his la&s;t words were quite &s;wallowed up by the le&s;s eloquent language of the carriage|wheels and the driver. A great paint|er, who&s;e <HI>forte</HI> lay in the pathetic and tender, might now have been furni&s;h|ed with exqui&s;ite hints for a family|picture: never &s;urely were &s;een a coach|ful of characters more &s;uited to the pencil. Mrs. Sudberry (a tall, intere&s;t|ing, lovely figure) was &s;eated betwixt
<PB N="83" REF="90">her hu&s;band and infants; in the eye of poor Sudberry him&s;elf gli&s;ten'd the drop of gratitude, &s;upported on the one hand by his wife, on the other by Draper. One of the babes, with a cherubic chearfulne&s;s of countenance, was gently playing with the hand of its mother, and one was &s;oftly &s;troak|ing the languid face of the father; while the third (which was &s;eated on my knee) &s;eemed highly delighted with the &s;hewy trinkets, that depend|ed from the glittering watch-chain which I had purcha&s;ed of the toyman. In this &s;ituation, in which Sudberry's di&s;order, that even a joyful change of events could not remove, was the on|ly matter of inquietude, we arrived in Dover Street, at the elegant re&s;idence of Mr. Draper. That gentleman was
<PB N="84" REF="91">out in a moment, and welcomed his company with &s;uch an air of una&s;&s;um|ing ho&s;pitality, that his vi&s;itants for|got it was a fir&s;t &s;alutation, and were plea&s;ingly &s;educed into intimacy, ere they had well concluded and com|pletely interchanged the civilities of introduction. The apartments of Mr. Draper be&s;poke at the &s;ame in&s;tant the ta&s;te and temper of the ma&s;ter: the furniture was in the highe&s;t &s;plen|dor of fa&s;hion, without any thing ap|proaching to frippery. We were con|ducted into a dining-room, in which was exhibited all the prettine&s;&s;es of an ample fortune; but Mr. Draper's be|haviour was infinitely more engaging than any other object in his room. He led the panting Sudberry up along the room, and &s;eated him on a &s;opha; he
<PB N="85" REF="92">pre&s;&s;ed him, and at length prevailed upon him to &s;wallow a cordial; while I and the re&s;t of the Sudberrys, even to the younge&s;t infant (which &s;eemed more attracted by the conduct of the benefactor, than by the &s;inery of the furniture, and the flowers in the car|pet) were under the influence of an enchantment &s;o truly &s;oothing and be|nevolent, that the whole appeared to be rather the delicious vi&s;ion of a glowing fancy, than a real &s;cene in the great drama of modern life.</P>

<P>And yet no urbanity, nor any arts of delicate attention from our ho&s;t,
<PB N="86" REF="93">could prevent the tear from often ga|thering in the eye, and often falling upon the cheek of the beautiful Mrs. Sudberry. The &s;tate of her hu&s;band's health ab&s;orbed every other idea, and &s;he could not be re&s;tricted, even by her politene&s;s, from hanging around his neck, wiping away the drop which a&s;thmatic agony had collected on his brow, and relieving him by every po&s;|&s;ible mark of an endearment which no &s;ickne&s;s could impair, nor any hu|man misfortune in any degree abate. Pre&s;ently, however, the cordial had &s;uch effect, at lea&s;t &s;o far a&s;&s;i&s;ted the tender and re&s;toring a&s;&s;iduities of a be|loved wi&s;e, that he began to breathe with le&s;s di&s;&s;iculty, and to &s;eem more capable of enjoying his good fortune. Mr. Draper now improved this inter|val
<PB N="87" REF="94">of ea&s;e by the charms of his con|ver&s;ation, and by that characteri&s;tic &s;prightline&s;s which rendered him &s;o enchantingly agreeable. I am now about to do a very rude thing, &s;aid he, my good friends, and yet I cannot po&s;|&s;ibly help it: indi&s;pen&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s, from which even the plea&s;ures of &s;o|ciety mu&s;t not &s;educe me, requires my attention. I &s;hall not be gone above half an hour: my friend Benignus will extremely well &s;upply my ab&s;ence, and I will take care to call on Mrs. Dar|lington, and make excu&s;es for you know what mi&s;demeanours, Benig|nus, before I return. Nay, keep your &s;eats&mdash;no polite confu&s;ion&mdash;no com|pliment pray now. He bowed, and withdrew.</P>
<P>As Sudberry was now much reco|vered,
<PB N="88" REF="95">at lea&s;t as his pain very favour|ably intermitted, his lovely wife hap|pening to &s;it oppo&s;ite a pier-gla&s;s, ob|&s;erving &s;omething in the reflection, which brought an unu&s;ual quantity of blood into her face, &s;he threw her eye over her children tran&s;iently, but &s;aid nothing. I had, however, &s;ome little rea&s;on afterwards to be|lieve this blu&s;h aro&s;e from that deli|cate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which &s;ometimes we feel, from a &s;en&s;e of wanting tho&s;e things which the world con&s;iders as the nece&s;&s;ary furniture of every per|&s;on who is admitted into a good apart|ment: namely, &s;uch a &s;uit of &s;ilks and broadcloth, linens and laces, as cor|re&s;pond with the chairs and tables, cu&s;hions and carpets, plate and china in the &s;aid apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="96">Now it happened (as the reader cannot indeed forget) that our little family had dive&s;ted them&s;elves of all &s;uperfluous decorations, even to the picture of the principal, which was wont to grace the arm of the wife, but which now was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Skain the taylor; yet Mrs. Sudberry was &s;till as neat as a clean linen-gown could make her, her infants were habited in &s;lips, or robes, evidently made by a ma|ternal hand, and from the materials of a frugal hou&s;ewifry, that decorates the child with an alteration of that which is no longer &s;uitable to the parent; and Sudberry was in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of at lea&s;t as tolerable a &s;uit of grey, as that &s;uit of black which I wore my&s;elf; and they looked as if
<PB N="90" REF="97">fate had prevented my getting newer apparel, till I had kept his mode&s;t grey in countenance. This inge|nuous anxiety, however, was &s;oon over, for Sudberry got better and better, the children played, and prattled, the &s;un &s;hot cheerily into the room, Mrs. Sudberry &s;miled, and began to think of conver&s;ation, and Draper &s;peedily returned.</P>

<P>By this time, preparations were making for a &s;ix o'clock dinner; but as nothing worth &s;etting down in this Hi&s;tory happened till the cloth was removed, I &s;hall a&s;k the reader's leave to &s;et the gla&s;&s;es upon the table.
<PB N="91" REF="98">and pa&s;s bri&s;kly on to &s;omething more material. The human imagination, even in its mo&s;t poetical moment, can conceive nothing &s;o highly calculated to give fre&s;h &s;pirit to Burgundy, as Mr. Draper's various conver&s;ation. He was the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent man in the world, amid&s;t the greate&s;t incon|&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncies; that is, he &s;o nicely ob|&s;erved the grand articles of times, &s;ealons, and circum&s;tances, that his character was con&s;tantly of a piece with the character of the &s;ociety then pre&s;ent. He was now in company with a married woman, a man under &s;ingular embarra&s;&s;ments, and three little children ri&s;ing up under the eye of a mode&s;t mother; and moreover the whole family were under recent obligations to him. To &s;upport him|&s;elf
<PB N="92" REF="99">in this &s;ituation, without violating his delicacy, one would &s;uppo&s;e, no ea&s;y matter; but, in point of addre&s;s, he was ea&s;e it&s;elf. He di&s;tributed his attention to the wife and hu&s;band with &s;o impartial a care, that neither could boa&s;t a compliment extraordi|nary, or complain of a politene&s;s wanting. As the wine &s;lowly circu|lated (for it was not pu&s;hed round the table with an outrageous ho&s;pi|tality), Draper infu&s;ed balm into the gla&s;s, by chatting chearfully upon the pro&s;pect of better days. I have fre|quently thought, madam, &s;aid he, (turning to Mrs. Sudberry) that an unfortunate man is among&s;t the mo&s;t &s;acred of human characters. The hand of God is more immediately up|on him: he is marked out for trial,
<PB N="93" REF="100">and if, when temptations have thick|ened upon him, he &s;till pre&s;erves his patience and his courage, he is indeed an intere&s;ting character. I do not think Mr. Sudberry any otherwi&s;e un|fortunate, than as he is made &s;o by his illne&s;s; if I did, his &s;ituation would be &s;o &s;anctified in my idea, that I &s;hould not look at him without awe. Don't you think him unfortunate, an&s;wered Mrs. Sudberry? Not at all, replied Draper: he has enough to make him quite the contrary: nay, he this moment has in his eye &s;uffi|cient to create content, in the wor&s;t condition.</P>
<P>Mr. Draper had now gained his point; for, touching nicely upon the right &s;tring, he found it in tune: Sudberry and his lady exchanged
<PB N="94" REF="101">looks, &s;urveyed the pledges of their tender fidelity, and indulged a &s;igh. Nor were tho&s;e tender pledges &s;hut out from their &s;hare of attention. They were invited to &s;ip &s;ome &s;weet wine by Mr. Draper, who de&s;ired them to drink according to &s;eniority. The voice of a child, trained up with a &s;en&s;e of duty and civility, is, to the ear of a parent, the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres. Mr. and Mrs. Sudberry gazed with a laudable pride on their babes, as they paid proper preparatory re&s;pects, and looked at Mr. Draper, as much as to &s;ay, the little creatures are of our own bringing up&mdash;they have no ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s but our|&s;elves. When each had taken its al|lowance (which Mrs. Sudberry &s;tinted to as &s;mall a quantum as might very
<PB N="95" REF="102">well be contained in a thimble) the elde&s;t maintained her dignity by &s;it|ting &s;till at the table, and the two other paraded round the room, and very critically examined the orna|ments; not failing to feel and finger every thing in their progre&s;s. Hi|larity now pre&s;ided at our board, and as the Burgundy exerted its generous power, Sudberry was &s;o much re|covered, as to mix in our di&s;cour&s;e. At this cri&s;is Mr. Draper contrived to increa&s;e the general felicity, by a well-timed trifling circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>And how many years may you two turtles have been married? cried he, &s;miling upon his gue&s;ts. <HI>Eleven</HI> years, &s;ir, an&s;wered Sudberry; and they have flown away, as if they had enviou&s;ly borrowed the wings of the wind.
<PB N="96" REF="103">Eleven <HI>minutes</HI> they have been, by my account, rejoined the lady, look|ing at Sudberry&mdash;Oh brave! an&s;wered Draper; then I'd lay my life, every trifle is important; and if this cork|&s;crew was the gift of the one, it would be dear to the other. It would indeed, &s;aid the hu&s;band. Aye, aye, replied Mr. Draper,
<Q><L>Trifles light as air,</L>
<L>Are to the <HI>tender,</HI> confirmations &s;trong</L>
<L>As proofs of holy writ!&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>And as he was repeating this, he drew from his wai&s;tcoat pocket a piece of paper, which being opened, unfolded to our view that very little portrait, of precious memory, which the reader will remember has already been di&s;tingui&s;hed in this hi&s;tory.
<PB N="97" REF="104">Take it, Mrs. Sudberry, &s;aid he, pre|&s;enting the bracelet&mdash;take the image of your hu&s;band, which I have re&s;|cued from the arm of the ravi&s;her; for I do a&s;&s;ure you it was in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lady. You mu&s;t know, madam, as I pa&s;&s;ed by the taylor's door ju&s;t now, when I was obliged to leave you upon bu&s;ine&s;s, I dropped in upon the ra&s;cal, and was determined to tell him a piece of my mind. It happened that he opened the door him&s;elf, and I drew him into a room by his neckcloth, which was by no means &s;o pale as his face: and &s;o ma&s;ter Skain, &s;aid I to him, we are to have the felicity of &s;eeing you <HI>tuck'd up</HI> at la&s;t. You have &s;et up your car|riage to a plea&s;ant purpo&s;e; and for the dignity of your profe&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall
<PB N="98" REF="105">make all po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t that you may be permitted to go by &s;o gented an untaylorly a conveyance, to the place of execution. For God's &s;ake what do you mean? cried the taylor. Mean, &s;ir, &s;aid I, that you have de|frauded a gentleman of his property, taken in pawns without a licence, obtained &s;ecurity for your money&mdash; overcharged your account &mdash; (this I added, to make the &s;ound more pom|pous) mo&s;t unwarrantably, and not contented with goods, have taken body into the bargain: the picture, Mr. Skain, the picture.&mdash;The teeth of the di&s;a&s;trous taylor chattered mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly, and to cut &s;hort all trifling, I thus went on, fir&s;t taking a certain written paper out of my pocket. Lookee, Skain, thy <HI>hand,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="106">which was lately laid &s;o heavy on Mr. Sudberry (the in&s;ulted &s;tranger who&s;e cau&s;e I e&s;pou&s;ed), is now turned again&s;t thy&s;elf: this is your writing &mdash;this your name, the &s;um is nine|teen hundred and twenty pounds&mdash; the note is made payable to order&mdash;it is long pa&s;t its date, and now in the hands of a re&s;olute and angry man: pay it on this demand&mdash;or gue&s;s the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted Mr. Sudberry, at the ba&s;ene&s;s of this &s;hred of &s;hal|loon, that I may <HI>now</HI> tell you, the only bu&s;ine&s;s I had to leave your good company, was to mortify, di&s;grace, and puni&s;h the &s;coundrel who had in|jured you;&mdash;no bowing and lifting up of hands and eyes, pr'ythee: it was more a &s;elfi&s;h than &s;ocial undertaking,
<PB N="100" REF="107">I promi&s;e you: for if you have my ideas of happine&s;s, you will think the high-reli&s;hed tran&s;port of bringing a villain to &s;hame, and probing him to the heart, by pre&s;enting a Rowland for his Oliver, is payment in full, for all its delightful con&s;equences, even though they &s;hould render a whole city happy. That this recrimination might be the more glorious, and the more triumphant, I po&s;ted away to my friend Spangle's&mdash;the gentleman you &s;aw this morning, Benignus, and telling him the circum&s;tances, but con|cealing the names, I engaged him very ea&s;ily in my &s;cheme, which I could indeed, with the &s;ame facility have done, had I propo&s;ed &s;etting fire to the metropolis, and beginning the blaze in the bed-chamber of his wife.</P>

<P>As Mr. Draper pronounced the la&s;t &s;entence, Mr. and Mrs. Sudberry a|gain exchanged glances, which the keen eye of our young gentleman perceiving, he thus continued his nar|rative. Lookee there now, did I not tell you &s;o before&mdash;did I not in&s;i&s;t upon it Mr. Sudberry was not an un|fortunate man? This very Spangle has an immen&s;e e&s;tate, yet is without &s;ix pennyworth of under&s;tanding&mdash;he has a child which he don't care a far|thing for, and does not &s;uffer it to &s;it upon his knee, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;oil his cloaths; and hates his wife with all
<PB N="102" REF="109">his heart. Which is the happie&s;t fa|mily, Benignus?</P>
<P>Before I had time to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, which Mr. Draper &s;ubmitted to me, Mrs. Sudberry left her &s;eat, pre&s;&s;ed the picture to her bo&s;om, but threw her eyes, full of tender fire, at the original, be&s;towed a ki&s;s upon every child, and then came again, blu&s;hing beauty, to her chair. Lord, Benignus, re&s;umed Draper, what poor &s;olitary things we &s;ingle fellows are! But to fini&s;h the taylor.</P>
<P>Spangle, I knew, had long ago, at my interce&s;&s;ion, lent Mr. Skain the above &s;um, to make up the purcha&s;e money of an e&s;tate, for which the avaricious taylor was then in treaty; and though I &s;uppo&s;ed the fellow could pay the note he gave Spangle,
<PB N="103" REF="110">yet I imagined it would di&s;tre&s;s him to take him unprovided, e&s;pecially as he took Spangle to be an ea&s;y man, whom he could manage as he plea&s;ed. Spangle was in&s;tantly convinced of the infamy of Skain, tho' I could have made him as &s;trongly convinced of his being a very hone&s;t man; for, as I ob&s;erved before to you, he is the weake&s;t of all weak creatures, while he thinks him&s;elf the wi&s;e&s;t. He gave the note, to my care and di&s;po&s;al. I left him to his looking-gla&s;&s;es, and drove to our friend Dodge's, in com|pany with whom I went to take out a writ, and order the bailiff to &s;tand at the corner of a &s;treet, within call, that he might do his duty.</P>
<P>Mr. Dodge was on guard, in this po&s;t of honour, during my debate with Mr. Skain, who no &s;ooner &s;aw
<PB N="104" REF="111">into my drift, than he fell upon his knees in great agony, and begged for the &s;ake of his family, that I would &s;tay a few days, till he could borrow the money on his e&s;tates, earne&s;tly vowing he had not a hundred and fifty gui|neas in the hou&s;e, and that an impro|per &s;tep would ruin his credit, and <HI>blow up</HI> his character, and <HI>knock up</HI> his trade, and <HI>&s;hut up</HI> his &s;hop for ever. The officer, &s;ir, &s;aid I, is at hand.&mdash; An officer! exclaimed he, with incon|ceivable te&s;timonies of horror, while the hair clearly lifted up his cap, which &s;till covered it&mdash;an officer!&mdash; here I am, a mi&s;erable wretch, who has kept hou&s;e the&s;e &s;eventeen years, in which time I have arre&s;ted more than &s;eventy men, and yet never had a writ at my back before. The only
<PB N="105" REF="112">parchment I ever handled was my mea&s;ure: but you won't be &s;o inhu|man as to arre&s;t me, Mr. Draper?&mdash; You won't &s;end a man of property to jail, before he can turn round&mdash;you won't murder and mangle, and ma&s;|&s;acre my &s;oul and body at once, for the &s;ake of revenge, which is the devil&mdash;I'm &s;ure you won't. Where's the picture, I &s;ay, fellow, exclaimed 1. While I was making this de|mand, the violent roarings, and di&s;|tracted vociferation of Skain, emp|tied the aerial apartments, and brought in upon me eight ludicrous figures, in their &s;hirts. In a word, madam, the journeymen taylors had all left their board, which was fixed in the garret, and came to &s;ee what could po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion &s;uch pathetic
<PB N="106" REF="113">and piercing exclamations. Each man, in the confu&s;ion, brought &s;omething characteri&s;tic in his hand. One pre|&s;ented to view the half of a wai&s;tcoat, another the &s;houlder and &s;leeve of a coat&mdash;&s;ome were armed with imple|ments of offence. This gra&s;ped a goo&s;e,&mdash;this brandi&s;hed a tremendous pair of &s;heers, and that wielded a needle. I drew my &s;word, a corking pin would have an&s;wered the &s;ame end, and kept them at bay.&mdash;The tay|lor in chief was in an agony, and when he renewed his ravings, he brought down from &s;ome private part of the hou&s;e, a female of no very lovely, though jolly appearance, who &s;allying up to me, with her arms a|kimbo, de&s;ired to know what bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="114">I had to draw my &s;word upon her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>As I knew Mr. Skain always pa&s;&s;ed for a bachelor, and as there was &s;omething wonderfully unlike a wife in this lady, I was preparing a le&s;s gentle reply than &s;he might expect, when Skain prevented me, by ri&s;ing in a great pa&s;&s;ion; di&s;patched his trembling groupe to their work, and demanded of the lady how, in the fir&s;t place, &s;he dared to betray him, by leaving her chamber, which &s;he was <HI>articled</HI> to keep; and, in the &s;e|cond, how &s;he had the impudence to call her&s;elf his wife.&mdash;Sir, &s;aid he&mdash; this is, I find, a day, a cur&s;ed day, in which I am every way to be ruined: my poor character is to be torn to packthreads &mdash; I &s;ee it is&mdash;But fall

Now as I contemplated this mighty action, which I apprehended would be the la&s;t in which our tay|lor would be engaged, I contem|plated likewi&s;e &s;omething el&s;e; for from the arm which properly belong|ed to this &s;tupendous knuckle, &s;lew, in the heat of the battle, with va&s;t violence of rebound, again&s;t my &s;houl|der,

<P>Mr. Dodge, who &s;till maintained his &s;tation, I di&s;charged, telling him I had made up the affair without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and as all this victorious bu&s;ine&s;s was done in little more than an hour&mdash;for you are to under&s;tand, I pique my&s;elf upon di&s;patch&mdash;I think I have a right to &s;hake Mr. Sudberry by the hand, (which thus I do mo&s;t

<P>For my own part, I was the princi|pal figure of &s;till life in the room; for, being &s;o earne&s;t a li&s;tener and ob&s;erver, and the elegant Mr. Draper leaving
<PB N="111" REF="118">nothing for me to &s;ay or do, I &s;at &s;ilent and a&s;toni&s;hed, a mere cypher of curio&s;ity and &s;urprize.</P>
<P>The footman now entered, pre&s;ent|ing a card, which requiring an an&s;wer, Mr. Draper begged permi&s;&s;ion to with|draw, for five minutes, to his writ|ing-table, and at the &s;ame time &s;aying the card concerned me likewi&s;e, took me out with him; and then, as he got to the door, familiarly &s;aid, you'll get us a cup of coffee, Mrs. Sudberry; you know I am a per&s;on of di&s;patch, and I &s;hall be with you and your good man again, in the melting of a lump of &s;ugar, &s;o pour away as fa&s;t as you will.</P>
<P>By this time, my adoration was &s;o extreme for Draper, that it was almo&s;t grown on the other &s;ide idolatry; and
<PB N="112" REF="119">as I followed him along the pa&s;&s;age that led from the dining room, I could have ki&s;&s;ed, with real reverence, the hem of his garment. We &s;topped at the door of an apartment, at the back part of the hou&s;e, where, taking me by the hand, and opening the door, he introduced me into a room, which was wain&s;coted with looking-gla&s;&s;es, and to a lovely young lady, who was entertaining her&s;elf at the harp&s;ichord; &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting di&s;habille that could po&s;&s;ibly be con|ceived &mdash; her face was one of tho&s;e which di&s;compo&s;e the &s;oul, and flut|ters the pul&s;e the moment it is be|held, and her glo&s;&s;y hair came &s;port|ing down her right &s;houlder, in the mo&s;t voluptuous abundance. She ro&s;e nimbly from her &s;eat, as we came in,
<PB N="113" REF="120">and began to chide; while Draper gave her, without any prelude of ce|remony, a hearty ki&s;s; and with an air of negligent &s;uperiority, led her to a chair, and then carele&s;sly drew an|other, and placed it by her: And how, Pri&s;cilla, cried he, tapping her on the check&mdash;how could&s;t thou be &s;o im|patient a &s;impleton as to &s;end for me &mdash;let me &s;ee, how was it? Here he took out the card and read:&mdash;"Pri&s;|cilla's compliments to Mr. Draper, and if he is not more agreeably en|gaged, will be happy to &s;peak with him." Upon my word, Mi&s;s Pri&s;|cilla, a very laconic well-worded card! and now Mr. Draper is come, what would&s;t thou &s;ay to him? For Hea|ven's &s;ake, Benignus, be &s;eated; my wife, as the taylor &s;ays, will excu&s;e
<PB N="114" REF="121">my introducing a friend, even though I did not announce his coming by a <HI>card.</HI> Well, but Pri&s;s; tell me at once what you want, becau&s;e I have but five minutes to &s;pare. Pray who is that <HI>married</HI> lady, Mr. Draper, cried Pri&s;cilla, in a &s;ly tone, you are &s;o merry with? Lookee, Pri&s;s, &s;aid Dra|per, gravely, no taunts, no &s;neers: whoever I think proper to introduce into this hou&s;e, are, while they are in it, people of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, in my eye: remember I never &s;uffer reflections, nor enter into characters <HI>here.</HI> Nay, an&s;wered the lady, I only a&s;ked a civil que&s;tion, as Mr. Tho|mas told me &s;he &s;eemed a very young woman to have &s;uch a parcel of chil|dren, and&mdash;Oh ho, an&s;wered Dra|per, without the lea&s;t emotion, Mr.
<PB N="115" REF="122">Thomas told you, did he? That's quite a different matter: pray, Be|nignus, &s;hall I trouble you to touch that bell? Is your in&s;trument in tune, Pri&s;s? Perhaps you will oblige my friend with a &s;ong, and &s;uppo&s;e you indulge us with&mdash;a&mdash;Oh, Thomas, (here Thomas entered) your year is up to-morrow, I think?&mdash;Yes, &s;ir, &s;aid Thomas, turning pale, and Pri&s;cilla paler &s;till.&mdash;Well then, you will put up your luggage with all convenient expedition, and here&mdash;here&mdash;are your wages, and a guinea extra for the favour of your moving off to night. On my knees I intreat you, my dear Draper, &s;aid the lady, with the tears in her eyes, to&mdash;to&mdash;As I have a &s;oul to peri&s;h, &s;ir, an&s;wered Thomas, I have done nothing to my know|ledge
<PB N="116" REF="123">which&mdash;Pr'ythee go away man, I don't accu&s;e you of any thing&mdash;but I am in the humour to change, &s;aid Mr. Draper, that's all. Nay then, &s;aid the lady, and if you come to that, &s;o am I, &s;ir!&mdash;Are you? replied Draper, with amazing coolne&s;s.&mdash;You know I hold it &s;inful to baulk one's rea&s;onable inclinations&mdash;&s;o my dear, pretty Pri&s;cilla, accept this fooli&s;h piece of paper (he gave her a bank|bill, I know not of what value); ac|cept it as a token; and if you &s;hould not again alter your mind, &s;uppo&s;e me now taking my la&s;t adieu. Mr. Draper again rang the bell, and bow|ing with great civility, as he went towards the door, went out with as much placidity as he came in. We met another &s;ervant at the head of the
<PB N="117" REF="124">&s;tairs; take care, Kit, &s;aid Mr. Dra|per to him, that I am no more <HI>di&s;turb|ed;</HI> and if Pricilla wants the chair, or any me&s;&s;ages, you will obey her commands. Having &s;aid this, he gave me a gentle &s;lap on the &s;houlder, crying, "So much for that, ma&s;ter Brooke," and went &s;miling, with the air of perfect peace, into the dining|room.</P>

<P>Of this la&s;t tran&s;action, I could make neither head nor tail; &s;o re|&s;olved for the pre&s;ent to plague my|&s;elf no more about it; e&s;pecially as I found the company in the &s;ame agree|able di&s;po&s;ition in which we left it:
<PB N="118" REF="125">but yet the &s;ituation of the parties were &s;omething varied, for Mr. and Mrs. Sudberry were both &s;itting upon the &s;opha; Sudberry was livelier than ever, and his lady met us with &s;o grateful a &s;mile, that to have come a moment &s;ooner, or later, would have methought been a moment out of time. Strange, however, as it may &s;eem, Mrs. Sudberry had forgot to order the coffee, and when Draper gently reproached her for being &s;o bad a hou&s;ewife, one of tho&s;e unde&s;cribable blu&s;hes painted her cheek, and height|ened the natural ro&s;es of her com|plexion, which the poetical Dr. Donne has called <HI>eloquent.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Her pure and <HI>eloquent</HI> blood</L>
<L>Spoke in her cheeks, and &s;o di&s;tinctly wrought,</L>
<L>That one might almo&s;t &s;ay, her body thought.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="119" REF="126">
The tea-table was, however, &s;oon furni&s;hed, at Mr. Draper's &s;ummons; and Mrs. Sudberry's blu&s;h gradually di&s;appeared, till it &s;ettled only into the bloom, which was always &s;miling on her cheek.</P>
<P>Mr. Sudberry, who hitherto had &s;aid little, on account of his di&s;order, which &s;peaking generally increa&s;ed, having, as the tea-equipage was re|moving, &s;ome intention to take his leave, began to return the proper te&s;|timonies of re&s;pect to his benefactor.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid he, bowing to Mr. Dra|per, you have probably &s;aved me from that death in a <HI>pri&s;on,</HI> which, though I know it cannot long be <HI>any where</HI> prevented, would in &s;uch a &s;i|tuation be doubly terrible. You have, at the &s;ame time, re&s;cued from di&s;|traction,
<PB N="120" REF="127">this tender creature; and, from a more <HI>&s;udden</HI> poverty, the&s;e beautiful babes. Unle&s;s you could &s;ee my heart, you will not be able to conceive its con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. Apologies for having been the means of making a <HI>man</HI> act like an <HI>angel,</HI> is rather an in|&s;ult than a compliment. What you did, I am &s;ure you <HI>felt,</HI> and that feel|ing, while it ble&s;&s;es <HI>us,</HI> rewards you: happy, indeed, are they who are the objects of &s;uch benevolence: <HI>happier</HI> only he, who is ma&s;ter of the &s;en&s;a|tion which in&s;pired it. In gratitude, (&mdash;here he put his hand on his brea&s;t) there is <HI>much</HI> joy,&mdash;In liberality, (he looked re&s;pectfully at Mr. Draper) there is &s;till <HI>more;</HI> and <HI>we</HI> hold, &s;ir, the &s;econd place of felicity, as <HI>receivers</HI> of benefits; that you may hold the
<PB N="121" REF="128">fir&s;t, as the per&s;on who <HI>conferred</HI> them, &mdash;He pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>My &s;tars and garters! cried Mr. Draper, what a pity it is, Sudberry, you and I are &s;trangers! What a deal of &s;entiment might you &s;ave (and I &s;ee you talk in &s;ome pain, and upon my &s;oul, you give me as much pain to hear you talk) if you did but know that I am &s;o &s;incere a de&s;pi&s;er of all formality, that I never &s;uffer a &s;lip of buckram, even in my coat. I heard that you were in&s;ulted, and, for the want of a few &s;coundrel guineas, un|able to redre&s;s your&s;elf. Now, in|&s;ult I am &s;o far from bearing my|&s;elf, that I cannot endure it &s;hould be in&s;ticted on another. If you had a pur&s;e in your pocket, a &s;word at your &s;ide, and a cane in your hand: if,
<PB N="122" REF="129">&s;ir, Providence had thought proper to accoutre you in this manner, I &s;hould have left you to revenge your own cau&s;e, and fight your own battles: and had you he&s;itated to do this, under &s;uch advantages, I &s;hould have rejoiced to hear, that the pur&s;e had been taken from you, the &s;word run through your body, and the cane laid acro&s;s your &s;houlders: becau&s;e, for <HI>man</HI> to fear <HI>man,</HI> in my idea, is the la&s;t error of idolatry, and ten times a greater &s;hame, than bowing the knee to Baal. But I heard you were without arms, I heard you were &s;ick, married, had children, and was no &s;harper: becau&s;e you was a &s;tranger, and becau&s;e you were de&s;titute, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted you. In that a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have gratified my darling pa&s;&s;ions: I
<PB N="123" REF="130">I have at the time &s;erved one gentle|man in di&s;tre&s;s, and Oh, good God of Heaven, Sudberry, what an idea! &mdash;I have puni&s;hed <HI>three</HI> &s;coundrels! So, pr'ythee now, don't pur&s;ue the cur&s;ed &s;ubject of acknowledgment. I take it for granted, your little affairs at home are in &s;ome di&s;order; and, therefore, I will not prevent your putting them to rights: your chil|dren too I &s;ee begin to rub their eyes, and I can conceive, bachelor as I am, the wi&s;hes of you all. Without any parade, therefore, get into my coach, or, if you like it better, a hackney coach, and tell me, in a word, what will make matters <HI>thoroughly ea&s;y</HI> till this day fe'nnight, when I chal|lenge every one of you to a haunch of veni&s;on. Lookee, now, what can
<PB N="124" REF="131">one do! Your wife is in tears, again &mdash;There&mdash;there&mdash;then&mdash;it can be no wor&s;e, and &s;o, for God's &s;ake, put this into your pocket, and call me when you have done crying.</P>

<P>Mr. Draper was hurrying away, when one of the children caught him by the hand, and enchantingly cried, You be good gentemin, and mu&s;t not leave my dear papa and mamma. They only cry for your goodne&s;s, and cry becau&s;e they be full of glad, not &s;orry. Oh, my angel, replied the mother, &s;o we do, &s;o we do; your poor papa would have died if it had
<PB N="125" REF="132">not been for the kindne&s;s of that gentlemen&mdash;Would he? an&s;wered the child, than papa mu&s;t now live to thank him, that's all&mdash;I live to thank him, too, &s;aid the &s;econd. Me vil kneel down thus, and pray God Mighty love him for it, li&s;ped out the younge&s;t, throwing it&s;elf at the &s;ame time on the carpet, and folding its hands. Murder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination! exclaimed Draper, &s;tamping and draw|ing his handkerchief over his face&mdash; there's no &s;tanding this. You are re|&s;olved to kill me, I think, in my own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Come hither, &s;aid I, come hither, thou beautiful little tyrant&mdash;I was going to relieve Draper from the em|braces of the child, when Sudberry him&s;elf ro&s;e, and walking, as well as
<PB N="126" REF="133">his weakne&s;s would let him, towards Mr. Draper, he &s;aid, Well, &s;ir, we have tortured you &s;ufficiently; 'tis time to give you re&s;pite; with your permi&s;&s;ion, we will now &s;end for a coach. I &s;ee perfectly into your cha|racter, and will not refu&s;e the plea|&s;ures it brings me. Come, Mrs. Sud|berry, let us now wi&s;h Mr. Draper good night, and leave him, with a promi&s;e to partake of his veni&s;on. It is only from the &s;carcity of good men, that makes us awkward when we receive their favours. Mr. Draper happens to perform the purpo&s;es for which he was born, and finds, in &s;uch performance, the &s;ame plea&s;ure you do in ki&s;&s;ing your children. 'Tis in both&mdash;the in&s;piration of nature. Fare|well then, &s;ir,&mdash;indulge your con&s;ti|tation,
<PB N="127" REF="134">and I rejoice to find its ten|dencies &s;o favourable to my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid Draper, you talk to the purpo&s;e; and if you have now the wi&s;dom to &s;ay no more, all will be as it ought to be. I have done, an&s;wer|ed Sudberry. Then art thou, in my e&s;timation, more eloquent than Ci|cero on the &s;ubject, replied Draper.</P>
<P>You are both (thought I) very cle|ver fellows, for ought I &s;ee to the contrary; but what &s;ort of a being I mu&s;t appear to you, I really cannot tell; for here have I been witne&s;s to a train of actions, enough to make a devil catch &s;ome &s;park of the divini|ty; and yet from the fir&s;t moment to the la&s;t, I have not done one farthing&s;|worth of good, nor one farthing&s; worth
<PB N="128" REF="135">of harm. This Draper carries it all before him, and leaves his friend no opportunity to do a tolerable thing, with any degree of grace. He is the independent &s;ub&s;tantive, and I the &s;curvy adjective. No matter&mdash;it may be my turn to &s;tand in a better light to-morrow.&mdash;At pre&s;ent, I am only in &s;hadow.</P>
<P>I made the&s;e reflections, while the coach was &s;ent for, and when it came, Draper handed the family into it, with the &s;ame politene&s;s he handed them out of the other, ki&s;&s;ed his hand to them, as the driver was wheeling from the door, and returned with me into his hou&s;e.</P>

<P>Is Pri&s;s at home? &s;aid Mr. Draper, to a &s;ervant, as he went in; No, &s;ir, an&s;wered the &s;ervant, &s;he ordered Thomas to fetch a hackney coach, directed Su&s;an to pack up her things, and ordered the coachman to carry her into Piccadilly. Very well, re|plied Draper (not at all di&s;compo&s;ed), get the chariot to the door, and bid Crimpa come and tie up my hair. Then turning to me; And now my dear Benignus let us go and fight it out with the women, for Mrs. Dar|lington, notwith&s;tanding our me&s;&s;age, will give it us, I promi&s;e you; &s;he is the very pink of punctilio, you know.
<PB N="130" REF="137">Oh, here comes Crimpa. Crimpa, draw thy comb through my hair in a moment: and while he is doing this excruciating piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uppo&s;e we amu&s;e our&s;elves with examining my friend Spangle's pocket book; Crimpa is mo&s;t conveniently &s;tupid, and will not comprehend a &s;yllable about the matter. Here, Benignus, here it is,&mdash;open and communicate the precious contents.&mdash;I he&s;itated to open the lock, which Draper per|ceiving, took it out of my hands, with a &s;ort of contemptuous jerk, and &s;aying, Lock, by your leave, did the bu&s;ine&s;s in a moment, and carele&s;sly turning over the leaves, thus prefaced his peru&s;al of them.</P>
<P>I have already told you, Benignus, my notion of modern delicacy; I think
<PB N="131" REF="138">we are wrong both in the theory and practice. I can be as &s;erious, and as merry, as any man in Europe; but then my mirth is frequently excited by the&mdash;Damn this Crimpa, how con|foundedly he tortures my head&mdash;my mirth, I was going to ob&s;erve, is of|ten excited, by the very object which occa&s;ions &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s is another; and this, upon my honour, not from af|fectation of &s;ingularity, but from temper, and the mere make of my mind. I always follow every agree|able feeling, and am directed by one uniform principle of gratification. The malicious pa&s;&s;ions &s;hake a man all to pieces, &s;et his pul&s;es a fluttering, and every way render him di&s;agreeable to him&s;elf. The gentle and pacific pa&s;|&s;ions, on the contrary, diffu&s;e &s;uch a
<PB N="132" REF="139">fine &s;oothing &s;et of &s;en&s;ations over both &s;oul and body, that while one can any way indulge them, at what|ever expence, they afford an ely&s;ium &s;o infinitely plea&s;ing, that I would purcha&s;e them, though I &s;hould buy gratification ever &s;o extravagantly. Thus I am the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h fellow in the kingdom; and cur&s;e me if I be|lieve &s;uch characters have the lea&s;t merit in any of their actions. Your &s;ly hypocritical dogs &s;ink all the&s;e kind of things upon you, as pure efforts of benevolence; but I who hate &s;trutting it in the plume of an|other, a&s;&s;ure you 'tis con&s;titution, and downright love of plea&s;ure; nay, &s;ometimes 'tis the mere impromptu of the moment.&mdash;We are &s;ometimes in a di&s;po&s;ition to be delighted with
<PB N="133" REF="140">opening our pur&s;e, and &s;ometimes with drawing it avariciou&s;ly together. One object attacks us at the fortunate cri&s;is, and we give him every thing he wants. Another &s;hall perhaps meet us at the corner of the next &s;treet, equally indigent, and yet &s;o far from giving him that which he wants, we reproach him for having the impudence to tender his petition. Pr'ythee go along, fellow, and don't plague me&mdash;I have nothing for thee. Such our language to the one.&mdash;Yes, poor creature&mdash;take my pittance, let it alleviate the nece&s;&s;ities which I perceive pre&s;s heavily upon thee&mdash; Thou art welcome to my &s;uperfluity, and much, very much good may it do thee. Such our &s;entiments to the other. Whence the&s;e di&s;tinctions&mdash;
<PB N="134" REF="141">whence the&s;e partialities? Why, they originate from nature; we are mi&s;er|able as mi&s;ers, or bountiful as angels, ju&s;t as we are in the humour: for man is the mo&s;t whim&s;ical of all crea|tures. Now, I'll lay my life, the poor Sudberrys&mdash;(this fellow is neat as im|ported, and does not under&s;tand a word of Engli&s;h)&mdash;are gone away under the fallacious idea of &s;uppo&s;ing me the mo&s;t generous man in the world, when all I have done would certainly have been avoided, had <HI>their</HI> conve|nience alone been con&s;ulted.

<P>Now with re&s;pect to this pocket|book. 'Tis the property of a cox|comb, who has not a dram of feeling in his whole frame: one of my great con&s;titutional plea&s;ures is, to expo&s;e and laugh at &s;uch a wretch.

If this pocket-book was yours, or poor Sud|berry's, it might po&s;&s;ibly contain &s;omething rational, and &s;hould there|fore, for me, be &s;acred from viola|tion: but being Spangle's, whom I know, better than he knows him&s;elf, and who never kept a &s;ecret &s;ince he had tongue enough to tell it&mdash;being his, my dear Benignus, why, here beginneth the fir&s;t chapter of folly.

<P>Here Draper, after a moment's pau&s;e, to&s;&s;ed the book into the middle of the room, and exclaimed as he ro&s;e from under the hand of his va|let:&mdash;Aye, its all alike I &s;ee. Infa|mous ra&s;cal: he has not ingenuity enough to &s;upport the character of which he is ambitious. The narrative of his day, is the narrative of his life.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;aid I, Mr. Draper is all this con&s;titution &mdash; did nature ever form &s;uch a reptile as Spangle? Art and na|ture,
<PB N="142" REF="149">in conjunction, an&s;wered Dra|per, &s;ettling his &s;tock at the gla&s;s, have made a million &s;uch, and I am glad I have &s;hewn you the in&s;ide of the fellow's brains, that you may pity and de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Curious were the particulars which flew from the pocket-book, about the room. Locks of hair, papers of paint, letters, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and tooth-picks, &s;cat|tered in confu&s;ion. Crimpa took them up, and Mr. Draper put them loo&s;e in his pocket, as he was going to the chariot, &s;olemnly declaring, that he would fir&s;t read them to Spangle's wife, before Spangle him|&s;elf, and then &s;tand over the ra&s;|cal, while he directed them in a parcel to the poor devoted Diana Dickens, which it &s;eems was the name of the young lady whom he torment|ed
<PB N="143" REF="150">at the chapel:&mdash;for, &s;ays he, tho' I am no enemy to gallantry, I am to brutality; and &s;uch a fellow &s;hould never ri&s;e to a greater dignity of amour, than an affair with a cinder|wench.</P>
<P>We mounted the carriage, and Dra|per &s;at biting his nails, and angrily twi&s;ting the gla&s;s ta&s;&s;els, as if he was the mo&s;t rigid reformer of the age, every now and then vehemently re|peating d&mdash;nation&mdash;I love gallantry, but de&s;pi&s;e brutality.</P>
<P>To <HI>me,</HI> the world already wore a new face, and contained &s;cenes and characters, which a few weeks before I was utterly uncon&s;cious of. Nor let the reader, in this place, laugh at the ignorance of my youth: for thou|&s;ands are there, at this minute, in
<PB N="144" REF="151">country, who, arrived to their three|&s;core and tenth year, are perfectly un|acquainted that &s;o much villainy exi&s;ts in human nature, as I have delineated in le&s;s than three&s;core pages. Nay, &s;uch is &s;till the hone&s;t &s;implicity of tho&s;e at a di&s;tance from the metro|polis, that if at my return to my vil|lage, I &s;hould tell them, of an elegant looking lady dead drunk in the &s;treets; of a fop who lays the plan of a young woman's de&s;truction in a church; of a taylor who keeps a mi&s;|tre&s;s, a chariot, and a black footman, with a &s;ilver &s;houlder knot; of a parcel of fellows who lay watching for the body of a &s;ick man, with a wife and three children, like &s;o many many dogs at a door; and of a per|&s;on who is &s;uch a mi&s;cellany of vice
<PB N="145" REF="152">and virtue, defect and excellence, as Mr. Draper.&mdash;If, I &s;ay, I were to tell the&s;e things&mdash;or if haply they are ever peru&s;ed in print, by people who have never mixed among the poli&s;hed errors of a large city&mdash;will they not &s;et me down as an ill-natured di&s;con|tented fellow, who have drawn a very unfair, as well as a very ugly picture of life? Such an accu&s;ation would re|dound &s;o much to the honour of the accu&s;ers, that I cannot find it in my heart to upbraid them. To &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for any of the &s;pecies to be &s;o de&s;titute of humanity, as I have been, and &s;hall &s;till be, obliged here and there to repre&s;ent them, is a &s;up|po&s;ition which argues &s;ome innocence in the &s;uppo&s;er; and whenever the reader thinks I indulge in the gloom
<PB N="146" REF="153">of imagination, I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h he may never have the mortification to experience that I have only di&s;|played to his eye the real portrait of human manners.</P>

<P>Fine truants, indeed! &s;aid Alicia, as &s;oon as we entered the parlour. Well, gentlemen, cries Mrs. Darlington, you have &s;tayed out methinks. I have ju&s;t brought Benignus to the door, ladies, an&s;wered Mr. Draper, that you might not fear I had quite run away with him: it has been a day of ad|venture, and now, though I love dearly to hear you make enquiries
<PB N="147" REF="154">about the who, and the what, and the where, and the when, the where|fore, and the why; yet I am obliged in&s;tantly to deprive my&s;elf of this felicity, by an engagement which mu&s;t this in&s;tant be fulfilled: &s;o I mu&s;t leave Benignus to tell the &s;tory,&mdash;you que&s;tion, and he an&s;wer, and rob my|&s;elf of one of the &s;weete&s;t entertain|ments in the world.

<PB N="149" REF="156">to peru&s;e the&s;e books, it will not, in their opinion, redound much to my credit, or in&s;pire them with any re&s;|pectable ideas of my under&s;tanding, that I continued &s;o long in town, without making the lea&s;t enquiry into my affairs, not &s;o much, or rather &s;o little, as even to call or &s;end more than a &s;ingle card to the attorney, to who&s;e care were entru&s;ted, not only the papers of my family, but through who&s;e hands my guardian had been u&s;ed to receive letters from time to time, on the very intere&s;ting &s;ubjects of ri&s;e and fall, &s;ell out, and buy in, cent per cent. with all that never ending et cetera of prudential and pecuniary policies, which &s;o delight|fully agitate men of property. To all &s;uch, be it known, that I candidly
<PB N="150" REF="157">take &s;hame to my&s;elf; much of this care and circum&s;pection depends on education. The college and the coun|ter &s;o oppo&s;itely affect the imagina|tion, that a few years re&s;idence within the cloy&s;ters of the one, or behind the drawers of the other, give not only contra&s;ted modes of thinking, but make two people (thus differently employed) as utterly unlike, as if one was born to the cu&s;toms of France, and the other to tho&s;e of Turkey. And here I beg leave to add, on this head, the illu&s;tration of a little &s;tory, taken faithfully from the excellent vo|lume of life.</P>
<P>Thomas and John were brothers, and bred up together to the age of &s;ix, in the &s;ame hou&s;e, di&s;covering till about that time, pretty nearly the
<PB N="151" REF="158">&s;ame di&s;po&s;itions: but the father, &s;oon after, de&s;igning one for the church, and one for the counting hou&s;e, Tho|mas was entered a member at one of the univer&s;ities, and John was &s;ituated with a trader in the city. They were both indu&s;trious lads, and made a very promi&s;ing progre&s;s: at the end of about &s;even years, and not before, (&s;uch was their application), they met, on a vi&s;it to their father, who re&s;ided in the country; and in this vi&s;it they &s;oon evinced the wonderful force of practice, and habit, on the human con&s;titution. The ma&s;on who is &s;aid to have carried a brick in his pocket, as a &s;ignal of his trade, was not a more certain te&s;timony, than tho&s;e en&s;igns of office, which our young gentlemen held out to every acquaint|ance.
<PB N="152" REF="159">Their very gait and di&s;cour&s;e was become <HI>profe&s;&s;ional.</HI> Thomas, who had been u&s;ed to &s;aunter through the venerable walks of his college, or &s;lumber beneath a &s;preading oak, with a book by his &s;ide, had acquired from thence an indolent method of walk|ing; and yet, was as &s;tarch, &s;olemn, and perpendicular, as if he had been long treading in the &s;eemly &s;teps o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one of the faithful: while John, on the contrary, in &s;pite of a name, which gives methinks the dulle&s;t idea of any chri&s;tian appellation in our language, had as di&s;patchful a pair of heels, hands, and eyes, as if he had been &s;erving his time among&s;t the expre&s;&s;es, or was runner to a banker. Their dre&s;s was likewi&s;e <HI>ex officio:</HI> Thomas was generally habited in a
<PB N="153" REF="160">&s;uit of raven grey, with &s;tockings corre&s;ponding, and buckles (though &s;ilver) of &s;o mode&s;t, and unpretend|ing a pattern, that they utterly di&s;|carded all the vagaries of the mode; yet were they like every other part of him, prig, prim, prue, and par|&s;only: much again&s;t its natural incli|nation, his hair was tortured into one large &s;emicircular curl, be&s;prent with a little powder, rather in patches than regularly, and formed a methodical arch, from the top of one &s;houlder to the other: his &s;tock was girded &s;tiff in its buckle; and his coat, though it had never been much tormented by the bru&s;h, was by no means out of form; for Thomas, indeed, had &s;o erect a back, that it would not be ea&s;y for his apparel to &s;et in wrinkles.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="161">Now John, who re&s;ided with an eminent merchant (and had always been accu&s;tomed to vi&s;it the 'Change preci&s;ely at one o'clock,) prided him|&s;elf not a little upon a <HI>de&s;habille</HI> in dre&s;s, the rather he u&s;ed to &s;ay, as it di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the mere me|chanical put, who had a bob-wig for the morning, and a bag for the even|ing. He, therefore, rejected a &s;mug ne&s;s which he con&s;idered as below him&s;elf, and critically marked the external difference betwixt the mere drudge of trade, and the gentleman of bu&s;ine&s;s. To accompli&s;h this lat|ter character, he wore &s;uitable ray|ment: his coat, or rather frock, had a lining of &s;ilk, was cut exactly to the mode, and had a genteel proportion of powder &s;pringled between the
<PB N="155" REF="162">&s;houlders, ju&s;t where the carele&s;s club of his hair, loo&s;ely tied with a rib|bon, depended; his wai&s;tcoat was frequently &s;carlet, or crim&s;on, with a very broad binding of figured lace, the more fa&s;hionable, in his opinion, when the nap was gone, and it was about half worn out: his breeches were always of <HI>black</HI> &s;ilk, &s;o much the better if the &s;trap of his knee-buckle hung accidentally, as it were a little loo&s;e: of <HI>white</HI> &s;ilk were his &s;tockings, one of which was generally &s;uffered to wrinkle about the knee, or the in&s;tep: his cravat (half dirty al&s;o) was of white &s;ar&s;net, edged with a nar|row lace, and tied in a negligent bunch under his chin; and to crown the whole, his hat was laced with gold, and worn elegantly oblique.
<PB N="156" REF="163">Thomas paid his compliments of duty to his father, with the mo&s;t cla&s;&s;ical accuracy and deliberation, ar|ticulating and marking by empha&s;is, <HI>every word.</HI> He hoped his e&s;teemed parent enjoyed the beatitude of health, amid the &s;alutiferous gales of the country; ob&s;erved that the an|cients and poets, or vates, (which meant the &s;ame thing) were all lord and eloquent in prai&s;e of rural life, as could be evidenced by reference to their re&s;pective writings, and then proceeded to quotation; and la&s;tly, he &s;aid he expected to pa&s;s a very joyful month in the hou&s;e and country, where he was born, as it would revive in his mind every idea of juvenility, and make him, as it were, live over again tho&s;e days,
<PB N="157" REF="164">which were devoted to the pa&s;times of puerility; the garrulity of the &s;uipling, and the &s;implicity of early exi&s;tence; when, (as Mr. Locke &s;ays) he might be a&s;&s;imulated, in other words, compared, or to &s;toop &s;till lower in phra&s;e, likened to a &s;heet of white paper.</P>
<P>This &s;alutation differed wonderful|ly from the &s;alutation of John, who catching his father carele&s;sly by the hand, and bowing rapidly at the &s;ame time, &s;aid he was glad to &s;ee him wear &s;o well; remarked that the &s;torid cheek was a curio&s;ity on the other &s;ide of St. Paul's, but that bu|&s;ine&s;s was better than a fine com|plexion; and then archly &s;quinting at Thomas, &s;aid, that he perceived &s;tudy was as &s;ore a &s;poiler of the &s;kin
<PB N="158" REF="165">as Lombard-&s;treet; he then &s;aluted his &s;i&s;ters, which Thomas had neg|lected to do, and &s;at happily down, without ceremony. Their old ac|quaintance in the pari&s;h &s;carce knew either, and what is &s;till &s;tranger, they &s;carce knew each each other: tho&s;e who u&s;ed to agree in every thing, could now agree in nothing: indeed, they held &s;carce a &s;ingle tenet, maxine, or &s;entiment, in any &s;ort &s;imilar; and before they had been a fortnight to|gether, each began to entertain a thorough contempt for the other's un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Cur&s;e that Thomas, would John often &s;ay&mdash;What a queer piece of cla&s;ped calf-&s;kin it is! For ever muz|zing over a mu&s;ty book, and yet he drawls like a pari&s;h clerk! Ble&s;s me,
<PB N="159" REF="166">exclaimed frequently Mr. Thomas, what a pro&s;ane, avaricious, yet extra|vagant being, is brother John! fond of gaudy exterior ornament, yet a mere &s;loven, <HI>in mente,</HI> a ca&s;ket, as I may &s;ay, a plated ca&s;ket, without a jewel; and for ever talking of his commodities, and bales, and cen|tums, ducks &s;truck lame in metropo|litan alleys, and the Lord knows what be&s;ides. I much wi&s;h (having about me, as in duty bound, all fraternal feelings) he may turn out a &s;tationary, laudable, con&s;cientious character; for indeed I cannot but &s;u&s;pect the lad's <HI>capacity!</HI></P>
<P>The men of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;aw in John, all the &s;hrewdne&s;s, acutene&s;s, &s;lyne&s;s, cleverne&s;s, and all other <HI>ne&s;&s;es</HI> that promi&s;ed the man of wealth. The
<PB N="160" REF="167">men of letters di&s;covered in Thomas, all the &s;obriety, &s;teadine&s;s, and learn|ing, which denoted an able divine. The friends of John thought &s;lightly of Thomas, while the friends of Tho|mas thought &s;lightly of John; and they &s;oon thought &s;o very flightly of <HI>one another,</HI> that at the end of the month, which had been chiefly em|ployed in debate (each chu&s;ing to &s;up|port his &s;y&s;tem) they departed in high di&s;dain, Thomas to the ta&s;k of con|templation, to Cicero and Cambridge; and John (wi&s;hing Cambridge might be con&s;umed) to gainful mornings, and gay evenings, to the dexterity of trade, and the traffic of Lombard|&s;treet.</P>
<P>And yet each brother made a re&s;|pectable character, Tom &s;igured in the
<PB N="161" REF="168">pulpit, and John was an alderman. To this &s;tory, written for the &s;atis|faction of my mercantile readers, may be added its moral, viz. that their friend Benignus might be a very good kind of a man, aye, and even po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed no mean &s;hare of common &s;en&s;e, (that &s;en&s;e which I knew they weigh again&s;t all the genius and &s;cho|lar&s;hip in the world), although he &s;layed &s;everal weeks in London after the death of his guardian, without paying a vi&s;it to the only per&s;on who could give him any intelligence as to the <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> and true &s;tate of the <HI>need|ful.</HI></P>

<P>I had never &s;een this Mr. Par&s;ons but once in my whole life, and that was in my infancy, when he took the advantage of a vacation to pa&s;s the rece&s;s which that allowed him, till the next term, at my guardian's; who from long intimacy, had &s;o im|plicit an opinion of his integrity, that he committed to his charge tho&s;e mat|ters which re&s;pected the twelve thou|&s;and pounds at intere&s;t. However, in &s;ome mea&s;ure to reconcile my un|pardonable remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, I can a&s;&s;ure my readers of trading complexions, that I &s;at down as &s;oon as I had re|lated the heads of my day's adventures,
<PB N="163" REF="170">to Mrs. Darlington and her niece, leaving out the my&s;terious &s;cene with Draper and Pri&s;cilla, to write an an|&s;wer to, and propo&s;e a meeting, of bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Par&s;ons the very next day. In the mean time, I was not a little anxious to hear about my friend Benjamin, and his uncle; for &s;trange as it &s;eems, Alicia had not yet mentioned either of them. Mr. Abra|hams, however, &s;oon after relieved my &s;u&s;pence, by &s;ending a note, con|taining the&s;e truly characteri&s;tic words.</P>
<P>Abrahams &s;ends comp^ts to &mdash; Benignus, E&s;q.&mdash;Received his favour, &mdash;is overwhelmed with gratitude for <HI>&s;ame.</HI>&mdash;This is &s;ent, (<HI>per</HI> Benjamin) who (as <HI>in duty bound</HI>) by <HI>ditto favour,</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="171">will make acknowledgments.&mdash;Abra|hams begs a line from &mdash; Benignus, E&s;q. by <HI>item</HI> bearer.</P>
<Q>From my office, &s;even o'clock, almo&s;t half pa&s;t, &mdash; Square, Ann. Dom.</Q>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was &s;tepping out to make enquiries, Mr. Benjamin, the <HI>item</HI> bearer pre&s;ented this laconic card, and (continuing to mend of his bruizes) had &s;o &s;pruced and tighted him&s;elf up, that he really looked quite in|tere&s;ting, and the delicate languor which pain and con&s;inement had thrown over his features, only &s;erved to render them more &s;oft and plea&s;ing. As I knew this card was totally de|&s;igned for private peru&s;al, I read it tran&s;iently, and putting it into my
<PB N="165" REF="172">pocket, told Benjamin I &s;hould take an opportunity to ob&s;erve the con|tents, and that it required no other an&s;wer. I &s;aw that the poor fellow's eyes and heart were full, and that he felt the irk&s;omene&s;s of a &s;ituation, in the pre&s;ence of his ladies, which per|mitted no explanations. The quick|&s;ighted Alicia perceived his embar|ra&s;&s;ment, and perhaps imputed it to a very different cau&s;e from the real one: be that as it will, &s;he reddened and whitened &s;everal times, and as the lad went &s;ighing out of the room, &s;he affected to hem and cough vio|lently, and &s;aid &s;he believed &s;ome filthy fly had got into her throat. Notwith&s;tanding the ob&s;truction of the <HI>fly,</HI> however, there was &s;omething in the confu&s;ion of Benjamin, at this
<PB N="166" REF="173">&s;hort interview, whence &s;he derived &s;uch agreeable thoughts, that &s;he ro&s;e into greater gaiety than I had ever &s;een her indulge, &s;prightly as &s;he was; and this was the evening in which &s;he di&s;covered more of her character, and occa&s;ioned by that di&s;covery, a more grave incident than might be expected from a &s;ubject begun with &s;o much good humour.</P>
<P>Now I have ob&s;erved, that it is cu&s;tomary with biographers, to relate revolutions of all &s;orts, with &s;ome little previous ceremony; and as a very great dome&s;tic change of affairs depends on the circum&s;tances now going to be related, I &s;hall e'en con|form to the method of my predece&s;|fors, and communicate this important event in a &s;eparate chapter.</P>

<P>It is an ob&s;ervation of the great Plato, or of &s;ome other famous phi|lo&s;opher, that if a man of perfect benevolence and virtue &s;hould come upon earth, he would be cheated, im|pri&s;oned, &s;courged, and crucified; and upon the whole, more &s;curvily treated, than if he was the &s;lye&s;t hy|pocrite that ever impo&s;ed upon poor &s;implicity. Now, though I am very far from thinking I have any preten|&s;ions to the perfect benevolence of which this author &s;peaks; yet, with|out vanity, I may be allowed to po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient to intitle me to as large
<PB N="168" REF="175">a portion of abu&s;e, and ill-treatment, as if I had been one of the be&s;t men breathing. In the beginning of this narrative, the reader was told the de&s;ign of vi&s;iting London. Since my arrival there, <HI>hitherto,</HI> it &s;o happened, that I rather ob&s;erved the <HI>manners</HI> of men, than made any formal re&s;earches after happine&s;s. The reader is, as yet, only pre&s;ented with the principal ad|ventures of a very <HI>few weeks;</HI> and, as I did not retire from &s;ociety till the thirty-&s;eventh year of my age, am now relating the tran&s;actions which happened &s;o early as in my &s;ixteenth year, and was engaged in the great &s;cene of life all that tedious interval, containing the enterprizes of almo&s;t twenty years, he may be alarmed in|to the dread of never getting to the
<PB N="169" REF="176">end of my book. Let him <HI>not</HI> be alarmed, it is not very probable that I &s;hall live long enough to write my|&s;elf out: nor is it intended to trouble him with a recapitulation of <HI>all</HI> the misfortunes and indignities which brought me here: for that would in|deed be an endle&s;s labour: the prin|cipal pa&s;&s;ages only will be related, and whoever is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, whoever is the fir&s;t traveller after my decea&s;e, will find the manu&s;cript part|ed into &s;o many divi&s;ions, that if he be a &s;kilful editor, he will publi&s;h to the world only ju&s;t as much <HI>at a time,</HI> and ju&s;t &s;uch a quantity, upon <HI>the whole,</HI> as he deems mo&s;t intere&s;ting and mo&s;t in&s;tructive: for whoever reads any part thereof, merely as a book of amu&s;ement, will by no means
<PB N="170" REF="177">promote the great moral end with which a man, now langui&s;hing in a fore&s;t, undertakes it.

<P>Mrs. Darlington's niece was a great &s;cribbler; and though her pa&s;&s;ion for Benjamin, and her &s;truggles to &s;ub|due that pa&s;&s;ion had made her of late take little delight in her cu&s;tomary amu&s;ements, yet now that &s;he con|ceived &s;ome flattering hopes from the confu&s;ion of that young fellow, that &s;he had kindled a flame in his brea&s;t, without having betrayed the fire in her own, (for to &s;ome &s;uch circum|&s;tance as this I impute her pre&s;ent
<PB N="171" REF="178">high &s;pirits) &s;he began again to in|dulge her favourite plea&s;ures of <HI>pen|woman&s;hip;</HI> and &s;oon after the lad had left the room, told me &s;he was over|head and ears in debt, and was now going to pay all off at once, and then a&s;ked me if I did not love letter-writing. I told her, in reply, that I loved read|ing and compo&s;ition pa&s;&s;ionately, but that I had as yet few corre&s;pondents, and therefore few occa&s;ions to write letters. Oh gracious and gemini! (an|&s;wered this voluble girl) now that is to me altogether amazing.&mdash;Of all things in the world, I love writing, next to that I love talking, and next to that riding round the Parks. Oh, my &s;tars and garters, and blue rib|bons! What a rapture there is in &s;ending and receiving long letters.
<PB N="172" REF="179">When you go into the country, Be|nignus, you &s;hall po&s;itively &s;end to me every po&s;t: you &s;hall indeed. Here &s;he took out her pocket-book; Let me &s;ee (penciling) the letter <HI>B</HI>&mdash; B. B. B. where are you B&mdash; (turning over the leaves) Oh, here it is. Mon|day, Tue&s;day, Wedne&s;day, Thur&s;day, Friday, Saturday, and &s;o forth (read|ing very fa&s;t) debtor, creditor, <HI>et cetera.</HI> Where, Benignus, &s;hall I find a place for you. I am afraid there's no va|cancy&mdash;Stay, &s;tay, Monday&mdash;(&s;he now began again) Monday&mdash;Mi&s;s Flarriet, Mi&s;s Scribble, Mrs. Muzzlethought, and Mr. Moral. Po&s;t comes in at three. Tue&s;day: Sir Billy Scrawl|blot, lady Lovequill, lady Sarah Dun|taxit, and Olivia Split&s;en&s;e. Po&s;t at &s;even in the evening. Wedne&s;day:

No, no room I &s;ee, at pre&s;ent, cou&s;in: my hands, you &s;ee, are quite full; not a &s;ingle moment unoccupied, and yet not a packet di&s;patched &s;ince you came to town.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he thought proper to &s;top, I expre&s;&s;ed my concern that &s;he could not &s;ind a corner for me; to which &s;he bri&s;kly an&s;wered, Nay, Benignus, don't be unea&s;y, for if you will pardon my &s;ometimes &s;ending away the po&s;t without a letter for you, and will accept of a &s;crawl ju&s;t as I can &s;teal time from my old en|gagements&mdash;I &s;ay, in that ca&s;e, I will
<PB N="174" REF="181">joyfully enroll you in the catalogue; what think you of this? May I &s;et you down upon the&s;e familiar terms? By all means, I accept them very thankfully, &s;aid I. There then, cries &s;he (writing) I have &s;et you down as a now-and-then friend &mdash; Lookee. Here you are, Benignus, the Occa|&s;ionali&s;t. But good-bye for half an hour (continued &s;he, looking at her watch), the po&s;t is come in, and I mu&s;t go and &s;ee what it has brought me; for I expect to be well huffed by every creature that writes to me. My aunt knows I never was half &s;o idle in my life: well, your &s;ervant, I &s;hall be down with you at &s;upper. Adieu, aunt, farewell Occa&s;ionali&s;t.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation was run off as rapidly as the tongue could po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="175" REF="182">roll it on the ear; and at the end of it, &s;he tripped out of the room, and &s;lew as expeditiou&s;ly up &s;tairs, as if &s;he really had the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation to &s;ettle by eleven o'clock that night.</P>

<P>Heaven be prai&s;ed, &s;aid Mrs. Dar|lington, &s;miling, that my little chat|tering magpie of a niece is gone. Did you ever hear any body, when &s;he is once &s;et in for it, talk &s;o much in your life, Benignus? She's very agreeable, madam, &s;aid I. Oh, &s;he is a noi&s;y thing, cries Mrs. Darlington; but now &s;he has taken to one of her
<PB N="176" REF="183">writing &s;its again, the hou&s;e will be a little &s;till, for we &s;hall &s;eldom &s;ee her now, but at meals. She's perfectly rivetted to the de&s;k, when once &s;he begins. How much do you think that little &s;lut &s;quanders yearly, cou|&s;in, in paper, pens, and &s;ealing-wax, be&s;ides the po&s;tage of letters? Why, madam, an&s;wered I, as my cou&s;in is a very great writer, and &s;o ample a circle of corre&s;pondents, I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e &s;he may exhau&s;t, in this innocent way, five or &s;ix &s;hillings a week: Speak louder, child, &s;aid the old lady, twirling up her ear. I had forgot her deafne&s;s, and to make amends for that forgetfulne&s;s, repeated what I had before &s;aid, as loud as I rea&s;on ably could: but even this effort did not an&s;wer, for Mrs. Darlington &s;aid,
<PB N="177" REF="184">You need not &s;hout neither, cou&s;in; I am not ab&s;olutely deaf to the noi&s;e of a cannon&mdash;the medium, my dear, betwixt a bawl and a whi&s;per, is the point: five or &s;ix &s;hillings! five or &s;ix and twenty, Benignus! I &s;tared! Truth, &s;ays &s;he, or I'm not a woman. As I had no rea&s;on to di&s;pute this matter, I gave her credit for her one pound five, the certainty of her &s;ex; and ob&s;erved, that the &s;um to be &s;ure was not very trifling, but that there was no accounting for <HI>propen&s;ities.</HI> Now, it was the great misfortune of this lady to hear &s;o <HI>very</HI> little of what was &s;aid in conver&s;ation, that &s;he of|ten made &s;ad work with one's expre&s;|&s;ions, and &s;ometimes by catching up one word, and lo&s;ing another, the meaning of the whole &s;entiment would
<PB N="178" REF="185">frequently appear &s;o impertinent and offen&s;ive, that there was no bearing it unnoticed: whenever this happen|ed, the good woman, &s;uppo&s;ing the per&s;on &s;peaking taking an unfair ad|vantage of her infirmity, would lo&s;e all &s;ort of patience, and without any regard to per&s;ons, fall into the mo&s;t violent paroxy&s;ms of fury, and was never known perfectly to forgive the per&s;on whom &s;he imagined &s;o to have in&s;ulted her. I had no &s;ooner got to the unlucky word <HI>propen&s;ity,</HI> of which &s;he only heard the middle &s;yllable <HI>pence,</HI> upon which I happened to lodge the empha&s;is, than imagining I di&s;|puted her veracity, the colour of con|fu&s;ion and anger be&s;pread her face, and &s;he began in the following man|ner. <HI>Pence,</HI> &s;ir, <HI>pence?</HI> As plain as I
<PB N="179" REF="186">could &s;peak, I told you &s;hillings: What do you mean by <HI>pence?</HI> Me|thinks 'tis too early for you, &s;ir, who are ju&s;t come into my hou&s;e, to in|vade the laws of ho&s;pitality, in&s;ult my misfortune, and di&s;pute my ve|racity. But infirmity is always the butt of boys,&mdash;always laughed at, and always contradicted: yet I heard you, &s;ir, be a&s;&s;ured: Yes, and I can re|peat every thing you &s;aid too: You &s;aid I mu&s;t <HI>not take account of a few pence:</HI> I would have you to know, &s;ir, I am not a mercenary woman, I love my niece as well as ever parent loved a daughter, nor did I wi&s;h to abridge her amu&s;ements, I &s;poke only for the &s;ake of conver&s;ation, in a harmle&s;s chit-chat way; but I &s;hall learn to hold my tongue when I am
<PB N="180" REF="187">before &s;ome per&s;ons: I &s;hall take care what I &s;ay for the future, depend up|on it, &s;ir, I &s;hall. <HI>Pence,</HI> indeed! Fye upon it, fye upon it! What, in the very fir&s;t month to behave rudely to me! I could not have imagined it, cou&s;in, I could not have imagined it!</P>
<P>When Mrs. Darlington had brought her &s;peech to a conclu&s;ion, &s;he drew her&s;elf up into a heap, waved her&s;elf up and down in her chair, in the true &s;ee-&s;aw of di&s;tre&s;s, flung her a|pron over her face, began to &s;tamp with an angry vehemence, and &s;eem|ed to mourn heavily that a relation could be &s;o cruel to turn pounds into pence, and play upon her misfor|tune, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was deaf, which &s;he violently declared &s;he
<PB N="181" REF="188">was not. I did, and &s;aid, every thing I could to exculpate my&s;elf from the charge of either playing upon her misfortune, or di&s;puting her veracity, prote&s;ting that &s;he mi&s;under&s;tood me, and that I hoped &s;he would ever find me above the incivilities and cruel|ties &s;he was ha&s;tily led to attribute to me. My apologies were vain; &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that what &s;he <HI>did</HI> hear, was a flat contradiction of what &s;he had a&s;&s;erted, and that &s;he did not doubt what &s;he did <HI>not</HI> hear was downright abu&s;e. Seeing her in this temper, I thought it be&s;t to leave her to her&s;elf, and accordingly ro&s;e to go into another room, till the &s;torm was blown over; but this prudent de&s;ign made her ten times wor&s;e than ever, and, in her idea, &s;o aggravated the
<PB N="182" REF="189">offence, that &s;he got up with great di&s;dain, and to&s;&s;ing her&s;elf out of the room, &s;aid there was no occa&s;ion for my withdrawing in the mid&s;t of her mi&s;ery, to convince her that her com|pany was di&s;agreeable; for as I thought proper to be her gue&s;t, &s;he knew the laws of politene&s;s, as well as &s;ome folks tho&s;e of good manners, and &s;hould rather turn <HI>her&s;elf</HI> out of the hou&s;e than her vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Being left alone, I gave way to the pique which her la&s;t words had oc|ca&s;ioned, and thinking my&s;elf ill u&s;ed, caught up my hat, and without tak|ing leave of a &s;ingle creature, or &s;peak|ing a word to any one, opened the great door my&s;elf, and &s;allied into the &s;quare.</P>
<P>And is there not then, &s;aid I, (walk|ing along the pavement) is there not
<PB N="183" REF="190"><HI>one</HI> con&s;i&s;tent character? Am I never to meet with a &s;ingle being, regular in its conduct, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in its principles. Are all mankind thus variable? Shall I never find a per&s;on to-morrow, like what I found him to day. Of all women, at fir&s;t &s;ight, Mrs. Darlington appeared the be&s;t na|tured and the be&s;t bred; Mr. Dra|per &s;eemed the mo&s;t foppi&s;h and effe|minate of men; the female who &s;a|luted me in the coach, the mo&s;t af|fable of girls; Mr. Skain the mo&s;t ob&s;equious of taylors; Mr. Abrahams the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of &s;tewards; Alicia the happie&s;t of nieces; and Spangle the mo&s;t courageous of cox|combs; and yet every one of them have changed their characters, and, at a &s;econd view, are the very rever&s;e what they appeared at fir&s;t: <HI>Fronti</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="191"><HI>nulla fides,</HI> &s;ure enough, as Abrahams &s;ays: Why, I &s;hall begin to believe by and by there is not a con&s;i&s;tent character&mdash;not a <HI>&s;emper eadem,</HI> upon earth. And not be very wide of the truth, neither, an&s;wers a voice from behind, which, on turning round, I ob&s;erved came from a gentle|man walking pretty near me. This induced me to quit reflections, for the pre&s;ent, and to enquire of this per&s;on which was the way to Dover|&s;treet, intending to tre&s;pa&s;s, for a night or two, (till I could otherwi&s;e accom|modate my&s;elf) upon my friend Dra|per. The gentleman an&s;wered with great curte&s;y, but with extreme quick|ne&s;s of &s;peech, that we were at no great di&s;tance from Dover-&s;treet, and that, although it was the contrary road from that he was pur&s;uing, yet
<PB N="185" REF="192">that he would very readily &s;tep back with me through the &s;quares, and &s;et me right. I thanked him for his offer, and turning back (for I had gone utterly out of the way) we walked &s;ociably and nimbly together. You have apartments in Dover-&s;treet, I pre&s;ume, &s;ir, que&s;tioned the gen|tleman? I have a friend re&s;ides there, &s;ir, replied I, with whom I am going to pa&s;s the night, but being very late|ly come to London, and but a poor recollector of &s;treets, I am not yet &s;ufficient ma&s;ter of the many intricate turnings of the town. Nor I, neither, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, re&s;umed the gentle|man, who have been fourteen years a hou&s;e-keeper in it: the labyrinths of London, I can tell you, are not ea&s;ily found out, and a man may pa&s;s his
<PB N="186" REF="193">whole life here, and mix in all its bu&s;tle, yet in many re&s;pects be a &s;tranger &s;till. Ju&s;t as he &s;aid this, a &s;udden &s;hower began to pelt us pretty &s;martly. Ods bobs! cries the gentle|man, I don't know how you may like this &s;ort of amu&s;ement, but I had much rather be &s;oaking the in&s;ide than the out&s;ide, and if you &s;hould not hap|pen to be in ha&s;te, I know of a little &s;nug place hard by, where we might take a friendly &s;neaker together, and pur&s;ue our walk as &s;oon as the &s;hower is over. There was &s;omething about the &s;tranger I liked, and agreeing chearfully to his propo&s;al, and ob|&s;erving that my time was my own, he rubbed his hands plea&s;urably toge|ther, and &s;lapping his hat, ran bri&s;kly through the rain, till he came to the
<PB N="187" REF="194">middle of the &s;treet, and entered, what is known by the name of an eat|ing-hou&s;e.</P>

<P>The gentleman de&s;iring a private room, the waiter &s;hewed us into a little box up one pair of &s;tairs, and with innumerable bends of the body, &s;tood attending our commands. It's too &s;oon to eat, whi&s;pered my guide to me, but the&s;e hou&s;es always ex|pect us to call for &s;omething, and, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e we order a veal|cutlet, a pork &s;teak, or a mutton|chop, or any little thing upon earth. Plea&s;e your&s;elf, &s;ir, replied I, nothing
<PB N="188" REF="195">comes ami&s;s to me. Well then, bring us, waiter, a di&s;h of cutlets, a couple of &s;mall ba&s;ons of bouillie, and a &s;al|lad. Perhaps, though, &s;ir, you love tarts: Yes, I know you young&s;ters have a &s;weet tooth. Harkee, waiter, add a few tarts and jellies, and let us have it immediately. On the table in two minutes, gemmin, cried the wai|ter, and &s;kipped out of the room like a fla&s;h of lightning. When he was gone, if you would choo&s;e any little changes, or additions, &s;ay &s;o, cries the caterer.

Up with the pa&s;ty, Timothy, this mo|ment:&mdash;In the to&s;s of a pancake, re|plied the waiter, and clattered down &s;tairs to provide it. Ods fi&s;h, rejoins the gentleman, what heads we have:
<PB N="190" REF="197">nothing to drink now? What's your liquor, &s;ir?&mdash;We mu&s;t have a decent quantum of liquor, becau&s;e that is what is chiefly depended upon: eat a mouth|ful, and drink ten, that's the land|lord's maxim; and what I am going to tell you will &s;ound odd, but I a&s;&s;ure you this little nut &s;hell of a place af|fords as good Madeira as ever was laid to lip, and for porter&mdash;<HI>Fronti nulla fides,</HI> as you very ju&s;tly ob&s;erve: this unpromi&s;ing hut furni&s;hes the be&s;t of every thing, and who would think it, hey?

This was pre|&s;ently done, and the &s;upper (which the gentleman reli&s;hed &s;urprizing|ly, ob&s;erving, that as the ho&s;t|e&s;s was his friend, &s;he would think he was di&s;plea&s;ed if he &s;ent the things down without ta&s;ting) was &s;oon over, for my friend was as bri&s;k at cating, as walking and talking. Indeed, every thing he did or &s;aid was abrupt and precipitate. He was characteri&s;ed by a keen eye, &s;mall features, &s;mart turn of the countenance, and a little round, under&s;ized per&s;on; dre&s;&s;ed in a plain &s;uit of light blue, neither ab&s;o|lutely good, nor ab&s;olutely good for nothing. A pert &s;ort of flippancy marked his face, and, were I not
<PB N="192" REF="199">afraid of hazarding improper lan|guage, I &s;hould &s;ay, there was lo|quacity in his looks. He had all the lively &s;en&s;e of Mr. Draper, but with|out any of his elegance; yet his &s;en|timents were &s;o agreeably &s;elf-&s;uffi|cient, that prattle &s;eldom tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed &s;o little upon patience. After he had poured in almo&s;t all the porter, and three fourths of the Madeira (for I declined more than a gla&s;s of each) he became all jig and jollity, was as fanciful in his attitudes, and move|ments, as a Frenchman: &s;ung catches with a&s;toni&s;hing humour, and rung the changes of convivial &s;entiment &s;o facetiou&s;ly, &s;ometimes playing a tune with his knuckles upon the table, and &s;ometimes &s;hewing off mathe|matical tricks with the gla&s;&s;es, that I

Men wa&s;te the flower of youth in turning over books, going from place to place, hearing what other people &s;ay, and gaping at what other people do: mea&s;uring earth and &s;eas, wa&s;ting their fortunes, perplexing their heads, and blinding their eyes, and then &s;itting them&s;elves impudent|ly down in an elbow chair, exclaim, with all the pomp of ignorance, that they have &s;een, and that they know the world. Dear bought, and far|fetched, in good truth. One might ac|commodate one's &s;elf, &s;ir, with &s;ix times the intelligence, without &s;tepping over

<P>How, &s;ir, &s;aid I, is it po&s;&s;ible I can acquire as much experience from&mdash; Pry'thee don't put me out, an&s;wered the gentleman; I have read, and &s;tared, opened my eyes, and opened my mouth, and a&s;ked advice, and taken my own way, as much as any man. For above a dozen years was I, as the poet &s;ays, an idle gazer on the light of heaven; and I might perhaps have been an idle gazer &s;till, if I had not found out, that it was
<PB N="201" REF="208">all vexation of &s;pirit. One book told me one thing, which I &s;aw ab&s;olutely contradicted in another; and the friends whom to-day I con&s;ulted, were of quite a different opinion the next morning: &s;o at la&s;t, &s;ir, I e'en gave up the hope of wi&s;dom in mere de&s;pair, &s;old off all my books, avoid|ed the company of my friends, and in de&s;pite of authors, and all their works, took the liberty, like a free|born Engli&s;hman, to think for my|&s;elf. Are books then u&s;ele&s;s, in your opinion, &s;ir? &s;aid I, a little eagerly. I have not &s;aid, rejoined the &s;tranger, that they are, but a page of one's own heart is more worth, my dear boy, than a folio of dull printed elaborate compo&s;itions&mdash;of &s;uch things as are now daily vomited from the over|charged
<PB N="202" REF="209">pre&s;s. Volumes generally expatiate upon facts, that the genius of old Flaccus would have compre&s;&s;ed, and that without crouding the &s;en&s;e, in a &s;ingle leaf. Now as to making the grand tour in &s;earch of happi|ne&s;s, I never heard of a more &s;leeve|le&s;s errand: why, I tell you again, aye, and I'll maintain it, all which is done or &s;aid in the whole world, is written on the tablet of a &s;ingle heart Every thing human has been at one time or other tran&s;acted within our|&s;elves.

<P>I, my dear Benignus &mdash; by-the-by, what a cur&s;ed cla&s;&s;ical name you have got&mdash;Oh fye! (an&s;wered I) do you, who have ju&s;t been upbraiding me for taking notice of names&mdash;do you?&mdash; Ha! Ha! Ha!

<PB N="205" REF="212">I have played the Proteus fifty times a day. I have ri&s;en from my bed, in a morning, with &s;o pitiful and ra&s;cally a &s;entiment, that I grudged my&s;elf the muffin at my breakfa&s;t, and charged my &s;ervant (on peril of lo&s;ing her place) not to butter it on both &s;ides: the tea has &s;carce had time to &s;trengthen in the pot, when this dirty idea has been turned out of my head, by &s;ome &s;prightlier fit, which, as it brightened the pro&s;|pect, rendered me more &s;ociable, and then I have been in a humour to ble&s;s every body about me. Perhaps, in the next hour, I meet in my walk &s;ome cro&s;s adventure, or pick up in my way &s;ome cur&s;ed reflection, and &s;o its all over with me again. Thus, out of &s;orts, I hurry home to enjoy
<PB N="206" REF="213">the great prerogative of a hou&s;e|keeper; to wit, the plea&s;ure of re|venging my&s;elf upon my family. In this ca&s;e, my &s;ervants not only know my knock, but the &s;tate of the tem|per when that knock is given. Un|happy his fate who opens the door: woe to the cat, dog, wife, or child, which &s;tands in my way, while I am under this malignant influence: pre|&s;ently, &s;ir, fatigue gives me up to drow&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;I &s;leep it off, and &s;ome|times, to the great joy of my dome&s;|tics, awake in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition imaginable. By and by a <HI>tender</HI> &s;en|&s;ation &s;eizes me; I weep, as I relieve the woe of the wretched, &s;ympathy melts me into tears, and immediately afterwards the tickling of a feather convul&s;es me with laughter: and thus,
<PB N="207" REF="214">in the &s;hort compa&s;s of twenty-four hours, I experience twenty-four changes in my con&s;titution. Examine your&s;elf, young gentleman, and then as &s;ure as this bottle is almo&s;t at the bottom, you will find the ca&s;e your own. Were you never at one time prompted to the mo&s;t petulant ani|mo&s;ities, yet at another &s;o peacefully humoured, or el&s;e &s;o lazily di&s;po&s;ed, that you would put up with the &s;e|vere&s;t injury, rather than be at the trouble or pain of re&s;enting it. Now indolence, now pa&s;&s;ion, now one whim&s;y, now another: fir&s;t freak, then &s;pleen, now one thing, then another: in fine, and to bring my di&s;cour&s;e and my liquor (which you &s;ee runs clear as amber to the la&s;t drop) at once to a conclu&s;ion, the
<PB N="208" REF="215">prevailing maggot of the minute car|ries all before it. And now, &s;ir, what think you of taking a farewell gla&s;s, and pledging an innocent draught of &s;omething in the &s;pirituous way to our next meeting: a &s;up of Nantz is a very fine thing to &s;ettle the &s;tomach for the night; I feel my&s;elf a little &s;icki&s;h, and &s;o pr'ythee, my dear boy, pre&s;s your thumb upon the bell.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e, arguments, method, and ge&s;tures of this Mr. Green, were &s;o infinitely out of the common road, that I could not for &s;ome time make him any other an&s;wer to his la&s;t re|que&s;t, than by the &s;ilent a&s;&s;ent of do|ing, with dumb &s;urprize, as he bid me. In obedience to the &s;ummons (though with much le&s;s agility than before) the waiter came winking in|to
<PB N="209" REF="216">the room, with his wai&s;t-coat un|buttoned, and his napkin tied round his head. Bri&s;k, cried Mr. Green, bring up a noggin of Nantz; and be|fore you venture to attack the &s;tairs, my good lad, pr'ythee rub thy eyes a little, for the &s;ake of thy no&s;e, for at pre&s;ent thou art really walking in thy &s;leep: this ob&s;ervation, Green ac|companied with &s;o awakening a &s;lap on the &s;houlder of Mr. Bri&s;k, that it provoked the poor fellow to inform us it was pa&s;t three o'clock, that all the company were gone out of the hou&s;e, that he had a mo&s;t violent tooth ach, and had been obliged to bind up his jaws, and to lull it by a little nap. Aye&mdash;aye, poor fellow, cries Green, then bring up two noggins of Nantz, and apply one to thy own
<PB N="210" REF="217">tooth my little Bri&s;h. Bri&s;k held his hand to his cheek, nodded thanks, and de&s;cended into the cellar.</P>

<P>With a very large portion of re|mark, &s;hrewdne&s;s, novelty, and &s;heer humour, there was a mixture of meane&s;s, vulgarity, and low life, about Mr. Green, that (unapt as I was to develope characters, at that time), I did not &s;et him down as a man of fa&s;hion. As all excellence is compa|rative, and as we can only compare one <HI>known</HI> object with another, I mea|&s;ured this gentleman with Mr. Dra|per, who, in &s;pite of his queerne&s;&s;es,
<PB N="211" REF="218">was &s;till my &s;tandard. A&s;ter the mo&s;t impartial &s;urvey, Green &s;hrunk ex|ceedingly: he wanted not only the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing advantages of Mr. Dra|per's per&s;on, but his ea&s;e, his addre&s;s, his unaffectedne&s;s, and his deportment. Yet was Green the arche&s;t, drolle&s;t, drye&s;t fellow in the univer&s;e, and &s;oon after he had to&s;&s;ed off the Nantz, took affectionately hold of my hand, and &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>You are a very young fellow, I &s;ee, Benignus; I met you, or rather over|took you, in the &s;treet, and acco&s;ted you as you was <HI>thinking aloud.</HI> I of|fered to &s;hew you the way you had lo&s;t. I invited you to go with me to a public hou&s;e, you did &s;o, and for any thing you could tell to the con|trary, I might have carried you to a
<PB N="212" REF="219">brothel, &s;tripped you naked, and ei|ther turned you adrift, or cut your throat. We are both &s;trangers. What might have been the con&s;equence of your credulity? Nay, don't turn pale, you are fallen into good hands; the only inconvenience you will ever ex|perience from meeting with me, is the nece&s;&s;ity you will be under to pay the bill; for to tell you the truth, I am a little out at elbows, partly indeed from &s;haking them too often. Fortune has lately played me a few of her tricks, and I have a few debts of honour on my hands, which make it convenient for me to be as little fond of di&s;tinc|tion as po&s;&s;ible. Yet I venture forth in the du&s;k, and as it is not yet day|light, I &s;hall get home in &s;afety, &s;o God ble&s;s you, my dear boy! and
<PB N="213" REF="220">when you think of Alexander Green, let it put you in mind of the old max|im&mdash;Beware of your company&mdash;Fare|well, I will &s;end up Bri&s;k to take the bill.</P>
<P>So far from being offended with the venial trick Mr. Green had put upon me, I was truly touched with his &s;ituation, and when I con&s;i|&s;idered how much more <HI>fatally</HI> he might have taken advantage of my &s;implicity, I thought there was a great &s;hare of hone&s;ty about him. Of this I was pre&s;ently more convinced; for upon putting five guineas into his hands, as he was going away, he laid down three of them upon the table, and told me, that though he was a game&s;ter, he was not a &s;harper, often as tho&s;e characters were united&mdash; Luck, he &s;aid, was ju&s;t now &s;orely
<PB N="214" REF="221">again&s;t him, and had driven him (not for the fir&s;t time, though, &s;ays he), to the want of a meal. You have given me, &s;ir, three meals in one; I will keep two guineas becau&s;e I happen to have a wife, and two or three young kids at home, and till I turn up trumps again, it's like to be a lo&s;ing game with them. Two guineas, there|fore, will, as &s;he knows how to play her cards as well as any body, keep the honours in her hand, with regard to butcher and baker, and &s;o forth;&mdash; but I'll touch no more: not that I pretend to any niceties, but as I have drawn you to the verge of the pre|cipice, and made you pay decently for &s;hewing you the danger, I'll be damned before I &s;hove you headlong to the bottom, and &s;o &s;poil one of the
<PB N="215" REF="222">be&s;t things I ever did &s;ince I was created: and &s;o good night to you. &mdash;Saying this, he tied a hankerchief loo&s;ely round his neck, and again &s;haking me by the hand, ran down &s;tairs; leaving me to pa&s;s the remain|der of the morning where and how I thought proper.</P>

<P>And yet &s;uch was the entertainment Mr. Green had given me, that I by no means repented the accident which brought us together, even though it prevented me from getting a bed; for after I had paid the bill, and compli|mented Mr. Bri&s;k the waiter, he in|formed
<PB N="216" REF="223">me I could not have a lodging there, if I would give the world for it; at the &s;ame time telling me, that a chamber-coun&s;el occupied the fir&s;t floor bed-chamber, that his mi&s;tre&s;s lay in the two pair of &s;tairs, that a country curate had taken one of the garrets till Saturday, the other was engaged by the quarter to four hackney writers, who pigged together in the night, and &s;cribbled together, all at a de&s;k, in the day; and that the eating-room and kitchen were full with the cook, him&s;elf, and other &s;er|vants, adding that he did not think there was &s;pace be&s;ides &s;ufficient for a cat to tuck her&s;elf round till the morning. But, &s;ir, &s;ays he, there's a hou&s;e not a va&s;t way off, where you may re&s;t, which is open at all hours,
<PB N="217" REF="224">on purpo&s;e for &s;traggling gentlemen; or, I can perhaps get your honour a chair, which will carry you to your lodgings. Thinking it either too late, or too early to go to Draper's, I con&s;ented to the propo&s;al of the &s;e|dan, which being called, Mr. Bri&s;k ordered the chairman to embox me, and convey me with great care to the Hummums.&mdash;This Hummums had &s;omething to me in the &s;ound I did not like; and the terrible image which Mr. Alexander Green had drawn be|fore me, of &s;trippers and cut-throats, &s;o deterred me, that I tapped at the window, and directed the fellows, at all events, to convey me to Dover|&s;treet, and &s;et down at the corner hou&s;e on the right hand. When I arrived there, Draper, &s;o far from
<PB N="218" REF="225">being in bed, as I expected, was &s;it|ting alone in his dining-room, with a book in his hand, and the moment he &s;aw me, &s;prang up with his u&s;ual vi|vacity, and &s;aid he expected me three hours ago, as Mrs. Darlington had &s;ent to his hou&s;e an account of the quarrel, &s;ome polite conce&s;&s;ions, and a tender invitation to return. There, my dear Benignus, is the lady's card: civil enough, and as much as you can expect from an old woman; but hang it&mdash;don't go there to live any more, 'Tis not the place for a young fellow: here is a mon&s;trous large hou&s;e&mdash;you are a kind of lad that I love, and if you don't di&s;like me, there is a bed up &s;tairs which you will accept of. I was plea&s;ed to receive &s;o obliging a card from my cou&s;in, as I by no means
<PB N="219" REF="226">wi&s;hed to break with her, and her me&s;&s;age took a heavy load from my heart: for when pa&s;&s;ion cools, any alie|nation or e&s;trangement from our friends is a mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;en&s;ation. By the bye, &s;ays Draper, who do you think brought the card; your old friend Benjamin, and the poor boy was cry|ing in my hou&s;e ready to bur&s;t him&s;elf, and begging me upon his knees, to pre&s;s your return to Cavendi&s;h|Square.</P>
<P>I felt and under&s;tood the tears of hone&s;t Benjamin, but did not think proper to explain them. And now, cries Draper, what the deuce has become of you &s;ince you left Dar|lington's in &s;uch a huff: you flew off in a tangent of <HI>delicacy</HI>&mdash;your dearly
<PB N="220" REF="227">beloved <HI>delicacy,</HI> I find! I related to him my adventure at the eating|hou&s;e, and there were tears in his eyes when I fini&s;hed&mdash;Poor Green, &s;aid he&mdash;Many a wor&s;e character than he might have trepanned you into a more &s;plendid apartment, and had le&s;s mercy on your &s;implicity: well, Be|nignus, go to bed and &s;leep: lie down a child, and ri&s;e a man. Not ill plea&s;ed with having e&s;caped the Hum|mums, and found all matters &s;o well at Darlington's, I retired to repo&s;e, and did not long wait the embraces of &s;leep: while Draper (as I had af|terwards rea&s;on to believe) retired to the embraces of a very different na|ture, for Pri&s;cilla had thought proper to return, and Draper had &s;ufficient
<PB N="221" REF="228">attachment to receive her again in his train.</P>
<P>By eight o'clock in the morning, poor Benjamin came of his own ac|cord to Mr. Draper's, and upon hear|ing I was there, became &s;o tran&s;port|ed with joy, that he could not be re&s;trained from running into my cham|ber, and even opening my curtains to &s;atisfy his grateful heart. I bring you, &s;ir, &s;aid he, the kinde&s;t love from both my mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and uncle, and all the &s;ervants, from one end to the other, hoping you will be &s;o kind as to come home. Benjamin, an&s;wered I, &s;tep down &s;tairs my lad, and I will be with you pre&s;ently. As &s;oon as I was dre&s;&s;ed, I wrote a very civil card to my cou&s;ins, promi&s;ing my&s;elf
<PB N="222" REF="229">frequently the plea&s;ure of waiting on them, and acquainting them with the re&s;olution Draper and I, as two young bachelors, had taken to re&s;ide together, &amp;c. then going to Benja|min (whom I found bru&s;hing my hat in the face of the only &s;ervant of Draper's that was out of bed, and he &s;tanding idle with a du&s;ter in his hand) Here, Ben, &s;aid I, carry this with my compliments, to your ladies, and pray don't forget me to your uncle,&mdash;when you are at lei&s;ure too, Mr. Ben, I will get you to bring my portmanteau, in a hackney-coach, as I &s;hall &s;pend a little time at Mr. Dra|per's. And &s;o then, &s;ir, replies Ben|jamin, with a melancholy voice, we are not to have you I find! I was at
<PB N="223" REF="230">&s;ome pains to quiet this excellent young fellow, as to my continuance in Dover-&s;treet, but at la&s;t effected it, by a&s;&s;uring him he would &s;ee me at Mrs. Darlington's, agreeable to the promi&s;e in my letter, almo&s;t every day. This comforted him exceed|ingly, and ju&s;t as he was &s;etting off, by &s;ome means or other, the lower button-hole of my coat caught in a little hook at the bottom of the ban|ni&s;ters (in turning to go up &s;tairs) and tore a piece completely away. Now, &s;aid I, my poor old &s;uit of black, 'tis all over with thee; con&s;tant com|panions we have been a long time, but thy hour is come at la&s;t, and and we mu&s;t part. I am &s;ure, replies Benjamin, if the coat could &s;peak,
<PB N="224" REF="231">&s;ir, it would be &s;orry to leave &s;o good a ma&s;ter; but your honour has talk|ed about a new &s;uit a long while, and if you are not provided with a taylor, I can recommend you to a neat workman, and one of the tip-top &s;ort. Pr'ythee &s;end him then, &s;aid I, Benjamin, for I am &s;o &s;trange a fel|low as to let a thing tumble from my back before I go about repairing it, and though I am this day to dine with my agent have I nothing fit to put on: however, &s;end your friend, and perhaps he may mend this till he can make another. He &s;hall be with you directly, &s;ir, replies Benjamin&mdash; he's a-kin to Nancy Dennis, though between our&s;elves rather &s;hy of &s;peak|ing to her, becau&s;e he's above the
<PB N="225" REF="232">world, as the &s;aying is. How is Nancy, Benjamin? return'd I; I wi&s;h your friend&s;hip for one another may not &s;often into a tender pa&s;&s;ion Ben|jamin, before you are aware: What think you? I&mdash;I&mdash;I'll &s;end the taylor to you immediately &s;ir, &s;ays Benja|min, blu&s;hing and &s;tammering as he gently &s;hut to the door. Having an hour or two upon my hands, and not finding my&s;elf in the lea&s;t drow&s;y, although I had &s;o little re&s;t, I &s;at my|&s;elf down to Mr. Draper's de&s;k, and wrote one letter to Mr. Greaves, one to my attorney near my village, and one to poor Mr. Blewitt, to whom I had already &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, of the na|ture of which the reader will be in due time acquainted (as he will, &s;hould I have life to introduce them)
<PB N="226" REF="233">with a great many other matters of importance: for, probably, there are many per&s;ons he meets with in this hi&s;tory, with whom he would like to cultivate a more intimate acquaint|ance, and thus far therefore I will venture to a&s;&s;ure him, that mo&s;t of the characters which have already figured in this narrative, will make their &s;econd appearance, when it is proper to bring them on the &s;cene, and before the&s;e papers are concluded, the agreeable &s;urprizes of Providence will pre&s;ent him with the fall of the mercenary grocer (whom I tru&s;t is not forgotten), and the re-flouri&s;hing fortunes of the benevolent Blewitt. But this is an anticipation I give into, merely for the quiet of the kind hearted reader, to whom I would re|concile
<PB N="227" REF="234">all that is here in&s;erted for his entertainment: after this promi&s;e therefore, it is expected he will at lea&s;t reward me with his patience, and permit me to di&s;play circum|&s;tances, not ju&s;t as might be wi&s;hed, nor ju&s;t agreeable to the laws of ro|mance and comedy, but ju&s;t as they actually happened in the natural cour&s;e of things.</P>
