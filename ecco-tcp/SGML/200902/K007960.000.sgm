<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, nothing more unintere&s;ting than the ge|nerality of tho&s;e preliminary di&s;cour&s;es, in which Authors too frequently lay out much of their time in talking of them&s;elves and their works. The importance of a Man to him&s;elf is fully di&s;played, while the Reader yawns over the tedious page, or laughs at the rhetoric, that would per&s;uade him he ought to be plea&s;ed. The pre&s;ent Writer has been unwilling, upon al|mo&s;t all occa&s;ions, to conform to a practice which he &s;aw attend|ed with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s: But the following Tragedy is &s;ent into the worla in a manner that may require &s;ome explanation. It has not gone through the &s;iery trial of the Theatre; nor is it re|commended by the favourable deci&s;ion of an Audience. The pomp of &s;plendid &s;cenery, and the illu&s;ions of the &s;kilful per|former, have not awakened the public attention:&mdash;The Play ventures abroad, without having previou&s;ly gained, by the ad|vantages of repre&s;entation, a character, which in the lei&s;ure of the clo&s;et is not always &s;upported. But this circum&s;tance, while it rai&s;es no expectation, may, on the other hand, excite a prejudice not ca&s;y to be &s;armounted. If it be of any value, why was it not produced in the u&s;ual form of a Public Exhibition? The rea&s;ons that influenced the Author, would lead to a long and frivolous detail. Whatever tho&s;e rea&s;ons were, whether caprice, whim, peevi&s;hne&s;s, or delicacy, they were of weight to determine his conduct. His work, however, does not go forth with ac|cu&s;ations of any kind again&s;t the Proprietors of either Theatre: it makes no appeal from their judgment. The fact is, it never was in their hands; and where there was no refu&s;al, there can be no room for complaint.</P>
<P>It need not be di&s;&s;ambled, that the Play was written with a view to the Stage. It was begun and fini&s;hed in the Summer 1783, at a time when the Author was di&s;abled, by a nervous di&s;order in
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
his eyes, from pur&s;uing a more important work, which has en|gaged &s;everal years of his life. It was painful to read, and he found amu&s;ement nece&s;&s;ary. He walked in green fields, made ver&s;es, and threw them upon paper in characters almo&s;t illegible. For a &s;ubject, he was not long at a le&s;s. He remembered that Madame <HI>de S&eacute;vign&eacute;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide her Letter 1st April, 1672.</NOTE> mentions her having attended the repre&s;ent|ation of ARIANE, a Tragedy by the younger <HI>Corneille.</HI> The play, &s;ays that amiable Writer, though in its general &s;tyle and conduct flat and in&s;ipid; was, notwith&s;tanding, followed by all Paris, not for the &s;ake of the poetry, but the Actre&s;s, <HI>La Champm&eacute;l&eacute;,</HI> whom &s;he calls the greate&s;t prodigy the Stage ever beheld. The others were di&s;gu&s;ting; but when the <HI>Champm&eacute;l&eacute;</HI> entered the &s;cene, a murmur of applau&s;e ran through the Theatre; every heart was intere&s;ted, and every eye di&s;&s;olved in tears.</P>
<P>WHEN this country could, with pride, boa&s;t of an Actre&s;s equally followed, and perhaps with better rea&s;on; it occurred that a Tragedy, with the beauties of the original, but freed from it's defects, might, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, be acceptable to the Public. The defects, which drew down the judgment of &s;o enlightened a Critic as Madame <HI>de S&eacute;vign&eacute;,</HI> are pointed out with minute exact|re&s;s, by the judicious <HI>Voltaire.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his Edition of Corseille's Works.</NOTE> From that plea&s;ing Writer we learn, that the Tragedy in que&s;tion &s;till keeps it's rank upon the Stage, whenever an Actre&s;s of eminence wi&s;hes for an opportunity to di&s;play her talents in a principal character. The &s;ituation he ob&s;erves, is intere&s;ting and pathetic: "A prince&s;s, who has done every thing for her hero; who has delivered him from a cruel death, and &s;acrificed all con&s;iderations for his &s;ake; who loves him generou&s;ly; who thinks her&s;elf loved in return, and de&s;erves to be &s;o; who finds her&s;elf, at la&s;t, abandoned by the Man whom &s;he adores, and betrayed by a Si&s;ter whom &s;he al&s;o loved: 'A woman thus &s;ituated,' &s;ays I <HI>Voltaire,</HI> 'forms the happie&s;t &s;ubject that has come down to as from antiquity.' Notwith&s;tand|ing this general account, <HI>Voltaire's</HI> ob&s;ervations, which trace the Author &s;cene by &s;cene, &s;how that Madame <HI>de S&eacute;vign&eacute;</HI> was not mi&s;|taken in her judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">SHALL the pre&s;ent Writer flatter himself that he has removed the vices of the fir&s;t concoction, and &s;ub&s;tituted what is better? He has certainly endeavoured to do it. For this purpo&s;e a New Fable was nece&s;&s;ary. The progre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s re|quired to be conducted in a different manner, with more ra|pidity, and without tho&s;e languid &s;cenes which weaken the in|tere&s;t, and too often border upon the dialogue of Comedy. The characters were to be ca&s;t in a new mould; and in&s;tead of defini|tions of the pa&s;&s;ions, their conflict, their vehemence, and their va|rious tran&s;itions, were to be painted forth in higher colouring, than are to be found in the French compo&s;ition. The Reader, therefore, is not to expect a mere tran&s;lation. The Author does not &s;cruple to &s;ay that he entered into a competition with the original; that he has aimed at a better Tragedy; and to u&s;e the words of a late elegant Writer, <HI>he hopes he has &s;hown &s;ome inven|tion, though he has built upon another man's ground.</HI></P>
<P>BUT here again the que&s;tion recurs, if the new &s;uper&s;tructure rai&s;ed upon the old foundation has any merit, why not produce it with all the advantage of that celebrated Actre&s;s, who, it &s;eems in&s;pired the fir&s;t de&s;ign? The plain truth &s;hall be the an&s;wer: When the piece was fini&s;hed, the Author had his moments of &s;elf-approbation, and in his fir&s;t ardour, hinted to a friend, that he in|tended to give it to the Stage. But &s;elf-approbation did not la&s;t long:&mdash;That glow of imagination, which (to speak the truth) is &s;ometimes heated into a plea&s;ing delirium with its own work, &s;ub&s;ided by degrees, and doubt and diffidence &s;ucceeded. A Play, that might linger nine nights upon the Stage, was not the object of the Author's ambition; Whether he has been able to execute any thing better, he has not con&s;idered for a long time, nor has he now courage to determine. He has often &s;aid to him&s;elf, in the words of TULLY, <HI>Nihil hue, ni&s;i perfectum ingenio, Elaboratum Indu&s;tri&acirc;, afferri oportere;</HI> and after adopting, in his own case, &s;o rigid a rule, how &s;hall he pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the production of a &s;ummer can boa&s;t either of genius, or the elaborate touches of indu&s;try?</P>
<P>IN this irre&s;olute &s;tate of mind, the Author's re&s;pect for the Public, who have done him, upon former occa&s;ions, very parti|cular
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
honour, increa&s;ed his t'midity: he was unwilling to appear a candidate for their favour, when he was not &s;ure of adding to their plea&s;ure. At pre&s;ent, being to give an edition of &s;uch pieces, as he has been able to produce, he could not think of keeping back the only dramatic work left upon his hands. He, therefore, &s;ends it into the world an humble adventurer: with one of, his predece&s;&s;ors, he &s;ays, '<HI>Va mon Enfant; prens ta For|tune.'</HI> The Play amu&s;ed him while he was engaged in the writ|ing of it, and &s;hould the candid Reader find an hour of lei&s;ure not entirely thrown away in the peru&s;al, the Author will not think his time altogether mi&s;-employed. He now di&s;mi&s;&s;es the Piece, if not with indifference, at lea&s;t with resignation; content to leave the honours of the Theatre to Writers of more ambition than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at pre&s;ent.</P>

<L>WHENE'ER the Poet, in retiring vein,</L>
<L>Proclaims his purpose ne'er to write again,</L>
<L>The threaten'd Town interprets the kind way,</L>
<L>And takes an interest in his next last play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that our Bard has play'd you fast and loose.</L>
<L>Or pleads this general candour for excuse;</L>
<L>He dares not trifle with the public sense,</L>
<L>But thinks such folly downright impudence;</L>
<L>Brought, not advancing, since he then appears,</L>
<L>To risk the well won fame of forty years,</L>
<L>He trusts distinct indulgence you' ll afford&mdash;</L>
<L>Not he, but Ariadne, breaks his word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From ancient stores we take our plot to-night,</L>
<L>Form'd on the mournful tale of Theseus' flight;</L>
<L>The time, that golden Aera, some relate,</L>
<L>When equal Minos rul'd the Cretan state.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, holy Sage! who taught'st licentious man</L>
<L>To find his freedom where the laws began;</L>
<L>Whose fame in arms, redoubted from afar,</L>
<L>From thine own shores deter'd invasive war&mdash;</L>
<L>Whilst thy mild genius o'er a prosperous isle</L>
<L>Gave every good and every grace to smile;</L>
<L>'Till thine to all thy subjects were as dear,</L>
<L>As George's virtues to his Britons here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To all our author bids me humbly bend,</L>
<L>But deprecate no foe, end court no friend:</L>
<L>With grateful pride he thinks of honors past,</L>
<L>And hopes you 'll bid those valu'd honors last.</L>

<L>Like ro&s;es blu&s;hing through the morning dew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye men, &mdash;ye boa&s;ted lords of the creation,</L>
<L>Who give your Ariadnes &s;uch vexation;</L>
<L>May I approach you, pray? and may I dare</L>
<L>A&s;k why you droop?&mdash;and why that languid air?</L>
<L>'Tis &s;ympathy in guilt; and The&s;eus' ca&s;e</L>
<L>With ri&s;ing blu&s;hes crim&s;ons ev'ry face;</L>
<L>Ceu&s;ure on fraud like his, you own, mu&s;t fall:</L>
<L>Too well you know&mdash;he repre&s;ents you all.</L>

<LG>
<L>And yet you've &s;ame excu&s;e; the&s;e modi&s;h days</L>

<PB REF="70">
<L>When a <HI>GRAND SWEEPSTAKES</HI> to Newmarket calls.</L>
<L>And <HI>FIVE TO FOUR</HI> each groom, each jockey bawls:</L>
<L>What beauty then can lure you from the cour&s;e,</L>
<L>And hope&mdash;you'll love her <HI>BETTER</HI> than year <HI>HORSE?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When to the Club the gaming rage invites,</L>
<L>And fa&s;cinating <HI>FARO</HI> claims your nights;</L>
<L>The tender pa&s;&s;ion then intrudes no more,</L>
<L>And <HI>FORTUNE</HI> is the <HI>VENUS</HI> you adore.</L>
<L>But is &s;he con&s;tant?&mdash;Lo&s;s on lo&s;s en&s;ues,</L>
<L>And bonds, and mortgages, attorneys, Jews:</L>
<L>Love then may well his &s;ofter rights forego,</L>
<L>Spread his light wings, and fly the &s;cene of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the times a nobler plea may yield;</L>
<L>A War invites you;&mdash;arm, and take the field.</L>
<L>The <HI>SONS OF FRANCE</HI> would fain &s;ubvert your laws;</L>
<L>Go forth the champions of your country's cau&s;e.</L>
<L>Behold the bright example of the day,</L>
<L>Go&mdash;where our <HI>ROYAL FREDERICK</HI> leads the way;</L>
<L>So Albion's liberties &s;ecure &s;hall &s;tand,</L>
<L>And <HI>KING,</HI> and <HI>LORDS,</HI> and <HI>COMMONS</HI> guard the land.</L>
