<P>DO not let the news that I am going to communi|cate afflict you too much. I wi&s;h I could conceal it from you, but I cannot. Your father is dan|gerou&s;ly ill, and without a miracle in his favour we mu&s;t lo&s;e him. O heavens! my heart is ready to bur&s;t when I think of his affliction. For the&s;e &s;ix days I have not clo&s;ed my eyes, and am now &s;o weak that I can &s;carcely hold my pen. You mu&s;t come home immediately. The &s;ervant who delivers you this letter, will return with you. Your father de&s;ires earne&s;tly to &s;ee you. "Mau|rice, my dear Maurice, if I could embrace him before I die!" he has repeated a hundred times in the day. Would to heaven that you were here now! However, do not lo&s;e a moment in packing up your things; and I have ordered the man to make all po&s;&s;ible expedition. Every moment will be an age of anxiety to me, until I cla&s;p you in my arms. Adieu, my dear child! may the Lord protect you from all dangers on your journey! I wait your return with the mo&s;t lively impatience, and am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have now no other friend but you to apply to, and from you alone I can hope for comfort in a misfortune too weighty for me to bear. Heaven has deprived me of
<PB N="2" REF="6">what was deare&s;t to me on earth, my beloved hu&s;band. You know how &s;incere and tender an affection I bore him. This day &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnight he de&s;ired me to &s;end for our &s;on from &s;chool. When Maurice was brought up to his Bed, he &s;tretched out his hand to him, and had &s;carcely given him his ble&s;&s;ing, before he expired. With him is gone all the &s;atisfaction and happine&s;s of my life. You &s;ee me now plunged into a &s;ituation the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful and afflicting to a woman, and a mother. Yet if I &s;uf|fered alone, I could bear it; but my poor &s;on &s;ighs by my &s;ide. He is not yet &s;en&s;ible of the misfortune of being an orphan. It wounds my heart to &s;ee him look up to me with tears in his eyes, while he pre&s;&s;es my hand, and &s;peaks of his father. None but a mother can have an idea of &s;o afflicting a &s;ight. I think at tho&s;e times that I read in his looks the&s;e melancholy words: "It is you alone, my dear mother, that mu&s;t maintain me now." Wherever I go, he is at my &s;ide, and wipes the tears from his little eyes with my gown. Sorrow &s;tops my voice when I would comfort him, for the very &s;ight of my child renews all my afflictions. How &s;hall I maintain him? My poor hu&s;band has left me nothing, and my hands are too feeble to work. To whom then &s;hall I look for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, unle&s;s to you? On you alone I re&s;t all my hopes. Heaven, I doubt not, will di&s;po&s;e your heart to relieve a de&s;titute and forlorn widow, and to prove that the ties of blood which unite us are &s;acred. I give up my &s;on to your care. Whatever kindne&s;s you &s;hew to him, I &s;hall receive as performed for my &s;ake, and for the memory of a man who loved you. All the &s;trength and &s;pirits that I have left I will exert, to gain my&s;elf a livelihood by working; but to bring up my &s;on properly is beyond my power. I give him up therefore to you en|tirely. However &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it may be to part with my child, I mu&s;t yield to nece&s;&s;ity. In the mean time I comfort my&s;elf in the reflexion, that I rely on the favour of a merciful God, and the kindne&s;s of a worthy relation. Be you to him as a father, and enable him one day to &s;often my afflictions. I am unable to proceed. My tears, which wet my paper, &s;hew you &s;ufficiently what my heart feels. You have it in your power to determine my hap|pine&s;s, and the well-being of my &s;on. God will for ever
<PB N="5" REF="7">ble&s;s your liberality; he will reward you even in this world for your kindne&s;s to two unfortunate relations. I am, dear cou&s;in,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Yours of the 7th in&s;t. in which you inform me of your hu&s;band's death, has given me the &s;incere&s;t affliction. You may be a&s;&s;ured, I partake of your grief, and feel &s;till more for your lo&s;s than for my own. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I cannot help being a good deal &s;urprized that you think of applying to me alone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Is it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that your &s;on &s;hould have the educa|tion of a &s;cholar, and add another to the number of half|learned &s;matterers that are already in the world? Are there not many other profe&s;&s;ions in which he may render as great &s;ervices to &s;ociety, and labour to more advantage for his own intere&s;t? Con&s;ider with your&s;elf, how without fortune or friends will he be able to advance him&s;elf? You know the world too well, to make it nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;hew you that &s;uch an attempt would be impracticable. On the other hand, it would be unplea&s;ing to your&s;elf to &s;ee him chargeable to &s;trangers. You &s;peak of the ties of blood; but my own family, which is very nu|merous, puts me more forcibly in mind of them; and I beg you to believe that it is with great difficulty I can maintain them in a &s;uitable manner. To load my&s;elf with an additional burthen, is ab&s;olutely out of my power; and I am convinced, that upon more mature re|flexion, you will di&s;pen&s;e with my doing &s;o. All that I can do is to put your &s;on apprentice to a mercer at Ro|che&s;ter, a Mr. Durant, with whom I have concerns in bu&s;ine&s;s. I promi&s;e you, he &s;hall be well treated there. You may &s;end him upon trial for &s;ome time: and if ap|proved, he will take him without a fee. Con&s;ider ma|turely of my offer, and let me know your determination, and your &s;on's. If he re&s;olves to go to the Univer&s;ity, it is ab&s;olutely out of my power to maintain him there. I

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I cannot forget the care that you and Mrs. Ma&s;ters took of me while at your academy, though I have at pre&s;ent &s;carcely &s;trength to write you the&s;e lines of acknowledge|ment. But my mama, who &s;its by me crying, is un|able through grief to take pen in hand, and has &s;aid that ta&s;k on me who am &s;o unfit for it. However, from re|membering your con&s;tant kindne&s;s to me, I find &s;ome &s;a|tisfaction in writing to you, though I may &s;ucceed but indifferently. You are already informed, I &s;uppo&s;e, of my papa's death. Ah! &s;ir, what you foretold me is not come to pa&s;s. You bid me not to be unea&s;y; that I &s;hould perhaps, when I came home, find my papa out of danger. But, alas! he is dead. My mama is now a poor widow, and I an orphan. I dreaded no le&s;s, as I came near our hou&s;e. I had fallen a&s;leep in the chai&s;e, and dreamed that my papa was in heaven; and that he took me by the hand, and &s;poke to me. At this I awoke, and in waking, &s;eemed to hear the pa&s;&s;ing-bell toll. Yet we were not near the hou&s;e, and had more than three miles to go yet. At la&s;t, when I arrived, my mama was at our door, waiting for me, all in tears. She ki&s;&s;ed me, and took me up &s;tairs to my papa who was in bed and almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s. When I ki&s;&s;ed him, oh dear! how I cried and &s;obbed. At this he opened his eyes, and &s;eeing me, laid his hand upon my head, and gave me his ble&s;&s;ing; but in &s;o faint a voice as &s;carcely to be heard. Ah! you cannot imagine how my mama and I cried. All his neighbours and acquaintance were in tears, too, at his funeral; but mama and I more than any body. I begin to eat and drink a little, but my mama has ab&s;olutely taken no nouri&s;hment, &s;o that &s;he is as pale as death; and I beg of her continually not to die, for then I do not know what would become of me in this world. Ah! dear &s;ir, you may imagine how great a trouble it is to mama and me, that I am not able to continue my
<PB N="5" REF="9">education. But it cannot be otherwi&s;e, and I mu&s;t be content. My mama has written to her cou&s;in in London, who is a rich merchant, to reque&s;t him to maintain me at &s;chool; but he will not, and he &s;ays that I &s;hall be no better than a half-learned &s;matterer. For my part, I think, I might have learning enough if my mother had the tenth part of his money. But no; I mu&s;t go apprentice to Mr. Durant the mercer, at Roche&s;ter. I cannot tell you how much that grieves me. Mama &s;trives to comfort me, and tells me that it is a reputable line of bu&s;ine&s;s, and that I may make a fortune by fol|lowing it with application. But what does all this &s;ignify, when one di&s;likes it? You know, dear &s;ir, that learning was all to me: I wi&s;hed to be as good a &s;cholar and di|vine as my papa. Before, I had always a book in my hand; now I &s;hall be employed mea&s;uring &s;ilks with a yard. But I mu&s;t hold my tongue, &s;ince it cannot be otherwi&s;e. Dear &s;ir, I wi&s;h you happine&s;s, and &s;hall al|ways think of you. I hope, too, that you will not for|get me, and thank you again for your kind treatment of me. I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Durant will &s;eldom take me to Lon|don, &s;o that as I pa&s;s there in my way to Roche&s;ter, I &s;hall go and &s;ee you and Mrs. Ma&s;ters; and if ever I come into great bu&s;ine&s;s, you &s;hall take whatever you plea&s;e in my &s;hop, without paying a farthing. Only try. You &s;hall &s;ee. Meantime I am, and ever &s;hall be,</P>

<SPEAKER>Maurice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my poor mama is widow to a clergy|man of Oxford. My papa is dead the&s;e two months. He was too charitable to the poor to leave much money be|hind him. He kept me at &s;chool for three years near London; but I was &s;ent home a little before he died, be|cau&s;e he wi&s;hed to &s;ee me once more. And as it was not in mama's power to continue my education, a kin&s;|man of hers &s;ent me to be apprentice to Mr. Durant the mercer. I am with him upon trial. But if my relation that is &s;o rich had thought proper, I &s;hould have gone to the Univer&s;ity and taken my degrees. Ah! I &s;hould have been happy to follow my &s;tudies, and to become one day a great &s;cholar. I was always the foremo&s;t in my cla&s;s, and my ma&s;ters were very fond of me. The next time that your lady&s;hip &s;hall have occa&s;ion for any thing from us, I will &s;hew you a letter from our head ma&s;ter, which I received a week ago. You will &s;ee by it how fond
<PB N="9" REF="13">he was of me. Ay, and he &s;ays, he will be fond of me as long as he lives.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Abber.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt it, my good child. You have already made me very fond of you, though this is the fir&s;t time that ever I have &s;een you. But tell me; would you be glad to go from behind the counter, and return to &s;chool?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ah! if that was po&s;&s;ible. But my mama cannot do it; &s;he has not money enough, and &s;chooling is expen&s;ive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Abber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but if your mother has not, there are many people in the world that have more than enough. What would you &s;ay if I were to &s;end you to a gentle|man who &s;hould examine you, to &s;ee if you have made good u&s;e of the time that you have &s;pent at &s;chool, and are likely to make a progre&s;s if you &s;hould return thither?</P>

<HEAD>THE PARRICIDE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT dreadful weather! I peri&s;h with cold and have no &s;helter again&s;t the bitter winds, no bed to warm my benumbed limbs. I am old and my &s;trength is exhau&s;ted by labour. Unnatural &s;on! The thought of you tears my heart. Unnatural &s;on! I gave you life; I nouri&s;hed you and took care of your weak and &s;ickly in|fancy. When I &s;aw you &s;uffer through illne&s;s, my tears fell upon your cheeks. You loved me at that time and would &s;ay, while you care&s;&s;ed me, "Papa, what makes you cry? I am not &s;ick now; do not be troubled; &s;ee I am quite well." You rai&s;ed your&s;elf up in your bed; your little hands would play in my hair, and you would &s;ay again, "Do not grieve any more; I am cured." And as you &s;poke the words, you would fall down again through weakne&s;s. You would &s;trive to &s;peak, but could not. At la&s;t, however, your body grew &s;trong; you be|came hale and robu&s;t, and you &s;hould have been the prop of my old age. I laboured all my life for you, and now you &s;hut me out of your hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of wind and &s;now. "We cannot live together any longer, father," &s;aid you to me in your fury. And why not, my &s;on? What have I done to you? I have exhorted you to virtue; that is all my crime. When I &s;aw you &s;pend in debauchery the earnings of &s;ixty years labour, the fortune of which I willingly &s;tripped my&s;elf to enrich you, I pointed out your danger to you. God is my witne&s;s that I was more anxious on your account than on my own. Was I not &s;ilent long enough, for fear of troubling you? But my &s;ilence and my &s;orrow, which I &s;trove to hide, made no impre&s;&s;ion on you. I was then obliged to &s;peak. I thought it my duty then to re&s;ume the prerogative of a father; yet my authority was tempered with mildne&s;s. My di&s;cour&s;e was as tender as it was earne&s;t. I &s;poke to you of your mother who died through grief on account of your di&s;orderly life! I &s;poke to you of my&s;elf, whom the &s;ame cau&s;e would probably &s;end to my grave. I &s;hewed you my aged cheeks almo&s;t worn with the tears that you have made me &s;hed. I &s;hewed you my grey hairs which &s;tood on end through angui&s;h and &s;orrow. I opened
<PB N="18" REF="22">my arms to you, to invite you to my bo&s;om. I &s;hould have fallen on my knees to you, if your father, even in that humble po&s;ture, could have &s;oftened you. And you, my &s;on&mdash;I can &s;carcely believe it yet&mdash;you advanced towards me with a threatening air: your arm was &s;tretch|ed out, and your gate &s;hut again&s;t me. You my &s;on? You are no longer &s;o. Why do my bowels &s;till feel the yearnings of a father towards you? I am tempted to wi&s;h that I could cur&s;e you: but no I dare not breathe forth even my complaints aloud. I fear left heaven &s;hould hear them, and left this hou&s;e, which you have &s;hut again&s;t me, &s;hould fall upon your door. I will lay my&s;elf down on the &s;tone before your door. To-morrow you cannot come out without &s;eeing me, and I hardly think that your heart will not &s;often when you &s;ee what I &s;hall have &s;uf|fered during this dreadful night. But if the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, if my exhau&s;ted old age, and &s;till more, the &s;orrows that wound my heart, &s;hould occa&s;ion my death, then &s;hudder at thy crime; weep for me, and for your&s;elf &s;till more. Ah! I &s;hould think my death a fortunate cir|cum&s;tance, if it could produce your reformation.</P>
<P>Such were the complaints of this old man. But the north wind all the live-long night carried away his &s;ighs unheard. The tempe&s;t filled the air with dreadful whi&s;t|lings; the &s;hattered trees of the fore&s;t were bent down; and all nature &s;eemed to &s;hudder with horror at the crime of his &s;on. The next morning the old man was found dead upon the &s;tone. He had his-hands cla&s;ped together, and his face turned towards heaven. The name of his &s;on was the la&s;t word that he had pronounced. He had prayed to the very la&s;t moment for the parricide.</P>

<HEAD>JONATHAN.</HEAD>
<P>JONATHAN, a gardener of Lincoln, was looked upon as the mo&s;t &s;kilful in the county. His fruits &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of his neighbours in bigne&s;s, and were always found to have an exqui&s;ite flavour. All the fir&s;t gentlemen round about were ambitious of having his peaches at their de&s;erts, &s;o that he had no occa&s;ion to &s;end his melons to
<PB N="19" REF="23">the market; they were be&s;poke on the beds, and very often could not be had for gold. The reputation that he obtained, and the profits that he drew from his labours, increa&s;ed his a&s;&s;iduity in the cultivation of his garden. Rich and indu&s;trious as he was, he ea&s;ily found a proper match, and e&s;pou&s;ed Claribell, a young woman in the neighbourhood, as prudent as &s;he was hand&s;ome. The fir&s;t year of their marriage was very happy. Claribell a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her hu&s;band in his labours, and the fruits of their garden were more pro&s;perous than ever.</P>
<P>Unhappily for Jonathan, near his hou&s;e there lived another gardener, called Guzzle, who at day break fixed him&s;elf in an alehou&s;e, which he &s;eldom left before night. Jonathan was delighted with Guzzle's hearty humour, and was not long before he fell into the &s;ame ta&s;te. At fir&s;t, he went now and then to meet him at the alehou&s;e, and only talked to him of gardening; but very &s;oon, in his own garden, he talked to him of nothing but &s;trong beer. Claribell grieved at the change in her hu&s;band's behaviour. As &s;he had not as yet &s;ufficiedt experience her&s;elf to undertake the care of the wall-trees, &s;he was frequently obliged to bring him home to his work, and u&s;ually found him among&s;t his pots and gla&s;&s;es. Alas! it would often have been better for him to &s;tay from the garden. His head was now generally muddled with beer when he went to work upon his trees, and his pruning|knife cut away at random among&s;t the branches: tho&s;e that bore were cut, as well as tho&s;e that did not; and the fine peach trees, on which la&s;t year there had not been<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ingle bough unfruitful, did now only &s;tretch their lazy arms, like &s;o many yawning idlers. The more Jonathan found his garden decay, the more fond he grew of this &s;otti&s;h way of life. His fruit and his vegetables had lo&s;t their great name, and not being able by his earnings to &s;atisfy his fondne&s;s for drink, he parted by degrees with his furniture, his linen, and his clothes. At length one day, when his wife was gone to market with &s;ome roots that &s;he had reared her&s;elf, he went and &s;old all his garden uten&s;ils, in order to drink the money with Guzzle. It would be difficult to de&s;cribe Claribell's grief at her re|turn. To be reduced from a moderate competency to the mo&s;t de&s;titute poverty was not the height of her misfor|tune. She felt &s;till more &s;trongly for the fate of her hu&s;|band,
<PB N="20" REF="24">and of a young infant, &s;ix months old, which &s;he had then at the brea&s;t. Who &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that this child was to &s;ave the whole family from de&s;truction?</P>
<P>The evening of the &s;ame day, Jonathan came home &s;wearing, threw him&s;elf into a chair, and leaning on his elbow over the table, &s;urlily a&s;ked his wife for &s;omething to eat. Claribell handed him a large ca&s;e-knife, and a ba&s;ket that was covered with her apron. Jonathan &s;natched the apron off; but what was his &s;urprize, to &s;ee his own child fa&s;t a&s;leep in the ba&s;ket. "Eat there, &s;aid Claribell to him; it is all that I have left to give you. You are the Father of this child, and if you do not devour him, famine and mi&s;ery &s;hortly will." Jonathan, thunder&s;truck at the&s;e words, remained &s;peechle&s;s, with his eyes &s;tu|pidly fixed upon his &s;on. At length his &s;orrow broke out in tears and exclamations. He ri&s;es, and embracing his wife, a&s;ks her pardon and promi&s;es to reform; and he kept his word.</P>
<P>His father in law, who for &s;ome time had refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, being informed of his good intentions, advanced him a &s;um to enable him to put his garden in order again. Jonathan made good u&s;e of this &s;upply, and very &s;oon his garden flouri&s;hed as happily as ever. He became once more and continued even to his old age, active, in|du&s;trious, a good hu&s;band and a good father. He took plea&s;ure &s;ometimes (though he blu&s;hed at the &s;ame time) in telling this &s;tory to his &s;on, who, from his example, conceived &s;uch an aver&s;ion to drinking and idlene&s;s, that he was all his life as &s;ober as he was laborious.</P>

<P>YONDER is our Valentine walking in the garden with a book in his hand. I am very much afraid that it is rather through vanity than from a real de&s;ire of improving him&s;elf, that he always appears to be bu&s;y reading.</P>

<P>And yet his ma&s;ters give a very flattering ac|count of his diligence, and all agree that he is very far advanced for his age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true. But if my &s;u&s;picions are right, and if the little that he can know has made him vain, I would rather a hundred times that he knew nothing and were mode&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he knew nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear. A man without any great extent of knowledge, but upright, mode&s;t and indu&s;|trious, is a much more e&s;timable member of &s;ociety than a learned man who&s;e &s;tudies have turned his head and puffed up his heart.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>He may learn a good deal of me, but what can I learn from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>If ever you &s;hould have a farm, do you think that it would be of no &s;ervice to you to have an early notion of the labours of the country, to learn to di&s;tingui&s;h trees and plants, to know the times of &s;owing and harve&s;t, and to &s;tudy the wonders of vegetation? Michael po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e different parts of knowledge, and de&s;ires no better than to &s;hare them with you. They will perhaps be one day of the greate&s;t u&s;e to you.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but papa, would it become me to learn any thing from a little country boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, if he is capable of in&s;tructing you? I know no real di&s;tinction among&s;t men, than that of u&s;eful talents and good manners; and you mu&s;t own that in both the&s;e points, he has equally the advantage over you.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, in good manners too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>In every &s;tation, they con&s;i&s;t in treating all per|&s;ons as our duty pre&s;cribes to us. He does &s;o, in &s;hewing a particular attachment and complai&s;ance to you. Do you do the &s;ame? do you make a return of mildne&s;s and good will? And yet he &s;eems to merit them. He is active and intelligent.

<P>What do you mean, my dear?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ju&s;t now convinced of what I only &s;u&s;|pected in the morning. The boy's head is filled with ex|ce&s;&s;ive vanity, and all his reading is but o&s;tentation. He has only lo&s;t him&s;elf on purpo&s;e to make us look for him, and to appear ab&s;ent and forgetful through inten&s;e &s;tudy. It gives me more pain that his mind &s;hould wander from a right way of thinking than if his &s;teps really went a&s;tray. He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time, and there is nothing but a whole&s;ome humi|liation that can &s;ave him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you con&s;ider&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, everything. He is eleven years old. If he can profit any thing by his natural &s;en&s;e or his learn|ing, the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him &s;ufficiently to clear the wood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he has not that thought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will then better &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of profiting by the le&s;&s;ons that I have given him upon this &s;ubject. Be&s;ides, we intend him for the army, and in that profe&s;|&s;ion he will have many nights to pa&s;s without &s;helter. He will know now what it is, and not go to a camp quite raw, to be laughed at by his companions. Then the air is not very cold at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, and for one night he will not die with hunger. Since by his folly he has brought him&s;elf into a &s;crape, let him get out of it again, or &s;uffer the di&s;agreeable con&s;equences of it.</P>

<P>Well, my dear, I will make you ea&s;y, though I am &s;orry that you will not let me follow my plan, as I intended. I &s;hall tell little Michael to join him, as it were by chance.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh! yes, mama; I &s;ee now how much you love me when you in&s;truct me in my work. But pray tell me, have young ladies of fortune and quality any occa&s;ion to learn &s;o many things? When they are mar|ried, have not they waiting women to do for them what|ever they want?</P>

<P>My dear Viola, work is as ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for them as for the children of the poor.

<P>Then here it is. "Mrs. Friendly was always happy in being employed, and never pa&s;&s;ed a quarter of an hour otherwi&s;e the whole day. Angelica, her daughter, could hardly believe her when &s;he talked to her of the &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from indu&s;try, and the di&s;agreeable effects of doing nothing. It is true, &s;he worked whenever her mother bid her, for &s;he was accu&s;tomed to obey; but one may ea&s;ily imagine how unhappy &s;he was at her work, as &s;he never began it but with reluctance. My dear child, Mrs. Friendly would often &s;ay to her, when &s;he &s;aw her at work with her head hanging down, and her hands in a carele&s;s po&s;ture, I wi&s;h you may &s;oon feel the tire&s;ome languor that ari&s;es from having nothing to do, and the &s;atisfaction that one enjoys in being mo|derately employed. This wi&s;h, in&s;pired by her affection, was not long unaccompli&s;hed. Angelica, then about eleven years old, was to go one day with her mother to a coun|try-hou&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="40">many miles off. Mrs. Friendly, at her depar|ture, took her work-bag with her, and &s;trongly recom|mended it to Angelica not to forget hers. Angelica was willing to obey; but how ea&s;ily does one lo&s;e &s;ight of a duty that is performed with reluctance! The work|bag was forgot. Their journey at fir&s;t was quite agree|able. The weather was fine, and all nature &s;eemed to &s;mile. But about noon, the clouds thickened round the horizon, and the thunder rolled from one end of the &s;ky to the other. Their fright obliged them to &s;top at a &s;mall town, where there was only one inn, and imme|diately afterwards the rain came down in a flood. As the approaching &s;torm had forced a number of travellers to &s;eek &s;helter in the inn, Mrs. Friendly and her daugh|ter could not find a &s;ingle room in it di&s;engaged. She therefore ordered the hor&s;es to be unharne&s;&s;ed, and alighted at the hou&s;e of a good old woman clo&s;e by, who very civilly re&s;igned them her bed-chamber and her bed, the only one that &s;he had. How happy was Mrs. Friendly that &s;he had brought her work. The good old woman &s;at be&s;ide her, &s;pinning at her wheel, and between work and conver&s;ation the long &s;ummer's afternoon pa&s;&s;ed away without &s;eeming tedious to them. Poor Angelica was not very happy in the mean time. The cottage was &s;mall, and after &s;he had vi&s;ited every corner of it, &s;he had then ab&s;olutely nothing left to do. The rain, which &s;till fell in great abundance, did not allow her to &s;et her foot out of doors; the terrible noi&s;e of the thunder left her no de&s;ire for &s;leep, and the conver&s;ation of the old woman, who could talk of nothing but her work, was not very likely to amu&s;e her. She begged her mama to let her have <HI>her</HI> work; but Mrs. Friendly told her very ju&s;tly, that &s;he would not deprive her&s;elf of amu&s;ement for her; that having taken care to bring with her &s;ome|thing to employ her&s;elf, it was but fair that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the fruits of her attention, and that &s;he on the contrary &s;hould &s;uffer for her negligence and forgetful|ne&s;s. Angelica could &s;ay nothing to rea&s;ons &s;o forcible. After many weari&s;ome yawnings, &s;ighs of impatience, and fruitle&s;s murmurs again&s;t the weather, Angelica at length got to the end of the evening. She eat a &s;mall &s;upper without appetite, and went to bed much out of humour with her jaunt. How joyful did &s;he ri&s;e at the
<PB N="37" REF="41">fir&s;t &s;ummons of the &s;un who ro&s;e without a cloud! With what eagerne&s;s did &s;he ha&s;ten her mother's departure! At la&s;t the carriage was ready; and Mrs. Friendly, hav|ing generou&s;ly rewarded the good old woman for her civility, &s;et forward again as well &s;atisfied with her man|ner of pa&s;&s;ing the day before, as Angelica was di&s;con|tented with it. The roads had lately been much broken up, and the rain water which &s;till covered them, hin|dered the ruts from being ob&s;erved. The chai&s;e jolted out of one hole into another, the axle creaked, and the gla&s;&s;es rattled; at la&s;t a wheel broke down, and the car|riage was overthrown. Happily Mrs. Friendly and her daughter received no hurt. They recovered from their fright by degrees, and perceiving at a di&s;tance a little hamlet upon the &s;ide of a hill, Mrs. Friendly took her daughter by the hand, and attended by her &s;ervant, walked towards the hamlet, intending to &s;end a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her coachman. There was in this place neither &s;mith nor wheelwright; &s;o that they were obliged to wait al|mo&s;t two days for wheels from town, as Mrs. Friendly would travel in no other carriage but her own. Poor Angelica, how &s;he cried! how &s;he lamented the tediou&s;|ne&s;s of the time! The fright of her fall had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on her, as to deprive her of the u&s;e of her limbs; &s;o that &s;he could not enjoy even the amu&s;ement of walking. What could Mrs. Friendly do to make her time le&s;s heavy? The &s;trict ju&s;tice that &s;he made a point of pur&s;uing with her daughter, forbad her to re&s;ign her own work to her; be&s;ides, Angelica had &s;o neglected her improvement in needle-work, that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have en|tirely &s;poiled it. She then began to feel the value of em|ploying one's &s;elf, and blu&s;hing with &s;hame, &s;aid thus to her mother: Ah! mama, I have well de&s;erved what has happened to me, and now for the fir&s;t time &s;ee the rea|&s;on why you always advi&s;ed me &s;o &s;trongly to work. I have &s;ufficiently felt the weari&s;omene&s;s of doing nothing. She then threw her&s;elf into her mother's arms, and hiding her face in her bo&s;om, I beg pardon, mama, for griev|ing you by my indolence. I &s;aw that you were troubled to &s;ee me fret. But, for your &s;ake and my own, I &s;hall change my behaviour from this moment. Mrs. Friendly ki&s;&s;ed her daughter, prai&s;ed her re&s;olution, and to &s;trengthen the effect of Angelica's &s;elf-taught le&s;&s;on,
<PB N="38" REF="42">&s;hewed her how a ta&s;te for work hinders our time from hanging heavy, and &s;oftens the vexations of life, by di|verting our thoughts from them in an agreeable and &s;a|latary manner. She ble&s;&s;ed the accidents of a journey that had wrought &s;o happy a change in her daughter.</P>
<P>Angelica, on the other hand, kept her promi&s;e and even went beyond it; &s;o that Mrs. Friendly never had rea&s;on to find fault with her afterwards, unle&s;s for too great application.</P>

<HEAD>THE YOUNG SPARROWS.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Robert one day perceived a &s;parrow's ne&s;t under the eaves of the hou&s;e, and running imme|diately for his &s;i&s;ters to inform them of his di&s;covery, they all contrived together how to get the little covey into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was agreed to wait until the young ones &s;hould be fledged; that then Robert &s;hould rai&s;e a ladder again&s;t the wall, and that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould hold it fa&s;t below, while he climbed up for the ne&s;t. When they thought the little birds &s;ufficiently feathered, they made ready to put their de&s;ign in execution. It &s;ucceeded per|fectly, and they found three young ones in the ne&s;t. The old birds &s;ent forth piteous cries on &s;eeing their little ones, whom they had nouri&s;hed with &s;o much care, taken from them; but Robert and his &s;i&s;ters were &s;o overjoyed, that they did not pay the lea&s;t attention to their complaints.</P>
<P>They were at fir&s;t &s;omething puzzled what to do with their pri&s;oners. Augu&s;ta, the younge&s;t, being of a mild and compa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition, was for having them put into a cage: &s;he promi&s;ed to take the charge of them upon her&s;elf, and to feed them regularly every day: &s;he de|&s;cribed in a lively manner to her brother and &s;i&s;ter, the plea&s;ure that they &s;hould have in &s;eeing and hearing tho&s;e young birds when grown big. This was oppo&s;ed by Ro|bert: he maintained that it was better to pluck them ju&s;t as they were, and that it would be much more <HI>funny</HI> to look at them jumping about in the room without feathers, than to &s;ee them di&s;mally &s;hut up in a cage. Charlotte, the elde&s;t, declared her&s;elf of the &s;ame opinion as Augu&s;ta, but Robert per&s;i&s;ted in his own.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43">At la&s;t the two little girls, &s;eeing that their brother would not give up the point, and that be&s;ides he had the ne&s;t in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, agreed to whatever he de&s;ired. But he had not waited for their con&s;ent to begin his execution. The fir&s;t was already plucked. There is one &s;tript, &s;ays he, &s;etting it on the ground. In a moment all the little family were deprived of their tender feathers. The poor things cried, <HI>peep! peep!</HI> and complained very piteou&s;ly; they &s;huddered with the cold, and &s;hook their bare little wings. But Robert, in&s;tead of pitying their &s;ufferings, did not end his per&s;ecutions there: he pu&s;hed them with his toe to make them go on, and whenever they tumbled over the bur&s;t out a laughing; and at la&s;t his &s;i&s;ters joined in the laugh with him.</P>
<P>While they were indulging this cruel amu&s;ement, they &s;aw at a di&s;tance their tutor coming towards them. Mum! Each pocketed a bird, and was &s;linking off.

<P>Ju&s;t &s;o. Therefore, if tho&s;e birds could have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in our &s;peech, you would have heard them cry, "Ah! father and mother, &s;ave us!

<P>The little girls could hold out no longer; they &s;obbed and hid their faces in their handkerchiefs. It was you, Robert, that led us to this cruelty. We hated the thought of it our&s;elves.

<HEAD>THE TWO APPLE-TREES.</HEAD>
<P>ARich hu&s;bandman had two &s;ons, the one exactly a year older than the other. The very day the &s;econd was born, he had &s;et in the entrance of his orchard two young apple-trees equal in &s;ize, which he had &s;ince cul|tivated with the &s;ame care, and which had thriven &s;o equally that nobody could give the preference to either of them before the other. When his children were ca|pable of handling garden tools, he took them, one fine &s;pring day, to &s;ee tho&s;e two trees which he had planted for them, and called by their names; and after they had &s;ufficiently admired their fine growth, and the number of blo&s;&s;oms that covered them, he &s;aid, "You &s;ee, chil|dren, I give you the&s;e trees in good condition. They will thrive as much by your care as they will lo&s;e by your negligence, and their fruit will reward you in proportion to your labour."</P>
<P>The younge&s;t, named Edmund, was indefatigable in his attention. He was all day bu&s;y in clearing his tree of in&s;ects that would have hurt it, and he propped up its &s;tem, to hinder it from taking an ugly bent. He loo&s;ened the earth all round it, that the warmth of the &s;un and the moi&s;ture of the dews might cheri&s;h its roots. His mother had not tended him more carefully in his infancy than he did his young apple-tree.</P>
<P>His brother Mo&s;es did none of all this. He &s;pent his time on a mount that was hard by, throwing &s;tones from it at pa&s;&s;engers in the road. He went among&s;t all the little country boys in the neighbourhood, to box with them, &s;o that he was always &s;een with broken &s;hins and black eyes, from the blows and kicks that he received in his quarrels. He neglected his tree &s;o far, in &s;hort, that he never once thought of it, till one day in autumn he by chance &s;aw Edmund's tree &s;o full of apples, &s;treaked with purple and gold, that were it not for the props which
<PB N="42" REF="46">&s;upported its branches, the weight of its fruit mu&s;t have bent it to the ground. Struck with the fight of &s;o fine a growth, he ran to his own, hoping to find as large a crop on it; but what was his &s;urprize, when he &s;aw nothing but branches covered with mo&s;s, and a few yellow leaves! Quite angry and jealous, he went to his father, and &s;aid, "Father, what &s;ort of a tree is this that you have given me? It is as dry as a broom&s;tick, and I &s;hall not have ten apples on it. But my brother!&mdash;Oh? you have u&s;ed him better. Bid him at lea&s;t &s;hare his apples with me."&mdash; "Share with you? &s;aid his father: &s;o the indu&s;trious would lo&s;e his laber to feed the idle. Take what you get; it is the reward of your negligence, and do not think to accu&s;e me of inju&s;tice, when you &s;ee your bro|ther's rich crop. Your tree was as fruitful and in as good order as his. It bore as many blo&s;&s;oms, and grew in the &s;ame &s;oil; only it had not the &s;ame u&s;age. Edmund has kept his tree clear of even the &s;malle&s;t infects; you have &s;uffered them to eat up yours in its blo&s;&s;om. As I do not chu&s;e to let any thing which God has given me, and for which I hold my&s;elf accountable to him, go to ruin, I take this tree from you again, and call it no more by your name. It mu&s;t pa&s;s through his hands to recover it&s;elf, and is his property from this moment, as well as the fruit that he &s;hall make it bear. You may go and look for another in my nur&s;ery, and rear it, if you will, to make amends for your fault: but if you neglect it, that too &s;hall belong to your brother, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting me in my labour."</P>
<P>Mo&s;es felt the ju&s;tice of his father's &s;entence, and the wi&s;dom of his de&s;ign. He went that moment and cho&s;e in the nur&s;ery the mo&s;t thriving young apple-tree that he could find. Edmund a&s;&s;i&s;ten him with his advice in rear|ing it, and Mo&s;es did not lo&s;e a moment. He was never out of humour now with his comrades, and &s;till le&s;s with him&s;elf, for he applied chearfully to work, and in autumn he &s;aw his tree fully an&s;wer his hopes. Thus he had the double advantage of enriching him&s;elf with a plentiful growth of fruit, and at the &s;ame time of getting rid of the vicious habits that he had contracted.</P>
<P>His father was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this change, that the following year he &s;hared the produce of a &s;mall or|chard between him and his brother.</P>

<P>Mr. Fergu&s;on &s;hook hands with him over the hedge, and Frank thanked him too in a very manly manner; but he &s;hewed a &s;till more lively gratitude in the hearty appetite that he appeared to have for the pears which did indeed quite run over with juice. That is a very good man, &s;aid Frank to his papa, after he had fini&s;hed the la&s;t, and they had got a good di&s;tance from the old man.</P>

<P>The good old man told you what would have happened to you. God, my dear child, orders every thing that pa&s;&s;es upon earth, and directs events &s;o as to reward good people for their virtuous actions, and to pu|ni&s;h the wicked for their crimes. I will tell you an ad|venture which relates to this &s;ubject, and made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion on me, when a child, that I &s;hall never for|get it as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, how happy I am to-day; a plea&s;ant walk, fine pears, and a &s;tory be&s;ides!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was as little as you, and lived at my father's, we had two neighbours, the one on the right, the other on the left-hand of our hou&s;e: their names were Dob&s;on and Vicars. Mr. Dob&s;on had a &s;on called Simon, and Mr. Vicars one al&s;o of the name of Gamaliel. Behind our hou&s;e and tho&s;e of our neighbours were &s;mall gardens, &s;eparated at that time only by quick|&s;et hedges. Simon, when alone in his father's garden, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with throwing &s;tones into all the gardens round about, never once thinking that he might hurt &s;omebody. Mr. Dob&s;on had ob&s;erved this, and repri|manded him &s;everely for it, threatening to cha&s;ti&s;e him if
<PB N="45" REF="49">ever he did &s;o again. But unhappily this child knew not, or el&s;e did not believe, that one &s;hould not do ami&s;s, even when alone, becau&s;e God is always near us and &s;ees whatever we do. One day, when his father was gone out, thinking that nobody could &s;ee him and therefore that he &s;hould not be puni&s;hed, he filled his pocket with &s;tones and began pelting them all round him. Ju&s;t at the &s;ame time Mr. Vicars was in his garden with his &s;on Gamaliel. This boy had the misfortune to think, as well as Simon, that it was enough not to do ami&s;s before others, and that when alone one might do what one plea&s;ed. His father had a gun charged, to &s;hoot the &s;parrows that came picking his cherries; and he was &s;it|ting in a &s;ummer-hou&s;e to watch them. At this moment, a &s;ervant came to tell him that a &s;trange gentleman wanted him in the parlour: he therefore left the gun in the &s;um|mer-hou&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ly forbid Gamaliel to touch it. But Gamaliel, when all alone, &s;aid to him&s;elf, "I dont &s;ee what harm there would be in playing with this gun a little;" and &s;aying thus, he took it up and began to ex|erci&s;e with it like a &s;oldier. He handled his arms and re&s;ted his firelock, and had a mind to try if he could make ready and pre&s;ent. The muzzle of his gun hap|pened to be pointed towards Mr. Dob&s;on's garden, and ju&s;t as he was going to &s;hut the left eye, in order to take aim, a pebble &s;tone thrown by Simon &s;truck him in that very eye. The fright and the pain together, made Ga|maliel drop the gun, which went off; and, oh! what cries and &s;hrieks were immediately heard in both gardens! Gamaliel had received a blow of a &s;tone in the eye, and Simon received the whole charge of the gun in his leg. Thus the one lo&s;t his eye, and the other remained a cripple all the re&s;t of his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! poor Simon! poor Gamaliel! how I pity them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, it is true, very much to be pi|tied; but their parents &s;till more &s;o, for having children &s;o di&s;obedient and vicious. After all it was a real hap|pine&s;s for the&s;e two bad boys to have met with this acci|dent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you. If God had not early pu|ni&s;hed the&s;e children, they would always have continued
<PB N="46" REF="50">in mi&s;chief, whenever they found them&s;elves alone; whereas they experienced by this warning, that whatever bad actions men do not &s;ee, God &s;ees and puni&s;hes. This was therefore a le&s;&s;on to them to amend them&s;elves, and they became thenceforth prudent and &s;edate, and &s;hunned doing mi&s;chief when alone, as much as if all the world &s;aw them. And this indeed was the de&s;ign of Providence in thus puni&s;hing them; for our merciful Creator never cha&s;ti&s;es us but to make us become better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that eye and leg will make me take care. I will &s;hen what is wrong and do what is right, even though I &s;ee nobody near me.</P>
<P>As he had fini&s;hed the&s;e words, they arrived at their own hou&s;e-door.</P>

<P>You know it was the fir&s;t day of the month; and when my brother, at his landing, wrote to father from Port&s;mouth, he told him that he &s;hould hear from him again, without fail, as ye&s;terday.</P>

And father, unea&s;y at my &s;top, came &s;oon afterwards; and before a quarter of an hour's end, comes mother too. You know I could not quit them. So there we &s;taid until dark night, and no coach.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I can't tell how it is, but I know &s;ome little mi&s;&s;es that have very hand&s;ome faces, and yet they do not plea&s;e me; and I know other that are not counted hand&s;ome, and yet I like their faces very much.</P>

<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is ea&s;ily done. In the fir&s;t place, there is Mi&s;s Bloomer. She has a clear &s;mooth &s;kin, as white as a lily, with fine blue eyes and ro&s;y lips. But &s;he has an affected loll which makes her &s;eem lower than &s;he is; and &s;he hangs her head on one &s;houlder, &s;o that her face looks quite another thing. Then &s;he draws out her words &s;lowly, as if &s;he weighed each &s;yllable, and in &s;peaking &s;he looks at you, expecting you to admire every &s;entence. In the next place, there is the elde&s;t Mi&s;s Archly; &s;he pa&s;&s;es for a beauty, but her looks are &s;o proud and &s;neer|ing, that when we are a number of us together, we can|not help thinking &s;he de&s;pi&s;es or ridicules us. As for Mi&s;s Drake, &s;he carries her&s;elf with &s;o much confidence, and &s;peaks with &s;uch an air of command, that a boy would blu&s;h&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Softly! At this rate we &s;hall fall into &s;candal. I would rather hear you mention tho&s;e who, without being hand&s;ome, have found means to plea&s;e you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know Mi&s;s Emily John&s;on? She is much marked with the &s;mall-pox, and even has a pearl on her left eye from it; but yet her countenance is &s;o plea&s;ing, that one may read in it good-nature, mildne&s;s, and com|plai&s;ance. The younge&s;t Mi&s;s Archly has the &s;malle&s;t ca&s;t in the world with her eyes, from having had &s;ome|thing hung before one eye that was &s;ore for almo&s;t a twelvemonth when &s;he was young. She looks to the right, to &s;ee what is on her left hand. Well, it is no|thing when one becomes u&s;ed to it, and we all love her dearly; &s;he is &s;o lively, and &s;o gay.</P>

<P>Certainly, papa; for otherwi&s;e I cannot tell how &s;ome plea&s;e me who are neither hand&s;ome nor well &s;haped, and how others are di&s;agreeable with all the&s;e ad|vantages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e, I &s;hould think, one &s;ees there &s;ome figns of their di&s;po&s;ition; and we are apt to think that tho&s;e who have an appearance of good-nature in the fea|tures of the face, mu&s;t have a good heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you were before your gla&s;s, you &s;trove, no doubt, to throw a little good-nature into your countenance, that people might imagine you to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in your di&s;po&s;ition too?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you think that &s;uch a countenance may not be deceitful, or that one can a&s;&s;ume the power of plea&s;ing and lay it down at plea&s;ure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, I think &s;o, for I have heard you and others &s;ay a hundred times, "I would never have thought that little girl to have &s;uch a deceitful counte|nance.&mdash;That man looked like hone&s;ty it&s;elf, and yet he has deceived us.&mdash;Such a per&s;on knows how to compo&s;e his face &s;o, that one would &s;wear him to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of every virtue."</P>

<P>Ah! I do not know that, papa.</P>

<P>Or might not this wrong judgment pro|ceed from a want of &s;agacity? or from not &s;ufficiently remarking whether &s;uch per&s;ons have always the &s;ame countenance, or only take it up upon occa&s;ion; or in &s;hort, whether they &s;peak and act con&s;i&s;tently, and uni|formly?</P>

<P>What is the meaning of that, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="71">
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there are a good many things to mind in that. And yet I &s;hould imagine, if I &s;aw any one a long time, and pretty often, and took particular notice of what you have mentioned, I could not be mi&s;taken.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then you &s;uppo&s;e that you are knowing enough in the art of di&s;gui&s;ing the thoughts, and that you have judgment and penetration enough, to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from hypocri&s;y upon a countenance? Really, I &s;hould never have expected &s;o much from &s;o light a little head as yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I have taken notice in Mi&s;s Bloomer, that her prim mouth, her &s;tare, her motions with her head, and that drawling tone of hers, are not natural; and that the elder Mi&s;s Archly's proud flouting look, and Mi&s;s Drake's free undaunted manner is not at all affected, becau&s;e the one is really vain and &s;elf-conceited, and the other impudent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they are not far enough advanced in the art of putting on counterfeit looks. However your opinion is, that our aver&s;ions and our likings, our faults and our virtues are painted on our faces, and that one can read in a per&s;on's features, as in a book, what he is in the bottom of his heart.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why not? I never &s;aw a pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;on with a mild a&s;pect, nor an envious per&s;on with a &s;miling countenance; nor one who was cruel and unfeeling, with looks of tenderne&s;s. Only &s;ee our neighbour, Mrs. Grim|&s;ton, how &s;he eyes people as if &s;he would eat them up, and with what a grumbling voice &s;he &s;peaks.

<P>Becau&s;e we may &s;ee by a per&s;on's figure whether he is weak or &s;trong, &s;ickly or in health; and it mu&s;t be the &s;ame with the di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now I &s;hall give you two pa&s;&s;ages from hi&s;tory, that &s;eem to contradict your notion. A certain able phy&s;iognomi&s;t, called Zopyrus, boa&s;ted that from a view of a per&s;on's &s;hape and countenance, he could di&s;tingui&s;h his manners and ruling pa&s;&s;ions. After one day looking at Socrates, he judged him to be a man of a bad mind and vicious inclinations, &s;ome of which he mentioned. Alcibiades, the friend and &s;cholar of So|crates, who was well acquainted with his ma&s;ter's merit, could not help laughing at the judgment of the phy&s;iog|nomi&s;t and taxing him with gro&s;s ignorance. But Socrates confe&s;&s;ed that he was really by nature inclined to tho&s;e vices of which he was accu&s;ed, and that he pre&s;erved him&s;elf free from them by the con&s;tant exertions of philo|&s;ophy. Ae&s;op, that &s;lave who was endowed with &s;o much wit, had a per&s;on &s;o di&s;agreeable and deformed, that when he &s;tood to be &s;old he could prevail on nobody to purcha&s;e him, until his witty an&s;wers &s;hewed them con|vincingly what he was.&mdash;Here are two examples that &s;eem to prove the contrary of what you maintained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well now, that &s;urprizes me as to Socrates: I have often heard you talk of him with admiration. And as to Ae&s;op too, I have read his fables with &s;o much plea&s;ure. I &s;hould have thought them both the fine&s;t looking per&s;ons in the world. But however, it agrees again with what I &s;aid, that one may be ordinary, and yet have I don't know what of wit, &s;en&s;ibility, or good|nature, in the countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; &s;ickne&s;s or grief may alter the features. But that was not the ca&s;e with Socrates. He owned him&s;elf that he was at fir&s;t viciou&s;ly inclined, and the features of his face &s;trongly confirmed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="73">
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think his an&s;wer explains the difficulty. He was born with a bad di&s;po&s;ition, but as he had much good &s;en&s;e at the &s;ame time, and &s;aw that pa&s;&s;ion, pride and envy were terrible vices, he &s;truggled with them and came at length to get the better of them. His heart was purged of his faults, but his countenance kept the marks of them &s;till.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem to be pretty ready at a reply. Nay, there is &s;ome truth, too, in your rea&s;oning. How|ever, I have a &s;mall que&s;tion to propo&s;e to you.&mdash;If Mi&s;s Archly, that proud little mi&s;s, who has a face, you &s;ay, expre&s;&s;ing di&s;dain and &s;elf-conceit, &s;hould, from the &s;en|&s;ible in&s;tructions of her parents, be convinced of her own folly; or if di&s;tre&s;&s;es and &s;ickne&s;s obliged her to endea|vour to render her&s;elf agreeable to others, by being mild, affable and mannerly, &s;o that &s;he &s;hould become quite the contrary to what &s;he is at pre&s;ent; and &s;uppo&s;e it were the &s;ame with your other little friends, as to the faults that you find in them al&s;o; would tho&s;e marks of pride, affectation or impudence remain &s;till upon their faces? Or when, by continual and redoubled efforts they &s;hould have changed their vices into the oppo&s;ite virtues, would the &s;ame alteration take place in their countenances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the truth may lie between our dif|ferent ways of arguing. Socrates, when young, yielded to the folly of his pa&s;&s;ions, and even retained for a long time his choleric temper, &s;ince he entreated his friends to admoni&s;h him, whenever they &s;aw him ready to give way to it. But in a more advanced age, when he had been in&s;tructed in the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, he began undoubtedly to combat his vices, to reform him&s;elf daily, and to ri&s;e by degrees to the highe&s;t pitch of perfect on in every mo|ral virtue. But then it was too late to new-model his features. The mu&s;cles and fibres of his face becoming &s;tiff, the beauty of his mind could make no impre&s;&s;ion through his countenance. It was like the &s;un in a cloudy &s;ky. Now in childhood, when the features are more ten|der and flexible, the different movements of the &s;oul are in their turns forcibly impre&s;&s;ed on them. So that if by a reform during that period the virtues take place of the vices in the mind, the outward expre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e virtues on the countenance will al&s;o efface that of the vices. For
<PB N="70" REF="74">the countenance may be compared to a thin veil. If you throw it over the head of a fair Circa&s;&s;ian, and afterwards over that of a Negro wench, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee through it the florid bloom of the one, and the &s;ooty blackne&s;s of the other. I do not know whether you under&s;tand what I mean.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, perfectly from that compari&s;on; and to &s;hew you that I do, I will give you one of my own.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you &s;urprize me. But even though your compari&s;on &s;hould not be quite exact, it is certainly true that if we do not take up a habit of virtue until an advanced age, we &s;hall appear the le&s;s amiable in the eyes of others; becau&s;e our features, long accu&s;tomed to expre&s;s our former vicious inclinations, can with difficulty be modelled to repre&s;ent our pre&s;ent virtuous &s;entiments: and what are we to conclude from this?</P>

<P>That we &s;hould&mdash;that we &s;hould&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I &s;ee that we &s;hould &s;trive to be really what we wi&s;h to appear. So, for in&s;tance, if we would appear mild, mode&s;t, re&s;erved, or good-natured, we &s;hould &s;truggle again&s;t all tho&s;e inclinations that would hinder us to be &s;o in effect, otherwi&s;e our counterfeit looks will &s;oon be di&s;covered.

<P>Very well, my dear Arabella. And is not that an excellent receipt for obtaining true beauty, and the genuine art of plea&s;ing?

There|fore,
<PB N="71" REF="75">my dear, take my advice; do not go to &s;eek in your gla&s;s for the art of appearing better than you really are. But whenever you find your&s;elf ruffled by any pa&s;|&s;ion, run immediately and con&s;ult it. You will &s;ee the ugline&s;s of envy, anger or vanity.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, child, take care how you do &s;o. The fir&s;t would be contrary to good manners, and un&s;uitable to the mode&s;ty of your &s;ex; and the &s;econd would be very dangerous, con&s;idering your candour and inexpe|rience. To di&s;cover in the features of any per&s;on his di&s;po&s;ition or way of thinking, requires long &s;tudy, re|peated ob&s;ervations, and a very penetrating judgment. You would find your&s;elf continually deceived in your likings or di&s;likes. The knowledge of the world will in&s;truct you by degrees. At pre&s;ent &s;tudy only your&s;elf, and u&s;e all the &s;trength of your mind to acquire every virtue, in order to become more amiable and more beau|tiful.</P>

<HEAD>NARCISSUS AND HIPPOLYTUS.</HEAD>
<P>NARCISSUS and Hippolytus were nearly of the &s;ame age, and loved each other from their earlie&s;t infancy. As their parents were clo&s;e neighbours, they had opportunities of being together every day. Mr. Chambers, the father of Narci&s;&s;us, had a place under government, the profits of which were immen&s;e; but the father of Hippolytus, Mr. Marvel, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a moderate fortune, on which, however, he lived content, and all his views aimed at making his &s;on happy by the advan|tages of a well directed education, &s;ince he had it not in
<PB N="72" REF="76">his power to leave him great riches. To obtain this end, he made choice of means the mo&s;t worthy of his pru|dence. Hippolytus, at nine years of age, was formed to all the exerci&s;es of the body, and his under&s;tanding en|riched with many u&s;eful acquirements. Being con&s;tantly in exerci&s;e and motion, he was healthy and robu&s;t. Al|ways contented, and happy in the affection of his parents, he enjoyed a mild chearfulne&s;s which communicated its influence to the&s;e who had the happine&s;s of being in his company. His little neighbour Narci&s;&s;us was one who felt this happine&s;s; for the moment that Hippolytus left him, he would be quite at a lo&s;s for amu&s;ement. That his time might not hang weari&s;ome, he was continually eating without being hungry, drinking without being dry, and dozing without being &s;leepy. So that &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed but he was troubled with qualms of the &s;to|mach, or violent head-achs. Mr. Chambers, as well as Mr. Marvel, tenderly wi&s;hed his &s;on's happine&s;s; but to procure it he had unfortunately taken the means which were quite oppo&s;ite to his end. Narci&s;&s;us from the cradle had been bred up with the utmo&s;t delicacy. He had al|ways a &s;ervant behind him, to hand him a chair whenever he had a mind to change his &s;eat. He was dre&s;t and un|dre&s;t as if he had not the u&s;e of his hands. It &s;eemed as if all tho&s;e who were about him only breathed for him, and that he could not help him&s;elf even to live. While Hippolytus, in a thin linen jacket, helped his father to cultivate a little garden for his amu&s;ement, Narci&s;&s;us, in a fine &s;carlet coat, was lolling in a chariot, paying morn|ing vi&s;its with his mama. If ever he went to take the country air, and alighted out of the carriage but for a moment, they took particular care to put his great coat on, and a handkerchief round his head, for fear he &s;hould catch cold. Accu&s;tomed as he was to be humoured in his &s;lighte&s;t fancies, he wi&s;hed for every thing that he &s;aw; but this wi&s;h la&s;ted only for a moment; and the more trouble&s;ome it was to procure him what he wi&s;hed, the &s;ooner he was tired of it. To &s;pare him the &s;malle&s;t &s;ubject of ill humour, his mother had ordered all the &s;er|vants to re&s;pect even his follies. This ill-judged indul|gence made him &s;o whim&s;ical and imperious that every body in the hou&s;e hated and de&s;pi&s;ed him. Be&s;ides his parents, Hippolytus was the only per&s;on that loved him
<PB N="73" REF="77">and could patiently put up with his humours. He knew how to manage his temper, and could make him even good humoured like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>How do you contrive to be always &s;o merry? &s;aid Mr. Chambers to him one day. I do not well know, &s;ir, an|&s;wered he. It comes of it&s;elf. But my papa tells me, that one is never perfectly happy, without mixing a little work with one's play. And I have ob&s;erved it, too, whenever any &s;trangers come to our hou&s;e, and we quit our work to entertain them: I never find my time hang heavy but on &s;uch days. It is this mixture of exerci&s;e and amu&s;ement that makes me always be in good health. I fear neither the winds, nor the rain; neither the heat of the day, nor the cold of the evening; and I have almo&s;t dug up a whole plat in my garden, before poor Narci&s;&s;us quits his bed of a morning. Mr. Chambers heaved a &s;igh; and that very day he went to con&s;ult Mr. Marvel how he &s;hould act, in order to make his &s;on as healthy and as chearful as Hippo|lytus. Mr. Marvel took plea&s;ure in an&s;wering his que&s;|tions, and laid before him the plan that he had followed. The powers of the body and of the mind, &s;aid he, &s;hould be equally kept in exerci&s;e, unle&s;s they are meant to be un&s;erviceable, as money buried in the ground would be even to its owner. Nothing can be imagined more pre|judicial to the health and happine&s;s of children, than to give them a pu&s;illanimous turn, by u&s;ing them to exce&s;|&s;ive delicacy; and from a pernicious complai&s;ance, to give way to their whim&s;ical and ob&s;tinate humours. To what vexatious di&s;appointments will not a man be ex|po&s;ed, who has been accu&s;tomed from his childhood to &s;ee even his follies flattered; &s;ince of all the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of his heart, he may happen to &s;ee &s;carcely one accompli&s;hed, and thus be led ba&s;ely to murmur again&s;t his de&s;tiny, when he &s;hould for the mo&s;t part thank heaven for rejecting his infatuated vows? He added, with tokens of heart-felt &s;atisfaction, that Hippolytus would certainly never be that unhappy per&s;on. Mr. Chambers was &s;truck with this di&s;cour&s;e, and re&s;olved to conduct his &s;on to happine&s;s by the &s;ame way. Alas! it was too late. Narci&s;&s;us now was fourteen years old, and his mind, &s;o long enervated, could not bear any exertion, though ever &s;o little fatiguing. His mother, as weak as him&s;elf, entreated her hu&s;band not to teaze their darling.
<PB N="74" REF="78">Her hu&s;band, wearied out with the&s;e entreaties, dropped the &s;en&s;ible de&s;ign that he had formed; and the darling &s;unk more and more into habits of pernicious effemi|nacy. Thus the &s;trength of his body declined, in pro|portion as his mind was degraded by ignorance. At &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, when he had gained the age of &s;eventeen, his pa|rents &s;ent him to the univer&s;ity, intending him after|wards for the &s;tudy of the law. Hippolytus being de&s;|tined for the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, accompanied his young friend. I had forgot to mention that Hippolytus, in his different &s;tudies and acquirements, had never had any other in&s;tructor than his father. Narci&s;&s;us had as many ma&s;ters as there are different accompli&s;hments to acquire; and he remembered a few of the terms u&s;ed by each of them tolerably well. This was all the fruit of his &s;tudies. The under&s;tanding of Hippolytus, on the contrary, was like a garden who&s;e airy &s;ituation every where admits the kindly rays of the &s;un, and in which every &s;eed, by a judicious cultivation, comes rapidly to the growth. Al|ready well in&s;tructed, he earne&s;tly de&s;ired fre&s;h know|ledge. His diligence and good behaviour afforded a pat|tern for imitation to his companions. His mild temper, his lively apprehen&s;ion and joyous humour, made his company &s;trongly attracting. Every body loved him, and every body wi&s;hed to be his friend. Narci&s;&s;us at fir&s;t was happy to be in the &s;ame lodging with him. But very &s;oon his pride, mortified by the e&s;teem that Hippo|lytus had acquired, would not &s;uffer him to be longer a witne&s;s to it. He therefore &s;eparated from him upon a frivoious pretence. Being now left to him&s;elf, and his own vitiated ta&s;te, he &s;ighed for plea&s;ure, and thought|le&s;sly &s;natched at whatever &s;eemed to offer her deceitful image to his view. I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe to you how often he blu&s;hed for him&s;elf, and how from one imprudence to another, he fell at la&s;t into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t irregularities. It will &s;uffice to inform you that he re|turned to his father's hou&s;e with the &s;eeds of a mortal di&s;temper in his bo&s;om; that he langui&s;hed &s;ix months on a bed of pain, and expired in the &s;evere&s;t agonies. Hippolytus came home to his parents, regretted both by his teachers and his companions, and enriched with a trea&s;ure of learning and prudence. With what tran&s;|ports of joy was he received by his family! O children,
<PB N="75" REF="79">how &s;weet a thing it is to make our&s;elves beloved by all who know us, and at the &s;ame time to feel our&s;elves wor|thy of this univer&s;al affection! His mother thought her|&s;elf the happie&s;t of women; and tears of joy filled his father's eyes whenever he beheld him. A con&s;iderable employment in his profe&s;&s;ion was conferred on him with the unanimous approbation of all who knew his charac|ter, and enabled him to gratify his ardent de&s;ire of pro|moting the happine&s;s of his friends. And he enjoyed their happine&s;s as much as they did them&s;elves. His parents, too, &s;hared the &s;ame generous &s;entiments, and lived in affluence to a good old age. He took plea&s;ure in repaying them with intere&s;t the attentions which they had &s;hewed for him. A wife endowed with beauty and virtue, and children re&s;embling him&s;elf, made his hap|pine&s;s complete. Whenever, therefore, any man was mentioned as being both happy and worthy to be &s;o, the name of Hippolytus always occurred fir&s;t to the thoughts of tho&s;e who knew him.</P>

<P>ONE fine evening, in the month of June, Mr. Ru&s;&s;el went out with his &s;on Eugene, to take a walk in &s;ome of the mo&s;t agreeable environs of the city. The weather was mild, the &s;ky clear, the purling &s;treams and waving trees lulled them to an agreeable thoughtfulne&s;s. What a lovely evening! &s;aid Eugene, enchanted with the beauties of nature that &s;urrounded him. He pre&s;&s;ed his father's hand, and &s;aid to him, If you knew, papa, what thoughts ri&s;e in my heart! He was &s;ilent for a mo|ment, then lifting up towards heaven his eyes which were moi&s;tened with tears. I thank my God, &s;aid he, for the happy moments that he gives me to enjoy.

<P>It does not always happen &s;o, my dear. There are &s;ome fortunate per&s;ons who remember their pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and in whom this reflection produces &s;en|timents of charity towards the unfortunate. But to the di&s;grace of the human heart, a change of fortune fre|quently alters affections the mo&s;t tender and &s;ympathetic. While we are unfortunate our&s;elves, we think that hea|ven requires it of all men as a duty to relieve our &s;uffer|ings. If the hand of God remove misfortune from us, we conclude all his intents in the pre&s;ervation of the uni|ver&s;e to be fulfilled; and we no longer think of tho&s;e wretches that remain in the gulf from which we have been re&s;cued. We have an in&s;tance of this in the man who comes &s;ometimes to a&s;k relief of me. I give it to him with a reluctance that I cannot conquer, though I reproach my&s;elf for it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Ru&s;&s;el.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will &s;hew you, my dear, whether he de|&s;erves them. Mr. Lowe was a linen-draper in the Mino|ries. Though the profits of his bu&s;ine&s;s were but mode|rate, a poor per&s;on never appeared at his door in vain. This was all the plea&s;ure that he indulged him&s;elf in pur|cha&s;ing; and he thought him&s;elf happy to enjoy it, though he could not command even this to the full extent of his wi&s;hes. Bu&s;ine&s;s called him one day upon Change. He &s;aw in one part of it a number of principal merchants together, who were talking of va&s;t cargoes, and immen&s;e profits to be expected from them. Ah! &s;aid he to him&s;elf, &s;ighing, how happy the&s;e people are! If I were as rich, heaven knows, I &s;hould not be &s;o for my&s;elf alone, and that the poor &s;hould partake of my abundance. He goes home full of ambitious thoughts, but how can his narrow bu&s;ine&s;s enable him to fulfil his<PB N="77" REF="81">va&s;t projects? With tolerable oeconomy, it was no more than &s;ufficient to afford him a decent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound. "I &s;hall always be at a &s;tand here!" cried he, "and never ri&s;e above this middling condition in which I linger at pre&s;ent." A hand-bill, inviting adventurers to purcha&s;e in the lottery, was at this moment put into his hand. He &s;eized the idea with eagerne&s;s, as if in|&s;pired by fortune; and without minding the inconvenience to which his covetou&s;ne&s;s might reduce him, he went to the lottery-office, and laid out four guineas, the only money that he could &s;pare in the world. With what impatience he waited for the drawing! He one time re|pented having &s;o fooli&s;hly hazarded a &s;take, the lo&s;s of which would di&s;turb him.

<P>Aha! he would jump for joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ru&s;&s;el.</SPEAKER>
<P>He went immediately and received his mo|ney, and &s;pent &s;ome days in thinking of nothing el&s;e. When he had had enough of that, I can put this &s;um to a better u&s;e, &s;aid he, than barely poring over it. He therefore enlarged his &s;tock, extended his dealings, and by his ac|tivity and knowledge of trade he &s;oon doubled his capital. In le&s;s than ten years he became one of the riche&s;t men in the city. It mu&s;t be &s;aid in his prai&s;e, that he had till then been faithful to his vow, in making the poor partake of his abundance. At the fight of an unfortunate per&s;on he remembered his own former condition without being a&s;hamed of it. And this recollection never failed of pro|fiting the per&s;on who occa&s;ioned it. Led by degrees to frequent fine company, he contracted a ta&s;te for luxury and di&s;&s;ipation. He purcha&s;ed a magnificent country|hou&s;e and fine gardens, and his life became a round of plea&s;ures and amu&s;ement. The mo&s;t extravagant whims he gratified without &s;cruple, but &s;oon perceived that they had made a con&s;iderable breach in his fortune. Trade, which he had given up in order to be quite at lei&s;ure to enjoy him&s;elf, no longer enabled him to repair it. Be|&s;ides, a habit of indulgence and a mean vanity would not &s;uffer him to le&s;&s;en his expences. I &s;hall always have enough for one, thought he; let others provide for them|&s;elves.
<PB N="78" REF="82">His heart, hardened in this re&s;olution, was thenceforth &s;hut to the unfortunate. He heard the cries of mi&s;ery around him, as one hears the tempe&s;t grumble, when &s;heltered from its fury. Friends whom he had till then &s;upported, came to &s;olicit him for fre&s;h relief. But he refu&s;ed them har&s;hly. Have I made a fortune, &s;aid he, only to &s;quander it upon you? Do as I do, &s;aid he, depend upon your&s;elves. His mother, whom he had cut &s;hort of half the pen&s;ion that he allowed her, came to beg for a retired &s;helter in a corner of his hou&s;e, there to &s;pend her few remaining days; but he had the barbarity to refu&s;e her, and with dry eyes beheld her die in mi&s;ery. This crime, however, did not long remain unpuni&s;hed. His debaucheries very &s;oon exhau&s;ted all his wealth, and deprived him of the &s;trength nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport him&s;elf by work. In &s;hort, he was reduced to the &s;tate of mi&s;ery in which you &s;ee him, and now begs his bread from door to door, an object of contempt and indignation to all hone&s;t people.</P>

<P>Ah! papa, &s;ince fortune can make men &s;o wicked, I wi&s;h to remain as I am.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Ru&s;&s;el.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Eugene, I wi&s;h the &s;ame for the &s;ake of your happine&s;s; but if heaven de&s;tines you to a more exalted &s;tation, may you never for&s;eit the noblene&s;s and genero&s;ity of your &s;oul. Think often of the &s;tory that I have ju&s;t now told you. Learn from this example, that we can never ta&s;te true happine&s;s, without feeling for the misfortunes of others; that it is the powerful man's duty to comfort the &s;orrows of the weak; and that he reaps more true happine&s;s from the performance of this duty, than from all his pomp and luxury.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now going to &s;et, and his parting beams threw a lively glow upon the clouds which &s;eemed to form a purple curtain round his bed. The air, fre&s;hened at the approach of evening, breathed an agreeable calm. The birds, in repeating their farewel &s;ongs, rallied all their powers of melody. The leaves of the grove mingled a gentle murmur with their concert, and every thing &s;eemed to in&s;pire &s;entiments of joy and happine&s;s; but Eugene and his father, in&s;tead of the tran&s;ports which they had felt at fir&s;t, returned home lo&s;t in melancholy reflexions.</P>

<P>Yes, another time when we have nothing to lo&s;e. I could not &s;leep a quarter of an hour together all la&s;t night.

<P>Dear &s;i&s;ter, it makes me doubly unhappy to &s;ee you grieve &s;o. I would give all that I am worth in the world to have her again.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eu&s;tace.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd lay a wager &s;he followed me into this &s;treet, and almo&s;t as far as our own hou&s;e too. But as &s;he runs up into every court &s;melling about, &s;omebody mu&s;t have &s;hut their door upon her and kept her in.</P>

<P>Lionel was along with me, and declared to me that he &s;aw her but the moment before we mi&s;&s;ed her. And it was his fault; for he was playing &s;uch comical tricks as we walked along, that I forgot Diana ju&s;t then.</P>

<P>No, no; &s;he is a very hone&s;t woman, and a good friend of mine. You know, Eu&s;tace, that Diana too wanted t'other day to &s;crape acquaintance with her, &s;tanding up with her paws upon the counter, and &s;melling at the bi&s;cuits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eu&s;tace.</SPEAKER>

<P>Nay, I only tell you her own words. That little cur dog, &s;ays &s;he, that belongs to that pretty young gentleman, your acquaintance? Yes, &s;aid I, the &s;ame. Well, you know another little ma&s;ter that lives here be|low,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lionel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you remember that he was at the old woman's &s;hop ye&s;terday as we pa&s;&s;ed, and pretended not to &s;ee us, for fear of being obliged to offer us &s;ome of his walnuts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eu&s;tace.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true. I recollect it now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lionel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, when we had pa&s;t her hou&s;e a little way, he called Diana as &s;he was following us, and offered her a bit of cake, and while the poor thing was bu&s;y fea&s;ting her&s;elf, he &s;natched her up in his arms and carried her home. The good woman told me the whole trick.</P>

<P>I am greatly afraid that he would not find her there. Rufus has taken her only to &s;ell her, as he does his books and whatever el&s;e he can purloin at his father's. He is capable of any thing. Why, we were playing at marbles t'other day, and he cheated.</P>

<P>Always pre&s;erve the&s;e &s;entiments, my dear children, one towards the other, and indeed towards all your fellow-creatures, for they are of the &s;ame family. I know many per&s;ons who, for &s;uch a trifle, would have turned away an hone&s;t &s;ervant.</P>

<P>Why do not all men make that difference as well as you, my dear child?

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, I thank you. I have &s;uffered too much from the lo&s;s of Diana. If &s;he does not come back, I will never have another. I will not run the ri&s;que of grieving &s;o again.</P>

<P>You carry things too far, my dear Serina. In that ca&s;e we mu&s;t re&s;ign all the mo&s;t agreeable plea|&s;ures of life. We &s;hould be afraid to love a friend, be|cau&s;e death or ab&s;ence might one day &s;eparate us from him. If you compare the plea&s;ure which Diana's play|ful fondne&s;s has afforded you ever &s;ince &s;he was born, to the &s;hort unea&s;ine&s;s that her lo&s;s occa&s;ions to you now, the fir&s;t you will find exceeds the &s;econd by a great deal.

<P>I can &s;ay nothing as to that; but, I &s;hould think, his confu&s;ion could not come from a very clear con|&s;cience. However, that we may have no reproach to make to our&s;elves, concerning Diana, we mu&s;t adverti&s;e her to-morrow in the public papers.</P>

<P>No, it cannot be u&s;ele&s;s. A dog requires to be fed, and is not &s;o &s;mall or &s;o quiet that one can hide it from every body's eyes. There may happen to be &s;ome per&s;on in his hou&s;e hone&s;t enough to give us information of it. I will not apply to his father, I know his rude manners too well.

<HEAD>THE HEN.</HEAD>
<P>HOW happy was Cyprian in &s;o worthy and affectionate a father as Mr. Ti&s;dall. Whenever he had &s;hown him&s;elf for any length of time di&s;creet and diligent, he was a&s;&s;ured that his father would not fail to te&s;tify his &s;atisfaction with &s;ome recompence or other. Cyprian had a ta&s;te for gardening, and began, about the age of twelve, to cultivate choice flowers. His father &s;aw it, and imme|diately began to &s;tudy how he might afford his &s;on more plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>They were both at dinner. Cyprian, &s;aid his father, your preceptor has informed me, that you have begun this very day to read the Roman Hi&s;tory, and the Geography of Italy. If, in a week, you can but give me an exact account of every thing you may have learned on the&s;e two &s;ubjects, you cannot think what I intend &s;hall recompence your application!</P>
<P>Cyprian, one may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, did not forget &s;uch a promi&s;e. He employed him&s;elf in &s;tudying all the week, to get this recompence; or rather, he received &s;uch plea|&s;ure from his &s;tudy, that indeed it was he who &s;hould have be&s;towed a recompence on his Papa if he had been able.</P>
<P>He &s;aw the day of trial come, without anxiety; and underwent the examination like an hero. He had learned the hi&s;tory of all the kings of Rome, and marked out in his map the gradual progre&s;s of that growing empire.</P>
<P>In a tran&s;port of delight, his father took him by the hand, embraced and ki&s;&s;ed him. Come, &s;ays he, &s;ince you have &s;ought to give me &s;o much plea&s;ure, it is but ju&s;t that I &s;hould contribute in my turn to yours. Saying this, he led him into an adjoining garden, pointed out a vacant &s;pot to him, and told him that it was to be his. You may part it in two, continued he; and plant what flowers you like in one, and any vegetables that you think proper in the other. After this, they went into an out-hou&s;e, clo&s;e behind the gardener's hut, where Cyprian found a &s;pade, a watering-pot, a rake, and other implements of garden|ing, all perfectly adapted to his &s;ize and &s;trength. On the walls were ba&s;kets hung up, of every &s;ize, great and &s;mall,
<PB N="98" REF="106">and on &s;helves about them, &s;undry boxes full of roots, and bags of &s;eeds; the whole together duly ticketed, with cards on every box and bag, marking the proper time for &s;owing each article.</P>
<P>One &s;hould be of Cyprian's age to know the exce&s;s of his joy upon this occa&s;ion. In his mind, the little &s;pot of earth which his father had a&s;&s;igned him, was as great as monarchs think their kingdoms; and whatever hours of relaxation his preceptor let him take, and which he &s;pent before in folly, were now taken up in cultivating his domain.</P>
<P>One day, when he came in from doing &s;omething about his garden he forgot to &s;hut the gate. A hen was pecking near the &s;pot, and took it in her head to go a hunting on his grounds. The flower-bed had been &s;trewed but lately with a layer of the riche&s;t mould, and was con&s;equently quite full of worms.</P>
<P>The hen, charmed with &s;uch delicious fare, began to &s;cratch the mould up, and employ her beak as well as talons to unearth the worms; and in particular, &s;he took a mighty inclination to a part, where Cyprian had, the day, before been planting &s;ome fine pinks.</P>
<P>How great therefore was the exce&s;s of his rage when coming back to his plantation, he beheld the door a jar, and this new-fa&s;hioned gardener digging up his beds? Ah! ah! you impudent &s;lut! &s;aid he; your bones &s;hall pay for this. And immediately he &s;hut the door, for fear his victim &s;hould e&s;cape, and picking up flint &s;tones, &s;and, clods of earth, and whatever he could lay hold of, he threw them at the bird, pur&s;uing her all the while as clo&s;e as he could.</P>
<P>The frightened hen, at one time ran with all her &s;peed, and at another time &s;trove to fly upon the wall, but found that her wings would not befriend her in reaching &s;uch a height. Unhappily, &s;he fell back more than once on Cyprian's flowers, and got her wings and feet entangled with the fine&s;t hyacinths.</P>
<P>Young Cyprian, beholding her thus embroiled, &s;up|po&s;ed that he had her fa&s;t. Two rows of tulips &s;eparated them. His anger was &s;o vehement, that &s;tepping over, as he meant to do, this interval of &s;eparation between the hen and him, he trod them down him&s;elf. The hen, however, at her enemy's approach, redoubled her former
<PB N="99" REF="107">efforts, and attempted now a &s;econd time to gain the wall. She ro&s;e a great deal higher than before, yet &s;till came &s;hort; but what was matter of regret for Cyprian, bore away with her from underneath as &s;he ro&s;e, a beautiful ro&s;e-bud-coloured ten-belled hyacinth. On this, he &s;eized his rake, and flung it at the bird with all his &s;trength. The rake turned round, and while he fancied it upon the point of hitting the fugitive mark, it came down, and da&s;hed two panes of gla&s;s to pieces in a melon frame, as well as broke out two of its own teeth upon the ground.</P>
<P>The little Fury, made much more furious by the&s;e damages, had run for his &s;pade, and now the combat would perhaps have had fatal con&s;equences for his feather|ed adver&s;ary, who fatigued and giddy had crept in be|tween a ro&s;e-bu&s;h and the wall, if Mr. Ti&s;dall, at fir&s;t attracted to his window by the noi&s;e, had not made ha&s;te to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The moment Cyprian &s;aw his father, he &s;tood &s;tock &s;till in evident confu&s;ion; however he made &s;hift to find his tongue at la&s;t, and cried out, See, papa, what ravage this vile creature has committed in my garden.</P>
<P>Had you &s;hut the door replied his father with an affect|ed indifference, this ravage would not have been made. I &s;aw your whole behaviour. Are you not a&s;hamed of ha|ving put forth all your &s;trength again&s;t a harmle&s;s hen? She has no <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to conduct her&s;elf, and though &s;he has rooted up your pinks, it was not with a wi&s;h to do you any damage, but to get her ordinary food. Now, Cyprian, &s;hould you have put your&s;elf thus into a pa&s;&s;ion, if &s;he had &s;cratched up nothing but as many nettle roots? And how can &s;he di&s;tingui&s;h between pinks and nettles? It is your|&s;elf alone that are to blame for all this havock. With precaution you would certainly have driven her out &s;o that &s;he might do no further mi&s;chief; and in that ca&s;e, neither your rake, nor my melon frame, would have gone to ruin, or your lo&s;s have exceeded that of a few flowers. Therefore you alone are puni&s;hable, &s;o that were I to cut a branch off from this hazle-tree, and with it make you &s;uffer ju&s;t what you de&s;igned the hen &s;hould &s;uffer&mdash;which of us would act with the greate&s;t ju&s;tice? I &s;hall not, how|ever, go to this extremity, purpo&s;ely to &s;hew you that we may all &s;uppre&s;s our re&s;entment, if we think proper. Notwith&s;tanding, for the damage done to my melon frame,
<PB N="100" REF="108">I &s;hall deduct as much as will repair it, from the arrears of your allowance in my hands; for I am not to &s;uffer through your ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Cyprian, upon this, withdrew much aba&s;hed, and all day dur&s;t &s;carcely lift his eyes up, while before his father.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Mr. Ti&s;dall propo&s;ed a walk, and a&s;ked if he de&s;ired to join him. Cyprian followed, but oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;adne&s;s which he &s;ought in vain to hide. His father &s;aw it, and affecting a degree of wonder, wi&s;hed to know why he appeared &s;o grievou&s;ly dejected.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I not the greate&s;t cau&s;e to be dejected? For this whole month pa&s;t, I have denied my&s;elf &s;o many plea&s;ures, merely to buy &s;omething for my &s;i&s;ter.

<SPEAKER>Mr. Ti&s;dall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare &s;ay, you would have been delighted to oblige your &s;i&s;ter, but my melon frame, however, mu&s;t be paid for fir&s;t.

<P>Ah! you may depend upon it, &s;ir, I will ne|ver leave the garden-door open again, or take revenge upon a hen for what would be my own omi&s;&s;ion.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! no, no; for look ye, not above a week ago I left my map upon the table while I went a walking, and my little &s;i&s;ter coming into the room, with a pen and ink &s;o blotted it all over, that no one could di&s;tingui&s;h Europe from America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ti&s;dall.</SPEAKER>

<P>Without de&s;iring in the lea&s;t to give you a di&s;ta&s;te of life, I can a&s;&s;ure you that you will have to &s;uffer many di&s;agreeable affairs, and tho&s;e a deal more prejudicial to you, than the mi&s;chiefs cau&s;ed by the hen. Mankind always &s;eek their intere&s;t and their plea&s;ures,
<PB N="101" REF="109">ju&s;t as hens &s;eek worms; and they will do &s;o at the hazard of your intere&s;ts, as hens will at the hazard of your flowers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee it plainly, &s;ir, by Bella's behaviour; &s;ince the little plea&s;ure that &s;he received from &s;cribbling on a bit of paper, has occa&s;ioned me the lo&s;s of an extremely u&s;eful map.</P>

<P>But could you not have avoided this lo&s;s, by putting up your map before you left the apartment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ti&s;dall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then think for the future to conduct your|&s;elf &s;o, that no body may have power to do you any real mi&s;chief; but if after all, in &s;pite of your precaution, you &s;hould be &s;o unlucky as to receive an injury, con&s;ider how you may endure it, &s;o as not to render the fir&s;t wrong &s;till more prejudicial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, papa; but how mu&s;t I endure it?</P>
</SP>

<P>With indifference, if it be a &s;light injury, but, on the other hand, if a great one, with courage. Now that we are by our&s;elves, I dare propo&s;e you as an example the conduct that I pur&s;ue towards Mr. Hotham.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't &s;peak of him, papa. The&s;e two years pa&s;t, he takes no notice of you whenever you meet each other, and there cannot be a fal&s;ity that he will not &s;ay to prejudice you in the opinion of the world.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I never yet dur&s;t a&s;k you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ti&s;dall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but for the preference which I obtained re&s;pecting an employ that my father had &s;o wor|thily filled up for five and thirty years, and to which he had affectionately formed me by the mo&s;t diligent in&s;truction. Mr. Hotham had no title to the po&s;t, except his ignorance and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency. My right &s;ucceeded, notwith&s;tanding all his intere&s;t, and therefore am I honoured with his calum|ny and hatred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, were I as big as you, I'd teach him better manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ti&s;dall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary, I let him go on rail|ing at me ju&s;t as he thinks fit. The conduct which you &s;hould have pur&s;ued, when you were injured by the hen, I faithfully pur&s;ue towards him. The pinks that &s;he &s;cratched up by the roots, in &s;eeking for worms, may
<PB N="102" REF="110">repre&s;ent the reputable character that I bear, and which in order to gratify the worm of Envy that gnaws him, he labours to undo. Were I to &s;eek the means of puni&s;hing him, I &s;hould trample under foot that deference and re&s;pect which I owe to my&s;elf, as you trod under foot your tulips. The me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on frame and rake which you damaged, are that wealth and peace of mind that I &s;hould de&s;troy, by hurry|ing on to vengeance. Taught in future by the lo&s;&s;es that you have &s;uffered, you will &s;hut the garden door, in order to keep the hen out. Taught too by the wicked di&s;po&s;i|tion of my enemy, I lay, by means of proper conduct on my part, an in&s;uperable barrier between us. Thus in|acce&s;&s;ible to his vindictive attempts, I enjoy the comforts of my moderation, while he &s;pends him&s;elf in tho&s;e at|tempts, and will in time experience the compunction of his evil con&s;cience. Could his in&s;ults vex me, I &s;hould make my&s;elf the victim that he would &s;acrifice, and be reproached for imbecility, by every worthy character of my acquaintance; while on the other hand the in&s;en&s;ibili|ty that I manife&s;t for his injurious treatment yields him to his own contempt, and, in the bo&s;om of good men, keeps up the reputation that I have gained among them.</P>

<P>For this ble&s;&s;ing, you and they are debtors to the king. I have done nothing but &s;olicited his bounty, wi&s;hing that I might prove the channel through which it &s;hould flow. Hearing accidentally, dear madam, of your application, I determined to &s;upport it with my little in|tere&s;t, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to get more than was &s;olicited. You owe this interference to my knowledge of the captain's merit; being, as I was, convinced how much he had in|&s;tructed his inferior officers, and been of benefit to tho&s;e above him. Upon this account, I did not think it rea|&s;onable that he &s;hould &s;till be forced to &s;erve among us, when his infirmity made &s;ervice painful to him. And &s;till more, to &s;hew how heartily I pro&s;ecuted this affair, with plea&s;ure I took advantage of our march &s;o near his habi|tation, to bring down my&s;elf the news of my &s;ucce&s;s, and glad the bo&s;om of his &s;pou&s;e and children with it.

<HEAD>GEORGE AND CECILIA.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE George, an orphan, had been brought up from his infancy by L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy Eu&s;tace, who, together with Lord Eu&s;tace, were retired from London, and re&s;ided in a &s;mall country town. From the tenderne&s;s with which they treated him, a &s;tranger in the family would have imagined him to be really their &s;on. This worthy couple had but one child left them, and that a girl, named Ce|cilia, who was nearly of an age with George: and Lady Eu&s;tace had the &s;atisfaction to behold a more than com|mon mutual &s;ondne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the children.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="142">One delightful morning, towards the end of Augu&s;t, George and Cecilia, with their little friend Lucinda, who&s;e parents lived that &s;ummer in the neighbourhood, were out a &s;auntering in the orchard. The two little girls, of which the younge&s;t (namely Cecilia) was not yet quite eight years old, were arm in arm; and walking with that lovely negligence and tho&s;e un&s;tudied graces &s;o peculiar to a &s;tate of childhood, they hummed over a de|lightful roundelay, then fa&s;hionable in the mouth of every &s;ong&s;ter in the village, while little George preceded them at lei&s;ure, piping on an Engli&s;h flute, to harmonize their di&s;cords.</P>
<P>What a &s;eries of delightful gambols entertained them in the or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hard! But at la&s;t, our Cecilia and Lucinda both ca&s;t a longing look upon the fruit-trees round about them. In particular, an apple-tree attracted their atten|tion. All the apples had been gathered &s;everal days be|fore; but &s;till, a few that had been overlooked, were here and there di&s;covered hanging, and the deep vermillion that tinged them, and which the leaves could not entirely hide, invited, as it were, the hand to come and take them. George &s;prung forward, climbed the tree which they were admiring, and threw down as many apples as his hand c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld reach, while the children held their aprons open to receive them.</P>
<P>Chance &s;o ordered it, that two or three of what were thought the fine&s;t fell into Lacinda's, who piqued her|&s;elf upon this accidental di&s;tribution, as &s;he might have done with rea&s;on, had it been a pre-determined prefer|ence, &s;ince George was in reality the prettie&s;t and polite&s;t little fellow in the place.</P>
<P>Lucinda, with a joy and triumph in her eyes, that looked like in&s;ult, thus addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Cecilia: "Do but &s;ee how fine and large my apples are, while yours are hardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf &s;o h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ome!" Cecilia, at the&s;e words, hung down her head, and putting on a &s;erious countenance, kept &s;ilence during the remainder of their wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k. It was in vain that George &s;tudied, by a hundred a&s;&s;iduties, to bring the little maiden back to rea&s;on, to &s;pread a &s;mile again upon her cloaded countenance, and to make tho&s;e lips pronounce a &s;yilable, who&s;e prattle ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> till then been &s;o agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="143">Not long after this, Lucinda took leave when they had got upon the terrace, and were near home. Before they entered, George addre&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter, as he always called her, a&s;king why &s;he &s;eemed &s;o angry with him? Certainly you cannot be offended, &s;aid he, that Lucinda had her &s;hare of the apples? You know very well, I have always loved you mo&s;t, and would have &s;hewn it in the tree, by throwing you the fine&s;t apples; but I know not how it chanced, my dear, they fell into Mi&s;s Lucinda's apron. Could I take them from her? A&s;k your&s;elf that que&s;tion. And be&s;ides, I thought you far more generous than to take offence at &s;uch a trifle! You &s;hall &s;ee, the very fir&s;t occa&s;ion that pre&s;ents it&s;elf of &s;howing you my real &s;enti|ments, it was not my de&s;ign to vex you.</P>
<P>Hey-dey, Mr. George! &s;aid Cecilia, and who told you that I was vexed? Suppo&s;e Mi&s;s Lucinda's apples had been even ten times finer than what I had, is that any thing to me? I am no glutton, and you know that very well, &s;ir; neither &s;hould I in the lea&s;t have minded it, but for the &s;aucy little creature's looks. I'll not endure them, that I won't; and as for you, fall down upon your knees this in&s;tant, or I will never, while I live, forgive you.</P>
<P>O! I cannot do that by any means, &s;aid George, (bend|ing half his body backwards as he &s;poke) for by doing &s;o, I &s;hould confe&s;s a fault with which you have no right to charge me. I am no &s;tory-teller, and mu&s;t &s;ay, it is very wrong in you, Mi&s;s Cecilia, if you will not believe that I did not mean to vex you.</P>
<P>Very wrong in me! replied the other. Very wrong in me! What do you mean, &s;ir? But I &s;ee why you affront me thus; it is becau&s;e Mi&s;s Lucinda is your favourite. And &s;o &s;aying, and be&s;towing a contemptuous curt&s;y on him, while &s;he looked another way, &s;he went into the hou&s;e in a pet.</P>
<P>As dinner was now ready, they &s;at down, but pouted at each other all the time it la&s;ted. Cecilia did not drink even once, becau&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have &s;aid, <HI>Your good health, George.</HI> And George, on his part, was &s;o piqued at her inju&s;tice, that he al&s;o thought proper to pre&s;erve his dig|nity. And yet, the little lady would &s;teal a glance &s;till, every now and then at George, and from a corner of her eye, con&s;ider all his motions. As it happened, one of
<PB N="132" REF="144">the&s;e &s;ly glances met with one of George's, who was no le&s;s &s;lily &s;tudying Cecilia's motions. Being thus &s;ur|pri&s;ed, &s;he turned immediately towards another object; and as George took this to proceed from di&s;dain, though in reality it did not, he affected great indifference, and went on eating, ju&s;t as if he did not care a farthing for her.</P>
<P>When the cloth was removed, and the wine and &s;ruit brought in, unluckily poor Cecilia, mortified as &s;he was at George's whole behaviour, replied a little di&s;re&s;pect|fully to her mama, (who had be&s;ides been obliged to a&s;k her the que&s;tion twice over,) and &s;he was therefore ordered in&s;tantly from table. She obeyed, and bur&s;ting out into a flood of tears, withdrew, as if &s;he knew not whither &s;he was going. As the door was open that conducted to the garden, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed out that way, and, as it were by in&s;tinct, went to hide her &s;orrow in an arbour at the bot|tom of it. There, while &s;he bur&s;t out again into a flood of tears, and &s;ighed mo&s;t lamentably, &s;he repented of the quarrel that &s;he had picked with George, who always u&s;ed, upon &s;uch &s;ad occa&s;ions, to alleviate her di&s;tre&s;s by weeping with her.</P>
<P>George, remaining at the table, could not think of Ce|cilia in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and not feel greatly for her &s;ituation.

He pu&s;hed back his chair, and a&s;terwards brought it forward, more than menty times, and was continually looking down for &s;omething on the carpet. Then all of a &s;udden; Look at pretty Laura! look at Rover! cried he, &s;eeming to take notice of two dogs in the apartment; and at the &s;ame time he had got a peach ready to &s;lip into his pocket, if he could but fix my lord's and lady's ob&s;ervation upon &s;omething at a di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P>See, papa, mama, how prettily they are playing! Do but turn about; they will make you die with laughing.</P>
<P>Oh! re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my lord, they will not eat one another, that I will an&s;wer for; and having ju&s;t glanced at them, put him&s;elf &s;o &s;oon into his fir&s;t po&s;ition, that poor George,
<PB N="133" REF="145">who thought him&s;elf that moment &s;ure of pocketing the peach, was di&s;concerted, and obliged to put it down again upon the table.</P>
<P>Lady Eu&s;tace had ob&s;erved him, and conjectured his intention; therefore, having for a while enjoyed the little boy's embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;he made his lord&s;hip privy to the affair, as well as &s;he was able, and in dumb &s;how bade him turn his head on one &s;ide; which he did accordingly, but could not hide a &s;mile, that notwith&s;tanding all his gravity e&s;caped him.</P>
<P>However, George, who thought him&s;elf as yet quite un|di&s;covered, but was fearful le&s;t this device again repeated might betray him, in&s;tantly re&s;orted to another &s;tratagem. He took one peach, and placed it in the hollow of his hands put both together, after which he lifted it to his mouth, and made as if he had really been eating, by an imitation of the noi&s;e and motion which people make when they are chewing. Then, while with his left-hand he luckily found means to clap his peach into a cavity that he had hollowed beforehand in the napkin on his knees, he put his right-hand out to take the other, which he &s;erved exactly in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Some few minutes had now pa&s;&s;ed, and as it happened, my lord and lady had quite forgot little George, and were conver&s;ing with each other in their u&s;ual manner; &s;o that George, &s;uppo&s;ing this a proper opportunity to get away, ro&s;e up from table, with both peaches in the napkin, and began to imi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te the mewing of a cat, which a young &s;hepherd boy had lately taught him; and his view in this was to engage the attention both of Pompey and Rover, which he did, and put them into motion. Lady Eu&s;tace, &s;omewhat angry at the&s;e mewings, inter|rupted him. "What now!" &s;aid &s;he; and added, "Well, but George, if our di&s;cour&s;e di&s;plea&s;es you, I fancy, you may go and mew a little in the garden." George put on a feigned embarra&s;&s;ment at this reproof, which was another thing that he wanted. He runs up therefore to Laura, &s;aying, "See, mama &s;he wants to bite poor Rover!" and in turning, he dexterou&s;&s;y whipped the napkin all at once into his pocket, and pretended to run after Laura, with an intent to puni&s;h her. Laura &s;campered towards the door which Cecilia had left
<PB N="134" REF="146">open, when &s;he went into the garden, and away went Ma&s;ter George, pur&s;uing him.</P>
<P>"George! George! &s;aid Lady Eu&s;tace; pray, where are you going?" George &s;topped &s;hort. "My dear mama, &s;aid he, I will take a turn, if you plea&s;e, in the garden. Won't you let me? I am &s;ure you will give me leave." But afterwards, as her lady&s;hip returned no an|&s;wer, he lowered his voice, and in a &s;uppliant manner added, "Pray, my dear mama, do let me! You &s;hall &s;ee how well I will behave my&s;elf." "In that ca&s;e, an|&s;wered &s;he, I will give you leave. Go."</P>
<P>What words can expre&s;s the greatne&s;s of his joy! He was &s;o joyful, that not minding how he ran, his foot &s;lip|ped and he fell down. By great good luck, the peaches were not damaged in the fall. He got up again in&s;tantly, and ran to &s;eek his &s;i&s;ter in every nook and corner of the garden.</P>
<P>George was got by this time to the arbour, where he &s;aw poor Cecilia wonderfully changed, and in an attitude of &s;orrow and repentance. She was now exceedingly un|happy. She had grieved the three be&s;t friends that &s;he had; her worthy parents, and her own dear George.</P>
<P>"My &s;weete&s;t Cecilia!" &s;aid George, and fell down on his knees before her. "Let us be friends: I would freely a&s;k forgivene&s;s for my fault, if I had really in|tended to di&s;plea&s;e you. Yet, if you will a&s;k my pardon, I will a&s;k yours al&s;o. Will you? Come, forgive, Cecilia; let us be friends again. Here, here are two nice peaches: I could not think of ta&s;ting them, as you were not to have your &s;hare."</P>
<P>"Ah! my deare&s;t George! (&s;aid Cecilia, &s;queezing his hand wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he &s;poke, and weeping on his &s;houlder,) what a good, &s;weet-tempered little fellow I have always found you! C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inly, (continued &s;he, and &s;obbed while &s;he &s;poke,) certainly a friend in one's misfortunes is a real friend indeed. But I will not take your peaches. It would have been pitiful behaviour in me, had I been vexed this morning for the lo&s;s of half a dozen apples. You do not think that I was, George, do you! No, it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the in&s;ulting look with which that pert Mi&s;s Lucinda viewed me; but I will not think about her now. Will you for|give me? added &s;he; and with her handkerchief wiped off the tears that &s;he had let fall on George's hand. I
<PB N="135" REF="147">know, I &s;ometimes love to plague you; but keep your peaches now, I will not eat them."</P>
<P>"Well, then, &s;i&s;ter, an&s;wered George, whenever the fancy comes into your head, e'en plague me ju&s;t as long as you think proper. Yet I will never let another do &s;o. You under&s;tand me? But as to the&s;e two peaches, I can|not eat them. I have told you &s;o already, and was never guilty of a &s;tory"</P>
<P>"No, nor I, (&s;aid Cecilia, and that moment flung them both away into the public road.) I cannot endure the thoughts of having made a quarrel up for intere&s;ted rea&s;ons.&mdash;But as we are now clo&s;e friends again, how happy would it make me, if I could but get mama's permi&s;&s;ion to appear, and a&s;k her pardon!"</P>
<P>"Oh! I will fly and get it for you, an&s;wered George; and hardly had pronounced the words, when he was got a good way from the arbour. I will inform mama, conti|nued he, that it was I who made you anger her, by having vexed you in the morning."</P>
<P>In effect, he &s;ucceeded &s;ooner than he expected.&mdash;In|deed, what errors would not any rea&s;onable woman over|look, in favour of a friend&s;hip &s;o affectionate and ge|nerous!</P>

<HEAD>CAESAR AND POMPEY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Saunders had brought up two hand&s;ome dogs, one Cae&s;ar and the other Pompey. He had named them &s;o, not with the wi&s;h or expectation that they &s;hould one day become rivals, like the two illu&s;trious commanders who&s;e names they bore, but though both were littered at a birth, had always fed together, and been treated with an ab&s;olute equality, yet it was not long before they ma|nife&s;ted very different tempers.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar was extremely meek and docile; Pompey rough and quarrel&s;ome.</P>
<P>The generous Cae&s;ar jumped for joy, when any one ca|re&s;&s;ed him, and never took it ill that his brother &s;hould
<PB N="140" REF="152">be fondled in the &s;ame manner; but the &s;urly Pompey, on the other hand, whenever Mr. Saunders had him in his lap, would growl if Cae&s;ar met with the lea&s;t notice, the lea&s;t &s;mile, or token of affection.</P>
<P>When the friends of Mr. Saunders, coming on a vi&s;it, brought their dogs, our Cae&s;ar would immediately get in among them, and endeavour to amu&s;e his company; and, as his nature was extremely pliant and in&s;inuating, and his manners very winning, they were always at their ea&s;e whenever it was his part to entertain them. They would play and fri&s;k about the apartments, ju&s;t as if they had been all at &s;chool with one another. The good Cae&s;ar did his utmo&s;t to &s;et off their beauty and activity, that Mr. Saunders might be plea&s;ed with their appearance, and induced to do them &s;ome good turn or other.</P>
<P>What did Pompey do in the mean time? He would get into a corner, and be all day barking at the &s;trangers. If unhappily they drew too near him, he would then be &s;ure to grin and &s;narl, and often bite their tails or ears. And if his ma&s;ter noticed any one among them for his breed|ing and good parts, he would howl with all his might, as if the hou&s;e was robbing.</P>
<P>Mr. Saunders had remarked this odious temper &s;ome time pa&s;t in Pompey, and begun already to neglect him. Cae&s;ar, on the other hand, gained &s;omething every day on his affection.</P>
<P>On a certain day, as he was &s;et at table, he re&s;olved to try their di&s;po&s;itions more than he ever yet had done. They were both attending at the table, Pompey being neare&s;t; for the hone&s;t Cae&s;ar, to avoid di&s;&s;en&s;ion, always gave him up with plea&s;ure the foremo&s;t place: and Mr. Saunders held out Pompey a nice piece of juicy meat, which he immediately fell a chewing. Cae&s;ar was not di&s;|contented in the lea&s;t at this, but waited with the greate&s;t good humour till his turn &s;hould come. His turn &s;oon came; but Mr. Saunders threw him nothing but a hard dry bone. He took it without any &s;ign of di&s;content; but hardly had the churli&s;h Pompey ob&s;erved Cae&s;ar bu&s;y with his &s;hare, though much inferior to his own, than he rejected with di&s;dain the bit between his teeth, and fell on Cae&s;ar to obtain his bone. The gentle Cae&s;ar made no manner of re&s;i&s;tance, but, imagining that it might plea&s;e the fickle ta&s;te of Pompey, yielded it at once.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="153">Do not think, my friends, that this conde&s;cen&s;ion on the part of Cae&s;ar was the effect of cowardice, or even weak|ne&s;s in him. He had given ample te&s;timony of his &s;trength and re&s;olution very lately, in a conte&s;t where he had been engaged on account of Pompey, who&s;e intolerable &s;urli|ne&s;s had drawn down upon him the re&s;entment of a dog that lived in the neighbourhood. He had not fought above five minutes, though it was he him&s;elf who had previou&s;ly provoked the fight, before he ran away; while Cae&s;ar, though without a friend to take his part, continued the engagement like a hero, and acquired at la&s;t &s;uch glory, as to make his adver&s;ary bite the du&s;t.</P>
<P>This anecdote his ma&s;ter knew; and as his character for courage was &s;o thoroughly confirmed, he made him take the bit of juicy meat that he had before thrown to Pompey, but which Pompey had rejected. "Cae&s;ar, my good fellow, &s;aid his ma&s;ter, it is but ju&s;t that you &s;hould enjoy your brother's portion, &s;ince he fir&s;t took yours; and therefore eat it."</P>
<P>Pompey &s;cowled at Cae&s;ar, &s;eeing the affection that ac|companied the&s;e words in Mr. Saunders's countenance; and Mr. Saunders added, "Since you have &s;hewn your|&s;elf thus complai&s;ant and generous towards him who treats you with &s;uch j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alou&s;y and envy, you &s;hall be in future my own dog, and range about the hou&s;e as you think proper; but your brother &s;hall be tied up in the yard: &s;o quick, a chain for Pompey! and let &s;ome one bid the car|penter this moment knock up a kennel for him." Ac|cordingly this la&s;t was in&s;tantly conducted to his &s;tation, while the other had his liberty to walk about the apart|ments.</P>
<P>Pompey would very probably have enjoyed with in&s;o|leace &s;o great a mark of favour, had <HI>he</HI> gained the advan|tage in his ma&s;ter's judgment; but the heart of Cae&s;ar bled at the idea of his brother's &s;entence, and he e&s;&s;ayed all means to &s;often his condition. When the &s;ervants gave him any thing, he would be &s;ure to carry it to Pompey, wag his tail with plea&s;ure, and invite him to regale upon it; and at night he would not fail to vi&s;it Pompey in his hou&s;e, amu&s;ing him in the mid&s;t of his &s;ufferings by all po&s;&s;ible means, and for hours together warming his be|numbed limbs.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="154">But Pompey, far from being &s;oftened by &s;uch kind actions, never welcomed Cae&s;ar to his kennel, nor receiv|ed him otherwi&s;e than with continual howlings; &s;o that very quickly after, rage inflamed his blood, his heart was ulcerated, and his entrails perfectly dried up.</P>
<P>You, children, who read this, if there be any one among you of a di&s;po&s;ition &s;uch as Pompey had, con&s;ider what a mi&s;erable lot awaits you, and reflect upon his puni&s;hment. You will otherwi&s;e lead a life of &s;orrow and humiliation, and expire in horror.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE GIRL WITH WHISKERS.</HEAD>
<P>"WON'T you do what I bid you then, Mr. Ob&s;ta|nacy? Come, &s;ir, obey; or el&s;e you will be the wor&s;e off for it, I can tell you." Thus Camilla, a pert little vixen of whom we are now going to give an ac|count, was perpetually rating and commanding her poor brother.</P>
<P>Might her word be taken for it, he did every thing ami&s;s: on the contrary, whatever &s;he thought of doing, was a ma&s;ter piece of rea&s;on and reflexion. The diver&s;ions that he propo&s;ed were always dull and heavy in her judg|ment; but forgetting this deci&s;ion, when the next day came, &s;he would mo&s;t probably chu&s;e them her&s;elf, as the livelie&s;t and mo&s;t entertaining. Her unhappy brother was obliged, on pain of being &s;oundly lectured, to obey her whims and fancies. If he dur&s;t attempt to &s;hew her the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of her procedure, &s;he would be that mo|ment in her airs; his play things then were &s;ure to go to ruin, and him&s;elf was forced to mope, without amu&s;ement, in a corner of the room.</P>
<P>Camilla's parents had a hundred times endeavoared to break her of this fault. Her mother in particular, was always telling her that people never gained the love of others, if they were not complai&s;ant and gentle; that a little girl, who would on all occa&s;ions &s;et up her own will by way of law for others, would be found the mo&s;t intole|rable creature in the univer&s;e. The&s;e prudent le&s;&s;ons, or in&s;tructions, made no manner of impre&s;&s;ion on her heart. Her brother, &s;ick of &s;o much tyranny, began already to
<PB N="143" REF="155">lo&s;e &s;omething of his love and kindne&s;s for her; and Camilla was &s;o far from &s;haking off her domineering di&s;po|&s;ition on that account, that &s;he became a hundred times more arbitrary and in&s;ulting.</P>
<P>As it chanced, a gentleman of under&s;tanding, and who was always remarkably &s;incere and open in his &s;peech and conduct, dined one day, upon an invitation, with Ca|milla's parents. He ob&s;erved with what a haughty air &s;he treated her poor little brother, nay, and every body in the room. At fir&s;t through mere politene&s;s, he kept &s;ilence; but, tired out ere long with her impertinence, he began, addre&s;&s;ing his di&s;cour&s;e to Mrs. Fleming, her mama, as follows: "Had I &s;uch a little girl as yours, I know what I would do."</P>
<P>What, &s;ir? &s;aid Mrs. Fleming.</P>
<P>You &s;hall hear, replied the gentleman. I am lately come from France, and, as I liked to &s;ee the &s;oldiers exerci&s;e, I amu&s;ed my&s;elf, by vi&s;iting the grand parade where the &s;oldiers are drawn up, as frequently as I had lei&s;ure. Among the &s;oldiers, there were many that I ob|&s;erved with whi&s;kers; and, one cannot but acknowledge, they looked very fierce, as &s;oldiers &s;hould. Now, had I a child like your Camilla, I would give her in&s;tantly a &s;ol|dier's uniform, and I would clap a pair of whi&s;kers on her, and make her a Swi&s;s Corporal, &s;o that &s;he might com|pletely &s;atisfy her pa&s;&s;ion for commanding.</P>
<P>Hearing this, Camilla &s;tood confounded. She could not refrain from blu&s;hing, and even wept.</P>
<P>From that time forward, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible how much a tyranizing di&s;po&s;ition mi&s;became her, and re&s;olved to &s;hun the mortifying con&s;equences which it would &s;oon or late bring down upon her. This re&s;olution, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prudent coun&s;els of her mother, quickly proved &s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>
<P>Such a change was doubtle&s;s very prudent on her part. It were however to be wi&s;hed, for all young ladies la|bouring under &s;uch a fault, that they would yield obe|dience to the kind in&s;truction of their parents on this &s;ub|ject; and not wait till &s;uch time as a man of under&s;tanding tells them, to their face, that they would look better in a &s;urly &s;oldier's uniform, with whi&s;kers, than &s;et off with nice white cambrick frocks, like all good-natured little ladies.</P>

<HEAD>THE SCAR.</HEAD>
<P>FERDINAND, from nature, had received a &s;oul endued with elevated thoughts and generous notions. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a lively turn of mind, a &s;trong and quick imagination, with a chearful temper. His whole per&s;on in a word, and his polite behaviour, won him every heart.</P>
<P>However, with &s;o many amiable qualities, he had a certain great defect, extremely inconvenient to his friends, of giving way to every &s;light impre&s;&s;ion, and yielding up his &s;oul to the emotions which any accidental circum&s;tance might rai&s;e within him.</P>
<P>When he &s;ought amu&s;ement in the circle of his play|mates, trifling contradictions ruffled his impatient di&s;po&s;i|tion, and they &s;aw the fire of rage in a moment inflame his whole countenance; he &s;tamped upon the ground, cried out, and was be&s;ide him&s;elf with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Once upon a time, as he was walking in his chamber to and fro, and meditating on the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for a treat which his father had permitted him to give his &s;i&s;ter, Marcian, his dear friend and favourite, intended to communicate his notions on the &s;ubject. Buried as he was in thought, he &s;aw not Marcian. Marcian, therefore, having called out to him, but in vain, drew nearer, and began to pull him by the &s;leeve; but Ferdinand, di&s;turbed and out of patience with the&s;e interruptions, unexpectedly turned round, with &s;o much rudene&s;s, that he &s;ent poor Marcian quite acro&s;s the apartment to fall down be&s;ide the wain&s;cot.</P>
<P>Marcian, after he dropped, lay &s;till without the lea&s;t appearance of life. To which I am to add, that, in fall|ing, he had &s;iruck his head again&s;t the moulding of a book-ca&s;e, and received a wound, as Ferdinand then fancied, in the temple, whence there came a deal of blood.</P>
<P>Heavens! reader, what a &s;hocking pro&s;pect was this for Ferdinand! who never had intended any harm to Marcian; and for whom he would have even lo&s;t his life, if there had been occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ferdinand fell down be&s;ide him, lamentably crying out, He is dead, he is dead! I have killed my friend! In&s;tead
<PB N="145" REF="157">of trying any means for his recovery, he remained &s;tretch|ed all along, uttering di&s;mal groans. Happily, his father heard him; he came running up, took Marcian in his arms, and having laid him on a bed, called out for &s;alts, and threw cold water in his face, which recovered him a little.</P>
<P>The return of Marcian to new life, tran&s;ported Ferdi|nand with joy; but, as he might relap&s;e, it was not great enough to take away entirely his anxiety.</P>
<P>A &s;urgeon, being &s;ent for, probed the wound. He found it to be not in the temple, but &s;o very near it, that the difference of a hair's breadth in its po&s;ition would have made it dangerous indeed, if not quite mortal. Being carried home, he &s;oon became delirious.</P>
<P>Ferdinand could by no means be per&s;uaded to leave Marcian. He took up his &s;tation by his dear friend's pillow, and maintained the profounde&s;t &s;ilence; Marcian frequent|ly pronounced the name of Ferdinand, while his delirium la&s;ted. My dear Ferdinand, he would &s;ay, in what had I offended you, that I &s;hould be treated thus? Yet, it is quite impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be le&s;s afflicted than my|&s;elf, for having wounded me, without the lea&s;t degree of provocation. Let it not, however, grieve your generous nature. I forgive you, and do you forgive me likewi&s;e, Ferdinand, for having put you, as I mu&s;t have done, into a pa&s;&s;ion. It was not my wi&s;h to vex you.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e which Marcian thus addre&s;&s;ed to Ferdi|nand, without ob&s;erving him, though pre&s;ent, and even holding him continually by the hand, redoubled his afflic|tion. Every word proceeding from the lips of Marcian, as it &s;erved but to proclaim the greatne&s;s of his friend&s;hip, was a poignard to the heart of Ferdinand.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, however, it plea&s;ed God, for Ferdinand's great con&s;olation, to a&s;&s;uage the violence of the fever. In ten days time the patient was enabled to get up.</P>
<P>What tongue can repre&s;ent the joy of Ferdinand! It is not to be comprehended certainly by any one, unle&s;s he him&s;elf has felt beforehand, the &s;orrow which Ferdinand experienced all the while that he was a witne&s;s of his friend's di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Marcian being at la&s;t thoroughly recovered, Ferdinand re&s;umed his former chearful humour, and not needing any other le&s;&s;on than the &s;orrowful event that had &s;o late y
<PB N="146" REF="158">happened, he laboured hard to overcome the vehemence of temper to which he had been a &s;lave.</P>
<P>Marcian in a very little time had no mark of the acci|dent remaining, but a trifling &s;car, as ju&s;t now mention|ed, near the temple. Ferdinand could never &s;ee this &s;car without emotion, even when they were both come to years of manhood. It became, in &s;hort, the &s;eal of that much clo&s;er friend&s;hip in which they were ever afterwards mutu|ally united.</P>

<HEAD>THE SILK SLIP.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Matilda had worn nothing but a plain white frock, till &s;he was eight years old. Neat red Morocco &s;hoes, with &s;ilver buckles, &s;et off her &s;mall feet; her ebon hair, which had never yet felt the torturing iron, floated in large curls upon her &s;houlders.</P>
<P>She had been one day in the company of certain little girls, who, though not older than her&s;elf, were dre&s;&s;ed already like great ladies; and the richne&s;s of their cloaths awakened in her heart the fir&s;t vain notions that &s;he had ever had within it.</P>
<P>Dear mama, &s;aid &s;he, returning from the hou&s;e where &s;he had met with the&s;e fine ladies, I have &s;een this after|noon the three Mi&s;s Flowerdales. I &s;uppo&s;e, you know them. The elde&s;t of them mu&s;t be younger than my&s;elf. O dear mama, how &s;weetly they were dre&s;&s;ed! Their pa|rents, &s;ure, mu&s;t have a deal of plea&s;ure, &s;eeing them &s;o fine! I dare &s;ay, they are not &s;o rich as you; &s;o give me, if you plea&s;e, a fine &s;ilk &s;lip, with &s;uch embroidered &s;hoes as they had on; and let my hair be dre&s;&s;ed by Mr. Frizzle, who, they tell me, is extremely clever.</P>

<P>I de&s;ire no better, if to do &s;o will contri|bute to your &s;atisfaction; but I fear, with all this elegance, you will find your&s;elf not quite &s;o happy as you have been hitherto, in the &s;implicity of &s;uch plain things as you ge|nerally wore.</P>

<P>Will you? Well then, I mu&s;t give you &s;uch a dre&s;s; but &s;till, remember that I have hinted what unea&s;ine&s;s your vanity may cau&s;e you.</P>
</SP>
<P>Unper&s;uaded by the wi&s;dom of this coun&s;el, Matilda did not lo&s;e a moment in de&s;troying all the plea&s;ure and enjoyment of her infancy. Her hair, which had till then hung down at liberty, was now to be confined in paper, and &s;queezed clo&s;e between a burning hot pair of tongs; and that fine jet, which had till now &s;o happily &s;et off the whitene&s;s of her forehead, was to di&s;appear beneath a clot of powder and pomatum.</P>
<P>Two days after, Matilda had a hand&s;ome &s;lip brought home, of pea-green taffety with fine pink trimmings, and a pair of &s;traw-worked &s;hoes to match them. The ta&s;te that appeared in her cloaths, their vivid colour and elegance of make&mdash;charmed the eye; but when &s;he had them on, it was evident that her limbs were under great con&s;traint; her motions had no longer their accu&s;tomed ea&s;e and free|dom; and her infant countenance, amid&s;t &s;o va&s;t a quanti|ty of flowers, &s;ilk, gauze, and ribbands, lo&s;t entirely every trace of ingenuous &s;implicity.</P>
<P>She was, notwith&s;tanding, quite enchanted at her me|tamorpho&s;is. Her eyes, with mighty &s;atisfaction, wan|dered over her whole little per&s;on, and were never taken off, except when &s;he looked round about her, to find out &s;ome gla&s;s in the apartment that might repre&s;ent before her, at full length, the idol which &s;he then wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>She had wrought on her mama to &s;end out cards of invitation to her little friends, that when they came to vi&s;it her &s;he might enjoy a fea&s;t, in viewing their &s;urpri&s;e and admiration. When they had all met together, &s;he walked to and fro before them, like a peacock; and from her behaviour, any one would have imagined that &s;he
<PB N="148" REF="160">&s;uppo&s;ed her&s;elf an empre&s;s, and con&s;idered tho&s;e about her as &s;ubjected to her empire. But, alas! this triumph was but of a very &s;hort duration, and a multitude of mor|tifying circum&s;tances followed it.</P>
<P>The children were permitted to go out a walking in the fields, near that part of the town where &s;he lived. Ma|tilda therefore led the way, and they reached, in ten or fifteen minutes, a delightful country.</P>
<P>A luxuriant meadow fir&s;t of all attracted their attention. It was every where enamelled with a va&s;t variety of charm|ing flowers, and butterflies who&s;e wings were of a thou|&s;and mingled colours, hovered in each quarter of it. The gay little ladies hunted the&s;e fine butterflies; they dex|trou&s;ly caught, but did not hurt them; and when once they had examined all their beauty, let them go, and with their eyes pur&s;ued the little creatures as they flut|tered to and fro. They employed them&s;elves in making no&s;egays likewi&s;e of the flowers that &s;prung up in the meadow, which they gathered for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Matilda, who from pride had fir&s;t of all di&s;dained the&s;e mean amu&s;ements, wanted very &s;oon to &s;hare the enter|tainment that they afforded; but the ground, they told her, might be damp, in which ca&s;e &s;he would &s;tain her &s;hoes, and damage her fine &s;lip; for they had now di&s;co|vered that her intention, in thus bringing them together, was to vex them only with a &s;ight of her fine clothes, and they re&s;olved to mortify her in their turn.</P>
<P>She was of cour&s;e obliged to be &s;olitary, and &s;it &s;till; while &s;he ob&s;erved the &s;prightly chearfulne&s;s of her com|panions who &s;ported round about her. The delight of contemplating on her pea-green &s;lip was, compared there|to, a very &s;orry kind of entertainment.</P>
<P>At the corner of the meadow there was a &s;ort of little grove, in which was to be heard the mu&s;ic of a thou&s;and birds, that &s;eemed as if inviting every per&s;on who went through the meadow, to go thither, and enjoy the cool|ne&s;s of the &s;hade. This grove our children entered, jump|ing as they went along with joy. Poor Matilda would have followed them, but &s;he was told that the bu&s;hes would tear all her finery to pieces. She ob&s;erved her friends to divert them&s;elves at <HI>pu&s;&s;ey in the corner,</HI> and pur&s;ue each other through the trees. The more &s;he heard
<PB N="149" REF="161">them &s;hout with joy, the more, as any one might have expected, &s;he was peevi&s;h and ill-humoured.</P>
<P>But the younge&s;t of her vi&s;itors had &s;ome &s;ort of com|pa&s;&s;ion on her. She had ju&s;t found out a corner where there grew a quantity of fine wild &s;trawberries, and there|fore beckoned to her to come and eat part of them. She would willingly have done &s;o, but had &s;carcely got into the grove, when unexpectedly a loud cry was heard. The children gathered to the &s;pot, and found poor Matilda fa&s;tened by the gauze upon her hat and ribbands, to a branch of white thorn from which &s;he could not by any means di&s;engage her&s;elf. They made ha&s;te to loo&s;e the pins that held her hat on; but to add to her affliction, as her hair, which had been frizzed with &s;o much labour, was likewi&s;e entangled with the branch of white thorn, it co&s;t her almo&s;t a whole lock before &s;he could be &s;et at liberty; and thus all at once the charming &s;uper&s;tructure of her head-dre&s;s was ab&s;olutely pulled to pieces.</P>
<P>'Tis not difficult to gue&s;s how little this misfortune thus befalling Matilda touched her play-mates, when they found, as we have &s;aid already, why &s;he had invited them. In&s;tead of con&s;olation, which &s;he needed, and perhaps expected, they could hardly keep from laughing at her comical appearance, and did actually jeer her with a hundred wicked wittici&s;ms. After having &s;moothed her down a little, they ran off in &s;earch of fre&s;h amu&s;ement, towards a hill that they &s;aw at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>Matilda however could not, without very great diffi|culty, reach this hill. Her &s;trait &s;hoes, which had been made &s;o to &s;et off her little feet the better, were a great ob&s;truction to her &s;peed; nor was this all the mi&s;chief, for her &s;tays were drawn &s;o clo&s;e that &s;he could not ea&s;ily fetch breath. She would have now been happy to go home and change her dre&s;s, in order to be at ea&s;e; but then &s;he knew that her little friends would never have con&s;ented, upon her account, to be deprived of their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>They had got by this time to the &s;ummit of the hill, and were enjoying the fine view which a &s;pacious horizon pre&s;ented them on every &s;ide. They &s;aw on one hand verdant meadows; on the other, yellow harve&s;ts; before
<PB N="150" REF="162">them rivulets meandering through the country; and by way of termination to the land&s;cape, a large river, on who&s;e banks were many plea&s;ant country hou&s;es. So magnificent a pro&s;pect charmed them. They even danced about with joy, while Matilda at the bottom of the hill, (for &s;he was ab&s;olutely out of breath, and could not po&s;|&s;ibly get further,) was devoured with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>She had time and opportunity enough, in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, to make many &s;ad reflexions. To what purpo&s;e, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, are the&s;e fine clothes! how much plea|&s;ure do they not prevent me from enjoying! and what pain do I not &s;uffer, merely from having put them on!</P>
<P>She was giving up her mind to the&s;e afflicting thoughts, when &s;uddenly &s;he heard her friends come running down the hill, and all cry out together, as they pa&s;&s;ed her, Run, run, Matilda, there is a dreadful &s;torm behind the hill; it is coming towards us! if you do not make ha&s;te, your &s;lip will &s;oon be wet quite through!</P>
<P>Matilda felt her &s;trength returning, at the fear of &s;uch a great misfortune as her play-mates threatened. She for|got her wearine&s;s, her pinched feet, and her tight lacing, and made tolerable ha&s;te to reach &s;ome place of &s;helter. But in &s;pite of all her efforts to &s;hun &s;o grievous a misfor|tune as the &s;poiling of her clothes, &s;he could not run &s;o fa&s;t as her companions, who were lightly dre&s;&s;ed. Then, too, every moment &s;he was &s;topped, at one time, by her hoop and flounces in the narrow paths by which &s;he was obliged to go; at another, by her train which was fre|quently caught fa&s;t by the furze; and at others by the fine &s;eaffold work about her head, on which the wind bent down the branches of tho&s;e trees, under which &s;he was forced to pa&s;s in her way homeward.</P>
<P>At that moment too the &s;torm bur&s;t forth in all its fury; and there fell a &s;hower of hail and rain mixed together, after all but Matilda had regained their &s;everal habitations.</P>
<P>In the end, however, Matilda got home likewi&s;e, but wet through and through. She had be&s;ides left one of her fine &s;hoes behind her in a heap of dung, which as &s;he hurried homeward, &s;he had &s;crambled over without &s;eeing it; and to increa&s;e the li&s;t of her di&s;a&s;ters, &s;he had not
<PB N="151" REF="163">quite cleared the meadow, when a gu&s;t of wind blew off her hat into the middle of a dirty pool of water.</P>
<P>They had all the trouble that one can po&s;&s;ibly imagine to undre&s;s her; &s;o much had the &s;weat and rain even glued her &s;hift and other garments to her body; &s;o that her whole dre&s;s was &s;poiled, and ab&s;olutely good for nothing.</P>
<P>Shall I have another &s;lip, my dear, made up for you again&s;t to-morrow? &s;aid her mother drily, &s;eeing her in tears.</P>
<P>O no, mama, &s;aid Matilda, ki&s;&s;ng her: I am con|vinced, fine clothes can never make the wearer of them happy. Let me take up with my nice white frock again; and have no more pomatum in my hair, till I am eight or ten years older than at pre&s;ent; and forgive my folly.</P>
<P>Matilda, with the dre&s;s of childhood, came again into the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her liberty, and &s;eemed as mode&s;t and as charming as &s;he had ever been. Neither did her dear mama regret the lo&s;s that &s;he had experienced in the pur|cha&s;e of this fine &s;ilk &s;lip, &amp;c. &s;ince it proved the means of rein&s;tating her beloved daughter in the happine&s;s which her vanity and folly would have taken from her, had it not been for this u&s;eful le&s;&s;on.</P>

<P>I left them in the flames; but it was again&s;t my will. I did not like to part with them, but my papa would have it &s;o: he threatened me, and in an angry tone bid Gilbert pay no heed to my re&s;i&s;tance. I was forced at la&s;t to yield, for fear of putting him into a greater pa&s;&s;ion. I cannot hold out any longer, but, whatever be the danger, I mu&s;t go back to find if they are in &s;afety.</P>

<P>And yet I have half a mind to do &s;o. What a charming bonfire it mu&s;t make! I do not &s;ee clearly, but I think that &s;teeple is down, that had the golden dragon on the top.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh! it is not for you. I am come to get a gla&s;s of water for poor Adrian. He will have neither milk, nor ale, nor wine. "My dear papa, (&s;ays he,) mama, and &s;i&s;ter, very likely, are at pre&s;ent dry and hangry, and &s;hall I have &s;uch nice things?

<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>One mu&s;t own, however, it is &s;omething comical, that Adrian &s;hould refu&s;e a drop of any thing that is good, becau&s;e he cannot get tidings of his parents.</P>

<P>Oh! I know you well enough! Your &s;i&s;ter might be burnt alive, and you not eat a mouthful le&s;s on that

<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I&mdash;provided I were not hungry.</P>
</SP>

<P>Can one then be hungry in &s;uch a ca&s;e? Look ye, Lubbin, I have not the lea&s;t degree of appetite. To &s;ee poor Adrian weep, and take on &s;o, has made me quite forget my hunger.</P>

<HEAD>THE GREAT GARDEN.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sage had received no very great inheritance from fortune and his parents, but was not without the happy &s;ecret of limiting his de&s;ires to what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and notwith&s;tanding he was frequently obliged to go without a number of conveniencies and comforts which others could command by means of their abundance, never did one envious thought di&s;turb his equability of temper. He had never &s;uffered more than one affliction of con&s;i|derable magnitude, ari&s;ing from his want of this life's comforts; and that was the lo&s;s of an affectionate and virtuous woman, torn from his embraces by the hand of death. A charming little fellow, Polydore Sage, was the only child remaining to con&s;ole him; and the educa|tion of this charming little fellow, was the &s;ingle object of his &s;tudy and attention.</P>
<P>Polydore was endued by nature with very &s;trong imagi|nation; and by this, his father had found out the happy &s;ecret of improving his rea&s;on, at a very early time of life; namely, by exhibiting before him every object in its real point of view, of which he had beforehand only given him an idea. By a &s;eries of &s;trong images, arranged in order, and &s;elected in a proper moment to produce their full effect, he had enabled him already to make many ac|curate and deep reflexions.</P>
<P>Satisfied with his condition, this good father wi&s;hed particularly to inculcate in his &s;on tho&s;e principles to which he owed him&s;elf the calm of his condition, and the peace within his mind. Yes, often would he whi&s;per to him&s;elf, if I can but accu&s;tom him to live contented with his humble fortune, and point out to him the folly of putting any value upon what he mu&s;t not hope to obtain, I &s;hall contribute more to make his manhood happy, than by leaving him a heap of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Occupied ince&s;&s;antly on this important le&s;&s;on, he thought fit one evening to accompany his &s;on to Vauxhall Gardens, for the fir&s;t time in his life. Immediately on entering, Polydore was &s;truck with admiration and de|light. The perfume of the flowers, the beauty of the paintings, the well-ordered di&s;po&s;ition of the walks, the
<PB N="168" REF="180">crowd of men and women who were in them, elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, the ince&s;&s;ant motion of the multitude, the hum of their di&s;cour&s;e, the noi&s;e of the ca&s;cade, all joined to attract his contemplation; and his eye con&s;idered at one view ten thou&s;and objects. His good father &s;eeing him, if we may &s;ay &s;o, &s;wallowed up in thought, conducted him to that part of the gardens which was more retired from public ob&s;ervation; that his &s;en&s;es, which were too much occupied by &s;uch a crowd of images, might be in &s;ome degree at re&s;t. Soon after, he propo&s;ed indulging him with &s;ome refre&s;hment, if he liked it.&mdash;Polydore gladly took his father's offer; and &s;oon after, having &s;atis|fied his appetite and palate, &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>How extremely happy every one here pre&s;ent &s;eems to be! I &s;hould like, papa, if we had &s;uch a charming gar|den. Did you notice what a number of fine carriages were at the door? And all tho&s;e gentlefolks that pa&s;s us, how well dre&s;&s;ed they are! I &s;hould be glad to know why we mu&s;t live &s;o &s;avingly, when others in the world indulge them&s;elves with every thing that they fancy. I begin, papa, believe me, now to &s;ee how poor you are. But why, then, are &s;o many around us rich? They are not better people &s;ure than you, papa.</P>
<P>You &s;peak exactly like a child, replied the father. <HI>You begin to &s;ee how poor I am?</HI> Now I can tell you, I am quite rich.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where, then, are your riches?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a garden bigger by far than this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>A garden? You, papa! I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we go into the country, you &s;hall &s;ee it.</P>
<P>They went very &s;oon, it being now the &s;ea&s;on for taking the plea&s;ures of the country, and on the very day of their arrival at the country-hou&s;e, not far from London, Mr. Sage took his &s;on and led him up a hill, from whence the eye commanded an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. On the right, was &s;een a &s;pacious fore&s;t, who&s;e extremities &s;eemed lo&s;t at the horizon. On the left, appeared a beauteous mixture of fine gardens, verdant meadows, and va&s;t fields quite covered with the promi&s;e of a plenteous harve&s;t. Clo&s;e below the hill was &s;tretched a valley, watered in its whole extent with a thou&s;and little rills;
<PB N="169" REF="181">and all this land&s;cape was in motion. There were fi&s;her|men in one part, bu&s;y with their nets; and hu&s;bandmen, who in another were employed in gathering fruits and herbs, and &s;port&s;men with their greyhounds urging the &s;wift &s;tag, and &s;hepherds watching by their flocks, or playing near them in the &s;hade; and reapers carting their la&s;t &s;heaves, and dancing all the way before them as they proceeded homeward. This delightful picture captivated Mr. Sage and his &s;on, who for a time kept &s;ilence, till the child began the following conver&s;ation:</P>
<P>Papa, when &s;hall we reach your garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are at it now, my child.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look round as far as you can &s;ee; for this, I tell you, is my garden. Yonder fore&s;t, and the&s;e fields are all my property.</P>

<P>Your property, papa? You are joking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, I am not. I will convince you in an in&s;tant that I di&s;po&s;e of every thing all around us as the owner of it only can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will delight me to be &s;ure of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had all this country, what would you do with it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the owners of e&s;tates generally do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>What may that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, I would cut down a deal of timber, and make fire-wood of it, to be u&s;ed this winter. In the next place, I would go a hunting to catch veni&s;on; and &s;ometimes I would fi&s;h. I would breed &s;heep, and oxen; and in harve&s;t, gather in the corn that covers this fine country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you comprehend the matter admi|rably, Polydore: and I am glad to find our notions are &s;o like each other's. Well, whatever you would do, then, I already do; and I will convince you of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay, then, in the fir&s;t place, I have men who cut down for me in this fore&s;t all the wood that I want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I never heard you order them to cut down any for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? becau&s;e they have the fore|thought to prevent me. We have always a good fire
<PB N="170" REF="182">below, and &s;ometimes, too, up &s;tairs. Well then, I have the wood brought to me from the fore&s;t to keep up tho&s;e fires: for here, you know, we cannot get coals to burn as if we were in London.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, papa. It would be cut down for you, and &s;ent in without a penny co&s;t on your part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You believe &s;o, do you? On the contrary, I think the co&s;t might be a great deal more in that ca&s;e than at pre&s;ent; for you will grant, if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fore&s;t, I mu&s;t keep at lea&s;t a woodman to cut down the trees for fire-wood.</P>

<P>We &s;hould have a charming appetite to do &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, as I cannot go a hunting, I &s;end hunt&s;men in my place; and very probably, the veni&s;on that you have &s;een hang up at Charing-cro&s;s, where, as you remember, you went with me lately to buy &s;ome, was hunted in this fore&s;t. I can therefore, without hunting veni&s;on, have as much as I think proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>For your money!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and is it not a charming thing for me that I can come at veni&s;on on the&s;e terms? for I have no wages to pay to tho&s;e who hunt it for me; or provided they &s;hould &s;hoot it, I have neither to &s;upply them with gun, nor ball nor powder. Tho&s;e various kinds of dogs that our &s;quire maintains, thank Heaven! they eat up nothing that belongs to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are tho&s;e cows too, and &s;heep that graze in yonder meadow, yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly. Have not you fre&s;h butter every day? I get it from tho&s;e cows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa, if all the&s;e flocks, and all tho&s;e little rivers too, are yours, why have not we at dinner
<PB N="171" REF="183">every day all &s;orts of meat and fi&s;h, as other rich folks I am told have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do they eat up every thing that their &s;ervants &s;et before them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but they may chu&s;e at table whatever they like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as for me, I make my choice before my victuals come to table. Every thing that I want, I have. Superfluous things, it is true, I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s; but what benefit would they procure me if I had them? I &s;hould want, in that ca&s;e, a &s;uperfluous &s;tomach al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wealthy people make good cheer; but you, papa, I fancy, do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do, and better than the wealthy, Polydore. I have a &s;auce that almo&s;t always fails them; namely, a good appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you then a deal of money, as they have, to &s;atisfy a thou&s;and wi&s;hes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much more money; or at lea&s;t, what is better, I have no wi&s;hes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, however, there is a deal of plea&s;ure in contenting them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hundred times more plea&s;ure, child, in being content of one's &s;elf, as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not God, pray, love the rich a great deal more than you, &s;ince he be&s;tows upon them &s;o much gold and &s;ilver?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Polydore, do not you recollect the wine that we had la&s;t Wedne&s;day on the table, when your uncle came to dine and &s;up with us, and which you &s;aid was &s;o delicious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa; I remember you were &s;o good as to give me half a gla&s;s full of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you wanted more. I might have let you have it, &s;ince, you know, the bottle had a deal left in it, even after &s;upper: why, then, did I not oblige you, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e you were afraid that it would make me ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I recollect I told you &s;o: and do not you think that I did right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! as for that, you did indeed; I know you love me, and are always &s;tudying how to make me happy.
<PB N="172" REF="184">So you would not have refu&s;ed me &s;uch a trifle as a gla&s;s of wine, if you had thought that it would have plea&s;ed me, and not hurt my health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you think that God loves you le&s;s than I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, I cannot, after what I have heard you &s;ay &s;o often of his goodne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and &s;ilver in abundance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more difficult than I &s;hould find it to give any one a handful of the du&s;t that we tread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>On the other hand, do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and &s;ilver in abundance?</P>

<P>No more difficult than I &s;hould find it to give any one a handful of the du&s;t that we tread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if, as you acknowledge, he is able to be&s;tow the&s;e on you, and does not be&s;tow them, even though he loves you, what are you to think of his refu&s;al?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the riches which I de&s;ire from him would be hurtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you perfectly convinced of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, perfectly, and have not a word to &s;ay again&s;t. Yet, papa&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; why thus &s;hake your head? You have &s;till &s;ome burthen on your heart: what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwit&s;tanding all your rea&s;onings, I can never bring my&s;elf to fancy all this country yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e you cannot enjoy it as you plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know the famous Mr. Norton?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I know him? Why that is he who has &s;uch charming gardens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can he enjoy tho&s;e gardens as he plea&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed; poor man! he dares not even eat a bunch of grapes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have &s;een &s;ome very fine ones in his garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; but they would do him harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ee then, one may ea&s;ily po&s;&s;e&s;s a num|ber of good things, and yet not dare to u&s;e them as one likes. I dare not u&s;e my gardens as I certainly &s;hould like, becau&s;e my fortune will not let me: and this Mr. Norton dares not u&s;e his garden as he likes, becau&s;e his
<PB N="173" REF="185">health will not allow him. So that I am much the happie&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, you love to ride a hor&s;e-back&mdash; do not you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for it is an exerci&s;e that does me good, when I have time to take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if the&s;e meadows are all yours, why do not you take the hay that grows upon them, and in future keep a hor&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is the very thing which I do. And tho&s;e &s;ame hay-cocks that you &s;ee there, are po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bly in|tended for the hor&s;e that I ride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I never &s;aw one in your &s;table?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven be prai&s;ed, I am not at &s;uch a great expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do you ride as frequently as you would like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are wrong: for I am &s;o prudent, that I never wi&s;h to ride but when a ride would do me good, and then I get it for about three &s;hillings. God be prai&s;ed! I am rich enough to pay that &s;um.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not you imagine that to have two fine pie|bald hor&s;es, and to be drawn about the country in a fa&s;hionable coach, would be very plea&s;ant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreeable enough: but when I think of all the inconvenience that attends a coach; how often one would want the harne&s;s-maker, &s;mith and wheelwright; how much one depends upon the health of hor&s;es, and the conduct of a coachman; and what ri&s;que one runs of being over&s;et, together with the fatal con&s;equences which luxury too frequently occa&s;ions,&mdash;truly, Polydore, I do not grieve that I am obliged to u&s;ed my legs, which cer|tainly will la&s;t me long enough. But &s;ee, the &s;un is now &s;et, and we mu&s;t think of getting home before the evening clo&s;es on us. Let me have your hand &mdash;Now, are you not quite plea&s;ed in having &s;een my great e&s;tate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear papa, I &s;hould be much more &s;o, could I but be per&s;uaded that it were yours.</P>
<P>The father &s;miled at this reply; and down the hill they walked together. As it happened, they went by a mea|dow, which at fir&s;t they thought had been a pond, becau&s;e it was quite covered with water. Ble&s;s me! cried out Mr. Sage, do you &s;ee this meadow, how it is overflowed?
<PB N="174" REF="186">The neighbouring river mu&s;t have bur&s;t its bounds, and all the hay this year is &s;poiled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy he to whom the hay belonged will not be very happy, when they tell him of his lo&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; nor yet is this the wor&s;t: he will be forced to mend the banks, and very likely make ano|ther dam Why, he will be very happy, if he does not &s;pend in the&s;e repairs the produce of ten harve&s;ts that he could make in &s;uch a meadow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! What a misfortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I thought there had been a windmill hereabouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there is, papa. Look there before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, I &s;ee it now: the rea&s;on is, I did not hear it going. I would lay any wager that the torrent coming down has forced away the wheelwork. Let us go &s;ee.&mdash;Ju&s;t &s;o.&mdash;It is broke to pieces.&mdash;What will the poor owner do? He mu&s;t be very rich indeed, to &s;tand again&s;t &s;o many l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>On! I pity him with all my heart! But &s;ince the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y is over, pray why are the bricklayers &s;till at work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell why. We need but a&s;k the rea&s;on. Pray friend, be &s;o kind as to inform us why you work &s;o late?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A Bricklayer.</SPEAKER>
<P>We &s;hall be here all night; for ye&s;terday, when it was dark, a gang of thieves pulled down the wall, that they might get into the park, and &s;teal away the fur|niture that had been put into a new built &s;ummer-hou&s;e. The theft was not di&s;covered till this morning; and in|deed it is very lucky that no one caught them in the fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Bricklayer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e the thieves had previou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed combu&s;tibles to &s;et the &s;ummer-hou&s;e on fire, if they had been di&s;turbed in plundering; &s;o that they might get away a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion which &s;uch de&s;truction would have cau&s;ed. The owner of this ground, as you may judge, is therefore very happy in his lo&s;s: he might have &s;een his &s;ummer-hou&s;e burnt down; whereas, the affair will co&s;t him now no more than &s;ome &s;light re|pairs to his wall, the expence of keeping up a watch all night, and buying other furniture in&s;tead of the former, which indeed had co&s;t him a good deal.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="187">Well, Polydore, now &s;aid Mr. Sage to his &s;on, when they had walked a little way in &s;ilence, what do you ob|&s;erve on the&s;e misfortunes? Do not they grieve you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;hould I be &s;orry? I have &s;uffered no|thing by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if this e&s;tate had been your property, as Mr. Norton's grounds are his; and if, when going out this morning, you had &s;een your meadow overflowed, your wind-mill broken to pieces, your park wall demoli&s;hed, and your &s;ummer-hou&s;e robbed, would you have gone home as &s;atisfied as you appear to be at pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh by no means. I &s;hould, on the contrary, be mi&s;erable, had I undergone &s;o many heavy lo&s;&s;es in a day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if you had every day &s;uch lo&s;&s;es to endure, or to dread? would you be as happy as at pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be a thou&s;and times more mi&s;erable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Polydore, &s;uch is in reality the &s;tate of all who po&s;&s;e&s;s great abundance. Without reckon|ing up the cares that agitate them, and the innumerable wants which they fancy,&mdash;in the elevation of their for|tune lies too frequently the cau&s;e of its decay. A bar|ren &s;ea&s;on, or a fal&s;e &s;tep in the pur&s;uit of their rapacious projects, frequently &s;uffices to produce their ruin. As they fear the lo&s;s of their imaginary con&s;equence, &s;hould they re&s;olve upon &s;ome &s;acrifices to their luxury and pride; the more they undergo di&s;tre&s;&s;ing lo&s;&s;es, the more they &s;uppo&s;e that they ought to make a &s;umptuous &s;how to keep up the appearance of their riches, and &s;upport a credit which already totters to its fall. What then is the effect of &s;uch a wretched &s;ort of vanity? Their &s;ervants, per|haps, kept out of their wages an un&s;ea&s;onable time, proceed to introduce a &s;ort of robbery through all the hou&s;e. The improvement of their fortune, and the edu|cation of their children being overlooked, their lands in &s;ome &s;ort as it were lie fallow, or produce a blighted har|ve&s;t only; and their children, left to riot in the ways of wickedne&s;s, commit di&s;graceful actions which are &s;tified by the nece&s;&s;ary aid of money. All their property, when &s;eized by inexorable creditors, is in the end completely di&s;&s;ipated, or el&s;e the law lays hold of what would other|wi&s;e be left them. And the&s;e favourites of fortune, once
<PB N="176" REF="188">&s;o proud of their abundance, elevated &s;tation, and enjoy|ments, fall at once to the lowe&s;t pitch of indigence, &s;hame an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh what a frightful picture is this, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is one, however, daily to be &s;een in &s;ociety; and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ured, there is not one exaggerated feature in the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le portrait. I can at all times &s;hew you, in the public papers, the dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of &s;ome great family or other: and the&s;e &s;triking in&s;tances God's providence expo&s;es to the ob&s;ervation of the rich, that they may &s;ee what fortune is mo&s;t likely to await their pride and folly. In the mor|ning we will go and gaze on tho&s;e fine buildings which ex|cite your envy now, where you may read the ruin of too many families in&s;cribed on every pillar round about, till they are &s;wallowed up them&s;elves in their own ruin. Why, alas, can I not &s;pare your &s;en&s;ibility the cries of many de|&s;olated families, which are but too evincing tokens of &s;uch mi&s;erable revolutions!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, &s;hould I look upon the mediocrity of our condition as a ble&s;&s;ing meant us from above?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; if you are only frugal and in|du&s;trious, and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient re&s;olution to renounce am|bition and the immoderate wi&s;h of getting money, of confining your de&s;ires, and keeping them within the limits of that &s;tate you fill. Do I want any thing to make me happy? and in rea&s;on, would you wi&s;h hereafter to be happier than your father is? Con&s;ider the whole uni|ver&s;e as your e&s;tate; &s;ince if you are but properly indu&s;|trious, it will furni&s;h you a comfortable maintenance. God's providence has placed your earthly habitation half way up a hill, who&s;e &s;ummit is extremely craggy, and its ba&s;e choaked up with &s;wamps. Lift up your eye at intervals upon the rich and great, not with a view to envy them their &s;ituations, but to think upon the &s;torms that bellow round them. Sometimes too, look down upon the poor beneath you, not by way of in&s;ult on their friendle&s;s &s;ituation, but to hold them out your hand. If God &s;hould ble&s;s you with a family of children, let them often hear the le&s;&s;on which I have ju&s;t now taught you; but particularly, give them in your life and man|ners that example which God's ble&s;&s;ing has enabled me to afford you.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="189">By this time they were both at home. The virtuous Mr. Sage went up &s;tairs into his chamber, and there falling on his knees, gave thanks to God for all the ble&s;&s;ings which he had con&s;tantly received, and offered him the &s;acrifice of his exi&s;tence, as the be&s;t return that he could make. What need had he of being any longer upon earth? His days had been replete with probity and honour, and by giving &s;uch a le&s;&s;on on contentment to his &s;on, he endeavoured, as far as in him lay, to endow him with a valuable patrimony, &s;uch as no one could take from him.</P>

<P>Poor Danby! I am &s;orry for you. Roberts looks for all the world as if he loved &s;uch mi&s;chief. We &s;hall have his company this evening for the fir&s;t time in our lives: his father begged papa to let him come and &s;ee us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greater plea&s;ure! We &s;hould like to have him ten miles off. Since he has been our neighbour, we are continually unea&s;y. He has frequently amu&s;ed him&s;elf with breaking windows, and then tried to lay the blame on us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;o he means to do, and therefore ye&s;terday gave warning; and now we are forbidden all manner of connexion with this Roberts, he is &s;o wicked! Would you think it, very few go by the hou&s;e, without being apprehen&s;ive that he will put &s;ome trick upon them. Sometimes he diverts him&s;elf by &s;quirting puddle water at them, or el&s;e pelting them with rotten apples. Nay, he will &s;ometimes fa&s;ten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs, at which the people, when they &s;ee it, all bur&s;t out a laughing. Then too he has what he calls his <HI>caxen fi&s;hery.</HI></P>

<P>Caxen fi&s;hery!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes: he will take the people's wigs off, as they pa&s;s him, with a hook, as you would carp. When any poor man &s;tops before his window to conver&s;e with an acquaintance, Roberts immediately goes up to the bal|cony, with a &s;tring &s;u&s;pended from a fi&s;hing-rod, and at the end of it a hook, with which he jerks the poor man's wig off. Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpo&s;e, after which he drives the creature out into the &s;treet, and off he &s;ets that in&s;tant, &s;o that the poor perriwig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud, before its owner can lay hold of it again.</P>
