<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM an attentive ob&s;ervation on young people, particularly tho&s;e of my own family, I have long thought it of as great impor|tance to teach them le&s;&s;ons of com|pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>dumb creation,</HI> as a fellow feeling for their own &s;pecies: not only becau&s;e the one is con|nected with the other, but, becau&s;e
<PB N="VI" REF="6">
an early neglect of the duties of humanity, in regard to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> leads but too naturally to an omi&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e duties as to the <HI>la&s;t:</HI> and every one mu&s;t have noticed, in mo&s;t children, a tyrannical, &s;ome|times a cruel, propen&s;ity to torment animals within their power, &s;uch as &mdash;per&s;ecuting flies, torturing birds, cats, dogs, &amp;c. Some friends of mine joined me in thinking that a collection of humane facts, and arguments, in favour of the&s;e &s;uf|fering creatures, might be of con&s;i|derable u&s;e, if brought into view,
<PB N="VII" REF="7">
not only to our own offspring, but if made public, to youth in general. With this idea, it was my inten|tion to have made a &s;election from <HI>various</HI> authors: but a &s;ufficient number of Tales being found in the writings fir&s;t examined, I did not look further; unwilling to &s;well the compilation to a &s;ize that might fatigue, or appear formidable, to my little friends&mdash;Perhaps, indeed, &s;o great a number of &s;tories, for my purpo&s;e, could not have been met with in the works of any other author; and, I tru&s;t, the pre&s;ent

THE BROTHERS AND THE BLACKBIRD.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cold &s;ea&s;on, a poor Blackbird had taken &s;helter in Sir Armine's green-hou&s;e. Animated by the genial heat, it was ba&s;king upon an orange-tree, and, warmed out of the cold re|membrance of time and place, &s;tretched
<PB N="2" REF="10">
out its wings, in a kind of Summer lan|guor, over the branches, and had begun to pour a &s;emi-note of gratitude and joy. Henry, the younger Brother, ha&s;|tily, yet on tip-toe, ran round to &s;hut the window at which it had entered, fir&s;t clo&s;ing the doors&mdash;"I have wi&s;hed for a Blackbird, I know not how long," whi&s;pered he, "and it will be quite a charity to give that poor fellow good winter-quarters in the ca&s;tle&mdash;I own it is almo&s;t a pity to di&s;turb him now he &s;eems &s;o comfortable; but if he knew how very kindly I would u&s;e him, he would come a volunteer into my cham|ber." "Very kind to be &s;ure," &s;aid John, the elde&s;t, "to make him a &s;lave for life; to my thoughts he had better chu&s;e his own lodging, though the be&s;t to be had were in a barn, or in
<PB N="3" REF="11">
a hollow tree, and an independent warm here in the hot-hou&s;e, when he finds an opportunity, than be a pri&s;oner in the be&s;t room of the ca&s;tle, nay in the king's palace; &s;o be advi&s;ed, brother, and let him alone."&mdash;John &s;oftly opened part of the window neare&s;t the bird. "No, I'll tell you how it &s;hall be," ob&s;erved little James, "give the bird fair play; leave the window open, and let Harry try his fortune; if the bird &s;uffers him|&s;elf to be caught, when the path of freedom is before his eyes, it will be his own affair you know." &mdash; "But the act of catching him at all is arbi|trary," &s;aid John &s;turdily; throwing his hat at the orange, and other exotic plants, that grew in the direction of the tree where the Blackbird had been perched. "Not at all, brother," cried Henry, "when it is only to convey
<PB N="4" REF="12">
him to a better place;" running as he &s;pake, after the object of his wi&s;hes, almo&s;t with the &s;wiftne&s;s of its own wings. John kept always behind, in the hope of pointing its flight to the window; and James, the &s;econd bro|ther, &s;tood impartially in the middle, unle&s;s he &s;tept on one &s;ide or the other, to maintain fair dealing. The Blackbird, meantime, alarmed by all parties, flew irregularly, from &s;hrub to &s;hrub, from window to window, &s;ome|times beating his brea&s;t again&s;t one object, &s;ometimes &s;triking its wing or beak again&s;t another, often being in the very path of liberty, and as often driven out of it. At length it &s;ank exhau&s;ted to the ground, and was taken up, al|mo&s;t without an effort to flutter, by Henry, who&s;e little heart, quick breath|ing lip, and high colouring cheek,
<PB N="5" REF="13">
&s;poke his triumphs; yet, amid&s;t his exultings, he forgot not mercy: the faire&s;t laurel of the conqueror is huma|nity; and the very in&s;tincts of Henry were humane. He &s;moothed the ruf|fled plumes of his captive; poured over it every a&s;&s;urance of protection; pre&s;&s;ed its glo&s;&s;y pinion on his cheek; detained it with a &s;oft trembling hand, and at length putting it, lightly held, into his bo&s;om, ran with it into his chamber. "He has fairly won the bird, brother," &s;aid James, following. "Certainly," replied John, with a di&s;&s;atisfied tone, "nothing can be fairer than to run down a poor terrified little wretch, who has no power to re&s;i&s;t; then &s;eizing and dragging it to pri&s;on! It &s;truggled for freedom, till it was almo&s;t ga&s;ping for breath; and I am a&s;hamed that I
<PB N="6" REF="14">
&s;uffered any thing to prevent my taking part with the unprotected in the cau&s;e of liberty. But this, I &s;uppo&s;e, you and my brother will call foul play, ju&s;t as you have &s;tyled his thefts a kindne&s;s! Yes, the kindne&s;s of a chri&s;tian robber, who &s;teals the innocent &s;avage from his native land, and covers him with chains!" &mdash; Dreading the lo&s;s of his trea&s;ure, Henry guarded it with a mi&s;er's care; kept it concealed in his own room; but treated it with the ut|mo&s;t indulgence, being at once its nur&s;e and companion, and &s;uffering no hand but his own to feed it. "Alas! it droops," &s;aid its protector&mdash;bringing it down one day into an apartment where his brothers were &s;itting&mdash;"What can be done for it, James?" que&s;tioned he, with tears in his eyes. "Let it go,"
<PB N="7" REF="15">
interrupted John; "it pines for the friends from who&s;e &s;ociety it has been ravi&s;hed; it langui&s;hes for freedom: let it go, and it will &s;oon recover." "Per|haps," an&s;wered James, "it only wants more air, your chamber may be too confined: Suppo&s;e then," continued he, &mdash;willing to compromi&s;e betwixt liberty and &s;lavery, "you were to tie a &s;ilken &s;tring round its leg, and lead it now and then about the garden?" "I pro|po&s;e an improvement to that idea," &s;aid John&mdash;"clip one of its wings, and as you per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing it its right to fly in the air, let it have the run of the garden; that on the &s;outh-&s;ide of the ca&s;tle, you know, is walled round, and it cannot walk off." &mdash; He reconciled Henry to this mea&s;ure, by telling him that it would produce many good ends,
<PB N="8" REF="16">
be&s;ides re&s;toring the Blackbird's health, and giving it a reli&s;h for its former enjoyments; among&s;t other things, he a&s;&s;ured him, that it would recover its &s;pirits, which would enable it to whi&s;tle back its lo&s;t friends and relations. Henry could not re&s;i&s;t this: the idea of giving joy to others, was a joy to his own heart; the action by which it was be&s;towed could alone &s;urpa&s;s it.&mdash;In effect, the bird was all the better for its liberty; it hopped, pecked, twittered, and daily appeared to gain new vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>There was in the walled garden a &s;hed, where it ne&s;tled towards evening; but Henry, with &s;oft &s;teps, would take care while it repo&s;ed, to &s;trew food on the ground below, &s;o that it always found breakfa&s;t ready in the morning;
<PB N="9" REF="17">
nor was dinner or &s;upper provi&s;ion for|gotten; &s;o that what it picked up in the garden was mere amu&s;ement to reli&s;h exerci&s;e. The kind hearted Henry was <HI>perfectly</HI> &s;atisfied with this plan: John was only <HI>half</HI> &s;atisfied. James prudently &s;ugge&s;ted giving the growing wing another cutting. Henry agreed; for his favourite could now take half the garden at a low flight, though not top the walls. "Wait a little longer," &s;aid John; "He is &s;o tame, and &s;o well plea&s;ed with his pre&s;ent u&s;age, that perhaps he will indeed be a volun|teer among&s;t us, and there will be a thou&s;and times the gratification in hav|ing his &s;ociety with his own con&s;ent." "But if he &s;hould leave me?" &s;aid Henry. "Have confidence in him; think how delightful it is to have friend|&s;hip
<PB N="10" REF="18">
as a free-will offering: I &s;hould hate any thing I forced to &s;tay with me, as much as it could hate me. Can a jail-bird love the jailor?"&mdash;"I have a good mind to tru&s;t it," ob&s;erved Henry; "but I &s;ometimes think it looks up at the walls very &s;ly."&mdash;"That is nothing but a way they have with them," &s;aid John, laughing. "What is your opinion James?" que&s;tioned Henry. "There can be, I &s;hould think, but one opinion about that," replied James, taking out a little pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. "O, he always was for cutting out, ju&s;t like a girl; but act a more liberal part, my brother," &s;aid John; Henry was over-ruled. The feathers grew, and the Blackbird flew away. Henry accu&s;ed; John defended; James meditated. The grateful bird,
<PB N="11" REF="19">
however, &s;taid in the neighbourhood; &s;ang better, and looked happier. Henry was, therefore, reconciled to his lo&s;s, and John was at length contented.</P>

THE DUTCH DRAFT DOGS.</HEAD>
<P>WE are told by a traveller who has lately performed the tour of Holland, that the very dogs of that country are con&s;trained to promote the trade of the Republic; in&s;omuch, that there is not an <HI>idle</HI> Dog of any &s;ize in the Seven Provinces. You encounter at all hours of the day an incredible number loaded with fi&s;h <HI>and</HI> men, under
<PB N="13" REF="21">
the burden of which they run off at a long trot, and &s;ometimes, when driven by young men or boys, at full gallop, the whole mile and a half, which is the di&s;tance from gate to gate; nor on their return are they &s;uffered to come empty, being filled not only with the afore&s;aid men or boys, but with &s;uch commodi|ties as cannot be had at the village. The&s;e poor brutes are frequently to be &s;een in the middle of &s;ummer, urged beyond their force, till they have drop|ped on the road to gather &s;trength; which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, however, except when they have the misfortune to fall under the management of boys; for the Dutch are the farthe&s;t from being cruel to their dome&s;tic dumb animals of any people in the world; on the contrary, an Hollander, of what|ever
<PB N="14" REF="22">
rank, is merciful unto his cattle, whether hor&s;e, dog, cow, &amp;c. that they are the objects of his marked attention, as &s;leek &s;kins, happy faces, plump &s;ides, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate. The cows, and oxen for draft, they rub down, curry and clean, till they are as glo&s;&s;y as the mo&s;t pampered &s;teed in England. Nay, you frequently &s;ee them with a light fancy dre&s;s, to guard them from the flies and other annoying animalcula, in the meadows, which are the fine&s;t in the world, and in a warmer &s;uit of cloaths during the winter; even the&s;e canine-&s;laves look hale and well, as to condition, and, being habituated to labour, feel little hard&s;hip in it. It is fortunate, al&s;o, that Holland is a coun|try &s;omewhat prone to be &s;trict in the ceremonies of religion, by ob&s;ervance
<PB N="15" REF="23">
of which the dogs, like their ma&s;ters, find the &s;eventh a day of unbroken re&s;t: for "Sunday &s;hines a &s;abbath to them." The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, which is allowed a grand point, being much in favour of the&s;e indu&s;trious creatures. This tra|veller had an eye on them as well in the hours of their repo&s;e as toil; and felt his heart warm to &s;ee &s;everal, whom he had ob&s;erved to have &s;een very heavily laden on Saturday, taking a &s;ound nap, out-&s;tretched and happy at their ma&s;ter's doors, on the day in which their lei&s;ure is even an allotment and bounty of Heaven. All the morning and afternoon they have remained ba&s;k|ing in the &s;un, or in the &s;hade, in pro|found tranquillity; while a number of unthinking whelps, and lazy puppies, who had been pa&s;&s;ing their time in idlene&s;s all the week, were playing
<PB N="16" REF="24">
their gambols in the &s;treet, not with|out a vain attempt to wake the &s;erious, and make them join in their amu&s;e|ment. Towards evening, adds our traveller, I have, in my &s;un-&s;etting rounds, been much plea&s;ed to notice the hone&s;t creatures &s;it at their re&s;pec|tive thre&s;holds, looking quite refre&s;hed, giving occa&s;ionally into a momentary frolic, and the next morn returning to the labours of the week ab&s;olutely re|newed. Reader&mdash;Stranger&mdash;an't thou too proud of heart&mdash;or too full of dig|nity of human nature&mdash;to enter into the&s;e brute concerns? Pa&s;s on, then, and pity my weakne&s;s, but not without remembering that
<Q><L>Dogs are hone&s;t creatures,</L>
<L>Ne'er fawn on that they love not;</L>
<L>And, I'm a friend to Dogs. They</L>
<L>Ne'er betray their ma&s;ters.</L></Q>
<PB N="17" REF="25">
if, therefore, thou ha&s;t no feeling for their &s;ufferings, re&s;pect at lea&s;t their virtues:

THE HERMIT AND HIS DOG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN life's fair morn, I knew an aged &s;eer,</L>
<L>Who &s;ad and lonely pa&s;s'd his joyle&s;s year;</L>
<L>Betray'd, heart broken, from the world he ran,</L>
<L>And &s;hunn'd, O dire extreme! the face of man;</L>
<L>Humbly he rear'd his hut within the wood,</L>
<L>Hermit his ve&s;t, a hermit's was his food.</L>

<L><PB N="19" REF="27">The ling'ring day, and trickling as they fell,</L>
<L>A tear went with them to the narrow well;</L>
<L>Then thus he moraliz'd as &s;low it pa&s;t,</L>
<L>"This brings me nearer <HI>Lucia</HI> than the la&s;t;</L>
<L>And this, now &s;treaming from the eye," &s;aid he,</L>
<L>"Oh! my lov'd child, will bring me nearer thee."</L>
<L>When fir&s;t he roam'd, his Dog with anxious care,</L>
<L>His wand'rings watch'd, as emulous to &s;hare;</L>
<L>In vain the faithful brute was bid to go,</L>
<L>In vain the &s;orrower &s;ought a lonely woe.</L>
<L>The Hermit paus'd, the attendant Dog was near,</L>
<L>Slept at his feet, and caught the falling tear;</L>

THE DECAYED MERCHANT AND HIS DUTIFUL DAUGHTER.</HEAD>
<P>A MERCHANT, of con&s;iderable em|inence in London, was reduced to the &s;ituation of poor Ba&s;&s;anio, and from preci&s;ely the &s;ame run of ill-luck in his &s;ea adventures,
<Q><L>The dangerous rocks,</L>

<L>And not one ve&s;&s;el '&s;cap'd the dreadful touch.</L>
<L>Of merchant marring rocks.</L></Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e mi&s;carriages abroad, were added &s;imilar calamities at home. Seve|ral great hou&s;es broke in his debt, and with the wrecks of his fortune, gathered together, he left the metropolis, and took refuge in the mountains of Mont|gomery&s;hire. A little girl, then only nine years of age, his only &s;urviving child, was the &s;ole companion of his retreat, and &s;miled away his misfor|tunes. The care of her education was his mo&s;t certain relief from the corrod|ing reflections of the pa&s;t, and the cer|tainty of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at his death, &s;uf|ficient to prevent a good mind from the horrors of dependence, &s;oftened his thoughts of the future; the pre&s;ent was
<PB N="23" REF="31">
filled up with the delights of &s;eeing her ambition yet humbler than her fortunes, and literally bounded by the objects that &s;urrounded her. To tend the flowers &s;he had &s;et with her own hand, to nur&s;e the &s;hrubs the had planted, to &s;port with and feed the lamb &s;he had dome&s;|ticated, to &s;ee it follow her in her ram|bles, and to li&s;ten to the melodies of nature, as they murmured in the waters, or echoed through the woods, were her chief amu&s;ements without doors, and by a thou&s;and love-taught duties, to make a father forget that he had ever been unhappy, or unfortunate, her dear|e&s;t &s;tudy within. Of her per&s;onal attrac|tions I &s;hall &s;ay little: a &s;ingle line of Thom&s;on's gives the true&s;t image of them, and of the unaffected mind by which they were illumined,

Her own pure heart &s;upplied them all, and her own gentle hands admini&s;tered them. But now, for the fir&s;t time of her exi&s;|tence, &s;he added to her father's angui&s;h.

<P>The la&s;t &s;entence &s;eemed to annihi|late the re&s;t.

of her poor father's phy&s;ician, on who&s;e heart &s;he now re&s;olved to make an attempt, by the medium of the generous &s;tranger, who &s;he rightly judged, would &s;uffer his bounty to take any direction &s;he might wi&s;h, and to whom &s;he &s;tated the merchant's anxi|ous, but hopele&s;s de&s;ires.</P>

it as it li&s;teth. Let me ha&s;ten to make atonement, by informing you, that our lovely &s;ufferer, on her recovery, had the plea&s;ure to find her father had do&s;ed be&s;t part of the morning, and though he mi&s;&s;ed her, from his apartment, when he awoke, he told the nur&s;e, that he hoped &s;he was taking a little nece&s;|&s;ary re&s;t in her own room, where he de&s;ired &s;he might remain undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>This gave her opportunity to manage her good fortune, of which &s;he re&s;olved to be &s;o excellent an oeconomi&s;t, that the &s;upply &s;he had received &s;hould an|&s;wer the wi&s;e&s;t and happie&s;t purpo&s;es: &s;he recollected that the day before &s;he met the benevolent &s;tranger, her father had received by the po&s;t a Bank-bill, to the amount of the quarterly divi&s;ion of

his annuity; of cour&s;e a farther rein|forcement was not immediately nece&s;|&s;ary; on which account &s;he had to regret, that the flurry into which her &s;pirits were thrown, had hindred her from per&s;i&s;ting in her refu&s;al of the loan, to the acceptance of which, how|ever, &s;he was &s;omewhat reconciled, when &s;he reflected on the condition annexed to her borrowing it; and an idea, which ju&s;t then &s;tarted to her imagination, of the manner in which it might be appropriated, completely &s;atisfied her feelings on the occa&s;ion. She con&s;idered the gentleman's Bank-bill as the luckie&s;t fund in the world, to &s;erve as the phy&s;ician's fee, in ca&s;e the generous &s;tranger &s;hould prevail on him to come, and to that &s;acred u&s;e her heart devoted it. The &s;um was fifty

pounds. A recompence which her ignorance in the price of medical ad|vice in the golden climes of England led her to &s;uppo&s;e would be all-&s;uffi|cient for a journey down to Wales. Alas! were a regular charge to be made out by Doctors W, R, G, F, L, or any other of the popular &s;ons of E&s;culapius, of London, for &s;uch a tour from the grand mart of cu&s;tom, the fifty pound would &s;carcely be thought by tho&s;e me&s;&s;ieurs a more than &s;ufficient &s;um to pay travelling expences. In many parts of the continent, indeed, where a &s;hilling value in coin that has. le&s;s of &s;ilver in its compo&s;ition than would be found in the analy&s;is of a &s;ilver penny, is received as a &s;ettled gratuity for running a German mile, fifty pounds would cut a hand&s;ome figure

<P>As, however, the vi&s;it of Dr. ****** was a point rather "devoutly to be wi&s;hed" than expected, it being the middle of a very hard winter, Amelia thought it prudent to conceal the little adventure at the public hou&s;e from her father, who&s;e malady, neverthele&s;s, ra|ther increa&s;ed than abated, and his love of life being in effect his love for his daughter, he could not help occa&s;ion|ally regretting his impa&s;&s;able di&s;tance from the only man by who&s;e aid there might be a chance of re&s;i&s;ting his di&s;|ea&s;e. There is, you know, a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;tition which often runs through

a family in favour of its family phy|&s;ician. Nor is it altogether without a &s;upport from rea&s;on, &s;ince the per&s;on who has long been in the &s;ecrets of our con&s;titution, and familiar with our habits of living, mu&s;t, in all general ca&s;es, be better able to apply the pro|per remedies, than he who is called into our bed chambers, when there is a di&s;ea&s;e in it, and when he &s;ees us for the fir&s;t time under its influence: be|&s;ides which, an old phy&s;ician is com|monly an old friend, and unites the lenitives of affection to the cathartics of &s;cience; no wonder, then, that we have faith in him, and faith, you know, is a a great doctor in it&s;elf, performing a thou&s;and cures, which the highe&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ional &s;kill has not been able to ac|compli&s;h without it.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="53">You will readily believe, that the bountiful &s;tranger did not break pro|mi&s;e to Amelia.

You, my friend, who&s;e fancy is ever warmed by your affectionate heart, will imme|diately conclude what was concluded by Amelia, that it could be only the much-de&s;ired Doctor, who had thus delicately, to prevent the ill effect of &s;urprize on the &s;ick merchant, announc|ed his arrival. If &s;o, you are in the right. However incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uch a long journey might be, it was perfectly in uni&s;on with the &s;pirit of benevolence by which

Let us fly this in&s;tant! exclaimed Amelia, in the animated accents of nature&mdash;let us do all things in order, replied the Doctor,
<PB N="47" REF="55">
in the language of friendly di&s;cretion, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall do more harm than good.&mdash;I pre&s;ume I am not expected? Amelia bowed a negative. Then my &s;udden appearance would make thy father wor&s;e, child, continued the Doc|tor. No; go back to him, and by telling him an old friend of his from London, and who has particular bu&s;i|ne&s;s in that part of Wales which he inhabits, means to pay him a vi&s;it on the &s;core of ancient amity, and will take cottage fare from him in his cham|ber. The name of this old London friend will then be a matter of amu&s;e|ing conjecture, in the mid&s;t of which thou, child, may&s;t &s;ugge&s;t that thou &s;hould&s;t not wonder if it were me, tell|ing him as much of the adventure that I find happened at this inn, between

Her father was &s;itting up in his bed, &s;upported by pillows, which the aged adherent had made &s;hift to place in the ab&s;ence of
<PB N="49" REF="57">
his filial nur&s;e, who gently chid the old woman for taking her proper bu&s;ine&s;s out of her hands; but that, if her dear father had found a moment's ea&s;e by this u&s;urpation of her natural rights, &s;he would then forgive the u&s;urper. She then entered on her errand, which &s;he managed &s;o well, as to make the old friend's name, after much plea&s;ant con|jecture on both &s;ides, the &s;ubject of a wager; the father ob&s;erving, that if it &s;hould prove to belong to the Doctor, Providence had &s;ent him to reward the virtue of his daughter, who on her part maintained, that it would be chiefly owing to the value which heaven it&s;elf would &s;et on her parent's life. This amicable &s;trife had put the invalid into unwonted &s;pirits, and thereby, perhaps, not only prepared the way for the cure

of a fever on the nerves, but laid the be&s;t foundation of it. The poor gen|tleman did not dare to lay any &s;tre&s;s on the po&s;&s;ibility of a vi&s;it from the phy|&s;ician, and yet a faint blu&s;h of hope de|noted that he &s;hould think him&s;elf mo&s;t happy to lo&s;e his wager.</P>
<P>At this au&s;picious cri&s;is it was, that our Doctor made his entr&egrave;, &s;aying, as he advanced to the bed-&s;ide, "My e&s;teemed friend, I am come to return my per&s;onal thanks to thee, for having me in thy thoughts when thou wert too &s;ick to remember any but tho&s;e who are dear to thee, and of whom thou ha&s;t a good opinion.

<P>The emotions of Amelia during the&s;e favourable progno&s;tications no words can tell you. The Merchant was &s;trongly affected. The Doctor per|ceived that his patient was recoverable, both in the maladies of body and mind; and as he was no le&s;s a philo&s;opher and philanthropi&s;t than a phy&s;ician, he could with equal &s;kill pre&s;cribe for each. He was one of the people called Quakers; and to a perfect knowledge of the world,

of his profe&s;&s;ion, and of the human heart, united all the hone&s;t plainne&s;s of the character. The Merchant's di&s;|order was, as I have &s;aid, a fever on the &s;pirits, of which the &s;ymptoms were, as u&s;ual, want of appetite, la&s;&s;i|tude, watchfulne&s;s, and dejection of mind: a pul&s;e &s;low and creeping, dif|ficulty of re&s;piration, and a dread, yet hope, of death.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that in this di&s;|ea&s;e the cathartics of the mind, &s;uch as exhilarate, enliven, and amu&s;e the patient, are the mo&s;t effectual remedies, and &s;uch as were admini&s;tered with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion. In le&s;s than a fortnight, the &s;ick man not only was in a condition to leave his bed, but his chamber, and

play his part in the little cottage par|lour, in a thou&s;and little frolics that Amelia and the Doctor devi&s;ed to en|tertain him: in the cour&s;e of the third week, he re&s;umed his accu&s;tomed ex|erci&s;es; and under the cordial &s;upports of his friend and his child, he could a&s;cend the mountains that environed his habitation. In the middle of the fourth week, his &s;pirits and &s;trength were &s;o well re&s;tored, that in returning home to dinner, after a walk of &s;ome miles, he jocularly propo&s;ed to run again&s;t the Doctor and Amelia for a wager; which being agreed upon by the other parties, he &s;et off, and beat them both. It was in the afternoon of this victorious day, that the good Doctor intimated the nece&s;&s;ity of his return to town; good-humouredly ob|&s;erving,
<PB N="54" REF="62">
that, although by a lucky ar|rangement, he had left his &s;ick and wounded in very good hands with a brother phy&s;ician in London, he could not tre&s;pa&s;s any longer, without fear of being &s;et down by the college as a de&s;erter, and he mu&s;t therefore repair to head-quarters in the morning.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of this was ad|mitted: yet the Merchant &s;ighed, and Amelia wept. The Doctor knew it mu&s;t be done, and he &s;aw that his pro|phecy, as to his friend's recovery, was fulfilled to his heart's content; but there is a &s;ympathy in generous regret, and his eyes were not more dry than Amelia's. In de&s;pite of exertions, the evening pa&s;t heavily away: the morn|ing did not ri&s;e without ca&s;ting clouds
<PB N="55" REF="63">
on every countenance. The hour, the almo&s;t in&s;tant, that was to &s;eparate the cottagers from their pre&s;erver, ap|proached.</P>
<P>Friend, &s;aid the Doctor to his pa|tient, as he heard the wheels of his carriage advancing, &s;ince I &s;aw thee la&s;t in the great city, I have pro&s;pered exceedingly. All tho&s;e families, to whom thou tooke&s;t me by the hand, were, more for thy &s;ake than mine, on <HI>my li&s;t.</HI> Some merit, however, or infi|nite good fortune, I mu&s;t needs have had &s;ince, from an yearly gain of one hundred, I have increa&s;ed my income to &s;everal thou&s;ands per annum; and yet, I do not take fees for one in forty of my pre&s;criptions.&mdash;My hou&s;e is too large for my family&mdash;Wilt thou come
<PB N="56" REF="64">
once again into the bu&s;y world, with this mountain blo&s;&s;om, and occupy &s;ome of the apartments? &mdash; This as thou wilt.&mdash;At pre&s;ent I mu&s;t give thee a few words of parting advice, and mu&s;t rely on this dam&s;el to &s;ee that it is adopted. Thou art &s;o much thy former &s;elf, friend, that I fear not a relap&s;e; but, to fortify and &s;trengthen thee in my ab&s;ence, I have written, and made up, a pre&s;cription, which, I am convinced, hits thy ca&s;e exactly. Hear|ing &s;omething of thy maladies from the friend who conveyed to me thy Ame|lia's me&s;&s;age, and forming a judgment, &s;oberly, thereupon, I brought with me &s;uch drugs as I thought could not be readily procured in thy neighbourhood. They lie, however, in a &s;mall compa&s;s, even in this little box, yet, being com|pounds
<PB N="57" REF="65">
of peculiar &s;trength, they will la&s;t you, I judge, for at lea&s;t a year to come, probably more&mdash;if they &s;hould not, thou knowe&s;t where to addre&s;s the pre&s;criber for a fre&s;h &s;upply. There, friend, take it, but do not open it till you &s;eem to wi&s;h for &s;omething of a <HI>cordial</HI> nature. It will then, I have no doubt, do thee good.</P>
<P>He received their tearful embraces, and departed. You are impatient to lift up the lid of the box. When it was opened by the Merchant and his Daughter, they di&s;covered two &s;eparate pieces of paper, each containing a draft, on a different banker, for <HI>one thou&s;and pounds</HI> &mdash; the one, a pre&s;ent from the phy&s;ician, the other from the &s;tranger who had given him an account of this little family. Wrapt round the&s;e drafts
<PB N="58" REF="66">
was a &s;lip of paper, in the Doctor's hand-writing, containing the&s;e words &mdash;"Tributes, from the friends of filial piety and parental love."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not deny you the gratification of knowing that the father recovered, and the child added to his ble&s;&s;ings, and her own, many years; in the &s;mil|ing cour&s;e of which, the young lady's virtues attracted the affections of a very wealthy and worthy gentleman, who&s;e power and inclinations not only enabled the Merchant to make re&s;titu|tion of the genero&s;ity received from the phy&s;ician; but to make al&s;o the re&s;idue of that man's life, from whom he derived the be&s;t and lovelie&s;t of wives, as happy in pro&s;perity as it had been re&s;pectable in misfortune.</P>

THE DOVE.</HEAD>
<P>THE tran&s;actions and friendly inter|cour&s;e of <HI>Noah</HI> and his <HI>Dove,</HI> have a tenderne&s;s and ceremony in them truly delightful. The eye melts at the &s;implicity, and the heart warms at the &s;entiment. Poetry, in her happie&s;t flight, could imagine nothing more in|tere&s;ting to the fancy. Hail, gentle&s;t of birds!&mdash;Hail, me&s;&s;enger of &s;ecurity!
<PB N="64" REF="72">
Through thy means was the dry ground di&s;covered, and the gratitude of man &s;hall not ea&s;ily forget the fidelity of the Dove! He &s;ent forth the Dove to &s;ee if the waters were abated. What an important errand, for &s;o &s;mall an ex|pre&s;s! Yet the indu&s;trious little wing flew over the wafry univer&s;e, and em|ployed every feather in the &s;ervice of man: after a vain excur&s;ion &s;he re|turned; for the waters were &s;till with|out a &s;hore. Methinks I &s;ee the Pa|triarch &s;tand upon the deck, to wait the return of his me&s;&s;enger, and as &s;oon as &s;he re&s;ts her fatigued foot upon the ark, he tenderly puts forth his hand and pulls her to him: thus rewarded for her labours, after &s;even days repo&s;e, her a&s;&s;i&s;tance being again &s;ummoned, &s;he tru&s;ts to her pinions; and, lo! in
<PB N="65" REF="73">
the evening, &s;he came. By mention of the evening, it &s;hould appear that &s;he was di&s;patched in the morning, or, at lea&s;t very early in the day. What a ta&s;k of toil mu&s;t it then have been! How many billowy leagues mu&s;t &s;he have travelled ere &s;he found that of which &s;he was in &s;earch! Linger upon the land, we may be convinced &s;he never did, however the verdure and vegetable novelty might charm her. No! it was not till the evening &s;he &s;ucceeded in her endeavours, and then, upon the wings of kindne&s;s, &s;he ha&s;ted to &s;atisfy the impatience of her ma&s;ter. Upon her &s;econd return, behold a leaf was in her mouth! What a &s;weet way is here of communicating the happy tidings! But, indeed, every &s;yllable
<PB N="66" REF="74">
of this matter hath a grace and a con|&s;equence peculiar to it: it was an OLIVE leaf which &s;he bore; the leaf of amity, the emblem of peace; as much as to &s;ay, lo! ma&s;ter, the waters are abated, and I have plucked a leaf as a te&s;timony of my truth! The power who commandeth the waves to dry up and di&s;appear, hath ordained me to bear to thee this olive-branch; haply it is the pledge of promi&s;e and con|ciliation betwixt him and thee; and thou &s;halt not only &s;et thy foot &s;afely upon land, but there pro&s;per and enjoy the pardon of God. And after &s;even days more, he &s;ent her forth again, and &s;he returned no more. One is divided here betwixt &s;miles and tears; it is an exqui&s;ite pa&s;&s;age. The land and earth
<PB N="67" REF="75">
had, by this time, re&s;umed their ac|cu&s;tomed beauties; the trees di&s;played a greener glory, the flowers &s;prung brighter from the wave, and the Dove having performed her duty, enjoyed, as directed, the beauties of renovated verdure. Yet &s;he returned no more. Noah, though he knew the cau&s;e of her delay, had lo&s;t his favourite bird. Alas! it was a drawback upon the felicity of the new-appearing world. Fie upon the heart that has not feel|ings upon &s;uch occa&s;ions! The &s;oft|ne&s;s of the Dove, however, is &s;till held among the children of men, in grate|ful remembrance. She is equally cele|brated in prophane and &s;acred hi&s;tory, and every epithet of endearment is allotted to her. She is con&s;idered as favourable to love, and propitious to

every tender undertaking; nor can we, at any time, expre&s;s a courteous cha|racter without giving to it, among other qualities, the gentlene&s;s and truth of <HI>the Dove.</HI></P>

endures it no longer than ju&s;t to walk &s;olemnly, "with gho&s;tly &s;teps and &s;low," into the gentleman's hou&s;e, to eat the food, which he probably takes becau&s;e he would not wi&s;h to part with, or &s;horten his &s;orrows, or to ter|minate them amid&s;t the &s;acred du&s;t of &s;ome loved friend, over which he is now the generous centinel. Yet, in this effort of perpetuating his &s;ympa|thy, and of grudging the moments that are &s;tolen from it, he is not repre&s;ented as a being apt to form new attach|ments, or who wi&s;hes to expunge the old, by the force of novelty. He is a &s;teady martyr to his fidelity, and know|eth nor the &s;hadow of changing. On the contrary, even the &s;weet voice of benevolence, which would call him into pro&s;perity, and the liberal hand
<PB N="81" REF="89">
which offers the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;o &s;orely wanted, have no corrupting power of &s;educing him into one hour's forgetfulne&s;s. The great duty of the mourner's life is evidently drawn to a point&mdash;that of attending the a&s;hes of an ancient benefactor in the progre&s;s of mortal decay. From this no bribes, no bounties can entice him; and, won|derful to tell! no &s;ooner is nature's meane&s;t want ab&s;temiou&s;ly as rapidly abated, (for he &s;eems to grudge the time &s;o wa&s;ted) than the memory of the dear charge he has for&s;aken, returns invigorated upon him, and he entombs him&s;elf again in this pious manner for three or four days: then once more he crawls forth, lean and emaciated, his eyes &s;unk, his hair di&s;hevelled, and with every other mark of the pri&s;oner and
<PB N="82" REF="90">
the mourner. Thus does he, <HI>literally</HI> pa&s;s his days and nights "in the dark|ne&s;s and &s;hadow of death." No &s;un to cheer, no companion to &s;oothe him. It may not be omitted, for it is a cir|cum&s;tance too honourable to his prin|ciples of affection, and to which truth gives her &s;anction, that his terrene ha|bitation is rendered additionally uncom|fortable by a kind of thoroughfare &s;ink, which conducts the noi&s;ome damps along his cave; &s;o that his po&s;t of honour, which is a &s;ick-bed, is made in the waters, and all the horrors of an ill-aired dungeon mu&s;t &s;urround him: but his tender nature recks not this&mdash;Love endureth all things. In coming &s;ud|denly into day, he is repre&s;ented as feeling no kind of fe&s;tivity at the tran|&s;ition, either from the fanning of the
<PB N="83" REF="91">
breeze or fervour of the &s;un; none of tho&s;e rebounds of joy, or fond elevations, that denote an <HI>ordinary</HI> dog's relea&s;e from a long and painful confinement. No:&mdash;his character is uniform. This <HI>Pen&s;ero&s;o-morali&s;t</HI> is a volunteer in cap|tivity; and if in his way from the vaults to his hou&s;e of feeding, he encounters any of his own kind (from his coffin to his kitchen, which is the utmo&s;t limit of his journey,) it has been ob&s;erved that he takes no notice of their bearing the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ed form of nature, as if the connecting band was torn from the living, and transferred to the dead; he takes his ha&s;ty repa&s;t&mdash;his nece&s;&s;ary mor&s;el, and retires to bury him&s;elf alive in his &s;able retreat. His friend|&s;hip &s;eems to have worn out the very di&s;tinction of &s;ex; and the female form,
<PB N="84" REF="92">
with all its attractions, is ab&s;orbed in that thick night of &s;ad &s;en&s;ation which hath &s;eized upon his heart; yet he is not ungrateful, nor unmindful of the dues of ho&s;pitality. To the &s;ervant maid of the hou&s;e who prepares his pottage, again&s;t his hour of <HI>re&s;urrection from the dead,</HI> he expre&s;&s;es a decent &s;en&s;e of acknowledgment. He is not &s;ullen, but &s;orrowful; but he keeps aloof, and "dips his mor&s;el in the vinegar" re|&s;ervedly, which I take to hint civilly to his benefactor, his wi&s;hes to avoid all approximation to intimacy. It is ea&s;y to tran&s;late the Dog's heart upon this circum&s;tance, as well as if we could &s;ee into his generous bo&s;om. It runs thus: &mdash;"To &s;hew my good principles, I pay thee my tender thanks; but prithee, dam&s;el, attempt not my affections: they
<PB N="85" REF="93">
are &s;o entirely engaged, that I have not &s;o much as might be put into a wren's eye, for any other of thy &s;pecies or my own." We are very much afraid, that the kind-hearted wench will &s;uffer her good nature to get the better of her di&s;cretion, and that &s;he will <HI>bewoman</HI> away the Dog's morals, till he becomes no better than an human being. No; we injure him.&mdash;The <HI>fame,</HI> the <HI>immor|tality</HI> of the Dog require, that he &s;hould continue incon&s;olable. One week's feli|city&mdash;yea, one moment's mirth, would ruin his reputation with us for ever; and by all that's honourable in nature, or graceful in the affections, we had rather creep into his &s;epulchre, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him on his ma&s;ter's tomb, and we are &s;ure the generous reader would do the &s;ame, than have him
<PB N="86" REF="94">
grow fat, and get into fle&s;h, and recover, yea, but a little, the tone of his mind. It is for his glory he "&s;hould go mourn|ing all his life long;" and&mdash;which love forbid!&mdash;&s;hould he be ever ba&s;e enough to hold up his head again, or to prance it about like the other heedle&s;s happy puppies of this world, who &s;o ea&s;ily forget they ever lo&s;t a friend, why, the only con&s;i&s;tent character we have ever met will be de&s;troyed.</P>

</FIGURE> THE BIRD-CATCHER AND HIS CANARY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the town of Cleves, an Eng|li&s;h gentleman was re&s;iding with a Pru&s;&s;ian family, during the time of the fair, which we &s;hall pa&s;s over, having nothing remarkable to di&s;tingui&s;h it from other annual meetings where people a&s;&s;emble to &s;tare at, cheat each other, and divert them&s;elves, and to &s;pend the year's &s;avings in buying
<PB N="91" REF="99">
tho&s;e bargains which would have been probably better bought at home. One day after dinner, as the de&s;ert was ju&s;t brought on the table, the travelling German mu&s;icians, who commonly ply the hou&s;es at the&s;e times, pre&s;ented them&s;elves and were &s;uffered to play, and ju&s;t as they were making their bows for the money they received for their hamony, a <HI>Bird-catcher,</HI> who had rendered him&s;elf famous for educating and calling forth the talents of the feathered race, made his appearance, and was well received by the party, which was numerous and benevolent. The mu&s;icians, who had heard of this Bird-catcher's fame, begged permi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay; and the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who had a great &s;hare of good nature, indulged their curio&s;ity, a curio&s;ity in|deed
<PB N="92" REF="100">
in which every body participated: for all that we have heard or &s;een of <HI>learned-pigs,</HI> a&s;&s;es, dogs, and hor&s;es, was &s;aid to be extingui&s;hed in the wonder|ful wi&s;dom which blazed in the genius of this Bird-catcher's <HI>Canary.</HI> The Canary was produced, and the owner harrangued him in the following man|ner, placing him upon his fore-finger, <HI>Bijou,</HI> jewel, you are now in the pre|&s;ence of per&s;ons of great &s;agacity and honour: take heed you do not deceive the expectations they have conceived of you from the world's report: you have got laurels: beware their wither|ing: in a word, deport your&s;elf like the <HI>bijou</HI>&mdash;the jewel&mdash;of the Canary Birds, as you certainly are. All this time the Bird &s;eemed to li&s;ten, and indeed, placed him&s;elf in the true attitude of
<PB N="93" REF="101">
attention, by &s;loping his head to the ear of the man, and then di&s;tinctly nodding twice, when his ma&s;ter left off &s;peaking; and if ever nods were intelligible and promi&s;&s;ory, the&s;e were two of them. That's good, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, pulling off his hat to the bird. Now, then, let us &s;ee if you are a Canary of honour. Give us a tune:&mdash;the Canary &s;ung. P&s;haw! that's too har&s;h: 'tis the note of a raven, with a hoar&s;ene&s;s upon him: &s;omething pathetic. The Canary whi&s;|tled as if his little throat was changed to a lute. Fa&s;ter, &s;ays the man&mdash;&s;lower &mdash;very well&mdash;what a plague is this foot about, and this little head?&mdash;No won|der you are out, Mr. <HI>Bijou,</HI> when you forget your time. That's a jewel&mdash; <HI>bravo! bravo!</HI> my little man! All that he was ordered, or reminded of, did he
<PB N="94" REF="102">
do to admiration. His head and foot beat time&mdash;humoured the variations both of tone and movement; and "the &s;ound was a ju&s;t echo to the &s;en&s;e," according to the &s;tricte&s;t laws of poe|tical, and (as it <HI>ought</HI> to be) of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition&mdash;<HI>bravo! bravo!</HI> re-echoed from all parts of the dining-room. The mu&s;icians declared the Canary was a greater ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic than any of their band. And do you not &s;hew your &s;en&s;e of this civility, Sir? cried the Bird-catcher with an angry air. The Canary bow'd mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, to the great delight of the company. His next atchievement was going through martial exerci&s;e with a &s;traw gun, after which, my poor <HI>bijou,</HI> &s;ays the owner, thou ha&s;t had hard work, and mu&s;t be a little weary: a few per|formances
<PB N="95" REF="103">
more, and thou &s;halt repo&s;e. Shew the ladies how to make a curte&s;y. The bird here cro&s;&s;ed his taper legs, and &s;unk, and ro&s;e with an ea&s;e and grace that would have put half our &s;ub&s;cription-a&s;&s;embly <HI>belles</HI> to the blu&s;h. That's my fine bird!&mdash;and now a bow, head and foot corre&s;ponding. Here the &s;triplings for ten miles round Lon|don might have blu&s;hed al&s;o. Let us fini&s;h with a hornpipe, my brave little fellow&mdash;that's it&mdash;keep it up, keep it up. The activity, glee, &s;pirit, accuracy, with which this la&s;t order was obeyed, wound up the applau&s;e, (in which all the mu&s;icians joined, as well with their in&s;truments as with their clappings,) to the highe&s;t pitch of admiration. Bijou him&s;elf &s;eemed to feel the &s;acred thir&s;t of fame, and &s;hook his little
<PB N="96" REF="104">
plumes, and carroled an <HI>Io paean</HI> that &s;ounded like the con&s;cious notes of victory. Thou ha&s;t done all my bid|dings bravely, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, care&s;&s;ing his feathered &s;ervant; now then take a nap, while I take thy place. Here|upon the Canary went into a counter|feit &s;lumber, &s;o like the effect of the poppied-god, fir&s;t &s;hutting one eye, then the other, then nodding, then dropping &s;o much on one &s;ide, that the hands of &s;everal of the company were &s;tretched out to &s;ave him from falling, and ju&s;t as tho&s;e hands approached his feathers, &s;uddenly recovering, and dropping as much on the other; at length &s;leep &s;eemed to fix him in a &s;teady po&s;ture; whereupon the owner took him from his finger, and laid him flat on the table, where the man a&s;&s;ured us he would re|main
<PB N="97" REF="105">
in a good &s;ound &s;leep, while he him&s;elf had the honour to do his be&s;t to fill up the interval. Accordingly, after drinking a gla&s;s of wine, (in the progre&s;s of taking which he was inter|rupted by the Canary-bird &s;pringing &s;uddenly up to a&s;&s;ert his right to a &s;hare, really putting his little bill into the gla&s;s, and then laying him&s;elf down to &s;leep again) the owner called him a &s;aucy fellow, and began to &s;hew off his own independent powers of entertain|ing. The <HI>forte</HI> of the&s;e lay chiefly in balancing with a tobacco-pipe, while he &s;moaked with another; and &s;everal of the po&s;itions were &s;o difficult to be pre&s;erved, yet maintained with &s;uch dexterity, that the general attention was fixed upon him. But while he was thus exhibiting, an huge BLACK
<PB N="98" REF="106">
CAT, who had been no doubt on the watch, from &s;ome unob&s;erved corner &s;prung upon the table, &s;eized the poor Canary in its mouth, and ru&s;hed out of the window in de&s;pite of all oppo|&s;ition. Though the dining-room was emptied in an in&s;tant, it was a vain pur&s;uit; the life of the bird was gone, and its mangled body was brought in by the unfortunate owner in &s;uch di&s;|may, accompanied by &s;uch looks and language, as mu&s;t have awakened pity in a <HI>mi&s;anthrope.</HI> He &s;pread him&s;elf half length over the table, and mourned his Canary-bird with the mo&s;t undi&s;|&s;embled &s;orrow. "Well may I grieve for thee, my poor little thing; well may I grieve: more than four years ha&s;t thou fed from my hand, drank from my lip, and &s;lept in my bo&s;om.
<PB N="99" REF="107">
I owe to thee my &s;upport, my health, my &s;trength, and my happine&s;s; with|out thee, what will become of me? Thou it was that did&s;t en&s;ure my wel|come in the be&s;t companies. It was thy genius only made me welcome. Thy death is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for my va|nity: had I relied on thy happy pow|ers, all had been well, and thou had&s;t been perched on my finger, or lulled on my brea&s;t, at this moment! But tru&s;ting to my own talents, and glorify|ing my&s;elf in them, a judgment has fallen upon me, and thou art dead and mangled on this table. Accur&s;ed be the hour I entered this hou&s;e! and more accur&s;ed the dete&s;table mon&s;ter that killed thee! Accur&s;ed be <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> for I contributed. I ought not to have taken away my eyes when thine were
<PB N="100" REF="108" MS="y">
clo&s;ed in frolic. O <HI>Bijou!</HI> my deare&s;t, only <HI>Bijou!</HI> would I were dead al&s;o!"</P>
<P>As near as the &s;pirit of his di&s;ordered mind can be transfu&s;ed, &s;uch was the language and &s;entiment of the forlorn Bird-catcher; who&s;e de&s;pairing motion and frantic air no words can paint. He took from his pocket a little green bag of faded velvet, and drawing from out of it &s;ome wool and cotton, that were the wrapping of whi&s;tles, bird-calls, and other in&s;truments of his trade, all of which he threw on the table, "as in &s;corn," and making a couch, placed the mutilated limbs and ra|vaged feathers of his Canary upon it, and renewed his lamentations. The&s;e were now much &s;oftened, as is ever the ca&s;e when the rage of grief yields to
<PB N="101" REF="109">
its tenderne&s;s; when it is too much overpowered by the effect to advert to the cau&s;e. It is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that every one of the company &s;ym|pathized with him. But none more than the band of <HI>mu&s;icians,</HI> who, being engaged in a profe&s;&s;ion that naturally keeps the &s;en&s;ibilities more or le&s;s in exerci&s;e, felt the di&s;tre&s;s of the poor Bird-man with peculiar force. It was really a banquet to &s;ee the&s;e people gathering them&s;elves into a knot, and, after whi&s;pering, wiping their eyes, and blowing their no&s;es, depute one from among&s;t them to be the medium of conveying into the pocket of the Bird-man, the very contribution they had ju&s;t before received for their own efforts. The poor fellow perceiving them, took from the pocket the little
<PB N="102" REF="110">
parcel they had rolled up, and brought with it, by an unlucky accident, ano|ther little bag, at the &s;ight of which he was extremely agitated; for it con|tained the canary-&s;eed, the food of the "dear lo&s;t companion of his heart." There is no giving language to the effect of this trifling circum&s;tance upon the poor fellow; he threw down the contribution-money that he brought from his pocket along with it, not with an ungrateful, but a de&s;perate hand. He opened the bag, which was fa&s;|tened with red tape, and taking out &s;ome of the &s;eed, put it to the very bill of the lifele&s;s bird, exclaiming, "No, poor <HI>Bijou!</HI> no,&mdash;thou can'&s;t not peck any more out of this hand that has been thy feeding place &s;o many years: &mdash;thou can'&s;t not remember how happy
<PB N="103" REF="111">
we both were when I bought this bag full for thee. Had it been filled with gold thou had&s;t de&s;erved it."&mdash;It &s;hall be <HI>filled</HI>&mdash;and with gold, &s;aid the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, if I could afford it. The good man ro&s;e from his &s;eat, which had been long unea&s;y to him, and gently taking the bag, put into it &s;ome &s;ilver; &s;aying as he handed it to his neare&s;t neighbour, who will refu&s;e to follow my example? It is not a &s;ub&s;cription for mere charity; it is a tribute to one of the rare&s;t things in the whole world; namely, to real feeling, in this &s;ophi&s;ti|cal, pretending, parading age. If ever the pa&s;&s;ion of love and gratitude was in the heart of man, it is in the heart of that unhappy fellow; and whether the object that calls out &s;uch feelings be bird, bea&s;t, fi&s;h, or man, it is alike
<PB N="104" REF="112">
virtue, and&mdash;Ought to be rewarded&mdash; &s;aid his next neighbour, putting into the bag his quota. It is &s;uperfluous to tell you, that after the &s;eed had been taken wholly away, and put very deli|cately out of the poor man's &s;ight, every body mo&s;t cheerfully contributed to make up a pur&s;e, to repair, as much as money could, the Bird-man's lo&s;s. The la&s;t per&s;on applied to was a very beautiful <HI>German</HI> young lady, who, as &s;he placed her bounty into the bag, clo&s;ed it immediately after, and blu&s;hed. As there are all &s;orts of blu&s;hes (at lea&s;t one to every action of our lives that is worth any characteri&s;tic feeling, &s;up|po&s;ing the actor can feel at all) <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> would have thought this young lady, who was &s;o anxious to conceal her gift, gave little or nothing; but <HI>Candour,</HI> who
<PB N="105" REF="113">
rea&s;ons in a different manner, would &s;uppo&s;e what was really the ca&s;e&mdash;that it was a blu&s;h not of avarice or decep|tion, but of benevolence, graced with mode&s;ty. <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> however, caught the bag, opened it, and turned out its con|tents, among&s;t which were a <HI>golden ducat,</HI> that, by its date and brightne&s;s, had been hoarded. Ah! ha! &s;aid Curio|&s;ity, who does this belong to, I wonder? Guilt and innocence, avarice and benig|nity, are alike hone&s;t in one point; &s;ince they all in the moment of attack, by &s;ome means or other, di&s;cover what they wi&s;h to conceal. There was not in the then large company a &s;ingle per|&s;on, who could not have exclaimed to this young lady, with a&s;&s;urance of the truth&mdash;<HI>Thou art the woman!</HI> There was no denying the fact; it was written
<PB N="106" REF="114">
on every feature of her enchanting face. She &s;truggled, however, with the ac|cu&s;ation almo&s;t to tears, but they were &s;uch tears as would have given lu&s;tre to the fine&s;t eyes in the world; for they gave lu&s;tre to her's, and would have added effulgence to a ray of the &s;un. Well, then, if nobody el&s;e will own this neglected ducat, &s;aid the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who was uncle to the lady above-mentioned, I will: whereupon he took it from the heap, exchanged it for two others, which enriched the collec|tion. While the bu&s;ine&s;s of the heart was thus carrying on, the poor Bird|man, who was the occa&s;ion and object of it, was at fir&s;t divided by contrary emotions of pain and plea&s;ure: his eye &s;ometimes directed to the ma&s;&s;acred Canary, &s;ometimes to the company; at
<PB N="107" REF="115">
length genero&s;ity proved the &s;tronger emotion, and grief ebbed away. He had lo&s;t a bird, but he had gained the good-will of human beings. The bird, it was true, was his pride and &s;upport, but this was not the cri&s;is any longer to bewail his fate. He accepted the con|tribution-pur&s;e, by one means or other filled like the &s;ack of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> even to the brim, and bowed; but &s;poke not; then folding up the corp&s;e of the Canary in its wool and cotton &s;hroud, departed with one of tho&s;e looks, that the mo|ment it is &s;een it is felt and under&s;tood; but for which, being too powerful for de&s;cription, no language has yet been provided. On going out he beckoned the mu&s;icians to follow. They did &s;o, &s;triking a few chords that would have graced the funeral of Juliet. The very

<P>IN times of old, lived a man, near a great fore&s;t. He was a keeper of &s;heep, and had (as the &s;tory goes) a numerous family. Some of his children were grown up, and &s;ome were infants. One was rocked in the cradle, and two were lulled upon the lap. The mother was a noted &s;pinner, and when they could hold the wool in their hands, and
<PB N="112" REF="120">
had &s;trength enough to turn round the wheel, &s;he &s;et her daughters to work; while the father took care to find &s;uf|ficient out-door bu&s;ine&s;s for the boys; &s;ome were to tend the herd, and &s;ome that were too weak for hard work, &s;cared the birds from the corn. Now it is reported by the neighbours of the adjacent village, that the old &s;hepherd, the father, was a mighty odd character, and bred up his family in a very differ|ent manner from his poor neighbours. As he was unable to give them the advantage of an education like ours, and teach them Latin and Greek, he was re&s;olved to furni&s;h them with &s;uch accompli&s;hments as his &s;ituation per|mitted. He was a man of tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity, and often &s;poke to his children in this manner: "Do all the
<PB N="113" REF="121">
good you can, boys and girls, and be &s;ure you do no harm. You mu&s;t labour for a livelihood, but you may always get your bread innocently; and the bread that is earned hone&s;tly, will be always the &s;weeter for it. I am my&s;elf obliged to attend a flock; your mother is compelled to &s;pin; to the poor &s;heep we are therefore all in|debted; they afford us food and rai|ment, they &s;hield us from the cold, and prevent us falling into the jaws of famine. I therefore love the harmle&s;s creatures, and would not hurt them for all that they are worth: let this conduct teach you, children, to behave properly to poor dumb animals, and to u&s;e them as they de&s;erve to be u&s;ed. You are <HI>their</HI> friends, and they are <HI>yours.</HI> Prove your&s;elves their protec|tors;
<PB N="114" REF="122">
but I charge you pre&s;ume not to think you have any right of tyranny; and be a&s;&s;ured, <HI>wanton cruelty will always be returned upon the tormentor."</HI> The whole family li&s;tened to the old man's argument, and it would have been well for them if they had always obeyed the precepts of their father. But now comes the cream of the &s;tory, pray therefore attend. The elde&s;t &s;on had one day taken the ne&s;t of a Robin, which con&s;i&s;ted of five young ones, and a &s;ixth ju&s;t bur&s;ting from the &s;hell. He carried them home to his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, to each of which he gave a bird; but the little ne&s;tling he gave to one of the children in the lap, who wrap|ping it up in a piece of flannel, put it into a &s;mall wicker ba&s;ket, and &s;et it by the fire. The boy that found the ne&s;t,
<PB N="115" REF="123">
tied a &s;tring to the leg of his bird, and cruelly dragged it after him. The &s;e|cond &s;on run pins through the eyes of his bird, and took a delight in &s;eeing it bleed to death. The third gave his to the cat, or rather <HI>pretended</HI> to give it, for he held it fir&s;t pretty clo&s;e to pu&s;s's whi&s;kers, and then pulled it away from her, but at la&s;t &s;he pounced upon it, and carried off one of the legs. The elde&s;t daughter intended to have taken care of her's, but one of her brothers having murdered his own, &s;eized upon her property, and both pulling the poor wretch different ways, betwixt com|pa&s;&s;ion and cruelty, it died in the con|te&s;t. And the younger girl, now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only bird that was left, put her's into a cage, and covered it over with wool. At this cri&s;is the mother,
<PB N="116" REF="124">
who had been gleaning, and the poor old &s;hepherd, returned home. The limbs of the dead birds were &s;een upon the floor, and the cat was bu&s;ily em|ployed in a corner, at clearing them away. The old man in&s;i&s;ted upon the truth. The trembling boy confe&s;&s;ed it. "Barbarous wretches! cried the &s;hepherd, is this the return for my care and in&s;truction? But I will puni&s;h you for it." The elde&s;t &s;on he tied by the leg, and did to him as he did to the bird; the &s;econd &s;on he &s;cratched with pins till his hands were all over blood; at the third he &s;et his dog, who caught him by the leg as he u&s;ed to catch the &s;heep; the elde&s;t daughter, who had lo&s;t her bird, he pitied. He ki&s;&s;ed the &s;econd daughter, which had put her poor thing into the cage; but
<PB N="117" REF="125">
<HI>hugged to his very heart</HI> the little crea|ture that had placed the ne&s;tling in a warm ba&s;ket. Now it plea&s;ed God, that about &s;ix or &s;even months after this, the elde&s;t &s;on (which had been the cau&s;e of all this mi&s;chief) fell &s;ick, and died; and many people are now living who &s;ay, that as he was going to be put into the ground, the ravens, rooks, kites, and other va&s;t birds, all flew over his coffin, &s;creamed, and could by no means be got away, nor could he re&s;t in his grave for them; becau&s;e the animals were always digging up the earth under where he lay, as if they were re&s;olved to eat him up&mdash;and &s;ome declare <HI>he is actually gone.</HI> I beg par|don, &s;chool-fellows, for this long &s;tory, but I &s;hall fini&s;h directly.

<P>THE whole life of this poor &s;lave, till within the two la&s;t years, has been a continued trial of &s;trength, la|bour, and patience.

During the very fir&s;t vacation, this &s;prightly youth &s;o completely out|rode the &s;trength of his &s;teed, that he &s;old him, on the &s;ame day that he re|gained his college, at the recommence|ment of the term, for two guineas, to one of tho&s;e per&s;ons who keep livery &s;tables, and at the &s;ame time have hor&s;es to let. It was not ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible for a poor wretch, &s;o badly &s;ituated before, to change &s;o much for the wor&s;e: and of all the fates that attend a hackney hor&s;e, that which belongs to the drudge of a public univer&s;ity is the

mo&s;t &s;evere: it is even harder than that of the &s;ervitors of the college. He remained in this &s;ervitude, however, &s;ixteen years, during which he was a thou&s;and times not only prie&s;t-ridden, but pari&s;h ridden, and yet was rarely known to &s;tumble, and never to fall. Is it not que&s;tionable whether half the pari&s;hioners, or even the prie&s;ts (with reverence be it &s;poken) could &s;ay as much for their <HI>own</HI> travels in the rugged journey of life? His ma&s;ter, rather from policy than compa&s;&s;ion, thought it mo&s;t for his future intere&s;t to allow his four-footed &s;ervant a &s;hort re&s;pite, and he was accordingly favour|ed with a month's run in what is called a &s;alt mar&s;h; but, before his furlow was expired, he was <HI>borrowed</HI> by &s;ome &s;mugglers, who then infe&s;ted the coa&s;t,
<PB N="122" REF="130">
and who made him the receiver of con|traband commodities, as well as aider and abettor in practices, which, like many other underhand actions, are be&s;t carried on in the night time. We &s;ay <HI>borrowed,</HI> becau&s;e after a winter's hard work in the company of the&s;e land-pirates, the hor&s;e was thrown up by his temporary employers in the very mar&s;h out of which he had been pre&s;&s;ed into their &s;ervice, and a lea|thern label, on which was marked this facetious intelligence, fa&s;tened to his fetlock&mdash;<HI>Owner, I have been &s;muggled.</HI> By the&s;e means he unexpectedly came again into his quondam ma&s;ter's po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, out of which, however, he de|parted, the &s;ummer after, in the &s;ociety of an old fellow commoner, who, after many years clo&s;e confinement in the

cloi&s;ters, was di&s;po&s;ed to relinqui&s;h them in favour of a piece of church preferment in Norfolk, which hap|pened to be in the gift of a lady about his own &s;tanding in life, and who, in the days of her youth, avowed &s;o &s;trong a partiality for this gentleman, that her father, di&s;approving her alliance with a per&s;on who had only the hopes of a curacy before his eyes, thought fit to clog her inheritance, over which he had complete authority, with a formid|able condition of forfeiting the whole e&s;tates, &s;hould &s;he marry a &s;on of the church: &s;hutting out, hereby, the whole body of divinity, to exclude the afore|&s;aid individual member. Faithful, how|ever, to the merits of the man who had won her heart, &s;he was glad to find that the parental tyranny which had tied her
<PB N="124" REF="132">
hand, had left free her fortune: &s;he, therefore, took the fir&s;t opportunity to pre&s;ent the object of her early choice with the only piece of &s;ervice in her power &mdash; a pre&s;entation to the living of which &s;he was become the patro|ne&s;s, thinking this a better evidence of her &s;till exi&s;ting partiality, than if &s;he had &s;et fortune at defiance, and &s;acrificed not only her own advantages but her lover's, to gratifying a pa&s;&s;ion which would have impoveri&s;hed both. An example of tenderne&s;s, this, well worthy the imitation of more romantic minds. It was to be inducted to this living our learned clerk now journeyed on the ancient &s;teed who&s;e memoirs I am now writings and as he did not intend to revi&s;it the banks of the I&s;is, and had often been &s;ecurely carried to a

But the turbulent part of this poor brute's adventures was not yet performed. His patron died without him&s;elf deriv|ing what might have been expected from his benefice; and &s;oon after the decea&s;e of the ma&s;ter, the &s;ervant fell into the hands of a man in the &s;ame pari&s;h, who, to a variety of other en|deavours to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a large and needy family, added that of letting out occa|&s;ionally a hor&s;e. Our hero, &s;till un|broken in either knees or con&s;titution, was deemed fit for his purpo&s;e, and being thought of little value, was ob|tained at an ea&s;y price. His new ma&s;ter removed &s;oon after to Lowe&s;toft,
<PB N="126" REF="134">
which you know is a con&s;iderable &s;ea-bathing town by the &s;ea-&s;ide, in the county of Suffolk, where the toils im|po&s;ed by his Oxford tyrant were more than accumulated; for, be&s;ides drag|ging a cart all the morning with loads of bread (a baker being among&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of his ma&s;ter,) he was, on account of his gentle di&s;po&s;ition, the Hor&s;e fixed upon to take a couple of gouty invalids in the bathing machine, after the more vigorous divers and dippers had fini&s;hed their ablutions.

The owner him&s;elf, con|fe&s;&s;ed he was almo&s;t done up, at which thought a long &s;igh en&s;ued, and a con|fe&s;&s;ion that he had been the chief &s;up|port of the family, ob&s;erving, while he

<P>Pre-determined as I &s;aid to &s;pare the remains of this poor wretch, I bought

him on the &s;pot, convinced that it would be difficult to find any other per&s;on who would receive him on any terms.

The a&s;&s;ocia|tion would have di&s;graced that cele|brated &s;pectre; nor did Quixote him|&s;elf exhibit &s;o woeful a countenance. If ever, therefore, I could boa&s;t of an action purely di&s;intere&s;ted, and which had unalloyed compa&s;&s;ion for its ba&s;is, it was the giving five times more than he was worth, that is to &s;ay, five guineas, for this old hor&s;e; intending only, at the time, that he &s;hould pa&s;s the re&s;idue of his days in peaceful in|dolence, broke in upon by the infirmi|ties of life, and die a natural death.
<PB N="130" REF="138">
To this end I obtained him the run of a friend's park, where I con&s;idered him as a re&s;pectable veteran retired on a pen&s;ion. In this verdant ho&s;pital he remained, un&s;ought, un&s;een, a whole year; at the end of which, being invited to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas with the noble and generous owners of the park afore&s;aid, I paid a vi&s;it al&s;o to my pen|&s;ioner, who had grown &s;o much beyond him&s;elf on their unmea&s;ured bounty, that he &s;eemed to be renovated. Do not wonder that I &s;carce knew him in his improvements, for he appeared not to know him&s;elf. The poor fellow's very character was inverted; the al|teration reached from head to heel: he neighed, &s;norted, kicked, and fro|licked about the pa&s;ture, on my fir&s;t attempt to &s;top him, with the airs of a
<PB N="131" REF="139">
&s;illy-foal. I reminded him that he ought to deport more humbly, con&s;i|dering the melancholy &s;ituation from which he was but recently delivered; yet, &s;o far from paying any attention, he turned from my morality with another &s;nort of di&s;dain, to&s;&s;ed up his &s;aucy head, and threw up his heels, wholly forgetting, like other ingrates, his form|er condition. Like them too, he ap|peared to con&s;ider the world now made for him; and, therefore, betwixt je&s;t and earne&s;t, I was re&s;olved once more to &s;hew him he was made for the world.</P>
<P>The very next day I cau&s;ed him to be taken from his green rece&s;s, and performed the tour of the environs on his back. More airily, more plea&s;antly,

I could not have been carried, nor, to|wards the end of the ride, more &s;ober|ly. The &s;pirit which he &s;hewed in the pa&s;ture was but as the levities of a hearty and happy old age in the pleni|tude of uncurbed lei&s;ure; like the gaiety of a veteran, who, finding him|&s;elf in health, might take it into his head to fini&s;h in a country dance; but the&s;e are &s;allies for a moment.

</FIGURE> THE OX AND THE LAMB.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a mile from the we&s;tern-gate of the town of Cleves, a traveller perceived a man and boy bu&s;ied in doing &s;omething; to the mo&s;t beautiful Ox he ever beheld: as he came nearer, he found they were adorn|ing it with a great variety of fanciful ornaments; a large collar of yew branches, tied with ribbon, and wreath|ed with other ever-greens, was thrown
<PB N="141" REF="149">
over its neck: papers, on which were drawn herds, flocks, and &s;hepherds, and folded into large beau-knots, were fixed, it is to be feared <HI>pinned</HI> with large corkers, to its &s;kin, in various parts of the body: bunches of the &s;ame were tied to the tail, braided into the mane, and the brows were hung with a garland of holly, of which there was a twi&s;t, fa&s;tened by a red filleting, even to the horns, the tips of which were &s;tuck with little May-bu&s;hes in bloom. His attention was pre&s;ently called from this, by the bleat of a Sheep and its Lamb: tho&s;e creatures were bound to an he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge in a corner of the &s;ame en|clo&s;ure. They were dre&s;&s;ed nearly in the ta&s;te of the Ox, with this variation in the Lamb, a collar of early opening flowers of the field, and &s;ome twigs of
<PB N="142" REF="150">
hawthorn in bud, and which, betwixt &s;port and earne&s;t, it was trying to get into its mouth. On a&s;king the cau&s;e of all this finery, he was told it was upon account of its being a <HI>jour-de-f&eacute;te,</HI> and al&s;o the day before that of the greate&s;t beef, mutton, and lamb market in the whole year! And pray, friend, &s;aid the traveller, where is the nece&s;&s;ity of dre&s;&s;ing the animals in that manner? 'Tis our cu&s;tom, Sir, replies the man driving the Ox towards the town, and the boy with the Sheep and Lamb, now unbound, following his example. The traveller had not time for more interrogatories, being wholly taken up with the anticks of the Lamb, which frolicking &s;ometimes with its mother, and &s;ometimes with the boy, and &s;ome|times even with its own &s;hadow,
<PB N="143" REF="151">
brought &s;o clo&s;e under his eye, and &s;o near indeed to his very heart, the fine lines of Mr. Pope, that he re|peated them over and over. Every image of this de&s;cription had its im|mediate illu&s;tration in the object before him:
<Q><L>The Lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,</L>
<L>Had he thy rea&s;on would he &s;kip and play?</L>
<L>Plea&s;ed to the la&s;t, he crops the flow'ry food,</L>
<L>And licks the hand ju&s;t rais'd to &s;hed his blood!</L></Q></P>
<P>They gained Cleves as the traveller pronounced, for the tenth time, that impre&s;&s;ive ver&s;e, which gives the moral in the following line&mdash;
<Q>O blindne&s;s to the future! <HI>KINDLY</HI> given.</Q></P>
<P>The animals were led, or rather driven, through the principal &s;treets,
<PB N="144" REF="152">
literally for <HI>&s;hew,</HI> it being the practice of WESTPHALIA for the butchers to exhibit their meat <HI>alive</HI> the day pre|ceding the &s;laughter. "I pretend," &s;ays our traveller, "to que&s;tion neither the u&s;e nor the nece&s;&s;ity of all this; nor by any means to &s;tretch pity or feeling beyond its bounds. I only ob&s;erve, that my affections followed the&s;e crea|tures in their <HI>funeral</HI> proce&s;&s;ion through the town of CLEVES, and could not leave them till on turning a narrow lane I &s;aw, with a kind of emotion ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed, the door of the place de&s;tined for their de&s;truction; it being a practice in this country to &s;laughter their meat, and a very filthy one it is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame vile cu&s;tom prevails in many parts of HOLLAND.</NOTE>, in the open &s;treet; the pavements and
<PB N="145" REF="153">
kennels of which are &s;tained, running with blood. I will carry you no fur|ther into this little adventure than ju&s;t to note, that being the next day obliged to pa&s;s the end of the &s;treet, where I took leave of my poor dumb compa|nions, I ob&s;erved not only &s;everal parts of them hung upon hooks at the butcher's &s;hop, but &s;everal of the or|naments. Even the flowers that were wreathed about the face of the Lamb were now crowded into its mouth, and &s;potted with its harmle&s;s blood. "Poor little fellow," &s;aid the traveller, "thou wert ye&s;terday the merrie&s;t of the fri&s;k|ing tribe! Would I had never met thee! If in the cour&s;e of the week, it was my lot to <HI>eat</HI> any part of the&s;e animals at the tables where I then vi&s;ited, as was mo&s;t probably the ca&s;e, con&s;ider <HI>poor
<PB N="146" REF="154">
human nature,</HI> and forgive me! I am not prepo&s;terous enough to advi&s;e a being, who is made up of appetites to ab&s;tain from the gratification of &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;tence, but while we yield to the &s;tern laws of our mor|tality, let us not &s;purn all &s;ort of feel|ing, like the man, who, on &s;eeing &s;ome lambs at &s;port in a meadow, exclaimed, "Ah, ye dear innocent, beautiful crea|tures, would to heaven I had a joint of ye to-day for dinner, with nice &s;pinnage and butter!" A very different &s;enti|ment &s;prung up in the mind of the &s;pectator of this &s;cene as he &s;urveyed the amputated limbs of the&s;e his late a&s;&s;ociates, and he could not but remem|ber what the heart-melting Otway &s;ays on the &s;ubject:
<Q><PB N="147" REF="155">
<L>Lead, lead me like a tame Lamb to &s;acrifice,</L>
<L>Thus in his fatal garlands deck'd, fine and pleas'd,</L>
<L>The wanton &s;kips and plays&mdash;</L>
<L>Trots by th' inticing, flattering, prie&s;te&s;s' &s;ide,</L>
<L>And much tran&s;ported with his little pride,</L>
<L>Forgets his dear companions of the plain,</L>
<L>Till, by her bound, he's on the altar lain,</L>
<L>And then, too, hardly bleats.</L></Q>
Never can this affecting pa&s;&s;age be more touchingly illu&s;trated than in the ca&s;e of the Lamb of WESTPHALIA.</P>
