<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to return you my un|feigned thanks for your kind reception of this <HI>Tragedy</HI> on the &s;tage, and to reque&s;t the continuance of your favour to it in the clo&s;et. It would be the highe&s;t ingratitude in me to forget the only patron I ever had the good fortune to meet with, by who&s;e powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have been enabled to defeat the combined forces of envy, malice and detraction. I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time fairly confe&s;s, my victory over the enemy was owing, I believe, as many other victories have been, more to the art and prowe&s;s of my <HI>Officers</HI> than to any extraordinary merit of my own. To the fir&s;t in command, Mi&s;s YOUNGE, I have infinite obligations, which I &s;hall always gratefully acknowledge, tho' I may never have it in my power to repay them; nor can the &s;kill and conduct of my generals, REDDISH, SMITH and PALMER, be &s;ufficiently admired. To your patronage and protection I mo&s;t heartily and &s;incerely recommend them: If I have been the happy in&s;trument of giving them a favourable op|portunity of ri&s;ing in <HI>your</HI> e&s;teem, it will give me the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction. <HI>You</HI> can be&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h their merit, and <HI>you</HI> alone are able to reward it.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your much obliged, And devoted humble Servant, The Author.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
