<P>TRUE GLORY GUIDES NO ECHOING CAR&mdash;as is now exemplified in the noi&s;ele&s;s tenour of the way long pur&s;ued, in his going about doing good, by the mo&s;t truly glorious of mortal beings. When I give him this title, I flatter my&s;elf that but few of your readers will want to be informed, that I mean the <HI>Con&s;ummate Philanthropi&s;t,</HI> who who has &s;o fully and feelingly demon&s;trated, that indeed nothing hu|man is alien from him, by having given him&s;elf up to the &s;oftening the &s;orrows and &s;ufferings of &s;ome of the mo&s;t unworthy, as well as of the mo&s;t unfortunate of our race, in that to the horrors of a pri&s;on, where the iron &s;o often enters into the &s;oul, horrors &s;hould not be added. Urged by &s;trong benevolence of &s;oul from his plea&s;ant home, and his more plea&s;ant friends, who, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, do honour him but ju&s;t on this &s;ide idolatry, he is now, in&s;tead of rattling in a tri|umphal car, gliding tranquilly on the &s;ea, apparently but an ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;enger, amid&s;t all the wants of ea&s;e and accommodation, at about 60 years of age, in a common ve&s;&s;el, to dare the vile contagion of the Turks, and, if he cannot purge their air of pe&s;tilence, to try at lea&s;t to correct its virulence, retard its progre&s;s, and be ble&s;&s;ed by thou&s;ands &s;aved from untimely death. In the only hour that I had ever the happine&s;s and the honour of his conver&s;ation, two months ago in Italy,
<PB N="20" REF="18">I did all but wor&s;hip him. He was then at Rome, which for once &s;aw, but knew him not, a true vicar of the God of Mercy, by whom the man that, when his fellow-creature was in pri&s;on came unto him, and performed other acts of charity, &s;hall be placed on the right-hand of his throne; and was going to vi&s;it the lazarettos at Naples and at Mal|ta, and thence to Con&s;tantinople. He will be ab&s;ent &s;omewhat above a year. He cheri&s;hes a hope, that the means he has di&s;covered to check the influence of the jail infection will be efficacious likewi&s;e again&s;t the plague; and, to make the trial, abandons his comforts, and ri&s;ks his life. Glorious man! God-fulfil his hope, and &s;end him &s;a&s;e back, to be &s;till an ornament to human nature in general, and, in porticular, to this glorious country which produced him, and which an accompli&s;hed daughter of it has lately told us &s;he has the daily delight to hear applanded in others as eminently ju&s;t, generous, and humane! I plea&s;e my&s;elf with thinking what a ho&s;t will join me in the wi&s;h. But &s;hall we be content with giving him but empty words, and not avail our&s;elves of the only opportunity, which in all proba|bility we can ever have till he re&s;t from his god-like labours, of doing our&s;elves honour, in doing, to &s;peak humanly, a &s;olid and a &s;olemn one to him? Suppo&s;e, Mr. Urban, you were to erect a &s;tatue to him? Entertaining as great an opinion of the glorious po&s;&s;ibilities of the Engli&s;h character, as Lord Chatham could do of tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, I per&s;uade my&s;elf that you would be quickly fur|ni&s;hed with the means, in only calling, by the publication of the hint in your next Magazine but for a &s;ingle guinea (though the opulent need not be &s;tinted) upon tho&s;e of the ju&s;t, generous, and humane, among&s;t us, who can ea&s;ily afford them&s;elves the plea&s;ure of giving a te&s;timony to their exalted &s;en&s;e of what our nature owes to Mr. HOWARD. How truly has he ennobled the name! Before this glo|rious man aro&s;e, what has been ever done for mankind by <HI>all the
<PB N="21" REF="19">blood of all the Howards?</HI> Ye little &s;tars, hide your dimini&s;hed rays! More I think will be furni&s;hed than is requi&s;ite to erect a &s;tatue; the overplus will go almo&s;t &s;elf-directed to the jails. A bu&s;t, or picture of him, for a &s;culptor to work from, can, without doubt, be &s;upplied by &s;ome friend. You and your corre&s;ondents will think of the pro|per &s;pot in which the &s;tatue &s;hould be placed, and of the in&s;cription for it. But no time is to be lo&s;t; for, if it be not executed before his return, Mr. Howard's humble &s;en&s;e of his own inerits would mo&s;t cer|tainly prevent it. Alas, alas, Mr. Urban, what are po&s;thumous ho|nours! No! <HI>prae&s;enti illi.</HI>&mdash;In&s;luenced only by our admiration and our love of &s;uch virtue as we mu&s;t confe&s;s hath never yet ari&s;en but in Mr. Howard, let us render it mature honours whil&s;t it is yet pre&s;ent with us in this world, as the be&s;t foundation for not de&s;pairing that equal virtue may yet ari&s;e.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ANGLUS.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. Your wonder perhaps, Mr. Urban, and I am &s;ure your in|dignation, will be excited, when you are informed that, in a country pretending mode&s;tly to be the mo&s;t highly civilized, and in this age, when &s;o much more light than heretofore, and, one would hope, con|&s;equent goodne&s;s, are diffu&s;ed, &s;ome of the ruling powers of that country could harbour the thought of &s;eizing upon Mr. Howard in his pa&s;&s;age through it, for having, in the hope they might be re|formed, made abu&s;es known, in a book publi&s;hed in another country and another language. That he was not &s;eized, is undoubtedly owing to the light which is diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P>When I a&s;ked Mr. Howard, with what anti&s;eptic he arms him&s;elf when he ventures into tho&s;e man&s;ions of mi&s;ery and infection, which, for the &s;ake of his fellow-creatures, he has long frequented, and is now again &s;eeking in a di&s;tant land; he told me, that he tru&s;ts, under God, to extreme <HI>cleanline&s;s</HI> alone; of the property of which to re|&s;i&s;t, or rather afford no hold to, infection, he entertains a great, and,
<PB N="22" REF="20">from experience, ju&s;t idea. An additional recommendation this to the decency and the comfort of that charming quality, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, virtue, the concomitant of civili&s;ation. That the mo&s;t uncivili&s;ed people are the mo&s;t dirty, will not, I believe, be controverted; and, if the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition be equally true, let it not be for|gotten by the travellers in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>&dtristar;Having the &s;ame opinion with our corre&s;pondent of "this Con&s;ummate Philanthropi&s;t," and of "the glorious po&s;&s;ibility of the Engli&s;h character;" our printer (Mr. Nichols, in Red-Lion Pa&s;&s;age, Flect-&s;treet) has undertaken to receive &s;ub&s;criptions for this purpo&s;e till the end of June; before which period &s;ome re&s;pectable bankers will be reque&s;ted to a&s;&s;i&s;t this laudable propo&s;al.

<P>TO evince my approbation of erecting a MONUMENT to commemo|rate the godlike actions of the <HI>living</HI> HOWARD, I inclo&s;e a draught for ten guineas, to be appropriated to that DESIGN.</P>
<P>Per&s;naded as I am, that his character and writings will &s;urvive the mo&s;t durable monument of friend&s;hip; yet &s;uch an example of appro|bation appears to me calculated to promote many beneficial purpo&s;es, though it cannot augment the zeal of this amiable man in the pur&s;uit of le&s;&s;ening human mi&s;ery. Public approbation of private and publick virtues, whil&s;t it acknowledges a debt due to intrin&s;ic merit, reflects the highe&s;t honour on the community; for to reward virtue is a plea&s;|ing proof of its prevalence; and that it does prevail, the MONUMENT of HOWARD will te&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21">Virtue, whether &s;hining in the public walks of life, or emitting the &s;oft rays of human benevolence in the dungeous of mi&s;ery, will ever obtain its own internal reward beyond all the powers of &s;culpture; but to exhibit that evidence to the public, to excite emulation in vir|tuous pur&s;uits, and to induce &s;pectators to go and do &s;o likewi&s;e, nothing &s;eems more conducive than a MONUMENT to HOWARD.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent moment, during his ab&s;ence in TURKEY, is the mo&s;t proper to accompli&s;h &s;uch a DESIGN. With goodne&s;s of heart he unites exemplary humility; and a perfection of mind, rarely equalled, is veiled by a mode&s;ty that &s;huns prai&s;e and adulation; but the public applau&s;e which is due to great and virtuous actions cannot be ungrate&s;ul to the god-like brea&s;t of HOWARD.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e therefore the fir&s;t FIVE per&s;ons who &s;ub&s;cribe TEN GUINEAS each, or upwards, be appointed a <HI>committee</HI> to carry &s;uch a DESIGN into execution; which <HI>committee</HI> may be afterwards augmented, by &s;e|lecting from the &s;ub&s;eribers at large &s;uch per&s;ons who&s;e ta&s;te and abilities may further a&s;&s;i&s;t in <HI>de&s;igning</HI> a MONUMENT to HOWARD.</P>

<P>OF the propo&s;al, &s;ugge&s;ted by your ingenious and benevolent Cor|re&s;pondent ANGLUS, to erect a &s;tatue in honour of Mr. Howard, I mo&s;t cordially approve; and where is to be found a man of &s;en&s;e and virtue that will not &s;ay the &s;ame? State&s;men are the corruption, and heroes the de&s;troyers, of the human &s;pecies; but Mr. Howard is, in the noble&s;t and mo&s;t unequivocal &s;en&s;e of the word, their pre&s;erver. I can my&s;elf feel the importance of his &s;ervices more than the generality of his readers, as, from motives not quite di&s;&s;imilar from his own, I have been long accu&s;tomed to vi&s;it pri&s;ons, and perform, now and then, tho&s;e offices of charity which are too much neglected even by wi&s;e and good men, and which, if I had not been writing on a &s;ubject endeared to me by long and &s;olemn reflexion, I &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to mention con|cerning my&s;elf.&mdash;Anglus &s;eems to call upon your readers in general, not merely for approbation, but a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In what manner then does he mean me to a&s;&s;i&s;t? for it is a righteous cau&s;e, and my heart is with it. On Mr. Howard him&s;elf it were a panegyric to expatiate in that language which truth it&s;elf would warrant. Argument and per&s;ua&s;ion are anticipated by the general and ju&s;t celebrity he has attained; and it &s;eems to me, that merely to propo&s;e the &s;tatue is &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the concurrence of tho&s;e who reverence the character of Mr. Howard: but as to the penurious and the unfeeling, I mu&s;t &s;ay, with a little accommodation of Sallu&s;t, <HI>verba viris</HI> virtuem <HI>non addere.</HI> In the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of things, I can only reque&s;t to be put down as a &s;ub&s;criber, and to be con&s;idered as a mo&s;t &s;incere well-wi&s;her.</P>

His plan is original; and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity. It was a voyage of di&s;covery, a circumnaviga|tion of charity. Already the benefit of his labour is felt, more or le&s;s, in every country: I hope he will anticipate his final reward, by &s;eeing all its effects fully realized in his own. He will receive, not by retail, but in gro&s;s, the reward of tho&s;e who vi&s;it the pri&s;oner; and he has &s;o fore&s;talled and monopolized this branch of charity, that there will be, I tru&s;t, little room to merit by &s;uch acts of benevolence here|after.</P>

<P>AS I was charmed with the idea of erecting a &s;tatue to Mr. Howard, I beg your acceptance of my mite towards &s;o good a work; and this &s;entimental offering &s;hould have been larger, were it not for the ex|pence of &s;ome living &s;tatues, which I am at this time rai&s;ing to my&s;elf. A plan &s;o truly national meets my ideas in every point of view; but its <HI>grand</HI> effect I hope and tru&s;t will be, that, by this pointed di&s;tinc|tion, a door may be opened for the revival of good &s;en&s;e, and for the re&s;toration of that honour to virtue, which has &s;o long been engro&s;&s;ed by every thing that is oppo&s;ite to it.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy truth, Mr. Urban, that, for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years, the epithets of <HI>famous, celebrated,</HI> &amp;c. have &s;carcely ever been applied, except to per&s;ons an&s;wering to &s;ome of the following de&s;crip|tions; viz. Fir&s;t, rebels; &s;econdly, &s;trumpets; thirdly, rogues, high|waymen, &amp;c.; fourthly, Athei&s;tical or Dei&s;tical writers. The&s;e, I &s;ay, have for &s;ome time been the <HI>ton;</HI> but I flatter my&s;elf, that the immortal honours, intended to be conferred on our great philanthropi&s;t, may be a means to prevent the vicious from a&s;&s;uming tho&s;e titles which they and their dupes have been &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towing on each other, May we not, I &s;ay, indulge a plea&s;ing expectation, that this, through God's good providence, may become an epoch in the moral hi&s;tory of mankind; and that, under &s;uch au&s;pices, the public man may henceforth become what he always ought to have been, &mdash;uni aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis?&mdash; in con&s;equence of which pious hope, I rejoice and exult in the oppor|tunity of contributing my humble &s;anction and &s;upport to the bu&s;ine&s;s you have in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">Be&s;ides this, I think the Briti&s;h nation is very properly con&s;ulting its own, honour, by perpetuating that of Mr. Howard. This is now the <HI>third</HI> time that England has produced a Worthy of &s;uch eminence as to be not only <HI>unrival'd,</HI> but even, I think we may add, <HI>inimitable</HI>&mdash;it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e I refer to the names of SHAKSPEARE, NEWTON, and HOWARD.

<P>FROM the rapid progre&s;s of the &s;ub&s;cription, in which are already many names great in goodne&s;s, learning, elegance, and &s;en&s;ibility, as well as rank, I cannot doubt but that you will &s;oon &s;ee it filled in a manner becoming a de&s;ign formed to enkindle all the &s;parks of nature in every lover of virtue and his &s;pecies, and becoming, what I have the plea&s;ure to believe I may truly call, the mo&s;t virtuous, and, in its individuals, the mo&s;t opulent nation under Heaven. But when you have the means, how is this de&s;ign to be completed, and where (is one of the fir&s;t que&s;tions naturally a&s;ked) is the Statue to be placed? You are plea&s;ed to invite the corre&s;pondence of any friend to the de&s;ign. I am a warm one to it; and to expre&s;s how warm a one, I cannot do better than adopt the words of a great Ornament of our country in his letter in the la&s;t Gentleman's Magazine <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 25.</NOTE>, and &s;ay with him, I feel that "It is a righteou cau&s;e, and my heart is with it." In con&s;equence of your invitation, therefore, having contributed my mite of money, I beg leave to contribute my mite of &s;ugge&s;tion al&s;o, in regard chie&s;ly to a &s;pot in which to place the Statue, with the mo&s;t general approba|tion: I &s;ay the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> general approbation, well knowing that, if he &s;hed not a miraculous influence on their minds, Michael the Archangel could no more think of a &s;pot to place it in, than a Michael Angelo,
<PB N="34" REF="32">or even a Phidias or Praxiteles, could &s;culpture it, &s;o as to plea&s;e every critic. And how is that mo&s;t general approbation to be con&s;ulted and collected, but by early throwing out ideas to the public, in the hope to provoke good judgements to amend them, or rather furni&s;h more acceptable ideas in their &s;tead?</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e then, what at pre&s;ent there &s;eems to be a happy pro&s;pect of, that the general re&s;timony, from &s;uch a nation as this, to the virtues of our unparalleled prodigy of a philanthropi&s;t, will bring in &s;o magnificent a &s;ub&s;cription as to enable you to erect his Statue on a column, of the Corinthian order, fluted, and of the dimen&s;ions at lea&s;t of that beautiful one dug out of the ruins of the Temple of Peace, on which Pope Borghe&s;e, Paul the Fifth, erected a Statue, which is now &s;tanding at Rome, in front of the church of St. Maria Maggiore. I will &s;uppo&s;e, further that there will be left an overplus, not only competent to the excellent idea of one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable charac|ters in the world, a gentleman of Suffolk, of placing a bu&s;t of Mr. Howard in pri&s;ons, and hou&s;es of indu&s;try and correction, but like|wi&s;e to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a con&s;iderable fund, to be called the <HI>How-ardian fund,</HI> placed in the public &s;tocks, and there to accumulate (I hope for a long while) till Mr. Howard's death; and <HI>then</HI> the intere&s;t of it to be applied, by the <HI>Howardian committee,</HI> whoever they &s;hall be, and however &s;upplied as the members of it drop off (by acts of Par|liament) either in aid of Mr. Howard's reform of pri&s;ons, or in that of the benevolent in&s;titution for the di&s;charge of pri&s;oners confined for &s;mall debts. This will be a collateral method of perpetuating his name, as efficacious as the principal one; as it mu&s;t endure as long as the nation has either &s;tocks or name. But more of this hereafter. I return to the placing of the &s;tatued column.</P>
<P>Now I take it for granted that the &s;pot of all others that ought to be preferred would be that, if it could be found, which would natu|rally
<PB N="35" REF="33">and nece&s;&s;arily induce the public to the daily, con&s;tant, common, and perpetual mention of <HI>Howard's Column;</HI> and by &s;uch means, in|deed, <HI>&s;emper honos nomenque &s;uum laude&s;que manebunt,</HI> which is what you aim at, as well in the mouths of the million, where they otherwi&s;e would &s;oon be lo&s;t, as in philanthropic hearts, where they will for ever live.

Now, if in the place of that Obeli&s;k (which has not long exi&s;ted nei|ther) were &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> will not the name of it, in all &s;imilar phra&s;es, be &s;ub&s;tituted too&mdash;You go by <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.? To this, helps might be given by Road-acts, &amp;c. That the Obelisk would not be very readily given up, it would be injurious to the liberal magi&s;trates of Surrey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Writer of this letter, we believe the Obeli&s;k to be the property of the Corporation of London. But from that opulent and benevolent Body, as well as from the Magi&s;trates of Surrey, every &s;pecies of a&s;&s;i&s;tance may of cour&s;e be expected.</NOTE> to entertain a doubt; as they would in&s;tantly &s;ee that the purpo&s;es for which it was erected, for orna|menting and lighting the &s;pot, and as a term of mea&s;urement, would be not only pre&s;erved, but augmented and improved. <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> &s;uch as I can conceive it, and &s;omething like it I doubt not I &s;hall have the happine&s;s to &s;ee, there or el&s;ewhere, would be much more highly ornamental than the Obelisk: eight &s;quare pillars, dividing the iron rails into as many compartments, might &s;urround the Co|lumn, and have in&s;cribed on their outer &s;ides as many mea&s;urements as you will; and from the tops of the pillars branch out an iron work, &s;upporting each two lamps, and forming in all a ring, or <HI>gloriole,</HI> of &s;ixteen lamps, with which the &s;hrine of that god-like man, &s;o much
<PB N="36" REF="34">more de&s;erving it than any Saint, I beg to be under&s;tood as meaning any <HI>modern</HI> Saint, would be nightly lighted <HI>in &s;aecula &s;eculorum, Amen.</HI> &mdash;The trifling extra-expence of oil, as well as the repairs of the Co|lumn for ever, to be defrayed out of the <HI>Howardian fund.</HI> This &s;pot is what the French call an <HI>etcile.</HI> When thus enriched, what a bril|liant &s;tar! And who knows what glorious con&s;equences to our country its animating influence may produce!</P>
<P>Every Foreigner of Di&s;tinction enters the town' by We&s;tmin&s;ter Bridge, the pa&s;&s;age to which from the Kenti&s;h road is now by the Obelisk, as having been found &s;ome yards nearer than the former way; and, it <HI>Howard's Column</HI> &s;hould occupy the &s;pot, what Foreigner could pa&s;s it, by day or by night, without acquainting him&s;elf with the meaning of it, and con&s;equently with the character of the man to who&s;e honour it was erected? His character indeed is well known; and, when I &s;ay that, I &s;ay <HI>admired,</HI> and, I may add, <HI>envied to us,</HI> by all the pre&s;ent &s;et of men in Europe, from the <HI>Sovereigns</HI> down to their lowe&s;t fubjects, who know any thing of the world&mdash;with whom, by the way, this nation will lo&s;e no credit by the magnificent exulta|tion which it will expre&s;s in this Monument of gratitude, for having had the honour to produce him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be much &s;urprized, Gentlemen, if you &s;hould not receive, before the end of September, a &s;ub&s;cription more than competent to, all the purpo&s;es of honouring Mr. Howard than have been here &s;ug|ge&s;ted, if they &s;hould be approved; which I am far from pre&s;uming to flatter my&s;elf they will, as I expect to &s;ee much more judicious &s;chemes propo&s;ed; but &s;o very material an article, as that of the &s;pot where the Statue &s;hould be placed, cannot too &s;oon be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Should you think it worthy, you may publi&s;h my letter if you plea&s;e, as it may &s;erve at lea&s;t to &s;harpen better wits, perhaps at my expence, how much &s;oever it may be it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are, I &s;earce can think it, but am told&mdash;Yes, Sir, there are, they &s;ay, &s;ome gentlemen who, upon the &s;ubject of the excellent national de&s;ign which is now on foot, object to the propriety, not of rendering a public honour to Mr. Howard in his life-time, for to that, I believe, no mortal can object, but to the propriety of rendering that public honour in a <HI>Statue;</HI> Statues, they &s;ay, relating to the pomp of &s;ucce&s;s in war, and the havock of mankind. But I beg the&s;e gentlemens' pardon. Statues have in all ages been erected like|wi&s;e, at the public expence, to men eminent in the arts of peace as well as war, for virtue, learning, and &s;ervices performed. Augu&s;tus cau&s;ed the Statues of all tho&s;e Romans, who had eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the arts of either peace or war, to be &s;et up in the Curia, allotting to each profe&s;&s;ion its proper place. Thus Tacitus tells us, that the Statue of Horten&s;ius was placed among the orators. Cato Cen&s;or had a Statue for being the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;enator&mdash;the quality of &s;enator is nothing to the purpo&s;e, as a citizen may be as u&s;eful, though he cannot be quite &s;o mi&s;chievous out of the &s;enate as in it&mdash;Lucius Minucius Augurinus, for having re&s;tored plenty to the city&mdash;and Marius Gratidianus for having only taught the marks by which adulterate coins was to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. Here then were Statues erected to <HI>Utility,</HI> but not joined, as in Mr. How|ard's ca&s;e, with the mo&s;t tran&s;cendent philanthropy; for Cato Cen|&s;or, I think it was, who, with a heart harder than the nether mill-&s;tone, had the practice (imitated, I doubt not, as he was fa|mous for his <HI>wi&s;e</HI> oeconomy, by many of tho&s;e barbarous butchers of mankind) of &s;ending his &s;laves, u&s;ele&s;s through age, to be &s;tarved to death upon a barren i&s;land. How happier for them to have been Mr.

And if any one will ca&s;t his eye upon the names which <HI>flumi|nis ritu feruntur,</HI> in their re&s;pective channels, on Prie&s;tley's inge|nious biographical chart which now hangs before me, he will be convinced of the melancholy rea&s;on; as he will there behold tho&s;e cor|rupters and de&s;troyers under the title of &s;tate&s;men and warriors, &s;ailing as it were &s;ecurely along the &s;tream of time, in every age, in large, thick, clo&s;e, well-appointed &s;quadrons, whil&s;t the pre&s;ervers, the friends, and &s;oothers of mankind, <HI>qui vitam excolucre per artes, quique &s;ui memores alios fecere merendo,</HI> appear but here and there one, like the di&s;per&s;ed remnants of the pious Trojan's fleet, thinly &s;cattered, and &s;carce emerging on the &s;urface of the watery wa&s;te. But, thank Hea|ven, from the opening which the labours and writings of Mr. Howard and the progre&s;s of philo&s;ophy together, have given to the eyes and hearts of men, there is great room to hope that the condition of the world is about to mend, and that, convinced as it mu&s;t be, that utility,
<PB N="39" REF="37">accompanied by virtue, has the true&s;t greatne&s;s, we &s;hall &s;ee it readier than it has been to render to virtuous utility its highe&s;t honours.</P>
<P>Of all de&s;criptions of men, it is our judges and magi&s;trates who mu&s;t be the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the utility which Mr. Howard has been of to the world; and I make no doubt, Sir, but that we &s;hall &s;ee the thing will be taken up by Grand Juries, and other public bodies of men, and that the example will run through the kingdom in &s;uch a manner as to make the Statue become voted, with cla&s;&s;ical propriety, to this our mo&s;t <HI>virtuous and u&s;eful</HI> citizen, by his country in his provincial tribes.</P>
<P>But the feeling heart will not want the influence of patriotic wi&s;dom and example to direct it to its own gratification, in delighting to honour delicately, in his ab&s;ence, him by whom our nature is &s;o highly ho|noured, and the precepts of the Divine Teacher, who hath left us an example that we &s;hould do as he did, &s;o well obeyed, that, after going about Europe for thirty years, he is now carried beyond the bounds of it, in the mo&s;t glorious of all cru&s;ades, the &s;ublime ardour of <HI>doing good.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very laudable de&s;ign, which I ob&s;erve by the Gentleman's Magazine has been &s;et on foot greatly, if not chiefly, through you, of handing down to po&s;terity the unexampled philanthropy of Mr. HOW|ARD, meets my &s;incere approbation; and, as I long &s;ince admired his conduct when he was Sheriff of Bedford&s;hire, I beg leave to expre&s;s my attachment to his character, by adding five guineas to the &s;ub&s;crip|tion for erecting a Statue to his unremitted exertions for the relief of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was owing to his ideas, and the intercour&s;e I had with him when Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1771, that I conceived the de&s;ign of con&s;tructing a Gaol, Bridewell, and Debtors-ward in this county.&mdash; It has &s;ince been carried into execution; and, I flatter my&s;elf, the cri|minals, as well as the public, are greatly indebted to him for the re|&s;pective benefits re&s;ulting therefrom. I am, Sir, with great e&s;teem for this opportunity of &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf your very obedient humble &s;er|vant,</P>

<P>AFTER contributing the trifle which accompanies this letter towards the grateful and generous plan of rai&s;ing a memorial to my worthy Re|lation (for &s;uch I have the honour to &s;tyle him) Mr. HOWARD; I beg leave, with great deference to the gentlemen who compo&s;e the Com|mittee, to offer a thought or two on the &s;ubject of their propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Mr. HOWARD appears to me, from my own ob&s;ervation, and from all I have heard of him, to be mode&s;t, and diffident, to an extreme.&mdash; Vanity has no &s;hare in his compo&s;ition.&mdash;His good actions &s;pring from native benevolence alone, without a mixture of a wi&s;h for worldly ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a man, who &s;hrinks from public approbation, will not the &s;howy tribute intended to his merits be exqui&s;itely painful?&mdash;Statues are not very u&s;ually erected, in the&s;e modern times, to any per&s;ons (crowned heads excepted) during their lives, more e&s;pecially when the per&s;on &s;o honoured re&s;ides chiefly near the propo&s;ed &s;ituation of this elegant memorial.&mdash;Should this excellently well-intended Monument give &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s to the per&s;on it commemorates, as to make him avoid the metropolis, which has hitherto been a con&s;picuous &s;cene of his benevolence; would it not then in vain be wi&s;hed that the execution of the plan had been deferred until his ideas on the &s;ubject were at lea&s;t gue&s;&s;ed at?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="40">I will hazard one more que&s;tion.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing that the &s;ums <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> and <HI>to be rai&s;ed</HI> for the Statue were to be employed&mdash;in alleviating the di&s;|tre&s;s of pri&s;oners&mdash;in rewarding and encouraging proper attendants on their &s;ouls and bodies&mdash;in liberating tho&s;e confined for &s;mall debts&mdash; in &s;hort, in following up tho&s;e plans for the welfare of the de&s;titute part of mankind which Mr. HOWARD's life and actions have always meant to inculcate;&mdash;can there be a doubt of the &s;uperior plea&s;ure which that Friend to mankind would feel, when compared with his &s;en&s;ation when he finds, on his return to Britain, an o&s;tentatious token of gra|titude, which can neither extend his fame, or aid the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns?</P>
<P>It will give me &s;incere concern, &s;hould I find that my ideas on this &s;ubject &s;hould give offence to a &s;et of gentlemen &s;o well-intentioned, &s;o liberally-minded, as the Committee to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf.&mdash;Their candour will, I hope, excu&s;e a variation from their opinions, a variation in which I am by no means &s;ingular; &s;ince the &s;ame idea has &s;truck many who have peru&s;ed the papers publi&s;hed on this affair; and among the&s;e are &s;ome who &s;eem to be well acquainted with the &s;entiments of my excellent Relation.

<HEAD><HI>London, Augu&s;t</HI> 28, 1786. STATUE FOR MR. HOWARD, AND HOWARDIAN FUND FOR PRISON-CHARITIES AND REFORMS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY &s;incere Admirers of Mr. HOWARD, "THE FRIEND TO EV'RY CLIME, A PATRIOT OF THE WORLD," anxious that his tran&s;cendent Philanthropy may not wait for the tardy, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, almo&s;t unwilling gratitude, of po&s;thumous acknowledgement from the Public, entertain a Hope, from a Hint thrown out in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for May, and &s;o nobly improved upon in that for June, that (though he &s;eeks not his reward from men) a STATUE, as one of the highe&s;t Earthly Honours, may be erected to him, to perpetuate the Memory of it, before he goes to be rewarded with Heavenly Honours, and during his Ab&s;ence upon a God|like Errand which carries him to Turkey, to try to re&s;train the Ravages of the Plague. And who knows not with how truly Chri&s;tian a Spirit and undaunted Courage he, before, went about doing Good; how gloriou&s;ly he has devoted a great Part of his Life and Property to repeated vi&s;its to mo&s;t of tho&s;e man&s;ions of Mi&s;ery and Infection, the Jails of Europe; and how many a weary Pri&s;oner whom he came unto has been bound to ble&s;s him, for the Removal of at lea&s;t &s;ome Horror, for the Alleviation of at lea&s;t &s;ome Angui&s;h, which with the Iron entered into his Soul, when it was ca&s;t down and di&s;quieted within him! Tho&s;e Per&s;ons therefore who, feeling like Men, Chri&s;tians, and Britons, the exalted Merit which does &s;o much Honour to their Nature, their Religion, and their Country, wi&s;h to avail them&s;elves, that his Delicacy may not be hurt, of the humble Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's Ab&s;ence for the Plea&s;ure of expre&s;&s;ing that Feeling, in the doing &s;omething towards crecting &s;uch a Monument of public Gratitude to <HI>Him,</HI> and of Encouragement to Virtue as heroic and &s;ublime, if it be po&s;|&s;ible, in others, at the &s;ame time forwarding his favourite Charities and Reforms, are hereby invited, by the Committee of the Sub&s;cribers to this National De&s;ign, to &s;end their Contributions to Me&s;&s;rs.
