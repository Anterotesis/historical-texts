<HEAD>PAUL at ATHENS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="19" REF="17">the city wholly given to idolatry: for which rea|&s;on he not only preached in the &s;ynagogue to the Jews and pro&s;elytes; but in other places of con|cour&s;e he took occa&s;ion to make known the Chri&s;tian doctrine to all the heathens he met.</P>
<P>Some learned men of Athens &s;eeing Paul &s;o rea|dy to engage in di&s;pute with every one, undertook
<PB N="20" REF="18">him: but not under&s;tand|ing him, &s;ome cried, he was a prating, babbling fellow; others, that he came to di&s;cover &s;ome &s;trange God to them, be|cau&s;e he frequently men|tioned Je&s;us and the re&s;ur|rection.</P>
<P>After this they brought him before the magi&s;trates, to be examined what new religion it was he taught: for all that they had hi|therto
<PB N="21" REF="19">heard was new and &s;trange, and therefore they de&s;ired to have a full ac|count of all. Paul being at full liberty to &s;peak, &s;aid, &mdash; 'I perceive, O Athenians, that ye have a great number of idols; for as I pa&s;&s;ed by and &s;aw your &s;uper&s;titious devo|tions, I found an altar with this in&s;cription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This GOD therefore,
<PB N="22" REF="20">whom you acknowledge not to know, yet profe&s;s to wor&s;hip, is he whom I preach, the invi&s;ible God of heaven and earth, who cannot be contained in temples of man's making; nor can any image made by man be a proper object of his wor&s;hip; he being &s;o far from wanting our help, that it is he that gives to all their life and all that they have: And from one
<PB N="23" REF="21">man he hath made a whole world of men, appointing times and places in great order. And the end of all this is, that they &s;hould &s;eek after their Creator and wor&s;hip him, who is in|deed near every one of us, even as the Soul that ani|mates us.</P>
<P>For our life, motion, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance are wholly thro' him, according to that which one of your own poets hath &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="22">God therefore being our Creator, we cannot in rea|&s;on &s;uppo&s;e him to be the work of our hands, &s;uch as a piece of gold, &s;ilver, or a &s;tone graved. This time of ignorance hath la&s;ted long; but now God calls you are to repentance, hav|ing determined the way by which all the world &s;hall be judged; that is, by receiving or refu&s;ing the faith of Chri&s;t; who
<PB N="25" REF="23">being rais'd from the dead, is offered to all men to be|lieve in.'</P>
<P>When they heard him mention the re&s;urrection, the Epicureans e&s;pecially, who denied a future &s;tate, fell a laughing at him; others &s;aid, we will hear thee about this another time: and &s;o Paul left them.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="26">as were &s;ick, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils, they were immediately healed: The exorci&s;ts, I &s;ay, &s;eeing this, they al&s;o attempted to ca&s;t out devils by u&s;ing the name of JESUS; among whom were the &s;even &s;ons of one Scaeva a Jew, one of the chief of the families of the prie&s;ts, who adjur|ing the evil &s;pirit in the name of Je&s;us, were thus an&s;wered by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="29" REF="27">'<HI>Je&s;us I know, and Paul I know;</HI> but you come not with any authority from Je&s;us, who hath given it to Paul.'</P>
<P>And the man who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed fell furiou&s;ly up|on them, and was too hard for them; tearing off their clothes, and wounding them, &s;o that they were glad to &s;ly from him.</P>
<P>This being &s;oon rumour|ed among the Jews and
<PB N="30" REF="28">natives of Ephe&s;us, pre|vailed &s;o with them, that they were convinced, and converted to the faith.</P>
<P>And they that were &s;o happy came to Paul and his company, confe&s;&s;ing their former cour&s;e of life, to know what they &s;hould do: And many that had &s;tudied and practi&s;ed ma|gick, brought their books out, and burnt them pub|lickly, tho' they were of
<PB N="31" REF="29">a very high price. Of &s;o great authority was the word of God, as it was preached by Paul among the Ephe&s;ians and tho&s;e of A&s;ia.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> King Agrippa almo&s;t per|&s;uaded to be a Chri&s;tian.</HEAD>
<P>PAUL having been brought before king Agrippa to an&s;wer to di|vers complaints made a|gain&s;t him by the Jews in general, as a mo&s;t notori|ous malefactor; and after Fe&s;tus, a noble orator, had open'd his ca&s;e in an ele|gant
<PB N="34" REF="32">&s;peech before the court; Agrippa told Paul he had liberty to &s;peak: who de&s;iring &s;ilence of the audience, began with this apology for him&s;elf:</P>
<P>'I cannot but think my &s;elf happy, O king Agrip|pa, in that I am permitted to make my defence a|gain&s;t the accu&s;ation laid by the Jews before your Maje&s;ty, whom I know to be a perfect ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="35" REF="33">Jewi&s;h laws and cu&s;toms: for which rea&s;on I beg your patience.</P>
<P>He then acquaints the king with the manner of his life from his youth; of his being bred a Phari&s;ee, of his being accu&s;ed for a&s;&s;erting the re&s;urrection of the dead; appeals to him why it &s;hould be thought a thing incredi|ble, that God, who is omnipotent, &s;hould rai&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="34">the dead. Confe&s;&s;es his own former unbelief; the havock that he made among&s;t the church; his extraordinary conver&s;ion; and many other things, re|lating both to him&s;elf and to the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And at la&s;t asked king Agrippa this que&s;|tion; '<HI>Believe&s;t thou the prophets, O king?</HI> I am &s;atisfied thou do&s;t; and knowe&s;t their predictions to be fulfilled.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="35">This was &s;o home a challenge to Agrippa, that in the publick pre&s;ence he declared, that Paul had al|mo&s;t per&s;uaded him to be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Upon this the a&s;&s;embly broke up: And when Agrippa and Fe&s;lus had con&s;ulted together about Paul's ca&s;e, they freely owned that the accu&s;ation laid again&s;t him was not puni&s;hable by death or im|pri&s;onment.</P>

<PB N="40" REF="38">under a guard commanded by one Julius, in a &s;hip belonging to a &s;ea port of My&s;ia; in which they &s;et &s;ail, and coa&s;ted along A&s;ia till they arrived at Sidon; where Julius, who treated Paul very re&s;pectfully, gave him leave to go a&s;hore and re&s;re&s;h him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sailing from thence, they came in fight of the &s;land of Cyprus, where they were to lie by a
<PB N="41" REF="39">while; but the winds pre|&s;enting, they pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eas of Cilicia and Pam|phylia, and came to Mira, a maritime city of Lycia. Here Julius finding a large &s;hip bound for Italy, took his pri&s;oners on board her, and with much ado made Salome, a city of Crete: from whence, after they had been long beating at &s;ea with contrary winds, and very &s;tormy weather,
<PB N="42" REF="40">they arrived at Fair-ha|vens, near La&s;ca; where Paul would have per&s;uad|ed captain Julius to wait for more &s;ea&s;onable wea|ther: but he preferring the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip's judgment, they put to &s;ea, intending to reach Phoe|nice, a harbour of Creto, where there was &s;afe rid|ing, and there to winter; and they having a light gale of &s;outh, they que&s;|tioned
<PB N="43" REF="41">not in the lea&s;t of gaining their point.</P>
<P>But they &s;oon found them&s;elves mi&s;taken; for the wind &s;uddenly tacking about, blew &s;o very hard at north ea&s;t; that they were forced to hand all their &s;ails, and let her drive before the wind. And coming under a little i&s;land called Clauda, they had like to have lo&s;t their boat; but with much ado
<PB N="44" REF="42">recovering it, they hoi&s;ted it into the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The next day, the &s;torm continuing, they were forced to cut away their ma&s;ts, and throw all their tackle overboard, and ligh|ten their &s;hip. The &s;torm &s;till increa&s;ing, and neither &s;un nor &s;tars for many days appearing, they gave them|&s;elves over for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Which Paul perceiving, he told them that he had
<PB N="45" REF="43">&s;een a vi&s;ion, which a&s;&s;ur|ed him that not a &s;oul of them &s;hould be lo&s;t, tho' the &s;hip &s;hould.</P>
<P>The &s;hip thus driving for fourteen days at the mercy of the winds and waves, about midnight the &s;ailors fan&s;ied they were near land; and throwing the lead, they &s;ounded, and found it twenty fa|thoms, then fifteen, and it &s;till &s;haling, and being
<PB N="46" REF="44">night, they apprehended they might &s;trike upon &s;ome &s;helves in the dark, &s;o they let go four anchors a&s;tern, and waited for day.</P>
<P>And now the &s;eamen re&s;olving to &s;hift for them|&s;elves, had hoi&s;ted the boat overboard, under pretence of mooring the &s;hip ahead as they had done a&s;tern: but Paul perceiving their de&s;ign, told captain Julius, that if the &s;ailors were &s;uf|fered
<PB N="47" REF="45">to quit the &s;hip, they &s;hould be in danger of be|ing all lo&s;t. Upon this the &s;oldiers, to prevent their de&s;ign, cut the ropes, and let the boat go adrift.</P>
<P>Now Paul per&s;uades them on board to take &s;ome refre&s;hment. The number of all that were in the &s;hip was two hundred &s;eventy &s;ix, including &s;ol|diers and pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>In the &s;pace between
<PB N="48" REF="46">that and day-break, they all eat and drank, and were refre&s;hed; having had no lei&s;ure or thought of eat|ing for a con&s;iderable time before. After this refre&s;h|ment they &s;ell chearfully to work, unloading the &s;hip not only of goods but of the provi&s;ions, and throwing them into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>When it was day, they di&s;covered a creak and a
<PB N="49" REF="47">haven, into which they endeavoured to put; and when they had weighed the anchors, they made to the &s;hore, and run the &s;hip aground, where &s;he &s;oon bulg'd. The captain then ordered the pri&s;oners that could &s;wim to throw them&s;elves into the &s;ea fir&s;t; and the re&s;t on bro|ken pieces got &s;afe to land: where when they were all arrived, they knew the
<PB N="50" REF="48">place to be the i&s;land Me|lita, or. Malta.</P>
<P>The i&s;landers &s;eeing them in di&s;tre&s;s, treated them with great humani|ty; making fires to warm their wet and weary limbs. But whil&s;t they were dry|ing and warming them|&s;elves, a viper, driven from her hole by the heat of the fire, leaped out and fa&s;ten|ed upon Paul's hand: which when the natives,
<PB N="51" REF="49">&s;aw, they concluded him guilty of murder, and that divine vengeance had pur|&s;ued him to that place, to die by the bite of this ve|nomous creature: but he &s;hook it off into the fire, and felt no harm. On &s;eeing this, they pre&s;ent|ly alter'd their opinion, and concluded him a God.</P>

<P>HAving quitted the whi&s;pering gallery, you are next invited to &s;ee the above curio&s;ities; for which favour <HI>each per&s;en pays Two-pence.</HI></P>
<P>The Library room is
<PB N="53" REF="51">large and beautiful; the wain&s;coting, carvings, &s;helves, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> are of nice workman&s;hip; but not|with&s;tanding there is a large collection of books in it the &s;helves appear ve|ry thin, and tho&s;e lock'd up in a profound &s;ilence; &s;ome lolling fa&s;t a&s;leep one way, and &s;ome another.</P>
<P>The&s;e books were de|&s;igned for the u&s;e of the clergy belonging to the
<PB N="54" REF="52">cathedral: but what from the height of its &s;ituation, which is half way up the cupola; and the dulne&s;s of its company, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;ily of a parcel of anti|quated, mu&s;t, crabbed old authors; makes it very &s;eldom vi&s;ited by them. Their chief u&s;e now is to be made a publick &s;hew of (like &s;o many mon&s;ters) to &s;trangers, country peo|ple, and little ma&s;ters and
<PB N="55" REF="53">mi&s;&s;es; who, whenever they come to &s;ee this fine Library, mu&s;t always take care to go into the room on tiptoe, for fear of di&s;|turbing any of the&s;e drou|&s;y old gentlemen.</P>
<P>The floor of this room is very curious, being im|laid, without peg or nail, with &s;o much art and in|genuity, that it really looks very beautiful.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a fine pic|ture
<PB N="56" REF="54">in it, of the right re|verend Henry Compton, late lord bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P><HI>The Model of St. Peter's at Rome.</HI></P>
<P>This was taken by Sir Chri&s;topher Wren from the church of St. Peter at Rome, whil&s;t he re&s;ided there; and from this, with &s;ome alterations, our cathe|dral of St. Paul was built:
<PB N="57" REF="55">he having took care to correct in the latter, what he &s;aw a blemi&s;h in the former. This model &s;tands in a large room, where tho&s;e who are curious may examine it. 'Tis a fine piece, though now fallen &s;omewhat to decay.</P>
<P>As to the great Bell and Clock, I have. &s;poke of them before in the fir&s;t Volume, pag. 77. to which
<PB N="58" REF="56">I mu&s;t refer my young readers; and &s;hall only add, that the way to them is both dark and &s;omewhat difficult to a&s;cend, and therefore not advi&s;able for my young readers to ven|ture up, without a proper guide. Be&s;ides, &s;hould the clock happen to &s;trike whil&s;t they are in the bell lo&s;t, the &s;ound is &s;o &s;ur|pri&s;ingly loud and &s;hock|ing to tho&s;e who are un|accu&s;tomed
<PB N="59" REF="57">to it, that they would imagine it would rend the very tower all to pieces.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which is ob&s;ervable, that this clock is wound up once a day, which gene|rally takes up an hour's time: and as 'tis then &s;et, it is looked upon to be ve|ry exact.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, You are &s;hewn the grand Geometrical
<PB N="60" REF="58">Stairca&s;e; which is a cu|rious and wonderful piece of workman&s;hip, and &s;o artfully contrived, that the &s;upport of the whole prin|cipally depends on the foot-&s;tone only. This, and the &s;tone &s;tairca&s;e at Hampton. court, are the only two of the kind that are to be met with in any of our publick buildings.</P>
<P>To give a more parti|cular account of its beau|ties,
<PB N="61" REF="59">would require the judgment of one who is conver&s;ant in the &s;cience, to which I mu&s;t ingenu|ou&s;ly acknowledge my &s;elf a &s;tranger.</P>

<P>THE pillars of the church that &s;upport the roof, are two ranges, with their entablature and beautiful arches, whereby the body of the church and choir are divided into
<PB N="63" REF="61">three i&s;les. The roof of each is adorn'd with arch|es, and &s;pacious periphe|ries of enrichments; as &s;hields, leaves, chaplets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> admirably carved in &s;tone.</P>
<P>At the we&s;t end of the church there are three doors which lead to the above i&s;les; from each of which you have a beauti|ful pro&s;pect the whole length of the church,
<PB N="64" REF="62">without any interception from the pillars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t within the door of the north i&s;le, on the left hand, is the morning pray|er chapel, where divine &s;ervice is performed every day in the week, excepting Sundays: from Lady-day to Michaelmas, at &s;ix in the morning; and from Michaelmas to Lay-day, at &s;even. In the north tower is the bell for calling people to prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="63">The front of this cha|pel has a very beautiful skreen of curious wain&s;cot, and adorn'd with twelve columns; their entabla|tures, arched pediments, and the royal arms, en|riched with cherubims, and each pediment be|tween four va&s;es, all cu|riou&s;ly carved; and the skreen is &s;enced with iron|work.</P>
<P>Next to the morning
<PB N="66" REF="64">prayer chapel is the Lord Mayor's ve&s;try; to which he generally repairs with his attendants, before he takes his &s;eat in the choir: and then divine &s;ervice immediately begins.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the &s;outh i&s;le, on the right hand, is the door that leads to the geometrical &s;tairca&s;e: Next to that is the bi&s;hop of London's &s;piritual court; which has
<PB N="67" REF="65">a beautiful skreen of curi|ous wain&s;cot; with co|lumns, carvings, and other enrichments, like tho&s;e of the morning prayer cha|pel. A little beyond this court, on the left hand, is a beautiful marble font; which for largene&s;s, the finene&s;s of its marble, and curious workman&s;hip, ex|cels all others; for which rea&s;on, I thought the pic|ture of it would not be

<PB N="76" REF="74">twelve Canons, and &s;ix Vicars choral.</P>
<P>The north and &s;outh &s;ides of the choir have each thity &s;talls, be&s;ides the Bi&s;hop's throne and &s;eat on the &s;outh &s;ide, and the Lord Mayor's on the north: all which compo&s;e one va&s;t body of curious carved work of the fine&s;t wain&s;cot, done by that ex|cellent arti&s;t the late Mr. Gribeline Gibbon; as was

<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of the entrance into the choir is the dean's ve&s;try; and near that the &s;inging boys ve&s;|try; and on the noth &s;ide the re&s;identiarys and &s;ing|ing mens ve&s;try, where they all robe and unrobe.</P>
<P>There are four Vergers belonging to this church; &s;o called from <HI>virga,</HI> a rod,

<P>THE pa&s;&s;age down to the&s;e vaults, is by a door in the body of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="78">The&s;e vaults are indeed very &s;pacious, but at the &s;ame time dark and gloo|my, and &s;trike a kind of horror in tho&s;e who de|&s;cend, in order to &s;urvey the numerous and ma&s;&s;y pillars and arches which &s;upport this prodigious pile of buildings; of which they may be able to form &s;ome idea, from the glim|mering light that is intro|duced into it from the

<P>However, this place is too &s;olemn, melancholy and unplea&s;ant, for our young readers to roam about in; neither indeed are they invited to &s;ee it, as they are the other curi|o&s;ities belonging to the church: and therefore would advi&s;e them to be contented with this ac|count of it, rather than

<P>Under the choir there was formerly the pari&s;h church of St. Faith, com|monly called, <HI>St. Faith's under St. Paul's;</HI> of which there is now no remains. There is indeed a &s;pot of ground railed in, and &s;et apart for the burial of the dead of that pari&s;h, which is &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and united
<PB N="84" REF="82">to that of St. Au&s;tin's.So that the notion which is entertain'd by &s;everal per|&s;ons, and by others confi|dently a&s;&s;erted, that there is a pari&s;h church now be|neath the choir; and that there are prayers and preaching &s;till performed therein on &s;ome particular days, is vulgar error, and altogether groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>There are under the choir, in this dark repo&s;i|tory,
<PB N="85" REF="83">the monuments of &s;everal eminent per&s;ons; but as it would be too te|dious to give a de&s;cription of them all, and no ways entertaining to the young reader, we &s;hall pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence, and take notice only of that of the Architect of this grand building, who lies interr'd in a little corner clo&s;e to the foundation wall, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide, next Wat|ling-&s;treet.
<PB N="86" REF="84">There is a plain &s;tone fix'd again&s;t the wall at his head, with the following in&s;cription in capitals:

<P><PB N="93" REF="91">This Monument &s;tands upon an a&s;cent from the &s;treet of three or four &s;teps, upon a large vault of &s;tone, arched.</P>

<PB N="94" REF="92">balcony, a hundred and thirty three feet; and from the balcony to the top of the flame, is thirty eight feet: And the height of the whole Monument from the ground, be&s;ides the vault and foundation, to the top of the flame, is two hundred and two feet; the circumference of the &s;haft forty &s;even feet and a half; its dia|meter from without the
<PB N="95" REF="93">wall, fifteen feet; within|&s;ide, nine feet diameter; the thickne&s;s of the &s;tone wall of the &s;haft is three feet.</P>
<P>It hath three hundred and forty five &s;teps, or &s;tairs, from the ground up to the balcony; and niches in the wall with &s;eats to re&s;t in, as people go up: and from the balcony up|wards is a ladder of iron &s;teps to go into the urn;
<PB N="96" REF="94">out of which the flame, all gilt with godl, i&s;&s;ueth; and to the &s;tairs, having an open newel, there is a rail of iron to re&s;t the hand upon all the way up.</P>

<P>THE &s;ide towards the &s;treet hath a repre&s;en|tation of the de&s;truction of the city by the fire, and the rebuilding of it again, by &s;everal curiou&s;ly engraven figures made in full proportion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t is the figure of a
<PB N="102" REF="100">woman repre&s;enting Lon|don, &s;itting on ruins, in a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate po&s;ture, her head hanging down, and her hair all loo&s;e about her, the &s;word lying by her, and her left hand carele&s;ly laid upon it. A &s;econd figure is Time with his wings and bald head, coming behind her, and gently lifting her up. Another female figure on the &s;ide of her, laying
<PB N="103" REF="101">her hand upon her, and with a &s;cepter winged in her other hand, directing her to look upwards; for it points up to two beau|tiful godde&s;&s;es &s;itting in the clouds; one leaning on a cornucopia, denoting Plenty: the other having a palm-branch in her hand, &s;ignifying Victory or Triumph. Underneath this figure of London in the mid&s;t of the ruins is
<PB N="104" REF="102">a dragon with his paw upon the &s;hield of a red cro&s;s, the arms of Lon|don: Over her head are repre&s;ented hou&s;es burn|ing, and flames breaking out thro' the windows; behind her citizens look|ing on, and &s;ome of them lifting up their hands.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e figures is a pavement of &s;tone, rais'd with three or four &s;teps; on which appears
<PB N="105" REF="103">king Charles the &s;econd in a Roman habit, with a truncheon in his right hand, and a laurel about his head; coming towards the woman in the de&s;pair|ing po&s;ture afore&s;aid; and giving orders to two or three others to de&s;cend the &s;teps towards her. The firit hath wings on her head, and a crown of na|ked boys dancing; and in her hand &s;omething re|&s;embling
<PB N="106" REF="104">an harp. Then another figure of one go|ing down the &s;teps, fol|lowing her, repre&s;enting Architect; &s;hewing a &s;cheme, or model for re|building the city, held in the right hand; and the le&s;t holding a &s;quare and compa&s;&s;es. Behind the&s;e two &s;tands another figure holding up an hat, denot|ing Liberty. Next be|hind the king is the duke
<PB N="107" REF="105">of York, holding a gar|land ready to crown the ri&s;ing city, and a &s;word lifted up in the other hand to de&s;end her. Behind this a third figure, with and earl's coronet on his head. A fourth, behind all, hold|ing a lion with a bridle in his mouth. Over the&s;e figures is repre&s;ented an hou&s;e in building, and a labourer going up a ladder with an hodd upon his
<PB N="108" REF="106">back. La&s;tly, underneath the &s;tone pavement where|on the king &s;tands, is a good figure of envy, peeping forth, gnawing an heart.</P>
