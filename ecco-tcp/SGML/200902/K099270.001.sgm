<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE motive by which I am urged to write a Preface to this little book of running remarks, is, chiefly, to enter a caveat again&s;t a charge, which precipitate readers may be plea&s;ed to bring again&s;t it, upon account of my having admitted <HI>trifles,</HI> that, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eem not worthy &s;o much notice.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="5">This, certainly, I &s;hould not have done, had I not been fully per&s;uaded that, the&s;e very trifles, light, airy and un&s;ub&s;tantial, as they appear, more forcibly mark a cha|racter, develope an action, how|ever entangled by circum&s;tances, and &s;erve as a clue to unfold the mazes of the heart, than any of tho&s;e elaborate performances which have, for their objects, the mighty, the marvellous, and the magnifi|cent.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="6">Tho&s;e who have, at any time, done me the honour to make my former writings a part of their amu&s;ement, will &s;ee and recollect that I was, long ago, of this opinion; and, as I grow older in the world, and more experienced in its manners, I have &s;till greater rea&s;on to imagine it is &s;olidly founded.</P>
<P>Were not long prefaces a large evil, the defence of what appear to be <HI>trifles,</HI> in literature and in
<PB N="xii" REF="7">
life, might lead into a plea&s;ing &s;peculation. But this is, in part, unnece&s;&s;ary, as many &s;entiments on this very &s;ubject are interwoven into the body of the book it&s;elf: a few <HI>others,</HI> however, pre&s;s upon me ju&s;t now to introduce them, and the reader is therefore invited to receive them courteou&s;ly.</P>
<P>In calling to mind a conci&s;e li&s;t of the mo&s;t celebrated of tho&s;e writers, who ju&s;tly reflect &s;o much credit on the genius of the country (to which, after all migrations of
<PB N="xiii" REF="8">
bu&s;ine&s;s, of plea&s;ure, and of curio&s;ity, I &s;hall return with joy, as to the dear &s;oil of my nativity) I find they are indebted for the lu&s;tre of their literary character, rather to the art of embelli&s;hing trifles, than to any formal de&s;cription of the great, the grand, or the extra|ordinary.</P>
<P>But this does not ari&s;e entirely, as &s;ome might &s;u&s;pect, from the &s;uperficiality of the age, which is &s;aid to take a delight in unimportant publications; nor does it proceed
<PB N="xiv" REF="9">
from want of depth in the genius of the writer. On the contrary, it is, in both ca&s;es, rather a matter for compliment than of cen&s;ure. The proof of this requires no &s;ophi&s;try; but lies upon the &s;urface open to every man's ob&s;ervation. That which is too obvious (and very many things are &s;o) requires only a half-glance, of the mo&s;t lack-lu&s;tre eye to be di&s;covered. For in&s;tance; the &s;pacious building, the &s;tupendous mountain which &s;eems ambitious of Heaven; the ca&s;tle, who&s;e emulous &s;pire cleaveth
<PB N="xv" REF="10">
the clouds; the fore&s;t, which fills the eye as far as it can &s;weep; and the appearance of an huge metro|polis, like that of London, Con|&s;tantinople or Paris, taken on the expanded &s;cale, with all their tow|ers, ho&s;pitals, palaces, and public buildings, are objects too unweildy to be mi&s;&s;ed; in&s;omuch that he who is not wont to ob&s;erve, mu&s;t perforce run his no&s;e again&s;t them. Thus, things which are &s;een too plainly, are &s;een by every body, and &s;carce regarded by any body. A citizen of London, who hath many
<PB N="xvi" REF="11">
years re&s;ided in that metropolis, &s;hall &s;urvey &s;uch a prodigious object as St. Paul's, and a native of Paris look upon the Louvre, and &s;lightly tell you, that they are &s;uperb edifices, and the admiration of the world; but the&s;e prai&s;es are indeter|minate, and make no durable im|pre&s;&s;ions. Now, were we to take the&s;e two citizens into the body of the&s;e &s;eparate buildings, and ima|gine one of them to be an organi&s;t, and one a painter, they would di&s;|cover their profe&s;&s;ion, and their hearts in five minutes. The organi&s;t
<PB N="xvii" REF="12">
would &s;ound the keys of the in&s;tru|ment, and, with the ear of a connoi&s;&s;eur, be either plea&s;ed or pained, as it happened to be in, or out of tune, and the painter would execrate a picture for bearing marks, and almo&s;t imperceptible touches of awkwardne&s;s, although a common per&s;on, by looking at the picture, and hearing the organ, would &s;ay of the fir&s;t, that it was beautiful, and of the &s;econd, that it was harmonious. The rea&s;on is, that the heart is generally in love with
<PB N="xviii" REF="13">
its old habits, and arti&s;ts attend to the minutiae.</P>
<P>But what, in my opinion, makes more again&s;t tho&s;e o&s;ten&s;ible, and glaring facts which look us full in the face, is, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, from the very nature of their public &s;ituation upon the globe, that they &s;hould be favourable either to in|du&s;try or to ingenuity. They afford &s;cope neither to genius, labour, imagination, nor the heart; and, without there is &s;omewhat of heart, beating bri&s;kly through every
<PB N="xix" REF="14">
undertaking, whether it be of the pen or pencil, I leave you to judge, if it mu&s;t not be all poverty, &s;tagnation, &s;tupidity, and wretched|ne&s;s. De&s;titute of the animating vibrations of that mo&s;t enchanting machinery, which is every hour &s;hifting the &s;cene in our bo&s;om, every thing mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be &s;ordid, dull, di&s;pirited.</P>
<P>Like the earth, in the ab&s;ence of that &s;un, who is now darting his ray vertically over my head, vegetation is enwrapped in gloom, and, for the
<PB N="xx" REF="15">
time being, a garden is the very la&s;t thing in the world into which one would go for good &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Now without relying on the gaiety of this &s;imile, which is made on May-day, when every body knows, &s;imiles vegetate &s;o fa&s;t, that they can almo&s;t make them&s;elves, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the author; without, I &s;ay, depending on this May-bu&s;h of a &s;imile, it is, I conceive, clearly deduceable from the pre|ceding &s;entiments in plain pro&s;e, that it is the heart which informs,
<PB N="xxi" REF="16">
in&s;pires, and animates all literature; that all its powers, properties, propen&s;ities and pa&s;&s;ions, are be&s;t &s;een by penetrating into its rece&s;&s;es; that it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a moral writer to take it as it were by &s;ur|pri&s;e, while at one moment it is beating with apprehen&s;ion; &s;trug|gling at another with concealed anxiety; throbbing with expecta|tion; trembling with fear, or pant|ing with hope; that little is to be known by taking a man's mind in the lump. We &s;hould follow the example of &s;urgeons, who think
<PB N="xxii" REF="17">
nothing of his body, while they are only gazing upon it as an entire carca&s;e. We &s;hould take up the inci&s;ion-pen, call the utmo&s;t keenne&s;s into our eye, and begin to di&s;&s;ect and to di&s;member; a thou&s;and curious turnings, difficult labyrinths, and critical meanders, various as the veins, and twined into branch|ings equally multiplied, are all to be noted by him who looks at his &s;ubject; e&s;pecially when that &s;ub|ject is the human heart, in an un|&s;u&s;picious moment.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="18">When the heart, on the contrary, is dre&s;&s;ed our for great actions, which are to be done in the eye of the world, the whole matter is <HI>premeditated;</HI> and the heart is, in that ca&s;e, in the &s;ituation of a &s;tage-player, who &s;its deliberately down to his looking-gla&s;s, to a&s;&s;ume, for the hour that he is to &s;trut, pre|ci&s;ely that &s;ort of ge&s;ture which &s;uits his character: but then the&s;e ge&s;tures form no part of the actor's private di&s;po&s;ition, which, although it is now the repre&s;entative of every
<PB N="xxiv" REF="19">
amiable quality, may, po&s;&s;ibly, when the robes of the theatre are laid a&s;ide, be deformed by all that is odious and contemptible. I would no more form any conclu&s;ions of either the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of a man's heart, from his doing any particular bu&s;ine&s;s before twenty &s;pectators, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have had a week's, or even a day's <HI>prepa|ration</HI> (in which time if he is not an ideot, he certainly may be per|fect in his part, be it what it will) than I would pretend to determine of a woman's beauty or ugline&s;s
<PB N="xxv" REF="20">
who&s;e face is covered with a veil. Faces, like hearts, are &s;o differently formed, that, <HI>under a veil,</HI> there is no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing the truth. That fine rubied tint that &s;eems to glow in the cheek, may, for ought I can tell, be the blu&s;h of nature or the bru&s;h of art: the clearne&s;s that appears to adorn the complexion, may be the true tran&s;parency of beauty, or <HI>tout au contraire,</HI> it may be a kind of white powder, more poi&s;onous than ar&s;enic. Tho&s;e gentle &s;inkings, moreover, which look beneath this umbrage, like
<PB N="xxvi" REF="21">
the beds of the dimples, may be tho&s;e horrid pits which have been dug in the cheek by the &s;mall-pox. In &s;hort as &s;oul and body very often club together, to carry on any farce for which they are prepared, I wholly renounce any &s;ort of &s;aga|city, when I look at them in &s;uch &s;ituations. It is like a naked man fighting two others armed cap-a-pee! No, it is from quiet, un|looked-for, minute &s;urveys, and tho&s;e upon little circum&s;tances, in which men are little guarded, as thinking that they betray nothing:
<PB N="xxvii" REF="22">
it is, from watching the lucky cri&s;is, and catching it up as the golden opportunity to pry into tho&s;e nooks, corners and bye-places of the heart, that are incautiou&s;ly left open, that its true &s;tate mu&s;t be a&s;cer|tained to the hundreth part of a vibration.</P>
<P>Many of our Engli&s;h writers have re&s;ted their fame on the &s;well of heroic actions, and on the pomps of tho&s;e gigantic circum&s;tances which belong to them. Such exhibitions while they are yet new, arre&s;t the
<PB N="xxviii" REF="23">
&s;treams of life in their progre&s;s, and give exactly that &s;ort of &s;tu|pendous &s;en&s;ation, which &s;trikes us, upon &s;uddenly lifting the eye to a prodigious ridge of rocks, or pile of buildings, e&s;pecially if the latter &s;hould happen to be ornamented with all the great &s;trokes of &s;culp|ture, and over-&s;ized figures, &s;uch as mice bigger than men, and men larger than elephants; we open the mouth; and declare it is very extraordinary: but, pre&s;ently, na|ture is weary of &s;uch di&s;proportions, and we turn from them to the
<PB N="xxix" REF="24">
minutiae, from the exactitude of which we can draw our inferences with accuracy and preci&s;ion. Let it be taken into con&s;ideration, how|ever, that, when the eye hath once ached, at gratifying its a&s;toni&s;hment upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, it will not ri&s;k a &s;econd pain. There is no recompen&s;e: &s;o that after the fir&s;t &s;ally, the circulation proceeds in its u&s;ual cour&s;e, without ever again exciting an emotion, either of plea&s;ure or of pain.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="25">Other authors have rejected the mighty and mon&s;trous, for the trifling and minute.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e who &s;tand foremo&s;t in the Briti&s;h li&s;t, among&s;t the moderns, we find the names of Fielding and Sterne. The&s;e drew figures from the life. Like true and impartial painters, they con|&s;idered the heart, exactly as it was: every feature they faithfully pre|&s;erved. They dealt in the mo&s;t delicate facts: they followed their
<PB N="xxxi" REF="26">
object from the &s;treet, from the theatre, and from bu&s;tling &s;ocieties into his own hou&s;e: they watched the proce&s;s of his after-reflections; his conduct to &s;ervants, children, wife, connections: they looked at his heart in the moment of &s;ucce&s;s, and, in that, immediately after di&s;|appointment. They regarded not the meagre de&s;cription of hou&s;es, towers, turrets, &s;teeples or fortifica|tions in the gro&s;s, but they &s;eparated one part from another: they di&s;|criminated: they divided: &s;ubdi|vided: united: and, la&s;tly, having
<PB N="xxxii" REF="27">
patiently marked the &s;maller actions, they were able to pronounce with certainty of the greater, till, in the end, the truth of the whole became evident and di&s;tingui&s;hable.</P>
<P>For my own part, I have here written travels, which I wholly dedicate to the reader's <HI>heart.</HI> No one hath ever travelled in the &s;ame way, but the pathetic Yorick; and Yorick hath by no means exhau&s;ted the ob&s;ervations to be picked up in a tour through France. I put my name to the&s;e little volumes with
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="28">
equal plea&s;ure and confidence, be|cau&s;e every page in them was written in the ardour of relating &s;ome event, which really happened; and the true impre&s;&s;ions <HI>of the heart</HI> are given in every &s;entence.</P>
<P>To obviate all objection that might ari&s;e, from the notion of the <HI>idea</HI> of the&s;e volumes being borrowed, from that beautiful work called The Sentimental Journey, it is reque&s;ted that the reader will <HI>peru&s;e</HI> the performance before he <HI>judges</HI> of it; and then he will find that the very
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="29">
PLAN of the&s;e Travels, and tho&s;e of Yorick, agree in no part &s;o much, as that, they were both written to <HI>amu&s;e the heart,</HI> and with <HI>a de&s;ign to be printed.</HI></P>

<P>The prolixity of this advice&mdash; fir&s;t &s;hewing me the object, and then artfully adorning it &mdash; now tempting my curio&s;ity, and now

firing my fancy, did the bu&s;ine&s;s ten times better than all the down|right per&s;ua&s;ions in the world.

<P>The do&s;e, now gently admini&s;tered by my phy&s;ician, was perfectly palatable. It was made up by one of the be&s;t and gentle&s;t of the human race, and, as a proof that I di&s;covered nothing of the <HI>medicinal</HI> in it, which, whether in cathartics

<P>I am po&s;itive my tran&s;lation was true to the letter and &s;en&s;e of the original; for, as my phy&s;ician talked upon the benefits of a tour to the Continent, there were &s;o many points &s;ymptomatic of his meaning that any man, very moderately &s;killed in phy&s;iognomy, mu&s;t have interpreted correctly.

<P>Entering therefore into the &s;pirit of tran&s;lation, I drew my conclu&s;ion in the following manner&mdash;France, you would &s;ay, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her train of &s;alutary airs, &s;ongs, &s;erenades, and dances, might re&s;tore nature to her healthy tone again. &mdash; There, you imagine I might breathe a more

<P>A NEW &s;cheme, aptly projected, and in the right moment, is as the morning &s;un which brighteneth more and more unto the perfect day. From the time it takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, fancy begins the bu&s;ine&s;s of decora|tion, and mixes up her mo&s;t beau|tiful colours with the nice&s;t art and ingenuity.

<P>The mo&s;t charming circum&s;tances, are, generally, the mo&s;t unexpected.

<PB N="57" REF="99">
which fa&s;ten and connect the cor|re&s;ponding thoughts one to another. In a female &s;ubject, the&s;e threads are &s;o extremely fine, that, although every link is di&s;tinctly &s;eparated, yet the whole chain which wreaths it&s;elf round the heart, &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, a chaos of confu&s;ed matter, unadju&s;ted by any &s;ort of oeconomy. But to have any &s;ound notion of this philo&s;ophical ana|tomy, in which neither Galen, Hippocrates, or Machaon, appear to have been adequate adepts, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know, fir&s;t, that the &s;en&s;ibilities of the beautiful &s;ex are not only more tran&s;parent and im|pre&s;&s;ive than tho&s;e of the male

<P>Thus, for in&s;tance, if a lover looks &s;ombre, a lap-dog is &s;ick, or a ruffle is lacerated, that nerve, upon which, as upon a main &s;pring,

Hence it appears as plain as the page which you are now reading, that women require none of tho&s;e tedious preparations which throw a damp over the face of enjoyment, and which men of books and bu&s;ine&s;s too often demand before their &s;luggi&s;h, ab&s;tract, or Change-alley hearts into feelings &s;uitable to a plea&s;urable &s;urpri&s;e.

<PB N="61" REF="103">
&s;uperiority of the female orga|nization. Every artery, about them, is hung more airily; the avenues which nature hath opened to the heart, though perhaps more involved in mazes, are yet &s;o like a wilderne&s;s of &s;weets, that we have many more inducements to clear the way, and examine them: add to all this that certain voluptuous particles &s;wim along the beautiful labyrinths that are formed by the veins, and always fit them for a &s;pirited propo&s;al at a moment's notice.</P>

<P>At this cri&s;is, ju&s;t as the hilarity of the circle is mantling to the brim, without overflowing, let the &s;age&mdash;but without a &s;age's brow&mdash; who travels for the information <HI>of the heart</HI>&mdash;enter into the &s;ociety as a willing and invited gue&s;t.

<P>The heart takes this word in &s;everal &s;en&s;es, though they all have a corre&s;pondence. I. With the hearts of young men, it implies a quick &s;en&s;e of re&s;entment with which is connected an high notion of dignity,

independence, &amp;c. &amp;c. It mu&s;t always be u&s;ed with great caution in the company of military people, and in conver&s;ation about women: nay the very tone with which it is articulated, mu&s;t be correctly and complacently in tune, otherwi&s;e many fatal accidents may happen. II, The heart takes this word to imply, among&s;t per&s;ons in bu&s;ine&s;s, a &s;en&s;e of probity, integrity, fair-dealing, and common hone&s;ty; &s;o that it &s;hould, in this ca&s;e, be always pronounced with a full, copious, un&s;u&s;picious and liberal utterance; as the lea&s;t re&s;erve in the pronunciation may be attended with the de&s;truction of the object whom

The adoption of any expre&s;&s;ions like tho&s;e which are u&s;ed by Hamlet, &s;uch as, we could an we would, a &s;ignificant wag of the finger, an arch turn of the eye, or a &s;hake of the head as much as to &s;ay we know what we know, &mdash;any of the&s;e, at the time of pronouncing the word honour, is enough to make it nece&s;&s;ary to take out a commi&s;&s;ion of bankruptcy.&mdash;</P>

<P>SHE &s;aw &s;olicitude in my air, on my entrance into the room of the inn, and, with a tenderne&s;s which was peculiar to her, enquired into the cau&s;e. On my coming into the room, &s;he was employed at the fire in warming a wrapping cloak, in which, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, I was to enfold my&s;elf when I got into the &s;hip. A cap too, which &s;he had been airing, would, &s;he &s;aid, be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. A &s;mall bottle of cordials to recover the agitated or exhau&s;ted &s;pirits
<PB N="192" REF="234">
after &s;ickne&s;s, her caution had likewi&s;e provided; as it had, al&s;o, drops of hart&s;horn to remove tho&s;e faintings to which I was &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All the&s;e little preparations of her tenderne&s;s were, like &s;o many fair and favourable breezes, &s;pread forth, to tempt me to the enterprize, and waft over my heart. To &s;trengthen the whole, in came the captain of the packet-boat, with all that hardy-hood, and jolly roughne&s;s in the tones of his voice, as well as that tar-like twi&s;t in the tie of his &s;ilk-handkerchief, which &s;ufficiently mark tho&s;e who are &s;ea&s;oned to that element, which nature &s;eems to have
<PB N="193" REF="235">
prepared rather for fi&s;hes than men.</P>
<P>It was written legibly, in the chapter of the captain's countenance, that the wind blew kindly from the Heavens, and that, with the advantage of the next tide, we &s;hould certainly &s;ail.</P>
<P>Never was any thing&mdash;not ab&s;o|lutely uttered&mdash;more near to the tip of the tongue than a flat refu&s;al to go along with him. The picture of the heart mu&s;t have been admirable. What a pity it is, Reynolds was not at my elbow to copy it! I began with &s;ub&s;tan|tially
<PB N="194" REF="236">
pur&s;eing my front into the deepe&s;t wrinkles of denial, re&s;olved to cut my way through all argu|ments and temptations. When I had thrown as much ruggedne&s;s and &s;everity as I thought proper into my features, I turned round, ju&s;t upon the edge of declaring that I &s;hould not go!</P>
<P>Amelia was, at that very moment, pouring &s;ome of the hart&s;horn drops upon the handkerchief which might refre&s;h me in ca&s;e of any &s;ickne&s;s! What a check was here to a man's intentions! I felt the contracted mu&s;cles unbend, and relax into the yielding &s;oftne&s;s of
<PB N="195" REF="237">
compliance. The heart was going as fa&s;t as it could, to give up the point; but, after much &s;u&s;picious &s;tammer and he&s;itation, it ju&s;t al|lowed me fortitude enough to &s;ay to Amelia "I think, my good girl, we had better have the prudence <HI>to</HI> &mdash; TO &mdash; TO &mdash; I &s;ay my dear traveller, I do take upon me to &s;ay, <HI>that</HI>&mdash;THAT&mdash;THAT&mdash;"</P>
<P>The pau&s;es which were made at the&s;e mono&s;yllables could not have been avoided.</P>
<P>Let the mo&s;t rigid reader that ever was born tell me if they could!</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="238">Immediately parallel to my eye hung a map of the continent of France, and a little above that a chart of Paris, with all its &s;cenery, gaieties and attracting magnificence. The eye treacherou&s;ly dwelt upon the&s;e pro&s;pects; now &s;urveying the city, and now the luxuriances of a new and fruitful country. It was &s;carce a moment's bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash; <HI>for the heart</HI> (which with the wings of imagination travels with the ra|pidity of light) to pa&s;s through all the land that is governed by Louis. I &s;aw the grapes ripen under the &s;un that glows upon the vineyards of Burgundy. As I traced the
<PB N="197" REF="239">
cour&s;e of different countries, as they were marked by meandering lines upon the map, I beheld the clu&s;ters of Champaigne burni&s;h around me. I felt al&s;o the atmo&s;|phere gradually brighten into be|nignity, and all that can gladden the heart of an invalid, as I penetrated into the &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;outh; and after I had taken into my pro&s;pect all the beauties of the Seine and Loire, omitting not whatever fancy imagined might contribute to the flowers and build|ings which embelli&s;h their banks, I looked for &s;ome relief from the&s;e in&s;upportable temptations, at the face of Amelia. There, however,
<PB N="198" REF="240">
in&s;tead of relief, I was attacked by the artillery of arguments &s;till more potent. Her eyes &s;parkled, as I ran my fore finger along the map, as much as to &s;ignify, if this is only the beautiful &s;hadow, how delicious mu&s;t be the &s;ub&s;tance! I wi&s;h it was the moment of depar|ture with all my heart.</P>
<P>A fig for the world's opinion of my weakne&s;s. There are times and &s;ea&s;ons when weakne&s;s is grace|ful. I believe, about this period, my face was as &s;mooth as the lucid &s;tream in which Eve &s;urveyed her&s;elf: but, had a few &s;toic wrinkles &s;till pre&s;erved their inflexibility,
<PB N="199" REF="241">
they would have been pre&s;ently erazed by one of tho&s;e &s;miles, which, from the beginning of the world to this very hour, have de|cided the mo&s;t difficult points in an in&s;tant. And as if all this was not enough, &s;he added the re|inforcement of that eloquence, which, when it flows from a thin and rubied lip, talks down every trace of the mo&s;t ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>"What plea&s;ure &s;hall I enjoy, (&s;aid my fair fellow traveller, gently, and as a friend, pre&s;&s;ing my right hand, which was next to her); what plea&s;ure &s;hall I indeed enjoy, if in our tour to this paradi&s;aical
<PB N="200" REF="242">
land of promi&s;e, health &s;hould deign to be the companion of our journey! The &s;ame beams which are darted upon the grape, and make it &s;o much richer and brighter, than the &s;canty vintage which clings reluctant to the walls of Britain, may animate al&s;o the de|clining man! Added to this, how agreeable will it be to look at the cu&s;toms, and general air, of a coun|try &s;o con&s;picuous, and which makes &s;o brilliant a figure in the map of the world, as France: but, what is yet more&mdash;to have vi&s;ited the metropolis of that gay country! To have been at Paris: at Paris, my dear Sir, which is the &s;eat of
<PB N="201" REF="243">
entertainment, the circuit of delight, the centre of &s;oftne&s;s, elegance, plea&s;ure, polite&s;&s;e, and the Heaven of women! Oh that the packet was this moment under &s;ail! I can &s;carce bear the delay! Sure this is the longe&s;t night in the year! Ah my friend, try to take from the hours &s;ome part of the angui&s;h which I feel from their delay! Fill up the horrid interval with &s;omething that may draw upon the trea&s;ury of our future amu&s;ements! Let every deity, who delights in water, be invoked to favour our pa&s;&s;age. Supplicate Nep|tune, Thetis, with all the Tritons,
<PB N="202" REF="244">
Amphitritons, Naiads, Neriads, and Sea-nymphs in their train! Promi&s;e, even now, while the prayer may be be&s;t formed in the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the heart, to erect temples of unparelled &s;hell-work to the dewy-locked Sabrina! Promi&s;e to rebuild her chariot of entire pearl on our &s;afe arrival! Pray with &s;till greater fervor that the demon Hypochon|dria&s;is may be the only thing which is thrown overboard in our pa&s;&s;age, and, that none of the powers may want the homage or the deference which is due to them, petition the gentle Zephyrus, and all his breezy companions, to
<PB N="203" REF="245">
&s;pread out our canva&s;s, and in|dulgently direct us to the port of Calais!"</P>
<P>So much am I the child of na|ture and the heart, that, &s;o far from checking this torrent of a rhap&s;ody, like a man who had made up his mind upon the &s;ubject, that I was almo&s;t as much affected as the &s;peaker of it. Towards the middle of the invocation to the &s;ea-gods, I gave three jumps with the agility of a Frenchman, and I think my nerves were all the better for the concu&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="246">When &s;he pointed to the environs of Paris, as if to the text of her voluptuous commentary upon the charms of that city, e&s;pecially as her wri&s;t was not without a bracelet, and that bracelet not without a flattering figure, by no means in the attitude of refu&s;al, the animal &s;pirits cour&s;ed along the veins with &s;uch celerity, that I felt them throb at the very ends of my fingers; and, at the conclu&s;ion, every thing within me played a tune &s;o bri&s;k and vivacious, that, had every wave been a rock, I do verily think, &s;o wrought upon
<PB N="205" REF="247">
as I was, I could not have thrown the cold water of refu&s;al, upon the beautiful warm blood which glowed on the face of the&s;e animated hopes of the heart.</P>
