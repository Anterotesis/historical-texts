<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF WILL. RAMBLE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE world is the great &s;cene of life, through which we are to &s;cramble; of cour&s;e the know|ledge of that world, is the be&s;t &s;ci|ence we can learn; but open as it is to the view of every man, &s;pread
<PB N="2" REF="9">as the volume is before us, it is not every one that can read, and fewer there are, that as they read can under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Novels have been introduced to delineate and depict this &s;cene, and characters have been drawn to &s;hew the manners and di&s;po&s;ition of the people&verbar;; but they have in general been &s;o ill penned, as to de&s;troy the very end they aimed at. The characters they have exhibited, have been &s;o deformed, as to bear no re&s;emblance to nature; the traits of life have been &s;o exaggerated, and the truth of things &s;o ma&s;ked, as to deceive the reader, in&s;tead of
<PB N="3" REF="10">informing him; and the dullnes&s;s and in&s;ipidity of modern novels have been &s;uch, as to di&s;gu&s;t and tire him, be|fore he has got half way through them. There are but few men capa|ble of painting life as it is, tho&s;e only who have travelled on, for a number of years, through the vari|ous &s;cenes of it, and made ob&s;erva|tions as they pa&s;&s;ed; and even the&s;e without the happy art of drawing characters to the life, making a pro|per &s;election of them, and bringing them in properly to their aid, can nei|ther hope to improve, or to enter|tain: but a novel fraught with ob|&s;ervation, full of incident, and replete with worldly knowledge, is the mo&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="11">in&s;tructive book a young mind can read; for thus, learning wi&s;dom from the ra&s;hne&s;s and folly of others, he will be able to &s;ee his way before him, avoid the &s;nares and calamities too often attendant upon life, and, per|haps, make his way to the end of it, with ea&s;e and comfort.</P>
<P>It is on this principle, and with the pro&s;pect of being u&s;e to man|kind, that I have attempted to lay before the world, the adventures of a young man, who, in the cour&s;e of a very few years, &s;aw as much of the world, as mo&s;t others have done in double his time. I was very in|timate with him, and of cour&s;e, am
<PB N="5" REF="12">as well able to recite his adventures, as he could have done him&s;elf; he is now no more, and having lelf; no family, I have no ear to wound. The occurrences he met with in life, when related by him to me, were highly entertaining, and I will en|deavour to tran&s;mit them &s;o to my rea|ders.</P>
<P>My friend, Will. Ramble, was the &s;on and only child of a country gentleman, who was great part of his life a Colonel of militia of a county in the &s;outh of England: he bred up his &s;on to a military life, in&s;tilled into him principles of high honour, and gave him a fini&s;hed
<PB N="5" REF="13">education; he was naturally a brave man, of a fine &s;oldier-like figure, and a poli&s;hed gentleman; but never having been, during his father's life, much in the world, except in the military line, in which he was bred; and it being time of peace, his ideas were in a great mea&s;ure con&s;ined to the manners and cu&s;toms of the di&s;|trict in which he lived. His father, however, had brought him on by purcha&s;e in the army, and he was a Lieutenant Colonel of foot, at the age of twenty-eight, when the old gentleman died; on looking into his father's effects, he found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good family-man&s;ion, in the we&s;t; an e&s;tate of about &s;even
<PB N="7" REF="14">hundred pounds a year, and about three thou&s;and pounds in &s;ecurities. Having no tye to fix him to any par|ticular &s;pot, and fortunately having found a tenant for his hou&s;e and land, he determined to &s;pend &s;ome part of his money in the ramble of a few years, in &s;earch of that information he found him&s;elf deficient in; that is, to acquire a knowledge of men and manners, from the objects as they pa&s;s before him; as much as to &s;ay, to travel fir&s;t through his own country, and next, to &s;ee what was doing in the neighbouring ones; perhaps, &s;ays he, in this excur&s;ion I may pick up a wife, with a fortune equal to my
<PB N="8" REF="15">own, that may enable me to retire to my native place, and live with as much credit as did my father before me; in which ca&s;e I will turn my &s;word into a plough-&s;hare: if not, and a war &s;hould break out, I will pur&s;ue the line of my profe&s;&s;ion, and devote my life to the &s;ervice of my country.</P>
<P>The&s;e were my friend Will's principles, and with the&s;e he &s;at out, not for the metropolis, the cen|tre to which all the young and the giddy fly; but proceeded to the ex|tent of his line at fir&s;t, beginning at the very North of the Highlands, and determining to retreat &s;outhward.</P>
<P>The Colonel took with him an
<PB N="9" REF="16">hone&s;t faithful &s;ervant, and Iri&s;hman, that had been recommended to him by a Brigadier-General, who had &s;erved &s;everal campaigns in India, and who having no further occa&s;ion for him, urged my friend to take him, as a man who had travelled through mo&s;t countries, had a great deal of &s;hrewd cunning, a courage and &s;tea|dine&s;s equal to a bull-dog, and a fidelity not to be corrupted, and &s;carcely to be equalled. He had lo&s;t an eye, in an engagement, but was not on that account the more un|&s;ightly for a &s;oldier's &s;ervice. He was truly di&s;ciplined, and as &s;uch, obedient to command; and though &s;omewhat coar&s;e in his language,
<PB N="10" REF="17">had a certain hone&s;ty about him, that made him a valuable acqui&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>His name was Flint, and his rank a Corporal. When his ma&s;ter con|&s;igned him to my friend, he &s;aid, <Q>Flint, you have had a hard &s;er|vice with <HI>me,</HI> and it is time you &s;hould have a furlough. I am al|mo&s;t worn out in arms; you are a young man, (for he was not more than forty years of age) and that quiet retreat, that I may co|yet, will ill &s;uit your bu&s;y, bu&s;tling &s;pirit; I recommend you, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o my friend Ramble; he is a bro|ther-&s;oldier, if another war &s;hould
<PB N="11" REF="18">break out, with him you may &s;ee a little more of &s;ervice; be faithful to him, as you have been to me, and he will love you as much as I do.</Q> "Flint," returned the Cor|poral, <Q>and plai&s;e your honor, will &s;arve your friend as he would &s;arve your&s;elf. Ill as dame Fortune has treated me, I &s;hall not be unwil|ling to enli&s;t again under her banners, and give our enemies ano|ther drubbing; and if I find in Squire Ramble, as good a com|mander as your honor, I tru&s;t he will find me as good a &s;oldier.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL not give my readers a detail of the various &s;tages our hero pa&s;&s;ed, nor a de&s;criptive ac|count of the &s;everal places at which he &s;topped; I mean neither to be a journali&s;t, nor a travel-writer, but &s;hall relate only the principal adven|tures of his life, and the extraordi|nary characters he met with. Upon this plan I &s;hall only &s;ay, that
<PB N="13" REF="20">getting letters of recommendation into the North, as a gentleman up|on his travels, he made the be&s;t of his way into the Highlands, and was well received at the hou&s;e of Mr. Campbell, a Laird of a Clan, in that part of the world. This gen|tleman's family con&s;i&s;ted of his wife and daughter, and a young lady a niece of Mrs. Campbell's, the daugh|ter of Mr. Ra&s;pe, a Liverpool mer|chant, a little hot-headed, impetuous man, who had a brother &s;ettled in London, and who having been knighted, increa&s;ed the jealou&s;y of this old man beyond conception; he had ama&s;&s;ed a large fortune in the Slave-Trade, and having an only child, this
<PB N="14" REF="21">Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, his fooli&s;h plan was, to marry her, if po&s;&s;ible, to a Lord, and thus out-do his brother in point of ideal con&s;equence; to this end he deprived him&s;elf almo&s;t of the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, to add to his capital; and le&s;t his daughter, a fine girl, &s;hould pick up a hu&s;band of her own, and thus baffle his expectations, he placed her, from the age of thir|teen, under the care of his &s;i&s;ter, married to this Mr. Campbell, deter|mining to keep her there, as it were, out of the world, till &s;he was of a mar|riageable age. In the hou&s;e of Mr. Campbell, the Colonel was very well received, and on account of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, for whom he conceived a
<PB N="15" REF="22">liking, and who&s;e fortune led further to an attachment, he was induced to make a longer &s;tay with the family than he at fir&s;t intended.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered at, that Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, though immured in the cold regions of the North, &s;hould at her time of life, then ju&s;t &s;ixteen, feel a glow in her brea&s;t, at the many fine &s;entiments Cold. Ramble was capable of uttering, and become enamoured with what &s;he heard from &s;o hand&s;ome a man. He addre&s;&s;ed her with all the warmth of a lover, and all the animation of a &s;oldier, and though his opportunities were but few, he availed him&s;elf of them,
<PB N="16" REF="23">and he being the fir&s;t &s;a&s;hlonable man &s;he had &s;een, &s;he became pre|&s;ently in love with him.</P>
<P>There was nothing in the cha|racter of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe &s;ingular or worth remarking; it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, &s;he was a girl of &s;pirit, of fine figure, had a plea&s;ing face, and was altogether an object of admiration. It was nece&s;&s;ary to conceal their liking for each other, her father having ac|quainted his &s;i&s;ter with his de&s;ign, and all they could do was to plan how they &s;hould meet each other in future. Mrs. Campbell was as watch|ful as an Argus, but the Colonel found means to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="24">through Flint, who was as indu&s;trious and cautious as a &s;py.</P>
<P>Scarce had he made his <HI>entr&eacute;e</HI> at Mr. Campbell's hou&s;e, than he was waited on by Mr. Macanochy, a Scotch Prie&s;t, the Mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, one of tho&s;e officious men who are always in our way, and who came now to welcome the Colonel to Fochabar, that being the name of the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>The Colonel had, by means of his &s;ervant Flint, ju&s;t received a letter from Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, which he was ki&s;&s;ing with fervency when Macanochy entered the room without any intro|duction,
<PB N="18" REF="25"><Q>In gude troth Sir, you &s;eem, (&s;aid he) if my eyne dinna deceive me, to be mair in love with that lettre, than ony bra lad of the Highlands I hae yet &s;een, wi his bonnie la&s;&s;ie.</Q> <Q>Indeed, replied the Colonel, I am; it is from the deare&s;t friend I have, and I am impatient to read its contents,</Q></P>
<P><Q>Dinana let me interrupt you then, (&s;aid Macanochy) dinna let me in|terrupt you.</Q> Here he took &s;ome &s;nuff with his right hand, from the left hand pocket of his wai&s;tcoat, which was full of it, and filling his no&s;e, &s;cattering it plentifully down his bo&s;om, the Colonel took this
<PB N="19" REF="26">opportunity of opening the letter. Scarce had he pa&s;&s;ed his eye over the fir&s;t line, but Macanochy drew up clo&s;e along &s;ide of him, and tapped him on the &s;leeve with <Q>an ye be a freend of the Campbell faa|malie, youre cum in a loocky our; for we are t hae a mu&s;ter of the Clan in the morning;</Q> but ob&s;erving the Colonel impatient to read his letter adds, <Q>dinna let me interrupt ye, maun; dinna let me interrupt ye;</Q> (and takes another pinch) but &s;carce had the Colonel read another line, but he approaches him as before with, <Q>I am bold to &s;ay, we mu&s;ter mair men in Focha|bar, than in ony paari&s;h in aw the
<PB N="20" REF="27">Highlands.</Q> I beg your pardon, replied the Colonel, with a degree of mortification, <Q>I &s;hall be happy to hear your &s;tory, and &s;ee your mu&s;ter, at any other time; but this letter requires an immediate an|&s;wer, and I hope you will excu&s;e me.</Q> <Q>In Gode's name (replies Macanochy) dinna let me interrupt ye; gang awa, read your letter, and an&s;wer it.</Q> At this moment Flint entered the room, as upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Colonel took that opportunity of leaving it, &s;aying to Flint as he pa&s;&s;ed, don't let him fol|low me. Flint &s;eeing Macanochy going after his ma&s;ter, &s;houldered his &s;tick, and placing him&s;elf again&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="28">the door as a centinel, cried out aloud, <Q>who goes there; who are you; where do you come from; where are you going?</Q> I mu&s;t not omit here to notice, that Flint, though he did not wear a uniform, was dre&s;&s;ed &s;omething like a &s;oldier; he wore a kind of travelling fur-cap, with a cockade in it, a &s;hort jacket, and a pair of gaters. Macanochy was almo&s;t as &s;trange a figure; a man upwards of fifty, of a &s;allow complexion, and &s;o highly characteri&s;|tic of his country were his cheek|bones, that it was doubtful whether he had the right u&s;e of his eyes, which &s;eemed full of &s;u&s;picion; of &s;nuff he appeared a monopolizer, the
<PB N="22" REF="29">left hand pocket of his wai&s;tcoat (as I have ob&s;erved) was full of it, and the line from that to his no&s;e totally covered with it; he was dre&s;&s;ed in a ru&s;ty, black coat, and a &s;louched hat. Flint knew not what to make of him, but was determined to obey his ma&s;ter's orders; Macanochy, finding him&s;elf repul&s;ed, drew back with &s;ur|prize; for though he was mean and &s;habby in appearance, he was not wanting in national pride. Indeed the ancient pride of the Clans was &s;o great, that a late Duke of Argyle, who&s;e name was Campbell, and who u&s;ed to treat his tenantry as the greate&s;t va&s;&s;als, rid|ing up to a gate, near which &s;at read|ing, a &s;on of one of his tenants, lately
<PB N="23" REF="30">returned from abroad, would not deign to &s;peak to him, but pointed to the gate, and made a &s;ign to him to open it. The man took no notice of this, but conti|nued reading. The Duke made a &s;e|cond &s;ignal to the &s;ame end, and finding it unattended to, cried with an imperious tone of voice. <Q>D&mdash;m you fellow, why dinna you open the yate? dinna you kenme? Open it.</Q> "Na na," retorts the other&mdash; "I am a Campbell my&s;el." But to return to my &s;tory, Macanochy finding him&s;elf repul&s;ed by Flint, &s;tarted back with &s;urpaize. <Q>An ye dinna ken Me&s;s John Macanochy,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I maun tell ye freend, that I am Minni&s;ter of the paari&s;h, and am to be treated with unco
<PB N="24" REF="31">re&s;pect.</Q> "A centinel," cries Flint, <Q>at an out-po&s;t, knows no re&s;pect of par&s;ons; if you were <HI>king,</HI> honey, of the pari&s;h, you could not pa&s;s this way without the watch-word.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In gude troth, (returns Macano|chy) if we are to a&s;k que&s;tions; in the name of St. Andrew, who, and what are you?</Q> <Q>In the name of St. Patrick, (retorts Flint) a &s;oldier, and on duty, not to be corrupted.</Q> Macanochy's patience now gave way, he laid hold of Flint's cuff, and en|deavoured to pull him a&s;ide; but Flint &s;hoved him back and pre&s;ent|ing his &s;taff at him, cryed with a voc&s;iferous voice, <Q>keep your di&s;tance,
<PB N="25" REF="32">or I will run my bayonet through you.</Q></P>
<P>Macanochy, finding a pa&s;&s;age that way impracticable, replyed with a little more coolne&s;s, and comforting him&s;elf with a favorite pinch: <Q>though <HI>your</HI> profe&s;&s;ion cheild is <HI>war, mine</HI> is <HI>peace;</HI> if I canna pa&s;s ane way, I will anither; we wonna wrangle about it, but &s;tay ye there in Gode's name, and di&s;charge your duty;</Q> and went out at another door.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE arrival of Mr. Ra&s;pe was now announced in the family: hearing that a certain Engli&s;h nobleman had placed his &s;on at Florence, under the idea of improvement, but in fact with a de&s;ign to keep him there till his boyi&s;h days were over, that he might make no improper attachment;&mdash;Mr. Ra&s;pe un|der&s;tanding this, determined to take his daughter to Florence, to throw her in
<PB N="27" REF="34">the way of this young nobleman; hoping to captivate him in a place where Eng|li&s;h beauties and good fortunes were rare. With this view he &s;et out for Scotland to fetch his daughter, and unluckily for all the parties, arrived at Campbell Hall, whil&s;t my friend Will was there.</P>
<P>This arrival, unexpected and unfore|&s;een, di&s;concerted the young folks ex|ceedingly; the old man alarmed at the appearance of a red coat, in a place, where he &s;o little expected it, and dread|ing, as well he might, that it would tend to an abortion of his &s;cheme; had &s;carce &s;et his foot in the hou&s;e, but he attack|ed his &s;i&s;ter in the following manner: <Q>So, &s;i&s;ter, you have done a pretty job
<PB N="28" REF="35">for me; you are a fine one to tru&s;t to, how I could rely upon a <HI>woman</HI> I don't know. I placed my daughter, my only child, under your care, your damned care, and prettily I am like to &s;mart for it.</Q> <Q>My good bro|ther, (returns &s;he) what is the matter, what puts you out of temper?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Matter enough, (retorts he wa&s;|pi&s;hly) have not I &s;unk all my hopes in that girl? Have I not relied on your care and good management? And pretty magagement it is! I <HI>did,</HI> &s;i&s;ter, hope, by &s;ending her to you, that &s;he would be out of all danger; free from the &s;nares that are ever laid for a good fortune, and that the time would
<PB N="29" REF="36">come, when I &s;hould find her an honour and a credit to me. But in&s;tead of this, you have admitted, nay <HI>introduced,</HI> a trumpery red-coated &s;coundrel to her, and cannot even an&s;wer for her affections not being gone.</Q> <Q>In|deed, brother, you are too &s;oon alarm|ed, (an&s;wered Mrs. Campbell) the Colonel has been a very &s;hort time here, and it is uncertain whether he will &s;tay fix hours.</Q> <Q>Six hours! (retorts he) I hate the&s;e lob&s;tering fellows. I wi&s;h I had him at Bonny, aboard one of my Guinea &s;hips, I would &s;oon tran&s;|port him to the We&s;t Indies. They are as in&s;idious as rattle|&s;nakes,
<PB N="30" REF="37">and like them, carry their venom in their tails, Six hours! &mdash; I would not tru&s;t her with him &s;ix minutes; he would poi&s;on her in <HI>half</HI> the time." I am &s;urpri&s;ed (&s;ays Mrs. Campbell) you can &s;peak &s;o di&s;re&s;pect|fully of per&s;ons of condition; your ha&s;ty ways bring you little comfort, and much le&s;s credit; the Colonel is a man of the highe&s;t honour and character, and you do him a great deal of inju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>Ra&s;pe, &s;omewhat matched, and &s;omewhat modulated peevi&s;hly told his &s;i&s;ter, there was little either of character or honour that buzzed round
<PB N="31" REF="38">a pretty girl, much more one with a good fortune; and let the Colo|nel be ever &s;o honouralbe, or ever &s;o proper a man in her opinion, he would take good care to fru&s;trate her intentions. <Q>Indeed, brother, (&s;aid &s;he) your troubles are imaginary, and if you will be filly enough to li&s;ten to every idle report that is brought you, you may have troubles indeed. The Colonel has no &s;uch thought, I am &s;ure; and if you will as readily believe me as you do others, you will find there is no foundation in any thing you have heard.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech of Mrs. Campbell's,
<PB N="32" REF="39">though it produced a very different emotion in the mind of her brother, did not produce a very different ef|fect; for his natural violence made it|&s;elf as u&s;eful to him as it could, on all occa&s;ions; for when plea&s;ed he was as loud as when angry.</P>
<P>How, how! (retorts he, with a forced laugh) no <HI>foundation!</HI> I am glad of that, glad indeed; it &s;hall be may fualt then if he lays the fir&s;t &s;tone.</P>
<P>To prevent any further altercation &s;he left him, and no &s;ooner was &s;he gone, than he was &s;uddenly acco&s;ted by Macanochy, who came bowing
<PB N="33" REF="40">low into the room, as he advanced, plying his no&s;trils alternately with &s;nuff, from the ball of his thumb, thus producing an attitude truly ridiculous.</P>
<P>Having given my readers the figure of this man, to &s;hew them the contra&s;t, it is proper I &s;hould give them &s;ome de&s;cription of Ra&s;pe. He was of a low &s;tature, reduced by the fever of his fret|ful brain, to a mo&s;t abject &s;tate of pro|portion, which the number of his years only &s;erved to heighten. When he thought proper to dre&s;s him&s;elf, (one of nature's greate&s;t curio&s;ities) it was not vanity, but from an idea, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve every thing from ru&s;t; therefore an occa&s;ional rub, and
<PB N="34" REF="41">covering up, was his &s;ub&s;titute for de|coration. He wore a &s;cratch wig, his hat was of Oliverian mould, and his coat without a collar, long in the wai&s;t, &s;hort in the &s;kirts, was of a colour, be&s;t &s;uited to hide the defects of age, and orna|mented with a double row of angular buttons.</P>
<P>Macanochy, on approaching Ra&s;pe, thus addre&s;&s;ed him: <Q>As an intimate freend of the Campbell family, I tak the liberty of introducing my&s;el to you; we have been lang expect|ing you; you are dootle&s;s enchanted with the improvement and elegance of your daughter;&mdash;oh! &s;he's a bonny la&s;&s;ie.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Sir, (retorts Ra&s;pe, with
<PB N="35" REF="42">impatience) you break in upon me, when my mind is too di&s;turbed to</Q>....<Q>Patience, my gude sir, (&s;ays Macanochy, interrupting him, and tapping him on the elbow) is a ver|tue, and its oppo&s;ite maun be a veece. It is an unco peety, therefore, you &s;hould be impatient, when patience would an&s;wer a muckle better end; (and taking another darling pinch) patience has made more conque&s;ts than many armies;&mdash;patience has got the better of the greate&s;t tyrants;&mdash; patience....</Q></P>
<P>Ra&s;pe, &s;ick of this long &s;tory of a virtue he had &s;o little in him&s;elf, and not being in the mo&s;t agreeable mood,
<PB N="36" REF="43">replyed, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you mean to try my patience&mdash;I will have no experi|ments made on me&mdash;I pre&s;ume you are a par&s;on, by your preaching?</Q> <Q>You are unco rieht, Sir, returned Macano|chy; I am minni&s;ter of the go&s;pel in this pari&s;h, my name is Macanochy, my father and grandfather, have been minni&s;ters of Fochabar, &s;ince the year 1701. I hate mony words, or I could tell ye, we can trace our family as far back, as when the great Huntly defeated</Q>....Ra&s;pe was the la&s;t per|&s;on the mini&s;ter &s;hould have fixed on, to have amu&s;ed with &s;uch long &s;tories; his mind was better &s;uited, even in his good humours, to few words, and at a time he was ready to bur&s;t with appre|hen&s;ions
<PB N="37" REF="44">from the Colonel, to be inter|rupted with &s;uch a tire&s;ome old fellow, was enough to turn his brain, he once more therefore &s;aid to Macanochy, <Q>I want none of your chronology; I hate hi&s;tory; I don't like my own; but if you know what brought the Colonel here, &s;ay it.</Q> <Q>Sure aneugh, (&s;ays Macano|chy,) I ken the Colonel, and the Colo|nel kens me; there is not a bairn in aw the Highlands, that does not ken the Reverend Mr. Macanochy, of Fochabar, (&s;trutting about and taking &s;nuff) the Colonel is a di&s;tant freend, of a Laird of a neighbouring clan, who had an uncle, a Major in India, who performed great wonders; (counting his family on his fingers)
<PB N="38" REF="45">he had another relation on his mither's &s;ide, an Admiral, who &s;ignalized him|&s;el in mony great atchievements.</Q> &mdash;<Q>What of all this? (retorts Ra&s;pe, angrily interrupting him) How came he here?</Q> <Q>Why maun, (conti|nued Macanochy, with a determined coolne&s;s) you put me oot. He has a keu&s;in married to Lord Gramont, a very gude lady. I could &s;ay mony fine things of her, but I am a maun, like your&s;el, of few words. He has another keu&s;in married to Sir Archi|bald M'Donald, of Ochiltree, who, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy</Q>....<Q>I told you, be|fore, (&s;aid Ra&s;pe, with &s;till greater impatience) I want no chronology,
<PB N="39" REF="46">and hate all hi&s;tory, but that of negro-land. What brought the Co|lonel here?</Q>&mdash;<Q>The Colonel (&s;ays Macanochy) is a haund&s;ome, gallant fallow; every &s;aul here loves him weel, maun, women, and bairns.</Q> Ra&s;pe not being able to bear his prolixity any longer, lo&s;t his temper, and &s;tamped about the room; Macanochy to make him &s;till more angry, &s;aid, with a de|gree of contemptuous coolne&s;s. <Q>If your &s;heine offend you, tak them off.</Q> "Every body in love with him!" re|turns Ra&s;pe with eagerne&s;s. <Q>Every body, (replies Macanochy) and I will tell you &s;omething that will make you very happy&mdash;he loves your daughter, and your daughter loves him.</Q>
<PB N="40" REF="47">Ra&s;pe could no longer contain him&s;elf, and this la&s;t declaration of the pa&s;&s;ive prie&s;t maddened him; he flew, he kicked, he &s;tamped abut like one frantic, and left Macanochy &s;tupified with amaze|ment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>RASPE was determined to take away his daughter the next morning, and nothing his &s;i&s;ter could &s;ay, though &s;he told him the Colonel was either going or gone, an&s;wered any purpo&s;e; he would not &s;tay in a hou&s;e &s;o unfriendly to his
<PB N="41" REF="48">wi&s;hes; indeed he had no rea&s;on to di&s;|pute his &s;i&s;ter's veracity, and when &s;he brought him word, that the Colonel had left the hou&s;e, he began to believe it; but an ill-fated accident overthrew the whole, and determined him to quit the place that very night. It happened that Mr. Ra&s;pe was lodged in the next room to Mi&s;s Campbell, divided only by a partition, in which there was a door of communication between the two rooms; in Mi&s;s Campbell's room, the young couple had occa&s;ionally met, and having &s;ettled the plan of future operations, the Colonel was ju&s;t come there to take his leave of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, when her father had ju&s;t entered the next room, in order to take off his boots; his &s;i&s;ter was with him,
<PB N="42" REF="49">rea&s;oning on the ab&s;urdity of his taking the matter up &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, and paying them &s;o &s;hort a vi&s;it&mdash;his &s;ervant, a black, whom he had ever treated with great &s;everity, was employed in draw|ing off one of his ma&s;ter's boots, as he fat in the chair, before the door that opened into Mi&s;s Campbell's apart|ment, and Mrs. Campbell was, ju&s;t then, a&s;&s;uring him the Colonel was gone, imagining that really to have been the ca&s;e&mdash; <Q>Gone, or not gone, (cries he with a loud voice) I will &s;tay no longer than to-morrow;</Q> and then, to his &s;lave&mdash;<Q>Ra&s;cal, why don't you pull the boot with more force&mdash;pull you dog, or I will be the death of you.</Q> At that in&s;tant Mi&s;s Campbell was peeping
<PB N="43" REF="50">though the key-hole of the inner room, &s;aying, Mr. Ra&s;pe was in a mon&s;trous pa&s;&s;ion, and the Colonel was taking his leave of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, and upon his knee, ki&s;&s;ing her hand with the utmo&s;t fer|vency; when the poor black, pulling the boot with more than ordinary exertion, it &s;lipped unexpectedly off, and lo&s;ing his equilibrium, fell back violently again&s;t the door, bur&s;t it open, threw Mi&s;s Campbell upon her back, and di&s;|covered the Colonel ki&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe's hand.</P>
<P>Reader, if thou can'&s;t paint to thy|&s;elf the &s;ituation of all the parties; if thou can'&s;t picture in thy fancy the di&s;appointment, the mortifica|tion,
<PB N="44" REF="51">of every one pre&s;ent; if thou can'&s;t read, in the proud looks of Mrs. Campbell, the confu&s;ion of being caught in a lie; (though an innocent one) if thou can'&s;t feel for the di&s;a&s;trous &s;itua|tion of Mi&s;s Campbell, who was thrown almo&s;t heels over head; if thou can'&s;t pity the di&s;covery of the young couple's evident declaration of love; if thou can'&s;t carry in thy mind, the horror of the black, &s;crambling to get up, and di&s;playing his large white eyes and teeth, grinning with a gha&s;tly dread of the ven|geance of his ma&s;ter; if thou can'&s;t have any conception of a wrathful old man, panic-&s;truck, and rendered mo|tionle&s;s by &s;urprize and anger, thou wilt be able to form &s;ome idea of the condi|tion
<PB N="45" REF="52">of the parties pre&s;ent. It was &s;ome moments, before either of them could recover from their &s;ituation. Ra&s;pe &s;tuck fa&s;t in his chair; the Colonel ri|veted on his knee, Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe's hand &s;till in his; Mi&s;s Campbell &s;prawling on the floor; Mrs. Campbell fixed as a &s;tatue; and the poor black trembling as for life; Ra&s;pe's eye fixed upon his &s;i&s;ter's; and his &s;i&s;ter's on his, &s;eeming to upbraid each other; the Colonel and Mi&s;s with their's fixed on the ground; paint this in your mind, and thou wilt view the &s;cene as it was. Ra&s;pe &s;pringing from his chair, flew at his daughter, and &s;eizing her by the arm, broke this awful &s;ilence, with a, <Q>Come Mi&s;s Mum, I will not lo&s;e &s;ight of you
<PB N="46" REF="53">again, we will be off to night.</Q> To Mi&s;s Campbell, he &s;aid, I am much obliged to you for your <HI>attention</HI> to my daughter; to the Colonel, <Q>I appre|hend <HI>you</HI> have lo&s;t a recruit;</Q> to his &s;i&s;ter, &s;neeringly, and imitating her manner of expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to him: <Q>the Colonel is a man of <HI>honour!</HI> damn his honour&mdash;no &s;uch <HI>intention!</HI> no <HI>foundation!</HI> Hell, fire, and furies!</Q> and thus he left them.</P>
<P>The Colonel, though a man of &s;pirit, felt the aukwardne&s;s of his &s;ituation, pitied the temper of the old man, was &s;orry for the di&s;turbance he had occa|&s;ioned, and le&s;t any thing he might &s;ay,
<PB N="47" REF="54">or any apologies he could make, might only exa&s;perate the more, and render their meeting in future more difficult, thought it be&s;t to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Ra&s;pe now began to prepare for his immediate departure, as did the Colonel for his, the next morning; but the arrangement, &amp;c. of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe and other matters, took up the whole of the evening; and there was very little likelihood of their getting away before break of day. Ra&s;pe, however, determining not to &s;leep ano|ther night in the hou&s;e, was bu&s;y in preparing for his journey.</P>
<P>The incidents of the day entirely
<PB N="48" REF="55">di&s;compo&s;ed the family, nor could they &s;it down to any regular &s;upper. Mr. Campbell, an infirm old man, had retired to his bed, and Maca|nochy, who&s;e &s;pirit of quieti&s;m no|thing could di&s;order, who felt him|&s;elf at home in whatever hou&s;e of the pari&s;h he was in, had got a &s;nack in the larder regaled him&s;elf alone with a pinch of &s;nuff, and a bottle of ale, and &s;tole away to his clo&s;et, where he was accu&s;tomed to &s;leep when at this hou&s;e. This was unknown to any of the family, who imagined he was gone; indeed, go to what hou&s;e he would, he always took his night|cap in his pocket. This clo&s;et was a rece&s;s, behind the partition of one
<PB N="49" REF="56">of the rooms, ju&s;t large enough to hold a bed, as is the cu&s;tom in Scot|land, and the &s;liding wain&s;cot was &s;o contrived, as to clo&s;e and &s;hut it in.</P>
<P>Mr. Ra&s;pe was jarring with his &s;i&s;ter the whole night, and would every now and then break out into &s;uch fits of rage, as to di&s;turb the &s;leepers. Mr. Campbell, who had &s;carcely had his fir&s;t nap, jumped out of bed during one of the&s;e noi&s;es, half a&s;leep and half awake, not conceiv|ing what it could be: he &s;lipt on his night-gown, took up his candle, and the noi&s;e increa&s;ing, &s;alled forth from his chamber, and meeting with Flint at the head of the &s;tairs: "Good
<PB N="50" REF="57">Mr. Corporal (&s;aid he) what <HI>is</HI> the matter?" <Q>O', my con&s;cience, (&s;ays Flint,) matter enough; the enemy is &s;torming the fort, and we &s;hall be all in a blaze pre&s;ently.</Q></P>
<P>This frightened Mr. Campbell more than ever, and he begged of the Cor|poral to conduct him down &s;tairs. Flint took the candle and marched in the van, the old gentleman fol|lowed clo&s;e in the rear; and as he conducted him, they pa&s;&s;ed through the room where Macanochy was clo|&s;eted; but this being in a di&s;tant part of the hou&s;e, the prie&s;t was not &s;o much di&s;turbed; they no &s;ooner how|ever, reached this room, that another
<PB N="51" REF="58">violent noi&s;e was heard, with a great clattering and ringing of bells. <Q>Lord, Lord,</Q> (cries Mr. Campbell) what a "racket!" <Q>By my fait (replies Flint,) I like this glorious rattling; it puts me in mind of the &s;torming of Trin|comalee, when the bombs flew over our heads like hail-&s;tones.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Oh! it was a joyous day your honour, and I never &s;hall forget it.</Q> More noi&s;e being heard, Mr. Campbell begged of the Corporal to go and learn the occa&s;ion of it, and &s;end up one of his &s;ervants. Being now left to him|&s;elf, with the candle in his hand, and the noi&s;e increa&s;ing, he got up to the further end of the room, near the clo&s;et, where Macanochy was in
<PB N="52" REF="59">bed, who, the noi&s;e having alarmed him, drew back the &s;liding partition &s;uddenly, and &s;itting bolt upright, ter|rified poor Mr. Campbell, who little imagined he was there.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here again repre&s;ent to my reader, as I have before done, the oddity of this &s;cene: de&s;cribe to your&s;elf, a trembling old man, with a lighted taper in his hand, in a flannel night-gown, and a white cap; and his face, through fear, as colourle&s;s as his cap, quaking as he &s;tood, imagining it was a gho&s;t in the clo&s;et; and, macanochy, with a &s;nuffy face, and a dirty night cap, tied under his chin, &s;tarting al&s;o with &s;urprize, at &s;eeing Mr. Campbell, who he little
<PB N="53" REF="60">expected to &s;ee, and whom, between &s;leeping and waking, he conceived like|wi&s;e to be an apparition: I &s;ay picture this to your imagination, and you mu&s;t &s;mile at the &s;cene: the&s;e two gha&s;tly per&s;onages, gazed for a moment in &s;ilence on each other, with horror.</P>
<P>Macanochy broke it with, <Q>Minni&s;|ters of grace defend me! Be ye a gob|lin!</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, (&s;ays his fellow gho&s;t) I am no goblin, Mr. Macanochy, I am Mr. Campbell.</Q> <Q>If you are no gob|lin, (replies the prie&s;t) how came you here, in all this &s;torm?</Q> And on Mr. Camphell's telling him, he did not know he &s;tept there, Macanochy continued, <Q>Sleep is out of the que&s;tion, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="54" REF="61">to &s;leep in &s;uch a hurricane; eats &s;creaming, women bawling, that old chield &s;tamping, bells ringing, bag|pipes blowing; and above aw, (&s;hrug|ging his &s;houlders) the troop of little black gentry, that infeit this clo&s;et, and wha hae fund their way over me, as did the Lilliputians over Gulliver, as he lay on the gra&s;s. By St. Andrew, (&s;haking him&s;elf) the wee-wee deels gnaw and devour me, as if I was a lo&s;t creature, given up to their tor|ments;&mdash;but what is aw this fre&s;h noi&s;e aboot?</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant, who at that moment en|tered, and who had not got rightly at the &s;tory, reported, that Colonel Ramble
<PB N="55" REF="62">had been caught with Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, and that there was the duce to pay about it; the&s;e words were no &s;ooner uttered, than Macanochy gathered the blanket about him, jumped out of bed, and running up to the &s;ervant with &s;urprize, cried out, <Q>Catched together! &s;ay you? It is a muckle peety, they had not my benediction fir&s;t!</Q> and, on being a&s;ked by Mr. Campbell, what good that would have done? added, <Q>wonderful gude; it is a ceremony that trans|forms veece into virture, and makes that innocent, which, without it, is held as criminal.

<P>MR. Ra&s;pe &s;et off with his daughter at day break on his journey, he purpo&s;ed to take Liverpool in his way, continue there a few weeks, till he had adju&s;ted his bu&s;ine&s;s, and then proceed on his route to London, where he would continue &s;ome time, till he had equipped his daughter with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries, as would &s;et her off to the be&s;t advantage at Florence: the
<PB N="60" REF="67">Colonel did not continue at Mr. Campbell's long after them; he &s;at off the morning following, but had planned it, with Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, that, as he &s;hould naturally be in town &s;ome weeks before her, &s;he &s;hould, on her arrival, make him immediately ac|quainted with it.</P>
<P>On reaching London (for his at|tachment to Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, had quite changed his plan of proceedings) he put up at one of tho&s;e fa&s;hionable hou&s;es, called Hotels, but where there was a common room of a&s;&s;em|bling at meals, as at Bath. He had &s;carce &s;et his foot in this Hou&s;e, but he met with an old Devon&s;hire friend,
<PB N="61" REF="68">Charles Simple. This young gentle|man with his &s;i&s;ter, was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity, upon the death of their parents, to live upon the patrimony of between two and three hundred pounds per year.</P>
<P>The father was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as many thou&s;ands, but having lived (as do the generality of fa&s;hionable men) in a &s;tyle &s;uperior to his income; the con&s;equence was, he brought up his &s;on and daughter with high no|tions of gentility, di&s;&s;ipated his for|tune, and left them little or nothing to &s;uport it, Charles, was a young man full of &s;implicity, and very ea|&s;ily led, but his &s;i&s;ter, on the con|trary,
<PB N="62" REF="69">was artful, intriguing, talka|tive, and ob&s;tinate; &s;he had &s;uch a volubility of tongue, that no rattle could equal. Like Macanochy, the Scotch Mini&s;ter, &s;he was full of her&s;elf, fond of the &s;ound of her own voice, and could &s;uffer no reply; but &s;he had not that <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> about her that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; &s;he was all fire and &s;pirit. She was a few years older than her brother, and made him believe &s;he had a &s;u|perior knowledge; told him, that if he would follow her directions, that, as he was a hand&s;ome fellow, and had re|ceived a good education, &s;he would put him in the way of making his fortune; that as their connections were in general good, and London was
<PB N="63" REF="70">the centre, where they would pro|bably meet, &s;he advi&s;ed making up a &s;um of money in the be&s;t way they could, &s;etting off for London, there trying their fortune, and tru&s;ting to the chapter of accidents.</P>
<P>They had been &s;ome time, with this view, living in &s;tyle, at this hotel, and had not only &s;pent the money they had brought with them, but had run a debt that great|ly embarra&s;&s;ed them. This was their &s;ituation, when my friend Will. Ram|ble met with them. <Q>God ble&s;s my &s;oul, Charles, (&s;aid he) I &s;hould as &s;oon have expected to have &s;een the eque&s;trian &s;tate, at

<P>MISS Simple being gone, the gentle|men were more at liberty to talk the matter over, and Charles gave my friend Will. &s;ome account of an applica|tion he had made to a money-lending Jew. Charles had a good heart, always felt for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a friend, and was the more &s;urpri&s;ed, when he found a contrary di&s;po&s;ition in others. Whil&s;t he had a guinea more than the pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion of the moment called for, he
<PB N="72" REF="79">was ever ready to accommodate a friend with the loan of it. Ramble had as good a heart, and this fellow-feeling of|ten brought them both into difficulties. I never yet, &s;aid Charles, found any of tho&s;e grateful returns, Colonel, which you have &s;o often dinged in my ears. We often meet with acquaintance ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us when we &s;tand in no need of it; but no one more backward, when we have recour&s;e to them: nay, they will de&s;ert us when we can no lon|ger entertain them; like in&s;ects they buz and flutter in the &s;un-&s;hine of pro&s;|perity, but fall off like leaves at the ap|proach of winter. My friend Will. could not; but acquie&s;ce in the&s;e &s;entiments he had &s;een but little of the world, but
<PB N="73" REF="80">&s;till had met with this ingratitude. However he enlivens the conver&s;ation. Charles related his interview with the Jew he had mentioned. I had, &s;aid he, an occa&s;ion to apply to this man, for a few hundreds, once before, and having regularly paid him the in|tere&s;t, concluded I &s;hould meet with little difficulty in getting from him the loan of 500l. more. But, added he, had you &s;een the long face he made on his introduction, you would have &s;worn he thought I as going to borrow money of him without intere&s;t. "Mor|decai, &s;aid I, I am in want of 500l. for twelve months, can you lend it to me?" On vat &s;ecurity? (returned he.) I an|&s;wered him, my own bond. Bonds,
<PB N="74" REF="81">replied he, are poor &s;ecurities, when gentlemen plead their inability to give them, and of cour&s;e are of no validity. <Q>It wa&s;h but de oder day, I lent Sir Michael Spendthrift 1500l. on his bond and &s;hudgment, and when I called on him for de intere&s;hd, he told me he wa&s;h under age, when he gave the bond, and I am no Chri&s;tian; if I did not take him, by the hardne&s;s of his features, to be forty years old! I never was more de&s;heeved in all my loife.</Q> I told him he &s;hould not be &s;o taken in by <HI>me,</HI> for I would produce him a pari&s;h-certificate of my age. His an&s;wer was: <Q>Pari&s;hes are as de&s;heetful as pari&s;hioners. I have no reliance on Chri&s;tians, or Chri&s;tian pari&s;hes. I
<PB N="75" REF="82">had rather have a good e&s;htate in my hands, than an Ea&s;t-India bond of double the value."&mdash;"But I have had money of you before, my dear Mor|dical, (&s;aid I) and why be &s;o par|ticular now?</Q> "So mo&s;h the wor&s;e," (retorted he), <Q>the more a man owes, the le&s;s able he is to pay; and I al|ways make it a rule in lending money upon per&s;honal &s;ecurity, to demand a larger premium for a &s;econd loan than the fir&s;t; the ri&s;hk being greater. If we lend a thou&s;and pounds for a premium of 100l. we alwa&s;h expect 200l. for the &s;econd thou&s;and, and &s;o in proportion. If you will give me a good mortgage at 5 per cent and thus cover the 300l. you have had; I
<PB N="76" REF="83">will lend you this 500l. for a premium of 10 per cent. and a very good bargain you will have; for money is now very &s;car&s;h, and I &s;hould not know where to borrow a thou&s;and my&s;elf, If I wanted it.</Q> It was in vain to rea&s;on this fellow into moderation, or argue with him again&s;t his own intere&s;t; I therefore gave the matter up, for not having yet mortgaged my little patri|mony, I will not do it, if I can help it. <Q>Then you &s;hall help it now, (&s;aid my friend Will,) for though I am &s;hort of ca&s;h, as I mu&s;t borrow a &s;um for my|&s;elf, I may as well borrow a little more for you. I have a &s;ecurity or two, which my father left, independent of his e&s;tate, and it may as well &s;tand
<PB N="77" REF="84">re&s;pon&s;ible for your's as for mine:</Q> <Q>I thank you, my good friend, (replied Charles,) but I cannot think of it; af|ter what I have &s;aid, it would be like begging the money.</Q> <Q>Tu&s;h, (re|plies Will, &s;miling) your &s;i&s;ter will find out &s;ome new &s;cheme of remak|ing your fortune, and then you may return it. But, joking a&s;ide, if you ne|ver pay, I &s;hall never a&s;k it. The &s;um I lend you I &s;hall con&s;ider as &s;pent, and will be more frugal in con&s;equence. I loved your father, and I am &s;ure you have a good heart; and if a man who has money, will not retrench a little, to be of u&s;e to mankind, and not occa&s;ionally part with a little, to do a friendly and a generous action, his mo|ney
<PB N="78" REF="85">is of little u&s;e to him, and he lives to little purpo&s;e.</Q> The Colonel pro|mi&s;ed to &s;ee him in a few days, and accordingly left him.</P>
<P>Charles now returned to his &s;i&s;ter, who had a new &s;cheme in her head, and was eager to communicate it, and not having told her of the Colonel's promi&s;e, &s;he attacked him with <Q>There is, brother, now but one re&s;ource left us,&mdash;neck or nothing&mdash;you mu&s;t go off with the landlord's daughter.</Q></P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the Hotel knew little but the art getting money, and of that he had ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable for|tune; in other re&s;pects he was exceeding|ly
<PB N="79" REF="86">weak, his name was Whip. He had an only child a daughter, as &s;illy and weak as him&s;elf; her mother, indeed, had a lit|tle more knowledge and fore&s;ight, but as weak men are generally mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, &s;he could do little in oppo&s;ition to her hu&s;band. The girl had a &s;mattering for mu&s;ic, and her father, thinking her won|derfully clever, indulged her in this <HI>penchant</HI> to a ridiculous exce&s;s. It was owing to his fondne&s;s for this girl, and Charles and his &s;i&s;ter having &s;ome knowledge of mu&s;ic, and taking no|tice of her, that induced the landlord to give them the credit he had done; for the&s;e people, in general, &s;oon find out the circum&s;tances of their gue&s;ts, and
<PB N="80" REF="87">never &s;uffer them to run up a long bill, unle&s;s where there is plenty of money to pay it.</P>

<P>AT this hotel there were two &s;ingular clubs, one con&s;i&s;ting of fat men and the other of lean; none were admitted into the former that weighed le&s;s than twenty &s;tone, and none into the latter that weighed more than ten; they met always on the &s;ame day, and indeed
<PB N="83" REF="90">in the &s;ame room; for the long room in this hou&s;e was divided, on this occa&s;ion, by a &s;liding partition into two; the fat club-room was called the Cormorant, that of the lean club, the Wee&s;el; the fir&s;t was furni&s;hed with elbow chairs, pipes and tobacco; the latter with little el&s;e than news-papers; for the mem|bers of the lean club, had not &s;pirit enough to indulge them&s;elves with good living, and of cour&s;e were le&s;s in the in|tere&s;t of Whip. The cormorant-club, he would ob&s;erve, was worth continuing; they eat and drank to &s;ome purpo&s;e: but the wee&s;el-club co&s;t him more in new&s;papers than all the profit he got by their welch-rabbits and &s;neakers of punch. They e&s;tabli&s;hed fines among
<PB N="84" REF="91">them&s;elves to keep them to time, and they both met at the &s;ame hour. The members of the cormorant, were true guttlers. <Q>What have you for &s;upper Dick, (&s;aid Gorger, the fir&s;t comer) to the waiter?

Dick &s;et him at ea&s;e on this head, and he

The carele&s;s ra&s;cal of a cook, did not cover the pan in which the turtle was &s;tewing, and &s;o the &s;oot fell into it.</Q> At this the whole company, to the number of 15 or 16, ro&s;e up greatly alarmed. Had the &s;tair-ca&s;e been on fire, and they had no means of e&s;cape, they could not have been more &s;o; but Bolter a little calmed them by faying "he luckily was in the kitchen enquiring after &s;upper, <Q>and having a &s;teady hand, offered his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, got off the greate&s;t part of it, and &s;aved a few mouthfuls of the green fat. What, (&s;aid Swag) will a
<PB N="89" REF="96">few mouthfuls be among &s;o many of us? Make your&s;elf ea&s;y about that,</Q> replied Bolter. <Q>Tho&s;e few mouthfuls I have &s;ecured, (patting his belly,) are &s;afe lodged here.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to give my readers a good de&s;cription of the contra&s;ted figures of the&s;e two clubs. Gorger was of mid|dle &s;tature, but the enormity of his bulk took off from his height, and though near five feet ten inches high, he did not ap|pear more than five feet. His head was very &s;mall in proportion, and was &s;tuck in &s;o low between his &s;houlders, as to have little or no neck; nor was he able to look back, without turning his whole body; this, with a pair of full &s;et eyes,
<PB N="90" REF="97">&s;tamped gluttony in his countenance. Swag was of another make, his bulk was partial, and collected it&s;elf accord|ingly. He had &s;uch a protuberance of belly, that its weight occa&s;ioned it to hang down between his knees; and not having a proper foundation to &s;upport it, was, with every motion continually on the &s;wag. He was a cheerful fellow, however, as fat men generally are, and was appointed pre&s;ident of the &s;ociety, as filling the great chair be&s;t. He has been known in a warm evening to yield a quart of liquid fat, that dropped in the cour&s;e of a few hours, from the pendant part of his belly into a pan placed between his legs. When he rode, he wore a pair of buck&s;kin breeches, who&s;e wai&s;tband
<PB N="91" REF="98">reached to his bo&s;om, which had a line of 17 buttons, and this wai&s;tcoat &s;loping off from the &s;econd button of this enor|mous wai&s;tband above, gave him a droll appearance. Others were of another ca&s;t, but equally laughable. Of the lean club, Drybones was a &s;inewy mor|tal, more like a dryed preparation of a dead mu&s;cular &s;ubject, than a living one; his joints cracked as he moved, and when he chanced to gape, it was always with fear he &s;hould not be able to clo&s;e his mouth again. He had a very &s;pare hungry countenance with hard features, truly the index of a fretful di&s;contented mind, and though he was near &s;ix feet high, he did not weigh more than nine &s;tone. Weezen was, on the other hand,
<PB N="92" REF="99">rather the &s;hadow of a man than other|wi&s;e, &s;carce reached five feet in height, and weighed under &s;ix &s;tone. His voice was &s;hrill and pining, and nature hav|ing deprived him of that fle&s;hine&s;s be|hind, that &s;eats a man at his ea&s;e, he was obliged to &s;upply its want by a thick quilting in his breeches. Hectic, was a con&s;umptive man, with high &s;harp cheek-bones, &s;o weak and tottering in his frame, that you might blow him down; a continual cough &s;uffu&s;ed his eyes with tears, and between them and his mouth, his handkerchief was always employed. The general charac|ter of the members of the fat club, was heartine&s;s, conviviality, and mirth;
<PB N="93" REF="100">that of the lean club, peevi&s;hne&s;s, ill|nature and mi&s;ery.</P>

<P>MY friend Will, had very few ac|quaintances in London but was making fre&s;h every day, and the hotel where he lodged gave him many oppor|tunities. Having little to employ him, and waiting for the arrival of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, he fell in with three or four extraordinary characters, that perhaps to a man of his ob&s;ervation and the knowledge and entertainment he drew from them, was
<PB N="94" REF="101">more than fell to his &s;hare. Among the&s;e were Mr. Spatter, Tom Rattle, Dick Dangle, Sir Lucius Vapour, Jack Lattitat, and others.</P>
<P>Spatter was a communicative prating fellow, that loved to entertain you with the chit-chat of the town. He had the <HI>entre&eacute;</HI> of every hou&s;e, and of cour&s;e knew what was doing in every fa&s;hion|able family; he would talk big with the men, and &s;mall with the women, and thus would makefree with the characters of tho&s;e he knew; and like all go&s;&s;ips, accommodate him&s;elf to all parties. In &s;hort, he was a true male go&s;&s;ip. He had promi&s;ed my friend Will, to introduce him at Brookes's; was, according to his
<PB N="95" REF="102">own account, intimate with every toni&s;h man there, and could en&s;ure a bal|lot in his favour. Brookes's was a place where Ramble was de&s;irous of admi&s;&s;ion, and relied on Spatter for an introduc|tion; one day he a&s;ked him if he had put up his name at Brookes's according to his promi&s;e. Spatter, who, by the bye, had no admi&s;&s;ion there him&s;elf, but only boa&s;ted of the honor to give him a degree of <HI>Ton,</HI> &s;carce knew how to parry this direct que&s;tion&mdash; <Q>Brookes's, my dear Colonel (&s;aid he) is not as it was. When that &s;ub&s;cription con&s;i&s;ted only of the fir&s;t characters in the kingdom, it was an honour to be &s;een among them; but &s;ince they have admitted all the riff-raff of the
<PB N="96" REF="103">town, it is di&s;reputable to be &s;een in the Society.</Q></P>
<P>To tell you a &s;ecret, I mean to withdraw my <HI>own</HI> name. <Q>Come, come, (&s;ays Ramble,) this is only a polite get off,</Q> <Q>No&mdash;upon my honor</Q> (returned Spatter)&mdash;<Q>well then, if you mu&s;t have it&mdash;I <HI>did</HI> propo&s;e you, but &s;uch is the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of men, that though you &s;tand well with the world; though the &s;ub&s;cription con|&s;i&s;ts of near 400 members; though I made all the friends I could, and that among the leading men, Lord Ran|dom, Count Trifle, Sir Jeffery Lounge, and many other; yet</Q>....Ramble out of patience with this round-about &s;tory,
<PB N="97" REF="104">&s;aw throught it, and anticipated what Spatter was unwilling to declare, by &s;ay|ing <Q>he &s;uppo&s;ed he was black-balled!</Q> <Q>even &s;o, (returns Spatter &s;hrugging) but no matter, don't be unea&s;y; I mean to quit in my&s;elf,&mdash;and if ever I put <HI>my</HI> name up a &s;econd time&mdash;they may black-ball me and welcome.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Un|ea&s;y!

(&s;ays Spatter)&mdash;</Q> <Q>Yes, rejoice, (re|turns Ramble) <HI>rejoice</HI> to learn there are four hundred men in the world, &s;o much better than my&s;elf.</Q></P>

<P>DOLLY Whip, I have ob&s;erved, had a little notion of mu&s;ic, and &s;ung prettily, which &s;he was induced to at|tend to, more than ordinary, from an opportunity it gave her of being more frequently in company with Charles

Her mother was a plain woman, but fore&s;aw the ill ef|fects it might produce, and liked nei|ther the amu&s;ement nor the company it led her into.&mdash; <Q>'Tis intolerable, Dol|ly, (&s;aid &s;he one day) to &s;ee you &s;pending half your time, drumming on that wooden box, playing the fool up and down, and acting, as you do;</Q> (for a ta&s;te for &s;inging led her al&s;o to acting, and &s;he would occa&s;ionally take off the &s;ingers on the &s;tage.) <Q>This enthu&s;i|a&s;m of your father's, in mu&s;ic, plays, and the like, mu&s;t end in his ruin; and it ill becomes a girl of your for|tune to be thus wa&s;ting your time:</Q> And on her &s;aying, in return, &s;he &s;hould like, of all things, to be an actre&s;s;

Mu&s;ic and acting, Mi&s;s Simple &s;ays, are all the mode; nothing el&s;e is talked of. The new&s;papers don't tell us, that Mi&s;s Such-a-one of ten thou&s;and pounds fortune, and Mi&s;s Such-a-one, of twenty thou&s;and, is arrived in town, or has left it; but they are continually &s;peaking of the mu&s;ical people.&mdash;Sto|race is engaged at the opera-hou&s;e; Marche&s;i is gone to Italy; Rubinelli is to &s;upply his place.

<PB N="102" REF="109">kings can make dukes, generals, and admirals, but no one can make opera|&s;ingers but the pope; I a&s;ked her how that was, but &s;he would not tell me. Now, Mamma, let me a&s;k you, whether my &s;inging does not con|&s;tantly bring a great deal of good company to our hou&s;e, that turns out to Papa's benefit?</Q>&mdash;And on the mother's &s;aying, <Q>Yes; com|pany that will ruin <HI>him,</HI> if they don't ruin <HI>you;</HI></Q> &s;he went on, <Q>They are too complai&s;ant to ruin me; you can't conceive what fine things they &s;ay to me, and are always on their knees, ki&s;&s;ing my hand, and prai&s;ing my beauty.

<P>Her mother, who had, during this long &s;peech, been indu&s;triou&s;ly darning her daughter's apron, could bear it no longer; &s;he reddened up, took her &s;pectacles off her no&s;e, and cried, <Q>Hold your non&s;en&s;e, girl, with your A's, your B's, and your C's; you may run through the whole alphabet at

<P>Such was the &s;implicity of this girl; and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee how ready a prey &s;he would become to the de&s;poiler. It was fortunate &s;he fell not into wor&s;e hands than Charles Simple. Well might Mrs. Whip upbraid her hu&s;band with his mu&s;ical infatuation; well might &s;he &s;ay to him, <Q>You are not aware of the con&s;equences; this mu|&s;ic will not only be the ruin of your daughter, but of your&s;elf; you are &s;urrounded with a parcel of &s;harpers, that eat, and drink, and live in the hou&s;e, and never think of paying.

<PB N="105" REF="112">'tis their whole bu&s;ine&s;s. There's Mi&s;s Simple has already turned her brain; &s;he is as re&s;tle&s;s as her tongue, and is too bu&s;y not to be hatching &s;ome &s;cheme or other.

<P>As Mrs. Whip fore&s;aw, the &s;nare laid for her daughter took effect, &s;he eloped a few days after, with Charles and his &s;i&s;ter, to Calais, without waiting for the Colonel's pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the young couple were there married. My friend Will enquired into the &s;e|quel,
<PB N="106" REF="113">and found it had ended as it was planned. Mrs Simple wrote to her fa|ther; the <HI>faux pas</HI> was forgiven, and Charles became ma&s;ter of her fortune. It is not every adventure that ends &s;o well.</P>

<P>SPATTER called on Will Ramble, and conveyed him to Lady Da&s;h|it's, where he was agreeably entertained.</P>
<P>This lady was the widow of Sir Barnaby Da&s;hit, a &s;ugar-baker, in Pud|ding-lane.
<PB N="107" REF="114">She was very much con|fined during the life of her hu&s;band, who&s;e whole thoughts were centered in his bu&s;ine&s;s; and thus became, what, in the city, they call a monied man; but, poor fellow, no &s;ooner was he laid in his grave, than his widow, (then between forty and fifty) became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole of his fortune, and being the daughter of a city knight; (a little more refined in his notions, and who &s;uffered his family to figure away at Pewterer's|hall; and the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, on the two high city fe&s;tivals) imbibed a &s;pirit of gentility, and &s;et out afre&s;h in life, by taking a hou&s;e at the we&s;t end of the town. She was a very vain, weak wo|man, and nothing hurt that vanity more
<PB N="108" REF="115">than the admiration, a niece of her's, by her hu&s;band's &s;ide, received from the gentlemen that vi&s;ited at her hou&s;e; for this young lady, being an orphan, was placed with Lady Da&s;hit, at the age of &s;ixteen, and continued with her after &s;he became mi&s;tre&s;s of her fortune, which amounted to thirty thou&s;and pounds in the funds. Mi&s;s Trevor, for that was her name, was an amiable young lady of great female accompli&s;h|ments, with a moderate &s;hare of beauty, and renowned for her mode&s;ty and prudent deportment.</P>
<P>Ramble, had he not lo&s;t his heart be|fore, would effectually have done it on his fir&s;t introduction at Lady Da&s;hit's;
<PB N="109" REF="116">for he often declared, had he not met with Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, and made propo&s;als of marriage to her, he &s;hould in&s;tantly have become Mi&s;s Trevor's admirer.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers &s;ay, in accounting for love at fir&s;t &s;ight, that there is a certain emanation flowing from the human heart, forming as it were an atmo&s;phere, round the frame of every individual, that, like the property of the load&s;tone, has an attractive and repellent power; and that when two of different &s;exes meet &s;o near, as to be within the circle of that emanation, this magnetic power ope|rates in a le&s;s or greater degree, and oc|ca&s;ions, what we either call love or di&s;|gu&s;t; but where &s;uch emanation of cor|re&s;ponding
<PB N="110" REF="117">re&s;ponding hearts exi&s;ts, there is a mu|tual &s;ympathy of &s;oul.&mdash;Whether this be true in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I will not &s;ay, but my friend Ramble was very much taken with Mi&s;s Trevor, and Mi&s;s Tre|vor very much &s;mitten with him:
<Q><L>And their eyes told each other</L>
<L>What neither dare name.</L></Q></P>
<P>There were a&s;&s;embled a large group of people, of almo&s;t all de&s;criptions, both men and women; among the former were Ned Saunter and Dick Dangle, of whom I &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter.</P>
<P>Not liking to play at cards, he be|came one of a &s;mall party, who was li&s;tening to an extraordinary conver&s;a|tion that took place between Lord Ran|dom
<PB N="111" REF="118">and the elder Mi&s;s Gadabout, a lady about thrity years of age, who &s;eemed to try who &s;hould have the be&s;t of the argument on a &s;ubject of gallantry. Mi&s;s Gadabout ob&s;erving to Lord Ran|dom, that he came very late; <Q>I &s;hould have been here an hour ago,&verbar;(&s;aid he) had it not been for two fooli&s;h letters, from two fooli&s;h women, which were brought me at the very moment I was &s;tepping into my carriage. I have no conception how they knew I was come to town; for I arrived only the day before.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Oh, I can tell you, (&s;aid Mi&s;s Gadabout, archly) you &s;ent to them.</Q> Lord Random did not re|ceive this rebuke with that plea&s;antry, he ought, but ill-naturedly replied,
<PB N="112" REF="119"><Q>Your remark would be a ju&s;t one, did not the ladies, in this polite age, &s;ave the gentlemen that ceremony, by tak|ing the trouble of finding out their ar|rival them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mi&s;s Gadabout's keen reply di&s;concerted Lord Random &s;o much, that he turned from her, and addre&s;&s;ed his conver&s;ation to other ladies, to whom he related &s;o many anecdotes, degrading to the &s;ex, that they mu&s;t have had more than common good temper to li&s;ten to him. Mi&s;s Gadabout was made acquainted with this, and took him to ta&s;k for it. <Q>Do you think it generous, My Lord, (&s;aid &s;he) to &s;peak &s;o lightly of, and defame the
<PB N="113" REF="120">women you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay you have loved?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Were <HI>I</HI> not indi&s;|creet, Madam, (returned his Lord&s;hip) they would be &s;o them&s;elves. Have I then no claim on their gratitude for &s;paring them the nece&s;&s;ity of it? For one woman who wi&s;hes to keep her amour a &s;ecret, there are thou|&s;ands that glory in making it public. That cen&s;ure, My Lord, (&s;aid Mi&s;s Gadabout) "is too &s;evere. Though there are women that are not virtuous, it does not follow that &s;uch women are libertines. You paint them in &s;uch bad colours that one would think they &s;urrendered as &s;oon as at|tacked.</Q>&mdash;"There are, Madam, (returned his Lord&s;hip) <Q>unluckily,
<PB N="114" REF="121">&s;o many examples in &s;upport of my opinion, that it is more ridiculous to think it fal&s;e, than ill-natured to be|lieve it true.</Q>&mdash;"As your Lord&s;hip, (retorts Mi&s;s Gadabout) <Q>&s;peaks your thoughts &s;o freely, I wonder at the folly of tho&s;e women who have placed their happine&s;s in your con&s;tancy, and tru&s;ted their fame to your di&s;cre|tion. What arts did your Lord&s;hip make u&s;e of to make &s;uch dupes of them?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Arts!

The vanity of the women, Madam, has been my con|&s;tant friend. Through this, and this
<PB N="115" REF="122">alone, I have always found the way to their hearts. The honour of being courted by a man of gallantry and rank, is, with many, a &s;ufficient mo|tive, not even to wait the declaration of our &s;entiments.</Q> Mi&s;s Gadabout could &s;carce keep her temper, but &s;till wi&s;hed to let him down in the eyes of tho&s;e who were li&s;tening to the conver|&s;ation. She told his Lord&s;hip &s;he was &s;ure, from his a&s;&s;ertions, if there was truth in them, that he could only have a&s;&s;ociated with bad company. <Q>If you make no di&s;tinction, (replied his Lord&s;hip) between then woman who has a lover, and the woman not|ed for her libertini&s;m, I will con|fe&s;s I keep only bad company; for,
<PB N="116" REF="123">among all the women of my ac|quaintance, I do not know one, who either is not, or has not been in love.</Q> <Q>Love! (cries Mi&s;s, &s;martly) How ea&s;ily you pro&s;titute that word!&mdash;Can your Lord&s;hip truly &s;ay that you have been loved, or was ever in love your|&s;elf?</Q> &mdash;<Q>I neither <HI>can,</HI> (an&s;wered he) nor <HI>will</HI> I &s;ay any &s;uch thing. Love is a pa&s;&s;ion unknown in the great world; and I do not &s;ee what we lo&s;e by being &s;trangers to it. I call love a plea&s;ure, or the art of in&s;piring de|&s;ires and of living a happy life; for the heart ought never to be laid under re&s;traints. I am always tempted to turn incon&s;tant, when I perceive a woman &s;tudies to captivate me.</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="117" REF="124"><Q>How would you behave, (a&s;ked Mi&s;s Gadabout) if you di&s;covered that the object of your love was inclined to in|fidelity?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I would, if po&s;&s;ible, (&s;aid he) be before-hand with her.</Q>&mdash;"Delightful!" (&s;aid Mi&s;s Gadabout) <Q>And yet there have been women who have thought you amiable?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I &s;hould be more &s;urprized, (returned his Lord&s;hip) fi they had not loved me for tho&s;e very defects you con|demn; e&s;pecially when they find we glory in &s;uch defects, merely to coun|tenance their whims, their caprices, and their levity. We are incon&s;tant. Are they le&s;s faithle&s;s? Do they not &s;tudy rather to create <HI>de&s;ires</HI> in the men, that <HI>e&s;teem?</HI> Reflect a moment, and you
<PB N="118" REF="125">will not find &s;ingularity either in my conduct or my manner of thinking.</Q> At this Mi&s;s Gadabout lifted up her eyes, and advi&s;ed his Lord&s;hip never to pay his addre&s;&s;es to a woman of &s;en&s;e, as he never could be happy in an at|tempt to plea&s;e her. Lord Random was even with her, for he told her with a &s;neer, that he was afraid he never &s;hould have occa&s;ion to remember her advice.</P>
<P>Lady Da&s;hit &s;eemed to ogle almo&s;t all the men, was jealous of the admira|tion paid to Mi&s;s Trevor, and made her|&s;elf truly ridiculous. Ramble being here introduced, he obtained the <HI>entr&eacute;e</HI> of the hou&s;e, become frequently a vi&s;titor, and was always well received.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="126">Spatter gave him to under&s;tand that Dangle was an admirer of Mi&s;s Trevor; but this did not &s;trike him at that time, though afterwards he was made better acquainted with it.</P>
<P>Spatter called on him the next morn|ing, to talk over the amu&s;ements of the evening before, and gave him a conci&s;e, but ill-natured hi&s;tory of all the com|pany. He &s;aid that Mi&s;s Trevor was a fine girl; that Dangle was a happy man, for he was &s;een to &s;teal out of Lady Da&s;hit's hou&s;e, one morning, at day|break, unpowdered, and in di&s;habille.

<P>SCARCE and Spatter left the room, but in came Jack Latitat, &s;pla&s;hed, and out of breath; <Q>D-mn it! (&s;ays he) I have given two of the keene&s;t blood|hounds the fine&s;t run, throught St. James's Park, imaginable; and thrown them quite off their &s;cent, after a cir|cuit of twenty minutes, in which I was but a few yards before them. I led them through the cloi&s;ters of St. James's hou&s;e, out of one court into another; &s;o from the Stable-yard into the Park again. Atthe Palace I lo&s;r &s;ight
<PB N="123" REF="130">of them, as great men there, general|ly do their followers. Had they kept me in view, into the Park again, I'd have run them hard up Con&s;titution-hill, and would have been bound to have knocked them up, before they reached the Park-gate. I keep my&s;elf in wind on purpo&s;e.&mdash;I never enjoyed a cha&s;e &s;o much in my life. It poured &s;o fa&s;t from the heavens that all the Park was in motion, &s;o that our running was not noticed.</Q>&mdash;<Q>By the embroi|dery, and &s;pangles, on your coat, (&s;aid Ramble) I &s;uppo&s;e, they were Cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e officers, in pur&s;uit of con|traband goods. You would have been a fine &s;eizure!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, I'faith! (returned Jack) not
<PB N="124" REF="131">a-bit; not a-bit; the dogs that cha&s;ed me were true blood, up to the very no&s;e of them;&mdash;nothing le&s;s than <HI>Sheriffs</HI> officers. Do you know I lodge in Spring Gardens, in the verge of the court, and when any man thinks pro|per to take out a writ again&s;t me, I &s;oon make him &s;ick of it? The&s;e fellows won't long follow a man that gives them much trouble; and I never fail to give them enough of it. When|ever I find my&s;elf be&s;et, I give the ra&s;cals a chace or two through the Parks, and they have done with me." And why all this? (replied Ramble) Your father left you a pretty fortune, enough to live hand&s;omely upon. I &s;ee no rea&s;on why you &s;hould be thus
<PB N="125" REF="132">continually running the gauntlet, and keeping your&s;elf in hot water.</Q>&mdash; <Q>Love it of all things, (retorted he) 'tis the joy of my life; be&s;ides, Will, &s;uch kind of rea&s;oning betrays in you, a want of world. You pretend to have <HI>more</HI> knowledge, and fore&s;ight into things, than other men; I tell you you have <HI>le&s;s,</HI>&mdash;a d&mdash;mned deal le&s;s.</Q> <Q>Sure, (returned Ramble) there can be no knowledge or fore&s;ight in run|ning in debt, and being afraid of a bailiff!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Not only knowledge and fore&s;ight, (replied he) my dear friend; but a great deal of prudence, and a great deal of di&s;cretion.</Q>&mdash;<Q>The de|vil's in it, (replied Ramble) warmly, if there can be any di&s;cretion in run|ning
<PB N="126" REF="133">up a debt you will never be able to pay; that will tend to the injury of your creditors, and make your own heart ach!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Ph&s;haw! Will (an|&s;wered he) that's begging the que&s;|tion. You are a bad philo&s;opher; and, of cour&s;e, a bad rea&s;oner. 'Tis <HI>want</HI> of <HI>principle</HI> that makes many men run in debt, but it is <HI>love</HI> of <HI>prin|cipal</HI> that leads me to it. May father left me twenty thou&s;and pounds. What is that to maintaina gentleman? The mo&s;t I can make of it is one thou&s;and pounds a year; a poor prin|cipal for a man to figure away with, in the&s;e expen&s;ive times! It won't half do it; and a man may as well do nothing, as do it by halves. Now,
<PB N="127" REF="134">my plan is to double my principal, by borrowing twenty thou&s;and pounds of the world, putting it out to u&s;e, and making my income <HI>two</HI> thou|&s;and a year, in&s;tead of <HI>one.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>How!&mdash;What!&mdash;It's all a paradox, (&s;aid Ramble.) "This, my dear Will, (re&s;umed he) is a proof that <HI>I</HI> have knowledge and fore&s;ight, and that <HI>you</HI> have none. For example; (and put|ting the fore finger of his right hand, with a degree of &s;elf-con&s;equence up|on, and pre&s;&s;ing gently the in&s;ide of the thumb of his left hand) with a little of that knowledge and fore&s;ight you recommend to me, you will find, by calculation, that as two and two make four, if one twenty thou&s;and pounds
<PB N="128" REF="135">produces one thou&s;and pounds a year intere&s;t, twice the &s;um will produce two thou&s;and pounds; and if I can't live upon <HI>one thou&s;and</HI> pounds a year, I may upon <HI>two.</HI></Q>&mdash;"Go on", (&s;aid Ramble, full of thought and atten|tion to his rea&s;oning. <Q>Now, (con|tinued he) this &s;econd twenty thou|&s;and pounds I am borrowing of the world.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That is to &s;ay, (interrupted Ramble) you are running in debt.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Exactly &s;o (replied he) and I am as eager to get <HI>into</HI> debt, as thou&s;ands would be to get <HI>out</HI> of it. I labour hard; &s;train every nerve; ran&s;ack my imagination; nay, &s;ometimes, con|trary to my natural di&s;po&s;ition, I u&s;e artifice, cunning, and make it my
<PB N="129" REF="136">&s;tudy to get into debt, and, for the &s;oul of me, cannot effect it. There's Dick Thoughtle&s;s, d&mdash;mn me, if he was not five thou&s;and pounds in debt before he knew where he was; but he has knowledge by in&s;tinct; and, like all the monkies of the age, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es cunning, without the art of communicating it. I have been run|ning in debt the&s;e three years, and have not been able to owe five thou|&s;and yet.&mdash;Oh, I am an un|lucky dog! Had my father brought me up a merchant, I might have got twenty thou&s;and pounds in debt in &s;ix months; but it is the misfortune of gentlemen, that, though the good-na|natured part of the world are well di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="130" REF="137">&s;ed to them, and require but little ap|lication; we are &s;uch blockheads as not to know how to apply to them. I hope, however, to accompli&s;h my pur|po&s;e before I am two years older. I was lucky enough, the other day, be|ing in good credit, to touch Bod Cork&s;crew, the hardwareman, for fifteen hundred poundsworth of Bir|mingham goods, which I have con|&s;igned to a friend in Portugal, and am to have my remittances in wine, which I &s;hall readily di&s;po&s;e of among my own friends, So you &s;ee, Will, I have a little &s;mattering for trade. Nece&s;&s;ity has no <HI>legs,</HI> &s;ay the Latin proverb, and my father little &s;tudied his &s;on's intere&s;t, when he made a
<PB N="131" REF="138">gentleman of him; for, had he put me into a good whole&s;ale bu&s;ine&s;s, with twenty thou&s;and pounds, I &s;hould have been worth a plumb before this time.</Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> of one, my dear Jack, you might have been, but, not <HI>worth</HI> one; (returned he) for no man can be worth what he cannot call his own.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I deny the conclu&s;ion. (retorted he) Every man is worth what he can make u&s;e of. The ra&s;cal without <HI>principle,</HI> is a <HI>worthle&s;s</HI> man; but the well-meaning man, with <HI>prin|cipal,</HI> is a man of <HI>worth,</HI> and there|fore a <HI>worthy</HI> man. That's logic. I fancy, my dear Will, I &s;hall beat you all hollow in argument.</Q> Though Ramble abhorred his conduct, he could
<PB N="132" REF="139">not but &s;mile at his rea&s;oning, and beg|ged him to &s;hew him, in what &s;en&s;e of the word he was a well-meaning man; for, that being the <HI>major</HI> of his argu|ment, if the <HI>major</HI> was overthrown, the conclu&s;ion was de&s;troyed. <Q>By well|meaning, (&s;aid he) is under&s;tood a man who means well. Now I accept of credit, with all the good intentions in the world, to ea&s;e the fools of their u&s;ele&s;s money, encourage trade, &s;erve my&s;elf, and do credit to my family and connexions. Every man who lends me, in this &s;tyle; charges a pro|fit proportionable to the extent of cre|dit he gives; and will never be angry with me, if he gets his money at la&s;t. If he did not thus lend it to me, he
<PB N="133" REF="140">would, perhaps, &s;quander it; but, by di&s;po&s;ing of it in the manner I thus draw it from him, if I &s;hould never be able to pay him in the cour&s;e of my life, he will find it in my trea&s;ury at my death.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Then you do not &s;quander, and di&s;&s;ipate the money you thus get upon credit? (&s;aid Ramble) Oh, Will, Will!</Q> (cried he, laying his palm of his hand gently on my friend's forehead, and &s;miling on him, with a kind of pitiable contempt) <Q>Thou do'&s;t want fore&s;ight indeed! If I &s;quandered it, I &s;hould be a <HI>worthle&s;s</HI> man, and not a man of <HI>worth.</HI> Why, I <HI>hoard</HI> it for them; I am their <HI>banker;</HI> a current of public money thus runs through my &s;hop; and, &s;urely, for
<PB N="134" REF="141">this care and attention, I have as great right to the intere&s;t of that money, as a banker has to the intere&s;t of the ca&s;h depo&s;ited in his hou&s;e.</Q> &mdash;<Q>I grant you, (returned Ramble) if, like a banker, you could return the ca&s;h when called on.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Bad rea&s;oning gain, Will. (retorted he) They do not want it back, for a great length of time. It is the long credit they give, that ju&s;tifies their enormous charges. Why does a breaches-maker charge two guineas and a half for a pair of buck&s;kin breeches, that he could, on prompt payment, afford to &s;ell for half the money? It is, becau&s;e this knave choo&s;es to lend me his money, and demands an enormous intere&s;t,
<PB N="135" REF="142">through a fear of my never returning it. Now, if I <HI>never</HI> return it, it is but the biter bit, or the fool caught in his own trap. On the contrary, if I <HI>do</HI> pay him, no matter when, at my death, or otherwi&s;e, two-thirds of his bill; I pay him, perhaps, contrary to his expectation, with an ample profit. If he receives the whole of his bill, he gets <HI>cent per cent,</HI> and has rea&s;on to revere my memory as long as he lives. Old Staytape, the Taylor, of Covent-Garden, was never worth a groat, till the death of hte fir&s;t Duke of Cumber|land; but, as &s;oon as he got the mo|ney, the Prince owed him, and which he was fearful he never &s;hould get, he lived like a Prince him&s;elf, kept his
<PB N="136" REF="143">girl, a po&s;t-chai&s;e and four, and a &s;nug box in the country, and drank claret.</Q> <Q>But there are men, Jack, (replied Ramble) that will not wait till you die. What then?</Q> &mdash; <Q>I &s;cramble through life, (&s;ay he) with &s;uch, as well as I can; and &s;top the mouth of a gaping creditor with part of his money: take up credit with B. to pay it to C. and run them occa&s;ionally up Con&s;titution-hill, till they are out of breath. Something may happen, in the chapter of accidents, to get rid of &s;uch ra&s;cals before; a good round legacy; a place at court; or a rich wife; (but this &s;hould be my la&s;t re|&s;ource) and, if di&s;appointed, after all, the forty thou&s;and pound &s;tock, at my
<PB N="137" REF="144">death, will balance the whole. Thus you &s;ee, my dear Will, that your friend Latitat, is neither &s;o di&s;&s;ipated, or &s;o <HI>worthle&s;s</HI> a being, as you are apt to conceive him; and, if he runs in debt, it is from a <HI>love</HI> of <HI>principal,</HI> as I &s;aid, and not from a <HI>want</HI> of it. What would become of the F&mdash;xs, the H&mdash;res, and Sh&mdash;ns, of the age, was it not for the good nature of the trading part of this kingdom, who are always at work for them; who make them a tender of their property, almo&s;t una&s;ked, and who are only unhappy when they do not ac|cept of it? I only wi&s;h &s;uch men could lay their hands upon their hearts, and &s;ay they borrowed it, upon the
<PB N="138" REF="145">&s;ame principle that I do.</Q> Logical, &s;ophi&s;tical, and elu&s;ive, as Jack's rea|&s;oning was, Ramble could not but ad|mire the ingenuity of it.</P>
<P>How apt are we to rea&s;on our&s;elves into the belief of things we wi&s;h; and reconcile our&s;elves, by fallacious argu|ments, to faults and errors con&s;onant to our di&s;po&s;itions. Such is the perver&s;ity of human nature, that though we wi&s;h to &s;tand well with the world, and though we covet the good opinion of tho&s;e we are acquainted with, we have not re&s;o|lution to contend with our pa&s;&s;ions, and act in a manner that we &s;hould com|mend in others; but give way to the bias of a corrupt mind, and labour to
<PB N="139" REF="146">deceive mankind by a &s;pecious colour|ing of faults. Jack's arguments were fallacious in the extreme. Fa&s;hionable young men, who run in debt, &s;quander as fa&s;t as they acquire, and put it out of their power to pur&s;ue their fir&s;t aim; but, was it even po&s;&s;ible to increa&s;e a man's income, by &s;uch modes as he talked of, it would not be only wrong, but iniquitous, &s;uch, however, is the di&s;|po&s;ition of the&s;e men, that they are no more at a lo&s;s for a pretext, to colour their ba&s;e actions, than was the wolf in the fable, who wanted to devour the lamb, on a charge that &s;he had mudded the &s;tream above him.</P>

But when her affections are fixed, a number of objects can be only a di&s;|agreeable interruption.</Q> Lady Da&s;hit, by her in&s;inuating, &s;ifting manner, drew from Mi&s;s Trevor a declaration, that &s;he lo&s;t her heart in the fir&s;t interview with Colonel Ramble, but that &s;he feared it would be attended with no good con&s;equences to her, as &s;he knew
<PB N="152" REF="159">little either of his di&s;po&s;ition, his con|nexions, or his &s;ituation in life.

<P>"Full of compliments, Mr. Spatter," &s;aid Lady Da&s;hit. <Q><HI>Compliments,</HI> Ma|dam, (an&s;wered Spatter) is only a fa&s;hionable word for untruths, an article I never deal in, as I told my Lady Bab Squeami&s;h, ju&s;t now, when I was drinking a di&s;h of cho|colate with her.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Pray, (&s;ays Lady Da&s;hit) how is her Lady&s;hip?"

<PB N="154" REF="161">&s;hould &s;ay, &s;hould injure her lady&s;hip, in your good opinion; &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a natural aver&s;ion to the male &s;ex; but this, I pre&s;ume, is merely a &s;uppo&s;ition.

I na|turally &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>you mu&s;t</HI> have heard what <HI>every one</HI> has heard, or my lips would have been locked; for it is a rule with <HI>me</HI> not to be|lieve <HI>half</HI> I hear; and what I <HI>do</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="164">believe, I am very cautious how I <HI>repeat.</HI></Q> At this the ladies could not refrain from laughing to them|&s;elves. <Q>How, Sir, (&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit) does Mr. Rattle take this?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Mr. Rattle!

<PB N="158" REF="165">her, though he never &s;aw her above twice, (here the ladies expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e) at lea&s;t he had intimated as much to me; and though he wears a cockade, if I was not ac|quainted with his <HI>tame</HI> di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;hould fear the con&s;equence would be a duel.</Q></P>
<P>Emily, &s;truck with emotion, at the&s;e words and not being able to li&s;ten to language &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful and de|rogatory to the character of a gen|tleman, &s;he was plea&s;ed to think well of; upbraided Spatter with &s;eeming to in&s;inuate a <HI>timidily</HI> in the Colonel, and &s;aid, &s;he thought his affections were
<PB N="159" REF="166">engaged; but was that not the ca&s;e, and he was warmly attached to Mi&s;s Blo&s;&s;om, though he differs in &s;enti|ments from the ra&s;h young men of the age, I believe him to be a gentleman of too much &s;pirit, not to re&s;ent an affront. Spatter, who now found he had brought him&s;elf into a difficulty, &s;tammered out, <Q>No, no, Mi&s;s Trevor, I don't &s;ay... You certainly, Ma'am, mu&s;t have mi&s;conceived me;&mdash;I would only be under&s;tood to infer, that Colo|nel Ramble is a man of gallantry, loves every pretty woman he &s;ees, and courts every girl he meets; and has too much world to draw his &s;word for any of them.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor
<PB N="160" REF="167">could not but expre&s;s her unea&s;ine&s;s at this &s;tory to Lady Da&s;hit, and was almo&s;t ready to faint.</P>
<P>Spatter expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of con|cern, was &s;orry for the confu&s;ion he had occa&s;ioned, was bu&s;y with his &s;melling|bottle, but chuckled in his &s;leeve, by having, by this emotion of Emily's, di&s;covered her &s;ecret &s;entiments of Ramble, which would furni&s;h him with a go&s;&s;iping tale for the whole week.&mdash;"So, &s;o, &s;o, &s;o, (&s;aid he to him&s;elf) Iv'e been doing mi&s;chief here, there's more in the wind, than imagined!

<PB N="161" REF="168">thought the Colonel had declared again&s;t a wi&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>The declarations of young men, like him, (an&s;wered Spatter) are little more than wind; for my part I never regard any thing he &s;ays; Ramble's a good natured fellow, but <HI>entr&eacute; nous,</HI> one of the mo&s;t idle, di&s;&s;ipated, unthinking, young men in the world. I have a great regard for him, and it hurts me exceedingly, to ob&s;erve how he goes on; though he has made a for|mal propo&s;al to Mi&s;s Blo&s;&s;om; to my certain knowledge, he is pay|ing his addre&s;&s;es to a young lady at the other end of the town.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Sir,
<PB N="162" REF="169">(&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit, warmly) the le&s;s you &s;ay of Colonel Ramble the better. Mi&s;s Trevor can't bear to hear his name mentioned.</Q></P>
<P>Spatter, &s;till at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay, the whole being rather my&s;terious to him; wi&s;hing to get at the truth, but not well knowing how, and conceiv|ing Ramble had given Mi&s;s Trevor offence, begged her pardon, for having &s;tarted &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ubject, and allowed that the Colonel was too incautious of offending.&mdash; <Q>I mu&s;t own, (continued he) that Ramble is apt to carry two faces.</Q> Here he was wrong again. Mi&s;s Trevor's eyes &s;parkled with rage; <Q>You are
<PB N="163" REF="170">the only one, Mr. Spatter, (&s;aid &s;he, with &s;ome warmth) that I ever heard &s;ay &s;o; the rever&s;e is rather his character; he is too apt to &s;peak what he thinks.</Q>&mdash;Spatter, more embarra&s;&s;ed now than ever, with a kind of confu&s;ed he&s;itation, replied, <Q>I perfectly coincide with you, Mi&s;s Trevor;&mdash;that is <HI>exactly</HI> what I mean&mdash;He carries two faces;&mdash; that is to &s;ay&mdash;a civil one to tho&s;e he is plea&s;ed to think well of, and a rough one to tho&s;e he di&s;likes.</Q> Conceiving he had now reconciled words that had before offended, he &s;trutted about the room with a &s;ort of inward triumph, and &s;elf-congratu|lation; then, turning about, added,
<PB N="164" REF="171"><Q>Well, Ladies, I'll not tre&s;pa&s;s upon you longer; if you have any com|mands to Lord Spangle, Lady Driveit, or the Mi&s;s Gadabouts, I &s;hall be proud to bear them. I &s;hall &s;ee them all in my way home.</Q> With this he took his leave, &s;aying to him&s;elf, as he hurried out, <Q>If I don't make ha&s;te, the news will reach them before I &s;hall be able to tell it.</Q></P>

<P>RAMBLE being alone one morning, at his lodgings, his chariot at the door, waiting to take him out, received an unexpected vi&s;it from Dangle, whom he had not &s;ee, &s;ince Spatter had ac|quainted him with his adventures at Mi&s;s Trevor's. <Q>You are a happy dog, Dangle, (&s;aid he) I quite envy you. Care&s;&s;ed by the men, admired by the
<PB N="166" REF="173">women, and admitted to <HI>&s;uch</HI> t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes as I would give my ears to enjoy!</Q></P>
<P><Q>What was you doing the other night, at Lady Da&s;hit's? Report &s;ays you was let out at the parlour|windown, at day-break.</Q>&mdash;<Q>My life for it, (&s;ays Dangle) that's one of Spatters lies; he's the greate&s;t liar in all We&s;tmin&s;ter, and &s;o u&s;ed to lying, that he is &s;urpri&s;ed when he catches him&s;elf at &s;peaking truth. What he knows of this bu&s;ine&s;s he had from me, he can <HI>improve</HI> a &s;tory as well as any man.</Q>&mdash;<Q>And <HI>&s;pread</HI> it too (returned Ramble): he came here full of it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="174"><Q>I wi&s;h, (&s;ays Dangle) his evil ge|nius may not bring him into &s;ome &s;crape one day or other. I was there, 'tis true, and left the hou&s;e rather late; nearer <HI>one,</HI> I believe, than twelve.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nay, it has got about, Dangle, that you was <HI>unpowdered,</HI> and in <HI>de&s;habille.</HI></Q> <Q>That is carrying the joke too far, (re|torts Dangle) They may &s;ay what they plea&s;e of <HI>me;</HI> but I cannot &s;uffer Mi&s;s Trevor's character to be trifled with.&mdash; I &s;ee, then, (replied Ramble) you <HI>can</HI> be nettled.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Emily's a lovely girl, (adds Dangle) the object of my ido|latry; and I would cut any man's throat that dare traduce her.

<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s was but ju&s;t &s;ettled, the &s;ervant announced Mr. Rattle and Mr. Saunter.&mdash;Rattle was an active, noi&s;y fellow, a buck of the fir&s;t head, and always <HI>awake;</HI> his friend Saunter was the rever&s;e, an indolent, lazy, yawning chap, ever <HI>a&s;leep;</HI> &s;o indolent, that he could &s;carce drag his legs after him.

<PB N="170" REF="177">the character of one, mu&s;t be al|ways a &s;ource of mirth to the other. <Q>I &s;aw your carriage at the door (&s;ays Rattle) and &s;hould not have broke in upon you, but to beg your company to-morrow evening, at the Shake&s;pear, where the Whig|club are to meet, and you will probably be entertained;</Q> <Q>I am a very moderate man (&s;ays Ram|ble) but have no objection to go with you, if I find my&s;elf at liberty.</Q> <Q>Why, where are you bound to (replies Rattle?)</Q> <Q>&mdash;To the hou&s;e (an&s;wered Ram|ble) of a fine woman,</Q>&mdash;<Q>By all that's great (added Rattle) had you been with me, the other night,

<PB N="172" REF="179">that the amu&s;ements there would keep you awake.</Q> <Q>That, (&s;ays Saunter) among other things, is a proof of your want of world.&mdash;No man of <HI>Ton</HI> ever goes to the The|atre, for the amu&s;ements of that Theatre.
