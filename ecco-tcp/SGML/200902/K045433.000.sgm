<HEAD>The Strait Gate, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NOW I had a &s;econd vi&s;ion of what was pa&s;&s;ing in <HI>the Valley of Tears.</HI> Methought I &s;aw again the &s;ame kind of Travellers whom I had &s;een in the former part, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Tract entitled, "Bear one another's Burthens, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the Valley of Tears," publi&s;hed for the Cheap Repo&s;itory.</NOTE> and they were wandering at large through the &s;ame va&s;t wilderne&s;s. At fir&s;t &s;etting out on his journey, each Traveller had a &s;mall lamp &s;o fixed in his bo&s;om that it &s;eemed to make a part of him&s;elf, but as this <HI>natural light</HI> did not prove to be &s;ufficient to direct them in the right way, the king of the country, in pity to their wander|ings and their blindne&s;s, out of his gracious conde|&s;cen&s;ion promi&s;ed to give the&s;e poor way-faring peo|ple an additional &s;upply of light from his own Royal Trea&s;ury. But as he did not chu&s;e to lavi&s;h his favours where there &s;eemed no di&s;po&s;ition to re|ceive them, he would not be&s;tow any of his bil on &s;uch as did not think it worth a&s;king for. <HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall have,</HI> was the rule he laid down for them. Many were prevented from a&s;king through
<PB N="4" REF="3">pride, for they thought they had light enough al|ready, preferring the feeble glimmerings of their own lamp to all the light from the king's trea&s;ury, Yet it was ob&s;erved of tho&s;e who rejected it, as thinking they had enough, that hardly any acted up to what even their own light &s;hewed them. Others were deterred from a&s;king, becau&s;e they were told that it not only pointed out the dangers and dif+ficulties of the road, but by a certain reflecting power, it turned inward on them&s;elves, and re+vealed to them ugly &s;ights in their own hearts, to which they rather cho&s;e to be blind; for tho&s;e Tra+vellers <HI>cho&s;e darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> deeds were evil.</HI> Now it was remarkable that the&s;e two properties were in&s;eparable, and that the lamp would be of little outward u&s;e, except to tho&s;e who u&s;ed it as an internal reflector. A threat and a promi&s;e al&s;o never failed to accompany the offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this light from the king, a promi&s;e that to tho&s;e who improved what they had, <HI>more &s;hould be given and a threat that from tho&s;e who did not u&s;e it wi&s;e|ly &s;hould be taken away even what they had.</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that when the road was very dange|rous, when terrors and difficultics and death be&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the faithful Traveller, then on their fervent impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tunity, the king voluntarily gave large and bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tiful &s;upplies of light, &s;uch as in common &s;ea&s;on never could have been expected; always proporti+oning the quantity given to the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e <HI>as their day was, &s;uch was their light and &s;trength.</HI></P>
<P>Though many cho&s;e to depend entirely on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> own lamp, yet it was ob&s;erved that this light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> apt to go out if left to it&s;elf.

<PB N="5" REF="4">howling through the wilderne&s;s, and indeed it was the natural tendency of that unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;|phere to extingui&s;h it, ju&s;t as you have &s;een a candle go out when expo&s;ed to the vapours and foul air of a damp room. It was a melancholy &s;ight to &s;ee multitudes of Travellers heedle&s;sly pacing on, boa&s;ting they had light enough, and de&s;pi&s;ing the offer of more. But what a&s;toni&s;hed me mo&s;t of all was, to &s;ee many, and &s;ome of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo accounted men of fir&s;t rate wit, actually bu&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n blowing out their own light, becau&s;e while any &s;park of it remained, it only &s;erved to tor|ment them, and point out things which they did not wi&s;h to &s;ee. And having once blown out their own light, they were not ea&s;y till they had blown out that of their neighbour's al&s;o; &s;o that a good part of the wilderne&s;s &s;eemed to exhibit a &s;ort of univer&s;al <HI>blindman's buff,</HI> each endeavouring to watch his neighbour, while his own voluntary blind|ne&s;s expo&s;ed him to be caught him&s;elf, &s;o that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ach was actually &s;alling into the &s;nare he was lay|ing for another, till at length, as &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the natural con&s;equence of blindne&s;s, "catch he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atch can," became the general cry, throught the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion, that there were &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thers who were bu&s;y in &s;trewing the mo&s;t gaudy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lowers over the numerous bogs, precipices, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd pit-falls, with which the wilderne&s;s abounded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd thus making danger and death look &s;o gay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat poor thoughtle&s;s creatures &s;eemed to de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght in their own de&s;truction. Tho&s;e pit-falls did not appear deep or dangerous, becau&s;e over them were rai&s;ed gay edifices with alluring names,
<PB N="6" REF="5">in which were &s;inging men and &s;inging wo|men, and dancing, and fea&s;ting, and gaming, and drinking, and jollity, and madne&s;s. But though the &s;cenery was gay, the footing was un&s;ound. The floors were full of holes, through which the un|thinking merry-makers were continually &s;inking. Some tumbled through in the middle of a &s;ong, many at the end of a fea&s;t, and though there was many a cup of intoxication wreathed with flowers, yet there was always poi&s;on at the bottom. But what mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed me was, that though no day pa&s;t over their heads in which &s;ome of tho&s;e merry|makers did not drop through, yet their lo&s;s made little impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who were left. Nay, in|&s;tead of being awakened to more circum&s;pection and &s;elf-denial by the continual dropping off of tho&s;e about them, &s;everal of them &s;eemed to borrow from thence an argument of a direct contrary ten|dency, and the very &s;hortne&s;s of the time was only urged as a rea&s;on to u&s;e it more &s;edulou&s;ly for the indulgence in &s;en&s;ual delights. <HI>Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die. Let us crown our&s;elves with ro&s;e-buds before they are withered.</HI> With the&s;e and a thou&s;and other &s;uch little mottos, the gay gar+lands of the wilderne&s;s were decorated. Some ad+mired poets were &s;et to work to put the mo&s;t cor|rupt &s;entiments into the mo&s;t harmonious tunes&punc; the&s;e were &s;ung without &s;cruple, chiefly indeed by the loo&s;er &s;ons of riot, but not &s;eldom al&s;o by the more orderly daughters of &s;obriety, who were not a&s;hamed to &s;ing to the &s;ound of in&s;truments &s;entiments &s;o corrupt and immoral, that they would have blu&s;hed to &s;peak or read them; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mu&s;ic &s;eemed to &s;anctify the corruption
<PB N="7" REF="6">e&s;pecially &s;uch as was connected with love or drinking.</P>
<P>Now I ob&s;erved that all the Travellers who had &s;o much as a &s;park of light left, &s;eemed every now and then, as they moved onwards, to ca&s;t an eye, though with very different degrees of attention, to|wards the <HI>happy land,</HI> which they were told lay at the end of their journey; but as they could not &s;ee very far forward, and as they knew there was a <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley</HI> which mu&s;t needs be cro&s;&s;ed before they could attain to the <HI>happy land,</HI> they tried to turn their attention from it as much as they could. The truth is, they were not &s;ufficiently apt to con&s;ult a map which the king had given them, and which pointed out the <HI>road</HI> to the happy land &s;o clearly, that <HI>the way-faring men though &s;imple could not err.</HI> This map al&s;o defined very correctly the boundaries of the <HI>happy land</HI> from the <HI>land of mi&s;ery,</HI> both of which lay on the other &s;ide of the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley;</HI> but &s;o many beacons and light|hou&s;es were erected, &s;o many clear and explicit di|rections furni&s;hed for avoiding the one country and attaining the other, that it was not the king's fault, if even one &s;ingle Traveller got wrong. But I am inclined to think that in &s;pite of the map, and the king's word, and his offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get them thither, that the Travellers in general did not hear|tily and truly believe after all, that there was any &s;uch country as the <HI>happy land;</HI> or at lea&s;t the pal|try and tran&s;ient plea&s;ures of the wilderne&s;s &s;o be|&s;otted them, the thoughts of the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley</HI> &s;o frightened them, that they thought they &s;hould be more comfortable by bani&s;hing all thought and foreca&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
Now I al&s;o &s;aw in my dream, that there were two roads through the wilderne&s;s, one of which every Traveller mu&s;t needs take. The fir&s;t was narrow, and difficult, and rough, but it was infallibly &s;afe, It did not admit the Traveller to &s;tray either to the right hand or the left, yet it was far from being de&s;titute of real comforts or &s;ober plea&s;ures. The other was a <HI>broad and tempting way,</HI> abounding with luxurious fruits and gaudy flowers to tempt the eye, and plea&s;e the appetite. To forget this dark valley, through which every Traveller was well a&s;|&s;ured he mu&s;t one day pa&s;s, &s;eemed indeed the ob|ject of general de&s;ire. To this grand end, all that human ingenuity could invent was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et to work. The Travellers read, and they wrote, and they painted, and they &s;ung, and they danced, and they drank as they went along, not &s;o much be|cau&s;e they all cared for the&s;e things, or had any real joy in them, as becau&s;e this re&s;tle&s;s activity &s;erved to divert their attention from ever being fixed on the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley.</HI></P>
<P>The king, who knew the thoughtle&s;s temper of the Travellers, and how apt they were to forget their journey's end, had thought of a thou&s;and lit|tle kind attentions to warn them of their dangers. And as we &s;ometimes &s;ee in our gardens written on a board in great letters, BEWARE OF SPRING GUNS &mdash;MAN TRAPS ARE SET HERE; &s;o had this king cau&s;ed to be written and &s;tuck up before the eyes of the Travellers, &s;everal like notices and cauti|ons, &s;uch as <HI>Broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truc|tion&mdash;Take heed le&s;t ye al&s;o peri&s;h&mdash;Woe to them that ri&s;e up early to drink wine. The plea&s;ures of &s;in are but for a &s;ea&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. Such were the notices di|rected to the <HI>broad-way</HI> Travellers, but they were
<PB N="9" REF="8">&s;o bu&s;ily engaged in plucking the flowers, &s;ometimes before they were blown, and in devouring the fruits, often before they were ripe, and in loading them|&s;elves with <HI>yellow clay,</HI> under the weight of which millions peri&s;hed, that they had no time &s;o much as to look at the king's directions. Many went wrong becau&s;e they preferred a merry journey to a &s;afe one, and were terrified by certain notices chiefly intended for the <HI>narrow-way</HI> Travellers, &s;uch as <HI>ye &s;hall weep and lament, but the world &s;hall re|joice;</HI> but had the&s;e fooli&s;h people allowed them|&s;elves time or patience to read to the end, which they &s;eldom would do, they would have &s;een the&s;e comfortable words added, <HI>but your &s;orrow &s;hall be turned into joy,</HI> al&s;o, <HI>your joy no man taketh from you, and they that &s;ow in tears &s;hall reap in joy.</HI></P>
<P>Now I al&s;o &s;aw in my dream, that many Travellers who had a &s;trong dread of ending at the <HI>Land of Mi&s;ery,</HI> walked up to the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> hoping that though the entrance was narrow, yet if they could once get in, the road would widen; but what was their grief, when on looking more clo&s;ely they &s;aw written on the in&s;ide <HI>narrow is the way;</HI> this made them take fright, they compared the in&s;criptions with which the whole way was lined, &s;uch as, <HI>be ye not con|formed to this world&mdash;deny your&s;elves, take up your cro&s;s,</HI> with all the tempting plea&s;ures of the wilder|ne&s;s. Some indeed recollected the fine de&s;crip|tions they had read of the <HI>Happy Land, the Golden City,</HI> and <HI>the Rivers of Plea&s;ures,</HI> and they &s;ighed: but then, tho&s;e joys were di&s;tant, and from the faintne&s;s of their light they &s;oon got to think that what was remote might be uncertain, and while the pre&s;ent good encrea&s;ed in bulk by its nearne&s;s, the di&s;tant good receded, dimini&s;hed, di&s;appeared!
<PB N="10" REF="9">Their faith failed, they would tru&s;t no farther than they could &s;ee; they drew back and got into the <HI>Broad Way,</HI> taking a common but &s;ad refuge in the number and gaiety of their companions. When the&s;e faint-hearted people, who yet had &s;et out well, turned back, their light was quite put out, and then they became wor&s;e than tho&s;e who had made no attempt to get in. "For it is impo&s;&s;ible, that is, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance."</P>
<P>A few hone&s;t humble Travellers not naturally &s;tronger than the re&s;t, but &s;trengthened by their tru&s;t in the king's word, came up by the light of of their lamps, and meekly entered in at the <HI>Strait Gate;</HI> as they advanced farther they felt le&s;s heavy, and though the way did not in reality grow wider, yet they grew reconciled to the narrowne&s;s of it, e&s;pecially when they &s;aw the walls here and there &s;tudded with certain jewels called <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>be that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> And <HI>my grace is &s;ufficient for you.</HI> Some when they were almo&s;t ready to faint, were encouraged by &s;eeing that many niches in the <HI>Narrow Way</HI> were filled with &s;tatues and pictures of Saints and Martyrs, who had borne their te&s;timony at the &s;take, that the <HI>Narrow Way</HI> was the &s;afe way; and the&s;e Tra|vellers, in&s;tead of &s;inking at the &s;ight of the painted wheel and gibbet, the &s;word and the furnace, were animated by the&s;e words written under them, <HI>tho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that wear white robes came out of great tribulation</HI> and <HI>be ye followers of tho&s;e who, through faith an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> patience, inherit the promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
In the mean time there came a great multitude of Travellers, all from <HI>Laodicea;</HI> this was the large&s;t party I had yet &s;een; the&s;e were <HI>neither hot nor cold,</HI> they would not give up future hope, they could not endure pre&s;ent pain; &s;o they contrived to de|ceive them&s;elves by fancying that they re&s;olved to keep the <HI>happy land</HI> in view, yet that there mu&s;t needs be many different ways which led to it, no doubt all equally &s;ure, without being all equally rough; &s;o they &s;et on foot little contrivances to at|tain the end without u&s;ing the means, and &s;oft|ened down the &s;pirit of the king's directions to fit them to their own practice. Sometimes they would &s;plit a direction in two, and only u&s;e that half which &s;uited them. For in&s;tance, when they met with the following rule, <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord and be doing good,</HI> they would take the fir&s;t half, and make them&s;elves ea&s;y with a general &s;ort of tru&s;t, that through the mercy of the king all would go well with them, though they them&s;elves did nothing; and on the other hand, many made &s;ure that a few good works of their own would do their bu|&s;ine&s;s, and carry them &s;afely to the <HI>happy land,</HI> though they did <HI>not</HI> tru&s;t in the Lord, nor place any faith in his word. Thus &s;ome peri&s;hed by a lazy faith, and others by a working pride. A large party of <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> now appeared, who had &s;o neglected their lamp that they did not &s;ee their way at all, though they fancied them&s;elves to be full of light; they kept up appearances &s;o well, as to delude others, and mo&s;t effectually to delude them&s;elves with a notion that they might be found in the right way at la&s;t. In this dreadful delu&s;ion they went on to the end, and till they were finally plunged in the dark valley, never di&s;covered the
<PB N="12" REF="11">horrors which awaited them on the di&s;mal &s;hore. It was remarkable that while the&s;e Phari&s;ees were often boa&s;ting how bright their light burnt, in order to get the prai&s;e of men, the humble Travellers; who&s;e &s;teady light &s;howed their good works to others, refu&s;ed all commendation, and the brighter their light &s;hined before men, &s;o much the more they in&s;i&s;ted that they ought to glorify not them|&s;elves, but <HI>their father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>'I now &s;et my&s;elf to ob&s;erve what was the particular lett, mole&s;tation, and hindrance, which ob&s;tructed particular Travellers in their endeavours to enter in at the Strait Gate. I remarked a huge portly man who &s;eemed de&s;irous of getting in, but he car|ried about him &s;uch a va&s;t provi&s;ion of bags full of gold, and had on &s;o many rich garments which &s;tuffed him out &s;o wide, that though he pu&s;hed and &s;queezed, like one who had really a mind to get in, yet he could not po&s;&s;ibly do &s;o. Then I heard a voice crying, <HI>woe to him that loadeth him&s;elf with thick clay.</HI> The poor man felt &s;omething was wrong, and even went &s;o far as to change &s;ome of his more cumber&s;ome vanities into others which &s;eemed le&s;s bulky, but &s;till he and his pack were much too wide for the gate. He would not however give up the matter &s;o ea&s;ily, but began to throw away a little of the coar&s;er part of his baggage, but &s;till I remarked that he threw away none of the vanities which lay near his heart. He tried again, but it would not do; &s;till his dimen&s;ions were too large. He now looked up and read the&s;e words, "how hardly &s;hall tho&s;e who have riches enter into the kingdom of God." The poor man &s;ighed to find that it was impo&s;&s;ible to enjoy his fill of both worlds, <HI>and went away &s;orrowing.</HI> If he ever af|terwards
<PB N="13" REF="12">ca&s;t a thought towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> it was only to regret that the road which led to it was too narrow to admit any but the meagre children of want, who were not &s;o encumbered by wealth as to be too big for the pa&s;&s;age. Had he read on he would have &s;een that <HI>with God all things are po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>Another advanced with much confidence of &s;uc|ce&s;s, for having little worldly riches or honours, the gate did not &s;eem &s;o &s;trait to him. He got to the thre&s;hold triumphantly, and &s;eemed to look back with di&s;dain on all that he was quitting. He &s;oon found, however, that he was &s;o bloated with pride, and &s;tuffed out with &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, that he could not get in. Nay, he was in a wor&s;e way than the rich man ju&s;t named; for <HI>he</HI> was wil|ling to throw away &s;ome of his outward luggage, whereas this man refu&s;ed to part with a grain of that vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e which made him too big for the way. The &s;en&s;e of his own worth &s;o &s;welled him out, that he &s;tuck fa&s;t in the <HI>gateway,</HI> and could neither get in nor out. Finding now that he mu&s;t cut off all tho&s;e big thoughts of him&s;elf if he wi&s;hed to be reduced to &s;uch a &s;ize as to pa&s;s the gate, he gave up all thoughts of it. He &s;corned that humility and &s;elf-denial which might have &s;hrunk him down to the proper dimen&s;ions; the more he in&s;i&s;ted on his own qualifications for en|trance, the more impo&s;&s;ible it became, for the big|ger he grew. Finding that he mu&s;t become quite another manner of man before he could hope to get in, he gave up the de&s;ire; and I now &s;aw that though when he &s;et his face towards the <HI>happy land</HI> he could not get an inch forward, yet the in&s;tant he made a motion to turn back into the world, his
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;peed became rapid enough, and he &s;oon got back into the <HI>broad way.</HI></P>
<P>Many, who for a time were brought down from their u&s;ual bulk by &s;ome affliction, &s;eemed to get in with ea&s;e. They now thought all their difficul|ties over, for having been &s;urfeited with the world, during their late di&s;appointment, they turn|ed their backs upon it willingly enough. A fit of &s;ickne&s;s perhaps, which is very apt to reduce, had for a time brought their bodies into &s;ubjection, &s;o that they were able ju&s;t to get in at the <HI>gateway;</HI> but as &s;oon as health and &s;pirits returned, the way grew narrower and narrower to them; they could not get on but turned &s;hort, and got back into the world. I &s;aw many attempt to enter who were &s;topt &s;hort by a large burthen of worldly cares; others by a load of idolatrous attachments; but I ob&s;erved that nothing proved a more complete bar than that va&s;t bundle of prejudices with which multitudes were loaded. Others were fatally ob|&s;tructed by loads of bad habits which they would not lay down, though they knew it prevented their entrance. Some few, however, of mo&s;t de&s;crip|tions, who had kept their light alive by craving con|&s;tant &s;upplies from the king's trea&s;ury, got through at la&s;t by a &s;trength which they felt not to be their own. One poor man, who carried the large&s;t bundle of bad habits I had &s;een, could not get on a &s;tep; he never cea&s;ed however, to implore for light enough to &s;ee where his mi&s;ery lay, he threw down one of his bundles, then another, but all to little purpo&s;e, &s;till he could not &s;tir. At la&s;t <HI>&s;triving as if in an agony</HI> (which is the true way of entering) he threw down the heavie&s;t article in his pack; this was <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> the poor fellow felt relieved at once,
<PB N="15" REF="14">his light burnt brightly and the re&s;t of his pack was as nothing.</P>
<P>Then I heard a great noi&s;e as of carpenters at work. I looked what this might be, and &s;aw many &s;turdy travellers, who finding they were too bulky to get through, took it into their heads not to re|duce them&s;elves, but to widen the gate; they hacked on this &s;ide and hewed on that; but all their hacking, and hewing, and hammering, was to no purpo&s;e, they got only their labour for their pains; it was po&s;|&s;ible they might have reduced them&s;elves, but they could not widen the way.</P>
<P>What grieved me mo&s;t was to ob&s;erve that many who had got on &s;ucce&s;sfully a good way, now &s;top|ped to re&s;t, and to admire their own progre&s;s. While they were thus valuing them&s;elves on their attain|ments, their light dimini&s;hed. While the&s;e were boa&s;ting how far they had left others behind, who had &s;et out much earlier, &s;ome &s;lower Travellers, who&s;e beginning had not been &s;o promi&s;ing, but who had walked carefully, now out&s;tripped them. The&s;e la&s;t walked, "not as though they had already at|tained; but this one thing they did, forgetting the things which were behind they pu&s;hed forward toward the mark for the prize of their high calling." The&s;e, though naturally weak; yet, <HI>by laying a&s;ide every weight,</HI> fini&s;hed the race that was &s;et before them. Tho&s;e who had kept their <HI>light burning,</HI> who <HI>were not wi&s;e in their own conceit, who laid their help on one that is mighty,</HI> who had <HI>cho&s;en to &s;uffer affliction rather than to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in,</HI> came at length to the <HI>happy land.</HI> They had indeed the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley</HI> to cro&s;s; but even there they found a <HI>rod and a &s;taff</HI> to comfort them. Their light, in&s;tead of being put out by
