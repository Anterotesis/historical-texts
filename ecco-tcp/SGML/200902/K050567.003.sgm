<HEAD>CHAP. XLV. OF SHENSTONE-GREEN PLAY-HOUSE, PANTHEON, CONCERT-ROOM AND CORNELYS; WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES.</HEAD>
<P>BUT, while the&s;e little wounds of the heart were curing, there were others of a more dangerous and malignant nature, breeding in the con&s;titution of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner had I given my per|mi&s;&s;ion, or, more properly &s;peaking, no &s;ooner had the ladies drawn from me my "&s;low leave," to e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="2" REF="8">their projects of amu&s;ement, than the greate&s;t vigour was employed to di&s;|patch the execution. By which means, the village was again covered with confu&s;ion. The ardour of the female a&s;&s;ociation was, indeed, &s;o inten&s;e, that every &s;cheme was begun at the &s;ame time, and, upon going into the <HI>Green,</HI> a few months after the fir&s;t fatal idea was &s;tarted, I had the mi&s;ery to behold the &s;udden growth of evils, very remarkably illu&s;trated. A Pan|theon, a Play-Hou&s;e, a Concert-Room, a Cornely's, and a Temple for the re|ception of ma&s;ques, were all pretty nearly in the &s;ame forwardne&s;s; and publick curio&s;ity was already &s;o much attracted, that, <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> was become the gape and &s;tare of all the
<PB N="3" REF="9">&s;urrounding countries. The children of expectation (who are ever upon the catch to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the projects of local luxury) came rolling down upon us in torrents; players, fidlers, &s;ingers, dancers, and every other in|&s;trument of voluptuous expence, &s;pread them&s;elves over the plain, and anticipated their future &s;alary. And, in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the mean time, they &s;et the women upon coaxing me out of con&s;ent to their erecting &s;everal temporary booths, to entertain the pen&s;ioners, till the more regular build|ings &s;hould be fini&s;hed. According|ly, having put refu&s;al out of my reach, I &s;hook my head, and gave up the point: &s;o that all the fooleries of a fair were now every night practi&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="10">on <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> Poor Seabrooke, grew &s;o thoroughly di&s;gu&s;ted with the&s;e doings, that he &s;carce ever went out of the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, unle&s;s, it was to lay upon the gra&s;s-plats in the garden, or &s;eek the &s;hade of the wood, by a private path: and whenever any body &s;poke on the &s;ubject, he whi&s;tled.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conceal from the reader, that Mr. Danby took a very active part in this bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;ince he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the woman, he was a great favourite with the ladies of the <HI>Green.</HI> The mind of that young man was, in truth, &s;o turned to expence and magnifi|cence; his natural &s;pirits were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive; and his imagination &s;o ex|panded, that every new idea, which
<PB N="5" REF="11">was &s;et off by gaiety, commanded his whole attention, and drove him to the la&s;t extremities. Several &s;triking in&s;tances of this appeared in the cour&s;e of carrying on the new build|ings. As the ladies had now unani|mou&s;ly cho&s;en him to be ma&s;ter of their ceremonies, and director in chief of all their plans; he thought his character at &s;take, in doing ju&s;tice to every thing that had been put under his care. To this end, he flew up from Wales to London, and from London to Paris, and &s;o down again to the <HI>Green,</HI> with almo&s;t incredible rapidity. And pre&s;ently after the&s;e excur&s;ions, we had &s;uch waggon and boat-loads full of beautiful <HI>bagatelles,</HI> which, though they co&s;t the mo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="12">&s;erious fums of money, did real ho|nour to the ta&s;te of this hand&s;ome agent, who had the art of di&s;&s;ipating &s;o very delicately, that every lady prote&s;ted it would be an honour to leave her&s;elf pennyle&s;s, rather than damp the &s;uperb choice of decora|tions, which &s;o characteri&s;ed their favourite. Can I, dear reader, con|fe&s;s to thee without a fatherly blu&s;h, that even the innocent Matilda was quite captivated with the brilliant extravagance of her accompli&s;hed Danby. The fact &s;eems to be, that women are more ea&s;ily dazzled with the qualities of &s;uch men, than they are convinced of their imprudence. The elegant &s;pirit of a Mr. Danby, though it brings ruin and de&s;olation
<PB N="7" REF="13">along with it, hath I doubt, more charms for the women, than all the punctual preci&s;ions of prudence, or the regulations of oeconomy. Ma|tilda &s;aw in this youth an excellent heart joined to a mo&s;t amiable form &mdash;She &s;aw that every action was ani|mated, and every idea grand. He had fought; he had conquered in her cau&s;e. The very nature of his <HI>ren|contre</HI> flattered her &s;elf-love. In a word, her object was lovely, and &s;he loved with all her &s;oul.</P>
<P>I was, perhaps, the only per&s;on, except the &s;teward (for Seabrooke became a reclu&s;e) who felt particu|larly the extraordinary conduct of this gentleman. Being neither blind to his virtues nor follies, I beheld
<PB N="8" REF="14">with real anxiety the great mixture of good and bad in his character, and wi&s;hed it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them, for unle&s;s that could be done I &s;huddered at the very thought of tru&s;ting him with the guardian&s;hip of Matilda's happine&s;s. His pre&s;ent habit of profu&s;ion, countenanced, and even courted as he was to in|dulge it, would have led him to im|poveri&s;h a nation in&s;tead of a village; and I therefore determined to take &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable opportunity to re|mon&s;trate with him before it might be too late.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI. BEING AS GAY AND GALLANT A CHAPTER AS ANY IN THE BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH an opportunity as I de&s;ired, however, not immediately hap|pening, I was obliged to po&s;pone my intention in regard to Mr. Danby, who, in the mean time, was running the &s;ame career, and gathering fame among&s;t the ladies, in proportion as he &s;quandered their money. I carry you, reader, from hence, into the mid&s;t of things, and de&s;ire you will con|ceive the appearance of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> no longer under the form of
<PB N="10" REF="16">a little circum&s;cribed village, but un|der that of a town, enriched by a regular Theatre, a regular Pantheon, a regular Ma&s;querade, and a regular Mu&s;ick-Room. When all the&s;e were fit for exhibition, Mr. Danby, in the triumph of his labours, which were now drawing to a period, gave a very grand ball and &s;upper in the pantheon, by way of celebrating the completion of &s;uch a clu&s;ter of mag|nificent projects. On this occa&s;ion I received a card, which invited Sea|brooke, Matilda, and my&s;elf: but Seabrooke had taken a &s;troll into the country, and told me he &s;hould whi&s;tle and wander for &s;ome days, &s;o that I had no opportunity of even &s;howing him the note, for he had &s;et
<PB N="11" REF="17">out the morning before, ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing all attendance, and taking with him one of the volumes of <HI>Shen|&s;tone,</HI> and his hazle walking-&s;tick. Though I promi&s;ed my&s;elf poor en|tertainment, Matilda per&s;uaded me to accept the invitation.</P>
<P>There is no &s;plendour of language can <HI>over-de&s;cribe</HI> the richne&s;s, nor the delicacy of this banquet, which might very properly have been given by any young monarch on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. You will draw your own inference therefore how far it was con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ituation of things at <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green!</HI> The godde&s;s of prodigality&mdash;if any &s;uch there be&mdash; &s;eemed to have laid her finger on
<PB N="12" REF="18">every part of the entertainment; and yet Mr. Danby had &s;o contrived the matter as to reconcile avarice him|&s;elf to the &s;cene, and make it impo&s;&s;i|ble to upbraid. The ball was opened by Mr. Danby and Matilda, who danced a minute with &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;i|ble grace, and &s;o much to the joy and amazement of the whole com|pany, that&mdash;pray forgive me, reader &mdash;I was quite flattered into an obil|vion of con&s;equences, and joined in the plea&s;ures of the evening as heartily as the re&s;t. Exclu&s;ively in|deed of the pride of the parent, exulting at the applau&s;es which an only child had very innocently ac|quired; there were many other things to keep up the gaity of the &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="13" REF="19">and nur&s;e that forgetfulne&s;s, which is &s;ometimes &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;ure. In about five minutes after my arri|val, a noble band of mu&s;ick put it&s;elf in order to play an occa&s;ional <HI>hymn to gratitude,</HI> which was to be &s;ung by the pen&s;ioners, and was the produc|tion of Mr. Danby. The turn, the conduct, and the &s;entiment of this little compo&s;ition, di&s;covered at once the good heart and fine genius of the author, who, while it was performing, came from his chair, and held over my head a radiant canopy, on which were di&s;played the figures of <HI>Benevo|lence</HI> and <HI>Charity.</HI> Next advanced all the female pen&s;ioners, adorned with chaplets of ro&s;es, and &s;trewed the way for the fair Matilda with
<PB N="15" REF="20">flowers. Scarce was this ceremony over, before the general joy was yet increa&s;ed by the appearance of Mr. Edward Elixir, who came into the room by a private folding door, with the machine of his wife, who &s;at therein like the image of plenty, and was drawn round the room twice in &s;tate by the apothecary, who laughed, tagged, and capered ince&s;&s;antly, till he was obliged to draw off the cara|van, and go peaceably home to his bed. But the &s;cene which &s;ucceeded this was of &s;uch a nature, and con|trived with a grace &s;o admirable, that had Mr. Danby ruined the univer&s;e that very evening, there are few rea|ders who would not pardon it, in
<PB N="14" REF="21">con&s;ideration of what is going to be told them.</P>
<P>Matilda and this young gentleman being engaged in the &s;ame plot, which both had projected, and carried on with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy, I was not prepared for the &s;urprize that I felt, on beholding Hackney Oldblade, dre&s;|&s;ed in a &s;ea-officer's new uniform, enter the room, between Mr. Henry Hewit on the one hand, and his daughter Fanny, dre&s;&s;ed in white, on the other. They were no &s;ooner come in, than Mr. Danby and Matilda walked up, and began a ceremony which they had prepared. Immedi|ately the mu&s;icians exerted their ut|mo&s;t &s;kill, in doing all po&s;&s;ible ju&s;tice
<PB N="16" REF="22">to a <HI>nuptial ode,</HI> which Mr. Danby had written, the words of which, were divinely &s;ung by Matilda. During the ode Mr. Danby &s;pread a white banner before Henry Hewit, while Matilda di&s;palayed another in honour of Fanny. Then the wreaths and garlands were entwined round their heads, and a &s;ilver label held up to the view, &s;parkling with the follow|ing in&s;cription: <HI>The New-married Couple; or, the Celebration of an Union betwixt Honour and Beauty.</HI> While the company were expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urprize at this &s;pectacle, in came the reverend Mr. Cu&s;heon (who&s;e frailty is, I tru&s;t, a good natured &s;ecret, reader, betwixt me and thee). Mr.
<PB N="17" REF="23">Cu&s;heon paid his compliments to the new-married folks, whom, it &s;eems, he had very lately attended to the altar; and they were then pre&s;ented to me by my daughter.</P>
<P>Whatever ugly whi&s;pers might have gone abroad to poor Fanny's di&s;ad|vantage, prior to this circum&s;tance, they were all effectually done away by this generous manoeuvre, in&s;omuch, that all the ladies followed the fair example of <HI>Matilda,</HI> and the gentle|men took their pattern from <HI>my</HI> be|haviour.</P>
<P>Thus was the deep-wound in the heart of our &s;oldier &s;uddenly healed up, and the honour of his family totally redeemed.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="24">It is not nece&s;&s;ary to enquire, whe|ther this re&s;pect to poor Fanny Old|blade was real or affected on the part of the ladies. We had &s;o ab&s;olutely &s;hut the lips of detraction, that the power of her opening them again, <HI>maliciou&s;ly,</HI> was taken away; and from that night, this lovely young woman, with hone&s;t Henry Hewit, lived the happie&s;t, and perhaps, the <HI>mo&s;t vir|tuous</HI> pair in the precincts of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>The evening concluded with a mor&s;el of eloquence, pronounced by Mr. Danby, on the nature of the diver&s;ions which were then about to commence, and in this di&s;cour&s;e (which might have graced the mouth of a member of the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> at his
<PB N="19" REF="25">being admitted into the French aca|demy) our young pre&s;ident &s;howed him&s;elf to be as able a rea&s;oner, and as perfect an orator as he was before known to be a man of elegance and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>At the end of his &s;peech, he adju&s;ted the times and &s;ea&s;ons for opening and &s;hutting the places of diver&s;ion, and, in &s;hort, fixed every thing on a plan, in which would be offered not only the greate&s;t variety, but in which, al&s;o, each amu&s;ement would be crowned with the <HI>eclat</HI> of the com|pany.</P>
<P>By &s;uch means Mr. Danby made one of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive evening's plea&s;ure too <HI>agreeable</HI> to admit the
<PB N="20" REF="26">obtruding idea of what it <HI>co&s;t,</HI> and, by artfully ornamenting the cau&s;e, blinded the &s;pectator, till it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to look forward to the effect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. THE GLORY OF SHENSTONE-GREEN PROMISETH TO FADE AWAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE tali&s;man, however, which bound up our &s;en&s;es, was bro|ken to pieces the very next morning, and the charm was no more. Strip|ped of her &s;parkling decorations, Folly appeared full in view, and Ju&s;tice (with &s;courges in her hand, and terrour in her eye) pur&s;ued her clo&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s began with the appear|ance of Mr. Samuel Sarca&s;m, who gave me a fre&s;h packet of papers. Every one was of tremendous length,
<PB N="22" REF="28">and the &s;um total threatened with bankruptcy or impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;tricter &s;crutiny, they ap|peared to be a bundle of claims, which were made upon certain of the pen|&s;ioners for work done, and goods furni&s;hed, to the gro&s;s amount of many thou&s;and guineas.</P>
<P>But what are the&s;e to <HI>me,</HI> Samuel &s;aid I, laying down the papers?</P>
<P>We will examine fir&s;t the premi&s;es, and then draw our inference, if your Honour plea&s;es, an&s;wered Samuel.</P>
<P>Here Samuel put on his &s;pectacles and read aloud.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="29"><HI>The &s;econd petition of the female pen|&s;ioners to their patron,</HI> SIR B. BEAUCHAMP.</P>
<P>SHOWETH,</P>
<P>THAT your petitioners do not at all doubt, but the execution of their &s;everal projects (under the &s;uperin|tendance of D. Danby, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>) has been honoured with your warme&s;t ap|probation.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> is now &s;o ex|ceedingly crouded with company (in expectation of the fir&s;t opening of the diver&s;ions) that, it is with the utmo&s;t difficulty either beds or accommoda|tions of any kind can be found; your petitioners ob&s;erve, moreover, faces and forms moving about of all
<PB N="24" REF="30">&s;orts, &s;izes, cuts, and countries, which they take to be &s;o many proofs of the great popularity the <HI>Green</HI> mu&s;t already be in.</P>
<P>THAT the uncommon <HI>improvements,</HI> made within a few months la&s;t pa&s;t, are of &s;uch a nature, as mu&s;t &s;oon give the pattern of perfection to Europe, of which <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> will be at once the glory and the &s;urprize; in con|&s;equence of which your petitioners, willing to do poetical ju&s;tice in the fulle&s;t degree, earne&s;tly recommend an immediate alteration of the <HI>name</HI> of their new <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THAT in&s;tead of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> (which &s;eems only to imply a petty piece of

To this end they offer two titles for con&s;ideration&mdash;namely, <HI>Shen&s;tone-City,</HI> or the <HI>City of Shen|&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P>THAT your petitioners beg leave to take down the figure of the late William Shen&s;tone, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> from a pede&s;tal (which they conceive di&s;graces him) in order to replace a &s;tatue to his memory, wor|thy of &s;uch an <HI>angel of a man,</HI> and to make the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> or <HI>Shen|&s;tone-City,</HI> all of a piece.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="32">THAT zealous to do every thing which may merit your applau&s;e, your peti|tioners intend ordering <HI>their poet</HI> to be ca&s;t in a mould of &s;olid &s;ilver, properly embelli&s;hed, with the emblem of a large fountain of the &s;ame metal, run|ning a &s;tream of gold at the bottom of his feet, to &s;how his unbounded genero&s;ity. Underneath the fountain we propo&s;e the following motto, taken (as Mr. Danby &s;ays) from a contem|porary poet:
<Q>Behold, the genial current of his &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>THAT your petitioners humbly beg they may be honoured with <HI>your</HI> image al&s;o, which, though already engraven upon the tablet of their hearts, they are ambitious of &s;eeing publickly ex|hibited
<PB N="27" REF="33">as a new ornament of their city. They propo&s;e to have Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, repre&s;ented in the attitude of opening his arms wide to the univer&s;e, and the fol|lowing in&s;criptions on the front of the pede&s;tal:

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. SOME OF THE FIGURES ON SHEN|STONE-GREEN DISAPPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>IT is incredible to conceive the con|fu&s;ion and the uproar which this angry me&s;&s;age produced in the village. Every creditor was up in arms, and Mr. Danby, the unfortunate pre&s;i|dent (who had been the acting mem|ber in all the buildings, and their ornaments) was obliged to take re|fuge in the hou&s;e of Hackney Old|blade, who, with &s;word in hand, guarded him from the threats of the clamourous multitude till midnight.
<PB N="34" REF="40">Matilda no &s;ooner heard of Danby's &s;ituation, than &s;he fell at my feet, and, (with an energy which could come only from the heart) begged that I would &s;acrifice her thou&s;and pounds a year to a man, who&s;e free|dom was much dearer to her than fortune, and which, &s;he &s;aid, ought to be purcha&s;ed with every thing &s;he had in the world. But, before I had time to an&s;wer this extravagant effu&s;ion of tenderne&s;s, a man ap|peared on hor&s;eback at my door, who pre&s;ented a letter to the fir&s;t &s;ervant he &s;aw, and then rode off again at full &s;peed.

<PB N="38" REF="44">him a general idea of the whole, by means of the following abridgements of each addre&s;s.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>FIRST,</LABEL> Several pen&s;ioners complained, that, they had been ill-u&s;ed by their neighbours in points either of fame or fortune, property or character; the con&s;equence of which was, either, that I mu&s;t openly countenance duels, put the law into every man's hands, with pi&s;tol and poignard, or el&s;e I mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h a Court of Ju&s;tice, in which cau&s;es &s;hould be heard and crimes puni&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>SECONDLY,</LABEL> That the &s;pirit of private gaming had ari&s;en to &s;o fatal an exce&s;s in <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> that, mo&s;t of the
<PB N="39" REF="45">pen&s;ioners had caught the contagion, and &s;ome had even mortgaged their annuities to a fellow who purcha&s;ed lives, and enriched him&s;elf by im|poveri&s;hing others; &s;o that all the practi&s;es of Change alley had travel|led down to <HI>When&s;tone-Green.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>THIRDLY,</LABEL> Bailiffs and their attendants were bu&s;y in every quarter of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> to &s;erve their &s;pecial originals and their running writs upon the bodies of in&s;olvent pen&s;ioners; &s;o that officers of ju&s;tice picked a very pretty fortune out of the pockets of the <HI>Shen&s;tonians.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>FOURTHLY,</LABEL> Executions were laid on &s;everal hou&s;es by &s;ome, who imagined furni|ture
<PB N="40" REF="46">might &s;upply the want of ready money.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>FIFTHLY,</LABEL> The actors, fiddlers, &amp;c. finding their hopes thus bla&s;ted all at once, walked over the <HI>Green,</HI> in a &s;olitary manner, and at length took them&s;elves away, very heartily cur&s;ing Sir Ben|jamin Beauchamp, and William Shen&s;tone, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as two &s;illy fellows, whom they thought to be utterly ig|norant in the ways of the world, and who had vainly attempted to &s;ubvert civil government, by realizing a parcel of incoherent chimeras too ridiculous even for blank ver&s;e, or ten &s;yllable rhyme. <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> was looked on, by the gentry, as the greate&s;t farce that ever was acted and&mdash;DAMN'D.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="41" REF="47"><LABEL>SIXTHLY.</LABEL> One of the pen&s;ioners; to wit&mdash; Alexander Spur, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> having &s;old his annuity and &s;pent all the profits, very naturally rode his own hor&s;e <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> on the Welch road, where, by very uncommon chance, he met a rich per&s;on, of whom he borrowed two hundred and ten pounds rather again&s;t the rich per&s;on's will, which occa&s;ioned his being pur&s;ued and overtaken ju&s;t as he was putting poor <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> into the &s;table: &s;o it was very &s;oon expected, that, on this &s;weet <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of a <HI>Green,</HI> a gallows would be erected for the u&s;e, fir&s;t of Mr. Alexander Spur, and then for the other pen&s;ioners as occa&s;ion offered.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="42" REF="48"><LABEL>SEVENTHLY.</LABEL> The ladies of plea&s;ure (who for|merly had the too great honour to a&s;&s;ociate with the lovely Fanny Old-blade, now Mrs. Hewit) finding every thing in <HI>their way</HI> gone to wrack and ruin, had returned to London to their &s;everal Padding-places in the mo&s;t notorious parts of that city, where they entertain all their friends with the merry and mournful <HI>Hi&s;tory of Shen&s;tone-Green;</HI> a &s;cheme, which did not <HI>take.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>EIGHTLY.</LABEL> Several petitions appeared very regularly drawn out by an attorney, who, it &s;eems, found his pre&s;ence more nece&s;&s;ary at <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> than in Chancery-lane. Among&s;t other
<PB N="43" REF="49">things appeared the following pro|po&s;als: For converting the Pantheon into a court of Equity.</ITEM>

<P>&mdash;The Concert Room into a Court of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>&mdash;The Ma&s;querade-Hall, into Dr. Commons, and&mdash;The Theatre into a Court of King's-Bench.</P>
<P>From the above account it appeared &s;o evidently, my whole project was a mere ca&s;tle in the air that I was quite di&s;pirited. Then there is not a folly of <HI>any kind,</HI> Samuel, &s;aid I, which does not at this time flouri&s;h upon <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> Pray, Samuel, what
<PB N="44" REF="50">is your opinion of all the&s;e fine doings?</P>
<P>That it is the Hi&s;tory of poor <HI>Human Nature</HI> &s;poiled by <HI>human art,</HI> when both are left at large to their own inventions, an't plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid the &s;teward.</P>
<P>But my village, Mr. Sarca&s;m, is ten times wor&s;e than any other &s;pot in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, an't plea&s;e your Honour, every other &s;pot in Chri&s;tendom but your village, is regulated by laws penal; whereas, <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> is builded and conducted wholly upon a <HI>poetical model.</HI> Your's, &s;ir, is fairy land; <HI>we are</HI> obliged to go to the next town for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">Here the &s;udden entrance of one of the pen&s;ioners (who delivered me a petition on his knee with a grave air, and then withdrew) put a &s;top to the &s;teward's ob&s;ervations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L. THE WHISTLER EXALTS HIS VOICE IN THIS CHAPTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;teward had &s;carcely &s;tepped over the thre&s;hold, when my old and excellent friend Mr. Seabrooke (be&s;prent with du&s;t, and burni&s;hed by the tan of that &s;un, upon which he &s;o much doated) made his appear|ance.</P>
<P>I ran to him with that ardour, which denotes an affection founded upon a long experience of admirable qualities&mdash;qualities which his inno|cent
<PB N="50" REF="56">oddities &s;erved only to render the more endearing.</P>
<P>He &s;hook me heartily by the hand, and then whi&s;tled his loude&s;t note to &s;ummon Matilda, who, however, was indi&s;po&s;ed in her chamber; &s;he was indeed, too ill to &s;tir from her apart|ment; &s;o, without any more ceremony, Seabrooke took two or three &s;trides up the &s;tairs, and was &s;oon dandling his little favourite in his arms, and a&s;king all the tender que&s;tions that could po&s;&s;ibly come from a man of his tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But Matilda came and a&s;ked me &s;oftly, if Mr. Danby was at liberty?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57">I &s;aid (in the &s;ame under-tone of voice) that, he <HI>was:</HI> upon which the poor girl caught &s;uch &s;pirits, that &s;he ran to Seabrooke, and chided him for his cruel excur&s;ion, at a time too, &s;aid &s;he, when I wanted my old play|fellow more than ever I did in my life; and &s;uch &s;unny weather too!</P>
<P>Then let us have all our different adventures, &s;ince parting, related over a di&s;h of good tea, &s;aid Seabrooke. <HI>Whew&mdash; quick&mdash; Whew&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>In the bow-window if you plea&s;e, papa, which looks towards <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green;</HI> becau&s;e then, you know, if any per&s;on &s;hould happen to come, we &s;hall all be ready to receive him, and fetch a cup in a moment.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="58">The idea of Danby's freedom, had &s;o well recovered her, that &s;he trip|ped down &s;tairs as agil as a hare, and the tea-equipage was prepared with|out delay.</P>
<P>I took the lead in the pre&s;ent con|ver&s;ation, and circum&s;tantially related (without any other re&s;erve than that of concealing Mr. Danby's name) every tran&s;action that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince, Mr. Seabrooke &s;et off on his ramble.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this lamentable account, Seabrooke gave a long whi&s;|tle, and &s;aid, with an empha&s;is highly marked that, he was now convinced of what he had before &s;u&s;pected. <HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;&s;aid he,&mdash;'tis now clear: 'tis ab&s;olute &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59">I de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend|&s;hip, &s;howing, very pathetically (by a fear which then flowed from my heart to his hand, that I was as deeply <HI>affected</HI> as <HI>deceived).</HI></P>
<P>Matilda ran &s;oftly on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to ki&s;s my cheek, and Mr. Sea|brooke addre&s;&s;ed me thus: Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, you are, I find, a man to be <HI>looked at,</HI> but not <HI>followed.</HI> As &s;oon as I heard of your project, I came to &s;ee how human nature would behave, under the exe|cution of &s;uch a whim. In Glamor|gan&s;hire (&s;aid I to my&s;elf, upon read|ing your plan) re&s;ides a man whom I would travel &s;even times &s;even over the Alps, in the dead of winter to
<PB N="54" REF="60">know: his heart mu&s;t be the noble&s;t in the world. Accordingly, I travelled on foot to <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> where, I found your di&s;po&s;ition even greater than I imagined, and I re&s;olved to pa&s;s &s;ome time with you in <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> But a very few days elap&s;ed before I was obliged to &s;tretch my&s;elf on the gra&s;s-plats in the eye of the &s;un, that I might not &s;ee too much of my fel|low-creatures. I every hour remarked that <HI>modern man,</HI> without the rod often &s;naken over his head, and the whip &s;macked in his ear, was as an hor&s;e of &s;pirit without any bridle. The poor animals whom&mdash;to carry on the allu&s;ion&mdash;you had taken from the barren heath (where they were &s;tarving upon thi&s;tles) to place, of a
<PB N="55" REF="61">&s;udden, in the luxuriant pa&s;ture, where the corn and gra&s;s came mantling to their che&s;ts&mdash;were turned too rapidly loo&s;e to become &s;teady. They fir&s;t grew fat, then indolent, next re&s;tive, and la&s;t <HI>vicious.</HI> I heard them &s;nort di&s;dain; and I &s;aw them lift the hoof again&s;t the very benefactor, who put on their &s;hoes, and gave the vigour to kick. Yet I pitied rather than blamed: I con&s;idered whether this was pure ba&s;ene&s;s, or the inevitable con&s;equence of &s;ituation, operating on peculiar temperament and character. &mdash;<HI>Too happy</HI> creatures &s;aid I, <HI>are</HI> the&s;e &s;teeds of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp; for which rea&s;on they mu&s;t <HI>&s;oon</HI> be <HI>too mi&s;erable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">Had they been timely broken to the bit, and taught an early obedi|ence to the curb: had they been put into proper training, there is no mo|tive to &s;uppo&s;e they would not have been mo&s;t of them &s;erviceable animals &mdash;and&mdash;</P>
<P>Does nothing then but rigid di&s;ci|pline create virtue, &s;aid I, Mr. Sea|brooke?</P>
<P>No, replied Seabrooke, di&s;cipline hath no influence over Henry Hewit, Hackney. Oldblade, Matilda Beau|champ, nor &s;ome other per&s;ons of our acquaintance. Good and gentle cha|racters, require no other impul&s;e to virtue than the dictate of the heart, which is their unerring rule of right;
<PB N="57" REF="63">but the majority, being neither gentle not good; it is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the force of bad habit or bad nature, by the interpo&s;ition of whole&s;ome laws. But in <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> none of the&s;e could be e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;i&s;t|ently with the proprietor's <HI>delicacy.</HI></P>
<P>You have <HI>&s;een,</HI> you have <HI>felt</HI> the con&s;equence, Sir Benjamin.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LI. IN WHICH THE WHISLER'S PIPE IS PARTICULARLY IN TUNE.</HEAD>
<P>HURT, and di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;eeing how impo&s;&s;ible it is to leave human beings to their own di&s;cretion, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, and really concerned &s;o early to perceive, the ab&s;olute madne&s;s of e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of pure obligation and benevo|lence on the one hand, and of grati|tude on the other, I wanted yet to try, if there was no way for a man to be liberal without doing at the &s;ame
<PB N="59" REF="65">time as much harm as good. Two or three days did I contemplate this &s;ubject, as I lay in the &s;un upon your gra&s;s-plats, my friend; and, at length, an idea came acro&s;s, which &s;et me upon my legs to &s;ome purpo&s;e: for, I have mea&s;ured near &s;ixty miles, in my &s;auntering way, Sir Benjamin, &s;ince I left the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, and now I am returned thoroughly &s;atisfied, that I can <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> our friend <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> in every part of his &s;cheme. Nay I am, at this time, able to &s;et one of his ob&s;ervations again&s;t another. Pray compare <HI>that</HI> notion of his from whence you took your hint, and which was, indeed, the foundation of the village, with what follows:
<PB N="60" REF="66"><Q>I have been formerly &s;o &s;illy as to hope (&s;ays our poet in one of his egoti&s;ms) that every &s;ervant I had might be made a friend; I am now convinced, that the nature of &s;ervitude bears a <HI>contrary</HI> tendency. It is the nature of &s;ervitude al&s;o, to di&s;card all <HI>generous</HI> motives to obe|dience; and to point out no other, than tho&s;e &s;coundrel ones of intere&s;t and fear.</Q></P>
<P>Now, take my word for it, con|tinued, Mr. Seabrooke, that, all pen|&s;ions upon the <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> principle, are <HI>too generou&s;ly</HI> and <HI>too largely</HI> be&s;towed, not to reduce the per&s;on thereby benefitted to a &s;tate of &s;lavery and <HI>obligation,</HI> which (unle&s;s &s;uch per&s;on
<PB N="61" REF="67">happens to have the heart of a Henry Hewit) mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, introduce idlene&s;s, which will beget voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, which will terminate in vice.</P>
<P>Had we been convinced of the&s;e facts &s;ome time ago, Mr. Seabrooke, &s;aid I, how many pangs of heart, as well as pur&s;es of &s;olid gold might have been &s;pared.</P>
<P>I was not clear in the point my&s;elf, an&s;wered Seabrooke, till I had more particularly proved it in my late ex|cur&s;ion; of which I will now give <HI>you</HI> and Matilda an account. He pau&s;ed, and then went on.</P>
<P>As I gra&s;ped my hazle-&s;tick on the morning of my departure, &s;urely, &s;aid
<PB N="62" REF="68">I, it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to be at once wi&s;e and generous. Let us &s;ee. To this purpo&s;e, I bent my way over the mountains, re&s;olved to &s;top at every hut or hamlet that &s;hould ri&s;e up in the road. My &s;cheme was to do what, I fear, the <HI>Shen&s;tonian</HI> plan does not permit&mdash;namely, to try the worth of my object <HI>before</HI> I admi|ni&s;tred relief. Pigmy as I am, I &s;tood upon the galled &s;houlders of that giant of genero&s;ity, Sir Benjamin, and &s;o &s;aw farther. To forward this my &s;tratagem, I tore off a corner of my hat, as you &s;ee, to make my&s;elf look properly mi&s;erable; I cut a couple of &s;lits in my &s;hoes, picked a few holes in the mo&s;t obvious parts of my coat,
<PB N="63" REF="69">taking care that the buttons &s;hould, in &s;everal places be wanting&mdash;becau&s;e there is nothing more denotes penury, than the di&s;appearance of a button, particularly, if the old threads are &s;uffered to hang about&mdash;and &s;haking the powder out of my wig (which you know has not been acquainted with combs, &s;ince I came into your poetical country) &s;allied into the poore&s;t part of Wales, under pretence of being the poore&s;t fellow in it. Thus accoutered, I entered every cottage, who&s;e mud walls were either bleaching on the hills, or &s;kulking among&s;t the vallies. I knocked with|out ceremony at every door, and often let my&s;elf in by means of a latch. Without the lea&s;t ceremony I took a
<PB N="64" REF="70">chair, or (if chairs were &s;carce) a &s;tool, and &s;et my&s;elf down with the family. If they were at dinner, I dined al&s;o; if they were at work, I joined in the bu&s;tle, and would take mop or broom out of the dam&s;el's hand without &s;ay|ing a &s;yllable. You know, Matilda, what a proud odd &s;ort of &s;aucy beg|gar I am. It will be impo&s;&s;ible to tell you half the &s;ingular events, which trod upon the heel of this &s;ingular conduct.&mdash;Some thought I was mad, others merry. Some be|lieved I was a conjurer, others an impo&s;tor. What of that, I had my plan before me, and I pur&s;ued it without deviation. Whether I was well or ill treated, I &s;tayed always long enough to find out the hi&s;tory
<PB N="65" REF="71">of the hut; its misfortunes, its pro|&s;perities. Hence, the characters of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were developed of cour&s;e. Sometimes I have entered a wretched-looked cottage (where penury &s;eemed to &s;it &s;taring in a u&s;e|le&s;s chimney-corner without a faggot to call the blood into her fingers) and I have, on enquiry, found, the inhabitants &s;o rich in content, that I dared not venture to leave with them more than half a crown or at mo&s;t five &s;hillings, for fear I &s;hould over|whelm them with &s;udden indepen|dence, and &s;o ruin the family. Had I left a whole guinea in &s;uch a hut, the pro&s;perity would have been &s;o great, that four girls who were then &s;inging at their wheels, would not
<PB N="66" REF="72">have returned to &s;pinning till idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation had made them almo&s;t forget how to wind the wool round their lazy fingers. At other times I have gone into a hou&s;e, where, by the diligence of the cottagers, all &s;orts of penury &s;eemed to be bani&s;hed; where the floor was nicely &s;anded, the pewter &s;hone like mirrours, and the goodly rows of crockery, mended at top and bottom, garni&s;hed the chimney-piece; and yet, before I took my leave, I have found the family &s;o <HI>truly</HI> poor, and &s;o ab&s;olutely <HI>prudent,</HI> that it might be tru&s;ted with the enormous &s;um of five pounds, although it came pouring upon them in a <HI>&s;udden</HI> &s;hower of gold. Such a &s;um <HI>did</HI> I give to &s;uch a family, Sir Benjamin, and
<PB N="67" REF="73">what rea&s;on have I (more than you yet know) think you, to a&s;&s;ure my|&s;elf my bounty was well-placed? Why, you &s;hall hear. I took out the money ju&s;t after we had been banquetting on &s;ome excellent pota|toes without butter, and as &s;oon as I had told the five pounds&mdash;guineas, in fact, I ought to &s;ay&mdash;<HI>here</HI> (&s;aid I, to a good woman who &s;at oppo&s;ite) the&s;e are to pay you for &s;ome of the be&s;t potatoes dre&s;&s;ed in the nice&s;t way, and &s;erved up in the cleane&s;t manner I ever &s;aw. As I chucked the ca&s;h acro&s;s the table, one of the guineas tumbled on a farthing platter and broke it in two. After curte&s;ying, many times too often, and putting the money into her pocket, &s;he gave
<PB N="68" REF="74">the broken plate to her hu&s;band and &s;aid&mdash;here Robin&mdash;a farthing is a farthing, and the good gentleman has &mdash;God ble&s;s him&mdash;given us five gui|neas; that is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould grow more extravagant than u&s;ual, &s;o pray, Robin, mend the platter. This, Robin, who was the family mechanick, did in a very little time; and at night it bore the weight of the potatoes, warmed up a &s;econd time, as well as ever. I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, though, that &s;ometimes I have made my pa&s;&s;age into huts, through all the &s;aucine&s;s and brutality that was ever practi&s;ed, even by the pampered children of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Creen.</HI> I have met fellows that would neither &s;uffer me to &s;it upon &s;tool or chair;
<PB N="69" REF="75">who have oppo&s;ed my entering into any conver&s;ation, and refu&s;ed to give me a cru&s;t when I affected to be in the mi&s;ery which my appearance ju&s;|tified. But, having authority in my hand, I always in &s;uch ca&s;es, <HI>i. e,</HI> after I found them reprobate&mdash;put my hand quietly into my pocket, and then took from my pur&s;e eight or ten guineas under pretence of wanting change: then, having thoroughly opened every mouth with wonder, and &s;ilenced every tongue with &s;hame, I was generous enough to give the ungrateful ra&s;cals a WHISTLE and &s;et off for fre&s;h adventures.</P>
<P>Matilda here leaped on Mr. Sea|brooke's knee, and ki&s;&s;ed him with all her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">Mr. Elixir (whom I forgot to tell the reader, had come into the room ju&s;t as the tea-kettle was brought) cried, laughed, &s;kipped, and bounded at Mr. Seabrooke's relation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIII. A MORE INTERESTING DISCOVERY THAN COULD BE IMAGINED.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this account Mr. Seabrooke, &s;aid I, it appears that, with the &s;mall &s;um of one year's payment of your pen&s;ion&mdash;nay, &s;carce the half of it, you have done more rational and more real &s;ervice to &s;ociety than poor &s;illy Sir Benjamin Beauchamp with all his thou&s;and pounds, and fair &s;now of <HI>Shen&s;tonian</HI> hou&s;es and the annuity &s;ettled upon their inhabi|tants.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="86">Before any an&s;wer or remark could be made upon this reflexion, a &s;ervant opened the door of our apartment, to introduce, under cover of the night (which was then come on) a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a di&s;gui&s;e, a man who fell at my feet the moment he could reach me.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the di&s;gui&s;ed per&s;on, I cannot re&s;t till I have per&s;onally de|manded pardon for the&mdash;</P>
<P>Gracious Providence, exclaimed Seabrooke, in the mo&s;t violent emo|tion &mdash;that voice &s;hould belong to&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Danby&mdash;cried Matilda.</P>
<P><HI>Danby</HI>&mdash;an&s;wered Seabrooke with perfect amazement&mdash;yes&mdash;it may be &s;o&mdash;that may perhaps be the name which&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="87">I have taken upon me (&s;aid the man) to conceal the faults which di&s;|graced the family of&mdash;</P>
<P>Whom! (cried Seabrooke, &s;tagger|ing again&s;t the wain&s;cot) the family of whom?&mdash;</P>
<P>Of Sir Matthew Davies, replied the gentleman, unmuffling his face, and di&s;covering Mr. Danby.</P>
<P>My <HI>nephew</HI> here, cried Seabrooke, by what accident is he ari&s;en from the dead?</P>
<P>The dead! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Your nephew! Mr. Seabrooke, de|manded Matilda? Your nephew, Mr. Seabrooke, did you &s;ay?</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88">Call me not Seabrooke any more, madam; I am that unhappy Sir Matthew Davies, who fed and nur&s;ed that <HI>fictitious</HI> Danby upon my knee, when his parents were in their graves; but his extravagant benevolence drove him from my arms to &s;ome foreign &s;hore, where it was afterwards reported he died. Speak, Danvers Davies, am I not relating facts?</P>
<P>They are too true, an&s;wered the young man; I had committed exce&s;&s;es which I deemed impo&s;&s;ible for you to forgive, and, that I might never be thought of more, determined to ab&s;cond for ever, and feigned my&s;elf dead.</P>
<P>Since which time, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Sir Matthew, you have been more prudent.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89">Not a whit, &s;ir, replied young Da|vies. This gentleman can tell you that I have been the mo&s;t prodigal, mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>Fie! &s;ir, &s;aid Matilda half drowned in her tears, it's no &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>This gentleman's bounty, &s;ir, found me in the retreat I had &s;ought to hide my&s;elf, and he took me under his protection upon the credit of &s;ome good feelings, and in pity to many weakne&s;&s;es. But &s;carce was I put in|to <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> before my unfortunate pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;</P>
<P>Lookee, Danvers, an&s;wered Sir Matthew, that you are a mixture of weeds and flowers I do not want to be told; nor do I de&s;ire to hear the hi&s;|tory
<PB N="84" REF="90">of half the mad things you have committed, or by what multiplied &s;tratagems you have &s;heltered your|&s;elf from my enquiry, &s;ince you part|ed &s;ix years ago from my hou&s;e, I &s;hall only tell you that I have thought about you as &s;eldom as my heart would let me, and that now you ap|pear unexpectedly before me, the weak part of my nature is too much melted to do any thing wor&s;e than &s;hed over you the tears of pity and affection.</P>
<P>The uncle and nephew were weep|ing in the neck of each other.</P>
<P>The di&s;ordered and half-dying Ma|tilda ran into her father's arms for that con&s;olation, which he had not the power to give her.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="91">The apothecary threw him&s;elf acro&s;s two chairs, and &s;obbed with &s;orrow and joy.</P>
<P>I felt a mixture of &s;en&s;ations, of which, if the reader would wi&s;h to gain the true idea; it is nece&s;&s;ary that he has been at &s;ome period of his life, in the &s;ame in&s;tant, inexpre&s;&s;ibly wretched and inexpre&s;&s;ibly happy.</P>

<P>During this whole &s;cene, young Davies, the nephew, behaved with a contrition &s;o &s;incere and &s;o mode&s;t, yet &s;o perfect a &s;en&s;e of his impro|priety that I never &s;aw him &s;o truly to advantage; and it plainly appeared by every look and action of Matilda, that, with all his errours, he was more beloved by his mi&s;tre&s;s than ever.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LV. IN THE PARADISE OF SHENSTONE-GREEN, THE WEEDS SHOOT UP APACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the&s;e young folks were retired&mdash;to do which required much aukward and delicate difficulty &mdash;Sir Matthew took hold of my hand, and exclaimed aloud&mdash;Lookee, Sir Benjamin, I &s;ee plainly the de&s;ign which your daughter has upon my nephew. The point has been palpa|ble ever &s;ince I found <HI>out</HI> the young ra&s;cal. But 'tis a match I do not ap|prove, and if you plea&s;e I will tell
<PB N="95" REF="101">you why&mdash;However, let them play their little tricks upon one another for the pre&s;ent, and in a day or two I will &s;ettle their love &s;tory, I warrant. The fir&s;t matter is, the mi&s;chief which my young rake-&s;hame had done in the vil|lage; let us &s;ee how that matter &s;tands.</P>
<P>I was about to reply to all the articles of this peculiar addre&s;s, when the apothecary cried out, here is wor|thy Mr. Sarca&s;m coming into the court-yard. Now for &s;ome news; here re-entered Matilda and Sir Mat|thew's nephew, both blu&s;hing ro&s;y red.</P>
<P>I have the honour to wait upon you at this time, upon &s;undry bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="96" REF="102">(&s;aid Samuel, as he bowed in his methodical manner to the com|pany). Imprimis, you mu&s;t know that the builders and fitters-up of the &s;eve|ral hou&s;es of amu&s;ement have con|&s;ented to take them into their own hands; partly, indeed, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the pen&s;ioners concerned therein have betaken them&s;elves to flight; and the &s;aid builders and co. do in|tend &s;peedily adverti&s;ing the &s;ame for SALE BY AUCTION.</P>
<P>And I will be a bidder, cried Sir Matthew. Samuel &s;miled upon the imagined Seabrooke, and went on.</P>
<P>Secondly, there are about thirteen hou&s;es vacated, which naturally drop
<PB N="97" REF="103">to my honoured ma&s;ter, Sir Benjamin Beauchamp.</P>
<P>Excellent, cried Sir Matthew, that is the mo&s;t promi&s;ing news I have heard yet. Tho&s;e hou&s;es for the future &s;hall be more prudently occu|pied.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel gave a &s;econd look at the &s;uppo&s;ed Seabrooke, and pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Mr. Hackney Old blade the lame &s;oldier (lately preferred by your Honour) in conjunction with Mr. Henry Hewit, and Squire Sidney, have dipped their pen&s;ions pretty deep to do an action which &s;eemed wi&s;e in <HI>their</HI> eyes though it &s;eemed <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> in mine.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104">To wit, they have paid off certain claims made by the real creditors of the young gentleman, whom, if mine eyes fail me not, &s;itteth now by the &s;ide of that young lady.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> claims, Mr. Sarca&s;m, did you &s;ay, (an&s;wered young Davies ri&s;ing) my claims?</P>
<P>In troth, &s;ir, rejoined Samuel, they were ju&s;t debts, and would have gone abroad to your di&s;advantage, &s;o the above gentlemen have bought up your character with the be&s;t part of their annuities.</P>
<P><HI>Whew,</HI> &s;aid Sir Matthew, there's for you! Yet do they pretend, that you have &s;till the balance on your &s;ide&mdash; Now how far that is really the ca&s;e is&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105">Hu&s;h&mdash;hu&s;h&mdash;cried young Davies.</P>
<P>As to that, &s;ir, continued Samuel, it is fit that every gentleman &s;hould have his due, and as you have a &s;ort of character that cannot be hurt by telling the good with the&mdash;the&mdash;<HI>the not quite &s;o good,</HI> I &s;hould humbly conceive&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h I &s;ay, replied Davies, if you go on, I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely leave the room.</P>
<P>Lord, how &s;trange you are Danby (I &s;hould &s;ay Davies) &s;aid Matilda&mdash;pray, Mr. Sarca&s;m, tell every &s;yllable that you know to his advantage, and I will bear you harmle&s;s.</P>

<P>MR. Elixir and Samuel were &s;ent away with my compliments to the academicians, letting them know, that I and my party would certainly wait upon them at the time appointed.</P>
<P>When the&s;e men had left the room, Sir Matthew Davies turned about to his nephew, and, in the pre&s;ence of Matilda, &s;poke thus&mdash;Lookee, Dan|vers, I &s;ee your de&s;ign is to get the affections of that young lady; now I
<PB N="108" REF="114">mu&s;t hone&s;tly tell you, that I love her my&s;elf; and though I am ten years, or perhaps fifteen, too old for her, yet I have cheri&s;hed &s;erious thoughts of a&s;king her to be my wife. Now, this is to give you notice that I &s;hall mo&s;t formidably &s;tand between you and the accompli&s;hment of your wi&s;hes &mdash;Nay, I &s;hall very &s;olemnly be your rival, till by a cour&s;e of rational con|duct you have got better argu|ments on your &s;ide to &s;upplant me than a fair face and the prime of your youth.</P>
<P>Do not think, young gentleman, that &s;uch a girl as Matilda is to be thrown away upon a fellow who has already contributed, not a little, to aid her father in &s;quandering her na|tural
<PB N="109" REF="115">inheritance. I &s;ay, don't you think this; for be a&s;&s;ured&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear, &s;ir, an&s;wered the beautiful youth with the tears &s;hining in his eyes&mdash;dear uncle, if you could &s;ee now into my converted heart&mdash;if&mdash;</P>
<P>It is too early to make profe&s;&s;ions, replied Sir Matthew in the &s;ame com|manding tone. I had rather look at your heart than hear your words. I make you a very generous offer. I will &s;acrifice my affection to your's when it is clear to the lady's father that you de&s;erve the preference. That may ea&s;ily <HI>be</HI> Danvers, for you have only to check your vile pa&s;&s;ion for magnificence, and you will be ju&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="116">what you ought to be for my little play-mate there.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir Matthew, cried Matilda, running to his knee as u&s;ual, I &s;o well know the goodne&s;s of his heart&mdash; that&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h&mdash;<HI>Whew</HI>&mdash;hu&s;h, hu&s;&s;ey&mdash; &s;aid the baronet. He knows the con|ditions. Let him con&s;ider them. So now go and tell him from me, that he is a very hand&s;ome fellow, and that though he is my rival, I will neither run him through the body nor blow out his brains.</P>
<P>Here the good heart of Sir Matthew melted as he &s;poke, and he ran into his nephew's arms, begging him for
<PB N="111" REF="117">God's &s;ake to make Matilda amends for having fooled away &s;o much of her fortune. I take all this pains with thee, Danvers, &s;aid Sir Matthew, tenderly taking his hand, becau&s;e thee ha&s;t a heart.

<P>I &s;ay, Sir Matthew, &s;aid I, that we have tortuned them enough and cannot do better than leave them together till they recover them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Aye, replied the baronet, I &s;ee plainly that you are all in a plot again&s;t poor Seabrooke. I &s;hall be thrown out of my chance, and the

I maintain, Mr. Pre&s;ident, that it is neither convenient nor nece&s;&s;ary for man to know much; and I &s;u&s;pect that we are every hour running our no&s;es again&s;t matters that are wholly out of our line. Pray, therefore, let

<P>You have propo&s;ed que&s;tions enough, friend, &s;aid I, for at lea&s;t a twelve|month's debate, and I therefore ad|vi&s;e, that you re&s;erve the re&s;t for more lei&s;ure, as it begins to get late.</P>

<Q><P>When the mo&s;t powerful, &s;aga|cious and wi&s;e Deity had, in &s;ix days, put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to his work&mdash;no le&s;s a performance than that of compo&s;ing the world&mdash; when he had properly arranged the heavenly bodies, adju&s;ted the mu|&s;ick of the &s;pheres, and fitted every &s;tar to its orbit: when the &s;ecret &s;prings which moved and regulated this &s;ublime machine were curiou&s;ly concealed from the acute&s;t exami|ner, and when an impenetrable veil was thrown over the arcana of na|ture;
<PB N="137" REF="141">it is &s;aid, that the great author of the whole, in the ineffa|bility of his indulgence, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with ob&s;erving the progre&s;s of tho&s;e ingenious little contrivers who call them&s;elves PHILOSOPHERS.</P>
<P>To this end, &s;ays the &s;tory, he &s;ummoned all tho&s;e who, on this &s;peck of earth, had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as the founders or inven|tors of any particular faith: &s;ophi&s;ts, doctors, and all the proud &s;ons of harangue and di&s;putation were there. Scot, Bonaventure, Ga&s;&s;endi, Tho|mas of Aquin, De&s;cartes and every other illu&s;trious name which hath either been tru&s;ted to the wing of po&s;terity, or dropped into the vale of oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="142">They approached the &s;tar-in|circled throne of the univer&s;al fa|ther, who, con&s;idering them as they really were, &s;tooped from his unri|valled dignity, and conver&s;ed upon equal terms.</P>
<P>Lookee, my friends, let us &s;ee which of you hath the mo&s;t intimate acquaintance with the governor of nature. Tell me what I am, how I am made, and what is my &s;ecret? Tell me by what force or manage|ment the comets are &s;u&s;tained; and why in that globe upon which you once crawled, one ounce of good is, by a de&s;tiny too fatal, mixed up with fifty ounces of evil? When you have &s;ettled the&s;e points, you may, if you plea&s;e, by way of &s;up|plement
<PB N="139" REF="143">tell me, who and what you your&s;elves are. Speak freely.</P>
<P>It is a day of ab&s;olute liberty. Speak to me with the &s;ame confi|dence you have &s;poken and written to your fellow-atoms. I am aware that prizes have been propo&s;ed by way of encouraging you to the&s;e matters. Be it &s;o, I will, for once, adopt the rule of your academies, and give to him who &s;hall offer the be&s;t and cleare&s;t idea, a great deal of money, and his &s;alvation into the bargain.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, the philo&s;ophers ap|plauded the propo&s;al, and friend <HI>Thomas</HI> ro&s;e fir&s;t&mdash;Thomas who always gets &s;o well through the
<PB N="140" REF="144">thick and thin of an argument, and replies to every thing without hav|ing a doubt of any thing.</P>
<P>Thou art, &s;aid he, the exi&s;tence and the e&s;&s;ence, the pure &s;ub&s;tance, and the &s;imple attribute: thou wert <HI>in</HI> time, <HI>out</HI> of time, <HI>before</HI> time and after time; the beginning, the mid|dle, and the end; the great princi|ple, and the great effect; thou art pre&s;ent every where without being any where.</P>
<P>The eternal, at the&s;e words, &s;aid, courage noble Thomas, courage, and covered the natural <HI>awe</HI> of his coun|tenance by a &s;mile.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little bu&s;tle, <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> got up&mdash;De&s;cartes, who was ever in
<PB N="141" REF="145">&s;earch of the whirlwind that he could not meet with&mdash;who&s;e head was, as it were, be-powdered with &s;ubtle matter, and who went blundering on without even having read &s;o much as the Evangeli&s;t.</P>
<P>Since I am permitted to &s;peak, &s;aid <HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> behold an argument, which I take to be uncontrovertible. To <HI>be,</HI> it is enough that you are <HI>po&s;|&s;ible.</HI> With re&s;pect to your univer&s;e it is a &s;triking thing enough; but, whenever you think proper, I will make quite another-gue&s;s-affair of it.</P>
<P>I am able&mdash;yes, I De&s;cartes, am able to form elements, animals, light and whirlwinds, out of a
<PB N="142" REF="146">little piece of matter. Who knows the laws of motion &s;o well as De&s;cartes?</P>
<P>The Deity &s;miled with pity for the &s;econd time. Then ro&s;e the uncertain and he&s;itating <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi.</HI> He tremb|lingly propo&s;ed to God his crooked atoms, although out of fa&s;hion, and decayed; but not venturing to &s;ay any thing of the &s;upreme E&s;&s;ence, he &s;tammered out a few more words about his crooked atoms and &s;at down.</P>
<P>Next &s;tepped forth, with mea&s;ured pace, a little, long-no&s;ed Jew; poor, mode&s;t, happy, &s;atisfied and retired. His complexion was pale, his under|&s;tanding &s;ubtle&mdash;he was more cele|brated
<PB N="143" REF="147">than read, and he concealed him&s;elf under the mantle of his ma&s;|ter De&s;cartes.</P>
<P>Pardon me, &s;aid he&mdash;addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the throne, and &s;peaking very low&mdash;pardon me&mdash;but I think, between our&s;elves, that you have no exi&s;tence at all. This, do I believe, is proved by my mathematicks.</P>
<P>Some feeble &s;choolmen, and bad criticks have oppo&s;ed me; but you are able to judge how far I have been in the right. You only are able to determine the limits of the genius of Spino&s;a.</P>
<P>The &s;olid earth and azure heavens trembled at the&s;e words with horror
<PB N="144" REF="148">and affright. Thomas of Aquin &s;tepped back: all the philo&s;ophers looked alarmed; but the clement and good Deity, lamented the infidelity of Spino&s;a, ordered his poor brain to be cured, and gently commanded that he &s;hould be ex|cluded from the &s;enate of &s;cience.</P>
<P>Spino&s;a withdrew under the &s;up|port of a few partizans.</P>
<P>Our philo&s;ophers, perceiving with what unbounded indulgence the Deity deigned to compa&s;&s;ionate their extravagances, immediately held out in oftentatious pomp an hundred fair chimeras, and noble efforts of the human under&s;tanding. They &s;poke, di&s;puted, oppo&s;ed, &s;upported,
<PB N="145" REF="149">cried and &s;houted all together. The heavens and the earth were in an uproar.</P>
<P>Chaos was come again. Thus, when to dine with &s;ome withered witch of a woman who erects her reputation upon feeding men of letters, fifteen or twenty <HI>beaux e&s;prits,</HI> family authors, rhym&s;ters, com|pilers, &s;ong-makers, and tran&s;lators are gathered together, the hou&s;e re|echoes with the howlings of the hungry rabble, and the wandering pa&s;&s;engers &s;tand gaping in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>And now upro&s;e with a con&s;cious air, the redoubted <HI>Mallebranche.</HI> Speak to the <HI>letter,</HI> &s;peak to the <HI>word,</HI> and then I will an&s;wer, &s;aid
<PB N="146" REF="150">he. In oppo&s;ition to him, <HI>Arnauld</HI> &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and furiou&s;ly &s;aid, that, the Sovereign Bounty created the human race propen&s;ely to damn it. <HI>Leibnitz</HI> announced to the Turk and the Chri&s;tian, that in his Harmony they would not be able to comprehend his meaning, that God, the world, and us little creeping creatures are nothing with|out <HI>Monades.</HI> Every philo&s;opher di&s;covered his &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ported his opinion.</P>
<P>The Deity by no means enraged&mdash; he is the be&s;t of fathers&mdash;permitted his children, without impo&s;ing laws too rigid, to amu&s;e them&s;elves like libertines as they were, with the work
<PB N="147" REF="151">of his hands. But, as none of them had an&s;wered the que&s;tions quite to his &s;atisfaction, he put off the prize to another year.</P>
<P>On the very &s;ame day, however (continues the tale) he di&s;patched his Angel Gabriel the amba&s;&s;ador of peace &mdash;the firm friend of pure hearts, and the me&s;&s;enger of good actions&mdash;with a particular commi&s;&s;ion down to earth. Immediately the winged agent took a flight into twenty provinces, and paid a vi&s;it to &s;aints, popes, princes, car|dinals, and inqui&s;itors, mo&s;t of whom were, in pa&s;t ages, devout per&s;e|cutors.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;aid he, the benign Father of all Mercies, orders you to
<PB N="148" REF="152">divert your&s;elves without oppre&s;&s;ing any other per&s;on. Be happy your|&s;elves, but do not make others mi&s;erable. He knows very well that there are a &s;et of pretenders in in the world&mdash;a kind of literary em|pyricks, very wi&s;e and very pro|found&mdash; who are, like your&s;elves, egregrious blockheads. But as they have neither the power nor the will to do any harm, the good God my ma&s;ter is too full of compa&s;&s;ion to arm his omnipotence again&s;t the im|becillity of fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e poor atoms, who have a glimmering faculty of thinking, think wrong, ought they to be roa&s;ted for that? Alas! human philo&s;ophy is of &s;uch a nature that one &s;hould
<PB N="149" REF="153">not too rigidly mark what it doeth ami&s;s. Believe me, the book of a metaphy&s;ician is no very dangerous matter. As it is born &s;o dieth it in feeblene&s;s. The arguments, which ye can make u&s;e of again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, are as arrows &s;hot from a loo&s;ened bow that is pulled by the arm of an infant. They mu&s;t needs drop &s;hort of their mark. And when that mark is the glorious maje&s;ty of earth and heaven, judge how very wretched mu&s;t be your mo&s;t a&s;piring attempts!</P>
<P>To talk and to &s;cribble is the pri|vilege of the thing which hath mo&s;t vanity, and the lea&s;t rea&s;on to be vain.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="154">Imitate your tender father who doth nothing but &s;mile and for|give.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here ends my &s;tory, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and it is now ea&s;y to determine who&s;e &s;y&s;tem is the be&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIX. PHILOSOPHY CONTRIBUTETH TO THE DESTRUCTION OF SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole a&s;&s;embly was up in arms at this &s;tory, at the rela|tion of which I perfectly &s;huddered.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophers deemed it ab|&s;urd.</P>
<P>The wits applauded it as a fine mor&s;el of <HI>fun.</HI></P>
<P>The auditors, in general, declared it was impious and profane. But the
<PB N="152" REF="156">murmurs of the partizans &s;o violently increa&s;ed, that I ro&s;e with indignation from my chair, and darting a look of contempt at the &s;tory-teller, went out of the Academy exclaiming, that I neither liked the in&s;titution nor the principles on which it was to move; and that they &s;hould never meet with my concurrence till they were likely to be conducted more to the honour of my <HI>Village,</HI> my COUNTRY and my GOD.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e declarations, the di&s;putants went on with all the vigour and violence of bigotted con|trover&s;y; and the pa&s;&s;ion for declaim|ing grew to &s;uch a &s;ize that it &s;eemed to lord it over every other. It was
<PB N="153" REF="157">in vain that I combated this with all the little authority I had left my&s;elf; I argued upon the &s;core of its involv|ing us in religious di&s;&s;entions, the fatal effects of which I pathetically pointed out. In reply to this, they in&s;i&s;ted that it was curtailing a gene|rous liberty, and inflicting upon them a &s;candalous &s;ervitude, which implied a de&s;ire to tyrannize: and how, &s;aid they, can Sir Benjamin Beauchamp pretend to forbid tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments taking place in a free village, which have always flouri&s;hed in all large and poli&s;hed cities. TO THINK, they &s;aid, characterized men much le&s;s than to give <HI>language</HI> to thought. Speech was, in their opinion, the cardinal di&s;tinction of humanity, and if <HI>Shen|&s;tone-Green</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="158">was not, above all other villages or towns upon earth, the pro|pere&s;t for fair and full debate, they did not conceive rightly the idea of the liberty of Sir Benjamin's &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In proportion as I re&s;i&s;ted, the phi|lo&s;ophers preached up with vehe|mence the tolerating &s;pirit, and when my con&s;ent was by no means to be gained to the contrivance of the Sy&s;|tematick Academy, the members pub|lickly told me, that I had no power to repeal an act I had voluntarily made; and that as I had no right to tax the human under&s;tanding, they &s;hould proceed in the inve&s;tigation of truth, though to get at her temple it might be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hake the very
<PB N="155" REF="159">roof of the Academy with the &s;olid powers of a metaphy&s;ical argument.</P>
<P>Thus, obliged to give up the point, the meetings became &s;o frequent that the folly &s;pread it&s;elf about till it fairly begirt my unfortunate village like a &s;urrounding pe&s;tilence. In a little time all &s;orts of religioni&s;ts, &s;ects, and &s;y&s;tem-mongers crept into a com|munity &s;ufficiently divided before. Parties were formed and &s;u&s;tained with an animo&s;ity which denoted the mo&s;t inveterate prejudice and hatred of each other: &s;ome combated for the Epicurean, &s;ome for the Platonick &s;y&s;tem; and it was no uncommon thing to &s;ee a number of my people gathered together to ob&s;erve fair fight|ing,
<PB N="156" REF="160">with tongue and fi&s;t, betwixt a Stoick and a Sceptick; a Materiali&s;t and a Roman Catholick, a Bramin and a Spino&s;ian. The infection pre|&s;ently ran to Trade&s;men's-Corner, and my mechanicks fir&s;t hurried their work, and then fairly left it, to get to the Academy. Many of them, who had weak heads and &s;trong lungs, were exalted, by the force of &s;uch accompli&s;hments, from hearers to &s;peakers; and by &s;uch means, tho&s;e who were formerly hone&s;t men, and indu&s;trious traders&mdash;who were, per|haps, rai&s;ed from the hard fall of unavoidable bankruptcy, or &s;et up newly in the &s;hops I had provided&mdash; turned out blind enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or ab&s;urd religioni&s;ts, each of whom had ju&s;t
<PB N="157" REF="161">knowledge as well as ju&s;t religion enough to make them enemies, but not enough to make them friends.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> was now in an uproar both from civil and re|ligious misfortunes. It was mi&s;erably divided again&s;t it&s;elf, and you may be &s;ure, reader, the total &s;ubver&s;ion of my little empire was not far off.</P>

<P>On reading this letter to Sir Mat|thew Davies, he &s;aid, he mu&s;t have &s;ome conver&s;ation with Sarca&s;m, and begged he might be &s;ent for.</P>
<P>While the&s;e orders were giving, an expre&s;s arrived at the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e for Sir Matthew, who received a &s;mall che&s;t, and a large packet of Letters. One of the&s;e, &s;aid he, ex|amining
<PB N="165" REF="169">the hand, &s;o particularly concerns me that I mu&s;t retire to read it.</P>
<P>He withdrew to the next room, beckoning his nephew to follow him.</P>
<P>Matilda and I were alone.</P>
<P>Hang it, papa, &s;aid &s;he, this <HI>Shen|&s;tone-Green</HI> is but a poor place after all.</P>
<P>A very poor place, indeed, Ma|tilda.</P>
<P>Lord, Lord, how much better had I been feeding my linnets, nur&s;ing my &s;ick canary, and driving the kite from my chickens, in Cumberland!</P>
<P>Heigho, Matilda!</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="170">And yet, papa, it has its charms too. I am &s;ure I love this flower that I have got in my hand ten thou&s;and times better than all the flowers that ever grew in Cumberland.</P>
<P>How long is it, my dear, &s;ince Sir Matthew's nephew went into the gar|den and cut with your &s;ci&s;&s;ars&mdash;</P>
<P>P&s;haw&mdash;now you think, papa, that I like the flower upon that account&mdash; Now, I prote&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>But this village, my dear, I declare it is grown dete&s;table to me.</P>
<P>Oh! I hate it &s;o, papa, I never de&s;ire to &s;et my foot in it again.</P>

<P>Sir Matthew's nephew and you I &s;uppo&s;e, Matilda&mdash;Hey!</P>
<P>Lord, papa, your head runs of nothing but Sir Matthew's nephew.</P>
<P>But &s;ince we are alone Matilda, let me frankly confe&s;s to you, that I blu&s;h to think how deep I have plunged my fortune in a fooli&s;h &s;cheme, and in|jured thereby my dear Matilda. Through my ab&s;urdity, my dear, you will not have near &s;o much money as you ought to have had.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="172">Then I &s;hall have le&s;s occa&s;ion for it you know, papa, for Danvers will be a good oeconomi&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>Danvers, did you &s;ay, Matilda?&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, papa, and I do a&s;&s;ure you, he ye&s;terday declared to me upon his knees&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon his knees, Matilda?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, I &s;ay, he declared upon both his knees, while he put up his dear white hands, thus, and laid his &s;weet cheek to my face&mdash;</P>
<P>His cheek to your face, Matilda?</P>
<P>&mdash;Ju&s;t for all the world as it might be thus&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="173">Lord, papa, how rough your &s;kin is to his&mdash;well, and he &s;wore that &s;ince his la&s;t vi&s;it to the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, he valued one &s;hilling more than ever he did a guinea before.&mdash;</P>
<P>Do you indeed, &s;aid I, Danvers; I do by my &s;oul, replied he, I do by this ki&s;s.</P>
<P>By this ki&s;s, Matilda, did you &s;ay?</P>
<P>Ki&s;s, papa, why if you had &s;een him ki&s;s me that time, it was &s;o differ|ent from every other&mdash;</P>
<P>Every <HI>other,</HI> Matilda?</P>
<P>That you never could have forgot it&mdash;for the tears fell upon the poor
<PB N="170" REF="174">things face, and there was &s;o much grief about his eyes, and his dear lips turned &s;o pale, that I thought we &s;hould have both died upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Then you love him, Matilda, more than ever. To be &s;ure I do, papa, and is not there good rea&s;on for it? Is not Danvers quite a tame, gentle creature, and don't he love me with all his &s;oul?</P>
<P>But if after all, Matilda, he &s;hould gain your affections and then prove faithle&s;s.</P>
<P>Then, papa, will I be &s;o good humoured and &s;o faithful, that I will touch his fine heart and win him back again.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="175">You are re&s;olved then to have him, Matilda, at all events.</P>
<P>I would make my&s;elf very mi&s;era|ble to plea&s;e my father.</P>
<P>Come to your father's arms&mdash;your father's heart, Matilda, for you are dearer to me than&mdash;</P>
<P>Here, Sir Matthew and his nephew, who were in the next room ru&s;h|ed in.</P>

<P>Oh! my God, &s;aid young Davies, what &s;hall I do! Why do my tears refu&s;e to relieve me in this exce&s;s of my happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, Matilda, &s;aid I, you and Mr. Davies were to go and court the &s;tars this fine evening, as you &s;it on the little bench in the alcove where there is &s;carce room for two per&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXI. A PROPOSAL FOR THE NEW-MODEL|LING OF SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>BY this time entered Mr. Samuel Sarca&s;m in obedience to the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Mr. Samuel, &s;aid Sir Mat|thew, you would wi&s;h to quit the <HI>Green?</HI></P>
<P>Your Honours both know my rea&s;ons, replied the &s;teward.</P>
<P>To tell you the truth, my friend, &s;aid Sir Matthew, I am as tired of it
<PB N="175" REF="179">as your&s;elf, and I think I may an&s;wer for Sir Benjamin into the bargain. Say the truth, Sir Benjamin, is not your frolick over? Are you not convinced that Ma&s;ter Shen&s;tone and you have only &s;tarted a project, who&s;e execution hath "furni&s;hed inconve|niencies proper only for a lively novel."</P>
<P>I am indeed, &s;aid I, groaning forth my profound conviction.</P>
<P>That being the ca&s;e, an&s;wered Sir Matthew, &s;uppo&s;e we make the be&s;t of a bad nece&s;&s;ity, and turn as much as po&s;&s;ible our misfortune to advan|tage.</P>
<P>Surely, &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="180">Putting up, therefore, with the lo&s;s of the &s;everal irrecoverable pen|&s;ions, and the &s;ums that have been jerked away upon other &s;ubjects equally u&s;ele&s;s, I have a plan to &s;ettle every thing el&s;e on a decent footing.</P>
<P>Heavens, &s;aid I, what plan is that?</P>
<P>FIRST,</P>
<P>Let your traders live here as in any other town, continuing to work and &s;ell to the be&s;t advantage they can. If they are rich enough to cock-fight, let them cock-fight; but, at all events, let them pay a trifling yearly rent to you for their hou&s;es, which, if they choo&s;e to <HI>quit,</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="181">&s;o much the better; then you may get better tenants; if they like to &s;tay, &s;o be it. They will know the conditions: if they are in&s;olent com|pel them into civility by law.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> come to this? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t come to this or wor&s;e, re|plied Sir Matthew.</P>
<P>In troth, your Honour whi&s;tles my tune to a T, cried Samuel, &s;miling.</P>
<P>SECONDLY,</P>
<P>Let you, I, and Samuel, continued Sir Matthew, buy, if it is to be done cheaply, all the publick buildings which &s;tand upon your ground, Sir Benjamin, and let us convert them into the following u&s;es: viz.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="182">The Concert-Room into a Charity-Hou&s;e for poor Welch orphans, to be educated and clothed at our expence till the age of twelve years.</P>
<P>The Pantheon, into a Free-School for boys.</P>
<P>The Theatre into an Alms-Hou&s;e for all old people pa&s;t labour.</P>
<P>Humph! cried Samuel, a little co&s;tively, this note does not &s;uit my organs, your Honour, quite &s;o well as the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THIRDLY,</P>
<P>Let &s;uch pen&s;ioners hou&s;es as are vacated be let to any body who choo&s;es to hire them, and <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> is become too popular not to attract
<PB N="179" REF="183">inhabitants. The profits of the&s;e may go towards the maintenance of the charities. It would be well to cultivate commerce and invite all people to &s;ettle in this village, which may be ea&s;ily done if the grand articles of life come cheap to them at fir&s;t &s;etting out.</P>
<P>Samuel &s;hook his head.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY,</P>
<P>Let matters, &s;aid Sir Matthew, go on ju&s;t as they will, do you take care, Sir Benjamin, to be paid for every thing that is claimable; and I charge you to let the laws take their cour&s;e for the future from one corner of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> to the other.</P>
<P>But how, Sir Matthew, &s;aid I, are all the&s;e things to be done. I have
<PB N="180" REF="184">laid out already an immen&s;e &s;um of money, and mu&s;t continue to pay off tho&s;e cur&s;ed annuities.</P>
<P>Read that letter then, an&s;wered Sir Matthew.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR MATTHEW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your wandering whim has not injured your fortunes, for I con|&s;idered your intere&s;t as mine, and have looked vigilantly after every thing that belonged to Sir Matthew Davies, while he was humourou&s;ly vagabonding it as Mr. Seabrooke. Your immen&s;e adventures which you hazarded abroad are returned &s;afe, with &s;uch cargoes and freights as mu&s;t &s;well your large fortune into almo&s;t an immen&s;ity. The &s;ucce&s;s of a cer|tain
<PB N="181" REF="185">baronet, who traded to the Indian &s;hores, is this very day blazing in the papers, &s;o that your pre&s;ence becomes nece&s;&s;ary, as, indeed, nothing effectual can be done with|out you. It is well your travelling name is no longer nece&s;&s;ary, for it is &s;o proper for you to come to town, and a&s;&s;ume your real &s;elf, that had <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> been really a paradi&s;e in&s;tead of a mere mortal village, built with mens hands, and polluted by mens vices, you could not con&s;i&s;tently have delayed your departure. Your captains will all want you in ten days, which mu&s;t be the very longe&s;t date of your ab&s;ence from London.</P>

<P>I HOLD <HI>that,</HI> reader, to be a vil|lainous drawback upon thy plea|&s;ure, which delays, unnece&s;&s;arily, the concluding events of an intere&s;ting book.

<HEAD>CHAP. LXIV. WHICH IS MORE THAN WAS BARGAINED FOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE moral to be adduced from this work, is, clearly, to prove the ab&s;olute chimera of forming any &s;ociety which is to a&s;&s;ociate any num|ber of people to enjoy one man's bene|faction under the eye of the benefac|tor. It is impo&s;&s;ible to introduce re&s;tricting regulations among&s;t men who expect that a favour &s;hould be as delicate as it is generous; &s;o that no &s;uch &s;ocieties can exi&s;t without be|ing thrown into di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="194">The benefactor may, indeed, make re&s;trictions, but he is, upon the <HI>Shen|&s;tonian</HI> principle, in too nice a &s;ituation to enforce their practice; thus his lenity will produce evils which he can|not puni&s;h; and his &s;everity and in|dulgence are equally dangerous.</P>
<P>It therefore follows, that good order among&s;t men can be expected only under the check of governments, where wealth and preferment depend on the indu&s;try and care of every &s;ingle indi|vidual; where the intere&s;t of one is deeply involved in that of another; where hope, fear, de&s;ire, and gratifica|tion, and all the chain of tumultuous and gentle pa&s;&s;ions are excited by due degrees; &s;o that any exce&s;s in either is not with impunity to infringe the
<PB N="191" REF="195">rights of a neighbour; where few are <HI>overladen with obligation,</HI> but every man &s;truggles for a little, &s;o that ob|ligations are pretty equally given and be&s;towed; and where, in fine, there is a regular code of laws, which pervades the empire, and provides equably re|ward and puni&s;hment to guard the privileges of one man from the viola|tions of another.</P>
