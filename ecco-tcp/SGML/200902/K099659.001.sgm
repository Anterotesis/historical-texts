<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE indefatigable means you took to convince me of your friend&s;hip, by promoting the follow|ing trifles, made me take the liberty of in&s;crib|ing them to you; for indeed, I had &s;carce hinted my intention, when you took the earlie&s;t oppor|tunity of procuring tho&s;e e&s;&s;entials, which have proved the means of my bringing them to light; I am perfectly convinced, that you have humanity enough to overlook the too many imperfections
<PB REF="3">
you will meet with, if you &s;hou'd have patience enough to read my little Analects; for from my connections in bu&s;ine&s;s, and the <HI>attention</HI> that I am, from an innate affection, oblig'd to pay my fire-&s;ide, have made me, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, more <HI>inattentive,</HI> than I &s;hould have been; I have in|&s;erted many, I could have wi&s;h'd to era&s;e; be|cau&s;e I had not time to fini&s;h many pieces which I had begun; and indeed, I was out in my calcu|lation, in what would furni&s;h a couple of volumes, but yet determined, not to extend it in appear|ance; I mean, not as is generally done on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to give much paper and little printing; I often wi&s;h'd to have found you at my elbow, when I have &s;ent a proof to pre&s;s, that you might have given a poli&s;h to the many rude, and uncul|tivated pa&s;&s;ages I am afraid you will &s;tammer at.&mdash;However, I &s;hall tru&s;t to your candour and good &s;en&s;e, to make &s;uch allowances, as you &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary; and when I &s;ee you, I am &s;ure you will &s;hew &s;o much the gentleman, as to <HI>whi&s;per</HI> my errors to me, that no a&s;&s;iduous critic may know there is a fault, through you, when he has not capacity enough to find it out him&s;elf.&mdash;But this is rather unnece&s;&s;ary, as I am &s;o circum|&s;tantially
<PB N="v" REF="4">
convinced of your friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; for I always perceived, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, that you &s;eemed happy, rather to throw a veil over an error in your friend, than expo&s;e it to the greedy ear of envy, for the &s;ake of &s;elf-o&s;tentation, or the elevating plaudits of a &s;elect &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I was once in hopes, that the <HI>Nut-brown Maid</HI> would have made its appearance on the the &s;tage, but Mr. GARRICK gave me &s;o many &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons why it would not do, (not altogether dive&s;t|ing it of merit) that I re&s;ign'd my hopes with plea&s;ure, knowing, from the many material marks of friend&s;hip I have experienced from that gen|tleman, if it had been perfectly calculated, he would have given it the faire&s;t chance in his power; therefore I printed it, hoping it might afford &s;ome little entertainment in the clo&s;et. You was plea&s;ed &s;ome time ago to &s;end me a few corrections you had made, in what I had given you to look over, but by &s;ome accident or other, I had the misfortune to lo&s;e them, which was of no little concern to me, as what they were, have e&s;caped my remembrance, &s;o that at lea&s;t I am convinced, you will meet with the &s;ame errors
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
again; whence I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give you &s;ome rea&s;on, why I have not adhered to your amendments; but if ever a future opportunity &s;hould offer, on the like occa&s;ion, I will endea|vour to be more careful.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>I am, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and &s;incerity, your mo&s;t obliged, and humble &s;ervant, GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>AN EVENING's WALK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONE Summer's eve, when ev'ry &s;wain was hous'd,</L>
<L>When Sol had &s;carce one glimmer left behind,</L>
<L>Each little &s;tar, faint glitt'ring, ca&s;t a ray,</L>
<L>And &s;pangled o'er the du&s;ky robe of night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fond of the &s;cene, I wander'd far from home,</L>
<L>O'er level lawns, and flower-breeding vales,</L>
<L>Till weary nature &s;lacken'd in my &s;teps,</L>
<L>And made me halt upon a friendly bank.</L>
<L>Calm thro' a bridge, there ran a peerle&s;s &s;tream,</L>
<L>That &s;carcely mov'd the ozier's &s;lender wand:</L>
<L>Here I took my &s;tand, and view'd the &s;olemn &s;cene.</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="172">
The bat had been an hour on the wing,</L>
<L>Cha&s;ing the night-fly and the buzzing gnat:</L>
<L>The purblind owl had left the antient tower,</L>
<L>Prowling with flo&s;&s;y wing along the mead.</L>
<L>Anon, as out of Chaos, &s;hot a ray</L>
<L>Of chearing light, quiv'ring o'er the hills,</L>
<L>As yet too weak to &s;truggle with the dark;</L>
<L>Or, as th' Egyptian queen, far off beheld,</L>
<L>Shot her fir&s;t beams on the Italian &s;hore,</L>
<L>Her brilliant train reflecting on the waves,</L>
<L>Making the Tybur like a golden &s;ea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Clouds that o'er-hung the horizon, un&s;een,</L>
<L>Appear'd in view, like &s;ilver-&s;kirted troops,</L>
<L>Waiting the up-ri&s;e of the queen of night.</L>
<L>Slow &s;he approach'd, and &s;mil'd upon the world,</L>
<L>Op'ning fre&s;h land&s;capes to my wond'ring eyes.</L>
<L>Philomel now chear'd the embow'ring grove,</L>
<L>The woodlark too, mi&s;taking it for day,</L>
<L>Join'd her &s;weet notes with emulating &s;trains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Near to my left there &s;tood an ancient pile,</L>
<L>By wa&s;ting time, and &s;avage war defac'd,</L>
<L>Like a reduc'd and hoary-headed chief,</L>
<L>Commanding awe, even in de&s;truction.</L>
<L>On its flinty fides deep-dy'd ivy clung;</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="173">
Its roof was capt with velvet-grounded mo&s;s,</L>
<L>And round its ba&s;e, wild weeds and flowers grew,</L>
<L>The &s;tinging nettle with the briars blend,</L>
<L>The &s;ecret haunt of adders and of toads.</L>
<L>Thro' the wide breaches of the rock-built walls,</L>
<L>Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down</L>
<L>Upon the verdant &s;lope, in lines direct and clear,</L>
<L>Reflecting on a dimpled brook below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A &s;olemn &s;ilence now o'er&s;pread the globe,</L>
<L>Save when the minew wanton'd on the &s;tream,</L>
<L>And left a circle &s;preading to the brink.</L>
<L>Anon, as wind from out &s;ome hollow cave,</L>
<L>A deep-felt &s;igh from out the ruins came,</L>
<L>As from a heart ju&s;t bur&s;ting with its load,</L>
<L>Which &s;treight was an&s;wer'd with a voice of woe,</L>
<L>Like &s;orrow &s;oothing the more &s;ad de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Awhile I &s;tood, in doubt, to know the cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Or to retreat, lea&s;t &s;ome deluding fiend,</L>
<L>Feigning the voice of grief, meant to de&s;troy.</L>
<L>At length re&s;olv'd, with caution I approach'd,</L>
<L>O melting &s;ight! my wounded heart ran o'er,</L>
<L>And empty'd at my eyes&mdash;A mournful pair,</L>
<L>The woeful partners of affliction &s;at,</L>
<L>On the low ba&s;is of a mould'ring urn,</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="174">
And open'd to my view a tragic &s;cene.</L>
<L>Conceal'd, I &s;tood, ob&s;erving their di&s;tre&s;s;</L>
<L>She, in her lap, an infant cherub held,</L>
<L>A lovely boy, the offspring of their loves.</L>
<L>Her eyes were bent with &s;orrow on the babe,</L>
<L>While in her face the little dear one &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>And then, with tears of mi&s;ery and love,</L>
<L>She clung him eager to her throbbing brea&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wretched hu&s;band on her neck reclin'd,</L>
<L>Striving to chear his melancholy dame,</L>
<L>Feign'd a hope, tho' foreign to his heart:</L>
<L>But when he found de&s;pair had &s;eiz'd her &s;oul,</L>
<L>His tears bur&s;t forth, and bath'd his manly cheeks,</L>
<L>And on his bended knees he trembling fell,</L>
<L>Lifting his eyes with angui&s;h 'gain&s;t the &s;ky,</L>
<L>With invocations loud, and agonizing &s;ighs,</L>
<L>Imploring heaven for a ray of peace,</L>
<L>Till his loud accents &s;hook the vaulted roof,</L>
<L>And rift his tortur'd brea&s;t.&mdash;I cou'd no more,</L>
<L>But flying to his aid with heart di&s;tre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me,</L>
<L>And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd;</L>
<L>Like the fierce tyger, a&s;&s;ail'd by hunters,</L>
<L>In his dreary den, he &s;tood defen&s;ive o'er his young,</L>
<L><PB N="173" REF="175">
Shielding 'em from danger. With humble voice,</L>
<L>And friendly tears, I mov'd him to attend,</L>
<L>And li&s;ten patient to the voice of pity.</L>
<L>Joy then, with fear and admiration mix'd,</L>
<L>O'er&s;pread each face, and as I &s;pake, they ble&s;t;</L>
<L>Hope, like the &s;un that clouds had long o'erveil'd,</L>
<L>Flu&s;h'd on their cheeks, extingui&s;hing de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye woeful pair let your &s;u&s;picions cea&s;e;</L>
<L>If friends for&s;ake, and creditors pur&s;ue:</L>
<L>If you once more can tru&s;t a thought to hope,</L>
<L>And think it po&s;&s;ible to meet a friend,</L>
<L>Tell me your &s;tory, and you yet &s;hall find</L>
<L>That fate relents, and cea&s;es to afflict.</L>
<L>Tho' here to you a &s;tranger I appear,</L>
<L>To mercy I am none; to &s;ee another wretched,</L>
<L>Makes me wretched too: by &s;erving others,</L>
<L>I &s;till my&s;elf oblige, and meet reward,</L>
<L>Ample reward, a tranquil happine&s;s!</L>
<L>Seeing others &s;o, by me made happy.</L>
<L>I'd rather wipe the tear of grief away,</L>
<L>Than add a ruby to a monarch's crown,</L>
<L>And win a prince's promi&s;e for my pains.</L>
<L>If fate's not giv'n you over to de&s;pair,</L>
<L>And you'll accept of friend&s;hip once again,</L>
<L>Chear your &s;ad hearts&mdash;let ev'ry fear &s;ub&s;ide,</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="176">
Nor doubt a &s;tranger yet may prove a friend;</L>
<L>If you'd be happy, tell me but in what,</L>

<L>Thou gracious being! (if thou art human)</L>
<L>For thou &s;peak'&s;t with a cele&s;tial tongue,</L>
<L>Let me embrace thee;&mdash;O! pardon me, too,</L>
<L>That I a&s;&s;ail'd thee with the threat of death,</L>
<L>When thou but meant to &s;ave me from his &s;haft;</L>
<L>For O! thy words were welcome to my &s;oul</L>
<L>As mollient dews that fall upon the mead,</L>
<L>When parching Sol has curl'd each verdant blade;</L>
<L>Thou ha&s;t pre&s;erv'd to me the deare&s;t ro&s;e</L>

<L>That ever eye beheld, or tempted death to kill,</L>

<L>For they have &s;uffer'd more than I dare tell,</L>
<L>And to repeat, is more than I can bear:</L>
<L>She once, alas, was Fortune's favourite,</L>
<L>And Minerva's pride, the tender fondling</L>
<L>Of a wealthy pair&mdash;O! &s;ad remembrance;</L>
<L>Provoking tears! when will ye cea&s;e to flow!</L>
<L>The&s;e eyes have long been &s;trangers to a &s;mile;</L>
<L>Excu&s;e me, friend, if they di&s;gu&s;t thee.</L>
<L>We &s;ing of others woe, but cry our own;</L>
<L>My heart has gu&s;hed at a thou&s;and veins,</L>
<L><PB N="175" REF="177">
To &s;ee the &s;ufferings of a matchle&s;s wife.&mdash;</L>
<L>There was a time, when this for&s;aken hold,</L>
<L>At &s;uch an hour, would have giv'n delight,</L>
<L>When &s;olitude and night would give a &s;cop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></L>
<L>To thought, and yield a plea&s;ing melancholy</L>
<L>To the jaded mind, o'ercharg'd with plea&s;ure</L>
<L>And variety; but now, how dreary and forlorn</L>
<L>It &s;eems; and as we tell our mournful tale,</L>
<L>With double horror echoes back each word,</L>
<L>Mocking adver&s;ity, in hollow &s;ounds,&mdash;</L>
<L>Telling us over what is death to hear.&mdash;</L>
<L>Such tales as mine, good friend, I oft have read,</L>
<L>Such woeful &s;cenes have oft been play'd;</L>
<L>With &s;ympathizing heart I've heard and &s;een,</L>
<L>And dropp'd a tear for the oppre&s;s'd and brave;</L>
<L>But ere I'd &s;lept the fiction fled my brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And time would leave no traces on the mind.</L>
<L>When we become the objects of di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Remembrance &s;tamps it with an iron &s;eal</L>
<L>Upon our hearts, and ev'ry thought is death.</L>
<L>But to my &s;tory, 'tis my friend's de&s;ire&mdash;</L>
<L>I am no &s;tranger to this gloomy pile,</L>
<L>I oft have paid a vi&s;it to the&s;e walls,</L>
<L>And oft admir'd the romantic form,</L>
<L>When the fair morn invited me abroad,</L>
<L>When fertile nature da&s;y'd ev'ry hill,</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="178">
And ev'ry meadow blu&s;h'd a purple hue:</L>
<L>When thru&s;hes &s;ang, and linnets charm'd the grove;</L>
<L>My heart then drank in plea&s;ure at my eyes,</L>
<L>And felt no interrupter by the way,</L>
<L>No wretched thought to da&s;h it back again.&mdash;</L>
<L>My father was a man of wealth and note,</L>
<L>(And held a man&s;ion in a village by)</L>
<L>A better ne'er gave being to a &s;on:&mdash;</L>
<L>I having read of mighty things abroad,</L>
<L>Of ancient Rome and grand Cairo's court,</L>
<L>The wealth of India and Egyptian wilds.</L>
<L>With thir&s;t for novelty and de&s;ire,</L>
<L>I urg'd my father, and at length prevail'd</L>
<L>That he would let me venture on a tour,</L>
<L>And prove the truth of hi&s;t'ry and report.&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tis &s;ix years &s;ince I left my native home;</L>
<L>Since when, &s;o many wonders I have &s;een,</L>

<LG>
<L>Returning home, I cro&s;s'd the mighty Alps;</L>
<L>A deadly &s;ickne&s;s &s;eiz'd me on the way,</L>
<L>And made me &s;eek for &s;uccour and a friend;</L>
<L>A greater rarity than all I'd met.</L>
<L>An ample dwelling open'd to my view,</L>
<L>To which I bent my way, and &s;helter a&s;k'd,</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="179">
And was receiv'd at once a welcome gue&s;t.</L>
<L>With mild compa&s;&s;ion they beheld my &s;tate,</L>

<L>Di&s;mounting here, I would have enter'd in,</L>

<L>Her &s;upplications did at length prevail.</L>

<L>Love, to whom I &s;oon &s;ubmitted, and embrac'd.</L>
<L>And made my ho&s;te&s;s partner of my life,</L>

<L>To &s;eek for refuge in a foreign land.&mdash;</L>
<L>The action robb'd the good man of his life,</L>

And in di&s;tre&s;s the mournful widow left,</L>
