the Sunday evening.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This practice is too common. It is much to be wi&s;hed that magi&s;trates would put a &s;top to it, as Mr. Simp&s;on did at We&s;ton at the reque&s;t of Mrs. Jones. There is another great evil worth the notice of Ju&s;tices. In many villages during the fair, ale is &s;old at private hou&s;es which have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icence, to the great injury of &s;obriety and good morals.</NOTE> Rebecca, who would on no account have wa&s;ted the Monday, which was a working day, in idlene&s;s, and plea&s;ure, thought &s;he had a very good right to enjoy her&s;elf at the fair on the Sunday evening, as well as to take her children. He&s;ter earne&s;tly begged to be le&s;t at home, and her mother in a rage went without her. A wet walk and more ale than &s;he was u&s;ed to drink gave Re|becca a dangerous fever, during this illne&s;s, He&s;ter who would not follow her to a &s;cene of di&s;&s;olute mirth, attended her night and day, and denied her|&s;elf nece&s;&s;aries that her &s;ick mother might have com|forts. And though &s;he &s;ecretly prayed to God that this &s;ickne&s;s might change her mother's heart yet &s;he never once reproached her, or pat her in mind, that it was caught by indulging in a &s;inful plea&s;ure. Another Sunday night her father told He&s;ter, he thought &s;he had been at &s;chool long enough for him to have a little good of her learn|ing, &s;o he de&s;ired &s;he would &s;tay at home and read to him. He&s;ter cheerfully ran and fetched her Te&s;tament. But John fell a laughing, called her a fool, and &s;aid, "it would be time enough to read the Te&s;tament to him when he was going to die, but at pre&s;ent he mu&s;t have &s;omething merry." So &s;aying, he gave her a &s;ong-book which he had picked up at the Bell. He&s;ter having ca&s;t her eyes
<PB N="4" REF="4">
over it, refu&s;ed to read it, &s;aying, "&s;he did not dare offend God by reading what would hurt her own &s;oul." John called her a canting hypocrite and &s;aid, he would put the Te&s;tament in the fire, for that there was not a more merry girl than &s;he was before &s;he became religious. Her mother for once took her part, not becau&s;e &s;he thought her daughter in the right, but becau&s;e &s;he was glad of any pretence to &s;hew her hu&s;band was in the wrong; though &s;he her&s;elf would have abu&s;ed He&s;ter for the &s;ame thing if John had taken her part. John, with a &s;hocking oath, abu&s;ed them both, and went off in a violent pa&s;&s;ion. He&s;ter, in&s;tead of &s;aying one undutiful word again&s;t her father, took up a P&s;alter in order to teach her little &s;i&s;ters, but Re|becca was &s;o provoked at her for not joining her in her abu&s;e of her hu&s;band, that &s;he changed her humour, &s;aid John was in the right, and He&s;ter a perver&s;e hypocrite, who only made religion a pre|tence for being undutiful to her parents. He&s;ter bore all in &s;ilence, and committed her cau&s;e to him who judgeth righteou&s;ly. It would have been a great comfort to her if &s;he had dared to go and open her heart to Mrs. Crew, and to have joined in the religious exerci&s;es of the evening at &s;chool. But her mother refu&s;ed to let her, &s;aying, it would only harden her heart in mi&s;chief. He&s;ter &s;aid not a word, but after having put the little ones to bed, and heard them &s;ay their prayers but of &s;ight, &s;he went and &s;at down in her own little loft, and &s;aid to her&s;elf, "it would be plea&s;ant to me to have taught my little &s;i&s;ters to read, I thought it was my duty, for David has &s;aid&punc; <HI>Come ye children hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> I would have been &s;till more plea&s;ant to have pa&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="5">
the evening at &s;chool; becau&s;e I am &s;till ignorant, and fitter to learn than to teach; but I cannot do either without flying in the face of my mother; God &s;ees fit to-night to change my plea&s;ant duties into a painful trial. I give up my will, and I &s;ub|mit to the will of my father; but when he orders me to commit a known &s;in then I dare not do it, be|cau&s;e, in &s;o doing, I mu&s;t di&s;obey my father which is in heaven." Now it &s;o fell out that this di&s;pute happened on the very Sunday next before Mrs. Jones's yearly fea&s;t. On May-day all the &s;chool attended her to church, each in a &s;tuff gown of their own earning, and a cap and white apron of her giving. After church there was an examination made into the learning and behaviour of the &s;chools; tho&s;e who were mo&s;t perfect in their chapters and brought the be&s;t character for indu&s;try, humility, and &s;obriety, received a Bible, or &s;ome other good book."</P>
<P>Now He&s;ter had been a whole year hoarding up her little &s;avings in order to be ready with a new gown on the May-day fea&s;t. She had never got le&s;s than two &s;hillings a week, by her &s;pinning, be|&s;ides working for the family, and earning a trifle by odd jobs. This money &s;he faithfully carried to her mother every Saturday night, keeping back, by con&s;ent, only two-pence a week towards the gown. The &s;um was compleat, the pattern had long been &s;ettled, and He&s;ter had only on the Monday morn|ing to go to the &s;hop, pay her money, and bring home her gown to be made. Her mother happened to go out that morning early to iron in a gentleman's family, where &s;he u&s;ually &s;taid a day or two, and He&s;ter was bu&s;y putting the hou&s;e in order before &s;he went to the &s;hop.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
On that very Monday there was to be a meeting at the Bell of all the idle fellows in the pari&s;h, John Wilmot of cour&s;e was to be there. Indeed he had accepted a challenge of the Black&s;mith to a batch at all-fours. The Black&s;mith was flu&s;h of money, John thought him&s;elf the be&s;t player; and that he might make &s;ure of winning, he re&s;olved to keep him&s;elf &s;ober, which he knew was more than the other would do. John was &s;o u&s;ed to go upon tick for ale, that he got to the door of the Bell before he recollected that he could not keep his word with the gambler without money, and he had not a penny in his pocket, &s;o he &s;ullenly turned homewards. He dared not apply to his wife, as he knew he &s;hould be more likely to get a &s;cratched face than a &s;ix-pence from her; but he knew that He&s;ter had received two &s;hillings for her la&s;t week's &s;pinning on Saturday, and perhaps &s;he might not yet have given it to her mother. Of the hoarded &s;um he knew nothing. He a&s;ked her if &s;he could lend him half a crown and he would pay her next day. He&s;ter plea&s;ed to &s;ee him in good-humour after what had pa&s;&s;ed the night before, ran up and fetched down her little box, and, in the joy of her heart that he now de&s;ired &s;omething &s;he could comply with out wounding her con&s;cience, cheerfully poured out her whole little &s;tock upon the table. John was in raptures at the &s;ight of three half crown: and a &s;ix-pence, and eagerly &s;eized it, box and all together with a few hoarded halfpence at the bot|tom, though he had only a&s;ked to borrow half crown. None but one who&s;e heart was hardene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by a long cour&s;e of drunkenne&s;s could have take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> away the whole, and for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. He tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her &s;he &s;hould certainly have it again next morn|ing,
<PB N="7" REF="7">
and indeed intended to pay it, not doubting but he &s;hould double the &s;um. But John over-rated his own &s;kill or luck, for he lo&s;t every farthing to the Black&s;mith, and &s;neaked home before midnight, and quietly walked up to-bed. He was quite &s;ober, which He&s;ter thought a good &s;ign. Next morn|ing &s;he a&s;ked him in a very humble way for the money, which &s;he &s;aid &s;he would not have done, but that if the gown was not bought directly it would not be ready in time for the fea&s;t. John's con&s;cience had troubled him a little for what he had done, for when he was not drunk he was not ill-natured, and he &s;tammered out a broken excu&s;e, but owned he had lo&s;t the money, and had not a farthing left. The moment He&s;ter &s;aw him mild and kind, her heart was &s;oftened, and &s;he begged him not to vex; adding, that &s;he would be con|tented never to have a new gown as long as &s;he lived, if &s;he could have the comfort of always &s;ee|ing him come home as &s;ober as he was la&s;t night. For He&s;ter did not know that he had refrained from getting drunk, only that he might gamble with a better chance of &s;ucce&s;s, and that when a game|&s;ter keeps him&s;elf &s;ober, it is not that he may prac|ti&s;e a virtue, but that he may commit a wor&s;e crime. "I am indeed &s;orry for what I have done," &s;aid he, "you cannot go to the fea&s;t, and what will Madam Jones &s;ay?" "Yes, but I can," &s;aid He&s;ter, "for God looks not at the gown, but at the heart, and I am &s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ees mine full of gratitude at hearing you talk &s;o kindly; and if I thought my dear father would change <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is pre&s;ent evil cour&s;es, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irl at the fea&s;t to-morrow." John walked away mournfully, and &s;aid to him&s;elf, "&s;urely there
<PB N="8" REF="8">
mu&s;t be &s;omething in religion &s;ince it can thus change the heart. He&s;ter was a pert girl, and now &s;he is as mild as a lamb. She was an indolent girl, and now &s;he is up with the lark. She was a vain girl, and would do any thing for a new ribbon; and now &s;he is contented to go in rags to a fea&s;t at which every one el&s;e will have a new gown. She deprived her&s;elf of her gown to give me the money, and yet this very girl &s;o dutiful in &s;ome things would &s;ubmit to be turned out of doors, rather than read a loo&s;e book at my command or break the Sabbath, I do not under&s;tand this, there mu&s;t be &s;ome my|&s;tery in it." All this he &s;aid as he was going to work, In the evening he did not go to the Bell, whether it was owing to his new thoughts or to his not hav|ing a penny in his pocket, I will not take upon me po&s;itively to &s;ay, but I believe it was a little of one, and a little of the other.</P>
<P>As the pattern of the intended gown had long been &s;ettled in the family, and as He&s;ter had the money by her, it was looked on as good as bought, &s;o that &s;he was tru&s;ted to get it brought home and made in her mother's ab&s;ence. Indeed &s;o little did Rebecca care about the &s;chool, that &s;he would not have cared any thing about the gown, if her vanity had not made her wi&s;h that her daughter &s;hould be the be&s;t dre&s;t of any girl at the fea&s;t. Being from home as was &s;aid before, &s;he knew no|thing of the di&s;appointment. On May-day morning, He&s;ter, in&s;tead of keeping from the fea&s;t becau&s;e &s;he had not a new gown, or meanly inventing any excu&s;e dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf out as neatly, as &s;he could in her poor old things, and went to join the &s;chool in order to go to church. Whether He&s;ter had formerly indulged a little pride of heart, and talked of this gown ra|ther
<PB N="9" REF="9">
too much, I am not quite &s;ure, certain it is, there was a great hue and cry made at &s;eeing He&s;|ter Wilmot, the neate&s;t girl, the mo&s;t indu&s;trious girl in the &s;chool, come to the May-day fea&s;t in an old &s;tuff gown, when every other girl was &s;o cre|ditably dre&s;t. Indeed I am &s;orry to &s;ay, there were two or three much too &s;mart for their &s;tation, and who had dizened them&s;elves out in very impro|per finery which Mrs. Jones made them take off before her. "I mean this fea&s;t," &s;aid &s;he, "as a reward of indu&s;try and piety, and not as a trial of &s;kill who can be fine&s;t, and outvie the re&s;t in &s;how. If I do not take care my fea&s;t will become an en|couragement, not to virtue, but to vanity. I am &s;o great a friend to decency of apparel that I even like to &s;ee you deny your appetites that you may be able to come decently dre&s;&s;ed to the hou&s;e of God. To encourage you to do this, I like to &s;et apart this one day of innocent plea&s;ure again&s;t which you may be preparing all the year, by laying a&s;ide &s;omething every week towards buying a gown out of your little &s;avings. But, let me tell you, that meekne&s;s and an humble &s;pirit is of more value in the &s;ight of God and good men than the gaye&s;t cotton gown, or the brighte&s;t pink ribbon in the pari&s;h."</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones, for all this, was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he re&s;t at He&s;ter's mean garb: but &s;uch is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower of a good character, that &s;he gave her credit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or right intention, e&s;pecially as &s;he knew the un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">appy &s;tate of her family. For it was Mrs. Jones's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay (and it is not a bad way) always to wait, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nquire into the truth, before &s;he condemned any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ody of good character, though appearances were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain&s;t them. "As we cannot judge of people's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otives," &s;aid &s;he, "we may, from ignorance often
<PB N="10" REF="10">
condemn their be&s;t actions, and approve of their wor&s;t". "It will be always time enough to judge unfavourably, and let us give others credit as long as we can, and then we in our turn may expect a a favourable judgment from others." He&s;ter was no more proud of what &s;he had done for her fa|ther, than &s;he was humbled by the meanne&s;s of her garb, and though Betty Stiles, one of the girls, who&s;e finery had been taken away &s;neered at her, He&s;ter never offered to clear her&s;elf by expo&s;|ing her father, though &s;he thought it right &s;ecret|ly to inform Mrs. Jones of what had pa&s;t. When the examination of the girls began, Betty Stiles was a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions on the fourth and fifth commandments, which &s;he an&s;wered very well. He&s;ter was a&s;ked nearly the &s;ame que&s;tions, and though &s;he an&s;wered them no better than Betty had done, they were all &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee Mrs. Jones ri&s;e up and give a hand&s;ome Bible to He&s;ter, while &s;he gave nothing to Betty. This girl cried out ra|ther pertly, "Madam, it is very hard that I have no book, I was as perfect as He&s;ter." "I have often told you," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "that religion is not a thing of the tongue but of the heart. That girl gives me the be&s;t proof that &s;he has learned the fourth commandment to good purpo&s;e, who per&s;i&s;ts in keeping holy the Sabbath-day, though command|ed to break it by a parent whom &s;he loves. And that girl be&s;t proves that &s;he keeps the fifth, who gives up her own comfort and cloathing, and credit, to honour and obey her father and mother, even though they are not &s;uch as &s;he could wi&s;h. Betty Stiles, though &s;he could an&s;wer the que&s;tions &s;o readi|ly went a-nutting la&s;t Sunday when &s;he &s;hould have
<PB N="11" REF="11">
been at &s;chool, and refu&s;ed to nur&s;e her &s;ick mo|ther when &s;he could not help her&s;elf."</P>
<P>Farmer Ho&s;kins, who &s;tood by, whi&s;pered to Mrs. Jones, "Well, Madam, now you have con|vinced even me of the benefit of religious in&s;truc|tion, now I &s;ee there is a meaning to it. I thought it was in at one ear and out at the other, and that a &s;ong was as well as a p&s;alm; but now I have found the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I &s;ee your &s;cholars mu&s;t <HI>do</HI> what they <HI>hear,</HI> and <HI>obey</HI> what they <HI>learn.</HI> Why, at this rate, they will all, be the bet|ter &s;ervants for being really godly, and &s;o I will add a pudding to next year's fea&s;t."</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure He&s;ter felt in receiving a new Bible, made her forget that &s;he had on an old gown. She walked to church in a thankful frame; but how great was her joy, when &s;he &s;aw, among a number of working men, her own father going into church. As &s;he pa&s;t by him &s;he ca&s;t on him a look of &s;o much joy and affection, that it brought tears into his eyes, e&s;pecially when he compared her mean dre&s;s with that of the other girls, and thought who had been the cau&s;e of it. John, who had not been at church for &s;ome years, was deeply &s;truck with the &s;ervice. The confe&s;&s;ion with which it opens went to his heart. He felt, for the, fir&s;t time, that he was "a mi&s;erable &s;inner, and that there was no health in him." He now felt com|punction for &s;in in general, though it was only his ill behaviour to his daughter which had brought him to church. The &s;ermon was &s;uch as &s;erved to &s;trengthen the impre&s;&s;ion which the prayers had made, and when it was over, in&s;tead of joining the ringers (for the belfry was the only part of the church John liked, becau&s;e it u&s;ually led to the
<PB N="12" REF="12">
alehou&s;e) he quietly walked back to his work. It was indeed the be&s;t day's work he ever made. He could not get out of his head the whole day the fir&s;t words he had heard at church. "When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedne&s;s and doth that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;ave his &s;oul alive." At night, in&s;tead of going to the Bell, he went home, intending to a&s;k He&s;ter to forgive him; but as &s;oon as he got to the door, he heard Rebecca rating his daughter for having brought &s;uch a di&s;grace on the family as to be &s;een in that old rag of a gown, and in&s;i&s;ted on knowing what &s;he had done with the money. He&s;ter tried to keep the &s;ecret, but her mother declared &s;he would turn her out of doors if &s;he did not tell the truth. He&s;ter was at la&s;t forced to confe&s;s &s;he had given it to her father. Unfortunately for poor John it was at this very moment he opened the door. The mother now divided her fury between her guilty hu&s;band and her innocent child, till from words &s;he fell to blows. John defended his daughter, and received &s;ome of the &s;trokes in|tended for the poor girl. This turbulent &s;cene partly put John's good re&s;olutions to &s;light, though the patience of He&s;ter did him almo&s;t as much good as the &s;ermon he had heard. At length the poor girl e&s;caped up &s;tairs not a little brui&s;ed, and a &s;cene of much violence pa&s;&s;ed between John and Rebecca. She declared &s;he would not &s;it down to &s;upper with &s;uch a brute, and &s;et off to a neighbour's hou&s;e, that &s;he might have the plea|&s;ure of abu&s;ing him the longer. John, who&s;e mind was much di&s;turbed, went up &s;tairs without his &s;upper. As he was pa&s;&s;ing by He&s;ter's little room he heard her voice, and as he concluded &s;he was
<PB N="13" REF="13">
venting bitter complaints again&s;t her unnatural pa|rents, he &s;topped to li&s;ten, re&s;olving to go in and comfort her. He &s;topped at the door, for by the light of the moon he &s;aw her kneeling by her bed&s;ide, and praying &s;o earne&s;tly that &s;he did not hear him. As he made &s;ure &s;he could be praying for nothing but his death, what was his &s;urpri&s;e to hear the&s;e words. "O Lord, have mercy upon my dear father and mother, teach me to love them to pray for them, and do them good, make me more dutiful and more patient, that, adorning the doctrine of God my Saviour, I may recommend his holy religion, and my dear parents may be brought to love and fear thee."</P>
<P>Poor John, who would never have been hard hearted if he had not been a drunkard, could not &s;tand this, he fell down on his knees, embraced his child, and begged her to teach him how to pray. He prayed him&s;elf as well as he could, and though he did not know what words to u&s;e, yet his heart was melted; he owned he was a &s;inner, and begged He&s;ter to fetch the prayer book, and read over the confe&s;&s;ion with which he had been &s;o &s;truck at church. This was the plea&s;ante&s;t order &s;he had ever obeyed. Seeing him deeply affected with a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, &s;he pointed out to him the Sa|viour of &s;inners; and in this manner &s;he pa&s;t &s;ome hours with her father, which were the happie&s;t of her life; &s;uch a night was worth a hundred cotton, or even &s;ilk gowns. In the cour&s;e of the week He&s;ter read over the confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome other prayers, to her father &s;o often that he got them by heart, and repeated them while he was at work. And at length he took courage to kneel down and pray before he went to bed. From that time he
<PB N="14" REF="14">
bore his wife's ill-humour much better than he had ever done, and, as he knew her to be neat, and nota|ble, and &s;aving, he began to think, that if her temper was not quite &s;o bad, his home might &s;till become as plea&s;ant a place to him as ever the Bell had been: but unle&s;s &s;he became more tractable he did not know what to do with his long evenings after the little ones were in bed, for he began once more to delight in playing with them. He&s;ter pro|po&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould teach him to read an hour every night, and he con&s;ented. Rebecca began to &s;torm from the mere trick &s;he had got of &s;torm|ing; but finding that he now brought home all his earnings, and that &s;he got both his money and his company (for &s;he had once loved him) &s;he began to reconcile her&s;elf to this new way of life. In a few months John could read a p&s;alm; in learning to read it he al&s;o got it by heart, and this proved a little &s;tore for private devotion, and while he was mowing he could call to mind a text to chee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his labour, He now went con&s;tantly to church and often dropped in at the &s;chool on a Sunday evening to hear their prayers. He expre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much plea&s;ure at this, that one day He&s;ter ventur|ed to a&s;k him if they &s;hould &s;et up family prayer at home.

When He&s;ter read the exhortation at the begin|ning of this little book, her mother, who &s;at in the corner, and pretended to be a&s;leep, was &s;o much &s;truck that &s;he could, not find a word to &s;ay again&s;t it. For a few nights, indeed, &s;he conti|nued to &s;it &s;till, or pretended to rock the young child while her hu&s;band and daughter were kneel|ing at their prayers. She expected John would have &s;colded her for this, and &s;o perver&s;e was her temper, that &s;he was di&s;appointed at his finding no fault with her. Seeing at la&s;t that he was very patient, and that though he prayed fervently him|&s;elf he &s;uffered her to do as &s;he liked, &s;he lo&s;t the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition for want of &s;omething to pro|voke it. As her pride began to be &s;ubdued, &s;ome little di&s;po&s;ition to piety was awakened in her heart. By degrees &s;he &s;lid down on her knees, though at fir&s;t it was behind the cradle, or the clock, or in &s;ome corner, where &s;he thought they would not &s;ee her. He&s;ter rejoiced even in this outward change in her mother, and prayed that God would at la&s;t be plea&s;ed to touch her heart as he had done that of her father.</P>
<P>As John now &s;pent no idle money, he had &s;aved up a trifle by working over-hours, this he kindly offered to He&s;ter to make up for the lo&s;s of her gown. In&s;tead of accepting it, He&s;ter told him, that as &s;he her&s;elf was young and healthy, &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be able to clothe her&s;elf out of her own &s;av|ings, and begged him to make her mother a pre&s;ent of this gown, which he did. It had been a maxim of Rebecca, that it was better not go to Church at all than go in an old gown. She had, however, &s;o far conquered this evil notion, that &s;he had lately
<PB N="16" REF="16">
gone pretty often. This kindne&s;s of the gown touched her not a little, and the fir&s;t Sunday &s;he put it on, Mr. Simp&s;on happened to preach from this text, "God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble." This &s;ermon &s;o affected Rebecca that &s;he never once thought &s;he had her new gown on, till &s;he came to take it off when &s;he went to-bed, and that very night, in&s;tead of &s;kulk|ing behind, &s;he knelt down by her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>There was one thing &s;unk deep in Rebecca's mind, &s;he had ob&s;erved, that &s;ince her hu&s;band had grown religious he bad been &s;o careful not to give her any offence, that he was become &s;crupulou&s;ly clean; took off his dirty &s;hoes before he &s;at down and was very cautious not to &s;pill a drop of bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on her &s;hining table. Now it was rather remark|able, that as John grew more neat Rebecca grew more indifferent to neatne&s;s. But both the&s;e change aro&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e, the growth of religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in their hearts. John grew cleanly from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of giving pain to his wife, while Rebecca grew in different from having di&s;covered the &s;in and vani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of an over anxious care about trifles.</P>
<P>He&s;ter continues to grow in grace, and in know|ledge.
