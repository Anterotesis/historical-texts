<HEAD>TO THE REVIEWERS OF LITERATURE.</HEAD>
<P>To confirm precept by example; it is propo&s;ed by the author of the&s;e pages, to in&s;cribe the five divi&s;ions, which con&s;titute his work, to as many different per&s;ons, who may illu&s;trate, by their conduct, &s;ome im|portant characters in his book.</P>
<P>In addre&s;&s;ing the opening volume to the REVIEWERS, it is ea&s;y to prove, that neither in a general, nor particular &s;en&s;e, can he mean to in&s;ult their characters, or humiliate his own, by the impotent hope of obviating cen&s;ure, or of &s;ecuring applau&s;e. In a &s;eries of twenty years, nearly half of the author's life, he has received, from the literary journali&s;ts, a &s;ufficient proportion of prai&s;e to animate, and of blame to improve him: the one has operated on his mind, as a poi&s;e to the other; while he has &s;incerely endeavoured to educe good from both: but without implicitly yielding his opinion,
<PB N="ii" REF="4">or fa&s;tidiou&s;ly retaining it again&s;t rea&s;on and remon&s;trance.</P>
<P>The author has ventured to denominate the work LITERARY, as well as dome&s;tick; becau&s;e the &s;ketches of literary conver&s;ation, woven into the hi&s;tory, are intended as an <HI>experiment,</HI> how far &s;uch a plan may tend to exalt the <HI>character</HI> without dimini&s;hing the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition: the principal difficulty of which &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in combining the one with the other, &s;o as to invigorate both. As the profe&s;&s;ional cri|ticks are, by the very nature of their tru&s;t, precluded from private communication, the author thus publickly &s;olicits their opinion, how far the experiment has been &s;ucce&s;sful, or rather, how far the general principle of it is to be &s;anctioned;&mdash;for the mi&s;carriage of the author <HI>individually,</HI> forms no argu|ment why a more &s;kilful adoption of the plan may not contribute as much to the elevation of works of this <HI>nature,</HI> as to the delight of their admirers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the &s;outhern vales of Devon, where the myrtle is &s;aid to bloom unpro|tected, though vi&s;ited by the &s;ea-breeze, &s;tood Fitzorton Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>A writer of de&s;criptive talents, might, in re&s;pect of &s;ituation, expand him&s;elf into volumes; but, as the delineation of the minds and manners, the pa&s;&s;ions and pur|&s;uits, the &s;trength and weakne&s;s, imagina|tions, and &s;tudies, of human beings, are more immediately the objects of this hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t con&s;ider vegetable beauty, however fa&s;cinating, but as the &s;cenery of our picture, and di&s;mi&s;s this part of our &s;ubject with as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle was erected on the &s;loping of a hill; the Manor-hou&s;e of Clare on the declivity of an oppo&s;ite mountain, with
<PB N="2" REF="10">a uniformity of ta&s;te corre&s;ponding to the &s;entiment which had long united the fami|lies; and at a di&s;tance only to render the pro&s;pect more engaging, a third venerable pile reared its head &s;o centrically between the two, that, whether viewed from the manor-hou&s;e or from the ca&s;tle, the eye &s;urveyed its a&s;piring tur|rets, the maje&s;tic avenues that led to its fold|ing-gates, and the delightful woods that &s;tretched them&s;elves on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Indeed, the three domains were placed amid&s;t the very romance of Nature; but we are called from them at pre&s;ent by an earne&s;t de&s;ire to introduce the reader to their inhabitants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Honourable and Reverend Armine Fitzorton, at the &s;etting out of the&s;e annals, was in the &s;eventy-fourth year of his age. He had been, for full &s;ixty of that number, one of the healthie&s;t and happie&s;t men in the world. He married, early, a lady &s;o entirely like him|&s;elf
<PB N="3" REF="11">in mind, in manners, and as far as femi|nine &s;oftne&s;s may be permitted, without &s;tep|ping out of it&s;elf, in per&s;on al&s;o, that a ju&s;t portrait of one might give a &s;triking re&s;em|blance of the other. They were of the &s;ame age to a day, and retained, in the &s;ame degree, the remains of tho&s;e graces, which time it&s;elf &s;eemed reluctant to de&s;troy. Their very features, had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, tri|umphed over the tyrant who is, figuratively, &s;aid to rejoice in the ruins of mortality; and their eyes, of the &s;ame deep and lu&s;trous colour, &s;till retained much of their pene|trating and &s;hining power.</P>
<P>Their virtues might be divided, as &s;ome have divided virtue it&s;elf, into Benevolence, Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance; and from like motives of divi&s;ion: becau&s;e, Benevolence propo&s;es good ends, Prudence &s;ugge&s;ts the be&s;t means of attaining them, Fortitude enables us to encounter the di&s;|couragements that &s;tand in our way, and Temperance repels, and over-comes the pa&s;&s;ions that ob&s;truct our progre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">Sir Armine brought with him, into holy orders, all the principle nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e the precepts they enjoin. A &s;incere belief in tho&s;e precepts formed, indeed, the mo&s;t exalted ingredient in his worldly happine&s;s; and the example of his life finely illu&s;trated his doctrine, if we except the prime error that &s;haded his character&mdash;a very &s;trong tincture of bigotry in matters of religion.</P>
<P>As a private gentleman, his character and conduct might very ju&s;tly be &s;ummed up, in the words of the celebrated Lord Clarendon; he maintained the primitive in|tegrity of the Engli&s;h nation, and &s;upported in his Ca&s;tle the good old manners, old good humour, and old good nature, of old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Three Sons had the happine&s;s of call|ing Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton their parents; and when the characters of the&s;e young men began to form, that of Henry &s;eemed to be compounded of properties that u&s;ually con&s;titute very contrary di&s;po&s;itions. His mind &s;ometimes &s;unk to the thicke&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="13">melancholy, &s;ometimes flamed with irritable ardour, then took a &s;oft intermediate &s;hade between both of the&s;e extremes; and then &s;oared again to the bolde&s;t heights of poetic enthu&s;ia&s;m; now rapid and uncontrolable, and now obedient to command, a fancy &s;uddenly catching fire, and as &s;uddenly becoming extingui&s;hed in &s;olemn meditation. Such were the tints that &s;eparated him from his brother John.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to be every body's favourite" &s;aid John, frowning as in &s;corn! "for then mu&s;t I a&s;&s;ociate with fools and knaves; and how am I to di&s;tingui&s;h the wi&s;e, and hone&s;t, but by giving them my time and company?" "I do not &s;ee that is at all nece&s;|&s;ary," an&s;wered Henry, &s;miling; "civi|lity does not imply univer&s;al a&s;&s;ociation; nor general good manners particular regard."</P>
<P>"Flattery is vice, but &s;uavity is virtue," &s;aid Henry: on this maxim he invited and conciliated. Before he opened his lips, his air gave promi&s;e of redre&s;s to the injured,
<PB N="6" REF="14">protection to the helple&s;s, and friend&s;hip to the worthy. John, according to a more &s;tern hypothe&s;is, was di&s;tant in his addre&s;s to mo&s;t men, to &s;ome inacce&s;&s;ible. This had an in|fluence no le&s;s on their minds, than on their manners, and even &s;imilar qualities were thereby di&s;tinctly coloured.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, the courage of Henry was, like his other virtues, animated by more pre|cipitation, and more conformable to the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit, the poetic romance of his character; but then, the&s;e threw over it a kind of popular and chivalric &s;plendour that dazzled while it warmed. No le&s;s daring and heroic, John was more methodical, more cor|rect, more deliberate, and he often retained his &s;kill, of no le&s;s importance in conte&s;t than ardour, even when his antagoni&s;t had lo&s;t all &s;cience in a &s;torm of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Their per&s;ons, however, were uniformly in keeping with their di&s;po&s;itions. They were both the favourites of Nature; yet even in externals &s;he had di&s;played her accu&s;tomed love of variety. John was &s;trong and mu&s;cular, but without corpulence, lofty without &s;toop|ing,
<PB N="7" REF="15">and of maje&s;tic &s;tature, without being unwieldy. Henry was elegantly proportioned, and exhibited a delicacy neither incon&s;i&s;tent with agility of body, or activity of mind. The eyes of each were dark, but &s;parkled with appropriate intelligence. Tho&s;e of John, by a permanent in&s;pection, never gave their object the relief of a moment. Their per&s;e|verance, in ca&s;es of doubt or difficulty, was &s;o determined, that, neither the mo&s;t hardened guilt, nor the mo&s;t con&s;cious innocence, could endure their &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>On the contrary, Henry's appeared to com|pa&s;s every thing by a glance, and the object under their ray frequently &s;uffered as much from the intolerable brightne&s;s of their fla&s;h, which was &s;udden and impetuous, as from the more &s;low and immitigable look of his brother.</P>
<P>The &s;eparating marks al&s;o extended to language, accent, and effect. Love and pity breathed in the voice of Henry: in com|pa&s;&s;ion he wept him&s;elf, and others wept with him; nor did mirth even be&s;tow on him a &s;mile, or &s;orrow a tear, which he did
<PB N="8" REF="16">not repay with intere&s;t. His features, bor|rowing their ca&s;t and colour from the &s;ubject, pre&s;ented moral and per&s;onal beauty, under a thou&s;and different forms and tintings; &s;ome|times di&s;covering ideas, light, ea&s;y, and full of fire, and &s;ometimes anticipating &s;entiments more weighty and profound. The&s;e were &s;et off by an ingenuous feeling of diffidence, which now painted his cheek with the bloom of the ro&s;e, and now with more than the lily's palene&s;s.</P>
<P>The countenance of John, on the other hand, was florid from con&s;titution, and pale only from inten&s;ity of thought, or agony of &s;en&s;ation. In his voice there was neither melody nor per&s;ua&s;ion; but tones of &s;uch authority, expre&s;&s;ion; &s;o firm, and &s;en&s;e &s;o un|ob&s;tructed, perhaps he deemed it unnece&s;&s;ary to court the attention he knew he could com|mand. The living volume of Nature, even from his earlie&s;t youth, had been his principal &s;tudy; and the knowledge which is thence derived to the mind, was alone thought wor|thy of his contemplation: whereas, Henry was impatient of toil, and &s;eemed to mount
<PB N="9" REF="17">on the pinion of the eagle to e&s;cape from every ta&s;k impo&s;ed. John rarely con|de&s;cended to trifle, while Henry had the happy art of rendering every trifle intere&s;t|ing: what&s;oever he touched, though dull, and dro&s;&s;y before, acquired, by the alchemy of genius, &s;ome &s;hining quality.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;econd brother, al|though his &s;hare in that part of the family tran&s;actions de&s;igned to form the following hi&s;tory, was only occa&s;ional; he was, in &s;ome important in&s;tances, &s;o interwoven with his relatives, that a neglect of his character would be not more di&s;re&s;pectful to him than in|jurious to the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The per&s;on of James Fitzorton, had neither the &s;trength of his elder, nor the elegance of his younger brother, being of the middle &s;ize between both. His eyes varied in colour, as in expre&s;&s;ion, from tho&s;e already de&s;cribed; they had not the &s;earching power of John's, nor the brilliancy of Henry's; but were a pair of grey, full &s;et, u&s;eful, hone&s;t optics, not de&s;titute of meaning. His complexion was neither &s;o fair as Henry's, nor &s;o dark as
<PB N="10" REF="18">John's; and his di&s;po&s;ition was a ju&s;t, and not &s;eldom a nece&s;&s;ary, equipoi&s;e between the exce&s;&s;es of Henry's natural &s;en&s;ibility, and John's artificial government of him&s;elf. Na|ture had formed his mind as &s;he: had modelled his per&s;on; in the middle way, be|tween the fraternal extremes: a mediocrity which, however humble, had its u&s;e in the family; &s;ometimes checking the impetuous effu&s;ions of Henry, &s;ometimes attempering the &s;aturnine habits of John. In &s;hort, a very proper middle man to be placed between two &s;uch extremes.</P>
<P>Yet the wide diver&s;ity of life could &s;carcely furni&s;h a circum&s;tance in which their modes of conduct were &s;imilar, even when their mo|tives were the &s;ame. Their characteri&s;tics began to &s;hew them&s;elves in the mo&s;t early, and continued to the late&s;t period. From the former, we will &s;elect an almo&s;t infantine occurrence, becau&s;e it a&s;certained their in|delible points: the &s;oft exce&s;s of Henry, the moderation of James, and the energy of John.</P>
<P>In the cold &s;ea&s;on, a poor blackbird had
<PB N="11" REF="19">taken &s;helter in Sir Armine's green-hou&s;e. Animated by the genial heat, it was ba&s;king upon an orange-tree, and warmed out of the cold remembrances of time and place, &s;tretch|ed out its wings, in a kind of &s;ummer languor over the branches, and had begun to pour a &s;emi-note of gratitude and joy. Henry, ha&s;tily, yet on tip-toe, ran round to &s;hut the window at which it had entered, fir&s;t clo&s;ing the door. "I have wi&s;hed for a blackbird I know not how long", whi&s;pered he, "and it will be quite a charity to give that poor fellow good winter quarters in the ca&s;tle. I own, it is almo&s;t a pity to di&s;turb him now, he &s;eems &s;o com|fortable; but if he knew how very kindly I would u&s;e him, he would come a volunteer into my chamber." "Very kind to be &s;ure," &s;aid John, "to make him a &s;lave for life; to my thoughts, he had better choo&s;e his own lodging, though the be&s;t to be had were in a barn, or in a hollow tree, and get an indepen|dent warm here in the hot-hou&s;e, when he finds an opportunity, than be a pri&s;oner in the be&s;t room of the ca&s;tle, nay, in the king's
<PB N="12" REF="20">palace; &s;o be advi&s;ed brother, and let him alone."</P>
<P>John &s;oftly opened part of the window neare&s;t the bird. "No, I'll tell you how it &s;hall be," ob&s;erved little James,&mdash;" give the bird fair play; leave the window open, and let Harry try his fortune; if the bird &s;uffers him&s;elf to be caught, when the path of free|dom is before his eyes, why it will be his own affair you know." "But the act of catching him at all is arbitrary," &s;aid John&mdash;&s;turdily throw|ing his hat at the orange, and other exotic plants, that grew in the direction of the tree where the blackbird had been perched. "Not at all brother," cried Henry, "when it is only to convey him to a better place"&mdash;running, as he &s;pake, after the object of his wi&s;hes, almo&s;t with the &s;wiftne&s;s of its own wings. John kept always behind, in the hope of pointing its flight to the window, and James &s;tood im|partially in the middle, unle&s;s he &s;tept on one &s;ide or the other, to maintain fair deal|ing. The blackbird, mean time, alarmed by all parties, flew, irregularly, from &s;hrub to &s;hrub, from window to window, &s;ometimes
<PB N="13" REF="21">beating its brea&s;t again&s;t one object, &s;ome|times &s;triking its wing or beak again&s;t an|other, often being in the very path of liberty, and as often driven out of it. At length it &s;ank exhau&s;ted to the ground, and was taken up almo&s;t without an effort to flutter, by Henry, who&s;e little heart palpitated like its own. His ardent eye, quick breathing lip, and high colouring cheek, &s;poke his triumphs; yet amid&s;t his exultings, he forgot not mercy: the faire&s;t laurel of the conqueror, is huma|nity; and the very in&s;tincts of Henry were humane. He &s;moothed the ruffled plumes of his captive; poured over it every a&s;&s;urance of protection; pre&s;&s;ed its glo&s;&s;y pinion on his cheek; detained it with a &s;oft trembling hand, and at length putting it, lightly held, into his bo&s;om, ran with it to his chamber. "He has fairly won the bird, brother," &s;aid James, fol|lowing. "Certainly," replied John, with a di&s;&s;atisfied tone, "nothing can be fairer, than to run down a poor terrified little wretch, who has no power to re&s;i&s;t; then &s;eizing and drag|ging it to pri&s;on! It &s;truggled for freedom, till it was almo&s;t ga&s;ping for breath; and I
<PB N="14" REF="22">am a&s;hamed, that I &s;uffered any thing to prevent my taking part with the unpro|tected in the cau&s;e of liberty. But this, I &s;uppo&s;e, you and my brother would call foul play, ju&s;t as you have &s;tyled his theft a kind|ne&s;s! Yes, the kindne&s;s of a chri&s;tian robber, who &s;teals the innocent &s;avage from his native land, and covers him with chains!"</P>
<P>Dreading the lo&s;s of his trea&s;ure, Henry guarded it with a mi&s;er's care; kept it con|cealed in his own room; but treated it with the utmo&s;t indulgence, being at once its nur&s;e and companion, and &s;uffering no hand but his own to feed it. "Alas! it droops," &s;aid its protector&mdash;bringing it down one day into an apartment where his brothers were &s;itting&mdash; "what can be done for it, James?" que&s;tioned he, with tears in his eyes. "Let it go," inter|po&s;ed John; "it pines for the friends from who&s;e &s;ociety it has been ravi&s;hed; it langui&s;hes for freedom: let it go, and it will &s;oon recover." "Perhaps," an&s;wered James, "it only wants more air, your chamber may be too con|fined: Suppo&s;e then," continued he,&mdash;willing to compromi&s;e betwixt liberty and &s;lavery,&mdash;
<PB N="15" REF="23">"you were to tie a &s;ilken &s;tring round its leg, and lead it now and then about the garden?" "I propo&s;e an improvement on that idea," &s;aid John&mdash;"clip one of its wings, and as you per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing it its right to fly in the air, let it have the run of the garden; that on the &s;outh &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, you know, is walled round, and it cannot walk off." He reconciled Henry to this mea&s;ure, by telling him that it would produce many good ends, be&s;ides re|&s;toring the blackbird's health, and giving it a reli&s;h of its former enjoyments; among&s;t other things he a&s;&s;ured him, that it would recover its &s;pirits, which would enable it to whi&s;tle back its lo&s;t friends and relations. Henry could not re&s;i&s;t this: the idea of giving joy to others, was a joy to his own heart; the action by which it was be&s;towed, could alone &s;urpa&s;s it.</P>
<P>In effect, the bird was all the better for its liberty; it hopped, pecked, twittered, and daily appeared to gain new vi&s;itors. There was in the walled garden, a &s;hed, where it ne&s;tled towards evening; but Henry, with &s;oft &s;teps, would take care while it re|po&s;ed,
<PB N="16" REF="24">to &s;trew food on the ground below, &s;o that it always found breakfa&s;t ready in the morning; nor was dinner, or &s;upper pro|vi&s;ion forgotten, &s;o that what it picked up in the garden was mere amu&s;ement to reli&s;h exerci&s;e. The kind-hearted Henry was <HI>per|fectly</HI> &s;atisfied with this plan: John was only <HI>half</HI> &s;atisfied. James prudently &s;ugge&s;ted giving the growing wing another cutting. Henry agreed; for his favourite could now take half the garden at a low flight, though not top the walls. "Wait a little longer" &s;aid John: "He is &s;o tame, and &s;o well plea&s;ed with his pre&s;ent u&s;age, that perhaps he will indeed be a volunteer among&s;t us, and there will be a thou&s;and times the gratification in having his &s;ociety with his own con&s;ent." "But if he &s;hould leave me?" &s;aid Henry. "Have confidence in him; think how delight|ful it is to have friend&s;hip as a free-will offer|ing: I &s;hould hate any thing I forced to &s;tay with me, as much as it could hate me. Can a jail bird love the jailor?" "I have a good mind to tru&s;t it," ob&s;erved Henry; "but I &s;ometimes think it looks up at the walls very
<PB N="17" REF="25">&s;ly."&mdash;" That is nothing but a way they have with them," &s;aid John, laughing. "What is your opinion James?" que&s;tioned Henry. "There can be, I &s;hould think, but one opi|nion about that," replied James, taking out a little pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. "O, he always was for cutting out, ju&s;t like a girl; but act a more liberal part my brother," &s;aid John; Henry was over-ruled. The feathers grew, and the blackbird flew away. Henry accu&s;ed; John defended; James mediated. The grateful bird, however, &s;taid in the neighbourhood; &s;ang better, looked happier; Henry was, therefore, reconciled to his lo&s;s, and John was at length contented. He was, indeed, nearer the age of mingling reflection with &s;en&s;ation, being &s;ix years older than James, who was Henry's &s;enior only by eighteen months; but the&s;e traits of childhood remained fixed. As life advanced, John determined to inve&s;t rea|&s;on with the honours of that &s;overeignty which the morali&s;ts have a&s;&s;igned her, and which "can bear no rival near her throne." "The Pa&s;&s;ions," &s;aid he, "&s;hould be treated as good, or di&s;loyal &s;ubjects; the fir&s;t with indulgence,
<PB N="18" REF="26">the la&s;t with rigour; &s;o will I govern them." James was nearly of the &s;ame way of think|ing, except that he was di&s;po&s;ed to a more equal di&s;tribution, both of puni&s;hments and rewards. But Henry generally felt more than he rea&s;oned; yet of the maje&s;ty and preroga|tive of the rational power, he had ideas even more &s;ublime than either of his brothers; but a more ardent temperament, and a fancy more vivid, made it more difficult to keep the pa&s;&s;ions within the line of their privileges. "My dear Harry," quoth John, "you do not think enough."&mdash;" My dear John, I &s;uppo&s;e my thinking time is not yet come; but it appears to me, at pre&s;ent, that if you would not &s;uffer your thoughts to be &s;uch &s;pies upon your feelings, you would be &s;ometimes a much happier boy," replied Henry. "Much oftener the rever&s;e, I believe," re&s;umed John; "but &s;hould I be wi&s;er and better?" "For my part," ob&s;erved James&mdash;who was &s;tand|ing between them, and taking a hand of each,&mdash;"if we could always be as near one another as we are now, we &s;hould get on bravely."</P>

<P>SUCH were the Sons of Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton: And when the&s;e young men might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have gained &s;ome ac|quaintance with them&s;elves, and with that would mo&s;t contribute to their happine&s;s, their father convened them to meet in that apartment of the ca&s;tle, which had always been &s;acred to pious meditation, or parental coun&s;el. The Brothers being a&s;&s;embled, he addre&s;&s;ed them thus: "Dear, very dear objects of my equal affections! you have now had time to cultivate that &s;elf know|ledge, which may a&s;&s;ift you, in choo&s;ing the paths, in which ye may go with the mo&s;t honour to your&s;elves and profit to others. A life of idlene&s;s is u&s;ele&s;s at be&s;t, and of what it is at wor&s;t I would not wi&s;h to give your pure minds any idea. Select then &s;ome object which may keep in virtuous, and whole&s;ome occupation, your minds and bodies. I am aware that this important matter has been deferred beyond the u&s;ual
<PB N="20" REF="28">date, at which it becomes a &s;ubject of arrange|ment, betwixt parents and their children; but, I think, it is generally brought into di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion too early. How can a ju&s;t notion of human conduct be acquired before the human character is in &s;ome mea&s;ure formed? and until nature has had uncontrolled opportunity to point out her bias? I de&s;ired to make &s;ilent ob&s;ervation on that bias as publick or private occurrence called it forth; that when it be|came a deciding and important que&s;tion, if I thought of your choice le&s;s favourably than you did, I might offer &s;uch rea&s;ons as would &s;atisfy your minds, that my objections were grounded not on paternal tyranny, but fatherly love.</P>
<P>"Perhaps I am by this delay competent to an&s;wer my own que&s;tion, even as you would an&s;wer it. There can be little doubt, I think, that you, my elde&s;t hope and ble&s;&s;ing, will decide for the &s;enatorial character, which is highly favourable to your argumentative powers, and no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the profound re&s;earches of a philo&s;ophical mind. Your wi&s;h, James, I can &s;ee, will take an active part in the admini&s;tration of public
<PB N="21" REF="29">ju&s;tice, and you may, in due time, unite the &s;enator with the legi&s;lator. There is an equanimity and poi&s;e in your di&s;po&s;ition, which in both the&s;e high offices is of the la&s;t importance: And my Henry's election will probably be that of his happy father; be|cau&s;e without any in fringement of the pa&s;toral, which I am convinced will be con&s;idered as the primary duties, he may cultivate the mu&s;e; and &s;he is not more the adorner of &s;ocial life than the hand-maid of Religion, when under the direction of that aweful power.</P>
<P>"Tell me then, deare&s;t honours of my life, if in the&s;e conjectures I have anticipated your wi&s;hes?"&mdash;John and James replied in the affirmative. Henry &s;tifled a &s;igh in a cough, but his a&s;&s;ent was included. "Nothing then remains but to gratify them,"&mdash;continued the venerable man, his voice attuned, and his look &s;oftened to his expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;"And may ye, in all good things, be thus unanimous. Your election made, you will with general purity of life, connect and improve the parti|cular qualifications which are requi&s;ite, and
<PB N="22" REF="30">it will be my delightful care to give them effect.</P>
<P>"But there is another topick; I mean that of your patrimonial fortune. In the di&s;tribu|tion of this I &s;hould, by &s;ome parents, be thought as much to oppo&s;e the opinions and practice of the world, as in having con&s;ulted you on the choice of life, I mean with re&s;pect to dates of con&s;ultation and of di&s;tribution; yet nothing can be more certain than that one principle governs me in both; for as, I think, young people are called upon to fix their profe&s;&s;ion much too early, I am of opinion, likewi&s;e, that the knowledge and adju&s;tment of their inheritance, exclu&s;ively of what may be derived from &s;uch profe&s;&s;ion, comes to them too late. When youths are really capa|ble of &s;electing the grand object of their future pur&s;uit, as members of the commu|nity, the degree of judgment, which ren|ders them competent to this, fits them to be tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of their inheritance; unle&s;s, indeed, filial profligacy has made paternal confidence imprudent; but, in my bleffed ca&s;e, where the un&s;ullied blo&s;&s;om
<PB N="23" REF="31">gives promi&s;e of the faire&s;t fruit, in due fea&s;on, and has grown into no wanton luxuri|ance by the warme&s;t influence of parental &s;uns,&mdash;you &s;ee, my Henry, I, like you, con|&s;ider poetick imagery &s;ometimes an auxiliary to the di&s;play of truth,&mdash;I can have nothing to fear! Ah no! from dividing among&s;t you my little &s;tores in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and pre-acquaint|ing you, with tho&s;e in expectance, I have every thing to hope."</P>
<P>The young men took their eyes from their father, and looked at each other.</P>
<P>"It might perhaps be good policy in parents to make their children not only wi&s;h the ex|ten&s;ion of their lives, on motives of natural affection, but on tho&s;e of worldly intere&s;t, and it &s;eems to me there is nothing tends &s;o much to&mdash;I will not &s;ay <HI>forgetfulne&s;s</HI> of the parental tie, for that is a mo&s;t tremendous extreme,&mdash;but to &s;educing the heart's mo&s;t &s;acred comfort&mdash;<HI>humanely</HI> &s;peaking&mdash;to an act of <HI>mere duty</HI> as a &s;ordid attention to what may be gained by a parent's death! It may force the be&s;t children to grow indifferent about the life of him who gave life to them; and it undoubtedly makes children of le&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="32">happy di&s;po&s;itions much wor&s;e; for as kind|ne&s;s begets affection, there can be little doubt that rigour, if it cannot extingui&s;h the &s;enti|ment of natural affection, impairs its plea&s;ure, and ob&s;tructs its energy.</P>
<P>"That it may &s;till be the heart-felt wi&s;h of my dear boys, that their fond father, aged as he is, &s;hould yet live to &s;ee their happine&s;s; I will to-morrow pre&s;ent a &s;tatement of our mutual property; I &s;ay <HI>mutual,</HI> becau&s;e I have invariably con&s;idered it as held only in tru&s;t for them and their beloved mother; and, though there have been &s;ome entanglements, I hope to prove I have been a faithful family &s;teward; and, indeed, my children, that is the only character in which it &s;hould be a father's ambition to appear.</P>
<P>"For one of you," continued he, looking at Henry, "will, I tru&s;t, a&s;cend the &s;ummit of fortune; but equal in the affection of my nature, your patrimonial rights are indepen|dent of adventitious aid, and &s;hould be equa|lized al&s;o; did not the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to a family title, to which is attached the decent dignity of an ancient hou&s;e, make &s;ome extraordinary &s;upply nece&s;&s;ary to my &s;on John."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="33">John, who &s;eemed le&s;s to reli&s;h the ar|rangement than either of his brothers, put a negative &s;o &s;olemn on this that it e&s;tabli&s;hed his point, notwith&s;tanding Sir Armine &s;trug|gled with a frown: James maintained the &s;ilence which often waits on affecting emo|tions; and Henry had been weeping &s;ome time. The father's frown melted away.</P>
<P>"Be it &s;o then," rejoined Sir Armine, giving, at length, a &s;miling &s;anction to his elde&s;t &s;on's negative. John bowed re&s;pect|fully, and declared, in his laconic way, that the hou&s;e &s;hould be &s;upported.&mdash;"But how my dear boy?" a&s;ked his father, giving yet more force to his &s;mile, "philo&s;ophy is rather apt to neglect the &s;ublunary contemplations of brick and mortar, records and rent-rolls, courts-leet, and courts-baron."&mdash;"Then poetry, Sir," exclaimed Henry, with glowing cheeks, "&s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t!"&mdash;"Wor&s;e and wor&s;e!" cried Sir Armine, broadening the &s;mile into a laugh; "the Mu&s;e, you know Harry, con&s;iders Ruins as her be&s;t materials; di&s;mantled towers, a broken column, a moul|dering wall, dilapidated man&s;ions, and ca&s;tles in confu&s;ion, &s;erve but as the &s;cenery of
<PB N="26" REF="34">her pictures, and it is well a votary of frag|ment-loving Phoebus is not heir to this old Fitz|orton fabric." "But in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, Sir," &s;aid James, "I tru&s;t dome&s;tic equity would not be thought unprofe&s;&s;ional." "Nor," interpo&s;ed John, adopting parlia|mentary language, "&s;hall I, &s;urely, be called to <HI>order,</HI>" bowing to Sir Armine, and giving a hand to each of his brothers, "or be thought <HI>unparliamentary,</HI> if I enter a <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t any &s;uch <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI>&mdash;as I apprehend it very po&s;&s;ible for a little di&s;cretion, and &s;aving in &s;uperfluities, no way, I hope, incompatible with the dignity either of Philo&s;ophy or the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, to grant me the &s;upplies requi&s;ite for the dignity of my <HI>own</HI> hou&s;e, without <HI>levying burthens,</HI> or rai&s;ing <HI>contributions,</HI> on my <HI>allies.</HI> Not," added John, qualifying the former independent notions; "not that I &s;hould proudly re&s;i&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary; neither would I unnaturally, in &s;uch ca&s;es, go out of my own hou&s;e to maintain its honours."</P>
<P>The brothers joined hands.</P>
<P>"Well, well," an&s;wered the father, "I &s;ee there is little danger of our good old man&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="35"><HI>falling,</HI> in any &s;en&s;e of the word, while the Virtues, Arts, and Nature her&s;elf, are re&s;olved to &s;upport it."</P>
<P>"O!" cried Henry, "may it want no other pillar, for many a &s;miling year, than the &s;acred one which has long, and, ah! ble&s;&s;ed be God, &s;till pre&s;erves, unimpaired, its beauty and its, &s;trength."</P>
<P>"Dear boy!" exclaimed his father.</P>
<P>"Henry has &s;poken for us all," ob&s;erved John to James.</P>
<P>"With &s;uperior eloquence," an&s;wered the latter.</P>
<P>And a&s;&s;erted the former, "with equal &s;ince|rity, ble&s;&s;ings on our father! But he is too good."</P>
<P>Here the &s;ons dropt on their knees.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ings on my children!" ejaculated Sir Armine, rai&s;ing them; his accents more tender than di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The brothers, during this conference, were &s;upporting, and &s;upported by their truly venerable Sire: a &s;oft pau&s;e en&s;ued, and they withdrew.</P>

<P>THE next day was taken up in &s;ettling the propo&s;ed independencies of the&s;e young men; and as John &s;turdily maintained the right of equal divi&s;ion, both immediate and rever&s;ionary, his father no longer re&s;i&s;ted. He laid before his children the rent-roll of his e&s;tates. He neither concealed the prodigalities of &s;ome, nor failed to dwell on the prudence of others of his ance&s;tors; he did not hide his own indi&s;cretions; they were chiefly generous ones, &s;ince the property came into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: In &s;hort, he di&s;clo&s;ed every thing that might operate on their impre&s;&s;ive minds in the way of emulation, or of e&s;cape. What he deemed was not yet ripe for di&s;covery he re&s;erved, and at the clo&s;e of the conference he &s;aid: "Dear youths, I have now developed to you tho&s;e things which fathers too often con&s;ider as Family &s;ecrets, till their bodies are moulder|ing in the grave. I have unfolded my&s;elf to the hearts of my children, and put into their
<PB N="29" REF="37">hands the means of being ju&s;t and generous, wi&s;e and good. You have always been free to think. You will be now free to act. The three deeds I now deliver will &s;hew, that though the &s;treams are amply &s;upplied the &s;acred fountains are by no means exhau&s;ted; my &s;ons, we may henceforward form a little re|public of our own, and enjoy the whole&s;ome freedom &s;o e&s;&s;ential to a commonwealth. It has, indeed, been my endeavour to train you to independent thoughts, that on their ba&s;is you might con&s;truct independent actions; for nothing honourable, nothing noble, in truth, nothing natural, can proceed from minds &s;lavi&s;hly controuled."</P>
<P>Here Lady Fitzorton made her appear|ance, and embracing her &s;ons, &s;milingly, con|firmed their e&s;tabli&s;hment. Sir Armine, by way of giving a &s;olemn fini&s;hing of the whole, reque&s;ted that the ble&s;&s;ing of God Almighty might be humbly implored on the arrange|ments of the morning, ob&s;erving, that no work could be deemed conclu&s;ive, or good, until ratified by prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="38">The parents went out together; Sir Armine &s;aying he &s;hould expect them in an hour in the private chapel of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations of Henry, as u&s;ual, crim|&s;oned his cheek, and bathed his eyes, while they enchained his tongue: from &s;imilar, and on this occa&s;ion, equal &s;en&s;ibility, James, al&s;o, was &s;ilent; but a doubt aro&s;e in the always &s;crutinizing mind of the elder brother. When John had reached the porch of the chapel he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: "Warmed, and hum|bled, by the genero&s;ity of the propo&s;al, are we, my brothers, perfectly right in accept|ing the&s;e a&s;&s;ignments in Sir Armine's life time?" "Good heaven!" exclaimed Henry, "how un|dutiful a thought!" "It &s;trikes me, however, as a ju&s;t one: Is it fit or proper to &s;uffer our father to put us in a manner out of his power; the power of re&s;training our vice &s;hould we degenerate?"</P>
<P>"Vice! how can you &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible brother John? Will not what the be&s;t of men and of parents has done, be at once a pre|ventive from evil, and an encouragement to good?"</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="39">"I am not upon &s;uch good terms with my|&s;elf, brother Henry. The love we bear to a parent ought, perhaps, like that we owe to our heavenly father, to be attempered and cha&s;tened by fear. And if the latter be de|&s;troyed, I am not &s;ure that the other may not pre&s;ume a little too much."</P>
<P>"And," an&s;wered Henry, "&s;hall I reve|rence &mdash;methinks <HI>that,</HI> brother, is the better word&mdash;&s;hall I reverence my beloved father le&s;s for conduct that not only endears but exalts him? If I before loved and honoured, &s;hall I not now venerate? &s;hall I not adore him?"</P>
<P>"I hope not brother: That dear father will tell you, adoration belongs to another parent; not that we will &s;tand here upon the thre&s;hold of the Temple of the Mo&s;t High to contend about words, or to critici&s;e the hyperboles of a mu&s;e-&s;truck mind&mdash;I give that mind credit for its &s;incerity on this &s;ubject, even among&s;t all the vi&s;ions of poe&s;y&mdash;but, in human life, there is always a po&s;&s;ibility of the wor&s;t of human errors&mdash;that wor&s;t is ingratitude."</P>
<P>James admitted this, but thought there might be a medium&mdash;half the intended bounty
<PB N="32" REF="40">given to their di&s;cretion, and half retained by the father, as an experiment. "And of this vice the &s;ublime, if &s;ublimity can apply to atro|cious deeds, is ingratitude filial," continued John, throwing out his &s;econd brother's amendment. The whole ma&s;s of Henry's generous blood &s;eemed to undergo a &s;udden revul&s;ion&mdash;"Brother, brother, how can you have &s;uffered a thought &s;o unnatural to enter your bo&s;om!" "And has not your poetical reading then," retorted John, "furni&s;hed you with an example of its being among&s;t the po&s;&s;ible &s;tains in human nature?&mdash;Have you forgot the &s;tory of children under our very cir|cum&s;tances? &mdash;and is not that &s;tory recorded by Nature's mo&s;t profound Poet and Hi&s;to|rian? &mdash;were not Lear's daughters as ten|derly care&s;&s;ed, as amply accommodated, as fondly confided in, as the &s;ons of Sir Armine Fitzorton?&mdash;Think, brother, on what <HI>has</HI> been; tremble for what <HI>may</HI> be."</P>
<P>"Oh! if I could believe my&s;elf," exclaimed Henry, reddening, "capable of making a return like their's, my prayer would be to prevent that capacity by immediate death,
<PB N="33" REF="41">brother&mdash;even on the &s;acred &s;pot whereon I now &s;tand! Ingratitude to my father! O! God!"</P>
<P>"God forbid!" an&s;wered John, "any of us &s;hould be capable of it&mdash;but I am always more afraid of my&s;elf than of any body el&s;e; and as I dare not put much tru&s;t in my own nature, nor have had, as yet, any expe|rience how command will operate on minds accu&s;tomed to obey, I could wi&s;h the entire <HI>authority</HI> of a father had &s;till accompanied his <HI>affection;</HI> and that he might have granted, or denied, our wi&s;hes, in&s;tead of yielding us up to tho&s;e who may be di&s;po&s;ed to deny too little, and grant too much."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h brother John," &s;aid Henry, "you had not put an image &s;o painful into my mind. It is enough to make one turn an eye of &s;u&s;pi|cion on one&s;elf."</P>
<P>"There can be no great harm in that," an&s;|wered John. "A citadel is not the le&s;s &s;ecure for &s;u&s;pecting there may be an enemy lurking within the walls, and thereupon doubly urging the commander to vigilance; for my part,
<PB N="34" REF="42">I already &s;ee enough of human nature to know it cannot be too well watched."</P>
<P>"On the contrary, brother," argued Henry, "the more credit we give to our&s;elves, or others, the le&s;s will our faith be abu&s;ed. Who will take an unfair advantage of genero&s;ity? and, indeed, there are many &s;ituations in which confidence begets honour:&mdash;The tru&s;ted man will be emulous to prove him&s;elf tru&s;t worthy."</P>
<P>Sir Armine, attended by his Lady, now join|ed the youths.&mdash;"My &s;ons let us proceed to the chapel, and there commemorate a day which, I hope, will be one of the mo&s;t joyful of my life."</P>
<P>"I believe it from my inmo&s;t &s;oul" cried Henry.</P>
<P>"I hope it from the bottom of mine," &s;aid James, "and betwixt generous hope, and pious fear, our virtue may be &s;afe.</P>

<P>The re&s;t of the evening was employed in &s;ports innocently fe&s;tive, or in reflections &s;uit|able to the tran&s;actions of the day; and at night, from the full, but not overflowing, bowl of temperance, &s;ucce&s;s was wi&s;hed and drank to the Senate, the Pulpit, and the Bar&mdash; and the &s;econd round to John, Henry, and James Fitzorton.</P>
<P>In the morning, however, John, who in|herited his father's tenacity, and always main|tained that if a parent had prerogative, a child had privileges, formally re&s;umed his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the grand que&s;tion, Whether a child's being made independent of the father, during the life of the latter, was fit and proper to be acceded to; and, after arguing the ca&s;e various ways,
<PB N="36" REF="44">brought his brothers &s;o thoroughly into his way of thinking, it was, at length, re&s;olved, <HI>nem. con.</HI> that how generous &s;oever it might be for a parent to offer, it was indecorous in a child to receive, what &s;hould be, from time to time, be&s;towed in reward, or withheld in puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>This deci&s;ion was followed by a &s;olemn &s;urrender of their independencies. The three &s;ons having de&s;ired, and obtained, an audi|ence, the deeds of gift were pre&s;ented on their knees. John, for him&s;elf and his bro|thers, explained, with reverence and humility, the motive. "Your children, Sir, entreat you will not deprive them of the greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s they can enjoy in this world&mdash;that of your di&s;pen&s;ing your benevolence to them, according to their de&s;ervings&mdash;they feel over|whelmed and embarra&s;&s;ed with the &s;udden po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o important a &s;um; and that from your hand alone, they could be content ro receive it."</P>
<P>Sir Armine's parental &s;overeignty was here|in &s;o ably &s;oftened away, that he was &s;ubdued without perceiving he had been oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45">Indeed, although this unexpected circum|&s;tance cut up by the root the benevolent de&s;ign which the worthy prie&s;t had long cheri&s;hed; he &s;o clearly &s;aw into the motives of the mover, that, with the agreeable flat|tery, he accepted the relinqui&s;hment of his children's rights, though given back within a few hours after they had been &s;ettled. Each of the &s;ons had his own argument in favour of the mea&s;ure. John, the propo&s;er, declared his approbation of it, becau&s;e it was philo|&s;ophically agreeable to the nature of things. James found it worthy of adoption, becau&s;e he was happy to be removed from the danger of running into extremes. Henry played with the &s;ubject, after his own airy and agreeable manner, and &s;ettled his &s;atisfaction by a copy of ver&s;es, in which he a&s;&s;erted, that from the parent &s;ource, the &s;treams of bounty would be di&s;pen&s;ed by &s;uperior wi&s;dom, fertilize every flower of the fancy by due &s;upplies, and invigorate the virtues, tho&s;e fruits of the heart.</P>
<P>Sir Armine undertook the in&s;truction of his &s;ons, in all the elementary knowledge that
<PB N="38" REF="46">could prepare them for their de&s;tined pro|fe&s;&s;ions. The reverend preceptor, wi&s;ely and whole&s;omely divided the day into equal parts, for the purpo&s;es of &s;erious &s;tudy, amu&s;ing mental relaxation, and intermediate exerci&s;e. For a con&s;iderable time there were few deviations or interruptions in the&s;e in|tere&s;ting plea&s;ures, or pur&s;uits; although Henry cheri&s;hed a concealed di&s;inclination to the path which had been chalked out for him.</P>
<P>After the venerable teacher had &s;ettled the grand ba&s;is of morals and of religion, on which Sir Armine propo&s;ed to build the cha|racter of his &s;ons, he was anxious to give to their manners and external behaviour, which he con&s;idered as the &s;uper&s;tructure, every amiable embelli&s;hment; for, although &s;ome|what too tenacious of his own modes of faith, he was not of tho&s;e zealots who imagine the innocent adornments, either of the human figure or under&s;tanding, that render man &s;o intere&s;ting to man, incompatible with &s;piritual duty; but when his &s;on John expre&s;&s;ed an erudite &s;corn for all &s;ort of dre&s;s, beyond even
<PB N="39" REF="47">a coar&s;e &s;implicity, he ob&s;erved, obliquely, to Henry, "I take it extremely kind in your brother John, to labour as I perceive he doth, to reconcile the habit of a gentleman, with the mental dre&s;s of a &s;cholar. I dare &s;ay, a little more time will convince him, there is no good rea&s;on to be given, why a man of &s;cience &s;hould be a &s;loven. I am, in the &s;ame degree, flattered to &s;ee than you, Henry, have had the good &s;en&s;e to correct the contrary exce&s;s; an extreme attention to the fa&s;hion of the day is no le&s;s a fault, than a con|temptuous negligence. The <HI>&s;implex mun|ditiis</HI> of James, always gratified me. James bowed. John inclined his head al&s;o, but &s;tubbornly; and contended, that he could not &s;till help thinking the dre&s;&s;ing hour a heavy &s;acrifice of the immortal, to the animal part of man&mdash;and that not being to any good end, in &s;hortened a very &s;hort exi&s;tence. "By no means," urged his father; "in many in&s;tances it lengthens life; in all, it renders it more acceptable to &s;ociety, and more comfortable to our&s;elves."</P>
<P>"But then, Sir," argued the per&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="40" REF="48">John, "&s;uch &s;crubbing, &s;pruceing, trimming, &s;crapeing&mdash;&s;uch tayloring, perfumering, mantua-making&mdash;&s;uch a convolvement and tran&s;mutation of the quick and dead; of the natural living man, into the dried &s;kins and hides of dead bea&s;ts, and all this even before modern men and women are fit to be &s;een by one another! It humiliates one to think, that the verie&s;t in&s;ect or animal, which is mur|dered and &s;tripped to cover the &s;hivering favourite of creation, is le&s;s the &s;lave of con|tingence. The butterfly pa&s;&s;es in his robe of many colours, and mocks my patch-work finery. My &s;paniel &s;hakes his coat, and is dre&s;&s;ed without lo&s;s of time; but laborious man!"&mdash;"On the contrary," rejoined his fa|ther, "a habit of external neatne&s;s, renders all the labours of the toilette, in a great mea&s;ure, unnece&s;&s;ary; and I am of opinion, that the creature would not have been featured &s;o fair, fa&s;hioned with &s;o much harmony, nor endu|ed with a de&s;ire of appearing amiable and attractive to tho&s;e of his kind, with whom he is de&s;tined to a&s;&s;ociate, were it not plea&s;ing al&s;o to the Creator; and, methinks, it is as
<PB N="41" REF="49">much a contempt of God's gracious bounties, to &s;uffer that which is &s;aid to be expre&s;&s;ive of his &s;acred image, to be disfigured by filth; as for the &s;oul her&s;elf to be defiled by moral uncleanne&s;s."</P>
<P>John, though proud of intellectual inde|pendence, was &s;truck, not more by the purity, than the piety of this conclu&s;ive remark; and from that hour, to the late&s;t of his life, he was as attentive to exterior, as a being to whom is intru&s;ted the care of a body and a &s;oul ought to be.</P>

<P>THE di&s;&s;imilitude between John, James, and Henry, &s;trengthened as they grew: Henry continued un&s;u&s;pecting; John was more &s;u&s;picious and re&s;erved; James pre&s;erved a medium betwixt implicit confidence, and jealous caution. A compa&s;&s;ionate heart led John to relieve di&s;tre&s;s where&s;oever he found it; but he generally imputed even his own bounty to a degrading &s;ource; but then John had to number among&s;t his fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="42" REF="50">a deception on his heart. "It is my weakne&s;s, not my judgment," would he &s;ay, "my pa&s;&s;ion, not my rea&s;on, that &s;till di&s;po&s;es me to li&s;ten to tales of woe; not a word of which I be|lieve one time out of an hundred. I know, that all the joys, and all the mi&s;eries, all the pains, and all the plea&s;ures of life, with the tears and &s;miles that <HI>ought</HI> to be their hone&s;t and invariable &s;ignals, can be counterfeited! Limbs, which enjoy the fair proportions of nature, are di&s;torted to work on my huma|nity. Rags, and other appearances of the mo&s;t &s;qualid and abject poverty, are a&s;&s;umed as the be&s;t engines of deceit to procure riches to the idle, and debaucheries to the infamous. Infants are purcha&s;ed or &s;tolen, to multiply the appeals of the hypocrite; for every actual nece&s;&s;ity of almo&s;t every kind, mental and bodily, the benevolence of the land in which I live, has afforded its adequate &s;upply, and tho&s;e who are thru&s;t from its protection, either find an intere&s;t in continuing the trade of apparent di&s;tre&s;s, or are de&s;ervedly the outlaws of public compa&s;&s;ion. In more cul|tivated &s;ocieties, where, alas! di&s;&s;imulation
<PB N="43" REF="51">too often gains &s;trength as it &s;oftens, con|trary to the general effects of refinement, I am not to be told, that frequently the gene|ro&s;ity of one man, is the purcha&s;e of ingrati|tude in another; in&s;omuch that it might be well to do the kindne&s;s &s;olicited, and con&s;ider the neglect and ungrateful treatment there|upon, not as an inevitable, but probable con&s;equence:" Sir Armine &s;aw clearly this difference of con&s;truction without deploring it; he believed that all would live like good brothers, and turn out good men. They conver&s;ed much; agreed but little in opinion, yet &s;eldom altercated. "I dare &s;ay, all which we have read or been told," would Henry fre|quently &s;ay, "re&s;pecting the deceit of man, and of woman kind, is true; but my heart has no time to weigh its emotions, brother, in the &s;crupulous balance which is held by rea|&s;on. I do not &s;top to calculate chances. I hear a tale of di&s;tre&s;s. I &s;ee an object of ap|parent poverty; my hand is extended, and the relief admini&s;tered before I hardly know what I have done. I follow a tender emotion: nature has commanded, and I obey; but I do not rea&s;on upon it."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="52">"What does all this prove," would John reply, "but that we are both fools, brother? and have only a different way of committing the &s;ame folly. I with, you without thought? Here you have the advantage."</P>
<P>"Not at all," would Henry an&s;wer, "I wi&s;h the per&s;on benefited had been a better &s;ort of being; but his wants &s;eemed as immediate as extreme; yet if I had taken all the time which rea&s;onable and judgmatical gentlemen require to trace out character, and fortify my&s;elf by vouchers, the man mu&s;t have &s;tarved before I knew whether I could be ju&s;tified in preventing it."</P>
<P>"A truce, a truce!" interrupted James, who u&s;ually &s;ummed up the&s;e family conver&s;a|tions, when Sir Armine was not pre&s;ent&mdash; "Your hearts de&s;erve to be treated with more re&s;pect. Hypocri&s;y deducts from the plea&s;ure of the generous, it is true; but &s;hould never de&s;troy it. The &s;anctions of judgment and rea&s;on on our actions, are always to be wi&s;h|ed, but cannot always be obtained, without, at lea&s;t, an equal hazard of as much wrong as of right. Again&s;t the ca&s;ualties of bounty,
<PB N="45" REF="53">my brothers, no tender nature can be defend|ed. The appeal is made to a power which often arrives at maturity, before we know there is any thing of equal force in the world."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>ONE day when the &s;ame party were a&s;&s;embled, and the di&s;cour&s;e had taken a &s;imilar turn, John attacking human nature, Henry defending it, and James acting as a check on both, a poor man with every ap|pearance of the mo&s;t abject wretchedne&s;s; his limbs almo&s;t as tattered as the garments that covered them; a patch on his eye, and both his legs tucked under &s;tumps, a&s;&s;ailed their pity. "What's the odds now," &s;aid John, "that this is not a damn'd rogue? Here, fel|low, keep the tricks which you are preparing to play off upon us for the next traveller; and, for once, I will make it your intere&s;t to tell the truth," throwing &s;ixpence into his hat; "confe&s;s, are not you a &s;ad hypocrite? and were not you on the point of telling us a pack of pity-moving lies?" "Fie, brother!" &s;aid
<PB N="46" REF="54">James, "you have no right to in&s;ult, if you do not choo&s;e to relieve the man. His misfortune is &s;ufficiently obvious, however it may have been induced." Hereupon, the mendicant began the cant of his profe&s;&s;ion, which drew from Henry an additional &s;hilling. "Nay," &s;aid John, "there are very few of the be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed beggars have virtue enough to refu&s;e fal&s;|hood, when they are paid double for it." "Are there no &s;uch things then as principles?" &s;aid Henry:&mdash;"Not among&s;t beggars, in high or in low life," rejoined John. "There, fellow, as you cannot &s;erve God and Mammon, take your choice, a rogue or an hone&s;t man?&mdash;my &s;ixpence, or his &s;hilling"&mdash;"Lord, you're a merry gentleman. I like both, an't plea&s;e your honour, and God ble&s;s you!" "There, I told you &s;o," &s;aid John, "a damn'd rogue!"&mdash; Henry &s;miled. "The good man would offend neither of you; &s;o accepts the bounty of both," ob&s;erved James, joining their plea|&s;antry. "Well," an&s;wered John, "I need not &s;ay who is the rogue, but I know who are the fools." At this in&s;tant, a po&s;t-chai&s;e pa&s;&s;ing rapidly was met by another carriage, and over|&s;et,
<PB N="47" REF="55">the driver was thrown, and the hor&s;es were dragging the carriage. The three brothers a&s;&s;i&s;ted: the beggar in&s;tantly drew the patch from his eye, di&s;incumbered his legs, tucked the &s;tumps under his arm, and pa&s;&s;ed them. The accident happening within a &s;hort di&s;|tance from the family man&s;ion, James pro|po&s;ed &s;ending for Sir Armine's carriage.&mdash; "What occa&s;ion for carriages?" cried the beg|gar, catching the lady in his arms, and run|ning off with her, "I warrant the gentleman, who don't &s;eem much hurt, will follow." The three brothers entered the apartment ju&s;t as the beggar, having procured every accommodation the ca&s;tle afforded, &s;et off for the village apothecary with incredible &s;peed. He returned with &s;ome hart&s;horn. "There, an plea&s;e your lady&s;hip, that will bring you about&mdash;pure &s;trong&mdash;has taken away my breath, and, I hope, it will bring back yours."</P>
<P>The lady was now recovering apace. The gentleman had received little injury. Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton were from home. The apothecary followed his hart&s;|horn; the cure was &s;oon perform'd; for the
<PB N="48" REF="56">mi&s;chief con&s;i&s;ted rather in alarm than injury, and the travellers pur&s;ued their journey. The tumult of circum&s;tances now &s;ub&s;iding, the brothers had lei&s;ure to advert to the meta|morpho&s;is of the beggar. "Well!" &s;aid John to Henry, "and who is in the right now? a rogue or no rogue? why, what's become of your timber Mr. Beggar?"&mdash;"The Lord knows," replied the beggar, archly: "I hope, gentle|men, you have not left my legs behind you." "To be &s;ure," &s;aid James, "they mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as part of the accident." "O, he can do very well without them, I &s;ee," &s;aid John. "I beg your pardon there," an&s;wer'd the beggar, "I &s;hould &s;tarve without them: I u&s;e the&s;e things," pointing to his natural legs, "only upon extraordinary occa&s;ions: but my timber is my &s;taple commodity&mdash;well, God &s;ave your honours&mdash;I mu&s;t go look after my &s;upport." The facetious mendicant was bowing out, leaving his company not a little amus'd and delighted with him, when John caught his hand&mdash;"You are a fine fellow! and yet you mu&s;t be a rogue too! or el&s;e tho&s;e legs would have carried you into a much more reputable bu&s;ine&s;s." The beggar &s;hook his head!&mdash;
<PB N="49" REF="57">"However," continued John, "if all the ex|traordinary occa&s;ions upon which you u&s;e them are like the pre&s;ent, 'tis pity you &s;hould ever again tuck them behind you. So here's &s;omething to keep them in repair," giving him a crown-piece&mdash;"and here's a trifle," added Henry, pouring out the contents of his pur&s;e, "to buy you a new pair."&mdash;"Now that's an encouragement to the &s;coundrel part of him," &s;aid John! "I think, indeed," &s;aid James, "half a crown a piece would have been a more ju&s;t divi&s;ion." "All, an' plea&s;e your honour," replied the man, "its very well as it is: but for that matter, I would not take a dozen pur&s;es for my &s;tumps, and yet I'm no &s;coundrel neither; Ah! gentlefolks, if you knew but their hi&s;|tory!&mdash; but that's no matter," added he, fetching a deep &s;igh. Tears gu&s;h'd to his eyes, and he turn'd away his face. "Poor fellow," &s;aid Mr. Burton, "you have made a mi&s;take; here is Sixpence coming to you out of your &s;hilling." "I forgot that, ma&s;ter," an&s;wer'd the beggar; "however, I'll take the te&s;ter." "I hope," whi&s;per'd James to John, "you will allow, though it was only in the
<PB N="50" REF="58">divi&s;ion of a &s;hilling, that this action of our Apothecary tells to his hone&s;ty, when you remember that, his large family and &s;lender means of &s;upporting it, make every &s;ixpence a matter of con&s;equence." "Say you &s;o," cried the mendicant. "The heart beneath the&s;e many-colour'd rags," cried Henry, "would give dignity to ermine." "Who would be the lo&s;er then," &s;aid the beggar? "A noble fellow," exclaim'd John, "in &s;pite of his &s;tumps." Henry &s;hook him heartily by the hand, in doing which, one of the tatters of our beggar's coat of patches, got entangled in one of Henry's wrought buttons, and, as is generally the ca&s;e, when the weak and poor come into contact with the &s;trong and &s;plendid, fell to the ground. Henry expre&s;&s;ed regret. "Ble&s;s your honour, no con&s;equence, only I mu&s;t not lo&s;e it:&mdash; 'Tis a little bit of my property," &s;aid the beg|gar, &s;tooping to pick up the remnant. "Thou &s;halt have a new &s;uit," &s;aid Henry. "Your honour's all goodne&s;s, but that would be my ruin. Every rag about me, is, at a moderate computation, worth a guinea: but, as I have a
<PB N="51" REF="59">poor bedridden father, who has no objection to having a good coat upon his back: and as your honour's bounty has enabled me to give him one, his &s;on &s;hall ble&s;s you with his la&s;t breath, although, he &s;hould live to wear out a whole fore&s;t in &s;tumps." Sir Armine. here, took the beggar a moment a&s;ide; after which, the latter &s;miled merrily on the com|pany, and &s;eeing the apothecary making his bows to the family, exclaim'd, "And now if you plea&s;e Ma&s;ter Doctor, I will purcha&s;e a few things for poor father in your way." They went out together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>ARRIVING at the &s;hop, for the adven|ture would not be complete were we not to tell you what happen'd there; our mendicant, who had luckily found the &s;tumps, perceived the apothecary in waiting, &s;urrounded by his family.</P>
<P>Henry's whi&s;per re&s;pecting the worth and poverty of poor Burton was &s;till in his memory: and while he was in &s;earch of the
<PB N="52" REF="60">&s;tumps, he argued,&mdash;"Here now is a man who <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be hone&s;t, or el&s;e he never would have thought of returning my &s;ixpence: and he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be poor, for the honourable gentleman that gave me the pur&s;e &s;aid &s;o in a whi&s;per. He mu&s;t not dig, and I may: he is a&s;ham'd to beg, and I am not: he is a father, and has perhaps a dozen mouths to feed three times a day, and I have but two,&mdash;dad's and my own: Yes, yes, I &s;ee plainly, the &s;ame good fortune that turn'd the carriage over for me, had a hand in turning me over to him,&mdash;One good turn de&s;erves another."</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning brought him almo&s;t to the thre&s;hold of the apothecary's &s;hop; where, after paying his re&s;pects, as they are com|monly paid by tho&s;e who expect to receive favours, and as rarely by tho&s;e who intend to be&s;tow them; he made out a li&s;t of what he did&mdash;<HI>not</HI> want: that he might hand&s;omely furni&s;h the vender with a little of what he <HI>did</HI> want; for, notwith&s;tanding his &s;tumps, our mendicant had as little to do with phy&s;ic as mo&s;t men, and was not indeed much ac|quainted even with the names of more than
<PB N="53" REF="61">half a dozen out of the million of poi&s;ons and antidotes di&s;covered by the art of man, to prolong or to cut &s;hort the mi&s;erable little life of that melancholy, merry little wretch, who, though at the top of the creation, &s;eems to have more difficulty of getting into the world, to have more wants after he has got in it, and to have more ways of being &s;ent out of it, than all the other little or great wretches of that creation. Such drugs, how|ever, as he could recollect, and in &s;uch pro|portions as he found, upon enquiry, would amount to the quantum of ca&s;h he had pre|determined to dive&s;t him&s;elf of, he bought: put them into his pocket, as carefully as if the life of a friend depended upon their ope|ration; then facetiou&s;ly entering into a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e with the apothecary's wife, dancing the &s;mall children on his knee; and as to the larger ones, if he found any &s;weet-hearts at the &s;air, or any where el&s;e in his hops, worth &s;ending, they &s;hould hear from him again.</P>

<P>IN relief of their &s;erious &s;tudies came in the intellectual amu&s;ements of the three brothers. The juvenile mu&s;e of the younger, by her light and playful &s;allies, plea&s;antly contra&s;ted and agreeably &s;et off the more &s;olid, not to &s;ay &s;olemn meditations of John; thence, indeed, and from an early &s;orrow, the &s;ports of the latter took an aweful turn. he read the poets as a relaxation from the philo&s;ophers, yet he read them not as an enthu&s;ia&s;t, but as a critic; and therefore detected more faults than beauties. Henry, on the other hand, with all the ardour of poetic pa&s;&s;ion, read, as he wrote, to be delighted, and &s;o found more beauties than faults; he was too much in love with the mu&s;e to look &s;everely for, or at, her little incon&s;i&s;tencies, and, as is the ca&s;e with all lovers, was too &s;incerely &s;mit with the charms of his object to be angry at her foibles.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;imilitude in their opinions, how|ever, was a fre&s;h &s;ource of amicable con|tention.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63">Henry, had been reading to his father &s;ome pieces of poetry, and had made liberal reflexions, mix'd with expre&s;&s;ions of admira|tion on various pa&s;&s;ages.&mdash;At a pau&s;e in the compo&s;ition, John was referred to for the &s;uffrage of his opinion.&mdash;"You are &s;ilent brother," cried Henry&mdash;"yes&mdash;now for a libel on the lyre."</P>
<P>"Far be it from me," return'd John, "to treat any lady, mortal or immortal, with di&s;|re&s;pect, but really, Henry, the godde&s;s of your idolatry is &s;o very uncertain and capricious a deity, that even you, who are one of her warme&s;t votaries, mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he is in no wi&s;e to be depended on, either for in&s;piration or happine&s;s.&mdash;She has been known, indeed, to leave her &s;uppliant in the mid&s;t of his &s;ighs and groans."&mdash;"Avaunt the &s;lander of &s;uch cavil!" exclaim'd Henry.&mdash;"Away with the common-place detraction of &s;uch as never knew the &s;oul-chearing influence of the power they condemn! Never was the Mu&s;e faithle&s;s to tho&s;e &s;he loved. Even I, my brother, the lea&s;t favor'd perhaps of her votaries," con|tinued our young enthu&s;iaft, "yet &s;incerely

Ah they do not know with what a force &s;he acts, what an ardour &s;he kindles, what a &s;oftne&s;s &s;he diffu&s;es, what an energy &s;he in&s;pires!"</P>
<P>"Very &s;ine, brother! but were you to be the denizen of all the nine, and the &s;elected &s;avourite of their in&s;piring god, I am &s;till of opinion, poetry mu&s;t yield the palm to philo&s;ophy. The fir&s;t is as the flame of the meteor, that glares and pa&s;&s;es by&mdash;while we admire, we tremble. Not &s;uch the &s;teady rays that dart into the &s;oul from &s;acred philo&s;o|phy! at once bright and la&s;ting; animating as the &s;un&mdash;powerful as"&mdash;"And what," que&s;tioned the eager Henry, "has this proud Philo&s;ophy, that the Mu&s;e is not more nobly gifted with? Does the vaunted pre-eminence
<PB N="57" REF="65">con&s;i&s;t in be&s;towing more fortitude in mental, or more patience in corporeal angui&s;h?&mdash; Does it better defend the bo&s;om from wrongs, or pour a more &s;alutary balm upon its wounds? Ah, my cold brother! yes, let me repeat, had you but for a moment, felt the genuine magic of the lyre, had nature per|mitted you to experience the rapturous &s;en&s;a|tions which &s;well the heart, when fancy paints her <HI>vi&s;ionary</HI> favourite, or its &s;tronger throbs, when poetic truth,&mdash;truth adorn'd by the mu&s;e, draws her <HI>real</HI> hero; had you ever been con&s;cious of the enviable &s;igh, which heaves from the brea&s;t, the delicious tear which gu&s;hes from the eye of genius, when innocence is to be protected, guilt confronted, and benevolence or pity pourtrayed&mdash;or had you ever been &s;en&s;ible to the mu&s;e's power, to &s;oothe the thou&s;and ills, to which, alas! her votaries are heir: to charm away their &s;en&s;e of cruel injuries, till injury it&s;elf is forgot, and the aggre&s;&s;or as often forgiven, you would confe&s;s that the immortal wreath is not a&s;&s;igned to her without a cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"Her tears and &s;ighs I am di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="58" REF="66">allow her," an&s;wer'd John, "they are part of the heavenly dame's paraphernalia; but what if Philo&s;ophy &s;hould, upon a more manly and &s;ober principle, puni&s;h vice and protect virtue, pardon offences and pity offenders, without all this mourning and wailing? No, no, philo&s;ophy and pro&s;e for me!" "And for me," retorted Henry, "no apathy either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e. The one de&s;troys, and the other pre&s;erves; the one raves, and the other rea&s;ons."</P>
<P>All this time, James had &s;eated him&s;elf quietly in the middle of the room, employed with his pencil; every now and then taking his eye from the drawing-paper to the di&s;pu|tants, and then calmly proceeding in his work. "Was ever anything &s;o provoking?" exclaim'd Olivia, "only &s;ee if that immova|ble James is not coolly engaged in"&mdash; "What?" interpo&s;ed Henry eagerly, look|ing over the paper, which James as earne&s;tly concealed. "Nay," &s;aid the latter, "that is not &s;air; I did not interrupt you or John in your amu&s;ements: why &s;hould you di&s;turb me in the enjoyment of mine? Not that I
<PB N="59" REF="67">have any &s;erious objection either to &s;hare with you what has given me plea&s;ure, even though I could derive no &s;atisfaction from yours. And yet, &s;trictly &s;peaking, mine has ari&s;en out of yours: but indeed, I have but ju&s;t begun my &s;ketch."</P>
<P>James di&s;cover'd his drawing, which he had entitled, "Moral Geography." It repre|&s;ented three ve&s;&s;els of different &s;ize and figure, the one, a plea&s;ure barge, lightly and elegantly con&s;tructed, the colours di&s;|played, the top-gallant &s;ails &s;et, and bound|ing over the billows with incredible &s;wift|ne&s;s. The &s;econd, was a line of battle &s;hip of maje&s;tic port, proudly buffeting a &s;tormy &s;ea, and &s;eeming indignant of the oppo&s;ing winds, &s;he held her determined cour&s;e. The third, was a ve&s;&s;el of burthen, a &s;low &s;ailor, very little ornamented, yet &s;trongly and u&s;e|fully built: all were de&s;tined for the &s;ame port, all &s;tarted nearly at the &s;ame time, the fir&s;t two were placed very forward as having got a-head of the other, but braving the tempe&s;t and ra&s;hly confident in them&s;elves, they were exhibited in another part of the draw|ing,
<PB N="60" REF="68">pre&s;enting &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, firing guns, the one &s;truck again&s;t the rocks of Scilly, the other again&s;t Charybdis, mean|while, the third ve&s;&s;el, too humble to contend with hurricanes, and not pre&s;umptuous enough to hazard extremes, laid to, till the &s;torm was over, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;afely, though unambitiou&s;ly, between. "Your rocks and quick&s;ands, upon paper, James, prove nothing&mdash;Ah! how do I wi&s;h my deare&s;t father," &s;aid Henry, after giving the matter a little re&s;t, "that you would deign to &s;ettle our ever-jarring opinions on this &s;ubject. Yours have, indeed, been already favourable, but John, I perceive, wants con&s;tant repe|titions of high authority to make him think well of any art but his own." "I admit what you have related, brother, to be poetry," replied John, "and &s;ome of its fire has reached me, but there is no degree of autho|rity can make me an <HI>advocate</HI> for palpable ab&s;urdity, whether in life or literature, in ver&s;e or in pro&s;e, though the undue exerci&s;e of &s;uch authority, which I can never have to fear from our father, might make me &s;ilent."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="69">John bowed re&s;pectfully to Sir Armine, who took his hand cordially, and &s;miled kindly on Henry. "You mu&s;t not, my Harry," &s;aid the impartial James, "&s;uffer your name to be catalogued among&s;t the irritable race; nor mu&s;t you, my dear John, be ranked among&s;t the &s;narlers of the day. From true critici&s;m, a poet &s;hould not &s;hrink; and fal&s;e, can ultimately do him no harm. Let John's cen&s;ure, therefore, rather animate Henry to triumph over what may be hyper|critical, and to remove from his compo&s;ition what may be really objectionable." "In the days of youth," &s;aid Sir Armine,&mdash;"they are commonly days of intrepidity, I was my&s;elf, you mu&s;t know, hardy enough to write&mdash;yea, and to write a romance."</P>
<P>"A romance, Sir!" que&s;tioned John? "Verily, a romance," an&s;wered his father. "Where is it, Sir, what is its name? I never heard you mention it before," ob&s;erved Henry, earne&s;tly. "I can ea&s;ily conceive the rea&s;on of that," cried John &s;ignificantly. "You think," &s;aid Sir Armine, "I was a&s;hamed of having mi&s;employed my time."
<PB N="62" REF="70">"The wi&s;e&s;t youth hath its indi&s;cretions, Sir," ob&s;erved John, re&s;pectfully. "Had it been a treati&s;e on Philo&s;ophy, it would not have been thought indi&s;creet, I dare &s;ay," cried Henry tartly, looking at John, "and I have not a doubt, but my dear father had every rea&s;on to be proud of it," continued Henry. "In truth, neither proud nor a&s;hamed," replied his father. "You &s;hall hear; when I had written my romance&mdash;it really was a romance, John; there is no denying it; I felt curio&s;ity to collect the private &s;entiments of acquaintance upon my labours."&mdash;"La|bours, Sir!" interrupted John, drily. "Yes, labours, &s;on John; there may be &s;erious labour in giving the ea&s;e of nature to every work of art. In ca&s;e the general &s;en&s;e of a private circle had been again&s;t me, prudence, I had hope, might prevail with vanity." John &s;hook his head, "to take warning from the '&s;till &s;mall voice,' of limited di&s;approbation, without provoking the clamour of public cen&s;ure."</P>
<P>Henry li&s;tened eagerly: John hemm'd twice. "At the time this idea &s;truck me, I had re&s;ided
<PB N="63" REF="71">in London many years, and mixing freely, as well with the gay, as grave a&s;&s;ociations of that wonder-working Metropolis, I could be at no lo&s;s for people, who, from enmity, if not friend&s;hip, might be inclined to give me the whole&s;ome &s;everity of truth."</P>
<P>"Had my father then, at any time, an ene|my?" que&s;tioned Henry, affectionately. "I hope &s;o:" an&s;wered John, bluntly. "It would be one proof of his wanting many noble qualities, which I am proud to know he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, if he had not no fervid friend without a bitter enemy. Cold friends, cold enemies, fervid enemies, warm friends," &s;ays a pro|found thinker, "God make me worthy enough of a friend to create a foe." James extended a hand to each of his brothers. "But London," continued the venerable Fitz|orton, "was a &s;cene too indi&s;criminate, too de&s;ultory, and too mighty for &s;uch an expe|riment. It blew hard, and the fro&s;ts of No|vember chilled the day, as this &s;ugge&s;tion ro&s;e to my mind. The long evenings are at hand! I will begin to try my book in the country. The idea animated.&mdash;A &s;ocial

In the winter, too! When people are thrown upon the tricks of a kitten for amu&s;ement! And as to critici&s;m, every body is, naturally, more or le&s;s, a cri|tic, in whatever re&s;pects the emotions and pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, and the joy or &s;orrow of human life. Nay, every family is a little <HI>world</HI> of critics.</P>
<P>"Brother James," cried Henry, "how can you be reading that abominable Wood's In|&s;titutes, at a time like this, when my deare&s;t father is ju&s;t beginning to read his novel?"</P>
<P>"In the progre&s;s of reading," continued Sir Armine, "I experienced all that can be exhibited of human variety, in human opi|nions.
<PB N="65" REF="73">The favourite pa&s;&s;age or character of one hearer, became the furious objection of another: &s;ome approved only of the <HI>pathos,</HI> others yawned and nodded in the mid&s;t of it. The&s;e, again, were awaked by a laugh, which threw my pathetical admirers into the va|pours. Some objected to the length, &s;ome to the brevity: tra&s;h, trumpery, &s;tuff, non|&s;en&s;e! obligingly echoed one of the party.&mdash; Delightuful, charming! incomparable! re|&s;ounded another fair auditor.</P>
<P>"And pray, Sir," que&s;tioned Henry, &s;igh|ing, "what in this perplexing counter-action of judgment, did you do?" "I con&s;idered, that if a compo&s;ition de&s;erved to travel down the &s;tream of time, unju&s;t critici&s;m would not long ob&s;truct its cour&s;e. That which is im|peri&s;hable in its own nature, &s;hall a&s;&s;ert its immortality among&s;t things immortal; nor can any degree of elaborate panegyric re|&s;tore to life what oblivion has &s;wept away, at the command of rea&s;on and truth."</P>
<P>"Ah! I feel the &s;acred truths, Sir," cried Henry; "but, methinks, I &s;hould have lo&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="74">all confidence in my&s;elf, and dropt the trem|bling pen."</P>
<P>"I would have held mine the fa&s;ter, or mended it," rejoined John, "if I found it worth the pains; if not, I would have thrown it away, and taken up a more u&s;eful in&s;trument."</P>
<P>"Alas! I fear, I &s;hould have renounced the pre&s;s at once," &s;aid Henry. "No doubt," retorted John, "there are cowards enough in the world; and their fine timidity may, for aught I know, be a mark of genius; but give me the &s;oul rough, determined, and if you will, inelegant, which, like the mountain pine, however it may for a moment bend to the bla&s;t, ri&s;es again as often as it is a&s;&s;ailed. I am for proud ela&s;tick re&s;i&s;tance, and have &s;carce yet ever &s;een, heard, or read any thing that a man, or woman either, ought not to be a&s;hamed of, come of the <HI>yielding</HI> quali|ties; and as to critics, a writer &s;hould no more be di&s;plea&s;ed, or di&s;couraged, by hav|ing his faults corrected, or pointed out, than he &s;hould quarrel with a guide, for &s;hewing him a pitfall, or taking him out, when ra&s;h|ne&s;s or ignorance had led him into it."</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="75">"But I remember," continued Sir Armine, "my great difficulty was about a Preface. I wi&s;hed, extremely, to affix &s;ome explanatory matter; but had &s;een &s;o many in&s;tances where the preliminary pages were pa&s;&s;ed over, that I was alarmed le&s;t mine &s;hould &s;uffer a like neglect, and thereby lo&s;e the opportunity of illu&s;trating therein the points I intended chief|ly to impre&s;s: for I felt &s;candalized at the thought of having it &s;uppo&s;ed, I had written a book to tell a long &s;tory, which was dignified neither by its plan nor execution:" "As to prefaces," &s;aid John, archly, "I would be a match for any body, in that particular. If the modern reader runs away from wi&s;dom in the u&s;ual form, a form which gave our forefathers &s;atisfaction, &s;ome extraordinary means mu&s;t be devi&s;ed, to beguile him. The appetite, which is di&s;ea&s;ed by heating and improper aliments, calls aloud for medicines to prevent a corruption of the whole ma&s;s; but if the &s;ickly patient rejects the phy&s;ic, which he ought to take, in &s;ub&s;tance, its &s;alu|tary bitters mu&s;t be adulterated in &s;yrups."</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="76">"In other words," cried Henry, "you would &s;trew flowers over the formidable paths of &s;cience; and that is ju&s;t coming round to my point. I thank you, brother."</P>
<P>"I would tie together, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o," &s;aid John, "a &s;olid &s;heaf of wheat, which invigorates the heart, and a florid, &s;weet &s;melling, but &s;ickly weed, that only tickles the no&s;e."</P>

<P>THE conver&s;ations on the&s;e and other &s;ubjects, however, were not confined to them|&s;elves. There had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the fami|lies of Clare and Fitzorton a long cour&s;e of good offices, from a principle of amity, which had de&s;cended, pure and unabated, from father to &s;on, for upwards of a century; during all which time, the tradition of their hou&s;es had not recorded one difference, &s;ocial, political, or religious; but, on the contrary, tho&s;e tra|ditions di&s;played innumerable te&s;timonies of the affection which knit them together: their
<PB N="69" REF="77">parks joined each other; and the avenues of venerable oak, which led from one hou&s;e to the other, opened on the view the &s;eats of their mutual ho&s;pitality, and interchanged endearment.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare, the proprietor of the manor|hou&s;e, did not tarni&s;h the virtues, nor mi&s;|apply the fortunes, which had de&s;cended to him. He had lo&s;t his lady only a few months after their union, of which the &s;ole fruit was a living con&s;olation, blooming in his only child.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Mr. Clare's daughter, as it &s;eems to be a &s;ettled convention betwixt romance writers and their readers, that the ca&s;ket &s;hould be &s;uited to the gem, the reader's fancy has, no doubt, already con|vened the loves and graces to meet and contribute each their &s;hare of appropriate attraction. Now it did actually happen in life, and &s;hall, therefore, be recorded in this hi&s;tory, that the per&s;on of Olivia Clare was not unworthy of the mind, by which it was illumined.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="78">Per&s;onal beauty, it has been &s;aid, falls under one or other of the&s;e four heads&mdash; Colour, form, expre&s;&s;ion, grace; the two former of which have been con&s;idered as the body; the two latter as the &s;oul of beauty. The young lady, under our pencil, had all the&s;e in very intere&s;ting proportions. Her complexion was of that bright brown, which the critics, on beauty, have determined gives lu&s;tre to all other colours, a peculiar vivacity to the eyes, and to the whole look a richne&s;s, which is in vain &s;ought for in the white&s;t and mo&s;t tran&s;parent &s;kins. The radiance of thriving health &s;hone forth upon every fea|ture, and from her eyes beamed that gli&s;tening fire, which is only vi&s;ible in the morning of life.</P>
<P>Her di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o artle&s;s, &s;he would have been an ea&s;y prey to the in&s;idious, had &s;he fallen among&s;t the wicked, in&s;tead of the good. Such was her innocency, that it was as difficult for her to &s;u&s;pect an ill in the heart of another, as to conceive any in her own; without the &s;urfeiting fu&s;s of female &s;entimentality, or the &s;ickning affec|tation
<PB N="71" REF="79">of novel-born benevolence, &s;he was generous, confidential, &s;imple, and &s;incere.</P>
<P>A happy grace of nature to give to every thing its kinde&s;t con&s;truction, was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed upon every lineament of Olivia's face, that had her countenance, or figure, wanted every other attraction, this alone mu&s;t have rendered her an object of e&s;teem and admiration. So victorious, indeed, over all events, and oc|currences, was this unpretending, but <HI>all|&s;ubduing,</HI> charm, that it was an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of con&s;olation to her&s;elf and others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE preference &s;hown by this young lady to Henry Fitzorton, though &s;he tenderly loved the whole family, began to &s;how it&s;elf before &s;he was con&s;cious of any nice di&s;tinc|tion in her own &s;en&s;ations. If &s;he pre&s;ented flowers, which u&s;ed to be the offering of al|mo&s;t every day, in&s;omuch that a bouquet with the dew upon it graced the &s;ide of every cup upon the breakfa&s;t table, <HI>that</HI> de&s;igned for Henry was always arranged with the mo&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="80">care, and con&s;i&s;ted of a more beautiful a&s;&s;em|blage; nor did &s;he forget to blend in it a &s;prig of laurel, or myrtle, to adorn her little poet. She would u&s;ually choo&s;e him as her companion in a walk, and expre&s;s &s;ome little di&s;plea&s;ure, and mortification, if &s;he was not his choice in the dance.</P>
<P>At later periods &s;he would leave John to his philo&s;ophical, and James to his legal, &s;tudies, and wandering with Henry among&s;t the woods, or meadows, di&s;cour&s;e on the witching &s;ubject of his mu&s;e; not that &s;he was her&s;elf a votary, but that &s;he loved what mo&s;t intere&s;ted Henry Fitzorton. She was never &s;o happy as when he permitted her to make tran&s;cripts of his ver&s;es, get them by heart, and recite them at the Fitzorton fire &s;ide; &s;he would almo&s;t embrace tho&s;e who appeared touched with their merits, and di&s;|cover the mo&s;t pointed chagrin if they fell &s;hort of making a &s;uitable impre&s;&s;ion; and once upon John's &s;aying they were hardly good enough for the bellman at Chri&s;tmas, but might do well enough for a girl's thread-paper,
<PB N="73" REF="81">&s;he bur&s;t with tears, and did not &s;peak to him for almo&s;t an hour after.</P>
<P>Indeed John often a&s;&s;umed the critic in his judgment of Henry's poetry, and Henry in turn threw a dart, not without effect, at John's philo&s;ophy. Olivia always &s;ided with the former. Sir Armine &s;ummed up; Mr. Clare &s;moaked his pipe, &s;ent forth a &s;hrewd ob&s;er|vation between the whiffs, &s;ometimes ani|mated the combatants, &s;ometimes arbitrated. James, ju&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, and candid, tried to keep the youthful di&s;putants within bounds. Lady Fitzorton always gave the &s;trength of her remarks to the weak; but Mr. Clare, from a gleeful di&s;po&s;ition, would now and then &s;pirit up the &s;trife, a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t under an arch pretence of ending the debate; his real de&s;ign, however, was always tra|ver&s;ed by Olivia, who, when Henry appeared to have the wor&s;t of it, would, when other arguments failed, bribe the old gentleman over with a ki&s;s. Many were their literary contentions, &s;erious and &s;portive; &s;uch of the&s;e as more immediately connected with their re|lative &s;ituations as &s;ons and brothers, their
<PB N="74" REF="82">pa&s;&s;ions as friends or lovers, and their characters as men, will occa&s;ionally be introduced.</P>
<P>As time &s;tole on, the brothers grew into men. The attachment of Olivia Clare to the younge&s;t Fitzorton, was of a more intere&s;ting, and deci&s;ive kind; her tenderne&s;s a&s;&s;umed a more affecting form: it had gained more <HI>power,</HI> but produced le&s;s <HI>happine&s;s;</HI> it had lo&s;t nothing of its innocence, but much of that gaiety and &s;port by which it was before cha|racteri&s;ed. If <HI>then</HI> it was a ro&s;e-bud in her bo&s;om, it was <HI>now</HI> the &s;ame flower, more blown, more fragrant, perhaps, but &s;ur|rounded by its thorns, who&s;e puncture the heart wherein it grew and flouri&s;hed, began &s;en&s;ibly to feel. She was re&s;tle&s;s when apart from Henry, and yet troubled in his pre|&s;ence; &s;he caught, imperceptibly, all his ideas of delight and &s;orrow; and their very genius &s;eemed by more than in&s;tinct, more than habit, to a&s;&s;imilate. The moon-beam, the mu&s;e, the nightingale, the &s;oft &s;ea&s;on of the twilight, the lap&s;e of the &s;tream, the &s;igh of the zephyr, the turbulence of the &s;torm, and the roar of the cataract, had long been
<PB N="75" REF="83">his, and, at length, became her objects of enthu&s;ia&s;m. But whenever the&s;e &s;ombrous charms gave way to brighter images their reflected lu&s;tre would irradiate Olivia. The fathers &s;aw what they pre&s;umed was a &s;ym|pathy in both. They nouri&s;hed and looked forward to it as the only bond that could po&s;|&s;ibly add &s;trength and beauty to a friend&s;hip, that had been the growth of more than half a century.</P>
<P>Henry, however, who had all this time borne only the affection of a tender brother to his lovely a&s;&s;ociate, was no &s;ooner informed of the nature of <HI>her</HI> affection, and of the family <HI>views</HI> thereupon, than he remitted his &s;tudies for the clerical office, and cheri&s;hed more than his wonted melancholy. The family views, however, not being yet declared formally, he collected the &s;enfe of them from certain ca&s;ual hints, and &s;portive in&s;inuations. Sir Armine would often &s;ay, in the hearing of Henry, when Olivia was mi&s;&s;ing, "Where is the Poete&s;s? Corydon, what have you done with your Phillis?" and if Henry was ab&s;ent nothing was more
<PB N="76" REF="84">common than for one or other of the families, turning to Olivia to exclain, "Ble&s;s me! where is your intended?" They always were &s;eated &s;ide by &s;ide at table, and if the one or the other were out of the way, the place was held &s;acred, and, excepting a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, unoccupied. John, indeed, would, now and then, u&s;urp the chair, but a grave look from Olivia, would make him re&s;ign it.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, indeed, was, by long habit, become &s;o familiar, that the names of Henry and Olivia, were always mentioned together; and however involved any other parts of the family might be in the que&s;tion then before them, it never happened that Olivia and John, or Olivia and James, were united, but Olivia and Henry, were &s;ure to come together; nay, they &s;eemed in that order to be &s;o properly placed, that it was difficult to tran&s;po&s;e or mix them with any other, even when it was really nece&s;&s;ary. John would exert, occa&s;ionally, his confu&s;ing talents and thereby derange the plan for &s;eve|ral minutes, coupling his own name with Olivia's, and joining together tho&s;e of Henry
<PB N="77" REF="85">and his mu&s;e, declaring, that <HI>&s;he</HI> only was the proper mi&s;tre&s;s of a poet; but the&s;e perplexi|ties produced more plea&s;antry than vexation, and always ended by John's giving up the point.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT, however, which more &s;trongly marked the intention of both hou&s;es was Henry's di&s;covery of the motive with which he and Olivia were left together; and not &s;eldom &s;uch excu&s;es of ab&s;ence made by the re&s;t of the families as plainly indicated that Henry and Olivia, were to be con&s;idered by every body as <HI>lovers;</HI> and, indeed, had any &s;tronger proofs ben wanting, the behaviour of Olivia, on the&s;e occa&s;ion, when every word, look, and accent, betrayed her, would have been fully &s;ufficient. She imputed the &s;udden, and unu&s;ual, re&s;erve of Henry to the &s;ame motives that produced her own&mdash;an increa&s;e of that timidity which ari&s;es from the increa&s;e of innocent and con&s;cious love; and though no two emotions in nature could be more di&s;|tinct than tho&s;e, which at that time governed
<PB N="78" REF="86">their hearts, they produced, at the moment, a re&s;emblance &s;o accurate that any ob&s;erver might have mi&s;take the one for the other. Fearful to offend, and alive to all the merits and graces of Olivia, convinced that her con|duct, &s;ince he began to ob&s;erve upon it, mu&s;t, in a thou&s;and little in&s;tances, have ari&s;en from affection; grateful for the virtuous hap|pine&s;s his youth had received from the &s;ociety of one whom his heart had long &s;ince adopted as a &s;i&s;ter, and honoured by a &s;entiment which he could not return, and which threatened to break in upon the felicity of both; Henry could not per&s;uade him&s;elf to an alteration of conduct, without, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, account|ing for it; and to do this would not only be the mo&s;t formidable undertaking, in as much as it might affect Olivia, but as it would vio|late a &s;olemn vow by which he had pledged him&s;elf for a certain &s;ea&s;on, and which for e&s;pecial rea&s;ons did not admit even of frater|nal confidence; all, therefore, which could be done, in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs, was to recede, imperceptibly as it were, from the degree of attention, which he had formerly
<PB N="79" REF="87">&s;hewn this lovely creature; and as he could not bear treating her with the &s;emblance of unkindne&s;s, or of openly re&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e op|portunities which were &s;o purpo&s;ely thrown in his way, he had recour&s;e to other means; namely, to withdraw him&s;elf as often as he could from her &s;ociety. The abhorrence in which Sir Armine held public education did not afford the u&s;ual &s;eparations of &s;chools and univer&s;ities; he was him&s;elf in all part of knowledge and &s;cience the in&s;tructor of his children, who had, indeed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other &s;o much in cla&s;&s;ical and polite learning, and were &s;o in&s;eparable, that the ab&s;ence of a few days at this period of their lives, the only one, indeed, in which they were much toge|ther, was extremely unu&s;ual. For &s;ome time, therefore, he could pro&s;ecute his intention no otherwi&s;e than by tho&s;e pious frauds which the &s;ituation allowed.&mdash;Was any party of plea&s;ure propo&s;ed? Henry was &s;eized, on the &s;udden, with &s;o violent an head-ach, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to join them. Did the gentle Olivia offer <HI>her</HI> &s;ervices in the character of his nur&s;e? "She was all goodne&s;s, but he
<PB N="80" REF="88">could not endure company?" Was a fre&s;h plan &s;tarted upon his recovery? he feared adven|turing too &s;oon into the air might bring back his complaint. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the &s;turdy John always maintained "that the &s;ociety which was to be got by begging made the per&s;on invited appear too rich, and the beggar too poor; and that as he &s;hould always con&s;ider the company of another a fair exchange for his own, and no more, whether the &s;poiled child (&s;o he &s;ometimes called Henry) went abroad or &s;taid at home, was, in his opinion, perfectly immaterial: at any rate <HI>he</HI> &s;hould not conde&s;cend to turn <HI>coaxer:"</HI> at this Henry would &s;hake his head; and Olivia thank her &s;tars Henry was a poet not a philo&s;opher! Was Henry at any time tenderly urged by <HI>all</HI> the re&s;t of the family in con&s;piracy again&s;t him; and did a parent's &s;oft authority con|troul him? the language of refu&s;al was ever the harde&s;t to Henry's heart; he obeyed, but was always compelled to return the wor&s;e for it: the tears would gu&s;h from his eyes in the mid&s;t of the general hilarity; and the tender terrors of Olivia, her killing a&s;&s;iduities, and
<PB N="81" REF="89">her unbounded affection, &s;oon convinced him that &s;tratagems of this kind could no longer avail.</P>
<P>Henry now meditated &s;ome excur&s;ions re|mote from home, and e&s;pecially to &s;uch of his young friends as he knew were acquainted with no other parts of the family. He had cheered his &s;pirits, in the idea that this pro|ject would be more au&s;picious than the re&s;t. He took, therefore, the fir&s;t opportunity when his own family were a&s;&s;embled, and Olivia at the other hou&s;e, to mention the probable good that might be produced by change of air, naming the per&s;on he intended to vi&s;it. But in the very in&s;tant that Sir Armine nodded, as if acceding to the propo&s;al, Lady Fitzorton, in the mo&s;t unequivocal manner objected, as the very wor&s;t mea&s;ure he could adopt; "For, be&s;ides," &s;aid &s;he, "that the pre&s;ent unfavourable weather, my dear Harry, makes it madne&s;s for an invalid to go abroad; the hou&s;e you would mention has not, I be|lieve, had a well-aired bed in it the&s;e ten years. I therefore mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, as you value my life"&mdash;At this in&s;tant Olivia came in. "Yes,
<PB N="72" REF="90">I mu&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t Henry, that you do not hazard our lives, by ri&s;king your own." The cheeks of Olivia, which were before tinted with the bloom of exerci&s;e, by a little excur|&s;ion &s;he had taken from the ca&s;tle to the ma|nor-hou&s;e, became pale as death&mdash;"Hazard your life and his, madam! did you &s;ay? Good heaven! what can he mean?" "Why, my dear, this&mdash;what &s;hall I call him? hu&s;band that would-be, is, for aught I know, going to deprive him&s;elf of a hand&s;ome wife, and good mother at once." Olivia who had been in&s;en|&s;ibly untying her cloak, now let it drop upon one arm&mdash;"Would you believe it? this ra&s;h Strephon, my dear, is going to leave us!" Olivia's cloak fell from her arm on the floor. "I did not think Henry would leave us&mdash;to|morrow is &s;omebody's birth-day!" "Yours!" exclaimed Henry, "I had forgot it"&mdash;"Forgot it! had you?" replied Olivia, "Would then it were the day of my death!" Henry, rather tottered than walked towards her, took her gently in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ing away her tears, "Happy be your birth-day, Olivia! Indi&s;po|&s;ition&mdash;you know how ill I have lately been,&mdash;
<PB N="83" REF="91">had hurried it a moment from my mind. I will &s;tay to ble&s;s it! and could Henry's wi&s;hes prevail, its returns &s;hould augment your felicity, until felicity could grant no more." Olivia rai&s;ed her head at the&s;e accents, which &s;eemed to have brought back not only the de&s;ire of living, but life it&s;elf. She dropped involuntarily upon her knee, then ri&s;ing &s;uddenly, influenced by the &s;ame emotion, and ca&s;ting an appealing glance, as if to ju&s;tify her un&s;peakable ten|derne&s;s, and blu&s;hing ten thou&s;and vir|tues, &s;he ran into the arms, which were thrown open to receive her. The two vener|able fathers and lady Fitzorton left their &s;eats, with one voice, exclaiming, "Ble&s;s! ble&s;s you together!" James &s;tood by, and lifting up his hands to heaven, reiterated the ble&s;&s;|ing, "Ble&s;s! ble&s;s you together!"</P>
<P>Olivia was now as much overcome with joy, as before &s;he had been overborne by &s;orrow. Lady Fitzorton received her from the arms of Henry, and every one a&s;&s;erted their right to enfold her. John, who happened to be at &s;ome di&s;tance, received her la&s;t;
<PB N="84" REF="92">and though he was not ea&s;ily moved, the whole &s;cene had affected him deeply.</P>
<P>The thought of e&s;tabli&s;hing happine&s;s in that innocent bo&s;om, which he had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the appearance of unfriendly neglect, operated on the generous di&s;po&s;ition of the amiable Henry, &s;o far as to produce a &s;atisfaction in his mind, to which it had for &s;ome time been a &s;tranger. Believing that he owed Olivia the atonement of unu&s;ual attention, and not being in a &s;ituation to reflect, a greater de|gree of that &s;oftne&s;s accompanied his manner, which was irre&s;i&s;tible, than he had for a long &s;ea&s;on dared to indulge. His melancholy now took that pen&s;ive &s;hade, who&s;e magic communicated a charm, when it was &s;o at|tempered, to every object around him; and this again melted gradually away, like tho&s;e thin mi&s;ts which often mingle in the &s;un|beams. In the progre&s;s of the evening, he &s;aid and did numberle&s;s things, which recon|ciled him to him&s;elf, and was &s;o evidently felt as a full recompence by Olivia, that the one had evidently forgot he was di&s;playing the fondne&s;s of a lover, and the other had
<PB N="85" REF="93">every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was the beloved object. Animated by the&s;e delu&s;ions, this too was the night, on which, had not Henry's "oath been in heaven," and the &s;ecret of his heart along with it, Olivia mu&s;t have triumphed; for never did &s;he look &s;o fair; never did &s;he repeat with &s;uch effect tho&s;e effu|&s;ions of the lyre, which &s;he knew were mo&s;t in his own e&s;teem; never did &s;he &s;trike the chords of his favourite in&s;trument with a touch &s;o tremblingly delicate; never did &s;he appear to feel &s;o much love for Henry, an affection &s;o fraternal for his brothers, nor &s;o filial a reverence for his parents.</P>
<P>John, in the cour&s;e of the evening, broke from company thrice, from &s;udden indi&s;po|&s;ition, but returned the in&s;tant he felt him|&s;elf recovered, and contributed his quota to the general joy: the gaiety increa&s;ed, the hours flew, and on Sir Armine hearing the clock &s;trike eleven, his u&s;ual hour of retreat, cried out, "Silence, tell-tale! you envy our happine&s;s, and would &s;horten it." "Rather," &s;aid his lady, "command it to go fa&s;ter, that
<PB N="86" REF="94">it may bring on the hour which gave birth to Olivia!"</P>
<P>As if this had &s;ugge&s;ted a new idea, Henry gave the rein to his creative fancy, and en|tering into the &s;pirit of the harmony that touched them all, hurried them from one &s;ubject to another, until warning was given for the twelfth hour; immediately upon which, he filled a goblet of Burgundy, and, as the clock was &s;triking, drank it on his knees, to the health and long life of Olivia Clare, before any other per&s;on could &s;eize the bottle. This, indeed, he held at arms length, repleni&s;hing with a rapidity, that made him pour one half of his libation on the floor, and then putting round the bottle to John, "I mu&s;t," &s;aid he, "complain of your delay, (though he had not even then parted with the bottle;) and he &s;wore that he could drink to the dregs, while &s;uch a tardy fellow was filling his gla&s;s." This declaration he accompanied by three huzzas! which he in|&s;i&s;ted upon &s;hould be joined by every one pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="95">The company were &s;o taken up with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of his voice, action, and addre&s;s, and were &s;o divided between one rapture and another, they had not time to think about them&s;elves. It was with difficulty that Olivia, betwixt one &s;en&s;ation and another, kept her little wits. She cried and laughed by turns; but both the&s;e emotions were the happy hy&s;|terics of the heart. She became pale and red alternately, and turning to lady Fitzorton, &s;he exclaimed, half drowned in tears, "that &s;he was the happie&s;t creature upon earth!" Then winding up the affections of the even|ing, to their highe&s;t pitch, filled her own gla&s;s, and expanding her lovely arms to the whole circle, exclaimed, "Ble&s;&s;ed be ye all! and may the hou&s;es of Fitzorton and of Clare be thus united for ever!"</P>
<P>John, who remained a few moments in the room, after the family had left it, &s;at thought|ful&mdash;"My father is right; there can no longer be any doubt of their affection. My bene|diction, then, &s;hall not be with-held&mdash;Ble&s;s them together!"</P>

<P>THESE little ebullitions of a heart, anxi|ous to make full re&s;titution for unintended offences, had, by this time, wrought &s;o &s;trongly on the enthu&s;ia&s;m of Henry, that they accompanied him into his apartment, after the &s;ocial circle, highly in humour with each other, had di&s;per&s;ed for the night. Be|fore he clo&s;ed his eyes, his imagination was on the wing, a&s;&s;i&s;ted not a little, by the effects of the Burgundy, yet more by the hilarity of the family, and above all, by the rich con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having him&s;elf been the chief cau&s;e, and he invoked his mu&s;e, which, like the harp of David, was his con&s;tant refuge in time of trouble, or of joy, to celebrate the anni|ver&s;ary of Olivia's birth. He addre&s;&s;ed to her a &s;onnet, in matter &s;o cha&s;te, and in manner &s;o delicate, even heated as he was, that the fair object of his compliment, but for that &s;weet prejudice of love, which applies every thing of this kind to it&s;elf, might have looked upon as the tribute of an affectionate brother,
<PB N="89" REF="97">"&s;mit with the love of &s;acred &s;ong," to his mo&s;t favoured &s;i&s;ter. Not that this &s;o nice accuracy of expre&s;&s;ion, re&s;ulted from an un|u&s;ual degree of care; for, be&s;ides that his pre&s;ent agreeable delirium bani&s;hed all &s;uch caution, he followed only that fraternal &s;en|timent, heightened, perhaps, by the late events, which was the extent of what he really felt for Olivia.</P>
<P>After Henry had revi&s;ed and tran&s;cribed his performance, the hurry into which his &s;pirits had been thrown by the preceding &s;cenes, terminated in a &s;ound repo&s;e. Not &s;uch the hi&s;tory of the tender-hearred Olivia, after &s;he bade her friends adieu. The exce&s;s of her joy &s;till continued, and bani&s;hed &s;leep. Morpheus is a timid and quiet power, that dares not venture to &s;hed his opiates on the pillow, until the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves are di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t. She would have thought the be&s;t offers of that drow&s;y god a wa&s;te of the precious hours. The &s;pirit of happy, and, as &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe, of mutual love, kept her beautiful eyes un|clo&s;ed. But, if Henry was lulled to re&s;t
<PB N="90" REF="98">while Olivia was without a wi&s;h to partake it, &s;he had the advantage of him, not only from pre&s;ent joy, but &s;uture delight; for he no &s;ooner opened his eyes, than he &s;aw, felt, and under&s;tood, the mi&s;chiefs to which the deliriums of the preceding evening would lead; and he had need of the refre&s;hments of &s;leep, and the renovations of &s;trength and life they brought with them, to &s;upport him on the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>He awoke, as from a voluptuous, yet di&s;|ordered dream, after a night of intemperance. A train of circum&s;tances had taken place, which, he fore&s;aw, would not only augment the pa&s;&s;ion of Olivia, but give her and the families rea&s;on to believe he had him&s;elf been acce&s;&s;ary to its increa&s;e. "Heavens!" ex|claimed he, &s;tarting from his bed! "every ingredient I have admini&s;tered, by way of an|tidote, has not only increa&s;ed the force of the poi&s;on, but is, in it&s;elf, compounded of poi&s;ons the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and malignant&mdash;and this too is the birth-day of Olivia!"</P>
<P>He aro&s;e ha&s;tily. The fir&s;t object that engaged his attention was, the &s;onnet which
<PB N="91" REF="99">had given him &s;o much generous joy in the compo&s;ition. He now con&s;idered it as an abettor, in the general perplexity, and was upon the point of &s;acrificing it to his re&s;ent|ment, when Sir Armine and James came into his room. "I am here, Sir," &s;aid his father, "to rebuke your idlene&s;s, when your mi&s;|tre&s;s and your mu&s;e ought to have rou&s;ed you the fir&s;t in the hou&s;e. Your beloved has been tripping round the garden the&s;e two hours, and her charming blu&s;hes, which &s;ur|pa&s;s the ro&s;es &s;he has been culling for you, ingrate, upbraid your lazine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, my dear Sir," replied Henry, as if willing to explain, "there is &s;uch a com|plication of mi&s;takes&mdash;&s;uch a &s;trange &s;eries of&mdash;of&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mi&s;takes!" rejoined his father, ob&s;erv|ing the &s;onnet, that had been ha&s;tily thrown on the dre&s;&s;ing-table on his entrance&mdash;"Yes&mdash; yes, I &s;ee now in what the mi&s;takes con&s;i&s;t"&mdash; as I live, a poem to the 'lady Olivia's eye|brow'&mdash; &s;ee&mdash;&s;tanzas, &s;acred to the birth-day of"&mdash;. Here, his father recited the fir&s;t couplet, and then taking hold of Henry with
<PB N="92" REF="100">one hand, and James with the other, hurried with them down &s;tairs into the breakfa&s;t|parlour, but exclaiming at every &s;tep, "I will lofe no time in clearing up the&s;e mi&s;takes I am determined."</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely opened the door of the apartment, in which the families were a&s;&s;em|bled, than he gave the anniver&s;ary offering to the &s;weet Olivia. She had that moment fini&s;hed a fragrant tribute; her&s;elf far more lovely than the faire&s;t of the flowers &s;he had collected. Sir Armine turning to Henry, exclaimed, "why do&s;t thou not offer them on thy knees, thou love-lorn Damon? Ha&s;t thou forgot the pro&s;trations due to a godde&s;s, when thou would&s;t &s;acrifice?&mdash;but, I &s;up|po&s;e, the poor trembling mortal is afraid le&s;t his offering &s;hould prove unworthy of the &s;hrine."</P>
<P>Thus was it rendered every way impo&s;&s;i|ble for Henry to negative a word, and his very &s;ilence was naturally enough converted to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive awe, which is apprehen&s;ive it never can pre&s;ent any thing worthy the acceptance of a beloved object.</P>

<P>INDEED, &s;uch was the undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;in|cerity with which Olivia acknowledged, and &s;uch the impa&s;&s;ioned gratitude and &s;weetne&s;s with which &s;he received the poetical tribute; it would have been more than churli&s;h in Henry, to have found utterance for a &s;entence that might chill the innocent delight it had created; and this delight was &s;o vi&s;ible in the whole countenance of Olivia, that &s;ome of its radiance &s;eemed to be reflected back even upon John; who, approaching her with one of his be&s;t bows, "albeit unu&s;ed to the bending mood," ejaculated with unwonted fervor, "This is, my dear Olivia, the only moment of my regret, that the gods have not made me as poetical as Henry!&mdash;and if <HI>he</HI> had not invoked his mu&s;e, I feel that I &s;hould for the fir&s;t, and probably, the la&s;t time of my life, have tried <HI>my</HI> hand at an acro&s;tic at lea&s;t. From Apollo and the nine young godde&s;&s;es I &s;hould have had nothing to expect: for I was not born under a rhyming
<PB N="94" REF="102">&s;tar; neither would Aganippe, Helicon, nor Ca&s;talia, have done any thing for me: for I was never dipped in the &s;treams of fancy, nor could I have looked for better luck from Pega&s;us or Parna&s;&s;us: for I had never the art of managing a winged hor&s;e, nor of clambering up an imaginary mountain; but if there is ought of in&s;piration, in actual exi&s;tent beauty, grace, and goodne&s;s, 'as it lives, moves, and has a being,' in Olivia, <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;hould her&s;elf have been both my &s;ubject and my mu&s;e: and I will be judged even by Henry here," clap|ping his brother on the &s;houlder, "if &s;uch in&s;pirations are not of more potency than all the fictions of the heathen mythology!"</P>
<P>This unexpected gallantry on the part of the philo&s;opher, as, on account of the debat|ing &s;pirit, and &s;ententious gravity, they u&s;ed to call him, enlivened the company.</P>
<P>To heighten the intere&s;t of all this, Lady Fitzorton, who&s;e fine countenance illumined at &s;ome of the &s;entiments of the birth-day ver&s;es, began to read them aloud, pau&s;ing at every &s;tanza, as well to pay a ju&s;t tribute to the genius of a beloved &s;on, as to afford the
<PB N="95" REF="103">re&s;t of the company opportunity to join in his prai&s;e. The commentary written on the features of every face in the progre&s;s of his mother's recital, in&s;inuated into his heart &s;o delicate a falttery, that not to have been touched with it, would have placed him above or below the feelings of humanity. But if we could even &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that the general incen&s;e which was offered to a young man in full a&s;&s;embly, had fallen &s;hort of its effect, upon a di&s;po&s;ition grateful and ingenu|ous as his, the particular homage which it drew from Olivia her&s;elf, could not but have fully made up the deficiency. She did not, indeed, utter a &s;yllable, nor was it nece&s;&s;ary. The words of love, it has been ob&s;erved, &s;leep in the ear that is too dull to comprehend its &s;ilence. A maxim happily verified in the countenance of our Olivia, who&s;e eyes &s;park|led, cheeks glowed, and tears dropt, &s;o as to &s;hew mo&s;t eloquently the excellency and the graces of her nature. In addition to which, &s;he had, even in the &s;election of the morning bouquet, con&s;ulted tho&s;e three great ma&s;ters of effect,&mdash;time, place, and circum&s;tance. Mo&s;t
<PB N="96" REF="104">of the flowers were emblematic, or could ea&s;ily be brought to apply, to the ca&s;e in point. The maiden's pride was relieved by the vir|gin's blu&s;h, and this again was veiled in laurel leaves. The &s;weet-brier, which has &s;o &s;trong an allu&s;ion to the pains and plea&s;ures of at|tachment, was &s;kilfully placed in the mid&s;t of a bunch of love-lies-bleeding, around which was entwined not only balm of Gilead, but plenty of double bal&s;ams, and over the whole were di&s;per&s;ed heart's-ea&s;e and the maiden's delight.</P>

<P>THUS did every moment tend to ac|cumulate cau&s;es of &s;atisfaction to the re&s;t of the &s;ociety, and increa&s;e the difficulty for Henry to breathe an accent of di&s;content; or to give any of his friends the &s;malle&s;t idea that &s;uch di&s;content was in his bo&s;om. The anniver&s;ary hours pa&s;t &s;miling on, and although Henry could not be betrayed into the hilarities of the preceding night, when he
<PB N="97" REF="105">wholly forgot him&s;elf in others: although, neither the powers of wit, or of wine, nor the more animating &s;en&s;ation of genius receiving its reward from beauty, love, and family affection, could allure him out of &s;ome memory of him&s;elf, he was too much wrought upon by &s;eeing every face happy about him, to damp, by any ill-timed gravity, the gene|ral joy. On the contrary, his behaviour was perhaps more touching even than before; for his exce&s;&s;ive gaiety, which was rather a &s;train upon his nature, and might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have left him &s;omewhat exhau&s;ted, was exchanged for a &s;ofter pen&s;ivene&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s. Indeed, Henry was never &s;o perfectly attract|ing, as when a certain tender &s;hade, like a thin clouding over the &s;un, veiled the efful|gence of his genius: if his happine&s;s, there|fore, now appeared le&s;s vehement, it was thought more genuine, and if a more &s;erious &s;igh than he intended e&s;caped him, he would him&s;elf break its effect by a &s;mile that cha&s;ed away all &s;u&s;picion of latent anxiety. Before the a&s;&s;embly broke up, his &s;pirits rallied, his happy powers were again exerted, and when
<PB N="98" REF="106">each per&s;on bade adieu to the other, it would have been difficult for a tran&s;ient &s;pectator to &s;uppo&s;e there had been any aching hearts among&s;t the company.</P>
<P>Some aching hearts, however, there were, and one of them throbbed in the brea&s;t of Henry. No &s;ooner had this devoted youth gained his own apartment, than the con|&s;trained part he had acted for &s;uch a number of hours, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed him, a thou&s;and emotions at once &s;truggled for vent, and could be relieved only by a flood of tears. The hap|le&s;s youth had done the utmo&s;t, that a regard for the happine&s;s of others could in&s;pire. He had yielded to occurrences not in his power to fore&s;ee, or to obviate; and for two days together, without a po&s;&s;ibility of pre|venting it, had been the &s;acrifice of contin|gencies.</P>
<P>It is now high time we &s;hould account for this extraordinary degree of mi&s;ery in Henry, while &s;o many other dearly loved individuals, of both families, were happy. The reader, indeed, would have good rea&s;on to accu&s;e him of unpardonable caprice, or of &s;trange
<PB N="99" REF="107">in&s;en&s;ibility, if &s;ome motive, &s;trong as honour, and aweful as fate, had not fixed in his mind an in&s;uperable objection to the plan, which was carrying on for his union with Olivia. In order, therefore, to ju&s;tify his determined oppo&s;ition to the family mea&s;ures, it is nece&s;|&s;ary the reader &s;hould now be informed of that &s;ecret which he held &s;acred, and "pluck out the heart of his my&s;tery."</P>
<P>And yet, we have hitherto employed our&s;elves, in bringing the reader acquainted with &s;o many good and benign characters, and &s;eating him by their comfortable and &s;ocial fire-&s;ide, in a manner, like one of the family: that it is not without regret, we are now to lead him farther into the neighbour|hood; where he mu&s;t meet with &s;ome per&s;ons of a different de&s;cription. But if Paradi&s;e had its &s;erpent and its fiend, it cannot fairly be expected, that Fitzorton Ca&s;tle &s;hould have been without &s;omething to denote its being placed in a mixed and imperfect world.</P>
<P>Yet, if thy mind, O reader! like Olivia Clare's, is of that pure and virgin innocency, incapable of having devi&s;ed, or practi&s;ed,
<PB N="100" REF="108">any thing which has &s;ullied its native white|ne&s;s, it will feel a pang, unknown before, to be &s;hewn the &s;pots, which have darkened and deba&s;ed the mind of another. To be the fir&s;t to inflict this pang, can only be compen|&s;ated by the good effects, which may be adduced from it; for it were to be wi&s;hed, thou &s;houlde&s;t remain, even all thy life long, as unknowing of the wickedne&s;s of the world, as incapable of adding to it: and, indeed, that the purity of thy own &s;oul, &s;hould, as it did in her ca&s;e, lead thee to a firm belief, no &s;uch wickedne&s;s exi&s;ted in that world: deeming thy&s;elf, but one, among&s;t all the millions that people it, who pre&s;erve undefiled the expre&s;s image of thy maker. But as &s;uch credulity, alas! is incompatible with&mdash;we had almo&s;t &s;aid,&mdash;the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch innocence, we think it fitting thou &s;houlde&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be prepared for the en&s;narers, and the &s;nares thou maye&s;t po&s;&s;ibly meet with in, perhaps, thy long journey, through the mazy windings of human life. If, then, in this faithful record of what has really been &s;aying and doing
<PB N="101" REF="109">in the world, almo&s;t, &s;ince its beginning, and will, probably, continue to its end, we hold up to thee &s;ome &s;triking contra&s;ts to the characters already introduced; and which were in perfect &s;ympathy with thy princi|ples, and affections; con&s;ider us only, as acting the part of tender parents, who&s;e protecting roof thou art about to quit, for bu&s;y &s;cenes beyond their reach; and who, before they tru&s;t thee from their arms, di&s;|cover to thee the perils by which thou art environ'd, warning thee to beware!</P>
<P>We mentioned a third man&s;ion, within the view of Fitzorton Ca&s;tle, and the Manor-hou&s;e of Clare. This edifice, was called Gui&s;e|abbey, the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of which, was Sir Gui&s;e Lorrain Stuart, who&s;e ance&s;|tors had been among&s;t the partizans of the Queen of Scots, while tho&s;e of Sir Armine, had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as the mo&s;t zealous &s;upporters in the royal army. Sir Gui&s;e had &s;till in his family, &s;everal reliques of the Prince&s;s, who is &s;aid, by hi&s;torians, to have been unmatched in beauty, and un|equalled in misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="110">The fillet and veil that bound the beaute|ous eyes of the Scotti&s;h Queen, the rich habit of &s;ilk and velvet, in which &s;he arrayed her lovely form, and the ivory crucifix, which &s;he held in her hand on the morning of her ex|ecution, were yet pre&s;erved in an apartment called Mary's room. On the other hand, and with no le&s;s pride of character and blood, Sir Armine enrolled in the line of his ance&s;tors, the chancellor, who affixed the &s;eal to the warrant for Mary's death; another kin&s;man, was one of the Earls to whom the fatal in&s;trument was confided, with orders to &s;ee the bloody commi&s;&s;ion, which it bore, duly executed: and the portraits of the&s;e per&s;ons, were &s;till to be &s;een at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Nor had the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, or of Fitz|orton, been more zealou&s;ly attached to the dome&s;tic conflicts, which happened between tho&s;e rival &s;overeigns, Elizabeth and Mary, than to their religious tenets.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;evere &s;hock their friend&s;hip received, was occa&s;ioned by a very fierce conte&s;t, that &s;prung up after dinner, at the
<PB N="103" REF="111">Abbey, on the very day that Sir Armine made the overture vi&s;it, de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h a good under&s;tanding between them as gentle|men and neighbours, however little they might accord in matters of Church or State. After Sir Gui&s;e had drank "forgetfulne&s;s of the pa&s;t," in a half pint bumper of claret, he a&s;&s;erted, "that, to &s;hew his neighbour all was abliviated, although he would drink three more half pints to the memory of Queen Mary:"&mdash;here, he filled and emptied with &s;peed;&mdash;"Sir Armine was welcome to pay what homage he plea&s;ed to her mur|derer!" Sir Armine reddened.</P>
<P>But Sir Gui&s;e, before the meeting, had poured down his throat nearly the quarrelling quantity. Sir Armine bore it long, with right chri&s;tian patience, moving now and then in his chair, &s;triking a tune with his fingers on the table, and twice &s;hifting his &s;eat, grinding however, at different pau&s;es, the indige&s;tible word "murderer!" "Why, that &s;he was a mo&s;t foul murderer in this in&s;tance," reiterated Sir Gui&s;e, filling his gla&s;s, "I pre&s;ume, there is not a man living
<PB N="104" REF="112">will dare to deny." "I dare, &s;ir," returned Sir Armine, bounding up, and taking half the room at a &s;tride. "Then who was?" retorted Sir Gui&s;e; "Mary! your Mary!" "'Tis fal&s;e, &s;ir!" replied Sir Gui&s;e, hurrying down another bumper, from who&s;e aid he derived a courage not his own;&mdash;"by the illu&s;trious &s;pirit of her, who&s;e wrongs fill my &s;oul, no le&s;s than her blood my veins, 'tis fal&s;e!"&mdash;here, he &s;truck the table with his &s;pread hand, and threw the gla&s;s in which he had been drinking, on the ground;&mdash; "wi&s;hing,"&mdash;as he &s;tampt upon the frag|ments, "that all the enemies of that ill-fated woman, were cru&s;hed into du&s;t in the like manner." Sir Armine threw up the &s;a&s;h for air, then rang violently: on a &s;ervant's ap|pearing, he "ordered his carriage," in a voice &s;carcely articulate, folding his tremb|ling hands, and turning up his fla&s;hing eyes, as if to implore the &s;uccour of the God of long-&s;uffering, to grant him a few more moments of patience. But Sir Gui&s;e, unwil|ling to lo&s;e the time before him, adopted the wor&s;t character that hi&s;tory has recorded of
<PB N="105" REF="113">Sir Armine's heroine, ri&s;ing in his aggrava|tions at every word.</P>
<P>Sir Armine oppo&s;ed to this, the rever&s;e of the picture, ran&s;acking the inexhau&s;ted &s;tores of his memory, for tho&s;e hi&s;torical te&s;timonies of this Prince&s;s's activity, pru|dence, and di&s;cernment: "but above all," added he, "her vigorous and immortal de|fence, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion&mdash;a pro|te&s;tant Queen, led as it were by the hand of the Almighty to a prote&s;tant throne, even till popery became her foot&s;tool."</P>
<P>"I &s;ay," cried Sir Gui&s;e, &s;tarting up and &s;taggering; "I &s;ay, with the be&s;t hi&s;torians, the whole exi&s;tence of this queen, this pre|tended virgin, was a ti&s;&s;ue of fal&s;ehood, in|&s;incerity, and cunning." He then run into an elaborate defence, equally intemperate, of the queen of Scots, contra&s;ting it with the mo&s;t violent &s;arca&s;ms on Elizabeth.</P>
<P>This bur&s;t of acrimony called forth all that was irritable in Sir Armine. "O &s;hame where is thy blu&s;h! can &s;he find a vindicator at this time of day: and a vindicator in one who a&s;pires to the friend&s;hip of Sir Armine Fitzorton&mdash;Fie upon it, Sir Gui&s;e!&mdash;Are then
<PB N="106" REF="114">the credulous Darnley, the execrable Both|well, the abandoned Rozzio, the infamous Douglas all forgotten? Are the &s;elf-con|demning letters, &s;eductive &s;onnets, and &s;edi|tious pacquets, all vani&s;hed from your memory?"</P>
<P>"Lies! lies! forgeries! damnable forgeries," raved Sir Gui&s;e, "all deeds of darkne&s;s worked in that gulf of &s;in the &s;oul of Elizabeth! Did not your cloth protect you"&mdash;"My cloth is no protection," replied Sir Armine, "nay, 'tis my proper robe of defence, and reminds me of the duty of puni&s;hing a de|famer of the glorious defender of the faith I profe&s;s, and of the holy religion of which I am a mini&s;ter"&mdash;"But," continued Sir Armine, &s;omewhat recovering him&s;elf, "I have done with you for ever, Sir&mdash;it is well &s;or thee that the blood of the Fitzortons, rather than that of the Stuarts, fills my veins." This menace had effect enough on Sir Gui&s;e to make him congratulate him&s;elf on the de|parture of the menacer.</P>
<P>This &s;pecimen of their political difference, indeed, is allowed a place merely to &s;hew an
<PB N="107" REF="115">important feature in the di&s;pute between the families; but we mu&s;t, thus early, enter a caveat again&s;t the reader's expecting any more on the &s;ubject, unle&s;s, by tran&s;ient reference, it may be nece&s;&s;ary; as it is by no means our intention to mix dome&s;tic annals with contro|ver&s;ial hi&s;tory, on a point that will probably remain in violent contention to the end of time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the per&s;onal accom|pli&s;hments of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, they were yet &s;ufficiently attractive to be numbered among&s;t the &s;hining &s;nares that involved his admirers. Con&s;idering the excellence of his con&s;titu|tion, which even the &s;uicide hand of intem|perance had not been able hitherto to un|dermine, the Baronet might &s;till be &s;aid to enjoy the prime of life. Although he was by nature &s;tubborn, he became flexible by art, &s;uperficial in under&s;tanding, but profound in deceit, by means of which he won not only the e&s;teem of a nobleman eminent for his knowledge of mankind, but the love of that nobleman's heir and only child Matilda, with
<PB N="108" REF="116">whom Sir Gui&s;e received fifty thou&s;and pounds on the day of marriage, and the like &s;um the year following at her father's death.</P>
<P>Select, reader, from among&s;t the productions of nature &s;ome flower as the emblem of &s;oft|ne&s;s, humility, fragrance, and beauty; give to it that unre&s;i&s;ting, and appealing delicacy, which trembles at the gale that it perfumes, and thou wilt have a ju&s;t idea of Matilda Edgecumbe.</P>
<P>Then call to thy imagination &s;ome noxious, but fair-looking, plant, able, from the &s;trength of its &s;tem, and vigour of its foliage, to endure the rude&s;t &s;torm, extending its "marriageable arms" to protect the lovely flower, while that flower &s;eems to thrive under its &s;helter; but &s;oon the bitter and oppre&s;&s;ive leaves of evil growth, overwhelm with their &s;hade and bla&s;t, with their poi&s;onous qualities, all that are beneath. Hence wilt thou gain &s;ome feeble image of Matilda's hu&s;band. Who is &s;eared by all the weak, &s;ays a philo&s;o|pher, de&s;pi&s;ed by all the &s;trong, and hated by all the good, may &s;ecurely &s;ay to him&s;elf, no matter if there be no other ra&s;cal left on earth, I am &s;till one: and the Baronet might
<PB N="109" REF="117">very &s;afely give him&s;elf this con&s;olation. The impracticable temper and offen&s;ive man|ners of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, his habits of riotous loquacity, or of &s;ullen gloom, &s;oon loo&s;ened his hold on all good men: nor had he indeed been even on conver&s;ation terms with the Fitzortons or Clares for &s;ome years. Anxious indeed to live in charity and peace with all mankind, and from the goodne&s;s of his own di&s;po&s;ition, as well as from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own infirmity, always imputing to him&s;elf a &s;hare in the cau&s;e of e&s;trangement; Sir Armine had &s;o far alleviated the party rage, produced by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the merits of the two Queens, as to give Mary's champion a meeting &s;ome time after at the manor-hou&s;e, in the life time of Mrs. Clare, who had been intimate with Lady Stuart's mother: and then it was that Olivia Clare, and the female part of the Abbey family, were for a few days thrown together; and an unbroken amity would on their part have en&s;ued, particularly between the ladies, had not the &s;tormy Sir Gui&s;e thrown, as u&s;ual, an intercepting cloud over the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="118">Unable &s;incerely to forget or to forgive what pa&s;t on the &s;ubject of Mary and Elizabeth, or indeed any injury, yet wanting the manly courage, hone&s;tly to re&s;ent it, he did every thing that in him lay to make the contiguity of the e&s;tates of tho&s;e families to the Abbey lands matter of di&s;pute: yet at once a&s;hamed and afraid to di&s;clo&s;e the real motives, he added fal&s;ehood to malice! In the da&s;tardly hope of covering them.&mdash;Under pretence of removing di&s;agreeable objects, he de|moli&s;hed &s;everal picture&s;que fragments and ruins, which had been of great effect in dif|ferent points of view from the ca&s;tle. From Sir Armine's plea&s;ure ground the eye could, formerly, take in a fine cataract, which rolled down the rocks through the fore&s;t, the ob|&s;tructions of which had been cleared away by Sir Gui&s;e's father on purpo&s;e to enrich the pro&s;pect: this al&s;o, giving out that it mu&s;t certainly annoy eyes and ears, the imperious Baronet ob&s;cured, with &s;uch <HI>malice of de&s;ign,</HI> that in&s;tead of a cataract the eye was offended by an invidious &s;creen of clay, ill thatched and purpo&s;ely disfigured, &s;o as to re&s;emble
<PB N="111" REF="119">the dead blank of an enormous barn; he gave it the air of tumbling to pieces, be|cau&s;e he &s;aid his neighbour loved ruins, and the&s;e were a &s;ub&s;tituted improvement on the fragments he had before taken away. Various openings in the fore&s;t gave peeps of &s;everal towns, &s;pires, and buildings, and all the&s;e were likewi&s;e clo&s;ed; and the abbey it&s;elf, which formed one of the noble&s;t objects to the ca&s;tle, was by one contrivance or another, even to Sir Gui&s;e's own inconvenience, &s;o intercepted, as to be completely &s;hut out from ob&s;ervation. One a&s;piring tower at the top of the abbey,&mdash;which he remembered, in the days of intercour&s;e, to have heard Sir Armine ob&s;erve it had &s;tood as the friend&s;hip of their progenitors, and tru&s;ted it would remain &s;uch to their po&s;terity,&mdash;he en|clo&s;ed in a wooden ca&s;e, becau&s;e he in&s;idiou&s;ly &s;aid it would <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> it, though in effect it became an object of even more deformity than it had ever been of beauty. The &s;pirit which incited him to the&s;e acts of &s;ubordinate meanne&s;s being treated with manly contempt by Sir Armine, his neighbour's malignity be|came
<PB N="112" REF="120">more di&s;coverable in matters of greater con&s;equence; he forbade his wife, children, and every part of his family, or dome&s;tics, to mix with, or &s;peak to, tho&s;e of Fitzorton, or Clare, on peril of his utmo&s;t re&s;entment; warned both hou&s;es not to tre&s;pa&s;s on his ma|nors; &s;et up a pack of harriers and fox-hounds, though a fearful rider, and no &s;port&s;man, and, to the de&s;truction of nur&s;eries, fences, and plantations, ran the dogs and game to the gates of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e pur&s;uits, Sir Armine, who had been at that time enjoying the peace of benevolence, and the beauty of nature, with his &s;on John, in his own grounds, was &s;o ex|a&s;perated at the wanton triumph of Sir Gui&s;e, as he rode by him full &s;peed, blurting the mud in his face, though no game had been found, that John, lifting up the cane with which he had been walking &s;hook it at the Baronet, and exclaimed in an almo&s;t whi&s;per|ing voice, "Villain! there wanted but this, and I thank thee for it, even though at the price of an in&s;ult to my father! I am thy debtor!" Sir Gui&s;e, who was within hearing of
<PB N="113" REF="121">the menace, turned his hor&s;e &s;uddenly, and in the head-long fury of his vengeance, for|getting his u&s;ual di&s;cretion, rode round both the father and &s;on in a circle &s;o narrow, as al|mo&s;t to cover them within length of his whip. Guiding his hor&s;e &s;o as to draw him &s;till nearer, John caught the &s;kirts of the coat, and had nearly di&s;mounted him, when Sir Gui&s;e, &s;purring the hor&s;e with great violence, backing him at the &s;ame time, the animal was forcibly drawn upon the venerable Ar|mine, who, in falling, received a blow in the left &s;ide, and might have been trampled to death, had not John Fitzorton, at the hazard of his own life, &s;truck the hor&s;e with &s;uch force as to make him &s;pring forward and throw the rider. "Coward! a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!" mut|tered John, but &s;till with governed articula|tion, "did not a &s;uperior duty claim my fir&s;t attentions, I would cha&s;ti&s;e thee as I ought!" John held in his arms his fainting father while he &s;pake, then carried him to the park-cot|tage, ca&s;ting over him a look of love and terrour, that for the moment ab&s;orbed his indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="122">Of this blow Sir Armine fell &s;ick, and un|derwent a tedious confinement; in the cour&s;e of which the tender love borne to the vene|rable man by his own family, and that of the Clares', was variou&s;ly manife&s;ted. Lady Fitzorton, and the gentle Olivia, were, by turns, his nur&s;e. John pre&s;erved the virtues of his character. He had, for motives which will be explained, recently entered the army, and but for this accident, was about to join his regiment; and Henry, though at this time more frequently, and for a greater length of time ab&s;ent, di&s;covered, whenever he ap|peared, a degree of trouble and anxiety even &s;uperior to that of John. James was in London.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Sir Armine quitted his bed, than he &s;ummoned John into his apartment, and de&s;iring him to &s;it down near enough to receive confidential di&s;cour&s;e, "My dear John," &s;aid the good man, "I have &s;elected you from the re&s;t of my &s;ons, not becau&s;e I love you better, but becau&s;e there is in you more of that firmne&s;s which I have occa&s;ion to employ.

My &s;on I &s;hall in a few days be in a &s;ituation to wipe it away. I abhor all impotent menaces, and, therefore, I &s;pake not of this till the power was added to the will; but even now that they are pre|paring to unite, be&s;ides that I hold the mo|dern deci&s;ions in &s;corn, let me hone&s;tly pour my&s;elf into your bo&s;om.

"Unnece&s;&s;ary!" exclaimed Sir Armine, who ro&s;e and walked acro&s;s the room for the fir&s;t time &s;ince his illne&s;s, un&s;upported. "Ill &s;hould I de&s;erve your confidence, had I per|mitted the &s;pot of which you &s;peak to remain &s;o long on us." Sir Armine's colour gathered in his cheek&mdash;"Explain, Sir!" cried he: John di&s;appeared, but returning, gave an in&s;trument to Sir Armine, &s;aying "It was this, Sir, which cut out our &s;tain&mdash;See it is &s;potted with the blood of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart."</P>
<P>"Dead! I tru&s;t in God, not dead!" ex|claimed his father, un&s;heathing the &s;word with one hand, and gra&s;ping the arm of John
<PB N="117" REF="125">with the other, &s;ometimes looking at the &s;word, and &s;ometimes at his &s;on. "The triumph of an ignoble mind going on, per|haps, to our di&s;grace, I &s;ought and met the aggre&s;&s;or, with his &s;on Charles. I told him I came as my father's repre&s;entative. The vil|lain would have fled; but partly by &s;hame, partly by force, he rai&s;ed his arm, and we fought. I pierced his brea&s;t, and &s;hould have gained his worthle&s;s heart, but that he threw down his &s;word, and with a coward's &s;peed, fled to the abbey." "We are alone, Mr. Fitzorton," &s;aid Charles, "this is an affair that admits not parly." He threw him|&s;elf into a po&s;ture of attack; "Unle&s;s, Charles, you think the blood of an hone&s;t man can expunge the infamy of a &s;coundrel," replied I, "it would be well to de&s;i&s;t." The brave youth pau&s;ed, and ru&s;hed into my arms: he felt too powerful for utterance. I gave him my hand: he wept with tender|ne&s;s, and blu&s;hed with &s;hame.</P>
<P>The varied emotions and pa&s;&s;ions which Sir Armine had undergone, during this expla|nation, added to the length of the pau&s;es, in
<PB N="118" REF="126">which he was obliged to indulge him&s;elf, kept him clo&s;eted with John until the re&s;t of the family began to &s;u&s;pect it was occa&s;ioned by his having relap&s;ed, and by John's endea|vours to re&s;tore him without alarming the re&s;t of the family; lady Fitzorton, therefore, ha&s;tened into the library, attended by James, Mr. Clare, Olivia, and Henry. Sir Armine, hearing them on the &s;tairs, ordered John to throw open the door, and &s;carce giving them time to enter, he leaped up in an ex&s;tacy, ex|claiming to his wife&mdash;"Madam, embrace your &s;on; to him you owe the eternal &s;hame of the Stuarts, and the glory of the Fitz|ortons.&mdash; Boys, acknowledge a brother, who has re&s;cued your father, your&s;elves, and your po&s;terity."</P>
<P>At the name of the Stuarts, Henry turned paler than death, and upon his exclaiming, "Has any thing, Sir, happened to the Stuarts?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"That has happened, boy," rejoined Sir Armine, "which"&mdash;"Your pardon, Sir, the name of Charles Stuart, a brave young man, a brother officer, and the friend of Henry, is
<PB N="119" REF="127">involved in this affair, and it &s;hould not be talked of. Indulge and honour me &s;o far as to forbear again the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Our father, you know, my brother, is always too good, and gives to common duties im|mea&s;ureable rewards."</P>
<P>He &s;poke with a dignity that demanded obedience, even from a parent, and left the room. "Noble youth!" exclaimed his fa|ther, "my prai&s;e, my gratitude, my ble&s;&s;ing follow thee!"</P>
<P>Soon after this occurrence, the quarrel &s;ettled into an inveteracy, &s;o generou&s;ly avowed on the part of Sir Armine, and &s;o meanly clande&s;tine on that of Sir Gui&s;e, there was not left the &s;malle&s;t hope of the breach being repaired. Indeed, religion, manners, and morals, &s;eparated this turbulent and over|bearing man from the worthy Fitzortons.</P>
<P>Yet had this turbulent and over-bearing man a daughter, who in mind and manners contra&s;ted her father. Caroline Stuart to the brighte&s;t powers of the intellect, adjoined the &s;ofte&s;t affections of the heart; nor, had her cultivated endowments taken any thing from
<PB N="120" REF="128">that touching &s;implicity, which is the charm of female youth. Her face was le&s;s exactly beautiful than that of Olivia Clare; but was of that intere&s;ting kind, it was impo&s;&s;ible to be looked upon, without a certain tenderne&s;s, to which every feature of it laid claim. Her eyes, though wanting the effulgence that beamed from tho&s;e of Olivia, were of a lu&s;tre &s;o extremely mild, that they appealed to the protection of every beholder, and ap|pealed not in vain. Her &s;hape had le&s;s of maje&s;ty, but more of grace, than that of Olivia. Her whole figure, indeed, wanted Olivia's dignity, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a no le&s;s at|tractive ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In one part of Caroline's character, there &s;eemed to be an incon&s;i&s;tency. Although her heart overflowed with the mo&s;t melting &s;en|&s;ibility, her mind was &s;o firm, as to have rarely abated any thing in tho&s;e points, which &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;hed as matters of duty&mdash;and this was carried, from her earlie&s;t days, to &s;uch an extreme, that while her heart ap|peared properly to belong to her as one of the mo&s;t tender of her own &s;ex, her mind,
<PB N="121" REF="129">for by that word can we only make the di&s;|tinction, &s;eemed to form the mo&s;t intrepid feature of what has been thought heroic in ours. Thus, for in&s;tance, no tyranny of her father, who&s;e &s;tern commands might be ex|pected to &s;hake the nature of &s;o gentle a being, ever gave the air of reluctant obedi|ence. "Di&s;po&s;e of the life you gave, Sir," &s;he would &s;ay, "as you plea&s;e, I &s;ubmit"&mdash; She often felt the wrong, fore&s;aw the con&s;e|quence, in &s;ecret mourned the error, but never que&s;tioned the authority. "Implicit obedience," has &s;he been heard to ob&s;erve, "might be weakne&s;s rather than &s;trength in me; but in this ca&s;e, I do not belong to my|&s;elf, and where the author of my exi&s;tence is concerned, I feel my&s;elf as having no judg|ment, no will, no rea&s;on, nor any of tho&s;e faculties, which, in every other circum&s;tance of life, I am free to exerci&s;e."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader has anticipated the power of Caroline Stuart over the heart of Henry Fitzorton. He &s;ees that &s;he was a &s;ucce&s;sful rival of the no le&s;s amiable Olivia; not that her character corre&s;ponded more with that of Henry, for it was, in &s;ome re&s;pects, le&s;s con|genial; and congeniality has been thought an univer&s;al magnet. But there had happened in early life one circum&s;tance, which exalted Caroline above all compari&s;on on the throne of Henry's affections, and e&s;tabli&s;hed her there too &s;tedfa&s;tly for the whole &s;ex to &s;up|plant her, even had every other woman been an Olivia. Caroline had the advantage of a fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. She had been the &s;ecret godde&s;s of his idolatry an whole year, before his other little playmate; and though not an inmate of his family, the hou&s;es of Fitzorton and Stuart having become formal vi&s;itors prior to this aera, yet had Henry, who hap|pened to be in friend&s;hip with Charles, the
<PB N="123" REF="131">only &s;on and only favourite of Sir Gui&s;e, fre|quent opportunities of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with little Caroline. Olivia Clare was at that time with a relation in London, her mother being then recently dead.</P>
<P>What mighty revolutions in human affairs have not twelve months, twelve days pro|duced? In ca&s;es of the heart, a &s;ingle hour has &s;ometimes decided its choice, even be|yond the power of mortal change.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e had conceived an early di&s;like to|wards Caroline, which bordered on antipathy. The principal rea&s;on for which was, not &s;o much his inordinate affection for Charles, as her being tenderly beloved of her mother lady Stuart, whom the Baronet dete&s;ted with an abhorrence, yet more deadly than that he bore his daughter; for it was founded on the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing virtues, which at once excited his di&s;grace and envy. Lady Stuart had all the meekne&s;s of her daughter, but none of her magnanimity. Her &s;pirits &s;unk before the brutal violence of her hu&s;|band, who, when he did not find it for the intere&s;t of &s;ome favourite point to be gloom|ily
<PB N="124" REF="132">&s;ilent like an in&s;idious calm, was vehement as an hurricane, that de&s;olates every thing in its path; and poor lady Stuart was driven in terror before it, as the atom is driven by the whirlwind: whereas little Caroline &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock, unmoved, without oppo&s;ing it. It is hard to &s;ay which conduct mo&s;t exa&s;pe|rated Sir Gui&s;e: that of his lady he regarded as contemptible weakne&s;s; and he he&s;itated not to pronounce that of his daughter, ob&s;ti|nate &s;tupidity. The terrors of his wife, ter|minated in that uncomplaining mi&s;ery, which is dumb through fear; and he frequently &s;wore Caroline wanted voice, only becau&s;e &s;he wanted feeling. This deci&s;ion incited him to new modes of tyranny, to innovations in the art of tormenting. But if the be|haviour of Sir Gui&s;e was thus odious, that of young Caroline was in the &s;ame proportion admirable. The tempe&s;t who&s;e rage &s;he could not appea&s;e, &s;he never controuled;&mdash;when|ever, therefore, &s;he perceived the &s;torm bearing hard on the tender &s;pirits of lady Stuart, &s;he drew her imperceptibly, on &s;ome pretence or other, into the &s;helter of another
<PB N="125" REF="133">apartment; and that Sir Gui&s;e might not be more furious, wanting an object whereon to wreak his vengeance, which is always the la&s;t aggravation of &s;uch a temper, &s;he re|turned in ha&s;te, and u&s;ually remained till the violence abated; when, like the angel of mediation, &s;he ha&s;tened to comfort her trem|bling mother. To the&s;e ordeals of Caroline, was Henry often witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet was this contemptible tyrant what a certain divi&s;ion of &s;ociety calls a plea&s;ant companionable man, who could be gay, flexi|ble, and almo&s;t forget his nature in general company. It was only at home that he fol|lowed tho&s;e baneful and malignant impul&s;es, which, like ob&s;tructed torrents, are the more overwhelming for being repre&s;&s;ed. "The mo&s;t abhorred thing in nature," &s;ays a pro|found writer, with the mo&s;t penetrating truth, "is the face that &s;miles abroad, and fla&s;hes fury when it returns to the lap of a tender, helple&s;s, family:" Such was Sir Gui&s;e Lorrain Stuart.</P>
<P>In one of his mo&s;t &s;tormy ebullitions of pa&s;&s;ion, accompanied, as they always were,
<PB N="126" REF="134">when he dared to vent them, with the loude&s;t vociferations, his terror-&s;tricken wife &s;unk &s;ubdued at his foot, which, with exa&s;perating in&s;ult, he rai&s;ed to &s;purn her. "God!" cried lady Stuart, "he will kill me!" Caro|line, who perceived the de&s;ign, threw her|&s;elf between, and received the blow upon her lovely arm; but in&s;tead of attending to the pain, &s;he extended it to her father, while &s;he rai&s;ed and &s;upported lady Stuart with the other, then ki&s;&s;ing the face of her mother, and pre&s;&s;ing the half-reluctant hand of her father to her lips until &s;he had drawn it, in|&s;en&s;ibly, to tho&s;e of his wife, &s;he held it there until it had received a token of for|givene&s;s, to which it was no way entitled. But this failing to effect her purpo&s;e com|pletely, &s;he perceived it was the moment to change her attack, and looking at the brui&s;e of her arm &s;milingly, and in a tone apparent|ly betwixt je&s;t and earne&s;t, &s;aid to it,&mdash;"a fine mark to be &s;ure&mdash;no matter for that! if you were the means of gaining a reconcil|ing ki&s;s from my father, and making him and my mother good friends only for this fort|night
<PB N="127" REF="135">to come, you have my leave to be black and blue the&s;e twenty years!" Then, lift|ing it &s;portingly again to the lips of Sir Gui&s;e, joining his hand at the &s;ame time to that of lady Stuart, now within reach, &s;he exclaim|ed &mdash;"There, Sir, the colours are fixed you &s;ee already, you have &s;poiled me a dozen conque&s;ts, at lea&s;t, at our next ball; but I have gained a victory," drawing her father's arm round his wife's neck, "worth a thou|&s;and of them, and &s;o the beauty of my poor dear arm is much at your di&s;po&s;al, Sir, when|ever you plea&s;e."&mdash;By this time, lady Stuart like a &s;pirit of peace, yet &s;hrinking almo&s;t from her&s;elf, was brought by Caroline into the embrace of Sir Gui&s;e, who, relaxing of his rigour, conde&s;cended with &s;ullen humility to &s;ay, "Madam, I beg your pardon, b&uuml;t you are &s;o cur&s;ed timid and frighted, it always throws me into a pa&s;&s;ion; but this lione&s;s in &s;heep's cloathing, weathers it out you know, let the winds and waves do what they will, and &s;he will have her way, though one were ready to expire with vexation."</P>
<P>Caroline who always knew her opportunity,
<PB N="128" REF="136">&s;aw this was the cri&s;is to gain more, and as her gentle heart was by no means &s;atisfied, &s;ne changed her battery again, and with additional vivacity &s;aid&mdash;"Yes, Sir, but you do not get off &s;o. I have you now"&mdash; tightening her handkerchief in a true-lover's knot, "and I prote&s;t I will not let you &s;tir an inch until you have a&s;ked her lady&s;hip's pardon as you ought to do. Come, Sir, put your hands together prettily, in this manner, for in&s;tance."&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, betwixt contending and yield|ing, &s;uffered her to fold his hands in a pray|ing po&s;ture&mdash;"Well, what non&s;en&s;e next?" cried he, with a &s;oftened kind of growl.</P>
<P>"I vow," added Caroline, "I never &s;aw any thing &s;o well become you, Sir, as good humour.&mdash;Tell me, Madam, is not he quite hand&s;ome when he &s;miles? if you do not reward him for it, you do not de&s;erve it."</P>
<P>Here &s;he playfully put both their faces together, and Sir Gui&s;e was almo&s;t human. The gentle Matilda was pa&s;&s;ive in his arms, but neither in&s;en&s;ible of her hu&s;band's ex|torted
<PB N="129" REF="137">kindne&s;s, nor of her charming Caro|line's generous interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A little &s;tratagem atchieved the re&s;t of her duteous purpo&s;e, and &s;ettled her &s;avage &s;ire this once into unwonted cordiality. "Good gracious!" cried &s;he, dropping on a chair, and from thence on the carpet, "what can be the matter with me? I am certainly going into an hy&s;teric."&mdash;Sir Gui&s;e, taken in his be&s;t humour and by &s;urprize, was on his knees to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, perceiving which, and quitting the part of the &s;ick lady, &s;he bounded up with the lightne&s;s of a &s;ylph, and holding Sir Gui&s;e to his kneeling po&s;ture, declared that was the very attitude in which he ought, for the la&s;t time of a&s;king, to beg lady Stuart to forgive him, which betwixt the plea&s;antry of the &s;ally, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;weetne&s;s of his wife, who involuntarily dropt on her knees, as if a&s;hamed to &s;ee him on his, he did not wholly without grace; after which the triumphant Caroline danced, &s;ung, and tripped round them as if &s;he had completed the conque&s;t of the globe. In the fulne&s;s of her felicity &s;he wept. O Alexander!
<PB N="130" REF="138">what at the un&s;atisfying termination of thy victories, was thy tear to that which fell from the lovely eyes of Caroline Stuart!</P>
<P>At other times when her own efforts mi&s;carried, or met from her father ill-mannered repul&s;e, &s;he would employ the mediation of her brother Charles, who&s;e goodne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition was no more to be warped by undue indulgence, than was that of Caroline by undue &s;everity. Be&s;ides which, Charles Stuart tenderly honoured his mother, and loved his &s;i&s;ter. He was always, there|fore, con&s;idered by Caroline as the <HI>dernier re&s;orte,</HI> in &s;uch family di&s;turbances as baffled her own efforts; and whenever the&s;e heavy &s;torms aro&s;e, &s;he has introduced Charles into the apartment where the tempe&s;t raved, at the exact cri&s;is, &s;ometimes when Sir Gui&s;e thought him out of reach, and more than once when that amiable youth had threatened never to &s;ee his unrelenting father again; nay, &s;ometimes, &s;he has been known to &s;end off a private expre&s;s to him, &s;tating, "that his immediate pre&s;ence could &s;ave his mo|ther from vengeance." On the&s;e occa&s;ion
<PB N="131" REF="139">&s;he would empty her little pur&s;e, to reward the me&s;&s;enger; or when Henry was vi&s;iting at the abbey, during the important impre&s;&s;ive twelve months, &s;he would give him the com|mi&s;&s;ion, which the good-natured youth would execute with incredible &s;peed, and arrive with his friend Charles: the latter no &s;ooner made his appearance than Sir Gui&s;e was charmed, as if by &s;ome magic power that had his &s;avage nature in controul. His violent ec&s;ta&s;ies at &s;eeing his &s;on, and his dread at lo&s;ing him, were &s;o great, that he &s;eldom enquired into the abruptne&s;s of the vi&s;it, but welcomed him with open arms, the more e&s;pecially if Caro|line happened to be by, in the hope &s;o decided a preference might add to her mor|tification; for &s;uch was the radical ba&s;ene&s;s of this man, that even the happine&s;s of his own heart, &s;o far from expanding, contracted it to that of others; and he could pur&s;ue the hateful pa&s;&s;ions of his nature, and remember his aver&s;ions in the mid&s;t of his enjoyments. Little, however, was he &s;killed in the tem|per of his noble-minded daughter. Superior to the ordinary jealou&s;y which &s;uch favouriti&s;m
<PB N="132" REF="140">in parents &s;ometimes excites in children, &s;he &s;ecretly triumphed in her father's predilection for her brother, whom &s;he called the general peace-maker of the family. And as Charles was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic&mdash;&s;he would exert her utmo&s;t &s;kill, and ran&s;ack all her little &s;tores of harmony to detain him at the abbey. She would, moreover, &s;ometimes call in Henry to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her own powers, in order to render her brother's continuance at the abbey more plea&s;ant to him.</P>
<P>But when Charles entered the army, and was ab&s;ent with his regiment in di&s;tant quar|ters, which was at an early period, it was her cu&s;tom to walk her&s;elf to the neighbouring po&s;t-hou&s;e, at the di&s;tance of a &s;hort mile from the abbey, and receive the letters for the family. It was a tender compact between the brother and &s;i&s;ter to make the latter alone the corre&s;pondent of the former, &s;o that &s;he was the medium of all tidings from Charles and Sir Gui&s;e, who, though a general &s;eal-breaker, never had the courage to u&s;e open violence with his &s;on's letters. With one of the&s;e, therefore, &s;he would reward his kind|ne&s;s,
<PB N="133" REF="141">or rather his le&s;s degree of har&s;hne&s;s; for he was never kind to her mother&mdash;with another &s;he would threaten him into better treatment&mdash;with a third bribe&mdash;with a fourth beguile him into &s;omething like civility; and, in &s;hort, by the&s;e and a thou&s;and other inno|cent manoeuvres, &s;he would &s;ometimes abate, &s;ometimes prevent, his anger, and always receive the heavie&s;t weight of it her&s;elf, when to prevent or abate it was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>IF the reader takes into con&s;ideration the youth, &s;u&s;ceptibility, genius, and native &s;oftne&s;s of Henry Fitzorton, he will think the fir&s;t fond emotions of his heart towards this fair object inevitable; and if again he reflects on that young man's amiable endow|ments of mind and per&s;on, he will believe it as unavoidable for him to have had &s;uch almo&s;t con&s;tant intercour&s;e, without her be|coming &s;en&s;ible of his virtues and graces in return. To Caroline, Henry addre&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t in&s;pirations of his infant mu&s;e&mdash;"He

She was the innocent enchantment of his life: he &s;aw her in the magic moments of her grief, and there was little doubt but the fa&s;cination was re|ciprocal; yet a certain delicate terror pre|vented both from declaring what each per|fectly &s;aw, felt, and under&s;tood. The &s;en|&s;ations of Henry were combined of genius, con&s;titutional diffidence, and the &s;weet awe, without fear, that touched him in the pre&s;ence of Caroline. The&s;e bound up his voice as by a &s;pell; and Caroline invariably took re|fuge either in another &s;ubject, or flight, whenever &s;he &s;aw him on the trembling edge of a declaration. And this was &s;o well adju&s;ted on both &s;ides, that no one of the families, not even Charles, had &s;u&s;picion of what was pa&s;&s;ing in their bo&s;oms.

<P>CAROLINE had retreated from the rage of Sir Gui&s;e, on a day that he could not be wrought upon, and when Charles was from home. Her handkerchief was at her eyes, and as &s;he took it from them, &s;he exclaimed, "this la&s;t &s;everity is indeed hard to bear!&mdash;he has almo&s;t beat me to pieces!"</P>
<P>Henry, who had been taking his twilight walk, near the avenue, that led to the abbey, ru&s;hed through the boughs, vociferating, "beat you Caroline! who is the villain that dares lift his hand again&s;t the beloved of my heart and &s;oul? his life &s;hall an&s;wer it! ten thou&s;and lives cannot atone it. In&s;ult you! Beat you! O that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in were here!

The ungovernable wildne&s;s of this &s;peech, the tender phrenzy in which he pre&s;&s;ed her cheek upon his own, without &s;carce knowing that he touched her, increa&s;ed
<PB N="137" REF="145">for a moment the terrors of Caroline; but, on re&s;uming her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid, with penetra|ting firmne&s;s, colouring as &s;he &s;poke, "There is a &s;anctity, &s;ir, in the very infirm|ities of my father, while you are in his daughter's pre&s;ence! and though, in a frail moment, you heard me bewail their effects, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon your a&s;&s;ixing to his name, no epithets unbecoming his child to hear."</P>
<P>Henry was &s;ilenced.</P>
<P>"In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, it was particu|larly un&s;ea&s;onable, &s;ince it was chiefly in de|fence of your honour, &s;ir, that I have &s;uf|fered."</P>
<P>Henry chilled with apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>"You have been accu&s;ed to Sir Gui&s;e, of carrying tales of our little di&s;turbances, from the abbey to the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>The cheeks of Henry &s;eemed to hold all the blood that had filled the channels to his heart.</P>

<P><PB N="138" REF="146">Henry's blood &s;allied back, and left his countenance colourle&s;s as death.</P>

<P>Henry pa&s;&s;ionately caught her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his pale and trembling lips. "You did me indeed but ju&s;tice, Caroline: but was this ju&s;tice repaid by blows?&mdash;O! the honour of my whole life were purcha&s;ed too dear at &s;uch a price."</P>

<P>"But in the end, I triumphed; for a letter that in&s;tant arrived from my brother, replete with honourable te&s;timony of Henry's con|fidential virtues. John Fitzorton, had com|plained to Charles, that though he was regular in his enquiries after Charles, he

<P>"I left my brother's written ju&s;tification in my father's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;aying, as I with|drew, that I &s;hould as &s;oon connect di&s;honour with my own &s;oul, as with that of Henry Fitzorton!"</P>
<P>Henry heard this with a thrill of tran&s;port &s;o univer&s;al, that, unable to contain him&s;elf, he caught Caroline in his arms.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, accompanied by his Lady, came ha&s;tily down the avenue, and &s;urpri&s;ed the lovers in this &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The Baronet &s;hook with a &s;en&s;ation be|tween the exce&s;&s;es of rage and a&s;toni&s;hment; and running up to Caroline, with the dread|ful violence of de&s;perate and uncontroulable authority, would have committed &s;ome out|rage which his life perhaps, mu&s;t have an&s;wered, had not lady Stuart, &s;eeing his fury, thrown her&s;elf on her knees on the bare earth, between her hu&s;band and her child, while Henry &s;pread him&s;elf as a &s;hield before Caroline, a&s;&s;everating in a voice that echoed
<PB N="140" REF="148">through the fore&s;t, "&s;he was the mo&s;t inno|cent and noble creature, now under the eye of an atte&s;ting God!"</P>
<P>Caroline with a mode&s;t intrepidity, ran from her protector, and rai&s;ed her mother from the ground.&mdash;"I cannot bear to &s;ee you in this po&s;ture, madam: it becomes the daughter, not the wife of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart"&mdash; then embracing her father's knees, &s;he entered into an explanation, as to the entire accident of the meeting.</P>
<P>He now heard the whole of Caroline's narration, and either was, or affected to be, &s;atisfied: for with more &s;erenity than could have been expected, he &s;aid, "Mr. Fitzor|ton may be &s;ure I think as well of him as the re&s;t of my family, or &s;hould long &s;ince have for bidden him the abbey. Lady Stuart, indeed, and I, have been this half hour in &s;earch of Caroline, to tell her, I was &s;atisfied the reports made again&s;t you were fal&s;e, though at the time I heard them, they had as bad an a&s;pect as our late di&s;covery, and ju&s;ti|fied as &s;trong &s;u&s;picion; but explanations have done away both, and &s;o if you are not en|gaged
<PB N="141" REF="149">at the ca&s;tle, come and pa&s;s your evening with us at the abbey."</P>
<P>Henry accompanied them home to the infinite &s;atisfaction of him&s;elf and Caroline, and not a little to the comfort of Sir Gui&s;e and his Lady; though it was a comfort &s;pring|ing from very different cau&s;es: and Henry after having &s;aid a number of things in the cour&s;e of the evening, which proved the perfect innocence of him&s;elf and Caroline, but unluckily proved &s;omething more, left his friends and took his way through the fore&s;t by the light of his beloved moon to the Ca&s;tle of Fitzorton. When he came, however, to that part of the great evenue where the adventure that began the evening had happened, he could not but go a little out of his path to revi&s;it the &s;pot, and to do &s;ome act that might mark the aera of the fir&s;t avowed declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion for Caro|line. Favoured, therefore, by the moon, he &s;topt to carve the names of Henry and Caroline, with the dates of the month and year upon the bark of that very tree, under which he had for the fir&s;t time held her in his
<PB N="142" REF="150">arms, while he breathed forth fervours of as cha&s;te a pa&s;&s;ion as ever animated the brea&s;t of man. "Ble&s;&s;ed day," &s;ighed he, "and ble&s;&s;ed be its returns to the end of time!"</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner were the parties at the abbey retired to their &s;eparate chambers, than they gave way to their &s;eparate reflections, each of which, though carried on in a different train, too plainly demon&s;trated, that with|out di&s;puting any part of the facts which Caroline had explained, that very explanation went among&s;t a thou&s;and other matters now fir&s;t made to apply, to place beyond a doubt the long-cheri&s;hed, though long-con|cealed affection of Caroline and Henry. The amiable Lady Stuart &s;ecretly approved the flame, which &s;he neverthele&s;s &s;aw, would if it went on, enwrap the ho&s;tile hou&s;es in a blaze, that in the end would probably reduce both of them to a&s;hes. Sir Gui&s;e groaned in the bitterne&s;s of ill-&s;mothered antipathy, even at the idea of uniting the families of Stuart and Fitzorton, the younge&s;t branch of the latter, being &s;uffered in obedience, &s;trange as may &s;eem the expre&s;&s;ion, to the wi&s;hes
<PB N="143" REF="151">of the &s;on, who, and who alone, had &s;overeign dominion over this impracticable tyrant of a father: and Caroline her&s;elf, when &s;he con|&s;ulted her pillow on the events of the even|ing, and on tho&s;e occurrences which had preceded them, could not but fore&s;ee innu|merable evils ri&s;ing in aweful array before her view. Till this fatal night &s;he had never fully inve&s;tigated the extent of the mi&s;chief which an affection for Henry would inevitably produce. The declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion had made the intere&s;t they took in each other more formidable: it had unbound as it were the charm, which, as a bandeau of love, had by a &s;ort of enchantment covered their eyes from looking too minutely into their hearts. Caroline had &s;o often engaged Henry in the gentle offices of family pacification, made him one of her principal in&s;truments in her little conciliatory plans, re&s;orted to him for council in her dome&s;tic difficulties, and looked upon him &s;o entirely as another Charles, that though &s;he felt his &s;ociety communicated a more intere&s;ting kind of joy, and his ab&s;ence a more lively kind of depri|vation,
<PB N="144" REF="152">&s;he either had not time or inclination, &s;he either did not, or dared not, a&s;k her heart, very &s;eriou&s;ly or formally, "to what a degree Caroline was dear, or to what an extent Henry might be precious." She now, there|fore, for the fir&s;t time, began to rebuke her|&s;elf that the &s;ame motives which had &s;o often impelled her to change Henry's conver&s;ation, break it &s;hort, or leave him abruptly, had not &s;erved as warnings of the &s;tate of both their hearts: and of that &s;orrow which was in re&s;erve for them, if an immediate &s;top were not put to their proceedings.</P>
<P>From accu&s;ations of her&s;elf, &s;he proceeded to accu&s;e Henry, whom &s;he could not think with|out his &s;hare of blame in the&s;e tran&s;actions: "the mi&s;ery we were preparing for our&s;elves, and the wrongs we were heaping on our already but too much outraged hou&s;es. After the la&s;t conte&s;t between them, which termi|nated in the hazard of his brother's life, it was indelicate, it was undutiful in him to approach the abbey:&mdash;and if his affection for Charles was con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the&s;e unhappy feuds, that affection &s;hould have
<PB N="145" REF="153">been carried on at third places, and not clan|de&s;tinely, under a roof where re&s;ided, whe|ther ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly, the known enemy of his father. Scarce had &s;he given vent to the&s;e &s;entiments than her heart brought forth all its &s;oft apologies to excu&s;e, and even to ju&s;tify him. She called to mind the benevo|lent a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had often received from him, when the rage of her father had over|borne her poor <HI>mother</HI> in its vortex, and left <HI>her</HI> undefended in the &s;torm; &s;he had heard too from Charles of the ince&s;&s;ant, though concealed, endeavours of Henry to heal the breach of the contending hou&s;es, till the la&s;t fatal &s;troke made it a <HI>crime</HI> to attempt it farther. In referring the ca&s;e to her own heart &s;he there found his virtues, his tender|ne&s;s, and manly graces, had en&s;hrined him as the fir&s;t of human beings.&mdash;She found him worthy to be its entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and had not an argument remaining again&s;t him but that he was too amiable, and too unfortunate.</P>

<P>IN this di&s;po&s;ition &s;he ro&s;e.

The &s;ecret, therefore, which each &s;uppo&s;ed had been di&s;covered, though each found out the &s;ame fact, only rea&s;oning on it differently, pro|duced a &s;imilar effect on their conduct: nei|ther of them &s;poke to each other for &s;ome time, though each appeared to be labouring with &s;omething extraordinary. The terrors gathered and di&s;per&s;ed on the brow of Sir Gui&s;e; Lady Stuart &s;ometimes &s;urveyed Ca|roline with tender di&s;tre&s;s, that mingled the emotions of pity and apprehen&s;ion; and
<PB N="147" REF="155">Caroline looked aba&s;hed, anxious, and con|founded.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, after the fir&s;t di&s;h of tea, ro&s;e up, &s;trode acro&s;s the room thrice, &s;lapped his hand on his forehead, and &s;tamped with his foot, exclaiming&mdash;"If it be &s;o, woe to them both!"&mdash;then turning to Caroline&mdash;"when the library bell rings it is for you Mi&s;s Stuart."</P>
<P>The trembling Caroline bowed a&s;&s;ent, and Sir Gui&s;e left the room, &s;lapping the door after him with tremendous violence.</P>
<P>"My dear child," &s;aid Lady Stuart, expanding her beautiful arms to receive Caroline, who, on her father's departure, ran into them for &s;helter&mdash;"you are un|happy &mdash;and I fear, too, Sir Gui&s;e has di&s;|covered the cau&s;e.&mdash;If it be that which I think I al&s;o have traced, what will become of us?"</P>
<P>"What, indeed, Madam? for it is&mdash;it can be only that&mdash;my own guilty mind con|vinces me it can be none other," an&s;wered Caroline.</P>
<P>"The guilt of tenderne&s;s for Henry Fitz|orton," re&s;umed her mother, gently care&s;&s;ing
<PB N="148" REF="156">her,&mdash;"Ah! my deare&s;t-loved child, that the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions in the brea&s;t of others &s;hould make the be&s;t in ours criminal!"</P>
<P>Caroline, touched to the quick with this kindne&s;s, an&s;wered only with her tears.&mdash; "Forgive me what I cannot forgive <HI>my&s;elf.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Forgive you!" &s;aid Lady Stuart, "heaven is my witne&s;s, did my power keep pace with my inclination, your tender heart &s;hould never heave a &s;igh that did not proceed from the perfection of its joy. Are you not more than my child? Have you not been more than my parent? How many times has this feeble frame, &s;inking under my hu&s;band's di&s;plea&s;ure, been rai&s;ed from the very du&s;t of the earth by Caroline? How many bitter &s;arca&s;ms has her gentle nature borne for me? How many cruel &s;trokes, intended for me, has that &s;weet form received, and how often have you &s;miled in agony to think they did not reach your mother!"</P>
<P>"Spare, &s;pare me, Madam," &s;aid Caro|line, weeping and clinging round her neck&mdash; "indeed, indeed, my life is of no value, but
<PB N="149" REF="157">as it can be of &s;ome u&s;e, or comfort, to tho&s;e who be&s;towed it."</P>
<P>"Yet do not &s;uppo&s;e," continued Lady Stuart, "I did not feel the blows that you took from me. I felt them in my 'heart of hearts'&mdash;and at this moment could a mother's gratitude, love, or tender adoration, aught avail, the be&s;t of men &s;hould be given, by this maternal hand, to the be&s;t of women&mdash; But, as it is, I tremble for you both."</P>
<P>Here the fatal bell began to &s;ound, and Caroline, who had hid her face in her mother's bo&s;om that her blu&s;hes might not be &s;een during the la&s;t &s;peech, &s;tarted up as if it were the knell of death, and begging her mother to be compo&s;ed, and depend upon Caroline's duty, obeyed the &s;ummons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE library was at the farther-mo&s;t part of the abbey, and the long dreary pa&s;|&s;ages that led to it, with the echo that at|tended every &s;tep, together with the rebound
<PB N="150" REF="158">of the ma&s;&s;y doors as &s;he opened and &s;hut them, gave a &s;olemnity to the &s;cene &s;he was approaching: She came, at length, to the apartment, which &s;he no &s;ooner entered than &s;he threw her&s;elf at the feet of Sir Gui&s;e, who had collected all the <HI>terrors of his di&s;po&s;i|tion</HI> to receive her. Oft he circled the room which, even at mid-day, was always &s;om|brous, and even &s;epulcharl; oft he threw a glare of malignant di&s;dain towards her, &s;till &s;uffering her to keep her lowly po&s;ture. He dropt a curtain &s;o as &s;carcely to admit the entrance of the light&mdash;then fa&s;tened the door. &mdash;His cruel nature never omitted giving to every puni&s;hment its pageantry and apparatus to make it the more terrifying.&mdash;At length, with a voice that was the more dreadful for being controuled, he &s;aid&mdash;"Audacious! you are beloved by the &s;on of my bittere&s;t enemy!"</P>
<P>Caroline bowed her head.</P>
<P>"This is not the wor&s;t," continued he, "you return his pa&s;&s;ion!"</P>
<P>Caroline was &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="159">"Mark me," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, "forbid him the abbey, and let the act &s;eem to be your own."</P>
<P>Caroline bowed a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>"Frame &s;ome fit rea&s;on to your brother for your conduct, and let neither his anger, nor that of your in&s;olent lover, wring from you the &s;ecret that this was by my command."</P>
<P>Caroline bowed again.</P>
<P>"For the pre&s;ent," &s;aid he, "you may withdraw." "Seeing her ri&s;e to obey," he continued,&mdash;"no,&mdash;remain <HI>you</HI> here, while I give orders to your mother, who is to under|&s;tand, remember, it is a &s;ettled point for which you alone are accountable, that <HI>Henry Fitzorton never enters more the Abbey of Stuart."</HI></P>
<P>The da&s;tardy of &s;pirit, which betrayed it&s;elf in the mid&s;t of this hard command, could not but &s;trike the noble-natured Caro|line, and &s;he beheld the &s;hrinking coward dre&s;&s;ed in the robe of the tyrant: <HI>that</HI> tyrant, however, was her father, and &s;he had made it the law of her life to obey him. After Sir
<PB N="152" REF="160">Gui&s;e had left the room &s;he remained for &s;ome moments without motion&mdash;then fetching a deep &s;igh &s;he exclaimed&mdash;the tears almo&s;t choaking her utterance&mdash;"This is the harde&s;t duty ever yet impo&s;ed on me: Enable me, good heaven, to bear it!&mdash;and is Caroline to let him under&s;tand, it is &s;he who <HI>&s;huts the door</HI> again&s;t him for ever! Mu&s;t I appear cruel, and unju&s;t, in order to be obedient? How &s;hall I endure it! And have I &s;een for the la&s;t time Henry Fitzorton. O! it is too much!"</P>
<P>There was, however, as we have already ob&s;erved, a fortitude in the mind of this amiable girl which equalled the tenderne&s;s of her heart, and on this great occa&s;ion &s;he re|&s;olved to &s;ummon it to her aid. Nothing but the ruin of her&s;elf, and the ruin of the object &s;he loved, and, probably, the utter de&s;truction of both the hou&s;es, could, &s;he fore&s;aw, be the con&s;equence, if &s;he li&s;tened to any arguments that pleaded in her bo&s;om in favour of this unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and &s;he &s;oon per&s;uaded her&s;elf it would be a me|ritorious &s;acrifice to cru&s;h it at once. She,
<PB N="153" REF="161">therefore, began, &s;eriou&s;ly, to con&s;ider how this might be&s;t, and mo&s;t effectually be done; not a little felicitating her&s;elf that as Henry was now gone home, &s;he &s;hould have time to devi&s;e means proportioned to the end. While &s;he was ruminating on the&s;e matters the library folding-doors were again thrown. open,&mdash;Sir Gui&s;e re-entered&mdash;&s;tood fixed an in&s;tant&mdash;turned back&mdash;and beckoned her to follow him. They pa&s;&s;ed along the winding labyrinths, and cloi&s;ter-like glooms, without &s;peaking a word; and as they came within view of the room to which he was guiding her, he &s;aid, in a firm but fearful kind of whi&s;per&mdash;"That is the apartment&mdash; and this the opportunity&mdash;<HI>obedience of death!</HI>" then abruptly leaving her, he &s;trode back towards the library. The handle of the door &s;hook as &s;he opened it, without knowing what &s;he had to apprehend: but what was her a&s;toni&s;hment when &s;he &s;aw Henry Fitz|orton, &s;itting with Lady Stuart, half drowned in her tears! Caroline had not time or power to articulate her &s;urprize, before her mother ro&s;e, as &s;he had been previou&s;ly commanded,
<PB N="154" REF="162">and looking unutterable tenderne&s;s, fir&s;t at Caroline, then at Henry, left the room.&mdash;On Caroline's following her &s;he gently repul&s;ed her&mdash;&s;hook her head, and &s;hewed every &s;ign of dumb di&s;tre&s;s as &s;he withdrew.</P>
<P>She now found her&s;elf alone with the <HI>very</HI> Henry &s;he thought never to &s;ee more. It was a prophetic pau&s;e on both &s;ides. Henry fir&s;t broke &s;ilence by informing her, that he could not re&s;t in peace till he found the reconciliation of the pa&s;t night were confirmed: but that from the pre&s;ent air of Sir Gui&s;e, and the unexplained anxiety of Lady Stuart, he had fears that &s;ome new commotion had happened, and begged earne&s;tly to know if he could any way be made in&s;trumental to re&s;tore the quiet of the family.</P>
<P>"You can, and you only," an&s;wered Caroline. "You, ye&s;terday, declared your love, and to-day I renounce, what, alas! I could not accept without complicated injury and inju&s;tice. We have erred; let us reform that errour: but, as the ta&s;k may be more difficult while we are in the pre&s;ence of each
<PB N="155" REF="163">other, it is a duty&mdash;perhaps a hard one&mdash;but &s;till a duty that we owe each other&mdash;and, certainly, that we owe our unhappily divided hou&s;es, to meet no more."&mdash;It was &s;ome minutes before &s;he could utter the la&s;t &s;entence!</P>
<P>Perceiving, as &s;he &s;aid this, that Henry was about to combat all her arguments, and knowing how powerful an advocate in his favour &s;he nouri&s;hed in her own bo&s;om, &s;he anticipated, and annihilated, whatever he could have advanced by this deci&s;ive &s;en|tence. &mdash;"I have &s;poken on <HI>conviction</HI> Henry, and my actions mu&s;t accord with my words."</P>
<P>Having delivered her&s;elf thus, with an unu&s;ual degree of &s;olemnity, &s;he advanced towards Henry, gave him her hand in a manner that at once expre&s;&s;ed tenderne&s;s and re&s;olution, and with a voice in uni&s;on with the&s;e, exclaimed, "my dear, my excellent Henry, may the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven follow you as uncea&s;ingly as my regard!"</P>
<P>The agitated Henry wanted courage to relea&s;e her hand, or to retain it.&mdash;His own trembled in it&mdash;the unutterable angui&s;h of
<PB N="156" REF="164">&s;uch a parting was painted in his looks as he &s;urveyed tho&s;e of Caroline, who perceiving his &s;ituation, and, perhaps, feeling her own would, in the next in&s;tant, be &s;imilar, by one powerful effort&mdash;as the tears were &s;tealing unbidden down her lovely face&mdash;as her colour began to vary, and her limbs to fail&mdash;firmly, but not rudely, broke from his hands, and ru&s;hed out of the apartment.</P>
<P>In her way back to the library &s;he met Sir Gui&s;e, to whom with re&s;umed force, for pre|&s;ence of mind was among&s;t her extraordinary powers, &s;he &s;aid, "you ARE obeyed my father&mdash;&s;uffer me now to enjoy the victory over my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Meeting no interruption from Sir Gui&s;e &s;he &s;ought her chamber, while her father went into the apartment &s;he had ju&s;t left, in order to enjoy a victory of another kind. On his entrance he found Henry overwhelmed in his grief and de&s;pair, and apologized to him, on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s, for having left the room &s;o abruptly: while Henry,&mdash;&s;o in|finitely do circum&s;tances change the objects of fear to hope, and hope to fear,&mdash;&s;oftened
<PB N="157" REF="165">his de&s;peration by a thought that an enemy might be converted into a friend; his agi|tated heart believed it po&s;&s;ible that the father, in his pitying goodne&s;s, would intercede with the daughter, to relax &s;o much of her cruel re&s;olution, as to &s;uffer his vi&s;its at the abbey as a friend.</P>
<P>Had Sir Gui&s;e &s;haped an event to his wi&s;h it could not have been more au&s;picious than this to his purpo&s;e; for every pang he in|flicted on any individual of the Fitzorton family, &s;o as he e&s;caped the danger of di&s;|covering that he was the inflictor, gratified that revenge he felt for the whole. He now, therefore, began to &s;ing forth the prai&s;es of his own friendly wi&s;hes on the occa&s;ion; de|claring how infinitely he was a&s;toni&s;hed, fir&s;t at the affection it&s;elf, and &s;econdly, at the girl's &s;o ab&s;olute rejection of him. "However I will do my be&s;t, and hope I may &s;ucceed," added he, "and if you fail the fault will not lie with me." Sir Gui&s;e &s;hook him by the hand, advi&s;ed him to &s;u&s;pend his vi&s;its for a few days, that he might have the better op|portunity to befriend his cau&s;e, and &s;miled
<PB N="158" REF="166">as he bade him farewell. Henry, who be|lieved that every &s;mile and promi&s;e was &s;incere, left the abbey much con&s;oled.</P>

<P>WHILE the&s;e matters were carrying on in the family of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, tran&s;|actions no le&s;s intere&s;ting, but of a very dif|ferent nature, had happened at the ca&s;tle. For a con&s;iderable time after the fe&s;tivities, on the birth-day of Olivia, the hou&s;es of Fitz|orton and Clare, were in that &s;tate of hap|pine&s;s, which, in good minds, generally are in the train of reconciliations. John had more than one cau&s;e of hoarded regret, but he had learned early to &s;acrifice; and although Henry yet carried, like the wounded deer, an arrow in his bo&s;om, which often &s;eparated him from the &s;ocial circle, he &s;till nouri&s;hed the hope of a cure al&s;o, and waited in &s;ecret an opportunity to explain. Meanwhile his flights, and his reveries, were variou&s;ly ac|counted for, defended by Olivia, bantered by John, and pardoned by all.</P>

<P>"Well &s;aid philo&s;opher!" ob&s;erved Sir Armine, "I pre&s;ume you have been reading what a mitred author of our own country, di&s;tingui&s;hed as well for profound as elegant literature,&mdash;&s;o you &s;ee 'tis very po&s;&s;ible to

<P>"True, Sir," an&s;wered John, "on the &s;ame reverend authority, I am di&s;po&s;ed to admit yet more," here he looked keenly at Henry, "a young and credulous imagination loves to admire and be deceived, and has no need to ob&s;erve tho&s;e cautious rules of credibility &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be followed by him, who would touch the affections, and intere&s;t the heart."</P>
<P>"You have twi&s;ted and applied this to your own purpo&s;e John," &s;aid his father.&mdash; "It is in addre&s;&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ions that poetical truth is &s;aid to be 'almo&s;t as &s;evere a thing as hi&s;torical." "Di&s;tingui&s;h, dear brother, if
<PB N="163" REF="171">you plea&s;e, betwixt a dauber and an arti&s;t," &s;aid Henry&mdash;"The &s;terling and the dro&s;s," added Olivia&mdash;"A contemptible copyi&s;t and a noble imitator," remarked Sir Armine&mdash; "The weak attempts of a few from general excellence," noted Lady Fitzorton&mdash;"Rather &s;ay, Madam, the excellence of a few," an|&s;wered John, "and the weak attempts, to call them no wor&s;e, of many: for Apollo, and my brother, who I am ready to admit it, are not <HI>wholly</HI> unknown to each other, will tell you that genius is rare, and pretenders to it general." Olivia declared, &s;milingly, "the philo&s;opher had here made rather a &s;en&s;ible remark."&mdash;"Why, in truth," &s;aid Sir Armine, "it mu&s;t be owned that there is a pretty deal of literary juggling now a days."&mdash; "Hocus Pocus, my dear father," interrupted John, "you had better call it; and it has now gained &s;uch an influence over the public ta&s;te, that, thanks to noveli&s;ts and poets; nay, no frowning Olivia." "He has made &s;ome|thing like an exception in Henry's ca&s;e," &s;aid Lady Fitzorton&mdash;"O, as to that my lady," re&s;umed John, "if my brother has any
<PB N="164" REF="172">thoughts of appearing beyond this &s;miling circle as an author, he mu&s;t, more or le&s;s, give into the ab&s;urdity of the times&mdash;for a writer can no more be out of the fa&s;hion of the moment than a beauty." "You only mean, I pre&s;ume," ob&s;erved Sir Armine, "that a little of the art magic is a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in modern compo&s;ition&mdash;e&s;pecially in the two branches of writing you have &s;pecified."</P>
<P>"Art magic, with a vengeance!" ex|claimed John, "for I ob&s;erve the ladies and gentlemen of the quill, can fill the pur&s;es with gold,"&mdash;"On mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted prin|ciples, certainly; for they &s;eldom fill their own," cried Mr. Clare;&mdash;"and croud the pocket with bank bills," continued John, not heeding the interruption, "without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e, or, indeed, a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on for their conjuration and coining, &s;ave that having brought the favourite per&s;onages of their poems, or romance, into &s;ome dreadful &s;crape, to excite your commi&s;eration, they find it expedient to work a miracle in their behalf, finding nothing &s;hort of a miracle
<PB N="165" REF="173">will extricate them; and thus to effect the double aim of entrapping wonder, and leav|ing the my&s;tery ju&s;t where it was; but what I chiefly admire in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and more par|ticularly on the &s;tage, is the dexterity and fore&s;ight with which a poet equips his heroes and heroines, with money or bills, exactly proportioned to their unexpected contin|gencies. If a hero or heroine walk forth in a night-gown or &s;lippers, and meet with an object, on which to exerci&s;e his or her grandeur of &s;oul, the pur&s;e, or pocket-book, is as well furni&s;hed for the occa&s;ion, as if he or &s;he were going to the world's end in &s;earch of any &s;uch object; or if heroes them&s;elves want money, the provident poet always &s;ends &s;omebody to accommodate them; and as to how this matter was brought about, is left to exerci&s;e the reader's faith and &s;agacity. And, indeed, the writer's practi&s;e herein is not a little politic; for to develope the miracle, would be far more arduous than to perform it. It is all done by tho&s;e magicians, in the true &s;pirit, as I termed it, of hocus-pocus, is it not, brother? And yet by an operation
<PB N="166" REF="174">&s;o &s;imple, that the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and truly unaccountable revolutions, &s;uch as in the ordinary cour&s;e of things might take nature ab&s;olute the progre&s;&s;ive toil of ages, are atchieved by the waving of a feather. And albeit, we all know, this feather grew on the wing of a bird, by no means miraculou&s;ly gifted, nor in any degree popular for the brilliancy of its intellect; we mu&s;t not mea|&s;ure the power of the in&s;trument with the weakne&s;s or &s;implicity of the agent; for by the necromantic potency of that little rod, more miracles are performed than by that of the patriarch, yea, and without the &s;malle&s;t in&s;piration derived from the &s;ame divine &s;ource." "Brother," interpo&s;ed Henry, who now &s;ummoned his defen&s;ive powers, "have you never repo&s;ed in any of tho&s;e bowers of ea&s;e, palaces of plea&s;ure, and temples of devotion, which the literary magi of gothic, yea, and &s;ometimes of modern days, have commanded to ari&s;e for your admiration out of their creative fancy? Au&s;tere as are your judgments, &s;evere as are, indeed, many of your delights, have you never been led into
<PB N="167" REF="175">willing relaxations of all the &s;ublime, but un&s;miling powers, by the enchantment of that feathery wand you hold &s;o much in &s;corn?" "In &s;corn! O, pardon me!" rejoined John Fitzorton: "Although, peradventure, the &s;illy bird, on who&s;e wing it grew, will drop it as &s;he grazes on the green, uncon&s;cious of what &s;he throws away, I bow to it as to a new wonder, added to the old ones of our world. Imperial goo&s;e-quills, all hail! with one of the&s;e has a valley been &s;welled to a mountain; a mountain &s;unk to a valley; with another a &s;avage fore&s;t has been converted into a well-ordered city; and a city again turned into a fore&s;t; by a third, has the mul|titudinous &s;ea been dried up, and flocks, ready made, and ready &s;horn, ordered to cover its once pearl-paved, now flower-ena|melled, bottom. It is all done, indeed, in as &s;hort a &s;pace, and, perhaps, with yet le&s;s labour than it has co&s;t me, poor &s;ublunary crawling creature, to inform this fair com|pany that &s;uch miracles have been, and con|tinue to be, performed daily.&mdash;But, alas!" added John, after a pau&s;e, "I am in &s;hort,
<PB N="168" REF="176">&s;o &s;tupid, that although I am aware the &s;light|e&s;t fabricator of the &s;lighte&s;t romance you may have in your library, my dear Henry, would have charms upon charms for your fine feeling &s;u&s;ceptible hearted tribe, I have more &s;atisfaction in the tricks of a kitten, or monkey, becau&s;e their antics are more en|tertaining, and a great deal more natural."</P>

<P>HERE lady Fitzorton &s;aid to Henry, "But the godde&s;s is not &s;o partial to him, is &s;he my dear poet?"&mdash;"No, that is &s;he not," rejoined Olivia, "not by ten thou&s;and degrees; and I thank heaven, I am not &s;o formidably wi&s;e, and tremendou&s;ly &s;en&s;ical as our philo&s;opher." The latter part of her &s;entence was half &s;unk in a whi&s;per, addre&s;&s;ed to her father, while &s;he &s;poke at John and looked at Henry. "Now that," cried John, in turn &s;peaking at Olivia, and looking at his brother James, who had hitherto taken no part in the conver&s;ation, "that puts me in mind of another great &s;ecret in nature poetic,
<PB N="169" REF="177">and dramatic, wholly di&s;tinct from nature ab&s;olute; in other words, the nature which is the godde&s;s of Henry's bards and romances, and &s;he who pre&s;ides as the tutelary deity of my monkeys and kittens. You have adopt|ed, my &s;weet Olivia, the &s;tage whi&s;per, I perceive, of the fine effect of which I am tremendou&s;ly &s;en&s;ical, and formidably wi&s;e enough to be not a little amu&s;ed by, when|ever I over-hear it." Olivia blu&s;hed.&mdash;John perceived the colour he had rai&s;ed, and it found a &s;ympathy in his cheek. "My re|mark was made &s;portingly, &s;o far as it re&s;pected you, dear Olivia," &s;aid John, kindly taking her hand, "nor am I, in this matter, out of humour with the dramati&s;ts&mdash;for who|ever makes me laugh when he has been try|ing to make me weep is my benefactor, ina&s;|much as I love to laugh, and hate whimper|ing; but to be &s;ure the&s;e &s;tage whi&s;perings are &s;omewhat curiou&s;ly managed. The bard, indeed, as my tuneful brother knows, takes as many liberties with the ears as with the eyes. He never intends his whi&s;pering cha|racters &s;hould conceal their &s;ecrets&mdash;even &s;hould they be Family Secrets,&mdash;from the
<PB N="170" REF="178">audience, to whom they are often more com|municative than could be wi&s;hed."</P>
<P>But although the audience may hear, the actors may not: this is a &s;ettled point; if, for in&s;tance, three per&s;ons are engaged in the &s;cene at the &s;ame time, a lady and her two lovers, the latter we will &s;uppo&s;e are rivals; there is nothing, I have ob&s;erved, more com|mon than for the lady &s;tanding equally di&s;tant from both the gentlemen, to a&s;&s;ure him whom &s;he mo&s;t favours, of her eternal affec|tion for him, and of her as eternal aver&s;ion to the other, in a &s;tage whi&s;per, or what is technically called an&mdash;<HI>a&s;ide,</HI> not a &s;yllable of which reaches the ears of the man &s;he hates, although her declaration mounts to the la&s;t row of the upper-gallery, and puts every 'unwa&s;hed artificer' &s;itting there in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lady's &s;ecret. But that the dramatic probability, &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by the critics, may not herein be thought to be too gro&s;sly violated, I beg to remind them of that well-known philo&s;ophical truth, that fire is a body which, by its own nature, a&s;cends; and in &s;tage affairs it may mount
<PB N="171" REF="179">with &s;uch convenient velocity, that, like a &s;troke of lightning, it may &s;eize one per&s;on by the ears, and be fini&s;hing its commi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame way upon the ears of another, at many miles' di&s;tance, without &s;o much as &s;ingeing the curls of tho&s;e who may hap|pen to be in company with the per&s;on fir&s;t &s;truck. For my own part, this way of ac|counting for it is very &s;atisfactory. Perhaps the lover, who &s;tands on one &s;ide of the lady, as well as he who &s;tands on the other, would, in the very pro&s;e of truth, hear al&s;o, and &s;ome|what more di&s;tinctly than the audience, con|&s;idering the difference of &s;pace betwixt the &s;peakers and hearers, were it not nece&s;&s;ary to pre-&s;uppo&s;e&mdash;countle&s;s are the things to be pre-&s;uppo&s;ed in poetry, you know, Henry,&mdash; a &s;ort of partial dea&s;ne&s;s in &s;uch of the cha|racters as ought not to hear, our imagina|tions at the &s;ame time throwing wide open the ears of tho&s;e who ought."</P>
<P>"Son, John," &s;aid Sir Armine, "you &s;hould con&s;ider that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama, like that of life, cannot be carried on with|out &s;ometimes putting in practice a temporary
<PB N="172" REF="180">&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the faculties, both of ears and eyes. Upon that great &s;tage, the &s;tage of the world," continued Sir Armine, "we are obliged to &s;eem deprived of half our &s;en&s;es, in order to pre&s;erve any &s;hare of our good humour:&mdash;nay, we are frequently reduced to &s;eem both deaf and blind to certain incon|&s;i&s;tencies in others or in our&s;elves; and few are tho&s;e who have not been under a nece&s;&s;ity of turning the apparently deaf ear, and the blind eye, on our own conduct, or on that of our neighbours. Perhaps the chief fault of the literary magi is their violation of all pro|bability, which is ever a &s;ource of di&s;gu&s;t to the reader, except in an Arabian tale, or any other work of plea&s;ant impo&s;&s;ibilities; the delight of peru&s;ing which ari&s;es wholly from ob&s;erving to what an extent the human fancy may go, even while we know it has over|leapt the bounds of human affairs, without receiving a check on the delight we take in the&s;e well-con&s;tructed, though avowed fictions, from the human under&s;tanding; but in a compo&s;ition that is offered to us, as a faithful copy of nature and life, the&s;e extravagancies
<PB N="173" REF="181">produce a very contrary effect; and therein I have too often ju&s;t cau&s;e to enter a &s;erious prote&s;t again&s;t modern poetry and romance."</P>

<P>"I REMEMBER a certain literary friend of mine," &s;aid John, ca&s;ting a &s;ort of iden|tifying glance at his brother Henry, "who, in a little narrative which then employed his pen, had occa&s;ion for &s;ome hawthorn bu&s;hes to hide a pair of true <HI>loveyers</HI> from a cro&s;s old grandmother who oppo&s;ed their flame&mdash; Well, the&s;e hawthorn bu&s;hes&mdash;I forget, Henry, whether they were in blo&s;&s;om, but I dare &s;ay they were&mdash;the&s;e full blo&s;&s;oming hawthorns then were exce&s;&s;ively convenient, and very pretty; but, as in the preceding page, we had been on a barren heath, where nothing but the furze and thi&s;tle could bloom, and we had not &s;hifted ground, I could not help remarking, that I pre&s;umed the &s;cene of his &s;tory was in fairy land, and the&s;e &s;ame bu&s;hes brought and popt down in the very place they were wanted, by a fairy,
<PB N="174" REF="182">one of the bard's familiars, invi&s;ible to all but the poets to whom they appertain."</P>
<P>Some indignant flu&s;hings pa&s;&s;ed over Henry's countenance, but tarried not.</P>
<P>"And had the&s;e flowering &s;hrubs been tran&s;|planted from the garden of a rich, and if you will permit the term, a fragrant imagination&mdash; than which, properly cultured, there is no|thing more blooming, nothing more beauti|ful," ob&s;erved Sir Armine, regarding his &s;on Henry with a &s;mile, which was repaid to the father by two from Olivia,&mdash;"they might appear very properly placed, and give &s;weet|ne&s;s to the tale." "Undoubtedly, Sir," re|plied John, "I know very well that mo&s;t grave and potent biographers, &s;uddenly force into their &s;ervice, much more difficult mat|ters than a few hawthorn bu&s;hes, and the be&s;t authorities may be found in &s;upport of the practice, if my brother Henry choo&s;es to &s;helter him&s;elf under them."</P>
<P>"What, they were Henry's hawthorns, were they?" que&s;tioned his mother. "Then I am &s;ure they mu&s;t be natural and charm|ing," &s;aid Olivia.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="183">"You do not &s;ufficiently allow for poetic licen&s;e, perhaps, John," remarked his father. "O yes," rejoined John, &s;inking his &s;everity in &s;portive tones and ob&s;ervations, not, how|ever, without &s;ome ju&s;t acumen, "I have &s;poken with all imaginable re&s;pect to the poet's licence, which many have thought ex|tends to the rai&s;ing an oak from an acorn in a moment; and, what I take to be as arduous, changing the &s;exes &s;o entirely by the &s;light aid of petticoat on the gentleman, and breeches on the lady, that although not &s;o much as a gauze veil is thrown over their faces&mdash;note here that I mean a gauze cover|ing, in all acceptations of the word, actually and intellectually&mdash;nor any attempt at con|cealment, or di&s;gui&s;e in their voices, they are as effectually guarded from ob&s;ervation, as was the blue-eyed godde&s;s when &s;he de|&s;cended to the angry &s;on of Thetis in a cloudy chariot. The necromancers in literature," continued John Fitzorton, &s;miling, "per|form nightly miracles upon the modern &s;tage without any intervention or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the godde&s;s of wi&s;dom. There, by
<PB N="176" REF="184">the &s;imple transfer of dre&s;&s;es, the per&s;ons wearing them are &s;hrouded &s;o, that their mo&s;t intimate friends and their neare&s;t relations cannot find them out: lovers, con&s;umed with the tender pa&s;&s;ion, about which they have di&s;cour&s;ed at large, in their natural characters, the very act or &s;cene before this their meta|morpho&s;is, it is pre-determined are not to know one another. Now as this mighty magic is done on a public &s;tage, it is to be taken for granted, that there is really and truly &s;ome necromancy about it, which our dulne&s;s does not enable us to account for, and that the &s;pectators, who not only accommo|date to, but appear frequently delighted with it, are virtually &s;o charmed, that all theit &s;en&s;es are, for the time being, ab&s;olutely and mo&s;t conveniently thrown by the poet into a mo&s;t poetical trance."</P>
<P>"This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed," exclaim|ed Henry, with &s;ome warmth, and a little a&s;perity, "not only out-Herods Herod, but out-Ovids Ovid, and is drawn in di&s;|temper, after my brother John's caricature manner; but as I pretend to no &s;uch &s;uper|natural
<PB N="177" REF="185">powers, I mu&s;t deny every impotent attempt at &s;uch marvellous atchievements." &mdash; "What &s;ay you, &s;on James, to all this?" que&s;tioned Sir Armine, &mdash; "You know, Sir," he an&s;wered, "my con&s;tant quarrel with all exce&s;&s;es&mdash;and the principal fault I have to alledge again&s;t novel-writing, and their read|ers, is their over de&s;ire to &s;urpri&s;e, and to be &s;urpri&s;ed, by enormous events and gigantic atchievements, above the &s;ize of any inci|dents I have ever yet been able to &s;ee in nature; and which, were any &s;uch di&s;cover|able in life, I &s;hould turn from them, after the indulgence of a kind of fearful curio&s;ity, with the di&s;gu&s;t or &s;atiety that follows our &s;urvey of all mon&s;ters. Now, in compo&s;i|tion, this pa&s;&s;ion for the grand and marvel|lous, has &s;hut the &s;en&s;es of dealers in that way, whether writers, or readers, again&s;t what, as oppo&s;ed to their mighty magic, may be termed the minute and natural; by which I only mean &s;uch objects as, bearing due proportion to humanity, may be &s;een or felt continually; or, even if they do not come
<PB N="178" REF="186">within our own notice, the repre&s;entation of them &s;trikes us, as a faithful copy of what may rea&s;onably be felt or &s;een by mortal be|ings in &s;imilar circum&s;tances.&mdash;In my opi|nion, the three ve&s;&s;els is a drawing that applies to literary as well as moral geography, and I cannot be laughed out of it.</P>
<P>"In a word, Sir, I am a friend to due proportions, which are, I think, of the middle &s;ize, avoiding either extreme of pain|fully high, or in&s;ignificantly low: the giants and hobgoblins of the pre&s;s, are as little to my ta&s;te as its dwarfs and pigmies.

<P>IN this manner would the Fitzortons and Clares con&s;ole their griefs, correct their judgments, a&s;&s;ert their intellectual inde|pendency, or improve their moral happine&s;s; but Henry and John had, as we have ob|&s;erved, each &s;ubjects nearer to their &s;ouls than any thing that attaches to the pur&s;uits of &s;cience. That of the former is already be|fore the reader, and the themes which too often employed the contemplations of John, were of a nature &s;o heavy to his thought, and &s;o unyielding even to his di&s;cipline, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to call in the active pro|fe&s;&s;ion of arms, in aid of a &s;trong, yet in|competent philo&s;ophy. In the colli&s;ion of opinion, the mind is &s;eized upon, and warmed by &s;econdary objects, and its primary emo|tions are awhile &s;u&s;pended; but, faithful to the&s;e, &s;he flies back to her ma&s;ter-pa&s;&s;ion: even when replete with woe; and although &s;he again finds it nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, to force her&s;elf into oppo&s;ite trains of re&s;lection, or
<PB N="180" REF="188">of employment; many are the returns, and many the de&s;ertions, ere that grand and ble&s;&s;ed de&s;ideratum in morality&mdash;an ea&s;y government of the heart and its pa&s;&s;ions, can be attained.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, James continued the plain and even track of his profe&s;&s;ion, and was, on his own account, the lea&s;t annoyed by care.&mdash; Even in his temper, regular in the exertion of his talents, and undeviating in his pur&s;uits, he followed the path he had cho&s;en, without any other ambition than that of being di&s;|tingui&s;hed as a man of &s;ound principles, &s;ound under&s;tanding, and a &s;ound lawyer&mdash;the ho|nourable points towards which he found him&s;elf quietly advance. His vacations, whether of days or weeks, were pa&s;t at the ca&s;tle, where he entered literally into all that cencerned his family or his friends; now &s;ettled a difference, and now &s;trengthened an agreement; and although both John and Henry retained their own &s;entiments, after they had con&s;ulted him, each had &s;o good an opinion of his fairne&s;s in judgement, and
<PB N="181" REF="189">candour in deci&s;ion, that when Sir Armine delivered them over to them&s;elves, declaring they mu&s;t e'en battle it out, they &s;ometimes &s;uffered the di&s;puted point to &s;tand over until James &s;hould come down.</P>
<P>But, alas! there were &s;everal important points which neither Henry nor John could &s;ubmit to the arbitration, even of a tender brother, and which, indeed, they &s;carcely dared whi&s;per to their own minds. The la&s;t affray betwixt Sir Armine and Sir Gui&s;e, and the filial piety of John on that occa&s;ion, had &s;o widened the family breach, that there &s;eemed no way, con&s;i&s;tent with Henry's duty, either to become an advocate for Sir Gui&s;e, or to carry on a corre&s;pondence with his &s;on. Neverthele&s;s, a more active power even than his general benevolence, or than his particu|lar friend&s;hip&mdash;his love of Caroline, em|boldened him to attempt both the&s;e arduous points. His efforts, however, to conciliate, produced from his father the fir&s;t frown he had ever received from him; and under the mi&s;ery of this, he langui&s;hed until he had made atonement by a &s;olemn promi&s;e, never
<PB N="182" REF="190">to mention Sir Gui&s;e Stuart in the pre&s;ence of Sir Armine, until permitted by the latter.</P>
<P>Olivia happened to be pre&s;ent at the mo|ment of his father's di&s;plea&s;ure; and Henry had ob&s;erved her &s;ympathizing tears de&s;cend, as &s;he &s;aw the open brow of Sir Armine contract. Tho&s;e tears fell like the dews of heaven upon his anger, and melted away the frown. "Behold," &s;aid &s;he, to Henry, "your good father has the &s;weete&s;t &s;mile on his countenance you ever &s;aw; it would grace the brow of the angel of forgivene&s;s." Then approaching Sir Armine, with Henry in her hand, &s;he exclaimed&mdash;"His fir&s;t offence will receive your full pardon, Sir, when you con|&s;ider, there has been di&s;covered in it, more virtue than we can find in mo&s;t other people's be&s;t actions." This, though it produced an embrace from Sir Armine, was a fre&s;h blow to Henry, who knew there was le&s;s virtue in his interce&s;&s;ions for the Gui&s;e family, than in mo&s;t of the other actions of his life, unle&s;s it be among tho&s;e cardinal virtues of human nature, which, according to the celebrated Maximi&s;t, "begin and end in &s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="191">Olivia &s;till &s;aw that Henry was at war with him&s;elf, &s;he therefore con&s;idered how &s;he could more perfectly re&s;tore his peace. With this view, getting John into the plot, &s;he took Sir Armine a&s;ide one evening, &s;aying in a &s;educing kind of half-whi&s;per, "&s;he had a boon to prefer;" the Baronet replied, "&s;he &s;hould not a&s;k in vain." They with|drew, and in le&s;s than an hour returned hand in hand in high good humour. Mr. Clare ob&s;erved, "that if &s;he went on in that man|ner, making palpable love to Sir Armine, he &s;hould be jealous;" "and if you, &s;ir, are not jealous," &s;aid James, "methinks my brother Henry will have good rea&s;on to be &s;o, or el&s;e he is all at once grown a very even-tempered youth." Many little pacific &s;allies &s;ucceeded: &s;upper was &s;erved, after which Sir Armine de&s;ired Olivia's toa&s;t; &s;he gave "Charles Stuart;" Henry looked alter|nately at his Father and Olivia. Sir Armine repeated the toa&s;t with an amicable empha&s;is; Henry then filled his gla&s;s, bowing fir&s;t to his Father, then to Olivia, who &s;at in her accu&s;tomed &s;eat at his &s;ide: the bumpers
<PB N="184" REF="192">pa&s;&s;ed round, after which Sir Armine ob|&s;erved, "it had been the opinion of advo|cates Olivia and James, and confirmed by Philo&s;opher John, that the white lambs &s;hould be &s;eparated from the black &s;heep, and that as neither Lady, Charles, nor Caroline Stuart, had at any time, aided or abetted the dome&s;|tic ho&s;tilities, they were no ways contami|nated by their nece&s;&s;ary connections with their offending father;"&mdash;"and as," inter|rupted John, "it has been determined in our family-cabinet to re-in&s;tate Charles at the ca&s;tle"&mdash;"and to allow you, my dear Henry," exclaimed Olivia, "to return his vi&s;its at the abbey." "And I hope," re|&s;umed John, "as I hate talking about it godde&s;s, and about it, or fringing and tin|&s;elling a plain act of ju&s;tice, this will take place without any unnece&s;&s;ary delay."&mdash; "Delay! O heavens, no!" exclaimed Henry, bowing and hurrying off.&mdash;"But deliver this pacquet to your friend," &s;aid John, holding him, "and be &s;ure you tell him I acknowledge him as a brother officer;" "and take notice, my Harry," rejoined his
<PB N="185" REF="193">father, "I am ready to &s;ign the treaty imme|diately." "Very fine," quoth Mr. Clare, "but what have all of you to &s;ay to my girl, who I plainly &s;ee, has coaxed Fitzorton out of all this? don't tell me! it was neither your law James, nor John's philo&s;ophy, no, nor yet Henry's poetry:&mdash;It was my Olivia's magic&mdash;neither youth nor age can with&s;tand her &s;pells. O my con&s;cience! the next ren|contre we hear of, I &s;uppo&s;e will be between Sir Armine and his three &s;ons, contending for my fair daughter!"&mdash;"Ble&s;s me!" &s;aid Olivia, "you make a great piece of work about a trifle. I wi&s;h every hour of my life could add either to the father or the &s;ons &s;ome proof of the gratitude and affection I owe them!"</P>
<P>Henry was fully con&s;cious of the extent of his obligation to Olivia. Not to have been touched with it, only as it had reference to his friend Charles, who&s;e heart was almo&s;t breaking for rea&s;ons better known to Henry than to any of the company, would have placed him among&s;t the mo&s;t ba&s;e of the ungrateful; but when to that con&s;ideration,
<PB N="186" REF="194">is added the circum&s;tance of his hitherto clande&s;tine vi&s;its at the abbey, receiving thence a &s;anction from his father, the &s;en&s;e of what he owed to her kindne&s;s was like the obligation it&s;elf, multiplied a thou&s;and fold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>YET nothing is more certain, than that Henry had rather have been indebted for &s;uch obligation and &s;uch &s;ervice, infinite as they were, to any one than to Olivia.</P>
<P>On the morning that followed the&s;e tran&s;|actions, a letter, under the great &s;eal of the family, was di&s;patched to Charles Stuart: then, as Henry, who was ma&s;ter of all his movements, per&s;ectly knew, on a vi&s;it in the neighbourhood. That amiable youth &s;oon obeyed the &s;ummons; for friend&s;hip, high and aweful as are her claims, was but &s;econ|dary in his bo&s;om. The fir&s;t grand object of attraction at the ca&s;tle, like that of Henry at the abbey, alas! was Love; a &s;ecret known as yet only to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="195">Charles Stuart, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the fatal affair in the plea&s;ure-grounds, was u&s;hered into the ca&s;tle by John, who met him with Henry at the gate; Sir Armine then received him with a &s;mile &s;o ineffable, that a by-&s;tander might have &s;uppo&s;ed he had been embracing the &s;on of a dear friend in&s;tead of an inveterate enemy; then turning to Olivia, "Young &s;oldier," continued he, "I have made a mi&s;take. It is here that you ought to pay your fir&s;t acknowledgments: it is to that fair mediatrix we are indebted for your re&s;to|ration to your friend Henry, and to our fire|&s;ide."</P>
<P>Charles conjured up in a moment an ho&s;t of hopes which he had never before dared to indulge; for he was not now to learn Olivia's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and never having received any marks of kindne&s;s from her which were not evidently be&s;towed upon Henry's account, he trembled before her without uttering a word, and did not even make his bow with|out embarra&s;&s;ment. Olivia perceiving this, and who always &s;aw actions in the be&s;t light, imputed it to the auk wardne&s;s of his &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="188" REF="196">and to the abruptne&s;s with which John had brought him in: following therefore that impul&s;e, which invariably led her to aug|ment plea&s;ure and dimini&s;h pain, &s;he cried out, "Indeed, Mr. Stuart, we owe the hap|pine&s;s of your return to your own merits and to Sir Armine's thorough &s;en&s;e of them; and we are all equally happy to &s;ee you at the ca&s;tle, where tho&s;e merits mu&s;t always &s;ecure an independent welcome."</P>
<P>Charles having now had a moment to re|cover him&s;elf, replied with &s;ome coherence: ob&s;erving, "that his pre&s;ent re-in&s;tatement, had been owing infinitely le&s;s to his own merits, than to tho&s;e of every other indi|vidual then pre&s;ent."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this renewal of his privileges, Charles Stuart's re&s;toration at the ca&s;tle was in &s;ome re&s;pects more perplex|ing than Henry's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the abbey. For if it gave him all the opportunities of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with Olivia, he thereby
<PB N="189" REF="197">witne&s;&s;ed but the more evidences of her entire attachment to his rival. Whenever Charles and Olivia were <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</HI> &s;he &s;eldom enter|tained him with any thing but the prai&s;es of his divine friend. If any work of genius happened to be the topic, &s;he would critici&s;e her own remarks, and exclaim, "how much more gracefully the opinion I have offered you, would have been expre&s;&s;ed by your friend." If any benevolent action had been reported to her, though &s;he granted it great merit, &s;he could not but ob&s;erve, "what additional charms it would have received from the manner with which his friend Henry would have done it." If the author of &s;uch action, was not yet di&s;covered, &s;he would in&s;i&s;t, "it could be no other than his friend Henry; &s;he plainly &s;aw his generous and delicate &s;oul in every part of it: indeed, not more in the goodne&s;s it&s;elf, than in the caution with which it was concealed." Or if elegance of manners, grace of motion, hap|pine&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, harmony of voice, or ca&s;e of addre&s;s were talked of, &s;he would be &s;ure before the clo&s;e of the conver&s;ation,
<PB N="190" REF="198">to give powerful rea&s;ons why his friend Henry &s;urpa&s;&s;ed every other man in all the&s;e particulars, and generally concluded by ap|pealing to Charles him&s;elf for a confirmation of her opinion.</P>
<P>Charles Stuart was perfectly &s;en&s;ible of Henry's high preten&s;ions, and very readily admitted Olivia's eulogy to its utmo&s;t bound; yet he could not help now and then thinking it hard, that whenever he attempted to do ju&s;tice to the claims of his friend, he rendered Olivia wholly forgetful of his own.</P>
<P>Thus the opportunities of cultivating her regard were of no effect; even the favourite character which Henry gave of him to Olivia, with the many recommendations of his per&s;on, heart, or under&s;tanding, all un|objectionable, though they &s;ecured for him the mo&s;t perfect e&s;teem, did not blend there|with the &s;malle&s;t particle of love; yet Henry, as well from his &s;incere friend&s;hip to Charles, as from his &s;incere love to Caroline, tried hard to make his friend an object of Olivia's affection. But, as a di&s;covery of this would have counteracted his purpo&s;e, the&s;e endea|vours
<PB N="191" REF="199">were indirect: and the&s;e very obliqui|ties added to the perplexity. Olivia, for in|&s;tance, like Caroline, was enamoured of mu&s;ic; Charles had &s;kill both to &s;ing and play; and Henry would &s;eldom let an even|ing pa&s;s without calling upon Charles for a &s;ong. Olivia moved a minuet to great perfection; and when the families were a&s;|&s;embled, her fond father would often whi&s;per Henry, "to u&s;e his intere&s;t with Olivia to give him his favourite." Henry, to avoid this, would every now and then frame excu&s;es that might give to Charles the chance of Olivia for a partner. At one time he pre|tended to be &s;uddenly &s;eized by the cramp, at another, he had &s;ome how twi&s;ted his ancle, and would limp towards Olivia to make his apologies, propo&s;ing at the &s;ame time, the &s;ervices of his friend Charles, de|claring, "he him&s;elf, as &s;he mu&s;t perceive, could not walk the figure if he might have the univer&s;e." At another time, &s;o violent an head-ach, without any warning, would come upon him, ju&s;t as Mr. Clare was mak|ing the reque&s;t, that he would approach
<PB N="192" REF="200">Olivia, holding his hand to his forehead, intreating, "that his misfortune might not prevent her father or the company from the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her dance, e&s;pecially as his friend Charles could &s;o well &s;upply his place:" then, without giving her time to object, he would ha&s;ten to Charles as his &s;ub&s;titute. The very idea, however, of pain or of indi&s;po&s;ition of Henry, was &s;ufficient to unfit her for the reli&s;h of any amu&s;ement; &s;he would generally, therefore, be taken ill on &s;uch occa&s;ions as &s;uddenly as him&s;elf, though with much more of reality; and once when Charles attempted to conquer her objection, and earne&s;tly repeated the reque&s;t, &s;he cried out, "Good heavens! Mr. Stuart, have you no feeling? would you have me dance when your friend is unwell?" Now and then her father, to whom her dancing was a perfect banquet, would interpo&s;e, in obedience to whom &s;he would &s;tand up and &s;uffer Charles to take her hand, but even then her attentions would go to Henry: &s;he would beg her father "not to hum the air quite &s;o jovially as u&s;ual," and bribing him
<PB N="193" REF="201">to &s;ofter tones with a ki&s;s; "becau&s;e you know, dear &s;ir," would &s;he &s;ay, "it will di&s;tract poor Henry's head;" then tripping to Lady Fitzorton, &s;eated at the harp&s;ichord, &s;he would be&s;eech her "to play the minuet as lightly as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Piano! piani&s;&s;imo! my dear madam!" cried Olivia, "I can plainly &s;ee Henry is in torture with that ugly head|ach." After all this, &s;he acquitted her&s;elf &s;o ill, that even her father, in who&s;e opinion &s;he could do few things ill, would &s;ometimes &s;ay, "O' my con&s;cience! child, one would think that you had never been at a boarding &s;chool;" and &s;ometimes Lady Fitzorton perceiving her &s;ituation, would ri&s;e to her relief, and by an hand&s;ome apology to Charles, "beg &s;he might be permitted to &s;it down, and take &s;ome other opportunity, for you cannot be ignorant, my dear &s;ir," addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Charles, "if your friend Henry's finger does but ach, it is a death wound to this apprehen&s;ive &s;impleton." When, how|ever, &s;he did labour through her ta&s;k, &s;he would run to Henry, whom &s;he fancied by his gravity, was offended at her inattention
<PB N="194" REF="202">to his friend, or perhaps, at her own defects, and &s;ay, "nay, but you mu&s;t not be angry with me for my aukwardne&s;s, it was your own fault, and it will be quite ill-natured of you if you don't make my excu&s;es to Mr. Stuart, by telling him I &s;hould have done more ju&s;tice to him, if his friend Henry had been in better health and &s;pirits."</P>
<P>Thus was poor Charles &s;till making good the ground of his rival in all things. The mortification was &s;hared equally by Henry, who, though ju&s;tified by the unconquerable love he bore to Charles's &s;i&s;ter, in every fair endeavour to wean Olivia from her attach|ment to him, and blocked out as he was on all &s;ides from any more direct methods, could not but reproach him&s;elf for practi&s;ing upon her, even on the be&s;t motives, the&s;e little deceptions; yet they were in his ca&s;e &s;anc|tioned in a peculiar manner; for from the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the bent of Olivia's affec|tions, and of the family de&s;igns built there|upon, he could have taken no mea&s;ures le&s;s circuitous, without the hazard of greater mi&s;chief. But for a di&s;po&s;ition like Henry's,
<PB N="195" REF="203">not to do or &s;ay &s;omething kind, after he had done or &s;aid any thing har&s;h or cruel, appear|ed the harde&s;t ta&s;k in the world: and if there had been a moment of his life in which he could have forgot his whole heart was Caro|line's, he would in that moment have offered it to Olivia.</P>
<P>Thus he was continually hara&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;tle and at the abbey: the tendere&s;t love of Olivia innocently, yet &s;trongly accumulated his embarra&s;&s;ment; to render it yet more arduous, Olivia multiplied her claims to his love and honour; and all who had a natural right over Henry, and whom in every other in&s;tance he delighted to obey, grew more and more pointedly importunate.</P>
<P>A &s;ituation &s;ufficiently arduous; yet was that of his friend Charles no le&s;s difficult. His honour, which was &s;uch as became a &s;oldier and a friend, bound up the &s;ecret of Henry's attachment to his &s;i&s;ter with more than ribs of iron, although a di&s;clo&s;ure, either through the generous or indignant pa&s;|&s;ions of Olivia, or of &s;ome of the family, might immediately, or ultimately, produce
<PB N="196" REF="204">a turn in his favour. Henry, indeed, more than once wi&s;hed to make him the medium of his explanation on this head; but the little chance of its &s;ucce&s;s, and the great hazard of throwing the families into confu&s;ion, with the fear that Charles him&s;elf might be looked upon as a go-between, and again expelled the ca&s;tle, with the hope he &s;ometimes in|dulged&mdash;what is the wild hope, that love cannot indulge?&mdash;that time and opportunity might, in the bo&s;om of Olivia, operate in his favour, determined both the young friends to enter on an oath of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Not a &s;yllable, therefore, that implied pre|attachment, dared poor Charles adventure in his mo&s;t unre&s;erved conver&s;ations at the ca&s;tle, about Henry's attachment to his &s;i&s;ter; and whenever Olivia expre&s;&s;ed an impatience to become per&s;onally acquainted with lady and Mi&s;s Stuart, all he could do was deeply to regret the unhappy di&s;pute, or el&s;e return the compliment by a bow. Neither could this haple&s;s lover, for equally cogent rea&s;ons, utter a word to Caroline of Henry's &s;ituation with Olivia, or even of his own pa&s;&s;ion for
<PB N="197" REF="205">that lady, &s;ince the fir&s;t would have betrayed his friend's &s;ecret, and the &s;econd would have di&s;covered his own: &s;uch are the labyrinths of love!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES and Henry, therefore, could confide &s;afely only in each other, and under many trying circum&s;tances they were found faithful. With the mo&s;t generous ardour and &s;incerity they congratulated, and condoled as occurrences of hope or of de&s;pair aro&s;e be|tween them. If Henry &s;ought occa&s;ion to throw the merits of Charles under the eye of Olivia, Charles with no le&s;s zeal favoured his &s;uit with Caroline. They mingled &s;ighs and tears of friend&s;hip and of love: they felt forcibly that the &s;ame doating fondne&s;s of their fathers, procured them, in de&s;pite of alienation, the welcome of one at the ca&s;tle, and of the other to the abbey. But Henry had, hitherto, withheld, even from his bo&s;om friend, the dire alteration of his affairs at the abbey; yet Charles began to wonder that
<PB N="198" REF="206">Henry had become a le&s;s frequent vi&s;itor there&mdash;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find him melting into tears, and yet more to hear him fre|quently a&s;k tho&s;e que&s;tions about Caroline's health, to which he him&s;elf could, as he &s;up|po&s;ed, receive a per&s;onal an&s;wer.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved him not &s;eldom bur&s;ting into agony as he pronounced Caroline's very name, and was a&s;toni&s;hed at the my&s;terious manner of Henry, when, accompanying him to the end of the avenue that led to the abbey, he would linger there, &s;urvey the man&s;ion, embrace his friend, contend with heavy emo|tions, then ru&s;h towards the ca&s;tle in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. At home al&s;o, Charles per|ceived that Sir Gui&s;e had become more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">awningly civil than u&s;ual to his wife and daughter,&mdash;a certain progno&s;tic of &s;ome un|dermining artifice; and that lady Stuart and Caroline maintained a dumb kind of grief. Indeed, the mazes were &s;o involved that Henry could not come to an explanation with any one, and lea&s;t of all with Olivia. Often was he on the verge of pouring into her gentle heart his fulle&s;t confidence, and throw|ing
<PB N="199" REF="207">him&s;elf on her genero&s;ity&mdash;and once, when the con&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart had a&s;cended his lip, and trembled there, he was re&s;trained by an unexpected &s;eries of circum&s;tances, that bound him to &s;ilence more firmly than before&mdash;circum&s;tances which, alas! tied his tongue more potently, than if it had been bound by a thou&s;and chains.</P>

<P>WHATEVER favourites the reader may have at the ca&s;tle of Fitzorton, and we tru&s;t it contains not a few, he will accompany us back with a &s;ympathizing heart to Gui&s;e Abbey.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Caroline, that fair pattern of filial piety, gained her chamber, after her folemn taking leave of Henry, than a certain triumph which attends a truly great mind, after it has &s;acrificed the deare&s;t pa&s;&s;ions to the aweful duties of nature, &s;eemed to play about her like a &s;urrounding glory. Yet was this triumph not like that of the &s;toic, who prides him&s;elf upon obtaining a conque&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="208">where there has been no formidable enemy to contend with, his own cold nature leaving him nothing to &s;ubdue, but of an heart fully &s;en&s;ible of its lo&s;s as of its gain. The amiable victim had obeyed an ab&s;olute father; but a lover worthy even of her affection was the price of that obedience. Her own gentle hand had heaped upon him a fre&s;h burden of &s;orrow, and though &s;he repented not of the duty &s;he had performed, nor the pangs with which it was attended to her&s;elf, &s;he felt the deepe&s;t concern that the peace of Henry &s;hould be involved,&mdash;as it mu&s;t appear to him, by her own cruelty or caprice; for &s;he could plainly perceive, he was neither con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity nor virtue of her conduct. Amid&s;t reflections like the&s;e, &s;he walked to that window of her apartment which gave her a pro&s;pect of the ca&s;tle, and which being at the top of the abbey, over|looked all malicious ob&s;tructions. She in|&s;tantly beheld her Henry, taking his melan|choly way towards his home, through that very avenue &s;o dear, yet fatal to remem|brance. That moment a thou&s;and tender
<PB N="201" REF="209">thoughts crouded upon her, and in a tone of the mo&s;t piercing mi&s;ery, &s;he exclaimed&mdash; "What! Oh! what, dear youth, would I not give, did rigid duty permit me to open this ca&s;ement, and invite thee to retrace thy foot&s;teps! and intreat of thee to return to love and Caroline? Methinks, I would pur|cha&s;e &s;uch a tran&s;port, though but of one day's continuance, with years of captivity; nay, with the years of my life! and art thou going from me with a &s;entiment in that gentle bo&s;om again&s;t thy Caroline, as if &s;he were in&s;en&s;ible to virtue, worth, and tenderne&s;s, like thine?"</P>
<P>As &s;he had fini&s;hed this pa&s;&s;ionate apo&s;trophe, &s;he ob&s;erved Henry quicken his pace, then &s;top abruptly, and turn towards the abbey, then mea&s;ure back the &s;pace, and then move pen&s;ively forward. "Alas!" re&s;umed Caro|line, "that &s;he who thus afflicts may not comfort thee! that &s;he who has thus the power to brui&s;e may not make thee whole again! Too well tho&s;e di&s;ordered &s;teps, and irre&s;olute motions, denote the di&s;orders of thy &s;oul!" While &s;he was thus &s;peaking
<PB N="202" REF="210">Henry had turned again, and &s;tood fixed in the centre of the avenue, directing his eyes to her apartment. She had evidently caught his view, and touched by the occa&s;ion had half opened the window to repeat, and re|ceive the la&s;t look and adieu, when that &s;tern duty &s;eemed to menace reproof more terrible than her father's, and in thunder to &s;ay, ra&s;h girl forbear! and as if &s;he had, indeed, heard the&s;e words pronounced by Sir Gui&s;e, &s;he &s;uddenly turned from the window, and denied her heart the only comfort it was capable of ta&s;ting. "When, O! when, will implaca|ble duty have done with its rigours?" re&s;umed &s;he, withdrawing to the other end of the apartment remote from the ca&s;ement. She then folded her hands together, and kneeling down, &s;he exclaimed&mdash;"O! eternally beloved, though for ever relinqui&s;hed, youth! if thou art &s;till gazing on the walls that enclo&s;e thy Caroline, may &s;ome good angel, who has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed virtue in guard, whi&s;per to thee the prayer which now breathes from my &s;oul; and may a knowledge of thy Caroline's employment at this moment &s;trengthen thee

I cannot, cannot bear it!" then rai&s;ing her&s;elf again, and &s;inking almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;he exclaimed, "O God, who ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed, enable me to endure!"</P>

<P>IN this &s;ituation lady Stuart, &s;trongly agitated, entered the room, and &s;eeing the &s;tate of her daughter, exclaimed&mdash;"O my child, my child, that the life or death of a mother could make thee happy! I come to thee for comfort, and thou ha&s;t none to be|&s;tow, but art in want of it thy&s;elf; nor has thy powerle&s;s parent any to give&mdash;&s;he flies to thy protection, to thy pity, in the bitter moment of a hu&s;band's cur&s;e&mdash;yes, my child, thy father &s;ends me to thee with his cur&s;e upon us both!"</P>
<P>Caroline, at the terrifying &s;ound, &s;prung up, and fervently ejaculating, "my father's cur&s;e!" then lifting up her eyes, &s;treaming with tears, to heaven&mdash;"But the Father of all &s;hall ble&s;s us both!" &s;aid &s;he, "he is a forgiving parent, and we will intercede with him for the pardon of him whofe wrath is thus kindled again&s;t us! alas, it is the infir|mity of his nature, and he &s;uffers more &s;orely than our&s;elves!" Lady Stuart &s;hook her
<PB N="205" REF="213">head, and tenderly ki&s;&s;ing her child&mdash;"The prayers of innocence, like thine, may call down pardon, even for the guilty," &s;aid &s;he; "but for the unremitting, unprovoked, and unre&s;i&s;ted cruelty of Sir Gui&s;e"&mdash;Here &s;he &s;topt, and bur&s;ting into a flood of tears&mdash; "&s;urely, &s;urely," added &s;he, "there is, there can be no hope&mdash;but I dare not tell thee, my child, how hardly he has treated me!" "Neither dare I enquire," replied Caroline, returning her mother's ki&s;s.&mdash; "The god of pity and pardon intercede for us all!"</P>
<P>The fact was, that Sir Gui&s;e had no &s;ooner quitted the room, after his di&s;cour&s;e with Henry, than lady Stuart, from her &s;uite of apartments which communicated with that where Henry was &s;itting, came to him like the angel of compa&s;&s;ion; and Henry, upon &s;eeing her enter, &s;prung up and fell at her feet in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;"O lady Stuart!" &s;aid he, "Caroline has bani&s;hed me from her pre&s;ence for ever! &s;he is more inexorable even than her father, who would have mediated between us, had not her fixed
<PB N="206" REF="214">obduracy prevented; and I am now left, by both, in utter de&s;pair."</P>
<P>Lady Stuart bewailed his misfortune, but exhorted him to patience, and the hope of happier days; a&s;&s;uring him that the wi&s;hes of her heart went with his own &s;o entirely, that &s;he not only de&s;ired to &s;ee her daughter and him united, but that from that union might proceed a bond of reconcilement be|tween the too long-divided hou&s;es of Stuart and Fitzorton.</P>
<P>As &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, her hu&s;|band, haunted by that perturbed &s;pirit of guilt and cowardice, which, like the never|dying worm, kept him always re&s;tle&s;s, and in motion, and practi&s;ing every &s;ubterfuge of concealment and deceit, returned, and from his u&s;ual hiding place, for his ears and eyes were acquainted with every crevice and aperture throughout the hou&s;e, overheard every &s;yllable: he &s;trode with gigantic &s;teps from the door at which he entered to that which was oppo&s;ite, and then di&s;appeared, ca&s;ting a &s;cornful look at his lady, but without uttering a word; &s;o &s;ubordinate was
<PB N="207" REF="215">even the madne&s;s of his rage to the da&s;tardy of his fears. His poor wife, however, could but too well interpret his &s;ilence. She knew that his unuttered purpo&s;e, like that of the lione&s;s &s;urveying her prey before &s;he extends her fangs, or exalts the terrors of her voice, is but the more inveterately fell for being preceded by dumb delay. And Henry him|&s;elf under&s;tood it &s;ufficiently to exclaim, "O lady Stuart! &s;hould I be the cau&s;e of involv|ing you too, by drawing fre&s;h &s;everities from Sir Gui&s;e, who may, perhaps, mi&s;interpret my &s;uppliant po&s;ture, I am a wretch in|deed!"</P>
<P>"Whatever may be the event, do not &s;tay to &s;hare it, I conjure you," &s;aid lady Stuart, "and if Caroline be dear to thee go this moment from the abbey. She, haple&s;s girl, has too many of my griefs, and of yours, to bear already; and if I can prevent this ri&s;ing &s;torm from reaching her, I will abide its utmo&s;t fury with joy. If then &s;he be precious to you, Mr. Firzorton, depart before my hu&s;band returns, and depend upon
<PB N="208" REF="216">all that a powerle&s;s, but doating mother can do, for a child who is a benefactre&s;s."</P>
<P>Henry folded his hands upon his brea&s;t, and, bowing his head almo&s;t to the earth, in token of unutterable gratitude and grief un|&s;peakable, again left the hou&s;e, which con|tained, at once, his hope and his de&s;pair. After he was gone lady Stuart remained &s;ilent and motionle&s;s, as a &s;tatue, her gentle heart foreboding a thou&s;and terrors. Never &s;tood &s;he in &s;o much need of her filial com|forter, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, however, &s;he had predetermined not to invoke. And, indeed, all unable as &s;he was to bear the hurricanes which were ince&s;&s;antly beating again&s;t her by the gu&s;ts of this tempe&s;tuous man, &s;he never called her Caroline to her aid, &s;ave when &s;he happened to be by as the clouds were gathering, or likely to gather. On the contrary, &s;he would felicitate her&s;elf when|ever they bur&s;t on her alone, and rejoice in the thought that her poor child had been &s;pared: and after the &s;torms were pa&s;t, her greate&s;t care was to prevent Caroline from
<PB N="209" REF="217">knowing there had been any matter of di&s;|turbance. In order to effect this, &s;he would u&s;e every means to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and try to e&s;cape the penetrating eyes of Caro|line, till the redne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by torrents of tears, from her own, left no traces that might betray &s;he had been weeping.</P>

<P>THE feeble frame, &s;hattered nerves, and impaired health of lady Stuart, though blooming as her daughter, when &s;he fir&s;t married, would generally prove too weak for her utmo&s;t efforts, and, indeed, whenever &s;he was longer ab&s;ent than u&s;ual, Caroline would hunt her griefs through every apart|ment where &s;he attempted to hide them, and in&s;i&s;t that &s;he had a claim from nature, and nature's god, to number "&s;igh for &s;igh, and groan for groan."</P>
<P>The abject-hearted Sir Gui&s;e, who had been on the watch, like &s;ome fearful &s;cout, and trembling under his commi&s;&s;ion, not daring to put him&s;elf a &s;econd time in
<PB N="210" REF="218">Henry's pre&s;ence, &s;ent into the room to &s;ee if his lady was alone, "but," &s;aid he to the &s;ervant, "if any one &s;hould be with her, pretend &s;ome errand and return."</P>
<P>Every &s;ervant, however, of the family, held the commands of Sir Gui&s;e in abhor|rence, and were perfectly acquainted with his tyranny to their mi&s;tre&s;s, and their young lady, for whom they bore love and re&s;pect equal to their contempt and hate of the ty|rant. Two, indeed, of the dome&s;tics had been opprobriou&s;ly turned out of doors, for refu&s;ing a bribe, to become &s;pies upon the words and actions of either lady Stuart or Caroline.</P>
<P>The per&s;on, who was now di&s;patched by Sir Gui&s;e, was named Denni&s;on, who came into the family with his lady. At her re|que&s;t, al&s;o, when it was the Baronet's intere&s;t to comply with all her wi&s;hes, it was &s;ettled that this worthy adherent, who had pa&s;t his blamele&s;s life in the &s;ervice of her lady&s;hip's family, &s;hould be transferred to the abbey on the union of his younger mi&s;tre&s;s, and hold the &s;ame place he had filled at Edge-combe-Hall,
<PB N="211" REF="219">which was that of hou&s;e &s;tew|ard. The quarrels, which had &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed between him and Sir Gui&s;e, on his lady's ac|count, had been innumerable, and the ex|periments which the Baronet had made to force Denni&s;on to a re&s;ignation of his place, were no le&s;s; "but where my lady lodges, there will I lodge," was his maxim, and the&s;e attempts to get rid of him had been for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended, or rather Sir Gui&s;e's folly abroad had defeated his tyranny at home. And the good &s;teward had di&s;covered certain infidelities, of which he forbore to tell any of the family, for two rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, becau&s;e he held the &s;ecret over the head of his ma&s;ter, as a &s;word in the &s;cabbard, to deter him from farther ill u&s;age of his lady or daughter; and &s;econdly,&mdash;which, indeed, was his only hold over him, &s;oon after the Baronet had him|&s;elf betrayed the &s;aid &s;ecret to his wife, with every wicked aggravation,&mdash;becau&s;e he was fearful any revival of the &s;ubject might encrea&s;e her unea&s;ine&s;s, if not on the article of violated love, of indignant virtue; for the wretch with whom Sir Gui&s;e a&s;&s;ociated was
<PB N="212" REF="220">low born, and of a mind yet more abject. Her name was Tempe&s;t, who had been, in|deed, one of the menial &s;ervants of the fa|mily; yet were there points independent of this woman, the knowledge of which &s;till made Denni&s;on, in &s;ome &s;ort, formidable. As Sir Gui&s;e, therefore, was giving orders to another dome&s;tic, Denni&s;on, who over|heard them, and who, from his ma&s;ter's re&s;tle&s;s agility, knew there was &s;ome fre&s;h mi&s;chief on foot, undertook to be him&s;elf the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t adherent, who was &s;till an un|corrupted child of nature, no &s;ooner &s;aw the condition in which he found his mi&s;tre&s;s, than, di&s;regarding the injunctions of Sir Gui&s;e, he &s;aid, "my ma&s;ter, madam, de|&s;ires to know if you are alone; but pray, my lady, let me &s;ay you are unwell, for I fear he is not, ju&s;t now, in the be&s;t humour, and I am &s;ure your lady&s;hip is not able to put up with what he may choo&s;e to &s;ay in tantarums. Do pray, good my lady, let me tell him it will be out of your power to receive him for &s;ome hours; and in the mean while, I will
<PB N="213" REF="221">&s;ee what can be done to bring him about; and &s;hall I beg Mi&s;s Caroline to come, and keep your lady&s;hip company, until I have got him round a little? &s;he is a dear &s;oul; and will do all &s;he can to make the be&s;t of bad matters, but it is a &s;ad pity young ma&s;ter &s;hould be from the abbey. He could tame the old lion, at once, and make him as meek as a lamb; dear Mr. Henry Fitzorton is gone away. I met him awhile ago, poor gentleman, ju&s;t as he was opening the great door, and his honour &s;hook me by the hand, God ble&s;s him; and with his heart ready to bur&s;t, &s;aid, 'farewell Mr. Denni&s;on, fare|well; pray take care of your lady, and of your young mi&s;tre&s;s, for when I have pa&s;&s;ed this thre&s;hold, Mr. Denni&s;on, I mu&s;t never come within the&s;e doors again.'</P>
<P>"Then the devil may &s;hut it, honoured Sir, &s;aid I, for Denni&s;on, for I would be turned out of doors my&s;elf, &s;ooner than be the man to clo&s;e it upon &s;uch a friend to the family, as you are, and whom both my lady and young mi&s;tre&s;s love &s;o dearly. 'Do they love me &s;o much?' cried the Squire,
<PB N="214" REF="222">'does Mi&s;s Caroline, think you? and yet, Denni&s;on, &s;he it is who'&mdash;Here, madam, the poor gentleman's words were choaked in his &s;ighs, and offering me a pur&s;e of money&mdash; which your lady&s;hip mu&s;t be &s;ure, I refu&s;ed, and then bidding me again, farewell, and again &s;haking me by the hand, he ran out of the hou&s;e."</P>

<P>THE &s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition of Sir Gui&s;e not &s;uffering him to wait while hone&s;t Den|ni&s;on ended his harangue, and having learned from another of the &s;ervants that Henry had left the hou&s;e, and mu&s;t by this time have got to the ca&s;tle, he went into the room, bid|ding Denni&s;on, who, from an unexpected mildne&s;s in his ma&s;ter's voice, withdrew.</P>
<P>The very in&s;tant, however, he had &s;o done, he approached lady Stuart, dying with her tears, and in a governed tone, which, as it were, ground his words into a dreadful mutter between his teeth, which teeth he gna&s;hed together, cried, "traiterous woman!
<PB N="215" REF="223">I &s;ee you are &s;tirring up my daughter to rebel again&s;t her father's authority, and are divid|ing my own hou&s;e again&s;t me, as much as that of dete&s;ted Fitzorton's. Do not &s;peak; I heard you promi&s;e your a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the young &s;erpent, out of that ne&s;t of &s;nakes, crawling to you on his knees. But the&s;e are my open enemies; they are, by compari&s;on generous;&mdash;the mo&s;t baneful vipers &s;prung from my loins, or are nouri&s;hed in my bo|&s;om. My cur&s;es on you&mdash;yes, the cur&s;e of an hu&s;band repay your treachery! and for that young adder, whom you pre&s;ented to me in the &s;hape of a daughter, go bear to her an equal execration, and tell her an in|jured father &s;ent it as his la&s;t legacy; go&mdash; and if a &s;entence, from either of you, reaches even the &s;ervants' hall, tremble for the con|&s;equence!"</P>
<P>This terrible menace he accompanied with action &s;o fierce, his eyeballs rolling, and his lips covered with foam, from the torture of pa&s;&s;ion controuled, that lady Stuart had hardly &s;trength enough left her to totter out
<PB N="216" REF="224">of the room, and &s;tagger up to Caroline's apartment, in the manner before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Fain would &s;he have withdrawn to her own chamber, but was, on this &s;ore occa&s;ion led, by an involuntary impul&s;e, to her only com|forter, her Caroline, who lo&s;t her own &s;or|rows in tho&s;e of her mother; but, pre&s;&s;ed by a multitude of emotions, &s;he &s;unk at her child's feet into the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions; nor, in the intervals of &s;en&s;e, could &s;ay more than, "Oh! let me not &s;ee my hu&s;band. I cannot bear the &s;ight of him again." She remained in this condition the whole night, and with little intermi&s;&s;ion until the night following&mdash;a troubled doze en&s;ued, on awak|ing from which, &s;he felt her &s;en&s;es, but not her frame, re&s;tored. The tender Caroline &s;eldom left her arms, while her guilty hu&s;|band diligently avoided both his wife and child.</P>
<P>Once, however, when he found his lady had not been able to quit his daughter's apartments, he heard the voice of his wife, exclaiming, "my deare&s;t Caroline, grieve
<PB N="217" REF="225">not, all will be well &s;oon;" on which he took him&s;elf down &s;tairs, muttering, "this is no time for me; I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is in one of her damned fits again, and I have had enough of them already.</P>
<P>Her di&s;order was on the third day aug|mented by a fever, in the beginning of which &s;he intreated &s;he might be conveyed to her own chamber&mdash;Caroline oppo&s;ed this with &s;trong, but tender controul. "More than my life depends upon it," &s;aid lady Stuart; "but do you, my Caroline, and your own woman be my conductors." Finding her fixed on that mea&s;ure, Caroline obeyed in the evening of that day, and a&s;&s;uming a &s;trength, which on every other occa&s;ion would have been wanting, and was even now incredible, for &s;he was delicate in the extreme, &s;he folded her &s;ick parent in her arms, and with &s;carcely any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the attendant, bore her to her own bed; nor did the pious &s;on, the filial example of ancient days, when he carried Anchi&s;es, his aged father, from the flames of Troy, exhibit a &s;ight &s;o touching, as did this fair and duteous daughter, bending under
<PB N="218" REF="226">the weight of an agonized and tender mother, ki&s;&s;ing her burning cheek at every &s;tep, and prote&s;ting, that if the breath with which &s;he cooled her feveri&s;h lip, could in&s;pire into her the &s;pirit of returning health, &s;he would die with tran&s;port.</P>
<P>Two long months did the uncomplaining victim endure this bitter vi&s;itation of heaven, during which, amid&s;t the &s;corchings of her fever, the &s;ilence of her &s;woons, and the ravings of her delirium, when &s;he would call with piercing &s;creams of terror upon her child, her life-pre&s;erving child, to &s;ave her from the imagined fury of her hu&s;band&mdash; during all the&s;e was that angelic child, her con&s;tant nur&s;e and attendant. Often did &s;he &s;teal from her mother's pillow, wet with her tears, and bathe her father's hand with the &s;till dropping tears of filial mi&s;ery, to intreat he would come and &s;peak comfort to his di&s;tracted wife. But the thought that lady Stuart had betrayed his &s;ecret to Henry and Charles, and the con&s;equent vengeance he had to expect, with the idea that Caroline had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the plot, made him not only
<PB N="219" REF="227">deaf to all her interce&s;&s;ions, but induced him often to &s;purn her from him with the mo&s;t bitter denunciations, and brutal violence.&mdash; Denni&s;on, al&s;o, exerted his utmo&s;t power, and would &s;ecretly have called in the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his young ma&s;ter and Henry, had not Caroline, apprehen&s;ive of the fatal con|&s;equences that might en&s;ue, enjoined him to keep his lady's illne&s;s, as long as po&s;&s;ible, from her brother, and every other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Luckily the en&s;ign was, at this time, in winter quarters, which he could not again quit as well on account of his late fre|quent trips to the abbey and ca&s;tle, as a reprimand from his Colonel; and Henry Fitzorton, who lived within a very few &s;hort miles of this hou&s;e of mi&s;ery, and who, in|deed, re&s;ided in the con&s;tant view of it, hav|ing appropriated an apartment in the ca&s;tle, as did Caroline in the abbey, parallel to that which held the object of his affections, was daily more and more abridged of the power of communicating his griefs even to Charles, by the cruel injunctions, as he then conceived them to be, of the once-complying Caroline;
<PB N="220" REF="228">but notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e lets and hindrances he never &s;uffered a day to pa&s;s without taking his &s;olitary circuit round the precincts of the abbey, wandering through its woods, or even brooding in its caverns.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of Sir Gui&s;e, or any of the family, when he ru&s;hed from his haunts, though his heart yearned to make enquiries, he would again plunge into the middle of the fore&s;t. How did he wi&s;h to pre&s;ent the pacquet which he was &s;till augmenting, and &s;till carried about with him, yet without daring to profit, even of opportunity! Alas! twice &s;ince his bani&s;hment had he attempted to gain admittance for his letters, by the medium of Denni&s;on, and twice received them back unopened.</P>
<P>If after this he met the faithful Steward, he would &s;till run to him, as to an a&s;&s;ured friend, and ea&s;e his afflicted &s;oul by ha&s;ty in|terrogations, which, &s;ince the unfortunate delivery of the letters, the poor old man could only an&s;wer with &s;orrowful looks, that &s;ent the wretched wanderer away more mi&s;er|able. Sometimes would he pa&s;s the darke&s;t
<PB N="221" REF="229">night, &s;tormy and bitter, beneath a clump of venerable oaks, mingled with cypre&s;s, that encircled her chamber; to the window of which he would direct his eyes, and addre&s;s his prayers, li&s;tening every &s;ound that came from within and without. Thus would he remain until the unwelcome light of the morning drove him again into his leafy con|cealments; in the mo&s;t gloomy rece&s;&s;es of which, forgetful of his accu&s;tomed delights, forgetful even of his duties, &s;o &s;ore was the pre&s;&s;ure of his de&s;pair, and &s;o had it warped his &s;oul&mdash;he would linger out the day, roam|ing from one entangled path to another, often throwing him&s;elf down in the mo&s;t un|frequented places, and often climbing the highe&s;t tree to gaze a moment at the abbey, &s;training his eager view to di&s;cover that part which contained his Caroline; and then at night-fall would he &s;teal out of the fore&s;t, like one of its fearful inhabitants, and return to his nocturnal abodes.</P>

<P>AT the end of the third month of lady Stuart's &s;ickne&s;s, in the cour&s;e of which the mercile&s;s fever had nearly drunk her &s;pirits, withered her heart, and dried her blood; and when ince&s;&s;ant watchings and &s;ympathizing griefs had reduced her &s;till a&s;&s;iduous child almo&s;t to a like condition, the maternal martyr, feeling that the &s;ilver chord of life was almo&s;t broken, pointed to a little cabinet of &s;ilver, curiou&s;ly inwrought, which &s;tood at the edge of her dre&s;&s;ing-table.&mdash;Being brought, &s;he gave the key of it to Caroline, and pointed to a locket that hung to her bo&s;om, de&s;iring Caroline to touch the &s;pring which would pre&s;ent her with another key. "And that key, my child," &s;aid her lady&s;hip," "will di&s;cover what the drawers in the cabinet contain."</P>
<P>In a cover of pea-green &s;ilk tied, lady Stuart took from the innermo&s;t cabinet three &s;mall boxes inveloped in as many ca&s;es; her
<PB N="223" REF="231">whole frame was under vi&s;ible agitation. Thrice &s;he &s;unk down on her pillow, and ro&s;e to re&s;ume her labour; at length &s;he produced from their coverings the miniatures of her own father and mother: &s;he looked at them alternately for &s;ome time, pre&s;&s;ing them by turns to her bo&s;om, and then gave them to Caroline&mdash;"My deare&s;t child, when the&s;e were fir&s;t be&s;towed upon me, the oath of my &s;ecret &s;oul was given to my God, never to part with them, but in the la&s;t hour of my life, nor even then, unle&s;s I could be|queath them to one whom I was a&s;&s;ured would value them even, if that were po&s;&s;ible, as I have done&mdash;el&s;e, it was part of my vow, to have them buried with me on my bo&s;om, neare&s;t to my heart.

<P>Caroline received the miniatures in the eloquence of &s;olemn &s;orrow, yet uttered not a word, nor &s;hed a tear.</P>
<P>"They were the gift of my dear parents upon my bridal day. From that day was expected more happine&s;s, perhaps, than I have ever de&s;erved; but to whatever cau&s;e, alas! my bitter di&s;appointment might be owing, I will not, cannot, call it a day ac|cur&s;ed, &s;ince my child has been a recom|pence for a whole life of mi&s;ery. Let me pre&s;s once more the precious re&s;emblances to the&s;e adoring lips, and then they are thine, my love, until it &s;hall plea&s;e Providence to bring thee al&s;o, to the bed of death. There &s;hould&s;t thou find thy&s;elf parent of a child like thy&s;elf, and as worthy to be tru&s;ted with a pledge &s;o ine&s;timable, let them accompany thy parting benediction, even as they do mine; if not, let them repo&s;e upon thy filial bo&s;om, whereon I now imprint the la&s;t ma|ternal
<PB N="225" REF="233">ki&s;s&mdash;O, let them de&s;cend with thee into that tomb, where it is my late&s;t charge, who&s;oever may go before thee, to take e&s;pe|cial care thy remains are placed as near to tho&s;e of thy mother, as thou art at this, her dying moment!"</P>
<P>The latter part of this &s;peech &s;he articu|lated with great difficulty, and with many interruptions for renovated power of utter|ance.</P>
<P>Caroline rai&s;ed and reclined her by turns, but was &s;till &s;ilent&mdash;hearing voices below, &s;he appeared &s;omewhat moved, and lady Stuart was agitated. The latter, however, recovering, gently &s;aid, "if Sir Gui&s;e &s;hould chance to come, my love, let him be ad|mitted, and if he &s;hould not, you will not forget to tell him, that more than one prayer for him has pa&s;t my lips, and thou&s;ands have been offered up, in &s;ilence, from my &s;oul."</P>
<P>Here Caroline fir&s;t found a voice&mdash;"Un|u&s;ed to griefs of this nature, perhaps he is now mourning apart&mdash;O, if any &s;en&s;ation re|bukes him at a moment like this, his ab&s;ence
<PB N="226" REF="234">is kind, and he is more to be commi&s;erated than his child."</P>
<P>Lady Stuart ro&s;e with energy to embrace Caroline, and then taking up the &s;ilken ca&s;e, which enclo&s;ed the third miniature, &s;he &s;aid, "This too, thou frequent pre&s;erver of the life I am about to lay down, will be dear to thee. It is a likene&s;s of what was once thy mother; alas! how changed."</P>
<P>As Caroline was placing it in her bo&s;om, &s;he looked at the &s;imilitude of the once blooming happy maid, now broken-hearted wife, and abruptly turned her head, to hide from her dying parent, the agony that ro&s;e out of the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>After this, lady Stuart lay for near a quar|ter of an hour, as in death, during which, a gentle tapping was given at the door of her chamber, heard only by the female attendant; Caroline being ab&s;orbed, with her eyes fixed on tho&s;e of her mother: and as &s;he reclined her lips near tho&s;e of lady Stuart, to catch the la&s;t a&s;piration of life, her woman pa&s;t &s;oftly, and unperceived, to the door.&mdash;
<PB N="227" REF="235">"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid the per&s;on that entered, mak|ing at the &s;ame time &s;igns of &s;ilence, and moving on tiptoe. The maid gently drew the curtain of the bed, on the door &s;ide, to its extent. A &s;oft tread was again heard on the &s;tairs, but the appearance of the phy|&s;ician, in the next in&s;tant, &s;eemed to explain it. Caroline, delivering her mother's hand into the phy&s;ician's, &s;aid, with trembling hope&mdash;"&s;he has a pul&s;e, &s;ir, and I felt her breath this in&s;tant on my cheek." "Yes, there is life," replied the doctor, "but, alas! &s;o little, that a few more imperfect pul&s;ations, and probably"&mdash;"For pity's &s;ake," interpo&s;ed Caroline, "anticipate not her death&mdash;I fear, I fear I am not yet pre|pared to bear it." Lady Stuart began to move her lips, and then, without opening her eyes, ejaculated faintly&mdash;"Help, Caro|line, help me to ble&s;s your brother, my always good and tender Charles." A whi&s;|pered voice from the other &s;ide, &s;carcely more forcible than that of Lady Stuart, breathed forth&mdash;"&s;he &s;peaks!"</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="236">"And if departed &s;ouls," continued her lady&s;hip, "are permitted to know, and to feel the concerns, of what was mo&s;t dear to them in this mortal world"&mdash;</P>
<P>She made a &s;econd pau&s;e, to gain &s;trength, for the tide of life had nearly ebbed away.</P>
<P>"My fir&s;t prayer to the fountain of all good, &s;hall be"&mdash;</P>
<P>A third time &s;he wanted breath.</P>
<P>"Yes, my fir&s;t prayer to the great di&s;|po&s;er &s;hall be, that Caroline and Henry"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Good God! can this be &s;upported?" whi&s;pered a voice more faint than the former.</P>
<P>Caroline turned, as if &s;he had indi&s;tinctly hear the &s;ounds, but in the next moment a lengthened &s;igh from lady Stuart recalled her whole attention.</P>
<P>"That is her la&s;t!" &s;aid the phy&s;ician&mdash; "La&s;t! O God! O God! my mother is dead," re&s;umed the voice on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Caroline &s;tarted.</P>
<P>"Your mother," rejoined the phy&s;ician, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to that part of the room from whence the voice was heard, "is now
<PB N="229" REF="237">an angel in heaven." The oppo&s;ite curtains were &s;uddenly thrown a&s;ide, pre&s;enting to the a&s;toni&s;hed view of Caroline, her brother and Henry Fitzorton &s;tanding &s;ide by &s;ide, and holding the curtain in their hands to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>A &s;hriek, which &s;eemed to be the bur&s;t of her long accumulating, and long &s;uppre&s;&s;|ed emotions, broke from Caroline, as &s;he &s;unk to the floor, like one who has been &s;tricken with &s;udden death. Henry ran round to the other &s;ide of the bed, and caught her in his arms, while Charles a&s;&s;i&s;ted to convey her to the air of the window, which the phy&s;ician had thrown open for that purpo&s;e. Mean while, the terror-&s;truck at|tendants ran down &s;tairs for the u&s;ual re&s;tora|tives, exclaiming, "my dear young mi&s;tre&s;s, and my lady, are dead! both dead!&mdash;where is Sir Gui&s;e? where is my ma&s;ter?"</P>
<P>The Baronet and Denni&s;on were at this time together: the latter, not expecting his lady to be &s;o near her end, was trying to keep his ma&s;ter in conver&s;ation till Charles and Henry, to whom he had opened the
<PB N="230" REF="238">door, had come down &s;tairs. This &s;udden alarm, however, hurried him out of his re|collection, and rather dragging than leading his ma&s;ter, who was him&s;elf bewildered, they got into the chamber before Caroline had recovered from her &s;woon, or any of the parties had altered their po&s;ition, &s;ave that the cheek of Caroline, utterly uncon&s;cious of a pre&s;&s;ure, was repo&s;ing upon that of Henry.</P>
<P>A new language mu&s;t be invented, before a ju&s;t de&s;cription can be given of Sir Gui&s;e in this &s;cene; his figure, attitude, and look, denoted ten thou&s;and emotions, &s;ubordinate to one, however, which, like Aaron's &s;er|pent, &s;wallowed up the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician fearing that if Caroline, on the fir&s;t return of her &s;en&s;es, &s;hould be pre|&s;ented with the view of her decea&s;ed mother, it might bring on &s;ome fatal relap&s;e, had again drawn the bed curtains clo&s;e round, &s;o that the corp&s;e was concealed from view. It was not, therefore, the condition of his breathle&s;s wife, nor was it the &s;ight of his daughter, &s;tretched like another corp&s;e un|der his eye; nor yet was it the unexpected
<PB N="231" REF="239">&s;ight of the darling &s;on, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed at the di&s;tance of &s;ome hundred miles, and whom, at any other time, his &s;avage heart would have bounded to embrace; but it was &s;imply, and &s;ingly, the &s;oul-&s;taggering &s;ight of that Henry Fitzorton, whom he thought never more to behold within the walls of the abbey, holding that daughter, who at his command had &s;olemnly forbade him her pre|&s;ence, enfolded again in his arms! and in his wife's bed-chamber! and manife&s;tly with the con&s;ent and concurrence of his &s;on! In con|firmation of all which, one hand of this very &s;on was tenderly cla&s;ped in Henry's, while he gently cha&s;ed the temples of his &s;i&s;ter with the other. After &s;urveying the parties for the &s;pace of a minute, almo&s;t &s;uffocated for want of utterance, he &s;houted forth in a voice &s;o little human, that it &s;eemed the howl of a fami&s;hed wolf in the wilderne&s;s on the fir&s;t &s;ight of its prey, after long de&s;pair to find it&mdash;"Hell! and its cho&s;en fiends! what do I &s;ee?"&mdash;</P>
<P>This &s;avage exclamation, which might al|mo&s;t have rai&s;ed the dead, and killed the
<PB N="232" REF="240">dying, re&s;tored Caroline, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to her&s;elf, &s;huddering as if the icy hand of fate was on her; and not yet knowing where, and with whom &s;he was. On &s;eeing Sir Gui&s;e, &s;he &s;unk from Henry's arms on her knees, and dropt, as if deprived of life, at her father's feet; yet nothing now &s;eemed to have attraction for Sir Gui&s;e but Henry Fitzorton, on whom he &s;till fixed his &s;taring eye, until the almo&s;t idiot &s;teadine&s;s of his gaze drew, at length, the eyes of Caroline to the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the di&s;traction of confu&s;ed &s;en&s;a|tions &s;he &s;prung from him; but her brother perceiving a dreadful intent brooding in the fell &s;oul of Sir Gui&s;e, then too violently agi|tated to attend to con&s;equences, advanced towards him&mdash;"Forbear, de&s;troyer, to add the broken heart of thy daughter, and the di&s;traction of thy &s;on, to the murder of thy wife." "Thy life," &s;aid Henry, approach|ing him, "depends &s;olely upon thy child's! Beware!"&mdash;But Sir Gui&s;e, driven by his foaming rage out of every prudent pa&s;&s;ion, &s;till cheri&s;hed a de&s;perate purpo&s;e, when
<PB N="233" REF="241">Caroline, with that pre&s;ence of mind, which never but in the ab&s;ence of &s;en&s;e wholly for|&s;ook her, undrew the curtain between Sir Gui&s;e and her mother's corp&s;e, and then led her father towards the bed with one hand, while with the other &s;he pointed to the body; but not a &s;yllable e&s;caped her lips. O weak|ne&s;s of human language! what form of words could have added energy to &s;uch a &s;ilence? The heart of the hardened quaked under it. "Unnatural! behold the work of thy hands," &s;aid the &s;on, dropping on his knees, and pre&s;&s;ing his mother's clay-cold hand fervently to his lips&mdash;Henry again whi&s;pered Sir Gui&s;e "to beware!" but Charles, now almo&s;t frantic with grief for the lo&s;s of a parent, whom he loved tenderly, and maddening with re&s;ent|ment again&s;t her de&s;troyer, would certainly have completed the horrors of this chamber of de&s;pair and death, had not Henry, Den|ni&s;on, and Caroline, thrown them&s;elves be|tween the father and the &s;on. Unable, how|ever, for the moment, to &s;eparate the parent from the criminal, no oppo&s;ing force could prevent the noble and indignant youth from
<PB N="234" REF="242">dragging down Sir Gui&s;e on his knees, and &s;wearing by the angel-&s;pirit of his departed mother, that if he did not that in&s;tant be|&s;eech forgivene&s;s of the murdered &s;aint now &s;tretched before him, no power on earth &s;hould make him endure the &s;ight of him again, but he would brand him as the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the innocent, until the habitable earth &s;hould not contain a corner to &s;hield from &s;corn his opprobrious head.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, divided between the mi&s;creant emotions of fear and &s;hame, folded his hands together, and muttered &s;omething like a &s;or|row for what had happened; then being permitted to ri&s;e up, he &s;lunk, like a detect|ed robber, out of the room, attended by Denni&s;on and the phy&s;ician.</P>

<P>THUS died the excellent and gentle lady Stuart, and &s;uch were the events which hap|pened immediately after &s;he had expired.&mdash; Had &s;he lived an hour longer, her la&s;t mo|ments mu&s;t have been di&s;turbed by &s;cenes which, in her firme&s;t health, &s;he had neither &s;pirits nor &s;trength to &s;upport.&mdash;</P>
<P>Should the untimely fate of this lady have drawn from the reader, therefore, a tear of grief, another of con&s;olation will &s;ucceed; as he reflects that &s;he was then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to the realms of eternal re&s;t, amid&s;t the calm of innocence, the peace of virtue, and love of the good.</P>
<P>The next point we have to &s;ettle with the reader, is the unexpected appearance of Charles and Henry; to &s;atisfy him on which head, he mu&s;t be informed, that Henry having by letter acquainted his friend of the news that had been imparted to him, re|&s;pecting lady Stuart's declining health: Charles communicated the tidings to his
<PB N="236" REF="244">colonel, ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that though his duty, as an officer, was dear to him as his own life, the duty that he owed to, perhaps, a dying mother, was dearer &s;till; and that he verily believed de&s;ertion would follow refu&s;al of leave to attend her, unle&s;s at the time of &s;uch refu&s;al, he was put under an arre&s;t, which he intreated might be the ca&s;e, as the only means to &s;ecure him from a breach of duty. His colonel, touched with an ardour like his own, and di&s;daining to at|tend to the literal traits of a threat, which was &s;anctioned by its motive, and which tried not by martial law, but in the courts of humanity, might have almo&s;t ju&s;tified the offence it&s;elf, replied, "Take my hand, young &s;oldier, and with it, take not my con&s;ent only, but my command, to remain with your mother as long as your &s;ociety can admini&s;ter to her one comfortable moment; and if you return from your po&s;t &s;ooner, damn me, if I do not give my vote to have you broke&mdash;aye, and you would de&s;erve to be &s;hot more than any de&s;erter upon earth, and that for di&s;obedience as well of my
<PB N="237" REF="245">orders, as of tho&s;e of my &s;uperior, the great god of nature him&s;elf. And as to your ab&s;ence, were it even on the day of battle, my boy, by the god of war, I would fight with a &s;word in each hand, as your &s;ub&s;ti|tute; aye, and do you ju&s;tice too upon the enemy: &s;o march, my lad, and don't &s;tay any longer here to parley&mdash;but here's a letter, I received from a brother officer, which came to me a few po&s;ts ago, and in which you are concerned; you may read it on the road; time is now precious." Charles pre&s;&s;ed his colonel's hand to his glowing cheek, bowed, and di&s;appeared. Po&s;t|hor&s;es, and the travel of night and day, brought him with breathle&s;s ha&s;te in the twilight of the &s;econd day's journey, to the gate of the abbey, where being met by Henry, who was at that time taking his evening round of &s;olitary &s;orrow&mdash;"My friend," &s;aid Charles, alighting from his hor&s;e, "do I behold Henry Fitzorton?"&mdash; "O, Charles!" replied Henry, "this has been my night's &s;ojourn&mdash;the&s;e woods have
<PB N="238" REF="246">&s;o long received me, that I now &s;eem to be one of their natural inhabitants."</P>
<P>"Does my mother yet live?" demanded Charles, "and how is my poor &s;i&s;ter?" then, without waiting a reply, he took Henry by the hand, and would have thundered for admittance at the abbey door, had not the thought of the &s;ick lady Stuart intervened. He gave, therefore, a more gentle &s;ummons, which being luckily an&s;wered by Denni&s;on, who was, at that moment, &s;itting pen&s;ive in the cloi&s;ters of the grand entrance, "Help me, good old man," &s;aid Charles, "to a&s;cend the chamber of a dying mother, and of a &s;i&s;ter, who, I fear, alas!"&mdash;"Si&s;ter!" &s;aid the terror-&s;tricken Henry. He had nei|ther time nor breath to utter more, for Charles trembled like him&s;elf, at every &s;tep, as he pa&s;&s;ed the cloi&s;ters. At remote di&s;tances lamps were hung on the pillars; their foot|&s;teps reverberated a &s;ound that was porten|tous and &s;epulchral; the veteran, who accom|panied them, whi&s;pered, "le&s;s noi&s;e! dear young ma&s;ter, le&s;s noi&s;e!" and when the im|patient,
<PB N="239" REF="247">but tender youth, and his friend, had gained the back &s;tair-ca&s;e, Denni&s;on di&s;|appeared, and &s;ought Sir Gui&s;e, for the pur|po&s;e already related.</P>
<P>There remains but one circum&s;tance more, therefore, to be &s;ettled with the reader, and that is, the letter that Charles Stuart's worthy colonel gave that heroic youth at parting. This will be&s;t explain it&s;elf, as well as the parties concerned.</P>

<P>INDEED his hiding place was well fitted to the darkne&s;s of his &s;pirit, the da&s;tardy of his guilt, and the fears that are natural to both. It was &s;ituate in a part of the abbey, which, from being long untenanted, had fallen into decay, in&s;omuch, that the chatter of the daw, the croak of the toad, and the heavy wing of the raven, and of other birds that &s;eem to delight in the ruin of human grandeur and ambition, were heard through the broken apertures, which time, that great di&s;mantler of all the laboured towers of va|nity, had made in the walls. A number of &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages yawned, like cavern mouths, in different parts: gaps al&s;o were opened in its &s;ides, through which the wind emitted an hollow &s;ound, which was hoar&s;ely repeated by the affrighted echo&mdash;In ancient days, this gloomy rece&s;s had been, as re|cords te&s;tified, a place of &s;epulture: more|over,
<PB N="242" REF="250">it was damp and de&s;olate to &s;uch an extreme, that a chill like that of death ran through the blood as you entered it; in &s;hort, it was the la&s;t rece&s;s that Sir Gui&s;e, of all men, would have entered in the hours of darkne&s;s, had he not been driven into it by tho&s;e overwhelming terrors, which now &s;eized upon him.</P>
<P>Often did he look behind, as he traver&s;ed the long ailes that led to this Golgotha: and finding neither force nor flattery could get rid of the vigilant Denni&s;on, he &s;ubmitted to his entering, after drawing acro&s;s the door, which was knotted with enormous &s;tuds of iron, the ru&s;ty bolts, that terrified him.</P>
<P>Denni&s;on, who&s;e heart would have done honour to the mo&s;t exalted, even as it dig|nified the mo&s;t humble, &s;tation, began to feel towards his ma&s;ter a degree of pity; and, indeed, there is not, perhaps, in the whole world a more complete object of commi&s;er|ation, than an unhappy wretch, trembling under a thorough conviction of his own un|worthine&s;s, and flying from the man he has injured.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="251">The good Denni&s;on on perceiving Sir Gui&s;e in great terror, and rightly judging it mu&s;t be of his &s;on and Henry Fitzorton, a&s;&s;ured him, in a voice that even guilt it&s;elf, with all its train of &s;u&s;picions, mu&s;t have be|lieved, that he might make him&s;elf quite ea&s;y, as he had left both the young &s;quires in his poor dead lady's chamber;&mdash;"As for her," ob&s;erved Denni&s;on, "&s;he is now a &s;aint above all of us; &s;o all is for the be&s;t, and as &s;he could get no happine&s;s in life, I am glad &s;he is gone where &s;he is &s;ure to find it.

But all this is no matter, &s;he is in heaven, and you are here &s;kulking in this dirty corner&mdash; there's the difference; &s;o we have nothing to do but make the be&s;t of a bad matter; but as it would not be plea&s;ant to &s;leep in this old charnel, among&s;t owls, toads, and dead men's &s;kulls&mdash;what I have to &s;ay is, if you are afraid to meet young ma&s;ter, who, to be &s;ure, is as brave as a lion; &s;o is Mr. Henry,&mdash;why, I will engage to get them out of the way, and then come and let your honour know: I would not betray you, even if your honour was a murderer, and man's blood on your hand, if I once &s;aid the word. If a man's word cannot be taken, there's an end of him. Thus, you may get to your comfortable
<PB N="246" REF="254">bed, and matters will be blown over by the morning."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, had not his tongue been chained by his fears, and every limb in &s;ubjection to the idea that devoured him, would have &s;oon checked the&s;e effu&s;ions; but he now heard them without any interruption, and accepted the propo&s;al. "I know," &s;aid he, "you are to be depended on, Denni&s;on; and, as I do not choo&s;e to have any words with my &s;on, and as you well know what rea&s;on I have to di&s;like the Fitzortons, though Henry, I own, is the be&s;t of them:&mdash;Why, my good Denni&s;on, you may do as you mention; I am &s;ure, you would die rather than betray your ma&s;ter.

<P>"So any man might, Sir," quoth the Steward, "if I &s;aid it, even if a man ought to be hanged:" Denni&s;on, however, had, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, little left for the farther trial of his integrity, for he found his good-natured de&s;igns already anticipated by Caro|line. This Briti&s;h daughter, who&s;e filial virtues might well contend with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t celebrated one of older times, met Denni&s;on ju&s;t as he had regained the habit|able part of the abbey;&mdash;"Where is my father?" &s;he exclaimed; "I have &s;ought him wherever I thought it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould take refuge, but all in vain, and I am in ten thou&s;and terrors. Have you &s;een him? Is he &s;afe? I am almo&s;t di&s;tracted. Good God! where can he be gone&mdash;why do not you &s;peak?"</P>
<P>The rapidity and confu&s;ion with which &s;he uttered this, made it impo&s;&s;ible for Denni&s;on to edge in any thing like a reply until &s;he had done &s;peaking, and then the honourable
<PB N="248" REF="256">&s;truggle of a moment, betwixt the de&s;ire of his heart, to compo&s;e the fears of his young mi&s;tre&s;s, and the debate of his con&s;cience, whether he ought to do &s;o by a breach of his word, produced in Denni&s;on a &s;hort he&s;ita|tion, which Caroline interpreted the wor&s;t way; namely, his reluctance to tell what had happened to his ma&s;ter. This fear &s;o agitated her that the taper dropped extingui&s;hed from her hands, and &s;he her&s;elf would have fol|lowed it, had not the affrighted Denni&s;on called out&mdash;"He lives, dear my lady mi&s;|tre&s;s, he lives, and I will conduct you to him&mdash;You would not harm a worm&mdash;he will not be afraid of &s;uch an angel as you; only we mu&s;t not &s;ay any thing to young ma&s;ter and Mr. Fitzorton."</P>
<P>"They are &s;afe," replied Caroline, &s;ome|what recovered, de&s;iring Denni&s;on to lead on and never to &s;tand for light, but if any was wanted to fetch it afterwards.</P>
<P>"Permit your &s;ervant then, my lady," &s;aid Denni&s;on; "to be &s;o bold to take your hand and be your guide; I dare &s;ay, I can
<PB N="249" REF="257">make out the road, though I never took it above once or twice before in my life, and then in broad day, except ju&s;t now, for the hall, you know, is haunted, not that, I think, there is a gho&s;t on earth would choo&s;e &s;uch a fearful&s;ome place as that, and if he did I defy him;&mdash;for a guilty con&s;cience is wor&s;e than he, if he were the devil him&s;elf; and a man cannot get out of the way of that, no not in a &s;ummer's-day, &s;eeing he carries it about with him. Where that goes will he go; where that lodges will he lodge, as the &s;cripture &s;ays. And for that matter, ma&s;ter is but a timmer&s;ome bit of a gentleman, you know, and mayhap will wonder he came for to go to &s;uch a hobgoblin old nick of a&mdash; But that's his affair; and as for lights, why we are going, where, on &s;uch a night as this&mdash;do but hear how the rain beats, and the wind roars, through the&s;e old piaches&mdash;a torch could not &s;tand it; no, hardly; an' it were in an horn lantern."</P>
<P>All this time Denni&s;on, gently holding Caroline with one hand, and exploring his
<PB N="250" REF="258">way with the other, was retracing his former foot&s;teps&mdash;and Caroline at the end of his &s;peech, which though all in whi&s;per, vibrated back upon them hollow re&s;pon&s;es, exclaim|ed &mdash;"I care not for light or darkne&s;s, &s;o that you conduct me to my father!"</P>
<P>"Here then we have him, mi&s;s," &s;aid Denni&s;on, "for we have but to get through this alley, &s;o then into the court-yard, then pa&s;s the old tower, then into the back ruins, &s;o then by the broken draw-bridge, and leave Monk's moat, as we call him, to the right, until we come to the Abbot's Ba&s;on, &s;lip&s;ide which, is Deadmen's Corner, and there is ma&s;ter." "Deadmen's Corner! what! in the charnel-hou&s;e in the old buildings?" ex|claimed Caroline.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes, mi&s;s, my lady, there he is &s;ure enough&mdash;and glad enough he will be, I war|rant him, to get out by this time, for he had never a hat on his head, until, as I was com|ing out, I clapt mine on it: by the &s;ame token, it would not be ami&s;s, before we creep through this hole, which brings us into
<PB N="251" REF="259">the ruinations, to throw a bit of a covering over your &s;houlders."</P>
<P>The&s;e words he accompanied by the action &s;ugge&s;ted, and had his &s;urtout, which he al|ways wore &s;ummer and winter, in door and out, buttoned over her before &s;he could gue&s;s what he was about.</P>
<P>"God &s;ave thee, good mi&s;s!" &s;aid Den|ni&s;on, as they gained the open area, "did you &s;ee that fla&s;h of lightning?&mdash;Well, that will light us on a bit; we &s;hall have a fine clap of thunder roll after him, I warrant, pre&s;ently. Aye, there he comes&mdash;I told you &s;o&mdash;and how the wind whizzes the rain in one's face&mdash;&s;top a bit&mdash;Its clean, though coar&s;e, mi&s;s, I took him out of lavender, of my own drying, this morning&mdash;&s;weet as a ro&s;ey, an't he&mdash;"</P>
<P>The Steward was all this time fa&s;tening his handkerchief over Caroline's head&mdash;"Pull it, my lady, a little more over your pretty face," continued he, "in the way of a hood like; or &s;uppo&s;e now, you were to hold the two ends in your mouth in this-um fa&s;hion&mdash; by the &s;ame token, this is a terrible night at
<PB N="252" REF="260">&s;ea; but there's one who can take care of tho&s;e who travel by land or by water, you know; though I wi&s;h I had my hat upon your head, my lady mi&s;s, in&s;tead of where it is, too; for 'tis pity O' the world to wet &s;uch locks as the&s;e-um&mdash;alack! you are my lady|&s;hip now, more's the mis-hap, for my poor mi&s;tre&s;s, my lady that was, is all this time where no &s;torms nor tempe&s;ts can reach her: &s;he is far enough away, thank God, from &s;uch things."</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;entence is the only one in this harangue, or in its accompaniments, that appeared to divide the attention of Caroline from what &s;he was in pur&s;uit of:&mdash;neither thunder, lightning, the delay, length, or ruggedne&s;s of the way, nor the rain that fell upon her, notwith&s;tanding all hone&s;t Den|ni&s;on's precautions, were deemed worthy of her notice, but at the mention of her mo|ther's &s;ituation, a long and heavy &s;igh, as if from the bottom of her &s;oul, bur&s;t from her, and &s;he exclaimed, "Oh! God, Oh! God, never till we join in heaven, Denni&s;on, &s;hall we behold &s;uch another woman!"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="261">"That's a &s;ure thing, mi&s;s, and God forgive me, I was going to &s;ay, nor then neither, except your lady&s;hip's &s;elf&mdash;yet, with reverence, I might have &s;aid it too&mdash;for were there more angels than a body could count, you and &s;he &s;hall be among&s;t the fir&s;t of them&mdash;&s;o don't grieve, mi&s;s, any more.

<P>Saying this, Denni&s;on tapped at the door, which Sir Gui&s;e, on recognizing the voice, opened, and Denni&s;on entered, leading in Caroline.</P>

<P>A CONTINUED fla&s;hing of the light|ning, however, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the faint ap|proaches of the dawn, threw light enough upon them, to di&s;cover that the companion of Denni&s;on was habited as a man; Sir Gui&s;e, therefore, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his guilty fears, ea&s;ily magnified the poor unoffending Caroline either into his angry &s;on, Charles, or the vindictive Henry Fitzorton. Under this apprehen&s;ion, he &s;hrunk back to the farthe&s;t corner of the di&s;mal cell, and in a voice more fearful than the thunder that rattled over the ruins, cried out, "Villain! you have be|trayed me, and have brought either my hated enemy, or my own rebellious child, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me." "Your own child, &s;ure enough &s;he is," &s;aid Denni&s;on, "but I do not think &s;he would a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, as you call it, the gnat that &s;tung her pretty face; it is, mi&s;s Caroline, buttoned up in my old wea|therall, and by the &s;ame token, as the rain don't &s;eem to give over, I &s;hall make bold
<PB N="255" REF="263">with my hat off your honour's head, &s;eeing a man has a right to take his own wherever he can find it, and my old handkerchief that I have tied, you &s;ee, under madam's little chin, is hand&s;omely &s;oaked by this time."</P>
<P>While Denni&s;on was &s;aying this, Caroline had run to her father, and convinced him &s;he came in her accu&s;tomed character, as the me&s;&s;enger of peace, and took the hat, which Denni&s;on had transferred from father to daughter, and replaced it upon that head which le&s;s de&s;erved protection, tenderly ex|claiming, "For goodne&s;s &s;ake, my dear Sir, let me conduct you from this dreadful place to your own apartment, and do you go be|fore, Denni&s;on, and fetch a light"&mdash;"As to light, madam, as I told you before, we can have none but that which God &s;ends us, and mu&s;t e'en go back as we came, and for that matter, it lightens &s;o, you may &s;ee to pick a pin up, though between whiles, it is as dark as my hat."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e exclaimed, "I'll not &s;tir, I tell you, until Charles is in bed, and that fellow, to whom you, Caroline, have betrayed me,
<PB N="256" REF="264">and whom you brought into the abbey after you had forbidden him, is out of my hou&s;e."</P>
<P>Caroline now perceiving the nature of his fears, and of his mi&s;take, "a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;o far from being privy to Mr. Fitzorton's gaining entrance into the abbey, her &s;urprize was equal to her father's, on &s;eeing him in her poor mother's chamber.</P>
<P>"O, your honour, I can &s;et that right," &s;aid Denni&s;on. The good old man then re|lated the circum&s;tances of Henry's being brought in by Charles, in con&s;equence of a letter &s;ent by the former, re&s;pecting lady Stuart's dangerous &s;ickne&s;s, and other par|ticulars, with which the reader is already acquainted.</P>
<P>Cowardice it&s;elf, born, as it often is, of con&s;cious crimes, though in the ca&s;e of Sir Gui&s;e, it was a timid da&s;tardy of con&s;titution, aggravated by guilt, and, indeed, by every thing that pointed at per&s;onal danger, might have caught encouragement from &s;uch ex|planations, and &s;uch explainers. Sir Gui&s;e, therefore, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be conducted out of the Golgotha by his daughter, and
<PB N="257" REF="265">&s;oon regained the inhabited part of the abbey. Hearing from one of his &s;ervants, that Mr. Henry Fitzorton was gone home to the ca&s;tle, but that the captain had returned, and was gone to bed, he &s;tole up the back|&s;tairs on tiptoe to his own apartment, like a thief in the night, leaving Denni&s;on and his daughter to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves as they thought proper.</P>
<P>"If, my good Denni&s;on, you are not too wet and weary," &s;aid the gentle Caroline, as &s;he de&s;cended the &s;tairs from the apartment of her father, "if, indeed, you are not quite worn out, I wi&s;h you would betake your&s;elf to my brother's chamber door, and wait there until you hear him &s;tirring in the morn|ing, then do not fail to let me know before he can po&s;&s;ibly come down &s;tairs.&mdash;You will find me in my poor mother's apartment, which, alas! I have quitted too long; but you know, my good Denni&s;on, it has been unavoidable."&mdash;"Wet, and weary!" an|&s;wered Denni&s;on, "why if you will promi&s;e to put on &s;omething dry, and take a drop of &s;omething comfortable your&s;elf, and a bit of
<PB N="258" REF="266">a nap, I would &s;tand up to the chin for half a day in one of our old moats! I have got &s;ome rare &s;tingo, mi&s;s, in my clo&s;et here hard-by, will keep the cold out of your &s;to|mach curiou&s;ly, I warrant him a perfect cor|dial." &mdash;"I am glad you mentioned it," &s;aid Caroline, "a gla&s;s of it, may, perhaps, do my father good, after &s;tanding &s;o long in that mi&s;erable place: I will take it to him directly; and you know, Denni&s;on, you may at the &s;ame time carry another to my bro|ther, for he too has been expo&s;ing him&s;elf this &s;hocking night,&mdash;alas, I wi&s;h this had been mentioned before his&mdash;his&mdash;his&mdash;friend went out of the hou&s;e, for&mdash;though&mdash;Hen&mdash; Henry&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Henry Fitzorton has done &s;omething very much to di&s;plea&s;ure me, I don't bear him the lea&s;t ill will, Denni&s;on." "Ill will, mi&s;s! why you love him as well as you do the eyes in your head, and he the &s;ame! and both of you know it,&mdash;and I hope you will both come together yet&mdash;for all this. Don't you remember my poor lady's dying words about it?"</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="267">Denni&s;on, who the reader remembers al|ways held di&s;cour&s;e, and did bu&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ame time, had now unlocked his clo&s;et, and produced a goodly &s;tone bottle that promi&s;ed comfort, and while Denni&s;on was pouring &s;ome of its contents into a little gla&s;s that &s;tood be&s;ide it, and was its con&s;tant com|panion, he cried, "Mi&s;s, if you don't take off this thimbleful to the poor young gentle|man's health, neither my young nor my old ma&s;ter, &s;aving your pre&s;ence, &s;hall have a drop of it, if it were to &s;ave their lives! I am &s;ure," added he, holding it to Caroline's lips, "if Squire Henry did but know we were drinking his health, he would not mind the wet weather, no, not even if he had been drawn through an hor&s;e-pond.&mdash;I know what true love is, as well as either of you; but all this time you're in your damp cloaths, &s;o warm the in&s;ide fir&s;t with this, and then I promi&s;e to do as you de&s;ire."</P>
<P>While Caroline pre&s;&s;ed her lip on the gla&s;s, he &s;aid, "now remember, mi&s;s, you are drinking the health of young Squire Fitzorton."</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="268">Caroline &s;ighed, gave the good old man a pre&s;&s;ure of the hand, and begged him to pour out another gla&s;s for Sir Gui&s;e.&mdash;"Cer|tainly, mi&s;s," &s;aid he, "but not before I have done honour to your lady&s;hip's fir&s;t toa&s;t in this kind of manner," here he took off a bumper; and filling the gla&s;s a third time, Caroline took it to her father's chamber door, where, unable to gain admittance, though &s;he heard him move, and told her errand, &s;he was obliged to bring it back to Denni&s;on, who carried it to her brother, with charge, however, not to di&s;turb him if he appeared to be a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Thus they &s;eparated to their different occupations; Denni&s;on, who in Caroline's ab&s;ence had thrown on &s;ome dry cloaths, to keep guard at his young ma&s;ter's door, and Caroline to the corp&s;e of her dead mother.</P>

<P>WE mu&s;t there leave them awhile, in their re&s;pective &s;tations, to &s;ee what happened in lady Stuart's chamber, after it had been left in &s;uch di&s;order by Sir Gui&s;e, Caroline, Denni&s;on, and the phy&s;ician: for be&s;ides the intere&s;t which, we tru&s;t, the reader will now take in whatever concerns young Henry and his friend Charles, the amiable Caroline had concealed &s;everal matters which it is nece&s;|&s;ary, to the connection of the hi&s;tory, the reader &s;hould know.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after the young friends were left together, Charles was &s;o agitated by grief for the lo&s;s of his mother, and re&s;entment again&s;t his father, whom he looked upon as the entire author of her death; and the whole &s;cene appeared to Henry &s;o powerful an en|chantment, "that their eyes were, alternately, fa&s;tened upon the living and upon the dead, without &s;peech or motion. At length the tender-hearted Charles, as if no longer able to &s;upport the view, flung his arms around
<PB N="262" REF="270">his friend, and, looking on the corp&s;e, ex|claimed,&mdash; "O Henry! one of the &s;tronge&s;t ties of my life is there rent a&s;under; yet &s;hall not tho&s;e which remain be the more preci|ous? but you mu&s;t not con&s;ider this effu&s;ion of exce&s;&s;ive &s;orrow for the untimely, I fear the unnatural, fate of that excellent parent, as my weakne&s;s."</P>
<P>Henry, who was &s;ufficiently touched be|fore, now joined his &s;ighs and tears in generous &s;ympathy, but exhorted him to withdraw from the &s;ight.&mdash;"When I have pre&s;&s;ed upon this cold maternal lip one ki&s;s," continued Charles, "it &s;hall be &s;o;" in &s;tooping down to do which he di&s;covered the little ca&s;e out of which his &s;i&s;ter had taken the miniatures which, as the reader already knows, &s;he had &s;afely depo&s;ited. The cabinet &s;till remained; and in the confu&s;ion of lady Stuart's la&s;t moments, or perhaps from de&s;ign, it had got between her face and her pillow, and in that &s;ituation was it found by Charles. And now a di&s;covery was made, which threw Henry into a &s;tate impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe; for the miniatures of his beloved Caroline,
<PB N="263" REF="271">and of his friend Charles, were at the bottom of the cabinet; and as the excellent mother did not bequeath the&s;e to her daughter, or even mention them with that of her&s;elf, or tho&s;e of her parents, &s;he probably de&s;igned to have had them buried with her. Henry being unable to &s;peak, looked tho&s;e unutter|able wi&s;hes, which Charles ea&s;ily interpreted, exclaiming, "Yes, deare&s;t of my friends! they &s;hall be yours! both yours! does not the &s;ituation in which I found them, &s;eem to whi&s;per to us, that they received a mother's ble&s;&s;ing with her late&s;t breath?"</P>
<P>Henry took the miniatures with a trem|bling hand, and pre&s;&s;ing them to his lips, put them ha&s;tily into his bo&s;om, &s;aying only, "this is their proper man&s;ion, they are here at home." "But where," exclaimed Charles, "is the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of our peace? that inhuman, I will not outrage the &s;acred name by calling him father! where has his atrocious guilt hid it&s;elf from his de&s;olated, his degraded &s;on? He has murdered my mother, and is making my &s;i&s;ter cruel as him&s;elf: perhaps &s;he is
<PB N="264" REF="272">now protecting him from my ju&s;t and pious indignation!"</P>
<P>"If the memory of your decea&s;ed mo|ther, who&s;e &s;pirit may, perhaps, be now di&s;turbed in heaven it&s;elf, by the knowledge of our indecent ill-timed contentions, be dear my friend," &s;aid Henry, "do not attempt to find Sir Gui&s;e, whatever a&s;ylum he may have cho&s;en, while the &s;acred corp&s;e of your dear mother is yet in the chamber that gave you and Caroline birth! rather, ah! rather aid her, to perform the la&s;t &s;ad offices with filial decency and chri&s;tian re&s;ignation."</P>
<P>Charles melted as he heard,&mdash;and em|bracing his friend, "Well," &s;aid the generous youth, "it &s;hall be &s;o; I will try to conduct my&s;elf in every thing at this awful cri&s;is, as your piety &s;ugge&s;ts. Were it not for my &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake," continued the lieutenant, "I would leave the hou&s;e this moment, never to return; and, indeed, it is not &s;afe, my friend, for me to remain here any longer at pre&s;ent: &s;hould I meet with the author of all our mi&s;eries, I fear neither the living nor the dead
<PB N="265" REF="273">will make me remember my promi&s;es." In this di&s;po&s;ition Charles and Henry left the abbey.</P>
<P>Caroline re-entered her mother's apart|ment at midnight, when addre&s;&s;ing the at|tendants who were &s;itting up with the body, &s;he &s;aid &s;he cho&s;e now to undertake that office her&s;elf, and de&s;ired they might go to re&s;t. The reader is &s;ufficiently acquainted with the mind of Caroline Stuart to know, that the dutiful oppo&s;ition which was made to this, on the part of the &s;ervants, effected no change in her de&s;igns, though it received the kinde&s;t acknowledgment. One of the chambermaids intreated &s;he might &s;it by the corp&s;e of her dear lady, prote&s;ting &s;he would lay down her life to re&s;tore her. "And if my young mi&s;tre&s;s will go to bed," ex|claimed another, "I will engage not to have a wink of &s;teep get into my eyes for a month, if my mi&s;tre&s;s's precious remains could be pre&s;erved above ground."</P>
<P>When Caroline was left alone, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf by the &s;ide of her bed, without any of the ordinary terrors on being in the room
<PB N="266" REF="274">with the dead. Various are the in&s;tances we have already given the reader, of her extra|ordinary &s;trength of mind. It was that alone, which enabled her to &s;upport the fatigues and mi&s;eries of the pa&s;t memorable &s;cenes; and it now a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to perform other offices which her love &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The pride of female youth, even as it was di&s;played in the redundant locks of Caroline, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed not tho&s;e beautiful tre&s;&s;es which &s;till adorned her mother. Caroline pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in adju&s;ting the&s;e with as much care, though with the &s;tricte&s;t homage to nature, as if her mother were alive. She parted them, &s;pread them over the &s;houlders, di&s;po&s;ed them into ringlets, talked to them, pre&s;&s;ed them to her lips, and bathed them with her tears. Looking earne&s;tly in her mother's face, &s;he could &s;ometimes fancy &s;he was about to &s;peak. She perceived the &s;mile which Denni&s;on had &s;o artle&s;sly celebrated, &s;till impre&s;&s;ed: at length, &s;he confined the hair under a &s;imple veil of white crape, as her mother had directed, and after a thou&s;and other tenderne&s;&s;es,&mdash;which, if the reader has
<PB N="267" REF="275">not a heart to take an intere&s;t in, we can only condole with or congratulate him upon it, which he likes be&s;t&mdash;&s;he felt her&s;elf weighed down by the different occurrences of the night, and taking her mother's cold hand in her own, &s;he lay down by her &s;ide, and fell into a &s;ounder &s;leep, than, it is probable, her guilty father had enjoyed during the night.</P>
<P>The &s;un and Charles Stuart ro&s;e together, and the tru&s;ty Denni&s;on came to the door of his lady's apartment to announce,&mdash;&s;aying, "My young ma&s;ter is &s;tirring, madam, and on ringing his bell, I went my&s;elf to receive his orders, which were to get his hor&s;es ready, and &s;end up his boots and &s;purs immediately; &s;o, calling his own man to do the&s;e things, I came, as promi&s;ed, to let you know it, mi&s;s;&mdash;and here you have never had your clothes off I &s;ee, and I &s;uppo&s;e have been lying by the &s;ide of my poor lady all this time; aye, here is the length of ye; and I can &s;ee you have ju&s;t let go that cold hand. For that matter, my young ma&s;ter had but a weari&s;ome time of it any more than your&s;elf; I heard him very re&s;tle&s;s, and taking on
<PB N="268" REF="276">pitiou&s;ly, for I did not budge an inch, and he called out by times upon his mother and your&s;elf, mi&s;s, and Squire Henry; and once I heard him &s;ay, poor Denni&s;on! More than all, he mentioned the name of Olivia, which, as I take it, is the name of the young lady now come down again to pa&s;s the &s;ummer with her father at the manor-hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Olivia!" &s;aid Caroline, "what Olivia Clare! &s;ince our infant days we have not met, alas! we then were tender friends; but I have heard &s;he is&mdash;" "as pretty a crea|ture, they tell me," interpo&s;ed Denni&s;on, "as your&s;elf, mi&s;s. Yes, my young ma&s;ter mentioned her, and &s;ighed &s;o between whiles that, for my part, I believe&mdash;yet, for certain if it is &s;o, its a &s;ecret, or el&s;e we &s;hould, &s;ome of us, have heard of it. I remember I my&s;elf was given to talk about my love before any body el&s;e knew any thing of the matter. By this you will &s;ay I mu&s;t be a blabbing old fellow to tell you of it, and I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o too, only I look upon you to be another him|&s;elf, as I may &s;ay, and, mayhap, may &s;tand
<PB N="269" REF="277">his friend in this affair; for, you know, if he &s;hould have taken a fancy to this mi&s;s Olivia, &s;eeing our hou&s;e and theirs do not &s;et their hor&s;es' heads very well together, there will be a fine coil, &s;peciou&s;ly as we are papi&s;hes, and they are prote&s;tants, you know, mi&s;s."</P>
<P>Denni&s;on, who though he had the garrulity of age, and loved a long &s;tory at his heart, had, al&s;o, the active diligence of youth. He contrived his narrations &s;o as to recite them, and do other bu&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ame time; in &s;o much, that he would frequently carry on a debate, or continue a &s;tory for miles to|gether; and, according to the given di&s;tance, compre&s;s his facts and effu&s;ions &s;o as to fini&s;h his harangue and his errand together, or rather, to end his harangue where his errand begun; and when this could not be done, he would break his &s;tory off &s;hort, with a pro|mi&s;e to give you the re&s;t another time; a promi&s;e which he would always &s;ooner or later fulfil, taking it up at the very &s;entence, and &s;ometimes with the very word which he left off, as if no interruption had happened, pre|facing, it only, "and &s;o as I was &s;aying;"
<PB N="270" REF="278">and would then proceed, either until he had done, or met with a &s;econd interruption.</P>
<P>The foregoing harangue was performed by Denni&s;on, almo&s;t at full &s;peed; for the in&s;tant Caroline was informed of her brother's pre|paring to ride out, at &s;o early an hour, &s;he ha&s;tened down &s;tairs, followed by our orator, and met the lieutenant ju&s;t as he was leaving his apartment. They &s;aluted each other with all the tenderne&s;s of affection; &s;oon after which, Charles de&s;ired to &s;peak with his &s;i&s;ter alone, and, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Denni&s;on, took her by the hand and walked into the garden, which &s;eparated the ca&s;tle from the park. "I mu&s;t leave the abbey, my dear Caroline," &s;aid Charles; "I feel there is no other way to ob&s;erve tho&s;e decorums which the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the family require. I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with another &s;ight of my poor mother's remains, much le&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;t at that ceremony which &s;hall convey them to the cold grave; neither dare I, in the pre&s;ent di&s;order of my mind, hazard the pre&s;ence of one to who&s;e account I continue to &s;et down not only the lo&s;s of a mother, but the mi&s;ery which
<PB N="271" REF="279">my &s;i&s;ter continues to inflict upon my bo&s;om friend; but I feel al&s;o, that the pre&s;ent is no time for inve&s;tigations of this &s;ort; lady Stuart claims all your attention, the more e&s;pecially, as, for the rea&s;ons I have men|tioned, I mu&s;t transfer to you my &s;hare of the la&s;t duties I owe to her, or rather include mine in yours. Alas! Caroline, there are other motives which make it expedient for me to quit this hou&s;e, and this neighbour|hood for a time, though never has it been more intere&s;ting or dear to me than at this moment. Do not a&s;k for explanations until we meet again."&mdash;"But where are you go|ing?" &s;aid Caroline. "To my regiment," an&s;wered Charles. "Independent of other rea&s;ons, the duty I owe the kind-hearted colonel ought to ha&s;ten my return; the leave he granted me, extended only to the moment in which I could give comfort to my mother. That moment, alas! is expired with her, and I mu&s;t never more behold!"&mdash;Charles was unable to proceed; and, tenderly em|bracing his &s;i&s;ter, went ha&s;tily towards a gate
<PB N="272" REF="280">that led to the &s;tables, and mounting his hor&s;e rode away.</P>
<P>Although the &s;ociety of &s;uch a brother would, at &s;o aweful a period, have been in the highe&s;t degree acceptable to &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter; although, likewi&s;e, the idea which Denni&s;on had &s;tarted, re&s;pecting his attachment to Olivia, and his own ob&s;ervation that there were "other motives" which made it ex|pedient for him to quit the abbey, created a new intere&s;t for him in her heart; the rea|&s;ons he urged, added to &s;ome others which her own mind &s;ugge&s;ted, reconciled her to his departure. As &s;oon, therefore, as he was gone, &s;he went back to Denni&s;on, who an|ticipated the que&s;tion &s;he began to a&s;k, by ob&s;erving, that Sir Gui&s;e had rung his bell, to know whether his &s;on was come down &s;tairs, and if not, to get his own hor&s;e brought round to the green lane at the back of the abbey wall.</P>
<P>Without waiting any reply, Caroline made the be&s;t of her way to a&s;k her father where he would be plea&s;ed to have breakfa&s;t, as her
<PB N="273" REF="281">brother being under the nece&s;&s;ity to return to his regiment, had &s;et off early, leaving her to perform his duty where it was due.</P>
<P>Hereupon Sir Gui&s;e, who affected bravery when he thought him&s;elf out of danger, and who&s;e imperious nature never knew re&s;traint but from his fears, cried out with pretended anger, even though the tidings were ju&s;t &s;uch as his pu&s;illanimous &s;oul could have wi&s;hed, rather than have expected, "Gone! me|thinks he might have &s;taid at lea&s;t until his mother was in her grave, if he paid no re|&s;pect to me! Is this your fine brother? but no matter, I &s;ee what you are all at: you may order breakfa&s;t in the library, and I will come down, and, do you hear, let the groom put up my hor&s;es, I &s;hall not go out yet."&mdash; The truth is, this da&s;tardly man, after quak|ing in his bed for &s;ome hours, and fancying he heard an enemy in every gu&s;t of wind that forced its pa&s;&s;age into his room, ro&s;e up with an intention of e&s;caping the &s;till dreaded vengeance of Charles, by taking &s;helter in the chapel-hou&s;e of father Ar|thur,
<PB N="274" REF="282">of whom we &s;hall pre&s;ently make honourable mention.</P>
<P>The good prie&s;t was an univer&s;al peace|maker, and well de&s;erved the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s promi&s;ed to per&s;ons of that character, as will be more fully evinced in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory. The Baronet intended to employ this worthy Monk, as he had done on former occa&s;ions, in a treaty betwixt father and &s;on. The departure of the &s;on, however, made, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, interce&s;&s;ions of this kind unnece&s;&s;ary; and in due time, Sir Gui&s;e re&s;umed his haughty character in the fami|ly, and dealt his commands about him with as little di&s;may as if nothing had hap|pened.</P>

<P>AFFAIRS at the abbey being now placed in as quiet a po&s;ture as circum&s;tances would admit, we may leave it awhile to &s;ee what befel the family at the ca&s;tle. The anxieties there augmented with tho&s;e of Henry, who&s;e very frequent &s;eparations, for whole nights together, and the ab&s;ence or agitation of his mind upon his return, &s;till evading explanation, yet &s;till wi&s;hing to ex|plain, alarmed his friends.</P>
<P>Mean time the health of Olivia fell a martyr to her apprehen&s;ions, which tortured her ince&s;&s;antly with the dread of a thou&s;and evils, and among&s;t others, the total over|throw of Henry's &s;en&s;es; an opinion which his &s;trange demeanour &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified. On the night of lady Stuart's death, Olivia could not be di&s;&s;uaded from a pre&s;entiment that &s;omething fatal had happened to him; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of which notion, &s;he refu&s;ed taking any repo&s;e; and, terrible as was the night, ill as &s;he was in her own health, &s;he intreated
<PB N="276" REF="284">her father to &s;uffer her to &s;it up and wait his coming home. Her father in vain offered to be him&s;elf her &s;ub&s;titute, and to bring her an account the moment of his arrival. John and the re&s;t of the family made the like offer, propo&s;ing that Mr. Clare, who&s;e age and infirmities were daily increa&s;ing, &s;hould go to re&s;t. This he peremptorily refu&s;ed, &s;ay|ing, "a night's &s;leep was le&s;s to him than they &s;uppo&s;ed;" adding, "that &s;ince his child's illne&s;s, though he had gone to bed at his u&s;ual hour, he had &s;eldom clo&s;ed his eyes."&mdash;"I will retire this in&s;tant, Sir," replied Olivia, "if that will contribute to your re&s;t."&mdash;"No, my dear," rejoined her father, "wrap your&s;elf up warm, and I &s;hall &s;tand a better chance of &s;leeping in this arm-chair by the &s;ide of my Olly, than in the be&s;t bed in the world out of her com|pany." The conclu&s;ion of the matter was, that none of the family went to bed, except Sir Armine, who had been for &s;ome time indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>In de&s;pite of the be&s;t endeavours, how|ever, to quiet the fears of Olivia, they
<PB N="277" REF="285">vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed with the delay. She ran to the door on the lea&s;t noi&s;e. The thunder and lightning &s;erved only to confirm her apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome accident had hap|pened, &s;till repeating, that if there had not, he certainly would have come. In this way, the time pa&s;&s;ed until his actual arrival. When he came into the apartment where the com|pany were waiting,&mdash;orders being left with a &s;ervant who attended at the ca&s;tle gate for that purpo&s;e,&mdash;the con&s;ternation both of Henry and Charles, who, the reader remem|bers, went out of the abbey with him, was not le&s;s at &s;eeing the family &s;till up, than was theirs at ob&s;erving the condition in which they now appeared:&mdash;"I told you &s;o," &s;aid Olivia, running to Henry, "My fears were but too true. Good heavens! what has been the matter? tell me, Mr. Stuart, what has befallen your friend?"</P>
<P>Though Charles could not but feel that Olivia wholly overlooked his own &s;ituation, in her anxiety for that of her beloved Henry, he ha&s;tened to relieve her terrors, by telling her, that his ble&s;&s;ed mother, lady Stuart, had
<PB N="278" REF="286">died that night; that at his reque&s;t, Henry had exerted his friend&s;hip to admini&s;ter con|&s;olation to the family, under the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that fatal event.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Olivia, taking the hand of Charles, "I forget all that Henry has made me &s;uffer from his ab&s;ence, &s;ince it was in &s;o righteous a cau&s;e: my little cares are lo&s;t in the contemplation of yours." Fearing &s;he &s;hould, by dwelling on the theme, augment his &s;orrows, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand to her cheek, which was wet with her tears, and then ran to her own father, as to a trea&s;ure held on a tenure &s;o precarious, that &s;he trembled even as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. "You may now repo&s;e, my deare&s;t father," whi&s;|pered &s;he, ca&s;ting a look of affection on Henry, and of pity on Charles, while, with un&s;peakable tenderne&s;s, &s;he conducted her father out of the room.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by his friend for Henry's late ab&s;ences, tended greatly not only to recover Olivia's health, but to re|&s;tore the family tranquillity; and when on his interview with Sir Armine the next day,
<PB N="279" REF="287">he was commended for his care of his friend's family, but blamed for a neglect of his own. Olivia, who though ever the greate&s;t &s;uf|ferer by his ab&s;ence, was always the fir&s;t to excu&s;e it, turned even this heavy charge to his advantage, by &s;aying, "Dear &s;ir, if we had all of us endured ten times more, his motive ought to &s;anctify his omi&s;&s;ion: he knew how much greater grief we &s;hould have undergone, had he told us he was &s;o often at the abbey attending the &s;ick, and under the roof of the mi&s;taken Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, though you now &s;ee his friend&s;hip for Charles exacted his attendance; and for my own part, &s;o far as I have been a lo&s;er by being deprived of his &s;ociety, I declare I &s;hould have loved him a little the le&s;s if he had not attended:&mdash;though, I mu&s;t own, if ever he is called again to a&s;&s;i&s;t at &s;uch &s;evere and &s;olemn duties, I &s;hould wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible for Olivia to be &s;o far in his confi|dence, that &s;he might be his nur&s;e and com|forter while he is nur&s;ing and comforting others, and then you know I might contrive to make &s;ome little bird tell the re&s;t of the
<PB N="280" REF="288">family where he was, and what he was doing, in a &s;ort of way that would prevent them from being under any apprehen&s;ions."</P>
<P>Thus did this innocent girl throw a lu&s;tre about the very my&s;teries of the man &s;he loved;&mdash;thus furni&s;h an apology, uncon&s;cious that it was again&s;t her&s;elf, out of the un&s;u&s;|picious goodne&s;s of her own mind, and the almo&s;t unequalled tenderne&s;s of her own heart. It was, neverthele&s;s, with &s;ecret an|gui&s;h &s;he beheld the effects which the late exertions had upon Henry's health and &s;pi|rits; the mu&s;e and even her&s;elf neglected; and though &s;he &s;ub&s;cribed to the nece&s;&s;ity of his obeying his friend Charles, re&s;pecting lady Stuart's funeral, &s;he &s;aw the day ap|proach with an anxiety not to be de&s;cribed, well knowing how &s;incere a mourner Henry's gentle nature would make him on that oc|ca&s;ion. Thinking, therefore, that her pre|&s;ence would &s;erve two gracious purpo&s;es, that of dividing the office of her beloved Henry, and &s;oftening the grief of his friend's &s;i&s;ter, in who&s;e favour &s;he ever retained an intere&s;t, founded not only on the memory of
<PB N="281" REF="289">carly attachment, but on what &s;he had heard of her filial piety, &s;he watched her be&s;t opportunity to offer her &s;ervices, which were tendered fir&s;t to her own father, and then to Sir Armine, with a grace &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that had not an increa&s;e of her own indi&s;po&s;ition, on the night preceding the ceremony inter|cepted her de&s;ign, Olivia Clare would in|evitably have met Caroline Stuart; and in &s;o doing both would probably have returned home, in de&s;pite of the aweful &s;cene at which they would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with &s;en&s;ations of angui&s;h never felt by either of them be|fore.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;carce le&s;s difficulty to get rid of the importunity of John, who wi&s;hing, as he &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, "to make a proper di&s;tinction betwixt the amiable dead, and the infamous living," and think|ing, moreover, it would be a fit occa&s;ion of paying a compliment to a brother officer in di&s;tre&s;s, declared his intention to accompany Henry on the morrow. From this dilemma, however, he was al&s;o re|lieved
<PB N="282" REF="290">by a me&s;&s;age from his father, de|&s;iring John to in&s;pect &s;ome family papers which required di&s;patch; and thus was he re&s;cued from a di&s;covery, which would have been &s;carce le&s;s fatal to his &s;ecret, than if it had been detected by Olivia.&mdash;James forbore to multiply her perplexity by an offer of him&s;elf in the place of John, be|cau&s;e he &s;aw plainly, though without at all knowing the rea&s;on, that Henry preferred going alone.</P>
<P>And well it is, perhaps, for all that he did go &s;o unattended; for &s;uch circum|&s;tances pa&s;t on the evening of the funeral, as even Henry him&s;elf was by no means prepared to encounter or expect.</P>

<P>THE ceremony was performed at a &s;mall Catholic chapel belonging to the abbey, but detached from that edifice about a quarter of a mile, in a rece&s;s of the fore&s;t. In times of old, there had been a &s;ubterra|neous pa&s;&s;age from the abbey to this little chapel, which had been the family burial-place for many ages. It was awefully picture&s;que. Within a few paces was a building, who&s;e architecture denoted the &s;ame antiquity, and had been the re&s;idence of the family prie&s;ts time immemorial. It was now the dwelling of father Arthur, a Monk of the order of St. Francis, and though he often made excur&s;ions to the metropolis, where his duty, as well as his affections called him, he would, &s;ometimes, take refuge from the world in this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, which he rented of Sir Gui&s;e, to who&s;e family he admini&s;tered whenever he was in the country. As this extraordinary per&s;onage will, as we have already announced, be fre|quently
<PB N="284" REF="292">under the view of the reader, we cannot take a better occa&s;ion than the pre|&s;ent, of entering into a few particulars re|&s;pecting his life, conver&s;ation, and character.</P>
<P>This di&s;tingui&s;hed Capuchin was de&s;cended from an ancient and once powerful family in the kingdom of Ireland; but, in the revolu|tions of that country, had long been deprived of hereditary property, in common with many other illu&s;trious names.&mdash;The per&s;onal fortune, however, of his parents, enabled them to give their &s;on a private education; and to &s;end him into foreign countries to extend his knowledge, as the po&s;&s;ibility of further improvement was denied him in his own, through the de&s;poti&s;m of penal laws.</P>
<P>Having completed his &s;tudies, he di&s;|covered in his mind a &s;trong bias to a reli|gious life, and indulged it by entering into the communion of the holy order of Saint Francis. On his ordination, he was appointed chaplain to a regiment, but was removed, and forfeited a pen&s;ion, becau&s;e he would not comply with the requi&s;ition of a foreign &s;overeign, to enli&s;t in his &s;ervice the &s;ubjects
<PB N="285" REF="293">of the king of his own country: a practice which had continued &s;ince the formation of a code of &s;tatutes which prohibited them from the military &s;ervice of their own monarch.</P>
<P>It has been recorded, that the dei&s;t, the enthu&s;ia&s;t, the bigot, the tyrant who u&s;urps the right to controul the con&s;ciences of free born men, and to puni&s;h them for their mental errors, flew ever at the approach of father Arthur: a Moliere, when he laughs;&mdash; a Locke, when he rea&s;ons;&mdash;a Tully, when he writes;&mdash;a Tillot&s;on, when he exhorts. And in regard to his religious tenets, his own language, &s;o well calculated to adorn the energy of truth with the charms of elo|quence, has told us, that he con&s;idered him|&s;elf as an advocate pleading for the prote&s;tant in France, and for the Jew in Li&s;bon, as well as for the catholic in Ireland; exhorting mankind, at the &s;ame time, to let religious di&s;tinctions be laid a&s;ide, &s;ince it was equal to the I&s;raelite relea&s;ed from bondage, whe|ther his temple was built by Solomon or by Cyrus, provided he had liberty to pray un|mole&s;ted, and to &s;leep under his own vine.&mdash;
<PB N="286" REF="294">Enforcing this with an apo&s;trophe, which, for its benevolence and pure truth, ought to be engraven upon the tablet of every heart. "Let not the &s;acred name of religion, which even in the face of an enemy, di&s;covers a brother, be any longer a wall of &s;eparation to keep us a&s;under! though it has been often perverted to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es, yet it is ea&s;y to reconcile it to every &s;ocial ble&s;|&s;ing."</P>
<P>Father Arthur connected the wi&s;dom of the world with the innocence of pa&s;toral, and even of primitive manners. His benevolence was of the mo&s;t unaffected kind; his piety fervid and &s;incere; his manners the mo&s;t winning and artle&s;s; anticipating his good will and urbanity before he opened his lips; and when they were opened, his ex|pre&s;&s;ions did but ratify what tho&s;e manners had before en&s;ured. And you had a farther earne&s;t of this in the benign and inffable &s;mile of a countenance &s;o little practi&s;ed in guile, that it at the &s;ame time invited to con|fidence, and denoted an impo&s;&s;ibility of your being betrayed. But if his &s;mile beckoned
<PB N="287" REF="295">the worthy to approach, his frown &s;truck terror into the heart of the guilty, and made him dread to advance. Sir Gui&s;e had more than once felt its potency. His voice was &s;onorous, bold, and nervous, corre&s;ponding with the manly and &s;terling &s;en&s;e it imparted. He had &s;tudied with labour, and written with ea&s;e and energy. His rea&s;oning was &s;ound, and his love of liberty a &s;teady light, rather than a tran&s;ient blaze; rather the vital prin|ciple of an hone&s;t mind, con&s;cious of its rights, than the ravings of a factious &s;pirit, infected by popular frenzy. All he &s;aid and all he did was genuine, even to his mo&s;t tri|fling &s;ports. The reader will therefore pre|judge the zeal of his devotion. It was glowing, without papi&s;tic rage; and earne&s;t, without catholic prejudice.</P>
<P>Our re&s;pectable Franci&s;can di&s;covered the cloy&s;ter only in his dre&s;s and deportment; not that the fir&s;t exhibited his gown of coar&s;e &s;erge, his cord, or his ro&s;ary, but, that his out-of-fa&s;hion &s;uit of &s;ables hung upon him &s;omewhat mona&s;tically; and the latter was &s;tately and inflexible enough to have cha|racteri&s;ed
<PB N="288" REF="296">the fellow of one of our colleges. He was nearly &s;ix feet high; a perfect per|pendicular, with a kind of rigour in his mu&s;|cles that &s;eemed to &s;uffer from bending. There was, of cour&s;e, a formality in his bows; and this, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, extended to his addre&s;s; but an original vein of hu|mour, and quaint jocularity, rendered him gay with the &s;prightly, in the &s;ame propor|tion that his more &s;olid powers made him &s;edate with the grave; it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;i|ble to meet a per&s;on &s;o univer&s;ally acceptable to all ranks of people. His &s;ociety was &s;ought, and appreciated, by men and women of all per&s;ua&s;ions; and his life, in all its changes, from the Monk in his cell to the man of the world, from the &s;ocial friend to the &s;olitary reclu&s;e, had been &s;o un&s;potted, and blamele&s;s, that to boa&s;t an acquaintance with pere Arthur was an honour; and to po&s;&s;e&s;s that honour without love and vene|ration, impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The little romantic &s;cene in which this dome&s;tic chapel, and its neighbouring habi|tation were &s;ituate, with the profe&s;&s;ional
<PB N="289" REF="297">duties annexed, were among&s;t the fir&s;t grati|fications of his innocent heart; and &s;uch was his predilection for it, that he was wont to con&s;ider his migrations to the great city as his wanderings into the world, and the chapel-hou&s;e as his home.</P>
<P>He had highly revered the character of lady Stuart and her daughter, to &s;ooth the anxious hours of whom, he would often &s;teal at twilight from his beloved chapel-hou&s;e, and pa&s;s his evening at the abbey; taking care, however, even in the bo&s;om of chear|fulne&s;s, never to out&s;tay the twelfth hour; and if he could ever be prevailed on to re|main in company after the clock had &s;truck that pre&s;cribed period, which he u&s;ed to &s;ay, was dividing the day from the morrow, it was only when, by &s;uch an infraction on his general rule, he could be of &s;ome &s;ervice to the party that detained him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>THE chapel-hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of four &s;mall apartments, a dormitory and &s;crip|torum above; an eating room, and kitchen below. The windows were adorned with paintings from &s;acred hi&s;tory: every pane containing &s;ome figure or fragment of holy writ, of exqui&s;ite colouring and delineation. Within the chapel were carved with curious workman&s;hip, various effigies and repre|&s;entations of our Saviour, and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, all which as well as every other part of this dwelling, were kept by father Arthur, and that of his Indian a&s;&s;ociate,&mdash;to whom we promi&s;e the reader an introduction,&mdash; with a religious care, te&s;tifying that the good man believed and inculcated that text which pronounces cleanline&s;s to be in alliance with holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The chapel it&s;elf, though certainly erected at the time of the abbey, was compleat and in high pre&s;ervation. The traditional hi&s;tory
<PB N="291" REF="299">of the place told us, that the chapel was intended for the private devotion of the principal abbot, and the chapel-hou&s;e, if not for his con&s;tant re&s;idence, for his occa|&s;ional religious retirement; and this, indeed, &s;eemed the more likely, as the names of &s;ome of the chief monks were &s;till legible in the carving about the dwelling; and the name of Stuart was yet to be &s;een on four of the mo&s;t ancient tombs. The burial|place, however, appropriated to the late and pre&s;ent branches of the Stuart family, was &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the building by a railing of iron, defending it round; upon your gaining the in&s;ide of which,&mdash;this rail|ing being intended for no other purpo&s;e than to encircle the con&s;ecrated &s;pot,&mdash;you de|&s;cended a flight of marble &s;teps until you came to the door of the grand mau&s;oleum, in which were depo&s;ited the remains of the Stuarts for the three la&s;t generations, ranged according to the dates of their decea&s;e. All this was now laid open and every preparation made for the burial of lady Stuart, who had de&s;ired the ceremony might be performed
<PB N="292" REF="300">with the utmo&s;t privacy, none attending but &s;uch of her own family as cho&s;e to be pre|&s;ent, in obedience to which her duteous daughter had given the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions, a&s;&s;embling all the dome&s;tics about an hour before the time appointed for the ceremony, and enjoining &s;uch as attended to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to deport them&s;elves with that de|cency and quiet which their mi&s;tre&s;s had required; but, as the choice of attending or not was left with them&s;elves, it was a plea&s;ing proof of that re&s;pect which was borne to the dead, to &s;ee that every &s;ervant of the family, from Denni&s;on to the mo&s;t menial attendant, had prepared to pay their la&s;t duty to one who&s;e memory &s;o well merited their vene|ration. And this in&s;tance of it was the more genuine, as the decea&s;ed had it not in her power to make &s;uch arrangements at her death, as her generous heart would have prompted. Indeed, it was not without &s;ome management, &s;he left mourning to Denni&s;on, and tho&s;e others of the family whom &s;he nominated as bearers. And even this would have been beyond her ability, &s;o mercenary
<PB N="293" REF="301">was the wretch to who&s;e affluent fortunes &s;he had largely contributed, had it not been for Caroline, who, after mu&s;tering up all the forces of her own &s;lender pur&s;e, and finding them in&s;ufficient, re&s;orted to Denni&s;on for a re-inforcement, in&s;i&s;ting, at the &s;ame time, upon depo&s;iting &s;ome of her mo&s;t valuable trinkets, as &s;ecurity again&s;t any accident to her&s;elf; "And then, my good Denni&s;on," &s;aid &s;he, "I can truly &s;ay it came from my father, in who&s;e &s;ervice, you know, it was acquired. Sir Gui&s;e him&s;elf," added &s;he, "may not like, in this time of our affliction, to be vexed about money matters; and as I heard my mother expre&s;s her wi&s;hes ye&s;ter|day, &mdash;alas! ye&s;terday, you know, &s;he was alive!&mdash;that &s;he could leave &s;ome little token of her good will to the &s;ervants, perhaps, &s;he might like to extend the bounty to &s;ome others."</P>
<P>All oppo&s;ition on the part of Denni&s;on, as to the depo&s;it, was fruitle&s;s, although &s;he knew that the gains of his pa&s;t, and the fer|vitude of his future life, would have been joyfully &s;urrendered to her di&s;po&s;al. This
<PB N="294" REF="302">tran&s;action happened before, the arrival of Charles from his regiment; but, no &s;ooner did this generous youth make his appearance, or, more &s;trictly &s;peaking, no &s;ooner was his mother dead, than he left to his &s;i&s;ter's dute|ous care a &s;um, for which he drew on the agent of his regiment, &s;ufficient to every purpo&s;e. Yet the &s;upply of hone&s;t Denni&s;on had its u&s;e; for as that of Charles did not arrive until after the decea&s;e of his mother, the fir&s;t fund was appropriated to the afore|&s;aid purpo&s;es, and the &s;econd Caroline helo in re&s;erve, intending to return it to her bro|ther, knowing the &s;canty profits of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and how often he had forced upon her mother and her&s;elf tho&s;e accommoda|tions which ought to have been furni&s;hed from the coffers of Sir Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the depo&s;its from her own little trea&s;ury, we are to reckon all her new guineas, half-guineas, pocket-pieces, and, indeed, every thing that had but the a&s;pect of currency, except a &s;ilver penny, which was the fir&s;t keep-&s;ake of Henry Fitzorton,
<PB N="295" REF="303">given in the flowery days of their mutual childhood.</P>
<P>Mean time, it would be a flagrant viola|tion of what was due to Denni&s;on, not to &s;ay that he carefully put his young lady's depo&s;it in his &s;trong box, &s;acred and apart, and &s;uper&s;cribed, "The&s;e, placed here for &s;afety, belong to Mi&s;s Stuart, with &s;undry other articles mentioned in my la&s;t will and te&s;ta|ment, a copy whereof is within."</P>
<P>Previous to adju&s;ting this little conven|tion, due prai&s;e was be&s;towed on the conduct of lady Stuart's &s;ervants, in preparing them|&s;elves for the funeral. And this their be|haviour was the more laudable, ina&s;much as it was voluntary and di&s;intere&s;ted; for al|though Caroline had, in obedience to her mother's injunctions, an intention to pre&s;ent &s;ome little memorial to them all, tho&s;e afflicting events in which we have &s;een her involved, had hitherto prevented the di&s;tribu|tion of any &s;uch memorial, except to Den|ni&s;on. Uncon&s;cious, therefore, that Caroline had any thing in re&s;erve for them, they had, out of the love and good will for their lady,
<PB N="294" REF="304">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="295" REF="305">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="296" REF="306">at their own expence, put them&s;elves into habiliments &s;uitable to the &s;olemnity, and would probably have thought an injunction to &s;tay at home on the night their late beloved mi&s;tre&s;s was to be buried, the only &s;evere duty they ever performed in her &s;ervice. Caroline, therefore, had &s;carcely given them permi&s;&s;ion to follow their inclinations than they thronged about the coffin, as it was bringing down &s;tairs, with a jealou&s;y of gra|titude, as if each envied the other a &s;hare of the melancholy burthen, accompanied by &s;uch lamentations as attend only virtue to the tomb.</P>
<P>They were met at the outward porch of the abbey, by the venerable Monk, with &s;ix a&s;&s;i&s;tants of his order, whom he had con|vened, bearing the holy crucifix and the lighted torches; and on their receiving the corp&s;e, they began to chaunt their &s;olemn anthems.</P>
<P>The abbey clock &s;truck eleven as they entered the wood, through which the pro|ce&s;&s;ion moved to the chapel, and from thence, after tho&s;e ceremonies which the
<PB N="297" REF="307">Roman church has ordained, was conveyed to the vault; upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of which, Caroline, who had &s;u&s;tained her&s;elf hither|to with a mournful fortitude, that &s;erved as an example to the re&s;t, &s;hrunk back and exclaimed, "O God, &s;upport me!" Though &s;he had taken a religious care to re|&s;erve a &s;pace for her own remains, &s;he could not behold the place where &s;he was to take leave of tho&s;e of her mother, and at the &s;ame time &s;ee her&s;elf &s;urrounded by the moulder|ing ruins of her ance&s;tors, and more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who had been the originals of the miniatures which were her mother's death|bed legacy&mdash;all this &s;he could not behold without a &s;en&s;e of angui&s;h not to be con|trolled; and that of the worthy Denni&s;on was &s;carcely le&s;s. Upon the coffin being com|mitted to the place where it was de&s;tined to repo&s;e, it was with difficulty the dome&s;tics could bear the &s;ight. The venerable Arthur was him&s;elf deeply affected; for though he had the firmne&s;s of a man, and the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive virtues of a chri&s;tian, his affections were warm, and his feelings tender. Caroline
<PB N="298" REF="308">approached the body as if to bid it a final farewell. The good man conducted her to the foot of the coffin, at which &s;he kneeled, and the wailings of the attendants, at this aweful moment, re&s;ounded through the vault.</P>
<P>Henry had been traver&s;ing that part of the wood which led to the chapel, &s;ome hours before the proce&s;&s;ion began. He joined it &s;oon after it had pa&s;&s;ed the abbey gate; but was &s;o &s;hrouded by the night, the undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing gleam of the tapers, and &s;till more by the ab&s;orbing grief which fixed every eye and every heart to its object, as to pa&s;s in the train un&s;een. He was unwilling to ob|trude him&s;elf upon his beloved Caroline, in this &s;olemn moment of her duty and affliction: a &s;entiment which probably would have led him to pay &s;ilent re&s;pect to the living and to the dead, without di&s;covering him&s;elf, had not events determined it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Unable to &s;upport the la&s;t look, and the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the vault, Caroline was attempting to ri&s;e when &s;he &s;unk upon her mother's coffin, over which &s;he threw her
<PB N="299" REF="309">arms in that &s;ort of dumb de&s;pair, which could be relieved only by a temporary de|privation of every &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;ight like this was in&s;upportable to Henry, who, running to the object of his &s;oul, exclaimed, "O Caroline! if Charles be dear, be comforted!"&mdash;"Charles!" cried Caroline faintly; "and has his grief and duty brought him to this &s;ad &s;pot? Alas, my brother!"&mdash;Here, without lifting up her eyes, &s;he cla&s;ped her arm around his neck, and weptaloud.&mdash;"No," rejoined Henry, "not Charles, but his friend, his repre&s;entative, appointed by him&s;elf; of this, if you are not appri&s;ed, the occa&s;ion &s;urely ju&s;tifies the tre&s;pa&s;s, and will urge you to forgive it."&mdash; "Forgive it," an&s;wered Caroline, withdraw|ing her&s;elf from his embrace, yet ca&s;ting on him a look of penetrating tenderne&s;s,&mdash;"Are <HI>you</HI> my brother's repre&s;entative? O! where|fore am I deprived the power of offering the pure incen&s;e of my heart for &s;uch di&s;inter|e&s;ted&mdash;this generous!"&mdash;She could not connect the&s;e unfini&s;hed &s;entences, and at
<PB N="300" REF="310">the end of the la&s;t, &s;he dropped, rather than reclined, on Henry's &s;houlder.</P>
<P>The widower, we will not call him mourn|er, willing to avoid the odium of tho&s;e reports which he fore&s;aw would go forth again&s;t him, and dreading to be left at the abbey in no better company than his own reflec|tions,&mdash;now when he thought the ceremony was nearly over, entered the vault with all tho&s;e mockeries of woe which he &s;o well knew how to a&s;&s;ume, when it &s;erved his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the&s;e counterfeit griefs were changed to the mo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled paroxy&s;ms of rage, the moment he beheld Caroline Stuart &s;up ported by Henry Fitzorton; and without reflecting on time, place or circum&s;tance, and before his con&s;titutional fear had checked his con&s;titutional impetuo&s;ity, he a&s;&s;everated, in a voice that might affright the echoes of the vault, "perdition on you both! again! and in &s;ight of your mother's very grave! And thou, infamous accomplice," added he, turning to Arthur, "to permit &s;uch things!
<PB N="301" REF="311">at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on! But it belongs to your trade."&mdash;Arthur, though the gentle&s;t of hu|man beings, brooked not the &s;malle&s;t irreve|rence either again&s;t his character or office;&mdash; "In performing the commi&s;&s;ion of my im|mortal God," &s;aid he, "I am not to be interrupted by mortal man!"</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid Henry, delivering the &s;inking Caroline to her father, "I am here, you are to be informed, as the &s;ub&s;titute of your &s;on, and at his &s;trong injunction: why this &s;acred duty was to be performed by proxy you be&s;t can tell."&mdash;"I know not of it," &s;aid Caro|line, recovering; but Sir Gui&s;e, with un|manly violence, thru&s;t her from him, and &s;he would have fallen again, had not Arthur &s;prung to receive her, exclaiming, "I, ma|dam, will be your protector, in a place and in a cau&s;e like this, again&s;t a thou&s;and cruel fathers!&mdash;Sacrilegious! bring not your de|&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ions into the tombs of your family! let tho&s;e at lea&s;t be privileged. You know not how &s;oon you may be num|bered with their cold inhabitants; and your
<PB N="302" REF="312">unprepared &s;oul &s;ummoned to an&s;wer for the outrage here committed."</P>
<P>Hearing this, the a&s;&s;embly, and more e&s;pecially his own dome&s;tics, began to be tumultuous. The words "unnatural father! vile hu&s;band! and tyrant ma&s;ter!" were heard from one to the other, till it &s;pread beyond the vault, even to the chapel, which was now filled with the multitude. The prie&s;ts and the people, who had attended the funeral, ru&s;hed in di&s;order out of the ceme|tery. The indignation became general, and every one &s;eeming glad of an opportunity to expre&s;s their &s;en&s;e of the unhallowed violence which Sir Gui&s;e had perpetrated, and their dete&s;tation of his character, gave a loo&s;e to their &s;en&s;ations in a way that would pro|bably have put an end to the iniquities of the object of their fury, had not Caroline implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Denni&s;on, Henry, and Arthur, to &s;ave her father; and, almo&s;t at the hazard of their own lives, they con|ducted him home amid&s;t the groans and hi&s;&s;es of the populace.</P>

<P>CAROLINE, meanwhile, was le&s;t by Henry and father Arthur in the charge of two &s;ervants, with directions to lead her to the chaple-hou&s;e; but no per&s;ua&s;ions nor any con&s;iderations of her&s;elf, could prevent her from following her father, who&s;e life &s;he thought in danger. The re&s;t of the &s;ervants were a&s;&s;i&s;ting to lead her to the abbey, and &s;uch of the populace as her pitiable &s;ituation had attracted round her, took her in their arms, and, placing her in a chair which they brought from the chapel-hou&s;e, they carried her in triumph upon their &s;houlders, huzzaing and calling down ble&s;&s;ings upon her at every &s;tep.&mdash;In this condition &s;he was met by fa|ther Arthur and Henry; commanding the &s;till clamorous people to keep &s;ilence, to venerate the dead, and &s;o far re&s;pect the living, as not to commit farther violence. Henry reinforced the&s;e arguments with all his eloquence, and declared, he would de|fend the father of Caroline Stuart, on &s;uch
<PB N="304" REF="314">an occa&s;ion, with the la&s;t drop of his blood. "Is he &s;afe?" exclaimed Caroline. Being &s;atisfied on which head, &s;he &s;o movingly a&s;&s;i&s;ted Henry and Arthur by a &s;peech which might almo&s;t have touched Sir Gui&s;e him&s;elf, that the multitude, after crying out, as with one voice, "Long live mi&s;s Caroline!&mdash; ble&s;&s;ed be mi&s;s Caroline!"&mdash;quietly and re|&s;pectfully departing to their habitations.</P>
<P>At the abbey gate, Henry, al&s;o, took his leave, for which he was repaid by a look from Caroline that almo&s;t atoned for the lo&s;s of her &s;ociety. He took father Arthur a&s;ide to reque&s;t that modern patriarch would remain at the abbey until the break of day, le&s;t any fre&s;h tumult &s;hould happen, which his authority might quell; ob&s;erving, that there were particular rea&s;ons why he him&s;elf could not tarry; adding at the &s;ame time, that he would one day probably be made acquainted with them. Po&s;&s;ibly Arthur had been &s;truck with &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions, that had dropped from Caroline in the fore|going &s;cene, but he had not an atom of impertinent curio&s;ity in his di&s;po&s;ition;&mdash;
<PB N="305" REF="315">as he, therefore, bade him farewell, he a&s;|&s;ured him if he thought it too early in the morning to repair to the ca&s;tle, and would accept of a Franci&s;can's coar&s;e and humble, but clean, and whole&s;ome bed, the chapel|hou&s;e was at his devotion: "And this, &s;ir," &s;aid he, pre&s;enting him with a &s;mall key, "will open a clo&s;et that holds a cordial worth being taken off in a bumper, even to the health of the good young lady who&s;e cau&s;e you have &s;o nobly defended."</P>
<P>To the abhorrent poi&s;on brooding in the mind of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, were now added his di&s;graces at the chapel-hou&s;e. He collected the &s;cattered points of his growing antipa|thies, and the focus pre&s;ented to him Henry, Arthur, and Caroline in a con&s;piracy.&mdash;The country was up in arms again&s;t him&mdash;the multitude had made him their mark.&mdash;Exe|crations had been poured in torrents in the middle of the night&mdash;and that, the night of the funeral of his wife, whom his tyranny, they &s;aid, had brought to an untimely end&mdash; nay, there were not wanting &s;ome who be|lieved, or feigned to believe, that &s;he had
<PB N="306" REF="316">been privately murdered; &s;ome that he was him&s;elf the murderer; while others, very gravely a&s;&s;erted that the barbarous mon&s;ter had made her lay violent hands on her&s;elf, and that Caroline was about to follow her example, but was found ju&s;t in time to be &s;aved by her brother and Henry Fitzorton. There are always tho&s;e who exceed the truth, or dimini&s;h it, on the oppo&s;ite principles of candour and malevolence. The co-opera|tions of the&s;e reports, in their natural pro|gre&s;s from bad to wor&s;e, all tended to feed in his brea&s;t that &s;erpent which brooded there as in its congenial ne&s;t, waiting, like its wilely progenitor, a &s;ecure opportunity to eject its gathered poi&s;ons upon the innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting.</P>
<P>But however &s;ingular it may appear to &s;uch of our readers as are unpracti&s;ed in a knowledge of tho&s;e frauds of life, which teach men of the world to di&s;&s;emble their hate; others, who are more deeply read in the hi&s;tory of human nature, will find, alas! nothing very extraordinary, when they are told that Sir Gui&s;e Stuart concealed his aims
<PB N="307" REF="317">and purpo&s;es with a circum&s;pection propor|tioned to the increa&s;e of the dete&s;tation from whence they &s;prung; and when &s;uch dete&s;|tation was at its height, &s;o that even <HI>his</HI> bo&s;om, fitted as it was for the nouri&s;hment of evil pa&s;&s;ions, could hold no more, the rude and &s;udden &s;torms, which &s;hook his frame on former occa&s;ions, were all hu&s;hed; his turbulent nature &s;eemed to repo&s;e as in a dead calm, over the face of which was fre|quently &s;een a &s;mile, as if the tempe&s;tuous part of his di&s;po&s;ition had &s;pent its force, and nothing remained but the &s;pirit of peace. This wonderful revolution took place on the morning of his being hooted from the chapel to the abbey. From that epoch, we are to date the la&s;t po&s;&s;ible exce&s;s of his inveteracy to the whole hou&s;e of Fitzorton, and to the whole of his own family, except Charles, for whom he &s;till felt, at it were again&s;t his will, an unaccountable predilection.</P>
<P>Henry, on the other hand, had made &s;ome di&s;coveries at the funeral &s;cene, melancholy as it was, which returned upon his mind the beams of hope. He &s;aw he was &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="308" REF="318">of Caroline's love, and that her conceal|ment of that love did not proceed from her own caprice, or from any di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him, but from her father, who, he concluded, had impo&s;ed on her a cruel obedience. This di&s;covery, endeared the daughter in the degree that it rendered the parent odicus. Yet his anger abated whenever he reflected that its object was the father of his deare&s;t friend, and of his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s: and the parting look which Caroline be&s;towed, although it gleamed on him&mdash;only from the light of funeral tapers, afforded him a ray far more chearing than had the noon-tide &s;un, when he trod that very path, on the day that Caroline di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The turret clock &s;truck three in the morning, as Henry arrived at the ca&s;tle, where he had the misfortune to hear that Olivia was much wor&s;e than when he le&s;t home. It &s;eems that the di&s;order which had prevailed at the funeral, had communicated part of its confu&s;ion to the ca&s;tle, from
<PB N="309" REF="319">whence two of the &s;ervants ran to &s;ee the ceremony. The name of one of the&s;e was George Trewe, commonly called, by way of characteri&s;ing his worth, True George, who went out of pure good will to his young ma&s;ter; the other &s;ervant, out of curio&s;ity, having never &s;een the catholick ceremonies of burial. The &s;ervices of this youth had been divided between John and Henry: for &s;ome time pa&s;t he had wholly attached him&s;elf to the latter, and had been on all occa&s;ions the &s;hadow of his ma&s;ter; though in his nightly expeditions, le&s;s &s;een than that &s;hadow. Whenever he feared that his attending would not be acceptable, or that they would appear obtru&s;ive, impertinent, or unnece&s;&s;ary, he was, from motives yet undivulged, &s;till his invi&s;ible a&s;&s;ociate; and when his pre&s;ence might be u&s;eful, he would appear in the twinkling of an eye, and impute &s;uch ap|pearance to accident. Thus, George was among the mo&s;t active in hooting Sir Gui&s;e, while Henry &s;eemed to declare again&s;t him; and the mo&s;t vigorous in his defence the moment he heard his ma&s;ter a&s;&s;ert, that he
<PB N="310" REF="320">would protect the father of Caroline, even with his blood. George too, was the centre pillar of &s;upport to Caroline, when &s;he was carried in the chair, which he fixed upon his head, while the re&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted only with their hands and &s;houlders; and thus was George hid from his ma&s;ter; while he rendered him the mo&s;t welcome &s;ervice in the world. George al&s;o it was, who, after the affray, made &s;ome &s;hort cuts through the wood at full &s;peed, that he might reach home before his ma&s;ter, and have, what the poor fellow u&s;ed to call the "little comforts" prepared; more particularly &s;ince. Henry was be|come, as George aptly enough called him, "a night walker;" in which character, though George always took care to keep aloof, he was, when it was either bitter weather, or he &s;u&s;pected any danger, his ma&s;ter's invi&s;ible companion; but &s;imply to do him &s;ervice, and to take care of him without the lea&s;t de&s;ire to entrap his &s;ecrets. Thus was the hone&s;t adherent, privy to Henry's mo&s;t retired &s;oliloquies; and he it was, who placed in the fore&s;t, which Henry
<PB N="311" REF="321">&s;o frequently haunted, tho&s;e accommoda|tions, which the heated brain of his ma&s;ter &s;ometimes attributed to magic: and well he might! for &s;ometimes a peach would ripen upon a barren thorn, a pine-ap|ple enrich a bramble, and bunches of the grape be twi&s;ted with the May-bu&s;h. Hence al&s;o, George was as well acquainted with his ma&s;ter's pa&s;&s;ion as he was him&s;elf, and from ju&s;t as unque&s;tionable an authority,&mdash;namely, from his ma&s;ter's confe&s;&s;ions, uttered by his own lips; from all which the poor fellow had drawn an inference, which led him one dark night to kneel down in a wood, they were then haunting, even on the wet ground,&mdash;being at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from his ma&s;ter,&mdash;and &s;wore, "he would he might be d****d if ever he left him alone again, if he could help it, after eight o'clock."</P>
<P>The other &s;ervant, however, had been before-hand with George, having retreated from the chapel as &s;oon as the mob began to be riotous: for though this man had much curio&s;ity he had little enterpri&s;e, and, on
<PB N="312" REF="322">the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of danger, alway; took the wor&s;t that could happen for granted, anticipating murder before a blow was &s;truck. Upon this &s;y&s;tem, therefore, concluding that when the rabble began to hu&s;tle the baronet, there would be much havoc, he made the be&s;t of his way home, and told Olivia and John, whom he fir&s;t encountered, not only what he &s;aw, but what he did not &s;ee, and what in fact did not happen, except in the wild regions of his own terrified fancy. He related, with &s;uitable marks of con&s;ternation, "as how the daughter &s;ell into fits upon her mother's grave, and how his young ma&s;ter picked her up, and with the help of the papi&s;h par&s;on,"&mdash;as he called father Arthur&mdash; "had almo&s;t brought her to her&s;elf, when her father coming in, and &s;eeing her held up by Mr. Henry, doubled both his fi&s;ts and knocked her down again, for letting one of the ca&s;tle family touch the hem of her garment; and as how then the <HI>papi&s;ht</HI> gave a knock to Sir Gui&s;e, who returned it on Mr. Henry; whereupon the whole place was in an uproar; tumbling over the coffins, and
<PB N="313" REF="323">getting out of the chapel as well as they could; and how, when they got into the chapel-yard they were met by all the coun|try with &s;ticks and &s;taves, trying to part Sir Gui&s;e and Mr. Henry, who fought like two lions; and as how, after this, many cried out murder; upon which," continued the fellow, "I ran home to get &s;ome more hands to help my ma&s;ter, who &s;eeing the grudge Sir Gui&s;e bears him, may, perhaps, be dead by this time."</P>
<P>True George no &s;ooner heard this, than he execrated his fellow-&s;ervant both for his babbling and cowardice; and upon being further informed that Olivia had been car|ried to her chamber in <HI>hy&s;tericals,</HI> as the fellow called them;&mdash; "I'll tell you what," &s;aid George, "that being the ca&s;e, if you &s;tay until my young ma&s;ter, who is &s;afe, God ble&s;s him, comes in, and he is ju&s;t behind; it will be wor&s;e for you, that's all: I &s;hould not wonder if he was to murder you on the &s;pot; and if it was not for the law I would do it my&s;elf!"&mdash;As he pro|nounced
<PB N="314" REF="324">the&s;e words a rap was given at the door, when the affrighted author of all this mi&s;chief, already half-killed with George's menace, di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Upon the entrance, however, of Henry, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to be apprized of what had happened, and accordingly George was beginning to recapitulate, when John Fitzorton came down, and, &s;uperior to en|quiry, in&s;i&s;ted that nothing ought to &s;atisfy Olivia of his having e&s;caped with life, but his going up &s;tairs that in&s;tant to convince her of it in per&s;on. This he accordingly did, but had &s;ome difficulty in per&s;uading her he was not hurt; he a&s;&s;ured her that the fellow, in his fears, had overcharged the facts, which were no more than that mi&s;s Stuart, overborne by her di&s;tre&s;s, was &s;up|ported, mutually, between him&s;elf and father Arthur; that Sir Gui&s;e Stuart having exa&s;|perated the rabble, it was partly to prevent wor&s;e con&s;equences that he had remained as his ab&s;ent friend's repre&s;entative. This was nothing but the truth, though it was by no means the whole truth, and, perhaps, Henry
<PB N="315" REF="325">fine&s;&s;ed a little more than u&s;ual on the occa|&s;ion; like modern politicians, he &s;unk all &s;uch articles as would have made again&s;t his cau&s;e, and pre&s;erved &s;uch only as &s;et off what he really did unfold, to the be&s;t advan|tage: a &s;aving kind of knowledge, well known to generals and &s;tate&s;men, and by them practi&s;ed in their official recitals of more bloody affrays than that which hap|pened at the funeral of lady Stuart.</P>
<P>Now if &s;uch &s;uffrages cannot ju&s;tify Henry's adoption of this military and mini&s;|terial manceuvering, we mu&s;t give him up to the reader's cen&s;ure. Our hi&s;tory records the actions of men, and not of angels, and it is our province to de&s;cribe human nature &s;uch as it is, rather than &s;uch as it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>Henry's account was, however, the be&s;t that he could have cho&s;en to an&s;wer his pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e, and, perhaps, much better than he intended, for his principal de&s;ire obvi|ou&s;ly was, to &s;ilence the alarms of Olivia: and, indeed, his &s;taterments had not only effected this, but al&s;o &s;atisfied the re&s;t of the
<PB N="316" REF="326">family. John, in his deci&s;ive way, pro|nounced it proper to defend even an infamous individual again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ions of many, though he owned it would have been for the good of &s;ociety had they devoured him.&mdash; "Yes," &s;aid Olivia, "and how much more generous is the conduct of your brother, when you con&s;ider who that individual is&mdash; an hated enemy."&mdash;" It is all very fine and heroic," &s;aid Olivia's father;&mdash;" but, in the mean time, the&s;e great exploits of one &s;ort or another happen &s;o often, that our young hero generally contrives to di&s;turb us once or twice a week in the middle of the night; and after he has kept us from our beds, and frightened us out of our wits, the bu&s;ine&s;s fini&s;hes with a hi&s;tory, in which the &s;aid hero has acted &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part, that the more he terrifies us, the more we find we ought to return him our thanks. I wi&s;h," added the old gentleman, "we could con|fine him to one great action a month, or that, at lea&s;t, he would take day-light for his magnanimous exploits, as the&s;e nocturnal marches and counter-marches by no means
<PB N="317" REF="327">&s;uit either with my age or my Olivia's youth; to prevent any new adventure befalling our amiable Quixote, let us to bed."</P>
<P>The propo&s;al was univer&s;ally agreed to.&mdash; "George," &s;aid Henry, as he was undre&s;&s;|ing, "I find that bungling blockhead has made a pretty piece of work about nothing; but as no harm has ari&s;en from it, and as the poor devil hardly knew what he &s;aid, I think we may as well let him live this time: yet it was a tremendous &s;cene; you are a &s;pirited fellow, and had <HI>you</HI> been pre&s;ent, I do not know what would have been the con&s;e|quence."</P>
<P>"Me, your honour!" &s;aid George, not to be thrown from his guard, having more than once &s;uffered thereby, "what &s;hould I do there, unle&s;s your honour was in danger, and my poor &s;ervices could do any thing for you? but as to my fellow-&s;ervant, &s;ince 'tis your honour's plea&s;ure, I'll not be hanged for him yet, which I certainly &s;hall be one day or another; for to tell your honour the truth, I do not think it right to let a fellow's
<PB N="318" REF="328">head remain upon his &s;houlders any longer than he can keep the tongue in it from bladding:&mdash;if a fellow can't keep a &s;ecret, why there's an end of a fellow&mdash;there's an end of him, your honour." Henry &s;miled, and de&s;ired True George to betake him&s;elf to re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>WE fear there will appear to the reader, as there did to True George, who was no le&s;s in the &s;ecret, that the&s;e &s;allies of Henry were incon&s;i&s;tent with the character which he had before &s;upported; for though nothing could be more amiable than his de|portment at the funeral, and at the affray, his forgetfulne&s;s of what had pa&s;&s;ed at home, and his &s;udden oblivion of what he had &s;een, nay had made, Olivia &s;uffer, cannot, perhaps, be readily excu&s;ed. If the reader, however, recurs to the di&s;covery he pre&s;umed he had made of Caroline's unaltered love, tho&s;e who happen to be of the &s;ame &s;anguine di&s;po&s;i|tion, or who, being thoroughly in love, may have experienced &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations, will find nothing unnatural in this part of his conduct; in truth, a kind look, a &s;oft &s;igh, an affec|tionate word, when that affection was before doubtful, will put all the pride of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, and, it is to be feared, every con&s;ideration that does not connect with
<PB N="320" REF="330">that look, &s;igh, or word, to flight; and al|though upon a full &s;urvey of the matter, not one of the numberle&s;s impediments that &s;tood between Henry and Caroline were removed by the di&s;covery which he had made, yet, it animated his &s;pirits, and cha&s;ed from his heart every image of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Olivia &s;oon recovered from her indi&s;po|&s;ition; the more &s;he &s;aw of her beloved Henry, the greater was her tenderne&s;s. "There are points in his di&s;po&s;ition," &s;he would &s;ay, "which appear to make him &s;ometimes prefer &s;olitude even to my &s;ociety; and with the&s;e, I am apt to quarrel, but this is &s;elfi&s;h. To that &s;olitude I owe the effu|&s;ions of his charming genius. He engages in &s;cenes which make me tremble for his &s;afety, it is true, but that proceeds from the weak|ne&s;s of my fears, or the &s;trength of my affec|tion; on his return to me, I always find him good, affectionate, and kind; and have rea|&s;on to congratulate my&s;elf. Even the ab&s;ence which I &s;o often mourn, produces from his bounteous heart &s;ome relief to the unfor|tunate, or a more perfect joy to the happy.
<PB N="321" REF="331">It is, indeed, hard to &s;ay whether the mirth or melancholy of my deare&s;t Henry is 02 mo&s;t &s;educing; or which ought mo&s;t to endear him to me. He never finds his na|ture yielding to the felicities of the fir&s;t, that he does not ha&s;ten to &s;hare it with tho&s;e who are dear to him; but when, perceiving his mind under the involuntary dominion of the pen&s;ive part of his nature, &s;olitude is &s;weet to him, not only becau&s;e he is too generous to ca&s;t a gloom over the happine&s;s of his friends, but, perhaps, becau&s;e pen&s;ivene&s;s, and the &s;eque&s;tration it u&s;ually &s;eeks, is a &s;ource of his happine&s;s. It is true, there are times when the melancholy power comes upon him, even in our &s;ociety; the &s;ight of &s;orrow, a tear, a &s;igh, a thought that but leads to &s;adne&s;s will &s;trike the nerve to which his affections tremble.&mdash;But ought this to be brought again&s;t him, when I have &s;een him ru&s;h from the &s;ociety mo&s;t precious to him,&mdash;from friends, brothers, parents, and his Olivia,&mdash;le&s;t he &s;hould communicate &s;adne&s;s?"</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="332">With &s;uch arguments would &s;he &s;oothe her &s;pirits, and account for the wanderings of Henry. It was after a &s;oliloquy of this kind, when &s;he had, in like manner, &s;ettled the mo&s;t irreconcileable parts of his beha|viour to his credit, and her content,&mdash; what cannot the tender love of woman effect!&mdash;that he entered the room where &s;he had been rea&s;oning. It was the morning after the&s;e nocturnal di&s;turbances, and when his vivacity had been called forth by the lucky con&s;truction which had been given to the late events, that he joined Olivia, with whom imagination had been playing as many vagaries, and, in this mutual delu&s;ion, they deceived each other without de&s;igning, or, it is probable, being con&s;cious of it; for every word they &s;aid, was at fir&s;t, the mere effect of good &s;pirits on both &s;ides, created by what to them appeared good pro&s;pects; though they were never farther than at this moment from looking on the &s;ame objects, in the &s;ame point of view.</P>
<P>"I have been chiding my&s;elf, Henry," &s;aid Olivia.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="333">"Then you have been very wicked," he an&s;wered; "for therein you accu&s;ed the innocent; but, as I believe, it is your fir&s;t fault, I think I mu&s;t intercede with my good friend, father Arthur, to give you ab&s;olution."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t fault! by no means!" replied Olivia; "I have done it a thou&s;and times; but, if it be a &s;in, you are generally the cau&s;e of it, and ought, of cour&s;e, to &s;hare the puni&s;hment; and yet, methinks, could it be proved that you partook the guilt, I would exempt you from the penalty, and &s;uffer for us both."</P>
<P>"That would not be fair," &s;aid Henry; "but how have I been the cau&s;e, pray?"</P>
<P>"Why you are too good, and I am always finding fault with you for it," replied &s;he.</P>
<P>"I rather think the faults are mine, the goodne&s;s yours," cried Henry. "Indeed, I think you &s;o good, that I have feared, until very lately, there could not be found a mortal man who truly de&s;erved you; and yet, I am almo&s;t bold enough to &s;ay,
<PB N="324" REF="334">&s;uch a man, I think, I have found too, aye, and you know him."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure I do," &s;ays &s;he, &s;miling. "O, that a woman could be found worthy of Henry Fitzorton!" exclaimed Olivia.</P>
<P>"And yet there is," interrupted Henry, with ardour, "&s;uch a woman to be found worthy of a man, were he ten thou&s;and times&mdash;were he as much my &s;uperior in every thing&mdash;as &s;he is her&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Then it is impo&s;&s;ible," an&s;wered Oli|via, colouring highly, "that I &s;hould have the &s;malle&s;t acquaintance with this paragon."</P>
<P>"And yet&mdash;and yet, &s;he is not in any one grace or virtue &s;uperior to Olivia; but for the man who can merit an alliance with this all-accompli&s;hed! I verily believe, after all, he is yet to be born."</P>
<P>"Poh, you are in love with her, and are be&s;ides a poet, you know," an&s;wered Olivia, blu&s;hing a deeper carnation; "for my part, I really think there are fifty men de&s;erve a much better woman than Olivia."</P>
<P>"And yet there is but one man in the
<PB N="325" REF="335">creation I would give my con&s;ent &s;he &s;hould marry," returned Henry.</P>
<P>"Would to heaven!" &s;aid Olivia, "that your choice may make you as happy as it will your Olivia."</P>
<P>Here the very names of Caroline and Charles, and all the hi&s;tory thereunto be|longing, were hovering on the edge of Henry's lips, when Olivia &s;ent them back again to the rece&s;&s;es of his bo&s;om, by an|&s;wering with an ardour, that matched his own, giving her hand at the &s;ame time;&mdash; "Ah, you know that it is &s;o&mdash;you know, that poor and humble as are my preten&s;ions, inferior in all things, but in affection, to that one being you allude to, I have long been, and &s;hall be for ever, devoted to him! The terrors that invade me, when I behold a gloom upon his brow, a tear upon his cheek, or hear a &s;igh bur&s;t from his bo&s;om, and all the griefs I experience in his ab&s;ence, ari&s;e only from the certainty, that were I more near to him in the virtues which fir&s;t made me love him, all would be well. I tell my heart, he then could not look &s;ad, or
<PB N="326" REF="336">&s;igh or weep, becau&s;e my power over him would be no le&s;s than his over Olivia, who&s;e wor&s;t evils flee at his bidding, and vani&s;h even at his &s;ight: ina&s;much, that as his ab&s;ence is her &s;ickne&s;s, &s;o is his pre&s;ence her recovery. Yes, Henry! tho&s;e perfections in me would render you as happy in the company of Olivia, as &s;he ever is in yours: and it is this inequality on my part, that is the &s;ource of tho&s;e reproaches, with which I load my&s;elf, until, in my anger, I utter a prayer that you were le&s;s amiable, or I more worthy."</P>
<P>Olivia poured forth the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions of her heart,&mdash;confe&s;&s;ions which &s;eemed to be called for,&mdash;into the bo&s;om of a youth with whom, one eventful year excepted, &s;he had been bred, educated, and taught by duty and in|clination, judgment and pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;by all &s;he loved, and all &s;he honoured, to appreciate;&mdash; and of who&s;e love &s;he never for a moment doubted, though the reader is aware, he never once mentioned that word to her. She delivered her&s;elf with a rapidity and unre|&s;erved fervour, accompanied by endearments,
<PB N="327" REF="337">at once &s;o delicate and kind, which their long intimacy, and the &s;uppo&s;ed near ap|proach of that day which was to unite them in the holie&s;t of all human ties, &s;trictly war|ranted, that Henry mu&s;t have had a very different heart from that he carried in his bo&s;om, if he had not been &s;omewhat more than pa&s;&s;ive to &s;o much innocence, beauty, and tenderne&s;s, cheri&s;hing a &s;weet delu&s;ion, upon which depended the hope not only of <HI>her</HI> happine&s;s, but that of the authors of both their beings, and, indeed, every indi|vidual of both their families.</P>
<P>"Sweet Olivia!" exclaimed he, gazing earne&s;tly upon her, "I do not de&s;erve this,&mdash; and yet from my inmo&s;t &s;oul I wi&s;h&mdash;"</P>
<P>He continued his gaze, and while he was &s;o doing, &s;oftly approaching her, a tear dropped on her lovely face, which &s;he no &s;ooner felt, than lifting her eyes towards him, as if to read the hi&s;tory of his countenance, &s;he &s;aid, in accents no words can paint,&mdash; "There are tears to relieve, and expre&s;s an heart overburthened with its joy, are there not, my Henry? I hope the&s;e are &s;uch: I do
<PB N="328" REF="338">not weep my&s;elf; yet when I been &s;o happy!"</P>
<P>"Long be you &s;o," replied Henry; "and, Oh! that it was decreed as long for me to make you &s;o!"</P>
<P>"We are very young," an&s;wered Olivia, with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;implicity, "and may reckon upon many many years like this ble&s;t moment! I am &s;ure you will never be le&s;s beloved!"</P>
<P>Henry was labouring to &s;mother a heart|&s;ick &s;igh; he gently ki&s;&s;ed off the tears he had let fall on her cheek, when both their fathers came in and &s;urpri&s;ed them: "Proofs ro&s;e on proofs, and &s;till the la&s;t &s;eemed &s;tronge&s;t!"</P>

<P>THOSE of our readers who are parents, and have their darling children circum|&s;tanced like the&s;e, or at lea&s;t as the&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to be, can decide on the emotions that now took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e vene|rable men. How unlike to what Sir Gui&s;e experienced when he di&s;covered Henry and Caroline in nearly a &s;imilar &s;ituation!</P>
<P>Through a gla&s;s door, &s;haded only by a curtain of &s;light &s;ilk that was ea&s;ily drawn a&s;ide, the happy parents had &s;tood &s;ome moments delighting them&s;elves with the view, and on their entrance could only &s;ay, "Deare&s;t, deare&s;t children, we have been concerting mea&s;ures for the happine&s;s of Henry and Olivia!" and they both wept.</P>
<P>Lady Fitzorton entered, and was made happy by the relation of what had &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly affected the re&s;t of the party.</P>
<P>In the mean time, John Fitzorton, leaving the company who had walked into the gar|den, betook him&s;elf to his chamber, his
<PB N="330" REF="340">u&s;ual &s;anctuary under any &s;udden pre&s;&s;ure of thought, or of emotion: but he &s;oon rallied, and rejoined his friends, then catching Henry's arm he &s;aid, as he turned with him into a private path, "You have often hinted, your friend Charles regretted that his mili|tary &s;tation was inconvenient to him. It mu&s;t be more &s;o &s;ince the death of his mother; as his &s;i&s;ter is now wholly in the power of her execrable father. I have thought about this, and had it often in recollection &s;ince my return from the cam|paign, to refer my&s;elf to you for tho&s;e particulars which your intimacy with the family might have afforded."&mdash;Henry trem|bled &mdash;"But you have of late been &s;o &s;hut up within your&s;elf, that I have not had an opportunity to mention either that, or &s;ome intelligence out of the family re&s;pecting your&s;elf."&mdash;Henry's agitation increa&s;ed.&mdash; "I under&s;tand," continued John, "that intere&s;t is &s;till paying for the money which Charles borrowed of an u&s;urer to purcha&s;e his lieutenancy."</P>
<P>Henry was in the &s;tate of him who is
<PB N="331" REF="341">told of his reprieve with the halter about his neck. "Suppo&s;e," re&s;umed John, "your friend were to di&s;po&s;e of that com|mi&s;&s;ion, and apply the profits of it in di&s;charge of that loan, and then come into our regiment, where, by the lo&s;s of a brave youth who fell fighting by my &s;ide, I can introduce him without co&s;t."</P>
<P>The generous reader mu&s;t him&s;elf &s;upply the &s;en&s;ations of Henry on this propo&s;al.</P>
<P>"But," ob&s;erved John, "though there are no impediments in the way of the gift it&s;elf, there are &s;ome in that of giving. The recent meeting I have had with his &s;coundrel father makes it impo&s;&s;ible for me to be &s;een in tran&s;action of this nature. It would appear like parading a &s;ervice which I knew the brave youth would not receive. What I would not accept I will not offer. But you are the friend of his heart. He cannot, or ought not, to have any he&s;ita|tion with you; for if there be yet any of this &s;ort of <HI>&s;entimentizing</HI> between you, both are yet to learn the truth of a
<PB N="332" REF="342">friend&s;hip, which if it does not level all di&s;tinction of mere property, making obliga|tion impo&s;&s;ible on either &s;ide, and render a refu&s;al to receive from the one what may be nece&s;&s;ary to the accommodation of the other, a breach of union, it amounts to nothing.&mdash;I do not think very highly of human profe&s;&s;ions, or of human practices; for I have felt the fallacy of both!"&mdash;He &s;ighed&mdash;"But as a brother I demand your acceptance of the powers with which the&s;e papers will inve&s;t you."&mdash;He gave a pac|quet.&mdash; "I have, from this moment, nothing to do with it: in&s;tructions as to the for|malities will be found enclo&s;ed. There is a blank &s;pace, and your heart, without my in&s;truction, will tell you how to fill it up."</P>
<P>John perceived Henry getting into what he was wont to call his enthu&s;ia&s;ticks. The emotion of his full heart had for &s;ome time coloured his cheek, his eye flamed with more than poetic lu&s;tre, and the ec&s;tacy was ju&s;t bur&s;ting from his tremu|lous lips, when his tongue refu&s;ed to give
<PB N="333" REF="343">it voice, and, after the &s;truggle of a mo|ment, he fell upon his brother's neck and wept.</P>
<P>John was by no means unmoved. Even to his firm &s;oul it had been a trying day. James, who had been ab&s;ent during the above di&s;cour&s;e, now entered. "My dear Henry," &s;aid John, "we live in a world in which it is our duty to correct rather than to indulge &s;en&s;ibility. Your affections, my Henry, are too general."&mdash;Here John pre&s;&s;ed his brother's hand to his bo&s;om.&mdash; "They magnify objects beyond what they can bear; they give to actions which are, in truth, no more than the re&s;ults of common hone&s;ty, and ju&s;t thinking, an importance which they are by no means entitled to. Brother, I love you, but you often grieve, and &s;ometimes di&s;plea&s;e me. Few of the greate&s;t events in human life would ju&s;tify the feeling excited in your mind by the mo&s;t trifling; and this exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation confounds the di&s;tinction which &s;hould be made betwixt what is &s;mall and what is great. There is, my brother, in the con|&s;truction
<PB N="334" REF="344">of this poor panting heart of yours enough of irritation to make up half a dozen feveri&s;h young ladies, who reckon an hectic of the heart among&s;t their charms. In them it is u&s;ually affectation; in you, I know, it is nature; and therefore to be deplored.</P>
<P>"It is too true," &s;aid James, taking part in the conver&s;ation&mdash;"you have no &s;obriety, no temperance in your emotions, my dear Henry: your pains or plea&s;ures are all ex|ce&s;&s;ive: you want moderation."</P>
<P>"Apathy, apathy! would have been your better word, brother," &s;aid Henry; "This, I confe&s;s to you, I do want, and of which I hope for ever to be de&s;titute: I cannot be indifferent; there is no cold medium in my nature.&mdash;Countle&s;s are the objects, which, by the majority of mankind, thought im|portant, pa&s;s by me unnoticed, or noted, only to be de&s;pi&s;ed. Power, place, gran|deur, titles, and all the pur&s;uits to which they lead, the authority which they give in &s;ociety when they are &s;ucce&s;sful, and the di&s;grace which attends their di&s;appointment, I hold of &s;o little account in the e&s;timate of
<PB N="335" REF="345">my happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, that truly I never had a &s;mile or &s;igh to be&s;tow upon them, and herein only con&s;i&s;ts my apathy."</P>
<P>"I return you my be&s;t thanks," &s;aid John, bowing ironically, "for your having added a new hypothe&s;is to the old, and be|fore imperfect &s;y&s;tem of ethics. Nothing &s;hort of a genius like yours, could have ren|dered a total di&s;regard of tho&s;e cau&s;es, which are acknowledged to work the weal or woe of the majority of mankind, compatible with the &s;ocial principle, on which I have, &s;o fre|quently heard you expatiate, or with the character of one, who is ambitious of being thought a philanthropi&s;t. You will have the candour to impute it to the true cau&s;e, my ignorance in the refinements of morality; and I own that I knew not, until &s;o great a ma&s;ter in&s;tructed me, the art of uniting in the &s;ame character the apathi&s;t and the lover of mankind."</P>
<P>"The thru&s;t," returned Henry, "di&s;|covers more vigilance than &s;kill. I mu&s;t repeat, that I am an apathi&s;t&mdash;only, in mo&s;t
<PB N="336" REF="346">of tho&s;e things which &s;tir the affections of many other men, and on which depend all their glory, and all their &s;hame. But is this avowing an indifference to the happy or fatal effects, in which &s;o many thou&s;ands of human beings around me are involved? Does it imply, that I behold with total di&s;regard the meteors of ambition as they ri&s;e or fall? the man of power rai&s;ed in one day to the &s;ummit of popular favour, and on another, &s;unk to the centre with public di&s;grace? Does it in&s;inuate, that I can ob&s;erve the turns of life, which, whether &s;udden and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, or by &s;low and &s;ubtle gradations, level with the du&s;t tho&s;e fabricks of happine&s;s, fame or fortune, which promi&s;ed to the artificers a &s;helter from every &s;torm? or, does it ren|der me in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e tran&s;itions, from hope to de&s;pair, from health to &s;ickne&s;s, from life to death,&mdash;tran&s;itions, which in the whirl of pur&s;uit, often &s;top the great and powerful in their mid-career? &s;urely, not! It implies only, that there are other griefs into which my affections enter with more
<PB N="337" REF="347">intere&s;t, and more concern. To detail the&s;e would be as endle&s;s as are the varieties of mi&s;ery by which they are induced.&mdash;The now joyful wife, for in&s;tance, exulting in her progeny, but reduced by one di&s;a&s;trous &s;troke to a mourning widow: her children deprived, in a moment, of their only &s;tay, and made orphans. The wicked man in|ve&s;ted with the &s;poils of the virtuous: tho&s;e &s;ons and daughters of mi&s;ery, who&s;e tears are &s;hed, and who&s;e &s;truggles are made for life in its mo&s;t humble vale, where whole fami|lies are crouded together, far removed from the path of ambition, and are only likely to be found&mdash;for I &s;peak not of loud and querel|ous mi&s;ery,&mdash;by him who has lei&s;ure to ex|plore the haunts of the needy and the afflicted. My wandering di&s;po&s;ition, or, if you will, my in&s;en&s;ibility of what has re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charms for the generality of mankind, often con|ducts me to &s;uch rece&s;&s;es, where I have not &s;eldom di&s;covered a kind of di&s;tre&s;s, for which the benevolence of my country, large and liberal as it is, has made no provi&s;ion; a
<PB N="338" REF="348">di&s;tre&s;s not known by the ordinary &s;ymptoms; tru&s;t me, my brother, there be wants and &s;orrows which have no di&s;play, which fly to the deepe&s;t &s;hades of the country, or mo&s;t unob&s;erved nooks and corners of a great city, not to conceal guilt, but to e&s;cape 'the whips and &s;corns o' th' time.' Misfortune has her victims, which yet the world 'know not of.'&mdash;Where is the a&s;ylum for the heart|broken being, who is &s;inking under the accumulation of indigence and wrongs&mdash;a &s;tarving progeny around him?&mdash;or for the man of high birth and proud feelings, who has &s;olicited, but cannot be importunate, and who is mouldering in his ruins? Or, again; for the martyr of genero&s;ity, who, too ten|der for re&s;entment, and too delicate for &s;trife, has been con&s;trained to quit the &s;eats of ho&s;|pitality, where all were welcome, and where all re&s;orted, for the de&s;olate hut of famine, which has the &s;olitude of the tomb? Or for the haple&s;s female who has &s;acrificed to her credulity, perhaps, to an exce&s;&s;ive virtue in her heart, but lo&s;t nothing of that nice &s;en&s;e
<PB N="339" REF="349">of &s;hame, which is &s;harper than a &s;erpent's tooth? Can the ho&s;pitals or magdalen hou&s;es of our country 'medicine to minds <HI>thus</HI> di&s;ea&s;ed?' To &s;uch, tho&s;e hou&s;es would be in&s;ult, di&s;grace, and wor&s;e than death. The hiding places of &s;uch unfortunates mu&s;t be &s;ought, even with the zeal with which you, my brother, have &s;ought and penetrated them;&mdash;&s;ought &s;ometimes among&s;t the abodes of the captive, but much oftener in tho&s;e retirements le&s;s accommodated than a pri&s;on, but far more &s;acred. Dear is liberty, and dreadful its lo&s;s; but the degrees of human &s;ufferance can only be determined by the nature and con&s;titution of the &s;ufferer; and it may po&s;&s;ibly happen, that the only re|maining ble&s;&s;ing which freedom has to be&s;tow on the wretched, is the power of choo&s;ing its cell."</P>
<P>"I am proud," rejoined James, "to claim alliance with the heart from whence &s;uch &s;en|timents proceed. I feel a &s;ort of triumph to think that the blood, which grows warmer in my veins at the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, flows from the &s;ame &s;ource; but I mu&s;t &s;till regret, that
<PB N="340" REF="350">extreme &s;en&s;ibility, like yours, has, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, my Henry, a natural bias rather to woe than joy; that where a temper di&s;|po&s;ed, or, to continue the phra&s;e, ble&s;&s;ed with a natural promptitude to chearfulne&s;s rather than to gloom, will extract the honey, yours will di&s;til the poi&s;on of life!"</P>
<P>"Say rather," exclaimed John, "this flying in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s from man, who is the proper protector of man; this getting into holes and corners to weep and to wail, is rarely warranted by the unfortunate; and &s;uch places are oftener the receptacles of fugitive guilt, than of retiring virtue in di&s;|tre&s;s; be&s;ides this, more real good, I am per&s;uaded, is to be done by the philanthro|pi&s;t, and more advantage to be received by the unhappy, be the cau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s what it may, in the open paths of life, than by &s;kulking into its lanes and alleys. Of virtuous di&s;tre&s;s no man ought to be a&s;hamed; and misfortune never can be contemptible but by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving it. In adver|&s;ity, the mind of the &s;ufferer is always the fir&s;t to degrade it&s;elf; and the world, my
<PB N="341" REF="351">dear Henry, the world is the proper &s;phere, not only for benevolence, but for its ob|jects."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Generally, no doubt," &s;aid Henry, "but in the particular ca&s;es I have de&s;cribed, and in numberle&s;s others, men of the world could never <HI>know</HI> many of the&s;e objects. They &s;hun di&s;covery, and can be explored only by &s;uch roving di&s;po&s;itions as my own; and to find them is, perhaps, the highe&s;t delight&mdash; melancholy, indeed, as &s;weet&mdash;of &s;uch di&s;|po&s;itions. I will confe&s;s to you, that public ambition never felt a joy from the attainment of its favourite aim more &s;incere, than that which I experience, when my rambles bring me within view of the mi&s;ery, which may be removed with le&s;s co&s;t than would pur|cha&s;e one of the trappings of ambition&mdash; even its feathers;&mdash;yet, were I a man of the world, I might not be di&s;po&s;ed, perhaps, to dive&s;t my&s;elf of one of tho&s;e feathers."</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding all this, dear youth," re&s;umed John, affectionately, but fervently, "this but half acquits you; it is performing
<PB N="342" REF="352">but part of the duty of a &s;ocial being: it is not enough that you weep with tho&s;e that weep."</P>
<P>"I had but half acquitted my&s;elf," &s;aid Henry, warmly, "but you are always, my brother, in arms again&s;t me: Ever on guard with your &s;word drawn, and your eye on the watch for an opening where you may &s;trike: On the &s;ame principle, that I feel for the unhappy, or, borrowing the &s;acred language you have quoted&mdash;'as I weep with tho&s;e that weep, I rejoice with tho&s;e that rejoice:' The felicity of others is, by vibration, my own; I feel their good fortune or good &s;ucce&s;s, though brought about by means, I &s;hould never, in my own ca&s;e, even had I been driven from all my own congenial &s;upports, have taken, nay, which I certainly &s;hould, in any extremity, have rejected; or, to &s;peak yet more clo&s;e, which, being un|congenial, never would have pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to <HI>me</HI> as means of this &s;ucce&s;s, and not being adapted to my ta&s;te and temper could have afforded me no happine&s;s; con|&s;equently,
<PB N="343" REF="353">their mi&s;carriage not being in my li&s;t of evils, could inflict upon me no mi&s;ery: in &s;hort, cau&s;e or effect would be alike matter of indifference. Yet, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that minds of another conformation &s;hould con|&s;ider <HI>that</HI> as their chief good, or ill, which would thus be lo&s;t upon me; and therefore, I am never di&s;plea&s;ed when my own pains and plea&s;ures, except on principles of general con&s;ideration, &s;hould be to them objects of no import. When I declare, for in&s;tance, that the mo&s;t minute, and to others, perhaps, imperceptible &s;light, or re&s;erve, from a friend into who&s;e bo&s;om I have been u&s;ed to pour my confidence; when I avow that a look, a word, or even a &s;ilence, that has but the &s;emblance of coldne&s;s or un|kindne&s;s;&mdash; when I confe&s;s, the&s;e are among&s;t my &s;carcely-&s;upportable grievances; and that the rever&s;e of the&s;e, in all their nice di&s;tinctions, are among&s;t my highe&s;t joys: when I furthermore confe&s;s"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Brother, brother!" exclaimed John, impatiently, "you have already confe&s;&s;ed too much; it is by nur&s;ing this &s;ickly kind
<PB N="344" REF="354">of &s;en&s;ibility, you have acquired that &s;orene&s;s of mind, which not only &s;hrinks at the touch, but induces you to imagine that aim is taken at your honour and happine&s;s, when the very rever&s;e may be intended, or when, more probably, you are not at all involved in the que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"Per&s;ons of our brother's vivacity &s;hould always have the plea&s;ures of imagination in the check of more &s;olid avocations," inter|po&s;ed James,&mdash;"avocations, which in&s;i&s;t on a certain degree of daily attention. Men of genius &s;hould, if the commixture were prac|ticable, be al&s;o men of bu&s;ine&s;s; they &s;hould vigorou&s;ly engage in &s;ome liberal employ|ment, that might connect the ornamental with the u&s;eful part of character: this would, perforce, abate that feveri&s;h irritation digni|fied with the name of exqui&s;ite feeling: a &s;plendid vapour, my Henry, which is the parent of half our modern di&s;orders of body and of &s;oul. There is an intoxication in fancy which di&s;dains the &s;obriety of rea&s;on; ever agitated, ever in pur&s;uit, yet over|taking nothing that is worthy the cha&s;e:&mdash;
<PB N="345" REF="355">behold, &s;uch is the hi&s;tory of your &s;elf|devoted men of fine feeling and exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility!"</P>
<P>"And I, you think, am one of that de|&s;cription?" que&s;tioned Henry.&mdash;"Decided|ly," replied John, with firmne&s;s, yet with feeling; "can you believe that your cha|racter, your happine&s;s, and your con&s;equence in life, my amiable brother, nay more, your value to the community, would not have all been gainers had you employed tho&s;e talents, which God has intru&s;ted to you, in a different way from the bu&s;y idlene&s;s to which they have been dedicated? Genius, and integrity, like yours, had they been engaged in any of the&s;e mu&s;t have made you long ere this as eminent as e&s;timable; and this, believe me, might, in your ca&s;e, have been done without becoming the &s;lave of that &s;en&s;ele&s;s am|bition, or frivolous grandeur, on which, per|haps, &s;omewhat too much, in the common cant of ordinary morali&s;ts, you have de|claimed. In the &s;cenes of honourable action you would have had no time to lie in wait for opportunities of mi&s;con&s;truction; your eye
<PB N="346" REF="356">would have been fixed on nobler objects, your fancy would have been under the controul of your judgment; it would then have been an auxiliary to rea&s;on her&s;elf; it would have given to the force of your eloquence an amiable fire that would, at the &s;ame time, have warmed and illumined your &s;ubjects: tho&s;e &s;ubjects too, would have been worthy of your powers; your genius would have expanded; your mind would have acquired a fortitude not to have been carried into &s;udden exce&s;&s;es, &s;o fatally cheri&s;hed by your pre&s;ent train of &s;tudies and habits: I beg pardon, it is this moment only that a ray of Henry's brighter genius has enabled me to &s;ee, James, that we are both in an error:&mdash;how can we have lived &s;o long in the blunder of believing that the pride of talents was inde|pendent of adventitious aids; and that &s;uch independence con&s;i&s;ted in firmne&s;s of mind, deci&s;ion of thought, and actions formed upon the&s;e? No &s;uch thing! genius, I find, &s;ub|jects its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the caprice of every trifling ca&s;ualty, renders him a minute inter|preter of looks, makes him di&s;&s;ect words,
<PB N="347" REF="357">and analize &s;ilence it&s;elf; drives him from the chearful abodes of men, into an alliance with &s;ubordinate beings; makes him fly from friends and relations, his proper com|forters, to beg the fellow&s;hip of birds and bea&s;ts; throws him on the alms even of inanimate nature; takes him out of all de|pendence, and reverence for him&s;elf; and places him wholly in the power of others. Proud and ble&s;&s;ed Independence! that re|duces &s;oul and body to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery! how I regret that my &s;tubborn nature cannot &s;toop to &s;uch happy &s;ervi|lity!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Alas, my brothers!" exclaimed Henry, &s;triking his bo&s;om, "I rather &s;tand in need of con&s;olation than cen&s;ure,&mdash;of your pity, than your rigour, or your ridicule."</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t Henry," an&s;wered John, much moved, "let not what I found, long &s;ince, a &s;corpion in my bo&s;om, be a viper in yours. Fable has not given to the ungrateful &s;nake &s;o fell a tooth as the &s;miling mi&s;chief which you cheri&s;h in your bo&s;om, and call &s;en&s;i|bility. Let me conjure you then; to cir|cum&s;cribe
<PB N="348" REF="358">its power, and if it is one of the tyrants in your blood, con&s;ider it like the 'lurking principle of death,' which, one of your poets has told us, is mixed up in our frame, &s;ooner or later to con&s;ume what it feeds on: or, if you love the delu&s;ion of &s;till thinking it your friend,&mdash;for, alas! like all favourites, it has but too many powers of recommending it&s;elf,&mdash;teach it only to glow at what is really great or good: and let it not prompt you to the inju&s;tice of conferring on the mean, the honours that belong only to the illu&s;trious.&mdash;I do not chide, my dear Henry, I only coun&s;el," added John; "but if you think I have too much rebuked the power, which I &s;ee is the favourite denizen of this bo&s;om,"&mdash;laying his hand on Henry's heart,&mdash;"if you think I have been too hard on this &s;en&s;ibility, let me atone for my cen|&s;ure by a ju&s;t applau&s;e."</P>
<P>James, being &s;ummoned on bu&s;ine&s;s, had withdrawn.</P>
<P>"One object there is on which this &s;en&s;i|bility may employ all its blandi&s;hments:&mdash; When it feduces my brother from him&s;elf&mdash;
<PB N="349" REF="359">when it makes him forget that a parent's and a brother's life is intru&s;ted to his charge; when it</P>
<P>'Wa&s;tes its &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;ert air,'&mdash; you &s;ee I have caught the &s;pirit of your mu&s;e, though, by the bye, &s;he &s;ometimes leads you into errors;&mdash;then I mu&s;t quarrel with it:&mdash; but, when it leads your bounding heart to pay to Olivia what is &s;o abundantly her due;&mdash; when it urges you to do homage to the beauty, innocence and love, &s;he has in &s;tore for you, I am reconciled to its full dominion over you: I blame not even the tears it makes you &s;hed, nor the enthu&s;ia&s;m it excites, even if it draws from my own eyes, or exacts from my own feelings, &s;uch &s;ympathies as give me the &s;uffering without the recompence, the wound without the balm; though, whatever may be the wounds of John, they can never want a balm while Henry and Olivia are happy!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLV.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN, in the cour&s;e of his philipic again&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, exhibited many &s;igns that, while he was rea&s;oning as a philo&s;opher, he felt as a man. James had only followed the even tenor of his reflections.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e, John appeared to be &s;eized with one of tho&s;e &s;udden and &s;trong contentions within, which &s;ometimes &s;ecluded him from his family and friends. More than one dire cau&s;e contributed to this; but the greate&s;t was impenetrably clo&s;ed from every eye but that which &s;earches the heart.</P>
<P>An ebullition of this kind in the mind of John Fitorzton, was frequently attended by that bilious mi&s;ery which &s;o often turns the whole ma&s;s of blood; and in him would produce a confinement of &s;ome days, during which he would admit no witne&s;s of its effects; nor, till the confinement was pa&s;t, would he reunite him&s;elf to &s;ociety. Then he would come forth, an
<PB N="351" REF="361">obvious victim of the ravage that had been made. The extremes of plea&s;ure or of pain would produce more or le&s;s this bo&s;om contention. The &s;tudy of his whole life had been to manage him&s;elf in the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, to which he was but too con&s;cious his di&s;|po&s;ition was prone; and when, as was in &s;ome in&s;tances the ca&s;e, his be&s;t endeavours failed, he fervently offered up a prayer that to human efforts might be added divine aids for the government of his nature.</P>
<P>His re&s;entment was rarely implacable: for although no earthly power could make him return his hand to any from whom he had withdrawn it, on conviction of unprincipled offences; it was not unu&s;ual with him to &s;erve tho&s;e, on impul&s;es of general compa&s;&s;ion, with whom he would never more a&s;&s;ociate. His immitigability was indeed chiefly confined to him&s;elf. It was there principally he inverted the ordi|nary laws of &s;elf-love, by &s;everely, though &s;ilently, becoming a &s;elf-accu&s;er; and &s;ome &s;en&s;ations which accompanied the delivery
<PB N="352" REF="362">of the &s;entiments that concluded his addre&s;s to his brother, returned on him &s;uch accu|&s;ation.</P>
<P>Henry, on the contrary, though on the fir&s;t receipt of an injury, he was tumultu|ous, vehement, and &s;udden, if, after tho&s;e impul&s;es had &s;ub&s;ided, any palliative pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, by which the cau&s;e of his wrongs, even by a little &s;train upon can|dour, could be imputable to misfortune, to the pre&s;&s;ure of hurrying events, or indeed to any thing but cold and meditated ba&s;e|ne&s;s, he would forget how far the effect had operated again&s;t his own feeling or intere&s;t, and be the fir&s;t to &s;eek accommo|dation.</P>
<P>So touched was the ingenuous youth by the affecting and affectionate <HI>manner,</HI> as well as <HI>matter,</HI> of his brother, in this admonitory di&s;|cour&s;e, that though he was unable to &s;peak from a certain mixture of awe, re&s;pect, and attention, he looked all that could denote at once a grateful and an afflicted heart. But collecting him&s;elf a little towards the con|clu&s;ion, and when John had, by degrees,
<PB N="353" REF="363">opened his arms to give to his la&s;t words the impre&s;&s;ion of an embrace.&mdash;"O my brother!" exclaimed Henry, "that you could de&s;cend into this overburthened heart!&mdash;that you could &s;ee, or that I could tell you&mdash;that it were permitted me&mdash;that I dare to di&s;clo&s;e."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Dare!" cried John, re&s;i&s;ting a &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition that had nearly &s;unk him at Henry's feet:&mdash;"Does that heart then con|tain any thing it dares not unfold? A Fitz|orton can fear nothing&mdash;but him&s;elf!"&mdash; The death-like palene&s;s which had the moment before u&s;urped the cheeks of John, now &s;eemed tran&s;po&s;ed to tho&s;e of Henry.&mdash; "That expre&s;&s;ion would almo&s;t ju&s;tify me, in the belief of a tale which has been poured into my ear," re&s;umed John, "re|&s;pecting Henry Fitzorton; a tale of &s;o incre|dible a nature, that I renounced it as a vile a&s;per&s;ion; nay, concluding it &s;uch, I &s;topt its progre&s;s."</P>
<P>"A tale!" que&s;tioned his brother, with confu&s;ion too mighty to be concealed,
<PB N="354" REF="364">"&s;urely I have a right to know the accu|&s;ation, and the accu&s;er!</P>
<P>"The accu&s;er," replied John, throwing his examining eye over Henry, "is the terror of the per&s;on accu&s;ed."</P>
<P>"That terror is of John's creation. It is not the fir&s;t time we have &s;een innocence aba&s;hed, and misfortune appalled in the pre|&s;ence of John Fitzorton:"&mdash;here the ro&s;es began to revi&s;it Henry's cheek.&mdash;"Yet have I beheld even John him&s;elf &s;truggling with emotions which, to any one unacquainted with the purity of his heart, might have &s;ubjected him to the cen&s;ure of men who, like him&s;elf, are di&s;po&s;ed to judge hardly.&mdash; I have &s;een him wrought into agony, his very &s;pirit on the rack; he has thrown into every countenance, and &s;unk into every bo&s;om, a &s;adne&s;s like his own. In the mid&s;t of this painful &s;ympathy he has left friends, brothers, parents, without explanation: has re&s;i&s;ted the &s;oftne&s;s of one, the authority of another, and the wi&s;hes of all; and when has <HI>his</HI> &s;ilence been imputed to guilt? when
<PB N="355" REF="365">have the effects been attributed to his not daring to di&s;cover the cau&s;e?"</P>
<P>It is, indeed, true, that it would be im|po&s;&s;ible for an aggre&s;&s;or, or for any per&s;on he conceived to be &s;uch, to &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of John Fitzorton, without feeling more terror in his &s;ilence than in the mo&s;t rending climaxes of Henry's indignation. It was an awful dumbne&s;s, which di&s;mayed the very &s;oul, and when, at the end of this tremendous pau&s;e, he at la&s;t &s;poke, the &s;en|tence which he pa&s;t upon the action, was bitter, and commonly brief; as if the &s;ud|den death of the offender were to be pro|nounced and executed in the &s;ame moment. Yet, how &s;hall we find cen&s;ure for emotions which, whether excited again&s;t others or him&s;elf, were emotions of a mind zealous in the cau&s;e of hone&s;ty? and if we admit that the paroxy&s;ms which attended them were the vices of his blood, we mu&s;t allow al&s;o that they aro&s;e from the virtues of his heart.</P>
<P>Sometimes however, before he had done &s;peaking to Henry, the agitated, yet then
<PB N="356" REF="366">empa&s;&s;ioned John, began to droop: his ingenuous &s;oul felt force of his brother's remarks: and, &s;elf-condemned, he advanced to Henry, from whom he had receded, and pre&s;enting his hand, he &s;aid, with a voice humbled even to penitence, "It is but ju&s;t I &s;hould offer what perhaps it is no le&s;s right you &s;hould refu&s;e: Henry forgive me! I have thrown your tender di&s;po&s;ition into confu&s;ion, and puni&s;hed you for my own fault. My nature and my habits are &s;tern. I will try to mend them. How came &s;o har&s;h a being to be a brother of yours, my Henry? I have my &s;oftne&s;s too&mdash;&s;ometimes: I have not always been the knotted oak; I have even been weaker than the bending reed; and it is indeed true that you have never chid me for it; nor have you even &s;uppo&s;ed, as I did, that my want of confi|dence has been the want of honour: I am unworthy of your pardon!"</P>
<P>As he was withdrawing his hand, Henry caught it with all the eagerne&s;s of fraternal love, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips; then &s;pread|ing his arms he exclaimed, "O my dear,
<PB N="357" REF="367">dear brother! you are worthy of every thing: this&mdash;ah, how long has it been de|&s;ired! &mdash;this is the moment&mdash;this is the &s;itua|tion," &mdash;drawing John &s;till more clo&s;ely to his embrace&mdash;"when I am to convince my beloved John, if I have not dared to"&mdash;</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is, Olivia came into the garden. Powerful, indeed, mu&s;t be the pencil that could colour her feelings at this joyful &s;ight! While the brothers were yet enfolded in each others arms, &s;he &s;oftly encircled her own around them both; and with accents that might, indeed, melt <Q>Contending nations into brotherhood,</Q>
She reiterated the expre&s;&s;ion which had before ended an affectionate &s;trife <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the celebration of her birth-day.</NOTE>, "ble&s;s! ble&s;s ye together!"</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t," &s;aid Olivia, "I had forgot my errand, which was to inform you dinner waited, but this richer banquet for my heart had obliviated every other."&mdash;"To dinner then with what appetite we may," &s;aid John
<PB N="358" REF="368">&s;miling, but not without an half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;igh, as he re&s;igned the hand of Olivia to Henry. "Nay, cried Olivia, placing her&s;elf between the brothers, and pre&s;enting a hand to each, "are we not all united? I mu&s;t," added &s;he, playfully, "on this happy occa&s;ion go in all the &s;tate of my proud heart&mdash;&s;up|ported by the family arms!" In this manner they entered the ca&s;tle. But as True George opened the dining hall door: "We mu&s;t &s;eparate here," ob&s;erved John, "only two can go in at a time, and tho&s;e mu&s;t of cour&s;e be Henry and Olivia." As &s;oon as they had entered, John ordered George to clo&s;e the door; then traver&s;ing with hurried &s;teps the antechamber, George took it for granted that the "older young '&s;quire," as he &s;ometimes called him, was more agree|ably employed than if he were &s;eated at a good dinner, &s;o letting him&s;elf into the dining room to wait at table, left him with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, whi&s;pering, "Hu&s;h! hu&s;h! hang the door, how it creaks!"</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="369">At length, having made his exit, the hone&s;t dome&s;tic hinted to the family, that his honour, the philo&s;opher, was &s;uddenly taken with one of his <HI>coggibundu&s;&s;es,</HI> and he could &s;ee that his honour thought as little about dinner as if there was no &s;uch amu&s;ement as eating and drinking in the world.</P>

<P>JOHN'S &s;oliloquy was brief and pointed. &mdash;"It mu&s;t be done&mdash;and immediately. I am a fool to my own heart, and a knave to my brother's. I have been in mi&s;ery. Deci&s;ion is happine&s;s. I am de|cided."</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e &s;hort &s;entences was &s;poken walking, and each was performed in a long &s;tride. The word "deci&s;ion" brought him to the dining room door, which he opened with the firmne&s;s and energy of a man, who, after various debate of thought, and irre&s;olution of conduct, had determined.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="370">In the evening, the family as was cu&s;|&s;tomary, a&s;&s;embled in the library, where they frequently pa&s;&s;ed the evening in literary conver&s;ations. John had recovered the hue of his countenance; and even his &s;arca&s;tic &s;portivene&s;s returned to the general joy of the company; and, clouded as had been the day, it was an evening of family happine&s;s, in which even Henry was beguiled from the immediate memory of his di&s;appointments and perplexities.</P>
<P>In order to force his mind from other thoughts, which he felt would di&s;qualify him for that calm &s;eparation on which he was re&s;olved, John again opened his unexhau&s;ted artillery upon what he called the mon&s;tro|&s;ities of Poe&s;y and Romance; in reply to all which Sir Armine, taking part with Henry, plea&s;antly exclaimed, "Your pro&s;ing brother has again a&s;&s;ailed us unprovokedly, my Harry; it is now a common cau&s;e. I like you, have <HI>romanced</HI> and <HI>poeti&s;ed,</HI> and am invaded; and depend upon it, under the au&s;pices of in&s;ulted Phoebus, we &s;hall
<PB N="361" REF="371">rout this furious Drawcan&s;ir, 'Thou nature art our godde&s;s."&mdash;</P>
<P>"In&s;pired by her," interpo&s;ed Henry, taking up the theme as he always did, zea|lou&s;ly, "I in&s;i&s;t that a play, a poem, or romance, though &s;o ince&s;&s;antly the objects of my brother's ridicule, po&s;&s;ibly of his envy and de&s;pair, I maintain that either of the&s;e may become as u&s;eful to the intere&s;ts of virtue as the mo&s;t laboured di&s;qui&s;ition in the proud circle of philo&s;ophy; and on this &s;ubject I mu&s;t own, I have long wi&s;hed to obtain my dear father's more decided and circum&s;tantial opinion; becau&s;e, whether di&s;|couraging or favourable to my own, I &s;hould hear it with great deference; con&s;cious i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would be founded on true judgment, tem|pered by candour, which I take to be true critici&s;m."</P>
<P>"A critic, my Henry," &s;aid Sir Armine, "&s;hould be the guardian of the public ta&s;te, the public virtue, and the public happine&s;s; on all which public literature has an impor|tant influence."</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="372">"No doubt, &s;ir," cried John, "but tho&s;e effu&s;ions of a boiling head and feveri&s;h heart, denominated novels, of all &s;illy books, u&s;ually the mo&s;t &s;illy, the very names of which are become di&s;gu&s;ting, will not, I tru&s;t, be allowed by my father to con&s;ti|tute a part of public literature, although I have my fears, they may have contributed not a little to vitiate the public ta&s;te."</P>
<P>"We have not time, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to go back to the origin of romance; nor to trace its progre&s;s from the early ages to the pre&s;ent century, when it took the name of novel," &s;aid Sir Armine, re&s;i&s;t|ing his &s;on's ludicrous images with &s;ome gravity: "under all titles, however, and in all ages, from its epocha, this &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition has been con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t agreeable parts of literature: and although rigid morali&s;ts, mi&s;taken zealots, and indi&s;criminate &s;atiri&s;ts,"&mdash;Here Olivia and Henry looked full at John&mdash;"Affected ignorance," continued Sir Armine, "or more affected learning, have fulminated again&s;t it,
<PB N="363" REF="373">&s;till does it remain a &s;ource of great delight, not &s;eldom of as great utility."</P>
<P>"It appears to me, &s;ir," ob&s;erved Henry, kindling, "that compo&s;itions of &s;cience may be compared to the a&s;piring oak, and the works of fancy to the flowerets of the valley."</P>
<P>"Very true, brother," cried John,&mdash; "creeping like the latter among&s;t the hedges, or &s;linking into the bottom of the ditches; or, perhaps, timorou&s;ly peeping from the banks, as con&s;cious of their in&s;ignificance."</P>
<P>"No, brother," retorted Henry, ri&s;ing, and elevating his hands to illu&s;trate the image,&mdash;"not creeping among&s;t hedges, but blooming full in view;&mdash;a bloom immortal as the proude&s;t growth of the fore&s;ts, and carrying their odours even to the mountain top."</P>
<P>"A literary compo&s;ition," re&s;umed Sir Armine, "like a military operation, &s;hould be con&s;idered, whatever be its nature, in its con&s;tructions, its progre&s;s, and its con&s;um|mation. Both &s;hould be contemplated in
<PB N="364" REF="374">the felicity of the idea, the unity of the de&s;ign, and the energy of the execution. My Henry is &s;upported by the united wi&s;|dom of our ance&s;tors, who all concur in the mo&s;t favourable &s;entiment of a well-contrived work of the imagination: and the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious among&s;t the moderns have given the &s;uffrage of their names to a defence of the very books, which &s;en&s;ele&s;s witlings, affected coxcombs, or too rigid critics,&mdash;pardon me, dear John,"&mdash;Sir Armine had thrown a glance on his elde&s;t &s;on, as he pronounced the two la&s;t words,&mdash;"too rigid critics pre|&s;ume to contemn. One of the mo&s;t learned and elegant of tho&s;e moderns, indeed,&mdash;a dignitary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hurd.</NOTE> of the church too, John,&mdash;has ob&s;erved, that, in &s;pite of philo&s;ophy and fa&s;hion, Faery Spencer &s;till ranks highe&s;t among&s;t the poets; earth-born critics may bla&s;pheme, &s;ays he,
<Q REND="margQuotes">But all the Gods are ravi&s;h'd with delight Of his cele&s;tial &s;ong, and mu&s;ic's wond'rous might.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="375">"I believe, however," interpo&s;ed John, "that the high and reverend authority you have quoted, &s;ir, allows, that all the&s;e lying wonders of the Gothic magicians, the&s;e gri&s;ly &s;pectres rai&s;ed out of their own horror-creating fancies, when men loved to a&s;toni&s;h and affright them&s;elves, when every village had a gho&s;t, the church-yards were all haunted, and every large common had a circle of fairies belonging to it, were at the dawn of rea&s;on, but that her growing &s;plendour put them all to flight."</P>
<P>"True," returned Sir Armine, "there wanted a reform in the world of fiction, and the revolution of letters effected this by compelling fancy to league at lea&s;t with probability:&mdash;in the end &s;he became more obedient to the laws of nature; and, thus allied, the wildne&s;s and extravagance of the fable is cha&s;tened, and, as his lord &s;hip has expre&s;&s;ed it, the excellence of the moral, and the ingenuity of the contrivance, remained, after the magic of the old romances was perfectly di&s;&s;olved.&mdash;But he adds, what we
<PB N="366" REF="376">have got by this revolution is a great deal of good &s;en&s;e: what we have lo&s;t is a world of fine fabling&mdash;the illu&s;ion of which is &s;o grateful to the charmed &s;pirit."</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid Olivia, who had been ex|tremely attentive, as indeed had the whole party, "&s;urely, that charmed &s;pirit, in its cha&s;tened &s;tate, walks the world at this day, and can no longer be called unnatural or romantic. Takes it not a &s;hape to reform, while it alarms, in many an antique dome and aweful fore&s;t?&mdash;In the&s;e, it is, methinks, a &s;pirit rai&s;ed by genius in the cau&s;e of vir|tue. It comes like a benign angel to guard and warn the good, or like a threat|ning demon to terrify and puni&s;h the wicked. It is con&s;cience per&s;onified: I con&s;ider it with a fond and &s;acred plea&s;ure, mixed with a religious dread; but, at the &s;ame time, I hold in contempt tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary and wanton, as well as impertinent apparitions, which the vulgar noveli&s;t conjures up merely to terrify his readers; to &s;et before their eyes a literary maukin to &s;care and &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;
<PB N="367" REF="377">avaunt &s;uch childi&s;h vi&s;ions!&mdash;vani&s;h &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s &s;pectres!&mdash;What are the pages in which they are &s;aid to groan and &s;talk, but fables of di&s;gu&s;ting mon&s;ters, like the re|po&s;itories of wild bea&s;ts, where curio&s;ity is at once attracted and terrified by frightful deformities? But I cannot endure that the&s;e &s;hould have the honour to be cla&s;&s;ed with the productions I have de&s;cribed before."</P>
<P>John had &s;everal times looked towards Olivia while &s;he was &s;peaking, with approv|ing eyes: and Henry had as frequently taken her hand. Mr. Clare, and the re&s;t of the families, were always plea&s;ed whenever her mode&s;t talents could be brought into di&s;|play.</P>
<P>Sir Armine and Henry intreated her to pro|ceed. "Alas" &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing, "from my own &s;canty &s;tores I have nothing worth offering, but in the &s;en&s;ible Euphra&s;ia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clara Reeve.</NOTE> I have found the mo&s;t convincing arguments, drawn up in the mo&s;t agreeable language.
<PB N="368" REF="378">She informs me, that romances were the de|light of barbarous ages, and that they have always kept their ground among&s;t the mul|tiplied amu&s;ements of more refined and cul|tivated periods; containing, like every other branch of human literature, both good and evil things. The&s;e, as nearly as I can re|member, are her own words. You will ea&s;ily believe," continued Olivia, &s;peaking to Sir Armine, and looking at his younge&s;t &s;on with eyes that told her &s;atisfaction, "that I was charmed to find the in&s;tructive Euphra&s;ia expre&s;&s;ing an a&s;toni&s;hment, I have &s;o often felt my&s;elf, that men of &s;en&s;e and learning, who reli&s;h the beauties of the old cla&s;&s;ic poets, and dwell on them with &s;uch fond admiration, &s;hould be indifferent to, or &s;peak contemptuou&s;ly of the romance; for its &s;tories are not more wild and incredible than the mo&s;t admired epic."</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid Henry, with emotion, "&s;urely it is to a moral purpo&s;e the aweful &s;cenery of times long pa&s;t is di&s;played; we cannot look back upon them, even in the&s;e
<PB N="369" REF="379">enlightened days, without &s;omething of a con&s;cience-born emotion: vice reads with terror and di&s;may, as if &s;he &s;aw the menacing phantom; virtue peru&s;es them with that holy fear which is the be&s;t guard of firm, yet unpre&s;uming innocence."</P>
<P>"It appears to me," &s;aid Olivia, diffi|dently, "that to remove the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition, and the blind or wilful violation of nature, were the great points of reform mo&s;t wanted in the ancient romance, pre|&s;erving and <HI>meliorating</HI> the &s;acred effects of the holy fear my Henry has mentioned."</P>
<P>Olivia then went to that &s;ide of the library which &s;he and Henry had arranged and ap|propriated, and where might be &s;een every truly ingenious production of the &s;pecies in que&s;tion, as well of olden times as of the&s;e our days, and in all languages; but more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of her own country and &s;ex <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had Olivia brought down her eulogy nearer the date of this publication, &s;he would inevitably have a&s;&s;ign|ed a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in her library to an illu&s;trious train of Engli&s;h women, the literary magi of the pre&s;ent day. Among&s;t the&s;e would have been found "Sir Ber|tram's Patrone&s;s;" and the fair advocate who, &s;upported by her OLD BARON, &s;o well illu&s;trated the cau&s;e &s;he has ably defended: and the enchantre&s;s of Udolpho, potent alike to terrify as to tran&s;port; the magician of the MA|NOR-HOUSE, honoured and loved by the mu&s;e. COWLEY, conferring fre&s;h honours on a name which genius had before appreciated. The elegant parent of EVELINA too. And &s;he, al&s;o, in who&s;e genius we have found the &s;trokes of another PERU. The painter of 'Art and Nature' likewi&s;e, with the &s;oft yet &s;ublime defender of woman's rights, and &s;he who told &s;o well a "Tale of other Times." The&s;e would all have been &s;ubjects of our heroine's eulogy. And thou, con&s;oler and arbi|ter of the heart! generous enthu&s;ia&s;t, and advocate of genius, even to a romantic chivalry! yes, thou LAURA MARIA, who ha&s;t ennobled thy&s;elf by "the unperi&s;hable lu&s;tre of mental pre-eminence!" would have enriched the ca&s;tle with the varied offspring of an enlightened mind, a&s;&s;ociating the magic of the wand, with the enchantments of the lyre.</NOTE> The latter &s;he enumerated with a

<P>WHILE Henry and Olivia were en|gaged in their panegyric, and the re&s;t of the company li&s;tening to, or &s;urrounding them, John concealed &s;ome powerful emotions, and irregular movements and ge&s;tures, by leaving the room; and when he returned, he found his father, at the repeated urgency of his poeti|cal brother, proceeding in the conver&s;ation: John again &s;at down, and while he was a &s;ilent auditor, had opportunity to recover him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Who&s;oever propo&s;es to make amu&s;e|ment the mini&s;ter of in&s;truction," re&s;umed Sir Armine, "is like a mariner between two tremendous rocks. On this &s;ide he hath to encounter the pomps of learning, on that the affectations of vanity: both the&s;e pre|tending, with equal contumacy, to hold romances and novels in &s;corn. But there are few compo&s;itions which are not better
<PB N="372" REF="382">than the conver&s;ation of that ignorance which affects wi&s;dom, or of that learning which de&s;pi&s;es knowledge, through whatever chan|nels it may flow. Neverthele&s;s, I have ob|&s;erved the&s;e &s;agacious per&s;ons are &s;o wonder|fully gifted, as to anticipate every thing a book of this kind contains on the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of the title, and not, for&s;ooth, having time to wa&s;te on trifles, throw a&s;ide the &s;aid book; which appears to me ju&s;t as fair a proceeding as if a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, pretending to &s;ee fool or knave written on a man's fea|tures, &s;hould look in his face, expre&s;s his &s;u&s;picion, and knock him down."</P>
<P>"Alas, my father! there is no ju&s;tice in this," cried James; "while the being that &s;peculates, like the being which is &s;peculated upon, remains human, many of his fir&s;t-&s;ight judgments mu&s;t be que&s;tionable, whether he be a phy&s;iognomi&s;t of men or of books. The countenances of both are &s;ometimes, indeed, copious indexes, but &s;ometimes mere title-pages, in&s;omuch, that the mo&s;t pro|found ob&s;erver mu&s;t often be at fault: a very

<P>"But my &s;on James," rejoined Sir Ar|mine, "forgets that vanity has her votaries, both among&s;t the wi&s;e as well as the fair, the learned as the unlearned. As the former of the&s;e would blu&s;h to be caught with a book they wi&s;h the world to believe below their under&s;tanding, the latter often contrive to be &s;een at &s;tudies above their capacity; and it is plea&s;ant enough to ob&s;erve, both of them labouring to maintain a character, which neither can rea&s;onably hope to e&s;ta|bli&s;h."</P>
<P>"It is well known," continued James, "I am a determined foe to all extremes, and that becau&s;e almo&s;t every good&mdash;moral and

For which rea&s;on, methinks, &s;ome mark of &s;eparation &s;hould be made betwixt the authors who correctly imitate the works of nature, and tho&s;e who produce mon&s;trous compo&s;itions with which nature hath nothing to do: compo&s;itions that are run up with the &s;peed, but not with the inge|nuity of the &s;pider's web,&mdash;as ea&s;ily &s;wept away, and as &s;oon forgotten. But far apart, and honourably di&s;tinct from the&s;e, are the accurate delineations of very many romance writers of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent age, who&s;e reputation &s;hall endure with that of any hi&s;|torian, philo&s;opher, or poet. Indeed, if 'the proper &s;tudy of mankind be man,' the author who be&s;t de&s;cribes the human character and conduct, unfolds mo&s;t &s;kilfully the various mazes of life, and enters mo&s;t minutely into that which produces, and that which de&s;troys, dome&s;tic happine&s;s, is the mo&s;t u&s;eful author. Ab&s;tract rea&s;onings, philo&s;ophical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as "John cultivates, and the &s;ublimer &s;oarings of the mu&s;e, which are &s;o dear to
<PB N="376" REF="386">Henry, have genuine charms only for a few, and of the&s;e, &s;ome affect to admire what they neither can reli&s;h nor under&s;tand; but the hi&s;torian of private life, for to that name he &s;hould a&s;pire, paints &s;cenes and characters which are familiar to every man. To &s;ay the truth, what are the dome&s;tic annals of the whole world, my &s;ons, but &s;o many hi&s;tories of this kind, abounding with character, in|cident, and adventure? Every day affords matter for a new chapter, and every year &s;wells the work into another, merry or melancholy, volume; or rather a mi&s;cellany compounded of both.</P>
<P>"And, in point of that knowledge which equips us for the world, and opens, as it were, upon the under&s;tanding a window through which we may &s;ee the &s;ecret work|ings of the heart, I will oppo&s;e a well-drawn copy of life, in a &s;eries of natural adventures, to the proude&s;t &s;peculations of any of tho&s;e profound thinkers, the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of whom might imagine him&s;elf di&s;graced, were he compared with the <HI>be&s;t</HI> writers of that cla&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE conque&s;t which our young poetic enamorato &s;eemed to have gained by the favourite &s;entiments of his father, was now &s;o complete, that he could not help drawing John and his father into that compartment of the library which had been &s;acred to poe&s;y and romance, and which John had altered from 'Poets' to 'Trumpery corner,' and provokingly pa&s;ted tho&s;e words on the edge of the &s;helves with a caricature figure of Folly, laughing with her cap and bells, and boys on each &s;ide of her crying over them&mdash; "Victoria! victoria!" exclaimed he; "I hope now trumpery may be expunged&mdash; judgment, judgment, brother James! I tru&s;t the di&s;pute betwixt the&s;e men of &s;now, who call them&s;elves philo&s;ophers, and the children of the &s;un, who feel them&s;elves to be poets, is now &s;ettled:&mdash;what &s;ays the family Ballan|cer, &mdash;what &s;ays my judicial brother to this?"</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="389">"I have wondered at nothing more," re|plied James, "than at the unfair dealings of readers with authors."</P>
<P>"Authors with readers I believe you mean," quoth John.</P>
<P>"Rather," continued James, "it is mat|ter of &s;urpri&s;e to me, that con&s;idering the inju&s;tice of readers there &s;hould be any au|thors at all."</P>
<P>"Now you have mended it!" cried John.</P>
<P>"James has rea&s;on on his &s;ide, notwith|&s;tanding," &s;aid Sir Armine.</P>
<P>"It appears to me, Sir," an&s;wered James, re&s;pectfully, "that the <HI>golden mean</HI> finds as few friends among&s;t books as among men;&mdash; a certain extravagance pervades all things.&mdash; Every reader, more or le&s;s, exerci&s;es the tyranny of a critic, if the work hap|pens to be adapted to the degree of his capacity and modes of feeling, no panegyric &s;eems warm enough; if it be written above or below that capacity, tho&s;e modes, or dif|ferent from his general idea, or particular experience, or the temper of the moment,
<PB N="380" REF="390">there is not any cen&s;ure deemed &s;trong enough to condemn it.</P>
<P>"A morning I once pa&s;&s;ed in a London circulating library, illu&s;trates this whim&s;ically enough," ob&s;erved Mr. Clare, taking his pipe. "I do not often enter into the&s;e matters, you know; but I will endeavour to de&s;cribe what I heard, and &s;aw, at one of tho&s;e repo&s;itories of &s;en&s;e and non&s;en&s;e. 'Have you read &s;uch a performance?' cried one to his friend&mdash;coming in, arm in arm.&mdash;'I have dipped into it,' replied the friend, affecting the &s;cholar&mdash;'dull, Sir, very dull!"</P>
<P>"Thus is the wrong idea," continued James, "&s;pread abroad to the extent of that man's connections; the book is avoided, and its very name becomes contagious. On the other hand, it may, with as little rea&s;on, by the extravagance of ill-de&s;erved prai&s;e, be|come epidemical another way&mdash;too many &s;weets are as nau&s;eating as exce&s;&s;ive bit|ters."</P>
<P>"Were I to be de&s;perate enough to write another book," &s;aid Sir Armine, "methinks I would try a new experiment. I would
<PB N="381" REF="391">write up to the capacity and feeling of half a dozen per&s;ons, with who&s;e different di&s;|po&s;itions I had acquaintance: for argument's &s;ake, we will &s;uppo&s;e the characters to &s;tand thus&mdash;a philo&s;opher, a poet, a divine, a hu|mouri&s;t, a politician, and a man of the world; for each of whom I would prepare &s;ome e&s;&s;ay, treati&s;e, or poem, &s;uitable to their re|&s;pective genius. But, agreeably to the de&s;ign I had in view, I would &s;o arrange the&s;e, that, pre&s;uming each to be excellent in its kind, two very contrary effects &s;hould be produced by that arrangement. The book being ready, I would take care that the &s;ix per&s;ons for whom it was intended, &s;hould be &s;ummoned to a private recital, in a more fini&s;hed and &s;elect way than before. I would commence my experiments on the humouri&s;t, delineating that &s;ingularity, whim, or weakne&s;s in mind or manners, in which he would mo&s;t delight, but which my man of the world would pro|nounce 'execrable &s;tuff;" the philo&s;opher,&mdash; 'beneath the dignity of the human under|&s;tanding;' &mdash;the poet, 'de&s;picable;'&mdash;the divine, 'frivolous;'&mdash;the politician, 'ab|&s;urd.'
<PB N="382" REF="392">&mdash;I would then make an attempt upon the re&s;t indi&s;criminately, and &s;hould certainly find that the plea&s;ure of one, while his fa|vourite &s;ubject was before him, would have a nearly contrary effect on the others; until in the end, each man would depart with a favourable impre&s;&s;ion of the work, not be|cau&s;e it might be <HI>generally</HI> excellent, but becau&s;e the particular ta&s;te, and, perhaps, predominant pa&s;&s;ion of each had been grati|fied. &mdash;Were you the next day," continued Sir Armine, "to hear the philo&s;opher pa&s;&s;ing his opinion on the performance to any friends of his own de&s;cription, he would tell you there was one e&s;&s;ay worth all the re&s;t:&mdash;The bard would recommend it to his brethren of the laurel, purely for the poem: The poli|tician, for its happy &s;trokes at mini&s;try or the oppo&s;ition: The divine, for its polemics: The man of fa&s;hion, for its elegance in trifling; and the humouri&s;t, for that di&s;play of character, which, though &s;een every hour in life, is always welcome to men of his di&s;|po&s;ition, when found in books. Thus, if every book could be u&s;hered into the world
<PB N="383" REF="393">with &s;uch an experiment, the reading of it would be general: but my complaint is, that were &s;uch book to be placed in the way of &s;ix &s;uch readers <HI>&s;eparately,</HI> without a table of contents to anticipate the &s;ubjects, and &s;hould it happen that the order in which the book was opened, pre&s;ented the philo&s;ophy to the humouri&s;t,&mdash;the divinity to the man of fa&s;hion, the airy plea&s;antries to the di|vine, the politics to the bard, and the poetry to the politician, my poor book would call forth more vengeance again&s;t it, than was ever fulminated at a mi&s;erable culprit from that book of pious cur&s;es&mdash;the Romi&s;h ex|communication."</P>
<P>"Your quarrel with readers then, &s;ir," &s;aid James, quietly, "is for their want of candour, and of patience. You would wi&s;h them to begin di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, to &s;it down to their author with a mind di&s;po&s;ed to be plea&s;ed, and proceed to the end before they pa&s;&s;ed judgment. Ju&s;t as we do in legal af|fairs. And there ought to be courts of ju&s;tice, no doubt, in literature, as well as in law."</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="394">"Read books to the end, hey!" &s;aid Mr. Clare, having now filled and lighted his pipe: "I wi&s;h you could &s;ee the circulators at my friend Page's &s;hop, and hear Page de|&s;cribe his cu&s;tomers.

<P>Much amu&s;ement had been produced by Mr. Clare's report of Page's &s;hrewd account of his cu&s;tomers.&mdash;John clo&s;ed the conver|&s;ation by pre&s;&s;ing his brother Henry's hand, while he a&s;&s;ured him, that with whatever a&s;perity he might, &s;ometimes, have attacked his art, it had never been with de&s;ign to de&s;poil him of his laurel, or depreciate its value; but to &s;eparate it from the florid weeds with which it is too often &s;urrounded, and to make it, indeed, an immortal plant worthy to grace his brows.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="401">The triumph which Henry had before be|gun to feel from his father's &s;anction, was compleated in his brother's generous con|fe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But John Fitzorton had yet another theme to adju&s;t before the company withdrew, and the parting moment being at hand, he an|nounced his intention of joining his regiment on the morrow. "There is, indeed," &s;aid he, "an indecency, an ingratitude in being appointed to fill the place of the ever-lament|ed Lacelles, without endeavouring, at lea&s;t, to make my&s;elf acceptable to the &s;oldiers, who have lo&s;t the commander they &s;o ju&s;tly honoured and loved.</P>
<P>"We will here take leave, therefore, of one another, wi&s;hing, by way of toa&s;t to this brimmer of claret,&mdash;filling his gla&s;s,&mdash;that whatever alterations may take place, during my ab&s;ence, in the ca&s;tle of Fitzorton,&mdash; looking earne&s;tly at Olivia and Henry&mdash;may be for the better!"</P>
<P>After the company had quitted the &s;upper|room, John accompanied Henry up &s;tairs,
<PB N="392" REF="402">when taking his hand with great cordiality, he addre&s;&s;ed him thus:&mdash;"My brother, farewell!&mdash;cultivate your family; it loves you: cultivate your genius; cultivate;"&mdash;he he&s;itated,&mdash;turned pale,&mdash;attempted &s;peech, but failed.&mdash;"We will corre&s;pond," &s;aid he, &s;aintly, and pre&s;&s;ing his brother's hand while his own &s;hook; "yes, we will communi|cate by letter. I leave you in the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of unbounded happine&s;s,&mdash;I &s;ee how you are beloved, honoured, adored, and am &s;till &s;hocked to think I have ever admitted a doubt."&mdash;Saying this, he embraced Henry; repeated his farewell, and expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to be alone, he gently clo&s;ed Henry's apart|ment, went ha&s;tily into his own, and locked the door.</P>
<P>Thus was Henry deprived of another op|portunity to unfold him&s;elf; for he knew it would be a vain attempt to de&s;ire an audience with John, after he had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h of privacy.</P>
<P>It was, however, a &s;evere di&s;appointment. He had even anchored his be&s;t hopes upon
<PB N="393" REF="403">it; and though he had been dexterou&s;ly &s;educed into his &s;econd &s;ubject, the in&s;tant he reverted to him&s;elf he had anticipated the certainty of conver&s;ing with John as a point of infinite importance, and yet his anti|cipation was a mixture of fear and hope. But when the moment &s;o anxiou&s;ly expected, and &s;o hard to be attained,&mdash;on account of John's frequent ab&s;ence from the ca&s;tle&mdash;ar|rived, his brother's emotions, and re&s;olute tones, de&s;troyed his hope. "It is plain," &s;aid he, "he knows my cruel &s;ecret, and is di&s;|plea&s;ed, but unwilling to part in altercation, has tried by every way to avoid a rupture, and will di&s;clo&s;e him&s;elf by letter."</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal unea&s;y hours, he com|po&s;ed him&s;elf a little, on reflecting, that he &s;hould &s;till have the opportunity of which he had thus again been deprived, by catching John in the morning before he &s;et off. But here again he was prevented by, perhaps, the la&s;t impediment he would have thought could have been placed in his way. He fell into a doze which continued to hold him fa&s;t locked in the arms of Morpheus, not only
<PB N="394" REF="404">till the hour was pa&s;t at which John had ri&s;en, but till True George tapt at his chamber door, to acquaint him that the family waited breakfa&s;t for him. Yes, reader, wearied with turning his arguments, and oppre&s;&s;ed with the vigour with which he &s;upplied the ideal fire, again&s;t whatever artillery he &s;uppo&s;ed John would-bring into the field, in the in&s;tant that our luckle&s;s youth had brought his forces to the highe&s;t degree of order and perfection, &s;leep overtook him, and the day was lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN Fizorton's journey was not plea&s;ant. He rode with unu&s;ual ha&s;te, as if to leave behind him the reflection that &s;pur|red him on. But what human power can out&s;trip the velocity of thought? or e&s;cape the mind that gives it wing? Alas! he tra|velled with more than one arrow in his bo&s;om. "And wherefore," &s;aid he, "this &s;crutiny into Henry Fitzorton's my&s;teries? have I none of my own? and what if his &s;hould
<PB N="395" REF="405">proceed from an unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion? Is there no allowance to be made for involuntary feeling? and &s;hall not &s;ecret contention, and &s;acred re&s;erve in &s;uch an affliction, be accounted to him as virtue? yet into Henry's apology am I not in&s;inuating my own? Futile &s;ophi&s;try!"&mdash;</P>
<P>John broke from his &s;ubject; and, chang|ing the attack, levelled his artillery again&s;t one whom he mo&s;t dreaded to offend. This &s;elf-di&s;plea&s;ure was an anathema, fixing the immitigable cur&s;e. "For Henry," &s;aid he, "there are palliatives, for me, there can be none. Fool! ideot! hypocrite! and have I forgot my warning?"</P>
<P>Amid&s;t &s;uch rebuking thoughts, he rode on, till, midway betwixt Fitzorton ca&s;tle and the place of his de&s;tination, he came within view of a village &s;pire. He approached it in &s;ilence, and on arriving at a little inn near the church, he put up his hor&s;e. While he is there indulging meditation, we will relate, briefly, the hi&s;tory of his youth.</P>
<P>The elder brother derived from his &s;eni|ority only an earlier acquaintance with &s;orrow.
<PB N="396" REF="406">Not an ea&s;y or a vulgar prize, he yielded up his heart, in his &s;ixteenth year, to a lady, who, within a few weeks of the appointed nuptials, di&s;po&s;ed of her&s;elf to a more adu|lating and gaudy lover. In the fir&s;t effu&s;ion of re&s;entment, he predicted the de&s;tiny which afterwards befel her; and on her being di&s;|graced and abandoned, he paid her a vi&s;it &s;olely to expre&s;s his joy, that the aims of ambition and of fal&s;ehood had been di&s;ap|pointed. But while he was about to clothe this &s;entiment in language that might aggra|vate its import, news arrived that the pretended hu&s;band was dead, and that the imaginary widow had no lawful claim even to the name of the man who had en&s;nared her. John came to reprove; but the victim being already overwhelmed he departed, ob&s;erving, that the prophecy was fulfilled &s;omewhat &s;ooner than he expected!</P>
<P>Scarcely had he clo&s;ed the door ere his heart urged him to knock for re-admittance. In &s;hame, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair, Maria &s;unk on the floor the moment he re-entered. Unable to meet his eye, &s;he covered her
<PB N="397" REF="407">face with her hands, and withdrew to her chamber. He remained &s;ome time, con|tending with him&s;elf, and again left the hou&s;e. "She is in ruins," &s;aid John, "&s;he has &s;urvived my affections, and I blu&s;h at the &s;implicity that tru&s;ted them to her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; but &s;hall the &s;implicity of a child influence the conduct of a man? I will &s;ee her no more, becau&s;e I could not behold her without reproach. But &s;he has lived in affluence, and &s;hall not die in poverty.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding the&s;e reflections, he addre&s;&s;ed the following letter to Sir Armine Fitzorton.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FATHER AND FRIEND!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You would have indulged me, &s;ome years &s;ince, in a childi&s;h inclination: luckily it was not gratified. Treachery interpo&s;ed, and was, in that in&s;tance, the means of &s;aving me: the traitor has, therefore, to a certain extent, a claim upon my gratitude. But the traitor now is her&s;elf betrayed! &s;he is without a &s;ingle &s;hilling to continue the life, which, though it has lo&s;t all u&s;e and lu&s;tre, &s;hould
<PB N="398" REF="408">be pre&s;erved, till &s;he can have better hope in death. Of that fortune, therefore, which you generou&s;ly de&s;igned me, I will employ &s;uch a &s;um as may be nece&s;&s;ary to the decent purpo&s;es of a woman's life, for the &s;pace of one year; a year of experiment. The re&s;t I intreat may remain with my parental benefactor. I am honoured in &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The infidelity of Maria was connected with no common artifice. Village-bred, as was the maiden, &s;he might have taught le&s;&s;ons of coquetry to the mo&s;t practi&s;ed lady of the metropolis. Within one month of the appointed mock nuptials, &s;he urged her new lover to a &s;ecre&s;y, founded, &s;he &s;aid, on the fear of Mr. John Fitzorton, who tormented her with his addre&s;&s;es. Her lover was plea&s;ed at the propo&s;al of &s;ecre&s;y; for it favoured his own plan of deception. But &s;he was &s;ometimes embarra&s;&s;ed how to divide her&s;elf
<PB N="399" REF="409">between them. John, &s;he knew, was not a man to be tri&s;led with; nor her earl, for &s;uch he was, a man to trifle till his point was gained. Some objections mingled in the lady's family hi&s;tory; and &s;he would not have her&s;elf been the elected of John, had not a well-imitated &s;entiment of tender &s;orrow, terminating in as well-feigned a &s;ickne&s;s, found their way to his generous heart. Indeed, to imagine we have wounded, and to be told we can heal, are, in them&s;elves, deci&s;ive motives with a noble mind. He &s;o long believed him&s;elf beloved, that in the end, if he did not love, his affections were intere&s;ted to re&s;tore the happine&s;s which he &s;uppo&s;ed he had de&s;troyed, and he generou&s;ly re&s;olved to complete the felicity which he believed it was in his power to be&s;tow, by an immediate vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Maria re&s;ided with an aunt, who having arrived at the age of cards, and living in a card-loving pari&s;h, was a very proper aunt for a niece addicted to lovers. The good old lady happened to be at a party in the
<PB N="400" REF="410">neighbourhood, when John called at her hou&s;e to communicate the joyful news he had in &s;tore.</P>
<P>His rap at the door denoted that &s;ome|thing animated his heart. It could not be the rap of John,&mdash;thought the young lady&mdash; for two &s;turdy knocks, with a pau&s;e between, foretold the coming of that gentleman. It could not be the well-bred violence of a modi&s;h vi&s;itor; for no &s;uch were in the li&s;t of her acquaintance. It could not po&s;&s;ibly proceed from her aunt; for that good lady had not ordered Mrs. Betty and the gla&s;s lanthorn, and the warm night-cloak, till half pa&s;t nine, and the curfew had not yet tolled its appropriate hour. Neither could it be the noble lord; for, be&s;ides that he &s;eldom availed him&s;elf of his privilege when con|ducting an intrigue, he was at that very moment in <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> with Maria. Who&s;e knock then could it be? Mrs. Betty having &s;urveyed the announcer from a chamber win|dow, which had, for &s;ome time, been the ob&s;ervatory, ran down in a violent hurry,
<PB N="401" REF="411">and an&s;wered the que&s;tion by fir&s;t practi&s;ing the celebrated poetical &s;ignal:
<Q>Ju&s;t three &s;oft &s;trokes upon the <HI>parlour</HI> door,</Q>
and then let in John Fitzorton. John always frowned on denials, and laughed at apolo|gies; &s;o made his way directly into the parlour. Maria was alone, but in &s;trange di&s;order. This he imputed to the &s;ight of the man &s;he loved.&mdash;"I have often read about ro&s;y terrors, and my little brother Harry is much addicted to them. The boy is a &s;u&s;ceptible li&s;per, and I u&s;ed to &s;mile at him; but &s;ince my own heart has been a flutterer al&s;o, I only &s;mile when he is in his ro&s;y terrors, pat the lad on the cheek, or &s;troke his head. But," continued John, &s;eeing Maria's tremblings augment, "I now come with an a&s;&s;urance that the period de&s;|tined to make us ble&s;t, will ble&s;s my parents al&s;o." John expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a voice that be&s;poke the hone&s;t feeling of his heart, and pre&s;&s;ed Maria to a bo&s;om which might truly be called the man&s;ion of &s;incerity.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="412">While &s;he was yet in his embrace, a move|ment of feet, as if in fear to tread, and a &s;ound of voices, as if afraid of betraying a &s;ecret, were heard in the pa&s;&s;age. Pre|&s;ently a blundering again&s;t the door, was followed by an oath extorted by pain; "Damnation! I have broke my &s;hins!" exclaimed &s;ome one. Maria's terrors en|crea&s;ed. John, rather from &s;urpri&s;e than &s;u&s;picion, ran to the door.&mdash;"For heaven's &s;ake! dear John, do not attempt to&mdash;to"&mdash; and &s;he placed her back again&s;t the door, that the blunderers might have time to get off. While John li&s;tened, another voice yet louder than the former, roared out, "By G&mdash;d! unle&s;s we get a candle we may grope about this d&mdash;d entry all night, and &s;till not find the cur&s;ed key."&mdash;Nay, but there's mi&s;chief at work!" cried John.</P>
<P>He opened the door, all was in darkne&s;s; he took one of the parlour candles, and then &s;aw huddled into a corner two terror-&s;tricken beings; their faces folded in their coats. John caught hold of both, and declared he would immediately have them carried to his
<PB N="403" REF="413">father, Sir Armine, if they did not re&s;tore whatever they might have taken out of the hou&s;e. How conde&s;cending is guilt!&mdash;In&s;tead of replying to this &s;tern accu&s;ation, the gentle earl, who now unhooded, milkily &s;aid, "You are mi&s;taken, young gentleman. I have the honour to vi&s;it in this family." Maria had ventured to the parlour door. "The&s;e per&s;ons boa&s;t the honour of being on terms of intimacy here," &s;aid John, indignantly dragging his captives. "Good heaven!" exclaimed Maria, "Is it po&s;&s;ible <HI>you</HI> &s;hould be here, Mr. Durfey! I am afraid, in the confu&s;ion this pair of <HI>true lovyers</HI>"&mdash;point|ing to the &s;ervants&mdash;"were thrown into, by your pre&s;ence, that they were &s;uffering you to go away without &s;peaking to us. I am &s;ure my aunt would never forgive me if you were to leave us in that manner."</P>
<P>John did not interrupt their conver&s;ation, which, though a little disjointed, he looked upon as entirely doing away the charge of petty larceny, &s;o he let go his hold.</P>
<P>"This," re&s;umed Maria, "is the poor &s;ick gentleman who is down here for the
<PB N="404" REF="414">recovery of his health, and &s;ometimes drops in to pa&s;s an hour at picquet with my good aunt; and this is Mr. Thomas his valet, who is an humble &s;ervant, you mu&s;t know, of our Betty's." Mr. Thomas, unveiling, bowed affirmatively. Mrs. Betty declared with rap|ture &s;he had found the key. "How came it lo&s;t?" que&s;tioned John. While the inge|nious handmaid was looking about for an an&s;wer, Mr. Durfey very &s;moothly expre&s;&s;ed his &s;incere acknowledgments for the young lady's goodne&s;s; but he had merely called <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> &s;eeing the &s;ervants &s;weet-hearting at the door; and though he was labouring under a cough which would have made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;top for more than a few moments, he could not be guilty of even the appear|ance of neglect, where he had received &s;o many civilities. He begged his be&s;t com|pliments to the young lady's good aunt, and heartily wi&s;hed them a good night.</P>
<P>There was one circum&s;tance in this &s;tory, which very rarely happened to any of the nar|ratives of this right honourable hi&s;torian: one expre&s;&s;ion in it was <HI>true.</HI> He actually was
<PB N="405" REF="415">the influence of &s;o &s;evere a cough, that the imperious nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, while he remained where his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;uddenly con|veyed him, had almo&s;t &s;uffocated him; and after he had tried the different modes of &s;tifling this traitor to all family &s;ecrets, by holding in his breath, and cramming his cambrick handkerchief into his mouth, he was obliged to lift up the &s;a&s;h of the clo&s;et window, and take a lover's leap into the gar|den, making his way from thence into the kitchen, where he found Betty and his valet warmly engaged in another <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</HI> "Ble&s;s me! there's &s;omebody coming!" &s;aid the fair Abigail.&mdash;"Only my lord," replied the valet, with the familiarity which is &s;anctioned by a&s;&s;ociated vice,&mdash;advancing with ea&s;y bows as he &s;poke: "Mrs. Betty and your humble &s;ervant, my lord, having agreed to make a match of it, we were &s;ettling a few prelimina|ries." &mdash;"Hu&s;h! this is no time for &s;port: don't make any noife; &s;hew a light to the door &s;oftly."&mdash;The man and ma&s;ter &s;tole on tip|toe along the pa&s;&s;age, attended by the light|footed Mrs. Betty; but as the latter per|ceived
<PB N="406" REF="416">the key was not in the lock, &s;he &s;toop|ed down to &s;ee if it had not fallen, when the wind that i&s;&s;ued from under the door, blew out the light, and brought on the &s;everal events with which the reader has been made acquainted.</P>

<DIV2 N="50" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER L.</HEAD>
<P>"MARIA," &s;aid John, I dare &s;ay your aunt's motive for receiving that Mr. Durfey, is pity; your's, of cour&s;e, is obedience: but, take my word for it, he will &s;ome way abu&s;e the goodne&s;s of you both." "O no," replied Maria, "he's a poor &s;ick gentleman!"</P>
<P>"But why," que&s;tioned John, did he try to tuck him&s;elf out of &s;ight? a creeper into holes and corners is always a worthle&s;s fellow!"</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider his &s;tate of health, his nerves; he &s;eems in a deep decline; were it not for this idea I &s;hould never forgive him for inter|rupting the delightful tidings brought by my deare&s;t, deare&s;t John."</P>
<P>Maria contrived, in &s;omething le&s;s than &s;ixty moments, to make even her half-&s;u&s;pi|cious
<PB N="407" REF="417">lover forget every thing but what &s;he thought it convenient he &s;hould remember. She had now only to clear away the little roughne&s;&s;es which the adventure had left be|hind it. To effect this, &s;he called into action all her witchery, and lo! every contraction was taken from the brow of her lover. Never did Mrs. Betty her&s;elf with her be&s;t &s;mooth|ing iron bring her own apron or handker|chief, after romping with Mr. Thomas, more dexterou&s;ly out of its tell-tale rumples.</P>
<P>But this was <HI>not</HI> to be a very lucky hour either to the mi&s;tre&s;s or maid. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;weetly oblivious moments, while the hand of Maria was tenderly pre&s;&s;ing that of John; while her cheeks, and even her lips, invited and received the conciliatory ki&s;s, Mrs. Betty's well-known turn of the key, made it proper for the lovers to re&s;ume their &s;eats; in doing which, Maria was &s;o overcome with joy that it was nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he thought, to apply a handkerchief to her lovely, but unweeping eyes: and while &s;he held it up to her fair face, John perceived a letter which had been whi&s;ked out of her pocket, in a very
<PB N="408" REF="418">di&s;compo&s;ed &s;tate. As it lay on the floor, John was &s;truck by the words, "Fear not tall boy John, that great oaf &s;hall be beat hollow." The re&s;t of the &s;entence was lo&s;t in the folds.</P>
<P>John trembled as if he had been vi&s;ited by a pal&s;y in every joint. His teeth partly gna&s;hed, and partly chattered: he felt a tear in his eye, which burning rage &s;oon dried up; then he re&s;umed his &s;eat, and while the letter was in his hand, the good aunt came in. John attempted in vain to &s;peak; "Good heaven!" &s;aid the old lady, "what is the matter?" The changes in the countenance of the abi|gail were only le&s;s rueful than in tho&s;e of her young lady. The innocent aunt took out her &s;melling-bottle, ordered Betty to get a cordial from the corner cupboard, and &s;poke with &s;incere &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>John ro&s;e, and &s;eemed a&s;hamed to have been wrought on. "I fancy, madam, I have the cue of my di&s;order, here is my hand: your niece dropt this letter in the &s;tate you now &s;ee it, and I perceived my own name mo&s;t villainou&s;ly coupled with words that
<PB N="409" REF="419">demand in&s;tant explanation; but, as the letter is not my property, I can only throw it within reach of the woman to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed, thus!&mdash;If &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed to do her&s;elf, her corre&s;pondent, and the man to whom &s;he is contracted, ju&s;tice, &s;he will account for all this."</P>
<P>John again &s;at down.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t have mi&s;taken names," &s;aid the aunt: "yours could never be joined to any di&s;re&s;pectful words. Child, read the letter directly, and there will be an end of it."</P>
<P>"There will &s;o," &s;aid John.</P>
<P>"Only my cou&s;in Charlotte, who is always &s;aying &s;ome fooli&s;h non&s;en&s;e or other for &s;port again&s;t Mr. Fitzorton, to vex me: you know her way, aunt."</P>
<P>"Then your niece, madam, can have no difficulty in reading it," &s;aid John.</P>
<P>"But that I cannot do, you ill-tempered creature! Charlotte would never forgive me if &s;he thought I &s;hewed her letters; be&s;ides you ought to know, I had rather die, than hear a &s;yllable again&s;t you &s;eriou&s;ly."</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="420">Here &s;he &s;elt again for her handker|chief, and probably found it, but fearing, perhaps, another accident, did not draw it forth.</P>
<P>"I require only to look at the direction of that letter," exclaimed John.</P>
<P>"Hold up the letter and let Mr. Fitzorton &s;ee the &s;uper&s;cription in&s;tantly, niece."</P>
<P>"There then, you cro&s;s thing!" holding it at arm's-length, and affecting to pout.</P>
<P>"Nearer," &s;aid John; "in your hand it is in perpetual motion; confide it to mine."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, let Mr. Fitzorton have it," &s;aid the aunt; "you have been at girl and boy's play long enough."</P>
<P>Maria &s;hook with apprehen&s;ion, and as a la&s;t effort to prevent the dreaded di&s;covery, &s;he made a feint as if to &s;nuff the candles that John might &s;ee better, when di&s;gui&s;ing her terror in a trick, to which &s;he gave the air of a frolick, &s;he extingui&s;hed one light, and blew out another; and then bur&s;ting into a well-imitated laugh, hurried towards the door, and would, doubtle&s;s, have taken
<PB N="411" REF="421">good care of the letter, had not John arre&s;ted her progre&s;s.&mdash;"Nay then, in&s;tead of girl's play, I perceive your niece, madam, has been, and &s;till is, very hard at work. I mu&s;t now in&s;i&s;t on having the matter in&s;tantly cleared up."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on it too," rejoined the good aunt. She went blindfold to the bell, and rang it violently.</P>
<P>The young lady now at her la&s;t &s;take, fir&s;t &s;queezing the letter into a twi&s;t, began to thru&s;t it between her ruby lips, and would have incontinently torn it to pieces with her ivory teeth, had not John wrenched it from her, &s;wearing "that were the author before him, attempting, as Maria had attempted, to elude his in&s;pection, he would pur&s;ue its contents to the centre of his heart."</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of the parties the con&s;cious Mrs. Betty entered. It was a de&s;perate moment. Maria, coming up clo&s;e to John, whi&s;pered him to beware&mdash;he might repent it&mdash;&s;he would advi&s;e him not to proceed too far&mdash;he did not perhaps know of what &s;he was capable.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="422">Di&s;daining reply, John &s;ecured the key of the parlour door, and ordering the terrified abigail to light the candles, he took one of tho&s;e "flaming in&s;truments" to the poor aunt, and with a voice and manner that, in every tone and movement, &s;eparated the innocent from the criminals, ob&s;erved, "that although he felt him&s;elf warranted, con&s;ider|ing the predicament in which he &s;tood, to read a letter wherein the writer had dared to in&s;ult him, he had &s;uch faith in what he had heard and &s;een of <HI>her</HI> integrity, that if &s;he a&s;&s;ured him it was written by a woman, he would require a far le&s;s important &s;acrifice than he &s;hould otherwi&s;e exact."</P>
<P>Maria now &s;at her&s;elf down in a kind of &s;orrowful de&s;peration. Yet &s;he conceived a gleam of hope, and but a gleam, that her aunt would make a little free with her u&s;ual probity, to &s;ave a niece who&s;e fame and fortune &s;he might thereby clear up or ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid the aged lady, "though it would be with poignant mi&s;ery I &s;hould find my niece capable of what you have
<PB N="413" REF="423">laid to her charge, depend on my vera|city!"</P>
<P>All hopes were over with Maria, &s;o the faithful Betty walked off. The aunt put on her &s;pectacles, and rubbed them with the corner of her handkerchief that &s;he might &s;ee the clearer. John held the candle. She opened the fatal &s;croll, from which, on an impul&s;e of honour, John turned away his head.&mdash;A pau&s;e!&mdash;The paper &s;oon began to tremble in the aunt's hand. John darted a look at Maria. "Plea&s;e, madam, to make report."&mdash;A &s;econd and yet longer pau&s;e.&mdash;The good old lady exhibited every mark of con&s;ternation; her tears dropped on her &s;pectacles.&mdash;"Alas! alas! there was left only this girl's &s;uppo&s;ed truth and good|ne&s;s to &s;u&s;tain me, &s;ir; the hope and con|fidence of many years is overturned in a moment; yet, to bring her to this, &s;urely, &s;urely &s;ome heinous arts mu&s;t have been prac|ti&s;ed again&s;t my niece, by this Mr. Durfey."</P>
<P>"Durfey!" ejaculated John:&mdash;"Yes, &s;ir, Mr. Durfey, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed a poor, inof|fen&s;ive, &s;ick gentleman."</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="424">"Madam," interpo&s;ed John, "I relea&s;e you from the trouble of any further peru&s;al; and I grieve that a nece&s;&s;ary explanation has cau&s;ed you pain. The ju&s;tice of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing my&s;elf of that letter you will not refu&s;e me, &s;ince the honour of both our families is in|volved in it."</P>
<P>She &s;uffered him to draw the letter out of her hand, and, bowing re&s;pectfully to <HI>her,</HI> he left the hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LI.</HEAD>
<P>AT the date of the&s;e events, John was on a vi&s;it to Mr. Clare, who then re&s;ided, part of the year, at a &s;eat about three miles from Maria's village.</P>
<P>He walked to his friend's hou&s;e &s;o in|ten&s;ely thinking on what had pa&s;t, that the &s;pace was in a manner annihilated. On his arrival he re&s;i&s;ted all entreaty, and avoided all explanation, though his di&s;ordered ap|pearance excited inquiry. The in&s;tant he
<PB N="415" REF="425">reached his chamber, he opened Durfey's letter, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare&s;t as lovelie&s;t!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>All things are nearly arranged. Apartments &s;ecured for us in town. My chaplain will meet to ble&s;s us on the way. Fear not Tall-boy John; that great oaf &s;hall be beat hollow. Such a trea&s;ure as Maria is not fit to be tru&s;ted to his keep|ing. Family affairs make it prudent to keep our nuptials, titles, &amp;c. for a &s;ea&s;on concealed. What has grandeur to do with happine&s;s?

<CLOSER><SIGNED>The doating, devoted, DURFEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To attempt any de&s;cription of the &s;tate into which John was thrown by this letter would be pre&s;umption. The emotion, which,
<PB N="416" REF="426">by its magnitude, &s;u&s;pended every power of &s;peech, is too mighty for written language. Not words only, but the capacity of action was, for &s;ome time, &s;o entirely taken away, that he &s;at fixed in his chair, pale, motionle&s;s, and cold; as if &s;ome new and peculiar fate had hardened his body into a petrefaction; and when the power of changing po&s;ture, in any degree, returned, he caught at the bell, but wanting force to ring, he &s;unk on the bed, where he remained &s;ome hours, weaker than infancy or age.</P>
<P>He recovered, only to find him&s;elf the make-game of an intriguing girl, the ridicule of an unprincipled impo&s;tor, and, on all hands, circumvented in his generous de&s;igns, in re|turn for an unpracti&s;ed and un&s;ullied heart, that had &s;oftened to pity, ere it glowed with love. He meditated terrible puni&s;hments. They went not to the honourable death, but extended to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the impo&s;tor. "His blood," &s;aid John, " &s;hall an&s;wer it! openly, and in the face of day, will I ma&s;&s;a|cre him. It will be a deed of philanthropy,
<PB N="417" REF="427">and of public good to put an end to his crimes.&mdash;Yet&mdash;&s;hall the &s;on of Armine Fitz|orton turn common &s;tabber? No. I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the cu&s;tom of the times, and give to a rogue the chance of killing an hone&s;t man."</P>
<P>All his &s;en&s;ations pointed to Durfey; not a thought deviated to his a&s;&s;ociate. Maria was not more defended from his vengeance by her &s;ex, than by the contempt which had &s;unk her in his e&s;teem. She now wanted importance in his mind, to entitle her to the dignity of his anger:&mdash;&s;he had fallen from the eminence of his highe&s;t confidence to the profounde&s;t in&s;ignificance. But the audacity of a man, who had dared to mingle the name of Fitzorton with the ribald &s;allies of a gal|lant, was an object of correction, and he ro&s;e before the &s;un to cha&s;ti&s;e him. But the hurry of his &s;pirits, and of his reflections, &s;till in|tercepted his purpo&s;e. In rai&s;ing him&s;elf from the bed, and in getting down &s;tairs, his &s;trength was nearly exhau&s;ted; and while he was attempting to remove the fa&s;tnings of
<PB N="418" REF="428">the outward door, every corporeal power again for&s;ook him, and he dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the thre&s;hold. Such was the condition in which he was, at length, found by the &s;ervants, whom he had alarmed, and who conveyed him back to his chamber. This debility was followed by an acce&s;&s;ion of fever &s;o inten&s;e, that life became at hazard. In a &s;hort inter|val, however, that the di&s;order afforded, he thus wrote to Durfey.</P>
<P>"Villain!&mdash;This appellation explains it|&s;elf, when you learn that I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your infamous letter to Maria. I will be prepared to receive you here any time before the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent day, to &s;ettle with you for the liberties you have taken with JOHN FITZORTON."</P>
<P>The writer's malady was not abated by having penned this letter; yet the thought of having written it, and of having found a tru&s;ty dome&s;tic, no le&s;s than True George, then a boy, but a boy of honour, &s;eemed to give him &s;pirits. His friends looked upon
<PB N="419" REF="429">the&s;e as omens of returning health. His doctor imputed them to the operation of well-prepared medicines; John to the real cau&s;e, the hope of exterminating from &s;o|ciety one of its mon&s;ters. He gave out that he expected to &s;ee a per&s;on, with whom he had the greate&s;t wi&s;h in the world to con|ver&s;e; and he forced a &s;mile, which led Mr. and Mrs. Clare to &s;uppo&s;e he had planned a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with his Maria, more e&s;pecially when it was found that little George had taken the road to the village where the young lady re&s;ided.</P>
<P>"As that is the ca&s;e, friend John," &s;aid the good Mr. Clare, adopting the idea, "you will want all your force to &s;ay pretty things to the dam&s;el of your affections, and mu&s;t be kept quiet until &s;he comes." John believing it might facilitate his de&s;ign, did not di&s;|courage this notion; and Mr. Clare gave orders to admit into Mr. Fitzorton's room, whoever might require conver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P>John remenbered to have &s;een a pair of pi&s;tols hang in the adjoining room. The&s;e
<PB N="420" REF="430">he conveyed into his apartment, unperceived, and placed them behind his pillow; then made &s;ome &s;light alterations in his dre&s;s, and waited the arrival of the counterfeit Durfey with extreme &s;olicitude. The hour of his fever returned; yet he now thought him&s;elf better; mi&s;taking the fire raging in his veins for the genial exhilaration of renovating health. At length, a rap was given at his chamber-door, and he &s;prang to open it, a&s;&s;ured of &s;eeing little George and Maria's paramour. The former, always faithful, ap|peared to his wi&s;h; but the latter, profiting by Maria's information of what had pa&s;&s;ed at her aunt's, after he had made his well-bred bow, had taken him&s;elf off at the dead of the night following, in company with his "charming nur&s;e," who had conde&s;cended, like him&s;elf, to re&s;ign all bridal pomps for the comfortable ob&s;curity of a &s;ecure elopement. She was attended only by the ductile Betty, who, in the &s;ame hour, at the &s;ame place, became, by virtue of ties almo&s;t as &s;acred, the e&s;pou&s;ed of Mr. Thomas, who had given away his hand yet oftener than his lord.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LII.</HEAD>
<P>To this early piece of treachery, we are to attribute &s;ome of tho&s;e rigorous judgments and &s;u&s;picions which gave force to the natural acumen of &s;ome parts of John Fitzorton's di&s;po&s;ition; and, indeed, it was treachery of the wor&s;t kind, and falling out at the wor&s;t period of life. The mere di&s;|appointment pa&s;&s;ed away; nay, he &s;oon look|ed on it as an e&s;cape from the temerity of boyi&s;h pur&s;uits; and it had the effect of leading his thoughts to profound and manly contemplations, to the &s;oul-expanding &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on, of nature and of God. The heavy &s;en&s;e of the deception, however, entered his bo&s;om, and engraved there an image of perfidy that had taken the form of beauty and love: a fiend in the angel &s;emblance of Maria. "But out of evil there cometh good," cried John&mdash;"I am armed for ever again&s;t woman!"</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="432">There would, indeed, have been &s;ome danger that a mind like his, working under &s;uch an influence, might have brooded over its &s;u&s;picions until they grew into mi&s;an|thropy. But the example of a benevolent family continually before his eyes, whenever he vi&s;ited Fitzorton ca&s;tle, kept alive the principles of human kindne&s;s in his heart; and &s;erved as a counterpoi&s;e to the un&s;ocial check it had thus received in early life; even as the flower who&s;e bud the chilling breath of one inau&s;picious morn had begun to nip, is recovered by the &s;un: another ungenial gale might have blighted it for ever; but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vivifying beams re&s;tores it; and though it may long &s;hew the injury which it received in the &s;ea&s;on of the tender leaf, it &s;hall &s;till be numbered among&s;t the proude&s;t blooms of the garden. Not|with&s;tanding this, John felt it nece&s;&s;ary &s;oon after to add the active to contemplative em|ployments; and on a mixed principle of policy and pa&s;&s;ion he became a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>And now, reader, we are ha&s;tening to the
<PB N="423" REF="433">point from which we &s;et out. The juvenile hi&s;tory of John is drawing to a clo&s;e. We have &s;een his young heart, under the influ|ences of pity and gratitude, and of a love grafted only upon the&s;e. We have ob&s;erved him under the emotions of re&s;entment, rage, and de&s;pair. The &s;upplementary parts are few, but potent.</P>
<P>Maria's aunt fell a martyr to grief &s;oon after the&s;e tran&s;actions; and Maria her&s;elf &s;urvived her deceiver but eighteen months, during which &s;he remained the object of John's bounty, &s;olely for the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned in his letter; nor did &s;he know the &s;ource, even in her expiring moments.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e moments, however, &s;he earne&s;tly &s;upplicated an interview with John. Whe|ther he would have re&s;i&s;ted the appeal, had it reached him in time, cannot be known, for the petitioner died the evening of the day on which the reque&s;t was made.</P>
<P>"It is too late," &s;aid the per&s;on who brought the news; "the &s;oul of Maria is now &s;oliciting the pardon of its maker!"</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="434">"May he grant it!" &s;ighed John.&mdash;"Is &s;he in her grave?" added he. On being told that &s;he would not be buried until the night following, he ob&s;erved, "that his vow renounced the &s;ight of her, only while liv|ing;" he then ordered his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Maria's remains had been removed out of the hear&s;e into the hou&s;e of her late aunt, when John reached the memorable vil|lage.</P>
<P>It was among&s;t the wi&s;hes of the decea&s;ed, that her body might be &s;uffered to remain awhile in the apartment where &s;he had won, and lo&s;t, the heart of John Fitzorton. And this indulgence was, by the intere&s;t of the per&s;on whom John had employed, and who brought the tidings of her decea&s;e, procured of the tenant who then occupied it. And thus he found him&s;elf once more with Maria, in the very room where &s;he had gained his affection, and incurr'd its forfeit.</P>
<P>"Is the coffin &s;oldered?" demanded John. Before any one could reply, he had felt the lid, and found it fa&s;t. "Better as it is, per|haps,
<PB N="425" REF="435">added he.&mdash;"Sir," &s;aid the principal attendant of the hear&s;e, "if it is your plea|&s;ure it can ea&s;ily be opened.&mdash;Indeed, I had before my doubts, whether all is quite as it &s;hould be within; &s;o I have only tacked down the head-piece."</P>
<P>John making no reply, and his anxious looks being taken for a&s;&s;ent, the lid was lifted up, and the dead Maria pre&s;ented to his view. The hear&s;e-driver a&s;ked, whether that which the lady had got in her right hand ought to go into the ground with her?&mdash;"To my thoughts, Sir," continued the man, "it is too good to be thrown into the earth; but it &s;eems his honour, your father, would have it &s;o, becau&s;e the lady, when dying, de|&s;ired it:&mdash;but dying people have &s;trange fancies."</P>
<P>John, looking into the coffin, perceived within the gra&s;p of Maria's clay-cold hand, a miniature of him&s;elf, given to her in the day of his confidence. But while he was yet &s;urveying the miniature, another object a&s;|&s;ailed his attention: a female, who&s;e face
<PB N="426" REF="436">was covered with a veil, and who appeared to be the chief mourner, now unfolded a &s;able covering that wrapped up an infant, which, being lifted to the height of the coffin was bade, by the per&s;on holding it, to take, &s;ince the coffin was again unclo&s;ed, another look of her poor mother. John &s;tarted. The uncon&s;cious babe put in its little arms, and began to play with the flow|ers that were &s;trewed over the corp&s;e.&mdash;"Who&s;e is this?" que&s;tioned John.&mdash;"Ma|ria's," an&s;wered a trembling voice.&mdash;"And that villain Durfey's?" &s;aid John.&mdash;"Alas, yes, &s;ir!" replied the female.&mdash;"No mat|ter," &s;aid John, taking it gently in his arms: "It has a likene&s;s of the mother,&mdash;&s;uch as once I &s;aw her&mdash;And is this the only fruit of&mdash;" "It is, your honour."&mdash;"Poor little wretch!" &s;aid John, returning it to the woman, whom he found to be the very &s;ervant who had been &s;o active in the plot again&s;t him; but was no &s;ooner recog|nized than &s;he dropped her double-folded veil, and &s;hrunk from the humid eyes of John.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="437">The hear&s;e-driver put his hand into the coffin, and would have taken out the minia|ture from the dead hand.&mdash;"Let it alone, fel|low!" &s;aid John, &s;ternly. Then looking in Maria's face, "Thou ha&s;t not de&s;erved it," &s;aid he, "but 'twas a gift; and the dead &s;hall not be plundered."</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;oldering being done in his pre&s;ence; and had his eye on the coffin until it was depo&s;ited in the grave. As he moved &s;lowly from the reliques he &s;aid, "Alas! after all, misfortune is not the le&s;s to be pitied, when re&s;ulting from vices by which the offender is robbed of every energy, human and divine, to bear it with fortitude. Ill-fated Maria! I pity thee."</P>
<P>From this aera, whenever John felt his ideas opening to the po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;econd attachment, again&s;t which the deception he met with in the fir&s;t had, in a manner, ca&s;ed his heart in armour, he would recal to his memory the danger he had e&s;caped; and in order to bring that deception more imme|diately under his eye, he would betake him|&s;elf
<PB N="428" REF="438">to the burial-place of the fir&s;t faithle&s;s object of his confidence.&mdash;Even from the tomb of the trait're&s;s &s;eemed to proceed the coun&s;els of a friend. Amid&s;t the &s;tillne&s;s of night and the &s;hadows of the moon, he would gaze on the gra&s;&s;y hillock that covered the remains of Maria, till a voice&mdash;a warning voice,&mdash;appeared to ri&s;e from the ground, conjuring him to beware.</P>
<P>And this warning was more than u&s;ually nece&s;&s;ary at the time he &s;topped at the gate of the church-yard, where we recently left him. "True," &s;aid he, advancing to the grave, "I live not in re&s;entment of the dead, but &s;omething &s;tronger than my own rea&s;on, or experience, admoni&s;hes me to &s;tand, once more, guarded again&s;t the liv|ing! &mdash;O, had ever fal&s;ehood, predetermined fal&s;ehood, a form more beautiful, a voice more &s;weet than thine, Maria? I tru&s;ted thee! wert thou not my faith, my hope, my conviction?&mdash;Could malice, envy, hatred,&mdash; could ought but thy&s;elf have de&s;troyed thy|&s;elf? &mdash;Yet even in the moment that I
<PB N="429" REF="439">thought thy faith mo&s;t entire, was it not mo&s;t broken? Continue then to harden my heart! and peace to thy &s;hade! But, alas!" continued he, after a pau&s;e of &s;everal minutes, "what defence can the memory of a thou&s;and fal&s;e and wicked beings, afford again&s;t the virtues of one innocent woman? and that I have found one good being, even of womankind, it would be willful blindne&s;s again&s;t the light of heaven to deny. Shall he who con&s;tantly &s;ees and feels the &s;un's ble&s;&s;ed beams, di&s;pute his power? &s;hall he he&s;itate to confe&s;s it is a &s;park from God, becau&s;e he has been once mi&s;led by a &s;hining vapour of the air, or an exhalation of the earth?&mdash;Adieu, Maria!&mdash;thy grave can no longer avail! farewell to it for ever!&mdash;Yes, unle&s;s thou can&s;t teach me to forget worth, and beauty, and fraternal love, and filial ho|nour, &mdash;all that is due to my&s;elf, my family, and my god,&mdash;farewell to the &s;pot that en|clo&s;es thy du&s;t! But if thou can&s;t teach me to remember all the&s;e, yet &s;ubdue the rebel powers that agonize my &s;oul with vain wi&s;hes, that the affections of the lovely being
<PB N="430" REF="440">who winds round my heart, had fallen to the lot of John, in&s;tead of Henry Fitzorton;&mdash; then will I con&s;ider this thy place of burial, as the &s;pot mo&s;t holy, mo&s;t beneficent,&mdash;then will I repair to it with more than pilgrim veneration, and it &s;hall be my &s;anctuary."</P>
<P>In a word, John found out a truth im|portant to the heart&mdash;th&aacute;t the affection pro|duced only by gratitude, or pity, is not love.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="53" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER LIII.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE any tender &s;entiment had been &s;trongly excited by Henry in the brea&s;t of Olivia Clare, John had witne&s;&s;ed her attrac|tive powers. He &s;aw that no being within her reach could &s;uffer without calling forth her compa&s;&s;ion, which, during his own &s;ick|ne&s;s and &s;orrows, while at her father's hou&s;e, was di&s;played in &s;o many artle&s;s ways, that while her own per&s;on was yet the care of a nur&s;ery, &s;he was able her&s;elf to nur&s;e the wounded mind.</P>
<P>She would &s;ometimes &s;teal into. John's chamber, during his illne&s;s, and try all her
<PB N="431" REF="441">powers of con&s;olation. Then knowing little of the plea&s;ures, and le&s;s of the pains of love, &s;he had heard they made the heart more happy, or more mi&s;erable, than any other joy or grief in the world; and &s;he had col|lected enough from the family below, to under&s;tand that the poor youth above, &s;uf|fered from the fal&s;ehood of one he had loved. Hence, whenever the little Olivia detected, in &s;pite of his efforts, a tear gu&s;h from his eye, &s;he would a&s;cend his knee, to wipe, or to ki&s;s it away. John often noticed this, when he overlooked every thing el&s;e. It was little le&s;s than a cherub's pity, and came in a moment, when whatever had been long enough in the world to have been polluted by its practices, would have rendered it &s;u&s;|pected. &mdash;"Yes," would he frequently, and &s;ighingly &s;ay, while Olivia attempted to &s;oothe him,&mdash;"yes, &s;weet girl, at pre&s;ent it is nature. Ah, how do I lament the impo&s;|&s;ibility of thy remaining thus genuine!" Gazing earne&s;tly, he proceeded,&mdash;"Once that very being who has thus ba&s;ely deceived
<PB N="432" REF="442">me, was &s;uch as thou art. O, if thou art to grow up, like her, into frauds, and to array thy&s;elf in fa&s;cinations, manifold and mighty enough to cover the wor&s;t deceit; 'twere better, far better, for thy&s;elf, thy parents, all whom thou art to en&s;nare, and for thy own &s;oul, that thou wert taken to heaven, while thy purity may render thee acceptable."</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions he would care&s;s her on his lap, or fold her in his arms, and, as he rai&s;ed her to his lips, would ex|claim, with an emotion, and empha&s;is that &s;tartled her, "Surely it is not decreed for thee to be another traitor!&mdash;another Ma|ria!" &mdash;The child a&s;&s;ured him &s;he &s;hould always be a very good girl, and very truly love tho&s;e who loved her.</P>
<P>At the end of John's &s;ickne&s;s, which was not until the end of his long vi&s;it, he &s;aw little more of Olivia for &s;ome time, except when he repaired to the grave of Maria, or when the Clare family were down at the manor-hou&s;e, in the pari&s;h of Fitzorton; yet, even in the&s;e ca&s;ual glances, the unfold|ing
<PB N="433" REF="443">graces of her mind and per&s;on, &s;erved as antidotes to the poi&s;on which the conduct of Maria had infu&s;ed into his heart.</P>
<P>But on the Clares' coming after the death of Olivia's mother to re&s;ide in London, John had yet more opportunity to &s;ee the beauty of Olivia's form and heart yet in their bud, and more keenly to deplore what, he &s;uppo&s;ed, mu&s;t happen to the blo&s;&s;om.</P>
<P>He would vigilantly watch every action, as if he expected to di&s;cover &s;ome female artifice beginning to &s;pring. The innocent creature &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e an idea of this kind was working in his mind; for one day after John had been examining her looks, then employed on &s;omething that appeared much to intere&s;t her, &s;he exclaimed,&mdash;"You may look! but I mean ju&s;t what I &s;ay, Mr. John, and am a very good little girl &s;till, I a&s;&s;ure you; am I not, papa? &s;o pray don't fix your eyes on me &s;o; for though I mean, as I told you at Clare-place, to be a good girl as long as I live, you make me afraid of you, Mr. John!"</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="444">This was, indeed, the truth; perhaps, for John, a fatal truth: &s;ince it is certain there grew up in this lovely girl's mind towards him a certain awe, which, though it aro&s;e from a veneration for his virtues, and a gra|titude for his guardian care, was the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;entiment for his latent affec|tion, that he could po&s;&s;ibly in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Hence, although John had exactly the opportunities with Olivia in London, of the very twelve months which Henry had partaken with Caroline in the country; and though, with re&s;pect to the&s;e two brothers, both then received the indelible impre&s;&s;ions of love;&mdash; that love, &s;o often at cro&s;s purpo&s;es, con|trived to re&s;erve for Henry the heart, which, coming into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by that important year too late, was de&s;tined to render the one inexpre&s;&s;ibly mi&s;erable, and would have made the other exqui&s;itely happy.</P>
<P>Not that the latter then con&s;idered Olivia at an age to be the proper object of a de|claration, had &s;he &s;ufficiently obliviated his former di&s;appointment, which was by no
<PB N="435" REF="445">means the ca&s;e; but he experienced a &s;enti|ment &s;o extremely anxious, about her future &s;incerity, and felt &s;o unea&s;y at the per&s;ua&s;ion that her pre&s;ent integrity could not la&s;t, that a man who &s;ecretly knew of a hidden trea|&s;ure, and had an almo&s;t con&s;tant foreboding that it would &s;ooner or later be explored and taken from him, or, by &s;ome &s;trange power, turn to dro&s;s, could not be more di&s;quieted in the intermediate time.</P>
<P>This led Olivia now and then to complain to her father, that &s;he feared &s;he had, un|knowingly, &s;aid, or done, &s;omething to offend Mr. John Fitzorton, which, &s;he de|clared, &s;he would not do for the world, as &s;he believed him to be a very good, though a terrifying young gentleman.&mdash;"Two things," &s;aid &s;he, once in a whi&s;per to Henry, "have always a&s;toni&s;hed me; fir&s;t, how any young woman &s;hould dare to love John Fitzorton: or, how, having &s;o dared, &s;he &s;hould dare to be fal&s;e to him!&mdash;For my part, had I been ever &s;o much inclined to be bad, I &s;hould have been ab&s;olutely afraid."</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="446">It was about the time Mr. Clare quitted the metropolis to re&s;ide con&s;tantly at the manor-hou&s;e, that John entered into the mi|litary profe&s;&s;ion, in the hope, as we have &s;een, of deriving con&s;olation from more active &s;cenes.</P>
<P>On parting with Olivia he de&s;ired her "to remember her promi&s;e of being a good little girl;" ob&s;erving, "that if favourable report &s;hould be made of her on his return, he would be her knight-errant, and &s;hould &s;he ever be in di&s;tre&s;s or danger, her quarrel &s;hould be his; and he would lay the caitiff, who &s;hould wrong her, dead at her feet. But that, if &s;he turned out a 'whitened &s;epulchre,' a golden idol, a demon ma&s;qued, he would, in pity to her father, and in ju&s;tice to mankind, move her to the darke&s;t tower of &s;ome ca&s;tle he &s;hould take in war, and there keep her from the &s;ight of injured friends and betrayed lovers, for the re&s;t of her life!&mdash;u&s;ing the very arms which &s;hould fight her cau&s;e while it was ju&s;t, again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to attempt her re&s;cue!
<PB N="437" REF="447">On this I pledge my faith: &s;o have a care, Olivia, honour or &s;hame!"&mdash;Hereupon, John took her trembling hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, kneeling down at the &s;ame time, with chivalric homage, to confirm the treaty. He &s;poke between je&s;t and earne&s;t; but there was &s;omething in the air and form of words that quickened the motion of her heart, and made it palpitate with apprehen|&s;ion. "Is it a compact?" &s;aid John, ri&s;ing &s;olemnly. "It is," an&s;wered Olivia; "but on my life, you are a very proper &s;oldier; for &s;o formidable a friend, mu&s;t needs be a mo&s;t terrible enemy! However," added &s;he, "I believe you would neither be friend or foe, but on ju&s;t grounds; &s;o the god of armies be your guard, and return you to us a conqueror!" Alas, the victory was hers; and John Fitzorton was wounded, and a captive, before he entered the field."</P>
<P>Yet, whatever were his duties, or however he multiplied them, they were performed. Neither the &s;oftne&s;s, nor the di&s;appointment, of his heart dimini&s;hed its natural energy.
<PB N="438" REF="448">Had love returned, animated his arm, and Olivia been the expected reward, he could not have deported him&s;elf with more manly ardour.</P>
<P>Henry meantime,&mdash;&s;o involved in mazes is the heart,&mdash;di&s;played to Olivia the very mind and adornments, that by a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of John, perhaps more powerfully attracted her than they might have done, if they had been &s;eparately viewed: but thus forced into a contra&s;t between the two bro|thers, the awe in which &s;he had always held the one, found even a relief in the &s;oftne&s;s with which &s;he contemplated the inviting addre&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after the young warrior's return from his fir&s;t campaign, to Fitzorton ca&s;tle, he perceived, that whatever victories he had obtained abroad, he could &s;till hope for none at home. He found Henry in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the citadel. Olivia her&s;elf acknowledged her commander; and the &s;acred lips of his parents ratified the avowal. There was an end of enquiry, and of hope. From that
<PB N="439" REF="449">moment he looked on his own partiality as a rebel in his brea&s;t; and invariably u&s;ed every mode he could devi&s;e to pro&s;per their pa&s;|&s;ion, and &s;ubdue his own. He lived in eter|nal warfare with his generous heart; taxed it mo&s;t &s;everely; inflicted on it a weight of reproof it could never de&s;erve; and when military duty did not &s;ummon, he broke from the ca&s;tle, leaving all he loved, and all he honoured, the moment he felt his heart too tender to bear&mdash;what, indeed, is the mo&s;t in|&s;upportable thing in the world, to a man who has any heart at all,&mdash;the perpetual conver&s;ation of the family, about the di&s;|po&s;al of the only woman he ever truly loved; nay, frequently to hear from the enraptured lips, or &s;ee in the flu&s;hing cheeks, of that very woman, every &s;entiment and &s;en&s;ation, which, in a le&s;s elevated and di&s;ciplined character, would inflame jealou&s;y, and put in motion every act of vengeance or &s;up|plantation. John, alas! only drooped and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day, however, of his return
<PB N="440" REF="450">from the field, he took occa&s;ion to a&s;k Olivia, in the pre&s;ence of both the families, a&s;&s;em|bled to greet him, whether, before he laid down his arms he was to cover her with his laurels, or convey her to the dark tower? Had &s;he kept, or had &s;he violated her word? was &s;he &s;till the honoured, or the degraded Olivia?</P>
<P>Olivia blu&s;hed and trembled; "I &s;ee," continued John, "the bud has unfolded into more decided blooms. Its colours, have gained &s;trength without lo&s;ing &s;oftne&s;s; but are there not &s;ome flowers that &s;hrink from a too near approach; and others that ad|vance to meet it with congenial warmth? I am no poet, Henry, and know not, there|fore, how to manage this image. Prith'ee, fini&s;h it for me."</P>
<P>"I will take upon me," &s;aid James, the moderator, "to an&s;wer that que&s;tion. When|ever John Fitzorton &s;talks with a giant's force towards this amiable girl of ours, whom we are all in love with, &s;he is the &s;en&s;itive plant, and trembles, over-awed, at his powers;
<PB N="441" REF="451">but when, laying a&s;ide his terrours, he makes her the object of his guardian enquiries, or confers on her mind, or per&s;on, tho&s;e prai&s;es which, it is known, he never lavi&s;hes on the unde&s;erving, the warmth of her gratified heart, like the &s;unflower, &s;prings to meet him, and &s;ends a glow into her cheek that &s;hews &s;he is enamoured of &s;uch prai&s;es, and is proud to have de&s;erved them."</P>
<P>"Hey day!" exclaimed the hero, rally|ing, "I am afraid our balancer has lo&s;t his equilibrium. Runs the tide even &s;till, James," added John, laying his hand on his brother's heart.</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t," cried Olivia, after &s;ome confu&s;ion, "I know not what to &s;ay to any of you. If I am &s;till not at lea&s;t the vaine&s;t of women, I am certainly not without &s;ome claims; for every one of you has &s;aid enough to &s;poil me, and as to our warrior brother&mdash; if trembling, and blu&s;hing, receding, and advancing, be proofs of merit, whenever I am in his pre&s;ence, I certainly mu&s;t be one of the mo&s;t de&s;erving girls in the world. I
<PB N="442" REF="452">do certainly, always did, and believe ever &s;hall tremble, like an a&s;pin, whenever Mr. John Fitzorton &s;peaks to me, and I cannot po&s;&s;ibly help it. But if, before he has done &s;peaking, I perceive, or feel, that any part of my conduct could be reported to his &s;atis|faction, if I then blu&s;h, it is with plea&s;ure, to think my&s;elf &s;till worthy the notice of &s;o ine&s;timable a friend."</P>
<P>The hero was di&s;armed; he pau&s;ed; felt his own cheek burn, and his own heart tremble.</P>
<P>"No dark tower, &s;on John," &s;aid lady Fitzorton, "but &s;ome gorgeous palace fit for one who is the boa&s;t of both our hou&s;es, and likely to be the glory of our po&s;|terity!"</P>
<P>A certain con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;itua|tion, and the reliance he had on Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton's repre&s;entations, added to tho&s;e of Mr. Clare, and the confirming te&s;|timonies of undi&s;gui&s;ed predilection on the part of Olivia, kept John from any parti|cular conference with Henry on the &s;ubject.
<PB N="443" REF="453">There had never been any means of his knowing, that though Henry was mo&s;t fondly loved by Olivia, Olivia never had been, nor ever could be, the choice of Henry. Alas! Olivia had never &s;u&s;pected it her&s;elf; and thus, by a &s;trange concurrence, the one giving form, colour, and countenance, to the other, John and Henry Fitzorton, Charles and Caroline Stuart, and Olivia Clare, were all entangled in a web, out of which there appeared no hope of extrication.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER LIV.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN Fitzorton had no &s;ooner left the grave of Maria, than he continued his way to the village, and pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e where his heart's fir&s;t confidence had been given and betrayed.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e walls," &s;aid he, "enclo&s;ed a beautiful deceiver! true, yet even the man|&s;ions of the ble&s;t, we are told, had their demoniac &s;pirits;&mdash;but did a few degenerate angels make heaven le&s;s the abode of the good?&mdash;And in the vicinity of this polluted
<PB N="444" REF="454">dwelling, had not, at the very moment of its foule&s;t &s;tain, the un&s;ullied Olivia Clare a re&s;idence?&mdash;did Maria's contaminating breath ever reach it? Ah no!&mdash;trembling, almo&s;t de&s;pairing, to &s;ee female integrity pa&s;s beyond the impotent purity of childhood, have I not recently parted from one, whom with a jealous, an almo&s;t malicious eye, I have watched to the e&s;tate of womanhood, with|out finding any affectation &s;trong enough for remon&s;trance, or any error de&s;erving a wo|man hater's reprobation? Alas! I can di&s;cover in her nothing but my own faults!&mdash;She is enriched," continued he, "with more virtue, and that virtue is graced with more beauty, than I can endure the a&s;&s;ociation of, without &s;elfi&s;h and often tormenting thoughts. I can no longer bear &s;uch &s;ociety!&mdash;Ah, how often have the &s;ame feelings driven me from it!&mdash; and how often have I returned to prove my weakne&s;s&mdash;my wickedne&s;s!&mdash;Wretch that I am! is &s;he not betrothed? had &s;he not long ere this been my brother's wife, but for imperious circum&s;tances that po&s;tponed the nuptials?&mdash;Has not every hour, every mo|ment,
<PB N="445" REF="455">&s;hewn me that &s;he has not one beating of her heart which does not vibrate to Henry? &mdash;yet, incorrigible John, in de&s;pite of all this, can only &s;ave him&s;elf from &s;hameful detection by inglorious flight!"</P>
<P>He &s;huddered at him&s;elf, as he pur&s;ued his train of thought; and with hurried &s;teps &s;ought a per&s;on a few miles farther on the road, with whom he had particular bu&s;ine&s;s: for alas! more &s;ecrets yet connect with John.</P>
<P>The name of the per&s;on he now vi&s;ited was Herbert. She was at home.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee," &s;aid John, bowing to her with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and even trembling as he &s;poke, "you &s;ee I am returned alive, and am come to pay you my &s;incere acknow|ledgments, and to &s;ettle accounts, and to make enquiry after the object of our mutual care. And how fares &s;he? ah, how fares the little unfortunate confided with you?&mdash;does &s;he grow in per&s;on, and in mind?&mdash;has &s;he talents?&mdash;has &s;he beauty?&mdash;or gives &s;he the promi&s;es of either?&mdash;more than all, has &s;he all comforts?&mdash;and offers &s;he yet any &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="446" REF="456">toms of a heart that may one day de&s;erve them?&mdash;and is your own heart as firm as I wi&s;h it? and your happine&s;s?&mdash;alas, Mrs. Herbert, how is your happine&s;s?"</P>
<P>She &s;ighed, and was &s;ilent, then after a pau&s;e.</P>
<P>"We are well, my be&s;t friend&mdash;well in health&mdash;nor is either of us unhappy:&mdash;can we be otherwi&s;e under the protection of &s;uch a friend?"</P>
<P>"Call me your foe, your bittere&s;t enemy: call me what alas, I am; neither war nor peace can make me forget."</P>
<P>"My deare&s;t patron, my deare&s;t friend, &s;uch have you been, &s;uch you are; for pity's &s;ake, &s;hift to other &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>"I always love, yet dread to &s;ee you, Amelia."</P>
<P>"I will ring for our Johanna," &s;aid Mrs. Herbert. "O how good &s;he is: how true in mind, how fair in per&s;on! &s;o &s;prightly; yet &s;o timid; &s;o &s;imple, yet &s;o acute. How de|lighted will &s;he be to &s;ee you!"</P>
<P>"Me," cried John, agitated, "how &s;o?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert left the room ha&s;tily, and returned leading in a beautiful young creature;
<PB N="447" REF="457">at the &s;ight of John, &s;he &s;tood rapt in a&s;toni&s;h|ment, then exclaimed, "Good heaven! yes, it mu&s;t be he, the original of my bo&s;omed trea&s;ure!"</P>
<P>John &s;tartled, then recovering, "The power of a few years over that girl, is extra|ordinary," &s;aid he: "don't be alarmed, my dear; I am a rough young &s;oldier: we are perhaps both wondering at one another. You &s;ay &s;he is good, Amelia; is &s;he good enough to hear a&mdash;a&mdash;well-wi&s;her tell her &s;he is beautiful? for that is being good indeed! But I would have that which &s;poils older women, only &s;timulate this girl to merit your report. Yes, you are very beautiful; but you may neverthele&s;s, be more deformed in mind than the mo&s;t ugly creature in the world."</P>
<P>Johanna was aba&s;hed. She found her&s;elf in the pre&s;ence of John Fitzorton! wondrous &s;tories of whom &s;he had heard &s;ince la&s;t &s;he &s;aw him: and remembering the&s;e, &s;he felt awed; and John was, as the reader is aware, an awful man. But, in making an obei&s;ance never taught in the &s;chools, &s;he an&s;wered,
<PB N="448" REF="458">"Yes, honoured Sir, all my books tell me, beauty may be nothing worth; of beauty I know nothing; yet pre&s;ume I mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome traits of what is u&s;ually e&s;teemed &s;uch, or it would not have been imputed to me by my protector."</P>
<P>"Protector!" exclaimed John.</P>
<P>"And of one thing I am convinced, that I had rather be the mo&s;t ugly young woman in the world&mdash;&s;uch honoured &s;ir, you men|tioned &mdash;with a heart &s;en&s;ible of, and grateful for, the thou&s;and goodne&s;&s;es I receive from my governe&s;s and my guardian, than that world's mo&s;t admired beauty, without the &s;acred delight I now feel in this unexpected but long de&s;ired opportunity of paying my duty to the be&s;t of benefactors."</P>
<P>"Benefactors!" reiterated John; "what means that expre&s;&s;ion?"</P>
<P>Tears filled, even to overflowing, the eyes of Johanna, and, attempting to &s;peak, &s;he fell at his feet, cla&s;ped his knees, and called him her "more than father."</P>
<P>"I have been betrayed," cried John.</P>
<P>"Oh!" exclaimed Johanna, di&s;dain not
<PB N="449" REF="459">the effu&s;ions of a heart, that li&s;ted from the du&s;t, glories in acknowledging the hand that rai&s;ed it. Do not, ah, do not, honoured Sir, call it infamy to have that known to me which the God of pity who gave me to your care, mu&s;t look upon with &s;acred plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"What you know cannot be helped, child," &s;aid John, rai&s;ing the &s;uppliant: "I have not time to talk of the&s;e matters at pre&s;ent, having bu&s;ine&s;s with your friend here. Continue to &s;urpri&s;e me as you have done this day, whenever I may happen to &s;ee you, and you &s;hall call me what you will."</P>
<P>After a &s;uitable reply, Johanna withdrew, directing to John, at parting, a look of ten|derne&s;s and veneration.</P>
<P>The man to whom this look was addre&s;&s;ed, had an eye to &s;ee, and a heart to feel &s;uch acknowledgments; but it had been obtained for him, by &s;ome means, to which even the end, gracious as it was, could not be recon|ciled to his peculiar way of thinking.</P>
<P>"Madam," &s;aid he, to Mrs. Herbert, "it is true I merit from you every wound; as you de&s;erve from me all the balms I can
<PB N="450" REF="460">be&s;tow.&mdash;I have to thank you for the care which you have evidently taken of the child's per&s;on. I owe you on another account, alas, more than I can ever &s;ettle,&mdash;but I mu&s;t remove Johanna."</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid!" exclaimed Mrs. Her|bert.</P>
<P>"I knew you wife, and thought you ho|nourable. I knew you was unhappy: I knew I had made you &s;o; I wi&s;hed fervently to offer &s;ome reparation. I gave to you the &s;ociety of an innocent being, who knew not the misfortune of her birth;&mdash;and you have ra&s;hly and officiou&s;ly made her, I &s;ee, ac|quainted with her mother's infamy, her own wretchedne&s;s, and my di&s;honour."</P>
<P>"You are your&s;elf the cau&s;e of what your generous heart wi&s;hed to have concealed, being known to Johanna," returned Mrs. Herbert. "You could not &s;eparate her from the per&s;on in who&s;e arms you fir&s;t &s;aw her."</P>
<P>"The jade!" cried John, "and &s;he has, woman-like, repaid me, for attending to the &s;upplication, with treachery! My own fault indeed! I admit it: for &s;he deluded me once
<PB N="451" REF="461">before, and I was fool enough to tru&s;t her again. I hope, madam, you have turned her out of your hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Alas! &s;he has quitted it more than four months."</P>
<P>"Run away!&mdash;I am glad of it!"</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert &s;hook her head.</P>
<P>"Robbed you too, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;good! but you &s;hall not be a &s;ufferer. An infamous thief as well as trait' re&s;s!"</P>
<P>"Alas, no!"</P>
<P>"Some way done wrong. You are not a woman to turn a dome&s;tic out of your door, while fit to &s;tay within it, Mrs. Herbert."</P>
<P>"I turned her not away, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"I hope &s;he will not get into place again, till &s;he has fully repented."</P>
<P>"Be not &s;o impetuous: I tru&s;t in God that &s;he has repented, and in a much better place now, &s;ir."</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert now told him, that the attendant he had recommended to her was dead; that till her dying moments, &s;he kept the &s;ecret con&s;ided to her; but that in tho&s;e
<PB N="452" REF="462">moments, the attachment which Johanna had conceived for her, made her an almo&s;t con|&s;tant attendant in her chamber, and particu|larly when the &s;ervant was near her end; becau&s;e &s;he had &s;aid &s;he &s;hould die more compo&s;edly if Johanna was near her. Our dear charge was in an adjoining cabinet when the la&s;t prayers were offered to the dying per&s;on, and when, rather in the wan|derings of her departing &s;oul, than in medi|tated treachery, &s;he informed the clergyman, there were &s;ome papers &s;he had put into the bottom of her box, which it would be better to throw into the fire, as the dear child, whom they concerned, was now placed hap|pily. "To be &s;ure, &s;ir, tho&s;e papers being written by the mother belong to the child: but, as I have never mentioned them to her, nor to any body el&s;e, there can be nothing wrong in it."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant lived not to fini&s;h the &s;en|tence, and before the officiating pa&s;tor had opportunity to impart the conver&s;ation, Johanna, feeling her&s;elf fully entitled, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed her&s;elf not only of the papers, but al&s;o
<PB N="453" REF="463">of their &s;ad contents; for they proved a too faithful journal of all that preceded and fol|lowed her mother's fall, and all that con|nected, &s;ir, with your &s;hare in her hi&s;|tory."</P>
<P>"And who ra&s;hly threw that hi&s;tory upon paper?" demanded John, but with no ac|cu&s;ing voice.</P>
<P>"Johanna's mother, &s;ir," an&s;wered Mrs. Herbert.</P>
<P>"It was, perhaps, natural, but I think it was wrong." &s;aid John, indi&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>"The maternal hi&s;torian had embelli&s;hed her &s;ad &s;tory with an etching of its principal character, &s;ir," continued Mrs. Herbert,&mdash; "which &s;he had placed in the front of her narrative, and had written round it, with her own hand, the&s;e words&mdash;'JOHN FITZORTON, THE BEST, AND THE MOST INJURED!"</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid John, extremely affect|ed; "but this, Mrs. Herbert, did not go to that per&s;on's protector&s;hip of the child, which happened not till after that hand was cold in the grave: where then are we to look
<PB N="454" REF="464">for this officious information, to call it no wor&s;e?"</P>
<P>"In another female, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"No doubt," &s;aid John, ironically.</P>
<P>"In the daughter of the worthy proprie|tor of yon almo&s;t de&s;erted man&s;ion," added Mrs. Herbert.</P>
<P>"Olivia Clare!" exclaimed John, with great emotion.</P>
<P>"The old gentleman, you know, &s;ir, now only pays it a vi&s;it of two or three &s;ummer days in the year, and on one of tho&s;e the &s;weet young lady paid a vi&s;it to our little charge, whom, it &s;eems, &s;he had met in &s;ome of her wood walks, when attended only by her maid; &s;ince which mi&s;s Clare had begged to have her at the hall during their annual &s;tay. She always brought her home in her own carriage, but reque&s;ted, for rea|&s;ons, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was not at liberty to ex|plain, I would not mention the matter to any body, unle&s;s it &s;hould appear nece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>John &s;eeming &s;till inclined to li&s;ten, Mrs. Herbert went on,&mdash;"One day our Johanna
<PB N="455" REF="465">came home with eyes that I &s;aw had &s;uffered from weeping, and fre&s;h tears fell from them as I enquired the cau&s;e. She told me, that Mi&s;s Olivia had been reading the papers which had been found in the box; that &s;he had wept over them more bitterly than her|&s;elf: &s;he told her, that the Mr. John Fitz|orton, &s;o often mentioned, was one of the deare&s;t and mo&s;t beloved of her friends; lived often under the &s;ame roof; and though, for &s;ome time pa&s;t he had been on foreign &s;ervice, he was expected home by her and every part of her family with the kinde&s;t impatience: and that upon Johanna's a&s;king whether the etching re&s;embled him, &s;he an|&s;wered that it did; but that &s;he thought her knowledge of his countenance might enable her to make it more &s;o. Whereupon mi&s;s Olivia took out her pencil, and while &s;he retouched the features, related to Johanna a number of circum&s;tances, which induced that &s;weet girl, it &s;eems, to &s;ay,&mdash;'What a happine&s;s, madam, mu&s;t you enjoy to live in family friend&s;hip with &s;uch a man!'
<PB N="456" REF="466">'a happine&s;s, indeed!' replied Olivia Clare, 'I reckon it among&s;t the mo&s;t exalted de|lights with which it has plea&s;ed Providence to &s;urround me.'</P>
<P>"Did &s;he&mdash;it was extremely&mdash;no doubt&mdash; &s;he&mdash;&s;he&mdash;did me too much honour, ma|dam: &mdash;but&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;nothing more pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Yes," continued Mrs. Herbert, "on giving back the drawing, mi&s;s Clare &s;aid, 'I think it now comes nearer to the original; but of that the expre&s;&s;ion is &s;o very power|ful, and goes &s;o very far beyond any imita|tion of life, that'&mdash;'Might I not be permitted to &s;ee the life?' que&s;tioned Johanna, with trembling earne&s;tne&s;s.&mdash;'When he comes down to us,' returned Mi&s;s Clare, "I will watch an opportunity; and if it be po&s;&s;ible, let you have notice.'&mdash;'Meanwhile,' ob|&s;erved Johanna, '&s;hould any chance or de|&s;ign bring him among&s;t a hundred others to my revered and loved Mrs. Herbert, with whom his dear good hand has placed me.'&mdash; 'I think this &s;ketch of his features would
<PB N="457" REF="467">point him out. Indeed I will carry it always about me, that I may be prepared: would I could &s;ee him!'&mdash;'No doubt you will often, my &s;weet girl,' &s;aid mi&s;s Clare; 'but your papers mention that the drawing is but a copy of &s;ome more fini&s;hed likene&s;s.'</P>
<P>Johanna, on coming home, a&s;ked me if I had heard any thing about that likene&s;s, but I could not tell her."</P>
<P>"I could," &s;ighed John,&mdash;"but I am glad that part of the &s;tory has not gone farther."</P>
<P>John ro&s;e, offered his reconciled hand to Mrs. Herbert, to whom he repeated his &s;en&s;e of the injuries he had done her for|merly; then &s;aid, that "he believed the child could not be in better hands, though it was rather unlucky &s;ome &s;pot more remote from part of former events had not been thought of at fir&s;t."</P>
<P>He &s;ighed heavily, and was &s;ilent, at length he took his leave, with a promi&s;e to return, or to write very &s;oon.</P>

<P>WE will not &s;o far in&s;ult our reader's under&s;tanding, as not to &s;uppo&s;e that he has not, long before our declaration, concluded, that the promi&s;ing Johanna was the daugh|ter of the unfortunate Maria; and that her decea&s;ed attendant was the no le&s;s unfortu|nate Betty.</P>
<P>It will be remembered that John Fitzorton had declared the infant &s;hould not lie at the mercy of a forlorn condition, and my&s;terious birth. Uninfluenced by any other motive, than a con&s;ideration of the innocent, he cau&s;ed the child to be placed with one who had been endeared to him by a &s;ingular, and mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous event, which threw her happine&s;s, and her fortunes, on his protection.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e which he had, at fir&s;t, taken for her, &s;tood midway between the village of Maria, and that very &s;eat of Mr. Clare's, where John was a vi&s;itor, when the father of Johanna alienated her mother's affections
<PB N="459" REF="469">from John Fitzorton. We have heard him already regret, that Mrs. Herbert was placed where part of Maria's hi&s;tory had been cir|culated in whi&s;pers; but it was a mea&s;ure of ha&s;te, and almo&s;t immediately after the bu|rial of Maria; and he thought it, on reflec|tion, wi&s;er to fix the child with a woman known and approved, and her&s;elf an object of his "&s;worn attention," than with a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;charged his duty to the living, and to the dead, he continued his journey; and the next object that caught his attention on the way, was the well-remem|bered &s;eat of the Clares, where fir&s;t the lovely Olivia had been the nur&s;e of his wounded &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Something impelled him to check the &s;peed of his hor&s;e, at the fir&s;t view of that man&s;ion, and to go a foot pace, until he had pa&s;t the boundary. He then turned round, rode part of the way back, to gain a point of ground which commanded the whole e&s;tate, and &s;uffered his &s;teed to graze, as he &s;at ob&s;erving the eventful &s;cenery around.
<PB N="460" REF="470">After which, &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he exclaimed, "Deliver me, O God! from temptation." He re&s;umed the reins of his hor&s;e, and proceeded with &s;uch vigour, that as the &s;hades were drawing their thin curtain over the brow of evening, he gained his quarters, where entering, earne&s;tly, upon official employment, the intervals of which were occupied by drawing out a plan of life for the future good of Johanna, he prepared his mind for events, which &s;o far from wi&s;h|ing to prevent, he de&s;ired to promote, and yet which he had never been able to hear or think of, even at the di&s;tance of near two hundred miles, without &s;huddering.&mdash;"Ah, how weak is the &s;tronge&s;t!" would he often &s;ay; "philo&s;ophy is the pigmy, and nature the giant."</P>
<P>John numbered the pencil among&s;t his re&s;ources. It occupied, in this &s;tate of his mind, many an hour that would have been more painfully engaged without its aid; though it occa&s;ionally &s;educed him into &s;ub|jects too near his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="471">A few minutes prior to his quitting the ca&s;tle, Olivia reminded him of a promi&s;e to pre&s;ent her with a likene&s;s of her beloved Henry; "for though I de&s;pair of even John's pencil doing him ju&s;tice, yet you know," &s;aid &s;he, "he is &s;uch a woodland, or mountain wanderer, and &s;o often gets out of &s;ight, that when I cannot have the original, the copy would be company for me.&mdash;Do then, John, think of it."</P>
<P>Some days after joining his regiment, this circum&s;tance came into his mind, and he &s;at down to give the la&s;t touches to the minia|ture. In which employment, having now brought down his &s;tory to the point of time propo&s;ed, taking a retro&s;pective and imme|diate view of him, thereby combining his own portrait, at full length, we are recon|ciled to the bidding him farewell.</P>
