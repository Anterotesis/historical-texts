<HEAD>TO Her Royal Highne&s;s THE PRINCESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT high Station, which by Your Birth You hold above the People, exacts from every one, as a Duty, whatever Honours they are capable of paying to Your Royal High|ne&s;s: But that more exalted Place, to which Your Virtues have rais'd You, a|bove
<PB REF="4">
the re&s;t of Princes, makes the Tribute of our Admiration and Prai&s;e, rather a Choice more immediately preventing that Duty.</P>
<P>The Publick Gratitude is ever founded on a Publick Benefit; and what is univer&s;ally Ble&s;s'd, is always an univer&s;al Ble&s;&s;ing. Thus from Your &s;elf we derive the Offerings which we bring; and that Incen&s;e which ari&s;es to Your Name, only returns to its Original, and but naturally requires the Pa|rent of its Being.</P>
<P>From hence it is that this Poem, con&s;ti|tuted on a Moral, who&s;e End is to recom|mend and to encourage Virtue, of con&s;e|quence has recour&s;e to Your Royal High|ne&s;s's Patronage; a&s;piring to ca&s;t it &s;elf be|neath Your Feet, and declining Approbati|on, 'till You &s;hall conde&s;cend to own it, and vouch&s;afe to &s;hine upon it as on a Crea|ture of Your Influence.</P>
<P>'Tis from the Example of Princes that Virtue becomes a Fa&s;hion in the People, for even they who are aver&s;e to In&s;truction, will yet be fond of Imitation.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
But there are Multitudes, who never can have Means nor Opportunities of &s;o near an Acce&s;s, as to partake of the Benefit of &s;uch Examples. And to the&s;e, Tragedy, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it &s;elf from the Vulgar Poetry by the Dignity of its Characters, may be of U&s;e and Information. For they who are at that di&s;tance from Original Great|ne&s;s, as to be depriv'd of the Happine&s;s of Contemplating the Perfections and real Ex|cellencies of Your Royal Highne&s;'s Per&s;on in Your Court, may yet behold &s;ome &s;mall Sketches and Imagings of the Virtues of Your Mind, ab&s;tracted, and repre&s;ented in the Theatre.</P>
<P>Thus Poets are in&s;tructed, and in&s;truct; not alone by Precepts which per&s;uade, but al&s;o by Examples which illu&s;trate. Thus is Delight interwoven with In&s;truction; when not only Virtue is pre&s;crib'd, but al&s;o re|pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>But if we are delighted with the Liveline&s;s of a feign'd Repre&s;entation of Great and Good Per&s;ons and their Actions, how mu&s;t
<PB REF="6">
we be charm'd with beholding the Per&s;ons them&s;elves? If one or two excelling Quali|ties, barely touch'd in the &s;ingle Action and &s;mall Compa&s;s of a Play, can warm an Au|dience, with a Concern and Regard even for the &s;eeming Succe&s;s and Pro&s;perity of the Actor; with what Zeal mu&s;t the Hearts of all be fill'd, for the continued and encrea&s;ing Happine&s;s of tho&s;e, who are the true and liv|ing In&s;tances of Elevated and Per&s;i&s;ting Vir|tue? Even the Vicious them&s;elves mu&s;t have a &s;ecret Veneration for tho&s;e peculiar Graces and Endowments, which are daily &s;o emi|nently con&s;picuous in Your Royal High|ne&s;s; and though repining, feel a Plea&s;ure which in &s;pite of Envy they per-force ap|prove.</P>
<P>If in this Piece, humbly offer'd to Your Royal Highne&s;s, there &s;hall appear the Re|&s;emblance of any one of tho&s;e many Excel|lencies which You &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;s, to be drawn &s;o as to merit Your lea&s;t Ap|probation, it has the End and Accompli&s;h|ment of its De&s;ign. And however imperfect
<PB REF="7">
it may be in the Whole, through the Inex|perience or Incapacity of the Author, yet, if there is &s;o much as to convince Your Royal Highne&s;s, that a Play may be with Indu&s;try &s;o di&s;pos'd (in &s;pight of the licenti|ous Practice of the Modern Theatre) as to become &s;ometimes an innocent, and not unprofitable Entertainment; it will abun|dantly gratifie the Ambition, and recom|pence the Endeavours of,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Time has been when Plays were not &s;o plenty,</L>
<L>And a le&s;s Number New would well content ye.</L>
<L>New Plays did then like Almanacks appear;</L>
<L>And One was thought &s;ufficient for a Year:</L>
<L>Tho' they are more like Almanacks of late;</L>
<L>For in one Year, I think, they're out of Date.</L>
<L>Nor were they without Rea&s;on join'd together;</L>
<L>For ju&s;t as one progno&s;ticates the Weather,</L>
<L>How plentiful the Crop, or &s;carce the Grain,</L>
<L>What Peals of Thunder, and what Show'rs of Rain;</L>
<L>So t'other can foretel, by certain Rules,</L>
<L>What Crops of Coxcombs, or what Floods of Fools.</L>
<L>In &s;uch like Prophecies were Poets skill'd,</L>
<L>Which now they find in their own Tribe fulfill'd:</L>
<L>The Dearth of Wit they did &s;o long pre&s;age,</L>
<L>Is fall'n on us, and almo&s;t &s;tarves the Stage.</L>
<L>Were you not griev'd, as often as you &s;aw</L>
<L>Poor Actors thre&s;h &s;uch empty Sheafs of Straw?</L>
<L>Toiling and lab'ring, at their Lungs Expence,</L>
<L>To &s;tart a Je&s;t, or force a little Sen&s;e.</L>
<L><PB REF="9">
Hard Fate for us! &s;till harder in th' Event;</L>
<L>Our Authors Sin, but we alone Repent.</L>
<L>Still they proceed, and, at our Charge, write wor&s;e;</L>
<L>'Twere &s;ome Amends if they could reimbur&s;e:</L>
<L>But there's the Devil, tho' their Cau&s;e is lo&s;t,</L>
<L>There's no recovering Damages or Co&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good Wits, forgive this Liberty we take,</L>
<L>Since Cu&s;tom gives the Lo&s;ers leave to &s;peak.</L>
<L>But if provok'd, your dreadful Wrath remains,</L>
<L>Take your Revenge upon the coming Scenes:</L>
<L>For that damn'd Poet's &s;par'd who Damns a Brother,</L>
<L>As one Thief '&s;capes that Executes another.</L>
<L>Thus far alone does to the Wits relate;</L>
<L>But from the re&s;t we hope a better Fate.</L>
<L>To plea&s;e and move has been our Poet's Theme,</L>
<L>Art may direct, but Nature is his Aim;</L>
<L>And Nature mi&s;s'd, in vain he boa&s;ts his Art,</L>
<L>For only Nature can affect the Heart.</L>
<L>Then freely judge the Scenes that &s;hall en&s;ue,</L>
<L>But as with Freedom, judge with Candour too.</L>
<L>He wou'd not lo&s;e thro' Prejudice his Cau&s;e;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd obtain precariou&s;ly Applau&s;e.</L>
<L>Impartial Cen&s;ure he reque&s;ts from all,</L>
<L>Prepar'd, by ju&s;t Decrees to &s;tand, or fall.</L>

<L>THOU ha&s;t already rack'd me with thy Stay;</L>

<SPEAKER>Selim.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Accu&s;ation highly has incens'd</L>
<L>The King, and were alone enough to urge</L>
<L>The Fate of <HI>O&s;myn;</HI> but to that, fre&s;h News</L>
<L>Is &s;ince arriv'd, of more revolted Troops.</L>
<L>'Tis certain <HI>Heli</HI> too is fled, and with him</L>
<L>(Which breeds Amazement and Di&s;traction) &s;ome</L>
<L>Who bore high Offices of Weight and Tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Both in the State and Army. This confirms</L>
<L>The King, in full Belief of all you told him,</L>
<L>Concerning <HI>O&s;myn</HI>'s corre&s;ponding with</L>
<L>The Heads of tho&s;e who fir&s;t began the Mutiny.</L>
<L>Wherefore a Warrant for his Death is &s;ign'd;</L>

<L>Ha! ha&s;te thee! fly, prevent his Fate and mine;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Selim.</SPEAKER>
<L>It needs not, for the King will &s;trait be here,</L>

<L>What &s;hall I &s;ay? Invent; contrive, advi&s;e</L>

<L>I am a Woman, and a Lover &s;till.</L>

From my De&s;pair my Anger had its Source;</L>

<L>Who, at the Place of Execution, will</L>
<L>Attempt to force his way for an E&s;cape.</L>
<L>The State of things will countenance all Su&s;picions</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>THE Tragedy thus done, I am, you know,</L>
<L>No more a Prince&s;s, but <HI>in &s;tatu quo:</HI></L>
<L>And now as unconcern'd this Mourning wear,</L>
<L>As if indeed a Widow, or an Heir.</L>
<L>I've lei&s;ure, now, to mark your &s;ev'ral Faces,</L>
<L>And know each Critick by his &s;our Grimaces.</L>
<L>To poi&s;on Plays, I &s;ee &s;ome where they &s;it,</L>
<L>Scatter'd, like Rats-bane, up and down the Pit;</L>
<L>While others watch like Pari&s;h-Searchers, hir'd</L>
<L>To tell of what Di&s;ea&s;e the Play expir'd.</L>
<L>O with what Joy they run, to &s;pread the News</L>
<L>Of a damn'd Poet, and departed Mu&s;e!</L>
<L>But if he '&s;cape, with what Regret they're &s;eiz'd!</L>
<L>And how they're di&s;appointed if they're pleas'd!</L>
<L>Criticks to Plays for the &s;ame end re&s;ort,</L>
<L>That Surgeons wait on Trials in a Court;</L>
<L>For Innocence condemn'd they've no Re&s;pect,</L>
<L>Provided they've a Body to di&s;&s;ect.</L>
<L>As <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> Men, that dwell upon the Shoar,</L>
<L>Look out when Storms ari&s;e, and Billows roar,</L>
<L><PB REF="78">
Devoutly praying, with uplifted Hands,</L>
<L>That &s;ome well-laden Ship may &s;trike the Sands;</L>
<L>To who&s;e Rich Cargo they may make Pretence,</L>
<L>And fatten on the Spoils of Providence:</L>
<L>So Criticks throng to &s;ee a New Play &s;plit,</L>
<L>And thrive and pro&s;per on the Wrecks of Wit.</L>
<L>Small Hope our Poet from the&s;e Pro&s;pects draws;</L>
<L>And therefore to the Fair commends his Cau&s;e</L>
<L>Your tender Hearts to Mercy are inclin'd,</L>
<L>With whom, he hopes, this Play will Favour find,</L>
<L>Which was an Off'ring to the Sex de&s;ign'd.</L>
