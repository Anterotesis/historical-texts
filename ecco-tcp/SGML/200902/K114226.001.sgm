<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not till I had read this book in print that I thought about a Preface; but on reviewing it, prior to publication, I am convinced that a Preface is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: a &s;ingle period, however, will comprize it.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e volumes, it is po&s;&s;ible the reader may meet with &s;ome
<PB N="iv" REF="3">&s;entiments, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eem unfavourable to the intere&s;ts of virtue, and to the laws of moral life. As the direct contrary is all along intended to be &s;trongly inculcated, the author begs tho&s;e who think proper to turn over his pages, will not abruptly decide on any particular pa&s;&s;ages, which appear liable to objection, but have patience enough to go calmly on, and forbear to pa&s;s judgment till they have fairly &s;een the whole of his argu|ments.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly invited from the reader a candid peru&s;al, I will only detain him a moment longer, to hear a &s;hort account of the work. The mi&s;cellaneous matter here offered, is the re&s;ult of various
<PB N="v" REF="4">efforts, &s;ubmitted, at various opportuni|ties, to the author's literary friends: the drudgery of correction has been obligingly undertaken by tho&s;e friends, to whom he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf indebted, not &s;o much for the ardour of particular com|pliment, as for the frankne&s;s of general critici&s;m.</P>
<P>The poetical parts, when fir&s;t written, were each de&s;igned to &s;tand alone, particu|larly the Elegy of a Nightingale, and the Epi&s;tle from an Unfortunate Lady to her Family. The Anecdotes of a Gentleman, are extracted from a larger work, of which what is now pre&s;ented is little more than the introduction. The primary pages treat of
<PB N="vi" REF="5">Animals, and this part of the performance con&s;i&s;ts of moral Fancy-pieces, from which we proceed to the inve&s;tigation of Facts. In &s;hort, though I have been &s;omewhat immethodical, I have not been totally un|connected, and that I might not tire by &s;ym&s;tematic &s;amene&s;s, I have varied my &s;tyle, as often as I varied my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e kind corrections, however, a very ingenious and well-known gentleman (who&s;e acquaintance with the author is unluckily of later date) has &s;till di&s;covered &s;ome things, which the writer wi&s;hes had not e&s;caped the eyes of others. Perhaps they did not e&s;cape: there is a coy reluctance to find fault, and a dread
<PB N="vii" REF="6">of being too hone&s;t, in ca&s;es of private critici&s;m often fatal; and a writer's re|putation is frequently forfeited by literary conceit on the one hand, and a &s;crupu|lous delicacy on the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e volumes were ready for publica|tion when the gentleman, of whom I la&s;t &s;poke, drew a judicious pen over &s;uch &s;en|tences as he thought might &s;till gain a grace from alteration: but it was too late to avail my&s;elf of his ta&s;te and &s;incerity, or the reader would have received a more fini&s;hed amu&s;ement. However, &s;hould the per|formance thus
<Q>&mdash;&s;ent to its account With its imperfections on its head,</Q>
<PB N="viii" REF="7">have merit enough to plea&s;e the public, the indulgence &s;hall be repaid by the author's care to correct his errors, in a future edi|tion.</P>

<HEAD>LIBERAL OPINIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Am more obliged to you, madam, than I can find language for ac|knowledgment. A &s;entiment of your lady&s;hip's has revived a train of ideas in my mind, which I have at length de|termined to indulge&mdash;Be not alarmed. The &s;entiment, like the &s;ubject, is full of humanity. Ill fare the heart, who&s;e tender bias is circum&s;cribed by the paltry trammels of &s;elf-love, and
<PB N="2" REF="9">can with-hold its benevolence from the minute&s;t part of animated life. There is a deplorable illiberality in the affections of the vulgar: narrowly bigotted to one mean &s;et of no|tions, and confirmed by the ungener|ous maxims that have been inculcated in the early periods of life, they &s;el|dom, or never, ri&s;e to a &s;ingle &s;enti|ment, which reflects dignity either on the head or heart; and the feelings of above half mankind are totally guided by the mo&s;t contracted, and partial prejudices.</P>
<P>In contradiction of the&s;e limited rationals, and in defiance of cu&s;tomary impo&s;itions, I have the fortitude to think, and judge for my&s;elf&mdash;I look on the animal world as very nearly connected with me; and thus pub|licly
<PB N="3" REF="10">declare my&s;elf the &s;incere well|wi&s;her of every living thing. I am now going to addre&s;s your lady&s;hip upon &s;ome very intere&s;ting &s;ubjects: but, as they may po&s;&s;ibly lengthen my enquiries beyond the limits of my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, I &s;hall beg leave to divide my letter into &s;everal parts; both for the relief of your attention, and to afford an opportunity to pau&s;e, till it is agreeable to your lady&s;hip to re&s;ume the book.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE TITLE.</HEAD>
<P>I have called this treati&s;e&mdash;Liberal Opinions, upon intere&s;ting Subjects; the principal of which relate to men,
<PB N="4" REF="11">Providence, and animals. I cho&s;e this mi&s;cellaneous title to give my&s;elf a free &s;cope, and to receive a &s;anction for in|dulging &s;peculations, not ab&s;olutely ti|ed down to the rules of writing. By this, however, I do not mean to run riot in the wilderne&s;s of modern digre&s;&s;ion &mdash; but if, (by turning a little out of the beaten path,) I can catch an ob&s;erv|ation, or pick up a &s;entiment, neglect|ed by &s;uch literary travellers as &s;et out, like a plodding mechanic, with an inflexible re&s;olution to jog &s;trait forwards, though they might enjoy the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pects by the &s;lighte&s;t deviations&mdash;at the &s;ame time, that an ob&s;tinate attachment to the old track, pre&s;ents nothing to the eye which has any novelty to recommend it, nor any thing to the mind that
<PB N="5" REF="12">can give varied gratification.&mdash;There is a &s;ad in&s;ipidity in tho&s;e com|po&s;itions, which are fettered by the chains of critici&s;m. Like the gar|dens of a citizen, we have regu|larity without beauty, and uniformity without ta&s;te. The images &s;tand im|mode&s;tly &s;taring upon each other in exact lines &mdash; the bu&s;ts are placed &s;kulking like q's in a corner, as equi|di&s;tant as the rule can mea&s;ure their &s;paces; while their trees, alcoves, and hedges, (&s;mug as their ma&s;ter's wigs) are cut in the mo&s;t prepo&s;ter|ous manner, and excite the ridicule of every &s;en&s;ible pa&s;&s;enger. Among the countle&s;s quantity of books in our language, there are very few, madam, that abound in original thought. The multiplication of copies is infinite,
<PB N="6" REF="13">and yet it &s;eldom happens that the reader is pre&s;ented with any fre&s;h in|&s;truction, or unhackneyed entertain|ment. I mention not this, becau&s;e I would have you believe I have hit upon a new vein in the mine&mdash;but as it &s;erves my purpo&s;e of making a remark or two on</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE PREJUDICES OF WRITERS AND READERS.</HEAD>
<P>The power of education is as &s;trong, madam, as the appetites of nature, and in nothing more than the habits of writer and reader. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who publi&s;h their &s;enti|ments, have &s;pent their lives rather
<PB N="7" REF="14">in turning over volumes, than in trac|ing accurately the &s;hifting &s;cene, with intent to enrich them&s;elves with ori|ginal ideas&mdash;rather in reading than in thinking. On the other hand the majority of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t ea|ger after the peru&s;al of books, are directed by their tutors to read a cer|tain cla&s;s, on the faith and credit of which, they are to form their future maxims, opinions, and behaviour. Thus both readers and writers go in leading-&s;trings. The one re-print what has been printed by others (with &s;ome &s;light alteration) &mdash; the other con&s;ider tho&s;e tenets incon|te&s;tible, which they have found in their favourite authors, or heard from the lips of friends or ma&s;ters, probably under equal pre|judices.
<PB N="8" REF="15">There are, indeed, certain &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions, the truth of which, like the &s;un at noon, &s;trike unob&s;tructed light upon the mind. To cavil or conjecture again&s;t the&s;e, would be to war with demon&s;tration, and combat with truth and heaven. There are al&s;o a variety of opinions, rendered awful by the general belief of men, which have been adopted as max|ims out of the reach of confutation. Upon this account, if at any time a man hath dared to oppo&s;e any notion, which hath been handed down from fa|ther to &s;on with the &s;ame care as the rent-rolls of the family e&s;tate&mdash;which was put into our mouths with the milk of our mothers, and pinned upon our under&s;tandings as early as the bibs on our bo&s;oms&mdash;what is the con&s;e|quence?
<PB N="9" REF="16">&mdash; He is condemned as a dangerous innovator, &mdash; as one who would over&s;et the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of things&mdash;a &s;y&s;tem which antiqui|ty and truth have made venerable and deci&s;ive&mdash;Strange bigotry&mdash;'tis a dependency, madam, beneath the na|tural freedom of the mind. An in|tellectual obligation is as &s;ervile as a pecuniary one&mdash;one would not, in|deed, like Mandeville, oppo&s;e every thing, from the ob&s;tinate tenacity of founding a new &s;y&s;tem upon the ruins of the old&mdash;for that were as ab&s;urd as &s;etting fire to one's hou&s;e, becau&s;e &s;ome flaws and errors were perceptible through the building&mdash;but it would, methinks, be an act of wi&s;dom to do one's be&s;t to repair it. I have &s;aid thus much as an excu&s;e for &s;ome pe|culiar
<PB N="10" REF="17">&s;entiments which will be di&s;tri|buted through this letter. It is likely that I may advance opinions, not wholly corre&s;pondent to the general imitation of thinking &mdash; for, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that our u&s;ual ideas are derived from a very &s;illy and &s;er|vile imitation&mdash;the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible peo|ple are frequently parrots&mdash;they think as they are bid to think, and talk the dull dialect of their teachers, from the cradle to the coffin. A man of original contemplation, is a prodigy; and (like a prodigy) the eyes of every body are upon him the moment he appears &mdash; even the few which are plea&s;ed with his fortitude, admit the very conviction they feel with &s;ome reluctance&mdash;for we part from nothing we have any length of time been ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="11" REF="18">to venerate&mdash;without pain. &mdash;Thus, many people who have ta|lents for &s;peculation, check the im|pul&s;e to &s;peculate through a di&s;like of being particular. Genius, therefore, ru&s;ts in inactivity, and men content them&s;elves with going on, in the old road, to avoid the charge of &s;ingu|larity, and the &s;miles of deri&s;ion. I have ventured, however, madam, to give the rein to my inclination, and &s;hall ramble from the beaten way of literary traffic, as often as it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of topics, which will at lea&s;t afford an ample field of liberal inquiry, and innocent inve&s;tigation.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>SKETCH OF AN ANIMAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>I have, as your lady&s;hip will re|member, already declared my&s;elf the friend of all the inhabitants which wing the air, or crawl upon the earth: and, although I have the tendere&s;t attachment to my own &s;pecies, and glory in the name of man and chri&s;|tian, yet&mdash;if in my travels through the world, I happen (as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e) to meet in the brute, the in&s;ect, or reptile, tho&s;e endearing qualities, which I look for among&s;t men, in vain, I he&s;itate not to &s;trike a bargain on the &s;pot&mdash;form a &s;trict alliance with the more rational animal, and only

<P>Having &s;aid thus much, your lady|&s;hip will not wonder if, in this letter, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething in defence of tho&s;e gentle dome&s;tics which accom|pany us in our retirements.

<HEAD>A COMPARISON.</HEAD>
<P>Did you never take notice, madam, of two people of different ages &s;ud|denly attracted to each other by the &s;ympathy of ideas. Nothing but the power of plea&s;ant thoughts can effect an a&s;&s;ociation &mdash; the old man &s;its a long time &s;mothered up, in the mi&s;t of his own melancholy &mdash; he hangs his head upon his brea&s;t, fixes his eyes over the fire, and &s;eems to be employ|ed in &s;ome profound &s;peculation: the fatigue, however, of thinking, proves too laborious, and he is at length rocked to &s;leep, in the cradle of his reflections. In the mean time, his favourite boy is left to cater for him&s;elf. The eye of a child converts every trifle into an object of enter|tainment,
<PB N="17" REF="24">and every pretty unimport|ance is e&s;teemed, a joyful acqui&s;ition. The father, after the refre&s;hments of his nap, (that nepenthe of age) awakes &mdash;the &s;tripling is acting, the kitten on the floor, and ingeniou&s;ly exerts a thou&s;and little efforts, to vary its amu&s;ement. Age, &s;urveys the picture, and recalls ideas which bring to mind the moments when he was him&s;elf the happy harlequin of the carpet&mdash; a tear drops involuntarily, which is &s;ucceeded by a &s;mile. At length the di&s;tance of ages is forgotten; the ve|teran is caught in the charm of chear|ful retro&s;pection, forgets awhile the decrepitude of the la&s;t &s;tage, and mixes in the whim&s;ical and puerile gratifi|cations of the fir&s;t.</P>

Many a time, when the &s;torms of the world have blown hard upon my head, even till the violence of the &s;hock a&s;&s;ailed my heart&mdash;when the eye of friend&s;hip became inverted, by ill &s;ucce&s;s, and when I looked in vain around me for the benevolence of &s;ympathy, and the con&s;olations of human attachment&mdash; in tho&s;e de&s;titute moments (to the &s;hame of man) came that affectionate adherent&mdash;and (with an officiou&s;ne&s;s of love, which wanted not the elo|quence
<PB N="25" REF="32">of words to be under&s;tood) taught me to take refuge in re&s;ign|ation, and in his company &s;et at defiance the malice of vici&s;&s;itude.

<P>Your lady&s;hip will ob&s;erve, that the above addre&s;s will equally &s;uit all ages, characters, &s;exes, and con|ditions.

<HEAD>FRAGMENT OF &mdash; Adventures.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash; Born with one of the tendere&s;t hearts, BENIGNUS, at a very early pe|riod, began to &s;earch for a friend: from the age of fifteen to the age of thirty-two were his labours unwearied &mdash; and unrewarded. At length, hav|ing wa&s;ted his fortune and &s;pirits, he gave up the endeavour in de&s;pair, and retiring to a fore&s;t on the banks of the&mdash;he &s;pent the latter days of his life in animal &s;ociety &mdash; No hu|man being was invited to his hut&mdash;
<PB N="73" REF="80">no human form was &s;ollicited to ap|proach it. In view of the &s;moke of the metropolis he lived as an hermit; and re&s;olved never more to &s;ee the face of man. It happened, however, that in the year 1768 he fell &s;ick, and having laid till his di&s;temper had got beyond the reach of medicine, and till his collection of creatures were wa&s;ted to the bone, he crawled, by painful ef|forts, from his bed to the door of his cottage, and fa&s;tening thereto a written label, with the&s;e words,
<Q>THE PROPERTY OF THE FIRST TRA|VELLER,</Q>
he &s;taggered back again to his couch. I was, at this cri&s;is, madam, upon my re|turn to town from a rural excur&s;ion; and as I always loved to explore the mo&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="81">unfrequented paths, in order to diver|&s;ify the pro&s;pects of my journey, I be|held, through the ob&s;tructions of a great number of trees, &s;omething like the abode of a fellow-creature. I hung my hor&s;e at the next hedge, and re|&s;olved to &s;atisfy my de&s;ire to know <HI>what</HI> man had cho&s;en &s;o pa&s;toral a &s;itu|ation, in an age when the ideas of Ar|cadia are treated as the fables of the brain. It was with &s;ome toil I tore my way through the bu&s;hes&mdash; for footing &s;aw I none&mdash;at length I arrived at the &s;tructure, and read the &s;entiment on the label. Fear now ope|rated as &s;trongly as curio&s;ity&mdash;I knew not whether to go forward, or to re|treat. It might po&s;&s;ibly be the refuge of a robber, and the in&s;cription on the door might be a trap for the in|cautious
<PB N="75" REF="82">wanderer. I gave way, how|ever, to my favourite inclination, and pulled the latch that admitted me into the cottage.&mdash;</P>
<P>The furniture of the apartment &s;truck me dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash; for the groans of the dying, and the &s;ituations of the dead, re&s;embled ra|ther a charnel-hou&s;e, than the cottage of &s;implicity&mdash;birds of various &s;ort were laying dead in their cages&mdash;dogs and &s;quirrels were writhing in the la&s;t agony&mdash;the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion was ju&s;t expired, and one poor &s;olitary cat empre&s;s of the dominion, &s;eemed to eye the dead as her natural pro|perty.&mdash;</P>
<P>In a chri&s;tian country&mdash;nay, in a fore&s;t &s;o near to, I was doubly amazed at the&s;e &s;hocking circum|&s;tances&mdash;what
<PB N="76" REF="83">mea&s;ure to pur&s;ue I knew not. Upon ca&s;ting my eyes round the room, I &s;aw a &s;mall trunk, and at the end of that &s;everal &s;mall &s;acks. Upon looking into the box, I found it full of manu&s;cripts, which immediately commanded my attention, and upon examination of papers, I &s;oon found the &s;ecret of this extraordinary per&s;on's birth and connexions. I &s;ought out his relations by the clue his letters and memorandums had given me,&mdash; they were people of rank, and as he ab&s;conded from every body &s;uddenly, they judged him to have been either drowned or murdered. However, the dead body was re&s;tored to the family, and now &s;leeps with its ance&s;tors in * * * *.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="84">
To this very enterprize, however, I am indebted for &s;omething that I value, madam, beyond every other worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I found it wrapt curiou&s;ly up in a &s;mall bag of crim&s;on velvet, in a little private drawer at the bottom of the trunk which contained the manu&s;cripts; and it was after|wards given to me as a rewarding pre|&s;ent by the relations of Benignus, for the di&s;covery. It accounts, for every peculiarity in the conduct of the unhappy man in who&s;e cottage it was found; and although it cannot defend his total de&s;ertion of &s;ociety, in the opinion of the world, yet it hath &s;o endeared his memory to me, that I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure followed his example, and adopted many of his &s;entiments ever &s;ince.</P>

<P>&mdash;As &s;ome explanations may be thought nece&s;&s;ary for leaving the world after having mixed in it for a number of years,&mdash;and for not tran&s;|mitting any account of my&s;elf &s;ince the fir&s;t hour of my &s;eque&s;tration, I

But as I &s;hall write down the&s;e matters at my hours of lei&s;ure, when they interfere not with the duties of my dome&s;tic family, I &s;hall divide the adventures into &s;e|parate chapters, that I may take up or lay down the pen, as I think proper.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>The hi&s;tory of my very babyhood is peculiar&mdash;I was certainly born to be
<PB N="80" REF="87">the &s;port of fortune.&mdash;The day which gave me to the world, took my mo|ther out of it; and a month after|wards my father caught a fever,&mdash; &s;ickened and followed her. Thus was I an orphan in the nur&s;ery&mdash;I &s;oon di&s;|covered a love of &s;ociety&mdash;My guar|dian (who was a clergyman) provided me with books, and little compa|nions, and put out my fortune (which con&s;i&s;ted of twelve thou&s;and pounds in &s;pecie) at intere&s;t. The books which he put into my hands were the Spectators.&mdash;They fir&s;t put me upon &s;peculation, and my young friends led me into relaxations of amu&s;ement. I had not the general objections of a boy to &s;chool, becau&s;e I was eager af|ter every &s;ort of knowledge. I took my in&s;tructions in proportion to my
<PB N="81" REF="88">application&mdash;but in all my readings and re&s;earches, the attachment to my fel|low-creatures was my fir&s;t and favour|ite pa&s;&s;ion. Benevolence was the leading principle of my life. I con&s;i|dered my&s;elf as born to the great duty of making every body happy around me. A virtuous &s;entiment warmed my heart, a tender &s;tory wetted my eye&mdash;my hand was open to di&s;|tre&s;s in every form, and I was always ready to give the allowance of my childhood to the alleviation of mi&s;ery &mdash;the Spectators which were all the private library I had at this time&mdash;with Virgil, Homer, Sallu&s;t, and other of my &s;chool books, were all full of expre&s;|&s;ions which encouraged me, in my generous principle: they one and all declared, that
<Q>To be good, was to be happy.</Q></P>

<P>Upon this noble principle I re|&s;olved to begin&mdash;continue&mdash;and end my ex&s;tience&mdash;I wrote concerning my re&s;olution to my guardian&mdash;he confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed the maxim, and concluded by a&s;&s;uring me that the only way
<Q>To be happy, was to be good.</Q></P>
<P>There are few &s;ituations in life, more plea&s;ing, than the contempla|tions of a young mind, upon the &s;ub|ject of univer&s;al happine&s;s. The the|ory of the&s;e ideas is delightful&mdash;the practice is &s;ometimes a little mortify|ing
<PB N="83" REF="90">e&s;pecially to young people. I began to put in force my &s;y&s;tem im|mediately: I entered into the com|mon plea&s;ure of a &s;chool-boy, and tried every po&s;&s;ible method to endear my|&s;elf to my companions. Whenever they committed a childi&s;h fault, I took the blame upon my&s;elf&mdash;when|ever any di&s;putes aro&s;e, I endeavoured to compromi&s;e the matter to the gene|ral tranquillity; and whenever they broke any of their toys, I privately repaired the lo&s;s with new ones. But &s;ome how or another, the&s;e efforts did not turn out quite &s;atisfactorily. I got &s;everal &s;evere whippings for fa|thering errors which were not my own; I was &s;tigmati&s;ed by the lads as a bu&s;y body, for interfering with quarrels which did not concern me;
<PB N="84" REF="91">and I was accu&s;ed of partiality for making pre&s;ents to one playmate in preference to another. And thus my benevolence was in the very fir&s;t out&s;et, rewarded with &s;everity, and contempt. However I was too well grounded in the truth of my grand principle, and had indeed naturally too tender an heart, to &s;uffer a few &s;light mortifications to relax the vi|gour of my virtue. The morning of life is the meridian of genero&s;ity, and though I was a little mi&s;erable at my di&s;appointment, I made my&s;elf cer|tain, that if I continued
<Q>To be good, I &s;hould certainly be happy&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>&mdash; A number of the boys had one day formed a party to rob the or|chard of a neighbouring farmer, and from the orchard had pre-deter|mined to march to the hen-roo&s;t, and then return with their &s;poils to their &s;everal chambers. Intelligence of this was communicated to me by a boy who was piqued at being unengaged in the adventure. The &s;hock I felt at the news is indi&s;cribable. The next evening was to be the time fixt for the perpetration of the fact. It was altogether a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o repugnant to all the precepts I had read, and &s;o im|mediately combated my notions of
<PB N="86" REF="93">benevolence that I trembled at the idea&mdash;I turned over the Spectators&mdash; every paper was flat again&s;t it. I knew not what to do. The mo&s;t anxi|ous &s;tate of the mind, is the agitation of divided and irre&s;olute reflections. I was bewildered betwixt two mea&s;ures, unknowing which to choo&s;e or which to reject. The que&s;tions to be de|bated were the&s;e: Shall I prevent this bad action by expo&s;tulating with the boys, or by acquainting the ma&s;ter of the de&s;ign to commit it?&mdash; the tenderne&s;s of my heart repre|&s;ented a general flaggellation, as the reward of the latter; and I there|fore cho&s;e the former. When once a &s;cheme of this kind is formed by a &s;et of boys, there is a &s;ort of inflexi|ble attachment among the con&s;pirators,
<PB N="87" REF="94">that has all the &s;olemnity of a plot up|on the government: every lip is &s;eal|ed, and every eye is wary&mdash;I found the banditti (a part from the re&s;t of of the boys) gathered together in the true circle of con&s;ultation&mdash;head with|in head, and arm within arm&mdash;I in|troduced the &s;ubject &s;o as to &s;often its atrociou&s;ne&s;s. Endeavoured as a friend&mdash;a &s;chool-fellow and a compa|nion&mdash;to di&s;&s;uade them from &s;o di&s;|hone&s;t an attempt: argued with them as from play-mate to play-mate, and conjured them to de&s;i&s;t,&mdash;promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time to purcha&s;e the <HI>very</HI> objects of their pre&s;ent machinations out of my own pocket&mdash;they heard me out without any other interrup|tion, than &s;tifled titterings&mdash;winks, nods, and knocks again&s;t the elbows
<PB N="88" REF="95">of each other&mdash;but at the conclu&s;ion, the general plea&s;antry was no longer to be di&s;gui&s;ed, and they bur&s;t out into a downright laugh. As &s;oon as they had &s;atisfied their appetite of deri&s;ion, they a&s;&s;umed a more &s;erious air, called me a li&s;tner, a poor, cow|ardly brat, without &s;pirit for glori|ous enterprize&mdash;bid me &s;tick to my books, and at la&s;t &s;et up a great &s;hout, and fairly hi&s;&s;ed me from their &s;ociety.</P>

<P>&mdash; I retired to my chamber, and bur&s;t into tears: a train of reflec|tions pre&s;&s;ed hard upon my heart, and (in &s;pite of all my belief in the recti|tude of my favourite maxim) I could not help arguing with my&s;elf&mdash;What
<PB N="89" REF="96">(&s;aid I) is it nece&s;&s;ary that in the effort to do good to others, I mu&s;t make my&s;elf mi&s;erable? Well, well, no matter: the&s;e little mi&s;carriages are but &s;o many trials of my integrity. As the gold comes purified from the fire, &s;o, no doubt, &s;hall my happine&s;s come augmented from trifling anxie|ties, magnanimou&s;ly &s;u&s;tained.

<PB N="91" REF="97">the &s;ecret in my brea&s;t. The anxiety of &s;uppre&s;&s;ion had already half-di&s;|tracted me. I &s;aw my ma&s;ter reading in the garden, and immediately ran to him. An act of real fraud mu&s;t be done or prevented within half an hour; I loved my play-mates, but I loved my principles yet more&mdash;after many he&s;itations, and begging their only puni&s;hment might be a falutary lecture of reproof, I un&s;olded the whole &s;cheme. The ma&s;ter looked extremely &s;olemn, while I was &s;peaking, but how was I amazed at the conclu&s;ion, to &s;ee half a &s;mile prevail over the habitual wrinkles of his forehead. He bid me "not be &s;o much concerned&mdash;that boys would be boys&mdash;that robbing orchards and hen-roo&s;ts, were a &s;ort of petty|larceny, which the little pilferers
<PB N="90" REF="98">would commit in defiance of the rod; and that, though he &s;hould not encour|age theft, yet that &s;uch &s;mall depreda|tions, upon apples and poultry, were always among the adventures of every lad of &s;pirit, and that it would not be political in a ma&s;ter to whip them vio|lently away, le&s;t it &s;hould hurt their fu|ture courage to combat the adver&s;ities of life&mdash;ob&s;erving, (in the clo&s;e of his ha|rangue,) that in general tho&s;e children made the be&s;t men, which were fore|mo&s;t in &s;uch puerile archievements"&mdash; I bowed, and withdrew. Fre&s;h think|ing brought on fre&s;h perplexity&mdash;I fell again to &s;oliloquy. He that &s;teals a chicken, &s;aid I, at ten years old, may be tempted to take a pur&s;e at twenty &mdash;I rambled very far in the labyrinth of reflection&mdash;I could make nothing
<PB N="92" REF="99">of it&mdash;I gave up the point with the following remark&mdash;The ma&s;ter and the boys are both wrong&mdash;I have done <HI>my</HI> duty, and my con&s;cience is di&s;|charged of a very great load.&mdash;With|out di&s;pute
<Q>To be good, is to be happy.</Q></P>
<P>The next morning&mdash;for my ma&s;ter did not think fit to flog for an in|tended error&mdash;but &s;uffered the fact to be fir&s;t committed&mdash;the next morn|ing, a charge was produced again&s;t the offenders, and I was pointed out as their accu&s;er. In this, however, the ma&s;ter was di&s;ingenuous, for my evidence was utterly unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash; the proofs being found on the very per&s;ons of the parties, as their wai&s;t|coats, and coats and &s;tockings, were
<PB N="93" REF="100">covered with the down and the feathers of their trophies, and the pockets of every delinquent, like the panniers of a fruiterer, &s;tuck pre|po&s;terou&s;ly out from each &s;ide, and betrayed the prog and vegetable &s;poils within. However, I &s;tood forth, be|ing called upon, in defence of my ve|racity. The culprits were by no means hardened in the habit of error, and the deep blu&s;h of every cheek betrayed &s;ilent confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;The bill was found again&s;t them, and the &s;en|tence of whipping was executed on the &s;pot&mdash;The cry was piercing, and went to my heart&mdash;how readily would I have partaken the angui&s;h.&mdash;As &s;oon as this exerci&s;e was over, my ma&s;ter went out of the &s;chool&mdash;before his back was well turned, the very
<PB N="94" REF="101">objects of his di&s;cipline began to mi|mic, and make faces at him, and as &s;oon as they judged him to be out of hearing, the whole &s;chool was up in arms again&s;t me, who they a&s;per&s;ed as a little paltry puppy, which ought to be knocked on the head for telling tales out of &s;chool. News was now brought in, that as the ma&s;ter was &s;eized with an head-ach, and could not attend &s;chool, the chief boy mu&s;t go through the bu&s;ine&s;s of the morn|ing in his &s;tead. The boys took ad|vantage of this hour of &s;ecurity, and in&s;tantly revenged the di&s;cipline they had received for my information, ten|fold upon me. They buffeted me with their hats, &s;purted ink upon my cloaths, &s;pit in my face, kicked me in the breech, and loaded me with every
<PB N="95" REF="102">in&s;ult, that a &s;et of barbarous brats could po&s;&s;ibly inflict upon the cat which they had tied to the &s;take. In conclu&s;ion&mdash;not a boy would &s;it near me&mdash;I was avoided as a pe&s;tilence, and &s;ome of the &s;marte&s;t actually made ver&s;es on my TREASON, as they called it, and &s;ung them about the yard to ludicrous tunes.&mdash;My &s;en&s;ations at the&s;e in&s;ults, were a mixture of ten thou&s;and feelings, at the &s;ame mo|ment.</P>
<P>For a long time after this tran&s;|action, I &s;carce exchanged ten words with any one, but wandered up and down the yard, in a &s;ad, &s;olitary man|ner, like a di&s;tempered &s;heep, di&s;|carded and beaten from the flock.&mdash; Sometimes indeed an arch wag would tell me a &s;orrowful hi&s;tory of his lo&s;|&s;es,&mdash;the
<PB N="96" REF="103">breaking of a hoop or the de|molition of a top; but as &s;oon as he had obtained his end, he would &s;idle off to his old companions, and putting out his tongue, tell how cleverly he had taken in the INFORMER.</P>
<P>Thus was I cu&s;&s;ed, mocked, hooted at, and de&s;erted, for endeavouring to prevent an action, which I thought, on all hands, unlawful, and unbene|volent. I again took up my dear Spectators, and in tho&s;e ine&s;timable volumes, I found that the only way to felicity was to PERSEVERE in well doing.&mdash;This &s;entiment was like a cordial to a fainting man.&mdash;I &s;hut the book, walked chearfully acro&s;s my chamber, and re&s;olving to per&s;evere, concluded as u&s;ual, that

<P>&mdash; At the end of about two months, the &s;everity of my fate be|gan to remit of its rigour. Perpetu|ated malignity is not often the vice of a &s;chool-boy. As I was altogether of a &s;ocial turn, I even went &s;o far as to purcha&s;e a reconciliation, at the price of a few conce&s;&s;ions. But the greate&s;t progre&s;s towards a re|union betwixt me and the boys, was made by a &s;kilful di&s;tribution of pre|&s;ents and promi&s;es&mdash;for (however &s;trange it may &s;eem) the influence of money is not greater in the &s;tate, than in the &s;chools.

<P>&mdash;IN TIMES OF OLD there lived a man near a great fore&s;t. He was a keeper of &s;heep, and had, (as the &s;tory goes,) a very large family.&mdash;Some of his children were grown up and &s;ome were infants. One was in the cra|dle and two were upon the lap. The mother was a noted &s;pinner, and &s;he &s;et all the girls to work, as &s;oon as they could hold the wool in their hands, and had &s;treagth enough to turn round the wheel: while the father took care to find out-of|door bu&s;ine&s;s for the boys&mdash;&s;ome were herdboys, and &s;ome that were too weak for hard work, &s;cared the birds from corn&mdash;now it is reported by the neigh|bours
<PB N="103" REF="110">of the adjacent village that the old &s;hepherd was a mighty odd character, and that he bred up his family in a very different manner from the maxims of his poor neighbours. As he was unable to give them the ad|vantage of an education like ours, and teach them Latin and Greek, he was re|&s;olved to educate them in &s;uch accom|pli&s;hments as his &s;ituation permitted.

The clergyman, to whom my father thought proper to leave the direction of his affairs, was as hone&s;t, and inoffen&s;ive a prie&s;t, as ever harangued from a pulpit. He was e&s;teemed by his pari&s;hioners profoundly learned, in&s;o|much, that &s;carce any bu&s;ine&s;s was done in the village without his know|ledge. From his wi&s;dom and friend|&s;hip I expected great &s;atisfaction, and
<PB N="121" REF="128">anticipated the return of the po&s;t, with all imaginable plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Anticipation of plea&s;ure however is the very de&s;truction of it. The returning po&s;t came, and brought me a BLACK SEAL&mdash;my guardian had died of an apoplexy, an hour after the receipt of my letter, which he was preparing to an&s;wer. I was &s;um|moned &s;uddenly away to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his papers, for the good man having no family, nor any connexions, which were dearer to him than the &s;on of the friend of his youth, had, in the fondne&s;s of his heart, made his la&s;t &s;entiments in my favor, and indeed left me &s;ole excutor. The &s;ud|denne&s;s of the circum&s;tance, at fir&s;t &s;tunned me&mdash;I put the letter of death into the hand of my ma&s;ter&mdash;begged
<PB N="122" REF="129">he would &s;uffer me to &s;et out directly, and flung my&s;elf into a chair&mdash;the tears came at la&s;t. I loved the decea&s;ed beyond expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;without attend|ing to what was &s;aid to me&mdash;I got into a chai&s;e, and drove to * * * *.</P>

<P>To young men of a &s;erious com|plexion, the chamber of death is inexpre&s;&s;ibly terrible, e&s;pecially when the body of a benefactor is extended on the bed.&mdash;At a proper time, I tru&s;t|ed him to the bo&s;om of the earth, with every mark of decency, and affection: and at length I ventured to read over his will, and take account of
<PB N="123" REF="130">his effects&mdash;my youth, and experience un&s;itting me for the&s;e affairs, I called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an attorney who re&s;ided at a market town three miles from the village, who had indeed drawn up the te&s;tament for my guar|dian. To the judgment of this gen|tleman, who bore a fair reputation, I tru&s;ted. Till he came indeed the hou&s;e might very properly be termed an hou&s;e of mourning, for a great concour&s;e of &s;able looking people were crowding together into every room. The whole village was actually empti|ed into the vicarage: I found they came upon two di&s;tinct errands. To <HI>condole,</HI> and to <HI>congratulate.</HI> They were va&s;tly &s;orry their good pa&s;tor was gone, but they were extremely glad that I was come, and heartily
<PB N="124" REF="131">wi&s;hed me many happy years. I re|turned them thanks for the latter part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and wept with them for the fir&s;t. The lawyer appeared. They fled. Mourners of this kied dete&s;t an attorney&mdash;perhaps becau&s;e he knows them better than a raw &s;chool-boy. My hou&s;e was cleared in a moment. It is not without very pe|culiar propriety I make u&s;e of the word <HI>cleared,</HI> for I &s;oon found that tho&s;e very weepers and wailers, were no other than &s;ome of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> birds of prey, that watch the mortality of an human body, &s;cent the carca&s;e from afar, and vulture like immediately proceed to plunder. They cried in|deed with their eyes, but not chu&s;ing to hold up an handkerchief to wipe them, their pickers and &s;tea|lers
<PB N="125" REF="132">were at liberty, to &s;ecrete certain portable moveables, which perhaps they might take a particular fancy to Poor wretches, they did not know that
<Q>To be good, was to be happy!</Q></P>
<P>Upon in&s;pection into matters, it appeared that the good clergyman had died worth three thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides his dwelling hou&s;e (which he built), a large garden, a &s;mall paddock adjoining his garden, and a con&s;ider|able quantity of furniture. (His living fell again into the hands of the pa|tron.) The whole of the above he had given to me, &s;ubjected to the payment of a &s;mall legacy of 100l. to a very di&s;|tant relation, and twenty pounds to the
<PB N="126" REF="133">poor of the village, to be di&s;tributed among&s;t the propere&s;t objects, on the &s;econd Sunday after his decea&s;e&mdash;By the will of my own father, it was re|que&s;ted, that my guardian, would nominate a &s;econd in ca&s;e of his own death during my infancy. This ap|pointment my father neglected to do him&s;elf, perhaps becau&s;e he wi&s;hed to pay a compliment to the good cler|gyman. But being him&s;elf an hearty man, he had not made over the tru&s;t, and as he died &s;uddenly, the &s;ole di&s;|po&s;al both of the fortune left by my father, and the fortune left by my guardian, came naturally to my di&s;|cretion. I expre&s;&s;ed a &s;urprize at this&mdash;the attorney &s;aid it was cer|tainly an <HI>over&s;ight</HI> in my guardian&mdash;
<PB N="127" REF="134">we were both a good while &s;ilent. The lawyer &s;ubmitted it to me as an act of <HI>prudence,</HI> whether I would choo&s;e my&s;elf to appoint a tru&s;tee, till I came of age, and there was I re|member an egoti&s;m in his looks, which &s;eemed to a&s;k me what I &s;hould think of <HI>him</HI> for that office? I told him I would take a day to deliberate upon it, and con&s;ult with him again.</P>

<P>Now of all the things upon earth, I knew the lea&s;t how to manage money, and yet I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of near twenty thou&s;and pounds, including the accumulated intere&s;t of the twelve
<PB N="128" REF="135">thou&s;and, left by my father&mdash;a thought came &s;uddenly acro&s;s me, which de|termined me at once&mdash;the power of a plea&s;ant idea when the &s;oul is gloomy, operates like an unexpected &s;unbeam, darting through an hemi|&s;phere of clouds&mdash;the &s;ky and the face, the element and the whole ma|chine of man, are in tho&s;e ca&s;es equally bright and delightful&mdash;'twas &s;o with me. As I am now ma&s;ter of twenty thou&s;and pounds, &s;aid I, I &s;hall be able to make many of my <HI>good</HI> fellow-crea|tures <HI>happy,</HI>&mdash;I will neither return to &s;chool nor attend lethargic univer&s;ities, but in&s;tantly &s;tep into life, and, mixing with mankind, indulge at once my cu|rio&s;ity, and my benevolence.&mdash;With|out more ado I wrote to the attorney, that I intended to travel, and &s;hould
<PB N="129" REF="136">therefore want my ready money left by my guardian; and that, the &s;um which was already inve&s;ted in the funds, might remain. The law|yer did not &s;eem to like the mea|&s;ure, but for the fir&s;t time in my life, I ran the ri&s;que of di&s;obliging another, to gratify my&s;elf: 'twas not perhaps &s;trictly benevolent, yet as it was the fir&s;t petulance I ever indulged, the idea of the error came &s;oftened upon my under&s;tanding&mdash; happy had it been for me, if in|&s;tead or &s;tepping into life, and put|ting money in my pur&s;e, I had &s;at quietly down in the chimney-corner, and, like the virtuo&s;o in the comedy, travelled only in my Books.&mdash;</P>

<P>I was now condemned to that &s;ort of drudgery, which cu&s;tom and com|plai&s;ance have impo&s;ed upon men ju&s;t &s;tepped into a fortune.&mdash;The gen|try of the neighbourhood came upon the commerce of vi&s;itings; and the poor of my pari&s;h, and all the pari&s;hes adjacent, were at my gate, upon the &s;ubject of charity. I have &s;ince found out, that the&s;e were pickpockets of different kinds. At that time, how|ever, I thought of them very differ|ently&mdash;the rich I received with cordial|ity, and the poor never went away empty-handed; and yet by &s;ome &s;trange waywardne&s;s and perver&s;ene&s;s of my &s;tars&mdash;my ill-luck&mdash;or what|ever
<PB N="133" REF="140">el&s;e influenced the events of my life, I had never the good fortune to &s;atisfy either. Benevolence was &s;till the motive, but felicity was not the effect. My heart was one of tho&s;e, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide in the brea&s;t of a &s;tripling, impre&s;&s;ed in the nur&s;ery, with a &s;en&s;e of that great &s;ocial duty, extending from earth to heaven&mdash;the duty which beginning with GOD, de&s;cends to <HI>man,</HI> and ter|minates in <HI>brute.</HI> With a natural in|clination to gentlene&s;s, I &s;oon acquir|ed from the Bible and Spectators, an habit of <HI>thinking,</HI> as well as <HI>feeling</HI> right. Never indulging my&s;elf in tho&s;e boyi&s;h feats which &s;ow in chil|dren the fir&s;t fatal &s;eeds of cruelty, in|ju&s;tice, and ingratitude, I in &s;ome &s;ort acquired a degree of primitive purity
<PB N="134" REF="141">in my ideas, that carried me into that line of action, which I then thought the road to happine&s;s, but which I now perceive the certain path to indignity and di&s;grace. With &s;uch a heart, and with &s;uch pro|pen&s;ities and principles belonging to it, I loved all&mdash;thought well of all&mdash; embraced all. With the &s;ad I &s;ympa|thized&mdash;with the happy I exulted; and to &s;uch as had none to help them, but he who bids the primro&s;e &s;pring mode&s;tly round my pre&s;ent retreat, I gave the comforts which even the eco|nomy of nature demanded. Perhaps no man was ever accoutered with weapons of wor&s;e defence, to &s;truggle through the warfare of life, than the principles and propen&s;ions I have mentioned.</P>

<P>About this time happened the Sun|day on which the legacy of twenty pounds was to be divided among&s;t
<PB N="141" REF="148">&s;uch objects, as more immediately &s;tood in need of the donation. After morning &s;ervice, I had reque&s;ted the clerk to &s;ummon all tho&s;e mendicants into the ve&s;try, which he knew to be particular|ly indigent and de&s;erving. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to do things privately in a village: it was &s;oon known to the whole pari&s;h, that the favour of their bene|factor was on this day to be di&s;tribut|ed, and accordingly, the church was on this day crouded with more poor people than had been known there for many years.</P>
<P>Too many of them were led thither by the hand of hope rather than of reli|gion. The money was divided by the curate of the next pari&s;h, who officiated at both that and my guardian's, &s;ince the death of the latter. He was an up|right
<PB N="142" REF="149">character, knew every inhabi|tant, and was therefore a proper per|&s;on for &s;uch an office.&mdash;The people a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, went &s;atisfied away, and I was truly of opinion that
<Q>To be good, was to be happy.</Q>
At the porch of the church, as the curate, the clerk, and I were go|ing home, we were intercepted, by the &s;ight of a pretty large multi|tude, every member of which &s;eemed to be vi&s;ited by all the afflictions of Lazarus. Lamene&s;s, blindne&s;s, filth, and nakedne&s;s, were here in the mo&s;t formidable array: Their numbers baffled computation, and every one's bu&s;ine&s;s appeared to be, how he could mo&s;t effectually appeal to my
<PB N="143" REF="150">compa&s;&s;ion. The ho&s;pital at Chel&s;ea, could &s;carce have produced &s;uch a con|gre&s;s of invalids. The clerk was for driving them away with his wand&mdash; I prevented this, and enquired for what they a&s;&s;embled. In the true key of complaint, they God-ble&s;&s;ed my honour, and &s;aid, it was for <HI>money.</HI> The curate replied, the mo&s;t needy were already relieved.&mdash;The beggars di&s;played their tattered garments, lean looks, and imperfect limbs. I did not know what to do. The clerk bid them go home to their own pari&s;hes, for that they did not belong to us. I put my hand into my pocket&mdash;my pur&s;e was empty&mdash;I bid them come to my gate within an hour&mdash;they came, and I de&s;ired the clerk to divide 20l. <HI>more</HI> upon them, a &s;um which I
<PB N="144" REF="151">very luckily happened to have in <HI>halfs crowns,</HI> a kind of pieces which my guardian was always fond of hoard|ing. In ten minutes after the clerk di&s;appeared, I heard a violent noi&s;e at at my gate: the beggars, di&s;&s;atisfied with his bounty, or rather with his manner of di&s;tribution, had all fal|len upon him, and brui&s;ed the poor fellow unmercifully: they &s;aid the men in the ve&s;try had right to no more money than they&mdash;they drove the clerk about till he was glad to find &s;helter in the hou&s;e&mdash;I threw up the fa&s;h, to expo&s;tulate&mdash;they muttered before my face, and upon the clerk threat|ening to have them &s;et in the &s;tocks, &s;everal of the mo&s;t audacious of them, in token of defiance, broke my windows with pebble-&s;tones. About
<PB N="145" REF="152">eight o'clock in the evening another mortifying circum&s;tance fell out; for the people in the yard having &s;pent their re&s;pective modicums at the ale|hou&s;e, to the great annoyance of many &s;ober di&s;po&s;ed people of the pari&s;h, they at length fallied out in a body, and encountered the people of the ve&s;try, by whom they e&s;teemed them&s;elves robbed of their right. A war of words (as u&s;ual) began the conte&s;t&mdash;a fierce and bloody battle en|&s;ued. The farmers left their hou&s;es to &s;till the riot by authority, but they were obliged to retreat with many a broken head,&mdash;the wives and daughters came next, and abu&s;ed me for throwing away my money, and encouraging a &s;et of lazy vermin that did not <HI>belong</HI> to the pari&s;h&mdash;they &s;aid that I might be
<PB N="146" REF="153">a&s;hamed of my&s;elf for turning the &s;abbath day, into a day of drunkenne&s;s, when every good body ought to have the <HI>Te&s;tament</HI> in their hands; and concluded by ob&s;erving, that there did not u&s;e to be &s;uch goings on in their poor dead mini&s;ter's time; but indeed what better could be expected from a mad-brain harum-&s;carum bit of a <HI>boy.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>This was but a bad progno&s;tic of future felicity &mdash; I prote&s;t that I meant all for the general &s;atisfaction &mdash;twenty pounds was to be given away to the poore&s;t of the pari&s;h, and I took great pains to have the poore&s;t &s;elected and relieved&mdash;a party of unexpected nece&s;&s;itous creatures invit|ed my charity; and that no complaint of partiality might prevail either
<PB N="147" REF="154">again&s;t the memory of my guardian, or again&s;t my&s;elf, I directed an equal quantity of money to be divided among&s;t tho&s;e who were <HI>not</HI> included in the bequeathed bounty&mdash;the merce|nary part of the mob made head again&s;t me&mdash;abu&s;ed my agent, and &s;truck the gla&s;s out of my windows: in&s;tead of carrying in their hands the comforts I had given them to their pining families they &s;teal into an alehou&s;e and pour the bounty&mdash;down their throats&mdash;they next pick a quarrel with their fellow-labourers, break the &s;conces of their ma&s;ters, and then I am to bear the blame of the whole. I am always treated in this manner I think. 'Twas ju&s;t thus with me, at &s;chool.&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;ome how or another have a &s;trange method of

<Q>To be good is to be happy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="161">I was determined to try the virtue of the expre&s;&s;ion, beyond the limits of the village. I &s;et out for London, and in that city I arrived in the &s;ix|teenth year of my age, after having de&s;ired the attorney to give an eye to my affairs at the village, during my ab&s;ence&mdash;at my fir&s;t entrance into the metropolis, new &s;en&s;ations took root in my heart.

<P>&mdash;But before I proceed to &s;et down my tran&s;actions in the metro|polis, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to pa&s;s a few circum&s;tances, that fell out upon the road. The &s;ocial turn of my temper made me prefer a journey in the &s;tage, to the &s;olitary luxury of going po&s;t. I had three miles to ride to the machine, in which my fellow|pa&s;&s;engers were &s;eated &s;ive minutes before I reach'd the inn: nor did this &s;mall delay pa&s;s unnoticed by the driver, who was rubbing his hands to|gether and blowing his fingers upon account of the cold; declaring at the &s;ame time, that he had waited for me till his hor&s;es were &s;tarved to
<PB N="156" REF="163">death. Notwith&s;tanding which, he thought proper to a&s;k for &s;omething to drink my health, thereby detaining us a quarter of an hour longer; then having given the ho&s;tler his perqui&s;ite &mdash;without which he would certainly have held the coach-door in his hand, at lea&s;t another quarter of an hour&mdash; we found our&s;elves in motion. My fellow-travellers were not only muffled by the darkne&s;s of the night, but were &s;o enveloped in their great coats, that though (by the intermixture of legs) I &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf among&s;t human creatures, yet I received no other a&s;&s;urances of the matter, till (after to&s;&s;ing for about five hours,) we made a full &s;ick &s;top to refre&s;h our|&s;elves with breakfa&s;t.</P>

<P>This hou&s;e had as unfriendly an ap|pearance as ever hung out to the eye of the traveller, a &s;ignal of welcome, that is, in other words, an invitation for him to &s;pend his money. Not a creature was up, though every body knew the exact time in which the coach would come in. In a garret window indeed glimmered a malancholy can|dle, and after the coachman had &s;macked his whip about twenty times, and reinforced the reports by a pretty con&s;iderable number of oaths (peculiar to gentlemen of the whip) from that garret, with the candle between his fin|gers, came the ho&s;tler, rubbing his eyes, and crawling his way to the &s;table,
<PB N="158" REF="165">rather by in&s;tinct, than a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of knowing what he was about. About ten minutes after this the tru&s;ty chambermaid (who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was in have every thing in <HI>readine&s;s,</HI> again&s;t the arrival of the coach) came blink|ing to the door like a buzzard, and conducted us to &s;o dark, di&s;mal, and damp a room, that if we had reque&s;ted the good man of the man&s;ion for the <HI>charity</HI> of a breakfa&s;t, it would have been difficult to have depo&s;ited our mi&s;erable carca&s;es in a more un|fortable apartment.&mdash;And now it was, that my fellow pa&s;&s;engers began to convince me they were capable of moving their tongues, of which they one and all made u&s;e to expre&s;s the &s;ame complaint; viz. that it was a mo&s;t &s;hameful thing for travellers to
<PB N="159" REF="166">be treated in that manner upon the road&mdash;that if they expected a coach and &s;ix with my lord L&mdash;or my lady M&mdash;, the whole hou&s;e and &s;tables would be illuminated, and, perhaps, half the village at the wheels to gape at their honours; but that people who jumble to town in a &s;tage, and have a couple of hun|dred miles to go upon bu&s;ine&s;s, can nei|ther get &s;ire or candle in the fir&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>For my part the&s;e things were <HI>new</HI> to me, and therefore I contended my|&s;elf with begging Mrs. Betty to be&s;tir her&s;elf, and get us a di&s;h of tea as expeditiou&s;ly as &s;he could&mdash;In a little time, the faggot began to blaze&mdash;the kettle began to boil, and tho&s;e little dome&s;tic comforts made at la&s;t their appearance, which removing our di&s;|appointments,

<P>&mdash;And now we were at the top of the hill (which was indeed one of the cloud-capt kind) and the coachman de&s;ired us to get in, as the Angel was hard by, where we &s;hould have the be&s;t attendance upon the road.

The &s;ilent gentleman&mdash; for &s;uch he might be almo&s;t called&mdash; &s;aid, it was &s;ometimes hard to tell whether itinerant mendicants, merited a&s;&s;i&s;tance or not, but when a poor wretch without either limbs, or cloaths, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the eye, there could be neither doubt nor di&s;&s;i|culty in the ca&s;e&mdash;where there <HI>is</HI> doubt &s;aid I, I had rather run the ri&s;que of mi&s;placing bounty, than by not <HI>being,</HI> bountiful through a cool and political caution, and dread of being wrong&mdash;the grocer clo&s;ed the whole di&s;&s;ertation by that excellent

<P>The &s;ign of the Angel, upon which the &s;unbeams were &s;porting, now di&s;|played it&s;elf, be&s;ide the road, and the coachman (delighted with the pro&s;pect and re&s;olving to impre&s;s us with a proper idea of his dexterity) re&s;ound|ed the whip, and drove us upon the full trot up to the door. After we had &s;wallowed our meal, a fre&s;h driver ob&s;erved to us that as the road to the next &s;tage was heavy, and dragging,
<PB N="184" REF="191">and that as it was winter time&mdash;though in fact it was only the fall of the leaf &mdash;dark came upon us &s;ooner than if it was &s;ummer, he therefore hoped we would make ha&s;te. The grocer de|clared he did not like to be benighted, though he had nothing to lo&s;e even if he &s;hould be &s;topt&mdash;the quaker turned white&mdash;though his natural complexion was ro&s;y,&mdash;at the idea&mdash; the gentleman in mourning &s;aid that he was ready, and I&mdash;(holding out a gla&s;s to the driver, who to&s;&s;ed it off without any other te&s;timony of gratitude, than &s;craping a dirty boot along the floor&mdash;for which the waiter ca&s;t an evil eye at him) led the way to the machine. As &s;oon as we had got into the road, I remind|ed the grocer of his promi&s;e to oblige
<PB N="185" REF="192">us with a &s;tory. He &s;aid he was but a bad hand at that &s;ort of work, but that if we were inclined to hear the thing rough as it run, we might. I told him I &s;hould thankfully at|tend &mdash; the quaker nodded a&s;&s;ent, and the grocer after once more a&s;&s;ur|ing us he had no knack at &s;tory|telling, and that Tim Slade the exci&s;e|man was twice a match for him, thus began:</P>
<P>Why, as I was going to tell you, there was young Bob Blewitt, of our pari&s;h, as fine a &s;cholar, and as come|ly a man as you &s;hall &s;ee 'twixt this and London. He was one of your benevolent chaps. One man he put into a farm&mdash;another he &s;et up in a &s;hop; another he gave a potion to marry; and to &s;everal fatherle&s;s, and
<PB N="186" REF="193">motherle&s;s girls, he gave dowries. As to beggars, and &s;ick folk, and &s;uch like, he &s;ent them broth and broken victuals&mdash;to lying in women, (whether they had been before par&s;on or not) he &s;ent bottles of wine, and po&s;&s;ets and potecaries; and at the end of town he purcha&s;ed a piece of ground, upon which he built a bit of an ho&s;pital, which I think he called a cradle for old age, and people pa&s;t labour. In &s;hort, and to come at once to the point without running round about my &s;tory&mdash;how confoundedly the coach jolts &s;ays the grocer, and what a d&mdash;d noi&s;e it makes&mdash;I can't hear my&s;elf &mdash; the quaker bid him not be prophane&mdash;The &s;ilent gentle|man pulled up one window&mdash;I pulled up the other. The grocer went on&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="194">&mdash;In &s;hort, as I &s;aid before&mdash;whew whew&mdash;whereabouts was I?&mdash;at the ho&s;pital, &s;aid I&mdash;aye&mdash;aye, right, con|tinued the grocer&mdash;this ho&s;pital, co&s;t him a pretty round &s;um&mdash;he wanted indeed to build by &s;ub&s;cription,&mdash; no&mdash;no, &s;aid the gentry o'the neigh|bourhood, that will bring all the vagrants of the country upon us, and we have poor enough of our own, and for them we have a workhou&s;e. Mr. Blewitt &s;aid he did not mean to build a workhou&s;e, but a comfortable&mdash; &s;ylum, I think he called it&mdash;for &s;uch as can work no longer. How&s;omdever not a &s;ou&s;e could he get, only the old curate (who has five or &s;ix and twenty pounds, per year) was fool enough to give five pounds to|wards the &s;cheme&mdash;&s;o Blewitt carried
<PB N="188" REF="195">on his building alone, and cur&s;ed was the hour in which he dipped his fingers in mortar and laid the fir&s;t brick&mdash;</P>
<P>How &s;o, &s;aid I eagerly, &s;ure this was rearing for him&s;elf a monument, which a&s;cended (figuratively &s;peak|ing) into heaven&mdash;I don't know for that&mdash;but figure or no figure, ma&s;ter Bob Blewett cut but a bad figure in the end. In fine, you &s;hall &s;eldom here of &s;uch a man&mdash;ever doing &s;ommit for &s;omebody or another. The up&s;hot was, that he was teazed from morning to night with beggars and impo&s;ters, and vagabonds, and ba&s;tards&mdash;one went with a &s;orrow|ful face to beg one thing&mdash;another to beg another thing&mdash;in &s;hort every body wanted &s;omething&mdash;now
<PB N="189" REF="196">you &s;hall hear what come of this. Come of it, &s;ir, &s;aid I, what could come of it, but congratulation of heart, and univer&s;al gratitude? the quaker began to hum&mdash;the grocer &s;mil'd, and the cheek of the gentleman in mourning was wet</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;Now mind (cried the grocer), mind what tricks were played, upon the founder of the fea&s;t. The labour|ers pretended to be &s;ick that they might get food for nothing, &s;o that the farmers could not get their field|work done&mdash;many people got into trouble, purpo&s;e that he &s;hould get them out again&mdash;the young forward
<PB N="190" REF="197">hu&s;&s;eys of the pari&s;h got big-bellies, purpo&s;e that he &s;hould &s;ee the brats provided for, &s;o that this made the ju&s;tice grunt a little&mdash;he mu&s;t needs put a large parcel of money into the hands of lawyer Limbo&mdash;every body knows him&mdash;I'd as &s;oon build churches with my money, as tru&s;t he with it&mdash;well, one night, off went ma&s;ter Limbo and got beyond &s;ea&mdash;and &s;e|veral other things about the &s;ame time ran cro&s;s and crooked with poor Bob, &s;o that in &s;hort he found matters &s;adly altered.&mdash;</P>
<P>Alas? &s;aid the gentleman in black &mdash;alas? I love and pity him.</P>
<P>I wor&s;hip him, &s;aid I,&mdash;I re&s;pect him, &s;aid the quaker.</P>
<P>That's more than other folk did, rejoined the grocer. He was now
<PB N="191" REF="198">next to pennile&s;s. As &s;ure as you are alive he &s;tayed till all was gone, and his bones came well nigh through his &s;kin before he complained, and then he tried to borrow a trifle of folk he had made&mdash;not a &s;ix-penny piece could he get in the pari&s;h. At length the old curate, after a deal of per&s;ua&s;ion, prevailed on him to go and live with <HI>him,</HI> though the old fellow could &s;carely buy a neck of mutton to make &s;abbath-day broth for him&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>But GOD, &s;aid the gentleman in mourning, will make him amends yet.&mdash;He may be in heaven now for aught I know to the contrary cried the grocer&mdash;I am &s;ure of it &s;aid I&mdash; very like proceeded the grocer, for he died about &s;ix weeks after this, and put the pari&s;h to the charge of open|ing
<PB N="192" REF="199">the ground for him at la&s;t. Not a doit did he leave behind him, ex|cept a few old books, and picture, &mdash;two old fa&s;hioned blacki&s;h coats, and a bit or two of a &s;hirt; as to no|nicals he could not afford they, and &s;o he preached in &s;arplus&mdash;as &s;oon as he was buried and put into the grave which we thought Blewitt would never leave&mdash;affairs were wor&s;e than ever. Bob was as bad off as a beggar. The bettermo&s;t people lifted up their &s;houlders and gave him a bit of dinner, fir&s;t one, then another; and this they &s;ay hurt him, for at la&s;t the rich made no ceremonies, but bid him &s;tep down and get a mor&s;el in <HI>kitchen.</HI> After this&mdash;he never held up his head; the poor folks &s;aid 'twas a thou&s;and pities &s;uch a good gentleman &s;hould come to want: his kin told him 'twas ju&s;t
<PB N="193" REF="200">what they expected; his friends &s;aid he de&s;erved it, and the world at fir&s;t whi&s;pered, then openly declared that nothing but a madman, or a per&s;on never brought up to any bu&s;ine&s;s, would have acted in that manner. Here the quaker groan'd louder than ever, and holding up his hands as high as his &s;houlders, &s;hook them in a horizontal de&s;cen&s;ion, till they fell again with great method and &s;olemnity upon the flaps of his coat. The grocer began to yawn and &s;tretch him&s;elf; and where think you, conti|nued he, gaping &mdash; where is Mr. Blewitt now&mdash;why in one of the dirti|e&s;t wards in his own ho&s;pital&mdash;&s;eldom or ever &s;ees any body&mdash;now and then crawls out at dead night and goes into churchyard to vi&s;it the grave of the

<P>&mdash;How far are we come? &s;aid I ha&s;tily,&mdash;The la&s;t &s;tone, &s;aid the grocer, was &s;ixty-&s;ix&mdash;I have a great mind to go back, replied I&mdash;I would give any money to &s;ee Mr. Blewitt&mdash;how|ever I will not forget to &s;end my com|pliments to &s;o excellent a character.

<PB N="195" REF="202">aye has he, many a time, &s;aid the gro|cer. I have given him the offal of plumbs, currants, ra&s;pins of a loaf and &s;uch like.

<PB N="196" REF="203">&s;ix pence for the intere&s;t of any per&s;on in it except the concern he took in the welfare of <HI>one</HI> worthle&s;s individual,&mdash; namely&mdash;<HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Thy &s;tory, friend, &s;aid the quaker, is too exact a picture of this wicked world. I pray thee, young friend, have the fate of brother Blewitt in thy re|membrance. If thou ha&s;t abundance, take care thereof, for no man know|eth what &s;hall happen to-morrow, and I have my&s;elf &s;een, &s;trange things in my time.</P>
<P>The &s;hadows of the night now prevailed over the day, and the light of &s;ome candles at a &s;mall di&s;tance led me to &s;uppo&s;e we were pretty near our de&s;tination for the evening &mdash;however I was mi&s;taken; the lights were in a village through which we

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>At length we reached our inn, where being &s;hewn into a &s;mall but comfortable room, I propo&s;ed to order a &s;upper. The quaker declared he never eat any&mdash;that the fraility of his mortality weighed down his &s;pirit, and he found him&s;elf in|clined to &s;lumber. So &s;aying, he rang the bell for a candle, folded him&s;elf up in his &s;urtout, and in le&s;s than ten minutes forgot, I doubt not, the fate of Mr. Blewitt, and even the holding|forth which he &s;hould give before the brother and &s;i&s;ter, who became help|mates
<PB N="198" REF="205">in the fle&s;h, and yoke-fellows after God's holy ordinance. The gro|cer wi&s;hed him a good night, prote&s;t|ing neverthele&s;s, that for <HI>his</HI> part, &s;upper was his be&s;t meal; upon which declaration I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if he meant to depo&s;it more in|to his belly than he did at din|ner few people would choo&s;e to board him, at the u&s;ual rates. The gentle|man in black declined eating, but ob&s;erved it would be right to order &s;omething. I declared that I had &s;up|ped upon Mr. Blewitt. The grocer thought proper to &s;hew his&mdash;<HI>want</HI> of wit; &s;aying, (it would, he believed,) be no ea&s;y matter to make a meal out of poor Bob, as he was certain there was not an ounce of fle&s;h upon his whole carca&s;e: upon this &s;ally, (at which he
<PB N="199" REF="206">laugh'd heartily,) he applied to a bell which hung in the center of the room, and after the waiter had repeated the promi&s;e of Coming!&mdash;coming!&mdash; about ten times, he actually made his entrance, and was as pert perpendicular an appearance as could be well conceiv|ed. The grocer ordered a mo&s;t plenti|ful and &s;olid banquet, wi&s;ely con&s;idering that, as the charges were to be divided into three equal &s;hares, and as it was likely there would in reality be no great occa&s;ion for more than <HI>one</HI> knife and fork, which knife and fork would be neare&s;t to the &s;ides of his own plate, the expence, upon the whole, could not be greater to <HI>him&s;elf</HI> than if he had purcha&s;ed <HI>&s;ingly</HI> a very moderate &s;upper. While the &s;upper was dre&s;|&s;ing, I could not but take a review of the grocer, who, in&s;tead of drooping
<PB N="200" REF="207">under the fatigues of his corpulence, or the natural la&s;&s;itude which &s;ucceeds a journey, was all hope, eagerne&s;s, and expectation. He began to handle the knife, called for a whet&s;tone, tucked a towel under his chin, &s;macked his lips in echo to the cork&mdash;bad us take notice of the &s;tains in the bottle, and &s;et the wine before the fire. In this &s;ituation he &s;at and filled an elbow|chair&mdash;as fine a figure for the pencil of Hogarth, or for Reynolds (if Reynolds <HI>cho&s;e</HI> to a&s;toni&s;h in the <HI>ludicrous,</HI>) as ever pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the imagina|tion of genius. He was a &s;quat, thick, &mdash;di&s;proportioned, puffing rotundity; his face had that jolly plumpne&s;s, which buries every natural mark of meaning in grea&s;y vacuity. In the middle of that face were &s;et two eyes, which &s;wam in a &s;tupid fluid, that
<PB N="201" REF="208">&s;eemed to be a di&s;tillation from tal|low; and at the bottom was a chin which unu&s;ually broadened from the <HI>under</HI> jaw downwards; &s;o that in&s;tead of terminating in a peak, was rolled up at the bottom into a round pellet of fle&s;h under which hung tho&s;e col|lops that di&s;tingui&s;h men of his habit. The thickne&s;s of his hands were by no means proportioned to their length, nor was there any &s;pace from the ear to the &s;houlder, for a cord, had it been his fate to be elevated: &s;uch was the per&s;onage that now waddled&mdash;I will not venture to &s;ay walked into the kitchen, with a re&s;o|lution to ha&s;ten the cook, for having waited near half an hour, he declared that if he &s;tayed five minutes longer, he &s;hould out wait his appetite and then
<PB N="202" REF="209">&s;hould not be able to eat a mor&s;el&mdash;tho' he was, he mu&s;t own, va&s;tly fond of fi&s;h, loved roa&s;t fowl beyond any thing that was &s;pitted&mdash;doated upon cold ham&mdash;admired veal cutlets, had no objection to pigeon pye, and thought minced-veal very tolerable. He had not di&s;appeared more than tea mi|nutes before the kitchen was in an uproar, and the waiter came &s;kipping into the room to acquaint us that our friend would certainly be murder'd if we did not immediately carry him off. We bu&s;tled into the kitchen which now pre&s;ented a &s;cene of caricature and confu&s;ion, &s;o truly ridiculous, that it requires the pens of the immortal Fielding and Smollete to do it ju&s;tice.&mdash;It demands a chapter to it&s;elf.&mdash;</P>

<P>&mdash;The grocer was &s;tanding in his &s;hirt offering to box with the be&s;t in the place, the cook was brandi&s;hing the ba&s;ter, the landlord was threatening to de&s;troy the carca&s;e of the grocer, an half-pay officer with one arm, was clapping our ho&s;t upon the back, the hou&s;e-dog held the grocer by the breeches, and the ho&s;te&s;s was encou|raging Tiger to keep his hold. It was &s;ome time before we could learn the occa&s;ion of the fray, for the comba|tants rather grew more violent than tranquil, e&s;pecially when the grocer o&s;tentatiou&s;ly &s;wore that he could buy the whole hou&s;e, and afterwards
<PB N="204" REF="211">have more money to &s;pare than any man in company. This touched the &s;on of the &s;word, who&s;e face became immediately <HI>regimental,</HI> and march|ing up to the grocer &s;naped his fin|gers again&s;t that prominent piece of fle&s;h which nature had given him for a no&s;e; and which, unu&s;ed to that rigid and &s;oldier like &s;alutation, &s;pouted a copious &s;tream, which be|painted the prodigious breadth of linen which covered his carca&s;e. The grocer however by no means &s;ickened at the &s;ight of blood, but grew more &s;anguine in his re&s;entment, for he now da&s;hed his fi&s;ts, about like a fury,&mdash;his blows were indeed given at random, becau&s;e he was obliged to hold his head down to prevent drinking his own blood&mdash;In one of the&s;e blows it
<PB N="205" REF="212">happened, that his tremendous paw fell upon the jaws of the landlady, who catching him by the ear, over&s;et his wig, and di&s;covering a fat new|&s;horn pate, did &s;o decorate it with the crim&s;on marks of her delicate nails, that in le&s;s than three minutes, his head re&s;embled a new ploughed field, only that the &s;urrows were red in&s;tead of being earth-colour. The landlord had now an opportunity to reinforce his wife&mdash;the captain gave the word of command, Tiger roar'd out mainly in the mid&s;t, and the cook emptied the dripping-pan upon the back of the mi&s;erable grocer, who&s;e life was now &s;o critically circum&s;tanced that had not the officer by declaring the victory was completely gained, put an end to the contention, he
<PB N="206" REF="213">mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly have given up the gho&s;t. This dreadful fracas (as is often the ca&s;e) aro&s;e from a very trifling begin|ing: upon the grocer's entering the kitchen, he thought proper to a&s;&s;ume the authority of a man of very con|&s;iderable con&s;equence, and began by acquainting the cook, that though he cho&s;e to travel in a &s;tage he was not to be trifled with, as he could pay for a coach and &s;ix if he thought &s;it, adding, he believed few that travel|led the road knew better what good u&s;age was&mdash;he then found fault with the cutlets which he &s;aid were too thick, and too red&mdash;complained that the fowl was an old hen, for that her legs were as well guarded as a &s;ighting cock's, and that the fire was abun|dantly too fierce and would &s;corch
<PB N="207" REF="214">before it warmed through: upon this, he &s;allied to the &s;alt box, and was proceeding to empty the con|tents upon the coals, when the (landlady, though not an ill-tem|pered woman,) thought her pro|vince of &s;colding her own &s;er|vants &s;o cruelly invaded that &s;he de|&s;ired him, in no very gentle voice, to de&s;i&s;t; and on his refu&s;ing the reque&s;t the ho&s;t him&s;elf interpo&s;ed, till at la&s;t the grocer (recollecting how well he had &s;ecured the <HI>mainchance,</HI> and tak|ing from thence a pride of heart, which frequently emanates from a full pur&s;e,) he told the landlord he was an ill-bred &s;aucy ra&s;cal, and that he was a better man than ever &s;tood in his hou&s;e. This being a cen&s;ure that involved every one pre&s;ent, the
<PB N="208" REF="215">afore&s;aid armle&s;s officer thought him|&s;elf aggrieved, and approaching the grocer, chucked him under the chin; but unluckily the grocer's mouth being then open'd by anger, tho&s;e two ranges of bony fortification caught his tongue, till he almo&s;t &s;unk to earth with the violence of the pain. And this it was that made him di&s;robe him&s;elf and &s;tand in the po&s;ture we at fir&s;t found him; which, though heroic, was rather unfortunate, as &s;omebody, (in the hurry and heat of battle, perhaps to prevent their being made bloody,) had moved off with his &s;nuff-coloured coat, and black velvet wai&s;t coat. The engagement was how|ever at length over, and we led our champion (not indeed in triumph, but leaning upon the arm of me, and
<PB N="209" REF="216">the gentleman in mourning) into the room, with &s;uch a burle&s;que altera|tion of figure, that benevolence it&s;elf mu&s;t have &s;miled, as &s;he pitied him.</P>
<P>The idea, even of &s;upper, was now his la&s;t idea&mdash;his fir&s;t was that of water, to wa&s;h away his &s;tains; his &s;econd, was a bed to &s;oothe his brui&s;es. The landlady was now rather appea&s;|ed, and permitted the chamberlain to &s;hew the poor devil to bed, vowing however that &s;he would make him pay &s;martly for it in the morning. As &s;oon as the grocer was gone, the gentleman in mourning ob&s;erved to me, that people of low education, and little minds, were always capable of a &s;illy o&s;ten&s;ibility, that &s;ooner or later brought them into di&s;grace. Having &s;pent a few minutes more in contem|plating

Heavens! &s;aid I, what a bu&s;tle is here about an individual indeed&mdash;aye, &s;ir, replied my friend, (for &s;uch I began to wi&s;h he was) there is an invariable rule for the&s;e things&mdash;a chai&s;e and <HI>pair</HI> commands <HI>attention</HI>&mdash;a chai&s;e and <HI>four</HI> enforces <HI>homage,</HI> but a chai&s;e and <HI>&s;ix</HI> claims <HI>adoration.</HI> Nor is this obedience paid &s;o often to the per&s;on|ages within, as to the idea of the thing it&s;elf&mdash;<HI>we</HI> travel in a common &s;tage; 'tis &s;o mechanical a conveyance,
<PB N="212" REF="219">that as the waiter and landlords ex|pect little, they let us come in, and go out, as peaceably as if we were the pa&s;&s;engers of a waggon. If we were to go po&s;t we &s;hould be u&s;ed in a dif|ferent &s;tyle, and 'tis ten to one if the po&s;tilions, (who have a vanity in &s;itting before their &s;uperiors,) do not tran&s;mit a lye from one to an|other, that we are princes in-cog. &mdash;To tell you the truth (&s;aid I) I am heartily tired of my old companions, from whom I have already gained as much knowledge, as if I were to tra|vel with them to the world's end, and for once&mdash;(if you will bear me com|pany,) I will purcha&s;e a little atten|tion upon the road, by performing the re&s;t of our journey in chai&s;es. With all my heart, &s;aid the gentleman.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="220">After drinking a gla&s;s of warm wine, and having taken leave of our former fellow-travellers, we got into a neat carriage, which rolled away bri&s;kly on the road to London; but not before we had run the gaunt|let through a new &s;ett of impo&s;tors, and &s;atisfied the demands of all tho&s;e who hang round the wheels of an hackney chai&s;e. At this additional charge I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize; Be not alarmed, replied the gentleman, but think your&s;elf very well off, for if you had clapt another pair of hor&s;es to the carriage the expectations of the &s;ervants would have been rai&s;ed in proportion. Aye, and I can tell you, the per&s;on we &s;aw &s;tep out of the chai&s;e and four paid &s;omething extra, for his gold binding upon the &s;addle|cloths,
<PB N="214" REF="221">and even for the trimming upon his wai&s;tcoat&mdash;though that la&s;t circum&s;tance has lo&s;t its pri&s;tine dignity in a great degree, &s;ince our barbers, taylors, and other cra&s;ts, have of late years <HI>belaced</HI> them&s;elves from top to bottom, whenever they make an excur&s;ion into the country. Yet gold, either in or out of the pocket, will always have an influence. Then re&s;pect of this kind is really to be bought, &s;aid I&mdash;not only of this kind, rejoined the gentlemen, but of almo&s;t every other. The interchange of all ordinary civilities, is a mere verbal traffic, and as to compli|ments upon gay appearances, they are &s;o extremely <HI>marketable,</HI> that the bargain and &s;ale at Smithfield is not more in the <HI>way of bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>&mdash;Whenever the gentleman in black &s;poke, there was &s;o much &s;ere|nity and good &s;en&s;e in his remarks, &s;haded, and as it were &s;oftened by &s;ome latent anxiety, that I own my curio&s;ity was extremely excited to know more about him. His per&s;on was tall and &s;pare; his complexion extremely pale, and &s;omewhat tinged with a faint|i&s;h yellow: there was a pathetic pen&s;ive ca&s;t in his eyes, that rather denoted the languors of ince&s;&s;ant unea&s;ine&s;s, than the deadne&s;s of di&s;&s;ipation; and the ruins of a &s;mile, which ap|peared to be <HI>con&s;titutional,</HI> gave a philanthropy to his face, which de|fied the depredations of &s;orrow and time.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223">The &s;un now had ri&s;en above the clouds, and promi&s;ed us an agreeable day; and the face of nature, even in the decline of the year, appeared bright and beautiful. There are few calami|ties &s;o great, and few fates &s;o &s;evere as to leave us totally in&s;en&s;ible|to the magic of a fine morning. A warm &s;un, a clear &s;ky, the charm of vegetation,&mdash;the melody among&s;t the branches,&mdash;the refre&s;h|ment from the night's repo&s;e,&mdash;and the pro&s;pects of &s;urrounding plenty, are &s;ufficient to relax the woe of the mo&s;t <HI>melancholy</HI> traveller. Such were their force at pre&s;ent that every feature of my companion underwent a chearful alteration. He always &s;poke <HI>before</HI> in a plaintive voice, but (as he now bid me ob&s;erve how fortu|nate
<PB N="217" REF="224">we were in our weather,) there was a degree of <HI>that</HI> &s;ort of plea&s;ure in his accent, which appears to be in|&s;pired by any &s;udden &s;atisfaction of the heart. I improved this humour by turning our di&s;cour&s;e into an en|tertaining channel: and it will be &s;oon &s;een that this gentleman (who&s;e name I found to be Greaves) was ma&s;ter of every &s;ubject, had thought <HI>much</HI> and <HI>rightly,</HI> and had contem|plated every point de&s;erving contem|plation, with an accuracy, a ta&s;te, and an elegance, peculiar to men which have caught in&s;truction from le&s;&s;ons of life, a &s;ober exerci&s;e of the under&s;tand|ing, and a judicious cour&s;e of &s;tudy.</P>

<P>The &s;atisfaction, &s;ir, &s;aid I, that I feel, from our favourable weather, is much heightened by finding my&s;elf relieved from the non&s;en&s;e of my for|mer companions&mdash;pray what do you think of them?&mdash;I think of them, replied Mr. Greaves, as of men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that kind of knowledge which confers the happine&s;s &s;uited to their coar&s;e, and&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid invulnerable feelings&mdash;each is happy according to the habits of his life&mdash; they are a fre&s;h, and by no means a weak in&s;tance, of a great truth, I have long maintained, aye, and at the expence of many a warm argu|ment.</P>

<P>I &s;carce compre&mdash;Give me leave, &s;ir, &mdash;&s;aid Mr. Greaves, putting his two fore-&s;ingers lightly on my brea&s;t.

<PB N="220" REF="227">which are intended as an apology for apo&s;tacy:
<Q><L>I &s;ee too plainly, cu&s;tom forms us all:</L>
<L>Our thoughts, our morals, our mo&s;t fix'd belief,</L>

<PB N="221" REF="228">by cu&s;tom and early in&s;truc|tion.

<P>&mdash;I am quite a child, &s;ir&mdash;&s;aid I &mdash;in &s;uch &s;peculations&mdash;I cannot clearly&mdash;I will endeavour to explain my&s;elf, (rejoined the gentleman with great good-nature.) Mr. Pope ob&s;erves &mdash;that as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined. How beautiful and how ju&s;tly was it &s;aid. The colour of our future fortune greatly depends up|on a few <HI>&s;light</HI> circum&s;tances, that attend us in our nur&s;ery&mdash;exceptions you know are admitted. But pray call to mind your acquaintances&mdash; &s;ome are in bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;others are train|ed
<PB N="223" REF="230">to plea&s;ure. Suppo&s;e a child born under every favourable event of tem|poral pro&s;perity&mdash;the father is rich&mdash; the mother is beautiful: its cradle is &s;oft and downy, its pap is made of the white&s;t bread, and every accommoda|tion that the little &s;tranger demands, is in the highe&s;t perfection&mdash;It will not be long before the&s;e <HI>&s;oftne&s;&s;es</HI> will have &s;o great an influence upon the body, that the infant will imbibe from the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, an idea of luxury&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e on the other hand a child which is the offspring of laborious and indi|gent parents&mdash;its birth is effected upon the &s;traw, or on &s;acking without cur|tains, the wind blowing hard through the ca&s;ement&mdash;the mother lies down contented with her &s;mall beer caudle, and on the third or fourth day, &s;he is
<PB N="224" REF="231">up, and dandling the babe upon het knee, or dancing it in her arms&mdash;about the time that the <HI>rich</HI> child begins to know the delicacy of its condition, he <HI>poor</HI> one would find it&s;elf promi&s;ing and hardy, and in &s;ome degree i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed to the &s;torms of life&mdash;let them he at this period each five years old; the one has acquired a &s;en&s;ation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the other an habit of hardihood&mdash;&s;up|po&s;e then, about this time, it were po&s;&s;i|ble for them to change &s;ituations. The pennyle&s;s lad &s;hall go into the warm villa&mdash;the rich &s;tripling into the cold cottage&mdash;what would be the con&s;equence? exactly the &s;ame as if the two <HI>mothers</HI> and <HI>fathers</HI> &s;hould exchange. All would be di&s;tre&s;s, dilemma, confu&s;ion, and aukward|ne&s;s&mdash;the pampered youth would
<PB N="225" REF="232">croud over the wretched bit of a blaze made by two &s;ticks, laid acro&s;s a brick, and the lad who was bred in a tem|pe&s;t, and &s;ea&s;oned to wind and wea|ther, would very probably to&s;s his play|thing again&s;t the fine &s;a&s;h-window to let in the air, and prevent &s;uffoca|tion. Thus far I have &s;poken with re&s;pect to the influence of early habits upon the body. Let us now &s;ee what effect they have upon the mind. The connexion betwixt our mortal and immortal part, is far clo&s;er than be|twixt man and wife. Nothing can befal the one that is indifferent to the other: &s;ympathy implanted by na|ture is univer&s;ally reciprocated, and the tie is at once tender, and forci|ble.
<PB N="226" REF="233">Con&s;equently the minds of tho&s;e two boys, mu&s;t be affected very &s;en&s;ibly by their re&s;pective educations and cu&s;toms. As they grow up tho&s;e cu&s;toms will &s;o &s;trengthen, that no|thing but "death or heaven" can reconcile them to an innovation, either in thought, word, or deed. The <HI>poor</HI> boy, having heard nothing but unpoli&s;hed language, eat no|thing but coar&s;e food, and pa&s;&s;ed his day among&s;t clowns, and cat|tle, will for ever continue in the track, and if by any <HI>unlucky</HI> &s;troke of chance, he is called to new pur&s;uits, his mi&s;ery mu&s;t be dated from the day in which he de&s;erted the &s;pade, the plough&s;hare, or the flail. The <HI>rich</HI> boy in the mean time ri&s;es into
<PB N="227" REF="234">man, amid&s;t the cla&s;h of carriages, the comfort of couches, and the luxuries of lazine&s;s. His ears are ac|cu&s;tomed to mu&s;ic, flattery, and fa&s;h|ion; and his eyes are daily charm|ed with objects of di&s;&s;ipation or de|light. No po&s;&s;ible accident could be more fatal to his peace, than a &s;udden deprivation of the&s;e plea&s;ures. Take him again into the hut, like a fi&s;h upon land, he finds him&s;elf in&s;tantly out of his element: the greate&s;t tran&s;ports of the pea&s;ant, are agony to him, and every thing around, and within him, is as &s;trange as if he had &s;tept into a new world. Why is all this?&mdash;merely becau&s;e they have been taught to think, and feel and act differently&mdash;on the other hand&mdash;but I
<PB N="228" REF="235">mu&s;t tire you, fir&mdash;I am concerned; returned I, Mr. Greaves &s;hould think an apology nece&s;&s;ary for be&s;towing upon me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure upon earth.&mdash;Mr. Greaves pau&s;ed a little, bowed and proceed|ed.</P>
