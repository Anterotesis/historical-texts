<HEAD>THE Hi&s;tory and Adventures OF AN ATOM.</HEAD>
<P>THE time was now come when Fortune, which had hitherto &s;miled upon the Chine&s;e arms, re&s;olved to turn tail to that vain-glorious nation; and preci&s;ely at the &s;ame in&s;tant Taycho undertook to di&s;play his whole ca|pacity in the management of the war. But before he a&s;&s;umed this province, it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a de&s;poti&s;m in the council of Twenty-eight, &s;ome mem|bers of which had &s;till the pre&s;ump|tion to offer their advice towards the;
<PB N="2" REF="3">
admini&s;tration of affairs. This coun|cil being a&s;&s;embled by the Dairo's order, to deliberate upon the objects of the next campaign, the pre&s;i|dent began by a&s;king the opinion of Taycho, who was the younge&s;t mem|ber; upon which the orator made no articulate reply, but cried <Q REND="inline">"Ba-ba-ba-ba!"</Q> The Dairo exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Boh!"</Q> The Fatzman ejaculated the interjection <Q REND="inline">"Pi&s;h!"</Q> The Cu|boy &s;at in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment. Gotto|mio &s;wore the man was dumb, and hinted &s;omething of lunacy. Fok|&s;i-rokhu &s;hook his head; and Soo|&s;an-&s;in-o &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders. At length, Fika-kaka going round and ki&s;&s;ing Taycho on the forehead, <Q REND="inline">"My dear boy (cried he)!&mdash;Gad's cur&s;e! what's the matter? Do but open the &s;luices of your elo|quence once more, my dear orator;&mdash;let us have one &s;imile&mdash;one dear &s;imile; and then I &s;hall die con|tented.
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&mdash;With re&s;pect to the opera|tions of the campaign, don't you think"</Q>&mdash;Here he was interrupted with <Q REND="inline">"Ka, ka, ka, ka!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Heigh|day!" (cried the Cuboy) Ba-ba-ba, ka-ka-ka! that's the language of children!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And children you &s;hall be (exclaimed the orator). Here is a two-penny trumpet for the amu&s;ement of the illu&s;trious Got-hama-baba; a &s;word of ginger|bread covered with gold-leaf for the Fatzman; and a rattle for my lord Cuboy. I have, likewi&s;e, &s;ugar|plumbs for the re&s;t of the council."</Q> So &s;aying, he, without ceremony, advanced to the Dairo, and tied a &s;carf round the eyes of his imperial maje&s;ty: then he produced a num|ber of padlocks, and &s;ealed up the lips of every Quo in council, before they could recollect them&s;elves from their fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. The a&s;&s;em|bly broke up abruptly; and the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Dairo was conducted to his cabinet by the Fatzman and the Cuboy, which la&s;t endeavoured to divert the chagrin of his royal ma&s;ter, by blow|ing the trumpet and &s;haking the rat|tle in his ears: but Got-hama-ba-ba could not be &s;o ea&s;ily appea&s;ed. He growled like an enraged bear, at the indignity which had been offer|ed to him, and kicked the Cuboy before as well as behind. Mr. Ora|tor Taycho was fain to come to an explanation. He a&s;&s;ured the Dairo, it was nece&s;&s;ary that his impe|rial maje&s;ty &s;hould remain in the dark, and that the whole council &s;hould be muzzled for a &s;ea&s;on, otherwi&s;e he could not accompli&s;h the great things he had projected in favour of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o. He declared, that while his maje&s;ty re|mained blindfold, he would enjoy all his other &s;en&s;es in greater perfec|tion; that his ears would be every
<PB N="5" REF="6">
day regaled with the &s;houts of tri|umph, conveyed in notes of uncom|mon melody; and that the le&s;s quan|tity of animal &s;pirits was expended in vi&s;ion, the greater proportion would flow to his extremities; con|&s;equently, his plea&s;ure would be more acute in his pede&s;trian exerci|tations upon the Cuboy and others whom he delighted to honour. He, therefore, exhorted him to undergo a total privation of eye-&s;ight, which was at be&s;t a trouble&s;ome faculty, that expo&s;ed mankind to a great va|riety of di&s;agreeable &s;pectacles. This was a propo&s;al which the Dairo did not reli&s;h: on the contrary, he waxed exceedingly wroth, and told the orator he would rather enjoy one tran&s;ient glance of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o, than the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delights that could be procured for all the other &s;en&s;es. <Q REND="inline">"To gratify your maje&s;ty with that ineffable plea&s;ure, (cried
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Taycho) I have devoted my&s;elf, &s;oul and body, and even reconciled con|tradictions. I have renounced all my former principles without for|feiting the influence which, by pro|fe&s;&s;ing tho&s;e principles, I had gain|ed. I have obtained the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing victories over common &s;en&s;e, and even refuted mathematical de|mon&s;tration. The many-headed Mob, which no former demagogue could ever tame, I have taught to fetch and to carry; to dance to my pipe; to bray to my tune; to &s;wallow what I pre&s;ent without murmuring; to lick my feet when I am angry; and ki&s;s the rod when I think proper to cha&s;ti&s;e it. I have done more, my liege; I have prepared a drench for it, which, like Lethe, wa&s;hes away the remembrance of what is pa&s;t, and takes away all &s;en&s;e of its own con|dition. I have &s;wept away all the money of the empire; and per&s;uad|ed
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the people not only to beggar them&s;elves, but likewi&s;e to entail in|digence upon their late&s;t po&s;terity; and all for the &s;ake of Ye&s;&s;o. It is by dint of the&s;e efforts I have been able to &s;ub&s;idize Brut-an-tiffi, and rai&s;e an army of one hundred thou|&s;and men to defend your imperial maje&s;ty's farm, which, were the en|tire property of it brought to mar|ket, would not fetch one-third part of the &s;ums which are now yearly expended in its defence. I &s;hall &s;trike but one great &s;troke in the country of Fat&s;i&s;io, and then turn the whole &s;tream of the war into the channel of Tartary, until the barren plains of Ye&s;&s;o are fertilized with human blood. In the mean time, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon your ma|je&s;ty's continuing in the dark, and amu&s;ing your&s;elf in your cabinet with the trumpet and other gew|gaws which I have provided for your
<PB N="8" REF="9">
diver&s;ion; otherwi&s;e I quit the reins of admini&s;tration, and turn the mon|&s;ter out of my trammels; in which ca&s;e, like the dog that returns to its vomit, it will not fail to take up its former prejudices again&s;t Ye&s;&s;o, which I have with &s;uch pains obliged it to re&s;ign."&mdash;"O my dear Taycho! (cried the affrighted Dairo) talk not of leaving me in &s;uch a dreadful di|lemma. Rather than the dear farm &s;hould fall into the hands of the Chine&s;e, I would be contented to be led about blindfold all the days of my life.&mdash;Proceed in your own way.&mdash;I inve&s;t you with full power and authority, not only to gag my whole council, but even to nail their ears to the pillory, &s;hould it be found nece&s;|&s;ary for the benefit of Ye&s;&s;o. In token of which delegation, pre&s;ent your po&s;|teriors, and I will be&s;tow upon you a double portion of my favour."</Q> Tay|cho humbly thanked his imperial
<PB N="9" REF="10">
maje&s;ty for the great honour he in|tended him; but begged leave to decline the ceremony, on account of the haemorrhoids, which at that time gave him great di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The orator having thus annihilated all oppo&s;ition in the council of Twenty-eight, repaired to his own hou&s;e, in order to plan the opera|tions of the en&s;uing campaign. Tho' he had reinforced the army in Tar|tary with the flower of the Japone&s;e &s;oldiery, and de&s;tined a &s;trong &s;qua|dron of Fune, as u&s;ual, to parade on the coa&s;t of China; he fore&s;aw it would be nece&s;&s;ary to amu&s;e the people with &s;ome new &s;troke on the &s;ide of Fat&s;i&s;io, which indeed was the original, and the mo&s;t natural &s;cene of the war. He locked him&s;elf up in his clo&s;et, and in con&s;ulting the map of Fat&s;i&s;io, he found that the principal Chine&s;e &s;ettlement of that
<PB N="10" REF="11">
i&s;land, was a fortified town called Quib-quab, to which there was acce&s;s by two different avenues; one by a broad, rapid, navigable river, on the banks of which the town was &s;ituated; and the other by an inland route over mountains, lakes, and dangerous torrents. He mea&s;ured the map with his compa&s;s, and per|ceived that both routes were nearly of the &s;ame length; and therefore he re&s;olved that the forces in Fat&s;i&s;io, being divided into two equal bodies, &s;hould approach the place by the two different avenues, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would both arrive before the walls of Quib-quab at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time. The conduct of the inland expedition was given to Yaff|ray, who now commanded in chief in Fat&s;i&s;io; and the re&s;t of the troops were &s;ent up the great river, under the au&s;pices of Ya-loff, who had &s;o
<PB N="11" REF="12">
eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the cour&s;e of the preceding year.</P>
<P>Orator Taycho had received &s;ome articles of intelligence which em|barra&s;&s;ed him a little at fir&s;t; but the&s;e difficulties &s;oon vani&s;hed before the vigour of his re&s;olutions. He knew, that not only the town of Quib-quab was fortified by art, but al&s;o, that the whole adjacent coun|try was almo&s;t impregnable by na|ture: that one Chine&s;e general block|ed up the pa&s;&s;es with a &s;trong body of forces, in the route which was to be followed by Yaff-rai; and that another commanded a &s;eparate corps in the neighbourhood of Quib-quab, equal, at lea&s;t, in number to the de|tachment of Ya-loff, whom he might therefore either prevent from land|ing, or attack after he &s;hould be landed: or finally, &s;hould neither of the&s;e attempts &s;ucceed, he might re|inforce the garri&s;on of Quib-quab,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;o as to make it more numerous than the be&s;ieging army, which, accord|ing to the rules of war, ought to be ten times the number of the be&s;ieged. On the other hand, in order to inva|lidate the&s;e objections, he reflected that Fortune, which hath &s;uch a &s;hare in all military events, is incon&s;tant and variable; that as the Chine&s;e had been &s;o long &s;ucce&s;sful in Fat&s;i&s;io, it was now their turn to be unfortunate. He reflected that the daemon of folly was capricious; and that as it had &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the rulers and gene|rals of Japan, it was high time it &s;hould &s;hift its quarters, and occupy the brains of the enemy; in which ca&s;e they would quit their advan|tageous po&s;ts, and commit &s;ome blunder that would lay them at the mercy of the Japone&s;e.&mdash;With re|&s;pect to the reduction of Quib-quab, he had heard, indeed, that the be|&s;iegers ought to be ten times the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
number of the garri&s;on be&s;ieged; but as every Japone&s;e was equivalent to ten &s;ubjects of China, he thought the match was pretty equal. He re|flected, that even if this expedition &s;hould not &s;ucceed, it would be of little con&s;equence to his reputation, as he could plead at home, that he neither conceived the original plan, nor appointed any of the officers concerned in the execution. It is true, he might have reinforced the army in Fat&s;i&s;io, &s;o as to leave very little to Fortune: but then he mu&s;t have &s;ub&s;tracted &s;omething from the &s;trength of the operations in Tar|tary, which was now become the favourite &s;cene of the war; or he mu&s;t have altogether &s;u&s;pended the execution of another darling &s;cheme, which was literally his own concep|tion. There was an i&s;land in the great Indian ocean, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from Fat&s;i&s;io; and here the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Chine&s;e had a &s;trong &s;ettlement. Taycho was inflamed with the am|bition of reducing this i&s;land, which was called Thin-quo; and for this purpo&s;e he re&s;olved to embark a body of forces which &s;hould co-operate with the &s;quadron of Fune de&s;tined to cruize in tho&s;e latitudes.&mdash;The only difficulty that remained was to choo&s;e a general to direct this enter|prize.&mdash;He peru&s;ed a li&s;t of all the military officers in Japan; and as they were all equal in point of repu|tation, he began to examine their names, in order to pitch upon that which &s;hould appear to be the mo&s;t &s;ignificant: and in this particular, Taycho was a little &s;uper&s;titious. Not but that &s;urnames, when pro|perly be&s;towed, might be rendered very u&s;eful terms of di&s;tinction: but I mu&s;t tell thee, Peacock, no|thing can be more prepo&s;terou&s;ly ab&s;urd than the practice of inheriting
<PB N="15" REF="16">
<HI>cognomina,</HI> which ought ever to be purely per&s;onal. I would a&s;k thee, for example, what propriety there was in giving the name <HI>Xenophon,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>one that &s;peaks a fo|reign language,</HI> to the celebrated Greek who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, not only as a con&s;ummate captain, but al&s;o as an elegant writer in his mother-tongue? What could be more ridiculous than to deno|minate the great philo&s;opher of Crotona <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> which implies a <HI>&s;tinking &s;peech?</HI> Or what could be more mi&s;applied than the name of the weeping philo&s;opher <HI>Hera|clitus,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>military glory?</HI> The inheritance of &s;urnames, among the Romans, produced &s;till more ludi|crous con&s;equences. The be&s;t and noble&s;t families in Rome derived their names from the coar&s;e&s;t em|ployments, or el&s;e from the corpo|real blemi&s;hes of their ance&s;tors.
<PB N="16" REF="17">
The <HI>Pi&s;ones</HI> were millers: the <HI>Cice|rones</HI> and the <HI>Lentuli</HI> were &s;o called from the <HI>vetches</HI> and the <HI>lentils</HI> which their forefathers dealt in. The <HI>Fabij</HI> were &s;o denominated from a dung-pit, in which the fir&s;t of the family was begot by &s;tealth in the way of forni|cation. A ploughman gave ri&s;e to the great family of the <HI>Serrani,</HI> the ladies of which always went without &s;mocks. The <HI>Suilli,</HI> the <HI>Bubulci,</HI> and the <HI>Porci,</HI> were de&s;cended from a &s;wine-herd, a cow-herd, and a hog|butcher.&mdash;What could be more di&s;|graceful than to call the &s;enator <HI>Strabo, Squintum;</HI> or a fine young lady of the hou&s;e of <HI>Poeti, Pig&s;nies?</HI> or to di&s;tingui&s;h a matron of the <HI>Li|mi,</HI> by the appellation of <HI>Sheep's-eye?</HI>&mdash;What could be more di&s;ho|nourable than to give the &s;urname of <HI>Snub-no&s;e</HI> to <HI>P. Silius,</HI> the pro|praetor, becau&s;e his great-great-great-grand-father had a no&s;e of that

Ovid, indeed, had a long no&s;e, and therefore was ju&s;tly de|nominated <HI>Na&s;o:</HI> but why &s;hould Horace be called <HI>Flaccus,</HI> as if his ears had been &s;tretched in the pil|lory: I need not mention the <HI>Bur|rhi, Nigri, Ru&s;i, Aquilij,</HI> and <HI>Rutilij,</HI> becau&s;e we have the &s;ame fooli&s;h &s;urnames in England; and even the <HI>Lappa;</HI> for I my&s;elf know a very pretty mi&s;s called <HI>Rough-head,</HI> tho' in fact there is not a young lady in the Bills of Mortality, who takes more pains to dre&s;s her hair to the be&s;t ad|vantage. The famous dictator whom the deputies of Rome found at the plough, was known by the name of <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> or <HI>Ragged-head.</HI> Now I leave you to judge how it would found in the&s;e days, if a footman at the play-hou&s;e &s;hould call out, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>My Lady Ragged-head's coach.

But I cannot help taking notice of &s;ome of the &s;ame improprieties, which have crept into the language and cu&s;toms of this country.

Richard had, undoubtedly, one &s;houlder higher than the other, and his left arm was a little &s;hrunk and contracted: but, notwith&s;tanding the ungracious colours in which he has been drawn by the flatterers of the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter, I can a&s;&s;ure thee, Peacock, that Richard was a prince of a very agree|able a&s;pect, and excelled in every per&s;onal accompli&s;hment; neither was his heart a &s;tranger to the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and pity. The very night that preceded the fatal battle of Bo&s;worth, in which he lo&s;t his life, he went in di&s;gui&s;e to the hou&s;e of a farmer in the neighbourhood, to vi&s;it an infant &s;on there boarded, who was the fruit of an amour between him and a young lady of the fir&s;t condition.

After the ca|ta&s;trophe of Richard this hou&s;e was plundered, and the nur&s;e with diffi|culty e&s;caped to another part of the country; but as the enemies of Rich|ard now prevailed, &s;he never dur&s;t reveal the &s;ecret of the boy's birth; and he was bred up as her own &s;on to the trade of brick-laying, in which character he lived and died in an ad|vanced age at London.&mdash;Moreover, it is but ju&s;tice in me, who con&s;tituted part of one of Richard's yeomen of the guard, to a&s;&s;ure thee that this prince was not &s;o wicked and cruel as he has been repre&s;ented.

time to return to the thread of our narration. Taycho, having con&s;ider|ed the li&s;t of officers, without finding one name which implied any active virtue, re&s;olved that the choice &s;hould depend upon accident. He hu&s;tled them all together in his cap, and putting in his hand at random, drew forth that of Hob-nob; a per&s;on who had grown old in ob&s;curity, without ever having found an opportunity of being concerned in actual &s;ervice. His very name was utterly unknown to Fika-kaka; and this circum&s;tance the orator con&s;idered as a lucky omen; for the Cuboy had &s;uch a remarkable knack at finding out the lea&s;t qualified &s;ubjects, and overlook|ing merit, his new collegue concluded (not without &s;ome &s;hadow of rea&s;on) that Hob-nob's being unknown to the prime mini&s;ter, was a &s;ort of ne|gative pre&s;umption in favour of his character. This officer was accord|ingly
<PB N="28" REF="29">
placed at the head of an ar|mament, and &s;ent again&s;t the i&s;land of Thin-quo, in the conque&s;t of which he was to be &s;upported by a &s;quadron of Fune already in tho&s;e latitudes, under the command of the chief He-Rhumn.</P>
<P>The voyage was performed without lo&s;s: the troops were landed without oppo&s;ition. They had already ad|vanced towards a ri&s;ing-ground which commanded the principal town of the i&s;land, and He-Rhumn had of|fered to land and draw the artillery by the mariners of his &s;quadron, when Hob-nob had a dream which di&s;con|certed all his mea&s;ures. He dream|ed that he entertained all the i&s;land|ers in the temple of the White Hor&s;e; and that his own grand-mother did the honours of the table.&mdash;Indeed he could not have performed a greater act of charity; for they were literal|ly in danger of peri&s;hing by famine.
<PB N="29" REF="30">
Having con&s;ulted his interpreter on this extraordinary dream, he was gi|ven to under&s;tand that the omen was unlucky; that if he per&s;i&s;ted in his ho&s;tilities, he him&s;elf would be taken pri&s;oner, and offered up as a &s;acrifice to the idol of the place. While he ruminated on this unfavourable re|&s;pon&s;e, the principal inhabitants of the i&s;land a&s;&s;embled, in order to de|liberate upon their own deplorable &s;ituation. They had neither troops, arms, fortifications, nor provi&s;ion, and de&s;paired of &s;upplies, as the fleet of Japan &s;urrounded the i&s;land. In this emergency, they determined to &s;ubmit without oppo&s;ition; and appointed a deputation to go and make a tender of the i&s;land to ge|neral Hob-nob. This deputation, preceded by white flags of truce, the Japone&s;e commander no &s;ooner de&s;|cried, than he thought upon the in|terpretation of his dream. He mi&s;|took
<PB N="30" REF="31">
the deputies with their white flags for the Bonzas of the idol to which he was to be &s;acrificed; and, being &s;orely troubled in mind, order|ed the troops to be immediately re|imbarked, notwith&s;tanding the ex|hortations of He-Rhumn, and the remon&s;trances of Rha-rin-tumm, the &s;econd in command, who u&s;ed a number of arguments to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e. The deputies &s;eeing the enemy in motion, made a halt, and, after they were fair|ly on board, returned to the town, &s;inging hymns in prai&s;e of the idol Fo, who, they imagined, had con|founded the under&s;tanding of the Ja|pone&s;e general.</P>
<P>The attempt upon Thin-quo hav|ing thus mi&s;carried, Hob-nob declar|ed he would return to Japan; but was with great difficulty per&s;uaded by the commander of the Fune and his own &s;econd, to make a de&s;cent
<PB N="31" REF="32">
upon another i&s;land belonging to the Chine&s;e, called <HI>Qua-chu,</HI> where they a&s;&s;ured him he would meet with no oppo&s;ition. As he had no dream to deter him from this attempt, he &s;uf|fered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded, and actually made good his landing: but the horror occa&s;ioned by the appari|tion of his grand-mother, had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind, as affected the con&s;titution of his body. Before he was vi&s;ited by an|other &s;uch vi&s;ion, he &s;ickened and died; and in con&s;equence of his death, Rha-rin-tumm and He-Rhumn made a conque&s;t of the i&s;land of Qua-Chu, which was much more valu|able than Thin-quo, the fir&s;t and &s;ole object of the expedition.&mdash;When the fir&s;t news of this &s;econd de&s;cent ar|rived in Japan, the mini&s;try were in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. Mr. Orator Taycho did not &s;cruple to declare

that general Hobnob had mi&s;behav|ed; fir&s;t, in relinqui&s;hing Thin-quo, upon &s;uch a frivolous-pretence as the &s;uppo&s;ed apparition of an old wo|man; &s;econdly, in attempting the conque&s;t of another place, which was not &s;o much as mentioned in his in&s;tructions. The truth is, the importance of Qua-chu was not known to the cabinet of Japan. Fika-kaka believed it was &s;ome place on the continent of Tartary, and ex|claimed in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Rot the block-head, Hob-nob; he'll have an army of Chine&s;e on his back in a twinkling!"</Q> When the pre&s;ident Soo-&s;an-&s;in-o a&s;&s;ured him that Qua-chu was a rich i&s;land at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from the continent of Tar|tary, the Cuboy in&s;i&s;ted upon ki&s;&s;ing his excellency's po&s;teriors for the agreeable information he had recei|ved. In a few weeks arrived the

tidings of the i&s;land's being totally reduced by Rha-rin-tumm and He-Rhumn.&mdash;Then the conque&s;t was publi&s;hed throughout the empire of Japan with every circum&s;tance of ex|aggeration. The blatant bea&s;t bray|ed applau&s;e. The rites of Fakku|ba&s;i were celebrated with unu|&s;ual &s;olemnity; and hymns of tri|umph were &s;ung to the glory of the great Taycho. Even the Cuboy ar|rogated to him&s;elf &s;ome &s;hare of the honour gained by this expedi|tion; ina&s;much as the general Rha-rin-tumm was the brother of his friend Mr. Secretary <HI>No-bo-dy.</HI> Fi|ka-kaka gave a grand entertainment at his palace, where he appeared crowned with a garland of the <HI>T&s;ikk|bura&s;iba,</HI> or laurel of Japan; and eat &s;o much of the &s;oup of <HI>Joniku</HI> or famous <HI>Swallow's-ne&s;t,</HI> that he was for three days troubled with flatulencies and indige&s;tion.</P>

In the mid&s;t of all this fe&s;tivity, the emperor &s;till growled and grum|bled about Ye&s;&s;o. His new ally Brut-an-tiffi had met with a variety of fortune, and even &s;uffered &s;ome &s;hocks, which orator Taycho, with all his art, could not keep from the knowledge of the Dairo.&mdash;He had been &s;everely drubbed by the Mant-choux, who had advanced for that purpo&s;e even to his court-yard: but this was nothing in compari&s;on to another di&s;a&s;ter, from which he had a hair-breadth '&s;cape. The Great Khan had employed one of his mo&s;t wily and enterpri&s;ing chiefs to &s;eize Brut-an-tiffi by &s;urprize, that he might be brought to ju&s;tice, and ex|ecuted as a felon and perturbator of the public peace. Kunt-than, who was the parti&s;an pitched upon for this &s;ervice, practi&s;ed a thou&s;and &s;trata|gems to decoy Brut-an-tiffi into a carele&s;s &s;ecurity; but he was &s;till
<PB N="35" REF="36">
baffled by the vigilance of Yam-a-Kheit, a famous &s;oldier of fortune, who had engaged in the &s;ervice of the outlawed Tartar. At length the opportunity offered, when this cap|tain was &s;ent out to lay the country under contribution. Then Kunt-than marching &s;olely in the dead of night, caught Brut-an-tiffi napping. He might have &s;lain him upon the &s;pot; but his orders were to take him alive, that he might be made a public ex|ample; accordingly, his centinels be|ing di&s;patched, he was pulled out of bed, and his hands were already tied with cords, like tho&s;e of a common malefactor, when, by his roaring and bellowing, he gave the alarm to Yam-a-Kheit, who chanced to be in the neighbourhood, returning from his excur&s;ion.&mdash;He made all the ha&s;te he could, and came up in the very nick of time to &s;ave his ma&s;ter. He fell upon the party of Kunt-than
<PB N="36" REF="37">
with &s;uch fury, that they were fain to quit their prey: then he cut the fetters of Brut-an-tiffi, who took to his heels and fled with incredible expedition, leaving his pre&s;erver in the mid&s;t of his enemies, by whom he was overpowered, &s;truck from his hor&s;e, and trampled to death. The grateful Tartar not only de&s;ert|ed this brave captain in &s;uch extre|mity, but he al&s;o took care to a&s;|per&s;e his memory, by in&s;inuating that Yam-a-Kheit had undertaken to watch him while he took his repo&s;e, and had him&s;elf fallen a&s;leep upon his po&s;t, by which neglect of duty the O&s;trog had been enabled to pe|netrate into his quarters. 'Tis an ill wind that blows no-body good:&mdash;the &s;ame di&s;a&s;ter that deprived him of a good officer, afforded him an opportunity to &s;hift the blame of ne|glect from his own &s;houlders to tho&s;e of a per&s;on who could not an&s;wer for

him&s;elf.&mdash;In the &s;ame manner, your general A&mdash;y acquitted him&s;elf of the charge of mi&s;conduct for the at|tack of T&mdash;a, by accu&s;ing his engineer, who, having fallen in the battle, could not contradict his a&s;|&s;ertion. In regard to the affair with the Mantchoux, Brut-an-tiffi was re&s;olved to &s;wear truth out of Tar|tary by meer dint of impudence. In the very article of running away, he began to propagate the report of the great victory he had obtained. He &s;ent the Dairo a circum&s;tantial detail of his own prowe&s;s, and ex|patiated upon the cowardice of the Mantchoux, who he &s;aid had vani&s;h|ed from him like quick-&s;ilver, at the very time when they were quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the field of battle, and he him&s;elf was calling upon the moun|tains to cover him. It mu&s;t have been in imitation of this great origi|nal, that the In&s;pector, of tympani|tical
<PB N="38" REF="39">
memory, a&s;&s;ured the public in one of his lucubrations, that a cer|tain tall Hibernian was afraid of looking him in the face; becau&s;e the &s;aid poltroon had kicked his breech the night before in pre&s;ence of five hundred people.</P>
<P>Fortune had now abandoned the Chine&s;e in good earne&s;t. Two &s;quadrons of their Fune had been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively taken, de&s;troyed, or di&s;|per&s;ed, by the Japone&s;e commanders Or-nbos and Fa&s;-khan; and they had lo&s;t &s;uch a number of &s;ingle junks, that they were &s;carce able to keep the &s;ea. On the coa&s;t of Africa they were driven from the &s;ettle|ment of Kho-rh&eacute;, by the com|mander Kha-fell. In the extremity of A&s;ia, they had an army totally defeated by the Japone&s;e captain Khutt-whang, and many of their &s;ettlements were taken. In Fat|&s;i&s;io, they lo&s;t another battle to
<PB N="39" REF="40">
Yan-oni, and divers &s;trong holds. In the neighbourhood of Ye&s;&s;o, Bron|xi-tic, who commanded the merce|nary army of Japan on that conti|nent, had been obliged to retreat before the Chine&s;e from po&s;t to pil|lar, till at length he found it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain his po|&s;ition, even at the ri&s;que of being at|tacked by the enemy, that outnum|bered him greatly. He cho&s;e an advantageous po&s;t, where he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure, and went to &s;leep at his u&s;ual time of re&s;t. The Chi|ne&s;e-general re&s;olving to beat up his quarters in the night, &s;elected a body of hor&s;e for that purpo&s;e, and put them in motion accordingly. It was happy for Bron-xi-tic that this detachment fell upon a quarter where there happened to be a kennel of Japone&s;e dogs, which are as famous as the bull-dogs of England. The&s;e animals, ever on the watch, not only
<PB N="40" REF="41">
gave the alarm, but at the &s;ame time fell upon the Chine&s;e hor&s;es with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the ene|my were di&s;ordered, and had actu|ally fled before Bron-xi-tic could bring up his troops to action. All that he &s;aw of the battle, when he came up, was a &s;mall number of killed and wounded, and the cavalry of the enemy &s;campering off in con|fu&s;ion, tho' at a great di&s;tance from the field. No matter;&mdash;he found means to paint this famous battle of Myn-than in &s;uch colours as dazzled the weak eye-&s;ight of the Japone&s;e mon&s;ter, which bellowed hoar&s;e ap|plau&s;e through all its throats; and in its hymns of triumph equalled Bron-xi-tic even to the unconquer|able Brut-an-tiffi, which la&s;t, about this time, received at his own door another beating from the Mant|choux, &s;o &s;evere that he lay for &s;ome time without exhibiting any &s;igns of
<PB N="41" REF="42">
life; and, indeed, owed his &s;afety to a very extraordinary circum&s;tance. An O&s;trog chief called Llha-dahn, who had reinforced the Mantchoux with a very con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e before the battle, in&s;i&s;ted up|on carrying off the carca&s;e of Brut-an-tiffi, that it might be hung up on a gibbet <HI>in terrorem,</HI> before the pa|vilion of the great Khan. The general of the Mantchoux, on the other hand, declared he would have it flayed upon the &s;pot, and the &s;kin &s;ent as a trophy to his &s;overeign. This di&s;pute produced a great deal of abu&s;e betwixt tho&s;e barbarians; and it was with great difficulty &s;ome of their inferior chiefs, who were wi&s;er than them&s;elves, prevented them from going by the ears to|gether. In a word, the confu|&s;ion and anarchy that en&s;ued, afford|ed an opportunity to one of Brut-an-tiffi's parti&s;ans to &s;teal away the
<PB N="42" REF="43">
body of his ma&s;ter, whom the noi&s;e of the conte&s;t had ju&s;t rou&s;ed from his &s;woon. Llha-dahn perceiving he was gone, rode off in di&s;gu&s;t with all his cavalry; and the Mantchoux, in&s;tead of following the blow, made a retrograde motion towards their own country, which allowed Brut-an-tiffi time to breathe. Three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;a&s;ters of this kind would have been &s;ufficient to lower the military character of any warrior, in the opi|nion of any public that judged from their own &s;en&s;es and reflexion: but, by this time, the Japone&s;e had quiet|ly re&s;igned all their natural percep|tions, and paid the mo&s;t implicit faith to every article broached by their apo&s;tle Taycho. The more it &s;eemed to contradict common rea|&s;on and common evidence, the more greedily was it &s;wallowed as a my&s;|terious dogma of the political creed. Taycho then a&s;&s;ured them that the
<PB N="43" REF="44">
whole army of the Mantchoux was put to the &s;word; and that Bron-xi-tic would carry the war within three weeks, into the heart of Chi|na; he gave them goblets of hor&s;e|blood from Myn-than; and tickled their ears and their no&s;es: they &s;norted approbation, licked his toes, and &s;unk into a profound lethargy.</P>
<P>From this, however, they were &s;oon arrou&s;ed by unwelcome tidings from Fat&s;i&s;io. Yaff-rai had proceeded in his route until he was &s;topped by a va&s;t lake, which he could not po&s;|&s;ibly traver&s;e without boats, cork|jackets, or &s;ome &s;uch expedient, which could not be &s;upplied for that campaign. Ya-loff had &s;ailed up the river to Quib-quab, which he found &s;o &s;trongly fortified by nature, that it &s;eemed ra&s;hne&s;s even to at|tempt a landing, e&s;pecially in the face of an enemy more numerous than his own detachment. Land, however,
<PB N="44" REF="45">
he did, and even attacked a forti|fied camp of the Chine&s;e; but, in &s;pite of all his efforts, he was repul|&s;ed with con&s;iderable &s;laughter. He &s;ent an account of this mi&s;carriage to Taycho, giving him to under&s;tand, at the &s;ame time, that he had receiv|ed no intelligence of Yaff-rai's mo|tions; that his troops were greatly dimini&s;hed; that the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced to keep the field much longer; and that nothing was left them but a choice of difficulties, every one of which &s;eemed more in&s;urmount|able than another. Taycho having deliberated on this &s;ubject, thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the mon|&s;ter for the wor&s;t that could hap|pen, as he now expected to hear by the fir&s;t opportunity, that the grand expedition of Fat&s;i&s;io had to|tally mi&s;carried. He re&s;olved there|fore to throw the blame upon the &s;houlders of Ya-loff and Yaff-rai,
<PB N="45" REF="46">
and &s;tigmatize them as the creatures of Fika-kaka, who had neither abi|lity to comprehend the in&s;tructions he had given, nor re&s;olution to exe|cute the plan he had projected. For this purpo&s;e he a&s;cended the ro&s;|trum, and with a rueful length of face opened his harangue upon the defeat of Ya-loff. The Hydra no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the troops of Japan had been di&s;comfited, than it was &s;eized with a kind of hy&s;teric fit, and uttered a yell &s;o loud and horrible, that the blind-fold Dairo trembled in the mo&s;t internal rece&s;&s;es of his palace: the Cuboy Fika-kaka had &s;uch a profu&s;e evacuation, that the di&s;charge is &s;aid to have weighed five Boll-ah, equal to eight and forty pounds three ounces and two penny|weight averdupois of Great-Britain. Even Taycho him&s;elf was di&s;com|po&s;ed.&mdash;In vain he pre&s;ented the draught of yea&s;t, and the goblet

of blood:&mdash;in vain his pipers &s;ooth|ed the ears, and his tall fellows tickled the no&s;e of the blatant bea&s;t. It continued to howl and grin, and gna&s;h its teeth, and writhe it&s;elf in|to a thou&s;and contortions, as if it had been troubled with that twi&s;ting of the guts called the iliac pa&s;&s;ion. Tay|cho began to think its ca&s;e de&s;perate, and &s;ent for the Dairo's chief phy|&s;ician, who pre&s;cribed a gly&s;ter of the di&s;tilled &s;pirit analogous to your Geneva; but no apothecary nor old woman in Meaco would un|dertake to admini&s;ter it on any con|&s;ideration, the patient was &s;uch a filthy, aukward, lubberly, unma|nageable bea&s;t.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If what comes from its mouths (&s;aid they) be &s;o foul, virulent, and pe&s;tilential, how nau&s;eous, poi&s;onous, and intolerable mu&s;t that be which takes the other cour&s;e?"</Q>&mdash;When Taycho's art and fore&s;ight were at a &s;tand, accident
<PB N="47" REF="48">
came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A courier arrived, preceded by twelve po&s;tilions blowing horns; and he brought the news that Quib-quab was taken. The orator commanded them to place their horns within as many of the mon&s;ter's long ears, and blow with all their might, until it &s;hould exhibit &s;ome &s;igns of hearing. The experi|ment &s;ucceeded. The Hydra waking from its trance, opened its eyes; and Taycho &s;eizing this opportunity, hollowed in his loude&s;t tone, <Q REND="inline">"Quib-quab is taken."</Q> This note being re|peated, the bea&s;t &s;tarted up; then, rai&s;ing it&s;elf on its hind legs, began to wag its tail, to fri&s;k and fawn, to lick Taycho's &s;weaty &s;ocks: in fine, crouching on its belly, it took the orator on its back, and proceeding through the &s;treets of Meaco, brayed aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Make way for the divine Taycho!

Ya-loff, the real conqueror of Quib-quab, was no more.&mdash;He fell in the battle by which the conque&s;t was atchieved, yet not before he &s;aw victory declare in his favour. He had made incredible efforts to &s;urmount the difficulties that &s;urrounded him. At length he found means to &s;cale a perpendicular rock, which the enemy had left unguarded, on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion that nature had made it inac|ce&s;&s;ible. This exploit was perform|ed in the night, and in the morn|ing the Chine&s;e &s;aw his troops drawn up in order of battle on the plains of Quib-quab. As their numbers greatly exceeded the Japone&s;e, they did not decline the trial; and in a little time both armies were engag|ed. The conte&s;t, however, was not of long duration, tho' it proved fatal to the general on each &s;ide.&mdash;Ya-loff being &s;lain, the command devolved up|on Tohn-&s;yn, who pur&s;ued the enemy
<PB N="49" REF="50">
to the walls of Quib-quab, which was next day &s;urrendered to him by capi|tulation. Nothing was now &s;een and heard in the capital but jubilee, tri|umph, and intoxication; and, indeed, the nation had not for &s;ome centu|ries, &s;een &s;uch an occa&s;ion for joy and &s;atisfaction. The only per&s;on that did not heartily rejoice was the Dairo Got-hama-baba. By this time he was &s;o Tartari&s;ed, that he grudged his &s;ubjects every advantage obtain|ed in Fat&s;i&s;io; and when Fika-kaka hobbled up to him with the news of the victory, in&s;tead of &s;aluting him with the kick of approbation, he turned his back upon him, &s;ay|ing <Q REND="inline">"Boh! boh! What do you tell me of Quib-quab? The damned Chine&s;e are &s;till on the frontiers of Ye&s;&s;o."</Q> As to the bea&s;t, it was doomed to undergo a variety of agi|tation. Its pre&s;ent gambols were in|terrupted by a fre&s;h alarm from Chi|na.
<PB N="50" REF="51">
It was reported that two great ar|maments were equipped for a double de&s;cent upon the dominions of Japan: that one of the&s;e had already &s;ailed north about for the i&s;land of Xicoco, to make a diver&s;ion in favour of the other, which, being the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable, was de&s;igned for the &s;ou|thern coa&s;t of Japan. The&s;e tidings, which were not without foundation, had &s;uch an effect upon the multi|tudinous mon&s;ter, that it was fir&s;t of all &s;eized with an univer&s;al &s;hiver|ing. Its teeth chattered &s;o loud, that the &s;ound was heard at the di&s;tance of half a league; and for &s;ome time it was &s;truck dumb. During this paroxy&s;m it crawled &s;ilently on its belly to a &s;and-hill ju&s;t without the walls of Meaco, and began to &s;cratch the earth with great eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance. Some people imagined it was digging for gold: but the truth is, the bea&s;t was making a hole
<PB N="51" REF="52">
to hide it&s;elf from the enemy, whom it dur&s;t not look in the face; for, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved of this bea&s;t, it was equally timorous and cruel; equally cowardly and in&s;olent.&mdash;So hard it laboured at this cavern, that it had actually burrowed it&s;elf all but the tail, when its good angel Taycho whi&s;tled it out, with the news of another compleat victory gained over the Chine&s;e at &s;ea, by the Sey-&s;eo-gun Phal-khan, who had &s;ure enough di&s;comfited or de|&s;troyed the great armament of the ene|my. As for the other &s;mall &s;quadron which had &s;teered a northerly cour&s;e to Xicoco, it was encountered, de|feated, taken, and brought into the harbours of Japan, by three light Fune, under the command of a young chief called Hel-y-otte, who happen|ed to be crui&s;ing on that part of the coa&s;t.&mdash;The bea&s;t hearing Taycho's au&s;picious whi&s;tle, crept out with its
<PB N="52" REF="53">
buttocks foremo&s;t, and having done him homage in the u&s;ual &s;tile, be|gan to react its former extravagan|ces. It now con&s;idered this dema|gogue as the &s;upreme giver of all good, and adored him accordingly. The apo&s;tle Bupo was no longer in|voked. The temple of Fakkuba&s;i was almo&s;t forgotten; and the Bonzas were univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed. The prai&s;e of the prophet Taycho had &s;wallow|ed up all other wor&s;hip.&mdash;Let us en|quire how far he merited this ado|ration: how ju&s;tly the unparalleled &s;ucce&s;s of this year was a&s;cribed to his conduct and &s;agacity. Kho-rh&eacute; was taken by Kha-fell, and Quib-quab by Ya-loff and Thon-&s;yn. By land, the Chine&s;e were defeated in Fat&s;i&s;io by Yan-o-ni; in the extre|mity of A&s;ia, by Khutt-whang; and in Tartary, by the Japone&s;e bull-dogs, without command or direction. At &s;ea one of their &s;quadrons had been
<PB N="53" REF="54">
de&s;troyed by Or-nbos; a &s;econd by Fa&s;-khan; a third was taken by Hel-y-otte; a fourth was wor&s;ted and put to flight in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive engage|ments near the land of Kamt|&s;chatka, by the chief Bha-kakh; and their grand armament defeated by the Sey-&s;eo-gun Phal-khan. But Kha-fell was a &s;tranger to orator Taycho: Ya-loff he had never &s;een: the bull-dogs had been collected at random from the &s;hambles of Meaco: he had never heard of Yan-o-ni's name, till he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his fir&s;t victory; nor did he know there was any &s;uch per&s;on as Khutt-whang ex|i&s;ting. As for Or-nbos, Fa&s;-khan, Phal-khan, and Bha-kakh, they had been Sey-&s;eo-guns in con&s;tant em|ployment under the former admini|&s;tration; and the youth Hel-y-otte owed his promotion to the intere&s;t of his own family.&mdash;But it may be alledged, that Taycho projected in
<PB N="54" REF="55">
his clo&s;et tho&s;e plans that were crown|ed with &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;We have &s;een how he mutilated and frittered the origi|nal &s;cheme of the campaign in Fat|&s;i&s;io, &s;o as to leave it at the caprice of Fortune. The reduction of Kho-rh&eacute; was part of the de&s;ign formed by the Banyan Thum-khumm-qua, which Taycho did all that lay in his power to render abortive. The plan of operati|ons in the extremity of Tartary, he did not pretend to meddle with;&mdash;it was the concern of the officers appointed by the trading company there &s;ettled: and as to the advantages obtained at &s;ea, they naturally re&s;ulted from the di&s;po&s;ition of crui&s;es, made and regu|lated by the board of Sey-&s;eo-gun-&s;ealty, with which no mini&s;ter ever interfered. He might, indeed, have recalled the chiefs and officers whom he found already appointed when he took the reins of admini&s;tration, and filled their places with others of
<PB N="55" REF="56">
his own choo&s;ing. How far he was qualified to make &s;uch a choice, and plan new expeditions, appears from the adventures of the generals he did appoint; Moria-tanti, who was deterred from landing by a per&s;pec|tive view of whi&s;kers; Hylib-bib, who left his rear in the lurch; and Hob-nob, who made &s;uch a ma&s;ter|ly retreat from the &s;uppo&s;ed Bonzas of Thin-quo.&mdash;The&s;e three were li|terally commanders of his own crea|tion, employed in executing &s;chemes of his own projecting; and the&s;e three were the only generals he made, and the only military plans he pro|jected, if we except the grand &s;cheme of &s;ub&s;idizing Brut-an-tiffi, and form|ing an army of one hundred thou&s;and men in Tartary, for the defence of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o.&mdash;Things being &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced, it may be ea&s;ily conceiv|ed that the Orator could a&s;k nothing which the Mobile would venture to
<PB N="56" REF="57">
refu&s;e; and indeed he tried his influ|ence to the utmo&s;t &s;tretch; he milk|ed the dugs of the mon&s;ter till the blood came. For the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, he &s;queezed from them near twelve millions of obans, amount|ing to near twenty-four millions &s;ter|ling, about four times as much as had ever been rai&s;ed by the empire of Japan in any former war. But, by this time, Taycho was become not only a convert to the &s;y&s;tem of Tartary, which he had formerly per|&s;ecuted, but al&s;o an enthu&s;ia&s;t in love and admiration of Brut-an-tiffi, who had lately &s;ent him his poetical works in a pre&s;ent. This, however, would have been of no u&s;e, as he could not read them, had not he di&s;co|vered they were printed on a very fine, &s;oft, &s;mooth Chine&s;e paper made of &s;ilk, which he happily converted to another fundamental purpo&s;e. In return for this compliment, the Ora|tor
<PB N="57" REF="58">
&s;ent him a bullock's horn bound with bra&s;s, value fifteen pence, which had long &s;erved him as a pitch-pipe when he made harangues to the Mo|bile;&mdash;it was the &s;ame kind of in&s;tru|ment which Horace de&s;cribes; <HI>Tibia vincta orichalco:</HI> and pray take no|tice, Peacock, this was the only pre|&s;ent Taycho ever be&s;towed on any man, woman, or child, through the whole cour&s;e of his life, I mean out of his own pocket; for he was ex|tremely liberal of the public money, in his &s;ub&s;idies to the Tartar chiefs, and in the pro&s;ecution of the war upon that continent. The Orator was a genius &s;elf-taught without the help of human in&s;titution. He affected to undervalue all men of lite|rary talents; and the only book he ever read with any degree of plea|&s;ure, was a collection of rhap&s;odies preached by one Ab-ren-thi, an ob|&s;cure fanatic Bonza, a native of the
<PB N="58" REF="59">
i&s;land Xicoco. Certain it is, Na|ture &s;eemed to have produced him for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fa&s;cinating the mob, and endued him with faculties accordingly.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all his efforts in behalf of the Tartarian &s;cheme, the Chine&s;e &s;till lingered on the frontiers of Ye&s;&s;o. The views of the court of Pekin exactly coincided with the intere&s;t of Bron-xi-tic, the mercenary general of Japan. The Chine&s;e, con|founded at the unheard-of &s;ucce&s;s of the Japone&s;e in Fat&s;i&s;io and other parts of the globe, and extremely mortified at the de&s;truction of their fleets and the ruin of their com|merce, &s;aw no other way of di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing the enemy, but that of prolong|ing the war on the continent of Tar|tary, which they could &s;upport for little more than their ordinary ex|pence; whereas Japan could not main|tain it without contracting yearly im|men&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="60">
loads of debt, which mu&s;t have cru&s;hed it at the long-run. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Chine&s;e, therefore, not to fini&s;h the war in Tartary by taking the farm of Ye&s;&s;o, becau&s;e, in that ca&s;e, the annual expence of it would have been &s;aved to Japan; but to keep it alive by forced marches, praedatory excur&s;ions, and undeci&s;ive actions; and this was preci&s;ely the intere&s;t of general Bron-xi-tic, who in the continuance of the war en|joyed the continuance of all his emo|luments. All that he had to do, then, was to furni&s;h Taycho from time to time with a ca&s;k of human blood, for the entertainment of the blatant bea&s;t; and to &s;end over a few hor&s;e-tails, as trophies of pretended victories, to be waved before the mon&s;ter in its holiday proce&s;&s;ions. He and the Chine&s;e general &s;eemed to act in concert. They advanced and retreated in their turns betwixt
<PB N="60" REF="61">
two given lines, and the campaign al|ways ended on the &s;ame &s;pot where it began. The only difference be|tween them was in the motives of their conduct; the Chine&s;e commander acted for the benefit of his &s;overeign, and Bron-xi-tic acted for his own.</P>
<P>The continual danger to which the farm of Ye&s;&s;o was expo&s;ed, pro|duced &s;uch apprehen&s;ions and cha|grin in the mind of the Dairo Got-hama-baba, that his health began to decline. He neglected his food and his rattle, and no longer took any plea&s;ure in kicking the Cuboy. He frequently muttered ejaculations about the farm of Ye&s;&s;o: nay, once or twice in the tran&s;ports of his im|patience, he pulled the bandage from his eyes, and cur&s;ed Taycho in the Tartarian language. At length he fell into a lethargy, and even when rou&s;ed a little by bli&s;ters and cau&s;|tics, &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of every thing
<PB N="61" REF="62">
that was done about him. The&s;e bli&s;ters were rai&s;ed by burning the moxa upon his &s;calp. The powder of <HI>menoki</HI> was al&s;o injected in a gly&s;ter; and the operation of acu|puncture, called <HI>Senkei,</HI> performed without effect. His di&s;order was &s;o &s;tubborn, that the Cuboy began to think he was bewitched, and &s;u&s;|pected Taycho of having practi&s;ed &s;orcery on his &s;overeign. He com|municated this &s;u&s;picion to Mura|clami, who &s;hook his head, and ad|vi&s;ed that, with the Orator's good leave, the council &s;hould be con&s;ult|ed. Taycho, who had gained an ab|&s;olute empire over the mind of the Dairo, and could not fore&s;ee how his intere&s;t might &s;tand with his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or, was heartily di&s;po&s;ed to concur in any &s;ea&s;ible experiment for the recovery of Got-hama-baba: he therefore con&s;ented that the mouths of the council &s;hould be unpadlock|ed
<PB N="62" REF="63">
<HI>pro hac vice,</HI> and the members were a&s;&s;embled without delay; with this ex|pre&s;s provi&s;o, however, that they were to confine their deliberations to the &s;ubject of the Dairo and his di&s;temper. By this time the phy&s;icians had di&s;|covered the cau&s;e of the di&s;order, which was no other than his being &s;tung by a poi&s;onous in&s;ect produced in the land of Ye&s;&s;o, analogous to the tarantula, which is &s;aid to do &s;o much mi&s;chief in &s;ome parts of Apuglia, as we are told by Aelian, Epiphanius Ferdinandus, and Baglivi. In both ca&s;es the only effectual reme|dy was mu&s;ic; and now the council was called to determine what &s;ort of mu&s;ic &s;hould be admini&s;tered. You mu&s;t know, Peacock, the Japone&s;e are but indifferently &s;killed in this art, tho', in general, they affect to be connoi&s;&s;eurs. They are utterly igno|rant of the theory, and in the prac|tice are excelled by all their neigh|bours,
<PB N="63" REF="64">
the Tartars not excepted. For my own part, I &s;tudied mu&s;ic under Pythagoras at Crotona. He found the &s;cale of &s;even tones imperfect, and added the octave as a fixed, &s;en|&s;ible, and intelligent termination of an interval, which included every po&s;&s;ible divi&s;ion, and determined all the relative differences of &s;ounds: be&s;ides, he taught us how to expre&s;s the octave by &frac12;, &amp;c. &amp;c. But why &s;hould I talk to thee of the an|tient digramma, the genera, &amp;c. of mu&s;ic, which with their colours, were con&s;tructed by a divi&s;ion of the diate&s;&s;aron. Thou art too dull and ignorant to comprehend the chro|matic &s;pecies, the con&s;truction of the tetrachord, the Phrygian, the Ly|dian, and other modes of the antient mu&s;ic: and for di&s;tinction of ear, thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tly ranked among the braying tribe that graze along the ditches of Tottenham-court or Hock|ley-i'the-hole.
<PB N="64" REF="65">
I know that nothing exhilarates thy &s;pirits &s;o much as a &s;o|nata on the &s;alt-box, or a concert of marrow-bones and cleavers. The ears of the Japone&s;e were much of the &s;ame texture; and their mu&s;ic was &s;uited to their ears. They neither excelled in the melopoeia, and rythm or ca|dence; nor did they know any thing of the true &s;cience of harmony, com|po&s;itions in parts, and tho&s;e combi|nations of &s;ounds, the invention of which, with the improvement of the &s;cale, is erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribed to a Be|nedictine monk. The truth is, the antients under&s;tood compo&s;ition per|fectly well. Their &s;cale was found|ed upon perfect con&s;onances: they were remarkably nice in temper|ing &s;ounds, and had reduced their intervals and concords to mathemati|cal demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>But, to return to the council of Twenty-eight, they convened in the
<PB N="65" REF="66">
&s;ame apartment where the Dairo lay; and as the bu&s;ine&s;s was to de|termine what kind of mu&s;ic was mo&s;t likely to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon his organs, every member came pro|vided with his expedient. Fir&s;t and foremo&s;t, Mr. Orator Taycho pro|nounced an oration upon the excel|lences of the land of Ye&s;&s;o, of ener|gy (as the Cuboy &s;aid) &s;ufficient to draw the moon from her &s;phere; it drew nothing, however, from the patient but a &s;ingle groan: then the Fatzman cau&s;ed a drum to beat, without producing any effect at all upon the Dairo; tho' it deprived the whole council of their hearing for &s;ome time. The third e&s;&s;ay was made by Fika-kaka; fir&s;t with a rat|tle, and then with tongs and grid|iron, which la&s;t was his favourite mu&s;ic; but here it failed, to his great &s;urprize and con&s;ternation. Sti|phi-rum-poo brought the crier of his
<PB N="66" REF="67">
court to promulgate a decree again&s;t Ye&s;&s;o, in a voice that is wont to make the culprit tremble; but the Dairo was found Ignoramus. Nin-com-poo-po blew a bla&s;t with a kind of boat&s;wain's whi&s;tle, which di&s;com|po&s;ed the whole audience without af|fecting the emperor. Fokh&mdash;&s;i&mdash;rokhu &s;aid he would try his im|perial maje&s;ty with a &s;ound which he had always been known to pre|fer to every other &s;pecies of mu&s;ic; and pulling out a huge pur&s;e of golden obans, began to chink them in his ear.&mdash;This experiment &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that the Dairo was perceived to &s;mile, and even to con|tract one hand: but further effect it had none. At la&s;t Gotto-mio &s;tart|ing up, threw a &s;mall quantity of <HI>aurum fulminans</HI> into the fire, which went off with &s;uch an explo&s;ion, that in the &s;ame in&s;tant Fika-kaha fell flat upon his face, and Got-hama-baba
<PB N="67" REF="68">
&s;tarted upright in his bed. This, however, was no more than a convul&s;ion that put an end to his life; for he fell back again, and ex|pired in the twinkling of an eye.&mdash;As for the Cuboy, tho' he did not die, he underwent a &s;urpri&s;ing tran&s;|formation or metamorpho&s;is, which I &s;hall record in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Taycho was no &s;ooner certified that Got-hama-baba had actually breathed his la&s;t, than he vani&s;hed from the council in the twinkling of an eye, and mounting the bea&s;t who&s;e name is Legion, rode full &s;peed to the habitation of <HI>Gio-gio,</HI> the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or and de&s;cendant of the decea&s;ed Dairo.&mdash;Gio-gio was a young prince who had been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;eque&s;tered from the public view, and excluded from all &s;hare in the affairs of &s;tate by the jealou&s;y of the
<PB N="68" REF="69">
la&s;t emperor.&mdash;He lived retired un|der the wings of his grand-mother, and had divers preceptors to teach him the rudiments of every art but the art of reigning. Of all tho&s;e who &s;uperintended his education, he who in&s;inuated him&s;elf the farthe&s;t in his favour, was one <HI>Yak-&s;trot,</HI> from the mountains of Ximo, who valued him|&s;elf much upon the antient blood that ran in his veins, and &s;till more upon his elevated ideas of patriot|i&s;m. Yak-&s;trot was hone&s;t at bot|tom, but proud, re&s;erved, vain, and affected. He had a turn for nick-nacks and gim-cracks, and once made and mounted an iron jack and a wooden clock with his own hands. But it was his misfortune to &s;et up for a connoi&s;&s;eur in paint|ing and other liberal arts, and to an|nounce him&s;elf an univer&s;al patron of genius. He did not fail to infu&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="70">
his own notions and conceits into the tender mind of Gio-gio, who gradu|ally imbibed his turn of thinking, and followed the &s;tudies which he recommended.&mdash;With re&s;pect to his le&s;&s;ons on the art of government, he reduced them to a very few &s;im|ple principles.&mdash;His maxims were the&s;e: That the emperor of Japan ought to cheri&s;h the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion, both by precept and exam|ple; that he ought to aboli&s;h cor|ruption, di&s;courage faction, and balance the two parties by admitting an equal number from each, to places and offices of tru&s;t in the admini&s;tra|tion: that he &s;hould make peace as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, even in de&s;pite of the public, which &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of the burthen it &s;u&s;tained, and was indeed growing delirious by the il|lu&s;ions of Taycho, and the cruel eva|cuations he had pre&s;cribed: that he &s;hould retrench all &s;uperfluous ex|pence
<PB N="70" REF="71">
in his hou&s;hold and govern|ment, and detach him&s;elf intirely from the accur&s;ed farm of Ye&s;&s;o, which &s;ome evil genius had fixed upon the breech of Japan, as a cancerous ulcer thro' which all her blood and &s;ub&s;tance would be di&s;charged. The&s;e maxims were generally ju&s;t enough in &s;pecu|lation, but &s;ome of them were alto|gether impracticable;&mdash;for example, that of forming an admini&s;tration equally compo&s;ed of the two &s;ac|tions, was as ab&s;urd as it would be to yoke two &s;tone-hor&s;es and two jack-a&s;&s;es in the &s;ame carriage, which, in&s;tead of drawing one way, would do nothing but bite and kick one another, while the machine of go|vernment would &s;tand &s;tock-&s;till, or perhaps be torn in pieces by their dragging in oppo&s;ite directions.&mdash;The people of Japan had been long divided between two inveterate par|ties known by the names of <HI>Shit-tilk-um&s;-heit,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="72">
and <HI>She-it-kum&s;-hi-til,</HI> the fir&s;t &s;ignifying <HI>more fool than knave;</HI> and the other, <HI>more knave than fool.</HI> Each had predominated in its turn, by &s;ecuring a majority in the a&s;&s;em|blies of the people; for the majori|ty had always intere&s;t to force them|&s;elves into the admini&s;tration; be|cau&s;e the con&s;titution being partly democratic, the Dairo was &s;till obliged to truckle to the prevailing faction.&mdash;To obtain this majority, each &s;ide had employed every art of corruption, calumny, in&s;inuation, and prie&s;t-craft; for nothing is &s;uch an effectual ferment in all po|pular commotions as religious fana|tici&s;m.&mdash;No &s;ooner one party ac|compli&s;hed its aim than it repro|bated the other, branding it with the epithets of traitors to their country, or traitors to their prince; while the minority retorted upon them the charge of corruption, ra|paciou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="72" REF="73">
and abject &s;ervility. In &s;hort, both parties were equally abu|&s;ive, rancorous, uncandid, and illi|beral. Taycho had been of both factions more than once.&mdash;He made his fir&s;t appearance as a <HI>Shi-tilk-um&s;-heit</HI> in the minority, and di&s;played his talent for &s;currility again&s;t the Dairo to &s;uch advantage, that an old rich hag, who loved nothing &s;o well as money, except the gra|tification of her revenge, made him a pre&s;ent of five thou&s;and obans, on condition he &s;hould continue to revile the Dairo till his dying|day.&mdash;After her death, the mini&s;|try, intimidated by the boldne&s;s of his tropes, and the fame he be|gan to acquire as a mal-content orator, made him &s;uch offers as he thought proper to accept; and then he turned <HI>She-it-kum&s;-hi-til.</HI>&mdash;Being di&s;gu&s;ted in the &s;equel, at his own want of importance in the
<PB N="73" REF="74">
council, he opened once more at the head of his old friends the <HI>Shi-tilk-um&s;-hitites;</HI> and once more he de|&s;erted them to rule the roa&s;t, as chief of the <HI>She-it-kum&s;-hi-tilites,</HI> in which predicament he now &s;tood. And, in|deed, this was the mo&s;t natural po&s;|ture in which he could &s;tand; for this party embraced all the &s;cum of the people, con&s;tituting the blatant bea&s;t, which his talents were &s;o peculiarly adapted to manage and go|vern. Another impracticable maxim of Yak-&s;trot, was the abolition of corruption, the ordure of which is as nece&s;&s;ary to anoint the wheels of government in Japan, as grea&s;e is to &s;mear the axle-tree of a loaded wag|gon. His third impolitic (tho' not impracticable) maxim, was that of making peace while the populace were intoxicated with the &s;teams of blood, and elated with the &s;hews of triumph. Be that as it will, Gio|gio,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
attended by Yak-&s;trot, was draw|ing plans of windmills, when Orator Taycho, opening the door, advanced towards him, and falling on his knees, addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"The empire of Japan (magnanimous prince!) re&s;embles at this in&s;tant, a benighted traveller, who by the light of the &s;tar He&s;perus continued his journey without repining, until that glorious luminary &s;etting, left him bewildered in darkne&s;s and con|&s;ternation: but &s;carce had he time to bewail his fate, when the more glorious &s;un, the ruler of a fre&s;h day, appearing on the tops of the Ea&s;|tern hills, di&s;pelled his terrors with the &s;hades of night, and filled his &s;oul with tran&s;ports of plea&s;ure and de|light. The illu&s;trious Got-hama-baba, of honoured memory, is the glorious &s;tar which hath &s;et on our hemi&s;phere.&mdash;His &s;oul, which took wing about two hours ago, is now
<PB N="75" REF="76">
happily ne&s;tled in the bo&s;om of the ble&s;&s;ed Bupo; and you, my prince, are the more glorious ri&s;ing &s;un, who&s;e genial influence will chear the empire, and gladden the hearts of your faithful Japone&s;e.&mdash;I therefore hail your &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and cry aloud, Long live the ever-glorious Gio-gio, emperor of the three i&s;lands of Japan."</Q> To this &s;alutation the bea&s;t below brayed hoar&s;e applau&s;e; and all pre&s;ent ki&s;&s;ed the hand of the new emperor, who, kneeling before his venerable grandame, craved her ble&s;&s;ing, de&s;iring the benefit of her prayers, that God would make him a good king, and e&s;tabli&s;h his throne in righteou&s;ne&s;s. Then he a&s;cended his chariot, accompanied by the Orator and his beloved Yak-&s;trot, and proceeding to the palace of Meaco, was proclaimed with the u&s;ual ceremonies, his relation the Fatz-man and other princes of
<PB N="76" REF="77">

<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took after his eleva|tion, was to publi&s;h a decree, or rather exhortation, to honour religion and the Bonzes; and this was no impolitic expedient: for it firmly attached that numerous and powerful tribe to his intere&s;t. His next mea&s;ures did not &s;eem to be directed by the &s;ame &s;pi|rit of di&s;cretion. He admitted a parcel of raw boys, and even &s;ome individuals of the faction of <HI>Shi-tilk-um&s;-heit</HI> into his council; and though Taycho &s;till continued to manage the reins of admini&s;tration, Yak-&s;trot was a&s;&s;ociated with him in office, to the great &s;candal and di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Niphonites, who hate all the Xi|mians with a mixture of jealou&s;y and contempt.</P>
<P>Fika-kaka was not the la&s;t who payed his re&s;pects to his new &s;o|vereign, by whom he was graci|ou&s;ly received, altho' he did not &s;eem quite &s;atisfied; becau&s;e when
<PB N="77" REF="78">
he pre&s;ented him&s;elf in his u&s;ual at|titude, he had not received the kick of approbation. New reigns, new cu&s;toms: This Dairo never dreamed of kicking tho&s;e whom he delighted to honour.&mdash;It was a &s;ecret of &s;tate which had not yet come to his knowledge; and Yak-&s;trot had al|ways a&s;&s;ured him, that kicking the breech always and every-where im|plied di&s;grace, as kicking the parts before, betokens ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion. Yak-&s;trot, however, in this particu|lar, &s;eems to have been too confined in his notions of the <HI>etiquette:</HI> for it had been the cu&s;tom time imme|morial for the Dairos of Japan to kick their favourites and prime mini&s;ters. Be&s;ides, there are at this day diffe|rent &s;orts of kicks u&s;ed even in Eng|land, without occa&s;ioning any di&s;ho|nour to the <HI>Kickee.</HI>&mdash;It is &s;ome|times a misfortune to be <HI>kicked</HI> out of place, but no di&s;honour. A man
<PB N="78" REF="79">
is often <HI>kicked up</HI> in the way of pre|ferment, in order that his place may be given to a per&s;on of more intere&s;t. Then there is the amorous kick, called <HI>Kick 'um, Jenny,</HI> which every gallant undergoes with plea&s;ure: hence the old Engli&s;h appellation of <HI>Kick&s;y-wick&s;y,</HI> be&s;towed on a wanton leman who knew all her paces. As for the familiar kick, it is no other than a mark of friend&s;hip: nor is it more di&s;honourable to be cuffed and cudgelled. Every body knows that the <HI>alapa</HI> or box o' the ear, among the Romans, was a particular mark of favour by which their &s;laves were made free; and the favourite gla|diator, when he obtained his di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion from the &s;ervice, was honoured with a found cudgelling; this being the true meaning of the phra&s;e <HI>rude donatus.</HI> In the times of chivalry, the knight when dubbed, was well thwacked acro&s;s the &s;houlders by his
<PB N="79" REF="80">
god-father in arms.&mdash;Indeed, <HI>dubbing</HI> is no other than a corruption of <HI>drub|bing.</HI> It was the cu&s;tom formerly here and el&s;ewhere, for a man to drub his &s;on or apprentice as a mark of his freedom, and of his being ad|mitted to the exerci&s;e of arms. The Para&s;chi&s;tes, who practi&s;ed <HI>em|balming</HI> in Aegypt, which was count|ed a very honourable profe&s;&s;ion, was always &s;everely drubbed after the operation, by the friends and rela|tions of the defunct; and to this day, the patriarch of the Greeks once a year, on Ea&s;ter-eve, when he carries out the &s;acred fire from the holy &s;e|pulchre of Jeru&s;alem, is heartily cudgelled by the infidels, a certain number of whom he hires for that purpo&s;e; and he thinks him&s;elf very unhappy and much di&s;graced, if he is not beaten into all the colours of the rain-bow. You know the Qua|kers of this country think it no di&s;|honour
<PB N="80" REF="81">
to receive a &s;lap o' the face; but when you &s;mite them on one cheek, they pre&s;ent the other, that it may have the &s;ame &s;alutation. The venerable father Lactantius falls out with Cicero for &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"A good man hurts no-body, unle&s;s he is ju&s;tly provoked;"</Q> <HI>ni&s;i lace&s;&s;itur injuria. O,</HI> (cries the good father) <HI>quam &s;impli|cem veramque &s;ententiam duorum ver|borum adjectione corrupit!&mdash;non minus enim mali e&s;t, referre injuriam, quam in|ferre.</HI> The great philo&s;opher Socra|tes thought it no di&s;grace to be kick|ed by his wife Xantippe; nay, he is &s;aid to have undergone the &s;ame di&s;|cipline from other people, without making the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, it being his opinion that it was more coura|geous, con&s;equently more honourable, to bear a drubbing patiently, than to attempt any thing either in the way of &s;elf-defence or retaliation.&mdash;The judicious and learned Puffendorf, in
<PB N="81" REF="82">
his book <HI>De Jure Gentium &amp; Naturali,</HI> declares, that a man's honour is not &s;o fragile as to be hurt either by a box on the ear, or a kick on the breech, otherwi&s;e it would be in the power of every &s;aucy fellow to dimini&s;h or infringe it.&mdash;It mu&s;t be owned, in|deed, Grotius <HI>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</HI> &s;ays, that charity does not of it&s;elf require our patiently &s;uffering &s;uch an affront. The Engli&s;h have with a mo&s;t &s;ervile imitation, borrowed their <HI>punto,</HI> as well as other modes, from the French nation. Now kick|ing and cuffing were counted infa|mous among tho&s;e people for the&s;e rea&s;ons. A box on the ear de&s;troys the whole oeconomy of their <HI>fri&s;ure,</HI> upon which they be&s;tow the greate&s;t part of their time and attention; and a kick on the breech is attended with great pain and danger, as they are generally &s;ubject to the piles. This is &s;o truly the ca&s;e, that they have
<PB N="82" REF="83">
no le&s;s than two &s;aints to patronize and protect the individuals afflicted with this di&s;ea&s;e. One is St. <HI>Fiacre,</HI> who was a native of the kingdom of Ireland. He pre&s;ides over the blind piles. The other is a female &s;aint, <HI>Hoe|morrhoi&s;&s;a,</HI> and &s;he comforts tho&s;e who are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the bleeding piles. No wonder, therefore, that a French|man put to the torture by a kick on tho&s;e tender parts, &s;hould be pro|voked to vengeance; and that this vengeance &s;hould gradually become an article in their &s;y&s;tem of punctilio.</P>
<P>But, to return to the thread of my narration.&mdash;Whatever inclination the Dairo and Yak-&s;trot had to re|&s;tore the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, they did not think proper as yet to combat the di&s;po&s;ition and &s;chemes of Ora|tor Taycho; in con&s;equence of who&s;e remon&s;trances, the tributary treaty was immediately renewed with Brut-an-tiffi, and Gio-gio declared in the
<PB N="83" REF="84">
a&s;&s;embly of the people, that he was determined to &s;upport that illu&s;trious ally, and carry on the war with vi|gour.&mdash;By this time the Chine&s;e were in a manner expelled from their chief &s;ettlements in Fat&s;i&s;io, where they now retained nothing but an incon&s;iderable colony, which would have &s;ubmitted on the fir&s;t &s;um|mons: but this Taycho left as a ne&s;t-egg to produce a new brood of di&s;turbance to the Japone&s;e &s;ettle|ments, that they might not ru&s;t with too much peace and &s;ecurity. To be plain with you, Peacock, his thoughts were entirely alienated from this Fat&s;i&s;ian war, in which the intere&s;t of his country was chiefly concerned, and converted wholly to the conti|nent of Tartary, where all his cares centered in &s;chemes for the &s;ucce&s;s of his friend Brut-an-tiffi. This free|booter had lately undergone &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune. He had &s;een
<PB N="84" REF="85">
his chief village po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and plun|dered by the enemy; but he found means, by &s;urprize, to beat up their quarters in the beginning of winter, which always proved his be&s;t ally, becau&s;e then the Mantchoux Tar|tars were obliged to retire to their own country, at a va&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;eat of the war.&mdash;As for Bron-xi|tic, who commanded the Japone&s;e ar|my on that continent, he continued to play booty with the Chine&s;e ge|neral, over whom he was allowed to obtain &s;ome petty advantages, which, with the trophies won by Brut-an|tiffi, were &s;welled up into mighty victories, to increa&s;e the infatua|tion of the blatant bea&s;t.&mdash;On the other hand, Bron-xi-tic obliged the generals of China with the like indul|gences, by now and then &s;acrificing a detachment of his Japone&s;e troops, to keep up the &s;pirits of that nation.</P>
<P>Taycho had levied upon the people
<PB N="85" REF="86">
of Japan an immen&s;e &s;um of money for the equipment of a naval arma|ment, the de&s;tination of which was kept a profound &s;ecret. Some politi|cians imagined it was de&s;igned for the conque&s;t of Thin-quo, and all the other &s;ettlements which the Chine&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the Indian ocean: others conjectured the intention was to at|tack the king of Corea, who had, &s;ince the beginning of this war, acted with a &s;hameful partiality in favour of the emperor of China, his kin&s;man and ally. But the truth of the matter was this: Taycho kept the armament in the harbours of Ja|pan ready for a de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of China, in order to make a diver&s;ion in favour of his friend Brut-an-tiffi, in ca&s;e he had run any ri&s;que of being oppre&s;&s;ed by his ene|mies. However, the bea&s;t of many heads having growled and grum|bled during the be&s;t part of the
<PB N="86" REF="87">
&s;ummer, at the inactivity of this expen&s;ive armament, it was now thought proper to &s;end it to &s;ea in the beginning of winter: but it was &s;oon driven back in great di&s;tre&s;s, by contrary winds and &s;torms;&mdash;and this was all the mon&s;ter had for its ten millions of Obans.</P>
<P>While Taycho amu&s;ed the Mobile with this winter expedition, Yak-&s;trot re&s;olved to plan the &s;cheme of oecono|my which he had projected. He di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from the Dairo's &s;ervice about a dozen of cooks and&s;cullions; &s;hut up one of the kitchens, after having &s;old the grates, hand-irons, &s;pits and &s;auce|pans; deprived the &s;ervants and officers of the hou&s;hold of their breakfa&s;t; took away their u&s;ual allowance of oil and candles; retrenched their tables; reduced their proportion of drink; and per&s;uaded his pupil the Dairo to put him&s;elf upon a diet of &s;oup|meagre thickened with oat-meal. In
<PB N="87" REF="88">
a few days there was no &s;moke &s;een to a&s;cend from the kitchens of the palace; nor did any fuel, torch, or taper blaze in the chimnies, courts, and apartments thereof, which now became the habitation of cold, dark|ne&s;s, and hunger. Gio-gio him&s;elf, who turned peripatetic philo&s;opher merely to keep him&s;elf in heat, fell into a wa&s;h-tub as he groped his way in the dark through one of the lower galleries. Two of his body-guard had their whi&s;kers gnawed off by the rats, as they &s;lept in his anti|chamber; and their captain pre&s;ent|ed a petition declaring, that neither he nor his men could undertake the defence of his imperial maje&s;ty's per|&s;on, unle&s;s their former allowance of provi&s;ion &s;hould be re&s;tored. They and all the individuals of the hou&s;e|hold were not only puni&s;hed in their bellies, but likewi&s;e curtailed in their clothing, and abridged in their &s;ti|pends.
<PB N="88" REF="89">
The palace of Meaco, which u&s;ed to be the temple of mirth, jol|lity, and good cheer, was now &s;o dreary and de&s;erted, that a certain wag fixed up a ticket on the outward gate with this in&s;cription: <Q REND="inline">"This tenement to be lett, the proprietor having left off hou&s;e-keeping."</Q></P>
<P>Yak-&s;trot, however, was re&s;olved to &s;hew, that if the new Dairo re|trenched the &s;uperfluities of his do|me&s;tic expence, he did not act from avarice or poorne&s;s of &s;pirit, ina&s;|much as he &s;hould now di&s;play his liberality in patronizing genius and the arts. A general jubilee was now promi&s;ed to all tho&s;e who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves by their talents or erudition. The emi&s;&s;aries of Yak|&s;trot declared that Maecenas was but a type of this Ximian mountaineer; and that he was determined to &s;earch for merit, even in the thicke&s;t &s;hades of ob&s;curity. All the&s;e re&s;earches,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
however, proved &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, that not above four or five men of ge|nius could be found in the whole empire of Japan, and the&s;e were gratified with pen&s;ions of about one hundred Obans each. One was a &s;e|cularized Bonza from Ximo; another a malcontent poet of Niphon; a third, a reformed comedian of Xi|coco; a fourth, an empiric, who had outlived his practice; and a fifth, a decayed apothecary, who was bard, quack, author, chymi&s;t, philo&s;opher, and &s;impler by profe&s;&s;ion. The whole of the expence ari&s;ing from the fa|vour and protection granted by the Dairo to the&s;e men of genius, did not exceed &s;even or eight hundred Obans per annum, amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds &s;terling; whereas many a private Quo in Ja|pan expended more money on a ken|nel of hounds. I do not mention tho&s;e men of &s;ingular merit, whom
<PB N="90" REF="91">
Yak-&s;trot fixed in e&s;tabli&s;hed places under the government; &s;uch as ar|chitects, a&s;tronomers, painters, phy|&s;icians, barbers, &amp;c. becau&s;e their &s;a|laries were included in the ordinary expence of the crown: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that a certain per&s;on who could not read, was appointed libra|rian to his imperial maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The&s;e were all the men of &s;uperla|tive genius, that Yak-&s;trot could find at this period in the empire of Japan.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this great patriot was thus employed in executing his &s;chemes of oeconomy with more zeal than di&s;cretion, and in providing his poor relations with lucrative offices under the government, a negociation for peace was brought upon the carpet by the mediation of certain neutral powers; and Orator Taycho arrogated to him&s;elf the province of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;everal articles of the treaty.&mdash;Up|on this occa&s;ion he &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;ur|prizingly
<PB N="91" REF="92">
remi&s;s and indifferent in whatever related to the intere&s;t of Japan, particularly in regulating and fixing the boundaries of the Chi|ne&s;e and Japone&s;e &s;ettlements in Fat|&s;i&s;io, the uncertainty of which had given ri&s;e to the war: but when the bu&s;ine&s;s was to determine the claims and preten&s;ions of his ally Brut-an-tiffi, on the continent of Tartary, he appeared &s;tiff and immoveable as mount Athos. He actually broke off the negotiation, becau&s;e the emperor of China would not engage to drive by force of arms the troops of his ally the prince&s;s of O&s;trog, from a village or two belonging to the Tartarian free-booter, who, by the bye, had left them defencele&s;s at the beginning of the war, on pur|po&s;e that his enemies might, by tak|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, quicken the re&s;olutions of the Dairo to &s;end over an army for the protection of Ye&s;&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
The court of Pekin perceiving that the Japone&s;e were rendered intole|rably in&s;olent and overbearing by &s;uc|ce&s;s, and that an equitable peace could not be obtained while Orator Taycho managed the reins of go|vernment at Meaco, and his friend Brut-an-tiffi found any thing to plunder in Tartary; re&s;olved to forti|fy them&s;elves with a new alliance. They actually entered into clo&s;er con|nections with the king of Corea, who was nearly related to the Chine&s;e emperor, had &s;ome old &s;cores to &s;et|tle with Japan, and becau&s;e he de|&s;ired tho&s;e di&s;putes might be ami|cably compromi&s;ed in the general pa|cification, had been gro&s;sly in&s;ulted by Taycho, in the per&s;on of his am|ba&s;&s;ador. He had for &s;ome time dreaded the ambition of the Japo|ne&s;e mini&s;try, which &s;eemed to aim at univer&s;al empire; and he was, moreover, &s;timulated by this outrage
<PB N="93" REF="94">
to conclude a defen&s;ive alliance with the emperor of China; a mea&s;ure which all the caution of the two courts could not wholly conceal from the knowledge of the Japone&s;e poli|ticians.</P>
<P>Mean while a dreadful cloud big with ruin and di&s;grace &s;eemed to ga|ther round the head of Brut-an-tiffi. The Mantchoux Tartars, &s;en&s;ible of the inconvenience of their di&s;tant &s;ituation from the &s;cene of action, which render|ed it impo&s;&s;ible for them to carry on their operations vigorou&s;ly in conjunc|tion with the O&s;trog, re&s;olved to &s;ecure winter-quarters in &s;ome part of the enemy's territories, from whence they &s;hould be able to take the field, and act again&s;t him early in the &s;pring. With this view they be&s;ieged and took a frontier fortre&s;s belonging to Brut-an-tiffi, &s;ituated upon a great inland lake which extended as far as the capital of the Mantchoux, who were thus enabled to &s;end thither by
<PB N="94" REF="95">
water-carriage all &s;orts of provi&s;ions and military &s;tores for the u&s;e of their army, which took up their win|ter-quarters accordingly in and about this new acqui&s;ition. It was now that the ruin of Brut-an-tiffi &s;eemed inevitable. Orator Taycho &s;aw with horror the precipice to the brink of which his dear ally was driven. Not that his fears were actuated by &s;ym|pathy or friend&s;hip. Such emotions had never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the heart of Tay|cho. No; he trembled becau&s;e he &s;aw his own popularity connected with the fate of the Tartar. It was the &s;ucce&s;s and petty triumphs of this adventurer which had dazzled the eyes of the blatant bea&s;t, &s;o as to di&s;order its judgment, and prepare it for the illu&s;ions of the Orator: but, now that Fortune &s;eemed ready to turn tail to Brut-an-tiffi, and leave him a prey to his adver&s;aries, Tay|cho knew the di&s;po&s;itions of the
<PB N="95" REF="96">
mon&s;ter &s;o well as to progno&s;ticate that its applau&s;e and affection would be immediately turned into grum|bling and di&s;gu&s;t; and that he him|&s;elf, who had led it blindfold into this unfortunate connexion, might po&s;|&s;ibly fall a &s;acrifice to its re&s;entment, provided he could not immediate|ly project &s;ome &s;cheme to divert its attention, and transfer the blame from his own &s;houlders.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he employed his invention, and &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. Having called a council of the Twenty-eight, at which the Dairo a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on, he propo&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that a &s;trong &s;quadron of Fune &s;hould be immediately ordered to &s;cour the &s;eas, and kidnap all the ve&s;&s;els and &s;hips belonging to the king of Corea, who had acted during the whole war with the mo&s;t &s;candalous partiality in favour of the Chine&s;e emperor, and was now &s;o intimately connected
<PB N="96" REF="97">
with that potentate, by means of a &s;ecret alliance, that he ought to be pro&s;ecuted with the &s;ame ho&s;tilities which the other had &s;everely felt. The whole council were confounded at this propo&s;al: the Dairo &s;tood agha&s;t: the Cuboy trembled: Yak-&s;trot &s;tared like a &s;kewered pig. Af|ter &s;ome pau&s;e, the pre&s;ident Soo|&s;an-&s;in-o ventured to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;ure &s;eemed to be a little abrupt and premature: that the na|tion was already engaged in a very expen&s;ive war, which had ab&s;olute|lutely drained it of its wealth, and even loaded it with enormous debts; therefore little able to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch additional burthens as would, in all probability, be occa&s;ioned by a rup|ture with a prince &s;o rich and power|ful. Gotto-mio &s;wore the land holders were already &s;o impoveri&s;hed by the exactions of Taycho, that he him|&s;elf, ere long, &s;hould be obliged to
<PB N="97" REF="98">
upon the pari&s;h. Fika-kaka got up to &s;peak; but could only cackle. Sti-phi-rum-poo was for proceeding in form by citation. Nin-kom-poo-po declared he had good intelli|gence of a fleet of merchant-&s;hips belonging to Corea, laden with trea|&s;ure, who were then on their return from the Indian i&s;les; and he gave it as his opinion, that they &s;hould be way-laid and brought into the har|bours of Japan; not by way of de|claring war, but only with a view to prevent the money's going into the coffers of the Chine&s;e emperor. Fokh-&s;i-rokhu &s;tarted two objections to this expedient: fir&s;t, the uncertainty of falling in with the Corean fleet at &s;ea, alledging as an in&s;tance the di&s;|appointment and mi&s;carriage of the &s;quadron which the Sey-&s;eo-gun had &s;ent &s;ome years ago to intercept the Chine&s;e Fune on the coa&s;t of Fat-&s;i&s;io: &s;econdly, the lo&s;s and hard&s;hip
<PB N="98" REF="99">
it would be to many &s;ubjects of Japan who dealt in commerce, and had great &s;ums embarked in tho&s;e very Corean bottoms. Indeed Fokh-&s;i-rokhu him&s;elf was intere&s;ted in this very commerce. The Fatz-man &s;at &s;ilent. Yak-&s;trot, who had &s;ome roman|tic notions of honour and hone&s;ty, repre&s;ented that the nation had al|ready incurred the cen&s;ure of all its neighbours, by &s;eizing the merchant|&s;hips of China, without any previ|ous declaration of war: that the law of nature and nations, confirmed by repeated treaties, pre&s;cribed a more honourable method of proceeding, than that of plundering like robbers, the &s;hips of pacific merchants, who trade on the faith of &s;uch laws and &s;uch treaties: he was, therefore, of opinion, that if the king of Corea had in any &s;hape deviated from the neutrality which he profe&s;&s;ed, &s;atis|faction &s;hould be demanded in the
<PB N="99" REF="100">
u&s;ual form; and when that &s;hould be refu&s;ed, it might be found nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to compul&s;ive mea&s;ures. The Dairo acquie&s;ced in this ad|vice, and a&s;&s;ured Taycho that an amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould be forthwith di&s;|patched to Corea, with in&s;tructions to demand an immediate and &s;atis|factory explanation of that prince's conduct and de&s;igns with regard to the empire of Japan.</P>
<P>This regular method of practice would by no means &s;uit the purpo&s;es of Taycho, who rejected it with great in|&s;olence and di&s;dain. He bit his thumb at the pre&s;ident; forked out his fingers on his forehead at Gotto-mio; wag|ged his under-jaw at the Cuboy; &s;napt his fingers at Sti-phi-rum-poo; grinned at the Sey-&s;eo-gun; made the &s;ign of the cro&s;s or gallows to Fokh-&s;i-rokhu; then turning to Yak|&s;trot, he clapped his thumbs in his ears, and began to bray like an a&s;s:
<PB N="100" REF="101">
finally, pulling out the badge of his office, he threw it at the Dairo, who in vain intreated him to be pacified; and wheeling to the right-about, &s;talked away, &s;lapping the flat of his hand upon a certain part that &s;hall be namele&s;s. He was followed by his kin&s;man the Quo Lob-kob, who wor&s;hipped him with the mo&s;t hum|ble adoration. He now imitated this great original in the &s;ignal from behind at parting, and in him it was attended by a rumbling &s;ound; but whether this was the effect of contempt or compunction, I could never learn.</P>
<P>Taycho having thus carried his point, which was to have a pre|tence for quitting the reins of go|vernment, made his next appeal to the blatant bea&s;t. He reminded the many-headed mon&s;ter of the unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;s which had attended his admini&s;tration; of his having &s;upported the glorious Brut-an-tiffi,
<PB N="101" REF="102">
the great bulwark of the religion of Bupo, who had kept the common enemy at bay, and filled all A&s;ia with the fame of his victories. He told them, that for his own part, he pre|tended to have &s;ubdued Fat&s;i&s;io in the heart of Tartary: that he de&s;pi&s;|ed honours, and had &s;till a greater contempt for riches; and that all his endeavours had been &s;olely exerted for the good of his country, which was now brought to the very verge of de&s;truction. He then gave the bea&s;t to under&s;tand that he had form|ed a &s;cheme again&s;t the king of Co|rea, which would not only have di&s;|abled that monarch from executing his ho&s;tile intentions with re&s;pect to Japan, but al&s;o have indemnified this nation for the whole expence of the war; but that his propo&s;al having been rejected by the council of Twenty-eight, who were influencd by Yak-&s;trot, a Ximian mountaineer

without &s;pirit or under&s;tanding, he had re&s;igned his office with intention to retire to &s;ome &s;olitude, where he &s;hould in &s;ilence deplore the misfor|tunes of his country, and the ruin of the Buponian religion, which mu&s;t fall of cour&s;e with its great protector Brut|an-tiffi, whom he fore&s;aw the new mini&s;try would immediately abandon.</P>
<P>This addre&s;s threw Legion into &s;uch a qnandary, that it rolled it|&s;elf in the dirt, and yelled hide|ou&s;ly. Mean while the Orator re|treating to a cell in the neighbour|hood of Meaco, hired the common crier to go round the &s;treets and pro|claim that Taycho, being no longer in a condition to afford any thing but the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life, would by public &s;ale di&s;po&s;e of his ambling mule and furniture, together with an ermined robe of his wife, and the greater part of his kitchen uten&s;ils. At this time he was well known
<PB N="103" REF="104">
to be worth upwards of twenty thou|&s;and gold Obans; neverthele&s;s, the Mobile di&s;charging this circum&s;tance entirely from their reflection, attend|ed to nothing but the object which the Orator was plea&s;ed to pre&s;ent. They thought it was a piteous ca&s;e, and a great &s;candal upon the govern|ment, that &s;uch a patriot, who had &s;aved the nation from ruin and di&s;|grace, &s;hould be reduced to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling his mule and his hou&s;hold furniture. Accordingly they rai&s;ed a clamour that &s;oon rung in the ears of Gio-gio and his favourite.</P>
<P>It was &s;uppo&s;ed that Mura-clami &s;ugge&s;ted on this occa&s;ion to his countryman Yak-&s;trot, the hint of offering a pen&s;ion to Taycho, by way of remuneration for his pa&s;t &s;ervices. <Q REND="inline">"If he refu&s;es it, (&s;aid he) the offer will at lea&s;t reflect &s;ome credit upon the Dairo and the admini&s;tration; but, &s;hould he accept of it, (which is
<PB N="104" REF="105">
much more likely) it will either &s;top his mouth entirely, or expo&s;e him to the cen&s;ure of the people, who now adore him as a mirrour of di&s;intere&s;t|ed integrity."</Q> The advice was in|&s;tantly complied with: the Dairo &s;igned a patent for a very ample pen|&s;ion to Taycho and his heirs; which patent Yak-&s;trot delivered to him next day at his cell in the country. This miracle of patrioti&s;m received the bounty as a turnpike-man re|ceives the toll, and then &s;lapped his door full in the face of the favourite: yet, nothing of what Mura-clami had progno&s;ticated, came to pa&s;s. The many-tailed mon&s;ter, far from calling in que&s;tion the Orator's di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s, con&s;idered his accept|ance of the pen&s;ion as a proof of his moderation, in receiving &s;uch a tri|fling reward for the great &s;ervices he had done his country; and the ge|nero&s;ity of the Dairo, in&s;tead of ex|citing
<PB N="105" REF="106">
the lea&s;t emotion of gratitude in Taycho's own brea&s;t, acted only as a golden key to unlock all the &s;luices of his virulence and abu&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, he kept within bounds until he &s;hould &s;ee what would be the fate of Brut-an-tiffi, who now &s;eemed to be in the condi|tion of a criminal at the foot of the ladder. In this dilemma, he obtained a very unexpected reprieve. Before the army of the Mantchoux could take the lea&s;t advantage of the &s;ettle|ment they had made on his fron|tiers, their empre&s;s died, and was &s;uc|ceeded by a weak prince, who no &s;ooner a&s;cended the throne than he &s;truck up a peace with the Tartar freebooter, and even ordered his troops to join him again&s;t the O&s;trog, to whom they had hitherto-acted as auxiliaries. Such an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength would have ca&s;t the balance
<PB N="106" REF="107">
greatly in his favour, had not Provi|dence once more interpo&s;ed, and brought matters again to an equi|librium.</P>
<P>Taycho no &s;ooner perceived his ally thus unexpectedly delivered from the dangers that &s;urrounded him, than he began to repent of his own re&s;igna|tion; and re&s;olved once more, to force his way to the helm, by the &s;ame means he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed before. He was, indeed, of &s;uch a turbulent di&s;po&s;ition as could not reli&s;h the repo&s;e of private life, and his &s;pirit &s;o corro&s;ive, that it would have preyed upon him&s;elf, if he could not have found external food for it to devour. He therefore began to pre|pare his engines, and provide proper emi&s;&s;aries to be&s;patter, and rai&s;e a hue-and-cry again&s;t Yak-&s;trot at a convenient &s;ea&s;on; not doubting but an occa&s;ion would &s;oon pre&s;ent it&s;elf, con&s;idering the temper, inexperience, and prejudices of this Ximian poli|tician,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
together with the pacific &s;y&s;tem he had adopted, &s;o contrary to the pre&s;ent &s;pirit of the blatant bea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the&s;e preparations he was much comforted and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his kin&s;man and pupil Lob-kob, who entered into his mea&s;ures with &s;urprizing zeal; and had the good luck to light on &s;uch in&s;truments as were admirably &s;uited to the work in hand. Yak-&s;trot was extremely plea&s;ed at the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of Taycho, who had been a very trouble&s;ome collegue to him in the admini&s;tra|tion, and run counter to all the &s;chemes he had projected for the good of the empire. He now found him&s;elf at liberty to follow his own inventions, and being naturally an enthu&s;ia&s;t, believed him&s;elf born to be the &s;aviour of Japan. Some efforts, however, he made to acquire popula|rity, proved fruitle&s;s. Perceiving the people were, by the Orator's in&s;tiga|tions,
<PB N="108" REF="109">
exa&s;perated again&s;t the king of Corea, he &s;ent a peremptory me&s;&s;age to that prince demanding a categorical an&s;wer; and this being denied, de|clared war again&s;t him, according to the practice of all civilized nations: but even this mea&s;ure failed of ob|taining that approbation for which it was taken. The mon&s;ter, tutored by Taycho and his mini&s;ters, exclaimed, that the golden opportunity was lo&s;t, ina&s;much as, during the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s forms, the trea&s;ures of Corea were &s;afely brought home to that kingdom; trea&s;ures which, had they been interrupted by the Fune of Japan, would have payed off the debts of the nation, and enabled the inhabi|tants of Meaco to pave their &s;treets with &s;ilver. By the bye, this trea|&s;ure exi&s;ted no where but in the fic|tion of Taycho and the imagination of the blatant bea&s;t, which never at|tempted to u&s;e the evidence of &s;en&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="110">
on rea&s;on to examine any a&s;&s;ertion, how ab&s;urd and improbable &s;oever it might be, which proceeded from the mouth of the Orator.</P>
<P>Yak-&s;trot, having now taken upon him&s;elf the ta&s;k of &s;teering the political bark, re&s;olved to &s;hew the Japone&s;e, that altho' he recommended peace, he was as well qualified as his predece&s;|&s;or for conducting the war. He there|fore, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Fatz|man, projected three naval enterprizes; the fir&s;t again&s;t Thin-quo, the con|que&s;t of which had been un&s;ucce&s;s|fully attempted by Taycho; the &s;e|cond was de&s;tined for the reduction of Fan-yah, one of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable &s;ettlements belonging to the king of Corea, in the Indian ocean; and the third armament was &s;ent to plunder and de&s;troy a flouri&s;hing colony called Lli-nam, which the &s;ame prince had e&s;tabli&s;hed almo&s;t as far to the &s;outhward as the Terra
<PB N="110" REF="111">
Au&s;tralis Incognita. Now the only merit which either Yak-&s;trot, or any other mini&s;ter could ju&s;tly claim from the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch expeditions, is that of adopting the mo&s;t fea&s;ible of tho&s;e &s;chemes which are pre&s;ent|ed by different projectors, and of ap|pointing <HI>&s;uch</HI> commanders as are ca|pable of conducting them with vi|gour and &s;agacity.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep which the favourite took was to provide a help-mate for the young Dairo; and a certain Tartar prin|ce&s;s of the religion of Bupo, being pitched upon for this purpo&s;e, was formally demanded, brought over to Niphon, e&s;pou&s;ed by Gio-gio, and in|&s;talled empre&s;s with the u&s;ual &s;olemni|ties. But, le&s;t the choice of a Tartarian prince&s;s &s;hould &s;ubject the Dairo to the imputation of inheriting his pre|dece&s;&s;or's predilection for the land of Ye&s;&s;o, which had given &s;uch &s;en|&s;ible umbrage to all the &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="111" REF="112">
Japone&s;e who made u&s;e of their own rea&s;on; he determined to detach his ma&s;ter gradually from tho&s;e conti|nental connexions, which had been the &s;ource of &s;uch enormous expence, and &s;uch continual vexation to the em|pire of Japan. In the&s;e &s;entiments, he with-held the annual tribute which had been lately payed to Brut-an-tiffi; by which means he &s;aved a very con|&s;iderable &s;um to the nation, and, at the &s;ame time, re&s;cued it from the infamy of &s;uch a di&s;graceful impo&s;i|tion.&mdash;He expected the thanks of the public for this exertion of his influence in favour of his country; but he reckoned without his ho&s;t. What he flattered him&s;elf would yield him an abundant harve&s;t of ho|nour and applau&s;e, produced nothing but odium and reproach, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures, pur&s;ued with an eye to the advantage of the public,
<PB N="112" REF="113">
which &s;eemed to argue a con&s;ider|able &s;hare of &s;pirit and capacity, were &s;trangely chequered with others of a more dome&s;tic nature, which &s;avoured &s;trongly of childi&s;h vanity, ra&s;h ambi|tion, littlene&s;s of mind, and lack of under&s;tanding. He purcha&s;ed a va&s;t ward-robe of tawdry cloaths, and flut|tered in all the finery of Japan: he pre|vailed upon his ma&s;ter to ve&s;t him with the badges and trappings of all the honorary in&s;titutions of the empire, altho' this multiplication of orders in the per&s;on of one man, was altogether without precedent or pre|&s;cription. This was only &s;etting him&s;elf up as the more con&s;picuous mark for envy and detraction.</P>
<P>Not contented with engro&s;&s;ing the per&s;onal favour and confidence of his &s;overeign, and, in effect, directing the whole machine of government, he thought his fortune &s;till imperfect, while the trea&s;ure of the empire pa&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="113" REF="114">
through the hands of the Cuboy, enabling that mini&s;ter to maintain a very exten&s;ive influence, which might one day interfere with his own. He therefore employed all his invention, together with that of his friends, to find out &s;ome &s;pecious pretext for removing the old Cuboy from his office; and in a little time accident afforded what all their intrigues had not been able to procure.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the demi&s;e of Got-hama-baba, poor Fika-kaka had been &s;ub|ject to a new &s;et of vagaries. The death of his old ma&s;ter gave him a rude &s;hock: then the new Dairo encroached upon his province, by preferring a Bonze without his con&s;ent or know|ledge: finally, he was prevented by the expre&s;s order of Gio-gio from touch|ing a certain &s;um out of the trea&s;ury, which he had been accu&s;tomed to throw out of his windows at &s;tated pe|periods,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
in order to keep up an intere&s;t among the dregs of the people. All the&s;e mortifications had an effect upon the weak brain of the Cuboy. He be|gan to loath his u&s;ual food, and &s;ome|times even declined &s;hewing him&s;elf to the Bonzes at his levee; &s;ymptoms that alarmed all his friends and depen|dants. In&s;tead of frequenting the a&s;&s;emblies of the great, he now at|tended a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly at all groanings and chri&s;tenings, grew extremely fond of caudle, and held conferences with practitioners, both male and fe|male, in the art of midwifry. When bu&s;ine&s;s or ceremony obliged him to vi&s;it any of the Quos or Quanbukus of Meaco; he, by a &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tinct, ran directly to the nur&s;ery, where, if there happened to be a child in the cradle, he took it up, and if it was foul, wiped it with great care and &s;eeming &s;atisfaction. He, more|over,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
learned of the good women to &s;ing lullabies, and practi&s;ed them with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s: but the mo&s;t extravagant of all his whims, was what he exhibited one day in his own court-yard. Ob&s;erving a ne&s;t with &s;ome eggs, which the goo&s;e had quitted, he forthwith dropped his trow&s;ers, and &s;quatting down in the at|titude of incubation, began to &s;tretch out his neck, to hi&s;s and to cackle, as if he had been really metamorpho&s;ed into the animal who&s;e place he now &s;upplied.</P>
<P>It was on the back of this adven|ture that one of the Bonzes, as pry|ing, and as great a go&s;&s;ip as the barber of Midas, in paying his morn|ing wor&s;hip to the Cuboy's po&s;teri|ors, &s;pied &s;omething, or rather no|thing, and was exceedingly affright|ed. He communicated his di&s;co|very and apprehen&s;ion to divers others of the cloth; and they were all of
<PB N="116" REF="117">
opinion that &s;ome effectual inqui|&s;ition &s;hould be held on this phaenomenon, le&s;t the clergy of Japan &s;hould hereafter be &s;canda|lized, as having knowingly ki&s;&s;ed the breech of an old woman, perhaps a mon&s;ter or magician. Informa|tion was accordingly made to the Dairo, who gave orders for imme|diate in&s;pection; and Fika-kaka was formally examined by a jury of ma|trons. Whether the&s;e were actuated by undue influence, I &s;hall not at pre|&s;ent explain; certain it is, they found their verdict, The Cuboy <HI>non mas;</HI> and among other evidences produced to atte&s;t his metamorpho&s;is, a certain Ximian, who pretended to have the &s;econd &s;ight, made oath that he had one evening &s;een the &s;aid Fika-ka|ka in a female dre&s;s, riding through the air on a broom-&s;tick. The un|happy Cuboy being thus convicted, was dive&s;ted of his office, and con|fined
<PB N="117" REF="118">
to his palace in the country; while Gio-gio, by the advice of his favourite, publi&s;hed a proclamation, declaring it was not for the honour of Japan that her trea&s;ury &s;hould be managed either by a witch or an old woman.</P>
<P>Fika-kaka being thus removed, Yak-&s;trot was appointed trea&s;urer and Cuboy in his place, and now ruled the roa&s;t with uncontrouled authority. On the very thre&s;hold of his greatne&s;s, however, he made a fal&s;e &s;tep, which was one cau&s;e of his tottering, during the whole &s;equel of his admini&s;tration. In order to refute the calumnies and defeat the intrigues of Taycho in the a&s;&s;emblies of the people, he cho&s;e as an a&s;&s;ociate in the mini&s;try Fokh-&s;i|rokhu, who was at that in&s;tant the mo&s;t unpopular man in the whole empire of Japan; and at the in&s;ti|gation of this collegue, deprived of
<PB N="118" REF="119">
bread a great number of poor fami|lies, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on petty places which had been be&s;towed upon them by the former Cuboy. Tho&s;e were &s;o many mouths opened to augment the clamour again&s;t his own per&s;on and admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It might be imagined, that while he thus &s;et one part of the nation at defiance, he would endeavour to cul|tivate the other; and, in particular, &s;trive to conciliate the good-will of the nobility, who did not &s;ee his exaltation without umbrage. But, in&s;tead of ingratiating him&s;elf with them by a liberal turn of demea|nour; by treating them with frankne&s;s and affability; granting them favours with a good grace; making entertain|ments for them at his palace; and mixing in their &s;ocial parties of plea|&s;ure; Yak-&s;trot always appeared on the re&s;erve, and under all his finery, continually wore a doublet of buck|ram,
<PB N="119" REF="120">
which gave an air of &s;tiffne&s;s and con&s;traint to his whole behaviour. He &s;tudied po&s;tures, and, in giving audience, generally &s;tood in the atti|tude of the idol Fo; &s;o that he &s;ome|times was mi&s;taken for an image of &s;tone. He formed a &s;cale of ge&s;ticu|lation in a great variety of divi&s;ions, comprehending the &s;lighte&s;t inclinati|on of the head, the front-nod, the &s;ide-nod, the bow, the half, the &s;emi-demi-bow, with the &s;huffle, the &s;lide, the circular, &s;emi-circular, and quadrant &s;weep of the right foot. With equal care and preci&s;ion did he model the oeconomy of his looks into the divi|&s;ions and &s;ub-divi&s;ions of the full|&s;tare, the &s;ide-glance, the pen&s;ive look, the pouting look, the gay look, the vacant look, and the &s;tolid look. To the&s;e different expre&s;&s;ions of the eye he &s;uited the corre&s;ponding fea|tures of the no&s;e and mouth; &s;uch as the wrinkled no&s;e, the retorted
<PB N="120" REF="121">
no&s;e, the &s;neer, the grin, the &s;imper, and the &s;mile. All the&s;e po&s;tures and ge&s;ticulations he practi&s;ed, and di&s;tributed occa&s;ionally, according to the difference of rank and impor|tance of the various individuals with whom he had communication.</P>
<P>But the&s;e affected airs being a&s;&s;um|ed in de&s;pite of nature, he appeared as aukward as a native of Angola, when he is fir&s;t hampered with cloaths; or a Highlander, obliged by act of parliament to wear breeches.&mdash;In|deed, the di&s;tance ob&s;erved by Yak|&s;trot in his behaviour to the nobles of Niphon, was imputed to his be|ing con&s;cious of a &s;ulphureous &s;mell which came from his own body; &s;o that greater familiarity on his &s;ide might have bred contempt. He took delight in no other conver&s;a|tion but that of two or three ob&s;cure Ximians, his companions and coun|&s;ellors, with whom he &s;pent all his

lei&s;ure time, in conferences upon po|litics, patrioti&s;m, philo&s;ophy, and the Belles Lettres. Tho&s;e were the ora|cles he con&s;ulted in all the emergen|cies of &s;tate; and with the&s;e he &s;pent many an Attic evening.</P>
<P>The gods, not yet tired of &s;porting with the farce of human govern|ment, were &s;till re&s;olved to &s;hew by what incon&s;iderable &s;prings a mighty empire may be moved. The new Cuboy was va&s;tly well di&s;po&s;ed to make his Ximian favourites great men. It was in his power to be|&s;tow places and pen&s;ions upon them; but it was not in his power to give them con&s;equence in the eyes of the public. The admini&s;tration of Yak|&s;trot could not fail of being propi|tious to his own family, and poor relations, who were very numerous. Their naked backs and hungry bel|lies were now clothed with the rich|e&s;t &s;tuffs, and fed with the fat things
<PB N="122" REF="123">
of Japan. Every department civil and military was filled with Ximi|ans. Tho&s;e i&s;landers came over in &s;hoals to Niphon, and &s;warmed in the &s;treets of Meaco, where they were ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by their lank &s;ides, gaunt looks, lanthorn|jaws, and long &s;harp teeth.&mdash;There was a fatality that attended the whole conduct of this unfortunate Cuboy. His very partiality to his own countrymen, brought upon him at la&s;t the cur&s;es of the whole clan.</P>
<P>Mr. Orator Taycho and his kin&s;|man Lob-kob were not idle in the mean time. They provided their emi&s;&s;aries, and primed all their en|gines. Their under&s;trappers filled every corner of Meaco with rumours, jealou&s;ies, and &s;u&s;picions. Yak-&s;trot was repre&s;ented as a &s;tate&s;man with|out di&s;cernment, a mini&s;ter without knowledge, and a man without hu|manity. He was taxed with in&s;up|portable
<PB N="123" REF="124">
pride, indi&s;cretion, pu&s;illa|nimity, rapacity, partiality, and breach of faith. It was affirmed that he had di&s;honoured the nation, and endangered the very exi&s;tence of the Buponian religion, in withdraw|ing the annual &s;ub&s;idy from the great Brut-an-tiffi: that he wanted to &s;tarve the war, and betray the glory and advantage of the empire by a &s;hameful peace: that he had avow|edly &s;hared his admini&s;tration with the greate&s;t knave in Japan: that he treated the nobles of Niphon with in&s;olence and contempt: that he had &s;uborned evidence again&s;t the antient Cuboy Fika-kaka, who had &s;pent a long life and an immen&s;e fortune in &s;upporting the temple of Fak-ku-ba&s;i: that he had cruelly turned adrift a great number of helple&s;s families, in order to gratify his own worthle&s;s dependants with their &s;poils: that he had enriched his relations and
<PB N="124" REF="125">
countrymen with the plunder of Ni|phon: that his intention was to bring over the whole nation of Ximians, a &s;avage race, who had been ever per|fidious, greedy, and ho&s;tile towards the natives of the other Japone&s;e i&s;lands. Nay, they were de&s;cribed as mon&s;ters in nature, with cloven feet, long tails, &s;aucer eyes, iron fangs and claws, who would fir&s;t de|vour the &s;ub&s;tance of the Niphonites, and then feed upon their blood.</P>
<P>Taycho had Legion's under&s;tand|ing &s;o much in his power, that he actually made it believe Yak-&s;trot had formed a trea&s;onable &s;cheme in favour of a foreign adventurer who pretended to the throne of Japan, and that the reigning Dairo was an accom|plice in this project for his own de|po&s;ition. Indeed, they did not &s;cru|ple to &s;ay that Gio-gio was no more than a puppet moved by his own grandmother and this vile Ximian,
<PB N="125" REF="126">
between whom they hinted there was a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence which reflected very little honour on the family of the Dairo.</P>
<P>Mr. Orator Taycho and his a&s;&s;o|ciate Lob-kob left no &s;tone unturned to di&s;grace the favourite, and drive him from the helm. They &s;truck up an alliance with the old Cuboy Fika-kaka, and fetching him from his retirement, produced him to the bea&s;t as a martyr to loyalty and vir|tue. They had often before this period, expo&s;ed him to the deri&s;ion of the populace; but now they &s;et him up as the object of veneration and e&s;teem; and every thing &s;uc|ceeded to their wi&s;h. Legion hoi&s;t|ed Fika-kaka on his back, and pa|raded through the &s;treets of Meaco, braying hoar&s;e encomiums on the great talents and great virtues of the antient Cuboy. His cau&s;e was now e&s;pou&s;ed by his old friends Sti|phi-rum-poo
<PB N="126" REF="127">
and Nin-kom-poo-poo, who had been turned adri&s;t along with him, and by &s;everal other Quos who had ne&s;tled them&s;elves in warm places under the &s;hadow of his protection: but it was remark|able, that not one of all the Bonzes who owed their preferment to his favour, had gratitude enough to &s;ol|low his fortune, or pay the lea&s;t re|&s;pect to him in the day of his di&s;|grace.&mdash;Advantage was al&s;o taken of the di&s;gu&s;t occa&s;ioned by Yak-&s;trot's re&s;erve among the nobles of Japan. Even the Fatz-man was e&s;tranged from the councils of his kin&s;man Gio|gio, and lent his name and counte|nance to the malcontents, who now formed them&s;elves into a very for|midable cabal, comprehending a great number of the fir&s;t Quos in the empire.</P>
<P>In order to counterballance this confederacy, which was a &s;trange co|alition

of jarring intere&s;ts, the new Cuboy endeavoured to &s;trengthen his admini&s;tration, by admitting into a &s;hare of it Gotto-mio, who dreaded nothing &s;o much as the continuation of the war, and divers other noblemen, who&s;e alliance contributed very lit|tle to his intere&s;t or advantage. Got|to-mio was univer&s;ally envied for his wealth, and dete&s;ted for his avarice: the re&s;t were either of the She-it|kum-&s;heit-el faction, which had been long in di&s;grace with the Mobile; or men of de&s;perate fortunes and loo&s;e morals, who attached them&s;elves to the Ximian favourite &s;olely on ac|count of the po&s;ts and pen&s;ions he had to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>During the&s;e dome&s;tic commo|tions, the arms of Japan continued to pro&s;per in the Indian ocean. Thin|quo was reduced almo&s;t without op|po&s;ition; and news arrived that the conque&s;t of Fan-yah was already

more than half atchieved. At the &s;ame time, &s;ome con&s;iderable advan|tages were gained over the enemy on the continent of Tartary, by the Ja|pone&s;e forces under the command of Bron-xi-tic. It might be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e events would have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, reconciled the Niphonites to the new mini&s;try: but they produced rather a contrary effect. The blatant bea&s;t was re&s;olv|ed to rejoice at no victories but tho&s;e that were obtained under the au&s;pi|ces of its beloved Taycho; and now took it highly ami&s;s that Yak-&s;trot &s;hould pre&s;ume to take any &s;tep which might redound to the glory of the empire. Nothing could have plea&s;ed the mon&s;ter at this juncture &s;o much as the mi&s;carriage of both expedi|tions, and a certain information that all the troops and &s;hips employed in them had mi&s;erably peri&s;hed. The king of Corea, however, was &s;o
<PB N="129" REF="130">
alarmed at the progre&s;s of the Ja|pone&s;e before Fan-yah, that he be|gan to tremble for all his di&s;tant co|lonies, and earne&s;tly craved the ad|vice of the cabinet of Pekin touch|ing &s;ome &s;cheme to make a diver&s;ion in their favour.</P>
<P>The councils of Pekin have been ever fruitful of intrigues to embroil the re&s;t of A&s;ia. They &s;ugge&s;ted a plan to the king of Corea, which he forthwith put in execution. The land of Fumma, which borders on the Corean territories, was governed by a prince nearly allied to the king of Corea, although his &s;ubjects had very intimate connexions in the way of commerce with the empire of Japan, which, indeed, had entered into an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alli|ance with this country. The em|peror of China and the king of Co|rea having &s;ounded the &s;overeign of Fumma, and found him well di&s;po&s;|ed
<PB N="130" REF="131">
to enter into their mea&s;ures, com|municated their &s;cheme, in which he immediately concurred. They call|ed upon him in public, as their friend and ally, to join them again&s;t the Japone&s;e, as the inveterate enemy of the religion of Fo, and as an in&s;olent people, who affect|ed a de&s;poti&s;m at &s;ea, to the detri|ment and de&s;truction of all their neighbours; plainly declaring that he mu&s;t either immediately break with the Dairo, or expect an inva|&s;ion on the &s;ide of Corea. The prince of Fumma affected to complain loudly of this iniquitous propo&s;al; he made a merit of rejecting the alter|native; and immediately demanded of the court of Meaco, the &s;uccours &s;tipulated in the treaty of alliance, in order to defend his dominions. In all appearance, indeed, there was no time to be lo&s;t; for the monarchs of China and Corea declared war again&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="132">
him without further he&s;itation; and uniting their forces on that &s;ide, or|dered them to enter the land of Fum|ma, after having given &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urances in private, that the prince had nothing to fear from their ho&s;|tilities.</P>
<P>Yak-&s;trot was not much embar|ra&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion. Without &s;u&s;pecting the lea&s;t collu&s;ion among the parties, he re&s;olved to take the prince of Fumma under his pro|tection, thereunto moved by divers con&s;iderations. Fir&s;t and foremo&s;t, he piqued him&s;elf upon his good faith: &s;econdly, he knew that the trade with Fumma was of great con&s;equence to Japan; and therefore concluded that his &s;upporting the &s;o|vereign of it would be a popular mea&s;ure: thirdly, he hoped that the multiplication of expence incurred by this new war, would make the blatant bea&s;t wince under its burden,
<PB N="132" REF="133">
and of con&s;equence reconcile it to the thoughts of a general pacifica|tion, which he had very much at heart. Mean while he ha&s;tened the nece&s;&s;ary &s;uccours to the land of Fumma, and &s;ent thither an old ge|neral called Le-yaw-ter, in order to concert with the prince and his mi|ni&s;ters the operations of the cam|paign.</P>
<P>This officer was counted one of the &s;hrewde&s;t politicians in Japan, and having re&s;ided many years as amba&s;&s;ador in Fumma, was well ac|quainted with the genius of that people. He immediately di&s;covered the &s;cene which had been acted be|hind the curtain. He found that the prince of Fumma, far from having made any preparations for his own defence, had actually withdrawn his garri&s;ons from the frontier places, which were by this time peaceably occupied by the invading army of
<PB N="133" REF="134">
Chine&s;e and Coreans: that the few troops he had, were without cloaths, arms, and di&s;cipline; and that he had amu&s;ed the court of Meaco with fal&s;e mu&s;ters, and a &s;pecious ac|count of levies and preparations which had been made. In a word, though he could not learn the particulars, he comprehended the whole my&s;tery of the &s;ecret negotiations. He up|braided the mini&s;ter of Fumma with per&s;idy, refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume the com|mand of the Japone&s;e auxiliaries when they arrived, and returning to Meaco, communicated his di&s;cove|ries and &s;u&s;picions to the new Cu|boy. But he did not meet with that reception which he thought he de|&s;erved for intelligence of &s;uch impor|tance. Yak-&s;trot affected to doubt; perhaps, he was not really convinced; or, if he was, thought proper to tem|porize; and he was in the right for &s;o doing. A rupture with Fumma
<PB N="134" REF="135">
at this juncture, would have forced the prince to declare openly for the enemies of Japan; in which ca&s;e the inhabitants of Niphon would have lo&s;t the benefit of a very advanta|geous trade. They had already been great &s;ufferers in commerce by the breach with the king of Corea, who&s;e &s;ubjects had been u&s;ed to take off great quantities of the Ja|pone&s;e manufactures, for which they payed in gold and &s;ilver; and they could ill bear &s;uch an additional lo&s;s as an interruption of the trade with Fumma would have occa&s;ioned. The Cuboy, therefore, continued to treat the prince of that country as a &s;taunch ally, who had &s;acrificed every other con&s;ideration to his good faith; and, far from re&s;tricting him&s;elf to the number of troops and Fune &s;tipu|lated in the treaty, &s;ent over a much more numerous body of &s;orces and &s;hips of war; declaring, at the &s;ame
<PB N="135" REF="136">
time, he would &s;upport the people of Fumma with the whole power of Japan.</P>
<P>Such a con&s;iderable diver&s;ion of the Japone&s;e &s;trength could not fail to an&s;wer, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the ex|pectation of the two &s;overeigns of China and Corea; but it did not prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedi|tions which were actually employed again&s;t their colonies in the Indian ocean. It was not in his power, however, to protect Fumma, had the invaders been in earne&s;t: but the combined army of the Chine&s;e and Coreans had orders to protract the war; and, in&s;tead of penetrating to the capital, at a time when the Fum|mians, tho' joined with the auxi|liaries of Japan, were not numerous enough to look them in the face, they made a full-&s;top in the middle of their march, and quietly retired into &s;ummer quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
The additional incumbrance of a new continental war, redoubled the Cuboy's de&s;ire of peace; and his in|clination being known to the ene|my, who were al&s;o &s;ick of the war, they had recour&s;e to the good offices of a certain neutral power, called Sab-oi, &s;overeign of the moun|tains of Cambodia. This prince ac|cordingly offered his mediation at the court of Meaco, and it was immedi|ately accepted.&mdash;The negotiation for peace, which had been broke off in the mini&s;try of Taycho, was now re|&s;umed; an amba&s;&s;ador plenipotentiary arrived from Pekin; and Gotto-mio was &s;ent thither in the &s;ame ca|pacity, in order to adju&s;t the ar|ticles, and &s;ign the preliminaries of peace.</P>
<P>While this new treaty was on the carpet, the armament equipped again&s;t Fan-yah under the command of the Quo Kep-marl, and the brave
<PB N="137" REF="138">
admiral, who had &s;ignalized him|&s;elf in the &s;ea of Kamt&s;chatka, re|duced that important place, where they became ma&s;ters of a &s;trong &s;qua|dron of Fune belonging to the king of Corea, together with a very con&s;i|derable trea&s;ure, &s;ufficient to indem|nify Japan for the expence of the expedition. This, though the mo&s;t grievous, was not the only di&s;a&s;ter which the war brought upon the Coreans. Their di&s;tant &s;ettlement of Lli-nam was likewi&s;e taken by general Tra-rep, and the inhabitants payed an immen&s;e &s;um in order to redeem their capital from plun|der.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es did not at all re|tard the conclu&s;ion of the treaty, which was indeed become equally nece&s;&s;ary to all the parties concerned. Japan, in particular, was in danger of being ruined by her conque&s;ts. The war had de&s;troyed &s;o many
<PB N="138" REF="139">
men, that the whole empire could not afford a &s;ufficiency of recruits for the maintenance of the land-forces. All tho&s;e who had conquered Fat|&s;i&s;io and Fan-yah, were already de|&s;troyed by hard duty and the di&s;ea&s;es of tho&s;e unhealthy climates: above two-thirds of the Fune were rotten in the cour&s;e of &s;ervice; and the complements of mariners reduced to le&s;s than one half of their original numbers. Troops were actually want|ing to garri&s;on the new conque&s;ts. The finances of Japan were by this time drained to the bottom. One of her chief re&s;ources was &s;topped by the rupture with Corea; while her expences were con&s;iderably augment|ed; and her national credit was &s;tretched even to cracking. All the&s;e con&s;iderations &s;timulated more and more the Dairo and his Cuboy to conclude the work of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
Mean while the enemies of Yak|&s;trot gave him no quarter nor re&s;|pite. They vilified his parts, tra|duced his morals, endeavoured to in|timidate him with threats which did not even re&s;pect the Dairo, and ne|ver failed to in&s;ult him whenever he appeared in public. It had been the cu&s;tom, time immemorial, for the chief magi&s;trate of Meaco to make an entertainment for the Dairo and his empre&s;s, immediately after their nuptials, and to this banquet all the great Quos in Japan were invited. The per&s;on who filled the chair at pre&s;ent, was Rhum-kikh, an half-witted politician, &s;elf-con|ceited, head-&s;trong, turbulent, and ambitious; a profe&s;&s;ed wor&s;hipper of Taycho, who&s;e oratorial talents he admired, and attempted to imi|tate in the a&s;&s;emblies of the people, where he generally excited the laughter of his audience. By dint
<PB N="140" REF="141">
of great wealth and exten&s;ive traf|fick he became a man of con&s;e|quence among the mob, notwith|&s;tanding an illiberal turn of mind, and an ungracious addre&s;s; and now he re&s;olved to u&s;e this influence for the glory of Taycho and the di&s;grace of the Ximian favourite. Legion was tutored for the purpo&s;e, and moreover, well primed with a fiery cau&s;tic &s;pirit in which Rhum-kikh was a con&s;iderable dealer. The Dairo and his young empre&s;s were received by him and his council with a &s;ul|len formality in profound &s;ilence. The Cuboy was pelted as he pa&s;&s;ed along, and his litter almo&s;t over|turned by the mon&s;ter, which yelled, and brayed, and hooted without cea&s;|ing, until he was hou&s;ed in the ci|ty-hall, where he met with every &s;ort of mortification from the en|tertainer as well as the &s;pectators. At length Mr. Orator Taycho, with
<PB N="141" REF="142">
his cou&s;in Lob-kob, appearing in a triumphal car at the city-gate, the blatant bea&s;t received them with loud huzzas, unharne&s;&s;ed their hor&s;es, and putting it&s;elf in the traces, drew them through the &s;treets of Meaco, which re&s;ounded with acclamation. They were received with the &s;ame exultation within the hall of enter|tainment, where their &s;overeign and his con&s;ort &s;at altogether unhonoured and unnoticed.</P>
<P>A &s;mall &s;quadron of Chine&s;e Fune having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a defencele&s;s fi&s;hery belonging to Ja|pan, in the neighbourhood of Fat|&s;i&s;io, the emi&s;&s;aries of Taycho mag|nified this event into a terrible misfortune, ari&s;ing from the mal|admini&s;tration of the new Cuboy: nay, they did not &s;cruple to affirm, that he had left the fi&s;hing-town de|fencele&s;s on purpo&s;e that it might be taken by the enemy. This cla|mour,
<PB N="142" REF="143">
however, was of &s;hort dura|tion. The Quo Phyl-Kholl, who commanded a few Fune in one of the harbours of Fat&s;i&s;io, no &s;ooner re|ceived intelligence of what had hap|pened, than he embarked what troops were at hand, and &s;ailing directly to the place, obliged the enemy to aban|don their conque&s;t with precipita|tion and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the peace was &s;igned, ratified, and even approved in the great national council of the Quos, as well as in the a&s;&s;embly of the people. The truth is, the mini&s;ter of Japan has it always in his power to &s;ecure a majority in both the&s;e conventions, by means that may be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed; and tho&s;e were not &s;pared on this occa&s;ion. Yak-&s;trot, in a &s;peech, harangued the great council, who were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him &s;peak with &s;uch propriety and
<PB N="143" REF="144">
extent of knowledge; for he had been repre&s;ented as tongue-tied, and in point of elocution, little better than the palfrey he rode. He now vindicated all the &s;teps he had taken &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the helm: he demon&s;trated the nece&s;&s;ity of a paci|fication; explained and de&s;canted upon every article of the treaty; and finally, declared his con&s;cience was &s;o clear in this matter, that when he died, he &s;hould de&s;ire no other en|comium to be engraved on his tomb, but that he was the author of this peace.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the approbation of the council was not obtained with|out violent debate and altercation. The different articles were cen&s;ured and inveighed again&s;t by the Fatz|man, the late Cuboy Fika-kaka, Lob-kob, Sti-phi-rum-poo, Nin-kom-poo-poo, and many other Quos; but, at the long-run, the influence
<PB N="144" REF="145">
of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try predominat|ed. As for Taycho, he exerted him|&s;elf in a very extraordinary effort to depreciate the peace in the a&s;&s;embly of the people. He had for &s;ome days pretended to be dangerou&s;ly ill, that he might make a merit of his patrioti&s;m by &s;hewing a contempt for his own life, when the good of his country was at &s;take. In order to excite the admiration of the pub|lic, and render his appearance in the a&s;&s;embly the more &s;triking, he was carried thither on a kind of hand|barrow, wrapped up in flannel, with three woollen night-caps on his head, efcorted by Legion, which yelled, and brayed, and whooped, and hol|lowed, with &s;uch vociferation, that every &s;treet of Meaco rung with hideous clamour. In this equipage did Taycho enter the a&s;&s;embly, where, being held up by two adherents, he, after a prelude of groans to rou&s;e the
<PB N="145" REF="146">
attention of his audience, began to declaim again&s;t the peace as inade|quate, &s;hameful, and di&s;advantageous: nay, he ventured to &s;tigmatize every &s;eparate article, though he knew it was in the power of each individual of his hearers, to confront him with the terms to which he had &s;ub&s;crib|ed the preceding year, in all re&s;pects le&s;s honourable and advantageous to his country. Incon&s;i&s;tencies equally glaring and ab&s;urd he had often crammed down the throats of the multitude: but they would not go down with this a&s;&s;embly of the peo|ple, which, in &s;pite of his flannel, his night-caps, his crutches, and his groans, confirmed the treaty of peace by a great majority. Not that they had any great rea&s;on to applaud the peace-makers, who might have dic|tated their own terms, had they proceeded with more &s;agacity and le&s;s precipitation. But Fokh-&s;i|rokhu
<PB N="146" REF="147">
and his brother undertakers, having the trea&s;ure of Japan at their command, had anointed the greate&s;t part of the a&s;&s;embly with a certain precious &s;alve, which pre&s;erved them effectually from the fa&s;cinating arts of Taycho.</P>
<P>This Orator, incen&s;ed at his bad &s;ucce&s;s within doors, renewed and redoubled his operations without. He exa&s;perated Legion agan&s;t Yak-&s;trot to &s;uch a pitch of rage, that the mon&s;ter could not hear the Cuboy's name three times pronounced with|out falling into fits. His confede|rate Lob-kob, in the cour&s;e of his re|&s;earches, found out two originals ad|mirably calculated for executing his vengeance again&s;t the Ximian fa|vourite. One of them, called Llur|chir, a profligate Bonze, degraded for his lewd life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a won|derful talent of exciting different pa&s;&s;ions in the blatant bea&s;t, by dint
<PB N="147" REF="148">
of quaint rhimes, which were &s;aid to be in&s;pirations of the daemon of obloquy, to whom he had &s;old his &s;oul. The&s;e oracles not only com|manded the pa&s;&s;ions, but even in|fluenced the organs of the bea&s;t in &s;uch a manner, as to occa&s;ion an evacuation either upwards or down|wards, at the plea&s;ure of the operator. The other, known by the name of Jan-ki-dtzin, was counted the be&s;t mark&s;man in Japan in the art and my&s;tery of dirt-throwing. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of making balls of filth, which were famous for &s;tick|ing and &s;tinking; and the&s;e he threw with &s;uch dexterity, that they very &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed their aim. Being re|duced to a low ebb of fortune by his debaucheries, he had made advances to the new Cuboy, who had rejected his proffered &s;ervices, on account of his immoral character: a prudi&s;h punctilio, which but ill became Yak-&s;trot, who had payed very little re|gard
<PB N="148" REF="149">
to reputation in choo&s;ing &s;ome of the colleagues he had a&s;&s;ociated in his admini&s;tration. Be that as it may, he no &s;ooner under&s;tood that Mr. Orator Taycho was bu&s;y in pre|paring for an active campaign, than he likewi&s;e began to put him&s;elf in a  po&s;ture of defence. He hired a body of mercenaries, and provided &s;ome dirt-men and rhymers. Then, taking the field, a &s;harp conte&s;t and pelting-match en&s;ued: but the di&s;|pute was &s;oon terminated. Yak-&s;trot's ver&s;ifiers turned out no great conjurers, on the trial. They were not &s;uch favourites of the daemon as Llur-chir. The rhimes they u&s;ed, produced no other effect upon Le|gion, but that of &s;etting it a-bray|ing. The Cuboy's dirt-men, how|ever, played their parts tolerably well. Though their balls were in|ferior in point of compo&s;ition to tho&s;e of Jan-ki-dtzin, they did not fail to di&s;compo&s;e Orator Taycho and
<PB N="149" REF="150">
his friend Lob-kob, who&s;e eyes were &s;een to water with the &s;mart occa|&s;ioned by tho&s;e mi&s;&s;iles: but the&s;e la&s;t had a great advantage over their adver&s;aries, in the zeal and attach|ment of Legion, who&s;e numerous tongues were always ready to lick off the ordure that &s;tuck to any part of their leaders; and this they did with &s;uch &s;igns of &s;atisfaction, as &s;eemed to indicate an appetite for all manner of filth.</P>
<P>Yak-&s;trot having &s;uffered wo&s;ully in his own per&s;on, and &s;eeing his parti&s;ans in confu&s;ion, thought pro|per to retreat. Yet, although di&s;|comfited, he was not di&s;couraged. On the contrary, having at bottom a fund of fanatici&s;m which, like ca|momile, grows the fa&s;ter for being trod upon, he became more ob&s;tinately bent than ever upon pro&s;ecuting his own &s;chemes for the good of the people in their own de&s;pite. His
<PB N="150" REF="151">
vanity was likewi&s;e buoyed up by the flattery of his creatures, who ex|tolled the pa&s;&s;ive courage he had &s;hewn in the late engagement. Tho' every part of him &s;till tingled and &s;tunk from the balls of the enemy, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf that not one of their mi&s;&s;iles had taken place; and of con&s;equence, that there was &s;ome|thing of divinity in his per&s;on. Full of this notion, he di&s;carded his rhym|&s;ters and his dirt-ca&s;ters as unnece&s;|&s;ary, and re&s;olved to bear the brunt of the battle in his own individual.</P>
<P>Fokh-&s;i-rokhu advi&s;ed him, ne|verthele&s;s, to fill his trow&s;ers with gold Obans, which he might throw at Legion in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, a&s;&s;ur|ing him that this was the only am|munition which the mon&s;ter could not with&s;tand. The advice was good; and the Cuboy might have followed it, without being obliged to the trea|&s;ury of Japan; for he was by this
<PB N="151" REF="152">
time become immen&s;ely rich, in con&s;equence of having found a hoard in digging his garden: but this was an expedient which Yak-&s;trot could never be prevailed upon to u&s;e, either on this or any other occa&s;ion. In|deed, he was now &s;o convinced of his own per&s;onal energy, that he per&s;uaded his ma&s;ter Gio-gio to come forth and &s;ee it operate on the bla|tant bea&s;t. Accordingly the Dairo a&s;cended his car of &s;tate, while the Cuboy, arrayed in all his trappings, &s;tood before him with the reins in his own hand, and drove directly to the enemy, who waited for him without flinching. Being arrived within dung-&s;hot of Jan-ki-dtzin, he made a halt, and putting him&s;elf in the attitude of the idol Fo, with a &s;imper in his countenance, &s;eemed to invite the warrior to make a full di&s;charge of his artillery. He did not long wait in &s;u&s;pence. The balls &s;oon
<PB N="152" REF="153">
began to whizz about his ears; and a great number took effect upon his per&s;on. At length, he received a &s;hot upon his right temple which brought him to the ground. All his gewgaws fluttered, and his buck|ram doublet rattled as he fell. Llur-chir no &s;ooner beheld him pro&s;|trate, than advancing with the mon|&s;ter, he began to repeat his rhymes, at which every mouth and every tail of Legion was opened and li&s;t|ed up; and &s;uch a torrent of filth &s;quirted from the&s;e channels, that the unfortunate Cuboy was quite overwhelmed. Nay, he mu&s;t have been actually &s;uffocated where he lay, had not &s;ome of the Dairo's at|tendants interpo&s;ed and re&s;cued him from the vengeance of the mon|&s;ter. He was carried home in &s;uch an un&s;avoury pickle, that his family &s;melled his di&s;a&s;ter long before he came in &s;ight; and when he appear|ed
<PB N="153" REF="154">
in this woeful condition, cover|ed with ordure, blinded with dirt, and even deprived of &s;en&s;e and mo|tion, his wife was &s;eized with <HI>hy&s;|terica pa&s;&s;io.</HI> He was immediately &s;tripped and wa&s;hed, and other means being u&s;ed for his recovery, he in a little time retrieved his recol|lection.</P>
<P>He was now pretty well unde|ceived, with re&s;pect to the divinity of his per&s;on: but his enthu&s;ia&s;m took a new turn. He a&s;pired to the glory of martyrdom, and re&s;olved to devote him&s;elf as a victim to patri|otic virtue. While his attendants were employed in wa&s;hing off the filth that &s;tuck to his beard, he recited in a theatrical tone, the &s;tanza of a famous Japone&s;e bard, who&s;e &s;oul afterwards tran&s;migrated into the body of the Roman poet Horatius Flaccus, and in&s;pired him

<P>His friends hearing him declare his re&s;olution of dying for his coun|try, began to fear that his under|&s;tanding was di&s;turbed. They ad|vi&s;ed him to yield to the torrent, which was become too impetuous to &s;tem; to re&s;ign the Cuboy&s;hip quietly, and re&s;erve his virtues for a more favourable occa&s;ion. In vain his friends remon&s;trated: in vain his wife and children employed their tears and intreaties to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e. He lent a deaf ear to all their &s;ollicitations, until they began to drop &s;ome hints that &s;eemed to im|ply
<PB N="155" REF="156">
a &s;u&s;picion of his in&s;anity, which alarmed him exceedingly; and the Dairo him&s;elf &s;ignifying to him in pri|vate, that it was become ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to temporize, he re&s;igned the reins of government with a heavy heart, though not before he was a&s;&s;ured that he &s;hould &s;till continue to exert his influence behind the curtain,</P>
<P>Gio-gio's own per&s;on had not e&s;caped untouched in the la&s;t &s;kir|mi&s;h. Jan-ki-dtzin was tran&s;ported to &s;uch a pitch of in&s;olence, that he aimed &s;ome balls at the Dairo, and one of them taking place exactly betwixt the eyes, defiled his whole vi&s;age. Had the laws of Japan been executed in all their &s;everi|ty again&s;t this audacious plebeian, he would have &s;uffered crucifixion on the &s;pot: but Gio-gio, being good-natured even to a fault, con|tented him&s;elf with ordering &s;ome
<PB N="156" REF="157">
of his attendants to apprehend and put him in the public &s;tocks, after having &s;eized the whole cargo of filth which he had collected at his habitation for the manufacture of his balls. Legion was no &s;ooner informed of his di&s;grace, than it re|lea&s;ed him by force, being therein comforted and abetted by the de|claration of a puny magi&s;trate, cal|led Praff-patt-phogg, who &s;eized this, as the only opportunity he &s;hould ever find of giving him&s;elf any con&s;equence in the common|wealth. Accordingly, the mon&s;ter hoi&s;ting him and Jan-ki-dtzin on their &s;houlders, went in proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets of Meaco, hol|lowing, huzzaing, and extolling this venerable pair of patriots as the <HI>Pal|ladia</HI> of the liberty of Japan.</P>
<P>The mon&s;ter's officious zeal on this occa&s;ion, was far from being agreeable to Mr. Orator Taycho,
<PB N="157" REF="158">
who took umbrage at this exalta|tion of his two under&s;trappers, and from that moment devoted Jan-ki-dtzin to de&s;truction. The Dairo finding it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of his government, that this dirt-monger &s;hould be puni&s;h|ed, gave directions for trying him according to the laws of the land. He was ignominiou&s;ly expelled from the a&s;&s;embly of the people, where his old patron Taycho not only di&s;|claimed him, but even repre&s;ented him as a worthle&s;s athei&s;t and &s;ower of &s;edition: but he e&s;caped the weight of a more &s;evere &s;entence in another tribunal, by retreating without beat of drum, into the ter|ritories of China, where he found an a&s;ylum, from whence he made divers ineffectual appeals to the mul|titudinous bea&s;t at Niphon.</P>
<P>As for Yak-&s;trot, he was every thing but a down-right martyr to
<PB N="158" REF="159">
the odium of the public, which pro|duced a ferment all over the nation. His name was become a term of reproach. He was burnt or cruci|fied in effigy in every city, town, village, and di&s;trict of Niphon. Even his own countrymen, the Ximians, held him in abhorrence and execra|tion. Notwith&s;tanding his parti|ality to the <HI>natale &s;olum,</HI> he had not been able to provide for all tho&s;e adventurers who came from thence in con&s;equence of his promo|tion. The whole number of the di&s;appointed became his enemies of cour&s;e; and the re&s;t finding them|&s;elves expo&s;ed to the animo&s;ity and ill offices of their fellow-&s;ubjects of Niphon, who hated the whole com|munity for his &s;ake, inveighed again&s;t Yak-&s;trot as the cur&s;e of their na|tion.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this dete&s;tation and di&s;grace, it mu&s;t be owned for
<PB N="159" REF="160">
the &s;ake of truth, that Yak-&s;trot was one of the hone&s;te&s;t men in Japan, and certainly the greate&s;t benefactor to the empire. Ju&s;t, up|right, &s;incere, and charitable; his heart was &s;u&s;ceptible of friend&s;hip and tenderne&s;s. He was a virtu|ous hu&s;band, a fond father, a kind ma&s;ter, and a zealous friend. In his public capacity he had nothing in view but the advantage of Japan, in the pro&s;ecution of which he flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould be able to di&s;play all the abilities of a pro|found &s;tate&s;man, and all the virtues of the mo&s;t &s;ublime patrioti&s;m. It was here he over-rated his own im|portance. His virtue became the dupe of his vanity. Nature had de|nied him &s;hining talents, as well as that ea&s;ine&s;s of deportment, that af|fability, liberal turn, and ver&s;atile genius, without which no man can ever figure at the head of an admi|ni&s;tration.
<PB N="160" REF="161">
Nothing could be more ab&s;urd than his being charged with want of parts and under&s;tanding to guide the helm of government, con&s;idering how happily it had been conducted for many years by Fika-kaka, who&s;e natural genius would have been found unequal even to the art and my&s;tery of wool-combing. Be&s;ides, the war had pro&s;pered in his hands as much as it ever did under the au&s;pices of his predece&s;&s;or; though, as I have be|fore ob&s;erved, neither the one nor the other could ju&s;tly claim any merit from its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But Yak-&s;trot's &s;ervices to the public, were much more important in another re&s;pect. He had the re&s;olution to di&s;&s;olve the &s;hameful and pernicious engagements which the empire had contracted on the continent of Tartary. He lightened the intolerable burthens of the em|pire:
<PB N="161" REF="162">
he &s;aved its credit when it was &s;tretched even to bur&s;ting. He made a peace, which, if not the mo&s;t glorious that might have been ob|tained, was, at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;olid and advantageous that ever Japan had concluded with any power what|&s;oever; and, in particular, much more honourable, u&s;eful, and a&s;cer|tained, than that which Taycho had agreed to &s;ub&s;cribe the preced|ing year; and, by this peace, he put an end to all the horrors of a cruel war, which had ravaged the be&s;t parts of A&s;ia, and de&s;troyed the lives of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men every year. On the whole, Yak-&s;trot's good qualities were re&s;pect|able. There was very little vi|cious in his compo&s;ition; and as to his follies, they were rather the &s;ubjects of ridicule than of re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163">
Yak-&s;trot's &s;ubalterns in the mi|ni&s;try, rejoiced in &s;ecret at his running &s;o far into the north of Legion's di&s;|plea&s;ure. Nay, it was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;|pected that &s;ome of their emi&s;&s;aries had been very active again&s;t him in the day of his di&s;comfiture. They flattered them&s;elves, that if he could be effectually driven from the pre|&s;ence of the Dairo, they would &s;uc|ceed to his influence; and in the mean time would acquire popularity by turning tail to, and kicking at, the Ximian favourite, who had a&s;&s;o|ciated them in the admini&s;tration in con&s;equence of their vowing eternal attachment to his intere&s;t, and con|&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will. Having held a &s;ecret conclave to concert their operations, they began to exe|cute their plan, by &s;educing Yak-&s;trot into certain odious mea&s;ures of rai&s;ing new impo&s;itions on the peo|ple, which did not fail, indeed, to
<PB N="163" REF="164">
increa&s;e the clamour of the blatant Bea&s;t, and promote its filthy di&s;|charge upwards and downwards; but then the torrents were divided, and many a tail was lifted up again&s;t the real projectors of the &s;cheme which the favourite had adopted. They now re&s;olved to make a merit with the Mobile, by picking a ger|man quarrel with Strot, and in&s;ult|ing him in public. Gotto-mio cau&s;ed a &s;crubbing-po&s;t to be &s;et up in the night, at the Cuboy's door.&mdash;The &s;cribe Zan-ti-fic pre&s;ented him with a &s;cheme for the importation of brim&s;tone into the i&s;land of Ximo: the other &s;cribe pretended he could not &s;pell the barbarous names of the Cuboy's relations and countrymen, who were daily thru&s;t into the mo&s;t lucrative employments. As for Twitz-er the Financier, he never approached Yak-&s;trot without claw|ing his knuckles in deri&s;ion. At the
<PB N="164" REF="165">
council of Twenty-Eight, they thwarted every plan he propo&s;ed, and turned into ridicule every word he &s;poke. At length they bluntly told the Dairo, that as Yak-&s;trot re|&s;igned the reins of admini&s;tration in public, he mu&s;t likewi&s;e give up his management behind the curtain; for they were not at all di&s;po&s;ed to an&s;wer to the people for mea&s;ures dictated by an invi&s;ible agent. This was but a rea&s;onable demand, in which the emperor &s;eemed to ac|quie&s;ce. But the new mini&s;ters thought it was requi&s;ite that they &s;hould commit &s;ome overt act of contempt for the abdicated Cuboy. One of his neare&s;t relations had ob|tained a profitable office in the i&s;land of Ximo; and of this, the new ca|bal in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould be immediate|ly deprived. The Dairo remon&s;trated again&s;t the inju&s;tice of turning a man out of his place for no other
<PB N="165" REF="166">
rea&s;on but to &s;atisfy their caprice; and plainly told them he could not do it without infringing his honour, as he had given his word that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hould enjoy the po&s;t for life. Far from being &s;atisfied with this declaration, they urged their de|mand with redoubled importunity, mixed with menaces which equally embarra&s;&s;ed and incen&s;ed the good|natured Dairo. At la&s;t Yak-&s;trot, taking compa&s;&s;ion upon his indul|gent ma&s;ter, prevailed upon his kin&s;man to relea&s;e him from the obligation of his word, by making a voluntary re&s;ignation of his office. The Dairo fell &s;ick of vexation: his life was de&s;paired of; and all Japan was filled with alarm and ap|prehen&s;ion at the pro&s;pect of an in|fant's a&s;cending the throne: for the heir apparent was &s;till in the cradle.</P>
<P>Their fears, however, were hap|pily di&s;appointed by the recovery of
<PB N="166" REF="167">
the emperor, who, to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible the inconvenien|ces that might attend his demi&s;e, during the minority of his &s;on, re|&s;olved that a regency &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and ratified by the &s;tates of the empire. The plan of this re|gency he concerted in private with the venerable prince&s;s his grand|mother, and his friend Yak-&s;trot; and then communicated the de&s;ign to his mini&s;ters, who knowing the quarter from whence it had come, treated it with coldne&s;s and con|tempt. They were &s;o elevated by their la&s;t triumph over the Ximian favourite, that they overlooked eve|ry ob&s;tacle to their ambition; and determined to render the Dairo de|pendant on them, and them only. With this view they threw cold water on the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure; and to mark their hatred of the fa|vourite more &s;trongly in the eyes of
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Legion, they endeavoured to exclude the name of his patrone&s;s the Dairo's grandmother, from the deed of re|gency, though their malice was fru&s;|trated by the vigilance of Yak-&s;trot, and the indignation of the &s;tates, who re&s;ented this affront offered to the family of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The tyranny of this junto became &s;o intolerable to Gio-gio, that he re|&s;olved to &s;hake off their yoke, what|ever might be the con&s;equence: but before any effectual &s;tep was taken for this purpo&s;e, Yak-&s;trot, who un|der&s;tood mechanics, and had &s;tudi|ed the art of puppet-playing, tried an experiment on the organs of the cabal, which he tempered with in|dividually without &s;ucce&s;s. In&s;tead of uttering what he prompted, the &s;ounds came out quite altered in their pa&s;&s;age. Gotto-mio grunted; the Fi|nancier Twitz-er bleated, or rather brayed; one &s;cribe mewed like a
<PB N="168" REF="169">
cat; the other yelped like a jack|all. In &s;hort, they were found &s;o perver&s;e and refractory, that the ma|&s;ter of the motion kicked them off the &s;tage, and &s;upplied the &s;cene with a new &s;et of puppets made of very extraordinary materials. They were the very figures through who&s;e pipes the charge of mal-admini&s;tra|tion had been &s;o loudly &s;ounded again&s;t the Ximian favourite. They were now mu&s;tered by the Fatzman, and hung upon the pegs of the very &s;ame puppet-&s;hew-man again&s;t whom they had &s;o vehemently inveighed. Even the &s;uperannuated Fika-kaka ap|peared again upon the &s;tage as an actor of &s;ome con&s;equence; and in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that his metamorpho&s;is was a meer calumny. But Taycho and Lob-kob kept aloof, becau&s;e Yak-&s;trot had not yet touched them on the proper keys.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
The fir&s;t exhibition of the new puppets, was called <HI>Top&s;y-turvy,</HI> a farce in which they overthrew all the paper hou&s;es which their pre|dece&s;&s;ors had built: but they per|formed their parts in &s;uch confu|&s;ion, that Yak-&s;trot interpo&s;ing to keep them in order, received divers contu&s;ions and &s;evere kicks on the &s;hins, which made his eyes water; and, indeed, he had in a little time rea&s;on enough to repent of the re|volution he had brought about. The new &s;ticks of admini&s;tration proved more &s;tiff and unmanageable than the former; and tho&s;e he had di&s;|carded, a&s;&s;ociating with the blatant Bea&s;t, bedaubed him with &s;uch a variety of filth, drained from all the &s;ewers of &s;currility, that he really became a public nui&s;ance. Gotto-mio pretended remor&s;e of con&s;cience, and declared he would impeach Yak-&s;trot for the peace
<PB N="170" REF="171">
which he him&s;elf had negotiated. Twitz-er &s;nivelled and cried, and ca&s;t figures to prove that Yak-&s;trot was born for the de&s;truction of Japan; and Zan-ti-fic lured an incendiary Bonze called Toks, to throw fire-balls by night into the palace of the favourite.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s Strot ca&s;t his eyes on Taycho the mon&s;ter|tamer, who alone &s;eemed able to over-ballance the weight of all other oppo&s;ition; and to him he made large advances accordingly; but his of|fers were &s;till inadequate to the ex|pectations of that Demagogue, who, neverthele&s;s, put on a face of capitu|lation. He was even heard to &s;ay that Yak-&s;trot was an hone&s;t man and a good mini&s;ter: nay, he declared he would a&s;cend the highe&s;t pin|nacle of the highe&s;t pagod in Japan, and proclaim that Yak-&s;trot had ne|ver, directly nor indirectly, meddled with admini&s;tration &s;ince he re&s;ign|ed
<PB N="171" REF="172">
the public office of mini&s;ter. Finding him, however, tardy and phlegmatic in his propo&s;als, he thought proper to change his phra&s;e, and in the next a&s;&s;embly of the peo|ple &s;wore, with great vociferation, that the &s;aid Yak-&s;trot was the greate&s;t rogue that ever e&s;caped the gallows. This was a nece&s;&s;ary fillip to Yak-&s;trot, and operated upon him &s;o effectu|ally, that he forthwith &s;ent a charte blanche to the great Taycho, and a treaty was immediately ratified on the following conditions: That the &s;aid Taycho &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the rank of Quanbuku, and be appointed con&s;ervator of the Dairo's &s;ignet: that no &s;tate mea&s;ure &s;hould be taken without his expre&s;s approbation: that his creature the lawyer Praff|fog &s;hould be ennobled and prefer|red to the mo&s;t eminent place in the tribunals of Japan; and that all his friends and dependants &s;hould be
<PB N="172" REF="173">
provided for at the public expence, in &s;uch a manner as he him&s;elf &s;hould propo&s;e. His kin&s;man Lob-kob, however, was not comprehended in this treaty, the articles of which he inveighed again&s;t with &s;uch acri|mony, that a rupture en&s;ued betwixt the&s;e two originals. The truth is, Lob-kob was now &s;o full of his own importance, that nothing le&s;s than an equal &s;hare of admini&s;tration would &s;atisfy his ambition; and this was neither in Taycho's power nor inclination to grant.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;equence of this treaty was a new &s;hift of hands, and a new dance of mini&s;ters. The chair of pre|cedency was pulled from under the antiquated Fika-kaka, who fell upon his back; and his heels flying up, di&s;covered but too plainly the melan|choly truth of his metamorpho&s;is. All his colleagues were di&s;carded, except tho&s;e who thought proper to
<PB N="173" REF="174">
temporize and join in dancing the hay, according as they were actu|ated by the new partners of the pup|pet-&s;hew. This coalition was the greate&s;t ma&s;ter-piece in politics that ever Yak-&s;trot performed. Taycho, the formidable Taycho! whom in his &s;ingle per&s;on he dreaded more than all his other enemies of Japan united, was now become his coadju|tor, abettor, and advocate; and, which was &s;till of more con&s;equence to Strot, that Demagogue was for&s;aken of his good genius Legion.</P>
<P>The many-headed Mon&s;ter would have &s;wallowed down every other &s;pecies of tergiver&s;ation in Taycho, except a coalition with the dete&s;ted favourite, and the title of Quo, by which he formally renounced its &s;o|ciety: but the&s;e were articles which the mongrel could not dige&s;t. The tidings of this union threw the Bea&s;t into a kind of &s;tupor, from which it
<PB N="174" REF="175">
was rou&s;ed by bli&s;ters and cauteries applied by Gotto-mio, Twitz-er, Zan-ti-fic, with his under&s;trapper Toks, now reinforced by Fika-kaka, and his di&s;carded a&s;&s;ociates: for their common hatred to Yak-&s;trot, like the rod of Mo&s;es, &s;wallowed up every di&s;tinction of party, and every &s;ug|ge&s;tion of former animo&s;ity; and they concurred with incredible zeal, in rou&s;ing Legion to a due &s;en&s;e of Taycho's apo&s;tacy. The Bea&s;t, &s;o &s;ti|mulated, howled three days and three nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at Taycho's gate; then was &s;eized with a convul&s;ion, that went off with an evacuation upwards and downwards, &s;o offen|&s;ive, that the very air was infected.</P>
<P>The horrid &s;ounds of the Bea&s;t's lamentation, the noxious effluvia of its filthy di&s;charge, joined to the poignant remor&s;e which Taycho felt at finding his power over Legion di&s;&s;olved, occa&s;ioned a com|motion
<PB N="175" REF="176">
in his brain; and this led him into certain extravagancies, which gave his enemies a handle to &s;ay he was actually in&s;ane. His former friends and partizans thought the be&s;t apology they could make for the incon&s;i&s;tency of his conduct, was to &s;ay he was <HI>non compos;</HI> and this report was far from being di&s;agree|able to Yak-&s;trot, becau&s;e it would at any time furni&s;h him with a plau|&s;ible pretence to di&s;&s;olve the partner|&s;hip, at which he inwardly repined: for it was nece&s;&s;ity alone that drove him to a partition of his power with a man &s;o incapable of acting in con|cert with any collegue what&s;oever.</P>
<P>In the mean time Gotto-mio and his a&s;&s;ociates left no &s;tone unturned to acquire the &s;ame influence over Le|gion, which Taycho had &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but the Bea&s;t's faculties, &s;lender as they were, &s;eemed now greatly impaired, in con&s;equence of
<PB N="176" REF="177">
that arch empiric's practices upon its con&s;titution. In vain did Gotto-mio hoop and hollow: in vain did Twitz-er tickle its long ears: in vain did Zan-ti-fic apply &s;ternutatories, and his Bonze admini&s;ter inflammatory gly&s;ters; the mon&s;ter could never be brought to a right under&s;tanding, or at all concur with their de&s;igns, ex|cept in one in&s;tance, which was its antipathy to the Ximian favourite. This had become &s;o habitual, that it acted mechanically upon its organs, even after it had lo&s;t all other &s;igns of recognition. As often as the name of Yak-&s;trot was pronounced, the Bea&s;t began to yell; and all the u&s;ual con&s;equences en&s;ued: but when|ever his new friends pre&s;umed to mount him, he threw him&s;elf on his back, and rolled them in the kennel at the hazard of their lives.</P>
<P>One would imagine there was &s;ome leaven in the nature of Yak|&s;trot,
<PB N="177" REF="178">
that &s;oured all his &s;ubalterns who were natives of Niphon; for how|&s;oever they promi&s;ed all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will before they were admit|ted into his motion, they no &s;ooner found them&s;elves acting characters in his drama, than they began to thwart him in his mea&s;ures; &s;o that he was plagued by tho&s;e he had taken in, and per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e he had driven out. The two great props which he had been at &s;o much pains to pro|vide, now failed him. Taycho was grown crazy, and could no longer manage the mon&s;ter; and Quam-ba|cundono the Fatzman, who&s;e autho|rity had kept &s;everal puppets in awe, died about this period. The&s;e two circum&s;tances were the more alarm|ing, as Gotto-mio and his crew be|gan to gain ground, not only in their endeavours to rou&s;e the Mon&s;ter, but al&s;o in tampering with &s;ome of the acting puppets, to join their cabal
<PB N="178" REF="179">
and make head again&s;t their ma&s;ter. The&s;e exoterics grew &s;o refractory, that when he tried to wheel them to the right, they turned to the left about; and, in&s;tead of joining hands in the dance of politics, rapped their heads again&s;t each other with &s;uch violence, that the noi&s;e of the colli|&s;ion was heard in the &s;treet; and if they had not been made of the hard|e&s;t wood in Japan, &s;ome of them would certainly have been &s;plit in the encounter.</P>
<P>By this time Legionbegan to have &s;ome &s;en&s;e of its own mi&s;erable condi|tion. The effects of the yea&s;t potions which it had drank &s;o liberally from the hands of Taycho, now wore off. The fumes di&s;per&s;ed; the illu&s;ion va|ni&s;hed; the flatulent tumor of its bel|ly di&s;appeared with innumerable ex|plo&s;ions, leaving a hideous lankne&s;s and &s;uch a canine appetite as all the eatables of Japan could not &s;atisfy.
<PB N="179" REF="180">
After having devoured the whole harve&s;t, it yawned for more, and grew quite outrageous in its hunger, threatening to feed on human fle&s;h, if not plentifully &s;upplied with other viands. In this dilemma Yak-&s;trot convened the council of Twenty-Eight, where, in con&s;ideration of the urgency of the ca&s;e, it was re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend the law again&s;t the im|portation of foreign provi&s;ions, and open the ports of Japan for the relief of the blatant Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>As this was ve&s;ting the Dairo with a di&s;pen&s;ing power unknown to the con&s;titution of Japan, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary at the next a&s;&s;em|bly of the Quos and Quanbukus that con&s;titute the legi&s;lature, to obtain a legal &s;anction for that extraordinary exerci&s;e of prerogative, which nothing but the <HI>&s;alus populi</HI> could excu&s;e. Up|on this occa&s;ion it was diverting to &s;ee with what effrontery individuals
<PB N="180" REF="181">
changed their principles with their places. Taycho the Quo, happen|ing to be in one of his lucid inter|vals, went to the a&s;&s;embly, &s;upport|ed by his two creatures Praff-fog, and another limb of the law, called Lley-nah, &s;urnamed Gurg-grog, or Cur&s;e-mother; and this triumvirate, who had rai&s;ed them&s;elves from no|thing to the fir&s;t rank in the &s;tate, by vilifying and in&s;ulting the kingly power, and affirming that the Dairo was the &s;lave of the people, now had the impudence to declare in the face of day, that in &s;ome ca&s;es the empe|ror's power was ab&s;olute, and that he had an inherent right to &s;u&s;pend and &s;uper&s;ede the laws and ordinances of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Mura-clami, who had been for &s;ome time eclip&s;ed in his judicial capacity by the popularity of Praff-fog, did not fail to &s;eize this opportunity of ex|po&s;ing the character of his up&s;tart rival.
<PB N="181" REF="182">
Though he had been all his life an humble retainer to the prerogative, he now made a parade of patrioti&s;m, and in a tide of eloquence bore down all the flim&s;y arguments which the triumvirate advanced. He demon|&s;trated the futility of their rea&s;oning, from the expre&s;s laws and cu&s;toms of the empire; he expatiated on the pernicious tendency of their doctrine, and exhibited the incon&s;i&s;tency of their conduct in &s;uch colours, that they mu&s;t have hid their heads in confu&s;ion, had they not happily con|quered all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and been well convinced that the majority of the a&s;&s;embly were not a whit more hone&s;t than them&s;elves. Mura-cla|mi enjoyed a momentary triumph; but his words made a very &s;light impre&s;&s;ion; for it was his misfor|tune to be a Ximian; and if his vir|tues had been more numerous than
<PB N="182" REF="183">
the hairs in his beard, this very cir|cum&s;tance would have &s;haved them clean away from the con&s;ideration of the audience.</P>
<P>Taycho, opening the flood-gates of his abu&s;e, be&s;pattered all that oppo&s;ed him. Lleynah, alias Cur&s;e-mother, &s;wore that he had got into the wrong|box; then turning to Praff-fog, <Q REND="inline">"Bro|ther Praff, (cried he) thou ha&s;t now let down thy trow&s;ers, and every ra&s;cal in Japan will whip thy a&mdash;&s;e!"</Q> Praff was afraid of the Bea&s;t's re|&s;entment; but Taycho be&s;trid him like a Colo&s;&s;us, and he crept through between his legs into a place of &s;afety. This was the la&s;t time that the Orator appeared in public. Im|mediately after this occurrence it was found nece&s;&s;ary to confine him to a dark chamber, and Yak-&s;trot was left to his own inventions.</P>
<P>In this dilemma he had recour&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="184">
to the old expedient of changing hands; and as a prelude to this re|form, made advances to Gotto-mio, whom he actually detached from the oppo&s;ition, by providing his friends and dependants with lucrative offices, and promi&s;ing to take no &s;teps of con|&s;equence without his privity and ap|probation. A &s;op was at the &s;ame time thrown to Twitz-er; Zan-ti-fic, lul|led with &s;pecious promi&s;es, di&s;carded Toks the incendiary Bonze; Lob-kob &s;igned a neutrality, and old Fika-kaka was deprived of the u&s;e of &s;peech:&mdash;in a word, the ill-cemented con|federacy of Strot's exoteric foes fell a&s;under; and Legion had now no rage but the rage of hunger to be appea&s;ed. But the Ximian favourite was &s;till thwarted in his operations behind the curtain; for he had &s;o often chopped and changed the figures that compo&s;ed his motion,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
that they were all of different ma|terials; &s;o wretchedly &s;orted and &s;o ill-toned, that when they came up|on the &s;cene, they produced nothing but di&s;cord and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The Japone&s;e colony of Fat&s;i&s;io had been &s;ettled above a century, and in the face of a thou&s;and dangers and difficulties rai&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;uch con&s;ideration, that they con|&s;umed infinite quantities of the ma|nufactures of Japan, for which they payed their mother-country in gold and &s;ilver, and precious drugs, the produce of their plantations. The advantages which Japan reaped from this traffic with her own coloni&s;ts, almo&s;t equalled the amount of what &s;he gained by her commerce with all the other parts of A&s;ia. Twitz-er, when he managed the finances of Ja|pan, had in his great wi&s;dom plan|ned, procured, and promulgated a
<PB N="185" REF="186">
law &s;addling the Fat&s;i&s;ians with a grievous tax to an&s;wer the occa|&s;ions of the Japone&s;e government; an impo&s;ition which &s;truck at the very vitals of their con&s;titution, by which they were exempt from all burthens but &s;uch as they fitted for their own &s;houlders. They rai&s;ed a mighty clamour at this innovation, in which they were joined by Le|gion, at that time under the influ|ence of Taycho, who, in the a&s;&s;em|bly of the people, bitterly inveighed again&s;t the authors and abettors of &s;uch an arbitrary and tyrannical mea&s;ure. Their reproach and exe|creation did not &s;top at Twitz-er, but proceeded, as u&s;ual, to Yak-&s;trot, who was the general butt at which all the arrows of &s;lander, &s;currility, and abu&s;e, were levelled. The pup|pets with which he &s;upplied the places of Twitz-er and his a&s;&s;oci|ates,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
in order to recommend them|&s;elves to Legion, and perhaps, with a view to mortify the favourite, who had patronized the Fat&s;i&s;ian tax, in|&s;i&s;ted upon withdrawing this impo|&s;ition, which was accordingly abro|gated, to the no &s;mall di&s;grace and contempt of the law-givers: but when the&s;e new mini&s;ters were turn|ed out, to make way for Taycho and his friends, the intere&s;t of the Fat|&s;i&s;ians was again abandoned. Even the Orator him&s;elf declaimed again&s;t them with an unembarra&s;&s;ed counte|nance, after they had rai&s;ed &s;tatues to him as their friend and patron; and mea&s;ures were taken to make them feel all the &s;everity of an ab|ject dependance upon the legi&s;lature of Japan. Finally, Gotto-mio ac|ceded to this &s;y&s;tem, which he had formerly approved in conjunction with Twitz-er; and preparations
<PB N="187" REF="188">
were made for u&s;ing compul&s;ory mea&s;ures, &s;hould the coloni&s;ts re|fu&s;e to &s;ubmit with a good grace.</P>
<P>The Fat&s;i&s;ians, far from ac|quie&s;cing in the&s;e proceedings, re|&s;olved to defend to the la&s;t extre|mity tho&s;e liberties which they had hitherto pre&s;erved; and, as a proof of their independence, agreed among them&s;elves to renounce all the &s;uper|fluities with which they had &s;o long been furni&s;hed, at a va&s;t expence, from the manufactures of Japan, &s;ince that nation had begun to act towards them with all the cruelty of a &s;tep-mother. It was amazing to &s;ee and to hear how Legion raved, and &s;labbered, and &s;napped its multitu|dinous jaws in the &s;treets of Meaco, when it under&s;tood that the Fat&s;i|&s;ians were determined to live on what their own country afforded. They were repre&s;ented and reviled
<PB N="188" REF="189">
as ruffians, barbarians, and unnatu|ral mon&s;ters, who clapped the dag|ger to the brea&s;t of their indulgent mother, in pre&s;uming to &s;ave them|&s;elves the expence of tho&s;e &s;uper|fluities, which, by the bye, her cruel impo&s;itions had left them no money to purcha&s;e. Nothing was heard in Japan but threats of puni&s;hing tho&s;e ungrateful coloni&s;ts with whips and &s;corpions. For this purpo&s;e troops were a&s;&s;embled and fleets equipped; and the blatant Bea&s;t yawned with impa|tient expectation of being drenched with the blood of its fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Yak-&s;trot was &s;eized with hor|ror at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch ex|tremities; for, to give the devil his due, his di&s;po&s;ition was neither arbitrary nor cruel; but he had been hurried by evil coun&s;ellors into a train of fal&s;e politics, the con&s;e|quences of which he did not fore|&s;ee.
<PB N="189" REF="190">
He now &s;ummoned council after council to deliberate upon conciliatory expedients; but found the motley crew &s;o divided by &s;elf|intere&s;t, faction, and mutual rancour, that no con&s;i&s;tent plan could be formed: all was non&s;en&s;e, clamour, and contradiction. The Ximian favourite now wi&s;hed all his puppets at the devil, and &s;ecretly cur&s;ed the hour in which he fir&s;t undertook the motion. He even fell &s;ick of chagrin, and re&s;olved, in good ear|ne&s;t, to withdraw him&s;elf intire|ly from the political helm, which he was now convinced he had no talents to guide. In the mean time, he tried to find &s;ome tem|porary alleviation to the evils oc|ca&s;ioned by the mon&s;trous incon|gruity of the members and ma|terials that compo&s;ed his admini|&s;tration. But before any effectual
<PB N="190" REF="191">
mea&s;ures could be taken, his evil ge|nius, ever active, brewed up a new &s;torm in another quarter, which had well-nigh &s;wept him and all his projects into the gulph of perdition.</P>
