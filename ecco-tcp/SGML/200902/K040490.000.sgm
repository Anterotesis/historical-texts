<P>AS I con&s;ider my&s;elf (in the Meaning of my Motto) <HI>an humane Man, and that no Act of Humanity is a Stranger to my Heart;</HI> I could not re&s;i&s;t a natural Impul&s;e to publi&s;h the following Sheets; ina&s;much as they will tend, I hope, wi&s;h, and believe, to re|move the unju&s;t Prejudices, that have been mo&s;t wantonly and cruelly taken again&s;t a Man; and that too with an avowed Purpo&s;e, to re|pre&s;ent him, as an <HI>"ancient outlawed Fe|lon, who was &s;aid to have</HI> Caput lupinum, <HI>and might be knocked on the Head, like a Wolf, by any one who &s;hould meet him;</HI> becau&s;e, <HI>having renounced all Law, he was to be dealt with, as in a State of Na|ture, when any one, who &s;hould find him, might &s;lay him."</HI></P>
<P>But as Mr. <HI>Macklin hath not re|nounced all Law,</HI> and as <HI>"now (to avoid the Imputation of the Inhumanity above complained of) it is holden, that no Man can kill &s;uch Outlaw wantonly or wilful|ly,"</HI> he &s;eems as well intitled to the Protec|tion of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> as any other liege Subject.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI> to Mr. <HI>Buller.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t bring an Affidavit of the Fact, and make a &s;pecial Ca&s;e to have it argued, why this general Rule &s;hould not prevail again&s;t <HI>Leigh</HI> among the re&s;t?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Davenport.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wallace</HI> enlarged the Rule to this Term, for <HI>Miles, Clarke</HI> and <HI>Aldus;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> for <HI>Leigh, Sparks</HI> and <HI>James.</HI></P>

<P>They don't deny it was enlarged with regard to him, and meant to be enlarged upon his Part. Mr. <HI>Buller</HI> &s;ays candidly and fairly, he thought <HI>Leigh</HI> would have been over, and that he got it enlarged upon that Suppo&s;ition.</P>

Mr. <HI>Macklin,</HI> and his Friend Mr. <HI>Kavenhuller Skinner</HI> &s;ay, that upon the 13th of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, Mr. <HI>James,</HI> toge|ther with Mr. <HI>Aldus</HI> an Attorney at Law, was very violent, at the Head of a Party,
<PB N="8" REF="16">
in the two Shilling Gallery of <HI>Covent Gar|den</HI> Theatre; that they and their Party were the chief Per&s;ons who made the Di&s;turb|ance; and there is this particular Charge again&s;t <HI>James,</HI> that he in&s;i&s;ted a Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> one of the Actors of the &s;aid Theatre, &s;hould perform the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> which was to have been exhibited that Evening. Then Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Skinner</HI> &s;ay likewi&s;e, that upon the 18th of &s;aid <HI>No|vember</HI> Mr. <HI>James</HI> appeared again at the &s;aid Theatre, in Concert with Mr. <HI>Aldus</HI> and Mr. <HI>Miles,</HI> in Con&s;equence of a Con&s;piracy together, and that they made a violent Riot; and it is expre&s;sly charged that <HI>James,</HI> among others, called upon Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to kneel down upon the Stage, and a&s;k Pardon,&mdash;The&s;e are the Charges again&s;t Mr. <HI>James,</HI> for whom I am concerned, with &s;ome general Alle|gations to inflame; and Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> a&s;&s;erts in his Affidavit, that he, believes the &s;ole Cau&s;e of his Di&s;charge from the Theatre, was occa&s;ioned by, and owing to the&s;e riotous Proceedings. I have an Affidavit of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> which, if I am not very much mi&s;taken, to|tally
<PB N="9" REF="17">
exculpates him from any Thing of the Sort, charged By the Information in this Cau&s;e&mdash;though perhaps Mr. <HI>James</HI> was not &s;o perfectly quiet, as he could now wi&s;h he had been, yet your Lord&s;hips will find, upon his Affidavit, that he did nothing more than is done every Day, when an Auditor does not like an Actor&mdash;he tells, you he was there, when Mr. <HI>Mack|lin</HI> him&s;elf does not introduce him&mdash;he has no Reluctance in telling how often he attended the Exhibition of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and the whole of his Conduct while there&mdash;he tells your Lord&s;hip, that he went there upon the 6th of &s;aid <HI>November,</HI> when he is not charged with being there&mdash;he &s;ays he went in Company with his Wife, that may &s;atisfy your Lord&s;hip, he meant to be quiet, for to procure Quiet at Home, he took his Wife with him, and went into the two Shilling Gallery; he did not mean to make a Riot, having his Wife with him; and it might be well if every Per&s;on's Wife was as quiet as Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s. But your Lord&s;hip will find there was another lady, a Lady <HI>Macbeth,</HI> who was not &s;o quiet in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, for &s;he thought pro|per

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Affidavit of JOHN STEPHEN JAMES, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;worn the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> 1774.</HEAD>
<P>SAITH, That on the 6th of <HI>No|vember</HI> la&s;t, to the be&s;t of Depo|nent's Knowledge and Belief, as to the Time, Deponent went in Company with his Wife to Covent Garden The|atre, to &s;ee the Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> wherein Mr. <HI>Charles Macklin</HI> was to perform the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> being the third Time of his appearing in that Character; &s;aith, They were in the two Shilling Gallery, and that before the be|ginning of the Play Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> came on the Stage, with a large Parcel of Papers in his Hands, which he began to read, the Purport of which was to prove, that Mr. <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sparks</HI> had hi&s;&s;ed him the fir&s;t Night of his performing &s;aid Part of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> &s;aith, That on hearing &s;ame read, it appeared to Deponent, that there was no &s;ufficient Proof of either &s;aid <HI>Red|di&s;h</HI> or <HI>Sparks</HI> hi&s;&s;ing, neither did De|ponent
<PB N="18" REF="26">
think a mere Relation &s;ufficient to contradict the Oaths of &s;aid <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> which they had re&s;pectively made, denying that &s;aid <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> had hi&s;&s;ed on the 23d of <HI>October;</HI> Copies whereof were in&s;erted in the News Pa|pers, and Deponent did therefore di&s;|approve of &s;aid <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Behaviour, by the common Mode of Hi&s;&s;ing, and faith nothing more particular pa&s;&s;ed that Evening, and the Play was heard through, during the Performance of which Deponent applauded or hi&s;&s;ed, as he approved or di&s;approved.</P>
<P>Saith, That on 13th of &s;ame <HI>No|vember</HI> Deponent went to &s;aid Thea|tre, to &s;ee the Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> be|ing the fourth Time of Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s performing &s;aid Character, and &s;at in the two Shilling Gallery; &s;aith, that as &s;aid <HI>Macklin</HI> had not produced the po&s;itive Proof of <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spark</HI>'s hi&s;&s;ing, as he pledged him&s;elf to the Public to do Deponent, as well as many others, call'd out for &s;uch Proof or a Conce&s;&s;ion.

&s;ome little Di&s;tance from Deponent, &s;tarted up and &s;truck Deponent, and &s;aid, <HI>"This is one of the Scoundrels who hi&s;&s;ed,"</HI> or u&s;ed Words to that Effect; on which a Man, who appear|ed to be &s;itting next her, immediately &s;tarted up, and al&s;o &s;truck Deponent, who returned his Blows, and continued &s;o to do, till his Companions took him away.</P>
<P>Saith, That &s;ome little Time after &s;aid Fray happened, but during the Performance of &s;aid Play, as Deponent was endeavouring to find out &s;aid Man who had &s;truck him, a Gentleman, whom Deponent has not the lea&s;t Knowledge of, pointed out the Man, who had &s;truck him, and told Depo|nent, if he was looking for the Man who had &s;truck him, that was him, or Words to that Effect; &s;aith, upon his going up to the &s;aid Per&s;on who had &s;o &s;truck him, another Man immediate|ly ro&s;e up and &s;truck Deponent, which Blow was followed by &s;everal others, from &s;everal per&s;ons who were &s;itting near &s;aid Man, who had fir&s;t &s;truck

<P>Saith, that immediately after he had been &s;o relea&s;ed from the di&s;agreeable Situation he was in between the two Benches, he went into the Pa&s;&s;age of the &s;aid Gallery, where he was addre&s;&s;ed by a Gentleman, who informed him he was a Patentee of &s;aid Theatre (and whom Deponent believes, and has been &s;ince informed, was Mr. <HI>Dagge</HI>) and de&s;ired Deponent to give him his Ad|dre&s;s, which Deponent did, and then &s;aid he had heard Deponent had been u&s;ed very ill, and pointed to a Per&s;on, who he &s;aid was the Con&s;table of the Theatre, and had Orders from him to take out any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, whom

Deponent &s;hould fix on, who had u&s;ed him ill.</P>
<P>Saith, he then went into the Gallery, with the Con&s;table, to &s;earch for the fir&s;t Man who had &s;truck Deponent, but could not find him; and on his coming into the Gallery, with the Con&s;table, he ob&s;erved the Woman who had &s;truck him ri&s;ing from her Seat to go out, and as Deponent was following her, with a View of finding out who &s;he was, De|ponent met Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> of <HI>Charing Cro&s;s,</HI> who was then coming into the Gallery, on which Deponent de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> to watch &s;aid Woman Home, which he accordingly did, and &s;aid <HI>Lucas</HI> re|turned to &s;aid Theatre in about twenty Minutes, and informed Deponent, that he had followed her into a Hou&s;e in <HI>James Street, Covent Garden,</HI> with the Name of <HI>Macklin</HI> on the Door, and therefore Deponent at that Time verily believed, and doth now believe, that &s;aid Woman who &s;truck Deponent fir&s;t, and whom &s;aid <HI>Lucas</HI> followed to &s;aid Hou&s;e, on the Door of which Hou&s;e was wrote <HI>Macklin,</HI> to be Mrs. <HI>Macklin,</HI> Wife of &s;aid <HI>Charles Macklin;</HI></P>

what he was about, when he gave tho&s;e In&s;tructions; I now, under&s;tand it, and if the Gentleman had not advi&s;ed he &s;hould be defended, they would have given him better In&s;tructions.

<P>I am for Mr. <HI>Clarke;</HI> &s;o far as re&s;pects him, from the State of <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Affidavit, the Charge is, that upon the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> (the Affidavit not pretending <HI>Clarke</HI> to be at <HI>Covent Garden</HI> Theatre upon any former Occa&s;ions) that he &s;at in a Box one Story high, over the Stage; that when he made his Appearance, he was &s;aluted with the waving of Sticks, and a Noi&s;e&mdash;Then it is charged, that <HI>Clarke</HI> made a Signal to the Audience; next, that there was a Hi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, and crying off, off&mdash;That he gave &s;everal Signals, which, from their con|&s;tantly producing the &s;ame Effect, Depo|nent <HI>Macklin</HI> apprehends were pre-con|certed Signals, which <HI>Clarke</HI> &s;ometimes made with his Hat, and &s;ometimes with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Piece of Wood he had in his Hand, co|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered with red Cloth; with which he me|naced

<HI>Macklin,</HI> and called upon him to kneel down and a&s;k Pardon. Now in that Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> is unconfirmed, and it is de|nied by <HI>Clarke.</HI> Next it is charged, that he cried off, off, and that he beat the Scenes mo&s;t furiou&s;ly with the Board that he threw a Note upon the Stage, and ordered the Actors to go off; that he roar|ed out <HI>Coleman, Coleman,</HI> and de&s;ired him to come upon the Stage; that <HI>Clarke</HI> ap|peared to be one of tho&s;e Per&s;ons to whom this Riot and Behaviour was imputable. This is the whole of the Charge again&s;t <HI>Clarke.

Saith, &s;aid <HI>Coleman</HI> &s;till refu&s;ing to come on the Stage, Deponent imme|diately left &s;aid Theatre, and went to the Theatre Royal in <HI>Drury Lane.</HI></P>
<P>Saith, he hath been informed and believes, that &s;aid <HI>Coleman</HI> did after|wards that Evening come on &s;aid Stage, and addre&s;s him&s;elf to the Audience; and &s;aith, he never preconcerted any Signals with <HI>William Augu&s;tus Miles, John Stephen James, Ralph Aldus, Thomas Leigh</HI> and <HI>James Sparks,</HI> or any of them, to be given by him, &s;aid <HI>Jo|&s;eph Clarke,</HI> on &s;aid 18th of <HI>November,</HI> at Theatre Royal, <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> But, on the contrary, Deponent &s;aith he was, before 18th of &s;aid <HI>November,</HI> and whil&s;t the Di&s;turbance was making in &s;aid Hou&s;e that Evening, a total Stranger to &s;aid <HI>Miles, James, Aldus Leigh</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> and never had any Conver&s;ation with them, or any or either of them, touching &s;aid <HI>Macklin,</HI> or any Thing el&s;e, except that Deponent met &s;aid <HI>Miles</HI> by Accident that Night, as he was going behind the Scenes to the Green Room, to Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> as

<P>With regard to <HI>Sparks,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing him (I have not the Particulars in my Mind, but &s;uppo&s;ing him) to be charged as the greate&s;t Aggre&s;&s;or, I think there &s;hould be no Rule again&s;t him

<P>Your Lord&s;hip will give me Leave to mention what the Charge is. It goes preci&s;ely to this Point; <HI>Sparks,</HI> in Concurrence with <HI>Leigh,</HI> hires People to drive <HI>Macklin</HI> away.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;ing it ever &s;o &s;trong, Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was in the wrong, with regard to <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Sparks,</HI> in ap|pealing to the Public; and a Man who is in the wrong, &s;hould not come for the In|terpo&s;ition of this Court, again&s;t another Per&s;on, who is in the wrong.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Murphy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell your Lord&s;hip how that Matter &s;tands, and then your Lord&s;hip will judge how far Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was wrong, in regard to <HI>Sparks.</HI> The Fact is, that Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> was attacked the fir&s;t Night, and upon his fir&s;t Appearance in <HI>Macbeth.</HI> He had not been u&s;ed to that Sort of Behaviour during forty Years, and was very much a&s;toni&s;hed what could oc|ca&s;ion it&mdash;Three Per&s;ons informed him (one of whom hath now made an Affida|vit)
<PB N="70" REF="78">
that <HI>Sparks</HI> and <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> were the Peo|ple who occa&s;ioned the Tumult in the Gal|lery the fir&s;t Night&mdash;Then upon the &s;ub|&s;equent <HI>Saturday</HI> (it was Upon a <HI>Saturday</HI> he fir&s;t applied) Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> finding all the News-papers, Day after Day, Morn|ing and Evening, pouring out the mo&s;t virulent Abu&s;e upon him, calling him Murderer, Villain, and the mo&s;t oppro|brious Names of every &s;ort, and Para|graphs de&s;iring the Public to drive him from the Stage, if he ever appeared again; he went upon the Stage with a large Bun|dle of Papers, the Papers of a Week, (as I am informed, I was not there&mdash;but I think it is &s;o upon the Affidavits) he &s;aid he had been long in their Service, and there was his Reward, pointing to the Bundle of Papers of the whole Week, which he held in his Hands, full of every Scurrility that could be in&s;erted in News Papers, poured out upon him, and Para|graph's, de&s;iring the Public to drive him from the Stage, and &s;ubmitted to their Judgment, whether they would permit him to play the Characters that Night&mdash;that he had been informed <HI>Sparks</HI> and
<PB N="71" REF="79">
<HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> were the Per&s;ons who begun the Riot. Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> agreed with me, that News Paper Paragraphs were odious, and it appeared to me not to be a de&s;irable Way for Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> to refute, even <HI>Red|di&s;h</HI> upon his Oath&mdash;he readily concurred with me; and as he could not get People to prove it upon Oath, he was to procure the Papers, and read the Proof on <HI>Sa|turday.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How dared Mr. <HI>Mack|lin</HI> attempt to prove a Perjury upon <HI>Reddi&s;h;</HI> he charged <HI>Sparks</HI> and <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> in the News Papers with having hi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dunning.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy your Lord&s;hip mi&s;takes the Fact at pre&s;ent in Favour of Mr. <HI>Sparks;</HI> for the Point about which, the&s;e Parties di&s;puted, was the Un&s;ati&s;|factorine&s;s of the Proof in&s;i&s;ted upon; and the Fact to be decided by this &s;ingular Tribunal was, whether Mr. <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> had hi&s;&s;ed? <HI>Sparks</HI> adopts the Charge as far as re&s;pected him; but, &s;ays he, though I did hi&s;s, which I have a right to do, yet, <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> being an Actor, it is Matter of Imputation upon him; and I, as his Cham|pion, will make good the Charge; the
<PB N="72" REF="80">
Point to be tried was, whether they were truly or fal&s;ely charged?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That don't vary it; he charges <HI>Sparks</HI> with hi&s;&s;ing, and brings the Proof upon the Stage&mdash;charging both him and <HI>Reddi&s;h,</HI> and appeals in that way; that was wrong, he &s;hould have applied to the Laws of the Country; and if he would not, he &s;hall not come here for an extraordinary Interpo&s;ition&mdash;I go upon the Ground of <HI>Sparks</HI>'s being more guilty than any, again&s;t whom the Rules are gone&mdash;that may be taken to the Grand Jury&mdash;but with regard to <HI>Leigh,</HI> the Rule mu&s;t be made ab&s;olute, as it was enlarged for him; and the Rule mu&s;t be di&s;charged as to <HI>Sparks.</HI></P>
