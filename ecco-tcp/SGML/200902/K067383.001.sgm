<HEAD>The BRITAINS.</HEAD>
<P>THE curio&s;ity, entertained by all civilized nations, of enquiring into the exploits and adventures of their ance&s;tors, commonly excites a re|gret that the hi&s;tory of remote ages &s;hould always be &s;o much involved in ob&s;curity, uncertainty, and contradiction. Ingenious men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of leizure, are apt to pu&s;h their re&s;earches beyond the period in which literary monuments are framed or pre&s;erved, without reflecting, that the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t events is im|mediately lo&s;t or disfigured when intru&s;ted to memory or oral tradition, and that the adventures of barbarous nations, even if they were pre&s;erved, could afford little or no entertainment to tho&s;e born in a more cultivated age. The convul&s;ions of a civilized &s;tate u&s;ually compo&s;e the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of its hi&s;tory; but the &s;udden, violent, and unprepared revo|lutions, incident to Barbarians, are &s;o much guided by caprice, and terminate &s;o often in cruelty, that they di&s;gu&s;t us by the uniformity of their appearance; and it is rather fortunate for letters that they are buried in &s;ilence and oblivion. The
<PB N="2" REF="8">
only certain means, by which nations can indulge their curio&s;ity in re&s;earches concerning their remote origin, is to con&s;ider the language, manners and cu&s;|toms of their ance&s;tors, and to compare them with tho&s;e of the neighbouring nations. The fables, which are commonly employed to &s;upply the place of true hi&s;tory, ought entirely to be di&s;regarded; and if any exception be admitted to this general rule, it can only be in favour of the antient Greek fictions, which are &s;o celebrated and &s;o agreeable, that they will ever be the objects of the at|tention of mankind. Neglecting therefore, all traditions or rather tales con|cerning the more early hi&s;tory of Britain, we &s;hall only con&s;ider the &s;tate of the inhabitants, as it appeared to the Romans on their inva&s;ion of this country: We &s;hall briefly run over the events, which attended the conque&s;t made by that empire, as belonging more to Roman than Briti&s;h &s;tory: We &s;hall ha&s;ten thro' the ob&s;cure and unintere&s;ting period of Saxon annals: And &s;hall re&s;erve a more full narration for tho&s;e times, when the truth is both &s;o well a&s;certained and &s;o complete as to promi&s;e &s;ome entertainment and in&s;truction to the reader.</P>
<P>ALL antient writers agree in repre&s;enting the fir&s;t inhabitants of Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae, who peopled that i&s;land from the neighbouring con|tinent. Their language was the &s;ame, their manners, their government, their &s;uper&s;tition; varied only by tho&s;e &s;mall differences, which time or a commu|nication with the bordering nations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily introduce. The inhabitants of Gaul, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts which lye contiguous to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with their &s;outhern neighbours, &s;ome refinement in the arts, which gradually diffu&s;ed them&s;elves northwards, and &s;pread but a very faint light over this i&s;land. The Greek and Roman navigators or merchants (for there were &s;carce any other travellers in tho&s;e ages) brought back the mo&s;t &s;hocking ac|counts of the ferocity of the people, which they magnified, as u&s;ual, in order to excite the admiration of their countrymen. The &s;outh-ea&s;t parts, however, of Britain had already, before the age of Cae&s;ar, made the fir&s;t and mo&s;t requi&s;ite &s;tep towards a civil &s;ettlement; and the Britains, by tillage and agriculture, had there encrea&s;ed to a great multitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar. lib. 4.</NOTE>. The other inhabitants of the i&s;land &s;till maintained them&s;elves by pa&s;turage: They were cloathed with &s;kins of bea&s;ts: They dwelt in huts, which they reared in the fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes, with which the country was covered: They &s;hifted ea&s;ily their habitation, when actuated either by the hopes of plunder or the fear of an enemy: The convenience of feeding their cattle was even a &s;ufficient motive for removing their &s;eats: And being ignorant of all the refinements of life, their wants and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were equally &s;canty and limited.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">
THE Britains were divided into many &s;mall nations or tribes; and being a mi|litary people, who&s;e &s;ole property was their &s;word and their cattle, it was im|po&s;&s;ible, after they had acquired a reli&s;h of liberty, for their princes of chieftains to e&s;tabli&s;h any de&s;potic authority over them. Their governments, tho' mo|narchical, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sic. l. 4. Mela, lib. 3. cap. 6. Strabo. lib. 4.</NOTE> were free, as well as tho&s;e of all the Celtic nations; and the common people &s;eem even to have enjoyed more liberty among them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Don. Ca&s;&s;ius. lib. 75.</NOTE>, than among the nations of Gaul<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar. lib. 6.</NOTE>, from whom they were de&s;cended. Each &s;tate was divided into factions within it&s;elf<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE>: It was agitated with emulation towards the neigh|bouring &s;tates: And while the arts of peace were yet unknown, wars were the chief occupation, and formed the chief object of ambition, among the people.</P>
<P>THE religion of the Britains was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of their government; and the Druids, who were their prie&s;ts, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority among them. Be&s;ides mini&s;tring at the altar, and directing all religious duties, they pre&s;ided over the education of youth; they were endowed with an immu|nity from wars and taxes; they enjoyed both the civil and criminal juri&s;diction; they decided all controver&s;ies among &s;tates as well as private per&s;ons, and who|ever refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to their decree was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties. The &s;entence of excommunication was denounced again&s;t him: He was forbid acce&s;s to the &s;acrifices or public wor&s;hip: He was debarred all intercour&s;e with his fellow-citizens, even in the common affairs of life: His company was uni|ver&s;ally &s;hunned as profane and dangerous: He was refu&s;ed the protection of law<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar. lib. 6. Strabo. lib. 4.</NOTE>: And death it&s;elf became to him an acceptable relief from the mi&s;ery and infamy to which he was expo&s;ed. Thus, the bands of government, which were naturally loo&s;e among that rude and turbulent people, were happily corroborated by the terrors of their &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>No &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition was ever more terrible than that of the Druids. Be&s;ides the &s;evere penalties, which it was in the power of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal tran&s;migration of &s;ouls; and thereby extended their authority as far as the fears of their timorous votaries. They practi&s;ed their rites in dark groves or other &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. 12. cap. 1.</NOTE>; and in order to throw a greater my&s;tery on their religion, they communicated their doctrines only to the initi|ated, and &s;trictly forbad the committing them to writing; le&s;t they &s;hould at any time be expo&s;ed to the examination of the profane vulgar. Human &s;acrifices were practi&s;ed among them: The &s;poils of war were often devoted to their di|vinities;
<PB N="4" REF="10">
and they puni&s;hed with the &s;evere&s;t tortures whoever dared to &s;ecrete any part of the con&s;ecrated offering: The&s;e trea&s;ures they pre&s;erved in woods and fore&s;ts, &s;ecured by no other guard than the terrors of their religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar. lib. 6.</NOTE>; and this continued conque&s;t over human avidity may be regarded as more &s;ignal than their prompting men to the mo&s;t extraordinary and mo&s;t violent efforts. No idolatrous wor&s;hip ever attained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over mankind as that of the antient Gauls and Britains; and the Romans, after their conque&s;t, finding it im|po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the&s;e nations to the laws and in&s;titutions of their ma&s;ters, while it maintained its authority, were at la&s;t obliged to aboli&s;h it by penal &s;tatutes; a violence, which had never in any other in&s;tance been practi&s;ed by the&s;e tolerating conquerors<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in vita Claudii.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The ROMANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Britains had long remained in this rude but independant &s;tate, when Cae&s;ar, having over-run all Gaul by his victories, fir&s;t ca&s;t his eye on their i&s;land. He was not allured either by its riches or its renown; but being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new world, then wholly unknown, he took advantage of a &s;hort interval in his Gaulic wars, and made an inva&s;ion on Britain. The natives, informed of his intention, were &s;en&s;ible of the unequal conte&s;t, and endeavoured to appea&s;e him by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, which, however, re|tarded not the execution of his de&s;ign. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno ant. C. 55.</NOTE> After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, he landed, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, at Deal; and having obtained &s;everal advantages over the Britains, and obliged them to promi&s;e ho&s;tages for their future dutiful behaviour, he was con&s;trained, by the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, and the approach of winter, to with|draw his forces into Gaul. The Britains, relieved from the terror of his arms, neglected the performance of their &s;tipulations; and that haughty conqueror re&s;olved next Summer to cha&s;ti&s;e them for this breach of treaty. He landed with a greater force; and tho' he found a more regular re&s;i&s;tance from the Britains, who had united under Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus, one of their petty princes; he di&s;comfited them in every action. He advanced into the country; pa&s;&s;ed the Thames in the face of the enemy; took and burned the capital of Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus; e&s;tabli&s;hed his ally, Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ubratius, in the &s;overeignty of the Trinobantes; and having obliged the inhabitants to make him new &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, he again returned with his army into Gaul, and left the authority of the Romans more nominal than real in this i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">
THE civil wars, which en&s;ued, and which prepared the way for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of monarchy in Rome, &s;aved the Britains from that yoke, which was ready to be impo&s;ed upon them. Augu&s;tus, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Cae&s;ar, content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his own country, was little ambi|tious of acquiring &s;ame by foreign wars; and being apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the &s;ame unli|mited extent of dominion, which had &s;ubverted the republic, might al&s;o overwhelm the empire, he recommended to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors never farther to enlarge the terri|tories of the Romans. Tiberius, jealous of the fame, which might be acquired by his generals, made this advice of Augu&s;tus a pretence for his inactivity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE>: The mad &s;allies of Caligula, in which he menaced Britain with an inva&s;ion, &s;erved only to expo&s;e him&s;elf and the empire to ridicule: And the Britains had now, during almo&s;t a century, enjoyed their liberty unmole&s;ted; when the Romans, in the reign of Claudius, began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of redu ing them under their dominion. <MILESTONE N="A. D. 43." UNIT="year"> Without &s;eeking any more ju&s;tifiable rea&s;ons of ho&s;tility than were employed by the latter Europeans in &s;ubjecting the Africans and Ame|ricans, they &s;ent over an army under the command of Plautius, an able general, who gained &s;ome victories, and made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in &s;ubduing the inhabitants. Claudius him&s;elf, finding affairs &s;ufficiently prepared for his re|ception, made a journey into Britain; and received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;everal Briti&s;h &s;tates, the Cantii, Atrobates, Regni, and Trinobantes, who inhabited the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts of the i&s;land, and whom their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and cultivated man|ner of life rendered wil ing to purcha&s;e peace at the expence of their liberty. The other Britains, under the command of Caractacus, &s;till maintained an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and the Romans made little progre&s;s again&s;t them; till O&s;torius Sca|pula was &s;ent over to command their armies. <MILESTONE N="A. D. 50." UNIT="year"> This general advanced the Roman conque&s;ts over the Britains; pierced into the country of the Silures, a warlike nation, who inhabited the banks of the Severne; defeated Caractacus in a great battle; took him pri&s;oner; and &s;ent him to Rome, where his magnanimous be|haviour procured him better treatment than tho&s;e conquerors u&s;ually be&s;towed on captive princes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e misfortunes, the Britains were not &s;ubdued; and this i&s;land was regarded by the ambitious Romans as a field in which military honour might &s;till be acquired. <MILESTONE N="A. D. 59." UNIT="year"> Under the reign of Nero, Suetonius Paullinus was inve&s;ted with the command, and prepared to &s;ignalize his name by victories over the&s;e barbarians. Finding that the i&s;land of Mona, now Angle&s;ey, was the chief &s;eat of the Druids, he re&s;olved to attack it, and to &s;ubject a place,
<PB N="6" REF="12">
which was the center of their &s;uper&s;tition, and which afforded protection to all their baffled forces. The Britains endeavoured to ob&s;truct his landing on this &s;acred i&s;land, both by the force of their arms and the terrors of their religion. The women and prie&s;ts were intermingled with the &s;oldiers upon the &s;hore; and running about with flaming torches in their hands, and to&s;&s;ing their di&s;hevelled hair, they &s;truck greater terror into the a&s;toni&s;hed Romans by their howlings, cries, and execrations, than the real danger from the armed forces was able to in&s;pire. But Suetonius, exhorting his troops to de&s;pi&s;e the menaces of a &s;u|per&s;tition, which they de&s;pi&s;ed, impelled them to the attack, drove the Britains off the field, burned the Druids in the &s;ame fires which they had prepared for their captive enemies, de&s;troyed all the con&s;ecrated groves and altars; and having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britains, he thought his future progre&s;s would be ea&s;y in reducing the people to &s;ubjection. But he was di&s;appointed in his ex|pectations. The Britains, taking advantage of his ab&s;ence, were all in arms; and being headed by Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, who had been treated in the mo&s;t ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked with &s;ucce&s;s &s;everal &s;ettlements of their in&s;ulting conquerors. Suetonius ha&s;tened to the protection of London, which was already a flouri&s;hing Roman colony; but found on his arrival, that it would be requi&s;ite for the general &s;afety to aban|don that place to the mercile&s;s fury of the enemy. London was reduced to a&s;hes; &s;uch of the inhabitants, as remained in it, cruelly ma&s;&s;acred; the Romans and all &s;trangers, to the number of 70,000, put to the &s;word without di&s;tinction; and the Britains, by rendering the war thus bloody, &s;eemed determined to cut off all hopes of peace or compo&s;ition with the enemy. But this cruelty was re|venged by Suetonius in a great and deci&s;ive battle, where 80,000 of the Britains are &s;aid to have peri&s;hed; and Boadicea her&s;elf, rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life by poi&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</NOTE>. Nero &s;oon after recalled Suetonius from a government; where by &s;uffering and inflicting &s;o many &s;everities he was judged improper for compo&s;ing the angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants. After &s;ome interval, Cerealis received the command from Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman arms. Julius Frontinus &s;ucceeded Cerealis both in authority and reputation: <MILESTONE N="A. D." UNIT="year"> But the general, who finally e&s;tabli&s;hed the dominion of the Romans in this i&s;land, was Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Titus, and Domitian, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in that &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>THIS great commander formed a regular plan for &s;ubduing Britain, and ren|dering the acqui&s;ition u&s;eful to the victors. He carried his victorious arms north|wards,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
defeated the Britains in every encounter, pierced into the inacce&s;&s;ible fo|re&s;ts and mountains of Caledonia, reduced every thing to &s;ubjection in the &s;outh|ern parts of the i&s;land, and chaced before him all the men of fiercer and more in|tractable &s;pirits, who deemed war and death it&s;elf le&s;s intolerable than &s;ervitude under the conquerors. He even defeated them in a deci&s;ive action, which they fought under Galcacus, their leader; and having drawn a rampart, and fixed a train of garri&s;ons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he thereby cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the i&s;land, and &s;ecured the Roman province from the inva&s;ion of the barbarous inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit.

The inhabitants, having experienced how unequal their own force was to re&s;i&s;t that of the Romans, acquie&s;ced in the dominion of their ma&s;ters, and were gra|dually incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.</P>
<P>THIS was the la&s;t durable conque&s;t made by the Romans; and Britain, once &s;ubdued, gave no farther inquietude to the victor. Caledonia alone, defended by its barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Romans entertained of it, &s;ometimes infe&s;ted the more cultivated parts of the i&s;land by the incur&s;ions of its inhabitants. The better to &s;ecure the frontiers of the empire, Adrian, who vi&s;ited this i&s;land, built a &s;trong rampart between Tyne and the firth of Solway: Lollius Urbicus, under Antoninus Pius, repaired that of Agricola: Severus, who made an expedition into Britain, and carried his arms into the mo&s;t north|ern extremity of it, added new fortifications to the wall of Adrian; and during all the reigns of the Roman emperors, &s;uch a profound tranquillity prevailed in Britain, that little mention is made of the affairs of that i&s;land by any hi&s;torian. The only incidents which occur, are &s;ome &s;editions or rebellions of the Roman legions quartered there, and &s;ome u&s;urpations of the imperial dignity by the Ro|man governors. The natives, di&s;armed, di&s;pirited, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, had lo&s;t all de&s;ire and even idea of their former liberty and independance.</P>
<P>BUT the period was now come, when that enormous fabric of the Roman em|pire, which had diffu&s;ed &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, together with peace and civility, over &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the globe, was approaching towards its final di&s;&s;o|lution. Italy, and the center of the empire, removed, during &s;o many ages,

from all concern in the wars, had entirely lo&s;t the military &s;pirit, and were peo|pled by an enervated race, equally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranhy of their own rulers. The emperors found them&s;elves obliged to re|cruit their legions from the frontier provinces, where the genius of war, though langui&s;hing, was not totally extinct; and the&s;e mer enary forces, carele&s;s of laws and civil in&s;titutions, e&s;tabli&s;hed a military government, no le&s;s dangerous to the &s;overeign than to the people. The farther progre&s;s of the &s;ame di&s;orders intro|duced the bordering barbarians into the &s;ervice of the Romans; and tho&s;e fierce nations, having now added di&s;cipline and &s;kill to their native bravery, could no longer be re&s;trained by the impotent policy of the emperors, who were accu&s;tomed to employ the one in the de&s;truction of the other. Sen&s;ible of their own force, and allured by the pro&s;pect of &s;o rich a prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius, a&s;&s;ailed at once all the frontiers of the Roman empire; and having fir&s;t &s;atiated their avidity by plunder, began to think of fix|ing a &s;ettlement in the wa&s;ted provinces. The more di&s;tant barbarians, who oc|cupied the de&s;erted habitations of the former, advanced in their acqui&s;itions, and pre&s;&s;ed with their incumbent weight the Roman &s;tate, already unequal to the load which it &s;u&s;tained. In&s;tead of arming the people in their own defence, the em|perors recalled all the di&s;tant legions, in whom alone they could repo&s;e confi|dence; and collected the whole military force for the defence of the capital and center of the empire. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation had &s;uperceded the am|bition of power; and the antient point of honour, of never contracting the limits of the empire, could no longer be attended to in this de&s;perate extremity.</P>
<P>BRITAIN by its &s;ituation was removed from the fury of the&s;e barbarous incur|&s;ions; and being al&s;o a remote province, not much valued by the Romans, the legions, which defended it, were carried over to the protection of Italy and Gaul. But that province, though &s;ecured by the &s;ea again&s;t the inroads of the greater tribes of barbarians, found enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage of its pre&s;ent defencele&s;s &s;ituation. The Picts and Scots, who dwelt in the northern parts, beyond the wall of Antoninus, made incur&s;ions upon their peaceable and effeminate neighbours; and be&s;ides the temporary depredations which they com|mitted, threatened the whole province with &s;ubjection, or, what the inhabitants more dreaded, with plunder and deva&s;tation. The former nation &s;eem to have been a tribe of the native Briti&s;h race, who, having been chaced into the north|ern parts by the conque&s;ts of Agricola, had there intermingled with the antient inhabitants: The other were derived from the &s;ame Celtic origin, had fir&s;t been e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland, had &s;ent over a colony to the north-we&s;t coa&s;ts of this i&s;land, and had long been accu&s;tomed, as well from their old as their new &s;eats, to infe&s;t

the Roman province by their pyracy and rapine. The&s;e two tribes, finding their more opulent neighbours expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion, &s;oon broke over the Roman wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms; and though a contemptible enemy in them&s;elves, met with no re&s;i&s;tance from the unwarlike inhabitants. The Britains, accu&s;tomed to have recour&s;e to the emperors for defence as well as government, made &s;upplications to Rome; and one legion was &s;ent over for their protection. This force was an over-match for the barbarians, repelled their inva&s;ion, routed them in every engagement, and having chaced them into their antient limits, re|turned in triumph to the defence of the &s;outhern provinces of the empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12.

The Britains made again an application to Rome, and obtained again the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a legion, which proved effectual for their relief: But the Romans, reduced to extremities at home, and fatigued with the&s;e di&s;tant expeditions, informed the Britains that they mu&s;t no longer look to them for &s;uccour, exhorted them to arm in their own defence, and urged, that as they were now their own ma&s;ters, it became them to protect by their valour that independence which their antient lords had conferred upon them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12.

<P>THE abject Britains regarded this pre&s;ent of liberty as fatal to them; and were in no condition to put in practice the prudent advice given them by the Romans, of arming in their own defence. Unaccu&s;tomed both to the perils of war, and to the cares of civil government, they found them&s;elves incapable of forming or executing any mea&s;ures for re&s;i&s;ting the incur&s;ions of the barbarians.

The Britains, already &s;ubdued by their own fears, found the ramparts but a weak defence for them; and de&s;erting their &s;ta|tion, left the country entirely open to the inroads of the barbarous enemy.

<P>AFTER the death of Vortimer, Ambro&s;ius, a Britain, tho' of Roman de&s;cent, was inve&s;ted with the command over his countrymen, and endeavoured, not without &s;ucce&s;s, to unite them in their re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Saxons. The&s;e con|te&s;ts increa&s;ed the animo&s;ity between the two nations, and rouzed the military &s;pirit of the antient inhabitants which had before been &s;unk into &s;uch a fatal lethargy. Hengi&s;t, however, notwith&s;tanding their oppo&s;ition, &s;till kept his ground in Britain; and in order to divide the forces and attention of the Britains, he called over a new tribe of Saxons under the command of his brother Octa, and of Ebi&s;&s;a, the &s;on of Octa; and he &s;ettled them in Northumberland. He him&s;elf remained in the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, and laid the foundation of the kingdom of Kent, comprehending the county of that name, Middle&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex, and part of Surrey. He fixed his royal &s;eat at Canterbury; where he governed about forty years, and he died in or near the year 488; leaving his new acquired dominions to his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of Hengi&s;t excited the avidity of the other inhabitants of the northern regions of Germany; and at different times, and under different leaders, they flocked over in multitudes to the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land.

&s;ame in&s;titutions, they were naturally led, from the&s;e cau&s;es, as well as from their common intere&s;t, to unite them&s;elves again&s;t the antient inhabitants. The re&s;i&s;tance, however unequal, was &s;till maintained by the Britains; but became every day more feeble: And their misfortunes admitted of few intervals, till they were driven into Cornwal and Wales, and received protection from the remote &s;ituation or inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Saxon &s;tate, after that of Kent, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, was the kingdom of South-Saxony. In the year 477<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

The Britains, now armed, abandoned not tamely their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; nor were they expelled, till de|feated in many battles by their warlike invaders. The mo&s;t memorable action, mentioned by hi&s;torians, is that of Mearcredes-Burn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saxon. Chron. A D. 485. Flor.

But Aella, re-inforced by fre&s;h num|bers of his countrymen, again took the field again&s;t the Britains; and laid &s;iege to Andred-Cea&s;ter, which was defended by the garri&s;on and inhabitants with de&s;|perate valour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> lib. 2.</NOTE>. The Saxons, enraged by this re&s;i&s;tance, and by the fatigues and dangers which they had &s;u&s;tained, redoubled their efforts again&s;t the place, and when ma&s;ters of it, put all their enemies to the &s;word without di&s;tinction. This deci&s;ive advantage &s;ecured the conque&s;ts of Aella, who a&s;&s;umed the name of King, and extended his dominion over Su&s;&s;ex and a great part of Surrey. He was &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">pped in his progre&s;s to the ea&s;t by the kingdom of Kent: In that to the we&s;t, by another tribe of Saxons, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that ter|ritory.</P>

None of the other tribes of Saxons met with &s;uch vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, or exerted &s;uch valour and per&s;e|verance in pu&s;hing their conque&s;ts. Cerdic was even obliged to call for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his countrymen from the kingdoms of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex, as well as from Germany, and he was thence joined by a fre&s;h army under the command

of Porte, and of his &s;ons Bleda and Megla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 17.</NOTE>. Strengthened by the&s;e &s;uccours, he fought in the year 508 a de&s;perate battle with the Britains, commanded by Nazan-Leod, their leader, who was victorious in the beginning of the action, and routed the wing in which Cerdic him&s;elf commanded. But Kenric, who had prevailed in the other wing, brought timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his father, and re&s;tored the battle, which ended with a complete victory on the &s;ide of the Saxons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">H.

The war &s;till continued, tho' the &s;uc|ce&s;s was commonly on the &s;ide of the Saxons, who&s;e &s;hort &s;words and clo&s;e man|ner of fighting, gave them great advantage over the mi&s;&s;ile weapons of the Bri|tains. Cerdic was not wanting to his good fortune; and in order to extend his conque&s;ts, he laid &s;iege to Mount Badon or Bane&s;downe near Bath, whither the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of the di&s;comfited Britains had retired. The &s;outhern Britains in this extremity applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Arthur, prince of the Silures, who&s;e heroic valour now &s;u&s;tained the declining fate of his country<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>.

<P>WHILE the Saxons made this progre&s;s in the &s;outh, their countrymen were not le&s;s active in other quarters. In the year, 527<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H.

That of the Ea&s;t-Angles, the courties of Cambridge, Suffolk and Norfolk. Mercia was extended over all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn, to the frontiers of the&s;e two kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, &s;oon after the landing of Hengi&s;t, had been planted in Nor|thumberland; but meeting with an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and making but &s;mall progre&s;s in &s;ubduing the inhabitants, their affairs were in &s;o un&s;ettled a condi|tion, that none of their princes for a long time a&s;&s;umed the appellation of king. At la&s;t in 547<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p 19.</NOTE>, Ida, a Saxon prince of great merit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Will.

The&s;e two kingdoms were united in the per&s;on of Ethelfrid, grand&s;on of Ida, who married Acca, the daughter of Aella; and expelling her brother, Edwin, e&s;tabli&s;hed one of the mo&s;t powerful of the Saxon kingdoms, under the title of Northumberland. How far his dominions extended into the country now called Scotland is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted, that all the lowlands, e&s;pecially the ea&s;t-coa&s;t of that country, were peopled in a great mea&s;ure from Germany; tho' the expeditions, made by the &s;everal Saxon ad|venturers, have e&s;caped the records of hi&s;tory.

<HEAD>The HEPTARCHY.</HEAD>
<P>THUS was e&s;tabli&s;hed, after a violent &s;truggle of near an hundred and fifty years, the Heptarchy, or &s;even Saxon kingdoms, in Britain; and the whole &s;outhern part of the i&s;land, except Wales and Cornwal, had totally changed its inhabitants, language, cu&s;toms, and political in&s;titutions. The Britains, under
<PB N="19" REF="25">
the Roman dominion, had made &s;uch advances towards arts and civil manners, that they had built twenty-eight con&s;iderable cities within their province, be&s;ides a great number of villages and country-&s;eats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gildas. Bede, lib. 1.</NOTE>; but the fierce conquerors, by whom they were now &s;ubdued, threw every thing back into antient barbarity; and tho&s;e few natives, who were not either ma&s;&s;acred or expelled their habitations, were reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. None of the other northern con|querors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals, or Burgundians, tho' they over-ran the &s;outhern provinces, like a mighty torrent, made &s;uch deva&s;tations in the con|quered territories, or were inflamed into &s;uch a violent animo&s;ity again&s;t the antient inhabitants. As the Saxons came over at intervals in &s;eparate bodies, the Britains, however at fir&s;t unwarlike, were tempted to make re&s;i&s;tance; and ho&s;tilities, being thereby prolonged, proved more de&s;tructive to both parties, e&s;pecially to the vanqui&s;hed. The fir&s;t invaders from Germany, in&s;tead of ex|cluding other adventurers, who mu&s;t &s;hare with them the &s;poils and property of the antient inhabitants, were obliged to invite over fre&s;h &s;upplies from their own country; and a total extermination of the Britains became the &s;ole expedient for providing a &s;ettlement and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to the new planters. Hence there have been found in hi&s;tory few conque&s;ts more ruinous than that of the Saxons; and few revolutions more violent than that which they introduced.</P>
<P>So long as the conte&s;t was maintained with the natives, the &s;everal Saxon princes pre&s;erved an union of councils and intere&s;ts; but after the Britains were &s;hut up in the barren countries of Cornwal and Wales, and gave no farther in|quietude to the conquerors, the band of alliance was in a great mea&s;ure di&s;&s;olved among the princes of the Heptarchy; and tho' one prince &s;eems &s;till to have been allowed or to have a&s;&s;umed an a&s;cendant over the whole, his authority, if it ought ever to be deemed regular or legal, was extremely limited; and each &s;tate acted as if it had been totally &s;eparate and independant of the re&s;t. Wars, therefore, and revolutions and di&s;&s;entions were unavoidable among a turbulent and military people; and the&s;e events, however intricate or confu&s;ed, &s;hould now become the objects of our attention. But, added to the difficulty of carrying on at once the hi&s;tory of &s;even independent kingdoms, there is a great di&s;couragement to a writer, ari&s;ing from the uncertainty, at lea&s;t barrenne&s;s, of the accounts tran&s;mitted to us. The Monks, who were the only annali&s;ts during tho&s;e ages, lived remote from public affairs, con&s;idered the civil tran&s;actions as entirely &s;ubordinate to the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical, and be&s;ides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity, which were then univer&s;al, were &s;trongly infected with credulity, with the love of wonder, and
<PB N="20" REF="26">
with a propen&s;ity to impo&s;ture; vices almo&s;t in&s;eparable from their profe&s;&s;ion, and manner of life. The hi&s;tory of that period abounds in names, but is ex|tremely barren of events; or the events are related &s;o much without circum|&s;tances and cau&s;es, that the mo&s;t profound or mo&s;t eloquent writer mu&s;t de&s;pair of rendering them either in&s;tructive or entertaining to the reader. Even the great learning and vigorous imagination of Milton &s;unk under the weight; and this author &s;cruples not to declare, that he e&s;teems the &s;kirmi&s;hes of kites or crows equally de&s;erving of a particular narrative, as the confu&s;ed tran&s;actions and battles of the Saxon Heptarchy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton in Kennet, p. 50.</NOTE>. In order, however, to connect the events in &s;ome tolerable mea&s;ure, we &s;hall give a &s;uccinct account of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of kings, and of the revolutions in each particular kingdom; beginning with that of Kent, which was the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of KENT.</HEAD>
<P>ESCUS &s;ucceeded his father, Hengi&s;t, in the Kingdom of Kent; but &s;eems not to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the military reputation enjoyed by that conqueror, who fir&s;t made way for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain. All the Saxons, who &s;ought the fame of valour, or new e&s;tabli&s;hments by arms, flocked to the &s;tandard of Aella, King of Su&s;&s;ex, who was carrying on &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t the Britains, and laying the foundations of a new kingdom. E&s;cus was contented to po&s;&s;e&s;s in tranquility the kingdom of Kent, which he left in 512 to his &s;on Octa, in who&s;e time the Ea&s;t-Saxons e&s;tabli&s;hed their monarchy, and di&s;mem|bered the provinces of E&s;&s;ex and Middle&s;ex from that of Kent. His death, after twenty-two years reign, made room for his &s;on Hermenric in 534, who per|formed nothing memorable during a reign of thirty-two years; except a&s;&s;ociat|ing with him his &s;on, Ethelbert, in the government, in order the better to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his family, and prevent &s;uch revolutions as are incident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy.</P>
<P>ETHELBERT revived the reputation of his family, which had langui&s;hed for &s;ome generations. The inactivity of his predece&s;&s;ors, and the &s;ituation of his country, &s;ecured from all ho&s;tility with the Britains, &s;eems to have much weakened the warlike genius of the Kenti&s;h Saxons; and Ethelbert, in his fir&s;t attempt to ag|grandize his country, and di&s;tingui&s;h his own name, met with very bad &s;uc|ce&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 21.</NOTE>. He was twice di&s;comfited in battle by Ceaulin, King of We&s;&s;ex; and obliged to yield the &s;uperiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch, who
<PB N="21" REF="27">
pre&s;erved no moderation in his victory, and by &s;ubjecting the kingdom of Su&s;|&s;ex, excited jealou&s;y in all the other princes. An a&s;&s;ociation was formed again&s;t him; and Ethelbert, entru&s;ted with the command of the allies, fought him in a great battle, and obtained a deci&s;ive victory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>. Ceaulin died &s;oon after; and Ethelbert &s;ucceeded as well to his a&s;cendant among the Saxon &s;tates, as to his other ambitious and exorbitant projects. He reduced all the princes, except the king of Northumberland, to a &s;trict dependance upon him; and even e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf by force on the throne of Mercia, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive of the Saxon king|doms. Apprehen&s;ive, however, of a dangerous league again&s;t him, like that by which he him&s;elf had been enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the prudence to re&s;ign the throne of Mercia to Webba, the rightful heir, the &s;on of Crida, who had fir&s;t founded that monarchy. But governed &s;till by ambition more than by ju&s;tice, he gave Webba po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown on &s;uch conditions, as rendered him little better than a tributary prince under his artful benefactor.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t memorable and mo&s;t fortunate event, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the reign of this great prince, was the introduction of the Chri&s;tian religion among the Engli&s;h Saxons. The &s;uper&s;tition of the Germans, particularly that of the Saxons, was of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous kind; and being founded on cer|tain traditional tales, received from their ance&s;tors, not reduced to any &s;y&s;tem, not &s;upported by political in&s;titutions, like that of the Druids, it &s;eems to have made little impre&s;&s;ion on its votaries, and to have ea&s;ily re&s;igned its place to the new doctrine, promulgated to them. Woden, whom they believed the ance&s;tor of all their princes, was regarded as the god of war, and, by a natural con&s;e|quence, became their &s;upreme deity, and the chief object of their religious wor|&s;hip. They believed, that, if they obtained the favour of this divinity by their valour, (for they made le&s;s account of the other virtues) they would be admitted after their death into his hall, and repo&s;ing on couches, would &s;atiate them&s;elves with ale from the &s;kulls of their enemies, whom they had &s;lain in battle. In|cited by this idea of paradi&s;e, which gratified at once the pa&s;&s;ion of revenge and that of intemperance, the ruling inclinations of barbarians, they de&s;pi&s;ed the dan|gers of war, and encrea&s;ed their native ferocity again&s;t the vanqui&s;hed by their religious prejudices. We know little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons: We only learn that they were idolaters; that they wor&s;hiped the &s;un and moon; that they adored the god of thunder, under the name of Thor; that they had images in their temples; that they practi&s;ed &s;acrifices; believed firmly in &s;pells and inchantments; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">dmitted in general a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines, which they held as &s;acred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;uper&s;titions, mu&s;t bear the
<PB N="22" REF="28">
air of the wilde&s;t extravagance, if propounded to tho&s;e who are not familiarized to it from their earlie&s;t infancy.</P>
<P>THE con&s;tant ho&s;tilities which the Saxons maintained again&s;t the Britains, would naturally indi&s;po&s;e them from receiving the Chri&s;tian faith, when preach|ed to them by &s;uch inveterate enemies; and perhaps the Britains, as is objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not over fond of communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal life and &s;alvation. But as a civilized people, however &s;ubdued by arms, &s;till maintain a &s;en&s;ible &s;uperiority over barbarous and ignorant nations, all the other northern conquerors of Europe had been already induced to embrace the Chri&s;tian faith, which they found e&s;tabli&s;hed in the em|pire; and it was impo&s;&s;ible but the Saxons, informed of this event, mu&s;t have regarded with &s;ome degree of veneration a doctrine which had acquired the a&s;cen|dant over all their brethren. However limited in their views, they could not but have perceived a degree of cultivation in the &s;outhern counties beyond what they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and it was natural for them to yield to that &s;uperior know|ledge, as well as zeal, by which the inhabitants of the Chri&s;tian kingdoms were even at this time di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e cau&s;es might long have failed of operating their effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the means of introducing Chri&s;tianity into Kent. Ethelbert, in his father's lifetime, had married Bertha, the only daughter of Ca|ribert, King of Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Greg. of Tours, lib. 9. cap. 26. H. Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>, one of the de&s;cendants of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul; but before he was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to &s;tipulate, that the prince&s;s &s;hould enjoy the free exerci&s;e of her religion; a conce&s;&s;ion not difficult to be obtained from the idolatrous Saxons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25. Brompton, p. 729.</NOTE>. Bertha brought over a French bi&s;hop to the court of Canterbury; and being zealous for the propagation of her reli|gion, &s;he had been very a&s;&s;iduous in her devotional exerci&s;es, had &s;upported the credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct, and had employed every art of in&s;inuation and addre&s;s to reconcile her hu&s;band to her religious principles. Her popularity in the court, and her influence over Ethelbert, had &s;o well paved the way for the reception of the Chri&s;tian doctrine, that Gregory, &s;irnamed the Great, the pre&s;ent Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of effectuating a project, which he him&s;elf, before he mounted the papal throne, had once embraced for converting the Briti&s;h Saxons.</P>
<P>IT happened, that this prelate, being then in a private &s;tation, had ob&s;erved in the market-place of Rome &s;ome Saxon youths expo&s;ed to &s;ale, whom the Roman merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain, had bought of their mercenary

parents.

<P>THE controver&s;y between the Pagans and the Chri&s;tians was not entirely cooled in that age; and no pontiff before Gregory had ever carried to greater exce&s;&s;es his intemperate zeal again&s;t the former religion.

Ambitious to di&s;tingui&s;h his pontificate by the conver&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Saxons, he pitched on Augu&s;tine, a Roman monk, and &s;ent him with forty a&s;&s;ociates to preach the go&s;|pel in this i&s;land.

<HEAD>The Kingdom of WESSEX.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of We&s;&s;ex, which finally &s;wallowed up all the other Saxon &s;tates, met with great oppo&s;ition on its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment; and the Britains, who were now enured to arms, yielded not tamely their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions to the&s;e invaders. Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, and his &s;on, Kenric, fought many &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful battles, again&s;t the na|tives; and the martial &s;pirit, common to all the Saxons, was by means of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, carried to the greate&s;t height among this tribe. Ceaulin, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Kenric, who began his reign in 560, was even more ambitious and enterprizing than his predece&s;&s;ors; and by waging continual war again&s;t the Britains, he added a great part of the counties of Devon and Somer&s;et to his other dominions. Carried away by the tide of &s;ucce&s;s, he invaded the other Saxon &s;tates in his neighbourhood, and becoming terrible to all, he provoked a general confederacy again&s;t him. This alliance proved &s;ucce&s;sful under the con|duct of Ethelbert, King of Kent; and Ceaulin who had lo&s;t the affections of his own &s;ubjects by his violent di&s;po&s;ition, and had now fallen into contempt from his misfortunes, was expelled the throne<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

Cui|chelme and Cuthwin, his &s;ons, governed jointly the kingdom; till the expul&s;ion of the latter in 591, and the death of the former in 593, made way for Cealric, to whom &s;ucceeded Ceobald in 593, by who&s;e death, which happened in 611, Kynegils inherited the crown.

Eg|bert, &s;en&s;ible of his danger from the &s;u&s;picions of Brithric, withdrew &s;ecretly into France<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">H.

By living in the court, and &s;erving in the armies of that prince, the mo&s;t able and mo&s;t generous who had appeared in Europe during &s;everal ages, he acquired tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which afterwards enabled him to make &s;uch a &s;bining figure on the throne; and familiarizing him&s;elf to the manners of the French, who, as Malme&s;bury ob&s;erves<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 11.</NOTE>, were eminent both for valour and civility, above all the we&s;tern nations, he learned to poli&s;h the rudene&s;s and barbarity of the Saxon character: And his early misfortunes proved thus of infinite advantage to him.</P>
<P>IT was not long before Egbert had opportunities of di&s;playing his natural and acquired talents. Brithric, King of We&s;&s;ex, had married Eadburga, natural daughter <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 749, 750. W. Malme&s;. lib. 1. cap. 2. H.

She had mixed a cup of poi&s;on for a young nobleman, who had acquired her hu&s;band's friend&s;hip, and had on that account become the object of her jealou&s;y: But unfortunately, the King drank of the fatal cup along with his favourite, and &s;oon after expired<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Higden. lib. 5.

even in a married &s;tate, the royal families had been entirely extingui&s;hed in all the kingdoms except that of We&s;&s;ex; and the emulations, &s;u&s;picions, and con&s;pira|cies, which had formerly been confined to the princes of the blood alone, were now diffu&s;ed among all the nobility in the &s;everal Saxon &s;tates. Egbert was the &s;ole de&s;cendant of tho&s;e fir&s;t conquerors who &s;ubdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by claiming a pedigree from Woden, the &s;upreme divinity of their ance&s;tors. But that prince, tho' invited by this favourable circum&s;tance to make attempts on the neighbouring Saxons, gave them for &s;ome time no di&s;turbance, and rather cho&s;e to turn his arms again&s;t the Britains in Cornwal, whom he de|feated in &s;everal battles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 69.</NOTE>. He was recalled from the conque&s;t of that country by an inroad made into his dominions by Bernulf, King of Mercia.</P>
<P>THE Mercians, before the acce&s;&s;ion of Egbert, had very nearly attained the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty over the heptarchy: They had reduced the Ea&s;t-Angles un|der &s;ubjection, and e&s;tabli&s;hed tributary princes in the kingdoms of Kent and E&s;&s;ex. Northumberland was involved in anarchy; and no &s;tate of any con&s;equence remained but that of We&s;&s;ex, which, much inferior in extent to Mercia, was &s;upported alone by the great qualities of its &s;overeign. Egbert led his army again&s;t the invaders; and encountering them at Ellandun in Wilt&s;hire, ob|tained a compleat victory, and by the &s;laughter committed on them in their flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of the Mercians, Whil&s;t he him&s;elf, in pro&s;ecution of his victory, entered their country on the &s;ide of Oxford&s;hire, and threatened the heart of their dominions; he &s;ent an army into Kent, commanded by Ethelwolph, his elde&s;t &s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 2.</NOTE>; and expelling Baldred, the tributary King, &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that country. The kingdom of E&s;&s;ex was conquered with equal facility; and the Ea&s;t-Angles, from their hatred to the Mercian go|vernment, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed over them by treachery and violence, and probably exerci&s;ed with tyranny, immediately ro&s;e in arms, and craved the pro|tection of Egbert<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE>. Bernulf, the Mercian King, who marched again&s;t them, was defeated and &s;lain; and two years after, Ludecan, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, met with the &s;ame fate. The&s;e in&s;urrections and calamities facilitated the enterprizes of Egbert, who advanced into the heart of the Mercian territories, and made ea&s;y conque&s;ts over a di&s;heartened and divided people. In order to engage them more ea&s;ily to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he allowed Wiglef, their countryman, to retain the title of King, whil&s;t he him&s;elf exerci&s;ed the real powers of &s;overeignty<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ingulph, p. 7, 8, 10.</NOTE>. The anarchy, which prevailed in Northumberland, tempted him to carry &s;till

farther his victorious arms; and the inhabitants, unable to re&s;i&s;t his power, and de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed form of government, were forward, on his fir&s;t appearance, to &s;end deputies, who &s;ubmitted to his authority, and expre&s;&s;ed their allegiance to him as their &s;overeign. Egbert, however, &s;till allowed to Northumberland, as he had done to Mercia and Ea&s;t-Anglia, the power of elect|ing a King, who paid him tribute, and was dependant on him.</P>
<P>THUS were united all the kingdoms of the heptarchy in one great &s;tate, near four hundred years after the fir&s;t arrival of the Saxons in Britain; and the for|tunate arms and prudent policy of Egbert at la&s;t effectuated what had been &s;o often attempted in vain by &s;o many princes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p 71.</NOTE>. Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, which had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a&s;pired to general dominion, were now incorpo|rated in his empire; and the other &s;ubordinate kingdoms &s;eemed willingly to &s;hare the &s;ame fate. His territories were nearly of the &s;ame extent with what is now properly denominated England; and a favourable pro&s;pect was afforded the Anglo-Saxons, of e&s;tabli&s;hing a civilized monarchy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tranquillity within it&s;elf, and &s;ecure again&s;t foreign inva&s;ion. This great event happened in the year 827<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, tho' they had been &s;o long &s;ettled in the i&s;land, &s;eem not as yet to have been much improved beyond their German ance&s;tors, either in arts, ci|vility, knowledge, humanity, ju&s;tice, or obedience to the laws. Even Chri&s;tia|nity, tho', among other advantages, it opened the way to connexions between them and the more poli&s;hed &s;tates of Europe, had not hitherto been very effectual, in ba|ni&s;hing their ignorance, or &s;oftening their barbarous manners. As they received that doctrine thro' the corrupted channels of Rome, which had &s;trongly tinctured the original purity of the Chri&s;tian faith, it carried along with it a great mixture of credulity and &s;uper&s;tition, equally de&s;tructive to the under&s;tanding and to mo|rals. The reverence towards &s;aints and reliques &s;eems to have almo&s;t &s;upplanted the adoration of the &s;upreme Being: Mona&s;tic ob&s;ervances were e&s;teemed more meritorious than the active virtues: The knowledge of natural cau&s;es was ne|glected from the univer&s;al belief of miraculous interpo&s;itions and judgments: Bounty to the church atoned for all violences again&s;t &s;ociety: And the remor&s;es for cruelty, murder, treachery, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the more robu&s;t vices, were appea&s;ed, not by amendment of life, but by penances, &s;ervility to the monks, and an abject and illiberal devotion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">THESE abu&s;es were common to all the European churches; but the prie&s;ts in Italy, Spain, and Gaul, made &s;ome atonement for them by other advantages, which they rendered &s;ociety. For &s;everal ages, they were almo&s;t all Romans, or, in other words, the antient natives; and they pre&s;erved the Roman language and laws, with &s;ome remains of the former civility. But the prie&s;ts in the heptarchy, after the fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ionaries, were wholly Saxon, and almo&s;t as ignorant and barbarous as the laity. They contributed, therefore, little to the improvement of the &s;ociety in knowledge or the arts.</NOTE>. The reverence for the clergy had mount|ed
<PB N="43" REF="49">
&s;o high, that wherever a per&s;on appeared in a &s;acerdotal habit, tho' on the high way, the people flocked around him; and &s;howing him all marks of pro|found re&s;pect, received every word he uttered as the mo&s;t &s;acred oracles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede. lib. 3. cap. 26.</NOTE>. Even the military virtues, &s;o inherent in all the Saxon tribes, began to be neglected; and the nobility, preferring the &s;ecurity and &s;loth of the cloy&s;ter to the tumults and glory of war, valued them&s;elves chiefly on the endowment of mona&s;teries, of which they a&s;&s;umed the government<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 23.

The crown too, being extremely impoveri&s;hed by continual benefactions to the church, to which the &s;tates of the kingdom weakly con&s;ented, could be&s;tow no rewards on valour or military &s;er|vices, and retained not even &s;ufficient influence to &s;upport the government<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bedae Epi&s;t. ad Egbert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER inconvenience, which attended this corrupt &s;pecies of Chri&s;tianity, was the &s;uper&s;titious attachment to Rome, and the gradual &s;ubjection of the king|dom to a foreign juri&s;diction. The Britains had never acknowledged any &s;ubor|dination to the Roman pontiff, and had conducted all eccle&s;ia&s;tical government by their dome&s;tic &s;ynods and councils<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Append. to Bede, numb. 10. ex edit. 1722. Spelm. Conc. p. 108, 109.</NOTE>: But the Saxons, receiving their religion from Roman monks, were taught at the &s;ame time a profound reverence to that &s;ee, and were naturally led to regard it as the capital of their religion. Pilgrim|ages to Rome were repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t meritorious acts of devotion. Not only noblemen and ladies of rank undertook this tedious journey<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 7.</NOTE>; but Kings them&s;elves, abdicating their crowns, &s;ought for a &s;ecure pa&s;&s;port to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New reliques, continually &s;ent from that endle&s;s mint of &s;uper&s;tition, and magnified by the lying miracles, invented in convents, operated on the a&s;toni&s;hed minds of the multitude: And every prince attained the eulogies of the monks, the only hi&s;torians of tho&s;e ages, not in proportion to his civil and military virtues, but to his devoted attachment towards their order, and his &s;uper&s;titious reverence for Rome.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign pontiff, encouraged by this blindne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition of the people, advanced every day in his enterprizes on the independance of the Engli&s;h churches. Wilfrid, bi&s;hop of Lindisferne, the &s;ole prelate of the North|umbrian kingdom, gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to this &s;ubjection in the eighth cen|tury, by his making an appeal to Rome again&s;t the deci&s;ions of an Engli&s;h &s;y|nod,

which had abridged his dioce&s;e by the erection of &s;ome new bi&s;hoprics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to Bede, numb. 19. Higden. lib. 5. Matth. We&s;t. p. 124.

Agatho, the Pope, readily embraced this precedent of an appeal to his court; and Wilfrid, though the haughtie&s;t and mo&s;t luxurious prelate of his age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eddius vita Vilfr. &sect; 24, 60.</NOTE>, ha|ving obtained with the people the character of &s;anctity, finally prevailed in the conte&s;t. The great topic, by which he confounded the imaginations of men, was, that St. Peter, to who&s;e cu&s;tody the keys of heaven were entru&s;ted, would certainly refu&s;e admittance to every one who had been wanting in re&s;pect to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This conceit, well calculated for vulgar conceptions, had a powerful operation on the people during &s;everal ages; and has not even at pre&s;ent lo&s;t all influence in the catholic countries.</P>
<P>HAD this abject &s;uper&s;tition produced general peace and tranquillity, it had made &s;ome atonement for the ills attending it; but, added to the u&s;ual avidity of men for power and riches, it engendered frivolous controver&s;ies in theology, which were &s;o much the more fatal, as they admitted not, like the others, of any final determination from e&s;tabli&s;hed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The di&s;putes, excited in Britain, were of the mo&s;t ridiculous kind, and entirely worthy of tho&s;e ignorant and bar|barous ages.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE kingdoms of the Heptarchy, tho' united by &s;o recent a conque&s;t, &s;eemed to be &s;trongly cemented into one &s;tate under Egbert; and the in|habitants of the &s;everal provinces had lo&s;t all de&s;ire of revolting from that con|queror, or of re&s;toring their independent governments. Their language was every where nearly the &s;ame; their cu&s;toms, laws, in&s;titutions civil and religious; and as the race of their antient kings was totally extinct in all their &s;ubjected &s;tates, the people readily transferred their allegiance to a prince, who &s;eemed to merit it, by the &s;plendor of his victories, the vigor of his admini&s;tration, and the &s;uperior nobility of his birth. An union al&s;o in government opened to them the agreeable pro&s;pect of future tranquillity; and it appeared more probable, that they would thenceforth become terrible to their neighbours, than be expo&s;ed to their inroads and deva&s;tations. But the&s;e flattering views were &s;oon overca&s;t by the appearance of the Danes, who, during &s;ome centuries, kept the Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquietude, committed the mo&s;t barbarous ravages upon them, and at la&s;t reduced them to the mo&s;t grievous &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charlemagne, tho' naturally generous and humane, had been induced by bigotry to exerci&s;e great &s;everities again&s;t the pagan Saxons in Ger|many, whom he &s;ubdued; and be&s;ides often ravaging their country by fire and &s;word, he had in cold blood decimated all the inhabitants for their revolts, and had obliged them, by the mo&s;t rigorous edicts, to make a &s;eeming compliance with the chri&s;tian doctrine. That religion, which had ea&s;ily made its way among the Briti&s;h-Saxons by in&s;inuation and addre&s;s, appeared &s;hocking to their German brethren, when impo&s;ed on them by the violence of Charlemagne; and the mo&s;t generous and warlike of the&s;e pagans had fled northward into Jutland, in order to e&s;cape the fury of his per&s;ecutions. Meeting there with a people of &s;imilar manners, they were readily received among them; and they &s;oon &s;timu|lated

the natives to concur in enterprizes, which both promi&s;ed revenge on the haughty conquerors, and afforded &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to tho&s;e numerous inhabitants, with which the northern countries were now overburthened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;tria, p. 414.</NOTE>. They invaded the provinces of France, which were expo&s;ed by the degeneracy and di&s;&s;en&s;ions of Charlemagne's po&s;terity; and being known there under the general name of Nor|mans, which they received from their northern &s;ituation, they became the terror of all the maritime and even of the inland countries. They were al&s;o tempted to vi&s;it England in their frequent excur&s;ions; and being able by &s;udden inroads to make great progre&s;s over a people, who were not defended by any naval force, who had relaxed their military in&s;titutions, and who were &s;unk into a &s;uper&s;tition, which had become odious to the Danes and antient Saxons, they made no di&s;|tinction in their ho&s;tilities between the French and Engli&s;h kingdoms.

A &s;mall body of them landed in that kingdom, with a view of learning the &s;tate of the country; and when the magi&s;trate of the place que&s;tioned them concerning the rea&s;on of their enterprize, and cited them to appear before the king, and account for their intentions, they killed him, and flying to their &s;hips, e&s;caped into their own country.

<P>AFTER Alfred had &s;ubdued and &s;ettled or expelled the Danes, he found the kingdom in the mo&s;t wretched condition; lying in de&s;olation from the ravages of tho&s;e barbarians, and thrown into di&s;orders, which were calculated to per|petuate

its mi&s;ery. Tho' the great armies of the Danes were broke, the country was full of &s;traggling troops of that nation, who, being accu&s;tomed to live by plunder, were become incapable of indu&s;try, and who, from the natural ferocity of their manners, indulged them&s;elves in the commi&s;&s;ion of violence, even be|yond what was requi&s;ite to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities. The Engli&s;h them&s;elves, reduced to the mo&s;t extreme indigence by the&s;e continued depredations, had &s;haken off all bands of government; and tho&s;e who had been plundered to-day, betook them&s;elves to a like di&s;orderly life, and from de&s;pair joined next day the robbers in pillaging and ruining their fellow citizens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W.

Ten neighbouring hou&s;eholders were formed into one corporation, who, under the name of a tything, decennary, or fribourg, were an&s;werable for each other's conduct, and over whom one per&s;on, called a tything|man, headbourg, or bor&s;holder, was appointed to pre&s;ide.

Thirty-one days were allowed them for producing the criminal; and if that time elap&s;ed without their being able to find him, the bor&s;holder, with two other members of the decennary, was obliged to appear, and together with three chief members of the three neighbouring decen|naries making twelve in all to &s;wear that his decennary was free from all privity both of the crime committed, and of the e&s;cape of the criminal. If the bor&s;|holder could not find &s;uch a number to an&s;wer for their innocence, the decennary was compelled by fine to make &s;atisfaction to the King, according to the degree

<P>SUCH a regular di&s;tribution of the people, and &s;uch a &s;trict confinement in their habitation, may not be nece&s;&s;ary in times, when men are more enured to obe|dience and ju&s;tice, and might perhaps be regarded as de&s;tructive of liberty and commerce in a poli&s;hed &s;tate; but were well calculated to reduce the&s;e fierce and licentious people under the &s;alutary re&s;traint of law and government. But Alfred took care to temper the&s;e rigors by other in&s;titutions favourable to the freedom and &s;ecurity of the citizens; and nothing could be more popular and liberal than his plan for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The bor&s;holder &s;ummoned together his whole decennary to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in deciding any le&s;&s;er differences, which occurred among the members of this &s;mall community. In affairs of greater mo|ment, in appeals from the decennary, or in controver&s;ies ari&s;ing between mem|bers of different decennaries, the cau&s;e was brought before the hundred, which con&s;i&s;ted of ten decennaries, or a hundred families of freemen, and which was re|gularly a&s;&s;embled once in four weeks, for the deciding of cau&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Leg.

Formerly, the alderman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both the civil and military authority; but Alfred, &s;en&s;ible that this coalition of powers rendered the nobility dangerous and independant, appointed al&s;o a &s;heriff in each county; who enjoyed a co-ordinate anthority with the former in the judicial function<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ingulf. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>.

<P>THE better to guide the magi&s;trates in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, Alfred framed a body of laws; which, tho' now lo&s;t, &s;erved long as the ba&s;is of Eng|li&s;h juri&s;prudence, and is generally e&s;teemed the origin of what is denominated the COMMON LAW. He appointed regular meetings of the &s;tates of England twice a year in London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mirroir des Ju&s;tices.</NOTE>; a city which he him&s;elf had repaired and beautified, and which he thus rendered the capital of the kingdom. The &s;imilarity of many of the&s;e in&s;titutions to the cu&s;toms of the antient Germans, to the practice of the other northern conquerors, and to the Saxon laws during the Heptarchy, pre|vents us from regarding Alfred as the &s;ole author of this plan of government; and leads us rather to think, that, like a wi&s;e man, he contented him&s;elf with re|forming, extending, and executing the in&s;titutions, which he found previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>As good morals and knowledge are almo&s;t in&s;eparable, in every age, tho' not in every individual; the care of Alfred for the encouragement of learning among his &s;ubjects was another u&s;eful branch of his legi&s;lation, and tended to reform the Engli&s;h from their former di&s;&s;olute and barbarous manners: But the King was guided in this pur&s;uit le&s;s by his political views, than by his natural bent and propen&s;ity towards letters.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE &s;tain in this prince's birth was not, in tho&s;e times, deemed &s;o con|&s;iderable as to exclude him from the throne; and Athel&s;tan, being of an age, as well as of a capacity, fitted for government, obtained the preference to Edward's younger children, who, tho' legitimate, were of too tender years to rule a nation &s;o much expo&s;ed both to foreign inva&s;ion and to dome&s;tic convul|&s;ions. Some di&s;contents, however, prevailed on his acce&s;&s;ion; and Alfred, a nobleman of con&s;iderable power, was thence encouraged to enter into a con&s;pi|racy again&s;t him. This event is related by hi&s;torians with circum&s;tances, which the reader, according to the degree of credit he is di&s;po&s;ed to give them, may impute, either to the invention of monks, who forged them, or to their artifice, who found means to make them real. Alfred, it is &s;aid, being &s;eized upon &s;trong &s;u&s;picions, but without any certain proof, firmly denied the con&s;piracy imputed to him; and in order to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, he offered to &s;wear to his innocence before the Pope, who&s;e per&s;en, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, contained &s;uch &s;uperior &s;anctity, that no one could pre&s;ume to give a fal&s;e oath in his pre&s;ence, and yet hope to e&s;cape the immediate vengeance of heaven. The King accepted of the condition, and Al|fred was conducted to Rome; where, either con&s;cious of his innocence, or ne|glecting the &s;uper&s;tition, to which he appealed, he ventured to make the oath re|quired of him, before John, who then filled the papal chair. But no &s;ooner had he pronounced the fatal words, than he fell into convul&s;ions, of which in three days after he expired. The King, as if the guilt of the con&s;pirator were now fully a&s;certained, confi&s;cated his e&s;tate, and made a pre&s;ent of it to the mona&s;tery of Malme&s;bury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W.

<P>THERE is a circum&s;tance, not unworthy of notice, which hi&s;torians relate with regard to the tran&s;actions of this war. Anlaf, on the approach of the Engli&s;h army, thought, that he could not venture too much to en&s;ure a fortunate event; and employing the artifice formerly practi&s;ed by Alfred again&s;t the Danes, he entered the enemy's camp in the habit of a min&s;trel. The &s;tratagem was for the pre&s;ent attended with a like &s;ucce&s;s. He gave &s;uch &s;atisfaction to the &s;oldiers, who flocked about him, that they introduced him to the King's tent; and An|laf, having played before that prince and his nobles during their repa&s;t, was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed with a hand&s;ome reward. His prudence kept him from refu&s;ing the pre|&s;ent; but his pride determined him, on his departure, to bury it, while he fan|cied that he was une&s;pied by all the world. But a &s;oldier in Athel&s;tan's camp, who had formerly &s;erved under Anlaf, had been &s;truck with &s;ome &s;u&s;picion on the fir&s;t appearance of the min&s;trel; and was engaged by curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve all his motions. He regarded this la&s;t action as a full proof of Anlaf's di&s;gui&s;e; and he immediately carried the intelligence to Athel&s;tan, who blamed him for not &s;ooner giving him information, that he might have &s;eized his enemy. But the &s;oldier told him, that as he had formerly &s;worn fealty to Anlaf, he could never have pardoned him&s;elf the treachery of betraying and ruining his antient ma&s;ter; and that Athel&s;tan him&s;elf, after &s;uch an in&s;tance of his criminal conduct, would have equal rea&s;on to doubt of his allegiance. Athel&s;tan, having prai&s;ed the ge|nero&s;ity of the &s;oldier's principles, reflected on the incident, which he fore&s;aw might be attended with important con&s;equences. He removed his &s;tation in the camp; and as a bi&s;hop arrived that evening with a reinforcement of troops, (for the eccle&s;ia&s;tics were then no le&s;s warlike than the civil magi&s;trates) he occupied with his train that very place which had been left vacant by the King's removal. The precaution of Athel&s;tan was found prudent: For no &s;ooner had darkne&s;s fallen, than Anlaf broke into the camp, and ha&s;tening directly to the place where he had left the King's tent, put the bi&s;hop to death, before he had time to pre|pare for his de ence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE reign of this prince, as that of his predece&s;&s;ors, was di&s;turbed by the rebellions and incur&s;ions of the Northumbrian Danes, who, tho' frequently quelled, were never entirely &s;ubdued, nor had ever paid a &s;incere allegiance to the crown of England. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a new King &s;eemed to them a favour|able opportunity for &s;haking off the yoke; but on Edred's appearance with an army, they made him their wonted &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions; and the King having wa&s;ted the country with fire and &s;word, as a puni&s;hment of their rebellion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 423. Wallingford, p. 541.</NOTE>, obliged them to renew their oaths of allegiance; and he &s;trait returned with his forces. The obedience of the Danes la&s;ted no longer than the pre&s;ent terror. Provoked at the deva&s;tations of Edred, and even reduced by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on plunder, they broke into a new rebellion, and were again &s;ubdued<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423.</NOTE>: But the King, now in&s;tructed by experience, took better precautions again&s;t their future revolt.

<P>EDRED, tho' not unwarlike, nor unfit for active life, lay under the influence of the lowe&s;t &s;uper&s;tition, and had blindly delivered over his con&s;cience to the guidance of Dun&s;tan, commonly called St. Dun&s;tan, abbot of Gla&s;tenbury<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

Taking advan|tage of the implicit faith repo&s;ed in him by the King, this churchman imported into England a new order of monks, who much changed the &s;tate of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and excited, on their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, the mo&s;t violent commotions.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83">
FROM the time of the fir&s;t introduction of Chri&s;tianity among the Saxons, there had been mona&s;teries in England; and the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments had extremely multiplied, by the donations of the princes and nobles; who&s;e &s;uper&s;tition, derived from their ignorance and precarious life, and encrea&s;ed by remor&s;es for the crimes into which they were &s;o frequently betrayed, knew no other expedient for appea&s;ing the Deity than a profu&s;e liberality towards the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. But the monks had hitherto been a &s;pecies of &s;ecular prie&s;ts, who lived in the convents after the man|ner of the pre&s;ent canons or prebendaries, and were both intermingled, in &s;ome degree, with the world, and endeavoured to render them&s;elves u&s;eful to it. They were employed in the education of youth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne in Anglia Sacra, tom. 2. p 92.</NOTE>: They had the di&s;po&s;al of their own time and indu&s;try: They were not &s;ubjected to the rigid rules of an order: They had made no vows of implicit obedience to their &s;uperiors<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 91.</NOTE>: And they &s;till retained the choice, without quitting the convent, either of a married or a &s;ingle life<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Wharton's notes to Anglia Sacra, tom 2. p. 91. Gervas, p. 1645. Chron. Wint. MS. apud Spell. Conc. p. 434.</NOTE>. But a mi&s;taken piety had produced in Italy a new &s;pecies of monks, called Benedictines; who, carrying farther the plau&s;ible principles of mortification, &s;ecluded them&s;elves entirely from the world, renounced all claim to liberty, and made a merit of the mo&s;t inviolable cha&s;tity. The&s;e practices and principles, which &s;uper&s;tition at fir&s;t engendered, were greedily embraced and promoted by the policy of the court of Rome. The Roman pontiff, who was making every day great advances towards an univer&s;al &s;overeignty over the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, perceived, that the celibacy alone of the clergy could break off en|tirely their connexion with the civil power, and depriving them of every other object of ambition, engage them to promote, with uncea&s;ing indu&s;try, the gran|deur of their own order. He was &s;en&s;ible, that &s;o long as the monks were in|dulged in marriage, and were allowed families, they never could be &s;ubjected to a &s;trict rule, or reduced to that &s;lavery under their &s;uperiors, which was requi&s;ite to procure to the orders, i&s;&s;ued from Rome, a ready and zealous obedience. Celibacy, therefore, began to be extolled, as the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of prie&s;ts; and the Pope undertook to make all the clergy throughout the we&s;tern world re|nounce at once the privilege of marriage: A fortunate policy, but at the &s;ame time an undertaking the mo&s;t difficult of any, &s;ince he had the &s;tronge&s;t propen|&s;ities of human nature to encounter, and found, that the &s;ame connexions with the female &s;ex, which generally encourages devotion, was here unfavourable to the &s;ucce&s;s of his project. It is no wonder, therefore, that this ma&s;ter &s;troke of art &s;hould have met with violent contradiction, and that the intere&s;ts of the hie|rarchy,
<PB N="78" REF="84">
and the inclinations of the prie&s;ts, being now placed in this &s;ingular op|po&s;ition, &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding the continued efforts of Rome, have retarded the execution of that bold &s;cheme, during the cour&s;e of near three centuries.</P>
<P>As the bi&s;hops and parochial clergy lived apart with their families, and were more connected with the world, the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s with them were fainter, and the pretence for making them renounce marriage was much le&s;s plau&s;ible. But the pope, having ca&s;t his eye on the monks as the ba&s;is of his authority, was determined to reduce them under &s;trict rules of obedience, to procure them the credit of &s;anctity by an appearance of the mo&s;t rigid mortifications, and to break off all their other connections which might interfere with his &s;piritual policy. Under pretence, therefore, of reforming abu&s;es, which were, in &s;ome degree, unavoidable in the antient e&s;tabli&s;hments, he had already &s;pread over the &s;outhern countries of Europe the &s;trict rules of the mona&s;tic life, and began to form at|tempts towards a like innovation in England. The favourable opportunity of|fered it&s;elf (and it was greedily &s;eized) ari&s;ing from the weak &s;uper&s;tition of Edred, and the violent impetuous character of Dun&s;tan.</P>
<P>DUNSTAN was born of noble parents in the we&s;t of England; and being educated under his uncle, Aldhelm, then Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, had be|taken him&s;elf to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical life, and had acquired &s;ome character in the court of Edmund. He was, however, defamed to that prince as a man of li|centious manners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 95. Math. We&s;t. p. 187.</NOTE>; and finding his fortune bla&s;ted by the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, his ardent ambition prompted him to repair his indi&s;cretions by running into an oppo&s;ite extreme. He &s;ecluded him&s;elf entirely from the world; he framed a cell &s;o &s;mall that he could neither &s;tand erect in it, nor &s;tretch out his limbs during his re|po&s;e; and he here employed him&s;elf perpetually either in devotion or in manual labour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 96.</NOTE>. It is probable, that his brain became gradually crazed by the&s;e &s;oli|tary occupations, and that he framed chimeras, which, being believed by him&s;elf and his &s;tupid votaries, procured him the general character of &s;anctity among the people. He fancied, that the devil, among the frequent vi&s;its, which he paid him, was one day more earne&s;t than u&s;ual in his temptations; till Dun|&s;tan, provoked at his importunity, &s;eized him by the no&s;e with a pair of red-hot pincers, as he put his head into the cell; and he held him there, till that ma|lignant &s;pirit made the whole neighbourhood re&s;ound with his bellowings. This notable exploit was &s;eriou&s;ly credited and extolled by the public; it is tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity by one who, con&s;idering his age, may pa&s;s for a writer of &s;ome ele|gance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 97.</NOTE>; and it in&s;ured to Dun&s;tan a reputation, which no real piety, much le&s;s
<PB N="79" REF="85">
virtue, could, even in the mo&s;t enlightened period, have ever been able to procure him with the people.</P>
<P>SUPPORTED by the character, obtained in his retreat, Dun&s;tan appeared again at court; and gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over Edred, who had &s;ucceeded to the crown, as made him, not only the director of his con&s;cience, but his coun&s;ellor in the mo&s;t momentous affairs of government. He was placed at the head of the trea&s;ury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 102. Wallingford, p. 541.</NOTE>, and being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both of power at court, and of credit with the populace, he was enabled to attempt with &s;ucce&s;s the mo&s;t arduous under|takings. Finding, that his advancement had been owing to the opinion of his au&s;terity, he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a partizan of the rigid mona&s;tic rules; and after introducing that reformation into the convents of Gla&s;tenbury and Abingdon, he endeavoured to render it univer&s;al in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE minds of men were already well prepared for this innovation. The prai&s;es of an inviolable cha&s;tity had been carried to the highe&s;t extravagance by &s;ome of the fir&s;t preachers of chri&s;tianity among the Saxons: The plea&s;ures of love had been repre&s;ented as incompatible with chri&s;tian perfection: And a total ab|&s;tinence from all commerce with the &s;ex was deemed &s;uch a meritorious pennance, as was &s;ufficient to atone for the greate&s;t enormities. The con&s;equence &s;eemed natural, that tho&s;e at lea&s;t who officiated at the altar &s;hould be clear of this pol|lution; and when the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which was now creeping in<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 452.</NOTE>, was once fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, the reverence to the real body of Chri&s;t in the euchari&s;t, be&s;towed on this argument an additional force and influence. The monks knew how to avail them&s;elves of all the&s;e popular topics, and to &s;et off their own character to the be&s;t advantage. They affected the greate&s;t au&s;terity of life and manners: They indulged them&s;elves in the highe&s;t &s;trains of devotion: They inveighed bitterly again&s;t the vices and pretended luxury of the age: They were particularly vehement again&s;t the di&s;&s;olute lives of the &s;ecular clergy, their rivals: Every particular in&s;tance of libertini&s;m in that order was repre&s;ented as a general corruption: And where other topics of defamation were wanting, their marriage became a &s;ure object of invective, and their wives received the name of <HI>concubines,</HI> or other more opprobrious appellation. The &s;ecular clergy, on the other hand, who were numerous and rich, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dig|nities, defended them&s;elves with vigour, and endeavoured to retaliate upon their adver&s;aries. The people were thrown into agitation; and few in&s;tances occur of more violent di&s;&s;entions, excited by the mo&s;t material differences in religion; or rather by the mo&s;t frivolous: Since it is a general remark, that the more
<PB N="80" REF="86">
affinity there is between thological parties, the greater commonly is their ani|mo&s;ity.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of the monks, which was become con&s;iderable, was &s;omewhat retarded by the death of Edred, their partizan, who expired after a reign of nine years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron Sax. p 115.</NOTE>.

<P>IN order to complete the great work of placing the new order of monks in all the convents, Edgar &s;ummoned a general council of the prelates and the heads of the religious orders.

before the monks prevailed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their new rules in almo&s;t all the con|vents.</P>
<P>WE may remark, that the declamations again&s;t the &s;ecular clergy are both here and in all the hi&s;torians, conveyed in general terms; and as that order of men are commonly re&s;trained by the decency of their character, not to mention &s;uperior motives, it is difficult to believe, that the complaints again&s;t their di&s;&s;o|lute manners could be &s;o univer&s;ally ju&s;t as is pretended. It is more probable, that the monks paid court to the populace by an affected au&s;terity of life; and, repre&s;enting the mo&s;t innocent liberties, taken by the other clergy, as great and unpardonable enormities, thereby prepared the way for the increa&s;e of their own power and influence. Edgar, however, like a true politician, con|curred with the prevailing party; and he even indulged them in preten&s;ions, which, tho' they might, when complied with, engage the monks to &s;upport royal authority during his own reign, proved afterwards very dangerous to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and gave di&s;turbance to the whole civil power. He &s;econded the policy of the court of Rome, in granting to &s;ome mona&s;teries an exemption from epi&s;copal juri&s;diction: He allowed the convents, even tho&s;e of royal foundation, to u&s;urp the election of their own abbot: And he admitted their forgeries of an|tient charters, by which, from the pretended grant of former kings, they a&s;|&s;umed like privileges and exemptions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P>THESE merits of Edgar have procured him the highe&s;t panegyrics from tho monks; and he is tran&s;mitted to us not only under the character of a great poli|tician and an active prince, prai&s;es to which he &s;eems to have been intitled, but under that of a great &s;aint and a man of virtue.

Yet tho&s;e very monks, who, as we are told by Ingulf, a very antient hi&s;torian, had no idea of any moral or religious merit, except cha&s;tity and obedience, not only connived at his enor|mities, but loaded him with the highe&s;t prai&s;es.

<P>THERE was another mi&s;tre&s;s of Edgar, called Elfleda, with whom he fir&s;t formed a connexion by a kind of accident. Pa&s;&s;ing one day by Andover, he lodged in the hou&s;e of a nobleman, who&s;e daughter, being endowed with all the graces of per&s;on and behaviour, enflamed him at fir&s;t &s;ight with the highe&s;t de|&s;ire, and made him re&s;olve by any expedient to gratify it. As he had not lei&s;ure to employ court&s;hip or addre&s;s for attaining his purpo&s;e, he went directly to her mother, ceclared the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ired that the young lady might be allowed to pa&s;s that very night with him. The mother was a woman of virtue, and determined not to di&s;honour her daughter and her family by com|pliance; but bring well acquainted with the impetuo&s;ity of the King's temper, &s;he thought it would be ea&s;ier, as well as &s;afer, to deceive than refu&s;e him. She feigned therefore a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will; but &s;ecretly ordered a waiting maid, of no di&s;agreeable figure, to &s;teal into the King's bed, after all the company &s;hould be retired to re&s;t. In the morning, before day break, the dam&s;el, agree|able to the injunctions of her mi&s;tre&s;s, offered to retire; but Edgar, who had no re&s;erve in his plea&s;ures, and who&s;e love to his bedfollow was rather enflamed by enjoyment, refu&s;ed his con&s;ent, and employed force and entreaties to detain her. Elfrida, tru&s;ting to her own charms, and to the love with which, &s;he hoped, &s;he had now in&s;pired the King, made probably but a faint re&s;i&s;tance; and the return of light di&s;covered the deceit to Edgar.

<P>THE circum&s;tances of his marriage with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> lady were more &s;ingular, and more criminal. Elfrida was daughter and heir of Olgar, earl of Devon&s;hire; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had been educated in the country, and had never appeared at court, &s;he had filled all England with the reputation of her beauty. Edgar him&s;elf, who
<PB N="87" REF="93">
was indifferent to no accounts of this nature, found his curio&s;ity excited by the frequent panegyrics which he heard of Elfrida; and reflecting on her noble birth, he re&s;olved, if he found her charms an&s;werable to their fame, to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of her on honourable terms. He communicated his intention to earl Ethel|wold, his favourite; but u&s;ed the precaution, before he made any advances to her parents, to order that nobleman, on &s;ome pretence, to pay them a vi&s;it, and to bring him a certain account of the beauty of their daughter. Ethelwold, when introduced to the young lady, found general report to have fallen much &s;hort of the truth; and being enflamed with the highe&s;t love, he determined to &s;acrifice to this new pa&s;&s;ion all his &s;idelity to his ma&s;ter, and to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. He returned to Edgar, and told him, that the riches alone, and high quality of Elfrida, had been the ground of the admiration paid her, and that her charms, far from being any wi&s;e extraordinary, would have been overlooked in a woman of interior &s;tation. When he had, by this deceit, turned the King from his pur|po&s;e, he took an opportunity, after &s;ome interval, of turning again the conver&s;a|tion on Elfrida; and he remarked, that, tho' the parentage and fortune of the lady had not produced on him, as on others, any illu&s;ion with regard to her beauty, he could not forbear reflecting, that &s;he would on the whole be an ad|vantageous match for him, and might, by her birth and riches, make him a &s;uf|ficient compen&s;ation for the homeline&s;s of her per&s;on. If the King, therefore, gave his approbation to the de&s;ign, he was determined to make propo&s;als in his own benalf to the earl of Devon&s;hire, and doubted not to obtain his, as well as the young lady's, con&s;ent to the marriage. Edgar, plea&s;ed with an expedient for e&s;tabli&s;hing his favourite's fortune, not only exhorted him to execute his pur|po&s;e, but forwarded its &s;ucce&s;s by his recommendations to the parents of Elfrida; and Athelwold was &s;oon made happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Dreading, however, the detection of the artifice, he employed every pretence for detaining Elfrida in the country, and for keeping her at a di&s;tance from Edgar.</P>
<P>THE violent pa&s;&s;ion of Athelwold had concealed from him the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quences which mu&s;t attend his conduct, and the advantages which the numerous enemies that always pur&s;ue a royal favourite, would, by its means, be able to make again&s;t him. Edgar was &s;oon informed of the truth; but before he would execute vengeance on Athelwold's treachery, he re&s;olved to &s;atisfy him&s;elf with his own eyes of the certainty and full extent of his guilt. He told him, that he in|tended to pay him a vi&s;it in his ca&s;tle, and be introduced to the acquaintance of his new married wife; and Athelwold, as he could not refu&s;e this honour, beg|ged only leave to go before him a few hours, that he might the better prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re every thing for his reception. He then di&s;covered the whole matter to Elfrida;
<PB N="88" REF="94">
and begged her, if &s;he had any regard, either to her own honour or to his life, to conceal from Edgar, by every circum&s;tance of dre&s;s and behaviour, that fatal beauty, which had &s;educed him from fidelity to his friend, and had betrayed him into &s;o many fal&s;ehoods.

<P>BEFORE we conclude our account of this reign, we mu&s;t mention two circum|&s;tances, which are remarked by hi&s;torians. The reputation of Edgar allured a great number of foreigners to vi&s;it his court; and he gave them encouragement to re&s;ide in England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 116. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 356. Brompton, p. 865.</NOTE>. We are told, that they imported all the vices of their re&s;pective countries, and contributed to corrupt the &s;imple manners of the na|tives<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 8.</NOTE>: But as this &s;implicity of manners, &s;o highly and often &s;o injudiciou&s;ly extolled, pre&s;erved them not from barbarity and treachery, the greate&s;t of all vices, and the mo&s;t incident to a rude uncultivated people, we ought perhaps to deem their acquaintance with foreigners rather an advantage; as it tended to enlarge their views, and to cure them of tho&s;e illiberal prejudices and ru&s;tic manners, to which i&s;landers are often &s;ubject.</P>
<P>ANOTHER remarkable incident of this reign was the extirpation of wolves from England. This advantage was attained by the indu&s;trious policy of Edgar. He took great pains in hunting and pur&s;uing tho&s;e ravenous animals; and when found, that they had all taken &s;helter in the mountains and fore&s;ts of Wales, he changed the tribute of money impo&s;ed on the Wel&s;h princes by Athel&s;tan, his predece&s;&s;or<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P>THE fir&s;t attempt of Rollo was on England, near the end of Alfred's reign; when that great monarch, having &s;ettled Guthrun and his followers in Ea&s;t-Anglia, and others of the&s;e free-booters in Northumberland, and having re&s;tored peace to his harra&s;&s;ed country, had e&s;tabli&s;hed the mo&s;t excellent military, as well as civil in&s;titutions among the Engli&s;h. The prudent Dane, finding that no ad|vantages could be gained over &s;uch a people, governed by &s;uch a prince, &s;oon turned his enterprizes again&s;t France, which he found more expo&s;ed to his inroads<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gul.

The French, having no means of defence again&s;t a a chieftain, who united all the valour of his countrymen with the policy of more civilized nations, were obliged to &s;ubmit to the expedient practi&s;ed by Alfred, and to offer the invaders a &s;ettlement in &s;ome of tho&s;e provinces, which they had depopulated by their arms<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dud&s;. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, why the Danes for many years pur&s;ued mea&s;ures &s;o different from tho&s;e embraced by the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Burgundians, Lombards, and other northern conquerors, was the great difference, in the method of attack which was practi&s;ed by the&s;e &s;everal nations, and to which the nature of their particular &s;ituations nece&s;&s;arily confined them. The latter tribes, living in an inland country, made incur&s;ions by land upon the Roman empire; and when they entered far into the frontiers, they were obliged to carry along with them their wives and families, whom they had no hopes of &s;oon re-vi&s;iting, and who could not otherwi&s;e participate of their plunder. This circum&s;tance quickly made them think of forcing a &s;ettlement in the provinces, which they had over-run; and the&s;e barbarians, &s;preading them&s;elves over the country, found an intere&s;t in protecting the property and indu&s;try of the people, whom they &s;ubdued. But the Danes and Norvegians, invited by their maritime &s;ituation, and obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves in their uncultivated country by fi&s;hing, had acquired &s;ome ex|perience of navigation; and in their military excur&s;ions pur&s;ued the method practi&s;ed again&s;t the Roman empire by the more early Saxons: They made de|&s;cents
<PB N="98" REF="104">
in &s;mall bodies from their &s;hips or rather boats, and ravaging the coa&s;ts, returned with the booty to their families, whom they could not conveniently carry along with them in the&s;e hazardous enterprizes. But when they increa&s;ed their armaments, made incur&s;ions into the inland countries, and found it &s;afe to remain longer in the mid&s;t of the enemy, they had been accu&s;tomed to crowd their ve&s;&s;els with their wives and children, and having no longer any temptation to return into their own country, they willingly embraced an opportunity of &s;et|tling in the warm climates and cultivated fields of the &s;outh.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS were in this &s;ituation with Rollo and his followers, when Charles propo&s;ed to relinqui&s;h to them the province formerly called Neu&s;tria, and to purcha&s;e peace of them on the&s;e hard conditions. After all the terms were fully agreed, there appeared only one circum&s;tance &s;hocking to the haughty Dane: He was required to do homage to Charles for his province, and to put him&s;elf in that humiliating po&s;ture, impo&s;ed on va&s;&s;als by the rites of the feudal law. He long refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to this indignity; but being unwilling to lo&s;e &s;uch important advantages for a mere ceremony, he made a &s;acrifice of his pride to his intere&s;t, and acknowledged him&s;elf in form the va&s;&s;al of the French mo|narch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 417.</NOTE>. Charles gave him his daughter, Gi&s;la, in marriage; and that he might bind him fa&s;ter to his intere&s;ts, made him a donation of a con&s;iderable territory, be&s;ides what he was obliged to &s;urrender to him by his &s;tipulations. When &s;ome of the French nobles informed him, that, in return for &s;o generous a pre&s;ent, it was expected, that he &s;hould throw him&s;elf at the King's feet, and make &s;uitable acknowledgments for his bounty; Rollo replied, that he would rather break off the whole treaty; and it was with &s;ome difficulty they could per&s;uade him to make that compliment by one of his captains. The Dane, commi&s;&s;ioned for this purpo&s;e, full of indignation at the order, and de&s;pi&s;ing &s;o unwarlike a prince, caught Charles by the foot, and pretending to carry it to his mouth, that he might ki&s;s it, overthrew him before all his courtiers. The French nation, &s;en|&s;ible of their pre&s;ent weakne&s;s, found it prudent to overlook this in&s;ult<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ROLLO, who was now in the decline of life, and was tired of wars and depre|dations, applied him&s;elf, with mature councils, to the &s;ettlement of his new acquired territory, which was thenceforth called Normandy; and he parcelled it out among his captains and followers. He followed in this partition the cu&s;toms of the feudal law, which was then univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;outhern countries of Europe, and which &s;uited the peculiar circum&s;tances of that age.

<P>THE Danes had been e&s;tabli&s;hed during a longer period, in England than in France; and tho' the &s;imilarity of their original language to that of the Saxons invited them to a more early coalition with the natives, they had found, as yet, &s;o little example of civilized manners among the Engli&s;h, that they retained all their antient ferocity, and valued them&s;elves only on their national character of mi|litary bravery. The recent, as well as more antient atchievements of their coun|trymen, tended to &s;u&s;tain this idea; and the Engli&s;h princes, particularly Athel&s;tan and Edgar, &s;en&s;ible of that &s;uperiority, had been accu&s;tomed to keep in pay bodies of Dani&s;h troops, who were quartered about the country, and committed many violences upon the inhabitants. The&s;e mercenaries had attained to &s;uch a height of luxury, according to the old Engli&s;h writers<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 547.</NOTE>, that they combed their hair once a day, bathed them&s;elves once a week, changed their cloaths frequently; and by all the&s;e arts of effeminacy, as well as by their mi|litary character, had rendered them&s;elves &s;o agreeable to the fair &s;ex, that they debauched the wives and daughters of the Engli&s;h, and had di&s;honoured many families. But what mo&s;t provoked the inhabitants; in&s;tead of defending them again&s;t invaders, they were ever ready to betray them to the foreign Danes, and to a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with all the &s;traggling parties of that nation.

<P><MILESTONE N="1041" UNIT="year"> THE Engli&s;h, on the death of Hardicanute, &s;aw a favourable opportunity offered for recovering their liberty, and for &s;haking off the Dani&s;h yoke, under which they had &s;o long laboured. Sweyn, King of Norway, the elde&s;t &s;on of Canute, was ab&s;ent; and as the two la&s;t kings had died without i&s;&s;ue, there appeared none of that race, whom the Danes could &s;upport as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne. Prince Edward was fortunately at court on his brother's demi&s;e; and tho' the de&s;cendants of Edmond Iron&s;ide were the true heirs of the Saxon family, yet their ab&s;ence in &s;o remote a country as Hungary, appeared a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their exclu&s;ion to a people like the Engli&s;h, &s;o little accu&s;tomed to ob|&s;erve a regular order in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their monarchs. All delays might be dangerous; and the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion mu&s;t ha&s;tily be embraced; while the Danes, without concert, without a leader, a&s;toni&s;hed at the pre&s;ent incident, and anxious only for their per&s;onal &s;afety, dared not to oppo&s;e the united voice of the whole nation.</P>
<P>BUT this concurrence of circum&s;tances in Edward's favour might have failed of its effect, had his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion been oppo&s;ed by Godwin, who&s;e power, alliances. and abilities gave him a great influence at all times, much more in tho&s;e &s;udden

emergencies, which always attend a revolution of government, and which, either &s;eized or neglected, commonly prove &s;o deci&s;ive. There were circum|&s;tances, which divided men's hopes and fears with regard to their expectations of Godwin's conduct. On the one hand, the credit of that nobleman lay chiefly in We&s;&s;ex, which was almo&s;t entirely peopled with Engli&s;h; and it was therefore pre&s;umed, that he would &s;econd the wi&s;hes of his people, in re&s;toring the Saxon line, and in humbling the Danes, from whom he, as well as they, had rea&s;on to dread, as they had already felt, the mo&s;t grievous oppre&s;&s;ions. On the other hand, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a declared animo&s;ity between Edward and Godwin, on ac|count of Alfred's murder; of which the latter had publicly been accu&s;ed by the prince, and which he might believe &s;o deep an offence, as could never, on ac|count of any &s;ub&s;equent merits, be &s;incerely pardoned. But their common friends here interpo&s;ed; and repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of their good corre&s;pondence, obliged them to lay a&s;ide all jealou&s;y and rancour, and concur in re&s;toring liberty to their native country. Godwin only &s;tipulated, that Edward, as a pledge of his &s;incere reconcilement, &s;hould promi&s;e to marry his daughter, Editha<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 80. H. Hunt. p. 365.

The Engli&s;h were unanimous and zealous in their re&s;olutions; the Danes were divided and di&s;pirited: Any &s;mall oppo&s;ition, which appeared in this a&s;&s;embly, was brow-beaten and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and Edward was crowned King, with the highe&s;t demon&s;trations of duty and affection<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P>THE triumph of the Engli&s;h, upon this &s;ignal and deci&s;ive advantage, was at fir&s;t attended with &s;ome in&s;ult and violence again&s;t the Danes; but the new King, by the mildne&s;s of his character, &s;oon reconciled the latter to his admini|&s;tration, and the di&s;tinction between the two nations gradually di&s;appeared. They were inter&s;per&s;ed with the Engli&s;h in mo&s;t of the provinces; they &s;poke nearly the &s;ame tongue; they differed little in their manners and laws; the prevalence of dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions in Denmark prevented, for a long time, any powerful inva|&s;ion from thence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the year 1046, the Danes made an inva&s;ion from twenty-five &s;hips, the only one we read of during this reign.

<P>THE popularity, which Edward enjoyed on his acce&s;&s;ion, was not de&s;troyed by the fir&s;t act of his admini&s;tration, the re&s;uming all the grants of his immediate predece&s;&s;ors; an attempt, which is commonly attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. The poverty of the crown convinced the nation, that this act of violence was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and as the lo&s;s fell chiefly on the Danes, who had obtained large grants from the late Kings, their countrymen, on account of their &s;ervices in &s;ubduing the kingdom, the Engli&s;h were rather plea&s;ed to &s;ee them reduced to their primitive poverty. The King's &s;everity al&s;o towards his mother the Queen dowager, tho' expo&s;ed to &s;ome more cen&s;ure, met not with very general di&s;approbation.

<P>THE Engli&s;h flattered them&s;elves, that, by the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward, they were delivered for ever from the dominion of foreigners; but they &s;oon found, that that evil was not yet entirely removed.

<P>THIS powerful nobleman, be&s;ides being duke or earl of We&s;&s;ex, had, annexed to his government, the counties of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex.

The exorbitant authority of this family was &s;up|ported by immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and powerful alliances; and the abilities, as well as ambition, of Godwin him&s;elf contributed to render it &s;till more dangerous. A prince of greater capacity and vigour than Edward would have found it diffi|cult to &s;upport the dignity of the crown under &s;uch circum&s;tances; and as the haughty temper of Godwin made him often forget the re&s;pect, due to his prince, Edward's animo&s;ity again&s;t him was grounded on per&s;onal as well as political con|&s;iderations, on recent as well as more antient injuries.

<P>THE mo&s;t popular pretence, on which Godwin could ground his di&s;contents again&s;t the King and his admini&s;tration, was to complain of the influence of the Normans in the government; and a declared oppo&s;ition had thence ari&s;en between him and the&s;e favourites.

Eu&s;tace, count of Bologne, having paid a vi&s;it to the King, pa&s;|&s;ed by Dover on his return; and one of his train, being refu&s;ed acce&s;s to a lodging, which had been a&s;&s;igned him, attempted to make his way by force, and he wounded the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e in the conte&s;t.

He hur|ried immediately to court; complained of the u&s;age he had met with; the King entered zealou&s;ly into the quarrel, and re&s;ented that a &s;tranger of &s;uch di&s;tinction, whom he had invited over to his court, &s;hould, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e, as he believed, have felt &s;o &s;en&s;ibly the in&s;olence and animo&s;ity of his people. He gave orders to Godwin, in who&s;e government Dover lay, to go immediately to the place, and to puni&s;h the inhabitants for the crime: But Godwin, who de|&s;ired rather to encourage, than repre&s;s, the popular di&s;content again&s;t foreigners, refu&s;ed obedience, and endeavoured to throw the whole blame on the count of Boulogne, and his retinue<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P>THE earl, perceiving a rupture to be unavoidable, and plea&s;ed to embark in a cau&s;e, where he was likely to be &s;upported by his countrymen, prepared for his own defence, or rather for an attack on Edward; and under pretence of repre&s;|&s;ing &s;ome di&s;orders on the Wel&s;h frontier, he &s;ecretly a&s;&s;embled a great army, and was approaching the King, who re&s;ided, without any military force, and without &s;u&s;picion, at Gloce&s;ter<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P><MILESTONE N="1055" UNIT="year"> THE death of Siward, duke of Northumberland, made the way &s;till more open to the ambition of that nobleman.

He &s;aw, that the great power and ambition of Harold had tempted him to think of obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne on the fir&s;t vacancy, and that Edgar, on account of his youth and inexperience, was very unfit to oppo&s;e the preten&s;ions of &s;o popular and enter|pri&s;ing a rival.

<P>THIS famous prince was natural &s;on of Robert, duke of Normandy, by Har|lotta, daughter of a tanner in Falai&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 910.</NOTE>, and was very early e&s;tabli&s;hed in that grandeur, from which his birth &s;eemed to have &s;et him at &s;o great a di&s;tance. While he was but nine years of age, his father had re&s;olved to undertake a pil|grimage to Jeru&s;alem; a fa&s;hionable act of devotion, which had taken place of the pilgrimages to Rome, and which, as it was attended with more difficulty and danger, and carried the&s;e religious adventurers to the fir&s;t &s;ources of Chri&s;ti|anity, appeared to them much more pious and meritorious. Before his depar|ture, he a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the dutchy; and informing them of his purpo&s;e, he engaged them to &s;wear allegiance to his natural &s;on, William, whom, as he had no legitimate i&s;&s;ue, he intended, in ca&s;e he &s;hould die in the pilgrimage, to leave &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his dominions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

As he was a prudent prince, he could not but for&s;ee the great inconveniencies which mu&s;t attend his journey, and this &s;ettle|ment of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; ari&s;ing from the natural turbulency of the great, the claims from other branches of the ducal family, and the power of the French monarch: But all the&s;e views were &s;uper&s;eded by the prevailing zeal for pilgrim|ages<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ypod.

<P>THIS prince, as he had apprehended, died in his pilgrimage; and the mino|rity of his &s;on was attended with all tho&s;e inconveniencies, which were unavoid|able in his &s;ituation. The licentious nobles, freed from the awe of &s;overeign au|thority, broke out into per&s;onal animo&s;ities again&s;t each other, and made the whole country a &s;cene of war and deva&s;tation<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">W.

But the great qua|lities, which he &s;oon di&s;played in the field and in the cabinet, gave encourage|ment to his friends, and &s;truck a terror into his enemies.

He forced the French King to grant him peace on rea&s;onable terms; he expelled all pretenders to the &s;overeignty; and he reduced his turbulent barons to pay &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority, and to &s;u&s;pend their mutual animo&s;ities. The natural &s;everity of his temper appeared in a rigorous admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and having found the happy effects of this plan of government, without which the laws in tho&s;e ages became totally im|potent, he e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a fixed maxim, that an inflexible conduct was the fir&s;t duty of a &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE tranquillity which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed in his dominions had given Wil|liam lei&s;ure to pay a vi&s;it to the King of England during the time of Godwin's bani&s;hment; and he was received in a manner &s;uitable to the great reputation which he had acquired, to the relation by which he was connected with Edward, and to the obligations which that prince had owed to his family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 442.

<P>HAROLD, mean while, proceeded, after a more open manner, in increa&s;ing his popularity, in e&s;tabli&s;hing his power, and in preparing the way for his ad|vancement on the fir&s;t vacancy of the throne; an event which, from the age and infirmities of the King, appeared not very di&s;tant.

He &s;ent, therefore, an amba&s;&s;ador to Guy, in order to demand the liberty of his pri&s;oner; and that nobleman, not daring to refu&s;e &s;o great a prince, put Harold into the hands of the Norman amba&s;&s;ador, who conducted him to Ro&uuml;en<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P>WHEN Harold found him&s;elf at liberty, his ambition &s;ugge&s;ted ca&s;ui&s;try &s;uffi|cient to ju&s;tify to him the violation of an oath, which had been extorted from him by fear, and which, if fulfilled, might be attended with the &s;ubjection of his native country to a foreign power.

Fortune, about this time, threw two incidents in his way, by which he was enabled to acquire gene|ral favour, and to increa&s;e the character, which he had already obtained, of vir|tue and capacity.</P>
<P>THE Wel&s;h, tho' a le&s;s formidable enemy than the Danes, had been long accu&s;tomed to infe&s;t the we&s;tern borders; and after committing &s;poil on the low countries, they u&s;ually made a ha&s;ty retreat into their mountains, where they were &s;heltered from the pur&s;uit of their enemies, and were ready to &s;eize the fir&s;t favourable opportunity of renewing their depredations. Griffith, their pre&s;ent prince, had much di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the&s;e incur&s;ions; and his name had be|come &s;o terrible to the Engli&s;h, that Harold found he could do nothing more

<P>TOSTI, the elder brother of Harold, had been created duke of Northumber|land; but being of a violent, tyrannical temper, had practi&s;ed &s;uch cruelty and inju&s;tice over the inhabitants, that they ro&s;e in rebellion again&s;t him, and chaced him from his government. Morcar and Edwin, two brothers, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great power in tho&s;e quarters, and who were grand&s;ons of the great duke, Leof|ric, concurred in the in&s;urrection; and the former, being elected duke, ad|vanced with an army, to oppo&s;e Harold, who was commi&s;&s;ioned by the King to reduce and puni&s;h the Northumbrians. Before the armies came to action, Morcar, well acquainted with the generous di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h commander, endeavoured to ju&s;tify his conduct; and repre&s;ented to him, that To&s;ti had be|haved in a manner unworthy of the &s;tation to which he was advanced, and no one, not even a brother, could &s;upport &s;uch tyranny, without participating, in &s;ome degree, of the infamy attending it; that the Northumbrians, accu&s;tomed to a legal admini&s;tration, and regarding it as their birth-right, were willing to &s;ubmit to the King, but required a governor who would pay regard to their rights and privileges; that they had been taught by their ance&s;tors, that death was preferable to &s;ervitude, and had come to the field determined to peri&s;h, rather than bear a renewal of tho&s;e indignities, to which they had been &s;o long expo&s;ed; and they tru&s;ted, that Harold, on reflection, would not defend in another that violent con|duct, from which, in his own government, he had always kept at &s;o great a di&s;|tance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 283.</NOTE>. This vigorous remon&s;trance was accompanied with &s;uch a detail of facts, &s;o well &s;upported, that Harold found it prudent to abandon his brother's cau&s;e; and returning to Edward, he per&s;uaded him to pardon the Northumbrians, and to confirm Morcar in the government<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P>By this marriage, Harold broke all mea&s;ures with the duke of Normandy; and William clearly perceived, that he could no longer rely on the oaths and promi&s;es, which he had extorted from him. But the Engli&s;h nobleman thought him&s;elf now in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary for him to di&s;&s;emble. He had in his conduct again&s;t the Northumbrians, given &s;uch a &s;pecimen of his moderation as had gained him the affections of his countrymen. He &s;aw, that almo&s;t all England was under the command of him&s;elf or his friends; while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the government of We&s;&s;ex, Morcar that of Northumberland, and Edwin that of Mercia. He now openly a&s;pired to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and in&s;i&s;ted, that, &s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary, by the confe&s;&s;ion of all, to &s;et a&s;ide the royal family, on account of the imbecillity of Edgar, the &s;ole &s;urviving heir, there was no one &s;o capable of filling the throne, as a noble|man, of great power, of mature age, of long experience, of approved courage and ability, who being a native of the kingdom, would effectually &s;ecure it again&s;t the dominion and tyranny of foreigners. Edward, broken with age and infir|mities, &s;aw the difficulties too great for him to encounter; and tho' his inveterate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions kept him from &s;econding the preten&s;ions of Harold, he took but feeble and irre&s;olute &s;teps for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the duke of Normandy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The whole &s;tory of the tran&s;actions between Edward, Harold, and the duke of Normandy is told &s;o differently by the antient writers, that there are few important pa&s;&s;ages of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory liable to &s;o great uncertainty. I have followed the account, which appeared to me the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent and pro|bable. It does not &s;eem likely, that Edward ever executed a will in the duke's favour, much le&s;s that he got it ratified by the &s;tates of the kingdom, as is affirmed by &s;ome. The will would have been known to all, and would have been produced by the Conqueror to whom it gave &s;o plau&s;ible, and really &s;o ju&s;t a title; but the doubtful and ambiguous manner in which he &s;eems always to have men|tioned it, proves, that he could only plead the known intentions of that monarch in his favour, which he was de&s;irous to call a will. There is indeed a charter of the Conqueror, pre&s;erved by Dr. Hickes, vol. 1. where he calls him&s;elf <HI>rex hereditarius,</HI> meaning heir by will; but a prince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much power, and attended with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, may employ what pretences he plea&s;es: It is &s;uf|ficient to refute his pretences to ob&s;erve, that there is a great diffidence and variation among the hi&s;to|rians with regard to a point, which, had it been real, mu&s;t have been agreed upon by all of them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;ome hi&s;torians, particularly Malme&s;bury and Matthew We&s;tmin&s;ter, affirm that Harold had no intention of going over to Normandy, but that taking the air in a plea&s;ure-boat on the coa&s;t, he was driven over by &s;tre&s;s of weather to the territories of Guy count of Ponthieu: But be&s;ides that this &s;tory is not probable in it&s;elf, and is contradicted by mo&s;t of the antient hi&s;torians, it is refuted by a very curious and authentic monument lately di&s;covered. It is a tape&s;try, pre&s;erved in the ducal pa|lace of Rouen, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been wrought by orders of Matilda, wife to the Emperor: At lea&s;t it is of very great antiquity. Harold is there repre&s;ented as taking his departure from K. Edward in execution of &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion, and mounting his ve&s;&s;el with a great train. The de&s;ign of redeem|ing his brother and nephew, who were ho&s;tages, is the mo&s;t likely cau&s;e that can be a&s;&s;igned; and is accordingly mentioned by Eadmer, Hoveden, Brompton, and Simeon of Durham. For a farther account of this piece of tape&s;try, &s;ee Hi&s;toire de l'Academie de Literature, tom. IX. page 535.</P></NOTE>. While he continued in this uncertainty, he was &s;urprized by &s;ickne&s;s, which
<PB N="128" REF="134">
brought him to his grave, on the fifth of January 1066, in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.</P>
<P>THIS prince, to whom the monks gave the title of &s;aint and confe&s;&s;or, was the la&s;t of the Saxon line, who ruled in England; and tho' his reign was peace|able and fortunate, he owed this pro&s;perity le&s;s to his own ability than to the conjunctures of the times. The Danes, employed in other enterprizes, at|tempted not tho&s;e incur&s;ions, which had been &s;o trouble&s;ome to all his prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and fatal to &s;ome of them. The facility of his di&s;po&s;ition made him acquie&s;ce under the government of Godwin and his &s;on Harold; and the capacity, as well as the power of the&s;e noblemen, enabled them, while they were intru&s;ted with authority, to pre&s;erve dome&s;tic peace and tranquillity. The mo&s;t commendable circum&s;tance of Edward's government was his attention to the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and his compiling for that purpo&s;e a body of laws, which he collected from the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, and Alfred. This compilation, tho' now lo&s;t (for the laws that pa&s;s under Edward's name were compo&s;ed after|wards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spelm. in verbo <HI>Bailiva.</HI></NOTE>) were long the objects of affection to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>EDWARD the Confe&s;&s;or was the fir&s;t who touched for the King's evil: The opinion of his &s;anctity procured belief to this cure among the people; and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors regarded it as a part of their power and grandeur to uphold the &s;ame opinion. It has been continued down to our time; and the practice was fir&s;t dropped by the pre&s;ent royal family, who ob&s;erved, that it could no longer give amazement even to the populace, and was attended with ridicule in the eyes of all men of under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of danger, which the King di&s;covered, came from abroad, and from his own brother, To&s;ti, who had &s;ubmitted to a voluntary bani&s;hment in Flanders. Enraged at the &s;ucce&s;sful ambition of Harold, to which he him&s;elf had fallen a &s;acrifice, he filled the court of Baldwin with complaints of the in|ju&s;tice, which he had &s;uffered: He engaged the intere&s;t of that family again&s;t his brother: He endeavoured to form intrigues with &s;ome malcontent nobi|lity of England: He &s;ent his emi&s;&s;aries to Norway, in order to rouze to arms the freebooters of that kingdom, and excite their hopes of reaping advantage from the un&s;ettled &s;tate of affairs on the u&s;urpation of the new King: And that he might render the combination more formidable, he made a journey to Nor|mandy; in expectation, that the duke, who had married Matilda, another daughter of Baldwin, would, in revenge of his own injuries, as well as tho&s;e of To&s;ti, &s;econd, by his councils and forces, the projected inva&s;ion of England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Order Vitalis, p. 492.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Normandy, when he fir&s;t received intelligence of Harold's in|trigues and acce&s;&s;ion, had been moved to the highe&s;t pitch of indignation; but that he might give the better colour to his preten&s;ions, he &s;ent over an amba&s;&s;y to England, upbraiding that prince with his breach of faith, and &s;ummoning him to re&s;ign immediately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom. Harold replied to the Norman amba&s;&s;adors, that the oath with which he was reproached, had been extorted by
<PB N="130" REF="136">
the well grounded fear of violence, and could never, for that rea&s;on, be regarded as obligatory: That he had had no commi&s;&s;ion, either from the late King or the &s;tates of England, who alone could di&s;po&s;e of the crown, to make any tender of the &s;ucce&s;&s;on to the duke of Normandy; and if he, a private per&s;on, had a&s;|&s;umed &s;o much authority, and had even voluntarily &s;worn to &s;upport the duke's preten&s;ions, the oath was unlawful, and it was his duty to &s;eize the fir&s;t oppor|tunity of breaking it: That he had obtained the crown by the unanimous &s;uf|frages of the people; and &s;hould &s;how him&s;elf totally unworthy of their favour, did he not &s;trenuou&s;ly maintain tho&s;e national liberties, with which they had en|tru&s;ted him: And that the duke, if he made any attempt by force of arms, &s;hould experience the power of an united nation, conducted by a prince, who, &s;en&s;ible of the obligations, impo&s;ed on him by his royal dignity, was determined, that the &s;ame moment &s;hould put a period to his life and to his government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W.

<P>THIS an&s;wer was no other than William expected; and he had previou&s;ly fixed his re&s;olution of making an attempt upon England. Con&s;ulting only his courage, his re&s;entment, and his ambition, he overlooked all the difficul|ties, which mu&s;t attend an attack of a great kingdom by &s;uch inferior force, and he &s;aw only the circum&s;tances, which would facilitate his enterprize. He con&s;idered, that England, ever &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of Canute, had enjoyed a mo&s;t profound tranquillity, during a period of near fifty years; and it would require time for its &s;oldiers, enervated by long peace, to learn di&s;cipline, and its generals experience. He knew, that it was entirely unprovided of fortified towns, by which it could prolong the war; but mu&s;t venture its whole fortune in one de|ci&s;ive action again&s;t a veteran enemy, who, being once ma&s;ter of the field, would be in a condition to over-run the kingdom. He &s;aw that Harold, tho' he had given proofs of vigor and bravery, had newly mounted a throne, which he had acquired by faction, from which he had excluded a very antient royal family, and which was likely to totter under him by its own in&s;tability, much more if &s;haken by any violent external impul&s;e. And he hoped, that the very circum|&s;tance of his cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, quitting his own country, and leaving him&s;elf no hopes of retreat; as it would a&s;toni&s;h the enemy by the boldne&s;s of the enterprize, would in&s;pirit his &s;oldiers from de&s;pair, and rouze them to &s;u&s;tain the reputation of the Norman arms.</P>
<P>THE Normans, as they had long been di&s;tingui&s;hed by valour among all the European nations, had at this time attained to the highe&s;t pitch of military renown and glory. Be&s;ides acquiring by arms &s;uch a noble territory in France,
<PB N="131" REF="137">
be&s;ides defending it again&s;t continual attempts of the French monarch and all its neighbours, be&s;ides exerting many actions of vigor under their pre&s;ent &s;ove|reign; they had, about this very time, revived their antient fame, by the mo&s;t hazardous exploits, and the mo&s;t wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in the other extremity of Europe. A few Norman adventurers in Italy had acquired &s;uch an a&s;cendant, not only over the Italians and Greeks, but the Germans, and Saracens, that they expelled the&s;e foreigners, procured to them&s;elves ample e&s;tabli&s;hments, and laid the foundation of the opulent kingdom of Naples and Sicily<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 30.</NOTE>. The&s;e enterprizes of men, who were all of them va&s;&s;als in Normandy, many of them bani&s;hed for faction and rebellion, excited the ambition of the haughty William; who di&s;|dained, after &s;uch examples of fortune and valour, to be deterred from making an attack on a neighbouring country, where he could be &s;upported by the whole force of his principality.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation al&s;o of Europe in&s;pired William with hopes, that, be&s;ides his brave Normans, he might employ again&s;t England the flower of the military force, which was di&s;per&s;ed in all the other &s;tates. France, Germany, and the low countries, by the progre&s;s of the feudal in&s;titutions, were divided and &s;ub|divided into many &s;mall principalities and baronies; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, enjoying the civil juri&s;diction within them&s;elves, as well as the right of arms, acted, in many re&s;pects, as independant &s;overeigns, and maintained their properties and privileges, le&s;s by the authority of laws, than by their own force and valour. A military &s;pirit had univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed it&s;elf throughout Europe; and the &s;everal leaders, who&s;e minds were elevated by their princely &s;ituation, greedily embraced the mo&s;t adventurous enterprizes, and being accu&s;tomed to nothing from their infancy but recitals of the &s;ucce&s;s attending wars and battles, they were prompted by a natural ambition to imitate tho&s;e adventures, which they heard &s;o much celebrated, and which were &s;o much exaggerated by the credulity of the age. United, however loo&s;ely, by their duty to one &s;uperior lord, and by their connexions with the great body of the community, to which they belonged, they de&s;ired to &s;pread their fame each beyond his own di&s;trict; and, in all a&s;&s;em|blies, whether in&s;tituted for civil deliberations, for military expeditions, or merely for &s;how and entertainment, to out&s;hine each other by the reputation of &s;trength and prowe&s;s. Hence their genius for chivalry; hence their impatience of peace and tranquillity; and hence their readine&s;s to embark in any hazardous enterprize, however little intere&s;ted in its failure or &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, by his power, his courage, and his abilities, had long maintained a pre-eminence among tho&s;e haughty chieftains; and every one who de&s;ired to
<PB N="132" REF="138">
di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his addre&s;s in military exerci&s;es, or his valor in action, had been ambitions of acquiring a reputation in the court and in the armies of Normandy. Entertained with that ho&s;pitality and courte&s;y, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the age, they had formed attachments with the prince, and greedily attended to the pro&s;pects of glory and advantage, which he promi&s;ed them in return for their concurrence in an expedition again&s;t England. The more grandeur appeared in the attempt, the more it &s;uited their romantic &s;pirit: The fame of the intended inva&s;ion was already diffu&s;ed every where: Multitudes crowded to tender to the duke their &s;ervice, with that of their va&s;&s;als and retainers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictaven&s;is, p. 198.</NOTE>: And William found le&s;s difficulty in compleating his levies, than in choo&s;ing the mo&s;t veteran and experienced forces, and in rejecting the offers of tho&s;e, who were impatient to acquire fame under &s;o renowned a leader.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e advantages, which William owed to his per&s;onal valor and good conduct; he was beholden to fortune for procuring him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and for removing many ob&s;tacles, which it was natural for him to expect in an undertaking, where all his neighbours were &s;o deeply intere&s;ted. Conan, duke of Britanny, was his mortal enemy; and in order to throw a damp upon his enterprize, he cho&s;e this conjuncture for reviving his claim to Normandy it&s;elf; and he required, that, in ca&s;e of William's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t England, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dutchy might devolve to him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 33.</NOTE>. But Conan died &s;uddenly after making this demand; and Howel, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in&s;tead of adopting the malignity, or rather the prudence, of his predece&s;&s;or, zealou&s;ly &s;econded the duke's views, and &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on, Alain Fergant, to &s;erve under him with a force of five thou|&s;and Britons. The counts of Anjou, and of Flanders, encouraged their &s;ubjects to ergage in the expedition; and even the court of France, tho' it might ju&s;tly fear the aggrandizement of &s;o dangerous a va&s;&s;al, pur&s;ued not its intere&s;ts on this occa&s;ion with &s;ufficient vigor and re&s;olution. Philip I. the reigning French mo|narch, was a minor; and William, having communicated his project to the council, having de&s;ired a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and offered to do homage, in ca&s;e of his &s;uc|ce&s;s, for the crown of England, was indeed ordered to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of the enterprize; but the earl of Flanders, his father-in-law, being at the head of the regency, favoured under-hand his levies, and encouraged the enterprizing nobility to inli&s;t under the &s;tandard of the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, Henry IV. be&s;ides giving openly all his va&s;&s;als permi&s;&s;ion to embark in this expedition, which &s;o much engaged the attention of Europe, pro|mi&s;ed his protection to the dutchy of Normandy during the ab&s;ence of the prince,
<PB N="133" REF="139">
and thereby enabled him to draw his whole force to the attack of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 198.</NOTE>. But the mo&s;t important ally, whom William gained by his negotiations, was the pope, who had a mighty influence over the antient barons, no le&s;s devout in their religious principles than valorous in their military enterprizes. The Roman pontiff, after an in&s;en&s;ible progre&s;s during &s;everal ages of darkne&s;s and ignorance, began now to lift his head openly above all the princes of Europe; to a&s;&s;ume the office of a mediator, or even an arbitrator, in the quarrels of the greate&s;t monarchs; to interpo&s;e him&s;elf in all &s;ecular affairs; and to obtrude his dictates as &s;overeign laws on his ob&s;equious di&s;ciples. It was a &s;ufficient motive to Alexander II. the reign|ing pope, for embracing William's quarrel, that he alone had made an appeal to his tribunal, and rendered him umpire of the di&s;pute between him and Ha|rold; but there were other advantages, which, that pontiff fore&s;aw, mu&s;t re&s;ult from the conque&s;t of England by the Norman arms. That kingdom, tho' at fir&s;t converted by Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries, tho' it had afterwards advanced &s;ome far|ther &s;teps towards &s;ubjection under Rome, maintained &s;till a great independance in its eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;tration; and forming a world within it&s;elf, entirely &s;eparated from the re&s;t of Europe, it had hitherto proved inacce&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e exorbitant claims, which &s;upported the grandeur of the papacy. Alexander, therefore, hoped, that the French and Norman barons, if &s;ucce&s;sful in their enterprize, might import into that country a more devoted reverence to the holy &s;ee, and bring the Engli&s;h churches to a nearer conformity with tho&s;e of the re&s;t of Europe. He declared immediately in favour of William's claim<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Ingulf, p. 69. Higden, p. 285.

<P>THE government of the Germans, and that of all the northern nations who e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves on the ruins of Rome, was always extremely free; and tho&s;e fierce people, accu&s;tomed to independance and enured to arms, were more guided by per&s;ua&s;ion than authority, in the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which they paid their princes. The military de&s;poti&s;m, which had taken place in the Roman empire, and which, previou&s;ly to the irruption of the&s;e conquerors, had &s;unk the genius of men, and de&s;troyed every noble principle of &s;cience and virtue, was unable to re&s;i&s;t the vigorous efforts of a free people; and Europe, as from a new epoch, rekindled her antient &s;pirit, and &s;hook off the ba&s;e &s;ervitude to arbitrary will and authority, under which it had &s;o long laboured. The free con&s;titutions then e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, however impaired by the encroachments of &s;ucceeding princes, &s;till pre|&s;erve an air of independance and legal admini&s;tration, which di&s;tingui&s;h the Eu|ropean nations; and if that part of the globe maintain &s;entiments of liberty, ho|nour, equity, and valour, &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind, it owes the&s;e advan|tages chiefly to the &s;eeds implanted by tho&s;e generous barbarians.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Saxon government.</NOTE> THE Saxons, who &s;ubdued Britain, as they enjoyed great liberty in their own country, ob&s;tinately retained that invaluable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in their new &s;ettlement; and they imported into this i&s;land the &s;ame principles of independance, which they had inherited from their ance&s;tors. The chieftains (for &s;uch they were more properly than kings or princes) who commanded them in tho&s;e military expedi|tions, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very limited authority; and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than &s;ubdued, the antient inhabitants, they were indeed tran&s;planted into a new territory, but pre&s;erved unaltered all their civil and military in&s;titutions. The language was pure Saxon; even the names of places, which often remain while the tongue entirely changes, were almo&s;t all affixed by the new conque|rors; the manners and cu&s;toms were wholly German; and the &s;ame picture of a
<PB N="142" REF="148">
fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the ma&s;terly pencil of Tacitus, will apply to the&s;e founders of the Engli&s;h government. The King, &s;o far from being entitled to an arbitrary power, was only con&s;idered as the fir&s;t among the citizens; his authority depended more on his per&s;onal qualities than on his &s;tation; he was even &s;o far on a level with the other inhabitants, that a &s;tated price was affixed to his head, and a legal fine was levied from his murderer, which, tho' proportioned to his &s;tation, and &s;uperior to that paid for the life of a &s;ubject, was a &s;en&s;ible mark of his &s;ubordination to the community.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Succe&s;&s;ion of the Kings.</NOTE> IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that an independant people, &s;o little re&s;trained by laws, and cultivated by &s;cience, would not be very &s;trict in maintaining a regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of their princes. Tho' they paid a great re&s;pect to the royal family, and a&s;cribed to them an undi&s;puted &s;uperiority, they either had no rule, or none that was &s;teadily ob&s;erved, in filling the vacant throne; and pre&s;ent convenience in that emergency was more attended to than general principles. We are not how|ever to &s;uppo&s;e, that the crown was con&s;idered as altogether elective; and that a regular plan was traced by the con&s;titution for &s;upplying, by the &s;uffrages of the people, every vacancy made by the decea&s;e of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate. If any King on his death left a &s;on of an age and capacity fit for government, the young prince naturally &s;tepped into the throne: If he was a minor, his uncle, or the next prince of the blood, was promoted to the government, and left the &s;ceptre to his po&s;terity: Any &s;overeign, by taking previous mea&s;ures with the leading men, had it greatly in his power to appoint his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: All the&s;e changes, and indeed the ordinary admini&s;tration of government, required the expre&s;s concurrence, or at lea&s;t the tacit con&s;ent of the people; but pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, however obtained, went far towards procuring their obedience, and the idea of any right which was once excluded, was but feeble and imperfect. This is &s;o much the ca&s;e in all barbarous monarchies, and occurs &s;o often in the hi&s;tory of the Anglo Saxons, that we cannot con&s;i&s;tently entertain any other notion of their government. The idea of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in authority is &s;o natural to men, and is &s;o much fortified by the u&s;ual rule in tran&s;mitting private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that it mu&s;t retain a great influence on every &s;ociety, who do not exclude it by the refinements of a republican con&s;titution. But as there is a &s;en&s;ible difference between government and private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and every one is not equally qualified for the one as for the other, a people, who are not &s;en&s;ible of the general advantages attending a fixed rule, are apt to make great leaps in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and frequently to pa&s;s over the per&s;on, who, had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the requi&s;ite years and abilities, would have been thought entitled to the authority. Thus, the&s;e monarchies are not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, either elective or hereditary; and tho' the de&s;tination of a prince may
<PB N="143" REF="149">
often be followed in appointing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, they can as little be regarded as wholly te&s;tamentary. The &s;uffrages of the &s;tates may &s;ometimes e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ove|reign; but they more frequently recognize him whom they find e&s;tabli&s;hed: A few great men take the lead; the people, overawed and influenced, acquie&s;ce in the government; and the reigning prince, provided he be of the royal family, pa&s;&s;es undi&s;putably for the legal &s;overeign.</P>

It is probable al&s;o, that the con&s;titution might be &s;omewhat different in the different nations of the Heptarchy, and that it changed con&s;ide|rably during the cour&s;e of &s;ix centuries, which elap&s;ed from the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the Saxons till the Norman conque&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We know of one change, not incon&s;iderable in the Saxon con&s;titution. The Saxon annals, p. 49. inform us, that it is the prerogative of the King to name the dukes, earls, alderman and &s;heriffs of the counties. Affer, a contemporary writer, informs us, that Alfred depo&s;ed all the ignorant aldermen, and appointed men of more capacity in their place: Yet the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or &sect; 35. &s;ay ex|pre&s;sly, that the heretoghs or dukes, and the &s;heriffs, were cho&s;en by the freeholders in the folkmote, a county court, which was a&s;&s;embled once a year, and where all the freeholders &s;wore allegiance to the King.</NOTE>. But mo&s;t of the&s;e differences and changes, with their cau&s;es and effects, are unknown to us: It only appears, that, at all times, and in all the kingdoms, there was a national council, called a Wittenagemot or a&s;&s;embly of the wi&s;e men, (for that is the import of the term) who&s;e con&s;ent was requi&s;ite for the enacting laws, and for ratifying the chief acts of public ad|mini&s;tration. The preambles to all the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, Alfred, Edward the elder, Athel&s;tan, Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred, and Edward the Confe&s;&s;or; even tho&s;e to the laws of Canute, tho' a kind of conqueror, put this matter beyond controver&s;y, and carry proofs every where of a limited and legal government. But who were the con&s;tituent members of this Wittenagemot has not been de|termined with certainty by antiquarians. It is agreed, that the bi&s;hops and ab|bots <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sometimes abbe&s;&s;es were admitted; at lea&s;t, they often &s;ign the King's charters of grants. Spellm.

It al&s;o appears, that the aldermen or governors of counties, who,

There is only a clau&s;e of a law of King Athel&s;tan's, (&s;ee Spelm. Conc. p. 406) which has &s;tumbled &s;ome antiquarians, and has made them imagine that an earl was &s;uperior to an alderman. The weregild or the price of an earl's blood is there fixed at 15,000 thrim&s;as, equal to that of an archbi&s;hop; whereas that of a bi&s;hop and alderman is only 8000 thrim&s;as. To &s;olve this difficulty we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to Selden's conjecture, (&s;ee his Titles of Honour, chap. 5. p. 603, 604) that the term of earl was in the age of Athel&s;tan ju&s;t beginning to be of u&s;e in England, and &s;tood at that time for the atheling or prince of the blood, heir to the crown. This he confirms by a law of Canute, &sect; 55. where an atheling and an archbi&s;hop are put upon the &s;ame footing. In another law of the &s;ame Athel&s;tan the weregild of the prince or atheling is &s;aid to be 15,000 thrim&s;as. See Wilkins, p. 71.

The matter would probably be of difficult di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, even were it examined impart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ally; but as our parties have cho&s;en to divide on this head, the que&s;tion has been di&s;puted with the greater acrimony, and the ar|guments on both &s;ides have become, on that account, the more captious and de|ceitful. Our monarchical faction maintain, that the&s;e <HI>wites</HI> or <HI>&s;apientes</HI> were the judges or men learned in the law: The popular party a&s;&s;ert them to be repre|&s;entatives of the boroughs, or what we now call the commons.</P>

The commons are well known to have had no &s;hare in the governments e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Franks, Burgundians, and other northern nations; and we may conclude, that the Saxons, who remained longer barbarous and uncivilized than the&s;e tribes, would never think of conferring &s;uch an extraordinary privilege on trade and indu&s;try.

&s;trong proofs to convince us that they would admit any of a rank &s;o much inferior as the burge&s;&s;es, to &s;hare with them in the legi&s;lative authority. Tacitus indeed affirms, that, among the antient Germans, the con&s;ent of all the members of the community was required in every important deliberation; but he &s;peaks not of repre&s;entatives; and this antient practice, mentioned by the Roman hi&s;torians, could only have place in &s;mall tribes, where every citizen might without in|convenience be a&s;&s;embled upon any extraordinary emergency. After principa|lities became more exten&s;ive; after the differences of property had formed di&s;|tinctions more important than tho&s;e ari&s;ing from per&s;onal &s;trength and valor; we may conclude, that the national a&s;&s;emblies mu&s;t have been more limited in their number, and compo&s;ed only of the more con&s;iderable citizens.</P>
<P>BUT tho' we mu&s;t exclude the burge&s;&s;es or commons from the Saxon Wit|tinagemot; there is &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uppo&s;ing, that this a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ted of other members be&s;ide the prelates, abbots, aldermen, and the judges or privy council. For as all the&s;e, excepting &s;ome of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;ome rea&s;on to think, that the bi&s;hops were &s;ometimes cho&s;en by the Wittenagemot, and confirmed by the King.

We may, therefore, conclude, that the more con&s;iderable proprietors of land were, without any election, con&s;tituent mem|bers of the national a&s;&s;embly; and there is rea&s;on to think, that forty hides, or about four or five thou&s;and acres, was the e&s;tate requi&s;ite for intitling the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to this honourable privilege.

Nor need we imagine, that the public council would become di&s;orderly or confu&s;ed by admitting &s;o great a multitude. The landed property of England was pro|bably in few hands during the Saxon times; at lea&s;t, during the latter part of that period: And as men had &s;mall ambition of attending the&s;e public councils, there was no danger of the a&s;&s;embly's becoming too numerous for the di&s;patch of the little bu&s;ine&s;s, which was brought before them.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152">
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> IT is certain, that, whatever we may determine concerning the con&s;tituent members of the Wittenagemot, in whom the legi&s;lature re&s;ided, the Anglo-Saxon government, in the period preceding the Norman conque&s;t, was become ex|tremely ari&s;tocratical: The royal authority was very limited; the people, even if admitted to that a&s;&s;embly, were of little or no weight or con&s;ideration. We have hints given us in the hi&s;torians of the great power and riches of particular noblemen: And it could not but happen, after the abolition of the Heptarchy, when the King lived at a di&s;tance from the provinces, that the&s;e great proprietors, who re&s;ided on their e&s;tates, would much augment their authority over their va&s;&s;als and retainers, and over all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Hence the immea&s;urable power a&s;&s;umed by Harold, Godwin, Leofric, Siward, Morcar, Edwin, Edric and Alfric, who controlled the authority of the kings, and rendered them&s;elves quite nece&s;&s;ary in the government. The two latter, tho' dete&s;ted by the people, on account of their joining a foreign enemy, &s;till pre|&s;erved their power and influence; and we may therefore conclude, that their authority was founded, not on popularity, but on family rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. There is one Athe&s;tan, mentioned in the reign of the king of that name, who is called alderman of all England, and is &s;aid to be half-king; tho' the monarch him&s;elf was a prince of great valour and ability<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t Rame&s; &sect; 3. p. 387.</NOTE>.

<P>THE circum&s;tances, attending the inva&s;ions of the Danes, would al&s;o &s;erve much to increa&s;e the power of the principal nobility. The&s;e freebooters made unexpected inroads on all quarters; and there was a nece&s;&s;ity, that each county &s;hould re&s;i&s;t them by its own force, and under the conduct of its own magi&s;trates, and nobility. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, that a general war, managed by the united efforts of the whole &s;tate, commonly increa&s;es the power of the crown; the&s;e private wars and inroads turned to the advantage of the aldermen and nobles.</P>

The&s;e di&s;orders would be increa&s;ed by the exorbitant power of the ari&s;tocracy; and would, in their

Men, not daring to rely on the guardian&s;hip of the laws, were obliged to devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of &s;ome chieftain, who&s;e orders they followed even to the di&s;turbance of the government or the injury of their fellow-citizens, and who afforded them in return protection from any in&s;ult or inju&s;tice by &s;trangers.

Dr. Hickes has pre&s;erved a very curious Saxon bond of this kind, which he calls a <HI>Sodalitium,</HI> and which contains many parti|culars, characteri&s;tical of the manners and cu&s;toms of the times<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert.

When any of the a&s;&s;ociates is in danger, and calls for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fellows, they promi&s;e, be&s;ides flying to his &s;uccour, to give information to the &s;heriff; and if he be negligent in protecting the per&s;on expo&s;ed to hazard, they engage to levy a fine of one pound from him: If the pre&s;ident of the &s;ociety him&s;elf be wanting in this particular, he binds him&s;elf to pay one pound; unle&s;s he has the rea&s;onable excu&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, or of duty to his &s;uperior.

There are other regulations to protect them|&s;elves and their &s;ervants from all injuries, to revenge &s;uch as are committed, and to prevent their giving abu&s;ive language to each other, and the fine, which they engage to pay for that offence, is a mea&s;ure of honey.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but a confederacy of this kind mu&s;t have been a great &s;ource of friend&s;hip and attachment, when men lived in perpetual danger from ene|mies, robbers, and oppre&s;&s;ors, and received protection chiefly from their per&s;onal valor, and from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their friends or patrons. As animo&s;ities were then more violent, connexions were al&s;o more intimate, whether voluntary or derived from blood: The mo&s;t remote degree of propinquity was regarded: An inde|lible memory of benefits was pre&s;erved: Severe vengeance was taken of injuries, both from a point of honour, and as the be&s;t means of future &s;ecurity: And the civil union being weak, many private confederacies were entered into to &s;upply its place, and to procure men that &s;afety, which the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to in&s;ure them.</P>
<P>ON the whole, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming liberty or rather licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Anglo-Saxons, the great body of the people, in the&s;e ages, really enjoyed much le&s;s true liberty, than where the execution of the laws is the mo&s;t &s;evere, and where &s;ubjects are reduced to the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ubordination and dependance on the civil magi&s;trate. The rea&s;on is derived from the exce&s;s it&s;elf of that liberty.

The former was always much regarded by all the German nations even in their mo&s;t barbarous &s;tate; and as the Saxon nobility had few expen&s;ive plea&s;ures to di&s;&s;ipate their fortune, and the commons little trade or indu&s;try by which they could accumulate riches, the&s;e two ranks of men, even tho' they were not &s;eparated by po&s;itive laws, might remain long di&s;tinct, and the noble families continue many ages in opulence and &s;plendor.

If by any extraordinary accident, a mean per&s;on acquired riches, a circum&s;tance &s;o &s;ingular made him be known and remarked; he became the object of envy, as well as indignation, to all the nobles; he would have great difficulty to defend what he had acquired; and he would find it impo&s;&s;ible to protect him&s;elf from oppre&s;&s;ion, except by courting the patronage of &s;ome great chieftain, and paying a large price for his &s;afety.</P>
<P>There are two &s;tatutes among the Saxon laws, which &s;eem calculated to con|found the&s;e different ranks of men; that of Athel&s;tan, by which a merchant, who had made three long &s;ea voyages on his own account, was intitled to the quality of thane<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 71.</NOTE>; and that of the &s;ame prince, by which a ceorle or hu&s;bandman, who had been able to purcha&s;e five hides of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen, a hall and bell, was rai&s;ed to the &s;ame di&s;tinction<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Selden Titles of Honour, p. 515.

We may thence infer, that the arts in general were much le&s;s ad|vanced in England than in France; a greater number of idle &s;ervants and retainers lived about the great families; and as the&s;e, even in France, were powerful enough to di&s;turb the execution of the laws, we may judge of the authority, acquired by the ari&s;tocracy in England. When earl Godwin be&s;ieged the Con|fe&s;&s;or in London, he &s;ummoned together from all parts his hu&s;carles, or hou&s;e|coerles and retainers, and obliged his &s;overeign to accept of the conditions, which he was plea&s;ed to impo&s;e upon him.</P>
<P>THE lower rank of free-men were denominated coerles among the Anglo-Saxons; and where they were indu&s;trious, they were chiefly employed in hu&s;|bandry: Whence a coerle, and a hu&s;bandman, became in a manner &s;ynonimous terms. They cultivated the farms of the nobility or thanes, for which they paid rent; and they &s;eem to have been removeable at plea&s;ure. For there is no men|tion of lea&s;es among the Anglo-Saxons: The pride of the nobility, together with the general ignorance of writing, mu&s;t have rendered the&s;e contracts very rare, and mu&s;t have kept the hu&s;bandmen in a very dependant condition. The rents of farms were then chiefly paid in kind<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae. &sect; 70.

<P>But the mo&s;t numerous rank by far in the community &s;eems to have been the &s;laves or villains, who were the property of their lords, and were con&s;equently incapable, them&s;elves, of all property.

This was not the ca&s;e with the German nations, as far as we can collect from the account given us by Tacitus. The perpetual wars in the

<P>AS the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and writings very rare, the County or Hundred court was the place where the mo&s;t remarkable civil tran&s;ac|tions were fini&s;hed, in order to pre&s;erve a memorial of them, and prevent all fu|ture di&s;putes.

<P>AMONG a people, who lived in &s;o &s;imple a manner as the Anglo-Saxons, the judicial power is always of greater importance than the legi&s;lative. There were few or no taxes impo&s;ed by the &s;tates: There were few &s;tatutes enacted; and the nation was le&s;s governed by laws, than by cu&s;toms, which admitted a great la|titude of interpretation. Tho' it &s;hould, therefore, be allowed, that the Wit|tenagemot was altogether compo&s;ed of the principal nobility, the county-courts, where all the freeholders were admitted, and which regulated all the daily occur|rences of life, formed a very wide ba&s;is for the government, and were no con|temptible check on the ari&s;tocracy. But there is another power &s;till more im|portant than either the judicial or legi&s;lative; and that is the power of injuring or &s;erving by immediate force and violence, for which it is difficult to obtain redre&s;s in courts of ju&s;tice. In all exten&s;ive governments, where the execution of the laws is feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of the principal nobility;
<PB N="153" REF="159">
and the degree of it which prevails, cannot be determined &s;o much by the public &s;tatutes, as by &s;mall &s;trokes of hi&s;tory, by particular cu&s;toms, and &s;ometimes by the rea&s;on and nature of things. The highlands of Scotland have been long en|titled by law to every privilege of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; but it was not till very lately that the common people could in fact enjoy the&s;e privileges.</P>
<P>THE powers of all the members of the Anglo-Saxon government are di&s;puted among hi&s;torians and antiquarians; and the extreme ob&s;curity of the &s;ubject, even tho' faction had never entered into the que&s;tion, would naturally have begot tho&s;e controver&s;ies. But the great influence of the lords over their &s;laves and tenants, the client&s;hip of the burghers, the total want of a middling rank of men, the total want al&s;o of lawyers who did not then form a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion, the extent of the monarchy, the loo&s;e execution of the laws, the continued di&s;orders and con|vul&s;ions of the &s;tate; all the&s;e circum&s;tances evince, that the Anglo-Saxon go|vernment became at la&s;t extremely ari&s;tocratical; and the events, during the pe|riod immediately preceding the conque&s;t, confirm this inference or conjecture.</P>
<P>BOTH the puni&s;hments inflicted on crimes by the Anglo-Saxon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|cature, and the methods of proof employed in all cau&s;es, appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|gular, and are very different from tho&s;e which prevail at pre&s;ent among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|lized nations.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t conceive, that the antient Germans were very li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">le removed from the original &s;tate of nature: The &s;ocial confederacy among them was more mar|tial than civil: They had chiefly in view the means of attack or defence again&s;t public enemies, not tho&s;e of protection again&s;t their fellow citizens: Their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions were &s;o &s;lender and &s;o equal, that they were not expo&s;ed to great danger; and the natural bravery of the people made every man tru&s;t to him&s;elf and to his particular friends for his defence or vengeance. This defect in the political union drew much clo&s;er the knot of particular con&s;ederacies: An in&s;ult upon any man was regarded by all his relations and a&s;&s;ociates as a common injury: They were bound, by honour as well as by a &s;en&s;e of general intere&s;t, to revenge his death, or any violence which he had &s;uffered: They retaliated on the aggre&s;&s;or by like violences; and if he was protected, as was natural and u&s;ual, by his own clan, the quarrel was &s;pread &s;till wider, and bred endle&s;s di&s;orders in the nation.</P>
<P>The Fri&s;ians, a tribe of the Germans, had never advanced beyond this wild and imperfect &s;tate of &s;ociety; and the right of private revenge &s;till remained among them unlimited and uncontrouled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LL. Fri&s;. tit. 2. apud Lindenbrog. p. 491.</NOTE>. But the other German nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one &s;tep farther towards completing the political or
<PB N="154" REF="160">
civil union. Tho' it &s;till continued to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible point of honour for every clan to revenge the death or injury of their fellow, the magi&s;trate had ac|quired a right of interpo&s;ing in the quarrel, and of accommodating the difference. He obliged the per&s;on maimed or injured, and the relations of one killed, to ac|cept of a pre&s;ent from the aggre&s;&s;or and his relations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LL. Aethelb. &sect; 23. LL. Aelf. &sect; 27.</NOTE>, as a compen&s;ation for the injury<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Called by the Saxons <HI>maegbota.</HI></NOTE>, and to drop all farther pro&s;ecution of revenge. That the accom|modation of one quarrel might not be the &s;ource of more, this pre&s;ent was fixed and certain, according to the rank of the per&s;on killed or injured, and was com|monly paid in cattle, the chief property of tho&s;e rude and uncultivated nations. A pre&s;ent of this kind gratified the revenge of the injured clan by the lo&s;s which the aggre&s;&s;or &s;uffered: It &s;atisfied their pride by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which it expre&s;|&s;ed: It dimini&s;hed their regret for the lo&s;s or injury of a kin&s;man by their acqui&s;i|tion of new property: And thus general peace was for a moment re&s;tored to the &s;ociety<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de mor.

<P>BUT when the German nations had been &s;ettled &s;ome time in the provinces of the Roman empire, they made &s;till a new &s;tep towards a more cultivated life, and their criminal ju&s;tice gradually improved and refined it&s;elf. The magi&s;trate, who&s;e office it was to guard public peace and to &s;uppre&s;s private animo&s;ities, con|ceived him&s;elf to be injured by every injury done to any of his people; and be|&s;ides the compen&s;ation to the per&s;on who &s;uffered, or to his clan, he thought him&s;elf entitled to exact a fine, called the Fridwit, as an atonement for the breach of peace, and as a reward for the pains which he had taken in accommo|dating the quarrel. When this idea, which is &s;o natural, was once &s;ugge&s;ted, it was readily received both by magi&s;trate and people. The numerous fines which were levied, augmented the profits of the King: And the people were &s;en|&s;ible, that he would be more vigilant in interpo&s;ing with his good offices, when he reaped &s;uch immediate advantage by them; and that injuries would be le&s;s frequent, when, be&s;ides compen&s;ation to the per&s;on injured, they were expo&s;ed to this additional penalty<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides paying money to the relations of the decea&s;ed and to the King, the murderer was al&s;o obliged to pay the ma&s;ter of a &s;lave or va&s;&s;al a &s;um as a compen&s;ation for his lo&s;s.

Whatever we may imagine concerning the u&s;ual truth and &s;incerity of men, who live in a rude and barbarous &s;tate, there is much more fal&s;ehood, and even perjury, among them than among civilized nations; and virtue, which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cultivated rea&s;on, never flouri&s;hes to any degree, nor is founded on &s;teady principles of honour, except where a good edu|cation becomes general; and men are taught the pernicious con&s;equences of vice, treachery, and immorality.

<P>ON the whole, there are three things to be con&s;idered, wherever a &s;um of mo|ney is mentioned in antient times. Fir&s;t, the change of denomination, by which a pound has been reduced to the third part of its antient weight in &s;ilver. Se|condly, the change in value by the greater plenty of money, which has reduced the &s;ame weight of &s;ilver to ten times le&s;s value, compared to commodities; and con&s;equently, a pound &s;terling to the thirtieth part of the antient value. Thirdly, the fewer people and le&s;s indu&s;try, which were then to be found in every European kingdom. This circum&s;tance made even the thirtieth part of the &s;um more dif|ficult to levy, and cau&s;ed any &s;um to have more than thirty times more weight and influence both abroad and at home, than in our times; in the &s;ame manner that a &s;um, an hundred thou&s;and pounds for in&s;tance, is at pre&s;ent more difficult to levy in a &s;mall &s;tate, &s;uch as Bavaria, and can operate greater effects on &s;uch a &s;mall community, than on England. This la&s;t difference is not ea&s;y to be calculated: But allowing, that England has now above five times more indu&s;try, and three times more people than it had at the conque&s;t and for &s;ome reigns after it, we are, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, to conceive, taking all circum&s;tances to|gether, every &s;um of money mentioned by hi&s;torians, as if it were multiplied more than an hundred-fold above a &s;um of the &s;ame denomination at pre&s;ent.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1066" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;equences of the battle of Ha&s;tings.</NOTE> NOTHING could exceed the con&s;ternation, which &s;eized the Engli&s;h, when they received intelligence of the unfortunate battle of Ha&s;tings, the death of their King, the &s;laughter of their principal nobility, and of their brave&s;t warriors, and the rout and di&s;per&s;ion of the remainder. But tho' the lo&s;s, which they had &s;u&s;tained in that fatal action, was con&s;iderable, it might ea&s;ily have been repaired by a great nation; where the people were generally armed, and where there re&s;ided &s;o many powerful noblemen in every province, who could have a&s;|&s;embled their retainers, and have obliged the duke of Normandy to divide his army, and probably to wa&s;te it in a multitude of actions and rencounters. It was thus, that the kingdom had formerly re&s;i&s;ted, for many years, its invaders, and had been gradually &s;ubdued, by the continued efforts of the Romans, Saxons, and Danes; and equal difficulties might have been apprehended by William in this bold and hazardous enterprize. But there were &s;everal vices in the Anglo-Saxon con&s;titution which rendered it difficult for the Engli&s;h to defend their li|berties in &s;o critical an emergency. The people had in a good mea&s;ure lo&s;t all national pride and &s;pirit, by their recent and long &s;ubjection to the Danes; and as Canute had, in the cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration, much abated the rigors of conque&s;t, and had governed them equitably by their own laws, they regarded with the le&s;s terror the ignominy of a foreign yoke, and deemed the inconveniences of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion le&s;s formidable than tho&s;e of blood&s;hed, war, and re&s;i&s;tance. Their attachment al&s;o to the antient royal family had been much weakened by their
<PB N="165" REF="171">
habitude of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Dani&s;h princes, and by their late election of Harold, or their acquie&s;cence in his u&s;urpation. And as they had long been accu&s;tomed to regard Edgar Atheling, the only heir of the Saxon line, as unfit to govern them even in times of order and tranquillity; they could entertain &s;mall hopes of his being able to repair &s;uch great lo&s;&s;es as they had &s;u&s;tained, or to re&s;i&s;t the victorious arms of the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>THAT they might not, however, be altogether wanting to them&s;elves in this extreme nece&s;&s;ity, the Engli&s;h took &s;ome &s;teps towards adju&s;ting their disjointed government, and uniting them&s;elves again&s;t the common enemy. The two po|tent earls, Edwin and Morcar, who had fled to London with the remains of the broken army, took the lead on this occa&s;ion; and in concert with Stigand, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great authority, and of ample revenues, proclaimed Edgar King, and endeavoured to put the people in a po&s;ture of de|fence, and encourage them to re&s;i&s;t the Normans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Order Vitalis, p. 502. Hoveden. p. 449. Knyghton, p. 2343.</NOTE>. But the terror of the late defeat, and the near neighbourhood of the invaders, increa&s;ed the confu&s;ion, in|&s;eparable from great revolutions; and every re&s;olution propo&s;ed was ha&s;ty, fluc|tuating, variable; di&s;concerted by fear or faction; ill planned, and wor&s;e exe|cuted.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, that his enemies might not have leizure to recover their con&s;ter|nation or unite their councils, immediately put him&s;elf in motion after his vic|tory, and re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute an enterprize, which nothing but celerity and vigor could render finally &s;ucce&s;sful. His fir&s;t attempt was again&s;t Romney, who&s;e inhabitants he &s;everely puni&s;hed on account of their cruel treatment of &s;ome Norman &s;eamen and &s;oldiers, who had been carried thither by &s;tre&s;s of weather or by a mi&s;take in their cour&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gul Pictav. p. 204.</NOTE>: And fore&s;eeing that his conque&s;t of England might &s;till be attended with many difficulties and with much oppo&s;ition, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, before he &s;hould advance farther into the country, to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Dover, which would both &s;ecure him a retreat in ca&s;e of adver&s;e fortune, and afford him a &s;afe landing-place for &s;uch &s;upplies as might be requi&s;ite for a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to pu&s;h his advantages. The terror, dif|fu&s;ed by his victory at Ha&s;tings, was &s;o great, that the garri&s;on of Dover, tho' numerous and well provided of every thing, immediately capitulated; and as the Normans, ru&s;hing in to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, ha&s;tily &s;et fire to &s;ome of the hou&s;es, William, who was de&s;irous to conciliate the minds of the Engli&s;h by an appearance of lenity and ju&s;tice, made reparation to the inhabitants for their lo&s;&s;es<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

THE Norman army, being much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a dy&s;entery, was obliged to remain here for eight days; and the duke, on their recovery, advanced with quick marches towards London, and by his approach increa&s;ed the confu&s;ions, which were already &s;o prevalent in the Engli&s;h councils. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics in par|ticular, who&s;e influence was great over the people, began to declare in his favour; and as mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops and dignified clergymen were even then French or Norman, the pope's bull, by which his enterprize was avowed and con&s;ecrated, was now openly in&s;i&s;ted on as a rea&s;on for general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.

<P>IT is evident, that the chief rea&s;on of this alteration in the &s;entiments of the Engli&s;h, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the departure of William, who was alone capable of curbing the violence of his captains, and of overawing the mutinies of the people. Nothing indeed appears more &s;trange, than that this prince, in le&s;s than three months after the conque&s;t of a great, warlike, and turbulent nation, &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf, in order to revi&s;it his own country, which remained in pro|found tranquillity, and was not menaced by any of its neighbours; and &s;hould leave &s;o long his jealous &s;ubjects at the mercy of an in&s;olent and licentious army. Were we not a&s;&s;ured of the &s;olidity of his genius, and the good &s;en&s;e di&s;played in all other circum&s;tances of his conduct, we might a&s;cribe this mea&s;ure to a vain o&s;tentation, which rendered him impatient to di&s;play his pomp and magnificence among his antient courtiers. It is therefore more natural to believe, that in &s;o extraordinary a &s;tep, he was guided by a concealed policy; and that tho' he had thought proper at fir&s;t to allure the people to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by the &s;emblance of a legal admini&s;tration, he found, that he could neither &s;atisfy his rapacious captains nor &s;ecure his un&s;table government, without exerting farther the rights of con|que&s;t, and &s;eizing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Engli&s;h. In order to give a pretence for this violence, he endeavoured, without di&s;covering his intention, to provoke and allure them into in&s;urrections, which, he thought, could never prove dangerous, while he detained all the principal nobility in Normandy, while a great and vic|torious army was quartered in England, and while he him&s;elf was &s;o near to &s;uppre&s;s any tumult or rebellion. But as no antient writer has a&s;cribed this tyrannical purpo&s;e to William, it &s;carce &s;eems allowable, from conjecture alone, to throw &s;uch an imputation upon him.</P>

<P>BUT as the great body of the clergy were &s;till natives, the King had much rea&s;on to dread the effects of their re&s;entment; and he therefore u&s;ed the precaution of ex|pelling the Engli&s;h from all the con&s;iderable dignities, and of advancing foreigners in their place.

The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the late rebellions, and the total &s;ubjec|tion of the Engli&s;h, made him hope, that this attempt, however violent, would be covered by his great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and be overlooked amid&s;t the other important revolutions, which affected &s;o deeply the property and liberty of the kingdom. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e mighty advantages, he did not think it &s;afe to vio|late the reverence u&s;ually paid the primate, but under cover of a new &s;uper&s;ti|tion, which he was the great in&s;trument of introducing into England.</P>

Pope Alexander, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted William in his conque&s;t of England, rea&s;onably ex|pected, that the French and Normans would import into England the &s;ame re|verence for his &s;acred character, with which they were imbued in their own coun|try;

As &s;oon, therefore, as the Norman prince &s;eem|ed fully e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, the Pope di&s;patched Ermenfroy, bi&s;hop of Sion, as his legate into England; and this prelate was the fir&s;t, who had ever appeared with that character in any part of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. The King, tho' he was probably led by principle to pay this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Rome, determined, as is u&s;ual, to employ the incident as a means of &s;erving his political purpo&s;es, and of degrading tho&s;e Engli&s;h prelates, who were become obnoxious to him. The legate &s;ubmitted to become the in&s;trument of his tyranny; and naturally thought, that the more violent the exertion of power, the more certainly did it confirm the authority of that court from which he derived his commi&s;&s;ion.

Gregory wrote him a letter, re|quiring him to fulfil his promi&s;e in doing homage for the kingdom of England to the &s;ee of Rome, and to &s;end him over that tribute, which all his predece&s;&s;ors had been accu&s;tomed to pay to the vicar of Chri&s;t. By the tribute, he meant Peter's pence; which, tho' at fir&s;t a charitable donation of the Saxon princes, was interpreted, according to the u&s;ual practice of the Romi&s;h court, to be a badge of &s;ubjection acknowledged by the kingdom. William replied, that the money &s;hould be remitted as u&s;ual; but that he neither had promi&s;ed to do ho|mage to Rome, nor was it in the lea&s;t his purpo&s;e to impo&s;e that &s;ervitude on his &s;tate<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Spileg. Seldeni ad Eadmer, p. 164.</NOTE>. And the better to &s;how Gregory his independance, he refu&s;ed, notwith|&s;tanding the frequent complaints of the Pope, the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops liberty to at|tend a general council, which that pontiff had &s;ummoned again&s;t his enemies.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the King &s;howed this vigor in &s;upporting the royal dignity, he was infected with the general &s;uper&s;tition of the age, and he did not di&s;cover the am|bitious &s;cope of tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which, under the cover of &s;trictne&s;s in religion,
<PB N="193" REF="199">
were introduced or prompted by the Roman pontiff, Gregory, while he was throwing all Europe into combu&s;tion by his violence and impo&s;tures, affected an anxious care for the purity of manners; and even the cha&s;te plea&s;ures of the marriage-bed were incon&s;i&s;tent, in his opinion, with the &s;anctity of the &s;acerdotal character. He had i&s;&s;ued a decree prohibiting the marriage of prie&s;ts, excom|municating all clergymen who retained their wives, declaring all &s;uch unlawful commerce to be fornication, and rendering it criminal in the laity to attend di|vine wor&s;hip when &s;uch profane prie&s;ts officiated at the altar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 455. 457. Flor. Wigorn, p. 638. Spell. Concil. fol. 13. A. D. 1076.</NOTE>. This point was a great object in the politics of the Romi&s;h court; and it co&s;t them infinitely more pains to e&s;tabli&s;h it, than the propagation of any &s;peculative ab&s;urdity, which they had ever attempted to introduce. Many &s;ynods were &s;ummoned in different parts of Europe, before it was finally &s;ettled; and it was there con|&s;tantly remarked, that the younger clergymen complied chearfully with the Pope's decrees in this particular, and that the chief reluctance appeared in tho&s;e who were more advanced in years: An event &s;o little conformable to men's fir&s;t expectations, that it could not fail to be glo&s;&s;ed on, even in that blind and &s;uper&s;titious age. Wil|liam allowed the Pope's legate to a&s;&s;emble, in his ab&s;ence, a &s;ynod at Winche&s;ter, in order to &s;ettle the celibacy of the clergy; but the church of England could not yet be carried the whole length expected; and the &s;ynod was content with decree|ing, that the bi&s;hops &s;hould not thenceforth ordain any prie&s;ts or deacons without exacting from them a promi&s;e of celibacy; but that none, except tho&s;e who be|longed to collegiate or cathedral churches, &s;hould be obliged to &s;eparate from their wives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of prince Robert.</NOTE> THE King pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in Normandy; but his long re&s;idence there was not entirely owing to his declared preference of that dutchy: His pre&s;ence was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary for compo&s;ing tho&s;e di&s;turbances, which had ari&s;en in that favourite territory, and which had even originally proceeded from his own family. Robert, his elde&s;t &s;on, &s;irnamed Gambaron or Courtho&s;e, from his &s;hort legs, was a prince, who inherited all the bravery of his family and nation; but without that policy and di&s;&s;imulation, by which his father was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed; and which, no le&s;s than his military valor, had contributed to his great &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Greedy of fame, impatient of contradiction, without re&s;erve in his friend&s;hips, declared in his enmities, this prince could endure no controul even from his im|perious father, and openly a&s;pired to that independance, to which his temper, as well as &s;ome circum&s;tances in his &s;ituation, &s;trongly invited him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Order Vital. p. 545.

<PB N="194" REF="200">
inhabitants that Robert &s;hould be their prince; and before he undertook the ex|pedition again&s;t England, he had, on the application of the French court, declared him his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in Normandy, and had obliged the barons of that dutchy to do him homage as their future &s;overeign. By this artifice, he had endeavoured to appea&s;e the jealou&s;y of his neighbours, as affording them a pro&s;pect of &s;eparating England from his dominions on the continent; but when Robert demanded of him the execution of the&s;e engagements, he gave him an ab&s;olute refu&s;al, and told him, according to the homely &s;aying, that he never intended to throw off his cloaths, till he went to bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Malr. p. 160.</NOTE>. Robert openly declared his di&s;content; and was &s;u&s;|pected of &s;ecretly in&s;tigating the King of France and the earl of Brittanny to the oppo&s;ition which they made to William, and which had formerly fru&s;trated his attempts upon the town of Dol. And as the quarrel &s;till augmented, Robert proceeded to entertain a &s;trong jealou&s;y of his two &s;urviving brothers, William and Henry (for Richard was killed in hunting by a &s;tag) who, by greater &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and complai&s;ance, had acquired the affections of their father. In this di&s;po&s;ition, the greate&s;t trifle &s;ufficed to produce a rupture between them.</P>
<P>THE three princes, re&s;iding with their father in the ca&s;tle of l'Aigle in Nor|mandy, were one day engaged in &s;port together; and after much frolic, the two younger took it in their head to throw over &s;ome water on Robert as he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the court on leaving their apartment<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Order Vital. p. 545.</NOTE>; a pa&s;time, which he would natu|rally have regarded as innocent, had it not been for the &s;ugge&s;tions of Alberic de Grentme&s;nil, &s;on of that Hugh de Grentme&s;nil, whom William had formerly deprived of his fortunes, when that baron de&s;erted him during his greate&s;t diffi|culties in England. This young nobleman, mindful of the injury, per&s;uaded the prince, that this action was meant as a public affront, which it behoved him in honour to re&s;ent; and the choleric Robert, drawing his &s;word, ran up &s;tairs, with an intention of taking revenge on his brothers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The whole ca&s;tle was full of tumult, which the King him&s;elf, who ha&s;tened from his apartment, found &s;ome difficulty to appea&s;e. But he could by no means appea&s;e the re&s;entment of his elde&s;t &s;on, who, complaining of his partiality, and fancying that no proper atonement had been made him for the infult, left the court that very evening, and ha&s;tened to Ro&uuml;en, with an intention of &s;eizing the citadel of that place<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But being di&s;appointed in this view by the precaution and vigilance of Roger de Ivery, the governor, he fled to Hugh de Neufchatel, a powerful Norman ba|ron, who gave him protection in his ca&s;tles; and he openly levied war again&s;t his father<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Order Vital. p. 545.

engaged all the young nobility of Normandy and Maine, as well of Anjou and Brittanny, to take part with him; and it was &s;u&s;pected, that Matilda, his mo|ther, who&s;e favourite he was, &s;upported him in his rebellion by &s;ecret remittances of money, and by the encouragement, which &s;he gave his partizans.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1079" UNIT="year"> ALL the hereditary provinces of William, as well as his family, were during &s;everal years thrown into convul&s;ion by this war; and he was at la&s;t obliged to have recour&s;e to England, where that &s;pecies of military government, which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed, gave him greater authority than the antient feudal in&s;titutions permitted him to exerci&s;e in Normandy. He called over an army of Engli&s;h under his antient captains, who &s;oon expelled Robert and his adherents from their retreats, and re&s;tored the &s;overeign's authority in all his dominions. The young prince was obliged to take &s;helter in the ca&s;tle of Gerberoy in the Beauvoi&s;is, which the King of France, who &s;ecretly fomented all the&s;e di&s;cords, had pro|vided for him. In this fortre&s;s he was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by his father, again&s;t whom, having a &s;trong garri&s;on, he made a gallant defence. There pa&s;t under the walls of this place many rencounters, which re&s;embled more the &s;ingle combats of chi|valry, than the military actions of armies; but one of them was remarkable for its circum&s;tances and its event. Robert happened to encounter with the King, who was concealed by his helmet; and both being valiant, a fierce combat en|&s;ued, till at la&s;t the young prince wounded his father in the arm, and threw him from his hor&s;e. Calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his voice di&s;covered him to his &s;on; who &s;truck with remor&s;e for his pa&s;t crime, and a&s;toni&s;hed with the apprehen&s;ions of one much greater, which he had &s;o nearly incurred, in&s;tantly threw him&s;elf at his father's feet, craved pardon for his offences, and offered to purcha&s;e forgive|ne&s;s by any atonement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 106.

The re&s;entment, harboured by William, was &s;o inve|terate, that he did not immediately corre&s;pond to this dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his &s;on with like tenderne&s;s; but giving him his malediction, departed for his own camp, on Robert's hor&s;e, which that prince had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to mount<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">H.

He &s;oon after rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and marched with his army to Normandy; where the interpo&s;ition of the Queen and other common friends brought about a recon|cilement, which was probably not a little forwarded by the genero&s;ity of the &s;on's behaviour in this action, and by the returning &s;en&s;e of his pa&s;t mi&s;conduct. The King &s;eemed &s;o fully appea&s;ed, that he even carried over Robert with him into England; where he intru&s;ted him to repel an inroad of Malcolm King of

<P>THE King was naturally a great oeconomi&s;t; and tho' no prince had ever been &s;o bountiful to his officers and &s;ervants, it was merely becau&s;e he had ren|dered him&s;elf univer&s;al proprietor of England, and had a whole kingdom to be|&s;tow. He re&s;erved a very ample revenue for the crown; and in the general di&s;|tribution of land among his followers, he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no le&s;s than 1422 manors in different parts of England<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">We&s;t's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 24.</NOTE>, which paid him rent either in money, or in corn, cattle, and the u&s;ual produce of the land.

<P>SOME writers have been de&s;irous of refu&s;ing to this prince the title of Con|queror, in the &s;en&s;e in which it is commonly under&s;tood; and under pretence, that that word is &s;ometimes in old books applied to &s;uch as make an acqui&s;ition of territory by any means, they are willing to reject William's title, by right of war, to the crown of England.

or have been attended with &s;o &s;udden an alteration both of power and pro|perty. The Roman &s;tate, which &s;pread its dominion over Europe, left the rights of individuals, in a great mea&s;ure, untouched; and tho&s;e civilized conquerors, while they made their own country the &s;eat of empire, found, that they could draw mo&s;t advantage from the &s;ubject provinces, by be&s;towing on the natives the free enjoyment of their own laws and of their private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The barba|rians, who &s;ubdued the Roman empire, tho' they &s;ettled in the conquered coun|tries, yet being accu&s;tomed to a rude uncultivated life, found a &s;mall part of the land &s;ufficient to &s;upply all their wants; and they were not tempted to &s;eize ex|ten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which they neither knew how to cultivate nor employ.

After Mahomet had, by means of his pretended revelations, united the di&s;per&s;ed Arabians under one head, they i&s;&s;ued forth from their de&s;arts in great multitudes; and being animated with zeal for their new religion, and &s;upported by the vigor of their new government, they made deep impre&s;&s;ions on the ea&s;tern empire, which was far in the decline, with regard both to military di&s;cipline and to civil policy. Jeru&s;alem, by its &s;ituation, became one of their mo&s;t early conque&s;ts; and the Chri&s;tians had the mortification to &s;ee the holy &s;epulchre, and the other places, made famous by the pre&s;ence of their religious founder, fallen into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of infidels.

They gave little di&s;tur|bance to tho&s;e zealous pilgrims, who daily flocked to Jeru&s;alem; and they allowed every man, after paying a moderate tribute, to vi&s;it the holy &s;epulchre, to per|form his religious duties, and to return in peace. But the Turcomans or Turks, a tribe of Tartars, who had embraced Mahometani&s;m, having wre&s;ted Syria from the Saracens, and having in the year 1065, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Jeru&s;a|lem, rendered the pilgrimage much more difficult and dangerous to the Chri|&s;tians. The barbarity of their manners, and the confu&s;ions attending their un|&s;ettled government, expo&s;ed the pilgrims to many in&s;ults, robberies, and ex|tortions; and the&s;e zealots, returning from their meritorious fatigues and &s;ufferings, filled all Chri&s;tendom with indignation again&s;t the infidels, who profaned the holy city by their pre&s;ence, and derided the &s;acred my&s;teries in the very place of their completion.

<P>THE oppo&s;ition of An&s;elm was the more dangerous on account of the charac|ter of piety, which he &s;oon acquired in England, by his great zeal again&s;t all abu&s;es, particularly tho&s;e in dre&s;s and ornament. There was a mode, which, in that age, prevailed throughout Europe, both among men and women, to give an enormous length to their &s;hoes, to draw the toe to a &s;harp point, and to affix to it the figure of a bird's bill, or &s;ome &s;uch ornament, which was turned up|wards, and which was often &s;u&s;tained by gold or &s;ilver chains tied to the knee<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 682. W. Malme&s;. p. 123. Knyghton, p. 2369.</NOTE>. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics took exception at this ornament, which, they &s;aid, was an at|tempt to bely the &s;cripture, where it is affirmed, that no man can add a cubit to his &s;tature; and they declaimed again&s;t it with great vehemence, nay a&s;&s;embled &s;ome &s;ynods, who ab&s;olutely condemned it. But &s;uch are the &s;trange contradic|tions in human nature! tho' the clergy, at that time, could overturn thrones, and had authority &s;ufficient to &s;end above a million of men on <HI>their</HI> errand to the de&s;arts of A&s;ia, they never could prevail again&s;t the&s;e long-pointed &s;hoes: On the contrary, that caprice, contrary to all other modes, maintained its ground during &s;everal centuries; and if the clergy had not at la&s;t de&s;i&s;ted from their per|&s;ecutions of it, it might &s;till have been the prevailing fa&s;hion in Europe.</P>
<P>BUT An&s;elm was more fortunate in decrying the particular mode, which was the object of his aver&s;ion, and which probably had not taken &s;uch fa&s;t hold of the affections of the people. He preached zealou&s;ly again&s;t the long hair and curled locks, which were then fa&s;hionable among the courtiers; he refu&s;ed the a&s;hes on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day to tho&s;e who were &s;o accoutered; and his authority and elo|quence had &s;uch influence, that the young men univer&s;ally abandoned that orna|ment, and appeared in the cropt hair, which was recommended to them by the &s;ermons of the primate. The noted hi&s;torian of An&s;elm, who was al&s;o his com|panion and &s;ecretary, celebrates highly this effort of his zeal and piety<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 23.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1100" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The croi|&s;ades.</NOTE> AFTER the croi&s;es were a&s;&s;embled on the banks of the Bo&s;phorus, oppo|&s;ite to Con&s;tantinople, they proceeded on their enterprize; but immedi|ately experienced tho&s;e difficulties, which their zeal had hitherto concealed from them, and for which, even if they had for&s;een them, it would have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to provide a proper remedy. The Greek Emperor, Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to the we&s;tern Chri&s;tians for &s;uccour again&s;t the Turks, enter|tained hope, and that but a feeble one, of only obtaining &s;uch a moderate &s;upply, as, acting under his command, might enable him to repul&s;e the enemy: But he was extremely a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee his dominions overwhelmed, on a &s;udden, with &s;uch an inundation of licentious barbarians, who, tho' they pretended friend&s;hip, de&s;pi&s;ed his &s;ubjects as unwarlike, and dete&s;ted them as heretical. By all the arts of policy, in which he excelled, he endeavoured to divert the torrent; but while he employed profe&s;&s;ions, care&s;&s;es, civilities, and &s;eeming &s;ervices towards the leaders of the croi&s;ade, he &s;ecretly regarded tho&s;e imperious allies as more dan|gerous than the open enemies, by whom his empire had been formerly invaded. Having effectuated that difficult point of di&s;embarking them &s;afely in A&s;ia, he entered into a private corre&s;pondence with Soliman, Emperor of the Turks; and practi&s;ed every in&s;idious art, which his genius, his power, or his &s;ituation enabled him to employ, for di&s;appointing the enterprize, and di&s;couraging the Latins from making thenceforward any &s;uch prodigious migrations. His dan|gerous policy was &s;econded by the di&s;orders, in&s;eparable from &s;o va&s;t a multitude, who were not united under one head, and were conducted by leaders of the mo&s;t independant, intractable &s;pirits, unacquainted with military di&s;cipline, and &s;till more enemies to civil authority and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, the

exce&s;&s;es of fatigue, the influence of unknown climates, joined to the want of con|cert in their operations, and the &s;word of a warlike enemy, de&s;troyed the croi&s;es by thou&s;ands, and would have abated the ardor of men, impelled to war by le&s;s powerful motives. Their zeal, however, their bravery, and their irre&s;i&s;tible force &s;till carried them forward, and continually advanced them to the great end of their enterprizes. After an ob&s;tinate &s;iege, they took Nice, the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h empire; they defeated Soliman in two great battles; they made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of Antioch; and entirely broke the force of the Turks, who had &s;o long retained the&s;e countries in &s;ubjection. The &s;oldan of Egypt, who&s;e alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on the fall of the Turki&s;h power, his former authority in Jeru&s;alem; and informed them by his amba&s;&s;adors, that, if they came di&s;armed to that city, they might now perform their religious vows, and that all Chri&s;tian pilgrims, who &s;hould thenceforth vi&s;it the holy &s;epulchre, might expect the &s;ame good treatment, which they had ever received from his predece&s;&s;ors. This offer was rejected; the &s;oldan was required to yield up the city to the Chri&s;tians; and on his refu&s;al, the croi&s;es advanced to the &s;iege of Jeru&s;alem, which they regarded as the con&s;ummation of their labours. By the detachments, which they had made, and the di&s;a&s;ters, which they had undergone, they were dimini&s;hed to the number of twenty thou&s;and foot and fifteen hundred hor&s;e; but the&s;e were &s;till formidable from their valor, their experience, and the obedience, which, at the price of pa&s;t calamities, they had learned to pay to their leaders. After a &s;iege of five weeks, they took Jeru&s;alem by a&s;&s;ault; and, impelled by a mixture of military and religious rage, they put the numerous garri&s;on and inhabitants to the &s;word without di&s;tinction. Neither arms defended the valiant, nor &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the timorous: No age nor &s;ex was &s;pared: Infants on the brea&s;t were pierced by the &s;ame blow with their mothers, who implored for mercy: Even a multitude, to the number of ten thou&s;and per&s;ons, who had &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners, and were promi&s;ed quarter, were butchered in cold blood by the&s;e ferocious conquerors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. 1. p. 57.</NOTE>.

A|mong the&s;e, was Robert, duke of Normandy, who, as he had abandoned the greate&s;t dominions of any prince, that attended the croi&s;ade, had all along di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the mo&s;t intrepid courage<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 35. W. Heming. p. 467. G. Newbrig, p 358.</NOTE>, as well as by that affable di&s;|po&s;ition and unbounded genero&s;ity, which gain the hearts of &s;oldiers, and qualify a prince to &s;hine in a military life. In pa&s;&s;ing thro' Italy, he became acquainted with Sibylla, daughter of the count of Conver&s;ana, a young lady of great beauty and merit, whom he e&s;pou&s;ed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 153. Gul. Gemet. p. 299.</NOTE>; and indulging him&s;elf in this new pa&s;&s;ion, as well as fond of enjoying ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, after the fatigues of &s;o many rough campaigns, he lingered a twelvemonth in that delicious climate; and tho' his friends in the north looked every moment for his arrival, none of them knew when they could with certainty expect it. By this delay, he lo&s;t the kingdom of England, which the great fame he had acquired during the croi&s;ades, as well as his undoubted title, both by birth, and by the preceding agreement with his de|cea&s;ed brother, would, had he been pre&s;ent, have infallibly &s;ecured to him.</P>

He had &s;carcely reached the place when Wil|liam de Breteuil, keeper of the trea&s;ure, arrived, and oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to Henry's preten&s;ions. This nobleman, who had been engaged in the &s;ame party of hunt|ing, had no &s;ooner heard of his ma&s;ter's death, than he ha&s;tened to take care of his charge; and he told the prince, that this trea&s;ure, as well as the crown, be|longed to his elder brother, who was now his &s;overeign; and that he him&s;elf, for his part, was determined, in &s;pite of all other preten&s;ions, to maintain his allegiance to him.

<P>HENRY, without lo&s;ing a moment, ha&s;tened with his money to London; and having a&s;&s;embled &s;ome noblemen and prelates, whom his addre&s;s, or abilities, or pre&s;ents, gained to his &s;ide, he was &s;uddenly elected, or rather &s;aluted King; and immediately proceeded to the exerci&s;e of the royal dignity. In le&s;s than three days after his brother's death, the ceremonial of his coronation was performed by Maurice, bi&s;hop of London, who was per&s;uaded to officiate on that occa&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 783.</NOTE>; and thus, by his courage and celerity, he intruded him&s;elf into the vacant throne. No one had &s;ufficient &s;pirit or &s;en&s;e of duty to appear in defence of the ab&s;ent prince: All men were &s;educed or intimidated: Pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;upplied the apparent deficiencies of Henry's title, which was indeed founded on plain u&s;ur|pation: And the barons, as well as the people, acquie&s;ced in a claim, which, tho' it could neither be ju&s;tified nor comprehended, could now, they found, be oppo&s;ed only thro' the perils of civil war and rebellion.</P>
<P>BUT as Henry ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that a crown, u&s;urped again&s;t all rules of ju&s;tice, would &s;it very un&s;teady on his head, he re&s;olved, by fair profe&s;&s;ions at lea&s;t, to gain the affections of all his &s;ubjects. Be&s;ides taking the u&s;ual coronation-oath to maintain the laws and execute ju&s;tice, he pa&s;&s;ed a charter, which was calculated to remedy many of the grievous oppre&s;&s;ions, which had been complained of du|ring the reign of his father and brother<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

He there promi&s;ed, that, upon the death of any bi&s;hop or abbot, he never would &s;eize the revenues of the &s;ee or ab|bey during the vacancy, but would leave the whole to be reaped by the &s;ucce&s;|ce&s;&s;or; and that he would never let to farm any eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice, nor di&s;|po&s;e of it for money. After this conce&s;&s;ion to the church, who&s;e favour was of &s;o great con&s;equence, he proceeded to enumerate the civil grievances, which he purpo&s;ed to redre&s;s. He promi&s;ed, that, upon the death of any earl, baron, or military tenant, his heir &s;hould be admitted to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, on paying a ju&s;t and lawful relief; without being expo&s;ed to &s;uch exorbitant exac|tions as had been required during the late reigns: He remitted the ward&s;hip of minors, and allowed guardians to be appointed, who &s;hould be an&s;werable for the tru&s;t: He promi&s;ed not to di&s;po&s;e of any heire&s;s in marriage, but by the ad|vice of all the barons; and if any baron intended to give his daughter, &s;i&s;ter, niece, or kin&s;woman, in marriage, it &s;hould only be nece&s;&s;ary for him to con&s;ult the King, who promi&s;ed to take no money for his con&s;ent, nor ever to refu&s;e permi&s;&s;ion, un|le&s;s the per&s;on to whom it was propo&s;ed to marry her &s;hould happen to be his ene|my:

He granted his barons and military tenants the power of bequeathing by will their money or per&s;onal e&s;tates; and if they neglected to make a will, he promi&s;ed, that their heirs &s;hould &s;ucceed to them: He remitted the right of im|po&s;ing moneyage, and of levying taxes at plea&s;ure on the farms, which the ba|rons retained in their own hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix II.</NOTE>: He made &s;ome general profe&s;&s;ions of mo|derating fines; he offered a pardon for all offences; and he remitted all debts due to the crown: He required, that the va&s;&s;als of the barons &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame privileges, which he granted to his own barons; and he promi&s;ed a general con|firmation and ob&s;ervance of the laws of King Edward. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the chief articles contained in that famous charter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 38. Hoveden, p. 468. Brompton, p. 1021. Hagul&s;tad. p. 310.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To give greater authenticity to the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, Henry lodged a copy of his charter in &s;ome abbey of each county; as if de&s;irous, that it &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the eyes of all his &s;ubjects, and remain as a perpetual rule for the limitation and direction of his government: Yet is it certain, that, after the pre&s;ent turn was &s;erved, he never once thought, during his reign, of ob&s;erving one &s;ingle ar|ticle of it; and the whole fell &s;o much into neglect and oblivion, that, in the fol|lowing century, when the barons, who had heard an ob&s;cure tradition of it, de&s;ired to make it the model of the great charter, which they exacted from King John, they could only find one copy of it in the whole kingdom. But as to the grie|vances here propo&s;ed to be redre&s;&s;ed, they were &s;till continued in their full extent; and the royal authority, in all the&s;e heads, lay under no manner of re&s;triction. Reliefs of heirs, &s;o capital an article, were never effectually fixed till the time of Magna Charta<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 36.

moveables, and to exclude every heir, even the children of the decea&s;ed: A &s;ure mark of a tyrannical and arbitrary government.</P>
<P>THE Normans indeed, &s;ettled in England, were, during this age, &s;o violent and licentious a people, that they may be pronounced incapable of any true or regular liberty; which requires &s;uch a refinement of laws and in&s;titutions, &s;uch a comprehen&s;ion of views, &s;uch a &s;entiment of honour, &s;uch a &s;pirit of obedience, and &s;uch a &s;acrifice of private intere&s;ts and connexions to public order, as can only be the re&s;ult of great reflection and experience, and mu&s;t grow to perfection du|ring &s;everal ages of a &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed government. A people, &s;o in&s;en|&s;ible to the rights of their &s;overeign, as to disjoint, without nece&s;&s;ity, the here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and permit a younger brother to intrude him&s;elf into the place of the elder, whom they e&s;teemed, and who was guilty of no crime but being ab&s;ent, could not expect, that that prince would pay any greater regard to their privileges, or allow his engagements to fetter his power, and debar him from any con&s;iderable intere&s;t or convenience. They had indeed arms in their hands, which prevented the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a total de&s;poti&s;m, and left their po&s;terity &s;ufficient power, whenever they &s;hould attain a &s;ufficient degree of rea&s;on, to ac|quire true liberty: But their turbulent di&s;po&s;ition prompted them frequently to make &s;uch u&s;e of their arms, that they were more fitted to ob&s;truct the exe|cution of ju&s;tice, than to &s;top the career of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. The prince, finding, that greater oppo&s;ition was often made to him when he enforced the laws, than when he violated them, was apt to render his own will and plea&s;ure the &s;ole rule of government, and on every emergence to con&s;ider more the power of the per&s;ons whom he might offend, than the rights of tho&s;e whom he might injure. The very form of this charter of Henry proves, that the Norman ba|rons (for they, rather than the people of England, are chiefly concerned in it) were totally ignorant of the nature of limited monarchy, and were ill qualified to conduct, in conjunction with their &s;overeign, the machine of government. It is an act of his &s;ole power, is the re&s;ult of his free grace, implies &s;everal articles which bind others as well as him&s;elf, and is therefore unfit to be the deed of any one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the whole legi&s;lative power, and who may not at plea&s;ure revoke all his conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>KING Henry, farther to increa&s;e his popularity, degraded and committed to pri|&s;on Ralph Flambard, bi&s;hop of Durham, who had been the chief in&s;trument of op|pre&s;&s;ion employed by his brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

On the arrival of the prelate, he propo&s;ed to him the renewal of that homage which he had done his brother, and which had never been refu&s;ed by any Engli&s;h bi&s;hop: But An&s;elm had acquired other &s;entiments by his journey to Rome, and gave the King an ab&s;olute refu&s;al. He objected the decrees of the council of Bari, at which he him&s;elf had a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and he declared, that, &s;o far from doing homage for his &s;piritual dignity, he would not &s;o much as commu|nicate withh any eccle&s;ia&s;tic who paid that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or who accepted of inve&s;ti|tures from laymen. Henry, who propo&s;ed, in his pre&s;ent delicate &s;ituation, to reap great advantages from the authority and popularity of An&s;elm, dared not to quarrel with him by in&s;i&s;ting on his demand<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King.</NOTE> THERE immediately occurred an important affair, in which the King was obliged to have recour&s;e to the authority of An&s;elm. Matilda, daughter of Mal|colm III. King of Scotland, and niece to Edgar Atheling, had, on her father's death, and the &s;ub&s;equent revolutions of the Scotti&s;h government, been brought up to England, and educated under her aunt, Chri&s;tina, in the nunnery of Rum|&s;ey. This prince&s;s Henry propo&s;ed to marry; but as &s;he had worn the veil, tho' never taken the vows, doubts might ari&s;e concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the act; and it behoved him to be very careful not to &s;hock, in any particular, the religious prejudices of his &s;ubjects. The affair was examined by An&s;elm in a council of the prelates and nobles, which was &s;ummoned at Lambeth; and Ma|tilda there proved, that &s;he had put on the veil, not with a view of entering into a religious life, but merely in imitation of a cu&s;tom, familiar to the Engli&s;h la|dies, who protected their cha&s;tity from the brutal violence of the Normans, by taking &s;helter under that habit<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 57.</NOTE>, which, amid&s;t the horrible licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the times, was generally revered. The council, &s;en&s;ible that even a prince&s;s had otherwi&s;e no &s;ecurity for her honour, admitted this rea&s;on as valid: They pro|nounced, that Matilda was &s;till free to marry<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and her e&s;pou&s;als with Henry were celebrated by An&s;elm with great pomp and &s;olemnity<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 468.</NOTE>. No act of the

King's reign rendered him equally popular with his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and tended more to e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne. Tho' Matilda, during the life of her uncle and brothers, was not the heir of the Saxon line, &s;he was become very dear to the Engli&s;h, on account of her connexions with it: And that people, who, before the conque&s;t, had fallen into a kind of indifference towards their antient royal family, had felt &s;o &s;everely the tyranny of the Normans, that they reflected with infinite regret on their former liberty, and hoped for a more equal and mild ad|mini&s;tration, when the blood of their native princes &s;hould be united with that of their new &s;overeigns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

<P><MILESTONE N="1107" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Continuation of the quarrel with An&s;elm, the primate.</NOTE> A little after Henry had compleated the conque&s;t of Normandy, and &s;ettled the government of that province, he fini&s;hed a controver&s;y, which had been long depending, between him and the Pope, with regard to the inve&s;titures in eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices; and tho' he was here obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;ome of the antient rights of the crown, he extricated him&s;elf on ea&s;ier terms than mo&s;t princes, who in that age were &s;o unhappy as to be engaged in di&s;putes with the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. The King's &s;ituation, in the beginning of his reign, obliged him to pay great court to An&s;elm; and the advantages, which he had reaped from the zealous friend&s;hip of that prelate, had made him &s;en&s;ible how prone the minds of his peo|ple were to &s;uper&s;tition, and what an a&s;cendant the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had been able to a&s;&s;ume over them. He had &s;een, on the acce&s;&s;ion of his brother Rufus, that, tho' the rights of primogeniture were then violated, and the inclinations of almo&s;t all the barons oppo&s;ed, yet the authority of Lanfranc had prevailed over all other con&s;iderations; and his own ca&s;e, which was &s;till more unfavourable, afforded an in&s;tance, in which the clergy could &s;how more evidently their influence and authority. The&s;e recent examples, while they made him cautious not to offend that powerful body, convinced him, at the &s;ame time, that it was ex|tremely his intere&s;t, to retain the former prerogative of the crown in filling of|fices of &s;uch va&s;t importance, and to check the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in that independance, to which they evidently a&s;pired. The choice, which his brother, in a fit of pe|nitence, had made of An&s;elm, was &s;o far unfortunate to the King's preten&s;ions, that that prelate was celebrated for his piety and zeal and au&s;terity of manners; and tho' his monki&s;h devotion and narrow principles progno&s;ticated no great knowledge of the world nor depth of policy, he was, on that very account, a more dangerous in&s;trument in the hands of politicians, and retained a greater

<P>THE policy of the court of Rome has been commonly much admired; and men, judging by &s;ucce&s;s, have be&s;towed the highe&s;t eulogies on that prudence; by which a power, from &s;uch &s;lender beginnings, could advance, without force of arms, to e&s;tabli&s;h an univer&s;al and almo&s;t ab&s;olute monarchy in Europe. But the wi&s;dom of &s;uch a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men, who filled the papal throne, and who were of &s;uch different ages, tempers, and intere&s;ts, is not intelligible, and could never have place in nature.

While the court of Rome was openly abandoned to the mo&s;t flagrant di&s;orders, even while it was torne with &s;chi&s;ms and factions, the power of the church made daily a &s;en&s;ible progre&s;s in Europe; and the temerity of Gregory and the caution of Pa&s;cal were equally fortunate in promoting it. The clergy, feeling the nece&s;&s;ity of protection again&s;t the violence of princes, or vigor of the laws, were well plea&s;ed to adhere to a foreign head, who, being removed from the fear of the civil authority, could freely employ the power of the whole church to defend their antient or u&s;urped properties and privileges, when invaded in any particular country: The monks, de&s;irous of an independance on their dio|ce&s;ans, profe&s;&s;ed &s;till a more devoted attachment to the triple crown; and the &s;tupid people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no &s;cience nor rea&s;on, which they could oppo&s;e to the mo&s;t exorbitant preten&s;ions.

The Pope allowed An&s;elm to communicate with the prelates, who had already received inve&s;titures from the crown; and he only required of them &s;ome &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions for their pa&s;t mi&s;conduct<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 87.</NOTE>.

<P>DURING the cour&s;e of the&s;e controver&s;ies, a &s;ynod was held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where the King, intent only on the main di&s;pute, allowed &s;ome canons of le&s;s con|&s;equence

For as the art of writing was then rare, and pari&s;h-regi&s;|ters were not regularly kept, it was n t ea&s;y to a&s;certain the degrees of affinity even among people of rank; and any man, who had money &s;ufficient to pay for it, might obtain a divorce, under pretence that his wife was more nearly related to him than was permitted by the canons.

The aver&s;ion of the clergy to this mode was not confined to England.

After this manner, the Pope, finding that the French nation would not admit his claim of granting inve&s;titures, had pa&s;&s;ed a bull, giving the king that authority; and he now practi&s;ed a like invention to elude the complaints of the King of England. He made the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury his legate, renewed his commi&s;&s;ion from time to time, and &s;till pretended, that the rights, which that prelate had ever exerci&s;ed as metropo|litan, were entirely derived from the indulgence of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee.

They nominated to all vacant benefices, a&s;&s;embled &s;ynods, and were anxious to main|tain eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, which never could be fully protected without incroachments on the civil power. If there was the lea&s;t concurrence or oppo&s;ition, it was always &s;uppo&s;ed that the civil power was to give way: Every deed, which had the lea&s;t pretence of holding of any thing &s;piritual, as mar|riage, te&s;taments, promi&s;&s;ory oaths, were brought into the &s;piritual court, and could not be canva&s;|&s;ed before a civil magi&s;trate. The&s;e were the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the church; and where a legate was &s;ent immediately from Rome, he was &s;ure to maintain the papal claims with the utmo&s;t rigor: But it was an advantage to the King to have the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury appointed legate, becau&s;e the connexions of that prelate with the kingdom tended to moderate his mea&s;ures.</NOTE>.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1135" UNIT="year"> IN the progre&s;s and &s;ettlement of the feudal law, the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to fiefs had taken place &s;ome time before the female was admitted; and e&s;tates, being con&s;idered as military benefices, not as property, were tran&s;mitted to &s;uch only as could &s;erve in the armies, and perform in per&s;on the conditions upon which they were originally granted. But after that the continuance of rights, during &s;ome generations, in the &s;ame family, had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, obliterated the pri|mitive idea, the females were gradually admitted to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of feudal pro|perty; and the &s;ame revolution of principles, which procured them the inhe|ritance of private e&s;tates, naturally introduced their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to government and authority. The failure, therefore, of male-heirs to the kingdom of England and dutchy of Normandy, &s;eemed to leave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open, without a rival, to the empre&s;s, Matilda; and as Henry had made all his va&s;&s;als in both &s;tates &s;wear fealty to her, he pre&s;umed, that they would not ea&s;ily be induced to depart at once from her hereditary right, and from their own reiterated oaths and en|gagements. But the irregular manner, in which he him&s;elf had acquired the crown, might in&s;truct him, that neither his Norman nor Engli&s;h &s;ubjects were as yet capable of adhering to a &s;trict rule of government; and as every precedent of this kind &s;eems to give authority to new u&s;urpations, he had rea&s;on to dread, even from his own family, &s;ome inva&s;ion of his daughter's title, which he had taken &s;uch pains to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>Adela, daughter of William, the Conqueror, had been married to Stephen, count of Blois, and had brought him &s;everal &s;ons; among whom, Stephen, and Henry, the two younge&s;t, had been invited over to England by the late King, and had received great honours, riches, and preferment from the zealous friend|&s;hip, which that prince bore to every one, that had been &s;o fortunate as to ac|quire
<PB N="248" REF="254">
his favour and good opinion. Henry, who had betaken him&s;elf to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical profe&s;&s;ion, was created abbot of Gla&s;tenbury and bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter; and tho' the&s;e dignities were con&s;iderable, Stephen, his brother, had, from his uncle's liberality, attained e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;till more &s;olid and durable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. p 360. Brompton, p. 1023.</NOTE>. The King had married him to Matilda, who was daughter and heir of Eu&s;tace count of Boulogne, and who brought him, be&s;ides that feudal &s;overeignty in France, an immen&s;e property in England, which, in the di&s;tribution of lands, had been conferred by the Conqueror on the family of Boulogne. Stephen al&s;o by this marriage acquired a new connexion with the royal family of England; as Mary, his wife's mother, was &s;i&s;ter to David, the pre&s;ent King of Scotland, and to Matilda, the fir&s;t wife of Henry, and mother of the empre&s;s. The King, &s;till imagining, that he &s;trengthened the intere&s;ts of his family by the aggran|dizement of Stephen, took a plea&s;ure in enriching him by the grant of new po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions; and he conferred on him the great e&s;tate forfeited by Robert Mallet in England, and that forfeited by the earl of Mortaigne in Normandy. Stephen, in return, profe&s;&s;ed a great attachment to his uncle; and appeared &s;o zealous for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Matilda, that when the barons &s;wore fealty to that prince&s;s, he con|tended with Robert, earl of Gloce&s;ter, the King's natural &s;on, who &s;hould fir&s;t be admitted to give her this te&s;timony of devoted zeal and fidelity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 192.</NOTE>. Mean while, he continued to cultivate, by every art of popularity, the friend&s;hip and affection of the Engli&s;h nation; and many virtues, with which he &s;eemed to be endowed, favoured the &s;ucce&s;s of his intentions. By his bravery, activity and vigor, he acquired the e&s;teem of the barons: By his genero&s;ity, and by an af|fable and familiar addre&s;s, unu&s;ual in that age among men of his high quality, he obtained the affections of the people, particularly of the Londoners<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. Ge&s;t. Step. p 928.</NOTE>. And tho' he dared not to take any &s;teps towards his farther grandeur, le&s;t he might expo&s;e him&s;elf to the jealou&s;y of &s;o penetrating a prince as Henry; he &s;till hoped, that, by accumulating riches and power, and by acquiring popularity, he might &s;ome time be able to open his way to the throne.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Henry expired, than Stephen, in&s;en&s;ible to all the ties of gra|titude and fidelity, and blind to danger, gave full reins to his criminal ambi|tion, and tru&s;ted, that, even without any previous intrigue, the celerity of his enterprize and the boldne&s;s of his attempt might overcome the weak attachment, which the Engli&s;h and Normans in that age bore to the laws, and to the rights of their &s;overeign. He ha&s;tened over to England; and tho' the citizens of Dover, and tho&s;e of Canterbury, apprized of his purpo&s;e, &s;hut their gates again&s;t him,

he &s;topped not till he arrived at London, where &s;ome of the lower rank, in&s;tigated by his emi&s;&s;aries, as well as moved by his general popularity, immediately &s;aluted him King.

<P><MILESTONE N="1154" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Europe.</NOTE> THE exten&s;ive confederacies, by which the European potentates are now at once united and &s;et in oppo&s;ition to each other, and which, tho' they diffu&s;e the lea&s;t &s;park of di&s;&s;en&s;ion thro' the whole, are at lea&s;t attended with this advantage, that they prevent any violent revolutions or conque&s;ts in particular &s;tates, were totally unknown in antient ages; and the theory of foreign politics, in each kingdom, formed a &s;peculation much le&s;s complicate and involved than at pre&s;ent: Commerce had not yet bound the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations together in &s;o clo&s;e a chain: Wars, fini&s;hed in one campaign and often in one battle, were little affected by the movements of remote &s;tates: The imperfect communication among the kingdoms, and their ignorance of each other's &s;ituation, made it im|practicable for a great number of them to combine in any one project or effort: And above all, the turbulent &s;pirit and independant &s;ituation of the barons or great va&s;&s;als in each &s;tate gave &s;o much occupation to the &s;overeign, that he was obliged to confine his attention chiefly to his own &s;y&s;tem of government, and was more indifferent about what pa&s;&s;ed among his neighbours. Religion only, not politics, carried abroad the views of princes; and either fixed their thoughts on the Holy Land, who&s;e conque&s;t and defence was deemed a point of common ho|nour and intere&s;t, or engaged them in intrigues with the court of Rome, to whom they had yielded the direction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and who was every day a&s;|&s;uming more authority than they were willing to allow her.</P>
<P>BEFORE the conque&s;t of England by the duke of Normandy, this i&s;land was as much &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world in politics as in &s;ituation; and ex|cept from the inroads of the Dani&s;h pirates, the Engli&s;h, happily confined at
<PB N="263" REF="269">
home, had neither enemies nor allies on the continent. The foreign dominions of William connected them with the Kings and great va&s;&s;als of France; and while the oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions of the Pope and Emperor in Italy produced a continual intercour&s;e between Germany and that country, the two great monarchs of France and England formed, in another part of Europe, a &s;eparate &s;y&s;tem, and carried on their wars and negotiations, without meeting either with oppo&s;ition or &s;upport from the others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> ON the decline of the Carlovingian race, the nobles, in every province of France, taking advantage of the &s;overeign's weakne&s;s, and obliged to provide, each for his own defence, again&s;t the ravages of the Norman freebooters, had a&s;&s;umed, both in civil and military affairs, an authority almo&s;t independant, and had reduced, within very narrow limits, the prerogative of their princes. The acce&s;&s;ion of Hugh Capet, by annexing a great fief to the crown, had brought &s;ome addition of power to the royal dignity; but this fief, tho' con&s;iderable for a &s;ubject, appeared a narrow ba&s;is of force, in a prince who was placed at the head of &s;o great a community. The royal deme&s;nes con&s;i&s;ted only of Paris, Orleans, E&s;tampes, Compiegne, and a few places, &s;cattered over the northern provinces: In all the re&s;t of the kingdom, the prince's authority was more no|minal than real: The va&s;&s;als were accu&s;tomed, nay intitled, to make war, without his permi&s;&s;ion, on each other: They were even entitled, if they conceived them|&s;elves to be injured, to turn their arms again&s;t their &s;overeign: They exerci&s;ed all civil juri&s;diction, without appeal, over their tenants and inferior va&s;&s;als: Their common jealou&s;y of the crown ea&s;ily united them again&s;t any attempt on their exorbitant privileges; and as &s;ome of them had attained the power and authority of great princes, even the &s;malle&s;t baron was &s;ure of immediate and effectual pro|tection. Be&s;ides &s;ix eccle&s;ia&s;tical peerages, which, with the other immunities of the church, cramped extremely the general execution of ju&s;tice; there were &s;ix lay-peerages, Burgundy, Normandy, Guienne, Flanders, Tholou&s;e, and Cham|pagne, which formed very exten&s;ive and pui&s;&s;ant &s;overeignties. And tho' the combination of all the&s;e princes and barons could on occa&s;ion mu&s;ter a mighty power: Yet was it very difficult to &s;et that great machine in movement; it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve harmony in its parts; a &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t alone could, for a time, unite them under their &s;overeign again&s;t a common enemy; but if the King attempted to turn the force of the community again&s;t any mutinous va&s;|&s;al, the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t made the others oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the &s;ucce&s;s of his preten&s;ions. Lewis the Gro&s;s, the la&s;t &s;overeign, marched, at one time, to his frontiers again&s;t the Germans at the head of an army of two hundred thou&s;and men; but a petty lord of Corbeil, of Pui&s;et, of Couci, was able, at
<PB N="264" REF="270">
another time, to &s;et that prince at defiance, and to maintain open war again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE authority of the Engli&s;h monarch was much more exten&s;ive within his kingdom, and the di&s;proportion much greater between him and the mo&s;t power|ful of his va&s;&s;als. His deme&s;nes and revenue were very large, compared to the greatne&s;s of his &s;tate: He was accu&s;tomed to levy arbitrary exactions from his &s;ubjects: His courts of judicature exerci&s;ed juri&s;diction in every part of the king|dom: He could cru&s;h by his power, or by a judicial &s;entence, well or ill found|ed, any obnoxious baron: And tho' the feudal in&s;titutions, which prevailed in his kingdom, had the &s;ame tendency, as in other &s;tates, to exalt the ari&s;tocracy, and depre&s;s the monarchy, it required, in England, according to its pre&s;ent con&s;titution, a great combination of the va&s;&s;als to oppo&s;e their &s;overeign lord, and there had not hitherto ari&s;en any baron &s;o powerful, as of him&s;elf to make war again&s;t the prince, and afford protection to the inferior barons.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;uch were the different &s;ituations of France and England, and the lat|ter enjoyed &s;o great advantages over the former; the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry II. a prince of great abilities, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many rich provinces on the continent, might appear an event dangerous, if not fatal, to the French monarchy, and &s;ufficient to break entirely the ballance between the &s;tates. He was ma&s;ter, in the right of his father, of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine; in that of his mother, of Normandy; in that of his wife, of Guienne, Poictou, Xaintonge, Auvergne, Perigord, Angoumois, the Limou&s;in. He &s;oon after annexed Britanny to his other &s;tates, and was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;uperiority over that province, which, on the fir&s;t ce&s;&s;ion of Normandy to Rollo the Dane, had, by Charles the Simple, been granted in va&s;&s;alage to that formidable ravager. The&s;e provinces compo&s;ed above a third of the whole French monarchy, and were much &s;uperior, in extent and opulence, to tho&s;e territories, which were &s;ubjected to the immediate juri&s;|diction and government of the King. The va&s;&s;al was here more powerful than his liege lord: The &s;ituation, which had enabled Hugh Capet to depo&s;e the Carlovingian princes, &s;eemed here to be renewed, and that with much greater advantages on the &s;ide of the va&s;&s;al: And when England was added to &s;o many provinces, the French King had rea&s;on to apprehend, from this conjuncture, &s;ome great di&s;a&s;ter to him&s;elf and to his family. But in reality, it was this circum&s;tance, which appeared &s;o formidable, that &s;aved the Capetian race, and by its con&s;equences, exalted them to that pitch of grandeur, which they at pre|&s;ent enjoy.</P>
<P>THE limited authority of the prince in the feudal con&s;titutions prevented the King of England from employing with advantage the force of &s;o many &s;tates,
<PB N="265" REF="271">
which were &s;ubjected to his government; and the&s;e different members, disjoined in &s;ituation, and di&s;agreeing in laws, language and manners, were never thoroughly cemented into one monarchy. He &s;oon became, both from his di&s;tant place of re&s;idence and from the incompatability of intere&s;ts, a kind of foreigner to his French dominions; and his &s;ubjects on the continent con&s;idered their allegiance as more naturally due to their &s;uperior lord, who lived in their neighbourhood, and who was acknowledged to be the &s;upreme head of their nation. He was always at hand to invade them; their immediate lord was often at too great a di&s;tance to protect them; and any di&s;order in any part of his di&s;per&s;ed dominions gave advantages again&s;t him. The other powerful va&s;&s;als of the French crown were rather plea&s;ed to &s;ee the expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, and were not affected with that jealou&s;y, which would have ari&s;en from the oppre&s;&s;ion of a co-va&s;&s;al, who was of the &s;ame rank with them&s;elves. By this means, the King of France found it more ea&s;y to conquer the&s;e numerous provinces from England, than to &s;ubdue a duke of Normandy or Guienne, a count of Anjou, Maine or Poictou. And after reducing &s;uch exten&s;ive territories, which immediately co-alited with the body of the monarchy, he found greater facility of uniting to the crown the other great fiefs, which &s;till remained &s;eparate and independant.</P>
<P>BUT as the&s;e important con&s;equences could not be fore&s;een by human wi&s;dom, the French King remarked with terror the ri&s;ing grandeur of the hou&s;e of Anjou or Plantagenet; and in order to retard its progre&s;s, he had ever maintained a &s;trict union with Stephen, and had endeavoured to &s;upport the tottering fortunes of that bold u&s;urper. But after this prince's death, it was too late to think of oppo&s;ing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Henry, or preventing the performance of tho&s;e &s;tipu|lations, which, with the unanimous con&s;ent of the nation, he had made with his predece&s;&s;or. The Engli&s;h, tired with civil wars, and di&s;gu&s;ted with the blood|&s;hed and depredations, which, during the cour&s;e of &s;o many years, had attended them, were little di&s;po&s;ed to violate their oaths, by excluding the lawful heir from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their monarchy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth.

Many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable for|tre&s;&s;es were in the hands of his partizans; the whole nation had had occa&s;ion to &s;ee the noble qualities with which he was endowed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gul.

<P>THE union of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers &s;erves extremely, in every ci|vilized government, to the maintenance of peace and order; and prevents tho&s;e mutual incroachments, which, as there can be no ultimate judge between them, are often attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. Whether the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, who unites the&s;e powers, receive the appellation of prince or prelate, is not material: The &s;uperior weight, which temporal intere&s;ts commonly bear in the apprehen&s;ions of men above &s;piritual, renders the civil part of his charac|ter mo&s;t prevalent; and in time prevents tho&s;e gro&s;s impo&s;tures and bigotted per&s;ecutions, which, in all fal&s;e religions, are the chief foundation of clerical au|thority. But during the progre&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical u&s;urpations, the &s;tate, by the re&s;i&s;tance of the civil magi&s;trate, is naturally thrown into convul&s;ions; and it be|hoves the prince, both for his own intere&s;t, and for that of the public, to pro|vide in time &s;ufficient barriers again&s;t &s;o dangerous and in&s;idious a rival. This precaution had been hitherto much neglected in England, as well as in other catholic countries; and affairs at la&s;t &s;eemed to have come to a dangerous cri&s;is: A &s;overeign of the greate&s;t abilities was now on the throne: A prelate of the mo&s;t inflexible and intrepid character was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the primacy: The con|tending powers appeared to be armed with their full force, and it was natural to expect &s;ome extraordinary event to re&s;ult from their rencounter.</P>

<P>THE King was not content with this &s;entence, however violent and oppre&s;&s;ive. Next day, he demanded of Becket the &s;um of three hundred pounds, which the pri|mate had levied from the honours of Eye and Berkham, while in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>IT is apparent, from the known character of Henry, and from the u&s;ual vigi|lance of his government, that when he promoted Becket to the &s;ee of Canterbury, he was, on good grounds, well plea&s;ed with his admini&s;tration in the former high office, with which he had entru&s;ted him; and that, even if that prelate had di&s;&s;ipated money beyond the income of his place, the King was &s;atisfied, that his expences were not blameable, and had in the main been calculated for his &s;er|vice<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 495.</NOTE>.

This was the tragical end of Thomas a Becket, a prelate of the mo&s;t lofty, intrepid, and inflexible &s;pirit, who was able to cover, to the world and probably to him&s;elf, the enterprizes of pride and ambition, under the di&s;gui&s;e of &s;anctity and of zeal for the intere&s;ts of piety and religion: An extraordinary per|&s;onage, &s;urely, had he been allowed to remain in his fir&s;t &s;tation, and had direct|ed the vehemence of his character to the &s;upport of law and ju&s;tice; in&s;tead of being engaged, by the prejudices of the times, to &s;acrifice all private duties and public connexions to tyes, which he imagined, or repre&s;ented, as &s;uperior to every civil and political con&s;ideration. But no man, who enters into the genius of that age, can rea&s;onably doubt of this prelate's &s;incerity. The &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition was &s;o prevalent, that it infallibly caught every carele&s;s rea&s;oner, much more every one who&s;e intere&s;t, and honour, and ambition, were engaged to &s;upport it.

Throughout that large collection of letters, which bears the name of St. Thomas, we find, in all the retainers of that a&s;piring prelate, no le&s;s than in him&s;elf, a mo&s;t entire and ab&s;olute conviction of the rea&s;on and piety of their own party, and a di&s;dain of their antagoni&s;ts; nor is there le&s;s cant and grimace in their &s;tile, when they addre&s;s each other, than when they compo&s;e manife&s;tos for the peru&s;al of the public. The &s;pirit of revenge, violence, and ambition, which accompanied their conduct, in&s;tead of forming a pre&s;umption of hypocri&s;y, are the &s;ure&s;t pledges of their &s;incere attachment to a cau&s;e, which &s;o much flattered the&s;e domineering pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

Tho' the name and authority of the court of Rome were &s;o terrible in the remote countries of Europe, which were &s;unk in profound ignorance, and were entirely unac|quainted with its character and conduct; the Pope was &s;o little revered at home, that his inveterate enemies &s;urrounded the gates of Rome it&s;elf, and even con|trouled his government in that city; and the amba&s;&s;adors, who, from a di&s;tant extremity of Europe, carried to him the humble, or rather abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t potentate of the age, found the utmo&s;t difficulty to make their way to him, and to throw them&s;elves at his feet.

<P>THE clergy, mean while, tho' their rage was happily diverted from falling on the King, were not idle in magnifying the &s;anctity of Becket; in extolling the merits of his martyrdom; and in magnifying him above all that devoted tribe, who, in &s;everal ages, had, by their blood, cemented the fabric of the temple. Other &s;aints had only borne te&s;timony in their &s;ufferings to the general doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; but Becket had &s;acrificed his life to the power and pri|vileges of the clergy; and this peculiar merit challenged, and not in vain, a &s;uitable acknowledgement to his memory. Endle&s;s were the panegyrics on his virtues; and the miracles, operated by his relicts, were more numerous, more non&s;en&s;ical, and more impudently atte&s;ted, than tho&s;e which ever filled the le|gend of any confe&s;&s;or or martyr. Two years after his death he was canonized by Pope Alexander<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 880. Diceto p. 569</NOTE>; a &s;olemn jubilee was e&s;tabli&s;hed for celebrating his merits; his body was removed to a magnificent &s;hrine, enriched with pre&s;ents from all parts of Chri&s;tendom; pilgrimages were performed to obtain his interce&s;&s;ion with heaven; and it was computed, that, in one year, above an hundred thou&s;and pilgrims arrived in Canterbury, and paid their devotions at his tomb. It is in|deed a mortifying reflection to tho&s;e who are actuated by the love of fame, &s;o ju&s;tly denominated the la&s;t infirmity of noble minds, that the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lator and mo&s;t exalted genius, that ever reformed or enlightened the world, can never expect &s;uch tributes of prai&s;e, as are lavi&s;hed on the memory of a pretended &s;aint, who&s;e whole conduct was probably, to the la&s;t degree, odious or contemptible, and who&s;e indu&s;try was entirely directed to the pur&s;uits of objects pernicious to man|kind. It is only a conqueror, a per&s;onage no le&s;s intitled to our hatred, who can pretend to the attainment of equal renown and glory.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to remark, before we conclude this &s;ubject of Thomas a Becket, that the King, during his controver&s;y with that prelate, was on every

occa&s;ion more anxious than u&s;ual to expre&s;s his zeal for religion, and to avoid all a pearance of a pro&s;ane negligence on that head. He gave his con&s;ent to the impo&s;ing a tax on all his dominions for the delivery of the holy land, now threatened by the famous Saladine; and this tax amounted to two-pence a pound for one year, and a penny a pound for the four &s;ub&s;equent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

During this period, there came over from Germany about thirty heretics of both &s;exes, under the direction of one Gerard; &s;imple ignorant people, who could give no account of their faith, but declared them|&s;elves ready to &s;uffer for the tenets of their ma&s;ter. They made only one con|vert in England, a woman as ignorant as them&s;elves; yet they gave &s;uch um|brage to the clergy, that they were delivered over to the &s;ecular arm, and were puni&s;hed by being burned on the forehead, and then whipped thro' the &s;treets. They &s;eemed to exult in their &s;ufferings, and as they went along, &s;ung the bea|titude, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, when men bate you and per&s;ecute you</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 391.

<P><MILESTONE N="1172" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ire|land.</NOTE> AS Britain was fir&s;t peopled from Gaul, &s;o was Ireland probably from Britain; and the inhabitants of all the&s;e countries &s;eem to have been &s;o many tribes of the Celtae, who derive their origin from an antiquity, that lies far beyond the records of any hi&s;tory or tradition. The Iri&s;h, from the beginning of time, had been buried in the mo&s;t profound barbari&s;m and ignorance; and as they were never conquered or even invaded by the Romans, from whom all the we&s;tern world derived its civility, they continued &s;till in the mo&s;t rude &s;tate of &s;ociety, and were di&s;tingui&s;hed only by tho&s;e vices, to which human nature, not tamed by education nor re&s;trained by laws, is for ever &s;ubject. The &s;mall principalities, into which they were divided, exerci&s;ed perpetual rapine and violence again&s;t each other; the uncertain &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their princes was a continued &s;ource of dome&s;tic convul&s;ions; the u&s;ual title of each petty &s;overeign was the murder of his predece&s;&s;or; courage and force, tho' exerci&s;ed in the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, were more honoured than any pacific virtues; and the mo&s;t &s;imple arts of life, even tillage and agriculture, were almo&s;t wholly unknown among them. They had felt the inva&s;ions of the Danes and the other northern people; but the&s;e in|roads, which had &s;pread barbari&s;m in the other parts of Europe, tended rather to improve the Iri&s;h; and the only towns, which were to be found in the i&s;land, had been planted along the coa&s;t by the freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other inhabitants exerci&s;ed pa&s;turage in the open country; &s;ought protec|tion from any danger in their fore&s;ts and mora&s;&s;es; and being divided by the
<PB N="299" REF="306">
fierce&s;t animo&s;ities again&s;t each other, were &s;till more intent on the means of mutual injury, than on the expedients for common or even for private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BESIDES many &s;mall tribes, there were in the age of Henry II, five principal &s;overeignties in the i&s;land, Mun&s;ter, Lein&s;ter, Meath, Ul&s;ter, and Connaught; and as it had been u&s;ual for one or the other of the&s;e to take the lead in their wars, there was commonly &s;ome prince, who &s;eemed, for the time, to act as monarch of Ireland. Roderic O Connor, King of Connaught, was then ad|vanced to this d gnity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 527.</NOTE>; but his government, ill obeyed even within his own territory, was not capable of uniting the people in any mea&s;ures, either for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of order, or for defence again&s;t foreigners. The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign, been moved, by the pro&s;pect of the&s;e advantages, to attempt the &s;ubjection of Ireland; and a pretence was only wanting to invade a people, who, being always confined to their own i&s;land, had never given any rea&s;on of complaint to any of their neighbours. For this purpo&s;e, he had recour&s;e to Rome, which a&s;&s;umed a right to di&s;po&s;e of kingdoms and empires; and not fore&s;eeing the dangerous di&s;putes, which he was one day to maintain with that &s;ee, he helped, for pre&s;ent, or rather for an imaginary conve|nience, to give &s;anction to claims which were now become dangerous to all &s;ove|reigns. Adrian III. who was then pontiff, was by birth an Engli&s;hman; and being, on that account, di&s;po&s;ed to oblige Henry, he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to act as ma&s;ter of the world, and to make, without any hazard or expence, the acqui|&s;ition of a great i&s;land to his &s;piritual juri&s;diction. The Iri&s;h had, by precedent mi&s;&s;ions from the Britains, been imperfectly converted to Chri&s;tianity; and what the Pope regarded as the &s;ure&s;t mark of their imperfect conver&s;ion, they followed the doctrines of their fir&s;t teachers, and had never acknowledged any &s;ubjection to the &s;ee of Rome. Adrian, therefore, in the year 1156, i&s;&s;ued a bull in favour of Henry; in which, after premi&s;ing, that that prince had ever &s;hown an anxious care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and to encrea&s;e the number of his &s;aints and elect in heaven; he repre&s;ents his de&s;ign of &s;ubduing Ireland as derived from the &s;ame pious motives: He con&s;iders his care of applying previou&s;ly for the apo&s;tolic &s;anction as a &s;ure earne&s;t of &s;ucce&s;s and victory; and having e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a point inconte&s;tible, that all Chri&s;tian kingdoms belong to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it to be his own duty to &s;ow among them the &s;eeds of the go&s;pel, which might in the la&s;t day fructify to their eternal &s;alvation: He exhorts the King to invade Ireland, in order to extirpate the vice and wickedne&s;s of the natives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every hou&s;e, a penny to the &s;ee of Rome: He gives him entire right and authority over the i&s;land, com|mands

The exiled prince had recour&s;e to Henry, who was at that time in Guienne, craved his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to re&s;tore him to his &s;overeignty, and offered, in that ca&s;e, to hold his kingdom in va&s;&s;alage of the crown of England. Henry, who&s;e views were already turned towards making acqui&s;itions in Ireland, readily accepted the offer; but being at that time embara&s;&s;ed by the rebellions of his French &s;ubjects, as well as by his di&s;putes with the &s;ee of Rome, he declined for the pre&s;ent embarking in the enterprize, and gave Dermot no farther a&s;|&s;i&s;tance than letters patent, by which he empowered all his &s;ubjects to aid the Iri&s;h prince in the recovery of his dominions<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>.

Soon after, Fitz-Gerald arrived with ten knights, thirty e&s;quires, and a hundred archers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Girald Camb. p. 766.</NOTE>; and being joined by the former adventurers, compo&s;ed a force which nothing in Ireland was able to with&s;tand. Roderic, the chief monarch of the i&s;land, was defeated in battle; the prince of O&s;&s;ory was obliged to &s;ubmit, and give ho&s;tages for his peaceable behaviour; and Dermot, not content with being re&s;tored to his kingdom of Lein&s;ter, projected the dethronement of Roderic, and a&s;pired to the &s;ole dominion of the i&s;land.</P>

Richard, not &s;atisfied with the general allowance given by Henry to all his &s;ubjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy; and having obtained a cold or ambiguous permi&s;&s;ion, prepared him&s;elf for the execution of his de&s;igns. He fir&s;t &s;ent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights and &s;eventy archers, who landing near Waterford, defeated a body of three thou&s;and Iri&s;h, that had ventured to attack him<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Girald Camb p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>; and as Richard him&s;elf, who brought over two hundred hor&s;e, and an hundred archers, joined, in a few days after, the victo|rious Engli&s;h, they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Waterford, and proceeded to Dublin, which was taken by a&s;&s;ault. Roderic, in revenge, cut off the head of Dermot's &s;on, who had been left as a ho&s;tage in his hands; and Richard, mar|rying Eva, became &s;oon after, by the death of Dermot, ma&s;ter of the kingdom of Lein&s;ter, and prepared to extend his dominion over all Ireland.

He left mo&s;t of the Iri&s;h chieftains or princes in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their antient territories; be&s;towed &s;ome lands on the Engli&s;h adventurers; gave earl Richard the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ene&s;chal of Ireland; and after a &s;tay of a few months, returned in triumph into England. By the&s;e trivial exploits, &s;carce worth relating, except for the im|portance of the con&s;equences, was Ireland &s;ubdued, and annexed for ever to the Engli&s;h crown.</P>
<P>THE low &s;tate of commerce and indu&s;try, during tho&s;e ages, made it imprac|ticable for princes to &s;upport regular armies, which might retain the conquered countries in &s;ubjection; and the extreme barbari&s;m and poverty of Ireland could &s;till le&s;s afford means of bearing this expence. The only expedient by which a durable conque&s;t could then be made or maintained, was by pouring in a multi|tude of new inhabitants, dividing among them the lands of the vanqui&s;hed, e&s;ta|bli&s;hing them in all offices of tru&s;t and authority, and thereby transforming the antient inhabitants into a new people. By this policy, the northern invaders of old, and of late the duke of Normandy, had been able to fix their dominion, and to erect kingdoms, which remained &s;table on their foundations, and were tran&s;mitted to the po&s;terity of the fir&s;t conquerors. But the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Ire|land rendered that i&s;land &s;o little inviting to the Engli&s;h, that only a few of de&s;|perate fortunes could be per&s;uaded, from time to time, to tran&s;port them&s;elves into it<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1069.

and arbitrary powers on the leaders, who commanded a handful of men amid&s;t &s;uch ho&s;tile multitudes; and law and equity, in a little time, became as much unknown in the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements as they had ever been among the Iri&s;h tribes. Palatinates were erected in favour of the new adventurers; independant authority conferred; the natives, never fully &s;ubdued, &s;till retained their animo|&s;ities again&s;t the conquerors: Their hatred was retaliated by like injuries; and from the&s;e cau&s;es, the Iri&s;h, during the cour&s;e of four centuries, remained &s;till &s;avage and untractable; and it was not till the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, that the i&s;land was fully &s;ubdued; nor till that of her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that it gave hopes of becoming a u&s;eful conque&s;t to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>BESIDES that the ea&s;y and peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Iri&s;h left Henry no far|ther occupation in that i&s;land, he was recalled from it by another incident, which was of the la&s;t importance to his intere&s;ts and &s;afety. The two legates, Albert and Theodin, to whom was committed the trial of his conduct in the death of archbi&s;hop Becket, were arrived in Normandy; and being impatient of delay, &s;ent him frequent letters, full of menaces, if he protracted any longer the ma|king his appearance before them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gerald Camb. p. 778.</NOTE>. He ha&s;tened therefore to Normandy, and had a conference with them at Savigny, where their fir&s;t demands were &s;o exor|bitant, that he broke off the negotiation, threatened to return to Ireland, and bade them do their wor&s;t again&s;t him. They perceived, that the &s;ea&s;on was now pa&s;t for taking advantage of that tragical incident; which, had it been hotly pur&s;ued by interdicts and excommunications, was capable of throwing the whole kingdom into combu&s;tion. But the time, which Henry had happily gained, had contributed to appea&s;e the minds of men: The event could not now have the &s;ame influence, as when it was recent; and as the clergy had every day looked for an accommodation with the King, they had not oppo&s;ed the preten&s;ions of his partizans, who had been very indu&s;trious in repre&s;enting to the people his entire innocence in the murder of the primate, and his ignorance of the de&s;igns formed by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The legates, therefore, found them&s;elves obliged to lower their terms; and Henry was &s;o fortunate as to conclude an accommodation with them. He declared upon oath, before the reliques of the &s;aints, that &s;o far from commanding or de&s;iring the death of the archbi&s;hop, he was extremely grieved when he received intelligence of it: But as the pa&s;&s;ion which he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed on account of that prelate's conduct, had probably given occa&s;ion to his murder, he &s;tipulated the following conditions, as an atonement for the offence. He promi&s;ed, that he &s;hould pardon all &s;uch as had been bani&s;hed for their adhe|rence to Becker, and &s;hould re&s;tore them to their livings; that the &s;ee of Canter|bury
<PB N="305" REF="311"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's accommoda|tion with the court of Rome.</NOTE>
&s;hould be rein&s;tated in all its antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; that he &s;hould pay the tem|plars a &s;um of money &s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of two hundred knights during a year in the holy land; that he &s;hould him&s;elf take the cro&s;s at the Chri&s;tmas following, and, if the Pope in&s;i&s;ted on it, &s;erve three years again&s;t the infidels, either in Spain or in Pale&s;tine; that he &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t on the ob&s;ervance of &s;uch cu&s;toms, derogatory to eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, as had been introduced in his own time; and that he &s;hould not &s;top appeals to the Pope in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, but &s;hould content him&s;elf with exacting &s;ufficient &s;ecurity of the clergy, who left his dominions to pro&s;ecute an appeal, that they &s;hould attempt nothing again&s;t the rights of his crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 88. Benedict. Abb. p. 34. Hoveden, p. 529. Diceto, p. 560. Chron. Gerv. p. 1422.</NOTE>. Upon &s;igning the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, Henry received ab|&s;olution from the legates; was confirmed in the grant made by Pope Adrian of Ireland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1071.

He had always in&s;i&s;ted, that the laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Clarendon, contained not any new claims, but the antient cu&s;toms of the kingdom; and he was &s;till at liberty, notwith&s;tanding the articles of this agreement, to maintain his preten&s;ions. Ap|peals to the Pope were indeed permitted by this treaty; but as the King was al&s;o permitted to exact rea&s;onable &s;ecurities from the parties, and might &s;tretch his de|mands on this head as far as he plea&s;ed, he had it virtually in his power to pre|vent the Pope from reaping any advantage by this &s;eeming conce&s;&s;ion. And on the whole, the con&s;titutions of Clarendon remained &s;till the law of the realm; tho' the Pope and his legates &s;eem &s;o little to have conceived the King's power to lie under any legal limitations, that they were &s;atisfied with his departing, by treaty, from one of the mo&s;t momentous articles of the&s;e con&s;titutions, without requiring any repeal by the &s;tates of the kingdom.</P>
<P>HENRY, freed from this dangerous controver&s;y with the eccle&s;ia&s;tics and with the &s;ee of Rome, &s;eemed now to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur and felicity, and to be equally happy in his dome&s;tic &s;ituation and in his political government. A numerous progeny of &s;ons and daughters gave both lu&s;tre and authority to his crown, prevented the dangers of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and re|pre&s;&s;ed all preten&s;ions of the ambitious barons. The King's precaution al&s;o, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;everal branches of his family, &s;eemed well calculated to prevent all jealou&s;ies among the brothers, and to perpetuate the greatne&s;s of his family. He had ordered Henry, his elde&s;t &s;on, to be anointed King, and had de&s;tined him to be his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the kingdom of England, the dutchy of Normandy,

Richard, his &s;econd &s;on, was inve&s;ted in the dutchy of Guienne and county of Poictou; Geof|frey, his third &s;on, inherited, in right of his wife, the dutchy of Brittany; and his new conque&s;t of Ireland was de&s;tined for the appanage of John, his fourth &s;on. He had al&s;o negotiated, in favour of this la&s;t prince, a marriage with Ade|lais, the only daughter of Humbert, count of Savoy and Maurienne; and was to receive as her dowry very con&s;iderable deme&s;nes in Piedmont, Savoy, Bre&s;&s;e, and Dauphiny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 448.

<P>HENRY, agreeable to the promi&s;e which he had given both to the Pope and the French King, permitted his &s;on to be crowned anew by the hands of the archbi&s;hop of Ro&uuml;en, and a&s;&s;ociated the prince&s;s Margaret, &s;pou&s;e to young Henry, in this ceremony<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 529.

<P>THE partition of England into four divi&s;ions, and the appointment of itinerant ju&s;tices to go the circuit in each divi&s;ion, and decide the cau&s;es in the counties, was another important ordinance of this prince, had a direct tendency to re&s;train the oppre&s;&s;ions of the barons, and to protect the inferior gentry and common people in their property<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 590.</NOTE>.

Every man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a knight's fee, was ordained to have for each fee a coat of mail, a helmet, a &s;hield, and a lance; every free layman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of goods to the value of &s;ixteen marks, was to be armed in like manner; every one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten marks was obliged to have an iron gorget, a cap of iron, and a lance; all burge&s;&s;es were to have a cap of iron, a lance, and a wambais, that is, a coat twilted with wool, tow, or &s;uch other materials<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Bened.

<P>CARDINAL Albano, the Pope's legate, di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e increa&s;ing ob&s;tacles to the croi&s;ade, excommunicated Richa d, as the chief &s;pring of di&s;cord: But the &s;entence of excommunication, which, when it was properly prepared, and was zealou&s;ly &s;upported by the clergy, had often great influence in that age, proved entirely ineffectual in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The chief barons of Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being attached to the young prince, and &s;ee|ing that he had now received the inve&s;titure from their &s;uperior lord, declared for him, and made inroads into the territories of &s;uch as &s;till adhered to the old King.

But Philip, who was a prince of great vigour and capacity, de&s;pi&s;ed the menace; and told Anagni, that it belonged not to the Pope to interpo&s;e in the temporal di&s;|putes of princes, much le&s;s in tho&s;e between him and his rebellious va&s;&s;als.

As the King and Engli&s;h ba|rons were all of them of French extraction, the manners of that people ac|quired the a&s;cendant, and were regarded as the great models of imitation. All foreign improvements, therefore, &s;uch as they were, in literature and politene&s;s, in laws and arts, &s;eem now to have been, in a good mea&s;ure, tran&s;planted into England; and that nation was become nowi&s;e inferior, in all the fa&s;hionable ac|compli&s;hments, to any of its neighbours on the continent. The more homely,
<PB N="327" REF="333">
but more &s;en&s;ible manners and principles of the Saxons were exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the &s;ubtilties of &s;chool philo&s;ophy: The feudal ideas of civil government, the Romi&s;h &s;entiments of religion, had taken entire po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the people: By the former, the &s;en&s;e of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion towards princes was &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed in the barons; by the latter, the devoted attachment to papal authority was much augmented among the clergy. The Norman and other foreign families, e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, had now &s;truck deep root; and being entirely coalited with the people, whom at fir&s;t they oppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed, they no longer thought, that they needed the protection of the crown for the enjoy|ment of their fortunes, or con&s;idered their tenure as precarious and dependant. They a&s;pired to the &s;ame liberty and independance, which they &s;aw enjoyed by their brethren on the continent, and de&s;ired to re&s;train tho&s;e exorbitant prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the nece&s;&s;ities of war and the violence of conque&s;t had at fir&s;t obliged them to indulge in their monarch. That memory al&s;o of a more equal government under the Saxon princes, which &s;till remained with the Engli&s;h, diffu&s;ed &s;till farther the &s;pirit of liberty, and made the barons both de&s;irous of more independance to them&s;elves, and willing to indulge it to the people. And it was not long before this &s;ecret revolution in the &s;entiments of men produced fir&s;t violent convul&s;ions in the &s;tate, and then an evident alteration in the maxims of government.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of all the preceding Kings of England &s;ince the Conque&s;t, give evident proofs of the di&s;orders attending the feudal government; the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the barons, their &s;pirit of rebellion again&s;t the prince and laws, and of animo|&s;ity again&s;t each other: The conduct of the barons in the tran&s;marine dominions of tho&s;e monarchs afforded perhaps &s;till more flagrant in&s;tances of the&s;e convul&s;ions; and the hi&s;tory of France, during &s;everal ages, con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of narra|tions of this nature. The cities, during the continuance of this violent govern|ment, could neither be very populous nor numerous; and there occur in|&s;tances, which &s;eem to prove, that, tho' the&s;e are always the fir&s;t &s;eat of law and liberty, their police was in general very loo&s;e and irregular, and expo&s;ed to the &s;ame di&s;orders, with tho&s;e by which the country was generally infe&s;ted. It was a cu&s;tom in London for great numbers, to the amount of a hundred or more, of the &s;ons and relations of eminent citizens, to form them&s;elves into a li|centious confederacy, to break into rich hou&s;es and plunder them, to rob and murder the pa&s;&s;engers, and to commit with impunity all &s;orts of di&s;order. By the&s;e crimes, it had become &s;o dangerous to walk the &s;treets a-nights, that the citizens dared no more to venture abroad after &s;un&s;et, than if they were expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of a public enemy. The brother of the earl of Ferrars had been
<PB N="328" REF="334">
murdered by &s;ome of the&s;e nocturnal rioters; and the death of a per&s;on of that noble birth, which was much more regarded than that of many thou&s;ands of an inferior &s;tation, &s;o provoked the King, that he &s;wore vengeance again&s;t the crimi|nals, and became thenceforth much more rigorous in the execution of the laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 196.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another in&s;tance given by hi&s;torians, which proves to what a height &s;uch riots had proceeded, and how open the&s;e criminals were in committing their robberies. A band of them had attacked the hou&s;e of a rich citizen, with an intention of plundering it; had broke thro' a &s;tone-wall with hammers and wedges; and had already entered the hou&s;e &s;word in hand; when the citizen, armed cap-a-pee and &s;upported by his faithful &s;ervants, appeared in the pa&s;&s;age to oppo&s;e them: He cut off the right-hand of the fir&s;t robber that entered; and made &s;uch &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, that his neighbours had leizure to a&s;&s;emble, and come to his relief. The man, who lo&s;t his hand, was caught; and was tempted by the promi&s;e of pardon to reveal his confederates; among whom was one John Senex, e&s;teemed among the riche&s;t and be&s;t born citizens of London. He was convicted by the ordeal trial; and tho' he offered five hundred marks for his life, the King refu&s;ed the money, and ordered him to be hanged<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bened.

<P>HENRY's exactne&s;s in admini&s;tring ju&s;tice had gained him &s;o great reputation, that even foreign and di&s;tant princes made him an arbiter, and &s;ubmitted their differences to his judgment. Sanchez, King of Navarre, having &s;ome contro|ver&s;ies with Alfon&s;o, King of Ca&s;tile, was contented, tho' Alfon&s;o had married the daughter of Henry, to choo&s;e that prince for a referee; and they agreed, each of them, to con&s;ign three ca&s;tles into neutral hands, as a pledge of their not departing from his award. Henry made the cau&s;e be examined before his great council, and gave a &s;entence, which was willingly &s;ubmitted to by both parties. The&s;e two Spani&s;h Kings &s;ent each a &s;tout champion to the court of England, in order to defend his cau&s;e by arms, in ca&s;e the way of duel had been cho&s;en by Henry<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 4. p. 43.

<P>HENRY &s;o far aboli&s;hed the barbarous and ab&s;urd practice of forfeiting &s;hips, which had been wrecked on the coa&s;t, that if one man or animal was alive in the &s;hip, the ve&s;&s;el and goods were re&s;tored to the owners<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reign of Henry was remarkable for an innovation, which was afterwards carried farther by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and was attended with the mo&s;t important con|&s;equences to the government. This prince was di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;pecies of military force, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the feudal in&s;titutions, and which, tho' it
<PB N="329" REF="335">
was extremely burden&s;ome to the &s;ubject, yet rendered very little &s;ervice to the &s;overeign. The barons, or military tenants, came late into the field; they were obliged to &s;erve only for forty days; they were un&s;kilful and di&s;orderly in all their operations; and they were apt to carry into the camp the &s;ame refrac|tory and independant &s;pirit, to which they were accu&s;tomed in their civil govern|ment. Henry, therefore, introduced the practice of making a commutation of their military &s;ervice for money; and he levied &s;cutages from his baronies and knights fees, in&s;tead of requiring the per&s;onal attendance of his va&s;&s;als. There is mention made, in the hi&s;tory of the exchequer, of the&s;e &s;cutages in his &s;econd, fifth, and eighteenth year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 435, 436, 437, 438.</NOTE>; and other writers give us an account of three more of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. 2. p. 466. from the records.</NOTE>. When the prince had thus obtained money, he made a contract with &s;ome of tho&s;e adventurers, in which Europe at that time abound|ed: They found him &s;oldiers of the &s;ame character with them&s;elves, who were bound to &s;erve for a &s;tipulated time: The armies were much le&s;s numerous, but more u&s;eful, than when compo&s;ed of all the military va&s;&s;als of the crown: The feudal in&s;titutions began to relax: The Kings became rapacious for money, on which all their power depended: The barons, &s;eeing no end of exactions, &s;ought to defend their property: And as the &s;ame cau&s;es had nearly the &s;ame effect in the different countries of Europe, the &s;everal crowns either lo&s;t or acquired au|thority, according to their different &s;ucce&s;s in this &s;truggle.</P>
<P>THIS prince was al&s;o the fir&s;t who levied a tax on the moveables or per&s;onal e&s;tates of his &s;ubjects, nobles as well as people. Their zeal for the holy wars made them &s;ubmit to this innovation; and a precedent being once obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns, the u&s;ual method of &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;i|ties of the crown. The tax of Danegelt, &s;o generally odious to the nation, was remitted in this reign.</P>
<P>IT was an u&s;ual practice of the Kings of England, to repeat the ceremony of their coronation thrice a-year, on a&s;&s;embling the &s;tates at the three great fe&s;tivals. Henry, after the fir&s;t years of his reign, never renewed this ceremony, which was found to be very expen&s;ive and very u&s;ele&s;s. None of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ever re|vived it. It is deemed a great act of grace in this prince, that he mitigated the rigor of the fore&s;t-laws, and puni&s;hed any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of them, not capitally, but by fines, impri&s;onments, and other more moderate penalties.</P>
<P>SINCE we are here collecting &s;ome detached in&s;tances, which &s;how the genius of the age, and which could not &s;o well enter into the body of the hi&s;tory, it may not be ami&s;s to mention the quarrel between Roger archbi&s;hop of York, and
<PB N="330" REF="336">
Richard archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. We may judge of the violence of military men and laymen, when eccle&s;ia&s;tics could proceed to &s;uch extremities. Cardinal Haguezun being &s;ent, in 1176, as legate into Britain, &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of the clergy at London; and as both the archbi&s;hops pretended to &s;it on his right hand, this que&s;tion of precedency begot a controver&s;y between them. The monks and retainers of archbi&s;hop Richard fell upon Roger, in the pre&s;ence of the cardinal and of the &s;ynod, threw him on the ground, trampled him under foot, and &s;o brui&s;ed him with blows, that he was taken up half dead, and his life was, with difficulty, &s;aved from their violence.

<P><MILESTONE N="1189" UNIT="year"> THE compunction of Richard, for his undutiful behaviour towards his fa|ther, was very durable, and influenced him in the choice of his mini&s;ters and &s;ervants after his acce&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e who had &s;econded and favoured his re|bellion, in&s;tead of meeting with that honour and tru&s;t which they expected, were &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that they lay under di&s;grace with the new King, and were on all occa&s;ions hated and de&s;pi&s;ed by him. The faithful mini&s;ters of Henry, who had vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed all the enterprizes of his &s;ons, were received with open arms, and were continued in tho&s;e employments, which they had honourably di&s;|charged to their former ma&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 655.

This prudent conduct might be the re&s;ult of reflection; but in a prince, like Richard, &s;o much guided by pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o little by policy, it was commonly a&s;cribed to a principle &s;till more virtuous and more honourable.</P>
<P>RICHARD, that he might make atonement to one parent for his breach of duty to the other, immediately &s;ent orders for relea&s;ing the Queen-dowager from the confinement in which &s;he had been &s;o long detained<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ben.

appanage, which the late King had de&s;tined him, by other exten&s;ive grants and conce&s;&s;ions. He con&s;erred on him the whole e&s;tate of William Peverell, which had e&s;cheated to the crown: He put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eight ca&s;tles, with all the fore&s;ts and honours annexed to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

This zeal again&s;t infidels, being communicated to his &s;ubjects, broke out in London on the day of his coronation, and made them find a croi&s;ade le&s;s dan|gerous, and attended with more immediate profit. The prejudices of the age had made the lending of money on intere&s;t pa&s;s by the invidious name of u&s;ury; yet the nece&s;&s;ity of the practice had &s;till continued it, and the greate&s;t part of that kind of dealing fell every where into the hands of the Jews; who, being already infamous on account of their religion, had no honour to lo&s;e, and were apt to exerci&s;e a profe&s;&s;ion, odious in it&s;elf, by every kind of rigor, and even &s;ome|times by rapine and extortion. The indu&s;try and frugality of that people had put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the ready money, which the idlene&s;s and profu&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, as well as of other European nations, enabled them to lend on exorbitant and unequal intere&s;t. The monki&s;h writers repre&s;ent it as a great &s;tain on the wi&s;e and equitable government of Henry, that he had carefully protected this infidel race from all injuries and in&s;ults; but the zeal of Richard afforded the populace a pretence for exerci&s;ing their animo&s;ity again&s;t them.

<P>THE antient &s;ituation of England, when the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little riches and the public no credit, made it impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;overeigns to bear the expences of a &s;teady or durable war, even on their frontiers; much le&s;s could they find regu|lar means for the &s;upport of &s;uch di&s;tant expeditions as tho&s;e into Pale&s;tine, which were more the re&s;ult of popular frenzy than of &s;ober rea&s;on or deliberate policy.

<P>RICHARD and Philip were, by the &s;ituation and extent of their dominions, rivals in power; by their age and inclinations, competitors for glory; and the&s;e cau&s;es of emulation, which, had the princes been employed in the field again&s;t the common enemy, might have &s;timulated them to martial enterprizes, &s;oon excited, during the pre&s;ent lei&s;ure and repo&s;e, quarrels between monarchs of &s;uch a fiery character. Equally haughty, ambitious, intrepid, and inflexible; they were irritated with the lea&s;t appearance of injury, and were incapable, by mutual conde&s;cen&s;ions, to efface tho&s;e cau&s;es of complaint, which unavoidably aro&s;e be|tween them. Richard, candid, &s;incere, unde&s;igning, impolitic, violent, laid him&s;elf open, on every occa&s;ion, to the de&s;igns of his antagoni&s;t; who, provi|dent, intere&s;ted, deceitful, failed not to take all advantages again&s;t him: And thus, both the circum&s;tances of their di&s;po&s;ition in which they were &s;imilar, and tho&s;e in which they differed, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to per&s;evere in that harmony, which was &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of their enterprize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;actions in Sicily.</NOTE> THE la&s;t King of Sicily and Naples was William II. who had married Joan, &s;i&s;ter to Richard, and who, dying without i&s;&s;ue, had bequeathed his dominions to his paternal aunt, Con&s;tantia, the only legitimate offspring &s;urviving of Roger, the fir&s;t &s;overeign of tho&s;e &s;tates who had been honoured with the royal title.

BUT Richard's heroic actions in Pale&s;tine were the be&s;t apology for his con|duct.

A&s;calon &s;oon after fell into the hands of the Chri&s;tians: Other &s;ieges were carried on with &s;ucce&s;s: Richard was even able to advance within &s;ight of Jeru&s;alem, the object of all his enterprizes; when he had the mortification to find, that he mu&s;t abandon all hopes of immediate &s;uc|ce&s;s, and mu&s;t put a &s;top to his career of victory. The croi&s;es, animated with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor for the holy wars, broke at fir&s;t thro' all regards to &s;afety or intere&s;t in the pro&s;ecution of their purpo&s;e; and tru&s;ting to the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven, &s;et nothing before their eyes but fame and victory in this world, and a crown of glory in the next. But long ab&s;ence from home, fatigue, di&s;ea&s;e, want, and the varieties of &s;ucce&s;s which naturally attend war, had gra|dually abated that fury, which nothing was able directly to with&s;tand; and every one, except the King of England, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;peedily returning into Europe. The Germans and the Italians declared their re&s;olution of de&s;i&s;ting from the enterprize: The French were &s;till more ob&s;tinate in this purpo&s;e: The duke of Burgundy, in order to pay court to Philip, took all opportunities of mortifying and oppo&s;ing Richard<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>: And there appeared an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of abandoning for the pre&s;ent all hopes of farther conque&s;t, and of &s;ecuring the acqui&s;itions of the Chri&s;tians by an accommodation with Saladin. Richard, therefore, concluded a truce with that monarch; and &s;tipulated, that Acre, Joppa, and other &s;eaport towns of Pale&s;tine, &s;hould remain in the hands of the croi&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that all Chri&s;tians &s;hould have liberty to perform their pilgrimage

<P>THE liberty in which Saladin indulged the Chri&s;tians, to perform their pilgri|mages to Jeru&s;alem, was an ea&s;y &s;acrifice on his part; and the furious wars, which he waged in defence of the barren territory of Judea, were not with him, as with the croi&s;es, the re&s;ult of &s;uper&s;tition, but of policy.

Richard, equally martial and brave, carried with him more of the barbarian character; and was guilty of acts of ferocity, which throw a &s;tain on his celebrated victories. When Saladin refu&s;ed to ratify the ca|pitulation of Acre, the King of England ordered all his pri&s;oners, to the number of five thou&s;and, to be butchered; and the Saracens found them&s;elves obliged to retaliate upon the Chri&s;tians by a like cruelty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 607.

<P><MILESTONE N="1199" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acce&s;&s;ion of the King.</NOTE> THE noble and free genius of the antients, which made the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on be always regarded by them as a &s;pecies of tyranny and u&s;ur|pation, and kept them from forming any conception of a legal and regular monar|chy, had rendered them entirely ignorant both of the rights of <HI>primogeniture</HI> and a <HI>repre&s;entation</HI> in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; inventions &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve order in the lines of princes, to obviate the evils of civil di&s;cord and of u&s;urpation, and to beget mo|deration in that &s;pecies of government, by giving &s;ecurity to the ruling &s;overeign. The&s;e innovations aro&s;e from the feudal law; which, fir&s;t introducing the right of primogeniture, made &s;uch a di&s;tinction between the families of the elder and younger brothers, that the &s;on of the former was thought intitled to &s;ucceed to his grandfather, preferably to his uncles, tho' nearer allied to the decea&s;ed monarch. But tho' this progre&s;s of ideas was natural, it was gradual. In the age of which we treat, the practice of repre&s;entation was indeed introduced, but not thorough|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the minds of men floated between oppo&s;ite principles. Ri|chard, when he entered on the holy war, declared his nephew, Arthur duke of Brittany, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and by a formal deed, he &s;et a&s;ide, in his favour, the title of his brother John, who was younger than Geoffrey, the father of that prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden. p. 677.

would maintain his right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and Richard, on his return, to k no &s;teps towards re&s;toring or &s;ecuring the order which he had at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. He was even careful, by his la&s;t will, to declare his brother John heir to all his dominions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Trivet, p. 138.</NOTE>; whether, that he now thought Arthur, who was only twelve years of age, incapable of a&s;&s;erting his claim again&s;t John's faction, or was influ|enced by Eleanor, the Queen-mother, who hated Con&s;tantia, mother to the young duke, and who dreaded the influence which that prince&s;s would naturally acquire during the reign of her &s;on. The authority of a te&s;tament was great in that age, even where the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a kingdom was concerned; and John had rea&s;on to hope, that this title, joined to his plau&s;ible right in other re&s;pects, would en&s;ure him the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But the idea of repre&s;entation &s;eems to have made, at this time, greater progre&s;s in France than in England; and the barons of the tran&s;marine provinces, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, immediately decla|red in favour of Arthur's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 792.

Philip, who de&s;ired only an occa&s;ion to em|bara&s;s John, and di&s;member his dominions, embraced the cau&s;e of the young duke of Brittany, took him under his protection, and &s;ent him to Paris to be edu|cated, along with his &s;on Lewis<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

Hubert, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, William Mare&s;chal, earl of Strigul, &s;oon after created earl of Pembroke, and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the ju&s;ticiary, the three mo&s;t favoured mini&s;ters of the late King, were already engaged on his &s;ide<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 793.

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> THE King of France, who&s;e ambitious and active &s;pirit had been hitherto con|fined, either by the &s;ound policy of Henry, or the martial genius of Richard, &s;eeing now the opportunity favourable again&s;t this ba&s;e and odious prince, em|braced the project of expelling the Engli&s;h, or rather the Engli&s;h King, from France, and of annexing to the crown &s;o many con&s;iderable fiefs, which, during &s;everal ages, had been di&s;membered from it. Many of the other great va&s;&s;als, who&s;e jealou&s;y might have interpo&s;ed, and have ob&s;tructed the execution of this project, were not at pre&s;ent in a &s;ituation to oppo&s;e it; and the re&s;t either looked on with indifference, or gave their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to this dangerous aggrandizement of their &s;uperior lord. The earls of Handers and Blois were engaged in the holy war: The count of Champagne was an in&s;ant, and under the guardian&s;hip of Philip: The dutchy of Brittany, enraged at the murder of their prince, vigo|rou&s;ly promoted all his mea&s;ures: And the general defection of John's va&s;&s;als made every enterprize ea&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t him. Philip, after taking &s;eve|ral ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es beyond the Loire, which he either garri&s;oned or di&s;man|tled, received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of the count of Alen&ccedil;on, who de&s;erted John, and delivered up all the places under his command to the French King: Upon which, Philip &s;eparated his army, in order to give them &s;ome repo&s;e after the fatigues of the campaign. John, &s;uddenly collecting &s;ome troops, laid &s;iege to Alen&ccedil;on; and Philip, who&s;e di&s;per&s;ed army could not be brought together in time to &s;uccour it, &s;aw him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the di&s;grace of &s;uffering the oppre&s;&s;ion of his friend and confederate. But his active and fertile genius found an expedient again&s;t this evil. There was held at that very time a tournament at Moret in the Gatinois; whither all the chief nobility of France and the neighbouring countries had re&s;orted, in order to &s;ignalize their courage and addre&s;s. Philip pre&s;ented him&s;elf before them; craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his di&s;tre&s;s; and pointed out the plains of Alen|&ccedil;on as the mo&s;t honourable field, in which they could di&s;play their genero&s;ity and martial &s;pirit. The&s;e valorous knights vowed, that they would take vengeance on the ba&s;e parricide, the &s;tain of arms and of chivalry; and putting them&s;elves, with all their retinue, under the command of Philip, in&s;tantly marched to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Alen&ccedil;on. John, hearing of their approach, fled from before the place; and in the hurry abandoned all his tents, machines, and baggage, to the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS feeble effort was the la&s;t exploit of that &s;lothful and cowardly prince for the defence of his dominions. He thenceforth remained in total inactivity at Ro&uuml;en; and pa&s;&s;ed all his time, with his young wife, in pa&s;times and amu&s;e|ments, as if his &s;tate had been in the mo&s;t profound tranquillity, or his affairs in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous condition. If he ever mentioned war, it was only to give

No one thought of defending a man, who &s;eemed to have de&s;erted him&s;elf; and his &s;ubjects looked on his fate with the &s;ame indif|ference, to which, in this pre&s;&s;ing exigency, they &s;aw him totally abandoned.</P>
<P>JOHN, while he neglected all dome&s;tic re&s;ources for his &s;afety, had the mean|ne&s;s to betake him&s;elf to a foreign power, who&s;e protection he claimed: He ap|plied to the Pope, Innocent III. and entreated him to interpo&s;e with his autho|rity between him and the French monarch. Innocent, plea&s;ed with any occa&s;ion of exerting his &s;uperiority, &s;ent Philip orders to &s;top the progre&s;s of his arms, and to make peace with the King of England. But the French barons received this me&s;&s;age with indignation; di&s;claimed the temporal authority challenged by the pontiff; and vowed, that they would, to the uttermo&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;t their prince again&s;t all his enemies: And Philip, &s;econding their ardour, proceeded, in&s;tead of obey|ing the Pope's envoys, to lay &s;iege to Chateau Gaillard, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fortre&s;s which remained to guard the frontiers of Normandy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1204" UNIT="year"> CHATEAU GAILLARD was &s;ituated partly on an i&s;land in the river Seine, partly on a rock oppo&s;ite to it; and was &s;ecured by every advantage, which either art or nature could be&s;tow upon it. The late King, having ca&s;t his eye on this fa|vourable &s;ituation, had &s;pared no labour nor expence in fortifying it; and it was defended by Roger de Laci, con&s;table of Che&s;ter, a determined officer, at the head of a numerous garri&s;on. Philip, who de&s;paired of taking the place by force, propo&s;ed to &s;ubdue it by famine; and that he might cut off its communication with the neighbouring country, he threw a bridge acro&s;s the Seine, while he him&s;elf with his army blockaded it by land. The earl of Pembroke, the man of greate&s;t vigour and capacity in the Engli&s;h court, formed a plan for breaking thro' the French entrenchments, and throwing relief into the place. He carried with him an army of 4000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, and &s;uddenly attacked, with great &s;ucce&s;s, Philip's camp in the night time; having left orders, that a fleet of &s;eventy flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els &s;hould &s;ail up the Seine, and fall at the &s;ame

in&s;tant on the bridge. <MILESTONE N="1205" UNIT="year"> But the wind and the current of the river, by retarding the ve&s;&s;els, di&s;concerted this plan of operations; and it was morning before the fleet appeared; when Pembroke, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful in the beginning of the action, was already repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and the French King had leizure to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the&s;e new a&s;&s;ailants, who were repul&s;ed in their turn. After this misfortune, John made no farther efforts for the relief of Chateau Gaillard; and Philip had all the leizure requi&s;ite for conducting and fini&s;hing the &s;iege. Roger de Laci defended him&s;elf for a twelvemonth with great ob&s;tinacy; and having bravely repul&s;ed every attack, and patiently born all the hard&s;hips of fa|mine, he was at la&s;t overpowered by a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault in the night-time, and made pri&s;oner of war, with his whole garri&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 144. Gul. Britto, lib. 7. Ann. Waverl. p. 168.</NOTE>. Philip, who knew how to re&s;pect valor even in an enemy, treated him with the utmo&s;t civility; and gave him the whole city of Paris for the place of his confinement.</P>
<P>WHEN this balwark of Normandy was once &s;ubdued, all the province lay open to the inroads of Philip; and the King of England de&s;paired of being any longer able to defend it. He &s;ecretly prepared ve&s;&s;els for a &s;candalous flight; and that the Normans might no longer doubt of his re&s;olution to abandon them, he or|dered the fortifications of Pont de l'Arche, Moulineaux, and l' Am|auri to be demoli&s;hed. Not daring to repo&s;e confidence in any of his Barons, whom he believed to be univer&s;ally engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, he en|tru&s;ted the government of the province to Archas Martin and Lupicaire, two mercenary Braban&ccedil;ons, whom he had retained in his &s;ervice. Philip, now &s;ecure of his prey, pu&s;hed his conque&s;ts with vigor and &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the di&s;mayed Normans. Falai&s;e was fir&s;t be&s;ieged; and Lupicaire, who commanded in this impregnable fortre&s;s, after &s;urrendering the place, ba&s;ely inli&s;ted him&s;elf with his troops in the &s;ervice of Philip, and carried on ho&s;tilities again&s;t his antient ma&s;ter. Caen, Cautance, Seez, Evreux, Ba&iuml;eux &s;oon fell into the hands of the French mo|narch, and all the lower Normandy was reduced under his dominion. To for|ward his enterprizes on the other divi&s;ion of the province, Gui de Thouars, at the head of the Bretons, broke into the territory, and took Mount St. Michael, Avranches, and all the other fortre&s;&s;es in that neighbourhood. The Normans, who abhorred the French yoke, and who would have defended them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity, if their prince had appeared to conduct them, found no re&s;ource but in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and every city opened its gates, as &s;oon as Philip appeared before it. Ro&uuml;en alone, Arques and Verne&uuml;il determined to maintain their li|berties; and formed a confederacy together for mutual defence. Philip began with the attack of Ro&uuml;en; and the inhabitants were &s;o inflamed with hatred to

France, that, on the appearance of his army, they fell on all the natives of that country, whom they found within their walls, and put them to death. But after the French King had begun his operations with &s;ucce&s;s, and had taken &s;ome of their outworks, the citizens, &s;eeing no re&s;ource, offered to capitulate; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> June</NOTE> and demanded only thirty days to adverti&s;e their prince of their danger, and to require &s;uccours again&s;t the enemy. Upon the expiration of the term, as no &s;upply had arrived, they opened their gates to Philip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 147. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 459.</NOTE>; and the whole province &s;oon after imitated their example, and &s;ubmitted to the victor. Thus was this important territory reunited to the crown of France, near three centuries after the ce&s;&s;ion of it by Charles the Simple to Rollo, the fir&s;t duke: And the Nor|mans, &s;en&s;ible that this conque&s;t was probably final, demanded the privilege of being governed by French laws; which Philip, making a few alterations on the ancient Norman cu&s;toms, readily granted them. But the French monarch had too much ambition and genius to &s;top in his pre&s;ent career of &s;ucce&s;s. He carried his victorious army into the we&s;tern provinces; &s;oon reduced Anjou, Maine, Tou|raine, and part of Poictou under his dominion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 149.</NOTE>; and in this manner, the French crown, during the reign of one able and active prince, received &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of power and grandeur, as, in the ordinary cour&s;e of things, would have required it &s;everal ages to acquire.</P>
<P>JOHN, on his arrival in England, that he might cover the di&s;grace of his own conduct, exclaimed loudly again&s;t his barons, who, he pretended, had de&s;erted his &s;tandard in Normandy; and he arbitrarily extorted from them a &s;eventh part of all their moveables, as a puni&s;hment for this offence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, 146. M. We&s;t. p. 265.</NOTE>. Soon after he forced them to grant him a &s;cutage of two marks and a half on each knight's fee for an expedition into Normandy; but he did not attempt to execute the &s;ervice, for which he pretended to exact it. Next year, he &s;ummoned all the barons of his realm to attend him on this foreign expedition, and collected the &s;hips from all the &s;ea-ports; but meeting with oppo&s;ition from &s;ome of his mini&s;ters, and re|penting him of his de&s;ign, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed both fleet and army, and then renewed his exclamations again&s;t the barons for de&s;erting him. He next put to &s;ea with a &s;mall army, and his &s;ubjects believed, that he was re&s;olved to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t hazards for the defence and recovery of his dominions: But they were &s;urprized, after a few days, to &s;ee him return again into harbour, without attempting any thing. In the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ea&s;on, he had the courage to carry his ho&s;tile mea&s;ures a &s;tep farther. <MILESTONE N="1206" UNIT="year"> Gui de Tho&uuml;ars, who governed Brittany, being jealous of the rapid progre&s;s, made by his ally, the French King, promi&s;ed to

But the approach of Philip with an army threw him into terrors; and he immediately made propo&s;als of peace, and fixed a place of interview with his enemy: But in&s;tead of keeping this engagement, he &s;tole off with his army, embarked at Rochelle, and returned, loaded with new &s;hame and di&s;grace, into England.

<P>IN an age, when per&s;onal valor was regarded as the chief accompli&s;hment, &s;uch conduct as that of John, di&s;graceful at any time, mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to pecu|liar contempt; and he could thenceforth expect to rule his turbulent va&s;&s;a's with a very doubtful authority. But the government, exerci&s;ed by the Norman princes, had wound up the royal ower to &s;o high a pitch, and &s;o much beyond the u&s;ual tenor of the feudal con&s;titutions, that it behoved him to be deba&s;ed by new af|fronts and di&s;graces, ere his barons could entertain the views of con&s;piring again&s;t him, in order to retrench his exorbitant prerogatives. The church, which, at that time, declined not a conte&s;t with the mo&s;t powerful and vigorous monarchs, took fir&s;t advantage of John's imbecillity; and with the mo&s;t aggravating cir|cum&s;tances of in&s;olence and &s;corn, fixed her yoke upon him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> THE papal chair was then filled by Innocent III. who, having attained that dignity at the age of thirty-&s;even years, and being endowed with a lo&s;ty and en|terprizing genius, gave full &s;cope to his ambition, and attempted, perhaps more openly than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, to convert that &s;uperiority, which was yielded him by all the European princes, into a real dominion over them. The hierarchy, protected by the Roman pontiff, had already carried to an enormous height its u&s;urpations upon the civil power; but in order to extend them farther, and ren|der them u&s;eful to the court of Rome, it was nece&s;&s;ary to reduce the eccle&s;ia&s;tics them&s;elves under an ab&s;olute monarchy, and to make them entirely dependant on their &s;piritual leader.

the King, to obviate all conte&s;ts, endeavoured to per&s;uade the &s;uffragan bi&s;hops not to in&s;i&s;t on their right of concurring in the election: But the&s;e prelates, per|&s;evering in their preten&s;ions, &s;ent an agent to maintain their cau&s;e before Inno|cent; while the King, and the convent of Chri&s;t church, di&s;patched twelve monks of that order to &s;upport, before the &s;ame tribunal, the election of the bi&s;hop of Norwich.</P>
<P>THUS, there lay three different claims before the Pope, whom all parties allowed to be the &s;upreme arbiter of the conte&s;t. The claim of the &s;uffragans, being &s;o oppo&s;ite to the u&s;ual maxims of the papal court, was &s;oon &s;et a&s;ide: The election of Reginald was &s;o obviou&s;ly fraudulent and irregular, that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of defending it: But Innocent maintained, that, tho' this elec|tion was null and invalid, it ought previou&s;ly to have been declared &s;uch by the &s;overeign pontiff, before the monks could proceed to a new election; and that the choice of the bi&s;hop of Norwich was of cour&s;e as uncanonical as that of his competitor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 155. Chron. de Mailr. p. 182.</NOTE>. Advantage was, therefore, taken of this &s;ubtlety for introducing a precedent, by which the &s;ee of Canterbury, the mo&s;t important dignity in the church after the papal throne, &s;hould be ever after at the di&s;po&s;al of the court of Rome.</P>
<P>WHILE the Pope maintained &s;o many fierce conte&s;ts, in order to wre&s;t from princes the right of granting inve&s;titures, and to exclude laymen from all autho|rity of conferring eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, he was &s;upported by the united influence of the clergy, who, a&s;piring to independance, fought, with all the ardour of ambition, and all the zeal of &s;uper&s;tition, under his &s;acred banners. But no &s;ooner was this point, after a great effu&s;ion of blood and the convul&s;ions of many &s;tates, e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome tolerable degree, than the victorious leader, as is u&s;ual, turned his arms again&s;t his own community, and a&s;pired to center all power in his per&s;on. By the invention of re&s;erves, provi&s;ions, commendams, and other devices, the Pope gradually a&s;&s;umed the right of filling vacant benefices; and the plenitude of his apo&s;tolic power, which was not &s;ubjected to any limitations, &s;upplied all defects of title in the per&s;on on whom he be&s;towed preferment. The canons which regulated elections were purpo&s;ely rendered intricate and involved: Frequent di&s;putes aro&s;e among candidates: Appeals were every day carried to Rome: The apo&s;tolic &s;ee, be&s;ides reaping pecuniary advantages from the&s;e con|te&s;ts, often exerci&s;ed the power of &s;etting a&s;ide both the litigants, and on pre|tence of appea&s;ing faction, nominated a third per&s;on, who might be more accep|table to the contending parties.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> THE &s;entence of interdict was at that time the great in&s;trument of vengeance and policy employed by the court of Rome; was pronounced again&s;t &s;overeigns for the lighte&s;t offences; and made the guilt of one per&s;on involve the ruin of millions, even in their &s;piritual and eternal welfare. The execution of it was artificially calculated to &s;trike the &s;en&s;es in the highe&s;t degree, and to operate with irre&s;i&s;tible force on the &s;uper&s;titious minds of the people. The nation was of a &s;udden deprived of all exterior exerci&s;e of its religion: The altars were de&s;poiled of their ornaments: The cro&s;&s;es, the reliques, the images, the &s;tatues of the &s;aints were laid on the ground; and as if the air it&s;elf were profaned, and might pollute them by its contact, the prie&s;ts carefully covered them up, even from their own approach and veneration. The u&s;e of bells entirely cea&s;ed in all the churches: The bells them&s;elves were removed from the &s;teeples, and laid on the ground with the other &s;acred uten&s;ils. Ma&s;s was celebrated with &s;hut doors; and none but the prie&s;ts were admitted to that holy in&s;titution. The laity partook of no religious rite, except bapti&s;m to new-born infants, and the communion to the dying: The dead were not interred in con&s;ecrated ground: They were thrown into ditches, or buried in common fields; and their ob&s;equies were not attended with prayers or any hallowed ceremony. Marriage was celebrated in the church|yards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

Every circum&s;tance carried the &s;ymptoms of the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and of the mo&s;t immediate apprehen&s;ions of divine vengeance and indignation.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might oppo&s;e <HI>his</HI> temporal to <HI>their</HI> &s;piritual terrors, im|mediately, from his own authority, confi&s;cated the e&s;tates of all the clergy who obeyed the interdict<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ann.

He treated with the utmo&s;t rigour all Langton's adherents, and every one that &s;howed any di&s;po&s;ition to obey the orders of Rome: And that he might di&s;tre&s;s the clergy in the tendere&s;t point, and at the &s;ame time expo&s;e them to reproach and ridicule, he threw into pri&s;on all their concubines, and required high fines and confi&s;cations as the price of their liberty<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

the eccle&s;ia&s;tics gave, almo&s;t univer&s;ally and avowedly, into the u&s;e of concu|binage; and the court of Rome, which had no intere&s;t in prohibiting this prac|tice, made a very &s;light oppo&s;ition to it. The cu&s;tom was become &s;o prevalent, that &s;ome German &s;ynods, before the reformation, not only permitted, but, to avoid &s;candal, enjoined the u&s;e of concubines to the younger clergy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo, Hi&s;t.

The bi&s;hop commonly took care to pre|vent this practice from degenerating into licentiou&s;ne&s;s: He confined the prie&s;t to the u&s;e of one woman, required him to be con&s;tant to her bed, obliged him to provide for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and that of her children; and, tho' the offspring was, in the eye of the law, deemed illegitimate, this commerce was really a kind of inferior marriage, &s;uch as is &s;till practi&s;ed in Germany among the nobles; and may be regarded by the candid as an appeal, from the tyranny of civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical in&s;titutions, to the more virtuous and more unerring laws of nature.</P>
<P>THE quarrel between the King and the &s;ee of Rome continued for &s;ome years; and tho' many of the clergy, from the fear of puni&s;hment, obeyed the orders of John, and celebrated divine &s;ervice, they complied with the utmo&s;t reluctance, and were regarded, both by them&s;elves and the people, as men who betrayed their principles, and &s;acrificed their con&s;cience to temporal regards and intere&s;ts. During this violent &s;ituation, the King, in order to give a lu&s;tre to his govern|ment, attempted military expeditions, again&s;t Scotland, again&s;t Ireland, again&s;t the Wel&s;h<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P><MILESTONE N="1209" UNIT="year"> THE church of Rome had artificially contrived a gradation of &s;entences; by which &s;he kept offenders in awe; &s;till afforded them an opportunity of preventing the next anathema by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and in ca&s;e of their ob&s;tinacy, was able to re|fre&s;h the horror of the people again&s;t them, by new denunciations of the wrath and vengeance of heaven. As the &s;entence of interdict had not operated the de|&s;ired effect on John, and as his people, tho' extremely di&s;contented, had hitherto been re&s;trained from ri&s;ing into open rebellion again&s;t him, he was &s;oon to look for the &s;entence of excommunication: And he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that, notwith&s;tanding all his precautions, the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences might en&s;ue from it.

Philip was in a rage on receiving this intelligence: He exclaimed, that having, at the Pope's in&s;tigation, undertaken an expedition, which had co&s;t him above 60,000 pounds Sterling, he was fru&s;trated of his pur|po&s;e, at the time when its &s;ucce&s;s was become infallible: He complained, that all the expence had fallen upon him; all the advantage had accrued to Innocent. He threatened to be no longer the dupe of the&s;e hypocritical pretences: And a&s;|&s;embling his va&s;&s;als, he laid before them the ill treatment which he had received, expo&s;ed the intere&s;ted and fraudulent conduct of the Pope, and required their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to execute his enterprize again&s;t England, in which, he told them, that, notwith&s;tanding the inhibitions and menaces of the legate, he was determined to per&s;evere.

<P>JOHN, exulting in his pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, in&s;en&s;ible to his pa&s;t di&s;grace, was &s;o elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, that he thought of no le&s;s than of invading France in his turn, and of recovering all tho&s;e provinces which the pro&s;perous arms of Philip had formerly ravi&s;hed from him. He propo&s;ed this expedition to the barons, who were already a&s;&s;embled for the defence of the kingdom. But the Engli&s;h barons both hated and de&s;pi&s;ed their prince: They progno&s;ticated no &s;ucce&s;s to any en|terprize conducted by &s;uch a leader: And pretending, that their time of &s;ervice was elap&s;ed, and all their provi&s;ions exhau&s;ted, they refu&s;ed to &s;econd his under|taking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

John could therefore think henceforth of nothing farther, than of ruling peaceably his own kingdom; and his clo&s;e conjunction with the Pope, which he was deter|mined at any price to maintain, en&s;ured him, as he imagined, the certain attain|ment of this object.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the barons.</NOTE> THE introduction of the feudal law into England by William the Conqueror had much infringed the liberties, however imperfect, enjoyed by the Anglo-Saxons in their antient government, and had reduced the whole people to a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage under the King or barons, and even the greate&s;t part of them to a real &s;tate of &s;lavery. The nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o of devolving great power into the hands of a prince, who was to maintain a military dominion over a vanqui&s;hed nation, had engaged the Norman barons to &s;ubmit to a more rigorous and ab&s;olute au|thority, than that to which men of their rank, in other feudal governments, were

commonly &s;ubjected. The prerogatives of the crown, once rai&s;ed to a high pitch, were not ea&s;ily reduced; and the nation, during the cour&s;e of an hundred and fifty years, had groaned under a tyranny, unknown to all the kingdoms founded by the northern conquerors. Henry I. that he might allure the people to give an exclu&s;ion to his elder brother Robert, had granted them a charter, favourable in many particulars to their liberties; Stephen had renewed this grant; Henry II. had confirmed it: But the conce&s;&s;ions of all the&s;e princes had &s;till remained with|out effect; and the &s;ame unlimited, at lea&s;t irregular authority, continued to be exerci&s;ed both by them and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The only happine&s;s was, that arms were never yet ravi&s;hed from the hands of the barons and people: The nation, by a great confederacy, might &s;till vindicate its liberties: And nothing was more likely, than the character, conduct, and fortunes of the pre&s;ent &s;overeign, to produce &s;uch a general union and combination again&s;t him Equally odious and contemptible, both in public and private life, he affronted the barons by his in|&s;olence, di&s;honoured their families by his gallantries, enraged them by his tyran|ny, and gave di&s;content to all ranks of men by his endle&s;s exactions and impo&s;i|tions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

very powerful cau&s;es to loo&s;en their devoted attachment to the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. It appeared from all the late u&s;urpations of the Roman pontiff, that he pretended to reap alone all the advantages accruing from that victory, which, under his banners, tho' at their own hazard, they had every where obtained over the civil magi&s;trate. The Pope a&s;&s;umed a de&s;potic power over all the churches: Their particular cu&s;toms, privileges, and immunities, were treated with di&s;dain: Even the canons of general councils were &s;et a&s;ide by his di&s;pen&s;ing power: The whole admini&s;tration of the church was centered in the court of Rome: All preferments ran of cour&s;e in the &s;ame channel: And the provincial clergy &s;aw, at lea&s;t felt, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of limiting the&s;e exorbitant preten&s;ions. The legate, Nicholas, in filling tho&s;e numerous vacancies which had fallen in England dur|ing an interdict of &s;ix years, had proceeded in the mo&s;t arbitrary manner; and had paid no regard, in conferring dignities, to per&s;onal merit, to rank, to the inclination of the electors, or to the cu&s;toms of the country. The Engli&s;h church was univer&s;ally di&s;gu&s;ted; and Langton him&s;elf, tho' he owed his eleva|tion to an incroachment of the Romi&s;h &s;ee, was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in his high office, than he became jealous of the privileges annexed to it, and formed attach|ments with the country &s;ubjected to his juri&s;diction.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magna Char|ta. 15th June.</NOTE> A CONFERENCE between the King and the barons was appointed at Runnemede, between Wind&s;or and Staines; a place which has ever &s;ince been extremely cele|brated, on account of this great event. The two parties encamped apart, like open enemies; and after a debate of a few days, the King, with a facility which was &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, &s;igned and &s;ealed the charter which was required of him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June.</NOTE> This famous deed, commonly called the GREAT CHARTER, either grant|ed or &s;ecured very important liberties and privileges to every order of men in the kingdom, to the clergy, to the barons, and to the people.</P>
<P>THE freedom of elections was &s;ecured to the clergy: The former charter of the King was confirmed, by which the nece&s;&s;ity of a royal cong&eacute; d'elire and con|firmation was &s;uper&s;eded: All check upon appeals to Rome was removed, by the allowance granted every man to depart the kingdom at plea&s;ure: And the fines upon the clergy, for any offence, were ordained to be proportional to their lay e&s;tates, not to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices.</P>
<P>THE privileges granted to the barons were either abatements in the rigors of the feudal law, or determinations in points which had been left by that law, or
<PB N="387" REF="393">
had become by practice, arbitrary and ambiguous. The reliefs of heirs &s;ucceeding to a military fee were a&s;certained; an earl's at an hundred pounds, a baron's at an hundred marks, a knight's at an hundred &s;hillings. It was ordained by the char|ter, that, if the heir be a minor, he &s;hall, immediately upon his majority, enter upon his e&s;tate, without paying any relief: The King &s;hall not &s;ell his ward&s;hip: He &s;hall levy only rea&s;onable profits upon the e&s;tate, without committing wa&s;te or hurting the property: He &s;hall uphold the ca&s;tles, hou&s;es, mills, parks and ponds: And if he commit the guardian&s;hip of the e&s;tate to the &s;heriff or any other, he &s;hall previou&s;ly oblige them to find &s;urety to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Dur|ing the minority of a baron, while his lands are in ward&s;hip, and are not in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, no debt which he owes to the Jews &s;hall bear any intere&s;t. Heirs &s;hall be married without di&s;paragement; and before the marriage be contracted, the neare&s;t relations of the per&s;ons &s;hall be informed of it. A widow, without paying any relief, &s;hall enter upon her dower, the third part of her hu&s;band's rents: She &s;hall not be compelled to marry, &s;o long as &s;he chu&s;es to continue &s;ingle; &s;he &s;hall only give &s;ecurity never to marry without her lord's con&s;ent. The King &s;hall not claim the ward&s;hip of any minor, who holds lands by mili|tary tenure of a baron, on pretence that he al&s;o holds lands of the crown, by &s;occage or any other tenure. Scutages &s;hall be e&s;timated at the &s;ame rate as in the time of Henry I.; and no &s;cutage or aid, except in the three general feudal ca&s;es, the King's captivity, the knighting his elde&s;t &s;on, and the marrying his elde&s;t daughter, &s;hall be impo&s;ed but by the great council of the kingdom; the prelates, earls and great barons, &s;hall be called to this great council, each by a particular writ; the le&s;&s;er barons by a general &s;ummons of the &s;heriff. The King &s;hall not &s;eize any baron's land for a debt to the crown, if the baron po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es as many goods and chattels as are &s;ufficient to di&s;charge that debt. No man &s;hall be obliged to perform more &s;ervice for his fee than he is bound to by his tenure. No governor or con&s;table of a ca&s;tle &s;hall oblige any knight to give money for ca&s;tle-guard, if he is willing to perform the &s;ervice in per&s;on, or by another able-bodied man; and if the knight be in the field him&s;elf, by the King's command, he &s;hall be exempt from all other &s;ervice of this nature. No va&s;&s;al &s;hall be allowed to &s;ell &s;o much of his land as to incapacitate him&s;elf from per|forming his &s;ervice to his lord.</P>
<P>THESE were the principal articles, which were calculated for the intere&s;ts of the barons; and had the charter contained nothing farther, national happine&s;s and liberty had been very little promoted by it, as it would only have tended to increa&s;e the power and independance of an order of men, who were already too powerful, and who&s;e yoke might have become more heavy on the people
<PB REF="394">
than even that of an ab&s;olute monarch. But the barons, who alone drew and impo&s;ed on the prince th s memorable charter, were nece&s;&s;itated to in&s;ert in it other clau&s;es of a more exten&s;ive and more beneficent nature: They could not expect the concurrence of the people, without comprehending, together with their own, the intere&s;ts of inferior ranks of men; and all provi&s;ions, which the ba|rons, for their own &s;akes, were obliged to make, in order to en&s;ure the free and equitable admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, tended directly to the benefit of the whole community. The following were the principal clau&s;es of this nature.</P>
<P>IT was ordained, that all the privileges and immunities above mentioned, granted to the barons again&s;t the King, &s;hould be extended by the barons to their inferior va&s;&s;als. The King bound him&s;elf not to grant any writ, empowering a baron to levy aids from his va&s;&s;als, except in the three feudal ca&s;es. One weight and one mea&s;ure &s;hall be ob&s;erved throughout the whole kingdom. Merchants &s;hall be allowed to tran&s;act all bu&s;ine&s;s, without being expo&s;ed to any arbitrary tolls and impo&s;itions: They and all free men &s;hall be allowed to go out of the kingdom and return to it at plea&s;ure. London, and all cities and burghs, &s;hall pre&s;erve their antient liberties, immunities and free cu&s;toms: Aids &s;hall not be required of them but by the con&s;ent of the great council. No towns nor indivi|duals &s;hall be obliged to make or &s;upport bridges but by antient cu&s;tom. The goods of every free man &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of according to his will: If he die in|te&s;tate, his heirs &s;hall &s;ucceed to them. No officer of the crown &s;hall take any hor&s;es, carts, or wood, without the con&s;ent of the owner. The King's courts of ju&s;tice &s;hall be &s;tationary, and &s;hall no longer follow his per&s;on: They &s;hall be open to every one; and ju&s;tice &s;hall no longer be bought, refu&s;ed, or delayed by them. The &s;heriffs &s;hall be incapacitated to hold pleas of the crown; and &s;hall not put any per&s;on upon his trial, from rumor or &s;u&s;picion alone, but up|on the evidence of lawful witne&s;&s;es. No freeman &s;hall be taken or impri&s;oned, or di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his free tenement and liberties, or outlawed, or bani&s;hed, or any wi&s;e hurt or injured, unle&s;s by the legal judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land; and all who &s;uffered otherwi&s;e in this or the two former reigns, &s;hall be re&s;tored to their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Every freeman &s;hall be fined in proportion to his fault; and no fine &s;hall be levied on him to his utter ruin: Even a villain or ru&s;tic &s;hall not by any fine be bereaved of his carts, ploughs, and implements of hu&s;bandry. This was the only article calculated for the in|tere&s;ts of this body of men, probably at that time the mo&s;t numerous in the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the former articles of the Great Charter contain &s;uch mitigations and explanations of the feudal law as are very rea&s;onable and equi|table;
<PB N="389" REF="395">
and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government, and provide for the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, and free enjoyment of property; the great objects for which political &s;ociety was at fir&s;t founded by men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor &s;tatute, nor po&s;itive in&s;titution, ought to deter them from keep|ing ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts and attention. Tho' the provi&s;ions made by this charter might, conformable to the genius of the age, be e&s;teemed too conci&s;e, and too bare of circum&s;tances, to maintain the execution of its articles, in oppo&s;ition to the chicanery of lawyers, &s;upported by the violence of power; time gradually a&s;certained the &s;en&s;e of all the ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e generous barons, who fir&s;t extorted this conce&s;&s;ion, &s;till held their &s;words in their hands, and could turn them again&s;t tho&s;e who dared, on any pretence, to depart from the original &s;pirit and meaning of the grant. It is now ea&s;y, from the te|nor of this charter, to determine what tho&s;e laws were of King Edward, which the Engli&s;h nation, during &s;o many generations, &s;till de&s;ired, with &s;uch an ob&s;ti|nate per&s;everance, to have recalled and e&s;tabli&s;hed. They were the&s;e latter arti|cles of <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> and the barons, who, at the beginning of the&s;e commo|tions, required the revival of the Saxon laws, undoubtedly thought, that they had &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied the people by procuring them this conce&s;&s;ion, which com|prehended the chief objects to which they had &s;o long a&s;pired. But what we are mo&s;t to admire, is the prudence and moderation of the&s;e haughty nobles them|&s;elves, who were enraged by injuries, enflamed by oppo&s;ition, and elated by a total victory over their &s;overeign. They were contented, even in this plenitude of power, to depart from &s;ome articles of Henry I.'s charter, which they made the foundation of their demands, particularly from the abolition of ward&s;hips, &s;o important a point; and they &s;eem to have been &s;ufficiently careful not to di|mini&s;h too far the power and revenue of the crown. If they appear, therefore, to have carried other demands to too great a height, it can be a&s;cribed only to the faithle&s;s and tyrannical character of the King him&s;elf, of which they had long had experience, and which, they fore&s;aw, would, if they provided no farther &s;e|curity, lead him &s;oon to infringe their liberties, and recall his own conce&s;&s;ions. This alone gave birth to tho&s;e other articles, &s;eemingly exorbitant, which were added as a rampart for the &s;afeguard of the Great Charter.</P>
<P>THE barons obliged the King to agree, that London &s;hould remain in their hands, and the Tower be con&s;igned to the cu&s;tody of the primate, till the 15th of Augu&s;t next, or till the execution of the &s;everal articles of the great charter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 201.

<P>THE character of this prince is nothing but a complication of vices, equally mean and odious; ruinous to him&s;elf, and de&s;tructive to his people. Cowardice, inactivity, folly, levity, licentiou&s;ne&s;s, ingratitude, treachery, tyranny, and cruelty; all the&s;e qualities appear too evidently in the &s;everal incidents of his life to give us any room to &s;u&s;pect, that the di&s;agreeable picture has been any|wi&s;e overcharged by the prejudice of the antient hi&s;torians. It is hard to &s;ay, whether his conduct to his father, his brother, his nephew, or his &s;ubjects was mo&s;t culpable; or whether his crimes in the&s;e re&s;pects were not even exceeded by the ba&s;ene&s;s, which appeared in his tran&s;actions with the King of France, the Pope, and the barons. His dominions, when they devolved to him by the death of his brother, were more exten&s;ive than have, ever &s;ince his time, been ruled by any Engli&s;h monarch: But he fir&s;t lo&s;t by his mi&s;conduct the flouri&s;hing pro|vinces in France, the antient patrimony of his family: He &s;ubjected his kingdom to a &s;hameful va&s;&s;alage under the &s;ee of Rome: He &s;aw the prerogatives of his crown dimini&s;hed by law, and &s;till more reduced by faction: And he died at la&s;t, when in danger of being totally expelled by a foreign power, and of either ending his life mi&s;erably in pri&s;on, or &s;eeking &s;helter as a fugitive from the pur|&s;uit of his enemies.</P>
<P>THE prejudices again&s;t this prince were &s;o violent, that he was believed to have &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to the Miramoulin or Emperor of Morocco, and to have offered to change his religion and become Mahometan, in order to purcha&s;e the protection of that monarch.

<P>THE monks throw great reproaches on this prince for his impiety and even infidelity; and as an in&s;tance of it, they tell us, that having, one day, caught a very fat &s;tag, he exclaimed, <HI>How plump and well fed is this animal; and yet I dare &s;wear he never heard ma&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE feudal law is the chief foundation, both of the political government and of the juri&s;prudence, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Normans in England. Our &s;ubject therefore requires, that we &s;hould form a ju&s;t idea of this law, in order to explain the &s;tate, as well of that kingdom, as of all the other kingdoms of Europe, which, during tho&s;e ages, were governed by &s;imilar in&s;titutions. And tho' I am &s;en&s;ible, that I mu&s;t here repeat many ob&s;ervations and reflections, which have been communicated by others<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des loix. Dr. Robert&s;on's hi&s;tory of Scotland. Dalrymple of feudal Tenures.</NOTE>; yet, as every book, agreeable to the ob&s;ervation of a great hi&s;torian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Padre de Paolo Hi&s;t. Conc. Trid.</NOTE>, &s;hould be as complete as po&s;&s;ible within it&s;elf, and &s;hould never refer, for any thing material, to other books, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary, in this place, to deliver a &s;hort plan of that prodigious fabric, which, for &s;everal centuries, pre&s;erved &s;uch a mixture of liberty and oppre&s;&s;ion, order and anarchy, &s;tability and revolution, as was never experienced in any other age or any other part of the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the feudal law.</NOTE> AFTER the northern nations &s;ubdued the provinces of the Roman empire, they were obliged to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of government, which might &s;ecure their conque&s;ts, as well again&s;t the revolt of their numerous &s;ubjects, who remained in the provinces, as from the inroads of other tribes, who might be tempted to ravi&s;h from them their new acqui&s;itions. The great change of circum&s;tances made them here depart from tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which prevailed among them, while
<PB N="398" REF="404">
they remained in the fore&s;ts of Germany; yet was it &s;till natural for them to re|tain, in their pre&s;ent &s;ettlement, as much of their antient cu&s;toms as was compa|tible with their new &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THE German governments, being more a confederacy of independant war|riors, than a civil &s;ubjection, derived their principal force from many inferior and voluntary a&s;&s;ociations, which individuals formed under a particular head or chieftain, and which it became the highe&s;t point of honour to maintain with in|violable fidelity. The glory of the chieftain con&s;i&s;ted in the number, the bravery, and the zealous attachment of his retainers: The duty of the retainers required that they &s;hould accompany their chieftain in all wars and dangers, that they &s;hould fight and peri&s;h by his &s;ide, and that they &s;hould e&s;teem his renown or his favour a &s;ufficient recompence for all their &s;ervices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de Mor. Germ.</NOTE>. The prince him&s;elf was nothing but a great chieftain, who was cho&s;en from among the re&s;t, on ac|count of his &s;uperior valour or nobility; and who derived his power from the voluntary a&s;&s;ociation or attachment of the other chieftains.</P>
<P>WHEN a tribe, governed by tho&s;e ideas, and actuated by tho&s;e principles, &s;ubdued a large territory, they found, that tho' it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep them|&s;elves in a military po&s;ture, they could neither remain united in a body, nor take up their quarters in &s;everal garri&s;ons, and that their manners and in&s;titu|tions debarred them from u&s;ing tho&s;e expedients, the obvious ones, which, in a like &s;ituation, would have been employed by a civilized nation. Their igno|rance in the art of finances, and perhaps the deva&s;tations in&s;eparable from &s;uch violent conque&s;ts, rendered it impracticable for them to levy taxes &s;ufficient for the pay of numerous armies; and their repugnance to a &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubordination, with their attachment to rural plea&s;ures, made the life of the camp or garri&s;on, if perpetuated during peaceful times, extremely odious and di&s;gu&s;tful to them. They &s;eized, therefore, &s;uch a proportion of the conquered lands as appeared nece&s;&s;ary; they a&s;&s;igned a &s;hare for &s;upporting the dignity of their prince and government; they di&s;tributed other parts, under the title of fiefs, to the chief|tains; the&s;e made a new partition among their retainers; the expre&s;s condition of all the&s;e grants was, that they might be re&s;umed at plea&s;ure, and that the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, &s;o long as he enjoyed them, &s;hould &s;till remain in readine&s;s to take the field for the defence of the nation. And tho' the conquerors immediately &s;epa|rated, in order to enjoy their new acqui&s;itions, their martial di&s;po&s;ition made them readily fulfil the terms of their engagement: They a&s;&s;embled on the fir&s;t alarm; their habitual attachment to the chieftain made them willingly &s;ubmit to his command; and thus a regular military force, tho' concealed, lay always
<PB N="399" REF="405">
ready, to defend, on any emergence, the intere&s;t and honour of the com|munity.</P>
<P>WE are not to imagine, that all or even the greate&s;t part of the conquered lands was &s;eized by the northern conquerors; or that the whole of the land thus &s;eized was &s;ubjected to the&s;e military &s;ervices. This &s;uppo&s;ition is confuted by the hi&s;tory of all the nations on the continent. Even the idea given us of the Ger|man manners by the Roman hi&s;torian, may convince us, that that bold people would never have been contented with &s;o precarious a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or have fought to procure e&s;tabli&s;hments, which were only to continue during the good plea&s;ure of their &s;overeign. Tho' the northern chieftains accepted of lands, which, being con&s;idered as a kind of military pay, might be re&s;umed at the will of the King or general; they al&s;o took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of e&s;tates, which, being hereditary and in|dependant, enabled them to maintain their native liberty, and &s;upport, without court-favour, the honour of their rank and family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the feudallaw.</NOTE> BUT there is a great difference, in the con&s;equences, between the di&s;tribution of a pecuniary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the a&s;&s;ignment of lands burdened with the condi|tion of military &s;ervice. The delivery of the former at the weekly, monthly, or annual terms of payment, &s;till recalls the idea of a voluntary gratuity from the prince, and reminds the &s;oldier of the precarious tenure by which he holds his commi&s;&s;ion. But the attachment naturally formed with a fixed portion of land, gradually begets the idea of &s;omething like property, and makes the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or forget his dependant &s;ituation, and the condition which was at fir&s;t an|nexed to the grant. It &s;eemed equitable, that one who had cultivated and &s;owed a field, &s;hould reap the harve&s;t: Hence fiefs, which were at fir&s;t entirely preca|rious, were &s;oon made annual. A man, who had employed his money in build|ing, planting, or other improvements, expected to reap the fruits of his labour or expence: Hence they were next granted during a term of years. It would be thought hard to expel a man from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, who had always done his duty, and performed the conditions on which he originally received them: Hence the chieftains, in a &s;ub&s;equent period, thought them&s;elves entitled to de|mand the enjoyment of their feudal lands during life. It was found, that a man would, in battle, hazard his life more willingly, if a&s;&s;ured, that his family &s;hould inherit his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;hould not be expo&s;ed by his death to want and po|verty: Hence fiefs were made hereditary in families, and de&s;cended, during one age, to the &s;on; then to the grand&s;on, next to the brothers, and afterwards to more di&s;tant relations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. lib. 1. tit. 1.</NOTE>. The idea of property &s;tole in gradually upon that of
<PB N="400" REF="406">
military pay; and each century made &s;ome &s;en&s;ible addition to the &s;tability of fiefs and tenures.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acqui&s;itions, the chieftain was &s;upported by his va&s;&s;als; who, having originally a &s;trong connexion with him, augmented by the con&s;tant intercour&s;e of good offices, and by the friend&s;hips ari&s;ing from neighbourhood and dependance, were inclined to follow their leader again&s;t all his enemies, and voluntarily, in his private quarrels, pay him the &s;ame obedience, to which by their tenure they were bound in foreign wars. While he daily advanced new preten&s;ions to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;uperior fief, they expected to find the &s;ame advantage in acquiring &s;tability to their &s;ubordinate ones; and they zea|lou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the intru&s;ion of a new lord, who would be inclined, as he was fully intitled, to be&s;tow the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands on his own favourites and retainers. The authority of the &s;overeign gradually decayed; and the nobles, fortified each in his own territory by the attachment of his va&s;&s;als, became too powerful to be expelled by an order from the throne; and he &s;ecured by law what he had at fir&s;t acquired by u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>DURING this precarious &s;tate of the &s;upreme power, a difference would imme|diately be experienced between tho&s;e portions of territory which were &s;ubjected to the feudal tenures, and tho&s;e which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an allodial or free title. Tho' the latter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions had at fir&s;t been e&s;teemed infinitely preferable, they were &s;oon found, by the progre&s;&s;ive changes introduced into public and private law, to be of a much inferior condition to the former. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of a feu|dal territory, united by a regular &s;ubordination under one chieftain, and by the mutual attachments of the va&s;&s;als, had the &s;ame advantages over the proprietors of the other, which a di&s;ciplined army enjoys over a di&s;per&s;ed multitude; and were enabled to commit with impunity all injuries on their defencele&s;s neighbours. Every one, therefore, ha&s;tened to &s;eek that protection which he found &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary; and each allodial proprietor, re&s;igning his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions into the hands of the King, or of &s;ome nobleman re&s;pected for power or valour, received them back with the condition of feudal &s;ervices<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Marculf. Form 47. apud Lindenbr. p. 1238.</NOTE>, which, tho' a burden &s;omewhat grievous, brought him ample compen&s;ation, by connecting him with the neighbouring pro|prietors, and placing him under the guardian&s;hip of a potent chieftain. The decay of the political government thus nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned the exten&s;ion of the feudal: The kingdoms of Europe were univer&s;ally divided into baronics, and the&s;e into inferior fiefs: And the attachment of va&s;&s;als to their chieftain, which was at fir&s;t an e&s;&s;ential part of the German manners, was &s;till &s;upported by the

&s;ame cau&s;es from which it at fir&s;t aro&s;e; the nece&s;&s;ity of mutual protection, and the continued intercour&s;e, between the head and the members, of benefits and &s;ervices.</P>
<P>BUT there was another circum&s;tance, which corroborated the&s;e feudal depen|dancies, and tended to connect the va&s;&s;als with their &s;uperior lord by an indi&s;&s;o|luble bond of union. The northern conquerors, as well as the more early Greeks and Romans, embraced a policy, which is unavoidable to all nations that have made &s;lender advances in refinement; and they every where united the civil juri&s;|diction with the military power. Law, in its commencement, was not an intri|cate &s;cience, and was more governed by maxims of equity, which &s;eem obvious to common &s;en&s;e, than by numerous and &s;ubtile principles, applied to a variety of ca&s;es by profound rea&s;onings from analogy. An officer, tho' he had pa&s;&s;ed his life in the field, was able to determine all legal controver&s;ies which could oc|cur within the di&s;trict committed to his charge; and his deci&s;ions were the mo&s;t likely to meet with a prompt and ready obedience, from men who re&s;pected his per&s;on, and were accu&s;tomed to act under his command. The profit ari&s;ing from puni&s;hments, which were then chiefly pecuniary, was another rea&s;on for his de&s;iring to retain the judicial power; and when his fief became hereditary, this authority, which was e&s;&s;ential to it, was al&s;o tran&s;mitted to his po&s;terity. The counts and other magi&s;trates, who&s;e power was merely official, were tempted, in imitation of the feudal lords, whom they re&s;embled in &s;o many particulars, to render their dignity perpetual and hereditary; and in the decline of the regal power, they found no difficulty to make good their preten&s;ions. After this manner, the va&s;t fabric of feudal &s;ubordination became quite &s;olid and compre|hen&s;ive; it formed every where an e&s;&s;ential part of the political con&s;titution; and the Norman and other barons, who followed the fortunes of William, were &s;o accu&s;tomed to it, that they could &s;carce form an idea of any other &s;pecies of ci|vil government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ideas of the feudal government were &s;o rooted, that even lawyers, in tho&s;e ages, could not form a notion of any other con&s;titution. <HI>Regnum,</HI> (&s;ays Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 34.) <HI>quod ex comitatibus &amp; baronibus dicitur e&s;&s;e con&s;titutum.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, who conquered England, as they exterminated the antient inha|bitants, and were &s;ecured by the &s;ea again&s;t new invaders, found it le&s;s requi&s;ite to maintain them&s;elves in a military po&s;ture; and the quantity of land which they annexed to offices, &s;eems to have been of &s;mall value; and for that rea&s;on conti|nued the longer in its original &s;ituation, and was always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed during plea&s;ure by tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the command.

The va&s;|&s;al was obliged to defend his baron in war; and the baron, at the head of his va&s;&s;als, was bound to fight in defence of the King and kingdom. But be&s;ides the&s;e military &s;ervices, which were ca&s;ual, there were others impo&s;ed of a civil nature, which were more con&s;tant and perpetual.</P>
<P>THE northern nations had no idea, that any man, trained up to honour, or enured to arms, was ever to be governed, without his own con&s;ent, by the ab&s;o|lute will of another; or that the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was ever to be exerci&s;ed by the private opinion of any one magi&s;trate, without the concurrence of &s;ome other per&s;ons, who&s;e intere&s;t might induce them to check his arbitrary and ini|quitous deci&s;ions. The King, therefore, when he found it nece&s;&s;ary to demand any &s;ervices of his barons or chief tenants, beyond what was due by their tenures, was obliged to a&s;&s;emble them, in order to procure their <HI>con&s;ent:</HI> And when it was nece&s;&s;ary to determine any controver&s;y among the barons them&s;elves, the que&s;tion mu&s;t be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their pre&s;ence, and be decided according to their opinion or <HI>advice.</HI> In the&s;e two circum&s;tances of con&s;ent and advice, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly the civil &s;ervices of the antient barons; and the&s;e implied all the con&s;i|derable incidents of governments. In one view, the barons regarded this atten|dance as their principal <HI>privilege;</HI> in another, as a grievous <HI>burden.</HI> That no momentous affairs could be tran&s;acted without their con&s;ent and advice, was in <HI>general</HI> e&s;teemed the great &s;ecurity of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and dignities; but as they reaped no immediate profit from their attendance at court, and were expo&s;ed to great inconvenience and charge by an ab&s;ence from their own e&s;tates, every one was glad to exempt him&s;elf from each <HI>particular</HI> exertion of this power; and was plea&s;ed both that the call for that duty &s;hould return &s;eldom upon him, and that
<PB N="403" REF="409">
others &s;hould undergo the burden in his &s;tead. The King, on the other hand, was u&s;ually anxious, for &s;everal rea&s;ons, that the a&s;&s;embly of the barons &s;hould be full at every &s;tated or ca&s;ual time of meeting: This attendance was the chief badge of their &s;ubordination to his crown, and drew them from that independance which they were apt to affect in their own ca&s;tles and manors; and where the meeting was thin or ill attended, its determinations had le&s;s authority, and were not followed by &s;o ready an obedience from the whole community.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e was the &s;ame with the barons in their courts as with the King in the &s;upreme council of the nation. It was requi&s;ite to a&s;&s;emble the va&s;&s;als, in order to determine by their vote any que&s;tion which regarded the barony; and they &s;at along with the chieftain in all trials, whether civil or criminal, which occurred within the limits of their juri&s;diction. They were bound to pay &s;uit and &s;ervice at the court of their baron; and as their tenure was military, and con&s;equently honourable, they were admitted into his &s;ociety, and partook of his friend&s;hip. Thus, a kingdom was only con&s;idered as a great barony, and a barony as a &s;mall kingdom. The barons were peers to each other in the national council, and, in &s;ome degree, companions to the King: The va&s;&s;als were peers to each other in the court of barony, and companions to their baron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Cange Glo&s;&s;. in verb.

<P>BUT tho' this re&s;emblance &s;o far took place, the va&s;&s;als, by the natural cour&s;e of things, univer&s;ally, in the feudal con&s;titutions, fell into a greater &s;ubordina|tion under the baron, than the baron him&s;elf under his &s;overeign; and the&s;e go|vernments had a nece&s;&s;ary and infallible tendency to augment the power of the nobles. The great chieftain, re&s;iding in his country-&s;eat or ca&s;tle, which he was commonly allowed to fortify, lo&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, his connexion or ac|quaintance with the prince; and added every day new force to his authority over the va&s;&s;als of the barony. They received from him education in all military ex|erci&s;es: His ho&s;pitality invited them to live and enjoy &s;ociety in his hall: Their leizure, which was great, made them perpetual retainers on his per&s;on, and par|takers of his country &s;ports and amu&s;ements: They had no means of gratifying their ambition but by making a figure in his train: His favour and countenance was their greate&s;t honour: His di&s;plea&s;ure expo&s;ed them to contempt and igno|miny: And they felt every moment the nece&s;&s;ity of his protection, both in the controver&s;ies which occurred with other va&s;&s;als, and what was more material, in the daily inroads and injuries which were committed by the neighbouring barons. During the time of general war, the &s;overeign, who marched at the head of his armies, and was the great protector of the &s;tate, acquired always &s;ome acce&s;&s;ion

to his authority, which he lo&s;t during the intervals of peace and tranquillity: But the loo&s;e police incident to the feudal con&s;titutions, maintained a perpetual, tho' &s;ecret ho&s;tility, between the &s;everal members of the &s;tate; and the va&s;&s;als found no other means of &s;ecurity again&s;t the injuries to which they were conti|nually expo&s;ed, but by clo&s;ely adhering to their chieftain, and falling into a &s;ub|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ive dependance upon him.</P>
<P>IF the feudal government was &s;o little favourable to the true liberty even of the military v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, it was &s;till more de&s;tructive of the independance and &s;ecurity of the other members of the &s;tate, or what in a proper &s;en&s;e we call the people. A great part of them were <HI>&s;erfs,</HI> and lived in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;lavery or villain|age: The other inhabitants of the country paid their rent in &s;ervices which were in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary, and they could expect no redre&s;s of injuries in a court of barony from men who thought they had a right to oppre&s;s and tyrannize over them: The towns were &s;ituated either within the deme&s;nes of the King, or the lands of the great barons, and were almo&s;t entirely &s;ubjected to the ab&s;olute will of their ma&s;ter. The langui&s;hing &s;tate of commerce kept the inhabitants poor and contemptible; and the political in&s;titutions were calculated to render that poverty perpetual. The barons and gentry, living in ru&s;tic plenty and ho&s;|pitality, gave no encouragement to the arts, and had no demand for any of the more elaborate produce of manufactures: Every profe&s;&s;ion was held in contempt but that of arms: And if any merchant or manufacturer ro&s;e by indu&s;try and frugality to a degree of opulence, he found him&s;elf but the more expo&s;ed to in|juries, from the envy and avidity of the military nobles.</P>
<P>THESE concurring cau&s;es gave the feudal governments &s;o &s;trong a bia&s;s towards ari&s;tocracy, that the royal authority was extremely eclip&s;ed in all the European &s;tates; and, in&s;tead of dreading the growth of monarchical power, we might ra|ther expect, that the community would every where crumble into &s;o many inde|pendant baronies, and lo&s;e the political union by which they were cemented. In elective monarchies, the event was commonly an&s;werable to this expectation; and the barons, gaining ground on every vacancy of the throne, rai&s;ed them&s;elves almo&s;t to a &s;tate of &s;overeignty, and &s;acrificed to their power both the rights of the crown and the liberties of the people. But hereditary monarchies had a prin|ciple of authority, which was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ubverted; and there were &s;everal cau&s;es, which &s;till maintained a degree of influence in the hands of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t baron could never lo&s;e view entirely of tho&s;e principles of the feu|dal con&s;titution, which bound him, as a va&s;&s;al, to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and fidelity towards his prince; becau&s;e he was every moment obliged to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e prin|ciples, in exacting fidelity and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from his own va&s;&s;als. The le&s;&s;er ba|rons,
<PB N="405" REF="411">
finding that the annihilation of royal authority le&s;t them expo&s;ed without protection to the in&s;ults and injuries of more potent neighbours, naturally ad|hered to the crown, and promoted the execution of general and equal laws. The people had &s;till a &s;tronger intere&s;t to de&s;ire the grandeur of the &s;overeign; and the King, being the legal magi&s;trate, who &s;uffered by every internal convul|&s;ion or oppre&s;&s;ion, and who regarded the great nobles as his immediate rivals, a&s;&s;umed the &s;alutary office of general guardian or protector of the commons. Be&s;ides the prerogatives with which the law endowed him; his large deme&s;nes and numerous retainers rendered him, in one &s;en&s;e, the greate&s;t baron of his kingdom; and where he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of per&s;onal vigor and ability (for his &s;itua|tion required the&s;e advantages) he was commonly able to pre&s;erve his authority, and maintain his &s;tation as head of the community, and the chief fountain of law and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Kings of the Norman race were favoured by another circum&s;tance, which pre&s;erved them from the encroachments of their barons. They were gene|rals of a conquering army, which was obliged to continue in a military po&s;ture, and to maintain great &s;ubordination under their leader, in order to &s;ecure them|&s;elves from the revolt of the numerous natives, whom they had bereaved of all their properties and privileges. But tho' this circum&s;tance &s;upported the authority of William and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and rendered them extremely ab&s;olute, it was lo&s;t as &s;oon as the Norman barons began to coale&s;ce with the nation, to ac|quire a &s;ecurity in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to fix their influence over their va&s;&s;als, tenants, and &s;laves. And the immen&s;e fortunes, which the Conqueror had be|&s;towed on his chief captains, &s;erved to &s;upport their independancy, and make them formidable to the &s;overeign.</P>

<P>THE barons were another con&s;tituent part of the great council of the nation. The&s;e held immediately of the crown by a military tenure: They were the mo&s;t honourable members of the &s;tate, and had a <HI>right</HI> to be con&s;ulted in all public deliberations: They were the immediate va&s;&s;als of the crown, and owed as a <HI>&s;ervice</HI> their attendance in the court of their Supreme Lord.

of any cau&s;e or controver&s;y among them had any validity, where the vote and advice of the whole body did not concur. The dignity of earl or count was of|ficial and territorial, as well as hereditary; and as all the earls were al&s;o barons, they were con&s;idered as military va&s;&s;als of the crown, were admitted in that ca|pacity into the general council, and formed the mo&s;t honourable and powerful branch of it.</P>
<P>BUT there was another cla&s;s of the immediate military tenants of the crown, equally numerous with the barons, the tenants <HI>in capite</HI> by knights &s;ervice; and the&s;e, however inferior in power or property, held by a tenure, which was equally honourable as that of the others.

All the immediate military tenants of the crown amounted not fully to 700, when Dome&s;day book was framed; and as the members were well plea&s;ed, on any pretext, to excu&s;e them&s;elves from attendance, the a&s;&s;embly was never likely on any occa&s;ion to become too numerous for the di&s;patch of public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>THE great &s;imilarity among all the feudal governments of Europe is well known to every man, that has any acquaintance with antient hi&s;tory; and the antiqua|rians of all foreign countries, where the que&s;tion was never embara&s;&s;ed by party di&s;putes, have allowed, that the commons were very late in being admitted to a &s;hare in the legi&s;lative power. In Normandy particularly, who&s;e con&s;titution was mo&s;t likely to be William's model in rai&s;ing his new fabric of the Engli&s;h government, the &s;tates were entirely compo&s;ed of the clergy and nobility; and the fir&s;t incorporated boroughs or communities of that dutchy were Ro&uuml;en and Falai&s;e, which enjoyed their privileges by a grant of Philip Augu&s;tus in the year 1207<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Norman.

All the antient Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, when they mention the great council of the nation, call it an a&s;&s;embly of the baronage, nobility or great men; and none of their expre&s;&s;ions, tho' &s;everal hundred pa&s;&s;ages might be produced, can, without the utmo&s;t violence, be tortured to a meaning, which will admit the commons to be con&s;tituent members of that body<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the hi&s;torians mention the people, <HI>populus,</HI> as a part of the parliament: But they always mean the laity, in oppo&s;ition to the clergy.

The <HI>magna charta</HI> of King John provides, that no tax or &s;cutage &s;hould be impo&s;ed but by the con&s;ent of the great council; and for more &s;ecurity, it enumerates the per&s;ons intitled to a &s;eat in that council, the prelates and immediate tenants of the crown, without any mention of the commons: An authority &s;o full, certain and explicite, that nothing but the zeal of party could ever have procured credit to any contrary &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IT was probably the example of the French barons which fir&s;t emboldened the Engli&s;h to require greater independance from their &s;overeign: It is al&s;o probable, that the boroughs and corporations of England were e&s;tabli&s;hed in imitation of

tho&s;e of France. It may, therefore, be propo&s;ed, as no unlikely conjecture, that both the privileges of the peers and the liberty of the commons were originally the growth of that country.</P>
<P>IN antient times, men were very little &s;olicitous to obtain a place in the legi&s;|lative a&s;&s;emblies; and rather regarded their attendance as a burden, which was not compen&s;ated by any return of profit or honour, proportioned to the trouble and expence. The only rea&s;on of in&s;tituting tho&s;e public councils, was; on the part of the &s;ubject, that they de&s;ired &s;ome &s;ecurity from the attempts of arbitrary power; and on the part of the &s;overeign, that he de&s;paired of governing men of &s;uch independant &s;pirits without their own con&s;ent and concurrence. But the commons, or the inhabitants of boroughs, had not as yet reached &s;uch a degree of con&s;ideration, as to de&s;ire <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> again&s;t their prince, or to imagine, that, even if they were a&s;&s;embled in a repre&s;entative body, they had power or rank &s;ufficient to enforce it. The only protection, which they a&s;pired to, was again&s;t the im|mediate violence and inju&s;tice of their fellow-citizens; and this advantage each of them looked for, from the courts of ju&s;tice, or from the authority of &s;ome great lord, to whom, by law or his own choice, he was attached. On the other hand, the &s;overeign was &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured of obedience in the whole community, if he procured the concurrence of the nobles; nor had he rea&s;on to apprehend, that any order of the &s;tate could re&s;i&s;t his and their united authority. The mili|tary va&s;&s;als could entertain no idea of oppo&s;ing both their prince and their &s;u|periors: The burge&s;&s;es and trade&s;men could much le&s;s a&s;pire to &s;uch a thought: And thus, even if hi&s;tory were &s;ilent on that head, we have rea&s;on to conclude, from the known &s;ituation of mankind during the&s;e ages, that the commons were never admitted as members of the legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>THE <HI>executive</HI> power of the Anglo-Norman government was lodged in the King; and be&s;ides the &s;tated meetings of the national council at the three great fe&s;tivals of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Whit&s;untide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugd Orig.

But the great power of the Conqueror e&s;tabli&s;hed at fir&s;t in England an authority, which the monarchs in France were not able to attain till the reign of St. Lewis, who lived near two centuries after: He empowered his court to receive appeals both from the courts of barony and the county-courts, and by that means brought the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice ultimately into the hands of the &s;overeign<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madox.

But the county-courts were much di&s;credited; and as the freeholders were found ignorant of the intricate principles and forms of the new law, the lawyers gradually brought all bu&s;ine&s;s before the King's judges, and abandoned the antient &s;imple and popular judicature. After this manner, the formalities of ju&s;tice, which, tho' they appear tedious and cumber&s;ome, are found requi&s;ite to the &s;upport of liberty in all monarchical governments, proved at fir&s;t, by a combination of cau&s;es, very advantageous to the royal authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenue of the crown.</NOTE> THE power of the Norman kings was al&s;o much &s;upported by a great revenue; and by a revenue, that was fixed, perpetual, and independant of the &s;ubject.

In tho&s;e days of vio|lence, many in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed unheeded; and were &s;oon after openly pleaded as precedents, which it was unlawful to di&s;pute or controul.

<P>THE fir&s;t branch of the King's &s;tated revenue was the royal deme&s;nes or crown-lands, which were very exten&s;ive, and comprehended, be&s;ide a great number of manors, mo&s;t of the chief cities of the kingdom. It was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, that the King could alienate no part of his deme&s;ne, and that he him&s;elf, or his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or, could, at any time, re&s;ume &s;uch donations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fleta, lib. 1. cap. 8, 17. lib. 3. cap. 6. &sect; 3.

The Conqueror granted by his laws, that the barons &s;hould be obliged to pay nothing beyond their &s;tated &s;ervices<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. Conq. &sect; 55.</NOTE>, except a rea&s;onable aid to ran&s;om his per&s;on if he were taken in war, to make his elde&s;t &s;on a knight, and to marry his elde&s;t daughter. What &s;hould, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, be deemed a rea&s;onable aid, was not determined; and the de|mands of the crown were &s;o far di&s;cretionary.</P>
<P>THE King could require in war the per&s;onal attendance of his va&s;&s;als, that is, of all the landed proprietors; and if they declined the &s;ervice, they were obliged to pay him a compo&s;ition in money, which was called a &s;cutage. The &s;um was, during &s;ome reigns, very precarious and uncertain; it was &s;ometimes levied without allowing the va&s;&s;al the liberty of per&s;onal &s;ervice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gerva&s;e de Tilbury, p. 25.</NOTE>; and it was an u&s;ual artifice of the King to pretend an expedition, that he might be intitled to levy the &s;cutage from his military tenants. Danegelt was another &s;pecies of land-tax levied by the early Norman kings, arbitrarily, and contrary to the laws of the Conqueror<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 475.</NOTE>.

Indeed, it appears from that charter, that, tho' the Conqueror had granted his military tenants an immunity from all taxes and tailliages, he and his &s;on William had never thought them&s;elves bound to ob&s;erve that rule, but had levied impo&s;itions at plea&s;ure on all the landed e&s;tates
<PB N="415" REF="421">
of the kingdom. The utmo&s;t that Henry grants, is, that the land cultivated by the military tenant him&s;elf &s;hall not be &s;o burdened; but he re&s;erves the power of taxing the farmers: And as it is known, that Henry's charter was never ob&s;er|ved in any one article, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that this prince and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors re|tracted even this &s;mall indulgence, and levied arbitrary impo&s;itions on all the lands of all their &s;ubjects.

<P>THE e&s;cheats were a great branch both of power and of revenue to the King, e&s;pecially during the fir&s;t reigns after the conque&s;t. In default of de&s;cendants from the fir&s;t baron, his land reverted to the crown, and continually augmented the King's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The prince had indeed by law a power of alienating the&s;e e&s;cheats; but by this means he enjoyed an opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing the for|tunes of his friends and &s;ervants, and thereby enlarging his authority. Some|times he retained them in his own hands, and they were gradually confounded with his royal deme&s;nes, and became difficult to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from them.

We have not here enumerated all the &s;pecies of felonies, or of crimes by which forfeiture was incurred: We have &s;aid enough to prove, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of feudal property was antiently &s;omewhat precarious, and that the primary idea was never entirely lo&s;t, of its being a kind of <HI>fee</HI> or <HI>benefice:</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a baron died, the King immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate; and the heir, before he recovered his right, was obliged to make application to the crown, to de&s;ire that he might be admitted to do homage for his land, and to pay a compo&s;ition to the King. This compo&s;ition was not at fir&s;t fixed by law, at lea&s;t by practice: The King was often very exorbitant in his demands, and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land till they were complied with.</P>
<P>IF the heir was a minor, the King retained the whole profit of the e&s;tate till his majority; and might grant what &s;um he thought proper for the education and maintenance of the young baron. This practice was al&s;o founded on the notion, that a fief was a benefice, and that, while the heir could not perform his military &s;ervices, the revenue devolved to the &s;uperior, who employed another in his place. It is obvious, that a great proportion of the landed property mu&s;t, by means of this device, be continually in the hands of the prince, and that all the noble fa|milies were thereby held in continual dependance. When the King granted the ward&s;hip of a rich heir to any one, he had the opportunity of enriching a favour|ite or mini&s;ter: If he &s;old it, he was thereby able to levy a con&s;iderable &s;um of money. Simon de Mountfort paid Henry III. 10,000 marks, an immen&s;e &s;um in tho&s;e days, for the ward&s;hip of Gilbert de Umfreville<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF the heir was a female, the King was entitled to offer her any hu&s;band of her rank he thought proper; and if &s;he refu&s;ed him, &s;he forfeited her land. Even a male heir could not marry without the royal con&s;ent, and it was u&s;ual for men to pay large &s;ums for the liberty of making their own choice in marriage<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 320.</NOTE>. No man could di&s;po&s;e of his land, either by &s;ale or will, without the con&s;ent of his &s;uperior. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was never con&s;idered as full proprietor: He was &s;till a kind of beneficiary; and could not oblige his &s;uperior to accept of any va&s;&s;al, who was not agreeable to him.</P>
<P>FINES, amerciaments, and oblatas, as they were called, were another con&s;i|derable branch of the royal power and revenue. The antient records of the exchequer, which are &s;till pre&s;erved, give &s;urprizing accounts of the numerous fines and amerciaments levied in tho&s;e days<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 272.</NOTE>, and of the &s;trange inventions fallen upon to exact money from the &s;ubject.

whom no man mu&s;t approach without a pre&s;ent, who &s;ell all their good offices, and who intrude them&s;elves into every bu&s;ine&s;s, that they may have a pretence of extorting money.

But the barons &s;urely were not &s;o pa&s;&s;ive as to entru&s;t a power, entirely arbitrary and de&s;potic, into the hands of the &s;overeign. It only appears, that the con&s;titution had not fixed any preci&s;e boundaries to the royal power; that the right of i&s;&s;uing proclama|tions on any emergence and of exacting obedience to them, a right which was always &s;uppo&s;ed inherent in the crown, is very difficult to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a legi&s;lative authority; that the extreme imperfection of the antient laws and the &s;udden exigencies, which often occurred in &s;uch turbulent governments, obliged the prince to exert frequently the latent powers of his prerogative; that he na|turally proceeded, from the acquie&s;cence of the people, to a&s;&s;ume, in many par|ticulars of moment, an authority, from which he had excluded him&s;elf by expre&s;s &s;tatutes, charters or conce&s;&s;ions, and which was, in the main, repugnant to the general genius of the con&s;titution; and that the lives, the per&s;onal liberty, and the properties of all his &s;ubjects were le&s;s &s;ecured by law again&s;t the exertion of his arbitrary authority, than by the independant power and private connexions of each individual. It appears from the great charter it&s;elf, that not only John, a tyrannical prince, and Richard, a violent one, but their father, Henry, under who&s;e reign the prevalence of gro&s;s abu&s;es is the lea&s;t to be &s;u&s;pected, was ac|cu&s;tomed, from his &s;ole authority, without proce&s;s of law, to impri&s;on, bani&s;h and attaint the freemen of his kingdom.</P>
<P>A GREAT baron, in antient times, con&s;idered him&s;elf as a kind of &s;overeign within his territory; and was attended with courtiers and dependants more zealou&s;ly attached to him than the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and the great officers were commonly to <HI>their</HI> &s;overeign.

He had the power, with the King's con&s;ent, to exact talliages even from the free-citizens who lived within his barony; and as his nece&s;&s;ities made him rapacious, his authority was u&s;ually found to be more oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical than the &s;overeign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madox.

The vir|tuous knight fought not only in his own quarrel; but in that of the innocent, the helple&s;s, and above all, of the fair, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be for ever under the guardian&s;hip of his valiant arm. The uncourteous knight, who, from his ca&s;tle, exerci&s;ed robbery on travellers, and committed violence on virgins, was the object of his perpetual indignation; and he put him to death, without &s;cruple or trial or appeal, wherever he met with him. The great independance of men made per&s;onal honour and fidelity the chief tie among them; and rendered it the capital virtue of every true knight, or genuine profe&s;&s;or of chivalry. The &s;o|lemnities of &s;ingle combat, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, bani&s;hed the notion of every thing unfair or unequal in rencounters; and maintained an appearance of cour|te&s;y between the combatants, till the moment of their engagement.

<P>THE conce&s;&s;ion of the Great Charter, or rather its full e&s;tabli&s;hment (for there was a con&s;iderable interval between the one and the other) gave ri&s;e, by degrees, to a new &s;pecies of government, and introduced &s;ome order and ju&s;tice into the admini&s;tration. The en&s;uing &s;cenes of our hi&s;tory are therefore &s;omewhat dif|ferent

from the preceding. Yet the Great Charter contained no e&s;tabli&s;hment of new counts, magi&s;trates, or &s;enates, nor abolition of the old. It introduced no new di&s;tribution of the powers of the commonwealth, and no innovation in the political or public law of the kingdom. It only guarded, and that merely by verbal clau&s;es, again&s;t &s;uch tyrannical practices as are incompatible with civilized government, and, if they become very frequent, are incompatible with all go|vernment. The barbarous licence of the kings, and perhaps of the nobles, was thenceforth &s;omewhat more re&s;trained: Men acquired &s;ome more &s;ecurity for their properties and their liberties: And government approached a little nearer to that end, for which it was originally in&s;tituted, the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, and the equal protection of the citizens. Acts of violence and iniquity in the crown, which before were only deemed injuries to individuals, and were hazardous chiefly in proportion to the number, power, and dignity of the per&s;ons affected by them, were now regarded, in &s;ome degree, as public injuries, and as infringements of a charter, calculated for general &s;ecurity. And thus, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Great Charter, without &s;eeming any-wi&s;e to innovate in the di&s;tribution of political power, became a kind of epoch in the con&s;titution.</P>
