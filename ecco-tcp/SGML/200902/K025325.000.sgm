<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by DAVID GARRICK, E&s;q.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Kelly originally intended the prologue to be grave, and accor|dingly wrote a &s;erious one him&s;elf; but as Mr. King was to &s;peak it, Mr. Garrick, with great propriety, thought a piece of humour would be be&s;t &s;uited to the talents of that excellent actor, and therefore very kindly took the trouble of putting it into a form &s;o entirely different from the fir&s;t, that it cannot, with the lea&s;t ju&s;tice, be attributed to any other author.</NOTE></BYLINE>

<L>Do, Ladies, lock upon me &mdash; nay, no &s;imp'ring &mdash;</L>
<L>Think you this face was ever made for whimp'ring?</L>

<P>Re&s;pect! &mdash; Why &s;he always &s;peaks of you with the greate&s;t re&s;pect; does it therefore follow that &s;he loves you?

</SP>
<SP>

<P>And is'nt there a great deal to &s;ay in exte|nuation of an error which proceeds from a prin|ciple of real affection?</P>

<P>Affection! ridiculous! but you &s;hall have an in&s;tance of this wonderful affection: &mdash; T'other day I din'd at his hou&s;e, and, though the wea|ther was intollerably warm, the table was laid in a clo&s;e room, with a fire large enough to roa&s;t an ox for a country corporation.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="12">evening, which terri&s;ied Lord Hectic out of his wits, and &s;o for fear &s;he might run the chance of a &s;light cold, he expo&s;ed her to the hazard of ab&s;olute &s;uffocation.</P>

<P>Dear Emmy you mi&s;take the matter &s;trangely. &mdash; Lord Winworth is no common man, nor wou'd he have continued his &s;ilence &s;o long upon his favourite &s;ubject, if he had the lea&s;t inclination to renew his addre&s;&s;es. &mdash; His pride has ju&s;tly taken the alarm at my in&s;en&s;ibility, and he will not, I am &s;atisfied, run the hazard of another refu&s;al.</P>

<P>I have repeatedly told you becau&s;e I was a fool, Emmy. &mdash; Till he withdrew his addre&s;&s;es I knew not how much I e&s;teemed him; my unhappine&s;s in my fir&s;t marriage, you know, made me re&s;olve again&s;t another. &mdash; And you are al&s;o &s;en&s;ible I have frequently argued that a woman of real de|licacy &s;hou'd never admit a &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion on her heart.</P>

<P>Dear Cecil, I am more to be pitied than con|demned in this tran&s;action. &mdash; when I fir&s;t endea|voured to make my&s;elf agreeable to Mi&s;s Rivers, I imagined her family would readily countenance my addre&s;&s;es, and when I &s;ucceeded in that en|deavour, I had not time to declare my&s;elf in form, before her father entred into this engagement with Sidney. &mdash; The moment I heard it mention|ed, I wrote to him, offering him a <HI>carte blanche,</HI> and this morning a repetition of my offer was treated with contempt. &mdash; I have therefore been forc'd into the mea&s;ure you di&s;approve &s;o much&mdash; but I hope my conduct, in the character of the &s;on-in-law, will amply atone for any error in my behaviour as a friend.</P>

<P>O, Sally, you can't conceive my di&s;tre&s;s in this critical &s;ituation. &mdash; An elopement even from a tyrannical father, has &s;omething in it which mu&s;t &s;hock a delicate mind. &mdash; But when a woman flies from the protection of a parent, who merits the utmo&s;t return of her affection, &s;he mu&s;t be in&s;en|&s;ible indeed, if &s;he does not feel the &s;incere&s;t re|gret: &mdash; If he &s;houd'nt forgive me! &mdash;</P>

<P>Look back, infatuated child, upon my whole conduct &s;ince your approach to maturity: Hav'n't I contracted my own enjoyments on purpo&s;e to enlarge yours, and watched your very looks to anticipate your inclinations? Have I ever, with the ob&s;tinacy of other fathers, been partial in favour of any man to whom you made the &s;lighte&s;t objection. &mdash; Or have I ever &s;hewn
<PB N="65" REF="71">the lea&s;t de&s;ign of forcing your wi&s;hes to my own humour or caprice?

<L>Pray does that weed, <HI>Fal&s;e Delicacy,</HI> grow?</L>
<L>O, No. &mdash;</L>
<L>Among the fair of fa&s;hion; common breeding,</L>
<L>Is there one bo&s;om, where <HI>love lies a bleeding?</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>olden</HI> times your grannams unrefin'd,</L>
<L>Ty'd up the tongue, put padlocks on the mind;</L>
<L>O, Ladies, thank your &s;tars, there's nothing now confin'd.</L>
<L>In love you <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, &mdash; there's no concealing,</L>
<L>Are mo&s;t, like <HI>Winworth,</HI> &s;imple in your dealing;</L>
<L>But <HI>Britons,</HI> in their natures, as their names,</L>
<L>Are different as the <HI>Shanon, Tweed,</HI> and <HI>Thames.</HI></L>
<L>As the <HI>Tweed</HI> flows, the bonny <HI>Scot</HI> proceeds,</L>
<L>Wunds &s;law, and &s;ure, and nae ob&s;truction heeds;</L>
<L>Though oft repuls'd, his purpo&s;e &s;till hauds fa&s;t,</L>
<L>Stecks like a burr, and wuns the La&s;s at la&s;t.</L>
<L>The <HI>Shannon,</HI> rough and vigorous, pours along,</L>
<L>Like the bold accents of brave <HI>Paddy's</HI> tongue:</L>
<L>Arrah, dear creature &mdash; can you &s;corn me &s;o?</L>
<L>Ca&s;t your &s;weet eyes upon me, top and toe!</L>
<L>Not fancy <HI>me?</HI> &mdash; Pooh! &mdash; that's all game and laughter,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t marry me, my jew'l &mdash; ho! &mdash; you'll love me after.</L>
<L>Like his own <HI>Thames,</HI> hone&s;t <HI>John Trot,</HI> their brother,</L>
<L>More quick than <HI>one,</HI> and much le&s;s bold than t'other,</L>
<L><HI>Gentle not dull,</HI> his loving arms will &s;pread;</L>
<L>But &s;topt &mdash; in willows hides his ba&s;hful head;</L>
<L><HI>John</HI> leaves his home, re&s;olv'd to tell his pain;</L>
<L>He&s;itates &mdash; I &mdash; love &mdash; <HI>fye, Sir &mdash; 'tis in vain,</HI> &mdash;</L>
<L><HI>John</HI> blu&s;hes, turns him round, and whi&s;tles home again.</L>
<L>Well! is my painting like? &mdash; Or do you doubt it? &mdash;</L>
<L>What &s;ay you to a trial? &mdash; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t's about it.</L>
<L>Let Cupid lead <HI>three Britons</HI> to the field,</L>
<L>And try which fir&s;t can make a dam&s;el yield;</L>
<L>What &s;ay you to a <HI>widow?</HI> &mdash; Smile con&s;ent,</L>
<L>And &s;he'll be ready for experiment.</L>
