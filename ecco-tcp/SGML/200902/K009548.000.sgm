<HEAD>BLACK GILES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>POACHING GILES lived on the borders of one of tho&s;e great Moors in Somer&s;et&s;hire. Giles, to be &s;ure, has been a &s;ad fellow in his time; and it is none of his fault if his whole family do not end either at the gallows or at Botany Bay. He lives at that Mud Cottage with the broken windows, &s;tuffed with dirty rags, ju&s;t beyond the gate which divides the upper from the lower Moor. You may know the hou&s;e at a good di&s;tance by the ragged tiles on the roof, and the loo&s;e &s;tones which are ready to drop out from the chimney; though a &s;hort ladder, a hod of mortar, and half an hour's lei&s;ure time would have prevented all this, and made the little dwelling tight enough. But as Giles had never learnt any thing that was good, &s;o he did not know the value of &s;uch u&s;eful &s;ayings as, that <HI>"a tile in time &s;aves nine."</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, Giles fell into that common mi&s;take, that a beggarly looking cottage, and filthy ragged children rai&s;ed mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, and of cour&s;e drew mo&s;t charity. But as cunning as he was in other things, he was out in his reckoning here
<PB N="4" REF="3">
for it is neatne&s;s, hou&s;ewifery, and a decent ap|pearance which draws the kindne&s;s of the rich and charitable, while they turn away di&s;gu&s;ted from filth and lazine&s;s; not out of pride, but becau&s;e they &s;ee that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to mend the condition of tho&s;e who degrade them&s;elves by dirt and &s;loth.</P>
<P>The common on which Giles's hovel &s;tands is quite a deep mar&s;h in a wet winter, but in &s;ummer it looks green and pretty enough. To be &s;ure it would be rather convenient when one pa&s;&s;es that way in a carriage, if one of the children would run out and open the gate, as it would &s;ave the po&s;t boy from getting off, which is not very &s;afe for the people within the chai&s;e; but in&s;tead of any <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e children running out as &s;oon as they hear the wheels, which would be quite time enough, what does Giles do, but &s;et all his ragged brats, with dirty faces, matted locks, and naked feet and legs, to lie all day upon a &s;and bank hard by the gate, waiting for the &s;lender chance of what may be picked up from travellers. At the &s;ound of a carriage, a whole covey of the&s;e little &s;care|crows &s;tart up, ru&s;h to the gate, and all at once thru&s;t out their hats and aprons; and for fear this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ogether with the noi&s;e of their clamorous beg|ging, &s;hould not &s;ufficiently frighten the hor&s;es, they are very apt to let the gate &s;lap full again&s;t you, before you are half way through, in their eager &s;cuffle to &s;natch from each other the half|pence which you may have thrown out to them. I know two ladies who were one day very near be|ing killed by the&s;e abominable tricks.</P>
<P>Thus five or &s;ix little idle creatures, who might be earning a trifle by knitting at home; who might
<PB N="5" REF="4">
be u&s;eful to the public by working in the field, and who might a&s;&s;i&s;t their families by learning to get their bread twenty hone&s;t ways, are &s;uffered to lie about all day, in the hope of a few chance halfpence, which, after all, they are by no means &s;ure of get|ting. Indeed, when the neighbouring gentlefolks found out that opening the gate was the family trade, they &s;oon left off giving any thing. And I my&s;elf, though I u&s;ed to take out a penny ready to give, had there been only <HI>one</HI> to receive it, when I &s;ee a whole family e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;o beggarly a trade, quietly put it back again into my pocket, and give nothing at all. And &s;o few travellers pa&s;s that way, that &s;ome times, after the whole family have lo&s;t a day, their gains do not amount to two-pence.</P>
<P>As Giles had a far greater ta&s;te for living by his wits, than his work, he was at one time in hopes, that his children might have a got a pretty penny by tumbling for the diver&s;ion of travellers, and he &s;et about training them in that indecent practice; but unluckily, the Moors being level, the carriages travelled fa&s;ter than the children tumbled. He en|vied tho&s;e parents who lived on the London road, over the Wilt&s;hire Downs, which being very hilly, enables the tumbler to keep pace with the traveller, till he &s;ometimes extorts from the light and the un|thinking a reward in&s;tead of a reproof. I beg leave, however, to put all gentlemen and ladies in mind that &s;uch tricks are a kind of apprentice&s;hip to the trades of begging and thieving.</P>
<P>Giles, to be &s;ure, as his children grew older, began to train them to &s;uch other employments as the idle habits they had learned at the gate very properly qualified them for. The right of Common, which &s;ome of the poor Cottagers have in that part
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of the country, and which is doubtle&s;s a con&s;ider|able advantage to many, was converted by Giles into the means of corrupting his whole family, for his children, as &s;oon as they grew too big for the trade of begging at the gate, were promoted to the dignity of thieving on the Moor. Here he kept two or three a&s;&s;es, mi&s;erable beings, which, if they had the good fortune to e&s;cape an untimely death by &s;tarving, did not fail to meet with it by beating. Some of the bigge&s;t boys were &s;ent out with the&s;e lean and galled animals to carry &s;and or coals about the neighbouring towns. Both &s;and and coals were often &s;tolen before they got them to &s;ell, or if not, they always took care to cheat in &s;elling them. By long practice in this art, they grew &s;o dextrous, that they could give a pretty good gue&s;s how large a coal they could crib out of every bag before the buyer would be likely to mi&s;s it.</P>
<P>All their odd time was taken up under the pre|tence of watching the&s;e a&s;&s;es on the Moor, or run|ning after five or &s;ix half-&s;tarved gee&s;e: but the truth is, the&s;e boys were only watching for an op|portunity to &s;teal an odd goo&s;e of their neighbour's. They u&s;ed al&s;o to pluck the quills or the down from the&s;e poor live creatures, or half milk a cow before the farmer's maid came with her pall. They all knew how to calculate to a minute what time to be down in a morning to let out their lank, hun|gry bea&s;ts, which they had turned over night into the farmer's field to &s;teal a little good pa&s;ture. They contrived to get there ju&s;t time enough to e&s;cape being caught in replacing the &s;takes they had pulled out for the cattle to get over. For Giles was a pru|dent long-headed fellow, and wherever he &s;tole food for his colts, took care never to &s;teal &s;takes
<PB N="7" REF="6">
from the hedges at the &s;ame time. He had &s;en&s;e enough to know that the gain did not make up for the danger; he knew that a loo&s;e faggot, pulled from a neighbour's pile of wood after the family were gone to bed, an&s;wered the end better, and was not half the trouble.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Among the many trades which Giles profe&s;&s;ed, he &s;ometimes practi&s;ed that of a rat catcher; but he was addicted to &s;o many tricks that he never fol|lowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ame trade long. Whenever he was &s;ent for to a farm-hou&s;e, his cu&s;tom was to kill a few of the old rats, always taking care to leave a little &s;tock of young ones alive &s;ufficient to keep up the breed; for, &s;aid he, "If I were to be &s;uch a fool as to clear a hou&s;e or a barn at once, how world my trade be carried on?" And where any barn was over&s;tocked, he u&s;ed to borrow a few from thence ju&s;t to people a neighbouring granary which had none; and he might have gone on till now, had he not unluckily been caught one evening emptying his cage of young rats under Par&s;on Wil&s;on's barn-door.</P>
<P>This worthy Mini&s;ter, Mr. Wil&s;on, u&s;ed to pity the neglected children of Giles as much as he blamed the wicked parents. He one day picked up Dick,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
who was far the be&s;t of Giles's bad boys. Dick was loitering about in a field behind the Par&s;on's garden in &s;earch of a hen's ne&s;t, his mother having ordered him to bring home a few eggs that night by hook or by crook, as Giles was re&s;olved to have &s;ome pan|cakes for &s;upper, though he knew that eggs were a penny a-piece. Mr. Wil&s;on had long been de&s;irous of &s;natching &s;ome of this vagrant family from ruin, and his chief hopes were bent on Dick, as the lea&s;t hackneyed in knavery. He had once given him a new pair of &s;hoes, on his promi&s;ing to go to &s;chool next Sunday; but no &s;ooner had Rachel, the boy's mother, got the &s;hoes into her clutches, than &s;he pawned them for a bottle of gin, and ordered the boy to keep out of the Par&s;on's &s;ight, and to be &s;ure to play his marbles on Sundays for the future at the other end of the pari&s;h, and not near the Church|yard. Mr. Wil&s;on, however, picked up the boy once more, for it was not his way to de&s;pair of any body. Dick was ju&s;t going to take to his heels as u&s;ual for fear the old &s;tory of the &s;hoes &s;hould be brought forward; but finding he could not get off; what does he do but run into a little puddle of muddy water which lay between him and the Par&s;on, that the &s;ight of his naked feet might not bring on the dreaded &s;ubject. Now it happened that Mr. Wil&s;on was planting a little field of beans, &s;o he thought, this a good opportunity to employ Dick; he told him he had got &s;ome pretty ea&s;y work for him. Dick did as he was bid; he willingly went to work, and readily began to plant his beans with di&s;patch and regularity, according to the directions given him.</P>
<P>While the boy was bu&s;ily at work by him&s;elf, Giles happened to come by having been &s;kulking
<PB N="9" REF="8">
round the back way to look over the Par&s;on's garden wall, to &s;ee if there was any thing worth climbing over for, on the en&s;uing night. He &s;pied Dick, and began to rate him for working for the &s;tingy old Par&s;on, for Giles had a natural antipathy to whatever belonged to the Church. "What has he promi&s;ed thee a day?" &s;aid he, "little enough I dare &s;ay." "He is not to pay me by the day," &s;aid Dick, "but &s;ays he will give me &s;o much when I have planted this peck, and &s;o much for the next." "Oh, oh! that alters the ca&s;e," &s;aid Giles. "One may, in|deed, get a trifle by this &s;ort of work. Come, give me a handful of the beans. I will teach thee how to plant when them art paid for planting by the peck. All we have to do in that ca&s;e is to di&s;patch the work as fa&s;t as we can, and get rid of the beans with all &s;peed; and as to the &s;eed coming up or not, that is no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours; we are paid for planting, not for growing. At the rate thou goe&s;t on thou would'&s;t not get &s;ix-pence to-night. Come along, bury away." So &s;aying, he took his hatful of the &s;eed, and where Dick had been ordered to &s;et one bean, Giles buried a dozen. So the beans were &s;oon out. But though the peck was emptied, the ground was unplanted. But cunning Giles knew this could not be found out till the time when the beans might be expected to come up, "and then Dick," &s;aid he, "the &s;nails and the mice may go &s;hares in the blame; or we can lay the fault on the rooks or the blackbirds." So &s;aying, he &s;ent the boy into the Par&s;onage to receive his pay, taking care to &s;ecure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bout a quarter of the peck of beans for his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; he put both bag and beans into his own pocket <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o carry home, bidding Dick tell Mr.
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Wil&s;on that he had planted the beans and lo&s;t the bag.</P>
<P>In the mean time Giles's other boys were bu&s;y in emptying the ponds and trout-&s;treams in the neighbouring manor. They would &s;teal away the carp and tench when they were no bigger than gudgeons; by this untimely depredation they plun|dered the owner of his property, without enrich|ing them&s;elves. But the plea&s;ure of mi&s;chief was reward enough. The&s;e, and a hundred other lit|tle thieveries, they committed with &s;uch dexterity, that old Tim Crib, who&s;e &s;on was tran&s;ported la&s;t a&s;&s;izes for &s;heep &s;tealing, u&s;ed to be often reproach|ing his boys, that Giles's &s;ons were worth a hun|dred of &s;uch blockheads as he had; for &s;carce a night pa&s;t but Giles had &s;ome little comfortable thing for &s;upper which his boys had pilfered in the day, while <HI>his</HI> undutiful dogs never &s;tole any thing worth having. Giles, in the mean time, was bu&s;y in his way, but as bu&s;y as he was in laying nets, &s;tarting coveys, and training dogs, he always took care that his depredations &s;hould not he con|fined merely to game.</P>
<P>Giles's boys had never &s;een the in&s;ide of a church &s;ince they were chri&s;tened, and the father thought he knew his own intere&s;t better than to force them to it; for church-time was the &s;ea&s;on of their har|ve&s;t. Then the hens' ne&s;ts were &s;earched, a &s;tray duck was clapped under the &s;mock frock, the tools which might have been left by cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in a farm-yard were picked up, and all the neighbour|ing pigeon-hou&s;es were thinned, &s;o that Giles u&s;ed to boa&s;t to his wife, that Sunday was to them the mo&s;t profitable day in the week. With her it was certainly the mo&s;t laborious day, as &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> always did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wa&s;hing and ironing on the Sunda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> morning, it
<PB N="11" REF="10">
being, as &s;he &s;aid the only lei&s;ure day, &s;he had, for on the other days &s;he went about the country telling fortunes, and &s;elling dreams books, and wicked &s;ongs. Neither her hu&s;band's nor her children's cloaths were ever mended, and if Sunday, her idle day, had not come about once in every week, it is likely they would never have been wa&s;hed nei|ther. You might, however, &s;ee her as you were going to church &s;moothing her own rags on her be&s;t red cloak, which &s;he always u&s;ed for her iron|ing cloth on Sundays, for her cloak when &s;he tra|velled, and for her blanket at night; &s;uch a wretched manager was Rachel! among her other articles of trade one was to make and &s;ell pepper|mint, and other di&s;tilled waters. The&s;e &s;he had the cheap art of making without trouble, and with|out expence, for &s;he made them without herbs and without a &s;till. Her way was, to fill &s;o many quart bottles with plain water, putting a &s;poonful of mint water in the mouth of each; the&s;e &s;he corked down with ro&s;in, carrying to each cu&s;tomer a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hial of real di&s;tilled water to ta&s;te, by way of &s;ample. This was &s;o good that her bottles were commonly bought up without being opened; but if any &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e and &s;he was forced to un|cork <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bottle, by the few drops of di&s;tilled water lying at top, &s;he even then e&s;caped detection, and took care to get out of reach before the bottle was opened a &s;econd time. She was too prudent ever to go twice to the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There is hardly any petty mi&s;chief that is not connected with the life of a poacher. Mr. Wil&s;on was aware of this, he was not only a pious clergy|man, but an upright ju&s;tice. He u&s;ed to &s;ay that people w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o were truly con&s;cientious, mu&s;t be &s;o
<PB N="12" REF="11">
in &s;mall things as well as in great ones, or they would de&s;troy the effect of their own precepts, and their example would not be of general u&s;e. For this rea&s;on he never would accept of a hare or a partridge from any unqualified per&s;on in his pari&s;h. He did not content him&s;elf with &s;huffling the thing off by a&s;king no que&s;tions, and pretending to take it for granted in a general way that the game was fairly come at; but he u&s;ed to &s;ay that by receiv|ing the booty he connived at a crime; made him|&s;elf a &s;harer in it, and if he gave a pre&s;ent to the man who brought it, he even tempted him to re|peat the fault.</P>
<P>One day poor Jack We&s;ton, an hone&s;t fellow in the neighbourhood, whom Mr. Wil&s;on had kindly vi&s;ited and relieved in a long &s;ickne&s;s, from which he has but ju&s;t recovered, was brought before him as he was &s;itting on the Ju&s;tice's bench; Jack was accu&s;ed of having knocked down a bare, and of all the birds in the air, who &s;hould the informer be but black Giles the poacher? Mr. Wil&s;on was grieved at the charge, be had a great regard for Jack, but he had a &s;till greater regard for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w. The poor fellow pleaded guilty. He did not deny the fact, but &s;aid he did not con&s;ider it a crime, he did not think game was private property, and he owned he had a &s;trong temptation for doing what he had done, which he hoped would plead in his excu&s;e. The Ju&s;tice de &s;ired to know what this temptation was. "Sir," &s;aid the poor fellow, "you know I was given over this &s;pring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a bad fever. I had no friend in the world but you Sir, Under God you &s;aved my life by your charitable relief; and I tru&s;t al&s;o you may have helped to &s;ave my &s;oul by your prayers and your good ad|vice.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
I know I can never make you amends for all your goodne&s;s, but I thought it would be &s;ome comfort to my full heart if I could but once give you &s;ome little token of my gratitude. So I had trained a pair of nice turtle doves for Madam Wil&s;on, but they were &s;tolen from me Sir, and I do &s;u&s;pect black Giles &s;tole them. Ye&s;terday morn|ing, Sir, and was crawling out to my work, for I am &s;till but very weak, a fine hare ran acro&s;s my path. I did not &s;tay to con&s;ider whether it was wrong to kill a hare, but I felt it was right to &s;hew my gratitude; &s;o Sir, without a moment's thought I did knock down the hare which I was going to car|ry to your Wor&s;hip, becau&s;e I knew Madam was fond of hare. I am truly &s;orry for my fault, and will &s;ubmit to whatever puni&s;hment your Wor&s;hip may plea&s;e to inflict."</P>
<P>Mr. Wil&s;on was much moved with this hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, and touched with the poor fellow's gra|titude. What added to the effect of the &s;tory, was the weak condition and pale &s;ickly looks of the of|fender. But this worthy Ju&s;tice never &s;uffered his feelings to bias his integrity; he know that he did not &s;it on that bench to indulge pity, but to admi|ni&s;ter ju&s;tice. And while he was &s;orry for the of|fender he would not ju&s;tify the offence. "John," &s;aid he, "I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you could for a mo|ment forget that I never accept any gift which cau&s;es the giver to break a law. On Sunday I teach you from the pulpit the laws of God, who&s;e mini&s;ter I am. At pre&s;ent I fill the chair of the magi&s;trate, to enforce and execute the laws of the land. Between tho&s;e and the others there is more connexion than you are aware. I thank you, John, for your affection to me, and I admire your grati|tude;
<PB N="14" REF="13">
but I mu&s;t not allow either affection or gra|titude to be brought as a plea for a wrong action. It is not your bu&s;ine&s;s nor mine, John, to &s;ettle whether the game laws are good or bad. Till they are repealed we mu&s;t obey them. Many, I doubt not, break tho&s;e laws through ignorance, and many I am certain, who would not dare to &s;teal a goo&s;e or a turkey, make no &s;cruple to knock down a hare or a partridge. You will hereafter think your&s;elf happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at this your fir&s;t attempt has proved un|&s;ucce&s;sful, as I tru&s;t you are too hone&s;t a fellow ever to intend to turn poacher. With poaching much moral evil is connected; a habit of nightly depradation; a cu&s;tom of prowling in the dark for prey, produces in time a di&s;reli&s;h for hone&s;t labour. He who&s;e fir&s;t offence was committed without much thought or evil intention, if he happen to &s;ucceed a few times in carrying off his booty undi&s;covered, grows bolder and bolder; and when he fancies there is no &s;hame attending it, he very &s;oon gets to per&s;uade him&s;elf that there is al&s;o no &s;in. While &s;ome people pretend a &s;cruple about &s;tealing a &s;heep, they partly live by plundering of warrens. But remember that the warrener pays a high rent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that therefore his rabbits are as much his pro|perty as his &s;heep. Do not then deceive your&s;elves with the&s;e fal&s;e di&s;tinctions. All property is &s;acred, and as the laws of the land are intended to fence in that property, he who brings up his children to break down any of the&s;e fences, brings them up to certain &s;in and ruin. He who begins with rob|bing orchards, rabbit warrens, and fi&s;h-ponds, will probably end with hor&s;e-&s;tealing or highway rob|bery. Poaching is a regular apprentice&s;hip to bolder crimes. He whom I may commit as a boy
<PB N="15" REF="14">
to &s;it in the &s;tocks for killing a partride, may be likely to end at the gallows for killing a man.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, you who now hear me, the &s;trictne&s;s and impartiality of ju&s;tice. I know Giles to be a worthle&s;s fellow, yet it is my duty to take his in|formation; I know Jack We&s;ton to be an hone&s;t youth, yet I mu&s;t be obliged to make him pay the penalty. Giles is a bad man, but he can prove this fact; Jack is a worthy lad, but he has com|mitted this fault, I am &s;orry for you, Jack; but do not let it grieve you that Giles has played wor&s;e tricks a hundred times, and yet got off, while you were detected in the very fir&s;t offence, for that would be grieving becau&s;e you are not &s;o great a rogue as Giles. At this moment you think your good luck is very unequal: but all this will one day turn out in your favour. Giles is not the more a favourite of heaven becau&s;e he has hitherto e&s;caped Botany Bay or the Hulks; nor is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> mark of God's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t you, John, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> you were found out in your very fir&s;t attempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
