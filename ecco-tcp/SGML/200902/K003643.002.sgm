<HEAD>LECTURE XVIII. FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE&mdash;GENE|RAL CHARACTERS OF STYLE&mdash;DIFFUSE, CONCISE&mdash;FEEBLE, NERVOUS&mdash;DRY, PLAIN, NEAT, ELEGANT, FLOWERY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated, at con&s;iderable length, of the Figures of Speech, of their origin, of their nature, and of the management of &s;uch of them as are import|ant enough to require a particular di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, before finally di&s;mi&s;&s;ing this &s;ubject, I think it incumbent on me, to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations concerning the proper u&s;e of Figurative Language in general. The&s;e, indeed, I have, in part, already anticipat|ed. But, as great errors are often commit|ted in this part of Style, e&s;pecially by young writers, it may be of u&s;e that I bring together, under one view, the mo&s;t mate|rial directions on this head.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
I BEGIN with repeating an ob&s;ervation, formerly made, that neither all the beau|ties, nor even the chief beauties of compo|&s;ition, depend upon Tropes and Figures. Some of the mo&s;t &s;ublime and mo&s;t pathetic pa&s;&s;ages of the mo&s;t admired authors, both in pro&s;e and poetry, are expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;imple Style, without any figure at all; in&s;tances of which I have before given. On the other hand, a compo&s;ition may abound with the&s;e &s;tudied ornaments; the language may be artful, &s;plendid, and highly figured, and yet the compo&s;ition be on the whole frigid and unaffecting. Not to &s;peak of &s;entiment and thought, which con&s;titute the real and la&s;ting merit of any work, if the &s;tyle be &s;tiff and affected, if it be deficient in per&s;picuity or preci&s;ion, or in ea&s;e and neatne&s;s, all the Figures that can be employed will never render it agree|able: they may dazzle a vulgar, but will never plea&s;e a judicious, eye.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, Figures, in order to be beautiful, mu&s;t always ri&s;e naturally from the &s;ubject. I have &s;hown that all of them are the language either of Imagina|tion, or of Pa&s;&s;ion; &s;ome of them &s;ugge&s;t|ed by Imagination, when it is awakened and &s;prightly, &s;uch as Metaphors and Com|pari&s;ons; others by Pa&s;&s;ion or more heat|ed emotion, &s;uch as Per&s;onifications and Apo&s;trophes. Of cour&s;e they are beauti|ful then only, when they are prompted by
<PB N="3" REF="6">
fancy, or by pa&s;&s;ion. They mu&s;t ri&s;e of their own accord; they mu&s;t flow from a mind warmed by the object which it &s;eeks to de&s;cribe; we &s;hould never interrupt the cour&s;e of thought to ca&s;t about for Figures. If they be fought after coolly, and fa&s;tened on as de&s;igned ornaments, they will have a mi&s;erable effect. It is a very erroneous idea, which many have of the ornaments of Style, as if they were things detached from the &s;ubject, and that could be &s;tuck to it, like lace upon a coat: this is indeed,
<Q><L>Purpureus late qui &s;plendeat unus aut alter</L>
<L>A&s;&s;uitur pannus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Shreds of purple with broad lu&s;tre &s;hine,</L>
<L>"Sew'd on your poem."</L>
<BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>ARS POET.</BIBL></Q>
And it is this fal&s;e idea which has often brought attention to the beauties of writ|ing into di&s;repute. Whereas, the real and proper ornaments of Style are wrought into the &s;ub&s;tance of it. They flow in the &s;ame &s;tream with the current of thought. A writer of genius conceives his &s;ubject &s;trongly; his imagination is filled and im|pre&s;&s;ed with it; and pours it&s;elf forth in that Figurative Language which Imagina|tion naturally &s;peaks He puts on no emo|tion which his &s;ubject does not rai&s;e in him; he &s;peaks as he feels; but his &s;tyle will be beautiful, becau&s;e his feelings are lively. On occa&s;ions, when fancy is lan|guid,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
or finds nothing to rou&s;e it, we &s;hould never attempt to hunt for figures. We then work, as it is &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"invit&acirc; Minerv&acirc;;"</Q> &s;uppo&s;ing figures invented, they will have the appearance of being forced; and in this ca&s;e, they had much better be wanted.</P>
<P>In the third place, even when Imagina|tion prompts, and the &s;ubject naturally gives ri&s;e to Figures, they mu&s;t, however, not be employed too frequently. In all beauty, <Q REND="inline">"&s;implex munditiis;"</Q> is a capital quality. Nothing derogates more from the weight and dignity of any compo&s;ition, than too great attention to ornament. When the ornaments co&s;t labour, that la|bour always appears; though they &s;hould co&s;t us none, &s;till the reader or hearer may be &s;urfeited with them; and when they come too thick, they give the impre&s;&s;ion of a light and frothy genius, that evapo|rates in &s;hew, rather than brings forth what is &s;olid. The directions of the ancient critics, on this head, are full of good &s;en&s;e, and de&s;erve careful attention. <Q REND="inline">"Volup|tatibus maximis,"</Q> &s;ays Cicero, de Orat. L. iii. <Q REND="inline">"fa&s;tidium finitimum e&s;t in rebus omnibus; quo hoc minus in oratione miremur. In qua vel ex po&euml;tis, vel oratoribus po&s;&s;umus judicare, concin|nam, ornatam, fe&s;tivam &s;ine intermi&s;|&s;ione, quamvis claris &s;it coloribus picta, vel po&euml;&s;is, vel oratio, non po&s;&s;e in de|lectatione e&s;&s;e diuturn&acirc;. Quare, bene
<PB N="5" REF="8">

From reading either poets or orators we may ea&s;ily &s;atisfy our&s;elves, that neither a poem nor an oration, which, without intermi&s;&s;ion is &s;howy and &s;parkling, can plea&s;e us long.&mdash;Wherefore, though we may wi&s;h for the frequent prai&s;e of having expre&s;&s;ed our&s;elves well and properly, we &s;hould not covet repeated applau&s;e, for being bright and &s;plendid."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e, are the excellent directions with which Quinctilian concludes his di&s;cour&s;e concerning Figures, L. ix. C. 3. <Q REND="inline">"Ego illud de iis figuris quae vere fiunt, adjiciam breviter, &s;icut or|nant orationem opportunae po&s;itae, ita inepti&s;&s;imas e&s;&s;e cum immodice petuntur. Sunt, qui neglecto rerum pondere et viri|bus &s;ententiarum, &s;i vel inania verba in hos modos depravarunt, &s;ummos &s;e ju|dicant artifices; ideoque non de&s;inunt eas nectere; quas &s;ine &s;ententia &s;ectare, tam e&s;t ridiculum quam quaerere habitum ge&s;tumque &s;ine corpore. Ne hae quidem quae rectae fiunt, den&s;andae &s;unt nimis. Sciendum imprimis quid qui&s;que po&s;tu|let locus, quid per&s;ona, quid tempus. Major enim pars harum figurarum po&s;ita e&s;t in delectatione. Ubi ver&ograve;, atrocitate, invidi&acirc;, mi&s;eratione pugnandum e&s;t; quis ferat verbis contrapo&s;itis, et con&s;i|milibus, &amp; pariter cadentibus, ira&s;cen|tem, flentem, rogantem?

<PB N="6" REF="9">
abe&s;&s;e videatur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t add, concerning tho&s;e figures which are proper in them&s;elves, that as they beautify a compo&s;ition when they are &s;ea&s;onably introduced, &s;o they deform it greatly, if too frequently &s;ought after. There are &s;ome, who, ne|glecting &s;trength of &s;entiment and weight of matter, if they can only force their empty words into a Figurative Style, imagine them&s;elves great writers; and therefore continually &s;tring together &s;uch ornaments; which is ju&s;t as ridiculous, where there is no &s;entiment to &s;upport them, as to contrive ge&s;tures and dre&s;&s;es for what wants a body. Even tho&s;e figures which a &s;ubject admits, mu&s;t not come too thick. We mu&s;t begin, with con&s;idering what the occa&s;ion, the time, and the per&s;on who &s;peaks, render proper. For the object aimed at by the greater part of the&s;e figures, is en|tertainment. But when the &s;ubject becomes deeply &s;erious and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions are to be moved, who can bear the ora|tor, who, in affected language and balanced phra&s;es, en|deavours to expre&s;s wrath, commi&s;eration, or earne&s;t in|treaty? On all &s;uch occa&s;ions, a &s;olicitous attention to words weaken pa&s;&s;ion; and when &s;o much art is &s;hown, there is &s;u&s;pected to be little &s;incerity."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> After the&s;e judicious and u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, I have no more to add, on this &s;ubject, except this admonition.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, that without a ge|nius for Figurative Language, none &s;hould attempt it. Imagination is a power not to be acquired; it mu&s;t be derived from na|ture. Its redundancies we may prune, its deviations we may correct, its &s;phere we may enlarge; but the faculty it&s;elf we cannot create: and all efforts towards a metaphorical ornamented &s;tyle, if we are de&s;titute of the proper genius for it, will prove awkward and di&s;gu&s;ting. Let us &s;atisfy our&s;elves, however, by con&s;ider|ing, that without this talent, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="10">
with a very &s;mall mea&s;ure of it, we may both write and &s;peak to advantage. Good &s;en&s;e, clear ideas, per&s;picuity of language, and proper arrangement of words and thoughts, will always command attention. The&s;e are indeed the foundations of all &s;olid merit, both in &s;peaking and writing. Many &s;ubjects require nothing more; and tho&s;e which admit of ornament, admit it only as a &s;econdary requi&s;ite. To &s;tudy and to know our own genius well; to fol|low nature; to &s;eek to improve, but not to force it, are directions which cannot be too often given to tho&s;e who de&s;ire to excell in the liberal arts.</P>
<P>WHEN I entered on the con&s;ideration of Style, I ob&s;erved that words being the co|pies of our ideas, there mu&s;t always be a very intimate connection between the manner in which every writer employs words, and his manner of thinking; and that, from the peculiarity of thought and expre&s;&s;ion which belongs to him, there is a certain character imprinted on his Style, which may be denominated his manner; commonly expre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch general terms, as &s;trong, weak, dry, &s;imple, affected, or the like. The&s;e di&s;tinctions carry, in ge|neral, &s;ome reference to an author's man|ner of thinking, but refer chiefly to his mode of expre&s;&s;ion. They ari&s;e from the whole tenour of his language; and com|prehend the effect produced by all tho&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="11">
parts of Style which we have already con|&s;idered; the choice which he makes of &s;ingle words; his arrangement of the&s;e in &s;entences; the degree of his preci&s;ion; and his embelli&s;hment, by means of mu&s;ical ca|dence, figures, or other arts of &s;peech. Of &s;uch general Characters of Style, therefore, it remains now to &s;peak, as the re&s;ult of tho&s;e underparts of which I have hitherto treated.</P>
<P>THAT different &s;ubjects require to be treated of in different &s;orts of Style, is a po&s;ition &s;o obvious, that I &s;hall not &s;tay to illu&s;trate it. Every one &s;ees that Treati&s;es of Philo&s;ophy, for in&s;tance, ought not to be compo&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;tyle with ora|tions. Every one &s;ees al&s;o, that different parts of the &s;ame compo&s;ition require a va|riation in the &s;tyle and manner. In a &s;er|mon, for in&s;tance, or any harangue, the application or peroration admits more or|nament, and requires more warmth, than the didactic part. But what I mean at pre&s;ent to remark is, that amid&s;t this va|riety, we &s;till expect to find, in the com|po&s;itions of any one man, &s;ome degree of uniformity or con&s;i&s;tency with him&s;elf in manner; we expect to find &s;ome predomi|nant character of Style impre&s;&s;ed on all his writings, which &s;hall be &s;uited to, and &s;hall mark, his particular genius, and turn of mind. The orations in Livy differ much in Style, as they ought to do, from the re&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="12">
of his hi&s;tory. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e in Tacitus. Yet both in Livy's ora|tions, and in tho&s;e of Tacitus, we are able clearly to trace the di&s;tingui&s;hing manner of each hi&s;torian; the magnificent fullne&s;s of the one, and the &s;ententious conci&s;ene&s;s of the other. The "Lettres Per&s;anes," and "L'E&s;prit de Loix," are the works of the &s;ame author. They required very dif|ferent compo&s;ition &s;urely, and accordingly they differ widely; yet &s;till we &s;ee the &s;ame hand. Wherever there is real and native ge|nius, it gives a determination to one kind of Style rather than another. Where no|thing of this appears; where there is no marked nor peculiar character in the com|po&s;itions of any author, we are apt to in|fer, not without rea&s;on, that he is a vul|gar and trivial author, who writes from imitation, and not from the impul&s;e of original genius. As the mo&s;t celebrated painters are known by their hand, &s;o the be&s;t and mo&s;t original writers are known and di&s;tingui&s;hed, throughout all their works, by their Style and peculiar man|ner. This will be found to hold almo&s;t without exception.</P>
<P>THE ancient Critics attended to the&s;e general characters of Style which we are now to con&s;ider. Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;|&s;us divides them into three kinds; and calls them the Au&s;tere, the Florid, and the Middle. By the Au&s;tere, he means a Style
<PB N="10" REF="13">
di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;trength and firmne&s;s, with a neglect of &s;moothne&s;s and orna|ment; for examples of which, he gives Pindar and Ae&s;chylus among the Poets, and Thucydides among the Pro&s;e writers. By the Florid, he means, as the name indi|cates, a Style ornamented, flowing, and &s;weet; re&s;ting more upon numbers and grace, than &s;trength; he in&s;tances He&s;iod, Sappho, Anacreon, Euripides, and princi|pally I&s;ocrates. The Middle kind is the ju&s;t mean between the&s;e, and comprehends the beauties of both; in which cla&s;s he places Homer and Sophocles among the Poets; in Pro&s;e, Herodotus, Demo&s;thenes, Plato, and (what &s;eems &s;trange) Ari&s;totle. This mu&s;t be a very wide cla&s;s indeed, which comprehends Plato and Ari&s;totle un|der one article as to Style<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Compo&s;itione Verborum, Cap. 25.</NOTE>. Cicero and Quinctilian make al&s;o a threefold divi&s;ion of Style, though with re&s;pect to different qualities of it; in which they are followed by mo&s;t of the modern writers on Rheto|ric; the <HI>Simplex, Tenue,</HI> or <HI>Subtile;</HI> the <HI>Grave</HI> or <HI>Vehemens;</HI> and the <HI>Medium,</HI> or, <HI>temperatum genus dicendi.</HI> But the&s;e divi|&s;ions, and the illu&s;trations they give of them, are &s;o loo&s;e and general, that they cannot advance us much in our ideas of Style. I &s;hall endeavour to be a little more particular in what I have to &s;ay on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
ONE of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious di&s;tinc|tions of the different kinds of Style, is what ari&s;es from an author's &s;preading out his thoughts more or le&s;s. This di&s;tinction forms, what are called the Diffu&s;e and the Conci&s;e Styles. A conci&s;e writer com|pre&s;&s;es his thought into the fewe&s;t po&s;&s;ible words; he &s;eeks to employ none but &s;uch as are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive; he lops off, as re|dundant, every expre&s;&s;ion which does not add &s;omething material to the &s;en&s;e. Or|nament he does not reject; he may be lively and figured; but his ornament is in|tended for the &s;ake of force, rather than grace. He never gives you the &s;ame thought twice. He places it in the light which appears to him the mo&s;t &s;triking; but if you do not apprehend it well in that light, you need not expect to find it in any other. His &s;entences are arranged with compactne&s;s and &s;trength, rather than with cadence and harmony. The utmo&s;t pre|ci&s;ion is &s;tudied in them; and they are commonly de&s;igned to &s;ugge&s;t more to the reader's imagination than they directly expre&s;s.</P>
<P>A DIFFUSE writer unfolds his thought fully. He places it in a variety of lights, and gives the reader every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance for under&s;tanding it completely. He is not very careful to expre&s;s it at fir&s;t in its full &s;trength; becau&s;e he is to repeat the impre&s;&s;ion; and what he wants in
<PB N="12" REF="15">
&s;trength, he propo&s;es to &s;upply by copiou&s;|ne&s;s. Writers of this character generally love magnificence and amplification. Their periods naturally run out into &s;ome length, and having room for ornament of every kind, they admit it freely.</P>
<P>EACH of the&s;e manners has its peculiar advantages; and each becomes faulty when carried to the extreme. The extreme of conci&s;ene&s;s becomes abrupt and ob&s;cure; it is apt al&s;o to lead into a Style too point|ed, and bordering on the epigrammatic. The extreme diffu&s;ene&s;s becomes weak and languid, and tires the reader. However, to one or other of the&s;e two manners, a writer may lean according as his genius prompts him: and under the general cha|racter of a conci&s;e, or of a more open and diffu&s;e Style, may po&s;&s;e&s;s much beauty in his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>FOR illu&s;trations of the&s;e general cha|racters, I can only refer to the writers who are examples of them. It is not &s;o much from detached pa&s;&s;ages, &s;uch as I was wont formerly to quote for in&s;tances, as from the current of an author's Style, that we are to collect the idea of a formed manner of writing. The two mo&s;t remarkable ex|amples that I know, of conci&s;ene&s;s carried as far as propriety will allow, perhaps in &s;ome ca&s;es farther, are Tacitus the Hi&s;to|rian, and the Pre&s;ident Monte&s;quieu in
<PB N="13" REF="16">
"L'E&s;prit de Loix." Ari&s;totle too holds an eminent rank among didactic wri|ters for his brevity. Perhaps no writer in the world was ever &s;o frugal of his words as Ari&s;totle; but this frugality of expre&s;|&s;ion frequently darkens his meaning. Of a beautiful and magnificent diffu&s;ene&s;s, Ci|cero is, beyond doubt, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious in&s;tance that can be given. Addi&s;on al&s;o, and Sir William Temple, come in &s;ome de|gree under this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>IN judging when it is proper to lean to the conci&s;e, and when to the diffu&s;e man|ner, we mu&s;t be directed by the nature of the Compo&s;ition. Di&s;cour&s;es that are to be &s;poken, require a more copious Style, than books that are to be read. When the whole meaning mu&s;t be catched from the mouth of the &s;peaker, without the advantage which books afford of pau&s;ing at plea&s;ure, and reviewing what appears ob&s;cure, great conci&s;ene&s;s is always to be avoided. We &s;hould never pre&s;ume too much on the quickne&s;s of our hearer's under&s;tanding; but our Style ought to be &s;uch, that the bulk of men can go along with us ea&s;ily, and without effort. A flowing copious Style, therefore, is required in all public &s;peakers; guarding, at the &s;ame time, again&s;t &s;uch a degree of diffu&s;ion, as ren|ders them languid and tire&s;ome; which will always prove the ca&s;e, when they
<PB N="14" REF="17">
inculcate too much, and pre&s;ent the &s;ame thought under too many different views.</P>
<P>IN written Compo&s;itions, a certain degree of conci&s;ene&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great advantages. It is more lively; keeps up attention; makes a bri&s;ker and &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion; and gratifies the mind by &s;upplying more exerci&s;e to a reader's own thought. A &s;en|timent, which, expre&s;&s;ed diffu&s;ely, will barely be admitted to be ju&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed conci&s;ely, will be admired as &s;pirited. De&s;cription, when we want to have it vi|vid and animated, &s;hould be in a conci&s;e &s;train. This is different from the common opinion; mo&s;t per&s;ons being ready to &s;up|po&s;e, that upon de&s;cription a writer may dwell more &s;afely than upon other things, and that by a full and extended Style, it is rendered more rich and expre&s;&s;ive. I ap|prehend, on the contrary, that a diffu&s;e manner generally weakens it. Any redun|dant words or circum&s;tances encumber the fancy, and make the object we pre&s;ent to it, appear confu&s;ed and indi&s;tinct. Ac|cordingly, the mo&s;t ma&s;terly de&s;cribers, Homer, Tacitus, Milton, are almo&s;t always conci&s;e in their de&s;criptions. They &s;hew us more of an object at one glance, than a feeble diffu&s;e writer can &s;how, by turning it round and round in a variety of lights. The &s;trength and vivacity of de&s;cription, whether in pro&s;e or poetry, depend much more upon the happy choice of one or two
<PB N="15" REF="18">
&s;triking circum&s;tances, than upon the mul|tiplication of them.</P>
<P>ADDRESSES to the pa&s;&s;ions, likewi&s;e, ought to be in the conci&s;e, rather than the diffu&s;e manner. In the&s;e, it is dangerous to be diffu&s;e, becau&s;e it is very difficult to &s;upport proper warmth for any length of time. When we become prolix, we are always in hazard of cooling the reader. The heart, too, and the fancy run fa&s;t; and if once we can put them in motion, they &s;upply many particulars to greater advantage than an author can di&s;play them. The ca&s;e is different, when we addre&s;s our|&s;elves to the under&s;tanding; as in all mat|ters of rea&s;oning, explication, and in&s;truc|tion. There I would prefer a more free and diffu&s;e manner. When you are to &s;trike the fancy, or to move the heart, be conci&s;e; when you are to inform the un|der&s;tanding, which moves more &s;lowly, and requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a guide, it is bet|ter to be full. Hi&s;torical narration may be beautiful, either in a conci&s;e or diffu&s;e manner, according to the writer's genius. Livy and Herodotus are diffu&s;e; Thucy|dides and Sallu&s;t are &s;uccinct; yet all of them agreeable.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED that a diffu&s;e &s;tyle inclines mo&s;t to long periods; and a conci&s;e writer, it is certain, will often employ &s;hort &s;en|tences. It is not, however, to be inferred
<PB N="16" REF="19">
from this, that long or &s;hort &s;entences are fully characteri&s;tical of the one or the other manner. It is very po&s;&s;ible for one to com|po&s;e always in &s;hort &s;entences, and to be withal extremely diffu&s;e, if a &s;mall mea&s;ure of &s;entiment be &s;pread through many of the&s;e &s;entences. Seneca is a remarkable example. By the &s;hortne&s;s and quaintne&s;s of his &s;entences, he may appear at fir&s;t view very conci&s;e; yet he is far from being &s;o. He transfigures the &s;ame thought into many different forms. He makes it pa&s;s for a new one, only by giving it a new turn. So al&s;o, mo&s;t of the French writers compo&s;e in &s;hort &s;entences; though their &s;tyle, in general, is not conci&s;e; common|ly le&s;s &s;o than the bulk of Engli&s;h writers, who&s;e &s;entences are much longer. A French author breaks down into two or three &s;en|tences, that portion of thought which an Engli&s;h author crowds into one. The di|rect effect of &s;hort &s;entences, is to render the Style bri&s;k and lively, but not always con|ci&s;e. By the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ive impul&s;es which they make on the mind, they keep it awake; and give to Compo&s;ition more of a &s;pirited character. Long periods, like Lord Clarendon's are grave and &s;tately; but, like all grave things, they are in ha|zard of becoming dull. An intermixture of both long and &s;hort ones is requi&s;ite, when we would &s;upport &s;olemnity, toge|ther with vivacity; leaning more to the one or the other, according as propriety
<PB N="17" REF="20">
requires, that the &s;olemn or the &s;prightly &s;hould be predominant in our compo&s;ition. But of long and &s;hort &s;entences, I had occa&s;ion, formerly, to treat under the head of the con&s;truction of periods.</P>
<P>THE Nervous and the Feeble, are gene|rally held to be characters of Style, of the &s;ame import with the Conci&s;e and the Dif|fu&s;e. They do indeed very often coincide. Diffu&s;e writers have for the mo&s;t part &s;ome degree of feeblene&s;s; and nervous writers will generally be inclined to a conci&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ion. This, however, does not always hold; and there are in&s;tances of writers, who, in the mid&s;t of a full and ample Style, have maintained a great degree of &s;trength. Livy is an example; and in the Engli&s;h lan|guage, Dr. Barrow. Barrow's Style has many faults. It is unequal, incorrect and redundant; but withal, for force and ex|pre&s;&s;ivene&s;s uncommonly di&s;tingui&s;hed. On every &s;ubject, he multiplies words with an overflowing copiou&s;ne&s;s; but it is always a torrent of &s;trong ideas and &s;ignificant ex|pre&s;&s;ions which he pours forth. Indeed, the foundations of a nervous or a weak Style are laid in an author's manner of think|ing. If he conceives an object &s;trongly, he will expre&s;s it with energy: but, if he has only an indi&s;tinct view of his &s;ubject; if his ideas be loo&s;e and wavering; if his ge|nius be &s;uch, or, at the time of his writ|ing, &s;o carele&s;sly exerted, that he has no
<PB N="18" REF="21">
firm hold of the conception which he would communicate to us; the marks of this will clearly appear in his Style. Several un|meaning words and loo&s;e epithets will be found; his expre&s;&s;ions will be vague and general; his arrangement indi&s;tinct and feeble; we &s;hall conceive &s;omewhat of his meaning, but our conception will be faint. Whereas a nervous writer, whether he em|ploys an extended or a conci&s;e Style, gives us always a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of his mean|ing; his mind is full of his &s;ubject, and his words are all expre&s;&s;ive; every phra&s;e and every figure which he u&s;es, tends to render the picture, which he would &s;et be|fore us, more lively and complete.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED, under the head of Diffu&s;e and Conci&s;e Style, that an author might lean either to the one or to the other, and yet be beautiful. This is not the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the nervous and the feeble. Eve|ry author, in every compo&s;ition, ought to &s;tudy to expre&s;s him&s;elf with &s;ome &s;trength, and, in proportion, as he approaches to the feeble, he becomes a bad writer. In all kinds of writing, however, the &s;ame de|gree of &s;trength is not demanded. But the more grave and weighty any compo&s;ition is, the more &s;hould a character of &s;trength predominate in the Style. Hence in hi&s;to|ry, philo&s;ophy, and &s;olemn di&s;cour&s;es, it is expected mo&s;t. One of the mo&s;t com|plete
<PB N="19" REF="22">
models of a nervous Style, is Demo&s;t|henes in his orations.</P>
<P>AS every good quality in Style has an extreme, when pur&s;ued to which it be|comes faulty, this holds of the Nervous Style as well as others. Too great a &s;tudy of &s;trength, to the neglect of the other qualities of Style, is found to betray writers into a har&s;h manner. Har&s;hne&s;s ari&s;es from unu&s;ual words, from forced inver&s;ions in the con&s;truction of a Sentence, and too much neglect of &s;moothne&s;s and ea&s;e. This is reckoned the fault of &s;ome of our earli|e&s;t cla&s;&s;ics in the Engli&s;h language; &s;uch as Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Bacon, Hooker, Chillingworth, Milton in his pro&s;e works, Harrington, Cudworth, and other writers of con&s;iderable note in the days of Queen Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. The&s;e writers had nerves and &s;trength in a high degree, and are to this day eminent for that quality in Style. But the language in their hands was exceedingly different from what it is now, and was indeed entirely formed upon the idiom and con&s;truction of the Latin in the arrangement of Sentences. Hooker, for in&s;tance, begins the Preface to his celebrated work of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, with the following Sentence: <Q REND="inline">"Though for no other cau&s;e, yet for this, that po&s;te|rity may know we have not loo&s;ely, through &s;ilence, permitted things to pa&s;s away as in dream, there &s;hall be, for
<PB N="20" REF="23">
men's information, extant this much, concerning the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church of God e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us, and their careful endeavours which would have upheld the &s;ame."</Q> Such a &s;entence now &s;ounds har&s;h in our ears. Yet &s;ome ad|vantages certainly attended this &s;ort of Style; and whether we have gained, or lo&s;t, upon the whole, by departing from it, may bear a que&s;tion. By the freedom of arrangement, which it permitted, it ren|dered the Language &s;u&s;ceptible of more &s;trength, of more variety of collocation, and more harmony of period. But howe|ver this be, &s;uch a &s;tyle is now ob&s;olete; and no modern writer could adopt it with|out the cen&s;ure of har&s;hne&s;s and affecta|tion. The pre&s;ent form which the Lan|guage has a&s;&s;umed, has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;acrificed the &s;tudy of &s;trength to that of per&s;picutiy and ea&s;e. Our arrangement of words has become le&s;s forcible, perhaps, but more plain and natural: and this is now under&s;tood to be the genius of our Language.</P>
<P>THE re&s;toration of King Charles II. &s;eems to be the aera of the formation of our pre&s;ent &s;tyle. Lord Clarendon was one of the fir&s;t who laid a&s;ide tho&s;e fre|quent inver&s;ions which prevailed among writers of the former age. After him, Sir William Temple, poli&s;hed the Language &s;till more. But the author, who, by the
<PB N="21" REF="24">
number and reputation of his works, formed it more than any one, into its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is Dryden. Dryden began to write at the Re&s;toration, and continued long an author both in poetry and pro&s;e. He had made the language his &s;tudy; and though he wrote ha&s;tily, and often incorrectly, and his &s;tyle is not free from faults, yet there is a richne&s;s in his diction, a copiou&s;ne&s;s, ea&s;e, and variety in his expre&s;&s;ion, which has not been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any who have come after him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on, in his life of Dryden, gives the following character of his pro&s;e &s;tyle: <Q REND="inline">"His prefaces have not the for|mality of a &s;ettled &s;tyle, in which the fir&s;t half of the &s;en|tence betrays the other. The clau&s;es are never balanced, nor the periods modelled; every word &s;eems to drop by chance, though it falls into its proper place. Nothing is cold or languid; the whole is airy, animated, and vigor|ous; what is little, is gay; what is great, is &s;plendid. Though all is ea&s;y, nothing is feeble; though all &s;eems carele&s;s, there is nothing har&s;h; and though, &s;ince his earlier works, more than a century has pa&s;&s;ed, they have nothing yet uncouth or ob&s;olete."</Q></NOTE>. Since his time, con&s;ide|rable attention has been paid to Purity and Elegance of Style: But it is Elegance, ra|ther than Strength, that forms the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing quality of mo&s;t of the good En|gli&s;h writers. Some of them compo&s;e in a more manly and nervous manner than others; but, whether it be from the genius of our Language, or from whatever other cau&s;e, it appears to me, that we are far from the &s;trength of &s;everal of the Greek and Roman authors.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">
HITHERTO we have con&s;idered Style un|der tho&s;e characters that re&s;pect its expre&s;|&s;ivene&s;s of an author's meaning. Let us now proceed to con&s;ider it in another view, with re&s;pect to the degree of ornament employed to beautify it. Here, the Style of different authors &s;eems to rai&s;e, in the following gradation: a Dry, a Plain, a Neat, an Elegant, a Flowery manner. Of each of the&s;e in their order.</P>
<P>FIRST, a Dry manner. This excludes all ornament of every kind. Content with being under&s;tood, it has not the lea&s;t aim to plea&s;e, either the fancy or the ear. This is tolerable only in pure didactic writ|ing; and even there, to make us bear it, great weight and &s;olidity of matter is re|qui&s;ite; and entire per&s;picuity of Lan|guage. Ari&s;totle is the thorough example of a Dry Style. Never, perhaps, was there any author who adhered &s;o rigidly to the &s;trictne&s;s of a didactic manner, through|out all his writings, and conveyed &s;o much in&s;truction without the lea&s;t approach to ornament. With the mo&s;t profound geni|us, and exten&s;ive views, he writes like a pure intelligence, who addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;ole|ly to the under&s;tanding, without making any u&s;e of the channel of the imagination. But this is a manner which de&s;erves not to be imitated. For, although the goodne&s;s of the matter may compen&s;ate the dryne&s;s or har&s;hne&s;s of the Style, yet is that dryne&s;s a con&s;iderable defect; as it fatigues attenti|on,
<PB N="23" REF="26">
and conveys our &s;entiments, with di&s;ad|vantage, to the reader or hearer.</P>
<P>A PLAIN Style ri&s;es one degree above a Dry one. A writer of this character, em|ploys very little ornament of any kind, and re&s;ts, almo&s;t, entirely upon his &s;en&s;e. But, if he is at no pains to engage us by the em|ployment of figures, mu&s;ical arrangement, or any other art of writing, he &s;tudies, how|ever, to avoid di&s;gu&s;ting us like a dry and a har&s;h writer. Be&s;ides Per&s;picuity, he pur|&s;ues Propriety, Purity, and Preci&s;ion, in his Language; which form one degree, and no incon&s;iderable one, of beauty. Liveline&s;s too, and force, may be con&s;i&s;tent with a very Plain Style: and, therefore, &s;uch an author, if his &s;entiments be good, may be abun|dantly agreeable. The difference between a dry and plain writer, is, that the former is incapable of ornament, and &s;eems not to know what it is; the latter &s;eeks not after it. He gives us his meaning, in good lan|guage, di&s;tinct and pure; any further orna|ment he gives him&s;elf no trouble about; ei|ther, becau&s;e he thinks it unnece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ubject; or, becau&s;e his genius does not lead him to delight in it; or, becau&s;e it leads him to de&s;pi&s;e it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this head, of the General Characters of Style, par|ticularly, the Plain and the Simple, and the characters of tho&s;e Engli&s;h authors who are cla&s;&s;ed under them, in this, and the following Lecture, &s;everal ideas have been taken from a manu&s;cript treati&s;e on rhetoric, part of which was &s;hewn to me, many years ago, by the learned and ingenious author, Dr. Adam Smith; and which, it is hoped, will be given by him to the Public.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">
THIS la&s;t was the ca&s;e with Dean Swift, who may be placed at the head of tho&s;e that have employed the Plain Style. Few writ|ers have di&s;covered more capacity. He treats every &s;ubject which he handles, whether &s;e|rious or ludicrous, in a ma&s;terly manner. He knew, almo&s;t, beyond any man, the Pu|rity, the Extent, the Preci&s;ion of the En|gli&s;h Language; and, therefore, to &s;uch as wi&s;h to attain a pure and correct Style, he is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful models. But we mu&s;t not look for much ornament and grace in his Language. His haughty and moro&s;e genius, made him de&s;pi&s;e any embelli&s;h|ment of this kind as beneath his dignity. He delivers his &s;entiments in a plain, down|right, po&s;itive manner, like one who is &s;ure he is in the right; and is very indifferent whether you be plea&s;ed or not. His &s;entences are com|monly negligently arranged; di&s;tinctly e|nough as to the &s;en&s;e; but, without any regard to &s;moothne&s;s of &s;ound; often without much regard to compactne&s;s, or elegance. If a metaphor, or any other figure, chanced to render his &s;atire more poignant, he would, perhaps, vouch&s;afe to adopt it, when it came in his way; but if it tended only to embel|li&s;h and illu&s;trate, he would rather throw it a&s;ide. Hence, in his &s;erious pieces, his &s;tyle often borders upon the dry and unplea&s;ing; in his humourous ones, the plainne&s;s of his
<PB N="25" REF="28">
manner gives his wit a &s;ingular edge, and &s;ets it off to the highe&s;t advantage. There is no froth, nor affectation in it; it flows without any &s;tudied preparation; and while he hardly appears to &s;mile him&s;elf, he makes his reader laugh heartily. To a writer of &s;uch a genius as Dean Swift, the Plain Style was mo&s;t admirably fitted. Among our phi|lo&s;ophical writers, Mr. Locke comes under this cla&s;s; per&s;picuous and pure, but almo&s;t without any ornament whatever. In works which admit, or require, ever &s;o much or|nament, there are parts where the plain manner ought to predominate. But we mu&s;t remember, that when this is the cha|racter which a writer affects throughout his whole compo&s;ition, great weight of matter, and great force of &s;entiment, are required, in order to keep up the reader's attention, and prevent him from tiring of the author.</P>
<P>WHAT is called a Neat Style comes next in order; and here we are got into the re|gion of ornament; but that ornament not of the highe&s;t or mo&s;t &s;parkling kind. A writer of this character &s;hows, that he does not de&s;pi&s;e the beauty of Language. It is an object of his attention. But his atten|tion is &s;hown in the choice of his words, and in a graceful collocation of them; ra|ther than in any high efforts of imaginati|on, or eloquence. His &s;entences are al|ways clean, and free from the incumbrance of &s;uperfluous words; of a moderate
<PB N="26" REF="29">
length; rather inclining to brevity, than a &s;welling &s;tructure; clo&s;ing with propriety; without any tails, or adjections dragging after the proper clo&s;e. His cadence is va|ried; but not of the &s;tudied mu&s;ical kind. His figures, if he u&s;es any, are &s;hort and correct; rather than bold and glowing. Such a Style as this, may be attained by a writer who has no great powers of fancy or genius; by indu&s;try merely, and careful attention to the rules of writing; and it is a Style always agreeable. It imprints a character of moderate elevation on our compo&s;ition, and carries a decent degree of ornament, which is not un&s;uitable to any &s;ubject whatever. A familiar letter, or a law paper, on the drie&s;t &s;ubject, may be written with neatne&s;s; and a &s;ermon, or a philo&s;ophical treati&s;e, in a Neat Style, will be read with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>AN Elegant Style is a character, expre&s;|&s;ing a higher degree of ornament than a neat one; and, indeed, is the term u&s;ually applied to Style, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the vir|tues of ornament, without any of its ex|ce&s;&s;es or defects. From what has been formerly delivered, it will ea&s;ily be under|&s;tood, that complete Elegance implies great per&s;picuity and propriety; purity in the choice of words, and care and dexterity in their harmonious and happy arrangement. It implies, farther, the grace and beauty of Imagination &s;pread over Style, as far as the
<PB N="27" REF="30">
&s;ubject admits it; and all the illu&s;tration which Figurative Language adds, when properly employed. In a word, an elegant writer is one who plea&s;es the fancy and the ear, while he informs the under&s;tanding; and who gives us his ideas clothed with all the beauty of expre&s;&s;ion, but not over|charged with any of its mi&s;placed finery. In this cla&s;s, therefore, we place only the fir&s;t rate writers in the Language; &s;uch as, Addi&s;on, Dryden, Pope, Temple, Boling|broke, Atterbury, and a few more: writers who differ widely from one another in ma|ny of the attributes of Style, but whom we now cla&s;s together, under the denomi|nation of Elegant, as in the &s;cale of Or|nament, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing nearly the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>WHEN the ornaments, applied to Style, are too rich and gaudy in proportion to the &s;ubject; when they return upon us too fa&s;t, and &s;trike us either with a dazzling lu&s;tre, or a fal&s;e brilliancy, this forms what is call|ed a Florid Style; a term commonly u&s;ed to &s;ignify the exce&s;s of ornament. In a young compo&s;er this is very pardonable. Perhaps, it is even a promi&s;ing &s;ymptom in young people, that their Style &s;hould in|cline to the Florid and Luxuriant: <Q REND="inline">"Volo &s;e efferat in adole&s;cente faecunditas,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"multum inde decoquent an|ni, multum ratio limabit, aliquid velut u&s;u ip&s;o deteretur; &s;it modo unde excidi poffit quid et exculpi.&mdash;Audeat haec aetas
<PB N="28" REF="31">
plura, et inveniat et inventis gaudeat; &s;int licet illa non &s;atis interim &s;icca et &s;e|vera. Facile remedium e&s;t ubertatis: &s;terilia nullo labore vincuntur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"In youth, I wi&s;h to &s;ee luxuriancy of fancy appear. Much of it will be dimini&s;hed by years; much will be cor|rected by ripening judgment; &s;ome of it, by the mere practice of compo&s;ition, will be worn away. Let there be only &s;ufficient matter, at fir&s;t, that can hear &s;ome pruning and lopping off. At this time of life, let genius be bold and inventive, and pride it&s;elf in its efforts, though the&s;e &s;hould not, as yet, be correct. Luxuriancy can ea&s;ily be cured; but for barrenne&s;s there is no remedy."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> But, although the Florid Style may be allowed to youth, in their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays, it mu&s;t not receive the &s;ame indulgence from writers of maturer years. It is to be expected, that judgment, as it ripens, &s;hould cha&s;ten ima|gination, and reject, as juvenile, all &s;uch ornaments as are redundant, un&s;uitable to the &s;ubject, or not conducive to illu&s;trate it. Nothing can be more contemptible than that tin&s;el &s;plendor of Language, which &s;ome writers perpetually affect. It were well, if this could be a&s;cribed to the real overflowing of a rich imagination. We &s;hould then have &s;omething to amu&s;e us, at lea&s;t, if we found little to in&s;truct us. But the wor&s;t is, that with tho&s;e frothy writers, it is a luxuriancy of words, not of fancy. We &s;ee a laboured attempt to ri&s;e to a &s;plendour of compo&s;ition, of which they have formed to them&s;elves &s;ome loo&s;e idea; but having no &s;trength of geni|us for attaining it, they endeavour to &s;up|ply 
<PB N="29" REF="32">
the defect by poetical words, by cold exclamations, by common place figures, and every thing that has the appearance of pomp and magnificence. It has e&s;caped the&s;e writers, that &s;obriety in ornament, is one great &s;ecret for rendering it plea&s;ing; and that, without a foundation of good &s;en&s;e and &s;olid thought, the mo&s;t Florid Style is but a childi&s;h impo&s;ition on the Public. The Public, however, are but too apt to be &s;o impo&s;ed on; at lea&s;t, the mob of Readers, who are very ready to be caught, at fir&s;t, with whatever is dazzling and gaudy.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help thinking, that it reflects more honour on the religious turn, and good di&s;po&s;itions of the pre&s;ent age, than on the public ta&s;te, that Mr. Harvey's Me|ditations have had &s;o great a currency. The pious and benevolent heart, which is always di&s;played in them, and the lively fancy which, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, appears, ju&s;tly merited applau&s;e: but the perpetual glitter of expre&s;&s;ion, the &s;woln imagery, and &s;trained de&s;cription which abound in them, are ornaments of a fal&s;e kind. I would, therefore, advi&s;e &s;tudents of ora|tory to imitate Mr. Harvey's piety, rather than his Style; and, in all compo&s;itions of a &s;erious kind, to turn their attention, as Mr. Pope &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"from &s;ounds to things, from fancy to the heart."</Q> Admonitions of this kind, I have already had occa&s;ion
<PB N="30" REF="33">
to give, and may hereafter repeat them; as I conceive nothing more incumbent on me in this cour&s;e of Lectures, than to take every opportunity of cautioning my Read|ers again&s;t the affected and frivolous u&s;e of ornament; and, in&s;tead of that &s;light and &s;uperficial ta&s;te in writing, which I appre|hend to be at pre&s;ent too fa&s;hionable, to introduce, as far as my endeavours can avail, a ta&s;te for more &s;olid thought, and more manly &s;implicity in Style.</P>

<P>HAVING entered in the la&s;t Lec|ture on the con&s;ideration of the ge|neral Characters of Style, I treated of the conci&s;e and diffu&s;e, the nervous and feeble manner. I con&s;idered Style al&s;o, with re|lation to the different degrees of ornament employed to beautify it; in which view, the manner of different authors ri&s;es ac|cording to the following gradation: Dry, Plain, Neat, Elegant, Flowery.</P>
<P>I AM next to treat of Style under ano|ther character, one of great importance in writing, and which requires to be accu|rately examined, that of Simplicity, or a Natural Style, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from Affec|tation. Simplicity, applied to writing, is
<PB N="32" REF="35">
a term very frequently u&s;ed; but, like ma|ny other critical terms often u&s;ed loo&s;ely, and without preci&s;ion. This has been ow|ing chiefly to the different meanings given to the word Simplicity, which, therefore, it will be nece&s;&s;ary here to di&s;tingui&s;h; and to &s;hew in what &s;en&s;e it is a proper attri|bute of Style. We may remark four dif|ferent acceptations in which it is taken.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, Simplicity of Compo&s;ition, as oppo&s;ed to too great a variety of parts. Horace's precept refers to this:
<Q><L>Denique &s;it quod vis &s;implex duntaxat et unum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Then learn the wand'ring humour to controul,</L>
<L>"And keep one equal renor through the whole."</L>
<BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS is the Simplicity of plan in a tra|gedy, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from double plots, and crowded incidents; the Simplicity of the Iliad, or Aeneid, in oppo&s;ition to the digre&s;&s;ions of Lucan, and the &s;cattered tales of Ario&s;to; the Simplicity of Grecian architecture, in oppo&s;ition to the irregular variety of the Gothic. In this &s;en&s;e, Sim|plicity is the &s;ame with Unity.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;en&s;e is, Simplicity of Thought, as oppo&s;ed to Refinement. Sim|ple thoughts are what ari&s;e naturally; what
<PB N="33" REF="36">
the occa&s;ion, or the &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;t un|&s;ought; and what, when once &s;ugge&s;ted, are ea&s;ily apprehended by all. Refinement in writing, expre&s;&s;es a le&s;s natural and ob|vious train of thought, and which it re|quired a peculiar turn of genius to pur|&s;ue; within certain bounds very beautiful; but when carried too far, approaching to intricacy, and hurting us by the appear|ance of being <HI>recherch&egrave;,</HI> or far &s;ought. Thus, we would naturally &s;ay, that Mr. Parnell is a poet of far greater Simplicity, in his turn of thought, than Mr. Cowley: Cicero's thoughts on moral &s;ubjects are na|tural; Seneca's too refined and laboured. In the&s;e two &s;en&s;es of Simplicity, when it is oppo&s;ed, either to variety of parts, or to refinement of thought, it has no proper relation to Style.</P>
<P>THERE is a third &s;en&s;e of Simplicity, in which it has re&s;pect to Style; and &s;tands oppo&s;ed to too much ornament, or pomp of Language; as when we &s;ay, Mr. Locke is a &s;imple, Mr. Harvey a florid, writer; and it is in this &s;en&s;e, that the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;implex,</HI>"</Q> the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>tenue,</HI>"</Q> or <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;ubtile genus dicendi,</HI>"</Q> is under&s;tood by Cicero and Quinctilian. The Simple Style, in this &s;en&s;e, coincides with the Plain or the Neat Style, which I before mentioned; and, therefore, requires no farther illu&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">
BUT there is a fourth &s;en&s;e of Simplici|ty, al&s;o re&s;pecting Style; but not re&s;pecting the degree of ornament employed, &s;o much as the ea&s;y and natural manner in which our Language expre&s;&s;es our thoughts. This is quite different from the former &s;en&s;e of the word ju&s;t now mentioned, in which Simplicity was equivalent to Plainne&s;s: whereas, in this &s;en&s;e, it is compatible with the highe&s;t ornament. Homer, for in|&s;tance, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this Simplicity in the great|e&s;t perfection; and yet no writer has more Ornament and Beauty. This Simplicity, which is what we are now to con&s;ider, &s;tands oppo&s;ed, not to Ornament, but to Affectation of Ornament, or appearance of labour about our Style; and it is a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing excellency in writing.</P>
<P>A WRITER of Simplicity expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that every one thinks he could have written in the &s;ame way; Horace de&s;cribes it,
<Q><L>&mdash;ut &s;ibi quivis</L>
<L>Speret idem, &s;udet multum, fru&s;traque laboret</L>
<L>Au&s;us idem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"From well-known tales &s;uch fictions would I rai&s;e,</L>
<L>"As all might hope to imitate with ea&s;e;</L>
<L>"Yet, while they &s;trive the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s to gain,</L>
<L>"Should find their labours, and their hopes in vain."</L>
<BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q> <PB N="35" REF="38">
There are no marks of art in his expre&s;&s;i|on; it &s;eems the very language of nature; you &s;ee in the Style, not the writer and his labour, but the man, in his own natural character. He may be rich in his expre&s;&s;i|on; he may be full of figures, and of fan|cy; but the&s;e flow from him without ef|fort; and he appears to write in this man|ner, not becau&s;e he has &s;tudied it, but be|cau&s;e it is the manner of expre&s;&s;ion mo&s;t natural to him. A certain degree of neg|ligence, al&s;o, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with this character of Style, and even not ungrace|ful in it; for too minute an attention to words is foreign to it: <Q REND="inline">"Habeat ille,"</Q> &s;ays Cicero, (Orat. No. 77.) <Q REND="inline">"molle quiddam, et quod indicet non ingratam negligenti|am hominis, de re magis qu&agrave;m de verbo laborantis.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Let this Style have a certain &s;oftne&s;s and ea&s;e, which &s;hall characteri&s;e a negligence, not unplea&s;ing in an author, who appears to be more &s;olicitous about the thought than the expre&s;&s;ion."</Q></NOTE>"</Q> This is the great advan|tage of Simplicity of Style, that, like &s;im|plicity of manners, it &s;hows us a man's &s;en|timents and turn of mind laid open with|out di&s;gui&s;e. More &s;tudied and artificial manners of writing, however beautiful, have always this di&s;advantage, that they exhibit an author in form, like a man at court, where the &s;plendour of dre&s;s, and the ceremonial of behaviour, conceal tho&s;e peculiarities which di&s;tingui&s;h one man from another. But reading an author of
<PB N="36" REF="39">
Simplicity, is like conver&s;ing with a per&s;on of di&s;tinction at home, and with ea&s;e, where we find natural manners, and a marked character.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t degree of this Simplicity, is expre&s;&s;ed by a French term, to which we have none that fully an&s;wers in our Lan|guage, <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;.</HI> It is not ea&s;y to give a pre|ci&s;e idea of the import of this word. It always expre&s;&s;es a di&s;covery of character. I believe the be&s;t account of it is given by a French critic, M. Marmontel, who ex|plains it thus: That &s;ort of amiable inge|nuity, or undi&s;gui&s;ed openne&s;s, which &s;eems to give us &s;ome degree of &s;uperiority over the per&s;on who &s;hows it; a certain in|fantine Simplicity, which we love in our hearts, but which di&s;plays &s;ome features of the character that we think we could have art enough to hide; and which, there|fore; always leads us to &s;mile at the per&s;on who di&s;covers this character. La Fontaine, in his Fables, is given as the great exam|ple of &s;uch <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;.</HI> This, however, is to be under&s;tood, as de&s;criptive of a particu|cular &s;pecies only of Simplicity.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to Simplicity, in general, we may remark, that the antient original writers are always the mo&s;t eminent for it. This happens from a plain rea&s;on, that they wrote from the dictates of natural genius, and were not formed upon the labours and
<PB N="37" REF="40">
writings of others, which is always in ha|zard of producing Affectation. Hence, among the Greek writers, we have more models of a beautiful Simplicity than among the Roman. Homer, He&s;iod, Anacreon, Theocritus, Herodotus, and Xenophon, are all di&s;tingui&s;hed for it. Among the Ro|mans al&s;o, we have &s;ome writers of this character, particularly Terence, Lucreti|us, Phoedrus, and Julius Cae&s;ar. The fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age of Terence's Andria, is a beautiful in&s;tance of Simplicity of man|ner in de&s;cription:
<Q><L>Funus interim Procedit; &s;equimur; ad &s;epulchrum veni|mus;</L>

All the words here are remarkably happy and elegant; and convey a mo&s;t lively pic|ture of the &s;cene de&s;cribed: while, at the &s;ame time, the Style appears wholly artle&s;s and unlaboured. Let us, next, con&s;ider &s;ome Engli&s;h writers who come under this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>SIMPLICITY is the great beauty of Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on's manner. Tillot&s;on has long been admired as an eloquent writ|er, and a model for preaching. But his eloquence, if we can call it &s;uch, has been often mi&s;under&s;tood. For, if we include, in the idea of eloquence, vehemence and &s;trength, picture&s;que de&s;cription, glowing figures, or correct arrangement of &s;entenc|es, in all the&s;e parts of oratory the Arch|bi&s;hop is exceedingly deficient. His Style is always pure, indeed, and per&s;picuous, but carele&s;s and remi&s;s, too often feeble and languid; little beauty in the con&s;truc|tion 
<PB N="39" REF="42">
of his &s;entences, which are frequently &s;uffered to drag unharmoniou&s;y; &s;eldom any attempt towards &s;trength or &s;ublimity. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e defects, &s;uch a con&s;tant vein of good &s;en&s;e and piety runs through his works, &s;uch an earne&s;t and &s;e|rious manner, and &s;o much u&s;eful in&s;truc|tion conveyed in a Style &s;o pure, natural, and unaffected, as will ju&s;tly recommend him to high regard, as long as the Engli&s;h Language remains; not, indeed, as a mo|del of the highe&s;t eloquence, but as a &s;im|ple and amiable writer, who&s;e manner is &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of great goodne&s;s and worth. I ob&s;erved before, that Simplicity of manner may be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome de|gree of negligence in Style; and it is only the beauty of that Simplicity which makes the negligence of &s;uch writers &s;eem grace|ful. But, as appears in the Archbi&s;hop, negligence may &s;ometimes be carried &s;o far as to impair the beauty of Simplicity, and make it border on a flat and languid man|ner.</P>
<P>SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE is another re|markable writer in the Style of Simplicity. In point of ornament and correctne&s;s, he ri&s;es a degree above Tillot&s;on; though, for correctne&s;s, he is not in the highe&s;t rank. All is ea&s;y and flowing in him; he is ex|ceedingly harmonious; &s;moothne&s;s, and what may be called amaenity, are the di&s;|tingui&s;hing characters of his manner; re|laxing,
<PB N="40" REF="43">
&s;ometimes, as &s;uch a manner will naturally do, into a prolix and remi&s;s Style. No writer whatever has &s;tamped upon his Style a more lively impre&s;&s;ion of his own character. In reading his works, we &s;eem engaged in conver&s;ation with him; we be|come thoroughly acquainted with him, not merely as an author, but as a man; and contract a friend&s;hip for him. He may be cla&s;&s;ed as &s;tanding in the middle, between a negligent Simplicity, and the highe&s;t de|gree of Ornament, which this character of Style admits.</P>
<P>OF the latter of the&s;e, the highe&s;t, mo&s;t correct, and ornamented degree of the &s;im|ple manner, Mr. Addi&s;on, is, beyond doubt, in the Engli&s;h Language, the mo&s;t perfect example: and, therefore, though not with|out &s;ome faults, he is, on the whole, the &s;afe&s;t model for imitation, and the free&s;t from con&s;iderable defects, which the Lan|guage affords. Per&s;picuous and pure he is in the highe&s;t degree; his preci&s;ion, indeed, not very great; yet nearly as great as the &s;ubjects which he treats of require: the con&s;truction of his &s;entences ea&s;y, agreea|ble, and commonly very mu&s;ical; carrying a character of &s;moothne&s;s, more than of &s;trength. In Figurative Language, he is rich; particularly, in &s;imilies and meta|phors; which are &s;o employed, as to ren|der his Style &s;plendid without being gaudy. There is not the lea&s;t Affectation in his
<PB N="41" REF="44">
manner; we &s;ee no marks of labour; no|thing forced or con&s;trained; but great ele|gance joined with great ea&s;e and &s;implicity. He is, in particular, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a character of mode&s;ty, and of politene&s;s, which appears in all his writings. No au|thor has a more popular and in&s;inuating manner; and the great regard which he every where &s;hews for virtue and religion, recommends him highly. If he fails in any thing, it is in want of &s;trength and preci|&s;ion, which renders his manner, though perfectly &s;uited to &s;uch e&s;&s;ays as he writes in the Spectator, not altogether a proper model for any of the higher and more ela|borate kinds of compo&s;ition. Though the public have ever done much ju&s;tice to his merit, yet the nature of his merit has not always been &s;een in its true light: for, though his poetry be elegant, he certainly bears a higher rank among the pro&s;e writ|ers, than he is intitled to among the poets; and, in pro&s;e, his humour is of a much higher, and more original &s;train, than his philo&s;ophy. The character of Sir Roger de Coverley di&s;covers more genius than the critique on Milton.</P>
<P>SUCH authors as tho&s;e, who&s;e characters I have been giving, one never tires of read|ing. There is nothing in their manner that &s;trains or fatigues our thoughts: we are plea&s;ed, without being dazzled by their lu&s;tre. So powerful is the charm of Sim|plicity
<PB N="42" REF="45">
in an author of real genius, that it attones for many defects, and reconciles us to many a carele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion. Hence, in all the mo&s;t excellent authors, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, the &s;imple and natural manner may be always remarked; although other beauties being predominant, this form not their peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racter. Thus Milton is &s;imple in the mid&s;t of all his grandeur; and Demo&s;thenes in the mid&s;t of all his vehemence. To grave and &s;olemn writings, Simplicity of man|ner adds the more venerable air. Accord|ingly, this has often been remarked as the prevailing character throughout all the &s;a|cred Scriptures: and indeed no other cha|racter of Style was &s;o much &s;uited to the dignity of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>OF authors, who, notwith&s;tanding ma|ny excellencies, have rendered their Style much le&s;s beautiful by want of Simplicity, I cannot give a more remarkable example than Lord Shaft&s;bury. This is an author on whom I have made ob&s;ervations &s;everal times before, and &s;hall now take leave of him, with giving his general character un|der this head. Con&s;iderable merit, doubt|le&s;s, he has. His works might be read with profit for the moral philo&s;ophy which they contain, had he not filled them with &s;o many oblique and invidious in&s;inuations again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion; thrown out, too, with &s;o much &s;pleen and &s;atire, as do
<PB N="43" REF="46">
no honour to his memory, either as an au|thor or a man. His language has many beauties. It is firm, and &s;upported in an uncommon degree: it is rich and mu&s;ical. No Engli&s;h author, as I formerly &s;hewed, has attended &s;o much to the regular con|&s;truction of his &s;entences, both with re&s;|pect to propriety, and with re&s;pect to ca|dence. All this gives &s;o much elegance and pomp to his language, that there is no wonder it &s;hould have been &s;ometimes high|ly admired. It is greatly hurt, however, by perpetual &s;tiffne&s;s and affectation. This is its capital fault. His lord&s;hip can ex|pre&s;s nothing with Simplicity. He &s;eems to have con&s;idered it as vulgar, and beneath the dignity of a man of quality, to &s;peak like other men. Hence he is ever in bu&s;|kins; full of circumlocutions and artificial elegance. In every &s;entence, we &s;ee the marks of labour and art; nothing of that ea&s;e, which expre&s;&s;es a &s;entiment coming natural and warm from the heart. Of fi|gures and ornament of every kind, he is exceedingly fond; &s;ometimes happy in them; but his fondne&s;s for them is too vi|&s;ible; and having once laid hold of &s;ome metaphor or allu&s;ion that plea&s;ed him, he knows not how to part with it. What is mo&s;t wonderful, he was a profe&s;&s;ed admirer of Simplicity; is always extolling it in the ancients, and cen&s;uring the moderns for the want of it; though he departs from it him&s;elf as far as any one modern whatever.
<PB N="44" REF="47">
Lord Shaft&s;bury po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed delicacy and re|finement of ta&s;te, to a degree that we may call exce&s;&s;ive and &s;ickly; but he had little warmth of pa&s;&s;ion; few &s;trong or vigorous feelings: and the coldne&s;s of his character led him to that artificial and &s;tately manner which appears in his writings. He was fonder of nothing than of wit and raille|ry; but he is far from being happy in it. He attempts it often, but always aukward|ly; he is &s;tiff, even in his plea&s;antry; and laughs in form, like an author, and not like a man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may perhaps be not unworthy of being mentioned, that the fir&s;t edition of his Enquiry into Virtue was publi&s;hed, &s;urreptitiou&s;ly, I believe, in a &s;eparate form, in the year 1699; and is &s;ometimes to be met with; by comparing which, with the corrected edition of the &s;ame treati&s;e, as it now &s;tands among his works, we &s;ee one of the mo&s;t curious and u&s;eful examples that I know, of what is called <HI>Limae labor;</HI> the art of poli&s;hing language, breaking long &s;entences, and working up an imperfect draught into a highly fini&s;hed performance.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM the account which I have given of Lord Shaft&s;bury's manner, it may ea&s;ily be imagined, that he would mi&s;lead many who blindly admired him. Nothing is more dangerous to the tribe of imitators, than an author, who, with many impo&s;ing beau|ties, has al&s;o &s;ome very con&s;iderable ble|mi&s;hes. This is fully exemplified in Mr. Blackwall of Aberdeen, the author of the Life of Homer, the Letters on Mytholo|gy, and the Court of Augu&s;tus; a writer of con&s;iderable learning, and of ingenuity
<PB N="45" REF="48">
al&s;o; but infected with an extravagant love of an artificial Style, and of that parade of language which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Shaft&s;bu|rean manner.</P>
<P>HAVING now &s;aid &s;o much to recom|mend Simplicity, or the ea&s;y and natural manner of writing, and having pointed out the defects of an oppo&s;ite manner; in or|der to prevent mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to ob&s;erve, that it is ve|ry po&s;&s;ible for an author to write &s;imply, and yet not beautifully. One may be free from affectation, and not have merit. The beautiful Simplicity &s;uppo&s;es an author to po&s;&s;e&s;s real genius; to write with &s;olidity, purity, and liveline&s;s of imagination. In this ca&s;e, the &s;implicity or unaffectedne&s;s of his manner, is the crowning ornament;" it heightens every other beauty; it is the dre&s;s of nature, without which, all beau|ties are imperfect. But if mere unaffect|edne&s;s were &s;ufficient to con&s;titute the beauty of Style, weak, trifling, and dull writers might often lay claim to this beau|ty. And, accordingly, we frequently meet with pretended critics, who extol the dull|e&s;t writers on account of what they call the <Q REND="inline">"Cha&s;te Simplicity of their manner;"</Q> which, in truth, is no other than the ab|&s;ence of every ornament, through the mere want of genius and imagination. We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h, therefore, between that Sim|plicity which accompanies true genius,
<PB N="46" REF="49">
and which is perfectly compatible with every proper ornament of Style, and that which is no other than a carele&s;s and &s;lo|venly manner. Indeed, the di&s;tinction is ea&s;ily made from the effect produced. The one never fails to intere&s;t the Reader; the other is in&s;ipid and tire&s;ome.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to mention one other manner or character of Style, different from any that I have yet &s;poken of; which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Vehe|ment. This always implies &s;trength; and is not, by any means, incon&s;i&s;tent with Simplicity: but in its predominant charac|ter is di&s;tingui&s;hable from either the &s;trong or the &s;imple manner. It has a peculiar ar|dour; it is a glowing Style; the language of a man, who&s;e imagination and pa&s;&s;ions are heated, and &s;trongly affected by what he writes; who is therefore negligent of le&s;&s;er graces, but pours him&s;elf forth with the rapidity and fulne&s;s of a torrent. It belongs to the higher kinds of oratory; and indeed is rather expected from a man who is &s;peaking, than from one who is writing in his clo&s;et. The orations of Demo&s;the|nes furni&s;h the full and perfect example of this &s;pecies of Style.</P>
<P>AMONG Engli&s;h writers, the one who has mo&s;t of this character, though mixed, indeed, with &s;everal defects, is Lord Bo|lingbroke. Bolingbroke was formed by na|ture
<PB N="47" REF="50">
to be a factious leader; the demagogue of a popular a&s;&s;embly. Accordingly, the Style that runs through all his political writings, is that of one declaiming with heat, rather than writing with deliberati|on. He abounds in Rhetorical Figures; and pours him&s;elf forth with great impe|tuo&s;ity. He is copious to a fault; places the &s;ame thought before us in many differ|ent views; but generally with life and ar|dour. He is bold, rather than correct; a torrent that flows &s;trong, but often muddy. His &s;entences are varied as to length and &s;hortne&s;s; inclining, however, mo&s;t to long periods, &s;ometimes including paren|the&s;es, and frequently crowding and heap|ing a multitude of things upon one ano|ther, as naturally happens in the warmth of &s;peaking. In the choice of his words, there is great felicity and preci&s;ion. In ex|act con&s;truction of &s;entences, he is much inferior to Lord Shaft&s;bury; but greatly &s;uperior to him in life and ea&s;e. Upon the whole, his merit, as a writer, would have been very con&s;iderable, if his matter had equalled his Style. But whil&s;t we find many things to commend in the latter, in the former, as I before remarked, we can hardly find any thing to commend. In his rea&s;onings, for mo&s;t part, he is flim&s;y and fal&s;e; in his political writings, factions; in what he calls his philo&s;ophical ones, ir|religious and &s;ophi&s;tical in the highe&s;t de|gree.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">
I SHALL in&s;i&s;t no longer on the different manners of Writers, or the general Charac|ters of Style. Some other, be&s;ides tho&s;e which I have mentioned, might be pointed out; but I am &s;en&s;ible, that it is very diffi|cult to &s;eparate &s;uch general con&s;iderations of the Style of authors from their peculiar turn of &s;entiment, which it is not my bu|&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to critici&s;e. Conceited Writers, for in&s;tance, di&s;cover their &s;pirit &s;o much in their compo&s;ition, that it imprints on their Style a character of pertne&s;s; though I confe&s;s it is difficult to &s;ay, whether this can be cla&s;&s;ed among the attributes of Style, or rather is to be a&s;cribed entirely to the thought. In whatever cla&s;s we rank it, all appearances of it ought to be avoided with care, as a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting blemi&s;h in writing. Under tho&s;e general heads, which I have con&s;idered, I have taken an opportunity of giving the character of many of the eminent cla&s;&s;ics in the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P>FROM what I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it may be inferred, that to determine among all tho&s;e different manners of writing, what is preci&s;ely the be&s;t, is neither ea&s;y, nor ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Style is a field that admits of great latitude. Its qualities in different authors may be very different; and yet in them all beautiful. Room mu&s;t be left here for ge|nius; for that particular determination which every one receives from nature to one man|ner of expre&s;&s;ion more than another. Some
<PB N="49" REF="52">
general qualities, indeed, there are of &s;uch importance, as &s;hould always, in every kind of compo&s;ition, be kept in view; and &s;ome defects we &s;hould always &s;tudy to avoid. An o&s;tentatious, a feeble, a har&s;h, or an ob&s;cure Style, for in&s;tance, are always faults; and Per&s;picuity, Strength, Neatne&s;s, and Sim|plicity, are beauties to be always aimed at. But as to the mixture of all, or the degree of predominancy of any one of the&s;e good qualities, for forming our peculiar di&s;tin|gui&s;hing manner, no preci&s;e rules can be given; nor will I venture to point out any one model as ab&s;olutely perfect.</P>
<P>IT will be more to the purpo&s;e, that I con|clude the&s;e di&s;&s;ertations upon Style, with a few directions concerning the proper method of attaining a good Style in general; leaving the particular character of that Style to be either formed by the &s;ubject on which we write, or prompted by the bent of genius.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t direction which I give for this purpo&s;e, is, to &s;tudy clear ideas on the &s;ub|ject concerning which we are to write or &s;peak. This is a direction which may at fir&s;t appear to have &s;mall relation to Style. Its relation to it, however, is extremely clo&s;e. The foundation of all good Style, is good &s;en&s;e accompanied with a lively imagi|nation. The Style and thoughts of a wri|ter are &s;o intimately connected, that, as I have &s;everal times hinted, it is frequently
<PB N="50" REF="53" MS="y">
hard to di&s;tingui&s;h them. Wherever the impre&s;&s;ions of things upon our minds are faint and indi&s;tinct, or perplexed and con|fu&s;ed, our Style in treating of &s;uch things will infallibly be &s;o too. Whereas what we conceive clearly and feel &s;trongly, we will naturally expre&s;s with clearne&s;s and with &s;trength. This, then, we may be a&s;|&s;ured, is a capital rule as to Style, to think clo&s;ely of the &s;ubject, till we have attained a full and di&s;tinct view of the matter which we are to clothe in words, till we become warm and intere&s;ted in it; then and not till then, &s;hall we find expre&s;&s;ion begin to flow. Generally &s;peaking, the be&s;t and mo&s;t proper expre&s;&s;ions, are tho&s;e which a clear view of the &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts, without much labour or enquiry after them. This is Quinctili|an's ob&s;ervation, Lib. viii. c. 1. <Q REND="inline">"Plerum|que optima verba rebus cohaerent, et cern|untur &s;uo lumine. At nos quaerimus illa, tanquam lateant &s;cque &s;ubducant. Ita nunquam putamus verba e&s;&s;a circa id de quo dicendum e&s;t; fed ex aliis locis peti|mus et inventis vim afferimus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"The mo&s;t proper words for the mo&s;t part adhere to the thoughts which are to be expre&s;&s;ed by them, and may be di&s;|covered as by their own light. But we hunt after them, as if they were hidden, and only to be found in a corner. Hence, in&s;tead of conceiving the words to lie near the &s;ubject, we go in que&s;t of them to &s;ome other quarter, and endeavour to give force to the expre&s;&s;ions we have found out."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, in order to form a good Style, the frequent practice of compo&s;|ing
<PB N="51" REF="54">
is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. Many rules concerning Style I have delivered; but no rules will an&s;wer the end without exerci&s;e and habit. At the &s;ame time, it is not every &s;ort of compo&s;ing that will improve Style. This is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that by frequent, carele&s;s, and ha&s;ty compo&s;ition, we &s;hall acquire certainly a very bad Style; we &s;hall have more trouble afterwards in un|learning faults, and correcting negligences, than if we had not been accu&s;tomed to com|po&s;ition at all. In the beginning therefore, we ought to write &s;lowly, and with much care. Let the facility and &s;peed of writing, be the fruit of longer practice. <Q REND="inline">"Moram et &s;olicitudinem,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian with the greate&s;t rea&s;on, L. x. c. 3, <Q REND="inline">initiis im|pero.

<P><PB N="52" REF="55">
WE mu&s;t ob&s;erve, however, that there may be an extreme, in too great and anxious a care about words. We mu&s;t not retard the cour&s;e of thought, nor cool the heat of imagination, by pau&s;ing too long on every word we employ. There is, on certain oc|ca&s;ions, a glow of compo&s;ition which &s;hould be kept up, if we hope to expre&s;s our&s;elves happily, though at the expence of allowing &s;ome inadvertencies to pa&s;s. A more &s;evere examination of the&s;e mu&s;t be left to be the work of correction. For, if the practice of compo&s;ition be u&s;eful, the laborious work of correcting is no le&s;s &s;o; is indeed ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to our reaping any benefit from the habit of compo&s;ition. What we have written, &s;hould be laid by for &s;ome little time, till the ardour of compo&s;ition be pa&s;t, till the fondne&s;s for the expre&s;&s;ions we have u&s;ed be worn off, and the expre&s;&s;ions them&s;elves be forgotten; and then review|ing our work with a cool and critical eye, as if it were the performance of another, we &s;hall di&s;cern many imperfections which at fir&s;t e&s;caped us. Then is the &s;ea&s;on for pruning redundancies; for weighing the ar|rangement of &s;entences; for attending to
<PB N="53" REF="56">
the juncture and connecting particles; and bringing Style into a regular, correct, and &s;upported form. This <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Limae Labor,</HI>"</Q> mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to by all who would commu|nicate their thoughts with proper advantage to others; and &s;ome practice in it will &s;oon &s;harpen their eye to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary ob|jects of attention, and render it a much more ea&s;y and practicable work than might atfir&s;t be imagined.</P>
<P>IN the third place, with re&s;pect to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that is to be gained from the writings of others, it is obvious, that we ought to render our&s;elves well acquainted with the Style of the be&s;t authors. This is requi&s;ite, both in order to form a ju&s;t ta&s;te in Style, and to &s;upply us with a full &s;tock of words on every &s;ubject. In reading au|thors, with a view to Style, attention &s;hould be given to the peculiarities of their differ|ent manners; and in this, and former Lec|tures, I have endeavoured to &s;ugge&s;t &s;everal things that may be u&s;eful in this view. I know no exerci&s;e that will be found more u&s;eful for acquiring a proper Style, than to tran&s;late &s;ome pa&s;&s;age from an eminent Eng|li&s;h author, into our own words. What I mean is, to take, for in&s;tance, &s;ome page of one of Mr. Addi&s;on's Spectators, and read it carefully over two or three times, till we have got a firm hold of the thoughts contained in it; then to lay a&s;ide the book; to attempt to write out the pa&s;&s;age from
<PB N="54" REF="57">
memory, in the be&s;t way we can; and hav|ing done &s;o, next to open the book, and compare what we have written, with the Style of the author. Such an exerci&s;e will, by compari&s;on, &s;hew us where the defects of our Style lie; will lead us to the proper attentions for rectifying them; and, among the different ways in which the &s;ame thought may be expre&s;&s;ed, will make us perceive that which is the mo&s;t beautiful. But,</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, I mu&s;t caution, at the &s;ame time, again&s;t a &s;ervile imitation of any one author whatever. This is always dangerous. It hampers genius; it is likely to produce a &s;tiff manner; and tho&s;e who are given to clo&s;e imitation, generally imi|tate an author's faults as well as his beauties. No man will ever become a good writer, or &s;peaker, who has not &s;ome degree of confi|dence to follow his own genius. We ought to beware, in particular, of adopting any author's noted phra&s;es, or tran&s;cribing pa&s;|&s;ages from him. Such a habit will prove fatal to all genuine compo&s;ition. Infinitely better it is to have &s;omething that is our own, though of moderate beauty, than to affect to &s;hine in borrowed ornaments, which will, at la&s;t, betray the utter poverty of our genius. On the&s;e heads of compo&s;ing, cor|recting, reading, and imitating, I advi&s;e every &s;tudent of oratory to con&s;ult what Quinctilian has delivered in the Xth book of his In&s;titutions, where he will find a va|riety
<PB N="55" REF="58">
of excellent ob&s;ervations and directions, that well de&s;erve attention.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, it is an obvious, but material rule, with re&s;pect to Style, that we always &s;tudy to adapt it to the &s;ubject, and al&s;o to the capacity of our hearers, if we are to &s;peak in public. Nothing merits the name of eloquent or beautiful, which is not &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, and to the per&s;ons to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. It is to the la&s;t de|gree awkward and ab&s;urd, to attempt a po|etical florid Style, on occa&s;ions, when it &s;hould be our bu&s;ine&s;s only to argue and rea|&s;on; or to &s;peak with elaborate pomp of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, before per&s;ons who comprehend nothing of it, and who can only &s;tare at our un&s;ea&s;onable magnificence. The&s;e are de|fects not &s;o much in point of Style, as, what is much wor&s;e, in point of common &s;en&s;e. When we begin to write or &s;peak, we ought previou&s;ly to fix in our minds a clear con|ception of the end to be aimed at; to keep this &s;teadily in our view, and to &s;uit our Style to it. If we do not &s;acrifice to this great object, every ill-timed ornament that may occur to our fancy, we are unpardon|able; and though children and fools may admire, men of &s;en&s;e will laugh at us and our Style.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, I cannot conclude the &s;ubject without this admonition, that, in any ca&s;e, and on any occa&s;ion, attention to
<PB N="56" REF="59">
Style mu&s;t not engro&s;s us &s;o much, as to detract from a higher degree of attention to the thoughts: <Q REND="inline">"Curam verborum,"</Q> &s;ays the great Roman Critic, <Q REND="inline">"rerum volo e&s;&s;e &s;olicitudinem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"To your expre&s;&s;ion be attentive; but about your mat|ter be &s;olicitous."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> A direction the more nece&s;&s;ary, that the pre&s;ent ta&s;te of the age in writing, &s;eems to lean more to Style than to thought. It is much ea&s;ier to dre&s;s up trivial and common &s;entiments with &s;ome beauty of expre&s;&s;ion, than to afford a fund of vigorous, ingenious, and u&s;eful thoughts. The latter, requires true genius; the for|mer, may be attained by indu&s;try, with the help of very &s;uperficial parts. Hence, we find &s;o many writers frivolou&s;ly rich in Style, but wretchedly poor in Sentiment. The public ear is now &s;o much accu&s;tomed to a correct and ornamented Style, that no writer can, with &s;afety, neglect the &s;tudy of it. But he is a contemptible one who does not look to &s;omething beyond it; who does not lay the chief &s;tre&s;s upon his mat|ter, and employ &s;uch ornaments of Style to recommend it, as are manly, not foppi&s;h: <Q REND="inline">"Majore animo,"</Q> &s;ays the writer whom I have &s;o often quoted, <Q REND="inline">"aggredienda e&s;t eloquentia; quae &s;i toto corpore valet, ungues polire et capillum componere, non exi&s;timabit ad curam &s;uam pertinere.

<HEAD>LECTURE XX. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE STYLE OF MR. ADDISON, IN N^o. 411. OF THE SPECTATOR.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE in&s;i&s;ted fully on the &s;ubject of Language and Style, both becau&s;e it is, in it&s;elf, of great importance, and becau&s;e it is more capable of being a&s;certained by preci&s;e rule, than &s;everal other parts of compo&s;ition. A critical analy&s;is of the Style of &s;ome good author will tend further to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject; as it will &s;ugge&s;t ob|&s;ervations which I have not had occa&s;ion to make, and will &s;how, in the mo&s;t practical light, the u&s;e of tho&s;e which I have made.</P>
<P>Mr. ADDISON is the author whom I have cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e. The Specta|tor, of which his papers are the chief orna|ment, is a book which is in the hands of every one, and which cannot be prai&s;ed too highly. The good &s;en&s;e, and good writing,
<PB N="59" REF="62">
the u&s;eful morality, and the admirable vein of humour which abound in it, render it one of tho&s;e &s;tandard books which have done the greate&s;t honour to the Engli&s;h na|tion. I have formerly given the general cha|racter of Mr. Addi&s;on's Style and manner, as natural and unaffected, ea&s;y and polite, and full of tho&s;e graces which a flowery imagi|nation diffu&s;es over writing. At the &s;ame time, though one of the mo&s;t beautiful wri|ters in the Language, he is not the mo&s;t correct; a circum&s;tance which renders his compo&s;ition the more proper to be the &s;ub|ject of our pre&s;ent critici&s;m. The free and flowing manner of this amiable writer &s;ometimes led him into inaccuracies, which the more &s;tudied circum&s;pection and care of far inferior writers have taught them to a|void. Remarking his beauties, therefore, which I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to do as I proceed, I mu&s;t al&s;o point out his ne|gligences and defects. Without a free, im|partial di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of both the faults and beauties which occur in his compo&s;ition, it is evident, this piece of critici&s;m would be of no &s;ervice: and, from the freedom which I u&s;e in critici&s;ing Mr. Addi&s;on's Style, none can imagine, that I mean to depreciate his writings, after having re|peatedly declared the high opinion which I entertain of them. The beauties of this author are &s;o many, and the general cha|racter of his Style is &s;o elegant and e&s;tima|ble, that the minute imperfections I &s;hall
<PB N="60" REF="63">
have occa&s;ion to point out, are but like tho&s;e &s;pots in the &s;un, which may be di&s;|covered by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, but which have no effect in ob&s;curing its lu&s;tre. It is, indeed, my judgment, that what Quinctili|an applies to Cicero, <Q REND="inline">"Ille&s;e profeci&s;&s;e &s;ciat, cui Cicero valde placebit,"</Q> may, with ju&s;tice, be applied to Mr Addi&s;on; that to be highly plea&s;ed with his manner of writ|ing, is the criterion of one's having acquir|ed a good ta&s;te in Engli&s;h Style. The pa|per on which we are now to enter, is N^o. 411. the fir&s;t of his celebrated E&s;&s;ays on the Plea&s;ures of the Imagination, in the Sixth Volume of the Spectator. It begins thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Our &s;ight is the mo&s;t perfect, and mo&s;t delightful of all our &s;en&s;es.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS is an excellent introductory &s;en|tence. It is clear, preci&s;e, and &s;imple. The author lays down, in a few plain words, the propo&s;ition which he is going to illu&s;trate throughout the re&s;t of the pa|ragraph. In this manner we &s;hould always &s;et out. A fir&s;t &s;entence &s;hould &s;eldom be a long, and never an intricate one.</P>
<P>HE might have &s;aid, <HI>Our &s;ight is the mo&s;t perfect, and the mo&s;t delightful.</HI>&mdash;But he has judged better, in omitting to repeat the ar|ticle, <HI>the.</HI> For the repetition of it is pro|per, chiefly when we intend to point out the objects of which we &s;peak, as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="61" REF="64">
from, or contra&s;ted with, each other; and when we want that the read|er's attention &s;hould re&s;t on that di&s;tinction. For in&s;tance; had Mr. Addi&s;on intended to &s;ay, That our &s;ight is at once the mo&s;t <HI>de|lightful,</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> of all our &s;en&s;es, the article might then have been repeated with propriety, as a clear and &s;trong di&s;tinction would have been convey|ed. But as between <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>delightful,</HI> there is le&s;s contra&s;t, there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch repetition, It would have had no other effect, but to add a word unnece&s;&s;ari|ly to the &s;entence. He proceeds:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>It fills the mind with the large&s;t variety of ideas, conver&s;es with its objects at the greate&s;t di&s;tance, and continues the longe&s;t in action, without being tired or &s;atiated with its proper enjoyments.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;entence de&s;erves attention, as re|markably harmonious, and well con&s;truct|ed. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, indeed, almo&s;t all the properties of a perfect &s;entence. It is en|tirely per&s;picuous. It is loaded with no &s;u|perfluous or unnece&s;&s;ary words. For, <HI>tired or &s;atiated,</HI> towards the end of the &s;en|tence, are not u&s;ed for &s;ynonymous terms. They convey di&s;tinct ideas, and refer to different members of the period; that this &s;en&s;e <HI>continues the longe&s;t in action without being tired,</HI> that is, without being fatigued with its action; and al&s;o, without being
<PB N="62" REF="65">
<HI>&s;atiated with its proper enjoyments.</HI> That quality of a good &s;entence which I termed its unity, is here perfectly pre&s;erved. It is <HI>our &s;ight</HI> of which he &s;peaks. This is the object carried through the &s;entence, and pre&s;ented to us, in every member of it, by tho&s;e verbs, <HI>fills, conver&s;es, continues,</HI> to each of which, it is clearly the nominative. Tho&s;e capital words are di&s;po&s;ed of in the mo&s;t proper places; and that uniformity is maintained in the con&s;truction of the &s;en|tence, which &s;uits the unity of the object.</P>
<P>OBSERVE too, the mu&s;ic of the period; con&s;i&s;ting of three members, each of which, agreeably to a rule I formerly men|tioned, grows, and ri&s;es above the other in &s;ound, till the &s;entence is conducted, at la&s;t, to one of the mo&s;t melodious clo&s;es which our Language admits; <HI>without being tired or &s;atiated with its proper enjoyments. Enjoyments,</HI> is a word of length and digni|ty, exceedingly proper for a clo&s;e which is de&s;igned to be a mu&s;ical one. The harmo|ny is the more happy, that this di&s;po&s;ition of the members of the period which &s;uits the &s;ound &s;o well, is no le&s;s ju&s;t and pro|per with re&s;pect to the &s;en&s;e. It follows the order of nature. Fir&s;t, we have the variety of objects mentioned, which &s;ight furni&s;hes to the mind; next, we have the action of &s;ight on tho&s;e objects; and la&s;tly, we have time and continuance of its action. No order could be more natural or happy.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66">
THIS &s;entence has &s;till another beauty. It is figurative, without being too much &s;o for the &s;ubject. A metaphor runs through it. The &s;en&s;e of &s;ight is, in &s;ome degree, per|&s;onified. We are told of its <HI>conver&s;ing</HI> with its objects; and of its not being <HI>tired</HI> or <HI>&s;atiat|ed</HI> with its <HI>enjoyments;</HI> all which expre&s;&s;ions are plain allu&s;ions to the actions and feelings of men. This is that &s;light &s;ort of Per|&s;onification, which, without any appear|ance of boldne&s;s, and without elevating the fancy much above its ordinary &s;tate, renders di&s;cour&s;e picture&s;que, and leads us to conceive the author's meaning more di&s;|tinctly, by clothing ab&s;tract ideas, in &s;ome degree, with &s;en&s;ible colours. Mr. Addi|&s;on abounds with this beauty of Style be|yond mo&s;t authors; and the &s;entence which we have been con&s;idering, is very expre&s;|&s;ive of his manner of writing. There is no blemi&s;h in it whatever, unle&s;s that a &s;trict Critic might perhaps object, that the epithet <HI>large,</HI> which he applies to <HI>variety,&mdash;the large&s;t variety of ideas,</HI> is an epithet more commonly applied to extent than to number. It is plain, that he here employ|ed it to avoid the repetition of the word <HI>great,</HI> which occurs immediately after|wards.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>The &s;en&s;e of feeling can, indeed, give us a notion of exten&s;ion, &s;hape, and all other ideas that enter at the eye, except colours; but, at the &s;ame time, it is very much &s;traitened and</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="67">
<HI>confined in its operations, to the number, bulk, and di&s;tance of its particular objects.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;entence is by no means &s;o happy as the former. It is, indeed, neither clear nor elegant. <HI>Exten&s;ion and &s;hape</HI> can, with no propriety, be called <HI>ideas;</HI> they are pro|perties of matter. Neither is it accurate, even according to Mr. Locke's philo&s;ophy (with which our Author &s;eems here to have puzzled him&s;elf), to &s;peak of any &s;en&s;e <HI>giv|ing us a notion of ideas;</HI> our &s;en&s;es give us the ideas them&s;elves. The meaning would have been much more clear, if the Author had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline">"The &s;en&s;e of feeling can indeed, give us the idea of exten&s;ion, figure, and all the other pro|perties of matter which are perceived by the eye, except colours."</Q></P>
<P>THE latter part of the &s;entence is &s;till more embarra&s;&s;ed. For what meaning can we make of &s;en&s;e of feeling, being <HI>confined, in its operations, to the number, bulk, and di&s;tance, of its particular objects?</HI> Surely, every &s;en&s;e is confined, as much as the &s;en&s;e of feeling, to the number, bulk, and di&s;tance of its own objects. Sight and feeling are, in this re&s;pect, perfectly on a level; neither of them can extend beyond their own objects. The turn of expre&s;&s;ion is &s;o inaccurate here, that one would be apt to &s;u&s;pect two words to have been omit|ted in the printing, which were originally in Mr. Addi&s;on's manu&s;cript; becau&s;e the
<PB N="65" REF="68">
in&s;ertion would render the &s;en&s;e much more intelligible and clear. The&s;e two words are, <HI>with regard:&mdash;it is very much &s;traitened, and confined, in its operations, with regard to the number, bulk, and di&s;tance of its particu|lar objects.</HI> The meaning then would be, that feeling is more limited than &s;ight <HI>in this re&s;pect;</HI> that it is confined to a narrower circle, to a &s;maller number of objects.</P>
<P>THE epithet <HI>particular,</HI> applied to <HI>objects,</HI> in the conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, is redun|dant, and conveys no meaning whatever. Mr. Addi&s;on &s;eems to have u&s;ed it in place of <HI>peculiar,</HI> as indeed he does often in other pa&s;&s;ages of his writings. But <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>peculiar,</HI> though they are too often confounded, are words of different import from each other. <HI>Particular</HI> &s;tands oppo&s;ed to <HI>general; peculiar</HI> &s;tands oppo&s;ed, to what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in <HI>common with others. Particu|lar</HI> expre&s;&s;es what in the logical Style is called <HI>Species; peculiar,</HI> what is called <HI>diffe|rentia.&mdash;Its peculiar objects</HI> would have &s;ig|nified in this place, the objects of the &s;en&s;e of feeling, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the objects of any other &s;en&s;e; and would have had more meaning than <HI>its particular objects.</HI> Though, in truth, neither the one nor the other epithet was requi&s;ite. It was &s;uffi|cient to have &s;aid &s;imply, <HI>its objects.</HI></P>

<P>HERE again the author's Style returns upon us in all its beauty. This is a &s;en|tence di&s;tinct, graceful, well arranged, and highly mu&s;ical.

<P><PB N="70" REF="73">
THOUGH <HI>fix</HI> and <HI>determine</HI> may appear &s;ynonymous words, yet a difference be|tween them may be remarked, and they may be viewed, as applied here, with pe|culiar delicacy. The author had ju&s;t &s;aid, that the words of which he is &s;peaking were <HI>loo&s;e</HI> and <HI>uncircum&s;cribed. Fix</HI> relates to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>determine</HI> to the la&s;t.

For we cannot conceive the mean|ing of a word, nor indeed of any other thing clearly, till we &s;ee its limits, and know how far it extends. The&s;e two words, therefore, have grace and beauty as they are here applied; though a writer, more frugal of words than Mr. Addi&s;on, would have preferred the &s;ingle word <HI>a&s;cer|tain,</HI> which conveys, without any meta|phor, the import of them both.</P>
<P>THE <HI>notion of the&s;e words</HI> is &s;omewhat of a har&s;h phra&s;e, at lea&s;t not &s;o commonly u&s;ed, as the <HI>meaning of the&s;e words&mdash;as I intend to make u&s;e of them in the thread of my &s;peculations;</HI> this is plainly faulty.

<P>IT is a great rule in laying down the di|vi&s;ion of a &s;ubject, to &s;tudy neatne&s;s and brevity as much as po&s;&s;ible.

<P><HI>Polite</HI> is a term more commonly applied to manners or behaviour, than to the mind or imagination.

<P>ALL this is very beautiful. The illu&s;|tration is happy; and the Style runs with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and harmony. We &s;ee no labour, no &s;tiffne&s;s, or affectation; but an author writing from the native flow of a gay and plea&s;ing imagination. This pre|dominant character of Mr. Addi&s;on's man|ner, far more than compen&s;ates all tho&s;e lit|tle negligences which we are now remark|ing. Two of the&s;e occur in this para|graph.

THE other in&s;tance of negligence, is to|wards the end of the paragraph&mdash;<HI>So that he looks upon the world, as it were, in another light.&mdash;By another</HI> light, Mr. Addi&s;on means, a light different from that in which other men view the world. But though this ex|pre&s;&s;ion clearly conveyed this meaning to him&s;elf when writing, it conveys it very indi&s;tinctly to others; and is an in&s;tance of that &s;ort of inaccuracy, into which, in the warmth of compo&s;ition, every writer of a lively imagination is apt to fall; and which can only be remedied by a cool, &s;ub&s;equent review.&mdash;<HI>As it were</HI>&mdash;is upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions no more than an ungraceful palliative, and here there was not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for it, as he was not about to &s;ay any thing which required a &s;oftening of this kind.

<P>ON this &s;entence, nothing occurs de|&s;erving of remark, except that <HI>worked out by dint of thinking,</HI> is a phra&s;e which bor|ders too much on vulgar and colloquial language, to be proper for being employed in a poli&s;hed compo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXI. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE STYLE IN N^o. 412. OF THE SPEC|TATOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations which have occur|red in reviewing that paper of Mr. Addi&s;on's, which was the &s;ubject of the la&s;t Lecture, &s;ufficiently &s;how, that in the writings of an author of the mo&s;t happy genius, and di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, inaccura|cies may &s;ometimes be found. Though &s;uch inaccuracies may be overbalanced by &s;o many beauties, as render Style highly plea&s;ing and agreeable upon the whole, yet it mu&s;t be de&s;irable to every writer to avoid, as far as he can, inaccuracy of any kind. As the &s;ubject therefore is of importance, I have thought it might be u&s;eful to carry on this critici&s;m through|out two or three &s;ub&s;equent Papers of the Spectator. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t inti|mate, that the Lectures on the&s;e Papers
<PB N="84" REF="87">
are &s;olely intended for &s;uch as are apply|ing them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of Engli&s;h Style. I pretend not to give in&s;truction to tho&s;e who are already well acquainted with the powers of language. To them my re|marks may prove unedifying; to &s;ome they may &s;eem tedious and minute: but to &s;uch as have not yet made all the proficiency which they de&s;ire in elegance of Style, &s;trict attention to the compo&s;ition and &s;tructure of &s;entences cannot fail to prove of con&s;iderable benefit: and though my remarks on Mr. Addi&s;on &s;hould, in any in&s;tance, be thought ill-founded, they will, at lea&s;t, &s;erve the purpo&s;e of lead|ing them into the train of making proper remarks for them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If there be readers who think any farther apology requi|&s;ite for my adventuring to critici&s;e the &s;entences of &s;o eminent an author as Mr. Addi&s;on, I mu&s;t take notice, that I was na|turally led to it by the circum&s;tances of that part of the king|dom where the&s;e Lectures were read; where the ordinary &s;po|ken language often differs much from what is u&s;ed by good Engli&s;h authors. Hence it occurred to me, as a proper me|thod of correcting any peculiarities of dialect, to direct &s;tu|dents of eloquence, to analize and examine, with particular attention, the &s;tructure of Mr. Addi&s;on's &s;entences. Tho&s;e Papers of the Spectator, which are the &s;ubject of the following Lectures, were accordingly given out in exerci&s;e to &s;tudents, to be thus examined and analized; and &s;everal of the ob&s;erva|tions which follow, both on the beauties and blemi&s;hes of this Author, were &s;ugge&s;ted, by the ob&s;ervations given to me in con&s;equence of the exerci&s;e pre&s;cribed.</NOTE>. I proceed, there|fore, to the examination of the &s;ub&s;equent paper N^o. 412.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider tho&s;e plea&s;ures of the imagination, which ari&s;e from the actual view and &s;urvey of outward</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="88">
<HI>objects: and the&s;e, I think, all proceed from the &s;ight of what is great, uncommon, or beautiful.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;entence gives occa&s;ion for no ma|terial remark. It is &s;imple and di&s;tinct. The two words which he here u&s;es, <HI>view</HI> and <HI>&s;urvey,</HI> are not altogether &s;ynonymous: as the former may be &s;uppo&s;ed to import mere in&s;pection; the latter more deliberate examination. Yet they lie &s;o near to one another in meaning, that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, any one of them, perhaps, would have been &s;ufficient. The epithet <HI>actual,</HI> is introduced, in order to mark more &s;trong|ly the di&s;tinction between what our author calls the primary plea&s;ures of imagination, which ari&s;e from immediate view, and the &s;econdary, which ari&s;e from remembrance or de&s;cription.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>There may, indeed, be &s;omething &s;o terrible or offen|&s;ive, that the horror, or loath&s;omene&s;s of an object, may overbear the plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from its novelty, greatne&s;s, or beauty; but &s;till there will be &s;uch a mix|ture of delight in the very di&s;gu&s;t it gives us, as any of the&s;e three qualifications are mo&s;t con&s;picuous and pre|vailing.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;entence mu&s;t be acknowledged to be an unfortunate one. The &s;en&s;e is ob|&s;cure and embarra&s;&s;ed, and the expre&s;&s;ion loo&s;e and irregular. The beginning of it is perplexed by the wrong po&s;ition of the words <HI>&s;omething</HI> and <HI>object.</HI> The natural
<PB N="86" REF="89">
arrangement would have been, <HI>There may, indeed, be &s;omething in an object &s;o terrible or offen&s;ive, that the horror or loath&s;omene&s;s of it may overbear.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e two epithets, <HI>horror</HI> or <HI>loath&s;omene&s;s,</HI> are awkwardly joined to|gether. <HI>Loath&s;omene&s;s</HI> is, indeed, a quality which may be a&s;cribed to an object; but <HI>horror</HI> is not; it is a feeling excited in the mind. The Language would have been much more correct, had our Author &s;aid, <HI>There may, indeed, be &s;omething in an object &s;o terrible or offen&s;ive, that the horror or di&s;gu&s;t which it excites may overbear.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t two epithets, <HI>terrible</HI> or <HI>offen&s;ive,</HI> would then have expre&s;&s;ed the qualities of an object; the latter, <HI>horror</HI> or <HI>di&s;gu&s;t,</HI> the corre&s;pond|ing &s;entiments which the&s;e qualities pro|duce in us. <HI>Loath&s;omene&s;s</HI> was the mo&s;t un|happy word he could have cho&s;en: for to be <HI>loath&s;ome,</HI> is to be odious, and &s;eems to|tally to exclude any <HI>mixture of delight,</HI> which he afterwards &s;uppo&s;es may be found in the object.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of the &s;entence there are &s;everal inaccuracies. When he &s;ays, <HI>there will be &s;uch a mixture of delight in the very di&s;gu&s;t it gives us, as any of the&s;e three qualifications are mo&s;t con&s;picuous.</HI> The con|&s;truction is defective, and &s;eems hardly grammatical. He meant a&s;&s;uredly to &s;ay, <HI>&s;uch a mixture of delight as is proportioned to the degree in which any of the&s;e three qualifi|cations are mo&s;t con&s;picuous.</HI>&mdash;We know, that
<PB N="87" REF="90">
there may be a mixture of plea&s;ant and of di&s;agreeable feelings excited by the &s;ame object; yet it appears inaccurate to &s;ay, that there is any <HI>delight in the very di&s;gu&s;t.</HI>&mdash;The plural verb <HI>are,</HI> is improperly joined to <HI>any of the&s;e three qualifications;</HI> for as <HI>any</HI> is here u&s;ed di&s;tributively, and means <HI>any one of the&s;e three qualifications,</HI> the corre&s;|ponding verb ought to have been &s;ingular. The order in which the two la&s;t words are placed, &s;hould have been rever&s;ed, and made to &s;tand, <HI>prevailing and con&s;picuous.</HI> They are <HI>con&s;picuous,</HI> becau&s;e they <HI>prevail.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>By greatne&s;s, I do not only mean the bulk of any &s;ingle object, but the largene&s;s of a whole view, con&s;idered as one entire piece.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN a former Lecture, when treating of the Structure of Sentences, I quoted this &s;entence as an in&s;tance of the carele&s;s man|ner in which adverbs are &s;ometimes inter|jected in the mid&s;t of a period. <HI>Only,</HI> as it is here placed, appears to be a limitation of the following verb, <HI>mean.</HI> The que&s;tion might be put, What more does he than only mean? as the author, undoubtedly, intend|ed it to refer to the <HI>bulk of a &s;ingle object,</HI> it would have been placed, with more pro|priety, after the&s;e words:&mdash;<HI>I do not mean the bulk of any &s;ingle object only, but the largene&s;s of a whole view.</HI>&mdash;As the following phra&s;e, <HI>con&s;idered as one entire piece,</HI> &s;eems to be &s;omewhat deficient, both in dignity and
<PB N="88" REF="91">
propriety, perhaps this adjection might have been altogether omitted, and the &s;entence have clo&s;ed with fully as much advantage at the word <HI>view.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Such are the pro&s;pects of an open champaign country, a va&s;t uncultivated de&s;ert, of huge heaps of mountains, high rocks and precipices, or a wide expan&s;e of waters, where we are not &s;truck with the novelty, or beauty of the &s;ight, but with that rude kind of magnificence which appears in many of the&s;e &s;tupendous works of nature.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;entence, in the main, is beautiful. The objects pre&s;ented are all of them noble, &s;elected with judgment, arranged with pro|priety, and accompanied with proper epi|thets. We mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that the &s;entence is too loo&s;ely, and not very gramatically, connected with the preceding one. He &s;ays,&mdash;<HI>&s;uch are the pro&s;pects;&mdash;&s;uch,</HI> &s;ignifies, of that nature or quality; which nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;es &s;ome adjec|tive, or word de&s;criptive of a quality go|ing before, to which it refers. But, in the foregoing &s;entence, there is no &s;uch adjec|tive. He had &s;poken of <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> in the ab&s;tract only; and, therefore, <HI>&s;uch</HI> has no di&s;tinct antecedent to which we can refer it. The &s;entence would have been intro|duced with more grammatical propriety, by &s;aying, <HI>To this cla&s;s belong,</HI> or, under this head are ranged the pro&s;pects, &amp;c.&mdash;The <HI>of,</HI> which is prefixed to <HI>huge heaps of mountains,</HI> is mi&s;placed, and has, perhaps,
<PB N="89" REF="92">
been an error in the printing; as, either all the particulars here enumerated &s;hould have had this mark of the genitive, or it &s;hould have been prefixed to none but the fir&s;t.&mdash;When, in the clo&s;e of the &s;entence, the Author &s;peaks of that <HI>rude magnificence, which appears in many of the&s;e &s;tupendous works of nature,</HI> he had better have omitted the word <HI>many,</HI> which &s;eems to except &s;ome of them. Whereas, in his general propo&s;i|tion, he undoubtedly meant to include all the &s;tupendous works he had enumerated; and there is no que&s;tion that, in all of them, a rude magnificence appears.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Our imagination loves to be filled with an object, or to gra&s;p at any thing that is too big for its capacity. We are flung into a plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;uch unbounded views; and feel a delightful &s;tillne&s;s and amazement in the &s;oul, at the apprehen&s;ion of them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Language here is elegant, and &s;e|veral of the expre&s;&s;ions remarkably happy. There is nothing which requires any ani|madver&s;ion except the clo&s;e, <HI>at the appre|hen&s;ion of them.</HI> Not only is this a languid enfeebling conclu&s;ion of a &s;entence, other|wi&s;e beautiful, but <HI>the apprehen&s;ion of views,</HI> is a phra&s;e de&s;titute of all propriety, and, indeed, &s;carcely intelligible. Had this ad|jection been entirely omitted, and the &s;en|tence been allowed to clo&s;e with <HI>&s;tillne&s;s and amazement in the &s;oul,</HI> it would have been a great improvement. Nothing is
<PB N="90" REF="93">
frequently more hurtful to the grace or vi|vacity of a period, than &s;uperfluous dragg|ing words at the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>The mind of man naturally hates every thing that looks like a re&s;traint upon it, and is apt to fancy it&s;elf under a &s;ort of confinement, when the &s;ight is pent up in a nar|row compa&s;s, and &s;hortened on every &s;ide by the neigh|bourhood of walls or mountains. On the contrary, a &s;pa|cious horizon is an image of liberty, where the eye has room to range abroad, to expatiate at large on the im|men&s;ity of its views, and to lo&s;e it&s;elf amid&s;t the variety of objects that offer them&s;elves to its ob&s;ervation. Such wide and undetermined pro&s;pects are as plea&s;ing to the fancy, as the &s;peculations of eternity, or infinitude, are to the under&s;tanding.</HI></Q></P>
<P>OUR Author's Style appears, here, in all that native beauty which cannot be too much prai&s;ed. The numbers flow &s;moothly, and with a graceful harmony. The words which he has cho&s;en, carry a certain am|plitude and fulne&s;s, well &s;uited to the na|ture of the &s;ubject; and the members of the periods ri&s;e in a gradation, accommodated to the ri&s;e of the thought. The eye fir&s;t <HI>ranges abroad;</HI> then <HI>expatiates at large on the immen&s;ity of its views;</HI> and, at la&s;t, <HI>lo&s;es it&s;elf amid&s;t the variety of objects that offer them&s;elves to its ob&s;ervation.</HI> The <HI>fancy</HI> is elegantly contra&s;ted with the <HI>under&s;tand|ing, pro&s;pects</HI> with <HI>&s;peculations,</HI> and <HI>wide and undetermined pro&s;pect,</HI> with <HI>&s;peculations of eternity and infinitude.</HI></P>

<P>THE article prefixed to <HI>beauty,</HI> in the be|ginning of this &s;entence, might have been omitted, and the Style have run, perhaps, to more advantage thus: <HI>But if beauty, or uncommonne&s;s, be joined to this grandeur&mdash;A land&s;cape cut out into rivers, woods,</HI> &amp;c. &s;eems un&s;ea&s;onably to imply an artificial formation, and had better have been expre&s;|&s;ed by, <HI>diver&s;ified with rivers, woods,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Every thing that is new or uncommon, rai&s;es a plea|&s;ure in the imagination, becau&s;e it fills the &s;oul with an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e, gratifies its curio&s;ity, and gives it an idea of which it was not before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. We are, in|deed, &s;o often conver&s;ant with one &s;et of objects, and ti|red out with &s;o many repeated &s;hows of the &s;ame things, that whatever is new or uncommon contributes a little to vary human life, and to divert our minds, for a while, with the &s;trangene&s;s of its appearance. It &s;erves us for a kind of refre&s;hment, and takes off from that &s;atiety we are apt to complain of in our u&s;ual and ordinary enter|tainments.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Style in the&s;e Sentences flows in an ea&s;y and agreeable manner. A &s;evere cri|tic might point out &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that would bear being retrenched. But this would alter the genius and character of Mr.
<PB N="92" REF="95">
Addi&s;on's Style. We mu&s;t always remem|ber, that good compo&s;ition admits of being carried on under many different forms. Style mu&s;t not be reduced to one preci&s;e &s;tandard. One writer may be as agreeable, by a plea&s;ing diffu&s;ene&s;s, when the &s;ubject bears, and his genius prompts it, as ano|ther by a conci&s;e and forcible manner. It is fit, however, to ob&s;erve, that, in the beginning of tho&s;e Sentences which we have at pre&s;ent before us, the phra&s;e, <HI>rai&s;es a plea&s;ure in the imagination,</HI> is unque&s;tion|ably too flat and feeble, and might ea&s;ily be amended, by &s;aying, <HI>affords plea&s;ure to the imagination;</HI> and towards the end, there are two <HI>of</HI>'s, which grate har&s;hly on the ear, in that phra&s;e, <HI>takes off from that &s;a|tiety we are apt to complain of;</HI> where the correction is as ea&s;ily made as in the other ca&s;e, by &s;ub&s;tituting, <HI>dimini&s;hes that &s;atiety of which we are apt to complain.</HI> Such in|&s;tances &s;how the advantage of frequent re|views of what we have written, in order to give proper correctne&s;s and poli&s;h to our Language.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>It is this which be&s;tows charms on a mon&s;ter, and makes even the imperfections of nature plea&s;e us. It is this that recommends variety where the mind is every in&s;tant called off to &s;omething new, and the attention not &s;uffered to dwell too long, and wa&s;te it&s;elf, on any par|ticular object. It is this likewi&s;e, that improves what is great or beautiful, and makes it afford the mind a double entertainment.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="96">
STILL the Style proceeds with per&s;picu|ity, grace, and harmony. The full and ample a&s;&s;ertion, with which each of the&s;e Sentences is introduced, frequent, on many occa&s;ions, with our author, is here proper and &s;ea&s;onable; as it was his intention to magnify, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the effects of novelty and variety, and to draw our at|tention to them. His frequent u&s;e of <HI>that,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>which,</HI> is another peculiarity of his Style; but, on this occa&s;ion in particu|lar, cannot be much commended, as, <HI>it is this which,</HI> &s;eems, in every view, to be better than, <HI>it is this that,</HI> three times re|peated.

produced by Novelty and Variety, and our minds naturally recur to this, as the rea&s;on here alluded to; but his language does not properly expre&s;s it. It is, indeed, one of the defects of this amiable writer, that his &s;entences are often too negligently connec|ted with one another. His meaning, upon the whole, we gather with ea&s;e from the tenour of his di&s;cour&s;e. Yet this negligence prevents his &s;en&s;e from &s;triking us with that force and evidence, which a more accurate juncture of parts would have produced. Bating this inaccuracy, the&s;e two &s;entences, e&s;pecially the latter, are remarkably elegant and beautiful. The clo&s;e, in particular, is uncommonly fine, and carries as much ex|pre&s;&s;ive harmony as the language can admit. It &s;eems to paint, what he is de&s;cribing, at once to the eye and the ear.&mdash;<HI>Such objects as are ever in motion, and &s;liding away from beneath the eye of the beholder.</HI>&mdash;Indeed, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e &s;mall errors, which the &s;trictne&s;s of critical examination obliges me to point out, it may be &s;afely pronoun|ced, that the two paragraphs which we have now con&s;idered in this paper, the one concerning greatne&s;s, and the other con|cerning novelty, are extremely worthy of Mr. Addi&s;on, and exhibit a Style, which they who can &s;ucce&s;sfully imitate, may e&s;teem them&s;elves happy.</P>

<P>SOME degree of verbo&s;ity may be here di&s;covered, and phra&s;es repeated, which are little more than the echo of one ano|ther; &s;uch as&mdash;<HI>diffu&s;ing &s;atisfaction and complacency through the imagination&mdash;&s;trik|ing the mind with inward joy&mdash;&s;preading cheerfulne&s;s and delight through all its facul|ties.</HI> At the &s;ame time, I readily admit that this full and flowing Style, even though it carry &s;ome redundancy, is not un&s;uitable to the gaiety of the &s;ubject on which the author is entering, and is more allowable here, than it would have been on &s;ome other occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>IN this &s;entence there is nothing remark|able, in any view, to draw our attention. We may ob&s;erve only, that the word <HI>more,</HI> towards the beginning, is not in its proper place, and that the prepo&s;ition <HI>in,</HI> is want|ing

<P>NEITHER is there here any particular ele|gance or felicity of language.&mdash;<HI>Different &s;en&s;e of Beauty</HI> would have been a more proper expre&s;&s;ion to have been applied to irrational creatures, than as it &s;tands, <HI>differ|ent notions of Beauty.</HI> In the clo&s;e of the &s;econd Sentence, when the Author &s;ays, <HI>colour of its &s;pecies,</HI> he is guilty of a con&s;i|derable inaccuracy in changing the gender, as he had &s;aid in the &s;ame Sentence, that the <HI>male was determined in his court&s;hip.</HI></P>

<P>THE chief ground of critici&s;m on this Sentence, is the disjointed &s;ituation of the relative <HI>which.</HI> Grammatically, it refers to <HI>the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the Sun.</HI> But the Author meant, that it &s;hould refer <HI>to the &s;how</HI> which appears in the heavens at that time.

This practice &s;aves them trouble in mar&s;haling their words, and arranging a period: but, though it may leave their meaning intelli|gible, yet it renders that meaning much le&s;s per&s;picuous, determined, and preci&s;e, than it might otherwi&s;e have been. The error I have pointed out, might have been avoid|ed by a &s;mall alternation in the con&s;truction of the Sentence, after &s;ome &s;uch manner as this: <HI>We no where meet with a more glo|rious and plea&s;ing &s;how in nature, than what is formed in the heavens at the ri&s;ing</HI>

<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Thus any continued &s;ound, as the mu&s;ic of birds, or a fall of water, awakens every moment the mind of the be|holder, and makes him more attentive to the &s;everal beau|ties of the place which lie before him.

<P>WHETHER Mr. Addi&s;on's theory here be ju&s;t or not, may be que&s;tioned.

<HEAD>LECTURE XXII. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE STYLE IN N^o. 413. OF THE SPEC|TATOR.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>THOUGH in ye&s;terday's Paper we con&s;idered how every thing that is great, new, or beautiful, is apt to affect the imagination with plea&s;ure, we mu&s;t own, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to a&s;&s;ign the nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of this plea&s;ure, becau&s;e we know neither the nature of an idea, nor the &s;ub&s;tance of a human &s;oul, which might help us to di&s;cover the conformity or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the one to the other; and, therefore, for want of &s;uch a light, all that we can do in &s;peculations of this kind, is, to re|flect on tho&s;e operations of the &s;oul that are mo&s;t agree|able, and to range, under their proper heads, what is plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing to the mind, without being able to trace out the &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary and efficient cau&s;es from whence the plea&s;ure or di&s;plea&s;ure ari&s;es.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Sentence, con&s;idered as an intro|ductory one, mu&s;t be acknowledged to be very faulty. An introductory Sentence &s;hould never contain any thing that can in any degree fatigue or puzzle the reader. When an Author is entering on a new
<PB N="104" REF="107">
branch of his &s;ubject, informing us of what he has done, and what he purpo&s;es farther to do, we naturally expect that he &s;hould expre&s;s him&s;elf in the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t per|&s;picuous manner po&s;&s;ible. But the Sentence now before us is crowded and indi&s;tinct; containing three &s;eparate propo&s;itions, which, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;how, required &s;eparate Sentences to have unfolded them. Mr. Ad|di&s;on's chief excellency, as a writer, lay in de&s;cribing and painting. There he is great; but in methodi&s;ing and rea&s;oning, he is not &s;o eminent. As, be&s;ides the general fault of prolixity and indi&s;tinctne&s;s, this Sentence contains &s;everal inaccuracies, I will be obliged to enter into a minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of its &s;tructure and parts; a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which to many readers will appear tedious, and which therefore they will naturally pa&s;s over; but which, to tho&s;e who are &s;tudying compo&s;ition, I hope may prove of &s;ome benefit.</P>
<P><HI>Though in ye&s;terday's Paper we con&s;idered</HI>&mdash;The import of <HI>though</HI> is, <HI>notwith&s;tanding that.</HI> When it appears in the beginning of a Sentence, its relative generally is <HI>yet:</HI> and it is employed to warn us, after we have been informed of &s;ome truth, that we are not to infer from it &s;ome other thing which we might perhaps have expected to follow: <Q REND="inline">"Though virtue be the only road to happine&s;s, yet it does not permit the un|limited gratification of our de&s;ires."</Q> Now
<PB N="105" REF="108">
it is plain, that there was no &s;uch oppo&s;i|tion between the &s;ubject of ye&s;terday's Pa|per, and what the Author is now going to &s;ay, between his a&s;&s;erting a fact, and his not being able to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of that fact, as rendered the u&s;e of this adver&s;ative particle <HI>though,</HI> either nece&s;&s;ary or proper in the introduction.&mdash;<HI>We con&s;idered how eve|ry thing that is great, new, or beautiful, is apt to affect the imagination with plea&s;ure.</HI>&mdash;The adverb <HI>how</HI> &s;ignifies, either the means by which, or the manner in which, &s;ome|thing is done. But, in truth, neither one nor other of the&s;e had been con&s;idered by our Author. He had illu&s;trated the fact alone, that they do affect the imagination with plea&s;ure; and, with re&s;pect to the <HI>quomodo,</HI> or the <HI>how,</HI> he is &s;o far from hav|ing con&s;idered it, that he is ju&s;t now going to &s;how that it cannot be explained, and that we mu&s;t re&s;t contented with the know|ledge of the fact alone, and of its purpo&s;e or final cau&s;e.&mdash;<HI>We mu&s;t own, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible for us to a&s;&s;ign the nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e</HI> (he means; what is more commonly called the <HI>efficient cau&s;e) of this plea&s;ure, becau&s;e we know neither the nature of an idea, nor the &s;ub&s;tance of a human &s;oul.&mdash;The &s;ub&s;tance of a human &s;oul</HI> is certainly a very uncouth ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and there appears no rea&s;on why he &s;hould have varied from the word <HI>nature,</HI> which would have equally applied to <HI>idea</HI> and to <HI>&s;oul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">
<HI>Which might help us,</HI> our Author pro|ceeds, <HI>to di&s;cover the conformity or di&s;agreea|blene&s;s of the one to the other.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>which,</HI> at the beginning of this member of the period, is &s;urely ungrammatical, as it is a relative, without any antecedent in all the Sentence. It refers, by the con&s;truction, to <HI>the nature of an idea, or the &s;ub&s;tance of a human &s;oul;</HI> but this is by no means the reference which the Author intended. His meaning is, that <HI>our knowing</HI> the nature of an idea, and the &s;ub&s;tance of a human &s;oul, might help us to di&s;cover the conformity or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the one to the other: and therefore the &s;yntax ab&s;olutely required the word <HI>know|ledge</HI> to have been in&s;erted as the antecedent to <HI>which.</HI> I have before remarked, and the remark de&s;erves to be repeated, that nothing is a more certain &s;ign of carele&s;s compo&s;ition than to make &s;uch relatives as <HI>which,</HI> not refer to any preci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion, but carry a loo&s;e and vague relation to the general &s;train of what had gone before. When our &s;en|tences run into this form, we may be a&s;&s;ured there is &s;omething in the con&s;truction of them that requires alteration. The phra&s;e of di&s;covering <HI>the conformity or di&s;agreeable|ne&s;s of the one to the other</HI> is likewi&s;e excep|tionable; for <HI>di&s;agreeablene&s;s</HI> neither forms a proper contra&s;t to the other word, <HI>confor|mity,</HI> nor expre&s;&s;es what the author meant here (as far as any meaning can be gathered from his words), that is, a certain un&s;uit|ablene&s;s or want of conformity to the na|ture
<PB N="107" REF="110">
of the &s;oul. To &s;ay the truth, this member of the &s;entence had much better have been omitted altogether. <HI>The confor|mity or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of an idea to the &s;ub|&s;tance of a human &s;oul,</HI> is a phra&s;e which conveys to the mind no di&s;tinct nor intel|ligent conception whatever. The author had before given a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his not a&s;&s;igning the efficient cau&s;e of tho&s;e plea&s;ures of the imagination, becau&s;e we neither know the nature of our own ideas nor of the &s;oul: and this farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion about the conformity or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the nature of the one, to the &s;ub&s;tance of the other, affords no clear nor u&s;eful illu&s;tration.</P>
<P><HI>And therefore,</HI> the &s;entence goes on, <HI>for want of &s;uch a light, all that we can do in &s;peculations of this kind, is to reflect on tho&s;e operations of the &s;oul that are mo&s;t agreeable, and to range under their proper heads what is plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing to the mind.</HI>&mdash;The two expre&s;&s;ions in the beginning of this member, <HI>therefore,</HI> and <HI>for want of &s;uch a light,</HI> evi|dently refer to the &s;ame thing, and are quite &s;ynonymous. One or other of them, there|fore, had better have been omitted. In&s;tead of <HI>to range under their proper heads,</HI> the lan|guage would have been &s;moother, if <HI>their</HI> had been left out;&mdash;<HI>without being able to trace out the &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary and efficient cau&s;es from whence the plea&s;ure or di&s;plea&s;ure ari&s;es.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>from whence,</HI> though
<PB N="108" REF="111">
&s;eemingly ju&s;tified by very frequent u&s;age, is taxed by Dr. John&s;on as a vicious mode of &s;peech; &s;eeing <HI>whence</HI> alone, has all the power of <HI>from whence,</HI> which therefore ap|pears an unnece&s;&s;ary reduplication. I am inclined to think, that the whole of this la&s;t member of the &s;entence had better have been dropped. The period might have clo&s;ed with full propriety, at the words, <HI>plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing to the mind.</HI> All that follows, &s;ugge&s;ts no idea that had not been fully conveyed in the preceding part of the &s;entence. It is a mere expletive adjection which might be omitted, not only without injury to the meaning, but to the great re|lief of a &s;entence already labouring under the multitude of words.</P>
<P>HAVING now fini&s;hed the analy&s;is of this long &s;entence, I am inclined to be of opinion, that if, on any occa&s;ion, we can adventure to alter Mr. Addi&s;on's Style, it may be done to advantage here, by break|ing down this period in the following man|ner: <Q REND="inline">"In ye&s;terday's paper, we have &s;hown that every thing which is great, new, or beautiful, is apt to affect the imagination with plea&s;ure. We mu&s;t own, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to a&s;&s;ign the efficient cau&s;e of this plea&s;ure, becau&s;e we know not the nature either of an idea, or of the human &s;oul. All that we can do, therefore, in &s;peculations of this kind, is to reflect on the operations of the &s;oul,
<PB N="109" REF="112">
which are mo&s;t agreeable, and to range under proper heads, what is plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing to the mind."</Q>&mdash;We proceed now to the examination of the following &s;entences.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Final cau&s;es lie more bare and open to our ob&s;ervation, as there are often a great variety that belong to the &s;ame effect; and the&s;e, though they are not altogether &s;o &s;atis|factory, are generally more u&s;eful than the other, as they give us greater occa&s;ion of admiring the goodne&s;s and wi&s;|dom of the fir&s;t contriver.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THOUGH &s;ome difference might be traced between the &s;en&s;e of <HI>bare</HI> and <HI>open,</HI> yet as they are here employed, they are &s;o nearly &s;ynonymous, that one of them was &s;uffi|cient. It would have been enough to have &s;aid, <HI>Final cau&s;es lie more open to ob&s;ervation.</HI>&mdash;One can &s;carcely help ob&s;erving here, that the obviou&s;ne&s;s of final cau&s;es does not proceed, as Mr. Addi&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, from a variety of them concurring in the &s;ame effect, which is often not the ca&s;e; but from our being able to a&s;certain more clearly, from our own experience, the con|gruity of a final cau&s;e with the circum|&s;tances of our condition; whereas the con|&s;tituent parts of &s;ubjects, whence efficient cau&s;es proceed, lie for mo&s;t part beyond the reach of our faculties. But as this remark re&s;pects the thought more than the &s;tyle, it is &s;ufficient for us to ob&s;erve, that when he &s;ays, <HI>a great variety that belong to the</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="113">
<HI>&s;ame effect,</HI> the expre&s;&s;ion, &s;trictly con&s;ider|ed, is not altogether proper. The acce&s;|&s;ory is properly &s;aid to belong to the prin|cipal; not the principal to the acce&s;&s;ory. Now an effect is con&s;idered as the acce&s;&s;ory or con&s;equence of its cau&s;e; and therefore, though we might well &s;ay a variety of ef|fects belong to the &s;ame cau&s;e, it &s;eems not &s;o proper to &s;ay, that a variety of cau&s;es belong to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>One of the final cau&s;es of our delight in any thing that is great may be this: The Supreme Author of our being has &s;o formed the &s;oul of man, that nothing but him&s;elf can be its la&s;t, adequate, and proper happine&s;s. Be|cau&s;e, therefore, a great part of our happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e from the contemplation of his being, that he might give our &s;ouls a ju&s;t reli&s;h of &s;uch a contemplation, he has made them naturally delight in the apprehen&s;ion of what is great or unlimited.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE concurrence of two conjunctions, <HI>becau&s;e, therefore,</HI> forms rather a har&s;h and unplea&s;ing beginning of the la&s;t of the&s;e Sentences; and, in the clo&s;e, one would think, that the Author might have devi&s;ed a happier word than <HI>apprehen&s;ion,</HI> to be ap|plied to what is <HI>unlimited.</HI> But that I may not be thought hypercritical, I &s;hall make no farther ob&s;ervation on the&s;e Sentences.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Our admiration, which is a very plea&s;ing motion of the mind, immediately ri&s;es at the con&s;ideration of any object that takes up a good deal of room in the fancy, and,</HI>

<P>HERE, our Author's Style ri&s;es beauti|fully along with the thought. However inaccurate he may &s;ometimes be when coolly philo&s;ophi&s;ing, yet, whenever his fancy is awakened by de&s;cription, or his mind, as here, warmed with &s;ome glowing &s;entiment, he pre&s;ently becomes great, and di&s;covers, in his language, the hand of a ma&s;ter. Every one mu&s;t ob&s;erve, with what felicity this period is con&s;tructed. The words are long and maje&s;tic. The members ri&s;e one above another, and con|duct the &s;entence, at la&s;t, to that full and harmonious clo&s;e, which leaves upon the mind &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion, as the author in|tended to leave, of &s;omething uncommon|ly great, awful, and magnificent.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>He has annexed a &s;ecret plea&s;ure to the idea of any thing that is new or uncommon, that he might encourage us in the pur&s;uit of knowledge, and engage us to &s;earch into the wonders of creation; for every new idea brings &s;uch a plea&s;ure along with it, as rewards the pains we have taken in its acqui&s;ition, and, con&s;equently, &s;erves as a motive to put us upon fre&s;h di&s;coveries.</HI></Q></P>

<P>HERE we mu&s;t, however reluctantly, re|turn to the employment of cen&s;ure: for
<PB N="113" REF="116">
this is among the wor&s;t Sentences our Au|thor ever wrote; and contains a variety of blemi&s;hes. Taken as a whole, it is ex|tremely deficient in unity. In&s;tead of a complete propo&s;ition, it contains a &s;ort of chain of rea&s;oning, the links of which are &s;o ill put together, that it is with difficul|ty we can trace the connection; and, unle&s;s we take the trouble of peru&s;ing it &s;everal times, it will leave nothing on the mind but an indi&s;tinct and ob&s;cure impre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>BESIDES this general fault, re&s;pecting the meaning, it contains &s;ome great inaccu|racies in Language. Fir&s;t, God's having made every thing which <HI>is beautiful in our own &s;pecies</HI> (that is in the human &s;pecies) <HI>plea&s;ant,</HI> is certainly no motive for <HI>all crea|tures,</HI> for bea&s;ts, and birds, and fi&s;hes, <HI>to multiply their kind.</HI> What the Author meant to &s;ay, though he has expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in &s;o erroneous a manner, undoubted|ly was, <Q REND="inline">"In all the different orders of crea|tures, he has made every thing, which is beautiful, in their own &s;pecies, plea&s;ant, that all creatures might be tempted to multiply their kind."</Q> The &s;econd mem|ber of the Sentence is &s;till wor&s;e. <HI>For, it is very remarkable, that wherever nature is cro&s;t in the production of a mon&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. The rea&s;on which he here gives, for the preceding a&s;&s;ertion, intimated by the ca&s;ual particle <HI>for,</HI> is far from being obvious.
<PB N="114" REF="117">
The connection of thought is not readily apparent, and would have required an in|termediate &s;tep, to render it di&s;tinct. But, what does he mean, by <HI>nature being cro&s;t in the production of a mon&s;ter?</HI> One might un|der&s;tand him to mean, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;appointed in its intention of producing a mon&s;ter,"</Q> as when we &s;ay, one is cro&s;t in his pur&s;uits, we mean, that he is di&s;appointed in accom|pli&s;hing the end which he intended. Had he &s;aid, <HI>cro&s;t by the production of a mon&s;ter,</HI> the &s;en&s;e would have been more intelligible. But the proper rectification of the expre&s;&s;ion would be to in&s;ert the adverb <HI>as,</HI> before the prepo&s;ition <HI>in,</HI> after this manner&mdash;<HI>wherever nature is cro&s;t, as in the production of a mon|&s;ter,</HI>&mdash;the in&s;ertion of this particle <HI>as,</HI> throws &s;o much light on the con&s;truction of this member of the &s;entence, that I am very much inclined to believe, it had &s;tood thus, originally, in our Author's manu&s;cript; and that the pre&s;ent reading is a typographical error, which, having crept into the fir&s;t edition of the Spectator, ran through all the &s;ub&s;equent ones.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>In the la&s;t place, he has made every thing that is beautiful, in all other objects, plea&s;ant, or rather has made &s;o many objects appear beautiful, that he might ren|der the whole creation more gay and delightful.

<PB N="115" REF="118">
<HI>and to &s;urvey &s;o many beauties without a &s;ecret &s;a|tisfaction and complacency.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE idea, here, is &s;o ju&s;t, and the Lan|guage &s;o clear, flowing, and agreeable, that, to remark any diffu&s;ene&s;s which may be attributed to the&s;e &s;entences, would be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed hypercritical.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Things would make but a poor appearance to the eye, if we &s;aw them only in their proper figures and motions: and what rea&s;on can we a&s;&s;ign for their exciting, in us, many of tho&s;e ideas which are different from any thing that exi&s;ts in the objects them&s;elves (for &s;uch are light and colours), were it not to add &s;upernumerary ornaments to the univer&s;e, and make it more agreeable to the imagination?</HI></Q></P>
<P>OUR Author is now entering on a theo|ry, which he is about to illu&s;trare, if not with much philo&s;ophical accuracy, yet, with great beauty of fancy, and glow of expre&s;&s;ion. A &s;trong in&s;tance of his want of accuracy, appears in the manner in which he opens the &s;ubject. For what meaning is there in things <HI>exciting in us many of tho&s;e ideas which are different from any thing that exi&s;ts in the objects?</HI> No one, &s;ure, ever imagined, that our ideas exi&s;t in the objects. Ideas, it is agreed on all hands, can exi&s;t no where but in the mind. What Mr. Locke's philo&s;ophy teaches, and what our Author &s;hould have &s;aid, is, <HI>exciting in us many ideas of qualities which are different</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="119">
<HI>from any thing that exi&s;ts in the objects.</HI> The ungraceful parenthe&s;is which follows, <HI>for &s;uch are light and colours,</HI> had far bet|ter have been avoided, and incorporated with the re&s;t of the Sentence, in this man|ner:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"exciting in us many ideas of quali|ties, &s;uch as light and colours, which are different from any thing that exi&s;ts in the objects."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>We are every where entertained with plea&s;ing &s;hows, and apparitions. We di&s;cover imaginary glories in the heavens, and in the earth, and &s;ee &s;ome of this vi&s;iona|ry beauty poured out upon the whole creation; but what a rough un&s;ightly &s;ketch of nature &s;hould we be enter|tained with, did all her colouring di&s;appear, and the &s;e|veral di&s;tinctions of light and &s;hade vani&s;h? In &s;hort, our &s;ouls are delightfully lo&s;t and bewildered in a plea&s;|ing delu&s;ion; and we walk about like the enchanted hero of a romance, who &s;ees beautiful ca&s;tles, woods, and meadows; and, at the &s;ame time, hears the warbling of birds, and the purling of &s;treams; but, upon the fini&s;hing of &s;ome &s;ecret &s;pell, the fanta&s;tic &s;cene breaks up, and the di&s;con&s;olate knight finds him&s;elf on a bar|ren heath, or in a &s;olitary de&s;art.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AFTER having been obliged to point out &s;everal inaccuracies, I return with much more plea&s;ure to the di&s;play of beau|ties, for which we have now full &s;cope; for the&s;e two Sentences are &s;uch as do the highe&s;t honour to Mr. Addi&s;on's ta|lents as a writer. Warmed with the idea he had laid hold of, his delicate &s;en&s;ibility
<PB N="117" REF="120">
to the beauty of nature, is finely di&s;played in the illu&s;tration of it. The Style is flow|ing and full, without being too diffu&s;e. It is flowery, but not gaudy; elevated, but not o&s;tentatious.</P>
<P>AMIDST this blaze of beauties, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us to remark one or two inac|curacies. When it is &s;aid, towards the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e Sentences, <HI>what a rough un&s;ightly &s;ketch of nature &s;hould we be entertained with,</HI> the prepo&s;ition <HI>with,</HI> &s;hould have been placed at the beginning, rather than at the end of this member; and the word <HI>entertained,</HI> is both improperly applied here, and carele&s;sly repeated from the former part of the Sentence. It was there employed according to its more com|mon u&s;e, as relating to agreeable objects. <HI>We are every where entertained with plea&s;ing &s;hows.</HI> Here, it would have been more proper to have changed the phra&s;e, and &s;aid, <HI>with what a rough un&s;ightly &s;ketch of nature &s;hould we be pre&s;ented.</HI>&mdash;At the clo&s;e of the &s;econd Sentence, where it is &s;aid, <HI>the fanta&s;tic &s;cene breaks up,</HI> the expre&s;&s;ion is lively, but not altogether ju&s;tifiable. An a&s;&s;embly <HI>breaks up;</HI> a &s;cene <HI>clo&s;es</HI> or <HI>di&s;ap|pears.</HI></P>
<P>BATING the&s;e two &s;light inaccuracies, the Style, here, is not only correct, but perfectly elegant. The mo&s;t &s;triking beau|ty of the pa&s;&s;age ari&s;es from the happy
<PB N="118" REF="121">
&s;imile which the Author employs, and the fine illu&s;tration which it gives to the thought. The <HI>enchanted hero,</HI> the <HI>beauti|ful ca&s;tles,</HI> the <HI>fanta&s;tic &s;cene,</HI> the <HI>&s;ecret &s;pell,</HI> the <HI>di&s;con&s;olate knight,</HI> are terms cho&s;en with the utmo&s;t felicity, and &s;trongly recal all tho&s;e romantic ideas with which he in|tended to amu&s;e our imagination. Few authors are more &s;ucce&s;sful in their image|ry than Mr. Addi&s;on; and few pa&s;&s;ages in his whrks, or in tho&s;e of any author, are more beautiful and picture&s;que, than that on which we have been commenting.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>It is not improbable, that &s;omething like this may be the &s;tate of the &s;oul after its fir&s;t &s;eparation, in re&s;pect of the images it will receive from matter; though, in|deed, the ideas of colours are &s;o plea&s;ing and beautiful in the imagination, that it is po&s;&s;ible the &s;oul will not be deprived of them, but, perhaps, find them excited by &s;ome other occa&s;ional cau&s;e, as they are, at pre&s;ent, by the different impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ubtile matter on the organ of &s;ight.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As all human things, after having attain|ed the &s;ummit, begin to decline, we mu&s;t acknowledge, that, in this Sentence, there is a &s;en&s;ible falling off from the beauty of what went before. It is broken, and defi|cient in unity. Its parts are not &s;uffici|ently compacted. It contains, be&s;ides, &s;ome faulty expre&s;&s;ions. When it is &s;aid, <HI>&s;omething like this may be the &s;tate of the &s;oul,</HI> to the pronoun <HI>this,</HI> there is no de|termined antecedent; it refers to the gene|ral
<PB N="119" REF="122">
import of the preceding de&s;cription, which, as I have &s;everal times remarked, always renders Style clum&s;y and inelegant, if not ob&s;cure&mdash;<HI>the &s;tate of the &s;oul after its fir&s;t &s;eparation,</HI> appears to be an incomplete phra&s;e, and <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;eems an u&s;ele&s;s, and even an improper word. More di&s;tinct if he had &s;aid,&mdash;<HI>&s;tate of the &s;oul immediately on its &s;eparation from the body</HI>&mdash;the adverb <HI>per|haps,</HI> is redundant, after having ju&s;t before &s;aid, <HI>it is po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>I have here &s;uppo&s;ed, that my reader is acquaint|ed with that great modern di&s;covery, which is, at pre|&s;ent, univer&s;ally acknowledged by all the enquirers into natural philo&s;ophy; namely, that light and colours, as apprehended by the imagination, are only ideas in the mind, and not qualities that have any exi&s;tence in mat|ter. As this is a truth which has been proved incon|te&s;tibly by many modern philo&s;ophers, and is, indeed, one of the fine&s;t &s;peculations in that &s;cience, if the Engli&s;h Reader would &s;ee the notion explained at large, he may find it in the eight chapter of the &s;econd book of Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN the&s;e two concluding Sentences, the Author, ha&s;tening to fini&s;h, appears to write rather carele&s;sly. In the fir&s;t of them, a manife&s;t tautology occurs, when he &s;peaks of what is <HI>univer&s;ally acknowledged by all enquirers.</HI> In the &s;econd, when he calls <HI>a truth which has been inconte&s;tibly proved;</HI> fir&s;t, a <HI>&s;peculation,</HI> and afterwards, <HI>a notion,</HI> the Language &s;urely is not very accurate.
<PB N="120" REF="123">
When he adds, <HI>one of the fine&s;t &s;peculati|ons in that &s;cience,</HI> it does not, at fir&s;t, ap|pear what &s;cience he means. One would imagine, he meant to refer to <HI>modern philo|&s;ophers;</HI> for <HI>natural philo&s;ophy</HI> (to which, doubtle&s;s, he refers) &s;tands at much too great a di&s;tance to be the proper or obvi|ous antecedent to the pronoun <HI>that.</HI> The circum&s;tance towards the clo&s;e, <HI>if the Eng|li&s;h Reader would &s;ee the notion explained at large, he may find it,</HI> is properly taken notice of by the Author of the Elements of Criti|ci&s;m, as wrong arranged; and is rectified thus: <HI>the Engli&s;h Reader, if he would &s;ee the notion explained at large, may find it,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN concluding the Examination of this Paper, we may ob&s;erve, that, though not a very long one, it exhibits a &s;triking view both of the beauties, and the defects, of Mr. Addi&s;on's Style. It contains &s;ome of the be&s;t, and &s;ome of the wor&s;t Sentences, that are to be found in his works. But upon the whole, it is an agreeable and elegant E&s;&s;ay.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXIII. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE STYLE IN No. 414. OF THE SPEC|TATOR.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>IF we con&s;ider the works of Nature and Art, as they are qualified to entertain the imagination, we &s;hall find the la&s;t very defective in compari&s;on of the former; for though they may &s;ometimes appear as beau|tiful or &s;trange, they can have nothing in them of that va&s;tne&s;s and immen&s;ity which afford &s;o great an entertainment to the mind of the beholder.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I HAD occa&s;ion formerly to ob&s;erve, that an introductory Sentence &s;hould always be &s;hort and &s;imple, and contain no more mat|ter than is nece&s;&s;ary for opening the &s;ub|ject. This &s;entence leads to a repetition of this ob&s;ervation, as it contains both an a&s;&s;ertion and the proof of that a&s;&s;ertion; two things which, for the mo&s;t part, but
<PB N="122" REF="125">
e&s;pecially at fir&s;t &s;etting out, are with more advantage kept &s;eparate. It would certainly have been better, if this Sen|tence had contained only the a&s;&s;ertion, end|ing with the word <HI>former:</HI> and if a new one had then begun, entering on the proofs of Nature's &s;uperiority over Art, which is the &s;ubject continued to the end of the pa|ragraph. The proper divi&s;ion of the period I &s;hall point out, after having fir&s;t made a few ob&s;ervations which occur on different parts of it.</P>
<P><HI>If we con&s;ider the works</HI>&mdash;Perhaps it might have been preferable, if our Author had begun, with &s;aying, <HI>When we con&s;ider the works.</HI>&mdash;Di&s;cour&s;e ought always to begin, when it is po&s;&s;ible, with a clear propo&s;ition. The <HI>if,</HI> which is here em|ployed, converts the Sentence into a &s;up|po&s;ition, which is always in &s;ome degree entangling, and proper to be u&s;ed only when the cour&s;e of rea&s;oning renders it ne|ce&s;&s;ary. As this ob&s;ervation however may, perhaps, be con&s;idered as over-refined, and as the &s;en&s;e would have remained the &s;ame in either form of expre&s;&s;ion, I do not mean to charge our Author with any error on this account. We cannot ab&s;olve him from inaccuracy in what immediately follows&mdash;<HI>the works of Nature and Art.</HI> It is the &s;cope of the Author throughout this whole Paper, to compare Nature and Art together, and to oppo&s;e them in &s;everal views to each
<PB N="123" REF="126">
other. Certainly therefore, in the begin|ning, he ought to have kept them as di&s;|tinct as po&s;&s;ible, by interpo&s;ing the prepo|&s;ition, and &s;aying <HI>the works of Nature, and of Art.</HI> As the words &s;tand at pre&s;ent, they would lead us to think that he is go|ing to treat of the&s;e works, not as contra&s;t|ed, but as connected; as united in forming one whole. When I &s;peak of Body and Soul as united in the Human Nature, I would interpo&s;e neither article nor prepo|&s;ition between them; <Q REND="inline">"Man is compound|ed of Soul and Body."</Q> But the ca&s;e is altered, if I mean to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other; then I repre&s;ent them as &s;epa|rate; and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I am to treat of the in|tere&s;ts of the Soul, and of the Body."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Though they may &s;ometimes appear as beau|tiful or &s;trange</HI>&mdash;I cannot help con&s;idering this as a loo&s;e member of the period. It does not clearly appear at fir&s;t what the an|tecedent is to <HI>they.</HI> In reading onwards, we &s;ee the works of Art to be meant; but from the &s;tructure of the Sentence, <HI>they</HI> might be under&s;tood to refer to <HI>the former,</HI> as well as to <HI>the la&s;t.</HI> In what follows, there is a greater ambiguity&mdash;<HI>may &s;ometimes ap|pear as beautiful or &s;trange.</HI> It is very doubtful in what &s;en&s;e we are to under|&s;tand <HI>as,</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age. For, according as it is accented in reading, it may &s;ignify, that <HI>they appear equally beautiful or &s;trange,</HI> to wit, with the works of Nature; and then
<PB N="124" REF="127">
it has the force of the Latin <HI>tam:</HI> or it may &s;ignify no more than that they <HI>appear in the light of beautiful and &s;trange;</HI> and then it has the force of the Latin <HI>tanquam,</HI> with|out importing any compari&s;on. An expre&s;|&s;ion &s;o ambiguous, is always faulty; and it is doubly &s;o here; becau&s;e, if the Author intended the former &s;en&s;e, and meant (as &s;eems mo&s;t probable) to employ <HI>as</HI> for a mark of <HI>compari&s;on,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary to have mentioned both the compared objects; whereas only one member of the compari|&s;on is here mentioned, viz. the works of Art; and if he intended the latter &s;en&s;e, <HI>as</HI> was in that ca&s;e &s;uperfluous and encum|bering, and he had better have &s;aid &s;imply, <HI>appear beautiful or &s;trange.</HI>&mdash;The epithet <HI>&s;trange,</HI> which Mr. Addi&s;on applies to the works of Art, cannot be prai&s;ed. <HI>Strange works,</HI> appears not by any means a happy expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ignify what he here intends, which is new or uncommon.</P>
<P>THE &s;entence concludes with much har|mony and dignity&mdash;<HI>they can have nothing in them of that va&s;tne&s;s and immen&s;ity which afford &s;o great an entertainment to the mind of the beholder.</HI> There is here a fulne&s;s and grandeur of expre&s;&s;ion well &s;uited to the &s;ubject; though, perhaps, <HI>entertainment</HI> is not quite the proper word for expre&s;&s;ing the effect which va&s;tne&s;s and immen&s;ity have upon the mind. Reviewing the ob&s;erva|tions that have been made on this period, it
<PB N="125" REF="128">
might, I think, with advantage, be re&s;olv|ed into two Sentences &s;omewhat after this manner: <Q REND="inline">"When we con&s;ider the works of Nature and of Art, as they are qualified to entertain the imagination, we &s;hall find the latter very defective in compari&s;on of the former.

<P>THIS Sentence is not altogether &s;o cor|rect and elegant as the former.

<P>THERE is nothing in this Sentence to attract particular attention. One would think it was rather the <HI>country,</HI> than a <HI>country life,</HI> on which the remark here made &s;hould re&s;t. A <HI>country life</HI> may, be productive of &s;impli|city of manners, and of other virtues; but it is to <HI>the country</HI> it&s;elf, that the properties here mentioned belong, of di&s;playing the beauties of Nature, and furni&s;hing tho&s;e &s;cenes which delight the imagination.</P>

<P>THE Style in the two Sentences, which compo&s;e this paragraph, is &s;mooth and per|&s;picuous.

<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>If the products of Nature ri&s;e in value, according as they more or le&s;s re&s;emble tho&s;e of Art, we may be &s;ure that artificial works receive a greater advantage from the re&s;emblance of &s;uch as are natural; becau&s;e here the &s;i|militude is not only plea&s;ant, but the pattern more per|fect.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent de&s;ign, to point out two con&s;iderable inaccuracies which occur in this Sentence. <HI>If the pro|ducts</HI> (he had better have &s;aid the <HI>produc|tions</HI>) <HI>of Nature ri&s;e in value, according as they more or le&s;s re&s;emble tho&s;e of Art.</HI>&mdash;Does he mean, that the&s;e productions <HI>ri&s;e in va|lue,</HI> both according as they <HI>more re&s;emble,</HI> and as they <HI>le&s;s re&s;emble,</HI> tho&s;e of Art? His meaning undoubtedly is, that they ri&s;e in
<PB N="130" REF="133">
value only, according as they <HI>more re&s;emble</HI> them: and therefore, either the&s;e words, <HI>or le&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;truck out, or the Sentence mu&s;t run thus&mdash;<HI>productions of Nature ri&s;e or &s;ink in value, according as they more or le&s;s re&s;emble.</HI>&mdash;The pre&s;ent con&s;truction of the Sentence has plainly been owing to ha&s;ty and carele&s;s writing.</P>
<P>THE other inaccuracy is towards the end of the Sentence, and &s;erves to illu&s;trate a rule which I formerly gave, concerning the po&s;ition of adverbs. The Author &s;ays,&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e here, the &s;imilitude is not only plea&s;ant, but the pattern more perfect.</HI> Here, by the po&s;ition of the adverb <HI>only,</HI> we are led to imagine that he is going to give &s;ome other property of the &s;imilitude, that it is <HI>not only plea&s;ant,</HI> as he &s;ays, but more than plea&s;ant; it is u&s;eful, or, on &s;ome account or other, valuable. Whereas, he is going to oppo&s;e another thing to the <HI>&s;imilitude</HI> it&s;elf, and not to this property of its being <HI>plea&s;ant;</HI> and therefore, the right colloca|tion, beyond doubt, was, <HI>becau&s;e here, not only the &s;imilitude is plea&s;ant, but the pattern more perfect:</HI> the contra&s;t lying, not be|tween <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> and <HI>more perfect,</HI> but be|tween <HI>&s;imilitude</HI> and <HI>pattern.</HI>&mdash;Much of the clearne&s;s and neatne&s;s of Style depends on &s;uch attentions as the&s;e.</P>

<P>IN the de&s;cription of the land&s;cape which follows, Mr. Addi&s;on is abundantly happy; but in this introduction to it, he is ob&s;cure and indi&s;tinct. One who had not &s;een the experiment of the Camera Ob&s;cura, could comprehend nothing of what he meant. And even, after we under&s;tand what he points at, we are at &s;ome lo&s;s, whether to under&s;tand his de&s;cription as of one conti|nued land&s;cape, or of two different ones, produced by the projection of two Camera Ob&s;curas on oppo&s;ite walls. The &s;cene, which I am inclined to think Mr. Addi&s;on here refers to, is Greenwich Park, with the pro&s;pect of the Thames, as &s;een by a Camera Ob&s;cura, which is placed in a &s;mall room in the upper &s;tory of the Ob&s;ervatory; where I remember to have &s;een, many years ago, the whole &s;cene here de&s;cribed, corre&s;ponding &s;o much to Mr. Addi&s;on's account of it in this pa&s;&s;age, that, at the time, it recalled it to my memory. As the Ob&s;ervatory &s;tands in the middle of the Park, it overlooks, from one &s;ide, both the river and the park; and the objects after|wards mentioned, the &s;hips, the trees, and the deer, are pre&s;ented in one view, with|out needing any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from oppo&s;ite walls. Put into plainer language, the Sen|tence might run thus: <Q REND="inline">"The prettie&s;t land&s;cape I ever &s;aw, was one formed by

a Camera Ob&s;cura, a common optical in&s;trument, on the wall of a dark room, which overlooked a navigable river and a park."</Q></P>

<P>BATING one or two &s;mall inaccuracies, this is beautiful and lively painting. The principal inaccuracy lies in the connection of the two Sentences, <HI>Here,</HI> and <HI>On another.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the Author meant, on <HI>one &s;ide,</HI> and <HI>on another &s;ide.</HI> As it &s;tands, <HI>another</HI> is ungrammatical, having nothing to which it refers. But the fluctuations of the wa|ter, the &s;hip entering and &s;ailing on by de|grees, the trees waving in the wind, and the herds of deer among them leaping about, is all very elegant, and gives a beau|tiful conception of the &s;cene meant to be de&s;cribed.</P>

But why may not a whole e&s;tate be thrown into a kind of garden by frequent plantations, that may turn as much to the profit as the plea&s;ure of the owner? A mar&s;h overgrown with willows, or a mountain &s;haded with oaks, are not only more beautiful, but more beneficial, than when they lie bare and unadorned. Fields of corn make a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect; and if the walks were a little taken care of that lie between them, and the natural embroidery of the meadows were helped and improved by &s;ome &s;mall additions of art, and the &s;everal rows of hedges were &s;et off by trees and flowers that the &s;oil was capable of receiving, a man might make a pretty land&s;cape of his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE ideas here are ju&s;t, and the Style is ea&s;y and per&s;picuous, though in &s;ome places bordering on the carele&s;s. In that pa&s;&s;age, for in&s;tance, <HI>if the walks were a</HI>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXIV. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE STYLE IN A PASSAGE OF DEAN SWIFT's WRITINGS.</HEAD>
<P>MY de&s;ign, in the four preceding Lec|tures, was not merely to appretiate the merit of Mr. Addi&s;on's Style, by point|ing out the faults and the beauties that are mingled in the writings of that great Au|thor. They were not compo&s;ed with any view to gain the reputation of a Critic; but intended for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch as are de&s;irous of &s;tudying the mo&s;t proper and elegant con&s;truction of Sentences in the Engli&s;h Language. To &s;uch, it is hoped, they may be of advantage; as the proper application of rules re&s;pecting the Style, will always be be&s;t learned by means of the illu&s;tration which examples afford. I conceived that examples, taken from the writings of an Author &s;o ju&s;tly
<PB N="139" REF="142">
e&s;teemed, would, on that account, not on|ly be more attended to, but would al&s;o pro|duce this good effect, of familiari&s;ing tho&s;e who &s;tudy compo&s;ition with the Style of a writer, from whom they may, upon the whole, derive great benefit. With the &s;ame view, I &s;hall, in this Lecture, give one critical exerci&s;e more of the &s;ame kind, upon the Style of an Author of a different character, Dean Swift; repeating the inti|mation I gave formerly, that &s;uch as &s;tand in need of no a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this kind, and who, therefore, will naturally con&s;ider &s;uch minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ions concerning the propriety of words, and &s;tructure of Sen|tences, as beneath their attention, had be&s;t pa&s;s over what will &s;eem to them a tedious part of the work.</P>
<P>I FORMERLY gave the general charac|ter of Dean Swift's Style. He is e&s;teemed one of our mo&s;t correct writers. His Style is of the the plain and &s;imple kind; free of all affectation, and all &s;uperfluity; per|&s;picuous, manly, and pure. The&s;e are its advantages. But we are not to look for much ornament and grace in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am glad to find, that, in my judgment concerning this Author's compo&s;ition, I have coincided with the opinion of a very able critic: <Q REND="inline">"This ea&s;y and &s;afe conveyance of meaning, it was Swift's de&s;ire to attain, and for having attained, he certainly de&s;erves prai&s;e, though, perhaps, not the highe&s;t prai&s;e. For purpo&s;es merely didactic, when &s;omething is to be told that was not known before, it is in the highe&s;t de|gree proper: but again&s;t that inattention by which known truths are &s;uffered to be neglected, it makes no provi&s;ion, it in&s;tructs, but does not per&s;uade." <BIBL>John&s;on's Lives of the Poets; in Swift.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. On the contra|ry,
<PB N="140" REF="143">
Dean Swift &s;eems to have &s;lighted and de&s;pi&s;ed the ornaments of Language, rather than to have &s;tudied them. His arrange|ment is often loo&s;e and negligent. In ele|gant, mu&s;ical, and figurative Language, he is much inferior to Mr. Addi&s;on. His man|ner of writing carries in it the character of one who re&s;ts altogether upon his &s;en&s;e, and aims at no more than giving his mean|ing in a clear and conci&s;e manner.</P>
<P>THAT part of his writings, which I &s;hall now examine, is the beginning of his treati&s;e, entitled, "A Propo&s;al for cor|recting, improving, and a&s;certaining the Engli&s;h Tongue," in a Letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Earl of Oxford, then Lord High Trea&s;urer. I was led, by the nature of the &s;ubject, to choo&s;e this treati&s;e: but, in ju&s;tice to the Dean, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, after having examined it, I do not e&s;teem it one of his mo&s;t correct productions; but am apt to think it has been more ha&s;tily compo&s;ed than &s;ome other of them.

<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>What I had the honour of mentioning to your Lord|&s;hip, &s;ometime ago, in conver&s;ation, was not a new thought, ju&s;t then &s;tarted by accident or occa&s;ion, but the re&s;ult of long reflection; and I have been confirm|ed in my &s;entiments by the opinion of &s;ome very judici|ous per&s;ons with whom I con&s;ulted.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition of circum&s;tances in a Sentence, &s;uch as &s;erve to limit or to quali|fy &s;ome a&s;&s;ertion, or to denote time and place, I formerly &s;howed to be a matter of nicety; and I ob&s;erved, that it ought to be always held a rule, not to crowd &s;uch circum&s;tances together, but rather to inter|mix them with more capital words, in &s;uch different parts of the Sentence as can admit them naturally. Here are two circum|&s;tances of this kind placed together, which had better have been &s;eparated, <HI>Some time ago, in conver&s;ation</HI>&mdash;better thus:&mdash;<HI>What I had the honour, &s;ometime ago, of mentioning to your Lord&s;hip in conver&s;ation&mdash;was not a new thought,</HI> proceeds our Author, <HI>&s;tarted by accident or occa&s;ion:</HI> the dif|ferent meaning of the&s;e two words may not, at fir&s;t, occur. They have, however, a di&s;tinct meaning, and are properly u&s;ed:
<PB N="142" REF="145">
for it is one very laudable property of our Author's Style, that it is &s;eldom incumbered with &s;uperfluous, &s;ynonymous words. <HI>Started by accident,</HI> is, fortuitou&s;ly, or at random; &s;tarted <HI>by occa&s;ion,</HI> is, by &s;ome incident, which at that time gave birth to it. His meaning is, that it was not a new thought which either ca&s;ually &s;prung up in his mind, or was &s;ugge&s;ted to him, for the fir&s;t time, by the train of the di&s;cour&s;e: but, as he adds, <HI>was the re&s;ult of long re|flection.</HI>&mdash;He proceeds:</P>

<P>ONE fault might, perhaps, be found, both with this and the former Sentence, con&s;idered as introductory ones. We ex|pect, that an introduction is to unfold, clearly and directly, the &s;ubject that is to be treated of. In the fir&s;t Sentence, our Author had told us, of a thought he men|tioned to his Lord&s;hip, in conver&s;ation, which had been the re&s;ult of long reflecti|on, and concerning which he had con&s;ult|ed judicious per&s;ons. But what that thought was, we are never told directly. We gather it indeed from the &s;econd &s;en|tence, wherein he informs us, in what the&s;e judicious per&s;ons agreed; namely, that &s;ome method for improving the lan|guage was both u&s;eful and practicable. But this indirect method of opening the &s;ubject, would have been very faulty in a regular treati&s;e; though the ea&s;e of the epi&s;tolary form, which our Author here
<PB N="144" REF="147">
a&s;&s;umes in addre&s;&s;ing his patron, may ex|cu&s;e it in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>I was glad to find your Lord&s;hip's an&s;wer in &s;o differ|ent a &s;tyle from what hath commonly been made u&s;e of, on the like occa&s;ions, for &s;ome years pa&s;t; <Q REND="inline">"That all &s;uch thoughts mu&s;t be deferred to a time of peace;"</Q> a topic which &s;ome have carried &s;o far, that they would not have us, by any means, think of pre&s;erving our civil and religious con&s;titution, becau&s;e we are engaged in a war abroad.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Sentence al&s;o is clear and elegant; only there is one inaccuracy, when he &s;peaks of his Lord&s;hip's <HI>an&s;wer</HI> being in &s;o different a &s;tyle from what had formerly been u&s;ed. His <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to what? or to whom?

<P>THE compliments which the Dean here pays to his patron, are very high and &s;train|ed; and &s;how, that, with all his &s;urline&s;s,
<PB N="146" REF="149">
he was as capable, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, of making his court to a great man by flat|tery, as other writers. However, with re&s;pect to the Style, which is the &s;ole ob|ject of our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, every thing here, as far as appears to me, is fault|le&s;s. In the&s;e Sentences, and, indeed, throughout this paragraph, in general, which we have now ended, our Author's Style appears to great advantage. We &s;ee that ea&s;e and &s;implicity, that correctne&s;s and di&s;tinctne&s;s, which particularly cha|racteri&s;e it. It is very remarkable, how few Latini&s;ed words Dean Swift employs. No writer, in our Language, is &s;o purely Engli&s;h as he is, or borrows &s;o little a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from words of foreign derivation. From none can we take a better model of the choice and proper &s;ignificancy of words. It is remarkable, in the Sentences we have now before us, how plain all the expre&s;|&s;ions are, and yet, at the &s;ame time, how &s;ignificant; and, in the mid&s;t of that high &s;train of compliment into which he ri&s;es, how little there is of pomp, or glare of ex|pre&s;&s;ion. How very few writers can pre|&s;erve this manly temperance of Style; or would think a compliment of this nature &s;upported with &s;ufficient dignity, unle&s;s they had embelli&s;hed it with &s;ome of tho&s;e high &s;ounding words, who&s;e chief effect is no other than to give their Language a &s;tiff and forced appearance?</P>

<Q REND="inline"><HI>My Lord, I do here, in the name of all the learned and polite per&s;ons of the nation, complain to your Lord|&s;hip, as Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, that our Language is extremely imperfect; that its daily improvements are by no means in proportion to its daily corruptions; that the pretenders to poli&s;h and refine it, have chiefly multiplied abu&s;es and ab&s;urdities; and that, in many in&s;tances, it offends again&s;t every part of grammar.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE turn of this Sentence is extremely elegant. He had &s;poken before of a griev|ance for which he &s;ought redre&s;s, and he carries on the allu&s;ion, by entering, here, directly on his &s;ubject, in the Style of a public repre&s;entation pre&s;ented to the Mi|ni&s;ter of State. One imperfection, how|ever, there is in this Sentence, which, luckily for our purpo&s;e, &s;erves to illu&s;trate a rule before given, concerning the po&s;i|tion of adverbs, &s;o as to avoid ambiguity. It is in the middle of the Sentence;&mdash;<HI>that the pretenders to poli&s;h and refine it, have chiefly multiplied abu&s;es and ab&s;urdities.</HI>&mdash;Now, concerning the import of this adverb, <HI>chiefly,</HI> I a&s;k, whether it &s;ignifies that the&s;e pretenders to poli&s;h the Language, have been the <HI>chief per&s;ons</HI> who have multiplied its abu&s;es, in di&s;tinction <HI>from others;</HI> or, that the <HI>chief thing</HI> which the&s;e pretenders have done, is to multiply the abu&s;es of our Language, in oppo&s;ition to their <HI>doing any thing to refine it?</HI> The&s;e two meanings are really different; and yet, by the po&s;ition which the word <HI>chiefly</HI> has in the Sentence,
<PB N="148" REF="151">
we are left at a lo&s;s in which to under&s;tand it. The con&s;truction would lead us rather to the latter &s;en&s;e; that the chief thing which the&s;e pretenders have done, is to multiply the abu&s;es of our Language. But it is more than probable, that the former &s;en&s;e was what the Dean intended, as it carries more of his u&s;ual &s;atirical edge; <Q REND="inline">"that the pretended refiners of our Lan|guage were, in fact, its chief corruptors;"</Q> on which &s;uppo&s;ition, his words ought to have run thus: <HI>that the pretenders to poli&s;h and refine it, have been the chief per&s;ons to multiply its abu&s;es and ab&s;urdities;</HI> which would have rendered the &s;en&s;e perfectly clear.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, too, there might be ground for ob&s;erving farther upon this Sentence, that as Language is the object with which it &s;ets out; <HI>that our Language is extremely imperfect;</HI> and then follows an enumeration concerning Language, in three particulars, it had been better if Language had been kept the ruling word, or the nominative to every verb, without changing the &s;cene; by making <HI>pretenders</HI> the ruling word, as is done in the &s;econd member of the enu|meration, and then, in the third, returning again to the former word, <HI>Language&mdash;That the pretenders to poli&s;h&mdash;and that, in many in&s;tances, it offends</HI>&mdash;I am per&s;uaded, that the &s;tructure of the Sentence would have been more neat and happy, and its unity
<PB N="149" REF="152">
more complete, if the members of it had been arranged thus: <Q REND="inline">"That our Language is extremely imperfect; that its daily improvements are by no means in pro|portion to its daily corruptions; that, in many in&s;tances, it offends again&s;t eve|ry part of grammar; and that the pre|tenders to poli&s;h and refine it, have been the chief per&s;ons to multiply its abu&s;es and ab&s;urdities."</Q>&mdash;This degree of at|tention &s;eemed proper to be be&s;towed on &s;uch a Sentence as this, in order to &s;how how it might have been conducted after the mo&s;t perfect manner. Our Author, after having &s;aid,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Le&s;t your Lord&s;hip &s;hould think my cen&s;ure too &s;evere, I &s;hall take leave to be more par|ticular;</HI></Q> proceeds in the following para|graph:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>I believe your Lord&s;hip will agree with me, in the rea&s;on why our Language is le&s;s refined than tho&s;e of Italy, Spain, or France.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I AM &s;orry to &s;ay, that now we &s;hall have le&s;s to commend in our Author. For the whole of this paragraph, on which we are entering, is, in truth, perplexed and in|accurate. Even, in this &s;hort Sentence, we may di&s;cern an inaccuracy&mdash;<HI>why our Language is le&s;s refined than tho&s;e of Italy, Spain, and France;</HI> putting the pronoun <HI>tho&s;e</HI> in the plural, when the antecedent
<PB N="150" REF="153">
&s;ub&s;tantive tow hich it refers is in the &s;ingu|lar, <HI>our Language.</HI> In&s;tances of this kind may &s;ometimes be found in Engli&s;h au|thors; but they &s;ound har&s;h to the ear, and are certainly contrary to the purity of gram|mar By a very little attention, this inac|curacy could have been remedied; and the Sentence have been made to run much bet|ter in this way; <Q REND="inline">"why our Language is le&s;s refined than the Italian, Spani&s;h, or French."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>It is plain, that the Latin Tongue, in its purity, was never in this i&s;land; towards the conque&s;t of which, few or no attempts were made till the time of Claudius; neither was that Language ever &s;o vulgar in Britain, as it is known to have been in Gaul and Spain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To &s;ay, that <HI>the Latin Tongue, in its pu|rity was never in this i&s;land,</HI> is very care|le&s;s Style; it ought to have been, <HI>was never &s;poken in this i&s;land.</HI> In the progre&s;s of the Sentence, he means to give a rea&s;on why the Latin was never &s;poken in its pu|rity among&s;t us, becau&s;e our i&s;land was not conquered by the Romans till after the pu|rity of their Tongue began to decline. But this rea&s;on ought to have been brought out more clearly. This might ea&s;ily have been done, and the relation of the &s;everal parts of the Sentence to each other much better pointed out by means of a &s;mall va|riation; thus: <Q REND="inline">"It is plain, that the Latin Tongue, in its purity, was never &s;poken
<PB N="151" REF="154">
in this i&s;land, as few or no attempts to|wards the conque&s;t of it were made till the time of Claudius."</Q> He adds, <HI>Nei|ther was the Language ever &s;o vulgar in Britain.&mdash;Vulgar</HI> was one of the wor&s;t words he could have cho&s;en for expre&s;&s;ing what he means here; namely, that the Latin Tongue was at no time &s;o <HI>general,</HI> or &s;o much in <HI>common u&s;e,</HI> in Britain, as it is known to have been in Gaul and Spain.&mdash;<HI>Vulgar,</HI> when applied to Language, com|monly &s;ignifies impure, or deba&s;ed Lan|guage, &s;uch as is &s;poken by the low people, which is quite oppo&s;ite to the Author's &s;en&s;e here; for, in place of meaning to &s;ay, that the Latin &s;poken in Britain was not &s;o deba&s;ed, as what was &s;poken in Gaul and Spain; he means ju&s;t the contrary, and had been telling us, that we never were acquainted with the Latin at all, till its purity began to be corrupted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Further, we find that the Roman legions here were at length all recalled to help their country again&s;t the Goths, and other barbarous invaders.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE chief &s;cope of this Sentence is, to give a rea&s;on why the Latin Tongue did not &s;trike any deep root in this i&s;land, on account of the &s;hort continuance of the Romans in it. He goes on:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Meantime the Britons, left to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and daily hara&s;&s;ed by cruel inroads from the Picts, were</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="155">
<HI>forced to call in the Saxons for their defence; who, con|&s;equently, reduced the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land to their own power, drove the Britons into the mo&s;t remote and mountainous parts, and the re&s;t of the country, in cu&s;|toms, religion, and language, became wholly Saxon.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS is a very exceptionable &s;entence. Fr&s;t, the phra&s;e <HI>left to &s;hift for them&s;elves,</HI> is rather a low phra&s;e, and too much in the familiar Style to be proper in a grave treati&s;e. Next, as the Sentence advances&mdash;<HI>forced to call in the Saxons for their defence, who, con|&s;equently, reduced the greate&s;t part of the i&s;l|and to their own power.</HI>&mdash;What is the mean|ing of <HI>con&s;equently</HI> here? if it means <Q REND="inline">"af|terwards,"</Q> or <Q REND="inline">"in progre&s;s of time,"</Q> this, certianly, is not a &s;en&s;e in which <HI>con&s;equent|ly</HI> is often taken; and therefore the expre&s;|&s;ion is chargeable with ob&s;curity. The ad|verb, <HI>con&s;equently,</HI> in its mo&s;t common accep|tation, denotes one thing following from another, as an effect from a cau&s;e. If he u&s;es it in this &s;en&s;e, and means that the Britons being &s;ubdued by the Saxons, was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of their having called in the the&s;e Saxons to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tane, this con&s;equence is drawn too ab|ruptly, and needed more explanation. For though it has often happened, that nations have been &s;ubdued by their own auxiliaries, yet this is not a con&s;equence of &s;uch a na|ture that it can be a&s;&s;umed, as &s;eems here to be done, for a fir&s;t and &s;elf-evident prin|ciple.&mdash;But further, what &s;hall we &s;ay to this phra&s;e, <HI>reduced the greate&s;t part of the</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="156">
<HI>i&s;land to their own power?</HI> we &s;ay <HI>reduce to rule, reduce to practice</HI>&mdash;we can &s;ay, that <HI>one nation reduces another to &s;ubjection</HI>&mdash;But when <HI>dominion</HI> or <HI>power</HI> is u&s;ed, we always, as far as I know, &s;ay, <HI>reduce under their power. Re|duce to their power,</HI> is &s;o har&s;h and uncom|mon an expre&s;&s;ion, that, though Dean Swift's authority in language be very great, yet, in the u&s;e of this phra&s;e, I am of opi|nion, that it would not be &s;afe to follow his example.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e particular inaccuracies, this Sentence is chargeable with want of uni|ty in the compo&s;ition of the whole. The per&s;ons and the &s;cene are too often changed upon us&mdash;Fir&s;t, the Britons are mentioned, who are harra&s;&s;ed by inroads from the Picts; next, the Saxons appear, who &s;ubdue the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land, and drive the Britons into the mountains; and, la&s;tly, the re&s;t of the country is introduced, and a de&s;cription given of the change made up|on it. All this forms a groupe of various objects, pre&s;ented in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the mind finds it difficult to compre|hend them under one view. Accordingly, it is quoted in the <HI>Elements of Critici&s;m,</HI> as an in&s;tance of a &s;entence rendered faulty by the breach of unity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>This I take to be the rea&s;on why there are more Latin words remaining in the Briti&s;h than the old Sax|on; which, excepting &s;ome few variations in the ortho|graphy, is the &s;ame in mo&s;t original words with our pre|&s;ent</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="157">
<HI>Engli&s;h, as well as with the German and other northern dialects.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Sentence is faulty, &s;omewhat in the &s;ame manner with the la&s;t. It is loo&s;e in the connection of its parts; and, be&s;ides this, it is al&s;o too loo&s;ely connected with the preceding &s;entence. What he had there &s;aid, concerning the Saxons expelling the Britons, and changing the cu&s;toms, the religi|on, and the language of the country, is a clear and good rea&s;on for our pre&s;ent language being Saxon rather than Briti&s;h. This is the inference which we would naturally ex|pect him to draw from the premi&s;es ju&s;t be|fore laid down: But when he tells us, that <HI>this is the rea&s;on why there are more Latin words remaining in the Briti&s;h tongue than in the old Saxon,</HI> we are pre&s;ently at a &s;tand. No rea&s;on for this inference appears. If it can be gathered at all from the foreign de|duction, it is gathered only imperfectly. For, as he had told us, that the Britons had <HI>&s;ome</HI> conection with the Romans, he &s;hould have al&s;o told us, in order to make out his inference, that the Saxons never had <HI>any.</HI> The truth is, the whole of this paragraph concerning the influence of the Latin tongue upon ours, is carele&s;s, perplexed, and ob&s;cure. His argument required to have been more fully unfolded, in order to make it be di&s;tinctly apprehended, and to give it its due force. In the next para|graph, he proceeds to di&s;cour&s;e concerning
<PB N="155" REF="158">
the influence of the French tongue upon our language. The Style becomes more clear, though not remarkable for great beauty or elegance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or having lived long in France, appears to be the fir&s;t who introduced any mixture of the French tongue with the Saxon; the court affecting what the Prince was fond of, and others taking it up for a fa&s;hion, as it is now with us. William the Conqueror proceeded much further, bringing over with him va&s;t num|bers of that nation, &s;cattering them in every mona&s;tery, giving them great quantities of land, directing all plead|ings to be in that language, and endeavouring to make it univer&s;al in the kingdom.</HI></Q></P>
<P>ON the&s;e two Sentences, I have nothing of moment to ob&s;erve. The &s;en&s;e is brought out clearly, and in &s;imple, unaf|fected language.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>This, at lea&s;t, is the opinion generally received; but your Lord&s;hip hath fully convinced me, that the French tongue made yet a greater progre&s;s here under Harry the Second, who had large territories on that continent both from his father and his wife; made frequent journeys and expeditions thither; and was always attended with a number of his countrymen, retainers at court.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN the beginning of this Sentence, our Author &s;tates an oppo&s;ition between an opi, nion generally received, and that of his Lord&s;hip; and in compliment to his patron, he tells us, that his Lord&s;hip had convinced
<PB N="156" REF="159">
him of &s;omewhat that differed from the ge|neral opinion. Thus one mu&s;t naturally under&s;tand his words: <HI>This, at lea&s;t, is the opinion generally received; but your Lord&s;hip hath fully convinced me</HI>&mdash;Now here there mu&s;t be an inaccuracy of expre&s;&s;ion. For on examining what went before, there appears no &s;ort of oppo&s;ition betwixt the generally received opinion, and that of the Author's patron. The general opinion was, that William the Conqueror had proceeded much farther than Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, in propagating the French language, and had endeavoured to make it univer&s;al. Lord Oxford's opinion was, that the French tongue had gone on to make a yet greater progre&s;s under Harry the Second, than it had done under his predece&s;&s;or William: which two opinions are as entirely con&s;i&s;|tent with one another, as any can be; and therefore the oppo&s;ition here affected to be &s;tated between them, by the adver&s;ative particle <HI>but,</HI> was improper and ground|le&s;s.</P>

THIS is a Sentence too long and intri|cate, and liable to the &s;ame objection that was made to a former one, of the want of unity. It con&s;i&s;ts of four members, each divided from the &s;ub&s;equent by a &s;emico|lon. In going along, we naturally expect the Sentence is to end at the &s;econd of the&s;e, or, at farthe&s;t, at the third; when, to our &s;urpri&s;e, a new member pops out upon us, and fatigues our attention in join|ing all the parts together. Such a &s;truc|ture of a Sentence is always the mark of carele&s;s writing. In the fir&s;t member of the Sentence, <HI>a con&s;tant intercour&s;e between France and England, by the dominions we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed there, and the conque&s;ts we made,</HI> the con&s;truction is not &s;ufficiently filled up.

<P>I SHALL not pur&s;ue this critici&s;m any further. I have been obliged to point out many inaccuracies in the pa&s;&s;age which we have con&s;idered. But, in order that my ob&s;ervations may not be con&s;tructed as meant to depreciate the Style or the Writ|ings of Dean Swift below their ju&s;t value, there are two remarks, which I judge it nece&s;&s;ary to make before concluding this Lecture. One is, That it were unfair to e&s;timate an Author's Style on the whole, by &s;ome pa&s;&s;age in his writings, which chances to be compo&s;ed in a carele&s;s man|ner. This is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to this treati&s;e, which has much the appearance of a ha&s;ty production; though, as I before ob&s;erved, it was by no means on that ac|count that I pitched upon it for the &s;ubject of this exerci&s;e. But after having examin|ed it, I am &s;en&s;ible that, in many other of his writings, the Dean is more accurate.</P>
<P>MY other ob&s;ervation, which applies equally to Dean Swift and Mr. Addi&s;on, is, that there may be writers much freer of &s;uch inaccuracies, as I have had occa&s;ion to point out in the&s;e two, who&s;e Style, however, upon the whole, may not have half their merit. Refinement in Language has, of late years, begun to be much at|tended
<PB N="163" REF="166">
to. In &s;everal modern productions of very &s;mall value, I &s;hould find it diffi|cult to point out many errors in Language. The words might, probably, be all proper words, correctly and clearly arranged; and the turn of the &s;entence &s;onorous and mu|&s;ical; whil&s;t yet the Style, upon the whole, might de&s;erve no prai&s;e. The fault often lies in what may be called the general ca&s;t, or complexion of the Style; which a per|&s;on of a good ta&s;te di&s;cerns to be vicious; to be feeble, for in&s;tance, and diffu&s;e; flim&s;y or affected; petulant or o&s;tentatious; though the faults cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily point|ed out and particulari&s;ed, as when they lie in &s;ome erroneous, or negligent con&s;truc|tion of a &s;entence. Whereas, &s;uch writers as Addi&s;on and Swift, carry always tho&s;e general characters of good Style, which, in the mid&s;t of their occa&s;ional negligences, every per&s;on of good ta&s;te mu&s;t di&s;cern and approve. We &s;ee their faults overbalanced by higher beauties. We &s;ee a writer of &s;en&s;e and reflection expre&s;&s;ing his &s;enti|ments without affectation, attentive to thoughts as well as to words; and, in the main current of his Language, elegant and beautiful; and, therefore, the only proper u&s;e to be made of the blemi&s;hes which oc|cur in the writings of &s;uch authors, is to point out to tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of compo&s;ition, &s;ome of the rules which they ought to ob&s;erve for avoiding &s;uch errors; and to render them &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="164" REF="167">
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;trict attention to Language and to Style. Let them imitate the ea&s;e and &s;implicity of tho&s;e great authors; let them &s;tudy to be always natural, and, as far as they can, always correct in their ex|pre&s;&s;ions; let them endeavour to be, at &s;ome times, lively and &s;triking; but care|fully avoid being at any time o&s;tentatious and affected.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXV. ELOQUENCE, OR PUBLIC SPEAK|ING.&mdash;HISTORY OF ELOQUENCE&mdash;GRECIAN ELOQUENCE.&mdash;DE|MOSTHENES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed that part of the Cour&s;e which relates to Language and Style, we are now to a&s;cend a &s;tep higher, and to examine the &s;ubjects upon which Style is employed. I begin with what is properly called Eloquence, or Pub|lic Speaking. In treating of this, I am to con&s;ider the different kinds and &s;ubjects of Public Speaking; the manner &s;uited to each; the proper di&s;tribution and manage|ment of all the parts of a di&s;cour&s;e; and the proper pronunciation or delivery of it. But before entering on any of the&s;e heads, it may be proper to take a view of the na|ture of Eloquence in general, and of the &s;tate in which it has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in different ages and countries. This will lead into
<PB N="166" REF="169">
&s;ome detail; but I hope an u&s;eful one; as in every art it is of great con&s;equence to have a ju&s;t idea of the perfection of the art, of the end at which it aims, and of the progre&s;s which it has made among man|kind.</P>
<P>OF Eloquence, in particular, it is the more nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the proper no|tion, becau&s;e there is not any thing con|cerning which fal&s;e notions have been more prevalent. Hence, it has been &s;o often, and is &s;till at this day, in di&s;repute with many. When you &s;peak to a plain man of Eloquence, or in prai&s;e of it, he is apt to hear you with very little attention. He conceives Eloquence to &s;ignify a certain trick of Speech; the art of varni&s;hing weak arguments plau&s;ibly; or of &s;peaking &s;o as to plea&s;e and tickle the ear. <Q REND="inline">"Give me good &s;en&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"and keep your Eloquence for boys."</Q> He is in the right, if Eloquence were what he conceives it to be. It would be then a very contemptible art indeed, below the &s;tudy of any wi&s;e or good man. But nothing can be more re|mote from truth. To be truly eloquent, is to &s;peak to the purpo&s;e. For the be&s;t de|finition which, I think, can be given of Eloquence, is, the Art of Speaking in &s;uch a manner as to attain the end for which we &s;peak. Whenever a man &s;peaks or writes, he is &s;uppo&s;ed, as a rational being, to have &s;ome end in view; either to inform, or to
<PB N="167" REF="170">
amu&s;e, or to per&s;uade, or, in &s;ome way or other, to act upon his fellow-creatures. He who &s;peaks, or writes, in &s;uch a manner as to adapt all his words mo&s;t effectually to that end, is the mo&s;t eloquent man. What|ever then the &s;ubject be, there is room for Eloquence; in hi&s;tory, or even in philo&s;o|phy, as well as in orations. The definition which I have given of Eloquence, compre|hends all the different kinds of it; whether calculated to in&s;truct, to per&s;uade, or to plea&s;e. But, as the mo&s;t important &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e is Action, or Conduct, the power of Eloquence chiefly appears when it is employed to influence Conduct, and per&s;uade to Action. As it is principally, with reference to this end, that it becomes the object of Art, Eloquence may, under this view of it, be defined, The Art of Per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, certain con&s;equences immediately follow, which point out the fundamental maxims of the Art. It follows clearly, that, in order to per&s;uade, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites are, &s;olid argument, clear method, a character of probity appearing in the Speaker, joined with &s;uch graces of Style and utterance, as &s;hall draw our attention to what he &s;ays. Good &s;en&s;e is the foundation of all. No man can be truly eloquent without it; for fools can per&s;uade none but fools. In or|der to per&s;uade a man of &s;en&s;e, you mu&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="171">
fir&s;t convince him; which is only to be done, by &s;atisfying his under&s;tanding of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of what you propo&s;e to him.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to ob&s;erve, that convin|cing and per&s;uading, though they are &s;ome|times confounded, import, notwith&s;tand|ing, different things, which it is nece&s;&s;ary for us, at pre&s;ent, to di&s;tingui&s;h from each other. Conviction affects the under&s;tand|ing only; per&s;ua&s;ion, the will and the practice. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the philo&s;o|pher to convince me of truth; it is the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the orator to per&s;uade me to act agreeably to it, by engaging my affections on its &s;ide. Conviction, and per&s;ua&s;ion, do not always go together. They <HI>ought,</HI> indeed, to go together; and <HI>would</HI> do &s;o, if our inclination regularly followed the dic|tates of our under&s;tanding. But as our na|ture is con&s;tituted, I may be convinced, that virtue, ju&s;tice, or public &s;pirit, are laudable, while, at the &s;ame time, I am not per&s;uaded to act according to them. The inclination may revolt, though the under|&s;tanding be &s;atisfied: the pa&s;&s;ions may pre|vail again&s;t the judgment. Conviction is, however, always one avenue to the incli|nation, or heart; and it is that which an Orator mu&s;t fir&s;t bend his &s;trength to gain: for no per&s;ua&s;ion is likely to be &s;table, which is not founded on conviction. But, in order to per&s;uade, the Orator mu&s;t go
<PB N="169" REF="172">
farther than merely producing conviction; he mu&s;t con&s;ider man as a creature moved by many different &s;prings, and mu&s;t act upon them all. He mu&s;t addre&s;s him&s;elf to the pa&s;&s;ions; he mu&s;t paint to the fancy, and touch the heart; and, hence, be&s;ides &s;olid argument, and clear method, all the conciliating and intere&s;ting arts, both of Compo&s;ition and Pronunciation, enter into the idea of Eloquence.</P>
<P>AN objection may, perhaps, hence be formed again&s;t Eloquence; as an Art which may be employed for per&s;uading to ill, as well as to good. There is no doubt that it may; and &s;o rea&s;oning may al&s;o be, and too often is employed, for leading men into er|ror. But who would think of forming an argument from this again&s;t the cultivation of our rea&s;oning powers? Rea&s;on, Elo|quence, and every Art which ever has been &s;tudied among mankind, may be abu&s;ed, and may prove dangerous in the hands of bad men; but it were perfectly childi&s;h to contend, that, upon this account, they ought to be abrogated. Give truth and vir|tue the &s;ame arms which you give vice and fal&s;ehood, and the former are likely to pre|vail. Eloquence is no invention of the &s;chools. Nature teaches every man to be eloquent, when he is much in earne&s;t. Place him in &s;ome critical &s;ituation; let him have &s;ome great intere&s;t at &s;take, and you will &s;ee him lay hold of the mo&s;t effec|tual
<PB N="170" REF="173">
means of per&s;ua&s;ion. The Art of Ora|tory propo&s;es nothing more than to follow out that track which Nature has fir&s;t point|ed out to men. And the more exactly that this track is pur&s;ued, the more that Elo|quence is properly &s;tudied, the more &s;hall we be guarded again&s;t the abu&s;e which bad men make of it, and enabled the better to di&s;tingui&s;h between true Eloquence and the tricks of Sophi&s;try.</P>
<P>WE may di&s;tingui&s;h three kinds, or de|grees of Eloquence. The fir&s;t, and lowe&s;t, is that which aims only at plea&s;ing the hearers. Such, generally, is the Eloquence of panegyricks, inaugural orations, addre&s;|&s;es to great men, and other harangues of this &s;ort. This ornamental &s;ort of eompo|&s;ition is not altogether to be rejected. It may innocently amu&s;e and entertain the mind; and it may be mixed, at the &s;ame time, with very u&s;eful &s;entiments. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that where the Speak|er has no farther aim than merely to &s;hine and to plea&s;e, there is great danger of Art being &s;trained into o&s;tentation, and of the compo&s;ition becoming tire&s;ome and lan|guid.</P>
<P>A SECOND and a higher degree of lo|quence is, when the Speaker aims not me|rely to plea&s;e, but al&s;o to inform, to in&s;truct, to convince: when his Art is exerted, in re|moving prejudiees again&s;t him&s;elf and his
<PB N="171" REF="174">
cau&s;e, in chu&s;ing the mo&s;t proper argu|ments, &s;tating them with the greate&s;t force, arranging them in the be&s;t order, expre&s;&s;ing and delivering them with propriety and beauty; and thereby di&s;po&s;ing us to pa&s;s that judgment, or embrace that &s;ide of the cau&s;e, to which he &s;eeks to bring us. With|in this compa&s;s, chiefly, is employed the Eloquence of the bar.</P>
<P>BUT there is a third, and &s;till higher de|gree of Eloquence, wherein a greater pow|er is exerted over the human mind; by which we are not only convinced, but are intere&s;ted, agitated, and carried along with the Speaker; our pa&s;&s;ions are made to ri&s;e together with his; we enter into all his e|motions; we love, we dete&s;t, we re&s;ent, ac|cording as he in&s;pires us; and are prompted to re&s;olve, or to act, with vigour and warmth. Debate, in popular a&s;&s;emblies, opens the mo&s;t illu&s;trious field to this &s;pecies of Elo|quence; and the pulpit, al&s;o, admits it.</P>
<P>I AM here to ob&s;erve, and the ob&s;ervati|on is of con&s;equence, that the high Elo|quence which I have la&s;t mentioned, is al|ways the offspring of pa&s;&s;ion. By pa&s;&s;ion, I mean that &s;tate of the mind in which it is agitated, and fired, by &s;ome object it has in view. A man may convince, and even per|&s;uade others to act, by mere rea&s;on and argument. But that degree of Eloquence which gains the admiration of mankind, and
<PB N="172" REF="175">
properly denominates one an Orator, is ne|ver found without warmth or pa&s;&s;ion. Pa&s;|&s;ion, when in &s;uch a degree as to rou&s;e and kindle the mind, without throwing it out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf, is univer&s;ally found to exalt all the human powers. It renders the mind infinitely more enlighten|ed, more penetrating, more vigorous and ma&s;terly, than it is in its calm moments. A man, actuated by a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, becomes much greater than he is at other times. He is con&s;cious of more &s;trength and force; he utters greater &s;entiments, conceives higher de&s;igns, and executes them with a bold|ne&s;s and a felicity, of which, on other oc|ca&s;ions, he could not think him&s;elf capable. But chiefly, with re&s;pect to per&s;ua&s;ion, is the power of pa&s;&s;ion felt. Almo&s;t every man, in pa&s;&s;ion, is eloquent. Then, he is at no lo&s;s for words and arguments. He tran&s;mits to others, by a &s;ort of contagious &s;ympathy, the warm &s;entiments which he feels; his looks and ge&s;tures are all per&s;ua|&s;ive; and Nature here &s;hows her&s;elf infinite|ly more powerful than all art. This is the foundation of that ju&s;t and noted rule: <Q REND="inline">"Si vis me flere, dolendum e&s;t primum ip&s;i tibi."</Q></P>
<P>THIS principle being once admitted, that all high Eloquence flows from pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eve|ral con&s;equences follow, which de&s;erve to be attended to; and the mention of which will &s;erve to confirm the principle it&s;elf.
<PB N="173" REF="176">
For hence, the univer&s;ally acknowledged effect of enthu&s;ia&s;m, or warmth of any kind, in public Speakers, for affecting their audience. Hence all laboured declamation, and affected ornaments of Style, which &s;hew the mind to be cool and unmoved, are &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with per&s;ua&s;ive Eloquence. Hence all &s;tudied prettine&s;&s;e&s;s, in ge&s;ture or pronunciation, detract &s;o greatly from the weight of a Speaker. Hence a di&s;|cour&s;e that is read, moves us le&s;s than one that is &s;poken, as having le&s;s the appear|ance of coming warm from the heart. Hence, to call a man cold, is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that he is not eloquent. Hence a &s;ceptical man, who is always in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and feels nothing &s;trongly; or a cunning mercenary man, who is &s;u&s;pected rather to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of pa&s;&s;ion than to feel it; have &s;o little power over men in Public Speaking.

<P>THESE are &s;ome of the capital ideas which have occured to me, concerning Eloquence in general; and with which I have thought proper to begin, as the foun|dation of much of what I am afterwards to &s;ugge&s;t. From what I have already &s;aid, it is evident that Eloquence is a high ta|lent, and of great importance in &s;ociety; and that it requires both natural genius,
<PB N="174" REF="177">
and much improvement from Art. Viewed as the Art of Per&s;ua&s;ion, it requires, in its lowe&s;t &s;tate, &s;oundne&s;s of under&s;tanding, and con&s;iderable acquaintance with human nature; and, in its higher degrees, it re|quires, moreover, &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility of mind, a warm and lively imagination, joined with correctne&s;s of judgment, and an exten&s;ive command of the power of Language; to which mu&s;t al&s;o be added, the graces of Pronunciation and Delivery.&mdash;Let us next proceed, to con&s;ider in what &s;tate Elo|quence has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in different ages and nations.</P>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation made by &s;everal writers, that Eloquence is to be looked for only in free &s;tates. Longinus, in particu|lar, at the end of his treati&s;e on the Sub|lime, when a&s;&s;igning the rea&s;on why &s;o little &s;ublimity of genius appeared in the age wherein he lived, illu&s;trates this ob&s;er|vation with a great deal of beauty. Liber|ty, he remarks, is the nur&s;e of true genius; it animates the &s;pirit, and invigorates the hopes of men; excites honourable emula|tion, and a de&s;ire of excelling in every Art. All other qualifications, he &s;ays, you may find among tho&s;e who are deprived of li|berty; but never did a &s;lave become an orator; he can only be a pompous flatterer. Now, though this rea&s;oning be, in the main true; it mu&s;t, however, be under|&s;tood with &s;ome limitations. For, under
<PB N="175" REF="178">
arbitrary governments, if they be of the ci|vili&s;ed kind, and give encouragement to the arts, ornamental Eloquence may flouri&s;h remarkably. Witne&s;s France at this day, where, ever &s;ince the reign of Louis XIV., more of what may ju&s;tly be called Eloquence, within a certain &s;phere, is to be found, than, perhaps, in any other nation of Europe; though free|dom be enjoyed by &s;ome of them in a much greater degree. Their &s;ermons, and orations pronounced on publick occa&s;ions, are not only polite and elegant harangues, but &s;everal of them are uncommonly &s;pirit|ed, animated with bold figures, and ri&s;e to a degree of the Sublime. Their Eloquence, however, in general, mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be of the flowery, rather than the vigorous kind; calculated more to plea&s;e and &s;oothe, than to convince and per&s;uade. High, manly, and forcible Eloquence is, indeed, to be looked for only, or chiefly, in the re|gions of freedom. Under arbitrary govern|ments, be&s;ides the general turn of &s;oftne&s;s and effeminacy which &s;uch governments may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to give to the &s;pirit of a nation, the art of &s;peaking cannot be &s;uch an in&s;trument of ambition, bu&s;ine&s;s, and power, as it is in more democratical &s;tates. It is confifed within a narrower range; it can be exerted only in the pulpit, or at the bar; but is excluded from tho&s;e great &s;cenes of public bu&s;ine&s;s, where the &s;pirits of men have the free&s;t play; where
<PB N="176" REF="179">
important affairs are tran&s;acted, and per|&s;ua&s;ion of cour&s;e, is more &s;eriou&s;ly &s;tudied. Wherever man can acquire mo&s;t power over man by means or rea&s;on and di&s;cour&s;e, which certainly is under a free &s;tate of go|vernment, there we may naturally expect that true Eloquence will be be&s;t under|&s;tood, and carried to the greate&s;t height.</P>
<P>HENCE, in tracing the ri&s;e of Oratory, we need not attempt to go far back into the early ages of the world, or &s;earch for it among the monuments of Ea&s;tern or Egyp|tian antiquity. In tho&s;e ages, there was, indeed, an Eloquence of a certain kind; but it approached nearer to Poetry, than to what we properly call Oratory. There is rea&s;on to believe, as I formerly &s;hewed, that the Language of the fir&s;t ages was pa&s;|&s;ionate and metaphorical; owing partly to the &s;canty &s;tock of words, of which Speech then con&s;i&s;ted; and partly to the tincture which Language naturally takes from the &s;avage and uncultivated &s;tate of men, agi|tated by unre&s;trained pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;truck by events, which to them are &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing. In this &s;tate, rapture and en|thu&s;ia&s;m, the parents of Poetry, had an ample field. But while the intercour&s;e of men was as yet unfrequent, and force and &s;trength were the chief means employed in deciding controver&s;ies, the arts of Oratory and Per&s;ua&s;ion, of Rea&s;oning and Debate, could be but little known. The fir&s;t empires
<PB N="177" REF="180">
that aro&s;e, the A&s;&s;yrian and Egyptian, were of the de&s;potic kind. The whole power was in the hands of one, or at mo&s;t of a few. The multitude were accu&s;tomed to a blind reverence: they were led, not per&s;uaded; and none of tho&s;e refinements of &s;ociety, which make public &s;peaking an object of importance, were as yet intro|duced.</P>
<P>IT is not till the ri&s;e of the Grecian Re|publics, that we find any remarkable ap|pearances of Eloquence as the art of per|&s;ua&s;ion; and the&s;e gave it &s;uch a field as it never had before, and, perhaps, has never had again &s;ince that time. And, therefore, as the Grecian Eloquence has ever been the object of admiration to tho&s;e who have &s;tudied the powers of Speech, it is nece&s;|&s;ary, that we fix our attention, for a little, on this period.</P>
<P>GREECE was divided into a multitude of petty &s;tates. The&s;e were governed, at fir&s;t, by kings who were called Tyrants, and who being, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, expelled from all the&s;e &s;tates, there &s;prung up a great number of democratical governments, &s;ounded near|ly on the &s;ame plan, animated by the &s;ame high &s;pirit of freedom, mutually jealous, and rivals of each other. We may compute the flouri&s;hing period of tho&s;e Grecian &s;tates, to have la&s;ted from the battle of Ma|rathon, till the time of Alexander the
<PB N="178" REF="181">
Great, who &s;ubdued the liberties of Greece; a period which comprehends about 150 years, and within which are to be found mo&s;t of their celebrated poets and philo&s;o|phers, but chiefly their Orators: for though poetry and philo&s;ophy were not extinct among them after that period, yet Elo|quence hardly made any figure.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e Grecian Republics, the mo&s;t noted, by far, for Eloquence, and, indeed, for arts of every kind, was that of Athens. The Athenians were an ingenious, quick, &s;prightly people; practi&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;harpened by frequent and &s;udden revolu|tions, which happened in their government. The genius of their government was en|tirely democratical; their legi&s;lature con|&s;i&s;ted of the whole body of the people. They had, indeed, a Senate of five hun|dred; but in the general convention of the citizens was placed the la&s;t re&s;ort; and af|fairs were conducted there, altogether, by rea&s;oning, &s;peaking, and a &s;kilful applica|tion to the pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts of a popu|lar a&s;&s;embly. There, laws were made, peace and war decreed, and thence the magi&s;trates were cho&s;en. For the highe&s;t honours of the &s;tate were alike open to all; nor was the meane&s;t trade&s;man excluded from a &s;eat in their &s;upreme courts. In &s;uch a &s;tate, Eloquence, it is obvious, would be much &s;tudied, as the &s;ure&s;t means of ri&s;ing to influence and power; and what
<PB N="179" REF="182">
&s;ort of Eloquence? Not that which was brilliant merely, and &s;howy, but that which was found, upon trial, to be mo&s;t effectual for convincing, intere&s;ting, and per&s;uad|ing the hearers. For there, public &s;peak|ing was not a mere competition for empty applau&s;e, but a &s;erious contention for that public leading, which was the great object both of the men of ambition, and the men of virtue.</P>
<P>AMONG a nation &s;o enlightened and acute, and where the highe&s;t attention was paid to every thing elegant in the arts, we may naturally expect to find the public ta&s;te refined and judicious. Accordingly, it was improved to &s;uch a degree, that the Attic ta&s;te and Attic manner have pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb. It is true, that ambitious demagogues, and corrupt orators, did &s;ome|times dazzle and mi&s;lead the people, by a &s;howy but fal&s;e Eloquence; for the Athe|nians, with all their acutene&s;s, were fac|tious and giddy, and great admirers of eve|ry novelty. But when &s;ome important in|tere&s;t drew their attention, when any great danger rou&s;ed them, and put their judg|ment to a &s;erious trial, they commonly di&s;|tingui&s;hed, very ju&s;tly, between genuine and &s;purious Eloquence: and hence De|mo&s;thenes triumphed over all his oppo|nents; becau&s;e he &s;poke always to the pur|po&s;e, affected no in&s;ignificant parade of words, u&s;ed weighty arguments, and &s;hew|ed
<PB N="180" REF="183">
them clearly where their intere&s;t lay. In critical conjunctures of the &s;tate, when the public was alarmed with &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing danger, when the people were a&s;&s;embled, and proclamation was made by the crier, for any one to ri&s;e and deliver his opinion upon the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, empty declamation and &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;oning would not only have been hi&s;&s;ed, but re&s;ented and puni&s;hed by an a&s;&s;embly &s;o intelligent and accu&s;tomed to bu&s;ine&s;s. Their great|e&s;t Orators trembled on &s;uch occa&s;ions, when they ro&s;e to addre&s;s the people, as they knew they were to be held an&s;werable for the i&s;&s;ue of the coun&s;el which they gave. The mo&s;t liberal endowments of the greate&s;t princes never could found &s;uch a &s;chool for true oratory, as was formed by the nature of the Athenian Republic. Eloquence there &s;prung, native and vigo|rous, from amid&s;t the contentions of fac|tion and freedom, of public bu&s;ine&s;s, and of active life; and not from that retire|ment and &s;peculation, which we are apt &s;ometimes to fancy more favourable to Eloquence than they are found to be.</P>
<P>PYSISTRATUS, who was cotemporary with Solon, and &s;ubverted his plan of go|vernment, is mentioned by Plutarch, as the fir&s;t who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf among the Athenians by application to the Arts of Speech. His ability in the&s;e arts, he employed for rai&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;ove|reign
<PB N="181" REF="184">
power; which, however, when he had attained, he exerci&s;ed with moderation. Of the Orators who flouri&s;hed between his time and the Peloponne&s;ian war, no par|ticular mention is made in hi&s;tory. Peri|cles, who died about the beginning of that war, was properly the fir&s;t who carried Eloquence to a great height; to &s;uch a height indeed, that it does not appear he was ever afterwards &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. He was more than an Orator; he was al&s;o a State&s;|man and a General; expert in bu&s;ine&s;s, and of con&s;ummate addre&s;s. For forty years, he governed Athens with ab&s;olute &s;way; and hi&s;torians a&s;cribe his influence, not more to his political talents than to his Eloquence, which was of that forcible and vehement kind, that bore every thing before it, and triumphed over the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the people. Hence he had the &s;urname of Olympias given him: and it was &s;aid, that, like Jupiter, he thundered when he &s;poke. Though his ambition be liable to cen&s;ure, yet great virtues certainly he had; and it was the confidence which the people repo&s;ed in his integrity, that gave &s;uch power to his Eloquence; a circum&s;tance, without which the influence of public &s;peaking in a po|pular &s;tate can &s;eldom go far. He appears to have been generous, magnanimous, and public &s;pirited: he rai&s;ed no fortune to him&s;elf; he expended indeed great &s;ums of the public money, but chiefly on pub|lic
<PB N="182" REF="185">
works; and at his death is &s;aid to have valued him&s;elf principally on having ne|ver obliged any citizen to wear mourn|ing on his account, during his long admi|ni&s;tration. It is a remarkable particular recorded of Pericles by Suidas, that he was the fir&s;t Athenian who compo&s;ed, and put into writing, a di&s;cour&s;e de&s;igned for the public.</P>
<P>POSTERIOR to Pericles, in the cour&s;e of the Peloponne&s;ian war, aro&s;e Cleon, Alcibiades, Critias, and Theramenes, emi|nent citizens of Athens, who were all di&s;|tingui&s;hed for their Eloquence. They were not Orators by profe&s;&s;ion; they were not formed by &s;chools, but by a much more powerful education, that of bu&s;ine&s;s and debate; where man &s;harpened man, and civil affairs carried on by public &s;peak|ing, called forth every exertion of the mind. The manner or &s;tyle of Oratory which then prevailed, we learn from the Orations in the hi&s;tory of Thucydides, who al&s;o flouri&s;hed in the &s;ame age. It was manly, vehement, and conci&s;e, even to &s;ome degree of ob&s;curity. <Q REND="inline">"Grandes erant verbis,"</Q> &s;ays Cicero, <Q REND="inline">"crebri &s;en|tentiis, compre&s;&s;ione rerum breves, et, ob eam ip&s;am cau&s;am, interdum &s;ubob|&s;curi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"They were magnificent in their expre&s;&s;ions; they abounded in thought; they compre&s;&s;ed their matter into few words, and, by their brevity, were &s;ometimes ob|&s;cure."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> A manner very different from
<PB N="183" REF="186">
what in modern times we would conceive to be the Style of popular Oratory; and which tends to give a high idea of the acutene&s;s of th&s;oe audiences to which they &s;poke.</P>
<P>THE power of Eloquence having, after the days of Pericles, become an object of greater con&s;equence than ever, this gave birth to a &s;et of men till then unknown, called Rhetoricians, and &s;ometimes Sophi&s;ts, who aro&s;e in multitudes during the Pelopon|ne&s;ian war; &s;uch as Protagoras, Prodicas, Thra&s;ymus, and one who was more emi|nent than all the re&s;t, Gorgias of Leontium. The&s;e Sophi&s;ts joined to their art of rheto|ric a &s;ubtile logic, and were generally a &s;ort of metaphy&s;ical Sceptics. Gorgias, how|ever, was a profe&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter of Eloquence only. His reputation was prodigious. He was highly venerated in Leontium of Sicily, his native city; and money was coined with his name upon it. In the latter part of his life, he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at Athens, and lived till he had attained the age of 105 years. Hermogenes (de Ideis, l. ii. cap. 9.) has pre|&s;erved a fragment of his, from which we &s;ee his &s;tyle and manner. It is extremely quaint and artificial; full of antithe&s;is and pointed expre&s;&s;ion; and &s;hows how far the Grecian &s;ubtilty had already carried the &s;tudy of language. The&s;e Rhetoricians did not content them&s;elves with delivering ge|neral in&s;tructions concerning Eloquence to
<PB N="184" REF="187">
their pupils, and endeavouring to form their ta&s;te; but they profe&s;&s;ed the art of giving them receipts for making all &s;orts of Orati|ons; and of teaching them how to &s;peak for, and again&s;t, every cau&s;e whatever. Upon this plan, they were the fir&s;t who treated of common places, and the artificial invention of arguments and topics for every &s;ubject. In the hands of &s;uch men, we may ea&s;ily believe that Oratory would dege|nerate from the ma&s;culine &s;train it had hi|therto held, and become a trifling and &s;o|phi&s;tical art: and we may ju&s;tly deem them the fir&s;t corrupters of true Eloquence. To them, the great Socrates oppo&s;ed him&s;elf. By a profound, but &s;imple rea&s;oning pecu|liar to him&s;elf, he exploded their &s;ophi&s;try; and endeavoured to recall men's attention from that abu&s;e of rea&s;oning and di&s;cour&s;e which began to be in vogue, to natural lan|guage, and &s;ound and u&s;eful thought.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame age, though &s;omewhat later than the philo&s;opher above-mentioned, flouri&s;hed I&s;ocrates, who&s;e writings are &s;till extant. He was a profe&s;&s;ed Rhetorician, and by teaching Eloquence, he acquired both a great fortune, and higher fame than any of his rivals in that profe&s;&s;ion. No con|temptible Orator he was. His orations are full of morality and good &s;entiments: they are flowing and &s;mooth; but too de&s;titute of vigour. He never engaged in public affairs, nor pleaded cau&s;es; and accordingly his
<PB N="185" REF="188">
orations are calculated only for the &s;hade: <Q REND="inline">"Pompae,"</Q> Cicero allows, <Q REND="inline">"magis quam pugnae aptior; ad voluptatem aurium ac|commodatus potius quam ad judiciorum certamen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"More fitted for &s;how than for debate; better calculated for the amu&s;ement of an audience, than for judicial conte&s;ts."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The Style of Gorgias of Leontium was formed into &s;hort &s;entences, compo&s;ed generally of two members balanc|ed again&s;t each other. The Style of I&s;ocra|tes, on the contrary, is &s;welling and full; and he is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t who introduc|ed the method of compo&s;ing in regular pe|riods, which had a &s;tudied mu&s;ic and har|monious cadence; a manner which he has carried to a vicious exce&s;s. What &s;hall we think of an orator, who employed ten years in compo&s;ing one di&s;cour&s;e, &s;till extant, en|titled the Panegyric? How much frivolous care mu&s;t have been be&s;towed on all the minute elegance of words and &s;entences? Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us has given us upon the orations of I&s;ocrates, as al&s;o upon tho&s;e of &s;ome other Greek orators, a full and re|gular treati&s;e, which is, in my opinion, one of the mo&s;t judicious pieces of ancient critici&s;m extant, and very worthy of being con&s;ulted. He commends the &s;plendor of I&s;ocrates's Style, and the morality of his &s;en|timents; but &s;everely cen&s;ures his affecta|tion, and the uniform regular cadence of all his &s;entences. He holds him to be a florid declaimer; not a natural per&s;ua&s;ive &s;peak|er.
<PB N="186" REF="189">
Cicero, in his critical works, though he admits his failings, yet di&s;covers a pro|pen&s;ity to be very favourable to that <Q REND="inline">"ple|na ac numero&s;a oratio,"</Q> that &s;welling and mu&s;ical &s;tyle, which I&s;ocrates intro|duced; and with the love of which, Cice|ro him&s;elf was, perhaps, &s;omewhat infect|ed. In one of his Treati&s;e (Orat. ad M. Brut.) he informs us, that his friend Brutus and he differed in this particular, and that Brutus found fault with his partiality to I&s;ocrates. The manner of I&s;ocrates gene|rally catches young people, when they be|gin to attend to compo&s;ition; and it is very natural that it &s;hould do &s;o. It gives them an idea of that regularity, cadence, and magnificence of &s;tyle, which fills the ear: but when they come to write or &s;peak for the world, they will find this o&s;tentatious manner unfit, either for carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s, or commanding attention. It is &s;aid, that the high reputation of I&s;ocrates prompted Ari&s;totle, who was nearly his cotemporary, or lived but a little after him, to write his in&s;titutions of Rhetoric; which are indeed formed upon a plan of Eloquence very dif|ferent from that of I&s;ocrates, and the Rhe|toricians of that time. He &s;eems to have had it in view to direct the attention of ora|tors much more towards convincing and af|fecting their hearers, than towards the mu|&s;ical cadence of periods.</P>

Never had ora|tor a finer field than Dome&s;thenes in his Olynthiacs and Philippics, which are his capital Orations; and, no doubt, to the noblene&s;s of the &s;ubject, and to that in|tegrity and public &s;pirit which eminently breathe in them, they are indebted for much of their merit. The &s;ubject, is to rouze the indignation of his countrymen again&s;t Philip of Macedon, the public enemy of the liberties of Greece; and to guard them again&s;t the in&s;idious mea&s;ures, by which that crafty Prince endeavoured to lay them a&s;leep to danger. In the pro&s;ecution of this end, we &s;ee him taking every proper method to animate a people, renowned for ju&s;tice, humanity, and valour, but in many in|&s;tances become corrupt and degenerate. He boldly taxes them with their venality,
<PB N="190" REF="193">
their indolence, and indifference to the public cau&s;e; while, at the &s;ame time, with all the art of an Orator, he recals the glory of their ance&s;tors to their thoughts, &s;hows them that they are &s;till a flouri&s;hing and a powerful people, the natural protec|tors of the liberty of Greece, and who wanted only the inclination to exert them|&s;elves, in order to make Philip tremble. With his cotemporary orators, who were in Philip's intere&s;t, and who per&s;uaded the people to peace, he keeps no mea&s;ures, but plainly reproaches them as the betrayers of their country. He not only prompts to vigorous conduct, but he lays down the plan of that conduct; he enters into parti|culars; and points out, with great exact|ne&s;s, the mea&s;ures of execution. This is the &s;train of the&s;e orations. They are &s;trongly animated; and full of the impe|tuo&s;ity and fire of public &s;pirit. They proceed in a continued train of inductions, con&s;equences, and demon&s;trations, found|ed on &s;ound rea&s;on. The figures which he u&s;es, are never &s;ought after; but always ri&s;e from the &s;ubject. He employs them &s;paringly indeed; for &s;plendor and orna|ment are not the di&s;tinctions of this Orator's compo&s;ition. It is an energy of thought peculiar to him&s;elf, which forms his cha|racter, and &s;ets him above all others. He appears to attend much more to things than to words. We forget the orator, and think of the bu&s;ine&s;s. He warms the mind, and
<PB N="191" REF="194">
impels to action. He has no parade and o&s;|tentation; no methods of in&s;inuation; no laboured introductions; but is like a man full of his &s;ubject, who, after preparing his audience by a &s;entence or two for hear|ing plain truths, enters directly on bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>DEMOSTHENES appears to great advan|tage, when contra&s;ted with Ae&s;chines in the celebrated oration "pro Corona." Ae&s;|chines was his rival in bu&s;ine&s;s, and per|&s;onal enemy; and one of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Orators of that age. But when we read the two orations, Ae&s;chines is feeble in compari&s;on of Domo&s;thenes, and makes much le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. His rea&s;onings concerning the law that was in que&s;tion, are indeed very &s;ubtile; but his invective again&s;t Demo&s;thenes is general, and ill &s;upported. Whereas Demo&s;thenes is a torrent, that nothing can re&s;i&s;t. He bears down his antagoni&s;t with violence; he draws his character in the &s;tronge&s;t co|lours; and the particular merit of that oration is, that all the de&s;criptions in it are highly picture&s;que. There runs through it a &s;train of magnanimity and high ho|nour: the Orator &s;peaks with that &s;trength and con&s;cious dignity which great actions and public &s;pirit alone in&s;pire. Both Ora|tors u&s;e great liberties with one another; and in general, that unre&s;trained licence which ancient manners permitted, even to
<PB N="192" REF="195">
the length of abu&s;ive names and downright &s;currility, as appears both here and in Ci|cero's Philippics, hurts and offends a mo|dern ear. What tho&s;e ancient Orators gained by &s;uch a manner in point of free|dom and boldne&s;s, is more than compen|&s;ated by want of dignity; which &s;eems to give an advantage, in this re&s;pect, to the greater decency of modern &s;peaking.</P>
<P>THE Style of Demo&s;thenes is &s;trong and conci&s;e, though &s;ometimes, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled, har&s;h and abrupt. His words are very expre&s;&s;ive; his arrangement is firm and manly; and, though far from being unmu&s;ical, yet it &s;eems difficult to find in him that &s;tudied, but concealed number, and Rythmus, which &s;ome of the ancient critics are fond of attributing to him. Ne|gligent of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er graces, one would rather conceive him to have aimed at that Sublime which lies in &s;entiment. His acti|on and pronunciation are recorded to have been uncommonly vehement and ardent; which, from the manner of his compo&s;ition, we are naturally led to believe. The cha|racter which one forms of him, from read|ing his works, is of the au&s;tere, rather than the gentle kind. He is, on every oc|ca&s;ion, grave, &s;erious, pa&s;&s;ionate; takes e|very thing on a high tone; never lets him|&s;elf down, nor attempts any thing like plea|&s;antry. If any fault can be found to his
<PB N="193" REF="196">
admirable Eloquence, it is, that he &s;ome|times borders on the hard and dry. He may be thought to want &s;moothne&s;s and grace; which Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us attributes to his imitating too clo&s;ely the manner of Thucydides, who was his great model for Style, and who&s;e hi&s;|tory he is &s;aid to have written eight times over with his own hand. But the&s;e defects are far more than compen|&s;ated, by that admirable and ma&s;terly force of ma&s;culine Eloquence, which, as it over|powered all who heard it, cannot, at this day, be read without emotion.</P>
<P>AFTER the days of Demo&s;thenes, Greece lo&s;t her liberty, Eloquence of cour&s;e lan|gui&s;hed, and relap&s;ed again into the feeble manner introduced by the Rhetoricians and Sophi&s;ts. Demetrius Phalerius, who lived in the next age to Demo&s;thenes, attained indeed &s;ome character, but he is repre&s;ent|ed to us as a flowery, rather than a per|&s;ua&s;ive &s;peaker, who aimed at grace rather than &s;ub&s;tance. <Q REND="inline">"Delectabat Athenien&s;es,"</Q> &s;ays Cicero, <Q REND="inline">"magis quam inflammabat."</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"He amu&s;ed the Athenians, rather than warmed them."</Q> And after his time, we hear of no more Grecian Orators of any note.</P>

<P>HAVING treated of the ri&s;e of Elo|quence, and of its &s;tate among the Greeks, we now proceed to con&s;ider its progre&s;s among the Romans, where we &s;hall find one model, at lea&s;t, of Eloquence, in its mo&s;t &s;plendid and illu&s;trious form. The Romans were long a martial nation, altogether rude, and un&s;killed in arts of any kind.

<P>AS the Romans derived their Eloquence, Poetry, and Learning from the Greeks, &s;o they mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be far inferior to them in genius for all the&s;e accompli&s;h|ments. They were a more grave and mag|nificent, but a le&s;s acute and &s;prightly peo|ple.

And hence, when we compare together the various rival productions of Greece and Rome, we &s;hall always find this di&s;tinction obtain, that in the Greek productions there is more native genius; in the Roman, more regularity and art. What the Greeks invented, the Romans poli&s;hed; the one was the original, rough &s;ometimes, and in|correct; the other, a fini&s;hed copy.</P>
<P>AS the Roman government, during the republic, was of the popular kind, there is no doubt but that, in the hands of the leading men, public &s;peaking became early an engine of government, and was em|ployed for gaining di&s;tinction and power. But in the rude unpoli&s;hed times of the State, their &s;peaking was hardly of that &s;ort that could be called Eloquence. Though Cicero, in his Treati&s;e "de Claris Oratoribus," endeavours to give &s;ome reputation to the elder Cato, and tho&s;e who were his contemporaries, yet he ac|knowledges it to have been <Q REND="inline">"A&s;perum et horridum genus dicendi,"</Q> a rude and har&s;h &s;train of &s;peech. It was not till a &s;hort time preceding Cicero's age, that the Roman Orators ro&s;e into any note. Cra&s;&s;us and Antonius, two of the Speakers in the dialogue De Oratore, appear to have been the mo&s;t eminent, who&s;e different man|ners Cicero de&s;cribes with great beauty in that dialogue, and in his other rhe|torical works. But as none of their productions
<PB N="197" REF="200">
are extant, nor any of Horten|&s;ius's, who was Cicero's cotemporary and rival at the bar, it is needle&s;s to tran&s;cribe from Cicero's writings the account which he gives of tho&s;e great men, and of the character of their Eloquence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as are de&s;irous of particular information on this head, had better have recour&s;e to the original, by reading Cicero's three books De Oratore, and his other two treati&s;es, entitled the one, Brutus, Sive de Claris Oratoribus; the other Orator, ad M. Brutum; which, on &s;everal accounts, well de|&s;erve peru&s;al.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE object in this period, mo&s;t worthy to draw our attention, is Cicero him&s;elf; who&s;e name alone &s;ugge&s;ts every thing that is &s;plendid in Oratory. With the hi&s;tory of his life, and with his character, as a man and a politician, we have not at pre|&s;ent any direct concern. We con&s;ider him only as an eloquent Speaker; and, in this view, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to remark both his virtues, and his defects, if he has any. His virtues are, beyond controver&s;y, emi|nently great. In all his Orations there is high art. He begins, generally, with a regular exordium; and with much prepa|ration and in&s;inuation prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the hear|ers, and &s;tudies to gain their affections. His method is clear, and his arguments are arranged with great propriety. His me|thod is indeed more clear than that of De|mo&s;thenes; and this is one advantage which he has over him. We find every thing in
<PB N="198" REF="201">
its proper place; he never attempts to move, till he has endeavoured to convince; and in moving, e&s;pecially the &s;ofter pa&s;|&s;ions, he is very &s;ucce&s;sful. No man, that ever wrote, knew the power and force of words better than Cicero. He rolls them along with the greate&s;t beauty and pomp; and, in the &s;tructure of his &s;entences, is curious and exact to the highe&s;t degree. He is always full and flowing, never ab|rupt. He is a great amplifier of every &s;ub|ject; magnificent, and in his &s;entiments highly moral. His manner is on the whole diffu&s;e, yet it is often happily varied, and &s;uited to the &s;ubject. In his four orations, for in&s;tance, again&s;t Catiline, the tone and &s;tyle of each of them, particularly the fir&s;t and la&s;t, is very different, and accommo|dated with a great deal of judgment to the occa&s;ion, and the &s;ituation in which they were &s;poken. When a great public object rou&s;ed his mind, and demanded indigna|tion and force, he departs con&s;iderably from that loo&s;e and declamatory man|ner to which he inclines at other times, and becomes exceedingly cogent and ve|hement. This is the ca&s;e in his Orations again&s;t Anthony, and in tho&s;e two again&s;t Verres and Catiline.</P>
<P>TOGETHER with tho&s;e high qualities which Cicero po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he is not exempt from certain defects, of which it is nece&s;&s;ary to take notice. For the Ciceronian Elo|quence
<PB N="199" REF="202">
is a pattern &s;o dazzling by its beau|ties, that, if not examined with accuracy and judgment, it is apt to betray the un|wary into a faulty imitation; and I am of opinion, that it has &s;ometimes produced this effect. In mo&s;t of his Orations, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e compo&s;ed in the earlier part of his life, there is too much art; even car|ried the length of o&s;tentation. There is too vi&s;ible a parade of Eloquence. He &s;eems often to aim at obtaining admiration, rather than at operating conviction, by what he &s;ays. Hence, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, he is &s;howy rather than &s;olid; and diffu&s;e, where he ought to have been pre&s;&s;ing. His &s;entences are, at all times, round and &s;o|norous; they cannot be accu&s;ed of mono|tony, for they po&s;&s;e&s;s variety of cadence; but, from too great a &s;tudy of magnificence, he is &s;ometimes deficient in &s;trength. On all occa&s;ions, where there is the lea&s;t room for it, he is full of him&s;elf. His great ac|tions, and the real &s;ervices which he had performed to his country, apologize for this in part; ancient manners, too, im|po&s;ed fewer re&s;traints from the &s;ide of de|corum; but, even after the&s;e allowances made, Cicero's o&s;tentation of him&s;elf can|not be wholly palliated; and his Orations, indeed all his works, leave on our minds the impre&s;&s;ion of a good man, but withal, of a vain man.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203">
THE defects which we have now taken notice of in Cicero's Eloquence, were not unob&s;erved by his own cotemporaries. This we learn from Quinctilian, and from the author of the dialogue, "de Cau&s;is Cor|ruptae Eloquentiae," Brutus, we are in|formed, called him, <Q REND="inline">"fractum et elum|bem,"</Q> broken and enervated. <Q REND="inline">"Suorum temporum homines,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"in|ce&s;&s;ere audebant eum ut tumidiorem &amp; A&s;ianum, et redundantem, et in repititi|onibus nimium, et in &s;alibus aliquando fri|gidum, &amp; in compo&s;itione fractum et ex&s;ul|tantem, &amp; pene viro molliorem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"His cotemporaries ventured to reproach him as &s;well|ing, redundant and A&s;iatic; too frequent in repetitions; in his attempts towards wit &s;ometimes cold; and, in the &s;train of his compo&s;ition, feeble, de&s;ultory, and more effe|minate than became a man."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The&s;e cen&s;ures were undoubtedly carried too far; and &s;avour of malignity and per&s;onal enmi|ty. They &s;aw his defects, but they aggrava|ted them; and the&s;o urce of the&s;e aggravati|ons can be traced to the difference which prevailed in Rome, in Cicero's days, be|tween two great parties, with re&s;pect to Eloquence. The <Q REND="inline">"Attici,"</Q> and the <Q REND="inline">"A&s;iani."</Q> The former, who called them|&s;elves the Attics, were the patrons of what they conceived to be the cha&s;te, &s;imple, and natural Style of Eloquence; from which they accu&s;ed Cicero as having departed, and as leaning to the florid A&s;iatic manner. In &s;everal of his rhetorical works, particularly
<PB N="201" REF="204">
in his "Orator ad Brutum," Cicero, in his turn, endeavours to expo&s;e this &s;ect, as &s;ub&s;tituting a frigid and jejune manner, in place of the true Attic Eloquence; and con|tends, that his own compo&s;ition was form|ed upon the real Attic Style. In the 10th Chapter of the la&s;t Book of Quinctilian's In&s;titutions, a full account is given of the di&s;putes between the&s;e two parties; and of the Rhodian, or middle manner between the Attics and the A&s;iatics. Quinctilian him&s;elf declares on Cicero's &s;ide; and, whe|ther it be called Attic or A&s;iatic, prefers the full, the copious, and the amplifying Style. He concludes with this very ju&s;t ob&s;ervati|on: <Q REND="inline">"Plures &s;unt eloquentiae facies; &s;ed &s;tulti&s;&s;imum e&s;t quaerere, ad quam rectu|rus &s;e &s;it orator; cum omnis &s;pecies, quae modo recta e&s;t, habeat u&s;um.&mdash;Utetur enim, ut res exiget, omnibus; nec pro cau&s;&acirc; modo, &s;ed pro partibus cau&s;ae<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Eloquence admits of many different forms; and no|thing can be more fooli&s;h than to enquire, by which of them an Orator is to regulate his Compo&s;ition; &s;ince every form, which is in it&s;elf ju&s;t, has its own place and u&s;e. The Orator, according as circum&s;tances require, will em|ploy them all; &s;uiting them not only to the cau&s;e or &s;ub|ject of which he treats, but to the different parts of that &s;ubject."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of comparing Cicero and Demo&s;thenes, much has been &s;aid by criti|cal writers. The different manners of the&s;e two Princes of Eloquence, and the
<PB N="202" REF="205">
di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of each, are &s;o &s;trongly marked in their writings, that the compari&s;on is, in many re&s;pects, obvious and ea&s;y. The character of Demo&s;thenes is vigour and au&s;terity; that of Cicero is gentlene&s;s and in&s;inuation. In the one, you find more manline&s;s, in the other, more ornament. The one is more har&s;h, but more &s;pirited and cogent; the other more agreeable, but withal, loo&s;er and weaker.</P>
<P>To account for this difference, without any prejudice to Cicero, it has been &s;aid, that we mu&s;t look to the nature of their different auditories; that the refined Athe|nians followed with ea&s;e the conci&s;e and convincing Eloquence of Demo&s;thenes; but that a manner more popular, more flowery, and declamatory, was requi&s;ite in &s;peak|ing to the Romans, a people le&s;s acute, and le&s;s acquainted with the arts of &s;peech. But this is not &s;atisfactory. For we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Greek Orator &s;poke much oftener before a mixed multitude, than the Roman. Almo&s;t all the public bu&s;ine&s;s of Athens was tran&s;acted in popular A&s;&s;em|blies. The common people were his hear|ers, and his judges. Whereas Cicero ge|nerally addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <Q REND="inline">"Patres Con&s;cripti,"</Q> or in criminal trials to the Praetor, and the Select Judges; and it can|not be imagined, that the per&s;ons of high|e&s;t rank, and be&s;t education in Rome, re|quired
<PB N="203" REF="206">
a more diffu&s;e manner of pleading than the common citizens of Athens, in order to make them under&s;tand the cau&s;e, or reli&s;h the Speaker. Perhaps we &s;hall come nearer the truth, by ob&s;erving, that to unite together all the qualities, without the lea&s;t exception, that form a perfect Orator, and to excel equally in each of tho&s;e qualities, is not to be expected from the limited powers of human genius. The highe&s;t degree of &s;trength is, I &s;u&s;pect, ne|ver found united with the highe&s;t degree of &s;moothne&s;s and ornament; equal atten|tions to both are incompatible; and the genius that carries ornament to its utmo&s;t length, is not of &s;uch a kind, as can excel as much in vigour. For there plainly lies the characteri&s;tical difference between the&s;e two celebrated Orators.</P>
<P>IT is a di&s;advantage to Demo&s;thenes, that, be&s;ides his conci&s;ene&s;s, which &s;ome|times produces ob&s;curity, the language, in which he writes, is le&s;s familiar to mo&s;t of us than the Latin, and that we are le&s;s ac|quainted with the Greek antiquities than we are with the Roman. We read Cicero with more ea&s;e, and of cour&s;e with more plea&s;ure. Independent of this circum&s;tance too, he is no doubt, in him&s;elf, a more agreeable writer than the other. But not|with&s;tanding this advantage, I am of opi|nion, that were the &s;tate in danger, or &s;ome great public intere&s;t at &s;take, which
<PB N="204" REF="207">
drew the &s;erious attention of men, an Ora|tion in the &s;pirit and &s;train of Demo&s;thenes, would have more weight, and produce greater effects than one in the Ciceronian manner. Were Demo&s;thenes's Philippics &s;poken in a Briti&s;h A&s;&s;embly, in a &s;imilar conjuncture of affairs, they would convince and per&s;uade at this day. The rapid Style, the vehement rea&s;oning, the di&s;dain, an|ger, boldne&s;s, freedom, which perpetually animate them, would render their &s;ucce&s;s infallible over any modern A&s;&s;embly. I que&s;tion whether the &s;ame can be &s;aid of Cicero's Orations; who&s;e Eloquence, how|ever beautiful, and however well &s;uited to the Roman ta&s;te, yet borders oftener on de|clamation, and is more remote from the manner in which we now expect to hear real bu&s;ine&s;s and cau&s;es of importance treated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this judgment, I concur with Mr. David Hume, in his E&s;&s;ay upon Eloquence. He gives it as his opinion, that, of all human productions, the Orations of Demo&s;thenes pre&s;ent to us the models which approach the neare&s;t to perfection.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN comparing Demo&s;thenes and Cicero, mo&s;t of the French Critics incline to give the preference to the latter. P. Rapin the Je&s;uit, in the Parallels which he has drawn between &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Greek and Roman writers, uniformly de|cides in favour of the Roman. For the
<PB N="205" REF="208">
preference which he gives to Cicero, he a&s;|&s;igns, and lays &s;tre&s;s on one rea&s;on of a pretty extraordinary nature; viz. that De|mo&s;thenes could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;o com|plete an in&s;ight as Cicero into the manners and pa&s;&s;ions of men; Why?&mdash;Becau&s;e he had not the advantage of peru&s;ing Ari&s;to|tle's treati&s;e of Rhetoric, wherein, &s;ays our Critic, he has fully laid open that my&s;tery: and, to &s;upport this weighty argument he enters into a controver&s;y with A. Gellius, in order to prove that Ari&s;totle's Rhetoric was not publi&s;hed till after Demo&s;thenes had &s;poken, at lea&s;t, his mo&s;t con&s;iderable orations. Nothing can be more childi&s;h. Such Orators as Cicero and Demo&s;thenes, derived their knowledge of the human pa&s;|&s;ions, and their power of moving them, from higher &s;ources than any Treati&s;e of Rhetoric. One French Critic has indeed departed from the common tract; and, af|ter be&s;towing on Cicero tho&s;e ju&s;t prai&s;es to which the con&s;ent of &s;o many ages &s;hows him to be entitled, concludes howe|ver, with giving the palm to Demo&s;thenes. This is Fenelon, the famous Archbi&s;hop of Cambray, and Author of Telemachus; him&s;elf &s;urely no enemy to all the graces and flowers of compo&s;ition. It is in his Reflections on Rhetoric and Poetry, that he gives this judgment; a &s;mall tract, com|monly publi&s;hed along with his dialogues

<P>THE reign of Eloquence, among the Romans, was very &s;hort. After the age of Cicero, it langui&s;hed, or rather expired; and we have no rea&s;on to wonder at this be|ing the ca&s;e.

of &s;ome of the mo&s;t execrable tyrants that ever di&s;graced, and &s;courged, the hu|man race. Under their government, it was naturally to be expected that ta&s;te would be corrupted, and genius di&s;couraged. Some of the ornamental arts, le&s;s intimately connected with liberty, continued, for a while, to prevail; but for that ma&s;culine Eloquence, which had exerci&s;ed it&s;elf in the &s;enate, and in the public affairs, there was no longer any place. The change which was produced on Eloquence, by the nature of the government, and the &s;tate of the public manners, is beautifully de&s;cribed in the Dialogue de Cau&s;is corruptae Eloquen|tiae, which is attributed, by &s;ome, to Taci|tus, by others, to Quinctilian. Luxury, effeminacy, and flattery, overwhelmed all. The Forum, where &s;o many great affairs had been tran&s;acted, was now become a de&s;ert.

IN the decline of the Roman Empire, the introduction of Chri&s;tianity gave ri&s;e to a new &s;pecies of Eloquence, in the apolo|gies, &s;ermons, and pa&s;toral writings of the Fathers of the Church. Among the Latin Fathers, Lactantius and Minutius Felix, are the mo&s;t remarkable for purity of Style; and, in a later age, the famous St. Augu&s;|tine po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;prightline&s;s and &s;trength. But none of the Fathers afford any ju&s;t models of Elo|quence. Their Language, as &s;oon as we de&s;cend to the third or fourth century, be|comes har&s;h; and they are, in general, in|fected with the ta&s;te of that age, a love of &s;woln and &s;trained thoughts, and of the play of words. Among the Greek Fathers, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, by far, for his ora|torial merit, is St. Chry&s;o&s;tome. His Lan|guage is pure; his Style highly figured. He is copious, &s;mooth, and &s;ometimes pa|thetic. But he retains, at the &s;ame time, much of that character which has been al|ways attributed to the A&s;iatic Eloquence, diffu&s;e and redundant to a great degree, and often overwrought and tumid. He may be read, however, with advantage, for the Eloquence of the pulpit, as being freer of fal&s;e ornaments than the Latin Fa|thers.</P>
<P>AS there is nothing more that occurs to me, de&s;erving particular attention in the middle age, I pa&s;s now to the &s;tate of Elo|quence in modern times. Here, it mu&s;t
<PB N="211" REF="214">
be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in no European nation, Public Speaking has been con&s;idered as &s;o great an object, or been cultivated with &s;o much care, as in Greece or Rome. Its reputation has never been &s;o high; its effects have never been &s;o con&s;ider|able; nor has that high and &s;ub|lime kind of it, which prevailed in tho&s;e antient &s;tates, been &s;o much as aimed at: notwith&s;tanding, too, that a new profe&s;|&s;ion has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, which gives pe|culiar advantages to Oratory, and affords it the noble&s;t field; I mean, that of the Church. The genius of the world &s;eems, in this re&s;pect, to have undergone &s;ome alteration. The two countries where we might expect to find mo&s;t of the &s;pirit of Eloquence, are France and Great Britain: France, on account of the di&s;tingui&s;hed turn of the nation towards all the liberal arts, and of the encouragement which, for this century pa&s;t, tho&s;e arts have received from the Public; Great Britain, on account both of the public capacity and genius, and of the free government which it enjoys. Yet, &s;o it is, that, in neither of tho&s;e countries, has the talent of Public Speak|ing ri&s;en near to the degree of its antient &s;plendor. While, in other productions of genius, both in pro&s;e and in poetry, they have contended for the prize with Greece and Rome; nay, in &s;ome compo&s;itions, may be thought to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them: the names of Demo&s;thenes and Cicero, &s;tand, at this day, unrivalled in fame; and
<PB N="212" REF="215">
it would be held pre&s;umptuous and ab&s;urd, to pretend to place any modern whatever on the &s;ame, or even on a nearly equal, rank.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems particularly &s;urpri&s;ing, that Great Britain &s;hould not have made a more con&s;picuous figure in Eloquence than it has hitherto attained; when we con&s;ider the enlightened, and, at the &s;ame time, the free and bold genius of the country, which &s;eems not a little to favour Oratory; and when we con&s;ider that, of all the po|lite nations, it alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a popular government, or admits into the legi&s;lature, &s;uch numerous a&s;&s;emblies as can be &s;up|po&s;ed to lie under the dominion of Elo|quence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr, Hume, in his E&s;&s;ay on Eloquence, makes this ob&s;er|vation, and illu&s;trates it with his u&s;ual elegance. He, indeed, &s;uppo&s;es, that no &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons can be given to account for the inferiority of modern to antient Eloquence. In this, I differ from him, and &s;hall endeavour, before the conclu&s;ion of this Lecture, to point out &s;ome cau&s;es to which, I think, it may, in a great mea&s;ure, be a&s;cribed, in the three great &s;cenes of Pub|lic Speaking.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding this advantage, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in mo&s;t parts of Eloquence, we are undoubtedly inferior, not only to the Greeks and Romans by many degrees, but al&s;o to the French. We have Philo&s;ophers, eminent and con&s;picu|ous, perhaps, beyond any nation, in all the parts of &s;cience. We have both ta&s;te and erudition, in a high degree. We have
<PB N="213" REF="216">
Hi&s;torians, we have Poets of the greate&s;t name; but of Orators, or Public Speakers, how little have we to boa&s;t? And where are the monuments of their genius to be found? in every period we have had &s;ome who made a figure, by managing the de|bates in Parliament; but that figure was commonly owing to their wi&s;dom, or their experience in bu&s;ine&s;s, more than to their talents for Oratory; and unle&s;s, in &s;ome few in&s;tances, wherein the power of Ora|tory has appeared, indeed, with much lu&s;tre, the art of Parliamentary Speaking rather obtained to &s;everal a temporary ap|plau&s;e, than conferred upon any a la&s;ting renown. At the bar, though, que&s;tionle&s;s, we have many able pleaders, yet few or none of their pleadings have been thought worthy to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity; nor have commanded attention, any longer than the cau&s;e which was the &s;ubject of them intere&s;ted the Public; while, in France, the pleadings of Patru, in the former age, and tho&s;e of Cochin and D'Ague&s;&s;eau, in later times, are read with plea&s;ure, and are often quoted as examples of Eloquence by the French critics. In the &s;ame man|ner, in the pulpit, the Briti&s;h divines have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the mo&s;t accu|rate and rational compo&s;itions which, per|haps, any nation can boa&s;t of. Many printed &s;ermons we have, full of good &s;en&s;e, and of &s;ound divinity and morality; but the Eloquence to be found in them,
<PB N="214" REF="217">
the power of per&s;ua&s;ion, of intere&s;ting and engaging the heart, which is, or ought to be, the great object of the pulpit, is far from bearing a &s;uitable proportion to the excellence of the matter. There are few arts, in my opinion, farther from perfec|tion, than that of preaching is among us; the rea&s;ons of which, I &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to di&s;cu&s;s; in proof of the fact, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that an Engli&s;h &s;ermon, in&s;tead of being a per&s;ua|&s;ive animated Oration, &s;eldom ri&s;es beyond the &s;train of correct and dry rea&s;oning. Whereas, in the &s;ermons of Bo&s;&s;uet, Ma&s;|&s;illon, Bourdaloue, and Flechier, among the French, we &s;ee a much higher &s;pecies of Eloquence aimed at, and in a great mea|&s;ure attained, than the Briti&s;h preachers have in view.</P>
<P>IN general, the characteri&s;tical difference between the &s;tate of Eloquence in France and in Great Britain is, that the French have adopted higher ideas both of plea&s;ing and per&s;uading by means of Oratory, though, &s;ometimes, in the execution they fail. In Great Britain, we have taken up Eloquence on a lower key; but in our ex|ecution, as was naturally to be expected, have been more correct. In France, the &s;tyle of their Orators is ornamented with bolder figures; and their di&s;cour&s;e carried on with more amplification, more warmth and elevation. The compo&s;ition is often
<PB N="215" REF="218">
very beautiful; but &s;ometimes, al&s;o, too diffu&s;e, and deficient in that &s;trength and cogency which renders Eloquence power|ful; a defect owing, perhaps, in part, to the genius of the people, which leads them to attend fully as much to ornament as to &s;ub&s;tance; and, in part, to the nature of their government, which, by excluding Public Speaking from having much influ|ence on the conduct of Public Affairs, de|prives Eloquence of its be&s;t opportunity for acquiring nerves and &s;trength. Hence the pulpit is the principal field which is left for their Eloquence. The members, too, of the French academy give harangues at their admi&s;&s;ion, in which genius often appears; but labouring under the misfor|tune of having no &s;ubject to di&s;cour&s;e up|on, they run commonly into flattery and panegyric, the mo&s;t barren and in&s;ipid of all topics.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED before, that the Greeks and Romans a&s;pired to a more &s;ublime &s;pe|cies of Eloquence, than is aimed at by the Moderns. Theirs was of the vehement and pa&s;&s;ionate kind, by which they endea|voured to inflame the minds of their hear|ers, and hurry their imaginations away: and, &s;uitable to this vehemence of thought, was their vehemence of ge&s;ture and action; the <Q REND="inline">"&s;upplo&s;io pedis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide, De Clar. Orator.</NOTE>,"</Q> the <Q REND="inline">"percu&s;&s;io frontis &amp; femoris,"</Q> were, as we learn
<PB N="216" REF="219">
from Cicero's writings, u&s;ual ge&s;tures a|mong them at the bar; though now they would be reckoned extravagant any where, except upon the &s;tage. Modern Eloquence is much more cool and temperate; and in Great Britain e&s;pecially, has confined it&s;elf almo&s;t wholly to the argumentative and rational. It is much of that &s;pecies which the antient critics called the <Q REND="inline">"Tenuis,"</Q> or <Q REND="inline">"Subtilis;"</Q> which aims at convincing and in&s;tructing, rather than affecting the pa&s;&s;i|ons, and a&s;&s;umes a tone not much higher than common argument and di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>SEVERAL rea&s;ons may be given, why modern Eloquence has been &s;o limited, and humble in its efforts. In the fir&s;t place, I am of opinion, that this change mu&s;t, in part, be a&s;cribed to that correct turn of thinking, which has been &s;o much &s;tudied in modern times. It can hardly be doubt|ed, that, in many efforts of mere genius, the antient Greeks and Romans excelled us; but, on the other hand, that, in accuracy and clo&s;ene&s;s of rea&s;oning on many &s;ub|jects, we have &s;ome advantage over them, ought, I think, to be admitted al&s;o: In proportion as the world has advanced, phi|lo&s;ophy has made greater progre&s;s. A cer|tain &s;trictne&s;s of good &s;en&s;e has, in this i&s;land particularly, been cultivated, and introduced into every &s;ubject. Hence we are more on our guard again&s;t the flowers of Elocution; we are on the watch; we are
<PB N="217" REF="220">
jealous of being deceived by Oratory. Our Public Speakers are obliged to be more re|&s;erved than the antients, in their attempts to elevate the imagination, and warm the pa&s;&s;ions; and, by the influence of prevail|ing ta&s;te, their own genius is &s;obered and cha&s;tened, perhaps, in too great a degree. It is likely too, I confe&s;s, that what we fondly a&s;cribe to our correctne&s;s and good &s;en&s;e, is owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to our phlegm and natural coldne&s;s. For the vi|vacity and &s;en&s;ibility of the Greeks and Ro|mans, more e&s;pecially of the former, &s;eem to have been much greater than ours, and to have given them a higher reli&s;h of all the beauties of Oratory.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e national con&s;iderations, we mu&s;t, in the next place, attend to pe|culiar circum&s;tances in the three great &s;cenes of Public Speaking, which have proved di&s;advantageous to the growth of Eloquence among us. Though the Parlia|ment of Great Britain be the noble&s;t field which Europe, at this day, affords to a Public Speaker, yet Eloquence has never been &s;o powerful an in&s;trument there, as it was in the popular a&s;&s;emblies of Greece and Rome. Under &s;ome former reigns, the high hand of arbitrary power bore a vio|lent &s;way; and in later times, mini&s;terial influence has generally prevailed. The power of Speaking, though always con&s;i|derable, yet has been often found too feeble
<PB N="218" REF="221">
to counterbalance either of the&s;e; and, of cour&s;e, has not been &s;tudied with &s;o much zeal and fervour, as where its effect on bu|&s;ine&s;s was irre&s;i&s;tible and certain.</P>
<P>AT the Bar, our di&s;advantage, in com|pari&s;on of the antients, is great. Among them, the judges were generally numerous; the laws were few and &s;imple; the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es was left, in a great mea&s;ure, to equity and the &s;en&s;e of mankind. Here was an ample field for what they termed Judicial Eloquence. But among the mo|derns, the ca&s;e is quite altered. The &s;y&s;|tem of law is become much more compli|cated. The knowledge of it is thereby rendered &s;o laborious an attainment, as to be the chief object of a lawyer's education, and, in a manner, the &s;tudy of his life. The Art of Speaking is but a &s;econdary accompli&s;hment, to which he can afford to devote much le&s;s of his time and labour. The bounds of Eloquence be&s;ides, are now much circum&s;cribed at the Bar; and except, in a few ca&s;es, reduced to arguing from &s;trict law, &s;tatute, or precedent; by which means knowledge, much more than Ora|tory, is become the principal requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the Pulpit, it has cer|tainly been a great di&s;advantage, that the practice of reading Sermons, in &s;tead of re|peating them from memory, has prevailed &s;o univer&s;ally in England. This may, in|deed,
<PB N="219" REF="222">
have introduced accuracy; but it has done great prejudice to Eloquence; for a Di&s;cour&s;e read, is far inferior to an Oration &s;poken. It leads to a different &s;ort of com|po&s;ition, as well as of delivery; and can never have an equal effect upon any audi|ence. Another circum&s;tance, too, has been unfortunate. The &s;ectaries and fanatics, before the Re&s;toration, adopted a warm, zealous, and popular manner of preaching; and tho&s;e who adhered to them, in after|times, continued to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;omewhat of the &s;ame manner. The odium of the&s;e &s;ects drove the e&s;tabli&s;hed church from that warmth which they were judged to have carried too far, into the op|po&s;ite extreme of a &s;tudied coolne&s;s, and compo&s;ure of manner. Hence, from the art of per&s;ua&s;ion, which preaching ought always to be, it has pa&s;&s;ed, in England, into mere rea&s;oning and in&s;truction; which not only has brought down the Eloquence of the Pulpit to a lower tone than it might ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ume; but has produced this far|ther effect, that, by accu&s;toming the Pub|lic ear to &s;uch cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Di&s;|cour&s;es, it has tended to fa&s;hion other kinds of Public Speaking upon the &s;ame model.</P>
<P>THUS I have given &s;ome view of the &s;tate of Eloquence in modern times, and endeavoured to account for it. It has, as we have &s;een, fallen below that &s;plendor which it maintained in antient ages;
<PB N="220" REF="223">
and from being &s;ublime and vehement, has come down to be temperate and cool. Yet, &s;till in that region which it occu|pies, it admits great &s;cope; and, to the defect of zeal and application, more than to the want of capacity and ge|nius, we may a&s;cribe its not having hither|to ri&s;en higher. It is a field where there is much honour yet to be reaped; it is an in&s;trument which may be employed for purpo&s;es of the highe&s;t importance. The antient models may &s;till, with much advan|tage, be &s;et before us for imitation; though, in that imitation, we mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, have &s;ome regard to what modern ta&s;te and mo|dern manners will bear; of which I &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to &s;ay more.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXVII. DIFFERENT KINDS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING&mdash;ELOQUENCE OF PO|PULAR ASSEMBLIES&mdash;EXTRACTS FROM DEMOSTHENES.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the preliminary views which have been given of the nature of Eloquence in general, and of the &s;tate in which it has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in different ages and countries, I am now to enter on con&s;idering the different kinds of Public Speaking, the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of each, and the rules which relate to them. The ancients divided all Orations into three kinds; the Demon&s;trative, the Deliberative, and the Ju|dicial. The &s;cope of the Demon&s;trative was to prai&s;e or to blame; that of the Delibe|rative to advi&s;e or to di&s;&s;uade; that of the Judicial, to accu&s;e or to defend. The chief &s;ubjects of Demon&s;trative Eloquence, were Panegyrics, Invectives, Gratulatory. and Funeral Orations. The Deliberative was
<PB N="222" REF="225">
employed in matters of public concern, agitated in the Senate, or before the A&s;&s;em|blies of the People. The Judicial is the &s;ame with the Eloquence of the Bar, em|ployed in addre&s;&s;ing Judges, who have power to ab&s;olve or condemn. This divi&s;i|on runs through all the ancient Treati&s;es on Rhetoric; and is followed by the moderns, who copy them. It is a divi&s;ion not inarti|ficial; and comprehends mo&s;t, or all of the matters which can be the &s;ubject of Public Di&s;cour&s;e. It will, however, &s;uit our pur|po&s;e better, and be found, I imagine, more u&s;eful, to follow that divi&s;ion which the train of Modern Speaking naturally points out to us, taken from the three great &s;cenes of Eloquence, Popular A&s;&s;emblies, the Bar, and the Pulpit; each of which has a di&s;|tinct character that particularly &s;uits it. This divi&s;ion coincides in part with the an|cient one. The Eloquence of the Bar is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with what the ancients called the Judicial. The Eloquence of Po|pular A&s;&s;emblies, though mo&s;tly of what they term the Deliberative Species, yet ad|mits al&s;o of the Demon&s;trative. The Elo|quence of the Pulpit is altogether of a di&s;|tinct nature, and cannot be properly re|duced under any of the heads of the anci|ent Rhetoricians.</P>
<P>To all the three, Pulpit, Bar, and Popu|lar A&s;&s;emblies, belong, in common, the rules concerning the conduct of a di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="223" REF="226">
in all its parts. Of tho&s;e rules I purpo&s;e afterwards to treat at large. But before proceeding to them, I intend to &s;how, fir&s;t, what is peculiar to each of the&s;e three kinds of Oratory, in their &s;pirit, character, or manner. For every &s;pecies of Public Speak|ing has a manner or character peculiarly &s;uited to it; of which it is highly material to have a ju&s;t idea, in order to direct the ap|plication of general rules. The Eloquence of a Lawyer is fundamentally different from that of a Divine, or a Speaker in Par|liament: and to have a preci&s;e and proper idea of the di&s;tingui&s;hing character which any kind of Public Speaking requires, is the foundation of what is called a ju&s;t ta&s;te in that kind of Speaking.</P>
<P>LAYING a&s;ide any que&s;tion concerning the pre-eminence in point of rank, which is due to any one of the three kinds before mentioned, I &s;hall begin with that which tends to throw mo&s;t light upon the re&s;t, viz. the Eloquence of Popular A&s;&s;emblies. The mo&s;t augu&s;t Theatre for this kind of Elo|quence, to be found in any nation of Eu|rope, is, beyond doubt, the Parliament of Great Britain. In meetings too, of le&s;s dig|nity, it may di&s;play it&s;elf. Wherever there is a popular court, or wherever any num|ber of men are a&s;&s;embled for debate or con|&s;ulation, there, in different forms, this &s;pecies of Eloquence may take place.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="227">
ITS object is, or ought always to be, Per&s;ua&s;ion. There mu&s;t be &s;ome end pro|po&s;ed; &s;ome point, mo&s;t commonly of pub|lic utility or good, in favour of which we &s;eek to determine the hearers. Now, in all attempts to per&s;uade men, we mu&s;t pro|ceed upon this principle, that it is nece&s;&s;a|ry to convince their under&s;tanding. No|thing can be more erroneous, than to ima|gine, that, becau&s;e Speeches to Popular A&s;&s;emblies admit more of a declamatory Style than &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;es, they there|fore &s;tand le&s;s in need of being &s;upported by &s;ound rea&s;oning. When modelled upon this fal&s;e idea, they may have the &s;how, but never can produce the effect, of real Elo|quence. Even the &s;how of Eloquence which they make, will plea&s;e only the tri|fling and &s;uperficial. For, with all tolera|ble judges, indeed almo&s;t with all men, mere declamation &s;oon becomes in&s;ipid. Of whatever rank the hearers be, a Speaker is never to pre&s;ume, that by a frothy and o&s;|tentatious harangue, without &s;olid &s;en&s;e and argument, he can either make impre&s;|&s;ion on them, or acquire fame to him&s;elf. It is, at lea&s;t, a dangerous experiment; for, where &s;uch an artifice &s;ucceeds once, it will fail ten times. Even the common people are better judges of argument and good &s;en&s;e, than we &s;ometimes think them; and upon any que&s;tion of bu&s;ine&s;s, a plain man, who &s;peaks to the point without art,
<PB N="225" REF="228">
will generally prevail over the mo&s;t artful Speaker who deals in flowers and orna|ment, rather than in rea&s;oning. Much more, when Public Speakers addre&s;s them|&s;elves to any A&s;&s;embly where there are per&s;ons of education and improved under|&s;tanding, they ought to be careful not to trifle with their hearers.</P>
<P>LET it be ever kept in view, that the foundation of all that can be called Elo|quence, is good &s;en&s;e, and &s;olid thought. As popular as the Orations of Demo&s;thenes were, &s;poken to all the citizens of Athens, every one who looks into them, mu&s;t &s;ee how fraught they are with argument; and how important it appeared to him, to con|vince the under&s;tanding, in order to per|&s;uade, or to work on the principles of ac|tion. Hence their influence in his own time; hence their fame at this day. Such a pattern as this, Public Speakers ought to &s;et before them for imitation, rather than follow the tract of tho&s;e loo&s;e and frothy Declaimers, who have brought di&s;credit on Eloquence. Let it be their fir&s;t &s;tudy, in addre&s;&s;ing any Popular A&s;&s;embly, to be pre|viou&s;ly ma&s;ters of the bu&s;ine&s;s on which they are to &s;peak; to be well provided with matter and argument; and to re&s;t upon the&s;e the chief &s;tre&s;s. This will always give to their di&s;cour&s;e an air of manline&s;s and &s;trength, which is a powerful in&s;tru|ment of per&s;ua&s;ion. Ornament, if they
<PB N="226" REF="229">
have genius for it, will follow of cour&s;e; at any rate it demands only their &s;econdary &s;tudy: <Q REND="inline">"Cura &s;it verborum; &s;olicitudo re|rum."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"To your expre&s;&s;ion be atten|tive, but about your matter be &s;olicitous,"</Q> is an advice of Quinctilian, which cannot be too often recollected by all who &s;tudy Oratory.</P>
<P>IN the next place, in order to be per&s;ua|&s;ive Speakers in a Popular A&s;&s;embly, it is, in my opinion, a capital rule, that we be our&s;elves per&s;uaded of whatever we re|commend to others. Never, when it can be avoided, ought we to e&s;pou&s;e any &s;ide of the argument, but what we believe to be the true and the right one. Seldom or ne|ver will a man be eloquent, but when he is in earne&s;t, and uttering his own &s;enti|ments. They are only the <Q REND="inline">"verae voces ab imo pectore,"</Q> the una&s;&s;umed language of the heart or head, that carry the force of conviction. In a former Lecture, when entering on this &s;ubject, I ob&s;erved, that all high Eloquence mu&s;t be the offspring of pa&s;&s;ion, or warm emotion. It is this which makes every man per&s;ua&s;ive; and gives a force to his genius, which it po&s;&s;|e&s;&s;es at no other time. Under what di&s;ad|vantage then is he placed, who, not feel|ing what he utters, mu&s;t counterfeit a warmth to which he is a &s;tranger?</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="230">
I KNOW, that young people, on purpo&s;e to train them&s;elves to the Art of Speaking, imagine it u&s;eful to adopt that &s;ide of the que&s;tion under debate, which, to them|&s;elves, appears the weake&s;t, and to try what figure they can make upon it. But, I am afraid, this is not the mo&s;t improving education for Public Speaking; and that it tends to form them to a habit of flim&s;y and trivial di&s;cour&s;e. Such a liberty they &s;hould, at no time, allow them&s;elves, un|le&s;s in meetings where no real bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on, but where declamation and im|provement in Speech is the &s;ole aim. Nor even in &s;uch meetings, would I recommend it as the mo&s;t u&s;eful exerci&s;e. They will improve them&s;elves to more advantage, and acquit them&s;elves with more honour, by choo&s;ing always that &s;ide of the debate to which, in their own judgment, they are mo&s;t inclined, and &s;upporting it by what &s;eems to them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;olid and per&s;ua|&s;ive. They will acquire the habit of rea|&s;oning clo&s;ely, and expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves with warmth and force, much more when they are adhering to their own &s;entiments, than when they are &s;peaking in contradic|tion to them. In a&s;&s;emblies where any real bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on, whether that bu&s;ine&s;s be of much importance or not, it is always of dangerous con&s;equence for young practitioners to make trial of this &s;ort of play of Speech. It may fix an im|putation on their characters before they
<PB N="228" REF="231">
are aware; and what they intended merely as amu&s;ement, may be turned to the di&s;|credit, either of their principles or their under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>DEBATE, in Popular Courts, &s;eldom al|lows the Speaker that full and accurate preparation before hand, which the Pulpit always, and the Bar &s;ometimes, admits. The arguments mu&s;t be &s;uited to the cour&s;e which the Debate takes; and as no man can exactly fore&s;ee this, one who tru&s;ts to a &s;et Speech, compo&s;ed in his clo&s;et, will, on many occa&s;ions, be thrown out of the ground which he had taken. He will find it pre-occupied by others, or his rea&s;onings &s;uper&s;eded by &s;ome new turn of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and, if he ventures to u&s;e his prepar|ed Speech, it will be frequently at the hazard of making an awkward figure. There is a general prejudice with us, and not wholly an unju&s;t one, again&s;t &s;et Speeches in Public Meetings. The only occa&s;ion, when they have any propriety, is, at the opening of a debate, when the Speaker has it in his power to choo&s;e his field. But as the Debate advances, and parties warm, di&s;cour&s;es of this kind be|come more un&s;uitable. They want the native air; the appearance of being &s;ugge&s;t|ed by the bu&s;ine&s;s that is going on; &s;tudy and o&s;tentation are apt to be vi&s;ible; and, of cour&s;e, though applauded as elegant,
<PB N="229" REF="232">
they are &s;eldom &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive as more free and uncon&s;trained di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS, however, does not by any means conclude again&s;t premeditation of what we are to &s;ay; the neglect of which, and the tru&s;ting wholly to extemporaneous efforts, will unavoidably produce the habit of &s;peaking in a loo&s;e and undige&s;ted man|ner. But the premeditation which is of mo&s;t advantage, in the ca&s;e which we now con&s;ider, is of the &s;ubject or argument in general, rather than of nice compo&s;ition on any particular branch of it. With re|gard to the matter, we cannot be too ac|curate in our preparation, &s;o as to be fully ma&s;ters of the bu&s;ine&s;s under con&s;ideration; but, with regard to words and expre&s;&s;ion, it is very po&s;&s;ible &s;o far to overdo, as to render our Speech &s;tiff and preci&s;e. In|deed, till once per&s;ons acquire that firm|ne&s;s, that pre&s;ence of mind, and command of expre&s;&s;ion, in a Public Meeting, which nothing but habit and practice can be&s;tow, it may be proper for a young Speaker to commit to memory the whole of what he is to &s;ay. But, after &s;ome performances of this kind have given him boldne&s;s, he will find it the better method not to confine him&s;elf &s;o &s;trictly; but only to write, be|forehand, &s;ome Sentences with which he intends to &s;et out, in order to put him&s;elf fairly in the train; and, for the re&s;t, to &s;et down &s;hort notes of the topics, or principal
<PB N="230" REF="233">
thoughts upon which he is to in&s;i&s;t, in their order, leaving the words to be &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the warmth of di&s;cour&s;e. Such &s;hort notes of the &s;ub&s;tance of the di&s;|cour&s;e, will be found of con&s;iderable &s;er|vice, to tho&s;e, e&s;pecially, who are begin|ning to &s;peak in public. They will ac|cu&s;tom them to &s;ome degree of accuracy, which, if they &s;peak frequently, they are in danger too &s;oon of lo&s;ing. They will even accu&s;tom them to think more clo&s;ely on the &s;ubject in que&s;tion; and will a&s;&s;i&s;t them greatly in arranging their thoughts with method and order.</P>
<P>THIS leads me next to ob&s;erve, that in all kinds of Public Speaking, nothing is of greater con&s;equence than a proper and clear method. I mean not that formal me|thod of laying down heads and &s;ubdivi|&s;ions, which is commonly practi&s;ed in the Pulpit; and which, in Popular A&s;&s;emblies, unle&s;s the Speaker be a man of great au|thority and character, and the &s;ubject of great importance, and the preparation too very accurate, is rather in hazard of di&s;gu&s;t|ing the hearers: &s;uch an introduction pre|&s;enting always the melancholy pro&s;pect of along di&s;cour&s;e. But though the method be not laid down in form, no di&s;cour&s;e, of any length, &s;hould be without method; that is, every thing &s;hould be found in its proper place. Every one who &s;peaks, will find it of the greate&s;t advantage to him&s;elf
<PB N="231" REF="234">
to have previou&s;ly arranged his thoughts, and cla&s;&s;ed under proper heads, in his own mind, what he is to deliver. This will a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory, and carry him through his di&s;cour&s;e, without that confu&s;ion to which one is every moment &s;ubject, who has fixed no di&s;tinct plan of what he is to &s;ay. And with re&s;pect to the hearers, or|der in di&s;cour&s;e is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for making any proper impre&s;&s;ion. It adds both force and light to what is &s;aid. It makes them accompany the Speaker ea&s;ily and readily, as he goes along; and makes them feel the full effect of every argument which he employs. Few things, therefore, de&s;erve more to be attended to than di&s;tinct arrangement: for Eloquence, however great, can never produce entire conviction without it. Of the rules of method, and the proper di&s;tribution of the &s;everal parts of a di&s;cour&s;e, I am hereafter to treat.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider of the Style and Expre&s;&s;ion &s;uited to the Eloquence of Popu|lar A&s;&s;emblies. Beyond doubt, the&s;e give &s;cope for the mo&s;t animated manner of Public Speaking. The very a&s;pect of a large A&s;&s;embly, engaged in &s;ome debate of moment, and attentive to the di&s;cour&s;e of one man, is &s;ufficient to in&s;pire that man with &s;uch elevation and warmth, as both give ri&s;e to &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, and gives them propriety. Pa&s;&s;ion ea&s;ily ri&s;es in a great A&s;&s;embly, where the movements
<PB N="232" REF="235">
are communicated by mutual &s;ympathy between the Orator and the Audience. Tho&s;e bold figures, of which I treated for|merly as the native Language of pa&s;&s;ion, then have their proper place. That ar|dour of Speech, that vehemence and glow of Sentiment, which ari&s;e from a mind animated and in&s;pired by &s;ome great and public object, form the peculiar character|i&s;tics of Popular Eloquence, in its highe&s;t degree of perfection.</P>
<P>THE liberty, however, which we are now giving of the &s;trong and pa&s;&s;ionate manner to this kind of Oratory, mu&s;t be always under&s;tood with certain limitations and re&s;traints, which, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to point out di&s;tinctly, in order to guard again&s;t dangerous mi&s;takes on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, The warmth which we expre&s;s mu&s;t be &s;uited to the occa&s;ion and the &s;ub|ject: for nothing can be more prepo&s;terous, than an attempt to introduce great vehe|mence into a &s;ubject, which is either of &s;light importance, or which, by its nature, requires to be treated of calmly. A temperate tone of Speech, is that for which there is mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ion; and he who is, on eve|ry &s;ubject, pa&s;&s;ionate and vehement, will be con&s;idered as a blu&s;terer, and meet with little regard.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="236">
IN the &s;econd place, We mu&s;t take care never to counterfeit warmth without feel|ing it. This always betrays per&s;ons into an unnatural manner, which expo&s;es them to ridicule. For, as I have often &s;ugge&s;ted, to &s;upport the appearance, without the real feeling of pa&s;&s;ion, is one of the mo&s;t difficult things in nature. The di&s;gui&s;e can almo&s;t never be &s;o perfect, but it is di&s;covered. The heart can only an&s;wer to the heart. The great rule here, as indeed in every other ca&s;e, is, to follow nature; never to attempt a &s;train of Eloquence which is not &s;econded by our own genius. One may be a Speaker, both of much reputation and much influence, in the calm argumentative manner. To attain the pathetic, and the &s;ublime of Oratory, requires tho&s;e &s;trong &s;en&s;ibilities of mind, and that high power of expre&s;&s;ion, which are given to few.</P>
<P>IN the third place, Even when the &s;ub|ject ju&s;tifies the vehement manner, and when genius prompts it; when warmth is felt, not counterfeited; we mu&s;t, how|ever, &s;et a guard on our&s;elves, not to al|low impetuo&s;ity to tran&s;port us too far. Without emotion in the &s;peaker, Elo|quence, as was before ob&s;erved, will ne|ver produce its highe&s;t effects; but, at the &s;ame time, if the Speaker lo&s;e command of him&s;elf, he will &s;oon lo&s;e command of his audience too. He mu&s;t never kindle too &s;oon: he mu&s;t begin with moderation;
<PB N="234" REF="237">
and &s;tudy to carry his hearers along with him, as he warms in the progre&s;s of his di&s;cour&s;e. For, if he runs before in the cour&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, and leaves them behind; if they are not tuned, if we may &s;peak &s;o, uni&s;on to him, the di&s;cord will pre&s;ently be felt, and be very grating. Let a Speak|er have never &s;o good rea&s;on to be animat|ed and fired by his &s;ubject, it is always ex|pected of him, that the awe and regard due to his Audience &s;hould lay a decent re&s;traint upon his warmth, and prevent it from carrying him beyond certain bounds. If, when mo&s;t heated by the &s;ubject, he can be &s;o far ma&s;ter of him&s;elf as to pre|&s;erve clo&s;e attention to argument, and even to &s;ome degree of correct expre&s;&s;ion, this &s;elf-command, this exertion of rea&s;on, in the mid&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, has a wonderful effect both to plea&s;e, and to per&s;uade. It is in|deed the ma&s;ter-piece, the highe&s;t attain|ment of Eloquence; uniting the &s;trength of rea&s;on, with the vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion; affording all the advantages of pa&s;&s;ion for the purpo&s;e of per&s;ua&s;ion, without the confu&s;ion and di&s;order which are apt to accompany it.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t animated &s;train of popular &s;peaking, we mu&s;t always pre&s;erve regard to what the public ear will bear. This direction I give, in order to guard again&s;t an inju|dicious imitation of ancient Orators, who,
<PB N="235" REF="238">
both in their pronunciation and ge&s;ture, and in their figures of expre&s;&s;ion, u&s;ed a bolder manner than what the greater cool|ne&s;s of modern ta&s;te will readily &s;uffer. This may perhaps, as I formerly ob&s;erved, be a di&s;advantage to Modern Eloquence. It is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould be too &s;evere in checking the impul&s;e of genius, and conti|nue always creeping on the ground; but it is a rea&s;on, however, why we &s;hould avoid carrying the tone of declamation to a height that would now be reckoned extravagant. Demo&s;thenes, to ju&s;tify the un&s;ucce&s;sful action of Cheronaea, calls up the manes of tho&s;e heroes who fell in the battle of Mara|thon and Plataea, and &s;wears by them, that their fellow citizens had done well, in their endeavours to &s;upport the &s;ame cau&s;e. Ci|cero, in his oration for Milo, implores and atte&s;ts the Alban hills and groves, and makes a long addre&s;s to them: and both pa&s;&s;ages, in the&s;e Orators, have a fine effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;age in Cicero is very beautiful, and adorned with the highe&s;t colouring of his Eloquence. <Q REND="inline">"Non e&s;t hu|mano con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ilio, ne mediocri quidem, Judices, deorum im|mortalium cura, res illa perfecta.

But
<PB N="236" REF="239">
how few modern Orators could venture on &s;uch apo&s;trophes? and what a power of ge|nius would it require to give &s;uch figures now their proper grace, or make them pro|duce a due effect upon the hearers?</P>
<P>IN the fifth and la&s;t place, in all kinds of Public Speaking, but e&s;pecially in Popular A&s;&s;emblies, it is a capital rule to attend to all the decorums of time, place, and charac|ter. No warmth of Eloquence can atone for the neglect of the&s;e. That vehemence, which is becoming in a per&s;on of character and authority, may be un&s;uitable to the mode&s;ty expected from a young Speaker. That &s;portive and witty manner which may &s;uit one &s;ubject and on eA&s;&s;embly, is alto|gether out of place in a grave cau&s;e, and a &s;olemn meeting. <Q REND="inline">"Caput artis e&s;t,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"decere."</Q>   <Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t prin|ciple of art, is, to ob&s;erve decorum."</Q> No one &s;hould ever ri&s;e to &s;peak in pub|lic, without forming to him&s;elf a ju&s;t and &s;trict idea of what &s;uits his own age and character; what &s;uits the &s;ubject, the hear|ers the place, the occa&s;ion; and adju&s;ting the whole train and manner of his &s;peak|ing on this idea. All the ancients in&s;i&s;t much on this. Con&s;ult the fir&s;t chapter of the eleventh book of Quinctilian, which is employed wholly on this point, and is full
<PB N="237" REF="240">
of good &s;en&s;e. Cicero's admonitions in his Orator ad Brutum, I &s;hall give in his own words, which &s;hould never be forgotten by any who &s;peak in public. <Q REND="inline">"E&s;t Eloquen|tiae, &s;icut reliquarum rerum, fundamen|tum, &s;apientia; ut enim in vita, &s;ic in oratione nihil e&s;t difficilius quam quod deceat videre; hujus ignoratione &s;aepi&s;&s;i|m&egrave; peccatur; non enim omnis fortuna, non omnis auctoritas, non omnis aetas, nec vero locus, aut tempus, aut auditor omnis, eodem aut verborum genere trac|tandus e&s;t, aut &s;ententiarum.

For to the different degrees of rank, fortune, and age among men, to all the varieties of time, place, and auditory, the &s;ame Style of Language, and the &s;ame &s;train of thought, cannot agree. In every part of a di&s;cour&s;e, ju&s;t as in every part of life, we mu&s;t attend to what is &s;uita|ble and decent; whether that be determined by the na|ture of the &s;ubject of which we treat, or by the characters of tho&s;e who &s;peak, or of tho&s;e who hear."</Q></NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;So much for the con&s;iderati|ons that require to be attended to, with re|&s;pect to the vehemence and warmth which is allowed in Popular Eloquence.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="241">
THE current of Style &s;hould in general be full, free, and natural. Quaint and ar|tificial expre&s;&s;ions are out of place here; and always derogate from per&s;ua&s;ion. It is a &s;trong and manly Style which &s;hould chief|ly be &s;tudied; and metaphorical Language, when properly introduced, produces often a happy effect. When the metaphors are warm, glowing, and de&s;criptive, &s;ome in|accuracy in them will be overlooked, which, in a written compo&s;ition, would be remarked and cen&s;ured. Amid&s;t the torrent of de|clamation, the &s;trength of the figure makes impre&s;&s;ion; the inaccuracy of it e&s;capes.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the degree of conci&s;ene&s;s or diffu&s;ene&s;s, &s;uited to Popular Eloquence, it is not ea&s;y to fix any exact bounds. I know that it is common to recommend a diffu&s;e manner as the mo&s;t proper. I am inclined, however, to think, that there is danger of erring in this re&s;pect; and that by indulging too much in the diffu&s;e Style, public Speakers often lo&s;e more in point of &s;trength, than they gain by the fulne&s;s of their illu&s;tration. There is no doubt, that in &s;peaking to a multitude, we mu&s;t not &s;peak in &s;entences and apothegms; care mu&s;t be taken to explain and to inculcate; but this care may be, and frequently is, car|ried too far. We ought always to remem|ber, that how much &s;oever we may be plea&s;ed with hearing our&s;elves &s;peak, eve|ry Audience is very ready to tire; and the
<PB N="239" REF="242">
moment they begin to tire, all our Elo|quence goes for nothing. A loo&s;e and ver|bo&s;e manner never fails to create di&s;gu&s;t; and, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, we had better run the ri&s;que of &s;aying too little, than too much. Better place our thought in one &s;trong point of view, and re&s;t it there, than by turning it into every light, and pouring forth a profu&s;ion of words upon it, exhau&s;t the attention of our hearers, and leave them flat and languid.</P>
<P>OF Pronounciation and Delivery, I am hereafter to treat apart. It is &s;ufficient now to ob&s;erve, that in &s;peaking to mixt A&s;&s;emblies, the be&s;t manner of delive|ry is the firm and the determined. An ar|rogant and overbearing manner is indeed always di&s;agreeable; and the lea&s;t appear|ance of it ought to be &s;hunned: but there is a certain deci&s;ive tone, which may be a&s;|&s;umed even by a mode&s;t man, who is tho|roughly per&s;uaded of the &s;entiments he ut|ters; and which is the be&s;t calculated for making a general impre&s;&s;ion. A feeble and he&s;itating manner be&s;peaks always &s;ome di&s;tru&s;t of a man's own opinion; which is, by no means, a favourable circum&s;tance for his inducing others to embrace it.</P>
<P>THESE are the chief thoughts which have occurred to me from reflection and ob|&s;ervation, concerning the peculiar di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Characters of the Eloquence pro|per
<PB N="240" REF="243">
for Popular A&s;&s;emblies. The &s;um of what has been &s;aid, is this: The end of Po|pular Speaking is per&s;ua&s;ion; and this mu&s;t be founded on conviction. Argument and rea&s;oning mu&s;t be the ba&s;is, if we would be Speakers of bu&s;ine&s;s, and not mere Declaim|ers. We &s;hould be engaged in earne&s;t on the &s;ide which we e&s;pou&s;e; and utter, as much as po&s;&s;ible, our own, and not counter|feited Sentiments. The premeditation &s;hould be of things, rather than of words. Clear order and method &s;hould be &s;tudied: The manner and expre&s;&s;ion warm and ani|mated; though &s;till, in the mid&s;t of that vehemence, which may at times be &s;uita|ble, carried on under the proper re&s;traints which regard to the audience, and to the decorum of character, ought to lay on every Public Speaker: the Style free and ea&s;y; &s;trong and de&s;criptive, rather than diffu&s;e; and the delivery determined and firm. To conclude this head, let every Orator re|member, that the impre&s;&s;ion made by fine and artful &s;peaking is momentary; that made by argument and good &s;en&s;e, is &s;olid and la&s;ting.</P>
<P>I SHALL now, that I may afford an ex|emplification of that &s;pecies of Oratory of which I have been treating, in&s;ert &s;ome extracts from Demo&s;thenes. Even under the great di&s;advantage of an Engli&s;h tran|&s;lation, they will exhibit a &s;mall &s;pecimen
<PB N="241" REF="244">
of that vigorous and &s;pirited eloquence which I have &s;o often prai&s;ed. I &s;hall take my extracts mo&s;tly from the Philippics and Olynthiacs, which were entirely popular Orations &s;poken to the general convention of the citizens of Athens: and, as the &s;ub|ject of both the Philippics, and the Olyn|thiacs, is the &s;ame, I &s;hall not confine my|&s;elf to one Oration, but &s;hall join together pa&s;&s;ages taken from two or three of them; &s;uch as may &s;how his general &s;train of &s;peaking, on &s;ome of the chief branches of the &s;ubject. The &s;ubject in general is, to rouze the Athenians to guard again&s;t Philip of Macedon, who&s;e growing power and crafty policy had by that time endangered, and &s;oon after overwhelmed the liberties of Greece. The Athenians began to be alarm|ed; but their deliberations were &s;low, and their mea&s;ures feeble; &s;everal of their fa|vourite Orators having been gained by Philip's bribes to favour his cau&s;e. In this critical conjuncture of affairs Demo&s;thenes aro&s;e. In the following manner he begins his fir&s;t Philippic; which, like the exor|diums of all his Orations, is &s;imple and art|le&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the following extracts, Leland's tran&s;lation is mo&s;tly followed.</NOTE>.<Q REND="inline"><P>'HAD we been convened, Athenians! on &s;ome new &s;ubject of debate, I had waited till mo&s;t of your u&s;ual coun&s;ellors had declared their opinions.

approved of what was propo&s;ed by them, I &s;hould have continued &s;ilent; if not, I &s;hould then have attempted to &s;peak my &s;entiments. But &s;ince tho&s;e very points on which the&s;e Speakers have oftentimes been heard already, are at this time to be con&s;idered; though I have ari&s;en fir&s;t, I pre&s;ume I may expect your pardon; for if they on former occa&s;ions had advi&s;ed the proper mea&s;ures, you would not have found it needful to con&s;ult at pre|&s;ent.'</P>
<P>'FIRST then, Athenians! however wretched the &s;ituation of our affairs at pre&s;ent &s;eems, it mu&s;t not by any means be thought de&s;perate. What I am now going to advance may po&s;&s;ibly appear a paradox; yet it is a certain truth, that our pa&s;t misfortunes afford a circum&s;tance the mo&s;t favourable of all others to our future hopes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This thought is only hinted in the fir&s;t Philippic, but brought out more fully in the third; as the &s;ame thoughts, occa&s;ioned by &s;imilar &s;ituations of affairs, &s;ometimes occur in the different orations on this &s;ubject.</NOTE>. And what is that? even that our pre&s;ent difficulties are owing en|tirely to our total indolence, and utter di&s;regard to our own intere&s;t. For were we thus &s;ituated, in &s;pite of every effort which our duty demanded, then indeed we might regard our fortunes as ab&s;o|lutely de&s;perate. But now, Philip hath
<PB N="243" REF="246">
only conquered your &s;upinene&s;s and in|activity; the &s;tate he hath not conquered. You cannot be &s;aid to be defeated; your force hath never been exerted.'</P>
<P>'IF there is a man in this a&s;&s;embly who thinks that we mu&s;t find a formid|able enemy in Philip, while he views on one hand the numerous armies which &s;urround him, and on the other, the weakne&s;s of our &s;tate, de&s;poiled of &s;o much of its dominions, I cannot deny that he thinks ju&s;tly. Yet let him reflect on this; there was a time, Athenians! when we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Pydna, Potidoea, and Melthone, and all that country round; when many of the &s;tates, now &s;ubjected to him, were free and independent, and more inclined to our alliance than to his. If Philip, at that time weak in him&s;elf and without allies, had de&s;ponded of &s;uc|ce&s;s again&s;t you, he would never have engaged in tho&s;e enterpri&s;es which are now crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, nor could have rai&s;ed him&s;elf to that pitch of gran|deur at which you now behold him. But he knew well that the &s;tronge&s;t places are only prizes laid between the combatants, and ready for the conqueror. He knew that the dominions of the ab&s;ent, de|volve naturally to tho&s;e who are in the field; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;upine, to the active and intrepid. Animated by the&s;e &s;entiments he overturns whole na|tions.
<PB N="244" REF="247">
He either rules univer&s;ally as a conqueror, or governs as a protector. For mankind naturally &s;eek confederacy with &s;uch, as they &s;ee re&s;olved and pre|paring not to be wanting to them&s;elves.'</P>
<P>'IF you, my countrymen! will now at length be per&s;uaded to entertain the like &s;entiments; if each of you will be di&s;po&s;|ed to approve him&s;elf an u&s;eful citizen, to the utmo&s;t that his &s;tation and abili|ties enable him; if the rich will be ready to contribute, and the young to take the field; in one word, if you will be your|&s;elves, and bani&s;h the&s;e vain hopes which every &s;ingle per&s;on entertains, that the active part of public bu&s;ine&s;s may lie up|on others and he remain at his ea&s;e; you may then, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gods, recal tho&s;e opportunities which your &s;u|pinene&s;s hath neglected, regain your do|minions, and cha&s;ti&s;e the in&s;olence of this man.'</P>
<P>'BUT when, O my countrymen! will you begin to exert your vigour? Do you wait till rou&s;ed by &s;ome dire event? till forced by &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity? When then are we to think of our pre&s;ent condition? To free men, the di&s;grace attending on mi&s;|conduct is, in my opinion, the mo&s;t ur|gent nece&s;&s;ity.

<P>'MANY, I know, delight more in no|thing than in circulating all the rumours they hear as articles of intelligence. Some cry, Philip hath joined with the Lacedae|monians, and they are concerting the de|&s;truction of Thebes. Others a&s;&s;ure us, he hath &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to the King of Per&s;ia; others, that he is fortifying places in Illyria. Thus we all go about framing our &s;everal tales. I do believe indeed, Athenians! that he is intoxicated with his greatne&s;s, and does entertain his im|agination with many &s;uch vi&s;ionary pro|jects, as he &s;ees no power ri&s;ing to op|po&s;e him. But I cannot be per&s;uaded that he hath &s;o taken his mea&s;ures, that the weake&s;t among us (for the weake&s;t they are who &s;pread &s;uch rumours) know what he is next to do. Let us di&s;regard the&s;e tales. Let us only be per&s;uaded of this, that he is our enemy; that we have long been &s;ubject to his in&s;olence; that whatever we expected to have been done
<PB N="246" REF="249">
for us by others, hath turned again&s;t us; that all the re&s;ources left, is in our&s;elves; and that if we are not inclined to carry our arms abroad, we &s;hall be forced to engage him at home. Let us be per&s;uad|ed of the&s;e things, and then we &s;hall come to a proper determination, and be no long|er guided by rumours. We need not be &s;olicitous to know what particular events are to happen. We may be well a&s;&s;ured that nothing good can happen, unle&s;s we give due attention to our own affairs, and act as becomes Athenians.'</P>
<P>'WERE it a point generally acknow|ledged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii.</NOTE> that Philip is now at actual war with the &s;tate, the only thing under de|liberation would then be, how to oppo&s;e him with mo&s;t &s;afety. But &s;ince there are per&s;ons &s;o &s;trangely infatuated, that although he has already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a con&s;iderable part of our dominions; although he is &s;till extending his con|que&s;ts; although all Greece has &s;uffered by his inju&s;tice; yet they can hear it re|peated in this A&s;&s;embly, that it is &s;ome of us who &s;eek to embroil the State in war, this &s;ugge&s;tion mu&s;t fir&s;t be guarded again&s;t. I readily admit, that were it in our power to determine whether we &s;hould be at peace or war, peace, if it de|pended on our option, is mo&s;t de&s;irable to be embraced. But if the other party
<PB N="247" REF="250">
hath drawn the &s;word, and gathered his armies round him; if he amu&s;es us with the name of peace, while, in fact, he is proceeding to the greate&s;t ho&s;tilities, what is left for us but to oppo&s;e him? If any man takes that for a peace, which is only a preparation for his leading his forces directly upon us, after his other con|que&s;ts, I hold that man's mind to be di&s;|ordered. At lea&s;t, it is only our conduct towards Philip, not Philip's conduct to|wards us, that is to be termed a peace; and this is the peace for which Philip's trea&s;ures are expended, for which his gold is &s;o liberally &s;cattered among our venal orators, that he may be at liberty to carry on the war again&s;t you, while you make no war on him.'</P>
<P>'HEAVENS! is there any man of a right mind who would judge of peace or war by words, and not by actions? Is there any man &s;o weak as to imagine that it is for the &s;ake of tho&s;e paltry villages of Thrace, Drongylus, and Cabyle, and Ma&s;tira, that Philip is now braving the utmo&s;t dangers, and enduring the &s;everity of toils and &s;ea&s;ons; and that he has no de&s;igns upon the ar&s;enals, and the navies, and the &s;ilver mines of Athens? or that he will take up his winter quarters among the cells and dungeons of Thrace, and leave you to enjoy all your revenues in peace? But you wait, perhaps, till he
<PB N="248" REF="251">
declare war again&s;t you.&mdash;He will never do &s;o&mdash;no, though he were at your gates. He will &s;till be a&s;&s;uring you that he is not at war. Such were his profe&s;&s;ions to the people of Oreum, when his forces were in the heart of their country; &s;uch his pro|fe&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e of Pherae, until the mo|ment he attacked their walls: and thus he amu&s;ed the Olynthians till he came within a few miles of them, and then he &s;ent them a me&s;&s;age, that either they mu&s;t quit their city, or he his kingdom. He would indeed be the ab&s;urde&s;t of man|kind, if, while you &s;uffer his outrages to pa&s;s unnoticed, and are wholly engaged in accu&s;ing and pro&s;ecuting one another, he &s;hould, by declaring war, put an end to your private conte&s;ts, warn you to direct all your zeal again&s;t him, and de|prive his pen&s;ioners of their mo&s;t &s;pecious pretence for &s;u&s;pending your re&s;olutions, that of his not being at war with the State. I, for my part, hold and declare, that by his attack of the Megaraeans, by his attempts upon the liberty of Eubaea, by his late incur&s;ions into Thrace, by his practices in Peloponne&s;us, Philip has violated the treaty; he is in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with you; unle&s;s you &s;hall affirm, that he who prepares to be&s;iege a city, is &s;till at peace, until the walls be actu|ally inve&s;ted. The man who&s;e de&s;igns, who&s;e whole conduct tends to reduce me to &s;ubjection, that man is at war with
<PB N="249" REF="252">
me, though not a blow hath yet been given, nor a &s;word drawn.'</P>
<P>'ALL Greece, all the barbarian world, is too narrow for this man's ambition. And, though we Greeks &s;ee and hear all this, we &s;end no emba&s;&s;ies to each other; we expre&s;s no re&s;entment; but into &s;uch wretchedne&s;s are we &s;unk, that even, to this day, we neglect what our intere&s;t and duty demand. Without engaging in a&s;&s;ociations, or forming confederacies, we look with unconcern upon Philip's growing power; each fondly imagining, that the time in which another is de&s;troy|ed, is &s;o much time gained to him; al|though no man can be ignorant, that, like the regular periodic return of a fever, he is coming upon tho&s;e who think them|&s;elves the mo&s;t remote from danger.&mdash;And what is the cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition? For &s;ome cau&s;e &s;ure there mu&s;t be, why the Greeks, who have been &s;o zealous heretofore in de|fence of liberty, are now &s;o prone to &s;lavery. The cau&s;e, Athenians! is, that a principle, which was formerly fixed in the minds of all, now exi&s;ts no more; a principle which conquered the opulence of Per&s;ia; maintained the freedom of Greece, and triumphed over the powers of &s;ea and land. That principle was, an unanimous abhorrence of all tho&s;e who accepted bribes from princes, that were
<PB N="250" REF="253">
enemies to the liberties of Greece. To be covicted of bribery, was then a crime al|together unpardonable. Neither Orators, nor Generals, would then &s;ell for gold the favourable conjunctures which fortune put into their hands. No gold could im|pair our firm concord at home, our hatred and diffidence of tyrants and barbarians. But now all things are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, as in a public market. Corruption has intro|duced &s;uch manners, as have proved the bane and de&s;truction of our country. Is a man known to have received foreign money? People envy him. Does he own it? They laugh. Is he convicted in form? They forgive him: &s;o univer&s;ally has this contagion diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among us.'</P>
<P>'IF there be any who, though not carri|ed away by bribes, yet are &s;truck with ter|ror, as if Philip was &s;omething more than human, they may &s;ee, upon a little con|&s;ideration, that he hath exhau&s;ted all tho&s;e artifices to which he owes his pre&s;ent elevation; and that his affairs are now ready to decline. For I my&s;elf, Atheni|ans! &s;hould think Philip really to be dreaded, if I &s;aw him rai&s;ed by honoura|ble means.&mdash;When forces join in harmo|ny and affection, and one common inter|e&s;t unites confederating powers, then they &s;hare the toils with alacrity, and en|dure di&s;tre&s;&s;es with per&s;everance. But when extravagant ambition, and lawle&s;s
<PB N="251" REF="254">
power, as in the ca&s;e of Philip, have ag|grandized a &s;ingle per&s;on, the fir&s;t pre|tence, the &s;lighte&s;t accident, overthrows him, and da&s;hes his greatne&s;s to the ground. For, it is not po&s;&s;ible, Atheni|ans! it is not po&s;&s;ible, to found a la&s;ting power upon inju&s;tice, perjury, and treach|ery. The&s;e may perhaps &s;ucceed for once, and borrow for a while, from hope, a gay and a &s;louri&s;hing appearance. But time betrays their weakne&s;s, and they fall of them&s;elves to ruin. For, as in &s;tructures of every kind, the lower parts &s;hould have the firme&s;t &s;tability, &s;o the grounds and principles of great enterpriz|es &s;hould be ju&s;tice and truth. But this &s;olid foundation is wanting to all the en|terprizes of Philip.'</P>
<P>'HENCE, among his confederates, there are many who hate, who di&s;tru&s;t, who envy him. If you will exert your&s;elves, as your honour and your intere&s;t require, you will not only di&s;cover the weakne&s;s and in&s;incerity of his confederates, but the ruinous condition al&s;o of his own kingdom. For you are not to imagine, that the inclinations of his &s;ubjects are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of their prince. He thir&s;ts for glory; but they have no part in this ambition. Hara&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e various excur&s;ions he is ever making, they groan under perpetual calamity; torn from their bu&s;ine&s;s and their families; and behold|ing
<PB N="252" REF="255">
commerce excluded from their coa&s;ts. All tho&s;e glaring exploits, which have given him his apparent greatne&s;s, have wa&s;ted his natural &s;trength, his own king|dom, and rendered it much weaker than it originally was. Be&s;ides, his profligacy and ba&s;ene&s;s, and tho&s;e troops of but|foons, and di&s;&s;olute per&s;ons, whom he ca|re&s;&s;es and keeps con&s;tantly about him, are, to men of ju&s;t di&s;cernment, great indicati|ons of the weakne&s;s of his mind. At pre&s;ent, his &s;ucce&s;&s;es ca&s;t a &s;hade over the&s;e things; but let his arms meet with the lea&s;t di&s;grace, his feeblene&s;s will ap|pear, and his character be expo&s;ed. For, as in our bodies, while a man is in appa|rent health, the effect of &s;ome inward de|bility, which has been growing upon him, may, for a time, be concealed; but, as &s;oon as it comes the length of di&s;ea&s;e, all his &s;ecret infirmities &s;how them&s;elves, in whatever part of his frame the di&s;or|der is lodged: &s;o, in &s;tates and monar|chies, while they carry on a war abroad, many defects e&s;cape the general eye; but, as &s;oon as war reaches their own territo|ry, their infirmities come forth to gene|ral ob&s;ervation.'</P>
<P>'FORTUNE has great influence in all human affairs; but I, for my part, &s;hould prefer the fortune of Athens, with the lea&s;t degree of vigour in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;erting your cau&s;e, to this man's fortune. For we
<PB N="253" REF="256">
have many better rea&s;ons to depend upon the favour of Heaven than this man. But, indeed, he who will not exert his own &s;trength, hath no title to depend either on his friends, or on the Gods. Is it at all &s;urpri&s;ing that he, who is him&s;elf ever amid&s;t the labours and dangers of the field; who is every where, whom no oppor|tunity e&s;capes; to whom no &s;ea&s;on is un|favourable; &s;hould be &s;uperior to you, who are wholly engaged in contriving de|lays, and framing decrees, and enquiring after news? The contrary would be much more &s;urpri&s;ing, if we, who have never hitherto acted as became a &s;tate engaged in war, &s;hould conquer one who acts, in every in&s;tance, with indefatigable vigi|lance. It is this, Athenians! it is this which gives him all his advantage again&s;t you. Philip, con&s;tantly &s;urrounded by his troops, and perpetually engaged in projecting his de&s;igns, can, in a moment, &s;trike the blow where he plea&s;es. But we, when any accident alarms us, fir&s;t ap|point our Trierarchs; then we allow them the exchange by &s;ub&s;titution: then the &s;upplies are con&s;idered; next, we re&s;olve to man our fleet with &s;trangers and fo|reigners; then find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply their place our&s;elves. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e delays, what we are &s;ailing to de|fend, the enemy is already ma&s;ter of; for the time of action is &s;pent by us in

preparing; and the i&s;&s;ues of war will not wait for our &s;low and irre&s;olute mea&s;ures.'</P>
<P>'CONSIDER then your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and make &s;uch provi&s;ion as the urgent danger requires. Talk not of your ten thou&s;ands, or your twenty thou&s;and fo|reigners; of tho&s;e armies which appear &s;o magnificent on paper only; great and terrible in your decrees, in execution weak and contemptible. But let your army be made up chiefly of the native forces of the &s;tate; let it be an Athenian &s;trength to which you are to tru&s;t; and whom&s;oever you appoint as general, let them be entirely under his guidance and authority. For, ever &s;ince our armies have been formed of foreigners alone, their victories have been gained over our allies and confederates only, while our enemies have ri&s;en to an extravagance of power."</P></Q></P>
<P>THE Orator goes on to point out the number of forces which &s;hould be rai&s;ed; the places of their de&s;tination; the &s;ea&s;on of the year in which they &s;hould &s;et out; and then propo&s;es in form his motion, as we would call it, or his decree, for the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upply of money, and for a&s;certain|ing the funds from which it &s;hould be rai&s;|ed. Having fini&s;hed all that relates to the bu&s;ine&s;s under deliberation, he concludes the&s;e Orations on public affairs, common|ly with no longer peroration than the fol|lowing,
<PB N="255" REF="258">
which terminates the Fir&s;t Philip|pic: <Q REND="inline">'I, for my part, have never, upon any occa&s;ion, cho&s;en to court your fa|vour, by &s;peaking any thing but what I was convinced would &s;erve you.

<HEAD>LECTURE XXVIII. ELOQUENCE OF THE BAR&mdash;ANA|LYSIS OF CICERO's ORATION FOR CLUENTIUS.</HEAD>
<P>I TREATED in the la&s;t Lecture, of what is peculiar to the Eloquence of Popular A&s;&s;emblies. Much of what was &s;aid on that head is applicable to the Elo|quence of the Bar, the next great &s;cene of Publick Speaking to which I now proceed, and my ob&s;ervations upon which, will therefore be the &s;horter. All, however, that was &s;aid in the former Lecture mu&s;t not be applied to it; and it is of importance, that I begin with &s;howing where the di&s;|tinction lies.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, The ends of &s;peaking at the Bar, and in Popular A&s;&s;emblies, are commonly different. In Popular A&s;&s;em|blies, the great object is per&s;ua&s;ion; the Orator aims at determining the hearers to
<PB N="257" REF="260">
&s;ome choice or conduct, as good, fit, or u&s;e|ful. For accompli&s;hing this end, it is in|cumbent on him to apply him&s;elf to all the principles of action in our nature; to the pa&s;&s;ions and to the heart, as well as to the under&s;tanding. But, at the Bar, convicti|on is the great object. There, it is not the Speaker's bu&s;ine&s;s to per&s;uade the Judges to what is good or u&s;eful, but to &s;how them what is ju&s;t and true; and, of cour&s;e, it is chiefly, or &s;olely, to the under&s;tanding that his Eloquence is addre&s;&s;ed. This is a characteri&s;tical difference which ought ever to be kept in view.</P>
<P>IN the next place, Speakers at the Bar addre&s;s them&s;elves to one, or to a few Judges, and the&s;e, too, per&s;ons generally of age, gravity, and authority of character. There, they have not tho&s;e advantages which a mixed and numerous A&s;&s;embly affords for employing all the arts of Speech, even &s;uppo&s;ing their &s;ubject to admit them. Pa&s;&s;ion does not ri&s;e &s;o ea&s;ily; the Speaker is heard more coolly; he is watched over more &s;everely; and would expo&s;e him&s;elf to ridicule, by attempting that high vehe|ment tone, which is only proper in &s;peak|ing to a multitude.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, The nature and ma|nagement of the &s;ubject which belong to the Bar, require a very different &s;pecies of Oratory from that of Popular A&s;&s;emblies.
<PB N="258" REF="261">
In the latter, the Speaker has a much wider range. He is &s;eldom confined to any preci&s;e rule; he can fetch his topics from a great variety of quarters; and em|ploy every illu&s;tration which his fancy or imagination &s;ugge&s;t. But, at the Bar, the field of &s;peaking is limited to preci&s;e law and &s;tatute. Imagination is not allowed to take its &s;cope. The Advocate has always lying before him the line, the &s;quare, and the compa&s;s. The&s;e, it is his principal bu&s;ine&s;s to be continually applying to the &s;ubjects under debate.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, it is clear, that the Eloquence of the Bar is of a much more limited, more &s;ober and cha&s;tened kind, than that of Popular A&s;&s;emblies; and, for &s;imilar rea&s;ons, we mu&s;t beware of con&s;i|dering even the judicial Orations of Cicero or Demo&s;thenes, as exact models of the manner of &s;peaking which is adapted to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Bar. It is nece&s;&s;ary to warn young Lawyers of this; becau&s;e, though the&s;e were Pleadings &s;poken in ci|vil or criminal cau&s;es, yet, in fact, the nature of the Bar antiently, both in Greece and Rome, allowed a much nearer ap|proach to Popular Eloquence, than what it now does. This was owing chiefly to two cau&s;es:</P>
<P>FIRST, Becau&s;e in the ancient Judicial Orations, &s;trict law was much le&s;s an ob+ject
<PB N="259" REF="262">
of attention than it is become among us. In the days of Demo&s;thenes and Cice|ro, the municipal &s;tatutes were few, &s;imple, and general; and the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es was tru&s;ted, in a great mea&s;ure, to the equity and common &s;en&s;e of the Judges. Eloquence, much more than Juri&s;prudence, was the &s;tudy of tho&s;e who were to plead cau&s;es. Cicero &s;omewhere &s;ays, that three months &s;tudy was &s;ufficient to make any man a complete Civilian; nay, it was thought that one might be a good Pleader at the Bar, who had never &s;tudied law at all. For there were among the Romans a &s;et of men called <HI>Pragmatici,</HI> who&s;e office it was to give the Orator all the law knowledge which the cau&s;e he was to plead required, and which he put into that popular form, and dre&s;&s;ed up with tho&s;e colours of Elo|quence, that were mo&s;t fitted for influenc|ing the Judges before whom he &s;poke.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve next, that the Civil and Criminal Judges, both in Greece and Rome, were commonly much more nume|rous than they are with us, and formed a &s;ort of Popular A&s;&s;embly. The renowned tribunal of the Areopagus at Athens con|&s;i&s;ted of fifty Judges at the lea&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Potter. Antiq. vol. i. p. 102.</NOTE>. Some make it to con&s;i&s;t of a great many more. When Socrates was condemned, by what court it is uncertain, we are informed that
<PB N="260" REF="263">
no fewer than 280 voted again&s;t him. In Rome, the Praetor, who was the proper Judge both in civil and criminal cau&s;es, named, for every cau&s;e of moment, the <HI>Judices Selecti,</HI> as they were called, who were always numerous, and had the office and power of both Judge and Jury. In the famous cau&s;e of Milo, Cicero &s;poke to fifty|one <HI>Judices Selecti,</HI> and &s;o had the advan|tage of addre&s;&s;ing his whole pleading, not to one or a few learned Judges of the point of law, as is the ca&s;e with us, but to an A&s;&s;embly of Roman citizens. Hence all tho&s;e arts of Popular Eloquence, which we find the Roman Orator &s;o frequently em|ploying, and probably with much &s;ucce&s;s. Hence tears and commi&s;eration are &s;o often made u&s;e of as the in&s;truments of gaining a cau&s;e. Hence certain practices, which would be reckoned theatrical among us, were common at the Roman Bar; &s;uch as introducing not only the accu&s;ed per&s;on dre&s;&s;ed in deep mourning, but pre&s;enting to the Judges his family, and his young children, endeavouring to move them by their cries and tears.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, on account of the wide difference between the ancient and modern &s;tate of the Bar, to which we may add al&s;o the difference in the turn of ancient and modern Eloquence, which I formerly took notice of, too &s;trict an imitation of Ci|cero's manner of pleading would now be
<PB N="261" REF="264">
extremely injudicious. To great advantage he may &s;till be &s;tudied by every Speaker at the Bar. In the Addre&s;s with which he o|pens his &s;ubject, and the in&s;inuation he em|ploys for gaining the favour of the Judges; in the di&s;tinct arrangement of his facts; in the gracefulne&s;s of his narration; in the conduct and expo&s;ition of his arguments, he may and he ought to be imitated. A higher pattern cannot be &s;et before us; but one who &s;hould imitate him al&s;o in his ex|aggeration and amplifications, in his diffu&s;e and pompous declamation, and in his at|tempts to rai&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, would now make him&s;elf almo&s;t as ridiculous at the Bar, as if he &s;hould appear there in the <HI>Toga</HI> of a Roman Lawyer.</P>
<P>BEFORE I de&s;cend to more particular directions concerning the Eloquence of the Bar, I mu&s;t be allowed to take notice, that the foundation of a Lawyer's reputation and &s;ucce&s;s, mu&s;t always be laid in a pro|found knowledge of his own profe&s;&s;ion. Nothing is of &s;uch con&s;equence to him, or de&s;erves more his deep and &s;erious &s;tudy. For whatever his abilities as a Speaker may be, if his knowledge of the law be reckoned &s;uperficial, few will cho&s;e to com|mit their cau&s;e to him. Be&s;ides previous &s;tudy, and a proper &s;tock of knowledge attained, another thing highly material to the &s;ucce&s;s of every Pleader, is, a diligent and painful attention to every cau&s;e with
<PB N="262" REF="265">
which he is intru&s;ted, &s;o as to be thorough|ly ma&s;ter of all the facts and circum&s;tances relating to it. On this the ancient Rheto|ricians in&s;i&s;t with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and ju&s;tly repre&s;ent it as a nece&s;&s;ary ba&s;is to all the Eloquence that can be exerted in plead|ing. Cicero tells us (under the character of Antonius, in the &s;econd book De Oratore), that he always conver&s;ed at full length with every client who came to con&s;ult him; that he took care there &s;hould be no wit|ne&s;s to their conver&s;ation, in order that his client might explain him&s;elf more free|ly; that he was wont to &s;tart every objec|tion, and to plead the cau&s;e of the adver&s;e party with him, that he might come at the whole truth, and be fully prepared on every point of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and that, after the client had retired, he u&s;ed to balance all the facts with him&s;elf, under three dif|ferent characters, his own, that of the Judge, and that of the Advocate on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. He cen&s;ures very &s;everely tho&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ion who decline taking &s;o much trouble; taxing them not only with &s;hameful negligence, but with di&s;ho|ne&s;ty and breach of tru&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Equidem &s;oleo dare operam, ut de &s;ua qui&s;que re me ip&s;e doceat; et nequis alius ad&s;it, qno liberius loquatur; et agere adver&s;arii cau&s;am, ut ille agat &s;uam; et quicquid de &s;ua re cogitaret, in medium proferat.

purpo&s;e Quinctilian, in the eighth chapter of his la&s;t book, delivers a great many ex|cellent rules concerning all the methods which a Lawyer &s;hould employ for attain|ing the mo&s;t thorough knowledge of the cau&s;e he is to plead; again and again re|commending patience and attention in con|ver&s;ation with clients, and ob&s;erving very &s;en&s;ibly, <Q REND="inline">"Non tam obe&s;t audire &s;urperva|cua, quam ignorare nece&s;&s;aria.

The Advocate will fre|quently di&s;cover the weak &s;ide of a cau&s;e, and learn, at the &s;ame time, what is the proper defence, from circum&s;tances which, to the party him&s;elf, appeared to be of little or no moment."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>SUPPOSING an Advocate to be thus pre|pared, with all the knowledge which the &s;tudy of the law in general, and of that cau&s;e which he is to plead in particular, can furni&s;h him, I mu&s;t next ob&s;erve, that Elo|quence in pleading is of the highe&s;t moment for giving &s;upport to a cau&s;e. It were alto|gether wrong to infer, that becau&s;e the an|cient popular and vehement manner of
<PB N="264" REF="267">
pleading is now in a great mea&s;ure &s;uper|&s;eded, there is therefore no room for Elo|quence at the Bar, and that the &s;tudy of it is become &s;uperfluous. Though the man|ner of &s;peaking be changed, yet &s;till there is a right and a proper manner, which de|&s;erves to be &s;tudied as much as ever. Per|haps there is no &s;cene of public &s;peaking where Eloquence is more nece&s;&s;ary. For on other occa&s;ions, the &s;ubject on which men &s;peak in public, is frequently &s;uffici|ent, by it&s;elf, to intere&s;t the hearers- But the dryne&s;s and &s;ubtilty of the &s;ubjects ge|nerally agitated at the Bar, require more than any other a certain kind of Eloquence in order to command attention; in order to give proper weight to the arguments that are employed, and to prevent any thing which the Pleader advances from pa&s;&s;ing unregarded. The effect of good &s;peaking is always very great. There is as much dif|ference in the impre&s;&s;ion made upon the hearers, by a cold, dry, and confu&s;ed Speaker, and that made by one who pleads the &s;ame cau&s;e with elegance, order, and &s;trength, as there is between our concepti|on of an object, when it is pre&s;ented to us in a dim light, and when we behold it in a full and clear one.</P>
<P>IT is no &s;mall encouragement to Elo|quence at the Bar, that of all the liberal profe&s;&s;ions, none gives fairer play to genius and abilities than that of the Advocate.
<PB N="265" REF="268">
He is le&s;s expo&s;ed than &s;ome others, to &s;uf|fer by the arts of rivalry, by popular preju|dices, or &s;ecret intrigues. He is &s;ure of coming forward according to his merit: For he &s;tands forth every day to view; he en|ters the li&s;t boldly with his competitors; every appearance which he makes is an ap|peal to the Public, who&s;e deci&s;ion &s;eldom fails of being ju&s;t, becau&s;e it is impartial. Intere&s;t and friends may &s;et forward a young Pleader with peculiar advantages beyond others, at the beginning; but they can do no more than open the field to him. A re|putation re&s;ting on the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances will &s;oon fall. Spectators remark, Judges de|cide, Parties watch; and to him will the multitude of Clients never fail to re&s;ort, who gives the mo&s;t approved &s;pecimens of his knowledge, eloquence, and indu&s;|try.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be laid down for a fir&s;t principle, that the Eloquence &s;uited to the Bar, whe|ther in &s;peaking or in writing law papers, is of the calm and temperate kind, and con|nected with clo&s;e rea&s;oning. Sometimes a little play may be allowed to the Imaginati|on, in order to enliven a dry &s;ubject, and to give relief to the fatigue of attention; but this liberty mu&s;t be taken with a &s;paring hand. For a Florid Style, and a &s;parkling manner, never fail to make the Speaker be heard with a jealous ear by the Judge. They detract from his weight, and always
<PB N="266" REF="269">
produce a &s;u&s;picion of his failing in &s;ound|ne&s;s and &s;trength of argument. It is puri|ty and neatne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion which is chief|ly to be &s;tudied; a Style per&s;picuous and proper, which &s;hall not be needle&s;sly over|charged with the pedantry of law terms, and where, at the &s;ame time, no affectation &s;hall appear of avoiding the&s;e, when they are &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>VERBOSITY is a common fault, of which the gentlemen of this profe&s;&s;ion are accu&s;ed; and into which the habit of &s;peaking and writing &s;o ha&s;tily, and with &s;o little prepa|ration, as they are often obliged to do, al|mo&s;t unavoidably betrays them. It cannot, therefore, be too much recommended to tho&s;e who are beginning to practice at the Bar, that they &s;hould early &s;tudy to guard again&s;t this, while as yet they have full lei|&s;ure for preparation. Let them form them|&s;elves, e&s;pecially in the papers which they write, to the habit of a &s;trong and a correct Style; which expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame thing much better in a few words, than is done by the ac|cumulation of intricate and endle&s;s periods. If this habit be once acquired, it will be|come natural to them afterwards, when the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall force them to compo&s;e in a more precipitant manner. Whereas, if the practice of a loo&s;e and ne|gligent Style has been &s;uffered to become familiar, it will not be in their power, even
<PB N="267" REF="270">
upon occa&s;ions when they wi&s;h to make an unu&s;ual effort, to expre&s;s them&s;elves with energy and grace.</P>
<P>DISTINCTNESS is a capital property in &s;peaking at the Bar. This &s;hould be &s;hown chiefly in two things; fir&s;t, in &s;tating the que&s;tion; in &s;howing clearly what is the point in debate; what we admit: what we deny; and where the line of divi&s;ion begins between us, and the adver&s;e party. Next, it &s;hould be &s;hown in the order and arrange|ment of all the parts of the pleading. In every &s;ort of Oration, a clear method is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; but in tho&s;e em|broiled and difficult ca&s;es which belong to the Bar, it is almo&s;t all in all. Too much much pains, therefore, cannot be taken in previou&s;ly &s;tudying the plan and method. If there be indi&s;tinctne&s;s and di&s;order there, we can have no &s;ucce&s;s in convincing: we leave the whole cau&s;e in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the conduct of Narrati|on and Argumentation, I &s;hall hereafter make &s;everal remarks, when I come to treat of the component parts of regular Oration. I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only ob&s;erve, that the Narration of facts at the Bar, &s;hould always be as conci&s;e as the nature of them will admit. Facts are always of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to be remembered during the cour&s;e of the pleading; but, if the Pleader be tedious in his manner of re|lating
<PB N="268" REF="271">
them, and needle&s;sly circum&s;tantial, he lays too great a load upon the memory. Whereas, by cutting off all &s;uperfluous cir|cum&s;tances in his recital, he adds &s;trength to the material facts; he both gives a clear|er view of what he relates, and makes the impre&s;&s;ion of it more la&s;ting. In Argumen|tation, again, I would incline to give &s;cope to a more diffu&s;e manner at the Bar, than on &s;ome other occa&s;ions. For in Popular A&s;&s;emblies, where the &s;ubject of debate is often a plain que&s;tion, Arguments, taken from known topics, gain &s;trength by their conci&s;ene&s;s. But the ob&s;curity of law|points frequently requires the Arguments to be &s;pread out, and placed in different lights, in order to be fully apprehended.</P>
<P>WHEN the the Pleader comes to refute the arguments employed by his adver&s;ary, he &s;hould be on his guard not to do them in|ju&s;tice, by di&s;gui&s;ing, or placing them in a fal&s;e light. The deceit is &s;oon di&s;covered: it will not fail of being expo&s;ed; and tends to impre&s;s the Judge and the Hearers with di&s;tru&s;t of the Speaker, as one who either wants di&s;cernment to perceive, or wants fairne&s;s to admit, the &s;trength of the rea&s;on|ing on the other &s;ide. Whereas, when they &s;ee that he &s;tates, with accuracy and can|dour, the Arguments which have been u&s;ed again&s;t him, before he proceeds to combat them, a &s;trong prejudice is created in his favour. They are naturally led to think,
<PB N="269" REF="272">
that he has a clear and full conception of all that can be &s;aid on both &s;ides of the Ar|gument; that he has entire confidence in the goodne&s;s of his own cau&s;e; and does not attempt to &s;upport it by any artifice or concealment. The Judge is thereby inclin|ed to receive, much more readily, the im|pre&s;&s;ions which are given by a Speaker, who appears both &s;o fair and &s;o penetrating. There is no part of the di&s;cour&s;e, in which the Orator has greater oppoortunity of &s;howing a ma&s;terly addre&s;s, than when he &s;ets him&s;elf to repre&s;ent the rea&s;onings of his antagoni&s;ts, in order to refute them.</P>
<P>WIT may &s;ometimes be of &s;ervice at the Bar, e&s;pecially in a lively reply, by which we may throw ridicule on &s;omething that has been &s;aid on the other &s;ide. But, though the reputation of wit be dazzling to a young Pleader, I woul never advi&s;e him to re&s;t his &s;trength upon this talent. It is not his bu&s;ine&s;s to make an Audience laugh, but to convince the Judge; and &s;el|dom, or never, did any one ri&s;e to eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, by being a witty Law|yer.</P>
<P>A PROPER degree of warmth in plead|ing a cau&s;e is always of u&s;e. Though, in &s;peaking to a multitude, greater vehe|mence be natural; yet, in addre&s;&s;ing our|&s;elves even to a &s;ingle man, the warmth which ari&s;es from &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and earne&s;t|ne&s;s,
<PB N="270" REF="273">
is one of the mo&s;t powerful means of per&s;uading him. An Advocate per&s;onates his client; he has taken upon him the whole charge of his intere&s;ts; he &s;tands in his place. It is improper, therefore, and has a bad effect upon the cau&s;e, if he ap|pears indifferent and unmoved; and few clients will be fond of tru&s;ting their inter|e&s;ts in the hands of a cold Speaker.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, he mu&s;t beware of pro&s;tituting his earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility &s;o much, as to enter with equal warmth into every cau&s;e that is committed to him, whether it can be &s;uppo&s;ed really to excite his zeal or not. There is a dignity of cha|racter, which it is of the utmo&s;t import+ance for every one in this profe&s;&s;ion to &s;up|port. For it mu&s;t never be forgotten, that there is no in&s;trument of per&s;ua&s;ion more powerful, than an opinion of probity and honour in the per&s;on who undertakes to per&s;uade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Plurimum ad omnia momenti e&s;t in hoc po&s;itum, &s;i vir bonus creditur.

It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for any hearer to &s;eparate altogether the impre&s;&s;ion made by the character of him that &s;peaks, from the things that he &s;ays. However &s;ecretly and imperceptibly, it will be al|ways lending its weight to one &s;ide or other; either detracting from, or adding to,

the authority and influence of his Speech. This opinion of honour and probity mu&s;t therefore be carefully pre&s;erved, both by &s;ome degree of delicacy in the choice of cau&s;es, and by the manner of conducting them. And though, perhaps, the nature of the profe&s;&s;ion may render it extremely difficult to carry this delicacy its utmo&s;t length, yet there are attentions to this point, which, as every good man for vir|tue's &s;ake, &s;o every prudent man for repu|tation's &s;ake, will find to be nece&s;&s;ary. He will always decline embarking in cau&s;es that are odious and manife&s;tly unju&s;t; and, when he &s;upports a doubtful cau&s;e, he will lay the chief &s;tre&s;s upon &s;uch argu|ments as appear to his own judgment the mo&s;t tenable; re&s;erving his zeal and his in|dignation for ca&s;es where inju&s;tice and ini|quity are flagrant. But of the per&s;onal qualities and virtues requi&s;ite in Public Speakers, I &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE are the chief directions which have occurred to me concerning the pecu|liar &s;train of Speaking at the Bar. In order to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject farther, I &s;hall give a &s;hort Analy&s;is of one of Cicero's Pleadings, or judicial Orations. I have cho&s;en that, <HI>pro Cluentio.</HI> The celebrated one <HI>pro Milone</HI> is more laboured and &s;howy; but it is too declamatory. That, <HI>pro Cluentio</HI> comes nearer the &s;train of a Modern Pleading;
<PB N="272" REF="275">
and though it has the di&s;advantage of being very long, and complicated too in the &s;ub|ject, yet it is one of the mo&s;t cha&s;te, correct and forcible of all Cicero's judicial Orations, and well de&s;erves attention for its conduct.</P>
<P>AVITUS CLUENTIUS, a Roman Knight of &s;plendid family and fortunes, had accu|&s;ed his Stepfather Oppianicus of an attempt to poi&s;on him. He prevailed in the pro&s;e|cution; Oppianicus was condemned and bani&s;hed. But as rumours aro&s;e of the Judges having been corrupted by money in this cau&s;e, the&s;e gave occa&s;ion to much po|pular clamour, and had thrown a heavy odium on Cluentius. Eight years afterwards Oppianicus died. An accu&s;ation was brought again&s;t Cluentius of having poi&s;on|ed him, together with a charge al&s;o of ha|ving bribed the Judges in the former trial to condemn him. In this action Cicero de|fends him. The accu&s;ers were Sa&s;&s;ia, the mother of Cluentius, and widow of Oppi|anicus, and young Oppianicus, the &s;on. Q. Na&s;o, the Praetor, was Judge, together with a con&s;iderable number of <HI>Judices Se|lecti.</HI></P>
<P>THE introduction of the Oration is &s;im|ple and proper, taken from no common|place topic, but from the nature of the cau&s;e. It begins with taking notice, that the whole Oration of the accu&s;er was divided into two
<PB N="273" REF="276">
parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Animadverte, Judices, omnem accu&s;atoris orationem in duas divi&s;am e&s;&s;e partes; quarum altera mihi niti et magnopere confidere videbatur, invidi&acirc; jam inveterata ju|dicii Juniani, altera tantummodo con&s;uetudinis cau&s;&acirc;, timi|d&egrave; et diffidenter attingere rationem ven&eacute;ficii criminum; qu&acirc; de re lege e&s;t haec que&s;tio con&s;tituta. Itaque mihi certum e&s;t hanc eandem di&s;tributionem invidiae et criminum &s;ic in defen|&s;ione &s;ervare, ut omnes intelligant, nihil me nec &s;ubterfuge|re volui&s;&s;e reticendo, nec ob&s;curare dicendo."</Q></NOTE>. The&s;e two parts were, the charge of having poi&s;oned Oppianicus; on which the accu&s;er, con&s;cious of having no proof, did not lay the &s;tre&s;s of his cau&s;e; but re&s;ted it chiefly on the other charge of former|ly corrupting the Judges, which was capital in certain ca&s;es, by the Roman law. Ci|cero purpo&s;es to follow him in this method, and to apply him&s;elf chiefly to the vindica|tion of his client from the latter charge. He makes &s;everal proper ob&s;ervations on the danger of Judges &s;uffering them&s;elves to be &s;wayed by a popular cry, which often is rai&s;ed by faction, and directed again&s;t the innocent. He acknowledges, that Clu|entius had &s;uffered much and long by re|proach, on account of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the former trial; but begs only a patient and attentive hearing, and a&s;&s;ures the Judges, that he will &s;tate every thing re|lating to that matter &s;o fairly and &s;o clear|ly, as &s;hall give them entire &s;atisfaction. A great appearance of candour reigns throughout this Introduction.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="277">
THE crimes with which Cluentius were charged, were heinous. A mother accu&s;|ing her &s;on, and accu&s;ing him of &s;uch ac|tions, as having fir&s;t bribed Judges to con|demn her hu&s;band, and having afterwards poi&s;oned him, were circum&s;tances that na|turally rai&s;ed &s;trong prejudices again&s;t Ci|cero's client. The fir&s;t &s;tep, therefore, ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Orator, was to remove the&s;e prejudices; by &s;hewing what &s;ort of per&s;ons Cluentius's mother, and her hu&s;|band Oppianicus, were; and thereby turn|ing the edge of public indignation again&s;t them. The nature of the cau&s;e rendered this plan altogether proper, and, in &s;imilar &s;ituations, it is fit to be imitated. He executes his plan with much eloquence and force; and, in doing it, lays open &s;uch a &s;cene of infamy and complicated guilt, as gives a &s;hocking picture of the manners of that age; and &s;uch as would &s;eem incredi|ble, did not Cicero refer to the proof that was taken in the former trial, of the facts which he alleges.</P>
<P>SASSIA, the mother, appears to have been altogether of an abandoned character. Soon after the death of her fir&s;t hu&s;band, the father of Cluentius, &s;he fell in love with Aurius Melinus, a young man of illu&s;trious birth and great fortune, who was married to her own daughter. She pre|vailed with him to divorce her daughter,
<PB N="275" REF="278">
and then &s;he married him her&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Lectum illum genialem quem biennio ante filiae &s;uae nubenti &s;traverat, in e&acirc;dem domo &s;ibi ornari et &s;terni, ex|pul&s;&acirc; atque exturbat&acirc; fili&acirc;, jubet. Nubit genero &s;ocrus, nullis au&s;picibus, fune&s;tis ominibus omnium. O mulieris &s;celus incredibile, &amp; praeter hanc unam, in omni vita inaudi|tum! O audacitm &s;ingularem! non timui&s;&s;e, &s;i minus vim Deorum, hominumque famam, at illam ip&s;am noctem, fa|ce&s;que illas nuptiales? non limen cubiculi? non cubile filiae? non parietes denique ip&s;os &s;uperiorum te&s;tes nuptia|rum? perfregit ac pro&s;travit omnia cupiditate &amp; furore; vicit pudorem libido; timorem audacia; rationem amentia."</Q>&mdash;The warmth of Cicero's Eloquence, which this pa&s;&s;age beautifully exemplifies, is here fully ju&s;tified by the &s;ubject.</NOTE>. This Melinus being afterwards, by the means of Oppianicus, involved in Sylla's pro&s;crip|tion, and put to death; and Sa&s;&s;ia being left, for the &s;econd time, a widow, and in a very opulent &s;ituation, Oppianicus him|&s;elf made his addre&s;&s;es to her. She, not &s;tartled at the impudence of the propo&s;al, nor at the thoughts of marrying one, who&s;e hands had been imbrued in her former hu&s;|band's blood, objected only, as Cicero &s;ays, to Oppianicus having two &s;ons by his pre&s;ent wife. Oppianicus removed the objection, by having his &s;ons privately di&s;|patched; and then, divorcing his wife, the infamous match was concluded between him and Sa&s;&s;ia. The&s;e flagrant deeds are painted, as we may well believe, with the highe&s;t colours of Cicero's Eloquence, which there has a very proper field. Clu|entius, as a man of honour, could no longer live on any tolerable terms with a woman, a mother only in the name, who had loaded her&s;elf and all her family with
<PB N="276" REF="279">
&s;o much di&s;honour; and hence, the feud which had ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and had involved her unfortunate &s;on in &s;o much trouble and per&s;ecution. As for Oppianicus, Cicero gives a &s;ort of hi&s;tory of his life, and a full detail of his crimes; and by what he relates, Oppiani|cus appears to have been a man daring, fierce, and cruel, in&s;atiable in avarice and ambition; trained and hardened in all the crimes which tho&s;e turbulent times of Ma|rius and Sylla's pro&s;criptions produced: <Q REND="inline">"&s;uch a man,"</Q> &s;ays our Orator, <Q REND="inline">"as in place of being &s;urpri&s;ed that he was con|demned, you ought rather to wonder that he had e&s;caped &s;o long."</Q></P>
<P>AND now, having prepared the way by all this narration, which is clear and ele|gant, he enters on the hi&s;tory of that fa|mous trial in which his client was charged with corrupting the Judges. Both Cluen|tius and Oppianicus were of the city La|rinum. In a public conte&s;t about the rights of the freemen of that city, they had taken oppo&s;ite &s;ides, which embittered the mi&s;|under&s;tanding already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them. Sa&s;&s;ia, now the wife of Oppianicus, pu&s;hed him on to the de&s;truction of her &s;on, whom &s;he had long hated, as one who was con&s;cious of her crimes; and as Cluentius was known to have made no will, they expected, upon his death, to &s;ucceed to his fortune. The plan was formed, there|fore,
<PB N="277" REF="280">
to di&s;patch him by poi&s;on; which, con&s;idering their former conduct, is no incredible part of the &s;tory. Cluentius was at that time indi&s;po&s;ed: the &s;ervant of his phy&s;ician was to be bribed to give him poi&s;on, and one Fabricius, an inti|mate friend of Oppianicus, was employed in the negociation. The &s;ervant having made the di&s;covery, Cluentius fir&s;t pro&s;e|cuted Scamander, a freedman of Fabricius, in who&s;e cu&s;tody the poi&s;on was found; and afterwards Fabricius, for this attempt upon his life. He prevailed in both acti|ons: and both the&s;e per&s;ons were con|demned by the voices, almo&s;t unanimous, of the Judges.</P>
<P>OF both the&s;e <HI>Prejudicia,</HI> as our Au|thor calls them, or previous trials, he gives a very particular account; and re&s;ts upon them a great part of his argument, as, in neither of them, there was the lea&s;t charge or &s;u&s;picion of any attempt to corrupt the Judges. But in both the&s;e trials, Oppiani|cus was pointed at plainly; in both, Sca|mander and Fabricius were pro&s;ecuted as only the in&s;truments and mini&s;ters of his cruel de&s;igns. As a natural con&s;equence, therefore, Cluentius immediately after|wards rai&s;ed a third pro&s;ecution again&s;t Op|pianicus him&s;elf, the contriver and author of the whole. It was in this pro&s;ecution, that money was &s;aid to have been given to the Judges; all Rome was filled with the
<PB N="278" REF="281">
report of it, and the alarm loudly rai&s;ed, that no man's life or liberty was &s;afe, if &s;uch dangerous practices were not checked: By the following arguments, Cicero defends his client again&s;t this heavy charge of the <HI>Crimen corrupti Judicii.</HI></P>
<P>HE rea&s;ons fir&s;t, that there was not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it; &s;eeing the con|demnation of Oppianicus was a direct and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the judgments given again&s;t Scamander and Fabricius, in the two former trials; trials, that were fair and uncorrupted, to the &s;atisfaction of the whole world. Yet by the&s;e, the road was laid clearly open to the detection of Oppianicus's guilt. His in&s;truments and mini&s;ters being once condemned, and by the very &s;ame Judges too, nothing could be more ab&s;urd than to rai&s;e a cry about an innocent per&s;on being circumvened by bribery, when it was evident, on the con|trary, that a guilty per&s;on was now brought into judgment, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, that unle&s;s the Judges were altogether in|con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to be acquitted.</P>
<P>HE rea&s;ons next, that, if in this trial there was any corruption of the Judges by money, it was infinitely more probable, that corruption &s;hould have proceeded from Oppianicus than from Cluentius. For &s;et|ting a&s;ide the difference of character be|tween
<PB N="279" REF="282">
the two men, the one fair, the other flagitious; what motive had Cluentius to try &s;o odious and dangerous an experiment, as that of bribing Judges? Was it not much more likely that he &s;hould have had recour&s;e to this la&s;t remedy, who &s;aw and knew him|&s;elf, and his cau&s;e, to be in the utmo&s;t dan|ger; than the other, who had a cau&s;e clear in it&s;elf, and of the i&s;&s;ue of which, in con|&s;equence of the two previous &s;entences given by the &s;ame Judges, he had full rea|&s;on to be confident? Was it not much more likely that he &s;hould bribe, who had every thing to fear; who&s;e life and liberty, and fortune were at &s;take; than he who had already prevailed in a material part of his charge, and who had no further intere&s;t in the i&s;&s;ue of the pro&s;ecution, than as ju&s;|tice was concerned?</P>
<P>IN the third place, he a&s;&s;erts it as a certain fact, that Oppianicus did attempt to bribe the Judges; that the corruption in this tri|al, &s;o much complained of, was employed, not by Cluentius, but again&s;t him. He calls on Titus Attius, the Orator on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; he challenges him to deny, if he can, or if he dare, that Stalenus, one of the thirty-two <HI>Judices Selecti,</HI> did receive money from Oppianicus; he names the &s;um that was given; he names the per&s;ons that were pre&s;ent, when, after the trial was over, Stalenus was obliged to refund the bribe. This is a &s;trong fact, and would &s;eem quite deci&s;ive. But, unluckily, a very
<PB N="280" REF="283">
cro&s;s circum&s;tance occurs here. For this very Stalenus gave his voice to condemn Oppianicus. For this &s;trange incident, Ci|cero accounts in the following manner: Stalenus, &s;ays he, known to be a worthle&s;s man, and accu&s;tomed before to the like prac|tices, entered into a treaty with Oppianicus to bring him off, and demanded for that pur|po&s;e a certain &s;um, which he undertook to di&s;|tribute among a competent number of the other Judges. When he was once in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the money; when he found a great|er trea&s;ure, than ever he had been ma&s;ter of, depo&s;ited in his empty and wretched ha|bitation, he became very unwilling to part with any of it to his colleagues; and be|thought him&s;elf of &s;ome means by which he could contrive to keep it all to him&s;elf. The &s;cheme which he devi&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, was, to promote the condemnation, in&s;tead of the acquittal of Oppianicus; as, from a condemned per|&s;on, he did not apprehend much danger of being called to account, or being obliged to make re&s;titution. In place, therefore, of endeavouring to gain any of his colleagues, he irritated &s;uch as he had influence with again&s;t Oppianicus, by fir&s;t promi&s;ing them money in his name, and afterwards telling them, that Oppianicus had cheated him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Cum e&s;&s;er egens, &s;umptuo&s;us, audax, callidus, perfi|dio&s;us, &amp; com domi &s;uae mi&s;&s;riimis in locis, et inani&s;&s;imis, tantum nummorum po&s;itum viderit, ad omnem malitiam &amp; fraudem ver&s;are mentem &s;uam coepit. <Q REND="inline">"Demne Judicibus? mihi igitur, ip&s;i praeter periculum et infamiam quid quaeretur?

<PB N="281" REF="284">
When &s;entence was to be pronounced, he had taken mea&s;ures for being ab&s;ent him|&s;elf; but being brought by Oppianicus's Lawyers from another court, and obliged to give his voice, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to lead the way, in condemning the man who&s;e money he had taken, without ful|filling the bargain which he had made with him.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e plau&s;ible facts and rea&s;onings, the character of Cluentius &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure cleared; and, what Cicero chiefly intended, the odium thrown upon the ad|ver&s;e party. But a difficult part of the Ora|tor's bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till remained. There were &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent deci&s;ions of the Praetor, the Cen&s;ors, and the Senate, again&s;t the Judges in this cau&s;e; which all proceeded, or &s;eemed to proceed, upon this ground of bribery and corruption: for it is plain the &s;u&s;picion prevailed, that if Oppianicus had given money to Stalenus, Cluentius had outbribed him. To all the&s;e deci&s;ions, however, Cicero replies with much di&s;tinct|ne&s;s and &s;ubtilty of argument; though it might be tedious to follow him through all
<PB N="282" REF="285">
his rea&s;onings on the&s;e heads. He &s;hows, that the facts were, at that time, very in|di&s;tinctly known; that the deci&s;ions appeal|ed to were ha&s;tily given; that not one of them concluded directly again&s;t his Client; and that &s;uch as they were, they were entirely brought about by the inflammatory and facti|ous harangues of Quinctius, the Tribune of the People, who had been the Agent and Advocate of Oppianicus; and who, enraged at the defeat he had &s;u&s;tained, had employ|ed all his tribunitial influence to rai&s;e a &s;torm again&s;t the Judges who condemned his Client.</P>
<P>AT length, Cicero comes to rea&s;on con|cerning the point of law. The <HI>Crimen Corrupti Judicii,</HI> or the bribing of the Judges, was capital. In the famous <HI>Lex Cornelia de Sicariis,</HI> was contained this clau&s;e (which we find &s;till extant, Pandect. lib. xlviii. Tit. 10. &sect; 1.) <Q REND="inline">"Qui judicem corruperit, vel corrumpendum curaverit, h&acirc;c lege teneatur."</Q> This clau&s;e, however, we learn from Cicero, was re&s;tricted to Ma|gi&s;trates and Senators; and as Cluentius was only of the Eque&s;train Order, he was not, even &s;uppo&s;ing him guilty, within the law. Of this Cicero avails him&s;elf doubly; and as he &s;hows here the mo&s;t ma&s;terly ad|dre&s;s, I &s;hall give a &s;ummary of his plead|ing on this part of the cau&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"You,"</Q> &s;ays he to the Advocate for the pro&s;ecutor, <Q REND="inline">"you, T. Attius, I know, had every where
<PB N="283" REF="286">
given it out, that I was to defend my Client, not from facts, not upon the footing of innocence, but by taking ad|vantage merely of the law in his behalf. Have I done &s;o? I appeal to your&s;elf. Have I &s;ought to cover him behind a le|gal defence only? On the contrary, have I not pleaded his cau&s;e as if he had been a Senator, liable, by the Cornelian law, to be capitally convicted; and &s;hown, that neither proof nor probable pre&s;umption lies again&s;t his innocence? In doing &s;o, I mu&s;t acquaint you, that I have compli|ed with the de&s;ire of Cluentius him&s;elf. For when he fir&s;t con&s;ulted me in this cau&s;e, and when I informed him that it was clear no action could be brought again&s;t him from the Cornelian Law, he in&s;tantly be&s;ought and obte&s;ted me, that I would not re&s;t his defence upon that ground; &s;aying, with tears in his eyes, That his reputation was as dear to him as his life; and that what he &s;ought, as an innocent man, was not only to be ab&s;olv|ed from any penalty, but to be acquitted in the opinion of all his fellow-citizens."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"HITHERTO, then, I have pleaded this cau&s;e upon his plan. But my Client mu&s;t forgive me, if now I &s;hall plead it upon my own. For I &s;hould be wanting to my&s;elf, and to that regard which my character and &s;tation require me to bear to the laws of the State, if I &s;hould al|low

any per&s;on to be judged of by a law which does not bind him.

But I mu&s;t tell you, that it would be a much greater reproach, in a State that is regulated by law, to depart from the law. What &s;afety have any of us in our per&s;ons, what &s;ecurity for our rights, if the law &s;hall be &s;et a&s;ide? By what title do you, Q. Na&s;o, &s;it in that chair, and pre&s;ide in this judgment? By what right, T. Attius, do you accu&s;e, or do I de&s;end? Whence all the &s;olemni|ty and pomp of Judges, and Clerks, and Officers, of which this hou&s;e is full?

<P>SUCH is the rea&s;oning of Cicero on this head; eloquent, &s;urely, and &s;trong. As his manner is diffu&s;e, I have greatly abridg|ed
<PB N="286" REF="289">
it from the original, but have endea|voured to detain its force.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of the Oration, Cicero treats of the other accu&s;ation that was brought again&s;t Cluentius, of having poi|&s;oned Oppianicus. On this, it appears, his accu&s;ers them&s;elves laid &s;mall &s;tre&s;s; having placed their chief hope in over|whelming Cluentius with the odium of bribery in the former trial; and, therefore, on this part of the cau&s;e, Cicero does not dwell long. He &s;hows the imbrobability of the whole tale, which they related con|cerning this pretended poi&s;oning, and makes it appear to be altogether de&s;titute of any &s;hadow of proof.</P>
<P>NOTHING, therefore, remains but the Peroration, or Conclu&s;ion of the whole. In this, as indeed throughout the whole of this Oration, Cicero is uncommonly cha&s;te, and, in the mid&s;t of much warmth and ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, keeps clear of turgid declamation. The Peroration turns on two points; the indignation which the character and con|duct of Sa&s;&s;ia ought to excite, and the compa&s;&s;ion due to a &s;on, per&s;ecuted through his whole life by &s;uch a mother.

<HEAD>LECTURE XXIX. ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE treating of the &s;tructure and component parts of a regular Oration, I purpo&s;ed making &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the peculiar &s;train, the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racters, of each of the three great kinds of Public Speaking. I have already treated of the Eloquence of Popular A&s;&s;emblies, and of the Eloquence of the Bar. The &s;ubject which remains for this Lecture is, the &s;train and &s;pirit of that Eloquence which is &s;uited to the Pulpit.</P>
<P>LET us begin with con&s;idering the ad|vantages, and di&s;advantages, which belong to this field of Public Speaking. The Pul|pit has plainly &s;everal advantages peculiar to it&s;elf. The dignity and importance of its &s;ubjects mu&s;t be acknowledged &s;uperior to any other. They are &s;uch as ought to
<PB N="291" REF="294">
intere&s;t every one, and can be brought home to every man's heart; and &s;uch as admit, at the &s;ame time, both the highe&s;t embelli&s;hment in de&s;cribing, and the greate&s;t vehemence and warmth in enforcing them. The Preacher has al&s;o great advantages in treating his &s;ubjects. He &s;peaks not to one or a few Judges, but to a large A&s;&s;embly. He is &s;ecure from all interruption. He is obliged to no replies, or extemporaneous efforts. He chu&s;es his theme at lei&s;ure; and comes to the Public with all the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance which the mo&s;t accurate premeditation can give him.</P>
<P>BUT, together with the&s;e advantages, there are al&s;o peculiar difficulties that at|tend the Eloquence of the Pulpit. The Preacher, it is true, has no trouble in con|tending with an adver&s;ary; but then, De|bate and Contention enliven the genius of men, and procure attention. The Pulpit Orator is, perhaps, in too quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his field. His &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e are, in them&s;elves, noble and important; but they are &s;ubjects trite and familiar. They have, for ages, employed &s;o many Speak|ers, and &s;o many pens; the public ear is &s;o much accu&s;tomed to them, that it re|quires more than an ordinary power of ge|nius to fix attention. Nothing within the reach of art is more difficult, than to be&s;tow, on what is common, the grace of novelty. No &s;ort of compo&s;ition whatever is &s;uch a
<PB N="292" REF="295">
trial of &s;kill, as where the merit of it lies wholly in the execution; not in giving any information that is new, not in convincing men of what they did not believe; but in dre&s;&s;ing truths which they knew, and of which they were before convinced, in &s;uch colours as may mo&s;t forcibly affect their imagination and heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject, coincides very much with the ob&s;ervations made by the famous M. Bruyere, in his <HI>Maeurs de Siecle,</HI> when he is comparing the Eloquence of the Pulpit with that of the Bar. <Q REND="inline">"L'Eloquence de la chaire, en ce qui y entre d'humain, &amp; du talent de l'orateur, e&s;t cach&eacute;e, connue de peu de per&s;onnes, &amp; d'une difficile execution.

It is to be con&s;i|dered too, that the &s;ubject of the Preacher generally confines him to ab&s;tract qualities, to virtues and vices; whereas, that of other popular Speakers leads them to treat of per&s;ons; which is a &s;ubject that commonly intere&s;ts the hearers more, and takes fa&s;ter
<PB N="293" REF="296">
hold of the imagination. The Preacher's bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;olely to make you dete&s;t the crime. The Pleader's, to make you dete&s;t the criminal. He de&s;cribes a living per|&s;on; and with more facility rou&s;es your indignation. From the&s;e cau&s;es, it comes to pa&s;s, that though we have a great num|ber of moderately good Preachers, we have, however, &s;o few that are &s;ingularly emi|nent. We are &s;till far from perfection in the art of Preaching; and perhaps there are few things, in which it is more difficult to excel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What I &s;ay here, and in other pa&s;&s;ages, of our being far from perfection in the Art of Preaching, and of their being few who are &s;ingularly eminent in it, is to be always under|&s;tood as referring to an ideal view of the perfection of this art, which none, perhaps, &s;ince the days of the Apo&s;tles, ever did, or ever will, reach. But in that degree of the Eloquence of the Pulpit, which promotes, in a con&s;iderable mea&s;ure, the great end of edification, and gives a ju&s;t title to high reputa|tion and e&s;teem, there are many who hold a very honourable rank. I agree entirely in opinion with a candid Judge (Dr. Campbell on Rhetoric, B. i. ch. 10.) who ob&s;erves, that con|&s;idering how rare the talent of Eloquence is among men, and con&s;idering all the di&s;advantages under which Preachers la|bour, particularly from the frequency of this exerci&s;e, joined with the other duties of their office, to which fixed Pa&s;tors are obliged, there is more rea&s;on to wonder that we hear &s;o many in&s;tructive, and even eloquent Sermons, than that we hear &s;o few.</NOTE>. The object, however, is noble, and worthy, upon many accounts, of be|ing pur&s;ued with zeal.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps occur to &s;ome, that preaching is no proper &s;ubject of the Art of Eloquence. This, it may be &s;aid, be|longs
<PB N="294" REF="297">
only to human &s;tudies and inven|tions: but for the truths of religion, with the greater &s;implicity, and the le&s;s mix|ture of art they are &s;et forth, they are likely to prove the more &s;ucce&s;sful. This objection would have weight, if Eloquence were, as the per&s;ons who make &s;uch an objection commonly take it to be, an o&s;ten|tatious and deceitful art, the &s;tudy of words and of plau&s;ibility only, calculated to plea&s;e, and to tickle the ear. But again&s;t this idea of Eloquence I have all along guarded. True Eloquence is the art of placing truth in the mo&s;t advantageous light for conviction and per&s;ua&s;ion. This is what every good man who preaches the Go&s;pel not only may, but ought to have at heart. It is mo&s;t intimately connected with the &s;ucce&s;s of his mini&s;try; and were it needful, as a&s;&s;uredly it is not, to rea&s;on any further on this head, we might refer to the Di&s;cour&s;es of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, as models of the mo&s;t &s;ublime and per&s;ua&s;ive Eloquence, adapted both to the imagination and the pa&s;&s;ions of men.</P>
<P>AN e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite, in order to preach well, is, to have a ju&s;t, and, at the &s;ame time, a fixed and habitual view of the end of preaching. For in no art can any man execute well, who has not a ju&s;t idea of the end and object of that art. The end of all preaching is, to per&s;uade men to become good. Every Sermon therefore &s;hould be
<PB N="295" REF="298">
a per&s;ua&s;ive Oration. Not but that the Preacher is to in&s;truct and to teach, to rea|&s;on and argue. All per&s;ua&s;ion, as I &s;how|ed formerly, is to be founded on conviction. The under&s;tanding mu&s;t always be applied to in the fir&s;t place, in order to make a la&s;t|ing impre&s;&s;ion on the heart: and he who would work on men's pa&s;&s;ions, or in|influence their practice, without fir&s;t giving them ju&s;t principles, and enlightening their minds, is no better than a mere declaimer. He may rai&s;e tran&s;ient emotions, or kindle a pa&s;&s;ing ardour; but can produce no &s;olid or la&s;ting effect. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be remembered, that all the Preachers in|&s;tructions are to be of the practical kind; and that per&s;ua&s;ion mu&s;t ever be his ulti|mate object. It is not to di&s;cu&s;s &s;ome ab|&s;tru&s;e point, that he a&s;cends the Pulpit. It is not to illu&s;trate &s;ome metaphy&s;ical truth, or to inform men of &s;omething which they never heard before; but it is to make them better men; it is to give them, at once, clear views, and per&s;ua&s;ive impre&s;&s;ions of religious truth. The Eloquence of the Pul|pit then, mu&s;t be Popular Eloquence. One of the fir&s;t qualities of preaching is to be po|pular; not in the &s;en&s;e of accommodation to the humours and prejudices of the people (which tends only to make a Preacher con|temptible), but, in the true &s;en&s;e of the word, calculated to make impre&s;&s;ion on the people; to &s;trike and to &s;eize their hearts. I &s;cruple not therefore to a&s;&s;ert, that the ab&s;tract and philo&s;ophical manner of preach|ing,
<PB N="296" REF="299">
however it may have &s;ometimes been admired, is formed upon a very faulty idea, and deviates widely from the ju&s;t plan of Pulpit Eloquence. Rational, indeed, a Preacher ought always to be; he mu&s;t give his audience clear ideas on every &s;ubject, and entertain them with &s;en&s;e, not with &s;ound; but to be an accurate rea&s;oner will be &s;mall prai&s;e, if he be not a per&s;ua&s;ive Speaker al&s;o.</P>
<P>NOW, if this be the proper idea of a Ser|mon, a per&s;ua&s;ive Oration, one very mate|rial con&s;equence follows, that the Preacher him&s;elf, in order to be &s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t be a good man. In a preceding Lecture, I en|deavoured to &s;how, that on no &s;ubject can any man be truly eloquent, who does not utter the <Q REND="inline">"verae voces ab imo pectore,"</Q> who does not &s;peak the language of his own conviction, and his own feelings. If this holds, as, in my opinion, it does in other kinds of Public Speaking, it certainly holds in the highe&s;t degree in preaching. There, it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence that the Speaker firmly believe both the truth, and the importance of tho&s;e principles which he inculcates on others; and, not only that he believe them &s;peculatively, but have a lively and &s;erious feeling of them. This will always give an earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;trength, a fervour of piety to his exhortations, &s;upe|rior in its effects to all the arts of &s;tudied Eloquence; and, without it, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art will &s;eldom be able to conceal the
<PB N="297" REF="300">
mere declaimer. A &s;pirit of true piety would prove the mo&s;t effectual guard again&s;t tho&s;e errors which Preachers are apt to com|mit. It would make their Di&s;cour&s;es &s;olid, cogent, and u&s;eful; it would prevent tho&s;e frivolous and o&s;tentatious harangues, which have no other aim than merely to make a parade of Speech, or amu&s;e an audience; and perhaps the difficulty of attaining that pitch of habitual piety and goodne&s;s, which the perfection of Pulpit Eloquence would require, and of uniting it with that tho|rough knowledge of the world, and tho&s;e other talents which are requi&s;ite for excel|ling in the Pulpit, is one of the great cau&s;es why &s;o few arrive at very high eminence in this &s;phere.</P>
<P>THE chief characteri&s;tics of the Eloquence &s;uited to the Pulpit, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other kinds of Public Speaking, appear to me to be the&s;e two, Gravity and Warmth. The &s;erious nature of the &s;ubjects belong|ing to the Pulpit, requires Gravity; their importance to mankind, requires Warmth. It is far from being either ea&s;y or common to unite the&s;e characters of Eloquence. The Grave, when it is predominant, is apt to run into a dull uniform &s;olemnity. The Warm, when it wants gravity, borders on the theatrical and light. The uni|on of the two mu&s;t be &s;tudied by all Preachers as of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, both in the compo&s;ition of their di&s;|cour&s;es, and in their manner of delivery.
<PB N="298" REF="301">
Gravity and Warmth united, form that character of preaching which the French call <HI>Onction;</HI> the affecting, penetrating, in|tere&s;ting manner, flowing from a &s;trong &s;en|&s;ibility of heart in the Preacher to the im|portance of tho&s;e truths which he delivers, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire that they may make full impre&s;&s;ion on the hearts of his Hearers.</P>
<P>NEXT to a ju&s;t idea of the nature and object of Pulpit Eloquence, the point of gre te&s;t importance to a Preacher, is a pro|per choice of the &s;ubjects on which he preaches. To give rules for the choice of &s;ubjects for Sermons, belongs to the theolo|gical more than to the rhetorical chair; on|ly in general, they &s;hould be &s;uch as appear to the Preacher to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and the be&s;t accommodated to the circum&s;tances of his Audience. No man can be called eloquent, who &s;peaks to an A&s;&s;embly on &s;ubjects, or in a &s;train, which none or few of them comprehend. The unmeaning ap|plau&s;e which the ignorant give to what is above their capacity, common &s;en&s;e, and common probity, mu&s;t teach every man to de&s;pi&s;e. U&s;efulne&s;s and true Eloquence al|ways go together; and no man can long be reputed a good Preacher who is not acknow|ledged to be an u&s;eful one.</P>
<P>THE rules which relate to the conduct of the different parts of a Sermon, the Intro|duction, Divi&s;ion, argumentative and pa|thetic
<PB N="299" REF="302">
parts, I re&s;erve to be afterwards de|livered, when treating of the conduct of a Di&s;cour&s;e in general; but &s;ome rules and ob&s;ervations, which re&s;pect a Sermon as a particular &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, I &s;hall now give, and I hope they may be of &s;ome u&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t which I &s;hall mention is, to at|tend to the Unity of a Sermon. Unity in|deed is of great con&s;equence in every com|po&s;ition; but in other Di&s;cour&s;es, where the choice and direction of the &s;ubject are not left to the Speaker, it may be le&s;s in his power to pre&s;erve it. In a Sermon, it mu&s;t be always the Preacher's own fault if he tran&s;gre&s;s it. What I mean by unity is, that there &s;hould be &s;ome one main point to which the whole &s;train of the Sermon &s;hall refer. It mu&s;t not be a bundle of different &s;ubjects &s;trung together, but one object mu&s;t predominate throughout. This rule is founded on what we all experience, that the mind can attend fully only to one capital object at a time. By dividing, you always weaken the impre&s;&s;ion. Now this Unity, without which no Sermon can either have much beauty, or much force, does not re|quire that there &s;hould be no divi&s;ions or &s;eparate heads in the Di&s;cour&s;e, or that one &s;ingle thought only &s;hould be, again and again, turned up to the hearers in different lights. It is not to be under&s;tood in &s;o nar|row a &s;en&s;e: it admits of &s;ome variety; it
<PB N="300" REF="303">
admits of underparts and appendages, pro|vided always that &s;o much Union and Con|nection be pre&s;erved, as to make the whole concur in &s;ome one impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind. I may employ, for in&s;tance, &s;everal different arguments to enforce the love of God; I may al&s;o enquire, perhaps, into the cau&s;es of the decay of this virtue; &s;till one great object is pre&s;ented to the mind; but if, becau&s;e my text &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"He that loveth God, mu&s;t love his brother al&s;o,"</Q> I &s;hould, therefore, mingle in one Di&s;cour&s;e argu|ments for the love of God and for the love of our neighbour, I would offend unpardon|ably again&s;t Unity, and leave a very loo&s;e and confu&s;ed impre&s;&s;ion on the Hearers minds.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, Sermons are always the more &s;triking, and commonly the more u&s;eful, the more preci&s;e and particular the &s;ubject of them be. This follows, in a great mea&s;ure, from what I was ju&s;t now illu&s;tra|ting. Though a general &s;ubject is capable of being conducted with a con&s;iderable de|gree of Unity, yet that Unity can never be &s;o complete as in a particular one. The impre&s;&s;ion made mu&s;t always be more un|determinate; and the in&s;truction conveyed, will commonly too, be le&s;s direct and con|vincing. General &s;ubjects, indeed, &s;uch as the excellency or the plea&s;ures of religion, are often cho&s;en by young Preachers, as the mo&s;t &s;howy, and the ea&s;ie&s;t to be handled;
<PB N="301" REF="304">
and, doubtle&s;s, general views of religion are not to be neglected, as on &s;everal occa|&s;ions they have great propriety. But the&s;e are not the &s;ubjects mo&s;t favourable for pro|ducing the high effects of preaching. They fall in almo&s;t unavoidably with the beaten tract of common-place thought. Attention is much more commanded by &s;eizing &s;ome particular view of a great &s;ubject, &s;ome &s;in|gle intere&s;ting topic, and directing to that point the whole force of Argument and Eloquence. To recommend &s;ome one grace or virtue, or to inveigh again&s;t a particular vice, furni&s;hes a &s;ubject not deficient in unity or preci&s;ion; but if we confine our|&s;elves to that virtue or vice as a&s;&s;uming a particular a&s;pect, and con&s;ider it as it ap|pears in certain characters, or affects certain &s;ituations in life, the &s;ubject becomes &s;till more intere&s;ting. The execution is, I ad|mit, more difficult, but the merit and the effect are higher.</P>
<P>IN the third place, never &s;tudy to &s;ay all that can be &s;aid upon a &s;ubject; no error is greater than this. Select the mo&s;t u&s;eful, the mo&s;t &s;triking and per&s;ua&s;ive topics which the text &s;ugge&s;ts, and re&s;t the Di&s;cour&s;e upon the&s;e. If the doctrines which Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel preach were altogether new to their hearers, it might be requi&s;ite for them to be exceeding full on every particular, le&s;t there &s;hould be any hazard of their not affording complete information. But it is
<PB N="302" REF="305">
much le&s;s for the &s;ake of information than of per&s;ua&s;ion, that Di&s;cour&s;es are delivered from the Pulpit; and nothing is more op|po&s;ite to per&s;ua&s;ion, than an unnece&s;&s;ary and tedious fulne&s;s. There are always &s;ome things which the Preacher may &s;up|po&s;e to be known, and &s;ome things which he may only &s;hortly touch. If he &s;eek to omit nothing which his &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts, it will unavoidably happen that he will en|cumber it, and weaken its force.</P>
<P>IN &s;tudying a Sermon, he ought to place him&s;elf in the &s;ituation of a &s;erious hearer. Let him &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ubject addre&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf: let him con&s;ider what views of it would &s;trike him mo&s;t; what arguments would be mo&s;t likely to per&s;uade him; what parts of it would dwell mo&s;t upon his mind. Let the&s;e be employed as his principal ma|terials; and in the&s;e, it is mo&s;t likely his genius will exert it&s;elf with the greate&s;t vi|gour. The &s;pinning and wire-drawing mode, which is not uncommon among Preachers, enervates the noble&s;t truths. It may indeed be a con&s;equence of ob&s;erving the rule which I am now giving, that fewer Sermons will be preached upon one text than is &s;ometimes done; but this will, in my opinion, be attended with no di&s;advantage. I know no benefit that ari&s;es from intro|ducing a whole &s;y&s;tem of religious truth under every text. The &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t natural method by far, is to chu&s;e that view
<PB N="303" REF="306">
of a &s;ubject to which the text principally leads, and to dwell no longer on the text, than is &s;ufficient for di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject in that view, which can commonly be done, with &s;ufficient profoundne&s;s and di&s;tinct|ne&s;s, in one or a few Di&s;cour&s;es: for it is a very fal&s;e notion to imagine, that they al|ways preach the mo&s;t profoundly, or go the deepe&s;t into a &s;ubject, who dwell on it the longe&s;t. On the contrary, that tedious cir|cuit, which &s;ome are ready to take in all their illu&s;trations, is very frequently owing, either to their want of di&s;cernment for per|ceiving what is mo&s;t important in the &s;ub|ject; or to their want of ability for placing it in the mo&s;t proper point of view.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, &s;tudy above all things to render your in&s;tructions intere&s;ting to the Hearers. This is the great trial and mark of true genius for the Eloquence of the Pulpit: for nothing is &s;o fatal to &s;ucce&s;s in preaching, as a dry manner. A dry Ser|mon can never be a good one. In order to preach in an intere&s;ting manner, much will depend upon the delivery of a Di&s;cour&s;e; for the manner in which a man &s;peaks, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence for affecting his Audience; but much will al&s;o depend on the compo&s;ition of the Di&s;cour&s;e. Correct language, and elegant de&s;cription, are but the &s;econdary in&s;truments of preaching in an intere&s;ting manner. The great &s;ecret lies, in bringing home all that is &s;poken to
<PB N="304" REF="307">
the hearts of the Hearers, &s;o as to make every man think that the Preacher is addre&s;|&s;ing him in particular. For this end, let him avoid all intricate rea&s;onings; avoid expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in general &s;peculative propo&s;itions, or laying down practical truths in an ab&s;tract metaphy&s;ical manner. As much as po&s;&s;ible, the Di&s;cour&s;e ought to be carried on in the &s;train of direct ad|dre&s;s to the Audience; not in the &s;train of one writing an e&s;&s;ay, but of one &s;peaking to a multitude, and &s;tudying to mix what is called Application, or what has an im|mediate reference to practice, with the doctrinal and didactic parts of the Ser|mon.</P>
<P>IT will be of much advantage to keep always in view the different ages, charac|ters, and conditions of men, and to accom|modate directions and exhortations to the&s;e different cla&s;&s;es of hearers. Whenever you bring forth what a man feels to touch his own character, or to &s;uit his own circum|&s;tances, you are &s;ure of intere&s;ting him. No &s;tudy is more nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, than the &s;tudy of human life, and the human heart. To be able to unfold the heart, and to di&s;cover a man to him&s;elf, in a light in which he never &s;aw his own character before, produces a wonderful ef|fect. As long as the Preacher hovers in a cloud of general ob&s;ervations, and de&s;cends not to trace the particular lines and fea|tures
<PB N="305" REF="308">
of manners, the Audience are apt to think them&s;elves unconcerned in the de&s;cription. It is the &s;triking accuracy of moral characters that gives the chief power and effect to a preacher's di&s;cour&s;e. Hence, examples founded on hi&s;torical facts, and drawn from real life, of which kind the Scriptures afford many, always, when they are well cho&s;en, command high attention. No favourable opportunity of introducing the&s;e &s;hould be omitted. They correct, in &s;ome degree, that di&s;advantage to which I before ob&s;erved preaching is &s;ubject, of being confined to treat of qualities in the ab&s;tract, not of per&s;ons, and place the weight and reality of religious truths in the mo&s;t convincing light. Perhaps the mo&s;t beautiful, and among the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ermons of any, though, indeed the mo&s;t difficult in compo&s;ition, are &s;uch as are wholly characteri&s;tical, or founded on the illu&s;tration of &s;ome peculiar character, or remarkable piece of hi&s;tory, in the &s;acred writings; by pur&s;uing which, one can trace, and lay open, &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;e|cret windings of man's heart. Other to|pics of preaching have been much beaten; but this is a field, which, wide in it&s;elf, has hitherto been little explored by the compo&s;ers of &s;ermons, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the advantages of being curious, new, and highly u&s;eful. Bi&s;hop Butler's &s;ermon on the <HI>character of Balaam,</HI> will give an idea
<PB N="306" REF="309">
of that &s;ort of preaching which I have in my eye.</P>
<P>IN the fifth and la&s;t place, Let me add a caution again&s;t taking the model of preach|ing from particular fa&s;hions that chance to have the vogue. The&s;e are torrents that &s;well to day, and have &s;pent them&s;elves by to-morrow. Sometimes it is the ta&s;te of poetical preaching, &s;ometimes of philo&s;o|phical, that has the fa&s;hion on its &s;ide; at one time it mu&s;t be all pathetic, at another time all argumentative, according as &s;ome celebrated Preacher has &s;et the example. Each of the&s;e-modes, in the extreme, is very faulty; and he who conforms him&s;elf to it, will both cramp genius, and corrupt it. It is the univer&s;al ta&s;te of mankind which is &s;ubject to no &s;uch changing modes, that alone is entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s any autho|rity; and this will never give its &s;anction to any &s;train of preaching, but what is founded on human nature, connected with u&s;efulne&s;s, adapted to the proper idea of a Sermon, as a &s;erious per&s;ua&s;ive Oration, delivered to a multitude, in order to make them better men. Let a Preacher form him&s;elf upon this &s;tandard, and keep it clo&s;e in his eye, and he will be in a much &s;urer road to reputation, and &s;ucce&s;s at la&s;t, than by a &s;ervile compliance with any popular ta&s;te, or tran&s;ient humour of his Hearers. Truth and good &s;en&s;e are firm, and will e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves; mode
<PB N="307" REF="310">
and humour are feeble and fluctuating. Let him never follow, implicitly, any one example; or become a &s;ervile imitator of any Preacher, however much admired. From various examples, he may pick up much for his improvement; &s;ome he may prefer to the re&s;t: but the &s;ervility of imi|tation extingui&s;hes all genius, or rather is a proof of the entire want of genius.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to Style, that which the Pulpit requires, mu&s;t certainly, in the fir&s;t place, be very per&s;picuous. As di&s;cour&s;es &s;poken there, are calculated for the in|&s;truction of all &s;orts of hearers, plainne&s;s and &s;implicity &s;hould reign in them. All unu&s;ual, &s;woln, or high &s;ounding words, &s;hould be avoided; e&s;pecially all words that are merely poetical, or merely philo&s;ophical. Young Preachers are apt to be caught with the glare of the&s;e; and in young Compo|&s;ers the error may be excu&s;able; but they may be a&s;&s;ured that it is an error, and pro|ceeds from their not having yet acquired a correct Ta&s;te. Dignity of expre&s;&s;ion, in|deed, the Pulpit requires in a high degree; nothing that is mean or groveling, no low or vulgar phra&s;es, ought on any account to be admitted. But this dignity is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;implicity. The words em|ployed may be all plain words, ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood, and in common u&s;e; and yet the Style may be abundantly dignified, and, at the &s;ame time, very lively and animated.
<PB N="308" REF="311">
For a lively animated Style is extremely &s;uited to the Pulpit. The earne&s;tne&s;s which a Preacher ought to feel, and the grandeur and importance of his &s;ubjects, ju&s;tify, and often require warm and glowing expre&s;|&s;ions. He not only may employ metaphors and compari&s;ons, but, on proper occa&s;ions, may apo&s;trophi&s;e the &s;aint or the &s;inner; may per&s;onify inanimate objects, break out into bold exclamations, and, in general, has the command of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate figures of Speech. But on this &s;ubject, of the proper u&s;e and management of figures, I have in&s;i&s;ted &s;o fully in former Lectures, that I have no occa&s;ion now to give parti|cular directions; unle&s;s it be only to recal to mind that mo&s;t capital rule, never to employ &s;trong figures, or a pathetic Style, except in ca&s;es where the &s;ubject leads to them, and where the Speaker is impelled to the u&s;e of them by native unaffected warmth.</P>
<P>THE language of Sacred Scripture, pro|perly employed, is a great ornament to Sermons. It may be employed, either in the way of quotation, or allu&s;ion. Direct quotations, brought from Scripture, in or|der to &s;upport what the Preacher incul|cates, both give authority to his doctrine, and render his di&s;cour&s;e more &s;olemn and venerable. Allu&s;ions to remarkable pa&s;&s;a|ges, or expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture, when in|troduced with propriety, have generally a
<PB N="309" REF="312">
plea&s;ing effect. They afford the Preacher a fund of metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion which no other compo&s;ition enjoys, and by means of which he can vary and enliven his Style. But he mu&s;t take care that any &s;uch allu|&s;ions be natural and ea&s;y; for if they &s;eem forced, they approach to the nature of con|ceits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Sherlock, when &s;howing, that the views of rea&s;on have been enlarged, and the principles of natural religion illu&s;trated, by the di&s;coveries of Chri&s;tianity, attacks unbe|lievers for the abu&s;e they make of the&s;e advantages, in the following manner: <Q REND="inline">"What a return do we make for tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings we have received? How di&s;re&s;pectfully do we treat the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, to which we owe that clear light both of rea&s;on and nature, which we now enjoy, when we endeavour to &s;et up rea&s;on and nature in oppo&s;i|tion to it? ought the <HI>withered hand,</HI> which Chri&s;t has re|&s;tored and made whole, to be lifted up again&s;t him?" <BIBL>Vol. i. Di&s;c. i.</BIBL></Q> This allu&s;ion to a noted miracle of our Lord's, appears to me happy and elegant. Dr. Seed is remarkably fond of allu&s;ions to Scripture Style; but he &s;ometimes em|ploys &s;uch as are too &s;trained and fanciful. As when he &s;ays (Serm. iv.) <Q REND="inline">"No one great virtue will come &s;ingle; the vir|tues <HI>that be her fellows will bear her company with joy and gladn&s;es.</HI>"</Q> Alluding to a pa&s;&s;age in the XLVth. P&s;alm, which relates to the virgins, the companions of the king's daughter. And (Serm. xiii.) having &s;aid, that the univer&s;ities have ju&s;tly been called the eyes of the nation, he adds, <Q REND="inline">"and <HI>if the eyes</HI> of the nation <HI>be evil, the whole body of it mu&s;t be full of darkne&s;s.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN a Sermon, no points or conceits &s;hould appear, no affected &s;martne&s;s and quaintne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e derogate much from the dignity of the Pulpit; and give to a Preacher that air of foppi&s;hne&s;s, which he ought, above all things, to &s;hun. It is rather a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ive Style, than
<PB N="310" REF="313">
a &s;parkling one, that is to be &s;tudied. But we mu&s;t beware of imagining, that we ren|der Style &s;trong and expre&s;&s;ive, by a con|&s;tant and multiplied u&s;e of epithets. This is a great error. Epithets have often great beauty and force. But if we introduce them into every Sentence, and &s;tring many of them together to one object, in place of &s;trengthening, we clog and enfeeble Style; in place of illu&s;trating the image, we ren|der it confu&s;ed and indi&s;tinct. He that tells me, <Q REND="inline">"of this peri&s;hing, mutable and tran|&s;itory world;"</Q> by all the&s;e three epithets, does not give me &s;o &s;trong an idea of what he would convey, as if he had u&s;ed one of them with propriety. I conclude this head with an advice, never to have what may be called a favourite expre&s;&s;ion; for it &s;hews affectation, and becomes di&s;gu&s;ting. Let not any expre&s;&s;ion, which is remarkable for its lu&s;tre or beauty, occur twice in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e. The repetition of it be|trays a fondne&s;s to &s;hine, and, at the &s;ame time, carries the appearance of barren in|vention.</P>
<P>AS to the que&s;tion, whether it be mo&s;t proper to write Sermons fully, and commit them accurately to memory, or to &s;tudy only the matter and thoughts, and tru&s;t the expre&s;&s;ion, in part at lea&s;t, to the de|livery? I am of opinion, that no univer&s;al rule can here be given. The choice of ei|ther of the&s;e methods mu&s;t be left to Preach|ers,
<PB N="311" REF="314">
according to their different genius. The expre&s;&s;ions which come warm and glowing from the mind, during the fervour of pronunciation, will often have a &s;upe|rior grace and energy, to tho&s;e which are &s;tudied in the retirement of the clo&s;et. But then, this fluency and power of expre&s;&s;ion cannot, at all times, be depended upon, even by tho&s;e of the readie&s;t genius; and by many can at no time be commanded, when overawed by the pre&s;ence of an Au|dience. It is proper therefore to begin, at lea&s;t, the practice of preaching, with writ|ing as accurately as po&s;&s;ible. This is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the beginning, in or|der to acquire the power and habit of cor|rect &s;peaking, nay al&s;o of correct thinking, upon religious &s;ubjects. I am inclined to go further, and to &s;ay, that it is proper not only to begin thus, but al&s;o to continue, as long as the habits of indu&s;try la&s;t, in the practice both of writing, and committing to memory. Relaxation in this particular is &s;o common, and &s;o ready to grow up|on mo&s;t Speakers in the Pulpit, that there is little occa&s;ion for giving any cautions again&s;t the extreme of overdoing in ac|curacy.</P>
<P>OF pronunciation or delivery, I am here|after to treat apart. All that I &s;hall now &s;ay upon this head is, that the practice of reading Sermons, is one of the greate&s;t ob|&s;tacles
<PB N="312" REF="315">
to the Eloquence of the Pulpit in Great Britain, where alone this practice prevails. No di&s;cour&s;e, which is de&s;igned to be per&s;ua&s;ive, can have the &s;ame force when read, as when &s;poken. The com|mon people all feel this, and their preju|dice again&s;t this practice is not without foundation in nature. What is gained here|by in point of correctne&s;s, is not equal, I apprehend, to what is lo&s;t in point of per|&s;ua&s;ion and force. They, who&s;e memories are not able to retain the whole of a di&s;|cour&s;e, might aid them&s;elves con&s;iderably by &s;hort notes lying before them, which would allow them to pre&s;erve, in a great mea&s;ure, the freedom and ea&s;e of one who &s;peaks.</P>
<P>THE French and Engli&s;h writers of Ser|mons proceed upon very different ideas of the Eloquence of the Pulpit; and &s;eem in|deed to have &s;plit it betwixt them. A French Sermon, is for mo&s;t part a warm animated exhortation; an Engli&s;h one, is a piece of cool in&s;tructive rea&s;oning. The French Preachers addre&s;s them&s;elves chief|ly to the imagination and the pa&s;&s;ions; the Engli&s;h, almo&s;t &s;olely to the under&s;tanding. It is the union of the&s;e two kinds of com|po&s;ition, of the French earne&s;tne&s;s and warmth, with the Engli&s;h accuracy and rea&s;on, that would form, according to my idea, the model of a perfect Sermon. A
<PB N="313" REF="316">
French Sermon woul &s;ound in our ears as a florid, and, often, as an enthu&s;ia&s;tic, ha|rangue.

<P>AMONG the French Prote&s;tant divines, Saurin is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed: He is copi|ous, eloquent, and devout, though too o&s;|tentatious in his manner. Among the Ro|man Catholics, the two mo&s;t eminent, are Bourdaloue and Ma&s;&s;illon. It is a &s;ubject of di&s;pute among the French Critics, to which of the&s;e the preference is due, and each of them have their &s;everal partizans. To Bourdaloue, they attribute more &s;olidi|ty and clo&s;e rea&s;oning; to Ma&s;&s;illon, a more plea&s;ing and engaging manner. Bourdaloue is indeed a great rea&s;oner, and inculcates his doctrines with much zeal, piety, and earne&s;tne&s;s; but his Style is verbo&s;e, he is di&s;agreeably full of quotations from the Fa|thers, and he wants imagination. Ma&s;&s;il|lon hae more grace, more &s;entiment, and, in my opinion, every way more genius. He di&s;covers much knowledge both of the world and of the human heart; he is pathe|tic and per&s;ua&s;ive; and, upon the whole, is perhaps, the mo&s;t eloquent writer of Ser|mons which modern times have produced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In order to give an idea of that kind of Eloquence which is employed by the French Preachers, I &s;hall in&s;ert a pa&s;&s;age from Ma&s;&s;illon, which, in the Encyclopedie, (Article, Elo|quence) is extolled by Voltaire, who was the Author of that Article, as a chef'd'oeuvre, equal to any thing of which either ancient or modern times can boa&s;t.

DURING the period that preceded the re|&s;toration of King Charles II. the Sermons of the Engli&s;h divines abounded with
<PB N="316" REF="319">
&s;chola&s;tic ca&s;ui&s;tical theology. They were full of minute divi&s;ions and &s;ubdivi&s;ions, and &s;craps of learning in the didactic part; but to the&s;e were joined very warm pathe|tic addre&s;&s;es to the con&s;ciences of the Hear|ers, in the applicatory part of the Sermon. Upon the Re&s;toration, preaching a&s;&s;umed a more correct and poli&s;hed form. It became di&s;encumbered from the pedantry, and &s;chola&s;tic divi&s;ions of the &s;ectaries; but it threw out al&s;o their warm and pathetic Ad|dre&s;&s;es, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf wholly up|on
<PB N="317" REF="320">
the modle of cool rea&s;oning, and rati|onal in&s;truction. As the Di&s;&s;enters from the Church continued to pre&s;erve &s;omewhat of the old &s;train of preaching, this led the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy to depart the farther from it. Whatever was earne&s;t and pa&s;&s;ionate, either in the compo&s;ition or delivery of Ser|mons, was reckoned enthu&s;ia&s;tic and fana|tical; and hence that argumentative man|ner, bordering on the dry and unper|&s;ua&s;ive, which is too generally the cha|racter of Engli&s;h Sermons. Nothing can be more correct upon that model than many of them are; but the model it&s;elf on which they are formed, is a confined and imperfect one. Dr. Clark, for in&s;tance, every where abounds in good &s;en&s;e, and the mo&s;t clear and accurate rea&s;oning; his applications of Scripture are pertinent; his Style is always per&s;picuous, and often ele|gant; he in&s;tructs and he convinces; in what then is he deficient? In nothing, ex|cept in the power of intere&s;ting and &s;eiz|ing the heart. He &s;hows you what you ought to do; but he excites not the de&s;ire of doing it: he treats man as if he were a being of pure intellect, without imagina|tion or pa&s;&s;ions. Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on's manner is more free and warm, and he ap|proaches nearer than mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h divines to the character of Popular Speak|ing. Hence he is, to this day, one of the be&s;t models we have for preaching. We
<PB N="318" REF="321">
mu&s;t not indeed con&s;ider him in the light of a perfect Orator: his compo&s;ition is too loo&s;e and remi&s;s; his &s;tyle too feeble, and frequently too flat, to de&s;erve that high character; but there is in &s;ome of his Ser|mons &s;o much warmth and earne&s;tne&s;s, and through them all there runs &s;o much ea&s;e and per&s;picuity, &s;uch a vein of good &s;en&s;e and &s;incere piety, as ju&s;tly intitle him to be held as eminent a Preacher as England has produced.</P>
<P>IN Dr. Barrow, one admires more the prodigious fecundity of his invention, and the uncommon &s;trength and force of his conceptions, than the felicity of his execu|tion, or his talent in compo&s;ition. We &s;ee a genius far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the common, pecu|liar indeed almo&s;t to him&s;elf; but that genius often &s;hooting wild, and uncha&s;|ti&s;ed by any Di&s;cipline or &s;tudy of Elo|quence.</P>
<P>I CANNOT attempt to give particular characters of that great number of Writers of Sermons which this, and the former age, have produced, among whom we meet with a variety of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable names. We find in their compo&s;ition much that de&s;erves prai&s;e; a great di&s;play of abilities of different kinds, much good &s;en&s;e and piety, &s;ound divinity and u&s;eful in&s;tructi|on; though in general the degree of Elo|quence
<PB N="319" REF="322">
bears not, perhaps, equal propor|tion to the goodne&s;s of the matter. Bi|&s;hop Atterbury de&s;erves being particularly mentioned as a model of correct and beau|tiful Style, be&s;ides having the merit of a warmer and more eloquent &s;train of writ|ing, in &s;ome of his Sermons, than is com|monly met with. Had Bi&s;hop Butler, in place of ab&s;tract philo&s;ophical e&s;&s;ays, given us more Sermons, in the &s;train of tho&s;e two excellent ones which he has compo&s;ed upon Self-deceit, and upon the character of Balaam, we would then have pointed him out as di&s;tingui&s;hed for that &s;pecies of characteri&s;tical Sermons which I before re|commended.</P>
<P>THOUGH the writings of the Engli&s;h di|vines are very proper to be read by &s;uch as are de&s;igned for the Church, I mu&s;t cau|tion them again&s;t making too much u&s;e of them, or tran&s;cribing large pa&s;&s;ages from them into the Sermons they compo&s;e. Such as once indulge them&s;elves in this practice, will never have any fund of their own. Infinitely better it is, to venture into the public with thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions which have occured to them&s;elves, though of in|ferior beauty, than to disfigure their com|po&s;itions, by borrowed and ill-&s;orted orna|ments, which, to a judicious eye, will be al|ways in hazard of di&s;covering their own po|verty. When a Preacher &s;its down to write on any &s;ubject, never let him begin with
<PB N="320" REF="323">
&s;eeking to con&s;ult all who have written on the &s;ame text, or &s;ubject. This, if he con|&s;ult many, will throw perplexity and con|fu&s;ion into his ideas; and, if he con&s;ults only one, will often warp him in&s;en&s;ibly into his method, whether it be right or not. But let him begin with pondering the &s;ubject on his own thoughts; let him endeavour to fetch materials from within; to collect and arrange his ideas; and form &s;ome &s;ort of plan to him&s;elf; which it is always proper to put down in writing. Then, and not till then, he may enquire how others have treated the &s;ame &s;ubject. By this means, the method, and the lead|ing thoughts in the Sermon are likely to be his own. The&s;e thoughts he may improve, by comparing them with the tract of &s;enti|ment which others have pur&s;ued; &s;ome of their &s;en&s;e he may without blame, incor|porate into his compo&s;ition; retaining al|ways his own words and &s;tyle. This is fair a&s;&s;i&s;tance: all beyond is plagiari&s;m.</P>
<P>ON the whole, never let the principle, with which we &s;et out at fir&s;t, be forgotten, to keep clo&s;e in view, the great end for which a Preacher mounts the pulpit; even to infu&s;e good di&s;po&s;itions into his hearers, to per&s;uade them to &s;erve God, and to be|come better men. Let this always dwell on his mind when he is compo&s;ing, and it will diffu&s;e through his compo&s;itions, that
<PB N="321" REF="324">
&s;pirit which will render them at once e&s;|teemed, and u&s;eful. The mo&s;t u&s;eful Preacher is always the be&s;t, and will not fail of being e&s;teemed &s;o. Embelli&s;h truth only, with a view to gain it the more full and free admi&s;&s;ion into your hearers minds; and your ornaments will, in that ca&s;e, be &s;imple, ma&s;culine, natural. The be&s;t ap|plau&s;e by far, which a Preacher can receive, ari&s;es from the &s;erious and deep impre&s;&s;ions which his di&s;cour&s;e leaves on tho&s;e who hear it. The fine&s;t encomium, perhaps, ever be&s;towed on a Preacher, was given by Louis XIV. to the eloquent Bi&s;hop of Clermont, Father Ma&s;&s;illon, whom I before mentioned with &s;o much prai&s;e. After hearing him preach at Ver&s;ailles, he &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Father, I have heard many great Orators in this Chapel; I have been high|ly plea&s;ed with them; but for you, whenever I hear you, I go away di&s;plea&s;|ed with my&s;elf; for I &s;ee more of my own character."</Q></P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXX. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF A SERMON OF BISHOP ATTER|BURY's.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t Lecture was employed in ob|&s;ervations on the peculiar and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Characters of the Eloquence pro|per for the Pulpit. But as rules and di|rections, when delivered in the ab&s;tract, are never &s;o u&s;eful as when they are illu&s;|trated by particular in&s;tances, it may, per|haps, be of &s;ome benefit to tho&s;e who are de&s;igned for the Church, that I &s;hould analy&s;e an Engli&s;h Sermon, and con&s;ider the matter of it, together with the manner. For this purpo&s;e, I have cho&s;en Bi&s;hop At|terbury as my example, who is de&s;ervedly accounted one of our mo&s;t eloquent wri|ters of Sermons, and whom I mentioned as &s;uch in the la&s;t Lecture. At the &s;ame time, he is more di&s;tingui&s;hed for elegance and purity of expre&s;&s;ion, than for profoundne&s;s
<PB N="323" REF="326">
of thought. His Style, though &s;ometimes carele&s;s, is, upon the whole, neat and cha&s;te; and more beautiful than that of mo&s;t writers of Sermons. In his &s;entiments he is not only rational; but pious and de|votional, which is a great excellency. The Sermon which I have &s;ingled out, is, that upon Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, the fir&s;t Sermon of the fir&s;t Volume, which is reck|oned one of his be&s;t. In examining it, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould u&s;e full liberty, and, together with the beauties, point out any defects that occur to me in the matter, as well as in the Style.</P>
<P>PSALM l. 14. <HI>Offer unto God Thank&s;giving.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"AMONG the many excellencies of this pious collection of hymns, for which &s;o particular a value hath been &s;et upon it by the Church of God in all ages, this is not the lea&s;t, that the true price of duties is there ju&s;tly &s;tated; men are called off from re&s;ting in the outward &s;hew of re|ligion, in ceremonies and ritual ob&s;er|vances; and taught, rather to practi&s;e (that which was &s;hadowed out by the&s;e rites, and to which they are de&s;ign|ed to lead) &s;ound inward piety and vir|tue."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE &s;everal compo&s;ers of the&s;e Hymns were <HI>Prophets;</HI> per&s;ons, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was not only to foretel events, for the
<PB N="324" REF="327">
benefit of the Church in &s;ucceeding times, but to correct and reform al&s;o what was ami&s;s among that race of men, with whom they lived and conver&s;ed; to pre&s;erve a fooli&s;h people from idolatry, and fal&s;e wor&s;hip; to re&s;cue the law from corrupt glo&s;&s;es, and &s;uper&s;titious abu&s;es; and to put men in mind of (what they are &s;o willing to forget) that eternal and invariable rule, which was before the&s;e <HI>po&s;itive</HI> duties, would continue after them, and was to be ob&s;erved, even then, in preference to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE di&s;charge, I &s;ay, of this part of the prophetic office taking up &s;o much room in the book of <HI>P&s;alms;</HI> this hath been one rea&s;on, among many others, why they have always been &s;o highly e&s;teemed; becau&s;e we are from hence fur|ni&s;hed with a proper reply to an argu|ment commonly made u&s;e of by unbe|lievers, who look upon all revealed reli|gions as pious frauds and impo&s;tures, on the account of the prejudices they have entertained in relation to that of the <HI>Jews;</HI> the whole of which they fir&s;t &s;up|po&s;e to lie in external performances, and then ea&s;ily per&s;uade them&s;elves, that God could never be the Author of &s;uch a mere piece of pageantry and empty formality, nor delight in a wor&s;hip which con&s;i&s;ted purely in a number of odd unaccountable ceremonies. Which objection of theirs,
<PB N="325" REF="328">
we &s;hould not be able thoroughly to an|&s;wer, unle&s;s we could prove (chiefly out of the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> and other parts of the pro|phetic writings) that the Jewi&s;h religion was &s;omewhat more than bare out&s;ide and &s;hew; and that inward purity, and the devotion of the heart, was a duty then, as well as now."</Q></P>
<P>THIS appears to me an excellent Intro|duction. The thought on which it re&s;ts is &s;olid and judicious; that in the book of P&s;alms, the attention of men is called to the moral and &s;piritual part of religion; and the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation thereby vindicated from the &s;u&s;picion of requiring nothing more from its votaries, than the ob&s;ervance of the external rites and ceremonies of the law. Such views of religion are proper to be often di&s;played; and de&s;erve to be in&s;i&s;t|ed on, by all who wi&s;h to render preaching conductive to the great purpo&s;e of promoting righteou&s;ne&s;s and virtue. The Style, as far as we have gone, is not only free from faults, but elegant and happy.</P>
<P>IT is a great beauty in an introduction, when it can be made to turn on &s;ome one thought, fully brought out and illu&s;trated; e&s;pecially, if that thought has a clo&s;e con|nection with the following di&s;cour&s;e, and, at the &s;ame time, does not anticipate any thing that is afterwards to be introduced in a more proper place. This Introduction of
<PB N="326" REF="329">
Atterbury's has all the&s;e advantages. The encomium which he makes on the &s;train of David's P&s;alms, is not &s;uch as might as well have been prefixed to any other di&s;cour&s;e, the text of which was taken from any of the P&s;alms. Had this been the ca&s;e, the Intro|duction would have lo&s;t much of its beauty. We &s;hall &s;ee from what follows, how natu|rally the introductory thought connects with his text, and how happily it u&s;hers it in.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"ONE great in&s;tance of this proof, we have in the words now before us; which are taken from a P&s;alm of <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> written on purpo&s;e to &s;et out the weakne&s;s and worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of external performances, when compared with more &s;ub&s;tantial and vital duties. To enforce which doc|trine, God him&s;elf is brought in as deli|vering it. <HI>Hear O my people, and I will &s;peak; O I&s;rael, and I will te&s;tify again&s;t thee: I am God, even thy God.</HI> The Pre|face is very &s;olemn, and therefore what it u&s;hers in, we may be &s;ure is of no com|mon importance; <HI>I will not reprove thee for thy &s;acrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</HI> That is, I will not &s;o reprove thee for any failures in thy &s;acrifices and burnt-offerings, as if the&s;e were the only, or the chief things I required of thee. <HI>I will take no bullock out of thy hou&s;e, nor he-goat out of thy folds;</HI> I pre&s;cribed not &s;acrifices to thee for my own &s;ake, becau&s;e I needed them;
<PB N="327" REF="330">
<HI>For every bea&s;t of the fore&s;t is mine, and the cattle on a thou&s;and hills.</HI> Mine they are, and were, before I commanded thee to offer them to me; &s;o that, as it follows, <HI>If I were hungry, yet would I not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fullne&s;s thereof.</HI> But can ye be &s;o gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, as to think me liable to hunger and thir&s;t? as to imagine that wants of that kind can touch me? <HI>Will I eat the fle&s;h of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</HI>&mdash;Thus doth he expo&s;tulate &s;everely with them, after the mo&s;t graceful manner of the Ea&s;tern Poetry. The i&s;&s;ue of which is a plain and full re&s;olution of the ca&s;e, in tho&s;e few words of the text.&mdash;<HI>Offer unto God thank&s;giving.</HI> Would you do your homage the mo&s;t agreeable way? would you render the mo&s;t acceptable of &s;ervices? <HI>offer unto God thank&s;giving.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IT is often a difficult matter to illu&s;trate gracefully the text of a Sermon from the context, and to point out the connection between them. This is a part of the di&s;|cour&s;e which is apt to become dry and te|dious, e&s;pecially when pur&s;ued into a mi|nute commentary. And therefore, except as far as &s;uch illu&s;tration from the context is nece&s;&s;ary for explaining the meaning, or in ca&s;es where it &s;erves to give dignity and force to the text, I would advi&s;e it to be al|ways treated with brevity. Sometimes it may even be wholly omitted, and the text
<PB N="328" REF="331">
a&s;&s;umed merely as an independent propo|&s;ition, if the connection with the context be ob&s;cure, and would require a laborious ex|planation. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the illu&s;|tration from the context is &s;ingularly happy. The pa&s;&s;age of the P&s;alm on which it is founded is noble and &s;pirited, and connect|ed in &s;uch a manner with the text, as to introduce it with a very &s;triking empha&s;is. On the language I have little to ob&s;erve, except that the phra&s;e, <HI>one great in&s;tance of this proof,</HI> is a clum&s;y expre&s;&s;ion. It was &s;ufficient to have &s;aid, <HI>one great proof,</HI> or <HI>one great in&s;tance, of this.</HI> In the &s;ame &s;en|tence, when he &s;peaks of <HI>&s;etting out the weakne&s;s and worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of external perfor|mances,</HI> we may ob&s;erve, that the word <HI>worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as it is now commonly u&s;ed, &s;ignifies more than the deficiency of worth, which is all that the Author means. It ge|nerally imports, a con&s;iderable degree of badne&s;s or blame. It would be more pro|per, therefore, to &s;ay, the <HI>imperfection,</HI> or the <HI>in&s;ignificancy,</HI> of external performances.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE u&s;e I intend to make of the&s;e words, is, from hence to rai&s;e &s;ome thoughts about that very excellent and important duty of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giv|ing, a &s;ubject not unfit to be di&s;cour&s;ed of at this time; whether we con&s;ider, ei|ther the more than ordinary coldne&s;s that appears of late in men's tempers towards the practice of this (or any other) part of

<P>IN this paragraph there is nothing re+markable; no particular beauty or neatne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; and the Sentence which it forms is long and tire&s;ome&mdash;<HI>to rai&s;e &s;ome thoughts about that very excellent,</HI> &amp;c. is ra|ther loo&s;e and awkward;&mdash;better&mdash;<HI>to recom|mend that very excellent,</HI> &amp;c. and when he mentions <HI>&s;etting a&s;ide</HI> a particular day in the calendar, one would imagine, that <HI>&s;etting apart</HI> would have been more proper, as to <HI>&s;et a&s;ide,</HI> &s;eems rather to &s;ugge&s;t a different idea.</P>

God; and then, how <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> it is that we &s;hould comply with it."</Q></P>
<P>THIS is the general divi&s;ion of the di&s;|cour&s;e.

<P><Q REND="inline">"OUR enquiry into what is meant here, will be very &s;hort; for who is there, that under&s;tands any thing of religion, but knows, that the offering prai&s;e and thanks to God, implies, our having a lively and devout &s;en&s;e of his excellencies, and of his benefits; our recollecting them with humility and thankfulne&s;s of heart; and our expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e inward affecti|ons by &s;uitable outward &s;igns, by reve|rent and lowly po&s;tures of body, by &s;ongs and hymns, and &s;piritual ejacula|tions; either publicly or privately; either in the cu&s;tomary and daily &s;ervice of the Church, or in its more &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies, convened upon extraordinary occa&s;ions? This is the account which every Chri&s;tan ea&s;ily gives him&s;elf of it; and which, therefore, it would be needle&s;s to enlarge upon. I &s;hall only take notice upon this head, that Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving do,
<PB N="331" REF="334">
in &s;trictne&s;s of &s;peech, &s;ignify things &s;omewhat different. Our <HI>prai&s;e</HI> properly terminates in God, on account of his na|tural excellencies and perfections; and is that act of devotion, by which we confe&s;s and admire his &s;everal attributes: but <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> is a narrower duty, and im|ports only a grateful &s;en&s;e and acknow|ledgment of pa&s;t mercies. We prai&s;e God for all his glorious acts of every kind, that regard either us or other men, for his very <HI>vengeance,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>judg|ments</HI> which he &s;ometimes &s;ends <HI>abroad in the earth;</HI> but we thank him, proper|ly &s;peaking, for the in&s;tances of his <HI>good|ne&s;s</HI> alone; and for &s;uch only of the&s;e, as we our&s;elves are &s;omeway concerned in. This, I &s;ay, is what the two words &s;trict|ly imply; but &s;ince the language of Scrip|ture is generally le&s;s exact, and u&s;eth ei|ther of them often to expre&s;s the other by, I &s;hall not think my&s;elf obliged, in what follows, thus nicely always to di&s;|tingui&s;h them."</Q></P>
<P>THERE was room here for in&s;i&s;ting more fully on the nature of the duty, than the Author has done under this head; in particular, this was the place for correcting the mi&s;take, to which men are always prone, of making Thank&s;giving to con&s;i&s;t merely in outward expre&s;&s;ions; and for &s;hewing them, that the e&s;&s;ence of the duty lies in the inward feelings of the heart. In gene|ral,
<PB N="332" REF="335">
it is of much u&s;e to give full and di&s;|tinct explications of religious duties. But, as our Author intended only one di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, he could not enlarge with equal fullne&s;s on every part of it; and he has cho&s;en to dwell on that part, on which indeed it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge, the motives enforcing the duty. For, as it is an ea&s;ier matter to know, than to practice duty, the per&s;ua&s;ive part of the di&s;cour&s;e is that to which the Speaker &s;hould always bend his chief &s;trength. The account given in this head, of the nature of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, though &s;hort, is yet compre|hen&s;ive and di&s;tinct, and the language is &s;mooth and elegant.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now the great <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of this duty of Prai&s;e or Thank&s;giving, and our &s;everal <HI>obligations</HI> to it, will appear, if we either con&s;ider it <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> in it&s;elf, as the debt of our natures; or <HI>compare</HI> it with other duties, and &s;hew the rank it bears among them; or &s;et out, in the la&s;t place, &s;ome of its peculiar properties and <HI>advantages,</HI> with regard to the devout performer of it."</Q></P>
<P>THE Author here enters upon the main part of his &s;ubject, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the duty, and mentions three arguments for proving it. The&s;e are well &s;tated, and are in them&s;elves proper and weighty con|&s;iderations. How far he has handled each
<PB N="333" REF="336">
of them to advantage, will appear as we proceed. I cannot, however, but think that he has omitted one very material part of the argument, which was to have &s;hewn the obligations we are under to this duty, from the various &s;ubjects of Thank&s;giving afforded us by the divine goodne&s;s. This would have led him to review the chief benefits of Creation, Providence, and Re|demption: and certainly, they are the&s;e which lay the foundation of the whole ar|gument for Thank&s;giving. The heart mu&s;t fir&s;t be affected with a &s;uitable &s;en&s;e of the divine benefits, before one can be excited to prai&s;e God. Iy you would per&s;uade me to be thankful to a benefactor, you mu&s;t not employ &s;uch con&s;iderations merely as tho&s;e upon which the Author here re&s;ts, taken from gratitude's being the law of my nature, or bearing a high rank among mo|ral duties, or being attended with peculiar advantages. The&s;e are con&s;iderations but of a &s;econdary nature. You mu&s;t begin with &s;etting before me all that my friend has done for me, if you mean to touch my heart, and to call forth the emotions of gratitude. The ca&s;e is perfectly &s;imilar, when we are exhorted to give thanks to God; and, therefore, in giving a full view of the &s;ubject, the ble&s;&s;ings conferred on us by divine goodne&s;s &s;hould have been taken into the argument.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="337">
IT may be &s;aid, however, in apology for our Author, that this would have led him into too wide a field for one di&s;cour&s;e, and into a field al&s;o, which is difficult, becau&s;e &s;o beaten, the enumeration of the divine benefits. He therefore &s;eems to take it for granted, that we have upon our minds a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the&s;e benefits. He a&s;&s;umes them as known and acknowledg|ed; and &s;etting a&s;ide what may be called the pathetic part of the &s;ubject, or what was calculated to warm the heart, he goes on to the rea&s;oning part. In this manage|ment, I cannot altogether blame him. I do not by any means &s;ay, that it is nece&s;&s;ary in every di&s;cour&s;e to take in all that be|longs to the doctrine of which we treat. Many a di&s;cour&s;e is &s;poiled, by attempting to render it too copious and comprehen&s;ive. The Preacher may, without reprehen&s;ion, take up any part of a great &s;ubject to which his genius at the time leads him, and make that his theme. But when he omits any thing which may be thought e&s;&s;ential, he ought to give notice, that this is a part, which for the time he lays a&s;ide. Some|thing of this &s;ort, would perhaps have been proper here. Our Author might have be|gun, by &s;aying, that the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this duty mu&s;t appear to every thinking be|ing, who reflects upon the infinite obliga|tions which are laid upon us, by creating, pre&s;erving, and redeeming love; and, after taking notice that the field which the&s;e
<PB N="335" REF="338">
open, was too wide for him to enter upon at that time, have proceeded to his other heads. Let us now con&s;ider the&s;e &s;epa|rately.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE duty of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giv|ing, con&s;idered <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> in it&s;elf, is, I &s;ay, the debt and law of our nature.

<P><Q REND="inline">"'TIS one of the earlie&s;t in&s;tructions given us by philo&s;ophy, and which hath ever &s;ince been approved and inculcated by the wi&s;e&s;t men of all ages, that the original de&s;ign of making man was, that he might prai&s;e and honour him who made him. When God had fini&s;hed this goodly frame of things we call <HI>the world,</HI> and put together the &s;everal parts of it, according to his infinite wi&s;dom, in ex|act number, weight, and mea&s;ure; there was &s;till wanting a creature, in the&s;e lower regions, that could apprehend the beauty, order, and exqui&s;ite contrivance of it; that from contemplating the gift, might be able to rai&s;e it&s;elf to the great Giver, and do honour to all his attri|butes. Every thing indeed that God
<PB N="336" REF="339">
made, did, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, glorify its Au|thor, ina&s;much as it carried upon it the plain mark and impre&s;s of the Deity, and was an effect worthy of that fir&s;t cau&s;e from whence it flowed; and thus might the <HI>Heavens</HI> be &s;aid, at the fir&s;t moment in which they &s;tood forth, <HI>to de|clare his glory, and the firmament to &s;how his handy-work:</HI> But this was an imper|fect and defective glory; the &s;ign was of no &s;ignification here below, whil&s;t there was no one here as yet to take notice of it. Man, therefore, was formed to &s;up|ply this want, endowed with powers fit to find out, and to acknowledge the&s;e unlimited perfections; and then put into this Temple of God, this lower world, as the prie&s;t of nature, to offer up the incen&s;e of Thanks and Prai&s;e for the mute and in&s;en&s;ible part of the Crea|tion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THIS, I &s;ay, hath been the opinion all along of the mo&s;t thoughtful men down from the mo&s;t ancient times: and though it be not demon&s;trative, yet it is what we cannot but judge highly rea|&s;onable, if we do but allow, that man was made for &s;ome end or other; and that he is capable of perceiving that end. For, then, let us &s;earch and enquire ne|ver &s;o much, we &s;hall find no other ac|count of him that we can re&s;t upon &s;o
<PB N="337" REF="340">
well. If we &s;ay, that he was made pure|ly for the good plea&s;ure of God; this is, in effect, to &s;ay, that he was made for no determinate end; or for none, at lea&s;t, that we can di&s;cern. If we &s;ay, that he was de&s;igned as an in&s;tance of the wi&s;dom, and power, and goodne&s;s of God; this, indeed, may be the rea&s;on of his <HI>being</HI> in general; for 'tis the common rea&s;on of the being of every thing be|&s;ides. But it gives no account, why he was made <HI>&s;uch</HI> a being as he is, a reflec|ting, thoughtful, inqui&s;itive being. The particular rea&s;on of this, &s;eems mo&s;t aptly to be drawn from the prai&s;e and honour that was (not only to redound to God from him, but) to be given to God by him."</Q></P>
<P>THE thought which runs through all this pa&s;&s;age, of man's being the Prie&s;t of Nature, and of his exi&s;tence being calculat|ed chiefly for this end, that he might offer up the prai&s;es of the mute part of the crea|tion, is an ingenious thought, and well illu&s;trated. It was a favourite idea among &s;ome of the antient philo&s;ophers; and it is not the wor&s;e on that account, as it there|by appears to have been a natural &s;enti|ment of the human mind. In compo&s;ing a Sermon, however, it might have been better to have introduced it as a &s;ort of collateral argument, or an incidental illu&s;|tration, than to have di&s;played it with &s;o
<PB N="338" REF="341">
much pomp, and to have placed it in the front of the arguments for this duty. It does not &s;eem to me, when placed in this &s;tation, to bear all the &s;tre&s;s which the Au|thor lays upon it. When the divine good|ne&s;s brought man into exi&s;tence, we can|not well conceive that its chief purpo&s;e was, to form a being who might &s;ing prai&s;es to his Maker. Prompted by infinite benevolence, the Supreme Creator formed the human race, that they might ri&s;e to happine&s;s, and to the enjoyment of him|&s;elf, through a cour&s;e of virtue, or proper action. The &s;entiment on which our Au|thor dwells, however beautiful, appears too loo&s;e and rhetorical, to be a principal head of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THIS duty, therefore, is the debt and law of our nature. And it will more di&s;tinctly appear to be &s;uch, if we con|&s;ider the two ruling faculties of our mind, the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> and the <HI>Will</HI> apart, in both which it is deeply found|ed: in the Under&s;tanding, as in the prin|ciple of Rea&s;on, which owns and ac|knowledges it; in the Will, as in the fountain of gratitude and return, which prompts, and even con&s;trains us to pay it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Rea&s;on</HI> was given us as a rule and mea|&s;ure, by the help of which we were to proportion our e&s;teem of every thing, ac|cording

to the degrees of perfection and goodne&s;s which we found therein. It cannot, therefore, if it doth its office at all, but apprehend God as the be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect being; it mu&s;t needs &s;ee, and own, and admire his infinite perfec|tions. And this is what is &s;trictly meant by <HI>prai&s;e;</HI> which, therefore, is expre&s;&s;ed in Scripture, by <HI>confe&s;&s;ing</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>acknowledging</HI> him; by <HI>a&s;cribing</HI> to him what is his due; and as far as this &s;en&s;e of the words reaches, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>think</HI> of God without prai&s;ing him; for it depends not on the under&s;tanding, how it &s;hall apprehend things, any more than it doth on the eye, how vi&s;ible objects &s;hall appear to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE duty takes the further and &s;urer hold of us, by the means of the will, and that &s;trong bent towards gratitude, which the Author of our Nature hath implant|ed in it. There is not a more active principle than this in the mind of man; and &s;urely that which de&s;erves its utmo&s;t force; and &s;hould &s;et all its &s;prings a|work, is God; the great and univer&s;al Benefactor, from whom alone we re|ceived whatever we either have, or are, and to whom we can po&s;&s;ibly repay no|thing but our Prai&s;es, or to &s;peak more properly on this head, and according to the &s;trict import of the word) our

<P>I CANNOT much approve of the light in which our Author places his argument in the&s;e paragraphs. There is &s;omething too metaphy&s;ical and refined, in his deducing, in this manner, the obligation to thank&s;|giving, from the two faculties of the mind, Under&s;tanding and Will. Though what he &s;ays be in it&s;elf ju&s;t, yet the argument is not &s;ufficiently plain and &s;triking. Ar|guments in Sermons, e&s;pecially on &s;ubjects that &s;o naturally and ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t them, &s;hould be palpable and popular; &s;hould not be brought from topics that appear far &s;ought, but &s;hould directly addre&s;s the heart and feelings. The Preacher ought never to depart too far from the common ways of thinking, and expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf. I am in|clined to think, that this whole head might have been improved, if the Author had taken up more obvious ground; had &s;tated Gratitude as one of the mo&s;t natural prin|ciples
<PB N="341" REF="344">
in the human heart; had illu&s;trated this, by &s;howing how odious the oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;ition is, and with what general con|&s;ent men, in all ages, have agreed in hat|ing, and condemning the ungrateful; and then applying the&s;e rea&s;onings to the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, had placed, in a &s;trong view, that entire corruption of moral &s;entiment which it di&s;covers, to be de&s;titute of thank|ful emotions towards the Supreme Bene|factor of Mankind. As the mo&s;t natural method of giving vent to grateful &s;enti|ments is, by external expre&s;&s;ions of thank&s;|giving, he might then have an&s;wered the objection that is apt to occur, of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of our prai&s;e being in&s;ignificant to the Almighty. But, by &s;eeking to be too refined in his argument, he has omitted &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking and obvious con|&s;iderations, and which, properly di&s;played, would have afforded as great a field for Elo|quence, as the topics which he has cho&s;en. He goes on,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"GRATITUDE con&s;i&s;ts in an equal re|turn of benefits, if we are able; of thanks, if we are not: which thanks, therefore, mu&s;t ri&s;e always in proportion as the fa|vours received are great, and the receiver incapable of making any other &s;ort of requital. Now, &s;ince no man hath bene|fited God at any time, and yet every man, in each moment of his life, is continually benefited by him, what &s;trong obligations

<P>IN the&s;e paragraphs, he has, indeed, touched &s;ome of the con&s;iderations which I mentioned. But he has only touched them; whereas, with advantage, they might have formed the main body of his argument.</P>

the noble&s;t and mo&s;t excellent; as it mu&s;t needs be, if what hath been laid down be allowed, that the end of man's crea|tion was to prai&s;e and glorify God.

Other parts of devotion, &s;uch as <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>prayer,</HI> &s;eem not originally to have been de&s;igned for man, nor man for them. They imply <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>want,</HI> with which the <HI>&s;tate of innocence</HI> was not acquainted. Had man continued in that e&s;tate, his wor&s;hip (like the devotions of angels), had been paid to Heaven in pure acts of thank&s;giving; and nothing had been left for him to do, beyond the enjoying the good things of life, as nature directed, and prai&s;ing the God of nature who be|&s;towed them. But being fallen from in|nocence and abundance; having contrac|ted guilt, and forfeited his right to all &s;orts of mercies; prayer and con&s;e&s;&s;ion became nece&s;&s;ary, for a time, to retrieve the lo&s;s, and to re&s;tore him to that &s;tate wherein he &s;hould be able to live without them.

<P>THE Author, here, enters on the &s;econd part of his argument, the high rank which thank&s;giving holds, when compared with
<PB N="345" REF="348">
other duties of religion. This he handles, with much eloquence and beauty. His idea, that this was the original wor&s;hip of man, before his fall rendered other duties requi&s;ite, and &s;hall continue to be his wor&s;hip in Heaven, when the duties which are oc|ca&s;ioned by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt &s;hall have no place, is &s;olid and ju&s;t; his illu&s;|tration of it is very happy; and the &s;tyle extremely flowing and &s;weet. Seldom do we meet with any piece of compo&s;ition in Sermons, that has more merit than this head.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"IT is &s;o, certainly, on other accounts, as well as this; particularly, as it is the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> branch of our re|ligous &s;ervice; &s;uch as hath the mo&s;t of God, and the lea&s;t of our&s;elves in it, of any we pay; and therefore approaches the neare&s;t of any to a pure, and free, and perfect act of homage. For though a good action doth not grow immediately worthle&s;s by being done with the pro&s;|pect of advantage, as &s;ome have &s;trangely imagined; yet it will be allowed, I &s;up|po&s;e, that its being done, without the mixture of that end, or with as little of it as po&s;&s;ible, recommends it &s;o much the more, and rai&s;es the price of it. <HI>Doth</HI> Job <HI>fear God for nought?</HI> was an objection of Satan; which implied, that tho&s;e du|ties were mo&s;t valuable, where our own intere&s;t was lea&s;t aimed at: and God

&s;eems, by the commi&s;&s;ion he then gave Satan, to try experiments upon <HI>Job,</HI> thus far to have allowed his plea. Now, our reque&s;ts for future, and even our acknowledgments of pa&s;t mercies, center purely in our&s;elves; our own intere&s;t is the direct aim of them. But prai&s;e is a generous and unmercenary principle, which propo&s;es no other end to it&s;elf, but to do, as is fit for a creature endow|ed with &s;uch faculties to do, towards the mo&s;t perfect and beneficent of beings; and to pay the willing tribute of honour there, where the voice of Rea&s;on directs us to pay it. God hath, indeed, annex|ed a ble&s;&s;ing to the duty; and when we know this, we cannot choo&s;e, while we are performing the duty, but have &s;ome regard to the ble&s;&s;ing which belongs to it. However, that is not the direct aim of our devotions, nor was it the fir&s;t mo|tive that &s;tirred us up to them. Had it been &s;o, we &s;hould naturally have be|taken our&s;elves to Prayer, and breathed out our de&s;ires in that form wherein they are mo&s;t properly conveyed."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"5.

Prai&s;ing, as 'tis commonly manag|ed, is nothing el&s;e but a trial of &s;kill upon a man, how many good things we can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay of him. All the trea&s;ures of Oratory are ran&s;acked, and all the fine things that ever were &s;aid, are heaped together for his &s;ake; and no matter whether it belongs to him or not; &s;o there be enough on't. Which is one deplora|ble in&s;tance, among a thou&s;and, of the ba&s;ene&s;s of human nature, of its &s;mall re|gard to truth and ju&s;tice; to right or wrong; to what is, or is not to be prai&s;|ed. But he who hath a deep &s;en&s;e of the excellencies of God upon his heart, will make a God of nothing be&s;ides. He will give every one his ju&s;t encomium, honour where honour is due, and as much as is due, becau&s;e it is his duty to do &s;o; but
<PB N="355" REF="358">
the honour of God will &s;uffer him to go no further. Which rule, if it had been ob&s;erved, a neighbouring prince (who now, God be thanked, needs flattery a great deal more than ever he did), would have wanted a great deal of that incen&s;e which hath been offered up to him by his adorers."</Q></P>
<P>THIS head appears &s;carcely to de&s;erve any place among the more important topics, that naturally pre&s;ented them&s;elves on this &s;ubject; at lea&s;t, it had much better have wanted the application which the Author makes of his rea&s;oning to the flatterers of Louis XIV.; and the thanks which he offers to God, for the affairs of that prince being in &s;o low a &s;tate, that he now needed flat|tery more than ever. This Political Satire is altogether out of place, and unworthy of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>ONE would be inclined to think, upon reviewing our Author's arguments, that he has overlooked &s;ome topics, re&s;pecting the happy con&s;equences of this duty, of fully as much importance as any that he has in&s;erted. Particularly, he ought not to have omitted the happy tendency of prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving, to &s;trengthen good di&s;po&s;itions in the heart; to promote love to God, and imitation of tho&s;e perfections which we adore; and to infu&s;e a &s;pirit of ardour and zeal into the whole of religion, as the &s;er|vice
<PB N="356" REF="359">
of our benefactor. The&s;e are con&s;e|quences which naturally follow from the proper performance of this duty; and which ought not to have been omitted; as no op|portunity &s;hould be lo&s;t, of &s;howing the good effect of devotion on practical religion and moral virtue; and pointing out the ne|ce&s;&s;ary connection of the one with the other. For certainly the great end of Preaching is, to make men better in all the relations of life, and to promote that com|plete reformation of heart and conduct, in which true Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts. Our Au|thor, however, upon the whole, is not de|ficient in &s;uch views of religion; for, in his general &s;train of preaching, as he is ex|tremely pious, &s;o he is, at the &s;ame time, practical and moral.</P>
<P>HIS &s;umming up the whole argument, in the next paragraph is elegant and beauti|ful; and &s;uch concluding views of the &s;ub|ject are frequently very proper and u&s;eful: <Q REND="inline">"Upon the&s;e grounds doth the duty of prai&s;e &s;tand, and the&s;e are the obligations that bind us to the performance of it. 'Tis the end of our being, and the very rule and law of our nature; flowing from the two great fountains of human action, the under&s;tanding and the will, natural|ly, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily. It is the mo&s;t excellent part of our religious wor&s;hip; enduring to eternity, after the re&s;t &s;hall be <HI>done away;</HI> and paid, even now, in
<PB N="357" REF="360">
the franke&s;t manner, with the lea&s;t re|gard to our own intere&s;t. It recommends it&s;elf to us by &s;everal peculiar properties and advantages; as it carries more plea|&s;ure in it, than all other kinds of devo|tion; as it enlarges and exalts the &s;everal powers of the mind; as it breeds in us an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of God's honour, and a willingne&s;s to promote it in the world; as it teaches us to be humble and lowly our&s;elves, and yet pre&s;erves us from ba&s;e and &s;ordid flattery, from be&s;towing mean and undue prai&s;es upon others."</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this, our Author addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to two cla&s;&s;es of men, the Carele&s;s and the Profane. His addre&s;s to the Carele&s;s is beautiful, and pathetic; that to the Pro|fane, is not &s;o well executed, and is liable to &s;ome objection. Such addre&s;&s;es appear to me to be, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, very u&s;eful parts of a di&s;cour&s;e. They prevail|ed much in the &s;train of preaching before the Re&s;toration; and, perhaps, &s;ince that period, have been too much neglected. They afford an opportunity of bringing home to the con&s;ciences of the audience, many things, which, in the cour&s;e of the Sermon, were, perhaps, delivered in the ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>I SHALL not dwell on the Conclu&s;ion of the Sermon, which is chiefly employed in ob&s;ervations on the po&s;ture of public affairs
<PB N="358" REF="361">
at that time. Con&s;idered, upon the whole, this Di&s;cour&s;e of Bi&s;hop Atterbury's is both u&s;eful and beautiful, though I have ven|tured to point out &s;ome defects in it. Sel|dom, or never, can we expect to meet with a compo&s;ition of any kind, which is ab&s;o|lutely perfect in all its parts: and when we take into account the difficulties which I before &s;howed to attend the Eloquence of the Pulpit, we have, perhaps, le&s;s rea&s;on to look for perfection in a Sermon, than in any other compo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXI. CONDUCT OF A DISCOURSE IN ALL ITS PARTS&mdash;INTRODUCTION&mdash;DIVISION&mdash;NARRATION AND EX|PLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE, in the four preceding Lectures, con&s;idered what is peculiar to each of the three great fields of Public Speaking, Popular A&s;&s;emblies, the Bar, and the Pul|pit. I am now to treat of what is common to them all; of the conduct of a Di&s;cour&s;e or Oration, in general. The previous view which I have given of the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;pirit and character of different kinds of Public Speaking, was nece&s;&s;ary for the pro|per application of the rules which I am about to deliver; and as I proceed, I &s;hall farther point out, how far any of the&s;e rules may have a particular re&s;pect to the Bar, to the Pulpit, or to Popular Courts.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="363">
ON whatever &s;ubject any one intends to di&s;cour&s;e, he will mo&s;t commonly begin with &s;ome introduction, in order to prepare the minds of his hearers; he will then &s;tate his &s;ubject, and explain the facts connect|ed with it; he will employ arguments for e&s;tabli&s;hing his own opinion, and over|throwing that of his antagoni&s;t; he may perhaps, if there be room for it, endeavour to touch the pa&s;&s;ions of his Audience; and after having &s;aid all he thinks proper, he will bring his Di&s;cour&s;e to a clo&s;e, by &s;ome Peroration or Conclu&s;ion. This being the natural train of Speaking, the parts that compo&s;e a regular formal Oration, are the&s;e &s;ix; fir&s;t, the Exordium or Introduction; &s;econdly, the State, and the Divi&s;ion of the Subject; thirdly, Narration, or Explication; fourthly, the Rea&s;oning or Arguments; fifthly, the Pathetic Part; and la&s;tly, the Conclu&s;ion. I do not mean, that each of the&s;e mu&s;t enter into every Public Di&s;|cour&s;e, or that they mu&s;t enter always in this order. There is no rea&s;on for being &s;o formal on every occa&s;ion; nay, it would often be a fault, and would render a Di&s;|cour&s;e pedantic and &s;tiff. There may be many excellent Di&s;cour&s;es in public, where &s;everal of the&s;e parts are altogether wanting; where the Speaker, for in&s;tance, u&s;es no In|troduction, but enters directly on his &s;ubject; where he has no occa&s;ion either to divide or explain; but &s;imply rea&s;ons on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and then fini&s;hes. But as the
<PB N="361" REF="364">
parts, which I mentioned, are the natural con&s;tituent parts of a regular Oration; and as in every Di&s;cour&s;e whatever, &s;ome of them mu&s;t be found, it is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that I &s;hould treat of each of them di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>I BEGIN, of cour&s;e, with the Exordium or Introduction. This is manife&s;tly com|mon to all the three kinds of Public Speak|ing. It is not a rhetorical invention. It is founded upon nature, and &s;ugge&s;ted by common &s;en&s;e. When one is going to coun&s;el another; when he takes upon him to in&s;truct, or to reprove, prudence will ge|nerally direct him not to do it abruptly, but to u&s;e &s;ome preparation; to begin with &s;omewhat that may incline the per&s;ons, to whom he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, to judge fa|vourably of what he is about to &s;ay; and may di&s;po&s;e them to &s;uch a train of thought, as will forward and a&s;&s;i&s;t the purpo&s;e which he has in view. This is, or ought to be, the main &s;cope of an Introduction. Ac|cordingly Cicero and Quinctilian mention three ends, to one or other of which it &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient, <Q REND="inline">"Reddere auditores benevolos, attentos, dociles."</Q></P>
<P>FIRST, To conciliate the good will of the hearers; to render them benevolent, or well-affected to the Speaker and to the &s;ub|ject. Topics for this purpo&s;e may, in Cau&s;es at the Bar, be &s;ometimes taken from the
<PB N="362" REF="365">
particular &s;ituation of the Speaker him&s;elf, or of his client, or from the character or behaviour of his antagoni&s;ts contra&s;ted with his own; on other occa&s;ions, from the na|ture of the &s;ubject, as clo&s;ely connected with the intere&s;t of the hearers: and, in general, from the mode&s;ty and good inten|tion, with which the Speaker enters upon his &s;ubject. The &s;econd end of an Intro|duction, is, to rai&s;e the attention of the hearers; which may be effected, by giving them &s;ome hints of the importance, digni|ty, or novelty of the &s;ubject; or &s;ome fa|vourable view of the clearne&s;s and preci|&s;ion with which we are to treat it; and of the brevity with which we are to di&s;cour&s;e. The third end, is to render the hearers do|cile, or open to per&s;ua&s;ion; for which end, we mu&s;t begin with &s;tudying to remove any particular prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they may have contracted again&s;t the cau&s;e, or &s;ide of the argument which we e&s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME one of the&s;e ends &s;hould be pro|po&s;ed by every Introduction. When there is no occa&s;ion for aiming at any of them; when we are already &s;ecure of the good will, the attention, and the docility of the Audience, as may often be the ca&s;e, formal Introductions can, without any prejudice, be omitted. And, indeed, when they &s;erve for no purpo&s;e but mere o&s;tentation, they had, for the mo&s;t part, better be omitted; unle&s;s as far as re&s;pect to the Audience
<PB N="363" REF="366">
makes it decent, that a Speaker &s;hould not break in upon them too abruptly, but by a &s;hort exordium prepare them for what he is going to &s;ay. Demo&s;thenes's Introducti|ons are always &s;hort and &s;imple; Cicero's are fuller and more artful.</P>
<P>THE ancient Critics di&s;tingui&s;h two kinds of Introductions, which they call <Q REND="inline">"Princi|pium,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"In&s;inuatio."</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"Principi|um"</Q> is, where the Orator plainly and di|rectly profe&s;&s;es his aim in &s;peaking. <Q REND="inline">"In|&s;inuatio"</Q> is, where a larger compa&s;s mu&s;t be taken; and where, pre&s;uming the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the Audience be to much again&s;t the Orator, he mu&s;t gradually reconcile them to hearing him, before he plainly di&s;covers the point which he has in view.</P>
<P>OF this latter &s;ort of Introduction, we have an admirable in&s;tance in Cicero's &s;econd Oration again&s;t Rullus. This Rullus was Tribune of the People, and had propo&s;ed an Agrarian Law; the purpo&s;e of which was to create a Decemvirate, or ten commi&s;&s;ioners, with ab&s;olute power for five years over all the lands conquered by the Republic, in order to divide them among the citizens. Such laws had often been propo&s;ed by factious magi&s;trates, and were always greedily received by the people. Cicero is &s;peaking to the people; he had newly been made Con&s;ul by their intere&s;t; and his fir&s;t attempt is to make them reject
<PB N="364" REF="367">
this law. The &s;ubject was extremely deli|cate, and required much art. He begins with acknowledging all the favours which he had received from the people, in prefer|ence to the nobility. He profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the creature of their power, and of all men the mo&s;t engaged to promote their intere&s;t. He declares, that he held him&s;elf to be the Con&s;ul of the People; and that he would always glory in pre&s;erving the character of a popular magi&s;trate. But to be popular, he ob&s;erves, is an ambiguous word. He under&s;tood it to import, a &s;teady attachment to the real intere&s;t of the people, to their liberty, their ea&s;e, and their peace; but by &s;ome, he &s;aw, it was abu&s;ed, and made a cover to their own &s;elfi&s;h and ambitious de|&s;igns. In this manner, he begins to draw gradually nearer to his purpo&s;e of attacking the propo&s;al of Rullus; but &s;till with great management and re&s;erve. He prote&s;ts, that he is far from being an enemy to Agra|rian Laws; he gives the highe&s;t prai&s;es to the Gracchi, tho&s;e zealous patrons of the people; and a&s;&s;ures them, that when he fir&s;t heard of Rullus's law, he had re&s;olved to &s;upport it, if he found it for their inter|e&s;t; but that, upon examining it, he found it calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h a dominion that was incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, and to aggrandize a few men at the expence of the public: and then terminates his exordium, with telling them, that he is going to give his rea&s;ons for beging of this opinion; but that
<PB N="365" REF="368">
if his rea&s;ons &s;hall not &s;atisfy them, he will give up his own opinion, and embrace theirs. In all this, there was great art. His Eloquence produced the intended ef|fect; and the people, with one voice, re|jected this Agrarian Law.</P>
<P>HAVING given the&s;e general views of the nature and end of an Introduction, I proceed to lay down &s;ome rules for the proper compo|&s;ition of it. The&s;e are the more nece&s;&s;ary, that this is a part of the Di&s;cour&s;e which re|quires no &s;mall care. Itis always of importance to begin well; to make a favourable impre&s;&s;i|on at fir&s;t &s;etting out; when the minds of the hearers, vacant as yet and free, are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to receive any impre&s;&s;ion ea&s;i|ly. I mu&s;t add too, that a good Introducti|on is often found to be extremely difficult. Few parts of the Di&s;cour&s;e give the Com|po&s;er more trouble, or are attended with more nicety in the execution.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rule is, that the Introduction &s;hould be ea&s;y and natural. The &s;ubject mu&s;t always &s;ugge&s;t it. It mu&s;t appear, as Cicero beautifully expre&s;&s;es it: <Q REND="inline">"Efflorui&s;&s;e peni|tus ex re de qua tum agitur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"To have &s;prung up, of its own accord, from the mat|ter which is under con&s;ideration."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> It is too common a fault in Introductions, that they are taken from &s;ome common-place topic, which has no peculiar relation to the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="366" REF="369">
in hand; by which means they &s;tand apart, like pieces detached from the re&s;t of the Di&s;cour&s;e. Of this kind are Sallu&s;t's Introductions, prefixed to his Catilinarian and Jugurthine wars. They might as well have been Introductions to any Hi&s;tory, or to any other Treati&s;e whatever: and, there|fore, though elegant in them&s;elves, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as blemi&s;hes in the work, from want of due connection with it. Ci|cero, though abundantly correct in this par|ticular in his Orations, yet is not &s;o in his other works. It appears from a letter of his to Atticus (L. xvi. 6.) that it was his cu&s;tom to prepare, at his lei&s;ure, a collecti|on of different Introductions or Prefaces, ready to be prefixed to any work that he might afterwards publi&s;h. In con&s;equence of this &s;trange method of compo&s;ing, it hap|pened to him, to employ the &s;ame Intro|duction twice without remembering it; pre|fixing it to two different works. Upon At|ticus informing him of this, he acknow|ledges the mi&s;take, and &s;ends him a new Introduction.</P>
<P>IN order to render Introductions natural and ea&s;y, it is, in my opinion, a good rule, that they &s;hould not be planned, till after one has meditated in his own mind the &s;ub|&s;tance of his Di&s;cour&s;e. Then, and not till then, he &s;hould begin to think of &s;ome proper and natural Introduction. By taking a contrary cour&s;e, and labouring in
<PB N="367" REF="370">
the fir&s;t place on an Introduction, every one who is accu&s;tomed to compo&s;ition will often find, that either he is led to lay hold of &s;ome common-place topic, or, that in&s;tead of the Introduction being accommo|dated to the Di&s;cour&s;e, he is obliged to ac|commodate the whole Di&s;cour&s;e to the In|troduction which he had previou&s;ly writ|ten. Cicero makes this remark; though, as we have &s;een, his practice was not al|ways conformable to his own rule. <Q REND="inline">"Om|nibus rebus con&s;ideratis, tum denique id quod primum e&s;t dicendum, po&s;tremum &s;oleo cogitare, quo utar exordio. Nam &s;i quando id primum invenire volui, nul|lum mihi occurrit, ni&s;i aut exile, aut nu|gatorium, aut vulgare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"When I have planned and dige&s;ted all the materials of my Di&s;cour&s;e, it is my cu&s;tom to think, in the la&s;t place, of the Introduction with which I am to begin. For if, at any time, I have endeavoured to invent an Introduction fir&s;t, was trifling, nugatory, and vulgar."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> After the mind has been once warmed and put in train, by clo&s;e meditation on the &s;ubject, materials for the Preface will then &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves much more readily.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, In an Introduction, correctne&s;s &s;hould be carefully &s;tudied in the expre&s;&s;ion. This is requi&s;ite, on account of the &s;ituation of the hearers. They are then more di&s;po&s;ed to critici&s;e than at any other period; they are, as yet, unoccupied
<PB N="368" REF="371">
with the &s;ubject or the arguments; their attention is wholly directed to the Speaker's &s;tyle and manner. Something mu&s;t be done, therefore, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them in his favour; though for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, too much art mu&s;t be avoided; for it will be more ea&s;ily detected at that time, than afterwards; and will derogate from per&s;ua&s;ion in all that fol|lows. A correct plainne&s;s, an elegant &s;im|plicity, is the proper character of an Intro|duction; <Q REND="inline">"ut videamur,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"accurat&egrave; non callid&egrave; dicere."</Q></P>
<P>IN the third place, Mode&s;ty is another character which it mu&s;t carry. All appear|ances of mode&s;ty are favourable, and pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. If the Orator &s;et out with an air of arrogance and o&s;tentation, the &s;elf|love and pride of the hearers will be pre|&s;ently awakened, and will follow him with a very &s;u&s;picious eye throughout all his progre&s;s. His mode&s;ty &s;hould di&s;cover it&s;elf not only in his expre&s;&s;ions at the be|ginning, but in his whole manner; in his looks, in his ge&s;tures, in the tone of his voice. Every auditory take in good part tho&s;e marks of re&s;pect and awe, which are paid to them by one who addre&s;&s;es them. Indeed the mode&s;ty of an Introduction &s;hould never betray any thing mean or abject. It is always of great u&s;e to an Orator, that together with mode&s;ty and deference to his hearers, he &s;hould &s;how a certain &s;en&s;e of dignity, ari&s;ing from a per&s;ua&s;ion of the
<PB N="369" REF="372">
ju&s;tice, or importance, of the &s;ubject on which he is to &s;peak.</P>
<P>THE mode&s;ty of an Introduction requires, that it promi&s;e not too much. <Q REND="inline">"Non fu|mum ex fulgore, &s;ed ex fumo dare lu|cem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>He does not lavi&s;h at a blaze his fire,</L>
<L>Sudden to glare, and then in &s;moke expire;</L>

<L>And pours his &s;pecious miracles to &s;ight.</L>
<BIBL>HOR. ARS POET. FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>."</Q> This certainly is the general rule, that an Orator &s;hould not put forth all his &s;trength at the beginning; but &s;hould ri&s;e and grow upon us, as his Di&s;cour&s;e ad|vances. There are ca&s;es, however, in which it is allowable for him to &s;et out from the fir&s;t in a high and bold tone; as, for in&s;tance, when he ri&s;es to defend &s;ome cau&s;e which has been much run down, and decried by the Public. Too mode&s;t a beginning, might be then like a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt. By the boldne&s;s and &s;trength of his Exor|dium, he mu&s;t endeavour to &s;tem the tide that is again&s;t him, and to remove prejudices, by encountering them with|out fear. In &s;ubjects too of a declama|tory nature, and in Sermons, where the &s;ubject is &s;triking, a magnificent Intro|duction has &s;ometimes a good effect, if it be properly &s;upported in the &s;equel. Thus Bi&s;hop Atterbury, in beginning an eloquent Sermon, preached on the 30th of January, the Anniver&s;ary of what is called King
<PB N="370" REF="373">
Charles's Martyrdom, &s;ets out in this pompous manner: <Q REND="inline">"This is a day of Trou|ble, of Rebuke, and of Bla&s;phemy; di&s;|tingui&s;hed in the Calendar of our Church, and the annals of our Nation, by the &s;uf|ferings of an excellent Prince, who fell a &s;acrifice to the rage of his rebellious &s;ub|jects; and, by his fall, derived infamy, mi&s;ery, and guilt on them, and their &s;in|ful po&s;terity."</Q> Bo&s;&s;uet, Flechier, and the other celebrated French Preachers very of|ten begin their Di&s;cour&s;eswith laboured and &s;ublime Introductions. The&s;e rai&s;e atten|tion, and throw a lu&s;tre on the &s;ubject: but let every Speaker be much on his guard again&s;t &s;triking a higher note at the begin|ning, than he is able to keep up in his pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, An Introduction &s;hould u&s;ually be carried on in the calm manner. This is &s;eldom the place for vehe|mence and pa&s;&s;ion. Emotions mu&s;t ri&s;e, as the Di&s;cour&s;e advances. The minds of the hearers mu&s;t be gradually prepared, be|fore the Speaker can venture on &s;trong and pa&s;&s;ionate &s;entiments. The exceptions to this rule are, when the &s;ubject is &s;uch, that the very mention of it naturally awakens &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate emotion; or when the un|expected pre&s;ence of &s;ome per&s;on or object, in a Popular A&s;&s;embly, inflames the Speak|er, and makes him break forth with unu|&s;ual warmth. Either of the&s;e will ju&s;tify
<PB N="371" REF="374">
what is called, the Exordium <HI>ab abrupto.</HI> Thus the appearance of Catiline in the Se|nate, renders the vehement beginning of Cicero's fir&s;t Oration again&s;t him very natu|ral and proper. <Q REND="inline">"Quou&s;que tandem, Cati|lina, abutere patientia no&s;tra?"</Q> And thus Bi&s;hop Atterbury, in preaching from this text, <Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;&s;ed is he, who&s;oever &s;hall not be offended in me,"</Q> ventures on breaking forth with this bold Exordium; <Q REND="inline">"And can any man then be offended in thee, ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us?"</Q> which addre&s;s to our Saviour, he continues for a page or two, till he en|ters on the divi&s;ion of his &s;ubject. But &s;uch Introductions as the&s;e &s;hould be ha|zarded by very few, as they promi&s;e &s;o much vehemence and unction through the re&s;t of the Di&s;cour&s;e, that it is very diffi|cult to fulfil the expectations of the hearers.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, though the Introduc|tion is not the place in which warm emo|tions are u&s;ually to be attempted, yet I mu&s;t take notice, that it ought to prepare the way for &s;uch as are de&s;igned to be rai&s;ed in &s;ub&s;equent parts of the Di&s;cour&s;e. The Orator &s;hould, in the beginning, turn the minds of his hearers towards tho&s;e &s;enti|ments and feelings which he &s;eeks to awak|en in the cour&s;e of his Speech. According, for in&s;tance, as it is compa&s;&s;ion, or indig|nation, or contempt, on which his Di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="372" REF="375">
is to re&s;t, he ought to &s;ow the &s;eeds of the&s;e in his Introduction; he ought to begin with breathing that &s;pirit which he means to in&s;pire. Much of the Orator's art and ability is &s;hown, in thus &s;triking properly at the commencement, the key note, if we may &s;o expre&s;s it, of the re&s;t of his Oration.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, It is a rule in Intro|ductions, not to anticipate any material part of the &s;ubject. When topics, or ar|guments, which are afterwards to be en|larged upon, are hinted at, and, in part, brought forth in the Introduction, they lo&s;e the grace of novelty upon their &s;econd ap|pearance. The impre&s;&s;ion intended to be made by any capital thought, is always made with the greate&s;t advantage, when it is made entire, and in its proper place.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, The Introduction ought to be proportioned, both in length and in kind, to the di&s;cour&s;e that is to follow: in length, as nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to erect a very great portico before a &s;mall building; and in kind, as it is no le&s;s ab|&s;urd to overcharge, with &s;uperb ornaments, the portico of a plain dwelling-hou&s;e, or to make the entrance to a monument as gay as that to an arbour. Common &s;en&s;e di|rects, that every part of a Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be &s;uited to the &s;train and &s;pirit of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="376">
THESE are the principal rules that relate to Introductions. They are adapted, in a great mea&s;ure, equally, to Di&s;cour&s;es of all kinds. In Pleadings at the Bar, or Speeches in Public A&s;&s;emblies, particular care mu&s;t be taken not to employ any Introduction of that kind, which the adver&s;e party may lay hold of, and turn to his advantage. To this inconvenience, all tho&s;e Introductions are expo&s;ed, which are taken from general and common-place topics; and it never fails to give an adver&s;ary a con&s;iderable triumph, if, by giving a &s;mall turn to &s;ome|thing we had &s;aid in our Exordium, he can appear to convert, to his own favour, the principles with which we had &s;et out, in beginning our attack upon him. In the ca&s;e of Replies, Quinctilian makes an ob|&s;ervation which is very worthy of notice; that Introductions, drawn from &s;omething that has been &s;aid in the cour&s;e of the De|bate, have always a peculiar grace; and the rea&s;on he gives for it is ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible: <Q REND="inline">"Multum gratiae exordio e&s;t, quod ab ac|tione diver&s;ae partis materiam trahit; hoc ip&s;o, quod non compo&s;itum domi, &s;ed ibi atque e re natum; et facilitate famam ingenii auget; et facie &s;impli|cis, &s;umptique e proximo &s;ermonis, fi|dem quoque acquirit; adeo, ut etiam&s;i reliqua &s;cripta atque elaborara &s;int, ta|men videatur tota extemporalis oratio,
<PB N="374" REF="377">
cujus initium nihil preparatum habui&s;&s;e, manife&s;tum e&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"An Introduction, which is founded upon the pleading of the oppo&s;ite party, is extremely graceful; for this rea|&s;on, that it appears not to have been meditated at home, but to have taken ri&s;e from the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to have been compo&s;ed on the &s;pot. Hence, it gives to the Speaker the reputation of a quick invention, and adds weight likewi&s;e to his Di&s;cour&s;e, as artle&s;s and unlaboured; in&s;omuch, that though all the re&s;t of his Oration &s;hould be &s;tudied and written, yet the whole Di&s;cour&s;e has the appearance of be|ing extemporary, as it is evident that the Introduction to it was unpremeditated."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>IN Sermons, &s;uch a practice as this can|not take place; and, indeed, in compo&s;ing Sermons, few things are more difficult than to remove an appearance of &s;tiffne&s;s from an Introduction, when a formal one is u&s;ed. The French Preachers, as I before ob&s;erved, are often very &s;plendid and lively in their Introductions; but, among us, attempts of this kind are not always &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful. When long Introductions are formed upon &s;ome common-place topic, as the de&s;ire of happine&s;s being natural to man, or the like, they never fail of being tedious. Variety &s;hould be &s;tudied in this part of compo&s;ition as much as po&s;&s;ible; often it may be proper to begin without any Introduction at all, unle&s;s, perhaps, one or two Sentences. Ex|planatory Introductions from the context, are the mo&s;t &s;imple of any, and frequently the be&s;t that can be u&s;ed: but as they are in hazard of becoming dry, they &s;hould ne|ver
<PB N="375" REF="378">
be long. A Hi&s;torical Introduction has, generally, a happy effect to rouze attenti|on; when one can lay hold upon &s;ome no|ted fact that is connected with the Text or the Di&s;cour&s;e, and, by a proper deduction of it, open the way to the &s;ubject that is to be treated of.</P>
<P>AFTER the Introduction, what com|monly comes next in order, is, the Propo|&s;ition, or Enunciation of the Subject; con|cerning which there is nothing to be &s;aid, but that it &s;hould be as clear and di&s;tinct as po&s;&s;ible, and expre&s;&s;ed in few and plain words, without the lea&s;t affectation. To this, generally &s;ucceeds the Divi&s;ion, or the laying down the method of the Di&s;|cour&s;e; on which it is nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations. I do not mean, that, in every Di&s;cour&s;e, a formal Divi&s;ion, or Di&s;tribution of it into parts, is requi&s;ite. There are many occa&s;ions of Public Speak|ing, when this is neither requi&s;ite, nor would be proper; when the Di&s;cour&s;e, per|haps, is to be &s;hort, or only one point is to be treated of; or when the Speaker does not chu&s;e to warn his hearers of the method he is to follow, or of the conclu&s;ion to which he &s;eeks to bring them. Order of one kind or other is, indeed, e&s;&s;ential to every good Di&s;cour&s;e; that is, every thing &s;hould be &s;o arranged as that what goes before, may give light and force to what follows after. But this may be accompli&s;h|ed
<PB N="376" REF="379">
by means of a concealed method. What we call Divi&s;ion, is, when the method is propounded in form to the hearers.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;e in which this &s;ort of Di|vi&s;ion mo&s;t commonly takes place, is a Ser|mon; and a que&s;tion has been moved, whe|ther this method of laying down heads, as it is called, be the be&s;t method of preach|ing. A very able Judge, the Archbi&s;hop of Cambray, in his Dialogues on Elo|quence, declares &s;trongly again&s;t it. He ob&s;erves, that it is a modern invention; that it was never practi&s;ed by the Fathers of the Church; and, what is certainly true, that it took its ri&s;e from the &s;choolmen, when metaphy&s;ics began to be introduced into preaching. He is of opinion, that it renders a Sermon &s;tiff, that it breaks the unity of the Di&s;cour&s;e; and that, by the natural connection of one part with ano|ther, the attention of the hearers would be carried along the whole with more advan|tage.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding his authority and his arguments, I cannot help being of opinion, that the pre&s;ent method of divid|ing a Sermon into heads, ought not to be laid a&s;ide. E&s;tabli&s;hed practice has now given it &s;o much weight, that, were there nothing more in its favour, it would be dangerous for any Preacher to deviate &s;o far from the common tract. But
<PB N="377" REF="380">
the practice it&s;elf has al&s;o, in my judgment, much rea&s;on on its &s;ide. If formal partiti|ons give a Sermon le&s;s of the oratorial ap|pearance, they render it, however, more clear, more ea&s;ily apprehended, and, of cour&s;e, more in&s;tructive to the bulk of hearers, which is always the main object to be kept in view. The heads of a Sermon are great a&s;&s;i&s;tances to the memory, and re|collection of a hearer. They &s;erve al&s;o to fix his attention. They enable him more ea&s;ily to keep pace with the progre&s;s of the Di&s;cour&s;e; they give him pau&s;es and re&s;t|ing places, where he can reflect on what has been &s;aid, and look forward to what is to follow. They are attended with this ad|vantage too, that they give the audience the opportunity of knowing, before hand, when they are to be relea&s;ed from the fa|tigue of attention, and thereby make them follow the Speaker more patiently: <Q REND="inline">"Refi|cit audientem,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, taking notice of this very advantage of Divi&s;ions in other Di&s;cour&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"Reficit audientem certo &s;ingularium partium fine; non aliter qu&aacute;m facientibus iter, multum detrahunt fati|gationis notata &s;patia in&s;criptis lapidibus; nam et exhau&s;ti laboris n&ocirc;&s;&s;e men&s;uram voluptati e&s;t; et hortatur ad reliqua for|tius exequenda, &s;cire quantum &s;uper&s;it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"The conclu&s;ion of each head is a relief to the hearers; ju&s;t as, upon a journey, the mile-&s;tones, which are &s;et up on the road, &s;erve to dimini&s;h the traveller's fatigue. For we are always plea&s;ed with &s;eeing our labour begin to le&s;&s;en; and, by calculating how much remains, are &s;tirred up to fini&s;h our ta&s;k more cheerfully."</Q></NOTE>."</Q>
<PB N="378" REF="381">
With regard to breaking the Unity of a Di&s;|cour&s;e, I cannot be of opinion that there ari&s;es, from that quarter, any argument again&s;t the method I am de&s;ending. If the Unity be broken, it is to the nature of the heads, or topics of which the Speaker treats, that this is to be imputed; not to his lay|ing them down in form. On the contrary, if his heads be well-cho&s;en, his marking them out, and di&s;tingui&s;hing them, in place of impairing the Unity of the whole, ren|ders it more con&s;picuous and complete; by &s;howing how all the parts of a Di&s;cour&s;e hang upon one another, and tend to one point.</P>
<P>IN a Sermon, or in a Pleading, or any Di&s;cour&s;e, where Divi&s;ion is proper to be u&s;ed, the mo&s;t material rules are,</P>
<P>FIRST, That the &s;everal parts into which the &s;ubject is divided, be really di&s;tinct from one another; that is, that no one include another. It were a very ab&s;urd Divi&s;ion, for in&s;tance, if one &s;hould propo&s;e to treat fir&s;t, of the advantages of Virtue, and next, of tho&s;e of Ju&s;tice or Temperance; becau&s;e, the fir&s;t head evidently comprehends the &s;econd, as a Genus does the Species; which method of proceeding involves the &s;ubject in indi&s;tinctne&s;s and di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="382">
SECONDLY, In Divi&s;ion, we mu&s;t take care to follow the order of nature; begin|ning with the &s;imple&s;t points, &s;uch as are ea&s;ie&s;t apprehended, and nece&s;&s;ary to be fir&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and proceeding thence to tho&s;e which are built upon the former, and which &s;uppo&s;e them to be known. We mu&s;t divide the &s;ubject into tho&s;e parts, in|to which mo&s;t ea&s;ily and naturally it is re|&s;olved; that the &s;ubject may &s;eem to &s;plit it&s;elf, and not to be violently torn a&s;under: <Q REND="inline">"Dividere,"</Q> as is commonly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"non frangere."</Q></P>
<P>THIRDLY, The &s;everal members of a Divi&s;ion ought to exhau&s;t the &s;ubject; otherwi&s;e we do not make a complete Divi|&s;ion; we exhibit the &s;ubject by pieces and corners only, without giving any &s;uch plan as di&s;plays the whole.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, The terms in which our partitions are expre&s;&s;ed, &s;hould be as con|ci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. Avoid all circumlocution here. Admit not a &s;ingle word but what is nece&s;&s;ary. Preci&s;ion is to be &s;tudied, above all things, in laying down a method. It is this which chiefly makes a Divi&s;ion ap|pear neat and elegant; when the &s;everal heads are propounded in the cleare&s;t, mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive, and, at the &s;ame time, the few|e&s;t words po&s;&s;ible. This never fails to &s;trike the hearers agreeably; and is, at the
<PB N="380" REF="383">
&s;ame time, of great con&s;equence towards making the Divi&s;ions be more ea&s;ily remem|bered.</P>
<P>FIFTHLY, Avoid an unnece&s;&s;ary multi|plication of heads. To &s;plit a &s;ubject into a great many minute parts, by Divi&s;ions and Subdivi&s;ions without end, has always a bad effect in &s;peaking. It may be proper in a logical treati&s;e; but it makes an Oration appear hard and dry, and unnece&s;&s;arily fa|tigues the memory. In a Sermon, there may be from three to five, or &s;ix heads, in|cluding Subdivi&s;ions; &s;eldom &s;hould there be more.</P>
<P>IN a Sermon, or in a Pleading at the Bar, few things are of greater con&s;equence, than a proper and happy Divi&s;ion. It &s;hould be &s;tudied with much accuracy and care; for if one take a wrong method at fir&s;t &s;et|ting out, it will lead him a&s;tray in all that follows. It will render the whole Di&s;cour&s;e either perplexed or languid; and though the hearers may not be able to tell where the fault or di&s;order lies, they will be &s;en&s;i|ble there is a di&s;order &s;omewhere, and find them&s;elves little affected by what is &s;poken. The French writers of Sermons &s;tudy neat|ne&s;s and elegance in laying down their heads, much more than the Engli&s;h do; who&s;e di&s;tributions, though &s;en&s;ible and ju&s;t, yet are often inartificial and verbo&s;e. Among the French, however, too much
<PB N="381" REF="384">
quaintne&s;s appears in their Divi&s;ions, with an affectation of always &s;etting out either with two, or with three, general heads of Di&s;cour&s;e. A Divi&s;ion of Ma&s;&s;illon's on this text, <Q REND="inline">"It is fini&s;hed,"</Q> has been much extolled by the French Critics: <Q REND="inline">"This im|ports,"</Q> &s;ays the Preacher, <Q REND="inline">"the con&s;um|mation, fir&s;t, of ju&s;tice on the part of God; &s;econdly, of wickedne&s;s on the part of men; thirdly, of love on the part of Chri&s;t."</Q> This al&s;o of Bourdaloue's has been much prai&s;ed, from the&s;e words." <Q REND="inline">"My peace I give unto you."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Peace,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"fir&s;t, to the under&s;tanding, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to faith; &s;econdly, to the heart, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law."</Q></P>
<P>THE next con&s;tituent part of a Di&s;cour&s;e, which I mentioned, was Narration or Ex|plication. I put the&s;e two together, both becau&s;e they fall nearly under the &s;ame rules, and becau&s;e they commonly an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e; &s;erving to illu&s;trate the cau&s;e, or the &s;ubject of which one treats, before proceeding to argue either on one &s;ide or other; or to make any attempt for intere&s;ting the pa&s;&s;ions of the hearers.</P>
<P>IN Pleadings at the Bar, Narration is of|ten a very important part of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and requires to be particularly attended to. Be&s;ides, its being in any ca&s;e no ea&s;y mat|ter to relate with grace and propriety, there is, in Narrations at the Bar, a peculiar dif|ficulty.
<PB N="382" REF="385">
The Pleader mu&s;t &s;ay nothing but what is true; and, at the &s;ame time, he mu&s;t avoid &s;aying any thing that will hurt his cau&s;e. The facts which he relates, are to be the ground-work of all his future rea&s;oning. To recount them &s;o as to keep &s;trictly within the bounds of truth, and yet to pre&s;ent them under the colours mo&s;t favourable to his cau&s;e; to place, in the mo&s;t &s;triking light, every circum&s;tance which is to his advantage, and to &s;often and weaken &s;uch as make again&s;t him, demands no &s;mall exertion of &s;kill and dexterity. He mu&s;t always re|member, that if he di&s;covers too much art, he defeats his own purpo&s;e, and creates a di&s;tru&s;t of his &s;incerity.

<P>TO be clear and di&s;tinct, to be probable, and to be conci&s;e, are the qualities which
<PB N="383" REF="386">
Critics chiefly require in Narration; each of which carries, &s;ufficiently, the evidence of its importance. Di&s;tinctne&s;s belongs to the whole train of the Di&s;cour&s;e, but is e&s;|pecially requi&s;ite in Narration, which ought to throw light on all that follows. A fact, or a &s;ingle circum&s;tance left in ob|&s;curity, and mi&s;apprehended by the Judge, may de&s;troy the effect of all the argument and rea&s;oning which the Speaker employs. If his Narration be improbable, the Judge will not regard it; and if it be tedious and diffu&s;e, he will tire of it, and forget it. In order to produce di&s;tinctne&s;s, be&s;ides the &s;tudy of the general rules of per&s;picuity which were formerly given, Narration re|quires particular attention to a&s;certain clearly the names, the dates, the places, and every other material circum&s;tance of the facts recounted. In order to be probable in Narration, it is material to enter into the characters of the per&s;ons of whom we &s;peak, and to &s;how, that their actions proceeded from &s;uch motives as are natural, and like|ly to gain belief. In order to be as conci&s;e as the &s;ubject will admit, it is nece&s;&s;ary to throw out all &s;uperfluous circum&s;tances; the rejection of which, will likewi&s;e tend to make our Narration more forcible, and more clear.</P>
<P>CICERO is very remarkable for his talent of Narration; and from the examples in his Orations much may be learned. The Nar|ration,
<PB N="384" REF="387">
for in&s;tance, in the celebrated Ora|tion <HI>pro Milone,</HI> has been often and ju&s;tly admired. His &s;cope is to &s;how, that though in fact Clodius was killed by Milo or his &s;ervants, yet that it was only in &s;elf-de|fence; and that the de&s;ign had been laid, not by Milo again&s;t Clodius, but by Clodius again&s;t Milo's life. All the circum&s;tances for rendering this probable are painted with wonderful art. In relating the manner of Milo's &s;etting out from Rome, he gives the mo&s;t natural de&s;cription of a family excur&s;ion to the country, under which it was impo&s;&s;ible that any bloody de&s;ign could be concealed. <Q REND="inline">"He remained,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"in the Senate-hou&s;e that day, till all the bu&s;ine&s;s was over. He came home, changed his clothes deliberately, and waited for &s;ome time, till his wife had got all her things ready for going with him in his carriage to the country. He did not &s;et out, till &s;uch time as Clodius might ea&s;ily have been in Rome, if he had not been lying in wait for Milo by the way. By and by, Clodius met him on the road, on hor&s;eback, like a man prepared for action, no carriage, not his wife, as was u&s;ual, nor any family equi|page along with him: whil&s;t Milo, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be meditating &s;laughter and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, is travelling in a car|riage with his wife, wrapped up in his cloak, embarra&s;&s;ed with baggage, and attended by a great train of women &s;er|vants,

He does not &s;ay in plain words, that Milo's &s;ervants killed Clodius, but that <Q REND="inline">"in the mid&s;t of the tu|mult, Milo's &s;ervants, without the or|ders, without the knowledge, without the pre&s;ence of their ma&s;ter, did what every ma&s;ter would have wi&s;hed his &s;ervants, in a like conjuncture, to have done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Milo, cum in Senatu fui&s;&s;et eo die, quoad Senatus dimi&s;&s;us e&s;t, domum venit.

IN Sermons, where there is &s;eldom any occa&s;ion for Narration, explication of the &s;ubject to be di&s;cour&s;ed on, comes in the place of narration at the bar, and is to be taken up much on the &s;ame tone; that is, it mu&s;t be conci&s;e, clear, and di&s;tinct; and in a Style correct and elegant, rather than highly adorned.

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXII. CONDUCT OF A DISCOURSE&mdash;THE ARGUMENTATIVE PART&mdash;THE PATHETIC PART&mdash;THE PERO|RATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN treating of the con&s;tituent parts of a regular Di&s;cour&s;e or Oration, I have al|ready con&s;idered the Introduction, the Di|vi&s;ion, and the Narration or Explication. I proceed next to treat of the argumenta|tive or rea&s;oning Part of a Di&s;cour&s;e. In whatever place, or on whatever &s;ubject one &s;peaks, this beyond doubt is of the great|e&s;t con&s;equence. For the great end for which men &s;peak on any &s;erious occa&s;ion, is to convince their hearers of &s;omething being either true, or right, or good; and, by means of this conviction, to influence their practice. Rea&s;on and Argument make the foundation, as I have often in|culcated, of all manly and per&s;ua&s;ive Elo|quence.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="392">
NOW, with re&s;pect to Arguments, three things are requi&s;ite. Fir&s;t, the invention of them; &s;econdly, the proper di&s;po&s;ition and arrangement of them; and thirdly, the expre&s;&s;ing of them in &s;uch a &s;tyle and manner, as to give them their full force.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e, Invention, is, with|out doubt, the mo&s;t material, and the ground-work of the re&s;t. But, with re&s;|pect to this, I am afraid it is beyond the power of art to give any real a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Art cannot go &s;o far, as to &s;upply a Speak|er with arguments on every cau&s;e, and eve|ry &s;ubject; though it may be of con&s;ider|able u&s;e in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to arrange, and ex|pre&s;s tho&s;e, which his knowledge of the &s;ubject has di&s;covered. For it is one thing to di&s;cover the rea&s;ons that are mo&s;t pro|per to convince men, and another, to ma|nage tho&s;e rea&s;ons with mo&s;t advantage. The latter is all that Rhetoric can pre|tend to.</P>
<P>THE ancient Rhetoricians did indeed at|tempt to go much farther than this. They attempted to form Rhetoric into a more complete &s;y&s;tem; and profe&s;&s;ed not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t Public Speakers in &s;etting off their arguments to mo&s;t advantage; but to &s;upply the defect of their invention, and to teach them where to find arguments on every &s;ubject and cau&s;e. Hence their Doctrine of Topics, or <Q REND="inline">"Loci Communes,"</Q>
<PB N="390" REF="393">
and <Q REND="inline">"Sedes Argumentorum,"</Q> which makes &s;o great a figure in the writings of Ari&s;totle, Cicero, and Quinctilian. The&s;e Topics or Loci, were no other than general ideas ap|plicable to a great many different &s;ubjects, which the Orator was directed to con&s;ult, in order to find out materials for his Speech. They had their intrin&s;ic and extrin&s;ic Loci; &s;ome Loci, that were common to all the different kinds of Public Speaking, and &s;ome that were peculiar to each. The com|mon or general Loci, were &s;uch as Genus and Species, Cau&s;e and Effect, Antecedents and Con&s;equents, Likene&s;s and Contrariety, Definition, Circum&s;tances of Time and Place; and a great many more of the &s;ame kind. For each of the different kinds of Public Speaking, they had their <Q REND="inline">"Loci Per&s;onarum,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"Loci Rerum:"</Q> As in demon&s;trative Orations, for in&s;tance, the heads from which any one could be decried or prai&s;ed; his birth, his country, his edu|cation, his kindred, the qualities of his body, the qualities of his mind, the for|tune he enjoyed, the &s;tations he had filled, &amp;c. and in Deliberative Orations, the Topics that might be u&s;ed in recom|mending any public mea&s;ure, or di&s;&s;uad|ing from it; &s;uch as, hone&s;ty, ju&s;tice, facility, profit, plea&s;ure, glory, a&s;&s;i&s;tance from friends, mortification to enemies, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="394">
THE Grecian Sophi&s;ts were the fir&s;t in|ventors of this artificial &s;y&s;tem of Oratory; and they &s;howed a prodigious &s;ubtilty, and fertility in the contrivance of the&s;e Loci. Succeeding Rhetoricians, dazzled by the plan, wrought them up into &s;o regular a &s;y&s;tem, that one would think they meant to teach how a per&s;on might mechanically become an Orator, without any genius at all. They gave him receipts for making Speeches, on all manner of &s;ubjects. At the &s;ame time, it is evident, that though this &s;tudy of common places might produce very &s;howy academical declamations, it could never produce u&s;eful di&s;cour&s;es on real bu&s;ine&s;s. The Loci indeed &s;upplied a mo&s;t exuberant fecundity of matter. One who had no other aim, but to talk co|piou&s;ly and plau&s;ibly, by con&s;ulting them on every &s;ubject, and laying hold of all that they &s;ugge&s;ted, might di&s;cour&s;e with|out end; and that too, though he had none but the mo&s;t &s;uperficial knowledge of his &s;ubject. But &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e, could be no other than trivial. What is truly &s;olid and per&s;ua&s;ive, mu&s;t be drawn <Q REND="inline">"ex vi&s;ceribus cau&s;ae,"</Q> from a thorough knowledge of the &s;ubject, and profound meditation on it. They who would direct &s;tudents of Oratory to any other &s;ources of Argumentation, only delude them; and by attempting to render Rhetoric too perfect an art, they render it, in truth, a trifling and childi&s;h &s;tudy.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="395">
On this doctrine, therefore, of the Rhe|torical Loci or Topics, I think it &s;uperflu|ous to in&s;i&s;t. If any think that the know|ledge of them may contribute to improve their invention, and extend their views, they may con&s;ult Ari&s;totle and Quinctilian, or what Cicero has written on this head, in his Treati&s;e De Inventione, his Topica, and Second Book <HI>De Oratore.</HI> But when they are to prepare a Di&s;cour&s;e, by which they purpo&s;e to convince a Judge, or to produce any con&s;iderable effect upon an A&s;&s;embly, I would advi&s;e them to lay a&s;ide their common places, and to think clo&s;ely of their &s;ubject. Demo&s;thenes, I dare &s;ay, con&s;ulted none of the Loci, when he was inciting the Athenians to take arms again&s;t Philip; and where Cicero has had recour&s;e to them, his Orations are &s;o much the wor&s;e on that account.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to what is of more real u&s;e, to point out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that can be given, not with re&s;pect to the invention, but with re&s;pect to the di&s;po&s;ition, and conduct of Arguments.</P>
<P>TWO different methods may be u&s;ed by Orators in the conduct of their rea&s;on|ing; the terms of art for which are, the Analytic, and the Synthetic method. The Analytic is, when the Orator conceals his in|tention

<PB N="393" REF="396">
concerning the point he is to prove, till he has gradually brought his hearers to the de&s;igned conclu&s;ion. They are led on &s;tep by &s;tep, from one known truth to ano|ther, till the conclu&s;ion be &s;tolen upon them, as the natural con&s;equence of a chain of propo&s;itions. As, for in&s;tance, when one intending to prove the being of a God, &s;ets out with ob&s;erving that every thing which we &s;ee in the world has had a beginning; that whatever has a beginning, mu&s;t have had a prior cau&s;e; that in hu|man productions, art &s;hown in the effect nece&s;&s;arily infers de&s;ign in the cau&s;e; and proceeds leading you on from one cau&s;e to another, till you arrive at one &s;upreme fir&s;t cau&s;e, from whom is derived all the order and de&s;ign vi&s;ible in his works. This is much the &s;ame with the Socratic method, by which that Philo&s;opher &s;ilenced the So|phi&s;ts of his age. It is a very artful me|thod of rea&s;oning; may be carried on with much beauty, and is proper to be u&s;ed when the hearers are much prejudiced again&s;t any truth, and by imperceptible &s;teps mu&s;t be led to conviction.</P>
<P>BUT there are few &s;ubjects that will ad|mit this method, and not many occa&s;ions on which it is proper to be employed. The mode of rea&s;oning mo&s;t generally u&s;ed, and mo&s;t &s;uited to the train of Popular Speak|ing, is what is called the Synthetic; when
<PB N="394" REF="397">
the point to be proved is fairly laid down, and one Argument after another is made to bear upon it, till the hearers be fully con|vinced.</P>
<P>NOW, in allar guing, one of the fir&s;t things to be attended to is, among the va|rious Arguments which may occur upon a cau&s;e, to make a proper &s;election of &s;uch as appear to one's &s;elf the mo&s;t &s;olid; and to employ the&s;e as the chief means of per&s;ua|&s;ion. Every Speaker &s;hould place him&s;elf in the &s;ituation of a hearer. and think how he would be affected by tho&s;e rea&s;ons, which he purpo&s;es to employ for per&s;uading others. For he mu&s;t not expect to impo&s;e on man|kind by mere arts of Speech. They are not &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on, as Public Speakers are &s;ometimes apt to think. Shrewdne&s;s and &s;agacity are found among all ranks; and the Speaker may be prai&s;ed for his fine Di&s;|cour&s;e, while yet the hearers are not per|&s;uaded of the truth of any one thing he has uttered.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING the Arguments properly cho&s;en, it is evident that their effect will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depend on the right arrange|ment of them; &s;o as they &s;hall not ju&s;tle and embarra&s;s one another, but give mutual aid; and bear with the faire&s;t and fulle&s;t di|rection on the point in view. Concerning this, the following rules may be taken:</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="398">
IN the fir&s;t place, avoid blending Argu|ments confu&s;edly together, that are of a &s;e|parate nature. All Arguments whatever are directed to prove one or other of the&s;e three things; that &s;omething is true; that it is morally right or fit; or that it is pro|fitable and good. The&s;e make the three great &s;ubjects of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion among mankind; Truth, Duty, and Intere&s;t. But the Argu|ments directed towards either of them are generically di&s;tinct; and he who blends them all under one Topic, which he calls his Argument, as, in Sermons, e&s;pecially, is too often done, will render his rea&s;oning indi&s;tinct, and inelegant. Suppo&s;e, for in|&s;tance, that I am recommending to an Au|dience Benevolence, or the Love of our Neighbour; and that I take my fir&s;t Argu|ment, from the inward &s;atisfaction which a benevolent temper affords; my &s;econd, from the obligation which the example of Chri&s;t lays upon us to this duty; and my third, from its tendency to procure us the good|will of all around us; my arguments are good, but I have arranged them wrong: for my fir&s;t and third Arguments are taken from con&s;iderations of intere&s;t, internal peace, and external advantages; and between the&s;e, I have introduced one, which re&s;ts wholly upon duty. I &s;hould have kept tho&s;e cla&s;s|es of Arguments, which are addre&s;&s;ed to different principles in human nature, &s;e|parate and di&s;tinct.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="399">
IN the &s;econd place, With regard to the different degrees of &s;trength in Arguments, the general rule is, to advance in the way of climax, <Q REND="inline">"ut augeatur &s;emper, et incre&s;cat oratio."</Q> This e&s;pecially is to be the cour&s;e, when the Speaker has a clear cau&s;e, and is confident that he can prove it fully. He may then adventure to begin with feebler arguments; ri&s;ing gradually, and not put|ting forth his whole &s;trength till the la&s;t, when he can tru&s;t to his making a &s;ucce&s;s|ful impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of hearers, prepared by what has gone before. But this rule is not to be always followed. For, if he di&s;tru&s;ts his cau&s;e, and has but one material Argument on which to lay the &s;tre&s;s, putting le&s;s confidence in the re&s;t, in this ca&s;e, it is often proper for him to place this material Argument in the front; to preoccupy the hearers early, and make the &s;tronge&s;t effort at fir&s;t; that, having re|moved prejudices, and di&s;po&s;ed them to be favourable, the re&s;t of his rea&s;oning may be li&s;tened to with more docility. When it happens, that amid&s;t a variety of Argu|ments, there are one or two which we are &s;en&s;ible are more inconclu&s;ive than the re&s;t, and yet proper to be u&s;ed, Cicero advi&s;es to place the&s;e in the middle, as a &s;tation le&s;s con&s;picuous than either the beginning, or the end, of the train of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="400">
IN the third place, When our Arguments are &s;trong and &s;atisfactory, the more they are di&s;tingui&s;hed and treated apart from each other, the better. Each can then bear to be brought out by it&s;elf, placed in its full light, amplified and re&s;ted upon. But when our Arguments are doubtful, and only of the pre&s;umptive kind, it is &s;afer to throw them together in a crowd, and to run them into one another: <Q REND="inline">"ut quae &s;unt na|tura imbecilla,"</Q> as Quinctilian &s;peaks, <Q REND="inline">"mutuo auxilio &s;u&s;tineantur;"</Q> that though infirm of them&s;elves, they may &s;erve mu|tually to prop each other. He gives a good example, in the ca&s;e of one who was ac|cu&s;ed of murdering a relation, to whom he was heir. Direct proof was wanting; but, <Q REND="inline">"you expected a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and a great &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; you was in di&s;tre&s;t circum|&s;tances; you was pu&s;hed to the utmo&s;t by your creditors; you had offended your relation, who had made you his heir; you knew that he was ju&s;t then intend|ing to alter his will; no time was to be lo&s;t. Each of the&s;e particulars, by it&s;elf,"</Q> &s;ays the Author, <Q REND="inline">"is inconclu&s;ive; but when they were a&s;&s;embled in one groupe, they have effect."</Q></P>
<P>OF the di&s;tinct Amplification of one per|&s;ua&s;ive Argument, we have a mo&s;t beautiful example, in Cicero's Oration for Milo. The Argument is taken, from a circum&s;tance of time. Milo was candidate for the Con&s;ul|&s;hip;
<PB N="398" REF="401">
and Clodius was killed a few days be|fore the election. He a&s;ks, if any one could believe that Milo would be mad enough, at &s;uch a critical time, by a mo&s;t odious a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination, to alienate from him&s;elf the favour of the people, who&s;e &s;uffrages he was &s;o anxiou&s;ly courting? This Argument, the moment it is &s;ugge&s;ted, appears to have con|&s;iderable weight. But it was not enough, &s;imply to &s;ugge&s;t it; it could bear to be dwelt upon, and brought out into full light. The Orator, therefore, draws a ju&s;t and &s;triking picture of that &s;olicitous attention with which candidates, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, always found it nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate the good opinion of the people. <Q REND="inline">"Quo tem|pore,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"(Scio enim quam timi|da &s;it ambitio, quantaque et quam &s;ollici|ta, cupiditas con&s;ulat&ucirc;s) omnia, non mo|do quae reprehendi palam, &s;ed etiam quae ob&s;cure cogitari po&s;&s;unt, timemus. Ru|morem, fabulam fictam et fal&s;am, per|horre&s;cimus; ora omnium atque oculos intuemur.

<P>IN the fourth place, again&s;t extending Arguments too far, and multiplying them too much. This &s;erves rather to render a cau&s;e &s;u&s;pected, than to give it weight. An unnece&s;&s;ary multiplicity of Arguments, both burdens the memory, and detracts from the weight of that conviction, which a few well cho&s;en Arguments carry. It is to be ob&s;erv|ed too, that in the Amplification of Argu|ments, a diffu&s;e and &s;preading method, be|yond the bounds of rea&s;onable illu&s;tration, is always enfeebling. It takes off greatly from that <Q REND="inline">"vis et acumen,"</Q> which &s;hould be the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the Argu|mentative Part of a Di&s;cour&s;e. When a
<PB N="400" REF="403">
Speaker dwells long on a favourite Argu|ment, and &s;eeks to turn it into every po&s;|&s;ible light, it almo&s;t always happens, that, fatigued with the effort, he lo&s;es the &s;pirit with which he &s;et out; and concludes with feeblene&s;s, what he began with force. There is a proper temperance in rea&s;oning, as there is in other parts of a Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER due attention given to the proper arrangement of Arguments, what is next re|qui&s;ite for their &s;ucce&s;s, is to expre&s;s them in &s;uch a &s;tyle, and to deliver them in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hall give them full force. On the&s;e heads I mu&s;t refer the Reader to the directions I have given in treating of Style, in former Lectures; and to the directions I am afterwards to give concerning Pronun|ciation and Delivery.</P>
<P>I PROCEED, therefore, next, to another e&s;&s;ential part of Di&s;cour&s;e which I mention|ed as the fifth in order, that is, the Pathe|tic; in which, if any where, Eloquence reigns, and exerts its power. I &s;hall not, in beginning this head, take up time in combating the &s;cruples of tho&s;e who have moved a que&s;tion, whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with firmne&s;s and candor in a Public Speak|er, to addre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions of his Audience? This is a que&s;tion about words alone, and which common &s;en&s;e ea&s;ily determines. In enquiries after mere truth, in matters of &s;im|ple information and in&s;truction, there is no
<PB N="401" REF="404">
que&s;tion that the pa&s;&s;ions have no concern, and that all attempts to move them are ab|&s;urd. Wherever conviction is the object, it is the under&s;tanding alone that is to be ap|plied to. It is by argument and rea&s;oning, that one man attempts to &s;atisfy another of what is true, or right, or ju&s;t; but if per|&s;ua&s;ion be the object, the ca&s;e is changed. In all that relates to practice, there is no man who &s;eriou&s;ly means to per&s;uade ano|ther, but addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to his pa&s;&s;ions more or le&s;s; for this plain rea&s;on, that pa&s;|&s;ions are the great &s;prings of human action. The mo&s;t virtuous man, in treating of the mo&s;t virtuous &s;ubject, &s;eeks to touch the heart of him to whom he &s;peaks; and makes no &s;cruple to rai&s;e his indignation at inju&s;|tice, or his pity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, though pity and indignation be pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN treating of this part of Eloquence, the ancients made the &s;ame &s;ort of attempt as they employed with re&s;pect to the argumen|tative part, in order to bring Rhetoric into a more perfect &s;y&s;tem. They enquired metaphy&s;ically into the nature of every pa&s;&s;ion; they gave a definition, and a de|&s;cription of it; they treated of its cau&s;es, its effects, and its concomitants; and thence deduced rules for working upon it. Ari|&s;totle in particular has, in his Treati&s;e upon Rhetoric, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the nature of the pa&s;|&s;ions with much profoundne&s;s and &s;ubtilty; and what he has written on that head, may
<PB N="402" REF="405">
be read with no &s;mall profit, as a valuable piece of Moral Philo&s;ophy; but whether it will have any effect in rendering an Orator more pathetic, is to me doubtful. It is not, I am afraid, any philo&s;ophical knowledge of the pa&s;&s;ions, that can confer this talent. We mu&s;t be indebted for it to Nature, to a certain &s;trong and happy &s;en&s;ibility of mind; and one may be a mo&s;t thorough adept in all the &s;peculative knowledge that can be acquired concerning the pa&s;&s;ions, and re|main at the &s;ame time a cold and dry Speak|er. The u&s;e of rules and in&s;tructions on this, or any other part of Oratory, is not to &s;upply the want of genius, but to direct it where it is found, into its proper chan|nel; to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in exerting it&s;elf with mo&s;t advantage, and to prevent the errors and extravagancies into which it is &s;ometimes apt to run. On the head of the Pathetic, the following directions appear to me to be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is to con&s;ider carefully, whe|ther the &s;ubject admit the Pathetic, and ren|der it proper; and if it does, what part of the Di&s;cour&s;e is the mo&s;t proper for attempt|ing it. To determine the&s;e points belongs to good &s;en&s;e; for it is evident, that there are many &s;ubjects which admit not the Pa|thetic at all, and that even in tho&s;e that are &s;u&s;ceptible of it, an attempt to excite the pa&s;&s;ions in the wrong place, may expo&s;e an Orator to ridicule. All that can be &s;aid in
<PB N="403" REF="406">
general is, that if we expect any emotion which we rai&s;e to have a la&s;ting effect, we mu&s;t be careful to bring over to our &s;ide, in the fir&s;t place, the under&s;tanding and judgment. The hearers mu&s;t be convinced that there are good and &s;ufficient grounds, for their entering with warmth into the cau&s;e. They mu&s;t be able to ju&s;tify to them&s;elves the pa&s;&s;ion which they feel; and remain &s;atisfied that they are not carried away by mere delu&s;ion. Unle&s;s their minds be brought into this &s;tate, although they may have been heated by the Orator's di&s;|cour&s;e, yet, as &s;oon as he cea&s;es to &s;peak, they will re&s;ume their ordinary tone of thought; and the emotion which he has rai&s;ed will die entirely away. Hence mo&s;t writers a&s;&s;ign the Pathetic to the Peroration or Conclu&s;ion, as its natural place; and, no doubt, all other things being equal, this is the impre&s;&s;ion that one would chu&s;e to make la&s;t, leaving the minds of the hearers warmed with the &s;ubject, after argument and rea&s;oning had produced their full ef|fect: but wherever it is introduced, I mu&s;t advi&s;e,</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, never to &s;et apart a head of di&s;cour&s;e in form, for rai&s;ing any pa&s;&s;ion; never give warning that you are about to be pathetic; and call upon your hearers, as is &s;ometimes done, to follow you in the attempt. This almo&s;t never fails to prove a refrigerant to pa&s;&s;ion. It puts the
<PB N="404" REF="407">
hearers immediately on their guard, and di&s;|po&s;es them for criticizing, much more than for being moved. The indirect method of making an impre&s;&s;ion is likely to be more &s;ucce&s;sful; when you &s;eize the critical mo|ment that is favourable to emotion, in what|ever part of the di&s;cour&s;e it occurs; and then, after due preparation, throw in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and pre&s;ent &s;uch glowing images, as may kindle their pa&s;&s;ions before they are aware. This can often be done more happily, in a few &s;entences in&s;pired by natural warmth, than in a long and &s;tudied Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the third place, It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, that there is a great difference be|tween &s;howing the hearers that they ought to be moved, and actually moving them. This di&s;tinction is not &s;ufficiently attended to, e&s;pecially by Preachers, who, if they have a head in their Sermon to &s;how how much we are bound to be grateful to God, or to be compa&s;&s;ionate to the di&s;tre&s;t, are apt to imagine this to be a pathetic part. Now, all the Arguments you produce to &s;how me, why it is my duty, why it is rea|&s;onable and fit, that I &s;hould be moved in a certain way, go no further than to di&s;|po&s;e or prepare me for entering into &s;uch an emotion; but they do not actually excite it. To every emotion or pa&s;&s;ion, Nature has adapted a &s;et of corre&s;ponding objects; and, without &s;etting the&s;e before the mind,
<PB N="405" REF="408">
it is not in the power of any Orator to rai&s;e that emotion. I am warmed with grati|tude, I am touched with compa&s;&s;ion, not when a Speaker &s;hows me that the&s;e are noble di&s;po&s;itions, and that it is my duty to feel them; or when he exclaims again&s;t me for my indifference and coldne&s;s. All this time, he is &s;peaking only to my rea&s;on or con&s;cience. He mu&s;t de&s;cribe the kind|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s of my friend; he mu&s;t &s;et before me the di&s;tre&s;s &s;uffered by the per&s;on for whom he would intere&s;t me; then, and not till then, my heart begins to be touched, my gratitude or my compa&s;&s;ion begin to flow. The foundation, therefore, of all &s;ucce&s;sful execution in the way of Pathetic Oratory is, to paint the object of that pa&s;&s;ion which we wi&s;h to rai&s;e, in the mo&s;t natural and &s;triking manner; to de|&s;cribe it with &s;uch circum&s;tances as are likely to awaken it in the minds of others. Every pa&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t &s;trongly excited by &s;en&s;ation; as anger, by the feeling of an injury, or the pre&s;ence of the injurer. Next to the influence of Sen&s;e, is that of Me|mory; and next to Memory is, the influ|ence of the Imagination. Of this power, therefore, the Orator mu&s;t avail him&s;elf, &s;o as to &s;trike the imagination of the hearers with circum&s;tances which, in lu&s;tre and &s;teadine&s;s, re&s;emble tho&s;e of Sen&s;ation and Remembrance. In order to accompli&s;h this,</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="409">
IN the fourth place, the only effectual method is, to be moved your&s;elves. There are a thou&s;and intere&s;ting circum&s;tances &s;ugge&s;ted by real pa&s;&s;ion, which no art can imitate, and no refinement can &s;upply. There is obviou&s;ly a contagion among the pa&s;&s;ions.
<Q><L>Ut ridentibus arrident, &s;ic fluentibus adflent,</L>
<L>Humani vultus.</L></Q>
The internal emotion of the Speaker adds a pathos to his words, his looks, his ge&s;tures, and his whole manner, which exerts a pow|er almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible over tho&s;e who hear him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Quid enim aliud e&s;t cau&s;ae ut lugentas, in recenti do|lore, di&s;erti&s;&s;ime quaedam exclamare videantur; et ira non|nunquam in indoctis quoque eloquentiam faciat; quam quod illis ine&s;t vis mentis, et veritas ip&s;a Morum? quare in iis quae veri&s;imilia e&s;&s;e volumus, &s;imus ip&s;i &s;imiles eorum qui vere patiuntur, affectibus; et a tali animo profici&s;catur oratio qualem facere judicem volet.&mdash;Afficiamur antequam afficere conemur." <BIBL>QUINCT. Lib. 6.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. But on this point, though the mo&s;t material of all, I &s;hall not now in&s;i&s;t, as I have often had occa&s;ion before to &s;how, that all attempts towards becoming Pathetic, when we are not moved our&s;elves, expo&s;e us to certain ridicule.</P>
<P>QUINCTILIAN, who di&s;cour&s;es upon this &s;ubject with much good &s;en&s;e, takes pains to inform us of the method which he u&s;ed, when he was a Public Speaker, for entering into tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which he want|ed
<PB N="407" REF="410">
to excite in others; &s;etting before his own imagination what he calls, <Q REND="inline">"Phanta|&s;iae"</Q> or <Q REND="inline">"Vi&s;iones,"</Q> &s;trong pictures of the di&s;tre&s;s or indignities which they had &s;uffered, who&s;e cau&s;e he was to plead, and for whom he was to intere&s;t his hearers; dwelling upon the&s;e, and putting him&s;elf in their &s;ituation, till he was affected by a pa&s;&s;ion &s;imilar to that which the per&s;ons them&s;elves had felt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Ut hominem occi&s;um querar; non omnia quae in re pre|&s;enti accidi&s;&s;e credibile e&s;t, in occulis habebo? Non-percu&s;|&s;or ille &s;ubitus erumpet? non expare&s;cet circumventus? ex|clamabit, vel rogabit, vel fugiet? non ferientem, non conci|dentem videbo? non animo &s;anguis, et pallor, et gemitus, extremus denique expirantis hiatus, in&s;idet?&mdash;Ubi vero mi&s;eratione opus erit, nobis ea de quibus querimur ac|cidi&s;&s;e credamus, atque id animo no&s;tro per&s;uadea|mus. Nos illi &s;imus, quos gravia, indigna, tri&s;tia, pa&s;&s;os queramur. Nec agamus rem qua&s;i alienam; &s;ed a&s;&s;umamus parumper illum dolorem. Ita dicemus quae in &s;imili no&s;tro ca&s;u dicturi e&s;&s;emus." <BIBL>Lib. 6.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. To this method he attributes all the &s;ucce&s;s he ever had in Public Speaking; and there can be no doubt, that whatever tends to increa&s;e an Orator's &s;en&s;ibility, will add greatly to his Pathetic Powers.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, It is nece&s;&s;ary to at|tend to the proper language of the pa&s;&s;ions. We &s;hould ob&s;erve in what manner any one expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf who is under the power of a real and a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion; and we &s;hall always find his Language unaffected and &s;imple. It may be animated, indeed, with bold and &s;trong figures, but it will have no
<PB N="408" REF="411">
ornament or finery. He is not at lei&s;ure to follow out the play of Imagination. His mind being wholly &s;eized by one object which has heated it, he has no other aim, but to repre&s;ent that, in all its circum&s;tan|ces, as &s;trongly as he feels it. This mu&s;t be the Style of the Orator, when he would be pathetic; and this will be his Style, if he &s;peaks from real feeling; bold, ardent, &s;imple. No &s;ort of de&s;cription will then &s;ucceed, but what is written <Q REND="inline">"fervente calamo."</Q> If he &s;tay till he can work up his Style, and poli&s;h and adorn it, he will infallibly cool his own ardor; and then he will touch the heart no more. His compo|&s;ition will become frigid; it will be the Language of one who de&s;cribes, but who does not feel. We mu&s;t take notice, that there is a great difference between painting to the imagination, and painting to the heart. The one may be done coolly, and at lei&s;ure: the other, mu&s;t always be rapid and ardent. In the former, art and labour may be &s;uffered to appear; in the latter, no effect can follow, unle&s;s it &s;eem to be the work of nature only.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ixth place, Avoid interweaving anything of a foreign nature with the pathe|tic part of a Di&s;cour&s;e. Beware of all digre&s;|&s;ions, which may interrupt or turn a&s;ide the natural cour&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion, when once it begins to ri&s;e and &s;well. Sacrifice all beau|ties, however bright and &s;howy, which would divert the mind from the principal
<PB N="409" REF="412">
object, and which would amu&s;e the imagi|nation, rather than touch the heart. Hence compari&s;ons are always dangerous, and generally quite improper, in the mid&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion. Beware even of rea&s;oning un|&s;ea&s;onably; or, at lea&s;t, of carrying on a long and &s;ubtile train of rea&s;oning, on occa&s;ions when the principal aim is to excite warm emotions.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, Never attempt prolong|ing the Pathetic too much. Warm emoti|ons are too violent to be la&s;ting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Nunquam debet e&s;&s;e longa mi&s;eratio; nam cum veros dolores mitiget tempus, citius evane&s;cat, nece&s;&s;e e&s;t illa, quam dicendo effinximus, imago: in qua, &s;i moramur, lacrymis fatigatur auditor, et requie&s;cit, et ab illo quem ceperat im|petu, in rationem redit. Non patiamur igitur frige&s;cere hoc opus; et affectum, cum ad &s;ummum perduxerimus, relin|quamus; nec &s;peremus fore, ut aliena mala qui&s;quam diu ploret." <BIBL>QUINCT. L. 6.</BIBL></Q> </NOTE>. Study the proper time of making a retreat; of making a tran&s;ition from the pa&s;&s;ionate to the calm tone; in &s;uch a manner, however, as to de&s;cend without falling, by keeping up the &s;ame &s;train of Sentiment that was carried on before, though now expre&s;&s;ing it with more moderation. Above all things, be|ware of &s;training pa&s;&s;ion too far; of attempt|ing to rai&s;e it to unnatural heights. Pre|&s;erve always a due regard to what the hear|ers will bear; and remember, that he who &s;tops not at the proper point; who attempts to carry them farther, in pa&s;&s;ion, than they will follow him, de&s;troys his whole de&s;ign.
<PB N="410" REF="413">
By endeavouring to warm them too much, he takes the mo&s;t effectual method of freez|ing them completely.</P>
<P>HAVING given the&s;e rules concerning the Pathetic, I &s;hall give one example from Ci|cero, which will &s;erve to illu&s;trate &s;everal of them, particularly the la&s;t. It &s;hall be taken from his la&s;t Oration again&s;t Verres, wherein he de&s;cribes the cruelty exerci&s;ed by Verres, when Governor of Sicily, again&s;t one Gavius, a Roman citizen. This Gavi|us had made his e&s;cape from pri&s;on, into which he had been thrown by the Go|vernor; and when ju&s;t embarking at Me&s;|&s;ina, thinking him&s;elf now &s;afe, had utter|ed &s;ome threats, that when he had once ar|rived at Rome, Verres &s;hould hear of him, and be brought to account for having put a Roman citizen in chains. The Chief Magi&s;trate of Me&s;&s;ina, a creature of Ver|res's, in&s;tantly apprehends him, and gives information of his threatnings. The be|haviour of Verres, on this oca&s;ion, is de|&s;cribed in the mo&s;t picture&s;que manner, and with all the colours which were proper, in order to excite again&s;t him the public indig|nation. He thanks the Magi&s;trate of Me&s;|&s;ina for his diligence. Filled with rage, he comes into the Forum; orders Gavius to be brought forth, the executioners to attend, and again&s;t the laws, and contrary to the well-known privileges of a Roman citizen, commands him to be &s;tripped naked, bound,
<PB N="411" REF="414">
and &s;courged publicly in a cruel manner. Cicero then proceeds thus; <Q REND="inline">"Caedebatur virgis, in medio foro Me&s;&s;anae, civis Ro|manus, Judices!"</Q> every word ri&s;es above another in de&s;cribing this flagrant enormi|ty; and, <Q REND="inline">"Judices,"</Q> is brought out at the end with the greate&s;t propriety: <Q REND="inline">"Caedeba|tur virgis, in medio foro Me&s;&s;anae, civis Romanus, Judices! cum interea, nullus gemitus, nulla vox alia i&s;tius mi&s;eri, inter dolorem crepitumque plagarum audieba|tur, ni&s;i haec, Civis Romanus &s;um.

By pleading this privilege of his birthright, he hoped to have &s;topped the &s;trokes of the executioner.

<P><PB N="412" REF="415">
NOTHING can be finer, nor better con|ducted than this pa&s;&s;age. The circum|&s;tances are well cho&s;en for exciting both the compa&s;&s;ion of his hearers for Gavius, and their indignation again&s;t Verres. The &s;tyle is &s;imple; and the pa&s;&s;ionate Excla|mation, the Addre&s;s to Liberty and the Laws, is well-timed, and in the proper Style of Pa&s;&s;ion. The Orator goes on to exaggerate Verres's cruelty &s;till farther, by another very &s;triking circum&s;tance. He or|dered a gibbet to be erected for Gavius, not in the common place of execution, but ju&s;t by the &s;ea-&s;hore, over again&s;t the coa&s;t of Italy. <Q REND="inline">"Let him,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"who boa&s;ts &s;o much of his being a Roman citizen, take a view from his gibbet of his own country.&mdash;This ba&s;e in&s;ult over a dying man is the lea&s;t part of his guilt.

<P>HITHERTO all is beautiful, animated, pathetic; and the model would have been perfect, if Cicero had &s;topped at this point. But his redundant and florid genius carried him further. He mu&s;t needs intere&s;t, not his hearers only, but the bea&s;ts, the moun|tains, and the &s;tones, again&s;t Verres: <Q REND="inline">"Si haec non ad cives Romanos, non ad ami|cos no&s;trae civitatis, non ad eos qui populi Romani nomen audi&s;&s;ent; denique &s;i non ad homines, verum ad be&s;tias; atque ut longius progrediar, &s;i in aliqua de&s;erti&s;&s;ima &s;olitudine, ad &s;axa et ad &s;copulos, haec conqueri et de|plorare vellem, tamen omnia muta atque inanima, tant&acirc; et tam indign&acirc; rerum atrocitate commoverentur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Were I employed in lamenting tho&s;e in&s;tances of an atrocious oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, not among an a&s;&s;embly of Roman citizens, not among the allies of our &s;tate, not among tho&s;e who had ever heard the name of the Roman peo|ple, not even among human creatures, but in the mid&s;t of the brute creation; and to go farther, were I pouring forth my lamentations to the &s;tones, and to the rocks, in &s;ome remote and de&s;ert wilderne&s;s, even tho&s;e mute and inanimate beings would, at the recital of &s;uch &s;hocking indignities, be thrown into commotion."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> This, with all the deference due to &s;o eloquent an Ora|tor, we mu&s;t pronounce to be Declamatory, not Pathetic.

Sometimes, the whole pathetic part comes in mo&s;t properly at the Peroration. Sometimes, when the Di&s;|cour&s;e has been entirely argumentative, it is fit to conclude with &s;umming up the Arguments, placing them in one view, and leaving the impre&s;&s;ion of them, full and &s;trong, on the mind of the Audience. For the great rule of a Conclu&s;ion, and what nature obviou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ts, is, to place that la&s;t on which we choo&s;e that the &s;trength of our cau&s;e &s;hould re&s;t.</P>

They appear, in this ca&s;e, like excre&s;cences jutting out from the body, which had bet|ter have been wanted; and tend to enfee|ble the impre&s;&s;ion, which the Compo&s;ition, as a whole, is calculated to make.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t eloquent of the French, per|haps, indeed, of all modern Orators, Bou&s;|&s;uet, Bi&s;hop of Meaux, terminates in a very moving manner, his funeral Oration on the great Prince of Cond&eacute;, with this return up|on him&s;elf, and his old age: <Q REND="inline">"Accept, O Prince! the&s;e la&s;t efforts of a voice which you once well knew.

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXIII. PRONUNCIATION, OR DELIVERY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated of &s;everal general heads relating to Eloquence, or Pub|lic Speaking, I now proceed to another ve|ry important part of the &s;ubject yet remain|ing, that is, Pronunciation, or Delivery of a Di&s;cour&s;e. How much &s;tre&s;s was laid upon this by the mo&s;t eloquent of all Ora|tors, Demo&s;thenes, appears from a noted &s;aying of his, related both by Cicero and Quinctilian; when being a&s;ked, What was the fir&s;t point in Oratory? he an&s;wered, Delivery; and being a&s;ked, What was the &s;econd? and afterwards, What was the third? he &s;till an&s;wered, Delivery. There is no wonder, that he &s;hould have rated this &s;o high, and that for improving him|&s;elf in it, he &s;hould have employed tho&s;e a&s;&s;iduous and painful labours, which all the antients take &s;o much notice of; for, be|yond doubt, nothing is of more importance.
<PB N="418" REF="421">
To &s;uperficial thinkers, the management of the voice and ge&s;ture, in Public Speaking, may appear to relate to Decoration only, and to be one of the inferior arts of catching an Audience. But this is far from being the ca&s;e. It is intimately connected with what is, or ought to be, the end of all Pub|lic Speaking, Per&s;ua&s;ion; and therefore de|&s;erves the &s;tudy of the mo&s;t grave and &s;e|rious Speakers, as much as of tho&s;e, who&s;e only aim it is to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR, let it be con&s;idered, whenever we addre&s;s our&s;elves to others by words, our intention certainly is to make &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ion on tho&s;e to whom we &s;peak; it is to convey to them our own ideas and emoti|ons. Now the tone of our voice, our looks, and ge&s;tures, interpret our ideas and emoti|ons no le&s;s than words do; nay, the im|pre&s;&s;ion they make on others, is frequently much &s;tronger than any that words can make. We often &s;ee that an expre&s;&s;ive look, or a pa&s;&s;ionate cry, unaccompanied by words, convey to others more forcible ideas, and rou&s;e within them &s;tronger pa&s;|&s;ions, than can be communicated by the mo&s;t eloquent Di&s;cour&s;e. The &s;ignification of our &s;entiments, made by tones and ge&s;|tures, has this advantage above that made by words, that it is the Language of nature. It is that method of interpreting our mind, which nature has dictated to all, and which is under&s;tood by all; whereas, words are
<PB N="419" REF="422">
only arbitrary, conventional &s;ymbols of our ideas; and, by con&s;equence, mu&s;t make a more feeble impre&s;&s;ion. So true is this, that, to render words fully &s;ignificant, they mu&s;t, almo&s;t in every ca&s;e, receive &s;ome aid from the manner of Pronunciation and De|livery; and he who, in &s;peaking, &s;hould employ bare words, without enforcing them by proper tones and accents, would leave us with a faint and indi&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion, often with a doubtful and ambiguous con|ception, of what he had delivered. Nay, &s;o clo&s;e is the connection between certain &s;en|timents and the proper manner of pronounc|ing them, that he who does not pronounce them after that manner, can never per&s;uade us, that he believes, or feels, the &s;enti|ments them&s;elves. His Delivery may be &s;uch, as to give the lie to all that he a&s;&s;erts. When Marcus Callidius accu&s;ed one of an attempt to poi&s;on him, but enforced his ac|cu&s;ation in a languid manner, and without any warmth or earne&s;tne&s;s of Delivery, Ci|cero, who pleaded for the accu&s;ed per&s;on, improved this into an argument of the fal|&s;ity of the charge, <Q REND="inline">"An tu, M. Callidi ni&s;i fingeres, &s;ic ageres?"</Q> In Shake&s;peare's Richard II. the Duche&s;s of York thus im|peaches the &s;incerity of her hu&s;band:
<Q><L>Pleads he in earne&s;t?&mdash;Look upon his face,</L>
<L>His eyes do drop no tears; his prayers are je&s;t;</L>
<L>His words come from his mouth; ours, from our brea&s;t;</L>
<L>He prays but faintly, and would be denied;</L>
<L>We pray with heart and &s;oul.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="423">
BUT, I believe it is needle&s;s to &s;ay any more, in order to &s;how the high importance of a good Delivery. I proceed, therefore, to &s;uch ob&s;ervations as appear to me mo&s;t u&s;eful to be made on this head.</P>
<P>THE great objects which every Public Speaker will naturally have in his eye in for|ming his Delivery, are, fir&s;t, to &s;peak &s;o as to be fully and ea&s;ily under&s;tood by all who hear him; and next, to &s;peak with grace and force, &s;o as to plea&s;e and to move his Audience. Let us con&s;ider what is mo&s;t important with re&s;pect to each of the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this whole &s;ubject, Mr. Sheridan's Lectures on Elo|cution, are very worthy of being con&s;ulted; and &s;everal hints are here taken from them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to be fully and ea&s;ily under|&s;tood, the four chief requi&s;ites are a due degree of Loudne&s;s of Voice; Di&s;tinctne&s;s; Slowne&s;s; and Propriety of Pronunciation.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t attention of every Public Speaker, doubtle&s;s, mu&s;t be, to make him|&s;elf be heard by all tho&s;e to whom he &s;peaks. He mu&s;t endeavour to fill with his voice, the &s;pace occupied by the A&s;&s;embly. This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a natural talent. It is &s;o in a good mea&s;ure; but, however, may receive con|&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art. Much de|pends for this purpo&s;e on the proper pitch, and management of the voice. Every man
<PB N="421" REF="424">
has three pitches in his voice; the High, the Middle, and the Low one. The High, is that which he u&s;es in calling aloud to &s;ome one at a di&s;tance. The Low is, when he approaches to a whi&s;per. The Middle is, that which he employs in common conver|&s;ation, and which he &s;hould u&s;e for ordi|nary in public Di&s;cour&s;e. For it is a great mi&s;take, to imagine that one mu&s;t take the highe&s;t pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard by a great A&s;&s;embly. This is confounding two things which are differ|ent, Loudne&s;s, or Strength of Sound, with the key, or note on which we &s;peak. A Speaker may render his voice louder, with|out altering the key; and we will always be able to give mo&s;t body, mo&s;t per&s;evering force of &s;ound, to that pitch of voice, to which in conver&s;ation we are accu&s;tomed. Whereas, by &s;etting out on our highe&s;t pitch or key, we certainly allow our&s;elves le&s;s compa&s;s, and are likely to &s;train and outrun our voice before we have done. We &s;hall fatigue our&s;elves, and &s;peak with pain; and whenever a man &s;peaks with pain to him&s;elf, he is always heard with pain by his Audience. Give the voice there|fore full &s;trength and &s;well of &s;ound: but always pitch it on your ordinary &s;peaking key. Make it a con&s;tant rule never to ut|ter a greater quantity of voice, than you can afford without pain to your&s;elves, and without any extraordinary effort. As long
<PB N="422" REF="425">
as you keep within the&s;e bounds, the other organs of &s;peech will be at liberty to di&s;|charge their &s;everal offices with ea&s;e; and you will always have your voice under command. But whenever you tran&s;gre&s;s the&s;e bounds, you give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is an u&s;eful rule too, in order to be well heard, to fix our eye on &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tant per&s;ons in the A&s;&s;embly, and to con|&s;ider our&s;elves as &s;peaking to them. We naturally and mechanically utter our words with &s;uch a degree of &s;trength, as to make our&s;elves be heard by one to whom we addre&s;s our&s;elves, provided he be within the reach of our voice. As this is the ca&s;e in common conver&s;ation, it will hold al&s;o in Public Speaking. But remember, that in public as well as in conver&s;ation, it is po&s;&s;ible to offend by &s;peaking too loud. This extreme hurts the ear, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indi&s;|tinct ma&s;&s;es; be&s;ides its giving the Speaker the di&s;agreeable appearance of one who en|deavours to compel a&s;&s;ent, by mere vehe|mence and force of &s;ound.</P>
<P>IN the next place, to being well heard, and clearly under&s;tood, di&s;tinctne&s;s of arti|culation contributes more, perhaps, than more loudne&s;s of &s;ound. The quantity of &s;ound nece&s;&s;ary to fill even a large &s;pace, is &s;maller than is commonly imagined; and with di&s;tinct articulation, a man of a weak
<PB N="423" REF="426">
voice will make it reach farther, than the &s;tronge&s;t voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every Public Speaker ought to pay great attention. He mu&s;t give eve|ry &s;ound which he utters its due proportion, and make every &s;yllable, and even every letter in the word which he pronounces, be heard di&s;tinctly; without &s;lurring, whi&s;|pering, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any of the proper &s;ounds.</P>
<P>IN the third place, In order to articulate di&s;tinctly, moderation is requi&s;ite with re|gard to the &s;peed of pronouncing. Preci|pitancy of Speech, confounds all articula|tion, and all meaning. I need &s;carcely ob&s;erve, that there may be al&s;o an extreme on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. It is obvious, that a lifele&s;s, drawling Pronunciation, which allows the minds of the hearers to be al|ways outrunning the Speaker, mu&s;t render every Di&s;cour&s;e in&s;ipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of &s;peaking too fa&s;t is much more common, and requires the more to be guard edagain&s;t, becau&s;e, when it has grown up into a habit, few errors are more difficult to be corrected. To pronounce with a proper degree of &s;lowne&s;s, and with full and clear Articulation, is the fir&s;t thing to be &s;tudied by all who begin to &s;peak in public; and cannot be too much recommended to them. Such a Pronunciation, gives weight and dignity to their Di&s;cour&s;e. It is a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the
<PB N="424" REF="427">
voice, by the pau&s;es and re&s;ts which it allows it more ea&s;ily to make; and it enables the Speaker to &s;well all his &s;ounds, both with more force, and more mu&s;ic. It a&s;&s;i&s;ts him al&s;o in pre&s;erving a due command of him|&s;elf; whereas a rapid and hurried manner, is apt to excite that flutter of &s;pirits, which is the greate&s;t enemy to all right execution in the way of Oratory. <Q REND="inline">"Promptum &s;it os,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"non praeceps, moderatum, non lentum."</Q></P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e fundamental attentions to the pitch and management of the voice, to di&s;tinct Articulation, and to a proper de|gree of &s;lowne&s;s of &s;peech, what a Public Speaker mu&s;t, in the fourth place, &s;tudy, is, propriety of Pronunciation; or the giv|ing to every word, which he utters, that &s;ound which the mo&s;t polite u&s;age of the language appropriates to it; in oppo&s;ition, to broad, vulgar, or provincial Pronuncia|tion. This is requi&s;ite, both for &s;peaking intelligibly, and for &s;peaking with grace or beauty. In&s;tructions concerning this Arti|cle, can be given by the living voice only. But there is one ob&s;ervation, which it may not be improper here to make. In the Eng|li&s;h Language, every word which con&s;i&s;ts of more &s;yllables than one, has one accent|ed &s;yllable. The accent re&s;ts &s;ometimes on the vowel, &s;ometimes on the con&s;onant. Seldom, or never, is there more than one accented &s;yllable in any Engli&s;h word, how|ever
<PB N="425" REF="428">
long; and the genius of the language requires the voice to mark that &s;yllable by a &s;tronger percu&s;&s;ion, and to pa&s;s more &s;light|ly over the re&s;t. Now, having once learn|ed the proper &s;eats of the&s;e accents, it is an important rule, to give every word ju&s;t the &s;ame accent in Public Speaking, as in com|mon Di&s;cour&s;e. Many per&s;ons err in this re&s;pect. When they &s;peak in public, and with &s;olemnity, they pronounce the &s;ylla|bles in a different manner from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them, and protract them; they multiply accents on the &s;ame word; from a mi&s;taken notion, that it gives gravity and force to their Di&s;|cour&s;e, and adds to the pomp of Public De|clamation. Whereas, this is one of the greate&s;t faults that can be committed in Pro|nunciation; it makes what is called, a the|atrical, or mouthing manner; and gives an artificial affected air to Speech, which de|tracts greatly both from its agreeablene&s;s, and its impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to treat next of tho&s;e higher parts of delivery, by &s;tudying which, a Speaker has &s;omething farther in view than merely to render him&s;elf intelligible, and &s;eeks to give grace and force to what he ut|ters. The&s;e may be compri&s;ed under four heads, Empha&s;is, Pau&s;es, Tones, and Ge&s;|tures. Let me only premi&s;e, in general, to what I am to &s;ay concerning them, that at|tention to the&s;e articles of delivery is by no
<PB N="426" REF="429">
means to be confined, as &s;ome might be apt to imagine, to the more elaborate, and pa|thetic parts of a Di&s;cour&s;e. There is, per|haps, as great attention requi&s;ite, and as much &s;kill di&s;played, in adapting Empha&s;es, Pau&s;es, Tones, and Ge&s;tures, properly, to calm and plain Speaking; and the effect of a ju&s;t and graceful delivery will, in every part of a &s;ubject, be found of high import|ance for commanding attention, and enforc|ing what is &s;poken.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider Empha&s;is; by this, is meant a &s;tronger and fuller &s;ound of voice, by which we di&s;tingui&s;h the accented &s;yllable of &s;ome word, on which we de&s;ign to lay particular &s;tre&s;s, and to &s;how how it affects the re&s;t of the &s;entence. Sometimes the emphatic word mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a &s;tronger accent. On the right management of the Empha&s;is, depends the whole life and &s;pirit of every Di&s;cour&s;e. If no empha&s;is be placed on any words, not only is Di&s;|cour&s;e rendered heavy and lifele&s;s, but the meaning left often ambiguous. If the Em|pha&s;is be placed wrong, we pervert and con|found the meaning wholly. To give a com|mon in&s;tance; &s;uch a &s;imple que&s;tion as this: <Q REND="inline">"Do you ride to town to-day?"</Q> is capable, of no fewer than four different acceptations ac|cording as the Empha&s;is is differnetly placed on the words. If it be pronounced thus; do <HI>you</HI> ride to town to-day? the an&s;wer
<PB N="427" REF="430">
may naturally be, No; I &s;end my &s;ervant in my &s;tead. If thus; Do you <HI>ride</HI> to town to-day? An&s;wer, No; I intend to walk. Do you ride <HI>to town</HI> to-day? No; I ride out into the fields. Do you ride to town <HI>to-day?</HI> No; but I &s;hall to-morrow. In like man|ner, in &s;olemn Di&s;cour&s;e, the whole force and beauty of an expre&s;&s;ion often depends on the accented word; and we may pre&s;ent to the hearers quite different views of the &s;ame Sentiment, by placing the Empha&s;is differently. In the following words of our Saviour, ob&s;erve in what different lights the thought is placed, according as the words are pronounced. <Q REND="inline">"Judas, betraye&s;t thou the Son of Man with a ki&s;s?</Q> <HI>Betraye&s;t</HI> thou&mdash;makes the reproach turn, on the in|famy of treachery. Betraye&s;t <HI>thou</HI>&mdash;makes it re&s;t, upon Judas's connection with his ma&s;ter. Betraye&s;t thou the <HI>Son of Man</HI>&mdash;re&s;ts it, upon our Saviour's per&s;onal charac|ter and eminence. Betraye&s;t thou the Son of Man <HI>with a ki&s;s?</HI> turns it, upon his pro|&s;tituting the &s;ignal of peace and friend&s;hip, to the purpo&s;e of a mark of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>IN order to acquire the proper manage|ment of the Empha&s;is, the great rule, and indeed the only rule po&s;&s;ible to be given is, that the Speaker &s;tudy to attain a ju&s;t con|ception, of the force and &s;pirit of tho&s;e &s;entiments which he is to pronounce. For to lay the Empha&s;is with exact propriety, is a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of good &s;en&s;e, and atten|tion
<PB N="428" REF="431">
It is far from being an incon&s;iderable attainment. It is one of the greate&s;t trials of a true and ju&s;t ta&s;te; and mu&s;t ari&s;e from feeling delicately our&s;elves, and from judging accurately, of what is fitte&s;t to &s;trike the feeling of others. There is as great a difference between a Chapter of the Bible, or any other piece of plain pro&s;e, read by one who places the &s;everal Empha&s;es every where, with ta&s;te and judgment, and by one who neglects or mi&s;takes them, as there is between the &s;ame tune played by the mo&s;t ma&s;terly hand, or by the mo&s;t bung|ling performer.</P>
<P>IN all prepared Di&s;cour&s;es, it would be of great u&s;e, if they were read over or re|hear&s;ed in private, with this particular view, to &s;earch for the proper Empha&s;es be|fore they were pronounced in public; mark|ing, at the &s;ame time, with a pen, the em|phatical words in every Sentence, or at lea&s;t in the mo&s;t weighty and affecting parts of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and fixing them well in me|mory. Were this attention oftener be&s;tow|ed, were this part of Pronunciation &s;tudied with more exactne&s;s, and not left to the moment of delivery, as is commonly done, Public Speakers would find their care abun|dantly repaid, by the remarkable effects which it would produce upon their Audi|ence. Let me caution, at the &s;ame time, again&s;t one error, that of multiplying em|phatical words too much. It is only by a
<PB N="429" REF="432">
prudent re&s;erve in the u&s;e of them, that we can give them any weight. If they re|cur too often; if a Speaker attempts to render every thing which he &s;ays of high importance, by a multitude of &s;trong Empha|&s;es, we &s;oon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every Sentence with em|phatical words, is like crowding all the pages of a Book with Italic Characters, which, as to the effect, is ju&s;t the &s;ame with u&s;ing no &s;uch di&s;tinctions at all.</P>
<P>NEXT to Empha&s;is, the pau&s;es in Speak|ing demand attention. The&s;e are of two kinds; fir&s;t, Emphatical Pau&s;es; and next, &s;uch as mark the di&s;tinctions of Sen&s;e. An Emphatical Pau&s;e is made, after &s;omething has been &s;aid of peculiar moment, and on which we want to fix the hearer's attention. Sometimes, before &s;uch a thing is &s;aid, we u&s;her it in with a pau&s;e of this nature. Such pau&s;es have the &s;ame effect, as a &s;trong Em|pha&s;is; and are &s;ubject to the &s;ame rules; e&s;pecially to the caution ju&s;t now given, of not repeating them too frequently. For as they excite uncommon attention, and of cour&s;e rai&s;e expectation, if the importance of the matter be not fully an&s;werable to &s;uch expectation, they occa&s;ion di&s;appointment and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t frequent and the principal u&s;e of pau&s;es, is to mark the divi&s;ions of
<PB N="430" REF="433">
the &s;en&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to allow the Speaker to draw his breath; and the proper and graceful adju&s;tment of &s;uch pau|&s;es, is one of the mo&s;t nice and difficult ar|ticles in delivery. In all Public Speaking, the management of the breath requires a good deal of care, &s;o as not to be obliged to divide words from one another, which have &s;o intimate a connection, that they ought to be pronounced with the &s;ame breath, and without the lea&s;t &s;eparation. Many a &s;entence is mi&s;erably mangled, and the force of the Empha&s;is totally lo&s;t, by divi&s;ions being made in the wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is &s;peak|ing, &s;hould be very careful to provide a full &s;upply of breath for what he is to utter. It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that the breath mu&s;t be drawn, only at the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It can ea&s;ily be gathered at the intervals of the period, when the voice is only &s;u&s;pend|ed for a moment; and, by this management, one may have always a &s;ufficient &s;tock for carrying on the longe&s;t Sentences, without improper interruptions.</P>
<P>IF any one, in Public Speaking, &s;hall have formed to him&s;elf a certain melody or tune, which requires re&s;t and pau&s;es of its own, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;e, he has, for certain contracted one of the wor&s;t habits into which a Public Speaker can fall. It is the &s;en&s;e which &s;hould always rule the
<PB N="431" REF="434">
pau&s;es of the voice; for wherever there is any &s;en&s;ible &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the voice, the hearer is always led to expect &s;omewhat cor|re&s;ponding in the meaning. Pau&s;es in Pub|lic Di&s;cour&s;e, mu&s;t be formed upon the manner in which we utter our&s;elves in or|dinary, &s;en&s;ible conver&s;ation; and not upon the &s;tiff artificial manner which we acquire, from reading books according to the com|mon punctuation. The general run of punctuation is very arbitrary; often caprici|ous and fal&s;e; and dictates an uniformity of tone in the pau&s;es, which is extremely di&s;|agreeable: for we are to ob&s;erve, that to render pau&s;es graceful and expre&s;&s;ive, they mu&s;t not only be made in the right place, but al&s;o be accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by which the nature of the&s;e pau&s;es is intimated; much more than by the length of them, which can never be ex|actly mea&s;ured. Sometimes it is only a &s;light and &s;imple &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of voice that is proper; &s;ometimes a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and &s;ometimes that peculiar tone and cadence, which denotes the Sentence fini&s;hed. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, we are to regulate our&s;elves, by attending to the manner in which Nature teaches us to &s;peak, when engaged in real and earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with others.</P>
<P>WHEN we are reading or reciting ver&s;e, there is a peculiar difficulty in making the pau&s;es ju&s;tly. The difficulty ari&s;es from
<PB N="432" REF="435">
the melody of ver&s;e, which dictates to the ear pau&s;es or re&s;ts of its own; and to adju&s;t and compound the&s;e properly with the pau&s;es of the &s;en&s;e, &s;o as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the under&s;tanding, is &s;o very nice a matter, that it is no wonder we &s;o &s;eldom meet with good readers of poetry. There are two kinds of pau&s;es that belong to the mu&s;ic of ver&s;e; one is, the pau&s;e at the end of the line; and the other, the cae|&s;ural pau&s;e in the middle of it. With regard to the pau&s;e at the end of the line, which marks that Strain or Ver&s;e to be fini&s;hed, Rhyme renders this always &s;en&s;ible, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure compels us to ob&s;erve it in our Pronunciation. In blank ver&s;e, where there is a greater liberty permitted of run|ning the lines into one another, &s;ometimes without any &s;u&s;pen&s;ion in the &s;en&s;e, it has been made a que&s;tion, Whether in reading &s;uch ver&s;e with propriety, any regard at all &s;hould be paid to the clo&s;e of a line? On the Stage, where the appearance of &s;peaking in ver&s;e &s;hould always be avoided, there can, I think, be no doubt, that the clo&s;e of &s;uch lines as make no pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e, &s;hould not be rendered perceptible to the ear. But on other occa&s;ions, this were improper: for what is the u&s;e of melody, or for what end has the Poet compo&s;ed in ver&s;e, if in reading his lines, we &s;uppre&s;s his numbers; and degrade them, by our Pronunciation, into mere pro&s;e? We ought, therefore, certainly to read blank ver&s;e &s;o, as to make
<PB N="433" REF="436">
every line &s;en&s;ible to the ear. At the &s;ame time in doing &s;o, every appearance of &s;ing|&s;ong and tone, mu&s;t be carefully guarded again&s;t. The clo&s;e of the line, where it makes no pau&s;e in the meaning, ought to be marked, not by &s;uch a tone as is u&s;ed in fini&s;hing a &s;entence; but without either letting the voice fall, or elevating it, it &s;hould be marked only by &s;uch a &s;light &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of &s;ound, as may di&s;tingui&s;h the pa&s;&s;age from one line to another, without injuring the meaning.</P>
<P>THE other kind of mu&s;ical pau&s;e, is that which falls &s;omewhere about the middle of the ver&s;e, and divides it into two hemi&s;|tichs; a pau&s;e, not &s;o great as that which belongs to the clo&s;e of the line, but &s;till &s;en&s;ible to an ordinary ear. This, which is called the cae&s;ural pau&s;e, in the French heroic ver&s;e falls uniformly in the middle of the line. In the Engli&s;h, it may fall af|ter the 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th &s;yllables in the line, and no other. Where the ver&s;e is &s;o con&s;tructed, that this cae&s;ural pau&s;e coincides with the &s;lighte&s;t pau&s;e or divi|&s;ion in the &s;en&s;e, the line can be read ea&s;i|ly; as in the two fir&s;t ver&s;es of Mr. Pope's Me&s;&s;iah,
<Q><L>Ye nymphs of Solyma! begin the &s;ong;</L>
<L>To heavenly themes, &s;ublimer &s;trains belong.</L></Q>
<PB N="434" REF="437">
But if it &s;hall happen that words, which have &s;uch a &s;trict and intimate connection, as not to bear even a momentary &s;epara|tion, are divided from one another by this cae&s;ural pau&s;e, we then feel a &s;ort of &s;trug|gle between the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound, which renders it difficult to read &s;uch lines grace|fully. The rule of proper Pronunciation in &s;uch ca&s;es is, to regard only the pau&s;e which the &s;en&s;e forms; and to read the line accordingly. The neglect of the cae&s;ural pau&s;e, may make the line &s;ound &s;omewhat unharmoniou&s;ly; but the effect would be much wor&s;e, if the &s;en&s;e were &s;acrificed to the &s;ound. For in&s;tance, in the following line of Milton,
<Q><L>&mdash;What in me is dark,</L>
<L>Illumine; what is low, rai&s;e and &s;upport.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e clearly dictates the pau&s;e af|ter "illumine," at the end of the third &s;yl|lable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though, if the melody only were to be regarded, "illumine" &s;hould be connected with what follows, and the pau&s;e not made till the 4th or 6th &s;yllable. So in the following line of Mr. Pope's (Epi&s;tle to Dr. Arbuthnot):
<Q><L>I &s;it, with &s;ad civility I read.</L></Q></P>
<P>The ear plainly paints out the cae&s;ural pau&s;e as &s;alling after "&s;ad," the 4th &s;ylla|ble.
<PB N="435" REF="438">
But it would be very bad reading to make any pau&s;e there, &s;o as to &s;eperate "&s;ad" and "civility." The &s;en&s;e admits of no other pau&s;e than after the &s;econd &s;yllable "&s;it," which therefore mu&s;t be the only pau&s;e made in the reading.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to treat next of Tones in Pro|nunciation, which are different both from empha&s;is and pau&s;es; con&s;i&s;ting in the modu|lation of the voice, the notes or variations of &s;ound which we employ in Public Speaking. How much of the propriety, the force and grace of Di&s;cour&s;e, mu&s;t de|pend on the&s;e, will appear from this &s;ingle con&s;ideration; that to almo&s;t every &s;enti|ment we utter, more e&s;pecially to every &s;trong emotion, Nature hath adapted &s;ome peculiar tone of voice; in&s;omuch, that he who &s;hould tell another that he was very angry, or very grieved, in a tone which did not &s;uit &s;uch emotions, in&s;tead of being believed, would be laughed at. Sympathy is one of the mo&s;t powerful principles by which Per&s;ua&s;ive Di&s;cour&s;e works its effect. The Speaker endeavours to transfu&s;e into his hearers his own &s;entiments and emo|tions; which he can never be &s;ucce&s;sful in doing, unle&s;s he utters them in &s;uch a man|ner as to convince the hearers that he feels them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"All that pa&s;&s;es in the mind of man may be reduced to two cla&s;&s;es, which I call Ideas and Emotions. By Ideas, I mean all thoughts which ri&s;e, and pa&s;s in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the mind. By Emotions, all exertions of the mind in arranging, combining, and &s;eparating its ideas; as well as all the ef|fects produced on the mind it&s;elf by tho&s;e ideas, from the more violent agitation of the pa&s;&s;ions, to the calmer feelings produced by the operation of the intellect and the fancy.

of tones, therefore, de&s;erves to be at|tentively &s;tudied by every one who would be a &s;ucce&s;sful Orator.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t and mo&s;t material in&s;truc|tion which can be given for this purpo&s;e is, to form the tones of Public Speaking upon the tones of &s;en&s;ible and animated conver|&s;ation. We may ob&s;erve that every man, when he is much in earne&s;t in common Di&s;cour&s;e, when he is engaged in &s;peaking on &s;ome &s;ubject which intere&s;ts him nearly, has an eloquent or per&s;ua&s;ive tone and manner. What is the rea&s;on of our being often &s;o frigid and unper&s;ua&s;ive in Public Di&s;cour&s;e, but our departing from the na|tural tone of Speaking, and delivering our|&s;elves in an affected artificial manner? No|thing can be more ab&s;urd than to imagine, that as &s;oon as one mounts a Pulpit, or ri&s;es in a Public A&s;&s;embly, he is in&s;tantly to lay a&s;ide the voice with which he ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in private; to a&s;&s;ume a new,
<PB N="437" REF="440">
&s;tudied tone, and a cadence altogether fo|reign to his natural manner. This has vitiated all delivery; this has given ri&s;e to cant and tedious monotony, in the different kinds of Modern Public Speaking, e&s;pecially in the Pulpit. Men departed from Nature; and &s;ought to give a beauty or force, as they imagined, to their Di&s;cour&s;e, by &s;ub|&s;tituting certain &s;tudied mu&s;ical tones, in the room of the genuine expre&s;&s;ions of &s;en|timent, which the voice carries in natural Di&s;cour&s;e. Let every Public Speaker guard again&s;t this error. Whether he &s;peak in a private room, or in a great A&s;&s;embly, let him remember that he &s;till &s;peaks. Follow Nature: con&s;ider how &s;he teaches you to utter any &s;entiment or feeling of your heart. Imagine a &s;ubject of debate &s;tarted in con|ver&s;ation among grave and wi&s;e men, and your&s;elf bearing a &s;hare in it. Think after what manner, with what tones and inflex|ions of voice, you would on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion expre&s;s your&s;elf, when you was mo&s;t in earne&s;t, and &s;ought mo&s;t to be li&s;tened to. Carry the&s;e with you to the Bar, to the Pulpit, or to any Public A&s;&s;embly; let the&s;e be the foundation of your manner of pronouncing there; and you will take the &s;ure&s;t method of rendering your delivery both agreeable, and per&s;ua&s;ive.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid, Let the&s;e conver&s;ation tones be the <HI>foundation</HI> of Public Pronunci|ation; for, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, &s;olemn Pub|lic
<PB N="438" REF="441">
Speaking requires them to be exalted beyond the &s;train of common Di&s;cour&s;e. In a formal &s;tudied Oration, the elevation of the Style, and the harmony of the Sentences, prompt, almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, a modulation of voice more rounded, and bordering more upon mu&s;ic, than conver&s;ation admits. This gives ri&s;e to what is called, the Declai|ming Manner. But though this mode of Pronunciation runs con&s;iderably beyond or|dinary Di&s;cour&s;e, yet &s;till it mu&s;t have, for its ba&s;is, the natural tones of grave and dig|nified conver&s;ation. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, at the &s;ame time, that the con&s;tant indulgence of a declamatory manner, is not favourable ei|ther to good compo&s;ition, or good delivery; and is in hazard of betraying Public Speak|ers into that monotony of tone and ca|dence, which is &s;o generally complained of. Whereas, he who forms the general run of his delivery upon a &s;peaking manner, is not likely ever to become di&s;agreeable through monotony. He will have the &s;ame natural variety in his tones, which a per&s;on has in conver&s;ation. Indeed, the perfec|tion of delivery requires both the&s;e differ|ent manners, that of &s;peaking with liveli|ne&s;s and ea&s;e, and that of declaiming with &s;tateline&s;s and dignity, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one man; and to be employed by him, accord|ing as the different parts of his Di&s;cour&s;e require either the one or the other. This is a perfection which not many attain; the greate&s;t part of Public Speakers, allowing
<PB N="439" REF="442">
their delivery to be formed altogether acci|dentally; according as &s;ome turn of voice appears to them mo&s;t beautiful, or &s;ome ar|tificial model has caught their fancy; and acquiring, by this means, a habit of Pro|nunciation, which they can never vary. But the capital direction, which ought ne|ver to be forgotten is, to copy the proper tones for expre&s;&s;ing every &s;entiment from tho&s;e which Nature dictates to us, in con|ver&s;ation with others; to &s;peak always with her voice; and not to form to our|&s;elves a fanta&s;tic public manner, from an ab&s;urd fancy of its being more beautiful than a natural one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Loquere,"</Q> (&s;ays an Author of the la&s;t century, who has written a Treati&s;e in Ver&s;e, de Ge&s;tu et Voce Oratoris)

<P>IT now remains to treat of ge&s;ture, or what is called action in public Di&s;cour&s;e. Some nations animate their words in com|mon conver&s;ation, with many more motions of the body than others do. The French and the Italians are, in this re&s;pect, much more &s;prightly than we. But there is no nation, hardly any per&s;on &s;o phlegmatic, as not to accompany their words with &s;ome actions and ge&s;ticulations, on all occa&s;ions, when they are much in earne&s;t. It is there|fore
<PB N="440" REF="443">
unnatural in a Public Speaker, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with that earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s which he ought to &s;how in all af|fairs of moment, to remain quite unmoved in his outward appearance; and to let the words drop from his mouth, without any expre&s;&s;ion of meaning, or warmth in his ge&s;ture.</P>
<P>THE fundamental rule as to propriety of action, is undoubtedly the &s;ame with what I gave as to propriety of tone. Attend to the looks and ge&s;tures, in which earne&s;tne&s;s, indignation, compa&s;&s;ion, or any other emo|tion, di&s;covers it&s;elf to mo&s;t advantage in the common intercour&s;e of men; and let the&s;e be your model. Some of the&s;e looks and ge&s;tures are common to all men; and there are al&s;o certain peculiarities of manner which di&s;tingui&s;h every individual. A Public Speaker mu&s;t take that manner which is mo&s;t natural to him&s;elf. For it is here, ju&s;t as in tones. It is not the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a Speaker to form to him&s;elf a cer|tain &s;et of motions and ge&s;tures, which he thinks mo&s;t becoming and agreeable, and to practi&s;e the&s;e in public, without their having any corre&s;pondence to the manner which is natural to him in private. His ge&s;tures and motions ought all to carry that kind of expre&s;&s;ion which nature has dictat|ed to him; and, unle&s;s this be the ca&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible, by means of any &s;tudy, to avoid their appearing &s;tiff and forced.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="444">
HOWEVER, although nature mu&s;t be the groundwork, I admit that there is room in this matter for &s;ome &s;tudy and art. For many per&s;ons are naturally ungraceful in the motions which they make; and this un|gracefulne&s;s might, in part at lea&s;t, be re|formed by application and care. The &s;tudy of action in Public Speaking, con&s;i&s;ts chief|ly in guarding again&s;t awkward and di&s;a|greeable motions, and in learning to perform &s;uch as are natural to the Speaker, in the mo&s;t becoming manner. For this end, it has been advi&s;ed by Writers on this &s;ub|ject, to practice before a mirror, where one may &s;ee, and judge of their own ge&s;tures. But I am afraid, per&s;ons are not always the be&s;t judges of the gracefulne&s;s of their own motions; and one may declaim long enough before a mirror, without correcting any of his faults. The judgment of a friend, who&s;e good ta&s;te they can tru&s;t, will be found of much greater advantage to begin|ners, than any mirror they can u&s;e. With regard to particular rules concerning action and ge&s;ticulation, Quinctilian has delivered a great many, in the la&s;t Chapter of the 11th Book of his In&s;titutions; and all the Modern Writers on this &s;ubject have done little el&s;e but tran&s;late them. I am not of opinion, that &s;uch rules, delivered either by the voice or on paper, can be of much u&s;e,
<PB N="442" REF="445">
unle&s;s per&s;ons &s;aw them exemplified before their eyes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The few following hints only I &s;hall adventure to throw out, in ca&s;e they may be of any &s;ervice. When &s;peaking in public, one &s;hould &s;tudy to pre&s;erve as much dignity as po&s;&s;i|ble in the whole attitude of the body. An erect po&s;ture is generally to be cho&s;en; &s;tanding firm, &s;o as to have the fulle&s;t and free&s;t command of all his motions; any inclination which is u&s;ed, &s;hould be forwards towards the hearers, which is a natural expre&s;&s;ion of earne&s;tne&s;s. As for the countenance, the chief rule is, that it &s;hould corre&s;pond with the nature of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and when no particular emotion is expre&s;&s;ed, a &s;erious and manly look, is always the be&s;t. The eyes &s;hould never be fixed clo&s;e on any one object, but move ea&s;ily round the Audience. In the motions made with the hands, con&s;i&s;ts the chief part of ge&s;ture in Speaking. The ancients con|demned all motions performed by the left hand alone; but I am not &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e are always offen&s;ive, though it is natural for the right hand to be more frequently employed. Warm emotions demand the motion of both hands corre&s;|ponding together. But whether one ge&s;ticulates with one or with both hands, it is an important rule, that all his motions &s;hould be free and ea&s;y. Narrow and &s;traitened movements are generally ungraceful; for which rea&s;on, motions made with the hands are directed to proceed from the &s;houlder, ra|ther than from the elbow. Perpendicular movements too with the hands, that is, in the &s;treight line up and down, which Shake&s;peare in Hamlet calls <Q REND="inline">"&s;awing the air with the hand,"</Q> are &s;eldom good. Oblique motions are, in general, the mo&s;t graceful. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">o &s;udden and nimble motions &s;hould be likewi&s;e avoided.

<P>I SHALL only add further on this head, that in order to &s;ucceed well in delivery, no|thing is more nece&s;&s;ary than for a Speaker to guard again&s;t a certain flutter of &s;pirits, which is peculiarly incident to tho&s;e who begin to &s;peak in public. He mu&s;t endea|vour
<PB N="443" REF="446">
above all things to be recollected, and ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. For this end, he will find nothing of more u&s;e to him, than to &s;tudy to become wholly engaged in his &s;ub|ject; to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of its im|portance or &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; to be concerned much more to per&s;uade, than to plea&s;e. He will generally plea&s;e mo&s;t, when plea&s;|ing is not his &s;ole nor chief aim. This is the only rational and proper method of rai&s;|ing one's &s;elf above that timid and ba&s;hful regard to an Audience, which is &s;o ready to di&s;concert a Speaker, both as to what he is to &s;ay, and as to his manner of &s;aying it.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude, without an earne&s;t admonition to guard again&s;t all affectation, which is the certain ruin of good delivery. Let your manner, whatever it is, be your own; neither imitated from another, nor a&s;&s;umed upon &s;ome imaginary model, which is unnatural to you. Whatever is native, even though accompanied with &s;everal de|fects, yet is likely to plea&s;e; becau&s;e it &s;hows us a man; becau&s;e it has the appear|ance of coming from the heart. Whereas a delivery, attended with &s;everal acquired graces and beauties, if it be not ea&s;y and free, if it betray the marks of art and affec|tation, never fails to di&s;gu&s;t. To attain any extremely correct, and perfectly grace|ful delivery, is what few can expect; &s;o many natural talents being requi&s;ite to con|cur in forming it. But to attain, what as
