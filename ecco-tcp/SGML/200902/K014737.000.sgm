<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE MANNERS OF THE GREAT.</HEAD>
<P>TO a large and honourable cla&s;s of the community, to per&s;ons con&s;iderable in reputation, important by their condition in life, and com|mendable for the decency of their general conduct, the&s;e &s;light hints are re&s;pectfully addre&s;&s;ed. They are not intended as a &s;atire upon
<PB N="2" REF="3">vice, or a ridicule upon folly, being written neither for the fooli&s;h nor the vicious. The &s;ubject is too &s;erious for ridicule; and tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed are too re&s;pectable for &s;atire. It is recommended to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who, filling the higher ranks in life, are naturally regarded as patterns, by which the manners of the re&s;t of the world are to be fa&s;hioned.</P>
<P>The ma&s;s of mankind, in mo&s;t places, and in mo&s;t conditions of life, is perhaps chiefly compo&s;ed of what may be termed <HI>good kind of</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4"><HI>people;</HI> for per&s;ons of very flagitious wickedne&s;s are almo&s;t as rare as tho&s;e of very eminent piety: to the latter of the&s;e, admonition were impertinent; to the former it were &s;uperfluous. The&s;e remarks, there|fore, are principally written with a view to tho&s;e per&s;ons of rank and fortune who live within the re&s;traints of moral obligation, and acknow|ledge the truth of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion: and who, if in certain in&s;tances they allow them&s;elves in practices not compatible with a &s;trict pro|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, &s;eem to do it rather from habit and want of re|flection,
<PB N="4" REF="5">than either from di&s;belief of its doctrines, or contempt of its precepts.</P>
<P>Incon&s;ideration, Fa&s;hion, and the World, are three con&s;ederates again&s;t Virtue, with whom even good kind of people often contrive to live on excellent terms: and the fair repu|tation which may be obtained by a complai&s;ant conformity to the pre|vailing practice, and by mere de|corum of manners, without a &s;trict attention to religious principle, is a con&s;tant &s;ource of danger to the rich and great. There is &s;omething al|mo&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="6">irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;educing in the con|tagion of general example: hence the nece&s;&s;ity of that vigilance, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;tianity to quicken by ince&s;&s;ant admonition, and of the world, to lay a&s;leep by the perpetual opiates of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A fair reputation is one of the mo&s;t laudable objects of human am|bition; yet even this really valuable ble&s;&s;ing is &s;ometimes converted into a &s;nare, by inducing a treacherous &s;ecurity as &s;oon as it is obtained. A fatal indolence is apt to creep in
<PB N="6" REF="7">upon the &s;oul when it has once acquired the good opinion of man|kind, if the acqui&s;ition of that good opinion was the ultimate end of its endeavours. Pur&s;uit is at an end when the object is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for he is not likely to "pre&s;s forward" who thinks he has already <Q>at|tained</Q> The love of worldly reputation, and the de&s;ire of God's favour, have this &s;pecific difference, that in the latter, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion al|ways augments the de&s;ire; and the &s;piritual mind accounts nothing done while any thing remains undone.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">But after all, a fair fame, and the &s;upport of numbers, is obviou&s;ly a deceitful dependence; for as every individual mu&s;t die for him&s;elf, and an&s;wer for him&s;elf, both the&s;e imaginary re&s;ources will fail, ju&s;t at the moment when they could have been of any u&s;e. A good reputa|tion, even without internal piety, would be worth obtaining, if the tribunal of heaven were fa&s;hioned after the manner of human courts of judicature. If at the general judgment we were to be tried by a jury of our fellow mortals, it would be but common prudence to &s;ecure
<PB N="8" REF="9">their favour at any price. But it can now &s;tand us in little &s;tead in the great day of deci&s;ion, as it is the con&s;ummation of infinite goodne&s;s, not to abandon us to the mercy of each other's &s;entence; but to re&s;erve us for <HI>his</HI> final judgment who knows every motive of every action; who will make &s;trict inqui&s;ition into &s;in|cerity of heart, and uprightne&s;s of intention; in who&s;e eyes an ineffec|tual prayer, or a powerle&s;s wi&s;h, will outweigh the mo&s;t &s;plendid profe&s;|&s;ion, or the mo&s;t dazzling action.</P>
<P>We cannot but rejoice in every
<PB N="9" REF="10">degree of human virtue which ope|rates favourably on &s;ociety, whatever be the motive, or whoever be the actor; and we &s;hould gladly com|mend every degree of goodne&s;s, though it be not &s;quared by our own rules and notions. Even the good actions of &s;uch per&s;ons as are too much actuated by a regard to appearances, are not without their beneficial effects. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e who occupy this middle re|gion of morality certainly exceeds the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; for they are not only exact in ceremonials, but in many
<PB N="10" REF="11">re&s;pects fulfil the weightier matters of law and con&s;cience. Like Herod, they often <Q>hear gladly, and do many things.</Q> Yet I am afraid I &s;hall be thought fevere in remarking that, in general, tho&s;e characters in the New Te&s;tament, of who&s;e future condition no very comfortable hope is given, &s;eem to have been taken, not from the profligate, the aban|doned, and the di&s;honourable; but from that decent cla&s;s commonly de&s;cribed by the term of <HI>good &s;ort of people;</HI> that mixed kind of charac|ter in which virtue appears, if it does not predominate. The young Ruler
<PB N="11" REF="12">was certainly one of the fir&s;t of this order; and yet we are left in dark uncertainty, as to his final allotment. The rich man who built him barns and &s;torehou&s;es, and only propo&s;ed to him&s;elf the full enjoyment of that fortune, which, perhaps, he had very fairly obtained, might have been, for all that appears to the con|trary, a very good &s;ort of man; at lea&s;t, if we may judge of him by multitudes who live preci&s;ely for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, and yet enjoy a good degree of credit, and are rather con|&s;idered as objects of admiration than of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">But the mo&s;t alarming in&s;tance is he, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, and gave nothing to Lazarus; and who is repre&s;ented after death as lifting up his eyes, being in tor|ments. He committed no enormi|ties that have been tran&s;mitted to us; for that he dined well, dre&s;&s;ed well, and refu&s;ed to relieve one beg|gar, could hardly incur the bitter penalty of eternal mi&s;ery. His puni&s;hment &s;eems to have been the con&s;equence of a hard, worldly, &s;elfi&s;h heart, &s;poilt by the &s;oftne&s;&s;es and delights of life. There is no
<PB N="13" REF="14">error more common, or more danger|ous, than that an unre&s;trained indul|gence of appetite is generally at|tended with a liberal, humane, and merciful temper. Nor is there any opinion more fal&s;e and more fatal, or which demands to be more &s;tea|dily controverted, than that libertin|i&s;m and goodnature are natural and nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;ociates. For after all that corrupt poets, and more corrupt philo&s;ophers, have told us of the blandi&s;hments of plea&s;ure, and of its tendency to &s;often the temper, and humanize the affections, it is certain, that nothing hardens the
<PB N="14" REF="15">heart like exce&s;&s;ive and unbounded luxury: and he who refu&s;es the fewe&s;t gratifications to his own vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s, will generally be found the lea&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s for the wants of others. The cruel|ties at Rome bore an exact propor|tion to the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s at Capreae. And it is not le&s;s notorious, that the Imperial fidler became more barbar|ous, as he grew more profligate. Pro&s;perity, &s;ays the Arabian pro|verb, fills the heart till it makes it hard; and the mo&s;t dangerous pits and &s;nares for human virtue are tho&s;e, which are &s;o covered over
<PB N="15" REF="16">with the flowers of pro&s;perous for|tune, that it requires a cautious foot, and a vigilant eye, to e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Even Ananias and Saphira were, I doubt not, well e&s;teemed in &s;o|ciety; for it was enough to e&s;tabli&s;h a very con&s;iderable reputation to &s;ell even part of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for religious purpo&s;es: but what an alarm does it &s;ound to hypocri&s;y, that in&s;tead of being rewarded for what they brought, they were pu|ni&s;hed for what they kept back! And it is to be feared, that this de|ceitful pair are not the only one,
<PB N="16" REF="17">upon whom a good action, without a pure intention, has drawn down a righteous retribution.</P>
<P>For though outward actions are the &s;ure&s;t, and to human eyes, the only evidences of &s;incerity, yet Chri&s;tianity is a religion of <HI>motives</HI> and <HI>principles.</HI> The Go&s;pel is con|tinually referring to the <HI>heart,</HI> as the &s;ource of good; it is to the poor in <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> to the pure in <HI>heart,</HI> that the divine ble&s;&s;ing is annexed. A man may correct many improper prac|tices, and refrain from many im|moral actions, from merely human
<PB N="17" REF="18">motives; but, though this partial amendment is not without its u&s;es, yet this is only attacking &s;ymptoms, and neglecting the mortal di&s;ea&s;e. But to &s;ubdue a worldly temper, to control irregular de&s;ires, and to have a clean heart, is to extingui&s;h the &s;oul, and &s;pirit, and e&s;&s;ence of &s;in. Totally to <HI>accompli&s;h</HI> this, is, per|haps, beyond the narrow limits of human perfection; but to <HI>attempt</HI> it (with an humble reliance on &s;upe|rior aid), is &s;o far from being an ex|travagant or romantic flight of virtue, that it is but the common duty of every ordinary Chri&s;tian. And this
<PB N="18" REF="19">perfection is not the le&s;s real, becau&s;e it is a point which &s;eems con&s;tantly to recede from our approaches. Our highe&s;t attainments, in&s;tead of bringing us "to the mark," only teach us to remove the mark to a greater di&s;tance, by giving us more humbling views of our&s;elves, and more exalted conceptions of the &s;tate which we are labouring after. Though the progre&s;s towards perfec|tion may be perpetual in this world, the actual attainment is re&s;erved for a better. And this re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of a happine&s;s which we cannot reach, and this lively idea of a perfection
<PB N="19" REF="20">which we cannot attain, are among the many arguments for a future &s;tate, which &s;eem to come little &s;hort of ab&s;olute demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t remember, that this is not a &s;ermon, but a mere &s;uperficial e&s;&s;ay. I am neither an old man, a clergyman, nor a methodi&s;t, &s;o that it is at lea&s;t <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that I may be neither actuated by moro&s;ene&s;s, &s;elf|intere&s;t, nor enthu&s;ia&s;m. I live much in the world, and have as much &s;atisfaction in its lawful plea|&s;ures, and permitted indulgencies, as other men. I endeavour to cul|tivate
<PB N="20" REF="21">the greate&s;t candour for the opinions, and affection for the per|&s;ons of all my fellow creatures. I am charmed with the humanity, genero&s;ity, and integrity, even of worldly men. But one virtue mu&s;t not intrench upon other. Charity mu&s;t not &s;upplant faith. If a man be generous, good natured, and hu|mane, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel for him the tenderne&s;s of a brother; but if, at the &s;ame time, he be irre|ligious, intemperate, or profane, who &s;hall dare to &s;ay he is in a &s;afe &s;tate? Good humour, and generous &s;entiments, will always make a man
<PB N="21" REF="22">a plea&s;ant acquaintance; but who &s;hall lower the doctrines of the Go&s;|pel, to accommodate them to the conduct of men? Who &s;hall bend a &s;trait rule, to favour a crooked prac|tice? Who &s;hall controvert that authority which has &s;aid, that <HI>with|out holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>May I venture to be a little para|doxical; and while &s;o many grave per&s;ons are de&s;canting on the mi&s;|chiefs of vice, may I be permitted to &s;ay a word on the mi&s;chiefs of virtue; or, rather, of that &s;hining counterfeit, which, while it wants
<PB N="22" REF="23">the &s;pecific gravity, has much of the brightne&s;s of &s;terling worth? Ne|ver, perhaps, did any age produce more beautiful declamations in prai&s;e of virtue than the pre&s;ent; never were more poli&s;hed periods round|ed in honour of humanity. An ancient Pagan would imagine that A&s;trea had returned to take up her abode in our metropolis; a primi|tive Chri&s;tian would conclude, that <Q>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace had there met together.</Q> But how would they be &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the obliga|tion to the&s;e duties was not always thought binding on their eloquent
<PB N="23" REF="24">encomia&s;ts! that univer&s;al bene|volence may &s;ub&s;i&s;t with partial inju&s;tice, and boundle&s;s liberality with &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s! that one may &s;eem eager in redre&s;&s;ing the injuries of half the globe, without de&s;cending to the petty detail of private virtues; and burn with zeal for the good of millions one never &s;aw, and yet &s;pread vice and ruin through the little circle of one's own per&s;onal influence!</P>
<P>When the general texture of an irregular life is &s;pangled over with &s;ome con&s;titutional plea&s;ing
<PB N="24" REF="25">qualities; when gaiety, good hu|mour, and a thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion of expence throw a lu&s;tre round the faultie&s;t characters, it is no wonder that common ob&s;ervers are blinded into admiration: a profu&s;e gene|ro&s;ity dazzles them more than all the duties of the decalogue. But though it may be a very u&s;eful quality towards &s;ecuring the elec|tion of a borough, it will contribute but little towards making &s;ure the calling and election to the kingdom of heaven. It is &s;omewhat &s;trange that extravagance &s;hould be the great criterion of goodne&s;s with tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="26">very people who are them&s;elves the victims to this idol; for the prodi|gal pays no debts if he can help it: and it is notorious, that in one of the wittie&s;t and mo&s;t popular come|dies which this country has ever produced, tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ages which exalt liberality at the expence of ju&s;tice, were nightly applauded with enthu&s;ia&s;tic rapture by tho&s;e deluded trade&s;men, whom, perhaps, that very &s;entiment helped to keep out of their money.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;ort of fa&s;hion|able character, who&s;e fal&s;e bright|ne&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="27">is &s;till more pernicious, by ca&s;t|ing a &s;plendour over the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive vices. Corrupt manners, ruinous extravagance, and the mo&s;t fatal pa&s;&s;ion for play, are &s;ometimes gilded over with many engaging acts of charity, and a general atten|tion and re&s;pect to the ceremonials of Chri&s;tianity. But this is degrad|ing the venerable image and &s;uper|&s;cription of religion, by &s;tamping them on ba&s;er metal than they were ever intended to impre&s;s. The young and gay &s;helter them&s;elves under &s;uch examples, and &s;cruple the le&s;s to adopt the bad parts of &s;uch mixed
<PB N="27" REF="28">characters, when they &s;ee that an immoral conduct is &s;o compatible with a religious profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But I digre&s;s from my intention; for it is not the purpo&s;e of this ad|dre&s;s to take notice of any actions which the common con&s;ent of man|kind has determined to be wrong; but of &s;uch, chiefly, as are practi&s;ed by the &s;ober, the decent, and the regular; and to drop a few hints on &s;uch le&s;s obvious offences as are, in general,
<Q>Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne.</Q> Nor will the bounds which I have
<PB N="28" REF="29">pre&s;cribed my&s;elf allow of my wan|dering into a wide and general field of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The idea of the pre&s;ent &s;light performance was &s;ugge&s;ted by read|ing the King's late excellent procla|mation again&s;t irreligion and immo|rality. Under the &s;helter of &s;o high a &s;anction it may not be un&s;ea&s;ona|ble to pre&s;s on the hearts of the better di&s;po&s;ed, &s;uch ob&s;ervances as &s;eem to be generally overlooked; and to remark &s;uch offences as com|monly elude cen&s;ure, becau&s;e they are not commonly thought cen&s;urable.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">It is obvious to all &s;erious per|&s;ons, that that branch of the divine law, again&s;t which the better kind of people tre&s;pa&s;s with the lea&s;t &s;cruple, is the fourth commandment. Many who would &s;hudder at the violation of the other nine, &s;eem without ceremony to expunge this from the divine code; but by what authority they do this, has never been explained. The Chri&s;tian legi&s;lator does not &s;eem to have abridged the commandments; and there is no &s;ub&s;equent authority &s;o much as pre|tended to by Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">It is not here intended to take notice of &s;uch flagrant offences as lie open to the cognizance of higher tribunals; or to pollute this paper with de&s;canting on the holders of card a&s;&s;emblies on Sundays, the fre|quenters of taverns and gaming hou&s;es; the printers of Sunday new&s;|papers; the proprietors of Sunday &s;tage coaches; and others, who open|ly in&s;ult the laws of the land; laws which will always be held &s;acred by good citizens, even were not the law of God antecedent to them.</P>
<P>Many of the order whom I here
<PB N="31" REF="32">addre&s;s are per&s;ons of the tendere&s;t humanity, and not only wi&s;h well to the intere&s;ts of virtue, but are favourably di&s;po&s;ed to advance the cau&s;e of religion; nay, would be extremely &s;tartled at not being thought &s;incerely religious: yet from incon&s;ideration, want of time, want of &s;elf-examination, want of &s;u&s;pecting the deceitfulne&s;s of the human heart, &s;ometimes allow them|&s;elves in inattentions and negligences which materially affect their own &s;afety, and the comfort of others.&mdash;While an animated &s;pirit of charity &s;eems to be kindled among us;
<PB N="32" REF="33">while there is a general di&s;po&s;ition to in&s;truct the ignorant, and to re|form the vicious; one cannot help regretting that the&s;e amiable exer|tions &s;hould be counteracted, in &s;ome degree, by practices of a di|rectly oppo&s;ite tendency; trifling in their appearance, but &s;erious in their effects.</P>
<P>There are &s;till among us petty dome&s;tic evils, which &s;eem too in|con&s;iderable to claim redre&s;s. There is an aggrieved body of men in our very capital, who&s;e &s;piritual hard|&s;hips &s;eem &s;carcely to have been
<PB N="33" REF="34">taken into con&s;ideration, mean the HAIR DRESSERS, on whom
<Q>The Sunday &s;hines, no day of re&s;t to them.</Q></P>
<P>Is there not a peculiar degree of unkindne&s;s in exerci&s;ing &s;uch cruelty on the &s;ouls of men, who&s;e whole lives are employed in embelli&s;hing our per&s;ons? And is it quite con|ceivable how a lady's con&s;cience is able to make &s;uch nice di&s;tinctions, that &s;he would be &s;hocked at the idea of &s;ending for her mantua|maker, or milliner, her carpenter, or ma&s;on, on a Sunday, while &s;he makes no &s;cruple regularly to employ a hair-dre&s;&s;er?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">Is it not almo&s;t ridiculous to ob|&s;erve the zeal we have for doing good at a di&s;tance, while we neglect the little, obvious, every-day, do|me&s;tic duties, which &s;hould &s;eem to &s;olicit our immediate attention? But an action ever &s;o right and meritorious, which is only to be periodically performed, at di&s;tant intervals, is le&s;s burthen&s;ome to cor|rupt nature, than an undeviating attention to &s;uch &s;mall, con&s;tant, right habits as are ho&s;tile to our natural indolence, and would be perpetually vexing and di&s;turbing our &s;elf-love. The weak heart in|dulges
<PB N="35" REF="36">its infirmity, by allowing it&s;elf intermediate omi&s;&s;ions, and habitual neglects of duty; repo&s;ing it&s;elf for &s;afety, on regular, but remote returns of &s;tated perform|ances. It is le&s;s trouble to &s;ub&s;cribe to the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts, than to have daily prayers in our own families: and I am per&s;uaded that there are multi|tudes of well-meaning people who would gladly contribute to a mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity to Japan or Otaheite, to whom it never occurred, that the hair-dre&s;&s;er, whom they are every Sunday detaining from church, has
<PB N="36" REF="37">a &s;oul to be &s;aved; that the law of the land co-operates with the law of God, to forbid their employing him; and that they have no right, either legal or moral, to this portion of his time. The poor man him|&s;elf, perhaps, dares not remon&s;trate, for fear he &s;hould be deprived of his employment for the re&s;t of the week. If there were no other ob|jection to a plea&s;urable Sunday among the great and affluent, me|thinks this &s;ingle one might operate: would not a devout heart be unwil|ling to rob a fellow creature of his
<PB N="37" REF="38">time for devotion, or a humane one of his hour of re&s;t?</P>
<P>It is &s;trange that there &s;hould be &s;o little con&s;i&s;tency in human con|duct, that the &s;ame per&s;ons &s;hould gladly contribute to &s;pread the light of Chri&s;tianity in another hemi|&s;phere; while, by their example, they actually ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of it at home. But it is, I doubt not, much oftener owing to the im|perceptible influence of cu&s;tom and habit, than to a decided ill inten|tion. Be&s;ides, it may be in morals as it is in optics, the eye and the
<PB N="38" REF="39">object may come too clo&s;e to each other, to an&s;wer the end of vi&s;ion. There are certain faults which pre&s;s too near our &s;elf-love to be even perceptible to us.</P>
<P>There is an evil newly crept into poli&s;hed &s;ociety, and it comes under a ma&s;k &s;o &s;pecious, that they are chiefly good &s;ort of people who are allured by it; I mean SUNDAY CONCERTS. Many, who would be &s;tartled at a prophane, or even an idle amu&s;ement, think that the name of <HI>&s;acred mu&s;ic</HI> &s;anctifies the diver|&s;ion. But if tho&s;e who live in ea&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="40">and affluence do not make the&s;e petty renunciations of their own ways, and their own plea&s;ure, what criterion have we by which to judge of their &s;incerity? For as the good|ne&s;s of Providence has exempted them from painful occupations, they have neither labour from which to re&s;t, nor bu&s;ine&s;s from which to refrain. A little ab&s;tinence from plea&s;ure is the only evidence of their obedience to the divine pre|cept.</P>
<P>I know with what indignant &s;corn this remark will, by many, be re|ceived:
<PB N="40" REF="41">that much will be advanced in favour of the &s;anctity of this amu&s;ement. I &s;hall be told that the words are, many of them, ex|tracted from the Bible, and that the compo&s;ition is the divine Handel's. But were the angel Gabriel the poet, the archangel Michael the compo&s;er, and the &s;ong of the Lamb the &s;ub|ject, it would not abrogate that &s;tatute of the Mo&s;t High, which has &s;aid, <Q>Thou &s;halt keep holy the Sabbath-day, and thy SERVANT, and thy CATTLE, &s;hall do no man|ner of work.</Q>&mdash;I am per&s;uaded that the hallelujahs of Heaven would
<PB N="41" REF="42">make no moral mu&s;ic to the ear of a con&s;cientious per&s;on, while he re|flected that multitudes of &s;ervants are waiting in the &s;treets, expo&s;ed to every temptation; engaged, per|haps, in prophane &s;wearing, and idle, if not di&s;&s;olute conver&s;ation: and the very cattle are deprived of that re&s;t which the tender mercy of God was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by an a&s;toni&s;hing conde&s;cen&s;ion, to include in the commandment.</P>
<P>But I will, for the &s;ake of argu|ment, &s;o far concede as to allow of the innocence, and even piety of
<PB N="42" REF="43">Sunday concerts: I will &s;uppo&s;e (what, however, does not always happen) that no unhallowed &s;trains are ever introduced; that &s;ome at|tend the&s;e concerts with a view to cultivate devout affections; that they cheri&s;h the &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions ex|cited by the mu&s;ic, and retire in &s;uch a frame of &s;pirit as convinces them that the heart was touched while the ear was gratified: Nay, I <HI>would</HI> grant, if &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion would be accepted, that the intervals were filled up with conver&s;ation, <Q>where|by one may edify another:</Q>&mdash;Yet all the&s;e good effects, allowing them
<PB N="43" REF="44">really to have been produced, will not remove the invincible objection of an EVIL EXAMPLE; and what liberal &s;pirit would refu&s;e any rea|&s;onable &s;acrifice of its own plea&s;ure to &s;o important a motive? Your &s;er|vants have been accu&s;tomed to con|&s;ider a concert as a &s;ecular diver&s;ion; if you, therefore, continue it on a Sunday, will not they al&s;o expect to be indulged on that day with their common amu&s;ements? Saint Paul, who was a very liberal thinker, be|lieved it prudent to make frequent &s;acrifices of things indifferent in them&s;elves. He was willing to de|ny
<PB N="44" REF="45">him&s;elf a harmle&s;s and lawful gratification, <HI>even as long as the world &s;tood,</HI> rather than &s;hock the tender con&s;ciences of men of le&s;s under|&s;tanding. Where a practice is nei|ther good nor evil, in it&s;elf, it is both di&s;creet and generous to avoid it, if it can be attended with any po&s;&s;ible danger to minds le&s;s enlight|ened, and to faith le&s;s confirmed.</P>
<P>But religion apart, I have &s;ome|times wondered that people do not yield to the temptation that is held out to them, of ab&s;taining from di|ver&s;ions one day in &s;even, upon
<PB N="45" REF="46">motives of mere human policy; as voluptuaries &s;ometimes fa&s;t, to give a keener reli&s;h to the delights of the next repa&s;t. For plea&s;ure, like an over-fed lamp, is extingui&s;hed by the exce&s;s of its own aliment. But the lovers of plea&s;ure are not always prudent, even upon their own prin|ciples: for I am per&s;uaded that the world would afford much more real &s;atisfaction than it does, if we did not pre&s;s, and torture, and &s;train it, to yield what it does not contain. Much good, and much plea&s;ure, it does liberally be&s;tow; but no la|bour, or art, can extract from it that
<PB N="46" REF="47">elixir of peace, that divine e&s;&s;ence of content, which it is not in its nature to produce. There is good &s;en&s;e in &s;earching into every ble&s;&s;ing for its <HI>hidden</HI> properties; but it is folly to ran&s;ack and plunder it for &s;uch as the experience of all ages tells us are <HI>foreign</HI> to it. We ex|hau&s;t the world of its plea&s;ures, and then lament that it is empty; we wring tho&s;e plea&s;ures to the very dregs, and then complain that they are vapid.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, probably, be accu&s;ed of a very narrow and fanatical &s;pirit, in
<PB N="47" REF="48">animadverting on a practice &s;o little &s;u&s;pected of harm as the frequenting of public walks and gardens on a Sunday: and certainly, there can|not be an amu&s;ement more entirely harmle&s;s in it&s;elf. But I mu&s;t ap|peal to the hone&s;t te&s;timony of our own hearts, if the <HI>effect</HI> be favour|able to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. Do we com|monly retire from the&s;e places with the impre&s;&s;ions which were made on us at church in their full force? We entered the&s;e &s;prightly &s;cenes, perhaps, with a &s;trong remaining tincture of that devout &s;pirit which the public wor&s;hip had infu&s;ed into
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">
<PB N="50" REF="49">If the heart be laid open to the incur&s;ion of vain imaginations, and worldly thoughts, it matters little by what gate the enemy entered. If the effect be injurious, the cau&s;e cannot be quite harmle&s;s. It is the perfidious property of certain plea|&s;ures, that, though they &s;eem not to have the &s;malle&s;t harm in them|&s;elves, they imperceptibly indi&s;po&s;e the mind to every thing that is good.</P>
<P>Many readers will be apt to pro|duce again&s;t all this preci&s;ene&s;s, that
<PB N="51" REF="50">hackneyed remark which one is tired of hearing, that Sunday diver&s;ions are allowed publicly in many foreign countries, as well in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing the reformed religion, as popery. But the corruptions of one part of the Prote&s;tant world are no rea&s;ona|ble ju&s;tification of the evil practices of another. Error and infirmity can never be proper objects of imitation. It is &s;till a remnant of the old lea|ven: and as to pleading the practice of Roman Catholic countries, one blu&s;hes to hear an enlightened Pro|re&s;tant ju&s;tifying him&s;elf by exam|ples
<PB N="52" REF="51">drawn from that benighted re|ligion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, though I am far from vindicating the amu&s;ements per|mitted on Sundays in foreign coun|tries, by allowing that e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, and long pre&s;cription, have the privilege of conferring right; yet foreigners may, at lea&s;t, plead the &s;anction of cu&s;tom, and the con|nivance of the law. While in this country, the law of the land, and e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age, concurring with &s;till higher motives, give a &s;ort of venerable &s;anction to religious ob|&s;ervances,
<PB N="53" REF="52">the breach of which will be always more liable to mi&s;con|&s;truction than in countries where &s;o many motives do not concur.</P>
<P>I am not an advocate for the &s;everity of a Jewi&s;h, or the moro&s;e|ne&s;s of a Puritanical &s;abbath. I am likewi&s;e far from inferring that all tho&s;e who neglect a &s;trict ob&s;erva|tion of Sunday, are remi&s;s in the performance of their other duties: but I will venture to affirm, that all whom I have remarked con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve this day from right motives, have been uniformly atten|tive
<PB N="54" REF="53">to their general conduct. It has been the opinion of many wi&s;e and good men,

<P>I &s;hall proceed to enumerate a few of the many cau&s;es which &s;eem to impede well-di&s;po&s;ed people in the progre&s;s of religion. None per|haps contributes more to it than that cold, prudential caution again&s;t the folly of aiming at <HI>perfection,</HI> &s;o frequent in the mouths of the world|ly wi&s;e. "We mu&s;t take the world," &s;ay they, <Q>as we find it; reforma|tion is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of indi|viduals, and we are commanded
<PB N="57" REF="56">not to be righteous overmuch.</Q> But the&s;e admonitions are contrary to every maxim in human affairs. In arts and letters
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Pliny the younger was accu&s;ed of de&s;pi&s;ing the degenerate eloquence of his own age, and of the vanity of a&s;piring at perfection in oratory, and of endeavouring to become the rival of Cicero; in&s;tead of denying the charge, he exclaimed with a no|ble &s;pirit, STULTISSIMUM credo, ad imitan|dum non OPTIMA quaeque proponere.</NOTE> the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate models are held out to imitation. We never hear any body cautioned again&s;t becoming too wi&s;e, too learned, or too rich. Zeal, in
<PB N="58" REF="57">bu&s;ine&s;s, is accounted commendable; in friend&s;hip it is amiable; in all the peri&s;hing concerns of earthly things it is extolled as exhibiting marks of a &s;prightly temper, and a vigorous mind. Strange! that to be "fervent in &s;pirit," &s;hould only be di&s;honoura|ble in that &s;ingle in&s;tance which &s;hould &s;eem to demand unremitting dili|gence, and unextingui&s;hed warmth.</P>
<P>But after all, is an exce&s;&s;ive and in|temperate zeal the <HI>common</HI> vice of the times? Is there any <HI>very</HI> imminent danger that the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the great &s;hould tran&s;port them to dangerous
<PB N="59" REF="58">and inconvenient exce&s;&s;es? Are our young men of fa&s;hion &s;o <HI>very</HI> much led away by the ardour of piety, that they require to have their imagi|nations cooled by the freezing max|ims of worldly wi&s;dom? Is the &s;pirit of the age &s;o <HI>very</HI> much in|clined to catch and to communicate the fire of devotion, as to require to be damped by admonition, or extingui&s;hed by ridicule? When the inimitable Cervantes attacked the wild notions and romantic ideas which mi&s;led the age in which he lived, he did wi&s;ely, becau&s;e he combated an actually exi&s;ting evil;
<PB N="60" REF="59">but in this latter end of the eigh|teenth century, there &s;eems to be little more occa&s;ion (among per&s;ons of rank, I mean) of cautions again&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m than again&s;t chivalry; and he who declaims again&s;t reli|gious exce&s;&s;es in the company of well bred people, &s;hews him&s;elf to be as little acquainted with the manners of the times, as he would do who &s;hould think it a point of duty to write another Don Quixote.</P>
<P>Among the devices dangerous to our moral &s;afety, certain favourite and &s;pecious maxims are not the
<PB N="61" REF="60">lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, as they carry with them an impo&s;ing air of indulgent candour, and always &s;eem to be on the popular &s;ide of good nature. One of the mo&s;t obvious of the&s;e is, that method of reconciling the con&s;cience to practices not decidedly wicked, and yet not &s;crupulou&s;ly right, by the qualifying phra&s;e, <HI>that there is no harm in it.</HI> I am mi&s;taken, if more innocent per&s;ons do not inflame their &s;piritual reckoning by this treacherous apology than by almo&s;t any other means. Few are &s;y&s;tematically, or premeditatedly wicked; or propo&s;e to them&s;elves,
<PB N="62" REF="61">at fir&s;t, more than &s;uch &s;mall in|dulgences as they are per&s;uaded <HI>have no harm in them.</HI> But this lati|tude is gradually and imperceptibly enlarged. As the expre&s;&s;ion is vague and indeterminate; as the darke&s;t &s;hade of virtue, and the lighte&s;t &s;hade of vice, melt into no very in|congruous colouring; as the bounds between good and evil are not al|ways &s;o preci&s;ely defined, but that he who ventures to the confines of the one, will find him&s;elf on the borders of the other; every one furni&s;hes his own definition; every one extends the &s;uppo&s;ed limits a
<PB N="63" REF="62">little farther; till the bounds which fence in permitted from unlawful plea&s;ures are gradually broken down, and the marks which &s;eparated them imperceptibly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms of the degene|racy of morals in the pre&s;ent day, that the di&s;tinctions of right and wrong are almo&s;t &s;wept away in polite conver&s;ation. The mo&s;t &s;e|rious offences are often named with cool indifference; the mo&s;t &s;hameful profligacy with affected
<PB N="64" REF="63">tenderne&s;s. The &s;ub&s;titution of the word <HI>gallantry</HI> for that crime which &s;tabs dome&s;tic happine&s;s and con|jugal virtue, is one of the mo&s;t dangerous of all the modern abu|&s;es of language. Atrocious deeds &s;hould never be called by gentle names. This mu&s;t certainly con|tribute, more than any thing, to dimini&s;h the horror of vice in the ri&s;ing generation. That our pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be too often engaged on the &s;ide of error, we may look for the cau&s;e, though not for the vindication, in the unre&s;i&s;ted propen&s;ities of our con&s;titution: but that our <HI>rea&s;on</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="64">&s;hould ever be employed in its favour, that our <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> &s;hould ever be taught to palliate it, that our <HI>judgment</HI> &s;hould ever look on it with indifference, has no &s;hadow of excu&s;e: becau&s;e this can pretend to no foundation in nature, no apology in temptation, no palliative in pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>However defective, therefore, our practice may be; however we may be allured by &s;eduction, or precipi|tated by pa&s;&s;ion, let us beware of lowering the STANDARD OF RIGHT. This induces an imperceptible cor|ruption
<PB N="66" REF="65">into the heart, &s;tagnates the noble&s;t principle of action, irreco|verably deba&s;es the &s;en&s;e of moral and religious obligation, and prevents us from living up to the height of our nature. It cuts off all communica|tion with virtue, and almo&s;t prevents the po&s;&s;ibility of a return to it. If we do not ri&s;e as high as we aim, we &s;hall ri&s;e the higher for having aimed at a lofty mark: but where the RULE is low, the practice cannot be high, though the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition is not proportionably true.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="66">Nothing more benumbs the exer|tions of ardent youthful virtue, than the cruel &s;neer which worldly pru|dence be&s;tows on active goodne&s;s; and the cool deri&s;ion it expre&s;&s;es at the defeat of a benevolent &s;cheme, of which malice, rather than pene|tration, had fore&s;een the failure. Alas! there is little need of any &s;uch di&s;couragements. The world is a climate which too naturally chills a glowing genero&s;ity, and contracts an expanded heart. The zeal of the mo&s;t &s;anguine is but too apt to cool, and the activity of the mo&s;t diligent, to &s;lacken of it&s;elf: and
<PB N="68" REF="67">the di&s;appointments which Benevo|lence encounters in the failure of her be&s;t concerted projects, and the frequent depravity of the mo&s;t cho&s;en objects of her bounty, would &s;oon dry up the ample&s;t &s;treams of charity, were they not fed by the living fountain of religious prin|ciple.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this part of my &s;ubject without animadverting on the too prompt alacrity, even of worthy people, to di&s;&s;eminate, in public and general conver&s;ation, in|&s;tances of their un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts
<PB N="69" REF="68">to do good. I never hear a charity &s;tory begun to be related in mixed company, that I do not tremble for the cata&s;trophe, le&s;t it &s;hould exhibit &s;ome mortifying di&s;appointment, which may deter the inexperienced from running any generous hazards, and excite har&s;h &s;u&s;picions, at an age, when it is le&s;s di&s;honourable to meet with a few ca&s;ual hurts, and tran&s;ient injuries, than to go ca&s;ed in the cumber&s;ome and impenetrable armour of di&s;tru&s;t. The liberal &s;hould be particularly cautious how they furni&s;h the avaricious with cre|ditable pretences for &s;aying their
<PB N="70" REF="69">money, as all the in&s;tances of the mortifications of the humane are added to the armory of the covetous man's arguments, and produced, as defen&s;ive weapons, upon every fre&s;h attack on his heart or his pur&s;e.</P>
<P>But I am willing to hope that that uncharitablene&s;s which we &s;o often meet with in per&s;ons of advanced years, is not always the effect of a heart naturally hard. Mi&s;anthropy is very often nothing but abu&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility. Long habits of the world, and a melancholy conviction how little good he has been able to
<PB N="71" REF="70">do in it, hardens many a tender hearted per&s;on. The milk of hu|man kindne&s;s becomes &s;oured by repeated acts of ingratitude. This commonly induces an indifference to the well-being of others, and a hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of adding to the &s;tock of human virtue and human happi|ne&s;s. This uncomfortable di&s;ea&s;e is very fond of &s;preading its own contagion, which is a cruelty to the health of young and uninfected virtue.&mdash;For this di&s;temper, gene|rated by a too &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition, and grown chronical from repeated di&s;appointments, there is but one
<PB N="72" REF="71">remedy, or rather one prevention: and this is a genuine principle of piety. He who is once convinced that he is to a&s;&s;i&s;t his fellow crea|tures, becau&s;e it is the will of God, and one of the conditions of obtain|ing his favour, will &s;oon get above all unea&s;ine&s;s when the con&s;equence does not an&s;wer his expectation. He will &s;oon become only anxious to do his duty, humbly committing events to higher hands. Di&s;ap|pointments will then only &s;erve to refine his motives, and purify his virtue. His charity will then be|come a &s;acrifice le&s;s unworthy of
<PB N="73" REF="72">the altar on which it is offered. His affections will be more &s;piritual|ized, and his devotions more inten&s;e. Nothing &s;hort of &s;uch a courageous piety can pre&s;erve a heart hackneyed in the world from relaxed diligence, or criminal de&s;pair.</P>
<P>People in general are not aware of the mi&s;chief of judging of the right|ne&s;s of any action by its pro&s;perity, or of the excellence of any in&s;titution by the abu&s;e of it. We mu&s;t never proportion our exertions to our &s;ucce&s;s, but to our duty. If every laudable undertaking were to be
<PB N="74" REF="73">dropped becau&s;e it failed in &s;ome ca&s;es, or was abu&s;ed in others, there would not be left an Alms-Hou&s;e, a Charity-School, or an Ho&s;pital in the land. And if every right prac|tice were to be di&s;continued becau&s;e it had been found not to be &s;ucce&s;s|ful in every in&s;tance, this fal&s;e rea|&s;oning pu&s;hed to the extreme, might at la&s;t be brought as an argument for &s;hutting up our churches, and burning our bibles.</P>
<P>But if, on the one hand, there is a proud and arrogant di&s;cretion which ridicules, as Utopian and romantic,
<PB N="75" REF="74">every generous project of the active and the liberal; &s;o there is on the other, a &s;ort of popular bounty which arrogates to it&s;elf the exclu|&s;ive name of <HI>feeling,</HI> and rejects with di&s;dain the influence of an higher principle. I am far from intending to depreciate this humane and exqui&s;itely tender &s;entiment, which the beneficent Author of our nature gave us, as a &s;timulus to remove the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, in order to get rid of our own unea&s;i|ne&s;s. I would only ob&s;erve, that where not &s;trengthened by &s;uperior motives, it is a ca&s;ual and precarious
<PB N="76" REF="75">in&s;trument of good, and cea&s;es to operate, except in the immediate pre|&s;ence, and within the audible cry of mi&s;ery. This &s;ort of feeling for gets that any calamity exi&s;ts which is out of its own fight; and though it would empty its pur&s;e for &s;uch an occa&s;ional object as rou&s;es tran&s;ient &s;en&s;ibility, yet it &s;eldom makes any &s;tated provi&s;ion for mi&s;eries, which are not the le&s;s real becau&s;e they do not obtrude upon the fight, and awaken the tenderne&s;s of immediate &s;ympathy. This is a mechanical charity, which requires &s;prings and wheels to &s;et it a going; whereas,
<PB N="77" REF="76">real Chri&s;tian charity does not wait to be acted upon by impre&s;&s;ions and impul&s;es.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e which very much intimidates well-di&s;po&s;ed people, is their terror, le&s;t the character of pie|ty &s;hould derogate from their repu|tation as men of &s;en&s;e. Every man of the world naturally arrogates to him|&s;elf the &s;uperiority of under&s;tand|ing over every religious man. He, therefore, who has been accu&s;tomed to &s;et a high value on his intellectual powers, mu&s;t have made very con&s;i|derable advances in piety before he
<PB N="78" REF="77">can acquire a magnanimous indif|ference to this u&s;urped &s;uperiority; before he can &s;ubmit to the par&s;imo|nious allotment of wit and learning, which is a&s;&s;igned him by the &s;uperci|lious hand of worldly wi&s;dom. But this attack upon his pride will be the be&s;t touch&s;tone of his &s;incerity. If his advances have not been &s;o con&s;i|derable, then, by an hypocri&s;y of the lea&s;t common kind, he will be in|du&s;trious to appear le&s;s good than he really is, le&s;t the detection of his &s;erious propen&s;ities &s;hould draw on him the imputation of ordinary parts or low attainments. But the dan|ger
<PB N="79" REF="78">is, that while he is too &s;edulou&s;ly intent on maintaining his preten|&s;ions as an ingenious man, his claims to piety &s;hould daily become weaker. That which is long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed is too frequently extingui&s;hed. For this rea&s;on, principally, it is to be re|gretted that religious conver&s;ation &s;hould be &s;o carefully bani&s;hed from polite company. Were it other|wi&s;e, young and ba&s;hful piety, in|&s;tead of being afraid to &s;hew its head, would be cultivated, cheri&s;h|ed, and encouraged. For while we are beings compounded of pa&s;&s;ion as well as intellect, the devotion of the
<PB N="80" REF="79">generality is not &s;o purely &s;piritual as not to &s;tand in need of every ex|ternal and collateral help. Fire is too apt to be extingui&s;hed without the aid of &s;uch material fuel as is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of igneous particles.</P>
<P>Nothing perhaps more plainly di&s;covers the faint impre&s;&s;ion which religion has really made upon our hearts, than this di&s;inclination even of good people to &s;erious conver&s;a|tion. Let me not be mi&s;under&s;tood; I do not mean the wrangle of de|bate; I do not mean the gall of con|trover&s;y; I do not mean the fiery
<PB N="81" REF="80">&s;trife of <HI>opinions,</HI> than which nothing can be le&s;s favourable to good na|ture, good manners, or good &s;o|ciety. But it were to be wi&s;hed, that it was not thought ill-bred and indi&s;creet that the e&s;capes of the tongue &s;hould now and then betray the "fullne&s;s of the heart:" that when &s;uch &s;ubjects are ca&s;ually introduced, a di&s;couraging coldne&s;s did not in&s;tantly take place of that &s;prightly animation of countenance which made common topics intere&s;t|ing. If the&s;e <Q>outward and vi&s;ible &s;igns</Q> were unequivocal, we &s;hould form but moderate ideas of the in|ward
<PB N="82" REF="81">and &s;piritual grace. It were to be wi&s;hed, that &s;uch &s;ubjects were not thought dull <HI>merely</HI> becau&s;e they are good; that they had the common chance of fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and that parts and learning were not a&s;hamed to exert them&s;elves on occa&s;ions where both might appear to &s;o much advantage. If the heart were really intere&s;ted, could the affections forbear now and then to break out into language? Arti&s;ts, phy&s;icians, merchants, lawyers, and &s;cholars keep up the &s;pirit of their profe&s;&s;ions, by mutual intercour&s;e. New lights are &s;truck out, improvements are
<PB N="83" REF="82">&s;ugge&s;ted, emulation is kindled, love of the object is inflamed, mi&s;|takes are rectified, and de&s;ire of ex|cellence is excited by communica|tion. And is piety alone &s;o very ea&s;y of acqui&s;ition, &s;o very natural to our corrupt hearts, or &s;o certainly progre&s;&s;ive of it&s;elf, as to require none of the helps which are indi&s;|pen&s;able on all other &s;ubjects? Tra|vellers, who are to vi&s;it any particu|lar country, are full of earne&s;t in|quiry, and diligent re&s;earch; they think nothing indifferent by which their future plea&s;ure or advantage may be affected. Every hint which
<PB N="84" REF="83">may procure them any information, or caution them again&s;t any danger, is thankfully received; and all this, becau&s;e they are really in <HI>earne&s;t</HI> in their preparation for this journey; and do fully <HI>believe,</HI> not only that there is &s;uch a country, but that they have a per&s;onal intere&s;t in the good, or evil, which may be found in it.</P>
<P>A farther danger to good kind of people &s;eems to ari&s;e from a mi&s;|taken idea, that only great and actual &s;ins are to be guarded again&s;t. Whereas, &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion make up,
<PB N="85" REF="84">perhaps, the mo&s;t formidable part of <HI>their</HI> catalogue of offences. The&s;e generally &s;upply in number what they want in weight, and are the more dangerous for being little o&s;ten&s;ible. They continue to be repeated with le&s;s regret, becau&s;e the remembrance of their prede|ce&s;&s;ors does not, like the remem|brance of formal, actual crimes, a&s;|&s;ume a body and a &s;hape, and terrify by the impre&s;&s;ion of particular &s;cenes and circum&s;tances. While the me|mory of tran&s;acted evil haunts a tender con&s;cience by perpetual ap|parition; omitted duty, having no
<PB N="86" REF="85">local or per&s;onal exi&s;tence, not being recorded by &s;tanding acts and deeds, and having no di&s;tinct image to which the mind may recur, &s;inks into quiet oblivion, without deeply wounding the con&s;cience, or tor|menting the imagination. The&s;e omi&s;&s;ions were, perhaps, among the "&s;ecret &s;ins," from which the royal penitent &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be clean&s;ed: and it is worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, that the&s;e are the offences again&s;t which the Go&s;pel pronounces very alarming denunciations. It is not le&s;s again&s;t negative than actual evil, that affec|tionate
<PB N="87" REF="86">exhortation, lively remon|&s;trance, and pointed parable, are exhau&s;ted. It is again&s;t the tree which bore NO fruit, the lamp which had NO oil, the unprofitable &s;ervant who made NO u&s;e of his talent, that the &s;evere &s;entence is denounced; as well as again&s;t <HI>corrupt</HI> fruit, <HI>bad</HI> oil, and talents <HI>ill</HI> employed. We are led to believe, from the &s;ame high authority, that omitted duties, and neglected opportunities, will furni&s;h no incon&s;iderable portion of our future condemnation. A very awful part of the deci&s;ion, in the great day of account, &s;eems to be
<PB N="88" REF="87">re&s;erved merely for omi&s;&s;ions and negatives. Ye gave me NO meat; ye gave me NO drink; ye took me NOT in; ye vi&s;ited me NOT. On the puni&s;hment attending po&s;itive crimes, as being more naturally ob|vious, more logically con&s;equent, it was not, perhaps, thought &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e which &s;till further impedes the reception of religion even among the well-di&s;po&s;ed, is, that garment of &s;adne&s;s in which people delight to &s;uppo&s;e her dre&s;&s;ed; and that life of hard au&s;terity, and
<PB N="89" REF="88">pining ab&s;tinence, which they pre|tend &s;he enjoins her di&s;ciples. And it were well if this were only the mi&s;|repre&s;entation of her declared ene|mies; but, unhappily, it is the too frequent mi&s;conception of her inju|dicious friends. But &s;uch an over|charged picture is not more unamia|ble than it is unlike: for I will venture to affirm, that Religion, with all her beautiful and becoming &s;anc|tity, impo&s;es fewer &s;acrifices, not only of rational, but of plea&s;urable enjoyment, than the uncontrolled dominion of any one vice. Her &s;ervice is not only perfect &s;afety,
<PB N="90" REF="89">but perfect freedom. She is not &s;o tyrannizing as Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o exacting as the World, nor &s;o de&s;potic as Fa&s;hion. Let us try the ca&s;e by a parallel, and examine it, not as affecting our virtue, but our plea|&s;ure. Does Religion forbid the cheerful enjoyments of life as rigo|rou&s;ly as Avarice forbids them? Does &s;he require &s;uch &s;acrifices of our ea&s;e as Ambition? or &s;uch re|nunciations of our quiet as Pride? Does Devotion <HI>murder &s;leep</HI> like Di&s;&s;ipation? Does &s;he de&s;troy Health like Intemperance? Does &s;he anni|hilate Fortune like Gaming? Does
<PB N="91" REF="90">&s;he imbitter Life like Di&s;cord; or abridge it like Duelling? Does Reli|gion impo&s;e more vigilance than Su&s;|picion? or half as many mortifications as Vanity? Vice has her martyrs: and the mo&s;t au&s;tere and &s;elf-denying A&s;cetic (who mi&s;takes the genius of Chri&s;tianity almo&s;t as much as her enemies) never tormented him&s;elf with &s;uch cruel and cau&s;ele&s;s &s;eve|rity as that with which Envy lace|rates her unhappy votaries. World|ly honour obliges us to be at the trouble of re&s;enting injuries; but Religion &s;pares us that inconvenience by commanding us to forgive them;
<PB N="92" REF="91">and by this injunction con&s;ults our happine&s;s no le&s;s than our virtue; for the torment of con&s;tantly hating any one mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t, equal to the &s;in of it.&mdash;If this e&s;timate be fairly made, then is the balance clearly on the &s;ide of Religion even in the article of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is an infirmity not uncommon to good kind of people, to comfort them&s;elves that they live in the exer|ci&s;e of &s;ome one natural good quality, and to make a religious merit of a con&s;titutional happine&s;s. They have al&s;o a &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;eparate
<PB N="93" REF="92">what God has joined; belief and practice; the creed and the com|mandments; actions and motives; moral duty and religious obedience. Whereas, you will hardly find, in all the New Te&s;tament, a moral, or a &s;ocial virtue that is not hedged in by &s;ome religious injunction: &s;carce|ly a good action enjoined towards others, but it is connected to &s;ome exhortation to per&s;onal purity. All the charities of benevolence are, in general, &s;o agreeable to the natural make of the heart, that it is a very tender mercy of God to have made that a duty, which, to finer &s;pirits,
<PB N="94" REF="93">would have been irre&s;i&s;tible as an inclination; and to annex the highe&s;t future reward to the greate&s;t pre&s;ent plea&s;ure. But in order to give a religious &s;anction to a &s;ocial virtue, the duty of vi&s;iting the fatherle&s;s and widow in their affliction, is in|&s;eparably attached to the difficult and &s;elf-denying injunction of keep|ing our&s;elves un&s;potted from the world. This adjunct is the more needful, as many are apt to make a kind of moral commutation, and to allow them&s;elves &s;o much plea&s;ure in exchange for &s;o much charity. But one good quality can never &s;tand proxy for another. The Chri&s;|tian
<PB N="95" REF="94">virtues derive their highe&s;t lu&s;tre from a&s;&s;ociation: they have &s;uch a &s;pirit of &s;ociety, that they are weak and imperfect when &s;olitary; their radiance is brightened by commu|nication, and their natural &s;trength multiplied by their alliance with each other.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that good &s;ort of people &s;ometimes u&s;e religion as the voluptuous u&s;e phy&s;ic. As the latter employ medicine to make health agree with luxury, the former con&s;ider religion as a medium to reconcile peace of con&s;cience with a
<PB N="96" REF="95">life of plea&s;ure. But no moral che|mi&s;try can blend natural contradic|tions; the world will &s;till be upper|mo&s;t, and religion will di&s;dain to coale&s;ce with its antipathy.</P>
<P>Let me not be &s;u&s;pected of in|tending to in&s;inuate that religion en|courages men to fly from &s;ociety, and hide them&s;elves in &s;olitudes: to renounce the generous and impor|tant duties of active life, for the vi&s;ionary, cold, and fruitle&s;s virtues of an Hermitage, or a Cloy&s;ter. No: the mi&s;chief ari&s;es not from our living in the world, but from the
<PB N="97" REF="96">world living in us; occupying our hearts, and monopolizing our affec|tions. Action is the life of virtue, and the world is the noble&s;t theatre of action. Perhaps &s;ome of the mo&s;t perfect patterns of human con|duct may be found in the mo&s;t pub|lic &s;tations, and among the bu&s;ie&s;t orders of mankind. It is, indeed, a &s;cene of trial, but the glory of the triumph is proportioned to the peril of the conflict. A &s;en&s;e of danger quickens circum&s;pection, and makes virtue more vigilant. Lot maintain|ed his integrity in a great city, pro|verbially
<PB N="98" REF="97">wicked, and forfeited it in the bo&s;om of retirement.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that worldly good &s;ort of people are a greater credit to their profe&s;&s;ion, by exhibiting more cheerfulne&s;s, gaiety and hap|pine&s;s, than are vi&s;ible in &s;erious Chri&s;tians. If this a&s;&s;ertion be true, which I very much &s;u&s;pect, is it not probable that the apparent ea&s;e and gaiety of the former may be derived from the &s;ame &s;ource of con&s;olation which Mrs. Quickly recommends to Fal&s;taff, in Shake&s;peare's admi|rable picture of the death-bed &s;cene
<PB N="99" REF="98">of that witty profligate? <Q>He wi&s;hed for comfort, quoth mine ho&s;te&s;s, and began to talk of God; now I, to comfort him, begged him he &s;hould not think of God: it was time enough to trouble him&s;elf with the&s;e things.</Q> Do not many deceive them&s;elves by drawing water from the&s;e dry wells of comfort? and patch up a pre|carious and imperfect happine&s;s in this world, by diverting their atten|tion from the concerns of the next?</P>
<P>Another ob&s;truction to the growth of piety, is that unhappy prejudice
<PB N="100" REF="99">which even good kind of people too often entertain again&s;t tho&s;e who differ from them in opinion. Every man who is &s;incerely in earne&s;t to advance the intere&s;ts of religion, will have acquired &s;uch a degree of candour, as to become indifferent by whom good is done, or who has the reputation of doing it, provided it be actually done. He will be anxious to increa&s;e the &s;tock of hu|man virtue, and of human happi|ne&s;s, by every po&s;&s;ible means. He will whet and &s;harpen every in&s;tru|ment of goodne&s;s, though it be not ca&s;t in his own mould, or fa&s;hioned
<PB N="101" REF="100">after his own pattern. He will ne|ver con&s;ider whether the form &s;uits his own particular ta&s;te, but whe|ther the in&s;trument it&s;elf be calcu|lated to accompli&s;h the work of his ma&s;ter. It is a te&s;t by which he will be able to judge of his own &s;incerity, if the delight he feels at hearing of a meritorious action &s;uf|fers no abatement, becau&s;e it was performed by one who differs from him in his religious, or even his political &s;entiments.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e loo&s;e and immethodical hints with a general
<PB N="102" REF="101">addre&s;s to tho&s;e who content them|&s;elves with a decent profe&s;&s;ion of the doctrines, in&s;tead of a diligent di&s;|charge of the duties of Chri&s;tianity. Believe, and forgive me:&mdash;you are the people who lower religion in the eyes of its enemies. The openly prophane,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the la&s;t days &s;hall come &s;coffers walk|ing after their own lu&s;ts, &amp;c. &amp;c. 2 Peter, chap. iii. ver. 3&punc; with a multitude of other texts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</NOTE> the avowed enemies to God and goodne&s;s, confirm the truths they mean to oppo&s;e, illu&s;|trate the doctrines they deny, and
<PB N="103" REF="102">accompli&s;h the predictions they di&s;|believe. But you, like an inade|quate and faithle&s;s prop, overturn the edifice which you pretend to &s;upport.&mdash;When an acute and keen-eyed infidel mea&s;ures your lives with the rule by which you profe&s;s to walk; he finds &s;o little analogy between them, the copy is &s;o unlike the pattern, that this incon&s;i&s;tency of yours is the pa&s;s through which his mo&s;t dangerous attack is made. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that of all the arguments, which the malignant in|du&s;try of infidelity has been able to mu&s;ter, the conduct of profe&s;&s;ing
<PB N="104" REF="103">Chri&s;tians &s;eems to me to be the only one which is really capable of &s;taggering a man of &s;en&s;e.&mdash;He hears of a &s;piritual and &s;elf-denying religion; he reads the beatitudes; he ob&s;erves that the grand artil|lery of the Go&s;pel is planted again&s;t pride. He then turns to the tran|&s;cript of this perfect original; the lives which pretend to be fa&s;hioned by it. There he &s;ees, with trium|phant deri&s;ion, that pride, &s;elf-love, &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, unbounded per&s;onal expence, and an inordinate appetite for plea&s;ure, are reputable vices in the eyes of many of tho&s;e who ac|knowledge
<PB N="105" REF="104">the truth of the Chri&s;tian doctrines. He weighs that meek|ne&s;s to which a ble&s;&s;ing is promi&s;ed, with that arrogance which is too common to be very di&s;honourable. He compares that non-conformity to the world, which the Bible makes the criterion of a believer, with that rage for amu&s;ement which is not con&s;idered as di&s;reputable in a Chri&s;|tian. He oppo&s;es the &s;elf-denying and lowly character of the Author of our faith with the &s;en&s;ual prac|tices of his followers. He finds little re&s;emblance between the re|&s;traints pre&s;cribed, and the gratifica|tions
<PB N="106" REF="105">indulged in. What conclu&s;ions mu&s;t a &s;peculative rea&s;oning &s;ceptic draw from &s;uch premi&s;es? Is it any wonder that &s;uch phra&s;es as a broken &s;pirit, a contrite heart, poverty of &s;pirit, refraining the &s;oul, keeping it low, and ca&s;ting down high ima|ginations, &s;hould be to the unbe|liever "fooli&s;hne&s;s," when &s;uch humiliating doctrines are a <Q>&s;tum|bling block</Q> to profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;|tians, who cannot always cordially reli&s;h a religion which profe&s;&s;edly tells them it was &s;ent to &s;tain the pride of human glory, and to exclude boa&s;ting?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="106">But though the pa&s;&s;ive and &s;elf|denying virtues are not high in the e&s;teem of mere good &s;ort of people, yet they are peculiarly the evan|gelical virtues. The world extols brilliant actions; the Go&s;pel enjoins good habits and right motives: it &s;eldom inculcates tho&s;e &s;plendid deeds which make heroes, or tho&s;e &s;ounding &s;entences which con&s;titute philo&s;ophers; but it enjoins the harder ta&s;k of renouncing &s;elf, of living uncorrupted in the world, of &s;ubduing be&s;etting &s;ins, and of not thinking of our&s;elves more highly than we ought. The acqui&s;ition of
<PB N="108" REF="107">glory was the precept of other reli|gions, the contempt of it is the per|fection of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Let us then be con&s;i&s;tent, and we &s;hall never be contemptible, even in the eyes of our enemies, Let not the unbeliever &s;ay that we have one &s;et of opinions for our theory, and another for our practice; that to the vulgar
<Q><L>We &s;hew the rough and thorny way to heav'n,</L>
<L>While we the primro&s;e path of dalliance tread.</L></Q></P>
<P>It would become our characters as men of &s;en&s;e, of which con&s;i&s;t|ency
<PB N="109" REF="108">is a mo&s;t unequivocal proof, to choo&s;e &s;ome rule and abide by it. An extempore Chri&s;tian is a ridi|culous character. Fixed principles will be followed by a con&s;i&s;tent cour&s;e of action; while indeci&s;ion of &s;pirit will produce in&s;tability of conduct. If there be a model which we pro|fe&s;s to admire, let us &s;quare our lives by it. If the Koran of Ma|homet, or the Revelations of Zoro|a&s;ter, be a perfect guide, let us follow one of them. If either Epi|curus, Zeno, or Confucius, be the peculiar object of our veneration and re&s;pect, let us fa&s;hion our con|duct
<PB N="110" REF="109">by the dictates of their philo|&s;ophy; and then, though we may be wrong, we &s;hall not be ab&s;urd. But if the Bible be in truth the word of God, as we profe&s;s to believe, we need look no farther for a con&s;um|mate pattern. Let us then make it the rule of our practice here, if it is indeed to be the rule of our judg|ment hereafter.</P>
<P>But I am willing to flatter my&s;elf that the moral and intellectual &s;cene about us begins to brighten. I in|dulge my&s;elf in moments of the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic and delightful vi|&s;ion;
<PB N="111" REF="110">taking encouragement from that glorious prophecy, that <Q>of the increa&s;e of his government there &s;hall be no end.</Q> A prediction which &s;eems to be gradually accom|pli&s;hing: and in no in&s;tance more, perhaps, than in the noble attempt about to be made for the abolition of the African &s;lave-trade. For what event can human wi&s;dom fore|&s;ee more likely to contribute to <Q>give the SON the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,</Q> than the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an enterprize, which will re&s;tore the
<PB N="112" REF="111">lu&s;tre of the Chri&s;tian name, too long &s;ullied with oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty, and inju&s;tice?</P>
<P>A good &s;pirit &s;eems to be at work. A catholic temper is diffu&s;ing it&s;elf among all &s;ects and parties: an en|lightened candour, and a liberal to|leration were never more prevalent; good men combat each other's opi|nions with le&s;s rancour, and better manners. We have many public encouragements; we have a pious king; a wi&s;e and virtuous mini&s;ter; many re&s;pectable, and not a few &s;erious, clergy. (May their number
<PB N="113" REF="112">daily increa&s;e!) Among the&s;e &s;ome of the fir&s;t in dignity are the fir&s;t in conduct. An increa&s;ing de&s;ire to in&s;truct the poor, to inform the igno|rant, and to reclaim the vicious, is &s;preading among us. The late Royal Proclamation affords an ho|nourable &s;anction to virtuous endea|vours, and lends nerves and &s;inews to the otherwi&s;e feeble exertions of individuals, by inforcing laws wi&s;ely planned, but hitherto feebly exe|cuted. In &s;hort, there is a good hope that we &s;hall more and more become that happy people who have the Lord for their God: that as
<PB N="114" REF="113">pro&s;perity is already within our walls, peace and virtue may abide in our dwellings.</P>
<P>But vain will be all endeavours after <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> amend|ment. Reformation mu&s;t begin with the GREAT, or it will never be effectual. <HI>Their</HI> example is the fountain from whence the vulgar draw their habits, actions, and cha|racters. To expect to reform the poor while the opulent are corrupt, is to throw odours into the &s;tream while the &s;prings are poi&s;oned. Even the excellent in&s;titution of
<PB N="115" REF="114">Sunday &s;chools for training religious &s;ervants, will avail but little, if, as &s;oon as the per&s;ons there educated, come into the families of the great, they behold practices diametrically oppo&s;ite to the in&s;tructions they have been imbibing. If they fall into the hou&s;es of the profligate, they will hear the doctrines which they have been taught to reverence, de|rided; if into mere worldly fami|lies, they will &s;ee them neglected: and to the e&s;&s;ential principle of vital Chri&s;tianity, oblivion is &s;carcely le&s;s fatal than contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="115">If, therefore, the rich and great will not, from a liberal &s;pirit of doing right, ab&s;tain from tho&s;e of|fences, for which the poor are to &s;uffer fines and impri&s;onments, effec|tual good cannot be done. It will &s;ignify little, to lay penalties on the hor&s;es of the drover, or on the wag|gon of the hu&s;bandman, while the chariot wheels of the great roll with ince&s;&s;ant motion: and the &s;acred day on which the &s;ons of indu&s;try are commanded by royal proclamation to de&s;i&s;t from travelling, is for that very rea&s;on &s;elected for the journeys of the great, and preferred, becau&s;e
<PB N="117" REF="116">the road is encumbered with fewer interruptions. But will it not &s;trike every well-meaning Sunday traveller with a generous remor&s;e, when he reflects that he owes the accommo|dation of an unob&s;tructed road to the very obedience which is paid by others to that divine and human law which he is in the very act of vio|lating?</P>
<P>Will not the common people think it a little inequitable that they are abridged of the diver&s;ions of the pub|lic-hou&s;e and the gaming yard on Sunday evening, when they &s;hall hear
<PB N="118" REF="117">that many hou&s;es of the fir&s;t nobility are on that evening crowded with company, and &s;uch amu&s;ements car|ried on as are prohibited by human laws even on common days? As imitation, and a de&s;ire of being in the fa&s;hion, govern the lower orders of mankind, it is to be feared that they will not think reformation re|putable, while they &s;ee it recom|mended only, and not practi&s;ed, by their betters. A precept counter|acted by an example, is wor&s;e than fruitle&s;s, it is ridiculous: and the common people will be tempted to &s;et an inferior value on goodne&s;s,
<PB N="119" REF="118">when they find it is only expected from the lower ranks. They can|not &s;urely but &s;mile at the di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s of their &s;uperiors, who, while they &s;eem anxiou&s;ly concerned to &s;ave others, are &s;o little &s;olicitous about their own &s;tate. The ambi|tious vulgar will hardly reli&s;h a &s;al|vation which is only intended for Plebeians; nor will they be apt to entertain very exalted notions of that promi&s;ed future reward, the road to which they perceive their betters are &s;o much more earne&s;t to point out to <HI>them,</HI> than to walk in them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119">It was not by inflicting pains and penalties that Chri&s;tianity fir&s;t made its way into the world: the divine truths it inculcated received irre&s;i&s;ti|ble confirmation from the LIVES, PRACTICES, and EXAMPLES, of its venerable profe&s;&s;ors. The&s;e were arguments which no popular preju|dice could re&s;i&s;t, no Jewi&s;h logic refute, and no Pagan per&s;ecution di&s;credit. Had the primitive Chri&s;|tians only <HI>prai&s;ed</HI> and <HI>promulgated</HI> the mo&s;t perfect religion the world ever &s;aw, it could have produced but very &s;lender effects on the faith and manners of the people, if the

<P>THE public favour having al|ready brought this little E&s;&s;ay to a &s;econd edition, the author has been &s;edulous to di&s;cover any par|ticular objections that have been made to it.

<PB N="123" REF="122">all the u&s;ual occupations of the day, without &s;ub&s;tituting any others in their &s;tead; and that it only pulls down a wrong &s;y&s;tem, without &s;o much as attempting to build up a right one. The author begs leave to ob&s;erve in his own defence, that, in animadverting on error, he pur|po&s;ely avoided in&s;i&s;ting on obvious duty. To tell people what they al|ready know to be right was le&s;s the intention of this addre&s;s, than to ob|&s;erve upon practices which long ha|bit had prevented them from per|ceiving to be wrong. Sen&s;ible and well-meaning per&s;ons can hardly be
<PB N="124" REF="123">at a lo&s;s on a &s;ubject which has ex|hau&s;ted precept and wearied exhor|tation. To have expatiated on it, would only have been to repeat what is already known and acknowledged to be right, even by tho&s;e whom the hurry of engagements will not allow to take breath one day in a week, that they may run the race of plea&s;ure with more alacrity on the other fix. But, probably, it is not the duties, but the amu&s;ements appropriated to the day, about which the inquiry is made. It will, perhaps, be found that the intervals of a Sunday regu|larly devoted to all its rea&s;onable
<PB N="125" REF="124">and obvious duties, are not likely to be &s;o very tedious, but that they might be ea&s;ily and plea&s;antly filled up by cheerful, innocent, and in|&s;tructive conver&s;ation. Human de|lights would be very circum&s;cribed indeed, if the practices here noticed as erroneous, included the whole cir|cle of enjoyment. Are the plea&s;ures of retirement, the plea&s;ures of friend|&s;hip, the plea&s;ures of intellect, and the plea&s;ures of beneficence, to be e&s;timated as nothing?</P>
<P>There will not be found, perhaps, a &s;ingle per&s;on who &s;hall honour
<PB N="126" REF="125">the&s;e pages with a peru&s;al, who has not been repeatedly told, with an air of impo&s;ing gravity, by tho&s;e who produce cards on a Sunday evening, <HI>that it is better to play than to talk &s;candal.</HI> Before this pithy axiom was invented, it was not perhaps &s;u&s;pected that Sunday gam|ing would ever be adduced as an ar|gument in favour of morals. With|out entering into the comparative excellence of the&s;e two occupations, or pre&s;uming to determine which has a claim to pre-eminence of piety, one may venture to be thankful that the&s;e alternatives do not &s;eem to
<PB N="127" REF="126">empty the whole &s;tock of human re|&s;ource.</P>
<P>People in the gay and elegant &s;cenes of life, are perpetually com|plaining that an exten&s;ive acquaint|ance, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being con|&s;tantly engaged in large circles and mixed a&s;&s;emblies, leave them little lei&s;ure for family enjoyment, &s;elect conver&s;ation, and dome&s;tic delights. Others, with no le&s;s earne&s;tne&s;s, la|ment that the hurry of public &s;ta|tions, and the nece&s;&s;ary demands of active life, allow them no time for any but frivolous reading. Now the re|currence
<PB N="128" REF="127">of one Sunday in every week, &s;eems to hold out an inviting reme|dy for both the&s;e evils. The &s;weet and delightful plea&s;ures of family &s;ociety might then be uninterruptedly enjoyed, by the habitual exclu&s;ion of trifling and idle vi&s;itors, who do not come to &s;ee their friends, but to get rid of them&s;elves. Per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, living in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and con|nected by the clo&s;e&s;t ties, whom bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure keep a&s;under during the greate&s;t part of the week, would then have an opportunity of &s;pending a little time together, and of cultivating that friend&s;hip for
<PB N="129" REF="128">each other, and that affection for their children, to which the pre&s;ent manners are not <HI>very</HI> favourable. As to the other &s;et of complainers, tho&s;e who can find no time to read; this interval naturally pre&s;ents it|&s;elf; and it luckily happens, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t enlightened men the world ever &s;aw have, not unfre|quently, devoted their rare talents to &s;ubjects peculiarly &s;uited to this day; and that not merely in the di|dactic form of &s;ermons, which men of the world affect to di&s;dain; but in every alluring &s;hape which human ingenuity could a&s;&s;ume. It
<PB N="130" REF="129">luckily happens, among a thou&s;and other in&s;tances, that the deepe&s;t metaphy&s;ician,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke, Newton, Milton, Butler, Addi&s;on, Bacon, Boyle.</NOTE> the greate&s;t a&s;tro|nomer, the &s;ublime&s;t poet, the acu|te&s;t rea&s;oner, the polite&s;t writer, the mo&s;t con&s;ummate philo&s;opher, and the profounde&s;t inve&s;tigator of nature, which this, or perhaps any country has produced, have all written on &s;uch &s;ubjects as are analogous to the bu&s;ine&s;s of this day. Such authors as the&s;e, even wits, philo&s;ophers, and men of the world,
<PB N="131" REF="130">mu&s;t acknowledge that it is not bi|gotry to read, nor enthu&s;ia&s;m to commend. Of this illu&s;trious groupe only <HI>one</HI> was a clergyman, which to &s;ome readers will be a &s;trong re|commendation: though it is a little hard that the fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s of mo|dern ta&s;te &s;hould undervalue the learned and pious labours of divines, only becau&s;e they are <HI>profe&s;&s;ional.</HI> In every other function, a man's compo&s;itions are not the le&s;s e&s;teem|ed becau&s;e they peculiarly belong to his more immediate bu&s;ine&s;s. Black&s;tone's opinions in juri&s;pru|dence are of unque&s;tionable vali|dity,
<PB N="132" REF="131">though he was a lawyer; Sydenham is &s;till con&s;ulted as ora|cular in fevers, in &s;pite of his having been a phy&s;ician; and the commen|taries of Cae&s;ar are of e&s;tabli&s;hed authority in military operations, notwith&s;tanding he was a &s;oldier.</P>
